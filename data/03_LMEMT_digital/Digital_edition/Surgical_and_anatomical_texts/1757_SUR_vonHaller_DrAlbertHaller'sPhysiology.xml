                    <lb/>the cellular web-like ſubſtance <lb/>is made up of fibres and plates, which
                    are <lb/>neither hollow nor vaſcular, but ſolid; <w part="I">al-</w><lb/><w

                        part="I">diffe-</w><lb/><w part="F">rences</w> of its fabric are the
                    following. In <lb/>ſome parts of the body it is open and looſe, <lb/>being
                    formed of long and diſtant plates; in <lb/>others, it is thin and compact, being
                    made <lb/>up of ſhort fibres, concreted together. I <lb/>find it thineſt and of
                    the ſhorteſt fibres, <w part="I">be-</w><lb/><w part="F">twixt</w> the

                    mater <lb/>of the brain. I alſo find it very thin, but <lb/>more tender and
                    conſpicuous, betwixt every <lb/>two coats of the inteſtines, ſtomach, bladder
                    <lb/>and ureters: 'tis alſo thin and empty under <lb/>the ſkin of the penis,
                    forehead, and in the <lb/>lungs, in which laſt we call it veſicles. 'Tis
                    <lb/>compoſed of yet longer fibres, where it is <lb/>extended over the larger
                    veſſels, under the <lb/>name of a capſule or vagina; as through the
                    <lb/>viſcera, and particularly the liver and lungs. <lb/>Its principal uſe is to

                    veſſels and fibres in ſuch <lb/>a manner as to allow them a due or limited
                    <lb/>motion. But the cellular ſubſtance, ſo far <pb n="17"/><lb/>as we have
                    hitherto deſcribed it, hardly ever <lb/>admits of any fat into the cells; which
                    are <lb/>rather moiſtened by a watry vapour. that is <lb/>ſomewhat gelatinous
                    and oily, exhaled out <lb/>of the arteries and received again into the

                        part="I">inflam-</w><lb/><w part="F">mation</w> too glutinous, or, from any
                    cauſe, <lb/>abſent or aboliſhed, the ſmall fibres grow one <lb/>to another, and
                    the contiguous membranes <lb/>or plates are cemented into one, with a loſs

                    ſo free and ſhort, that <lb/>there muſt needs be very large mouths by <lb/>which
                    they open, and by which they give <lb/>admittance to injefted mercury, air,

                    is <lb/>ſeperated and expelled from the artery, not <lb/>by any long ducts, but
                    by tranſuding on all <lb/>ſides through the whole extent of the veſſel;
                    <lb/>inſomuch that when an artery is filled or <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w

                    cellular ſubſtance, but what <lb/>ſwells with the moiſture. How quickly it
                    <lb/>is collected from the arteries, appears from the <lb/>ſpeedy renovation of
                    it, by a returning fatneſs <lb/>after acute diſeaſes. See §. 25. </p>
                <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 21. But this return of the fat abſorbed <lb/>by the veins,
                    we are taught from the ſudden <lb/>effects which labour or exerciſe of the
                    <lb/>muſcles more eſpecially has in conſuming <lb/>the oil of very fat animals;
                    alſo from the <pb n="19"/><lb/>conſumption of our fat in fevers, snd from

                    <lb/>ſpread upon, the adipoſe cells, is an <w part="I">impro-</w><lb/><w

                    and unirritable,</p>
                <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 22. With regard to the ſponge-like <lb/>communications of
                    this ſubſtance, 'tis <w part="I">re-</w><lb/><w part="F">markable</w>, the

                    in the <lb/>cellular membrane, are every where open, <lb/>and agree in forming
                    one continuous cavity <lb/>throughout the whole body. This appears <lb/>from the
                    inflation which butchers make by a <lb/>wound of the ſkin, and which being once
                    <lb/>received into this ſubſtance, is eaſily driven ſo <lb/>as to raiſe the ſkin
                    all over the body; and <lb/>likewiſe from an emphyſema, in which the <lb/>air
                    received by a wound of the ſkin, being <lb/>retained, cauſes a ſwelling
                    throughout the <lb/>whole ſurface of the body; and finally from <lb/>diſeaſes,
                    in which a watry or ferous humour <lb/>is depoſited into all the cells of this
                    net-like <lb/>ſubſtance, throughout the body. That none <pb n="20"/><lb/>of the
                    cellular fabric is excepted from this <lb/>communication, appears from wounds or
                        <w part="I">ac-</w><lb/><w part="F">cidents</w>, wherein even the vitreous

                    ſubſtance, in the animal fabric, <lb/>muſt be evident to all who conſider that
                    from <lb/>this part alone proceeds the due and healthy <lb/>firmneſs, ſtrength

                    makes a perſon ſhort-breathed <lb/>and liable to an apoplexy or a dropſy. The

                    <p rend="space indent"><lb/>§. 45. The <hi rend="italic">veins</hi>, in many
                        particulars, <lb/>(§, 36.) reſemble the arteries. Their baſis <lb/>is in the
                        ventricles of the heart, and their <lb/>apices in the extremity of each
                        branch thro' <lb/>all parts of the body, excepting one inſtance <lb/>in the
                        liver. And, in a great number of <lb/>parts, they run parallel with the
                        arteries, one <lb/>by the ſide of the other. But the veins <w part="I"
                            >dif-</w><lb/><w part="F">fer</w> from the arteries in various reſpects,
                        as <lb/>we ſhall now ſee.</p>
                    <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 46. The membranous fabric of the <lb/>veins is thin,
                        every where ſmooth, and very <lb/>difficultly ſeparable into diſtinct coats
                        or <lb/>membranes, in which there are but few <lb/>places, wherein one can
                        demonſtrate <w part="I">muſcu-</w><lb/><w part="F">lar</w> fibres.
                        Notwithſtanding this thinneſs of <lb/>their ſides, the veins are, in moſt
                        parts, very <lb/>firm, and do not eaſily burſt with inflated <lb/>air;
                        being, in moſt inſtances, ſtronger than <lb/>the arteries, if experiments do
                        not deceive <lb/>us. But they burſt much more eaſily in <lb/>living, than in
                        dead animals, as appears <lb/>from morbid inſtances in the arm, face, leg,

                        obſtructed; <lb/>or when, in dying people, the blood is <lb/>thrown back
                        again from the right auricle <lb/>into the deſcending and aſcending
                        cava.</p>
                    <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 47. The veins are much larger than <lb/>their
                        correſponding arteries, having the ſquare <lb/>of their diameter often
                        double or triple that <lb/>of the latter, and, in ſome places, almoſt
                        <lb/>quadruple; as near the emulgents, and in <lb/>the venal trunks. They
                        differ, likewiſe <lb/>from the arteries in their courſe or diviſion;
                        <lb/>having more numerous trunks and branches: <lb/>for to one artery in the
                        limbs, we uſually <lb/>meet with two veins. The larger veins <lb/>are alſo
                        branched in a more net-like <w part="I">diſ-</w><lb/><w part="F"
                            >poſition</w>, by forming more frequent <w part="I">anaſto-</w><lb/><w

                        branches, but even the larger <lb/>trunks of the veins are conjoined one to
                        the <lb/>other within its neighbourhood, upper with <lb/>lower, and right
                        with left, by apparent <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">lets</w> or
                        inoſculations. They affect more than <lb/>arteries to run near the ſurface
                        of the body; <lb/>and through the limbs, neck, head, &amp;c. <lb/>they run a
                        long way covered with little more <pb n="47"/><lb/>than the bare ſkin; which
                        is a circumſtance <lb/>we very rarely obſerve in arteries: and for the
                        <lb/>ſame reaſon, they often go out in their <lb/>courſe, to a conſiderable
                        diſtance from the <lb/>arteries. For, in this caſe, the veins follow
                        <lb/>the ſurface of the parts next the ſkin, <w part="I">with-</w><lb/><w
                            part="F">out</w> their correponding artery, which, in the <lb/>mean

                        ſome ſmaller <w part="I">ve-</w><lb/><w part="F">nal</w> branch. In the
                        ſmaller branches of the <lb/>veſſels, where they make

                        compoſe the <lb/>internal fabric of the viſcera, the veins and <lb/>arteries
                        commonly run contiguous one with <lb/>the other; but here the veins have
                        generally <lb/>a leſs ſerpentine or inflected courſe.</p>
                    <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 48. The veins have their origin, as we <lb/>ſaid
                        before, (§. 37.) from the terminations <lb/>of the arteries. They ſometimes
                        ariſe by a <lb/>continuation from the inſerted branches, or <lb/>from a
                        reflexion of recurved trunks, of the <lb/>ſmalleſt arteries. Others again
                        are either <lb/>continued from veins leſs than thoſe which <lb/>carry blood,
                        or elſe receive additions and <lb/>roots from them; as we ſee, for inſtance,
                        <lb/>in the lymphatic veins of the thoracic duct. <lb/>Other veins, of
                            <unclear>a</unclear> bibulous kind, ariſe from <lb/>abſorbing ducts or
                        orifices opening through <lb/>out the whole extended ſurface of the body;
                        <lb/>as in the chambers of the eyes, the cavities of <lb/>the inteſtines,
                        bladder, womb, breaſt, <w part="I">peri-</w><lb/><w part="F">tonæum</w>,

                            >nary</w> ſweat throughout the whole human <lb/>body: hence, we meet
                        with injections of <lb/>water, fiſh-glue or oil diſtilling from the
                        <lb/>vena portarum into the cavity of the <w part="I">inte-</w><lb/><w

                    <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 49. Not much differing from the <w part="I"
                            >for-</w><lb/><w part="F">mer</w> are thoſe veins which, ariſing in all

                        return thin vapours, <lb/>dropſical waters, and diſſolved fat again <w

                        open <lb/>into all the glands, is highly probable; where, <lb/>by abſorbing
                        the thinner humour, they leave <lb/>the remaining maſs of a thicker
                        conſiſtence; <lb/>of which we have inſtances in the bile, <lb/>ſperm, mucus,

                                >larger</hi> blood-veins</hi>. Theſe, joined with the <lb/>ſide of
                        the proceeding vein, intercept a ſpace, <lb/>of which the outerſide is the
                        vein itſelf, and <lb/>the inner the valve, which, by its convexity,
                        <lb/>ſtands out within the bore or light of the <lb/>vein; ſo that the
                        parabolic ſpace or hollow <lb/>mouth of the valves always look towards the
                        <lb/>heart: they are found in all the <w part="I">ſubcuta-</w><lb/><w
                            part="F">neous</w> veins of the limbs, in thoſe of the <lb/>neck, face,

                        branches <lb/>there are two, three, four, and ſometimes <lb/>five of them
                        together, while in their ſmaller <lb/>branches they are only ſingle. There
                        are <lb/>none of theſe valves in the deep running <lb/>veins of the viſcera;
                        and, therefore, none <lb/>in thoſe of the brain, lungs, heart or liver,
                        <lb/>or through the whole ſyſtem of the vena <lb/>portarum, nor in the
                        kidneys or womb (<w part="I">ex-</w><lb/><w part="F">cept</w> one or two
                        valves in the ſpermatic vein); <lb/>nor, laſtly, are there any in thoſe
                        ſmaller <lb/>blood-veins, which are of a leſs diameter <lb/>than the twelfth
                        part of an inch. Whether <lb/>there are any ſuch valves in the vena azygos
                        <lb/>is queſtioned; but I have, not been able to <lb/>find any. [Valves have
                        been ſometimes, <lb/>though very rarely, found in the vena <w part="I"
                            >azy-</w><lb/><w part="F">gos</w>: and at the mouths of the hepatic and
                            <pb n="52"/><lb/>renal veins: there I have ſeveral times <w part="I"
                            >obſerv-</w><lb/><w part="F">ed</w> a ſort of wrinkles in the place of
                        valves.</p>
                    <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 54. In the ſmaller venal branches there <lb/>are a ſet
                        of long, ſharp-pointed or <w part="I">parabo-</w><lb/><w part="F">lical</w>
                        valves of a more extended figure, as the <lb/>vein is ſmaller: and theſe
                        make a greater <lb/>reſiſtance than the larger valves, to hinder <lb/>the
                        blood from returning back upon the <lb/>parts.</p>
                    <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 55. The common uſe or office of theſe <lb/>valves is,
                        to determine the preſſure that is <lb/>given from any quarter upon the
                        veins, <w part="I">to-</w><lb/><w part="F">wards</w> the heart, by allowing
                        no opportunity <lb/>to the venal blood, that has once entered the
                        <lb/>trunk, which they intercept, to flow back <lb/>to the branches. For
                        ſince the coving ſpaces <lb/>of the valves open upwards towards the
                        <lb/>heart, the blood enters into, and expands <lb/>them. Thus thoſe parts
                        of the valves, <lb/>which ſtand out with a free motion within <lb/>the light
                        of the vein, approach each other <lb/>towards the axis, until the oppoſite
                        ſides, by <lb/>meeting together, ſhut up the tube. This <lb/>we know from
                        inflations, ligatures and <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">jections</w>
                        of the veins; for you never can force <lb/>a liquor eaſily into the veins,
                        by urging it <lb/>againſt, or contrary to, their valves. They <lb/>do not,
                        indeed, every where ſhut up the <lb/>whole cavity of the veins; but where
                        they <lb/>ſhut not cloſe, they always intercept the <lb/>greateſt part of
                        the light.</p>
                    <p rend="indent"><lb/>§. 56. Another office of the valves in the <lb/>veins,
                        ſeems to be for ſuſtaining the weight <pb n="53"/><lb/>of the blood, that
                        its upper columns may <lb/>not gravitate upon the lower; nor the blood,
                        <lb/>flowing through the trunks, make too great <lb/>a reſiſtance againſt
                        that which follows it <lb/>through the branches. For if, from the
                        <lb/>ſlower return of the blood into the veins, its <lb/>weight or preſſure
                        ſhall, in any part, much <lb/>exceed the impulſe, that drives it on, ſo as
                        <lb/>to cauſe ſome part of the column to deſcend <lb/>by its weight; 'tis,
                        in that caſe, <w part="I">imme-</w><lb/><w part="F">diately</w> catched and
                        ſuſtained in its relapſe <lb/>by the next adjacent valve, which hinders
                        <lb/>it from urging againſt the next ſucceeding <lb/>column, and affords
                        time and opportunity <lb/>for ſome contiguous muſcle, by its preſſure
                        <lb/>or concuſſion, to ſend forward the ſaid <w part="I">co-</w><lb/><w
                            part="F">lumn</w>. And this is the reaſon, why valves <lb/>are placed in
                        veins of the limbs and neck; <lb/>in which parts, they are both more <w
                            part="I">nume-</w><lb/><w part="F">rous</w> and more robuſt than
                        elſewhere. And <lb/>this is the cauſe, from whence varices or <lb/>herniæ
                        are formed in the veins, when the <lb/>blood, entering the hollow valves,
                        urges <lb/>their ſolid convexity downwards, and makes <lb/>the vein dilate
                        in that part. </p>
