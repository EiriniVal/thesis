        <p rend="indent"><lb/>I am ſorry I have it to ſay, That <lb/>the worſt Uſage I have met

          <lb/>ſome Regard from all thoſe who <lb/>would deſerve the Character of Men. <lb/>I have
          been driven to ſuch a <hi rend="italic">Dilem-<lb/>ma</hi> by their Unnatural Treatment,
          <lb/>that for ſome Time I have <w part="I">ſuſpen-</w><lb/><w part="F">ded</w> the
          Publication, and was once <lb/>reſolv'd intirely to ſuppreſs it. This <lb/>following has

            n="11"/><lb/>my Time and Advantages, it may <lb/>bear the Light, and yet be my Own. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>When I have done this in the beſt <lb/>Manner I am capable, I ſhall
          deſire <lb/>this following Fair Challenge may be <lb/>annex'd to my Account of Myſelf:
          <lb/>That if any of my <hi rend="italic">Unkind Brethren</hi>
          <lb/>have any Thing to ſay, which They <lb/>think will prove me too ignorant for <lb/>my
          Profeſſion, that they may do it <lb/>in the ſame publick Manner which I <lb/>have made Uſe
          of to prove that I <lb/>am not ſo. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>The Worthy Gentleman to whom <lb/>I have made an Offer of this Trifle
          <lb/>in the <hi rend="italic">Dedication,</hi> will be my <w part="I">Wit-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">neſs</w> of rhe Truth of the following <lb/>Particulars: That I attended the <w

          Hoſpital <w part="I">regu-</w><pb xml:id="page_10" n="12"/><lb/><w part="F">larly</w> and

            part="F">niſh'd</w> at that Time with a Sett of the <lb/>Beſt and moſt Rational
          Practitioners <lb/>which have been ever known there. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>I think according to the Account <lb/>of the Hoſpital, that there are
          very <lb/>ſeldom leſs than 4 or 5000 Subjects <lb/>cured of their ſeveral Diſeaſes in a
          <lb/>Year; and I believe it will very <w part="I">rea-</w><lb/><w part="F">dily</w> be
          granted by all unprejudic'd <lb/>People, that where Accidents are ſo <lb/>various and
          numerous, a young <w part="I">Sur-</w><lb/><w part="F">geon</w> may improve himſelf more
          in <lb/>five or ſix Months, than he can with <lb/>the beſt private Maſter in the <w

            >more-</w><lb/><w part="F">over</w> a Man has the Opportunity of <lb/>learning every

          afterwards, as it <lb/>comes in his Way, ought (I think) <lb/>to be ſuſpected of great
          Negligence <lb/>in his Obſervation, or Want of <w part="I">Abi-</w><lb/><w part="F"
            >lity</w> to ſee into the Reaſon of the <w part="I">Pra-</w><lb/><w part="F">ctice</w>;
          either of which will certainly <lb/>make him fearful of undertaking it, <lb/>becauſe the

          a <lb/>Man has by diligent Obſervation on <lb/>the Chirurgical Part, and a <w part="I"
            >compe-</w><lb/><w part="F">tent</w> Knowledge of the Rational, <w part="I"
            >qua-</w><lb/><w part="F">lify'd</w> himſelf to diſcharge the Duty <lb/>of his

        </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>When I came to practiſe in this <lb/>City, full of Expectation of the

        <lb/>becauſe it reſembles Water, being a thin <lb/>tranſparent Fluid; it ſerves to extend

      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>I ſhall now proceed to ſpeak of the Parts <lb/>of the Eye, as they are
        ſubſervient to Viſion. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The Uſe of the Muſcles in general is to <lb/>direct the Globe of the
        Eye, and fix it in <lb/>ſuch a Poſition, as that the Rays of Light <lb/>reflected from any
        Object which we would <lb/>have viſible to us, may paſs thro' the <hi rend="italic"
          >Pupilla</hi>
        <lb/>and paint the Image of it on the <hi rend="italic">Retina.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>To form the Image of any Object, 'tis <w part="I">ne-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">ceſſary</w> that the Rays of Light coming from <lb/>it ſhould converge and meet
        in a <hi rend="italic">Foous:</hi>
        <lb/>And we judge of the comparative <w part="I">Magni-</w><lb/><w part="F">tude</w> of all
        Bodies, by the Angle which is <lb/>ſubtended by thoſe Bodies before the Eye. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>To qualifie the Eye to perform this, <w part="I">Na-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >ture</w> has given it a ſpherical Form, and <w part="I">com-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >pos'd</w> it of tranſparent Goats and Humors; <lb/>the latter to tranſmit the Rays coming
        from <pb xml:id="page_33" n="35"/><lb/>the luminous Points of Objects, and the <w part="I"
          >for-</w><lb/><w part="F">mer</w> to refract them in ſuch a Degree as to <lb/>bring them
        all together in a Point on the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Retina.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>All convex diaphanous Bodies refract the <lb/>Rays of Light by
        Attraction, and the Ray <lb/>bends towards that Part or the Body where <lb/>there is the
        greateſt Quantity of Matter; <lb/>this in convex Bodies is the Middle. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Therefore all Rays on whatever Parts <lb/>of ſuch Bodies they fall, are
        refracted <w part="I">to-</w><lb/><w part="F">wards</w> a Line drawn thro' the Center of
        <lb/>thoſe Bodies, and made to converge behind <lb/>them at a Diſtance proportionable to the
        <lb/>greater or leſs Convexity of the Bodies <w part="I">them-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >ſelves</w>: Thus when the Eye is too flat, as <lb/>in old People, (from a Decay of the
        Humors, <lb/>or a Shrinking of the Coats, or both) the <lb/>converging Rays do not coaleſce
        at the <hi rend="italic">Re-<lb/>tina;</hi> but would paſs on if ſuffer'd, and not <lb/>come
        to a Point but at ſome Diſtance beyond <lb/>it: By this Means Viſion becomes weak <lb/>and
        indiſtinct. </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_34" n="36"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>On the contrary, thoſe call'd <hi rend="italic">Myopes,</hi> or
        <lb/>Near-ſighted People, have their Eyes too <lb/>gibbous, and the Convexity of them is ſo
        <lb/>great, that the Rays meet and croſs one <w part="I">a-</w><lb/><w part="F">nother</w>
        before they arrive at the <hi rend="italic">Retina.</hi> The <lb/>former Eyes are help'd by
        Convex-Glaſſes, <lb/>which put the Rays into a State of eaſie <w part="I">Re-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">fraction</w> before they fall upon the Eye: The <lb/>latter are help'd by
        Concave-Glaſſes, thro' <lb/>which the Rays paſſing do diverge, and fall <lb/>upon the Eye in
        ſuch a Manner, as to <w part="I">re-</w><lb/><w part="F">quire</w> a greater Degree of
        Refraction than <lb/>they would in their natural Courſe: In the <lb/>former Caſe the Eye is
        not help'd by the <lb/>Object's appearing bigger, but more diſtinct; <lb/>for very ſmall
        Objects are render'd diſtinctly <lb/>viſible to ſuch an Eye by the Help of a <w part="I"
          >Con-</w><lb/><w part="F">vex-Glass</w>, whereas very large ones cannot be <lb/>ſeen
        enough to be diſtinguiſh'd by the <w part="I">Na-</w><lb/><w part="F">ked</w> Eye. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>I don't propoſe to give any new Theory <lb/>of Viſion, nor to be able to
        deſcribe the <w part="I">Man-</w><lb/><w part="F">ner</w> of it better than 'tis already
        done by an <lb/>eminent Author; for which Reaſon I ſhall <lb/>make uſe of his own Words, ſo

        /><lb/>conducive to the main End of this Treatiſe, <lb/>which is to aſcertain the True PLACE
        of <lb/>a <hi rend="blackletter">Cataract.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>All the Rays which come from one Point <lb/>of an Object, are by the <hi

        <lb/>which is in a ſtreight Line, drawn from the <lb/>ſame Point of the Object, thro' the
        Center of <lb/>the Eye; and conſequently all the Rays, <lb/>which come from all the Points
        of an Object, <lb/>are united on the <hi rend="italic">Retina,</hi> in the ſame Order
        <lb/>and Proportion as the Points of the Objects <lb/>are from whence thoſe Rays come. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Therefore the Interpoſition which theſe <lb/>Rays make upon the <hi

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>And thus Viſion in general is perform'd: <lb/>But to know what the

        and none of them are loſt upon the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Uvea.</hi>

      <pb xml:id="page_37" n="39"/>

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>The <hi rend="blackletter">Cataract</hi> will ſometimes riſe again,

          find it <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">tradicted</w> by future Practice. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>The firſt Reaſon (which is perhaps more <lb/>obvious to others than

          become <lb/>ſpecifically lighter than the <hi rend="italic">Vitreous;</hi> and <lb/>that
          being diſengag'd from the Membranes to <lb/>which it in ſome Meaſure adhered, and <w

            >Vitreous,</hi> upon <lb/>Removal of the Needle it aſcends by its <lb/>own ſpecifick
          Levity, and places itſelf at or <lb/>near the Place from whence it was remov'd. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>The next is, That conſiſting of very <w part="I">gluti-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">nous</w> Parts, and being join'd perhaps to the <lb/><hi rend="italic"
            >Uvea,</hi> the Needle only removes the main <lb/>Body, which ſtill remains attach'd to
          the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Uvea</hi> by certain ſmall elaſtick Filaments; <lb/>which as
          ſoon as the Needle is remov'd <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">tract</w> themſelves,
          and again lift up the <hi rend="italic">Cry-<lb/>ſtalline</hi> Humor into its natural
          Poſition. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>If it remains depreſs'd for ſome Days and <lb/>afterwards riſes again,
          but being a ſecond <lb/>or third Time depreſs'd it continues where <pb xml:id="page_59"
            n="61"/><lb/>you would place it, it may proceed from an <lb/>increas'd Viſcidity in the
          Humor itſelf, or <lb/>from a Rarefaction of that Fluid into which <lb/>it's immers'd; both
          of which will perhaps be <lb/>conſequent upon an Inflammation, perhaps <lb/>from an
          Elaſticity in the <hi rend="italic">Cornea,</hi> whereby the <lb/><hi rend="italic"
            >Aqueous</hi> Humor may be immediately thruſt <lb/>into its Place by Removal of the <hi
            rend="italic">Cryſtalline;</hi>
          <lb/>which Elaſticity and Contraction of the <hi rend="italic">Cor-<lb/>nea,</hi> may
          poſſibly be too great to be overcome <lb/>by the diffrent ſpecifick Gravity of the <hi
            rend="italic">Cry-<lb/>ſtalline.</hi>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>But I muſt confeſs, if I was to give my <lb/>Opinion of the general
          Cauſe of the Riſing <lb/>again of the <hi rend="blackletter">Cataract</hi> immediately
          upon <lb/>its being depreſs'd, I ſhould imagine it to be <lb/>the lifting up the Point of
          the Needle before <lb/>I withdraw it very near back again to the <lb/>Place from whence I
          remov'd the <hi rend="blackletter">Cataract.</hi>
          <lb/>For I imagine that the ſpecifick Gravity of the <lb/><hi rend="italic"
            >Cryſtalline</hi> Humor, (being very little different <lb/>if at all from that of the
            <hi rend="italic">Vitreous</hi>) would <w part="I">ne-</w><lb/><w part="F">ver</w> be
          ſufficient to overcome the Reſiſtance <lb/>of the ſaid <hi rend="italic">Vitreous</hi>
          Humor, which is a very <lb/>viſcid and tenacious Fluid, unleſs there was <lb/>a Paſſage
          made for it to riſe again by that <pb xml:id="page_60" n="62"/><lb/>Motion of the Needle
          which I have juſt now <w part="I">ex-</w><lb/><w part="F">preſs'd</w>; and therefore hold
          it neceſſary that <lb/>after the <hi rend="blackletter">Cataract</hi> is depreſs'd, the
          Needle <lb/>ought to be kept ſome Time upon it, that <lb/>the Fluid above it may have Time
          perfectly <lb/>to reunite; ſo as becoming all over equally <lb/>tenacious, it may be
          impower'd to keep the <lb/><hi rend="blackletter">Cataract</hi> in the Poſition we would
          have it. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Another Cauſe of ill Succeſs is, the <w part="I">woun-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">ding</w> the <hi rend="italic">Uvea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Iris;</hi> the
          Conſequence of <lb/>which will be an irregular Form of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Pu-<lb/>pilla,</hi> ſome of which I have ſeen intirely <lb/>clos'd: However if they are
          not ſo, there is <w part="I">al-</w><lb/><w part="F">ways</w> ſuch a Calloſity upon the

          and leaves ſuch an Opening of it on <lb/>the other, that by ſtopping up the Rays where
          <lb/>they ſhould paſs, and ſuffering them to paſs <lb/>where they ſhould not, the Eye is

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Theſe Parts too, when wounded, <w part="I">ſome-</w><lb/><w part="F"

          become <lb/>one common Maſs of <hi rend="italic">Pus,</hi> and the Eye <w part="I"

        <pb xml:id="page_61" n="63"/>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>The Reaſon that a Perſon is oblig'd to <lb/>wound the <hi

          to remove a Film which lies in <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Aqueous</hi> Humor, or on this
          Side the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Pupilla.</hi> And this, till I know better, I <lb/>ſhall
          call an <hi rend="italic">Injudicious Practice.</hi>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>It often happens that the ſaid Coats are <lb/>wounded thro' the Fault
          of the Patient, even <lb/>when the Operation is the moſt judiciouſly <lb/>performed; for
          he not havingCourage to keep <lb/>his Eye in the Poſition he was directed, and <lb/>by
          endeavouring to fly from the Pain which <lb/>is given by the firſt Puncture of the Needle,
          <lb/>which he imagines is only to be done by <w part="I">Mo-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w>,
          and not being able to move his Eye any <lb/>farther towards the great <hi rend="italic"
            >Canthus,</hi> turns it <lb/>back againſt the Point or Edge of the Needle; <lb/>and by
          this Means, in Spite of all the Art or <lb/>Addreſs of the Surgeon, will with that <w
            part="I">Mo-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w> wound the Coats above-mention'd: But <lb/>this
          laſt Accident does not happen to a Man <lb/>who knows what he is doing, perhaps above
          <lb/>Once in Twenty Times. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Another Reaſon of ill Succeſs is, the <hi rend="blackletter"
            >Cata-<lb/>ract</hi> proving Milky: To be able to <w part="I">deter-</w><pb

          it <lb/>with my Needle I have not yet learn'd, and <lb/>ſhould be glad to be inform'd by
          any Body <lb/>who has. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Another Cauſe of ill Succeſs, which is alſo <lb/>ſometimes attributed
          to the Surgeon, may be <lb/>a ſtrange Fondneſs of Sight, which engages <lb/>the Patient
          after having been couch'd Three <lb/>or Four Days to pull off the Dreſſings in the
          <lb/>Abſence of the Surgeon; by which he <w part="I">expo-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſing</w>
          the Eye to the Aſſaults of the open Air, <lb/>brings on that <hi rend="italic"
            >Ophthalmia</hi> which we were <lb/>endeavouring to prevent: In this Caſe he <w part="I"
            >him-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſelf</w> is blamable, and not the Surgeon, for all <lb/>the
          ill Conſequences that may attend it, one <lb/>of which I have found often to be the intire
          <lb/>Loſs of Sight. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Another Misfortune, which too frequently <lb/>attends the unhappy
          Patient, is, when the <hi rend="blackletter">Ca-<lb/>taract</hi> is accompanied with a <hi

          <lb/>perhaps of as long ſtanding as the <hi rend="blackletter">Cataract</hi>
          <lb/>itſelf; this we find when upon depreſſing the <lb/><hi rend="blackletter"

            >af-</w><lb/><w part="F">fected</w> both Eyes; and, notwithſtanding all <lb/>I could do
          to abate it, the Coats and <w part="I">Hu-</w><lb/><w part="F">mors</w> were ſo thicken'd
          by it, that the Eye <lb/>which had the Suffuſion in it became totally <lb/>blind: And ſome
