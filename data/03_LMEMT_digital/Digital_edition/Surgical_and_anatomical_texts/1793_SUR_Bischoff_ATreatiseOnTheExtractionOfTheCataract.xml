            <lb/>THE DEFINITION OF A CATARACT. </head>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/><hi rend="sc"><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi>n</hi> opaque body, placed between the pupil
            <lb/>and the vitreous humour, intercepting, and <lb/>thereby debilitating or destroying
            Vision, <lb/>forms the disease termed a Cataract. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The seat of the Cataract, strictly defined, <lb/>is either in the crystalline
            humour itself, or <lb/>in its capsule, or in the transparent mu- <lb/>cous fluid which
            is between the crystalline <lb/>lens and its capsule <hi rend="italic">(humor
              Morganius).</hi>
            <lb/>In opacities of either of these parts, it is <lb/>called the <hi rend="italic">true
              Cataract;</hi> and if all these <lb/>three parts are affected at the same time, it
            <lb/>is termed the <hi rend="italic">mixed Cataract;</hi> but if the <lb/>opacity is on
            the outside of the capsule, it <lb/>is denominated a <hi rend="italic">false
              Cataract.</hi> To adduce <lb/>an instance of this last, it sometimes oc- <lb/>curs
            that either pus, or some other viscid <lb/>and cloudy matter, is found in the anterior
              <pb xml:id="page_9" n="2"/>
            <lb/>chamber, the thinner parts of which have <lb/>been absorbed, whilst the thicker
            remain; <lb/>or that a mucus of a brown colour, supposed <lb/>to descend from the
            pigmentum choroideæ, <lb/>is found in the pupil before the capsule, <lb/>which
            constitutes this description of the <lb/>disease. If after an operation of a Cata-
            <lb/>ract, the capsule, or the tunica hyaloidea, or <lb/>any mucous matter, should come
            behind the <lb/>pupil opaque, this is termed a <hi rend="italic">secondary
              <lb/>Cataract.</hi> Each of these species of the Ca- <lb/>taract is subdivided into
            several others: <lb/>to explain these is not within my present <lb/>intention; my
            purpose is to confine myself <lb/>to one of the most common species of the <lb/><hi
              rend="italic">true Cataract:</hi> I mean that disease which <lb/>consists in an
            opacity of the crystalline lens <lb/>only; and the operation for its cure is by <lb/>no
            means difficult. </p>

            <lb/>THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE TRUE CATARACT. </head>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The indications of this disease may be <lb/>divided into those which are observed
              <pb xml:id="page_10" n="3"/>
            <lb/>by the <hi rend="italic">Patient,</hi> and those which occur to <lb/>the <hi
              rend="italic">Practitioner</hi> on inspection. It is the <lb/>more necessary to attend
            to these signs, as <lb/>the amaurosis has, in the beginning, symp- <lb/>toms not
            dissimilar to those of a Cataract, <lb/>though the distinction manifests itself de-
            <lb/>cisively in the progress of the disease. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Of the symptoms which occur <hi rend="italic">to the Obser- <lb/>vation of the
              Patient</hi> in the case of a Cataract, <lb/>are to be remarked, <hi rend="italic"
              >first,</hi> that the vision is <lb/>gradually debilitated; small and remote ob-
            <lb/>jects appear, in the first instance, to be <lb/>covered with a mist, or, as it
            were, enve- <lb/>loped in smoke. In the progress of the <lb/>disorder this appearance
            increases, until <lb/>by degrees it extends itself to the largest <lb/>and nearest
            objects. From the first affect- <lb/>tion of the organ, this symptom is constant
            <lb/>and invariable, though its progress is acce- <lb/>lerated or retarded in different
            cases. In <lb/>the last stage of its advancement, the patient <lb/>is unable to
            distinguish any objects, and <lb/>there remains nothing more than a glare of <lb/>light. </p>
          <pb xml:id="page_11" n="4"/>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/><hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> The patient, in the commence- <lb/>ment and
            progress of the disease, can see <lb/>better by twilight than by daylight. The <lb/>same
            occurs if the ingress of light be mo- <lb/>derated by the intervention of the hand,
            <lb/>or a screen. The reason of this is, that as <lb/>the place is darkened, the pupil
            is enlarged; <lb/>and the result is the same as if the opaque <lb/>body behind the pupil
            was in the same <lb/>degree diminished. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/><hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> They can see lateral objects <lb/>much better than
            those which are diame- <lb/>trically opposite them, because the rays of <lb/>light which
            enter laterally, find the outer <lb/>part of the crystalline lens less obscured
            <lb/>than its centre. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/><hi rend="italic">Fourthly,</hi> some aid is frequently ob- <lb/>tained in the
            commencement of this dis- <lb/>ease from the use of convex glasses. This <lb/>may
            appear, until the cause be assigned, <lb/>to contradict some of the preceding re-
            <lb/>marks: it is, that objects seen through a <lb/>convex glass are represented under a
            larger <lb/>angle. </p>
          <pb xml:id="page_12" n="5"/>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/><hi rend="italic">Fifthly,</hi> The power of distinguishing light <lb/>from
            darkness most generally remains in <lb/>the last stage of the disease; and looking
            <lb/>at the sun, or a clear fire, occasions a bright <lb/>glare on the eye of the
            patient. </p>

            <lb/>OBSERVATION OF THE OPERATOR. </head>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The operator must examine the diseased <lb/>eye both by daylight, and in a darkened
            <lb/>room, by candle-light, and in all directions. <lb/>If only one eye is affected, and
            the operator <lb/>wishes to observe the motion of the pupil, <lb/>the eye which is not
            affected must always <lb/>be kept closely covered; as without this <lb/>precaution the
            operator may often be <lb/>greatly mistaken: for the pupil of the <lb/>sound eye being
            exposed to the light, com- <lb/>municates its motion to the pupil of the <lb/>other, and
            they have commonly one motion; <lb/>which the surgeon will find, on close exa-
            <lb/>mination of the eye affected. </p>
          <p rend="indent" n="1">
            <lb/>1. In the middle part of the pupil, he <lb/>will observe an opacity, or a cloud,
            which <pb xml:id="page_13" n="6"/>
            <lb/>is not natural, it sometimes appearing of a <lb/>white, grey, yellow, green, blue,
            or black <lb/>colour, but differing from the natural black <lb/>of the pupil: this
            colour in the beginning <lb/>of the disease is scarcely visible; but as the <lb/>visual
            faculty diminishes, the colour becomes <lb/>more apparent, and diffuses itself more and
            <lb/>more over the whole pupil, forming those <lb/>little specks or clouds behind the
            pupil. It <lb/>continues to extend itself in the progress of <lb/>this disease, and the
            diminution of the sight <lb/>is always in exact proportion to this ex- <lb/>tension. </p>
          <p rend="indent" n="2">
            <lb/>2. If you examine the eye laterally, you <lb/>will observe a black circle around
            the opa- <lb/>city, which in the beginning is large, but <lb/>in the increase of the
            disorder it appears <lb/>occasionally larger and smaller, in propor- <lb/>tion to the
            dilatation or contraction of the <lb/>pupil. </p>
          <p rend="indent" n="3">
            <lb/>3. The iris always preserves its natural <lb/>colour, and has at times more and
            less mo- <lb/>tion. </p>

            <lb/>THE OPERATION FOR THE CATARACT. </head>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>It is very seldom possible to cure the true <lb/>Cataract with medicine only; and
            those <lb/>few cases where the Cataract has been said <lb/>to be cured without
            operation, by internal <lb/>and external medicine alone, are not suffi- <lb/>ciently
            proved: it is matter of great doubt <lb/>whether the practitioner has not, in these
            <lb/>cases, mistaken an opacity in the transpa- <lb/>rent cornea, or before the pupil,
            for a true <lb/>Cataract. In the former cases, some relief <lb/>may possibly be given by
            medicine, inter- <lb/>nally and externally administered; but in a <lb/>true Cataract,
            where the crystalline lens is <lb/>not only opaque, but its whole organization
            <lb/>destroyed, it is plain that no effectual relief <lb/>can be obtained but by
            resorting to an ope- <lb/>ration. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Of what the medicines consist, which are <lb/>tried in those cases, it is not my
            purpose to <lb/>state; I confine myself solely to the only <lb/>efficacious remedy, the
            operation. </p>
          <pb xml:id="page_15" n="8"/>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The operation is practicable in two diffe- <lb/>rent methods, viz. <hi
              rend="italic">Depression</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Extraction.</hi>
            <lb/>In the first mode of practice, the oculist de- <lb/>presses the opaque crystalline
            lens from its <lb/>natural situation to the bottom of the eye, <lb/>where being no more
            behind the pupil, it can- <lb/>not intercept or prevent the rays of light <lb/>from
            passing to the retina: in the second <lb/>mode, the oculist extracts the opaque crys-
            <lb/>talline lens, by making an incision into the <lb/>transparent cornea, and removing
            theopaque <lb/>crystalline lens entirely out of the eye. <lb/>The first operation has
            been long known, <lb/>and is called <hi rend="italic">Depression,</hi> or <hi
              rend="italic">Couching;</hi> the <lb/>second operation is more novel, and is called
              <lb/><hi rend="italic">Extraction.</hi> Both these modes of operating <lb/>have their
            respective preference; but it is <lb/>generally to be observed, that the cases
            <lb/>where extraction is preferable, are much <lb/>more frequent than those which are to
            be <lb/>cured by depression. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The season of the year for the perform- <lb/>ing this operation is not material; it
            is only <lb/>necessary that the patient be in a moderate <pb xml:id="page_16" n="9"/>
            <lb/>degree of warmth, and that at all seasons <lb/>can be effected. should any epidemic
            <lb/>disorder prevail, the time must be consi- <lb/>dered as unsuited to this, as to all
            other great <lb/>operations. Violent heat in summer is at <lb/>all times fatiguing, and
            under some cir- <lb/>cumstances dangerous to the patient; and <lb/>should on that
            account be avoided. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The operator may with reason hope for <lb/>success, 1. When the patient,
            independent <lb/>of the Cataract, is in perfect health. 2. <lb/>When the proximate or
            occasional cause <lb/>no longer exists, I mean that acrimony, ar- <lb/>thritic or
            venereal, &amp;c. which might have <lb/>produced the opacity. 3. When the pa-
            <lb/>tient, after the beginning of the Cataract, <lb/>is not affected with frequent
            head-achs, and <lb/>inflammations of the eyes. 4. When the <lb/>patient can clearly
            distinguish light from <lb/>darkness. 5. When the pupil moves free <lb/>and lively, and
            retains its natural round- <lb/>ness. 6. When the eye has a spacious ante- <lb/>rior
            chamber. 7. When the Cataract is at <lb/>a certain distance behind the pupil; and, <pb
              xml:id="page_17" n="10"/>
            <lb/>8. When the other parts of the eye are <lb/>perfectly well, and free from blemish. </p>

            <lb/>But even though there should be a con- <lb/>currence of all these favourable

          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>A patient intending to submit to the <lb/>operation must be prepared: and here the
            <lb/>golden medium should be observed, to <lb/>which too many operators neglect to
            attend. <lb/>Long experience has proved, that excessive <lb/>or tedious preparation is
            not only useless <lb/>to a person who is to undergo the opera- <lb/>tion for the
            Cataract, but it is often inju- <lb/>rious. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The preparation is <hi rend="italic">special,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">general,

            <lb/>ract labours at the same time under other <lb/>diseases, which may have an
            influence on <lb/>the operation. These diseases must be <lb/>first removed, or the
            operation will be at- <lb/>tended with more hazard. such dangerous <lb/>influence may be
            caused, for example, from <lb/>sordes biliosæ, plethora, congestion from the <lb/>blood
            to the head, &amp;c. &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">general</hi> pre- <lb/>paration is
            that which is recommended to <lb/>every patient afflicted with the Cataract, <lb/>and
            who is in a good state of health.— <lb/>Every heat of the body, and agitation of
            <lb/>the mind, is injurious.—All strong food <lb/>and spices, &amp;c. must, for some
            days pre- <lb/>ceding the operation, be avoided; also every <lb/>thing that causes
            general heat and obstruc- <lb/>tion should be disused. To clear the primæ <lb/>viæ, he
            must take, a few days before the <lb/>operation, an opening medicine. One great
            <lb/>point, as well in this as in other operations, <lb/>is to keep the primæ viæ clear.

            the blood to the <lb/>head, must be removed by using lukewarm <pb xml:id="page_19"

            <lb/>pediluvia, &amp;c. &amp;c. But this regards the <lb/>special preparation; and every
            intelligent <lb/>surgeon must, without my advice, under- <lb/>stand how such complaints
            are to be re- <lb/>moved. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>In general, the preparation must be as <lb/>short and simple as the constitution of
            the <lb/>patient will permit. The longer the pre- <lb/>paration, and the more formality
            that is <lb/>used, the longer the patient is kept in fear <lb/>and anxiety: this
            disturbs the secretions <lb/>and occasions weakness in the nervous sys- <lb/>tem, and
            sharpness in the juices. The <lb/>principal circumstances to be observed in <lb/>this
            operation are, that the patient is in good <lb/>spirits, free from vexation and anxiety,
            and, <lb/>if possible, from any fear of the operation. <lb/>For these reasons, I should
            therefore never <lb/>defer the time when once fixed, avoid letting <lb/>the patient be
            acquainted with the hour in- <lb/>tended, and take him by surprise. I have be- <lb/>fore
            said, that it is impossible to insure suc- <lb/>cess; but the operator should always
            give <lb/>the greatest hope, and take all possible pre- <pb xml:id="page_20" n="13"/>
            <lb/>caution to divert the thoughts from the ope- <lb/>ration. He should conceal every
            thing that <lb/>may offend the sound eye of the patient; <lb/>he should avoid a
            consequential bustle of <lb/>preparation, and be careful not to exhibit <lb/>his
            instruments, be they ever so magni- <lb/>ficent, as these always produce apprehen-
            <lb/>sion and terror in the patient: he should <lb/>not, for the purpose of increasing
            his own <lb/>merit, make the operation appear more dif- <lb/>ficult and hazardous than
            it really is. This <lb/>practice may suit the Charlatan, but every <lb/>skilful surgeon
            must be well convinced it <lb/>is equally ridiculous and despicable. </p>

            <lb/>Care and caution are requisite on the <lb/>part of the surgeon in all operations,
            but <lb/>he should attend more particularly to this; <lb/>for though it does not affect

            <lb/>readiness which is necessary for the opera- <lb/>tion some days before; and lest
            any thing <lb/>should be wanting at the appointed time, <lb/>it will be proper to
            examine his apparatus <lb/>a few hours preceding the operation. The <lb/>delay
            occasioned by waiting for any thing <lb/>at that time is aukward, and disagreeable
            <lb/>both to the surgeon and patient, and may <lb/>perhaps be injurious. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The main point is, that the surgeon <lb/>should know well how to place himself,
            that <lb/>nothing may embarrass him, and that he <lb/>may be free from all involuntary
            motion; <lb/>he should likewise be careful to keep all the <lb/>actions of his patient
            in his power. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>You cannot sufficiently admonish the <lb/>patient to refrain from every sudden
            motion <lb/>of the head and eyes; which always im- <lb/>pedes, and frequently defeats
            the whole of <lb/>the operation: therefore this operation is <lb/>seldom practicable on
            children with success, <lb/>because this advice is useless. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Most surgeons, to fix the head of the pa- <lb/>tient, press it against the breast
            of an <pb xml:id="page_22" n="15"/>
            <lb/>assistant; but it is obvious that the least <lb/>motion, even the assistant drawing
            breath, <lb/>occasions a corresponding motion of the <lb/>head of the patient. It is
            impossible that <lb/>a man should be as immoveable as a ma- <lb/>chine; that the
            operator may have the <lb/>head of the patient fast, and wholly in his <lb/>power, I
            propose, therefore, a chair, which <lb/>I have for many years found to be useful
            <lb/>(see Tab. I. Fig. 1.). It is a strong-made <lb/>chair, to which is fastened a back,
              <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which <lb/>on each side, by means of a screw, <hi
              rend="italic">b,</hi> moves <lb/>backwards and forwards. In the top, <hi rend="italic"
              >d,</hi>
            <lb/>which can by <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> if necessary, be turned <lb/>back, is a
            little concave cloth cushion, for <lb/>the greater security of the head, and to
            <lb/>prevent slipping. As I always perform the <lb/>operation standing, the chair is
            made con- <lb/>venient for my size; and, to make the pa- <lb/>tient a proper height, I
            have different pieces <lb/>of wood (Tab. II. Fig. 1. <hi rend="italic">e e</hi>) to put
            under <lb/>the cushion. Each of these pieces of wood <lb/>has two pegs, <hi
              rend="italic">f f,</hi> which fit in the holes of <lb/>the seat. The cushion, (Tab.
            II. Fig. 2. <hi rend="italic">h</hi>), <pb xml:id="page_23" n="16"/>
            <lb/>is made in a wooden frame, to which is fixed <lb/>(Tab. II Fig. 2.) two pieces of
            iron, <hi rend="italic">i i,</hi> which <lb/>go through the holes <hi rend="italic">f
              f</hi> in the chair, and <lb/>fasten at the back, in the hind part of the <lb/>chair,
            with an iron peg (Tab. I. Fig. 3. <hi rend="italic">g g</hi>). <lb/>There is nothing to
            be observed more than <lb/>two bars (Fig. 3. <hi rend="italic">h h</hi>) to support the
            top; <lb/><hi rend="italic">i</hi> is a stand, to prevent its falling, received
            <lb/>into the notches <hi rend="italic">k;</hi> which enable the opera- <lb/>tor, by
            their different distances, to incline <lb/>the moveable top as much backwards as he
            <lb/>thinks suited to the most favourable posi- <lb/>tion of the head, during the
            operation. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Let the patient be seated a few days be- <lb/>fore the operation upon this chair,
            and bring <lb/>the seat to the proper height, that the head <lb/>may exactly rest within
            the concave cushion, <lb/>that on the day of the operation he may <lb/>not have any
            secondary things to claim <lb/>his attention. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>In the like manner have ready all the <lb/>instruments and bandages. The bandage
            <lb/>which I use for this operation is (Tab. II. Fig. <lb/>3.) a double piece of linen,
              <hi rend="italic">a a,</hi> about three <pb xml:id="page_24" n="17"/>
            <lb/>fingers broad, and proportioned in its <lb/>length to the circumference of the
            head. <lb/>At each end of this bandage are to be <lb/>fixed two strings, <hi
              rend="italic">b, b,</hi> to tie it upon the <lb/>forehead. To this piece are sewed two
            <lb/>pieces of double, dark coloured silk, or <lb/>linen, <hi rend="italic">c, c,</hi>
            about six fingers square, so that <lb/>the piece which covers the diseased eye
            <lb/>should be a little under the other piece, <lb/>that no light may possibly reach the
            eye <lb/>on which the operation has been per- <lb/>formed. These two pieces must not
            reach <lb/>below the nose. This bandage, two thin <lb/>pledgets, for using after the
            operation, <lb/>some lint, to cover the sound eye during <lb/>the operation, a thin silk
            handkerchief to <lb/>tie up the sound eye, and a linen one <lb/>to dry the tears, are
            all that is necessary <lb/>on this occasion. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>some inconveniences result during this <lb/>operation, from the necessity of
            keeping <lb/>up the upper eyelid with the finger alone, <lb/>as it easily slips clown,
            and the tears which <lb/>flow incessantly, make it so slippery that <pb xml:id="page_25"
              n="18"/>
            <lb/>it is impossible to retain it with the finger, <lb/>without either drying it
            continually, or <lb/>making a dangerous pressure upon the <lb/>eye. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Much advantage must arise, therefore, <lb/>from keeping up the eyelid without
            causing <lb/>any irritation, or pressure on the eye; <lb/>and to obtain this end, I use
            the Elevator, <lb/>(vide Tab. III. Fig. 1.) which is of silver <lb/>wire, about two
            lines thick; it has on <lb/>the upper part, by <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> a ring, by
            which <lb/>the assistant keeps it, from <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
              >b</hi> it should <lb/>be well nealed, that by this means becom- <lb/>ing softer, it
            may be more easily adapted <lb/>to the form of the orbit of the upper eyelid, <lb/>and
            fit well, without pinching. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The knife, which I use for this opera- <lb/>tion, (Tab. III. Fig. 3) is the same as
            that <lb/>improved by the celebrated Professor Rich- <lb/>ter, in Gottingen, and which I
            have found, <lb/>certainly, to be the best for this operation; <lb/>I shall therefore in
            the description use this <lb/>great oculist's own words. </p>
          <q rend="diple quotes">
            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>"The knife which I use is different <pb xml:id="page_26" n="19"/>
              <lb/>from every other knife intended for the <lb/>same purpose. simple as it may
              appear, <lb/>there are still a great many things to be <lb/>remarked concerning it. It
              may, per- <lb/>haps, be supposed, that more depends on <lb/>the hand that guides the
              knife, than on <lb/>the knife itself; and there is some truth <lb/>in this; but we
              shall soon be convinced, <lb/>that the ease and nicety with which the <lb/>operation
              is executed, depends very much <lb/>indeed on the structure and make of the
              <lb/>knife, and who would not rather use a <lb/>convenient knife than such a one as is
              ma- <lb/>nagged with difficulty and inconvenience? <lb/>One of the great requisites in
              this opera- <lb/>tion is, not to allow the aqueous humour <lb/>to flow out until the
              incision be ended: <lb/>therefore the blade of the knife must be <lb/>constructed in
              such a manner, that it <lb/>gradually increases in breadth from the <lb/>point to the
              heel, in order both to en- <lb/>large the wound as it passes along, and <lb/>also to
              fill up the incision as it is made, <lb/>and thus prevent the discharge of the
              <lb/>aqueous humour. Both Mr. Beranger's <pb xml:id="page_27" n="20"/>
              <lb/>knife and mine are of this shape, and all <lb/>others not so constructed are
              worth no- <lb/>thing. The whole depends upon this, <lb/>that the knife with which we
              are to cut <lb/>the cornea should, at its broadest part, be <lb/>fully as broad as
              half the diameter of the <lb/>cornea. The cornea is in general about <lb/>six lines in
              diameter; the knife, there- <lb/>fore, must be three lines in breadth, and <lb/>at
              least ten lines distant from the point; <lb/>taking it for granted, however, that no
              <lb/>more than the under half of the cornea <lb/>is intended to be cut through. In
              using <lb/>a knife, such as I have described, we shall <lb/>find, that as soon as it
              has traversed the <lb/>anterior chamber, and that that part of <lb/>its blade which is
              three lines in breadth <lb/>enters the eye, then the inferior portion <lb/>of the
              cornea will be divided. It is un- <lb/>necessary to draw the instrument back. <lb/>the
              whole is done with one cut, and the <lb/>aqueous humour does not flow out be-
              <lb/>fore that is finished. <lb/>
              <note place="bottom" n="*" rend="size(0.5)">* In the case of a prominent eye, this
                knife of Professor <lb/>Richter is very useful; but I think not in those where the
                <lb/>eye lies deep; there will certainly be danger in the latter in- <lb/>stance,
                that this projecting point may lacerate some part of <lb/>the internal angle of the
                eye, and thereby produce a sudden <lb/>motion of that organ, so as to disturb the
                whole operation; <lb/>therefore have some broader knives in readiness, of which
                <lb/>the blade should increase in breadth so rapidly, that the <lb/>broadest part of
                it be only seven or eight lines from the <lb/>point. </note>

              <lb/>The blade of my knife is about an inch <lb/>and an half in length. It is convex
              on <lb/>both sides: whilst the knife traverses the <lb/>anterior chamber of the eye,
              the con- <lb/>vexity of its side presses the iris back, <lb/>and keeps it from falling
              under the edge. <lb/>A convex blade also is easier pushed <lb/>through the cornea than
              a flat one, and <lb/>it does not rub so much on the iris. </p>
            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>The point of the knife must be sharp <lb/>on both edges, for the least the

                saw, in the year 1783, from the famous oculist the <lb/>brother P—II—r, a worse
                accident, viz. the point of the <lb/>knife was too rigid, and, in the coming out at
                the internal <lb/>angle of the cornea, the point broke off, more than one line;
                <lb/>they would not wait till I could send for a magnet, but <lb/>opened the wound
                in the cornea, larger and through an in- <lb/>apt manner, the lens with capsule, and
                a part of the vitre- <lb/>ous humour, suddenly came out, the broken piece of the
                <lb/>knife fell into the posterior chamber. A violent inflam- <lb/>mation, and a
                purulent eye was the consequence; the <lb/>other eye, on which the operation has
                been performed with <lb/>the best success, was, in consequence of the accident to
                the <lb/>last, affected with the same inflammation; and the poor wo- <lb/>man, after
                having suffered much, was entirely blind with <lb/>both eyes. </note> If <lb/>such a
              knife be not very sharp, it does <lb/>not enter, and, upon the surgeon making <lb/>use
              of more force, it suddenly pierces <lb/>the cornea, and lacerates the iris. The
              <lb/>great error consists in making the point <lb/>too thin, and too flexible; in a
              word, too <lb/>much like the point of a lancet. A knife, <lb/>whose point is so
              constructed, subjects <lb/>the operator almost to a certainty of la- <lb/>cerating the
              iris. It is true, that with a <lb/>little dexterity, especially if the point be <pb
                xml:id="page_30" n="23"/>
              <lb/>very sharp, the knife may be made to <lb/>enter the anterior chamber of the eye
              <lb/>with apparent ease; but as soon as it <lb/>comes in contact with the opposite and
              <lb/>internal surface of the cornea, owing to <lb/>the density of that membrane, and
              the <lb/>obliquity of its direction, the thin flexible <lb/>point is reflected
              posteriorly, and una- <lb/>voidably lacerates the iris before it can <lb/>be pushed
              through the other side. Par- <lb/>ticular direction ought, therefore, to be <lb/>given
              to the instrument-maker to have <lb/>the point made pretty strong, and firm,
              <lb/>although not rigid, nor inelastic. </p>
            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>The back of the knife must be made <lb/>quite blunt. As we push the knife for-
              <lb/>ward, its back ought to be turned a little <lb/>toward the iris; this would be
              impossible <lb/>were it sharp, from the risk we should run <lb/>of wounding that part.
              It is evident that <lb/>a knife with a sharp back, such as <hi rend="italic"

              <lb/>&amp;c. must cut the cornea both upwards <lb/>and downwards, which is quite con-

              <lb/>who only wishes to cut the inferior half <lb/>of that membrane; for which reason

            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>The back of the knife must not, there- <lb/>fore, be sharp, nor must it be too
              thick; <lb/>the thinner the better; for when it is <lb/>thick, it dilates the upper
              angle of the <lb/>wound too much, and causes a small <lb/>opening at the top, through
              which the <lb/>aqueous humour may flow out. The back <lb/>of my knife is thin, and
              therefore has not <lb/>that inconvenience. I must here take no- <lb/>tice, that the
              person who sharpens the in- <lb/>strument, very often, through inatten- <lb/>tion,
              sharpens it on the back, especially <lb/>near the point This neglect, if not disco-
              <lb/>vered, may be attended with bad conse- <lb/>quence. For my part, before I make
              use <lb/>of a new sharpened knife, I always pass <lb/>the back of it over a fine
              stone. </p>
            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>The back of the knife must be perfect- <lb/>ly straight, not bent nor curved. A
              knife <lb/>perfectly straight on the back, which is <lb/>made to enter the anterior
              chamber of <pb xml:id="page_32" n="25"/>
              <lb/>the eye, at the external point of the <lb/>transverse diameter of the cornea,
              will <lb/>easily follow that direction, and come <lb/>out exactly at the opposite
              point; but <lb/>on the contrary, if a knife be made use <lb/>of with the back curved,
              or bent, it must <lb/>happen that the point, although entered <lb/>exactly opposite
              the centre of the cornea, <lb/>will come out much lower at the opposite <lb/>side; and
              indeed always the lower the <lb/>more bent it is. It is true, this fault may <lb/>be
              corrected, by elevating the point of <lb/>the knife in the chamber of the aqueous
              <lb/>humour, as soon as it approaches the in- <lb/>side of the eye, and then pushing
              it <lb/>through the cornea. But that is a parti- <lb/>cular manoeuvre, that requires
              much at- <lb/>tention, and renders the operation at <lb/>least more difficult, for,
              the fewer steps <lb/>there are in any operation, the easier will <lb/>that operation
              be. </p>

            for <lb/>cutting the cornea is never sufficiently <pb xml:id="page_34" n="27"/>
            <lb/>sharp. This complaint is often very just, <lb/>therefore it would be better if the
            surgeon <lb/>were to endeavour himself to sharpen his <lb/>instruments, than that he
            should be oblig- <lb/>ed to rely on the word of the instrument- <lb/>maker. sometimes
            this complaint is un- <lb/>just, as bluntness will often seem to exist, <lb/>but is in
            reality produced by resistance from <lb/>the hardness and thickness of the cornea;
            <lb/>and as often from the fearful and unsteady <lb/>hand of the operator. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>All the instruments that are necessary <lb/>for this operation must, as I have
            before <lb/>said, be ready at least a day before the <lb/>operation; and the chair
            brought to such <lb/>a height, that the patient's head may rest <lb/>exactly within the
            concave cushion. The <lb/>elevator, (Tab. III. Fig. 1) properly bent, <lb/>and every
            thing in due readiness. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>From the room, in which the operation <lb/>is to be performed, all false light must
            be <lb/>excluded; and, for that purpose, every win- <lb/>dow, except the one which gives
            the best <lb/>light for the operation, must be effectually <pb xml:id="page_35" n="28"/>
            <lb/>closed. Not only a double, but a too <lb/>strong light is dangerous; therefore, at
            the <lb/>same time be careful to regulate the un- <lb/>closed window in such a manner,
            that at <lb/>any moment during the operation you may <lb/>have as much more or less
            light, as may be <lb/>necessary for your purpose. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The patient's bed must be adjacent, or, <lb/>if possible, in the same room in which
            the <lb/>operation is performed; every motion after <lb/>the operation, is not only
            troublesome, but <lb/>dangerous to the patient. The sleeping <lb/>room must be made
            dark, and carefully <lb/>preserved from any possible entrance of <lb/>strong light. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Let the patient be released from all su- <lb/>perfluous cloathing, and let him be
            in a <lb/>night-gown, or great-coat, that he may <lb/>not be, after the operation, long
            occupied, <lb/>or in useless motion by undressing. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>If the patient is remarkably timid, it <lb/>may be as well that he should not know
            <lb/>when you propose to perform the opera- <lb/>tion, for which purpose you may
            therefore <pb xml:id="page_36" n="29"/>
            <lb/>give him frequent visits at unappointed <lb/>times. If he should absolutely desire
            to <lb/>be acquainted with the fixed hour for the <lb/>operation, rather tell him a day
            later, than <lb/>that actually fixed for the purpose, that if <lb/>any unforeseen
            impediment should make it <lb/>necessary to postpone the operation, the <lb/>surgeon may
            still keep his word with the <lb/>patient. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>One cannot too scrupulously adhere to a <lb/>promise made to those who count, with
            <lb/>passionate expectation, each minute, look- <lb/>ing forward to that happy one, when
            they <lb/>hope to receive their sight. Every disap- <lb/>pointment should likewise be
            avoided, on <lb/>another account, as it tends to disturb the <lb/>serenity of the
            patient, and by ruffling his <lb/>spirits, to render him less fit to undergo so
            <lb/>important an operation. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The surgeon, to return to necessary mi- <lb/>nutiæ, should take every care to have
            a <lb/>strong chair for himself, in case he should sit <lb/>during the operation. He
            should likewise <lb/>choose as clear a day and sky as possible. <pb xml:id="page_37"
              n="30"/>
            <lb/>The light of the sun is injurious, and a sky <lb/>which is one moment bright, and
            the next <lb/>clouded, is apt to derange the operator. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>If the patient has not had an evacuation <lb/>on the day of the operation, let him
            have <lb/>an emollient opening clyster a few hours <lb/>before; and if he should be very
            fearful of <lb/>the operation, give him, an hour preceding, <lb/>one grain of opium with
            some wine, which <lb/>will be found of service. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>When every thing is thus prepared, I <lb/>now come to the operation itself. But
            <lb/>here let me remark, that in <hi rend="italic">my judgment,</hi>
            <lb/>it should be performed on one eye only at <lb/>a time, in case the patient should
            be blind <lb/>of both. The contrary practice can only <lb/>have originated in the
            precipitance of some <lb/>itinerant oculist, who, not having patience <lb/>to wait for
            the recovery of the first eye, <lb/>undertake <hi rend="italic">the double
              operation,</hi> for the <lb/>sake of <hi rend="italic">the double fee.</hi> He then
            departs, and <lb/>frequently leaves the patient in a state of <lb/>incurable blindness!
            To shew the hazard, <lb/>and to demonstrate the inhumanity of this <pb xml:id="page_38"
              n="31"/>
            <lb/>practice, it is only necessary to observe, <lb/>that the operation for a cataract
            may be <lb/>performed on one eye, with the best suc- <lb/>cess, yet, through some
            unexpected cir- <lb/>cumstance, fail with respect to the other. <lb/>The immediate
            communication between <lb/>the eyes is well understood. The strong <lb/>inflammation of
            the eye, on which the <lb/>operation has miscarried, affects the other <lb/>in its
            weakened state, and by this means <lb/>both are frequently lost. A variety of <lb/>such
            cases have come within my know- <lb/>ledge, in the course of my practice, and all
            <lb/>arising from that indecent precipitation <lb/>which I have stated. If the patient
            can <lb/>see, after the operation of one eye, then he <lb/>does not require to undergo a
            second on <lb/>the other; but on the contrary, if it should <lb/>so happen that the
            first miscarries, there is <lb/>a remaining hope of success from the se- <lb/>cond. This
            hope, as I have observed, is <lb/>totally extinguished by a double operation. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Here a question occurs, which I think <lb/>this the proper place to discuss;
            namely, <pb xml:id="page_39" n="32"/>
            <lb/>Whether <hi rend="italic">the Assistant</hi> should be a sur- <lb/>geon, or a man
            acquainted with this ope- <lb/>ration, or not? My opinion is, he should <lb/>not. It is
            supposed that an informed man <lb/>can assist the operator; but he wants no <lb/>other
            aid, than the simple act of keep- <lb/>ing up the eyelid. The assistant need not,
            <lb/>therefore, be acquainted with the opera- <lb/>tion; on the contrary, I maintain
            that an <lb/>assistant, who thinks himself possessed of <lb/>knowledge, is of much more
            injury than <lb/>use. His curiosity and earnestness to see <lb/>the operation, as he
            stands behind the <lb/>patient, causes him to bow his head <lb/>over, and to forget to
            take care of the <lb/>eyelid, or he makes a dangerous pressure <lb/>on the eye. His
            confidence may even go <lb/>far enough (if he keep up the eyelid with <lb/>the finger)
            to think that he may aid the <lb/>operator by a push, or a pressure, in the
            <lb/>operation, which is enough to defeat the <lb/>whole. I have seen many instances of
            this; <lb/>it is therefore clear, that an assistant hav- <lb/>ing any knowledge of the
            business, instead <pb xml:id="page_40" n="33"/>
            <lb/>of advantage, occasions inconvenience and <lb/>danger. I therefore should recommend
            <lb/>for an assistant an intelligent man, who <lb/>is unacquainted with the operation,
            and <lb/>attentive only to the instructions of the <lb/>operator. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The assistant should have been pre- <lb/>viously instructed to watch the eyes of
            the <lb/>surgeon, who must let him know by their <lb/>means to lift the eyelid, or the
            contrary. <lb/>It is proper to accustom every assistant to <lb/>understand by signs from
            the operator what <lb/>he has occasion for; as a blind person is <lb/>ever attentive to
            hear what passes, and the <lb/>calling for instruments, knives, scissors, &amp;c.
            <lb/>make fearful impressions on the patient. <lb/>The surgeon should rather, during the
            <lb/>operation, converse with him on indifferent <lb/>subjects, and endeavour to turn
            his thoughts <lb/>from what is doing. </p>

          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>First, take from the patient his neck- <lb/>cloth, unbutton his shirt collar, and
            release <lb/>him from every thing which may hinder <lb/>the free circulation; then seat
            him in the <lb/>chair, that is already adapted to the height <lb/>required; let him put
            his hands across <lb/>his back, or secure them in such a manner, <lb/>by a strong
            inflexible cane placed between <lb/>his arms and back, as to be certain that,
            <lb/>during the operation, he cannot direct them <lb/>to his eyes, or the instruments of
            the ope- <lb/>rator. If this situation should incommode <lb/>a lusty person, you must
            direct the assist- <lb/>ants to give strict attention to his hands. <lb/>The operator
            must either stand, or sit on a <lb/>strong chair; but in such a position, that <lb/>his
            mouth may be exactly on a level with <lb/>the eyes of the patient; the feet of the
            <lb/>latter must be stretched out betwixt those <lb/>of the operator. The surgeon must,
            in <lb/>this situation, be near to a window, that <pb xml:id="page_42" n="35"/>
            <lb/>he may have a clear light; the patient <lb/>must sit so that the light may fall
            sideways <lb/>over the nose to the affected eye; for if <lb/>the patient sits opposite
            the light, the sur- <lb/>geon himself being in the shadow, this in- <lb/>terposition
            hinders him observing if the <lb/>pupil be clear; on the contrary, if the light
            <lb/>comes from the side of that eye on which <lb/>the operation is to be performed, the
            sha- <lb/>dow of the hand, or the knife, is always an <lb/>obstruction. some pretend
            that the eye <lb/>always turns towards the light; this is not <lb/>quite certain, in the
            case of a patient af- <lb/>flicted with the Cataract. It is more clear <lb/>that the
            blade of the knife, or the hand, <lb/>always make a shadow, and that the eye is
            <lb/>otherwise too much exposed to the light; <lb/>but in this particular, every surgeon
            may <lb/>do as he thinks best. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Let the assistant be now placed behind <lb/>the patient's chair; the latter being

            <lb/>lint, and put it on the eye which is not <lb/>to be operated, and tie it fast with
            a <lb/>thin silk handkerchief, which is preferable, <lb/>because it takes but little
            room; lest the <lb/>sound eye should come into motion, and <lb/>by its communicating
            with the other, ren- <lb/>der the operation more difficult. It is ne- <lb/>cessary to
            have some wine ready, to re- <lb/>fresh the patient during the operation, and <lb/>some
            cold and warm water. The surgeon <lb/>should select all the necessary instruments,
            <lb/>and place them on a napkin, in a dish, in <lb/>the probable order he may want them,
            and <lb/>let an assistant hold this near to him, that <lb/>he may readily take those for
            which he <lb/>has occasion. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>During the time that the cornea is di- <lb/>vided, much light must fall on the eye,

            table, &amp;c. &amp;c. <lb/>to make their hand more firm: but all <lb/>these positions
            seem to me to be too con- <lb/>fined, and to hinder that freedom of motion <pb

            <lb/>which is necessary to an operator. My <lb/>method is, to press the upper part of
            the <lb/>arm and elbow of that hand, with which I <lb/>perform the operation, strongly
            against my <lb/>own breast and ribs, and lean my little <lb/>finger about an inch, from
            the outside of <lb/>the eye, on the cheek-bone of the patient, <lb/>and, as soon as I
            see the eye in a good po- <lb/>sition, I at once hold my breath, and re- <lb/>main in
            that situation while I make the <lb/>incision in the cornea, which assists greatly
            <lb/>the firmness of the hand. Though this <lb/>may appear trifling, it will be found of

            <lb/>The knife he must take in his fingers, <lb/>like a pen, and lean the little finger
            of his <lb/>right hand on the cheek-bone of the pa- <lb/>tient; and he should give great
            attention <lb/>to the motion, when the eye is directly <lb/>straight forward, but
            looking a little up, <lb/>and outwards. As soon as the eye is in <lb/>that direction,
            introduce the knife a little <lb/>over the horizontal diameter, and a half line
            <lb/>from the albuginea, in the cornea. But do <lb/>not insert the knife in the cornea,
            if the eye <lb/>be not in the position just now stated. The <lb/>impatience of the
            surgeon sometimes so far <lb/>misleads him, that although the eye is not <lb/>in the
            right direction, by introducing his <lb/>knife into it, he hopes to bring it right;
            <lb/>but, in this case, he is greatly mistaken. It <pb xml:id="page_47" n="40"/>
            <lb/>will be found infinitely better to wait the <lb/>favourable moment. The coolest
            patience <lb/>is necessary, as well as the strongest pre- <lb/>sence of mind, in an
            operation on which <lb/>depends the greatest happiness of life— <lb/>the sight. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The incision in the cornea, must be <lb/>shaped like an half circle, and must begin
            <lb/>in the outer corner of the eye, a little over <lb/>the horizontal diameter (as I
            have stated) <lb/>in the transparent cornea, and come out in <lb/>the same direction in
            the inner corner of <lb/>the eye, that the under half of the cornea <lb/>may be cut; and
            this incision must be the <lb/>distance of half a line from the albuginea. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>In this part of the operation, much de- <lb/>pends on the incision being
            sufficiently <lb/>large; and it is always better, that it <lb/>should be a little too
            large, than too small. <lb/>The only way of making the incision suf- <lb/>ficiently
            large, is, by keeping the knife, in <lb/>passing through the oblique diameter, as
            <lb/>near as possible to the outer edge of the cor- <lb/>nea. The farther the entering
            of the knife <pb xml:id="page_48" n="41"/>
            <lb/>is from the outer edge of the cornea, the <lb/>less will be the incision. The
            larger the in- <lb/>cision is, the more easily and gently the <lb/>crystalline lens is
            extracted through the <lb/>pupil. It is not my intention to advise <lb/>the incision to
            be two-thirds of the circle <lb/>of the cornea; there may be an apprehen- <lb/>sion, in
            this case, of a sudden protrusion of <lb/>the crystalline lens, and also of the vitre-
            <lb/>ous humour, and iris. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Particular care should be taken by the <lb/>operator that he performs this incision
            well, <lb/>that the aqueous humour does not run out <lb/>before the whole incision be
            finished. If <lb/>the aqueous humour flows out sooner, the <lb/>anterior chamber
            collapses while the knife <lb/>is still in it; the iris becomes then close to <lb/>the
            cornea, and comes before the point, <lb/>and under the edge of the knife. In this
            <lb/>case, it is impossible to bring the knife <lb/>through the anterior chamber to the
            inner <lb/>corner of the eye, without hurting or <lb/>wounding the iris; and to continue
            the <pb xml:id="page_49" n="42"/>
            <lb/>incision in the collapsed cornea with the <lb/>same knife, would make the wound too
            <lb/>high, and uneven, and by this means the <lb/>whole operation often miscarries. Of
            this <lb/>I shall speak hereafter. But take all pos- <lb/>sible precautions, to finish
            the operation <lb/>with proper quickness, by making the <lb/>whole incision with an even
            movement in <lb/>the cornea <hi rend="italic">at once,</hi> before the aqueous hu-
            <lb/>mour escapes. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>As soon as the eye is in the direction <lb/>that is desired, you must make, with
            that <lb/>finger with which you keep down the un- <lb/>der eyelid, a soft easy pressure
            on the eye, <lb/>as I have before said; put in the point of <lb/>the knife a little
            right angular, (then, if <lb/>you put it a little awry, you will soon <lb/>come betwixt
            the lamellæ of the cornea) <lb/>and push through the cornea. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Now the knife is through the cornea, <lb/>in the anterior chamber, change the di-
            <lb/>rection, so that the point be directed to <lb/>the spot at the inner corner, where
            it <pb xml:id="page_50" n="43"/>
            <lb/>must come out; keep the knife quite pa- <lb/>rallel with the iris, but with the
            edge a <lb/>little outward from it, and push it with <lb/>an even movement to the inner
            corner, <lb/>and finish the incision as I directed be- <lb/>fore. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>If the eye is prominent, the anterior <lb/>chamber large, the patient not very
            timid, <lb/>the eye quiet, and the operator has firm- <lb/>ness enough in his hand,
            sufficient pre- <lb/>sence of mind, and be not precipitate, this <lb/>part of the
            operation may always be per- <lb/>formed with a sufficient share of certainty. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>But, in spite of every previous rule, and <lb/>every possible precaution, it will
            sometimes <lb/>happen, through unforeseen circumstances, <lb/>or mistake of the
            operator, that the inci- <lb/>sion is not properly finished; this is occa- <lb/>sioned
            either by the motion of the eye on the <lb/>internal angle, or the aqueous humour es-
            <lb/>caping too soon, or the iris falling before the <lb/>point, or under the edge of
            the knife, &amp;c. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>If the surgeon, as soon as he observes <lb/>that the eye begins to turn to the
            inner <pb xml:id="page_51" n="44"/>
            <lb/>canthus, cannot prevent it, by a soft pres- <lb/>sure with the finger, on the under
            and inner <lb/>side, he will do best to press the knife directly <lb/>downwards, and
            divide through as much <lb/>of the cornea as possible; and if it should <lb/>be only a
            half of the incision he intended, <lb/>he can afterwards finish it with a pair of
            <lb/>scissors. (To draw the eye forward in this <lb/>case with the knife that is in it,
            and to fi- <lb/>nish the incision, requires all the dexterity <lb/>of an experienced and
            cool hand, and even <lb/>then seldom succeeds.) It is said, only <lb/>through prejudice,
            that the opening by a <lb/>pair of scissors makes a wound which is <lb/>apt to
            suppurate, and frequently leaves be- <lb/>hind an opaque cicatrix. Repeated expe-
            <lb/>rience proves, that an opening in the cor- <lb/>nea with a good sharp pair of
            scissors, <lb/>will heal as even, and as well, as if <lb/>done with a knife. Those which
            are used <lb/>for this purpose are different. I make <lb/>use of a pair like those of
              <hi rend="italic">Daviel,</hi> with <lb/>blunted points. The method of using
            <lb/>these scissors is quite simple. I lay (in an <pb xml:id="page_52" n="45"/>
            <lb/>operation of the left eye) my fore finger <lb/>of my left hand fast on the cheek of
            the <lb/>patient, to keep down the eyelid. I then <lb/>place my scissors on the back of
            the finger, <lb/>as a firm point, and make the incision in <lb/>the cornea sufficiently
            large. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The cases in which the iris generally <lb/>falls before the point, and under the
            edge <lb/>of the knife, are when it is inserted too <lb/>near the outer edge of the
            cornea, (too <lb/>near the albuginea) when the aqueous hu- <lb/>mour flows out too soon,
            when the assistant <lb/>makes a pressure upon the eye, or through <lb/>any other cause
            occasions a spasm, from ir- <lb/>ritation on the muscles of the eye, by which <lb/>the
            iris is pressed forwards. If, with every <lb/>precaution observed, the iris should fall
            <lb/>before the point of the knife, you must <lb/>try, by a soft pressure and rubbing
            upon <lb/>the cornea, to make the iris retreat, and <lb/>move the point of the knife a
            little to the <lb/>cornea, and over the iris. If the iris falls <lb/>forward, and the
            knife is in the inner can- <lb/>thus, and through the cornea, try likewise <pb
              xml:id="page_53" n="46"/>
            <lb/>through a soft rubbing upon the cornea, <lb/>and by keeping your knife still, to
            make <lb/>the iris recede, and to finish the incision. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>If, notwithstanding all these endea- <lb/>vours, the iris will not recede, be not
            pre- <lb/>cipitate; turn not the edge of the knife <lb/>more towards the cornea, to
            finish the in- <lb/>cision: it never can in this manner be <lb/>made as it should be,
            and you endanger <lb/>the patient; for the cicatrix will, after the <lb/>operation,
            appear too high, and on its size <lb/>and situation depends the sight. The best
            <lb/>mode, under these circumstances, is to <lb/>withdraw the knife, and to finish the
            open- <lb/>ing with a pair of scissors, or with a knife <lb/>with a blunted point, as
            will be mentioned <lb/>in the sequel. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>sometimes before the operation, the eye <lb/>is in such an unquiet and convulsive
            state, <lb/>that all the repose and intervals that are <lb/>given cannot make it quiet.
            If the surgeon, <lb/>retaining his presence of mind, has lost all <lb/>hopes of fixing
            the eye, and is convinced <lb/>that there remains nothing else but to se- <pb
              xml:id="page_54" n="47"/>
            <lb/>cure it with an instrument; I believe that <lb/>out of all the number of
            instruments re- <lb/>commended for this purpose, the spear of <lb/>Parma, corrected by
            Casaamata (Tab. III. <lb/>Fig. 2.) is one of the best. The inconve- <lb/>nience of this
            instrument is, that it re- <lb/>quires the whole hand of the surgeon, and <lb/>will not
            admit a finger to be left for keeping <lb/>down the under eyelid; but this fault is to
            <lb/>be remedied by affixing the little hook <lb/>(Tab. III. Fig. 7.) to the under
            eyelid <lb/>by <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> hang a small
            key, heavy <lb/>enough to keep it down: by this is spared <lb/>a hand extraordinary; but
            be sure to avoid, <lb/>as much as possible, all superfluous instru- <lb/>ments. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>In the operation of the left eye, you <lb/>take the spear (Tab. III. Fig. 2.) by
              <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <lb/>the left hand, put up by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the
            fore finger, <lb/>and watch when the eye is in the direction <lb/>before mentioned, and
            push at once the <lb/>point of the spear horizontally about a half <lb/>line over the
            oblique diameter of the cor- <lb/>nea, and half a line from the albuginea, in <pb
              xml:id="page_55" n="48"/>
            <lb/>the inner part of the cornea; in this man- <lb/>ner you can, by a soft pressure
            with the <lb/>spear, keep the eye, without harm, im- <lb/>moveably fixed; when you find
            that this <lb/>is effected, push the knife, at the same mo- <lb/>ment, into the opposite
            side, (Tab. IV. <lb/>Fig. 1.) as I before intimated, and com- <lb/>plete the incision.
            But if you make use of <lb/>the elevator (Tab. III. Fig. 1.) to sustain <lb/>the upper
            eyelid, then make a soft pressure <lb/>with the finger with which you keep down <lb/>the
            under eyelid; and take care that the <lb/>point of the knife be well sharpened, and
            <lb/>choose one which has not too thick a blade. <lb/>You will be very seldom incommoded
            <lb/>through the strong motion of the eye; and <lb/>it is not often that the use of the
            spear will <lb/>be necessary. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The method thus described, of cutting <lb/>the cornea at once, and with one knife,
            <lb/>can always be used when the eye is quiet; <lb/>but every experienced oculist knows,
            that <lb/>though before the operation, the patient <lb/>and the eye are quiet, he cannot
            rely on <pb xml:id="page_56" n="49"/>
            <lb/>the same degree of quiet during the opera- <lb/>tion. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The slight irritation which arises from <lb/>keeping up the upper eyelid, and the
            be- <lb/>ginning of the operation in piercing the cor- <lb/>nea, though void of feeling,
            particularly with <lb/>sensitive and irritable patients, often oc- <lb/>casion a sudden
            spasm in the muscles of the <lb/>eye, though the cornea be cut at once, and <lb/>in the
            best manner; yet if the eye be pro- <lb/>minent, with a large moveable pupil, the
            <lb/>crystalline lens, with or without its capsule, <lb/>may suddenly gush out, and
            frequently with <lb/>it a part of the vitreous humour. This case <lb/>often happens, and
            sometimes without de- <lb/>triment to the patient; but there too fre- <lb/>quently
            arises from this an irregularity, a <lb/>prolapsus, and paralysis of the iris, and con-
            <lb/>cretion of the pupil (synizesis), by which <lb/>the whole operation is frustrated. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>This is sufficiently proved by a great va- <lb/>riety of cases, where the best
            skill, of the <lb/>most experienced oculist, was of no avail. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>In such a delicate operation as that <lb/>which has for its object, to restore the
            sight, <pb xml:id="page_57" n="50"/>
            <lb/>nothing dare ultimately be hazarded. It <lb/>remains, therefore, only to state the
            safest <lb/>and most efficacious mode of proceeding, in <lb/>case of the accident
            happening which I have <lb/>just stated. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>I am not, for my own part, of the num- <lb/>ber of oculists who pride themselves on
            the <lb/>mechanical adroitness of performing this <lb/>operation. The credit of
            quickness must not <lb/>be attained by the operator at the price of <lb/>the patient's
            safety. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>some oculists advise in the case of a spasm, <lb/>when the knife is in the eye, or
            the point <lb/>through the anterior chamber, and such <lb/>convulsion should occur, to
            keep the knife <lb/>for a moment steady, and to finish the <lb/>incision slowly. I have
            tried, at diffe- <lb/>rent times, this manner, but always found <lb/>that the
            crystalline lens sprung forwards <lb/>suddenly, and frustrated every precau- <lb/>tion. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Experience proves the success of the ope- <lb/>ration to be the better, the more
            slowly <lb/>the crystalline lens comes forwards, be- <lb/>cause the pupil is the more
            gradually di- <pb xml:id="page_58" n="51"/>
            <lb/>lated; but on the contrary, the quick <lb/>coming forward of the crystalline lens,
            <lb/>by its distending too suddenly, tends to <lb/>lacerate, and to destroy the figure
            of the <lb/>pupil afterwards. In the latter case, the <lb/>pupil loses its motion, and
            changes its fi- <lb/>gure, and the consequence is a proportional <lb/>diminution of the
            sight, (vide Tab. IV. <lb/>Fig. 4.). When I observe, therefore, in this <lb/>operation,
            such an irritation and convulsive <lb/>contraction of the muscles of the eye, which
            <lb/>chiefly manifests itself from the suddenly <lb/>starting and pressing forward of
            the eye, <lb/>an immediate blood-shot appearance in the <lb/>vessels the conjunctiva, an
            advance of the <lb/>crystalline lens and iris towards the cor- <lb/>nea, &amp;c. An
            experienced hand will aslo, <lb/>in a moment, perceive a stronger and clo- <lb/>ser
            pressure against the knife, and combin- <lb/>ing all these circumstances, the operator
            is <lb/>clear of a spasm coming on violently. In <lb/>this case, when I have my knife in
            the eye, <lb/>I push it into the inner corner through <lb/>the cornea, at least more
            than a line out- <lb/>ward, (vide Tab. IV. Fig. 2) and draw <pb xml:id="page_59" n="52"/>
            <lb/>it in the same direction backward out <lb/>of the eye, with the certainty of not
            wound- <lb/>ing the iris. However, being so far ad- <lb/>vanced, it would be easy for me
            to com- <lb/>plete the incision at once; but by drawing <lb/>back the knife, the aqueous
            humour flows <lb/>out: the eye, from that circumstance, be- <lb/>comes collapsed, the
            muscles not moving <lb/>with such strength, it begins to be quieter, <lb/>and comes into
            that state which is desired. <lb/>The pupil is now more dilated, and the
            <lb/>crystalline lens more forward, but by a <lb/>gentle rubbing on the closed eye, and
            <lb/>applying a handkerchief with cold, or a <lb/>little warm water (as the circumstance
            <lb/>requires), the crystalline lens will soon <lb/>recede, and set the iris free. This
            mo- <lb/>ment must be waited for with patience. <lb/>When the patient and his eye are at
            length <lb/>quiet, I order the upper eyelid to be again <lb/>kept up, and take that
            knife, at the point <lb/>of which is a little round blunted button, <lb/>(vide Tab. III.
            Fig. 4.); with this knife I <lb/>re-enter the opening (vide Tab. IV. Fig. 3.) <lb/><hi
              rend="italic">a,</hi> and come out through the anterior cham- <pb xml:id="page_60"
              n="53"/>
            <lb/>ber by <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> in the inner corner, without the <lb/>least injury
            to the iris, and then can (as <lb/>shews the white points by <hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
            finish the inci- <lb/>sion as large as I desire. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>My reasons for using two knives, when <lb/>I could finish the incision with one,
            are, <lb/>that in the first place, I wish the eye to <lb/>be perfectly quiet, the spasm
            mitigated, <lb/>and to prevent the dangerous sudden start- <lb/>ing out of the
            crystalline lens, &amp;c. &amp;c. <lb/>and secondly, I cannot see of what de-
            <lb/>detriment this second knife can be, as hav- <lb/>ing at the point a little round
            button, by <lb/>which it cannot wound or irritate, as it acts <lb/>only on the
            insensible cornea. I never knew <lb/>any great inflammation follow in conse- <lb/>quence
            of this treatment. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Let us now suppose the cornea cut as it <lb/>should be, and large enough for the
            passage <lb/>of the crystalline lens; be not precipitate <lb/>in drawing out the
            crystalline lens, but let <lb/>the eye become again quiet. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The room must, soon after the opening <lb/>of the cornea, be more darkened, to pro-
            <lb/>mote the dilatation of the pupil, and then <pb xml:id="page_61" n="54"/>
            <lb/>try if the crystalline lens, with its capsule, <lb/>will come out by a soft
            pressure; (in this in- <lb/>stance, the operator himself must keep the <lb/>upper eyelid
            up with his finger;) this soft <lb/>pressure is made by the two underlaid fin- <lb/>gers
            alternately, which occasions the crys- <lb/>talline lens to revolve on its axis, and at
            <lb/>length come out of the eye. </p>

            <lb/>But if the operator should perceive that <lb/>the crystalline lens, with its
            capsule, will <lb/>not come near to the pupil, and that the <lb/>latter is not much
            enlarged, let him desist <lb/>in a moment from the attempt, and bring <lb/>the eye again
            into a state of rest; for if he <lb/>should venture to press more strongly, the
            <lb/>vitreous humour would protrude first, leav- <lb/>ing the Cataract with its capsule
            behind. <lb/>This is the worst event which can attend <lb/>the operation: it sometimes
            happens also, <lb/>that by too violent a pressure, the capsule <lb/>is forcibly rent, at
            the moment the Ca- <lb/>taract comes forward. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>Eminent oculists have observed, and <lb/>my own experience has confirmed it, that
            <lb/>if the capsule be forcibly rent in the ope- <pb xml:id="page_62" n="55"/>
            <lb/>ration, the greater part of it becomes <lb/>thereby afterward opaque, and there re-
            <lb/>mains either a weak sight, or very often <lb/>a second blindness (Caracta
            secundaria). <lb/>But, on the contrary, if the capsule be well <lb/>opened, and cut with
            a sharp instrument, <lb/>if a strong inflammation should not occur, <lb/>the capsule
            commonly remains clear and <lb/>transparent. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>But to return to the operation; if the <lb/>eye is again quiet, then let the upper
            eye- <lb/>lid be kept up by the assistant with the ele- <lb/>vator, and let the operator
            proceed to open <lb/>the capsule. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>The opening in the capsule must be <lb/>made as large as possible; it sometimes
            <lb/>happens, that the crystalline lens, while it <lb/>comes through the capsule, leaves
            behind <lb/>an opaque slime, or a broken piece, which <lb/>must be carefully extracted.
            This some- <lb/>times is not done without much difficulty; <lb/>but it seldom happens,
            if the capsule is suffi- <lb/>ciently opened. But if the incision in the cap- <lb/>sule
            is not large enough, it is in vain to at- <pb xml:id="page_63" n="56"/>
            <lb/>tempt the taking out of the opaque part <lb/>remaining. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>A second reason for largely opening the <lb/>capsule is, that if, for any
            particular reason, <lb/>the opaque remainder cannot be extracted, <lb/>you have the
            hope, founded upon repeated <lb/>experience, that the aqueous humour, whilst <lb/>it
            flows in the capsule, will dissolve the <lb/>opaque body. This will be more certain
            <lb/>in proportion to the size of the opening. <lb/>some oculists open the cornea and
            the cap- <lb/>sule at the same time; but in this mode, <lb/>the opening in the latter
            never can be <lb/>large enough. some open it with the cys- <lb/>totom of Lafaye, &amp;c.
            &amp;c. but I make use of <lb/>a double-edged needle, (Tab. III. Fig. 5.) <lb/>of a
            lancet form, in the following manner; <lb/>by the operation of the left eye (make the
            <lb/>flap <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the chair fall over behind, and let <lb/>the head
            of the patient lean a little back; if <lb/>the operator has before been seated, he must
            <lb/>now stand, to have free motion in finishing <lb/>the other part of the operation).
            With my <lb/>right hand I take the spoon of Daviel, and <pb xml:id="page_64" n="57"/>
            <lb/>with it, keep up the wound in the cornea. I <lb/>take in the left hand this needle,
            and keep <lb/>the under eyelid down with the little finger <lb/>of the same hand ; I
            then pass this needle <lb/>through the wound in the cornea into the <lb/>pupil, and open
            the capsule as much as pos- <lb/>sible, and try to cut it in two half circles, <lb/>that
            a whole piece may be taken out from <lb/>the centre. To cut a large piece out of the
            <lb/>capsule, a great degree of dexterity is neces- <lb/>sary to the dilatation of the
            pupil; namely, to <lb/>press with the underlaid little finger, softly, <lb/>the globe of
            the eye, whereby the crystalline <lb/>lens, with its capsule, comes nearer to the
            <lb/>pupil, which dilates; but this, as I have said, <lb/>requires great caution, as the
            capsule is ea- <lb/>sily torn by this pressure, and by the touch <lb/>of the needle, the
            Cataract will be found <lb/>suddenly to come out, which must be avoid- <lb/>ed. If the
            capsule be cut as well as it is <lb/>required, the Cataract now, by the soft
            <lb/>pressure of the underlaid fingers, turns <lb/>about its axis, and falls out of the
            wound in <lb/>the cornea. It is to be observed, that the <pb xml:id="page_65" n="58"/>
            <lb/>lower edge of the crystalline lens turns for- <lb/>ward and upward, and comes into
            the pu- <lb/>pil, before it presses or distends the lower <lb/>part of the iris outward
            in any considerable <lb/>degree, then presses it so forward and down- <lb/>ward, that it
            may be out at the wound in <lb/>the cornea, till at last the lower edge, and <lb/>the
            posterior part of the crystalline lens slips <lb/>down over the lower edge of the pupil,
            and <lb/>out at the wound of the cornea. If the <lb/>operator takes care after this
            extraction to <lb/>keep the eye in a horizontal situation, this <lb/>slow dilatation of
            the pupil is of no detri- <lb/>ment, the pupil will be perfectly round, and <lb/>come
            into its former place. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>In case the Cataract is wholly come out <lb/>of the eye, more light should be
            admitted <lb/>into the room, to observe if the pupil be <lb/>quite clear.—The operator
            must be very <lb/>cautious, and keep his hand over the ope- <lb/>rated eye, and let just
            as much light fall on <lb/>it as he finds by his examination to be ne- <lb/>cessary. He
            should observe most accu- <lb/>rately if any part of the Cataract, or of the <pb
              xml:id="page_66" n="59"/>
            <lb/>humor Morgagnii, or of the capsule, re- <lb/>mains behind opaque; if any should be
            <lb/>found, he must endeavour to bring the first <lb/>out with the spoon of Daviel, and
            the lat- <lb/>ter with a pair of small nippers, or the hook <lb/>(Tab. III. Fig. 6.).
            Those opaque parti- <lb/>cles often remain in the eye undiscovered <lb/>by the strictest
            examination, and make <lb/>their appearance after the wound in the <lb/>cornea is
            closed. They are concealed during <lb/>the operation in the upper part of the cap-
            <lb/>sule, because the pupil is frequently drawn <lb/>down after the operation: it is
            therefore <lb/>the more necessary to examine the pupil by <lb/>different degrees of
            light, that if any thing <lb/>opaque remains behind, it may be discover- <lb/>ed. —In
            this examination the greatest cau- <lb/>tion is requisite, on account of the irri-
            <lb/>tation occasioned by the entrance of the <lb/>light into the tender eye. If the
            pupil be <lb/>quite clear and black, and no portion of the <lb/>iris fallen within the
            wound of the cornea, <lb/>instantly close the eye, and by no means <lb/>try to make any
            experiment, whether the <pb xml:id="page_67" n="60"/>
            <lb/>patient can or cannot see. He can seldom <lb/>see distinctly, on account of the
            extracted <lb/>crystalline lens, the flowing out of the <lb/>aqueous humour, which
            renders the cornea <lb/>wrinkled and flabby. But at all events, it <lb/>is a vain
            glorious essay, which is dangerous <lb/>for the patient's tender eye, which being
            <lb/>accustomed to darkness, is irritated by the <lb/>light. This curiosity seldom goes
            unpu- <lb/>nished. </p>
