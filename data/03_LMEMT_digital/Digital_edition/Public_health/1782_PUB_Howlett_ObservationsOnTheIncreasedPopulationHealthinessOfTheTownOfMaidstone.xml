      <p rend="indent"><lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">M</hi>AIDSTONE is ſituated upon the banks of the river
        <lb/>Medway, nearly in the center of the county of Kent. <lb/>The country around it is
        remarkably fine, highly <lb/>cultivated, and exceedingly rich and fertile; and, from its
        <lb/>continual diverſity of ſurface, affords as great a variety of <lb/>pleaſing views and
        beautiful landſcapes as can well be <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">ceived</w>. The
        ſoil is dry, firm, and rocky, abounds with <lb/>excellent water, nor are there any putrid
        marſhes or ſtagnant <lb/>pools within or without to corrupt its atmoſphere. The air <lb/>is
        therefore pure and ſalubrious; and a lofty ridge of hills <lb/>ſerves as a ſcreen againſt
        the unwholſome vapours and <w part="I">per-</w><lb/><w part="F">nicious</w> blaſts of the
        north and north eaſt. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The population, and of courſe the trade and proſperity, <lb/>of the town
        ſeem to have been greatly advanced, during the <lb/>preſent century. The inhabitants were
        numbered in the <lb/>year 1695, by the Reverend Mr. Innys, with a minuteneſs <lb/>and
        particularity which deſcended to the prefeſſion, ſex, and <lb/>age of each individual; and
        there were at that time, in the <lb/>town and pariſh, 3676 perſons; in March 1781 a very
        <lb/>careful, and, there is reaſon to believe, not inaccurate <lb/>ſurvey again was taken,
        when the number was 5739, <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſequently</w> an increaſe of
        2063 inhabitants in the courſe of <lb/>about 86 years; from a ſtrict and fair examination of
        the <pb xml:id="page_3" n="4"/><lb/>pariſh regiſter, it appears, at leaſt with a ſtrong
        degree of <lb/>probability, that the greater part of this addition of more <lb/>than half
        the original number has been made during the <lb/>laſt go years; the very period when
        ingenious and <w part="I">ſpecu-</w><lb/><w part="F">lative</w> men have believed and
        aſſerted that the <w part="I">depopula-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w> of Great Britain has
        been uncommonly rapid, and <lb/>that we have as it were been ſinking faſt into abſolute
        <lb/>annihilation. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Before we proceed to our intended obſervations, it may <lb/>not be amiſs
        to illuſtrate the advantages to be derived from <lb/>accurate regiſters of mortality in the
        words of Dr. Percival. <lb/>"The eſtabliſhment of a judicious and accurate regiſter of
        <lb/>births and burials, in every town and pariſh, would be <w part="I">attend-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">ed</w> with the moſt important advantages, medical, political, <lb/>and moral. By
        ſuch an inſtitution, the increaſe or decreaſe <lb/>of certain diſeaſes; the comparative
        healthineſs of different <lb/>ſituations, climates and ſeaſons; the influence of particular
        <lb/>trades and manufactures on longevity; with many other <w part="I">cu-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">rious</w> circumſtances, not more intereſting to phyſicians, than <lb/>beneficial
        to mankind, would be aſcertained with tolerable <lb/>preciſion. In a political view, exact
        regiſters of human <lb/>mortality are of ſtill greater conſequence, as the number of
        <lb/>people, and progreſs of population in the kingdom, may in <lb/>the moſt eaſy and
        unexceptionable manner be deduced from <lb/>them. They are the foundation likewiſe of all
        calculations <lb/>concerning the values of aſſurances on lives, reverſionary <lb/>payments,
        and of every ſcheme for providing annuities for <lb/>widows and perſons in old age; in a
        moral light alſo ſuch <lb/><hi rend="italic">Tables</hi> are of evident utility, as the
        increaſe of vice or virtue <lb/>may be determined, by obſerving the proportion which the
        <lb/>diſeaſes ariſing from luxury, intemperance, and other ſimilar <lb/>cauſes bear to the
        reſt; and in what particular places <w part="I">diſ-</w><pb xml:id="page_4" n="5"/><lb/><w
          part="F">tempers</w> of this claſs are found to be moſt fatal." Percival's <lb/>eſſays,
        vol. 2d. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The pariſh regiſters of this kingdom, indeed, have not <lb/>generally
        been kept with that degree of minute and accurate <lb/>diſcrimination neceſſary for all the
        uſeful and curious <w part="I">deduc-</w><lb/><w part="F">tions</w> here ſuggeſted, nor can
        it be pretended that that of <lb/>Maidſtone in particular has. It appears, however, that the
        <lb/>inſertion of baptiſms, marriages, and burials in it, after the <lb/>common and ordinary
        way, has been always ſo extremely <lb/>regular as to afford, in conjunction with actual
        ſurveys at <lb/>different periods, much pleaſing and ſatisfactory information. <lb/>Nay it
        may be truly added, that during the laſt 20 or 30 <lb/>years, it has ſome peculiar
        recommendation, which will be <lb/>apparent from the tables ſubjoined. Should the matter <w
          part="I">en-</w><lb/><w part="F">gage</w> the attention of the medical gentlemen of the
        town <lb/>(who are certainly beſt able to aſſiſt and direct in an <w part="I"
          >under-</w><lb/><w part="F">taking</w> of this kind) it will probably for the future have
        <lb/>every requiſite diſtinction, and be annually publiſhed as <lb/>regular bills of
        mortality. The cities of Norwich and <lb/>Carliſle, the towns of Northampton, Eccles, and
        ſome others <lb/>have ſet the example. Maidſtone need not be aſhamed to <lb/>follow; as it
        will appear, that, in ſome reſpects, ſhe is little <lb/>inferior to <hi rend="italic"
          >any,</hi> and greatly ſuperior to <hi rend="italic">moſt</hi> of them. In <lb/>the mean
        time, and till the regiſter acquires this deſirable <lb/>perfection, we will make the beſt
        uſe we can of it, in its <lb/>preſent ſtate. </p>

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The ſlighteſt inſpection of this table ſuggeſts many <lb/>curious
        concluſions. The firſt 30 years, that is, during the <lb/>reigns of James the 2d, of William
        the 3d, and of queen <lb/>Ann, we obſerve that both the baptiſms and burials, and of
        <lb/>courſe the number of people were conſiderably diminiſhed; <lb/>notwithſtanding that the
        thread manufacture, which is now <lb/>dwindled to almoſt nothing, was then in its moſt
        flouriſhing <lb/>ſtate. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>From this aera quite through the reign of George the 1ſt, <lb/>and to
        the latter end of George the 2d, the baptiſms were <lb/>continually increaſing. The burials
        however advanced in a <lb/>much greater proportion, and at intervals with ſingular <hi
          rend="italic">ine-<lb/>quality,</hi> inſomuch that in the 10 years, beginning with 1732
        <lb/>they were the more numerous by above 200, or almoſt one <lb/>6th of the whole. We
        cannot therefore certainly conclude <lb/>that the inhabitants were much augmented, but only
        that the <lb/>mortality of the town, from whatever cauſe, was greatly <w part="I"
          >in-</w><lb/><w part="F">creaſed</w>. From that time to the preſent, the baptiſms have
        <lb/>been almoſt continually gaining on the burials, till in the 10 <lb/>years, now
        immediately paſt, they have got nearly 200 <w part="I">be-</w><lb/><w part="F">fore</w>
        them, which probably indicates the double advantage <lb/>of multiplied numbers and
        diminiſhed unhealthineſs. Upon <lb/>caſting an eye over the <hi rend="italic">annual</hi>
        liſts of burials we ſee, that, <w part="I">be-</w><lb/><w part="F">fore</w> the modern
        improved practice of inoculation was <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">troduced</w> every
        5 or 6 years the average number was almoſt <lb/>conſtantly doubled; and it is found upon
        enquiry, that at <lb/>ſuch intervals nearly the ſmall pox uſed to repeat its dreadful
        <lb/>periodical viſits. The numbers which died of this diſtemper <lb/>were not particularly
        noticed in the regiſter till the year 1753; <lb/>when they amounted to 70 perſons out of the
        209 that <lb/>died in that year, and 102 out of 223 in 1760, and 54 out <lb/>of 181 in 1766. </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_7" n="8"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Prior to theſe inſtances it broke out in the year 1734, and twice more
        in the courſe of about 11 years immediately <w part="I">ſub-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſequent</w>
        to that; at each of which times it raged with greater <lb/>violence and made much more
        terrible havock than in either <lb/>of the periods above-mentioned; we may therefore very
        <lb/>fairly conclude that in the ſhort ſpace of 30 years it deprived <lb/>the town of
        between 5 and 600 of its inhabitants; whereas <lb/>in the 15 or 16 years that have elapſed
        ſince the general <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">oculation</w> it has occaſioned the
        death of only about 60. <lb/>Ample and ſatisfactory evidence of the vaſt benefit the town
        <lb/>has received from this ſalutary invention! And it appears, <lb/>with a high degree of
        probability, upon proofs ſimilar to the <lb/>above, that, from the ſame cauſes, in the
        kingdom at large <lb/>not leſs than 4 or 500,000 lives were loſt in the former of the
        <lb/>periods now ſtated, and that nearly half that number has <lb/>been ſaved in the latter. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>In the year 1695 the inhabitants were only, as before <lb/>obſerved,
        3676; the annual burials on an average of 10 years <lb/>immediately preceding were 147; and
        the annual mortality <lb/>1 in 25 of the whole population. In 1781 the people were
        <lb/>5739; the annual burials, upon an average of the ſame <w part="I">num-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">ber</w> of years, taken in the ſame relation, only 152, and the

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>From a view of table I. we ſee that the number of <w part="I"

          >conſider-</w><lb/><w part="F">ably</w> leſs than the 10 years immediately preceding. Now
        <lb/>this was the very period in which the <hi rend="italic">marriage act</hi> took
        <lb/>place, and this decreaſe of weddings may at firſt ſight ſuggeſt <lb/>a concluſion
        greatly to its diſadvantage; and induce one to <lb/>ſuppoſe that it has operated as a
        powerful reſtraint upon <lb/>matrimony; but nothing can be more fallacious than ſuch <lb/>a
        ſuppoſition. The marriage act has doubtleſs promoted <lb/>regularity and order, has
        ſometimes reſtrained folly and <lb/>prevented miſery; but ſcarcely a ſhadow of evidence has
        <lb/>yet been produced, that it has at all obſtructed judicious <w part="I">con-</w><pb
          xml:id="page_12" n="13"/><lb/><w part="F">nections</w>, encouraged illicit intercourſe, or
        diminiſhed legal <lb/>population. The diminution of marriages in the inſtance <lb/>before
        us, evidently aroſe from hence. A ſurrogate <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſtantly</w>
        reſided in the town. Before the marriage act he <lb/>had often no doubt influence ſufficient
        to engage the parties <lb/>to whom he granted a licence, to grant <hi rend="italic">him</hi>
        in return the <lb/>privilege of marrying them. But this was afterwards <w part="I"
          >effec-</w><lb/><w part="F">tually</w> prevented by their being obliged to have the <w
          part="I">ſolem-</w><lb/><w part="F">nity</w> performed in the pariſh to which one of them
        belonged; <lb/>hence the ſurrogate miſſed the additional advantage of the <lb/>marriage ſee,
        and the weddings in the town were <w part="I">immedi-</w><lb/><w part="F">ately</w>
        diminiſhed but unqueſtionably they are to be found in <lb/>the regiſters of the neighbouring
        pariſhes. For taking a vaſt <lb/>number and variety of pariſhes of every ſize, ſituation,
        and <lb/>deſcription, it appears that the aggregate proportion of <lb/>marriages and burials
        has been conſiderably greater ſince <lb/>the marriage act took place than before; which if

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>We here ſee that the ratio of marriages to baptiſms and <lb/>burials
        jointly, in the former period, was about as 1 to 6 ¼; <lb/>in the latter nearly as 1 to 5 ⅘;
        of marriages to baptiſms <lb/>alone, in the former period, as 1 to 3 20/105; in the latter,
        as <lb/>1 to 3 10/100; of marriages to burials alone, in the former <w part="I"
          >pe-</w><lb/><w part="F">riod</w>, as 1 to 3 <unclear>#</unclear>7/100; in the latter, as
        1 to 2 7<unclear>#</unclear>/100. The faireſt <lb/>concluſion from this, is, that the wiſe
        and judicious <w part="I">regula-</w><lb/><w part="F">tions</w> of the above-mentioned act
        have greatly increaſed the <lb/>number and proportion of marriages by rendering it more
        <lb/>difficult for any perſons to enjoy the <hi rend="italic">reputation</hi> of matrimony
        <lb/>without being really and actually married. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>A very ſtriking circumſtance offers itſelf in the regiſter of
        <lb/>burials. By the ſurvey of 1781 it appears that the number <lb/>of males was 417 fewer
        than the females, and yet on an <w part="I">ave-</w><lb/><w part="F">rage</w> of the laſt 10
        years, the male burials were annually <lb/>about 8 more than the female; and it will be
        found upon <lb/>making the requiſite computations that only 1 in more than <lb/>40 have
        annually died of the females, and almoſt 1 in 32 of <lb/>the males;and the ſame proportion
        has probably held <w part="I">through-</w><lb/><w part="F">out</w> the 100 years, as the
        total of male deaths are to the female <lb/>nearly as 14 to 13. What can this prodigious
        difference be <lb/>owing to? Some allowance is doubtleſs to be made for the <lb/>great
        number of female ſervants who come principally from <lb/>the country, at perhaps the moſt
        healthy period of human <lb/>life, and who by the late ſurvey alone amounted to 375 of
        <lb/>the 417 by which the females exceed the males. But this <lb/>circumſtance will not
        account for the 5th part of the <w part="I">diſ-</w><lb/><w part="F">proportion</w> before
        us. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Both French and Engliſh philoſophers ſeem to concur in <lb/>opinion that
        women are naturally longer lived than men. <lb/>But it may perhaps be doubted whether this
        be founded <lb/>upon evidence ſufficiently various and extenſive. From <pb xml:id="page_15"
          n="16"/><lb/>mere analogical reaſoning juſt the contrary might be <w part="I"
          >con-</w><lb/><w part="F">cluded</w>. Men are a greater number of years in coming to
        <lb/>their full perfection, both in body and mind; and it is a <w part="I">gene-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">ral</w> law of nature, that by how much longer any animal or <lb/>vegetable is in
        growing, by ſo much the longer it is in <w part="I">de-</w><lb/><w part="F">caying</w>. Men
        are alſo of a conſtitution more firm and robuſt; <lb/>nor are they liable to an equal number
        and variety of diſeaſes: <lb/>On every account therefore they appear fitted for a more
        <lb/>extended duration; and agreeable to this obvious inference, <lb/>it is a wellknown and
        generally acknowledged fact, that <hi rend="italic">ſome</hi>
        <lb/>men <hi rend="italic">have</hi> lived to a greater age than even <hi rend="italic"
          >any</hi> women have <lb/>done. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The very ingenious Dr. Heyſham of Carliſle has remark'd <lb/>"that the
        conſtitutions of males are fitted for laborious <w part="I">ex-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >ertions</w>, and that their muſcular and nervous fibres may <lb/>therefore be ſuppoſed to
        become ſtiff, rigid, and incapable <lb/>of performing the functions neceſſary to health and
        life ſooner <lb/>than thoſe of females, both on account of their original <w part="I"
          >tex-</w><lb/><w part="F">ture</w> and the friction which muſt neceſſarily occur from <w
          part="I">la-</w><lb/><w part="F">borious</w> exerciſe." But this reaſoning, however
        plauſible, <lb/>cannot perhaps be admitted; becauſe in country pariſhes, <lb/>where the
        laborious exertions of the men are beyond <w part="I">com-</w><lb/><w part="F">pariſon</w>
        the greateſt, the difference reſpecting the mortality <lb/>we are ſpeaking of is vaſtly the
        leaſt; and ſome times <w part="I">like-</w><lb/><w part="F">wiſe</w> much in ſavour of the
        male inhabitants; as is eminently <lb/>the caſe in the pariſh of Brightling, in Suſſex; and
        many <lb/>other inſtances ſimilar to it might eaſily be produced. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Men, it is true, are ſometimes expoſed to greater dangers <lb/>and more
        numerous hardſhips than women; yet excepting <lb/>ſoldiers, failors, fiſhermen, colliers,
        and miners, and <w part="I">proba-</w><lb/><w part="F">bly</w> a few manufacturers, this
        circumſtance has a very <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">fined</w> and trivial
        operation. </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_16" n="17"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>There is one cauſe ſtill behind univerſally allowed to <lb/>operate, and
        which alone perhaps is funy adequate to the <lb/>effect. Men are in general eſpecially in
        large and <w part="I">popu-</w><lb/><w part="F">lous</w> towns, more intemperate than women,
        both in eating <lb/>and drinking, and are likewiſe more commonly chargeable <lb/>with every
        other irregularly and licentiouſneſs of conduct. <lb/>To theſe therefore may their greater

        two periods of 20 years each, the firſt beginning <lb/>with year 1682, the ſecond with 1761;
        and it is wonderful <lb/>to obſerve the perfect correſpondence, not only between the

        That ſeaſon which is moſt <lb/>fatal to human life in one period is exactly ſo in the other.
        <lb/>In this melancholy pre-eminence winter takes the lead, <w part="I">au-</w><lb/><w

        phyſician perhaps might deduce from hence <lb/>many curious, uſeſeful, and important
        concluſions; but the <lb/>moſt ſuperficial inſpector cannot but remark that the great
        <lb/>diſadvantage of our ſituation ſeems a deficiency of heat. <lb/>For beſides the

        months immediately <lb/>contiguous to each other, the months of December and <w part="I"
          >Ja-</w><lb/><w part="F">nuary</w> in each period have the moſt numerous deaths; July

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>With regard to the great increaſe of population above <lb/>demonſtrated,
        we need not indulge the gloomy idea that it <lb/>has ariſen from the depopulation of the
        country around. <lb/>On the contrary, very few pariſhes excepted, it has multiplied <lb/>its
        people in full proportion. The increaſe of the one has <lb/>perhaps been at once the cauſe
        and the conſequence of the <lb/>increaſe of the other. Allowing for extraordinary caſes,
        <lb/>where ever you have a large and flouriſhing town, you will <lb/>ſoon have a well

          part="F">ſure</w> and with the exception of a few particulars has been <lb/>the caſe with
        Maidſtone and its vicinity for the laſt 20 or 30 <lb/>years; but it has been ſo in the
        fulleſt and ampleſt degree with <lb/>reſpect to more than half the kingdom; and it may be
        <lb/>ſafely affirmed upon ſatisfactory evidence, that <w part="I">notwithſtand-</w><lb/><w

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>It muſt here be obſerved, that in the ſurvey of 1781, were
        <lb/>comprehended the women and children belonging to 4 or 500 <lb/>ſoldiers then quartered
        in the town, together with all other <lb/>tranſient and temporary lodgers. Of the former of
        theſe <w part="I">deno-</w><lb/><w part="F">minations</w> we have now not any, and the
        latter are entirely <w part="I">un-</w><lb/><w part="F">noticed</w>. It may alſo be
        remarked, that the time of the year at <lb/>which this latter enumeration has been
        performed, is rather <lb/>unfavourable for our numbers appearing to advantage; as ſome
        <lb/>of our people are doubtleſs abſent in different parts of the <w part="I"
          >cir-</w><lb/><w part="F">cumjacent</w> country, upon harveſt-work and other labours of
        the <lb/>ſeaſon; a few we have unqueſtionably furniſhed to the public <lb/>ſervice of the
        kingdom, both in the army and navy; and the <pb xml:id="page_21" n="22"/><lb/>peculiar
        unhealthineſs of the laſt winter and ſpring, as well as <lb/>the general hardſhip and
        preſſure of the times muſt each have <lb/>ſomewhat checked our growth. Yet, notwithſtanding
        all theſe <lb/>diſadvantages, our inhabitants now amount to 5755, which is 16 <lb/>more than
        they were in March 1781; and after due attention <lb/>to the ſeveral conſiderations now
        ſuggeſted, our actual <w part="I">perma-</w><lb/><w part="F">nent</w> population can
        ſcarcely have been leſs augmented during <lb/>the laſt 18 months, than 100 perſons. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>To the evidence already adduced, in proof of the <w part="I"
          >extraordi-</w><lb/><w part="F">nary</w> healthineſs of the town, may be added, from the
        preſent <lb/>ſurvey, the high proportion of children under 15 and of men and <lb/>women
        above 70 years of age, as no unequivocal teſtimony of <lb/>the ſame pleaſing fact. In the
        city of Cheſter, the ſalubrity of <lb/>which has with juſtice been conſidered as very highly
          <w part="I">diſtin-</w><lb/><w part="F">guiſhed</w>, the number of perſons in the year
        1774 above 70, was <lb/>about 1 in 23½ of the total population; in Carliſle in the year
        <lb/>1779, in 29⅓; whereas in Maidſtone it is ſo high as nearly 1 in <lb/>20⅚. Again, the
        ratio of children under 15 in the city of Cheſter <lb/>at the above-mentioned period, to the
        total number of <w part="I">inhabi-</w><lb/><w part="F">tants</w>, was about 1 to
          3<unclear>#</unclear>; in Maidſtone it is more than 1 to 3<unclear>#</unclear>; <lb/>a
        ſuperiority, it may fairly be preſumed, which the diminution <lb/>of the number between 15
        and 70, from the peculiar <w part="I">circum-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſtances</w> of the times,
        can by no means deprive us of. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The number of reputed diſſenters from the church of <w part="I"
