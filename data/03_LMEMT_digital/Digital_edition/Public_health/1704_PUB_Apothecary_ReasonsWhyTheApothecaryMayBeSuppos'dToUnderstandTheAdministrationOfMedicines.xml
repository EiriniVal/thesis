      <p rend="indent"><lb/><hi rend="dc(4)">Y</hi>OU have at length found <lb/>the moſt effectual
        means <lb/>to prevail with me, to <lb/>break thro' the reſolution I had <lb/>taken, of
        having no ſhare in the <lb/>preſent Controverſie between the <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Phyſicians</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Apothecarys,</hi> by <lb/>imputing my Silence
        to the <w part="I">bad-</w><lb/><w part="F">ness</w> of my Cauſe: In the <w part="I"
          >Vindi-</w><lb/><w part="F">cation</w> of which, you are pleas'd <pb xml:id="page_3" n="4"
        /><lb/>to ſay, no Sober or Ingenious <w part="I">Per-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſon</w> will offer
        to draw his Pen. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>I muſt confeſs, I have hitherto <lb/>been of the Opinion of the Major
        <lb/>part of our Profeſſion; that what <lb/>has yet appear'd in publick againſt <lb/>us, has
        not deſerv'd a ſerious <w part="I">An-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſwer</w>, moſt of it being taken
        up <lb/>on Prejudice, the reſt a Scandalous <lb/>Aſperſion, invented by a peeviſh <lb/>Set
        of Men, who were angry <lb/>that any body thriv'd beſide <w part="I">them-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">ſelves</w>. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Thus then have you <w part="I">unwilling-</w><lb/><w part="F">ly</w>
        forced me into a ſpacious Field, <lb/>where on each ſide I may extend <lb/>and dilate my
        ſelf; and which <lb/>way ſoever I turn, may find at <lb/>leaſt <hi rend="italic">quantum
          ſufficit</hi> of Matter to <lb/>Work upon. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>But ſince you keep a more than <lb/>ordinary pother with the high <w
          part="I">Ad-</w><lb/><w part="F">vantages</w> which the <hi rend="italic">Phyſicians</hi>
        have <pb xml:id="page_4" n="5"/><lb/>over us, I ſhall chuſe to examine <lb/>the truth of
        that Aſſertion, and <w part="I">en-</w><lb/><w part="F">deavour</w> to ſet thoſe High <w
          part="I">Advan-</w><lb/><w part="F">tages</w>, (as you call 'em) in a true <lb/>light; and
        then leave the <w part="I">Impar-</w><lb/><w part="F">tial</w> World to Judge, whether all
        be <lb/>Goſpel which proceeds from <lb/>the Pen of a Diſpenſary <hi rend="italic"
          >Phyſician.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>And firſt it is pretended, That <lb/>the <hi rend="italic"
          >Phſician,</hi> by his liberal <w part="I">Educa-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w>, (that is,
        by being bred at <lb/>an <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi>) has greater and more <lb/>frequent
        opportunities of being <lb/>inſtructed in the Practice of <hi rend="italic"
          >Phy-<lb/>ſick,</hi> than the <hi rend="italic">Apothecary</hi> can have; <lb/>and that
        not only from his own <lb/>private Reading and Obſervation, <lb/>the Care and Direction of
        his <lb/>Tutor, but alſo from the publick <lb/>Lectures of the Phyſick Profeſſor. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Now if it be expected that this <lb/>Argument ſhould have any force
        <lb/>againſt us, it muſt firſt be prov'd <pb xml:id="page_5" n="6"/><lb/>what extraordinary
        Benefits thoſe <lb/>are which Young Students receive <lb/>from Tutors and Phyſick <w
          part="I">Pro-</w><lb/><w part="F">feſſors</w>; and not think that we <lb/>ſhall barely
        aſſent to them, or <w part="I">be-</w><lb/><w part="F">lieve</w> them to be ſuch mighty
        <lb/>things upon their ſingle <w part="I">Affirma-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w>. I fear when
        theſe <w part="I">wonder-</w><lb/><w part="F">ful</w> Lectures come to be examin'd,
        <lb/>they will appear little better than <lb/>Barren Animadverſions on <hi rend="italic"
          >Galen, <lb/>Hippocrates,</hi> or ſome other of the <lb/>old Phyſical Authours; which <w
          part="I">e-</w><lb/><w part="F">very</w> Man is capable of doing, who <lb/>is able to read
        and underſtand <lb/>them. And I believe we may <w part="I">ven-</w><lb/><w part="F">ture</w>
        to add, that the Auditors of <lb/>theſe Lectures generally return <lb/>with the ſame degree
        of <w part="I">Know-</w><lb/><w part="F">ledge</w> and Satisfaction, as a late <lb/>Aſſembly
        did from a Lecture at <lb/><hi rend="italic">Exeter-Exchange,</hi> againſt the <hi
          rend="italic">Cir-<lb/>culation of the Blood.</hi>
      </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_6" n="7"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>It is again Objected againſt us, <lb/>That the Opportunities of being
        <lb/>Advanc'd in the Knowledge of <lb/><hi rend="italic">Anatomy</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
          >Chymiſtry,</hi> ſo eſſential <lb/>to the Qualification of a Perſon <lb/>who is to
        Adminiſter Phyſick, are <lb/>greater in the <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi> than in any
        <lb/>other place; and from whence the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Apothecary</hi> is totally

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>It muſt be allow'd, that the <w part="I">un-</w><lb/><w part="F"

          part="I">undoubted-</w><lb/><w part="F">ly</w> the Perſon who Adminiſters <lb/>Phyſick
        ought to be acquainted <lb/>withal. From which <w part="I">notwith-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >ſtanding</w>, I cannot ſee how the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Apothecary</hi> is totally
        excluded, ſince <lb/>there are conſtant Anatomical <w part="I">Diſ-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >ſections</w> at the <hi rend="italic">Surgeon</hi>'s <hi rend="italic">Hall,</hi> which

        <lb/>meets withal in ſix at his <hi rend="italic">Acade-<lb/>my.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The pretended Advantages they <lb/>have over us in <hi rend="italic"

        Confutation of that <lb/>groundleſs Aſſertion. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Theſe, <hi rend="italic">Sir,</hi> Being the principal <lb/>Reaſons on
        which You build <lb/>your <hi rend="italic">Hypotheſis,</hi> namely, the <w part="I"
          >Ad-</w><lb/><w part="F">vantages</w> which the <hi rend="italic">Phyſician</hi> has
        <lb/>over the <hi rend="italic">Apothecary,</hi> I ſhall not <lb/>content my ſelf with this
        general <lb/>Reflection on them, but ſhall <w part="I">pro-</w><lb/><w part="F">ceed</w> to
        examine them more cloſely, <pb xml:id="page_8" n="9"/><lb/>and particularly that of <w
          part="I">Study-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> at the <hi rend="italic">Univerſity,</hi> by
        which is <lb/>meant a liberal Education, as if <lb/>the Streams of Polite Literature
        <lb/>and Knowledge were not alike <lb/>diffus'd throughout the <hi rend="italic">Globe,</hi>
        but <lb/>were ſcantily confin'd to the Banks <lb/>of <hi rend="italic">Cham</hi> or <hi
          rend="italic">Iſis.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>We will ſuppoſe then, An <hi rend="italic">Apo-<lb/>thecary,</hi> who is
        Maſter of the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> Tongues,
        (as <lb/>there are few of them but are) to <lb/>be as duly Qualified for the <w part="I"
          >Read-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w>, Comparing and <w part="I">Animadver-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">ting</w> on <hi rend="italic">Phyſical</hi> Authours, as the <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Academic Phyſician,</hi> which I think <lb/>no ſober Intelligent Perſon will
        <lb/>deny, if he allows that the <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi>
        <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> Tongues as Taught at <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Weſtminſter, Pauls,</hi> &amp;c. to be as fit <lb/>for that purpoſe, as what the

          rend="italic">Oxford,</hi> &amp;c. </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_9" n="10"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Neither will it be diſputed with <lb/>me, I think, that Reading, <w
          part="I">Reffe-</w><lb/><w part="F">ction</w>, Obſervation and <w part="I"
          >Experi-</w><lb/><w part="F">ment</w>, are the only known means <lb/>of acquiring Humane
        Learning <lb/>and Science: To all which, the <hi rend="italic">A-<lb/>pothecary</hi> thus
        Qualified, has as fair <lb/>pretences as the moſt Elevated <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Phyſician</hi> of 'em all; and <w part="I">where-</w><lb/><w part="F">in</w> the <hi
          rend="italic">Apothecary</hi> may as <w part="I">reaſona-</w><lb/><w part="F">bly</w> be
        thought to make as great a <lb/>Proficience, provided he uſes the <lb/>ſame Induſtry and
        Application. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>It may be objected, That altho' <lb/>the <hi rend="italic"
          >Apothecary</hi> be thus Qualified, <lb/>yet whilſt he is an Apprentice he <lb/>has little
        or no time for theſe <w part="I">Stu-</w><lb/><w part="F">dys</w>, if he had never ſo great
        an <lb/>Inclination; that what with the <lb/>Duty to his Maſter, and the <w part="I"
          >com-</w><lb/><w part="F">mon</w> Neceſſities and Expence of <lb/>Life, which ask ſome
        time to be <lb/>repair'd in ſpight of us, there will <pb xml:id="page_10" n="11"/><lb/>be
        little or none left for any thing elſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>To this I Anſwer, That altho' <lb/>for the firſt Year or two there may
        <lb/>be little elſe done, yet by that time <lb/>he begins to have a true Taſt of <lb/>the
        Matter, and his Reaſon ſhines <lb/>forth with brighter Rays: If he <lb/>be a Youth of any
        Spirit and <w part="I">E-</w><lb/><w part="F">mulation</w>, he will and do's find a
        <lb/>thouſand opportunities of <w part="I">advan-</w><lb/><w part="F">cing</w> his
        Knowledge, equal, if not <lb/>ſuperiour to the <hi rend="italic">Academic <w part="I"
            >Phyſi-</w><lb/><w part="F">cian</w>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Apothecary</hi> then thus <w part="I"
          >Qua-</w><lb/><w part="F">lified</w>, may very reaſonably be <lb/>thought to underſtand
        the Study <lb/>of Phyſick, the Natures of <w part="I">Diſ-</w><lb/><w part="F">eaſes</w> and
        their Cures, equally with <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Phyſician,</hi> tho' he cannot boaſt
        <lb/>the High Advantages of a liberal <lb/>Education and <hi rend="italic">Accademic</hi>
        <w part="I">Accom-</w><lb/><w part="F">pliſhments</w>. </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_11" n="12"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Whilſt the <hi rend="italic">Phyſician</hi> contends <lb/>with us after
        this manner, we ſhall <lb/>never recede from theſe Principles: <lb/>But if he ſhall ſay,
        That the <w part="I">Advan-</w><lb/><w part="F">tages</w> of an <hi rend="italic"
          >Academic</hi> Education <lb/>are a better Foundation for him to <lb/>Set up for a Wit, a

        ſubmit, frankly <w part="I">acknowledg-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> that we induſtriouſly

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The World is very ſenſible what <lb/>Advantages they owe to theſe <w

        <lb/>It may be thought perhaps, that <lb/>here I have a little Tranſgreſs'd, <lb/>and gone

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Since then the <hi rend="italic">Apothecary</hi> is not <lb/>obliged to

        <lb/>to miſlead us into thoſe Errours <lb/>we have been guilty of, in relation <lb/>to
