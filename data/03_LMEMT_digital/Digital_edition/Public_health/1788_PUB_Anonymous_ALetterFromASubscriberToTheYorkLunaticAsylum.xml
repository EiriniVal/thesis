          <lb/><hi rend="size(2.0)">H</hi>AVING for ſome year paſt paid a particular at-
          <lb/>tention to the Government of the York Lunatic Aſylum, <lb/>I flatter myſelf that, in
          the detail of this Letter, I ſhall <lb/>be able to lay before you ſome particulars worthy
          of <lb/>your notice: and I the more readily embrace this op- <lb/>portunity, as I find
          that the Reverend Mr. Maſon has <lb/>lately publiſhed ſome <q rend="quotes">Animadverſions
          </q> on the Cha- <lb/>rity, which appear to me deficient in information, and
          <lb/>fallacious in argument. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>From the time that the Aſylum was opened in 1777, <lb/>to the middle of the year
          1788, the houſe has received, <lb/>as I am well informed, all the patients that have
          offered, <lb/>without rejecting one application for want of room. <lb/>But for ſome months
          paſt the applications have been ſo <lb/>numerous, that the apothecary has been under the
          <lb/>neceſſity of putting up two beds in many of the rooms, <lb/>contrary to the uſage of
          the houſe, and the convenience <lb/>of the patients. This inconvenience, however, will
          <lb/>ſoon be removed, as the new building, containing <lb/>twenty-four rooms, will be
          ready for the reception of <lb/>patients before the expiration of the preſent year. </p>
        <pb n="8"/>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>At this time the Aſylum contains ſixty-ſix patients, <lb/>and theſe are formed into
          three diviſions. The firſt <lb/>diviſion (in number twenty, and never to exceed
          <lb/>twenty-five), conſiſts of ſuch patients as are of better <lb/>condition, who pay a
          conſiderable weekly ſum for their <lb/>board and medicines, the ſurplus of which is
          employed <lb/>in leſſening the payments of thoſe patients who are in <lb/>low
          circumſtances, and have no pariſh relief. The ſe- <lb/>cond diviſion (in number
          twenty-ſix, of which upwards <lb/>of one fourth are pariſh-paupers), conſiſts of thoſe who
          <lb/>pay eight ſhillings per week for their board and medicines; <lb/>a ſum which from
          experience is found equal to the ex- <lb/>pence incurred by patients in general. In this
          diviſion <lb/>the Governors have included the pariſh-paupers, judge- <lb/>ing it
          unreaſonable that pariſhes ſhould ſhare with the <lb/>neceſſitous objects of the third
          diviſion all the advanta- <lb/>ges ariſing from the ſurplus of the payments made by
          <lb/>the patients in affluent circumſtances. It ſurely is ſuf- <lb/>ficient that
          pariſh-paupers are taken in at a price equal <lb/>to what they coſt in diet and medicines.
            <hi rend="italic">This</hi> was the <lb/>relief originally intended, and with which the
          pariſhes, <lb/>for the ſpace of four years, were well contented; but <lb/>as ſoon as the
          Governors reduced the weekly payments <lb/>of thoſe who were in low circumſtances, then
          the pariſhes, <lb/>moſt unjuſtly and ungenerouſly, put in their plea for a <lb/>reduction
          alſo, not conſidering that there was a wide <lb/>difference between a body of affluent
          people and a poor <lb/>individual. To ſay that pariſhes will refuſe to ſend <lb/>their
          inſane poor to a place where they have a chance <lb/>to be cured, or relieved, <hi
            rend="italic">becauſe</hi> they muſt there pay <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">equitable</hi>
          expence of their board, is a childiſh idea, <lb/>and contrary to experience. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>The third diviſion (in number twenty) conſiſts of <lb/>patients in low circumſtances
          who pay for their own <lb/>board, and have no aſſiſtance from their pariſhes. Thoſe,
          <lb/>as I am well informed, are all objects of pitiable di- <lb/>ſtreſs. They ſtand thus:
          Ten at ſix ſhillings; Six at <lb/>five ſhillings; and Four at four ſhillings per week. Of
            <pb n="9"/>
          <lb/>theſe laſt, one is the ſon of an aged widow, whoſe in- <lb/>come is barely ſufficient
          for herſelf; another is the huſ- <lb/>band of an induſtrious woman, who ſupports herſelf
          and <lb/>one child by the profits of a ſmall ſhop; the third is the <lb/>ſon of a
          day-labourer, who rents a ſmall cottage and two <lb/>acres of land; and the fourth is the
          wife of a poor curate, <lb/>who has ſix children: And is the pecuniary diſtreſs of <lb/>a
          whole pariſh to be put in competition with that of one <lb/>ſuch poor perſon! On this
          diviſion of diſtreſſed individuals <lb/>the Governors have beſtowed the intereſt of L.
          650, given <lb/>by Lady Gower, Mrs. Bourchier, and Mrs. Bouverie, ex- <lb/>preſsly for <q
            rend="quotes">the relief of the moſt neceſſitous objects; </q>
          <lb/>and they have alſo applied to their uſe part of the over- <lb/>flowings of the firſt
          diviſion, as before obſerved. With- <lb/>out theſe aids, the poor objects of this diviſion
          could not <lb/>have ſubſiſted in the Aſylum, it being well known that no <lb/>part of the
          general ſubſcription can be applied to the <lb/><hi rend="italic">maintenance</hi> of the
          patients, until the ſtock is found to ex- <lb/>ceed the expence of the buildings, repairs,
          and furniture. <lb/>To this the Governors have ſcrupulouſly adhered, inſo- <lb/>much, that
          from the commencement of the Charity in 1777. <lb/>to the preſent hour, no part of the
          ſubſcribed money has <lb/>been appropriated to the maintenance of the patients. <lb/>On
          the contrary, the patients by weekly payments, pro- <lb/>portioned to their abilities,
          have defrayed the whole ex- <lb/>pence of the houſehold, and at the ſame time diſcharged
          <lb/>the wages of the ſervants and the ſalary of the apothe- <lb/>cary, amounting in the
          laſt year to the ſum of L. 1200. <lb/>Some perſons have ſaid that they ſubſcribed their
          <lb/>money for the maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">pariſh</hi>-poor, as well <lb/>as
          for the erection and furniſhing of the building; but <lb/>theſe perſons ſeem to have
          miſconceived the deſign of <lb/>the original founders. All the acts of the committee
          <lb/>ſhew, that the <hi rend="italic">maintenance</hi> of the patients from a pub-
          <lb/>lic fund, was not a primary, but an eventual object. <lb/>The following addreſs of
          the committee, in April 1774, <lb/>ſpeaks clearly to this point: <q rend="diple quotes"
            >Agreeable to the plan <lb/>of the Medical Committee, a weekly payment of ſix
            <lb/>ſhillings from the reſpective pariſhes, or friends of <pb n="10"/>
            <lb/>the patients, <note place="bottom" n="*" rend="size(0.75)">
              <p rend="indent">
                <lb/>*This, at a ſubſequent meeting, was made eight ſhillings; which, upon <lb/>the
                ſuppoſition that there would be fifty-four patients in the houſe, made <lb/>an
                annual income of L. 1123; a ſum fully ſufficient for all the expences <lb/>of the
                houſehold, as <hi rend="italic">publickly</hi> declared and <hi rend="italic"
                  >well</hi> underſtood at the time. <lb/>The public ſubſcription was therefore
                clearly intended for <q rend="diple quotes">the building <lb/>and furniſhing a houſe
                  for the <hi rend="italic">reception</hi>, and not for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maintenance</hi>, of in- <lb/>ſane perſons. </q> The contrary is aſſerted, very
                abſurdly, by Mr. Maſon. </p>
            </note> will be ſufficient to defray all the ex- <lb/>pences of the houſehold, without
            the aſſiſtance of any <lb/>fund: So that little more will be required beſides a <lb/>ſum
            adequate to the expence of finiſhing and furniſhing <lb/>the preſent building, together
            with a ſum for carrying <lb/>out the wings, in caſe the number of patients ſhould
            <lb/>increaſe beyond what can be accommodated and <lb/>lodged in the body of the houſe ;
            and of this there is <lb/>a great probability, if we may judge by the nume- <lb/>rous
            applications that have been made from very re- <lb/>mote diſtances. But ſhould the
            ſubſcriptions, for- <lb/>tunately exceed the charge of the neceſſary buildings <lb/>and
            furniture, in that caſe the overplus money will be <lb/>converted into a fund for
            leſſening the weekly pay- <lb/>ments of the patients. </q> But which of the patients
          <lb/>were to be deemed the proper objects of this bounty, <lb/>was left to the judgment of
          the Governors themſelves. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>At the firſt opening of the Aſylum there was no diſtinc- <lb/>tion of patients, and
            <hi rend="italic">all</hi> paid eight ſhillings per week for <lb/>their board and
          medicines; but after a few years it was <lb/>found that this ſum was not
          well-proportioned, as un- <lb/>der this regulation thoſe who were in eaſy circumſtan-
          <lb/>ces paid too little, and thoſe who were poor, and had no <lb/>pariſh relief, paid too
          much. It was therefore ordered, <lb/>for the more extenſive ſervice of the public,That
          perſons <lb/>of better condition ſhould be admitted, on their paying <lb/>a weekly ſum,
          proportioned to their circumſtances: At <lb/>the ſame time it was ordered, That the
          overflowings of <lb/><hi rend="italic">their</hi> weekly payments ſhould be applied in aid
          of thoſe <lb/>perſons who were poor and paid for themſelves. Under <lb/>this charitable
          regulation the Aſylum continued for the <lb/>ſpace of one year, and the ſucceſs proved the
          wiſdom of <pb n="11"/>
          <lb/>the meaſure. But it being obſerved by the phyſician, <lb/>that he was likely to be
          materially injured by this re- <lb/>gulation, however advantageous to the Aſylum, as it
          <lb/>obliged him to attend, <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>, thoſe very perſons who
          <lb/>would otherwiſe have been his owni private patients, it <lb/>was ordered, That he
          ſhould be allowed to take reaſon- <lb/>able fees from ſuch affluent patients: And during
          the <lb/>time that he has acted under this regulation, I am <lb/>ſatisfied that no part of
          his conduct will be found re- <lb/>prehenſible. Some perſons have obſerved, that the
          <lb/>Governors ſhould not have made any alteration in their <lb/>original plan, but have
          kept all the patients at eight <lb/>ſhillings per week. In anſwer to ſuch ſuggeſtions I
          <lb/>ſhall only obſerve, that whoever conſiders the powers <lb/>and circumſtances of men,
          will hold thoſe to be the <lb/>wiſeſt, <hi rend="italic">and really the moſt faithful to
            the duty which they <lb/>owe to the public, who make the beſt uſe of their experi-
            <lb/>ence during their attendance on the public ſervice</hi>. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/><hi rend="italic">Progreſſive</hi> improvements have been made in all <lb/>charities;
          and the governors of Bethlem and St. Luke, <lb/>have, in a particular manner, borne their
          teſtimony to <lb/>the rectitude of ſuch meaſures. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>When Bethlem Hoſpital was erected in 1676, <hi rend="italic">no</hi>
          <lb/>incurables, and only 67 curables were admitted. But <lb/>in 1696, the number of the
          latter was increaſed to 120, <lb/>and in 1728 to 138, when, for the firſt time, three in-
          <lb/>curables were admitted, which in the following year <lb/>were increaſed to 20. At
          this preſent time there are <lb/>160 curables and 100 incurables. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>In the excellent inſtitution of St. Luke's, eſtabliſhed <lb/>in 1751, for incurables,
          there are at preſent 120 cu- <lb/>rables, and only 40 incurables, which laſt pay five
          ſhil- <lb/>lings per week for their maintenance. Of this num- <lb/>ber there are ſix
          patients who are paid for by their re- <lb/>ſpective pariſhes; but by a late regulation,
          pariſhes in <lb/>future are not to receive the benefit of the incurable <pb n="12"/>
          <lb/>fund, it being the intention of the Governors to give <lb/>the greateſt relief to
          thoſe who are in low circumſtances <lb/>and pay for themſelves. And here I beg leave to
          re- <lb/>mark, that this ſmall payment of five ſhillings is not <lb/>fully adequate to the

          <lb/>St. Patrick's Hoſpital in Dublin has a great reſem- <lb/>blance to the York Lunatic
          Aſylum. It was originally <lb/>founded by Dean Swift for the reception and mainte-
          <lb/>nance of <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> lunatics and idiots, but <hi rend="italic"
            >now</hi> receives a few <lb/>patients of <hi rend="italic">good condition</hi>. In this
          Hoſpital 100 inſane <lb/>perſons are lodged and boarded, of which number 18 <lb/>are
          perſons of <hi rend="italic">good condition</hi>, who pay from thirty to <lb/>ſixty
          guineas a-year for board and lodging, together with <lb/>two guineas on admiſſion, and
          eight guineas annually <lb/>(each perſon) to the attending phyſician. The re- <lb/>maining
          80 patients are paupers, and are maintained <lb/>at the expence of the public fund, which
          is about <lb/>L. 1200 a-year. That ſum, together with the ſavings <lb/>from the patients
          of better condition, diſcharges the <lb/>apothecary's ſalary, ſervants' wages, and all the

          <lb/>After this curſory review of ſome of the principal <lb/>hoſpitals for the reception
          of lunatics, I ſhall now deſcend <lb/>to a moſt material part of our own Inſtitution, and
          <lb/>that is the increaſe of its income from the board of the <lb/>patients of the firſt
          claſs. It gives me ſincere pleaſure <lb/>to inform you, that upon the audit of the third
          quarter, <lb/>on the 14th of July laſt, the Aſylum had gained the <lb/>ſum of L. 348,
          after the apothecary's ſalary, the ſervants' <lb/>wages, and all the expences of the
          houſehold had been <lb/>paid. And as the current quarter is likely to equal the <lb/>laſt,
          I dare venture to ſay, that at the expiration of <lb/>the four quarters in October next,
          the ſaving will be <lb/>upwards of L. 450. From this ſum, L. 200 is, by the <lb/>order of
          the laſt General Court, to be paid to the phy- <lb/>ſician, for this year only, in
          compenſation for his con- <lb/>ſent that the treaſurer ſhould take into the common ſtock
          <lb/>all the fees which he was entitled to receive from the <lb/>patients in affluent
          circumſtances. The balance then, in <lb/>favour of the Aſylum, will be L. 250; and, it is
          pro- <lb/>bable, that a ſum equal to this balance will be annually <lb/>left in the hands
          of the treaſurer, to be applied as the <lb/>Governors may think proper <note

            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>* By way of experience the phyſician's fees (for this year only) were
              <lb/>converted into a ſalary of L. 200, in order that the Governors might know
              <lb/>exactly the profits that ariſe from the patients of better condition. They
              <lb/>are now in poſſeſſion of that knowledge; ſo that at a future day they may,

          <lb/>The Reverend Mr. Maſon, in the <q rend="quotes">Animadverſions </q>

          the Lunatic Aſylum. No perſon that I <lb/>know of ever denied the poſition. All the public
          <lb/>advertiſements declare it. But <hi rend="italic">the</hi> relief intended, and
          <lb/>publickly given out, was, That they, and ſuch inſane <lb/>perſons as were in low
          circumſtances, ſhould be lodged <lb/>in the Aſylum, and ſupplied with board and medicines
          <lb/>at the rate of eight ſhillings per week, each perſon. That <pb n="14"/>

              <lb/>* When the Aſylum was firſt eſtabliſhed, pariſhes paid for their inſane
              <lb/>paupers confined at Bramham, the ſum of ten guineas for the firſt quar- <lb/>ter,
              and half a guinea per week ever after. </p>
          </note>. I know <lb/>of no title that pariſhes can have to any further re- <lb/>lief from
          this Charity. Upon the reduction-fund <lb/>they can have no poſſible claim, as no part of
          it be- <lb/>longs to the original ſubſcription. It is independent <lb/>of the
          ſubſcription, being the bounty of Lady Gower, <lb/>Mrs. Bourchier, and Mrs. Bouverie, for
          the expreſs <lb/>purpoſe of granting relief, at the diſcretion of the Go- <lb/>vernors, to
          ſuch inſane perſons as are in low circum- <lb/>ſtances, but on no account to be employed
          in the build- <lb/>ing. To this fund, which produces L. 35 annually, is <lb/>added about
          L. 200 more, being the annual ſurplus of <lb/>the payments of thoſe patients who are in
          affluent cir- <lb/>cumſtances, after diſcharging their board, medicines, <lb/>and medical
          attendance. Mr. Maſon has totally mi- <lb/>ſtaken the nature of the government of the
          Lunatic <lb/>Aſylum. As, on the reduction-fund, pariſhes have not <lb/>the ſhadow of a
          claim, neither are they entitled to any <lb/>thing from the general ſubſcription, as the
          treaſurer has <lb/>only in bank about L. 1200, which is ſet apart for de- <lb/>fraying the
          expence of the preſent additional building, <lb/>together with L. 1300, the intereſt of
          which is under a <lb/>perpetual appropriation to the repairs of the houſe and
          <lb/>furniture. Every expence of the houſehold is de- <lb/>frayed by the patients
          themſelves, agreeably to the <hi rend="italic">ori- <lb/>ginal</hi> conſtitution, by
          payments proportioned to their <lb/>abilities; and I beg leave to repeat, that from the
          be- <lb/>ginning of the Inſtitution to the preſent hour, there ne- <lb/>ver has been one
          farthing of the ſubſcription-money ap- <lb/>propriated by the Governors either to the
          maintenance <lb/>of the patients, the attendance of the phyſician, the ſalary <lb/>of the
          apothecary, or the wages of the ſervants. The <lb/>whole public money, conſequently,
          remains with the Ho- <lb/>ſpital eſtate. If Mr. Maſon could make it appear that <lb/>the
          inſane pariſh-poor can be maintained in the Aſylum <lb/>for leſs than eight ſhillings
          weekly, he would in that <lb/>caſe have a reaſonable plea for a reduction of their pay-

          <lb/>ments; but till then, his pamphlet will be conſidered <lb/>as the indication of
          ſomething not perfectly right in <lb/>the temper of its author, and will add but little to
          his <lb/>honourable reputation. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>Had Mr. Maſon informed himſelf of the real ſtate of <lb/>the Aſylum, I am ſatisfied
          that he would not have pub- <lb/>liſhed <q rend="quotes">Animadverſions </q> againſt, but
          in favour of that <lb/>Charity. Independent of the relief given to the pariſh- <lb/>poor
          and perſons in low circumſtances, the benefits are <lb/>great to thoſe few who are in eaſy
          circumſtances. The <lb/>payments made by them are moderate, and always <lb/>ſuited to the
          circumſtances of their families. The ex- <lb/>pences of no patient exceed L. 1:4s per
          week; for <lb/>which moderate ſum they have hitherto been provided <lb/>with meat, drink,
          waſhing, lodging, medicines, and <lb/><hi rend="italic">medical attendance</hi>. Pariſhes
          pay eight ſhillings for <lb/>their inſane poor, and perſons in low circumſtances, <lb/>who

            perſon, by name Matthew Wilcoxon, was diſ- <lb/>charged the houſe, in which he had for
            about eight <lb/>years been a moſt uſeful ſervant. This reſpectable <lb/>old man had,
            for many years before, been in that way <lb/>of buſineſs; he had ſeen much of the
            practice of <lb/>Bethlem-Hoſpital, had acted under Dr. Monro, and <lb/>was poſſeſt of
            many of his preſcriptions, and for his <lb/>competent ſkill, at leaſt in common caſes,
            and ſtill <pb n="16"/>
            <lb/>more for his great care and humanity, was patronized <lb/>by Dr. Dealtry himſelf,
            who conſtantly recommended <lb/>him, when lunatic caſes came before him, even to
            <lb/>perſons of condition. When the Aſylum was nearly <lb/>finiſhed, this man was
            conſulted concerning it, and, <lb/>after rectifying many miſtakes in the building,
            <lb/>brought his own patients into it, and, relinquiſhing <lb/>his own private houſe,
            became principal manager, <lb/>keeper, nay, and apothecary too (at leaſt occaſionally),
            <lb/>for the ſmall annual ſalary of L. 40. Yet, at or about <lb/>this very time, he was
            diſmiſſed; and how diſmiſſed? <lb/>With a penſion of L. 20 <hi rend="italic">per
              annum</hi> for life, and with <lb/>leave to take with him ſuch of his own patients as
            <lb/>then remained in the houſe. He is now in his 77th <lb/>year, but in the full vigour
            of all his faculties, and ex- <lb/>cept a natural diminution of bodily ſtrength, as com-
            <lb/>petent to ſuperintend ſuch an hoſpital as ever. He <lb/>ſtill, in the ſuburbs of
            York, keeps a few patients, as <lb/>many as his neat but ſmall cottage will permit him
            to <lb/>keep, and in the greateſt order and decency. Many <lb/>remarks might be made on
            this anecdote, but I only <lb/>propoſe this ſingle queſtion: Was his diſmiſſion the

          <lb/>That Mr. Wilcoxon acted in Bethlem-Hoſpital as a <lb/>ſervant I allow; but that his
          being in poſſeſſion of ſome <lb/>of Dr. Monro's preſcriptions would make him a phyſi-
          <lb/>cian, is what no man in his ſenſes will admit. Mr. <lb/>Maſon aſſerts, that Mr.
          Wilcoxon brought his <hi rend="italic">patients</hi>

          <lb/>ready coſt him L. 120;—a conſiderable ſum indeed! <lb/>but ſufficiently repaid by the

          <lb/>Now, in direct oppoſition to Mr. Maſon's charges, <lb/>I pledge myſelf to prove, that
          the committee uſed <lb/>their moſt ſtrenuous endeavours to purchaſe land in <lb/>the

          land on <lb/>which the Aſylum now ſtands. What comes within my <lb/>knowledge is, That
          ſoon after the firſt general meeting <lb/>of the ſubſcribers to the Aſylum, the committee

          application re- <pb n="18"/>
          <lb/>ceived a direct negative. Still anxious to have ground in <lb/>the neighbourhood of
          the County Infirmary, they ap- <lb/>plied to the late Mr. Yoward for two acres of land,
          which <lb/>lay directly oppoſite the Infirmary, and for which the <lb/>unreaſonable ſum of
          L. 600 was demanded. </p>

          <lb/>This court, upon a full and ſerious reconſideration <lb/>of the principle of that

          <lb/>now confirm it, and does alſo confirm the rule whereby <lb/>patients ſent into this
          Aſylum by pariſh-officers, and, <lb/>according to the ſtrict injunction of the law,
          maintained <lb/>at the charge of their reſpective pariſhes, are rated at <lb/>8 s. per
          week each, this being the computed average <lb/>expence of maintaining each patient; the
          court being <lb/>clearly of opinion that whenever the means ariſe, it is <lb/>more in the
          true ſpirit of charity, that thoſe means <lb/>ſhould be applied to the relief of
          neceſſitous individuals, <lb/>than to the eaſe and accommodation of the opulent

          <lb/>And whereas the court having conſidered, that it <lb/>was unfit and unjuſt, that

          <lb/>indigent, enjoy the gratuitous aſſiſtance of the attend- <lb/>ing phyſician, did
          reſolve, Auguſt 26, 1785, to requeſt <lb/>the phyſician to accept, from patients of the
          former <lb/>deſcription, the reaſonable emoluments of his profeſſion: <lb/>And whereas by
          a ſubſequent reſolution of Auguſt 24, <lb/>1787, the court did requeſt the phyſician, to
          accept a <lb/>ſalary of L. 200 for the enſuing year, in lieu of fees <lb/>from patients of
          the ſuperior claſs; this court, upon a <lb/>ſerious and deliberate review of this
          laſt-mentioned re- <lb/>ſolution, determines not to renew it at this period, but
          <lb/>requeſts the phyſician henceforth to receive ſuch mode- <lb/>rate and reaſonable fees
