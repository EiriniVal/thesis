            <title type="main">The POWER OF GOLD DISPLAYED, in the HUMANE PROPOSAL of the Right Hon.
              WILLIAM PITT, CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, to bring forward An Act to put his Majesty
              into the disagreeable Situation of signing a Decree, that no sick or lame Person, or
              diseased Cattle, in Great Britain, shall have a Medicine of Repute without paying
              Tribute; which the Writer contends, is not justifiable either by the Law of God, or
              Man, and is a disgraceful Impost, as it places the Life of a human Being in
              competition with a Three-penny or Six-penny Stamp, &amp;c. </title>

          citizens of a free country, bleſſed with <lb/>the name of Britons? Survey your fetters,
          woven by imaginary power, rivetted by <lb/>terror, which have diſgraced yourſelves, and
          reflect no credit either on your King or <lb/>country. The Barons of the Exchequer, the
          guardians of conſtitutional freedom, are <lb/>now your friends; they have declared from
          the bench of Juſtice, no ſuch acts as the <lb/>medicine act is, (which operates only by
          fear, in a partial manner on the ſubject, <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">trary</w>
          to the dictates of reaſon, juſtice, and humanity, founded on no decree of the
          <lb/>Legiſlature,) ought to exiſt in this land; at the ſame time they obſerved, the more
          <lb/>they read the act, the leſs they underſtood it, and with alacrity granted Meſſrs.
          Wray <lb/>a new trial, who had been found guilty of the heinous crimes of ſelling <hi
            rend="italic">two tooth <lb/>bruſhes</hi> with tooth powder. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Gentlemen, have I not reaſon to rejoice, have I not reaſon to triumph,
          who at the <lb/>firſt commencement of this ambiguous, ill-ſhapen act, oppoſed its
          monſtrous ſtride; <lb/>and whoſe leviathan maw was only to be ſatiated with all that a
          man, or a miniſter of <lb/>ſtate, ſhould hold worth preſerving, viz. the honour of his
          King, the liberty of the <lb/>ſubject, the dignity of his country? For theſe have I
          pleaded, for theſe have I braved <lb/>danger, in my tracts, Advice to Bookſellers,
          Diſcurſory Thoughts, &amp;c. How could <lb/>you, ye men of books, ſacrifice to fear your
          known good opinion of your Monarch? <lb/>How could you believe his royal heart delighted
          to add diſtreſs to miſery? What have <lb/>you obſerved in your King, to credit the
          diſgraceful ſtory? A King ſigning an act, <lb/>that when his ſubject was bit by a mad dog,
          it demanded a tribute from the terrified <lb/>ſufferer, or no medicine to heal his wound;
          or that his Majeſty's finances were ſo re-<lb/>duced, as to oblige him to countenance an
          edict, which bows to the proſtitute, in <lb/>pleaſing view; by her, that baneful curſe of
          health ſhall ſpread its poignant ſting, which <lb/>demands inevitably the ſwift aid of
          medicine, fettered with a ſtamp. Would Rome have <lb/>thus chid her ſons who had
          indiſcreetly ſacrificed to nature's laws? No — it is only at a <lb/>Stamp Office where
          Haman's fell principles in epitome are remembered. Can you <w part="I">re-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">concile</w> to your minds, a King, and ſuch a paternal King as ours is, bleſt
          with a Queen, <lb/>an amiable Queen, whom even ſlander ne'er whiſpered ſurmiſe of ill;
          could her King, <lb/>and our Monarch, ſign ſo ungracious an act, which wreſts a tax from
          the helpleſs <lb/>female ſervant, becauſe the imbecility of her ſex demands the friendly
          aid of <w part="I">me-</w><lb/><w part="F">dicine</w> at certain times? It is not
          poſſible. Can a King take againſt his own ſubjects, <lb/>and exult in their miſery? Is
          royalty a bar to diſeaſe? Will <hi rend="sc">Fevers, Gout, <w part="I">Drop-</w><lb/><w
              part="F">sy</w>, Consumption, Evil, Leprosy, Stone, Cholic,</hi> ſtand at a diſtance,
          nor dare <lb/>invade the palace? Then may we ſuppoſe that Kings feel not as common men. Is
          it <lb/>not enough for human nature to bear the ills which ſickneſs, diſeaſe, or accidents
            <w part="I">cre-</w><lb/><w part="F">ate</w>, without being tortured by forward, cruel
          ſervants of the crown, who to gratify <lb/>the luſt of power, trample on all laws, human
          and divine? Whilſt they reprobate <lb/>a highwayman's proceedings, they act on the ſame
          principle, only diverſified in the <lb/>application; for have not ſervants of the crown
          demanded of you, by threats, to act <lb/>contrary to the conſtitution of this country,
          which militated againſt yourſelves, and <lb/>aggrandized your neighbour; which muſt
          transfer your buſineſs to another ſhop, <lb/>where no croſſed ſtamp mark'd the threſhold,
          Who would have credited the <w part="I">re-</w><lb/><w part="F">port</w>, ſhould it have
          been foretold, that miniſters of this country would have <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">ſiſted</w> on their ſervants to go round the kingdom with the Exchequer cudgel
          in their <lb/>hand, and threaten bookſellers to commit an act which human nature revolts
          at, To <lb/>refuſe a woman in labour a cheap medicine to eaſe her pains without paying for
          a ſtamp. <lb/>Let her die firſt, is the language of the Stamp Office; or, We'll exchequer
          you. <w part="I">A-</w><lb/><w part="F">gain</w>, find a parallel in any hiſtory, ſtate,
          or country, of the following impoſt; I <lb/>challenge all the antiquarians of the age to
          do it; a tax (proclaim not the diſgraceful <lb/>badge) which the officers of the crown of
          Great Britain have demanded, in the King's <lb/>name, on a Pot of Ointment to cure the
          Itch; and inſiſted the polluted out-caſt wretch, <lb/>though ſcarce cloaths to cover his
          nakedneſs, ſhould pay Threepence for a ſtamp, or <pb xml:id="page_3" n="3"/><lb/>his
          diſeaſe ſhould worry him to death; or, what would turn to a better profit for the
          <lb/>Stamp Office, he might infect other perſons, and then, joyful ſound, more ſtamps
          <lb/>would be diſpoſed of. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Theſe are the decrees, formed under the conſtruction of the King's
          Stamp Office! <lb/>Are theſe deeds proper to be ranged in the Hiſtorian's page, as acts of
          George the IIId? <lb/>Why, then, not procure a law, that whatever perſon is ſhipwrecked on
          your coaſt, <lb/>he ſhall take ſo many ſtamps; or thoſe perſons who have their houſes
          burnt down, <lb/>they ſhall be obliged to buy your paper currency, <hi rend="italic">id
            eſt</hi> ſtamps. Theſe acts, miniſters <lb/>may ſay, are diſgraceful, and no nation but
          an abandoned one, would enact them. <lb/>Are they ſo? Not more than the imaginary medicine
          act, which is ſo pious, ſo <w part="I">loy-</w><lb/><w part="F">ally</w> conſtrued for the
          honour and intereſt of the King, and he that will not gulp the <lb/>creed down, is
          flagelated with the Exchequer ſcourge, to urge the bookſeller to be <lb/>upon the watch;
          where, if he ſees a fellow-creature fall from his horſe and bruiſe <lb/>himſelf, the
          unfortunate perſon muſt purchaſe a ſtamp before he can receive a <w part="I"
            >medi-</w><lb/><w part="F">cine</w> to ſooth his pain. Can there be (to Britons I
          appeal) a more humiliating, <w part="I">diſ-</w><lb/><w part="F">graceful</w> circumſtance
          in this country, than to ſee a ſet of loyal ſubjects pointed at <lb/>by a malignant
          partiality founded in a jealous ſurmiſe, harraſſed by the Stamp Office, <lb/>under the
          ſhadow of an act of Parliament, to commit actions which are almoſt as <w part="I"
            >unna-</w><lb/><w part="F">tural</w> as if they were required to ſell their children.
          Yet no act of Parliament exiſts <lb/>which will warrant ſuch encroachments on the ſubject.
          For the dignity of human <lb/>nature, for the honour of my King and Country, I have
          pleaded and oppoſed theſe <lb/>arbitrary unjuſtifiable deeds, which heretofore were never
          countenanced in this or any <lb/>other free country. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Who will join iſſue, and ſay, ſuch heavy impoſts torn from the ſick,
          the lame, the <lb/>diſeaſed part of the community, are to be countenanced in this
          Chriſtian land? Not <lb/>the Houſe of Commons, not the Houſe of Lords, not his Majeſty,
          nor even the <lb/>Hon. Wm. Pitt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, whoſe great power ſtands
          unrivalled; <lb/>witneſs, Britons wearing a ſtamp on their heads. Then, if there is no act
          of <w part="I">Legiſla-</w><lb/><w part="F">ture</w> to juſtify theſe ſhameful, pilfering
          depredations from the people, why does a <w part="I">mi-</w><lb/><w part="F">niſter</w>
          withhold his protection one ſeſſions after another from a ſet of men, only <w part="I"
            >ſuffer-</w><lb/><w part="F">ers</w> becauſe they are loyal, becauſe they are
          conſcientious men, becauſe they are <w part="I">fear-</w><lb/><w part="F">ful</w> to
          contend with Government? Is it for the honour of a miniſter to ſport his <lb/>ſtrength
          with the man unarmed by power, naked as to riches, and whom he can <w part="I"
            >ter-</w><lb/><w part="F">rify</w> with the anathema, wrote in Exchequer form, in like
          manner as the approach of <lb/>a wolf ſpreads terror to the flock? Do miniſters of the
          crown expect the people to <lb/>act virtuouſly, to live honeſtly, to poſſeſs integrity;
          let miniſters look at the medicine <lb/>act; there they will ſee oppreſſion ſtalk with
          gigantic ſtride, treading on the liberty of <lb/>the ſubject, laughing at juſtice, and
          ſacrificing humanity to malignancy and avarice. <lb/>Why will miniſters of ſtate form ſuch
          crippled paths for the inferior ranks of <w part="I">man-</w><lb/><w part="F">kind</w> to
          walk on? Why will not the Rulers of the nation, when they find errors in <lb/>their acts
          of parliament, ſhew a readineſs to correct them? For intereſt they will do <lb/>it. Has,
          then, honour nor juſtice no claim to attention? Is it not, ye guardians of <lb/>the land,
          a ſore affliction to the owner of cattle, to hear his beaſt low with pain? Is <lb/>that
          beaſt, or is an infant dying with diſeaſe, an object of taxation? I only aſk the
          <lb/>queſtion. Are they fit objects for ſport? If they are, throw off the mask, enact a
          <lb/>law, that every perſon ſhall conſume a ſtamp between his bread and butter every
          <lb/>morning; or that the people inhabiting Great Britain ſhall be bled four times a year,
          <lb/>or take a ſtamp. Theſe laws, theſe acts, would be more honourable, more equitable,
          <lb/>than your proceedings on the medicine act, where you doom a fellow-creature to death,
          <lb/>rather than loſe ſelling a ſtamp with a common medicine conveyed by a <w part="I"
            >book-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſeller</w>, although no act of Legiſlature exiſts to juſtify
          ſuch proceedings. To tax <lb/>Quacks, or any other titulary traders, if hurtful to the
          community, I am not <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">cerned</w>; but when I obſerve
          his Majeſty's honourable Commiſſioners of the Stamp <lb/>Office breathing a language,
          inſtead of villainous deceitful Quack, it is now, Dear <lb/>brother, good creature, ſell
          your medicines, ſell your ſtuff, ſell your poiſons, or <lb/>what you will, only ſell our
          ſtamps. When I hear that men in ſo honourable a <lb/>ſtation ſend their emiſſaries round
          the country, inſiſting on bookſellers taking out a <lb/>Five Shilling Licence, on pain of
          being exchequered, and oblige them to ſell ſtamps, <lb/>and ſay, you are the perſons
          Government meant to tax, as we conſtrue it ſo and ſo; <lb/>and at the ſame time let a next
          door neighbour ſell without ſtamps, the ſame <w part="I">commo-</w><lb/><w part="F"

            <pb xml:id="page_4" n="4"/><lb/>than reprobate ſuch actions, which diſgrace man, mar the
          beauty of our <w part="I">conſtitu-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w>, and render our Monarch
          the object of pity. Reflection, awake not, leſt thou <lb/>bring to remembrance what this
          country was a few years back, when the people <lb/>paid their taxes as chearful as one who
          giveth his corn to be ground and received flour <lb/>in return: but now, our corn is
          demanded, and bran is thought a ſufficient <w part="I">recom-</w><lb/><w part="F"
            >pence</w>. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>In former adminiſtrations, Juſtice and Humanity adorned our ſuperiors'
          councils; <lb/>but now, an avaricious deceitful principle ſways the officers of the crown,
          who <w part="I">luxu-</w><lb/><w part="F">riouſly</w> bask in the thought of the vaſt

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Who can behold even a dog in pain that can avoid pity if he cannot

          the evil, with a <lb/>cancerous gaſhing wound, with a ſcald head, a human body covered
          with ulcers, <lb/>ſtinking moſt diſguſtfully horrible, deteſted by its inmate, the ſoul
          chained to ſo vile <lb/>a peſtilential body, which is ſhunned by ſociety, and whoſe
          corrupted form breathes <lb/>poiſonous vapours, which petrify the man by profeſſion bred a

          objects, and from <w part="I">diſ-</w><lb/><w part="F">eaſed</w> cattle, a Miniſter of
          State, with as much compoſure as a rat-catcher kills vermin, <lb/>meditated an act of
          parliament which would pointedly militate againſt the welfare of <lb/>the human and brute
          creation, loaded with inſupportable infirmities, for he enacted <lb/>that medicines of
          eſtabliſhed reputation; which were adminiſtered either by outward <lb/>or inward
          application, ſhould not be applied unleſs they gave a ſtipulated ſum for a <lb/>piece of

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>What is this decree but a ſecondary one to Nebuchadnezzar's which
          threatened <lb/>death to thoſe who did not bow to the idol of Gold? Yet this medicine act,
          under <lb/>the diſpenſation of the goſpel, is far more cruel. Does Chriſtian power act
          here like a <lb/>Samaritan, to pour oil into the wound? How reverſed! Does it act, like
          the Levite and <lb/>Prieſt, who are held up by the Saviour of the world as men actuated by
          ſelfiſh <w part="I">princi-</w><lb/><w part="F">ples</w>, void of compaſſion? <hi
            rend="italic">No.</hi> — The Prieſt and the Levite, if they did not relieve <pb
            xml:id="page_6" n="6"/><lb/>the wounded man, were not as yet ſuch hardened monſters as
          to take advantage of his <lb/>diſtreſs. Formerly Kings of Albion delighted to act the
          phyſician's part, and <lb/>inveſted the unhappy mortal, afflicted with the EVIL, with a
          piece of gold; Heaven <lb/>ſanctified the deed: Now a miniſter urges his Majeſty to levy
          on his own diſeaſed <lb/>ſubject a piece of money, or neither he, nor yet his beaſt, if
          ill, ſhall be entitled to <lb/>the general benefits of medicine, Heaven's gift, which by
          providence was deſigned to <lb/>be as free for all nature's children as the air we
          breathe, or the water of the earth; <lb/>the wretch who taxes one, would, could his
          unhumanized ſoul find means, curſe the <lb/>other with his official breath — for lucre. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>The medicine act, whilſt in debate, is the miniſter's; but when the
          King ſigns the mandate it is then cloathed with royalty, it ſpeaks majeſtic, and awes the
          ſubject to compliance with tremendous voice; the inhabitants of Great Britain muſt hear a
          King ſpeak to his officers of ſtate agreeable to the act: "Let no one of my <w part="I"
            >ſub-</w><lb/><w part="F">jects</w>, who are grievouſly tormented with pains,
          mortifications, gangrene wounds, fluxes, and other deadly diſeaſes, have certain medicines
          they deſire, unleſs they pay a tribute, on pain of my diſpleaſure, and the heavy penalties
          the act preſcribes." </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Is not this a fair delineation of the intended act? — Divines ſay bad
          thoughts and diabolical actions originate below, from whence we pretend to borrow colours
          to paint an infernal ſcene; but the original deſign, I am inclined to think, is too often
            <w part="I">bor-</w><lb/><w part="F">rowed</w> from earth. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Suppoſe a miniſter ſhould have power to perſuade the King to approve
          of <lb/>the edict — what is this edict? Man may ſtile it a medicine act, but I call it a
          <lb/>redemptory act — What ſays the act? pay a tribute, or no medicine; woe to the man
          <lb/>who dares let any perſon have a medicinal packet without a ſtamp; here is your <w

          King's leave — <hi rend="italic">to live</hi> — Courteous <lb/>Royal bequeſt — what
          wonderful condeſcenſion. Is not this the true explanation and <lb/>intent of the act,
          fabricated in this once truly honoured iſland, the envy of all foreign <lb/>powers? Rather
          than thus inflict the ſickly diſeaſed ſubject, I ask the Miniſter, I <lb/>ask the Rt. Hon.
          William Pitt, whether it would not redound more to his <lb/>honour as a man, as miniſter
          of colloſſian power, to ſend round a party of guards to <lb/>the healthy perſons, and
          demand of them to give ſixpence for the emblazoned <lb/>paper or put them to death, rather
          than go to the ſick man, expiring with diſeaſe, <lb/>tormented with ulcers and carious
          bones, and inſiſt on his taking the official ſtamps, <lb/>by which the gold already
          produced being ſufficient to turn any miniſter's brain, <lb/>he imagines he is in

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>What ſentiments do miniſters imbibe by attending a king's throne? Is
          the life of a <lb/>Briton to be put in competition with a three-penny, ſix-penny, or a one
          ſhilling ſtamp? <lb/>Britons! there was a time you were not held ſo cheap; but now, if no
          ſtamp at hand no <lb/>medicine, or perhaps the needy ſhopkeeper may have a ſtamp which may
          be turned to <lb/>money, ſells an old decayed medicine, which buys a loaf to feed a
          famiſhed child, <lb/>whilſt the parent of a worthy family falls a ſacrifice to the

          pretty <lb/>plants will droop, nay die. — If pain attacks them does their royal birth
          fortify them <lb/>to be indifferent as to the effects or conſequences? — They are attended

        <p rend="indent"><lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>HE propoſed medicine act, I have read; perhaps
          it may now lay before that <lb/>venerable, truly honourable Houſe of Lords, for their
          conſideration, either to <lb/>countenance or reject. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Cool and diſpaſſionate, as if now before their Lordſhips, I ſolemnly
          declare in my <lb/>humble opinion, the medicine act as now engroſſed, cannot with
          propriety be <w part="I">com-</w><lb/><w part="F">plied</w> with; it requires moral
          impoſſibilities, and has many abſurdities; let it be tried by <lb/>the penetration of
          wiſdom; it is an impolitic propoſal, it militates powerfully againſt <lb/>the intereſt of
          government, and the life of the ſubject. Unhappy conſequences will <lb/>prove its baneful
          effects; nor ſhall I wonder when a woman's mind is agitated with <lb/>the cries of her
          infant, ſhe ſeeks the uſual remedy on theſe occaſions, and is told the <lb/>King demands a
          tax for a ſtamp, or no medicine; your child may periſh. In <w part="I">aſto-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">niſhment</w> ſhe forgets the mother, when ſhe hears the monarch has forgot he
          is a <lb/>father — drops her child inſenſibly, and marks the earth with <hi rend="sc"
            >Blood</hi>. Is there <lb/>juſtice in the act?—No;—juſtice is violated, the poor ſick
          man is the glorious prize <lb/>which this act drags in triumph. — Will Benevolence
          patronize the deed?—No; <lb/>— cruelty ſtands confeſſed. Mark the eſſence of the words,
          the very criterion of the <lb/>act. To tax all <hi rend="italic">medicinal noſtrums which
            are uſed either to heal the human body by <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">ternal</w>
            or external application, when diſeaſed.</hi> Heavens!!! what a crime it is now deemed
          <lb/>to endeavour to reſtore health, the fountain of ſtrength and beauty to the ſons and
          <lb/>daughters of the land; rather ſay, what a heart that man muſt have, if man you can
          <lb/>call him, who could dictate theſe inimical wiſhes, with a view to ſtamp them into a
          <lb/>law. Let the proſecuted wretch who ſteals for bread, plead this illuſtrious example
          <lb/>of depravity in a higher power; then let government put to death the victim, and be
          <lb/>ſatisfied he ſuffered juſtly; in the ſight of his Maker, reaſon and equity will <w
            part="I">de-</w><lb/><w part="F">clare</w> him murdered. Will Chriſtianity adopt this
          maxim of taxation for one of <lb/>her precepts?—No,—nor no other religion in the world;
          nor can there be even a faint <lb/>trace of any ſtate, nation, or human being ſo unhappily
          diveſted of the feelings of <lb/>humanity ſince the world began, as the authors of this
          uncharitable mode of <w part="I">taxa-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w>. What is this but
          engrafting the tenets of an inquiſition on a Britiſh ſtock? <lb/>Exact money, or let a
          perſon remain in torture; define it otherwiſe candor, if you <lb/>can. Inquiſitors of
          Spain would abhor the idea of adding diſtreſs to the afflicted for <lb/>the ſake of gain,
          they would abjure ſuch a doctrine as the one now propoſed by the <lb/>Miniſter of Great
          Britain; not to let a ſick or lame, or diſeaſed perſon have a medicine <lb/>to remedy his
          pain, his complaint, and render himſelf once more a uſeful member <lb/>to ſociety, without
          paying a tribute; what a language does this refined ſyſtem of <w part="I">tax-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">ation</w> diſplay in this land, boaſting of a ſuperlative degree of piety
          towards God? <lb/>It is an awful circumſtance, and a new phenomenon, to behold the hand
          writing of a <lb/>king, acting partially to his innocent ſubjects, firſt cut off from the
          general ſociety of <lb/>the world by illneſs, now made the propoſed objects of ſingular
          chaſtiſement of their <lb/>Sovereign. Let Britain talk no more of virtue, honour, valour,
          humanity, charity, <lb/>or whatever enobles man, exalts a ſtate or dignifies a king, that
          ſcrawl indented on <lb/>the parchment, that hoſtile declaration againſt all diſeaſed
          ſubjects, or whatſoever <lb/>preſerves the human body from decay, if enforced, cancels all
          pretenſions to <w part="I">great-</w><lb/><w part="F">ness</w>, or whatſoever is
          praiſe-worthy. </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>If the arguments of <hi rend="italic">ſenſibility</hi> intimately
