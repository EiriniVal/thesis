        country; to hunt, ſail, indulge <lb/>himſelf in reſt, but more frequently to uſe
        <lb/>exerciſe. He ought to refuſe no kind of <lb/>food that is commonly uſed, but ſometimes

        ſcrupulouſly to avoid intercourſe with <lb/>the fair ſex: Pleaſures of this kind, rarely
        <lb/>indulged, render the body alert and active, <lb/>but, when too frequently repeated,
        weak <lb/>and languid. He ſhould be careful, in <lb/>time of health, not to deſtroy, by
        exceſſes <lb/>of any kind, that vigour of conſtitution <lb/>which ſhould ſupport him under
        ſickneſs." </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_2" n="2"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Keep conſtant to a plain diet. Thoſe <lb/>enjoy moſt health, and live
        longeſt, that <lb/>avoid curioſity and variety of meats and <lb/>drinks. Aged and decrepid
        perſons ought <lb/>to eat often, and but little at a time, of <lb/>moiſt and liquid food, as
        ſuch food <w part="I">nou-</w><lb/><w part="F">riſhes</w> ſooneſt, and digeſts eaſieſt. The
        <lb/>leſs a ſick perſon eats, the ſooner he will <lb/>recover; for it is a true ſaying, <hi
          rend="italic">The more <lb/>you fill foul bodies the more you hurt them.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The moſt unhealthy are found among <lb/>thoſe who feed high upon the
        moſt delicious <lb/>dainties, and drink ſtrong and ſpiritous <w part="I">li-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">quors</w>; whereas others, who want ſuch <w part="I">de-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >licate</w> fare, are ſeldom ſick, unleſs they have <lb/>ſuch unſatiable appetites as to
        eat too <lb/>much. Experience teaches men, that, <w part="I">af-</w><lb/><w part="F">ter</w>
        they have indulged their appetites to <lb/>exceſs, they find themſelves heavy and dull,
        <lb/>and often ſleepy, which ſufficiently ſhews <lb/>that thoſe meals are prejudicial to the
          <w part="I">wel-</w><lb/><w part="F">fare</w> of the body; whereas, in the morning
        <lb/>before they have eaten, they are light and <lb/>pleaſantly eaſy. To ſup ſparingly is
        moſt <lb/>healthful, becauſe the ſtomach being not <lb/>over burthened, the ſleep is more
        pleaſant; <lb/>and from ſparing-ſuppers, the breeding of <lb/>thoſe humours is prevented,
        which cauſe <pb xml:id="page_3" n="3"/><lb/>defluxions, rheumatiſms, gouts, dropſies,
        <lb/>giddineſs, and corruption in the mouth <lb/>from the ſcurvy. From faſting, or a very
        <lb/>ſpare diet, many indiſpoſitions may be <w part="I">cu-</w><lb/><w part="F">red</w>. And
        to preſerve health, one meal <lb/>ſhould not be eaten till the former has <w part="I"
          >paſ-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſed</w> clean out of the ſtomach (which is <lb/>known when
        hunger calls for another <w part="I">ſup-</w><lb/><w part="F">ply)</w> by means of which
        conſtant practice, <lb/>the food will be converted to good chyle, <lb/>and from good chyle,
        which is a milk-like <lb/>ſubſtance, good blood will be bred, and <lb/>from good blood
        generous ſpirits will be <lb/>produced, on which a healthy conſtitution <lb/>and liberal
        mind will enſue; but on the <lb/>contrary, when too great a quantity of food <lb/>is taken
        (for the pleaſure of taſte) which <lb/>the ſtomach cannot well digeſt, the chyle <lb/>will
        become raw and corrupt, foul the <lb/>blood, effect the paſſions, and render the <lb/>body
        diſordered and unhealthy. Miſers, <lb/>who eat and drink but little, live long. <lb/>Two
        meals a day are ſaid to be ſufficient <lb/>for weak people, and all perſons after fifty
        <lb/>years of age, as the omitting of ſuppers <lb/>conduceth much to their health. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Every intention in the cure of diſorders <lb/>may be anſwered by diet
        alone; but the <pb xml:id="page_4" n="4"/><lb/>food muſt be wholeſome, and taken <w part="I"
          >regu-</w><lb/><w part="F">lar</w>, or the conſequences will be bad. The <lb/>poor are
        generally the firſt who ſuffer by <lb/>unwholeſome food, which often cauſes <w part="I"
          >in-</w><lb/><w part="F">fection</w>, and reaches people in every <w part="I"
          >ſta-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w>. There are many ways by which <lb/>proviſions may be
        rendered unwholeſome. <lb/>Acts of Providence we muſt ſubmit to. <lb/>Bad ſeaſons may either
        prevent the <w part="I">ripen-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> of grain, or damage it
        afterwards; but <lb/>no puniſhment can be too ſevere for thoſe <lb/>who ſuffer proviſions to
        ſpoil, by <w part="I">hoard-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> them, in order to raiſe the price.
        All <lb/>animal ſubſtances have a conſtant tendency <lb/>to putrefaction; and the ſoundeſt
        grain, <lb/>if kept too long, becomes unfit for uſe. <lb/>No animal can be wholeſome which
        does <lb/>not take ſufficient exerciſe. Moſt of our <lb/>ſtalled cattle, ſwine, &amp;c. are
        crammed <lb/>with groſs food, but not allowed exerciſe <lb/>nor free air, by which means
        they indeed <lb/>grow fat, but their humours, not being <lb/>properly prepared, remain
        crude, and <w part="I">oc-</w><lb/><w part="F">caſion</w> indigeſtions, groſs humours, and
        <lb/>oppreſſion of the ſpirits, in thoſe who feed <lb/>upon them. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Good tea, taken in moderation, not too <lb/>ſtrong nor too hot, nor
        drunk upon an <pb xml:id="page_5" n="5"/><lb/>empty ſtomach, will ſeldom do harm; but
        <lb/>if it be bad, or ſubſtituted in place of ſolid <lb/>food, it muſt be prejudicial. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>All high-ſeaſoning, pickles, &amp;c. are only <lb/>incentives to luxury,
        and never fail to hurt <lb/>the ſtomach. Plain roaſting or boiling is <lb/>all that the
        ſtomach requires. Were <w part="I">fer-</w><lb/><w part="F">mented</w> liquors faithfully
        prepared, kept to <lb/>a proper age, and uſed in moderation, they <lb/>would prove real
        bleſſings; but while they <lb/>are ill prepared, and various ways adultered, <lb/>ſince
        preparing and vending of them have <lb/>become the moſt coveted and lucrative <lb/>branches
        of buſineſs, their quality ſhould <lb/>be ſtrictly examined. Families ought to <lb/>brew and
        bake for their own uſe; as the <lb/>grand object of the venders is to render the
        <lb/>liquors intoxicating, and the bread to pleaſe <lb/>the eye, rather than to conſult the
        health of <lb/>the conſumers. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Diet ought to be ſuited to the <w part="I">man-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >ner</w> of life. A ſedentary or ſtudious <w part="I">per-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſon</w>
        ſhould live more ſparingly than one <lb/>who labours hard without doors. Many <lb/>kinds of
        food will nouriſh a peaſant very <lb/>well, which would be almoſt indigeſtible <lb/>to a
        citizen; and the latter will live upon <lb/>a diet on which the former would ſtarve. </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_6" n="6"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>It is the opinion of an eminent <w part="I">Phyſi-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >cian</w> that faſting, reſt, and drinking water, <lb/>will cure moſt diſeaſes; for
        faſting gives time <lb/>to the ſtomach to unload itſelf of the <lb/>cauſe of diſtempers, the
        cauſe of all diſeaſes <lb/>being begun in that bowel only; to the <lb/>cleanſing of which,
        drinking plentifully of <lb/>water will much contribute. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>With the aſſiſtance of freſh air, and the <lb/>above means, the
        following caſe was <w part="I">ef-</w><lb/><w part="F">fected</w>: "A neighbour of mine
        became very <lb/>feveriſh, and his wife perſuaded him to <lb/>go to bed. I heard of it ſoon
        after, and <lb/>gave him a viſit, where I found the <w part="I">win-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >dows</w> cloſe ſhut, the curtains of the bed <lb/>drawn, and the room very hot, for it
        was in <lb/>the month of July: he was burning hot, <lb/>and complained for want of breath. I
        <lb/>drew open the curtains, covered him <lb/>warm, and then opened the windows, and
        <lb/>the wind blew into the room; upon which <lb/>he ſoon told me his ſhortneſs of breath
        had <lb/>left him. I perſuaded him to drink ſome <lb/>water, which he found did much refreſh
        <lb/>him; and, after I had taken my leave of <lb/>him, he called for more water; and, while
        <lb/>he had the cup in his hand, the apothecary <lb/>came in, whom his wife had ſent for,
        who, <pb xml:id="page_7" n="7"/><lb/>finding him about to drink the water, told <lb/>him if
        he did do it he was a dead man; <lb/>but, inſtead of forbearing, he drank it up <lb/>in his
        preſence: upon which the <w part="I">apothe-</w><lb/><w part="F">cary</w> took his leave,
        and told him he would <lb/>ſay no more to him. However, before <lb/>night, the perſon got
        up, went abroad, and <lb/>was cured of his fever. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>That there is a poſſibility of curing <w part="I">diſ-</w><lb/><w
          part="F">eaſes</w> by a diet only that is temperate and <lb/>cooling, ſuch as milk, and
        the roots and <lb/>ſeeds of vegetables, viz. potatoes, turnips, <lb/>wheat, rice, barley,
        oatmeal, and full-ripe <lb/>fruit, let the following remarkable inſtance, <lb/>teſtified by
        Dr. Cheyne, evince: A <w part="I">phyſi-</w><lb/><w part="F">cian</w> that lived at Croyden,
        who had long <lb/>been afflicted with the falling-evil, by ſlow <lb/>obſervation, found,
        that the lighter his meals <lb/>were, the lighter were his fits. At laſt he <lb/>alſo caſt
        off all liquids but water, and found <lb/>his fits weaker, and the intervals longer;
        <lb/>and finding his diſeaſe mend, as its fewel <lb/>was withdrawn, he took to vegetable
        food, <lb/>and water only, which put an entire period <lb/>to his fits, without any relapſe;
        but <w part="I">find-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> that food windy to him, he took to
        <lb/>milk, of which he eat a pint for a breakfaſt, <lb/>a quart at dinner, and a pint for
        ſupper, <pb xml:id="page_8" n="8"/><lb/>without fiſh, fleſh, bread, or any ſtrong or
        <lb/>ſpiritous liquor, or any drink but water, <lb/>with which he lived afterwards for a <w
          part="I">num-</w><lb/><w part="F">ber</w> of years, without the leaſt interruption <lb/>in
        his health, ſtrength, or vigour. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Temperance or ſpare diet, void of <w part="I">dain-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >ties</w>, never was injurious to the ſtrongeſt <lb/>conſtitution, and, without it, ſuch
        as are <lb/>weak and ſickly, cannot long exiſt; for <lb/>the more ſuch perſons eat and
        drink, the <lb/>more weak and diſordered they will ſtill <lb/>find themſelves to be. It is
        cuſtom only <lb/>that makes men hanker after gluttony and <lb/>drunkenneſs, and a contrary
        cuſtom will <lb/>make men abhor it as much. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Temperance will enable the rich to live <lb/>more at eaſe, and enjoy
        their wealth the <lb/>longer, being the ſureſt way to prolong <lb/>life, though it hath not
        the power to make <lb/>thoſe young who are aged; but it will <lb/>make the aged more free
        from <w part="I">decrepid-</w><lb/><w part="F">ness</w>, and die with more caſe, if the <w
          part="I">death-</w><lb/><w part="F">bed</w> hath been well prepared for by a good
