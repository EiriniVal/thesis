        <lb/>Hiſtory of an Obſtinate Swelling of the Knee, <lb/>terminating in Recovery. By Dr <hi
          rend="roman">George Mac- <lb/>farquhar Lawſon</hi>, of Montego Bay, Jamaica. </head>
      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi> MAN, aged 23, of a healthy and ro- <lb/>buſt conſtitution,
        plethoric habit, and <lb/>dark complexion, had, for a week or two, <lb/>complained of a
        diſagreeable ſenſation in the <lb/>joint of the right knee, about its centre. <lb/>The knee
        became rapidly and conſiderably <lb/>ſwelled, and the leg gradually waſted. His
        <lb/>appetite and health declined. He knew no <lb/>cauſe whatever to which his complaint
        could <lb/>be attributed. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>A practitioner adviſed him to keep a cloth <lb/>wet with vegeto-mineral water,
        conſtantly ap- <lb/>plied to his knee, and to throw cold water up- <lb/>on it every morning
        and evening. Finding <lb/>no relief, he applied to me on the firſt of Fe- <lb/>bruary. I
        immediately concluded it to be a <pb n="343"/>
        <lb/>rheumatic white ſwelling. Pain had now ta- <lb/>ken place. It felt as if deep-ſeated,
        and was <lb/>very ſevere, extending along the tendinous <lb/>expanſions of the muſcles
        connected with the <lb/>joint. It was much increaſed by motion, par- <lb/>ticularly by
        flexion or extenſion. The ſkin <lb/>had a ſhining appearance. A bliſter was ap- <lb/>plied
        on each ſide of the patella, leaving the <lb/>top unbliſtered, with a view to ſcarification;
        <lb/>which, however, he declined. A few cool- <lb/>ing and laxative medicines were given, as
        he <lb/>was coſtive; and one of the following pow- <lb/>ders every morning and evening: </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>℞ Antimonii crudi drachmam unam. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Opii puriſſimi gr. vi. M. &amp; divid. in <lb/>doſ. vi. Mercurial friction of the thigh
        of <lb/>the ſame ſide, was carried ſo far as to affect <lb/>the mouth; and he took daily ſix
        drams of <lb/>powdered Sarſaparilla. On the 27th of Fe- <lb/>bruary, the antimonial powders
        were omitted; <lb/>and next day, I had a conſultation with Dr <lb/>Murray, an eminent
        phyſician here. We di- <lb/>rected for him the following pills. ℞ Ex- <lb/>tracti foliorum
        Cicutæ, Calomelanos, utriuſque <lb/>grana xiv. Extracti Thebaici gr. vii. Mucil. <lb/>Gum.
        Arab. q. s. fiat maſſa divida in pil. xiv. <pb n="344"/>
        <lb/>quarum duæ mane et veſpere ſumendæ. Mer- <lb/>curial friction was laid aſide: he had
        for common <lb/>drink, a decoction of guaiacum. The bliſters <lb/>were kept open, and the
        ſarſaparilla conti- <lb/>nued. A ſeton was alſo introduced below <lb/>the knee. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The extract of cicuta was gradually in- <lb/>creaſed till the 13th of April, when he
        be- <lb/>came affected with headach, ſtupor, and other <lb/>ſymptoms often ariſing from
        cicuta. This <lb/>article was therefore omitted; but calomel <lb/>and opium were continued
        till the 29th of <lb/>April, when his knee was much reduced in <lb/>ſize, being hardly
        larger than the ſound one, <lb/>and without pain. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The bliſter, which had hitherto been kept <lb/>open, was now healed up; the pills were
        <lb/>laid aſide, and no medicines were taken, <lb/>but two drams of the ſarſaparilla daily,
        and <lb/>a ſmall quantity of the guaiacum decoction. <lb/>The ſeton was kept open, and
        affuſions of <lb/>cold water to the knee, were uſed every <lb/>morning and evening. Gentle
        friction with <lb/>camphorated oil, was alſo frequently repeat- <lb/>ed, and continued for
        half an hour each <pb n="345"/>
        <lb/>time. On the 6th of May, he began to <lb/>take five grains of the ſal Martis daily;
        but, <lb/>on the 14th of June, he left off all medicines, <lb/>being then reſtored to the
        perfect uſe and <lb/>ſtrength of his knee. He now goes about <lb/>his uſual buſineſs, which
        is a laborious one, <lb/>without the leaſt impediment. </p>
