        Whytt</hi>, M. D. F. R. S. <lb/>Fellow of the Royal College of Phyſicians, <lb/>and

        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi>S I had occaſion, ſeveral years ſince, <lb/>to write ſome
        obſervations on the <lb/>many diſorders occaſioned by an irregu- <lb/>lar or imperfect gout,
        in order to illuſtrate <lb/>another ſubject with which I thought it <lb/>a good deal
        connected, I have, ſince that <lb/>time, been particularly attentive to that <lb/>matter,
        and have formed ſo much the ſame <lb/>opinion with Dr Clerk of the effects of <lb/>the <hi
          rend="italic">arthritis anomala</hi>, that, in one ſenſe, <lb/>at leaſt, I am the moſt
        unfit of any in <pb n="467"/>
        <lb/>the ſociety to make remarks on his pa- <lb/>per; becauſe ſeveral objections may not
        <lb/>occur to me, that would preſent them- <lb/>ſelves to one of a different way of think-
        <lb/>ing. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="sc">In</hi> confirmation of what the Doctor <lb/>has ſaid of the gout being a
        more fre- <lb/>quent diſtemper among young perſons <lb/>than commonly is imagined, it may be
        <lb/>proper to mention, I had for my patient, <lb/>in November laſt, a girl of ſeventeen,
        <lb/>of a delicate make, who, at that time, <lb/>had a regular, and very ſmart fit of
        <lb/>the gout in one of her great toes, and in <lb/>one of her knees. In march laſt, ſhe had
        <lb/>a return of the ſame diſeaſe, although not <lb/>ſo highly marked but it might have been
        <lb/>taken for a rheumatiſm. Her wriſts were <lb/>only ſwelled; but, before this happened,
        <lb/>her ſtomach and breathing had been <lb/>greatly affected. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="sc">Besides</hi> the more common ſymptoms <lb/>occaſioned by an irregular
        gout, I have <lb/>met with the following; viz. a diabetes, <lb/>or an uncommon flux of pale
        urine conti- <pb n="468"/>
        <lb/>nuing for two or three weeks, a hemi- <lb/>plegia, a mania, palpitation of the heart,
        <lb/>a troubleſome itching of the ſcrotum, a <lb/>dyſuria, a running from the urethra, and
        <lb/>a pain in the teſticles. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I had a patient who never in his life <lb/>had been affected with any venereal diſ-
        <lb/>eaſe, who, for ſeveral years, had a ſmall <lb/>running from the urethra, which often
        <lb/>ſtopped for ſome weeks or months, and <lb/>then returned. As this perſon had once
        <lb/>had a fit of the true gout, and had many <lb/>ſymptoms which beſpoke the <hi
          rend="italic">arthritis <lb/>anomala</hi>, I was of opinion, that the run- <lb/>ning was
        occaſioned by the arthritic hu- <lb/>mour falling particularly on the nerves <lb/>or veſſels
        of the urethra; whence the mo- <lb/>tion of the fluids in them muſt have been
        <lb/>increaſed, and conſequently, the ſecretion <lb/>from the nervous organs muſt have been
        <lb/>more copious than uſual. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I have met with three caſes of a pain <lb/>in the teſticles from an arthritic cauſe.
        <lb/>In one of theſe, the left teſticle was much <lb/>ſwelled; but this ſwelling went off,
        upon <pb n="469"/>
        <lb/>a regular fit of the gout coming into <lb/>both the feet and both the hands. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="sc">In</hi> page 444. Dr Clerk mentions it as a <lb/>ſingularity of the
        arthritic ſtrangury, <lb/>that it is not increaſed, but removed, by <lb/>bliſters applied to
        the ancles. I have ſe- <lb/>veral times obſerved the ſame thing of a <lb/>ſlight ſtrangury
        in continued fevers. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="sc">With</hi> regard to the anti-arthritic vir- <lb/>tues of the tanſy, I can
        ſay nothing from <lb/>my own experience. As to the extract <lb/>of the cicuta; after taking
        it conſtantly <lb/>for three months, for a glandular ſwelling, <lb/>I was obliged to give it
        up on account of <lb/>a faintneſs at ſtomach, flatulence, and o- <lb/>ther complaints
        attacking me, which, <lb/>from experience, I know to be owing to <lb/>the gout. This ſeems
        to ſhew, that the <lb/>cicuta has no conſpicuous anti-arthritic <lb/>powers. Neither can
        lime-water be look- <lb/>ed on as poſſeſſed of this property; for <lb/>I had, ſome years
        ſince, a patient, ex- <lb/>tremely temperate, who, after having, for <lb/>three years
        running, drunk an Engliſh <lb/>quart of lime-water daily, had a very ſe- <pb n="470"/>
        <lb/>vere and long continued fit of the gout <lb/>in both his feet and both his hands.
        <lb/>The lime-water ſeems to have done ſer- <lb/>vice to Dr Clerk's patient, chiefly by pur-
        <lb/>ging him; and this is the more probable, <lb/>as he is one of a very full habit of bo-
        <lb/>dy. </p>
