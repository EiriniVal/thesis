        <lb/>Driburg Waters, had recommended, <lb/>in a general way, the uſe of the warm-bath
        <lb/>in nervous fevers. It did not occur to him, <lb/>that he had ſaid any thing new, or
        requiring <lb/>more full elucidation, until he read that part <lb/>of Dr Marcard's Work upon
        bathing, in <lb/>which he doubts its propriety, and even con- <lb/>demns its uſe in ſuch
        caſes. This firſt exited <lb/>our author to pay the ſubject more particu- <lb/>lar
        attention, and to expoſe more fully the <lb/>grouds of his opinion. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the winter of 1785, the ſlow nervous <pb n="74"/>
        <lb/>fever was frequent in Goettingen, often <lb/>complicated with gaſtric, bilious, and pi-
        <lb/>tuitous ſymptoms. In general, however, <lb/>there were no evident or certain
        remiſſions, <lb/>and the ſenſorium was eſpecally affected. <lb/>An obtuſe pain in the back
        of the head, pecu- <lb/>liar weakneſs and dullneſs, or preternatural <lb/>ſenſibility of the
        organs of ſenſe, a ſmall, ir- <lb/>regular, often little accelerated pulſe, deject-
        <lb/>edneſs, crude, quite clear, or ſometimes na- <lb/>tural urine, watchfulneſs, or great
        inclination <lb/>to ſleep without refreſhment, purging with- <lb/>out relief, were, during
        the firſt ten or twelve <lb/>days, in general the chief complaints of the <lb/>patient, who
        could frequently remain ſtill <lb/>out of bed. The ſenſorium became gra- <lb/>dually more
        affected; want of memory, apa- <lb/>thy, and light delirium, ſucceeded; and the <lb/>diſeaſe
        often terminated in the fifth or ſixth <lb/>week, commonly atteded with convulſions. <lb/>A
        young phyſician died thus in the ſixth <lb/>week; another, who in company with our
        <lb/>author opened his body, was seized with <lb/>ſimilar ſymptons. He had been already
        <lb/>eight days ill when Dr Brandis firſt ſaw <lb/>him: his ſituation was very critical; the
          <pb n="75"/>
        <lb/>ſenſorium was remarkably affected, extraor- <lb/>dinary dejection alternated with
        ſlight deli- <lb/>rium; the pulſe was ſmall, irregular, and <lb/>very quick, no evident
        remiſſion was to be <lb/>obſerved, nor any marks of acceſſions. Bli- <lb/>ſters had been
        applied to his legs, and he <lb/>uſed internally wine, camphor, and bark. <lb/>Theſe
        ſtimulating remedies ſeemed to affect <lb/>the ſenſorium ſtill more; the delirium in-
        <lb/>creaſed, and all the other ſymptoms grew <lb/>worſe. The lukewarm-bath was now order-
        <lb/>ed, the other remedies were omitted, and <lb/>ſp. mindereri was preſcribed, with weak
        <lb/>warm wine and water, for his drink. The <lb/>effect of the firſt bath was ſtrikingly
        benefi- <lb/>cial. After he had remained in it half an <lb/>hour, the deliriun and anxiety
        diminiſhed, <lb/>and he declared it did him good, and would <lb/>certainly ſave him. The
        bath was continued <lb/>eight or ten days. He recovered gradually, <lb/>and was at laſt
        completely cured. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In Hildeſheim, in the winter 1789, a ſimi- <lb/>lar diſeaſe was epidemic. Dr Brandis
        em- <lb/>ployed his remedy, wherever it could be <lb/>uſed, and with conſtant ſucceſs. He
        attend- <lb/>ed a ſhop-boy, who was ſeized with this <pb n="76"/>
        <lb/>ſlow nervous fever, accompanied by a ſuc- <lb/>ceſſion of anomalous ſymptoms, all, how-
        <lb/>ever, referable to a peculiar affection of the <lb/>ſenſorium. In the third week,
        univerſal <lb/>apathy, ſtupor, and delirium, came on. Du- <lb/>ring three weeks every remedy
        was tried; <lb/>wine and ether were given in large doſes, <lb/>but in vain; the bath alone,
        on account of <lb/>the local ſituation of the patient, could not <lb/>be uſed, and he died
        in the middle of the <lb/>eighth week. Immediately thereafter, a <lb/>young woman in the
        ſame houſe was at- <lb/>tacted. The ſymptoms were in the very <lb/>beginning more violent.
        Inſuperable me- <lb/>lancholy and depreſſion, with violent pain <lb/>in the back of her
        head, ſlight remitting fe- <lb/>ver, &amp;c. confined her to bed in eight or <lb/>ten days,
        and dreadful apathy came on <lb/>as early as the thirteenth day. In this caſe, <lb/>Dr
        Brandis overcame all difficulties, and on <lb/>the fifteenth or ſixteenth day the patient
        <lb/>was placed in the warm-bath. The ex- <lb/>pected ſucceſs followd, the delirium dimi-
        <lb/>niſhed, the diſeaſe declined without any ob- <lb/>vious criſis, and in four weeks was
        quite <lb/>removed. The reconvaleſcence was, how- <pb n="77"/>
        <lb/>ever, extremely ſlow, and the total loſs of <lb/>hair ſhewed how violent the diſeaſe
        had <lb/>been. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In February 1798, Dr Brandis was con- <lb/>ſulted on account of a young merchant. He
        <lb/>had been three weeks ill, and treated partly <lb/>with ſlightly evacuating, partly with
        ſtimu- <lb/>lating remedies. Family-diſtreſs prevented <lb/>our author from viſiting the
        patient, and he <lb/>only recommended the uſe of the warm- <lb/>bath in a general way. The
        attending phy- <lb/>ſician had, however, no confidence in it, and <lb/>did not uſe it.
        Fourteen days afterwards, <lb/>Dr Brandis was again called in, and found <lb/>the patient
        given over by the former phyſi- <lb/>cian. He lay quite inſenſible, paſſed his <lb/>ſtools
        and urine involuntarily, he was ſlightly <lb/>delirious, conſtantly muttering or making va-
        <lb/>rious geſticulations with his hands; his <lb/>pulſe was ſmall and frequent, <hi
          rend="italic">ſubſultus tendi- <lb/>num</hi> was almoſt conſtant, and his tongue <lb/>was
        quite dry, of a bright red colour, with- <lb/>out any incruſtration. He frequently brought
        <lb/>up, by coughing, thin frothy blood. The <lb/>diſeaſe had now continued five weeks; eva-
        <lb/>cuating and exciting remedies had been freely <pb n="78"/>
        <lb/>uſed, and recourſe had been long had to <lb/>ſtrong doſes of wine and muſk. Our author,
        <lb/>even in this ſituation, did not heſitate to or- <lb/>der the warm-bath; he truſted in
        it as a <lb/>powerful antiſpaſmodic, and its uſe was now <lb/>agreed to. The very firſt bath
        produced <lb/>evident relief, which encouraged them to <lb/>continue its uſe ſteadily. The
        patient no <lb/>longer brought up blood by coughing, and <lb/>his ſtools were leſs frequent,
        and not without <lb/>his being ſenſible of them. In eight days he <lb/>was evidently better,
        and in about three weeks <lb/>perfectly recovered. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The principal effect of the warm bath in <lb/>fevers is good in general, ſince it takes
        off <lb/>the ſpaſm of the ſkin, and thoſe parts ſym- <lb/>pathiſing with it increaſes the
        excretion by <lb/>the ſkin, promotes the flow of blood through <lb/>its veſſels, and
        moderates the action of the <lb/>nervous ſyſtem, but without in any way di- <lb/>miniſhing
        the vital power or irritability. <lb/>Such, ſays our author, is the opinion of <lb/>Cullen,
        Selle, and of Marcard himſelf, where <lb/>he proves, that the warm bath does not debi-
        <lb/>litate.According to our author, he ſeems <lb/>to have been miſled merely by the pheno-
        <lb/>menon which both of them, as well as Mar- <pb n="79"/>
        <lb/>teau, have obſerved, that in the bath the <lb/>pulſe often falls ſixteen or twenty
        beats in a <lb/>minute. Dr Marcard aſcribed this to a dimi- <lb/>nution of the vital
        principle; our author ex- <lb/>plains it otherwiſe. A freer circulation in <lb/> the ſmall
        veſſels of the ſurface, muſt, ſays <lb/>he, diminiſh the flow of blood to the heart;
        <lb/>now the ſtimulus, which excites the heart to <lb/>action, being leſs, its contractions
        become <lb/>leſs frequent, though without the ſmalleſt <lb/>diminution of the vital
        principle. Hence <lb/>Dr Brandis thinks the warm bath not ad- <lb/>miſſible in thoſe fevers
        where the cauſe lies <lb/>in the <hi rend="italic">primæ viæ</hi>, until that be removed,
        and <lb/>only in putrid fevers when the criſis takes <lb/>place by the ſkin, nor in
        inflammatory <lb/>fevers, when the vital principle muſt be di- <lb/>miniſhed, which is
        contrary to the action of <lb/>the warm bath; although he believes, with <lb/>De la
        Verniere, that it may be uſeful as an <lb/>aſſiſtant remedy, particularly in inflamma-
        <lb/>tion of the inteſtines, on account of the ſym- <lb/>pathy between theſe and ſkin. An
        ir- <lb/>ritable melancholy man became obſtinately <lb/>conſtipated. His phyſician, thinking
        conſti- <pb n="80"/>
        <lb/>pation muſt be removed by purgatives, gave <lb/>at firſt neutral ſalts freely, then
        jalap, and <lb/>at laſt, one morning, half a ſcruple of calomel, <lb/>with frequent clyſters
        of vinegar and water, <lb/>and next morning a whole drachm of diagry- <lb/>dium ſulphuratum.
        Conſtant vomiting, a <lb/>ſmall hard pulſe, and violent pain in the <lb/>belly, now came on,
        and the phyſician had <lb/>reſolved to venture every thing, as he ſaid, <lb/>and to make the
        patient ſwallow half a pound <lb/>of pure quickſilver, when Dr Brandis was <lb/>called in.
        Lukewarm-bathing, bleeding, <lb/>opiates, and the application of a bliſter to <lb/>the
        belly, effected a cure. In thoſe fevers in <lb/>which the ſolids particulary ſuffer, our au-
        <lb/>thor thinks the warm-bath muſt be eſpecially <lb/>uſeful. For confirmation, he refers
        to Cul- <lb/>len, Richter, and Selle; and concludes with <lb/>joining Marcard, in
        recommending it in <lb/>malaria, ariſing, in warm countries, from <lb/>marſh miaſma; and in
        ſmall-pox, where <lb/>violent fever and ſpaſm of the ſkin is preſent. </p>
