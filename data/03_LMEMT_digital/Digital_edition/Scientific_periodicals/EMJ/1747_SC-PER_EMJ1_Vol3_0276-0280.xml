        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">M</hi>R. <hi rend="italic">James Ure</hi>, whoſe Buſineſs as a Writer,
        <lb/>or Solicitor at Law, engaged him fre- <lb/>quently in Company and good Fellowſhip, was
        <lb/>ſometimes troubled with a Palpitation at his <lb/>Heart, a trembling in his Hand, and
        Faintneſs, <lb/>being always ſubject to a Cough, and having <lb/>generally very little
        Appetite for Food, with <lb/>two or three looſe Stools a-day. In <hi rend="italic"
          >October</hi>
        <lb/>1730, the fifty fifth Year of his Age, having <lb/>catched Cold, a Cough ſeized him,
        with which <lb/>he brought up a ſmall Quantity of very thick <lb/>Slime, and complained of a
        Difficulty of brea- <lb/>thing; he loſt all Appetite for Food, and his <lb/>Belly became
        bound; his Urine was in ſmall <lb/>Quantity, and he could not feel his own Pulſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>He allowed theſe Symptoms to continue eight <lb/>Days without asking any Advice; but
        finding <lb/>them continue, and rather increaſe, he conſult- <lb/>ed Dr. <hi rend="italic"
          >William Porterfield</hi> and me, <hi rend="italic">October</hi> 20th. <lb/>Beſides the
        above mentioned Symptoms, we <lb/>obſerved his Difficulty of breathing increaſe ſo <lb/>much
        upon lying down, that he was obliged to <lb/>ſleep in a ſitting Poſture. His Feet and Legs
        <lb/>were very oedematous. We could feel no Pulſe <lb/>in the Arteries of his Wriſt, Neck,
        Temples <lb/>or Ham, but only a ſort of trembling under <lb/>our Fingers, which we then
        attributed to ſome <lb/>Irregularity in the Diſtribution of his Arteries, <pb n="277"/>
        <lb/>notwithſtanding his affirming, that, when in <lb/>Health, he had a pretty ſtrong Pulſe
        in the ve- <lb/>ry Parts we felt. The Veins of his Arm and <lb/>Neck were very large, and
        ſtretched with <lb/>Blood. He could take no ſort of Food, but <lb/>had a Thirſt, which was
        not violent, nor was <lb/>his Tongue dry, or his Skin hot. When the <lb/>Cough attacked him,
        he forced very little Pi- <lb/>tuit up; but his Breathing became exceeding <lb/>laborious,
        his Face turned very red or Purple, <lb/>and he complained of a violent Headach. When
        <lb/>he was free of the Cough a little while, he <lb/>walked, ſpoke, complained of little,
        and aſ- <lb/>ſured us he was ſcarce weaker than in Health. <lb/>To prevent the bad Effects
        of the Cough, twelve <lb/>Ounces of Blood were immediately let; he bled <lb/>freely, and did
        not turn faint. In the Even- <lb/>ing a <hi rend="italic">Terebinthinat</hi> purging Clyſter
        was inject- <lb/>ed, which purged him gently. He was deſired <lb/>to take any ſort of mild
        Food which his Sto- <lb/>mach could receive. <hi rend="italic">Rheniſh</hi> Wine and Wa-
        <lb/>ter were given for Drink, into which he fre- <lb/>quently dropped forty Gutts of the
        following <lb/>Mixture, ℞. <hi rend="italic">Elixir, Pectoral. Unc. <hi rend="roman">l.</hi>

          <hi rend="italic">Oxymel Pectoral.</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Edin- <lb/>burgh</hi>
        Diſpenſatory. At Bed-time he took this <lb/><hi rend="italic">Bolus</hi>. ℞. <hi

        <lb/>Next Morning there appeared no Change in <lb/>his Condition; and he took <hi

        <lb/>ach or Difficulty of Breathing, and brought a <lb/>good deal of Slime with the Water he
        drank. <lb/>He ſeemed a little relieved after this Vomit, <lb/>and continued the Uſe of the
        Medicines pre- <lb/>ſcribed the Day before. At Night a bliſtering <lb/>Plaiſter was applied
        to his Neck and Shoulders; <lb/>he took his <hi rend="italic">Bolus</hi>, and had a cooling
        Emulſion <lb/>for Drink. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The Bliſter roſe well, but the Pain of it <lb/>made him ſo unable to move next Morning,
        <lb/>that we could not give the Purgative we had <lb/>determined to order. His Urine was in
        larger <lb/>Quantity, with a good Sediment; notwith- <lb/>ſtanding which, his Legs were
        rather more <lb/>ſwelled, and the other Symptoms continued. <lb/>His <hi rend="italic"
          >Bolus</hi> was again given in the Morning; he <lb/>ſtill drank Water with <hi
          rend="italic">Rheniſh</hi> Wine; and he <lb/>was deſired to take frequently a Spoonful of
        the <lb/>following Mixture, ℞. <hi rend="italic">Aq. Hyſſop. Puleg. a. <lb/>Unc. <hi

        <lb/>He continued much in the ſame Way all the <lb/>22d and 23d, only his Legs and Thighs
        ſwel- <lb/>led more; and he began to complain that his <lb/>Clothes were too tight for his
        Belly. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the Morning of the 24th he took this pur- <lb/>gative <hi rend="italic">Bolus</hi>,
        ℞. <hi rend="italic">Pulv. Rhei elect. Scrup. <hi rend="roman">i.</hi> A- <lb/>quil. alb.

        <lb/>This purged him mildly, and the Quantity of <lb/>his Urine increaſed conſiderably, and
        his Bel- <lb/>ly and Legs became leſs ſwelled, which re- <lb/>lieved him ſomewhat of the <hi
          rend="italic">Orthopnea</hi>. </p>
      <pb n="279"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Next Day he began to uſe a medicated Wine, <lb/>℞. <hi rend="italic">Rad. Irid.

        with a <lb/>large Sediment; the Swellings diminiſhed, and <lb/>his Cough and Breathing were
        eaſier. In the <lb/>Evening of the 26th, while I ſat by him, he <lb/>ſurpriſed me with
        putting his Wriſt into my <lb/>Hand to feel his Pulſe, which was full, ſtrong, <lb/>ſlow and
        equal; but two Hours after, I could <lb/>again feel no more than the very weak trem-
        <lb/>bling I formerly mentioned. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The 27th the purgative <hi rend="italic">Bolus</hi> was repeated. <lb/>On the 28th, his
        Pulſe returned, and conti- <lb/>nued afterwards firm and ſtrong, till he reco- <lb/>vered
        his former Health, which he did in a <lb/>little Time, by the Uſe of the medicated Wine,
        <lb/>pectoral Mixture, and the Purgative ſometimes <lb/>repeted. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>About a Month after, having got the Cold <lb/>again, his Symptoms began to return with
        the <lb/>ſame State of his Pulſe; but upon taking the <lb/>former Emetick, and the
        Purgative, they went <lb/>off; and to prevent a ſecond Relapſe, he got <lb/>ſtrengthning
        chalybeat Medicines, with the ſti- <lb/>mulating Gums for ſome Time. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the Beginning of <hi rend="italic">January</hi> 1732, he was <lb/>again attacked
        with the <hi rend="italic">Aſthma</hi>, and want of <pb n="280"/>
        <lb/>Pulſe; which were removed with two Doſes of <lb/>the Purgative. After a Cough which
        conti- <lb/>nued ſome Days in the Beginning of <hi rend="italic">February</hi>; <lb/>his
        Pulſe could not be felt during twenty four <lb/>Hours, but it returned after the Operation
        of a <lb/>purgative <hi rend="italic">Bolus</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Soon after my Patient retired to the Coun- <lb/>try, where he has continued in very
        good <lb/>Health; and being lately in Town, reviſed <lb/>this Account of his Caſe, and
        allowed me to <lb/>communicate it to you. </p>
