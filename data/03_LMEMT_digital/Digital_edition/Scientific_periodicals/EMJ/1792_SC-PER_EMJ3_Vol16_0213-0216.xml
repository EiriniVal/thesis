        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>HE paper before us contains different <lb/>caſes, in which
        ſurpriſing good effects <lb/>were derived from the external application of <lb/>Camphor.
        And, if the ſame benefit ſhall <lb/>be derived from it in ſimilar caſes, its intro-
        <lb/>duction, in this manner, may juſtly be conſi- <lb/>dered as a diſcovery of great
        importance in <lb/>the practice of medicine. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the firſt caſe which Mr Latham relates, <lb/>the patient was a gentleman upwards of
        70 <lb/>years of age, thin, and of a delicate conſtitu- <lb/>tion, but tolerably healthy,
        temperate in his <lb/>diet, and uſed moderate exerciſe. On the <lb/>10th of November, he had
        been caught in the <pb n="214"/>
        <lb/>rain while on horſeback; and, on the follow- <lb/>ing day, had ſome uneaſineſs in
        making wa- <lb/>ter, but not much greater than he had often <lb/>before experienced; as, for
        ſome years before, <lb/>he had not been able to retain his urine, for <lb/>any conſiderable
        length of time, without in- <lb/>convenience. On the 14th, a total retention <lb/>of urine
        took place, attended with violent and <lb/>painful efforts to void it, a quick pulſe, and
        <lb/>ſome degree of thirſt. From that time, it <lb/>was always neceſſary to draw off his
        water by <lb/>means of a catheter; although, in the mean <lb/>time, ſeveral plans of
        treatment were adopt- <lb/>ed. Bleeding, evacuating the bowels with <lb/>ol. ricini, and the
        uſe of the ſemicupium, were <lb/>changed for bark, and the application of <lb/>cloths dipped
        in cold water to the pubis. It <lb/>was ſoon, however, neceſſary to return to the <lb/>firſt
        mode of treatment, on account of the in- <lb/>creaſed irritation, and marks of inflammation.
        <lb/>Muſk, in large doſes, was next employed, but <lb/>without advantage. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Mr Latham, having read of the good ef- <lb/>fects of the external application of
        Camphor in <lb/>ſtranguries, and having obſerved, that its ap- <lb/>plication produced a
        more copious flow of u- <pb n="215"/>
        <lb/>rine than uſual, and likewiſe recollecting, that <lb/>it is ſometimes employed to
        counteract the ir- <lb/>ritation of cantharides on the urinary organs, <lb/>thought that it
        might poſſibly be of uſe in <lb/>this caſe. Accordingly, on the ſecond appli- <lb/>cation of
        a liniment, prepared of oil of al- <lb/>monds, with as much camphor as could be diſ-
        <lb/>ſolved in it, which was to be uſed every four <lb/>hours, the patient voided about half
        an ounce <lb/>of urine, and continued to void it, in lar- <lb/>ger quantities, from time to
        time, till the <lb/>22d. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The uſe of the catheter (which had been <lb/>introduced ſixty-ſeven times) was now no
        <lb/>longer neceſſary; and, by proper remedies, <lb/>and a reſtorative diet, the patient
        recovered his <lb/>uſual ſtrength; nor had he afterwards any re- <lb/>turn of this
        complaint. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Mr Latham relates another caſe, the ſub- <lb/>ject of which was a poor woman, of a
        delicate <lb/>conſtitution, who had been ſeized with a re- <lb/>tention of urine, in
        conſequence of expoſure <lb/>to cold. In this caſe, alſo, the camphorated <lb/>liniment
        ſucceeded, after the failure of ſe- <lb/>veral other remedies. He concludes this pa- <pb
          n="216"/>
        <lb/>per with obſerving, that, in two inſtances of <lb/>retention of urine, after difficult
        labours, <lb/>which continued longer than uſual, he had <lb/>applied camphor externally,
        with the deſired <lb/>ſucceſs. </p>
