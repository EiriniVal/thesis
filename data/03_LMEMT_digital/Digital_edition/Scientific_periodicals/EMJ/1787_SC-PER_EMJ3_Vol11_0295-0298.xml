        <lb/>The Hiſtory of a Caſe of Univerſal Latent Can- <lb/>cer. By <hi rend="roman">Dr Richard
          Kentiſh phyſician at <lb/>Huntingdon</hi>. </head>
      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>
        <hi rend="sc">Have</hi> lately had a very ſingular caſe of <lb/><hi rend="italic">univerſal
          latent cancer</hi>. Mrs K—g, a <lb/>maiden lady, aged 64, had long been troubled <lb/>with
        pains in the hip, thighs, back, and other <lb/>parts of the body. Theſe were treated as ner-
        <lb/>vous ſpaſms. She took immenſe quantities of <lb/>bark; uſed ſea-bathing; but found her
        com- <lb/>plaints aggravated. She was the patient of an <lb/>eminent phyſician at Cambridge. </p>
      <pb n="296"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Her pains became ſo violent, and her ema- <lb/>ciation ſo great, that ſhe was not
        expected to <lb/>live many days, when I was deſired to viſit <lb/>her. I found her a perfect
        ſkeleton. She had <lb/>a great degree of hectic fever, but no one <lb/>ſymptom of nervous
        debility. On inquiry, I <lb/>found that ſhe had ſuffered amputation of a <lb/>cancerous
        breaſt about two years before the <lb/>commencement of her preſent complaints. She <lb/>had
        a ſmall tumour on the lower maxilla, <lb/>which, on examination, appeared to me an
        <lb/>exoſtoſis: She had likewiſe ſmall tumours of <lb/>the ſame nature on the os frontis;
        and ſhe <lb/>complained of a ſtiffneſs in the neck, which, <lb/>ſhe ſaid, certainly aroſe
        from a ſudden turn of <lb/>her head in bed: but I found a ſmall glandu- <lb/>lar tumour in
        this place. What will appear <lb/>rather extraordinary, is, that my patient care- <lb/>fully
        concealed ſeveral other tumours, which, <lb/>at my future viſits, were obſerved. The in-
        <lb/>guinal glands were conſiderably enlarged, and <lb/>the whole occiput filled with
        exoſtoſes of va- <lb/>rious ſizes; the maxillary glands were diſ- <lb/>eaſed, and above the
        left clavicle were knotty <lb/>ſwellings as large as ſmall nutmegs. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>No diſeaſe appeared near the ſeat of the ex- <pb n="297"/>
        <lb/>tirpated mamma: but the ribs on that ſide, <lb/>together with the ſternum, were
        protruded; <lb/>and the glands under the adjoining axilla were <lb/>enlarged. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I put my patient on a courſe of cicuta, to <lb/>which I joined merc. calc. to the
        extent of a <lb/>quarter of a grain daily. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>She appeared to receive beneſit: the tu- <lb/>mour on the chin leſſened. But one
        morning, <lb/>as ſhe was turning round, her thigh-bone <lb/>cracked, and was one of the
        completeſt frac- <lb/>tures which I ever ſaw. Mr Mackie (the <lb/>ſurgeon) ſaid the ends
        felt gritty, like diſeaſed <lb/>bone. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>From this period, my patient grew daily <lb/>weaker and weaker: She continued her me-
        <lb/>dicines; and took to the amount of eighteen <lb/>grains or one ſcruple of the extr.
        cicutæ every <lb/>night, with an anodyne draught. The merc. <lb/>calc. was occaſionally
        omitted and repeated: <lb/>She had a decoction of Peruvian bark and ſar- <lb/>ſaparilla,
        which was ſeldom omitted; but, at <lb/>the end of about three months from the time <lb/>I
        firſt viſited her, ſhe died. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>On examination, almoſt every gland appear- <lb/>ed diſeaſed; and I have no doubt that
        the <pb n="298"/>
        <lb/>bones were all affected with cancer. A callus <lb/>ſeemed to have been imperfectly
        formed; but <lb/>ſhe did not live long enough after the frac- <lb/>ture for the formation of
        a proper union. </p>
