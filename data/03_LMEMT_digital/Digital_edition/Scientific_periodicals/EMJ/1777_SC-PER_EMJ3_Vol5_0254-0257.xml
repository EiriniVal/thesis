        <lb/>Account of the Treatment of Bilious Remitting Fe- <lb/>vers in the Military Hoſpitals
        at Martinico in <lb/>the year 1761, in a Letter from Dr <hi rend="roman">George

      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">W</hi>HILE Dr Monro remained with the <lb/>military hoſpitals at
        Martinico during <lb/>the late war, a great number of the ſoldiers were <lb/>taken ill of a
        bilious fever, which appeared to be <lb/>ſomewhat of the bilious autumnal kind, but of
        <lb/>a much more malignant nature, we are informed, <lb/>than any to be met with in Europe.
        The bowels <lb/>were commonly filled with a very putrid bile and <lb/>other liquors; and the
        preſervation of the life of <lb/>the patient depended, in a great meaſure, on eva-
        <lb/>cuating ſpeedily and ſafely theſe corrupted hu- <lb/>mours with which the primae viae
        were loaded. </p>
      <pb n="255"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>On the firſt attack of the fever bleeding was <lb/>found neceſſary; but, if it was
        delayed till the firſt <lb/>ſymptoms were over, it was then found to be <lb/>hurtful, except
        under particular circumſtances; <lb/>and it was therefore commonly omitted. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When this fever was attended with a burning <lb/>heat, a fulneſs and beating at the
        temples, when <lb/>the eyes were turgid and full, as if preſſed out of <lb/>the head, when
        there occurred intolerable ſickneſs, <lb/>nauſea, and pain of the ſtomach, and when it gave
        <lb/>the patient excruciating torture to preſs with the <lb/>hand on the ſtomach, the taking
        away ſeven or <lb/>eight ounces of blood was of ſervice. After this, <lb/>it was neceſſary
        to keep almoſt perpetually <lb/>fomenting the ſtomach, and frequently to re- <lb/>peat
        emollient clyſters till the body was open- <lb/>ed, and then to give once, twice, or thrice,
        at <lb/>the interval of ſome hours, a ſolution of one, <lb/>two, or three grains of tartar
        emetic, and an <lb/>ounce of manna in water, to puke the patient <lb/>freely, and afterwards
        to give it in ſmall quan- <lb/>tities, ſo as to keep the belly looſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When the ſtomach was much oppreſſed, with- <lb/>out any violent inflammatory ſymptom,
        then <lb/>bleeding was omitted. But the fomentations <lb/>were aſſiduouſly applied to the
        ſtomach, and the <pb n="256"/>
        <lb/>belly was kept open by the help of clyſters, and <lb/>then three, four, or five grains
        of tartar emetic <lb/>were given by way of an emetic, and repeated <lb/>once or oftner, if
        required. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>After the emetic had operated freely, then <lb/>ſmall doſes of a ſolution of manna and
        of tartar <lb/>emetic were given, ſo as to operate freely by <lb/>ſtool, at the ſame time
        that emollient clyſters <lb/>were frequently repeated. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When the bowels were thus well emptied, the <lb/>fever either went off, or an
        intermiſſion was pro- <lb/>cured; at which period, it was neceſſary to give <lb/>the bark
        freely. An ounce in the twenty-four <lb/>hours commonly put an effectual ſtop to the fe-
        <lb/>ver, though ſmall doſes had no effect whatever. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When the ſtomach proved ſo irritable as not <lb/>to bear the bark in proper doſes,
        opiates were <lb/>given with great advantage, both in procuring <lb/>reſt, and in enabling
        the ſtomach to retain the <lb/>bark. Small doſes of opium, however, had no <lb/>effect. It
        was neceſſary, therefore, to give a <lb/>large one, and ſometimes to repeat it before the
        <lb/>end propoſed was procured. It muſt be remark- <lb/>ed, too, that opiates, when given
        before the ſto- <lb/>mach and bowels were thoroughly cleaned, al- <pb n="257"/>
        <lb/>ways made the patient reſtleſs and uneaſy, and, in <lb/>general, were ſoon thrown up
        again. Upon the <lb/>whole, the principal points to be attended to in <lb/>our author's
        practice in this diſease, are, as we have <lb/>already remarked, a thorough cleaning of the
        <lb/>primae viae, both by vomits and purgatives, to- <lb/>gether with a continued uſe of
        warm fomenta- <lb/>tions to the ſtomach, and afterwards, when an <lb/>intermiſſion appears,
        a free uſe of the bark. </p>
