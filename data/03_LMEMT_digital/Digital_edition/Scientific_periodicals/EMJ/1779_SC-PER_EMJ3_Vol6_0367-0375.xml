            depends upon <lb/>the degrees of bitterneſs or of aſtringency <lb/>poſſeſſed by them;
            for here, the curſuta, and <lb/>willow, were both found leſs antiſeptic than

            <lb/>In ſome of the northern kingdoms, li- <lb/>chen, we are told, is uſed not only as a
            me- <lb/>dicine, but as an article of diet; and from <lb/>the mild nutritive qualities
            of which it is evi- <lb/>dently poſſeſſed, our author thinks we may <lb/>account for the
            good effects which have lately <lb/>been ſaid to be derived from it in conſump-
            <lb/>tive diſorders, and which have been confirmed <lb/>by the teſtimony of many of the
            moſt accu- <lb/>rate obſervers. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>As the moſt agreeable and convenient form <lb/>of uſing it, he recommends it firſt
            to be in- <lb/>fuſed in boiling water, with a view to its being <lb/>thoroughly cleaned,
            while by the ſame means <lb/>it will be deprived of a conſiderable part of <lb/>its
            original bitterneſs. The lichen, thus pre- <lb/>pared, is ordered to be boiled, and the
            muci- <lb/>lage ſo obtained from it, to be uſed either as <lb/>an article of diet or as
            a medicine; and we <lb/>have it in our power, we are told, to render it <lb/>exceedingly
            palatable, by the addition of a lit- <lb/>tle white wine, when that can with propriety
            <lb/>be given; or when wine is not admiſſible, by <lb/>the addition either of milk,
            honey, or ſyrup <lb/>of lemons. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>It is recommended particularly, in all kinds <lb/>of cough; and in caſes of
            emaciation, from <lb/>whatever cauſe they may have ariſen. </p>
