          <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">S</hi><hi rend="sc">Everal</hi> years ago a doctrine was introduced
          <lb/>to the world, by the late celebrated Haller <lb/>and his diſciples, tending to prove,
          that the tendons, <lb/>perioſteum, dura mater, and ſome other <lb/>membranous parts, are
          all deſtitute of ſenſation. <lb/>Various anſwers have been publiſhed to this opi-
          <lb/>nion; but as the Work now before us enters <lb/>more fully upon this inveſtigation
          than any we <lb/>have met with, and as the Author's ideas are all <lb/>ſupported by a
          ſeries of well conducted experi- <lb/>ments, we ſhall therefore give a particular detail
            <pb n="17"/>
          <lb/>of ſuch of theſe as appear to be moſt conclu- <lb/>ſive. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>This Work is divided into four ſections: The <lb/>firſt is entitled, De tendinibus;
          the ſecond, De <lb/>perioſteo &amp; pericranio; the third, De dura &amp; <lb/>pia matre;

          <lb/>A middle ſized dog was the ſubject of the firſt <lb/>of theſe experiments; which was
          performed, we <lb/>are told, in the preſence of Profeſſor M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Niven,
          <lb/>and ſeveral other Members of the Univerſity. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The animal being properly ſecured, the ſkin <lb/>was cut, in a longitudinal
          direction, along the <lb/>courſe of the tendo Achillis. During this inci- <lb/>ſion, the
          dog appeared to be in very great pain; <lb/>it was obſerved, however, that although he did
          <lb/>not complain, either upon puncturing or cutting <lb/>off a piece of ſkin previouſly
          ſeparated from the <lb/>parts below, yet that the pain was conſtantly re- <lb/>newed, on
          attempting to diſſect a portion of ſkin <lb/>not yet detached from the contiguous parts. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The tendon with its ſheath being now laid <lb/>bare, a very ſlight degree of
          irritation with a <pb n="18"/>
          <lb/>needle, was found to produce a great degree of <lb/>pain; but leaſt any fallacy might
          occur from the <lb/>tendon ſtill remaining covered with its vagina, <lb/>it was at laſt
          perfectly denuded, when the ſame <lb/>degree of irritation was attended with the ſame
          <lb/>effect as before. A needle being puſhed into <lb/>the ſubſtance of the tendon,
          evidently occaſioned <lb/>very ſevere pain; and the needle being allowed <lb/>to remain
          there for ſome time, it was afterwards <lb/>found, in withdrawing it, that the animal com-
          <lb/>plained ſeverely on its being in the leaſt degree <lb/>moved. Violent ſigns of pain,
          too, occurred on <lb/>dividing, even with a cutting inſtrument, a few <lb/>of the fibres
          of this tendon. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>In the eighth experiment on this ſubject, the <lb/>tendon of one of the muſcles in
          the leg of a horſe <lb/>was laid entirely bare; and it was uniformly <lb/>obſerved, that
          on puncturing the tendon with a <lb/>needle the animal made violent exertions, in
          <lb/>order to extricate himſelf from his confinement. <lb/>The ſame degree of feeling,
          however, did not <lb/>ſeem to occur from cutting off a ſlice entirely <lb/>from any
          portion of the tendon. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>In experiment ninth, the external oblique <lb/>muſcle of the abdomen in a dog was
          laid bare; <lb/>and, on the application of oil of vitriol to the <pb n="19"/>
          <lb/>aponeuroſis of that muſcle, only a ſlight degree <lb/>of uneaſineſs ſeemed to enſue;
          but the animal <lb/>appeared evidently to ſuffer the moſt violent <lb/>pain, either from
          preſſing theſe two parts be- <lb/>tween two ſharp bodies, or from puncturing <lb/>them
          with a lancet. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>In the twelfth and laſt experiment of this <lb/>ſection, which we mean to
          communicate, there <lb/>is related the caſe of a ſoldier, whoſe hand had <lb/>been ſo
          ſeverely cut as to induce over the whole <lb/>of it a tedious dangerous ſuppuration; and
          on <lb/>the matter being evacuated, ſome of the tendons <lb/>of the fingers, particularly
          theſe of the perforans <lb/>and perforatus muſcles, were laid entirely bare. <lb/>In this
          caſe, we are told, the ſenſibility of ten- <lb/>dons appeared to be great indeed; for
          although <lb/>the patient was of a robuſt conſtitution, yet if <lb/>by accident, at any of
          the dreſſings, theſe ten- <lb/>dons happened to be touched by the probe, even <lb/>in the
          moſt gentle manner, the moſt violent pain, <lb/>to ſuch a degree almoſt as to induce
          fainting, <lb/>was inſtantaneouſly produced. From theſe, and <lb/>various other
          experiments on the ſame ſubject, <lb/>no doubt, our Author thinks, can remain of ten-
          <lb/>dons being poſſeſſed of a very conſiderable de- <lb/>gree of ſenſibility. </p>

          <lb/><hi rend="sc">Experiment I.</hi> A middle ſized dog <lb/>being properly ſecured, the
          teguments of the <lb/>thorax were diſſected off, leaving the ribs cover- <lb/>ed with the
          perioſteum only. On beginning to <lb/>ſeparate the perioſteum from the bone, the dog
          <lb/>complained ſeverely: he became again quiet on <lb/>deſiſting from the operation; but
          a very violent <lb/>degree of pain ſeemed always to be induced, <lb/>ſo ſoon as the
          ſcalpel was again applied to the <lb/>perioſteum. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/><hi rend="sc">Experiment II.</hi> The ſame experi- <lb/>ment with the foregoing was
          put in practice <lb/>with a horſe, and the reſult was exactly ſimilar, <lb/>the horſe
          always exhibiting certain ſigns of his <lb/>ſuffering ſeverely, as ſoon as any attempt was
          <lb/>made upon the perioſteum. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/><hi rend="sc">Experiment III.</hi> The pericranium <lb/>of a dog being denuded of the
          common tegu- <lb/>ments, the animal complained ſlightly on any <lb/>attempt being made to
          irritate that membrane <lb/>with a lancet. On touching it with lapis infer- <lb/>nalis, a
          more ſevere degree of pain ſeemed to <lb/>enſue; but the moſt violent torture was indu-
          <lb/>ced by the application of a ſingle drop of oil <pb n="21"/>
          <lb/>of vitriol. The pericranium being rubbed with <lb/>a ſponge immerſed in cold water,
          likewiſe cre- <lb/>ated a great degree of pain. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/><hi rend="sc">Experiment IV.</hi> The perioſteum in <lb/>the leg of a dog being laid
          perfectly bare, by <lb/>diſſecting off the common teguments, muſcles, <lb/>and tendons, a
          very violent degree of pain was <lb/>found to be induced, by endeavouring to ſepa-
          <lb/>rate the perioſteum from the bone. This was <lb/>likewiſe the caſe by applying butter
          of antimony <lb/>to the ſurface of that membrane. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/><hi rend="sc">Experiments V.</hi> and <hi rend="sc">VI.</hi> being all <lb/>that were
          made upon this ſubject, tended to <lb/>ſhew evidently, that the perioſteum is poſſeſſed
          <lb/>of a very conſiderable degree of ſenſibility. In- <lb/>dependently of the reſult of
          theſe experiments, <lb/>by which the ſenſibility of the perioſteum ap- <lb/>pears to be
          conſiderable, the idea, our Author <lb/>obſerves, is ſufficiently confirmed, merely by the
          <lb/>common and well known effect which inflam- <lb/>mation always produces on that
          membrane; no <lb/>part of the body, when in an inflamed ſtate, be- <lb/>ing attended with
          more exquiſite pain than the <lb/>perioſteum. </p>

          <lb/>a ſcalpel, and ſome degree of pain was thereby <lb/>produced; but a more evident and

          ſenſibility, and, as <lb/>he ſuppoſes the pia mater to be equally well fur- <lb/>niſhed

          peritonæum was thus laid bare; and as ſoon <lb/>as the animal had recovered from the
          fright he <lb/>had been put into, the peritonæum was ſlightly <lb/>touched with a piece of
          timber wet with oil of <lb/>vitriol. He inſtantly thereafter began to breathe <lb/>and
          moan ſo ſtrongly, that a rupture was pro- <lb/>duced in the peritonæum, at which all the
          inte- <lb/>ſtines were immediately protruded. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/><hi rend="sc">Experiment V.</hi> The ſame experiment <lb/>with the preceding being
          repeated, not only in a <lb/>dog, but in other animals, was uniformly found <lb/>to be
          attended with a ſimilar reſult. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Our Author however acknowledges, that theſe <lb/>experiments upon the peritonæum were
          by no <pb n="25"/>
          <lb/>means ſo concluſive as thoſe upon the pleura and <lb/>other parts before related; for
          this membrane <lb/>being ſo very thin and delicate as to burſt very <lb/>ſoon after the
          application of the cauſtic, its effects <lb/>were thereby rendered leſs obvious than
          other- <lb/>wiſe they probably might have been. Upon the <lb/>whole, however, he
          concludes, that the tendons, <lb/>perioſteum, pericranium, dura mater, and pleura,
          <lb/>appear evidently to poſſeſs a very conſiderable <lb/>degree of ſenſibility. </p>
