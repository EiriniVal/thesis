      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>HE author of this diſſertation is already <lb/>well known to the
        learned world, from ha- <lb/>ving produced ſo great a degree of artificial cold <lb/>as to
        congeal quick-ſilver. In the eſſay now be- <lb/>fore us, he ſets out with obſerving, that
        the ex- <lb/>tremes of heat and cold are entirely incapable of <lb/>being meaſured. He adds,
        that different bodies <lb/>in nature vary much with regard to the degree of <lb/>heat they
        poſſeſs, but that living bodies, indepen- <lb/>dent of their heat, as particles of matter,
        have <lb/>an additional heat. This heat, he obſerves, is <lb/>much varied in different
        animals; but, for mea- <lb/>ſuring all the varieties which occur in it, no other
        <lb/>inſtrument is neceſſary, but a common thermo- <lb/>meter. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Our author, after mentioning that the ther- <lb/>mometer which he employed, was that of
        De <lb/><unclear>L'Iſle</unclear>, but that he has reduced all his obſerva- <lb/>tions to
        the correſpondent degrees in Fahrenheit's <lb/>ſcale, as being more generally known, points
          <pb n="60"/>
        <lb/>out ſeveral cautions which are neceſſary for <lb/>accurate obſervations; particularly,
        that the ther- <lb/>mometer be kept applied for a ſufficient length <lb/>of time; and that,
        in examining the heighth to <lb/>which the mercury has ariſen, the eye be kept
        <lb/>horizontal to it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>With theſe precautions, he found that the heat <lb/>of the human body is about 97½ or
        98 degrees <lb/>of Fahrenheit's thermometer; and that this heat <lb/>is nearly the ſame in
        all ages and ſexes. Upon <lb/>examining the heat of a calf, both by immerſing <lb/>the
        thermometer into blood newly drawn, and by <lb/>introducing it into an aperture of the
        abdomen, <lb/>he found it at 104 degrees of Fahrenheit's ther- <lb/>mometer. The heat of a
        pig he found to be the <lb/>ſame with the calf, and that of a goat at 101 de- <lb/>grees. A
        thermometer placed between the <lb/>thighs of a dog, pointed at 100 or 101; to this <lb/>he
        thinks two ſhould be added, as the difference <lb/>betwixt the heat of ſurface, and that of
        the viſce- <lb/>ra, which makes the heat of dogs 102 degrees. <lb/>From theſe experiments it
        appears, that the heat <lb/>of the human ſpecies was leſs than that of any <lb/>quadruped
        which he examined; but that even <lb/>the difference between the extremes was not <lb/>very
        conſiderable. </p>
      <pb n="61"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Among birds, he found greater exceſs above <lb/>the heat of the human body. The heat in
        the <lb/>abdomen of a gooſe he found to be 107¾. It <lb/>was the ſame in cocks, hens, ducks,
        pidgeons, <lb/>peacocks, pheaſants, and ſome others. In ſmaller <lb/>birds, he found the
        heat 111 degrees. From <lb/>theſe experiments it appears, that birds differ <lb/>very little
        from each other in point of heat; but <lb/>that all of them conſiderably exceed the human
        <lb/>body. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Upon examining a variety of thoſe fiſhes which <lb/>have gills in place of lungs, Mr
        Braun found, that <lb/>they had no heat peculiar to themſelves, but ſoon <lb/>aſſumed the
        temperature of the medium in which <lb/>they were kept, even when immerſed in water, <lb/>of
        very different degrees of heat. But thoſe fiſh- <lb/>es which have lungs, he found,
        poſſeſſed nearly <lb/>the ſame degree of heat as quadrupeds. To the <lb/>animals wanting
        native heat he alſo refers, frogs, <lb/>inſects, and thoſe animals which ſleep during the
        <lb/>winter, while they remain in a torpid ſtate. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Having related theſe obſervations reſpecting <lb/>the heat of men and other animals in
        a ſtate of <lb/>health, our author proceeds to obſerve, that in <lb/>both it is greatly
        varied by diſeaſe. In fevers, he <lb/>has in general obſerved the heat to be at 105, <pb
          n="62"/>
        <lb/>6, 7, or 8 degrees in Fahrenheit's thermometer; <lb/>and, even in the cold fit of
        fevers, two or three <lb/>degrees above the natural ſtandard. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The author next proceeds to inquire what de- <lb/>gree of heat and cold men are capable
        of bear- <lb/>ing. Upon this ſubject, he concludes, that the <lb/>limits compatible with
        life are much diverſified <lb/>from cuſtom and other circumſtances. He tells <lb/>us that
        Richman in his baths could bear the heat <lb/>at 125 degrees. That the common heat of the
        <lb/>Ruſſian baths is 106½, and the greateſt 116 de- <lb/>grees; that dogs, when incloſed in
        baths, die at <lb/>different degrees of heat, at 115, 120, and 146; <lb/>that fiſhes die at
        111 degrees, though with that <lb/>heat frogs ſtill ſurvive. A ſparrow, he tells us,
        <lb/>died in ſeven minutes when kept in a heat of <lb/>146 degrees. Birds of paſſage,
        according to our <lb/>author, are able to bear extremes of cold; and <lb/>inſects, extremes
        both of heat and cold. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Having related theſe obſervations, our author <lb/>concludes the preſent eſſay with an
        inquiry con- <lb/>cerning the theory of animal heat. He exa- <lb/>mines particularly the
        opinions which ſuppoſe it <lb/>owing to fermentation, electricity, and friction. <lb/>The
        two former he rejects as hypothetical and <lb/>unſatisfactory, and thinks it may with
        juſtice be <lb/>referred to the laſt. </p>
