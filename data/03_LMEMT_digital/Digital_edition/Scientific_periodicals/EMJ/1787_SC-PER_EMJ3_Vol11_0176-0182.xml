        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>HOUGH from the account given in this <lb/>paper it would appear
        that Dr Martin <lb/>can hardly be conſidered in any other light <lb/>than that of an
        empyric, yet the reputation <lb/>which his noſtrum acquired was ſuch as juſtly <lb/>to claim
        the attention of Dr Ruſh. And when <lb/>we reflect that the inventions, and even the
        <lb/>temerity of quacks, has given birth to ſome <lb/>of the moſt important improvements in
        medi- <lb/>cine, ſuch inveſtigations cannot be thought un- <lb/>worthy of the inquiries of
        the philoſophical and <lb/>benevolent phyſician. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr Martin had been for ſome time a regi- <lb/>mental ſurgeon, ſtationed in the back
        parts of <lb/>Penſylvania, at Fort Pitt. And his advertiſe- <pb n="177"/>
        <lb/>ments bore, that he was able to cure cancer, by <lb/>a medicine which he had diſcovered
        in the <lb/>woods in the neighbourhood of that garriſon. <lb/>After his medicine had gained
        conſiderable cre- <lb/>dit in Philadelphia, Dr Ruſh took the liberty of <lb/>waiting upon
        him, and of aſking him ſome queſ- <lb/>tions reſpecting his diſcovery. The anſwers he
        <lb/>gave were calculated to make Dr Ruſh believe <lb/>that his medicine was of a vegetable
        nature, <lb/>and that it was originally an Indian remedy. <lb/>He ſhewed ſome of it, which
        appeared to be the <lb/>powder of a well-dried root of ſome kind; and <lb/>he admitted Dr
        Ruſh to ſee him apply it in two <lb/>or three caſes. In ſome inſtances, Dr Martin
        <lb/>applied a powder to the parts affected. In o- <lb/>thers, he only touched them with a
        feather, dip- <lb/>ped in a liquid which had a white ſediment, and <lb/>from which Dr Ruſh
        inferred that it was a ve- <lb/>getable root diffuſed in water. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The effects reſulting from theſe applications <lb/>were very conſiderable; and Dr Ruſh
        witneſſed <lb/>their efficacy in ſeveral inſtances. In ſome <lb/>cancerous ulcers, the cures
        he performed were <lb/>complete: but where the cancers were much <lb/>connected with the
        lymphatic ſyſtem, or ac- <lb/>companied with a ſcrophulous habit of body, his <pb n="178"/>
        <lb/>medicine always failed, and in ſome inſtances <lb/>did evident miſchief. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr Ruſh was anxious to diſcover a medicine <lb/>which promiſed relief, even in a few
        caſes of <lb/>cancer. As he obſerved that the effects of Dr <lb/>Martin's powder ſhewed it
        to be of an acrid na- <lb/>ture, and as he ſuppoſed all cauſtic vegetables <lb/>to be nearly
        the ſame, he had recourſe to dif- <lb/>ferent ones. He tried in a ſimilar manner the
        <lb/>phytolacca, the ſtramonium, the arum, and ſome <lb/>others, in hopes of ſeeing from
        them the ſame <lb/>effects as from Dr Martin's powder. But in <lb/>theſe he was
        diſappointed. They gave pain, <lb/>but they performed no cures. He was after- <lb/>wards
        furniſhed with a powder by a gentleman <lb/>from Fort Pitt, which, from a variety of circum-
        <lb/>ſtances, he inferred to be of the ſame kind with <lb/>that uſed by Dr Martin. He
        applied this to a <lb/>fungous ulcer, but it did not produce that de- <lb/>gree of pain,
        inflammation, and diſcharge, <lb/>which he had been accuſtomed to ſee from the
        <lb/>application of Dr Martin's powder. After this, <lb/>he ſhould probably, he tells us,
        have ſuſpected <lb/>that the powder was not formed from a ſimple <lb/>root, had not Dr
        Martin, upon all occaſions, <lb/>continued to aſſure him that it was wholly a <lb/>vegetable
        preparation. </p>
      <pb n="179"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr Martin died in the year 1784; and, a few <lb/>weeks after his death, Dr Ruſh
        procured from <lb/>one of his adminiſtrators a few ounces of the <lb/>powder, with the view
        of examining it minute- <lb/>ly. Upon throwing the powder, which was of <lb/>a brown colour,
        upon a piece white paper, he <lb/>could diſtinctly perceive a number of white <lb/>particles
        ſcattered thro' it. He at firſt ſuſpected <lb/>that theſe were corroſive ſublimate, but the
        uſual <lb/>teſts of that metallic ſalt ſoon convinced him that <lb/>he was miſtaken.
        Reflecting that arſenic was the <lb/>baſis of moſt of the celebrated cancer-powders
        <lb/>that have been uſed in the world, he had next <lb/>recourſe to the teſts for detecting
        it. Upon <lb/>ſprinkling a ſmall quantity of the powder on live <lb/>coals, it emitted the
        ſmell of garlic, a well known <lb/>teſt of arſenic, ſo perceptibly, as to be known <lb/>by
        ſeveral perſons whom he called into the <lb/>room where he made the experiment, and who
        <lb/>knew nothing of the object of his inquiries. As <lb/>a ſecond teſt, he picked out from
        the powder <lb/>three or four grains of the white particles; theſe <lb/>he bound between two
        pieces of copper, which <lb/>he threw into the fire. After the pieces of cop- <lb/>per
        became red hot, they were taken out; and, <lb/>when they were cooled, it appeared that an
        evi- <pb n="180"/>
        <lb/>dent whiteneſs was imparted to both of them. <lb/>To theſe two he added ſtill a third
        teſt. He in- <lb/>fuſed a ſmall quantity of the powder in a ſolu- <lb/>tion of vegetable
        alkali in water, for a few <lb/>hours, and then poured it upon a ſolution of <lb/>blue
        vitriol in water. The colour of the vitriol <lb/>was immediately changed to a beautiful
        green, <lb/>and afterwards precipitated. From all theſe <lb/>teſts then, there could remain
        no doubt that <lb/>Dr Martin's powder contained a proportion of <lb/>arſenic, which probably
        was its active baſis. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr Ruſh concludes this paper with a few <lb/>remarks upon this powder, and upon the
        cure <lb/>of cancers and foul ulcers of all kinds. He <lb/>obſerves, that the uſe of
        cauſtics, in cancers <lb/>and foul ulcers, is a very ancient and univerſal <lb/>practice;
        and he believes arſenic to be the moſt <lb/>efficacious of any that has ever been uſed. The
        <lb/>great art of applying it ſucceſsfully, is to dilute <lb/>and mix it in ſuch a manner as
        to mitigate the <lb/>violence of its action; and he thinks Dr Mar- <lb/>tin's compoſition
        was happily calculated for this <lb/>purpoſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>He thinks that the arſenic uſed by Dr Mar- <lb/>tin was the pure white
            arſenic<unclear><hi rend="sup">r</hi></unclear>; and he conjec- <lb/>tures, that the
        proportion which it bore to the <pb n="181"/>
        <lb/>vegetable powder, could not be more than one <lb/>fortieth part of the compound. He
        thinks <lb/>that the vegetable matter, uſed in the powder <lb/>given to him, was the root
        and berries of the <lb/>ſolanum lethale. But he has reaſon to believe <lb/>that Dr Martin
        employed different vegetable <lb/>ſubſtances at different times. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>He is of opinion, that Dr Martin's want of <lb/>ſucceſs in many caſes aroſe from his
        uſing it <lb/>indiſcriminately in all caſes. He thinks, that <lb/>in ſchirrous and cancerous
        tumours, the knife <lb/>ſhould always be preferred to the cauſtic. And <lb/>in cancerous
        ulcers, attended with a ſcrophulous <lb/>habit of body, ſuch particularly as have their
        <lb/>ſeat in the breaſts of females, it can only, he <lb/>thinks, protract the patient's
        miſery. Moſt of <lb/>the cancers which Dr Martin cured by it were <lb/>ſeated on the noſe,
        or cheeks, or upon the ſur- <lb/>face or extremities of the body. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It is not, he tells us, in cancerous caſes only, <lb/>that Dr Martin's powder has been
        found to do <lb/>ſervice. He has ſeen this powder uſed with <lb/>advantage in ſores of all
        kinds, and from a va- <lb/>riety of cauſes, when they have been attended <lb/>with fungous
        fleſh, and callous edges. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Every one converſant in practice well knows <pb n="182"/>
        <lb/>that theſe affections, which this remedy is ſaid <lb/>to combat, are frequently of the
        moſt obſtinate <lb/>nature. And although, as Dr Ruſh juſtly re- <lb/>marks, we are not
        indiſcriminately to expect <lb/>from its uſe the cure of every cancer, yet if <lb/>it be
        attended with advantage in the caſes which <lb/>he has pointed out, the labour he has
        beſtowed <lb/>in the inveſtigation of it muſt be an acceptable <lb/>and important ſervice to
        the public. </p>
