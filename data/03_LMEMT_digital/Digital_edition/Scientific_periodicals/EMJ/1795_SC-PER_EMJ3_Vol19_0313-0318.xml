        <lb/>Account Of the pernicious Effects from an Im- <lb/>pregnation given to Water by Lead.
        Com- <lb/>municated to Dr <hi rend="roman">Duncan</hi> by <hi rend="roman">A. B.</hi> in the
        <lb/>Service of the Hon. Eaſt-India Company. </head>
      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi>S an account of the following unfortu- <lb/>nate circumtance,
        may perhaps in <lb/>ſome future period hinder a ſimilar accident <lb/>from taking place, I
        conſider it to be my <lb/>duty, as a member of the ſociety, to point out <lb/>an
        unqueſtionable inſtance of the pernicious <lb/>cuſtom of uſing any kind of drink which
        <lb/>has for a certain time been in contact with <lb/>lead. I myſelf, and ſeveral others,
        have <lb/>very nearly loſt our lives from this cauſe; <lb/>and perhaps the ſingularity of
        the accident <lb/>may render an account of it not unworthy a <lb/>place in your valuable
        collection. Of this, <lb/>however, you will be able to judge, from <lb/>peruſing the
        following narrative. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>About ten months ago, a ſmall packet ſet <lb/>ſail for India, and for ſome time had a
        very <pb n="134"/>
        <lb/>proſperous paſſage; but afterwards, in con- <lb/>ſequence of contrary winds, all hands
        were <lb/>obliged to be put upon an allowance of three <lb/>pints of water <hi rend="italic"
          >per</hi> day. The ſeamen kept <lb/>each their allowance ſeparately in bottles; <lb/>while
        the officers, on the other hand, were <lb/>ſo unfortunate as to put all their's into a
        <lb/>leaden ciſtern, with a ſtop-cock, which, as <lb/>in many other veſſels of the ſame
        kind, is <lb/>ſituated for this very purpoſe at the door of <lb/>the cabin. The conſequence
        of this was <lb/>dreadful indeed. In about three weeks <lb/>time, there was not one of the
        offi- <lb/>cers who was not affected with all the <lb/>ſymptoms of the Colica Pictonum in
        the <lb/>moſt violent degree. The colic, regularly, <lb/>morning and evening, became
        remarkably <lb/>aggravated; the pain all over the abdomen <lb/>was intenſe; and, along with
        the uſual ſpaſ- <lb/>modic affections in this diſeaſe, we had ſome- <lb/>times a <hi
          rend="italic">tendency</hi> to univerſal convulſions. <lb/>For nearly the ſpace of ſix
        weeks, almoſt no- <lb/>thing would remain even for a moment on <lb/>our ſtomachs, ſo that
        ſome of us were obli- <lb/>ged to have nouriſhing glyſters occaſionally. <lb/>After being
        about five weeks in this condi- <pb n="135"/>
        <lb/>tion, we arrived at St Helena, where we all <lb/>gradually recovered in the courſe of a
        few <lb/>weeks; though ſome of us have had very <lb/>ſevere relapſes of our complaint during
        our <lb/>return to England. For ſome time paſt, <lb/>too, we have been ſubject to weakneſs
        of <lb/>the back and ſuperior extremities, which has <lb/>now, however, totally diſappeared. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The above ſymptoms proceeded at ſeveral <lb/>times to ſuch an alarming pitch, and at
        laſt <lb/>reduced us ſo much, that, even upon making <lb/>land, two of us with the utmoſt
        difficulty <lb/>eſcaped with our lives. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Upon conſidering the matter for a mo- <lb/>ment, there cannot, I apprehend, be the
        <lb/>ſmalleſt doubt with reſpect to the cauſe of <lb/>the above ſymptoms. That they were
        occa- <lb/>ſioned, is proved not only from this circum- <lb/>ſtance, that every one of the
        officers who <lb/>lived upon the water contained in it was af- <lb/>fected, while not one of
        the ſeamen (who <lb/>all, as we have ſaid, kept their allowance <lb/>ſeperately) had the
        ſmalleſt complaint; but <lb/>alſo from the following experiment which I <lb/>made, to put
        the matter beyond a doubt. </p>
      <pb n="316"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Having filled two tumblers, one with pure <lb/>water, and the other with water from the
        <lb/>ciſtern, I poured into each of them a ſmall <lb/>portion of a ſolution of hepar
        ſulphuris; the <lb/>conſequence of which was, that the latter <lb/>was rendered very
        dark-coloured, while the <lb/>appearance of the other was hardly changed. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>How the water could become ſo impreg- <lb/>nated with lead, I ſhall not abſolutely pre-
        <lb/>tend to determine. Perhaps the ſmall quan- <lb/>tity of water might, in conſequence of
        the <lb/>motion of the veſſel, mechanically ſeperate <lb/>a ſmall portion of the metal: Or,
        not im- <lb/>probably, as it had been kept for ſeveral <lb/>weeks, it might take ſome
        portion of it up <lb/>by means of a chemical affinity. But in <lb/>whatever manner the above
        event might <lb/>happen, our unllucky caſe too clearly prov- <lb/>ed <hi rend="italic">that
          a portion of lead was contained in our <lb/>allowance of water</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I ſhall conclude what I have to ſay upon <lb/>this ſubject, with a few words upon the
        me- <lb/>thod of treatment in the above complaint. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>During the whole courſe of it, purgatives, <lb/>injections, and the ſemicupium, were
        almoſt <lb/>the only remedies we could depend upon. <pb n="317"/>
        <lb/>Opium, whether adminiſtered by the mouth <lb/>or anus, ought never to be exhibited pre-
        <lb/>vious to ſome purgative medicine; for in <lb/>the courſe of our complaint, I had an
        oppor- <lb/>tunity both of <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
          >obſerving</hi> that, by <lb/>following a contrary practice, the pain and <lb/>tenſion of
        the abdomen, the gripes, coſtive- <lb/>neſs, and in ſhort all the ſymptoms, were
        <lb/>uniformly aggravated. It will, however, in <lb/>ſome inſtances be neceſſary, after the
        opera- <lb/>tion of the purgative, nay ſometimes even <lb/>before it has begun to operate,
        to give a mo- <lb/>derate doſe of opium by the mouth or anus, <lb/>according to
        circumſtances. Opium, how- <lb/>ever, is a remedy which, I can freely ſay <lb/>from
        experience, ought to be uſed in this <lb/>complaint as ſparingly as poſſible, and with
        <lb/>the utmoſt precaution; for although it may <lb/>often remove, and even prevent the
        ſpaſms <lb/>of the inteſtines for the time, yet I have uni- <lb/>formly found, that it
        renders them much <lb/>more liable to return, than if no ſuch reme- <lb/>dy had been
        employed. What I found to <lb/>be of the greateſt ſervice in my caſe, was an <lb/>electuary,
        in which camphor and flowers of <lb/>ſulphur were the principal ingredients; this
        <lb/>remedy proving both an antiſpaſmodic and <pb n="318"/>
        <lb/>a laxative. Bleeding, too, was a remedy, <lb/>which, though unwillingly, I was under
        the <lb/>neceſſity of employing, in conſequence of <lb/>the repeated ſupervention of ſevere
        inflam- <lb/>matory ſymptoms. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As I know from undoubted authority, that <lb/>there are many veſſels which have leaden
        <lb/>ciſterns of the ſame kind with that which oc- <lb/>caſioned the above unfortunate
        accident; <lb/>and as perhaps at ſome future period a caſe <lb/>ſimilar to ours may not
        improbably again <lb/>take place; it may be worth while to publiſh <lb/>the foregoing
        account, by which at leaſt the <lb/><hi rend="italic">ſurgeons</hi> of ſuch veſſels may be
        put upon <lb/>their guard, and ſimilar cataſtrophes, if poſ- <lb/>ſible, prevented. Nay, it
        may even be at- <lb/>tended with beneficial effects on ſhore; for as <lb/>I am well informed
        that there are leaden <lb/>ciſterns, and even leaden utenſils, in uſe a- <lb/>mong many
        families in this kingdom, unfor- <lb/>tunate accidents cannot fail of ſometimes
        <lb/>happening. And I think that it is incumbent <lb/>upon every medical perſon to do what
        he <lb/>can in adviſing the abolition of every leaden <lb/>machine, with which the articles
        of our diet <lb/>may poſſibly come in contact. </p>
