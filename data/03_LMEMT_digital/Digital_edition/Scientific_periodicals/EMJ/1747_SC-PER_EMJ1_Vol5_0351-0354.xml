          <lb/><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="dc(1.5)">A</hi>Braham Pike</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
            >Crediton</hi>, in the County of <lb/><hi rend="italic">Devon</hi>, Chimney-ſweeper,
          aged about thir- <lb/>ty, had laboured under an <hi rend="italic">Hernia inteſtinalis</hi>
          <lb/>for ſeveral Years, which in the Beginning of <lb/><hi rend="italic">September</hi>
          1731 was increaſed to ſuch a Degree, <lb/>by overheaving himſelf in carrying Water to
          <lb/>help to extinguiſh a Fire that happened in the <lb/>Neighbourhood, that he could not
          reduce it as <lb/>uſual when in Bed. This Misfortune was im- <lb/>mediately aggravated by
          a total Strangulation <lb/>of the Inteſtine. The poor Man, through I- <lb/>gnorance and
          Want, ſuffered terrible Pains in <lb/>the Part for about a Fortnight, without ac-
          <lb/>quainting any Body with his late Misfortune <lb/>beſides his Wife, till, grown at
          laſt intolerable, <lb/>Dr. <hi rend="italic">Bent</hi> paſſing accidentally by, was
          deſired to <lb/>caſt an Eye upon him; who finding the Tu- <lb/>mor large, with great
          Inflammation tending to <lb/>a livid Colour, adviſed them to get a Surgeon, <lb/>whoſe
          Buſineſs it was, and in the interim to <lb/>apply a warm emollient Cataplaſm to it, which
          <lb/>was accordingly done. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>I was ſent for the next Morning, and upon <lb/>Examination found the Matter had
          penetrated <lb/>the Coats of the <hi rend="italic">Scrotum</hi>, diſcharging itſelf in <pb
            n="352"/>
          <lb/>great Quantity, with putrid Sloughs filling up <lb/>the whole Cavity, the greater
          Part of which I <lb/>cut off with my Sciſſars, contenting myſelf for <lb/>that Time to
          dreſs it up with a warm Dige- <lb/>ſtive, till I could provide myſelf with a Fomen-
          <lb/>tation and other Neceſſaries, as the Caſe requi- <lb/>red. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>At the next Dreſſing I found his Excrements, <lb/>which he had not diſcharged the
          natural Way <lb/>for above a Fortnight before, came off at the <lb/>Orifice in a large
          Quantity. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The whole Cavity of the Wound, which was <lb/>very large, was a Confuſion of Matter,
          Excre- <lb/>ment, rotten Gut, and mortified Membranes. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>I cut off at that Time above ſix Inches of the <lb/>Inteſtine, (all of which being
          fallen down into <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Scrotum</hi> was entirely ſphacelated) as alſo
          <lb/>above half the right Side of the <hi rend="italic">Scrotum</hi>. Ha- <lb/>ving waſh'd
          off the remaining <hi rend="italic">Sordes</hi> with ſome <lb/>of the Fomentation I had
          hot by me, I dreſs'd <lb/>it up with Pledgets ſpread with a Digeſtive, and <lb/>dipt in
          the ſame Liquor. This, nor any of the <lb/>ſucceeding Dreſſings, was attended with the
          <lb/>leaſt Hemorrhage, ſo that I ſuppoſe the <hi rend="italic">ſperma- <lb/>tic
            Veſſels</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Teſticle</hi> were likewiſe mor- <lb/>tified; for
          I could find neither of theſe upon <lb/>cleanſing away the ſtinking Sloughs that cover-
          <lb/>ed them, and I believe they came off together <lb/>with thoſe Sloughs, but in ſo
          rotten a State <lb/>that they could not be diſtinguiſhed one from <lb/>another. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>I continued on dreſſing it twice a Day; the <lb/>remaining Sloughs digeſted off, and
          the Wound <lb/>began to clean and look well; but ſtill the Ex- <lb/>crement, which ſhould
          have been diſcharged <pb n="353"/>
          <lb/>by the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>, came off at the new Paſſage: And <lb/>how indeed
          could we conceive it ſhould do o- <lb/>therwiſe, when ſo much of the whole <hi
            rend="italic">annular <lb/>Subſtance</hi> of the Gut had been cut off? </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Though I had always deſpaired of the Life of <lb/>my Patient, yet knowing Nature
          ſometimes <lb/>brings about her Ends in a miraculous Manner, <lb/>I was reſolved to aſſiſt
          to the utmoſt of my Pow- <lb/>er. I ordered frequent <hi rend="italic">Clyſters</hi> to be
          injected, <lb/>which brought away the indurated <hi rend="italic">Fæces</hi>, that
          <lb/>had lain a long while in the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, and by <lb/>continuing
          this Method for ſome time, the Diſ- <lb/>charge from the Wound every Day leſſened,
          <lb/>and he had frequent Stools from the natural <lb/>Paſſage. Thus our Cure went
          hopefully on, <lb/>and after above a Month's Obſtruction from his <lb/>firſt Confinement,
          Nature returned again into <lb/>its <hi rend="italic">former Channel</hi>. The Diſcharge
          at the <hi rend="italic">new <lb/>one</hi> gradually leſſening, till at laſt it perfectly
          <lb/>ſtopt, the Ulcer was incarned and cicatriced <lb/>with very little Trouble, and the
          Cure com- <lb/>pletely finiſhed without any further Obſtacle. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>As the Man is cured of his <hi rend="italic">Hernia</hi>, he is <lb/>now in a much
          better Condition than he was <lb/>before this Accident happened. He has been <lb/>very
          healthy ſince that Time, and follows his <lb/>Labour: He is grown fat, and looks better
          <lb/>than he did Years before. </p>

          extraordinary Caſe; a Parallel to which <lb/>I had not met with, nor read of, till I
