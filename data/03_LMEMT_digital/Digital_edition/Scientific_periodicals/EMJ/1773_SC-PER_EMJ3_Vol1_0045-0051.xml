        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>N this treatiſe Dr Meckel ſets out with ſome <lb/>obſervations
        on the opportunities which ſtill <lb/>remain of adding to our knowledge of the
        <lb/>ſtructure of the human body. He obſerves par- <lb/>ticularly, that the doctrine of
        ſecretion ſtill re- <lb/>mains involved in great uncertainty. And he <lb/>concludes his
        introduction with mentioning the <lb/>intention of the preſent work, which is, to point
        <lb/>out the different kinds of abſorption, and the pur- <lb/>poſes for which they are
        intended. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>After the preliminary obſervations, our au- <lb/>thor, in the firſt ſection, proceeds
        to treat of the <lb/>return of the lymph into the blood. Upon in- <lb/>jecting lymphatic
        veſſels with mercury, he has <lb/>often found it paſs into the red veins, without a- <pb
          n="46"/>
        <lb/>ny extravaſation; but the nature of the com- <lb/>munication he could not diſcover,
        till he hap- <lb/>pened to inject, by a lymphatic coming from the <lb/>pelvis, a gland
        partly ſchirrous. He there found <lb/>that mercury entered the ſound part of it very
        <lb/>readily; but, when it came to the ſchirrus, it was <lb/>obſtructed by a weight which
        ſupported eighteen <lb/>inches of mercury. By preſſure, however, he <lb/>forced the mercury
        into the ſmaller ducts of the <lb/>gland; and then ſaw it paſs through a vein from <lb/>the
        gland into the inferior cava. From this he <lb/>infers, that, when the body is in health,
        there is a <lb/>natural communication between the lymphatic <lb/>veſſels and the veins of
        conglobate glands; but <lb/>that this paſſage is much ſmaller than that into <lb/>the
        lymphatic above the gland. From this ſtruc- <lb/>ture our author deduces the following
        phyſiologi- <lb/>cal obſervations. He alledges, that, in order to <lb/>prepare every
        ſecreted liquor in the body, abſorp- <lb/>tion from the ſecreting organ is abſolutely ne-
        <lb/>ceſſary; and that, in the preparation of lymph, <lb/>this abſorption is performed by
        the veins. He <lb/>farther obſerves, that by this ſtructure the lymph <lb/>will be conveyed
        into the blood, when the lym- <lb/>phatics are either obſtructed or ruptured; and, <lb/>by
        this means, many diſeaſes will be prevented. </p>
      <pb n="47"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr Meckel, in the ſecond ſection, treats of ab- <lb/>ſorption taking place by means of
        the veins from <lb/>the mammae. He here gives an account of his <lb/>having injected with
        mercury, through the tubes of <lb/>the nipples, the breaſts of women, both ſoon be-
        <lb/>fore and ſoon after delivery. Upon injecting the <lb/>mamma of a woman ſoon after
        delivery, which ſtill <lb/>adhered to the muſcles of the thorax, the mercu- <lb/>ry, after
        having filled the gland, readily paſſed into <lb/>the veins of the mamma, and from thence
        into <lb/>the trunk of the axillary vein. Upon injecting the <lb/>breaſts of a woman who had
        died in labour, this <lb/>communication of the lactiferous tubes with the <lb/>veins was
        alſo <unclear>found</unclear>. But, by this injection, he <lb/>diſcovered another
        ſingularity, for, upon tying the <lb/>veins and the lactiferous tube at which he injected,
        <lb/>the mercury burſt through another lactiferous tube <lb/>of the nipple, and upon tying
        this, through a third, <lb/>more remote. From repeated trials in this man- <lb/>ner, he
        concludes, that the lactiferous tubes have <lb/>a communication with each other. In order to
        <lb/>prove that this anaſtomeſis takes place in the ex- <lb/>treme branches only of theſe
        tubes, our author <lb/>obſerves, 1<hi rend="italic">ſt</hi>, That the communication ſeems to
        <lb/>ſubſiſt equally between the neareſt and the moſt <lb/>diſtant branches. 2<hi
          rend="italic">dly</hi>, That he inſerted the tube <pb n="48"/>
        <lb/>into which he injected below the nipple. And, 3<hi rend="italic">dly</hi>, <lb/>That,
        after trying every means in his power, he <lb/>was never able to diſcover the lactiferous
        circle de- <lb/>ſcribed by Nuck. This communication of the <lb/>veins with the lactiferous
        tubes, our author ima- <lb/>gines, is neceſſary, both for the preparation of <lb/>the milk,
        and for its return into the blood in thoſe <lb/>who do not ſuckle. He obſerves, that, for
        the pre- <lb/>paration of milk, the lymphatics ſerve to carry off <lb/>the ſuperabundant
        aqueous parts of the blood, and <lb/>the veins the ſaline and earthy parts; ſo that no-
        <lb/>thing but the bland butyraceous part is left to paſs <lb/>through the lactiferous
        tubes. From this com- <lb/>munication alſo, he infers, that thoſe who have <lb/>aſcribed
        diſeaſes to the return of the milk into the <lb/>blood, have greatly erred. On the contrary,
        he <lb/>alledges that the abſorption of this bland fluid in- <lb/>to the blood, is not only
        natural, but even uſeful. <lb/>He farther obſerves, that, by this ſtructure, the re-
        <lb/>ſolution of obſtructions of every kind is greatly <lb/>facilitated; and that we ſhould
        endeavour, in every <lb/>caſe of the ſtagnation of milk, to promote its re- <lb/>turn
        through the veins by applications which tend <lb/>to relax them, and to increaſe the action
        of the <lb/>ſmall veſſels. </p>
      <pb n="49"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the third ſection, the author treats of the ab- <lb/>ſorption of ſemen from the
        veſiculae ſeminales. <lb/>Upon injecting the veſiculae ſeminales of a ſtout <lb/>man, after
        tying the ejaculatory tubes, he filled the <lb/>hypogaſtric vein, and the venous plexus
        ſurround- <lb/>ing the veſicles. Upon tracing the veins thus in- <lb/>jected, he found them
        ariſing from the cavity of <lb/>the veſicles. In this experiment, no lymphatic was
        <lb/>injected. Having repeated the experiment ſeve- <lb/>ral times, he found, for the moſt
        part, the ſame <lb/>appearances; but he acknowledges that he could <lb/>not inject the vein
        on every trial. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr Meckel alledges that this ſtructure is inten- <lb/>ded for the return of ſuch parts
        of the ſemen to <lb/>the blood, as he ſuppoſes are too viſcid to be <lb/>reabſorbed by the
        lymphatics. Hence he concludes, <lb/>that we need not be apprehenſive of an accumu-
        <lb/>lation of ſemen in the veſicles; and that, if this <lb/>complaint ſhould occur, it is
        to be obviated by <lb/>ſuch remedies as tend to facilitate the circulation, <lb/>and not by
        corroborants and aſtringents, which <lb/>might be ſuppoſed to promote abſorption. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr Meckel, in the fourth ſection, treats of the <lb/>influence of abſorption upon the
        bile. Having <lb/>frequently injected the lymphatics of the liver <lb/>through the biliary
        ducts, he adds, that by preſſing <pb n="50"/>
        <lb/>fluids ſtill farther, he has alſo injected the vena ca- <lb/>va. He could not, however,
        by any force, or by any <lb/>method, puſh his injection into the vena portarum, <lb/>or
        hepatic artery. After theſe injections, upon <lb/>examining the liver with the greateſt
        accuracy, <lb/>both with his naked eye and good glaſſes, he ne- <lb/>ver could diſcover any
        extravaſation. He farther <lb/>obſerves, that, when extravaſation took place, the
        <lb/>paſſage of the injection into the lymphatics and <lb/>veins was impeded. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This ſtructure, our author imagines, is intended <lb/>for carrying off the aqueous
        parts of the fluids, <lb/>that the bile may be prepared and perfected. From <lb/>this alſo,
        he accounts for the ready paſſage which <lb/>the bile finds into the blood, when the ductus
        cho- <lb/>ledichus is obſtructed, as happens in jaundice; and <lb/>for the yellow colour
        which happens in hydropic <lb/>caſes, as the bile is then more watery in its nature
        <lb/>than uſual. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The ſubject of the laſt ſection is the abſorption <lb/>which takes place from the
        bladder. Having en- <lb/>deavoured to inflate the bladder by the urethra, <lb/>our author
        found, that all the air paſſed through <lb/>the veſicular veins, and from thence into the
        trunk <lb/>of the hypogaſtrick veins. He alſo obſerved the ſame <lb/>appearances upon the
        injection of water. </p>
      <pb n="51"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As the bladder was, to all appearances, in a <lb/>ſound ſtate, our author concludes,
        that there is <lb/>always a paſſage for fluids through its veins. This <lb/>ſtructure, he
        imagines, is intended for conveying <lb/>the ſubtile watery lymph from the bladder; and
        <lb/>for preventing the urine from ſtagnating long there, <lb/>and thus becoming acrid. He
        imagines that this <lb/>opinion is confirmed by thoſe caſes in which a <lb/>conſiderable
        quantity of a fluid, reſembling urine <lb/>in colour and ſmell, has been diſcharged from the
        <lb/>arm-pits, upon a ſuppreſſion of the natural excre- <lb/>tion of urine. </p>
