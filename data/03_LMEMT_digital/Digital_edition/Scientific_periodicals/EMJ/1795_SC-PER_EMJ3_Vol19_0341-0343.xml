      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi> New negro wench of Mr John Dunn's, <lb/>who had been waſhing
        clothes at the ri- <lb/>ver, came home to all appearance perfectly <lb/>well; ſhe ſlept in a
        warm chamber. In the <lb/>morning, ſhe had not riſen ſo early as uſual; her <lb/>miſtreſs
        went to her room; found her with a <lb/>tetanus; her jaws ſtrongly locked; ſpaſms very
        <lb/>rigid of the cervical muſcles. Upon inqui- <lb/>ry I found , that about eighteen days
        previous <lb/>to that time, ſhe had a ragged piece of pine <lb/>wood run into her foot,
        which was extracted <lb/>with ſome difficulty. As I never had one pa- <lb/>tient out of a
        great number that ever did reco- <lb/>ver, when the locked jaw came on, either from
        <lb/>lacerated wounds, or puncture in the foot, <lb/>I gave not the leaſt hopes. I examined
        the <lb/>part; it appeared dry. I cut down the <pb n="342"/>
        <lb/>ſkin; and the puncture that had been made <lb/>was very perceptible; but no matter, or
        any <lb/>thing extraneous, could be diſcovered. I <lb/>ordered her mouth to be tried to get
        it <lb/>open, to adminiſter ſomething, but with- <lb/>out effect. I immediately applied a
        cauſ- <lb/>tic to the puncture; put her into a warm <lb/>bath, keeping out the wounded foot
        where <lb/>the cauſtic was; then wrapped her in a <lb/>blanket. We tried to open her mouth,
        and, <lb/>with great force, got it nearly to take a crown <lb/>piece. I ordered laudanum
        very freely, but <lb/>ſhe could not ſwallow, I gave æther and cam- <lb/>phire, which ſhe
        held in her mouth, and <lb/>gave her ſome relief; but ſwallowed not a <lb/>drop. I ordered a
        clyſter with tart. emetic. <lb/>drach. i.; it procured no ſtools, but was ſuc- <lb/>ceeded
        by a profuſe ſweat. Four hours <lb/>after, ſhe had another clyſter with tart. <lb/>emetic.
        drach. i. Half an hour after, ſhe had <lb/>a ſtool; and vomited twice. About half an
        <lb/>hour after this, the ſpaſms of the cervical muſ- <lb/>cle were leſs violent. She began
        to drink, <lb/>and open her mouth well. I took off the <lb/>cauſtic. She had three ſpoonfuls
        of ol. <lb/>Ricin. given her, which procured plenty of <lb/>ſtools. In the night, ſhe had a
        ſlight re- <pb n="343"/>
        <lb/>turn; but it went off before I ſaw her. I <lb/>put her upon bark and fetids; ſhe kept
        <lb/>very well; except the healing of the eſcar, <lb/>which was deep; and it was ſome weeks
        be- <lb/>fore it could be healed. I ſhould obſerve, <lb/>that I rubbed in mercury; but it
        could not <lb/>have had the effect the lovers of it ſuppoſe. </p>
