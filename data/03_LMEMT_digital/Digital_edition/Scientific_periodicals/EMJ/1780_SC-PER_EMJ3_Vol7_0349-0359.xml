        <lb/>A remarkable Case of Epilepſy and Dyſphagia <lb/>Spaſmodica, cured by the Uſe of Cuprum
        Am- <lb/>moniacum. By Dr <hi rend="roman">John Heyſham</hi>, Phyſician, <lb/><hi

      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">J</hi><hi rend="sc">Ane Stockbridge</hi> became a patient of <lb/>mine
        on the 9th of January 1780. She is <lb/>an unmarried country woman, in the forty-
        <lb/>ſecond year of her age, of middle ſtature, and <lb/>of a lax habit of body. About
        twelve years <lb/>ago, either from trouble, or a fright, as ſhe <lb/>imagines, ſhe was
        ſeized with fits; which, <lb/>during the ſpace of a quarter of a year, return- <lb/>ed once
        in twenty-four hours, and generally <lb/>in the night. They afterwards became more <pb
          n="350"/>
        <lb/>frequent, eſpecially in the ſummer months, <lb/>when ſhe was deprived of her memory,
        and <lb/>indeed of almoſt all her mental faculties. <lb/>Within theſe two years, they have
        only re- <lb/>turned about twice or thrice a-week. In theſe <lb/>fits, ſhe becomes
        inſenſible, her legs, her arms, <lb/>and many of the muſcles of the trunk of her <lb/>body,
        are ſo violently convulſed, that three <lb/>men are ſcarce ſufficient to hold her; ſhe
        <lb/>foams at the mouth, and in this ſtate ſhe often <lb/>continues near an hour; then
        gradually re- <lb/>covers, but is utterly ignorant of what has paſ- <lb/>ſed. About ſeven
        years ago, without any evi- <lb/>dent cauſe, ſhe was affected with a new and <lb/>peculiar
        diſorder, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> a difficulty of ſwallow- <lb/>ing, with a ſenſation of
        ſtricture and tightneſs <lb/>in her throat and breaſt; and was unable to <lb/>ſwallow either
        ſolids or fluids for the ſpace of <lb/>ſeventeen days. During this time, ſhe had no
        <lb/>epileptic fits, was entirely ſupported by nou- <lb/>riſhing glyſters, and had neither
        any evacua- <lb/>tion by urine or ſtool, but had a ſmall diſ- <lb/>charge of blood from her
        ears. Some reme- <lb/>dies were added to the glyſters, which, how- <lb/>ever, were attended
        with no ſenſible effects. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>On the 17th day, a probang was introduced <lb/>into her ſtomach; on the immediate
        removal <pb n="351"/>
        <lb/>of which, ſhe fainted near a quarter of an hour, <lb/>then recovered, was able to
        ſwallow both ſolids <lb/>and fluids with eaſe, had a ſtool, and made <lb/>near a gill of
        urine of a gelatinous conſiſtence. <lb/>This difficulty of ſwallowing, or dyſphagia
        <lb/>ſpaſmodica, continued to return regularly eve- <lb/>ry month for two years, and was
        conſtantly <lb/>removed in the ſame manner, by the intro- <lb/>duction of the probang, with
        this difference <lb/>only, that in the ſecond year, upon withdraw- <lb/>ing the inſtrument,
        inſtead of fainting, ſhe was <lb/>ſeized with ſtrong convulſions. During the <lb/>third
        year, ſhe was perfectly free from the dyſ- <lb/>phagia. But the fourth year, it again
        return- <lb/>ed without any evident cauſe, and ſhe had <lb/>four or five paroxyſms. The
        paroxyſms be- <lb/>came more frequent in the fifth year, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> about
        <lb/>once a month, and have continued without <lb/>much variation till the preſent time. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>On the morning of the 7th of January 1786, <lb/>ſhe was again affected with the
        dyſphagia; and <lb/>on the 8th, I was preſent, when Mr James, <lb/>a ſurgeon in this town,
        with ſome difficulty, <lb/>on account of the ſtricture in the gullet, <lb/>introduced the
        probang into her ſtomach; <lb/>and on its being withdrawn, a ſcene truly <lb/>melancholy and
        alarming preſented itſelf to <pb n="352"/>
        <lb/>our view. She was ſeized with moſt violent <lb/>convulſions; her head was bent forcibly
        back- <lb/>wards, ſo as to touch her back; and it was <lb/>as much as three ſtrong
        aſſiſtants could do, <lb/>to prevent her from beating herſelf to <lb/>pieces. Theſe
        convulſions continued half <lb/>an hour, when ſhe was able to ſwallow a <lb/>little æther
        and water, but remained two or <lb/>three hours in a diſagreeable ſituation, which,
        <lb/>however, ſhe is unable to deſcribe. Since <lb/>the firſt attack of the dyſphagia, ſhe
        has ſome- <lb/>times deferred the uſe of the probang for the <lb/>ſpace of ſix days, during
        which time ſhe ne- <lb/>ver has any evacuation by ſtool or urine, but <lb/>immediately after
        the operation has frequent- <lb/>ly obſerved her urine to be gelatinous. When <lb/>free from
        the dyſphagia, ſhe is conſtantly af- <lb/>fected with the epilepſy, ſo that ſhe has now
        <lb/>laboured under the former, ſeven years, under <lb/>the latter twelve years. When free
        from fits, <lb/>her appetite is good, belly natural; menſes <lb/>have always been, and
        continue to be regular, <lb/>and in all other reſpects is in tolerable health, <lb/>and able
        to perform her ordinary buſineſs. <lb/>She is ſenſible of the approach of the epilep-
        <lb/>tic fits, but the dyſphagia comes on ſuddenly; <lb/>and during its continuance, ſhe
        complains of <pb n="353"/>
        <lb/>little or no pain, but has a ſenſation of ſtric- <lb/>ture and tightness in her throat.
        She has <lb/>taken a variety of medicines, but has reaped <lb/>no advantage from any thing
        but æther, the <lb/>good effects of which were very ſlight and <lb/>tranſitory. In this
        truly diſtreſsful caſe, tak- <lb/>ing into conſideration the aſcribed cauſe of her
        <lb/>diſorder, the relief ſhe had received from æ- <lb/>ther, her lax habit of body, and
        eſpecially the <lb/>abſence of all ſymptoms which indicated any <lb/>local affection of her
        head or brain, I appre- <lb/>hend, a great degree of irritability, depending <lb/>on a
        laxity of the nervous ſyſtem, might, in a <lb/>great meaſure, be the cauſe of all her com-
        <lb/>plaints. Well acquainted with the ſtrength- <lb/>ening and tonic properties of copper,
        I was <lb/>reſolved to give it a fair trial, and am happy <lb/>to find by the event, that it
        has anſwered my <lb/>moſt ſanguine expectations. January the <lb/>9th, I accordingly
        preſcribed the following <lb/>pills, ℞. Cupri ammon. gr. xxxii. micæ pa- <lb/>nis. dr. ii.
        ſſ. Syrup. ſimp. q. ſ. fiat maſſa, in <lb/>pilulas 64 æquales dividenda. She was or-
        <lb/>dered to take one of theſe pills every morning <lb/>and night, and to increase the doſe
        according <lb/>to circumſtances. January 26th, ſoon after <lb/>ſhe takes the pills, they
        have a very peculiar <pb n="354"/>
        <lb/>effect upon her, which ſhe is unable to de- <lb/>ſcribe; ſhe, however, continued them
        for five <lb/>days, when ſhe omitted them for ſeven days. <lb/>She then began again, and
        took one, night and <lb/>morning, with nearly the ſame effects. The <lb/>epileptic fits
        returned every day for 10 days; <lb/>ſince that time, ſhe has only had a fit once in
        <lb/>three or four days. Let her take three pills <lb/>every day, and, if ſhe is able,
        increaſe the <lb/>doſe to four. February 10, Has taken all the <lb/>pills, and has had but
        two fits ſince laſt report. <lb/>Let her have double the quantity of pills, and <lb/>let her
        increaſe the doſe, according to the <lb/>effects they produce. February 28th, Began
        <lb/>with four pills each day, which produce nearly <lb/>the ſame effects as two did when
        ſhe firſt took <lb/>them. She has now increaſed the doſe to ſe- <lb/>ven or eight every day,
        without any ſenſible <lb/>effect. Continues free from fits. Let her <lb/>have ſome more
        pills. March 16th, Has con- <lb/>tinued to take eight or nine pills every day. <lb/>They
        produce no ſenſible effects. Has had no <lb/>fit. Let her have more pills. April 1ſt, Has
        <lb/>taken all the pills, and increaſed the doſe to <lb/>eleven in the day. Continues free
        from fits, <lb/>and thinks herſelf perfectly well. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>June 17th. Has continued perfectly well <lb/>ſince the 3d of this month, at which time
        ſhe <pb n="355"/>
        <lb/>was ſeized with a violent looſeneſs, which <lb/>laſted ten days, and then ceaſed
        without the <lb/>uſe of remedies. On the ſeventh, or four <lb/>days after ſhe had been
        affected with the <lb/>looſeneſs, ſhe was again ſeized with the epi- <lb/>leptic fits, and
        has had one or two every day <lb/>ſince. They continue about one hour, dur- <lb/>ing which
        ſhe is inſenſible and much convul- <lb/>ſed. Has had no return of the dyſphagia; <lb/>but
        ſince the looſeneſs, has been frequently <lb/>affected with hiccup and ſymptoms threaten-
        <lb/>ing ſuffocation, which however go off as ſoon <lb/>as ſhe gets a free diſcharge of wind
        upwards. <lb/>Appetite pretty good, ſleeps tolerably, has no <lb/>thirſt, and her belly and
        menſes are regular. <lb/>Let the pills of cuprum ammoniacum be re- <lb/>peated; let her
        begin with one morning and <lb/>night, and increaſe the doſe as before direct- <lb/>ed. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>July 5. On the 18th of June, began to <lb/>take the pills, and took one night and morn-
        <lb/>ing as ordered. They now produce ſymp- <lb/>toms very different from what they did be-
        <lb/>fore. About bout a quarter of an hour after ſhe <lb/>has taken them, ſhe becomes giddy,
        light- <lb/>headed, and in every reſpect ſeems to be in a <lb/>ſtate of intoxication. Theſe
        ſymptoms conti- <pb n="356"/>
        <lb/>nue about an hour, when ſhe is affected with <lb/>nauſea and ſickneſs at ſtomach, but
        never vo- <lb/>mits; afterwards, ſhe breaks out into a ſweat, <lb/>in which ſhe continues
        near an hour, and then <lb/>becomes perfectly well. Since the 22d of <lb/>June, has been
        entirely free from fits, hiccup, <lb/>and all other ſymptoms which uſually threaten <lb/>or
        precede them. Her menſes did not appear <lb/>the laſt period. Her appetite is good and her
        <lb/>belly regular. Let her take a pill and an <lb/>half every morning and night. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Tueſday July 25. Has continued the pills; <lb/>but, from ſome miſtake in the
        directions, has <lb/>only taken one pill and a half in the day, in- <lb/>ſtead of three;
        this quantity, however, pro- <lb/>duces the uſual effects. She has been in good <lb/>health,
        and free from all her complaints, till <lb/>two o'clock on Sunday morning, <hi rend="italic"
          >viz.</hi> 23d, <lb/>when ſhe was ſeized with the dyſphagia, and <lb/>has not been ſince
        able to ſwallow the leaſt <lb/>particle of either ſolid or fluid food. In other
        <lb/>reſpects ſhe is in good health, and complains <lb/>of a ſenſation both of hunger and
        thirſt, and <lb/>has had no evacuation either by ſtool or urine <lb/>ſince ſhe was affected
        with the ſpaſm. On <lb/>Friday, July 21. ſhe very imprudently aſſiſted <lb/>in removing ſome
        hay from the banks of the <pb n="357"/>
        <lb/>river Eſk, which were overflowed; in this <lb/>buſineſs ſhe was obliged to wade up to
        the <lb/>knees in water for a conſiderable length of <lb/>time, during a very heavy and
        inceſſant rain. <lb/>To this circumſtance, fatigue, &amp;c. ſhe attri- <lb/>butes, I think
        with reaſon, the preſent attack. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Wedneſday 26th. About 11 o'clock A. M. <lb/>the probang was introduced; and, as ſoon as
        <lb/>it was withdrawn, ſhe ſwallowed without any <lb/>difficulty a little æther and water.
        No con- <lb/>vulſions or alarming ſymptoms occurred, as <lb/>had been uſually the caſe
        before; ſhe was on- <lb/>ly affected with ſome trifling ſpaſmodic con- <lb/>tractions of the
        ſtomach and gullet, attended <lb/>with no pain, but with a peculiar kind of <lb/>noise, and
        eructation of wind; all which <lb/>however ſoon went off, and ſhe became per- <lb/>fectly
        well. Her menſes appeared almoſt im- <lb/>mediately after the operation. Let her con-
        <lb/>tinue one pill and a half night and morning <lb/>for a few days, and then increaſe the
        doſe to <lb/>two pills twice a-day.—August 12th. Has <lb/>been free from fits, and has had
        no return of <lb/>the dyſphagia, and in every reſpect is in very <lb/>good health. She has
        taken four pills a-day <lb/>ſince the 30th of laſt month. They ſtill con- <lb/>tinue to
        produce ſymptoms reſembling intoxi- <pb n="358"/>
        <lb/>cation. Repeat them and let her take two <lb/>night and morning.—September 7th. Has
        <lb/>finiſhed her pills ſome time ago, and remains <lb/>free from fits, but has complained
        of great <lb/>pain in her head for ſome days; belly coſtive. <lb/>Let her head be ſhaved,
        and apply a large bliſ- <lb/>tering plaſter to it. ℞. Maſſ. pil. ruf. dr. ii. <lb/>aſſafœt.
        dr. i. ſyrup, rhei. q. ſ. M. fiat maſſa <lb/>dividenda in pilulas 40 æquales. She was
        <lb/>ordered to take two or three of theſe pills eve- <lb/>ry night at bed-time. Let the
        copper pills be <lb/>omitted.—October 4th. The bliſter was ap- <lb/>plied as directed; it
        remained on the head <lb/>48 hours, diſcharged a conſiderable quantity <lb/>of lymph, which
        removed the complaint of <lb/>her head. She has likewiſe taken all the <lb/>laxative pills;
        they procured a ſtool or two <lb/>every day. While ſhe was taking them, ſhe <lb/>ſweeted
        profuſely, and what is ſomewhat re- <lb/>markable, the ſweet tinged her linen of a
        <lb/>yellow colour. Has had no return of the e- <lb/>pilepſy ſince the 22d of June, nor of
        the dyſ- <lb/>phagia ſince the 26th of July. At preſent is <lb/>free from all complaints.
        Let her have a box <lb/>of the copper pills and be diſmiſſed, with or- <lb/>ders to return
        ſhould any change occur in <lb/>her ſituation.—October 28. Having buſineſs <pb n="359"/>
        <lb/>in town, ſhe called to acquaint me that ſhe <lb/>has had no return of her fits,
        although ſhe <lb/>had not got the laſt box of pills, owing to a <lb/>want of cuprum
        ammoniacum. On Monday <lb/>laſt in the night ſhe had a diſcharge of blood <lb/>from both her
        ears, which was preceded by <lb/>ſome little pain in her head, which is now <lb/>gone off.
        Has had no appearance of menſes <lb/>ſince the 26th of July. Sumat pulv. cort. <lb/>Peruv.
