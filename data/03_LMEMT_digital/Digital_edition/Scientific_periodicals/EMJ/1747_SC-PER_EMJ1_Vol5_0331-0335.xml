        <lb/>A Gentleman had been plagued with a tedi- <lb/>ous Tooth-ach, which occaſioned a very
        hard <lb/>Tumor above the joining of the Cheek and <lb/>Gums of the ſecond <hi rend="italic"
          >dens molaris</hi> in the upper <lb/>Jaw on the left Side. The Tumor having ſup-
        <lb/>purated broke outwardly on his Cheek, the Mat- <lb/>ter flowing out of the Ulcer was
        for ſome time <lb/>very fetid, and ſeveral carious Pieces of Bone <lb/>came out of it. This
        Ulcer continuing long, <lb/>the Patient came to this Place with Dr. <hi rend="italic">Hugh
          <lb/>Sutherland</hi> now Phyſician in <hi rend="italic">Orkney</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>There was then in the Ulcer a Tent about <lb/>the Size of a Gooſe-Quill, an Inch and an
        half <lb/>long; when the Tent was taken out it was co- <lb/>vered with purulent-like Matter,
        but upon <lb/>leaning his Head forward and to the left Side, <lb/>a clear Liquor reſembling
        glairy Spittle drop'd <lb/>out. No ſuch Liquor or <hi rend="italic">Pus</hi> had ever run
        out <lb/>of his Noſe upon reclining his Head to the <lb/>right Side and downwards. The Sore
        had no <lb/>fetid offenſive Smell. A Probe gently bended <lb/>being put into the Sore, was
        turned in differ- <lb/>ent Directions in a large Cavity formed of <lb/>Bone lined with a
        ſmooth tenſe Membrane, <lb/>which covered the Bone every where that we <lb/>applied the
        Point of the Probe. The Roots of <lb/>the rotten Tooth, which began this Trouble, <lb/>and
        had often been attempted to be drawn by <lb/>different Tooth-drawers, were ſtill faſt in
        their <lb/>Sockets. Dr. <hi rend="italic">Sutherland</hi> and the Patient both <lb/>informed
        me that they had ſeveral times obſer- <lb/>ved a Thickneſs, and felt what they thought
        <lb/>to be a Fluctuation of Liquor in the Palate or <lb/>Roof of the Mouth, which there was
        not then <lb/>any Appearance of. The Patient was other- <lb/>wiſe in good Health. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>By cutting the Gum between the Roots of <lb/>the rotten Tooth I made way for a thin
        Piece <lb/>of Iron, which I puſhed forcibly in between <lb/>theſe Roots, and then thruſting
        it to a Side, I <lb/>priſed the one Root inwards out of its Socket, <lb/>and made the other
        ſo looſe that it came after- <lb/>wards eaſily out. A ſmall Gimblet being im- <lb/>mediately
        put into the fartheſt back Socket, I <lb/>endeavoured to make it pierce into the <hi
          rend="italic">antrum <lb/>maxillare</hi>, but could not direct it ſo far back. <lb/>To
        give a Diſcharge of the <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> into the <lb/>Mouth, and to prevent its
        running out at the <lb/>Orifice in his Cheek, till the ſwelling of the <lb/>Palate ſhould
        give an Opportunity of making <lb/>a more effectual Drain, I laid aſide the Tent, <lb/>and
        puſhing a Shoemaker's Awl from the join- <lb/>ing of the Gums and Cheek into the ſinuous
        <lb/>Ulcer near the Aperture made into the <hi rend="italic">Antrum</hi>
        <lb/>by the former <hi rend="italic">Caries</hi>, by the means of a very <lb/>flexible
        Probe, I introduced a ſmall Cord into <lb/>the Wound made with the Awl, and brought <lb/>an
        End of it out at the external Orifice of the <lb/>Ulcer, deſiring the Mouth to be frequently
        rinſed <lb/>with Brandy to render the new Wound callous <lb/>ſoon. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The Patient's Buſineſs obliging him to return <lb/>home, he went away with this Seton,
        which <lb/>being taken out ſome time after, this new Paſ- <lb/>ſage ſhut up as well as the
        external Orifice; <lb/>ſoon after which the Palate ſwelled, and being <lb/>opened by Dr. <hi
          rend="italic">Sutherland</hi>, ſome ſmall Pieces <lb/>of Bone came out, and our Patient
        has been <lb/>well ever ſince. </p>
      <pb n="334"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">Hiſt.</hi> 2. In conſequence of a Tooth-ach and <lb/>rotten Root, a
        Tumor roſe in a young Gentle- <lb/>man's Cheek, which had been opened in the <lb/>Inſide of
        his Mouth, and a glairy clear Matter <lb/>was evacuated, but the Inciſion cloſing ſoon,
        <lb/>the Tumor again appeared, and when I firſt <lb/>ſaw him, was as large as a ſmall
        Golf-ball, fil- <lb/>ling all the Hollow of the Cheek, and being <lb/>conſiderably
        prominent. I judged it to be of <lb/>the incyſted kind, forced out the Remains of <lb/>the
        rotten Tooth; but the Tumor not evacua- <lb/>ting at the Sockets, Mr. <hi rend="italic">John
          Douglas</hi> at my <lb/>Deſire opened it with a Lancet within his <lb/>Cheek. Clear <hi
          rend="italic">Mucus</hi> being preſſed out at the <lb/>Orifice, the Tumor ſubſided, when
        we plainly <lb/>felt three <hi rend="italic">Exoſtoſes</hi> pointing towards each other,
        <lb/>between which the Sac had been nitched. One <lb/>of the <hi rend="italic"
          >Exoſtoſes</hi> roſe from the Root of the na- <lb/>ſal Proceſs of the maxillary Bone. The
        ſecond <lb/>grew out from that ſame Proceſs, or from the <lb/>anterior orbitar Proceſs of
        the <hi rend="italic">os malarum</hi> near <lb/>to the Orbit. And the third, which was the
        <lb/>largeſt, reſembling, when felt thro' the Tegu- <lb/>ments, an old Cock's Spur, roſe out
        of the <lb/>Cheek-bone. We could be ſenſible of no Bone <lb/>being bare or ſpoilt by a Probe
        introduced at <lb/>the Wound, nor had we Reaſon, from the <lb/>Nature of the Matter
        evacuated, to judge that <lb/>there was any carious Bone. A Tent with a <lb/>Thread hanging
        to it was put into the Wound, <lb/>which was continued ſome Weeks, Brandy and <lb/>Melroſe
        being frequently injected into the em- <lb/>pty Cyſt, and the Patient rinſing that Side of
        <lb/>the Mouth often with Brandy. After we thought <lb/>the Paſſage callous the Tent was no
        more uſed, <pb n="335"/>
        <lb/>and the Patient has had no Return of the Tu- <lb/>mor. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">Hiſt.</hi> 3. Upon drawing the Roots of a rot- <lb/>ten Tooth of a
        young Lady who had a Tumor <lb/>reſembling the one deſcribed in the former Hi- <lb/>ſtory, a
        yellowiſh-coloured thin Liquor flowed <lb/>out of one of the Sockets; this Liquor had a
        <lb/>great many Particles reſembling Oil ſwimming <lb/>on its Top, but had no fetid Smell.
        The ſwel- <lb/>ling immediately ſubſided, no <hi rend="italic">Exoſtoſis</hi> was <lb/>felt;
        a ſmall Probe introduced into the Hole <lb/>of the Socket could not be made to touch any
        <lb/>bare Bone in the Circumference of a large Ca- <lb/>vity it was put into; nor could we
        diſcover the <lb/>Paſſage by which the Liquor came from the <lb/>external Cyſtis into the
        Socket of the Tooth. <lb/>The Management of this Caſe was the ſame as <lb/>of the preceding;
        the oily Particles appeared <lb/>ſeveral Days in the Liquor that flowed when <lb/>the Tent
        was taken out; at length they could <lb/>not be obſerved. The Lady has continued <lb/>well
        and free of ſwelling. </p>
