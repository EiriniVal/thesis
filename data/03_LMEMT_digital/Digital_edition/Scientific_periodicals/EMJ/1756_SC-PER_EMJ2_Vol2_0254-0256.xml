        <lb/>known to be a ſtrong emetic, when <lb/>given in a large doſe; and it has alſo been
        <lb/>often preſcribed in ſmaller quantities as an <lb/>attenuant, ſudorific, and diuretic:
        but an <lb/>accident lately diſcovered to me a very diffe- <lb/>rent effect of it, from any
        of the above <lb/>mentioned. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="sc">Being</hi> one evening, in <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 1755, <lb/>a
        little hot and feveriſh, with a quick and full <lb/>pulſe, I went early to bed, and drank a
        full <lb/><hi rend="italic">Engliſh</hi> pint of ſack-whey which I had order- <lb/>ed one to
        make for me. Very ſoon after <lb/>this, I fell aſleep, and continued all night
        <lb/>oppreſſed with an unuſual drowſineſs: at ten <lb/>next morning, I with great difficulty
        got ſo <lb/>far the better of this lethargic diſpoſition, as <pb n="255"/>
        <lb/>to get out of bed; when I found myſelf ſtill <lb/>heavy and inclined to ſleep, with a
        laſſitude <lb/>and numbneſs in my limbs, ſo that I could <lb/>ſcarce ſtand. Being thus
        incapable to go a- <lb/>bout buſineſs, I reſolved to ride out on horſe- <lb/>back; and
        having mounted with ſome diffi- <lb/>culty, found my head very giddy, and had <lb/>much ado
        to keep myſelf from falling aſleep. <lb/>After having rode three hours, I returned <lb/>home
        much in the ſame ſituation, and was <lb/>ſurprized to find two apprentices with the
        <lb/>ſame complaints I had myſelf: they could <lb/>aſſign no cauſe of their being ſo
        affected, nor <lb/>had they eat any thing but their uſual food, <lb/>except the curd of
        which I had got the whey. <lb/>Being led by this to ſuſpect ſomething un- <lb/>common in the
        wine with which the poſſet <lb/>was made; I called for it, and had a bottle <lb/>brought me
        containing <hi rend="italic">vinum benedictum</hi>, <lb/>which had been made about a month
        before; <lb/>and the bottle having been put in an impro- <lb/>per place, was the reaſon of
        its having been <lb/>miſtaken for <hi rend="italic">Liſbon</hi>. I found I had drank <lb/>in
        my whey about a gill and a half of this e- <lb/>metic wine, and was ſurprized it had not vo-
        <lb/>mited me ſtrongly. Thinking, however, that <lb/>the finely attenuated particles of the
        antimony <pb n="256"/>
        <lb/>might be moſtly ſuſpended in the curd, I <lb/>inquired particularly at the two young
        Gen- <lb/>tlemen who had eat it, whether they were <lb/>affected with any <hi rend="italic"
          >nauſea</hi> or vomiting; but <lb/>they told me they found no other effect but a
        <lb/>heavineſs and great inclination to ſleep. This <lb/>drowſineſs continued with them two
        days; <lb/>but I did not find myſelf quite free of it at <lb/>the end of four days. I do not
        know if it be <lb/>worth while to obſerve, that the day after I <lb/>had drank the above
        whey, my pulſe was ten <lb/>in the minute ſlower than it had been the <lb/>night before. It
        may be proper however to <lb/>take notice, that the <hi rend="italic">vinum benedictum</hi>
        which <lb/>was uſed, by miſtake, inſtead of <hi rend="italic">Liſbon</hi>, was <lb/>made
        exactly as is directed in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh <lb/>Diſpenſatory</hi>; and I have
        ſince found half an <lb/>ounce of it vomit a patient very well. </p>
