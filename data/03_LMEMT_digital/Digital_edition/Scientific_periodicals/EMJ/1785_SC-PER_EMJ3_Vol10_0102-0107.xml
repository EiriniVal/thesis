        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>N the memoir before us, Mr Bordenave ſets <lb/>out with
        obſerving, that if there be an infi- <lb/>nite number of diſeaſes to which mankind are
        <lb/>expoſed, unavoidably terminating in death, by <lb/>deſtroying the ſources of life, ſo
        there are often <lb/>other external cauſes, which, acting differently <lb/>on the organs,
        ſuſpend only the vital action, <lb/>but in this manner produce an apparent death, <lb/>which
        will ſoon become real, if proper aſſiſtance <lb/>be not given. This is exemplified both in
        the <lb/>caſe of perſons ſuffocated by the ſmoke of char- <lb/>coal, and in the caſe alſo of
        many new born in- <lb/>fants. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Theſe, by proper aſſiſtance, are often reco- <lb/>vered; and our author is of opinion,
        that art <pb n="103"/>
        <lb/>may here extend its influence ſtill farther to <lb/>children, <hi rend="italic"
          >viz.</hi> periſhing in the womb, who have <lb/>ſurvived the death of the mother. This
        aſſer- <lb/>tion, in the memoir before us, he attempts to <lb/>ſupport by a collection of
        facts, which taken <lb/>ſingly might not be ſuppoſed to have much <lb/>weight. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The firſt caſe he mentions, is that of a wo- <lb/>man who died about an hour after
        mid-day, <lb/>and was opened about ſeven in the evening by <lb/>M. Dayries, ſurgeon to the
        Hotel-Dieu. She <lb/>was ſuppoſed to have been only ſix months <lb/>gone with child. He,
        however, took from her <lb/>womb a male child, diſtinct in all its parts and, <lb/>by the
        redneſs of its colour, ſhewing the ap- <lb/>pearance of life. A palpitation was diſtinctly
        <lb/>felt at the region of the heart. Reſpiration <lb/>ſoon began, and it continued to live
        for two <lb/>hours. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>After this, Mr Bordenave takes notice of a <lb/>number of caſes mentioned by Mr
        Cangiamila, <lb/>in his Embryologia Sacra, a work which he re- <lb/>preſents as highly
        valuable, and too little known. <lb/>On that authority, he remarks, that, in the city
        <lb/>of Montreal and the neighbourhood, in the <lb/>ſpace of twenty-four years, twenty-one
        living <pb n="104"/>
        <lb/>children had been extracted by the Cæſarian <lb/>operation: that between the year 1704
        and <lb/>1748, ſixty children had been extracted in the <lb/>ſame manner at Caltaniſſecta,
        of whom only <lb/>five were found dead: that at Victoria, a city <lb/>in the dioceſe of
        Syracuſe, between the years <lb/>1734 and 1752, the Cæſarian operation had <lb/>been
        performed twenty times, and in every <lb/>caſe a living child extracted: and that at Sam-
        <lb/>buca, a city in the dioceſe of Girenti, twenty- <lb/>two pregnant women having died,
        from eigh- <lb/>teen of them children were extracted alive; in <lb/>three of the caſes, from
        the putrefaction which <lb/>had taken place, there was reaſon to believe <lb/>that the child
        had been dead ſome time before <lb/>the death of the mother; but the fourth was <lb/>found
        ſtifled among the bed-clothes, probably <lb/>having come into the world among the laſt mo-
        <lb/>ments of the life of the mother. Where, there- <lb/>fore, a pregnant woman dies,
        eſpecially in the <lb/>advanced periods of that ſtate, the Cæſarian <lb/>operation ſhould
        never, he thinks, be neglected, <lb/>but ought to be regarded as an act of huma- <lb/>nity. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This operation may, he obſerves, in many <lb/>caſes, particularly where there is ſudden
        death, <pb n="105"/>
        <lb/>be delayed too long, from an apprehenſion that <lb/>the mother herſelf may be ſtill in
        a recoverable <lb/>ſtate. But, excluſive of the other ſigns of <lb/>death, this, our author
        thinks, may be certainly <lb/>determined by the inſpection of the eyes alone, <lb/>which, in
        a ſhort time after death, acquire a <lb/>dull and collapſed appearance. But beſides
        <lb/>this, he alſo propoſes, that, in every caſe, the <lb/>ſame attention ſhould be paid as
        would be done <lb/>with a living woman, where the aim was to pre- <lb/>ſerve both mother and
        child. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>But the performance of the operation, he ob- <lb/>ſerves, is not all. It is neceſſary
        to diſtinguiſh <lb/>whether the child brought into the world with- <lb/>out apparent ſigns
        of life, be really in a recover- <lb/>able ſtate or not, that proper meaſures may, in
        <lb/>the former caſe, be taken for its revival. Life, <lb/>he obſerves, is more eaſily
        retained in an infant <lb/>which has never breathed, than after this func- <lb/>tion has
        been exerciſed, as circulation can then <lb/>go on without the aid of reſpiration. Paleneſs
        <lb/>of the body, lividity, coldneſs, the want of re- <lb/>ſpiration, and even of obvious
        pulſation, are not <lb/>then certain marks of death. Putrefaction <lb/>alone, he thinks,
        affords an indubitable ſign; <pb n="106"/>
        <lb/>and even this is to be carefully diſtinguiſhed <lb/>from a gangrenous diſpoſition,
        which may be <lb/>the effect of compreſſion, contuſion, or ſimilar <lb/>accidents. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>For the recovery of infants apparently dead, <lb/>he recommends the blowing warm air
        into the <lb/>mouth, irritation of the noſtrils, bathing in aro- <lb/>matic decoctions, the
        application of compreſſes <lb/>dipped in warm wine, ſuction of the niples, par-
        <lb/>ticularly the left, which he thinks is peculiarly <lb/>ſenſible from its numerous
        nerves, and, finally, <lb/>injection of tobacco-ſmoke into the inteſtines. <lb/>Theſe
        meaſures are, he thinks, particularly pro- <lb/>per where death is the conſequence of weak-
        <lb/>neſs, or a ſtagnation of the fluids. But when <lb/>it ariſes from a ſuffocation of the
        vital principle, <lb/>occaſioned by plethora, or by that obſtruction <lb/>which has ariſen
        from compreſſion of the infant, <lb/>then a ſlight evacuation of blood, by cutting <lb/>the
        umbilical cord, becomes, he thinks, uſeful, <lb/>and ſhould precede other practices. Theſe
        <lb/>meaſures are not always immediately fol- <lb/>lowed by the deſired effect. From
        experience, <lb/>it appears, that, in ſome inſtances, they ſucceed <lb/>only after being
        tried for ſeveral hours. And <pb n="107"/>
        <lb/>he particularly records one inſtance publiſhed <lb/>in the Gazette de Manheim, for the
        year 1773, <lb/>where a recovery was effected by long conti- <lb/>nued perſeverance, after
        the moſt probable mea- <lb/>ſures had been uſed for a conſiderable time, <lb/>without any
        proſpect of ſucceſs. To theſe he <lb/>ſubjoins two other ſimilar caſes, the one by Mr
        <lb/>Andrieu, ſurgeon at Gaillac, the other by Mr <lb/>Faiſſolis, ſurgeon at Lyons. And he
        concludes <lb/>with obſerving, that, from theſe facts, it ap- <lb/>pears, a laudable
        attention to infants remaining <lb/>in the womb of thoſe mothers who die in a <lb/>pregnant
        ſtate cannot be too much encouraged. <lb/>Though the labour ſhould often be in vain,
        <lb/>yet it will be an ample recompence, if, in <lb/>ſome inſtances, the life of a child can
        be pre- <lb/>ſerved. </p>
