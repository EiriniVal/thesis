        </note><hi rend="dc(2)">M</hi>ORRIS EVANS, aged 30 years, <lb/>on the 13th of March, 1759,
        was <lb/>admitted into Guy's hoſpital, with a remarkable com- <lb/>plaint in his cheſt,
        which attacked him in the month <lb/>of Auguſt 1758, with the ſymptoms of a pleuriſy. <pb
          n="195"/>
        <lb/>Upon inſpection it appeared, that the left ſide of the <lb/>thorax was greatly
        inlarged, and prodigiouſly diſ- <lb/>tended: the pectoral muſcle was ſomewhat raiſed up;
        <lb/>on preſſure it felt ſoft, and readily gave way: upon a <lb/>removal of the preſſure,
        the integuments reſumed <lb/>their former appearance, no marks of impreſſion re-
        <lb/>maining on this, or any other part of the thorax, ſo <lb/>as to conſtitute the
        characteriſtic of an œdematous <lb/>ſwelling. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The ſpaces betwixt the 9th and 10th, and betwixt <lb/>the 10th and 11th ribs, counting
        from above, were <lb/>viſibly inlarged, and ſomewhat elevated: they felt <lb/>ſoft, and
        yielded to the fingers; but were not at all <lb/>inflamed, or otherwiſe diſcoloured. Upon
        examina- <lb/>tion, I diſcovered a fluctuation in both theſe parts. <lb/>The general
        ſymptoms that attended this caſe were <lb/>ſimilar to thoſe ariſing from all conſiderable
        collec- <lb/>tions of fluids depoſited in either cavities of the <lb/>thorax: for inſtance,
        the patient had a continual <lb/>ſlow fever; a ſhort cough, but without the leaſt ex-
        <lb/>pectoration of matter; a great difficulty in reſpiration, <lb/>particularly in the acts
        of expiration. He was inca- <lb/>pable of lying down on the right ſide, without very
        <lb/>great uneaſineſs; he was much emaciated; and his <lb/>countenance was uniformly ſallow:
        he did not com- <lb/>plain of ſo much pain, or ſo great a difficulty in <lb/>breathing, when
        in an erect poſture, as I have ſome- <lb/>times obſerved in diſeaſes of this kind even where
        <lb/>the quantity of extravaſated fluid has been much <lb/>leſs; but at the ſame time I muſt
        acknowledge, that <lb/>no fair inference could be deduced from hence, be- <lb/>cauſe of the
        peculiar poſition the diſeaſed ſide was <lb/>put in when the poor man ſat down, or ſtood up;
          <pb n="196"/>
        <lb/>either of which he was incapable of doing without <lb/>being ſupported. The left ſide
        of the thorax inclined <lb/>forwards, and protuberated in a peculiar manner, ſo <lb/>as to
        give the head and trunk an horizontal poſture; <lb/>in which poſition of the body, the
        weight of the con- <lb/>tained fluid moſt certainly was, in part, prevented <lb/>from
        preſſing ſo forcibly upon the left portion of the <lb/>diaphragm, the mediaſtinum, and the
        right portion <lb/>of the lungs, as it muſt neceſſarily have done in a <lb/>more erect
        poſition of the body. He had one ſym- <lb/>ptom, which I had never before obſerved in
        patients <lb/>labouring under this complaint; that is, he was in- <lb/>capable of lying on
        his back, without bringing on <lb/>very alarming threats of ſuffocation; but he did not
        <lb/>remember ever to have heard any noiſe or rattling of <lb/>the pus upon motion. He could
        lie moſt conveni- <lb/>ently on his left ſide; but even that poſture was of <lb/>late become
        very painful to him. In ſhort, he could <lb/>find no tolerable poſture to put his body into,
        but <lb/>that of inclining it conſiderably forwards, which (I <lb/>have already obſerved) he
        was under a neceſſity of <lb/>doing, to enable him to draw his breath; and I dare
        <lb/>venture to ſay, that, upon attending to the ſubſe- <lb/>quent part of the hiſtory of
        this poor mortal's caſe, <lb/>the reaſon, why ſuch effects ſhould be produced from <lb/>ſuch
        a cauſe, will very readily occur to thoſe, who <lb/>have a moderate degree of knowledge of
        the formation <lb/>and uſes of theſe parts of the human body. Upon <lb/>making an inciſion
        upon the moſt prominent part of <lb/>the ſpace betwixt the 10th and 11th rib, in the cavity
        <lb/>of the thorax of the left ſide, at leaſt eight Wincheſ- <lb/>ter quarts of a thin
        yellow matter, not at all fœtid, <lb/>was diſcharged upon the ſpot in a full ſtream: the <pb
          n="197"/>
        <lb/>matter iſſued thro' the wound by leaps, and was <lb/>projected at the diſtance of two
        yards and upwards <lb/>from the patient's body: he did not faint during the <lb/>operation,
        nor afterwards; but from that moment he <lb/>grew eaſy; his ſymptoms abated; he ſlept well
        at <lb/>night; and the next day he had no bad ſymptoms, <lb/>except that his difficulty in
        breathing was not quite <lb/>removed. This, indeed, could not reaſonably be ex- <lb/>pected,
        conſidering the long diſuſe and extenſion <lb/>which the diaphragm, the intercoſtal muſcles,
        and <lb/>the reſt of the muſcles of reſpiration, had undergone <lb/>from the preſſure and
        weight of the confined matter, <lb/>joined to the injury which the lungs themſelves had
        <lb/>ſuſtained. He continued with very little alteration <lb/>till the fourth day, when his
        reſpiration became worſe, <lb/>accompanied with bad nights, a quick pulſe, a great
        <lb/>diſcharge of fœtid matter from the wound, and a <lb/>fluſhing in his face. Theſe
        ſymptoms remained till <lb/>the 9th. To-day his breathing was better, his pulſe <lb/>became
        more calm, the fluſhings in his face diſap- <lb/>peared; but the diſcharge was conſiderable
        in quan- <lb/>tity, and he complained of a want of appetite, which, <lb/>till now, had been
        tolerably good ever ſince the ope- <lb/>ration. On the tenth day, his difficulty of
        breathing <lb/>returned; the diſcharge was very great, and offen- <lb/>ſive; he had very
        little ſleep laſt night: in ſhort, he <lb/>ſeems greatly upon the decline. 11th, 12th, and
        <lb/>13th, he continued much as on the 10th. 14th and <lb/>15th days he has had more ſleep
        than uſual; his ap- <lb/>petite very bad; cough frequent, and troubleſome; <lb/>diſcharge
        very thin, and conſiderable in quantity. <lb/>Upon exerting his powers in the act of
        expiration, to <lb/>diſcharge the matter from the cavity, there appeared <pb n="198"/>
        <lb/>an eminence betwixt the 7th and 8th ribs (counting <lb/>from above) on the anterior
        lateral part of the tho- <lb/>rax, which was very tender; but, upon his ceaſing <lb/>to
        exert himſelf, the ſwelling diſappeared. 16th and <lb/>17th days, his cough very
        troubleſome; the diſcharge <lb/>from the wound was great; the matter very thin, <lb/>and
        fœtid; he gets very little ſleep; his pulſe quick, <lb/>and low; his tongue dry, and
        parched: in ſhort, to <lb/>all appearance, he ſeemed to have a very ſhort time <lb/>to live.
        But, notwithſtanding theſe threatening ſym- <lb/>ptoms, he very unexpectedly ſurvived till
        the 10th of <lb/>June following (exactly 12 weeks from the time of <lb/>his undergoing the
        firſt operation). In the middle of <lb/>the month of April next preceding his death, he
        <lb/>thought himſelf much better than he had been for <lb/>many days before: his diſcharge
        at this time was <lb/>much leſſened; but his pulſe was very weak, and <lb/>fluttering. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>About three weeks before the patient's death, a <lb/>ſecond opening was made by
        inciſion betwixt the <lb/>11th and 12th ribs by my collegue Mr. Way, under <lb/>whoſe
        immediate care this poor man was from the <lb/>day of his admiſſion into the hoſpital, and
        who treated <lb/>him with the greateſt humanity and judgment. <lb/>Three days before the
        patient's deceaſe, the ſwelling <lb/>betwixt the 7th and 8th ribs burſt of itſelf, and diſ-
        <lb/>charged at leaſt a pint of matter, that was exceed- <lb/>ingly offenſive. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Upon opening the body, the following particulars <lb/>were diſcovered: the right
        portion of the lungs was <lb/>greatly ulcerated on its ſuperior part, where it ad-
        <lb/>hered firmly to the pleura: on the inferior part of <lb/>the cavity, the lungs adhered
        to the diaphragm; the <pb n="199"/>
        <lb/>lobes of the lungs on this ſide were not ſo much <lb/>waſted as I expected they would
        have been, from the <lb/>great degree of preſſure which they had ſo long ſu- <lb/>ſtained
        from the prodigious quantity of matter, that <lb/>was confined in the oppoſite cavity of the
        thorax; <lb/>nor was there any extravaſation in the right cavity of <lb/>the thorax. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The lobes of the lungs on the left ſide were almoſt <lb/>intirely deſtroyed: in this
        cavity there was near a <lb/>quart of fœtid matter; the whole of its internal ſur- <lb/>face
        was ulcerated, and the two inferior ribs were <lb/>carious in the neighbourhood of the
        ſecond opening. <lb/>In every other part the ribs were ſound; ſo was the <lb/>ſternum. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The pericardium and heart appeared in their natu- <lb/>ral ſtate. The injury done to
        the internal ſurface of <lb/>the left cavity of the thorax was ſo great, as to have
        <lb/>deſtroyed almoſt the whole of the intercoſtal muſcles <lb/>on that ſide of the trunk. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> It may be worth remarking, that this pa- <lb/>tient did
        not any time ſuffer the leaſt inconvenience <lb/>from the preſſure of the external air,
        which entered <lb/>into the cavity of the thorax thro' the inciſions, as <lb/>has been ſaid
        by authors to have happened in a great <lb/>degree in the like caſes; but as that effect was
        not <lb/>produced in this, or any other inſtances of the like <lb/>kind, which has come
        under my inſpection, I am <lb/>inclined to conjecture, that the bad effects of the
        <lb/>preſſure of the external air, when admitted thro' an <lb/>opening made into the cavity
        of the thorax, is ſuch <lb/>an inconvenience as may rather be ſuppoſed to be <lb/>likely to
        happen, than has been really known to hap- <lb/>pen often; the act of breathing having never
        been <pb n="200"/>
        <lb/>in the leaſt ſuſpended, altho' the openings made into <lb/>the cavity have been very
        large, and the time taken <lb/>for dreſſing the patient (ſometimes once, ſometimes
        <lb/>twice a day) has been very conſiderable; but, on the <lb/>contrary, at every dreſſing,
        I have obſerved, that the <lb/>patient has breathed with greater freedom and eaſe <lb/>than
        he could do before the performance of this ope- <lb/>ration, or even for ſome hours before
        the dreſſings <lb/>were renewed. As the matter in this diſeaſe lies <lb/>looſely in the
        cavity of the thorax, there is no greater <lb/>danger of wounding the lungs in this
        operation, than <lb/>there is of wounding the inteſtines or omentum, in <lb/>tapping the
        abdomen in the aſcites; and if the me- <lb/>thod be purſued, which I have recommended for
        <lb/>making the inciſion thro' the intercoſtal muſcles, <lb/>there will be no danger of
        wounding the intercoſtal <lb/>artery, which is a circumſtance much dreaded by <lb/>ſome
        practitioners, but with no great reaſon. How- <lb/>ever, was this to happen, it would
        probably not be <lb/>attended with any bad conſequences, as the bleeding <lb/>might very
        readily be ſtopped by preſſure, or other- <lb/>wiſe. </p>
