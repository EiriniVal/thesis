        </note><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>HERE is, perhaps, no ſubject in phyſiology, <lb/>and very few
        in philoſophy in general, that <lb/>has engaged more attention than that of the uſe of <hi
          rend="italic">reſpi- <lb/>ration</hi>. It is evident, that without breathing moſt animals
        <lb/>would preſently die; and it is alſo well known, that the <lb/>ſame air will not long
        anſwer the purpoſe: for if it has <lb/>been frequently reſpired, the breathing of it is as
        fatal as <lb/>the total deprivation of air. But by what property it is, <lb/>that air
        contributes to the ſupport of animal life; and why <lb/>air that has been much breathed will
        no more anſwer <lb/>the purpoſe, ſeems not to have been diſcovered by any of <lb/>the many
        philoſophers and phyſicians who have pro- <lb/>feſſedly written upon the ſubject; and it
        might have con- <lb/>tinued to elude all <hi rend="italic">direct inveſtigation</hi>, when
        it diſcovered <lb/>itſelf, without any trouble or thought, in the courſe of <lb/>my
        reſearches into the properties of different kinds of <lb/>air, which had at firſt quite
        another object. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In theſe experiments it clearly appeared, that reſpiration <lb/>is a <hi rend="italic"
          >phlogiſtic proceſs</hi>, affecting air in the very ſame manner <pb n="227"/>
        <lb/>as every other phlogiſtic proceſs (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> putreſaction, the
        <lb/>efferveſcence of iron-filings and brimſtone, or the calcina- <lb/>tion of metals,
        &amp;c.) affects it; diminiſhing the quantity of it <lb/>in a certain proportion, leſſening
        its ſpecific gravity, and <lb/>rendering it unfit for reſpiration or inflammation, but
        <lb/>leaving it in a ſtate capable of being reſtored to a tolerable <lb/>degree of purity by
        agitation in water, &amp;c. Having diſ- <lb/>covered this, I concluded, as may be ſeen Phil.
        Tranſ. vol. <lb/>LXII. p. 187. and <hi rend="italic">Obſervations upon Air</hi>, vol. I. p.
        78. 277. <lb/>that the uſe of the lungs is to carry off a putrid <hi rend="italic"
          >effluvium</hi>, <lb/>or to diſcharge that phlogiſton, which had been taken <lb/>into the
        ſyſtem with the aliment, and was become, as it <lb/>were, <hi rend="italic">effete</hi>; the
        air that is reſpired ſerving as a <hi rend="italic">menſtruum</hi>
        <lb/>for that purpoſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>What I then concluded to be the uſe of <hi rend="italic">reſpiration</hi> in ge-
        <lb/>neral, I have now, I think, proved to be effected by means <lb/>of the <hi
          rend="italic">blood</hi>, in conſequence of its coming ſo nearly into <lb/>contact with
        the air in the lungs; the blood appearing to <lb/>be a fluid wonderfully formed to imbibe,
        and part with, <lb/>that principle which the chemiſts call phlogiſton, and <lb/>changing its
        colour in conſequence of being charged with <lb/>it, or being freed from it; and affecting
        air in the very <lb/>ſame manner, both out of the body and in the lungs; and <lb/>even
        notwithſtanding the interpoſition of various ſub- <lb/>ſtances, which prevent its coming
        into immediate con- <lb/>tact with the air. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As it may not be unpleaſing or unuſeful, I ſhall, <lb/>before I relate my own
        experiments, briefly recite the <lb/>principal of the opinions which have been held con- <pb
          n="228"/>
        <lb/>cerning the uſe of reſpiration, from <hi rend="sc">haller</hi>'s excellent <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Syſtem of Phyſiology</hi>, and ſome others of the moſt eminent <lb/>writers
        upon that ſubject. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="sc">hippocrates</hi> reckoned air among the <hi rend="italic">aliments</hi>
        of the <lb/>body. But it was more generally the opinion of the an- <lb/>cients, that, there
        being a kind of <hi rend="italic">vital fire</hi> kept up in the <lb/>heart, the heat of the
        blood was tempered in the lungs. <lb/><hi rend="sc">galen</hi> alſo ſuppoſed, that there was
        ſomething equiva- <lb/>lent to a fire conſtantly kept up in the heart; and that <lb/>the
        chief uſe of the lungs was to carry off ſuch vapours <lb/>as were equivalent to ſmoke thrown
        off from that fire. <lb/><hi rend="sc">haller</hi>, vol. III. p. 354. <hi rend="sc"
          >cartesius</hi> maintained the <lb/>ſame vital fire in the heart, ſuppoſing that air was
        ne- <lb/>ceſſary for cooling and condenſing the blood. <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> p. 343. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Of the more modern phyſiologiſts, ſome have thought <lb/>that the air itſelf is taken
        into the lungs; others, that it is <lb/>only ſomething extracted from the air, as the more
        ſubtle <lb/>parts of that fluid, an ether, or aerial nitre; while others <lb/>ſuppoſe it to
        be the air itſelf, but diſſolved in water, and <lb/>therefore in an unelaſtic ſtate, <hi
          rend="italic">ibid.</hi> p. 321. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Most of thoſe who think that air is taken into the <lb/>blood ſuppoſe it to be taken in
        by the lungs, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> p. <lb/>330. Some ſuppoſe, that the effect of the
        admiſſion <lb/>of this air into the blood is a fermentation, p. 332. <lb/>Others ſuppoſe,
        that it acts by its ſpring, preventing <lb/>the too cloſe contact of the globules, and
        thereby pre- <lb/>ſerving its fluidity, inteſtine motion, and heat, <hi rend="italic"
          >ibid.</hi>
        <hi rend="sc">ber- <lb/>tier</hi> ſuppoſed, that the circulation of the blood was, in <lb/>a
        great meaſure, owing to the admiſſion of air into it. <lb/><hi rend="sc">van helmont</hi>
        aſcribed the volatility of the fixed ele- <pb n="229"/>
        <lb/>ments in the food to this air, p. 336.; and <hi rend="sc">stevenson</hi>
        <lb/>thought, that the air which had circulated in the blood, <lb/>and which had heated the
        blood too much, was exhaled <lb/>by the lungs, p. 355. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Others ſay, that the air itſelf is not admitted into the <lb/>blood, but only ſome
        active, ſpirituous, and ethereal par- <lb/>ticles; that this vital ſpirit paſſes from the
        lungs to the <lb/>heart and arteries, and at length becomes the animal ſpi- <lb/>rits, which
        are by this means generated from the air, p. <lb/>333. Others, who do not admit that the
        animal ſpirits <lb/>are derived from the air, ſtill ſay that ſome other <hi rend="italic"
          >vital <lb/>principle</hi> comes from thence. This vital principle <hi rend="sc">mal-
          <lb/>pighius</hi> ſuppoſes to be a ſaline vapour; <hi rend="sc">lister</hi>, a hot,
        <lb/>inflammable, ſulphureous ſpirit; <hi rend="sc">vieussenius</hi>, a volatile <lb/>acid
        ſalt, which keeps up the fermentation of the blood; <lb/>and <hi rend="sc">bryan
          robinson</hi>, the aerial acid, which preſerves the <lb/>blood from putrefaction;
        preſerves alſo its denſity, and <lb/>ſtrengthens the animal fibres. For this reaſon he ſup-
        <lb/>poſes it is that we feel ourſelves refreſhed in cold air, as <lb/>it abounds with a
        more plentiful acid quality, p. 334. <lb/>They who ſuppoſe that nitre is taken from the air
        into <lb/>the blood, aſcribe to that principle its fermentation, its <lb/>heat, and its
        denſity, p. 334. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It is a received opinion, that one uſe of the lungs is to <lb/>attenuate the blood, p.
        359; and <hi rend="sc">malpighius</hi> adds, <lb/>that by this means, the different
        particles of the blood <lb/>become thoroughly mixed together; while others think <lb/>that
        the blood is condenſed in the lungs; and others, that <lb/>the globules, and all the finer
        humours, receive their con- <lb/>figuration there, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> Some,
        without conſidering the <pb n="230"/>
        <lb/>air as of any other uſe than to put the lungs in motion, <lb/>think, that heat is
        produced in the lungs by the attrition <lb/>of the blood in paſſing through them. <hi
          rend="italic">Miſc. Taurin.</hi> vol. <lb/>V. p. 36. The red colour of the blood has been
        thought <lb/>by ſome to be cauſed by this attrition in the lungs; but <lb/><hi rend="sc"
          >lower</hi> refuted this notion, chiefly by obſerving, that the <lb/>attrition of the
        blood is greater in the muſcles, from <lb/>which, however, it always returns black,<hi
          rend="italic"> Ibid.</hi> vol. I. p. 74. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr. <hi rend="sc">whytt</hi> thought there was ſomething of a vital <lb/>and
        ſtimulating nature derived from the air into the <lb/>blood, by means of which it made the
        heart to contract, <lb/><hi rend="sc">haller</hi>, vol. III. p. 336. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="sc">boerhaave</hi> ſays, that air not changed is deadly; not <lb/>on account
        of heat, rarefaction, or denſity, but for ſome <lb/>other occult cauſe. <hi rend="italic"
          >Miſc. Taurin.</hi> vol. V. p. 30. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr. <hi rend="sc">hales</hi>, who has thrown much more light upon <lb/>the doctrine of
        air than all his predeceſſors, was equally <lb/>ignorant of the uſe of it in reſpiration;
        and at different <lb/>times ſeems to have adopted different opinions concern- <lb/>ing it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In his <hi rend="italic">Statical Eſſays</hi>, vol. II. p. 321. he ſuppoſes, that
        <lb/>air is rendered alcaline by breathing, and corrected, in <lb/>ſome meaſure, by the
        fumes of vinegar. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In agreement, as he obſerves, with <hi rend="sc">boerhaave</hi>, he ſays, <lb/>p. 100.
        that the blood acquires its warmth chiefly in the <lb/>lungs, where it moves with much
        greater rapidity than in <lb/>any other capillary veſſels of the body, vol. II. p. 87;
        <lb/>but that one uſe of the air is to cool the blood, p. 94; and <lb/>he makes an eſtimate
        of the degree of this refrigeration. <lb/>The red colour of the globules of blood, he ſays,
        p. 88, <pb n="231"/>
        <lb/>intimates their abounding with ſulphur, which makes <lb/>them more ſuſceptible and
        retentive of heat than thoſe <lb/>bodies which have leſs of it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>He alſo ſuppoſes, p. 102, that another great uſe of the <lb/>lungs is to attenuate and
        separate the globules of blood; <lb/>and that the floridneſs of the arterial blood above the
        ve- <lb/>nal may, in a good meaſure, be owing to the ſtrong agita- <lb/>tion, friction, and
        comminution, which it undergoes in <lb/>paſſing through them. In like manner, in a
        experiment <lb/>which he made for the purpoſe, blood much agitated in a <lb/>cloſe glaſs
        veſſel was obſerved to be very florid, not only <lb/>on its ſurface, but through its whole
        ſubſtance, as arterial <lb/>blood is, vol. II. p. 102. I would obſerve, however, that
        <lb/>in this expement, the blood muſt have acquired its florid <lb/>colour from the air with
        which it was agitated. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>He adds, that it is probable, that the blood may, in the <lb/>lungs, receive ſome other
        important influence from the <lb/>air, which is in ſuch great quantities inſpired into them.
        <lb/>In other places, however, he explodes the doctrine of a <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >vivifying ſpirit</hi> in the air. It has long, he ſays, been the <lb/>ſubject of inquiry
        to many, to find of what uſe it is in <lb/>reſpiration; which, though it may in ſome
        reſpects be <lb/>known, yet it muſt be confeſſed, that we are ſtill much <lb/>in the dark
        about it, vol. II. p. 102. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Suffocation, he ſays, vol. II. p. 271. conſiſts chiefly in <lb/>the falling flat of the
        lungs, occaſioned by the groſſneſs <lb/>of the particles of a thick noxious air, they being,
        in that <lb/>floating ſtate, moſt eaſily attracted by each other, as we find <lb/>that
        ſulphur, and the elaſtic repelling particles of air are; <pb n="232"/>
        <lb/>and conſequently unelaſtic, ſulphureous, ſaline, and other <lb/>floating particles,
        will moſt eaſily coaleſce, whereby they <lb/>are rendered too groſs to enter the minute
        veſicles, which <lb/>are alſo much contracted, as well by the loſs of the elaſti- <lb/>city
        of the confined air, as by the contraction occaſioned by <lb/>the ſtimulating acid
        ſulphureous vapours. And hence it <lb/>is not improbable, that one great deſign of nature in
        the <lb/>ſtructure of this important and wonderful <hi rend="italic">viſcus</hi>, was to

        <lb/>Lastly, he concludes, that the effect of reſpiration is to <lb/>abate, and in part
        deſtroy, the elaſticity of the air; and as <lb/>this was effected by <choice>

        <lb/><hi rend="sc">haller</hi>, after reciting the opinions of all that had <lb/>gone before

        ſtates his opinion concerning the uſe of <lb/>the lungs more fully, he ſays, that the true
        uſe of <lb/>them is partly inhaling, and partly exhaling, p. 351. <lb/>That the lungs inhale
        both water and air; but that in the <lb/>lungs the air loſes its elaſtic property, ſo as to
        be eaſily <lb/>ſoluble in water of vapour, p. 352.: and he thinks it <pb n="233"/>
        <lb/>probable, that this air ſerves as a cement to bind the <lb/>earthy parts together. He
        alſo makes no doubt, but that <lb/>various other matters, miſcible with water, are inhaled
        <lb/>by the lungs; and he even thinks it not improbable, that <lb/>the air may carry ſome
        electric virtue along with it. The <lb/>principal exhalation of the lungs, he thinks, to be
        water, <lb/>abounding with oily, volatile, and ſaline principles; and <lb/>theſe oily and

        <lb/>Mr. <hi rend="sc">cigna</hi> of Turin, has given much attention to this <lb/>curious
        ſubject, as appears by two Memoirs of his; one <lb/>in the firſt volume of the <hi

        <lb/>He takes it for granted, that air which has once been <lb/>breathed is unfit for
        farther reſpiration, on no other ac- <lb/>count than its being loaded with <hi rend="italic"

        <lb/>of air is diminiſhed by reſpiration, though he does not <lb/>conſider that diminution
        of elaſticity as the cauſe of its <lb/>noxious quality. He therefore concludes, that air
        which <lb/>has been breathed, ſuffocates by means of the irritation <lb/>which it occaſions
        to the lungs, by which the bronchia, <lb/>and the lungs themſelves, are contracted, ſo as to
        reſiſt the <lb/>entrance of the air; and therefore, that reſpired air is <pb n="234"/>
        <lb/>noxious on the ſame account as mephitic vapours, or thoſe <lb/>of burning brimſtone, p.

        <lb/>This philoſopher ſuppoſes that air enters the pores of <lb/>the blood, retaining its

        eſcape is <lb/>counteracted by the equal preſſure of the ambient me- <lb/>dium, p. 52. This
        air, he ſuppoſes to be introduced into <lb/>the blood by the chyle, and never by the way of
        the <lb/>lungs, except when, by ſome means or other, the equili- <lb/>brium between the air
        in the blood and the external air <lb/>is loſt, p. 57. If the external air be rarer than the

        <lb/>What we are chiefly indebted to M. <hi rend="sc">cigna</hi> for, is his <lb/>deciſive
        experiments with reſpect to the florid colour of <lb/>the blood, which he clearly proves to
        be cauſed by the <lb/>contact of air; though he afterwards ſeems willing to de- <lb/>ſert
        that hypotheſis. It was often imagined, that the <lb/>reaſon why the lower part of a
        quantity of blood was <lb/>black, while the ſurface was red, was, that the black par-
        <lb/>ticles, being heavier than the reſt, ſubſided to the bot- <lb/>tom; but this opinion
        our author clearly refutes. He <lb/>found, that when he put a little oil upon a quantity of
        <lb/>blood, it remained black throughout; but that when he <lb/>took away the red part, and
        expoſed to the air the lower <pb n="235"/>
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">laminæ</hi>, which were black, they alſo became ſucceſſively
        <lb/>red, till the whole maſs acquired that colour, <hi rend="italic">Miſc. Tau-
          <lb/>rin.</hi> vol. I. p. 73. Alſo, at the requeſt of M. <hi rend="sc">cigna</hi>, Fa-
        <lb/>ther <hi rend="sc">beccaria</hi> tried what would be the effect of expoſing <lb/>blood
        in <hi rend="italic">vacuo</hi>; and he found, that in thoſe circum- <lb/>ſtances, it always
        continued black; but that, by expoſing <lb/>it again to the air, it became red, p. 68. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>M. <hi rend="sc">cigna</hi> concludes his firſt diſſertation with obſerving, <lb/>that
        it is not eaſy to ſay how it comes to paſs, that the lower <lb/>part of a maſs of blood
        becomes black, whether by the air <lb/>which it had imbibed eſcaping from it, or by its
        depoſit- <lb/>ing ſomething ſaline, neceſſary to contribute to its red- <lb/>neſs, or by the
        preſſure of the atmoſphere; but he in- <lb/>clines to think, that air mixed with blood, and
        interpoſed <lb/>between the globules, preſerves its redneſs: but that by <lb/>concreting it
        is expelled from it, or becomes ſo fixed as <lb/>to be incapable of making it red. This
        opinion, he <lb/>thinks, is rendered in ſome meaſure probable, by the in- <lb/>creaſed
        denſity of concreted blood, and by the emiſſion <lb/>of air from other fluids in a
        concreſcent ſtate, p. 74. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Notwithſtanding what he had advanced in his firſt <lb/>Memoir, yet in the ſecond, which
        was written ſeveral years <lb/>after it, he doubts whether the change of colour in the
        <lb/>blood takes place in the lungs; but if it does, he inclines <lb/>to aſcribe this effect
        to the <hi rend="italic">evaporation</hi> from the blood <lb/>in the lungs: and though he
        always found, that the co- <lb/>lour of the blood was changed by the contact of air, yet
        <lb/>when he conſidered that evaporation muſt, as he thought, <lb/>neceſſarily attend the
        contact of air, he imagined, that this <pb n="236"/>
        <lb/>effect might equally be attributed to this circumſtance. <lb/>But he acknowledges, that
        this hypotheſis ought not to <lb/>be received till it be confirmed by experiments, <hi
          rend="italic">Miſc. <lb/>Taurin.</hi> vol. V. p. 61. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Upon the whole, he concludes, that the principal uſe of <lb/>air to the <hi
          rend="italic">blood</hi>, is to preſerve the equilibrium with the ex- <lb/>ternal air, and
        to prevent the veſſels from being rendered <lb/>unfit to tranſmit the blood, on account of
        the external <lb/>preſſure; whereas, by means of the air they contain, the <lb/>fluids move
        in their proper veſſels as freely as in <hi rend="italic">vacuo</hi>, <lb/>and the membranes
        and viſcera alſo eaſily ſlide over each <lb/>other, p. 63. And with reſpect to the uſe of
        the <hi rend="italic">lungs</hi>, <lb/>ſince he imagined that air is not introduced into the
        blood <lb/>by means of them, he thinks, that becauſe ſuch lungs as <lb/>thoſe of man are
        given to the warmer animals only, the <lb/>chief uſe of reſpiration is exhalation, and
        conſequently <lb/>the cooling of the blood, p. 65. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The laſt writer whom I ſhall quote upon this ſubject, <lb/>is the late ingenious Mr.
          <hi rend="sc">hewson</hi>; who ſays, in his <hi rend="italic">Ex- <lb/>perimental Inquiry
          into the Properties of Blood</hi>, p. 9. <lb/>
        <q rend="diple quotes">As the colour of the blood is changed by air out of the <lb/>body, it
          is preſumed, that the air in the lungs is the <lb/>immediate cauſe of the ſame change in
          the body. </q>
        <lb/>That this change is really produced in the lungs, he is <lb/>perſuaded, he ſays, from
        experiments, in which he diſ- <lb/>tinctly ſaw the blood of a more florid red in the left
        au- <lb/>ricle of the heart than it was in the right; but how this <lb/>effect is produced,
        he ſays, is not yet determined. </p>
      <pb n="237"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Since ſome of the neutral ſalts, and particularly <lb/>nitre, has a ſimilar effect on
        the colour of the blood; <lb/>ſome, ſays he, attribute this difference to the nitre ab-
        <lb/>ſorbed from the air, while in the lungs. But this, he <lb/>adds, is a mere hypotheſis,
        for air contains no nitre, <lb/>and moſt of the neutral ſalts produce the ſame effect in
        <lb/>ſome degree. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Since, however, a ſolution of nitre does produce this <lb/>effect upon blood, inſtantly
        making the very blackeſt of <lb/>it of a beautiful florid red, though this effect is not pe-
        <lb/>culiar to nitre (for a ſolution of common ſalt does nearly <lb/>the ſame thing) I own I
        am inclined to aſcribe this effect <lb/>to the air; eſpecially ſince I have proved, as I
        apprehend, <lb/>that atmoſpherical air conſiſts of earth and ſpirit of nitre. <lb/>Poſſibly,
        therefore, the air we breathe may be ſo far de- <lb/>compoſed, as to communicate ſomething
        of nitre to the <lb/>blood, in its paſſage through the lungs. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>After this review of the obſervations and opinions of <lb/>others on this important
        queſtion in phyſiology, I ſhall <lb/>proceed to recite my own. It may appear ſomething ex-
        <lb/>traordinary, that among ſuch a variety of opinions concern- <lb/>ing the uſe of
        reſpiration, the right one ſhould never have <lb/>been ſo much as conjectured, though
        unſupported by the <lb/>proper proof. But indeed, this animal function, and the
        <lb/>phlogiſtic proceſſes in chemiſtry, eſpecially that of the <lb/>calcination of metals,
        which is, perhaps, the moſt ſimple <lb/>of them, are to appearance very different things;
        and <lb/>therefore, it is the leſs to be wondered, that no perſon <pb n="238"/>
        <lb/>ſhould have imagined, they would produce the ſame <lb/>effect on the air in which they
        were performed. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>That reſpiration, however, is, in reality, a true phlogiſtic <lb/>proceſs, cannot, I
        think, admit of a doubt, after its being <lb/>found, that the air which has ſerved for this
        purpoſe is <lb/>left in preciſely the ſame ſtate as that which has been ex- <lb/>poſed to
        any other phlogiſtic proceſs. And ſince all the <lb/>blood in the body paſſes through the
        lungs, and, accord- <lb/>ing to Mr.<hi rend="sc"> hewson</hi>'s obſervations and others, the
        re- <lb/>markable change between the colour of the venal and <lb/>arterial blood takes place
        there, it can hardly be doubted, <lb/>that it is by means of the <hi rend="italic"
          >blood</hi> that the air becomes <lb/>phlogiſticated in paſſing through the lungs; and
        there- <lb/>fore, that one great uſe of the blood muſt be to diſcharge <lb/>the phlogiſton
        with which the animal ſyſtem abounds, <lb/>imbibing it in the courſe of its circulation, and
        imparting <lb/>it to the air, with which it is nearly brought into contact, <lb/>in the
        lungs; the air thus acting as the great menſtruum <lb/>for this purpoſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Though I had no doubt concerning this concluſion <lb/>from my former experiments, I
        thought ſo great a pro- <lb/>blem deſerved as much illuſtration as could be given to it;
        <lb/>and therefore I was willing to try, whether the blood was <lb/>of ſuch a nature, as to
        retain any of this power of affec- <lb/>ing air when congealed, and out of the body, that it
        has <lb/>when it is fluid, and in the body; and the experiments <lb/>have fully anſwered my
        expectations. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Having taken the blood of a ſheep, and let it ſtand till <lb/>it was coagulated, and
        the ſerum was ſeparated from it <lb/>(after which the ſurface, being expoſed to the common
          <pb n="239"/>
        <lb/>air, is well known to aſſume a florid red colour, while the <lb/>inſide is of a much
        darker red, bordering upon black) I <lb/>introduced pieces of the craſſamentum, contained in
        nets <lb/>of open gauze, or of wire, ſometimes through water, and <lb/>ſometimes through
        quickſilver, into different kinds of air, <lb/>and always found that the blackeſt parts
        aſſumed a florid <lb/>red colour in common air, and more eſpecially in de-
        <lb/>phlogiſticated air, which is purer and more fit for reſpi- <lb/>ration than common air
        (and accordingly the blood al- <lb/>ways acquired a more florid colour, and the change was
        <lb/>produced in leſs time in this than in common air) whereas <lb/>the brighteſt red blood
        became preſently black in any <lb/>kind of air that was unfit for reſpiration, as in fixed
        air, <lb/>inflammable air, nitrous air, or phlogiſticated air; and <lb/>after becoming black
        in the laſt of theſe kinds of air, it <lb/>regained its red colour upon being again expoſed
        to com- <lb/>mon air, or dephlogiſticated air; the ſame pieces becom- <lb/>ing alternately
        black and red, by being transferred from <lb/>phlogiſticated to dephlogiſticated air; and
          <hi rend="italic">vice verſâ</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In theſe experiments the blood muſt have parted with <lb/>its phlogiſton to the common
        air, or dephlogiſticated air, <lb/>and have imbibed it, and have become ſaturated with it,
        <lb/>when expoſed to phlogiſticated, nitrous, inflammable, or <lb/>fixed air. The only
        difficulty is with reſpect to the fixed <lb/>air; for all the other kinds certainly contain
        phlogiſton. <lb/>But, as I have obſerved in the account of my experi- <lb/>ments on
        vitriolic acid air, phlogiſton ſeems to be neceſ- <lb/>ſary to the conſitution of every kind
        of air; and beſides, <lb/>the blackneſs of the blood may ariſe from other cauſes <pb n="240"/>
        <lb/>than its acquiring phlogiſton. <hi rend="sc">gaber</hi>, for inſtance, ob- <lb/>ſerves,
        that blood becomes black when it begins to pu- <lb/>trify, as does alſo whenever it is dried
        and hardened <lb/>near the fire. Father <hi rend="sc">beccaria</hi> alſo found, as I have
        ob- <lb/>ſerved, that red blood <hi rend="italic">continued</hi> (and he could hardly fail
        <lb/>to obſerve alſo, that it <hi rend="italic">became</hi>) black in <hi rend="italic"
          >vacuo</hi>, where it <lb/>could not have imbibed phlogiſton. This I found to be <lb/>the
        caſe when the blood was covered two inches and a <lb/>half with ſerum; but it regained its
        florid colour when <lb/>it was expoſed to the open air. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In general, however, it cannot be expected, that when <lb/>blood has become black
        without having received phlo- <lb/>giſton <hi rend="italic">ab extra</hi>, it will recover
        its florid colour by being <lb/>expoſed to the air. For the delicacy of its texture, and
        <lb/>conſequently its capacity of being eaſily affected by phlo- <lb/>giſton, may be
        eſſentially altered by internal cauſes of <lb/>blackneſs. This is even the caſe when blood
        has become <lb/>black by being expoſed to nitrous and inflammable air, <lb/>though this
        change is probably effected by its imbibing <lb/>phlogiſton. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I expoſed pieces of the ſame maſs of red blood to theſe <lb/>two kinds of air, and alſo
        to fixed air at the ſame time. <lb/>They all became black: but that which was in the in-
        <lb/>flammable air was the leaſt ſo, and none of them reco- <lb/>vered their florid colour
        in the open air. But at another <lb/>time, a piece of craſſamentum, which had become black
        <lb/>in fixed air, did, in ſome meaſure, and very ſlowly, reco- <lb/>ver its florid colour
        in dephlogiſticated air. Perhaps <lb/>the pieces that had loſt their colour in the nitrous
        and <pb n="241"/>
        <lb/>inflammable air might have recovered it by means of this <lb/>more powerful menſtruum. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Since, however, blood, after becoming black in phlo- <lb/>giſticated air, is always
        capable of reſuming its red co- <lb/>lour on being again expoſed to pure air, it may be con-
        <lb/>cluded, that the preceding blackneſs, diſcharged in the <lb/>pure air, and producing
        the conſtant effect of phlogiſton, <lb/>in depraving the air, was owing to the phlogiſton it
        had <lb/>imbibed in the former ſituation, and which it parted with <lb/>in the latter. And
        this is remarkably the caſe when <lb/>blood is transferred from phlogiſticated into
        dephlogiſti- <lb/>cated air. Even the circumſtance of the <hi rend="italic">deeper
          colour</hi> is <lb/>ſufficient to give a chemiſt a ſuſpicion that it contains <lb/>more
        phlogiſton than blood of a lighter colour. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When I had found how readily pieces of blood changed <lb/>their colour, according to
        the quality of the air to which <lb/>they were expoſed, I proceeded to examine the ſtate of
        <lb/>that air, in order to obſerve what change had taken place <lb/>in it; and as
        dephlogiſticated air admits of a more ſenſi- <lb/>ble change of quality than common air, I
        gave it the pre- <lb/>ference in this experiment; putting a piece of craſſa- <lb/>mentum,
        about the bigneſs of a walnut, into the quantity <lb/>of about five ounce meaſures of this
        air. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This proceſs I continued for the ſpace of twenty-four <lb/>hours, changing the blood
        about ten or twelve times; <lb/>after which I found the air ſo far depraved, that whereas,
        <lb/>at the beginning of the experiment, one meaſure of it and <lb/>two of nitrous air
        occupied the ſpace of no more than <lb/>half a meaſure, the ſame mixtures afterwards
        occupied <pb n="242"/>
        <lb/>the ſpace of a meaſure and a half. Now ſince air is uni- <lb/>verſally depraved by
        phlogiſton, and in this ſenſe, I be- <lb/>lieve, by nothing elſe, it is evident, that this
        black blood <lb/>muſt have communicated phlogiſton to the air; and con- <lb/>ſequently its
        change of colour from black to a florid red <lb/>muſt have been occaſioned by the ſeparation
        of phlo- <lb/>giſton from it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The next day, when, of courſe, the blood was nearer <lb/>to the ſtate of putrefaction,
        in which every kind of ſub- <lb/>ſtance, without exception, will injure reſpirable air, I
        put <lb/>a quantity of red blood, tinged in a few places with black, <lb/>which I could not
        eaſily ſeparate from it, to about the ſame <lb/>quantity of the ſame dephlogiſticated air,
        and ſuffered it <lb/>to ſtand, without changing, for the ſame ſpace of time; <lb/>when it
        was ſo little injured, that the meaſures abovemen- <lb/>tioned occupied the ſpace of only
        two-thirds of a meaſure. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>That blood has a power of taking phlogiſton from <lb/>air, as well as imparting

          <corr>one</corr>
          <sic>cne</sic>
        </choice> of this occupied the ſpace of 2¼, inſtead of 1¾ mea- <lb/>ſures. The inflammable
        air, though ſtill inflammable, <pb n="243"/>
        <lb/>was rendered in ſome degree wholeſome by the proceſs; <lb/>being, after this,
        conſiderably diminiſhed by nitrous air, <lb/>which is a ſtate to which it is brought by
        agitation in <lb/>water, and which, continued longer, deprives it of its in-
        <lb/>flammability likewiſe. It cannot be doubted, therefore, <lb/>but that, in both theſe
        caſes, the red blood, by becoming <lb/>black, received phlogiſton from theſe two kinds of
        air. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>With reſpect to the phlogiſticated air, I only obſerved <lb/>that, after a few hours
        expoſure to the red blood, it was <lb/>ſenſibly, but not much, diminiſhed by nitrous air,
        which <lb/>otherwiſe it would not have been in the leaſt degree. <lb/>This blood, however,
        was of the lighteſt colour; that is, <lb/>according to my hypotheſis, the moſt free from
        phlo- <lb/>giſton, of any that I have ever ſeen; and I have tried the <lb/>ſame thing,
        without ſucceſs, with blood of a leſs florid <lb/>colour, though as florid as the common air
        could make it. <lb/>But it ſhould be conſidered, that the proper function of the <lb/>blood
        is not to receive phlogiſton from <hi rend="italic">air</hi>, not meeting <lb/>with any
        phlogiſticated air in the courſe of its circula- <lb/>tion, but to communicate phlogiſton to
        air; and there- <lb/>fore, there is by no means the ſame reaſon to expect, that <lb/>air
        will be mended by red blood, as that it will be injured <lb/>by black blood. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It may be objected to this hypotheſis, concerning the <lb/>uſe of the blood, that it
        never comes into actual contact <lb/>with the air in the lungs, but is ſeparated from it,
        though <lb/>as Dr. <hi rend="sc">hales</hi> ſtates it, at the diſtance of no more than a
        <lb/>thouſandth part of an inch. The red globules alſo ſwim <pb n="244"/>
        <lb/>in a large quantity of ſerum, which is a fluid of a quite <lb/>different nature. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In order to aſcertain the effect of theſe circumſtances, <lb/>I took a large quantity
        of black blood, and put it into a <lb/>bladder moiſtened with a little ſerum, and tying it
        very <lb/>cloſe, hung it in a free expoſure to the air, though in a <lb/>quieſcent ſtate;
        and the next day I found, upon exami- <lb/>nation, that all the lower ſurface of the blood,
        which had <lb/>been ſeparated from the common air by the intervention <lb/>of the bladder
        (which is an animal membrane, ſimilar to <lb/>that which conſtitutes the veſicles of the
        lungs, and is at <lb/>leaſt as thick) and likewiſe a little ſerum, had acquired a
        <lb/>coating of a florid red colour, and as thick, I believe, as <lb/>it would have
        acquired, if it had been immediately ex- <lb/>poſed to the open air; ſo that this membrane
        had been no <lb/>impediment to the action of the air upon the blood. In <lb/>this caſe it is
        evident to obſerve, that the change of co- <lb/>lour could not be owing to <hi rend="italic"
          >evaporation</hi>, as Mr. <hi rend="sc">cigna</hi> con- <lb/>jectures. This experiment I
        repeated, without previouſly <lb/>moiſtening the bladder, and with the very ſame reſult. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I obſerved alſo, that when I cut out a piece of the <lb/>craſſamentum, and left the
        remainder in the veſſel <lb/>with the <hi rend="italic">ſerum</hi>, not only that part of
        the ſurface which <lb/>was expoſed to the air, but that which was ſurrounded <lb/>with <hi
          rend="italic">ſerum</hi>, and even covered with it to the depth of ſe- <lb/>veral inches,
        acquired the florid colour; ſo that this deep <lb/>covering of ſerum, which muſt have
        effectually prevented <lb/>all evaporation, was no more an impediment to the mu- <lb/>tual
        action of the blood and the air, than the bladder had <pb n="245"/>
        <lb/>been. The ſerum of the blood, therefore, appears to be <lb/>as wonderfully adapted to
        anſwer its purpoſe, of a vehicle <lb/>for the red globules, as the red globules themſelves:
        for <lb/>the ſlighteſt covering of water, or <hi rend="italic">ſaliva</hi>, effectually pre-
        <lb/>vents the blood from acquiring its florid colour; and Mr. <lb/><hi rend="sc">cigna</hi>
        found that this was the caſe when it was covered <lb/>with oil. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>That it is really the air, acting through the ſerum, and <lb/>not the ſerum itſelf,
        that gives the florid colour to the blood, <lb/>is clearly aſcertained by the following
        experiment. I <lb/>took two equal portions of black blood, and put them <lb/>into equal
        cups, containing equal quantities of ſerum, <lb/>which covered them to the depth of half an
        inch. One <lb/>of theſe cups ſtanding in the open air, and the other being <lb/>placed under
        an exhauſted receiver, the former preſently <lb/>acquired a florid colour, while the other
        continued twelve <lb/>hours as black as at firſt. Being taken out of the receiver, <lb/>it
        ſtood all night in the open air without becoming red, <lb/>and continued black ever after,
        even when the ſerum was <lb/>poured off. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I alſo more completely ſatisfied myſelf of the influence <lb/>of the air upon the
        blood, through a body of ſerum, by <lb/>the reverſe of this experiment. For I found that red
        <lb/>blood became black through the depth of two inches of <lb/>ſerum, when the veſſel
        containing it was expoſed to <lb/>phlogiſticated air; ſo that the red globules of the blood
        <lb/>both receive, and part with phlogiſton by means of the <lb/>air, notwithſtanding the
        interpoſition of a large body of <lb/>the fluid in which they naturally float. </p>
      <pb n="246"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Except ſerum, <hi rend="italic">milk</hi> is the only animal fluid that I have
        <lb/>tried, through which the air can act upon blood: for <lb/>black blood became red when
        it was plunged in milk, in <lb/>the ſame manner as if it had been covered with ſerum. In
        <lb/>urine, indeed, black blood becomes inſtantly red; but <lb/>this is not owing to the
        action of the air, through the <lb/>urine, but to the ſaline nature of that fluid. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In ſome caſes, care muſt be taken to diſtinguiſh the <lb/>floridneſs with which ſome
        detached parts of a quantity <lb/>of blood are tinged, from that which penetrates the ſolid
        <lb/>parts of it. In <hi rend="italic">ſaliva</hi>, and in water impregnated with
        <lb/>alkaline ſalt, fixed or volatile, and alſo in ſpirit of wine, <lb/>the extreme angles
        and edges of pieces of craſſamentum <lb/>and ſmall detached parts, floating in thoſe
        liquors, will <lb/>appear of a very florid red, while the compact maſs of <lb/>blood
        continues dark. The florid colour of the promi- <lb/>nent and detached parts, in theſe
        caſes, ſeems to be the <lb/>mere effect of the minute diviſion of the parts of the
        <lb/>craſſamentum in the fluid in which thoſe parts float; <lb/>when at the ſame time it has
        no ſuch effect on thoſe <lb/>parts which remain compact, nor has the air the leaſt
        <lb/>power of acting on the blood through the liquor. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I had imagined, that ſince black blood contains more <lb/>phlogiſton than red blood,
        that difference would have <lb/>appeared in the <hi rend="italic">air</hi> produced from
        them, either by being <lb/>ſimply diſſolved in ſpirit of nitre, or when dried and <lb/>made
        into a paſte with that acid. But the difference was <lb/>too ſmall to be ſenſible to this
        kind of teſt. For this <lb/>purpoſe, however, I had ſome blood drawn from the vein <pb
          n="247"/>
        <lb/>of a ſheep, and alſo took ſome that came firſt after killing <lb/>it, as the butchers
        uſually do, by dividing the <hi rend="italic">carotid</hi> ar- <lb/>tery; but though I
        diſſolved the black part of the for- <lb/>mer, and the red part of the latter, in equal
        quantities of <lb/>the ſame ſpirit of nitre, I found no ſenſible difference in <lb/>the air
        that they yielded. The air that I got from them <lb/>when dried, and made into a paſte with
        ſpirit of nitre, <lb/>was likewiſe equally indiſtinguiſhable. The quantity of <lb/>air from
        this proceſs was very great, and was produced <lb/>irregularly, as I have obſerved it to
        have been when pro- <lb/>duced by a ſolution in ſpirit of nitre without drying. <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Obſervations on Air</hi>, vol. II. p. 155. Half of this pro- <lb/>duce was
        fixed air, and the reſt phlogiſticated, except that <lb/>a candle burned in it with a
        lambent blue flame. It is <lb/>evident, however, from this experiment, that even the
        <lb/>moſt florid blood contains a conſiderable quantity of <lb/>phlogiſton; for, otherwiſe,
        this air would have been de- <lb/>phlogiſticated. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I would conclude this paper with obſerving, that I <lb/>have found a very great
        difference in the conſtitution of <lb/>blood with reſpect to its property of being affected
        by the <lb/>influence of the air; ſome becoming very ſoon of a light <lb/>florid colour, and
        the <hi rend="italic">ſtratum</hi> of this colour ſoon grow- <lb/>ing very thick; whereas,
        in other caſes, the colour of <lb/>the blood, in the moſt favourable circumſtances, has con-
        <lb/>tinued much darker, and the lighter colour have never <lb/>penetrated very far. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As the principal uſe of the blood ſeems to be its power <lb/>of receiving and
        diſcharging phlogiſton, and the degree <pb n="248"/>
        <lb/>in which it poſſeſſes this power is eaſily aſcertained by <lb/>the eye, it might not,
        perhaps, be unworthy of being par- <lb/>ticularly attended to by phyſicians. To eſtimate the
        <lb/>goodneſs of blood, according to this criterion, nothing is <lb/>requiſite but to
        obſerve the lightneſs of the colour, and <lb/>the depth of the light-coloured <hi
          rend="italic">ſtratum</hi>, after it has been <lb/>expoſed to the air for a given time. In
        caſes in which <lb/>the blood is unuſually black, and but little affected by <lb/>common
        air, it ſhould ſeem, that breathing a purer air <lb/>might be preſcribed with advantage. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In general, the blood that I have been able to procure <lb/>in the city has not been ſo
        good as that which I have got <lb/>in the country; owing, perhaps, to the cattle having been
        <lb/>much driven, and heated before they were killed. </p>
