          </note><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi> Young woman of Aiton, a village <lb/>about two miles from
          this place, <lb/>had her right leg drawn back by a contraction of <lb/>the muſcles that
          bend the knee, ſo that ſhe had not <lb/>been able to put that foot to the ground for near
          a <lb/>twelvemonth. She had taken the advice of ſome <lb/>Surgeons in the country, and had
          uſed ſeveral reme- <lb/>dies to no purpoſe. At laſt, hearing of the cure of <lb/>the
          paralytic woman, whoſe caſe I ſent you ſome <lb/>time ago, ſhe inſiſted on being brought
          hither; and <lb/>underwent a courſe of electrical ſhocks for near two <lb/>months,
          receiving every day at leaſt fifty or ſixty in <lb/>the following manner. She ſat cloſe by
          the machine, <lb/>and graſping the phial in her hand, ſhe preſented the <lb/>wire to the
          barrel or conductor, and drew the ſparks <lb/>from it for about half a minute. The phial
          being <lb/>thus charged, ſhe then touched her knee with the wire, <lb/>and thereby
          received ſuch ſevere ſtrokes, as would <lb/>ſometimes inſtantly raiſe a bliſter on the
          part. The <lb/>joint was at laſt ſo much relaxed, as that ſhe chould <lb/>walk home with
          the help of a crutch, tho' her leg <lb/>was ſo weak, that ſhe had very little uſe of it.
          After <pb n="696"/>
          <lb/>ſhe had continued in this ſtate for ſome weeks, ſhe <lb/>was adviſed to uſe the cold
          bath: but that ſoon <lb/>brought back the contraction; and I have been ſince <lb/>informed
          that ſhe was worſe than ever. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>A ſoldier's wife, a genteel looking woman, of about <lb/>30 years of age, was ſeized
          with a ſlight palſy, about <lb/>Newcaſtle, on her way to this country: but before <lb/>ſhe
          got to this place, ſhe had loſt all the feeling in <lb/>her left ſide, and ſo far the
          power of it, that ſhe <lb/>was brought to us in a cart. After receiving 600 <lb/>ſtrokes
          from the electrical machine in the uſual way, <lb/>and in the ſpace of two days, ſhe
          recovered the uſe <lb/>of her ſide, and ſet out on foot to make out the reſt <lb/>of her
          journey. However, for fear of a relapſe, I <lb/>gave her a recommendatory letter to Mr.
          Sommer, <lb/>Surgeon at Haddington, as ſhe was to paſs thro' that <lb/>town, and as I knew
          that he was likewiſe provided <lb/>with an electrical apparatus. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>A young woman from <hi rend="italic">Home</hi>, a village in this <lb/>ſhire, but at
          a good diſtance, complained of a cold- <lb/>neſs and inſenſibility in her left hand and
          wriſt, of <lb/>two years ſtanding. When I felt that hand, it was <lb/>as cold as a ſtone,
          whilſt the other was ſweating; and <lb/>ſhe told me, that it never had been warmer all
          that <lb/>time. I made her draw the ſparks from an egg (which <lb/>for ſome other purpoſe
          was ſuſpended by a wire <lb/>from the conductor) for about half an hour; and at <lb/>the
          end of that time I found the dead hand in a far <lb/>greater ſweat than the other. She
          then wrapt it up <lb/>in a piece of flannel, as ſhe uſed to do, and retired. <lb/>Next day
          ſhe told me, that ſince the operation ſhe <lb/>had been able to put off and on her cloaths
          without <pb n="697"/>
          <lb/>help, which ſhe had not been able to do for a <lb/>twelvemonth before. She was again
          electriſed; and <lb/>believing ſhe was then quite well, ſhe went away: <lb/>but ſome weeks
          after, upon the coldneſs of her hand <lb/>beginning to return, ſhe made me another viſit,
          was <lb/>again electriſed, and was diſmiſſed a ſecond time <lb/>apparently cured. This is
          about two months ago, <lb/>and I have heard nothing of her ſince. </p>
        <p rend="indent space">
          <lb/>As theſe two laſt women are at ſuch diſtance, I <lb/>cannot pretend to ſend you their
          own teſtimony of <lb/>their cure. But for the two caſes in the ſeparate <lb/>paper, as the
          perſons are inhabitants of this place, I <lb/>have taken care that they themſelves ſhould
          ſign them, <lb/>along with my father; ſince you have acquainted me, <lb/>that accounts of
          this kind ſhould have the atteſtation <lb/>both of the patients and the miniſter of the
          pariſh. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>I ſhall only add here, that ſeveral perſons have <lb/>been relieved of rheumatic
          pains, by electriſing the <lb/>parts affected. And a woman was cured of a deaf- <lb/>neſs
          of ſix months ſtanding, contracted, as ſhe ima- <lb/>gined, by cold. This woman held the
          phial in her <lb/>hand, whilſt another perſon ſtanding on a cake of <lb/>reſin gave her
          the ſhock, by putting the end of the <lb/>wire into her ear. This manner of electriſing
          brought <lb/>always on a profuſe ſweat over the head, which we <lb/>encouraged, by
          wrapping it up in flannel. The firſt <lb/>day ſhe came here, ſhe could ſcarce hear what
          was <lb/>ſpoken by thoſe about her; but in five days ſhe <lb/>ſeemed to be perfectly
          cured. </p>
