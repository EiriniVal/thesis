        Lordſhip's Letter, <lb/>of the 19th of February, and your inquiries concern- <lb/>ing
        William Carey, the oſſified young man; but as <lb/>your letter came to me in the country,
        where I was <pb n="144"/>
        <lb/>at a conſiderable diſtance from all opportunities of <lb/>making a full and
        ſatisfactory inquiry, I judged, that <lb/>it would be more acceptable to your Lordſhip, that
        I <lb/>ſhould defer giving you trouble, until I could give <lb/>you a ſatisfactory anſwer. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In March 1759, I had this young man brought <lb/>up to Dublin, and admitted into
        Mercer's hoſpital. <lb/>The phyſicians and ſurgeons put him under a ſali- <lb/>vation; and
        afterwards applied, to his arms and joints, <lb/>mercurial plaiſters. The good effects of
        this proceſs, <lb/>was the drying up the great diſcharge of humour, <lb/>which he had at his
        elbows and wriſts, and an im- <lb/>mediate check to the progreſs of the oſſification. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In June following, he was diſcharged from the <lb/>hoſpital, being furniſhed with
        mercurial plaiſters, <lb/>and directions. By the advice of the phyſicians, he <lb/>went to
        his own place, near Ballyſhanon, on the <lb/>weſtern ocean; and there, in purſuance of their
        di- <lb/>rections, bathed in the ocean twice a day, during <lb/>that whole ſummer and
        harveſt, and conſtantly <lb/>rubbed his whole body and limbs over with the juice <lb/>of the
        quercus marina, immediately after coming <lb/>out of the ſea. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In conſequence of this courſe, he happily ex- <lb/>changed his ghaſtly hectic
        countenance, for an <lb/>healthy and athletic complexion, which continued <lb/>until March
        1760. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>About this time his cough returned, his ſores be- <lb/>gan to run, and the oſſification
        to return. In this <lb/>diſtreſs, he came to me to Dublin. With ſome dif- <lb/>ficulty I got
        him admitted again into Mercer's hoſpi- <lb/>tal; where he continued for ſome months, and
        was <lb/>again treated with mercurial medicines and applica- <pb n="145"/>
        <lb/>tions, as before. After being diſcharged, he returned <lb/>to his former courſe of
        bathing in the ocean, and <lb/>anointing his body with the quercus marina. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This proceſs reſtored his health, and intirely <lb/>ſtopped the progreſs of the
        oſſification. He alſo re- <lb/>covered the uſe of ſome of the oſſified joints, par-
        <lb/>ticularly of his wriſts and fingers; and his knees and <lb/>legs grew ſo relaxed, by
        the diſſolution of the callus, <lb/>that he was able to walk twenty miles in a day. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I feared, that his diſorder might return this ſpring, <lb/>as it did in 1760; but it
        has not returned. That I <lb/>might be the better certified, I wrote to Sir James
        <lb/>Caldwell. The anſwer I received was, that he had <lb/>been, a few days ago, at
        Caſtlecaldwell, and found <lb/>himſelf ſo well and ſtrong, as to importune Sir James <lb/>to
        admit him into his body of the Enniſkillen light- <lb/>horſe. The poor man thinks the
        oſſification intirely <lb/>ſtopped; yet, by the appearance of his arms and wriſts, <lb/>he
        ſeems to be miſtaken. The firſt hardneſs ſtill con- <lb/>tinues; and all the muſcles from
        his elbow to the <lb/>wriſt, ſeem to be one ſolid bone. It is very happy <lb/>for him, that
        it has been hitherto ſtopped from pro- <lb/>ceeding any farther; and that, from his preſent
        ſtate <lb/>of good health, there is reaſon to hope, that it will <lb/>not increaſe. I am, </p>
