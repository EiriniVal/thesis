          </note><hi rend="dc(2)">J</hi>Oſeph, ſon of John and Mary Poſtle, <lb/>of Ingham in the
          county of Norfolk, <lb/>was ſubject to convulſive fits from his infancy; <lb/>which were
          common and tolerable till he was about <lb/>ſeven years of age. About that time they began
          to <lb/>attack him in all the varieties that can be conceived. <lb/>Sometimes he was
          thrown upon the ground; ſome- <lb/>times he was twirled round like a top by them; at
          <lb/>others he would ſpring upwards to a conſiderable <lb/>height, <hi rend="italic"
            >&amp;c.</hi> and once he leaped over an iron bar, <lb/>that was placed purpoſely before
          the fire to prevent <lb/>his falling into it. He was much burned; but was <lb/>rendered ſo
          habitually ſtupid by his fits, that he ne- <lb/>ver expreſſed the leaſt ſenſe of pain
          after this acci- <lb/>dent. His intellect was ſo much impaired, and al- <lb/>moſt
          deſtroyed, by the frequency and violence of his <lb/>fits, that he ſcarce ſeemed to be
          conſcious of any <lb/>thing. He did not acknowledge his father or mother <lb/>by any
          expreſſions or ſigns; nor ſeemed to diſtinguiſh <lb/>them from other people. If at any
          time he eſcaped <lb/>out of the houſe without the obſervation of the fa- <lb/>mily, he had
          not underſtanding to find and return to <lb/>it; but would purſue the direction or road he
          firſt <lb/>took, and ſometimes loſe himſelf. Once he was <lb/>miſſing for a whole night;
          and found the next <pb n="519"/>
          <lb/>morning in the middle of a fen, ſtuck flat in mud as <lb/>deep as his breaſt. He was
          very voracious, and would <lb/>frequently call for ſomething to eat; which was the
          <lb/>only indication he gave of his knowing any thing. No <lb/>kind of filth or naſtineſs
          can be conceived, which he <lb/>would not eat or drink without diſtinction. He ap-
          <lb/>peared to be as ill as he really was; for he was become <lb/>a moſt ſhocking
          ſpectacle. He was ſo much emaci- <lb/>ated, that he ſeemed to have no fleſh upon his
          bones; <lb/>and his body ſo diſtorted, that he was rendered quite <lb/>a cripple. His
          parents conſulted a phyſician at Nor- <lb/>wich, who very judiciouſly (as it will appear)
          con- <lb/>ſidered his diſorder as a worm-caſe, and preſcribed <lb/>for it accordingly; but
          (being afraid, I preſume, to <lb/>give too violent medicines to the boy) without ſuc-
          <lb/>ceſs. In ſhort, he was ſo ſingularly afflicted, that <lb/>his parents told me they
          could not help thinking him <lb/>under ſome evil influence. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>It was obſerved, that his diſorder varied, and grew <lb/>worſe, at certain periods of
          the moon. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>In theſe miſerable circumſtances the poor boy con- <lb/>tinued to languiſh, till he
          was about eleven years of <lb/>age (July 1757), when he accidentally found a mix-
          <lb/>ture of white lead <note n="*" place="bottom" rend="size(0.7)">
            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>* It is not improbable, that a conſiderable portion of whiting <lb/>might be uſed
              inſtead of pure white lead, which is frequently <lb/>done: and this ſuppoſition is
              favoured by the mixture's not proving <lb/>fatal to the boy, as ſuch a quantity of
              white lead in all probability <lb/>would. </p>
          </note> and oil, which had ſome time <lb/>before been prepared for ſome purpoſe of
          painting, <lb/>ſet by on a ſhelf, and placed, as it was thought, out <lb/>of his reach.
          There was near half a pint of this <lb/>mixture when he found it; and, as he did not leave
            <pb n="520"/>
          <lb/>much, it is thought he ſwallowed about a quarter <lb/>of a pint of it. There was alſo
          ſome lamp-black in <lb/>the compoſition; which was added to give it a pro- <lb/>per colour
          for the particular uſe it was intended for <lb/>in painting. It was, as I ſuppoſe it
          uſually is, linſeed <lb/>oil, which had been mixed with the lead and lamp- <lb/>black. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The draught began to operate very ſoon, by vomit- <lb/>ing and purging him for near
          24 hours in the moſt <lb/>violent manner. A large quantity of black inky <lb/>matter was
          diſcharged; and an infinite number of <lb/>worms, almoſt as ſmall as threads, were voided.
          <lb/>Theſe operations were ſo intenſe, that his life was <lb/>deſpaired of. But he has not
          only ſurvived them, <lb/>but experienced a moſt wonderful change and im- <lb/>provement
          after them: for his parents aſſured me in <lb/>November 1757, when I ſaw him, that he had
          daily <lb/>grown better from the time of his drinking the mix- <lb/>ture, both in body and
          mind. Inſtead of a ſkeleton, <lb/>as he almoſt was before, he is become fat, and ra-
          <lb/>ther corpulent: and his appetite is no longer raven- <lb/>ous, but moderate and
          common. His body too is <lb/>become ſtraight and erect. His underſtanding is at <lb/>leaſt
          as much benefited by this peculiar remedy. It <lb/>cannot be expected, that he ſhould
          already have at- <lb/>tained much knowledge, as he ſeemed, before he was <lb/>ſo
          wonderfully relieved, to be almoſt deſtitute of <lb/>ideas. But he appeared, when I ſaw
          him, to have <lb/>acquired nearly as much knowledge in four months, <lb/>as children
          uſually do in four years; and to reaſon <lb/>pretty well on thoſe things, which he knew.
          He is <lb/>now capable of being employed on many occaſions; <lb/>is often ſent a mile or
          two on errands, which he diſ- <pb n="521"/>
          <lb/>charges as carefully, and then returns as ſafely, as <lb/>any perſon. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>It is farther remarkable, that the boy's mother, <lb/>her father, and ſiſter, are
          frequently infeſted with <lb/>worms. Her father, tho' about 60 years of age, is <lb/>ſtill
          much troubled with them: the worms, which <lb/>he voids, appear flat, and much larger than
          thoſe, <lb/>which his children have obſerved. Her ſiſter is often <lb/>exceedingly
          diſordered by them. About three months <lb/>ſince they threw her into violent convulſions,
          and for <lb/>ſome time deprived her of her ſenſes. But the mo- <lb/>ther of the boy has
          been affected in a more extraor- <lb/>dinary manner than the reſt. About 20 years ago
          <lb/>ſhe voided ſome worms, which forced their way <lb/>thro' the pores of the ſkin, as it
          is ſuppoſed; for <lb/>they were found in ſmall cluſters under her arms. <lb/>As ſhe was
          very young then, ſhe does not remember <lb/>how ſhe was particularly affected; only, that
          ſhe <lb/>ſuffered violent ſtruggles and convulſions. She is <lb/>ſtill, about five or ſix
          times in a year, ſeized with <lb/>fainting fits, which uſually attack her in bed, and
          <lb/>laſt three or four minutes; but ſhe cannot certainly <lb/>ſay, tho' there is very
          little reaſon to doubt, that <lb/>they are occaſioned by worms. </p>

          <lb/>child; but about that age was afflicted with ſtoppages, <lb/>which often threw him
          into convulſive fits, and at <lb/>laſt rendered him quite an idiot. He continued in
          <lb/>this condition for about four years, eating and drink- <lb/>ing all that time any
          thing that came in his way, <lb/>even his own excrements, if not narrowly watched.
          <lb/>His father took the advice of ſeveral eminent phyſi- <lb/>cians, both at Norwich and

        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>About the beginning of Auguſt laſt he happened <lb/>to get at a painting-pot, wherein
          there was about a <lb/>pound of white lead and lamp-black mixed up with <lb/>linſeed oil.
          This he eat almoſt all up before he was <lb/>diſcovered. It vomited and purged him, and
          brought <lb/>away prodigious numbers of ſmall worms. In a <lb/>few days he grew well, his
          ſenſes returned, and he <lb/>is now able to give as rational anſwers as can be ex-
