        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">O</hi>N the 7th Inſtant, I was called hence to <hi rend="italic">Bal-
          <lb/>leruc</hi>, to viſit an <hi rend="italic">Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, who was <lb/>ill
        there. In the Houſe where he lodg'd, was one <lb/><hi rend="italic">P—r M—n</hi>, born in
          <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, but ſettled in <hi rend="italic">Ca- <lb/>diz</hi>. This
        poor Gentleman, having been very ill theſe <lb/>two or three Years laſt paſt, had loſt the
        Uſe of his <lb/>Left Leg and Thigh, was ſubject to frequent Head-achs <lb/>and Pains in his
        Bones, but more eſpecially in his <lb/>Legs: For which, becauſe he had been given to Wo-
        <lb/>men, his Phyſicians in <hi rend="italic">Cadiz</hi> ſalivated him twice, <lb/>ſent him
        to ſeveral hot Waters, and gave him all the <lb/>Remedies they could imagine, but to no
        Purpoſe; for <lb/>his Illneſs increaſing, he had from time to time great <lb/>Difficulty of
        making Water, and going to Stool. In <lb/>this Condition he came from <hi rend="italic"
          >Spain</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Marſeilles</hi>, and <lb/>from thence was ſent to the
        Waters of <hi rend="italic">Balleruc</hi>, of <lb/>which he drank a great Quantity. But as
        they did not <lb/>paſs, his Phyſician there order'd him ſtrong Purges, <lb/>with Clyſters of
        a Decoction of <hi rend="italic">Tobacco</hi>, and the like. <lb/>He then began to vomit his
        Excrements; upon which <lb/>the Phyſician to the Marquis of <hi rend="italic">C—</hi>'s
        Regiment <lb/>in <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi>, who happen'd to be there, order'd him half
          <pb n="140"/>
        <lb/>a Pound of crude <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> by the Mouth, which made <lb/>him
        ſuffer the moſt exquiſite Pains; and his Belly <lb/>ſwell'd, and became as ſtiff as a Drum.
        Here Dr. <lb/><hi rend="italic">Montagne</hi> was ſent for, who ſoon diſcover'd the Er-
        <lb/>ror in the preceding Practice, by feeling a ſolid Body <lb/>near the <hi rend="italic"
          >Rectum</hi>, which obſtructing the Paſſage, hin- <lb/>der'd the Clyſter-pipe from
        entering far enough into <lb/>the Gut. After his Departure, the Patient was again
        <lb/>order'd Clyſters, which were injected with a crooked <lb/>Pipe, and ſeveral Purges;
        till at the End of eight Days <lb/>he died, having his Belly bigger, ſtiffer and harder
        <lb/>than ever. Though I arriv'd the Day before his Death, <lb/>I ſaw him not till after he
        expir'd. His Phyſician <lb/>having invited me to open the Body, I willingly con-
        <lb/>ſented, curious as I was to find the ſolid Reſiſtance or <lb/>Tumor, which he could
        give no Account of. I ſent <lb/>for the Surgeon of the Village, who with a <hi rend="italic"
          >Biſtouri</hi>
        <lb/>(the only anatomical Inſtrument he had) open'd the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Abdomen</hi>
        by my Directions, which was fill'd with a <lb/>whitiſh Liquor of ſome Conſiſtence. The <hi
          rend="italic">Epiploon</hi>
        <lb/>was all diſſolv'd, and ſwam in this Liquor like ſo much <lb/><hi rend="italic"
        >Pus</hi>. This Water pour'd out, I examin'd the Inteſ- <lb/>tines. The <hi rend="italic"
          >Colon</hi> was burſt under the Stomach, and <lb/>in three other Places at its lower Part;
        and ſo was the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Coecum</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Ileum</hi> all
        inflam'd, and in one Part gan- <lb/>gren'd. The Lips of the Ruptures were plaiſter'd
        <lb/>with Excrements, all beſet with a prodigious Number <lb/>of Globules of Quickſilver;
        and when the Inteſtines <lb/>were diſengaged and taken out, the Quickſilver fell <lb/>from
        them in large Drops. The other <hi rend="italic">Viſcera</hi> were <lb/>in the natural
        State, except the Liver, which was gan- <lb/>gren'd. As I was very ſolicitous about the
        Tumor, I <lb/>look'd into the <hi rend="italic">Pelvis</hi>, where I found an Excreſcence
          <pb n="141"/>
        <lb/>of a prodigious Size, which fill'd all its Left Side. I took <lb/>the Knife, and
        clear'd all round the Tumor; whereby <lb/>I found the urinary Bladder cloſe pent up between
        the <lb/>anterior Part of the Tumor and the <hi rend="italic">Oſſa pubis</hi>, which
        <lb/>occasion'd the Strangury the Patient had been tor- <lb/>mented with: The <hi
          rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, which lay upon the Mid- <lb/>dle of the <hi rend="italic">Os
          ſacrum</hi>, was alſo vaſtly preſs'd on by <lb/>the Tumor, which ſeem'd to take its Riſe
        from the <lb/>Holes that are in the Left Side of that Bone. The <lb/>Surgeon was ſo
        unluckily impatient, that while I laid <lb/>down the Knife, in order to ſeparate the <hi
          rend="italic">Oſſa pubis</hi>
        <lb/>with a Hatchet, he cut out the Tumor. I then exa- <lb/>min'd the <hi rend="italic">Os
          ſacrum</hi>, which was ſo very ſoft, that my <lb/>Fingers enter'd it every where on the
        Left Side. The <lb/>Tumor is of an ovoïde Figure, cover'd over with ſe- <lb/>veral
        Membranes: Its Weight is two Pound and an <lb/>half; its longeſt Axis is five Inches and
        ſomewhat more <lb/>than three quarters, <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Meaſure; its ſhorteſt
        four <lb/>Inches three quarters. At firſt Sight I took it for a <hi rend="italic">Pa-
          <lb/>renchyma</hi>, but, upon Diſſection, found it analogous to <lb/>the Liver in
        Subſtance, Colour and Conſiſtence. Its <lb/>Artery, Vein and Nerve are very big, and are
        diſtri- <lb/>buted through its whole Subſtance: Wherefore I <lb/>really take it to be one of
        the conglobate Glands of <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Pelvis</hi>, whoſe Veſſels yielding to
        the Blood im- <lb/>pell'd thither with greater Force and in larger Quan- <lb/>tity than
        uſual, on account of the violent Exerciſes of <lb/>Dancing, Jumping, <hi rend="italic"
          >&amp;c.</hi> which the Patient very much <lb/>practis'd, gave Room to its Increaſe to
        that enormous <lb/>Size. Upon opening, I remark'd three very apparent <lb/>Diviſions in it:
        And where the <hi rend="italic">Pſoas</hi> lay over it, and <lb/>one of the <hi
          rend="italic">Pyramidales</hi> beat upon it, it was oſſified. <lb/>I preſerve it in
        Brandy, and find that the ſmall Veſſels, <pb n="142"/>
        <lb/>that were moſt fill'd with Blood, preſs it out into the <lb/>Interſtices of the
        neighbouring ones. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The Weight the Patient conſtantly complain'd of <lb/>at his Left Hip; the Difficulty he
        had in going to Stool, <lb/>and that of thruſting a Syringe far enough into the <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Rectum</hi> to give him a Clyſter with any Succeſs; the <lb/>Tumor itſelf,
        which was eaſily felt upon putting the <lb/>Finger into the <hi rend="italic">Anus</hi>;
        together with the Palſy of the <lb/>Left Leg and Thigh, might, I think, have given other
        <lb/>Indications to the Phyſicians, than thoſe they took. <lb/>And, in my humble Opinion,
        the Frictions and other <lb/>heating Medicines the Patient was ply'd with, contri-
        <lb/>buted to augment his Illneſs. In fine, the crude <hi rend="italic">Mer- <lb/>cury</hi>
        he ſwallow'd, the vaſt Quantity of <hi rend="italic">Balleruc</hi> Wa- <lb/>ter he drank
        before it, with the ſtrong Cathartics taken <lb/>by the Mouth and <hi rend="italic"
          >Anus</hi>, ſeem to have cut him ſhort <lb/>of ſome Months, which he might have liv'd, had
        he <lb/>uſed no other Remedies than a ſlender relaxing Diet. </p>
