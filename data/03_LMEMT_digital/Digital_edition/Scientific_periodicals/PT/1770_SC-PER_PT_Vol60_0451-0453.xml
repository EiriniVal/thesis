        </note><hi rend="dc(2)">M</hi>R. A. B. about 55 years of age, was <lb/>an healthy man till
        about 20 years <lb/>ſince, when he was ſirst ſeized with a fever; at which <lb/>time he
        followed the trade of a miller, and maker of <lb/>French barley. This laſt buſineſs, he
        tells me, is at- <lb/>tended with very great heat to the operator, and ex- <lb/>poſes him to
        a continual cloud of duſt. As soon as he <lb/>began to work, his breath grew oppreſſed with
        a ſen- <lb/>ſation of his body being puffed up all over; from which <lb/>ſymtoms he was
        relieved by occaſionally leaving off <lb/>his buſineſs. On the firſt cold caught after his
        en- <lb/>tering on this kind of employment, a fever attacked <lb/>him; which has generally
        returned ſometimes once, <lb/>and ſometimes twice in a year, chiefly in autumn; <lb/>but
        ſometimes in ſpring likewiſe: though he once <lb/>miſſed being ill for two years together.
        After carry- <lb/>ing on this trade for four or five years, he left if off; <lb/>as he
        attributed his diſorder chiefly to the effects of <lb/>the meal duſt. Be that as it will,
        the fevers have <lb/>not been ſo violent ſince, as while he followed that <lb/>occupation:
        though the cuticle, or outer ſkin, has <lb/>come off, the ſame as before. As to the
        particulars <lb/>of his illneſs, they are nearly as follow: The diſorder <pb n="452"/>
        <lb/>begins with a violent fever, attended with pains in <lb/>the head, back, and limbs,
        accompanied with conti- <lb/>nual retchings; he ſometimes vomited up much bile, at
        <lb/>other times little or none; the ſkin was dry, the tongue <lb/>much furred, together
        with great thirſt, coſtiveneſs, <lb/>and the urine highly coloured. At the beginning of
        <lb/>the fever he was generally let blood; this evacua- <lb/>tion afforded ſome relief, and
        by keeping his body open, <lb/>and taking cooling medicines, the retchings abated <lb/>in
        about five or ſix days: the whole ſurface of the <lb/>body became yellow, though this
        circumſtance did <lb/>not always happen. Afterwards it became florid, <lb/>having the
        appearance of a raſh; on which he felt <lb/>a great uneaſineſs for ſeveral days, with a
        numbneſs <lb/>and tingling all over him: when the urine grew <lb/>turned, and depoſited a
        thick ſediment. About the <lb/>beginning of the third week from the first attack, <lb/>the
        cuticle appeared elevated in many places. In <lb/>eight or nine days afterwards it became ſo
        looſe, as <lb/>to admit of being eaſily removed in large flakes. <lb/>The cuticle of the
        hands from the wriſt to the <lb/>fingers ends came off whole, bearing the reſemblance
        <lb/>of a glove. He never was diſpoſed to ſweat in any <lb/>part of his illneſs, and when
        ſweating was attempted <lb/>by medicines, he grew worſe for it; nor was he <lb/>much at eaſe
        till his urine depoſited a ſediment, <lb/>after which he felt very little inconvenience, but
        <lb/>from the rigidity of the ſkin. The nails of the <lb/>patient, whoſe caſe you
        communicated to the Royal <lb/>Society, are mentioned to have come off after the
        <lb/>illneſs; I did not find that ever was the caſe in this <lb/>perſon. </p>
      <pb n="453"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As to your communicating the above account to <lb/>the Royal Society, I beg that may be
        as you think pro- <lb/>per: though, I ſhould ſuppoſe it would not prove <lb/>unacceptable to
        the medical members of that learned <lb/>body; as it may ſhew, that the caſe already
        recorded <lb/>in the Philoſophical Tranſactions of laſt year is not <lb/>a ſingular one. I
        wiſh the glove, I ſend you, was <lb/>as perfect as I have ſeen ſome of them; but, as it is,
        <lb/>I beg your acceptance of it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>With the human glove, you will recieve a curioſity, <lb/>which I think not inferior to
        the glove; to wit, a <lb/>very ſmall fœtus, brough into the world at the ſame <lb/>time with
        a live child at its full growth. The wo- <lb/>man was delivered before I came to her: on ex-
        <lb/>amining the placenta, a ſubſtance appeared ſome- <lb/>what unuſual; and on waſhing it
        clean, I diſcovered <lb/>the fœtus abovementioned. It had no viſible com- <lb/>munication
        with the placenta, but was ſqueezed flat, <lb/>though not in the leaſt putrid, and ſeemed
        ſhrivelled. <lb/>I don't remember a caſe like this mentioned, except <lb/>in Smellie's, vol.
        ii. p. 85, where he relates one from <lb/>the Academy of Sciences at Paris, nearly ſimilar
        to <lb/>this. May we not ſuppoſe the woman to have been <lb/>with a child of twins; and that
        this, dying, was not <lb/>diſcharged, as was moſt likely to happen, but re- <lb/>mained till
        the time of the natural birth, when they <lb/>were both expelled together? </p>
