        </note><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi>Mong the many uſeful diſcoveries, <lb/>which this age hath
        made, there <lb/>are very few which, better deſerve the attention of the <lb/>public than
        what I am going to lay before your <lb/>Lordſhip. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>There is a bark of an Engliſh tree, which I have <lb/>found by experience to be a
        powerful aſtringent, and <lb/>very efficacious in curing aguiſh and intermitting
        <lb/>diſorders. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>About ſix years ago, I accidentally taſted it, and was <lb/>ſurpriſed at its
        extraordinary bitterneſs; which im- <lb/>mediately raiſed me a ſuſpicion of its having the
        <lb/>properties of the Peruvian bark. As this tree delights <lb/>in a moiſt or wet ſoil,
        where agues chiefly abound, <lb/>the general maxim, that many natural maladies car- <lb/>ry
        their cures along with them, or that their remedies <lb/>lie not far from their cauſes, was
        ſo very appoſite to <lb/>this particular caſe, that I could not help applying it; <lb/>and
        that this might be the intention of Providence here, <lb/>I muſt own had ſome little weight
        with me. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The exceſſive plenty of this bark furniſhed <lb/>me, in my ſpeculative diſquiſitions
        upon it, with an <pb n="196"/>
        <lb/>argument both for and againſt theſe imaginary qua- <lb/>lities of it; for, on one hand,
        as intermittents are <lb/>very common, it was reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that what <lb/>was
        deſigned for their cure, ſhould be as common and <lb/>as eaſy to be procured. But then, on
        the other hand, <lb/>it ſeemed probable, that, if there was any conſiderable <lb/>virtue in
        this bark, it muſt have been diſcovered from <lb/>its plenty. My curioſity prompted me to
        look into <lb/><choice>
          <corr/>
          <sic>into </sic>
        </choice>the diſpenſatories and books of botany, and ex- <lb/>amine what they ſaid
        concerning it; but there it ex- <lb/>iſted only by name. I could not find, that it hath, or
        <lb/>ever had, any place in pharmacy, or any ſuch qualities, <lb/>as I ſuſpected aſcribed to
        it by the botaniſts. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>However, I determined to make ſome experiments <lb/>with it; and, for this purpoſe, I
        gathered that ſummer <lb/>near a pound weight of it, which I dryed in a bag, <lb/>upon the
        outſide of a baker's oven, for more than three <lb/>months, at which time it was to be
        reduced to a <lb/>powder, by pounding and ſifting after the manner <lb/>that other barks are
        pulverized. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It was not long before I had an opportunity of <lb/>making a trial of it; but, being an
        entire ſtranger to its <lb/>nature, I gave it in very ſmall quantities, I think it <lb/>was
        about twenty grains of the powder at a doſe, and <lb/>repeated it every four hours between
        the fits; but with <lb/>great caution and the ſtricteſt attention to its effects: <lb/>the
        fits were conſiderably abated, but did not entirely <lb/>ceaſe. Not perceiving the leaſt ill
        conſequences, I grew <lb/>bolder with it, and in a few days encreaſed the doſe <lb/>to two
        ſcruples, and the ague was ſoon removed. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It was then given to ſeveral others with the ſame <lb/>ſucceſs; but I found it better
        anſwered the intention, <lb/>when a dram of it was taken every four hours in the
        <lb/>intervals of the paroxiſms. </p>
      <pb n="197"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I have continued to uſe it as a remedy for agues <lb/>and intermitting diſorders for
        five years ſucceſſively <lb/>and ſucceſsfully. It hath been given I believe to fifty
        <lb/>perſons, and never failed in the cure, except in a few <lb/><choice>
          <corr>autumnal</corr>
          <sic>autumual</sic>
        </choice> and quartan agues, with which the patients <lb/>had been long and ſeverely
        afflicted; theſe it reduced <lb/>in a great degree, but did not wholly take them off;
        <lb/>the patient, at the uſual time for the return of his fit, <lb/>felt ſome ſmattering of
        his diſtemper, which the in- <lb/>ceſſant repetition of theſe powders could not conquer:
        <lb/>it ſeemed as if their power could reach thus far <lb/>and no farther, and I did ſuppoſe
        that it would not <lb/>have long continued to reach ſo far, and that the diſ- <lb/>temper
        would have ſoon returned with its priſtine <lb/>violence; but I did not ſtay to ſee the
        iſſue: I added <lb/>one fifth part of the Peruvian bark to it, and with <lb/>this ſmall
        auxiliary it totally routed its adverſary. <lb/>It was found neceſſary likewiſe, in one or
        two obſti- <lb/>nate caſes, at other times of the year, to mix the ſame <lb/>quantity of
        that bark with it; but theſe were caſes <lb/>where the patient went abroad imprudently, and
        <lb/>caught cold, as a poſt-chaiſe boy did, who, being <lb/>almoſt recovered from an
        inveterate tertian ague, <lb/>would follow his buſineſs, by which means he not <lb/>only
        neglected his powders, but, meeting with bad <lb/>weather, renewed his diſtemper. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>One fifth part was the largeſt and indeed the only <lb/>proportion of the quinquina
        made uſe of in this <lb/>compoſition, and this only upon extraordinary occa- <lb/>ſions: the
        patient was never prepared, either by vo- <lb/>miting, bleeding, purging, or any medicines
        of a <lb/>ſimilar intention, for the reception of this bark, but <lb/>he entered upon it
        abruptly and immediately, and it <choice>

          </corr>

            <pb n="188"/>
          </sic>
        </choice>
        <lb/>was always given in powders, with any common ve- <lb/>hicle, as water, tea, ſmall beer
        and ſuch like. This <lb/>was done purely to aſcertain its effects; and that I <lb/>might be
        aſſured the changes wrought in the patient <lb/>could not be attributed to any other thing:
        though, <lb/>had there been a due preparation, the moſt obſtinate <lb/>intermittents would
        probably have yielded to this bark <lb/>without any foreign aſſiſtance: And, by all I can
        <lb/>judge from five years experience of it upon a number <lb/>of perſons, it appears to be
        a powerful abſorbent, <lb/>aſtringent, and febrifuge in intermitting caſes, of the <lb/>ſame
        nature and kind with the Peruvian bark, and to <lb/>have all its properties, though perhaps
        not always in <lb/><choice>
          <corr/>
          <sic>in </sic>
        </choice>the ſame degree. It ſeems likewiſe to have this ad- <lb/>ditional quality, viz. to
        be a ſafe medicine; for I never <lb/>could perceive the leaſt ill effect from it, though it
        <lb/>had been always given without any preparation of <lb/>the patient. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The tree, from which this bark is taken, is ſtiled <lb/>by Ray, in his Synopſis, Salix,
        alba, vulgaris, the <lb/>common white Willow. Hæc omnium nobis cognita- <lb/>rum maxima eſt,
        et in ſatis craſſam et proceram Ar- <lb/>borem adoleſcit. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It is called in theſe parts, by the common people, <lb/>the willow, and ſometimes the
        Dutch willow; but, <lb/>if it be of a foreign extraction, it hath been ſo long
        <lb/>naturalized to this climate, that it thrives as well <lb/>in it as if it was in its
        original ſoil. It is easily diſtin- <lb/>guiſhed by the notable bitterneſs and the free
        running <lb/>of its bark, which may be readily ſeparated from it <lb/>all the ſummer months
        whilſt the ſap is up. I took <lb/>it from the ſhoots of three or four years growth, that
        <lb/>ſprung from Pollard trees, the diameters of which <choice>
          <corr>
            <pb n="199"/>
          </corr>

            <pb n="189"/>
          </sic>
        </choice>
        <lb/>ſhoots, at their biggeſt end, were from one to four or <lb/>five inches: it is
        poſſible, and indeed not improbable, <lb/>that this cortex, taken from larger or older
        ſhoots, or <lb/>from the trunk of the tree itſelf, may be ſtronger; <lb/>but I have not had
        time nor opportunities to make <lb/>the experiments, which ought to be made upon it.
        <lb/>The bark, I had, was gathered in the northern parts <lb/>of Oxfordſhire, which are
        chiefly of dry and gravelly <lb/>nature, affording few moiſt of moory places for this
        <lb/>tree to grow in; and therefore, I ſuſpect that its bark <lb/>is not ſo good here as in
        ſome other parts of the king- <lb/>dom. Few vegetables are equal in every place; all
        <lb/>have their peculiar ſoils, where they arrive to a greater <lb/>perfection than in any
        other place: the beſt and <lb/>ſtrongeſt Muſtard-ſeed is gathered in the county of
        <lb/>Durham; the fineſt Saffron-Flowers are produced <lb/>in ſome particular ſpots of Eſſex
        and Cambridgeſhire; <lb/>the beſt Cyder-apples grow in Herefordſhire, De- <lb/>vonſhire and
        the adjacent counties; the roots of <lb/>Valerian are eſteemed moſt medicinal, which are
        <lb/>dug up in Oxfordſhire and Gloceſterſhire: And there- <lb/>fore why may not the Cortex
        Salignus, or Cortex <lb/>Anglicanus, have its favourite ſoil, where it may flo- <lb/>riſh
        moſt, and attain to its higheſt perfection? It is very <lb/>probable that it hath; and
        perhaps it may be in the <lb/>fens of Lincolnſhire, Cambridgeſhire, Eſſex, Kent, or
        <lb/>ſome ſuch like ſituations; and, though the bark, which <lb/>grew in the county of
        Oxford, may ſeem in ſome <lb/>particular caſes to be a little inferior to the quinquina,
        <lb/>yet, in other places, it may equal, if not exceed it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The powders made from this bark are at firſt of a <lb/>light brown, tinged with a duſky
        yellow, and the <lb/>longer they are kept, the more they incline to a <pb n="200"/>
        <lb/>cinnamon or lateritious colour, which I believe is the <lb/>caſe with the Peruvian bark
        and powders. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I have no other motives for publiſhing this valua- <lb/>ble ſpecific, than that it may
        have a fair and full trial <lb/>in all its variety of circumſtances and ſituations, and
        <lb/>that the world may reap the benefits accruing from <lb/>it. For theſe purpoſes I have
        given this long and <lb/>minute account of it, and which I would not have <lb/>troubled your
        Lordſhip with, was I not fully perſuaded <lb/>of the wonderful efficacy of this Cortex
        Salignus <lb/>in agues and intermitting caſes, and did I not think, <lb/>that this
