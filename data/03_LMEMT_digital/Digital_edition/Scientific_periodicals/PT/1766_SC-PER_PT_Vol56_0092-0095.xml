        </note><hi rend="dc(2)">M</hi>RS Morton, aged 26, of a ſpare <lb/>habit and a ſmall ſize, in
        the ſum- <lb/>mer of the year 1750, frequently complained of a <lb/>pain in her right ſide.
        About the middle of July, the <lb/>ſame year, a violent vomiting and pain in her ſtomach
        <lb/>introduced an acute fever, accompanied with a con- <lb/>ſtant deep-ſeated pain in the
        right ſide, under the <lb/>coſtæ nothæ, a little lower than where the uſual pleu- <lb/>ritic
        ſymptom in either ſide is generally felt. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Copious bleedings, to ſixty ounces and upwards, <lb/>with a veſicatory on the affected
        part, and pectoral me- <lb/>dicines internally, afforded ſome temporal relief. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>July 27th, Upon the account of an intolerable pain, <lb/>at her ſtomach, a very
        uncommon uneaſineſs, and <lb/>gripings in her belly, a medicine was exhibited, com-
        <lb/>poſed of pulv. ſtann. corralin. &amp;c. and the day follow- <lb/>ing, ſhe voided by
        ſtool a large annular worm, <lb/>about half an inch broad, in length ſix yards and a
        <lb/>half. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Auguſt 1ſt, This day, upon examination, was <lb/>diſcovered a conſiderable tumor,
        ſuſpected, from its <lb/>ſituation, and previous ſymptoms, to be formed in the <lb/>anterior
        part of the liver, of an oblong figure, and <pb n="93"/>
        <lb/>extended its longeſt diameter acroſs the epigaſtrium <lb/>about ſeven inches. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The patient, by this time, greatly debilitated by <lb/>the large evacuations and fever,
        which ſtill exiſted, <lb/>became ſo low and diſpirited, that ſhe had given over all
        <lb/>thoughts of <choice>
          <corr>recovery</corr>
          <sic>recovey</sic>
        </choice>, her huſband and relations being of <lb/>the ſame opinion. To Dr. J. Dundas, an
        eminent <lb/>phyſician, who had occaſionally attended, I propoſed <lb/>making an inciſion
        into the tumor; though the event, <lb/><choice>
          <corr>under</corr>
          <sic>uuder</sic>
        </choice> the preſent circumſtances, had but an indifferent <lb/>aſpect. This propoſal was,
        however, approved of by <lb/>the doctor, our patient, and her relations, under the
        <lb/>following terms, viz. to have the opinion of the <lb/>principal ſurgeon or ſurgeons in
        that city on the <lb/>expediency of the operation, in order that, ſhould the <lb/>experiment
        prove unſucceſsful, there might be no <lb/>blame imputed afterwards. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Strong ſuppuratives, in the form of cataplaſms, were <lb/>now uſed, whereby the tumor
        became more promi- <lb/>nent in two days; a very deep fluctuation being felt, <lb/>a large
        cauſtic was applied on the moſt depending <lb/>poſterior ſide, thereby to avoid hurting the
        ſtomach <lb/>or its appendages by an inciſion, which was made <lb/>ſeveral hours after, from
        whence iſſued a copious <lb/>diſcharge, at firſt purulent, at laſt glutinous, reſembling
        <lb/>the white of an egg: no adheſion to the peritoneum <lb/>could be felt, though
        accurately tryed all round with <lb/>the finger. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Great attention and care were uſed in the proper <lb/>applications, bandage, &amp;c.
        particularly in the poſture <lb/>of the patient; ivory and ſilver flat cannulas, kept in
        <lb/>the aperture, were materially beneficial, as well for <lb/>the conveyance of balſamic
        injections, as to facilitate <pb n="94"/>
        <lb/>the exit of the putrid contents. The 3d night after <lb/>the operation, ſhe turned
        delirious; this ſymptom, <lb/>with an increaſed fever and exceſſive cough, afforded
        <lb/>little or no hopes of a recovery, the more eſpecially, <lb/>as the diſcharge was now
        turned exceſſively thin, of a <lb/>duſky colour and very fœtid: for theſe reaſons, I
        <lb/>dreſſed her twice a day, throwing in large quantities <lb/>of a warm injection,
        compoſed of a decoct. ficuum, and <lb/>rad. alth. wherein was diſſolved balſ. capiv. to
        which <lb/>was added, when the fever abated, ſome calomel ppt. <lb/>In the mean time
        medicines internally, to allay her <lb/>fever and cough, were not neglected; and ſhe after-
        <lb/>wards took daily, as her ſtomach and other ſymptoms <lb/>would admit, a light infuſion
        of cort. peruv. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>By theſe means ſtrictly followed, about the 21ſt <lb/>day from that of the inciſion, a
        laudable pus was <lb/>obtained; but on the 23d, a thin ſanious diſcharge in <lb/>great
        quantities burſt out, worſe than the former, and <lb/>extremely fœtid. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Towards the end of the month, it began once more <lb/>to aſſume a benign aſpect, but
        broke out a 3d and 4th <lb/>time, on the 1ſt and 15th of September, every time <lb/>the
        diſcharge growing more and more acrid, ſo as to <lb/>excoriate and inflame the external
        parts; notwith- <lb/>ſtanding theſe threatnings, by a cloſe perſeverance in <lb/>the
        forementioned method, at the end of ten weeks, <lb/>a callous cicatrix was obtained upon the
        external <lb/>wound, and the recovery compleated ſoon after by <lb/>the uſe of a few
        alterative mercurial pills. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The woman is ſtill alive, now (1766) in London, <lb/>and enjoys a middling ſtate of
        health; only has been <lb/>liable to complaints of gripes and indigeſtion, every <pb n="95"/>
