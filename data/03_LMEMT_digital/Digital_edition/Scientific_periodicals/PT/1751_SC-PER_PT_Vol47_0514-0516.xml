        pleaſe to know, <lb/>that, on January 3, 1752, there was an accident of <lb/>the plague,
        when the thermometer was at 53. Jan. <lb/>24, another accident, therm. 52. Jan. 26, an acci-
        <lb/>dent at Buiukdere, therm. 51. Feb. 8, accidents at <lb/>Caſſim, Pacha, and Phanar,
        therm. 52. Feb. 10, <lb/>an accident in Galata, therm. 55; patient recover'd. <lb/>Feb. 15,
        another accident in the ſame houſe, therm. <lb/>53. March 8, an accident in Galata, therm.
        56; <lb/>and not one accident ſince, tho' at preſent the ther- <lb/>mometer is at 50, and
        has been at 44 the 16 inſtant; <lb/>ſo that we have great hopes to get clear, if no in-
        <lb/>fection is convey'd to us from any other quarter. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>To ſatisfy you, how I came to be ſo exact in dates, <lb/>it is proper to inform you,
        that I have kept, ever <lb/>ſince I have been in Turkey, a journal of the ther-
        <lb/>mometer, barometer, winds, weather, diſeaſes, and <lb/>other events; which I mark down
        exactly twice <lb/>every 24 hours. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Proſper Alpinus obſerves, that the Eteſian winds <lb/>at Cairo remove the plague
        intirely; ſo that they <lb/>fear nothing after theſe winds begin. And I can <lb/>aſſure, <hi
          rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, that all the plagues, which have been <lb/>at Smyrna and
        Conſtantinople for the laſt twenty <pb n="515"/>
        <lb/>years, have been hotteſt and moſt violent during <lb/>the ſeaſon of the Eteſian winds;
        ſtill allowing, that, <lb/>were it not for the Eteſian winds, the plague would <lb/>be more
        violent in the hot months. Witneſs the 24 <lb/>of June 1735, there being no wind, the
        ſickneſs ra- <lb/>vaged more than any other day, while it laſted. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I return you many thanks for ſhewing my remarks <lb/>to the Royal Society. I am
        ſenſible they have no <lb/>other merit imaginable, beſides their being true, <lb/>which may
        be a motive for ſome of the beſt taſte <lb/>to reliſh them. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As I hear there is a bill to be brought into parlia- <lb/>ment to regulate quarantines,
        I will give my humble <lb/>opinion of them, as they ought to be obſerved in
        <lb/>Great-Britain and Ireland. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>1. It ſeems to me uſeleſs to put a ſhip's company <lb/>from the Levant in quarantine in
        Britain. For how <lb/>is it poſſible, that men, who have been one or two <lb/>months at ſea,
        toſs'd about with different winds and <lb/>weathers, and arriving, after ſuch a time, in
        good <lb/>health in England, can have any infection in their <lb/>bare bodies? Wherefore, as
        ſoon as they arrive, they <lb/>ſhould be ſtripp'd naked, and have clean linen and
        <lb/>cloaths put on, and then ſent immediately aſhore. <lb/>This would ſave to the owners of
        ſhips theſe ſailors <lb/>wages and victuals during the quarantine; and the <lb/>ſailors
        might go to ſea again, without eating the <lb/>bread of idleneſs for ſo many days. The caſe
        is <lb/>different in Italy, and in the ſouth of France; to <lb/>which countries a ſhip with
        a fair wind may per- <lb/>form a voyage in eight days from the Levant; during <lb/>which
        time a perſon may have the plague about <pb n="516"/>
        <lb/>him, without being confin'd to his bed; of which <lb/>there are many inſtances. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>2. There ſhould be found very honeſt men to be <lb/>overſeers of the lazaretto, who
        will take the trouble <lb/>of ſeeing all the goods unbaled, and every particular <lb/>parcel
        expoſed to the air: Otherwiſe, if the goods re- <lb/>main in the ſame place, and every ſhred
        not expoſed <lb/>to the air, they may be as well in the merchants ma- <lb/>gazines as in the
        lazaretto. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>3. No perſon, during quarantine, ſhould be al- <lb/>low'd to go near the lazaretto,
        excepting ſuch as have <lb/>the care of it; for fear ſtrangers, going too near, <lb/>may
        receive infection from the goods in the lazaretto, <lb/>and, at their return, communicate it
        to others. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>4. There ſhould be one or more doctors to attend <lb/>the lazaretto, and take care of
        the people, who look <lb/>after it, in caſe any of them ſhould be ſick, that <lb/>their
        ſickneſs may immediately be known: And, <lb/>ſhould it prove contagious, the patient ſhould
        be ſe- <lb/>parated, and ſo the infection, as much as poſſible, <lb/>hindred from ſpreading. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>5. The ſhips ſhould be very well clean'd and per- <lb/>fum'd in the hold, and between
        decks, where the <lb/>goods lay during the voyage, for ſome days after <lb/>they are
        unloaden. Otherwiſe perſons going into the <lb/>hold of the ſaid ſhips, may be infected, and
        com- <lb/>municate the infection to others. This I communi- <lb/>cate to you, as you have an
        opportunity of converſing <lb/>with ſeveral members of parliament. </p>
