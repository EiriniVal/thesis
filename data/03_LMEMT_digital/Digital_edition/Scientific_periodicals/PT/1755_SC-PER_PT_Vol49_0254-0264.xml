        manner of the <lb/>formation of the embryo, and the changes it under- <lb/>goes, while it
        continues extremely ſmall, concerning <lb/>all which we ſhall ever remain very much in the
        <lb/>dark; there are not a few things relating even to <lb/>the mature fœtus, which create
        matter of diſpute <lb/>amongſt anatomiſts and phyſiologiſts. Of theſe the <lb/>manner of its
        nouriſhment <hi rend="italic">in utero</hi> is not the leaſt <lb/>important. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The preſent ſtate of the controverſy concerning <lb/>this matter turns on the following
        preciſe point, to <lb/>wit, whether the fœtus in utero be nouriſhed ſolely <lb/>by the
        blood, which is tranſmitted to it through the <pb n="255"/>
        <lb/>umbilical cord; or whether it is likewiſe nouriſhed <lb/>in part by the liquor amnii,
        in which it ſwims. I <lb/>have ſaid the preſent ſtate of the controverſy; for I <lb/>believe
        very few, if any at all, will maintain now-a- <lb/>days with Claudius de la Courvée and
        Stalpart Van- <lb/>der-wiel, that the whole of its nouriſhment is con- <lb/>veyed by the
        mouth, and none at all by blood- <lb/>veſſels. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Both ſides of the queſtion have been eſpouſed by <lb/>able writers, and ſupported with
        great acuteneſs, eru- <lb/>dition and induſtry. And as there ſtill ſubſiſts a <lb/>diviſion
        amongſt candid and intelligent inquirers <lb/>concerning this matter, it would appear, that
        ſome <lb/>deciſive fact, ſome demonſtrative argument hath hi- <lb/>therto eſcaped notice,
        which, if clearly known and <lb/>duly attended to, would have by this time ended <lb/>the
        diſpute, and rendered the propoſition, which de- <lb/>clares the truth, on which-ſoever of
        the ſides, an <lb/>object of ſcience; which before was only matter of <lb/>opinion. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>An obſervation, which fell in my way two years <lb/>ago, together with ſome ſubſequent
        ones, which I <lb/>purpoſely made in purſuance of the hint ſuggeſted by <lb/>the firſt,
        will, I hope, enable all, who candidly con- <lb/>ſider the facts themſelves, and the
        conſequences that <lb/>naturally flow from them, to determine certainly, on <lb/>which ſide
        the truth lies. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Before I relate my obſervations, let me lay down <lb/>a neceſſary preliminary, which I
        obſerve the writers <lb/>on both ſides are either explicitly or implicitly agreed <lb/>in;
        to wit, that if it be clearly made out, that the <lb/>liquor amnii is naturally received
        into the mouth, <lb/>ſtomach, and inteſtines of the fœtus, ſwimming in <pb n="256"/>
        <lb/>it; in that caſe we are to conclude, that the fœtus is <lb/>in ſome part nouriſhed by
        it. The whole tract of <lb/>the alimentary paſſage abounds with abſorbent veſſels <lb/>in
        the fœtus, more than in the adult animal; and eſpe- <lb/>cially the ſmall inteſtines have
        lacteals plentifully <lb/>opening into them. The liquor amnii is concretable <lb/>by heat,
        like the white of an egg; which character- <lb/>iſtic in animal juices is, I believe, denied
        by none <lb/>to be a proof of their alimentary nature. To ſuch <lb/>as will not grant this
        poſtulatum, if any ſuch there <lb/>be, this paper is not addreſſed. <hi rend="italic">Contra
          negantem prin- <lb/>cipia non eſt diſputandum</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>But I proceed to relate the obſervations. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>On the 25th of July 1753, being informed, that <lb/>a calf, come to full maturity was
        juſt then brought <lb/>forth dead in this town (Brigg, in Lincolnſhire), <lb/>which had been
        alive, and appeared ſtrong a very <lb/>ſhort time before its birth. I begged it of the
        owner, <lb/>ſuch inſtances being rare. The ſkin being of value, <lb/>for it was an
        extraordinary large calf, it was ſent to <lb/>my houſe flay'd. I firſt examined the thorax,
        which <lb/>was my chief motive for begging it. All I ſhall <lb/>mention now of what I
        obſerved there, is the expe- <lb/>riment of the lungs of a new-born animal their
        <lb/>ſinking in water. After cutting out the lungs and <lb/>heart, I clipped off a piece of
        the former with ſharp <lb/>ſciſſars, about an ounce weight, or more, and threw <lb/>it into
        a baſon full of water. It quickly ſunk to the <lb/>bottom, and ſettled there. Immediately
        after, I blew <lb/>into the remaining part of the lungs, through the <lb/>trachea; and
        though I could by that means diſtend <lb/>them but very little, becauſe the air flowed out
        readily <lb/>through the cut bronchia, and therefore acted but <pb n="257"/>
        <lb/>faintly on the other parts; yet a piece about the <lb/>ſame bigneſs with the firſt,
        clipped off in the ſame <lb/>manner, and thrown into the ſame baſon, conſtantly <lb/>kept at
        the top. This may ſeem foreign to my pre- <lb/>ſent purpoſe; but I thought proper briefly to
        mention <lb/>it here, not only upon the account of the importance <lb/>of the experiment,
        but likewiſe to ſhew, that I was <lb/>not miſinformed in the account of the calf's being
        <lb/>brought forth dead, and that it had not even re- <lb/>ſpired; much leſs taken any
        nouriſhment after ex- <lb/>cluſion, to influence the appearances, which we are <lb/>now
        going to deſcribe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Having done with the thorax, I opened the ab- <lb/>domen, in order to take a ſlight
        view of it before <lb/>the lumbering carcaſe ſhould be removed. I obſerved <lb/>the thick
        inteſtines, eſpecially the rectum, extremely <lb/>diſtended with an incredible quantity of
        meconium; <lb/>which for ſeveral inches above the anus was formed <lb/>into diſtinct ſcybala
        or balls. It came into my head <lb/>to make an inciſion in the rectum, where it was very
        <lb/>turgid, about two inches from the anus, and to let <lb/>out about twenty-five or thirty
        of theſe ſcybala; <lb/>which I laid upon clean paper to dry, that I might <lb/>examine them
        at my leiſure. About three or four <lb/>days after, when they were dry and brittle, of the
        <lb/>colour and conſiſtence of aloes; I was ſurpriſed to <lb/>find, upon examination, every
        ball ſtuck full of <lb/>tough, thick, white hairs, ſome of which were an <lb/>inch long, or
        more. There ſeemed to be ſome ſcores <lb/>in each, though they, being ſhrunk with drying,
        did <lb/>ſcarce exceed the bulk of an ordinary pea. This un- <lb/>expected appearance ſet me
        a conſidering, whence <lb/>theſe hairs had come; how got they there? And I <pb n="258"/>
        <lb/>could think on no other tolerable ſolution of the dif- <lb/>ficulty than to conclude,
        that they belonged originally <lb/>to the calf's ſkin; and, being looſened by macera-
        <lb/>tion in the liquor amnii, were propelled into the <lb/>ſtomach and inteſtines; till
        they were at length en- <lb/>tangled in the meconium. I was confirmed in the <lb/>belief of
        this by being informed, upon inquiry, that <lb/>the calf's ſkin was white; a circumſtance
        unknown <lb/>to me before, it having been ſent flay'd, as hath been <lb/>already ſaid. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>From this perſuaſion it was natural to infer, that <lb/>if hairs looſened from the ſkin
        of the fœtus, and <lb/>floating in the liquor amnii, can find a way into the
        <lb/>inteſtines, and get entangled in the meconium, it is <lb/>impoſſible but the liquor
        amnii muſt enter and paſs <lb/>through the whole alimentary paſſage along with <lb/>them; as
        a fluid may certainly penetrate where hairs <lb/>cannot: but no good reaſon can be aſſigned,
        or even <lb/>conceived, why hairs ſhould be admitted where the <lb/>fluid is excluded. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The only reaſonable ſcruple, that remained to be <lb/>got over, was, that this being
        but a ſingle inſtance, a <lb/>general concluſion was not to be too haſtily drawn <lb/>from
        it; that it was poſſible there might be ſome <lb/>morbid concretions in the meconium of this
        particu- <lb/>lar calf, reſembling hairs, which concretions in a <lb/>common and natural way
        might be wanting; or <lb/>ſome preternatural communication between the primæ <lb/>viæ in
        this ſubject, and the liquor amnii, not to be <lb/>found in the generality of other fœtus's. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>To obviate all this, and farther to eſtabliſh and <lb/>illuſtrate the truth of my
        concluſion, as inſtances like <lb/>that, which we have now related, cannot be com- <pb
          n="259"/>
        <lb/>manded, I laid myſelf out to procure the firſt dung <lb/>of calves after they are
        brought forth; which always <lb/>can be nothing but meconium. This was attended <lb/>with
        ſome difficulty and delay, as cows in this neigh- <lb/>bourhood moſtly calve in the fields.
        After ſome <lb/>months, by the good offices of a ſenſible acquaint- <lb/>ance in this place,
        I obtained what I wanted. He <lb/>was ſo obliging as to watch his own cow's calving,
        <lb/>and before he ſtirred from her, to catch the calf's <lb/>firſt dung, and ſend it me
        forthwith. Some weeks <lb/>after another parcel of the ſame kind was ſent me <lb/>from
        another quarter. In both which I found a great <lb/>number of ſtrong hairs all over; ſo as
        to leave no <lb/>room for doubting but that this appearance is general <lb/>in the meconium
        of calves, in a natural way. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The reader will pleaſe to obſerve, that in neither <lb/>of theſe inſtances I could be
        deceived, if I had ever <lb/>ſo little reaſon to truſt to the judgment and fidelity of
        <lb/>thoſe, who ſupplied me with what I wanted. The <lb/>colour and conſiſtence of the
        meconium of a fœtus <lb/>is ſo very peculiar, and ſo widely different from that <lb/>of
        fæces formed out of ingeſted aliments, that none, <lb/>who have any knowledge in theſe
        matters, can miſ- <lb/>take the one for the other. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the mean time I omitted not to open the em- <lb/>bryo's of the cow-kind, ſuch as I
        could procure in the <lb/>ſhambles of the market-town I live in, and to examine <lb/>their
        meconium. The two moſt advanced towards <lb/>maturity, which I met with, had ſtiff long
        hairs <lb/>about the mouth, the eye-brows, the ears, and na- <lb/>vel, and a good many on
        the end of the tail; but <lb/>none on their ſkins. In neither of theſe, any more <lb/>than
        in the younger embryo's, which I examined <pb n="260"/>
        <lb/>was there ſo much as a ſingle hair to be found in <lb/>the meconium; for this plain
        reaſon, if I judge <lb/>right, to wit, becauſe they had not got hairs upon <lb/>their bodies
        of long enough continuance to become <lb/>looſe, and float in the liquor amnii. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>But as opportunities of coming at fœtus's of this <lb/>ſpecies, eſpecially ſuch as are
        remarkably nearer to <lb/>maturity than thoſe two I have juſt now mentioned, <lb/>are rare
        with us, I tried to ſupply that defect by <lb/>opening thoſe of other animals. Accordingly I
        pro- <lb/>cured ſix puppies, of the butcher-dog-kind, brought <lb/>forth at the full time,
        at one litter. Having taken <lb/>out the whole meconium of every one of them, after <lb/>the
        ſtricteſt ſearch, I could find no hairs in any part <lb/>of it. I had likewiſe an
        opportunity of opening a <lb/>colt, that died either in the birth, at the full time, <lb/>or
        immediately after, before its meconium was diſ- <lb/>charged; which I found in great
        quantities in its <lb/>rectum and colon. But neither here could I ſpy a <lb/>ſingle hair,
        though I examined whole pounds of it, <lb/>and that portion thereof moſt carefully, which
        was <lb/>lodged in the rectum, near the anus. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Theſe obſervations may ſeem at firſt view to claſh <lb/>with and contradict thoſe I
        have related: But, upon <lb/>cloſer conſideration, they will be found in reality to
        <lb/>confirm them, for this reaſon, to wit, that puppies <lb/>and colts, when brought forth,
        have no looſe hairs <lb/>on their bodies; but calves have in great numbers. <lb/>In the
        puppies and colt, which I examined, the <lb/>hairs were ſo firmly rooted on their ſkins,
        that I could <lb/>ſcarce pull any off with my thumb and fingers; <lb/>whereas in a ripe
        calf, new brought forth, many are <lb/>found quite looſened at their roots, and only adher-
          <pb n="261"/>
        <lb/>ing to their ſkin by the moiſture on it. Therefore <lb/>in the latter ſpecies, hairs
        from the ſurface may be, <lb/>and actually are, incorporated with the liquor amnii, <lb/>and
        along with it enter the mouth and alimentary <lb/>canal, which cannot be the caſe in the
        former. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>From theſe facts it is eaſy to draw ſuch inferences, <lb/>as are ſufficient to decide
        the controverſy, which we <lb/>are treating of; and prove inconteſtably, that the li-
        <lb/>quor amnii is in a conſtant natural way received into <lb/>the mouth, ſtomach, and
        inteſtines, and therefore <lb/>muſt contribute to the nutrition of the fœtus. </p>

        <lb/>For if we attentively conſider, that in the meco- <lb/>nium of an human fœtus no hairs
        are found, there <lb/>being no looſe hairs on its ſkin when it is born; <lb/>that in the
        meconium of unripe calves there are <lb/>none, before they are of ſo long continuance on
        their <lb/>bodies as to be looſened, and float in the liquor am- <lb/>nii; whereas in that
        of the ripe calves they are <lb/>found in great abundance, of the ſame colour with
        <lb/>thoſe of the ſkin, as appears by the example we had <lb/>occaſion to examine moſt
        particularly; and of ſuch <lb/>a length, ſtiffneſs, and thickneſs, and ſo conſtantly <lb/>to
        be met with, as cannot with any ſhew of reaſon <lb/>be imputed either to morbid concretion,
        or preter- <lb/>natural frame: If, I ſay, all theſe facts are atten- <lb/>tively conſidered,
        and duly weighed, the concluſion <lb/>I have drawn will, I hope, appear to follow from
        <lb/>them ſo naturally, that no candid and intelligent in- <lb/>quirer will call its truth
        in queſtion. </p>

          <lb/>After I had gone thus far upon my own bottom, <lb/>and while I was looking about me,
          in order to pick <pb n="262"/>
          <lb/>up more proofs, that might, as it were <hi rend="italic">ex ſuperabun-
            <lb/>danti</hi>, confirm and illuſtrate the doctrine, which I <lb/>was endeavouring to
          eſtabliſh, before I ſhould ven- <lb/>ture to publiſh it, I caſually found what, as I here
          <lb/>ſolemnly declare, I knew nothing of before, to wit, <lb/>that I was not the firſt,
          who had obſerved hairs in <lb/>the meconium of ripe calves, two authors having <lb/>been
          before-hand with me, to wit, Aldes and Swam- <lb/>merdam; the former in his <hi
            rend="italic">Epiſtola contra Harveium</hi>, <lb/>publiſhed in the firſt volume of the
            <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Ana- <lb/>tomica</hi> of Mangetus and Le Clerc: the latter
          in the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Biblia Naturæ</hi>. Aldes, a feigned name under <lb/>which
          Slade, an Amſterdam phyſician, conceals him- <lb/>ſelf, barely mentions the obſervation,
          without draw- <lb/>ing any inference from it, either on the one ſide <lb/>or the other.
          Swammerdam draws the ſame con- <lb/>cluſion with me; but, I think, he goes farther
          <lb/>than the obſervation can well juſtify, maintaining, <lb/>that it evidently follows
          from thence, that a calf <lb/>licks his own ſkin <hi rend="italic">in utero</hi>, thereby
          looſening the <lb/>hairs, and ſwallowing them down along with the <lb/>liquor amnii, its
          nouriſhment. See the whole paſſage, <lb/><hi rend="italic">Bibl. Natur.</hi> pag. 319. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>However that be, it is enough for my purpoſe to <lb/>have two ſuch authors concurring
          with me, as to <lb/>the reality of the fundamental fact, and quite ſaves <lb/>me the
          trouble of making any farther trials to con- <lb/>firm it. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>It is no wonder, that theſe paſſages eſcaped me, <lb/>who have ſpent almoſt all my
          time in practice, and <lb/>practical ſtudies, and who never was poſſeſſed of <lb/>either
          of theſe books; but, after I found them quoted, <lb/>was obliged to trouble two learned
          friends, at a di- <pb n="263"/>
          <lb/>ſtance, upon this occaſion, for my own ſatisfaction, <lb/>and that very lately. The
          one was ſo obliging as <lb/>to ſend me the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Anatomica</hi>;
          the other to <lb/>write out at large the paſſage from the <hi rend="italic">Biblia Na-
            <lb/>turæ</hi>. I ſay, it is no wonder the paſſages eſcaped <lb/>my notice, ſince they
          ſeem to have been overlooked <lb/>by not only all the particular writers on the fœtus,
          <lb/>ſince Aldes and Swammerdam, but likewiſe, for <lb/>aught I know, by all the lecturers
          on phyſiology in <lb/>Europe, preceding Auguſt 1753; at which time I <lb/>began to
          communicate by letters, what I then took to <lb/>be a diſcovery, to ſeveral correſpondents
          verſed in <lb/>theſe matters, both at home and abroad, as I can <lb/>vouch by their
          anſwers. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>So that I hope the public will do me the juſtice <lb/>to believe, that though I was
          not the firſt in point of <lb/>time, that made the fundamental obſervation, yet I <lb/>was
          obliged to no author for it; and that I have <lb/>drawn an important truth relating to the
          animal <lb/>oeconomy out of obſcurity, and eſtabliſhed it by <lb/>ſupplemental
          obſervations, as well as by reaſoning. </p>
