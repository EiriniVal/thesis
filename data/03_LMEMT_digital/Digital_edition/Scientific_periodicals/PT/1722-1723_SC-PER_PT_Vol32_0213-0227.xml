        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>HE ſincere and diſintereſted Regard for the Good <lb/>of
        Mankind, which you have always manifeſted, <lb/>as well in your extenſive private Practice,
        as in that <lb/>publick Poſt, which you have ſo long and ſo uſefully <lb/>fill'd, muſt
        affect you, I am ſure, with a great and ſen- <lb/>ſible Concern for the Deſtruction made
        among us by <lb/>that terrible Calamity the Small Pox. We have ſeen, <lb/>for ſome
        conſiderable Time paſt, above 100 Perſons <lb/><hi rend="italic">per</hi> Week in this City
        and Suburbs, taking one Week <lb/>with another, to be carry'd off by this Diſeaſe; a Con-
        <lb/>ſideration certainly that ought to diſpoſe us to enter <lb/>into any Meaſures, by which
        we may reaſonably hope <lb/>to put ſome Step to the Progreſs of ſo cruel a Di- <lb/>ſtemper. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>To this Purpoſe, Sir, the Method of Inoculation, <lb/>which has lately been introduced
        among us, is ſtrongly <lb/>recommended on the one hand, and has been oppoſed <lb/>with a
        great deal of Warmth and Zeal on the other. <pb n="214"/>
        <lb/>I have no Inclination to enter into this Contro- <lb/>verſy; it is in better and abler
        Hands: but, as the <lb/>Point in Diſpute is of the utmoſt Importance to Man- <lb/>kind, I
        heartily wiſh, that, without Paſſion, Preju- <lb/>dice, or private Views, it may be fairly
        and maturely <lb/>examin'd. In order to which, if the following Ex- <lb/>tracts and
        Computations, concerning the comparative <lb/>Danger of the Inoculated and Natural Small
        Pox, may <lb/>be of any Uſe to your ſelf, or to other impartial and <lb/>diſintereſted

      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Out of this Number the Oppoſers of Inoculation <lb/>affirm, that two Perſons died of
        the Inoculated Small <lb/>Pox; the Favourers of this Practice maintain, that their
        <lb/>Death was occaſioned by other Cauſes. If, to avoid <pb n="215"/>
        <lb/>diſpute, theſe two be allow'd to have died of Inocula- <lb/>tion, we muſt eſtimate the
        hazard of dying of the In- <lb/>oculated Small Pox, as far as can be collected from <lb/>our
        own Experience, to be that of 2 out of 182, or <lb/>one out of 91. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The Reverend Mr. <hi rend="italic">Mather</hi>, in a Letter dated <hi rend="italic"
          >March</hi>
        <lb/>10. 1721. from <hi rend="italic">Boſton</hi> in <hi rend="italic">New England</hi>,
        gives an Ac- <lb/>count, That <q rend="italic">of near 300 inoculated there, 5 or 6 died
          <lb/>upon it or after it, but from other Diſeaſes and Ac- <lb/>cidents, chiefly from
          having taken the Infection in the <lb/>common way by Inſpiration, before it could be given
          <lb/>them in this way of Tranſplantation </q>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>If, as we have done before, to avoid all occaſion of <lb/>diſpute, we allow 5 out of
        theſe 300 to have died of <lb/>the Small Pox by Inoculation, notwithſtanding what <lb/>Mr.
          <hi rend="italic">Mather</hi> has ſaid of their dying by other Acci- <lb/>dents or
        Diſeaſes; the hazard of Inoculation will <lb/>thence be determin'd to be that of 1 in about
        60. But <lb/>here it muſt be obſerv'd, that by all the Accounts <lb/>from <hi rend="italic"
          >New England</hi>, the Operators there appear not <lb/>to have been ſo cautious in the
        choice of their Subjects, <lb/>as here in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>. For Mr. <hi
          rend="italic">Mather</hi> tells us, that <lb/>the Perſons inoculated were <q rend="italic"
          >young and old, from 1 <lb/>Year to 70, weak and ſtrong </q>; and by other relations
        <lb/>we are inform'd, that <q rend="italic">Women with Child, and others <lb/>even in
          Childbed </q>, underwent the Operation. Appa- <lb/>rently the Greatneſs of the Danger they
        were in, from <lb/>the Infection in the natural Way, which then raged <lb/>among them with
        the utmoſt Fury, made them the <lb/>more adventurous. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>We come now, Sir, to the ſecond Part of our De- <lb/>ſign, which is to form an Eſtimate
        of the Hazard, <lb/>which all Mankind, one from another, are under of <lb/>dying of the
        natural Small Pox, that, by comparing <lb/>this with the Hazard of Inoculation, the Publick
        may <pb n="216"/>
        <lb/>be enabled to form a Judgment, whether or no the <lb/>Practice of Inoculation tends to
        the Preſervation of <lb/>Mankind, by leſſening the Danger to which they are <lb/>otherwiſe
        liable. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>With this View I have conſulted the Yearly Bills of <lb/>Mortality, as far back as the
        Year 1667, being the <lb/>Year after the Plague and the Fire of <hi rend="italic"
          >London</hi>, com- <lb/>prehending to the preſent Time the Space of 56 <lb/>Years, from 42
        of which I have given Extracts in the <lb/>two following Tables. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The firſt of theſe takes in the firſt 20 Years, diſtin- <lb/>guiſhing for every Year
        the total Number of Burials, <lb/>and likewiſe the Number that died of the Small Pox, in
        <lb/>two ſeparate Columns. The third Column ſhews, how <lb/>many died of the Small Pox out
        of every Thouſand that <lb/>were buried; and the fourth Column repreſents the
        <lb/>Proportion between thoſe that died of the Small Pox, <lb/>and the whole Number of
        Burials, by the neareſt Vul- <lb/>gar Fraction, having always 1 for the Numerator. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The ſecond Table gives the laſt 22 Years, after the <lb/>ſame manner, and at the bottom
        of each Table is given <lb/>the Total Number for each Series of Years, and like- <lb/>wiſe
        the Number that died each Year, taken at a Me- <lb/>dium, one Year with another: by which it
        appears, <lb/>that the Proportion between the Number of thoſe that <lb/>die of the Small
        Pox, and the whole Number of Bu- <lb/>rials, is very nearly the ſame, upon an Average for
        <lb/>each Series of Years. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The 14 intermediate Years between 1686 and 1701 <lb/>are left out, becauſe in the Bills
        for thoſe Years, the <lb/>Accounts of the Small Pox and Meaſles are not di-
        <lb/>ſtinguiſhed, as in the preceding and following Years, <lb/>but are join'd together in
        one Article, ſo that from them <lb/>no certain Account can be drawn of the Number of
        <lb/>Perſons, that died of the Small Pox. </p>

        <lb/>By theſe Tables it appears, that <hi rend="italic">upwards of ſeven <lb/><hi
            rend="roman">per Cent.</hi> or ſomewhat more than a fourteenth part of <lb/>Mankind, die
          of the Small Pox</hi>; and conſequently the <lb/>hazard of dying of that Diſtemper, to
        every individual <lb/>born into the World, is at leaſt that of one in four- <lb/>teen. And
        that this Hazard encreaſes after the Birth, <lb/>as the Child advances in Age, will appear
        from what <lb/>follows. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>From this Eſtimate it is demonſtrable, that, in the <lb/>Caſe of Perſons actually
        having the Small Pox, the <lb/>Hazard that they run, one with another, of dying of <lb/>that
        Diſtemper, is greater than that of one in fourteen; <lb/>or, which is the ſame thing, <hi
          rend="italic">there muſt be fewer than <lb/>thirteen, that recover, for one that dies of
          the Small <lb/>Pox</hi>. For ſince one fourteenth part of Mankind die <lb/>of the Small
        Pox, and the other thirteen parts die of <lb/>other Diſeaſes; if theſe thirteen have all had
        the Small <lb/>Pox, and recover'd from it, before they fell ill of thoſe <lb/>other Diſeaſes
        of which they died, then juſt thirteen <lb/>will have recover'd from the Small Pox, for one
        that <lb/>dies of that Diſtemper: but, as it is notorious, that <lb/>great Numbers,
        eſpecially of young Children, die of <lb/>other Diſeaſes, without ever having the Small Pox,
        it <lb/>is plain, that fewer than thirteen muſt recover from <lb/>this Diſtemper, for one
        that dies of it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>To determine exactly how many of theſe thirteen <lb/>Parts of Mankind, die without
        having the Small Pox, <lb/>is a very difficult Task: but is eaſy to ſee, that a
        <lb/>conſiderable Deduction is to be made from them. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the firſt place, the two Articles of <hi rend="italic">Stilborn</hi> and <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Abortive Children</hi>, which are put into the yearly Bills, <lb/>as part of
        the Number of Burials, are unqueſtionably <lb/>to be deducted. </p>
      <pb n="220"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>With theſe two, Sir, you will not I believe, think it <lb/>unreaſonable to join the
        following Heads, which, by <lb/>the beſt Information I can procure, comprehend only
        <lb/>very young Children, or at moſt not above one or two <lb/>Years of Age: <hi
          rend="italic">Overlaid, Chryſoms and Infants, Con- <lb/>vulſions, Horſeſhoehead,
          Headmoldſhot, Teeth, Wa- <lb/>ter in the Head, Worms, Rickets, Livergrown, Chin-
          <lb/>Cough, and Hooping-Cough</hi>, which Articles in the <lb/>Yearly Bills for 22 Years
        laſt paſt, amount at a Medi- <lb/>um to 386 in each 1000, of the whole Number of
        <lb/>Burials. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It is true indeed, that, in all Probability, ſome <lb/>ſmall part of theſe muſt have
        gone thro' the Small Pox, <lb/>and therefore ought not to be deducted out of the Ac-
        <lb/>count: but then, on the other hand, as it is certain, <lb/>that of the remaining
        614/1000 of Mankind, that are above <lb/>one or two Years of Age, there are great Numbers,
        <lb/>that never have the Small Pox, it will I preſume be <lb/>judged to be no unequal
        Suppoſition, if I ſuppoſe all <lb/>that are contain'd under the Heads abovemention'd, to
        <lb/>have miſs'd that Diſtemper, when by way of Com- <lb/>penſation, I allow all the
        remainder of Mankind to <lb/>undergo it; which Conceſſion is ſo large, that it will
        <lb/>abundantly make up for what I aſſume too much in the <lb/>former Suppoſition. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Allowing therefore, that out of every 1000 Chil- <lb/>dren that are born, 386 die under

        other die of that Diſtemper; it follows, <lb/>that the Hazard of dying of it, to the
        remainder of <lb/>Mankind, above one or two Years of Age, who are <lb/>all ſuppoſed to
        undergo that Diſeaſe ſooner or later, is <lb/>that of 72 out of 614, or nearly 2 out of 17:
        ſo that <pb n="221"/>
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">no more, than between 7 and 8, can recover from that <lb/>Diſtemper,

      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This Conſideration ſhews the Fallacy of one plau- <lb/>ſible Argument, that has been
        often made uſe of on <lb/>occaſion of the preſent Diſputes about Inoculation: <lb/>Which is,
        that whatever be the Danger of dying of the <lb/>Small Pox, to thoſe that actually have that
        Diſeaſe, yet, <lb/>as great Numbers of Perſons never have the Small Pox <lb/>at all, this
        Danger is what any particular Perſon may <lb/>never be in; and therefore it will be Madneſs
        to under- <lb/>go the hazard of Inoculation, be it great or ſmall, in <lb/>order to prevent
        a Diſeaſe, which poſſibly may never <lb/>befal one. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>For if two parts in ſeventeen of all Mankind, that <lb/>are above one or two Years of
        Age, muſt ſooner or <lb/>later die of the Small Pox, it is plain, that how many <lb/>parts
        ſoever of theſe ſeventeen are ſuppoſed to eſcape <lb/>that Diſtemper, the Mortality among
        the remainder, <lb/>who undergo it, muſt in proportion be ſo much the <lb/>greater. As for
        inſtance, if 7 parts eſcape having the <lb/>Small Pox, and 10 undergo it, then 2 out of 10,
        or 1 <lb/>out of 5, that have the Small Pox, muſt die of that <lb/>Diſeaſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>And as it can never be known, whether or no any <lb/>particular Perſon be one of thoſe,
        that are to have the <lb/>Small Pox; his Hazard of dying of that Diſtemper, <lb/>being made
        up of the Hazard of having it, and the Ha- <lb/>zard of dying of it, if he has it, will be
        exactly the <lb/>ſame, namely, that of 2 in 17, or 1 in 8 or 9, whether <lb/>the proportion
        of Mankind, that eſcape having the <lb/>Small Pox, be great or ſmall. </p>
      <pb n="222"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>But as what has been ſaid concerning the Hazard of <lb/>the natural Small Pox, is taken
        from an Account of 42 <lb/>Years; whereas the Hazard of Inoculation is eſtimated <lb/>only
        from what has happen'd in the ſpace of about 18 <lb/>Months, ſince which time it had its
        firſt Riſe among <lb/>us; it will perhaps be asked by ſome Perſons, why <lb/>we do not
        likewiſe make the Eſtimate of the hazard of <lb/>the natural Small Pox, from the laſt two
        Years alone, <lb/>without running back into ſo great a number of Years, <lb/>before
        Inoculation was begun? </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>To which we anſwer, that the Proportion of thoſe <lb/>that die of the Small Pox, varies
        ſo much in different <lb/>Years, as appears from the Tables above, that it was
        <lb/>impoſſible to come at any Certainty in this point, from <lb/>the conſideration of the
        two laſt Years alone: and if <lb/>any one ſuſpects us of Partiality in proceeding after the
        <lb/>manner we have done, he need only caſt his Eyes upon <lb/>the ſecond Table, where he
        will find, that the Morta- <lb/>lity of the natural Small Pox, for the two laſt Years,
        <lb/>has conſiderably exceeded the Medium we have de- <lb/>termin'd, from taking in two and
        fourty Years. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>There is another Method, which, if it were put in <lb/>practice in ſeveral large Towns,
        or Pariſhes, and for a <lb/>ſufficient Number of Years, would enable us to come <lb/>at a
        nearer and ſtill more certain Computation of the <lb/>Proportion between thoſe that recover,
        and thoſe that <lb/>die of the Small Pox: which is, to ſend a careful Per- <lb/>ſon once a
        Year, from houſe to houſe, to enquire <lb/>what Perſons have had the Small Pox, and how many
        <lb/>have died of it, in the preceding Year. This has been <lb/>done by Dr. <hi

          >Yorkſhire, <hi rend="roman">&amp;c.</hi></hi> and the ſame was done at <hi rend="italic"

          Royal Society, the following Account of <lb/>the Succeſs of Inoculation in and about <hi
            rend="italic">Boſton</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">New <lb/>England</hi>, was procured at
          my Deſire, by my Inge- <lb/>nious Friend Dr. <hi rend="italic">Nesbitt</hi>, from Capt.
            <hi rend="italic">John Osborne</hi>, <lb/>who reſided in that Town and Neighbourhood
          during <lb/>the whole time of that Practice. I think proper to <lb/>inſert it here, as it
          confirms the Extract given above <lb/>from Mr. <hi rend="italic">Mather</hi>'s Relation,
          and is a more particular <lb/>Account of the Matter of Fact, than any that I have <lb/>yet
          ſeen. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>In <hi rend="italic">May</hi>, 1721. the Small Pox was, by the Provi- <lb/>dence of
          God, brought into the Town of <hi rend="italic">Boston</hi>; in <lb/><hi rend="italic"
            >June</hi> it began to ſpread pretty much, and in the <lb/>Month of <hi rend="italic"
            >July</hi> it was got into moſt parts of the Town, <lb/>and conſiderable Number of
          People died of it. At <lb/>this time Inoculation was firſt put in practice by <lb/>Dr. <hi
            rend="italic">Boyleſton</hi>, who then perform'd it upon his own <lb/>Child and a
          Negro-Servant, who both did well; not- <lb/>withſtanding which, this Attempt gave great
          Uneaſineſs <lb/>to the Neighbours. However the Practice went on, <lb/>to the Number of
          about 40 Perſons, one of which was <lb/>a Woman <note n="*" place="bottom"
            rend="align-center size(0.7) italic">
            <lb/>* Mrs. <hi rend="roman">Dixwell</hi>. </note> of about 40 or 45 Years of Age, who
          got <lb/>well over the Small Pox, as her Husband publickly <lb/>declared, but had been
          before troubled with Hyſte- <lb/>rick Fits, of which ſhe died ſome little time after.
          <lb/>When about 70 Perſons had paſſed under the Opera- <lb/>tion, myſelf and Wife, who had
          hitherto been at a <lb/>Place called <hi rend="italic">Roxbury</hi>, a Mile from <hi
            rend="italic">Boſton</hi>, went into <pb n="226"/>
          <lb/>Town and received the Small Pox by Inoculation. We <lb/>had it with all the
          Gentleneſs and Moderation that <lb/>was poſſible, neither of us having an hundred Pu-
          <lb/>ſtules, or being ſenſible of any Fever worth mention- <lb/>ing; ſo that we did not
          find it neceſſary to keep our <lb/>Beds for it. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>In <hi rend="italic">Auguſt</hi> the Small Pox in the natural Way proved <lb/>more
          mortal, and Inoculation made a greater Progreſs, <lb/>the People continuing to come into
          the Practice of it. <lb/>A ſecond Perſon that died after Inoculation, was an
          <lb/>Apothecary's Houſekeeper, that was out of Town, <lb/>till an <hi rend="italic"
            >Indian</hi> Maid got the Diſtemper in the ſame <lb/>Houſe, and remov'd, and died. Upon
          which this Wo- <lb/>man coming to Town, her Maſter undertook to per- <lb/>form the
          Operation upon her, which by the way was <lb/>the firſt and laſt that he ever perform'd;
          and on the <lb/>third Day after the Inoculation, the Small Pox came <lb/>out upon her very
          full; from which it was plain, that <lb/>ſhe had taken the Infection before, in the common
          <lb/>way. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The third Perſon that died after being inoculated, <lb/>was a <note n="†"

          <lb/>great and extreme Infirmity of Body, as myſelf was <lb/>Witneſs, that we fear'd he
          would have lived but a <lb/>ſhort time under it. His Friends much perſuaded him <lb/>to
          make uſe of Inoculation, believing that it would <lb/>have carry'd off his Illneſs; but
          when he made the Ex- <lb/>periment, he had not Strength to go thro' with it. He <lb/>was
          about 45 Years of Age, and by the way was a <lb/>Gentleman of great Worth and Piety. </p>

          <lb/>of great Indiſpoſition of Body, and weak, as was her <lb/>Brother. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The fifth, that died upon Inoculation, was a Wo- <lb/>man Servant in a Houſe, where
          the whole Family, to <lb/>the number of eight, were inoculated at the ſame time. <lb/>She
          lay in a cold upper Room during her Illneſs, and <lb/>was much neglected, the whole Family
          being down <lb/>together, ſo that ſhe died merely for want of a little <lb/>Attendance.
          This was in the Town of <hi rend="italic">Roxbury</hi>, <lb/>where obſerve, that 13 Men,
          Maſters of Families, got <lb/>the Small Pox, and all died; which inclined the People
          <lb/>to make uſe of Inoculation, having before been much <lb/>againſt it, and there were
          43 Men inoculated there, <lb/>who all did well. The <note n="*" place="bottom"

          <lb/>Succeſs it was attended; and then whole Families came <lb/>into it, and underwent the
