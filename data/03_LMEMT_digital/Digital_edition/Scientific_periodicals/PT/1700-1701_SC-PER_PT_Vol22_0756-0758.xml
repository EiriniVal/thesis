          <lb/>According to your deſire, I ſend you a more exact <lb/>account of the Caſe, I
          mention'd to you in my laſt. <lb/>All the following particulars I had from the Mother.
          <lb/>Madam <hi rend="italic">R—</hi>'s Daughter was between two and three <lb/>years old,
          when on a ſudden ſhe complain'd of a very <lb/>violent Head-ach: She was alſo obſerv'd to
          be feaveriſh, <lb/>and extremely reſtleſs. At the ſame time her Eye-lids <pb n="757"/>
          <lb/>did very much ſwell, and they were ſo heavy, that <lb/>one could hardly open her Eyes
          but with a great <choice>
            <corr>deal</corr>
            <sic>dea</sic>
          </choice>
          <lb/>of pain. Theſe ſymptoms did continue for three or <lb/>four months, tho ſometimes
          more or leſs violent. At <lb/>laſt, ſhe fell into Convulſive motions of her Arms,
          <lb/>Legs, and other parts, and theſe were very fierce for <lb/>two days, till ſhe began
          to bleed by the Noſe, the <lb/>Mouth, the Ears and the Eyes. The Linnen Cloaths, <lb/>that
          were then applied to the Eye-lids, were all wet <lb/>and bloody. This <hi rend="italic"
            >Hæmorragia</hi> laſted above a day; <lb/>and what is more remarkable, When it was
          expected <lb/>that the Child ſhould be extremely weakned, ſhe found <lb/>herſelf ſo well
          freed from her illneſs, that ſhe came to <lb/>her gaiety again, and ask'd for ſome
          Victuals. With- <lb/>in twelve months after ſhe had four of theſe <hi rend="italic"
            >Attacks</hi>, <lb/>but not ſo great: in particular, the Convulſion fits were <lb/>very
          inconſiderable, in compariſon of the firſt. The <lb/>ſame Symptoms did not return again
          above two or three <lb/>times every year, and the Head-ach did not continue <lb/>above
          eight days before the <hi rend="italic">Bleeding</hi>: and even then <lb/>it was much more
          ſupportable. About two months <lb/>ago I was ſent for to ſee the Girl, who is now ſeven
          <lb/>years old. I found her in Bed, complaining extremely <lb/>of a Head-ach, attended
          with a Feaver, a great <hi rend="italic">Catharr</hi>, <lb/>and ſuch a ſhortneſs of
          breath, as if ſhe had had a <hi rend="italic">Pe- <lb/>ripneumonia</hi>. She had been
          three days in that conditi- <lb/>on. I told the Mother, my opinion was ſhe ſhould be
          <lb/>blooded preſently; to which ſhe readily conſented, tel- <lb/>ling me withal, that ſhe
          did not doubt but theſe were <lb/>the fore-runners of the ſame <hi rend="italic"
            >Hemorrage</hi> the Girl had <lb/>before. This made me the more inſiſt upon the open-
          <lb/>ing of a Vein; but it being very late, it was put off till <lb/>next <choice>
            <corr>morning</corr>
            <sic>moruing</sic>
          </choice>, and then indeed it was needleſs; for very <lb/>early in the morning, after ſome
          Convulſion fits, ſhe began <lb/>to bleed from the Noſe, the Mouth, <hi rend="italic"
            >&amp;c.</hi> I was very <lb/>ſorry they did not ſend for me, to be an Eye-witneſs of
          <lb/>this unuſual Evacuation; for when I came it was al- <pb n="758"/>
          <lb/>moſt over. I could only ſee a little bleeding from the <lb/>Mouth; but all the people
          in the houſe told me they <lb/>had ſeen the Blood drop from all theſe parts. The Girl
          <lb/>was then pretty well, without any Feaver or <hi rend="italic">Catharr</hi>: <lb/>She
          could breathe freely, was in good humour, and <lb/>had a good Stomach; and ever ſince had
          continued in <lb/>perfect health. Now, ſeeing the returns are not ſo fre- <lb/>quent, and
          the Symptoms are ſo notably diminiſh'd, I <lb/>am in hopes this may ſoon have an end: or
          at leaſt 'tis <lb/>very probable to me, that theſe accidents will totally <lb/>ceaſe,
          whenever ſhe comes to have have her <hi rend="italic">Catamenia</hi>. </p>
