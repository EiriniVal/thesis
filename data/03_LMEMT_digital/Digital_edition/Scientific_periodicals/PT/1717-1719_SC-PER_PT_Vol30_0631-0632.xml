        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi>S nothing is more apt to lead us to the Know- <lb/>ledge of the
        ſeveral Diſtempers which affect the <lb/>Human Body, and to acquaint us with the juſt Prog-
        <lb/>noſticks of the like Caſes, than the opening of diſt- <lb/>emper'd Perſons. I hop'd it
        would not be an unaccepta- <lb/>ble inſtance of my Zeal and Readineſs to ſerve the <lb/>Moſt
        Honourable the <hi rend="italic">Royal Society</hi> upon all occaſions, <lb/>to deſire you
        to preſent them with the following ac- <lb/>count of the Diſſection I lately made of a
        Child. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This Child was five Months old, and was ſo ema- <lb/>ciated, that he appear'd rather to
        have decreaſed, than <lb/>to have encreaſed in Bulk, from the time of his <lb/>Birth; his
        whole Body not weighing above five Pounds. <lb/>The Skin and Muſcles of the Abdomen were
        very <lb/>thin, but the Peritoneum was preternaturally thick. <lb/>The Ventriculus was more
        like to an Inteſtin than to <lb/>a Stomach, its length being five Inches, and its breadth
        <lb/>but one Inch. The Coats of it were thick and fleſhy, <lb/>and the Cavity very
        inconſiderable. The Pylorus, and <lb/>almoſt half of the Duodenum were Cartilaginous, and
        <lb/>ſomething inclin'd to an Oſſification, ſo that no Nou- <lb/>riſhment could have paſſed
        into the Inteſtins, tho' the <lb/>Stomach had been capable of containing it, which
        <lb/>makes it no Wonder that the Body was ſo emaciated. <lb/>There were ſcarce any
        foot-ſteps of the Omentum to <lb/>be ſeen, even at the Bottom of the Stomach, to which
        <lb/>it uſually adheres. </p>
      <pb n="632"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The right Lobe of the Lungs adhered firmly to the <lb/>Ribs and had three
        Exulcerations, which contain'd pu- <lb/>rulent Matter. It was ſo very thin and compact, that
        <lb/>it ſeem'd as if that Lobe had never been of uſe in <lb/>Reſpiration. The left Lobe was
        of a more florid Red, <lb/>ſpongy, and free from any Adheſion. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Upon enquiring after the Symptoms this Child had <lb/>been affected with, his Mother
        told me, he ſeem'd to <lb/>be healthy till he was about a Month old, when he <lb/>was ſeized
        with a violent Vomiting, and a Stoppage <lb/>of Urine and Stool. Some time after, both theſe
        <lb/>became more regular, but the Vomiting ſtill continued. <lb/>He ſeem'd to have a great
        Appetite, taking what Suck, <lb/>Drink, or other Food was offer'd him, with a kind of
        <lb/>eagerneſs; but he immediately threw it all up again. He <lb/>had all along breathed
        freely, and had no Cough, <lb/>notwithſtanding the Exulcerations above mention'd. <lb/>This
        confirm'd me in the Opinion that he had never <lb/>Breath'd, by the right Lobe of the Lungs. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>There could be nothing more emaciated than this <lb/>Child was; and it ſeems to be
        worth conſidering, <lb/>whether his Illneſs might not be owing in a great <lb/>meaſure to
        the want of the Omentum, (for he ſeem'd <lb/>never to have had any); as alſo, whence it is
        that <lb/>this Part is generally conſum'd in an Atrophy, and <lb/>in moſt Hydropical Caſes,
        except where it ſelf is more <lb/>eſpecially concerned. </p>
