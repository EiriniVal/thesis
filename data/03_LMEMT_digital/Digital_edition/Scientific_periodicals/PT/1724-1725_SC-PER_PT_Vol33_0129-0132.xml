        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>N the Year 1704. <hi rend="italic">Peter Coffin</hi>, Eſq; of
          <hi rend="italic">Exeter</hi> in <lb/><hi rend="italic">New England</hi>, being then
        ſeventy four Years of <lb/>Age, had taken a great Surfeit, as 'twas thought, by
        <lb/>drinking cold Water, in a very hot Day, and when he <lb/>had heated himſelf in the
        Woods. This Surfeit ſettled <lb/>principally in his right Side, but gave him a racking
        <lb/>Pain all over his Body, and particularly depriv'd him <lb/>of the Uſe of his right Arm:
        In this Condition he kept <lb/>his Houſe and Bed for nine Weeks, and his Recovery,
        <lb/>conſidering his Age, was deſpaired of; when a Son of <lb/>his, from whom I had the
        Relation, making a Viſit to <lb/>his Father, propoſed the Sweating of him in Turff: <lb/>The
        Father readily agreed to it, having uſed many <lb/>Medicines, from other Phyſicians, without
        any Effect. <lb/>Immediately Orders were given to cut a large Oven full <lb/>of Turff; the
        Pieces might be to eighteen Inches ſquare. <lb/>The Turff it ſelf was of <hi rend="italic"
          >Engliſh</hi> Graſs, and only the <lb/>Swerd, or Top of the Earth, with the Graſs. Before
        <lb/>the Turff was put into the Oven, the Doctor rubb'd <pb n="130"/>
        <lb/>the graſſy Side of the Turff, with ſome Spirit, or Oyl, <lb/>and then doubled the
        Graſs-ſides together, and ſo ſet <lb/>them in. When they were well baked, which was in
        <lb/>about two Hours, he took them out, and made a Bed <lb/>of them upon the Floor, (the
        Place for the Head raiſed); <lb/>as ſoon as that was done, he ordered his Father to be
        <lb/>taken out of his Bed without his Shirt, but wrapp'd up <lb/>in a Sheet, and laid upon
        the hot Turff, and then pro- <lb/>ceeded to cover him over witht the reſt of the Turff,
        <lb/>more eſpecially on his Side, where the Seat of his Pain <lb/>was, but they laid none on
        his Breaſt or Head; then <lb/>they cover'd him with Blankets to keep the Heat in: <lb/>While
        the Father was in this Bath, the Son gave him <lb/>warm Cordials, to prevent fainting, which
        he was in great <lb/>Danger of; after he had lain thus about three Quarters <lb/>of an Hour,
        which was as long as he could bear it, he <lb/>was put naked into the Bed very well warm'd,
        where, <lb/>in a few Minutes, he fell aſleep, and ſweat to that De- <lb/>gree, that it run,
        thro' his Pillow and Bed, upon the <lb/>Floor. After about two Hours Sleep they dry'd him,
        <lb/>and put him on warm Cloaths, and the old Gentleman <lb/>found himſelf much eaſed and
        refreſhed: This was in <lb/>the Morning; and before Night, he walked about the <lb/>Houſe
        comfortably, his Pain being in a manner all gone; <lb/>the next Day the Doctor repeated his
        Cordials, and the <lb/>fourth Day he ſweat his Father a ſecond Time, in the <lb/>ſame manner
        as above; and the next, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the fifth <lb/>Day, he went abroad about
        his Buſineſs, and lived <lb/>eleven Years afterwards in perfect Health, and free from
        <lb/>Pain. The Doctor tells me, great Care muſt be taken <lb/>that the Patient do not lie
        too long in the Turff, and <lb/>that even a Quarter of an Hour may be ſufficient for
        <lb/>ſome Perſons; and when e'er the Patient begins to fetch <lb/>his Breath ſhort, or
        faint, he muſt be put to Bed im- <lb/>mediately, and the Phyſician, or Operator, muſt by no
          <pb n="131"/>
        <lb/>means omit his Cordials. I ſhould have been glad to <lb/>have made this Account yet
        more perfect, by acquaint- <lb/>ing you, what the Specifick was the Doctor put upon <lb/>the
        Turff, before he ſet them into the Oven, but I <lb/>could not poſſibly prevail upon him to
        tell me. As to <lb/>the Matter of Fact, or Story of curing the old Gentle- <lb/>man, in this
        new and wonderful Manner, it was fam'd <lb/>throughout the Country in the Day of it; but the
        Par- <lb/>ticulars I lately had an Opportunity of having from the <lb/>Son, who ſo happily
        made the Experiment. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Houſes, to ſweat in, were common among the <hi rend="italic">Ab- <lb/>origines</hi>,
        when the <hi rend="italic">Engliſh</hi> firſt came into <hi rend="italic">New Eng-
          <lb/>land</hi>, tho' now but little uſed. A Gentleman of the <lb/>Iſland of <hi
          rend="italic">Nantucket</hi>, where the <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi> ſometimes
        <lb/>practiſe it, even at this Day, or very lately, gives me <lb/>the following Relation. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The Cave was uſually four Foot high, and to eight <lb/>Foot Diameter; the Roof
        ſupported with Sticks or <lb/>Boards, covered with Earth, and they dug it in the <lb/>Side
        of a Hill, and, as near as could be, to ſome River, <lb/>Pond, or Place of Water: The
        Entrance into this Cave <lb/>was ſmall, and the Door (when any Perſon was ſweating) <lb/>was
        covered with a Blanket or Skin; near the Cave they <lb/>make a good large Fire, and heat a
        Parcel of Stones, to <lb/>the Quantity of five hundred Weight, and roll them in
        <lb/>red-hot, piling them up in the middle of the Cave; <lb/>when this is done, the <hi
          rend="italic">Indians</hi> go in naked, and ſet <lb/>round the heated Stones as many as
        pleaſe; as ſoon as <lb/>they begin to grow faint, which may be in a Quarter of <lb/>an Hour,
        they come out, and plunge themſelves all <lb/>over in the Water for a Minute or two, and
        then in <lb/>again, as long as they can well bear it, and ſo in the <lb/>Water a ſecond
        Time, and then dreſs themſelves. This <lb/>has been uſed with Succeſs for Colds, Surfeits,
        Sciati- <lb/>ca's, and Pains fixed in the Limbs; and even the <hi rend="italic">Eng-</hi>
        <pb n="132"/>
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">liſh</hi> have many times found Relief by it. I don't un-
        <lb/>derſtand, but that it may be practis'd at any Time of <lb/>the Year, without Hazard or
        Inconvenience. The <hi rend="italic">In- <lb/>dians</hi> often uſed it before, and after
        long Journies, <lb/>Hunting or Voyages, to ſtrengthen and refreſh them- <lb/>ſelves. </p>
