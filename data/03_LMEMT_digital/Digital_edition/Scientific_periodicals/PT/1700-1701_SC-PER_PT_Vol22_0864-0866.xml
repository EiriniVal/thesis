        S. <lb/>to the Publiſher, concerning a very extraordinary <lb/>Periodical <hi rend="roman"

        <lb/>SIR, </salute>
      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi> Some years ſince receiv'd an account of a ſurprizing ill-
        <lb/>neſs, from the perſon who had labour'd under it: The <lb/>ſame has been atteſted to me
        by his Wife and ſeveral of <lb/>his acquaintance, and therefore I think it may deſerve
        <lb/>Credit. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Mr <hi rend="italic">H.</hi> formerly a Servant to <hi rend="italic">Queen
        Dowager</hi>, of late <lb/>to Mrs <hi rend="italic">Jennings</hi>, of <hi rend="italic"
          >Burton</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Somerſetſhire</hi>; had (from <lb/>his Infancy, as he
        has been inform'd, but to his certain <lb/>knowledge) from as far back as he can remember,
        up to <lb/>the twenty fourth year of his age, a <hi rend="italic">Periodical Hæmorrhage</hi>
        <lb/>in one of his Thumbs. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> of the Eruption was about the full of the <lb/>Moon,
        ſeldom more than a day before or after it. The <lb/>Orifice (to ſpeak more exactly) on the
        Right ſide of the <lb/>Nail of the Left Thumb. He has not known the Blood <lb/>to be leſs in
        weight at any one Turn, or Periodical Diſ- <lb/>charge, than four ounces; and is poſitive,
        that when he <lb/>came to be ſixteen years of age, the quantity was then en- <lb/>creas'd to
        half a pound at each eruption; he and his <lb/>friends having often view'd the quantity, and
        found it to <lb/>be thus much. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Manner</hi> of the Flux was alſo remarkable; for, <lb/>without
        any Pain of Head, Streightneſs of Breath, or any <lb/>ſigns of Fulneſs, or other Symptoms
        whatever obſerved <lb/>by him, excepting only a ſtiffneſs, on the utmoſt Joynt <pb n="865"/>
        <lb/>of the ſaid (Left) Thumb; the Blood uſed to ſpin out, <lb/>with a conſiderable force,
        on a ſudden, in ſeveral little <lb/>ſtreams, and continue ſo to do, until the greater part
        of <lb/>the quantity was diſcharged. Under this diſcharge, how- <lb/>ever copious, he was
        ſtrong and vigorous to the age of <lb/>twenty four, from his moſt early and tender years. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>At that age (of 24) finding this Evacuation trouble- <lb/>ſome, and being uneaſie under
        it, he ſear'd with a hot <lb/>Iron the part, which uſed to open, and give vent to the
        <lb/>flux of Blood. I ſaw that part, it was hard and callous <lb/>to the diameter of ¼ of an
        inch. The ſearing had ſtopt <lb/>the Hæmorrhage to the day I took this account, (which
        <lb/>was on <hi rend="italic">Dec.</hi> 11. 1697,) that is, about twenty years. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This ſtoppage was in its effects very dangerous, and of <lb/>ill conſequence; for
        within one quarter of a year after it <lb/>he fell into a <hi rend="italic">Sputum
          Sanguinis</hi>; bringing up from his <lb/>Lungs vaſt quantities of Blood. This new
        Complaint, <lb/>together with a Cough attending it, reduced him very <lb/>low; ſo that his
        Phyſician, old Dr <hi rend="italic">Dike</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Somerſetſhire</hi>,
        <lb/>(a perſon of great Learning and Experience in our Pro- <lb/>feſſion) thought him
        utterly loſt in a Conſumption; but <lb/>by frequent Bleeding, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
        deliver'd him from this <hi rend="italic">Hæ- <lb/>moptoe</hi>: yet not with that Relief
        which was expected: <lb/>For in a very little time the Patient fell into a moſt vio-
        <lb/>lent Colic; from no other occaſion (that he could diſ- <lb/>cover) than his late
        illneſs, putting on a new form, and <lb/>the matter ſettling on the Bowels. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This Colic was in good meaſure overcome by Purging <lb/>Medicines; but a diſpoſition to
        it ſtill remains; for he <lb/>has ever ſince been often troubled with it (as alſo with a
        <lb/>Spitting of Blood) on the leaſt exceſs of Cold or Mo- <lb/>tion. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In ſhort, he has, ever ſince the ſtoppage of that firſt <lb/>Hæmorrhage, been weak,
        ſickly, of a ſallow, faint look; <lb/>much impair'd as to health, in compariſon to what he
          <pb n="866"/>
        <lb/>enjoy'd during the time of its Periodical Returns; and <lb/>gives an Argument, <hi
          rend="italic">That when Nature has choſen, and for <lb/>ſome length of time, exerciſed new
          and extraordinary me- <lb/>thods of Oeconomy, ſhe ſeems to be as fond of their Continu-
          <lb/>ance, as at other times, and in her moſt regular ſtate, ſhe is <lb/>of that which is
          her moſt uſual and ordinary courſe</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>There is a further uſe to be made of this, and ſuch <lb/>like Monthly Hemorrhages, <hi
          rend="italic">in Men</hi>; whither by the <lb/>Thumb, (as in the preſent caſe) or <hi
          rend="italic">per penem</hi>; (of which <lb/>there have been in this Country two
        conſiderable Inſtances <lb/>in my time) or any other part of the Body. For theſe
        <lb/>Evacuations being analogous to the <hi rend="italic">Menſes</hi> in Women, <lb/>Confute
        the opinion of all ſuch as derive that Diſcharge <lb/>from a <hi rend="italic">Fermentum
          Uterinum</hi>. How can we think the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Menſes</hi> come from ſuch a
        Local Ferment; when a Diſ- <lb/>charge, in all reſpects equivalent to them, takes place,
        <lb/>where no ſuch ferment is, or can be ſuppos'd. </p>
