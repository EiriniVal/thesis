        <lb/><hi rend="roman">V.</hi> A Letter to the Publiſher from Mr <hi rend="roman"
          >Buſſiere</hi>, <lb/>F. R. S. Concerning a triple Bladder, <hi rend="roman">&amp;c.</hi>
      </head>
      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi>Ccording to my promiſe, I ſend you the de- <lb/>ſcription and
        figure of the triple Bladder which <lb/>you ſaw lately, at a meeting of the Royal Society;
        it <lb/>is ſo extraordinary a caſe, that I do not queſtion but it <lb/>will be be very
        acceptable to you. There is indeed ſome <lb/>account of a double Bladder found in the body
        of <lb/>ſome men; as for inſtance, that which was found in <lb/>the body of the famous and
        learned <hi rend="italic">Caſaubon</hi>; but there <lb/>is none of three Urinary Bladders in
        the body of a man. <lb/>I do not ſay however that the ſame caſe might not <lb/>have been in
        ſome others, but there is no mention <lb/>made as yet in any Author that I know; the opening
        <lb/>of dead bodies is too much neglected; and I do not <lb/>queſtion but if Phyſicians were
        a little more careful to <lb/>ſearch, or cauſe to be ſearched in the bodies of them
        <lb/>that dye of extraordinary diſtempers, they would <lb/>find ſometimes, that which they
        attribute to the <lb/>alteration of the blood or humour, dependeth meerly <lb/>on an
        extraordinary conformation of parts. This tri- <lb/>ple Bladder found in the body of the
        late Mr <hi rend="italic">Booth</hi> will <lb/>be a proof thereof; but before I give the
        deſcripti- <lb/>on of it, I think it neceſſary to give you an account of <lb/>the Symptoms
        which that Gentleman did undergo by <lb/>the conformation of his Bladder, and of the cauſe
        of <lb/>his death. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In his beſt health, he could not make his water in a <lb/>full and continual ſtream,
        the Urine running out but <lb/>by little and little, and with great efforts of inſpiration,
        <lb/>chiefly when there was but little quantity of it in the <pb n="753"/>
        <lb/>Bladder, which did fatigue him very much, though the <lb/>paſſing of the Urine through
        the neck of the Bladder <lb/>was not painful; except the two or three laſt years of <lb/>his
        life, becauſe of a thick <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi>, which then diſ- <lb/>charged with the
        Urine. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>That <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> growing in greater quantity of late, <lb/>made him
        apprehenſive it had been cauſed by a Stone <lb/>in his Bladder; upon ſuch thoughts he
        apply'd himſelf <lb/>to one, in order to be ſearched by him, who <lb/>accordingly
        introducing his Catheter, and meeting <lb/>with ſome reſiſtance in the <hi rend="italic"
          >Urethra</hi>, did force the Ca- <lb/>theter through the Membranes, and made ſuch dila-
        <lb/>ceration in them, that the Patient loſt immediately a <lb/>great quantity of Blood;
        which bleeding continuing <lb/>for ten days, without his ſeeking for any help, brought
        <lb/>him under very great torments, by reaſon the blood be- <lb/>ing grumulous in the <hi
          rend="italic">Urethra</hi>, could not be forced out <lb/>but by very violent efforts and
        acute pain, which cauſed <lb/>a mortification in the part, of which he dyed. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The next day after his death, I did open the body, <lb/>in preſence of Drs <hi
          rend="italic">Dawes</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Chamberlain</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
          >Woodward</hi>, Mr <hi rend="italic">Ber- <lb/>nard</hi> the Chirurgeon, and ſeveral
        others; in which the na- <lb/>tural Urinary Bladder was found lying on the left ſide of
        <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Peluis</hi> upon the <hi rend="italic">Ilium</hi> Bone, then
        ſearching what ſhould <lb/>be the cauſe of ſuch unnatural ſituation, we did find <lb/>one
        large and round bag, lying under the <hi rend="italic">Pubis</hi> upon <lb/>the <hi
          rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, filling up all the cavity of the <hi rend="italic"
          >Hypogaſter</hi>; <lb/>then in order to examine the thing more exactly, I did <lb/>diſſect
        the <hi rend="italic">Penis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rectum</hi>, and having taken
        them <lb/>out of the Body, and laid them down upon a Table, <lb/>the firſt thing I did was
        to lay open the <hi rend="italic">Urethra</hi>, to <lb/>examine whether there was any
        carnoſity, as the Sur- <lb/>geon who firſt introduced the Catheter had ſuſpected; <lb/>but
        there was none: and that <hi rend="italic">Ductus</hi> was as plain and <lb/>ſound as could
        be, except the dilaceration which the <pb n="754"/>
        <lb/>Catheter had made in it; then having introduced <lb/>a Conductor into the Bladder, I
        divided it <lb/>quite; and firſt it was obſerved, that the round <lb/>bag, which was made up
        of two Bladders, or rather <lb/>two Cyſtis's, divided one from the other only by a
        <lb/>Membrane, that which was next to the true Bladder <lb/>was ſomething bigger than the
        Bladder, the other <lb/>which was lying on the right ſide being much leſſer; <lb/>each of
        theſe two Cyſtis's had its orifice open in the neck <lb/>of the natural Bladder, which was
        longer than it is na- <lb/>turally, as you may ſee in the Figure. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>None of the <hi rend="italic">Ureteres</hi> were inſerted into any of theſe
        <lb/>Cyſtis's, but they were inſerted into the neck of the true <lb/>Bladder, by the
        orifices of the two Cyſtis's, inſomuch <lb/>that the Urine could be equally received by them
        and <lb/>the Bladder. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Secondly, It was obſerved that the glandules of the <lb/>true Bladder were
        extraordinarily big and red, that co- <lb/>lour being, very likely, the effect of the
        inflamation <lb/>cauſed by the dilaceration of the <hi rend="italic">Urethra</hi>. I have
        of- <lb/>tentimes obſerved that a thick <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi>, which runneth <lb/>out
        of the Bladder, and which ſome think to be the <lb/>matter of an Impoſtume or Ulcer in the
        Kidneys, is on- <lb/>ly produced by thoſe glandules of the Bladder grown <lb/>ſcrophulous,
        when that <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> groweth thick and <lb/>clammy, it cauſeth the ſame
        pain on the neck of the <lb/>Bladder as if it were a Stone. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The glandules of the great Cyſtis were very ſenſible, <lb/>but very ſmall, they were
        not at all ſenſible in the ſmal- <lb/>ler Cyſtis. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Now it is eaſie by the deſcription of theſe Bladders, <lb/>to give a reaſon of the
        ſymptoms that Gentleman did <lb/>undergo, for by the ſituation of the great Cyſtis, it is
        <lb/>plain the the Water could not come out but by the <lb/>force of the inſpiration, its
        own Muſcles being not able <lb/>to force it out, and conſequently could not come out <pb
          n="755"/>
        <lb/>but by little and little; and theſe efforts of inſpiration <lb/>were to be the greater
        when there was but little quan- <lb/>tity of Urine, becauſe it required greater force to
        make <lb/>it aſcend from the bottom of the Cyſtis, which could <lb/>not be done but with
        great labour and fatigue. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The pain which he did ſuffer in the late years of his <lb/>life, was cauſed by the
        thickneſs of the <hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> running <lb/>out of the glandules of his
        Bladder, his Kidneys being <lb/>very good and ſound. </p>
