        </note><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi> BEG leave to give you this trouble, and to <lb/>add ſome
        conjectures, which may be a kind <lb/>of addition to Dr. <hi rend="sc">cleghorn</hi>'s
        Account of this Iſland. <lb/>I live near the Glacis, and the artillery men are conſtantly
        <lb/>lodged in the ſquare within the caſtle. A little beyond <lb/>the ſquare is our
        hoſpital. My attendance at theſe two <lb/>places gives me no more than a ſalutary exerciſe.
        The <lb/>artificers in the civil branch of the ordnance, who are <lb/>under my care, live
        near me in the remains of the town <lb/>of St. Philip. I call them remains, becauſe many of
        the <lb/>houſes were deſtroyed during the late ſiege, and many <lb/>ſince; it being
        determined, that the town ſhall be re- <lb/>moved to a greater diſtance from the caſtle. A
        new ſpot <lb/>is accordingly marked out near Engliſh Cove, on the ſide <lb/>of the habour;
        and barracks for two regiments, together <lb/>with ſome houſes, are already built. The new
        as well <lb/>the old town are built in a very dry ſituation, on a ſolid <lb/>rock, on which
        there is not a drop of ſtagnating water <lb/>nor is there any near the ſurface of the earth;
        for the <lb/>water the inhabitants have for uſe, is either rain-water <pb n="440"/>
        <lb/>kept in ciſterns, or water drawn out of wells, from twenty <lb/>to ſixty or more feet
        in depth; nor are there any marſhes <lb/>near either town, or indeed in this part of the
        iſland. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The caſtle of St. Philip ſtands, or rather is cut of <lb/>the ſolid rock, on a
        promontory, two-thirds of which <lb/>are waſhed by the ſea, and is open to the ſea winds
        <lb/>from two-thirds of the compaſs. As there is no tide <lb/>there is no ſlimy ſhore, which
        might ſend forth putrid <lb/>vapours at low-water; and if there were a tide, our ſhore
        <lb/>is one continued rock, on which there is not any pu- <lb/>treſcent ſubſtance. Indeed
        the rocks are ſo free from <lb/>filth, that after a ſtrong wind has raiſed the ſea-water,
        <lb/>and carried it into cavities hollowed in the rock by ſtorms, <lb/>it drys there into
        pure white ſalt. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>During the hot weather in July, Auguſt, and Septem- <lb/>ber, our unhealthy ſeaſon, the
        air is daily ventilated, <lb/>either by general winds, which paſs freely over the iſland,
        <lb/>or by ſea-breezes. The air over the land being rarefied <lb/>by the reflected rays of
        the Sun, and by being in contact <lb/>with the heated earth, neceſſarily makes room for the
        <lb/>cooler and denſer air in contact with the cooler ſea-water. <lb/>Whence, in ſuch a
        ſituation, ſhall we ſeek for the cauſes <lb/>of <hi rend="italic">tertianas</hi>, ſo called
        here, and ſo much dreaded during <lb/>the hot months? Two cauſes ſeem to offer themselves;
        <lb/>one very obvious, the other rather more remote. The <lb/>Southerly winds are much
        complained of here, as occa- <lb/>ſioning a general laſſitude, and as bringing with them
        <lb/>noxious <hi rend="italic">effluvia</hi> from Africa; but whoever conſiders the <pb
          n="441"/>
        <lb/>diſtance between this iſland and Africa, will ſcarcely be- <lb/>lieve, that the air can
        carry with it, ſo far, any other qua- <lb/>lity than the warmth attending the ſeaſon of the
        year. <lb/>Gibraltar, nearer Africa, and more Southerly than we are, <lb/>is not ſubject to
          <hi rend="italic">tertians</hi>, nor are ſome places even in this <lb/>iſland. The cauſes
        therefore muſt be ſought for on the <lb/>ſpot. In a ſituation, ſuch as I have deſcribed ours
        to be, you <lb/>may believe, that ſhade and a plentiful ſupply of freſh <lb/>ſucculent
        culinary plants muſt be very deſirable. On ſo <lb/>dry a rock, an artificial ſupply of
        moiſture muſt become <lb/>neceſſary, eſpecially in a country where there ſeldom is <lb/>rain
        from May to October. It is not an eaſy matter to <lb/>keep a due mean in the uſe of whatever
        experience ſhews <lb/>to be neceſſary. If a little does good, we are apt to con- <lb/>clude,
        that a great deal will do more good: thus, I think, <lb/>it fares with us in regard to the
        uſe of water in our gar- <lb/>dens. In order to have a garden, it is neceſſary here to
        <lb/>have a draw-well. The drawing of water is the labour of <lb/>an aſs; and, as the labour
        is not hard, the beaſt is kept at <lb/>it pretty conſtantly, and thus plenty of water is
        drawn <lb/>up. As the water is hard, and is much colder than the <lb/>temperature of the
        air, it is kept in ciſterns for ſome time, <lb/>expoſed to the Sun, till it acquires the
        temperature of the <lb/>air, and thus becomes more friendly to vegetation than if <lb/>uſed
        immediately on being drawn up. Having thus ob- <lb/>tained plenty of water, they beſtow it
        moſt copiouſly on <lb/>their gardens. Suppoſe yourſelf landed at St. Philip's in <lb/>this
        ſeaſon of the year, on a dry, parched rock, and that <lb/>you were told, that the rock was
        uniformly the ſame all the <pb n="442"/>
        <lb/>way to Mahon, a diſtance of two miles, and that you <lb/>were under a neceſſity of
        going to Mahon in the <lb/>evening; would you expect to be ſerenaded on this rock <lb/>with
        the croacking of frogs all the way you went? This <lb/>literally is the caſe. The gardens on
        each ſide the road <lb/>are ſo much watered, that the frogs, bred in the ciſterns <lb/>which
        contain the water, ſpread and enjoy themſelves <lb/>around, and frequently take up their
        abode in trees. <lb/>This ſhews that even the trees abound much in watery <lb/>juices,
        ſeeing the exhalations ariſing from them yield <lb/>an atmoſphere agreeable to the frogs.
        Where land is <lb/>thus abundantly watered and cloſely planted with ſuc- <lb/>culent
        vegetables, many parts of theſe vegetables, as well <lb/>as the inſects which feed on them,
        will be liable to pu- <lb/>trify; and a putrid vapour may be thence exhaled in the
        <lb/>evening eſpecially, and during the night, when there <lb/>ſeldom is wind to carry them
        off. Whenever the inha- <lb/>bitants can find a proper depth of mould, within a con-
        <lb/>venient diſtance of a market, ſo many ſources of putrid <lb/>exhalations are formed. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Let me give an inſtance, to ſhew that this opinion is <lb/>not merely ideal. On the
        North-ſide of St. Philip's there <lb/>is a road, bounded on the North by a wall, called the
        <lb/>Line-wall: Dr. <hi rend="sc">huck</hi> muſt remember it and the envi- <lb/>rons. Along
        and near that wall there are many gardens, <lb/>which thus ſend forth unhealthy vapours; and
        the effect <lb/>is, that the houſes on the South-ſide of that road, though <lb/>facing the
        North, and thereby, one would think, the <lb/>healthier, are called Rotten-row, their
        unhealthineſs <pb n="443"/>
        <lb/>being owing, as is believed, to the vapours ariſing from <lb/>theſe gardens; for houſes
        ſituated on the South-ſide of <lb/>the town, though at a little diſtance, are by much the
        <lb/>more healthy, though more expoſed to the heat of the <lb/>meridian Sun. Other inſtances
        might be quoted; and <lb/>experience has taught us, that it is found to be very pre-
        <lb/>judicial to health to remain expoſed to the evening dews <lb/>near Mahon or St.
        Philips, round which theſe gardens <lb/>chiefly abound, while country peaſants lie in their
        vine- <lb/>yards whole nights without being hurt, the vines being <lb/>left to nature for a
        ſupply of moiſture. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Perhaps it may ſeem, that, while the heat and drought <lb/>of the climate makes this
        method of gardening neceſſary, <lb/>and at the ſame time require a large ſupply of ſucculent
        <lb/>vegetables and fruits, theſe ill conſequences muſt be un- <lb/>avoidable. But M. <hi
          rend="sc">de chateau-vieux</hi>, a magiſtrate of <lb/>Geneva, has pointed out a very
        promiſing remedy, ſug- <lb/>geſted to him by ſome of his own judicious experiments <lb/>in
        agriculture. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The ſecond general cauſe of <hi rend="italic">tertians</hi> was pointed out <lb/>to me
        by Dr. <hi rend="sc">munro</hi>, phyſician of this iſland, an inge- <lb/>nious gentleman,
        and very obſervant of every thing re- <lb/>lating to his profeſſion. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The rocks of this iſland conſiſt chiefly of two kinds <lb/>of ſtone; one ſo hard that
        ſcarce any tool can touch it; <lb/>and the other ſo ſoft, that it is eaſily cut into any
        form. <lb/>It much reſembles the Bath ſtone, and is called Cantoon <lb/>ſtone. The firſt is
        impervious to any fluid; but the other <lb/>ſucks up, or is penetrated by, moiſture, like
        filtering <pb n="444"/>
        <lb/>ſtones. I found, ſome years ago, this to be the caſe <lb/>with the Bath ſtone. Mr. <hi
          rend="sc">allen</hi> covered his workmen's <lb/>houſes with flat ſtones brought from the
        quarry, and cut <lb/>of a proper thickneſs: I mentioned to one of the inha- <lb/>bitants,
        that their houſes being ſo cloſely covered were, I <lb/>ſuppoſed, very warm; and was
        ſurprized at being told, <lb/>that they were much the reverſe; for that in rainy wea-
        <lb/>ther, the water penetrated through the ſtones; and that <lb/>in froſty weather, the
        inſide of the roofs were covered <lb/>with ice, whereby their upper rooms were of little uſe
        to <lb/>them. Theſe different qualities of the ſtones in this <lb/>iſland are not, perhaps,
        ſufficiently attended to. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When houſes are built on the hard rock, all within <lb/>the walls is levelled; and on
        that floor the poorer inha- <lb/>bitants live. As this ſtone takes a greater degree of cold
        <lb/>than ſubſtances leſs ſolid, and does not ſo ſoon come to <lb/>the temperature of the
        air; it conſequently cools, and <lb/>attracts to it the moiſture in the air, and retains it
        long on <lb/>its ſurface. In order to avoid the damp cold feel, if the <lb/>inhabitants can
        afford to buy a mat, they cover the floor <lb/>with it; under which the wet remaining,
        induces a <lb/>degree of putrefaction, which renders the houſes more <lb/>unhealthy, and
        reduces the inhabitants to a ſtate ready to <lb/>be affected by any diſtemper, eſpecially by
        the <hi rend="italic">tertian</hi>, <lb/>which ſpreads by contagion. As the moiſture remain-
        <lb/>ing on this ſtone is but temporary, provided there are <lb/>drains to carry the water
        off, its bad effects are eaſily pre- <lb/>vented by keeping a fire burning, or by laying the
        <lb/>ground-floor with terrace, or with deal-boards. </p>
      <pb n="445"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When houſes are built on the ſoft Cantoon ſtone, the <lb/>rain that falls without ſoaks
        through it; and if there are <lb/>no means of carrying it off, it remains in the ſtone, be-
        <lb/>comes putrid, gradually exhales, and thus becomes <lb/>highly prejudicial to health. I
        might quote ſeveral in- <lb/>ſtances of families dying in conſequence of ſuch putrid
        <lb/>moiſture; but ſhall reſt ſatisfied with one, beacauſe it <lb/>became an object of
        general obſervation. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>At a little diſtance from, and to the Northward of the <lb/>Line-wall, a lofty building
        was erected for a houſe of <lb/>entertainment. The people who inhabited it became <lb/>very
        unhealty; and in a few years ſo much ſo, that two <lb/>or three whole families died in it.
        This houſe, I am told, <lb/>is built on Cantoon ſtone, the hollows filled with Can-
        <lb/>toon rubbiſh, and is ſurrounded by gardens continually <lb/>watered, ſome of which are
        higher than the floor of this <lb/>building; by which means the ſtone became the receptacle
        <lb/>of the waſte water. In order to remedy this inconveniency, <lb/>the floor was taken up,
        and a ſtench aroſe which the <lb/>workmen could ſcarcely bear, and changed the colour of
        <lb/>every metallic ſubſtance about them. People were im- <lb/>preſſed with ſo ſtrong a
        prejudice againſt the houſe, that <lb/>it remains uninhabited and an uſeleſs building. The
        <lb/>ſame has happened in other dwelling-houſes; in which <lb/>the ſame ſtench, and other
        indications of putrefaction, <lb/>were met with, as in the former caſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I can yet, thank God, ſay very little of the diſeaſe of <lb/>this country, for we ſtill
        continue very healthy. I have <lb/>met with two inſtances of how faſt a hold<hi
          rend="italic"> tertians</hi> take <pb n="446"/>
        <lb/>of the conſtitution, when the patients have been ſubject <lb/>to frequent relapſes. Dr.
          <hi rend="sc">munro</hi> tells me, that an addi- <lb/>tion of <hi rend="italic">Myrrh</hi>
        ʒij. to <hi rend="italic">Cort. Peru.</hi> ℥j. is the beſt medicine <lb/>he knows in this
        caſe. I have tried it in both, with ſeem- <lb/>ing ſucceſs; for we can ſay nothing certain
        on that head <lb/>till the winter. One of them was much afflicted with <lb/>pains in the
        lower part of the belly, even after the fever <lb/>had left him. I gave him <hi
          rend="italic">Calomel.</hi> gr. vi. <hi rend="italic">Pulv.</hi>
        <hi rend="italic">Rhei</hi>
        <lb/>gr. xv. in a bolus, and repeated it, at proper intervals, <lb/>four times. He thinks
        his preſent health is much owing <lb/>to it; as does my other patient from the ſame
        medicine. <lb/>I have found <hi rend="italic">calomel</hi> peculiarly beneficial to ſeveral
        chil- <lb/>dren who had periodical heats on them, eſpecially at <lb/>night. </p>
