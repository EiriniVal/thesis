        foregoing Letter. By Mr. <hi rend="roman">William <lb/>Beckett</hi>, Surgeon, F. R. S. </head>
      <p rend="space">
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>HE remarkable Difference in the Stature of hu- <lb/>man Bodies,
        in the Space of a few Hours time, <lb/>taken Notice of in the Reverend Mr. <hi rend="italic"
          >Waſſe</hi>'s Letter, <lb/>read before the Society this Day Sevennight, I have <lb/>ſince
        found to be Fact, by ſeveral Experiments made <lb/>with the greateſt exactneſs I have been
        capable of. <lb/>Only this I have farther obſerved, that in thoſe Per- <lb/>ſons who have
        been young, the Alteration has been <lb/>more conſiderable than in thoſe that have been
        aged. <lb/>The Trials equally ſucceeding in a ſitting as in a <lb/>ſtanding Poſture, will
        naturally lead us to believe, that <lb/>it muſt neceſſarily be from the Trunk of the Body,
        or <lb/>ſome of its Parts, that this remarkable Alteration is <lb/>brought about. Now every
        Body knows, that the <lb/>Standard of a Perſon's Stature has been always look- <lb/>ed upon
        to be determined by the whole <hi rend="italic">Compages</hi> of <lb/>the Bones, adjuſted by
        the Divine Architect according <lb/>to the ſtricteſt Rules of Geometry. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>But there is ſomething ſo wonderful in the Structure <lb/>and Diſpoſition of the Spine,
        that nothing but ſuch a <lb/>peculiar Contrivance could ſo curiouſly have fitted it for
        <lb/>the reſpective Uſes and Purpoſes it was ordained for. <lb/>The thickneſs and ſhortneſs
        of the Bones, with the <lb/>intervening Cartilages, aſſiſted by the bony Proceſſes,
        <lb/>diſpoſe it to a Motion peculiar to it ſelf. Whereas had <lb/>the Bones been of any
        conſiderable length, upon bend- <lb/>ing the Body, the Articulations muſt have made a large
        <lb/>Angle upon their inmoſt Edges, and the ſpinal Mar- <pb n="90"/>
        <lb/>row have been continually liable to be injured; or <lb/>had the Cartilages been
        entirely wanting, it would <lb/>have been as uſeleſs as if it were but one Bone, where-
        <lb/>by we being rendered uncapable of bending the Trunk <lb/>of the Body, it muſt have
        always remained in an erect <lb/>Poſture. But by the preſent Diſpoſition of its Parts,
        <lb/>'tis not only abſolutely ſecured againſt any ſuch In- <lb/>conveniences, but, although
        ſo ſmall a Pillar as it is, <lb/>is capable of ſupporting, without Hazard, ſuch pro-
        <lb/>digious Weights, as we are not wanting in our Ac- <lb/>counts of. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Another Particular, which beſpeaks the utmoſt Wiſ- <lb/>dom and Deſign in the
        Contrivance of this Part, is the <lb/>remarkable Difference there is in the thickneſs of the
        <lb/>Cartilages, placed betwixt the Bones of the Spine; the <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Vertebræ</hi> of the Breaſt requiring but little Motion, <lb/>the Cartilages are there
        but thin, in compariſon of <lb/>thoſe of the Loins, which being very thick, the low-
        <lb/>eſt more eſpecially, the Motions is there vaſtly greater; <lb/>and the Cartilages being
        abundantly thicker before <lb/>than behind, this is the Reaſon that we bend our <lb/>Bodies
        ſo much more forward than backward. And <lb/>by this admirable Method of diſpoſing of the
        thicker <lb/>Parts of the Cartilages forward, it is, that in all vio- <lb/>lent Exerciſes,
        the Parts contained in the Belly and <lb/>Breaſt are in a great meaſure ſecured from any Da-
        <lb/>mages they might have been liable to, becauſe by the <lb/>pliableneſs and elaſticity of
        theſe Cartilages, they <lb/>break the violent Shocks the <hi rend="italic">Viſcera</hi> muſt
        otherwiſe <lb/>have neceſſarily ſuſtain'd upon ſuch Occaſions. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>From what I have here remarked, in relation to <lb/>theſe peculiar Properties of the
        Cartilages placed be- <lb/>tween the Bones of the Spine, we may reaſonably ſup- <lb/>poſe
        them to be certain compreſſible, dilatable, ela- <lb/>ſtick Bodies, which like other Bodies,
        endued with <pb n="91"/>
        <lb/>the ſame Qualities, will naturally yield to any incum- <lb/>bent Weight, which is
        ſufficient to force the Particles <lb/>of Matter of which they conſiſt, into a more ſtrict
        <lb/>and cloſe Union, and that when this compreſſive <lb/>Power is removed, they will of
        themſelves recover <lb/>that State they enjoyed before they were obli- <lb/>ged to give Way
        to that Preſſure. Now I am <lb/>here particularly to obſerve, that the loweſt of all the
        <lb/>Cartilages of the Loins, is the thickeſt, and ſo conſe- <lb/>quently that it contains a
        greater Quantity of Matter <lb/>than any of the reſt; by which means it becomes more
        <lb/>diſpoſed to have its thickneſs diminiſhed, and that all <lb/>of them gradually become
        thinner, even to the top of <lb/>the Spine. Now all ſuperiour Bodies, if they come to
        <lb/>an immediate Contact, preſſing upon their inferiour, it <lb/>muſt neceſſarily follow,
        that the whole Weight of the <lb/>Body, except the lower Limbs, muſt preſs upon and <lb/>be
        ſuſtained by the loweſt <hi rend="italic">Vertebræ</hi> and their Carti- <lb/>lages; but
        theſe Cartilages, as has been obſerved, be- <lb/>ing much thicker in this Part than the
        other, and the <lb/>incumbent Wight bearing harder upon them, they <lb/>muſt be unavoidably
        compreſs'd more than the other; <lb/>and ſo, conſequently, when this Weight is removed,
        <lb/>their Expanſion, from their natural Elaſticity, will be <lb/>greater alſo. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This being the natural State and Diſpoſition of theſe <lb/>Parts, during the whole
        ſpace of Time we are uſually <lb/>employed about our neceſſary Avocations till we diſ-
        <lb/>poſe our ſelves to Reſt, the Cartilages of the Spine <lb/>will, by their compreſſible
        and yielding Properties, be- <lb/>come more cloſe and compact from the perpendicular
        <lb/>Preſſure they ſuſtain, and ſo conſequently the Spine, <lb/>the only ſupport of the
        Trunk of the Body, will become <lb/>ſhorter. But when this ſuperiour Weight ſhall be entire-
        <lb/>ly removed, by placing the Body in a horizontal Po- <pb n="92"/>
        <lb/>ſture, as it always is when we are in Bed, the compreſs'd <lb/>Cartilages will, by
        their natural elaſtick Power, begin <lb/>gradually to enlarge themſelves, till they recover
        the <lb/>ſame expanded State they enjoyed before they were <lb/>forced to give Way, and
        yield to the incumbent Preſ- <lb/>ſure; and ſo conſequently it will produce a conſidera-
        <lb/>ble Alteration in a Perſon's Stature, agreeable to the <lb/>determined Times mentioned
        in the preceding Letter. <lb/>For if we only conſider, that the before-mentioned
        <lb/>compreſſive Power will leſſen the thickneſs of all the <lb/>Cartilages, in proportion
        to the Quantity of Matter <lb/>they contain; and that there are uſually reckoned about
        <lb/>twenty four in Number, it will be no difficult Matter <lb/>for us to apprehend, that
        their natural Expanſion be- <lb/>ing recovered by our cuſtomary Repoſe, the Aggregate
        <lb/>of the whole of the Expanſions may amount to <lb/>about an Inch. Now if the Alteration
        be ſo con- <lb/>ſiderable as this, occaſioned only by the bare incum- <lb/>bent Weight of
        the ſuperiour Parts of the Body, with- <lb/>out any additional Force applied to compreſs the
        Car- <lb/>tilages yet cloſer, how much more may we reaſonably <lb/>imagine it would be, were
        the Experiment tried on <lb/>ſuch Perſons, whoſe uſual Employment it is to carry <lb/>heavy
        Burthens. I have only this one Particular far- <lb/>ther to obſerve upon this Head, which
        is, that this <lb/>Alteration is not to be expected to be the ſame in aged <lb/>Perſons as
        in thoſe that are younger, becauſe the Car- <lb/>tilages, as we advance in Years, gradually
        grow har- <lb/>der and harder, till many of them arrive to the ſoli- <lb/>dity of a Bone;
        that is, by Degrees they loſe their <lb/>Spring of expanſive Power, and at length continue
        in <lb/>a compreſs'd State of Reſt. And this is without doubt <lb/>one principal Cauſe, why
        old People not only ſeem to <lb/>have loſt ſomewhat of their former Height, but are
        <lb/>actually ſhorter. </p>
