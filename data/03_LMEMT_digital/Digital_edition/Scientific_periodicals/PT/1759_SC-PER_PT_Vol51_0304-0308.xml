        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Thomas Bingham, a very healthy young man, 20 <lb/>years old, came from Yarmouth to
          London, in Sep- <lb/>tember 1759, and put himſelf under my care, to be <lb/>cured of a
          ſwelling, which he had in his urethra. <lb/>Upon queſtioning the patient, I was informed
          by <lb/>him, that he had little or no pain; that he had never <lb/>perceived the leaſt
          difficulty in voiding his urine, nor <lb/>had he ever had the leaſt involuntary efflux of
          it: he <lb/>had not at any time ſuffered in the leaſt but from <lb/>the bulk and weight of
          ſomething that grew in his <lb/>urinary paſſage (urethra), which, upon exerciſe of
          <lb/>late, proved troubleſome to him. Upon inſpection, <lb/>I diſcovered a conſiderable
          prominence betwixt the <lb/>teſticles and anus. Upon feeling the part with my
          <lb/>fingers, there appeared a very evident hardneſs and <lb/>tumor. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>By introducing a large, ſmooth, and ductile, probe <lb/>into the urethra, it was
          evident there was a ſtone or <lb/>ſtones lodged in that paſſage. I adviſed the cutting
          <lb/>the tumor out, which was complied with; and in the <lb/>following manner I proceeded
          to the performance of <lb/>the operation. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The patient being ſupinely placed upon a ſteady <lb/>table, of a convenient height,
          covered with a double <lb/>blanket, and a pillow put under his ſhoulders, I <lb/>cauſed
          his hands and feet to be tied together; and, by <lb/>proper aſſiſtants, he was held in the
          ſame poſition as <pb n="306"/>
          <lb/>is done in the operation of cutting for the ſtone in the <lb/>urinary bladder. I then
          proceeded to divide the ure- <lb/>thra longitudinally by inciſion. The extent of the
          <lb/>inciſion was from one end of the ſwelling to the <lb/>other: the lenght and ſize of
          the wound enabled me <lb/>to take away the ſtones without any violence or diffi-
          <lb/>culty. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>After the ſtones were removed, I brought the lips <lb/>of the wound together, and,
          with the twiſted ſuture, <lb/>I retained them in that ſituation. By this method, <lb/>and
          by occaſionally paſſing a bougie of a proper ſize <lb/>into the urethra, beyond the
          farther extent of the in- <lb/>ciſion, the patient went happily on, till the cure of the
          <lb/>wound was completed, which was effected in about <lb/>three weeks; and there
          afterwards remained no incon- <lb/>venience at all to the patient in voiding or retaining
          <lb/>his urine. </p>
        <p rend="hangin space">
          <lb/><hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> As the identical calculi are preſented to the
          <lb/>Fellows of the Royal Society for their inſpection, <lb/>ſo that the exact ſizes,

          <lb/>unneceſſary to give a written account of theſe par- <lb/>ticulars. However, as it may
          probably give ſome <lb/>ſatisfaction to the curious to be informed of the ſpe- <lb/>cific
          gravities of theſe ſtones, I have ſubjoined <lb/>theſe particulars to this memoir, and
          have like- <lb/>wiſe, for the ſame reaſon, cauſed an engraving of <lb/>theſe ſtones to be

          <lb/><hi rend="italic">Quære.</hi> Is it not probable, that the generation of <lb/>theſe
          ſtones might originally have begun in the ure- <lb/>thra, as the patient did not ever
          remember to have <lb/>had the leaſt complaint in his loins, or in any part of <lb/>his
          bladder? Or is it more reaſonable to ſuppoſe, <lb/>that the ſtones were firſt of all
          formed in the kidney, <lb/>or urinary bladder, from thence conveyed with the <lb/>ſtream
          of urine, when very ſmall, and lodged in the <lb/>urethra, till they had arrived to theſe
          ſizes? </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Either of theſe ſuppoſitions to me appears reaſon- <lb/>able. </p>

          <lb/>However, as hypotheſes of this kind are with dif- <lb/>ficulty aſcertained, and as a
          diſcovery of the fact, <lb/>could it be determinately made, would prove of very
          <lb/>little conſequence to the improvement of the art of <lb/>ſurgery, I think it quite
          unneceſſary to dwell upon a <lb/>part of this ſubject, in which the benefit of mankind
