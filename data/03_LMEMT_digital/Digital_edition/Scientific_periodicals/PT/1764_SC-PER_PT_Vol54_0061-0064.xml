        </note><hi rend="dc(2)">A</hi> Healthy boy, about ſix years old, <lb/>was ſuddenly ſeized
        with a moſt <lb/>acute pain, at the bottom of his belly; during <lb/>the time the pain
        laſted he could not diſcharge <lb/>a drop of urine, tho' he frequently endeavoured.
        <lb/>After about an hour and half, he became perfectly <lb/>eaſy on a ſudden, and piſſed
        very freely. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>A few days after this, a ſmall tumor, about the <lb/>ſize of a large pea, was
        diſcovered, in the upper part <lb/>of the ſpermatic proceſs, juſt below the groin. As this
        <lb/>tumor was perfectly indolent, and gave the child no <lb/>kind of uneaſineſs, no notice
        was taken of it. By <lb/>ſlow degrees it deſcended lower and lower; and as <lb/>it deſcended
        it ſeemed to increaſe in ſize: the boy <lb/>was obſerved to make water oftener than uſual,
        but <lb/>without pain or difficulty. He was looked at by <lb/>two or three practitioners in
        the country, who, not <lb/>knowing what to make of it, adviſed the letting it <lb/>alone; at
        laſt, in the ſpace of five years, it got to the <lb/>lower part of the ſcrotum; and, after
        it was got thi- <lb/>ther, it was obſerved to increaſe in ſize much faſter <lb/>than it had
        done before. The boy was at a great diſt- <lb/>ance from London, and his friends could ill
        bear the <lb/>expence of going thither with him; ſo that another <lb/>year paſſed away after
        the tumor was got into the <lb/>laſt-mentioned ſituation. At laſt when he was about <pb
          n="62"/>
        <lb/>thirteen years old, the ſwelling becoming troubleſome, <lb/>and the people in the
        country not caring to meddle <lb/>with it, he was brought to London. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Two or three gentlemen of the profeſſion, to <lb/>whom he was ſhowed, took it for a
        ſchirrhous teſti- <lb/>cle, and adviſed the extirpation of it; to which the <lb/>child's
        friends would not conſent. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When he was brought to me, I examined him <lb/>very carefully, and was ſatisfied that
        the tumor, <lb/>(which was now about as big as a middling cheſ- <lb/>nut) was not formed by
        the teſticle: but, though <lb/>I was clear that it was not formed by that gland, <lb/>yet I
        could not find any teſtis on that ſide. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The ſwelling was ſtill perfectly void of pain; had <lb/>a ſtony, incompreſſible,
        hardneſs; was troubleſome <lb/>to the child when at play or uſing any briſk exerciſe,
        <lb/>but never gave him any uneaſineſs when he ſat, or <lb/>ſtood ſtill. It had all the
        appearance of being de- <lb/>pendent from the ſpermatic proceſs; but the pro- <lb/>ceſs,
        tho' it had neither the look nor the feel of being <lb/>diſeaſed, was yet too large, and too
        full for a child of <lb/>that age, and larger and fuller than that of the other <lb/>ſide.
        The perfect equality and ſmoothneſs of the <lb/>tumor, its extreme, incompreſſibility and
        its being per- <lb/>fectly free from pain, even when preſſed with ſome <lb/>force, were the
        circumſtances which induced me to <lb/>believe that it was not the teſticle; but, tho' I was
        <lb/>in my own mind ſatisfied of that, yet I cannot ſay <lb/>that I was by any means clear
        what it was; and all <lb/>that I could determine, was, that it certainly ought <lb/>to be
        removed; as well on account of the trou- <lb/>ble it now gave, and its manifeſt diſpoſition
        to <pb n="63"/>
        <lb/>increaſe, as that I could not foreſee any great haz- <lb/>ard that was likely to attend
        its extirpation. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>From the uncertainty in which I was concerning <lb/>the true nature of the caſe, I
        determined to act very <lb/>cautiouſly. I made an inciſion thro' the ſkin and cel-
        <lb/>lular membrane, from the upper part of the ſcrotum <lb/>quite down to the lower; by
        which I diſcovered a <lb/>firm, ſtrong, white membraneous ciſt, or bag, con- <lb/>nected
        looſely with the ſkin by means of the dartos; <lb/>I diſſected all the anterior part of this
        ciſt, quite <lb/>clean; and found, that, as I traced it upward, it be- <lb/>came narrower,
        and ſeemed to proceed from the groin: <lb/>This determined me to try if I could not free the
        <lb/>poſterior part of it alſo. In doing this I diſcovered <lb/>the teſticle, which was much
        compreſſed, flat, <lb/>very ſmall, and lay immediately behind the tu- <lb/>mor. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The diſſection of the teſticle and of the ſpermatic <lb/>chord from the bag, and from
        its neck (which I <lb/>was obliged to do in order to preſerve the teſtis) <lb/>took up ſome
        time, and gave me ſome trouble; but, <lb/>when I had finiſhed it, I found that the ciſt was
        de- <lb/>pendent from, or continuous with, a membranous <lb/>tube, or duct, of about the
        breadth of a large wheat <lb/>ſtraw, which ſeemed to paſs out from the abdomen, <lb/>thro'
        the opening in the oblique muſcle, along with <lb/>the ſpermatic veſſels. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When I had perfectly freed this duct from all con- <lb/>nexion, I cut it thro'
        immediately above the tumor; <lb/>upon the diviſion of it a quantity of limpid fluid
        <lb/>(not leſs than two ounces) followed, and the mouth <lb/>of the ciſt expanding itſelf
        diſcovered a large ſtone, <lb/>exactly reſembling the calculi found in the urinary <pb
          n="64"/>
        <lb/>bladder; which ſtone was cloſely embraced by the <lb/>ſaid ciſt. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As there was not the leaſt appearance of any fluid <lb/>either in the bag or duct,
        before it was cut off, this <lb/>diſcharge, together with the ſtone, induced me to ſuſ-
        <lb/>pect that the caſe was a Hernia ciſtica. In order to <lb/>be certain, I ſtaid ſome
        time; and, when I thought it <lb/>was probable that ſome urine was derived into the
        <lb/>bladder, I deſired the boy to make water; he en- <lb/>deavoured ſo to do, and a full
        ſtream of urine flowed <lb/>out through the wound in the groin, which put the <lb/>caſe
        beyond all doubt. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I dreſſed him ſuperficially; he had no bad <lb/>ſymptom; his urine all paſſed out by
        his wound for a <lb/>fortnight, or twenty days; at the end of which <lb/>time, the wound
        gradually contracted; all the urine <lb/>came through the urethra; and at the end of a month
        <lb/>he was perfectly well. </p>
