        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">M</hi>R. <hi rend="italic">La Grange</hi>, aged about 50, of a ſallow
        bi- <lb/>lious Complexion, died of an Abſceſs in the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Veſica
          Fellis</hi>, the 29th of <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 1733. Dr. <hi rend="italic"
        >Vatas</hi>, his <pb n="318"/>
        <lb/>Phyſician in Ordinary, reports, That about 14 Years <lb/>before, this Gentleman was
        afflicted with a Tertian <lb/>Ague, which was cured by the Bark, and from that <lb/>Time had
        complain'd of a Senſe of Weight, and ſome <lb/>Uneaſineſs and Hardneſs in the Region of the
        Liver <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">Borborygmi</hi>, which were reliev'd by frequent Pur-
        <lb/>gations; notwithſtanding which, he had enjoy'd all the <lb/>Appearances of Health, till
        about four Months before <lb/>his Death, when ſome Symptoms of the Jaundice firſt <lb/>began
        to appear on him, which had greatly increas'd <lb/>five or ſix Weeks before he died, when he
        began to <lb/>complain of ſhooting Pains on the Right Hypochon- <lb/>der, which was ſoon
        follow'd with a hard inflamma- <lb/>tory Tumour there, tending to Suppuration. The <lb/>4th
        of <hi rend="italic">May</hi>, I met Dr. <hi rend="italic">Vatas</hi>, and Mr. <hi
          rend="italic">Fiquel</hi>, his <lb/>Surgeon, in order to open a large Abſceſs pointing
        <lb/>below the Cartilages of the ſecond and third ſpurious <lb/>Ribs on the Right Side.
        'Twas determin'd to open it <lb/>immediately with a Lancet, whereupon a Pint of a
        <lb/>purulent fetid Matter was diſcharg'd. The Aperture <lb/>being large, and the Dreſſings
        eaſy, by the next Day <lb/>we found, that a very large Quantity of <hi rend="italic"
          >Sanies</hi>, and <lb/>ſome <hi rend="italic">Pus</hi> left in the Bag, had found a Vent;
        and this <lb/>was ſo great, that 'twas thought proper to renew the <lb/>Dreſſings twice a
        Day. This had the deſired Effect ſo <lb/>far, that from this Time the Matter daily decreas'd
        till <lb/>the 12th of <hi rend="italic">May</hi>, when we were inform'd, that during
        <lb/>the Night the Wound had diſcharg'd near two Quarts <lb/>of Matter of a ſaffron Colour,
        intermix'd with large <lb/>Flakes and thick Lumps of a coagulated Lymph or <lb/>Jelly,
        tinged of a deep Yellow; and what ſurpriz'd us <lb/>no leſs, was, that upon Dreſſing we made
        way for the <lb/>Diſcharge of about a Quart more of the ſame, as we <pb n="319"/>
        <lb/>inlarg'd the Orifice of the burſted Bag, to favour the <lb/>coming out of the large
        Flakes and Lumps of Jelly ob- <lb/>turating at times this Orifice. During this Day the
        <lb/>Diſcharge was exceeding great, and at Night was <lb/>emptied about a Pint more of the
        ſame Matter. From <lb/>this Time a ſhort and thick <hi rend="italic">Canula</hi> was left in
        the <lb/>Opening of the burſted Bag, this cauſing a more eaſy <lb/>and conſtant Diſcharge,
        and a vulnerary Injection, <lb/>ſtrongly ſaturated with Spirit of Wine, had the good
        <lb/>Effect to diminiſh it very conſiderably; but yet it con- <lb/>tinued ſo very great,
        that we had juſt Reaſon to appre- <lb/>hend our Patient would ſoon ſink under ſo great a
        Flux <lb/>of this bilious Matter, and the rather that his Stomach <lb/>and his Reſt fail'd
        him; but the Diſcharge daily leſſen- <lb/>ing, and his Appetite and Reſt returning in
        Propor- <lb/>tion, he recover'd Strength enough to be able to <lb/>walk. All this while the
        Appearances of the Jaundice <lb/>were wearing of, the Urine was return'd to its natural
        <lb/>Colour, and the Patient had regularly a natural Stool <lb/>every Day, till about eight
        Days before his Death, when <lb/>his Body becoming coſtive, the Phyſician found it ne-
        <lb/>ceſſary to diſcharge the <hi rend="italic">Feces</hi>, by Clyſters and lenient
        <lb/>Purges. Whilſt I attended him, his Belly was <lb/>always free from Fulneſs or Tenſion,
        being ſoft <lb/>and lank, and he leſs troubled with Wind, than he had <lb/>been for many
        Years before. Two Days before he <lb/>died, he went to air himſelf in another Room, and
        <lb/>caught Cold: This is preſum'd to have occaſion'd a Fe- <lb/>ver follow'd with a
        Lethargy, in which he continued <lb/>till the 29th of <hi rend="italic">May</hi>, when he
        died. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr. <hi rend="italic">Stuart</hi> and Dr. <hi rend="italic">Vatas</hi>, Mr. <hi
          rend="italic">Fiquel</hi>, myſelf, <lb/>and ſeveral more, attended the Diſſection, when
        'twas <lb/>obſerv'd, that our Patient was not nearly ſo exte- <pb n="320"/>
        <lb/>nuated as might have been expected, after ſo great a <lb/>Diſcharge of Bile and Lymph
        during 25 Days; for <lb/>much Fat was yet obſerv'd under the Skin and elſe- <lb/>where, and
        his Fleſh not much ſunk from the natural <lb/>State, but the Blood-Veſſels were found
        extremely <lb/>empty. The <hi rend="italic">Abdomen</hi> being open'd, the Caul or <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Omentum</hi> was ſhrivel'd up, and adhered to a great Bag <lb/>or <hi
          rend="italic">Cyſtis</hi>, affixed to the Inſide of the great Lobe of the <lb/>Liver, and
        ſtretching from thence along the Right <lb/>Flank, over one half of the Kidney on that Side.
        The <lb/>Left Lobe of the Liver was remov'd from the Left Side <lb/>to the Right, not
        reaching farther than the Right Edge <lb/>of the <hi rend="italic">Cartilago
        Enſiformis</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi>: The <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Ligamentum latum Suſpenſorium hepatis</hi>, was drawn <lb/>backwards into the Right
        Hypochonder. The Liver <lb/>was of a natural Colour, but very ſmall, and more <lb/>decay'd
        and waſted in Proportion that the other <hi rend="italic">Viſ- <lb/>cera</hi>, but as free
        as they from any preternatural Ad- <lb/>heſion, Obſtruction, or Induration, and the Bag or
          <lb/><hi rend="italic">Cyſtis</hi> ariſing from it, ſtrongly adhering by its Outſide
        <lb/>only, to the <hi rend="italic">Peritoneum</hi>, down to the Right Kidney. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Upon paſſing my Finger through the Wound in the <lb/>Integuments, it enter'd firſt into
        a Cavity made between <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Peritoneum</hi> and the Outſide of the <hi
          rend="italic">Cyſtis</hi>, in which <lb/>the Matter of the Abſceſs had been lodged, and
        then <lb/>through a Hole in the <hi rend="italic">Cyſtis</hi>, or grand Bag, through
        <lb/>which the great Collection of Bile in this <hi rend="italic">Saccus</hi> had
        <lb/>afterwards made its way; and 'twas obſerv'd, that the <lb/>ſtrong Coalition of this Bag
        to the <hi rend="italic">Peritoneum</hi> round <lb/>that Part where the <hi rend="italic"
          >Pus</hi> had been collected, had ſhut <lb/>up all Communication with the Cavity of the
        Belly, <lb/>and thereby prevented any Extravaſation into the <hi rend="italic">Ab-
          <lb/>domen</hi>. </p>
      <pb n="321"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Now the Bag or Cyſtis being ſeparated from the <hi rend="italic">Pe-
        <lb/>ritoneum</hi>, and this and the Liver ſpread on a Board, 'twas <lb/>obſerv'd that the
        Matter had been collected in the Gall- <lb/>Bladder, without affecting the Liver itſelf. The
          <hi rend="italic">Veſica <lb/>Fellis</hi> was become a very large Bladder, and extended
        <lb/>ſo as then to appear capable of containing three Pints, <lb/>or more; 'twas nearly as
        broad as long: It aroſe very <lb/>broad from the inner Surface of the Right Lobe of the
        <lb/>Liver, which it occupied about 10 Inches in Circum- <lb/>ference, or more: Its Bulk had
        remov'd the Stomach <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">Pylorus</hi> from their natural Situations,
        and preſs'd <lb/>them far under the Left Hypochonder, and that Part <lb/>of the <hi
          rend="italic">Colon</hi> placed naturally on the Right Kidney, <lb/>forwards upon the
        Spine: Its Surfaces were rugged <lb/>and unequal, as that of a <hi rend="italic"
        >Potato</hi>, and its Coats thick <lb/>and horny, forming ſeveral Tumours, Elongations or
        <lb/>Expanſions, of different Sizes and Figures; one of <lb/>which, as large as a Hen's Egg,
        was full of a cretaceous <lb/>Matter, intermix'd with hard white Stones. This cre-
        <lb/>taceous Bag was made in the Duplicature of the <hi rend="italic">Veſica
          <lb/>Fellis</hi>, but had no Communication with nor Opening <lb/>into it, which ſeveral
        other Tumours appearing of the <lb/>ſame Kind, had; whence 'twas preſum'd that ſome
        <lb/>very ſmall Pieces of <hi rend="italic">Creta</hi>, found in the great Bag, <lb/>might
        have dropt from them into it, but 'tis more <lb/>likely we had dropt them there, becauſe
        nothing like <lb/>them had been diſcharg'd through the Wound. The <lb/>outward Opening in
        this Bag anſwer'd in the Cavity <lb/>of the Abſceſs, wherein Inciſion had been made, as
        <lb/>this latter was form'd between it and the <hi rend="italic">Peritoneum</hi>. <lb/>In
        the Bag were found about two Ounces of the ſame <lb/>bilious Matter which had all along been
        diſcharg'd; <lb/>which being computed, muſt be equal to, if not exceed, <pb n="322"/>
        <lb/>the Quantity of 18 or 20 Quarts, during the 25 Days <lb/>the Patient lived, from and
        after the opening of the <lb/>Tumour. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It has been obſerv'd, that the Liver was in a natural <lb/>State, and that the Matter
        collected in the <hi rend="italic">Veſica Fellis</hi>
        <lb/>had not in the leaſt wounded or affected the Liver itſelf; <lb/>ſo that the great
        Quantity of Bile and Lymph daily diſ- <lb/>charg'd through the Inciſion, muſt have proceeded
        from <lb/>the internal Surface of the diſtended Gall-Bladder. <lb/>This put us upon
        inquiring for the <hi rend="italic">Radices Cyſticæ</hi> and <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Hepati-cyſtic</hi> Ducts; I mean for thoſe very Ducts which <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Giovanni Caldeſi</hi> has ſo carefully traced in ſeveral <lb/>Animals, and delineated in
        his <hi rend="italic">Obſervatione Anato- <lb/>miche al illuſtriſſimo Sig. Franciſco Redi
          1687.</hi> and <lb/>which <hi rend="italic">Verheyen</hi> has diſcover'd in the <hi
          rend="italic">Bullock</hi> Kind, <lb/>but could not trace in Man; These Ducts, I ſay,
        <lb/>whereby ſo great a Quantity of Gall had been depo- <lb/>ſited in the <hi rend="italic"
          >Veſica Fellis</hi>, for as much that the Cyſtick <lb/>Duct was obturated, whereby ſome
        Anatomiſts have <lb/>ſuppos'd the Gall to flow back from the Hepatick <lb/>Ducts; and upon
        Diſſection, we traced a Trunk like <lb/>unto that, which <hi rend="italic">Bidloo</hi> and
          <hi rend="italic">Winſlow</hi> obſerved in Man; <lb/>and reſembling that form'd by ſeveral
        Branches in the <lb/>Liver, and diſcharging itſelf into the <hi rend="italic">Veſica</hi>.
        We <lb/>would gladly have traced this further, but the Time <lb/>allow'd for Diſſection did
        not permit us to purſue this <lb/>Inquiry. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Ductus Communis Choledochus</hi> was found <lb/>empty, and
        opening, as uſual, into the Cavity of the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Duodenum</hi>; but the
        Cyſtick Duct was ſo compreſs'd <lb/>by the Bag, that nothing could paſs through it. The
        <lb/>Spleen, <hi rend="italic">Pancreas</hi>, and all the other <hi rend="italic"
          >Viſcera</hi>, were in a <lb/>natural State, ſaving (as hath been already obſerved) <pb
          n="323"/>
        <lb/>that ſome of them had changed and altered their natural <lb/>Situations. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Upon the whole it appears, <hi rend="italic">1ſt</hi>, That the animal <lb/>Functions
        have been in no-wiſe vitiated by ſome of the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Viſcera</hi> having been
        diſplaced; and notwithſtanding <lb/>that for 25 Days, the Diſcharge of the Bile through
        <lb/>the Wound had been ſo great, that little was left to <lb/>paſs into the <hi
          rend="italic">Duodenum</hi>, nevertheleſs he digeſted his <lb/>Food well. The Stools
        continued regular, till within <lb/>a few Days before Death, and even to the laſt the
        <lb/>Feces all along retain'd their natural Colour. <hi rend="italic">2dly</hi>, <lb/>It may
        be obſev'd, that the Jaundice in our Patient <lb/>was not occaſion'd by the Obſtruction of
        the Cyſtick <lb/>Duct, though that is apprehended as a common Cauſe <lb/>of this Malady; for
        this Obſtruction muſt have been <lb/>of many Years ſtanding, and our Patient's Jaundice
        <lb/>was of a very late Date. Now was his Jaundice owing <lb/>to any Retention of the Bile
        in the <hi rend="italic">Porus Biliarius</hi>, <lb/>from the Tumour continually preſſing
        that Duct, and <lb/>thereby obſtructing the free Diſcharge of the Bile from <lb/>the Glands
        of the Liver into the <hi rend="italic">Duodenum</hi> and Gall- <lb/>Bladder; nor even to
        the ſtrong Compreſſion and total <lb/>Obſtruction of ſome, yea almoſt all the Biliary Ducts,
          <lb/><hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Porii Biliarii</hi>, the <hi
          rend="italic">Ductus Hepaticus</hi>, the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Hepati-cyſtici</hi>, and
        the <hi rend="italic">Ductus-cyſticus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Commu- <lb/>nis
          Choledochus</hi>, the principal of which are ſeated in <lb/>the Concavity of the great
        Lobe of the Liver, under <lb/>the Preſſure of this great and hard Tumour, and under <lb/>its
        Increaſe for near 14 Years together, Obſtructions <lb/>and Compreſſions generally accounted
        as primary and <lb/>idiopathick Cauſes of the Jaundice, becauſe no Diſtem- <lb/>per like the
        Jaundice had appear'd in our Patient till <lb/>within a few Months before his Death, and no
        true <pb n="324"/>
        <lb/>Jaundice till within a few Weeks, and only then as <lb/>the Abſceſs form'd in the
        Neighbourhood of the Liver <lb/>had brought an Inflammation there; but as all the
        <lb/>Symptoms of his Jaundice began to wear off, ſoon <lb/>after the <hi rend="italic"
          >Pus</hi> had got a Vent, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> as the Inflammation <lb/>of the
        Liver brought on occaſionally by a Suppuration <lb/>in the Neighbourhood wore off, and ſome
        Days be- <lb/>fore the burſting of the <hi rend="italic">Veſica Fellis</hi>, it does not
        appear <lb/>unlikely, this Inflammation of the Liver was the Pa- <lb/>thognomonick Cauſe of
        the Jaundice here; which In- <lb/>flammation of the Liver, as it was accidental, ſo the
        <lb/>Jaundice occaſion'd thereby was actually remov'd ſoon <lb/>after a Vent was made for
        the purulent Matter which <lb/>had occaſion'd this Inflammation. </p>
