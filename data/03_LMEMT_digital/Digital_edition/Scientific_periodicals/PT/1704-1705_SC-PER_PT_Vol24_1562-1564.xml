        <lb/>SIR, </salute>
      <p>
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>N the month of <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> 1693. I was called
        upon about <lb/>four a Clock in the morning, to ſee a Sailer on board <lb/>the <hi
          rend="italic">Albemarle</hi> Man of War, in a violent Calenture. He was <lb/>between 30
        and 40 years of age, brown hair'd, pretty tall, <lb/>but thin, and had not much fleſh about
        his Bones. When <lb/>I ſaw him firſt, I found him in the hands of 3 or 4 of his
        <lb/>Comrades, who were hardly able to manage him, becauſe <lb/>of his ſtrugglings, and
        conſtant endeavours to get from <lb/>them. I obſerved, he very often cryed out, he would
        <lb/>go into the green fields; his looks were as furious and <lb/>wild as thoſe of a Lyon,
        and every now and then he would <lb/>heartily curſe thoſe that held him. The firſt thing I
        did <lb/>was to examine his Pulſe, I felt, 'tis true, a diſorderly mo- <lb/>tion of the
        Blood in the Artery, and a burning fiery heat <lb/>all over his habit of body, but cou'd
        perceive no diſtincti- <lb/>on, or vibration of Pulſe at all. The Surgeon of the Ship,
        <lb/>a good experienc'd man in that way, had, before I came, <lb/>attempted to bleed him;
        but tho the Vein of the Arm was <lb/>fairly open'd, yet cou'd he not procure an ounce of
        Blood <lb/>from thence. Upon that I order'd him to open the fron- <lb/>tal Vein, which
        ſucceeded no better, for that ſoon ſtopt <lb/>too. This put me upon trying a third time,
        what effects <lb/>the opening the Jugular Vein might have. From this Vein, <lb/>tho our
        Orifice was pretty large, we had about 2 Ounces <lb/>of florid thick Blood, and then it
        quite ſtopt there too. <lb/>I was, I muſt confeſs not a little ſurpriz'd at this; and or-
        <lb/>der'd the Surgeon to unbind his Arm, and try whether he <lb/>could make him bleed again
        at that Orifice, which I re- <pb n="1563"/>
        <lb/>member he did in a ſmall quantity, and then ſtopt as be- <lb/>fore. However, having
        three Orifices open at that time, <lb/>we drew blood ſometimes from one, and ſometimes the
        <lb/>other, where we ſaw it run moſt freely. After ſeveral <lb/>eſſays of this kind, I
        always obſerved as the Veſſels emptied, <lb/>he bled more freely, and at laſt as faſt as I
        deſired. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Now I was all along of opinion, we ought to continue <lb/>his bleeding till we ſaw ſome
        viſible alterations, and conſi- <lb/>derable abatements of his Symptoms, which happen'd in
        <lb/>about half an hours time after I ſaw him, and then I felt <lb/>his Pulſe again, which
        now began to beat diſtinctly, but <lb/>very quick. Not long after this, for he bled well
        enough <lb/>now, I obſerv'd his Strugglings were not ſo ſtrong, his Ra- <lb/>vings and
        crying after green Fields left off, his wild Looks <lb/>much abated, and not only his Pulſe
        had recovered its <lb/>due and regular Vibrations, but his heats were moderated <lb/>too,
        and the Fury of his Spirits lay'd to that degree, that <lb/>he that juſt now was as furious
        as a Lyon, was grown ſo <lb/>tame, that one man was able eaſily to manage him as he
        <lb/>pleaſed. In this half hour, as near as we cou'd gueſs, we <lb/>took from him about
        fifty ounces of Blood from the three <lb/>Orifices mention'd. By this time I thought we had
        enough, <lb/>ſo I order'd him to his Hammack, as ſoon as we had ſe- <lb/>cured the Orifices
        from bleeding again, and directed the <lb/>Surgeon to give him an Ounce of Diacodium in a
        draught <lb/>of Barley Water, as he went into it: Upon this he ſlept <lb/>till about Noon,
        when he awaked with no other Com- <lb/>plaint, but of weakneſs from his loſs of Blood, and a
        ſore- <lb/>neſs all over his Body, occaſion'd, I preſume, from his vio- <lb/>lent
        Convulſions and Endeavours to get looſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This was the only Calenture I ſaw all the while I was <lb/>in the Fleet for near three
        years, two Summers of which I <lb/>ſerv'd in the <hi rend="italic">Mediterranean</hi>, and
        this happen'd in the <hi rend="italic">Bay <lb/>of Biſcay</hi>, in the Latitude of 47, in
        the month of <hi rend="italic">Auguſt</hi>. <lb/>They are, I hear, more frequent in warmer
        Climates, tho <lb/>very often undiſcover'd. </p>
      <pb n="1564"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The reaſon I imagin to be this, when they are ſeiz'd with <lb/>this violent Heat and
        Diſorder, which for the moſt part <lb/>happens in the Night, they ſteal privately over-board
        into <lb/>the Sea, imagining they're going into the green Fields. And <lb/>this I take to be
        the reaſon we ſee ſo few, tho I have heard <lb/>frequently in the <hi rend="italic"
          >Mediterranean</hi> in Summer time, and ve- <lb/>ry hot Weather, of Seamen loſt in the
        night, which the <lb/>Sailers took for granted were gone off upon ſuch like oc- <lb/>caſions
        unobſerved. And I remember very well, this per- <lb/>ſon was actually going over-board, when
        one of <lb/>his Brethren, who ſuſpected his deſign, as he told me, <lb/>caught hold of him
        juſt as he was going to leap off, call'd <lb/>for help, and ſecur'd him by this Accident. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This Diſtemper, I am of opinion, is what we call a <hi rend="italic">Phreni-
          <lb/>tis</hi>, occaſioned by a more than ordinary Efferveſcence and <lb/>heat of the
        Blood, which diſtracting and confounding, if <lb/>not inflaming the Animal Spirits, the
        proper and immedi- <lb/>ate Miniſters of the mind, is the cauſe of all thoſe irregular
        <lb/>motions, violent Exploſions and Convulſions. Hence 'tis <lb/>the Animal Idea's are
        confus'd, the Imagination deprav'd, <lb/>and all the rational Functions diſorder'd. From
        theſe <lb/>Orgaſms in the Animal Spirits, we may, I fancy, give ſome <lb/>account of the
        want of Pulſe too, their conſtant and im- <lb/>petuous Motions through the Fibres, not
        admitting any <lb/>diſtinct Arterial Vibrations. And perhaps Phlebotomy <lb/>did not ſucceed
        at firſt, becauſe the Orifices contracting <lb/>preſently prevented its Effuſion, and
        probably the thick- <lb/>neſs of the Blood concurr'd not a little in this Phænome- <lb/>non.
        His calling out for the green Fields, the true Criterion <lb/>of this Diſeaſe, I take to be
        from the violent heat he was <lb/>then in, which made him fancy green Fields and open Air
        <lb/>to cool himſelf in at that time, the Ship being too warm <lb/>for him under theſe
        Circumſtances, for want of Air. And <lb/>laſtly, Calentures happen oftner by Night than by
        day, <lb/>becauſe our Ships are moſt cloſely ſhut up by Night, and <lb/>are leſs airy than
        they are in the day time. </p>
