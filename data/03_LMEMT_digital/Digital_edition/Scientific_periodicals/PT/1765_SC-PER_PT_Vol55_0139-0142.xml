          of the 22d of June, 1764, <lb/>that a perſon, who, in conſequence of the bite of a
          <lb/>mad dog, was affected with the Hydrophobia, had been <lb/>cured at Padua by draughts
          of vinegar, I was willing <lb/>to get the beſt information of the true ſtate of the
          <lb/>fact. Accordingly I wrote to my acquaintance Ge- <lb/>neral Græme, commander in chief
          of the Venetian <lb/>forces, deſiring he would ſend me an accurate hiſtory <lb/>of this
          extraordinary cure; and ſome time ago I <lb/>received from him the incloſed account;
          which, if <lb/>you think proper, you may read before the Society. <lb/>The account in the
          Public Advertiſer, being ſo very <lb/>particular and circumſtantial, induced me at firſt
          to <pb n="140"/>
          <lb/>believe it might be well founded; in which caſe, ſo <lb/>valuable a diſcovery ought
          to have been publiſhed <lb/>every where: but, as it turns out to be altogether a
          <lb/>fallacy, the public ought equally to be undeceived. </p>

        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Dr. Bertoſſi, phyſician, and now profeſſor in the <lb/>univerſity of Padua, came to
          Venice in the laſt <lb/>ſpring, and brought an account to Dr. Reghellini, <lb/>that three
          hydrophobous perſons, all bit by the ſame <lb/>mad dog, had been treated in the hoſpital
          at Padua, <lb/>two of whom died, and only one eſcaped, and that <lb/>the perſon, who
          ſurvived, was cured by Dr. Leoniſſa <lb/>with vinegar, which he was made to ſwallow every
          <lb/>three hours in doſes of about four ounces at a time. <lb/>This cure, performed by Dr.
          Leoniſſa, was ſuggeſted <lb/>to him by a ſtudent of phyſic at Udine, who obſerved, <lb/>in
          the Friuli, a hydrophobous perſon, who was cured <pb n="141"/>
          <lb/>by means of a miſtake, that happened in the family, <lb/>by giving him vinegar to
          drink inſtead of water <note n="[a]" rend="size(0.7)">
            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>[<hi rend="italic">a</hi>] Dr. Bertoſſi ſaid in the Friuli. Count Leoniſſa ſays
              in <lb/>Lombardy. Perhaps ſome other perſon may have ſaid in Turin. </p>
          </note>. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Dr. Reghellini, willing to be thoroughly ſatisfied, <lb/>whether this acceptable
          diſcovery was ſtrictly true, <lb/>did immediately write to a friend of his, a phyſician
          <lb/>at Padua, ſtating all the circumſtances, which had <lb/>been related to him by Dr.
          Bertoſſi, and deſiring to <lb/>know, if the fact really was as it had been ſtated. His
          <lb/>friend, the phyſician, gave him for anſwer, that the <lb/>thing was true. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Dr. Reghellini thereupon communicated the caſe <lb/>to the phyſicians of the hoſpital
          of Florence and <lb/>Piſa, and deſired them to make trial of it, the firſt
          <lb/>opportunity that ſhould offer, and acquaint him with <lb/>the ſucceſs. He likewiſe
          communicated it to his <lb/>other friends, amongſt which was Dr. Turton, an <lb/>Engliſh
          phyſician then at Venice; and to Dr. de la <lb/>Fontaine, a phyſician, who attended Lord
          Spencer <note n="[b]" rend="size(0.7)" place="bottom">
            <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>[<hi rend="italic">b</hi>] Probably the account publiſhed in England may have
              <lb/>come from one of theſe two gentlemen. </p>
          </note>. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Dr. Reghellini judged, that ſo uncommon an event <lb/>ought to be publiſhed with all
          its circumſtances; <lb/>and having in his poſſeſſion the hiſtory of eight and <lb/>twenty
          hydrophobous perſons, though in different <lb/>manners, and treated by different
          phyſicians, fifteen <lb/>of whom were afterwards opened, and the bodies <lb/>carefully
          examined, he thought from thence he <lb/>might compoſe a rational and uſeful tract.
          Therefore <lb/>he went to Padua, to have a perſonal interview with <lb/>Count Leoniſſa,
          the phyſician; but in this con- <lb/>ference diſcovered, that the man, who was ſaid to <pb
            n="142"/>
          <lb/>have been cured with the uſe of vinegar, really never <lb/>had the hydrophobia,
          although he had been aſſured, <lb/>that Dr. Bertoſſi ſaw him in the hydrophobous ſtate.
          <lb/>That man, it was true, did receive a very ſlight and <lb/>ſuperficial ſcratch upon
          his cheek from the ſame <lb/>dog, who bit the other two perſons, who became
          <lb/>hydrophobous, and afterwards died; but the perſon, <lb/>of whom the account was
          publiſhed, about the <lb/>uſeful diſcovery of a cure by vinegar, was in reality <lb/>never
          arrived to the ſtate of the hydrophobia; that <lb/>is to ſay, to ſuch a degree of the
          malady, as moſt <lb/>frequently follows the bite of a mad dog, and which, <lb/>after ſome
          weeks, diſcovers itſelf by an uneaſineſs in <lb/>attempting to drink; and after drinking,
          by a fe- <lb/>ver, delirium, convulſions, vomiting, ſweating, and <lb/>death, within the
          fifth, and ſometimes within the <lb/>fourth day. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Dr. Reghellini, having thus found, that the account <lb/>firſt given him, and the
          confirmation of it from his <lb/>friend at Padua, were doubtful, or rather a miſap-
          <lb/>prehenſion, wrote again to Florence and Piſa, re- <lb/>tracting his former account,
          and relating the fact, as <lb/>upon a more ſtrict examination he had found it truly
          <lb/>to be, and which is exactly agreeable to the account <lb/>here incloſed. </p>
