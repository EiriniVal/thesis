          <hi rend="italic">Phyſick</hi> is attended with ſo <lb/>many Diſcouragements, it is ſuch
          <lb/>an expenſive, tedious, difficult <lb/>way to Science, that one who has any

            <hi rend="italic">Youth</hi> upon a ſhorter and eaſier <pb xml:id="page_4" n="10"
          /><lb/>road. The Pride and Ill-nature, perhaps the <lb/>Avarice too, of the Learned in
          every Science, <lb/>would gladly make a myſtery of the art they <lb/>profeſs, and render
          it inacceſſible but to a few. <lb/>Ask a Gentleman of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Aeſculapian</hi> tribe, <lb/>what courſe of Education is requiſite to the <lb/>making
          of a <hi rend="italic">Phyſician?</hi> He will preſently <lb/>tell you, that a young Man
          who would <w part="I">ſuc-</w><lb/><w part="F">ceſſfully</w> apply himſelf to the Study of
            <hi rend="italic">Me-<lb/>dicine,</hi> muſt firſt of all have an <w part="I"
            >Underſtand-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> capable of Inſtruction; and that after he
          <lb/>is pretty far advanced in the Languages and <lb/>ſuch other pieces of Learning as he
          imagines <lb/>to be neceſſarily previous and introductory <lb/>to Phyſick, he muſt ſtudy
          every particular <lb/>Branch of that Science under able Teachers, <lb/>and labour night
          and day for God knows <lb/>how many years, before he can be ſuppoſed <lb/>fit to Practiſe.
          Very modeſt Demands truly! <lb/>This is either the moſt malicious fetch <lb/>or the
          ſimpleſt miſtake in the world: for in <lb/>reality, Learning is no more neceſſary to a
            <lb/><hi rend="italic">Phyſician</hi> than to a <hi rend="italic">Fidler.</hi> And for
          all this <lb/>pother, I am miſtaken too if I cannot lay <lb/>down a Method, by the
          religious and ſtrict <lb/>obſervance of which, a young man <w part="I">(what-</w><lb/><w

            Spirits</hi> worth <lb/>calculating, drop into the world not only a <lb/>ripe <hi
            rend="italic">Surgeon</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Phyſician,</hi> but <hi rend="italic"

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Well then, to begin with the <hi rend="italic">previous</hi>
          <lb/>Qualifications of our Student. He muſt be <lb/>provided by bountiful <hi
            rend="italic">Nature,</hi> with an <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">exhauſtible</w>
          fund of <hi rend="italic">Aſſurance,</hi> that <hi rend="italic">cardinal
            <lb/>Virtue,</hi> which without the aſſiſtance of any <lb/>other is ſufficient to make a
          great man. A <pb xml:id="page_6" n="12"/><lb/>little <hi rend="italic">Senſe</hi> would
          not be amiſs; but as this <lb/>is ſeldom an Ingredient in a Conſtitution <lb/>where the
          other predominates, and as it is <lb/>not abſolutely neceſſary, we ſhall not reckon
          <lb/>upon it. <hi rend="italic">Impudence</hi> alone will do, for it <lb/>gives ſuch a <hi
            rend="italic">force</hi> to the otherways <hi rend="italic">lighteſt</hi>
          <lb/>Merit, that the Addreſs, or rather the Aſſault, <lb/>of a man who poſſeſſes it to any
          eminent <w part="I">de-</w><lb/><w part="F">gree</w>, is not to be reſiſted. If beſides he
          can <lb/>make a ſhift to read <hi rend="italic">Corderius</hi> with the help <lb/>of a
          Dictionary, that is to ſay, if he has a <lb/><hi rend="italic">Quantum ſufficit</hi> of
            <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> to enable him to <lb/>underſtand a <hi rend="italic"
            >Recipe</hi> and to accent a <hi rend="italic">hard word</hi>
          <lb/>gracefully, he is now fitted to attempt the <lb/>moſt arduous parts of the <hi
            rend="italic">Study.</hi>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>As ſoon therefore as our young man is <lb/>thus hopefully qualified,
          let him forthwith <lb/>be bound Apprentice for two or three years <lb/>to an <hi
            rend="italic">Apothecary,</hi> who <hi rend="italic">preſides</hi> like a <hi

          His main buſineſs during the time of <lb/>his Apprenticeſhip will be, to ſpread now
          <lb/>and then a <hi rend="italic">Plaiſter,</hi> ſometimes to make up <lb/>an <hi
            rend="italic">Electuary</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">Maſs of Pills,</hi> to adminiſter

          this laſt may not appear <lb/>to be a very liberal Office, yet as far as it <lb/>will give
          him an occaſion to become <w part="I">acquain-</w><lb/><w part="F">ted</w> with the
          Conſtitution of that generous <lb/>Animal, and with the general <hi rend="italic"
            >Regimen</hi> that <lb/>ſuits it beſt, he will find it of mighty <w part="I"
            >ad-</w><lb/><w part="F">vantage</w> to him afterwards, when he comes <lb/>to exerciſe
          the <hi rend="italic">Hippohiatrical</hi> Function, the <lb/>cultivation of which makes a

            >Practice</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Medicine,</hi> in <lb/>ſome parts of the Country.
          When he is at <lb/>leiſure from theſe more important <hi rend="italic">Duties,</hi> he
          <lb/>may, if he pleaſes, glance over ſome ſhort <lb/>general Syſtem of <hi rend="italic"
            >Anatomy.</hi> I muſt own <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">deed</w> this is almoſt a
          needleſs trouble, yet I <lb/>would have him able to tell upon occaſion <lb/>whether the
            <hi rend="italic">Stomach</hi> lies in the <hi rend="italic">Abdomen</hi>
          <lb/>or in the <hi rend="italic">Thorax,</hi> and the like, if it were only for
          <lb/>ornament's ſake, and to keep him in <w part="I">coun-</w><lb/><w part="F">tenance</w>
          among thoſe people who have got a <lb/>notion that ſome acquaintance with the <w part="I"
            >ſtruc-</w><lb/><w part="F">ture</w> of the Human Body is neceſſary to a <lb/><hi
            rend="italic">Phyſician;</hi> for we muſt not hope to reform <lb/>the world all at once.
          When he has thus <pb xml:id="page_8" n="14"/><lb/>laid a good Foundation in <hi
            rend="italic">Anatomy,</hi> to which <lb/>I allow him a month, or, if his Maſter rides
          <lb/>much and the roads are dirty, ſix weeks, let <lb/>him proceed to the <hi
            rend="italic">Practice of Phyſick</hi> and <lb/><hi rend="italic">Surgery:</hi> A ſhort
          Syſtem for each will be <lb/>ſufficient. He will frequently have occaſion <lb/>to practiſe
            <hi rend="italic">Chemie</hi> under his Maſter's eye, and <lb/>thus may gain a competent
          skill in this Branch <lb/>of the Study without the fatigue of Reading. <lb/>A <hi
            rend="italic">Botaniſt</hi> he muſt grow, whether he will <lb/>or not. And as for the
            <hi rend="italic">Materia Medica</hi> and <lb/><hi rend="italic">Methodus
            praeſcribendi,</hi> he may make himſelf <lb/>Maſter of theſe in this manner. As often as
          <lb/>a Phyſician's Bill comes to his Maſter's Shop, <lb/>let him out with his Pocket-book,
            <hi rend="italic">ſlap it down <lb/>and make it his own,</hi> according to Mr. <hi
            rend="italic">Bayes</hi>'s <lb/><hi rend="italic">Rule of Records.</hi> As he muſt have
          frequent <lb/>acceſs to know, againſt what Diſeaſe this or <lb/>that Preſcription was
          deſign'd, let him <w part="I">there-</w><lb/><w part="F">fore</w> devote a page or ſo in
          his <w part="I">Pocket-com-</w><lb/><w part="F">panion</w> to every Diſeaſe, and under
          each of <lb/>theſe let him range the Preſcriptions adapted <lb/>thereto. Thus when he
          engages in the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Practice</hi> himſelf, whatever Diſeaſe ſhall fall
          <lb/>in his way, he has no more to do but turn <lb/>over his <hi rend="italic">Vade
            mecum,</hi> where he will probably <lb/>find ſomething proper for it. With regard <pb
            xml:id="page_9" n="15"/><lb/>to the different <hi rend="italic">Stages</hi> of Diſeaſes,
          the various <lb/><hi rend="italic">Combinations of Symptoms,</hi> and the like, <lb/>theſe
          are <hi rend="italic">ſubtile trifles</hi> that none but your <lb/><hi rend="italic"

          <lb/>as he has not got ſufficient intelligence to <lb/>warrant his reducing under the

          part of the Country where the <lb/>exerciſe of ſuch elegant Arts is the reigning
          <lb/>Diverſion or Buſineſs. For they will almoſt <lb/>infallibly recommend him to the

          If, added to this, he be a <hi rend="italic">good <lb/>Shot,</hi> and can roar at a

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>Now as ſoon as our <hi rend="italic">Phyſician</hi> begins to lay

          <lb/>In this caſe, the larger that he picks his <pb xml:id="page_15" n="21"/><lb/>ſtones

            >Miracles,</hi> they ſay, <hi rend="italic">are ceaſed, the Beaſt with <lb/>many

            >It</hi> likes hugely too to be <w part="I">re-</w><lb/><w part="F">galed</w> with hard

        </p>

          after he has felt <lb/>his Pulſe, viewed his Water, and asked him <lb/>a few Queſtions, he
          may proceed in this <lb/>manner—<q rend="quotes">It is very lucky for you, <hi

            <lb/>not been an hour in his Stomach, till he <lb/>grew monſtrous ſick, and fell a

            /><lb/>roar and curſe, and toſs and tumble, and <lb/>run hobbling and crouching up and
            down <lb/>with his Guts in his Arms, ſcrewing his Face, <lb/>ſweating like a Horſe, and
            looking as pale <lb/>as Aſhes, that but for his Immortality one <lb/>would not imagine
            he could have lived in <lb/>that Condition two hours. The Villain of <lb/>an Empirick

            be a <hi rend="italic">Doctor,</hi> as they <lb/>call them, with a vengeance, tho' it
            were <lb/>in ſpight of both Nature and Education. <lb/>And what wiſe Method do you think
            they <lb/>fall upon to accompliſh this great work? A <lb/>very ſhort one you'll ſay.
            They have no <lb/>Notion of Education themſelves, and they <lb/>are not able to bear the
            Expences of <w part="I">intro-</w><lb/><w part="F">ducing</w> their Sons regularly to
            the knowledge <lb/>of the <hi rend="italic">Art.</hi> But inſtead of this, they place
            <lb/>a raw unletter'd Lad for two or three years <lb/>under the Care of ſome Apothecary,
            who <lb/>perhaps does not know a great deal more <lb/>than his Apprentice. Here he
            fancies he <lb/>learns not only to prepare and compound <lb/>Medicines, but, by peruſing
            and Common-<lb/>placing the Phyſicians Bills, how to apply <lb/>them too forſooth. And
            ſo at laſt, by a <lb/>happy Deluſion, he thinks himſelf not only <lb/>an Apothecary, but
            a Phyſician. Thus, <lb/>what by his own proper Fund of Ignorance, <lb/>what by his
            Maſter's, improving it, he comes <lb/>out at laſt a doubly greater Fool than he <w

            <lb/>and want of Senſe give him Aſſurance, and <pb xml:id="page_30" n="36"/><lb/>the
            Lowneſs of his Education preſerves him <lb/>at liberty from the comberſome Shackles of
            <lb/>Honour and Honeſty, if he has but ſleight <lb/>enough to ſave himſelf from

            upon a yet eaſier way of <lb/>ſcaling the Heights of Phyſick, by ſetting up <lb/>upon
            ſomething that they call a <hi rend="italic">Noſtrum,</hi> left <lb/>them in a Legacy by
            their Grand-mother, by <lb/>which they pretend infallibly to cure ſome one, <lb/>or

            if it <lb/>were not that, of all the Myriads that daily <lb/>deſcend to Hell, there is
            ſcarce One of Six, <lb/>but what lays the Blame of his untimely <lb/>Fate upon the
            Quacks. So that at laſt, he <lb/>begun to conſider them with another eye, and <lb/>to
            remit of his Indulgence towards them, as <lb/>dreading they would at this rate in a
            ſhort <lb/>time quite deſtroy the Brood of Mankind, <lb/>and ſo cut off all future
            Supplies to his <lb/>Realms. But now this Affair I preſume <lb/>will compleat their
            Diſgrace, and entirely <lb/>ruin them with <hi rend="italic">Pluto.</hi> They have for a
            <lb/>long time played their <hi rend="italic">Pills, Drops,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >Po-<lb/>tions</hi> here upon the poor Wretches that are <lb/>miſerable enough
            beſides. But there was <w part="I">ne-</w><lb/><w part="F">ver</w> any ear given to
            their Complaints, for it <lb/>was ſuſpected to be all meer Fetch and <w part="I"
              >Kna-</w><lb/><w part="F">very</w>, and that they were only ſick to get <pb
              xml:id="page_32" n="38"/><lb/>the Rigour and wholeſome Diſcipline of our <lb/>Infernal
            Regions a little abated. And but <lb/>the other day, one of theſe Miſcreants, as <lb/>he
            was paſſing by <hi rend="italic">Tantalus,</hi> who was crying <lb/>out of Thirſt after
            his old rate, ſtop'd and <lb/>told him, that Symptom was entirely owing <lb/>to the <hi
              rend="italic">redundant Choler</hi> in his Blood, and <lb/>that he could give him a
              <hi rend="italic">Potion</hi> that would <lb/>purge it off to his great Relief. Poor
              <hi rend="italic">Tan-<lb/>talus,</hi> who was glad to drink any thing, <lb/>made but
            one Draught of his <hi rend="italic">Potion,</hi> and <lb/>poured a thouſand Bleſſings
            upon his <w part="I">pre-</w><lb/><w part="F">tended</w> Benefactor. But it proved a
            bitter <lb/>Draught to him. For it handled him ſo <lb/>unmercifully, and, inſtead of
            having his <lb/>Thirſt quenched by it, he called out at laſt <lb/>ſo pitifully for
            Drink, and ſwooned away <lb/>ſo often, that he was obliged to be taken <lb/>out of his
            Tub: And now that his great <lb/>rage of Sickneſs is abated, they are e'en fain <lb/>to
            cocker him up with Broths and Jellies <lb/>to fill his empty Veſſels again. Such things
            <lb/>as theſe paſſed without being much taken <lb/>notice of, and for the moſt part
            without <lb/>being credited; but I ſhall wonder if theſe <lb/>Varlets are not called to
            a ſevere Account, <lb/>now that the Gods themſelves can't live for <pb xml:id="page_33"
              n="39"/><lb/>them. For you muſt know that, juſt about <lb/>the time that <hi

              >Charon</hi> got his Doſe too. </p>
          <p rend="indent"><lb/><hi rend="italic">Hyg.</hi> No ſure! How in the name of <w part="I"

          <p rend="indent"><lb/><hi rend="italic">Merc.</hi> No faith; He was as ſober as I <lb/>am
            juſt now: but you ſhall hear how it <w part="I">hap-</w><lb/><w part="F">pened</w>. One
            of theſe Poiſon-mongers, who <lb/>wanted a Caſt over, but had not a Farthing <lb/>to pay
            his Fare, bethought himſelf of a ſly <lb/>Expedient. He takes his Seat juſt by the
            <lb/>old Waterman, and begins to make his <lb/>Court by complimenting him upon his <w

              >Greenness</hi> of his <lb/>old Age; but at the ſame time could not <lb/>help
            obſerving that his Skin diſgraced them, <lb/>(for you know he is not very nice about
            <lb/>his Linnens, and does not go into a Bath <lb/>perhaps once in a Century) and that
            he had <lb/>contracted ſomething of a <hi rend="italic">Scorbutick Taint,</hi>
            <lb/>by having lived ſo long upon the Water. <lb/>But if he would accept of ſome Doſes
            of his <lb/><hi rend="italic">Pulvis Scelotyrbicus,</hi> and now and then <pb
              xml:id="page_34" n="40"/><lb/>make uſe of the warm Bath, he might ſoon <lb/>become as
            ſleek and pure as a Snake that <lb/>has juſt caſt his Slough. <hi rend="italic"
              >Charon</hi> at firſt <lb/>made him ſurly enough Anſwers, and was <lb/>like to have
            grown very rough, but the <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſinuating</w> Raſcal plied
            him ſo with poſitive <lb/>Remonſtrances, that the ſimple old Dotard <lb/>began at laſt
            to imagine that his Skin really <lb/>itched. He told him, that what he ſaid <lb/>might
            be true enough, but that he had not <lb/>Leiſure to take Phyſick. The <w part="I"
              >unconſcio-</w><lb/><w part="F">nable</w> Knave replied, that the Medicine <lb/>which
            he had to offer him was an <hi rend="italic">Alterative</hi>
            <lb/>and acted inſenſibly, ſo that he needed not <lb/>loſe a Moment's Buſineſs, nor ſo
            much as <lb/>change his Diet for it. Well, not to tire you <lb/>with a long Tale, <hi
              rend="italic">Charon</hi> takes the <hi rend="italic">Powders</hi>
            <lb/>in lieu of Fare, which was all that the <w part="I">Raſ-</w><lb/><w part="F"
              >cal</w> wanted. And one Doſe has wrought <lb/>him ſo heartily, that if they were to
            cure <lb/>him of a <hi rend="italic">Leproſy,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi rend="italic"
              >Cerberus</hi> may <lb/>take the reſt for him. He was obliged to <lb/>crawl out of his
            Boat into a Hut by the <w part="I">Ri-</w><lb/><w part="F">ver's</w> ſide, where he lies
            curſing and <w part="I">blaſ-</w><lb/><w part="F">pheming</w> at a hideous rate, and is

            too, not a Rag of a Quack comes <lb/>into the Boat as long as I'm Maſter. They <lb/>make

            <lb/>of the Lake till <hi rend="italic">Charon</hi> is ready to take care <lb/>of them
            himſelf; and if he does not take care <lb/>of them with a vengeance, as ſoon as he gets
            <lb/>upon his Stumps again, I ſhall ſay his <hi rend="italic">Cho-<lb/>ler is purged
              off</hi> effectually. There is as good <lb/>as Ten or a Dozen of them already, and
            they <lb/>are become ſo bold, that if I did not keep <lb/>them at a diſtance by bruſhing

            when they come <lb/>under <hi rend="italic">Charon</hi>'s Diſcipline. It will delight
            <lb/>one to ſee how he'll tear and lay about him, <lb/>and how the poor Scoundrels will
            ſcamper <lb/>up and down, as if they walk'd upon hot <lb/>Iron. </p>
          <p rend="indent"><lb/><hi rend="italic">Hyg.</hi> Yes, I preſume they'll ſtand in need
