                empirical ſect, rejecting all theory <lb/>and reaſoning, became ſhamefully
                illiterate—Others, that <lb/>the word <hi rend="italic">inglorius</hi> alludes to
                the phyſicians at Rome, in Virgil's time, <lb/>being generally ſlaves. Others again
                contend, that the word <hi rend="italic">mu-<lb/>tas</hi> relates to <hi
                  rend="italic">inglorius;</hi> and that Virgil thereby intimated, that <lb/>phyſic
                was an art of no great renown in the world, and brought <lb/>its profeſſors no great
                glory or reputation. But unfortunately <lb/>none of theſe opinions will paſs muſter:
                For, 1ſt. The ſect of <lb/>empirics had no exiſtence till many ages after the time
                of Iapis. <lb/>2dly. In the time of Iapis, phyſic could not be a contemptible or

                Nay, Homer tells us, that a phyſician,<lb/>even in thoſe times, was counted of more

              to conſiſt only of ſuch things as would give eaſe, and <lb/>exhilerate the ſpirits of

              <lb/>contributed to eſtabliſh him in this elevated ſtation, was <lb/>his having

          <lb/>'as ſoon as the morbific matter is expelled to <lb/>the ſurface of the body, the
          fever ceaſes:" <lb/>therefore, 'the fever is an effort of <hi rend="sc">Nature</hi>
          <lb/>to relieve herſelf.' But it is well known to <lb/>every experienced practitioner,
          that the leſs the <pb xml:id="page_39" n="40"/><lb/>fever is in the natural ſmall-pox, the
          fewer will <lb/>be the puſtules, and the variolous matter more <lb/>happily expelled; or,
          according to our great <lb/><hi rend="italic">Sydenbam, [Angliæ lumen, artis Phæbum]</hi>
          "Quo <lb/>ſedatior eſt ſanguis eo melius erumpent <w part="I">puſ-</w><lb/><w part="F"

        <p rend="indent"><lb/>It has indeed been a received opinion, almoſt <lb/>ever ſince the
          firſt appearance of the ſmall-<lb/>pox<note place="bottom" n="*">* The ſmall-pox was firſt
            deſcribed, and treated of by <lb/><hi rend="italic">Aaron</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
              >Alexandria,</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Pandects of phyſic,</hi> which he

            <w part="I">accord-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> to <hi rend="italic">Haly Abbas</hi>'s

            extant of the preciſe æra of this diſeaſe, nor in what <lb/>country it firſt appeared.
            The moſt probable opinion is, <lb/>that it had its riſe in <hi rend="italic">Arabia
              Fælix,</hi> and was brought from <lb/>thence to <hi rend="italic">Alexandria</hi> by
            the <hi rend="italic">Arabs,</hi> when they took that <lb/>city, A. D. 640, in the reign

            <lb/>not be impertinent to remark, on this occaſion, that he <lb/>carried the <hi

            by Mr. Sutton himſelf, as evidently appears <lb/>from his method of treating the <hi

          </note> in Europe, that 'a certain degree of <w part="I">fe-</w><pb xml:id="page_40"

          <lb/>was practiſed by <hi rend="italic">Mr. Glaſs,</hi> an eminent ſurgeon <lb/>in the
