        <p rend="indent"><lb/>ALTHOUGH publiſhers of receipts have been always very numerous, yet it
          has ſo happened, that the leaſt able have hitherto undertaken this task, as the moſt eaſy
          and likely to anſwer any <w part="I">merce-</w><lb/><w part="F">nary</w> views; which
          ſeems to have been the reaſon, that more able perſons have neglected it as an under part
          of their profeſſion. <w part="I">Ne-</w><lb/><w part="F">vertheless</w>, I have perſuaded
          myſelf, that I ſhould perform a work, neither entirely void, of uſe, nor foreign to the
          duties of my <w part="I">pro-</w><lb/><w part="F">feſſion</w>, if I made the public
          partakers of the principal helps againſt moſt diſeaſes, which I had either learned by long
          experience, or ſelected from the writings of the moſt <w part="I">emi-</w><lb/><w part="F"
            >nent</w> phyſicians. As theſe receipts are <w part="I">pub-</w><lb/><w part="F"
            >liſhed</w> chiefly for the uſe of perſons reſiding in the country, whoſe convenience or
          abilities, will not allow of the attendance of a phyſician or apothecary, I have ſtudied
          plainneſs in my ſtile, and in my directions, with regard to the treatment of diſeaſes,
          that I might render this treatiſe as uſeful as poſſible. </p>

        </head>
        <p rend="indent"><lb/>THE favourable reception this work has met with, as is ſufficiently
          ſhewn by the remarkable quick ſale of the firſt large impreſſion, has induced the editor
          (to ſupport the credit of what is really <w part="I">bene-</w><lb/><w part="F">ficial</w>
          to the public, and add weight to the receipts) to publiſh the authorities from whence
          thoſe receipts were taken; and to make it ſtill more uſeful, has added the ſigns of
          diſeaſes, and ſome plain and conciſe <w part="I">direc-</w><lb/><w part="F">tions</w> for
          bleeding: he begs leave to remark, that although Dr. Theobald has given no more than one
          receipt for the cure of ſeveral diſorders, yet he has been careful to ſelect ſuch, <hi
            rend="italic">only,</hi> as upon a long experience were found to be the beſt; and that
          although <w part="I">re-</w><lb/><w part="F">ceipts</w> are given for diſeaſes which are
          ſeldom cured, (as the apoplexy, conſumption, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>) yet if it is
          in the power of medicine to remove any of theſe complaints, there is the greateſt reaſon
          to imagine, that the remedies directed in this pamphlet will effect a cure. </p>
