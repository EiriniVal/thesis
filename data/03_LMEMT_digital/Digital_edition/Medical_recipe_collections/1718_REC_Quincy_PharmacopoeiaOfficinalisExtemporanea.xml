          out thoſe which are <lb/>quite neglected in Practice, and not to <lb/>be met with in the
          Shops. Next will <lb/>be collected many from Dr. <hi rend="italic">Bates</hi>'s <lb/><hi
            rend="italic">Pharmacopœia</hi>; and afterwards from <lb/>any other Author or Perſon,
          whoſe <lb/>Compoſitions have had Merit e- <lb/>nough to bring them into the Shops,
          <lb/>and give them a place in Preſcrip- <lb/>tion. Some Recipe's alſo will be
          <lb/>retain'd, as have fallen into diſre- <lb/>gard, either thro the difficulty of
          <lb/>making, or their liableneſs to So- <lb/>phiſtication, which are of uncom- <lb/>mon
          Efficacy; and likewiſe ſome <lb/>inſerted, which may be preſumed <lb/>worth bringing into
          the rank of Of- <lb/>ficinal Medicines, both upon the <lb/>account of their eaſy

          <lb/>ſition, or cannot be drawn out by <lb/>that particular Preparation, which <lb/>ſuch a
          Medicine is to be manag'd <lb/>by. As in the Waters, for inſtance, <lb/>under each <hi

          <lb/>poſition, or are of ſuch a Texture as <lb/>will not part with them by Diſtilla-
          <lb/>tion, to what comes over the Helm; <lb/>and ſo in other Forms, according to <lb/>the
          Nature of the Ingredients, the <lb/>Intention of the Medicine, and the <lb/>particular
          Management, by which <lb/>it is reduc'd into ſuch a Form. <lb/>The whole Materials of this

          Method in the preceding Part <lb/>of <hi rend="italic">Simples</hi>, which has been
          directed <lb/>by their Virtues and Intentions in <lb/>Cure, would have made this too
          <lb/>perplexed, and have given more <lb/>trouble than the Advantages of it <lb/>could
          anſwer. And in this likewiſe, <lb/>as in the former, what Medicines are <lb/>not well
          reducible under any par- <lb/>ticular Diviſion, have a Section <lb/>given to them apart at

            are much more conveniently <lb/>drawn out by other Proceſſes: and <lb/>therefore it may
            be concluded, that <lb/>no wiſe Perſon will look in a di- <lb/>ſtill'd Water for any

            little un- <lb/>der this diviſion comes over weighty <lb/>enough to affect even the
            Urinary Se- <lb/>cretions: and therefore all which re- <cb n="2"/>
            <lb/>quire groſſer and more efficacious In- <lb/>ſtruments, are excluded from hence;
