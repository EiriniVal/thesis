      </p>
      <list>
        <lb/>
        <item>1. If the Term <hi rend="italic">Midwifery</hi> is properly <w part="I">ap-</w><lb/><w
            part="F">plied</w> to the Practice of that Art, when <lb/>in the Hands of either Sex,

          be in Propriety of Speech call'd a <lb/><hi rend="italic">Midwife?</hi>

          Woman in the preſent Caſe, <lb/>than of the <hi rend="italic">Sex</hi> of the Perſon
          practiſing? </item>
        <lb/>
        <item>3. On receding from the common Form <lb/>and Cuſtom of Speech in this Caſe, is
          <lb/>not the ſuppoſed Abſurdity exchang'd <lb/>for <hi rend="italic"
            >Unintelligibility?</hi> That is, what Idea <lb/>can be fix'd to, what Etymology found
          <lb/>for the new Term <hi rend="italic">Midman</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >Mid-<lb/>woman?</hi>
        </item>
      </list>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>The Word <hi rend="italic">Midman,</hi> he owns himſelf, <lb/>is not an

          >tainly</w> carries (to uſe his own Words) <hi rend="italic">more <lb/>Nonſenſe in the
          very Front of it,</hi> than the <lb/>Term he has endeavoured to explode. <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Cuſtom</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Uſe</hi> hath always the Effect of <lb/>a
          <hi rend="italic">Law;</hi>
      </p>
      <q rend="align-right"><p rend="indent italic"><lb/>Quem penes arbitrium eſt &amp; jus &amp;
          norma loquendi. </p>
        <bibl rend="italic">Hor. </bibl></q>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>And what is <hi rend="italic">Language</hi> but a <hi rend="italic"
          >cuſtomary</hi> and <lb/>receiv'd uſe of Words? So that we may <lb/>ſee the Term <hi
          rend="italic">Man-Midwife</hi> may be <w part="I">de-</w><lb/><w part="F">fended</w>, both
        from <hi rend="italic">Cuſtom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Propriety,</hi>
        <lb/>and will doubtleſs be in uſe long after Mr. <lb/><hi rend="italic">Douglaſs</hi>

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>In <hi rend="italic">Page</hi> 3. Mr. <hi rend="italic">Douglaſs</hi>
        falls very foul <lb/>on the Character of the celebrated Dr. <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Chamberlen,</hi> repreſenting him as <hi rend="italic">puzzling</hi>
        <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">confounding</hi> the Art he profeſs'd, to <lb/>the Advantage of
        moſt of the greateſt <lb/>Families in this Kingdom, rather than <hi rend="italic"
          >im-<lb/>proving</hi> it; and very indecently, and <w part="I">un-</w><lb/><w part="F"
          >juſtly</w> too, brands him as an <hi rend="italic">artful</hi> and <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >inſinuating</hi> Tranſlator. He ſays, he rather <lb/><hi rend="italic">darkens,</hi> than
          <hi rend="italic">explains</hi> his Author's (<hi rend="italic">Mau-<lb/>riceau</hi>'s)
        Meaning; and confidently affirms, <lb/><hi rend="italic">all the additional Knowledge he was
          the <lb/>Author of,</hi> to be only to tell the World, <lb/>that <hi rend="italic"
          >He,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Family,</hi> can aſſiſt Women <lb/>in Labour better
        than any body elſe, and <lb/>gives him the mean <hi rend="italic">Epithet</hi> of a <hi
          rend="italic">Noſtrum-<lb/>monger.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Page</hi> 4.) He pronounces
        every <lb/>thing with an <hi rend="italic">ipſe dixit,</hi> like a ſecond <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Ariſtotle,</hi> and ſets himſelf up at once, <pb xml:id="page_6" n="7"
        /><lb/>both for <hi rend="italic">Judge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jury.</hi> The late <w
          part="I">learn-</w><lb/><w part="F">ed</w> Dr. <hi rend="italic">Friend,</hi> in his
        Epiſtle to Dr. <hi rend="italic">Mead, <lb/>about Purging in the Small Pox,</hi> gives Dr.
          <lb/><hi rend="italic">Chamberlen</hi> a very different Character from <lb/>Mr. <hi
          rend="italic">Douglaſs,</hi> ſpeaking of him as one <hi rend="italic">moſt <lb/>skilful in
          the Art he profeſs'd;</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Hiſt.</hi> 5.) <lb/>Whence we may plainly
        ſee, how different <lb/>the Character of the ſame Perſon is, when <lb/>drawn by <hi
          rend="italic">real</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pretended</hi> Judges. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/><hi rend="italic">P.</hi> 5. He taxes him with perverting <lb/>Mr. <hi
          rend="italic">Mauriceau</hi>'s Deſign by his Tranſlation, <lb/>and having his own Litereſt
        at heart more <lb/>than that of the <hi rend="italic">Midwomen,</hi> as he <w part="I"
          >ridicu-</w><lb/><w part="F">louſly</w> terms them. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>He accuſes him of <hi rend="italic">coaxing</hi> the <w part="I"
          >Mid-</w><lb/><w part="F">women</w>, and yet in the ſame Sentence <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >coaxes</hi> them himſelf, and pays a fulſome <lb/>Compliment to the Qualifications of the
          <lb/><hi rend="italic">Town Midwomen</hi> above thoſe in the <hi rend="italic"
          >Coun-<lb/>try. P.</hi> 5. The <hi rend="italic">Town Midwomen</hi> may <lb/>poſſibly
        (ſome of them) become his <hi rend="italic">Pupils,</hi>
        <lb/>when he gives his intended <hi rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> and <lb/>ſo ought in
        Prudence to be well ſpoken <lb/>of. But thoſe in the Country being too <lb/>remote for this
        extraordinary Advantage, <lb/>will, for aught I can ſee, in his Opinion, <lb/>ſtill labour
        under the Imputation of being <lb/><hi rend="italic">unqualified</hi> ('till his Scheme for
        having <hi rend="italic">Mid-<lb/>men</hi> to inſtruct the <hi rend="italic">Midwomen</hi>
        in Country <lb/>places can take Effect) unleſs their Affairs <lb/>can permit them to take a

        the only Perſon <w part="I">pro-</w><lb/><w part="F">per</w> to inſtruct them is to be met
        with. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Upon Dr. <hi rend="italic">Chamberlen's</hi> ſaying, <q rend="quotes"
          >that <lb/>in Countries and Places where Advice <lb/>is not ſeaſonably to be had, Midwifes
          <lb/>are compelled to do their beſt, <hi rend="italic">as God <lb/>ſhall enable</hi> them
          (P. 5.)</q> which is a <lb/>common Expreſſion for a conſcientious <lb/>diſcharge of their
        Duty, according to the <lb/>beſt of their Abilities. Mr. <hi rend="italic">Douglass</hi>
        takes <lb/>occaſion here, to cut a very indecent <hi rend="italic">Joke</hi>
        <lb/>upon the <hi rend="italic">Deity,</hi> by asking, <hi rend="italic">if God has any
          <lb/>where promiſed to give any more Aſſiſtance <lb/>to a Country, than a Town
          Midwoman?</hi>
        <lb/>In the next place, he ſubſtitutes <hi rend="italic">God</hi> and <lb/>the <hi

        and Aſſiduity, which <lb/>in holy Writ he has aſſured us he will; <lb/>or, which is the ſame
        thing, to prove a <lb/>point of <hi rend="italic">Revelation,</hi> he quotes a Paſſage

        <lb/>No Perſon can poſſibly imagine a Caſe of that <lb/>Nature ſhould never happen to me in

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Upon my giving an Account of having <lb/>with my Finger dilated and caſt

        it is my conſtant Practice to paſs my <lb/>Hand immediately after the Birth, in order to
        <lb/>extract the <hi rend="italic">Placenta;</hi> he enquires what there is <lb/>ſo
        extraordinary in it, that it deſerves to be <lb/>noted ſo emphatically, <hi rend="italic">as
          my conſtant Practice <lb/>is?</hi> And then asks if Madam <hi rend="italic">Du

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>As for Madam <hi rend="italic">Du Tertre</hi> and myſelf being <lb/>of

          >Diſadvan-</w><lb/><w part="F">tage</w>, ſince what is <hi rend="italic">right</hi> in
        Madam <hi rend="italic">Du Tertre</hi>

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>To return; <hi rend="italic">Pag.</hi> 47. After repeating what <lb/>I
        have ſaid in relation to the Folly of dipping <pb xml:id="page_28" n="29"/><lb/>the Infant's
        Hand, when hanging out of the <lb/>Womb, in cold Water, rubbing it with Ice, <lb/>or
        touching it with a wet Cloth, which ſome <lb/>ignorant Midwives practiſe, he deſires to be
        <lb/>inform'd, <q rend="quotes">how many Midwives I have ever <lb/>known guilty of theſe
          Fooleries?</q> I anſwer <lb/>too many; and it is probable, had Mr. <hi rend="italic"
          >Douglaſs</hi>
        <lb/>long practiſed the Art of Midwifery, he would <lb/>have, met with the ſame. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>A much greater Inſtance, of his being but <lb/>little converſant in this
        Art, he gives us in the <lb/>very next Page, where, upon my ſaying that <lb/>few Midwives
        are ſufficiently appriz'd of the <lb/>unhappy Symptom there mention'd, <hi rend="italic"
          >viz.</hi> a <lb/>violent <hi rend="italic">Flooding,</hi> he declares, that he differs
        <lb/>ſo far from me, in this Aſſertion, that, in <lb/>his Opinion, there is not <hi
          rend="italic">one</hi> Midwife in a <lb/><hi rend="italic">thouſand</hi> who knows not,
        that a violent <w part="I">Flood-</w><lb/><w part="F">ing</w> will either occaſion Abortion
        or Death. <lb/>I confeſs few, if any Midwives, can be ſo <lb/>totally ignorant, as not to
        know that <hi rend="italic">Flooding</hi>
        <lb/>will occaſion Death if no Stop be put to its <lb/>Fury. Yet many are apt to flatter
        themſelves, <lb/>that the Sufferer may be deliver'd by her <lb/>natural Pains, till it is
        too late, as appears <lb/>from ſeveral Caſes I have cited (few to what I <lb/>could have
        given) which ſhews they were not <lb/>ſufficiently appriz'd of the Danger. And I <lb/>hope I
        may be excuſed being ſo full on <lb/>this Head, as many have been before me, <lb/>ſince it
        is a Thing of ſuch vaſt Conſequence <lb/>in <hi rend="italic">Practice.</hi>
      </p>
      <pb xml:id="page_29" n="30"/>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>But to return back to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Douglaſs</hi>'s <w part="I"
          >Ob-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſervation</w> in relation to what I advanc'd about <lb/>the <hi
          rend="italic">Navel-ſtring, Pag.</hi> 48. I thought it proper <lb/>to mention what I have
        there ſaid, as I had <lb/>very often found the leaving ſo much of the <lb/>String to be a
        common Practice, and indeed the <lb/>Cuſtom, of moſt Midwives in the Country. I <lb/>never
        once mention'd it as a <hi rend="italic">Secret;</hi> ſo the <lb/><hi rend="sc">Fuss</hi>
        about it, as he <hi rend="italic">elegantly</hi> words it, is with <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >himſelf.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Again, as to his Quere, whether it is not <lb/>every Body's Practice to
        paſs their Hand <lb/>immediately and examine if there are any <lb/>more Children, and if no
        more, to fetch the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Placenta?</hi> I anſwer No; not even among
        <lb/>the Aſſiſtants of my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> Sex, much leſs <lb/>with the <hi
          rend="italic">Women,</hi> for I aſſert that few of them <lb/>take this Method. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Few Midwives, even in this <hi rend="italic">Town,</hi> paſs their

        <w part="I">Declara-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion</w>, and my own <hi rend="italic"
          >Experience</hi>) and fewer yet <lb/>in the Country. So that the Woman in whoſe <lb/>Caſe
        this is mention'd had really ſtood but a <lb/>bad Chance; had an ignorant Midwife been
        <lb/>call'd in upon her, as I have there affirm'd. Here <lb/>Mr. <hi rend="italic"
          >Douglaſs</hi> has certainly burnt his Fingers, <lb/>and taken hold of one of the beſt
        Obſervations <lb/>in my whole Book; which may ſerve to ſhew <lb/>his extraordinary <hi
          rend="italic">Judgment.</hi> That few <w part="I">Mid-</w><lb/><w part="F">wives</w> in
        this Town do paſs their Hand is an <pb xml:id="page_30" n="31"/><lb/>Affirmation I dare
        ſubmit to the Chief of the <lb/>Profeſſion. Pray whence comes it that we are <lb/>ſo often
        ſent for to extract the <hi rend="italic">Placenta?</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>Is not what I have wrote on this Subject <lb/>Matter of <hi

          >fore</w> as it is againſt my own Intereſt, it muſt <lb/>be judg'd to be <hi rend="italic"

      <p rend="indent"><lb/>If I have written any thing that will not <lb/>ſtand the Teſt, but that
        my <hi rend="italic">Herculean</hi>
        <w part="I">Anta-</w><lb/><w part="F">goniſt</w> does not pretend to, why do not proper
        <lb/>Judges diſprove me? If nothing but what will <lb/>ſtand the Trial, why muſt I be loaded

          rend="italic">Teeth,</hi> yet cannot <lb/><hi rend="italic">bite;</hi> and I at once
        deſpiſe and pity ſuch a <lb/>Perſon. </p>
      <p rend="indent"><lb/>All Midwives are not <hi rend="italic">Du Tertre</hi>'s; and why <lb/>I
        ſhould not ſay, <hi rend="italic">this is my conſtant Practice,</hi>

          >ſug-</w><lb/><w part="F">geſted</w> a Cenſure from this.) How wrongfully <lb/>then does
        he accuſe me of having condemn'd <lb/>the Midwives unjuſtly, becauſe I affirm, that if
        <lb/>an ignorant Midwife had been concern'd in the <lb/>Caſe abovementioned, who had only
        taken the <lb/>firſt Child and After-birth, the laſt would <w part="I">pro-</w><pb

        ill, and <w part="I">ex-</w><lb/><w part="F">treamly</w> weak, it would very likely have
        coſt <lb/>her her Life? Is not what I have ſaid <hi rend="italic">true?</hi>
        <lb/>Can what is here ſpoken, of an <hi rend="italic">ignorant</hi>
        <w part="I">Mid-</w><lb/><w part="F">wife</w>, belong to a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> one?

        the Misfortune I there <w part="I">men-</w><lb/><w part="F">tion?</w> For I ſay again, that

          <hi rend="italic">viz. That, guilty or not guilty, 'tis all <lb/>one,</hi> I muſt be <hi

        <lb/>be perſuaded to have it taken away) between <lb/>the fourth and fifth Month, and yet
