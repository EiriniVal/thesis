                        <lb/>certainly almoſt co-eval with mankind. <lb/>The firſt midwife, of whom
                        mention is <lb/>made under that name, aſſiſted at the <lb/>ſecond labour of
                        Rachel, the wife of <lb/>Jacob; another midwife is ſpoken of in
                        <lb/>Geneſis, at the lying-in of Thamar, who <lb/>was delivered of twins.
                        But the moſt <lb/>honourable mention of midwives, is <lb/>that in Exodus,
                        when Pharoah, King of <lb/>Egypt, who had a mind to deſtroy the

                        Phanerte, the mother of <lb/>Socrates was a midwife: Plato ſpeaks at

                    <lb/>as ſoon as ſhe diſcovers any ſymptoms of <lb/>labour. The examination by
                    the touch, <lb/>or what is called trying a pain, is to be <lb/>made in as
                    private a manner as poſſible: <lb/>the patient ſhould lie on the bed, on her

                    touch is, by <lb/>introducing one finger, dipt in pomatum, <lb/>into the vagina,

                    it; and, in the time <lb/>of a pain, you will find the membranes <lb/>which
                    contain the waters, protruding like <lb/>a ſmall bladder through the dilatation. </p>
                <pb n="31"/>
                <p rend="indent"><lb/>The beſt reaſon for ſtaying with her now, <lb/>is to keep her

                    heat her, and might <lb/>produce a fever, which would not only <lb/>retard her
                    labour, but make a good <w part="I">reco-</w><lb/><w part="F">very</w> doubtful.
                    If the membranes break <lb/>before the pains come on, you need not <lb/>expect
                    the child to advance till the waters <lb/>are diſcharged, and you may ſafely
                    leave <lb/>the buſineſs to nature for ſome time; after <lb/>the waters, there
                    comes from the uterus a <lb/>ſlimy mucus, ſometimes tinged with blood; <lb/>and
                    it is generally a preſage of a favourable <lb/>labour, for it proves the patient
                    relaxed, <lb/>and conduces to make the labour eaſy, by <lb/>lubricating the
                    paſſage: we do not find this <lb/>mucus in every labour, and where it is
                    <lb/>wanting after the diſcharge of the waters, <lb/>we term it a dry labour,

                    <lb/>Sometimes the head of the child plugs up <lb/>the water, ſo that but a
                    ſmall portion of it <lb/>comes away when the membranes break; <lb/>and when the

                    our guide; the <lb/>vertex is the beſt preſentation. As the <lb/>uterus

                    would <lb/>not the hand be too great an addition to the <lb/>head, already,

                    In this caſe, I <lb/>have always found the following method to <lb/>anſwer; I

                    much the ſame; <lb/>firſt preſs gently upon the ribs, with both <lb/>your hands

                    theſe are the only <lb/>things I know to be of uſe for its recovery. <lb/>Be not

                <p rend="indent"><lb/>When the <hi rend="italic">face preſents</hi>, it is the

                <p rend="indent"><lb/>A robuſt woman about thirty-five years <lb/>of age was taken

                    <lb/>and conſtitution; the os uteri a little dilated, <lb/>the head preſenting
                    fair, and the water <lb/>beginning to protrude: the parts were <lb/>rigid, but
                    her ſtrength was great, and the <lb/>capacity of the pelvis, which was by no
                    <lb/>means too confined, gave me every reaſon <lb/>to look for a favourable
                    iſſue; I gave an <lb/>injection, and likewiſe a ſpoonful of caſtor <lb/>oil, to
                    clear her upper as well as lower <lb/>paſſages. I ſtayed with her all night, to
                    <lb/>prevent her taking any ſtrong drink, by <lb/>the perſuaſion of the few
                    ignorant women <lb/>I found with her; the membranes broke at <lb/>ſeven in the

                    <lb/>the diſcharge of the water: there was no <lb/>mucus diſcharged from the
                    uterus to <w part="I">lubri-</w><lb/><w part="F">cate</w> the parts, but this
                    defect I ſupplied <lb/>occaſionally by a little pomatum. I was <lb/>under no

                    <lb/>labour, as I at the beginning expected. <lb/>She had an old maiden ſiſter

                    unhappy that ſhe was not delivered, <lb/>and about two o'clock the huſband came
                    <lb/>into the room, and told me he had reaſon <lb/>to think his wife would need
                    a doctor; I <lb/>anſwered, that I saw no occaſion for a <lb/>doctor, but if he
                    or his friends were uneaſy, <lb/>and wiſhed for one, I would not urge the

                    and ſhe anſwered <lb/>in the negative. </p>
                <p rend="indent"><lb/>About four o'clock the drowſy period of <lb/>the labour came

                    to which <lb/>ſhe ſeemed very much diſpoſed; but they <lb/>ſeemed ſo very

                    for his experience. In a little <lb/>time I was informed a doctor was come, and
                    <lb/>wanted to ſee me; he turned out to be the <lb/>perſon I mentioned, and I
                    told him the <lb/>progreſs of the labour from its <w part="I"
                        >commence-</w><lb/><w part="F">ment</w>; that I knew there was not the leaſt

                    waters, being plugged by the head, <lb/>were now diſtilling in ſmall quantities
                    with <lb/>every pain; and as I expected no more <lb/>than a verdict from him,
                    which I thought <lb/>would ſatisfy the friends, I did not object <lb/>to his
                    ſeeing the woman. He accordingly <lb/>came, and enquired into her ſituation,
                    felt <lb/>her pulſe, told her ſhe would do very well, <lb/>for ſhe had a good
                    ſtrong pulſe, that could <lb/>bear any thing, but he would leave her <lb/>then,
                    and return in about an hour's time. <lb/>He was better than his promiſe, for he
                    <lb/>returned in half the time, furniſhed with <pb n="58"/><lb/>his tools; he
                    took his ſeat, and whiſpered <lb/>to me, who ſat cloſe by him, that he was
                    <lb/>going to apply the <hi rend="italic">lever</hi>. I anſwered, if he
                    <lb/>took the labour in his own hands, he might <lb/>act as he pleaſed. He
                    introduced the <w part="I">in-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſtrument</w>, but withdrew it
                    again immediately, <lb/>without making any effort to deliver; he <lb/>then told

                    <lb/>they often made uſe of, and which were <lb/>very ſafe. I was exceedingly

                    effort, the head was <lb/>brought forth, and the body ſoon followed, <lb/>with a
                    ſanguinary hue all over, as it had <pb n="59"/><lb/>fallen into a butcher's tub
                    in the <w part="I">ſlaughter-</w><lb/><w part="F">houſe</w>. It diſcovered no

                    ſubſided, and the doctor made <lb/>various trials to recover it; he then gave
                    <lb/>it to me, to try what I could do, while <lb/>he brought the placenta, and
                    upon wiping <lb/>its head and face, I diſcovered a deep <lb/>wound upon the
                    right temple, which <w part="I">ap-</w><lb/><w part="F">peared</w> to me to be
                    evidently the cauſe <lb/>of the child's death, becauſe it was in the
                    <lb/>direction of the temple vein; but as the <lb/>doctor was young, and of
                    courſe his <w part="I">cha-</w><lb/><w part="F">racter</w> delicate, I
                    endeavoured to veil this <lb/>misfortune, by drawing the lips of the <lb/>wound
                    cloſe together, and keeping my <lb/>finger upon it, 'till the blood dried to <w
                        part="I">pre-</w><lb/><w part="F">vent</w> it from opening. As the goſſips
                    were <lb/>engaged about the woman, who was all this <lb/>time flooding, I had
                    abundant opportunity of <lb/>managing this buſineſs, and of waſhing the
                    <lb/>poor infant, and laying it out; when I was <lb/>thus employed, the doctor
                    came to me, <lb/>and whiſpered me to put a cap on it: he ran <lb/>to the baſket,
                    and brought me one. I took <lb/>the hint, and pinned it cloſe over the face <pb
                        n="60"/><lb/>to hide the cut; and I now declare before <lb/><hi
                        rend="italic">God</hi>, that I could not have been more <lb/>careful to
                    conceal this miſfortune, if it had <lb/>happened in my own hands. The doctor's
                    <lb/>ſentiments of generoſity were very different <lb/>from mine, for when, on
                    his firſt viſit, the <lb/>parents regretted very <hi rend="italic">much</hi> the
                    child's <lb/>death; he ſaid <q rend="quotes diple">as to that, the child was
                        <lb/>dead four hours before he was called;</q>
                    <lb/>this was a groſs falſehood, and I leave any <lb/>practitioner to judge,
                    whether a <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> labour <lb/>of twenty-four hours could
                    prove fatal to <lb/>a child: beſides the pulſation in the <w part="I"
                        >navel-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſtring</w> was a clear proof that it was not
                    <lb/>quite dead when born, otherwiſe to what <lb/>purpoſe did he make any
                    efforts to reſtore <lb/>it to life, and requeſt me to try what I <lb/>could do
                    for it. I firmly believe, he was <lb/>not then conſcious of the injury it had
                    <lb/>received by the inſtrument, for it was all <lb/>over ſo covered with blood,
                    that he could <lb/>not ſee the cut while it was on his lap; <lb/>nor could I,
                    till I wiped its poor head and <lb/>face with a cloth: however, this <w part="I"
                        >miſrepre-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſentation</w> of the caſe anſwered his

                    me, and he became the minion of <lb/>this little Plebian family, while I was
                    inſulted <lb/>by them, and ſuſpected of an evil in which <lb/>I had no hand, but
                    that of having ſuffered <lb/>a young unexperienced man to avail himſelf <lb/>of
                    an opportunity, which then offered, of <lb/>trying experiments on a midwife's

                    his conduct) <lb/>that he thought the death of the child, and <lb/>the
                    appearance of it when brought forth, <lb/>was owing to the ſeparation of ſome

                <p rend="indent"><lb/>I muſt again remind you, that in moſt <lb/>difficult labours,

                    advancing beyond a <lb/>certain length; and when he has dilated <lb/>the os

                    <lb/>prevent wounding of the mother: when the <lb/>brain is evacuated, he takes
                    hold of the <lb/>remaining part of the ſkull with his fingers, <lb/>or with the
                    blunt hook, to draw it forth; <lb/>one hand is in the vagina, and held faſt

                <p rend="indent"><lb/>But if the head be ſo large in proportion <lb/>to the pelvis,
                    that the child cannot be <lb/>brought forth by theſe helps, the operator
                    <lb/>endeavours to get firmer hold with the <lb/>crotchet in the mouth, or under
                    the chin, <pb n="76"/><lb/>or in ſome part of the baſe of the ſkull,

                    opening the head, left the <lb/>patient for ſeveral hours, before they have
                    <lb/>delivered her, as in that time the child is <lb/>ſuppoſed to turn more

                    have flattened the head with the <lb/>forceps, and extracted it before they have

                        where I have attended, was that <lb/>of a lady, who was then at her country
                        <lb/>ſeat thirteen miles from town, and was <lb/>ſeized with a flooding in
                        the ſeventh month. <lb/>I was ſent for, but before my arrival, the
                        <lb/>gentleman who practiſed midwifery in the <lb/>village had given her
                        medicines, and the <lb/>complaint did, in a great degree, ſubſide
                        <lb/>before night, when I was obliged to return <lb/>to town. As I was
                        apprehenſive ſhe would <lb/>not go to her full time, and knew ſhe was
                        <lb/>very averſe to the attendance of a man to <lb/>deliver her, I adviſed
                        her coming to town <lb/>as ſoon as ſhe could be removed with ſafety,
                        <lb/>for I could not anſwer that her labour <lb/>would not be premature, and

                        I begged the <lb/>doctor might be permitted to give every <lb/>aſſiſtance in
                        his power, as it certainly would <pb n="87"/><lb/>be carrying delicacy too
                        far, to wait till I <lb/>could come ſo many miles. But the ſeaſon
                        <lb/>proving very inviting, ſhe deferred coming <lb/>to town, and went on
                        very well till the end <lb/>of the eighth month; when, about two
                        <lb/>o'clock in the morning, ſhe waked with a <lb/>violent flooding, and I
                        was again ſent for. <lb/>On my arrival I met her huſband in a <lb/>ſtate of

                        dead. I examined by the touch, <lb/>and found the placenta totally detached

                        I told the doctor I <lb/>did not think ſhe had two hours to live, <lb/>but I
                        would endeavour to do all that could <lb/>be done, by delivering her. She
                        had not <lb/>taken one labour pain at all, and it was in <lb/>vain to look
                        for any; ſo I dilated the os <lb/>internum, ſearched for the thin edge of
                            <pb n="88"/><lb/>the placenta, perforated the membranes, <lb/>removed
                        the thick part towards the right <lb/>ſide, and found the head preſenting.
                        As <lb/>ſhe was ſo low ſhe could neither look <lb/>up or ſpeak, I thought it
                        more adviſable <lb/>to bring the child as it preſented, than to <lb/>run the

                    <lb/>active in trying to take the breaſt; added <lb/>to this, the mothers are

                    endeavouring to ſuckle lying <lb/>down in the bed, and the children ſhould

                    that quality, a gentle <lb/>purge is certainly neceſſary, and the child <lb/>has
                    this advantage, that ſuch milk is more <lb/>free, and ſucked with far leſs

                    unfortunately for <lb/>it, its piteous cries are miſconſtrued, and <lb/>a
                    prodigious quantity of pap or gruel is <lb/>poured down its throat, which lays a

                    convulſions, and <lb/>often <hi rend="italic">death</hi>. If, inſtead of this
