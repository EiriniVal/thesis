                    ſhe died the <lb/>third day after Delivery. When <lb/>dead, I perceived her
                    Belly <lb/>to be as green as graſs, being <lb/>mortified. It proceeded, as I
                    <lb/>conceive, from a great preſſure <lb/>often repeated, by the Women, <lb/>in

                    me <lb/>for it was, That all the Woman's <lb/>Pains, inſtead of Bearing down,
                    <lb/>every Pain roſe up the Child, <lb/>and ſtraiten'd her Belly, round <lb/>her
                    Navel, as tho' it would have <lb/>broke thro'. I laid my hand on <lb/>her Belly,
                    and it ſeem'd to me, <lb/>that all the ſubſtance between <pb n="20"/><lb/>the
                    Child's Head and my hand, <lb/>was not thicker than fine paper. <lb/>The Woman
                    told me, That <w part="I">af-</w><lb/><w part="F">ter</w> her Waters were gone,
                    ſhe <lb/>never had one Pain like thoſe <lb/>ſhe uſed to have of her former
                    <lb/>Children; ſhe having had ſeven <lb/>before. I eaſily perceiv'd the
                    <lb/>reaſon, when I found the Child's <lb/>Head erected as high as poſſible;
                    <lb/>for 'tis common for Children, <lb/>whilſt alive, to make the <w part="I"

                    Head lies: but after this <lb/>Child was dead, the largeneſs of <lb/>the Head
                    hindered the Pangs <lb/>being ſucceſsful, but, on the <lb/>contrary, became very
                    injurious. <lb/>I put a Tunnel in the Child's <lb/>Head, where I made the <w
                        part="I">Punc-</w><lb/><w part="F">ture</w>>, and pour'd in five full
                    <lb/>pints of water, and judg'd it <lb/>would have held half a pint <lb/>more,
                    which made the Head <pb n="21"/><lb/>prodigiouſly large, and <w part="I"
                        >impoſ-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſible</w> to be born of any woman <lb/>in the
                    world. And for want of <lb/>this Woman's being deliver'd <lb/>when her Waters
                    broke, ſhe loſt <lb/>her life: which is very plain; <lb/>for a Smith's wife, a

                    <lb/>of her's, was at that time about <lb/>twelve weeks gone with Child.
                    <lb/>She was often with the Woman, <lb/>and ſaw the Child; which was <lb/>a
                    great imbecility in her, and <lb/>ſo it is with any Woman that is <lb/>pregnant,
                    to ſee any thing that <lb/>may affect their Infants, as this <lb/>did: for two
                    months before her <lb/>Time was expired, ſhe ſent for <lb/>me, and deſir'd my

                    poſitive <lb/>her Child would be the ſame as <lb/>her deceaſed friend's. She
                    told <lb/>me ſhe was in the ſame way <pb n="22"/><lb/>as her friend; ſhe had
                    heard <lb/>her complain often, whilſt with <lb/>Child: and, indeed, it proved
                    <lb/>too true. For when I was ſent <lb/>for to her, I found her Labour, <lb/>and
                    the Situation of the Child, <lb/>and the Dropſical Head, with <lb/>every
                    particular, as the <w part="I">Inn-</w><lb/><w part="F">holder's</w> wife. As
                    ſoon as the <lb/>Waters broke, I ſearch'd for the <lb/>Feet, ſo brought the
                    Child's <lb/>Body; but was oblig'd to make <lb/>an Inciſion in the Head, as in
                    <lb/>the former Child. Her whole <lb/>time of Delivery exceeded not <lb/>an
                    hour; the Child's Head <w part="I">con-</w><lb/><w part="F">tained</w> near the
                    ſame quantity of <lb/>Water as t'other Child. She <lb/>did very well, and had
                    ſeveral <lb/>Children after: which is a plain <lb/>demonſtration, if the other
                        <w part="I">wo-</w><lb/><w part="F">man</w> had been deliver'd as ſoon
                    <lb/>as her Waters broke, (the only <lb/>time to deliver all Wrong Births) <pb

                    Uſe, <lb/>but, on the contrary, pernicious. <lb/>The poor Woman had been ſo
                    <lb/>ill uſed, that it was ſome time <lb/>before I could perſuade her to
                    <lb/>ſuffer me to Touch her, ſaying <lb/>ſhe choſe to die, rather than go
                    <lb/>through any more Pain in that <lb/>manner. I aſſur'd her, with the
                    <lb/>Omnipotent's leave, I would <w part="I">de-</w><lb/><w part="F">liver</w>
                    her in leſs than half an <lb/>hour. She then conſented I <lb/>ſhould try. I laid
                    her a-croſs <lb/>the Bed, on her Knees, with a <lb/>bolſter and pillow under her
                    <lb/>Stomach, that her Belly might <lb/>lie hollow; which I have found, <lb/>in
                    general, to be the eaſieſt and <lb/>beſt way, giving liberty for <lb/>turning a
                    Child. I Touch'd her, <lb/>and found the Child's Arm hal'd <lb/>out, as far as
                    the Shoulder, and <pb n="28"/><lb/>broke in two places. I ſlid my <lb/>hand
                    gently along the Child's <lb/>Arm and Ribs, with ſome <w part="I"
                        >diffi-</w><lb/><w part="F">culty</w>; ſo advanced further, till <lb/>I
                    found one Foot, and drew it <lb/>towards me; the other ſoon <lb/>follow'd. I
                    wrap'd them in <w part="I">lin-</w><lb/><w part="F">nen</w>, for the better
                    hold, and <lb/>deliver'd her, altho' the Child <lb/>was much ſwelld. I ſuppoſe
                    <lb/>the Infant had been dead from <lb/>the Friday before. In her <w part="I"

                    Delivery without <lb/>complaining? She told me, She <lb/>had endur'd a thouſand

                    my departure. One great <lb/>reaſon of my recollecting theſe <lb/>Obſervations,

                    Child <lb/>was dead, and the Woman in <lb/>great danger. She had been <lb/>with
                    this Woman two days and <lb/>one Night. I ſent for her, to <lb/>admoniſh her not

                    <lb/>ſearch'd for the Feet, but found <lb/>them very difficult to be come
                    <lb/>at, ſhe being a little ſhort <w part="I">Wo-</w><lb/><w part="F">man</w>,
                    and a large Child dead; <lb/>the Arm and Shoulders much <lb/>ſwell'd, which

                    But after <lb/>I had brought the Child as far <lb/>as the Knees, I was obliged

                    alive, becauſe <lb/>of the circumſtances already <lb/>given; the Mother's
                    weakneſs, <lb/>and the Child's largeneſs. But <pb n="78"/><lb/>recovering my
                    thoughts, I <w part="I">re-</w><lb/><w part="F">ſolved</w> to do my duty for the
                    <lb/>poor Woman's ſake, and leave <lb/>the event to the Omniſcient <lb/>God. I
                    was obliged to be <w part="I">ex-</w><lb/><w part="F">ceeding</w> careful and
                    ſlow, yet <lb/>reſolved with all my ſtrength, <lb/>and a full reſolution, to <w
                        part="I">accom-</w><lb/><w part="F">pliſh</w> what I was about. When <lb/>I
                    had hold of one Foot, I found <lb/>it hard work to hold it, and <lb/>draw it
                    towards me, by reaſon I <lb/>could hold it but with my two <lb/>fore-fingers at
                    firſt. However, <lb/>I kept my hold, and in a ſmall <lb/>time brought the Feet
                    out of <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Uterus</hi> (or Womb.) I brought <lb/>alſo the
                    Legs out to the Knees; <lb/>then I wrapt them in a linnen <lb/>cloth, and gave
                    them to two <lb/>ſtrong Women, and deſir'd them <lb/>to draw in a ſtrait line,
                    whilſt I <lb/>took care of the Woman's body, <pb n="79"/><lb/>to prevent any
                    injury, and <w part="I">ſe-</w><lb/><w part="F">cure</w> the Child that it might
                    be <lb/>brought off whole; which, thro' <lb/>mercy I compleated. The <hi

                    <lb/>than is common in theſe Caſes; <lb/>which, I believe, was owing to <lb/>the
                    dryneſs of the Womb from <lb/>her Fever. The Child had not <lb/>the leaſt
                    appearance of life, and <lb/>'twas impoſſible it ſhould: this <lb/>Delivery
                    being at leaſt an hour <lb/>and half's hard work, which <w part="I"
                        >ſel-</w><lb/><w part="F">dom</w> happens: for in common <lb/>wrong Births
                    it is very rarely <lb/>more than half an hour, and <w part="I">of-</w><lb/><w
