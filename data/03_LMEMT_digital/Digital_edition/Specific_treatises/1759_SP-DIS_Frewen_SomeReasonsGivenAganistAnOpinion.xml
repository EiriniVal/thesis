          inflammation, ſo that a <w part="I">ſuppu-</w><lb/><w part="F">rated</w> matter may not

          of this diſtemper, <lb/>the morbific particles, contained <lb/>therein, are received into
          the <w part="I">hu-</w><lb/><w part="F">man</w> body by inſpiration; and they <lb/>act,
          wherever they happen to fall, <lb/>by an irreſiſtable power, like fire

          which was ſuſceptible of <lb/>this contaminating taint, and ſo <lb/>propagated the

          the mode of Nature, from <lb/>this theory alone, ſeems to be too <lb/>intricate and
          perplexing for human <lb/>underſtanding; inſomuch that the <lb/>nature of the morbific

          <lb/>being generally admitted, I think <lb/>it evident, therefore, as far as it can
          <lb/>be demonſtrated from experience, <lb/>that a different manner in giving <lb/>the
          infection (I mean that of <w part="I">ino-</w><lb/><w part="F">culation)</w> manifeſtly
          produceth a <lb/>different effect. And this, I make <pb xml:id="page_34" n="29"/><lb/>not
