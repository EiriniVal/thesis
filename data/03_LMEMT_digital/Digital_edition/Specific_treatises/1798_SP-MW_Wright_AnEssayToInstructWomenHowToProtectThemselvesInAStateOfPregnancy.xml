          <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">T</hi>O a woman who never wrote more than <lb/>a common letter, it
          ſeemeth ſomewhat <lb/>awkward to take up the pen to write for public <lb/>peruſal, but my
          friends deſire that I may do it; <lb/>they have a better opinion of me, than I have
          <lb/>of myſelf; they ſay if I give nothing new to <lb/>the world, I may ſtill be uſeful to
          my own <lb/>ſex, by recommending many things familiar to <lb/>my experience, which they
          may have had few <lb/>opportunities of knowing; much experience is <lb/>not the portion of
          many young women; few <lb/>read large elaborate works, and many would be <lb/>glad to
          receive inſtruction advantageous to them- <lb/>ſelves and their families, from a ſmall
          pam- <lb/>phlet; they have many occupations, and care <lb/>not to torment themſelves with
          technical terms <lb/>in languages unknown to them, or toil over <lb/>hundreds of pages
          they do not underſtand; my <lb/>greateſt anxiety ſhall be to be plain and eaſily com-
          <lb/>prehended. Some females aſcend into the paths <pb xml:id="page_3" n="ii"/>
          <lb/>of literature, by accident, genius, or induſtry; <lb/>to the firſt and laſt I am
          indebted, but as to <lb/>the ſecond, alas, I have few pretenſions; all <lb/>I can boaſt
          of, is, much good temper, patience, <lb/>and a tolerable ſhare of common ſenſe. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>If this little Eſſay ſhould make its way to <lb/>the hands of a learned critic, it is
          not improba- <lb/>ble, that after reading the title page, and ſeeing <lb/>it comes from a
          midwife, he may throw it <lb/>aſide with diſdain, ſuppoſing it ſmells too ſtrong <lb/>of
          gruel, caudle, and the ſlops of the nurſery, <lb/>and ſo I may eſcape a ſcourging from
          him; but <lb/>another, after ſome inveſtigation, may tell us <lb/>that this obſtetric dame
          might have employed <lb/>herſelf better with her needle; a third, with <lb/>as much good
          nature, and full as much ſci- <lb/>ence, may kindly invite her into the field of
          <lb/>literature, hoping that a little more ſtudy may <lb/>enable her to correct her
          deficiencies, and I <lb/>will bend to him with obedience and the loweſt <pb
            xml:id="page_4" n="iii"/>
          <lb/>courteſy of my acknowledgment for his gen- <lb/>tleness and liberality. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The intention of this Eſſay is, to convey <lb/>to my amiable country-women ſome hints
          <lb/>or inſtructions how to preſerve themſelves <lb/>in pregnancy from evils that often
          torment or <lb/>deſtroy them, and from which a little rational <lb/>inſtruction may ſtand
          as it were like a beacon, <lb/>to point out latent evil; and I have the vanity <lb/>to
          hope that my humble attempts to be uſeful, <lb/>will neither be neglected nor loſt.
          Another <lb/>part of my intention is, as a tender mother <lb/>myſelf, to teach others who
          have leſs experi- <lb/>ence, how to ſuperintend their infant offspring. <lb/>This is an
          important concern, for it is a me- <lb/>lancholy truth, that above half the human
          <lb/>race ſuffer much, or ſink into untimely graves, <lb/>before they are two or three
          years old; nor is <lb/>it unlikely, that many of theſe infants are in- <lb/>jured by the
          ignorance or careleſſneſs of perſons <lb/>employed to look after them; perhaps in my <pb
            xml:id="page_5" n="iv"/>
          <lb/>way through this little tract I may touch on the <lb/>office or duty of a midwife,
          and other articles <lb/>in a miſcellaneous manner. On ſexual diſor- <lb/>ders it was my
          intention to have expoſed the <lb/>futility of what is often done, and how to ſub-
          <lb/>ſtitute ſome things more effectual; but I find <lb/>myſelf incapable of writing
          publicly on this <lb/>branch of feminine infirmities, without violat- <lb/>ing in ſome
          degree, my own ſenſe of delicacy <lb/>and modeſty, but to make up for this, it is my
          <lb/>intention henceforward, to act as a midwife, <lb/>and to give advice, and even
          particular me- <lb/>dicines, in all diſeaſes of women and children, <lb/>to all who may do
          me the honour to employ me; <lb/>whenever I may be puzzled, (the moſt able are
          <lb/>non-pluſſed ſometimes though they may not <lb/>own it) it is my determination to
          apply for <lb/>help, to ſome of my friends, phyſicians of <lb/>learning and much
          experience, that will readily <lb/>give me their beſt advice. </p>
        <pb xml:id="page_6" n="v"/>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The diſeaſes of children are numerous, and <lb/>require the moſt careful examination.
          I have <lb/>ſtudied them much on pathological prin- <lb/>ciples, and though I have not
          conſumed much <lb/>of the midnight oil, have been ſucceſſful in <lb/>removing them. That
          diſmal train of evils <lb/>that depends on worms bred in the inteſtines <lb/>of children,
          and frequently of grown up per- <lb/>ſons, may commonly be removed by proper
          <lb/>attention. I pretend not to the poſſeſſion of <lb/>infallible noſtrums, nor would I
          practiſe on <lb/>dogmatical principles, for then we can have <lb/>no clue to cauſes, nor
          could we have occaſion <lb/>for reaſon or education; a few recipes without <lb/>knowledge,
          would in this caſe be ſufficient <lb/>to cure diſeaſes; on this plan, a perſon who
          <lb/>knows the names of the ropes and ſails may <lb/>go to ſea, but, without the art of
          navigation, <lb/>he would ſeldom carry a ſhip ſafe to her port. </p>

        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>It may be ſuppoſed I am no great theoriſt, <lb/>yet I am not altogether ignorant of
          pathology, <lb/>or the difference in diſtempers, or of their <lb/>cauſes and effects. I
          have practiſed much <lb/>among poor people, gratis, on the Continent <lb/>and at home,
          giving them their medicines, be- <lb/>cauſe, I think it a duty on all to do good, and
          <lb/>my intentions have been anſwered with general <lb/>ſucceſs. It is my intention ſtill
          to carry on <lb/>this eleemoſynary practice, with this differ- <lb/>ence, that in London,
          I cannot afford to fur- <lb/>niſh remedies for all that may want them, but, <lb/>if female
          paupers will call Sundays and Thurs- <lb/>days, in the morning, from 8 to 10 o'clock,
          <lb/>they ſhall be welcome to my beſt endeavours <lb/>to ſerve them. If they are ſober,
          and obe- <lb/>dient to directions, I will ſometimes give them <lb/>medicines, and I ſhall
          never be wanting to <lb/>their welfare; if not, they muſt not be ſur- <lb/>priſed, if I
          excuſe myſelf from hearing their <lb/>complaints. </p>

          <lb/>If any perſon who never heard of me before, <lb/>ſhould have any inclination to
          employ me, <lb/>they may naturally wiſh to know who I am, <lb/>and to know my character; I
          ſhall only hope <lb/>to be known, my vouchers are neither obſcure <lb/>or unworthy of
          notice; I may venture to ſay <lb/>this for myſelf, my friends all ſay it of me,
          <lb/>though no ſycophant, I never yet made a foe, <lb/>or loſt a friend. It may be
          objected to my <lb/>propoſals, that this Eſſay may be regarded as <lb/>a quack
          advertiſement; I feel, and I dread <lb/>the force of ſuch a charge, but I am neither
          <lb/>a boaſter, nor a vain pretender, this truth may <lb/>be eaſily made evident. I may,
          after ſix years <lb/>reſidence, call myſelf a ſtranger in this great <lb/>city, for I am
          very little known, only to a <lb/>few friends of the middle rank, who cannot <lb/>ſtep
          beyond their line to recommend me, and <lb/>I may remain in obſcurity, were I now to ſup-

          conſtitutionally afflicted with <lb/>troubleſome complaints in the firſt months of preg-
          <lb/>nancy. The moſt common ſymptoms of breeding <lb/>are, ſickneſs, loathing, vomiting,
          giddineſs, drowſi- <lb/>neſs, heartburn, diarrhœa, a painful fulneſs of the <lb/>breaſts,
          nervous fits, faintings, &amp;c. If the patient <lb/>is healthy, or of a full habit, it
          may be uſeful for <lb/>her to let blood repeatedly, in ſmall quantities, not
          <lb/>exceeding ſix or ſeven ounces at a time, eſpecially <lb/>if the ſickneſs is attended
          with fluſhings, parched <lb/>mouth, or any other feveriſh ſymptoms; larger
          <lb/>evacuations are not ſafe. The bowels in ſuch caſes <lb/>ought to be kept ſoluble by
          ripe fruits, cooling <lb/>diet, magneſia, cream of tartar whey, ſoluble tar- <pb

          <lb/>tar, manna, or ſuch gentle things, and yet more <lb/>advantageouſly by oily or
          emollient clyſters; an <lb/>uſeful domeſtic injection may be made in a few <lb/>minutes
          thus:—Take of ſtrained gruel, about <lb/>three quarters of a pint, brown ſugar, one ounce,
          <lb/>Caſtile ſoap, half an ounce, ſalad oil, two ounces; <lb/>this, or ſomething like it,
          may be thrown up <lb/>occaſionally. If frights or falls have done harm, <lb/>the ſame
          treatment is recommended. When <lb/>vomiting is troubleſome, I have frequently known
          <lb/>this ſymptom carried off by drinking chamomile <lb/>tea, or giving two or three
          grains of ipeca- <lb/>cuanha, to cauſe a diſcharge of the offending matter <lb/>from the
          ſtomach. It may be remembered, as a <lb/>general rule, that all ſtrong or violent remedies
          are <lb/>hurtful, therefore, we caution againſt antimonials, <lb/>mercurials, cathartics,
          jalap, aloes, or even rhubarb, <lb/>becauſe it often cauſes griping pains. When ner-
          <lb/>vous complaints come on, the moſt effectual relief <lb/>may be obtained from gentle
          opiates. If the pa- <lb/>tient is delicate or weak, bleeding may do harm; <lb/>but an

        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>THE diſeaſes of advanced pregnancy ought to be <lb/>well underſtood by every midwife;
          for if ill treated, <lb/>may be attended with the worſt conſequences. As <lb/>pregnancy
          advances, the uterus increaſes in ſize, <lb/>and preſſes more and more heavily on the
          bowels, <lb/>by which their important functions are impaired, <lb/>the circulation of the
          blood, and the nervous in- <lb/>fluence, are materially obſtructed, what wonder <lb/>then
          if diſagreeable effects often come from ſuch <lb/>cauſes? </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Let us now mention ſome of the complaints that <lb/>take place, and the beſt means of
          removing them. <lb/>When the gravid uterus riſes higher up into the <lb/>abdomen, in the
          fifth, ſixth, or ſeventh month of <lb/>pregnancy, then commonly commences the com-
          <lb/>plaints of advanced pregnancy, ſuch as colics, <lb/>cramps, hyſteric fits, pains in
          the back, difficulty of <lb/>breathing, œdematous or watery ſwelling of the <pb
            xml:id="page_14" n="13"/>
          <lb/>legs, &amp;c. vomitings, convulſions, difficulty or ſup- <lb/>preſſion of urine,
          micturition, haemorrhoids, varicous <lb/>ſwellings in the veins of the legs, beſides ſome
          others <lb/>we ſhall not mention. If colic torments the patient, <lb/>let her have the
          inteſtines moderately emptied by <lb/>gentle laxatives, lubricating clyſters, or blood-
          <lb/>letting, according to circumſtances, in caſe ſhe is <lb/>ſtrong or feveriſh, and
          coſtiveneſs ought to be <lb/>guarded againſt. If cramps are frequent, the ſame
          <lb/>treatment may be uſeful; if they are ſlight, we <lb/>have frequently known walking
          barefooted on the <lb/>cold floor to give ſpeedy relief; when more uneaſy, <lb/>the
          following liniment will afford caſe: take of <lb/>tincture of opium, one ounce, of
          camphorated <lb/>ſpirit of wine, ſix drams, oil of amber, two drams, <lb/>ſpirit of
          ammonia, four drams, mix them, and let <lb/>ſome of it be well rubbed occaſionally on the
          parts <lb/>affected. If piles are painful, the body muſt be <lb/>kept open as above, but
          we recommend caſtor oil, if <lb/>not offenſive, for this purpoſe, one or two ſpoonsful
          <lb/>is a moderate doſe; if the haemorrhoids are very un- <lb/>eaſy, we recommend ſtrongly
          the following mixture <lb/>and ointment: take of balſam capivi, two drams, <lb/>mucilage
          of gum arabic, one ounce, tincture of <pb xml:id="page_15" n="14"/>
          <lb/>columbo root, one ounce, ſimple cinnamon water, <lb/>two ounces, ſirup of ginger, one
          ounce, mix them <lb/>and give a deſert ſpoonful thrice a day. The oint- <lb/>ment may be
          depended on: take of gall nuts in <lb/>fine powder, one ounce, pure verdigriſe powdered,
          <lb/>two drams, hog's lard, two ounces, mix them to <lb/>make an ointment, which may be
          applied to the <lb/>ſwelled parts occaſionally. When great difficulty of <lb/>breathing
          attacks the patient, great relief may be <lb/>procured from bleedings, and keeping the
          body <lb/>ſoluble. When a dropſy of the whole body, called <lb/>anaſarca, comes on, it may
          proceed from laxity, <lb/>and ought if poſſible to be removed, without loſs of <lb/>time;
          we have little experience of this complaint, <lb/>it ſeldom occurs, yet we have heard
          much, but we <lb/>believe that a ſtrengthening and warm ſtimulating <lb/>diet is uſeful,
          with generous wine, but ſpirits, watery <lb/>meats, or fluids, are hurtful; after a ſafe
          delivery, <lb/>much may be done. If the fluor albus comes <lb/>on, the ſame mode of
          treatment as in the dropſy <lb/>may be recommended. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The oedematous, or watery ſwellings of the lower <lb/>extremities, ſeldom come from
          the ſame cauſe as the <pb xml:id="page_16" n="15"/>
          <lb/>general dropſy, but entirely from the preſture of the <lb/>gravid uterus, and though
          they are of little im- <lb/>portance, yet it may be proper to diminiſh them, <lb/>by
          bleeding, laxatives, a ſpare opening diet, friction, <lb/>and a horizontal poſture. If the
          patient is weakly, <lb/>cordials and a comfortable diet may be uſeful. <lb/>Delivery
          contributes more than any thing to the <lb/>cure. When varicous or diſtended ſwellings of
          the <lb/>veins become large and painful, they may be made <lb/>eaſier, by taking away
          occaſionally ſmall quantities <lb/>of blood from the arm, and keeping the body open,
          <lb/>becauſe they come from the preſſure of the gravid <lb/>uterus. The beſt application
          to the parts is a <lb/>ſtyptic or aſtringent water, which a venerable phyſi- <lb/>cian of
          great experience aſſures me is often very <lb/>uſeful in varicous dilatations: take of
          blue vitriol <lb/>and alum, of each three ounces, of water, two pints, <lb/>boil them till
          the ſalts are diſſolved, then filter the <lb/>liquor, and add one ounce and a half of the
          vitriolic <lb/>acid, and two drams of pure or refined verdigriſe, <lb/>lay on the ſwelled
          veins compreſſes of linen, and <lb/>bind them on with a tightiſh roller, and keep theſe
          <lb/>compreſſes conſtantly moiſt with this ſolution. </p>
        <pb xml:id="page_17" n="16"/>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>We have ſtrongly recommended the frequent uſe <lb/>of injections, to keep the body
          ſoluble, and if we <lb/>could perſuade thoſe for whom this little Eſſay is <lb/>intended,

          <lb/>HERE we will offer a few remarks on the quali- <lb/>fications neceſſary for an
          accoucheur, or rather let <lb/>me deſcribe the ſort of accoucheur I would recom-
          <lb/>mend. A man-midwife ought to be not younger <lb/>than forty, not talkative,
          poſſeſſing much ſagacity <lb/>and prudence, naturally modeſt, benevolent and <lb/>humane;
          in ſhort, a gentleman, and withal have <lb/>the reputation of being well educated. A
          midwife <lb/>ought to be turned of thirty, clean, and neat <lb/>in her perſon, pleaſant in
          her manners, gentle, at- <lb/>tentive, and kind to her patients, by ſupporting <lb/>their
          ſpirits in diſtreſs, civil to ſervants, but no- <lb/>thing of a goſſip, healthy and
          active, never taking <lb/>ſnuff, fond of children, skilful and tender in <lb/>handling new
          born infants, capable and ready to <lb/>teach awkward nurſes how to dreſs or clean
          <lb/>them, qualified to write ſafe and uſeful preſcriptions <lb/>for a morbid mother, or
          an ailing child; ſhe ought <pb xml:id="page_19" n="18"/>
          <lb/>to be a woman that hath been well inſtructed, that <lb/>hath had much practice, not
          conceited, nor proud, <lb/>nor vain, nor ſuperſtitious, but firm in her mind, <lb/>plain,
          diſcreet, and honeſt; a ſincere friend in <lb/>every family, always diſpoſed to call in to
          her <lb/>aſſiſtance a phyſician, or an experienced accoucheur, <lb/>whenever there is any
          neceſſity, or even a diſtant <lb/>deſire of ſome kind relation, for this will raiſe her
          <lb/>reputation, prevent reflections, and demonſtrate <lb/>her diſcretion. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The faſhion of latter years hath taken the practice <lb/>of midwifery almoſt entirely
          out of the hands of <lb/>women, and placed it into thoſe of the men, and <lb/>the reaſons
          for it were obvious. Formerly every <lb/>conceited goſſiping woman that choſe to act as a
          <lb/>midwife, began this profeſſion, without inſtruction, <lb/>I had almoſt ſaid without
          common ſenſe, or any <lb/>one requiſite for ſuch an important employment, and <lb/>many
          notorious evils enſued. Then the phyſicians <lb/>and ſurgeons, being men skilled in
          phyſiology, reſcued <lb/>many unfortunate patients from the fangs of igno- <lb/>rant
          women, and it becoming a lucrative branch of <lb/>buſineſs, they kept it ſnug, till a
          numerous body in <pb xml:id="page_20" n="19"/>
          <lb/>the inferior departments, deſiring to ſhare the pro- <lb/>fits, came forth, like a
          hord of hungry untaught <lb/>men, from the labours of the peſtle and mortar, <lb/>with a
          few hooks, forceps and crotchets, in a bag, <lb/>like Dr. Slop, they call themſelves
          accoucheurs, or <lb/>men-midwives, but for obſtetric knowledge, we <lb/>have ſeen ſome of
          them as ignorant as meſſengers of <lb/>the contents of their diſpatches, yet ſome of theſe
          <lb/>men have arrived at eminence, or rather have ac- <lb/>quired extenſive practice and
          fortunes, but in caſes <lb/>of difficulty, they are as awkward as any of the moſt
          <lb/>ignorant female practitioners. Women often em- <lb/>ploy men to act as midwives, from

            <lb/>Compariſon of an Accoucheur with a Midwife. </head>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/> I. The adroit accoucheur is a perſon that can foreſee and often prevent all the
            evils of difficult labours, with as little hurry or un- <lb/>neceſſary delay as
            poſſible, and to aſſiſt, can ſometimes uſe the forceps, or other inſtruments contrived
            to re- <lb/>move the obſtructions to delivery. 
              <lb/><cb/>I. The inſtructed accou- <lb/>cheuſe is one who is not ignorant of all the
              natural or preternatural cauſes of danger that can happen, nor of the means of
              removing them, yet never uſeth any artificial inſtrument; but in preternatural caſes,
              when patience and the hopes of parturition are loſt in fruit- <lb/>less endeavours,
              before it is too late, ſhe calls in an approved accoucheur, to aſſiſt her. 
          
              <lb/><hi rend="italic">N. B.</hi> It is a certain truth, that inſtruments, the
              catheter excepted, are very ſeldom wanted, perhaps ſel- <lb/>domer than they are uſed. 
            <pb xml:id="page_22" n="21"/> II. 
              <lb/>The uninſtructed accou- <lb/>cheur is commonly in too great a hurry to exhibit
              his dexterity in uſing his iron inſtruments, and thereby often doth miſchief, it would
              be horrible to relate. 
          
              <lb/>☞ The moſt intelligent of the faculty ſeldom or ne- <lb/>ver uſe inſtruments.
             III. The accoucheur in great practice cannot in lingering labours afford to loſe ſo
            much of his time in waiting for ſlow operations of na- <lb/>ture, therefore hurries on
            delivery, or leaves the pa- <lb/>tient till he can call again, when he can find time,
            par- <lb/>ticularly if his patient is not opulent. <cb/> II. The ignorant midwife <lb/>
            knows not when to aſſiſt <lb/>or to leave the buſineſs to <lb/>nature; ſo blunders on,
            till <lb/>ſometimes both mother and <lb/>infant are loſt, where there <lb/>was in
            reality no danger.<lb/> III. The accoucheuſe can ſit <lb/>more patiently among fe-
            <lb/>males in a lying-in room, <lb/>where ſhe is looked up to <lb/>every moment for
            aſſiſtance; <lb/>ſhe can better ſooth impa- <lb/>tience, by recalling hope; <lb/>ſhe can
            more properly con- <lb/>tinue in the room conſtantly, <lb/>and delicately give direc-
            <lb/>tions about what is neces- <lb/>ſary, ſo is not ſo eaſily tired out with
            attendance. <pb xml:id="page_23" n="22"/> IV. The accompliſhed ac- <lb/>coucheur hath a
            more ge- <lb/>neral and liberal knowledge of things, by his ſtudy in phyſiology. All the
            parts of animal bodies are known to him, and he can reaſon better on cauſe and effect,
            than women who have amuſed themſelves with faſhions, dreſs, taſte, or ap- <lb/>pearance;
            but ſuch men I have obſerved are ſoon fa- <lb/>tigued with the converſa- <lb/>tions of
            us poor women. <lb/> V. Men in high practice <lb/> ſeldom know how to handle <lb/> new
            born children; they <lb/> often touch them with dis- <lb/>like, as they would toads or
            <lb/> young ſnakes. What is<lb/> then to be done when the <lb/> nurſe is awkward, or at
            a <lb/> loſs how to manage the <lb/> infant, which is too fre- <lb/>quently the caſe?
            <cb/> IV.The ſenſible and ſaga- <lb/>cious midwife may make herſelf more agreeable,
            though ſhe is leſs learned; and as to her neceſſary knowledge in anatomy, ſhe may learn
            it and all the technical terms in a few months; learning is not difficult to thoſe who
            love ſtudy, but knowledge is only uſeful when we poſſeſs ſagacity or ſenſe to apply it
            properly. We have all ſeen learned fools. <lb/> V. Women have commonly <lb/> a great
            ſuperiority over men <lb/> in the care of infants, it is <lb/> more in their province,
            and <lb/> a ſenſible midwife thinks <lb/> ſhe ſhould qualify herſelf <lb/> for every
            adverſe accident <lb/> that may happen. In this <lb/> reſpect women are prefera-
            <lb/>ble to men. </p>

            <lb/>Some Reaſons offered why Women are preferable to Men as Midwives. </head>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>There are many women who cannot converſe eaſily or freely with a man, on many
            circumſtances that happen about the time of parturition, or even on ſome ſexual
            diſorders, this may be called falſe mo- <lb/>deſty, but ſtill it exiſts and cauſes many
            evils; here we ſuppoſe skilful women might be more agree- <lb/>able and uſeful. One of
            the firſt phyſicians in the city, who I believe to be my friend, ſaid to me one day,
            lately, that if clever women would dili- <lb/>gently ſtudy to accompliſh themſelves in
            midwifery, he would wiſh for the ſake of propriety, and the good of mankind, that this
            profeſſion was again reſtored to female hands. It is the opinion of many learned
            phyſicians, that the advantages to the ſex are ſmall, if any, by the over grown number
            of male practitioners, at the ſame time, they are clearly of opinion, that a number of
            eminent accoucheurs ſhould be ſelected and appointed to give advice both to ordinary men
            and women midwives in difficult and preternatural caſes. It is fortunate for us, few,
            very few parturient females, not one in <pb xml:id="page_25" n="24"/>
            <lb/>many hundreds, need be under the neceſſity of calling in an accoucheur. Indeed, the
            numbers of women who are delivered with little aſſiſtance, may convince us how much
            nature acteth in theſe caſes for our advantage. In the obſtetric art, as well as in
            other branches of the ſcience of healing, it might be better if we could wait patiently,
            and would humbly rate ourſelves as the handmaids of nature. Premature practitioners, are
            apt, like the philoſo- <lb/>pher in Raſſelas, to ſuppoſe they can govern the na-
            <lb/>tural courſe of things, but after a few trials, they muſt find out their
            incapacity; a little modeſty and common ſenſe, may point out their errors, but con-
            <lb/>ceited young men and ignorant women are ſeldom eaſily reclaimed from forwardneſs,
            therefore, pru- <lb/>dence ought to induce us to have recourſe when we can, to
            intelligent practitioners. </p>

          <lb/>INFANTS often ſuffer much from the careleſſneſs, ignorance, or officiouſneſs of
          nurſes; to prevent this, it is the duty of an intelligent midwife to caſt a careful eye
          over their conduct, a little conſcientious pains ought to be beſtowed upon it; cleanlineſs
          is a moſt important article, the infant ought to be waſhed twice a day in lukewarm water;
          it is the conſtant cuſtom in the South of Europe, even in ſummer, for if perſpiration or
          any other excrementi- <lb/>tious matter is left on their tender skins, it will ſoon become
          acrid, cauſe inflammation, excoriation, and conſequently much uneaſineſs; this is not
          writ- <lb/>ten from a fine ſpun theory, but is the reſult of ex- <lb/>perience. We are of
          opinion, that waſhing of ten- <lb/>der infants in lukewarm water, is greatly preferable to
          cold water, and that the theory of relaxation is here more imaginary than real, and that
          experience confirms this doctrine. If from neglect, the skin of infants becomes inflamed
          or excoriated, let the <pb xml:id="page_27" n="26"/>
          <lb/>parts be well waſhed, and made dry, then duſt on a little powdered white lead from a
          muſlin cloth, this is ſimple but effectual, but let the ceruſſa, or powder of lead, be
          removed ſo as not to go near their victuals. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>An intelligent midwife that hath as much, perhaps more experience, and I believe hath
          had better opportunities of inſtruction, than any other in this city, from the repetition
          of lectures, hath emphatically deſired me to mention, in my pamphlet, that if infants are
          kept dry and clean, their tempers and diſpoſitions will be more plea- <lb/>ſant; they will
          ſeldom be liable to rickets, or any of thoſe diſorders that affect the bones, ſo as to
          cauſe bandy legs, &amp;c. and that when female in- <lb/>fants are neglected in theſe
          articles, the bones of the pelvis, or loweſt part of the body, are often ſoftened and
          diminiſhed in their natural capacity, ſo as when adults, the diſtorted pelvis cannot admit
          a child to paſs eaſily, and from thence proceedeth the reaſon for inventing of ſo many
          iron inſtruments to faciliate difficult labours, and to give occaſion to bold operators to
          try their hands; moreover, this gentlewoman adds, that if it were not for the <pb
            xml:id="page_28" n="27"/>
          <lb/>neglect of cleanlineſs in infancy, many men and women would be ſtronger in their
          loins, better pro- <lb/>portioned in their limbs, more healthy, and move more gracefully,
          but above all, there would be rarely any cauſe to call in even the prudent and experienced
          accoucher to aſſiſt in parturition; let me add, that theſe obſervations are confirmed by
          the opinions of practical men, whoſe judgments are not apocryphal. An attention to this
          doctrine can never do harm, and nurſes, who conſcientiouſly diſcharge their duty, deſerve
          rewards and friendſhip. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>It ſometimes happens, that wet nurſes have not enough of milk for their nurſelings,
          and make up their food with bread, tapioca, or Indian arrow root, and the common milk of
          this town; we be- <lb/>lieve, that in general, beef tea, mutton or veal broth, mixed with
          them, is preferable. Infants are liable to acidity in the ſtomach and guts, which often

          <lb/>violets, repeated occaſionally, is a ſafe and uſeful laxative. If vomiting from foul
          matter in the ſto- <lb/>mach is troubleſome, one or two grains of the pow- <lb/>der of
          ipecacuan may be given as an emetic, with ſafety, and ſometimes, two or three tea
          ſpoonsful of wine, and ſome warm water, by way of aſſiſting the evacuation, will anſwer
          the purpoſe; if more is wanted, the beſt way is to apply ſoon for proper advice. </p>

          <lb/>In childrens diſeaſes, much may be done by li- <lb/>beral well informed women; in

          either the learned phyſician, or the skilful apothecary, whoſe longeſt viſits laſt only a

          diſorders, as I do of the French Directory, or the Iriſh Rebellion. Would it not be
          better, to find out ſome intelligent perſon, who can and will give attention to them? It
          is true, ſome do recover in ſpite of bad treatment, but, if they die, are not the parents
          blameable for over- <lb/>looking ſo important a concern? If ſome women can be found fit
          for all the important duties of a midwife, and of giving ſound advice in ſexual diſorders,
          or in thoſe of children, why heſitate to employ them? Are women by nature incapable of
          inſtruction, or are they deficient in ſagacity to be uſeful? Cuſtom or faſhion govern the
          world, and often deprives us of that judgment, or common ſenſe, that would be more
          advantageous to ſociety. Let it not be ſuppoſed, I wiſh to reject the advice of able men,
          far from it, I wiſh only to demonſtrate that women may be capable of being very uſeful in
          ſexual diſorders, as well as in thoſe of children; it ſeems to me as if nature had
          allotted this part of the healing art to females, becauſe we have better opportunities of
          inveſtigating the real ſtate of the illneſs, and if benevolently aſſiſted by ſagacious
          phyſicians, might ſave many lives. </p>

          women who employ men- <lb/>midwives, are in general, an eaſier prey than thoſe who do not.
          It is ſtep by ſtep, or ſlow advances, that women commonly arrive at vice, juſt ſo, do

            <lb/>Females, when young, may at leaſt claim equal eſteem with their brothers, the lords
            of creation, for filial affection, and all the virtues of parental obedience; as wives,
            men of great obſervation have given teſtimony in their writings, that we are by no means
            inferior to our husbands in conjugal duties. </p>
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>As mothers, I have ſtill the teſtimony of men, that we are full as tender and
            careful of our chil- <lb/>dren as their fathers are; as miſtreſſes of fami- <lb/>lies,
            are we not equally economical, as kind to our ſervants, and benevolent to the poor?
            Authors of the moſt eminent abilities, after a comparative review of both ſexes, have
            candidly declared, upon the whole, we are by no means inferior, or rather we are
            ſuperior, in acting our parts in all the con- <lb/>cerns of life. All theſe
            commendations we can re- <lb/>ceive with conſcious pride, while we merit them, but when
            we part with delicacy or modeſty, alas! how are we fallen! even, like a flower after it
            is cropt, ſoon loſeth all its ſweetneſs, and is caſt like a loathſome weed away. I wiſh
            my amiable readers <pb xml:id="page_33" n="32"/>
            <lb/>may conſider here what I have ſaid, both in a moral, and a religious point of view;
            it can do them no harm, and if the thinking part of men can alſo agree with me, it may
            be an object worthy of their atten- <lb/>tion, to leſſen, or do away one of the greateſt

            <lb/>I could wiſh that female education was more ſo- <lb/>licitouſly attended to. When

            bad examples, of eaſe, free- <lb/>dom, faſhion, grace, &amp;c. inſenſibly we loſe the
            elegant ſweetneſs of female delicacy and reſerve. I am always happy to ſee young ladies

            well-toned inſtruments, or tranſported by the melting ſounds of the voice, and to behold
            their taſte in drawing; but I am ſometimes ſorry to find, that theſe accompliſhed young
            ladies are ignorant of the grammar of their own language, that they are deficient in
            underſtanding the firſt principles of virtue, and that they have had no inſtruction on
            the holy ſcriptures; the firſt of theſe two laſt, may ſhew them the beauty and felicity

            pleaſing; it would make religion more rational, by opening their eyés to the power and
            goodneſs of the Almighty in all his works. </p>
