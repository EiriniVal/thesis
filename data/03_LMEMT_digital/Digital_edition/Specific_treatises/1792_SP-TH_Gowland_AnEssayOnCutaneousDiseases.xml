        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>NNUMERABLE are the agents which diſturb <lb/>our health, and
          make us liable to a wonderful <lb/>variety of diſorders and diſeaſes; and it has ever
          <lb/>been the buſineſs of the good Phyſician to exert <lb/>his application, ſtudy, and
          diligence, in propor- <lb/>tion to their danger and malignancy—Phyſicians, <lb/>I ſay,
          whoſe lives are occupied in deſtroying the <lb/>exiſting cauſes of the different maladies
          to which <lb/>we are ſubject, and of re-eſtabliſhing the good <lb/>order of the animal
          economy, are certainly the <lb/>moſt noble portion of ſociety, the moſt uſeful, <lb/>and
          (as Cicero has expreſſed himſelf) "Who <lb/>neareſt approach the Divinity." </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Cutaneous Eruptions, although an affection ſo <lb/>very general, an affection, common
          to all ages, <lb/>all conſtitutions, all cities and countries, have, <lb/>from the
          enlightened, received little more than <lb/>mere theoretical diſcuſſion; and thus,
          unhappily <lb/>they are not even yet, advanced a long way in <lb/>this branch of their
          art. </p>
        <pb xml:id="page_3" n="4"/>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The only reaſon of their not having made <lb/>progreſs in this part of the ſcience,
          ariſes from <lb/>an error, which, till lately, was univerſally adopt- <lb/>ed concerning
          the ORIGIN of theſe diſeaſes. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Every one ſeemed ſure that a vice did exiſt in <lb/>the blood, which when carried to
          the ſurface of <lb/>the body, produced the different morbific appear- <lb/>ances: and
          each, as vainly endeavoured to deter- <lb/>mine the CHARACTER and QUALITIES of <lb/>this
          imaginary vice; their labours were neceſſa- <lb/>rily abortive, and, as will ever be the
          caſe <lb/>where the criterion cannot be found, a variety <lb/>of opinions neceſſarily
          aroſe. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>From theſe erroneous and falſe principles they <lb/>deduced their medical
          indications, or, in other <lb/>terms, their method of cure; and theſe methods <lb/>were
          not <hi rend="italic">unique,</hi> but as numerous and as diffe- <lb/>rent, as had been
          their particular opinions: con- <lb/>ſequently, by purſuing the FALSE, the true means
          <lb/>were neglected. This accounts for their back- <lb/>wardness and univerſal want of
          ſucceſs in theſe <lb/>complaints. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The caſe is now different; I ſay different, be- <lb/>cauſe in thoſe latter times
          Phyſicians have known, <lb/>that the diſeaſes of the ſkin, are a local affection,
          <lb/>produced by a depraved and altered ſecretion <lb/>of the extreme arterial veſſels,
          or, the cutaneous <lb/>glands, which are in a <hi rend="sc">preternatural state</hi>:
          <lb/>conſequently, this knowledge has led them to <pb xml:id="page_4" n="5"/>
          <lb/>attempt the cure, with topical, or external medi- <lb/>cines. The effects have often
          correſponded with <lb/>their expectation; but often alſo, their expecta- <lb/>tions have
          been fruſtrated, for want of a SPE- <lb/>CIFIC REMEDY. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Experience only could bring forward this ſpe- <lb/>cific, which Phyſicians, by ſimple
          reaſoning alone, <lb/>never could diſcover. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>As all new doctrines in medicine amount to an <lb/>impeachment of, and directly
          militate againſt, the <lb/>judgment and practice of the day in which they <lb/>are
          propoſed; they have therefore, not only men's <lb/>prejudices to encounter, but alſo their
          pride; <lb/>and frequently, nothing but the determination of <lb/>the patients themſelvs
          can make their adoption <lb/>general: this was particularly inſtanced in the in-
          <lb/>troduction of the Bark, Inoculation, &amp;c. &amp;c. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The ſituation of Mr. Gowland, as Apothecary <lb/>to the Three Royal Houſeholds, was
          particularly <lb/>favourable, and gave more frequent occaſion to <lb/>his experience in
          the complaints of which we are <lb/>about to ſpeak, than moſt others; and he lau-
          <lb/>dably availed himſelf at an early ſtage of this <lb/>doctrine, with that alertneſs,
          and obſervation, <lb/>which eventually produced the ſpecific in queſ- <lb/>tion. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>He had obſerved the treatment employed on <lb/>Miſs Chudleigh, by the Phyſicians
          under whoſe <lb/>care ſhe was, and the inefficacy, with which it was <pb xml:id="page_5"
            n="6"/>
          <lb/>attended; and <hi rend="italic">although</hi> his Lotion was not admi- <lb/>niſtered,
          until their efforts had failed of ſucceſs, <lb/>its wonderful effects went beyond his own,
          <lb/>or even his patient's hopes <note place="bottom" n="*" rend="size(0.5)">* For a more
            particular account ſee the Proprietor's Eleemoſynary <lb/>Pamphlet. </note>. This fact
          alone, <lb/>was not ſufficient to canonize the Lotion and en- <lb/>ſure to it the
          reputation of SPECIFIC: but a <lb/>long uſe, a ſcrutinizing and judicious obſerva-
          <lb/>tion, was further neceſſary. The fact, how- <lb/>ever, being known, a great number of
          afflicted <lb/>perſons, the more readily concurred to try the <lb/>remedy. This afforded
          him the opportunity of <lb/>verifying and eſtabliſhing, the vaſt power of his <lb/>Lotion,
          and at the ſame time, was the moſt <lb/>complete defence of his doctrine and his repu-
          <lb/>tation, againſt the invidious attacks of thoſe in- <lb/>tereſted men of his time,
          whoſe practice it ſo di- <lb/>rectly militated againſt. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>This happy diſcovery of Mr. Gowland's has <lb/>been much more intereſting, and more
          uſeful to <lb/>mankind, than all the volumes written to this day <lb/>upon Eruptions of
          the Skin, as they contain no- <lb/>thing but Theories, and have always been defec-
          <lb/>tive in the moſt eſſential part, namely, <hi rend="sc">the man- <lb/>ner of
            curing</hi>, &amp;c. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>It is not enough to <hi rend="sc">speak</hi> well upon diſeaſes; <lb/>the thing more
          important is to <hi rend="sc">relieve</hi> them. </p>
        <pb xml:id="page_6" n="7"/>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>This recalls to my recollection, the hiſtory of <lb/>thoſe two Greek ſculptors, who
          were called by the <lb/>Senate, in order to learn from them, how they <lb/>would execute a
          ſtatue which might be alluſive <lb/>to an hero of Greece, and erect it to his glory.
          <lb/>One of them made a long diſcourſe, which ſhowed <lb/>him to have an exquiſite taſte,
          and proved, that he <lb/>was completely maſter, at leaſt of the theory of his <lb/>art: as
          he finiſhed, the opinion of the other was <lb/>required; he anſwered in a few words, "I
          will <hi rend="sc">do</hi>
          <lb/>what my colleague has <hi rend="sc">said</hi>;" and he was choſen <lb/>by the Senate,
          becauſe they deſired <hi rend="sc">the work</hi>, <lb/>and not a diſſertation upon the
          work. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>I have no doubt that many Phyſicians have <lb/>ſpoken with more elegance and
          eloquence, upon <lb/>the impurities of the ſkin than Mr. Gowland has <lb/>done—but Mr.
          Gowland <hi rend="sc">relieved his pa- <lb/>tients</hi>. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Nor is this the only advantage enjoyed by <lb/>him; it will appear, by this eſſay,
          that he was ac- <lb/>quainted with the true cauſes of this diſeaſe. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>The many reaſons and proofs, which both de- <lb/>monſtrate his knowledge, and the
          truth of the <lb/>doctrine, have received additional weight, from <lb/>having ſince
          appeared, in the works of the moſt <lb/>enlightened Phyſicians of the preſent day, and
          <lb/>which prove incontrovertibly, that the cutaneous <lb/>affections are mere <hi
            rend="sc">local</hi> affections. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>It is to be lamented that medical works are <pb xml:id="page_7" n="8"/>
          <lb/>chiefly confined to the readings of medical men; <lb/>and of courſe, however
          indiſpenſable and whole- <lb/>ſome, the doctrine may be, are therefore never
          <lb/>thoroughly diſſeminated, eſpecially, when re- <lb/>pugnant to the general conſumption
          of medi- <lb/>cine. How far that has been the caſe in what <lb/>has formerly been written
          on this ſubject, is left <lb/>to the diſcernment of the reader. This remark, <lb/>however,
          may be made, that, the uſe of a Topical <lb/>Remedy, in cutaneous diſeaſes, muſt entirely
          ſu- <lb/>perſede the uſe of internal medicine for theſe <lb/>complaints; from its
          pleaſantneſs, eaſe, and cer- <lb/>tainty of cure. Hence ſome oppoſition may be
          <lb/>expected from the ſelfiſh as well as the ignorant: <lb/>characters unhappily too
          common, even in this <lb/>profeſſion—characters, on whom the remark of <lb/>CICERO ſhould
          be reverſed <note place="bottom" n="*" rend="size(0.5)">* There exiſts in this country a
            very vulgar, but at the ſame time a <lb/>very univerſal error, reſpecting the term <hi
              rend="italic">Humour;</hi> it is never uſed, or <lb/>thought of, but we have an idea
            of virus or acrimony: whereas the term <lb/>literally means a fluid, and this fluid is
            as likely to be good as bad; the <lb/>blood itſelf is a humour; there is alſo a fluid or
            humour of the pericar- <lb/>dium, and of all cavities, fit and neceſſary for preſerving
            the viſcera, &amp;c. <lb/>from friction, and many others: theſe are not morbid or
            vicious, but ab- <lb/>ſolutely <hi rend="sc">good</hi>. <p rend="indent">
              <lb/>The only place in which the term is generally properly underſtood is <lb/>when we
              ſpeak of the humidity of the weather, meaning a dampneſs in <lb/>the air: here the

              <lb/>of ſome, and the wickedneſs of others, in diſtorting this ſenſeleſs term
              <lb/>merely to frighten or alarm us thereby into a courſe of uſeleſs internal
              <lb/>medicine, and inſtead of forwarding, to deter us from the only means of

          one affection, the <hi rend="italic">moſt</hi> common, <lb/>and, at the ſame time the <hi
            rend="italic">leaſt</hi> dangerous: it is <lb/>not preceded by any cauſes, capable of
          inducing <lb/>a diſorder in the animal economy, and thoſe who <lb/>are thus afflicted
          always enjoy the beſt ſtate of <lb/>health. This excludes the idea of that humoral
          <lb/>vice, to which ſome Phyſicians, aſcribe every <lb/>diſorder, when the cauſe thereof
          is unknown to <lb/>them. Some learned Engliſh Phyſicians, how- <lb/>ever, of the preſent
          day, have taken away the <lb/>veil to this ſpecies of impoſture, and have brought <lb/>to
          light the vacuum that did exiſt in the hy- <lb/>potheſis of humours; and yet,
          notwithſtanding <lb/>their efforts, the ſame prejudices nevertheleſs <lb/>exiſt, and
          indeed, are almoſt general, from their <lb/>works having been chiefly confined to the
          read- <lb/>ing of medical men. The humouriſts have ne- <lb/>ver been able to ſupport their
          opinion beyond <lb/>the moſt <hi rend="italic">ſimple conjecture,</hi> the ſtrongeſt of
          which <lb/>is, that the work of Chylification and Sanguifica- <lb/>tion, or of Chyle and
          Blood, is often ill perform- <pb xml:id="page_13" n="14"/>
          <lb/>ed, and conſequently the fluids remove more or <lb/>leſs from their natural ſtate.
          One might anſwer <lb/>theſe gentlemen, that if the aliments are not all <lb/>converted
          into chyle, the lymphatics or lacteal <lb/>veſſels of the inteſtines do not abſorb the
          remain- <lb/>der, and that they refuſe admiſſion to all matters <lb/>which have either an
            <hi rend="italic">acid</hi> or alkaline quality; <lb/>that is, theſe veſſels have a
          power of attracting <lb/>what is proper for them, and of repelling what <lb/>is not: thus
          their mouths become ſhut the inſtant <lb/>their outer extremities are approached by theſe
          <lb/>ſubſtances, and except to ſome violent medicines, <lb/>open only to what is
          neutraliſed and fit for nu- <lb/>trition. In order to demonſtrate this, we need <lb/>but
          obſerve, that there are always matters in the <lb/>inteſtinal canal, which are naturally
          in a cor- <lb/>rupted ſtate, namely the reſidium of the chylifi- <lb/>cation or
          excrements, and which, are refuſed upon <lb/>the ſame principle. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>There is alſo in the inteſtines a quantity of <lb/>gaz really mixed with the aliments
          and chyle; <lb/>but this is never abſorbed by the lymphatics in <lb/>the pure ſtate of
          gaz; I ſay <hi rend="italic">never,</hi> becauſe if it <lb/>ſhould happen, immediate death
          would be the <lb/>certain conſequence of ſuch abſorption: in fact, <lb/>when this gaz, or
          ethereal fluid are injected into <lb/>the cellular of the ſkin, or into the veſſels of any
          <lb/>animal, the moſt dreadful diſorders enſue, and, in <lb/>general, death itſelf. This
          has been demonſtrated <lb/>by the experiments of the Abbe Vaſſalli. And, <pb
            xml:id="page_14" n="15"/>
          <lb/>as to the ſanguification, it is demonſtrated, that <lb/>the <hi rend="italic"
            >atmoſphere</hi> makes this admirable proceſs,— <lb/>changes and converts the fluids
          into animal ſub- <lb/>ſtances, and renders them proper for nutrition: it <lb/>is for this
          reaſon, that in individuals who have a <lb/>bad temperament or conſtitution, the blood is
          as <lb/>good, as in the moſt robuſt, and healthy. This <lb/>fine and precious obſervation,
          is made by Dr. <lb/>Ballonius, the Hyppocrates of France. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>There are alſo poſitive vital powers, in the <lb/>life of the animal, which prevent
          the <hi rend="italic">degenera- <lb/>tion</hi> of humours, as is demonſtrated by experi-
          <lb/>ments and facts; from which it reſults, that the <lb/>circulating fluids, though they
          are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> refreſhed <lb/>by new aliments, preſerve themſelves
          innocent. <lb/>V. Haller Phyſiolog:—<hi rend="italic">Tit de fame et Siti,</hi> &amp;c.
          <lb/>And laſtly, many organs exiſt in the animal body, <lb/>which continually purge and
          purify the maſs of <lb/>blood, if by any accident heterogeneous matter <lb/>ſhould
          intermix therewith: but without ſtopping <lb/>any longer on this queſtion, I return to my
          ſub- <lb/>ject. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>I have ſaid that the Cutaneous Eruptions do <lb/>not originate by any acrimony of the
          fluids: <lb/>their proximate cauſe is an <hi rend="italic">altered ſecretion,</hi>
          <lb/>which takes place in the ſkin. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>That the perſpiration be a ſecretion, <hi rend="italic">ſui gene- <lb/>ris,</hi> is a
          fact which wants no proof, and it would be <lb/>ridiculous to doubt, and queſtion, upon
          any phy- <pb xml:id="page_15" n="16"/>
          <lb/>ſiological point ſo evident as this is. That <hi rend="italic">every</hi>
          <lb/>ſecretion is liable to be changed, and more or <lb/>leſs altered, by a variety of
          circumſtances, there <lb/>are many inſtances. Individuals who are ſea- <lb/>ſick, often
          bring up a great quantity of bile, <lb/>which is black and corroſive, and is very far
          <lb/>from being in a natural ſtate. It alſo happens <lb/>frequently that children when
          cutting their teeth <lb/>have very fetid Diarrhoea, from the ſtimulus of <lb/>the gums
          communicating with the inteſtines. It <lb/>is an obſervation of Sydenham, that hyſterical
          <lb/>women ſometimes vomit bilious and depraved <lb/>matters, which did not exiſt before
          the paroxiſm <lb/>in the ſtomach nor in the bowels, but which had <lb/>been ſeparated
          during the paroxiſm itſelf. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>In the ſame women, as well as in the hy- <lb/>pochondriacal, when afflicted by their
          mala- <lb/>dies, a very copious quantity of urine is in- <lb/>ſtantaneouſly ſeparated, and
          it is as limpid and <lb/>clear, as ſpring water. This ſecretion is the ſure, <lb/>or as
          Phyſicians ſay, the pathognomonicon ſign <lb/>of this diſorder. Sometimes fear alone will
          ſud- <lb/>denly arreſt the menſtrua; ſometimes anger will <lb/>provoke an hemorrhage of
          the uterus. Grief <lb/>and ſorrow conſtantly occaſion a greater ſecre- <lb/>tion of bile,
          and this fluid is ſometimes ſo acrid <lb/>as to produce convulſions, or the more dreadful
          <lb/>effects of melancholy, or pains in the inteſtines, <lb/>or colick; and if it be by
          any accident abſorbed <pb xml:id="page_16" n="17"/>
          <lb/>and brought into circulation, excites ſome ſe- <lb/>rious or fatal diſorders. The
          ſecretion of the <lb/>milk, by violent <hi rend="italic">pathemata,</hi> or paſſions of
          the <lb/>mind, has been on ſeveral occaſions ſtopped, and <lb/>it often happens that its
          qualities are changed <lb/>and vitiated: in the laſt caſe the child is violently
          <lb/>purged, or affected with convulſion-fits, and other <lb/>indiſpoſitions and
          diſorders. In a word, every <lb/>organ, which nature has deſtined to perform any
          <lb/>ſecretion, is ſubjected to the influence of the <lb/>nerves, and as a certain
          conſequence receives <lb/>and partakes of all the affections of this ſyſtem. </p>
        <p rend="indent">
          <lb/>Now nothing is more certain, than that thoſe <lb/>organs, which are ſupplied with the
          greateſt ſhare <lb/>of ſenſibility, and which have a more intimate <lb/>connection (let me
          ſay) with the nervous ſyſtem, <lb/>will ſuffer more than other parts in exact propor-
          <lb/>tion to the cloſeneſs of that connection. I will <lb/>now ask what part in the animal
          body, has ſo much <lb/>connection with, or dependence on the nerves, <lb/>as the ſkin?
          Certainly none. It is from the in- <lb/>numerable quantity of nerves which are inter-
          <lb/>ſperſed throughout, and actually terminate in the <lb/>ſkin <note place="bottom"

          <lb/>other <hi rend="sc">causes</hi>, are capable of influencing the <lb/>tranſpiration,
          and thereby materially affecting the <lb/>health of the ſkin; beſides, that the action of
          the <lb/>atmoſphere muſt be calculated, and conſidered, <lb/>as one of the moſt obvious,

          <lb/>The cauſes laſt ſpoken of, do not always act; <lb/>for inſtance, they do not act when

          <lb/>Another remark muſt be made on the method <lb/>of humoriſts; it is, that they attempt
