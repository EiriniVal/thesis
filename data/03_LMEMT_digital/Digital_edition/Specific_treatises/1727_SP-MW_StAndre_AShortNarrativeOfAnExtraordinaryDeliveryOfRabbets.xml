                    <lb/>that upon her firſt Pains, the Bones <lb/>of the Animal were ſenſibly heard

                <p rend="indent"><lb/>On <hi rend="italic">Wedneſday</hi> the 23d Inſtant, I

                    <lb/>as uſual. I viſited her ſeveral times <lb/>that Day, and proceeded in every

                    brown Paper was tearing <lb/>from within her. Towards eight a Clock <lb/>that
