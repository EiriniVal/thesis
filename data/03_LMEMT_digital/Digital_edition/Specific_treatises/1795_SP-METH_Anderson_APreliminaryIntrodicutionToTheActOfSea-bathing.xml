          <lb/>The ſubject matter, thus aſſigned me to ſift and <lb/>handle, is ſufficiently

          at the preſent day, <lb/>than a knowledge of it is yet poſſeſſed. There <lb/>is in it
          great room to advance, explain, en- <lb/>force, and reſtrain. What I deliver ſhall,
          <lb/>though connected, be in diſtinct tracts, in or- <lb/>der to relieve the reader, and
          make them come <lb/>eaſy to the purchaſer: the whole will be the re- <lb/>ſult of long

          diſcovery of <lb/>the ſeveral dependencies, cauſes, and connexion of <lb/>things, ſo far
          as comes within the ken of human <lb/>intelligence. All theory beyond this, is as vain

          illuſtration and juſt repre- <lb/>ſentation, by example, is required to enlighten <lb/>and

          admitting of no <lb/>objections againſt the concluſions, but ſuch as are <lb/>taken from
          experiments and obſervations, or other <lb/>certain truths: and although the arguing from
          <lb/>experiments and obſervations by induction, be no <lb/>demonſtration of general
          concluſions, yet it is the <lb/>beſt way of reaſoning, which the nature of things
          <lb/>admit of, and may be looked upon as ſo much the <lb/>ſtronger, by how much the
          induction is more <lb/>general: and if no exception occur from phe- <lb/>nomena, the
          concluſion may be pronounced ge- <lb/>nerally. But if at any time afterwards, any
          <lb/>exceptions do occur from experiments, it may <lb/>be pronounced, with ſuch exceptions
          as ſhall occur. <lb/>By this way of analyſis, we may proceed from <lb/>compounds to
          ingredients, and from motions to <lb/>the forces producing them; and in general from
          <lb/>effects to their cauſes, and from particular cauſes <lb/>to more general ones, till
