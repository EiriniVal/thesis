        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi> Think the public much obliged to <lb/>your correſpondent who
        ſigns Z. <lb/><hi rend="italic">(ſee p. 261,)</hi> for communicating the <lb/>advantage he
        obtained againſt a ſtone <lb/>in the kidneys by his uſe of the juice <lb/>of lemmons with
        water, as his common <lb/>drink. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In ſupport of his recommendation, <lb/>I ſhall mention my own experience; <lb/>but
        previouſly give ſome account of <lb/>the trials I made with the juice of lem- <lb/>mons upon
        ſeveral fragments of ſtones <lb/>taken out of human bodies. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the year 1738 I made many ex- <lb/>periments in order to diſcover whether <lb/>any
        of our aliments have a quality diſ- <lb/>ſolvent of the ſtone, and found that <lb/>many had
        ſuch a quality, and that in <lb/>the juice of lemmons it is very ſtrong. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This juice diſſolves pieces of mar- <lb/>ble, alabaſter, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
        in a ſurpriſing <lb/>manner, and any perſon may eaſily <lb/>try the experiment: Let a piece
        of <lb/>marble or alabaſter be put into a wine <lb/>glaſs, and covered with the juice of
        <lb/>lemmons an inch or more, and they <lb/>will ſee air-bubbles aſcend in great a-
        <lb/>bundance, and continue aſcending <lb/>many hours, and the particles of ſtone <lb/>keep
        dividing into the apperance of <lb/>a fine white powder. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The effect of theſe experiments fill- <lb/>ed me with great joy; now, thought <lb/>I,
        this juice will be an effectual reme- <lb/>dy for the ſtone. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>A little time after I began theſe re- <lb/>ſearches, I obtained many ſmall <hi
          rend="italic">calcu- <lb/>li</hi>, and fragments of greater, chiefly <lb/>from Sir <hi
          rend="italic">Hans Sloan</hi>, and went to work <lb/>with them, as in the forementioned
        ex- <lb/>periments, but was ſadly diſappoint- <lb/>ed, for I ſaw no air-bubbles ariſe from
        <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">calculi</hi>: I let them ſtand many <lb/>days in the juice of
        lemmons, and dai- <lb/>ly viewed them, and could diſcern no <lb/>alteration in the
        appearance either of <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">calculi</hi> or juice, but when I poured
        <lb/>off the juice, and took the calculi with <lb/>my fingers, they felt like a ſoft jelly;
        <lb/>which proves that the union of their <lb/>conſtituent parts was diſſolved, and
        <lb/>likewiſe proves, that air is not one of <lb/>the conſtituent parts of the ſtones for-
        <lb/>med in human bodies, as it is of mar- <lb/>ble, alabaſter, <hi rend="italic"
          >&amp;c.</hi> whoſe interſtices <lb/>contain ſurprizing quantities of it. <lb/>This
        diſcovery of a quality in the juice <lb/>of lemmons diſſolvent of the ſtone re- <lb/>vived
        my joy. </p>
      <pb n="355"/>
      <cb n="1"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the courſe of my experiments I <lb/>found that good diſſolvents will not
        <lb/>diſſolve every ſort of <hi rend="italic">calculi</hi>, therefore <lb/>thoſe perſons who
        are troubled with <lb/>the ſtone, ſhould make uſe of the dif- <lb/>ferent ſorts of
        diſſolvents in their di- <lb/>et, and manner of living. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In my treatiſe on diſſolvents of the <lb/>ſtone, I have ſhewed which of our ali-
        <lb/>ments have that happy quality; and <lb/>have given proper directions for the <lb/>diet
        of perſons afflicted with the ſtone. <lb/>I ſhall now give an account of my own
        <lb/>nephritic diſorders, and of what I have <lb/>done for my relief. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Many years ago, while I lived at <lb/><hi rend="italic">Yeovill</hi> in <hi
          rend="italic">Somerſetſhire</hi>, where the wa- <lb/>ter is petrifying, I had terrible
        fits of <lb/>the ſtone from very ſmall <hi rend="italic">calculi</hi>, form- <lb/>ed chiefly
        in my left kidney, ſeldom <lb/>bigger than a grain of wheat, or bar- <lb/>ley; but after the
        little ſtone was mo- <lb/>ved out of its place, while it was paſ- <lb/>ſing down the ureter,
        till it fell into <lb/>the bladder, I ſuffered the moſt exqui- <lb/>ſite pains, which no pen
        can deſcribe, <lb/>nor any perſon form an adequate idea <lb/>of, who has not felt them; but
        as ſoon <lb/>as the <hi rend="italic">calculus</hi> was in my bladder, there <lb/>was an end
        of my miſery. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>While the little ſtone was paſſing in- <lb/>to the bladder, which took up near 30
        <lb/>hours, ſometimes more, the extreme <lb/>pains made me ſweat profuſely, even <lb/>in
        froſty weather, and ſometimes <lb/>brought on a ſymptomatic fever. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>My fits of the ſtone were common- <lb/>ly preceded by an evacuation of blood, <lb/>or a
        bloody, or a coffee-coloured urine; <lb/>and when either of theſe ſymptoms <lb/>happened, I
        concluded that the terri- <lb/>ble pains were approaching. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It ſeemed difficult at firſt to account <lb/>for the diſcharge of ſuch urins ante-
        <lb/>cedent to the pains; but on conſider- <lb/>ing that point, it appeared to me that
        <lb/>no nerves terminate in the membranes <lb/>which compoſe the coats of the veins,
        <lb/>and that this is the reaſon why hæ- <lb/>morrhages, or bleedings from the <lb/>noſtrils
        and other parts of the body <lb/>come without pain. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I likewiſe apprehend that none of <lb/>the nerves by which we feel do enter <lb/>the
        ſtructure of the coats of the arte- <lb/>ries, and this ſeems to be one of the
        <lb/>wonderful contrivances of the divine <lb/>wiſdom in the formation of human <lb/>bodies:
        For if the feeling nerves ter- <lb/>minated in the inner ſuperficies of the <lb/>arteries
        (as they do in the <hi rend="italic">cutis</hi> and the <lb/>inner ſuperficies of the
        ſtomach and <lb/>bowels <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> the acrid particles (which, <lb/>when
        excreted to the extremities of the <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>nerves, either in the outer or inner <lb/>ſuperficies of the body excite pain)
        <lb/>would unavoidably excite pain all along <lb/>the arteries, as they paſs through them
        <lb/>in their courſe of circulation, and raiſe <lb/>painful contractions, which would put
        <lb/>a ſtop to the circulation of the blood, <lb/>and an end to life. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>How I managed myſelf under fits of <lb/>the ſtone, is related in my treatiſe on
        <lb/>painful diſtempers, p. 196, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> But <lb/>reading an account
        of coffee in Mr <hi rend="italic">Ray</hi>'s <lb/><hi rend="italic">Hiſtoria Plantarum</hi>,
        I obſerved in his <lb/>quotation from <hi rend="italic">Muis</hi>, his mentioning <lb/>that
          <hi rend="italic">Muis</hi> knew ſome who became free <lb/>from their nephritic pains by
        drinking <lb/>coffee <note n="*" place="bottom" rend="size(0.8)">
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>* Idem nonnullos inquit novi meorum fa- <lb/>miliaram antea haud parum á nephritide

      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Hereupon, I reſolved to try this re- <lb/>medy; and drank half a pint of ſtrong
        <lb/>coffee every day. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I had a fit of the ſtone in about a <lb/>fortnight after I began the courſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In a few months I removed from that <lb/>town and its petrifying waters, to <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">Witham</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Eſſex</hi>, in 1722; but conti- <lb/>nued
        my coffee-drinking. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I had a fit of the ſtone as I remem- <lb/>ber in 1729, and another in 1738, but
        <lb/>neither of theſe was ſo violent as thoſe <lb/>I had at <hi rend="italic">Yeovill</hi>;
        and I do not know <lb/>that any <hi rend="italic">calculus</hi> has ſince paſſed from
        <lb/>either of my kidnies. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Remaining free from my nephritic <lb/>pains, I left off the uſe of coffee for <lb/>ſome
        years. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>But about threee or four years ago I <lb/>had ſome ſymptoms which made me
        <lb/>apprehenſive that I had the ſtone, not <lb/>in either of my kidneys, but in my
        <lb/>bladder; for my occaſions to make <lb/>water were much more frequent than <lb/>uſual,
        and the contraction of the blad- <lb/>der, by endeavouring to diſcharge the <lb/>urine,
        occaſioned a painful preſſure <lb/>of a ſtone againſt the ſphincter of my <lb/>bladder. And
        when I was in my cha- <lb/>riot, every jolt gave me much pain in <lb/>the neck of my
        bladder, and I made <lb/>bloody water for ſeveral hours after I <lb/>returned home. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I could bear driving a-trott in the <lb/>country when the roads were not ſto- <lb/>ney,
        but could not bear going a foot- <lb/>pace in our ſtreets without much pain; <lb/>though I
        had good ſprings behind it. <lb/>Therefore, for breaking the force of <lb/>the ſide and
        croſs jolts, I directed my <pb n="356"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>coach-maker to put two pair of collar <lb/>braces round the perch of my chariot,
        <lb/>one pair under the fore-part, and the <lb/>other under the hinder part of the bo-
        <lb/>dy of it, and two ſteel ſprings on each <lb/>ſide of the perch for the braces to go
        <lb/>over; and a fifth ſpring I directed to <lb/>be fixed on the upper part of the
        <lb/>perch to bear againſt the fore-part of <lb/>the body of the chariot, for abating
        <lb/>the force of the forward jolts. Theſe <lb/>ſprings not in view, have well anſwer-
        <lb/>ed my deſign, and made my carriage <lb/>one of the eaſieſt that is in uſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I made bloody water frequently for <lb/>many months after going abroad, and <lb/>had
        very frequent urgings to make <lb/>water. Every jolt, and every endea- <lb/>vour to
        diſcharge my water, excited <lb/>much pain in the neck of my blad- <lb/>der; and often when
        pain was excited <lb/>there, I immediately felt a painful ſen- <lb/>ſation in the
        extremities of the nerves, <lb/>terminating near the great toes of each <lb/>foot. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>But when the painful preſſures ceaſ- <lb/>ed, my pains ceaſed, and I render <lb/>thanks
        and praiſe to my merciful God <lb/>for the ſhortneſs of my pains, and for <lb/>preſerving me
        from a total ſuppreſſion <lb/>of urine. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>My diſorder has neither confined me <lb/>an hour at home, nor kept me any <lb/>night
        from quiet ſleep. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When I perceived the ſymptoms of <lb/>a ſtone in my bladder, I returned to <lb/>the uſe
        of coffee. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>And on the account of my bloody <lb/>water, I ordered my ſervant firſt to <lb/>make a
        tea with ground ivy, and then <lb/>to make my coffee with that tea, which <lb/>rendered the
        flavour to me more agree- <lb/>able: I put about one ſpoonful of milk <lb/>to a quarter of a
        pint diſh of coffee, <lb/>and made it very ſweet to my palate; <lb/>I drink three diſhes at
        breakfaſt, and <lb/>two in the afternoon. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This liquor, we call coffee, as I have <lb/>obſerved, does not ſtimulate as a diu-
        <lb/>retic, nor occaſion a pale-coloured u- <lb/>rine like water, but all the proper con-
        <lb/>tents of urine come off with it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Indeed, after drinking plentifully of <lb/>tea, punch, cyder, <hi rend="italic"
          >&amp;c.</hi> the urine of- <lb/>ten comes off colourleſs; and when it <lb/>ſo happens,
        the ſaline, the oleaginous, <lb/>and other excrementitious parts of the <lb/>blood are
        retained in it, till, by ſome <lb/>other liquor or exerciſe, the urine is <lb/>brought again
        to its proper colour. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>When ſuch a pale urine happens, <lb/>the liquor before drank was improper <lb/>for the
        perſon, or was taken in too <lb/>large a quantity<unclear>-</unclear> This is commonly <cb
          n="2"/>
        <lb/>the caſe when diſorders in the paſſions <lb/>of the mind did not precede. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It is a good rule for every man's ob- <lb/>ſervance, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> to
        avoid ſuch liquors as <lb/>occaſion a colourleſs urine, or to drink <lb/>them in leſs
        quantity. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>My drink at dinner is about half a <lb/>pint of new river water, with the <lb/>juice of
