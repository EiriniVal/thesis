        preſently <lb/>aſſwaged or totally removed by this re- <lb/>medy. A gentleman of
        diſtinction, <lb/>who had been almoſt deaf a conſider- <lb/>able time with a ſinging in the
        ears, was <lb/>cured in three or four minutes. A man <lb/>57 years old, deaf for 32 years
        paſt, <lb/>from a wound under the left eye, and <lb/>much afflicted with a violent
        tooth-act, <lb/>was cured of this laſt complaint im- <lb/>mediately, and ſoon afterwards his
        hear- <lb/>ing in a great meaſure. A young man <lb/>of 22, who had almoſt loſt his hearing
        <lb/>for ſix months, by violent vomitings, <lb/>which forced blood out at his ears, <lb/>was
        cured in as little time as the for- <lb/>mer, and continues to hear perfectly <lb/>well. A
        girl of ſeven, born deaf, who <lb/>conſequently could not ſpeak, began to <lb/>hear words
        ſpoken very loud in her <lb/>ear, and could repeat ſome of them in <lb/>a few days. In the
        year 1744 a young <lb/>fellow of 19 fell into a well, and con- <lb/>tinued there above half
        an hour for <lb/>want of helpt; ſince which time his hear- <lb/>ing has been very weak; he
        has found <lb/>much benefit from being electrified, and <lb/>it is hoped will be perfectly
        cured. A <lb/>ſtone-cutter, whoſe knees and joints of <lb/>his toes had been rendered ſtiff,
        and <lb/>fingers crooked, was able to go to work <lb/>after a few days electriſation. It has
        <lb/>been found to recover, or greatly abate, <lb/>all rheumatic pains of the muſcles. A
        <lb/>lad who had a ſevere ſciatica in the <lb/>right hyp, from a fall from a ſcaffold, <pb

        <lb/>ſo as not to bear being touched, was <lb/>cured in a few days, ſo as to be able <lb/>to
        walk without a ſtaff. Another who <lb/>had uſed crutches for ſeven years, could <lb/>walk
        without them in 13 days, and <lb/>burnt them for joy. A girl of 13, who <lb/>had been lame
        after the ſmall-pox from <lb/>four years old, now walks without a <lb/>ſtaff, having been
        electrified no more <lb/>than 20 times. </p>
