        <lb/>Remarkable Account of the Cure of an <lb/>Hydrophobæa, tranſmitted to the Royal
        <lb/>Academy of Sciences <hi rend="roman">at</hi> Paris, by Dr <hi rend="roman">Le
          <lb/>Comte</hi>, Phyſician at <hi rend="roman">Rethel</hi>. </head>
      <p>
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">O</hi>N the 10th of <hi rend="italic">Jan.</hi> 1749, the che-
        <lb/>valier de ***, brig. of the <hi rend="italic">French</hi>
        <lb/>army, as he was returning from hunt- <lb/>ing, was ſuddenly attacked by a large
        <lb/>houſe dog, which ſeized him by the <lb/>left arm, and covered it with his ſlaver
        <lb/>and foam; there was no wound, nor <lb/>any pain beyond what might be tole- <lb/>rably
        endured; and this laſted till the <lb/>evening of the next day. The huntſ- <lb/>man, who
        took the dog to be mad, <lb/>by his foaming, ſhot him dead. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The chevalier, who had in a man- <lb/>ner forgotten the accident, happening <lb/>to
        hunt three weeks afterwards, was <lb/>taken extremely ill, and fainted. His <lb/>ſervants
        told him, that during his fit his <lb/>countenance was terribly disfigured: <lb/>This
        circumſtance gave him ſome ſuſ- <lb/>picion; however, he ſupp'd that night <lb/>abroad, and
        did not return home till <lb/>near one in the morning, and then he <lb/>went immediately to
        bed, and fell aſleep. <lb/>Two hours afterwards he alarmed the <lb/>whole houſe with
        terrible outcries; thoſe <lb/>who firſt enter'd his chamber found him <lb/>in a fit,
        extended on the floor: Such <lb/>ſymptoms too plainly indicated the na- <lb/>ture of his
        diſorder, and he himſelf <lb/>deſired that they would ſecure him; a <lb/>neceſſary
        precaution, for in leſs than <lb/>three hours he had a 2d fit, more vio- <lb/>lent than the
        former, and he was juſt <lb/>got out of a 4th when Dr <hi rend="italic"><choice>
            <corr>Le</corr>
            <sic>La</sic>
          </choice> Comte</hi> ar- <lb/>rived. The patient gave him an ac- <lb/>count of what had
        paſs'd, and con- <lb/>cluded with ordering him to prepare <lb/>him a medicine, with which he
        had <lb/>cured not only dogs bitten by mad ones, <lb/>but likewiſe ſeveral perſons, among
        the <lb/>reſt a girl 17 years old bit by a mad <lb/>ox, after ſhe had had two fits. The
        <lb/>doctor fearing that the chevalier would <lb/>exhauſt his ſpirits by too much talking,
        <lb/>interrupted him, by aſking him if he had <lb/>taken any liquor to recruit him after
        <lb/>his fatigue. At the bare mention of <lb/>liquor the chevalier turned pale, and <lb/>his
        face was convulſed; but this laſted <lb/>not above a minute. The doctor, how- <lb/>ever, was
        now fully ſatisfied of the na- <lb/>ture of the chevalier's diſorder, and <lb/>his
        deplorable ſituation: and tho' he <lb/>had no great opinion of the virtue of <lb/>the
        medicine he propoſed, yet being at <lb/>a loſs to ſubſtitute a better in its ſtead, <lb/>he
        conſented that the brigadier ſhould <lb/>take it.—This remedy, if the patient <lb/>has not
        had a fit, conſiſts in four drams <pb n="246"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>of calcined powder of the male oyſter <note n="‡" place="below" rend="size(0.8)">
          <p rend="indent">
            <lb/>‡ The account does not mention the ſhell, <lb/>tho' 'tis likely that is the thing
            meant, if not <lb/>for the ſhell and fiſh together. </p>
        </note>, <lb/>in about a gill of white wine, repeating <lb/>it after 24 hours; if the
        patient has had <lb/>a fit, it muſt be taken three times, at <lb/>12 hours diſtance, in the
        ſame doſe, <lb/>but in a different vehicle; inſtead of <lb/>wine, it muſt be mixed in three
        new- <lb/>laid eggs, and the patient muſt not <lb/>drink when he eats it, nor all the while
        <lb/>the medicine is operating.—The che- <lb/>valier took it, tho' with much difficulty,
        <lb/>but this did not prevent a 5th fit, which <lb/>was ſucceeded by eight more in the
        <lb/>ſpace of 16 hours.—Dr <hi rend="italic">Le Comte</hi>, who <lb/>was all the while
        preſent, ſays, that the <lb/>patient was ſenſible of the approach of <lb/>each fit, and
        would ſay, in a kind of <lb/>a ſuffocated tone, <hi rend="italic">pray retire</hi>; preſent-
        <lb/>ly his eyes were turned upwards, and <lb/>became inflamed; his face and whole <lb/>body
        terribly convulſed; he ſtrove to <lb/>bite every thing near him, and barked <lb/>like a dog,
        with his mouth full of foam, <lb/>his voice hoarſe and almoſt ſpent: Theſe <lb/>fits ended
        in a great laſſitude, in which <lb/>the patient ſeemed as a dead man, and <lb/>he came to
        himſelf with ſad inquie- <lb/>tudes, fearing he might have bitten ſome <lb/>body in his
        fit.—There is the utmoſt <lb/>reaſon to think that the medicine had <lb/>its effect. But
        after all, the waters of <lb/><hi rend="italic">Plombiers</hi> quite reſtored him to his
        for- <lb/>mer health. </p>
