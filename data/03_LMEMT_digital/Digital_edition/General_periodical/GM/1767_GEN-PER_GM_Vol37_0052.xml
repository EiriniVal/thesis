        <lb/>Obſervations concerning the Effects of <lb/>Charcoal, and other Vapours. From <lb/><hi

      <p>
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">W</hi>HILST <hi rend="italic">Van Helmont</hi>, then an <lb/>old man,
        was writing on a cold <lb/>winter's day, he ſaw his ink freeze, and <lb/>he ordered a
        chafing-diſh to be brought <lb/>him, with coals that did not ſmoke.— <lb/>He felt no harm
        from it; but his <lb/>daughter, coming in ſhortly after, and <lb/>ſaying that ſhe perceived
        a ſtrong ſtench <lb/>from the coals, the father, making a <lb/>motion for quitting the
        place, fell back, <lb/>hurt the hinder part of his head, and <lb/>was carried away for dead.
        It may ap- <lb/>pear, from this ſingular example, that <lb/>in a ſpacious place, the doors
        open, <lb/>the weather cold, without the leaſt ob- <lb/>ſervation of contracting any
        illneſs, <lb/>all the actions of a man were in a mo- <lb/>ment aboliſhed by nothing more
        than <lb/>theſe fumes. <hi rend="italic">Boerhaave</hi> relates of him- <lb/>ſelf, that
        being in a parlour, drinking <lb/>tea with ſome ladies, where there was <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>a chafing-diſh of kindled charcoal for <lb/>keeping the kettle boiling, and no
        <lb/>chimney in the place, he ſaw all the <lb/>ladies grow pale, and was ſo affected
        <lb/>himſelf by the fumes of the charcoal, <lb/>that had not the doors been opened, <lb/>he
        felt himſelf tottering, and ready to <lb/>tumble down. He likewiſe relates the <lb/>ſame
        effects on ſome young ladies who <lb/>lived in <hi rend="italic">Leyden</hi>, and were
        ſitting in a <lb/>parlour, the windows of which looked <lb/>into the ſtreet: The aunt of the
        miſ- <lb/>treſs of the houſe, looking in at the <lb/>window, gave notice of her coming by
        <lb/>tapping on the glaſs with her fingers; <lb/>ſhe ſaw through the window all the la-
        <lb/>dies ſeated and looking at her, but not <lb/>one of them making the leaſt motion;
        <lb/>ſhe repeated her taps, and ſo as to be <lb/>louder, but none of them made her any
        <lb/>anſwer; thinking they were paſſing <lb/>ſome joke on her, ſhe knock'd in a paſ-
        <lb/>ſion, at the door, calling out, that the <lb/>weather was too cold to be kept ſo
        <lb/>long in the ſtreet. On entering the par- <lb/>lour, ſhe perceived the fumes of char-
        <lb/>coal, and ſaw all the ladies pale and <lb/>ſenſeleſs; immediately ſhe ordered the
        <lb/>windows to be opened, and all their <lb/>faces to be ſprinkled with water; by <lb/>this
        means all of them ſoon recovered, <lb/>but one of them vomited, another had <lb/>a head-ach,
        yet none of them ſuffered <lb/>any thing more. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>An <hi rend="italic">Engliſh</hi> gentleman, travelling by <lb/>boat in the night, from
          <hi rend="italic">Utrecht</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Ley- <lb/>den</hi>, took with him into
        his cabbin a <lb/>ſtove, and ordered the door to be kept <lb/>ſhut: When he came to his
        place of <lb/>deſtination, the waterman, opening the <lb/>door, found him dead, with no
        other <lb/>apparent ſign than a little froth about <lb/>his mouth—Four peaſants having made
        <lb/>a fire in the hold of a ſhip, were all <lb/>found dead there.—An intire family in
        <lb/>the ſuburbs, called <hi rend="italic">de Hooge Morſch</hi>, <lb/>were found dead from
        this cauſe, by <lb/>laying, in the winter-time, a pan of <lb/>live coals in the midſt of a
        room where <lb/>there was no chimney, and the doors <lb/>ſhut. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">Boerhaave</hi> ſays, that he experienced <lb/>in himſelf, at the
        beginning of the ill <lb/>effects from ſuch vapours, an inclina- <lb/>tion to ſleep, a
        tenſive pain in the head, <lb/>a nauſea, a vomiting of thick froth, <lb/>and his head
        remaining as it were for <lb/>many days full; but if the vapour be <lb/>denſe, nothing of
        theſe particulars is <lb/>perceptible, but the affected die ſenſe- <lb/>leſs. This vapour,
        however, is not at- <lb/>tended with any inconveniency, if a <lb/>quantity of ſea ſalt is
        ſprinkled on the <pb n="53"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>fire, or if gunpowder is ſet fire to in the <lb/>cloſe room. But when the ill effects
        <lb/>have taken place, the beſt remedy is to <lb/>ſprinkle cold water on the bodies, and to
        <lb/>throw it upon the face and bare boſom. <lb/>If cold water is inſtantly thrown upon
        <lb/>animals that have died in poiſonous ca- <lb/>verns, they are immediately brought
        <lb/>to life; and hence, if men, who have <lb/>died by the vapour of coals, were as
        <lb/>ſoon as poſſible treated in the ſame <lb/>manner, they might alſo perhaps be
        <lb/>brought to life. In ſuch caſes, how- <lb/>ever, this remedy is never to be ne-
        <lb/>glected; for here there is no corrup- <lb/>tion, but a mere reſt of all the moving
        <lb/>parts, and in other reſpects nothing is <lb/>changed; if therefore they are dipped
        <lb/>into cold water, the elaſticity of the <lb/>veſſels being increaſed by the cold, the
        <lb/>blood moves towards the inner parts <lb/>through the veins; and the motion of <lb/>the
        blood through the veins reſuſcitates <lb/>its action to the heart, that is, reſuſci-
        <lb/>tates life itſelf. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The effects are not leſs noxious that <lb/>proceed from places newly white-waſh-
        <lb/>ed with lime, which diffuſes a ſub- <lb/>aſtringent and fœtid vapour, eſpecially
        <lb/>upon the introduction of fire. For this <lb/>reaſon, all newly-built houſes, if too
        <lb/>ſoon inhabited, may bring on fatal diſ- <lb/>orders, or the worſt or palſies, which
        <lb/>can neither be cured by fomentations <lb/>nor baths. Theſe ailments might like-
        <lb/>wiſe be occaſioned by burning the parts <lb/>of animals. If a place infected with
        <lb/>the naſtieſt inſects, as bugs or fleas, is <lb/>ſhut up cloſe in all parts, and the
        bones <lb/>of animals or hartſhorn are laid on the <lb/>open fire, and the ſmoak is hindered
        <lb/>to paſs out, all theſe animals are kill- <lb/>ed; and larger animals may alſo be
        <lb/>killed by the like ſmoak. The wings <lb/>of partridges, which abound with a
        <lb/>volatile ſalt, being burnt, have often <lb/>excited hyſterical paſſions, and epileptic
        <lb/>fits, where they were not, and diſſipated <lb/>them, when they were preſent. A dog,
        <lb/>killed in a heat of 146 degrees of <hi rend="italic">Fa- <lb/>renheit</hi>'s
        thermometer, emitted ſuch a <lb/>horrid and noiſome ſtench, that thoſe <lb/>who came too
        near it, in a moment <lb/>ſwooned away. In like manner, by <lb/>the force of fire, dreadful
        ſymptoms <lb/>are excited from foſſils. <hi rend="italic">Arctæus</hi> ob- <lb/>ſerves, in
        his chapter on Epilepſies, <lb/>that the ſtrong ſmell of the gagates <lb/>ſtone had
        immediately brought on epi- <lb/>lepic fits. Fire, acting on cobalt, which <lb/>ſeems to be
        intirely inert, raiſes a thick <lb/>white vapour, that kills every animal; <lb/>and this
        vapour, fixing upon the ciel- <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>ing of a room, concretes into a white <lb/>flocculent matter, called Arſenic, which
        <lb/>is a moſt potent poiſon. If this cobalt, <lb/>mixed with other foſſils, and wrapped
        <lb/>up in a paper, be kept in a wooden <lb/>box, it will eat through both the paper
        <lb/>and the box; and if this happens in ſo <lb/>ſmall a degree of heat, what muſt it
        <lb/>be, when this body is agitated by fire? <lb/>How fixed is nitre, whatever way tried!
        <lb/>If it melts in the fire, it remains fixed <lb/>and mild; if bolar or uncalcinable
        <lb/>earths are mixed with it, and both ex- <lb/>poſed to the fire, it will yield a ſpirit,
        <lb/>volatile like alcohol, which corrodes <lb/>and diſſolves all things, except gold
        <lb/>and glaſs; and it is very hurtful to the <lb/>lungs. The ſame way a ſpirit aſcends
        <lb/>from ſea ſalt, which corrodes all things. <lb/>If ſulphur be ſublimed ten times, it
        <lb/>remains mild, as before; but, if ſet on <lb/>fire, it kills animals, and corrodes and
        <lb/>conſtringes all things. </p>
