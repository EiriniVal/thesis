        <lb/>Mr. <hi rend="sc">Urban</hi>, </salute>
      <p>
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi> BELIEVE that the faſhionable prac- <lb/>tice of ſea-bathing
        ought to be uſed <lb/>with more precaution than it is. A <lb/>thin, muſcular man, as I am,
        may uſe <lb/>freedom with cold water, when a fat, <lb/>corpulent man ſhould not. I have fre-
        <lb/>quently gone into the water in a profuſe <lb/>perſpiration, after two or three hours
        <lb/>exerciſe; but then I ſtayed no longer in <lb/>the water than I would remain in a cold
        <lb/>bath. It ſometimes had the ſenſation of <lb/>ſo many pins ſtuck in every pore of my
        <lb/>ſkin; when, dreſſing myſelf immediate- <lb/>ly, and reſuming my exerciſe, I ſoon re-
        <lb/>covered my former heat. I took theſe <lb/>liberties with myſelf, becauſe I did not
        <lb/>apprehend that what an old Roman, or <lb/>a ſavage American, could ſafely bear,
        <lb/>would do a temperate Engliſhman any <lb/>hurt. Having always bathed for my
        <lb/>pleaſure, and not for my health, I muſt <lb/>own I went a little out of the common
        <lb/>track. I never go into the cold bath in <lb/>winter, as the phyſicians preſcribe, be-
        <lb/>cauſe I have not the leaſt inclination for <lb/>it, and I find myſelf, by the cold air,
        <lb/>ſufficiently braced; but in hot weather, <lb/>when, like any amphibious animal, I
        <lb/>feel a longing deſire to be in the water, <lb/>I bathe to the height of my wiſh. I
        <lb/>have ſometimes gone thrice a day into <lb/>the ſea at Brightelmſtone, which ſo ef-
        <lb/>fectually cooled me, that I have had the <lb/>moſt profound and refreſhing ſleep at
        <lb/>night, while every one elſe was com- <pb n="1036"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>plaining that he could not ſhut his eyes <lb/>for the heat. Though I am only tel-
        <lb/>ling what a lean, temperate man has <lb/>ſafely practiſed on himſelf, I believe that
        <lb/>moſt men might ſave themſelves from <lb/>fevers, if they were to bathe in cold
        <lb/>water when they feel a deſire for it, and <lb/>feel themſelves, without exerciſe, into-
        <lb/>lerably hot. A Director of the Eaſt In- <lb/>dia Company has told me, that, when
        <lb/>he commanded a Company's ſhip, he <lb/>ordered every man on board to bathe <lb/>once a
        day at leaſt, after they came into <lb/>a warm climate; to which cuſtom he <lb/>aſcribed it
        that he loſt very few men in <lb/>any voyage, while other ſhips ſuffered a <lb/>conſiderable
        loſs. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I ſaid, that the practice of ſea-bathing <lb/>ought to be uſed with more precaution
        <lb/>than it is, principally on this account,— <lb/>becauſe I believe the cuſtom, if
        diurnal, <lb/>is dangerous when it is ſuddenly left <lb/>off. I am confirmed in this belief,
        not <lb/>only from my own experience, but from <lb/>the inconvenience or misfortune which
        <lb/>others have felt. The firſt year I was <lb/>at Brighthelmſtone, I bathed, for two
        <lb/>months, conſtantly every day, after <lb/>which I was called to London in ſome
        <lb/>haſte. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>On the firſt and ſecond day after I <lb/>came to town, I had a violent head-ach,
        <lb/>felt a ſickneſs at my ſtomach, and an in- <lb/>tolerable heat. My eldeſt boy, who had
        <lb/>been with me at Brighthelmſtone, and <lb/>had bathed as conſtantly as myſelf, felt
        <lb/>the very ſame complaints, but in a much <lb/>ſtronger degree; and was affected in the
        <lb/>ſame manner as I have known ſome na- <lb/>tives of Greenland to be, who were
        <lb/>brought to this warmer climate by our <lb/>fiſhing ſhips; he vomitted, bled at the
        <lb/>noſe, and complained very much of his <lb/>head. It preſently occurred to me, that
        <lb/>the ſea-bathing having become ſo habi- <lb/>tual to us, the leaving it off too ſud-
        <lb/>denly was the cauſe of theſe complaints. <lb/>I carried him therefore to the river; but
        <lb/>I plunged in firſt, to try the experiment <lb/>upon myſelf. After dreſſing, and find-
        <lb/>ing myſelf perfectly right, I turned my <lb/>boy in next, and it cured him of all his
        <lb/>complaints. Not that he was drowned; <lb/>but that, after this remedy, he neither
        <lb/>vomited, bled at the noſe, nor com- <lb/>plained of his head. Common ſenſe <lb/>told me
        to continue that courſe, every <lb/>two or three days, till we were from the <lb/>bathing
        totally diſuſed. I told this to a <lb/>friend of mine, whoſe wife had been <lb/>ſome weeks
        at Margate, and I deſired <lb/>him to caution her not to leave off the <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>bathing all at once: but having neglect- <lb/>ed this advice, in three days after
        coming <lb/>to town ſhe was ſeized with a fever, and <lb/>in ten days more ſhe was carried
        to her <lb/>grave. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As the cold bathing in hot weather is <lb/>beneficial, ſo, in cold weather, I be-
        <lb/>lieve the hot bath can to many conſtitu- <lb/>tions do no injury, and will to moſt be
        <lb/>of infinite uſe. With regard to myſelf, <lb/>I found that it removed all obſtruction
        <lb/>in the perſpiration, and revived my na- <lb/>tural heat. I uſed to take it for my
        <lb/>pleaſure, as, in a different ſeaſon, I took <lb/>the cold bath. I have for ſeveral
        weeks <lb/>together, in the ſevereſt winters we have <lb/>had, gone into the Kingſton bath
        every <lb/>other night, and I found not the leaſt <lb/>inconvenience in walking, the morning
        <lb/>after it, two or three hours in the coldeſt <lb/>froſt. </p>
