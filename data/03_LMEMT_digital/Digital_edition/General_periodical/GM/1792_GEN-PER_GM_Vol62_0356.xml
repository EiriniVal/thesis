          >Benjamin Moſeley</hi>, M. D. <lb/><hi rend="roman">&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> (Concluded from
        p. 252.) </head>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>THE diſeaſe next under conſideration <lb/>is the <hi rend="italic">Tetanus</hi>, or <hi
          rend="italic">Locked-jaw</hi>; in which <lb/>Dr. M. has given an extenſive view of
        <lb/>ſpaſmodic affections. He recapitulates <lb/>all that has been <hi rend="italic"
          >ſaid</hi> on this diſorder, <lb/>and laments that the antients have done <lb/>but little,
        and the moderns leſs. He de- <lb/>nies, and is the firſt who has denied it, <lb/>the
        exiſtence of <hi rend="italic">Emproſthotonus</hi>; and he <lb/>proves, by the laws of
        phyſiology, the <lb/>impoſſibility of its exiſtence. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>He aſſerts, there has been no improve- <lb/>ment in the treatment of the tetanus
        <lb/>ſince Hippocrates; and that all the <lb/>vaunted methods of the moderns amount <lb/>to
        nothing but deceiving thoſe who have <lb/>relied on them. Dr. M. recommends <lb/>the revival
        of the practice of Hippo- <lb/>crates, which chiefly conſiſted in pouring <lb/>cold water on
        the naked body of the pa- <lb/>tient, and covering him afterwards, to <lb/>induce ſweating.
        But there are many <lb/>particulars to be obſerved in this prac- <lb/>tice, which Dr. M. has
        explained, and <lb/>advanced ſuch improvements as he him- <lb/>ſelf has diſcovered in the
        extenſive op- <lb/>portunities which the Weſt Indies af- <lb/>forded him. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr. M. diſcuſſes the intricate ſubjects <lb/>of <hi rend="italic">ſenſibility</hi> and
          <hi rend="italic">irritability</hi>, produces <lb/>ſome curious inſtances of
        diſcrimination, <lb/>and ſhews that the tetanus belongs to the <lb/>latter. He ſays, <hi
          rend="italic">tetani</hi>, from obſtructed <lb/>perſpiration, and night air, are
        frequently <lb/>cured by warm baths, and ſudorificks; <lb/>but thoſe from extenſive wounds,
        and <lb/>chirurgical operations, are ſeldom or ne- <lb/>ver cured by any method. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr. M. in ſpeaking of the condition <lb/>of the ſlaves in the Weſt Indies, obſerves,
        <lb/>that Negroes are more obnoxious to this <lb/>diſorder than white people; and that one
        <lb/>of the cauſes of the unneceſſary importa- <lb/>tion of Negroes from Africa ariſes from
        <lb/>the immenſe drawback on the population <lb/>of the ſlaves on account of the deaths of
        <lb/>infants by the tetanus, which is there <lb/>called the <hi rend="italic"
          >jaw-falling</hi>. He recommends <pb n="357"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>to the planters means to prevent this waſte <lb/>of human beings, which, to uſe his own
        <lb/>forcible words, <q rend="diple quotes">ſtrikes not leſs at the <lb/>intereſts of policy
          than at the concerns <lb/>of humanity. </q>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In Dr. M's diſſertation on <hi rend="italic">Local Can- <lb/>cer</hi> and <hi
          rend="italic">Cancerous Affections of the Glands</hi>, <lb/>he has obliged us with a
        ſpecifick for <lb/>their extirpation. This is an application <lb/>of corroſive ſublimate in
        powder, on a <lb/>diachylon of the gum plaſter. There <lb/>are a number of precautions
        neceſſary in <lb/>the uſe of this remedy, which can only <lb/>be decided on by the ſkilful,
        otherwiſe <lb/>great miſchief may enſue. Dr. M. uſed <lb/>this application for the
        extirpation of the <lb/><hi rend="italic">crab-yaws</hi> in the feet of the Negroes in
        <lb/>the Weſt Indies. This communication <lb/>is honourable to Dr. M's character, as
        <lb/>ſuch powerful and eaſily practicable re- <lb/>medies are generally kept ſecret, until,
        <lb/>by falling into the hands of mercenary <lb/>people, they become objects of private
        <lb/>emolument. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr. M's next diſſertation is on the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Dry Belly-ache</hi>, or <hi
          rend="italic">Colica Pictonum</hi>. He <lb/>has given us a true and genuine hiſtory
        <lb/>of this tormenting diſeaſe, the reſult of <lb/>much experience and obſervation. This
        <lb/>may be conſidered as the only one that <lb/>has ever been given to the world, if we
        <lb/>except ſome local tracts on that ſpecies <lb/>of the diſeaſe which is frequent in cyder
        <lb/>countries. The notion, that ſolutions of <lb/>lead in rum, &amp;c. produce this
        diſeaſe, is <lb/>here entirely overthrown; and the poiſon <lb/>of that metal, with a proper
        analyſis of <lb/>its principles, and its effects on ceruſe <lb/>manufacturers, ſmelters,
        painters, and <lb/>printers, are properly explained, and the <lb/>reaſons given for its
        noxious and baneful <lb/>influence. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This diſeaſe is critically defined by Dr. <lb/>M. to be <q rend="diple quotes">the
          offspring of diſeaſed ſe- <lb/>cretions, from debility in the ſtomach <lb/>and inteſtines.
          It is endemical in the <lb/>Weft Indies, and epidemical, or acci- <lb/>dental, in moſt
          other parts of the world. <lb/>It ſeldom attacks people newly arrived <lb/>in the Weſt
          Indies; and the natives <lb/>and long reſidents are almoſt always <lb/>the ſole objects of
          it. In habits of <lb/>body diſpoſed to receive it, other diſ- <lb/>eaſes will bring it on;
          ſo will coſtive- <lb/>neſs, aſtringents, bark, acids, irregu- <lb/>larity in diet, checked
          perſpiration, <lb/>anxiety, and indulging aphrodiſiacal <lb/>paſſion. </q>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Dr. M. ſhews the errors which inex- <lb/>perienced and tranſient medical people
        <lb/>have fallen into, by miſtaking the bilious <lb/>colick for this diſeaſe; and mentions
          <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>the fatal conſequences that have happen- <lb/>ed from it. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The following extract is peculiarly <lb/>important to printers:— <q rend="diple quotes"
          >Friction from <lb/>types in printing, together with the <lb/>oil in the ink, and the
          drying of the <lb/>types at the fire, cauſe an exhalation <lb/>injurious to printers.
          Uſing the letters <lb/>warm, has frequently cauſed palſies. I <lb/>have known many
          printers ſubject to <lb/>the belly-ach, while they remained in <lb/>their office, and
          always free from it <lb/>otherwiſe. A compoſitor, where this <lb/>book is now printing,
          had the belly- <lb/>ach for four months, and was in a mi- <lb/>ſerable condition until he
          applied to <lb/>me. He was cured in a few days, and <lb/>returned to his work, and
          remained <lb/>well for five months afterwards. He <lb/>had been accuſtomed to moiſten his
          <lb/>ſingers in his mouth, to take up the <lb/>letters with more facility, and alſo fre-
          <lb/>quently to put letters in his mouth, <lb/>while working; by which habit he
          <lb/>frequently ſwallowed a portion of the <lb/>ſolution of the metal in the impreg-
          <lb/>nated ſaliva. </q> p. 540, 2d edit. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The method of cure uſed by Dr. M. <lb/>is very ſimple, and conformable to all his
        <lb/>practice; in which, though we obſerve <lb/>great deciſion, yet it is always united
        <lb/>with perſpicacity. A <hi rend="italic">ſolution of white <lb/>vitriol and alum</hi> is
        one of the principal <lb/>remedies recommended for this diſeaſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The powerful effects of this combina- <lb/>tion, varying the quantities of the com-
        <lb/>ponent articles, are mentioned on ſeveral <lb/>occaſions by our author, and
        particularly <lb/>in pulmonary hæmorrhage, of which a <lb/>melancholy hiſtory is given of
        his friend <lb/>who fell a victim to this calamity. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In this very curious and intereſting <lb/>caſe, it ſeems, the effuſions of blood re-
        <lb/>gularly obeyed the periodical changes of <lb/>the moon. The caſe is recited in the
        <lb/>moſt pathetic manner, and concludes the <lb/>work. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Through the whole of this elaborate <lb/>performance Dr. M. has diffuſed an un-
        <lb/>common degree of medical and chirurgi- <lb/>cal information, excluſive of the diſeaſes
        <lb/>on which he has expreſsly written, unit- <lb/>ing, what rarely happens, extenſive
        ſcien- <lb/>tifical with extenſive practical know- <lb/>ledge. The diſeaſes which he has ex-
        <lb/>preſsly treated are of the moſt difficult <lb/>conſideration, and leaſt underſtood of
        any <lb/>in the hiſtory of medicine, and on which <lb/>he could receive no ſuitable
        information <lb/>but from his own experience and ob- <lb/>ſervations. </p>

        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">Yellow Fever</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Locked Jaw</hi>; and
        <lb/>every perſon, verſed in the ſcience of <lb/>phyſick, who ſhall read what Dr. Moſe-
        <lb/>ley has written thereon, will pronounce <lb/>the work before us one of the moſt ar-
        <lb/>duous undertakings that has ever been <lb/>executed in the medical world; widely
        <lb/>differing from thoſe crude compilations <lb/>with which the publick are frequently
        <lb/>furniſhed, the reſult, perhaps, of only a <lb/>few months voyage to the Weſt Indies,
        <lb/>or a ſhort reſidence there, conſequently <lb/>not founded on practice; and which
        <lb/>dangerous ſpeculations are, without the <lb/>leaſt regard to the miſchief they may
        <lb/>produce, recommended by their authors <lb/>as infallible guides, for the treatment of
        <lb/>diſeaſes, to the inexperienced, who can- <lb/>not, in truth, know leſs of the matter
        <lb/>than themſelves. </p>
