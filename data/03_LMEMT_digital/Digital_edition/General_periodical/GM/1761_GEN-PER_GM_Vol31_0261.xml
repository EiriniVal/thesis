        <lb/>Mr <hi rend="sc">Urban</hi>, </salute>
      <dateline rend="align-right"><hi rend="italic">June</hi>, 1761. </dateline>
      <p>
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi> Have, for many years, ſuffered a <lb/>great deal from a ſtone
        in one of <lb/>my kidneys, for which I tryed vari- <lb/>ous remedies without ſucceſs; but
        be- <lb/>in now cured, I cannot better ſhow <lb/>my thankfulneſs to God for the eaſe I
        <lb/>enjoy, than by deſiring you to publiſh <lb/>my caſe, as it may be the happy means
        <lb/>of relieving others who are in the <lb/>ſame melancholy condition. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It is, I believe, 12 or 14 years ſince <lb/>I firſt perceived a pain, uneaſineſs, and
        <lb/>weight in my left kidney, which gra- <lb/>dually increaſed till it made my life
        <lb/>very uncomfortable. As I had known <lb/>Mrs <hi rend="italic">Stephen</hi>'s medicines
        to have been <lb/>very ſucceſsful in many ſuch caſes, I <lb/>applied to her, and took her
        remedies <lb/>for ſome years, and found myſelf much <lb/>better and eaſier for them while I
        con- <lb/>tinued them, but whenever I left them <lb/>off for any time, I had a conſtant re-
        <lb/>turn of the ſame complaints. Upon <lb/>this I left them quite off, and tried ſe-
        <lb/>veral other things which were recom- <lb/>mended to me, and generally found <lb/>eaſe
        upon the firſt tryal of every new <lb/>medicine, but after leaving it off for <lb/>any
        little time, my old complaints re- <lb/>turned again. It is now above a year <lb/>ago ſince
        I left off all theſe medi- <lb/>cines, and took to lemon juice and <lb/>water, with a little
        ſugar for my con- <lb/>ſtant drink. I continued this method <lb/>for near a year with ſome
        intervals, <lb/>uſing two or three, and ſometimes in <lb/>hot weather four lemons every day,
        <lb/>and I found myſelf grow daily eaſier, <lb/>ſo that for many months I have had
        <lb/>ſcarce any uneaſineſs in my kidney; <lb/>and about ſix weeks ago I had a great
        <lb/>forcing to make water, when a kind <lb/>of jelly came from me, which, upon
        <lb/>examination, ſeemed to be the gluten, <lb/>which probably connected together the
        <lb/>ſolid parts of a ſtone. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I think it is the general opinion of <lb/>our phyſicians, that a ſtone in the hu-
        <lb/>man body conſiſts of earthy parts, <lb/>with a little alcaline ſalt and air, <lb/>which
        are connected together by a glu- <lb/>ten or glue; and that the alcaline me- <lb/>dicines,
        ſuch as ſoap and lime, diſſolve <lb/>this glue, by which means the earthy <lb/>parts
        ſeparate from the reſt, and come <lb/>away inſenſibly, but that acid medi- <lb/>cines
        diſſolve the earthy, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> parts <lb/>of the ſtone, and leave the
        glue un- <lb/>touched. And Dr <hi rend="italic">Lobb</hi>, in his treatiſe <lb/>on
        diſſolvents of the ſtone, ſhows us <lb/>by experiments, that lemon juice will <lb/>ſoften,
        and even diſſolve a ſtone. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I bleſs God I am now quite eaſy and <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>happy, and am fully ſatisfied that I <lb/>have got rid of a ſtone which gave me <lb/>ſo
        much uneaſineſs for many years; <lb/>and which, if I may judge by the <lb/>largeneſs of the
        glue which came from <lb/>me, I believe was of the ſize of a large <lb/><hi rend="italic"
          >Spaniſh</hi> nut. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The remedy I uſed was very plea- <lb/>ſant and agreeable to me, eſpecially in <lb/>the
        ſummer: I generally ſqueezed the <lb/>juice of a large lemon into a little a- <lb/>bove half
        a pint of ſoft water, and <lb/>ſweetened it to my taſte; and whenever <lb/>I was faint, or
        it was cold at my ſto- <lb/>mach, I added a little white wine to it. <lb/>It never gave me
        the cholick, which I <lb/>find lemons do to ſome perſons, to <lb/>whom, therefore, this
        remedy would <lb/>be very improper. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>If, Mr <hi rend="italic">Urban</hi>, upon this faithful <lb/>narrative of my caſe, any
        perſons <lb/>ſhould try it and be cured, I hope they <lb/>will be ſo good as to acquaint you
        of <lb/>it, that it may encourage others alſo to <lb/>try it. </p>
