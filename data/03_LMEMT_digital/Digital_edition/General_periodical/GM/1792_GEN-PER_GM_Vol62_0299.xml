        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">O</hi>N looking over the Reports of the <lb/>Lancaſhire Humane
        Society, I met <lb/>with a deſcription and print of a port- <lb/>able electrical machine, by
        Mr. Fell, <lb/>ſurgeon, Ulverſtone; which, from its <lb/>ſimplicity, ſmall ſize, &amp;c.
        ſeems ſo well <lb/>calculated for its intended purpoſe of re- <lb/>ſtoring ſuſpended
        reſpiration, that it <lb/>ought to be univerſally known. To <lb/>anſwer this end, no mode
        appeared ſo <lb/>likely as procuring it a place in the <lb/>Gentleman's Magazine; I ſhall,
        there- <lb/>fore, eſteem it a favour if you will in- <lb/>ſert a plate of it in your
        Repoſitory of <lb/>uſeful learning, ſimilar to the ſubſequent <lb/>drawing, which I copied
        from a manu- <lb/>ſcript of the author's, with permiſſion to <lb/>diſpoſe of it as I thought
        proper. The <lb/>conſtruction of this machine at the axis, <lb/>and upper part of the pillar
        next the <lb/>handle, is very improperly repreſented <lb/>by the engraver in the Reports
        above- <lb/>mentioned. I am but a bad draughtſ- <lb/>man; however, I have endeavoured to
        <lb/>copy the outline of the original with ac- <lb/>curacy; and have likewiſe tranſcribed
        <lb/>from the Reports ſo much of the de- <lb/>ſcription of the apparatus, with additi-
        <lb/>onal obſervations made by Mr. Fell, as <lb/>may be neceſſary to illuſtrate the con-
        <lb/>ſtruction. <hi rend="italic">(See pl. II. fig. 4).</hi>

        <lb/>Mr. <hi rend="sc">Fell</hi> obſerves, that <q rend="paradiple">he has long
          <lb/>thought, from ſome experiments he had <lb/>made, that the apparatus for the recovery
          of <lb/>perſons apparently dead by drowning and <lb/>other kinds of ſuffocation, would be
          more <lb/>complete by the addition of a ſmall electrical <lb/>machine, calculated only to
          give ſhocks. </q>
        <lb/>This powerful auxiliary, he finds, has been <lb/>recommended by ſeveral ingenious
        gentle- <lb/>men; and we are told that a portable elec- <lb/>trical machine has been
        contrived, for this <lb/>uſe, by Mr. Kite, and is ſold by Mr. Sa- <lb/>vigny. As many, with
        himſelf, are ſtran- <lb/>gers to the conſtruction of this machine, he <lb/>ventures to
        deſcribe one of a ſmall ſize, yet <lb/>ſufficient to produce effects adequate to the
        <lb/>deſired purpoſe. </p>
      <p rend="indent size(0.8)">
        <lb/>
        <q rend="paradiple"><hi rend="italic">Deſcription of the Machine.</hi>—Cylinder to
          <lb/>be ſix inches long, excluſive of the necks, <lb/>and four inches in diameter; whole
          length <lb/>of each of the two glaſs pillars, ſupporting <lb/>the cylinder, about nine
          inches, and one inch <lb/>diameter at bottom, and 6-8ths at top. Theſe <cb n="2"/>
          <lb/>pillars are to be covered with good ſealing- <lb/>wax, which is to be rubbed on the
          ſurface <lb/>of the heated glaſs; or with amber-varniſh, <lb/>or with linſeed oil, baking
          the glaſs in an <lb/>oven until the oil be well hardened. Cuſhion <lb/>to be narrow, and
          four inches long, and to <lb/>be preſſed againſt the ſilk and cylinder by a <lb/>ſpring,
          as ingeniouſly contrived by Mr. <lb/>Jones, optician, Holbourn. Cuſhion to be
          <lb/>ſupported by a tin tube or pillar, the lower <lb/>extremity of which is to project ſo
          far as to <lb/>be in contact with the table on which the <lb/>machine is to be
          occaſionally fixed; by which <lb/>means the neceſſity of a collecting chain will <lb/>be
          ſuperſeded. Cylinder to be turned by a <lb/>ſimple winch, which, by being made to ſlide
          <lb/>on to the end of the axis, can be reverſed in <lb/>a moment. In the place of the
          poſitive or <lb/>prime conductor, a jar, containing about 25 <lb/>or 30 ſquare inches of
          coating, is to be fixed <lb/>in a circular cup of tin, ſcrewed into the bot- <lb/>tom
          board. The uncoated part of this jar <lb/>ſhould be covered with electric varniſh. The
          <lb/>braſs wire, which touches the inſide coating, <lb/>is to paſs through cork fixed in
          the neck of <lb/>the jar. That portion of this wire immedi- <lb/>ately above the jar is,
          firſt, to ſuſtain a Lane's <lb/>electrometer; ſecondly, a braſs ball oppoſite <lb/>to a
          ball of the electrometer; and, laſtly, on <lb/>its ſuperior extremity, a ſtraight piece of
          <lb/>braſs or iron of the lenght of the cuſhion, <lb/>and made with a ſharp edge facing
          the cylin- <lb/>der; or, inſtead of the ſharp edge, it may be <lb/>furniſhed with four or
          five ſhort and pointed <lb/>pieces of wire, to collect the electricity. <lb/>The lower
          horizontal part of the electrome- <lb/>ter, which is glaſs, ſhould be covered with <lb/>an
          electric varniſh. It will be more eligible <lb/>to place one of the conducting chains or
          <lb/>wires at the lower part of the electrometer, <lb/>in order to prevent the hazard of
          drawing or <lb/>ſeparating the balls of the inſtrument ſo far <lb/>aſunder as to produce a
          much greater ſhock <lb/>than was intended; beſide, in this ſituation <lb/>the glaſs will
          not be in the ſame danger of <lb/>being broken by any ſudden effort. The <lb/>two chains
          or wires to conduct the ſhocks <lb/>ſhould be about four or five feet long each.
          <lb/>Directors to be each 10½ inches long, and <lb/>without braſs balls at their ends, as
          they are <lb/>only to convey ſhocks. Their wires to be <lb/>ſtrong, rounded at the ends,
          and about three <lb/>or four inches long. The extremity of each <lb/>glaſs handle to be
          rounded, and half an inch <lb/>in diameter, and to taper gradually for the <lb/>length of
          an inch, in order to make them <lb/>ſtand firm and upright, when not uſed, in <lb/>two
          holes made in the bottom board on each <lb/>ſide of the jar. The addition of a clamp,
          <lb/>piece of tallow-candle, ſmall box of amal- <lb/>gam, and round piece of leather on
          card pa- <lb/>per, completes the apparatus. Theſe five <lb/>articles may be lodged
          ſecurely in excava- <lb/>tions made in the bottom board. </q>

          &amp;c. our firſt attention <lb/>ſhould be directed to the inflation of the pa-
          <lb/>tient's lungs. When the diſtenſion of the <lb/>lungs is accompliſhed, let the
          powerful ſti- <lb/>mulus of electricity be applied, by paſſing a <lb/>ſhock through the
          heart, the balls of the <lb/>electrometer being no more than a third or <lb/>half an inch
          from each other. Continue to <lb/>repeat the ſhocks at every time the lungs are <lb/>in a

          hours in the uſe of theſe means <lb/>before the firſt ſigns of life have appeared.
          <lb/>The electrical ſhock, when it produces con- <lb/>tractions, is conſidered by ſome as
          a teſt of <lb/>ſome remains of life; but this criterion is <lb/>doubted by others: for
