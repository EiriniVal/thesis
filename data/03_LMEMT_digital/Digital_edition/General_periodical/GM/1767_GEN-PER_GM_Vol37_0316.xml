        <lb/><hi rend="roman">5.</hi> Medical Advice to the conſumptive <lb/>and aſthmatick people
        of <hi rend="roman">England</hi>; where- <lb/>in the preſent method of treating diſorders
        <lb/>of the lungs is ſhewn to be futile and fun- <lb/>damentally wrong, and a new and eaſy
        <lb/>method of cure, propoſed by <hi rend="roman">Philip Stern, <lb/>M. D.</hi>
        <hi rend="roman">1s. Almon.</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The purpoſe of this advice is to re- <lb/>commend a noſtrum invented by the
        <lb/>author. It is a ſolution of certain <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>balſams in a certain chemical liquor, <lb/>which he ſays is very volatile, not at
        <lb/>all inflammatory, and remarkably an- <lb/>tiſceptic, and antiſpaſmodic. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This medicine he applies immediately <lb/>to the lungs by putting a few drops of
        <lb/>the ſolution into boiling water, and <lb/>cauſing the patient to draw in the <lb/>ſteam
        with his breath; to facilitate the <lb/>operation, he has contrived a machine, <lb/>of which
        a repreſentation is prefixed <lb/>to his book. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>He conceals his medicine, he ſays, <lb/>for no other reaſon than becauſe if he <lb/>was
        to diſcover it ſo as that it might <lb/>be prepared by every apothecary, it <lb/>would be
        neglected. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>If this anſwer is thought inſuffi- <lb/>cient, he confeſſes that he has no bet-
        <lb/>ter to give. Another, however, tho' <lb/>not a better, will naturally be ſuſ-
        <lb/>pected. However, it is much to be re- <lb/>gretted, that medicines thus offered to
        <lb/>the publick are not by appointment <lb/>of the legiſlature examined by per- <lb/>ſons <choice>
          <corr>properly</corr>
          <sic>peoperly</sic>
        </choice> qualified to aſcertain <lb/>their inefficacy or utility. That on <lb/>one hand, a
        uſeful diſcovery might <lb/>not be diſregarded as the impoſition <lb/>of a quack; and on the
        other, that the <lb/>weak and credulous might not be de- <lb/>frauded of their money for
        ſomething <lb/>that is uſeleſs, if not hurtful to their <lb/>health. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The pamphlet is well written, and <lb/>the author has himſelf given the fol-
        <lb/>lowing excellent rules for judging <lb/>properly of medicines which are ex- <lb/>poſed
        to ſale by perſons who conceal <lb/>their ingredients. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">firſt</hi> general rule is, never to <lb/>pay the leaſt regard to
        the canting <lb/>of thoſe who pretend, that the good <lb/>of mankind is their ſole motive
        for <lb/>offering their medicine to ſale. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">Secondly</hi>, diſregard all aſſertions con- <lb/>cerning the
        excellency of a medicine, <lb/>which are mere aſſertions, without <lb/>any foundation in
        reaſon and experi- <lb/>ment. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">Thirdly</hi>, conclude the advertiſer to <lb/>be either a knave or a
        fool in phy- <lb/>ſick, who pretends, that his medicine <lb/>will cure ſeveral diſorders
        which have <lb/>not the leaſt analogy to each other. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/><hi rend="italic">Fourthly</hi>, give no credit to the reci- <lb/>tal of <hi
          rend="italic">caſes</hi>, as they are generally in- <lb/>vented by the doctor. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>And <hi rend="italic">laſtly</hi>, when the doctor writes <lb/>a pamphlet, with an
        intention to re- <lb/>commend his medicine, if it betray a <lb/>manifeſt ignorance of his
        ſubject, of <lb/>ſtyle, and grammar; in ſhort, when <pb n="317"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>his language is evidently that of a <lb/>porter, conclude him to be ſome illi-
        <lb/>terate, ignorant perſon, whoſe medi- <lb/>cine and opinions deſerve no attention. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>What he ſays of himſelf it would <lb/>be injurious to ſuppreſs. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>
        <q rend="quotes">Concerning myſelf, and the medi- <lb/>cine I recommend, I do not expect,
          <lb/>that the reader ſhould have any depend- <lb/>ance on what I may have aſſerted in the
          <lb/>preceeding pages; becauſe, if he has <lb/>any knowledge of mankind, he has
          <lb/>reaſon to ſuppoſe, that I have ſacrifi- <lb/>ced the truth to intereſt and a
          favourite <lb/>hypotheſis. My aſſertions however <lb/>are very few, except what relates to
          <lb/>the experiment to prove the antiſcep- <lb/>tic quality of this vapour; but as it
          <lb/>is in every one's power to repeat the <lb/>experiment, it will be an eaſy matter
          <lb/>to convict me of falſehood or confirm <lb/>the truth. All I expect of the reader
          <lb/>is, that he will impartially conſider the <lb/>reaſons, upon which I have founded
          <lb/>my expectations of curing diſorders <lb/>of the lungs by means of this balſa-
          <lb/>mic vapour. If he is of opinion, that <lb/>I have reaſoned juſtly, he will certain-
          <lb/>ly think it adviſeable for thoſe whoſe <lb/>lungs are injured, to try the experi-
          <lb/>ment, eſpecially as it cannot poſſibly <lb/>be attended with any danger; and as
          <lb/>to the expence, it will certainly be <lb/>thought moſt inconſiderable, when
          <lb/>compared with the fees of a phyſician, <lb/>and the bills of an apothecary. </q>
