        <lb/>Strictures on the Uſe of Soap Lees, and <lb/>Lixiviums, in the Cure of the Stone. </head>
      <p>
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>T is a matter of no ſmall moment, to <lb/>conſider how quacks,
        and even regu- <lb/>lar practitioners have <sic>adobted</sic> the uſe of <lb/>a medicine, ſo
        injurious to the conſtitu- <lb/>tion, as Soap Lees, and Lixiviums, to <lb/>cure the Stone;
        for being of a corrod- <lb/>ing quality, it is injurious to the ſto- <lb/>mach and bowels to
        a very great degree, <lb/>hurts their nerves, and robs them of their <lb/>neceſſary mucus,
        ſupplied by nature to <lb/>preſerve them, ulcerates the glands, and, <lb/>by a long
        continued uſe, will induce a <lb/>putreſcent diſpoſition into the habit, <lb/>which will
        ſhew itſelf by eruptions, and <lb/>other ſymptoms common to the ſcurvy; <lb/>nay, ſo
        injurious is a long continued <lb/>uſe of it, that in delicate conſtitutions, <lb/>it will
        bring on irrepairable decays; and <lb/>after all, though it is capable of giving <lb/>ſome
        relief, it ſeldom, very ſeldom, <lb/>anſwers the purpoſe deſired, <hi rend="italic">of
          perform- <lb/>ing a cure</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>This medicine was brought into prac- <lb/>tice firſt by Dr. <hi rend="italic"
          >Jurin</hi>, who being much <lb/>diſeaſed with the ſtone, took Lixiviums, <lb/>found eaſe
        by it, wrote upon it, ima- <lb/>gining it a cure, and gave it to many <lb/>with unequal
        ſucceſs; and it was gene- <lb/>rally allowed, that the doctor killed him- <lb/>ſelf by the
        long continued and free uſe <lb/>of it. After which, from the chain of <lb/>experiments made
        on Lime water, by <lb/>the ingenious Dr. <hi rend="italic">Whytt</hi>, together with
        <lb/>the caſe of the honourable Mr. <hi rend="italic">Wal- <lb/>pole</hi>, the uſe of
        Lixiviums, and Soap <lb/>Lees, was dropt, to make way for Lime- <lb/>water, a more ſafe, but
        equally uncer- <lb/>tain medicine. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>From this time, Lixiviums lay neg- <lb/>lected, till Mrs. <hi rend="italic"
          >Stevens</hi>'s ſoap medicine <lb/>became the object; when by Dr. <hi rend="italic"
          >Hales</hi>'s <lb/>annaliſation of this ſoap, he proved by <lb/>experiments, that the
        ſolvent power of <lb/>the medicine could be attributed only to <lb/>the large portion of
        lixivial ſalts that <lb/>were in it, that all Lixiviums were ſimilar <lb/>in their effects;
        that the unctuous body <lb/>neceſſary to the forming in into ſoap, did <lb/>but clog, and
        abate the efficacy of it; <lb/>and as Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Stevens</hi>'s medicine proved
        <lb/>fallible, procuring eaſe (generally ſpeak- <lb/>ing) ſo long only as the uſe of it was
        <lb/>continued, it was a hint ſufficient to bring <lb/>Soap Lees, and Lixiviums, into uſe a-
        <lb/>gain. Upon this they proceeded, but <lb/>to leſſen the biting quality of it, it was
        <lb/>neceſſary to join the lees with mucilagin- <lb/>ous fluids; ſuch as broth, decoction of
          <pb n="340"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>mallows, linſeed, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> by which me- <lb/>dium it might be
        taken into the ſto- <lb/>mach, without ſudden injury to it; af- <lb/>ter this manner, it is
        now much uſed <lb/>under the notion of an improvement. <lb/>I wiſh I could congratulate the
        gentle- <lb/>men in phyſic on the ſuppoſed acquiſi- <lb/>tion; they will find that by laying
        aſide <lb/>the combination of an unctuous body <lb/>with it in Soap Lees, they give a medi-
        <lb/>cine capable of much injury, which if <lb/>adminiſtered in the form of a ſoap, pur-
        <lb/>poſely prepared for medicinal uſes, they <lb/>would not only have a ſafe medicine,
        <lb/>equally efficacious, but in many caſes <lb/>more ſo than Soap Lees. But before we
        <lb/>quit the ſubject, let us try, by experi- <lb/>ment, what benefit we can derive from
        <lb/>the uſe of Soap Lees, as a ſtone ſolvent; <lb/>let any perſon take a fragment of human
        <lb/>ſtone, and immerſe it in broth, linſeed <lb/>tea, or the like, impregnated in the
        <lb/>ſame proportion with the like number <lb/>of drops of Soap Lees, as the patient
        <lb/>takes at one time, this let him repeat, <lb/>and it will convince him (unleſs the
        <lb/>ſtone uſed is of a particular ſoft tex- <lb/>ture) how little the ſolvent power of
        <lb/>Soap Lees, or Lixiviums, is to be de- <lb/>pended upon. He will find a glaſs of
        <lb/>punch a better ſolvent. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>And repeating the injury I have men- <lb/>tioned it is capable of doing to the vi-
        <lb/>ſcera, let him at the ſame time he makes <lb/>an experiment on the ſtone, put a piece
        <lb/>of bladder, or gut, freſh taken from <lb/>ſheep, hog, or ox, with it, and by re-
        <lb/>peating the doſe of Soap Lees, with <lb/>broth poured to it, as often as he takes
        <lb/>it himſelf, he will diſcover alſo in what <lb/>time the gut or bladder will become
        <lb/>rotten. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>[<hi rend="italic">This letter having been communicated <lb/>to Mr. <hi rend="roman"
            >Blackrie</hi>, the ingenious author of <lb/>an eſſay lately publiſhed on medicines for
          <lb/>diſſolving the ſtone, in which he has ana- <lb/>lyſed Dr. <hi rend="roman"
            >Chittick's</hi> noſtrum, and recom- <lb/>mended Lixivial medicines, with proper
          <lb/>caution and reſtrictions, he has promiſed <lb/>to take ſome notice of the objections
