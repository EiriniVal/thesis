        <lb/>Mr. Sherwen, an ingenious ſurgeon <lb/>and apothecary of this place, whoſe
        <lb/>accuracy and judgment I can confide <lb/>in, as I have not yet had an opportu-
        <lb/>nity of examining this phænomenon <lb/>myſelf. The child's father has the <lb/>conduct
        of a paper-mill by the ſide of <lb/>Enfield Marſh, and is I believe about <lb/>36 years of
        age: his mother about 42, <lb/>and at preſent of a healthy habit; nei- <lb/>ther of his
        parents remarkable for <lb/>their ſize or ſtature. They have had 5 <lb/>children: the eldeſt
        of the three now <lb/>living is 12 years old, and rather ſmall <lb/>of his age; but his
        paternal grandfa- <lb/>ther was of a ſize larger than ordinary. <lb/>They had another ſon of
        uncommon <lb/>proportion, who died of the meazles <lb/>in Jan. 1774, at the age of 15
        months; <lb/>the carpenter who made his coffin ob- <lb/>ſerved, that he had never meaſured
        ſo <lb/>tall a child. The preſent ſubject, be- <lb/>ing the ſecond of the kind, excites a
        <lb/>greater degree of curioſity, of which <lb/>the father intends to avail himſelf, by
        <lb/>carrying the child up to London, and <lb/>making a public ſhew of him. </p>

        <lb/>In the year 1744-5, Dr. Mead <lb/>laid before the Society an account of a <lb/>gigantic

            <lb/>* His weight was gueſſed at nine ſtone. </p>
        </note>. He could therefore only ſay, <lb/>that, when ſhe expoſes his legs, thighs, <lb/>and
        broad back to view, it is im- <lb/>poſſible to be impreſt with any other <lb/>idea than that
        of ſeeing a young giant. <lb/>The boy had very fine hair, pure clear <lb/>ſkin, free from
        pimple or blemiſh: <lb/>he is extremely lively, and has a <lb/>bright clear eye, the pupil
        not in the <lb/>leaſt dilated; and, excepting a pair of <lb/>broad cheeks, his head is
        rather leſs <lb/>in proportion than his other parts. <lb/>From theſe circumſtances Mr. S.
        ven- <lb/>tures to prognoſticate, that he is as like- <lb/>ly to arrive at maturity

      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Soon after the date of the above let- <lb/>ter, the boy was carried to a relation's
        <lb/>in Great Turnſtile; but the confined <lb/>ſituation had ſuch an effect on his
        <lb/>health, that he was ſoon brought back <lb/>into his native air. He has now been <lb/>in

        <lb/>was not remarkable when born, but <lb/>at about ſix weeks after began, and <lb/>has
        rapidly continued, to encreaſe to <lb/>his preſent amazing ſize. His coun- <lb/>tenance is
        what every one would call <lb/>comely, but with rather more expreſſion <lb/>in it than is
        uſual at his age, though <lb/>exceedingly pleaſing from his being <lb/>uncommonly well
        tempered. He is <lb/>to be ſeen from eleven in the morning <lb/>till four, at Mr. Owen's,
        Confectioner, <lb/>No. 66, Cornhill." </p>
