        <lb/>Extract from a Book lately publiſhed by <lb/><hi rend="roman">John Chandler</hi>, F. R.
        S. on Colds, very <lb/>neceſſary to he attended to at this Seaſon <lb/>of the Year. </head>
      <p>
        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">I</hi>T is often to be remarked (ſays our <lb/>author) that perſons
        upon their re- <lb/>turn from the country, at this ſeaſon <lb/>of the year (whether earlier
        or in the <lb/>more advanced part of it) to this great <pb n="525"/>

        <lb/>metropolis; very ſoon after their ar- <lb/>rival, find themſelves ſeized with colds
        <lb/>without having perceived the leaſt <lb/>ſymptom of any ſuch complaint, while <lb/>in
        the country; or without any alte- <lb/>ration of weather, after coming to <lb/>town; which
        they are apt the more to <lb/>wonder at, as they take it for certain, <lb/>that the air in
        general muſt be warmer <lb/>here than it was there; both from the <lb/>numberleſs buildings
        which encloſe it, <lb/>and from the multitude of fires con- <lb/>ſtantly kept up by the
        inhabitants: <lb/>But this, although true, yet is, acci- <lb/>dentally, the very cauſe of
        the com- <lb/>plaint. The whole body of the atmoſ- <lb/>phere in town is conſtantly in a
        ſtate <lb/>of preternatural rarefraction; con- <lb/>ſequently the cooler and more conden-
        <lb/>ſed air of the country, muſt be per- <lb/>petually ruſhing in, as into a vacuum,
        <lb/>from all ſides, and create an artificial <lb/>wind: Moreover, the buildings, e-
        <lb/>rected in all directions, are ſo many <lb/>ſtops to the free currency of the air,
        <lb/>which is reverberated and circulated <lb/>thro' the ſtreets, lanes<choice>
          <corr>,</corr>
          <sic/>
        </choice> courts, and allies, <lb/>and from church yards, and other wide <lb/>openings, and
        hereby occaſion ſo ma- <lb/>ny ſtreams and eddies of wind, which <lb/>not only meet perſons
        without doors <lb/>in almoſt every poſſible poſition, but <lb/>alſo encounter them in the
        paſſages <lb/>and ſtair-caſes of their own houſes, <lb/>and drive through every aperture of
        <lb/>the chambers they reſide in; and this <lb/>happens under the diſadvantageous
        <lb/>circumſtance of the body's being more <lb/>warmed, and perſpiration more in-
        <lb/>creaſed by the greater poſitive warmth <lb/>of the atmoſphere; which, until they
        <lb/>are ſettled and accommodated to their <lb/>changed ſituation, by ſome longer ſtay,
        <lb/>naturally expoſe them to the very in- <lb/>conveniencies they complain of: To
        <lb/>avoid which, all weakly perſons, or o- <lb/>thers ſubject to catch cold, and alſo
        <lb/>young children, ſhould be uſed to prac- <lb/>tice every precaution mentioned, re-
        <lb/>lative to ſuch accidents, upon their <lb/>firſt eſſays to go or be carried abroad.
        <lb/>They ſhould alſo be admoniſhed againſt <lb/>frequenting raw, uninhabited rooms, <lb/>or
        delaying on paſſages or ſtair-caſes; <lb/>and children ſhould be reſtrained from
        <lb/>playing about ſuch dangerous places, <lb/>eſpecially in damp weather, or after <lb/>the
        houſes have been waſhed; both <lb/>which, from certain ſtated punctuali- <lb/>ties of
        cleanlineſs obſerved in this <lb/>country, or to ſatisfy female nicety, <lb/>frequently
        happen together, and give <lb/>occaſion to hoarſeneſſes, ſore-throats, <lb/>coughs and
        fevers. </p>
      <cb n="2"/>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>It is very hard, that the more or- <lb/>derly part of our ſpecies ſhould be <lb/>moſt
        of all expoſed to miſchiefs of this <lb/>ſort, then, when they are in the way <lb/>of their
        duty; and methinks it ſhould <lb/>not a little import all thoſe, whoſe of- <lb/>fices it may
        reſpectively concern, to <lb/>conſider this matter, in relation to the <lb/>waſhing of
        churches, and other places <lb/>ſet apart for divine worſhip; which is <lb/>generally done,
        within a little more <lb/>than twelve hours, before the meet- <lb/>ing of the congregation.
        Some proper <lb/>care to render all ſuch places more <lb/>ſafe, by keeping them more free
        from <lb/>that rawneſs and dampneſs which muſt <lb/>neceſſarily enſue from the preſent and
        <lb/>long eſtabliſhed cuſtom, would ſurely <lb/>juſtify the novelty of ſome change
        <lb/>herein; not only as it would be more <lb/>conſonant to good ſenſe, and to hu-
        <lb/>manity, but alſo, as it might be a <lb/>means to leſſen, if not prevent, the <lb/>many
        interruptions and diſturbances <lb/>in the celebration of thoſe ſolemn ſer- <lb/>vices,
        ariſing from the pulmonary <lb/>weakneſſes, or other more recent diſ- <lb/>orders of the <hi
          rend="italic">trachea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bronchia</hi>, in <lb/>various perſons,
        which, in the winter <lb/>ſeaſon, more eſpecially, there is ſo <lb/>much ground for others
        to complain of. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Whenever, in one or the other ſea- <lb/>ſon, the weather be rainy or moiſt, it <lb/>is
        right to keep up a moderate fire in <lb/>all our inhabited rooms, more eſpe- <lb/>cially in
        the evening and night times, <lb/>and where perſons are accuſtomed to <lb/>employ
        themſelves, either in their <lb/>ſtudies or counting-houſes. It is alſo <lb/>prudent to have
        a fire kindled in every <lb/>room, ſtatedly uſed for dining, reti- <lb/>ring, or reſt, after
        it has been waſhed; <lb/>as it prevents the damp vapours, which <lb/>ariſe while it is
        drying, from flying <lb/>up and bedewing the cieling; fixing <lb/>in drops on the furniture,
        and trick- <lb/>ling down the wainſcotting; or from <lb/>hovering about the room, by abſorb-
        <lb/>ing and directing their courſe up the <lb/>chimney; moreover, all ſuch rooms
        <lb/>ſhould be thoroughly dry, before any <lb/>perſon ventures to ſit, ſtand, and a-
        <lb/>bove all, to ſleep in them; he will be <lb/>more eſpecially liable to receive miſ-
        <lb/>chief by it, when warmed, and put <lb/>into a ſtate of increaſed perſpiration, <lb/>by
        exerciſe of any kind; or rather ha- <lb/>ving been in a warm ſituation, either <lb/>from the
        ſun, or common fire, or <lb/>when heated by any degree of intem- <lb/>perance from meats or
        wine. </p>
