        <lb/>cure of lunaticks, has been attended <lb/>with very conſiderable ſucceſs, and may
        <lb/>be eaſily followed with equal advan- <lb/>tage in other parts of the kingdom, it
        <lb/>will not be foreign I hope to the de- <lb/>ſign of your Magazine, to publiſh <lb/>their
        grounds and motives for entering <lb/>upon this uſeful work, and the man- <lb/>ner in which
        it hath been and is now <lb/>conducted. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The truſtees of the public infirmary <lb/>in Mancheſter (erected in the year <lb/>1752)
        found it extremely inconvenient <lb/>to admit poor lunaticks as in-patients, <lb/>and
        therefore, in conformity with all <lb/>other infirmaries, excluded, by their <lb/>rules,
        thoſe miſerable objects from be- <lb/>ing admitted as <hi rend="italic">in-patients</hi>. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Theſe rules, however, did not deter <lb/>many humane perſons from frequently
        <lb/>ſolliciting the truſtees to take the caſe <lb/>of <hi rend="italic">poor lunaticks</hi>
        once more under con- <lb/>ſideration, with a promiſe of contri- <lb/>buting very generouſly
        towards any ex- <lb/>traordinary expence that might be in- <lb/>curred by admitting them.
        Thus preſt <lb/>upon and encouraged, they could not <lb/>forbear turning their attention
        this way, <lb/>to which they were farther moved by <lb/>the following conſiderations: </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>In the firſt place, they apprehended <lb/>that no caſes could be more truly de-
        <lb/>plorable than thoſe of poor lunaticks, <lb/>who had in common no proſpect of a
        <lb/>cure, and who had beſides no care or <lb/>attendance upon their perſons but what <lb/>a
        needy parent could beſtow, or what <lb/>a thrifty pariſh-officer could provide, <lb/>at the
        ſame time that they continued <lb/>public ſpectacles of the deepeſt miſery, <lb/>if not of
        terror, to their neighbours; <lb/>they had moreover in view the aſſiſt- <lb/>ance which they
        might reaſonably hope <lb/>to give to many perſons of middling <lb/>fortunes, who, labouring
        under the <lb/>terrible misfortune of an <hi rend="italic">unſound mind</hi>, <lb/>had no
        place to reſort to but a <hi rend="italic">private <lb/>madhouſe</hi>, where their cure
        ſtood a <lb/>great chance of being protracted (for <lb/>the benefit of a mercenary keeper),
        if <lb/>ever to be accompliſhed, by one who <lb/>could lay ſo ſmall a claim to medical
        <lb/>abilities. Theſe perſons, or their re- <lb/>lations, they could not doubt would
        <lb/>gladly give the preference to an <hi rend="italic">aſylum</hi>
        <lb/>of this kind, conducted by men of <lb/>principle and honour, where the pa- <lb/>tients
        might expect to meet with the <lb/>moſt humane and diſintereſted treat- <lb/>ment; and
        where, though a moderate <lb/>fee was taken by the truſtees for their <lb/>ſubſiſtence, and
        by the phyſician for <lb/>his advice, they might happily be re- <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>ſtored to their health and friends, with- <lb/>out impairing their fortunes. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>Accordingly, by the benefactions <lb/>which came in, in the year 1765, they <lb/>were
        enabled to erect and furniſh a <lb/>building ſolely for the uſe of luna- <lb/>ticks; and
        likewiſe to provide a go- <lb/>vernor and governeſs, with proper ſer- <lb/>vants entirely to
        attend upon them: <lb/>but the money ſubſcribed being little <lb/>more than what was
        expended in the <lb/>houſe and furniture, they found them- <lb/>ſelves obliged to exact a
        weekly ſum <lb/>from the relations of each patient, or <lb/>from their pariſh officers, for
        their <lb/>board and maintenance; which, ſel- <lb/>dom exceeding five ſhillings a week
        <lb/>for paupers, eight or ten ſhillings for <lb/>thoſe in middling condition, and one
        <lb/>guinea per week for perſons of for- <lb/>tune, was gladly ſubmitted to; and <lb/>has
        enabled them, by the number of <lb/>patients which have been ſent in, <lb/>fully to obtain
        their deſired end, the <lb/>phyſicians of the Infirmary, and the <lb/>ſurgeons, when
        neceſſary, having ge- <lb/>nerouſly given their advice and aſſiſ- <lb/>tance to the poorer
        ſort <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>. Such, <lb/>indeed, has been their ſucceſs, that it
        <lb/>has been found neceſſary, the laſt year, <lb/>to add upwards of twenty new cells to
        <lb/>the twenty-two at firſt erected. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>The truſtees of the Infirmary, and <lb/>all contributors of 50l. or upwards, <lb/>are
        appointed governors; but the im- <lb/>mediate care and management is com- <lb/>mitted to
        twenty-one perſons, choſen <lb/>out of the truſtees of the Infirmary an- <lb/>nually, of
        which five are a quorum. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>No recommendation is required for <lb/>the admiſſion of any patient into this <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">hoſpital</hi>, if a place may be ſo called, <lb/>where every man pays, in
        ſome mea- <lb/>ſure, for his ſubſiſtence. Two friends <lb/>of the patient, or, if paupers,
        the over- <lb/>ſeers of the poor, are only to ſend a <lb/>petition, duly ſigned, to the
        truſtees of <lb/>the Infirmary at their weekly board, <lb/>ſetting forth the age, ſex, and
        condi- <lb/>tion of the patient, and deſcribing the <lb/>caſe as far as they well can; upon
        <lb/>which the ſecretary will return an im- <lb/>mediate anſwer; and if the patient,
        <lb/>upon examination of the phyſician, <lb/>ſhall be found a proper object, <hi
          rend="italic">he</hi>, or <lb/><hi rend="italic">ſhe</hi>, will be admitted. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>As this hoſpital is favoured with <lb/>frequent benefactions and legacies, the
        <lb/>truſtees have a proſpect of being able, <lb/>in time, to admit the poor gratis. <hi
          rend="italic">A <lb/>conſummation devoutly to be wiſhed</hi>. </p>
