        <lb/><hi rend="dc(2)">Y</hi>OUR Review on Dr. Bree's En- <lb/>quiry on diſordered
        Reſpiration <lb/>induces me to ſend you my caſe, as it <lb/>may throw ſome additional light
        on <lb/>the ſubject, and aſſiſt thoſe labouring <lb/>under the like complaint with what I
        <lb/>find relief from. Nearly 20 years ago, <lb/>I was attacked with a pain about the
          <lb/><hi rend="italic">præcordia</hi>, and a ſhortneſs of breath, <lb/>but not conſtant. I
        applied to two of <lb/>the faculty perſonally, and, by letter, <lb/>to a third. The firſt
        ſaid the complaint <lb/>was ſeated in the heart; no immediate <lb/>danger, but remedileſs.
        The phyſi- <lb/>cian written to preſcribed hemlock; <lb/>which I took for ſome time without
        ei- <lb/>ther good or bad effect. I began after <pb n="295"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>this to find all ſtrong ſcents diſagree <lb/>with, me, particularly perfumes (<hi
          rend="italic">mare- <lb/>ſchalle</hi> the moſt terrible enemy of all); <lb/>and all kinds
        of ſpice in food; ſome- <lb/>times my ſpeech was taken away for <lb/>hours; at others the
        paroxyſm ſo vio- <lb/>lent as to threaten ſtrangulation, the <lb/>veins in my face and
        throat ſwelling <lb/>with the convulſive ſtruggles, and <lb/>would long ſince, probably,
        have ter- <lb/>minated my exiſtence by the rupture <lb/>of a blood-veſſel, if (thanks to
        God, <lb/>and the memory of a dear deceaſed <lb/>phyſical relation,) I had not been ac-
        <lb/>quainted with the virtues of laudanum. <lb/>I take (in water) from 7 to 20, 30, 40
        <lb/>drops, or more, according to the vio- <lb/>lence or duration of the paroxyſm; <lb/>not
        that I, or thoſe about me, ever <lb/>loſe time in counting the exact num- <lb/>ber, as the
        quantity may be pretty <lb/>well gueſſed at (though I would not <lb/>adviſe any perſon
        unacquainted with <lb/>this medicine or its effect to do ſo), <lb/>which in a little time
        tranquillizes the <lb/>agitation of the whole ſyſtem, and I <lb/>am reſtored to perfect eaſe
        and compo- <lb/>ſure, except, ſometimes feeling a little <lb/>laſſitude after a very violent
        fit. I muſt <lb/>add this particular, that, in what I <lb/>call an extreme bad one, it ſo
        far re- <lb/>ſembles the <hi rend="italic">hydrophobia</hi> (which, as <lb/>one of your
        correſpondents ſome time <lb/>ago very juſtly remarked, ſhou'd rather <lb/>be termed <hi
          rend="italic">dyſpepſia</hi>), the ſwallowing of <lb/>liquids is ſo exceeding painful,
        from <lb/>the difficulty of breathing, that I have <lb/>held the cup, containing what I knew
        <lb/>to be my only remedy, for a moment <lb/>or two with a degree of dread, till I
        <lb/>ſummoned my utmoſt reſolution. In <lb/>this it differs too from a fit of the aſth-
        <lb/>ma, that it is not relieved by a draught <lb/>of ſtrong coffee or tea; for, when it
        <lb/>had been brought on at the time of <lb/>drinking thoſe refreſhments by the ar-
        <lb/>rival into the company of ſome perfu- <lb/>med beau or belle, I have attempted <lb/>in
        vain to ſwallow either, or to drink <lb/>any more in the courſe of the day. <lb/>And here
        give me leave to hint to the <lb/>faculty to avoid the uſe of perfumes, <lb/>as I have
        frequently ſuffered by thoſe <lb/>gentlemen. When my complaint has <lb/>been brought on by
        inadvertently <lb/>ſwallowing ſpice in cookery; I have <lb/>ſometimes found acids relieve
        me. I <lb/>am very ſure ſerous phlegm has no- <lb/>thing to do with my diſorder; nor can
        <lb/>I think it any ſpecies of aſthma, nei- <lb/>ther foggy, thick, or froſty, weather
        <lb/>brings it on; nor do I find it more in <cb n="2"/>
        <lb/>London; and I can go up a ſteep hill or <lb/>ſtairs without the leaſt inconvenience. I
        <lb/>do not pretend to phyſical, much leſs to <lb/>anatomical, knowledge; but I appre-
        <lb/>hend the complaint is occaſioned by an <lb/>extreme quick circulation of the blood,
        <lb/>as my pulſe almoſt conſtantly beats <lb/>near 100 ſtrokes in a minute without
        <lb/>being in the leaſt feveriſh. When <lb/>from any ſtimulation this velocity is
        <lb/>increaſed, I imagine the <hi rend="italic">impetus</hi> is too <lb/>great for my heart,
        if I properly ex- <lb/>preſs it, as I feel an immediate pain <lb/>there. I do not much think
        there is a <lb/><hi rend="italic">polypus</hi>, or any kind of formation, as I <lb/>can
        ſleep on it; beſides, I ſhould ſup- <lb/>poſe, in that caſe, there would be a <lb/>conſtant
        uneaſy ſenſation and weight. <lb/>Whether there is any degree of oſſifi- <lb/>cation, or
        varicoſe veins or arteries, <lb/>neither I, nor the moſt ſkilful anato- <lb/>miſt, I ſhould
        ſuppoſe, could aſcertain <lb/>whilſt I am alive. I have no doubt of <lb/>the ſoundneſs of my
        lungs, but fancy <lb/>they are not ſtrong, as my voice is not, <lb/>nor can I read aloud for
        any length of <lb/>time. If I am excited to laughter, it <lb/>is rather painful; ſighing
        exceedingly <lb/>ſo; but, as the latter is a voluntary <lb/>emotion, I can refrain from it;
        nor <lb/>am I ſubject to a depreſſion of ſpirits, <lb/>for which, in ſome meaſure, I may
        <lb/>thank the quickneſs of my circulation; <lb/>though I have the vanity to think I
        <lb/>poſſeſs much mental courage and reſo- <lb/>lution, if I may be allowed to make a
        <lb/>difference betwixt mental and bodily <lb/>courage. My ſtate of health has been,
        <lb/>excluſive of this complaint, good, ſince <lb/>it has come upon me; I have never
        <lb/>had a fever or cough, though liable to <lb/>both when young. Accuſtoming my- <lb/>ſelf
        to a great deal of air preſerves me <lb/>from catching cold; and I am neceſ- <lb/>ſarily
        obliged to a moderate diet. Wa- <lb/>ter has been my conſtant beverage for <lb/>many years,
        though I do not find a <lb/>glaſs of wine occaſionally hurts me; <lb/>but it would, no
        doubt, be highly im- <lb/>proper for me to habituate myſelf to <lb/>any diet that would tend
        to increaſe <lb/>the quantity of my blood. When it <lb/>has unfortunately happened that my
        <lb/>breath has met with repeated attacks, <lb/>and I find it continues ſhort for ſome
        <lb/>days together, I purſue a vegetable <lb/>diet for a time. </p>
      <p rend="indent">
        <lb/>I have occaſionally mentioned my <lb/>being ſo diſordered from the effect of <lb/><hi
          rend="italic">effluvia</hi> to the Faculty (for I have ne- <lb/>ver, ſince the beginning
        of it, con- <lb/>ſulted any for relief from it, as I form <pb n="296"/>
        <cb n="1"/>
        <lb/>no hope of a cure), when they almoſt <lb/>always uſe that indefinite term <hi
          rend="italic">ner- <lb/>vous</hi>; and, ſome years ago, I was <lb/>over-perſuaded by a
        friend to take <lb/>aſafœtida drops, by recommendation <lb/>from her apothecary, under that
        no- <lb/>tion; but it had like to have <hi rend="italic">effectually</hi>
        <lb/>cured me. Indeed, very few medi- <lb/>cines would agree with me, either from <lb/>their
        diſagreeable or aromatic taſte. I <lb/>have formerly attempted both cold and
        <lb/>ſea-bathing; but, as it generally gave <lb/>me an intenſe head-ach, eſpecially if I
        <lb/>plunged in, my deceaſed relation told <lb/>me I endangered rupturing ſome blood-
        <lb/>veſſel. His laſt kind advice was, to uſe <lb/>my own reaſon; which tells me to
        <lb/>keep myſelf as tranquil as poſſible, <lb/>though I cannot ſay a hurry of ſpirits
        <lb/>affects my breath in particular. On re- <lb/>peruſal of your account of Dr. Bree's
        <lb/>publication, I find you ſay you cannot <lb/>ſpecify with accuracy the <hi rend="italic"
          >effluvia</hi> of <lb/>many articles you ſuſpect injurious to <lb/>ſome conſtitutions. In
          <hi rend="italic">my</hi> catalogue, <lb/>heated iron, ſuch as Regiſter, and Bu-
        <lb/>zaglo's ſtoves, are inimical to me; <lb/>warm vinegar; all freſh paint; white <lb/>leſs
        ſo than coloured; bread juſt drawn <lb/>from the oven; new hay; fœtid ſmells <lb/>not quite
        ſo bad as thoſe of a pleaſanter <lb/>kind, perhaps not ſo ſubtle; nor a <lb/>ſmoky fire
        worſe than in common to <lb/>every one; rice I never found any <lb/>ſmell in; only paſſing
        by a druggiſt's <lb/>ſhop, when they have had any power- <lb/>ful drugs opened, has given me
        a fit; <lb/>and a diſtiller's will give me a ſlight <lb/>touch, but I generally ſtop my noſe
        <lb/>and haſten by all thoſe dangerous bu- <lb/>ſineſſes. This account, Mr. Urban, I
        <lb/>leave to your judgement to publiſh to <lb/>your medical readers, if you think it
        <lb/>will be of any utility to the inveſtiga- <lb/>tion of the ſubject. </p>
