I Shall not trouble my self, or the Reader, 
in this small Tract, with the many dif- 
ferent and indeterminate Notions of the 
Natural Cause of this Distemper, as to its 
Original Production, whether it be (as some 
have undertaken to make out) meerly the 
effects of Divine Wrath and Judgment, in- 
flicted on Mankind as a Scourge for their 
|P_2
wanton and lustful Debaucheries; or whether 
(as others strenuously assert) it was contract- 
ed by the carnal Conjunction of some Scabby, 
Leprous, or other sort of unclean Persons; or 
whether deriv'd to us from the Spaniards, 
Neapolitans, Italians or French; I say, I shall 
not spend time about those Definitions which 
are only speculative, and tend more to sa- 
tisfie the Curious, than to edifie the Neces- 
sitous; and it being what I shall amply and par- 
ticularly discourse on in my general Treatise, 
intended shortly to be Publish'd, I purposely, 
for brevity sake, pass them by. 

Neither is it pertinent to my present De- 
sign, to relate here, Where, or from What
this Distemper owes its Original, or How, or 
When it came to be spread over the greatest 
part of the World, it being sufficient, and 
too notorious, that we know it to be a com- 
mon Disease, which, tho' it may arise by ma- 
ny Ways and Accidents, yet now a-days is 
gotten for the most part, by the impure and 
carnal Embrace of an infected Person, and 
the Child of an unclean Parent may bring 
the Distemper into the World with it, and 
that Child infect the Nurse that Suckles it, 
and the Nurse her Husband, &c.

Or the Nurse infected, may infect the Child 
that is sound, Children whose Flesh is more 
lax, and Pores more open than grown Persons 
are, being much sooner liable and apt to receive 
the Infection, and that not only by Sucking a 
polluted Nurse, but also by the Slaver, in 
being kiss'd by those foul Sluts that have Ve- 
|P_3
nereal Ulcers in their Throats, or Mouths, 
as too many miserable Instances have made 
manifest. 

I say, it is sufficient that we know it to be a 
Distemper daily gotten, and indeed so very 
frequently now, that as certain Author 
takes notice, it is undeniable that the Pox in 
this loose and dissolute Age, is more propa- 
gated in one Day, than an hundred Years ago 
it was in a Month, and the number of Vene- 
real Patients consequently multiplied. 

And indeed so universal is the Distemper 
now become, that it is almost as much a won- 
der to hear of many Persons that never had it, 
or that never had taken the way to get it, as 
it was formerly a wonder to hear of any in- 
fected; and so obnoxious were the People in 
those Days that had the Pox, that I have 
somewhere read, they were oblig'd, when it 
came to be known, under a severe Penalty, to 
withdraw themselves from the City, or Town, 
where they dwelt, to a certain Place appoint- 
ed (as are our Hospitals) for their Reception 
and Cure, and there to be kept close confin'd, 
left their Society and Conversation should 
infect others, the Distemper then being thought 
by most as equally infectious as the Plague, 
and the People were altogether as equally a- 
fraid of it. 

And Sennertus tells us, that Jul. Palmarius
writes in his Book de Lue Vener. cap. 5. That 
the Pox at its first rise, was reported to be so 
filthy, that that which reigns now is scarce 
thought to be of the same kind; for then 
|P_4
those infected, had innumerable Ulcers, rough 
and bunching out in the figure and bulk of 
Acorns, from which flowed a filthy Humour, 
of such a stinking exhalation, or smell, that the 
Noses of those that smelt it, were believ'd to 
be presently infected. The colour of those filthy 
Pustles was between black and green, the 
sight of which was much tormented and terrified 
the Patient, as did their grievous Pain. There- 
fore all People did shun the sight of them, 
and more avoided touching them, than any 
thing belonging to any Disease besides. 

And that in China, as I have been told by 
a Gentleman now my Patient, who for a 
considerable time liv'd there, the Venereal 
Infection is call'd the Lazarus, and affects 
those that have it with a contraction of the 
Fingers, &c. and breakings out in the Body, 
particularly with thick Scabs all down the 
Thighs and Legs, like the Distemper call'd 
the Farcy in Horses, and that they are very 
unsightly, painful and loathsome, and are 
seldom, if ever, Cured, if the Infection be 
great, or arives to its height of inveteracy. 

This infectious Evil, says an Author, raged 
by Wholesale in the American Islands, and 
(tho' I thought not to mention these matters 
here, as before hinted) was brought from 
thence into Europe by the Spaniards there, 
but from whence it came so as to infect the 
Americans, that is, from whence this Disease 
sprung ab Origine, or had its first beginning, 
is the great Question in dispute. 

|P_5
Dr. Martin Lister says, it is to be believ'd, 
that it proceeded at first, either from the Bi- 
ting of some Venomous Animal, or from some 
Food certainly Poysonous; it being very well 
known that the Americans freely eat certain 
Serpents, (of which innumerable new Species or 
Kinds are amongst the Indians unknown to us) 
and so either from the Poysonous Nature of 
that their impure Diet, or the Bitings of those 
Poysonous Serpents, (as from the Biting of a 
Mad-Dog, an Hydrophoby is occasion'd) either 
says he, from that external or internal Cause 
was the Venereal Disease certainly bred, 
which when once begotten, infected afterwards 
with a Contagion. 

And he tells us, that Consalvus Oviedus a No- 
ble Spaniard, makes the same Observation, who 
among all the Spaniards was the most faithful 
Historian of the Nature of Things, and was 
for many Years one of the chief Governours 
of those Islands; of him there are some Books 
extant, although many written by him are 
lost; and was a Man as Cardan allows, to be 
compared with Ancient Writers; and among 
the other Animals, which he mentions to be 
in West-India, he exactly describes the Ingu- 
anas to be no mean little Beast of the kind 
of four footed Serpents, upon which the 
Indians fed greedily, accounting them a 
Dainty; therefore the Spanish Men after 
their example, put them into their Food also, 
their taste being not in the least displeasing, 
but on the contrary, more savoury than the 
Flesh of Rabits; and says, that the eating of 
|P_6
them hurted no Body, unless such who had 
been infected with the Venereal Lues, and 
those, although they had long before been 
Cured thereof, it presently offended, and at 
length did stir up and renew the Disease, as 
if the same had lain only dormant; and this, 
says he, our Men experienc'd by innumerable 
examples. 

And for that reason, says Dr. Lister, 'tis 
not so absurd to believe, that this Lues had 
its Original from the like, if not from the 
self-same Causes, when surely by the eating 
of them, forthwith the Malady revives, dead 
as it were long before. 

And the more, says he, am I confirm'd, 
because the secret Parts of either Sex in- 
fected with this Disease, even when other 
Symptoms are wanting a great while, are be- 
set with certain Tufts, thick-Tooth'd, like 
Cocks-combs, just like those in the Serpent 
Inguanas, whose Body commonly is all over- 
laid with Crests of that sort; certainly a pro- 
per representation from what Animal that 
Distemper deriv'd its being. But those crested 
Maladies, perhaps are reckoned by others, a- 
mongst the swelling Inflammations of the Fun- 
dament and Hæmorrhoids, because those are 
commonly visible without any pain or cer- 
tain tenuity of the Membrane. 

It is common, says he, that Poysonous Ani- 
mals also imprint proper and peculiar Cha- 
racters of their Contagion; for Example, a 
Barking in Hydrophobia, caus'd by the Biting 
of a Mad-Dog, also a Dog-like voracity of 
|P_7
swallowing, with an aptitude of licking, rather 
than drinking, by a continual putting out of 
the Tongue. Also by the biting of a Flea, like 
a Spider call'd Tarantula, is caus'd a constant 
desire of leaping; neither is the goings of those 
Spider-like things, other than after the man- 
ner of Fleas, viz. a skipping from one place 
to another. I am not Ignorant indeed that 
this may be accounted a Fable by some, even 
Learned Men; but certainly, says he, not so 
by me, to whom the customs of Spiders, are 
a little more diligently consider'd than others; 
yea, that kind of Spiders may be afforded in 
hot Countries, as Calabria, by which most 
pernicious bitings may be inflicted: indeed 
the History of the Nature of those things is 
only begun, and therefore, says he, I wonder 
not so much that that, and innumerable Phæ- 
nomena's of that sort, are hid from us, and 
justly suspected. 

Moreover, says he, they who have eaten 
a Sea Lepus, (that is a kind of naked Sea-Hare, 
of a purple Colour, found even in our Sea) 
make a purple colour'd Urine; and in their 
sleep, ever and anon seem to hear the Waves 
of the beaten Shores, and their Bodies be- 
come livid; this Fish is reckon'd to be Poyson 
to Man, and Man to him, as Scribonius, Dios- 
corides and others, say. 

Thus does this Author say of those men- 
tion'd, and other Poysons, how that they im- 
print the like upon the Person, that has either 
been bitten by them, or has eaten of them; 
to shew how the possibility of the Venereal 
|P_8
Infection, from those Poysonous Animals, may 
be infus'd, and that it might be propagated 
at first from Beast to Man, and so transferr'd 
from Man to Woman, or Woman to Man, 
to what we daily find it to be now; and thus 
he states the Original of the Venereal Lues. 

Firovanti will not allow that this Disease 
was brought from the West-Indies, but on the 
contrary affirms, that the French first got it 
at the Siege of Naples, by feeding upon dead 
Mens Carkasses, which Diet they were forc'd 
to take up with, being almost famish'd; and 
as a proof thereof, says he, feed but a Sow 
with Sows Flesh, or an Owl or a Whelp with 
the Flesh of their own Kind, and they will be 
mark'd, as he has try'd and found, with 
Blotches, Spots and Pimples, even like those 
of the Pox. 

Paracelsus says, the Disease was bred be- 
tween a French Leper, and a Neapolitan Whore, 
when she had her Courses upon her. 

Others again report, that a Leper of Valentia, 
Hispania Tarraconensi, was the first that gave this 
Disease, and that it was to a Noble Whore, of 
whom he purchas'd a Nights Lodging for Fifty 
pieces of Gold, and that she since had dispers'd 
it among many others. 

And some (as Dr. Harvey, &c. from others) 
say. that it was first caus'd by Greek Wine, dash'd 
with Lepers Blood, which the French drank, being 
purposely left them at Suma by the Spaniards. 

But Divines, especially some of them, im- 
pute the rise of it to God Almighty's Judgment 
upon Adulterers, Fornicators, and other sin- 
ful Criminals. 

|P_9
The most Learned Leonicenus, and Fracas- 
torius, and certain others, were of the Opini- 
on, that the rise of the Venereal Disease was 
Epidemical, and proceeded from a common 
Cause, for that at its first beginning, Boys, 
Men, Old-Folks, Girls and Women, were in- 
fected, without any Communication or Here- 
ditary Disposition: and that the said Fracas- 
torius writes in his Book, de Morbo Gallic. 
cap. 7. that tho' the greatest part of Man- 
kind, in his Time, had contracted the Dis- 
ease by Contagion, yet it had been observed, 
that Numbers of others were infected Epi- 
demically, without recieving it, or contracting 
it, from any one. And thinks it impossible, 
that in so small a time, the Contagion (which, 
says he, of it self is slow and not easily re- 
ceiv'd) could spread it self over so many 
Lands, when at first it was brought but by 
one Fleet of the Spaniards. 

But if it was so, that it was at first 
brought to us from America upon the dis- 
covery and conquest of that part of the 
World, and that it was not known in Eu- 
rope before, as it has happen'd, it has prov'd 
to us an untoward Conquest in that respect, 
as Mr. Tate in his Epistle to Dr. Thomas 
Hobbs, before his Poetical Translation of 
Syphilis, or the French Disease (written in 
Latin by that Famous Poet and Physician 
Fracastorius) well observes, viz.

Dear was the Conquest of a New found World, 
Whose Plague e'er since thro' all the Old is hurl'd. 
|P_10
[/1./]If then by Traffick thence this Plague was brought, 
How dearly dearly was that Traffick bought! 

Others impute its Original rise to the 
Stars; others to the inundation, or over- 
flowing of the River Tyber, the Air being in- 
fected by the Corruption of several Creatures, 
which the Waters had cast up and left upon the 
Shore, &c. And thus we see Tot Homines quot 
Sententia, many Men many Minds, for that those 
that lived about the time of the first beginning 
of the Disease, cannot agree in their Judgments 
about the true rise thereof; and if they could 
not then, what must we do now, that live more 
than 2 Ages after them? As therefore it would 
take up a great deal of Time and no small 
Pains, to enquire into the Validity or Proba- 
bility of those several Conjectures, (which I 
cannot stand here to do, and consequently 
give my own Sentiments about) shall defer 
it till a proper opportunity, which will be, 
as before hinted, in my other Book promis'd, 
only shall observe what a Gentleman in his 
Commendatory Verses upon the aforesaid 
Mr. Tate, upon his Translation of Syphilis, 
says, viz.

Blame not the Stars; 'tis plain it neither fell, 
From the Distemper'd Heavens, nor rose from Hell. 
Nor need we to the distant Indies rome; 
The Curst Originals are nearer Home. 
|P_11
Whence should that foul infectious Torment flow, 
But from the baneful Source of all our wo? 
That wheedling, Charming Sex, that draws us in, 
To every Punishment, and every Sin. 

Some say it is a Distemper very Malignant, 
Poysonous and Contagious, others differ so 
much from that Opinion, as to say, the high- 
est degree of Infection has no Malignity in it 
at all, and that whenever they meet with a 
Patient that has a Clap, do, as fast as possible, 
administer Medicines to stop the Running, 
without any regard to what other Symptoms 
occur, for that when the Running once ceases, 
all the other Symptoms, (which, as they alledge, 
ever spring only from the Running) go off in 
course, without any detriment to the Patient. 
But let those that believe so, do so if they will, I 
am satisfy'd, and too many unfortunate Peo- 
ple can very readily agree with me, that it is 
the only sure way to Pox the Patient, and 
when once that is done, the Symptoms and 
Consequences, will speak too plainly how far 
they have been in the wrong, and what in- 
jury they have done the poor Patient. Seve- 
ral Instances of which kind, the Reader will 
observe, before he gets to the end of this Book. 
But this by the way. 

Persons in Years may also be infected by 
the immodest open-Mouth'd, lascivious Kis- 
sings of Venereal People, especially those of 
them that have Ulcers in their Mouths or 
Throats, and where at the same time they 
dwell as it were upon their Lips and Mouths, 
|P_12
reiterating wanton, unseemly Kisses, thereby 
conveying their slimy, infectious Slaver, to 
such; I say, grown Persons by that means 
may, and frequently have gotten the Vene- 
real Distemper, but then generally they have 
been observ'd to complain of their Throats 
first, it seizing them after the same manner, 
as if some Cold had been taken, the Saliva of 
the Pocky Person communicating its infectious 
Steams no farther at first, than about the Glan- 
dules in those Parts, and which if not speedily 
minded, Inflames, Ulcerates, and spreads its 
Infection to the no small damage of the Patient. 

To this way of Infection, also a certain 
Learned Author assents, who says, that if it be 
received only by Kissing of the Lips, it Blos- 
soms there first, and appears with Scabby Erup- 
tions, and a sore Mouth or Throat; but if it 
be gotten by the Tail, 'tis not presently Cha- 
ractered in the Face or other Parts, but stays 
some time in the lower parts, the place of its 
Conception and Birth, and afterwards upon 
neglect or ill management, or both, Travels in- 
to other Regions of the Body, and appears here 
and there, with variety of ugly Shapes, and un- 
wholsome Salutes to its new Quarters, such 
as Pains, Pimples, Itch, Spots, Scurf, Scabs, &c. 

But Infections this way, that is, by Kissing, 
are soon cured, if taken in time; indeed in 
Children much more difficultly, what with 
their not being suspected by the Parent or 
Attendant, of having any such Infection, and 
also not being capable of complaining, and 
their tenderness (as observ'd before) much 
|P_13
sooner attracting the Taint, it is the more 
easily diffus'd and radicated, than in grown 
Persons, which with their incapacity of going 
thro' a Method that is proper, renders them 
consequently much harder of Cure, as the fol- 
lowing Instance will demonstrate. 

A Child that I had in hand, some Years since, 
upon sucking a Wet-Nurse, to whom it 
was put out in the Country, grew ill, ac- 
companied with breakings out all over the 
Head and Face, (the Child being perfectly 
well when it went from Home) I going one 
Day to see it, and taking notice of the Nurse, 
observ'd she had a sore Eye; upon a narrow 
inspection of it, I had sufficient cause of sus- 
picion, whereupon I examin'd her concerning 
it, and tax'd her with having the Distemper, 
which at first she denied, but afterwards when 
I had told her I was positive it was so, and de- 
clared to her my Reasons for it, (other Symp- 
toms concurring) and at the same time urg- 
ing her to acknowledge it; she, with some 
Reluctancy and Shame confessed the whole 
matter, saying, she got it from her Husband, 
who (by the Character I afterwards heard of 
him) I do believe was only in the Fault, not 
but that the Nurse was exceedingly to blame, 
and indeed very indiscreet and base to take the 
Child to Suckle, when (whatever Excuses she 
made to the contrary) she could not but before- 
hand be sensible of her Condition; but notwith- 
standing all the prudent endeavours, and ne- 
cessary means that could be used, as well by the 
Prescripions, of an Eminent Physician, as my 
|P_14
own, to save the poor Infant, it daily 
grew worse and worse, and soon after died in 
a most miserable condition, to the no small 
trouble of the tender and honest Parents, 
whose Grief, as may easily be suppos'd, was 
so much the more aggravated, as the manner 
of its Death was woful and unexpected. 

This single instance, without enumerating 
others of the like kind, which have occurr'd in 
my Practice, may serve for a Caution to Pa- 
rents to be wary and careful what Wet-Nurses 
they choose, and also to wholesome Nurses 
what Children they take to Suckle, the dan- 
ger being almost equal both to the one and 
the other, since many Children that are Born 
of Venereal Parents, bringing the Distemper 
into the World with them, do, upon being 
put out to Nurses to Suckle, very often con- 
vey the Infection; as was the condition of a 
Nurse that I lately Cured, who by giving Suck 
to a Pocky Child, of about two Months Old, 
had her Breasts all over spread with a Humour, 
beginning first at the Nipples, which swell'd 
the Glands, and Tumified, before she so much 
as imagin'd what should be the Cause thereof; 
till upon growing worse, with breakings out, 
Inflammation and Pain, she sought for help, and 
was told it was Venereal; and making appli- 
cation to me, by the recommendation of ano- 
ther, I soon recover'd her to her Health, which 
she now enjoys. 

Likewise a good sober Woman, who had Suck- 
led several Gentlemen's Children, to their great 
satisfaction, as good a Nurse perhaps as can be, 
|P_15
upon giving Suck to a Child, seemingly 
as she thought, very Healthy, (only had some 
breakings out about it, which the Mother 
said was only Heat and sharp Humours) was ex- 
ceedingly infected with the Pox, all her Nip- 
ples breaking out, her Throat sore, with Ul- 
cers, a Hoarsness and Pains about her, &c.
at first she did not mind it, not in the least 
suspecting any harm; but when it invaded her 
Throat, causing Hoarsness, as also Pains in her 
Limbs, and breakings out on the Privy Parts, &c.
she began to fear, and came for my Advice; 
for her Cure I advis'd to a Salivation, which 
she is now preparing for, and will go into 
as soon as the Ulcers in her Throat are so 
well amended as to give leave. 

Also divers others of the like Infections 
have happen'd in my Practice, to the Disad- 
vantage, and sometimes Ruin, both of Nurses 
and Children, the smallest Species of the 
Disease being sufficient many times, especi- 
ally in Children, and other tender Constitu- 
tions to infect either, by which means many 
Families have been undone, who not knowing 
for a long time what has ail'd them, and lit- 
tle dreaming of such a Distemper, or the pos- 
sibility of getting it that way, have been 
drill'd along in a mistaken Course, till (when 
too late perhaps) it has been discover'd that 
their Distempers were Venereal. 

And 'tis not to be doubted, but that num- 
bers of Persons, more especially Children, are 
yearly destroy'd in this City, by means of 
that Disease, notwithstanding they pass in the 
|P_16
Bills of Mortality for Fevers, Convulsions, Con- 
sumptions, Gripings in the Guts, Rickets, King's- 
Evil, Worms, Teeth, and the like; tho' at the 
same time it might be, that they died of 
those Distempers, but then too often caused 
by, and complicated with, the Venereal In- 
fection, so as justly enough to be term'd Pocky 
Consumptions, Pocky King's-Evil, &c. and indeed 
it is great pity poor innocent Babes, (they al- 
ways faring the worse under such a Disaster) 
should be (as they too frequently are) depriv'd 
of their Lives, and at the best of their Healths, 
by the barbarous Treatment of their polluted 
Attendants; who, tho' they too well know 
before-hand what Distempers they have upon 
them, will for the lucre of a little Money run 
the hazard of the Childrens Lives. 

And not only do Children become Sufferers 
by Wet-Nurses, but also by Nursery-Maids, 
many of whom, however passing for modest 
Persons, have secret Venereal Infirmities 
upon them, which they too often communi- 
cate to the Children they lie with, whose 
open Pores by Sweating, do attract those in- 
fectious Steams, and which has soon after ap- 
pear'd, as I have observ'd in several Children, 
either by breakings out about the Body, Sore- 
Eyes, Swellings, or after some other manner 
discovering it self, so as not to be doubted 
but that it is Venereal, and which for some 
time perhaps has not been in the least suspec- 
ted by the Parents, to be what it has proved; 
for which reason Parents can never be too 
careful what Servants they take to Bed with, 
|P_17
and bring up their Children, since so many 
Mischiefs by means thereof, have too demon- 
strably accrued; among several of which that 
I could recollect, I shall take notice only of 
one, that happen'd but very lately, and is as 
follows, viz.

A Nursery-Maid that had the Care of the 
two youngest Children of an eminent Shop- 
keeper in this City, committed to her, was 
one Day observ'd by some of the Family, to 
have divers Medicines in her Trunk, as Pills, 
Electuaries, Powders, Balsams, &c. and being 
ask'd what she did with them? she answer'd, 
that she always kept such by her, in case any 
illness should happen to her, pretending that 
she had great skill in Distempers; some short 
time after this, the two Children she attend- 
ed grew ill, with loss of Stomach, being 
hot and feverish, and upon one of them arose 
a Swelling under the Ear, and in one of the 
Arm-pits, which render'd it very froward; 
the other had Sore-Eyes and Breakings-out in 
many places of the Head, Face and Body, 
attended with a violent hot, sharp Humour 
upon the lower Parts; in short, both of them 
were so bad, that notwithstanding the en- 
deavours of an Apothecary that was employ'd 
to administer to them, they grew worse and 
worse, upon which he advis'd them to a Sur- 
geon, and mentioning me, I was sent for; 
when I was there, after inquiring into their 
Conditions, ask'd what they had taken? 
which, when I had been inform'd, and being 
what was proper, told the Parents, I wonder'd 
|P_18
those attempts should prove fruitless, and 
that their Cases must needs be rebellious to 
resist those Medicines; besides it was some- 
thing unaccountable that two Children (who, 
as I was told, were ever till then very heal- 
thy) should fall ill, almost all of a sudden, 
and after such a manner, and wish'd it was 
no hurt; upon which they ask'd me what I 
meant by saying so? I presently enquir'd for 
the Person that attended them; and she that 
lay with them being in the Room, I ask'd 
her how she did, for that I suppos'd she was 
their Bed-fellow, and whether she had any 
Breakings out? she immediately answer'd no, 
and that she lay with them, but for her part 
was as well as ever she was in her Life: so I 
said no more, but after ordering what they 
should do at home for them, and telling the 
Parents I would send what was necessary, 
went away. After I was gone, the Parents 
were uneasie at my Expressions, not knowing 
what I meant, which the Servant that had 
seen the Medicines in the Nursery-Maids 
Trunk, observing, told her Mistress thereof, 
and said, she fear'd the Nursery-Maid had 
given the children some Physick that had 
done them harm; upon this, they immedi- 
ately calls and asks her, but she positively 
denyed it; but suspecting something of the 
Matter, would needs see her Trunk, where- 
in among many Boxes and Pots, &c. they 
found a written Paper of Directions for the 
taking her Medicines, and dressing her Sores 
in the Groins and other Parts; and they re- 
|P_19
membring my Words, ask'd her what Dis- 
temper she had? and sent immediately away 
for me. When I came, I found them all a- 
larm'd, and after telling me what had oc- 
curr'd, ask'd my Opinion, upon which, I told 
them plainly, I believ'd their Children had 
got the foul Disease, but how they came by 
it I knew not, unless by lying with the Nur- 
sery-Maid. It was thereupon agreed that I 
should examine her, which accordingly I did, 
but she with a great deal of Confidence de- 
nied it, and not only so, but that she would 
make me prove my Words; but however, the 
more she denied it, the more I asserted it, and 
what with urging her, threatning her, and tell- 
ing her I was sure what I said was true; she began 
to relent, and at last told me her Condition, and 
how she came by the Infection, but still upon my 
promise of Secrecy, and that I would inter- 
cede with her Master and Mistress for her, 
which I did, who after some exclamations and 
sharp reprimands, discharged her of their 
Service. This Creature had a Sore, Scabby 
Head, which run much, had an Ulcer in each 
Groin, and several Sores besides, attended 
with malignant Eruptions in several other 
parts of her Body, which by lying between 
the two Children, one of them about two, 
the other above three Years old, and Sweat- 
ing often with Medicines which she said she 
took, must needs have convey'd the Infection 
to them, and which, under God, I set them 
free from, tho' not without a great deal of 
difficulty, and no small time; but so deplo- 
|P_20
rable were their conditions, that I often 
fear'd the Success, they for a long time ap- 
pearing to all, especially one of them, more 
likely to die, than to live. 

A Child also of an Apothecary that was 
infected by the nasty Slavering of a Pocky 
Servant-Maid that attended it, it appearing 
in the Child's Mouth, which was grievous 
Sore, I Cured; as also the Wenches ulcera- 
ted Throat and Hoarsness, which she at first 
call'd a Cold: But I shall not enumerate In- 
stances here, intending to enlarge further 
concerning those Matters in my general Trea- 
tise aforemention'd, which I have now made 
such a Progress in, as that it will soon be 
ready for the Press, the Title-Page and Con- 
tents of which is (for the satisfaction of 
some that may be desirous to know in 
what Method I treat thereon) affixed at the 
end of this Tract: In which Treatise I shall 
also for the benefit of the Publick, shew the 
Methods I generally pursue, and prescribe 
the Medicines I usually administer in the 
Cure of this Disease. 

Many are the ways assign'd by Authors of 
the Propagation of the Venereal Distemper, 
several of which, (as I shall by and by men- 
tion) seem very absurd and irrational, and 
which I should particularly here enlarge upon 
and shew the fallacy of, but for brevity sake, 
I having never in all my Practice, (which has 
been none of the least) observ'd any one 
Person really to have gotten the Disease those 
ways, tho' I have made the most exact En- 
|P_21
quiry into several Patients, who (to screen 
their Guilt) have endeavour'd to amuse me 
therewith, tho' afterwards confess'd the con- 
trary: Those Authors asserting that the Di- 
stemper is to be gotten by barely lying in 
the same Bed with an infected Person, (of 
which I shall anon say more) or after such in 
the same Sheets, or by wearing their Cloaths, 
Gloves, &c, or by sitting presently after 
them on the same Close-stool, or by Drink- 
ing out of the same Pot or Glass immediate- 
ly after them, or by receiving the Breath of 
infected Persons, by talking with them, or 
the like, which tho' nothing be more com- 
mon, than that the Patient to avoid the 
Shame and Disgrace of having gotten it by 
Copulation, will pretend, and work some 
(especially over-credulous or ignorant Peo- 
ple) into the belief of, and at the same time 
please themselves to see them impos'd upon, 
(as certain Matrons which Gabriel Fallopius
in his Book De Morbo Gallico, cap. 10. takes 
notice of Scoffingly, who having the Vene- 
real Distemper, and willing to be accounted 
chast, would have it believed by their Phy- 
sicians, &c. that they got it by sprinkling 
themselves with Holy-Water, which some 
Pocky Persons had polluted) yet is what Men 
skill'd in the Distemper can quickly see thro' 
and detect; and indeed are such ridiculous 
Fancies, that I have often wonder'd any 
should take up with and believe them; for 
besides my own Observations, I never by all 
the Enquiries I have made of Men of Busi- 
|P_22
ness, could learn that any of them ever met 
with one that really was infected those ways; 
and the more I have improv'd in the Know- 
ledge of the Venereal Disease, the more I 
have been convinc'd of the impossibility there- 
of; for were such a thing possible, how uni- 
versally would the Distemper be spread? how 
many hundreds, I may say thousands, would 
be daily in danger of getting it? and how 
few by this time would have escaped it, I 
leave all Persons to judge? but the Reasons 
those Authors assign to maintain their Opini- 
on, are no other than what are easie to be 
confuted, and indeed so weak and groundless, 
as not worth Time and Pains to take notice 
of. 

The same Authors likewise assert that the 
Distemper may be, and frequently is gotten 
in Coition, between a sound Man and a sound 
Woman, by their too much forcing the Sper- 
matick Vessels, and over-heating the Parts, 
especially the Prostate Glandules; but this al- 
so is without the least colour or shew of Rea- 
son: indeed a Gonorrhæa, or Running, may 
be procured thereby, and is what very often 
happens by the weakning of the Spermatick Ves- 
sels, and disposing them to receive sharp Hu- 
mors, but yet is ever attended with diffe- 
rent Symptoms, than usually appears when 
the Case is Venereal; for the Seeds of one Man 
and one Woman in Coition that are Sound, 
can never degenerate into a Contagious or 
Venereal Ferment; the Laws of Nature be- 
|P_23
ing always uniform, and which (as one ob- 
serves) are no ways capable of alteration, 
otherwise than for the generating a Natural 
Birth, or some other Production; or if it 
happens that some disposition be wanting for 
such a generation, those Seeds then are on- 
ly lost, but never produce any Bodily harm, 
at least no Contagious or Venereal Distem- 
per, as many Authors fancy, and Patients 
that have got it otherwise, would, to pre- 
serve their Reputation, have to be so, some- 
what else being necessarily required to make 
the Seed degenerate into a Ferment that is 
Venereal, and altogether contrary to Na- 
ture; for the the Pox proving Infectious upon 
Copulation, is because its engender'd out of 
very infectious Diseases, aud conveyed by 
the Seed, which as it is the Spirits contract- 
ed, and Flower of all the Juices in the Body, 
so must it likewise consist of the Spirits con- 
tracted, and Flower of all the Infection, or 
infected Juices of the whole Body. But I 
shall not expatiate upon those Matters here, 
the narrow compass I am confin'd to prevent- 
ing; and besides, that I intend in my other 
Book, particularly to enlarge thereon. I shall 
therefore, as pertinent to the purpose afore- 
said, only relate the Cases of a Gentleman 
and his Wife lately under my Care, that were 
Venereal, (tho' they would have it that it 
was only from Weakness) and conclude this 
Head; which Cases will demonstrate how ea- 
sily ignorant Practitioners may be impos'd up- 
on in this respect, and what ways some Pa- 
|P_24
tients take, and Stories they invent to hide 
their Guilt, tho' manifestly to their own hurt: 
the Case is this. 

A Gentleman and his Wife, (who were 
but newly Marry'd,) came to me together, 
and told me a melancholly Story of a great 
weakness that attended them, contracted as 
he said by over-indulging themselves in their 
conjugal Enjoyments, and that it appeared 
upon them with a Running, Sharpness and 
stoppage of Urine, &c. In short, upon enqui- 
ry, I found they had nothing less than the ap- 
parent Symptoms of a Clap; they had been, 
as they told me, in the Hands of a Doctor, 
who for some time together had administred 
strengthning Medicines, but to so little pur- 
pose, that they grew worse, (as no wonder 
but they should) upon which he advis'd them 
to live abstemious, and hasten down to the 
Bath, which he said would Cure them; even 
the same, said I, as the old Womans Plaister 
did the Bone out of Joynt, which she said would 
draw it in again; however upon his meeting 
with my Book, they came as before-said to 
consult me, and I telling them they might 
be cured, gave them such encouragement, 
that put a stop to their Bath-journey, but 
finding his Wife Ignorant as to the real Cause 
of their Indispositions, and believing it to 
be his fault; I enquir'd not so strictly, nor 
told them what my Opinion was as to their 
Distemper, when they were with me together, 
lest it should stir up difference between them; 
but the next Day when he came for the Me- 
|P_25
dicines, I plainly told him their Cases were 
Venereal; but he (for fear, I suppose, that 
his Wife should know it) positively denied 
it, and seem'd displeas'd at me for telling 
him so, and said if it had been Venereal, his 
other Doctor would have discover'd it; but 
instead thereof, always assur'd them it was 
nothing but weakness. I told him his Doc- 
tor was certainly mistaken, and that I was 
sorry I had any Reason to tell him so; but 
if he himself was sure he never deserv'd for 
the Distemper, and also (as he said) could 
engage for his Wifes Honesty, he had better 
employ some Body else, for as 'twas my Opi- 
nion their Cases were Venereal, so I should 
not pretend to Cure them any otherwise 
than by Anti-Venereals, which if their Di- 
stempers were not so, would do them an In- 
jury; upon which, he reply'd, if they had 
the Distemper, it was gotten by only too 
violent Coition; but I telling him that could 
not be, he at last, upon engaging my Secre- 
sie, acknowledg'd the Matter, and told me, 
that a few Months before he was Married, he 
got a Clap, but thought that he had been as well 
from it, as ever he was in his Life, but now 
as it appear'd otherwise he begg'd Pardon for 
his denying it, and entreated my assistance, 
which I readily gave him, and with such 
Success that both of them were well Cured in 
a very short time; and to this Day his Wife 
knows no otherwise than that it proceeded, 
as at first represented; and there being no 
suspicion nor cause for it, they live very lov- 
|P_26
ingly together. This Gentleman, as an ac- 
knowledgement of my Care, over and above 
what I requir'd and was paid for their Cures, 
has since made me a very generous Present. 

I promis'd a little before to take further 
Notice about getting the Distemper by bare- 
ly lying in the same Bed with an Infected 
Person, and observ'd that I had never met 
with any that receiv'd the Taint that way; 
but at the same time it is to be understood 
that 'tis dangerous Sweating in a Bed with 
one that hath the Pox, so as to be wet with 
the Sweat, especially for young People, whose 
Constitutions are tender, Flesh more lax, and 
Pores more open, and readier to receive the 
Infection than those of Years, and such have 
been known to be infected thereby, witness 
the two Children infected by the Nursery- 
Maid, which I a little before Related; but 
yet it is not very commonly known; and to 
hear of grown People so infected, is very rare, 
especially robust, hardy Constitutions, who 
are scarce ever infected, tho' in the most 
Danger that way imaginable; an Instance of 
which was a Woman, whose Husband I had 
in Cure for the Pox, that lay with him con- 
tinually in the same Bed, wherein he was 
frequently Sweated, (they not having the 
conveniency of lying apart) and yet receiv'd 
not the least Injury, notwithstanding the dis- 
advantage she was under, of being very ill 
at the same time of another Distemper, and 
her Husband too in a most miserable Condi- 
tion, labouring under as radicated a Pox as 
most that I have known. 

|P_27
Also a late Patient I cured that had a thorow 
Pox upon him, with Breakings out in many pla- 
ces of his Body, who lay for many Weeks to- 
gether in the same Bed with his own Brother, 
a sound fresh-colour'd young Man, lately 
come out of the Country, not letting him 
know what ail'd him, tho' he frequently com- 
plain'd that he smell'd so strong, he could 
scarcely lye with him, yet never receiv'd the 
least Infection; notwithstanding he told me, 
(when he came to know what his Brothers 
Distemper was) that some Nights when he 
awak'd, he found himself to Sweat and stick 
to his Brothers Sores, and was in such fear 
concerning himself, that he could hardly be 
perswaded but that he had gotten the Infec- 
tion. Nay further than this, I have read 
that a certain noble Man of Padua, that had 
the Venereal Disease, for which he had used 
Guaiacum for Cure almost twenty times, and 
was thrice anointed with Quicksilver, yet the 
Distemper was so stubborn, as that he could 
not be cured; this Man, tho' infected, lay 
with several Virgins, and yet never gave to 
either of them the Disease. 

And Antonius Musa, relates one whose 
Wife had the Venereal Disease about her 
Breast, and tho' he continually lay with her, 
yet never contracted the Disease. The Cause 
of which must be, that the Disease had taken 
its seat in remote Parts and was not carried 
to the Genitals, else would certainly have 
proved Contagious, excepting for what we allow 
as to the disposition of some Bodies, as we shall 
|P_28
ticularly mention by and by, in which there 
is not an aptitude to receive it at all times, 
as we daily observe, by several Mens lying 
with one and the same infected Woman, 
and yet some of them shall be tainted, and 
others go free, as Gabriel Fallopius de Morbo 
Gallico cap. 22. makes mention; and that of 
12 Schollars that had to do at one time, with 
one and the same Whore, that had the Pox, 
one after another, only three of the twelve 
got the Infection, the rest escaped clear. 

And Eustachius Rudius writes, lib. 5. de Mor- 
bo occult. cap. 9. That he hath observed a 
thousand times, that many young Men have 
on the same day Copulated with one and the 
same Whore, and yet not all of them Infect- 
ed, and those that were infected, not infected 
alike. It appearing in one with a Running 
of the Reins, in another with a Bubo, in a- 
nother with Rottenness, another with Pain 
in the Head, another with falling off of the 
Hair, and in others with other different pre- 
ternatural effects; which doubtless, says he, 
happens by Reason of the various dispositi- 
ons of the Bodies, weakness of the Parts, and 
variety of the Humours; for Weak parts, do 
more easily receive Vitious Humours than 
the strong; and strong Bodies oftentimes re- 
sist Vitious Humours when weak ones can't; 
again one Body is more clean, another more 
foul, one abounds with one sort of Humours, 
another with others, which when they are 
corrupted with the Venereal or Poysonous 
Matter, do cause this, or that Symptom, 
|P_29
Secundum Corporis habitudo; by which is indi- 
cated both the Certainty, Degree and Nature 
of the Infection. 

An tho', as I have said before, that by 
the lascivious Kissings of impure or Infected 
Persons whose Lips are Ulcerated, or that 
have Ulcers in their Mouths or Throats, the 
Distemper is in like manner convey'd and at- 
tracted, yet it is not to be understood, that 
it can be gotten by the common modest way 
of Kissing, or being Kiss'd by such Persons; 
for were it so, what numbers of People would 
be daily infected with the Pox? and what 
Danger would Thousands be in of getting 
it, that never gave occasion for it? besides 
if the thing were possible, Kissing for that 
very reason would be soon out of use, many 
Women diseas'd being perhaps Kiss'd by 
twenty, when not lain with by one Man, 
and the same by a Man so Distemper'd; and 
after all, it is very rare that the Disease got- 
ten this way, should only seize the Throat 
without any other Symptom attending, tho' 
I have observ'd it so, yet more commonly 
with other Concomitants, but then perhaps 
more through neglect of taking it in time, 
or other Irregularities either in themselves, 
or ill management of the Practitioner, or both; 
it being very easie for the Patient, and too 
often for the Practicer, to be mistaken as to 
its Cause, and look upon it only as a Sore 
Throat from Cold, &c. which mistake proves 
too frequently to the Danger, if not De- 
struction, of the Patient; several such un- 
|P_30
happy People having come within my Know- 
ledge, that would scarcely be perswaded it 
could proceed from a Venereal Cause. 

It is likewise by some Authors mightily af- 
firm'd for Truth, that if a Woman that is 
perfectly Sound, should keep Company with 
half a dozen young Fellows as sound as her 
self, and be Debauch'd by them severally, 
time after time, some one or other of them 
shall quickly receive a Venereal Taint, and 
that 'tis rare but all of them, by a repetition 
of the Venereal Act, shall at last be infected, 
by the corrupt Ferment of mixt Seeds; but 
it is an assertion that I never could Credit, 
for were such a thing possible, as there has 
been Whores from the Creation that drove a 
common Trade, so we should consequently 
have had the Pox among us long before it 
had a beginning; it never, as the generality 
of Authors assure us, being known in any 
part of the World till the Year 1493. and 
that was at Naples, from Causes quite different 
to any thing of that kind; and besides by 
the many Enquiries I have made in my own 
Practice, and the opportunities had of inform- 
ing my self among others, and some of them 
the most curious, I could never find or hear 
of any one so infected. 

And the better to demonstrate the contra- 
ry, I will relate what I was told by a young 
Fellow who was the seventh that lay with a 
certain Servant-Maid that was clean, one af- 
ter another, as fast as they could, and yet 
neither of them, nor the Female as he posi- 
|P_31
tively assured me, got the least harm; and the 
more to convince me that what he said was 
true, he further declar'd, that they seven be- 
ing Intimates, and in League one with another, 
did frequently make use of her afterwards, for a 
considerable length of Time, and that it was 
rare but one, two, or three of them lay with her 
every Day, they allowing her a competency 
for the freedom, whereby she became a Pro- 
stitute to their Service, and no Bodies else; 
and indeed in my Opinion she needed no more. 

Thus plainly appears the unlikeliness, or 
rather impossibility of getting the Distemper 
that way, which the better to strengthen my 
Opinion, and confute those Practicers that 
believe the contrary, shall cursorily relate 
what a certain Author has observed concern- 
ing the like Matter. The Story is this. A 
Woman came on Board a Ship, of which he 
was the Surgeon, and was familiarly and fre- 
quently made use of for some Hours together 
by the greatest part of the Ship's Crew, they 
taking her by turns, and yet all of them 
came off clear without the least Venereal 
Taint, and positively affirms that the Wo- 
man was likewise the same. 

The same Author also gives an Account of 
another Woman that had been Drinking all 
Night, with some Officers belonging to a Gar- 
rison, with whom they had all the freedom 
of her Body they could desire, and she go- 
ing Home afterwards in a reeling Posture, 
was taken aside by some Soldiers, who made 
the like use of her, to the number of thirty 
|P_32
of them, one after another, yet notwith- 
standing all this mighty Heat of Action, nei- 
ther the Woman, nor the Men, upon the 
strictest Enquiry and Observation that could 
be made, received the least Hurt or Injury. 

These Instances one would think are suffi- 
cient to confute those that believe the Vene- 
real Ferment is produced by the Corruption 
of many Seeds, received into the Matrix of 
the same Woman, and not only do such Au- 
thors contend that it does, but also assert, 
that after those mixt Seeds have bred the Pox 
in her Womb, another fresh Man that is 
Sound conversing with her, shall carry off 
with his Yard that Venereal Ferment, and 
absolutely free the Woman from the same. 

'Tis from this, I suppose that the Liber- 
tines have a Notion, that when they have got 
the Distemper, their conversing with a Sound 
Person clears them from the Disease; as a 
young Fellow that I Cured of a Clap about 
12 Years ago, or more, who being sent in 
the time of his Cure by his Master, to carry 
some Goods to an Inn with a Country Girl, 
a Virgin, that had bought them of him, told 
me himself, that he prevail'd with her as they 
went along to go into a House to Drink with 
him, and afterwards to let him Debauch her, 
which he said he did, and for no other Rea- 
son, as he alledg'd, but because he had heard 
it would clear him of the Distemper; which 
yet was so far from having such an Effect, 
that it render'd his condition worse. 

|P_33
Neither is it possible (tho' many perswade 
themselves to the contrary) to get the Ve- 
nereal Distemper, by lying with a Woman 
when she has her Monthly Visits upon her, 
for were that likely, how many hundreds of 
Men should we have every Day infected? 
there being many that are of so hot and un- 
governable a Temper, as not to spare their 
Wives, even in that, the most forbidden 
Season, although they may have hear'd (it 
being what some Physicians and Mid-wives 
assert) that Children begotten at that Junc- 
ture, most commonly are Born either Weak- 
ly, or Distemper'd; and as some say (tho' 
without the least parity of Reason) Red- 
Hair'd. But at those times also, as well as at 
other Times and Seasons, even in the most 
Amorous Embrace, can it possibly procure 
to either of them the foul Disease, (pro- 
vided the Parties be sound) for the Reasons 
already alledg'd, however some others may be 
 of a contrary Opinion; an Instance of which 
was a Man that I not long since had in Cure 
for a Clap, who to excuse his Folly of Ramb- 
ling abroad, possest his Wife, and endeav- 
our'd also to amuse me, that he got it by con- 
versing with her at that Juncture, which the 
poor Credulous Woman believ'd, and had no- 
thing more to say, but that he might e'en thank 
himself, it being his own Fault, which was 
indeed too true, tho' she poor Woman at 
the same time was under a great mistake. 

But tho' neither of these last mention'd 
ways can produce that Disease, there is yet a 
|P_34
certain way of becoming infected, without 
Carnal Copulation, or attracting it by any 
external Means, and that is, by Heredita- 
ry Succession, the Parents Mass of Blood, 
and consequently Seed's being infected with 
the Venereal Taint at the time of the beget- 
ting the Birth, and being connatural with 
the Seminal and Sanguine Principles of the 
Body, makes the deepest Stain and Tincture, 
and is most difficult to be fetch out; many 
of which Born with the Disease upon them 
I have had in Cure, and which has prov'd 
very stubborn and obdurate, when arriv'd to 
the height of Infection; One that just now 
occurs to my Memory, among the many o- 
thers that I could recollect is as follows. 

A young Person born of impure Parents, whose 
Cure not being look'd after, or endeavour'd in 
its Minority, (tho' if it had, might very proba- 
bly have been difficultly cured) was, when grown 
up, so confirm'd, and the whole Mass of 
Blood and Juices so contaminated and spoil'd, 
that all the Efforts of Curing were but fruit- 
lesly attempted, insomuch that the Life it 
led, which was to 15 or 16 Years of Age, 
was a Life of Misery and Pain, it rotting 
away, as it were, by peace-meal; some part 
of the Nose, Cheek and Jaw, besides the Pa- 
late, &c. being consumed, before it approach- 
ed to the time of its deplorable Death: So 
that we may see, that the Hereditary Vene- 
real Disease is the worst to be endured, hardest 
to be cured, and is what generally proves the 
most fatal to the Patient, the malignant Ve- 
|P_35
nom being essentially implanted into the very 
nature of the Birth, and is very difficulty in 
all, if ever perfectly in any, eradicated and 
cured; and it's to be observ'd generally, that 
as such hereditary Poxes are harder of Cure, 
so the Infection in Children born with it, is 
the sooner and easier communicated to the 
Nurses that give them suck, and still the 
sooner convey'd to others that they converse 
with. 

I remember I have read somewhere of a 
Child that was born thus Diseases, that In- 
fected the Nurse that suckl'd it; she not 
knowing any thing of the Matter, infected 
her Husband and two Children more that she 
gave suck to; those Children were no soon- 
er taken home, but infected their Mothers, 
their Mothers their Husbands; and so in 
short no less than nine several Persons by 
means thereof, were infected in the space of 
one Month's time. 

But it may objected here by some, that 
notwithstanding the Parents may have the 
Disease upon them, yet Children have been 
begotten and Born sound and clear from any 
Infection or Symptoms thereof; which, may 
be true, as to outward appearance at least, 
yet as the Learned and most Ingenious Dr. 
Baynard says, the Infection has lain smother'd 
in their Bloods; and either such Children, 
when grown up have prov'd Sickly and Weak, 
or their Children been Rickety, King's-Evil'd, 
or Consumptive; for the Shakes and Girds strong 
Physick gives the human Fabrick, [which the 
|P_36
Parent under that circumstance must of Ne- 
cessity have taken,] cannot but loosen some 
Rivets and Pins, as I may say, that should go to 
the fastening of the Foundation of his Fami- 
ly. And quotes that true saying of Galen, lib: 
de sectis prope finem. 

Neque impune posse administrari remedia, cum 
omnia præter naturam sint, ob idque naturales fa- 
cultates infestent, nec possint adeo morbosas Cau- 
sas rescindere, quin una illis aliquid etiam benig- 
næ substantiæ rapiant. 

Which is in English viz.

Neither can those Remedies be administred 
without harm, seeing all things are preter- 
natural and for that Reason may infest the na- 
tural Faculties, nor can they so rescind or cut 
off the Morbifick Causes, but at the same 
time much snatch away or ravish along 
with them something of the benign or kind 
Substance. And this is that, says he, which 
causes no good Texture in our Off-Spring. 
Hence the complaints of Mala stamina Vitæ, 
when the Web and the Woof are not well 
struck together. 

How many Children, says he, have I heard 
(from their bitterness of Soul) Curse their 
Parents for begetting them, the wretched 
Heirs apparent to Pills, Potions, and Posset- 
drink, dwindling out the sputtering Snuff of 
Life, in Pain and Misery, and spending their 
little Substance among Physick-Harpies, and 
their ravenous Attendants, Nurses, Quacks, 
Apothecaries, &c. 

|P_37
Were I, says he, a young Woman, I think I 
shou'd very well be acquainted with my Man, 
and his Manners too, e'er I ventur'd on the 
Voyage-Life, in the Ship Matrimony; and 
é contrario, the Man sometimes has been 
Ship-Wreck'd on as Rotten a Bottom &c. for 
Non semper Inferius, sicut superius. 

One may look Brisk, with Cherry-Cheek, 
And yet below-Stairs very Weak. 
That Woman's in a doubtful Case 
That builds her hopes upon a Face; 
As One was cheated when she Chose 
A Husband by the length of's Nose. 
But I go on. 

There is yet another way of getting the 
Infection, without carnal Copulation, or by 
hereditary communication, and which has 
been but very little taken notice of by Au- 
thors, by some indeed judg'd unlikely; but 
the Account I am going to give will make the 
contrary manifest; the way I mean is by on- 
ly a superficial contact or meer touch with 
the Privities, the Man no more than placing 
the erected Yard to the Womans Labia, 
without the least entrance into her Body, 
which wanton and lustful Dalliance, have not- 
withstanding their imagin'd Safety, prov'd 
of bad presage to numbers; the Pocky Steams 
of the diseased Woman having by means 
thereof, as effectually imprinted their malig- 
nant Miasms on the Genitals of those Wary 
Gentlemen, as if they had pursued a close 
Engagement, some Instances of which I have 
|P_38
met with, and could divertingly enough relate; 
but they being too tedious to be particu- 
lariz'd in this place, shall only take notice 
of two or three which happen'd very lately, 
and reserve the remainder for the Treatise 
intended. 

An Apprentice that had the Venereal Di- 
stemper, importun'd the Servant-Maid in 
the House, (who was a Virgin) upon the 
promise of Marriage to let him lie with her, 
he assuring her that by what he had learnt 
by reading some Physick Books, he could so 
order the Matter as that it should be great 
pleasure to them both, and yet he would 
not get her with Child, (a great Belly being 
most she fear'd) to which at length she con- 
sented, not in the least imagining him to 
have the Distemper; but how far the 
Thuoghts of his Condition might restrain 
him from a close Engagement I know not, 
but when she came to me to be cured of a 
sore Throat, which she said she had gotten 
by Cold, observing her to be Hoarse, and 
finding upon Inspection there were foul Ul- 
cers upon the Uvula and Tonsils, I suspected 
her Condition, and charg'd her with having 
the Distemper, which, after some denial, she 
confess'd, and related the whole Story. But 
that which seem'd very much to please and 
comfort her under this melancholly Disaster, 
was, that she neither was with Child, nor 
so much as had parted with her Virginity, 
she declaring that he was so far from eject- 
ing any Seed into her Body, that he did 
|P_39
not enter her any farther than the Labia, 
which upon some Questions that I ask'd her, 
and further Assurances she gave me, I was 
almost ready to believe; but when I again 
consider'd the unlikeliness thereof, I could 
not but be of a contrary Mind, and con- 
cluded that he might either emit Seed in- 
to the Uterus and not get her with Child, 
or not emit into her, and so escape, notwith- 
standing by either of which means he might 
give her the Disease; but otherwise I 
cannot believe, nor that she retains her 
Virginity whatever she may fancy; for a 
small Running and heat of Urine she told 
me she had, and the Ulcers in her Throat 
as aforesaid were visible, so that she was 
both Poxt and Clapt together, and without 
doubt no Virgin. This Person I cured, and 
she remains now in as good a state of Health 
as any one can enjoy. 

Another that I think necessary to take 
notice of, was a Man that upon going to 
converse with a Woman, that he had pickt 
up in the Street, found her Body wet, and 
fearing the harm, retreated, after he had 
just toucht her with his Yard, and contented 
himself with the accommodation she was 
capable of affording him by her Hand, and 
dismiss'd her; the next Morning when he 
arose, he found a great pain in his Back, 
and soon after in his Yard, with a redness; 
upon which he applies to a Surgeon, who 
in the space of three Weeks or a Month 
left him as he found him, or rather worse: 
|P_40
He goes then to another Surgeon, who in 
about the same compass of time, afforded 
him likewise no Relief; and finding he could 
not cure him, told him at last he ail'd no- 
thing, and that he was sure there was no- 
thing in it, and that he had not the Distem- 
per; but meeting with my Book he comes 
from him to me: I told him by his Complaints 
he certainly was infected, and put him into a 
method of Cure; upon taking of the Medi- 
cines other Symptoms appear'd, which the 
more confirmed me that his condition was as 
I said, which to be sure it was, and of which 
in some time after I cured him, and he re- 
mains now as perfectly well as ever in his 
Life.
