[^Decorative frame around the letter "W", four lines in height.^]WHatever may be the Fate of 
this Account, I think my 
self indispensably obliged 
to relate the Facts that I saw, 
and transacted my self, as also the 
Reasons which first induced me to en-
quire into the Truth of such an Ex-
traordinary Event; but I here declare 
that I take on me no other Part of 
this Narration, than that in which I was 
actually concerned. 

As Mr. Howard himself intends 
shortly to publish the whole Account, 
and prove every Circumstance of 
|P_4
it, by such Evidences as will put 
this Matter out of all possibility of 
Doubt, I must refer to him for several 
Particulars here omitted. 

And as it will be impossible to judge 
impartially of this Fact, till the Evi-
dences abovemention'd are produced, 
it cannot be doubted but all such Per-
sons as are not governed by Prejudice, 
or some worse Motive, will suspend 
their Judgment till these Facts come to 
their Knowledge by a more certain 
way, than by flying Reports and Con-
jectures. 

The first Intelligence I received of 
this Matter, was on the 5th Instant, 
when I saw a very particular [/1./] Account 
of a Woman living at Godliman lately 
delivered of five Rabbets by Mr. John 
Howard, Surgeon at Guilford in Sur-
|P_5
rey, a Man of known Probity, Cha-
racter, and Capacity in his Profession, 
who has practis'd Midwifery for above 
these thirty Years. 

This Account was again confirmed 
by two [/2./] Letters from the said Mr. 
Howard, the fisst dated Nov. the 
6th, 4 a Clock in the Afternoon; the 
Substance of which is, That from the 
4th Instant to the 6th he had deli-
ver'd the Woman of three more Rab-
bets; that the last of them had leap'd 
in her Belly, for the space of eighteen 
Hours, before it dy'd, and that the 
Moment it was taken away, another 
was perceiv'd to struggle for Birth. 

The second is dated Nov. the ninth, 
and is here transcribed verbatim, viz. 

Sir, 

SINCE I wrote to you, I have ta-
ken or deliver'd the poor Wo-
|P_6
man of three more Rabbets, all three 
half grown, one of them a dunn Rab-
bet; the last leap'd twenty three Hours 
in the Uterus before it dy'd. As soon 
as the eleventh Rabbet was taken a-
way, up leap'd the twelfth Rabbet, 
which is now leaping. If you have 
any curious Person that is pleased to 
come Post, may see another leap in 
her Uterus, and shall take it from her 
if he pleases; which will be a great 
Satisfaction to the Curious: If she had 
been with Child, she has but ten Days 
more to go, so I do not know how 
many Rabbets may be behind; I have 
brought the Woman to Guilford for 
better Convenience. 

I am, Sir , 
Your humble Servant, 
John Howard. 

If you send a Person, let him 
bring a Letter from you.


|P_7
These Letters, with others to Persons 
of Distinction in Town, which all 
agree with the above-mentioned, 
were sufficient to make me desirous of 
being convinced personally of a Fact 
of which there was no Instance in Na-
ture. Accordingly on the 15th In-
stant, I attended the Honourable Mr. 
Molyneux, Secretary to his Royal 
Highness the Prince of Wales, who 
was inclin'd to enquire into the Truth 
of this extraordinary Case, and desir'd 
me to go with him to Guilford: We 
arrived there at about half an hour af-
ter two in the Afternoon. We sent 
to Mr. Howard, who came to us im-
mediately, and told us that the Wo-
man was actually in Labour of the 
fifteenth Rabbet. We had not been at 
his House long, before the Nurse who 
attends the Woman came to call Mr. 
Howard to her, she being then in one of 
her labour Pains. 

|P_8
She was lodged over against Mr. 
Howard's House, we found her dress'd 
in her Stays, sitting on the Bed-side 
with several Women near her. I im-
mediately examined her, and not find-
ing the Parts prepared for her Labour, 
I waited for the coming on of fresh 
Pains, which hapned in three or four 
minutes, at which time I deliver'd her 
of the entire Trunk, strip'd of its 
Skin, of a Rabbet of about four 
Months growth, in which the Heart 
and Lungs were contained with the 
Diaphragm entire. I instantly cut off 
a piece of them, and tried them in 
Water; they seemed but just specifically 
lighter than it, and Mr. Molyneuxpres-
sing them to the Bottom they rose a-
gain very slowly; the Heart was very 
large, and its Foramen Ovale entirely 
open; the Lungs were remarkably 
small, and of a much darker Colour 
|P_9
than commonly the Lungs are of such 
Rabbets, who have breathed for some 
time. No Person but my self touch'd 
her, from the first time that I had ex-
amined her, to the time of her being 
deliver'd by me: Her Pains were pret-
ty smart, and lasted for some Minutes; 
they went off the Moment she was de-
liver'd, and she seem'd chearful and 
easy; walked by herself from the Bed-
side to the Fire, and sat on a Chair, 
where I examined her; and found, that 
in the Course of the Fallopian Tubes, 
there were some Inequalities, but more 
sensibly on the right side of her Belly; 
which made me conjecture that the 
Rabbets were bred in those Tubes, 
and only came into the Uterus, when 
they gave her those Agitations, which, 
according to the account of Mr. How-
ard, and of several other Persons, 
|P_10
were sensibly felt many Hours before 
their Exclusion. 

As there was no Blood nor Water 
that issued from the Vagina, after I 
had delivered her, I again examined 
that Part, and found it not in the least 
inflamed or lacerated. 

Upon examining her Breasts, I found 
Milk in one of them, but only a lit-
tle yellowish Serum in the other. 

Her Pulse was regular, but some-
what low; her Tongue florid; and 
upon asking for her Water, those a-
bout her answered, she made very little, 
and that they had not saved any. 

She informed us, that in the Inter-
vals of her Labour-Pains she was to-
serably easy, and had no inclination 
for any sort of Food but Beef. 

About two Hours after we had left 
ɥer, they came again to call Mr. 
|P_11
Howard, she being at that Time in 
violent Labour-Pains; but he and 
my self were gone to see the Mayor, 
who was then ill. The Nurse that at-
tended her had delivered her, before 
our return, of the lower Part of a Male 
Rabbet, which we found totally with 
the Trunk, which I had before extract-
ed: This was also strip'd of its Skin, 
and compleatly perfect in all its Parts, 
but more manifestly so in those of 
Generation. 

In the Rectum of this Animal, which 
remain'd affix'd to the Body, we found 
five or six Pellets, much of the same 
Colour and Consistence as the com-
mon Dung of a Rabbet, little Bodies, 
like dried Fragments, being matted 
together with a mucous Matter. The 
like was observed in some other Parts 
of those Rabbets, which had come away 
before. In the other Bowels there was 
|P_12
a dirty colour'd Mucus, of the Na-
ture of that which is constantly found 
in the Bowels of all fœtus Animals, 
and which in those that void their 
Excrements in Pellets, is commonly 
hard and dry; but the Matter in the 
Guts of the first Animal was of an 
entire different Kind, Colour and Sub-
stance from any of the rest, this be-
ing like little Filaments of an Animal 
Substance. In the Middle of the Gut 
Ilium of this Creature, I found a ve-
ry slender, brittle, white Body, of the 
Length of half an Inch, which in Shape 
was like a very small Fish-bones. 

Between six and seven the same 
Evening we again visited her; we 
had not been there long, before she 
fell into violent Labour-Pains, inso-
much that four or five Persons cou'd 
hardly confine her to an Arm-Chair. 
As soon as the Violence of the first 
|P_13
Pain was somewhat abated, I examin-
ed her as before, and found the Va-
gina perfectly clear; and the Orifice of 
the Uterus so far closed, as not to ad-
mit of the little Finger. I constantly 
stood before her, nor did any Person 
whatsoever touch her, during that 
Time. After three or four very strong 
Pains, that lasted several Minutes, I 
delivered her of the Skin of the above-
said Rabbet, rolled and squeezed up 
like a Ball, without the least Moisture 
or Blood about it; upon which she re-
cover'd of her Pain. 

From that Time I did not stir from 
before her, nor did I withdraw my 
Hand, but to deliver the Skin to a 
stander by. 

About ten Minutes after, as near 
as I can judge, she again fell into La-
bour-Pains, though more sudden and 
short than the former; at which time 
|P_14
I again deliver'd her of the Head of 
the Rabbet, with the Furr on, part of 
one of the Ears being torn off, also 
without any Blood or Moisture: And 
as to these two Deliveries, and par-
ticularly as to the Circumstances of 
the latter, Mr. Molyneux having drawn 
up an Account of this whole Affair, for 
his own private Satisfaction; immedi-
ately upon our return to London; I beg 
leave to refer, for the Conviction he had 
of the Truth thereof, to that Account, 
which I have his leave to say, he will 
communicate to any Gentleman that 
is desirous to peruse it. 

After this she soon grew easy, and Mr. 
Howard gave her a sleeping Draught. 

About ten in the Evening we saw 
the Woman for the last Time, she 
being then in Bed: Having felt her 
Belly, I found it soft, except those 
Lumps, which still were in the same 
Place as before mentioned. 

|P_15
Between the Times of visiting the 
Woman, we examined the several 
Rabbets, which were all kept separate 
in distinct Pots, with Spirits of Wine, 
in the Order that they were brought 
away. 

The first Animal did not appear 
to be a perfect Rabbet, in all its Parts, 
three of the Feet being like the Paws 
of a Cat, the Stomach and Intestines 
like those Parts in the same Animal, 
as also the Shape and Figure of the 
Thorax; the Lungs and Heart of 
which were entirely out of their natu-
ral Situation, and squeezed out between 
the upper Ribbs and Vertebræ of the 
Neck, to which Parts they strongly 
grew and adhered. The Lungs of 
this Creature, had they been placed 
in their natural Cavity, would not 
have filled above a sixth Part of it: 
The Bones of this Creature being al-
|P_16
so different in Substance and Structure, 
from those of common Rabbets, the 
Head and one Paw only excepted. 

All the other thirteen Animals were, 
in every Particular, like well formed, 
common, natural Rabbets, from the Size 
of two Months Growth to four. They 
were all broken in Pieces, and much 
in the same Manner. I shall describe 
these pieces in the Order that Mr. 
Howard told us they had commonly 
been brought away. First the four Paws 
with the Furr on; then the Liver and 
Intestines; the Trunk and Shoulders in 
another Part: In three or four Animals 
the Loyns separated from the Os Sa-
crum; and in the rest, the Ischium
and Thighs in one piece, with the 
Loyns; the Head with its Furr, and 
lastly the Skin. 

When all these several Parts were 
put together in their proper Order, they 
|P_17
manifestly made up, and appeared to 
belong to the above-mentioned Ani-
mals: But the Viscera were wanting in 
four or five of them. One remark-
able Circumstance is, that most of 
these Animals were Females, as far as 
I could judge. 

The Heart and Liver of those 
which we examined, appeared much 
larger than usual, when compared 
with the Lungsand Intestnies which 
belonged to them; which on the con-
trary were extremely small. The Cœ-
cum and Colon, which are remarkably 
large in Rabbets, appeared not to ex-
ceed in bigness the other Intestines, and 
the spiral Structure of the Cœcum was 
not yet unfolded; the Stomach was in 
like manner much contracted, and its 
Pilorus very streigth and narrow. I 
cou'd not discover, in any of the Livers 
that I examin'd, the Ductus Venosus, 
|P_18
nor the implantation of the Umbelical
Vein in that Organ. 

I open'd three or four of the Hearts, 
and found in every one of them the 
Foramen Ovale, and the Ductus Arteri-
osus fully open, the two Trunks of the 
Descendant Cava united at the right 
Auricle of the Heart, agreeable to that 
Structure which is peculiar to natural 
Rabbets, and some few other Ani-
mals. 

The Flesh of these Creatures, par-
ticularly of that which I extracted, had 
the smell of Rabbets just killed: and 
the Substance of their Bones were, in 
all respects, like the Bones of the Fœtus
Rabbets; in several of them the Epi-
physes were separated from the Bones 
themselves. 

All the Heads which I examin'd 
had their compleat number of Teeth, 
four Cutters before, and ten Grinders 
|P_19
on each side, but they appeared not in 
the least worn nor stained, as the Teeth 
of other Rabbets are by Mastication. 

The Nails of the Paws were most 
of them exceedingly sharp. 

The Skins were all produced, being 
dress'd in Allum; they were of several 
Colours, as to their Furr, which was 
considerably long, and in one particu-
larly (which was the fifth Rabbet,) 
that part which cover'd the Head was 
curled. 

The Rabbet which I extracted 
weigh'd one and twenty ounces Aver-
dupoize, making an allowance for one 
of the Paws not yet come away, and 
part of the Viscera that were lost. 

From all these Considerations I was 
fully convinced, that at the same time 
that the external Appearance of these 
Animals was exactly like such Creatures, 
as must inevitably undergo the Chan-
|P_20
ges that happen to adult Animals, by 
Food and Air, they carry'd within 
them the strongest Marks of Fœtus’s, 
even by such parts as cannot exist in 
an Adult, and without which a Fœtus
cannot possibly be supposed to live. 
This, I think, proves in the strongest 
Terms possible that these Animals were 
of a particular kind, and not bred in 
a natural Way; nor will there be any 
doubt remaining (even with the least 
knowing in these matters) when those 
parts which are subservient to the Cir-
culation of the Blood, and Nourish-
ment between an adult Creature and 
its Fœtus are brought away; which I 
am fully satisfied must shortly happen, 
or, if retained, be the Cause of this 
Woman’s Death. 

All these Facts were verify'd before 
his Majesty, on Saturday Nov. the 26th, 
by the Anatomical Demonstration of 
|P_21
the first, the third, fifth, and ninth of 
these Animals, which were compared 
with the parts of two natural Rabbets, 
the one of the Age of four Months, 
and the other of five Days, Dr. Stei-
gerthal and Dr. Tessier being present. 

I shall with all convenient speed 
publish the Anatomy of these Præter-
natural Rabbets, with their Figures ta-
ken from the Life, and compared with 
the Parts of Rabbets of the same 
growth, that the differences before 
mention'd may be fully understood. 

In the mean while, I shall relate 
what appear'd in the Dissection of two 
Rabbets, which I performed in the 
Presence of Mr. Molyneux, the very 
Day that we returned from Guilford; 
the one was of four Months growth, 
and much of the Size of that which I 
had taken from the Woman, the other 
was barely fifteen Days old. The 
|P_22
Lungs of the larger were, as nearly 
as I can judge, twenty times bigger in 
Capacity than those of the præternatu-
ral one, and the Lungs of the smaller 
were at least eight times the bigness of 
the fore-mentioned; both these were 
exceedingly different, in Colour and 
Consistence, from those of the præ-
ternatural Rabbet. 

The Foramen Ovale of the smaller 
Rabbet was more than two thirds o-
pen, and that in the larger was so far 
closed, as but just to admit a very 
small Probe. 

As to the Stomach and Intestines, the 
difference was so notoriously great from 
those we had examined, that even in 
the sucking Rabbet, the Stomach and 
Cœcum were at least three times larger 
than those parts in the præternatural 
ones. 

I shall give no other Account of the 
|P_23
Woman, than what I think pertinent 
to this Subject: By the several Questi-
ons which I put to her, I was informed, 
that she was born and bred at Godly-
man; She seem'd to be of a healthy 
strong Constitution, of a small size, 
and fair Complexion; of a very stu-
pid and sullen Temper: She can nei-
ther write nor read: She has been mar-
ried about six Years to one Joshua Toft, 
Junior, a poor Journey-man Clothier 
at Godlyman, by whom she has had 
three Children. The account she fur-
thergave of herself, was, that on the 
23d of April last, as she was weeding 
in a Field, she saw a Rabbet spring 
up near her, after which she ran, with 
another Woman that was at work just 
by her; this set her a longing for Rab-
bets, being then, as she thought, five 
Weeks gone with Child; the other Wo-
man perceiving she was uneasy, charg-
|P_24
ed her with longing for the Rabbet 
they cou'd not catch, but she deny'd 
it: soon after another Rabbet sprung 
up near the same place, which she en-
deavour'd likewise to catch. The same 
Night she dreamt that she was in a 
Field with those two Rabbets in her 
Lap, and awaked with a sick Fit, which 
lasted till Morning; from that time, for 
above three Months, she had a con-
stant and strong desire to eat Rabbets, 
but being very poor and indigent cou'd 
not procure any. About seventeen 
Weeks after her longing, she was ta-
ken with a Flooding and violent Cho-
lick Pains, which made her to miscar-
ry of a Substance that she said was like 
a large lump of Flesh. Three Weeks 
after this, she was again taken with a 
Flooding, and voided another Sub-
stance like this former, but not so large. 
Notwithstanding these Accidents, she 
|P_25
did not perceive her self to grow less, 
but continued with the Symptoms of 
a breeding Woman; insomuch that in 
the beginning of September, as she was 
working in the Hop-Ground, the 
Milk flow'd profusely from her Breasts; 
and as she had Children before, she 
thought she felt very differently from 
what she used to do. That on the 
27th of September last she was taken 
very ill in the Night, and sent for her 
Mother in Law, who is a Midwife, 
and a neighbouring Woman, at which 
time she voided somewhat, which she 
took to be the Lights and Guts of a 
Pig, which her Husband carried to 
Mr. Howard, who some Days after-
wards came to her and deliver'd her 
of some parts of the Animal first men-
tion'd. After a Fortnight she was 
Churched, and thought all was over 
|P_26
with her. She told me that her Hus-
band had not cohabited with her, from 
the time of her first Miscarriage; and 
that after the first Rabbet was brought 
away, she had one regular Menstrual 
Evacuation. 

The Account Mr. Howard gave 
was, in every material Circumstance, 
the same with the Woman's Relation; 
he said the Guts and Liver (as he 
thought) of a Rabbet were brought 
to him, but he never knew or heard 
of the Woman or her Friends till 
then, and that at first he took this to 
be intended to be an Imposition upon 
him: but was at last with much Per-
suasion prevail'd on to go to assist her 
at Godlyman; that he did accordingly 
deliver her of part of the first Rabbet; 
that he attended her at Godlyman, 
till she was delivered of the ninth; 
|P_27
but that it being very inconvenient to 
attend her there, which made him 
neglect all his other Business, he had 
brought her to Guilford for better Con-
veniency. 

Mr. Howard further related, that 
when she was delivered of one Rab-
bet, another was immediately felt in 
her Belly, struggling with such Vio-
lence, that the Motion thereof cou'd 
be sensibly felt and seen: That this 
Motion has sometimes been so strong, 
as to move the Bed-Clothes, and that 
it has lasted for twenty and above 
thirty Hours together. This particu-
lar Fact was unanimously agreed on, 
and attested by most of the People 
at Guilford, who have had the Curio-
sity to go to see her, and was confirm-
ed to Mr. Molyneux and my self by 
above ten different Persons, who all 
|P_28
seemed to be indifferent in this Mat-
ter. 

Mr. Howard further told me, that, 
during this Motion, she was always 
free from Pain, and chearful; but 
that immediately upon the ceasing of 
it, she grew sick, and soon began to per-
ceive her Labour-Pains drawing near; 
that upon her first Pains, the Bones 
of the Animal were sensibly heard to 
snap, and break by the violent convul-
sive Motion of the Uterus: This last Cir-
cumstance was likewise related by the 
same Persons that attested the former. 
He further added, that she had four 
breakings of Waters in the coming of 
the Rabbets, although in no great 
Quantity. 

On Wednesday the 23d Instant, I 
set out again for Guilford, with Mr. 
D'Anteny, being resolved to bring the 
|P_29
Woman to Town, if there was any 
further prospect of more Rabbets. 
We arrived there at one in the After-
noon, and we found Mr. Howard
standing at his Door, who told us, that 
she had been delivered of two more 
Rabbets since I had seen her, and that 
he hoped all was over, being he did 
not perceive in the Uterus any Motion 
as usual. I visited her several times 
that Day, and proceeded in every re-
spect as before; her Pains, which, 
when I saw her the first Time, were 
mixed with intervals of Quiet and Rest, 
now were constant and fixed on the right 
Side of her Belly; her Pulse was more 
irregular; she described her Pain as if 
very coarse brown Paper was tearing 
from within her. Towards eight a Clock 
that Evening she voided a Piece of 
one of the Membranes of a Placenta, 
|P_30
rolled up like Parchment; when it 
was extended, it measured about six 
Inches over. The next Morning, as 
I was packing up of some of the Rab-
bets to bring to Town with me, Mr. 
Howard was sent for over, and Mr. 
D'Anteny, Dr. Hempe, and my self 
attended him. We found her in ex-
quisite Torture, and after seven or 
eight Minutes, she was again disbur-
then'd of a Membrane, in Structure, 
Shape and Size exactly like the for-
mer. This was the first part that I saw 
come from her with some effusion of 
Blood. She did not seem in the least 
reliev'd after this Operation, her Pulse 
continu'd irregular, her Tongue white, 
and her Urine deeply stained with a 
Mucus: and livid Blood. 

|P_31
Mr. Ahlers having been at Guil-
ford, by his Majesty's Order, (as Mr. 
Howard told us) to enquire into the 
Truth of this Fact, was fully con-
vinced of it, as he himself declared, ha-
ving assisted the greatest part of Sun-
day the 20th instant, at the Delivery 
of some of the 16th Rabbet, which 
he brought to Town with him. But 
as on this Occasion his Behaviour has 
been represented here different from 
what it was at Guilford, I cannot bet-
ter vindicate that Gentleman's Cha-
racter, than by subjoyning the fol-
lowing Affidavits, which were ta-
ken in the presence of Mr. D'An-
teny, and Doctor Hampe. And that 
the Truth, so far as it relates 
to this Point, may be known, 
I think he is strictly obliged, in 
|P_32
Justice to the Publick, forthwith to 
give an Account of what he saw and 
transacted there; as I here have done. 

London, Monday
Nov. 28. 1726. 

N. St. Andrè. 

I HAVE carefully read the above Narrative. 
Whether the Animals mentioned therein were 
præternaturally produced in this Woman, or that 
a Fraud is practicable in this Case, I do not take 
upon me to say: Gentlemen who are sufficient Judges 
will determine that Matter upon proper Evidence; I 
can only certify, That I did draw up a Relation as 
is above-mentioned, which, in the most material Cir-
cumstances of Fact, agrees with this Narrative 
and I can further affirm, that I did not perceive 
the least Circumstance of Fraud in the Conduct of 
this Affair while I was at Guilford. 

Nov. 29. 1726. 

S. Molyneux. 

|P_33
JOhn Howard of Guilford in the [/3./]
County of Surrey Surgeon, ma-
keth Oath, That on Sunday the twen-
tieth Day of this instant Month of 
November, at or about ten a Clock 
in the Morning, he this Deponent 
was called home to a Person who 
told him his name was Ahlers; that 
he was come to see Mary Toft; 
that he was ordered by his Majesty 
to attend her till all was over; and 
that he was Surgeon to his Majesty's 
German Houshold. And this De-
ponent saith, That at that very time 
the Nurse of the said Mary Toft
came to acquaint this Deponent, 
that the said Mary Toft was in La-
bour: And thereupon this Depo-
nent carried the said Mr. Ahlers
over to her with him, and having 
touched her in his Presence, desired 
him to examine her, for that he found 
all things ready for a Delivery. 
|P_34
That Mr. Ahlers did accordingly 
examine; but this Deponent finding 
that he did not hasten her Delivery, 
nor that he proceeded as one who 
understands Midwifery should do, 
this Deponent directed him how to 
proceed in the Extraction, which 
after some time Mr. Ahlerseffect-
ed, having brought away the Loins 
and inferior Parts of a Rabbet, of 
about three Months Growth. That 
after this Mr. Ahlers told this De-
ponent, and all the Persons present, 
that he was fully satisfied, and con-
vinced of the Truth, and that he 
could have no Doubts after such 
Proofs. That at the same time he 
gave the Woman a Guinea, expres-
sing great Satisfaction, and promising 
that he would procure her a Pen-
sion from his Majesty: That he re-
peated the same Things to Mr. Tho 
Howard in this Deponent's Presence 
|P_35
nor did he offer any Objections or 
Doubts to them. That some time 
after Mr. Ahlers desired to touch the 
Woman again; but as at the time 
before he had put her to a great 
deal of unnecessary Pain, this De-
ponent desired him to forbear. That 
some time after Mr. Ahlers said he 
was not well, and that he must 
hasten back to London. That this 
Deponent pressed him to stay, that 
he might assist at the bringing away 
of the Remainder of the Rabbet, but 
could not prevail on him; and soon 
after he accordingly set out for 
London, although it was almost 
dark.
