[}TO THE 
ROYAL SOCIETY. }]Honoured Sirs! 

IN the following pages are 
contained some reasons 
why the contagious poison 
of the Small-pox, received 
into the human body, can-
not be extinguished, or ex-
pelled by any Antidote, or 
other means than what nature 
effects in producing the dis-
temper. I have also endea-
voured to explain the man-
|P_vi
ner of the propagation and 
eruption of the Small-pox
from the practice of inocula-
tion; and why this distem-
per, taken, by common in-
fection, in the natural way, 
proves so much more fatal 
than that which is given by 
inoculation.

The reasons that have in-
duced me to present you 
with this short account from 
the press, were by no means 
owing to a consciousness of 
my having cleared up these 
matters to any degree of 
|P_vii
certainty; but because I do 
not remember to have seen 
any thing of this kind at-
tempted before; and in 
hopes that my endeavours 
may be the means of em-
ploying the thoughts of o-
thers to explain these laws of 
Nature to a greater degree 
of perfection. 

These inducements have 
encouraged me in this Ad-
dress to your learned Socie-
ty; to which the World 
will ever be indebted for the 
improvement of Art and Sci-
|P_viii
ence; and I hope they may 
be admitted, as a necessary 
apology, for this presump-
tion. 

I am, 
Honoured Sirs, 
Your most respectful, 
and
Most obedient Servant, 
Thomas Frewen. 

|P_
[}Some reasons why the Contagion of 
the Small-Pox, received into the 
human body, cannot be extin-
guished or expelled by any Anti-
dote, or other means than what 
Nature effects in producing the 
distemper. }]
THAT most celebrated Pro-
fessor, the learned Dr. Boer-
haave, was of opinion that there 
is to be found out, in Nature, such 
a kind of medicine as would have 
the specific power of extinguishing, 
or eradicating the Contagion of 
the Small-pox, from a body infect-
ed, without permitting any erup-
tion of the pustules; in the man-
ner that other poisons are cured by 
|P_2
peculiar Antidotes[/1./]. Some other 
Physicians, also, revering the sen-
timent of this great man, have 
pretended to support the same opi-
nion. 

But, as no improvements have 
yet appeared to have been made, 
at least nothing material has been 
advanced, by the advocates for 
this enquiry, notwithstanding the 
Doctor gave his reasons for his opi-
nion, and explained his suggestions 
as far as he could, it is probable, 
therefore, that the unsurmountable 
obstacles which have arisen from 
the consideration of this contagious 
venom, and the different manner 
of it's operations, have, hitherto, 
discouraged all the attempts that 
may have been since made towards 
|P_3
the discovery. And, indeed, I am 
inclined to think, that, had the 
Doctor written on this particular 
subject, after the practice of inocu-
lation grew to be so much used in 
Europe, as it now is, he would, from 
the new discovery of the operation 
of this morbific taint, have esta-
blished opposite reasons to an opi-
nion, which, many years ago, he 
thought uncontrovertable. For so 
conspicuous in experiment, as this 
is, could never have escaped his 
sagacious observation; which proves 
that the least particle of variolous 
pus, containing the very seeds of 
contagion, by enflaming and cor-
roding an external solid part, pro-
ducetha kind of Carbuncle;where-
by the natural operation of this 
contagious infection is demonstrated 
to the greatest degree of certainty, 
|P_4
and silences all hypothetical notions 
of its contaminating the fluids only, 
by explaining (as I shall endeavour 
to do more hereafter) that the mor-
bific effluvia of this disease received 
by inspiration, in the ordinary way of 
infection, by inflaming and cor-
roding, in like manner, such in-
ternal parts as are more immediate-
ly subservient to the vital purposes, 
are therefore more likely to be pro-
ductive of the most dangerous con-
sequences. 

The method, however, given,
for attaining to the knowledge of 
this discovery, is, after the infection 
of the Small-pox is taken, to pre-
vent inflammation, so that a suppu-
rated matter may not ensue: and 
this is proposed to be effected, by 
treating the distemper, like other 
inflammatory cases, in the begin-
|P_5
ning; and giving such correcting 
medicines, as, by gently diluting 
and dissolving the blood, may car-
ry off the cause by the convenient 
outlets; and so cure the disease, 
while in it's first state, without coming to suppuration. 

For this purpose the Doctor 
mentions a preparation of Mercury
and Antimony, brought to a great 
degree of penetrability, and ren-
dered intirely destitute of all Acri-
mony by dissolution, &c; from 
whence, he says, there ariseth almost
such a kind of medicine, and by 
which he hath seen some good ef-
fects. 

The Aethiops Mineralis hath 
been likewise proposed as a specific 
medicine, for the same intention, 
by Dr. Lobb, who hath given 
some instances of the Small-pox being, 
|P_6
in his judgment, prevented by the 
timely use of it. But as there 
have been frequent examples of 
people escaping this distemper, who 
had been supposed to be in the 
greatest danger of taking it; it is 
not improbable but that some of 
these may have been attributed, 
by mistake, to such preventive 
means as had been used on those 
occasions. 

Dr. Cheyne also hath pronounc-
ed that the best Antidote in nature 
against the Small-pox, and the 
Plague itself, is Aethiops Mineralis
and Cinnabaris Antimonii, taken, 
made up into boluses, twice or 
three times a day, and washed down 
with Orange Whey. Of the ef-
ficacy of which, he says, he has 
had some successful experience. 
For the confluent Small-pox, he 
|P_7
adds, is but a miniature of the 
Plague, and both are curable in 
good habits. 

Many more writers (some of 
which are of great eminence) have 
touched also upon this matter, as 
the sentiment of Boerhaave, but 
without presuming any further; 
well knowing that an affair of this 
nature can admit of no alternative, 
and that it is to no manner of pur-
pose to pretend to defend by argu-
ment what cannot be sufficiently 
warranted by experience. For such 
particularities in opinion have been 
oftentimes ridiculed, in men of 
learning, as the effects of mere 
whim and chimera. 

But the character of Boerhaave
is too sacred for reflection, as he 
certainly had no design to impose 
on the judgment of others by a 
|P_8
prediction of this sort, which was 
grounded, probably, on such Spe-
culations in Chemistry as are not 
easily to be explained on mecha-
nical principles.

Dr. Mead[/2./], however, could 
not pass over this opinion of his 
learned friend without wondering 
how he could be induced to hope 
that some time or other a specific 
Antidote would be found against the 
contagious poison of the Small-pox;
that is, by which it would be so tho-
roughly destroyed, that, tho'it had 
been received into the body, it 
could not produce the disease. 
For, continues he, the elements of 
things are so certain, and so well 
established by the permanent laws 
of Nature; that whosoever would 
endeavour to change them, would 
|P_9
act like those Philosophers by fire
(as they stile themselves) who labour 
hard to transmute the baser metals 
into gold; and when continual 
disappointments have convinced 
them of the vanity of their hopes, 
actually extract gold out of the 
purses of the ignorant and credu-
lous by the fumes of their char-
coal[/3./]. 

In an affair of this kind, it is 
undoubtedly the safest and truest 
way to consult nature herself, as a 
divine principle, diffused through-
out the creation, acting in all bodies 
by certain properties which are pro-
ductive of certain effects. And 
we may consider her in a vast vari-
ety of senses, as she doth nothing 
in vain; attempts always to pre-
|P_10
serve herself; cures all diseases; 
and acts upon unerring rules in all 
her ways. Hence we observe in 
Fevers, particularly those of the 
eruptive kinds, the most surprising 
commotions and conflicts, which 
serve to throw off the morbific mat-
ter by various ways, for the relief 
of the Patient; and, in these 
cases, especially, she is to be nicely 
observed, and followed with the 
greatest care; because any counter-
acting means would obstruct her first 
design, and make her proceed upon 
other different principles, which 
would consequently beattended with 
very different effects. 

It ought to be considered, there-
fore, whether a specific antidote
against the contagious taint of the 
Small-pox (if such an one were dis-
coverable) would not be likely 
|P_11
to do more hurt than good, by 
preventing a distemper, which, 
perhaps, was intended by nature, 
as Dr. Gilchrist observes, for a 
drain to clear the constitution of 
some gross humours, which, if not 
carried off in this way, would bring 
on other diseases. The same Gen-
tleman supports this opinion by ob-
serving that those Children who had 
had the Small-pox by inoculation in 
Scotland were uncommonly 
healthy; which he supposes to be 
owing to this cause, that the Fever 
in the Small-pox, communicated 
in the infant state, not only destroys 
or expells the latent seeds of dis-
eases, before they are, by time and 
accidents, perfected, and put into 
action; but causes such an altera-
tion of the humours as may make 
them less susceptible of any morbid 
|P_12
impressions: And the vessels being 
so accustomed, before they become 
rigid, to certain motions and ex-
tensions, the body is rendered, ever 
after, more passive to the impul-
ses of any subsequent distemper. 
This, he maintains, is agreeable 
to experience; for one who has 
suffered an acute illness will bear 
sickness better than another, who 
never had the like distemper, and 
be less overcome by it[/4./]. 

Hippocrates calls nature the great 
physican; and our judicious Sy-
denham says, that a disease is nothing 
more than an effort of nature to 
throw off the morbific matter for 
the health of the patient; which 
Dr. Mead has observed to be no 
|P_13
where more particularly verified 
than in those envenomed Fevers, 
in which the violence of the dis-
temper breaks out on the Skin ei-
ther in the form of pustules, car-
buncles, or bubos. And hence 
it seems pretty plain that no art can 
abrogate the law of nature, by the 
prevention of those kind of dis-
eases which happen from contagion. 

Those corpuscular effluvia of the 
Small-pox, or particles which fly 
off from distempered bodies, and, 
mixing with the juices of others, 
occasion the same disease, are pro-
duced from a matter differing from 
all other poisons, and liable to 
cause inflammation in a greater or 
lesser degree, according to the con-
stitutional state and condition of 
those that receive them: and some 
miserable cases of the Small-pox
|P_14
have shewed us instances where 
the whole texture of the blood has 
been so broken and dissolved, that 
the crassamentum, after it had stood 
a while to become cold, could but 
just hold together. Yet, notwith-
standing, there have been some 
instances where this poison hath 
given so little disturbance, as 
scarcely to introduce any perceiv-
able lentor on the blood, at least not 
enough to obstruct it in the capil-
lary Vessels: And we have several 
times remarked where it has been ap-
plied by inoculation, that if it had not 
been for it's immediate action on a 
solid part, it would have proved 
insufficient even to show the cha-
racteristick marks of the Small-pox.

Therefore it is not altogether 
improbable but that this contagious 
venom may operate by various 
|P_15
ways; sometimes by coagulating 
the blood; at others by dissolving 
it; and sometimes by corroding 
the solid parts themselves: And 
this may be owing, perhaps, to 
such natural causes as are not with-
in the reach of human penetration. 
Which considerations, notwith-
standing the deference I pay to Dr. 
Boerhaave's extraordinary merit and 
abilities, have induced me to ques-
tion, even, the bare possibility of 
such a discovery. But, to go on. 

The Doctor intimates that the 
bite of the Scorpion, which was 
formerly supposed to be certain 
death, is now cured by the appli-
cation of the bruised Scorpion, or 
the oil of it, and concludes that all 
poisons have their antidotes; and, 
therefore, why may not a specific 
medicine be found out of such a 
|P_16
nature, that, being diffused all the 
body over, after the variolous in-
fection is received, may introduce 
contrary properties, and thereby 
extinguish the distemper in the be-
ginning, before those effects are 
produced which must, otherwise, 
necessarily follow? For what Phy-
sician, says he, in a Pleurisy, 
Quinsy, &c. would wait for a cure 
by suppuration, when daily experi-
ence convinces us that these distem-
pers are regularly cured without it? 
and why may not the inflammation 
be carried off, as well, in the first 
stage of the Small-pox, as in other 
inflammatory diseases, and so pre-
vent its coming to suppuration at 
all? 

To this, it may be said, that the 
general method of cure in Pleu-
risies, Quinsies, and other inflam-
|P_17
matory distempers, which are nei-
ther contagious, nor of the erup-
tive kinds, proves insufficient to 
prevent the return of them, as 
often as the sudden changes and al-
terations of the weather, different 
seasons of the year, and many 
other accidental causes may happen 
to produce them. But, it is not 
so, in regard to the Small-pox; a 
disease which is propagated by it's 
own contagion only, without any 
other antecedent cause; and where 
a determinate length of time brings 
on every thing according to it's 
stated periods; so that nature, in 
doing her part, is a most certain 
guide to the Physician for the do-
ing of his. Besides it is evident 
that the venom of this distemper 
can infect us but once; insomuch 
that that pabulum in our bodies, 
|P_18
which is productive of this disease, 
being totally taken up by the con-
tagion it hath received, is thereby 
expunged and eradicated, so that 
there remains nothing, afterwards, 
on which this morbific matter can 
have any further effect. And, 
indeed, in this sense, it may be 
truly said that the Small-pox is it's 
own antidote, by protecting all that 
undergo it from any future attack. 

It may be granted how extream-
ly difficult it is to clear the mass 
of blood of this poison; yet it is 
most certainly true that Nature en-
deavours, with all her might, at 
the expulsion of it in the most 
perfect manner; that is, by forcing 
the morbid matter, as much as 
possible, to the pustules[/5./]: And 
|P_19
any interruption must prove of 
dangerous consequence, lest the 
humours should be impeded in their 
circulatory motion, and fall into 
an intestine one, and grow putrid; 
which is frequently the case after 
too large evacuations, or excessive 
heat; where there is such a scarcity 
of spirits, that the solids do not 
vibrate sufficiently to keep the fluids 
in their due velocity. 

This plainly indicates the hurt-
fulness of too great evacuations in 
the beginning of the Small-pox;
and shews the Physician's part to be 
only to assist, by following nature; 
and not going before her. 

The Measles are an inflamma-
tory fever of the eruptive kind; 
whose pustules never arrive to a 
purulent state like those of the 
Small-pox; and they are cured by 
|P_20
bleeding, and cooling medicines: 
but, I believe, it was never yet 
seen that these remedies could pre-
vent their eruption, tho' made use 
of ever so soon after taking in the 
infection.

There have been some instances 
in the Small-pox, where spontane-
ous hemorrhages, or other repeated 
bleedings have seemed to alter the 
nature of the distemper in some 
degree, by making that prove kind-
ly, which would, probably, have 
fallen out otherwise, for want of 
those evacuations; but, I am per-
suaded, there never was any one 
proof of the contagion being wholly 
carried off that way, without some 
eruption of the pustules: so that 
it seems evident, even to a demon-
stration, that Nature, after a re-
moval of the load that oppresses 
|P_21
her, must be left to do her part in 
her own way, by causing sup-
puration, in a greater or lesser 
degree, as there happens to be oc-
casion for it; in order to free the 
body from the corrupted state of 
the blood and humours arising from 
the contagious taint of this disease. 

Moreover it is certain that the 
whole animal body, at all times 
before it has passed through the 
Small-pox, is, in every part alike, 
liable to receive the morbose, or 
infecting taint, and so propagate 
the disease. We know, also, that 
the least particle of the morbific mat-
ter, applied to any part of the 
body, will cause the Small-pox to 
be produced as effectively as a much 
greater quantity could be capable 
of doing it. And it is evident, 
from common experience, that all 
|P_22
mankind, as well those who come 
of parents that have had the Small-
pox, as those that have not, are 
alike liable to it; so that we may 
conclude the pabulum of this dis-
temper to be a part of the human 
nature, conceived in the first rudi-
ments of generation; and therefore 
not to be extinguished by any art, 
or other means, than it's own na-
tural destroyer, the Small-pox
itself; which only can render the 
body more perfect, by eradicating 
this one natural principle of morta-
lity, and thereby giving it a secu-
rity, for ever, against any further 
attack from this great evil. 

The contagion of the Small-pox
previously considered in a pestilen-
tial sense, the true manner of it's 
operation on human bodies, as it 
may be best known from the expe-
|P_23
riment of inoculation, seems suf-
ficient to furnish more matter for 
the Physician and Philosopher than 
could possibly have been advanced 
without it. Insomuch that the 
discovery of a specific medicine to 
prevent the burning of a Caustic,
or even Fire itself, may as well be 
expected, as to destroy the power 
of variolous contagion, when taken 
either in the natural way, or appli-
ed by inoculation. Most certain, 
therefore, it is, that no discovery 
of this kind, so seemingly repug-
nant to the laws of Nature, can 
ever be ascribed to human inven-
tion. 

|P_24
[}An attempt to explain the manner 
of the propagation and eruption 
of the Small-pox, from the practice 
of inoculation: And why this di-
stemper, taken by common in-
fection, in the natural way, proves 
so much more fatal than that which 
is given by inoculation. }]
THE main business of natu-
ral Philosophy, as Sir Isaac 
Newton observes, is to argue from 
Phenomena, without feigning Hy-
potheses, and to deduce causes from 
effects till we come to the very first 
cause. Therefore it ought to be 
the study of Physicians to consider 
well the various and subtile me-
thods which Nature useth in pro-
ducing diseases; and this can be 
known in general only by the dif-
|P_25
ferent symptoms that occur to indi-
viduals in all cases. For her pro-
gress is undoubtedly slower or fas-
ter according to the different me-
thods she takes in expelling the 
morbific cause, so that the morbid 
particles, being separated by her 
own action, may be discharged in 
her own way. 

When a body, therefore, be-
comes contaminated by a contagious 
taint, it may be of the greatest use 
to know by what means it so hap-
pened; as the mode of nature, 
in her method of extricating the 
morbific matter, differs, probably, 
in great measure according to the 
different manner of receiving it: 
insomuch that the danger or safety 
of the patient may depend greatly 
on the primary communication of 
this matter either to an external or 
|P_26
an internal part. And this opi-
nion hath been confirmed by many 
observations of the Small-poxpro-
duced by inoculation, where the 
distemper hath been remarkably 
great from a multitude of the pus-
tules, as well as the condition of 
them; which have gone off, by 
that preventive means, without any 
great uneasiness; whereas the same, 
in the natural way, are usually at-
tended with a very high Fever, 
Delirium, and other dangerous 
contingencies, owing probably to 
imperceptible effluvia conveyed, at 
first, to the Lungs, Heart, Brain,
&c. 

But for a further explanation of 
this matter, by an enquiry into the 
different methods that nature pur-
sues in communicating the Small-
pox both by common infection, and 
|P_27
the artificial experiment of inocu-
lation, we shall the better form a 
judgment, agreeable to her own 
elements and principles, by her 
own rules and indications. And, 
in order thereto, it is manifestly 
certain, that, the air being infected 
with the venom of this distemper, 
the morbific particles, contained 
therein, are received into the hu-
man body by inspiration; and they 
act, wherever they happen to fall, 
by an irresistable power, like fire 
unextinguishable, until they have 
utterly subdued that pabulum in 
the body which was susceptible of 
this contaminating taint, and so 
propagated the disease: for thus it 
is we are secured from having the 
Small-pox a second time. But the 
causes of it's destructive malignity 
may be more than the nicest ob-
|P_28
servation can discover. And, in-
deed, the mode of Nature, from 
this theory alone, seems to be too 
intricate and perplexing for human 
understanding; insomuch that the 
nature of the morbific matter, from 
whatever different kind of the Small-
pox it may happen to come, is cer-
tainly the same, and plainly makes 
no difference in the nature of the 
disease. The difference of consti-
tutions, therefore, it may reason-
ably be supposed, is the principal 
cause of the different kinds of the 
Small-pox. And, these principles 
being generally admitted, I think 
it evident, therefore, as far as it can 
be demonstrated from experience, 
that a different manner in giving 
the infection (I mean that of ino-
culation) manifestly produceth a 
different effect. And this, I make 
|P_29
not the least doubt, would unex-
ceptionably appear upon the trial, 
if it was possible to meet with two 
persons of exactly the same age and 
constitution, by communicating, 
to each of them, the same conta-
gious taint, by the different ways 
of infection. But, for want of 
this, let us examine further, by 
pursuing the mode of nature, also, 
under the experiment of inocula-
tion, and see what new discovery 
will arise to give an additional light 
to this matter. 

By this method of trial it is evi-
dent that the smallest portion of 
the variolous pus, applied, by a 
slight incision, to any part of the 
body, acts in the manner of a 
caustic, by inflaming and corroding 
the part; insomuch that the conti-
nuity, after some days, is destroy-
|P_30
ed; and an ulceration caused from 
the separation of the eschar: And 
the taint of this infection, being 
infused into the blood, is convey-
ed, by means of the circulation, 
throughout the whole animal body; 
and touching every where on it's 
proper pabulum, like a spark of 
fire among particles of Sulphur,
or Nitre, in a certain length of 
time it doth it's office, by exciting 
feverish symptoms, which regularly 
go off in a diaphoresis; whereby 
the salt serum of the blood, so 
impregnated, is driven out by the 
glands of the skin; and then the 
pores, being properly enlarged, 
let out the fiery pustules on the 
surface; which seems to be the 
true manner of the propagation and 
eruption of the Small-pox.

|P_31
From this experiment we may 
reasonably suppose that the morbi-
fic effluvia of this distemper, re-
ceived by inspiration also, produce 
the same kind of phenomenon in the 
natural way; and that these veno-
mous particles, happening to fall 
on the vital parts, by inflaming and 
corroding the same, in like man-
ner, are so commonly attended with 
their fatal effects; for instance, on 
the Lungs, Brain, &c.; where it 
is impossible for nature to help her-
self, or be furnished with any assis-
tance to her relief. And this may 
occasion, which we daily see, high 
fevers, delirium, shortness of breath, 
the most surprising struggles and 
conflicts, and sudden changes in the 
Small-pox.

It may be supposed, also, that 
an infinite number of the virose 
|P_32
particles, contained in the infected 
air, may be drawn in by the breath 
and nostrils at the same time; and 
so conveyed by the divarication of 
the Trachaea to the Lungs; and 
also by the olfactory nerves, or 
their fibrillæ, to the most delicate 
texture of the brain, whereby a 
multitude of different parts may 
receive the contagious effect at the 
same instant of time; which, by 
pervading the innermost recesses of 
the whole animal compages, may so 
break and destroy the continuity of 
parts of moment, as to render a 
dissolution of the whole frame un-
avoidable. And that particular spe-
cies of the Small-pox, in which the 
texture of the blood is so absolutely 
broken, that it dischargeth itself 
by every outlet of the body; and, 
stagnating in the small cuticular 
|P_33
vessels, produceth black, gangren-
ous spots, all the surface over, is 
but too melancholy a proof of the 
truth of this hypothesis, from the 
sudden and untimely destruction that 
it usually brings upon the patient. 

Inoculation explains also the rea-
sonableness of this opinion: for if 
the morbific matter be applied to 
ever so many place, it will have 
the same effect in every one; by 
occasioning so many corroding Car-
buncles, if they may be so called; 
which, the more they are, the more 
likely they will be to increase the 
###Greek omitted###, or the contagious infection 
of the blood and spirits: and, for 
this reason, I have wholly given up 
an opinion I had espoused some 
years ago; from a supposition that 
discharges from more inoculated 
places than one would be of advan-
|P_34
tage to the patient, by carrying off 
a greater quantity of the humours 
of the body, by means of those 
drains; and so, consequently, would 
be likely to prevent such feverish 
disorders and complaints, as might, 
otherwise, arise in the course of the 
Small-pox. But experience hath 
plainly shown this kind of doctrine 
to be erroneous; and convinced 
me, that the application of the vi-
rose matter, to one part only, is 
much safest and best; and, indeed, 
the corrosion of any one part, caused 
by the application of variolous mat-
ter, is a sufficient proof of its tak-
ing effect, and doing all that this 
contagion can do; even tho' there 
may happen to be scarce any febril 
symptoms produced from it, or so 
much as a perfectly distinguished 
pustule of the Small-pox: for the 
|P_35
ulcerated part being cicatrised, will 
remain, beyond all dispute, as cer-
tain a mark of security to the pa-
tient, as if the skin had received 
the impressions of having under-
gone this distemper in ever so great 
a degree. And truly, if it were 
not so, several persons, under my own 
care, who had no pustulary erup-
tions, must have taken the Small-
pox, from those who were their 
companions and bed-fellows in the 
distemper, by the ordinary way of 
infection; which the experience of 
such trials plainly convinced me 
they could not. From these cases, 
therefore, it seems reasonable to sup-
pose, that this kind of artificial car-
buncle, caused by the inoculation, 
was alone capable of extricating from 
the human nature the first princi-
ples of this distemper. 

|P_36
From what hath been already 
advanced, it seems pretty certain 
that these first principles of the 
Small-pox, being susceptible of the 
contagion to the most distant extre-
mities, are diffused, in all parts 
alike, throughout the whole ani-
mal body; the principal caution, 
therefore, requisite to be observed 
by Physicians, in regard to those 
in whom this matter is to be ap-
plied, is to consider well their dif-
ferent constitutions and tempera-
ments, as they are of themselves 
naturally productive of the diffe-
rent kinds of the Small-pox. For 
it is, I believe, a generally receiv-
ed opinion that the contagious ve-
nom of this disease is in it's own 
nature the same, and differs only 
according to the different bodies it 
is infused into. In some, for in-
|P_37
stance, we see that this poison ap-
plied can produce no more than it's 
own variolous carbuncle, or a very 
few of the pustules at most, and 
those of the shortest duration; 
whereas, in others, it is manifest 
that the different fluids become 
more contaminated, and, therefore, 
consequently produce other diffe-
rent degrees of the Small-pox:
and wherever the lymphatick vessels
are corroded by the variolated acri-
mony, being more than can be 
transpired by the pores of the skin, 
it occasions a suffusion of the lym-
pha itself, and so consequently pro-
duceth a confluence of the Small-
pox; and this happening common-
ly in a greater degree on the head 
and face, is undoubtedly owing to 
the great force of the circulation 
of the blood, which, carrying 
|P_38
with it a variolated power, causes 
the effects above mentioned. The 
ventricles of the brain also, from 
the same morbose cause, are usu-
ally so affected as to occasion deli-
rium, &c; in the same manner 
probably, that the effluvia of strong 
drink and spirits affect the brain in 
drunkenness: for thus it is that the 
blood, having received any morbi-
fic taint, purifies itself in the cir-
culation, by throwing off it's he-
terogeneous particles by the com-
mon emunctories which nature 
hath provided, as far as the animal 
faculties, under a morbid state 
are capable of accomplishing it. 

Those principles in our nature, 
which are susceptible of the conta-
gion of the Small-pox, tho' they are 
not, I believe, as I have before ob-
served, liable to undergo a change, 
|P_39
by any power of medicine, suffici-
ent to prevent the influence of va-
riolous infection; yet experience 
convinceth us (if we can be so con-
vinced) that the manner of propa-
gating the distemper produceth a 
very different effect: and there can 
be no occasion to enforce the truth 
of this opinion by argument, since 
God's Providence hath appeared, 
in the success of inoculation, so 
much in favour of that practice[/6./]. 

FINIS.
