[}THE 
VIRTUES
AND 
EXCELLENCY
OF THE 
American Tobacco Plant. }]
THE Discovery and Con- 
quest of America by the 
Spaniards, enrich'd Europe
with not only vast Treasures of 
Gold and Silver, but also disco- 
ver'd and furnish'd us with (per- 

|P_4
haps) much more useful and valu- 
able things; to wit, many excel- 
lent Specific Remedies, for the 
Cure of Diseases, and Preservation 
of Health. 

Nature had been so kind to the 
poor ignorant Natives of that Coun- 
try, as to direct them to, and Ex- 
perience taught them, the peculiar 
Virtues of many Herbs, Roots, 
Plants, &c. growing amongst them, 
and how to apply them. 

The Learned Physicians in no 
Age had ever the Knowledge of a 
more celebrated Specific Remedy 
for any Distemper, than we in this 
last have found the Peruvian Bark 
to be, for a never failing and sud- 
den Cure of Intermitting Fevers 
and Agues: And to which alone, 
since it has been generally us'd, 
|P_5
more Lives have been owing, than 
to any other Medicine whatsoever. 
So wonderful is it in its Operation, 
that it looks almost like a Charm. 

But above all, their Tobacco 
Plant deserves to be plac'd in the 
first Rank, for its many amicable 
Qualities and Usefulness to Human 
Bodies, for the Cure of several 
Distempers, Preservation of Health, 
and Prolongation of Life. Besides 
the agreeable Diversion and Enter- 
tainment it affords to those that 
use it. The Indians by their plen- 
tiful Smoaking and Chawing it, 
find great Relief for their inward 
Diseases: And in case of Wounds 
or Ulcers, &c. they apply the 
Leaf, which eats away the proud 
Flesh, and inclines the Sore to 
heal. 

|P_6
It is an Opiat to those that are 
in Pain, makes the Poor forget 
their Necessities, supplies Food to 
the Hungry, making them bear 
the Want of it easily. It is well 
known how Armies have been en- 
abled to undergo tedious Marches, 
and Seamen long Voyages, with 
hardly any other Provision, when 
well supply'd with this. 

It is endued with a Salutiferous 
Sulphur, and hath also a Narcotic 
composing Quality, which gives 
Ease, Refreshment, and Tranqui- 
lity both to the Body and Mind 
Insomuch that it may seem to re- 
semble the Famous Herb mention- 
ed by Homer, that had the Power to 
turn Sadness into Joy. 

|P_7
The frequent Smoaking of To- 
bacco discharges Phlegm and other 
watry peccant Humours out of the 
Glands. It removes Obstructions 
in the Vessels, by dissolving the 
coagulated Juices: It promotes a 
due Circulation of the Blood, and 
a free Perspiration, thro' the Pores 
of the whole Body, so necessary to 
Health. It not only purges the 
Head, but with very many, ope- 
rates downwards, rendring the 
Bowels soluble, whereby costive 
Constitutions find great Benefit. 

It destroys Worms in Human 
Bodies, and is likewise by Experi- 
ence found to be a Remedy against 
Leprosies, Scurvy and Itch. To 
which the Poor (heretofore) inha- 
biting the Sea-Coast of this Island, 
were by their Eating too much Fish 
|P_8
very much subject: But since the 
smoaking of Tobacco came to be 
much in Use among them, they 
have been totally free from. 

Chawing Tobacco is by many 
prefer'd to Smoaking it, as being a 
greater Drain, and communicating 
its Virtues and Warmth more effe- 
ctually to the Stomach and Brain; 
preserving the Teeth, killing the 
Worms, and altering the Juices 
that occasion Pain and Rottenness 
in them

By the Chawing it, the Glands 
of the Jaws, Throat and Vessels 
being continually mov'd and com- 
press'd, dismiss or spue out great 
Quantities of Rheum, the Cause 
of Defluctions, Coughs, Catarrhs 
and Consumptions. It communi- 
cates also a certain Impulse to the 
|P_9
Membranes of the Lungs, which 
helps their Discharge of vicious 
Phlegm and other Matter, apt to 
breed Ulcers, Astma's, and other 
Distempers. It's observ'd by many, 
That those who from their Youth 
have been accustom'd to chaw To- 
bacco, are never afflicted (or at 
least very rarely) with Gout, Rheu- 
matisms, Scurvy, or Tooth-ach, 
which proceeds from an Acrimony 
in the Blood or Juices, that this 
Plant wonderfully helps to correct 
and sweeten. 

As Smoaking and Chawing of 
Tobacco, by Experience, is found 
to have these good Effects; so the 
using it by way of Snuff is bene- 
ficial, as well as diverting, to many 
Persons, (especially to such as have 
weak Eyes, affected with too 
much Moisture.) By its gently 
|P_10
pricking and stimulating the Mem- 
branes, it causes Sneezing or Con- 
tractions, whereby the Glands and 
Channels, like so many squeez'd 
Sponges, dismiss their Serosities 
and Filth. And as it serves for a 
Drain to excessive Moisture in the 
Eyes or Head; so when a sufficient 
Moisture is wanting, its quick and 
noble Spirit opens the Vessels that 
afford Supplies thereto; and pure 
Snuff put into the Corners of the 
Eyes is found to alter and destroy 
the sharp Humours that occasion 
Bloodshot, &c. So beneficial is this 
Powder for the Preservation of that 
most dear and valuable of all our 
Senses, the Sight. 

But Care ought to be taken, 
That the Snuff made use of in all 
these Cases be made of only pure 
clean Tobacco Leaves, without 
|P_11
any Mixture of Stiptic Earths, or 
Rotten Wood, which Common 
Snuff-makers put thereto to dea- 
den, colour, or else encrease the 
Quantity. 

Tobacco also is often a Remedy 
for Deafness, by putting a Drop 
of its Oyl into the Ear with Cotton 
Wool. 

But its most useful and excellent 
Quality is still to be mention'd; 
to wit, That it is the most sove- 
reign Antidote and greatest Preser- 
vative against the Plague, or other 
pestilential Diseases; the Small- 
Pox, or other Infection. 

The Turks and others, among 
whom the Plague often rages, have 
recourse to nothing more effectual to 
avoid it, than constant Smoaking of 
|P_12
Tobacco, Chawing, Snuffing, and 
burning it in their Rooms and 
Streets; and when the Pesti- 
lence is among them, many stuff 
their Bedding and Pillows with it. 
The Indians where it grows hang 
it about their Necks, and are sel- 
dom seen without a Pipe in their 
Hand. 

When the Plague raged so vio- 
lently in London, in the Year 1665. 
it's well known to many now living, 
how very few it seized of those that 
were constant Smoakers and Chaw- 
ers of Tobacco: And what was 
more remarkable, not any of those 
poor People, whose Employment 
was to manufacture, roll, or cut 
Tobacco, of which there were many 
Hundreds at work in several 
Houses within this City, were in- 
fected. 

|P_13
By these and many other Instan- 
ces which might be given, it is 
evident, that Tobacco wonderfully 
helps to purify the Air, and pre- 
vent Infection; so that it were 
very much to be wish'd, that in 
time of Pestilence and other infe- 
ctious Distempers, the Rich would 
be so charitable, as to supply the 
Poor with great Stores of this most 
useful Drug, and sovereign Anti- 
dote in such Cases; which may be 
a Means to put a stop to the raging 
of such Distempers, and preserve 
whole Families. 

But it is to be noted, there are 
many sorts and degrees of Tobacco 
Plants; and those highly prefera- 
ble, which grow in Climates and 
Soils natural to them, having a 
|P_14
light Earth and warm Sun, which 
gives that noble Flavour, Strength 
and Virtue to that Tobacco produc'd 
in Brazil, New-Spain, Virginia and 
Mary-land: Whereas that Plant 
raised in Northern Regions (where 
Tobacco-Plantations have of late 
mightily increased) has not only a 
faint, earthy Taste and Smell, but 
is also very unwholsom and perni- 
cious to those that use it. Instead 
of preserving, it destroys Health; 
which though not so immediately 
and sensibly felt by poor People of 
strong and robust Constitutions, yet 
it is certainly so much Poison suck'd 
into their Veins, which by Degrees 
consumes the Body, and often im- 
mediately causes Vomitings, Ver- 
tigo's and Convulsions. 

|P_15
To conclude, All Persons who 
love long Life and Health, will 
daily have Recourse to the Ameri- 
can Tobacco, as a noble Remedy; 
and shun that of the European
Growth, as Poison.
