|P_
[}TO THE Illustrious Prince JOHN, Duke of Montagu.}]May it please your Grace, 

YOUR Noble Ances- 
tors, have continued so Illustrious a Cha- 
racter to Posterity; that it is a great Happiness to find the 
|P_
same, equally shining in your Grace: A Character, so wor- 
thy of its Noble Origin, ex- 
celling both in Learning Vir- 
tue and Loyalty, that I should be vain to endeavour to draw that, which lyes out of the Power of my slender Pen. 

I shall therefore forbear to attempt, according to the u- 
sual Methods of Dedications, what I am not able to do Justice to, and shall only humbly beg the Favour to lay this Trifle at your Feet. 

A Trifle, not in respect of the Subject, being of the highest concern and worthy our Consideration, but only 
|P_
as it contains some brief Thoughts, sufficient to guard us from Dangerous Effects: for my Intention here was not to write a thorough or com- 
pleat Tract, but to propose just and necessary Cautions, against such Evils, which I chose to do in as few words as I could. 

The Honour your Grace hath been pleased to do the Faculty of Physick, in being a Fellow of the College, encourages me to hope that any thing that may seem Rea- 
sonable that way, may meet with your Graces favourable Acceptance and Patronage. 

|P_
If this Trifle shall seem so to your Grace, it will be the greatest Satisfaction and En- 
couragement to 
Your Graces Most Humble and Obedient Servant RICHARD BOULTON.

[}SOME 
THOUGHTS
CONCERNING 
The Unusual Qualities
OF THE 
AIR, &c.}]
SINCE all Creatures 
who have the Faculty 
of Respiration, and live 
upon the Superficies of 
this Terrestrial Globe, and inha- 
bit the several Climates of the known 
|P_2
World, are obliged to breathe the 
Common Air or Atmosphere they 
live in; and since not only those, 
but Mankind, whose Lives are more 
particularly valuable, as a Creature 
of the most Noble and first Rank, 
are subject to be altered and vari- 
ously affected, according to the dif- 
ferent Qualities of that Air; and 
to receive different Impressions, ac- 
cordingly as that is impregnated, 
and endowed with several various 
Extraneous Bodies, Vapours or Ef- 
flusions; and since these are not only 
likely to affect human Bodies ex- 
ternally through the Pores of the 
Skin, but internally, when sucked 
into the Lungs, into more tender 
and rarify'd Vessels, containing hu- 
mours more exquisitely rarify'd and 
expanded; and consequently are 
liable to be altered and depraved ac- 
cording to the various Dispositions 
of that Air we breathe, which may 
lay the foundations of Disorders and 
Distempers, pernicious and destructive 
|P_3
to human Bodies, as those extraneous 
Bodies, Vapours, or Effluviums are 
more or less unwholsome and of a 
different Nature; I say, since Hu- 
man Bodies are thus disposed and 
liable to be ill affected and disordered 
by the various Qualities of the Air 
we breathe, it is not only necessary 
but requisite we should consider, the 
different Qualities of that Air, and 
what Extraneous Bodies, Vapours, 
or Effluviums it may be impregnated 
and endowed with; and what alte- 
rations or ill Effects these may occa- 
sion and produce, either at the pre- 
sent, or for the future; and how far 
they may be prejudicial and perni- 
tious to Mankind. 

To determine and enable us to judge 
of the different Qualities of the Air, 
and what Extraneous Bodies or Va- 
pours it may be Impregnated and 
Endowed with, we are to consider, 
how many Ways it may be furnished 
with such Vapours or Effluviums; 
|P_4
which must be, either from foreign 
Globes, far distant from the Earth 
we live in, and from the Superficies 
of our Atmosphere; from extrane- 
ous Bodies, or Vapours emitted or 
rising from Bodies on the Superficies 
of our Globe; or from Vapours 
and Effluviums transuding and as- 
cending out of the Bowels of the 
Earth. 

As for those Globes which are vast- 
ly distant from the Earth we live in, 
and far remote from the Superficies 
of our Atmosphere, these are either 
the Stars, the Moon or the Sun. 

The Stars are so many Thousand 
Miles distant from us, and separated 
by such a spacious and boundless 
Aether or Medium, that we can but 
just perceive the Glimmering rays 
of those Celestial Bodies, which are 
sufficient to convince us that there 
are such Stupendious Effects of an 
Infinite Power; but they are so small, 
|P_5
that they can have but little Effects 
in altering the Qualities of the 
Air we Breathe; much less are they 
able to inform us, of the Nature of 
those distarit Globes; and conse- 
quently cannot afford us any know- 
ledge what Alterations such can pro- 
duce; only we may conclude, that 
where the Causes are small and scarce 
perceivable, the Effects must be in- 
considerable; and therefore can do 
little good, except as Luminaries, 
or produce not much ill; and con- 
sequently cannot contribute much 
to pervert it or deprave the Dispo- 
sition of our Air or Atmosphere. 

As for the Moon, though that is 
much nearer than any of the Stars, 
yet it is also placed at a great di- 
stance from the Superficies of the 
Earth, and separated by a vast ex- 
tent of fine Æther, which interposes 
betwixt that Globe and ours, 
and prevents it from any im- 
mediate Effects upon the Air we live 
|P_6
in; and though several Effects are 
attributed to it, because the Periods 
seem to keep time with its different 
Positions, yet it is contrary to all 
known Laws Statical or Hydrostatical, 
that it should have any Effect upon 
any Bodies contained within our At- 
mosphere, as having no immediate 
contact with terrene Bodies, but 
only upon that Aether, which equally 
encompasses and compresses the Su- 
perficies of our Vortex, and the ut- 
most Extent of the Globe we live 
and breathe upon or in; for the Air 
or Atmosphere may be properly said 
to be a part of our Globe though 
the most fluid and rarify'd Superficial 
covering of Earth and Water, and 
though Lunaticks, or those Distem- 
pers which grow worse at certain 
periods, seem to be equal in distance 
with the several Positions of the 
Moon, yet it cannot be demon- 
strated, that those Effects are owing 
to it as a Cause, since other periodi- 
cal Distempers keep an equal distance 
|P_7
betwixt their Periods, which depend 
upon Causes contained within the 
Limits of our own Bodies; and as 
for the Ebbing and Flowing of the 
Sea, that must proceed from some o- 
ther Cause, both Statical and Hy- 
drostatical Rules excluding it any 
share in these different Motions of 
that fluid Element; but not to en- 
ter upon Disputes of that Nature, 
which are foreign to our present pur- 
pose, we shall only observe, that 
the Beams of the Moon, which illu- 
minate our Globe; are only reflected 
Beams of the Sun transmitted into 
our Atmosphere, and not the proper 
Emanations or Effluviums of that 
Globe; and for as much as the Beams 
of the Sun reflected from other Sub- 
stances within our Globe, do not 
transmit to us the Nature of those 
Bodies they are reflected from, but 
are only variously modifyd and re- 
fracted in the Superficies of those 
Bodies, which different refractions 
variously affect our Sensory, or the 
|P_8
Organ of Sights, and produce the 
Sensation of different Colours or 
Refractions, and which only affect 
the Sense of Seeing, as they are 
stronger or weaker: Consequently 
we cannot expect, that the Beams of 
the Sun, reflected from the Super- 
ficies of the Moon, should convey 
to us the Qualities of that Body or 
Globe, especially since they are like- 
wise convey'd through so fine a Strai- 
ner as the interposed Aether, and re- 
fracted and altered also in passing 
through the great and lofty expanded 
part of our Atmosphere, which is 
reckoned, or computed, to be Seven 
Miles perpendicular in height, boying 
up a Pillar of Quicksilver in a Wea- 
ther-Glass, such a considerable height, 
till it amounts to an Aequilibrium, or 
equal Weight of a Pillar of Air, of 
the same Diameter and thickness, 
pressing upon the Basis, or Bottom 
of that Pipe the Mercury or Quick- 
silver is contained in. 

|P_9
As for the Sun, it is evident, that 
it acts upon all Bodies within our 
Atmosphere by Virtue of its Heat, 
since in the Summer time, when it is 
near enough, it rarifies, expands and 
digests the Superficial Juices of the 
Earth, as well those in our Bodies, 
which when fermented, attenuated 
and rarify'd, are pressed by the force 
of the incumbent Atmosphere in- 
to the Roots of Plants and Trees, 
and rise higher, as further rarify'd, 
press'd and expanded in the Vessels 
of each Plant, which being variously 
fermented and strained through dif- 
ferent Vessels along with Specifick 
Juices, are assimilated and converted 
into the proper Juices of those Plants. 

The Sun Beams also affect other 
Bodies on the Superficies of the 
Earth, and by their active Parts, put 
the Parts of other Substances in Mo- 
tion, and causes them to emit Va- 
pours and Effluviums, which, ac- 
cording to their different Natures 
|P_10
variously alter and affect the Air we 
breathe, and render it more or less 
wholesome and pernicious, Healthful 
or Destructive: But though the 
Sun hath such considerable Effects 
upon this Globe, when near us, yet 
when but a little further off in the 
Winter, we see that it hath little or 
no apparent Effects upon the Climate 
we live in; and if so small a dif- 
ference can extinguish the obvious 
Effects of so bright a Body as the 
Sun, we can scarce imagin, that the 
Moon or Stars which are much fur- 
ther off and Shine but faintly, should 
have any considerable Effects, or 
indeed any at all, especially since they 
cannot be perceived. 

It appearing hence, in a great Mea- 
sure, how the Air we breathe may 
be altered by Foreign Globes far 
distant from our Earth, we are next 
to consider how the Air we breathe 
in may be altered and depraved by 
Vapours and Effluviums emitted, 
|P_11
and arising from the Superficies of 
the Globe we inhabit, which appears 
from the vast variety of different 
Substances which may be observed 
on the Superficies of the Globe we 
live upon, which deprave the Natural 
Temper and Disposition of the Air, 
and consequently variously affect the 
Mass of Humours circulating through 
the minute and small Vessels con- 
tained in and dispersed through the 
Substance of the Lungs, such as pu- 
trify'd Bodies, and the constant E- 
manation of Vapours occasioned by 
standing Waters, and the unwhole- 
some Stenches which naturally flow 
from the products of Art, as well 
as Nature, which more particularly 
affect those Persons employed in 
such Arts, and more immediately 
exercised about them; thus we see 
the strange decay in those Persons 
which work in Pot-houses, Chymi- 
cal Elaboratories, and other employ- 
ments, where they are exposed to 
unwholesome Vapours and preternar- 
|P_12
tural Fumes. And these are further 
improved to an ill purpose, and 
grow more pernicious and unwhole- 
some, and deprave the wholesome 
Dispositon of the Air, when more 
forceably put in Action by the united 
force and heat of the Sun Beams. 

But the greatest and most con- 
siderable Alteration which the Air 
receives from the Extraneous mix- 
ture of Vapours and Effluviums, 
seems to be from such as transude 
and ascend out of the Bowels of the 
Earth, whether of a Mineral kind or 
of any other Nature. And as such 
sort of Vapours and Effluviums are 
most likely to produce great and ex- 
traordinary Alterations, so cones- 
quently those Alterations are pro- 
bably most pernicious, and of the 
worst consequence, and aptest to oc- 
casion the worst of Accidents in hu- 
man Bodies. 

|P_13
From such kind of Vapours dif- 
fervently agitated and put in Action 
by the nearer approach, or greater 
distance of the Sun, seems to arise 
that great variety of Climates, not 
only in the same Latitude, but se- 
veral Parts of the Terrestrial Globe; 
for accordingly as the Air is variously 
affected with such Effluviums of dif- 
ferent kinds, these Vapours being 
put in Action by the heat of the Sun 
Beams produce different Effects, and 
render the Air in such Climates 
more or less wholesome, pernicious 
and depraved: Thus Agues are 
more frequent in Kent, and other Di- 
stempers more common and custom- 
mary in different Parts of the World. 

When by the Constant and Custo- 
mary transmission of particular Va- 
pours and Effluviums, any Country 
is frequently or constantly subject to 
such Diseases; these Distempers are 
said to be Endemical or proper to 
that particular Climate; but when 
|P_14
Contagious or Malignant Distempers 
happen to rage more than commonly 
or accidentally in any Place, such 
Disorders are called Epidemical, or 
spreading at some particular Times, 
arising from the accidental Discharge 
and Ascension of particular Vapours 
out of the Bowels of the Earth at 
that Time. 

The Temper of the Air in dif- 
ferent Climates is also altered dif- 
ferently according to the Quantity 
as well as Quality of such Vapours, 
and as the Air is more plentifully or 
sparingly impregnated with such pre- 
ternatural Vapours, which also in the 
same Climates exert themselves more 
or less vigorously according to the 
different Seasons of the Year. Thus 
in Summer time Contagious or Ma- 
lignant Distempers rage more vigo- 
rously and universally and are less Epi- 
demical in the Winter. 

|P_15
And as the Temper and Disposition 
of the Air varies according to dif- 
ferent Climates, the various quan- 
tities of Mineral Effluviums, and the 
different Seasons of the Year; so we 
find a vast difference according to the 
Nature and Qualities of such Mineral 
Vapours. Some Minerals afford very 
wholesome and Salutiferous Steams, 
whilst others are dangerous and per- 
nicious. Thus the Mines in Cornwall
make the Country wholesome and 
healthful, whilst others produce Con- 
tagious and Pestilential Qualities, 
which render such Countries frequent- 
ly subject to such Distempers. 

Those Mineral Effluviums or Va- 
pours which produce Pestilential Dis- 
eases, are of a most pernicious 
kind, and are attended with very 
violent and most fatal Symptoms, 
and such are esteemed, by that most 
Worthy and profound Judge of the 
Works of Nature, the Honourable 
Robert Boyle, to be of an Arsenical 
|P_16
kind, producing Effects of the most 
Malignant and Poisonous Nature, 
being most offensive and destructive 
to Human Bodies. 

It appearing then from what we 
have said, that the Temper of the 
Air, and its most Unusual Qualities, 
which are likewise most destructive 
and dangerous, chiefly depend on 
the Effluviums or Vapours rising out 
of the Bowels of the Earth, when- 
ever we find the Temper and Dispo- 
sition of any Climate to vary and 
differ from what it commonly does 
in such Climates, we have good rea- 
son to conclude, that the Air is Im- 
pregnated with some unusual Efflu- 
viums out of the Bowels of this Ter- 
restrial Globe, which being mixed 
with and dispersed through the Air 
produce that uncommon Indispo- 
sition. 

And since we are constantly obli- 
ged to breathe the Air we live in, and 
|P_17
to impregnate our Blood with such 
Heterogeneous and offensive Particles, 
which perverting the Course of Na- 
ture may produce ill Effects in human 
Bodies, we ought to be very careful 
to guard our selves against such Ac- 
cidents as may be Destructive, and 
so prejudicial to Mankind, and to 
make use of necessary precautions to 
prevent such ill Accidents, as such 
Inconveniencies may render us liable 
to. 

It cannot be out of our Memory 
what fatal Consequences have lately 
happened Abroad, especially in the 
South Parts of France; and how 
many Thousands have been destroy- 
ed by the fatal Effects of an ill dis- 
posed Temper of the Air, so Mor- 
tal and Epidemical. And as other 
Parts of the World may be likely to 
suffer by Accidents, and may be 
liable to the same approaching Dan- 
gers, by hidden Vapours and Efflu- 
viums transmitted from the inward 
|P_18
Parts of the Earth, and by Mineral 
Effluviums of a Malignant kind; 
whenever we find any unusual Quality 
in the Air, we have a great deal of 
Reason to be afraid of some unusual 
Accidents, and to make use of all 
necessary precautions to prevent 
them. If such ill and Malignant 
Qualities should be convey'd from 
the inward Parts of the Earth into 
our Atmosphere, such cautionary 
Preparations would arm us the bet- 
ter against their ill Effects; and tho' 
no such danger, as we might justly 
fear, should happen, yet at least we 
should reap this advantage by our 
jealous surmises, that we should free 
our Bodies of ill disposed Humours, 
and put our selves in a better State 
and Condition of Health; so that 
our Labour would not be ill bestow- 
ed and fruitless, nor our Pains ill re- 
warded; the just Cautions to arm 
our selves against the greatest of 
Dangers, would at least secure us 
against less Evils. 

|P_19
 And that at the present, we have 
very probable Grounds and substan- 
tial Reasons to fear some impending 
Evil, and future Danger, which may 
too suddenly happen in our Climate, 
and consequently we ought to make 
use of proper Methods to prevent 
such Events, will in a great measure 
appear, if we consider the Steps arid 
Progress of Malignant or Pestilen- 
tial Distempers in former Times, and 
also the Intemperies of our Climate 
for some time past, and at the present 
time; which may give us sufficient 
grounds to suspect the consequential 
Intemperature of the Air for the fu- 
ture, or time to come. 

As for the Steps and Progress of 
Malignant or Pestilential Distempers, 
formerly it hath been observed, that 
the Pestilence took its Course suc- 
cessively through several Parts of 
Europe, beginning first in Asia, and 
then runing through Italy, Germany, 
Denmark, Sweden, England, &c. In 
|P_20
Turkey it is Endemical, and con- 
stantly appears every Year; but this 
in a great measure depends on the 
excessive Heats of the Climate, and 
their way of living; their Blood be- 
ing too much phlegmated to support 
and supply a sufficient Diaphoresis or 
Sweat, in the Time of excessive 
Heat, and this is, in a great measure, 
occasioned by their Abstinence, ac- 
cording to Mahomet's Laws, from 
Spiritous Liquors, which might suf- 
ficiently attenuate the Serum of the 
Blood, and render it apt for Tran- 
spiration, so that when the Mass of 
Humours begin to be fermented with 
Heat, the phlegmatick Parts of 
the whole are too great in Quanti- 
ty, and too gross in Quality to be 
discharged according to the ordinary 
Course of Nature. 

But it appear'd lately in France
without any Mask or Excuse to hide 
the Evident Cause of its Malignancy, 
it plainly appearing to proceed from 
|P_21
Contagious Parts of Matter dispersed 
through the Air, which, from what 
hath been said, appear to be supply'd 
by Subterraneous Mineral Effluviums, 
or Vapours, proceeding out of the 
Bowels of the Earth, Which God Al- 
mighty preserve us from! 

But it is too much to be feared, 
that some Heterogeneous Particles, or 
Malignant Vapours and Effluviums 
have, and are, too much dispersed 
through our Atmosphere, or the Air 
which we now breathe in our Cli- 
mate; and this will appear too likely, 
if we observe, that near the whole 
Twelve Months last past, the Nitrous 
Parts of the Air have almost been to- 
tally overpower'd, and hindered from 
producing their Natural Effects as 
usual in this Climate: For we may 
observe, that most of the last Sum- 
mer was not only hot and dry, but 
that most of the last Winter ap- 
peared more like Summer than 
Winter Weather, there being little 
|P_22
appearance of either Frost or Snow, 
to what is usual in this Climate; 
and we at the present find, that the 
Heat of the Weather hath some time 
exceeded what it hath for several Years 
last past, which if it should encrease 
proportionally, as the Sun ap- 
proaches, it must render the hottest 
Season of the Year excessively so; 
and consequently must produce ex- 
ceeding Malignant Distempers, if not 
Pestilential. 

And that we may reasonably con- 
clude, that such Intemperatures of the 
Air proceed from Subterraneous Va- 
pours, or Effluviums, which not only 
over-power the Nitrous Parts of the 
Air, but are put and excited into a 
preternatural Fermentation by the 
heat of the Sun; I say, we may 
reasonably deduce this Conclusion, 
since the Sun would have its constant 
and certain effect at the same Distance, 
and consequently, that the Differen- 
ces must proceed from some Hetero- 
|P_23
geneous Particles, which concur 
to produce such Alterations and 
Differences in the Natural Disposition 
of the Air in one Climate. 

And that the Air is too much Im- 
pregnated with some Heterogeneous 
Vapours, is evident from the Mala- 
dies which have lately afflicted several 
Persons, as particular Feverish Heats 
and Indispositions, attended with 
Pains in the Head and dizziness, and 
other Symptoms much different from 
those which appear in Phthisis or any 
usual Distempers. 

If then, as we may well conclude, 
or, at least suspect, the Air we breathe, 
is impregnated with Heterogeneous 
Particles, as it seems to appear, not 
only from what we have mentioned, 
but the sudden and surprising Death 
of several Persons, especially of late, 
since we continually suck in, and 
imbibe these Heterogeneous Particles 
into our Blood in Respiration, it 
|P_24
seems worth our while to consider 
what Methods are proper to prevent 
their ill Effects, if either it should 
happen, that the Air should be more 
plentifully impregnated with such 
Particles, or by long breathing them 
into our Lungs, the Mass of Blood 
should be more strongly impregnated 
with them, so as to enable them to 
produce their ill Effects more vigo- 
rously. 

In order to assign proper Methods 
to this purpose, it will be requisite 
to consider, what Causes commonly 
concur to produce Malignant Pesti- 
lential Distempers, front whence it 
will appear, what Methods may be 
proper and most expedient to prevent 
such Maladies, and to secure Man- 
kind from such Dangers as may hap- 
pen, without the over-ruling hand of 
Providence to divert such pernicious 
Qualities which may be more plen- 
tifully emitted out of the Bowels of 
|P_25
the Earth, and dispersed through 
the infected Air we breathe in. 

And, first, From what hath been 
said, it appears sufficiently, that the 
Antecedent Cause of Malignant or 
Pestilential Distempers depends on, 
and is composed of extraneous ma- 
lignant Mineral Vapours, or Exhala- 
tions rising out of the Bowels of the 
Earth and Impregnating the Air we 
breathe with pernicious Particles. 

These Mineral Effluviums or Va- 
pours, First and Primarily affect Hu- 
man Bodies, and being sucked into 
the Lungs in Breathing gradually im- 
pregnate the whole Mass of Blood 
with their Poisonous Steams. 

These Poisonous Particles of Mi- 
neral Vapours, at the first are so 
small in quantity, that they are not 
able to produce any ill Effects, be- 
ing lodged and harboured amongst 
the more Phlegmatick and gross Parts 
|P_26
of the Animal Humours; but being 
gradually collected to a greater quan- 
tity they exert themselves more 
powerfully, and the gross Parts of 
the Blood being attenuated and sub- 
tilised by their corrosive Qualities, or 
at least some part of them, they are 
no longer able to cloak and skreen 
them from shewing their corrosive 
Qualities. 

The Mass of Blood being thus 
gradually more strongly impregnated 
with these depraved and Heteroge- 
neous Particles, and some Parts of 
the Mass of Humours attenuated by 
their corrosive Qualities, they begin 
to discover those Qualities; run them 
into a more fluid form by their cor- 
rosive Faculty, and separating them 
from the rest, the perfect Mixture of 
the Mass of Humours is by this 
means broke, and made an imper- 
fected Mixture, the grosser Parts be- 
ing cast off and separated from the 
thinner, and by this means rendered 
|P_27
unapt and unfit for Circulation; the 
grosser Parts occasion Obstructions 
in the small and minutest Vessels, 
whilst the more thin and corrosive 
corrode and destroy the continuity 
of the Vessels, whose joint Effects 
make such a sad Catastrophe in hu- 
man Bodies, and putting the whole 
fabrick into disorder, produce those 
ill Symptoms in Pestilential and Ma- 
lignat Distempers; as Tumours, 
Ulcers, Inflammations, Deliriums, 
Mortifications and Death: In the 
Glandulous Parts they produce 
Buboes, in the fleshy Pares Car- 
buncles and Blotches, in the Nervous 
Parts, especially the Membranes of 
the Brain, Inflammation, Delirium 
and Phrensy, in the Glandulous 
Parts of the Brain, and other noble 
Parts, violent Symptoms and sud- 
den Death. 

These Malignant and Pestilential 
Distempers being thus formed, and 
the Blood strongly Impregnated with 
|P_28
destructive Vapours as well as the 
Air, the Distemper begins to be 
more contagious and spreading; the 
ill Effluviums heaped up in human 
Bodies now exerting themselves 
powerfully, and breaking out of 
those Repositories, unite with those 
contained in the Air, and more 
strongly affect those Persons about 
them; and thus the Infection is spread 
and promoted Secondarily, these 
Effluviums from human Bodies u- 
niting with those contained in the 
Air, and those already collected in 
the Mass of Blood. 

But besides these Primary and 
Secundary Antecedent Causes to pro- 
duce Malignant and Pestilential Di- 
stempers, there are other accessory 
and Concurring Causes requisite; 
for since all are not equally subject 
to them, but several continue a long 
time amongst such Persons without 
prejudice, till at the last their Consti- 
tutions are gradually depraved and 
|P_29
more strongly affected with the Ve- 
nemous Exhalations. 

This Accessory concurring Cause, 
must be a particular Disposition in 
the Blood, to retain, and be affected 
by these Infectious Vapours or Efflu- 
viums of the Earth, and human 
Bodies; otherwise all People would 
be equally subject to be Infected at 
the same time. To discover this 
Disposition, we are to consider, that 
whatever is contained in the Mass of 
Blood, as long as it is thin enough 
to circulate through the Vessels, there 
is no danger of Obstruction, and con- 
sequently there can no damage 
happen, except it be too thin, and 
corrosive, and opening the Extremi- 
ties, or otherwise corroding and de- 
stroying the Continuity of the Ves- 
sels occasions an Extravasation; but 
even to produce that Effect, the Hu- 
mours must be very sharp before they 
can break the Vessels, as long as they 
circulate freely, since they stay not 
|P_30
long enough in any Part to produce 
that Effect, and therefore we may 
well conclude that there must be 
Viscocity also in the Blood, and that 
those viscous Parts being either too 
thick to circulate, or separate from 
the rest, first cause an Obstruction 
and detain these corrosive Humours, 
the perfect Mixture of the Blood be- 
ing first broke and destroy'd by those 
Contagious Parts. 

Indeed when the Vessels are too 
much crouded and extended with 
Humours, as in Plethorick Bodies, 
Corrosive Particles crouded and im- 
pelled by the force of Circulation 
into the small Pores of the Vessels, 
may too much extend them and con- 
tribute to separate and divide the 
continuity of their Parts; but since 
there is Naturally a Viscocity in the 
Blood and Serum, and this may be, 
and frequently is too great; this u- 
nited with those Corrosive Qualities, 
and retaining them, will give them 
|P_31
a greater opportunity of Corrosion. 
Thus a Viscous Phlegm retaining a 
sharp Humour upon the Top of the 
Stomach or Ventricle, where there 
is a plentiful Distribution of Nerves, 
causes a corroding Pain at the Sto- 
mach, called Heart-burn; and 
in the Membranes, about the 
Musculous Parts, occasions Rheu- 
matick Pains, especially where they 
are most Sensible and incapable of 
Extension; and the Membranes of the 
Joints corroded with a sharp or Au- 
stere Viscous Matter produce those 
excessive Pains of the Gout, where 
the Obstruction so much retains those 
sharp Humours that they corrode 
the Vessels in pieces, and occasion 
such an extravasation of this Viscous 
Matter as to produce and form 
Nodes. 

From hence it plainly appearing 
that a predisposition in the Blood is 
an accessory concurring Cause, and 
that this predisposed Humour, is a 
|P_32
Viscous gross Humour, which retains 
and heaps up the Contagious Par- 
ticles of the Air we imbibe, and 
draw in with our Breath, it con- 
sequently follows, that the Conjunct 
Cause, or Matter of the Disease is, 
Contagious Particles lodged first in 
a Viscous Humour, which was an 
accessory Antecedent Cause, and 
disengaged or separated from the 
sharp Humour, and causing Ob- 
structions, becomes along with that 
sharp Contagious Humour, a Con- 
junct Cause, and both together make 
up the Material Cause, or the Mor- 
bifick Matter of the Disorder and 
Distemper, which according to the 
Degrees, produces more Malignant 
Diseases, and when abounding in an 
extraordinary degree, even the Pesti- 
lence, which is so obnoxious and fa- 
tal to Mankind. 

And that a Viscous Matter, along 
with the Contagious Particles, is the 
Conjunct Cause, and produces Ma- 
|P_33
lignant and Pestilential Distempers, 
is evident from hence, since all Peo- 
ple are not equally subject to such 
Distempers, and some never have 
any at all, though they live in a 
Contagious Air, and amongst In- 
fected Persons; and that a Viscous 
predisposition of Blood is necessary 
as a concurring Cause is manifest; 
for as long as the Humours are suf- 
ficiently attenuated, though sharp 
corrosive Particles are imbibed into 
the Blood, and mixed with it in 
Respiration, they are soon discharged 
and separated from it again, by the 
common Emunctories and discharges 
of Nature, as by Sweat, Transpi- 
ration, Urine or Stool, before they 
can have any time or power to alter 
and corrupt the Blood by destroying 
its Texture and Mixture, for the 
constant Agitation and Circulation 
of the Blood preserves its Mixture 
along time when kept in perpetual 
Motion; but when the Blood is 
too thick it retains a greater Quan- 
|P_34
tity, hinders the Natural Discharge, 
and consequently tends to heap up 
Infectious Particles. 

Besides, when the Blood abounds 
with Viscous Parts, it produces a 
larger Discharge or Separation of 
Phlegmatick Parts, when its Texture 
and Mixture is imperfect, which oc- 
casion Obstructions, and concur to 
produce Malignant Symptoms, when 
thrown Critically upon the minute 
Vessels or Glands of any Part. 

When any such Critical Discharge 
is made, and a Malignant or Pesti- 
lential Distemper is formed, and 
properly in esse or factu, that is, per- 
fectly formed, the Antecedent, con- 
junct and Accessory Causes along 
with the Symptoms produced, make 
up the formal Cause, which is the 
Disease and its Symptoms. 

But to compleat this, there is one 
Cause accessory, which is the Proca- 
|P_35
tartick Cause, or that which puts 
the Antecedent Causes in Action; 
as any sudden Passion of the Mind, 
and the ill use of Non-Naturals, or 
the force of Imagination; but that 
which is chiefly so and External, is 
the approaching Heat and Activity 
of the Sun Beams, which put those 
Contagious Effluviums, Vapours or 
Exhalations, in Action more briskly, 
by encreasing the Degrees of Fer- 
mentation or Digestion, the Conse- 
quence of which we may justly 
fear and dread; for if such Conta- 
gious Effluviums are in the Air, and 
should encrease, it may reasonably 
be feared, that Contagious Distem- 
pers may happen more or less Ma- 
lignant, if not Pestilential, accord- 
ing to the Degrees of the Primary 
Antecedent Cause, Viz. Extraneous 
Mineral Exhalations, Vapours or 
Effluviums, from which God Al- 
mighty, or Art, must preserve us, if 
they should by the course of Natu- 
ral Causes break forth. 

|P_36
From what hath been said, it 
appears what just cause we have 
to dread the ill Consequences of 
Contagious Vapours, which we 
may too reasonably suspect. It 
may therefore be requisite to con- 
sider, what Methods are most 
proper to prevent and avert the E- 
vent, and Consequences of such 
dreadful Causes; which may easily 
be deduced from what hath been 
said: For if Contagious Vapours 
are retained by a Viscous Indispo- 
sition of Blood, and sharp Cor- 
rosive Humours or Vapours, col- 
lected and run into a Fluor, destroy 
the Texture and Mixture of the 
Blood, and by this Means produce 
the Symptoms of Malignant or Pesti- 
lential Distempers, the proper In- 
tentions to prevent such Accidents, 
must be to Correct and Discharge 
that Viscous Matter which retains 
Contagious Vapours, as well as to 
correct and prevent the ill Effects of 
those Infectious Effluviums; it being 
|P_37
impossible either to prevent Mineral 
Exhalations, which is the Primary 
Antecedent Cause, or to hinder and 
obstruct the Sun's approach, which 
is the Principal Procatartick Cause, 
though sometimes the Antecedent 
Cause, when encreased to a great 
Degree, and plentifully heaped up, 
may also be a Procatartick Cause, 
and put it self in Action. 

Since then the Principal Intentions 
to prevent Malignant or Pestilential 
Distempers are to remove the Na- 
tural Indisposition, which retains 
Contagious Vapours, and to correct 
those Vapours, or Malignant Par- 
ticles which destroy the Texture of 
the Blood, and produce such fatal 
Consequences, we are to consider 
what is most reasonable to be done. 

As for the Air, it is of such vast 
Extent, and the Superficies of the 
Earth so large, that it will be hard 
to deal with so extensive a Subject 
|P_38
Physically, but in the Compass of a 
human Body we may be more likely 
to deal with them. 

As for the Predisposition of the 
Blood which renders human Bodies 
most likely to retain them, and 
to heap up Contagious Particles, 
since that is a Viscous Humour, it 
is obvious to those who have taken 
Pains in Physick, what Intentions 
are requisite to that purpose; as 
Bleeding and Purging, for Bleeding 
emptying the Vessels makes room 
for Fluids to dilute and thin the rest, 
and Purging discharges a grosser Hu- 
mour than passes off by any other 
Natural way, which Nature makes 
use of. 

And to correct those Contagious 
Vapours which may already be 
heaped up in the Blood, or may 
hereafter be contracted, since they 
would pass off, if nothing was in 
the Way to obstruct them, without 
|P_39
destroying the Texture of the Blood, 
since thin Humours flow best off by 
Diaphoresis, or through the Pores of 
the Skin, when the gross Humours 
are removed by Bleeding and Purge- 
ing Alexipharmick Diaphoreticks, 
seem most proper for that purpose, 
which may correct those Malignant 
Vapours and discharge them, and 
consequently preserve the Texture 
and due Mixture of the Blood, and 
prevent those Malignant and fatal 
Consequences. 

As for particular forms for this 
purpose, I need not direct Physicians, 
they being able to prescribe for 
themselves; but every Body not 
being Physicians, or able, or willing 
to employ them, as too expensive, 
I shall recommend some Medicines 
convenient for that purpose, to the 
use of those who think it worth 
their while to preserve their Health, 
and guard themselves from future ill 
Consequences. 

|P_40
And, as I said before, it may not 
be amiss to pursue such measures, for 
they will at least have this advantage, 
that if Pestilential Distempers hap- 
pen not; they will still guard them- 
selves from the Dangers of Malig- 
nant Distempers, which will be worth 
their while, and reward their Care 
of their Health, and preseve a good 
Constitution. 

Indeed for the sake of those who 
cannot afford to imploy a Physician 
I should have laid down forms for 
their use, that they might apply 
themselves to Apothecaries, but 
some of them are too apt to adulte- 
rate Medicines, and leave out any 
Ingredients that are dear, though 
most useful and necessary; besides in 
the several Books I have already 
writ, I have been so free that way, 
that several, though they have made 
use of them to their Advantage, yet 
they have not had the Civility to 
acknowledge the freedom, in a way 
|P_41
customary to those who have been 
educated in Physick, though it hath 
been the whole business and study of 
my Life, since I left School Edu- 
cation. 

If therefore any one shall think it 
worth their while to take care of 
their Health, and guard themselves 
from future ill Consequences, after 
Bleeding to attenuate the Humours, 
to discharge the Viscous Humour, 
though I hate any thing that looks 
like common Quackery, not- 
withstanding the Art of Physick 
was built upon it, I shall recom- 
mend particular Medicines for that 
purpose already prepared, with Di- 
rections for their Use. Yet if any 
shall apply themselves to me for 
Advise, I shall not scruple to pre- 
scribe, let them make use of who 
they please. But to proceed from 
this accidental Digression. 

The properest Purge which I 
should recommend upon this occa- 
sion, is Dr. Sagittary's Elixir, a Me- 
|P_42
dicine of Excellent Use, and dis- 
charging obnoxious Humours with a 
great deal of Safety. This ought 
to be taken once or twice a Week, 
working gently, and by making a 
gradual discharge without too much 
force upon Nature, and therefore 
most agreeable to human Bodies; 
I have no Interest in recommending 
this Excellent Medicine, but only 
the good of Mankind. 

Those Days which are free from 
Purging, they may take an  Anti-ma- 
lignant and Antipestilential Tincture, 
which will correct those Contagious 
Vapours, and expel them out of 
the Blood, gently through the Pores 
of the Skin, without the trouble or 
force of immoderate Sweat, or any 
sensible sweating at all, taking 
a Spoonful every Morning, and 
at Night going to Bed, in a Glass 
of Wine and Water, or Wine only, 
or in Beer, if any shall like it ra- 
ther. 

|P_43
It also preserves the due Mixture 
and Crasis of the Mass of Blood 
and Humours, preserving human 
Bodies from Contagious Infection, 
whether from those more Malignant 
or Pestilential Effluviums, or Va- 
pours dispersed through the Air, 
from the Superficial or Subter- 
raneous Parts of the Earth, or from 
the Bodies of Infected Persons. 

It also preserves human Bodies in 
such a perfect state of Health, that
it prevents and guards them from the 
ill Effects of such less Indispositions 
and Intemperatures as occasion and 
render Mens Bodies liable to Agues
or Intermitting Fevers, as in Kent
or Essex; where it will be of singu- 
lar and universal Use, if frequently
made use of in those Climates. 

It will likewise, if frequently made
use of, contribute to prevent the 
spreading of that Contagious and 
Infectious Distemper the Small-Pox, 
or at least render the Blood of so 
wholesome a Disposition, by clean- 
|P_44
sing it of its Impurities, that if it 
does not totally prevent them, yet 
it will render them less virulent, or 
much milder and less dangerous, and 
prevent the unnecessary hazard and 
danger of Inoculation, a new con- 
trived Practise which only forestalls 
future by present Sickness, and ha- 
stens on that Inconveniency which 
would be effected or happen at a 
greater distance of Time, or perhaps 
not at all. 

And that the Small-Pox depends 
on a particular Disposition of the 
Air, which destroys the due mixture 
of the Mass of Blood, and makes 
an Alteration in its Texture is very 
evident, since we see, that this Dis- 
ease is often times Epidemical, and 
rages more universally at one time 
than another. 

And that the Disposition of the 
Air, in this Case, destroys the Tex- 
ture of the Blood, appears from the 
Symptoms of it, for we see, that the 
grosser Particles of the Blood, in 
|P_45
that Disease, are not only separated 
from the rest, but that they are cri- 
tically cast off in the Glands of the 
Skin; which evidently appears, since 
as the Air is impregnated with par- 
ticular Vapours, milder, or more 
sharp and biteing, the Pox are of a 
benign kind, or Corrosive, and oc- 
casion Pits, or Exulcerations which 
leave disfiguring Marks behind them. 

But in this Distemper there is not 
only a depraved Indisposition in the 
Air, but likewise a Predisposition in 
the Mass of Humours is requisite 
which from the Symptoms appears 
to be Viscous, and to depend per- 
haps on the faults of Digestion, and 
Crudities thus congested in their 
Infancy, but this we have not time 
or room to consider thoroughly. 

I shall only add, that to prevent 
this Distemper the Purgeing Elixir 
may be used once a Week, and the 
Tincture before-mentioned those 
Days that are free from Purgeing, and 
for some time after, which are also 
|P_46
frequently to be repeated; the Quan- 
tity to be proportioned according to 
the Person's Age, Directions for which 
will be given along with that Tincture. 

[}Of the Differences of Contagious Vapours. }]
Since in the foregoing Sheets we 
have taken Notice, that Malignant and 
Contagious Distempers depend on, and 
are occasioned by pernicious Vapours 
and Exhalations rising out of the 
Bowels or the Superficial Parts of the 
Earth, impregnating the Air we 
breathe, and acting upon Bodies pre- 
indisposed, and furnished with Viti- 
ous depraved Humours; we shall 
briefly add something of the differ- 
ences of those Contagious Vapours 
and Exhalations which produce these 
different Effects; the Effects varying, 
as we before took notice, according 
to the variety of the Causes. 

And first Watry Exhalations ren- 
der the Air thick and moist, and ob- 
noxious to Athmatick Persons, and 
those that have moist Lungs; these 
|P_47
with Nitrous acid Effluviums occasi- 
on Agues, The Famous Mr. Boyle
Observing that a particular Acid mix- 
ed with a Volatile, produces a Cold 
Effervency; In the Small-Pox, the 
Mixture of the Blood is Broke by 
Vitriolick Vapours or Effluviums, 
which appears from the Curdling 
Effects, which produce Tumours in 
the Skin, and also from the Nauseous 
Smell attending that Disease. Malig- 
nant Fevers depend on a higher degree 
of corrosive Mineral Salts, producing 
a higher degree of Crudities, and 
much more than Nature can digest, 
throw off or discharge. In Pestilen- 
tial Distempers the Effluviums are of 
a more Malignant kind, and rather of 
an Arsenical Nature, producing 
Symptoms of a proportionable De- 
gree of Malignancy and more per- 
nicious. 

How these Malignant Effects may 
be prevented, we have already obser- 
ved, and where this Tincture may be 
had, I shall annex by way of Adver- 
ment.
