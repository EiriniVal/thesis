SIR, 

[^Decorative frame around the letter "T".^]THE following Enquiry 
containing several Par-
ticulars, which, tho' 
they have not been hitherto 
|P_ii
either regarded, or perhaps un-
derstood by vulgar Anatomists, 
may not on those Accounts at 
all the less tend to illustrate the 
surprizing Structure of Animal 
Bodies, requires the Protection 
of One, whose known Abilities 
in every Branch of Physick, 
may silence the Cavils of those, 
whose Penetration ends with 
the Edge of their Knife, or the 
Flowing of an Injection. This 
Consideration alone, had I no 
other, is a sufficient Warrant 
for my Application to you. 
But if the spontaneous confer-
ring of Favours on such, as 
|P_iii
had no Claim to them, but the 
mere Benevolence of the Do-
nor, demands a publick Ac-
knowledgment; I should be 
wholly unpardonable, did I not 
take this Opportunity of re-
turning you my Thanks for 
those singular Lights you was 
pleased to afford me during 
my Attendance at St. Thomas's 
Hospital, where I had not only 
my own Doubts resolved, but 
new Steps pointed out, by 
that uncommon Sagacity, which

these, Sir, were the Motives 
of this my Application to you, 
I thought myself excusable in 
not acquainting you with it, 
lest you should prevent me 
from thus acknowledging the 
Obligations I lie under, as well 
as declaring how much I am,

[}AN 
ENQUIRY
Into the 
EXILITY of the VESSELS
In a 
Human Body, &c.}]
[^Decorative frame around the letter "T".^]THE Structure of the Ani-
mal Body, whether we con-
sider the Size, Situation and 
Uses of its larger and more complex 
Parts, with relation to each other, and 
their Subservience to the whole, or 
by diving deeper into the secret and 
|P_
more mysterious Parts of Nature, we 
scrutinize the several Parts of which 
these are composed, exhibits to our 
View such an amazing Scene of un-
bounded Power and Wisdom, as in-
finitely exceeds all the Contrivance 
of the rest of the visible Creation, 
how great the Bodies, or astonishing 
soever their Motions and Revolutions 
may upon a strict Enquiry appear 
to us. 

###Greek omitted###[/1./].
But tho' this Position is sufficiently 
evident from the Structure of every 
Organ in the Animal Body, yet it is 
in no Part so singularly astonishing, 
as in the Growth of Animals, from 
their first original Stamina in the Ani-
|P_3
malcule, till they arrive at their ap-
pointed Size. 

That every Vessel and Fibre in the 
Body is contained in Miniature in an 
Animalcule, few, I believe, will dis-
pute, it being absolutely impossible, 
that mere Matter and Motion, with-
out its being conducted by the Vessels 
proper to an Animal, should produce 
an Animal at all; and still more ab-
surd, if there can be Degrees in Ab-
surdity, to suppose such a Cause ca-
pable of producing that Variety of 
Species, in their regular Order, which, 
we see, is constantly kept up thro' so 
great a Series of Years and Genera-
tions; but that instead of a Calf, a 
Cow might as naturally produce a 
Lion, Camel, or any other Creature, 
|P_4
as frequently as its own proper Spe-
cies. 

Besides, could the Parts or Limbs, 
or even the most minute Organ be 
produced by the Motion of the Fluids, 
without their being conducted by 
the Vessels of the Organ itself already 
latent in the Stamina, what should 
hinder, why any Part taken away 
by Amputation should not again be 
perfectly formed and restored, since 
all the adductory Vessels continue in 
their former State, and are capable 
of supplying the same Fluids as be-
fore? Consequently since the most 
minute Organ cannot be supplied by 
any other than the forementioned 
Method, can any thing be so absurd, 
as to suppose that all the regular Or-
|P_5
der of Vessels necessary to compose the 
whole Bodily Machine should be pro-
duced by such a Cause, as is utterly 
incapable of forming the least Part 
imaginable in a regular Manner? This 
is no less exemplified in the Seeds or 
proper Embryos of Plants. Thus 
the Seed of the Fir-tree, whose Bulk 
with all its Integuments scarce equals 
the Head of the smallest Pin, has its 
Fibres and Vessels so enlarged by the 
Addition of fresh Particles, as to grow 
to an enormous Size, without ever de-
viating (in whatever Soil it grows) 
from its own Species into any other 
kind of Tree. Which can be owing 
to no other Cause than the original 
Stamina latent in its Seed; which not 
only separate, but conduct the Parti-
cles proper for its Nourishment, each 
|P_6
to its proper Place in a manner pecu-
liar to itself, thereby distinguishing 
it from all other Vegetables of what 
kind soever. But a Branch once lop-
ped off can no more be restored by 
the Gardener's Art, than an amputa-
ted Limb by the Surgeon's: 'Tis true, 
indeed, new Buds may be thrust forth 
by the redundant Nourishment, both 
in the adjacent and more remote Parts, 
to compensate in some measure 
this Defect: but whether this Mutila-
tion of the Plant be of its Summit, or 
of a lateral Branch, the Extremity 
must shrivel and dry up, and will bud 
and blossom no more. 

If therefore mere Matter, altho' 
supposed to be in Motion, must be 
thus conducted by the Vessels of an 
|P_7
Animal, it must be conducted by the 
Animal itself, no Application of dif-
ferent Forces ab extra to the Vessels 
(was there any such thing, as it is evi-
dent from the Structure of the Uterus, 
there is not) being capable of regula-
ting and directing such an innumera-
ble Variety of Motions, or indeed of 
contributing to its Operations, any 
farther than supplying it with a pro-
per Nidus, and furnishing it with 
Materials ready prepared for the Pur-
pose, as sufficiently appears, not only 
from the Observations of the accurate 
Malpighi, Bellini, Redi, Merian and 
others, but discovers itself to our Sen-
ses, in the Generation of innumerable 
other Species of Animals, some depo-
siting their Eggs on Vegetables, or in 
the Earth, to be brought to Light by 
|P_8
the genial Warmth of the Sun, others 
in Dunghills, and other putrefying 
Substances, and others in Streams of 
Water, where it is impossible for any 
such Force to be applied. 

Hence then Nutrition must consist 
not only in the mere Distension, but 
in the Apposition of new Particles 
into such Parts of the Animal Body, 
as by the Enlargement of the Pores, 
and Vacuities in the Solids, are fitted 
to receive them, as I have elsewhere 
shewn by Experiment [/2./]: And, in-
deed, was it otherwise, the Animal 
would have a Power of making its 
own Fibres and Vessels, and conse-
quently of producing itself; nay the 
|P_9
Circulation of the Fluids must be per-
formed in Vessels, before the Vessels 
themselves, thro' which it is to be 
conveyed, have a Being; which are 
such Absurdities, as I shall not give 
myself the Trouble of confuting. 

That these new Particles by adhe-
ring firmly to the original Stamina in-
crease the Bulk of the Animal, till 
such time as it arrives at the Perfec-
tion its Structure is capable of, needs 
no Proof; but that the Strength of 
the original Animal owes its gradual 
Improvement to the same Cause, is 
likewise evident from the common 
Practice of several of our mechanic 
Workmen, who by steeping and satu-
rating porous Woods, or the like light 
and brittle Substances in glutinous 
|P_10
Decoctions, vastly increase their na-
tural Strength, without any Addition 
to their external Bulk, which would 
be still farther increased, was that also 
enlarged by a regular Distension of 
Parts, as in the Case of Animal Bodies. 

Hence then it will follow, that 
these adventitious Particles, which by 
their Cohesion with the original Sta-
mina, increase the Bulk and Strength 
of the Body, and thereby enable it to 
perform the proper Offices, for which 
it was created, are not really any Part 
of the Body itself, but extraneous to 
it, actuated and regulated intirely by 
it, and consequently contribute no 
farther to its exercising the Powers, 
it is designed to exert when perfect, 
than would be performed by a strong 
|P_11
Lever acting with such a Power, as 
would be impossible for a weak one 
to sustain, tho' in all other Respects 
the Case might be exactly parallel. 

Nor is this less true with regard 
to the Sensations, than Strength of 
the Body. A proper Tension in the 
nervous Fibres being as requisite in 
this Case, as Strength in those design-
ed for Muscular Motion, as appears 
from the pernicious Effects of too great 
Laxity, as well as Rigidity, in several 
Diseases, the one rendering the Sen-
sations so languid and slow thro' their 
weak Vibrations, as not to affect the 
Animal with sufficient Force and Vi-
vacity; whilst the other, thro' too 
great Stiffness and Inflexibility, scarce 
allows them to vibrate at all, as is the 
|P_12
Case in old Age; or lastly by being 
too springy and elastic, and thence 
exciting too strong and frequent Vi-
brations in such as are younger, ei-
ther renders their Sensations painful 
and uneasy, or so quick in their Suc-
cessions to each other, as to prove 
useless, nay often prejudicial to the 
Animal, as is the Case in Phrensies, 
Maniacal Persons, and the like. 

How far the Strength of the Body 
depends upon the adventitious Parti-
cles derived to it by Nutrition has 
been explained above, and it is hence 
no less evident, that they cannot pos-
sibly contribute farther to its Sensa-
tions, than as they add such a Degree 
of Firmness, as may prevent any ex-
ternal Species from acting upon the 
|P_13
nervous Fibrils so forcibly, as to in-
jure them; whilst at the same time 
by their intimate Adhesion with the 
original sensitive Organs, they cannot 
act upon the one, without exciting a 
proper Degree of Motion in the other; 
and consequently the real Sensitive 
Part of an Animal can contain no 
greater Quantity of Matter, than is 
included in the Nervous Parts of the 
Animalcule. 

This then being the State of an 
Animal when arrived at its Perfection, 
how amazing must it be to consider, 
how small and weak Organs do really 
actuate the whole Machine! But that 
this may more fully appear, and also 
afford us some determinate Idea of 
their extream Tenuity, I shall endea-
|P_14
vour to reduce such Microscopical Ob-
servations as are of best Credit to a cer-
tain Standard; that by comparing 
them with each other, and reducing 
them to Numbers, our Notions of them 
may not be altogether so vague and 
indeterminate as at present they are. 

Leeuwenhoek, that curious and di-
ligent Inquirer into those Works of 
Nature, which till his Time had by 
their Minuteness escaped all Discove-
ry, has by his repeated Microscopical 
Observations on the Semen Masculi-
num of Animals, not only shewn, that 
it abounds with Animalcula proper 
to each Species, but that, according 
to his Judgment, a thousand of them 
would scarce be equal in Thickness 
|P_15
to a Grain of Sand [/3./]; and conse-
quently that a cubical Inch would 
contain a thousand Millions of Mil-
lions of these little Beings. Professor 
Keil indeed, in his elegant Inquiry 
into the actual Divisibility of the 
Particles of Matter, has from a 
Principle of Dioptrics computed 
their Magnitude to be somewhat 
greater than that just now mention-
ed; but he has however demon-
strably shewn, that the Length of 
a single Animalculum cannot possi-
bly exceed the 3/100000th Part of an 
Inch [/4./]. That our present Enquiry 
may therefore be wholly confined 
within the Limits of Truth, rather 
than proceed upon probable Conjec-
|P_16
ture, we will make Choice of this 
latter Estimate, and for the further 
Conveniency of Calculation, take it 
for granted, that when the Foot is 
decimally divided, even such a Cubi-
cal Inch will exceed the Bulk of a 
single Animalculum, in no greater a 
Proportion, than that of a thousand 
Millions of Millions to 27. 

Now the specific Weight of the 
various Parts of an Animal Body re-
duced to a Medium amounts to a lit-
tle more than the Weight of an equal 
Bulk of Water; if therefore we suppose 
one of these Animalcula to be to Wa-
ter, as the other Parts of young Ani-
mals are, (and greater it cannot be, 
as appears from what I have elsewhere 
demonstrated with relation to the in-
|P_17
creased specific Gravity in the Arte-
ries of aged Animals [/5./], it follows, 
that as a Cubical Inch of Water is 
equivalent to 0.5271 parts of an 
Ounce Troy, the Weight of a single 
Animalcule will be equal to the 
1/140391450739th part of a Grain nearly. 

But by the Experiments of the in-
genious Dr. Keil it appears, that in a 
Man of 12 Stone-weight, the Fluids 
are to the Solids when taken at a Me-
dium, at the least in the Proportion 
of 8 to 3 [/6./], exclusive of those, which 
by the Help of Fire and a Chymical 
Process may be extracted without the 
Destruction of a single Fibre, which 
amounts to no small Quantity. It has 
|P_18
also been farther shewn by Experi-
ment, that the Vessels in young Ani-
mals bear a much less Proportion to 
their Cavities, than the like Vessels 
in old ones of the same Species bear 
to theirs [/7./]; consequently, since the 
Density of any Body is as the Weight 
of the Body directly, and its Magni-
tude inversely, we shall find, by com-
paring the foregoing Proportions of 
the Fluids and Solids together in each 
different State of the Animal, as well 
before its Birth, as after it has arrived 
at full Maturity, that all the Stamina, 
from which so noble a Being as Man 
himself was at first derived, could not 
contain so much solid Matter as would 
be equal in Bulk, to that of a Quan-
tity of Water, of no greater a Weight 
|P_19
than the 1/92408129934910602442073752000th 
part of a Grain. 

If the preceding Exility of the 
Solids in general be so surpizingly 
small, That of the Sensitive Parts 
alone, could their Relation to the rest 
be once adjusted, would doubtless, to 
speak in the Language of the Mathe-
maticians, appear a mere Infinitesimal. 
For even Leeuwenhoek has declared in 
express Words, that "Hæ Cerebri 
Fibrillæ, tenuibus puto amiciuntur 
Membranulis, quæ ob insignem 
Exilitatem nunquam sese nuda-
bunt conspectui nostro: Quod nisi 
statuamus, quo pacto Fibrillarum 
Disparationem vel Distinctionem 
Oculis assequeremur?[/8./]" To 
|P_20
which he might have added our Intel-
lectual Faculties also, it being scarce 
possible to conceive Fibres always 
growing and encreasing in Bulk, 
should be kept separate, and perform 
their various Operations, but must 
soon prove immoveable, without be-
ing divided from each other by these 
slender Partitions. 

This is not only evident from the 
Nature of the Fibres, but demonstra-
ble from Fact in the larger Parts even 
of full-grown Animals; which, when 
contiguous and deprived of their 
proper Integuments, never fail to ad-
here and unite firmly to each other, 
as is sufficiently known to the Prac-
titioners in Surgery. How much 
sooner then would this Adhæsion be 
|P_21
produced in growing Animals, where 
the Fibres are not only more supple, 
and thence more easily united, but if 
deprived of these Membranes, would 
daily as they increase in Bulk, press 
more strongly against each other? 

The Writers in Geometry have laid 
it down as an established Maxim, 
that ubicunque deficit Modulus, in 
æternum latebit Mensura; on which 
account, tho' we may rest satisfied, 
that the Subtility of the sensitive 
Parts in an Animal Body must neces-
sarily so far surpass the Extent of hu-
man Abilities, as to put their Bulk 
beyond a Possibility of being ever de-
termined to a Mathematical Exact-
ness; yet even the Nerves themselves, 
those delicate Instruments of all our 
|P_22
Knowledge, may be brought under 
such an Examination, as to afford us 
a much clearer Idea of their exqui-
site Minuteness, than what can be 
obtained from those conjectural De-
scriptions, the Anatomists have hi-
therto given us concerning it. 

For it is evident, that all the Mem-
branes of an Animal Body have Mus-
cular Fibres, and that even the great-
est Number of them are principally 
made up of such; consequently we 
could not err very far from the Truth, 
were we to estimate the Bulk of the 
Membranous Fibres in the same Pro-
portion with the Muscular ones. But 
we shall examine the Bulk and Pro-
portion they bear to each other a lit-
tle more distinctly. 

|P_23
Now Leeuwenhoek in his Observa-
tions on the Muscular Fibres has 
shewn, that some of them were equal 
to the 1/9th, others to the 1/16th part of a 
Hair [/9./]; consequently supposing each 
Fibre to be the Length of a Decimal 
Inch, there will be contained in such 
a Cubic Inch seven Millions two 
hundred ninety thousand of the for-
mer, and twenty-three Millions forty 
thousand of the latter Kind. But 
these Muscular Fibres are by later 
Observations found to be really small 
Muscles, consisting of Parts similar 
to the large one, which they consti-
tute, and terminating in Tendons 
after the same Manner as the former; 
and consequently the Fibres, of which 
|P_24
the more lax and cavernous Parts of 
the Muscle are composed, must be 
much smaller than the muscular Fi-
bres rendered visible by his Glasses. 
Whether these be the same individual 
Fibres, which constitute the Tendon, 
by being more closely compacted in 
their Parts, I shall not undertake to 
determine; but this we learn from 
the forecited Author, that a hundred 
of these exceed not the Bulk of a 
Hair [/10./], and consequently nine hun-
dred Millions of them will be con-
tained in the forementioned Cubic 
Inch. 

But these are far from being the 
smallest Fibres in the Body. For 
that the pellucid Membranes consist 
|P_25
of Fibres of still smaller Dimensions, 
decreasing probably to the 1/300th part 
of a Hair, or upwards, is evident from 
the Structure of those fine Capillary 
Arteries, which are destined to con-
vey a Fluid to them. For the whole 
Diameter of such an extream Artery 
does not exceed the 1/1620th part of an 
Inch [/11./] that is, the 1/5th of a Hair 
nearly, and yet the Coat of this Ves-
sel is made up of at least three distinct 
Species of Membranes, each of them 
furnished with Vessels peculiar to it-
self. And farther, if we consider, 
that the transverse Section of every 
Vessel is of a circular Form, we must 
necessarily allow, that the Longitudi-
nal Fibres must be much smaller than 
any of those abovementioned; other-
|P_26
instead of a Circle, a Polygon 
would be produced, as is evident from 
Geometry. 

Now even these are bulky Sub-
stances, when compared with the 
nervous Fibrils destined to Sensation, 
as appears from those which form 
the Retina. For these Fibres were 
manifestly before their Expansion into 
this Membrane collected within the 
Bulk of what is styled by Anatomists 
the Optic Nerve, and are, as the in-
genious Professor Monro assures us, 
so extreamly small, that it is demon-
strable, they cannot exceed the Thick-
ness of the 1{divisor}32400th part of a Hair [/12./]. 
If therefore we reject the odd four 
hundred in the foregoing Fraction, 
|P_27
and suppose, that no more than 32000 
of these Nervous Fibrils are necessary 
to make up a Thickness equal to that 
abovementioned, and also set the 
Muscular, Tendinous, and Membra-
nous Fibres to be at a Medium, of 
no greater a Thickness than the 1/200th 
Part of a Hair, (which, from what 
has been just now explained above, 
is apparently a very large Allowance 
with respect to the Subtility of the 
Fibres in general) it will then follow, 
that the Thickness of one of these 
Fibrils in the Retina will be to that 
of such Fibres, as constitute the other 
Membranes and Organs of the Body, 
in the proportion of 1 to 160. But 
we have already shewn, that all the Sta-
mina in an Animalcule could not con-
tain so much solid Matter, as is equal 
|P_28
in Bulk to a Particle of Water weigh-
ing the 1/92408129934910602442073752000th 
part of a Grain; consequently, if we 
suppose, that a Nervous Fibril does 
accompany every individual Fibre in 
the Animal System, and compare 
the Proportions they bear to each 
other as given above, we shall find, 
that the whole sensitive Parts in the 
Animalcule taken together could not 
amount to a greater Bulk than that 
of the 1/3764060396563654679984851840619241th 
part of a cubical Inch, or that all the 
solid Matter of the Nerves, by which 
the Sensations in the human System 
are actually communicated to the 
Mind, cannot possibly weigh the 1/14877708919520606993173874072000th part of 
a Grain. 

|P_29
That the stupendous Expansion 
and Action of the Fibres and Vessels 
of an Animalcule up to that of a 
full grown Man should be owing to 
an Entity like this, a mere fluxionary 
Increment with respect to Quantity 
and Magnitude, will, I doubt not, to 
many appear impossible, to all incom-
prehensible; but are not all other of 
the Creator's Works equally so? Or 
is this more than infinite Power act-
ing on Matter infinitely divisible is 
capable of, whose Particles must be 
still higher subtilised, and spun into 
Fibres inconceivably more minute in 
the Bodies of Insects, than is here spe-
cified of the human, as they are all 
furnished with Arteries, Veins, Nerves, 
Muscles, Bones, and Tendons suitable 
|P_30
to their various Structures, and Man-
ner of subsisting. 

The incomparable Mr. Locke,
speaking of the Identity of the same 
Person, resolves it wholly into its Con-
sciousness, even though the whole 
Substance, material or immaterial, 
should be intirely changed. Many 
Physicians have also been of opinion, 
and some even laid it down as a 
Maxim, that the whole Substance of 
the Body, during the Length of an 
ordinary Life, is several times so in-
tirely changed, as to consist wholly 
of new Particles, of the same Nature 
and Kind as the preceeding. How 
far these Opinions may agree with 
what is taught by Divine Revelation, 
where this very Sameness, in its 
|P_31
strictest Acceptation, seems to be ex-
pressly declared, is not my province 
to determine. But this we may 
plainly deduce from what has been 
premised, that the whole Substance 
of the Body, except these original 
Stamina of the Animalcule, may be 
many times changed, and yet the real 
Body continue the same, and be pos-
sessed of the same personal Identity, 
with regard both to Body and Mind, 
at the End of the longest Life, as it 
was at the instant of its Birth; nay 
even in the Animalcule itself. 

That these original Stamina should 
all remain unhurt, and fit to perform 
their several Functions to the End of 
Life, is a Position not to be admitted; 
but that without a competent Num-
|P_32
ber of them so remaining, the Animal 
will decline both in its vital and in-
tellectual Faculties, notwithstanding 
the Body be replenished with a suf-
ficient Number of homogeneous Par-
ticles to supply the Place of such Parts 
as are abraded and worn away, or 
otherwise hindered from performing 
their natural Functions, seems equally 
certain; both from the Decay of our 
intellectual Faculties, and the gradual 
Loss of Vigour in the Body, even 
whilst the Force of the vital Organs 
seems no ways impaired. Conse-
quently something more must be ne-
cessary, than the mere Application of 
homogeneous Matter to supply this 
Demand. But that can be no other, 
than that particular Texture, with 
which they were originally formed, 
|P_33
and by which they become capable 
of transmitting the Effects of exter-
nal Agents to the Mind. 

It may possibly be objected, that 
all Matter being equally incapable of 
Sensation, no Reason can possibly be 
assigned, why such homogeneous 
Matter, as supplies the constant Loss, 
the Body sustains by the Attrition of 
its Parts on each other, and serves for 
its Accretion, Strength, and Nutri-
tion, may not be equally capable of 
conveying our Sensations to the Mind, 
as the original Stamina above men-
tioned. But if we may reason from 
what ensues in the larger Parts, which 
are compounded of these very Sta-
mina, upon their being wounded, or 
broken with Loss of Substance, 'tis 
|P_34
evident, that though by the Addi-
tion of homogeneous Matter to the 
different Species of Vessels, the Body 
to Appearance, may have received no 
great Detriment, and be sufficient 
for the principal Purposes of Life; 
yet are such Parts of very dull and ob-
scure Sensation, if they may be said 
to enjoy it in any other manner, than 
by their Union with the original Sta-
mina. So that could we suppose these 
Stamina quite destroyed, and the Body 
so far changed, as to consist only of 
such homogeneous Matter, though 
with Vessels in Form and Bulk simi-
lar to the former, yet these united by 
a Texture different from that of the 
original Fibres; 'tis evident from 
what ensues upon a like Change in 
the Fibres constituting the larger 
|P_35
Parts, that such a Person, if he had 
either Sensitive or Intellectual Facul-
ties at all, must have them in a man-
ner vastly different from those of the 
former. And consequently this Same-
ness or Identity must remain in a great 
Measure fixed and unalterable in the 
Body from its Birth to its Dissolution. 

Nor is this Difference in the ori-
ginal Stamina confined in its Effects 
to the fibrous Parts of the Body only, 
but communicates them to the circu-
lating Juices themselves, distinguish-
ing thereby the different Kinds of 
Flesh of each Species of Animals from 
each other, even where they are su-
stained by the same Kind of Food. 
Otherwise it would happen in Cases 
of this Kind, that the Taste, Com-
|P_36
plexion, Odour, and Cohesion of the 
Flesh would of Necessity be nearly 
the same in all. 

The same would be the Conse-
quence with regard to the Glands of 
the same Body, which would sepa-
rate nearly the same Kind of Juice, 
and consequently be useless, or per-
haps prejudicial, was it not prevented 
by the different Structure both of the 
Strainer itself, and the Preparatory 
Vessels. For howsoever we may 
imagine the Juice to be separated 
from the circulating Mass, we cannot 
with any Colour of Reason suppose 
such a various and exquisite Contri-
vance, as is discovered not only in the 
Formation of the Gland itself, but 
also in that of the Vessels leading to 
|P_37
and from it, so widely differing 
among themselves in their Structure, 
Texture, and Capacity [/13./], should 
ever be designed only to perform 
what any one Species of them was 
capable of. 

Hence then it must follow, that 
the principal Differences in Animal 
Bodies are owing to the different 
Structure of the original Stamina, 
with regard not only to their exterior 
Shape and Actions, but that even the 
Fluids themselves, and that solid 
Part called the Flesh, derive their 
chief and principal Difference from 
this Source; and consequently, that 
there is a real Identity of Animal 
|P_38
Bodies incommunicable to any other, 
depending on this very Cause. 

Nor is this relating to the Fluids 
a mere Conjecture, but a real Fact, 
as appears from those morbid Cases, 
where either the Glands, Preparatory 
Vessels, or even the fleshy Parts are 
vitiated and depraved; which never 
fail to separate unnatural Juices, tho' 
derived from the most healthful Blood. 

Analogous to this we see in the 
Vegetable World, that it is not the 
Root, or even Trunk of the Tree, 
tho' all the Juices are thereby sup-
plied, but the Bud or Scion only, 
which governs the whole, and pro-
duces the Species of Blossoms and 
|P_39
Fruit peculiar to itself. In like 
manner the Vessels of the Animalcule, 
of what Species soever it be, convert 
the Juices designed for its Nourish-
ment, each, into such as are suitable 
to their different Structures; and 
thence keep up an infinite Variety in 
Animals, tho' supplied by the same 
kind of Food, according to the dif-
ferent Vessels by whose means it is 
elaborated and perfected, being in 
some highly volatilised and attenuat-
ed, which gives the high Taste; in 
others more viscous and inactive, 
which produces the opposite, and 
are therefore less pleasing to a volup-
tuous Appetite. 

I am not here supposing, that the 
Qualities of the circulating Juices of 
|P_40
Animals depend so intirely upon the 
Structure of the Solids, that the Di-
versity of Food is herein of no Con-
sequence, daily Experience sufficiently 
confuting so absurd an Opinion. But 
only that in those of a different Spe-
cies, the Taste, Odour, and other 
Qualities of their Juices, are princi-
pally owing to this different Struc-
ture; as is manifest from hence, viz.
that the Qualities of the Juices of 
differing Animals, though sustained 
with the same Kind of Food, are 
more dissonant to each other, than 
are those of the same Species, though 
sustained with Food of a very differ-
ent Nature; and consequently, this 
Identity in the various Species of 
Animals, must principally consist in 
the Structure of the Solids, or, in 
|P_41
other Words, in the original Stamina 
of each individual Species. 

Thus has our Reasoning at length 
led us to the Discovery and Demon-
stration of a Truth, which at first 
Sight must appear beyond all Proba-
bility, and we can now with Cer-
tainty affirm, that from so simple a 
Cause as the different Modification 
of the same Matter, the wise Author 
of Nature has produced not only one 
kind of Flesh of Men, another of 
Beasts, another of Fishes, and another 
of Birds; but these also infinitely dif-
ferent in the different Species of 
each. 

Hence we may see, why some Ani-
mals shall necessarily require such a 
|P_42
Degree of Warmth, to preserve their 
Juices sufficiently exalted and attenu-
ated for their comfortable Subsistence, 
as others cannot sustain without Pre-
judice, even scarcely without a Dis-
solution; and vice versa, why such 
a Degree of Cold, as is only agree-
able, or perhaps necessary to the 
Health of these, should prove so far 
destructive of others, as on the least 
Condensation of the Fluids from that 
Cause, to render them torpid, mo-
tionless, and seemingly dead, till re-
stored by the kindly Influence of the 
approaching Summer. 

Hence also it is obvious, why the 
Blood and Juices of some particular 
Species of Animals shall be affected 
with Diseases of a Pestilential Nature 
|P_43
with regard to them, from such 
Causes, as shall produce very few In-
conveniences to many other Kinds. 

Hence also we may see the Reason, 
why each individual Person has some 
Particularities in his Constitution pe-
culiar to himself, not to be found in 
the Generality of the Species, nor de-
pending on his Manner of Life, by 
which he is as it were distinguished 
from the rest: Which also probably 
may sometimes be the Case in Brutes, 
tho' more rarely than in Men, could 
we equally arrive at the Knowledge 
of it, as is manifest from the different 
Sprightliness, Vigour, and Activity 
of some compared with others of the 
same Species. 

|P_44
Lastly, hence we may see, why 
an intire Change of the Constitution 
should be attended with almost insu-
perable Difficulties: Why great Al-
terations require a long and gradual 
Process, nor are to be attempted by 
hasty Methods, lest the Patient, in-
stead of Relief, meet with certain 
Ruin and Destruction. 

FINIS.
