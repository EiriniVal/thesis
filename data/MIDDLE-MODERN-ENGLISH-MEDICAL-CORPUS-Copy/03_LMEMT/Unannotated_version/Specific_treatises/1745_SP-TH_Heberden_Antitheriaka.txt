[}AN 
ESSAY 
ON 
MITHRIDATIUM, &c. }]
MITHRIDATES, the famous King of 
Pontus, had a strange affectation of superior 
skill in the powers of Simples. His Courtiers, 
we may imagine, flattered him upon it, and he 
has accordingly been delivered down to us as a 
second Solomon. Whereas if we consider the little 
leisure, that he had for his own enquiries into 
this part of nature; or the little helps, that he 
could have from the people about him; we must 
conclude that his knowledge was very inconsi- 
derable. However, Pompey seems to have been 
possessed with the vulgar opinion, and, after he 
had conquered this King, took uncommon care to 
secure his writings, in hopes of some mighty 
treasures of natural knowledge. He was soon con- 
vinced of what he might easily have foreseen, 
and is represented as laughing at the disappoint- 
ment of his own credulity, when, instead of those 
|P_2
great arcana, he only found one or two trifling 
receipts. [/1./]

There were probably some artful people at 
this time, who were not disposed to part so easily 
with the great expectations that had been raised, 
nor to lose this fair opportunity of enriching them- 
selves by a plausible imposture: which has since, 
been several times repeated and is frequently 
practiced amongst us at this day. For soon after, 
there was published in Rome a most pompous 
medicine with the name of Antidotum Mithrida- 
tium, which was pretended to have been found 
among his papers: though Plutarch[/2./] who 
gives a minute detail of them (mentioning the 
Love-letters and several interpretations of Dreams) 
says not one word of this famous medicine; 
which one can hardly think that he would have 
omitted, if he had found the tradition supported 
by any proper testimonies. The authority of 
Q. Serenus Samonieus is more positive, who says 
that, notwithstanding the many receipts of Mi- 
thridatium that were handed about, the true me- 
dicine found in the cabinet of Mithridates, was 
only that trivial one consisting of twenty leaves 
of rue, one grain of salt, two nuts, and two dried 
sigs. [/3./] So that there is some reason to suspect 
|P_3
that Mithridates was as much a stranger to his 
own antidote, as several eminent Physicians have 
since been to the medicines that are daily adver- 
tised under their names. 

The Publishers were not content with father- 
ing this composition upon so great a name, but 
were likewise very extravagant in their com- 
mendations of it's virtues: The principal of which 
was made to consist in it's being a most powerful 
preservative from all kinds of venom. Whoever 
took a proper quantity in a morning, was insured 
from being poisoned during that whole day. [/4./]
This was confirmed by the example [/5./] of it's sup- 
posed Inventor; who was farther said, by using 
it in this manner, to have been at last so forti- 
fied against all baneful Simples, that none would 
have any effect, when he wanted their assistance 
to dispatch himself. [/6./]

By these arts it gained so great a reputation, 
that some of the Roman Emperors prepared it 
for themselves with their own hands; several 
Physicians among the Antients employed their 
studies upon it in order to render it more perfect; 
and it has been the subject of many volumes, as 
well as the occasion of many unaccountable 
medicines made in emulation of it, among the 
|P_4
Moderns. In particular, Andromachus, who was 
physician to Nero, made considerable alterations 
in it; among other things leaving out the Scink, 
adding Vipers, and increasing the proportion of 
Opium. He likewise changed the name of the 
Mithridatium thus reformed to Γαλήνη, but in 
Trajan's time it obtained that of Theriaca, either 
from the Vipers in it, or from it's good effects 
in curing the bites of venomous beasts; [/7./] and by 
this name it is known and used at this day. But, 
notwithstanding this happy improvement by 
Andromachus, the original Mithridatium has all 
along been continued as well as this reformation 
of it, and is still prepared by our Apothecaries 
according to a receipt of Damocrates in Greek 
Iambics, which has been preserved by Galen. 

Now whether Mithridates was or was not the 
author of this celebrated composition, it was 
manifestly founded in error, since it was chiefly 
intended as a counterpoison: for nothing can be 
more false than the notions which have generally 
prevailed about the force and number of Poisons, 
and consequently of Antidotes. 

In the ruder ages of the world, before experi- 
ence had furnished mankind with any considerable 
knowledge of nature, they seem to have been under 
perpetual alarms from an apprehension of poisons: 
They had probably seen the ill effect of some 
|P_5
few substances on the human body, and, like peo- 
ple in the dark, immediately made their dangers 
more and greater than they were; hence came 
that great number of Antidotes, which we meet 
with in the writings of the old Physicians, 
whose chief use was against poisons. [/8./] What ig- 
norance or an immoderate fondness for life had 
thus begun, was carried to a much greater height 
by that strong passion which the Vulgar have ever 
shewn for prodigies and miraculous stories. This 
was a sufficient warrant for Poets and other dealers 
in siction to make a plentiful use of poisons upon 
all occasions; by which the original error has 
been much confirmed and improved. Not to 
mention any thing of the suspicions which have 
attended Mothers-in-law, immediate Successors 
and other persons interested in the deaths of such 
as were taken off with any unusual symptoms. 
Politicians seem likewise to have given authority 
to these groundless suppositions, by laying the 
the deaths of many, whom they dispatched, upon 
poisons which the parties themselves, as was given 
out, always carried about with them and had 
secretly taken; by this contrivance the matter 
was hushed up and all the odium of the murder 
avoided. The death of Demosthenes was, I think, 
of this sort; who was probably killed by some 
trusty Assassin that Antipater's party sent into 
|P_6
the temple to him, but it was too unpopular an 
action among the Athenians to be openly avowed. 
This, though not hitherto suspected that I know 
of, appears not unlikely from the variety of ac- 
counts about his poisoning himself, and because 
there was no poison then known that could effect 
it according to any of these accounts. The same 
perhaps may be said of Hannibal and of several 
others. By all these means the number and fame 
of reputed poisons has been perpetually increasing; 
and Antidotes have increased in proportion; for 
if a person did not dye who had taken an inef- 
fectual poison, it was of course attributed to the 
virtue of some insignificant Antidote. After all 
these rumours of poisons and tragical relations of 
their effects in all histories, it is surprizing to find 
that the Antients knew of none except the Cicuta, 
Aconitum, and those of venomous beasts; [/9./] and 
knew of no antidote whatever to these poisons. 
The many intrigues mentioned in antient history 
to have been carried on by means of others and 
far more subtil ones, especially in the Persian 
court, will at once come into my learned Reader's 
mind in prejudice of my assertion. To obviate 
which I only desire him to consider that all the 
old Naturalists and Physicians, though some of 
them professedly treat of poisons, appear to have 
known no real ones but those abovementioned: 
|P_7
their catalogue is indeed much larger by having 
in it, Quicksilver, Orpiment, Bull's Blood, Dia- 
monds with many other innocent things: And 
is it possible that Women and Eunuchs shut up 
in an eastern palace should have a greater insight 
into the powers of nature, than those Philosophers 
who spent their whole lives and travelled the 
known world over in quest of natural knowledge? 
Indeed the common stories have all the marks of 
forgery and falshood; in particular, it is pleasant 
to observe how these fantoms have fled before the 
approach of light and learning. The first account 
of subtil poisons that might be concealed under 
the stone of a seal or ring began in Greece; and 
Theophrastus mentions a sort of them that might 
be proportioned so as to exert their effects after 
any given time. [/10./] When this story could no longer 
maintain its ground in Europe, it took sanctuary 
in Africa, for in A. Gellius's time [/11./] such an one 
was reported to have been given there to Regulus, 
before they permitted his going to Rome, that, 
whatever happened, they might be sure of de- 
stroying him. From Africa it fled into Asia
among the Turks, who, as Matthiolus[/12./] suspected, 
were in possession of these fatal secrets. It has 
been driven from the Turks into the remotest 
|P_8
Eaft-Indies, [/13./] and upon our coming nearer these 
countries by an established commerce, this ignis 
fatuus retreated into the West-Indies, the first 
accounts [/14./] of which give us the old story with 
all the pretended airs of truth and novelty, as if it 
had not been long before exploded out of every 
other part of the World. I would not be under- 
stood to deny the possibility of poisoning by such 
very small quantities, by the vapors arising from 
perfumed gloves and letters, or that a poison may 
lye concealed in the blood for a considerable time 
before it exerts itself. It is plain that there are 
such things in nature, from the terrible effects of 
that very little liquor instilled by the bite of a 
viper; from the vapors of charcoal; and the poison 
of a mad-dog lurking, as some say, for twenty 
years: however the gout and leprosy and madness 
will certainly lye in the blood unactive for a 
whole generation. But I think I may venture to 
assert, there never was any thing yet discovered 
that we can apply with such effects. Now if this 
is a true account of the state of poisons among 
the Antients, what are we to think of their 
Antidotes? Would it not be as strange to make 
use of them, as of the charms and amulets which 
are delivered down to us as preservatives from 
|P_9
witchcraft, an evil eye, or the power of any 
malicious Demons? 

What has here been said may be objected to 
every single alexipharmac drug: but much more 
may be said against them when united together 
as in the Mithridatium; which has by many 
been called a piece of mere jumble and chance- 
work without any footsteps of order, proportion 
or design, without any regard to the known 
virtues of Simples or to any rules of artful com- 
position. I forbear to mention the unreasonable 
number of ingredients, their contradictory effects 
even according to the Antients themselves, the 
inconsiderable portion of many of them in the 
quantity of a dose, with several other particulars 
of the same kind that have been so often objected 
to it. The most zealous patron that ever defended 
it will hardly assert that it's Inventor had such an 
insight into the powers of the Materia medica, as 
to see any reason a priori for the number and pro- 
portions that he has used: Experience alone can 
be called in to vouch for it's character, and no 
better voucher can be desired; but experience is 
clearly against it; this once all-powerful medicine 
that resisted every poison and malignant disease, 
that procured long life, quickness of senses, sta- 
bility of health, that not only cured present but 
prevented future diseases, (all which and much 
|P_10
more is affirmed of the reformed Mithridate or 
Theriaca by Galen[/15./]) is at present scarce ever 
made use of for any of these purposes; but desti- 
tute of all it's celebrated virtues is forced to take 
refuge in that of a Diaphoretic, which is com- 
monly the virtue of a medicine that has none. 
And there cannot surely be a stronger proof of 
any medicine's insignificancy, than it's losing 
ground so remarkably after a tryal of near two 
thousand years with a constant prepossession in 
it's favour. We have no particular accounts of 
any service that it ever did; but we are told that 
the constant use of it hurt that excellent Emperor 
Antoninus by throwing him into a lethargic dis- 
order: [/16./] and it did Mithridates no good, sup- 
posing that he ever knew and used it; for his not 
being able to dispatch himself was probably less 
owing to the strength of his antidote than to the 
weakness of his poison. In particular it's antidote 
virtue is utterly lost; we know of many more 
poisons than the Antients, yet there is not one 
which the Mithridate will at all counteract any 
farther than plain Opium will do it: Whoever 
was to depend upon it would infallibly meet with 
the fate of that unfortunate Quack mentioned 
by Wepfer[/17./] who offered to sale a medicine made 
|P_11
upon the plan of the old Antidotes, that was to 
secure people from all poisons: he was rash 
enough to make the experiment upon himself 
by taking Arsenic, and soon died, notwithstand- 
ing his Antidote, in a miserable manner. But if 
we are forced to give up the original alexipharmac 
virtue, there is a strong presumption against it's 
being good for any thing else; for if medicines 
so elaborately contrived will not answer their first 
purpose, it is a great chance if they can be applied 
to any other for which they were not intended, 
without having great defects and superfluities in 
this new application. 

But let us even suppose that undesigning chance 
did hit upon a mixture, for which experience 
has found out uses in as full a manner as the 
Antients ever pretended; yet what foundation 
will this be to us for expecting the like advantages? 
What if Fortune has for once out of a medley 
of inconsistent drugs produced an useful medicine, 
can we therefore hope that any other fortuitous 
concourse of them will have the same effect? 
But this we must hope, if we have any confidence 
in what is at present called Mithridatium or 
Theriaca. For I believe that it has scarce ever 
continued the same for a hundred years together. 
Celsus is the first that describes this medicine, and 
in him it consists of thirty eight Simples. Before 
|P_12
Nero's time, five of these were struck out, and 
twenty others added. Soon after, Andromachus
leaving out six and adding twenty-eight ingredi- 
ents, increased the sum total to seventy-five, 
Aëtius in the Vth Century and Myrepsus in the 
XIIth give us very different descriptions of Mithri- 
datium: and since that time it has been in a state 
of perpetual fluctuation; the alterations, that it 
has undergone by accident, being as great as those 
that have been designedly made in it. For of the 
Simples that antiently composed it, several are 
utterly unknown, [/18./] others only guessed at with 
great uncertainty, and some very erroneously, as 
easily be shewn, and were so even in 
Pliny's [/19./] time. From the different substitutes 
for the unknown parts, and the various guesses 
at the uncertain parts, with the difficulty of get- 
ting many of the ingredients, being never used 
but in this composition, it happens that not only 
all the Moderns differ from the Antients, but 
almost all our shops differ from one another in 
their manner of preparing it. Many are the dis- 
putes, which have been occasioned among Phy- 
sicians, about it's true drugs. There was one 
carried so high, about a hundred years ago, con- 
|P_13
cerning Balsam of Gilead, that at last the Disputants 
appealed to the Pope; but the Pope, not chusing 
to assert his infallibility in matters of Physic, 
wisely referred the cause to Petrus Castellus, a 
learned Physician of Rome, who has published an 
account of this notable controversy. Now in cases 
where we can reason upon the effects of a 
medicine, many alterations may be made and 
yet the virtues continue the same; but as here 
we must wholly depend upon experience, how 
can any one be sure that these alterations 
have not utterly spoiled it, since no one knows 
where it's virtues lye? and [/20./]Galen has told us that 
the badness of any one ingredient will often spoil 
the whole composition. Besides, which of all the 
antient descriptions are we to take? for the 
several receipts [/21./] under the names of the elder 
and younger Andromachus, Damocrates, Crito, 
Magnus, Xenocrates and Demetrius all vary from 
one another. This objection will farther be 
strengthened by considering that even in Galen's 
time there were great faults in the copies that 
were handed about, [/22./] and if many new ones 
have not been since added, they must have had 
better fortune than any other kind of writing; 
|P_14
but the first elements of criticism will teach us 
that they are of all the most corrupt, as they con- 
sist of arbitrary marks for quantities and uncon- 
nected names of Simples, where the context is 
of no service to direct the copyists: and that this 
has happened in fact to these medicines appears 
from the various readings belonging to their de- 
scriptions in Celsus, Galen, Aëtius and Myrepsus; 
and likewise from all these authors differing from 
one another in their directions how they are to 
be prepared. 

If our objections stopped here, and these grand 
antidotes were only good for nothing; it would 
hardly be worth while to censure or take any 
notice of them: but we may justly fear that their 
use is attended with a good deal of danger. As 
many people busy themselves with the practice of 
Physic, who are unqualified to know what they 
are doing; it may be advisable, for the sake of 
such as fall into their hands, to discountenance 
a medicine, which, upon the tradition of it's 
sovereign virtues, or as a sudorific, is often applied 
at random, and, by means of the Opium, does 
much mischief. But it's use may be of ill conse- 
quence not only in the hands of the vulgar, but 
even of a skillful Physician; for Opium or any 
powerful drug, mixed up into an electuary with 
any other things, is against all rules of phar- 
|P_15
macy; the prescriber lies too much at the mercy 
of the person who mixes the ingredients, whether 
what he gives for an ordinary dose shall not con- 
tain a dangerous or fatal quantity of opium: and 
indeed it is hardly to be expected, in such a 
multiplicity of ingredients, that the usual dose 
will contain a just proportion of all of them, and 
of course the Physician will be greatly in the dark, 
whenever he prescribes it. There are not wanting 
instances of such ill effects from the Mithridatium
and Theriaca, as must have been owing to the 
patient's having more than his share of Opium. 
It is very probable that this was long ago experi- 
enced, which gave occasion to the commendations 
bestowed upon Old Theriaca; for Galen tells us [/23./]
that the use of keeping it for some time is to 
mitigate the strength of the Opium: (which, 
however, keeping will not do to any purpose [/24./]) 
another reason has been since found out, namely, 
that age resolves the several parts into one uni- 
form mass: upon these two accounts the practice 
of preferring such as has been laid up till it is 
thirty or forty years old, prevails to this day. [/25./]
This surely lies extremely open to censure; for 
would it not have been better to have put less 
|P_16
Opium in it at first? Did it enter there, only that 
it might go out again? Besides, together with the 
strength of the Opium, the virtues of the Aro- 
matics will exhale and leave the mass, if not quite 
spiritless and unactive, at least much altered from 
what it was at first. 

Lastly, this farrago is very apt to ferment; 
which fermentation, while it lasts, is said to 
exalt [/26./] the power of the Opium to a degree of 
strength three or four times as great as it had 
before; and a common dose may by these means 
be so much stronger than was intended; which 
is a danger not commonly thought of nor easily 
avoided, and cannot be balanced by any real vir- 
tues belonging to these medicines. 

Why then should we retain them any longer 
in our shops? Can we not do every thing, that 
they can reasonably pretend to, in a much art- 
fuller, safer and more simple manner? I think 
that they are now chiefly given as Opiates and 
Aromatics; which intentions would surely be 
much better answered by mixing two or three 
of our many spices, in which we so far excell 
the Antients, with as much Opium added to 
every dose as was thought proper; without load- 
ing a sick man's stomach with so many other use- 
less things, that must accompany them, when 
|P_17
given in the Mithridatium or Theriaca. I own it 
is hard to say, that these are their chief virtues, 
or what their chief virtues are; for there are as 
many friendly and hostile qualities blended to- 
gether, as in that well-known case, where the 
Poet forbids us incerta hæc ratione certa facere. 

I might now proceed to support my objections 
by authorities, which perhaps would be the pro- 
perest method of attacking what is supported only 
by authority. For I must do that justice to Phy- 
sicians as to own that there have not been want- 
ing several in all ages who have born witness against 
this complicated error, and that it's triumph has 
been constantly attended with many just censures 
and reproaches. However I shall content myself 
with quoting only the opinion of Pliny who is almost 
as old as the Theriaca, and that of a Writer of our 
own times; since if what has been said is of any 
weight, it will make it an unnecessary task to col- 
lect all that has been disputed for and against it 
by the intervening Writers. The latter of these 
Authors [/27./] asserts that Mithridatium and such 
other medicines have done more mischief in 
|P_18
the world than good: The former declaims with 
great vehemence against the injudiciousness, the 
ostentation and wantonness of this heap of Drugs. [/28./]
Both of them seem, oddly enough, to agree in 
referring the invention of it to the just judgment 
of heaven; as if the delusion was too strong 
and unaccountable to proceed from mere human 
artifice and contrivance. But notwithstanding 
what these and others have said against it, it 
still goes on to be prepared in the old manner, 
as near as may be, in all the great cities of 
Europe. It's power indeed and fame has of late 
been manifestly declining; and we may hope 
that it's reign will not last much longer. Enough 
surely has been given to Antiquity: let not 
length of time, which has ever been the fatal 
enemy of falshood and imposture, be made in 
this instance to support and protect them. Perhaps 
the glory of it's first expulsion from a public 
Dispensatory was reserved to these times and 
|P_19
to the English Nation; in which all parts of 
Philosophy have been so much assisted in asserting 
their freedom from antient fable and superstition; 
and whose College of Physicians, in particular, 
hath deservedly had the first reputation in their 
profession. Among the many eminent services, 
which the authority of this learned and judicious 
Body hath done to the practice of Physic, it might 
not be the least that it had driven out this medley 
of discordant Simples; which, perhaps, has no 
better title to the name of Mithridates, than as 
it so well resembles the numerous, undisciplined 
forces of a barbarous King, made up of a dis- 
sonant crowd collected from different countries, 
mighty in appearance, but in reality, an ineffec- 
tive multitude, that only hinder one another.
