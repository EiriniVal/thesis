[^Decorative frame around the letter "A", five lines in height.^]AT Bridgewater, So-
mersetshire, 1703. I 
was sent for to Hunt-
spill, to a Farmer's 
wife, who had been 
in Labour three days: her Pains 
were declining, and she reduced 
|P_2
to the utmost degree of Weak-
ness; not having been in Bed 
all that time, (which is the com-
mon, but very bad, practice of 
the Country Midwives.) When 
I came, I found her Spirits quite 
exhausted; and her Midwife, 
being also fatigued, was in a 
sound sleep. I laid the Woman 
on the Bed, and by Touching 
her, found the Child lay on the 
Os Pubis (or Share-bone.) The 
Waters being gone, made the 
remaining part of her Labour 
the more difficult: however, re-
lieving her Child from the Os 
Pubis, which strengthen'd her 
Pains, I deliver'd her of a Daugh-
ter alive, and that in the space 
of three hours; to the grand 
surprize of her Midwife, when 
awake, who seem'd glad the 
Child was born alive, she be-
lieving it dead the day before.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
being four days in Labour, 
and her Child very much 
Putrified. }]
I WAS sent for to Bromfield, 
to a Farmer's wife, who was 
one of my mother's Women; 
and my mother being then dead 
about three months, she had 
spoke to me: but some of her 
friends prevailed with her to 
have another Midwife. The 
reason was, I was then thought 
too young, and that an elderly 
woman would do better. But 
when I came, I found the wo-
man bolster'd upright, breathe-
|P_4
ing very short, her Nostrils 
working, and her Pulse very 
quick and irregular, as tho' Life 
was departing. 

I ask'd the Midwife, How long 
she had been in that manner? 
she told me from Thursday, and 
this was on the Monday morn-
ing following. The Woman 
said she had not felt the Child 
from Friday; and, probably, it 
might be dead longer, by the 
putrefaction of the child. I 
could not help letting the Mid-
wife, and women that were with 
her, know, That her life was 
in the utmost danger, proper 
assistance having been too long 
neglected; and it was my opi-
nion, she could not long survive. 
They desir'd me to deliver her, 
which, thanks to the Omnipo-
tent, I did, in thirty minutes, 
tho' with great difficulty; by 
|P_5
reason the child was so putrefied; 
notwithstanding which the Wo-
man did well. 

[^A rectangular decorative figure, one and a half lines in height.^]
[}Observation III. }]
[}The Delivery of a Woman in 
a violent Flooding, and her 
Child dead. }]
I WAS soon after sent for to 
Petherton, two miles from 
Bridgewater, to a Taylor's wife. 
When I came to her she was ly-
ing on the bed speechless; for 
she had flooded in so violent a 
manner, that she never stain'd 
a Cloth at, or after, her De-
livery. When I had stated her 
dangerous Case, I Touch'd her: 
the Secundine, I found, present-
ed first; but Searching further, 
|P_6
found the Waters not gone; 
wherefore having two beds in 
one room, I order'd the other 
to be ready to receive her; so 
breaking the Waters, the Child's 
head presented: but she being 
faint by the prodigious loss of 
blood, I examin'd for the Feet; 
which in searching for, I found 
the Navel-string without the 
least Pulsation; a plain demon-
stration the Child was dead. 
However, I found the Feet with 
less Difficulty than I sometimes 
have, and deliver'd her in less 
than fifteen minutes of a large 
boy, who, by all circumstances, 
had been dead about eight hours; 
which, no doubt, happen'd thro' 
her great loss of blood. As soon 
as I had deliver'd her of the 
Child and After-Birth (assisted 
by the Women) we laid her in 
the other bed. 'Twas a full 
|P_7
hour before she spoke; when 
she recover'd her spirits she de-
clar'd, she remember'd not any 
thing of her being deliver'd. 
She lived and did well: for ri-
ding that way about five weeks 
after, I called to see her, and 
found her out of danger, but 
weak, and her Legs inclin'd to 
swell, which is common in such 
cases: but this was soon remo-
ved, by taking a few doses of 
proper Physick, when capable 
of receiving it. 'Twas 5 months 
before she recover'd strength 
enough to stir abroad; tho' had 
her Midwife had judgment to 
have deliver'd her, as soon as she 
fell into such Floodings, the 
Child's life might have been 
saved, and the mother preser-
ved from extreme danger; be-
sides the expences that such 
weak Lyings-in occasion, which 
|P_8
are very chargeable to poor 
people.

[}Observation IV. }]
[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
her Child being fixed on the 
Os Pubis, or Share-bone. }]
IN a short time after I was 
sent for to Bromfield, to a 
Farmer's wife, who had been in 
Labour about eight and forty 
hours, her Midwife being all 
the time with her. She was a 
woman of very low spirits; her 
Pains were short, by reason the 
Child's head fix'd on the Os 
Pubis (or Share-bone.) I have 
observed, in all such Labours, 
the Pains are very short, and 
extreme sharp: The reason is, 
|P_9
the Pains force the Child's head 
on the Os Pubis, which proves 
injurious both to Mother and 
Child. The practice of Mid-
wives, in general, in this case, 
is to press hard on the back 
part of the body; when, indeed, 
they have not the least occasion 
to press any where; but to pass 
by, or thro' the Vagina, and 
gently feel for the Entrance or 
Mouth of the Womb; and if it 
be in a wrong situation, to place 
it right, or dilate it, as there 
is occasion: which I shall shew 
as my Observations give me 
leave. In this case, I examined 
the Matrix, and found the In-
ner Orifice lay very high to her 
Back, and open enough to ad-
mit of my Fore-finger, which 
I soon dilated to the admittance 
of my next finger, and with 
them both gently drew the Ma-
|P_10
trix (or Womb) towards the 
Os Pubis (or Share-bone;) and 
as I dilated with my two fingers, 
at the same time, I relieved and 
kept back the Child's head from 
the Os Pubis. Which practice 
I have always found successful: 
for by such proceeding the Child 
is retarded (or kept back,) the 
Pains strengthened, and the La-
bour happily finish'd in a little 
time; as it hath happened to 
me innumerable times, in such 
Labours. I deliver'd this Wo-
man in two hours, as I assured 
her she would be, when I first 
came to her: she seem'd not to 
credit me, but found it truth. 
I have attended the same Wo-
man divers times; all her La-
bours are near the same, yet she 
and the Children do well, and 
hath tolerable Lyings-in.

[}The Delivery of a Woman 
whose Life was despaired 
of, her Child lying so long 
on the Os Pubis. }]
I WAS sent for to North-cur-
ry, to a Shoemaker's wife; 
I found her in a very deplorable 
condition, and by all her friends 
given to Death; for they told 
me, That the Shoemaker's for-
mer wife was in the very same 
case as this, and she died unde-
liver'd; and they were sure this 
Woman would also. The poor 
Woman sitting up in a chair, 
with the symptoms of Death in 
her face, and all spectators pro-
|P_12
nouncing Death against her, I 
Touch'd her, and assur'd them 
all, that, with God's assistance, 
I did not doubt of delivering 
her in two hours; which I ac-
cordingly did: both Mother and 
Child did well. I have deliver'd 
her of several Children since, 
and she is yet alive. I could not 
help smiling, to hear how the 
womens sentiments alter'd; for 
they were positive in their opi-
nions, That had I been with the 
first wife, she had not died. This 
Woman's Case was much like the 
Woman's in the fourth Obser-
vation. The Matrix was open, 
and the Midwife had taken great 
pains to deliver this poor Wo-
man: but instead of relieving 
the Child off the Os Pubis, she 
work'd on the Back; a practice 
too much approv'd of by most 
authors. My principal aim in 
|P_13
this, is to inform my sisters in 
the Profession, That if they 
know how to relieve the Child 
from the Os Pubis, they need not 
fear; the Back-part will soon 
yield full fast enough for any 
Woman to bear: I always found 
it so; and have been oblig'd to 
support the Back-part with my 
hands, to prevent its being in-
jured.

[}Observation VI. }]
[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
in the uttermost danger of 
Life, by the After-Burthen 
being left behind eight days. }]
I WAS sent for to a Tucker's 
wife in Taunton, in High-
Street. She was taken with a 
Convulsion Fit, was two and 
twenty weeks gone with Child, 
and in the Fit the Child came 
from her; her Midwife, who 
liv'd the next door, was instant-
ly call'd to her assistance, but 
could not bring the Secundine
(or After-Birth) away. The poor 
Woman lay in an extreme weak 
condition, with continual Flood-
|P_15
ings; a Physician attended her, 
and order'd her Medicines to 
stop them. As soon as he was 
gone, her Midwives (for then 
she had three with her) consult-
ed, and agreed to boil Herbs, 
and give her, to force the Se-
cundine (or After-Birth) away. 
But soon after, she being to all 
human reason expiring, the Phy-
sician was sent for again, to stop 
her Floodings; and in that de-
plorable condition she lay eight days, when I was sent for. I 
Touch'd her, and found the 
Mouth of the Matrix open, 
about the breadth of a Shilling. 
I introduc'd my fore-finger, and 
then the second; and with great 
difficulty I brought off the After-
Birth in divers pieces, very rot-
tenand offensive. I was obliged 
gently to press my left hand on 
her Belly, to keep the Matrix
|P_16
steddy, or else it could not have 
been done. The Woman re-
cover'd, and liv'd many years, 
and had one Child after; con-
trary to the opinion of her Mid-
wives, they thinking it impos-
sible for her to recover. The 
Physician met me the next 
morning at her house, and gave 
me thanks for the service I had 
done his Patient. He said, 'twas 
always his opinion it must be 
brought off; but her Midwives 
said it could not be done. It 
was near five months before 
she recover'd strength to go 
abroad.

[}Observation VII. }]
[}The Delivery of two Women, 
their Children having a 
Dropsy in their Heads. }]
AT Taunton I attended an 
Inn-keeper's Wife. She 
was taken in Labour on a Thurs
day, and sent for her Midwife, 
who gave her hopes of a speedy 
Delivery. About midnight the 
Waters broke, and Pains a little 
abated, till Friday evening, and 
then her Pangs return'd very 
violent. She remain'd in that 
extremity till I was sent for, 
which was on Sunday evening: 
I found her more likely to die 
than to live, which made me 
|P_18
unwilling to undertake her De-
livery; but she desired me, for 
God's sake, to do it, if she died 
the next moment. Her incon-
soleable case oblig'd me to un-
dertake her Delivery. In Touch-
ing her, I found the Child came 
with the Breech foremost, and 
both Feet lay across the Neck: 
whereupon, exerting my utmost 
strength, I brought the Feet to 
the Knees; and, with the assis-
tance of a woman, extracted 
the Child to the Neck: but 
finding the Head stick, I search'd, 
and found the Head very large, 
and protuberant with water; 
the Coronal Sutures being sepa-
rated at least two inches from 
each other, occasioned by the 
large quantity of water con-
tain'd in the Child's Head. I 
made an Incision between the 
Sutures; the water flow'd free-
|P_19
ly: I then had but little diffi-
culty to bring the Head, and 
soon after brought away the Se-
cundine (or After-Birth.) It was 
very black; owing, I believe, to 
a Mortification she had in her 
Belly; of which she died the 
third day after Delivery. When 
dead, I perceived her Belly 
to be as green as grass, being 
mortified. It proceeded, as I 
conceive, from a great pressure 
often repeated, by the Women, 
in keeping her Belly down, ac-
cording to her Midwife's direc-
tions. The reason she gave me 
for it was, That all the Woman's 
Pains, instead of Bearing down, 
every Pain rose up the Child, 
and straiten'd her Belly, round 
her Navel, as tho' it would have 
broke thro'. I laid my hand on 
her Belly, and it seem'd to me, 
that all the substance between 
|P_20
the Child's Head and my hand, 
was not thicker than fine paper. 
The Woman told me, That af-
ter her Waters were gone, she 
never had one Pain like those 
she used to have of her former 
Children; she having had seven 
before. I easily perceiv'd the 
reason, when I found the Child's 
Head erected as high as possible; 
for 'tis common for Children, 
whilst alive, to make the strong-
est efforts to be born the way 
the Head lies: but after this 
Child was dead, the largeness of 
the Head hindered the Pangs 
being successful, but, on the 
contrary, became very injurious. 
I put a Tunnel in the Child's 
Head, where I made the Punc-
ture>, and pour'd in five full 
pints of water, and judg'd it 
would have held half a pint 
more, which made the Head 
|P_21
prodigiously large, and impos-
sible to be born of any woman 
in the world. And for want of 
this Woman's being deliver'd 
when her Waters broke, she lost 
her life: which is very plain; 
for a Smith's wife, a near neigh-
bour, and intimate acquaintance 
of her's, was at that time about 
twelve weeks gone with Child. 
She was often with the Woman, 
and saw the Child; which was 
a great imbecility in her, and 
so it is with any Woman that is 
pregnant, to see any thing that 
may affect their Infants, as this 
did: for two months before her 
Time was expired, she sent for 
me, and desir'd my assistance 
whenever her Labour came on, 
she telling me, she was positive 
her Child would be the same as 
her deceased friend's. She told 
me she was in the same way 
|P_22
as her friend; she had heard 
her complain often, whilst with 
Child: and, indeed, it proved 
too true. For when I was sent 
for to her, I found her Labour, 
and the Situation of the Child, 
and the Dropsical Head, with 
every particular, as the Inn-
holder's wife. As soon as the 
Waters broke, I search'd for the 
Feet, so brought the Child's 
Body; but was oblig'd to make 
an Incision in the Head, as in 
the former Child. Her whole 
time of Delivery exceeded not 
an hour; the Child's Head con-
tained near the same quantity of 
Water as t'other Child. She 
did very well, and had several 
Children after: which is a plain 
demonstration, if the other wo-
man had been deliver'd as soon 
as her Waters broke, (the only 
time to deliver all Wrong Births) 
|P_23
she might have lived; for their 
Labours begun equal, the Chil-
dren exact alike; the bulk of 
the Head, and the distance of 
the Sutures, as tho' it had been 
the first Child born twice. I 
hope it will be a warning to all 
Breeding Women, that may read 
or know it, not to be at Difficult 
or Uncommon Labours.

[}Observation VIII. }]
[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
who was likely to be ruined 
thro' the ignorance of her 
Midwife. }]
A FEW days after I was 
sent for, by St. Mary 
Magdelen's Church, to a Woman 
|P_24
who had been in Labour two 
days and three nights. The 
Midwife that was with her told 
her friends, she believ'd she could 
not be Deliver'd. They hearing 
I was near (for I was attending 
on a Gentlewoman who was near 
her Time) sent for me. When 
I came, I found the Woman ex-
tremely fatigued, in a violent 
Transudation, that even her 
gown was wet with Sweat: I 
never saw a Woman in greater 
extremity. I Touch'd her, and 
found the Child lay right, but 
over the Os Pubis. I was sur-
priz'd in Touching her, to find 
her Fundament spread broader 
than the palm of my hand. I 
ask'd the Midwife what she had 
been doing: she told me that in 
opening the outer gate, (as she 
call'd it) was the way, said she, 
to help the inner. I was asto-
|P_25
nish'd at her ignorance; but 
have found since that it is too 
common a practice, even among 
the Men (but not the judicious) 
as well as Women Midwives, to 
work on the Back-part, which 
they have no business to med-
dle with; unless it be to sup-
port it from the injury 'tis often 
in danger of. I immediately 
endeavour'd to deliver her, by 
passing my two fore-fingers be-
tween the Os Pubis and the 
Child's Head. I soon reliev'd it, 
and in one hour and a quarter 
I deliver'd her of a lusty Boy. 
Both Mother and Child did well. 
'Tis my Opinion, had I not as-
sisted this Woman, she must soon 
have been ruin'd, if not lost her 
Life.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
the Child's Arm being 
without the Birth four 
days. }]
IN Bridgewater I was sent 
for to a street below Hunt-
spill, to a Farmer's wife, who 
had been in Labour four days. 
Her Midwife told me, That her 
Waters had broke, and the Child's 
Arm presented on Thursday 
night, and then her Pangs left 
her: which is very common in 
all Wrong Births. They sent 
for me on Sunday morning. I 
ask'd the Midwife, Why she had 
not help sooner? She reply'd, 
|P_27
She waited for Pains. I then 
inform'd her, That in all Wrong 
Births Pains were of no Use, 
but, on the contrary, pernicious. 
The poor Woman had been so 
ill used, that it was some time 
before I could persuade her to 
suffer me to Touch her, saying 
she chose to die, rather than go 
through any more Pain in that 
manner. I assur'd her, with the 
Omnipotent's leave, I would de-
liver her in less than half an 
hour. She then consented I 
should try. I laid her a-cross 
the Bed, on her Knees, with a 
bolster and pillow under her 
Stomach, that her Belly might 
lie hollow; which I have found, 
in general, to be the easiest and 
best way, giving liberty for 
turning a Child. I Touch'd her, 
and found the Child's Arm hal'd 
out, as far as the Shoulder, and 
|P_28
broke in two places. I slid my 
hand gently along the Child's 
Arm and Ribs, with some diffi-
culty; so advanced further, till 
I found one Foot, and drew it 
towards me; the other soon 
follow'd. I wrap'd them in lin-
nen, for the better hold, and 
deliver'd her, altho' the Child 
was much swelld. I suppose 
the Infant had been dead from 
the Friday before. In her De-
livery she never complain'd once 
of any Pain. I ask'd her, How 
she could bear the turning of 
her Child, and Delivery without 
complaining? She told me, She 
had endur'd a thousand times 
more Pain by the hands of her 
Midwife; and some Handy Wo-
men (as they call them) which 
were about her, told her, That 
send for whom she wou'd, she 
could never be deliver'd; but 
|P_29
they were soon convinced of 
their absurdity and brutish deal-
ing with the poor Sufferer; for 
she was deliver'd, and laid in 
her Bed in a comfortable man-
ner, in less than half an hour, 
to their great surprize. She 
had a good Lying-in, and was 
abroad in three Weeks.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
whose Child had been dead 
four Months, and not Pu-
trified. }]
IN Taunton, a Smith's wife, 
being a Washer-woman, de-
sired my assistance when she 
should want it. She told me, 
She had not felt the Child, since 
|P_30
she quicken'd, for a month. For 
hanging some cloaths on a line 
to dry, it being out of her reach, 
she felt a prodigious Motion of 
her Child, and never felt it af-
terwards. Her Reckoning be-
ing almost out, she desir'd my 
assistance; (If she was with Child?) 
I told her, I did not doubt but 
she was; but 'twas my opinion 
the Child was dead from that 
time. She shew'd me her Breasts, 
which were as full of Milk, as if 
she had been a Nurse. She was 
obliged to milk them twice a 
day; and never milk'd less than 
half a pint a day, out of each 
at a time. 

She went a Month beyond 
her Reckoning, and then she 
had several Pains. That day 
she sent for me in the evening: 
I Touch'd her, and found her 
Water sunk without the Neck 
|P_31
of the Womb: the skin that re-
tain'd it was so very thin, that 
with the least touch it broke. I 
received some of the Water in 
my hand, found it very clear, 
and without the least putrid 
smell; which I wonder'd at: it 
being usual when a Child is 
dead to be offensive. Her Pains 
being trifling, and the Matrix
lying high, and out of my power 
to reach, I order'd her to Bed, 
and to continue there till her 
Pains grew stronger: which be-
ing done, about four in the 
morning, she sent for me. I 
then found her in stronger Pains; 
she said they were not like the 
Bearing Pains she used to have 
with her former Children. I 
found the Child presented with 
its Breech foremost, and brought 
it off in a little time: but the 
Burden adher'd so close to the 
|P_32
Matrix I was obliged to peel it 
off, in the manner you would 
the rind from a young tree. 
And, what is worth observation, 
the Burden was at least two 
inches thick, but full as pale as 
the Lungs of any animal. 'Tis, 
therefore, plain, that altho' the 
Child was dead, yet that grew 
more than in a living Child. 
The Woman did exceeding well, 
and was capable of washing in 
three weeks after. When the 
Child was born, the Navel-string 
was seven times round the Neck: 
which palpably shews, as the 
Mother was throwing a sheet 
over a line, the sudden jerk oc-
casion'd the Child’s being stran-
gled with the Navel-string, the 
Child being whole and entire, 
without the least Putrefaction; 
notwithstanding it had been dead 
at least four months: an instance 
|P_33
I never met with in all my 
Practice. I wish this may be a 
warning to all Women with 
Child, to take care not to over-
reach themselves; that being 
often the loss of many Infants, 
as well as Mothers.

[}The Delivery of a Woman 
with the Child's Shoulder 
foremost. }]
I WAS sent for in Taunton, 
to a Cobler's wife, who had 
been some time in Labour. Her 
Midwife told me her Child was 
right, which made her wonder 
the Child did not come forward, 
with so many strong Pains as 
|P_34
she had for a Day and Night. 
I soon inform'd her 'twas the 
Child's Shoulder, and not the 
Head. I endeavour'd to place 
the Child right, which I did, 
tho' it soon return'd to the for-
mer Position. I plac'd it right 
three times, and still it return'd 
again; tho' some Authors have 
advised, when the Child lies not 
right, it must be placed so, then 
deliver the Woman. But I be-
lieve such Authors wrote, what 
they never practised; if they 
did, they ought to have in-
form'd the Readers how the 
Child's Head should be kept in 
the right Position when plac'd, 
and how they should procure 
Pains to accomplish such a De-
livery: for as soon as I had 
placed the Child's Head right, 
all her Pains ceased; which is 
common in such Births; and 
|P_35
obliged me to search for the 
Feet. I brought the Child as 
far as the Head; then was for-
ced to put my two fore-fingers 
of my left hand into its Mouth, 
and gently press down the Chin 
to its breast with my right hand 
on the shoulders, and compleat-
ed the Delivery. 

The Child when born had not 
the least appearance of life in 
it; but the Mother did very 
well soon.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
her Child being Dead, and 
much Putrified. }]
I WAS sent for to Pitmister, 
to a Woman who had been 
in Travail four days, and her 
Child dead the greatest part of 
the time; for the Skin of it 
flay'd off, as I deliver'd her. The 
Woman being very low and 
weak, I thought it would be 
least Pain to her to unbrain the 
Child, I being well assured it 
was dead, by the black offensive 
Water that flow'd from the Ma-
trix. In such Cases, where 
there is a certainty of the 
|P_37
Child's being dead, and the 
Head foremost, it is the easiest 
and quickest way of Delivery. 
But I think it vile practice to 
take such methods whilst the 
Child is alive, and a Woman in 
full strength; tho' 'tis now be-
come too common a practice: 
there being many Infants born 
crying, with their Brains work-
ing out of their Heads. But how 
such Operators can clear them-
selves of the blood of the In-
fants so destroy'd, I cannot ima-
gine; nor what their thoughts 
may be in such vile performan-
ces: I doubt it will give them 
no consoleable reflections on a 
dying bed. (This by way of 
digression.) Having no incision-
knife with me, I was obliged to 
use a penknife. I secured the 
blade with a piece of rag near 
the point, and directed that to 
|P_38
the Sutures of the Child's Head, 
guarding the point under the 
first joint of my fore-finger, to 
prevent injuring the Woman. 
I made a large Puncture in the 
Head, and then perform'd the 
remainder with my fingers, by 
taking several large pieces of 
the Skull and Brains; then 
taking hold of the back-part of 
the Neck, I deliver'd her in a 
little time. The Child was ve-
ry much putrified, as was the 
Secundine, but the Woman did 
well. She had two Midwives 
with her, yet did little service 
towards her Delivery; which 
they told me they wonder'd at. 
I made them sensible the diffi-
culty was occasioned by the 
Child's lying on the Os Pubis; 
for, by all circumstances, she 
might have been deliver'd, at 
least, two days before, had either 
|P_39
of the Midwives understood how 
to have proceeded in such a 
Labour.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
with the Child's Arm fore-
most, and much swelled. }]
I WAS sent for to a Weaver's 
wife in St. James's Parish, 
a business she was oblig'd to fol-
low herself, altho' a work very 
injurious to Pregnant Women, 
especially short women. I have 
been with a great many wrong 
and difficult Births, I believe 
owing to the Woollen Trade, in 
which many women are obliged 
to be employ'd, in that town, 
|P_40
and places adjacent, and no Man-
midwife in the place, nor any 
Woman that was capable to go 
thro' the least difficulty; so that 
the whole of bad Labours lay 
heavy on me: which frequent-
ly happening, render'd it so fa-
tiguing and pernicious to my 
health, as to oblige me to leave 
the place; and tho', thank God, 
I have recover'd since, yet I 
have been much concern'd to 
hear that many Mothers and 
Children have lost their lives, 
since my departure. One great 
reason of my recollecting these 
Observations, is, That as I can-
not be serviceable in my person, 
I may be doubly so to those 
who profess or undertake the 
Art of Midwifery; and not to 
set down the least practice of 
any other persons, but faithfully 
to distribute, with the Omnipo-
|P_41
tent's leave, my own perform-
ances. When I came to the 
aforemention'd Woman, I found 
the Arm hal'd out as far as the 
Shoulder. I ask'd, What Mid-
wife had been with her? They 
said none; but I assur'd them 
'twas false, and insisted on know-
ing who she was. Then they 
told me it was the Midwife that 
lived by; and when she heard 
of my being sent for, she went 
home: because I had been often 
after her bad works, and could 
not help condemning her for 
keeping Women long in hand, 
as she usually did, not suffering 
me to be sent for till the Child 
was dead, and the Woman in 
great danger. She had been 
with this Woman two days and 
one Night. I sent for her, to 
admonish her not to keep Wo-
men in such dangerous condi-
|P_42
tions, so long. She refusing to 
come, I thought it high time 
to deliver the Woman: I then 
search'd for the Feet, but found 
them very difficult to be come 
at, she being a little short Wo-
man, and a large Child dead; 
the Arm and Shoulders much 
swell'd, which render'd her De-
livery much more troublesome. 
I gently push'd the Child's Arm 
back as far as I could, which 
gave me a little room to slide 
my hand as far as the Ribs; but 
being seiz'd with the Cramp, 
oblig'd me to withdraw it: af-
ter rubbing it a little, I enter'd 
again, and got hold of one Foot. 
The Cramp seizing me a second 
time, I was obliged to let go 
my hold; but kept my hand 
sstill to ease it, and give the Wo-
man rest: for, 'tis to be obser-
ved, when the hand is in the 
|P_43
body, and in motion, it creates 
great pain to the Woman. There-
fore they who undertake such 
Deliveries, must be endow'd 
with great patience, justice, good 
judgment, and full resolution, 
with God's blessing, to go thro' 
such Deliveries. I drew the 
Foot towards me, which gave 
room to take hold of the other 
Foot. As the Feet advanc'd 
the Arm drew back. But after 
I had brought the Child as far 
as the Knees, I was obliged to 
have the assistance of a woman, 
and we both us'd all our strength 
to bring it to the Shoulders. I 
then brought down one Hand 
and Arm, for more room, and 
left the other, to prevent the 
Matrix from contracting round 
 the Neck, which sometimes hap-
pens. I put two fingers of my 
left hand into the Child's mouth, 
|P_44
and my right hand upon its 
shoulders, so happily deliver'd 
her. I brought off the Secun-
dine entirely whole. 

And notwithstanding her hard 
Labour, she was capable of work-
ing in her Loom a fortnight 
after.

[}The Delivery of a Woman 
with Twins, the one came 
right and the other wrong. }]
I WAS sent for to a Woman 
near St. James's Church; 
she had been in Labour from 
Tuesday to Friday. I found her 
in a low, weak condition; and, 
to the eye of reason, very near 
Death. I understood by her-
|P_45
self and women, That she had 
been in strong Labour all that 
time, and quite tir'd out. Her 
Pulse was very low, her Breath 
short, her Nostrils working, so 
that I thought her near expire-
ing. I ask'd her Midwife the 
reason, Why she did not deliver 
her? She told me, Because God's 
time was not come: (a common 
saying amongst illiterate and un-
skilful Midwives.) I told her, 
'Twas my opinion, when the 
signs of Travail appear'd so plain, 
and the Matrix open, the Wa-
ters voided, and strong Pangs, 
(as had been this Woman's case, 
by her own confession, the Tues-
day night before, and this was 
Friday in the afternoon) that it 
appear'd to me to be God's time 
then; and, doubtless, a Mid-
wife's place to do her duty. The 
Midwife told me there was an-
|P_46
other reason why she had a bad 
time, she perceiv'd the Child 
had long hair. 'Tis a reason I 
have heard often given; but, I 
think, shews ignorance in abun-
dance. 

I have been frequently sur-
prized to hear such silly reasons 
given, by Women practising 
where life is concern'd. I Touch'd 
the Woman, and found the Child 
fixed on the Os Pubis. I told 
the Midwife, I believ'd the Child 
had lain where it was, a consider-
able time. She said, Indeed she 
had not perceiv'd it to move (as 
she was pleas'd to term it) the 
length of a barley-corn since 
Tuesday night. I put the Wo-
man on a stool, which was the 
way she chose; for I think it 
best for Midwives to advise their 
Women to the safest way of De-
livery; which, in my opinion, 
|P_47
none so good as the Bed: (and 
next to that the Stool) yet I 
don't approve of compelling 
Women to any particular place 
against their inclinations. In 
half an hour I releas'd the Child 
from the Os Pubis, which in-
creas'd her Pains, so that in less 
than one hour I deliver'd her of 
a Boy. It was alive, but very 
weak. In searching for the Se-
cundine, I met with some Mem-
branes full of Water, which I 
broke, and found another Child 
coming with its Arm foremost. 
I search'd for the Feet, which I 
soon found, and deliver'd her of 
a second Son, and with small 
difficulty brought away the Af-
ter-Births entire. I put the 
Woman to Bed, seemingly to-
lerable well for her Condition; 
but the next day she had a 
violent Fever and Purging, 
|P_48
which continu'd till the fifth 
day, and then died. 

Without dispute her Fever 
and Purging, proceeded from 
the many hot forcing things 
they gave her in her long and 
painful Travail; which is an 
usual, but an intolerable prac-
tice. The first Child lived two 
days, the second three; so that 
the Life of the Mother, and two 
Children were lost for want of 
judgment, and good manage-
ment.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
the Child presenting the 
Face foremost. }]
I WAS sent for to Wilton, to 
a Woman in Labour. I 
found her in small Pain, but the 
Child coming with the Face 
foremost, and she very low-spi-
rited, because her Labour al-
ter'd very much from what it 
used to be with her former Chil-
dren. I told her, If she would 
keep herself on the Bed, lying 
on her Back till she had strong 
Pains, that there was no dan-
ger, and that she'd do well. She 
continu'd that day in small 
|P_50
Pains till the next morning five 
o'clock, when I was sent for 
again, and about seven deliver'd 
her of a stout Girl, and well, 
except the Face, which was a 
little swell'd and black; a Case 
common when the Face pre-
sents first. In these Deliveries, 
if Midwives are not very care-
ful, they may do a great deal 
of hurt to the Face and Eyes of 
the Child, as I shall shew in my 
next Observation, where it pro-
ved so.

[}A Woman in the country be-
ing deliver'd before I got to 
her House, and the Child 
much injured. }]
I WAS sent for to Curry-
Mallet to a Tanner's wife, 
about eleven o'Clock at night, 
it being very bad weather, and 
bad roads as ever were rode, so 
that before I got there, the Child 
was born. I did not go up stairs 
directly to see the Mother and 
Child. The Women saying all 
was well, I thought proper to 
dry my cloaths, being very wet 
and tired, (for 'twas eight long 
miles.) When I had dry'd and 
|P_52
recover'd myself, I went up stairs, 
and to my great surprize saw the 
Child with one Eye out, and the 
whole Face much injur'd, having 
no skin left on it, and the upper 
Lip tore quite hollow from the 
Jaw-bone was extremely swell'd, 
so that the Child could make no 
use of it. I put some warm wa-
ter and sugar in the Child's 
mouth, with a small spoon, and 
resting it upon the Tongue, the 
poor Infant suck'd it down. I 
ask'd the Midwife, How the 
Child's Face came to be so 
miserably hurt? She told me 
the Mother fell down two days 
before she was in Travail, and, 
as she thought, hurt the Child, 
for she was sure it was born 
right. I told her I was sen-
sible the Child came Head fore-
most, but the Face present-
ed to the Birth; and the da-
|P_53
mage the Child received was 
from her fingers. She could 
not make any defence for her-
self: I found her extremely ig-
norant. 

I returned home, and sent 
proper dressings for the Child's 
Face. It did very well, and 
was a pretty girl, excluding the 
loss of her right Eye. (I saw 
her when she was five years of 
age.) 

I think this Observation worth 
taking notice of, to caution Mid-
wives to deal in a tender man-
ner, when the Child presents 
with the Face foremost, which 
may be known by touching the 
Child. The Eyes, the Mouth, 
the softness of Cheeks, will suf-
ficiently discover if the Face 
comes first; and then there 
must be waiting with patience. 
I have had several such Births 
|P_54
in my time; but, I thank God, 
never had a Child received the 
least hurt, tho' a little swell'd, 
and blackish; which is common 
in those Labours.

[}Of a Woman and Child both 
dying, thro' the ignorance 
and weakness of her Mid-
wife, and the shortness of 
the Navel-string. }]
I WAS sent for to a Comber's 
wife in East-street. The Wo-
man was deliver'd of her Child 
about One o'clock mid-day: I was 
sent for at eleven at night; but it 
was too late; for I found the Wo-
man dying. The relation of this 
|P_55
misfortune, which I had from 
the Midwife and women, was 
this. The poor Woman was ta-
ken in Labour about twelve 
o'Clock, and sent for her Mid-
wife and neighbours, who lived 
very near her, and by one o'-
Clock her Child was born. Her 
Midwife deliver'd her standing 
on her feet; (a way I cannot, 
in the least, approve of, tho' 
too commonly practis’d in the 
country) who being a feeble an-
cient woman, when the Child 
was born, could not bring the 
Secundine away; and the string 
breaking close to the head of it, 
occasion'd a violent Flooding, 
even to death: in which state I 
found her, quite drain'd, and 
past recovery. I desir'd to see 
the Child, and was prodigiously 
surprized, to see so fine a Child 
so unhappily and quickly lost; 
|P_56
for the Bowels were in the 
Omentum or Cawl, without the 
Belly: and searching into the 
cause of such a misfortune, found 
it occasion'd by the shortness of 
the Navel-string; the Woman's 
standing on her feet, and the 
weakness of the Midwife; so 
that the Woman's Pains being 
strong and forcing, the Child 
was born very suddenly: and 
for want of the Body thereof 
being supported, the weight of 
it broke the Navel-string close 
to the After-Birth; and, at the 
same time, tore out the Child's 
Bowels. It was born alive, but 
expired in half an hour. I re-
member about three or four 
years after this misfortune hap-
pen'd, I was sent for to a gen-
tlewoman, whom I had deliver'd 
of several Children. She had 
generally very good Times, and 
|P_57
I always deliver'd her in her 
Bed (which I take to be the 
only best way for Mother and 
Child.) When the Child was 
born to the pit of the Stomach, 
I found it would not proceed any 
farther, without the utmost 
strength. The aforemention'd 
accident came in my head, and 
resolving to be satisfy'd , I slid 
my hand to the Child's Belly, 
and felt the String strain'd very 
much: I then slid my fingers a 
little farther, and secured the 
Child from danger. I kept my 
fingers fast on the Navel-string, 
and with my left hand on the 
back-part of the Child, accom-
plish'd the Delivery. The short-
ness of the String occasion'd its 
breaking close to the Secundine; 
however, I brought the After-
birth in less than seven minutes. 
The Mother and Child did well; 
|P_58
and as I have deliver'd her of 
several Children since, so I don't 
doubt but the other case, being 
of this nature, both Mother 
and Child might have been pre-
serv'd, if the Woman had been 
in her Bed, and had had a Mid-
wife of judgment and activity, 
which is of grand service in our 
Profession. I have help'd into 
the world many Children with 
short Navel-strings, but never 
had any misfortune attend either 
Mother or Child. This Gentle-
woman's Child's String was not 
six inches long, the other about 
that length; the shortest I ever 
saw.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
the Child having a large 
Tumour on the Back, and 
other ways deform'd. }]
I WAS sent for to a Woman 
of my own, which used to 
have very good Times, but this 
did not prove so. I brought 
the Child's Head to the Shoul-
ders with great difficulty: and 
then it stuck so fast, that I was 
obliged to use all my strength 
to bring the remaining part of 
it; which difficulty was occa-
sion'd by a large tumour on the 
Back, which reach'd from the 
Shoulder-blades to the Funda-
|P_60
ment. In using so much strength 
the Tumour broke, and there 
was at least sixteen ounces of 
black matter, that resembled 
the Child's Excrements if it 
was not the same. It appear'd 
when full to be quite round, and 
about the bigness of the crown 
of a child's hat; it broke in the 
middle of the upper part, that 
being the thinnest. A Surgeon 
was sent for to take care of it, 
whilst she lived; which was but 
eight days. I thought it a great 
mercy to the Infant she died. 
The aforesaid part on the Back 
being laid open, all the Back-
bone lay bare; and she had no 
Muscle in the Fundament, but 
a little triangular hole, as tho' 
made with the point of a small 
sword. The Excrements squeez-
ed thro' as often as the Child's Legs were moved. The Knee-
|P_61
pans were under the Hams, the 
Feet in the place of the Ancles, 
and the Toes of one Foot, always 
lay on the Toes of the other; 
but it had the most beautiful 
Face and Hands that ever I saw 
an Infant have. 

The Mother did well, and had 
Children afterwards.

[}A Woman in great danger of 
her life, being extreme 
costive, but relieved by a 
Glyster. }]
I WAS sent for to Enmore, 
to a Gentlewoman who was 
very Hysterical and Melancholy, 
and six Months gone with Child. 
|P_62
Her Husband sent for a relation 
that lived in Taunton, and de-
sir'd me to ride with her. 'Twas 
six long miles, eight o'Clock at 
night, and a very bad road; so 
that 'twas ten before we got 
there. I found her very full of 
Pain, and a little delirious for 
want of rest, not having any for 
a week. Her Physician had 
given her many medicines to 
prevent a Miscarriage, which 
could do her no service, as will 
appear; but what he did was 
occasion'd by her Midwife's in-
forming him she was in danger 
of miscarrying: she told me the 
same, viz. That her Waters were 
broke, and she was sure she 
would miscarry. I desired to 
see some of the linnen that was 
wet with the Waters: They told 
me they were wash'd, therefore 
could not presently be a judge of 
|P_63
her Case; and being a stranger 
to her, she would not admit of 
my Touching her: but her hus-
band and relations at last pre-
vail'd with her, to suffer me to 
satisfy myself and them of her 
condition. It was then about 
three o'Clock in the morning. 
I told them she must have a 
Glyster: but some of her friends 
and the Midwife were entirely 
against it, thinking it needless; 
and the reason they gave was, 
her being a very little eater. I 
told them 'twas impossible to 
inform myself, whether she had 
any Symptoms of Miscarriage, 
till the Excrements were remo-
ved; which could be no other 
way, with security, done, than 
by a Glyster. I could not per-
suade them of the usefulness of 
it, till five in the morning, 
when the Glyster was given, and 
|P_64
she (ten minutes after) evacuated 
such a large quantity as surpriz'd 
them all; and after her second 
stool (for she had but two, and 
indeed 'twas enough) she dropt 
asleep, and did not wake till 
two of the clock in the after-
noon, when she found herself 
easy, and quite compos'd. I then 
Touch'd her, but could not dis-
cover the least Symptoms of 
Miscarrying. She went out her 
Time, and did very well. She 
and her friends were then con-
vinced of the advantages that 
did occur from that advice, I 
being well assured all her Pangs 
proceeded from the want of an 
Evacuation. I have observed it 
to be a common case among 
Women with Child, and always 
relieved them with a Glyster, 
and found it a means to prevent 
Miscarrying; altho' it is very 
|P_65
useful to promote Delivery, when 
Women are at their full Time.

[}The Delivery of a Woman 
who had Twins, her first 
Child being born the day 
before. }]
I WAS sent for to Bishop's 
Lead-Yard, to a Woman in 
the utmost extremity. She was 
taken in Labour on Friday, and 
on Saturday about Noon she had 
one Child. Her Midwife put 
some warm water in a close-stool, 
and set her on it, and desir'd her 
to strain with her Pains. The 
first Child fell into the pan of 
water; notwithstanding which 
|P_66
it was alive when I came there. 
Her Midwife endeavouring to 
fetch the Secundine, found there 
was another Child, and told the 
Woman when the other apple 
was ripe, it would also fall. (O 
ignorance!) But she found her-
self mistaken: for on Sunday 
morning, her Husband came for 
me in a violent hurry, telling 
me he fear'd his Wife could not 
live till I got there. We rode 
as fast as possible, and 'twas but 
five miles from Taunton, yet 
we had two messengers sent af-
ter us for expedition, for all 
her Women thought her dying. 
When I came there I found the 
Child so fixed to the Os Pubis, 
that I had an hour and half as 
hard work as ever I had in my 
life: tho' the Child was born 
alive, and lived till the Satur-
day following. The first Child 
|P_67
died the Wednesday before. I met 
with great difficulty in bringing 
the After-Births: they were ve-
ry large, and extremely close 
join'd to the bottom of the Ma-
trix. With my left hand I was 
oblig'd to keep her Belly down, 
with all my strength, whilst 
with my right hand I peel'd off 
and loosen'd the Secundines from 
the Matrix. My hands were 
seiz'd with the Cramp twice; 
which oblig'd me each time 
to hold my hand still till the 
Cramp was gone: which made 
it near twenty minutes before I 
could bring them both away. 
It was the longest time that ever 
I was in performing that part 
of my business; tho' had I been 
with her when the first Child 
was born, I should have deli-
ver'd her of the second Child in 
fifteen minutes or less. For 'tis 
|P_68
certain, if a Midwife understands 
her business as she ought, she 
might bring the second Child 
soon after the first: for general-
ly in the Birth of Twins, when 
the first is born, the other should 
be brought by Art; for I never 
found there was any occasion 
either to wait for Pains, or to 
put a Woman to any more than 
ten or fifteen minutes pain, af-
ter I had deliver'd her of the 
first Child: especially if the first 
comes right, and the second wrong, as it generally proves.

eight miles off. When I came 
|P_70
to the Soap-boiler's house, I 
found the Woman in a good na-
tural Labour: I deliver'd her 
in two hours: 'twas about seven 
o'Clock in the morning. As soon 
as she was deliver'd, I desir'd 
them to send to the afore-men-
tion'd poor man's Wife, to know 
if they had got a Midwife; if 
not, I would go to her. They 
sent me word they had one, and 
they believ'd she would be de-
liver'd in a little time; but 
about eleven o'Clock, as I was 
riding home, I call'd at the 
house, to know if she was deli-
ver'd: they told me no, but she 
would be in a quarter of an hour, 
so they would not give me the 
trouble of going in to see her. 
I then rode home, and about 
four o'Clock in the afternoon, 
her Husband came for me, to 
desire me to ride to his Wife, 
|P_71
for the women told him, they 
believ'd she'd never be deliver'd. 
I can't but say it displeas'd me, 
that they refus'd my seeing her, 
when I was so near. I went with 
him, and when I came, found 
the Woman in violent Labour. 
The Midwife told me the Child 
lay as it did, ever since seven 
o'clock in the morning. As 
soon as I Touch'd her, I was sen-
sible of the reason of this poor 
Woman's being kept so long in 
distress. I sat down by her. She 
was on her Knees, one of the 
usual ways in the Country, but a 
wretched one. I found strong 
Pains had been so long upon her, 
that I could round the Head of 
the Child with my whole hand, 
when she had no Pains. The 
first Pain she had, after I was 
with her, I broke her Waters, 
and was forc'd to be very quick 
|P_72
to receive the Child; for her 
Pains being violent, and the 
Child so long confin'd by the 
thickness of the Skin that held 
the Waters, as soon as the 
Child had liberty, it was born 
in less than half a minute, which 
astonish'd the Midwife and Wo-
men: they would fain have pre-
vailed on me to have told them 
what I did; but I chose not to 
inform them at that time. It 
is very evident, that this Wo-
man suffer'd seven or eight 
hours Pain more than she need 
have done, had she had a Mid-
wife of judgment in the begin-
ning of her Travail. 

I have often been sent for to 
the assistance of Women in the 
same circumstances, and have 
several times found them flood-
ing. The only reason has been, 
for want of breaking the Waters, 
|P_73
the violent Pains opening some 
of the Vessels, and loosening 
part of the After-Birth. For 
'tis an undoubted rule, If Pains 
do no good, they do a great 
deal of harm.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
who had a great Flux of 
Blood, a month before her 
Time. }]
I WAS sent for into East-
street, to a Comber's Wife, 
one of my Women. When I 
came I found a violent Flowing 
of the Menses; and believe she 
lost near a gallon of Blood. She 
being up, I order'd her to Bed. 
|P_74
I ask'd her, How near she was 
to her Reckoning? She told 
me one Month. Touching her, 
I found little Symptoms of La-
bour: I told her my opinion 
was, she Long'd for something. 
She said she did not Long, but 
had been in pain twelve hours 
before her Flooding: which con-
firm'd my opinion touching her 
Longing. She still deny'd it, 
till I told her that both she and 
the Child would doubtless lose 
their lives, unless she speedily 
had what she had an Inclination 
for: she answerd, What should 
poor people Long for? I assur'd 
her if 'twas any thing could be 
had, I would get it, let the 
price be what it would. She 
knew nothing she Long'd for, 
except a Peasecod, that she saw 
a boy hold up against the Sun: 
she presently after had Pains, 
|P_75
(which was the day before.) In-
quiring I heard of a Gentleman 
that had a present of some, sent 
him from a garden in the coun-
try, and the first that were in 
the town. I got some of them 
for her: as soon as she had eaten 
them her Menses ceas'd. She 
went the Time of her Reckon-
ing, and had a good Labour. I 
deliver'd her of a Son: the Child 
and Mother both did well. Such 
things as these frequently hap-
pen. 

Therefore have reason to be-
lieve that Forc'd Deliveries in 
these Cases, have destroyed ma-
ny Lives. I could give various 
Instances of this kind in my 
practice, but chuse only this 
by way of caution, because Wo-
men are very apt to conceal their 
Longings, which makes them of-
ten very great sufferers thereby.

[}Observation XXIII. }]
[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
with great difficulty, her 
Child presenting the Arm 
first. }]
I WAS sent for to a School-
Mistress: when I came, I 
found her Pains small, her Wa-
ters broke four days before: she 
was very ill, and had a Fever. 
I Touch'd her, and found the 
Child lay a-cross. One Arm and 
the Ribs presenting first, the 
Waters being past, and her Bo-
dy hot and dry, I apprehended 
'twould be a difficult Labour; 
and so it proved: for as I slid my 
fingers along the Ribs, to search 
|P_77
for the Feet, my Hand and Arm 
was so seized with the Cramp, 
as obliged me to withdraw my 
Hand for fifteen minutes. I at-
tempted again, but without suc-
cess. I was very uneasy, know-
ing such attempts put the Wo-
man to fresh Pain. In short, I 
was forced to rest till my Arm 
was better, when I made another 
attempt, and, with God's leave, 
perform'd the Delivery, without 
withdrawing my Hand any more, 
although my Hand was several 
times numbed, before I could 
reach the Feet: but as I ad-
vanced I found the Child alive, 
and suck'd my finger in the 
Womb, which concern'd me; 
fearing it impossible for the poor 
Infant to be born alive, because 
of the circumstances already 
given; the Mother's weakness, 
and the Child's largeness. But 
|P_78
recovering my thoughts, I re-
solved to do my duty for the 
poor Woman's sake, and leave 
the event to the Omniscient 
God. I was obliged to be ex-
ceeding careful and slow, yet 
resolved with all my strength, 
and a full resolution, to accom-
plish what I was about. When 
I had hold of one Foot, I found 
it hard work to hold it, and 
draw it towards me, by reason I 
could hold it but with my two 
fore-fingers at first. However, 
I kept my hold, and in a small 
time brought the Feet out of 
the Uterus (or Womb.) I brought 
also the Legs out to the Knees; 
then I wrapt them in a linnen 
cloth, and gave them to two 
strong Women, and desir'd them 
to draw in a strait line, whilst I 
took care of the Woman's body, 
|P_79
to prevent any injury, and se-
cure the Child that it might be 
brought off whole; which, thro' 
mercy I compleated. The Secun-
dine stuck closer to the Matrix
than is common in these Cases; 
which, I believe, was owing to 
the dryness of the Womb from 
her Fever. The Child had not 
the least appearance of life, and 
'twas impossible it should: this 
Delivery being at least an hour 
and half's hard work, which sel-
dom happens: for in common 
wrong Births it is very rarely 
more than half an hour, and of-
ten not fifteen minutes. I don't 
remember above four such ter-
rible Labours, in all my prac-
tice. The Woman did well. I 
have set this Observation down 
as plain as possible, to encourage 
Midwives, that they may with 
justice and safety go thro' the 
|P_80
most difficult part of their work, 
as well as that which is easy. I 
could not turn in my bed, with-
out help, for two or three days 
after, nor lift my Arm to my 
Head for near a week; and for-
ced to bathe my Arm with Spi-
rit of Wine several times a day.

[}The Delivery of a Woman, 
the Child having two Tu-
mours on the Head. }]
I WAS with a Comber's wife, 
a near neighbour to the Wo-
man mention'd in my last Ob-
servation: she had been in La-
bour, and her Midwife with her 
several days. I ask'd the Mid-
|P_81
wife the reason why she did not 
deliver her. She could give 
me no account, whether the 
Child was right or wrong; but 
Touching her, I found the Shoul-
der-blade presented first. I ad-
vanc'd farther in search of the 
Feet, and found the Child's Na-
vel-string without the least Pul-
sation, which satisfy'd me 'twas 
dead. I found the Feet, and 
drew them towards me, so com-
pleated the Delivery in less than 
half an hour. Viewing the Child, 
I saw on the back part of the 
Head two large Tumours, one 
above the other, as if the Wa-
ter contain'd in the under Tu-
mour, did, when full, ascend to 
the upper one, which reached 
to the Crown of the Head. The 
biggest was as large as a Goose's 
egg, and the other about half 
that size. I open'd them both; 
|P_82
'twas only clear Water that is-
sued out of them: it lay be-
tween the hairy Scalp and the 
Skull. The Woman did well; 
but had a Fever for five days; 
which I imputed to some strong 
waters given her for her Pains, 
as they said; which I think a 
pernicious Custom. 

[^A rectangular decorative figure, one and a half lines in height.^]
[}Observation XXV. }]
[}A Woman in the country be-
ing deliver'd before I got 
there, her Child being very 
much mangled. }]
I WAS sent for to Hatch, to 
a Farmer's wife, but before 
I could get there a Midwife had 
deliver'd her: she was in a very 
|P_83
low condition, more likely to 
die than to live. The Child 
was sew'd up in a piece of Flan-
nel, and cover'd with Flowers in 
order for its Burial. I desir'd 
to see the Child, but the Mid-
wife refus'd for some time. I 
insisted on its being undress'd, 
which was accordingly done. 
When I saw the Infant, I was 
much surprized; for the left 
Arm was tore off, in a most in-
decent manner. I ask'd the 
Midwife, If she was sure the 
Child was dead before she pro-
ceeded in so rash a manner? 
She told me she did not know 
but it was: for the Arm had 
been in the world above thirty 
hours. I never saw a Child so 
mangled in my life. The Mid-
wife seem'd to have more Cou-
rage than Judgment. The Wo-
man likewise received great 
|P_84
hurt; but taking my advice she 
recover'd. I heard from her 
every other day, till she was out 
of danger. I could not constant-
ly attend her, it being eleven 
miles from me, and very bad 
roads. 

I should not have mention'd 
this error of the Midwife's, had 
it not been to caution others 
against attempting such Deli-
veries without knowledge. I 
told her, if she had proceeded 
in a regular manner, as soon as 
her Waters broke, to have search'd 
for the Feet, she might have 
turn'd it, and deliver'd the Wo-
man, without mangling the 
Child, or injuring the Mother. 
She acknowledg'd what I said 
was very just; and that she 
would not proceed so rashly for 
the future.
