[}I.
Of the Nature, Causes, Difference, 
and Symptoms of the Gravel and Stone.}]
THE Disease of the Stone, either in 
the Kidneys or the Bladder, and 
that of the Gout, which are nearly 
related, are two of the most cruel 
and inexorable Tyrants that persecute the 
Race of Mankind: So great is their Vio-
lence, and so unextinguished their Fury, that 
they afflict the unhappy Patients with such 
frequent and insufferable Tortures, as make 
Life an undesirable Possession, and rather a 
Burthen too hard to bear, than a State of 
Satisfaction and Enjoyment. And had not 
the All-wise Divine Author, planted in our 
Nature, so strong an Aversion to Death and 
Dissolution, it is highly probable that many, 
grown utterly impatient of undergoing such 
|P_2
a Weight of Misery, would lay Hands upon 
themselves, and soon put an End to their 
Calamities and their Lives together, the 
Grievance or the first to much over-balancing 
the Pleasure of the last. Some, it is true, of 
these forlorn Creatures, have endeavoured to 
ease themselves by adventuring on these tra-
gical Expedients, and, no doubt, Multitudes 
more would follow their Example, did not 
a Principle of Religion among Christians, 
and a powerful Instinct of Self-Preservation 
among all Men, controul their Impatience, 
and prevent Self-execution: Nor is it a Won-
der they should prefer the Shades and Tran-
quility or the Grave, to the Heats and In-
quietudes of such acute Diseases. 

But it must be allowed, that of this Pair 
so near y allied, the Stone and the Gout, the 
first is the most terrible, and distinguished 
for its Fierceness and Cruelty. This Lictor 
and Minister of Death, inflicts, above all 
others, the sharpest and most insufferable 
Tortures: What a melancholy Scene! What 
a moving Spectacle of mortal Nature is it, 
to see the unhappy Patient extended on the 
Rack, groaning and crying out in Agonies 
of Distress and unspeakable Torment: E'er 
Night is half spent, he wishes for Day; when 
Day appears, he longs for Night; Distracted 
|P_3
with his Sufferings, he lies wakeful, count-
ing the Hours, any one of which, when 
protracted and multiplied by raging Misery, 
seems a numerous Train, so sluggish and 
unprogressive does Time grow under griev-
ous Sufferings. He changes his Pillow, but 
not his Pain; new-makes his Bed, but keeps 
his old Inquietudes, and though he often 
turns from Side to Side, he never leaves his 
Agonies behind: They, hapless State! know 
no Cessation or Interruption: If they some-
times remit and abate their Violence, they 
soon recover their Strength, rekindle their 
Rage, and insult the Patient with as great 
Fury as before. It must therefore be a com-
mendable Action, and becoming an Æscu-
lapian worthy to endeavour, with all his 
Might, to repel or disable this Plague that 
so much infests Mankind; and therefore ac-
cordingly I have undertaken to assist those 
who have already attacked this Pest with 
Skill and Vigour: For this is not the Work 
of a single Aggressor, but as in hunting down 
a Forest Beast, or that enormous Bird the 
Ostrich, many Champions unite their Power, 
armed with various Instruments of Death, 
Cutlasses, Lances, Hooks, and Javelins, that 
with different Weapons and mutual Assist-
ance they may subdue the Enemy, or at least 
|P_4
oblige him to retreat; so, as a ready Auxiliary, 
I bring my Forces, such as they are, to join 
those of abler Combatants, in order to quell 
this formidable Enemy, at least to diminish 
his Strength and restrain his Fury. 

As to the Nature of the Disease, there are 
scarce any Part of the Body privileged from 
breeding Stones in their larger Cavities, or 
more minute Interstices, which are, in some 
measure diversified, according to the Nature 
of the Bowels or Organs where they are pro-
duced. They are found sometimes in the 
external Muscles of the Body, as well as in 
the Lungs, the Stomach, the Liver, the Gall- 
Bladder, the Bowels or Contents of the 
Abdomen, as well as in the Tongue, the 
Brain, and even the Blood it self: For seve-
ral credible Authors have affirm'd, that upon 
opening a Vein, small Stones, together with 
the spouting Blood have rush'd into the Re-
ceiver. In all which Nest, the petrifying Prin-
ciples, meeting and embracing each other, 
produce a single Stone, or a Quarry of them 
But this Discourse is confin'd to the Stone in 
the Kidneys, and that in the Bladder, which 
in this Dissertation I shall consider as the same, 
and not as the Disease of a distinct Species 
When it is formed and settled in either Kid-
ney, it is accompanied with various Symptoms 
|P_5
according as it is large or small, smooth or 
rugged, fixed or loose, closely or slightly co-
herent, i. e. hard and solid, or friable and 
porous. 

Of the minute Stone, that is, the Grit and 
Gravel, formed of sandy Rudiments in the 
Kidneys or Bladder, which however are per-
fect Stones, there are three Sorts distinguished 
by their Colour, that is, White, Yellow, and 
Red. White is the native Complexion of 
these little Bodies, Atoms indeed, in respect 
of those of the largest Dimension, as are the 
Sands on the Shore, when compared with 
the Rock at whose Feet they lie: These pri-
mitive Stones are, however, so close and un-
porous, that the Cohesion of their Parts, are 
not to be unclasped and dissolved, but with 
great Difficulty, insomuch that they imitate 
the Hardness of the Diamond, and will po-
lish Glass, like the Dust of that Jewel, as 
celebrated Authors assert; and it facilitates 
our Belief of the indissoluble Structure of 
this Grit, when we reflect on the like Qua-
lity in that called Hour-Glass Sand, which 
is found, by Experience, to be less porous, 
or more solid than Flint; and therefore the 
Operators in Glass have laid aside the first, 
and now employ the last, as Materials for 
their finest Works. But these minute white 
|P_6
Stones, cannot, as I conceive, give nephri-
tick Pains, or a Fit of the Stone, unless a 
Collection or Congeries of them, are involv-
ed or united by some adventitious, mucous, 
slimy, or other anomalous Matter, so as to 
form a Moles or Bulk, large enough to ob-
struct the Mouths or Channels of the Uri-
nary Passages, and that, it is true, may some-
times happen; but, generally speaking, since 
the minute pale Stones are so smooth and 
small, that they may enter with Ease the Ori-
fices of the Urinary Aquaeducts, and passing 
through those Conveyances, may, without 
creating Pain or Trouble, be excluded with 
the common Stream; and though there 
should be a great Quantity of that small in-
coherent Sand, it may, however, without 
Difficulty, flow through the Ureters into the 
Bladder with the serous Current, and toge-
ther with it be discharged. 

As to the Yellow Gravel, it is evident that 
the minute Particles that compose it, are 
stained with that Colour, by the alkalizate or 
lixivial Salts of the Urine, which abounds 
with such Contents: And this Mixture in 
the small Yellow Stones, is the Reason why 
they are less solid, and more dissoluble than 
the White of a purer Composition; which is 
likewise observ'd, and from the same Reason, 
|P_7
in the Stones generated in the Receptacle of 
the Gall, whose Parts have not that strict 
Connexion and close Structure as the White. 

The Red Gravel receives that Complexion, 
from being infected with a little Drop of 
Blood issuing from some lacerated Vein 
where the Gravel lay. 

All these, if they are ragged and uneven, 
may, by pricking, vellicating, or wounding 
the tender Membranes that include them, 
cause either duller and heavier, or more a-
cute Pains, according as they are arm'd with 
more or less pointed Angles whilst they lie 
in the Pelvis or Basin of the Kidneys, and 
there roused and disturbed by the Motion 
of the Body on Foot or Horseback, rub up-
on and fret the neighbouring Membranes; 
and so nephritick Sufferings may arise from 
Gravel, which consists in real and perfect 
Stones, as before observed, though called 
Sand, or a friable, gritty Matter, by Reason 
of their small Dimension. This is the first 
nephritick Symptom before a larger Stone is 
formed, which, however, is vexatious, and 
often attended not only with Pain, but 
much Inquietude, Sickness of the Stomach, 
and a general Disorder of the whole Oeco-
nomy, while the sandy Atoms, that lie heap-
ed up in the Kidneys, are worked and agi-
tated
|P_8
by the Motion of the Back or Loins, 
irritate and gaul their Membranes of exqui-
site Sense during their Confinement in those 
Lodgings. 

It ought to be observed, that there are 
often sound in the Urine of Persons in good 
Health, or at least not much distempered, a 
Red Gravel or Sand, that sticks to the Sides 
of the Urinal or Chamber-pot that receives 
it; but this is not the genuine Gravel, that 
causes nephritick Sufferings, but the Produc-
tion of the Blood in Persons of a scorbutick 
Disposition, or a warm Temperament, and 
is distinguished from the true Gravel in this, 
that the last falls down, immediately after 
the Urine is rendered, to the Bottom of the 
Receiver, whereas the spurious Kind does 
not break off from its Mixture and Union 
with the Urine, till after some Hours standing 
in that Vessel, when it is at length loosed 
from its Embraces, precipitated and thrust 
down by the Cold of the Air, and afterwards, 
if the Urine be gradually heated again, it 
will recover its former Connexion with it, 
which is not the Case of the genuine nephri-
tick Gravel: Besides, there is often observed
 in Persons of such a Constitution, a thin Sub-
stance floating on the Surface of their Urine, 
imitating melted Fat or Grease, but when it 
|P_9
is skimmed off, and dried upon a Paper 
placed in the Sun, it discovers it self to con-
sist of gritty saline Concretions, united to-
gether by some viscous or slimy Bonds. 

If the Stones are of a larger Size than those 
called Sand or Gravel, they affect Humane 
Bodies with yet more painful and afflictive 
Symptoms, and supposing that their Figure 
is unequal, and varied with many Angles; 
then their Points, especially upon bodily 
Motion, vex and vellicate the Repositories 
where they are nested, and as so many sharp 
Thorns in the Sides of the Pelvis, continually 
grieve, prick, or wound their Membranes; 
whence arises the frequent Discharge of 
bloody Urine, a common Symptom of this 
cruel Disease, which, if fresh, and newly let 
out of the Veins, gives the Urine a red Co-
lour, and the Blood is discernable to the 
Sight; but if it has lain, for some Time, ex-
travasate in the Bladder, or if but a few 
Drops stay in that manner in the Kidneys, 
by turning to grumous and coagulated Clots, 
they impart a dark and blackish Tincture to 
the Urine, not unlike to that of Coffee; this 
is a Symptom likewise that often accompa-
nies this Distemper: It is true also, that pale 
limpid Water sometimes attends the Pa-
roxysms of the Stone, like that observed in 
|P_10
Convulsive, Hypocondriacal, and Hysterick 
Passions, and from the same Cause, that is, 
the Spasmodick Disorder or Contraction of 
the System of the Nerves during the Fit. 

Another Symptom, that accompanies the 
Stones last described, is great Sickness of the 
Stomach, Nausea, and frequent Vomitings, 
or Strainings to Vomit; for while the Fibres 
in the Kidneys are grieved, and lacerated by 
the rough Stone or Stones bred and confined 
there, the Suffering is propagated to the Sto-
mach by a Consent of Parts, or Communi-
cation of Nerves, from one of those Bowels 
to the other; and this is so distinguishing a 
Symptom of this Disease in the Kidneys, that 
other Symptoms without this, are not suffi-
cient to induce the Physician to pronounce 
the Distemper the Stone. 

If the Stone in the Kidneys be some Degree 
larger, and likewise jagged, it creates un-
sufferable Pains, while it remains in the Pelvis 
or Basin of the Kidneys, grating and lacera-
ting the enclosing Membrane, or while it 
strives through the Ureters, and wounds the 
Fibres as they make their Way. 

When the Stone formed in the Kidneys is 
grown yet larger, and so disproportioned to 
the Mouth of the Ureter, that it cannot enter, 
even though its Superficies is smooth and 
|P_11
equal, it will obstruct the Orifice of that Tube, 
while it attempts to pass into it, or will stick 
in the Channel of it; and while it continues 
fixed there, as it stops the Current of the Wa-
ter through the Pipe, so it creates exqusite and 
enormous Misery, by distending the sensible 
Membranes; and if it be unequal and ragged, 
it will produce the most afflictive Tortures, 
till it is protruded by Art or Nature through 
the Ureter, and excluded into the Bladder. 
This happens as often as the Stone grows to 
a greater Size than is suitable to the Inlet and 
Passage of that Tube: And the Effect is the 
same if the Stone, though not of a dispropor-
tinate Bulk to pass the Ureter, should how-
ever lye a-cross the Orifice, for then it will 
obstruct the Descent of the Urine, and create 
great Disorder, till it find a proper Position, 
and its Figure is adapted to the Inlet, and then 
it enters and is at last discharged. 

After the Stone has made its Passage through 
the Ureters for some Years, by stretching and 
enlarging the Road so often, it becomes ca-
pacious enough to receive much larger Stones 
than the first, and to let them through into 
the Bladder; so that the Cavity of the Ureter, 
through which they have passed so long, is 
by Degrees sometimes extended to a Finger's 
Breadth, as unquestionable Authors assure us. 
|P_12
The Stone of the Kidneys is likewise consi-
dered as loose or fixed; if as loose and float-
ing, or not adherent to any part of that 
Bowel, but is always attempting to pass the 
Ureters to the Bladder, it produces the pain-
ful Symptoms before described; but if it is 
fixed, it then Nests itself and settles in the Sub-
stance of the Kidneys, where it grows by Ac-
cretion of Parts, and spreads like branching 
Coral through the Body of the Kidney; and 
while it lodges there in this quiet and inactive 
State, the Patient may sometimes feel Heavi-
ness, or a Weight in the Back, which however 
is but an inconsiderable Suffering; and some in 
this Condition have felt no Symptom at 
all, and dyed of other Distempers; and when 
they were, after Death, dissected by the Sur-
geon, a considerable Stone has been discovered, 
propagated through the Kidney, of which 
however the Patient never complained. 

And this was the Case, as I have been in-
formed of the late Lord Mohun's Father, who 
being open'd after he dyed of a Wound re-
ceived in a Duel, a large Stone was discovered 
spreading through the Kidney, of which not-
withstanding in his Life Time he was entirely 
unconscious. I likewise knew an eminent 
Divine, of a very Lean and Unmuscular Con-
stitution, who told me in Conversation, that 
|P_13
suspecting he had a Stone in the Kidneys, tryed 
one Night in Bed, if he could not feel it, and 
by pressing his Loins, much emaciated with 
his long Fingers, he assured me he felt the 
Stone, and then, said he, I reflected it must 
be a large one propagated through that Bow-
el, and therefore that no Medicinal Methods 
should be attempted to break it, lest the Frag-
ments falling into the Pelvis, should stop the 
Passage of the Ureters, and create great Fits 
of the Stone; upon this, said he, I fell asleep, 
and during many Years, thought of it no more, 
till of late some Incident, which he named, 
and I have forgotten, brought again to his 
Mind this Observation, and when he (some 
Years afterwards) Died and was Dissected, 
a large Stone was found in his Kidney, which 
though he felt, as said before, yet lying un-
disturbed and quiet in its Nest, it gave him 
little Uneasiness. 

The Stone we are discoursing of is either 
lighter or heavier, or which is the same thing, 
more porus and friable, or more close and so-
lid. The Particles that compose the first, hang 
together by a slight Connexion, which is easily 
broken and dissolved, like Flocks of frozen 
Snow, the Sides of a Spunge, or the unsolid 
and porus Substance of the Pumice-Stone, 
and these by any internal or external Violence, 
|P_14
or milder Motion, are often separated and 
crumbled into Parts, that drop into the Ureters 
and pass into the Bladder, to be discharged, 
and these Fragments, like the small sandy and 
gritty Stones spoken of before, produce the 
same troublesome Effects. 

I have accounted for the Stones, that owe 
their Production to the Kidneys, and shall now 
pursue their Progress and follow their Course 
to the Bladder. When the Stone generated in 
the Urinary Strainer is discharged by the Ure-
ter into the common Receiver, it too often 
happens, that it acquires so large a Dimension, 
that the Outlet of the Bladder is not wide e-
nough to let it through, and therefore of Ne-
cessity it must remain imprisoned there, where 
by the Accession of new petrifying Particles, 
and gritty Matter continually descending from 
the Kidneys, and adhering to it, its Size is gra-
dually augmented, till it is yet more incapable 
of being excluded, where if it is loose and float-
ing, it produces many grievous Symptoms; 
for though it be only smooth and equal, and 
so does not lacerate the Bladder, yet it will 
often, as it plays against the Neck of it, and 
attempts to pass through, stop the Mouth of 
the Aquaeduct, that conveys away the Urine, 
and by so doing, produces very great Torment, 
while the Bladder is excessively distended, and 
|P_15
unable to discharge the enclosed Deluge; and 
if the Stone be uneven and rugged, it will by 
goading and wounding the encompassing 
Membranes, create exquisite Pain and bloody 
Urine, and by long repeated Cruelties of this 
Kind, it frequently forms an Ulcer in the lace-
rated Part, which is discovered by the Secre-
tion of putrid Matter mingled with the Urine; 
for when it has stood some Hours, a pale slimy 
Sediment is precipitated to the Bottom of the 
Receiver, like the Excrement of the Nose, or 
the Whites of Eggs, and is distinguished, from 
the like Matter that descends to the Bladder, 
from an Ulcer in the Kidneys, by the Odour, 
which is strong and faetid, if the purulent Mat
ter comes from an Ulcer in the Bladder, but 
that derived from one in the Kidneys has no 
such offensive Smell, as said above. And the 
Case is the same when an Ulcer arises in the 
Kidneys or the Neck of the Bladder, not from 
the Stone but from other Causes, such as pro-
duce Ulcers in the Lungs, in the Intestines, or 
other internal Parts, that is, the Impurities 
and incongruous Particles, which by Reason 
of their disproportionate Size and Figure, can-
not slide through the strait Passages of the 
Glands, but stick in them, till more of the like 
Nature entangled there, encrease the Obstruc-
tion and swell the Parts, whence by Degrees 
|P_16
they are inflamed, putrify, and by their Dis-
ruption, form an Ulcer; and when this Disease 
is produced in the Kidneys or the Bladder, the 
putrid Contents issuing from them, and toge-
ther with the Urine excluded into the Re-
ceiver, shew themselves, as I have said, by 
their viscous and ropy Quality, and are di-
versified by their faetid or inoffensive Smell: 
And it should be observed, that their mucous 
and slimy Nature, distinguishes these Contents 
from others, that proceed from a scorbutick 
or unhealthful Habit of Body, when much 
white, mealy, and light Matter appears in the 
Sediment, and which being without Con-
nexion, upon shaking the Glass will rise and 
float incoherent in the Urine, but unslimy, as 
well as without Faetor: This therefore, as I 
have said, does not proceed from any internal 
Ulcer, but is a Defect arising from some irre-
gular and depraved State of the Blood, that 
communicates with its Serum such Matter 
to the Kidneys. 

The Suppression of Urine, occasioned by a 
Stone too large to pass the Urethra, is not at-
tended with Sickness and Vomiting, as when 
a Stone sticks in its Passage through the Ure-
ters, there being no Communication of Nerves 
between the Bladder and the Stomach, to con-
vey the Sensations from one to the other. But 
|P_17
exquisite and grievous Pains however attend it 
from the Distention of the Bladder, as I have 
said, and sometimes a smaller Stone, that has 
entered the Mouth of the Urethra, yet being 
too great to slide through, stops near the En-
trance, or in the Middle, and creates a total 
Suppression of Urine, as well as great Torment. 

I have now accounted for the Nature, Pro-
perties, and Symptoms of this Disease, and have 
likewise in carrying on my Discourse, inter-
mixed an Ennumeration of its various Kinds, 
discriminated by the Receptacles, where the 
Stone is contained, or by its different Colour 
or various Shape and Figure; and now I shall 
proceed to search into the Causes of it. 

The remote, antecedent Cause of the Stone, 
is a defect in the digestive Faculty of the 
Stomach, or that of the Blood, or nervous 
Juices, whence such Impurities and feculent 
Portions remain, as produce the Coagulations 
and Concrescencies, that become the Founda-
tion of the Stone, whose Rudiments and pri-
mitive Materials, consist in a close Combina-
tion of a volatile in a superior, and acid Salt 
in an inferiour Proportion. That these two 
are the petrifying Principles, is known by 
Experience, that shews us that this is the Effect 
of Acids and Alkalies meeting together; as for 
Example, Juice of Lemon, and Salt of Tartar;
|P_18
Let it be supposed then, that from the inordi-
nate and depraved Concoctions before-named, 
such hard Coalitions, slimy Coagulations, or 
cretaceous Confederacies should be left be-
hind, and it is easy to conceive how, when 
yet more hardened and prepared in the Blood, 
they may by the Power of the urinous Salts 
in the Kidneys, be soon converted into gritty, 
sandy Atoms, which, clustring together, and 
cohering, form at length a Stone of the lowest 
Size; that by the daily Accession of new simi-
lar Particles, acquires a far greater Dimension 
in the Kidneys, and yet a greater after its 
Descent from that Bowel to the Bladder; for 
while it is detained, from being too large to be 
excluded, it has more Room to receive Aug-
mentation, whilst constantly fed by the sandy 
Rivulets, that empty themselves through the 
Outlets of the Ureters into that Cistern, where 
it grows by such Accretion, till sometimes it 
becomes exceeding large: Thus petrified Fos-
sils and Flints in the Earth, as well as rotten, 
Sticks and Pieces of Wood turned to Stone, 
owe their Growth, as well as Production, to 
lapidescent or stony Particles, that continually 
accede to, and strictly embrace the former col-
lected Materials; But as to the intrinsick Na-
ture of #he Stone bred in living Creatures, and 
those last named, that is, Minerals and Vege-
|P_19
there is a vast Difference; for the greatest 
Part of the first are formed of volatile Salts, or 
Animal Alkalies, but the other are not com-
posed of any such Ingredients. It is truly re-
marked, that those who are obnoxious to the 
Stone, are generally of a hot Constitution, as 
it is likewise observed of gouty Patients, by 
which means their Blood is more inclined to 
breed cretaceous, hard, and gritty Combina-
tions, which by a certain Degree of Heat, 
are soon advanced into proper Materials for 
the Gout and Stone, Diseases so nearly related, 
that they are easily convertible into each other. 
But of these Subjects I have discoursed at 
large in my Treatise of the Gout, to which 
I refer the Reader. 

When the Seeds or Principles of the Stone, 
that is, the viscous, tough or sandy Concre-
tions, not to be dissolved and separated from 
the Blood, bearing however a Figure and Di-
mension proper to enter the papillary Glands, 
the Strainers in the Kidneys, they are there yet 
more indurated, and acquire a gritty and sabu-
lous Constitution; though even in the Blood 
itself, before the Serum is separated from it by 
the secretory Glands, small Stones are often 
formed, as they are in all the Parts of the 
Body, as before observed. 

|P_20
It is remarkable that those Countries, that 
lye upon the River Rhine and the Northern 
Parts of France, who drink a thin, sharp, 
pale Wine, which is more replenished with 
Tarcar than other Fruits of the Vine, con-
cocted by a hotter Sun, are most obnoxious 
to the Stone in the Kidneys: For such Wines 
convey to the Blood in great Plenty, a Sort of 
petrifying Fluid, whose redundant acid Parti-
cles, before their Nature is changed to an Al-
kali by the active Principles of the Blood, 
meeting and combining with the volatile Salts 
there, the Result is a hard and tartarous Pro-
duction, easily formed into a Stone. 

The voluptuous Life of those that eat and 
drink deliciously every Day, cannot but ad-
minister to the Blood, the Seeds and Principles 
of the Stone, in Constitutions disposed and 
prepared for that Distemper: For these costly 
and luxurious Meats and Drinks, excessively 
and constantly ingested, being unequal to the 
digest ve Power of the Stomach, fill it with a 
Load of Crudities and unconcocted Foods; 
which transmitted by the Ministry of the 
lacteal Passages to the Veins, communicate to 
the Blood, not only great Plenty of noxious 
Impurities, but likewise a rich Chyle, abun-
dant in volatile Salts, with such a Proportion 
of Acids, as are apt to create this Distemper. 

|P_21
A sedentary and inactive Life, especially 
when the Persons are of a vigorous and hot 
Complexion, much promotes the Production 
of the Stone; for while the Blood runs lazy and 
unagitated in its Channels, for want of due 
Labour and Exercise of the Limbs to push on 
its Streams with due Celerity, it is easy to 
conceive how the crude and impure Parts run 
into various Concrescencies and Coagulations. 
On the contrary, when due Activity, either by 
the Labour of the Hands, or by riding, or o-
ther Exercises of the Body, the Motion of the 
Blood is accelerated, it is obvious to appre-
hend, that by the Rencounters and mutual Col-
lisions of the Parts dashing and rubbing upon 
each other, they are broken, divided and atte-
nuated, till they become so minute and so well 
mixed, that the tough, slimy, and yet harder 
Combinations are unlocked and dissolved, by 
which means the Seeds and Rudiments of the 
Stone are prevented, and the Cause removed: 
And therefore in this Case, as in the Gout, 
the sedentary Lawyer; the over-thoughtful 
Person; the hard Student; and the inactive, 
indolent, and voluptuous Gentleman, are ob-
noxious to this grievous Distemper, as are 
likewise Men of covetous Tempers; while the 
laborious Husbandman, and Mechanick, the 
daily Traveller, and indefatigable Sportsman, 
|P_22
are seldom attacked and tortured by it: For 
these keep the Body in a Healthful State, 
while their repeated Exercise helps their di-
gestive Faculties to do their Duty, and refine 
the Blood, by a constant Expulsion of inordi-
nate and incongruous Humours. 

[}II.
The Method of Curing the 
Gravel and Stone.}]
FIRST, of the lowest Degree of this Dis-
ease, that is, the small Sand-like Gri#t, 
either White, Red, or Yellow, which though 
very minute, yet are true Stones, and distinct 
from the scorbutick Red Matter, that does 
not separate and fall down from the Urine, 
till after some Hours standing, and then is pre-
cipitated by the Impression of the Cold from 
the Ambient Air, as above described. The 
Cure of this Distemper, consists in the carrying 
off the sabulous and sandy Atoms, and pre-
venting the Generation of more, and so cut-
ting off the Supplies, that use to fill the Room 
of the forther, that are discharged with the 
|P_23
Urine: And it is highly necessary to attempt 
this, lest otherwise the small Stones, continu-
ing undisturbed, should unite and adhere to 
each other, and receiving gradual Augmenta-
tion, from new Particles daily arriving, should 
grow to a Stone of great Bulk, and become 
incapable of passing the Ureters, or at least 
without great Difficulty and Pain; and when 
they slide through and drop into the Bladder, 
should contract there a large Size as before de-
scribed. For it is highly probable, that the 
Stone is very seldom originally generated in 
that Receptacle, and that all, or at least the 
far greatest Part found there, descend thither 
from the Kidneys, and receive their Encrease 
from the sandy and gritty Supplies, transmitted 
to it through the Ureters. It has therefore 
been an unhappy Neglect, committed by some 
Patients, that though they have long perceived 
a considerable Quatity of Gravel discharged 
with their Urine, and have felt the Trouble 
and Uneasiness of it in their Kidneys, have 
however, taken little Care to clear them of 
these gritty Materials, and prevent the breed-
ing of more; from which Omission, at length, 
Stones of a bigger Bulk, always painful and 
often fatal, have been produced. 

It is therefore evidently the Interest of all 
Persons, when they observe that a Quantity of 
|P_24
such Sand and Gravel, the Rudiments and Mo-
ther of bigger Stones, is excluded with the 
Urine from the Bladder, to endeavour, by pro-
per Means, to free the Kidneys from these noxi-
ous Inhabitants, and prevent the Generation 
of new Supplies; and in the first Place, it is 
requisite to convey away the Gravel, that is 
already bred, for which Purpose the following 
Method is most efficacious. 

First Purgatives. 

Take over Night, going to Bed, of Elixir 
 Salutis, three Spoonfuls; and the next 
Morning, drink a Quart or three Pints 
of purging Mineral Waters, such as those 
of Epsom, Dulledge, Acton, Northal, &c. 
 And at Night going to Bed, 

Take of Milk-Water, two Ounces; com-
pound Water of Horse-radish, half an 
Ounce; twelve Drops of liquid Lauda-
num, and three Drachms of Diacodium; 
make it a Draught: repeat both Medi-
cines every other Day and Night, for 
three Times. 

After an Interval of three Weeks do the 
same, and sooner, if the Symptoms of the 
Gravel call for it. 

|P_25
Or, Drink alone, two Quarts of such purg-
ing Waters several Days, and then rest.

The Reason why these Waters are very be-
neficial for the Purpose intended, is, that a 
considerable Part of them pass by Urine, and 
in their Passage through the Kidneys, wash 
away in their Current the Sand and Gravel, 
and suffer them not to lodge there, till they 
grow to a Stone of a large Size: And 'tis the 
same in respect of the Bladder; for the same 
Flood that rushes down through the Ureters, 
carries off the Gritt from the Receiver, and 
expels it with the Urine. 

Diureticks, to be employed in the Intervals 
of purging, for the same Purpose, are such 
as follow. 

Take of Roots of Chervil, Stone Parsley, 
Eringo, Fennel, Sorrel, each half an 
Ounce; of Seeds of Burdock, Anise, and 
sweet Fennel, each a Drachm; of Juni-
per Berries, three Drachms; boil these 
Ingredients, in three Pints of Spring-
Water, to a Quart; add to it, a Drachm 
of purified Nitre; strain it, and add a 
Pint of Rhenish Wine: Drink a Quar-
ter of a Pint Morning and Evening. 

Or, Take Millepedes alive and washed, 
fifty, bruise them in a Mortar, with a 
|P_26
Quarter of a Pint of Rhenish Wine, and 
four Ounces of compound Horse-radish 
Water; make a strong Expression for a 
Draught, to be taken twice a Day.

But the most effectual Diuretick for carry-
ing off Gravel, and clearing the Parts afflicted 
with it, are mineral unpurging Waters, such 
as those of the Bath, Tunbridge, the Spaw,
and other Chalybeate Springs: For these, 
rushing with a plentiful Tide through the uri-
nary Organs where the Gravel is lodged as 
well as generated, disturbs its several Nests, 
and rolls along in its Stream, the Sand-beds it 
meets in its Way, till at length they are dis-
charged in the Urine. But this is not the only 
Advantage, that attends the drinking co-
piously Chalybeate Waters; for besides this, it 
very much contributes the laying the Axe to 
the Root of the Disease, and preventing the 
Generation of such petrifying Seeds, as shall 
be shewn afterwards. There are other diure-
tick Remedies useful in this Distemper; as a 
Mixture of Water, French Brandy, and Juice 
of Lemon, called Punch, if made small, and 
not intoxicating, though taken in a conside-
rable Quantity. Juice or Syrup of Lemons; 
Syrup of Marsh-mallows; and fresh Oil of 
Sweet Almonds; of each an equal Portion, 
|P_27
mixed and beat together, with as much Sugar 
as is sufficient to give them a Consistency, 
taken to a Spoonful or two often in a Day, is 
very beneficial; so is a Spoonful or two of 
compound Juniper-Water of Cologne, or
Holland, drank now and then in a Glass of 
White-wine; add to these Remedies, the ex-
ercise of the Body, by riding sometimes on a 
hard trotting Horse, sometimes by hurrying 
in a Coach over paved Stones, or other rugged 
and uneven Ground, (if the Patient can bear 
it) which by the repeated working and Con-
cussion of the Back, move and dislodge the 
Gravel in the Kidneys, and force it thence 
into the Bladder, whence it is excluded with 
the Water. 

Now to prevent the Production of little 
Stones or Gravel, all those Remedies are re-
quired as most effectual, that have an opera-
tive Vertue, to loose and disengage all viscous 
and tough Coagulations, and dissolve the Co-
hesion and Structure of cretaceous and gritty 
Coalitions, whence small Stones and Gravel 
are created, some in the Blood, and others in 
the urinary Strainers. This is indeed a Matter 
of the greatest Importance in this Case; for if 
this is effected, the formidable and pernicious 
Disease will be crushed in Embrio, and not suf-
fered to arrive at a mature State. I shall there-
|P_28
set down the Medicines, endowed with 
the greatest Force, for procuring this End. 

It is easy to see that those Remedies, that 
restore the Blood when depraved, to its native 
Temperament, and keep it in that just and sa-
lutary Constitution, which specifially belongs 
to this Animal Fluid, are in general to be cho-
sen; and in this Case in particular, those are 
to be insisted on, that are most capable of dis-
joyning and separating the associated, viscous, 
and sandy Particles, that conspire to the For-
mation of a Stone, and so to attenuate and 
refine them, that they may easily incorporate 
with the Blood, and produce an uniform and 
equal Mixture. 

And for this Purpose, Chalybe#te Medicines, 
prepared by Art or Nature, are the most pre-
ferable: And since Patients afflicted with this 
Disease, are commonly of a hotter Constitu-
tion than others, those Preparations that have 
the least Sulphur left in their Composition, are 
most beneficial to them; such as the Salt of 
Steel, or the Tincture of it in Wine: But a-
bove all, mineral Waters, impregnated with 
Steel in Embrio, are in this Case most cele-
brated, which not only dilute and attemper 
the Blood, and carry off in their Current the 
sandy and petrifying Materials, as before ex-
plained, but likewise by their active Vertue, 
|P_29
animate, ferment, and exalt the Blood, break 
the Cohesion of the knotty and cretaceous 
Seeds of the Stone, and by wresting the Parti-
cles from each others Embraces, prevent the 
engendering of this Disease, by the Confede-
racy of such Impurities. So that these salu-
tary Springs, are not only highly useful in free-
ing the Veins from immiscible and hurtful 
Matter, cleansing the Urinary Channels, and 
rolling away in their Flood, the Gravel lodged 
in the Cavities, through which their Waters 
make their Way, but they likewise very much 
contribute to the Recovery of a just Crasis, or 
Constitution of Blood, by destroying the Prin-
ciples and Rudiments of this Disease, 'ere yet 
they combine in a Stone of large Size, and 
reach a mature State, which they effect in the 
Manner described. 

But if hard and gravelly Materials, associate 
and unite in the Kidneys, by a slight Structure, 
and are rather entangled one with another, and 
hang together like a piece of Spunge, Hoar-
Frost, or a Flake of Snow, than strictly co-
here, whence they become very porus and 
friable; or if when more closely complicated 
and connected, they grow to a greater Bulk, 
and create great Pain either in the Kidneys or 
the Ureters, by grating the Membranes with 
their unequal and ragged Figure in their Pas-
|P_30
sage, or by their too large and disproportionate 
Size, stop at the Entrance, or in their Way 
through these Tubes, in such Cases, the proper 
Remedies do remove them from the Kidneys, 
and oblige them to pass the Uteters into the 
Bladder, are such as these. 

[}III. 
How to remove a Fit of the 
Gravel, or Stone. }]
Take three or four Spoonfuls of Elixir Sa-
lutis, or of the Tincture or Infusion of 
Sena and Rhubarb and Anniseeds, over 
Night, and a Quart of purging Mineral-
Water the next Morning, and the Night 
following take this Draught, 

Of Milk-Water, two Ounces; of compound 
Horse-radish-Water, three Drachms; of 
crude Opium colated, a Grain and half; 
Syrup of Marsh-mallows, half an Ounce; 
make it a Draught: And if the Stone or 
Gravel, be not removed, but the Fit con-
tinues, take the next Morning, two 
Quarts of the same purging Waters, 
either Epsom, Dulledge, Acton, &c. and 
the Night following, the same composing 
|P_31
Draught, and so the next Morning and 
Night, for three Times, during the Fit; 
and if notwithstanding, the Paroxysm 
is still prolonged, then let the Patient 
take the following Draught, going to 
Bed, every Night, if the Pains are vio-
lent, or otherwise every other Night. 

Take of Oil of Sweet-Almonds, and Ounce; 
of the pectoral Decoction, a Quarter of 
a Pint; of Syrup of Meconium, ten 
Drachms; make a Draught. 

Take also such oily and diuretick Medicines 
as follow. 

Take of Oil of Sweet-Almonds, and Lin-
seed, drawn without Fire, each an 
Ounce; of Syrup of Lemons and Marsh-
mallows, each ten Drachms; of Saffron, 
a Scruple; of fine Sugar, as much as is 
sufficient; let it all be well mixed in a 
marble Mortar, and made a Linctus. 
Let the Patient take a Spoonful or two 
often in a Day and Night. 

Small Punch likewise, especially if made 
with Spaw-Water, is useful to push on the 
Stone, or Gravel, when either of them sticks 
in the Ureters, and to clear the Kidneys of 
the Beds of Sand collected there. 

|P_32
Juniper-Water, especially that of Cologne,
or Holland, and the diuretick Apozem, 
above set down, are beneficial. 

To be more particular, let the Patient in 
the Paroxysm, that eludes the Force of the 
forementioned Remedies, take the following. 

Take of Flowers of Camomile, two Hand-
fuls; Roots of Marsh-mallows, six 
Drachms; of wild Carrot-Seed, half an 
Ounce; of Venice Turpentine, dissolved 
with the White of an Egg, three Drachms; 
of the Electuary of Hiera cum Agarick, 
six Drachms; make it a Clyster. 

Or, Take of the common emollient Decocti-
on, twelve Ounces; adding to the Ingre-
dients Juniper-Berries, six Drachms; 
Seeds of the wild Carrot, three Drachms; 
dissolve in it of Lenitive Electuary, ten 
Drachms; use it for a Clyster. 

Let one of these Clysters be given every 
Day, for three or four Times. 

For easing the Paroxysm, it will likewise be 
very Advantagious, for the Patient to sit up 
to the Waste, in a Bath of Lukewarm Water, 
and repeat it two or three Times, or in a 
medicated Bath, which may be made thus.

|P_33
Take of the Leaves of Mallows, Marsh-
mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, each 
three Handfuls; Flowers of Camomile, 
Melilot, and Elder, each two Handfuls; 
Tops of Camomile, two Handfuls; Juni-
per-Berries, six Ounces; of Linseed, and 
Fenugreek-Seed, each two Ounces; boil 
all in a sufficient Quantity of Spring-
Water, and let the Patient sit in it 
Lukewarm, up to the Waste, in a Ba-
thing Tub. 

In this Case also, there are vast Varieties of 
Remedies, prescribed by celebrated Authors, 
as Fomentations, Liniments, Plaisters, &c. 
to be externally applied, which notwithstand-
ing, are little availing for removing a Fit of 
the Stone, or Gravel: The most effectual, are 
certainly the Use of purging Mineral Waters, 
three or four Times, and taking at Night, af-
ter their Operation, a Grain and half of Opium, 
as before-mentioned, or an equivalent Quan-
tity of liquid Laudanum, that is, about 
thirty Drops.

But in Case that Method should not suc-
ceed, the next most valuable Medicines are 
Pills made of Venice-Turpentine, or rather 
Chios, taken to the Quantity of a Scruple, alone, 
or mixed with an equal Part of Rhubarb. 

|P_34
Or, Thus,—Take of Venice, or Chios-Tur-
pentine, four Scruples; of Rhubarb, a 
Drachm; of Salt of Tartar, half a 
Drachm; Cinnamon, half a Scruple; of 
Balsamick Syrap, as much as will make 
a Mass, to be formed into Pills of ordi-
nary Size; take four every other Day, 
at Bed Time.

For the same End, Emulsions are condu-
cive, such as these, 

Of Sweet-Almonds blanched, number fif-
teen; of Seeds of Melons, Pumpions, 
Violets, each two Drachms; bruise them 
together in a marble Mortar, pouring 
on them, gradually, a Quart of Barley-
Water; strain it for use; drink often of 
it, a Quarter of a Pint, or six Ounces, 
Day or Night. 

Or, Take of Seeds of Violets, three 
Drachms; of Seeds of Pumpions, Me-
lons, white Poppies, each two Drachms; 
eight blanched Sweet-Almonds; bruise 
them together in a Mortar, and pour 
upon them, Milk-Water, and Corn 
Poppy-Water, each a Pint, strain it, 
and make it an Emulsion to be drank as 
the others 

|P_35
Oily Medicines, are likewise very useful, as 
they envelop and soften the acid and acrimo-
nious Juices, and promote the Expulsion of 
the Stone, as thus, 

Take two Spoonfuls of Linseed-Oil, newly 
drawn, without Fire, twice a Day. 

Or, Take new Oil of Sweet-Almonds, and 
Linseed-Oil, drawn without Fire, each 
an Ounce; of Syrup of Marsh-mallows, 
and Violets, of each six Drachms; of 
Syrup of Lemons, half an Ounce; of 
Saffron, rubbd fine, half a Scruple; mix 
them well to make a Linctus: Take a 
Spoonful often, shaking it well. 

Or, Take an Ounce of fresh Oil of Sweet-
Almonds, in a Quarter of a Pint of the 
Decoction for the Syrup of Marsh-mal-
lows, and repeat it frequently. 

Riding in a Coach, or on Horseback, in 
rough unequal Ground, or our paved Streets, 
conduces much to the Discharge of the Stone, 
or Gravel, when either one or t'other sticks 
in the Ureter, or Pelvis, if the Patient can 
endure it. 

And while these Remedies are made Use of, 
opiate Medicines must be given, mingled with 
them, or alone, to abate the spasmodick Con-
|P_36
traction of the tender Membranes, and give 
Ease to the disordered and afflicted Spirits, that 
they being lulled to Rest and Quiet, may cease 
their convulsive Grasps, and the mean Time 
the Stone, or Gravel, sollicited by city smooth 
Remedies, slippery and gentle Diureticks, may 
slide through the Ureters, and drop, or pass, 
into the Bladder without Resistance. 

Take of crude Opium, dissolved and strained, 
a Grain and half, or two Graine; of the 
pectoral Decoction, a Quarter of a Pint; 
Syrup of Lemons, three Drachms; make 
it a Draught, to be taken at Night, or 
at any Time when the Pain is violent, 
and repeat it as the Symptoms shall re-
quire. 

Or, Take of Cinnabar of Antimony, half a 
Scruple; Crabbs-Eyes and Coral, of each 
six Grains; Laudanum Opiatum, a Grain 
and half; make it a Powder, to be taken 
at the Draught now prescribed. 

If the Patient is disposed to Vomiting, or 
straining to Vomit, let him take two Spoon-
fuls of the following Mixture, and repeat it 
four or five times, once in four Hours. 

Take of Mint-Water, or Barley Cinnamon-
Water, two Ounces; of Juice of Lemons, 
|P_37
two Ounces; of Salt of Wormwood, 
a Drachm and half; of Laudanum, a 
Grain and half; make a Mixture. 

For easing the Pain, and facilitating the 
Passage of the Stone, or Gravel, various diu-
retick Remedies are recommended, by emi-
nent Physicians, the following Decoction of 
Forrestus, is for this Purpose, much cried up. 

Take of Seeds of Mallows, Marsh-mal-
lows, each two Drachms and half; of 
fat lenten Figgs, cut and sliced, num-
ber nine; Sebestens in number seven; 
boil these Ingredients in three Quarts 
of Water, to three Pints: This soft 
and slippery Decoction, like that for 
making Syrup of Marsh-mallows, or 
the pectoral Decoction, in the London
Dispensatory, may be improved by o-
ther diurclick Ingredients, (viz.) Seeds 
of Burdock, Roots of Fennel, Violets, 
Eringo, wild Carrots, Juniper-
Berries, &c. 

|P_38
In a Fit of the Stone likewise, the De-
coction of the Flowers of Camomile, is 
much applauded by some worthy Phy-
sicians; and that of the Water-Lilly; 
and if some Drops of sweet Spirit of 
Salt, or Vitriol, were added to each 
Draught of such diuretick Apozems, 
their Force would be still improved. 

[}IV.
To preserve from, or prevent the 
return of Fits of the Stone, or 
Gravel, when the Pa-
roxysms cease. }]
Gentle Purgatives of Sena, Rhubarb, 
Elixir Salutis, &c. taken once in a 
Month or six Weeks, are beneficial, as they 
cleanse the Stomach, and their appending 
Roads from their Impurities, and the crude 
and unconcocted Remains of the Foods ingest-
ed; but the best Way is frequently to use purg-
|P_39
Mineral Waters; and in the Intervals, diu-
retick and alterative Remedies, should be 
taken, such as these that follow. 

Take of the Pulp of candied Citron-Peel, 
and of the Root of Marsh-mallows, each 
an Ounce; of Species Dialthaeae, and Di-
atragacanth frigid, each a Drachm and 
half; of Crabbs-Eyes, two Drachms; of 
the Seeds of Purslain, and white Pop-
pies, each a Drachm; of the Fruit of 
Alkakengi, two Scruples; of Gumm Ara-
bick, two Drachms; Syrup of Marsh-
mallows, as much as will make an Elec-
tuary; take the Quantity of a large 
Nutmeg, or small Chesnut, twice a Day, 
Drinking after it, a Quarter of a Pint 
of the Decoction for the Syrup of Marsh-
mallows. 

But for cleansing the Kidneys, and carry-
ing off the Sand and gritty Concrescences, 
lest by daily Augmentation, they should at 
last form a larger Stone, slippery and oily Re-
medies, and Turpentine, such as mentioned 
above, Whey, and above all, unpurging Mi-
neral Waters of all Kinds, but chiefly the Cha-
ybeate, such as Tunbridge, must be relied 
upon; or the Islington Waters, call'd New-
|P_40
Tunbridge. Millepedes, are also a good Diu-
retick in this Case: But I have above treated 
on this Subject, where I have discoursed on the 
Gravel, and small sandy Concretions, which 
are the minutest real Stones, and the Seeds 
and Rudiments, that by their Consluence 
and Coherence, produce those of a greater Dimen-
sion, and to that Discourse I refer the Reader; 
for the true Method of preserving the Patient 
from the Return of his Paroxysms, is to pre-
vent the Generation of such fabulous Mate-
rials, out of which the Stone is made, or to 
carry them off before they have formed such 
large Bodies. 

It is very useful in a Paroxysm of the Stone, 
to go into a Bath of Spring-Water moderately 
warm, which by stopping Sweat and Perspi-
ration, and soothing the Spirits, relaxing and 
dilating the Fibres, promotes Urine, and 
therefore the Protrusion and Expulsion of the 
Stones, that hang or stick in the Ureters 
which after they have acquired a considerable 
Magnitude, will notwithstanding strive and 
make their Way for a while through those 
Tubes, which are much stretched and enlarged 
by being the beaten Road for Stones to pass 
from the Kidneys to the Bladder; yet at length 
they encrease to such a Size, that when they 
have entered the Orifice of the Ureter, and 
|P_41
are incapable of proceeding farther, they plug 
up the Passage, and stop the Current of the 
Urine; and if afterwards another Stone of such 
a disproportionate Size, should fall from the 
Kidney into the Mouth of the other Tube, a 
total Suppression of Urine and Death in a 
short Time, that is, in ten or eleven Days, are 
the Consequence; for a total and destructive 
Stoppage of the Urine, cannot arise from the 
Obstruction of one Ureter; for Nature that has 
framed so many double Organs for other Func-
tions, two Eyes, two Ears, two Jugular Veins, 
two Lobes of the Lungs, &c. that if one of 
these Instruments should be lost or become 
defective, the other, at least in a great Measure, 
might perform the Office of both; so it has 
evidently for the more certain and effectual 
Secretion of the Urine, provided a pair of Con-
veyances, one in each Kidney, that if one be 
entirely disabled and stopped up, the other 
may do double Duty, and discharge the Por-
tion of Serum, that used to run through the 
other Aquaeduct. It is therefore evident to a 
Demonstration, that no total Suppression of 
the Urine can happen, where both the Ureters 
are not entirely stopped; and it is hard to con-
ceive how at any Time two Stones should at 
once fall down, one from each Kidney, and 
stop in the same Instant, each of those Organs 
|P_42
of Separation: If therefore a full Stoppage of 
Water happens, and neither of the Ureters was 
before that Time obstructed, it is most agree-
able to Reason, that we should assign another 
Cause of that Event, that is, a paralytick Im-
potence of the secretory small Tubes and pa-
pillary Glands, which strain the Serum from 
the Blood, through the Kidneys and Ureters, 
into the Bladder; for if these secretory Tubes 
by a Paralysis affecting the Spirits residing in 
them, quite lose their Tension and falling flat 
together close up their Foramina, or Passages, 
no Serum can be longer separated from the 
Blood, or conveyed into the Receptacle of 
the Urine; and this will prove as effectual and 
adaequate a Cause of a total Obstruction of 
Urine, as if both the Ureters were compleatly 
stopped by the falling of two Stones of dis-
proportionate Size into their Mouths. And 
this was the Case of an illustrious Person, one 
of the first Rank of the English Nobility, who 
having for several Years been afflicted with 
the Gout, one Day felt a severe Pain in one of 
his Shoulders, which after some Time ceased 
to afflict him; but he had not been long at 
Ease, when the Flow of his Urine was entirely 
interrupted, and continued so to the eleventh 
Day, when the noble Patient expired, not-
withstanding all the Means and Methods that 
|P_43
his Physicians, of whom I had the Honour to 
be one, could direct for his Recovery. Upon 
opening the dead Body there appeared, when 
the K#dneys were divided, some small Stones 
in the Pelvis, and others entangled in the 
Fibres or Strings of the Kidneys, but no Stone 
in the Mouth or Channel of either Ureter; so 
nothing can be more certain, nor more ob-
vious to the meanest Capacity than this, that 
the Stone could not be the Cause of hindring 
the Water from descending into the Bladder, 
no Stone being found in the Ureters, nor in 
the Kidneys, of a Size capable of stopping the 
Tubes before-named; and had there been bred 
in the Kidneys, any Stones of a sufficient Big-
ness, to have compleatly stopped the Ureters, 
yet it must be supposed, as before suggested, 
that two Stones of such a Magnitude fell at 
the same Instant, one into the Orifice of each 
Ureter, else a total Suppression of Urine could 
not have followed; and this must be supposed 
scarce ever to have happened, and is but bare-
ly possible. But de facio, there were no such 
Stoppage found in either Ureter. Yet not-
withstanding one of the Physicians declared 
his Opinion, and obstinately persevered in it, 
that the Suppression of Urine, of which the 
Patient dyed, proceeded from the Stone in 
The Kidneys. 

|P_44
These are the best preservatory Means 
against the Return of this formidable Disease, 
since the true and effectual Way, as mentioned 
above, is either to enable the active Princi-
ples of the Blood to keep the Mass in such an 
equal, regular, and just Mixture, and to refine 
and exalt it to such an healthful State, as may 
prevent the Generation of hard and gritty Con-
crescences, that as they are the Foundation of 
the Stone, so they administer Materials for 
the Superstructure; and for procuring this 
End, the Remedies already enumerated are 
most availing, in as much as they animate 
and enliven the Spirits, refine and elevate the 
Mass of Blood, and dissolve and sever creta-
ceous or sandy Coalitions, by maintaining its 
Circulation with a due Celerity. To these 
may be added such Medicines as subdue the 
acid and acrimonious Quality of the Juices, by 
blunting and smoothing their sharp Points and 
Angles, such as Coral, Crabbs-Eyes, Crabbs-
Claws, Oyster-shells, and other testaceous, ab-
sorbing and correcting Powders, given with 
Asses-Milk, or mixed with other Ingredients 
in Pius or Electuaries; and likewise those, that 
are proper to assist the digestive Faculty of the 
Stomach, to concoct the Foods and Liquors 
it receives, into a wholesome well-laboured 
and duly mixed Mass of Chyle, that the un-
|P_45
and fæculent Parts, the first Seeds 
and Principles which by their Union and 
Coacervation produce the Stone, may be 
prevented. 

The Forms of such Medicines that pro-
mote Digestion in the Stomach, are such 
as these. 

Take of Conserve of Roman Wormwood, of 
candied Citron Peel, or the outward 
yellow Rind of the Orange, each an 
Ounce; of Coral, Crabbs-Eyes, and Pearl, 
each a Drachm; of candied Nutmegs, a 
Drachm and half; of Salt of Wormwood 
and Tartar, each two Scruples; of com-
pound Powder of Wake-Robin, and the 
Leaves of Chamaepitys, each a Drachm 
and half; of the Syrup from candied Nut-
meg, as much as will make an Electuary. 
Take the quantity of a large Nutmeg, 
every Morning and Evening, drink-
ing after it, a Glass of Wormwood-wine, 
or the Infusion of the Root of Gentian, 
or Twenty Drops of the Tincture of Gen-
tian in a Glass of White-wine. 

Or, Take of the Tops of Roman Worm-
wood, and the lesser Centaury, each half a 
Pugil; of the Root of Gentian, and Vir-
|P_46
ginian Snake-root, each a Drachm; of 
Cardamom Seeds, two Scruples; of Cori-
ander Seeds, two Drachms and half; of 
Salt of Tartar a Drachm; infuse all in a 
sufficient Quantity of Spring-Water to 
a Quart; strain it, and add to it, of com-
pound Wormwood, and compound Gen-
tian Water, each an Ounce and half; take 
a Quarter of a Pint each Morning fast-
ing, and also in the Afternoon, about 
three Hours after Dinner. 

Sometimes Take of Elixir Propriet at is tar-
tarised, five and twenty, or thirty Drops 
in a Glass of Mountain White-wine, 
twice a Day, viz. at about Eleven and 
Four.

Besides these Remedies, moderate Exercise, 
pure and well ventilated Air, Regularity and 
Temperance, in Eating and Drinking, must be 
carefully observed, without which the best 
Methods of Physick may be unavailing. 

As to those Medicines called by the Greek
Physicians Lithontriptica, that is, such as 
break and dissolve the Stone, either in the 
Kidneys or Bladder, and to which many Em-
piricks have pretended, assuring us that they 
gradually wear and crumble it away, and re-
|P_47
duce it to such minute Fragments, that they 
easily pass the Ureters into the Bladder, and 
with the same ease slide through, and are ex-
cluded thence together with the Urine: I ac-
knowledge I am incapable of conceiving how 
a Medicine ingested by the Mouth can produce 
this Effect. It is true, that the celebrated Car-
thaginian General Hannibal, as Historians re-
port, found means by Vinegar, or some in-
vented sharp and acid Liquor, to dissolve the 
Alpine Rocks, and so to eat his Way through 
those Mountains into Italy. But if any Pa-
tient, afflicted with the Stone, should swallow 
a proper Quantity of this powerful Fluid, were 
it to be had, or any other of like Vertue, since 
it must first undergo a great Alteration by the 
Ferment and digestive Faculty of the Stomach, 
and then a farther by mixing with the bilious 
Humours descending from the Gall-Bladder, 
and afterwards with the acid Juices issuing 
from the Pancreas, and then another by pas-
sing the lacteal Strainers, and mingling its 
Stores with the Lympha brought by numerous 
Water-Pipes into the common Receptacles; 
then another by its Admission into the Veins, 
where during repeated Circulations with great 
Celerity, the Parts by innumerable Attritions, 
Reverberations, and Glances from their violent 
##shing and beating one upon another, receive 
|P_48
great Comminution, and are attenuated, ex-
alted, and smoothed, till they acquire a re-
fined volatile State; and at last of all, since they 
must receive another Alteration by entering 
and passing the urinary Strainers in the Kid-
neys: Let, I say, all these Changes be contem-
plated, and will not, do you think, the Medi-
cine ingested be unedged and disarmed of its 
sharp Points and Angles, and lose all its dis-
solving or Stone-cutting Quality? For no acid 
Juices, not Vinegar itself, continue acid after 
they have mingled and circulated with the 
Blood, and have felt for some Time, the di-
gestive Power of its active Principles. 

Those bold Persons therefore that pretend 
to be Masters of Remedies, which given by the 
Mouth, will break or dissolve the Stone in the 
Kidneys, or the Bladder, impose upon Man-
kind, not only because the Medicine loses its 
peculiar Qualities, by undergoing such a Va-
riety of Changes and Alterations, as have been 
enumerated, but likewise by mingling and 
being diluted with above Twenty Pound of 
Blood, (for few Men have less) and frequent-
ly running its Circuit with it, by which means 
it becomes quite another Thing, before it 
reaches the Stone it was designed to dissolve 
or crumble to pieces. 

|P_49
It must be observed, that as above-menti-
oned, there are some porus, light, and friable 
Stones, whose Constructure is so slight, that 
they will by a little Shock or Collision, crum-
ble, and be divided into small Fragments, while 
the Parts of others so strictly cohere, that they 
are scarcely capable of Separation; and it is 
of these harder and more solid Stones that I 
speak, when I say they cannot be broken, or 
cut in pieces, by Remedies given at the Mouth, 
but they defy the Edge of the keenest Lithon-
triptick Weapon in all the Arsenals of Greece.

When therefore Stones or Gravel are at any 
Time removed from the Kidneys, and exclu-
ded with the Urine, it is not by Vertue of any 
Stone-breaking Medicine, acting upon them, 
but by the Operation of its diuretick Quality, 
exciting a great Separation of Serum, which 
rushing in a swift Current through the Kid-
neys, washes away in its Streams the Gravel 
and Stones lodged there, that by their propor-
tionate Magnitude are capable of passing the 
Ureters, as a sudden Storm or sharp Shower of 
Rain, rolls down the Streets in its Torrent, 
the Sand and loose Stones, as well as other 
promiscuous Impurities to be carried off by 
the common Drain: Though it is very pro-
bable that sometimes this Flood of Serum, 
|P_50
transmitted from the Veins by its immoderate 
Quantity, as well as the Strength of its Tide, 
in its Passage through the Kidneys, may like-
wise disunite, and shatter to Pieces some 
smaller friable Stones, whose Parts hang toge-
ther by a very slight Connexion. 

But if Nature or Art can afford any Medi-
cines, that are capable of breaking a hard 
large Stone in the Bladder, the most probable 
Way of making them effectual, would be to 
inject them directly into the Bladder; for then, 
having undergone none of those various Al-
terations above enumerated, which those Re-
medies must do that are taken by the Mouth, 
they would exert their Stone-dissolving Ver-
tue, if they have any, entire and undiminish-
ed, and would have the great Advantage of 
acting upon it by immediate Contact, by 
which means the Stone in the Bladder, if it 
could be effected by Medicines, would be 
wasted and moulder away. But Experience 
shews that this is not found practicable; for 
were such a Medicine discovered, it would 
prevent the Tortures and Misery of many un-
happy Patients, and make the useful Art of 
Cutting for the Stone unnecessary, of which 
I shall speak afterwards. 

|P_51
When large Stones are bred in the Kidneys, 
or such as cannot pass, but with great Pain and 
Difficulty, all forcing diuretick Medicines 
must, be forborn, and only such as are smooth, 
oily, and slippery should be employed; lest 
such as powerfully provoke Urine, should dis-
turb and push forward the bigger, that lay 
quiet in the Kidneys, into the Ureters, where 
they will either stop at the Entrance, or stick 
in the Passage, and by that Means either shut 
up the Mouth, or create a violent Fit of Pain, 
together with bloody Urine, if their Surface 
be rough and ragged; and therefore in such 
Cases, slimy, soft, and mucilaginous Remedies, 
are chiefly to be depended on, to promote the 
slipping of the Stone into the Bladder: And 
if active Diureticks, have been employed in 
vain to push on the Stone, which often hap-
pens in a violent Paroxysm, opiate Medicines 
of good Force should be given, that the Fibres 
of the enclosing Membranes, whilst stimu-
lated by the Torture of the Stone, and urged 
by the Medicine designed to expel it, being 
eased and lulled by their narcotick Vertue, 
may cease to contract themselves and clasp 
the Stone so closely, and by dilating and re-
laxing themselves while at Ease, may make 
Way for it to slide through into the Bladder. 
|P_52
But if the Stone in the Kidneys is large, solid, 
and branches through their Substance, no 
Means at all should be used for its Cure; for 
if there are any Remedies that have Power to 
break and dislodge its Fragments, which I be-
lieve, as I have said, there are not, what 
would that be, but to send them down to stop 
the Ureters, or to give unsufferable Torments, 
by sticking in their Channels! 

As to the Stone in the Bladder, which, as 
said above, is no more than a Stone first 
bred in the Kidney, and thence conveyed 
through the Ureters; where it receives its ob-
long Figure, into the Bladder, and gains there 
such a Magnitude, that it becomes incapable 
of being expelled with the Urine, being fed 
and augmented continually with new Gritt 
and sandy Materials washed from the Kidneys 
and falling down into the Bladder; when it 
first descends into that Receptacle, and its Size 
does not exceed a due Proportion, while it 
floats in the Urine, it often plays, aims, and 
offers at the Orifice of the Urethra, but its Fi-
gure or Position not being accommodated to 
it, cannot pass through that urinary Channel; 
and then it not only creates great Uneasiness, 
by lying cross its Mouth, but likewise often by 
interrupting the Streams of Urine, and some-
|P_53
times by totally obstructing the Passage. When 
the Gravel, or Stone, or Stones, are yet small 
enough to enter and pass the Urethra, to faci-
litate their Discharge, the Veins should be 
filled with such diuretick Liquors, as I have 
before set down, that they may communicate 
a constant Flow of Urine to the Bladder, 
which being commonly kept full, will be the 
more apt to eject the Stone, together with the 
Flood that distends it. But if it grows so 
great, that it becomes unable to make its Way, 
by Reason of its disproportionate Size, it will 
be daily augmented by the Accretion or Ad-
dition of new Gritt or Gravel, carried from 
the Kidneys, through the Ureters, by the 
Streams of Urine, as Sand and small Stones, 
are rolled along from a rising Ground, by Rills 
of Water, that flow down its Sides. Now these 
Sands or minute Concretions, as I have ex-
plained above, are the Seeds, or Mother of the 
Stone, that is, the Principles or first Materials, 
that combine for the Formation of it in the 
Kidneys, and afterwards to its Augmentation 
in the Bladder; and to hinder its encreasing 
there to a great Magnitude, those Remedies 
are to be used which were enumerated before, 
for cutting off the Generation of Gravel, and 
such sandy and fabulous Combinations; to 
which I refer the Reader. 

|P_54
But if through Neglect, or the Inability of 
Methods and Medicines to prevent the breed-
ing of Sand and Gravel in the Kidneys, which 
washed away by the Urine into the Bladder, 
constantly feed and amplify the Stones con-
fined there, which grow not like Animals and 
Vegetables, by Nourishment admitted by the 
Mouth or the Root, and conveyed and distri-
buted to the outward Parts from the inward, 
but by the daily Access, Accumulation, and 
Adhesion, of hard, sandy Particles to the Sur-
face of the Stone; if, I say, the Stone, by the 
Arrival and Complication of new petrifying 
Principles, becomes large and ponderous, and 
being attended with a terrible Train of Symp-
toms, that render the Patient a great Object of 
Compassion, while Death is more eligible 
than Life, and no effectual Means can be sug-
gested, how it may be cut, dissolved, or crum-
bled to pieces, as I have before demonstrated, 
all that can be done by Medicine, is to quiet 
or reduce the enormous Pains and Torments, 
inflicted by this cruel Disease; and for the ef-
fecting of this, only crude Opium, or its Pre-
parations, the Gift of Divine Benignity to mi-
tigate the Tortures, and alleviate the extream 
Miseries of Mankind, can be depended on. 
This is the Patient's Refuge, and the only Con-
|P_55
solation to allay his Agonies, and restrain the 
Rage of his Sufferings. And therefore in this 
Case, let him take the following Pills. 

Take of Saffron, beat small, three Grains; 
of Extract of Gentian, six Grains; of 
crude Opium dissolved and strained, a 
Grain and half; Balsamick Syrup, 
enough to make it into Pills, for one 
Dose, to be taken in violent Pains, and 
repeated when the Force of the first is 
worn off, if the Torments continue. 

But if the Quantity of Opium prescribed, is 
not sufficient to remove the Pain, it may gra-
dually be encreased, by adding a Quarter of a 
Grain; and if that likewise should be ineffec-
tual, add half a Grain, and so on, till the Pa-
tient has found what is the just Quantity that 
will relieve him, and when he has taken his 
Measure, and settled the Proportion, he will 
be obliged to take it as often as his Agonies 
shall make it absolutely necessary. All 
smooth, soft, and slippery Meats and Drinks, 
as well as Medicines must be chosen; for 
those of an opposite Nature will irritate and 
enrage the Paroxysm, especially if an Ulcer 
|P_56
attends the Stone, which is an incurable Dis-
ease: And as Ulcers produced either in the 
Kidneys, or the Neck of the Bladder, from 
other Causes besides the Stone, elude the 
Force of all Remedies, which is likewise the 
Case of all other internal Ulcers in the Lungs, 
Liver, &c. so those, that arise from the Fret-
ting and Laceration of the Membranes in the 
Kidneys or the Bladder, by Stones of a rough 
and ragged Superficies, can never be healed, 
at least while the Stone continuing there, is 
always wearing and wounding the Part where 
it lodges: And therefore all that can be done, 
is to drink plentifully of smooth, and soft Li-
quors, besides taking slippery and oily Reme-
dies, that may constantly dilute and wash a-
way the ulcerous Matter, lest gathering to-
gether in too great a Quantity, it should stop 
the Passage of the Urine; which Obstruction 
is sometimes so great, that the Surgeon's Hand 
is necessarily required to pass his Catheter in-
to the Bladder, for the Relief of the Patient, 
through which the imprisoned Urine may 
flow freely out; and the Patient is obliged to 
fly to this Refuge for Ease, as often as Clysters 
and other Medicines ingested by the Mouth 
are ineffectual. The soft and smooth Liquors 
that may assist the Patient, by diluting the 
|P_57
corrupt Matter, and making it fit to flow, are 
Mead, or other Liquors made of Honey; also 
Decoctions of Barley, Liquorish, Marsh-mal-
lows, dryed Figgs, and Raisins of the Sun, 
stoned; or rather, the following Apozem. 

Take of Flowers of Mallows, an handful; 
of Root of Marsh-mallows, half an Ounce; 
of sweet Fennel-Root, an Ounce; of 
Leaves of Violet, Parietaria, each a 
Pugil; of Anise and Carraway Seeds, 
each a Drachm and half; boil all in 
three Pints of Spring-Water, to a Quart, 
strain it, and add of Syrup of Marsh-
mallows, three Ounces; and six Drachms 
of the Tincture of Saffron, made with 
Treacle-Water; drink half a Pint, or six 
Ounces of it, three Times a Day. 

The smoothest and softest Spring-Water, 
should be chosen for common Drink, such as 
that of Bristol, or any other, that rises from 
Chalk-Hills: A good Draught likewise of 
White-wine, and new Ale, [mind this] now 
and then repeated, is useful to dislodge and 
carry off the noxious and impure Matter, issu-
ing from an Ulcer in the Kidneys or Bladder; 
and the Sediment of each of them is distin-
|P_58
guished by their slimy, glutinous and ropy 
Quality, from the white, mealy and light Con-
tents, found often in the Urine, from scor-
butick Causes, as above suggested, that by 
shaking the Glass, will presently rise and float 
in the Bosom of it, which however has no 
weight, nor viscous, nor gritty Quality, but 
swims in pale, discontinued, and incoherent 
Matter, communicated to the Urine from the 
Blood, abounding with such Impurities. And 
they are discriminated from one another, by 
a fætid and offensive Smell, proper to the Mat-
ter discharged from an Ulcer in the Bladder, 
and contracted from long mixing with the 
Urine, which is not found in those slimy Con-
tents that flow down from the Kidneys, and 
are excluded with the serous Streams, as I have 
above explained. 

After all, when notwithstanding the due 
Care and Observance of the best Rules to pre-
vent it, the Stone in the Bladder grows very 
large, and the Pains are greater than Humane 
Patience can bear, the last Refuge from this 
dreadful Tormentor, is manual Operation, 
when Incision is made into the Bladder, and 
the Stone extracted through the Wound. So 
strong is the Principle of Self-Preservation, 
and so terrible the Idea and Apprehension of 
|P_59
Death, that to continue a little longer in Be-
ing, Men submit, not only to a great Variety 
of lingering Sufferings and Calamities, but 
likewise to the acutest Fains, or which their 
yeilding to this Method of curing the Stone, 
is a most convincing Evidence. 

Though the Cutting for the Stone is a pain-
ful Operation, and attended with the Hazard 
of Life, yet many Patients have been relieved 
by it, and continued well after it for many 
Years, especially those, that were Cut in their 
Youth. Yet it must be acknowledged, that 
many also have miscarried, either from the 
Nature of the Stone, their ill Habit of Body, 
the Unskilfulness of the Operator, or his want 
or sufficient knowledge in Surgery to heal the 
Wound. And this Misfortune often happens 
likewise from the Patient's deferring the Ope-
ration too long, out of an Abhorrence of the 
Violence of the Cure, or from flattering Hopes 
that the Disease will not arise to that Extre-
mity, and torment them with such insuffer-
able Symptoms. It is therefore the Interest 
of Persons afflicted with it, to undergo the 
Operation, by which the Stone is extracted, 
when as yet it is of a moderate Size, and there-
fore more Easily to be drawn through the 
Wound, and before their Strength is ex-
|P_60
hausted by long Sufferings, and repeated Pa-
roxysms of Torture, and before the Ulcer 
that is often formed by it, becomes deep and 
inveterate; and then, while their Vigour is 
unwasted, and their Constitution otherwise 
hail, and the Stone not of an extraordinary 
Magnitude, the Operation is likely to be suc-
cessful: And if these Rules were observed, the 
Lives of many of these unhappy Patients 
might be saved, that are lost for want of a 
timely Submission to this Method of Cure. 

When the Stone, lapsed from the Kidneys 
into the Bladder, are not augmented there to 
that Proportion, as makes them incapable of 
entering into the Mouth of the Urethra, yet 
sometimes after it has entered, it is however 
too large to make its Way through that Aquæ-
duct, and therefore stops in the Road, where 
it not only creates great Pain, but likewise 
obstructs the Current of the Water, till at 
length there is no Remedy left but the Sur-
geon's Art, who in this Case easily relieves 
the Sufferer, by cutting upon the Stone where 
he feels it lodged, and thrusting it forth 
through the Orifice of the Wound: And this 
is the most practicable and least dangerous 
Instance of Cutting for the Stone. 

|P_61
As for Cutting into the Bladder, and ex-
tracting the Stone thence, various Methods 
have been invented, of which a distinct and 
accurate History is not the Business of this 
Dissertation: It is enough for me in this Place 
to mention the most Practicable and safest 
Way, and this, as I am informed, is that of 
cutting into the Bladder, in the Region above 
the Os Pubis, lately brought into Use. Whe-
ther there occur any dark and obscure Hints 
of this Practice in ancient or modern Authors, 
or whether the first Invention does Honour 
to the ingenious Surgeon Mr. Douglass, it is 
certain, that either as Reviver or Inventor of 
this new Method, he has deseryed well of 
Mankind, and merited the Thanks and Es-
teem of all the Faculty, since all Ways of per-
forming this Operation known before, were 
accompanied with more difficulty, more suf-
fering, and greater Hazard of Life. 

Before the Patient consents to undergo this 
Method of Cure, great Care and Caution 
should be used, that the Operator may be sure 
himself, and so able to satisfy the Patient, 
that there is a Stone in the Bladder, the Cause 
of all his painful Symptoms, and fit to be ex-
tracted. For there have been other Diseases 
of the Bladder, that have so perfectly imitated 
|P_62
the Stone in all its Symptoms, and have im-
posed upon Surgeons, eminent in their Art, 
who after strict Search have pronounced the 
Case to be the Stone, yet when they have cut 
the Patient to relieve him, no Stone has been 
found, and upon opening the dead Body, ei-
ther a Fungus, or some Excrescency, grown 
to a great Bigness in the Neck of the Bladder, 
or some other Disease, or Errour of Nature 
in the Bladder, appeared to be the only 
Cause of all the Nephretick-like Symptoms, 
that afflicted the Patient: And therefore, I 
say, the Undertaker, before he attempts the 
Operation, ought with the greatest Delibera-
tion, and most careful Scrutiny, to get the 
fullest Conviction in himself, of the real 
Existence of the Stone in the Place he expects to 
find it. 

FINIS.
