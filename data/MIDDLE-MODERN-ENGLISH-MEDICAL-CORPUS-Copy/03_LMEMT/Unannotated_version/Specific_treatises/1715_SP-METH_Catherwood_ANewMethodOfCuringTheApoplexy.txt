[}A 
NEW METHOD
Of Curing 
APOPLEXIES, 
AND 
Other Distempers of the HEAD. }]
[^Decorative frame around the letter "N".^]NOtwithstanding the va-
rious Treatises that have 
been writ by learned and 
ingenious Men, as well 
antient as modern, on 
this Subject, which have been han-
dled with the greatest Accurateness 
as to the Theory; yet for the Me-
|P_2
thodof treating it thro the whole 
Course, particularly at its first Ap-
pearance, I find nothing writ more 
forreign from the Purpose: For by 
bleeding out of the Veins, and other 
usual Methods of Practice, they prey 
upon and exhaust the animal Spirits, 
and confirm the Distemper, rather 
than relieve the Patient. 

But not to detain the Reader with 
the Measures others have taken, and 
still persist in; I shall only offer my 
own Thoughts, and the Method by 
which for some Years past I've found 
such happy Success, as well in Flan-
ders, as elsewhere, confirm'd by a 
few Observations. Therefore without 
any further Introduction, I shall just 
describe this Disease, and proceed. 

'Tis then an Apoplexy when the 
Body is suddenly depriv'd of the 
chief Animal Faculties, as well in-
ternal as external, and all voluntary 
Motion, so that the Animal Spirits 
are either deny'd a Passage from the 
Brain, or an Entrance into it; the 
Ventricles or Pores of the Brain be-
ing either compress'd from a Contu-
|P_3
sion, or obstructed from a Plethora, 
Poisons, Medicines endued with a 
Narcotic Faculty, which so alter 
the Blood, Lymph, and other Fluids, 
as to render 'em unfit to pass freely 
thro the Arteries of the Brain, 
whereby, thro the violent Impetus of 
of the Heart, the Blood is so wedg'd 
in, that it causes a Stagnation; and 
oftentimes Polypuses are form'd in 
the Carotids, Sinus's, and Vertebral 
Arteries, so that all the Spirits in-
dulgent Nature can rally to support 
the Fabric, are detach'd to the Mus-
cles of the Thorax, to perform Re-
spiration, without which the Patient 
is inevitably lost. 

Now since the Brain is the Seat of 
this Disease, 'twill not be at all im-
proper to take notice of its Struc-
ture, as well as its Use, before I pro-
ceed any farther. There are then 
two Substances which constitute 
the Brain, viz. the Cinericious, being 
the Exterior, call'd the Cortical; the 
inner, from its Whiteness and Soft-
ness, the Medullary: the former of 
which, according to Malpigius, is 
nothing but a Gland of the conglo-
|P_4
merate kind, or a Heap of small o-
val Glands contiguous with each o-
ther; to each of which is affix'd an 
Artery that brings the Blood, by 
the means of which Glands the Mat-
ter constituting the Animal Spirits, 
is secern'd from its purer and sub-
tler Parts: from hence the Veins 
carry back the refluent Blood, that's 
unfit for generating of Spirits; and 
then the Nerve, or Root of a Nerve, 
in which, as in an excretory Duct of 
a Gland, the Spirits just now perfec-
ted, are carry'd into the Medulla-
ry Substance, as a Storehouse or 
Magazine, and from thence thro 
the whole nervous System, for the 
Benefit of conveying Sense and Mo-
tion to the Animal Oeconomy. 

Now since not only the Corti-
cal Substance of the Brain, but 
the Medullary also, and even the 
Nerves themselves are interspers'd 
with an infinite Number of exces-
sive small Blood-Vessels; whatever 
causes an Obstruction in them, or 
makes 'em too turgid, causes an Apo-
plexy in some degree or other, by 
pressing on the Nerves, and so pre-
|P_5
venting the Circulation of their 
Fluid. 

To diminish then the Quantity of 
Blood from the Veins, is what all have 
had immediate recourse to as their 
chief Refuge and Asylum, either from 
the Frontal, Jugular, Cephalic, or Me-
diana for a Revulsion; whereas that 
is now exploded, the Laws of Cir-
culation not admitting it: and if 
this did not answer their Expecta-
tion, the Patient was given over as 
in a desperate Case; according to this 
of Hippocrates, speaking of an Apo-
plexy, Venae sectio, ni juvet, occi-
det; or this of Celsus, to the same 
purpose, Sanguinis detractio, vel oc-
cidit, vel liberat. Which is enough 
to convince us how prejudicial such 
Evacuations from the Veins were 
found, and how uncertain the Prac-
tice was observ'd to be, even by the 
Antients; tho, for want of a better, 
it has unhappily been persisted in to 
this present time. 

'Twas indeed in many Cases fre-
quently us'd by the Antients, but 
now become so much in vogue, that 
'tis order'd almost on all Occasions, 
|P_6
except in Cachectic Persons, or those 
grown Hydropical by impoverish'd 
Blood, Diseases contracted by Hun-
ger, Fatigue, &c.

Let the Obstruction be where it 
will, tho at the Fingers end, open-
ing a Vein must relieve it. I can't 
indeed wonder that the Antients did 
it, being in a manner Strangers to A-
natomy, and knowing nothing of the 
Circulation of the Blood: but since, 
by the indefatigable Industry of the 
Moderns, that Part of Learning is 
arriv'd to such Perfection, I admire 
there's not more notice taken of the 
Inconveniencies that attend Phlebo-
tomy; but 'tis past over as an Ope-
ration to be attempted by any Per-
son, at any Season, regard being on-
ly had to the Strength of the Pa-
tient, touching of the Nerve, Ten-
don, or its Aponeurosis. 

But if by an Obstruction, Apo-
plexies, or any Distemper incident to 
the Head is caus'd; to make a more 
copious Evacuation, and speedy De-
rivation, the Discharge must be made 
by opening the Jugulars: which O-
peration falls so far short of their 
|P_7
Intention, that it proves far more 
dismal in its Consequences; by so 
much the more effectually confirm-
ing the Obstruction, by how much 
the nearer the Ligatures approach 
the Part affected. 

Experienc'd Surgeons indeed will 
use no Ligature round the Neck, for 
fear of Suffocation in Apoplexies 
and Squinanceys but only let a 
Stander-by compress the Jugular, 
on the contrary side, with his 
Thumb, and fix their own just be-
low the Place where they design 
their Aperture. But too many use 
Ligatures, and either apply the middle 
of the Fillet behind the Neck, the 
two Ends being brought before and 
twisted; or turn one End over one 
Clavicle, and under the contrary Ax-
illa, and so the two Ends are brought 
before and fastned: both which are 
very pernicious, particularly the lat-
ter, which by pressing on the Ax-
illary Vein, stops the refluent Blood; 
by which, besides confirming the 
Obstruction, as before mention'd, 
Syncopes, Palpitations, Tremors, 
and the like are caused: for what-
|P_8
ever thwarts or crosses the circular 
Progress of the Blood, produces 
these Effects. 

But even bleeding in the Arm, the 
Tediousness of the Operation is such, 
and the Advantage that can be ex-
pected from it so small, I can by no 
means be reconcil'd to. For first the 
Ligature must be strain'd, in order 
to cause the Veins to swell, for the 
more commodious introducing the 
Lancet; which perhaps after all re-
quires the Surgeon's Frictions, to 
force the Blood to the intended In-
cision: and this is not sufficient, but 
often there must be hot Cloaths, and 
the Arm plung'd in hot Water; and 
then when the Aperture is made, by 
the Misapplication of the Bandage, 
the Skin relaxes, the Orifice closes, 
and obstructs its Passage: and when 
the Impetuosity of the Blood abates, 
the Ligature is again slacken'd, that 
as much Blood may pass into that 
Part by the Arteries, as will suffice 
for the intended Evacuation. During 
which time, the Obstruction is con-
firming; for the Blood in the Veins 
steers an easy Course from nar-
|P_9
rower Passages to broader Channels, 
thro their soft Tunicles, quite diffe-
rent from those of the Arteries; 
whose Coats being elastic, parti-
cularly in the large Trunks, give a 
Velocity to the Blood, which if in-
tercepted, causes the Blood to be so 
turgid in the capillary Vessels of 
the Brain, even to extravasate, and 
obstructs the Spirits in the Sensorium 
Commune, the first Course of all 
Nervous Distempers; as Palsies, 
Cramps, Convulsions, Apoplexies, 
Emaciations, and insensible Decays, 
without any visible Cause, that it 
would even pose Persons of the best 
Judgment to account for it; as also 
that Chronical Distemper, the Hy-
drocephalus, or watry Humour in the 
Head, which proceeds from extrava-
sated Lymph, occasion'd by the 
Compression of the Lymphatics. 

What has been said will be suffi-
cient to convince any unprejudiced 
Person, of the Inconveniences that 
attend Phlebotomy. If we reflect 
on the first Rise of this Operation, 
'twill not much heighten our Esteem 
of it. Pliny, in his Natural History, 
|P_10
tells a whimsical Story of the Hyp-
popotamus, or Sea-Horse; who, when 
he finds himself heavy or indispos'd, s
eeks out the sharpest pointed Thorn, 
with which he pricks a certain Vein 
of the Leg; and after a Quantity 
of Blood is drawn, stops the Wound 
with Mud: a very poor Precedent, 
that we are oblig'd to have recourse 
to for this Operation. 

But all the proposed Ends will 
be answer'd by opening an Artery.
Tho I'm well assur'd this Hypothesis 
will be exploded by the greatest part 
of the Faculty, it being not only what 
is uncommon, but also their being un-
acquainted how the Operation is to 
be perform'd, and the hazard of at-
tempting it, will occasion the fol-
lowing Objections, to render this 
Method trifling and inconsiderable. 

Some fancy with Celsus, that an 
Artery once cut, by reason of its 
Systole and Diastole, from the Solu-
tion of its Fibres, can't again consoli-
date and grow together, but forms a 
Thrombus. 

|P_11
Others have had Stupidity enough 
to affirm, that those Vessels must 
be past through with a Needle and 
Thread, in order to re-unite them. 

Again, there are those who will 
allow of it in some Cases; yet own 
that they contract, retire within the 
Flesh, are cicatrized there, and so 
cease from their Office of conveying 
Blood to that Part. 

There are also some, that after 
they have been prevail'd upon to 
acknowledge the Possibility of their 
Re-union; yet still object against 
the Inconveniencies of Bandages, 
which must necessarily be continued 
for several Days. 

But when these Objections have 
been answer'd by ocular Demonstra-
tion, they'l undertake to prove, that 
the Blood in the Arteries, and that 
of the Veins, does not in the least 
differ in their component Parts; and 
that both being continued Tubes, it 
matters not out of which the Eva-
cuation is made. Whereas there is 
no greater difference between the 
Fluid contain'd in the Lympheducts 
and Nerves, than between that in 
|P_12
the Veins and Arteries: that of the 
Arteries being of a more lively, flo-
rid, scarlet Colour, more subtil and 
spiritous, and the Vehicle that con-
veys the Alimentary or Nutritious 
Particles, which in their progressive 
Motion, press upon those Glands 
whose Pores are adapted to admit of 
such Juices as serve either for Ac-
cretion, Nutrition, or Reparation: 
whereas the Venal being only the 
Refuse of those Secretions, returns 
to the Heart, that so by filling its 
Coronary Vessels and Ventricles it 
may be enabled to perform its Mo-
tion of Contraction and Dilatation, 
which, if its Reflux be intercepted 
by Bandages, it must necessarily be 
depriv'd of, and consequently such 
Effects are produc'd as before men-
tion'd. So that this Objection is as 
trifling and frivolous as the rest. 

These being so easily answer'd, a-
nother unanswerable Objection is 
started, viz. That that Branch, which 
we durst attempt to draw Blood 
from, is so small, as not to admit of 
a plentiful Discharge. 

|P_13
But the most powerful Argument 
to answer all these Objections, is De-
monstration. I've us'd this Method 
in all Cases where diminishing the 
Quantity of Blood is requir'd, whe-
ther in Apoplexies, Quinancies, In-
flammations of the Lungs, Pleuri-
sies, Asthma's; in all sorts of Fe-
vers, whether intermitting, continual, 
or malignant, without the least mis-
chievous Accident attending it. But 
this Precaution must be used, that it be 
such an Artery as immediately passes 
over a Bone, which are none but those 
of the Head; and of these the Tem-
poral Artery is the Principal, it being 
the most considerable Branch of the 
Carotid, which passing over the Os 
Temporale, admits of a double Com-
press. This may be open'd with less 
Danger, and with far greater Success 
than any Vein; and I've frequently 
seen it run with as continu'd a Stream, 
as from the Arm. 

By this time there's no room to 
doubt but the chief Difficulties are 
remov'd; and because so few are ac-
custom'd to this Operation, I shall 
just mention how 'tis perform'd; 
|P_14
which is thus. Press your Finger on 
the Vessel, above the place where 
you design your Aperture, and your 
Thumb on the said Vessel beneath, 
to keep the Skin smooth, and the 
Vessel from rolling; then introduce 
your Lancet, raising up its Point to 
cut thro the Vessels and Teguments, 
but not by Punction, as too many 
do in opening the Veins; by which 
means you may make as plentiful a 
Discharge as you please, without be-
ing liable to the afore-mention'd In-
conveniencies that attend Phlebo-
tomy. 

After which, you have nothing else 
to do than to place your Thumb on 
the Orifice, and press it against the 
Os Temporale; so that if a Throm-
bus should arise, 'tis soon dispers'd, 
and in a few Minutes the Lips of the 
Orifice will unite. This done, you 
may either use a Pledgit of Lint with 
a Plaister, or if you please, the Com-
press with the circular Bandage, 
which is sufficient without the least 
Occasion of Styptics. 

|P_15
This Aperture gives an immediate 
Check to the impetuous Velocity of 
the ascending Blood; which by the 
Systole or Contraction of the Heart 
is projected to the Head by the Ca-
rotids and Vertebral Arteries, and 
by means of their Semilunary Valves 
prevent its Return to the Heart by 
the same Vessels; so that in an in-
stant it relieves the Patient, without 
preventing the Blood, Lymph, and 
Nervous Fluid, from performing their 
circular Tour, which by Ligatures 
must necessarily be intercepted. 

Suppose several Springs send out as 
many Rivulets, which after various 
Turnings and Windings unite and 
form a River, which is receiv'd in a Ba-
son; wherein an Engin is fix'd, which, 
with its repeated projectile Force, 
throws the Water into several Tubes, 
in order to be convey'd to and sup-
ply all Parts of a City: now should 
there be an Obstruction in the Pipes, 
the Engineer may as well expect to 
remove it by diverting and dimi-
nishing the Water in the Rivulets, by 
a different Current, as a Physician 
may expect to remove an Obstruction 
|P_16
in the Arteries, by ordering bleeding 
out of the Veins. 

But there is no occasion to intro-
duce Similies to prove what is so ve-
ry obvious. 

'Tis the part of a Physician to 
assist Nature, by observing nicely 
the various Steps she takes to re-
pulse the Enemy. Natura curat Mor-
bos, says Celsus. The Dogmatist, that 
can reason learnedly on a Disease, 
but has not throughly consider'd the 
Nature of it, and the Method of 
Cure, falls far short of a meer Em-
pyric, who practises only by Ex-
perience without any Foundation of 
Learning; so that 'tis not the being 
a learned Philosopher, an accurate A-
natomist, that entitles a Man to be 
a great Physician. That successful 
Practitioner, Dr. Radcliff, never pre-
tended to any of these Qualifica-
tions, nay took a Pleasure to disown 
his Knowledg in them; but who in 
his time so happy to strike at the 
Root of a Distemper! 

The Father of Physic, Hippocra-
tes, when the Art was in its Infan-
cy, especially that part of it, Ana-
|P_17
tomy, how ignorant was he of some 
Parts of Learning, that the Moderns 
glory in, and value themselves upon? 
as appears from the confus'd Ac-
count he gives, that the Veins take 
their Rise from the Liver: and speak-
ing of an Artery, he means the 
Aspera Arteria; and then calls the 
Ureters Veins, and makes a Jumble 
of Nerves, Veins, and Arteries. But 
then who so great and successful a 
Practitioner ever before or since? 

Tho I'm not unsensible that seve-
ral Authors have touch'd on this 
Subject, yet what first induc'd me to 
the Opinion of Arteriotomy, was, 
that I don't remember ever to have 
read or heard of Women liable to 
Apoplexies, unless from Poisons, O-
piates, or Mismanagement of some 
foregoing Distemper. For however 
Authors differ in their several Hy-
potheses laid down to account for 
the Periodical Purgations of Wo-
men, whether this menstruous Blood 
offends in Quantity or Quality, 
it matters not to my present Pur-
pose; but whenever this Efferves-
cence is raised, whether Natural, 
|P_18
Periodical, or provok'd by Emena-
gogues, it occasions an Aperture of 
the Mouths of the Vaginal Arte-
ries, and not of the Veins. 

The Haemorroides, or Piles, by 
some vitious Ferment irritating the 
tender Fibres of the Arteries, by 
them is discharged incredible Quan-
tities of Blood. Borellus relates a 
Story of a certain Tailor, who lost 
Ten Pounds by those Vessels, and 
yet recover'd. 

How many Instances have we had 
of profuse Haemorrhagies of the 
Nose? Bartholin mentions one who 
bled forty eight Pound in three Days, 
without the Loss of Life. 'Tis well 
known that bleeding at the Nose re-
moves Obstructions and Pains of 
the Head, whether proceeding from 
an Ebullition or Redundancy of 
Blood. And whence is this Discharge 
but by an Anastomosis, or Sponta-
neous disjoining of the Capillary 
Arteries, occasion'd by a convulsive 
Contraction of the Coats of a larger 
Artery? which must necessarily give 
an extraordinary Distention to the 
next, till the Blood can be no longer 
|P_19
contain'd, but bursts out with Im-
petuosity, even to Pounds; whereas 
a few Ounces, discharg'd by the 
Veins, has thrown the Patient into 
Faintings, Swoonings, and occasion'd 
even Death it self. 

Now since indulgent Nature is so 
clear in her Dictates, points out an 
exact Method how we may free her 
from the Insults of the common E-
nemy, Diseases; 'tis unreasonable 
we should not fall in with her Mea-
sures. 

By this time I hope any unpreju-
dic'd Reader will be reconcil'd to 
Arteriotomy, and not be byas'd by 
Custom to prefer that of Phlebo-
tomy.

Phlebotomy preceding, the next 
Intention is exhibiting Emetics;
which from Observation I shall prove 
to be so far from relieving the Pa-
tient, that it proves very pernicious. 

For before the Vomit is adminis-
tred, 'tis easy to suppose to what a de-
gree the Glands of the Brain are fil-
trated, and perhaps the Sanguiferous 
Vessels and Lymphatics burst. This 
|P_20
extravasated Blood and Lymph dis-
charg'd into the Sinus's of the Brain, 
and there coagulated and lodg'd: 
what Relief can possibly be expec-
ted from an Emetick, which is dia-
metrically opposite to their former 
Intention of bleeding out of the 
Jugulars? For in this there is some 
colour of Reason to expect the Re-
moval of the Obstruction; from that 
there's no room to hope for any 
thing but a Confirmation of the Dis-
temper; nor truly in any other Dis-
ease, unless when the principal Seat 
is in the Stomach and Intestines, to 
discharge the morbific Matter, col-
lected in the Primae Viae. Then an 
Emetic is not altogether unseason-
able; tho even then other Measures 
may be taken less hazardous, and e-
qually advantageous. But in this 
Case: Vomits are as contrary to true 
Practice, as this Operation to Na-
ture; the Fibres of the Stomach 
being so dispos'd, as to discharge its 
Contents through the Intestines: but 
by these irritating Vomits the Dia-
phragm, Intercostals, and Muscles 
of the lower Belly are so stimulated, 
|P_21
that by means of their violent Con-
traction, they force 'em thro the Oe-
sophagus: for what with the violent 
convulsive Motion of the abovesaid 
Muscles, together with the Quick-
ness of the Organs of Respiration, 
the Blood is precipitately hurried and 
projected to the Brain with that 
Force as to increase the Extravasa-
tion. How then it is possible rea-
sonably to expect Relief from it, I 
can't conjecture. An antient Phy-
sician, speaking of an Apoplexy and 
its Cure, lays down this as a Rule: 
Vomitoria fugienda, ne suffocationis pe-
riculum augeatur, et caput repleatur.
Nay, in his Purgatives he would not 
allow the least Quantity of Antimo-
ny, it being also endued with a vo-
miting Faculty: Antimonium non 
convenit, cum vomitum simul moveat;
such sort of irritating Medicines be-
ing sufficient of themselves to pro-
duce Apoplexies. 

And I, for my part, verily believe, 
that were the Bills of Mortality nice-
ly examin'd into, and the Causes of 
those Casualties strictly enquir'd af-
ter; they would be found more owing 
|P_22
to the irregular Administration of 
improper Medicines, than to any 
peccant Matter in the Fluids, or any 
external Cause whatever. 

What I have said I shall only con-
firm with two or three Observations, 
and that as concisely as possible. 

[}Obs. 1. }]
There was one Mr. Roach of Bris-
tol, who for a long time had labour'd 
under an Asthma, attended with a 
violent Cough till almost suffocated; 
but after he had expectorated this 
viscid Phlegm, was reliev'd: but the 
Disease increasing, and despairing of 
Relief, he apply'd himself to me, in-
form'd me he had been so afflicted 
for many Years, that at Spring and 
Fall he had very severe Fits of the 
Gout; so that what with one and 
t'other, he was render'd incapable of 
prosecuting any Business. I exhibi-
ted Medicines of a warm attenuating 
kind, to disentangle and carry off 
the vitious Matter, promote Expec-
toration, fortify the Stomach and 
Lungs, which effectually compleated 
the Cure. After which he could en-
|P_23
dure the Fatigue either of walking or 
riding, was able to dispatch his Affairs 
with his usual Alacrity and Plea-
sure. But since my Removal from 
Bristol, his old Indisposition returning 
afresh, he had immediate Recourse to 
his former Chip-in-Pottage Doctor, 
that safe Physician that never did 
him any good nor hurt, till he pre-
scribed that innocent harmless Vomit, 
that extoll'd Indian Root, Ipecacoan-
na; which he had no sooner taken 
with a Draught of Carduus Tea, but 
presently he complain'd of a Dizzi-
ness, and that every thing appear'd to 
him to have a circular Motion: which 
he had no sooner said, but he dropt 
down dead. 

Some may imagine that this Acci-
dent was not owing entirely to the 
Emetic, but a Plethora; and had 
bleeding preceded, in order to have 
emptied the Vessels, the Patient 
might have been saved: which Ob-
jection, tho I could answer with 
several Instances, I shall only men-
tion one. 

|P_24
[}Obs. 2. }]
Mr. Snow, a Broker of about 
Seventy Years of Age, being on 
the Exchange, was taken with a 
violent Fit of an Apoplexy, and fell 
down as dead; but by means of Cor-
dials, after some time began a little 
to recover; by which time a Sur-
geon came, and took away about 
Sixteen Ounces of Blood from the 
Arm. I (being accidentally intro-
duc'd by a Friend, who desir'd my 
Advice) prevented his taking away 
a greater Quantity, but order'd that 
he might be carry'd home in a Chair; 
which Motion contributed mightily 
to a free and uninterrupted Circula-
tion, insomuch that he began to have 
a regular Pulse. I advised that this 
Motion might be continued, finding 
a natural Warmth all over his Body, 
which with administring comfortable 
Draughts, would be sufficient to an-
swer our end. But a certain Apo-
thecary coming, whose Advice was 
more prevalent with the Patient's 
Friends, administred a Vomit under 
the pretence of a Cordial: this not 
|P_25
immediately operating, in less than 
half a quarter of an hour was about 
to repeat it; which he confidently 
affirm'd would answer his End, and 
to confirm his Assertion, assur'd his 
Friends he was that moment come 
from a Gentleman taken after the 
same manner, and reliev'd by the 
same Method; but they had only his 
own Word for it, to which I could 
give but very little Credit. This 
poor unhappy Gentleman however 
was lost by this Treatment. 

I could enumerate Instances of 
this kind from my own Observa-
tion, of the ill Effects of Vomits; 
whether Bleeding had preceded, or 
been omitted. I shall give one, to 
shew that 'tis safer to rely on 
Nature it self, to observe its various 
Steps, and endeavour to assist her on-
ly with refreshing Cardiac Draughts; 
than to have recourse to Physicians 
unacquainted with the Nature of this 
Disease, as too many are; tho from 
Persons of such penetrating Judg-
ment, ready Wit, and bright Parts, 
greater things might be expected. 

|P_26
[}Obs. 3. }]
William Whittington Esq; of Sta-
pleton near Bristol, now High Sheriff 
of the County of Gloucester, near 
eighty Years of Age, returning home 
alone from the City on a gentle Pad, 
was seiz'd with an Apoplectic Fit, 
fell back on his Horse, his Legs stiff 
and extended, and to all Appear-
ance dead; but being overtaken by 
some returning from a neighbouring 
Market, who took care to convey him 
to an adjacent Alehouse, where they 
pour'd Brandy down his Throat, as 
also a Glass or two of Canary: by 
which Method, together with re-
peated Frictions all over his Body, 
he came to himself, was sent home 
in his own Chariot, where he no 
sooner came, but jocosely calld for 
his Staff of Life, and Support of old 
Age, meaning a Bit of Bread and a 
Glass of Canary. The next Day he 
took a gentle Cordial purging Draught, 
and without the use of any other 
Medicines recover'd; only never mist 
the returning Fit twice a year, which 
encreas'd in its Violence Spring and

Fall, till a violent Fever follow'd 
the last, which he not expecting to 
conquer, sent for me: and having 
before observ'd what seem'd to be 
most advantageous, and by what 
Method Nature was most reliev'd, 
without cramming him with Medi-
cines, I advis'd him to nothing but 
to drink old Canary as a Ptisan, by 
which alone he was perfectly reco-
ver'd; and ever since has been freed 
from those kind of Fits. 

Not only Phlebotomy, unseasonable 
Use of Emetics, but Cathartics also, 
if not well adapted to the Disease, 
may prove very prejudicial to the 
Patient. Other Diseases mismanaged 
may and often do terminate in an 
Apoplexy. 

[}Obs. 4. }]
An Inhabitant of Bristol, that kept 
a Public House on the Castle-Green,
labouring under a Dropsy in the Ab-
domen, accompany'd with an Asthma
and Jaundice, being rather the Ef-
fects than Cause of the Disease; em-
ploys a Limb of the Law, that is 
|P_28
dwindled to an insignificant Branch 
of Physic; who assumes the Title of 
Doctor, tho he is much better qua-
lify'd for a Jack-pudding, having a 
Genius peculiarly adapted to Mi-
mic, and attempts to ape that great 
Practitioner Dr. Radcliff in his Prog-
nostics, assuring his Patients, that by 
such a time they need not despair of 
their being perfectly reliev'd, which 
generally happens according to his 
Predictions; for he seldom fails of cur-
ing ing 'em of all Distempers, having no 
less than AEscalapius for a Precedent, 
who thought it not worth while to 
attempt prolonging the Lives of those 
that were enfeebled, and exhausted, 
lest they should live to beget Chil-
dren as infirm as themselves, and so 
be render'd unfit Members for any 
Society. He, without a long Demur, 
pronounces the poor Hydropical Pa-
tient to be in a fair way of Recove-
ry, gives him great hopes to expect 
a Cure in a few days, prescribes your 
Gummy Resinous Cathartics, which 
render'd the Crasis of the Blood more 
unfit for assimilating its Serum, by 
weakning Digestion, and producing 
|P_29
Crudities; which brought on a com-
pleat Apoplexy, that in six hours 
time after the Dose was administred, 
carry'd off the Patient. In the place 
of which, had he evacuated the Se-
rum by proper Remedies, prevented 
its farther Encrease by fortifying 
and corroborating the Stomach, re-
stor'd and strengthen'd the Crasis of 
the Blood, dislodg'd the Viscous Mat-
ter that adher'd to the Plicae, or Folds 
of the Stomach, by warm attenua-
ting Stomachical Specifics; the poor 
unfortunate Man might have now 
been in perfect Health. 

Others again mightily rely on the 
Use of Clysters, and such as are of a 
sharp, acrid, irritating Nature, to relieve 
those Affections of the Head, Epi-
lepsys, Lethargys, Palsys, Apoplexys, 
and the like; Revulsionis ergo. But 
this Method of deriving Humours 
from one place to its opposite, is 
now laid aside, as before hinted: for 
in this Case the Intestines themselves 
are Paralytically affected, and will 
scarce retain a Clyster, if at that time 
injected: if it does remain, it only 
|P_30
affects the Inteslines and Primæ Viæ,
and is not the least serviceable in a-
verting Vapours from the Head. 

Cupping and Scarifying is wonder-
fully in vogue with some, for the 
above Reasons, of Revulsion and De-
rivation: but the Attraction of the 
Cupping-Glass has so little Effect, the 
Number who use them so few, and 
those so inconsiderable, 'tis scarce 
worth while to spend time to con-
fute such erroneous Methods. 

The next thing that comes to be 
consider'd, is Blisters; which too 
many mightily rely on, without re-
flecting on the ill Effects they have 
in some Cases, and on some Constitu-
tions; especially those of a Scorbu-
tic Habit of Body, in extreme hot 
Constitutions, when for the want of 
Serum the Blood boils. In old Per-
sons, whose Balsamic Particles of the 
Blood are for the most part exhausted, 
and too great a Quantity of corro-
siveSerum is left; to such the Appli-
cation of Blisters does more hurt than 
good: for by the too great Action 
|P_31
of the Caustic Salts that enter the 
Pores, and insinuate themselves into 
the Mass of Blood, the Parts are so 
stimulated, as to cause violent Stran-
guries, voiding of bloody Urine; 
forcing also Substances of Matter, 
resembling Fat, so large as would be 
thought incredible, to pass through 
so narrow a Passage as that of the 
Urethra. Now since the Inconve-
nience that necessarily attends such 
Methods is so great, and the Advan-
tage that may reasonably be expected 
from 'em so small; they are fitter for 
the Practice of Empirics and Scara-
mouches, than regular Physicians: But 
I would not tire the Reader's Pa-
tience with a long and tedious Dis-
course, and shall therefore only add 
a few more Observations, and con-
clude. 

[}Obs. 5. }]
A Cornish Man, of about Thirty 
Six Years of Age, who had been 
very much addicted to those violent 
Exercises of Cudgelling, Wrestling, 
Hurling, for which that County, 
during the time of their Revels, 
|P_32
is very remarkable; quitting his Em-
ploy for the more immediate Service 
of his Queen and Country, goes for 
Flanders; but being unacquainted 
with the Fatigue of several Marches, 
and unaccustom'd to take up with 
such slender Fare, was seiz'd with a 
slow lingring Fever, which terminated 
in a Deprivation of the Use of his 
Limbs. After which manner he 
continued in the Hospital during the 
whole Campaign; at the breaking 
up of which, he was committed to 
the Surgeon's Care of the respective 
Regiment, till the opening of the 
next Campaign; and then was again 
receiv'd into the Hospital, in a much 
worse Condition than when he left 
it, being perfectly emaciated, having 
crusty Ulcers on the Backs of his 
Hands, and on his Shin-Bones, re-
sembling Venereal Nodes; the Bones 
also carious, several Absesses form'd 
on the Head, with fiery Botches or 
Carbuncles, occasion'd by the sharp 
Caustic Lixivious Salts, with which 
the Blood abounded. He fell under 
my Care, but all means proving in-
effectual, he died in a few days. I 
|P_33
indeed suspected his Case at first to 
be Venereal; but being a Person 
bearing a good Character, and pro-
testing he had been at no time 
conversant with Women, I thought it 
would be requisite to endeavour to 
discover from what Cause those dire-
ful Effects arose. In order thereto, I 
first resolv'd to examine the Brain, 
and had no sooner made my Incision 
on the Scalp, but I perceiv'd the Cra-
nium to be foul and carious; which, 
in taking it off, I found had reach'd 
not only the inner Lamina, but also 
both Meninges, and even the Corti-
cal Substance of the Brain: in per-
forming which, notwithstanding there 
issued a vast Quantity of Serum, yet 
in the third Ventricle, by the Glan-
dula Pinealis, was lodg'd near a Pint 
of Lymph, and that so very viscous 
and ropy as to be deny'd the least 
Passage. In the Infundibulum was 
also an incredible Quantity of vis-
cidSerum, much thicker than the 
first; and the Glandula pituitariafil-
trated like a cancerated Gland. This 
Discovery contributed mightily to 
my Satisfaction; and 'twas very evi-
|P_34
dent that the Train of this poor Fel-
low's Misfortunes proceeded not 
from any Venereal Cause, but from 
those Falls and Bruises he had for-
merly receiv'd; which when Nature 
was indulged, the Spirits buoy'd up, 
the Fibres firm and elastic, each part 
could better perform its Function, 
and so prevent the ensuing Disease: 
but when reduced to mean Diet and 
scanty Allowance, expos'd to Heats 
and Colds, inseparable Concomitants 
of a Military Life; the Spirits flag 
and become languid, the Fibres lose 
their wonted Elasticity, and become 
lax, the Blood loses its Tone; in short, 
the whole Animal Oeconomy is so 
disorder'd, that the vigorous Attack 
of a Disease meets with a very feeble 
Repulse. For by these severe Shocks 
the Lymphatics and sanguiferous Ves-
sels being frequently broke, the ex-
travasated Blood and Lymph is dis-
charg'd into the Sinus's of the Brain, 
where it coagulates and becomes so 
viscous as not to be able to pass those 
narrow Canals, but lie congested there, 
and is not only the Source of 
|P_35
dreadful Symptoms, but the Cause 
of Death it self. 

[}Obs. 6. }]
A certain Gentlewoman of Ghent
in Flanders accompanying her Spouse 
to Batavia, of which he was Major 
Commandant till his Decease, in 
her Return from thence was taken 
very ill; for which Indisposition the 
Surgeon of the Vessel advised her to 
the Use of the Cold Bath: but whe-
ther owing to his Ignorance or her 
Neglect, she omitted emerging her 
Head. She was no sooner got out of 
the Bath, but immediately her Head 
and Face was so swoln, as to deprive 
her both of Sight, Speech, and the Use 
of all her Limbs. At her Arrival at 
Amsterdam, Consultations were held 
by the best Physicians concerning 
her Case, with very good Success as 
to the abating the Swelling of her 
Head, and Recovery of Speech; but 
as for retrieving the Use of her Limbs, 
she found no manner of Benefit, but 
remain'd void of all Sense and Motion. 
Thus despairing of Help, she return'd 
to Ghent, and apply'd her self to the 
|P_36
Physicians of the French Hospital, 
who were then in that Garison, but 
with as little Advantage as the former. 
In this Condition was she for some 
Years confin'd to her Bed, and reduc'd 
to a meer Skeleton; the Bones of the 
Carpus and Metacarpus, those of the 
Tarsus and Metatarsus being distorted 
to a Deformity; nay, the very Pha-
langes of the Fingers and Toes were 
dislocated by the Contraction of the 
Tendons. She then had recourse to 
the Town Physicians: but neither 
their Inunctions of penetrating Oils, 
camphorated Spirits; their Aroma-
tics, or volatile Sudorifics, to cor-
rect and discharge this peccant Mat-
ter, that intercepted the nervous 
Fluid; nor their Decoctions of the 
Woods, Fomentations or Hot Baths,
avail'd any thing: of she entertain'd 
no longer Hopes of being reliev'd. 

But after that Memorable Battle 
at Ramillies, on May 23. 1706. the 
Victory being obtain'd over the 
Duke of Bavaria, by that Victorious 
General, his Grace the Duke of Marl-
borough, which occasion'd the speedy 
Reduction of all the Netherlands,
|P_37
the British Hospital remov'd to Ghent;
and I accidentally took Lodgings 
under the Roof of this miserable 
Gentlewoman, who being inform'd 
I belong'd to that Hospital, was ve-
ry importunate with me to use my 
utmost Endeavours to remove her 
Indisposition. 

Her Case being very uncommon, 
and the Success precarious, I could 
not promise much to raise her Expec-
tations; yet being unwilling to dis-
courage her, I took my leave with 
an Assurance of considering her Case, 
and get the Opinion of other Phy-
sicians, whom I consulted: but their 
concluding that 'twas a perfect Atro-
phy, dissuaded me from attempting 
that which was so improbable of be-
ing accomplish'd. 

My last Observation suggested to 
me, that this Numbness and Dead-
ness proceeded from the Obstruction 
of the nervous Fluid, occasion'd by 
the viscous glutinous Matter lodg'd 
in the Sinus's of the Brain; which, 
if it could be diluted by the Power of 
Medicine, so as to be carry'd off by 
its proper Vessels, I then thought I 
|P_38
might expect Success: so communi-
cating my Thoughts of her Case, and 
the Method I design'd to prosecute 
for the Cure, to the ingenious Dr. 
Laurence, then Physician General to 
her Majesty's Forces in Flanders, he 
approv'd of my Method, as the most 
probable to recover my Patient, and 
establish my Character. 

This encourag'd me to undertake 
the Cure. What flush'd me more with 
Hopes of Success, was, that in a 
short time her Menstrua flow'd; which 
before, during the whole time of her 
Illness, were totally suppress'd: after 
which, in three Weeks time, she was 
capable (with the Assistance of ano-
ther's Arm) to walk to Church, and 
by degrees acquir'd her former 
Health and Strength, to the great 
Surprize of all that knew her deplo-
rable Case. In a short time after she 
was marry'd, and deliver'd of a strong 
and healthy Child. 

This confirm'd me in the Opinion, 
that let a Chronical Case be ne'er so 
intricate, 'tis in the power of Me-
dicines (if rightly apply'd) to re-
move it, supposing there's not too 
|P_39
great a Petrefaction, or Loss of Sub-
stance in the Parts affected: For the 
Truth of which, I could produce se-
veral Instances, were it not a Di-
gression from my present Design. 

[}Obs. 7. }]
A robust young Fellow, at the Siege 
of Brussels, Anno Dom. 1706. receiv-
ing a Shot thro the Metatarsus;af-
ter the Wound was well digested, 
Suppuration promoted, and he in a 
fair way of Recovery, only com-
plaining mightily for want of Sleep, 
the Physician, in his Tour of Vi-
sits, order'd him a gentle Hypnotic
Draught: but the Apothecary's 
Man, in distributing the Medicines, 
gave him also to the Quantity of se-
ven Grains of Laudanum (Mistakes 
of which kind in the BritishHos-
pital are seldom or ever known) 
the next Morning, to my Surprize, 
I found him dead. The Nurse in-
form'd me what Pills he had taken, 
how jocose, pleasant, and merrily 
dispos'd he was, that he sung very 
cheerfully, and a short while after 
dozed away. 

|P_40
The next day, in opening his 
Head to see what Discovery I could 
make, I no sooner reach'd the Me-
ninges, but I found some of the Ves-
sels distended to a prodigious degree, 
others burst, from whence issued an 
incredible Quantity of Blood; and 
from the Sinus's came (as near as I 
could judg) to the Quantity of three 
Quarts that was extravasated. 

Here's an Instance of an Apoplexy
from Laudanum, which convinces 
me that its Narcotic or HypnoticFa-
culty proceeded neither from an 
occult Quality, or intense Coldness, 
either by coagulating or environing 
the Particles of Blood or Spirits, and 
so preventing their Motion: for since 
by a Chymical Analysis we find it 
gives a copious Quantity of fetid 
Oil and Volatile Spirit, it plain-
ly consutes that Assertion of its be-
ing cold; but on the contrary, it dis-
solves the Texture of the Blood, ren-
ders the Humours more fluid, hur-
ries the Spirits into disorderly Mo-
tions, and the Heart, by its repeated 
Systole, projects the Blood with too 
great a Velocity to the Brain. 

|P_41
Indeed when the Opium begins 
first of all to insinuate it self, it 
rarifies the Arterial Blood: this be-
ing rarified, the Spirits then, not so 
much fetter'd with bloody Particles, 
are in a greater quantity, and with 
more ease, secern'd by the Glands of 
the Brain, and convey'd in a greater 
Copia by the Nerves thro all Parts of 
the Body; which produces that Pas-
sion of the Mind, Joy: but when by 
this Rarefaction the Arteries are so 
distended, as to compress the Nerves, 
and retard the Circulation of their 
Fluid, Comatose Distempers must 
there necessarily be produc'd. Hence 
it is, that administring Opium in the 
beginning of Fevers, the Small-Pox, 
and the like, where the Blood is 
already in too great a Ferment, 
instead of answering the Intention 
of composing the Patient, throws 
him into Deliriums, and even Madness
it self, hurries him headlong and dis-
tracted out of the World. 

|P_42
[}Obs. 8. }]
Mr. Kilbraith, a Merchant of Bris-
tol, about Forty Five Years of Age, 
labouring for many Years under a 
Hypocondriac Melancholy, continu'd 
under the Physicians hands for a 
long time; but was so far from reap-
ing the least Benefit from their Pre-
scriptions, that he daily declin'd, and 
lost his Appetite; nay, the very Sight and 
Smell of Meats were so offensive 
as to create a Nausea, till at length he 
had contracted a Complication of 
Diseases: then he committed himself 
to my Care, who in a short time had 
the good Fortune to be the Instru-
ment of his Recovery. 

Some time after having an Affair 
at the Bath, and there meeting with 
a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, 
he was prevail'd upon to bathe him-
self; but what with sweating, the 
Vitriolic, Sulphureous, or Bitumi-
nousEffluvia of the Waters, he be-
came faint, heavy, and render'd al-
most Lethargic: however relying too
much on the Strength of Nature, he 
neglected the Use of Means, till one 
|P_43
Night being taken with a Contraction 
of the Nerves, and soon after seiz'd 
with a few Convulsive Paroxysms; 
I was sent for the Morning follow-
ing, and advis'd him to air and ex-
ercise himself with gentle Riding: 
he no sooner attempted to rise, and 
plac'd his Feet on the cold Floor, 
but was immediately seiz'd with a 
violent Fit of an Apoplexy, and in a 
moment became cold, stiff, and to 
all Appearance lifeless. At this sur-
prizing Accident, the whole Family 
ran out to rally some of the Neigh-
bourhood to their Assistance, left me 
alone, where I accidentally found a 
small Bottle of Spirits of Harts-horn, 
which I pour'd down his Throat; and 
at their Return I desir'd he might have 
a Friction all over his Body: which 
prov'd so successful, that I soon per-
ceiv'd a Pulsation and Respiration. 
I then took Sixteen Ounces of Blood 
from the Temporal Artery, and in 
less time than ever I observ'd from 
the Arm; after which, I prescrib'd 
what I thought proper for his Case. 
Other Physicians who were also sent 
|P_44
for, came, and to my Face approv'd 
of my Method of treating him, but 
after my Departure they ridicul'd it 
as mischievous and hurtful, saying 
'twas the only way to draw the Dis-
temper to, and confirm it in the Head. 
Whether Ignorance or Malice had the 
Ascendant, or whether equal Parts 
of both contributed to furnish their 
Upper Rooms, it matters not: but 
my Affairs obliging me to go a few 
Miles from thence, I desir'd the Sur-
geon, if he was threatned with a re-
turning Fit, to introduce his Lancet 
into the same Orifice, and take such 
a Quantity as might be requisite; 
but at the Attack of the next Fit, 
these judicious Gentlemen preven-
ted the Surgeon, and dissuaded the 
Friends, by amusing them with the 
dangerous Consequence that must 
necessarily accrue, till the Blood 
flew impetuously out of the Mouth 
and Nose; and then, when 'twas too 
late, they consented. Howe-
ver, after this second Discharge he 
immediately recover'd his Sense and 
Speech. At my Return, his Friends 
inform'd me what had happen'd, and 
|P_45
that 'twas owing to those Physicians, 
that they had not strictly observ'd 
my Method; at which being about 
to leave him, I was prevail'd upon, by 
his importuning me so earnestly, to 
tarry. I was entirely of the Opi-
nion, that the Vessels of the Brain 
were burst; but however I desir'd a 
Consultation with Dr. Bave of Bath,
and acquainted him with my Pro-
ceedings, which he approv'd of, and 
gave him my Opinion of the Des-
perateness of his Case, which he also 
fear'd. But the other Physicians, 
tho their Companies and Opinions 
were desir'd, yet thought fit, as they 
had sneak'd off, to abscond, who be-
ing too conscious to themselves of 
the irreparable Prejudice they had al-
ready done; giving only this shuffling, 
trifling Excuse, That truly Dr. Bave
was so singular as to consult with 
none but such as had been educated 
at Oxford; whereas that ingenious,
as well as ingenuous Gentleman, 
who is a Credit to the University 
where educated, an Advantage to 
the Town where he resides, and to 
such that have Recourse there for 
|P_46
the Benefit of the Waters, regards 
the Qualifications of a Physician 
more than the Place where quali-
fy'd. After some Medicines pre-
scrib'd, the Doctor returns without 
entertaining the least Hopes of his 
Recovery; but the Patient resting 
well that Night, his former Physi-
cians concluded then he was in a 
fair way of doing well. I took li-
berty to inform 'em how great Stran-
gers they were to his present Case; 
and that when they were in the 
greatest Expectations of his being 
out of danger, that then they would 
have most reason to fear his being 
snatch'd away: which happen'd ac-
cordingly; for the very ensuing 
Night, whilst jocose and merry with 
his Friends, he was seiz'd of a sudden, 
and had just time allow'd him to be-
queath his Soul to God that gave it, 
and so expir'd, snorting and discharg-
ing a vast Quantity of Livid Blood 
from his Nostrils. 

This to me is an evident Proof 
that this Gentleman was entirely 
lost by this Neglect, the Disease be-
ing too violent, and too sudden to 
|P_47
be conquer'd by internal Medicines; 
whereas had the Artery been open'd, 
as I order'd, it might have prevented 
the returning Fit. 

[}Obs. 9. }]
Mr. Jeffrey Pinnel, a very consi-
derable Man of the City of Bristol,
returning from Morning-Service, and 
reflecting on the manifold Mercies 
bounteous Heaven had bestow'd on 
him, particularly acknowledged the 
large Share of that inestimable Jew-
el, Health, which from his Infancy 
he had enjoy'd without the least In-
terval of Sickness; and that notwith-
standing he was so much advanc'd 
in Years, he could discern no sensible 
Alteration as to his good Habit of 
Body: but in the mean time, in-
clining his Head with a Design to 
buckle his Shoe, he fell down as 
dead on the Floor; which (being a 
Stone Pavement) made a conside-
rable Contusion on his Forehead. 
He was immediately lifted up, and 
what with Frictions and Cardiac 
Draughts, was recruited to that de-
|P_48
gree, that in the space of three 
Hours he became very sensible; and 
amongst several Physicians that were 
mention'd to him, he was pleas'd to 
send for me, inform'd me of his 
manner of being seiz'd, that he was 
then very Costive, and had a Sup-
pression of Urine; but the Pulse be-
ing not very irregular, I defer'd o-
pening the Artery: so at that time I 
prescrib'd only Laxatives and Diure-
tics, and took my leave, desiring him 
to acquaint me at the first Appear-
ance of the returning Fit; which hap-
pen'd the following Morning at Four 
a Clock: at which time the Fit was so 
exceeding severe, that he was almost 
suffocated, and his Face discolour'd 
like one strangled: the Artery being 
then turgid and quick (as it always is 
in those Cases) I immediately took 
away about Sixteen Ounces, which 
I had no sooner done, but he ask'd 
me what I was doing. I order'd him 
to be rais'd out of his Bed (being 
there too much confin'd) and con-
vey'd into a more airy Room; which 
occasion'd him to make Water very 
|P_49
plentifully: But after a strict Enqui-
ry, I found that the Concussion gi-
ven the Brain, and the Symptoms 
attending it were such, that the Ves-
sels must necessarily be broke, and 
that there was but small Hope left 
to expect his Recovery; which I 
freely told his Friends, they being 
very pressing with me to give my 
real Sentiments, and desirous of a 
Consultation, which for their Satis-
faction I approv'd of. So they sent 
for Dr. — at Four in the Morn-
ing, who, notwithstanding he had 
given his Word of Honour to be 
immediately there; yet, after his 
usual way, kept 'em in expectation 
till Eleven, at which time assum-
ing his usual haughty Air (to in-
sinuate himself into the Opinion of 
the Vulgar) he enters; but being in-
form'd who was above, in order for 
a Consultation, this brazen Oracle 
turns on his heel, and pronounces 
these Words, With this I consult, and none 
else, pointing to his Breast, the Tho-
rax being equally as well furnish'd 
with Brain, as the Cranium. But tho 
he was mightily reflected on for this 
|P_50
imperious Air, 'tis every Person's 
Duty to judg charitably, and put the 
most favourable Construction that 
'twill bear: I for my part would im-
pute it to an innate Modesty, being 
conscious of his Ignorance in that 
Case; and that offering his Opi-
nion, would be but exposing him-
self without the lead Service accru-
ing to the Patient: Galen and Hip-
pocrates suiting no more his Genius, 
than Cook or Littleton. But not to 
harp too long on such an untunable 
String, I'll wave this, heartily wish-
ing (for the Benefit of those unfor-
tunate distemper'd Persons that fall 
under his Care) that for the future 
he may have better Success, than 
from his Knowledg in the Faculty 
of Physic can reasonably be ex-
pected. 

I continu'd in the Use of proper 
Means, but for the Reasons before 
mention'd could not expect his Reco-
very; for tho to appearance he was 
much better, yet the next day about 
Eleven in the Forenoon, he fell into 
a cold clammy Sweat, and for the 
Space of almost an Hour shorted 
|P_51
excessively, foam'd at the Mouth, 
and expir'd. 

Some perhaps may say this might 
have as well been omitted as inser-
ted, the Patient dying; but this may 
serve to confirm my Assertion, that 
Arteriotomy is so much preferable to 
Phlebotomy, there being no Parallel 
Instance, that ever the latter had so 
speedy an Effect to recal the Senses. 

The two following Observations, 
tho I formerly publish'd them in a 
Latin Dissertation on this Subject, 
which is annex'd to this Treatise; 
yet for the Benefit of those who are 
not so well acquainted with that 
Language, being so remarkable, I 
could not omit giving them a place 
here in the English Tongue. 

[}Obs. 10. }]
A certain Person, of about Forty 
Years of Age, who had lived luxu-
riously in his Youth, being reduc'd 
to Poverty, and from a thriving 
Tradesman become a private Sen-
tinel, went to bed in perfect Health, 
but the next Morning was found 
dead. I resolv'd to open and exa-
|P_52
mine his Head, and had no sooner 
sawn thro the Cranium, and reach'd 
the Meninges, but the Blood sprung 
out from those torn Vessels with 
that Violence, as if an Amputation 
had been perform'd on the Leg or 
Arm of a living Person; which had 
it been timely discharg'd, by open-
ing the Artery, his Life might have

A young Fellow about Thirty, 
who had been sickly for a conside-
rable time; but when on the Reco-
very, I ask'd him, how he did? he 
told me, he was tolerably well: but 
in a quarter of an hours time News 
was brought me that he was dead. 
I immediately went to him, disco-
ver'd a small Respiration, and could 
just perceive a Pulsation in the Tem-
poral Arteries, which I open'd on 
each side; and after having bled very 
freely, he presently began to dis-
course with me: two hours after I 
took more Blood from the same O-
rifices, and a third time a considera-
ble Quantity: by which means, 
|P_53
with the use of warm comfortable 
Medicines, he perfectly recover'd. 

Thus during the time of my be-
ing in Flanders, as there were many 
Cases of this nature offer'd, so I 
never neglected embracing all Op-
portunities by them, which more 
and more confirm'd me in the Opi-
nion of Arteriotomy.

[}Obs. 12. }]
I shall only add one Instance more 
of the Mismanagement of Diseases, 
and the irregular Administration of 
Medicines, and conclude. 'Twas 
on the famous William Penn Esq; who 
being of a Plethoric Habit of Body, 
and Lethargic, was one day seiz'd 
with Convulsions at his Table, and 
falter'd in his Speech: immediately 
their Family Physician was sent for, 
who took the usual Method of treat-
ing him, till at length it terminated 
in an Intermitting Fever, which was 
so ill manag'd, that 'twas six Weeks 
before he could be removed to his 
Country House. Being at Bristol
six Months after, he was seiz'd with a-
|P_54
nother Fit of the same kind, but 
much more severe: a Learned Phy-
sician was then employ'd, who, 
scorning to jog on in the old beaten 
Lane, Pack-horse like, was more 
pompous in his Prescriptions; as 
appear'd by ordering his Antilethar-
gic or famous Cephalic Powder, which 
by virtue of an occult Quality, 
(could it but have insinuated it self 
into every Crevice of the Cranium) 
would have work'd Wonders: but 
these Circumforaneous Scouts want-
ing the Parole, could not pass, the 
Ports of the Os Crebriforme being so 
well guarded with Nerves, Veins, Ar-
teries, and so closely lin'd with Mem-
branes; so that this Specific Powder 
not answering Expectation, this wor-
thy Gentleman left him, who after 
some moderate days Journeys arriv'd 
at his Country Seat at Ruscomb near 
Reading, where he was seiz'd with 
a third Fit. Their Physician was 
then sent for from London, who pro-
secuted his former Method, only 
with this difference, that he order'd 
Cupping, Scarifying; and then ap-
plying the strongest Epispastics, this 
|P_55
barbarous Treatment caus'd dismal 
Stranguries; and the little Urine he 
made was with great Pain and much 
Difficulty, and of a bloody Tinc-
ture, intermix'd with coagulated 
Matter, resembling Lumps of Fat, 
so large, that 'twould be thought 
incredible to pass the Urethra. By 
this Severity (tho entirely owing to 
a good Constitution) he was not 
kill'd, yet it confirm'd a Hydrocepha-
lus or Dropsy in his Head, which 
caus'd a sensible Decay thro all Parts 
of his Body, depriv'd him of his 
Speech, and the use of his Senses: 
and in this desponding State the 
Doctor left him. 

All which Misfortunes might have 
been prevented by bleeding in the 
Artery, at the first Appearance of 
the Disease, and falling in with my Mea-
sures before mention'd. 

I was then sent for, and succeeded 
so Well, that in a few days he was 
apparently better; so I left him to 
the Care of his Apothecary, and in 
about ten days time paying him a 
second Visit, I found him quite a-
nother Man: he had reassum'd his 
|P_56
wonted Briskness and Alacrity; and 
thus continu'd for some Months in a 
very good State of Health, till this 
unhappy Accident: having two Fon-
tinels betwixt the Scapula's, on one 
of which a Protuberance rose like 
a Boil, which threw him into a vio-
lent Fever; this Tumor encreas'd to 
a prodigious Size, extending it self 
from the lower Angle of the Scapula,
all over the Clavicle. My being sent 
for to Bristol, to visit an antient La-
dy (who had formerly been my Pa-
tient and best Benefactrix) oblig'd him 
to make use of the former Physician, 
and a Metropolitan Surgeon: but a 
Friend of Mr. Penn being very impor-
tunate with me, I waited on him with 
all Expedition, found they had ap-
ply'dCataplasms in order to bring it 
to Suppuration, and had attempted to 
lay the Abscess open, but thro Fear 
had only scratch'd the Teguments. I 
then took the Probe, and introduc'd 
it eight or nine Inches, and made a 
deep Incision, from whence a con-
siderable Quantity of Pus discharg'd 
it self. Then I order'd a Digestive to 
destroy whatever Fungus might re-
|P_57
main; by which means he was im-
mediately freed from the Fever, with-
out the least Occasion of being 
cramb'd with febrifuge Draughts, 
Powders, and Bolus's that lay so plen-
tifully prepar'd for him; so I left him 
to the Care of a Surgeon in Read-
ing, an ingenious Man, who com-
pleated the Cure effectually: and 
now he enjoys as large a Measure 
of Health as ever. 

This Operation of Arteriotomy,
that the Generality are so timerous 
and cautious of attempting, I've not 
only perform'd and order'd for A-
dults, but even on Infants them-
selves. One particularly who fell un-
der my Care, was the Child of a 
distemper'd Parent, who as soon 
as born was attended with Con-
vulsions, and at six Weeks old was 
seiz'd with one so violent, that 
none had the least room to hope for 
Life: but at the taking away a 
small Quantity of Blood from the 
Artery, the Child was in an instant 
reliev'd, look'd chearful, pleasant, 
and immediately took the Breast, 
which for some time before the Fit 
|P_58
he had refus'd, and so with the Use 
of proper Medicines perfectly reco-
verd. 

This Treatise I don't doubt but 
will meet with some who will ap-
prove of it, as well as other preju-
dic'd Persons that will be as ready 
to contemn and condemn it. But 
what I've writ was entirely owing 
to a Sense of my Duty to my Fel-
low-Creatures, without either con-
sulting the Applause of the former, 
or valuing in the least the malicious 
Censures of the latter.

Candidus imperti; si non, his utere
