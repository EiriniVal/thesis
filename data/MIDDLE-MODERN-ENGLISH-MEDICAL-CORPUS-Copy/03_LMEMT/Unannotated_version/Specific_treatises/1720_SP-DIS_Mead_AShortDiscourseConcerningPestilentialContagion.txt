[}TO THE 
RIGHT HONOURABLE 
James Craggs, Esq; 
ONE OF 
His Majesties principal 
Secretaries of State. }]SIR, 

[^Decorative frame around the letter I.^]I Most humbly of- 
fer to You my 
Thoughts con- 
cerning the Pre- 
vention of the Plague, 
which I have put together 
|P_
by your Command. As soon 
as you was pleased to sig- 
nify to me, in his Majestie's
Absence; that their Excel- 
lencies the Lords Justices
thought it necessary for the 
Publick Safety, upon the 
Account of the Sickness
now in France, that proper 
Directions should be drawn 
up to defend our selves 
from such a Calamity; I 
most readily undertook the 
Task, though upon short 
Warning, and with little 
Leisure: I have therefore ra- 
ther put down the principal 
Heads of Caution, than a 
Set of Directions in Form. 

|P_
The first, which relate 
to the performing Qua- 
rentines, &c. You, who are 
perfectly versed in the Histo- 
ry of Europe, will see are 
agreable to what is pra- 
ctised in other Countries, 
with some new Regulations. 
The next, concerning the 
suppressing Infection here, 
are very different from the 
Methods taken in former 
Times among Us, and from 
what they commonly Do A- 
broad: But, I persuade 
my self, will be found agre- 
able to Reason. 

|P_
I most heartily wish, that 
the wise Measures, the Go- 
vernment has already ta- 
ken, and will continue to 
take, with Regard to the 
former of these, may make 
the Rules about the latter
unnecessary: However it is 
fit, we should be always pro- 
vided with proper Means 
of Defence against so ter- 
rible an Enemy. 

May this short Essay be 
received as one Instance, a- 
mong many others, of the 
Care, you always shew for 
Your Country; and as a 
|P_
Testimony of the great E- 
steem and Respect, with 
which I have the Honour 
to be,
SIR, 
Your most obedient, 
Most humble Servant, 
R. MEAD.

[}PART I.
OF THE 
NATURE
OF 
CONTAGION. }]
THAT the Reasonableness 
of any Method, which 
shall be proposed to pre- 
vent the spreading of  Con- 
tagious Diseases, may the better ap- 
pear, it is necessary to premise some- 
what in general concerning Conta- 
|P_2
gion and the Manner, by which it 
acts. 

Contagion is propagated by 
three Causes, the Air; Diseased 
Persons; and Goods transported from 
infected Places. 

We shall therefore first enquire 
what alteration of the Air it is, 
that makes it insectious; and then, 
by what Means it communicates its 
noxious Quality to other Bodies. 

The ancientest and best Authors 
of Physick, who lived in a Coun- 
try more exposed to these Calami- 
ties than ours, observed the Con- 
stitution of the Air, which preceded 
Pestilential Fevers, to be great Heats
attended with much Rain and  South- 
erly Winds[/1./] And one of Them 
takes particular Notice, that no o- 
|P_3
ther than a moist and hot Tempera- 
ment of the Air brings the Plague; 
and that the Duration of this Con- 
stitution is the Measure of the Vio- 
lence of the Distemper [/2./]. 

The Natural History of several 
Countries confirms this Observati- 
on; in Africa particularly, if Show- 
ers fall during the sultry Heats of 
July and August, the Plague ensues 
thereupon, with which whosoever 
is infected hardly escapes [/3./]. 

It has besides been remarked in 
all Times, that the Stinks of  stag- 
nating Waters in hot Weather,  pu- 
trid Exhalations from the Earth; 
and above all, the Corruption of 
dead Carcasses lying unburied, have 
occasioned infectious Diseases. 

|P_4
From hence it appears to be a 
Concurrence of Causes, that pro- 
duces Diseases of this Kind; which 
must not only meet, but exert their 
Force together for a considerable 
time. And when this happens, 
their first Effect is a Degree of  Stag- 
nation in the Air, which is after- 
wards followed by Corruption and 
Putrefaction. 

And upon this account it is, that 
those Countries are chiefly liable to 
these Calamities, where not only 
the Heats are very great, and the 
Weather continues long in the same 
State; but the Winds (the Use of 
which is by Motion to purify the 
Air) do not shift and change so of- 
ten as they do in Northern Climates. 

IndeedPlagues seem to be of the 
Growth of the Eastern and Southern
|P_5
Parts of the World, and to be trans- 
mitted from them into colder Cli- 
mates by the Way of Commerce. 
Nor do I think, that in this Island
particularly there is any one In- 
stance of a Pestilential Disease a- 
mong us of great Consequence; 
which we did not receive from o- 
ther infected Places. 

This I the rather mention, be- 
cause it is a common Opinion, and 
propagated by Authors of great 
Name, that we are usually visited with 
the Plague once in 30 or 40 
Years; which is a mere Fancy with- 
out any Foundation either in Rea- 
son or Experience: and therefore 
People ought to be delivered from 
the Subjection to such vain Fears. 

On the contrary, though we 
have had several Strokes of this 
kind, yet there are Instances of 
|P_6
bad Contagions from abroad being 
brought over to us, which have 
proved less malignant here by our 
Air not being disposed to receive 
such Impressions. 

TheSweating Sickness, called the 
Sudor Anglicus and Febris Ephemera 
Britannica, because it was common- 
ly thought to have taken its Rise 
here, was most probably of a foreign 
Original, and no other than a 
Plague abated in its Violence by the 
mild Temperament of our Climate. 

For, we learn from Histories, that 
the first time this was felt here, 
which was in the Year 1485, it be- 
gan in the Army, with which King 
Henry VII. came from France, 
and landed in Wales[/4./]; and it was 
then thought to have been brought 
|P_7
into France from the famous Siege 
of Rhodes by the Turks 3 or 4 Years 
before. And of the four Returns, 
which this has made since that 
Time; two, viz. those in the Years 
1527, and 1528, may very justly 
be suspected to have been owing to 
the Pestilence, which at those Times 
raged in Italy, particularly at  Flo- 
rence and Naples[/5./]. And the others 
were very probably from a Turkish
Infection. 

I call this Distemper a Plague
with lessened Force, because the 
Symptoms of it were of that kind, 
though in a less Degree; as great 
Faintness and Inquietudes, inward 
Burning, Pain in the Head, a  De- 
lirium &c. All which were accom- 
panied with profuse Sweats, and the 
Disease lasted but 24 hours. And 
|P_8
though for want of Care and due 
Management many died of it; yet, 
as a learned and wise Historian[/6./]
observes, It appeared rather to be a 
surprize of Nature than obstinate to 
Remedies, for if the Patient was 
kept warm with temperate Cordials, 
he commonly recovered. 

And I cannot but take Notice, 
as a Confirmation of what I have 
been advancing, that we had here 
the same kind of Fever in the Year 
1713, about the Month of  Sep- 
tember, which was called the  Dun- 
kirk Fever, as being brought by 
our Soldiers from that Place; where 
it was indeed a Malignant Disease 
attended with a Diarrhaea, Vomit- 
ing, &c. and probably had its Ori- 
ginal from the Pestilential Distem- 
per, which some time before broke 
|P_9
out at Dantzick and Hamburgh: 
But with us was much more mild, 
beginning only with a Pain in the 
Head, and by very easy Means 
went off in large Sweats, after a 
Day's Confinement. 

There being in every Air a 
greater Disposition to Contagion at 
one Time than another, we have 
indeed sometimes felt this Calami- 
ty with greater Fury; as particular- 
ly the last time in the Year 1665; 
when it continued in this City a- 
bout ten Months, and swept away 
by computation 97306 Persons: 
But it was generally allowed, that 
the Contagion came by Cotton im- 
ported from Turkey[/7./]; and the long 
Duration of it, I believe, may justly 
be charged up the unhappy Ma- 
nagement of infected Houses, which 
|P_10
was then directed by Publick Au- 
thority; as I shall shew anon. 

And the History of the most ter- 
rible of all the Plagues, that ever were 
in these Parts of the World, which 
was that in the Year 1349, gives 
a manifest Proof from whence all 
Europe may trace the Origine of 
these Evils, viz. from Asia: for 
[/8./] This taking its Rise in China in 
the Year 1346, advanced through 
the East Indies to Syria, Turkey, 
Ã†gypt, Greece, Africa, &c. In 1347 
some Ships from the Levant carried 
it to Sicily, Pisa, Genoa, &c. In 
1348 it got into Savoy, Provence, 
Dauphiny, Catalonia, Castile, &c. 
In 1349 it seized England,  Scot- 
land, Ireland, and Flanders; and 
in the next place Germany,  Hun- 
gary, and Denmark; and in all 
|P_11
these Countries made most incredi- 
ble Havock. 

But to return to the Considerati- 
on of the Air, which we left in a 
putrid State: It is to be observed, 
that Putrefaction is a kind of Fer- 
mentation, and that all Bodies in 
a Ferment emit a volatile active Spi- 
rit, of Power to agitate, and put 
into intestine Motions, that is, to 
change the Nature of other Flu- 
ids into which it insinuates it self. 

It were easy to shew from the 
best Theory of Fevers [/9./], how the 
Alterations made in the Blood this 
Way will favour Pestilential Diseases, 
by rendring the Body obnoxious to 
them: But the Digression would 
be too great. 

|P_12
THIS is one step towards  Conta- 
gion. The next, as it seems to me, 
proceeds after this Manner. The 
Blood in all Malignant Fevers, es- 
pecially Pestilential ones, at the lat- 
ter End of the Disease, does like 
Fermenting Liquors throw off a 
great Quantity of active Particles 
upon the several Glands of the Bo- 
dy, particularly upon those of the 
Mouth and Skin, from which the 
Secretions are naturally the most 
constant and large. These, in  Pe- 
stilential Cases, although the Air 
be in a right State, will generally 
infect those, who are very near to 
the sick Person; otherwise are soon 
dispersed and lost: But when in an 
evil Disposition of This they meet 
with the subtle Parts, its Corrup- 
tion has generated, by uniting 
with them they become much more 
active and powerful, and likewise 
|P_13
more durable and lasting, so as to 
form an Infectious Matter capable 
of conveying the Mischief to a great 
Distance from the diseased Body, 
out of which it was produced. 

They who know what strange 
Attractions and Combinations are 
made by volatile Spirits will under- 
standing this Reasoning; especially if 
they consider, how easily all kinds 
of Effluvia are diffused in a warm 
Air, such as we have described an 
Infectious one to be; and further, 
of how penetrating a Force the fi- 
nest Parts of Animal Juices are; of 
which the strange Stench of a mor- 
tified Limb, upon a Body yet liv- 
ing, will convince any one. 

A corrupted State of Air is with- 
out doubt necessary to give these 
Contagious Atoms their full Force; 
for otherwise it were not easy to 
|P_14
conceive how the Plague, when 
once it had seized any Place, should 
ever cease, but with the Destructi- 
on of all the Inhabitants: Which 
is readily accounted for by suppo- 
sing an Emendation of the Quali- 
ties of the Air, and the restoring 
of it to a healthy State capable of 
dissipating and suppressing the Ma- 
lignity. 

On the other hand it is evident, 
that Infection is not received from 
the Air it self, however predisposed, 
without the Concurrence of some- 
thing emitted from Infected Per- 
sons; because, by strictly prevent- 
ing all Intercourse of Infected Pla- 
ces with the Neighbourhood, it may 
be effectually kept from spreading: 
Whereas the least Wind must ne- 
cessarily convey whatever noxious 
Quality resides in the Air alone, 
even to a great Distance. Of this 
|P_15
we have had a fresh Proof in the 
present unhappy Plague in France, 
which, by keeping careful Guard, 
was confined for a considerable 
Time within the Walls of  Mar- 
seilles; so that none of the adja- 
cent Villages suffered any thing by 
it; till at length some Persons 
finding Means to escape carried the 
Infection along with them. And 
we find, they have been able, by 
the like Care, still to restrain it 
within moderate Bounds. 

This is the Manner by which 
Infectious Effluvia are generated: 
The Way, by which a sound Person 
receives the Injury, I suppose most 
commonly to be this. These  Conta- 
gious Particles being drawn in with 
the Air we breath, they taint in 
their Passage the Salival Juices, 
which being swallowed down into 
the Stomach presently fix their Ma- 
|P_16
lignity there; as appears from the 
Nausea and Vomiting, with which 
the Distemper often begins its first 
Attacks. Though I make no Que- 
stion but the Blood is also more im- 
mediately affected by hurtful Parti- 
cles being mixed through Inspiration 
with it in the Lungs. 

THE third Way, by which we 
mentioned Contagion to be spread, is 
by Goods transported from infected 
Places. It has been thought so dif- 
ficult to explain the Manner of 
this, that some Authors have ima- 
gined Infection to be performed by 
the Means of Insects, the Eggs of 
which may be conveyed from Place 
to Place, and make the Disease 
when they come to be hatched. As 
this is a supposition grounded upon 
no manner of Observation, so I 
think there is no need to have Re- 
course to it. If, as we have con- 
|P_17
jectured, the Matter of Contagion
be an active Substance, perhaps in 
the Nature of a Salt, generated 
chiefly from the Corruption of a 
Humane Body, it is not hard to 
conceive how this may be lodged 
and preserved in soft, porous Bo- 
dies, which are kept pressed close 
together. 

We all know how long a time 
Perfumes hold their Scent, if wrapt 
up in proper Coverings: And it is 
very remarkable, that the strongest 
of these, like the Matter we are 
treating of, are mostly Animal
Juices, as Mosch, Civet, &c. and 
that the Substances found most fit 
to keep them in, are the very same 
with those which are most apt to 
receive and communicate Infection, 
as, Furrs, Feathers, Silk, Hair, 
Wool, Cotton, Flax, &c. the great- 
est Part of which are likewise of 
|P_18
the Animal Kind; which Remark 
alone may serve to lead Us a little 
into the true Nature of Contagion. 

From all that has been said, it 
appears, I think, very plainly, that 
the Plague is a real Poison, which 
being bred in the Eastern or South- 
ern Parts of the World, maintains 
it self there by circulating from  In- 
fected Persons to Goods; which is 
chiefly owing to the Negligence of 
the People in those Countries, who 
 are stupidly Careless in this Affair: 
That when the Constitution of the 
Air happens to favour Infection, it 
rages there with great Violence; 
That at that Time more especially 
diseased Persons give it to one ano- 
ther, and Contagious Matter is lodg- 
ed in Goods of a loose and soft 
Texture, which being packt up, 
and carried into other Countries, 
let out, when opened, the impri- 
|P_19
soned Seeds of Contagion: And 
lastly, That the Air cannot diffuse 
and spread these to any great Di- 
stance, if Intercourse and Commerce 
with the Place infected be strictly 
prevented.

[}PART II. }]
[}OF THE 
METHODS
TO PREVENT 
CONTAGION. }]
AS it is a satisfaction to 
know, that the Plague is 
not a Native of our Coun- 
try, so this is likewise an 
Encouragement to the utmost Dili- 
gence in finding out Means to keep 
our selves clear from It. 

|P_21
This Caution consists of two 
Parts: The preventing its being 
brought into our Island; And, if 
such a Calamity should happen, The 
putting a stop to its spreading among 
us. 

The first of these is provided 
for by the established Method of 
obliging Ships, that come from 
Infected Places, to perform Quaren- 
tine: As to which I think it neces- 
sary, that the following Rules be 
observed. 

Near to our several Ports, there 
should be Lazarettos built in con- 
venient Places, on little Islands if 
it can so be, for the Reception both 
of Men and Goods, which arrive 
from Places suspected of Infection: 
The keeping Men in Quarentine
on board the Ship being not suffi- 
|P_22
cient; the only Use of which is to 
observe whether any dye among 
them. For Infection may be pre- 
served so long in Cloaths, in which 
it is once lodged, that as much, 
nay more of it, if Sickness conti- 
nues in the Ship, may be brought 
on Shoar at the End than at the be- 
ginning of the 40 Days: Unless 
a new Quarentine be begun every 
time any Person dies; which might 
not end, but with the Destruction 
of the whole Ship's Crew. 

If there has been any  Contagi- 
ous Distemper in the Ship; The 
Sound Men should leave their 
Cloaths; which should be burnt; 
the Men washed and shaved; and 
having fresh Cloaths, should stay 
in the Lazaretto 30 or 40 Days. 
The reason of this is, because Per- 
sons may be recovered from a Di- 
sease themselves, and yet retain 
|P_23
Matter of Infection about them a 
considerable Time; as we fre- 
quently see the Small-Pox taken 
from those, who have several Days 
before passed through the Distem- 
per. 

TheSick, if there be any, should 
be kept in Houses remote from 
the Sound; and some time after 
they are well, should also be washed 
and shaved, and have fresh Cloaths; 
whatever they wore while Sick be- 
ing burnt: And then being remov- 
ed to the Houses of the Sound, 
should continue there 30 or 40 days. 

I am particularly careful to de- 
stroy the Cloaths of the Sick, be- 
cause they Harbour the very  Quint- 
essence of Contagion. A very inge- 
nious Author [/10./] in his admirable 
|P_24
Description of the Plague at  Flo- 
rence in the Year 1348, relates 
what himself saw: That two Hogs
finding in the Streets the Rags, 
which had been thrown out from 
off a poor Man dead of the Disease, 
after snuffling upon them, and tear- 
ing them with their Teeth, fell 
into Convulsions, and dyed in less 
than an Hour. 

If there has been no Sickness in 
the Ship, I see no reason why the 
Men should perform Quarentine. 
Instead of this, they may be washed, 
and their Cloaths aired in the  La- 
zaretto, as Goods, for one Week. 

But the greatest Danger is from 
such Goods, as are apt to retain In- 
fection, such as Cotton, Hemp and 
Flax, Paper or Books, Silk of all 
sorts, Linen, Wool, Feathers, Hair, 
and all kinds of Skins. The Laza- 
|P_25
retto for these should be at a Di- 
stance from that for the Men, 
and they must in convenient Ware- 
houses be unpackt, and exposed, 
as much as may be, to the fresh 
Air for 40 Days. 

This may perhaps seem too long; 
but as we don't know how much 
Time precisely is necessary to purge 
the Interstices of Spongy Substances 
from infectious Matter by fresh Air, 
the Caution cannot be too great in 
this Point: Unless there could be 
a Way found out, without hazard- 
ing Men's Lives, of trying when 
Bodies have done emitting the 
Noxious Fumes; which possibly 
might be done by putting tender 
Animals near to them, particularly 
by setting little Birds upon the ex- 
posed Goods; because it has been 
observed in Times of the Plague, 
that the Country has been forsaken 
|P_26
by the Birds; and those kept in 
Houses have many of them dyed [/11./]. 
But the Use of this Fancy Expe- 
rience only must shew; for I am 
well aware, that all Plagues do not 
indifferently affect all Kinds of liv- 
ing Creatures; on the contrary, 
most are confined to a particular 
Species of them; like the Disease of 
the Black Cattle a few Years since, 
which neither proved Infectious 
to other Brutes, nor to Men. 

I take it for granted, that the 
Goods should be opened, when they 
are put into the Lazaretto, other- 
wise their being there will avail 
nothing. The Misfortune, which 
happened in the Island of Bermudas
about 25 Years since, gives a Proof 
of this; where, as the Account 
|P_27
has been given me by the learned 
Dr. Halley, a Sack of Cotton, put 
on Shoar by Stealth, lay above a 
Month without any Prejudice to 
the People of the House, where it 
was hid; but when it came to be 
distributed among the Inhabitants, 
it carried such a Contagion along 
with it, that the living scarce suf- 
ficed to bury the Dead. 

Indeed as it has been frequently 
experienced, that of all the Goods, 
which harbour Infection, Cotton in 
particular is the most dangerous, 
and Turkey is almost a perpetual 
Seminary of the Plague; I cannot 
but think it highly reasonable, that 
whatever Cotton is imported from 
that Part of the World, should at 
all Times be kept in Quarentine; 
because it may have imbibed  In- 
fection at the Time of its packing 
up, notwithstanding no Mischief 
|P_28
has been felt from it by the Ship's 
Company. 

As all reasonable Provisions should 
be made both for the Sound and 
Sick, who perform Quarentine; so 
the strict keeping of it ought to be 
inforced by the severest Penalties. 
And if a Ship come from any Place, 
where the Plague raged, at the Time 
of the Ship's Departure from it, 
with more than usual Violence, it 
will be the securest Method to Burn
all the Goods, and even the Ship. 

Nor ought this further Caution 
to be omitted, That when the  Con- 
tagion has ceased in any Place by 
the approach of Winter, it will not 
be safe to open a free Trade with 
It too soon: Because there are In- 
stances of the Distemper's being 
stopt by the Winter Cold, and yet 
the Seeds of it not destroyed, but 
|P_29
only kept unactive, till the Warmth 
of the following Spring has given 
them new Life and Force. Thus 
in the great Plague at Genoa near 
60 Years ago, which continued 
part of two Years; the first Sum- 
mer about 10000 dyed; the Win- 
ter following hardly any; but the 
Summer after no less than 60000. 
So likewise the last Plague at  Lon- 
don began the Autumn before the 
Year 1665, and was stopt during 
the Winter by a hard Frost of near 
three Month's Continuance; so 
that there remained no further Ap- 
pearance of it till the ensuing 
Spring [/12./]. Now if Goods brought 
from such a Place should retain a- 
ny of the latent Contagion, there 
will be Danger of their producing 
the same Mischief in the Place, to 
which they are brought, as they 
|P_30
would have caused in that, from 
whence they came. 

But above all it is necessary, that 
the Clandestine Importing of Goods 
be punished with the utmost Ri- 
gour; from which wicked Practice 
I should at this Time apprehend 
more Danger of bringing the  Di- 
sease from France, than by any o- 
ther Way whatsoever. 

These are, I think, the most 
material Points, to which Regard 
is to be had in defending ourselves 
against Contagion from other Coun- 
tries. The particular Manner of 
putting these Directions in Execu- 
tion, as the Visiting of Ships, Re- 
gulation of Lazaretto's, &c. I leave 
to proper Officers, who ought 
sometimes to be assisted herein by 
able Physicians. 

|P_31
The next Consideration is, What 
to do in Case, through a Miscarriage 
in the publick Care, by the Neglect 
of Officers, or otherwise, such a 
Calamity should be suffered to be- 
fall us. 

There is no Evil in the World, 
in which the great Rule of  Resist- 
ing the Beginning, more properly 
takes Place, than in the present 
Case; and yet it has unfortunately 
happened, that the common Steps 
formerly taken have had a direct 
Tendency to hinder the putting this 
Maxim in Practice. 

As the Plague always breaks out 
in some particular Place, it is cer- 
tain, that the Directions of the 
Civil Magistrate ought to be such, 
as to make it as much for the In- 
terest of Families to discover their 
|P_32
Misfortune, as it is, when a House 
is on Fire, to call in the Assistance 
of the Neighbourhood: Whereas 
on the contrary, the Methods taken 
by the Publick, on such Occasions, 
have always had the Appearance of 
a severe Discipline, and even  Punish- 
ment, rather than of a  Compassi- 
onate Care: Which must naturally 
make the Infected conceal the Dis- 
ease as long as was possible. 

The main Import of the Orders
issued out at these Times was, As 
soon as it was found, that any House 
was infected, to keep it shut up, 
with a large red Cross, and Lord 
have Mercy upon us on the Door; 
and Watchmen attending Day and 
Night to prevent any one's going 
in or out, except Physicians,  Surge- 
ons, Apothecaries, Nurses,  Search- 
ers, &c. allowed by Authority: 
And this to continue at least a 
|P_33
Month after all the Family was 
dead or recovered[/13./]. 

It is not easy to conceive a more 
dismal Scene of Misery, than this; 
Families seized with a Distemper, 
which the most of any in the 
World requires Help and Comfort, 
lockt up from all their Acquaint- 
ance; left it may be to the Treat- 
ment of an inhumane Nurse (for 
such are often found at these Times 
about the Sick;) and Strangers to 
every thing but the Melancholy 
sight of the Progress, Death makes 
among themselves; with small 
Hopes of Life, and those mixed 
with Anxiety and Doubt, whether 
it be not better to Dye, than to 
survive the Loss of their best Friends, 
and nearest Relations. 

|P_34
IfFear, Despair, and all  De- 
jection of Spirits dispose the Body 
to receive Contagion, and give it a 
great Power, where it is received, 
as all Physicians agree they do, I 
don't see how a Disease can be 
more enforced, than by such a 
Treatment. 

Nothing can justify such  Cruel- 
ty, but the Plea, that it is for the 
Good of the whole Community, 
and prevents the spreading of  In- 
fection. But this upon due Consi- 
deration will be found quite other- 
wise: For while Contagion is kept 
nursed up in a House, and conti- 
nually encreased by the daily Con- 
quests it makes, it is impossible but 
the Air should by Degrees become 
tainted, which by opening Win- 
dows, &c. will carry the Malig- 
nity first from House to House; 
|P_35
and then from one Street to ano- 
ther. The shutting up Houses in 
this Manner is only keeping so ma- 
ny Seminaries of Contagion, sooner 
or later to be dispersed abroad: 
For the waiting a Month, or longer, 
from the Death of the last Patient 
will avail no more, than keeping 
a Bale of infected Goods unpack'd; 
the Poyson will fly out, whenever 
the Pandora's Box is opened. 

As these Measures were owing to 
the Ignorance of the true Nature 
of Contagion, so they did, I firmly 
believe, contribute very much to 
the long Continuance of the Plague, 
every time they have been practis- 
ed in this City: And no doubt 
they have had as ill Effects in o- 
ther Countries. 

It is therefore no wonder, that 
great Complaints were sometimes 
|P_36
made here against this unreasona- 
ble Usage; which, when they pre- 
vailed so far, as to procure some 
Release for the Sick, were remark- 
ably followed with an Abatement 
of the Disease. The Plague in the 
Year 1636 began with great Vi- 
olence, but Leave being given by 
the King's Authority for People 
to quit their Houses; it was ob- 
served, That not one in twenty of 
the well Persons removed fell Sick, 
nor one in ten of the Sick dyed[/14./]. Which single Instance alone, had 
there been no other, should have 
been of Weight ever after to deter- 
mine the Magistracy against too 
strict Confinements. But besides 
this, a preceding Plague, viz. in the 
Year 1625, affords us another In- 
stance of a very remarkable De- 
crease upon the discontinuing to 
|P_37
shut up Houses. It was indeed so 
late in the Year, before this was 
done, that the near Approach of 
Winter was doubtless one Reason 
for the Diminution of the Disease, 
which followed: Yet this was so 
very great, that it is at least past 
dispute, that the Liberty then per- 
mitted was no Impediment to it: 
For this opening of the Houses was 
allowed of in the beginning of  Sep- 
tember; and whereas the last Week 
in August, there dyed no less than 
4218, the very next Week the 
Burials were diminuished to 3344, 
and in no longer time than to the 
fourth Week after, to 852 [/15./]. 

Since therefore the Management 
in former Times neither answers 
the Purpose of discovering the Be- 
ginning of the Infection, nor of put- 

|P_38
ting a stop to it when Discovered, 
other Measures are certainly to be 
taken; which I think should be of 
this Nature. 

Instead of ignorant old Women, 
who are generally appointed  Search- 
ers in Parishes to enquire what Dis- 
eases People dye of, That Office
should be committed to  Under- 
standing and Diligent Men, whose 
Business it should be, as soon as 
they find any have dyed after an 
uncommon Manner, particularly 
with livid Spots, Buboes, or  Car- 
buncles, to give Notice thereof to 
the Magistrates; who should im- 
mediately send skilful Physicians to 
Visit the Houses in the Neighbour- 
hood, especially of the Poorer sort, 
among whom this Evil generally 
begins; and if upon their Report 
it appears, that a Pestilential Di- 
stemper is broke out among the In- 
|P_39
habitants, They should without 
Delay order all the Families, in 
which the Sickness is, to be  Re- 
moved; The Sick to different Pla- 
ces from the Sound; but the Houses 
for both should be three or four 
Miles out of Town; and the Sound
People should be stript of all their 
Cloaths, and washed and shaved, 
before they go into their new Lodg- 
ings. 

No Manner of Compassion and 
Care should be wanting to the  Dis- 
eased; to whom, being now in clean
and airy Habitations, there would, 
with due Cautions, be no great 
Danger in giving Attendance. All 
Expences should be paid by the 
Publick, and no Charges ought to 
be thought great, which are coun- 
terbalanced with the saving a Nati- 
on from the greatest of Calamities. 
Nor does it seem to me at all un- 
|P_40
reasonable, that a Reward should 
be given to the Person, that makes 
the first Discovery of Infection in 
any Place; since it is undeniable, 
that the making known the Evil
to those, who are provided with 
proper Methods against it, is the 
first and main Step towards the o- 
vercoming it. 

When the Sick Families are gone, 
all the Goods of the Houses, in 
which they were, should be burnt; 
nay the Houses themselves; if that 
can conveniently be done. And 
after this all possible Care ought 
still to be taken to remove whatever 
Causes are found to breed and pro- 
mote Contagion. In order to this, 
the Overseers of the Poor (who 
might be assisted herein by other 
Officers) should visit the Dwellings 
of all the meaner sort of the Inha- 
bitants, and where they find 
|P_41
them stifled up too close and nasty, 
should lessen their Number by send- 
ing some into better Lodgings, 
and should take Care, by all Man- 
ner of Provision and Encourage- 
ment, to make them more cleanly
and sweet. 

No good Work carries its own 
Reward with it so much as this 
kind of Charity; and therefore be 
the Expence what it will, it must 
never be thought unreasonable. For 
nothing approaches so near to the 
first Original of Contagion, as Air 
pent up, loaded with Damps, and 
corrupted with the Filthiness, that 
proceeds from Animal Bodies. 

Our common Prisons afford us 
an Instance of this, in which very 
few escape, what they call the 
Goal Fever, which is always at- 
tended with a Degree of Maligni- 
|P_42
ty in proportion to the Closeness and 
Stench of the Place: And it would 
certainly very well become the Wis- 
dom of the Government, as well 
with Regard to the Health of the 
Town, as in Compassion to the  Pri- 
soners, to take Care, that all Houses 
of Confinement should be kept as 
Airy and Clean, as is consistent 
with the Use, to which they are 
designed. 

TheBlack Assize at Oxford, 
held in the Castle there in the 
Year 1577, will never be forgot [/16./]; 
at which the Judges, Gentry, and 
almost all that were present, to the 
Number of 300, were killed by a 
poysonous Steam, thought by some 
to have broke forth from the Earth; 
but by a noble and great Philosopher [/17./]
|P_43
more justly supposed to have been 
brought by the Prisoners out of the 
Goal into Court; it being observed, 
that they alone were not injured 
by it. 

At the same time, that this 
Care is taken of Houses, the pro- 
per Officers should be strictly charg- 
ed to see that the Streets be washed 
and kept clean from Filth, Carrion, 
and all Manner of Nusances; which 
should be carried away in the Night 
Time; nor should the Laystalls be 
suffered to be too near the City. 
Beggars and Idle Persons should be 
taken up, and such miserable Ob- 
jects, as are neither fit for the 
common Hospitals, nor Work-houses, 
should be provided for in an  Hos- 
pital of Incurables. 

Orders indeed of this kind are 
necessary to be observed at all times, 
|P_44
especially in populous Cities; and 
therefore I am sorry to take No- 
tice, that in these of London and 
Westminster there is no good  Po- 
lice established in these Respects; 
for want of which the Citizens and 
Gentry are every Day annoyed 
more ways than one. 

If these early Precautions, we have 
mentioned, take Effect, there 
will be no need of any Methods 
for Correcting the Air, Purifying 
Houses, or of Rules for preserving 
particular Persons from Infection: To 
all which, if the Plague get head, 
so that the Sick are too many to be 
removed, Regard must be had. 

As to the first; Fire has been al- 
most universally recommended for 
this Purpose, both by the Anci- 
ents and Moderns; who have ad- 
vised to make frequent and nume- 
|P_45
rous Fires in the Towns infected: 
By which Means, it is said,  Hip- 
pocrates preserved Greece from a 
Plague, which was entring into it 
from Aethiopia[/18./]. And it is cer- 
tain, that some evil Dispositions of 
the Air, particularly such as pro- 
ceed from Damps, Exhalations, 
&c. may be corrected by Fire, 
and the Predisposition of it to 
receive Infection from these Causes 
sometimes removed. But when the 
Distemper is actually begun, and 
rages, since it is known to be 
spread and increased by the Heat
of the Summer, and on the con- 
trary checked by the cold in  Win- 
ter; undoubtedly, whatever increases 
that Heat will so far add Force to 
the Disease. Whether the Service 
Fires may do by correcting any 
other ill Qualities of the Air will 
|P_46
counterbalance the Inconvenience 
upon this Account, Experience on- 
ly can determine; and the Fatal 
success of the Tryals made here 
in the last Plague, is more than 
sufficient to discourage any further 
Attempts of this Nature; for Fires
being ordered in all the Streets for 
three Days together, there dyed 
in one Night following no less than 
4000; whereas in any single Week 
before or after, not much above 
three times that Number were car- 
ryed off [/19./]. 

What has been said of Fires, is 
likewise to be understood of firing 
of Guns, which some have too rash- 
ly advised. The proper Correcti- 
on of the Air would be to make it 
fresh and cool. Accordingly the 
|P_47
Arabians[/20./], who were best acquaint- 
ed with the Nature of Pestilences, 
advise People to keep themselves 
as airy as possible, and to chuse 
Dwellings exposed to the Wind. 

For keeping Houses cool, they 
took to be the best Method of 
purifying them; and therefore to 
answer this End more fully, they 
directed to strew them with cooling
Herbs, as Roses, Violets,  Water- 
Lillies, &c. and to be washed with 
Water and Vinegar; than all which, 
especially the last, nothing more 
proper can be proposed: Though 
it be directly contrary to what Mo- 
dern Authors mostly advise, which 
is to make Fumes with hot Things, 
as Benzoin, Frankincense, Asa Foe- 
tida, Storax, &c. from which I 
see no reason to expect any Virtue 
|P_48
to destroy the Matter of Infection, 
or to keep particular Places from a 
Disposition to receive it; which are 
the only things here to be aimed 
at. It is of more Consequence to 
be observed, that as Nastiness is a 
great Source of Infection, so  Clean- 
liness is the greatest Preservative: 
Which is the true Reason, why the 
Poor are most obnoxious to Dis- 
asters of this Kind. 

The next thing after the purifying 
of Houses, is to consider by what 
Means particular Persons may best 
defend themselves against  Contagi- 
on; for the effectual doing of which 
it would be necessary to put the 
Humours of the Body into such a 
State, as not to be alterable by the 
Matter of Infection. But since this 
is no more to be hoped for, than 
a Specific Preservative from the 
Small-Pox; the most that can be 
|P_49
done, will be to keep the Body in 
such Order, that it may suffer as 
little as possible. The first Step to- 
wards which, is to maintain a good 
State of Health, in which we are 
always least liable to suffer by any 
external Injuries; and not to weaken 
the Body by Evacuations. The 
next is, to guard against all  Dejecti- 
on of Spirits, and immoderate Pas- 
sions; for these we daily observe do 
expose Persons to the more com- 
mon Contagion of the Small-Pox. 
These Ends will be best answered 
by living with Temperance upon a 
good generous Diet, and avoiding 
Fastings, Watchings, extreme Weari- 
ness, &c. Another Defence is, to 
use whatever Means are proper to 
keep the Blood from Inflaming. 
This, if it does not secure from 
contracting Infection, will at least 
make the Effects of it less violent. 
|P_50
The most proper Means for this, 
according to the Advice of the 
Arabian Physicians, is the repeat- 
ed Use of acid Fruits, as  Pomegra- 
nates, Sevil Oranges, Lemons, tart 
Apples, &c. But above all of  Wine- 
Vinegar in small Quantities, ren- 
dered grateful to the Stomach by 
the Infusion of some such Ingre- 
dients as Gentian Root, Galangal, 
Zedoary, Juniper Berries, &c. Which 
Medicines by correcting the  Vine- 
gar, and taking off some ill Effects 
it might otherwise have upon the 
Stomach, will be of good Use: 
But these, and all other hot  Aro- 
matic Drugs, though much recom- 
mended by Authors, if used alone, 
are most likely to do hurt by over 
heating the Blood. 

But since none of these Methods 
promise any certain Protection; as 
|P_51
leaving the Place infected is the 
surest Preservative, so the next to 
it, is to avoid, as much as may be, 
the near Approach to the Sick, or 
to such as have but lately Recover- 
ed. For the greater Security here- 
in, it will be advisable to avoid all 
Crouds of People. Nay it should 
be the Care of the Magistrate to 
prohibit all unnecessary Assemblies; 
and likewise to oblige all, who get 
over the Disease, to Confine them- 
selves for some time, before they 
appear abroad. 

The Advice to keep at a Di- 
stance from the Sick, is also to be 
understood of the Dead Bodies:
which should be buried at as great 
a Distance from Dwelling Houses, 
as may be; put deep in the Earth; 
and covered with the exactest Care. 
They should likewise be carried out
|P_52
in the Night, while they are yet 
fresh and free from Putrefaction: 
Because a Carcass not yet begin- 
ning to Corrupt, if kept from the 
Heat of the Day, hardly emits any 
kind of Steam or Vapour. 

As for those, who must of ne- 
cessity attend the Sick; some fur- 
ther Directions should be added for 
their Use. These may be com- 
prehended in two short Precepts. 
One is, not to swallow their Spittle
while they are about the Sick, but 
rather to spit it out: The other, not 
so much as to draw in their Breath, 
when they are very near them. 
The reason for both these appears 
from what has been said above con- 
cerning the Manner, in which a 
sound Person receives the Infecti- 
on. 

|P_53
This is the Sum of what I think 
most likely to stop the Progress of 
the Disease in any Place, where it 
shall have got Admittance. If some 
few of these Rules refer more par- 
ticularly to the City of London, 
with small Alteration they may be 
applied to any other Place. It 
now remains therefore only to lay 
down some Directions to hinder 
the Distemper's spreading from Town
to Town. The best Method for 
which, where it can be done, is 
to cast up a Line about the Town 
insected, at a convenient Distance; 
and by placing a Guard, to hin- 
der People's passing from it with- 
out due Regulation, to other 
Towns: But not absolutely to for- 
bid any to withdraw themselves, as 
they have now done in France, ac- 
cording to the usual Practice abroad; 
|P_54
which is an unnecessary Severity, 
not to call it a Cruelty. I think it 
will be enough, if all, who desire 
to pass the Line, be permitted to do 
it, upon Condition they first per- 
form Quarentine for about 20 Days 
in Tents, or other more conveni- 
ent Habitations. But the greatest 
Care must be taken, that none 
pass without conforming themselves 
to this Order, both by keeping di- 
ligent Watch, and by punishing
with the utmost Severity, any that 
shall either have done so, or at- 
tempt it. And the better to disco- 
ver such, it will be requisite to o- 
blige all, who travel in any Part 
of the Country, under the same 
Penalties, to carry with them  Cer- 
tificates either of their coming from 
Places not Infected, or of their pas- 
sing the Line by permission. 

|P_55
This I take to be a more effectu- 
al Method to keep the Infection
from spreading, than the absolute 
refusing a Passage to People upon 
any Terms. For when Men are 
in such imminent Danger of their 
Lives, where they are; many, no 
doubt, if not otherwise allowed to 
escape, will use Endeavours to do 
it secretly, let the Hazard be ever 
so great. And it can hardly be, 
but some will succeed in their At- 
tempts; as we see fell out in France
notwithstanding all their Care. But 
one that gets off thus clandestine- 
ly, will be more like to carry the 
Distemper with him, than twenty, 
nay a hundred, that go away un- 
der the preceding Restrictions: E- 
specially because the Infection of 
the Place, he flies from, will by 
this Management be rendered much 
|P_56
more intense. For confining Peo- 
ple, and shutting them up together 
in great Numbers, will make the 
Distemper rage with augmented 
Force, even to the increasing it be- 
yond what can be easily imagin- 
ed; As appears from the Account, 
which the learned Gassendus[/21./] has 
given us of a memorable Plague, 
which happened at Digne in  Pro- 
vence, where he lived, in the Year 
1619. This was so terrible, that 
in one Summer out of ten thousand
Inhabitants, it left but fifteen hun- 
dred, and of them all but five or 
six had gone through the Disease. 
And he assigns this, as the princi- 
pal Cause of the great Destruction, 
That the Citizens were too closely 
confined, and not suffered so much 
as to go to their Country Houses. 
|P_57
Whereas in another Pestilence, which 
broke out in the same Place a year 
and half after, more Liberty being 
allowed, there did not dye above 
one hundred Persons. 

For these Reasons, I think, to 
allow People with proper Cautions
to remove from an infected Place, 
is the best Means to suppress the 
Contagion, as well as the most 
humane Treatment of the present 
Sufferers: But though Liberty ought 
to be given to the People, yet no 
sort of Goods must by any means be 
suffered to be carried over the 
Line, which are made of  Mate- 
rials retentive of Infection. For 
in the present Case, when  In- 
fection has seized any Part of a 
Country, much greater Care ought 
to be taken, that no Seeds of the 
Contagion be conveyed about, than 
|P_58
when the Distemper is at a great 
Distance; because a Bale of Goods, 
which shall have imbibed the  Con- 
tagious Aura when packt up in 
Turkey, or any remote Parts; yet, 
when unpackt here, may chance 
to meet with so healthful a Tempe- 
rament of our Air, that it shall 
not do much hurt. But when 
the Air of any one of our Towns 
shall be so corrupted, as to spread 
and maintain the Pestilence in it, 
there will be little reason to believe, 
that the Air of the rest of the 
Country is in a much better State. 

For the same Reason  Quaren- 
tines should more strictly be en- 
joined, when the Plague is in a 
bordering Kingdom, than when it 
is more remote. 

|P_59
I have gone through the chief 
Branches of Preservation against 
the Plague. And shall only add, 
that if the Burning of Goods, which 
has been proposed, be thought a- 
ny Way offensive or inconvenient, 
The Burying of them six Feet, or 
more, under Ground may answer 
the Purpose as well. 

What has been said of the  Na- 
ture of Contagion, upon which the 
foregoing Directions are grounded, 
may also be of Use towards e- 
stablishing a better Method of 
Cure, than Authors have common- 
ly taught: But to engage in this 
is beyond the present Design. 

FINIS.
