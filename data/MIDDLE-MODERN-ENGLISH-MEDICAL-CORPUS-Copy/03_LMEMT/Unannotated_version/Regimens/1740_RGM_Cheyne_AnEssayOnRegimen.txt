§. 1. THERE is not a more pernicious 
Error in Physic, or one more 
opposit to the Expectation of 
Patients, (viz. the Preservation or Recovery 
of their Health) than that very common and 
universally received Opinion, That there are 
Bodies in Nature, or in the Materia Medica, o
r such as may be found out by Art, by 
dividing, compounding, or altering them by 
the Tortures of the Fire, which will sudden-
|P_ii
ly, or in any great Degree, change or destroy the 
Malignity of the morbid Humors of animal 
Bodies; or will intirely alter the Nature, 
Qualities, Figure, Size and Laws of Cohesion
of the Particles that compose their Fluids
and Solids; from an unsound and unhealthy 
State, to one of a kindly and benign Nature (a 
wild Notion, at first introduc'd and propagated 
by enthusiastical Chymists, Quacks and Sym-
ptom-Doctors). An animal Body is nothing but 
a Compages or Contexture of Pipes, an hydraulic 
Machin, fill'd with a Liquor of such a Nature as 
was transfus'd into it by its Parents, or is 
changed into by the Nature of the Food it is 
nourish'd with, and is ever afterwards good, 
bad, or indifferent, as these two Sources have 
sent it forth. The Primae Viae, or the ali-
mentary Tube, is, as it were, a Common Sewer,
may be foul'd or clean'd in various Manners, 
and with great Facility; it is wide, open, and 
reasonably strong, in most Animals: But from 
the Intestines into the Habit, (which only 
ought to be reckon'd the Body, or the Vehicle
of the Soul) and into the sanguiferous Tubes,
into the Glands and Bowels, the Passages from 
thence are so streight and narrow, that they are 
but infinitesimal Pores, rather than Orifices, 
Strainers and Searches, rather than Mouths
of Tubes, and are scarce ever visible or perceptible 
in a healthy State; and the Supply and Nutriture 
of the Fluids and Solids must pass under the 
|P_iii
Form of a Steam or Vapour through them, 
and not in the Form of a Liquor, either for 
Food or Physic, either to increase the Quan-
tity, or alter the Quality of the Blood and 
Juices; and the Solids (which concentred, 
consolidated and condens'd into their real or 
first Formation Size, would not equal a Grain of 
Sand) are permanent and dureable, and con-
tinue pretty much in that State of Elasticity
and Firmness, they were first created with; and 
they are strong or weak, small or coarse, firm
or lax, loose or elastic, blunt or sharp, as they 
were first made by the supreme Artificer, or are 
alter'd somewhat by the original Dyscrasy
or Distempers of the Parents, (the Mother
can only mend or spoil their Juices, which 
might be easily perfected by long Continuance 
in a sweetening Diet, during their younger 
Days; which if they survive, they generally 
grow stronger as they grow older, become 
the Genii, and the Governors of the World, 
because the Solids, thus purified, come from 
the Father alone) and continue much the 
same all the Time of their Duration on this 
Globe, except so far as the small temporary
and fugitive Alteration that Diet, Exercise,
or Evacuation, or mild ponderous Medicines 
long continued, may make on them; so small 
a Matter it really is, that Physic, or the Ma-
teria Medica, can perform on the Habit, on 
the Solids at least; and yet it is only in and 
by them, that Health, long Life and Sere-
nity are to be had: The most that Physic
|P_iv
or Physicians can do, is in and by the Primæ 
Vitæ, or alimentary Tube, through these fine 
lacteal Searches into the Habit.

§. 2. What is it then, will it be said, that 
Art, Physic or a philosophic Physician, can 
truly do, to relieve the Miseries, Pains and Dis-
eases of their Fellow-Creatures? A great deal, 
if judiciously and honestly directed, and obstinat-
ly and exactly pursued, viz. by mending the 
Juices in the Manner Nature, the Distemper, 
the Age, and the Habitudes of the Patient point 
out. These (the Juices) are the only things 
in an animal Body, in the Power and under the 
Dominion of a Physician. If the principal In-
tentions of the Physician be to mend the Blood 
and Juices, they will in time, and by the wise 
Mechanism of Nature, rectify and confirm the 
Solids into their proper Situation and Tone; for 
it is out of, and by the Juices, that the Solids
are nourish'd, figur'd and cloath'd. Air and Ex-
ercise will give them the proper Firmness and 
Degree of Elasticity, and then the animal 
Functions will be perform'd with Facility and 
Pleasure, and thereby the Person will enjoy 
Health and Serenity. Art can do nothing 
but remove Impediments, resolve Obstruc-
tions, cut off and tear away Excrescences and 
Superfluities, and reduce Nature to its primi-
tive Order; and this only can be done by 
a proper and specific Regimen in Quantity and 
Quality, by Air and Exercise, and by well-
judg'd and timeous Evacuation, and prepareing 
|P_v
the morbid Juices for easier Elimination, by 
Means which, I fear, lie in a narrow Compass, 
and depend mostly on the mild mineral Medi-
cins (which were never originally design'd by 
Nature to be introduc'd into an animal Body, 
and always rend, tear and wear them out faster, 
like Spirits and chymical Medicins, but in 
bad Cases are at first at least necessary) judici-
ously managed with proper Dilution.

§. 3. PHLEBOTOMY will directly let 
out a Part of the bad and vicious Juices, to 
be immediatly supplied with good ones, from 
proper Regimen, by making the Vessels more 
roomy, and thereby enabling the Circulation
to make her fuller Rounds; for when the 
Blood-Vessels are too turgid and full, or the 
Juices too thick, gross, and sizy, to tumify 
them, the natural Secretions and Discharges 
will be too small to admit into them new, 
fresh, sweet Juices, from Food or Physic, 
which well-tim'd, partial and frequent Phle-
botomy, will much assist. Vomits drive forci-
bly out of the upper Part of the chyliferous 
Tube, not only its noxious Contents, but 
strongly squeeze all the Glands (which are 
infinit) of the Abdomen, dissolve and fuse by 
its Convulsions, and internal Compressure, 
their Contents, (and that of the universal 
Mass of the Fluids) and promote their Ex-
pulsion; and, frequently repeated, are of 
more Use and Efficacy than all the other Evacua-
tions join'd together; for they not only truly 
|P_vi
reach the Habit, supply the Place of Exercise, 
cleanse the internal Viscera and Glands,
(which can by no other means be reached) 
but compress, squecze and drive out the most 
distant Obstructions, by setting the whole 
System, and the most remote Fibre, in violent 
Action and Play; and where the Solids and 
natural Strength will admit, are, I think, the 
most universal Remedy known to Art, if 
obstinatly and long persisted in, in chronical
and obstinat Cases especially; for most infal-
libly they bring out all the latent most remote 
Morbosities in the Habit, dissolve and fuse 
them, and mix them with the universal Mass 
of Fluids, in the Trunks of the great Ves-
sels, to be more readily and easily thrown out 
of the Habit: but they are a hard Work, and 
few can bear them. Purges clean and empty 
the lower Part of the chyliferous Tubes, leave 
the Glands situated there, more Freedom to 
part with their Obstructions by subsequent 
Repetitions: but this Evacuation, tho' much 
easier, yet is a great way about, and of slow 
and small Efficacy in great Diseases, unless the 
Malady be situated in the lowermost Regions 
of the Body; and even then Vomits do it 
sooner and more effectually: and in weak Ha-
bits, and nervous Distempers, Purges ruffle ex-
tremely. Diaphoretics, I think, do little in 
these our Northern Climats, unless they be 
very gentle, and are useful only in acute Cases,
where Nature tends towards a Crise; in chro-
nical Cases, they heat and inflame, and only 
|P_vii
spend the thinnest and most aqueous Parts of 
the Fluids, which are generally most innocent. 
Diuretics scour and clean the urinaryPas-
sages, and carry off scorbutic and nephritic 
Salts: but to be innocent or efficacious, they 
ought to consist of the thinnest, softest and 
coolest of all Liquors, that is, the purest Water, 
just soften'd and acuated by the Meal or Salt of 
some proper Vegetable. Blisters are mostly 
Topical, they melt, fuse, and draw forth 
the viscid Serum from the capillary Vessels, and 
leave Room for a freer Circulation; and 
when promoted and effected by Cantharides,
have a sensible Effect on the most distant Fluids 
and Solids; and in acute Cases, they are indeed 
the greatest and most effectual Remedy. These 
are most and chiefest of the Evacuations used 
in the Practice of Physic, and, judiciously and 
properly pursued, are of the greatest Conse-
quence to lay a solid Foundation for a Cure.

§. 4. MERCURY and Antimony alone, 
with their milder Preparations, judiciously ma-
naged, and united with the specific Juice of Ve-
getables that Experience has determin'd pro-
per for the Distemper, upon all the Reasoning 
and Experience I have ever had, bids fairest 
for attenuating the Juices, and opening the 
Obstructions in the small Vessels and Glands,
and so fitting the morbid Particles for Elimi-
nation; but they are a two-edged Sword, and 
destroy weak Persons in unskilful Hands; but 
I have Occasion to speak more explicitly of 
|P_viii
their Nature and Effects in another Place. Nitre
and its Preparations, especially the animalPre-
paration of it, in Wood-lice, has been thought 
by all Antiquity, the most innocent and yet 
most effectual of all the saline Tribe of Me-
dicins, to cool, deterge, and open Obstruc-
tions; and its sensible Effect in dividing the 
Blood-Globules in the Lungs, and giving it 
thereby its Scarlet Colour, and its Efficacy in 
propagating and quickening Fire and Light, (in 
both which Effects it has undoubtedly a great 
Power, if not the greatest) shew its Energy; 
and in febrile Exacerbations, especially of the 
Symptomatic kind from malignant Ulcers, and 
an inflammatory State of the Blood, when plen-
tifully diluted with pure Water, and long con-
tinued, I think, and have found it the best, 
if not the only Remedy, sufficient to justify the 
great Encomium on the Natron of the Antients. 
When the Blood is sufficiently fus'd, and the 
Glands made sufficiently open and pervious, by 
Evacuation and Diet, then Steel, Bark and 
Bitters, judiciously prepared, and fitted to the 
original Strength of the Solids of the Patients, 
will be found the most effectual, to wind up 
the Springs of Life, and to give a Tension, due 
Tone, and proper Degree of Elasticity to the So-
lids, the Fibres and Nerves, but especially the 
Membranes, which, I think, are the true and 
only Seats of Spring and Elasticity, and the pro-
per immediat Instruments of Motion and the 
Functions in an animal Machin: Long and 
great Evacuation, and a thin cool Diet, while 
|P_ix
they are pursued to fuse, thin, and attenuat the 
Juices, must of Necessity relax and let down 
the Spring of all the Solids; when the Juices 
are sufficiently thin'd and attenuated, (which 
Blood-letting will always discover) then, to give 
Strength, Vigour and Activity to the Patient, that 
all the Secretions may be duely made; the sole 
Intention to perfect the Cure, I say, is to wind 
up the Solids again, as far as Art can, which, I 
fear, is not far; at least, I have never found it 
much, nor very dureable; for all Astringents are 
of the Nature, act by the same Laws, and have 
the Effect that Wine and spirituous Liquors
have, and are not unlike the buckling upon 
Pipes and boiling soft broken Hair; they will 
give them a new Tension and proper Figure 
for a short time, but their Efficacy and Re-
lief is only fugitive and transient, and never 
dureable; and they effect at the same time a 
thickening, incrassating and sizeing on the 
Blood and Juices, while they are winding up, 
braceing and contracting the Solids; for the 
Effects of the Qualities and Powers of all Bodies, 
both Liquids and Solids, of Food and Physic,
are always in a duplicat Proportion of the 
Distance from the Centre of their component 
Particles. There is indeed this Difference 
between Bark, Bitters and Steel, and that of 
strong Liquors, that the Sides of the Vessels, 
especially their fine close membranous Coats, 
imbibe, attract and preserve the astringent
Virtue and Qualities of Bark, Bitters and 
Steel, and such Astringents and Bracers, longer, 
|P_x
by reason of their innate attractive Virtue on 
the Particles of such Bodies, their greater Soli-
dity, and closer Texture, than the Blood Glo-
bules and the circulating Fluids do, which are in a 
perpetual Flux; and spirituous Liquors mixing 
more immediatly, fully, and by closer and larger 
Contacts with the circulating Juices, spend their 
Efficacy on them, and thicken them faster. For 
these Causes and Reasons, I say, strong Liquors 
must have a more immediat and stronger Effect 
on the Blood and Juices, for condensing and 
thickening them, than Steel, Bitters and 
Bark, and such-like Astringents can have; and 
so spirituous Liquors much indulged, must 
necessarily have a much quicker, and more 
deleterious Effect on animal Fluids, than Steel
and Astringents can: but still they both act 
in one Tenor, and by one general Law; and 
Steel, Bitters and Astringents, improperly and 
intemperatly us'd, and over-dos'd, will have 
the same kind of bad Effects, and produce the 
same Symptoms and Diseases that Intempe-
rance in strong Liquors will; only they are 
sooner felt, are less grateful and bewitch-
ing, are much less or not at all craved, and con-
sequently are sooner given over. 

§. 5. It is Diet alone, proper and specific 
Diet, in Quantity, Quality and Order,con-
tinued in till the Juices are sufficiently thinn'd, 
to make the Functions regular and easy, which 
is the sole universal Remedy, and the only 
Mean known to Art, or that an animal Ma-
|P_xi
chin, without being otherwise made than it 
is, can use with certain Benefit and Success, 
which can give Health, long Life and Sere-
nity. There is an innate Degree of Strength 
and Elasticity in the Solids, to circulat the 
Liquors, and promote the Secretions, and 
carry on the vital Functions, with which one 
comes into the World, which they derive 
from their Birth and Parents, which is ever 
after but little alter'd even either by Art or Diet: 
Growth, Inlargement of the Body, and crusting 
over the original Solids, and Maturation, only 
fills the linear and infinitesimal original Tubes
and Vessels with a proper Liquor, to stretch, 
extend, and plump them, as a Sack is fill'd 
with Grain, or a Bladder with Air or Water; 
from that Liquor, their Coats, the fleshy and 
nervous Fibres of the Muscles, Tendons and 
Membrans, and other Solids of the Body, is 
thicken'd, crusted over, and condens'd; the 
Spring, Elasticity, and motive Power, lies 
solely and intirely in the original, primary, 
divinely organis'd linear Fibrils, and the Mem-
brans made of them. The Incrustration and 
Incrassation from the Fluids, in the Tubes
superinduced on them, but weakens their ori-
ginalSpring and Elasticity, both by its Weight 
and incommensurat Vibrations, as we find by 
the Elasticity of Twigs, the sharp Notes of 
fine small Hairs, and the Agility of young 
Animals. The Elasticity consists mainly in 
the original Degree of Attraction in the com-
|P_xii
ponentelementary Particles of the linear Fi-
brils, primarily fashion'd by the Author of 
Nature; and it is in this Elasticity alone, 
the Force, Power and Pleasure of Life, and of 
the animal Functions, consists. If the Elasti-
city of these Solids be such, as easily, readily 
and pleasantly to overcome and slide over all 
the Rubs, Impediments and Letts in the 
Functions, (whatever State the Fluids be in) 
then the Animal is healthy, active and gay; 
otherwise, if they are perform'd with Labour 
and Struggle, and from too great Efforts of the 
self-motive Principle on the primarily divinely 
organis'd Vehicles, and its Load of Crust which 
is laid on it, to defend it from the Injuries of 
this Element, and ruinous Planet we are now 
confin'd to: For as a Surgeon lays a Plaister on a 
Sore, to defend it from the Air, and the Touch
of hard rough Bodies; if this Plaisterit-
self should be hard, rough, corrosive, or sti-
mulating, it would become a Pain and Incom-
modity, instead of a Pleasure or Defence. It 
is out of the Juices that circulat in the Tubes,
that this plaistering is made on the primitive
sensible elastic Fibrils; and it is therefore of 
the last Consequence, and indeed the One
thing necessary, that these Juices be the sweet-
est, lightest and most lenient possible; and this 
we can only bring about by Diet, soft, sweet, 
cool, mild Diet.

|P_xiii
§. 6. Some Persons have industriously and 
designedly spread it about, that I was of Opi-
nion, that a sole strict Vegetable; or Milk and 
Seed Diet, was the best and fittest for all Per-
sons, Climats, and Ages, without Exception or 
Limitation, and the only one proper, approv'd 
by the Author of Nature, and specific to cure 
all animal Distempers; advised my Patients no 
other, or pretended to cure them no other way, 
be their Distemper what it will. My Opinions 
are of little Consequence to the World, and I 
hope I have too little Value or Regard for them, 
as they are mine, to be any Degree sanguin
or concern'd for their Reception. I have, and 
I hope have always express'd, so great a Re-
gard for the Wisdom, Fitness, and Propriety of 
Things, as discover'd by Revelation, (from 
whence the Patent for animal Food is deriv'd) 
not to set up my Opinions or Ideas in Oppo-
sition to those of holy Writ, and the Divine 
Spirit speaking in it. The Wisdom of Man,
even that of the highest Cherubim, is but Fool-
ishness, when compared with the Omniscience
of God, and his wise Providence. He that 
made us and sent us here, knows best what is 
fittest for us, to answer and bring about his 
own Designs of Love and Mercy. But I am 
thoroughly convinced, from Reason, Experi-
ence, Philosophy and Revelation, that in our 
present State, in this our probatory transitory 
Situation, on this ruinous Globe, (sensibly and 
|P_xiv
evidently spoil'd a second time by the Deluge) 
on which we are now situated, that animal 
Food, their Juices, and integral Particles, are 
the fittest and most proper, to produce most 
quickly and more immediatly, the firmest 
hardest human Flesh, and warmest strongest 
Blood. There is a Similarity and Homoge-
neity between the muscular Flesh of tender 
sweet Animals, and that of the human Body; 
the integral Particles of the Solids of the 
first, and the component Globules of their 
Juices, are ready form'd, figur'd and adjusted 
to build up the Flesh, and cloath the Solids, and 
furnish out the Juices of the latter: they are 
at hand, adjusted by Square and Compass,
directly to be laid together, to rear the So-
lids; and their Juices are inur'd and fami-
liaris'd to perform the Meanders of the Circu-
lation, and with Facility to perform all the ani-
mal Functions, with the least Labour or Struggle, 
less than those of Vegetables in general; as a 
Mason will sooner and more strongly build the 
Walls of a House, who has hewn plain rect-
angular Stones at hand, than one who has 
rough Stones only, Sand and Mortar, all 
which must be first figur'd or prepar'd for a 
solid dureable Building. All this, I think, is 
true, just and philosophical; and while Youth 
and tolerable Health continues, none ought 
to alter the common temperat Diet of the 
middling Rank of those among whom he 
lives, for a particular or artificial one, without 
|P_xv
a particular Call, and the best Advice: Nay, 
I think such a Change unnatural, out of the 
Order of Providence, and in some Degree 
immoral. When a Person is tolerably well, and 
not far advanced into Life, to change an ani-
mal for a vegetable Diet, to avoid mere Pos-
sibilities and future Contingencies, is arrogant-
ly prying into the divine Decrees, and inso-
lentlycriticising the Conduct of his Provi-
dence. If God's Design is to purify us by Pains 
and Penalties here, ours ought not to be only 
the mere enjoying the Kingdoms of this World,
and the Glories thereof. If his be to shorten the 
Time of our Sufferings, by rendering them 
more intense; ours ought to be to bear them 
as long as by his Assistance we possibly can, in 
the common Course of Nature and Provi-
dence; for if we cowardly fly from them on 
one Side, He has Power and Skill enough 
to double them in another; in this Particular, 
whatever is, is best: But if we should find 
our Pains and Sufferings so intense, that they 
are no longer tolerable, but hinder, instead of 
promoting, what is our Duty and Vocation,
and what we are convinced is best for us, then 
he has advised us, when persecuted in one 
City, to flee to another: Then, and only then, 
when animal Food will no longer do, we are 
to try what Milk and Seeds can do to ease our 
Pain. It is only the Cross of God's Appoint-
ment, and which he declares his, by natural 
Causes, and in the Course of his Providence, 
|P_xvi
unforeseen and unavoidable, which we are to 
take up daily, and with all the Joy, Alacrity 
and Resignation, that the Meaning of a Cross
can imply, that is, the best we can, with the Aid 
of his Grace. And if Suffering, Punishment, 
Pains and Penalties, and shortening the Dura-
tion of our Imprisonment here, be the very 
best for us in our present Situation and State; 
and if animal Food, and fermented Liquors, 
naturally, necessarily, and mechanicallypro-
duce these Effects more readily than Vege-
tables, Milk and Seed Foods, and aqueous Li-
quors, then was it with infinit Wisdom, Kind-
ness and Fitness, that the Holy Spirit permitted 
animal Food, and inlarged the Materials of our 
Aliment, even tho' his first Intention for Man 
had been Vegetables only (which could only be 
in a paradisaical State, or on a better unspoil'd 
Planet). But the real Truth is, Nature, our 
Globe, the various unkindly Climats, the diffe-
rent Ages, States, Conditions and Circum-
stances under which Man is at present, render it 
utterly impossible and impracticable, that Man 
should be advis'd, order'd or commanded, by in-
finit Wisdom, to live only on Vegetables. It is 
not, and it cannot be, by Bread alone that Man 
can live at present; it cannot answer the Ends, 
Uses and Occasions Men are now necessitated 
to pursue. Great and sudden Efforts of Prow-
ess and Strength cannot be answer'd or exe-
cuted by Vegetables and Water only; they are 
too thin, weak and poor. Youth-hood, Vigour, 
|P_xvii
Robustness, and great Action, would be tor-
tur'd, and languish under Bread and Water 
in ever so great Plenty: Milk, Fruits, Seeds
and Vegetables, in any Perfection, are of much 
greater Expence and Labour to procure, than 
that the Poor and Necessitous now can afford 
them, especially in Northern Climats; they 
have lost their Vigour, Energy and Balsam, 
since the Deluge. Milk is appropriated for 
Children, and not grown Men, to answer the 
Ends of Providence. But to explain my 
Thoughts on this Matter as a Physician only,
 as clearly and precisely as I can, as they flow 
from natural Philosophy, the animal Oeco-
nomy, and my own Experience, I say, 1. That 
after a Fever, or any acute Distemper is over, 
and had its perfect Crise, and the Person is not 
past the Meridian of Life, the Blood and 
Juices, by the strong and violent Labour of the 
Solids, being sufficiently ground, effete and 
languid, a Milk, Seed, or vegetable Diet, is 
by no means long and obstinatly to be con-
tinued in; it would continue the Party too 
languid, the Juices too thin and vapid, and 
the Spirits too low; and therefore he ought 
absolutely to be directed to an animal Diet, 
and temperatly strong Liquors of the lightest, 
most nourishing and balsamic Nature, to be 
gradually and cautiously enter'd upon; especi-
ally as he begins to be capable of Air and 
Exercise. 2. If upon takeing away a few 
Ounces of Blood only out of a large Orifice, the 
Curd is found too thin, tender, watery, and 
|P_xviii
too readily fusible, or dissolvible in warm 
Water, and the Serum too clear, whiteish, or 
in too great a Quantity; a Milk, Seed and 
vegetable Diet, is by no means to be longer 
continued in, but is to be altered gradually 
into light, sweet and young animal Food, and 
temperat fermented Liquors. 3. If after two, 
three, four or five Years, the Disorders for 
which a low cool Diet was advis'd and enter'd 
upon, with sufficient Strictness and Precision, 
is not cured, or greatly reliev'd, the Party may 
conclude, that a low cool Diet will not make 
a perfect Cure, and must with Patience, and a 
general Regularity, enter on common Life, 
and not be longer scrupulous, or anxious 
about Regimen, in the Quality, but in the 
Quantity, and submit to the Order of Provi-
dence, and use the Means that Experience or 
the best Advice suggests to alleviat the Sym-
ptoms, and do the best he can taliter qualiter,
if he is under Fifty. 4. To such as have an 
original hereditary weakly scorbutical or scro-
phulous Habit, and are far advanced in Life; 
who have mesenteric glandular Obstructions, 
with feeble Solids, and little Strength and 
Vigour, a Milk, Seed and vegetable Diet, with 
aqueous Liquors, is by no means to be advis'd; 
for as the Case is absolutely incureable, it were 
in vain to torment and restrain them, more 
cruelly than their Distemper itself does; they 
must not be forbid, but rather indulged the 
common Comforts and Gratifications of Life. 
It is to such that St. Paul's Advice to Timothy
|P_xix
is just, as well as kind, to drink a little Wine 
for their Stomachs sake, and their often In-
firmities: A general Moderation, and an Ob-
servation of the Juvantia and Lædentia, is 
only to be advised, and the Use of these Means 
known to Art, to alleviat Symptoms. 5. In 
all eruptive Cases, in all acute and periodical
cutaneous Cases, in the actual Fits of the Gout,
in the second Fever of the Small-Pox, in 
Fevers verging towards a Crise, to drive out 
from the Centre to the Circumference any 
changeable Disorder, and universally in all 
Cases where the vital Indications languish 
and labour, and Nature is in a Struggle 
to throw outward Morbosity; she is most cer-
tainly to be assisted by generous cordial and 
warmer Medicins, and higher Diet, to further 
the End Nature points at. These are some of the 
Cases where too low and cool a Regimen is by 
no means to be advised or pursued. 6. And 
lastly, Whenever the End of a low Diet is 
obtained, viz. the sweetning and thinning the 
Juices, and the Symptoms are abated or cured, 
the Diet is to be heighten'd, and gradually 
and cautiously rais'd, at least if the Party be 
under Fifty. I will now suggest as plainly, in 
what Cases I think it is to be advised and tried. 
As to the Healthy and Well, I have nothing here 
to say: Sufficient for the Day is the Evil 
thereof.

§. 7. It is only to those whose Stomach
and Digestion is so weak and relax'd, that they 
|P_xx
cannot concoct without extreme Suffering, any 
such Proportion even of tender animal Food 
and fermented Liquors, as may be sufficient to 
nourish and support them: To those whose 
Blood and Juices are evidently so thick, 
gross and viscid, that it fills and obstructs the 
Vessels so tumidly, that they cannot receive a 
sufficient Quantity of either Medicin or Food,
to cure or preserve them, the Circulation and 
Perspiration being intirely at a stand: To those
who are subject to perpetual Hæmorrhages,
Inflammations, or constant small acute Fe-
vers: To those who are after the great Meal 
towards Midnight, hectical or consumptive:
To those labouring under a scorbutico-nervose 
Atrophy and wasting: To those labouring 
under hereditary, early, knotted, disabling and 
painful Gouts or Stone: To those who are 
highly, hereditarily and early scrophulous or 
scorbutical: To those who are leprous and 
universally crusted over with cutaneous 
Blotches and Scabs: To those who are epi-
leptical early in Life, with a thin cacochymic
Habit: To those who are constantly hysterical
or hypocondriacal, with frequent Fits and Con-
vulsions, under a weak thin Habit, which 
threaten a Consumption; for I have always 
observed these obstinat violent hysteric and 
hypocondriac Fits in young slender Persons, to 
be the first Stage of a real Phthisis Pulmonum,
or at least of a nervous Atrophy; and if it 
was not cured or prevented in this its first 
|P_xxi
Stage, by the same Means and Regimen com-
monly the Refuge of the subsequent Stages, 
they were not to be ever after remedied, they 
being sure Presages of Tubercles in the Lungs: 
To those that are plainly cancerous; in short, 
to those chiefly who after they have long and 
strictly follow'd the best Advice, and the most 
effectual Remedies, still labour under some 
atrocious, painful and dangerous Distemper; 
to such, and such only, have I ever advised a 
total rigid Milk and vegetable Diet, with 
aqueous Liquors; but no longer to be con-
tinued, than till the Symptoms were extremely 
mitigated, or intirely overcome; and then, if it 
was after the Meridian of Life, to be persisted 
in obstinatly; if long before it, to be gradu-
ally and cautiously alter'd into common Life 
with great Temperance; and I know all ho-
nest and experienced Physicians, antient and 
modern, are and must be of the same Mind. 

§. 8. The great and essential Difference be-
tweenanimal and vegetable Food, is much 
the same as between Chemical and Gale-
nical Medicins. Chemical Medicins are the 
suppos'd (at least their most active) Virtues 
and Qualities of Plants, Metals and Mi-
nerals, contracted and concentred into a 
small Volume, by the Tortures of the Fire; 
their useless or destructive Parts separated and 
thrown away, and their useful and sanative
Qualities compacted and united into an imme-
|P_xxii
diatContact and condensed. They would be 
of admirable Use and Convenience, if these sup-
pos'dFacts, and such mentioned Virtues, were 
just, solid and true, or if an animal Body could 
bear them without greater or more fatal future 
Injuries, than their present Benefit (how great 
soever) or Convenience can compensat. But 
it is most certain, that such Medicins, Drugs
or Bodies, are the most destructive to animal 
Bodies, if long and in great Quantities thrown 
in, that Malice can invent, beyond Gun-
powder itself and even spirituous Liquors; for 
not only Nature has provided none such, but as 
Poisons in venomous Creatures to kill their 
Enemies, or cook them for their Food: but 
that the Particles of Fire, the most destructive 
of any, are so closely impacted and transubstan-
tiated in, as never to be afterwards sepa-
rated from them, and that their component 
Particles are so minutely divided by the Tor-
tures of the Fire, as to acquire such a Force of 
Attraction towards the Particles of animal 
Bodies; such a Polarity, (as Dr. Listerob-
served, in all Calcinations, both of Vege-
tables and Minerals, so constantly to answer 
the Magnet) that they become Iron, Bristles,
Nails and Lancets, darting directly and per-
pendicularly into the Solids, so as quickly to 
tear, rend and destroy, or fix them, and so can 
never be proper for Food or Physic; whereas 
Galenical Medicins, consisting of the integral 
Particles of Vegetables, Metals or Minerals,
|P_xxiii
dissolved only by gentle Heat and Moisture, in a 
watry Menstruum, have none of these deleterious
Qualities on animal Bodies, but become their 
Food as well as Physic, and naturally take the 
Places of the morbid Particles of animal Habits, 
which Time and the natural Functions mecha-
nically throw off. Just so animal Food, and fer-
mented Liquors, are the smallest, most element-
ary and attractive Particles, united and concen-
ter'd like the Rays of the Sun in the Focus of 
a Burning-glass. Their delicious Flavour and 
Savour consists in their greater abundance of 
Oil and Salts, which are the most active, and 
consequently the most destructive to animal 
Bodies. If they are sufficiently diluted, and 
their Volume and Quantity increas'd, by the 
more innocent and unactive Particles of fine 
Earth and Water, they may be safely used, 
approaching thereby very near to Vegetables.
Juices and fermented Liquors, much diluted 
with Water, become the nearest Approxima-
tion to pure Water, the only Beveragede-
signed and fitted by Nature for long Life, 
Health and Serenity; and the whole Study of 
the Patient, and Intention of the Physician,
ought to be to find out this just Mediocrity
of animal and vegetable Food, when com-
bin'd, for Aliment, and of fermented and 
aqueous Liquors mix'd for Beverage, which 
is the most proper for preserving his Health, or 
curcing his Disorders; for there is very little 
in the Specification of the Diet, whether it 
|P_xxiv
be all Vegetable, or partly Animal, partly Ve-
getable, some Vegetables being more delete-
rious to animal Constitutions than some ani-
mal Substances; and there is but a very little 
Difference between pure warm Water, and 
cold Water warm'd with a very little Wine; 
the just Mixture and Proportion suited to the 
Constitution and Distempers of the Patient, is 
by far the greatest Affair; tho' in the Distem-
pers by me just now specified, that are painful 
and dangerous, too great Exactness, both in 
Quantity and Quality, is never to be slighted; 
for in a true statical Balance, such as the Con-
stitutions under the mentioned Diseases are, 
a few Grains or Spoonfuls thrown in, will de-
stroy the Equilibrium of Health and Ease. 

§. 9. THE Benefits a Person who desires 
nothing but a clear Head and strong intellec-
tual Faculties, would reap by religiously 
drinking nothing but Water, (tepid or cold, 
as the Season is) while he is yet young, and 
tolerably healthy, well educated, and of a sober 
honest Disposition, are innumerable: As, 1. 
That he would live probably till towards an 
hundred Years of Age, that being the Term 
of Life appointed by the Design of the Creator, 
even after the Deluge, and after that eating 
of animal Food was permitted, before (as it 
is believ'd) fermented Liquors were invented; 
at least, if we have any regard for Moses's 
History, which yet cannot be denied to be one 
|P_xxv
of the justest Accounts of these early Times. 
2. That he would thereby constantly enjoy a 
clear Head, calm, at least governable Passions, 
a Facility in intellectual Applications, and in 
the Acquisition of Virtue; and so having a 
longer Duration secur'd to him, and all Impedi-
ments removed, he might make surprizing and 
wonderful Advances in both. 3. He would 
thereby be secur'd against all the great atrocious
and frightful Distempers, such as Melancholy, 
Lowness of Spirits, Wrong-headedness, Lu-
nacy and Madness (the Bane of the finest, best 
and most penetrating Spirits in Great Britain). 
For I defy any Man to give an Instance of any 
furious Madness, or great and obstinat Lu-
nacy or Melancholy, in any one who soon 
after Twenty, enter'd on Water drinking only, 
let him eat what he can; for it is fermented
Liquors only that inflame the Membrans and 
membranous Tubuli (the Nerves), which are 
the bodily Organs of intellectual Operations. 
It is the Fire, Sulphur and volatile Tartar of 
fermented Liquors, that inflame, corrugat and 
stimulat these Membranes, and their linear 
Threads, into violent Succussions, that break 
and tear them, which are the immediat Cause 
of these frightful and overwhelming Distem-
pers, as they are of the painful tortureing ones, 
Gout, Stone, Cancer and Consumption: For 
tho' Gluttony will thicken the Curd of the 
Blood, and thereby cause Obstructions in the 
Glands and Capillaries, from whence many 
|P_xxvi
and various Distempers may arise, yet will they 
be of the obtuse, slow, lingering Kind, and in 
which Nature will always give a timeous and 
early Warning, by Inappetency, Nausea, Vo-
miting, Purging, Sweating, Spitting or 
Rheums, which will opportunely stop the Pro-
gress; and while Water is plentifully then 
craved and given, it will carry on, distance in 
the Circulation, and dilute this too viscid 
Curd, to prevent an intire Obstruction of the 
animal Functions, or destroy Life, and hinder 
the Generation of Gout, Stone, Cancer and 
Consumption, which are solely produc'd by 
the hard salin Concretions of fermentedLi-
quors. But, 4. The most signal Benefit a Man 
will reap from early Water-drinking solely, 
while as yet in tolerable Health, is being pre-
serv'd from the acute, sudden and mortalDis-
tempers, as Apoplexies, Suffocations, Fevers
of all kinds, Pestilences and Pleurisies. It is 
to fermented, strong, or spirituous Liquors 
solely, that these quick and destructive Distem-
pers owe their true Cause, which give no 
Warning, and admit of no Cure: At least, 
Water-drinking solely, is the only Preservative, 
I am certain, known or knowable to Art. 
Accidents, epidemical Causes, a constant Neg-
lect, or a total Inability to guard against the 
Dangers of the other Non-naturals, absolutly 
necessary towards perfect Health and Life, 
may produce some Degrees of these mention'd 
grand Distempers; but then, under sole Water- 
|P_xxvii
drinking, they will neither be so painful nor 
dangerous: For it is certain, Water-drinking, 
Dilution, and thin Diet, is the only Mean 
known to Art and Experience, to cure them, 
when Persons are already seiz'd with these Dis-
tempers, join'd with strong and proper Evacu-
ations; and whatever will cure, will prevent; 
as Water pour'd on will extinguish Fire, so it 
will prevent its being kindled or beginning. 
If these frightful, painful and mortal Distem-
pers happen sometimes in Eastern or Southern
Climats, where fermented Liquors are not 
much in Use, it is because they wallow and 
indulge in some things almost equally as per-
nicious and inflammatory as these strongLi-
quors, as high in Aromaticks, eastern Gums and 
Juices; Opiats, the volatile cepacious Roots, 
Fruits and Seeds, of the poisonous, sopori-
ferous or stimulating kind, with which those 
Climats abound, which is the sole Cause of all 
their inflammatory Distempers, and unnatural 
and dissolveing Lust; for these are all but dry 
Drams, of a more dureable and adhesive 
Nature than some of the liquid ones; for Fire 
is still Fire, whether Solar or Culinary, Na-
tural or Chemical; whether it is transubstan-
tiated into liquid or solider Matter; and Wa-
ter is its only Extinguisher. 

§. 10. I have said, that the Quantity of 
Aliment (Meats and Drinks) is of much 
greater Consequence in general, than the 
|P_xxviii
Quality, for the Preservation of Life, Health 
and Serenity. If a Man study the least, light 
or heavy will not so much incommode him. 
The great End and Use of a low Diet, or one 
of Milk, Seeds and Vegetables, is to mend 
the Juices, to cool, attenuat and sweeten the 
circulating Fluids; whatever Diet does this, 
must mechanically relax, unbend, and let 
down the Spring of the Solids. It is true, 
the Superiority of the Force or Spring of the 
Solids, must be always greater than the Re-
sistance of the Fluids; else the Animal could 
not live at all; that is, the animal Functions
could not be perform'd; and this Superiority
must be continued in some Proportion, whatever 
Regimen the Animal uses, so long as it lives. 
But it is certain, a cool, thin, sweetning Diet, 
attenuats the Fluids in a greater Proportion
than it relaxes and unbends the Solids; be-
cause, 1. All the Secretions are from the 
Fluids, and not from the Solids; and they 
spending and wasting faster, must be sooner 
supply'd and alter'd by the proper Food. 2. Be-
cause the immediat Action of Food and Physic
is upon the Fluids, and they absorb and con-
sume most of their Virtue and Efficacy; and 
the Solids are never acted upon by them, till 
the Fluids are fully saturated and transubstan-
tiated into their Substance. And, 3. Because 
all Fluids by their Nature are sooner and more 
readily acted upon, and alter'd into foreign 
Qualities, than any Solids possibly can; and 
|P_xxix
hence it comes to pass, that a Person on the 
immediat Change, and for some considerable 
Time after, in passing from a high to a low 
Diet, will find his Health wonderfully 
mended for the better, because the Resistance 
of the Fluids is immediatly lessen'd; which 
will again, even under the same Diet in Quan-
tity and Quality, wonderfully, and, as it were, 
unaccountably totter, and alter for the worse; 
which happens on the Despumation of the 
Glands, Capillaries and Solids, while they are 
spewing out and disgorgeing their morbidCon-
tents on the Primæ Viæ; but which, by proper 
and specific Evacuations, Exercise and Astrin-
gents afterwards, will generally be set to rights 
again, if the Person be at a proper Time of Life, 
that is, under Fifty; for after that, there is little 
Encouragement from any Mean, but gentle 
Evacuation, and a Perseverance in the regu-
lated Regimen: Nay, even he must pro-
ceed, lessening it in Quantity at least, if not 
in Quality, by proper Degrees, and at pro-
per Periods, descending out of Life, as one 
ascends into it, viz. by Milk-Porridge, Water-
Gruel, Panada, and the like. But the great 
Benefit and Advantage a Man reaps from a 
low, cool, thinning, sweetning Regimen, of 
Milk, Seeds and Vegetables, above what he 
can have under any Diet of animal Food and 
fermented Liquors, is, that he can keep the 
stretched and extended Bowels, and Blood-
Vessels, always fuller and plumper, and in their 
|P_xxx
natural Tension and Situations; and consequently 
will make the Secretions more plentifully, and 
all the Functions will be more natural, and easier, 
than under a spare, cautious and anxiously 
guarded starving Regimen of so little animal
Food as is absolutly necessary; as a weak Person 
will walk more easily in Stays than loose, some 
lame Persons in a Boot than a Stocking; and a 
defensive Plaister will keep a Sore easier, than 
when it is bare; and Excesses are neither so pain-
ful nor dangerous under the first as under the 
second Regimen; and the same Person may 
safely venture on at least four times as much 
Vegetable, Seed and Milk Food, as he dare of 
animal Food of any kind, at least of dense, 
hard, or full-grown animal Food. 

§. 11. I think the natural Order and Pro-
gression in Regimen, for those who are or-
dain'd to, or for those whose Vocation and 
Occupation is sedentary and studious, who by 
the Order of Providence, and Situation of 
Life, have been signatur'd to intellectual Pro-
fessions, and for all those who would cultivat 
and maintain clear Heads and quick Senses
to the last, is from their Birth till Fifteen, to 
persevere in a gradually increasing temperat 
Diet, without fermented Liquors; from Fifteen 
to Fifty, to be only temperat in animal Foods 
and fermented Liquors; after Fifty to give up 
animal Food Suppers, and fermented Liquors; 
after Sixty to give up all animal Food; and 
|P_xxxi
then every ten Years after to lessen about a 
quarter of the Quantity of their vegetable
Food; and thus gradually descend out of Life 
as they ascended into it. And that all Persons 
subject to inflammatory Distempers, Gouts, 
Erisipelas's, hot Scurvies, Leprosies, Asthma's, 
Jaundices, Colicks, nervous Lownesses, vio-
lent Head-aches, Haemorrhages and Hæmor-
rhoids, Anasarca's, Ruptures, or white Swel-
lings, tho' otherwise strong, hearty, hale, and 
of a seeming sound Constitution, ought to 
give up Meat Suppers, and all fermented Li-
quors; and that the Children of all Fathers 
(for Mothers are not here to be minded) who 
have died before Thirty-five, of any natural 
Distemper whatever, and all the Children 
begot of Fathers after Sixty, ought to live 
without Meat Suppers, or fermented Liquors; 
and that all Persons whatever, whatever Age 
they be of, or of whatever Nature their Com-
plaints and Disorder may be, if, upon repeated 
small Phlebotomies, and without transient 
Accidents, (as Colds, Damps, Blasts, and 
Bruises) they constantly observe their Blood 
sizy, viscous and glutinous, ought directly to 
be put on a low Diet, either of Milk, Seeds 
and Vegetables only, or at least of one, with-
out Meat Suppers, and fermented Liquors; and 
this Regimen, with proper attenuant, alterative 
and sweetning Medicines, (which, in the Na-
ture of things, ought to be of the mild pon-
derous and mineral Tribe) to be continued 
|P_xxxii
till at least this Size and Glew be broken and 
dissolved; else they can never expect uniform 
and continued Health; for such a Regimen, 
and such Medicins, must do this in Time; else 
nothing in Nature possibly can. 

§. 12. UNPHILOSOPHICAL and 
unexperienced Persons, tho' they know and 
observe the great critical Alteration that hap-
pens in the Sex, in or about Fifty, and that 
without a special Care, both in the Regimen,
proper Evacuation, and alterative Medicins, 
they are in great Danger, either of their Lives, 
or of some chronical and obstinat Distempers, 
that make their Lives ever after miserable and 
uncomfortable, after that Period; yet think this 
Misfortune peculiar to Females, and that 
the Males have a Privilege and Security to be 
luxurious and sensual to the last; which is the 
true Reason why so few die natural Deaths,
and that most pass as really and truly out of 
Life, in a violent untimely Manner, as a 
Felon, who suffers under public Justice. The 
Matter of Fact and Order of Nature is this: 
Fifty was design'd as the Meridian of Life, in 
this our lapsed; State and Duration, on this 
ruinous Planet; from this solstitial Point it 
is a Descent out of Life. From the Birth
upwards to this Point, the Solids were deve-
lopeing, expanding, crusting over, and harden-
ing to their utmost Extension, Firmness and 
Density; and thereby their Elasticity beginning 
|P_xxxiii
then at Fifty to weaken and unbend, and they 
to ossify, the Digestions become grosser and 
more imperfect, the Secretions lessen, and all 
the animal Functions labour; and then, if 
due Care is not taken to obviat these Effects, 
the chronical Distempers naturally arising out of 
these Causes, and that lurked in the original Con-
stitution, begin to emerge and sprout out, the 
Viscera to tumify and obstruct, the Glands then 
swell and press on the circulating Blood-Vessels, 
the Capillaries to coalesce, become full and 
dense, and the Nerves and Membranes are 
interrupted in their Play and Vibrations, 
and all the animal Machin labours, and the 
Functions are perform'd heavily, with Pain 
and Struggle. This is the true Time and 
Season of Life, for Attention, Consideration 
and Care of a wise Man and a Philosopher.
The Hyperbolic Curve of Life is at the Point 
of its Return downwards again; and if then 
proper Care be taken, by some few Evacua-
tions, Alteratives, and a Regimen; to put a 
Drag on the Wheels of Life, that they may 
go down gently, calmly and serenely, these 
become more useful to themselves and 
others, than in the first ascending part of Life; 
and this happens equally to both the Sexes:
for it is not from this Season being the common 
Period of the Fertility of the Female Sex, that 
these Appearances happen; but is a general 
Law of Nature to both Sexes from the 
Causes assign'd; for all the Difference of the 
|P_xxxiv
Sexes lies in the different Configuration of the 
superinduc'd Crust or Shell laid over the pri-
mitiveaethereal Body, which in both is pro-
bably pretty near of the same Figure, Size and 
Materials, originally. 

§. 13. It is not an unpleasant Speculation,
to contemplat the Order of Nature in its Pro-
gression towards reducing this our Tabernacle 
of Clay, into its original Dust, from its Cradle 
to its Coffin, especially in those who live the 
whole Duration of the natural Life. The 
Diseases of Infancy are generally Scabs, 
Blotches and Blains over the Face, Head, Eyes 
and Ears; sometimes Fits and Convulsions, 
and such Cephalic and Head Distempers; and 
these are certainly constitutional and parental
Disorders communicated by the morbid Juices 
of the Parents; the Colicks, Vomitings and 
Diarrhoea's succeeding, come from the impro-
per Nourishment in Quantity or Quality of the 
Mothers or Nurses; the Measles and Small-pox
are also original and parental Impurities convey'd 
to the Blood and Juices in the Birth, from too 
high and too much animal Food, and are most 
of them the Diseases of the upper Region of 
the Body. When Nature has struggled by these 
to purify the Juices by such Despumations,
then come the Distempers of the Breast and 
Lungs, in Coughs, Catarrhs, Consumptions, 
Asthma's, Pleurisies or Peripneumonies; after 
these come Pains in the Stomach, Heart-burnings,
|P_xxxv
Colicks, bilious Vomitings, Jaun-
dice and Diarrhoea's; then succeed Gouts, 
Stone and Gravel, Palsies, Rheumatisms and 
fixing of the Joints; and very often Ruptures, 
Piles, or Mortifications in the Bowels, Feet,
or Toes, the Diseases of the lower Regions. 
All I would insinuat by this Reflection, is, 
that Nature seems to aim, and would certain-
ly, if not interrupted by Accidents, obtain and 
pursue a kind of a regular and uniform Pro-
gression, in her Course of dissolving and 
mouldering into Dust, this Adamical Crust of 
Clay, by Distempers, topical and local, from 
the Head, through the Viscera, to the Feet
and Joints, till, like a dying Vegetable, she 
has fix'd it in the Earth, from whence it 
sprung. This is certainly her general Law,
if not interrupted by original, parentalDis-
eases or Accidents hurting some of the Or-
gans before it was born, or by Accidentspro-
per and peculiar to the Party itself; or a ge-
neralbad Regimen, which may quicken this 
Progress, or throw it out of its natural Pro-
gression on a weaken'd Part, that may discom-
pose the general Law of Nature.

§. 14. For Perspicuity and Brevity, I di-
stinguishfour Orders and Degrees of Regimen 
of Diet, that is, of Meat and Drink; viz.
1. The common Diet of a reasonable Propor-
tion of animal Food and fermented Liquors,
common to the middling Rank of the Healthy, 
|P_xxxvi
Temperat and Sober in every Climat or Coun-
try. 2. A Diet of plain fresh animal Food 
once a Day, without any fermented Liquor, 
only plain Water, or Toast and tepid Water 
for Beverage; or one of one Day Meat with-
outWine, and another Day a little Winewith-
outMeat, which I would call the trimming
 Diet. 3. A Diet without any animal Food,
but one of Milk, Seeds, Fruits and Vegetables,
any thing where the Life of no Animal is 
wanted to compose or dress such (as Eggs, 
Gravey, and the like). 4. A total strict Milk
and Seed Diet only, without any other Ma-
terials. Of these I intend to say something in 
general, and in this Order, both as to their 
Times and Cookery. But first as to the Order,
or Time of changeing any one of these diffe-
rent kinds of Regimen one for another. 

§. 15. When a Person is tolerably well, 
and is subject to no painful or dangerous Dis-
temper, I think it his Duty, and the Order of 
God and Providence, to let Well alone; and 
with general Temperance, without Solicitude, 
Anxiety or Scrupulosity, to persevere in the 
common Regimen of the middling healthy 
temperat Order of Men, in the Country and 
Climat where he was born, or long habitu-
ated: To follow St. Paul's Advice in another 
Case, to ask no Questions about what he should 
eat for Health's sake; or rather our Saviour's 
Counsel, not to be solicitous, or take anxious
|P_xxxvii
Care, about what he should eat, or what he 
should drink, or wherewithal he should be 
cloathed; but without Curiosity or Nicety, 
take a Share of whatever is presented: For to 
live at such a Time, and in such a Circumstance, 
medically, is truly to live miserably, and 
propter vitam vivendi perdere causas. It is 
enough, for a wise Man, and a Christian Phi-
losopher, to stop, and attend to Diet and Re-
gimen, when, by the Order of Providence, his 
natural and providential Course of common Re-
gimen is barr'd up, by some Disorder or Distem-
per; and then wise Nature will give him 
timeous Warning, by Inappetency, a Nausea,
Reaching, Vomiting, a Flatulence, Fulness or 
Pain in the Stomach; for all Distempers begin 
first at the Stomach or Bowels, and then 
ascend to the Head, which is the Language 
of the God of Nature, saying to the Person, 
Man, take Care; and then, and only then, 
ought a Christian Philosopher mind his Re-
gimen, and by Evacuation, moderat Fasting
or Exercise, endeavour to relieve or remove 
the Grief, or apply to some honest experienced 
Physician for Advice. 

§. 16. IF the Case is acute, the Party is 
not generally, at least for any Time, in a Con-
dition to observe or direct for himself: But 
seldom any notable Errors are committed in 
Regimen then; for on the slightest Attempts 
to any great Excess, either in Quantity or 
|P_xxxviii
Quality, Nature immediatly revolts, and the 
Party suffers to such an Extremity, by the 
Exacerbations of his Symptoms, that any 
notable Progress in such an unnatural Regimen
cannot possibly be receiv'd or persisted in; and 
yet I have seen and felt, by the Indiscretion of 
Friends, or the officious Sedulity of Nurses,
the poor Patient suffer to mortal Agonies, and 
sometimes to Death, in acute Cases, by im-
proper Loads of high Foods, or liquid or solid 
Drams and Cordials; and many have suffer'd 
more from high and hot Drugs, than ever they 
could from the Distemper. In acute Cases,
seldom any thing that is given either for Food
or Physic, passes the Primae Viae, unless it be 
extremely light and liquid. In such, the wiser 
Antients scarce ever administred (besides proper 
Evacuation) any thing but tepid Water, simple 
Oxymel, or Water soften'd, or sharpned by the 
Flour or Meal of some proper or specific Ve-
getable. Long obstinat Fasting, continued 
even ad Deliquium, with plentiful Dilution,
and the Evacuation indicated by the Nature of 
the Distemper, was their most universal Re-
medy. But it is not of Regimen in acute 
Cases that I here intend to speak; my sole 
Business is with chronical Cases. 

§. 17. But since chronical Cases are only 
acute Cases diluted, and drawn out into a 
longer Time, with weaker Paroxysins, and a 
more protracted Crise; since Nature has a 
|P_xxxix
general Law and Type, by which she governs 
and signatures such acute Distempers, especi-
ally in those who follow her Laws and Sim-
plicity, and not disturbed by spurious Art or 
Accidents; since Fasting, proper Evacuation,
and Dilution, are the great Remedies indi-
cated in acute Cases; it is natural and highly 
probable to suppose, that proper Evacuation,
Abstinence, and thin cool soft Regimen longer 
persisted in, will be the single Intention pointed 
out, and the great and cardinal Remedies in 
chronical Cases; and therefore, when a Per-
son, under common Life, is seized with a 
chronical Distemper, which by prudent Absti-
nence, and lessening the Quantity of this com-
mon Diet, is not remov'd, he ought to apply 
to the proper Directors of Health, and follow 
their Advice religiously, in the Use of Medi-
cins and Regimen they order; and if in three 
Months time, in chronical Cases, by rigorously 
pursuing the order'd Medicins and Regimen, 
their Symptoms are not totally remov'd, or 
greatly reliev'd and mitigated, he may, I think, 
fairly conclude the Regimen was not low, 
cool and thin enough, for the End propos'd; 
and therefore ought to resolve to sink his Re-
gimen, both in Quantity and Quality, and 
enter upon what I call the trimming Diet.

§. 18. But before any Person resolves to 
sink or alter his Regimen of Diet, or any pru-
dentPhysician ought to advise such an Altera-
|P_xl
tion, he ought always to premise a gentle par-
tialPhlebotomy out at the largest Vein, and 
from the largest Orifice commonly open'd; for 
a small Trunk of a Vein will only send out 
such Blood as is much different from the Crase
of the whole Mass; the Circulation being 
slower in the small Branches, the Visci-
dity is generally impacted into the smallest in a 
greater Proportion, and the serous Part by the 
Slowness is perspired or run off, by the Lym-
phatics, and lateral Branches; and a small 
Orifice either compresses and breaks the Tex-
ture of the Curd of the Blood, disunites and 
separates the Globules, so that the Observation 
cannot be fairly or with any Degree of Accu-
racy made; but by comparing the Blood so 
let out, with other sound healthy Blood, (for 
Example, that of a healthy Person, or of a 
Bullock or Sheep) if the Difference in Taste, 
Colour, Cohesion of the Globules, and Curd,
and the Proportion thereof to the Serum, be 
in all or most of these Distinctions, greatly 
different from those of the sound Blood, it 
may fairly be concluded that the Regimen of 
Diet, both in Quantity and Quality, is to be 
sunk and lessen'd, and that proper and specific
alterative Medicins, to thin and sweeten the 
Blood, are indicated, (especially those of the 
mild ponderous Nature at first, with the Gale-
nical Vegetables, which universal Experience 
has assign'd as specific in a Distemper of such a 
Denomination) and the Evacuations of the 
|P_xli
Primæ Viæ by gentle Vomits and domestic 
Cathartics, as the Symptoms exasperat; for 
tho' a Person may still suffer, even when the 
Blood thus let out for Experiment's sake, mostly 
appears, on such gross Experiments, tolerably 
good, and not differing greatly from sound 
Blood in the Size, the bad Juices being confin'd 
to the Capillaries, Glands and great Viscera; 
yet these will never be open'd and render'd per-
vious, till the Blood in the great Trunks of 
the Vessels be first attenuated, thin'd and 
sweeten'd: And he will never be long or uni-
formly well, who has bad Juicescirculat-
ing, in these greater Vessels; it is a certain 
Symptom, that it must be much worse and 
more sizy in the small lateral Branches, the 
Capillaries, and the Glands of the Viscera; 
and it is Diet alone, and it chiefly, join'd with 
mild ponderous Remedies at first, Evacua-
tion, Air and Exercise, that can at last 
alter or antidote these morbific Symptoms. 
And if after three Months Use of the Medi-
cins advis'd in chronical Cases, by an honest 
experienced Physician, the Blood on such a 
Trial continues bad, that is, sizy, liverish,
with either too little Serum tho' clear, or too 
much but muddy, then, I think, the trimming 
Diet ought to be tried, viz. one of white 
Meat in a moderat Quantity once a Day, with 
Milk, Seeds and Vegetables, for the other 
Meals, and aqueous Beverage; or one Day a 
little plain Meat of any kind once a Day, with 
|P_xlii
aqueous Beverage that Day, and the next Day 
only Milk, Seeds and Vegetables, with about 
a Gill of some sound old Wine, with or with-
out Water; and this Regimen, with a due 
Care of the other Non-naturals, proper Eva-
cuation, and due Exercise, I think, ought to be 
continued for one whole Year or two, in obstinat 
hereditary chronical Cases; for, I think, ac-
quir'd ones will scarce require so long Time, 
or such Severity of Regimen, to be cured, or 
at least greatly alleviated, unless their Excesses 
have been violent, or that they are far advanced 
in Life. 

§. 19. But since such Cases do daily happen, 
both in hereditary Distempers, and those ac-
quir'd by an obstinat Mal-regimen long con-
tinued in; that after a full Twelvemonth or more 
of a trimming Regimen of Diet, with proper 
Evacuation, and specific Alteratives, the Blood, 
on makeing the Trial, as above described, con-
tinues still bad and sizy, then, I think, all Medicin 
(except domestic Evacuations or Alteratives) 
may be fairly cashier'd and laid aside, as of little 
or no Use, and the whole Stress and Hope laid 
on Diet and Regimen only, by sinking it in 
Quantity as well as Quality, and confineing 
one's self to Milk, Seeds, Fruits and Vege-
tables, well dress'd, or much dissolv'd by culi-
nary Fire, to evaporat the Wind; and drink-
ing only tepid Water, or some specific mineral 
Water, as the Case requires, and Wine only 
|P_xliii
as other Persons use Spirits, on dangerous Sym-
ptoms, as a Cordial, and on Extremities; and 
this Method and Regimen ought to be conti-
nued for two Years more at least. And, I think, 
in Persons of a tolerable Constitution, and 
where some of the great Viscera are not intire-
ly spoil'd and irremediably consumed, this Me-
thod and Diet cannot fail of having salutary 
Effects of a perfect Cure, or a very considera-
ble Relief; and then if the Party is not past 
the Meridian of Life, the Person may without 
Fear or Danger, gradually and by slow Degrees, 
rise again to the trimming Diet, and from it 
return back again by the same Steps he descended 
into common Life; and only on Exacerba-
tions, and stated Seasons, sink into his lower 
Regimen, for a Preservative. 

§. 20. But after all this Care and Perseve-
rance in a milk, seed and vegetable Diet, with 
aqueous Beverage, if on a Trial after the man-
ner mentioned, the Blood be still sizy, as it often 
is in bad Constitutions, and obstinat Cases, and 
the Symptoms, still severe and depressing; the 
only thing remaining for such a Person with 
any Reason or Expectation of Success of a 
total Cure, or any notable Alleviation of his 
Symptoms, is, for the Person to enter on a 
total rigid strict milk and seed Diet only,
without Butter, Eggs, or any other Vegetables, 
but Wheat, Barley, Rice, Oats, Sago, and the 
like seed Meats; and even to make his Milk the 
|P_xliv
thinnest possible, skim'd Milk, sweet Butter-
milk, sweet Whey, or the Whey made with 
a Mixture of sour Milk, or Orange-Whey, or 
Whey made with the Juice of some specific 
Vegetable, (especially in scorbutic, gouty, pul-
monic and icteric Cases, which is the Base of 
most of the chronical Distempers in England) 
and Bread or Seeds dress'd made with Milk 
only; for Seeds are young Vegetables, and are 
neither so hard of Digestion, so windy, nor 
abound with the essential Salts of Plants, Roots 
and Fruits. And even the Quantity of the Regi-
men is to be minded; little at a time, but oftener, 
never either to load the Stomach, nor compress 
the Nerves, Membranes and Fibres; Fulness 
and Compression, even by such Foods, like 
Stops in musical Chords, will interrupt their 
easy, regular and harmonious Vibrations and 
Play, and so will sink the Spirits, and make 
the Functions labour. This Regimen ought 
at last to be tried, all other Methods not suc-
ceeding. One would not buy Gold too dear; 
but Health and free Spirits are more precious 
than Gold, and a wise Man would give up 
every thing else for them. This Regimen will 
infallibly have one of these two Effects; it will 
either totally cure him, if the great Viscera
are not quite consumed; or make him lie 
down more easily, and will infallibly give him 
longer Time and better Spirits to settle his 
temporal Affairs, and give all the Attention to 
his future State, the Nature of Things will 
then admit.
