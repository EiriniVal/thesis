[}CHAP. II. }]
[}Rules of Diet in the different Constitu-
tions of Human Bodies. }]
[}Lax and weak Fibres. }]
PAleness, a weak Pulse, Palpita-
tions of the Heart, flabby and 
slack Flesh, Laziness, Lassitude, Bloat-
edness, scorbutical Spots are Symp-
toms of weak Fibres. 

Leanness is no Sign of weak Fibres, 
for though the bundle of Fibres which 
constitute the Muscle may be small, 
the Fibres themselves may be strong 
and springy. 

Such as have weak Fibres ought 
to avoid all great Evacuations, espe-
cially Letting of Blood, Substances 
viscous, and hard of Digestion, a se-
dentary Life, and moist Air. 

They ought to take Aliment fre-
quently, in small Quantities, nourish-
|P_284
ing, and of easy Digestion, such as 
Milk, Broths and Jellies of Flesh 
Meat, Panadas, &c. Their Drinks 
ought to be austere Wines mix'd 
with Water, or any Wine mix'd with 
chalybeat Water; and to use in their 
Aliment styptick austere Vegetables, 
such as are enumerated No 1, as far 
as their Stomachs can bear them. 

[}Too strong and springy Fibres. }]
A Body hard, dry, scraggy, hairy,
warm, with firm and rigid Muscles, 
a strong Pulse, Activity and Prompt-
ness in Animal Actions, are Signs of 
strong, rigid, and elastick Fibres. 

Such Constitutions are subject to 
inflammatory Distempers. 

They ought to avoid the Diet pro-
per in the contrary State. 

Their Nourishment ought to be 
emollient and cooling, the Pulps, 
Juices, Jellies, Mucilages, and De-
coctions of Vegetables mentioned 
|P_285
No 2. animal Oils, and all things 
which relax and increase Fat, avoid-
ing all things seasoned with Spice 
and Salt: Their Drink, Water, Bar-
ley-Water, Whey; and especially to 
avoid fermented Spirits, which to 
such are extremely hurtful. 

Bathing in tepid Water is benefi-
cial to such Constitutions, and im-
moderate Labour or Excercise hurt-
ful. 

[}Plethorick Constitutions. }]
The Signs of a Plethorick Con-
stitution, or of such as abound with 
laudable animal Fluids, are evident. 

The Causes of it are a good Sto-
mach, nourishing Diet, a good Di-
gestion, little Exercise, much Sleep, 
and Suppression of usual Evacuations, 
especially Perspiration; therefore the 
avoiding these, and inducing their 
Contraries, are the proper Cure. 

|P_286
 A plethorick Constitution is sub-
ject to a Stoppage of the Circula-
tion, and consequently to Suffoca-
tion, Ruptures of the Vessels, and 
sudden Death; therefore it ought to 
be speedily broke by proper artificial 
Evacuations, and restoring the usual 
natural ones. 

Long Abstinence is not proper for 
plethorick Constitutions, for it thick-
ens the Fluids; frequent Blood-let-
ting, in small Quantities, often in-
creaseth the Force of the Organs of 
Digestion, fattens, and increaseth the 
Distemper. 

They ought to avoid oily and 
nourishing Substances; watery Ve-
getables, as being less nourish-
ing than animal Diet, are proper; 
and Fish rather than Flesh: In a 
Lent Diet People commonly fall a-
way. 

|P_287
[}Sanguineous Constitutions. }]
Such are known by their Com-
plexion, or Colour of their Counte-
nance and Skin: They are subject to 
Hæmorrages, Inflammations, es-
pecially of the Lungs, Impostuma-
tions, and often to scrophulous Dis-
tempers. 

All things which accelerate the 
Motion of the Blood are hurtful to 
sanguineous Constitutions, as violent 
Exercise and Watching. 

Acid Substances, No 5, especially 
Vinegar, are useful; the copious Use 
of Vinegar brings Paleness. 

The sanguineous ought to avoid 
the copious Use of all things that a-
bound with an acrimonious Salt 
and high exalted Oil, as Mustard, 
Onions, Garlick, Leeks, the Herbs 
us'd in Seasoning, mention'd No 6, 
and in general, all Spices. 

|P_288
[}Constitutions subject to Acidity. }]
Sour Belchings, a craving Appe-
tite sometimes of unusual things, as 
in the Case of the Green-Sickness, 
Colical Pains, dry Gripes, change of 
the colour of the Bile from Yellow 
towards Green, a sour Smell in the 
Excrements and Sweat, paleness of 
the Skin, lowness of the Pulse, and 
some sort of Eruptions of the Skin, 
are the common Signs of such a 
Constitution. 

The chief Seat of Acidity is in 
the Stomach and Intestines, from 
whence it will sometimes pass into 
the Blood, and other Juices. 

Such ought to abstain from the 
copious use of acid alimentary Sub-
stances, mention'd No 5, they ought 
not to eat much Bread, nor take great 
Quantities of mealy Substances, nor 
drink much of fermented Liquor 
especially sour and thin Wines. 

|P_289
Their Diet ought to be rather of 
animal Substances than vegetable: 
The Flesh of those Animals which 
live upon other Animals is most an-
ti-acid, as several Birds, and Water-
Fowl; tho' those are offensive to the 
Stomach sometimes, by reason of 
their Oiliness. Vegetable and ani-
mal Oils are often agreeable to such 
Stomachs, as Almonds, Pistachos, 
Cream, Butter, Marrow. 

Their Diet ought to consist, in 
general, of Substances mentioned 
No 4. 

Water or Wine not sour or thin, 
is their proper Drink. 

They ought to use much Labour 
or Exercise, for labouring People have 
commonly a good Digestion, and 
subdue the Acidity of their Ali-
ment. 

Acidity in the sucking Infant is to 
be cured by an alkaline Diet in the 
Nurse. 

|P_290
To know whether Eruptions of 
the Skin come from an acid or alka-
line Cause, one must attend to the 
previous Diet and the concomitant 
Symptoms; (Children, by eating un-
ripe Fruit often, have Eruptions up-
on their Skin) the Lentor, itching 
Colour, and State of such Eruptions, 
not inflammatory, nor tending to 
Suppuration, point rather to an acid 
Cause, and the Success of the Cure 
often demonstrates the same, such 
being often heal'd by animal alka-
line Salts. 

[}Constitutions abounding with a spon-
taneous Alkali. }]
This Constitution is more natural 
to Human Bodies, because all animal 
Substances are alkalescent. 

Heat, Thirst, hot nidorose Belch-
ings, Foulness of the Tongue and Pa-
late, a bitter and hot Taste in the 
Mouth, Sickness, Loathing, bilious 
|P_291
Vomitings, Stools with a cadaverous 
Smell, Pains in the Belly, with Heat, 
are Symptoms of an alkaline State 
of the Humours in the Stomach and 
Bowels. 

Such a State disposeth the Hu-
mours of the whole Body to Heat, 
Inflammations, and Putrefaction, hin-
ders Nutrition, and often causeth 
Eruptions on the Skin, dark, livid, 
lead-colour'd and gangrenous, and 
what is commonly called the hot 
Scurvy. 

Such Constitutions ought to avoid 
alkaline Substances, mentioned No 4, 
viz. an animal Diet, especially Fat, 
Spices, and all Vegetables which a-
bound with an acrimonious Salt and 
high exalted Oil, and the copious 
use of Salts in general; all animal 
Salts are alkaline; Sea-Salt and Rock-
Salt, tho' they are of a mix'd Na-
ture, rather increase the Disease; Salt-
Petre is the most cooling and pro-
per. 

|P_292
They ought to use plentifully the 
acid Substances mentioned No 15, to 
live much upon Aliments made of 
Grains or mealy Substances, to eat 
much Bread, and season much with 
Vinegar; thin Wines, Wine mix'd 
with Water, Water with Juice of 
Limon, and especially Milk and Wa-
ter, are proper Drinks. 

Those who feel no Inconvenience 
in taking Acids, ought to take them 
plentifully. 

People of such Constitutions ought 
not to use violent Exercise, nor long 
Abstinence, which disposeth to such 
a State, and after long Abstinence 
they ought not to eat plentifully; 
they ought to use liquid rather than 
solid Aliment. 

Plethorick Constitutions are sub-
ject to fall into this alkaline State of 
the Fluids, which is more dangerous 
than that which proceeds from Aci-
dity, for the Bile (which is here re-
dundant) is the strongest Anti-acid, 
|P_293
and when it is highly exalted, and 
acrimonious, is capable of producing 
all the dreadful Symptoms of malig-
nant and pestilential Fevers, as is 
evident from the Experiments that 
were made in the Plague of Mar-
seilles. There is nothing corrects the 
Acrimony of the Bile so much as the 
acid Diet above-mentioned; therefore 
one cannot be too early and quick in 
discerning a Tendency to such a State, 
and observing if the Person be ple-
thorick, hot, or dry; if the Air be hot; 
if bilious Fevers reign; if there be 
any Acrimony in the Fæces, Urine, 
Sweat; or a yellow; Cast in the Skin; 
with the Signs above-mentioned, by 
an early Application of proper Reme-
dies, many dangerous and fatal Di-
seases might be prevented. 

[}Phlegmatick Constitutions. }]
Sickness of the Stomach, a Sense 
of Fulness without eating; Crudities 
|P_294
or Meat remaining in the Stomach 
undigested, Dejection of Appetite, 
Wind coming upwards, but especial-
ly tough Phlegm frequently rejected 
by Vomiting, Inflations and Tu-
mors of the Belly (sometimes short 
Breath) and Paleness, are Signs of a 
phlegmatick Constitution; when a 
Child grows pale, and his Belly swells, 
as happens to those that are rickety, 
there is certainly tough Phlegm in 
the Intestines, which commonly shuts 
up the Mouths of the Lacteals, and 
hinders the Nourishment from pas-
sing: Persons of such Constitutions 
ought to avoid mealy Substances un-
fermented, unripe Fruits, and all 
viscous Nourishment; they ought not 
to let Blood, except upon urgent 
Occasions, nor provoke Sweat, which 
thickens the Humours. 

Their Diet ought to be alkalescent, 
of Substances mentioned No 4, be-
cause whatever brings them into an 
alkaline State, is a proper Cure for 
|P_295
the Disease; therefore soapy Sub-
stances, which consist of a pungent 
Salt and volatile Oil, Spices, Salt, 
Garlick, Onions, Leeks, and the 
warm Vegetables us'd in Seasoning, 
Thyme, Rosemary, Savory, Basil, 
Marjoram, and in general, every 
thing which exalts the Bile; for bi-
lious and phlegmatick Constitutions 
are opposite; and even Children so 
diseas'd ought to use a warmer Diet, 
than what seems proper to their Age 
without it. 

Phlegmatick Persons ought to drink 
fermented Liquors and generous 
Wines, such as put the Blood in a 
vigorous Motion. Warm Water dis-
solves Phlegm, but it relaxeth too 
much. 

[}Thickness of Blood. }]
Thirst, Leanness, Excess of ani-
mal Secretions, as of Urine, Sweat, 
liquid Dejections, too strong a Per-
|P_296
spiration, are Signs and Effects of 
too great Thinness of Blood. 

For such, the Diet prescrib'd in 
Debility or Weakness of Fibres, is 
useful; Milk boil'd with Grains, es-
pecially Rice, rather solid than liquid 
Aliment, and austere Wines for 
Drink. 

[}Oily or fat Constitutions. }]
Fat People ought to eat and sleep 
little, and use much Exercise, in 
which the Cure chiefly consists. 

Whatever heats moderately, sti-
mulating Substances abounding with 
a pungent acrid Salt, as Mustard, 
Horse-Radishes, Garlicks, Onions, 
Leeks, Spices, and the aromatick 
Plants us'd in Seasoning, Saffron, 
carminative Seeds, Meats high sea-
son'd with Salt, Pepper and Vinegar, 
are all proper, and dissolve Fat; they 
have only one Inconvenience, that 
they create Thirst, and great Quan-
|P_297
tities of Liquids increase the Disease, 
by diluting and relaxing the Solids; 
Salt is a great Dissolver of Fat. 

Fat People ought to avoid oily 
Nourishment; but Soaps, which con-
sist of Oil and Salt, are proper, be-
cause they are resolvent; therefore 
Honey, Sugar, and ripe Garden-Fruits 
are useful. 

Some of the astringent Substances, 
mentioned No 1, are useful, because 
their Fibres are commonly too lax. 

Whatever promotes Perspiration, 
and therefore Frictions of the Skin, 
are useful. 

Their Drink ought to be thin 
Wines; Coffee and Tea, as they di-
lute and stimulate moderately, are 
useful; great Quantities of oily fer-
mented Liquors increase Fat; mere 
Water relaxeth too much; moist Air 
is hurtful to fat People, by relaxing 
the Fibres, and stopping Perspira-
tion. 

|P_298
[}Melancholy or atrabilarian Constitutions. }]
A Tendency to this is known by 
Darkness or Lividity of Countenance, 
Dryness of the Skin, Leanness, a 
quick penetrating Genius, a slow 
Pulse, and Respiration, Obstruction 
of the Belly, and too great Applica-
tion to one Object. 

To such, all things which heat 
and promote too great a Perspiration, 
as all Substances that abound with an 
acrimonious Salt and volatile Oil, 
are hurtful, which the Reader may 
see in the First Chapter. Nourish-
ment viscous and hard of Digestion, 
and nothing more than salted and 
smok'd Flesh or Fish; in general, 
every thing that thickens the Fluids, 
or reduceth them to a pitchy Con-
dition. 

Astringent austere Aliment, men-
tion'd No 1, and austere Wines, are 
hurtful. 

|P_299
Too cold and too hot Air are both 
hurtful, for in such States of Air, 
melancholy Persons are always worst. 

Diluting is beneficial, especial-
ly with Water impregnated with 
some penetrating Salt, Substances 
which cool, relax the Belly, and 
resolve the Bile; Barley-Water, 
Whey, ripe Garden Fruits, emollient 
Pot-Herbs, especially Lettuce, Ci-
chory, Dandelion, and Honey most 
of all. 

There is one Caution to be ob-
serv'd, That the Diet ought to be 
opposite to the particular Acrimony 
which occasions the Disease; for if 
it proceeds from too great Acidity, 
in such a Case an animal Diet, 
Broths made of Flesh-Meat, and 
even Eggs, are proper; if the Cause 
be alkaline, the contrary Method is 
useful. 

|P_300
[}Faulty Motion of the Fluids. }]
The Blood and other Fluids of a 
Human Body, are often not only 
peccant in their Qualities, but Mo-
tion, which may be either too flow, 
too quick, or in some of the Vessels 
totally obstructed. 

Those who have too slow a Circu-
lation, are to be consider'd, as in the 
Case of phlegmatick and fat People; 
and those who have too quick a 
Circulation are to be consider'd, as 
in the Case of such as are bilious, 
hot, and alkaline; and the respective 
Diets are proper. 

In Obstructions of the Vessels in-
flammatory, the Aliment ought to 
be cool, slender, thin, diluting, a-
voiding the copious use of Substan-
ces of a saline Quality, which sti-
mulate, and consequently may in-
crease the Inflammations, unless in 
some Cases where there is hopes by 
|P_301
volatile Salts to attenuate the Fluid, 
and remove the Obstruction, or 
where the Intention is to produce a 
Suppuration; but it is certain that 
any stimulating Substance, when it 
does not remove the Obstruction, 
increaseth the Inflammation. 

In cold Tumors, where the In-
tention is to dissipate and attenuate, 
the Diet ought to be diluting and 
stimulating, consisting of such Sub-
stances as are of a soapy Nature, that 
is, of Salt and Oil. 

[}Wounds. }]
The Aliment of such as have fresh 
Wounds ought to be mild, that is, 
without stimulating or saline Sub-
stances, of easy Digestion, of such 
sort as keeps the Humours from Pu-
trefaction, and renders them oily and 
balsamick. 

When a Suppuration is to be pro-
moted, the Aliment ought to be 
|P_302
more copious and warm, because 
such induceth a Putrefaction. 

When a Sore is healing, the Pa-
tient is in some measure in the Case 
of an Infant that is growing, whose 
Aliment ought to be such as lengthens 
the Fibres without Rupture, for it is 
by such an Elongation of the Fibres 
that Sores heal; and indeed the Chi-
rurgeon ought to vary the Diet of 
his Patient as he finds the Fibres 
lengthen too much, are too flaccid 
and produce Fungus's, or as they 
harden and produce Callosities; in 
the first Case Wine and spirituous 
Liquors are useful, in the last hurt-
ful. 

Women in Childbed are in the 
Case of Persons wounded. 

|P_303
[}CHAP. III. }]
[}Of Acute Diseases. }]
[}Fevers, with their various Symptoms. }]
RIGOR, Coldness. A right Regi-
men during the Rigor or cold 
Fit in the beginning of a Fever, is 
of great Importance, and Mistakes 
of dangerous Consequence: A long 
continued Rigor is a Sign of a 
strong Disease, and is in it self an. 
Approach towards Death; during 
the Rigor, the Circulation is less 
quick, and the Blood actually stag-
nates in the Extremities, and pres-
sing upon the Heart creates great 
Anxieties, and may produce Con-
cretions about the Heart, and in 
other Parts of the Body; therefore a 
Rigor increaseth an Inflammation. 
Those who die of Quartan Fevers, 
die in the cold Fit; and indeed there 
|P_304
is no Mischief but what may pro-
ceed from a Rigor of long Dura-
tion. 

In such Rigors, all warm Cordials 
and stimulating Substances are im-
proper, for the first acting with 
force upon the right Ventricle of the 
Heart, may drive the Blood with 
too much Force through the Lungs; 
and stimulating Substances, by con-
stringing the Vessels, often increase 
the Symptom. 

In such a Rigor, nothing is more 
proper than Water, which dilutes and 
relaxes at the same time, and will 
sooner terminate the cold Fit, and 
throw the Patient into a Sweat, than 
the warmest Cordial; if a very small 
Quantity of Rhenish Wine be mix'd 
with the Water, it will be still more 
effectual: In this Case strong Fric-
tions of the Extremities relieve. 

Anxieties. In Anxieties which at-
tend Fevers, when the cold Fit is 
over, a warmer Regimen may be 
|P_305
allow'd; and because Anxieties often 
happen by Spasms from Wind, Spices 
are useful. 

In those Anxieties, Soapy Sub-
stances which dissolve the Blood, are 
indicated; ripe Fruits; some of the 
lactescent Plants, as Lettuce, Endive, 
&c. and especially Honey, have this 
Quality. 

Thirst. In Thirst attending Fevers, 
Liquors should not be drank quite 
cold; for cold Liquors, by constring-
ing the Glands of the Palate and 
Throat, do not quench Thirst so 
well as Liquors moderately warm: 
In this Case subacid Liquors should be 
drank plentifully; all Salts increase 
Thirst, except Nitre, and dulcify'd Spi-
rit of Nitre mix'd with Water, is very 
proper in this Case; so are Barley-
Water and Emulsions, except in great 
Weakness and Flatulencies of the Sto-
mach, in which Case Water mix'd 
with a small Quantity of Rhenish 
Wine, is best of all. 

|P_306

Sickness, Vomiting. This is one of 
the most troublesome Symptoms at-
tending a Fever, because it renders 
the Patient incapable of taking any 
thing. 

This Symptom is often prevented 
by giving a Vomit; or cur'd by pro-
moting the Vomiting for a while by 
tepid Water. 

During the Symptom, acid Li-
quors, and ev'n such as are austere 
and astringent, are indicated, because 
such strengthen the Fibres of the 
Stomach; and indeed Nature directs 
Patients to such a Diet, for they co-
vet subacid Liquors, and abhor fat 
and oily things. 

Diluting, and sometimes relaxing 
the Belly, and carrying the bilious 
Salts downwards, often cures this 
Symptom. 

Attention is to be given to the 
Appetites of Patients, in this and 
many other Cases, who have some-
times coveted odd things which 
|P_307
have reliev'd them, as Salt, Vine-
gar, &c.

Vomiting, from a bilious Cause, 
is cur'd by subacid Liquors; Vomit-
ing, from some putrid Cause, by 
Salts of all Kinds; in such a Case, 
Water-Gruel with Cream of Tartar, 
Rhenish Wine and Water, Jelly of 
Currants, Marmalade of Quinces, 
Sorrel boil'd in Broths well skimm'd 
from Fat, are beneficial. 

If the Vomiting comes from a 
phlegmatick Cause, Spices, and bit-
ter things will relieve. The Counter-
poison must be adapted to the Cause; 
for Example, in Poison from Subli-
mated Corrosive, and Arsenick. 

In the First, alkaline Substances; 
in the Second, oily Substances are 
proper; in both, diluent. 

It is easy to judge of the Cause by 
the Substances which the Patient 
throws up. 

|P_308

Whether Vomit may be safely 
or properly given, must be judg'd 
by the Circumstances; if there be 
any Symptoms of an Inflammation 
of the Stomach, a Vomit is ex-
tremely dangerous. 

Wind and Spasms are occasion'd by 
the feverish Heat expanding the ae-
rial Particles in the Fluids. 

Whatever is anodyne and quiets 
Convulsions, and what abates the 
Heat, relieves this Symptom. 

Weakness, or the Impotence of ex-
ercising animal Motion which attends 
Fevers, proceeds from too great Ful-
ness in the beginning, and too great 
Inanition in the latter end of the 
Disease; for whatever stops or re-
tards the Circulation in the smallest 
Vessels, especially those of the Brain 
(which either of these Causes will do) 
produceth this Symptom. Those 
two Causes demand different Me-
thods, in the first emptying and dilu-
|P_309
ting; in the latter, a more plentiful 
Nourishment, the use of Wine dilu-
ted with Water, and Spices in small 
Quantities, Jellies, Broths, the alka-
lescent Quality of which may be cor-
rected with some acid, unless there 
be Signs of Acidity, and in that Case 
the Diet ought to be contrary to the 
Cause of the Symptom; Viper-
Broth is both anti-acid and nourishing. 

In Debility, from great Loss of 
Blood, Wine, and all Aliment that 
is easily assimulated, or turn'd into 
Blood, is proper; Blood is required 
to make Blood; a small Quantity of 
Blood brings the Patient into danger 
of a Dropsy. 

Frictions of the extreme Parts re-
lieve Weaknesses, as they promote 
the Flux of the Juices and Spirits in 
the Joints and Limbs. 

Fat People are most subject to this 
Symptom of Weakness in Fevers, 
because the Fat, melted by the fever-
ish Heat, obstructs the small Canals, 
|P_310
and consequently produceth this 
Symptom. This is evident by the 
great Loss of Fat such People sustain 
in Fevers. In the latter end of Fe-
vers, such are weak by the Laxity of 
the Fibres, and the Emptiness of the 
smaller Vessels; such therefore must 
be treated with particular Care, viz,
after due Evacuations, diluting 
strongly both by Drink and Clysters, 
avoiding all things oily, and using 
Sugar, Honey, and ripe Fruits. 

Cordials made of spirituous Li-
quors are not the best Remedies for 
this Debility, tho' they increase the 
Force of the Heart, and are necessa-
ry sometimes to keep up the vital 
Functions, they rather coagulate the 
Fluid; they add Strength to the Mill, 
but congeal the Stream. Whatever 
makes the Circulation more free 
through the small Vessels, is a Cor-
dial. 

Heat; the Degree of which may 
be known by the Thermoscope, the 
|P_311
Sensation of the Patient, the Intense-
ness of the red Colour of the Urine, 
the Sizeness of the Blood, the Dissi-
pation of the fluid Parts, which 
renders it thicker; the Hardness, 
Strength, and Frequency of the 
Pulse, which makes the Friction the 
stronger, to which the Heat is pro-
portional, the bad Disposition of the 
Humour, and the dry Temperament 
of the Body. 

Feverish Heat is moderated by 
Blood-letting, by muscular Rest, by 
moderate Ligatures which compress the 
Veins only, and often removed from 
Joint to Joint, by a mechanical Rea-
son, retard the Circulation; of such 
sort is dry Cupping, bathing the 
lower Parts, watery Liquors for Drink, 
not cold, but tepid; subacid, as Jel-
ly of Currants dissolved in tepid wa-
tery Liquors; Decoctions of mealy 
Substances acidulated, Substances a-
nodyne, Substances which dissolve 
Concretions, as Sugar, Honey, and 
|P_312
the simple Oxymel, often used by 
Hippocrates, plentiful diluting, and 
restoring as much Water to the Blood 
as is dissipated by the Heat; all de-
mulcent and relaxing Substances, 
cooling the Air in the Room, open-
ing the Curtains, and removing too 
thick Bed-clothes; all stimulating and 
slyptick Substances to be avoided, be-
cause they increase the Force of the 
solid Parts. 

Delirium. Too great Alacrity and 
Promptness in Answering, especially in 
Persons naturally of another Tem-
per, is a Sign of an approaching De-
lirium: In a feverish Delirium there 
is a small Inflammation of the Brain; 
therefore any thing which increaseth 
the Circulation in the lower Parts, 
and diminisheth the Pressure on the 
Brain, is beneficial, as immerging 
the Feet in warm Water; nothing 
relieves the Head more than the 
Piles, therefore Suppositories of Ho-
ney, Aloes, and Rock-Salt, ought 
|P_313
to be try'd, relaxing by emollient 
and watery Substances, both in 
Drink and Clysters, especially Bar-
ley-Cream and Barley-Gruel. 

Coma Sleepiness. A Coma will 
proceed either from a Pressure upon 
the Originals of the Nerves, by 
too great Repletion; or from a 
Penury of Spirits by too great Ina-
nition. 

Old Men are subject to Comas by 
the Tenacity of the Fluids circula-
ting in the Brain, which being re-
solved by the Fever, obstruct the 
small Canals of the Brain: In young 
People it commonly proceeds from 
Fulness, and is best cur'd by letting 
Blood, and relaxing the Belly. The 
Sign of such a Fulness is, a red 
Countenance, and Eyes inflamed; 
if it proceeds from a glutinous Oil, it 
ought to be attempted to be resolv'd 
by Water, nitrous Salts, Soaps, and 
subacid Liquors. 


|P_314 People recovering from Comas, 
must take at first soft Nourishment, 
and in small Quantities. 

Watchfulness. This Symptom, 
which is sometimes call'd a Coma 
Vigil, often precedes too great Sleepi-
ness, and is perhaps the most ill-bo-
ding Symptom of a Fever. 

The Expedients in such a Case 
are extreme Care to keep the Pa-
tient from Noise, and what makes 
any strong Impression upon his Senses, 
some of those Helps us'd in a Deli-
rium, because this is an Approach to-
wards it; a moist softening Diet; all 
Preparations of Barley, Emulsions of 
Poppy Seeds, and Almonds, Ali-
ment of some lactescent Plants, espe-
cially Lettuces, Decoctions of Scor-
zonera Roots, Almond Cream, and 
what is call'd Winter Flummery, 
us'd as Aliment; Tea, made of 
Cowslip Flowers, relaxing gently the 
Belly. 

|P_315

Boerhaave proposes some mecha-
nical Expedients which may perhaps 
have a good Effect, as a soft Noise 
of Water distilling by Drops into a 
Bason, and the Patient trying to 
reckon them. 

The Air perfum'd with the Smell 
of soporiferous Plants, as Poppies, 
Mandrakes, Nightshade, Bean Flow-
ers. 

Application of Cloths dipp'd in 
Vinegar to the Temples. 

Opiats must never be given but 
after great Evacuations. 

Convulsions. It is of the utmost 
Importance to know the Cause and 
the Seat of this Disease, which is of-
ten obscure. 

In Infants they commonly pro-
ceed from Acidity in the Stomach, 
and are cured by terrestrial Absor-
bents; in such indeed Convulsions 
attending Fevers are not quite so 
dangerous. 

|P_316

Convulsions arising from some 
Acrimony in the Stomach, or from 
something vellicating a Nerve in its 
Extremity, and not in its Original 
where it ariseth from the Brain, are not 
very dangerous. 

Convulsions which arise from great 
Evacuations, as great Hæmorrages 
attending Fevers, are dangerous. 

Convulsions arising from Inflam-
mations of the Membranes of the 
Brain are commonly fatal: The 
Symptoms attending them are a 
great Heat, a hard Pulse, and a De-
lirium: The Remedies, and even 
those from Diet, are to be us'd ac-
cording to the Seat of the Disease. 

If from the Stomach, such Ali-
ments as are contrary to the par-
ticular Acrimony, Acid Alkaline, or 
Oily, residing there, as in the Case 
of Vomiting. 

If from something impacted in 
the Brain, warm volatile and spicy 
Substances will increase the Disease; 
|P_317
in that Case, Substances which re-
lax and dilute are proper, especially 
such as open the Belly; which, See 
in the First Chapter; and in general, 
the Regimen prescrib'd in a Coma, 
or Delirium. 

Violent Sweats proceed from a 
Laxity of the Vessels, and too vehe-
ment a Circulation of the Blood. 

Profuse Sweats deprive the Blood 
of its most fluid Parts, thicken, and 
often cause Obstructions; it is not
 good Practice to push Sweating 
too much in Fevers, except in such as 
are pestilential. 

In profuse Sweats, Care at least 
should be taken, by diluting, to re-
store the Liquid which the Blood 
loseth, and to use the Methods ad-
vised in too great Heat, by taking 
away some of the Coverings of the 
Bed, and admitting of cool Air, 
and using a Diet moderately astrin-
gent; Wine, Spices, and spirituous 
Liquors, in this Case, have often a 
|P_318
good Effect; spirituous Liquors thick-
en the Fluids; Sage is a good Re-
medy in the Case of profuse Sweats. 

A Diarrhœa Looseness proves often a 
dangerous and fatal Symptom in Fe-
vers, it weakens, excoriates and inflames 
the Bowels, occasions Bloody-Fluxes, 
thickens the circulating Juices, and 
exhausts the Strength of the Patient; 
notwithstanding, a critical Diarrhœa 
is not to be stopt, for fear of in-
curring these Dangers. 

Attention is to be given to the 
Cause of Acidity; it is to be cur'd 
by Anti-acids; but, as in Fevers, the 
Cause is more frequently alkaline and 
bilious, Acid or four things resolve, 
and it happens that oily Substances 
by blasting the Acrimony will do 
good in Diarrhœas. Oily Substances 
of themselves do not irritate or pro-
voke Diarrhœas, they only lubricate 
or make the Bowels slippery. Diarr-
hœas arising from Quantities of Fruit 
are often cur'd by Emulsions. 

|P_319
Vomiting, by evacuating the irri-
tating Cause, often cures such Diar-
rhœas. 

Anodyne Substances are proper, 
and generally speaking, solid and dry 
Aliment, rather than liquid. 

Inflammatory Eruptions. In all 
these of any kind whatsoever, as 
Small-Pox, Meazles, Scarlet Fever, 
Purples, the Intention in Diet 
ought to be, to avoid strong Sudo-
rificks, which push out too great a 
Quantity of the Matter upon the 
Skin; to use cooling and temperate 
Diluents, which keep the Matter flu-
id and moveable, so that it may be 
secern'd from the Blood; to keep 
warm during the Eruption; and that 
then Diet be cool; for which Reason 
the moderate Use of Acids, as Juice 
of Limon, is indicated. 

A due Attention to the few Rules 
above-mention'd, in the several Symp-
toms, will prove very successful in 
the Cure of most Fevers. I shall 
|P_320
only add a few more according to 
the various Kinds of Fevers and In-
flammatory Distempers. 

An Ephemera, or a Fever of one 
Day, is cur'd by Abstinence, Rest, 
and Diluting; and the same Method 
will prove effectual if the Fever lasts se-
veral Days, and is not putrid, or attend-
ed with a greater Inflammation and 
Acrimony, and Obstruction of the 
Vessels in some Parts of the Body, 
amongst which is what is commonly 
call'd, a Causus, or burning Fever. 

The Causes of such a Fever are 
various; Errors in the Non-Naturals, 
Air, Meat and Drink, Rest and Mo-
tion. Such a Fever will be rais'd by 
Vehement Exercise or Labour, Heat 
of the Sun, by long Thirst, by the 
immoderate Use of fermented and 
spirituous Liquors; and hot things, 
as Spices; and by great Lassitude en-
dured any way, especially in hot 
Weather. 

|P_321

Its Symptoms are a burning Heat 
in the Skin, a Sensation of extreme 
Heat inwardly; sometimes Coldness 
in the extreme Parts; Dryness of 
the Skin, Mouth, and Nostrils; 
a Dryness and Roughness of the 
Tongue; laborious and short breath-
ing; great Thirst; Loathing, Sick-
ness of the Stomach, and Vomiting; 
Anxiety, Restlesness, Weariness; some-
times a Cough and Hoarseness; Watch-
fulness and Delirium, and Exacerba-
tion every other Day. 

Such a Fever is often resolv'd by 
a bleeding at the Nose, which ought 
not to be stop'd unless it endangers 
Life. It is likewise often in the cri-
tical Day resolv'd by Sweating, Vo-
miting, Looseness, and Spitting of 
thick Phlegm. The fatal Signs are 
commonly bloody Urine, Difficulty 
of Swallowing, watery Sweats about 
the Head and Face, without Relief; 
Coldness of the Extremities, Trem-
bling, too great a Looseness; and 
|P_322
sometimes an Inflammation of the 
Lungs. 

The Regimen, in such a Fever, is 
keeping the Air of the Room pure 
and cool, untainted with Fire, Smoke, 
or the Breaths of many People; they 
ought to have no more Bed-clothes 
than barely protects them from Cold; 
their Curtains ought to be kept open 
so as to renew the Air; and their 
Posture in lying, as erect as they 
can bear; the Sick, in this Condition, 
covet all these things, and their Con-
traries offend them. 

Their Drink ought to be cool, mild, 
subacid, tepid, given in moderate 
Quantities, and often, as Water 
with Juice of Limon or Tama-
rinds. 

Their Aliment ought to be light, 
of farinaceous Vegetables, as Water-
Gruel, Preparations of Barley, with 
some Juice of Limon; Rice boil'd in 
Whey, and strain'd. Roasted Apples 
in the Progress of the Disease; a lit-
tle
|P_323
toasted Bread with Rhenish Wine 
and Water, Jelly of Currants; Broths 
and Jellies made of animal Substances 
are rather too alkalescent, at least they 
ought to be qualify'd with Juices of 
Limon, or some acid. 

Sometimes such alimentary Sub-
stances as gently stimulate the Belly, 
are useful, as some ripe Fruits, Straw-
berries, Currants, Mulberries. 

The Symptoms increase by the 
Use of hot things given either as Ali-
ment or Medicine. 

[}Intermitting Fevers. }]
They are (at least in this Country) 
very obstinate, often return in spite 
of all Remedies, and by long Con-
tinuance they degenerate into Hepa-
tical Fevers, and many chronical Dis-
tempers, as Jaundice, Dropsy, Schir-
rus's, and Scurvies; therefore in this 
Disease a right Method, both of Me-
dicines and Diet, is of great Impor-
|P_324
tance. There is a great Variety in 
these Diseases, as to the Intervals of 
Times between the Paroxysms; Ter-
tians sometimes redouble their Paro-
xysms, so as to appear like Quotidians. 
I think it may be taken as a general 
Rule, That the greater Distance of 
Time there is between the Paroxysms, 
the Fever is less dangerous, but more 
obstinate. 

There is a different Regimen to 
be us'd during the Continuance and 
Absence of the Paroxysm; and in the 
Paroxysm itself, during the Rigor or 
cold Fit, the Heat and the Sweat. 

During the Rigor, the Regimen 
prescrib'd in the foregoing Part of 
this Chapter, in the Article of Fever-
ish Rigors, is proper in all Fevers, 
and Care is to be taken by all pro-
per Methods to shorten that Period as 
much as possible, and by tepid Di-
luents to bring on the Sweat soon, 
but not to push it beyond its due 
Measure, because an intermitting Fe-
|P_325
ver relaxeth and weakens the Body 
extremely. 

Between the Paroxysms, too great 
Abstinence is hurtful as much as too 
great Repletion; as intermitting Fe-
vers are often of long Continuance, 
extreme Abstinence is impractica-
ble, and would reduce the Pa-
tient to a Condition not to be able 
to sustain the Shock of the next At-
tack. 

Between the Paroxysms, such Sub-
stances as temper, correct, and sub-
due the bilious Alkali, as acid Sub-
stances, nitrous Salts, small thin 
Wines with Water, Chicken Broth with 
Juice of Limons; Wine with Bitters 
infused, are proper; Cichory and 
Dandelion are useful, because the ex-
press'd Juices of them cure intermit-
ting Fevers in warm Countries; the 
Physicians of these Countries likewise 
use astringent Vegetables, See Chap. I. 
No 1. 

|P_326

Exercise, to as great a degree as 
the Patient can bear, is extremely 
beneficial between the Paroxysms. 

But the chief Remedy of all is to 
endeavour to prevent the cold Fit, 
by getting to Bed, by Frictions, and 
some sudorifick and warm Liquor; 
for by putting off the cold Fit some 
Agues have been cur'd. 

Letting of Blood seldom does 
good, and often a great deal of Hurt 
in intermitting Fevers; but the Con-
dition of the Patient is to be consi-
der'd in this Case. 

Intermitting Fevers have been ob-
served to free from some Chronical 
Distempers, as the Gout and Con-
vulsions, but they often induce great 
ones themselves. 

|P_327
[}INFLAMMATORY DISEASES. }]
[}A Phrensy, or Inflammation of the Brain. }]
This Disease, of all others, re-
quires the speediest Applications, 
profuse Hæmorrages from the Nose 
commonly resolve it, and copious 
Bleeding, by opening the temporal 
Arteries, are the most effectual Re-
medies: But to stick to my Subject, 
which is the Diet. 

Substances which cool, and at the 
same time relax the Belly, are highly 
beneficial, as Tamarinds boil'd in 
Water, which taken plentifully may 
at last bring a Looseness which is a 
great Relief to the Head. 

Soliciting the Blood to other Parts 
of the Body; therefore tepid Bathings 
of the lower Parts, and procuring the 
Piles, relaxing Fomentations apply'd 
to the Veins, which carry the Blood 
from the Head, relieve in this Di-
|P_328
sease. Cool Air, and Sitting up, if 
possible; for the warm Air of the 
Bed exagitates the Blood. 

The Aliment ought to be slender, 
of farinaceous Substances, as Water-
Gruel acidulated, or subacid ripe 
Fruits, with their Jellies; the Drink 
small, diluting, and cooling, Barley-
Water, Small-Beer, or the Decoction 
of Tamarinds above-mentioned. All 
such gentle Anodynes as are to be 
found amongst the Alimentary Kind, 
are safe. See the Articles of Deli-
rium and Watchfulness in this Chap-
ter. 

[}Quincy. }]
The Tumour of the Throat, which 
occasions the Difficulty of Swallowing 
and Breathing, attending this Dis-
temper, may be of various sorts: 
Sometimes it proceeds from a Serosi-
ty obstructing the Glands, which 
may be watery, ædematose, schirrous, 
|P_329
according to the several degrees of 
the Viscosity of the Humour; some-
time inflammatory, which Inflamma-
tion will sometimes end in a Suppu-
ration, or Gangrene. 

The Difficulties of Breathing and 
Swallowing, which happen without 
any Tumour outward or inward, af-
ter long Diseases, proceed commonly 
from a Resolution or paralytical Dis-
position of the Parts, and is the im-
mediate Forerunner of Death. 

The Regimen in those Quincies 
which proceed merely from the Ob-
struction of the Glands, must be to 
use such warm Liquors as gently re-
lax, soften, and moisten those Glands, 
such as carry off the redundant Se-
rum by Stool, Sweat, and Urine; or 
by stimulating, open the Emuncto-
ries of these Glands to secern the 
Humour[/1./]. 

|P_330

In a more watery Tumour, the 
Diet may be more warm than in the 
inflammatory, and the moderate use 
of Wine often relieves the Patient. 

The Difficulty of Swallowing and 
Breathing, occasion'd by Schirrosities 
of the Glands, is not to be cur'd any 
otherwise than by Extirpation. 

Those who are subject to Inflam-
mations of the Throat, ought to live 
temperately to prevent a Plethora; or 
to break such a Fulness speedily by 
proper Evacuations, to beware of 
cold Air, too astringent or stimula-
ting Aliment or Medicine, and vio-
lent Exercise, which, by increasing 
the projectile Motion of the Blood, 
heat; but especially the swallowing of 
cold Liquors when they are hot. 

In these Inflammations a slight Di-
arrhœa relieves; therefore Aliments 
which promote it are useful, as Ta-
marinds infus'd in Whey. Decoc-
tions and Emulsions of farinaceous 
|P_331
Vegetables moderately acidulated, and 
such as abound with a cooling ni-
trous Salt, are proper; it is com-
monly thought that Punpenella, Saxi-
fraga, or Burnet, is a Specifick in 
this Case: Every body knows the Be-
nefit of Mulberries, taken all man-
ner of ways. All Acids, as Sorrel, 
Juice of Limon, &c. abate Inflam-
mations. 

The Mouth and Throat must be 
kept moist, and the Nose clear, that 
the Air may have a free Passage 
through it; for Air drawn by the 
Mouth, dries. 

When the Deglutition is totally 
abolish'd, the Patient may be nou-
rish'd by Clysters, which I have 
known to have been done for a 
whole Week, after which the Tumour 
suppurated. 

When the Inflammation ends in 
a Gangrene, the Case generally proves 
mortal, except it be only in the 
Tonsils, Uvula, and Palate, and go no 
|P_332
further, which Parts may be separated, 
and the Patient live. 

[}Inflammation of the Lungs. }]
Such may happen either in the 
bronchial or pulmonary Vessels, and
may soon be communicated from 
one to the other; when the Inflam-
mation affects both the Lobes and the 
whole Body of the Lungs, the Case 
is desperate, because the Circulation 
must be stopt, and no Blood can 
flow back into the Heart. Besides 
the general Causes of Inflammations, 
those which affect the Lungs particu-
larly, are a bad Conformation of the 
Lungs and Thorax commonly atten-
ded with an Asthma, Air too hot, 
cold and moist, abounding perhaps 
with caustick, astringent, and coa-
gulating Particles; the Lungs, pro-
perly speaking, are an outward Part of 
the Body, expos'd to the Air, which, 
by its immediate Contact may easily 
|P_333
coagulate the Blood which flows a-
long the Surfaces of the Air-Bladders, 
and I believe the Qualities of the 
Air are the general Cause of the In-
flammation of the Lungs which hap-
pen in the Winter time. 

As the Lungs are the chief Organ 
of Sanguification, crude and viscous 
Chyle, viscous Aliment, Spices, but 
especially spirituous Liquors, may oc-
casion this Inflammation; too great 
an Exercise of the Lungs, so as to 
occasion a short and laborious Breath-
ing, or keeping them too long upon 
the Stretch by Vociferation, or loud 
Singing, may produce the same Ef-
fect: There are coagulating Poisons 
which affect the Lungs very suddenly; 
extreme violent Passions, by affecting 
the Motion of the Heart, may do 
the same; it is a common thing to 
see People in sudden Transports of 
Anger breathe short. Inflammations 
are sometimes translated from other 
Parts to the Lungs; a Pleurisy easily 
|P_334
passeth into Peripneumony. The a-
voiding those Causes is the best Rule 
of Diet to prevent the Disease; be-
sides, speedy and plentiful letting of 
Blood before it has quite taken 
place. 

This Disease is often cur'd by the 
critical Resolution, Concoction, and 
Evacuation of the morbifick Matter, 
which is either attenuated so as to 
be return'd into the Channels, and 
to go on in the common. Thread 
of Circulation, or expectorated by 
Coughing, which may be easily 
known by the Abatement of Symp-
toms, viz. the Fever, Difficulty of 
Breathing, Thirst, Anxiety, Restles-
ness, and the Patient's falling into 
gentle breathing Sweats. One of the 
best Resolvents is the Blood of the 
wild Goat. 

Copious Bleeding is the most ef-
fectual Remedy in the beginning of 
the Disease; but when the Expecto-
ration goes on successfully, not so 
|P_335
proper, because it sometimes suppres-
seth it, and in that Case Sudorificks 
thicken the Matter that is expectora-
ted. The Motions of Nature ought 
to be followed. This by the way. 

From the Symptoms in this Stage 
of the Disease, and the use of the 
Lungs, it is evident the Aliment 
ought to be more slender and thin 
than in any other inflammatory Di-
sease whatsoever, common Whey be-
ing sufficient to preserve the Strength 
of the Patient; watery Liquors, and 
even the Steam of warm Water ta-
ken in by the Breath, attenuates the 
impacted Matter. Relaxing Ali-
ment, of which Barley and all its 
Preparations are the best. 

In this State, Diureticks, which 
have not much Acrimony in them, 
are proper, for Fluxes of Urine re-
lieve the Lungs; for this Intention, 
an Infusion of Fenel Roots in warm 
Water, with Milk, is good, both as 
Nourishment and Drinks. 

|P_336

If Nature relieves by a Diarrhœa, 
without sinking the Strength of the 
Patient, it is not to be stopt, but 
promoted gently by emollient Cly-
sters. 

Decoction of Cichory, Lettuce, 
as being anodyne and resolvent, are 
proper. 

If the Patient is not reliev'd nor 
dies in eight Days, the Inflammation 
ends in a Suppuration and an Abscess 
in the Lungs, and sometimes in some 
other Part of the Body; the Symptoms 
of which are, an obstinate dry Cough, 
increas'd by Motion and taking of 
Food; theeasiest Posture in Lying be-
ing upon the affected Side; a continual 
Lent-Fever, with Rigors invading with 
uncertain Periods; Exacerbations af-
ter Motion and Repast, Thirst, Night-
Sweats, a frothy Urine, Paleness, 
Leanness, Weakness. 

In such a Case one must forbear 
letting of Blood. The Diet must 
be mild, soft, incrassating, and more 
|P_337
plentiful; tepid Vapours admitted 
into the Lungs, of Decoctions of 
proper Ingredients; and when by the 
Symptoms and Time the Impost-
hume may be judg'd to be ripe, the 
Vapour of Vinegar it self, and any 
thing which creates a Cough, as 
Oxymel, or Vinegar and Honey, 
Exercise and Concussion are proper, 
the sooner it is broke, the less Dan-
ger to the Lungs. 

Tho' such a State is extremely dan-
gerous, it is not quite desperate; the 
Aliment ought to be Milk; the 
Drink, Milk, and Barley-Water, and 
such alimentary Substances as are ex-
pectorating and cleansing, with gen-
tle Anodynes, that the Patient may 
have some Rest. See Chap I. 

The principal Intention in every 
State of Inflammation of the Lungs 
is to promote Expectoration, and to 
restore it when it is lost. 

|P_338

 If the Inflammation ends in a 
Gangrene, the Case is desperate; if 
in a Schirrus, incurable. 

There is a spurious sort of a Pe-
ripneumony, not inflammatory; when 
the Vessels are obstructed with a vis-
cous Pituite that mixeth with the 
Blood, and invades in cold Weather, 
it is dangerous, and often suffocates; 
it is incident to weak and old Peo-
ple. In this, some of the Methods 
used in the Inflammatory are pro-
per, but not so copious Bleeding, 
Clysters frequently injected; Ali-
ment more generous, Broths, and 
Jellies with Juice of Limon, Hydro-
mel, or Honey and Water; for 
Drink, soft Oils, and Aliments which 
abound with a soft, not volatile Oil, 
are beneficial. 

A Peripneumony is the last fatal 
Symptom of every Disease, for no 
Body dies without a Stagnation of 
the Blood in the Lungs; as long as 
|P_339
it circulates through the Lungs, it 
will circulate through the rest of the 
Body. The total Extinction of 
Breath is caus'd by the Stagnation of 
Blood in the Lungs. 

[}Pleurisy. }]
There is none of the Membranes 
which invest the Inside of the Breast, 
but may be the Seat of this Disease, 
the Mediastine as well as the Pleura. 

The Causes of this Disease, be-
sides those common to all Inflamma-
tions, are often a particular Disposi-
tion to inflammatory Distempers, a 
Straitness of the Arteries of the Pleu-
ra, a Callosity of that Membrane, 
an Adhesion of the Lungs, the sud-
den Admission of cold Air by too 
thin clothing, too hot a Regimen, 
and especially the copious use of spi-
rituous Liquors, cold Liquors drank 
when the Body is very hot, a Trans-
|P_340
lation of some inflammatory Matter 
from some other Part, but most of 
all cold Air from a Northerly or 
North-easterly Wind; from which 
Causes proper Cautions may be ta-
ken in the Regimen by way of Pre-
vention. 

This Disease is sometimes dry, 
without any Spitting, and sometimes 
attended with Expectoration from 
the Lungs, and that is taken off 
by a Coction and Resolution of the 
feverish Matter, or terminates in 
Suppurations, or a Gangrene. 

The Regimen ought to be much 
the same as in a Peripneumony, a 
cool, relaxing, slender, diluting Diet, 
and avoiding all things which in-
crease Heat, even too hot Air. 

The Symptoms of Suppuration 
are the same as in Inflammations of 
the Lungs; when the Matter is made, 
the Side must be opened to let it 
out. 

|P_341

 When the Disease is obstinate a-
gainst all Remedies, a sudden Abate-
ment of the Pain, a quick weak 
Pulse, sometimes intermitting, short 
Breath and cold Sweats are Symp-
toms of a Gangrene, and approach-
ing Death. 

[}Paraphrenitis, or Inflammation of the Diaphragm. }]
The Symptoms of this Disease 
(which is often mistaken) are a vio-
lent Fever, a most exquisite Pain in-
creas'd upon Inspiration; by which 
it is distinguish'd from a Pleurisy, in 
which the greatest Pain is in Expi-
ration. 

This Pain is increas'd by Sickness, 
Vomiting, Repletion of the Sto-
mach, or any Compression of the 
Muscles of the Abdomen, by render-
ing the Fæces or Urine. The Breath-
ing is extremely quick, suffocating, 
|P_342
and seems to be perform'd only by 
the Motion of the Breast: It is like-
wise attended with a Delirium, Fury, 
and an involuntary Laughter, the 
Convulsion emulating this Mo-
tion. 

This Disease terminates as Pleuri-
sies and Peripneumonies, but is ge-
nerally fatal if it suppurates the Pus, 
is evacuated into the lower Belly, 
where it produceth Putrefaction, and 
a most miserable and painful Death. 

The Regimen, if any can be suc-
cessful, ought to be the some as in 
Pleurisies. 

[}Inflammation of the Liver. }]
The hepatical Artery, and the Vena 
Porta, carry the Blood into the Liver; 
the first being very small, and the Mo-
tion of the Blood in the last being slow, 
is the reason that Inflammations in 
the Liver are not so frequent as in 
|P_343
some other Parts of the Body; 
but when they obtain, extremely dange-
rous, unless they take up but a small 
Part of the Liver, and such happen 
more frequently than is commonly 
imagined. 

Some of the best Cautions in Diet 
may be taken from the Causes and 
Symptoms of this Disease. 

Which, besides the general Causes 
of Inflammations, are extreme Fat-
ness. Fat dissolv'd by Heat and In-
flammations obstructs the Vessels of 
the Liver very suddenly. Cattle fat-
ted by good Pasturage, after violent 
Motion, sometimes die suddenly; in 
such the Liver is found to be in-
flamed and corrupted. An atrabila-
rian adust Temper of the Blood and 
Gall, an acrimonious or purulent 
Matter, stagnating in some other Or-
gan, is more easily deposited upon 
the Liver than any other Part, 
especially if attended with the use of 
hot and spicy Aliments, spirituous 
|P_344
Liquors, great Heat, and a Fever, 
Erosions, by the Acrimony of the 
Gall, or Obstructions by Viscosity; 
any Callosity, Schirrus, or Stone in 
the Liver; Thirst, long endur'd, be-
ing suddenly chill'd by cold Air, cold 
Water, or drinking cold Liquors after 
great Heat; Vomits given injudi-
ciously, when the Liver is already 
unsound, which if they do not re-
move the Obstruction, exagitate the 
Liver too much; inveterate hypo-
condriacal Distempers. All these 
Causes may produce Inflammations 
of the Liver. 

In such a Case, the Liver being 
swell'd compresseth the Stomach, Dia-
phragm, and the neighbouring vis-
cera of the lower Belly, stops the 
Circulation of the Juices, the Gene-
ration and Excretion of the Gall, 
and all Digestion; produceth an In-
finity of bad Symptoms, the Jaun-
dice, with all the Diseases depending 
upon it; for the Liver receives the 
|P_345
refluent Blood almost from all the 
Parts of the Abdomen, and is the 
chief Instrument of all the Dige-
stions which are made there. A Fe-
ver, an Inflammation and pungent 
Pain on the Region of the Liver 
and Diaphragm, a Tension of the 
Hypochondres, Yellowness of the 
Skin and Eyes, and a Saffron-colour'd 
Urine, are Signs of an inflammato-
ry Disposition of the Liver. 

This Disease ends as other Inflam-
mations, being cur'd either by Reso-
lution, Concoction, and Excretion 
of the morbid Matter, terminates in 
an Abscess, Schirrus, or Gangrene. 

During the first State, a warm Re-
gimen and Saffron, which is reckon'd 
a Specifick, is improper. 

Cooling resolving Liquors taken 
inwardly, as Whey, with Sorrel boil'd 
in it; outward Fomentations, and 
frequent Injection of Clysters, Bath-
ing and Frictions, relax, and render 
the Matter fluid; Honey, with a lit-
|P_346
tle Rhenish Wine, or Vinegar; the 
Juices and Jellies of some ripe Gar-
den Fruits; and those of some lactes-
cent papescent Plants, as Endive, 
Dandelion, Lettuce, are resolvent. 

Violent Purging hurts, gently re-
laxing the Belly relieves, Diluents 
with nitrous Salts are beneficial, or 
Tamarinds boil'd in warm Water or 
Whey; bloody Stools, not in an ex-
treme degree, or streak'd with Blood, 
ought not to be stop'd, because they 
help to resolve the Distemper, and 
Hæmorrages by the Nose often do 
the same. 

The feverish Matter is often car-
ried off by Urine, and therefore Di-
ureticks not highly stimulating, are
 proper. 

Sweating ought not to be promo-
ted by warm Cordials, but encourag'd 
by warm diluting Liquors. 

It is a deplorable Case when the 
Inflammation terminates in a Suppu-
ration, unless the Abscess points out-
|P_347
wardly, so as it may be opened; for 
if the Pus be evacuated into the Ab-
domen, it produceth dismal Symp-
toms, Putrefaction, or an incura-
ble hepatical Dysentery, or Bloody-
Flux. 

The Pus, from an Ulcer of the 
Lungs, growing thin and ichorose 
corrodes the Vessels (for the Liver of 
all the Viscera, is the most friable, 
and easily crumbled or dissolv'd) it 
is often carried into the Blood, and 
rejected by Vomiting, with a cada-
verous Smell, attended with great 
Thirst; if it is carried downward, it 
occasions a purulent colliquative Di-
arrhœa; acid Substances relieve most 
in this Case. 

This Disease may happen to pro-
duce a Cancer, or Schirrus; one can-
not say that the last is absolutely in-
curable, because it has been known 
by Experience that Grass and fresh 
Pasture has cur'd it in Cattle; and 
perhaps the express'd Juices of Grass, 
|P_348
and some opening Plants, may do the 
same thing in Mankind, as of the 
lactescent Plants above-mention'd. 

The Diet prescrib'd here is neces-
sary in a Jaundice, and all Diseases of 
the Liver; and Abstinence from such 
Substances as induce Putrefaction, 
especially salted Fish and Flesh, and 
above all, strong Liquors. 

[}Inflammation of the Stomach. }]
The Symptoms of this Disease are a 
vehement, burning, fix'd, pungent 
Pain in the Stomach, attended with 
a Fever; a great Exacerbation of 
this Pain the Moment after swallow-
ing any thing, succeeded with Vo-
miting; a painful Hickup, and great 
Anxiety. The Causes of these Symp-
toms are those common to all In-
flammations, a natural Weakness, 
and perhaps Erosion of the Coats 
of the Stomach, and acrid Substances 
taken as Aliment and Medicines. 

|P_349

If this Disease is not speedily cur'd, 
it proves fatal. 

It terminates in a Cure by a Reso-
lution of the morbifick Matter, a 
Suppuration, Schirrus, Cancer, but 
most commonly in a Gangrene. 

Of all Diseases this demands most 
a total Abstinence from every thing
 that has Acrimony in it, even the 
nitrous cooling Salts, which are be-
neficial in other Inflammations, ir-
ritate too much; Vomits, all Cor-
dials of volatile or spicy Substances; 
spirituous Liquors are no better than 
Poison, and Milk generally curdles; 
Aliments must be given frequently, 
and by Spoonfuls at a time, for any 
Distension increaseth the Inflamma-
tion; a thin Gruel of Barley, Oat-
meal, Whey, with very little Sugar, 
or Honey, or Chicken-Broth, are 
proper Aliments; Whey, emollient 
Decoctions, Barley-Water, Emulsions, 
are proper Drinks; and it has been 
found by Experience, that chalybeat 
|P_350
Waters have been agreeable to the 
Stomach even in this inflammatory 
State. If there happens an Impost-
hume, Honey, and even Honey of 
Roses, taken inwardly, is a good 
Cleanser, and Decoctions of Com-
frey Roots, healing; speedy and 
plentiful Bleeding, Fomentations, and 
Clysters, have the same good Effect 
as in other inflammatory Distem-
pers. 

The same Regimen is necessary 
in a Schirrus, or Cancer of the Sto-
mach; though nothing will be quite 
effectual. 

The same Regimen is to be ob-
served in the Inflammation of the 
Spleen, Caul, Pancreas. 

[}Inflammation of the Guts. }]
The Intestines or Guts, most fre-
quently the small ones, may be in-
flam'd by any acrid or poisonous 
Substance taken inwardly; from any 
|P_351
purulent Matter translated upon them 
from some other Part of the Body; 
from Bile, extremely acrimonious, by 
a violent Tension; from a Convulsion 
filling them with Wind. 

The Symptoms are a total Stop-
page of the Passage; a vehement fix'd 
burning Pain, irritated by things ta-
ken inwardly, when any thing touch-
eth the affected Part, it excites Vo-
miting, sharp griping Pains, with W
ind in other Parts of the Bowels; 
the Consequences of such an Inflam-
mation are an Ileus, what is com-
monly called the Twisting of the 
Guts, but is really either a Circum-
volution or Insertion of one part of 
the Gut within the other. All these 
Symptoms are attended with a Fe-
ver. 

It is of the utmost Importance to 
know what the Causes of Colicks 
are; for as they are various, the Re-
medies in one Case are quite oppo-
site and destructive in the other; for 
|P_352
the spicy warm carminative things 
which are given in a Colick, from a 
phlegmatick or cold Cause, are Poi-
son in an inflammatory one; they 
may be distinguish'd by the Fever, 
high Pulse, Thirst, and flame-co-
lour'd Urine attending the Inflam-
mation, as to the Heat, tho' it is 
great likewise by the Violence of the 
Pain, the Extremities grow cold; be-
sides, there is a sudden Prostration of 
the Strength or Weakness attending 
this Colick, more than any other. 

This Disease admits of a speedy 
Remedy, or none, for it ends in an 
Ileus, and Mortification of the Bow-
els very soon. 

Besides a copious Bleeding, there 
is hardly any other Method but fo-
menting and relaxing the Bowels by 
emollient tepid Liquids, both taken 
by the Mouth and by Clysters, in-
jected hourly; yet it has been known 
by Experience, that Acids have re-
lieved in very desperate Cases, as 
|P_353
Juice of Limons taken by the Mouth, 
and Vinegar and warm Water given 
in Clysters, have sav'd the Patient, 
because of the incessant Vomiting; 
Opiats to quiet the Convulsions are 
sometimes necessary. 

Warm Fomentations even of warm 
Animals to the Belly, are extremely 
beneficial. 

If the Inflammation happens to 
be in the lower Guts, it is not so 
dangerous; and even when it suppu-
rates, it admits of a Cure, then it 
can be reach'd by proper Medicines 
in the Form of Clysters; in the lat-
ter end of such a Case Chalybeat Wa-
ters are beneficial. 

If the Patient survives three Days, 
the Acuteness of the Pain abates, 
and a Chilliness or Gruing affects 
the Body, it betokens a Suppuration, 
and in a few Days the Matter flows 
either into the Cavity of the Abdo-
men, producing all the Symptoms 
which happen in the Imposthumation 
|P_354
of the Liver, or into the Cavity of 
the Intestines, and causing a puru-
lent Bloody-Flux, and often a Con-
sumption, Sinus's, Fistulas.

Whey and Chalybeat Waters are 
often beneficial in such a Case, as 
Drinks. 

The Aliment ought to be of such 
things as generate little or no Excre-
ments, as Broths of Flesh-Meat, with 
Scorzonera, Parsley, or Fennel boil'd 
in them; Goats Whey is likewise ex-
cellent; fat and oily Substances ge-
nerally hurt. 

The Continuance of the Fever, 
clammy Sweats, Paleness, an ichorose 
Diarrhœa, fœtid, black, or like the 
Washings of Flesh, a small intermit-
ting Pulse, and at last a total Cessa-
tion of Pain, are Signs of a Gan-
grene and approaching Death. 

If none of the foremention'd things 
happen, if the Fever abates, and the 
Patient complains of a Weight, dull 
Pain, Stoppage of the Excrements, 
|P_355
a Schirrus is forming, which increas-
eth daily, and may terminate in a 
Cancer, which Purging, and indeed 
all Medicines irritate; the Patient in 
such a Case may protract a miserable 
Life with an exact thin Diet of Whey, 
Broths, and such things as produce 
no Fœces, or by alimentary Clysters. 

[}A Thrush. }]
By this Name are call'd small, 
round, superficial, Ulcerations, which 
appear first in the Mouth, but as 
they proceed from the Obstruction 
of the Emissaries of the Saliva, by 
the Lentor and Viscosity of the Hu-
mour, they may affect every Part of 
the alimentary Duct, except the thick 
Guts; they often succeed Fevers, es-
pecially those that inflame the Inte-
stines, or are attended with a Loose-
ness; and they are just the same in 
the inward Parts as Scabs in the Skin, 
and fall off from the Inside of the 
|P_356

Bowels like a Crust: The nearer they 
approach to a white Colour, the less 
dangerous. 

The viscous Matter is to be push'd 
out, therefore Bleeding in the begin-
ning is not proper, nor Sudorificks, 
because they thicken; but Sweating 
is beneficial, when the Matter is quite 
push'd out; tepid, diluent and small 
Liquors are good in the first State, 
and Bathing, if the Patient can bear 
it, with Gargarisms, Clysters; after-
wards the Food ought to be nourish-
ing, detergent, Panadas with Bread 
and Water, Bread and Milk, Ho-
ney mix'd with the Aliment, when
 they fall, Aliment demulcent, soft, 
anodyne, and the moderate use 
of Rhenish Wine; when they are 
separated, lenitive, purging Sub-
stances. 

|P_357
[}Inflammations of the Kidneys. }]
The Kidneys are subject to Inflam-
mations as much as other Parts of 
the Body. 

A pungent Pain in the Region 
of the Kidneys, a Stupor, or dull 
Pain in the Thigh, Colick, Wind, 
Vomiting, a Fever, Urine some-
times totally suppress'd, in small 
Quantity, high colour'd; and which is 
worse, sometimes quite pale, with-
out any Sediment, are Symptoms of 
an Inflammation of the Kidneys; as 
to the Sensation of outward Heat, 
the Extremity of Pain often creates a 
Coldness in the Extremities, but such 
a Sensation is very consistent with an 
inflammatory Distemper. 

Whatever obstructs the Blood in 
the Extremities of the Arteries of the 
Kidneys, will produce this Disease; 
a Wound, Abscess, Bruise, Swelling, 
Lying much on the Back, too vio-
|P_358
lent Motion, especially walking in 
hot Weather; whatever obstructs the 
Passage of the Urine, as a viscous 
Matter, Gravel or Stone; every thing 
which drives the Blood into the Uri-
nary Canals, Heat, hard Riding, too 
great Fulness of Blood, but especially 
sharp and forcing Diureticks: Last-
ly, Spasms and involuntary Contrac-
tions of the Vessels of the Kidneys. 

Coffee-colour'd Urine is not a dan-
gerous Symptom; it proceeds indeed 
from a Mixture of a small Quantity 
of Blood with the Urine, but often 
prognosticates a Resolution of the 
obstructing Matter, and the Expul-
sion of Gravel or a Stone after great 
Pain; pale Urine is a Symptom of 
a more lasting and dangerous Di-
sease. 

After plentiful Bleeding, and a 
careful avoiding of all stimulating 
Diureticks, which in this State of the 
Disease will increase it, the Expul-
sion of the obstructing Cause must 
|P_359
 be promoted by emollient and soft 
Liquors drank plentifully, by Cly-
sters of the same frequently injected, 
by Bathing and outward Fomenta-
tions, by opiat and anodyne Sub-
stances, which stupify and relax the 
Fibres; those Liquors must be swal-
low'd down notwithstanding the con-
tinual Vomiting; for Vomiting is 
the Instrument of Nature to promote 
the Expulsion of the Stone Gravel, 
or other obstructing Cause. 

Whey, and in a great feverish 
Heat, Butter-Milk, Emulsions of 
Barley and Poppy Seeds, Honey in 
Whey and Water, are proper Liquors 
for this Intention. 

When the Gravel, Stone, or other 
obstructing Cause is separated from 
the Kidney, soft express'd Oils, and 
oily Substances relax the Passages; if 
the Pain proceeds only from Gravel, 
or a Stone, oily Substances may be 
join'd safely with stimulating Sub-
stances, as with Juice of Limon, Ju-
|P_360
niper-Water, and some diuretick Syr-
rup; this by the way, for it is out 
of my present Subject. 

Violent Motion, as jolting in a 
Coach, may be us'd in this Case. 

The Pain protracted beyond seven 
Days, a Pulsation, Chillness, often 
and irregularly returning, a Heaviness 
and Stupor in the Part, are Signs of 
making of Matter, which when 
made will appear in the Urine. 

In which Case soft and balsamick 
Substances are beneficial, for if the 
Matter stays long, the Case is incu-
rable. 

It happens sometimes to end in a 
Fistula, with which the Patient may live many 
Years in no great Uneasi-
finess. Butter-Milk, not very sour, 
has been reckon'd a great Secret in 
Ulcers of the Kidneys, and Chalybeat 
Waters have been beneficial to some; 
Spruce Beer is a good Balsamick in 
such a Case: I should advise soft Malt 
Liquors rather than Wine. 

|P_361

Inflammations of the Kidneys 
sometimes end in a Schirrus, or great 
Stone in the Kidneys. 

A sudden Remission of the 
Pain, with cold Sweats, weak and inter-
mitting Pulse, Hickup; no Urine, 
or in small Quantity, black and fœ-
tid, are Signs of a Mortification and 
approaching Death. 

The Regimen of such as are sub-
ject to nephritick Symptoms may be
 in some measure taken from what is 
above-mentioned. 

Such ought to be extremely care-
ful of the choice of their Liquors; 
sharp Wines which abound with 
Tartar, are hurtful; Malt Liquors, 
not hard, nor stale, are certainly bet-
ter to make use of; some of the 
softest Diureticks mentioned Chap. I. 
No 15. to avoid acrimonious Sub-
stances in their Aliment, use mode-
rate Exercise, and not to lie hot, soft,
nor much upon the Back. 

|P_362
[}Apoplexy. }]
This Disease is a sudden Abolition 
of all the Senses, external and inter-
nal, and of all voluntary Motion, by 
the Stoppage of the Flux or Reflux 
of the Animal Spirits through the 
Nerves destin'd for those Motions, 
commonly attended with a strong 
Pulse, laborious Breathing, a deep 
Sleep with Snorting. 

There is no difference between a 
Person asleep, and in an Apoplexy, 
but that the one can be awak'd, and 
the other cannot. 

The Causes of this Disease are a 
particular Confirmation of the Body, 
as a short Neck; for there be some 
who have fewer Vertebræ in their 
Necks than others; long-necked Peo-
ple are subject to Consumptions, and 
short-neck'd to Apoplexies, tho' this 
Rule is not generally true; a gross, ple-
thorick, fat, phlegmatick Constitu-
|P_363
tion; whatever hinders the Motion 
of the Blood through the Arteries of 
the Brain, as polypose Concretions, 
especially about the Heart, attended, 
commonly with an unequal Pulse, a 
Vertigo, and sometimes a momenta-
ry Loss of the Eye-sight; an inflam-
matory and coreaceous Thickness of 
the Blood, preceded by a Fever, at-
tended with the Head-ach, Redness 
of the Face and Eyes; Old Age, at-
tended with a glutinous, cold, ca-
tarrhous, leucophlegmatick Constitu-
tion; in such, the Forerunners of 
an Apoplexy are Dulness, Inactivity, 
Drowsiness, Sleepiness, Slowness of 
Speech and giving Answers, Verti-
goes, Tremblings, Oppressions in 
Sleep, Night-Mares; Weakness, Wa-
teryness, and Turgidity of the Eyes; 
pituitous Vomiting, laborious Breath-
ing upon the smallest Motion; what-
ever compresseth the Vessels of the 
Brain so as to stop the Flux of the 
animal Spirits and Blood; a great 
|P_364
Fulness of Blood with its Velocity, 
increas'd by Heat, violent Motion, 
a high Diet, spirituous Liquors, Tu-
mours of any kind; within the Skull 
a partial and imperfect Circulation 
of the Blood towards the lower 
Parts. The Effusion and Pressure of 
any Serosity or Blood upon the Ven-
tricles of the Brain (which is the 
most common and immediate Cause 
of Apoplexies) violent Passions and 
Affections of the Mind. The im-
mediate Forerunners of an Apo-
plexy are commonly a Vertigo, 
Staggering, Loss of Memory, Stu-
por, Sleepiness, a Noise in the Ears, 
and a more deep and laborious 
Breathing; those last Symptoms com-
monly precede an Apoplexy, but 
they are likewise common to it with 
other nervous and hysterical Distem-
pers. 

Attention to the foremention'd 
Symptoms affords the best Cautions 
and Rules of Diet by way of Pre-
|P_365
vention; for when it has taken place 
Hippocrates's Prognostick is generally 
true, That it is very hard to resolve 
a small Apoplexy, and quite impos-
sible to resolve a great one, the gen-
tlest Kind of this Disease is often ta-
ken off by Sweating. 

The Applications in the Fit are 
of the Medicinal Kind, it being too 
acute a Disease to admit of any Helps 
from Diet, but that may be of great 
use for Prevention; a thin, slender, 
cool, regular Diet, opposite to the 
particular Symptoms above-men-
tion'd; frequent and copious Bleed-
ing; keeping the Belly always open; 
stimulating Substances, which have 
been thought beneficial, in this Case 
very often hurt, by forcing the Blood 
too much up to the Head; Vomit-
ing may prove extremely pernicious, 
but the Regimen is to be varied ac-
cording to the Cause of the Disease, 
which may be collected from the 
Constitution of the Patient in these 
|P_366
Apoplexies, which depend upon a 
sanguineous Cause: The Regimen 
prescrib'd in sanguineous Constitu-
tions is proper; fat and phlegma-
tick People, who are very subject to 
this Disease, ought to attend to the 
Rules prescribed in their Case; and 
as there are Apoplexies from invete-
rate Gouts, the Regimen of such 
must be different from both, the 
Intention being to translate the mor-
bifick Matter upon the Extremities of 
the Body. 

Those who have a Disposition to 
this Disease ought never to go to 
Bed with a full Stomach, nor to lie 
with their Head low. 

An Apoplexy is resolv'd by a Fe-
ver, and when not fatal terminates in 
a Palsy. 

There is a Disease of the same 
Kind, but not so frequent, call'd a 
Catalepsis, wherein the Patient is 
suddenly seiz'd without Sense or Mo-
tion, and remains in the same Po-
|P_367
sture in which the Disease seizeth 
him, the Muscles remaining in the 
same Tension: Violent Fevers in 
strong atrabilarious dry Constitutions 
has produc'd this Distemper; the 
Diet after the Fit is off ought to be 
moistening and relaxing. A Lethar-
gy is a lighter sort of Apoplexy, 
and demands the same Cure and 
Diet as an Apoplexy from a phleg-
matick Case, such being the Consti-
tution of the Lethargick.
