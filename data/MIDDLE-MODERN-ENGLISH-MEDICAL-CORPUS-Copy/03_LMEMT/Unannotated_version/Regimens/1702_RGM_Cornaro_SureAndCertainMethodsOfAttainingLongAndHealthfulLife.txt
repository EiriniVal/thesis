[}Of a Sober and Regular Life. }]
NOthing is more certain, than 
that Custom becomes a se- 
cond Nature, and has a great In- 
fluence upon our Bodies. Nay, it 
has too often more Power over 
the Mind, than Reason it self. 
The honestest Man alive, in keep- 
ing company with Libertines, by 
degrees forgets the Maxims of Pro- 
bity, which he had imbibed from 
the very Breast, and gives himself 
the Loose in those Vices which he 
sees practis'd. If he be so happy 
as to relinquish that bad Company, 
and to meet with Better, Vertue 
will triumph in its Turn; and he 
|P_2
insensibly resumes the Wisdom 
which he had abandoned. In a 
word, all the Alterations which 
we perceive in the Temper, Carri- 
age, and Manners of most men, have 
scarce any other Foundation, but the 
force and prevalency of Custom. 

I have observ'd, that 'tis Custom 
which has given Rise to two very 
dangerous Evils within a little time 
in Italy; the first I reckon to be 
Flattery and Ceremonies; and the 
second, Intemperance both in Eat- 
ing and Drinking. 

The first of these banishes out of 
human Conversation, all Plain-deal- 
ing, Frankness and Sincerity: And 
against the latter I declare open war, 
as being the most destructive of 
health, and the greatest Enemy it has. 

'Tis an Unhappiness into which 
the Men of this Age are fal'n, that 
Variety of Dishes is A-la-mode, 
and become so far preferable to 
Frugality. And yet the One is 
|P_3
the Product of Temperance; whilst 
Pride and an unrestrained Appetite 
is the Parent of the Other. Notwith- 
standing the difference of their Ori- 
gine, yet Prodigality is at present 
stiled Magnificence, Generosity, and 
Grandeur, and is commonly esteem- 
ed of in the World; whilst Frugality 
passes for Avarice, and Sordidness [/1./]
Spirit in the Eyes of most Men. 
Here is a visible Error, which Cu- 
stom and Habit have establish'd. 

This Error has so far seduced us, 
that it has prevailed upon us to 
renounce a frugal way of Living, 
tho' taught us by Nature even 
from the first Age of the World, 
as being that which would prolong 
our Days; and has cast us into 
those Excesses, which serve only to 
abridge the Number of them. We 
become Old, before we have been 
able to taste the Pleasure of being 
Young; and the Time which 
ought to be the Summer of our 
|P_4
Lives, is often the beginning of 
their Winter. We soon perceive 
our Strength to fail, and Weakness 
to come on apace, and decline even 
before we come to perfection. On 
the contrary, Sobriety maintains 
us in the natural State wherein we 
ought to be: Our Youth is last- 
ing, and our Manhood attended 
with a Vigor that does not begin 
to decay till after a great many 
Years. A whole Century must be 
run out before Wrinkles can be for- 
med on the Face, or gray Hairs grow 
on the Head. This is so true, that 
when Men were not addicted to 
Voluptuousness, they had more 
Strength and Vivacity at fourscore, 
than we have at present at forty. 

O unhappy Italy! Dost thou 
not perceive that Gluttony and 
Excess robs Thee every Year of 
more Inhabitants than Pestilence, 
War and Famine could have de- 
stroyed? Thy true Plagues are thy 
|P_5
frequent Feastings, which are so 
extravagant, that no Tables can be 
made large enough to hold that 
Number of Dishes which Prodiga- 
lity lays upon them, but they are 
forced to be heap'd upon one ano- 
ther in Pyramids. What Madness, 
what Fury is this? Regulate this 
Disorder, if not for God's sake, 
yet for thy own. I am sure there 
is no Sin, that displeases him 
more, nor any Voluptuousness that 
can be more pernicious to thy self. 
Endeavour then to heal thy self of 
this as being one of those Epide- 
mical Distempers, from which 
thou may'st be preferv'd by whole- 
some Food, and by the Precautions 
that may prevent them. 'Tis ve- 
ry easie to avoid the Evils which 
an Excess in Eating or Drinking 
may bring upon us; nor is it any 
hard Matter to find out a Sovereign 
Remedy against Repletion, since 
Nature it self has taught us it. Let 
|P_6
us only give it what it requires, 
and not over-charge it; for a small 
Matter suffices Nature. The Rules 
of Temperance are derived from 
those of Right Reason. Let us 
accustom our selves to eat only to 
support Life; what is more than 
necessary for our Nourishment 
sows the Seeds of Sickness and 
Death; 'tis a Pleasure for which 
we must pay very dear, and 
which can neither be innocent, nor 
excusable, since it may be so pre- 
judicial to us. 

How many have I seen cut off 
in the flower of their Days by the 
unhappy Custom of High-feeding? 
How many excellent Friends has 
Gluttony deprived me of, who 
might have been still an Orna- 
ment to the World, an Honour 
to their Country, and have occa- 
sioned me as much Satisfaction in 
enjoying them, as now I have Sor- 
row in losing them? 

|P_7
'Tis to put a stop to this spread- 
ing Contagion that I have under- 
taken to shew in this small Tract, 
that the Number and Variety of 
Dishes is a fatal Abuse which ought 
to be corrected, by living soberly, 
as did the Patriarchs of Old. Se- 
veral young Persons, who for 
their good Qualities, merit my 
Esteem, having lost their Fathers 
sooner than they could have expe- 
cted, have express'd a great desire 
of being acquainted with my man- 
ner of Living. I could not but 
think their Curiosity very rea- 
sonable, since nothing is more rea- 
sonable than to wish for long Life. 
The more we advance in Years, 
the larger will our Experience be; 
and if Nature, which aims only at 
our Good, advises us to grow Old, 
and concurs with us in that De- 
sign, 'tis because she is sensible that 
the Body being weakned by Time, 
which destroys all Things, the 
|P_8
Mind, when disingaged from the 
Snares of Voluptuousness, is more 
at Leisure to make use of its Rea- 
son, and to taste the Sweets of 
Vertue. Hereupon I was willing 
to satisfie those Persons, and at 
the same time to do some Service 
to the Publick, by declaring what 
were the Motives that induced me 
to renounce Intemperance, and 
live a sober Life; by shewing the 
Method I observe, and what Be- 
nefit I find thereby; and lastly, by 
demonstrating that nothing can be 
more beneficial to a Man, than to 
observe a Regimen, that it is pra- 
cticable and very necessary to be 
followed. 

I say then that the Weakness of 
my Constitution, which was con- 
siderably increas'd by my way of 
Living, cast me into so deplorable 
a Condition, that I was forced to 
bid a final Adieu to all Feastings, 
to which I had all my Life-long a 
|P_9
violent Inclination. I was so often 
engaged in Excesses of this kind, 
that my tender Constitution could 
not hold up under the Fatigues of 
them. I fell into several Distem- 
pers, such as Pains of the Stomach, 
the Cholick, and the Gout. I had 
a lingring Fever, and an intolerable 
Thirst continually hanging upon 
me. This made me despair of any 
Cure, and tho' I was then not above 
35 or 40 Years old, yet I had no 
hopes of finding any other end of 
my Distempers, but what should 
end my Life too. 

The best Physicians in Italy
made use of all their Skill for my 
Recovery, but without success. At 
last when they quite despair'd of 
me, they told me that they knew 
only of one Remedy that could 
cure me, if I had Resolution 
enough to undertake and continue 
it, to wit, a sober and Regular 
Life, which they exhorted me to 
|P_10
live the remainder of my Days, 
assuring me, that if Intemperance 
had brought so many Distempers, 
it was only Temperance that could 
free me from them. 

I relish'd this Proposal; and per- 
ceiv'd that notwithstanding the 
miserable Condition to which my 
Intemperance had reduced me, 
yet I was not so incurable, but 
the Contrary might recover or at 
least ease me. And I was the more 
easily perswaded to it, because I 
knew several Persons of a great 
Age, and a bad Constitution, who 
only prolonged their Lives by Ob- 
serving a Regimen, whilst on the 
other hand I knew others who 
were born with a wonderful Con- 
stitution, and yet broke it by their 
Debaucheries. It seem'd very na- 
tural to me, that a different Way 
of living and acting produces dif- 
ferent Effects; since Art may con- 
duce to correct, perfect, weaken, 
|P_11
or destroy Nature according to the 
good or bad Use that is made of 
it. 

The Physicians beginning to find 
me tractable, added to what they 
had before told me, that I must 
either choose a Regimen or Death; 
that I could not live if I did 
not follow their Advice, and that 
if I defer'd much longer taking my 
Resolutions accordingly, it would 
be too late to do it. This was 
home; I was loth to die so soon, 
and I could not tell how to bear 
the Thoughts of it; besides, I 
was convinced of their Experience 
and Ability. In short, being mo- 
rally certain, that my best way was 
to believe them, I resolved upon 
putting into Practice this Course of 
Life, how austere soever it seem'd 
to me. 

I intreated my Physicians to in- 
form me exactly, after what man- 
ner I ought to govern my self. To 
|P_12
this they reply'd, That I must al- 
ways manage my self as a sick Per- 
son, eat nothing but what was 
good, and that in a small Quantity. 

They had a long time before 
prescribed the same Thing to me; 
but till then I made a Jest of it. 
When I was cloy'd with the Diet 
they order'd me, I did eat of all 
those Meats which they had for- 
bidden, and perceiving my self 
hot and dry, I drank Wine in 
abundance. However, I do not 
boast of this my Conduct; I was 
one of those imprudent Patients, 
who not being able to resolve up- 
on doing whatever is prescribed 
them for their Health, mind no- 
thing else but deceiving their Phy- 
sicians, tho' they prove the greatest 
Cheats to themselves at last. 

As soon as I resolv'd to believe 
my Physicians, and thought that 
it was a disgrace not to have Cou- 
rage enough to be Wise; I accu- 
|P_13
stomed my self so much to live so- 
berly, that I contracted a Habit of 
so doing, without any Trouble or 
Violence offer'd to my self. In a little 
time I found relief, and (which 
may seem to some incredible) at 
the Year's end I found my self not 
only on the mending hand, but 
I was perfectly cured of all my 
Distempers. 

When I saw I was recovered, 
and began to taste the Sweets of 
this sort of Resurrection, I made 
abundance of Reflections upon 
the Usefulness of a Regular 
Life. I admir'd the Efficacy of 
it, and perceiv'd that if it had 
been so powerful as to cure me, it 
would be capable enough of pre- 
serving me from those Distempers 
to which I had been always sub- 
ject. 

The Experience I had thereof 
removing all farther Scruple, I 
began to study what Food was pro- 
|P_14
per for me. I was minded to try 
whether what pleased my Taste 
were Beneficial or Prejudicial to 
my Health, and whether the Pro- 
verb were true, which says, That 
what delights the Palate, cannot but 
be good for the Heart. I found it to 
be false; and that it only serves as an 
Excuse to the Sensualists, who are 
for indulging themselves in what- 
ever might please their Appetites. 

Formerly I could not drink my 
Wine with Ice; I loved heady 
Wines, Melons, all Sorts of raw 
Fruits, Salads, salt Meats, high Sau- 
ces and baked Meats, notwithstand- 
ing they were prejudicial to me. 
Hereupon I made no account of the 
Proverb, and being convinced of its 
falsity , I made choice of such Wines 
and Meats as agreed with my Con- 
stitution: I proportion'd the Quanti- 
ty thereof according to the strength 
of my Stomach. I declin'd all 
Diet that did not agree with 
|P_15
me; and made it a Law to my 
self to lay a restraint upon my 
Appetite, so that I always rose 
from Table with a Stomach to eat 
more if I pleas'd. In a word, I 
entirely renounced Intemperance, 
and made a Vow to continue the 
Remainder of my Life under the 
same Regimen that I had observ'd: 
A happy Resolution this, the keep- 
ing whereof has freed me from all 
my Insirmities, which without it 
were incurable! I never before liv- 
ed a Year together without falling 
once at least into some violent Di- 
stemper; but this never happen'd 
to me afterwards; on the contrary 
I have been always Healthful ever 
since I have been Temperate. 

The Nourishment which I take, 
being in Quality and Quantity just 
enough to suffice Nature, breeds 
no such corrupt Humours as spoil 
the best Constitutions. 'Tis true 
indeed, that besides this Precaution 
|P_16
I made use of many others. For 
instance, I took care to keep my 
self from Heats and Colds: I ab- 
stain'd from all violent Exercises, 
as also from ill Hours and Wo- 
men. I no longer lived in Pla- 
ces where was an unwholesome 
Air, and took special Care to 
avoid the being exposed to 
violent Winds, or to the excessive 
Heat of the Sun. All these Cau- 
tions may seem morally impossible 
to those Men, who in their 
Transactions in the World follow 
no other Guides but their own 
Passions; and yet they are not 
hard to be practis'd, when a Man 
can be so just to himself as to pre- 
fer the Preservation of his Health 
to all the Pleasures of Sense and 
the necessary Hurry of Business. 

I likewise found it advantageous 
to me not to abandon my self to 
Melancholy, by banishing out of my 
Mind whatever might occasion it: I 
|P_17
made use of all the Powers of my 
Reason to restrain the force of 
those Passions, whose Violence 
does often break the Constitution 
of the strongest Bodies. 'Tis true 
indeed, that I was not always so 
much a Philosopher, nor yet so Cau- 
tious, but that sometimes I fell 
into those Disorders that I would 
have avoided; but this rarely hap- 
pen'd, and the Guard I kept over 
my Appetite, which ought chiefly 
to be minded, prevented all the 
pernicious Consequences which 
might have arisen from my petty 
Irregularities. 

This is certain, that the Passions 
have less Influence, and cause less 
Disorder in a Body that is regular 
in its Diet, than in another which 
gives the loose to the Cravings of 
an inordinate Appetite. Galen made 
this Observation before me; and 
I might produce several Authorities 
to support this Opinion, but I will 
|P_18
go only upon mine own Experience. 
It was impossible for me sometimes 
to abstain from the Extreams of 
Hot and Cold, and to get an en- 
tire Mastery over all the Occasions 
of Trouble which had cros'd my 
whole Life; but yet these Emo- 
tions made no alteration in the 
State of my Health: And I met 
with a great many Instances of 
Persons who sunk under a less 
Weight, both of Body and Mind. 

There was in our Family a con- 
siderable Suit of Law depending 
against some Persons, whose Might 
overcame our Right. One of my 
Brothers, and some of my Relati- 
ons, who having never smarted for 
their Debauches, were the more free 
to indulge them, could not conquer 
that Concern which the Loss of this 
Suit of Law wrought in them, 
and perfectly died of Grief. I was 
as sensible as they were, of the In- 
justice that was done us, but I did 
|P_19
not die for it; and I attribute 
their Loss and my Welfare to the 
Difference in our way of Living. 
I was made amends for that Dis- 
grace by the Comfort I had of not 
sinking under it; and now make no 
manner of Doubt, but that the Pas- 
sions are less violent in a Man that 
lives soberly, than in one that does 
not. 

At seventy Years of Age I had 
another Experiment of the Useful- 
ness of my Regimen. A Business 
of an extraordinary Consequence 
drawing me into the Country, my 
Coach-Horses went faster than I 
would have them; being lash'd 
with the Whip, they got a head 
and ran away with me. I was 
over-thrown, and drag'd a long 
way before they could stop the 
Horses. They took me out of the 
Coach, with my Head broken, a 
Leg and an Arm out of Joynt, and 
in a word, in a very lamentable 
|P_20
Condition. As soon as they 
brought me Home again, they 
sent for the Physicians, who did 
not expect I could live three 
days to an end: However, they 
resolved upon letting me Blood to 
prevent the coming of a Fever, 
which usually happens in such 
Cases. I was so confident that 
the regular Life which I had led, 
had prevented the contracting of 
any ill Humours which I might 
be afraid of, that I oppos'd their 
Prescription. I order'd them to dress 
my Head, to set my Leg and my 
Arm, to rub me with some speci- 
fick Oils proper for Bruises, and 
without any other Remedies I was 
soon cured, to the great Astonish- 
ment of the Physicians, and of all 
those who knew me. From hence 
I infer, that a regular Life is an 
excellent Preservative against all 
Natural Evils, and that Intempe- 
rance produces quite contrary Ef- 
fects. 

|P_21
About four Years ago, I was over- 
perswaded to do a thing which had 
like to have cost me dear. My 
Relations whom I love, and who 
have a real Tenderness for me; 
my Friends with whom I was wil- 
ling to comply in any thing that 
was reasonable; lastly, my Physi- 
cians who were look'd upon as 
the Oracles of Health, did all 
agree, that I eat too little; 
that the Nourishment I took 
was not sufficient for one of 
my Years; that I ought not only 
to support Nature, but likewise to 
increase the Vigour of it by eat- 
ing a little more than I did. It 
was in vain for me to represent to 
them, that Nature is content with 
a little; that this Little having 
preserved me so long in Health, 
Custom was become a second Na- 
ture to me: That it was more 
reasonable, since Natural Heat 
abates in proportion as one grows 
|P_22
older, that I should likewise 
abridge my Allowance in Diet. 

To add the greater force to my 
Opinion, I mentioned to them the 
Proverb which saith, He that eats 
little, eats much; that is, if a Man 
is willing to live long in the en- 
joyment of his Food, let him live 
sparingly. I likewise told them, 
that what One leaves at a Meal 
does one more good, than what 
one has already eaten. But all 
this could not prevail upon them; 
and being wearied with their Im- 
portunities, I was forced to sub- 
mit. Having theresore before been 
used to take twelve Ounces, in 
Bread, Soops, Yolks of Eggs, and 
Meat, I increas'd it to fourteen 
Ounces a Day; and drinking 
about fourteen Ounces of Wine, I 
added Two Ounces more, and made 
it sixteen. 

This Augmentation of Diet 
was so prejudicial to me, that as 
|P_23
brisk as I was, I began to be sad 
and out of Humour; every thing 
offended me, and upon the least 
Occasion I broke out into a Pas- 
sion, so that a Dog (as they say) 
would not live with me. At 
twelve days end I was taken 
with a violent Fit of the Cho- 
lick, and that followed by a 
continual Fever, which torment- 
ed me for Five and thirty days 
together, and for the first fif- 
teen days put me into such an 
Agony, that it was impossible for 
me to take a quarter of an hours 
sleep at a time. There was no oc- 
casion to ask my Friends whether 
they despair'd of my Life, and 
whether they repented of the ad- 
vice they had given me; for they 
several times believed that I was 
a dying Man, just giving up the 
Ghost. However, I recovered, 
tho' I was seventy eight Years of 
Age, and tho' we had a harder Win- 
|P_24
ter than is usual in our Cli- 
mate. 

Nothing freed me from this 
Danger, but the Regimen which I 
had so long observ'd. It had pre- 
vented me from contracting those 
ill Humours, with which they are 
troubled in their old Age, who are 
not so wife as to take care of 
themselves whilst they are Young. 
I did not perceive in me the old 
Leaven of those Humours, and 
having nothing to struggle with 
but the new ones, which were oc- 
casioned by this small Addition to 
my Diet, I opposed and conquer'd 
my Indisposition, notwithstanding 
its force. 

From this Sickness, and my Re- 
covery from it, we may discern, what 
an Influence a Regimen has over 
us, which preserv'd me from 
Death, and what a Power Reple- 
tion has, which in so few days 
brought me to the last Extremity. 
|P_25
'Tis probable that Order being 
necessary for the Conservation of 
the Universe, and our Bodily Life 
being nothing else but a Harmony 
and perfect Agreement between the 
Elementary Qualities of which our 
Bodies are compos'd, we cannot 
live long in a disorderly Course of 
Life, of which nothing but Cor- 
ruption can possibly come. 

Order indeed is so exceeding Be- 
neficial, that it cannot be too strictly 
observed in every thing. 'Tis by the 
Means of this that we arrive to the 
perfection of Arts, and an easy accom- 
plishment in the Sciences. It renders 
Armies Victorious, keeps up the Ci- 
vil Policy of Cities, and Concord in 
Families: It renders whole Nations 
flourishing; in a word, it is the 
support and preserver both of the 
Civil and Natural Life; and the 
best remedy that can be applied to 
all Evils, whether Publick or Pri- 
vate. 

|P_26
When a disinterested Physician 
waits upon a Patient, let him re- 
member to recommend to him his 
Diet, and especially a Regimen 
therein in order to his Recovery. 
This is certain, that if all Men 
would live regularly and frugally, 
there would be so few sick Persons, 
that there would hardly be any oc- 
casion for Remedies; ev'ry one would 
become his own Physician, and would 
be convinced that he could never 
meet with a better. It would be to 
little purpose to study the Consti- 
tution of other Men; every one, if 
he would but apply himself to it, 
would always be better acquainted 
with his own, than with that of 
another; every one would be ca- 
pable of making those Experiments 
for himself, which another could 
not do for him, and would be the 
best judge of the strength of his 
own Stomach, and the Food 
which is agreeable thereto; for in 
|P_27
one word, 'tis next to impossible to 
know exactly the Constitution of 
another, the Constitutions of Men 
being as different from one another 
as their Complexions. Who now for 
instance, would imagine that Old 
Wine should be hurtful, and New 
Wine wholesome to me? That 
things which are looked upon to be 
hot by Nature should refresh and 
strengthen me? What Physician 
could have observed in me those 
Effects, so uncommon in most Bo- 
dies, and so contrary to the Notions 
of Mankind, when I my self was at 
no small pains in discovering the 
Causes thereof after abundance of 
Trials, which prove the difference of 
Mens Constitutions? 

Since no Man therefore can have 
a better Physician than himself, nor 
a more Sovereign Antidote than a 
Regimen, every one ought to fol- 
ow my Example; that is, to study 
his own Constitution, and to Re- 
|P_28
gulate his Life according to the 
Rules of right Reason. 

I own indeed that a Physician 
may be sometimes necessary; since 
there are some Distempers which 
all human Prudence cannot provide 
against. There happen some un- 
avoidable Accidents, which seise us 
after such a manner as to deprive 
our Judgment of the Liberty it 
ought to have to be a comfort to us. 
It is foolishness then wholly to rely 
upon Nature, it must have a sup- 
ply, and recourse must be had to 
some one or other for it. 

If the presence of a Friend who 
comes to visit a sick Person and to testi- 
fie the Concern he has for his Illness, 
be a Comfort and Refreshment to 
him; there is greater reason to be- 
lieve that the Visit of a Physician 
must needs be more agreeable, being 
a Friend upon whose Advice and 
Care we may depend for a speedy 
Recovery of our Health; but for 
|P_29
the Maintaining of that Health 
there needs no other support but a 
Sober and Regular Life. 'Tis a 
Specisick and Natural Medicine, 
which preserves the Man, how ten- 
der soever his Constitution be, and 
prolongs his Life to above a Hun- 
dred Years, spares him the Pain 
of a violent Death, sends him 
quietly out of the World, when the 
Radical Moisture is quite spent, 
and which, in short, has all the 
Properties that are fancied to be in 
Aurum Potabile, and the Elixir which 
a great many Persons have sought 
after in vain. 

But alas! most Men suffer them- 
selves to be seduced by the Charms 
of a Voluptuous Life. They have 
not courage enough to deny their 
Appetites; and being over-swayed 
by their prejudices so far, as to 
think they cannot prevent the gra- 
tification of them without abridg- 
ing too much of their Pleasures, 
|P_30
they form Systems whereby to per- 
suade themselves, that it is more 
eligible to live Ten Years less, than 
to be upon the Restraint, and de- 
prived of whatever may gratifie 
the Cravings of their Appetites. 

Alas! They know not the value 
of Ten Years Healthful Life in an 
Age when a Man may enjoy the 
full use of his Reason and make an 
advantage of all his Experiences: 
In an Age wherein a Man may ap- 
pear to be truly such by his Wisdom 
and Conduct; lastly, in a time 
wherein he is in a condition of reap- 
ing the fruits of his Studies and La- 
bours. 

To instance only in the Sciences; 
it is certain, that the best Books 
which we have extant, were com- 
posed in those last Ten Years which 
the Intemperate despise; and that 
Men's Minds growing to perfection 
proportionably as their Bodies grow 
old, Arts and Sciences would have 
|P_31
lost a great deal of their Perfection, 
if all the Great Men who were 
Professors of them had lived Ten 
Years shorter than they did. For 
my part, I think it proper to 
keep the fatal day of my Death as 
far off as I can. If this had 
not been my resolution, I should 
not have finished several Pieces, 
which will be both pleasing and 
instructing to those who come after 
me. 

The Sensualists farther Object, 
That it is impossible to live a Regu- 
lar Life. To this I Reply; That 
Galen, who was so Great a Man, 
made choice of it, and advised 
others to do the same, as being the 
best Course they could take. Plato, 
Cicero, Isocrates, and a great many 
Famous Men of past Ages embra- 
ced it; and in our Times, Pope 
Paul Farneze, Cardinal Bembo, and 
Two of our Doges, Lando and 
Donato, have practised it, and 
|P_32
thereby arrived to an extreme Old 
Age. I might instance in others 
of a meaner Extract; but, having 
followed this Rule my self, I think 
I cannot produce a more convincing 
proof of its being practicable, and 
that the greatest trouble to be met 
with therein is the first resolving 
and entring upon such a Course 
of Life. 

You will tell me that Plato, as 
Sober a Man as he was, yet affirm- 
ed, That a Man devoted to the 
Administration of the Government 
in publick Affairs, can hardly lead 
an Exact and Regular Life, being 
often obliged in the Service of the 
State, to be exposed to the Badness 
or Weather, to the Fatigues of 
Travelling, and to Eat whatever 
he can meet with. This cannot be 
denied; but then I maintain, That 
these things will never hasten a 
Man's Death, provided he that is 
in this Post, accustoms himself to a 
|P_33
frugal way of Living. There is 
no Man, in what condition so- 
ever he is, but may prevent his 
Over-eating; and cure himself of 
those Distempers that are caused by 
Repletion. They who have the 
charge of publick Affairs commit- 
ted to their Trust are more obliged 
to it than any others: Where there is 
no Glory to be got for their Coun- 
try, they ought not to Sacrifice 
themselves: They should preserve 
themselves to serve it, and if they 
pursue my Method, it is certain 
they would ward off the Distem- 
pers which Heat, and Cold, and 
Fatigues might bring upon them; 
or should they be disturbed with 
them, it would be but very lightly. 

It may likewise be Objected, 
That if one who is Well is Dieted 
like one that is Sick, he will be at a 
loss about the choice of his Diet 
when any Distemper comes upon 
|P_34
him. To this I say, That Nature 
which preserves all Beings as far as 
possible, teaches us how we ought 
to govern our selves in such a case. 
It begins by depriving us altogether 
of our Appetite, that we can Eat 
little or nothing at all. At that 
time, whether the Sick Person has 
been Sober or Intemperate, no 
other Food ought to be made use of, 
but such as is proper for the con- 
dition wherein he is; such as Broth, 
Jellies, Cordials, Barley-Water, 
&c. When his Recovery will per- 
mit him to make use of a more solid 
Nourishment, he must take less 
than he was used to before his Sick- 
ness, and notwithstanding the ea- 
gerness of his Appetite, he must 
take care of his Stomach till he has 
a perfect Cure. Should he do o- 
therwise, he would overburden Na- 
ture,and infallibly relapse into the 
danger from whence he escaped. 
But notwithstanding this I dare to 
|P_35
aver, That he who leads a Sober 
and Regular Life will hardly ever 
be Sick; or if he is, it will be but 
seldom, and for a short time. This 
way of Living preserves us from 
those Humours which occasion our 
Infirmities, and by consequence 
heals us of all those Distempers 
which they engender. The defect 
of the Cause does Physically pre- 
vent the production of the Effect, 
and the Effect cannot be dangerous 
and violent, when the Cause it self 
is but slight and weak. 

Since then Sobriety lays a re- 
straint upon our Passions, preserves 
our Health, and is both Wholsome 
and Beneficial to us, ought it not 
to be followed and embraced by all 
Men? Self-love if well understood 
advises us to it: It is neither im- 
possible nor difficult, and the me- 
thod I take ought to discourage no 
body from undertaking it. For I 
do not pretend to persuade every 
|P_36
body to Eat as little as I do, or to 
debar themselves from the use of a 
great many things from which I 
refrain. I Eat but little, because 
my Stomach is nice, and I abstain 
from certain Dishes because they 
are prejudicial to me. They who 
are not offended by them, are not 
obliged to refrain from them, but 
are allowed the use of them; only 
they ought to abstain from eating 
too much even of that which agrees 
with them, because it would be pre- 
judicial to them, since an overcharg'd 
Stomach cannot so easily digest it. In 
short, he that is offended at nothing 
has no occasion of enquiring into 
the Quality of his Diet, he ought 
only to be cautious of the Quantity 
thereof. 

It signifies nothing to tell me, 
That there are several who denying 
themselves nothing, do yet live as 
long without Infirmities, as they 
|P_37
who are Sober. This is but rare, 
uncertain, hazardous, and in a 
manner Miraculous. The instan- 
ces of this nature do not at all justi- 
fie the Conduct of those Persons, 
who reckon it an extraordinary 
Happiness, and are commonly the 
Betrayers of their good Constituti- 
on. It is more certain, that an infirm 
Old Man will live longer by obser- 
ving a strict Regimen, than a 
Young, Vigorous, and Healthful 
Man will, that gives the loose to 
his Appetite. 

However, this is certain, That a 
good Constitution, with the support 
of a Regular Life, will carry a Man 
farther than a weak one, though 
managed with an equal degree of 
Care. God and Nature may form 
bodies so strong and robust, as to 
be proof against all that is contrary 
to us; as I have observed at Venice
the Procurator Thomas Matarini, 
and at Padua the Chevalier Antonio 
|P_38
Capo di Vacca; but among a thou- 
sand one shall hardly meet with the 
like. All others who are for a 
Long and Healthful Life, who 
would Die without an Agony and 
only by a pure Dissolution, who 
would, lastly, enjoy the Advanta- 
ges of a happy Old Age, will ne- 
ver come to what they aim at, with- 
out Sobriety. 

'Tis Temperance alone which 
supports our Constitution without 
any Alteration; it creates nothing 
but sweet and wholsome Humours, 
which sending up no Vapours to 
the Brain, leave the Mind in the 
perfect use of the Organs, and are 
no hindrance from raising its Con- 
templation from the Wonders of 
the World, to the Consideration of 
the Power of its Creator. A Man 
can be never the better for those 
Reflections, when his Head is full 
of the Vapours of Wine and Meat. 
|P_39
But when once these Fumes are 
gone, his Understanding is clear, 
he observes and discerns a thousand 
agreeable things, which he would 
not have known or comprehended 
in another State. He can then di- 
scern the falsity of those pleasures 
which Voluptuousness promises, 
the Real Goods with which Vertue 
loads us, and the Unhappiness of 
those whom a fatal delusion renders 
Slaves to their Passions. 

The three most dangerous are 
the Pleasure of the Taste, the 
hunting after Honours, and the 
possession of Riches. These De- 
sires increase with the Age of 
Old Men, who having always led 
a disorderly Life, have suffer'd their 
Lusts to take Root in their Youth 
and Manhood. A Wise Man does 
not stay so long before he corrects 
them; he declares betimes a War 
against his Passions, of which he 
|P_40
does not obtain the Mastery till 
after several struggles, and then 
Vertue in its turn Triumphs, and 
crowns the Man with the Blessings 
of Heaven and the Esteem of all 
the World. 

Is he ready to pay the Tribute 
that is due to Nature? Full of ac- 
knowledgments for the favours al- 
ready received from God, he throws 
himself into the Arms of his future 
Mercy. He is not afraid of those 
Everlasting Punishments, which 
they deserve, who by their Intem- 
perance offer violence to their own 
Lives. He dies without complain- 
ing, because he was not to live for 
ever; and his Reason sweetens the 
Bitterness of this Fatality: In a 
word, he leaves the world gene- 
rously, when in a long tract of 
Happy years he has had time e- 
nough to enjoy his Vertue and Re- 
putation, and considers that not 
|P_41
one in a thousand who have lived 
otherwise than he has done, has ar- 
rived to such an Age. 

He is comforted the more upon 
considering that this Separation will 
not be violent, painful or feverish. 
His End is Calm, and he expires 
like a Lamp when the Oil is spent, 
no Delirium, no Convulsions attend- 
ing him; and so he passes from this 
Corruptible Life to that whose 
Eternal Happiness is the Reward of 
the Virtuous. 

O Happy, blessed, and regular 
Life, how worthy art thou of our 
Esteem, and how dost thou deserve 
to be preferr'd before thy Contrary? 
We need only reflect upon the dif- 
ferent Effects of both to be sensible 
of the Advantages that attend thee, 
tho' thy name alone is sufficient to 
attract that Esteem which thou De- 
servest. 

|P_42
Having thus given the Reasons 
which made me abandon an Intem- 
perate and take up with a sober Life 
as also the Method I observed in it, 
and the Benefit which I reap'd from 
it, and the Advantage which others 
may receive from the practice there- 
of, I shall now direct my Discourse 
to those who suppose it to be no 
benefit to grow Old, because they 
fancy that when a Man is past se- 
venty his Life is nothing but Weak- 
ness, Infirmity and Misery. In 
the first place, I can assure them that 
they are mightily mistaken, and that 
I find my self, as Old as I am, 
which is much beyond what they 
speak of, to be in the most pleasant 
and delightsom Stage of Life. 

To prove that I have reason for 
what I say, they need only enquire 
how I spend my time, what are my 
usual Pleasures and Business, and 
to hear the Testimony of all those 
|P_43
that know me. They will unani- 
mously testifie that the Life I lead 
is not a dead and languishing Life, 
but as happy an one as can be 
wish'd for in this World. 

They will tell you that I am 
still so strong at fourscore and three, 
as to mount a Horse without any 
Help: That I can not only go 
down Stairs without any concern, 
but likewise descend a Hill all on 
foot: That I am always merry, 
always pleased, always in humour, 
maintaining a happy peace in my 
own Mind, the sweetness and sere- 
nity whereof appear at all times in 
my Countenance. 

Besides, they know that 'tis in 
my Power to pass away the time 
very pleasantly, having nothing to 
hinder me from tasting all the plea- 
sures of an agreeable Society with 
several persons of parts and worth. 
When I am willing to be alone, I 
|P_44
read good Books, and sometimes 
fall to Writing, seeking always an 
occasion of being useful to the pub- 
lick, and doing service to private 
persons as far as possible. I do all 
this without the least trouble; and in 
such times as I set apart for these 
Employments. 

I dwell in a House, which besides 
its being situated in the pleasantest 
part of Padua, may be look'd upon 
as the most convenient and most 
agreeable Mansion of that City. I 
there make me Apartments proper 
for the Winter and Summer, which 
serve as a shelter to defend me from 
the Extreme Heat of the One, and 
the Rigid Coldness of the other. 
I walk out in my Gardens along 
my Canals and Walks, where I 
always meet with some little thing 
or other to do, which at the same 
time employs and diverts me. 

I spend the Months of April, 
May, September and October at my 
|P_45
Country-House, which is in the 
finest Situation imaginable. The 
Air of it is Good, the Avenues 
Neat, the Gardens magnificent, 
the Waters clear and plentiful; 
and this Seat may well pass for 
an inchanted Palace. When I am 
there, I sometimes divert my self 
with a sport that agrees most with 
my Age viz. in going out with 
a setting Dog or with Terriers. 

Sometimes I take a walk to my 
Villa, all whose Streets terminate 
at a large Square, in the midst of 
which is a pretty neat Church, and 
large enough for the bigness of 
the Parish. 

Through this Villa runs a Rivu- 
let, and the Country about is enrich'd 
with fruitful and well cultivated 
Fields, having at present a con- 
siderable number of Inhabitants. 
This was not so anciently; it was a 
Marshy Place, and the Air so bad, 
|P_46
that it was more proper for Frogs 
and Toads, than for Men to dwell 
in. I thought it advisable to drain the 
the Marish-Lands, so that being dry, the 
Air became more wholesome: Seve- 
ral Families have settled there and 
rendred the place very populous, 
where I may say that I have dedi- 
cated to the Lord a Church, Altars, 
and Hearts to Worship him; which 
Reflection is a great Comfort to me 
as often as I make it. 

Sometimes I pay a Visit to my 
Friends, of the Neighbouring 
Towns, who procure me an ac- 
quaintance with the Ingenious 
Men of the place. I discourse 
with them about Architecture, 
Painting, Sculpture, Mathematicks 
and Agriculture; Sciences for 
which I had all my Life long a 
great fondness, and the rather, be- 
cause they were very much in 
esteem in my Time. 

|P_47
I see with Curiosity the new 
pieces of Workmanship; and it 
was a new Pleasure to me to take a 
second View of those which I had 
already seen; and I am always learn- 
ing something that I am pleased to 
know. 

I visit publick Buildings, Palaces, 
Gardens, Antiquities, Squares, 
Churches, and Fortifications, pas- 
sing by no place that may gratifie 
my Curiosity, or give me any new 
Light into things. 

 That which charm'd me most 
in the little Journeys I took, was 
the Various Prospects of Pla- 
ces through which I went. The 
Plains, the Hills, the Rivulets, 
the Castles and the Villages, were 
as so many Objects that offer'd 
themselves with pleasure to my 
Sight; and afforded a delightful 
View. 

|P_48
In short, the Pleasures I take 
are not imperfect upon the account 
of the Weakness of my Organs. 
I see and hear as well as ever I did 
in my Life: All my Senses are as 
free and as perfect as ever, especi- 
ally my Taste, which is better with 
that little which I eat at present, 
than when I was a Slave to my 
Appetite. 

Changing of Beds is no hinder- 
ance to my repose, I sleep very 
soundly; and if I Dream, my 
Dreams are pleasant. 

'Tis with a great deal of satis- 
faction that I see the End of a 
Work of such Importance to this 
State, which has rendred so many 
places fertile, that before were un- 
cultivated and useless; a thing I 
never expected to have seen com- 
pleated, considering how many 
States are loth to begin and wea- 
ry of carrying on Undertakings of 
so vast a Charge and so Difficult to 
|P_49
be perform'd. I was upon the 
places for two Months together 
with the Commissaries that had 
the oversight of these works, and 
this during the greatest Heat of 
Summer; and yet, thanks to 
my Regimen, the only preserver 
of my Health, neither the un- 
wholesome Air of the Fens, 
nor the Fatigue did me any Injury. 

Such as these are the Employ- 
ments and Diversions of my Old 
Age, which is, blessed be God, 
free from those disturbances of 
Mind and Infirmities of Body, 
under which so many poor Rheu- 
matick and crazy Old Men, as 
well as miserable young Men la- 
bour. 

If in discoursing on such a seri- 
ous Subject as this, it be allowable 
to speak of Trifles, I might tell 
you that at the Age of fourscore 
and three, a sober Life had pre- 
|P_50
serv'd me in that Sprightliness of 
Thought, and Gaiety of Humour, as 
to be able to compose a Play for the 
use of the Stage, which was divert- 
ing without shocking the Audience. 
Comedy is usually the product of 
Youth, as Tragedy is of old Age, 
The latter by the Gravity of its 
composure suiting to Riper Years, 
whilst the former by its facetious- 
ness is more agreeable to those that 
are Young. If Antiquity has so 
far commended and admired a 
Greek Poet, for having in the se- 
venty third Year of his Age com- 
pos'd a Tragedy, which is a grave 
and serious Poem, why should I be 
less admir'd and happy in having 
compos'd a Comedy, which is di- 
verting at my Age? For this I am 
sure of, that tho' that Author was 
ten Years younger than I am, yet 
he had not more health, nor a 
brisker Genius. 

|P_51
To conclude, as an Addition to 
my Happiness, I see my self as it 
were immortalized, and born a- 
gain by the great Number of my 
Descendants. I meet with not on- 
ly two or three when I come home, 
but eleven Grand-children, the 
Eldest of which is Eighteen, and 
the Youngest two Years Old, all 
born of the same Father, and the 
same Mother; all healthful, of good 
parts, and of promising hopes. 
I take a delight in playing with the 
Youngsters; Children between 
three and five Years of Age being 
generally very merry and diverting 
Company. Those who are older 
entertain me better: I often make 
them sing and play upon Musi- 
cal Instruments, and sometimes I 
joyn in Consort with them. 

Call you this an infirm and crazy 
Old Age, as they pretend, who say 
that a Man is but half alive after 
he is seventy? They may believe 
|P_52
me if they please, but in reality I 
would not change my Age and Life 
for the most flourishing Youth 
which lays no Restraint upon its 
Senses, being sure that it is subject 
to a great many Distempers which 
may occasion Death. 

I remember all the Follies that I 
was Guilty of in my young Days 
and am perfectly sensible of the 
Danger and Imprudence of them. 
I know with what Violence Young 
Persons are carri'd away by their Pas- 
sions, and how much they presume 
upon their Strength, but would 
think they had taken a sure Lease 
of their Life; they expose it rash-
ly, as if it were chargeable to them
and they run headlong into what-
soever their Concupiscence prompts
them to. They must gratifie their
Appetites whatever it costs them, 
without perceiving that they feed
those ill Humours which will render
|P_53
their Lives miserable, and hasten 
the hour of their Death. 

Of these two, the one is Cruel; 
the other dreadsul and insupport- 
able by all sensual Men, especially 
young people, who suppose they 
have a better Title to Life than 
others, and Libertines who are not 
so Blind as to flatter themselves 
that God will permit their sin to 
go unpunish'd. 

As for my part, blessed be God, 
I find my self freed from those just 
fears which cannot but Alarm them 
whenever they are capable of Re- 
flexion. For in the first place I 
am certain that I shall not fall Sick, 
since I take care by a Regular Diet 
to ward off Infirmities. And then 
secondly, the Time of my Death 
approaching teaches me to submit 
quietly to that which is Inevitable, 
and from which no man could ever 
secure himself. 'Tis folly to be a- 
fraid of that which cannot be a- 
|P_54
voided; but I hope whenever the 
Time comes, the Merits of Jesus 
Christ will be available to me; and 
tho I am sensible that I must die, 
yet I am perswaded it will be a 
long time 'ere I shall, since this 
Dissolution cannot happen but by 
the Consumption of the Radical 
Moisture which is exhausted by 
Age. 

The Regular Life which I lead 
has left Death this only way of de- 
stroying me. The Humours of 
my Body can do me more injury 
than the Elementary Qualities 
which prevail'd in my Nature ever 
since my Birth. I am not so stupid 
as not to perceive, that having had 
a beginning, I must of necessity 
have an End; but since we must 
die, doubtless that Death is attend- 
ed with less Terror which happens 
by the Natural Dissolution of the 
parts of which we are composed. 
Nature her self having tyed the 
|P_55
Bands of our Life, can likewise untie 
them again without the least pain, 
and can stay longer before it executes 
that Office than Sicknesses generally 
do, which with Violence break the 
Bands of our Life asunder, and which 
cannot happen to us but by foreign 
Causes, since nothing is more con- 
trary to Nature than that which 
tends to our Destruction. 

When a Man draws near his 
End, he perceives his Strength to 
abate by Degrees; The Organs 
and all the Faculties grow weak; 
he can no longer Walk, and can 
hardly Speak; His Judgment and 
Memory fail him: He becomes 
blind, deaf, and bowed together; 
in fine, his whole frame is worn 
out. Blessed be God, I am not as 
yet in that Condition. On the 
Contrary I promise my self, that 
my Soul finds its self so well in my 
Body, where she meets with no- 
|P_56
thing but Peace, Unity and Con- 
cord (spite of all the different 
Qualities of the Humours which 
compose us, and the various In- 
clinations that are produc'd by the 
Senses) that she will be under no 
temptation to wish a speedy Sepa- 
ration, and that it will be a long time 
before she can be brought to such 
a Resolution. 

To conclude, I am assur'd that 
I shall still live several Years in 
Health, and that I shall long enjoy 
the pleasure of being in the World, 
which is certainly very comfort- 
able, when a Man knows how to 
make a right use of it. I hope to 
reap a greater Satisfaction from 
hence in the other Life, and I shall 
lie under Obligations to the Virtues 
of the Regimen, to which I am 
indebted for the Victory I have ob- 
tain'd over my Passions. Nor is 
there any Man but what may hope 
|P_57
for the same Happiness, if he 
would live as I have done. 

A sober Life therefore being so 
necessary, its Name so commend- 
able, the Enjoyment of it so bene- 
ficial, nothing remains after what 
has been said, but to conjure all Men 
as they love themselves to make the 
best of life, and lay in a stock of that, 
which being the most precious of 
all, deserves to be sought after if 
we have it not, and to be preserved 
if we have it. 

'Tis this Divine Sobriety which 
is always pleasing to God, and al- 
ways the Friend of Nature; she is 
the Daughter of Reason, the Sister 
of all other Vertues, the Compa- 
nion of Temperance; always 
Chearsul, always Modest, always 
Wise and Regular in in her Operati- 
ons. She is the Root of Health, 
of Industry, and of whatever be- 
|P_58
comes a great Soul to be employ'd 
about. She has the Laws of God and 
Nature, both to justifie and enforce 
her. When she reigns, Repletions Dis- 
orders, Evil Habits, Superfluous Hu- 
mours, Fevers, Aches, and the fears of 
Death, do not disrelish or embitter 
our Pleasures. 

The Happiness of it should in- 
vite us, the Comeliness of it should 
allure us to embrace it. She offers 
to us the Duration of our mortal 
Being: She is the faithful Guardi- 
an of the Life of Man, whether he 
be rich or poor, young or old, or of 
what Sex soever. She teaches the 
Rich not to abuse his Wealth, the 
poor to bear patiently the Inconve- 
niences of his State; She teaches 
the Man Wisdom, the Woman 
Chastity; Old Men the secret of 
putting off their Death, and Young 
Men the means of enjoying a long 
Life. She files the Rust off of our 
|P_59
Senses, renders the Body Vigorous, 
the Mind clear, the Soul lovely; 
gives us a Happy Memory, free 
Motions, and just Actions. 'Tis 
by it that the Mind being disen- 
gaged from Matter enjoys a larger 
Freedom, and the Blood runs 
smoothly in our Veins without 
meeting with any Obstruction in 
its Circulation. 'Tis lastly by it 
that all the Powers both of Soul 
and Body are kept up in a perfect 
Union, which nothing but the 
Contrary Vice can disturb. 

O Sacred and Healthful Sobri- 
ety! The powerful support of our 
Nature! The true Physick of Body 
and Mind! How ought Men to 
praise thee and acknowledge thy 
Benefits, since thou furnishest them 
with the means of attaining Hea- 
ven, and of preserving Life and 
Health here upon Earth! 

|P_60
But not designing to enlarge any 
farther in commendation of this 
Vertue, I shall conclude, keeping 
within the bounds of Sobriety on 
this Subject; not because I have said 
enough of it, but that I may say 
more of it another time. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
|P_61
[}CHAP. II. }]
[}The Method of Correcting a bad 
Constitution. }]
SEveral Persons, whose weak 
Constitution requir'd great 
Care in the Management of it, 
having been well satisfied with 
what I have written concerning 
Sobriety, the Experience which 
they have had of the Usefulness of 
my Counsels, and the acknowledg- 
ments which they have made there- 
of; encourage me to take up my 
Pen again, that I may convince 
those, who meet with no Inconve- 
nience from Intemperance, that 
they are in the wrong in relying 
so much on the strength of their 
Constitution. 

Let it be never so well compos'd, 
yet it holds not good but to such 
|P_62
an Age. These persons seldom 
arrive to Sixty, but they decay all 
of a sudden, and perceive them- 
selves loaded with a Complication 
of Distempers. Some are Gouty, 
Dropsical, and Rheumatical: 
Others are Subject to Cholicks, 
the Stone, and Piles; lastly, to a- 
bundance of Distempers which 
would never have happened to 
them, if they had been so wise as 
to have taken care of themselves 
in their Youth. If they die infirm 
at fourscore Years of Age, they 
might have lived in Health to an 
hundred, and so have run out the 
Term of Life which Nature has 
left open to all Men. 

It is to be supposed that this 
Common Parent wishes that all her 
Children might live at least a Cen- 
tury; and since some among them 
have lived to a longer date, why 
should not others have a Right 
|P_63
of Expecting the same Advan- 
tage? 

I do not disagree but that we 
are subject to the Stars which were 
predominant at our Birth. Their 
good or bad Aspects enfeeble or 
strengthen the Springs of our Life; 
but Man being endued with Judg- 
ment and Reason ought to repair 
by his prudent Conduct the harm 
which his Planet may have done 
him; he may prolong his Days by the 
means of a sober Life to as long a 
period, as if he had been Born very 
strong and lusty. Prudence pre- 
vents and corrects the Malignity of 
the Planets; they give us certain 
inclinations, they carry us out to 
certain passions; but they lay no 
violence upon us, we may resist 
them, and in this sense a Wise 
Man is above the Stars. 

I was born very cholerick and 
hasty; I flew out into a passion for 
|P_64
the least trifle, I huff'd all Mankind, 
and was so intolerable that a great 
many Persons of Repute avoided 
my Company. I apprehended the 
Injury which I did my self; I 
knew that Anger is a real Frenzy; 
that it disturbs our Judgment, that 
it transports us beyond our selves, 
and that the Difference be- 
tween a Passionate and a Mad 
Man is only this, that the latter 
has lost his Reason for ever, and 
the former is only deprived of it 
by Fits. A sober Life cured me of 
this Frenzy; by its Assistance I be- 
came so Moderate and so much a 
Master of my Passion, that no 
Body could perceive that it was 
born with me. 

A Man may likewise with Rea- 
son and a Regular Life correct a 
bad Constitution, and notwith- 
standing the Tenderness thereof 
may live a long time in good health. 
|P_65
I should never have seen forty 
Years, had I followed all my in- 
clinations, and yet I am in the 
Eighty sixth Year of my Age. If 
the long and dangerous Distempers 
which I had in my Youth, had not 
consumed a great deal of the Ra- 
dical Moisture, the loss of which is 
irreparable, I might have promis'd 
my self to have lived a compleat 
Century. But without flattering 
my self, I find it to be a great mat- 
ter to have arrived to forty six 
Years more than I ever expected, 
and that in my Old Age my Con- 
stitution is still so good, that not 
only my Teeth, my Voice, my 
Memory and my Heart are in as 
good a Condition as ever they were 
in the briskest Days of my Youth; 
but likewise my Judgment has lost 
nothing of its clearness and force. 

I am of the Opinion that this 
proceeds from the Abridgment I 
|P_66
make of my Food proportionably 
to my growing into Years. Expe- 
rience, which tells us that Infants 
have a greater Appetite and are 
more often hungry, than grown 
Men, ought likewise to teach us, 
that in Old Age we have less need 
of Nourishment than in the begin- 
ning of our Life. A Man who is 
very Old can hardly eat, because 
he can scarce digest what he eats; 
a little serves his turn, and the 
Yolk of an Egg is a good Meal to 
him. I shall be satisfied therewith 
to the end of my Days, hoping by 
this Conduct neither to dye with 
violence nor with pain, not que- 
stioning but that they who will 
imitate me, will meet with as easie 
an Exit, since we are all of the 
same Species, and made up of the 
same Materials. 

Since nothing then is more ad- 
vantageous for a Man upon Earth 
|P_67
than to live long; He is Obliged to 
preserve his Health as far as pos- 
sible, and this he cannot do with- 
out Sobriety. Tis true indeed, that 
there are several who eat and drink 
plentifully, and yet live to an hun- 
dred Years of Age. 'Tis by their 
Example that others flatter them- 
selves with the hopes of attaining 
to the same Age, without any oc- 
casion of laying a restraint upon 
themselves. But they are in the 
wrong upon these two Accounts: 
First because there is hardly one in 
a thousand, that has so strong a 
Constitution. Secondly, because 
such Men do generally end their 
Lives by such Distempers as put 
them into great Agonies by dying, 
which would never happen to those 
that have the same Government of 
themselves that I have. A Man 
runs the Risque of not attaining to 
fifty Years of Age for not daring 
to undertake a Regular Course of 
|P_68
Life, which is no impossible thing, 
since 'tis what I and several others 
have practised and do practise: 
And a Man becomes insensibly a 
Murderer of himself, because he 
cannot be perswaded that notwith- 
standing the false Charms of a 
Voluptuous Life, a Wise Man 
ought not to look upon it as any 
hardship to put in practice what his 
Reason advises him. 

Reason, if we hearken to it, 
will tell us that a good Regimen 
is necessary for the prolonging of 
our days, and that it consists in 
two things: First, in taking care of 
the Quality; and Secondly, of the 
Quantity, so as to eat and drink no- 
thing that offends the Stomach,
nor any more than what we can 
easily digest. Our Experience ought 
to be our Guide in these two Prin- 
ciples, when we are arrived to forty, 
fifty, or threescore Years of Age. 
|P_69
He who puts in practise that Know- 
ledge which he has of what is good 
for him, and goes on in a frugal way 
of Living, keeps the Humours in a 
just Temperature, and prevents 
them from being altered, tho' he 
suffer Heat and Cold, tho he be fati- 
gued, tho his sleep be broke, provided 
there be no Excess in any of them. 
This being so, what an Obligation 
does a Man lie under of living so- 
berly? And ought he not to free 
himself from the fears of sinking 
under the least Intemperature of the 
Air, and under the least Fatigue, 
which make us sick upon every 
slight occasion? 

'Tis true indeed, the most so- 
ber may sometimes be indisposed, 
when they are unavoidably obliged 
to trangress the Rule which they 
have been used to Observe; but 
then they are certain that their In- 
disposition will not last above two 
|P_70
or three days at most; nor can they 
fall into a Fever. Weariness and 
Faintness are easily remedied by 
Rest and good Diet. The Malig- 
nancy of the Stars cannot put the 
Malignant Humours in a ferment, 
in Bodies which have them not: 
Tho' Distempers which proceed 
from Intemperance have an Internal 
Cause, and may be dangerous; 
those which are derived from the 
Influences of the Planets, affect us 
only externally, and cannot produce 
any great Disorders.
