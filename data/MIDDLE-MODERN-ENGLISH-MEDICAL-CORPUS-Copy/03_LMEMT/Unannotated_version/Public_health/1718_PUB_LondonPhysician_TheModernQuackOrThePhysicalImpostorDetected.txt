[}The Argument. }]
[}That there can be no Safety in relying upon 
any Remedy left up and down the Town to 
sell at Tradesmen's Shops, and publish'd by 
Bills dispersed for that Purpose, or Adver- 
tisements in the Prints; the same being 
usually made up by ignorant People, who 
themselves know not their real Use; or by 
profess'd Quacks, who for base and sordid 
Lucre only, expose and set the same to Sale. }]AS the Medicinal Profession 
upon Account of the Sub- 
ject about which it is em- 
ploy'd, has been at all 
times reckon'd the most 
useful; so, by reason of the 
profound Judgment, as particularly by 
the Dissection of Humane Bodies, to be 
|P_2
inform'd throughly of the exact Scituation, 
the Nature and Uses of the several Parts, 
with as diligent an Enquiry into the se- 
veral Properties and Vertues, as well of 
simple as compounded Medicaments, 
also the Manner of their Operation 
when taken into our Bodies: For these 
Reasons, I say, it has been thought too 
the most difficult of all others to be ac- 
quir'd; and therefore the great Profi- 
cients therein, have, by the Learned, 
been usually, and deservedly, above all 
others, highly honour'd and esteem'd, 
even deify'd by some of the Antients. 
Yet notwithstanding all this, if we sur- 
vey the Qualifications of some pretending 
to this noble Profession, a Man would 
be apt to think it the easiest of all 
others; or that little else was thereto 
wanting but the Name of a Disease, 
without its Definition, and the turning 
over some Receipt-Book to find something 
there enter'd, as a Remedy for the 
same. 

That this is now the Foundation of 
some Peoples Knowledge who stile them- 
selves Physicians, and are vulgarly also 
call'd Doctors, is no very difficult Matter 
to make appear; from whence I think 
the Consequence is as easy, That there 
can be no Safety in taking such Reme- 
|P_3
dies, which they set thus to Sale, as other 
sorts of Merchandize or Trading Com- 
modities. 

Having made it my Business to get the 
best Intelligence I could, of the Authors 
of these Medicines, as well as of the Me- 
dicines themselves, I found some of them 
were profess'd Quacks, or sorry Chymists, 
both alike ignorant in the Practice of Phy- 
sick. Others simple Tradesmen, and foo- 
lish but bold Women. Others again from 
some Family Receipt, many Years toge- 
ther handed down as some Sacred Re- 
lique, by way of Tradition, and kept with- 
in their own Walls, as they will tell you, 
for many Ages, till at length falling to the 
Share of one unwilling the mighty Trea- 
sure should be longer conceal'd, or rather 
for turning the Penny [which is termed 
the publick Good] the same is expos'd, 
with some hard Name, and a large Cata- 
logue of its admirable Virtues. Others, 
lastly, transfer'd from some Physical Pre- 
script on the Apothecary's File, or borrow- 
ed directly from the Dispensatory, with a 
Foreign Title, that [like other Things, far 
fetch'd and dearly paid for] it may please 
the better. This Charge will be still far- 
ther made appear, when I come presently 
to enquire into the Nature of these Reme- 
dies; in the mean time I will appeal to 
|P_4
all Persons of a common Capacity, whe- 
ther it be reasonable to venture their Lives 
[as too many of them do] upon so despe- 
rate and weak a Bottom. 

If an idle Mechanick, or other Trades- 
man, having run out his Substance, and 
not caring to Work at his proper Occupa- 
tion, procuring a Dispensatory, or some 
other Physick Book in his Mother Tongue, 
shall thereby understand, that Gamboge, 
as it is called, and Elaterium, or the Juice of 
the Wild Cucumber, are the most powerful 
Remedies to cure a Dropsy; that the Root 
of Bryony will do the same; that Hellebore
is good for Melancholy, or Mad-People; 
Mountain-Flax for the Gout and Rheuma- 
tism; that Coloquintida, or the Bitter Apple
will do mighty Feats for young Women; 
that Mercury will cure the French Pox; 
Opium give Ease; and the Glas of Anti- 
mony [so call'd] will Vomit, and the like 
of sundry others dispers'd up and down 
in Physick Books: If, I say, such a Per- 
son as this shall set about [as perhaps the 
same Book may instruct him] the making 
of Extracts or Electuaries, Pills, Tinctures, 
or Elixirs, giving each of them some 
cramp Name, much more if he shall 
deliver them out as he buys them 
at the Druggists Shop, what is it 
that he may not accomplish! I would 
|P_5
say, What Mischief is he not qualified 
to perpetrate? when, perhaps, the over- 
poise of the Scale is sufficient to do Exe- 
cution upon some, and a Dose impropor- 
tionate, to kill the stoutest Man in the 
Kingdom. At the best, if any Good can 
be done [as it may sometimes happen] 
it is like ten or twenty People's falling 
down a Precipice, where one or two only 
have the Luck to escape, and that not by 
their own Skill or Foresight, so much as 
some unforeseen Incident in their Favour. 

If it be here objected, that you do not 
hear of many such Mischiefs befalling 
those who have bought these Remedies? I 
will readily allow the one half of them 
to be of such a Nature, as to do you nei- 
ther Harm nor Good; and these seem 
only levell'd at your Pockets; whilst o- 
thers are often found more dangerous to 
the Experimenters thereof. Thus, I ob- 
serve, among the Delinquents formerly 
call'd to Account, and punish'd for such 
like Crimes, one John Not, and divers 
others, were Fin'd and Imprison'd for having 
kill'd sundry Persons, with one or other of 
the before-mention'd dangerous Medicines. 
Thomasine Scarlet, with other Women, 
for tampering with Mercurial and Antimonial 
Remedies, by which others were miserably tor- 
mented, and many destroy'd. William For- 
|P_6
rester, a Priest, Simon Foreman, a pre- 
tended Astrologer, and one Trig a Shoe- 
maker, but desperate bold Empirick, for the 
like Evil and fatal Practices with some Chi- 
mical Preparations. Another for giving Co- 
loquintida, another Elaterium, by which 
some Persons were murther'd as it were 
upon the Spot. Another Priest, one Evans
by Name, was Prosecuted and Imprison'd, 
for that it was proved, instead of preaching 
the Gospel, he had run out of his Province 
and kill'd several Persons with his Antimonial 
Cup; and least you should think our present 
Medicine-makers more honest, a late Au- 
thor has inform'd us upon his own Know- 
ledge, That a great Parcel of the coursest and 
foulest Horse-Aloes were even seen, and had 
been refused by several Farriers for fear of 
mischiefing their Beasts, was bought up by one 
of these wretched People, and made into Pills, 
left to sell at several Places for the most use- 
ful Purge and suited to all Diseases and 
Constitutions: Under the fatal Operation 
of some of which, I have seen my self 
three several Persons destroy'd miserably, 
and many more, with the utmost hazard 
of their Lives, escaping. 

Indeed, were the Physicians Province 
so very easy as these Empirics would in- 
duce the People to believe, and that 
there was nothing more necessary than to 
|P_7
find a Name for their Distempers, a Re- 
medy [no matter what] call'd now a- 
days a Specifick, is always ready at hand; 
for which, instead of applying to Physi- 
cians, we need but look into the News- 
Papers, and there we have plenty of all 
sorts, let the Grievance be where it will, 
even from the falling of the Hair on the 
Top of the Head, to the Corns upon the 
Soles of our Feet or Toes. 

And thus for the Diseases of the Head
and Brain, we have Cephalick Tinctures
and Head Pills of divers kinds: Apoplectick 
Spirits and Balsams; Vapour Drops, and 
Drops for the Palsy and Convulsions; for 
the Eyes, we have Salves and Waters with- 
out Number, some of them as far fetch'd 
as Jerusalem, tho' they never travell'd per- 
haps a Mile from the Exchange; not for- 
getting the Goody Cater the Oyster-Woman's 
most excellent Oyntment, reveal'd to her 
Husband's great Grand-father in a Dream; 
for the Ears we have Drops for Deafness; 
for the Tooth-ach, Tinctures, &c. and to 
whiten them Dentifrices, or Powders from 
Morocco, China, and Japan; for the Mouth, 
Gargles and Washes, many; for the whole 
Face and Hands, Chymical Washballs, be- 
sides Pearls, Cream Balls, White-Pots, and 
Custards, some from Rome and Italy, o- 
thers from Venice. You see how far these 
|P_8
good People travel even for Remedies to 
remove Freckles and clean our Faces. 
Come we now to the Breast, and here we 
have Lozenges in every Corner for our 
Coughs and Colds, Tinctures and Elixirs for 
the Lungs; Tinctures likewise to sweeten 
the Breath, and for the Phthisick, and 
Asthma; Cordials of all sorts for the Heart, 
and Rectificators of our Vitals, which if 
we believe the Quack Authors Account, 
will supply the Place of all other Reme- 
dies whatever, being Specifical to the 
whole Body, as well as to particular Parts. 
Shall we descend lower, and view the Dis- 
eases of the Stomach, Spleen, Liver, Womb, 
Kidneys and Bladder? and here we have 
the Elixir Mag. Stom. with several Re- 
finers thereupon; Pills, Powders and Tin- 
ctures, great Variety, for all sorts of Ob- 
structions; to drive away Melancholy from 
the Spleen, we have the Hypo-Drops; for 
the Stone, whether in the Reins or Bladder, 
we have Powders, Tinctures, Distill'd Wa- 
ters, Volatile Cleansers, and Dissolution 
Salts; for Cholick and Gripes, Spirits, Tin- 
ctures, Waters, Pills, Elixirs, and what 
not, some to ease us in a quarter of an 
Hour, others in half a Quarter; but why 
should we stay so long, when others will 
do the Feat in a Minute, especially if 
taken with a good round Dose of Geneva
|P_9
or of Lovage, called otherwise their Gripe- 
Water; for Worms we have Purging Ta- 
blets, or to tempt the poor Infant, often- 
times to its Destruction, the Purging 
Sugar Plumbs: And to compleat this My- 
stery of Iniquity, if we want Heirs to our 
Estates, there are Vivifying Drops for Bar- 
renness, not to mention some other pecu- 
liar Remedies suited to the Weaknesses or 
Infirmities of one kind or other, belong- 
ing to the Fair Sex. 

But farther, if we take a view of other 
Disorders, more generally supposed to 
have their Residence in our Blood and Hu- 
mours, we are here likewise amply fur- 
nish'd. In Acute Distempers we have Re- 
medies for Fevers of other kinds, as well 
as for the Measles and Small-Pox. For Chro- 
nical, or more tedious ones, as the Scurvy
[which, by the way is a Name we use 
for almost all Distempers that we know 
not what to make of] there are Elixirs, 
Spirits, Waters, Electuaries, and some o- 
thers; for the Gout [that Disgrace to Phy- 
sicians] we have a Coal-heaver's Decoction, 
an Old-Woman's Plaister and Oyntment, a 
Tarpaulin's East India Oyl, besides the A- 
tyla of a Quacking Surgeon, and twenty 
of the same Goodness, i. e. good for no- 
thing but to cheat Men, some of their 
Money, and others of their Lives; for 
|P_10
the Leprosy, a late Chymical Spirit, first 
Cosin to King Atyla aforesaid; for the 
Itch, Washes, Oyntments, Girdles, all very 
safe, and harmless as the rankest Poyson, 
which too many, without any Prepara- 
tion of their Bodies, running upon Head- 
long, have wofully experienc'd. But to 
proceed; we have Consumptions of all 
sorts pluck'd up by the Roots: we have the 
King's- Evil cur'd by that eminent Physico- 
Chyrurgical Parson, the Chast, Honest, and 
Pious Mr. V—s the C—y-M—n, 
who has told you at least once a Week 
for these eight or ten Years [least you 
should forget him] that he lives in S— 
L—; lastly, to bring up the Rear of 
this Rascally Regiment, you have Mother 
Bedlicot's Drink for the Dropsy and Jaun- 
dice; she, good Woman, used to open the 
Pews at St. Sepulchres, when she could 
spare time from visiting her Patients, and 
always took care that upon her Demise, 
the Secret should descend lineally to the 
next Heir, who I am told has the noble 
Legacy now in Possession. 

It would be almost endless to enume- 
rate the Remedies these honest Folks have 
invented to ease us, I should say to pick 
our Pockets, and therefore I shall quit my 
Hands of them for the present, after I have 
acquainted you with what is very neces- 
|P_11
sary [being a principal part of the Bait] 
that at the Head of each of these Reme- 
dies, I find some very inviting Term, 
such as Angelical, Royal, Incomparable, O- 
doriferous, [tho' that implies no more than 
a Sir—ce] Specifick, [which is now 
become the universal Epithet, if it were 
but for a Remedy for broken-winded or 
founder'd Horses; so that in a little time 
we shall doubless have Specificks to kill Rats 
and Mice (about which their Time and 
Medicines would be better employ'd) as 
there are already for Lice and Fleas] and 
most of them Admirable, Infallible, or 
Never-failing. 

Upon summing up this Bill of Fare, I 
found I had left out one of the most ma- 
terial Dishes serv'd up at this Physical 
Banquet, I mean the All-Sovereign or 
most Famous Anodyne Necklace for Chil- 
drens Teeth, [you see the Generosity of 
these good People extends even to our 
Infants as well as our selves] prepar'd 
out of St. Hugh's Bones. Now you must 
know, this St. Hugh [mistake me not, 
I do not mean that St. Hugh that lies neg- 
lected up and down in the Coblers-Stalls] 
was a great Lover of young Children, used 
to dandle them in his Lap, smack his Fingers 
and sing to them; and finding them pain'd 
in their Teeth, he would dip his Finger in 
|P_12
Holy Water, and so going gently over their 
Gums nine times, upon removing his said 
Finger the last time, presently popt out the 
Tooth; he had, moreover, great Virtue in 
the same Finger in crossing the Forehead three 
times [for you must know there lies great 
stress upon an odd Number] to drive away 
the Head-ach, and the like upon the Bellies of 
Women in Labour to forward their Delivery. 
Upon all which Considerations, after his 
Decease, the good Man being Sainted, 
the Women came far and near to worship 
at his Tomb, with their Children when 
in danger from their Teeth; the great 
Belly'd for an easy Travel; and the Bar- 
ren [for they had no Vivifying Drops in 
those Days] that they might conceive. 

Now it happen'd, that a young Lady 
having been long Married to an ancient 
Knight [we must not tell their Names] 
and without Children, sitting pensively 
one Summer Evening in her Garden, 
this St. Hugh appears, tells her who he 
was, that he knew her Wants, and that 
if she came to Chapel the same Even- 
ing, and Vespers being over, conceal'd her- 
self in such a part thereof till the Peo- 
ple were all gone out, he would again 
appear to assist her; but, by the way, 
some say it was a Roguish Fryar that 
|P_13
laid this Stratagem to debauch her; be 
this as it may, to go on with our Le- 
gend, the Lady obeys; St. Hugh comes 
and lies conceal'd in some other part, 
when the Religious being all gone out, 
and the Chapel Doors shut up, our 
Saint coming out of his Hole, accosts 
his Lady, prevails by reason of his 
Sanctity, first telling her he had assum'd 
his Body for this special Work, lies 
with her and retires, as does the abused 
Lady to her Covert till the time of 
Mattins, when Opportunity was given 
for their Release. In short, upon this 
Intercourse with the Holy Father, the 
Lady Conceiv'd, went out her time, 
and by coming daily to St. Hugh's 
Tomb, was deliver'd safely of a Son, who, 
at about nine Months end, being like 
to die with his Teeth, she had a Dream, 
wherein was discover'd to her, that if 
she could procure one of St. Hugh's Toes 
[whether it was the great or little Toe 
truly I forget, but admire it was not 
his Finger that had been used to the 
Work] and rub the Child's Gums 
therewith, it would recover: Upon 
which, not without great Interest 
made [some say by bribing only of 
the Sexton] the Coffin was open'd, 
and the Bone brought, when [com- 
|P_14
mend me to the Romancer] no sooner 
was the same apply'd to the Child's 
Gum, but up starts two great swanking 
Teeth, the Infant presently smiles, and 
grew well at the same Instant; however, 
to prevent danger from any other 
Teeth, the holy Relick being carefully 
wrapt up in a Piece of Silk, was hung 
about little Master's Neck, and he 
thence forwards throve mainly, beyond 
all the Children round about the Coun- 
try, cutting the rest of his Teeth with- 
out a Whimper. 

How it happen'd that these Relicks lay 
undisturb'd so many hundred Years [for 
it is time out of Mind that this St. Hugh
flourish'd] I know not; but so it is, that 
a generous Popish Priest having got the rest 
of the Skeleton into his Possession, has 
brought it over Sea, and [hiring a Turner's 
Garret] work'd the same into Beads for 
Necklaces for the use of the Hereticks Chil- 
dren, that as they grow up, their Faith 
may be strong enough to swallow yet 
greater Delusions intended for them by 
him and his Accomplices. 

Ah England! England! that it ever 
should be said of thee, that even the 
meanest Masters of thy Families [since 
Popery and Superstition have been banish'd 
|P_15
hence] should permit, or the Mistresses
thereof desire, such Childish Trinkets [fit 
only to amuse Ideots or Fools] to be 
brought in, or hung about their Children's 
Necks, in Expectation of Advantage by 
the same? That some of you who scarce 
have Bread to feed them, or Cloaths to 
hide their Nakedness, should yet find 
Money to purchase these Baubles, these 
most absurd and ridiculous Trifles; that 
you should, I say, be perswaded, a piece 
of a dry Stick, or other Vegetable, a 
Stone or a Bone [no matter which or 
what] should be able to send forth such sa- 
lutiferous Emanations, or Steems into the 
Air, which roving up and down in quest of 
some proper Object on which to settle, but, find- 
ing none elsewhere, at length return, and en- 
tering the Mouth or Nostrils, or some more 
secret Passages of the Body, whirl about therein 
with the Blood, find out their Fellows, call a 
Council, and mustering up their Forces, strait 
hasten to relieve the beleaguer'd Gum; here 
some of them with their Pickaxes break 
Ground and sap the same; others lay the Train; 
others blow up the Fortress and make way for 
the imprison'd Tooth; or, if this Allegory be 
thought too Foreign, some of them must 
rarefy or attenuate, others relax and mollify: 
others of them dilate, and, lastly, others must 
incide or Cut, by which, immediate Passage is 
|P_16
now granted for the Eruption. This being 
the Story, I must say, Quis credat? cre- 
dat Judæus, Papista credat. 

Some doubtless, and perhaps justly too, 
may think I have spent too much of my 
Reader's Time in this Burlesque, and that 
there was no need of so much Drollery? 
To which I shall only reply, that Fooleries 
of any kind are sometimes best answer'd 
in the Drolling Way, especially where the 
Argument will not suffer very serious 
handling. 

To such however as have serious Scru- 
ples about this Affair, and shall retort 
Matters of Fact, as they call them, and 
alledge the publick Testimonies in Ad- 
vertisements, which give an Account of 
the great Virtue experienced in these 
Beads; and the Numbers of Children reco- 
ver'd by wearing of the same; Women eased 
in their Labours; others cured of Head-achs, 
Cramps, Convulsions, and the like; to these 
I say I will now seriously make answer, 
and doubt not in the least to prove them 
no other than direct Frauds, and gross 
Impositions upon Ignorant and Credulous 
Persons. 

First then I say, considering the many 
thousands of these Toys that are sold, the 
Number is exceeding small, that we hear, 
|P_17
of those who have pretended any ways 
to Benefit thereby; as one perhaps in one 
hundred. And, Secondly, among these, 
we find the greater part of them misre- 
presented; it being Customary for the 
Cheat, or his Accomplice, to draw up 
the Testimonial, and the People [such as 
can] are to sign or set their Mark, some- 
times to they know not what; as I have 
had it from their own Mouths. Others 
have given Commissions at large to the 
Scout, or Messenger, sent out to pick up 
Informations; and yet the Advertisement
has come forth as if unknown to the Neck- 
lace-Merchant, by way of return of 
Thanks, or rather for a return of their 
Money, very likely with Interest, upon 
Condition of this Liberty of putting 
what they pleased into the News-Paper, 
with a Promise of vouching it, should 
there be any occasion. But, Thirdly, I 
find these Informations have been general- 
ly obtain'd, one way or other, among 
the Meaner, and some of them Necessi- 
tous Persons; or if of better Fashion, 
from Families where the Mother is much 
addicted to Superstition and old Wives Fa- 
bles, and the Father about as Wife, if he 
knows any thing of the Matter. Fourth- 
ly, It is a plain Argument of the great Want 
of New and almost Dayly Advertisements, 
|P_18
[of which they could not stand in need, 
if the Thing it self were not in the Vul- 
gar Phrase, a Bite] for that once in a 
Month, sometimes after three or four, we 
find an old Story trumpt up, as if just 
then fallen out; among some of which, 
finding my self concern'd, I shall here de- 
liver the Case truly. 

A poor Woman brought her Child to 
me, then labouring under what we call 
a Symptomatic Fever; looking into its 
Mouth, I found two of the upper Gums 
full spread, highly inflam'd, and the 
Teeth just ready to break through; how- 
ever, by reason of the Fever and great 
Fluxion, I prescrib'd, among other Re- 
medies, Bleeding, Blistering, and above 
all, that they would send for a Surgeon, 
to cut into the affected Gums, and set at 
Liberty the Teeth, which gave rise to 
this Fever, as I had reason thus to con- 
jecture: But the foolishly fond Mother 
being afraid of the Lancet [the best and 
speediest Remedy at such times] neglects 
this latter Part of the Advice, and whe- 
ther the rest was pursued I know not; 
but few Days after, I heard in the Neigh- 
bourhood, that she had with the simple 
Multitude, purchas'd the famous Anodyne 
Necklace, which had not been worn long, 
before one of the Teeth [just coming out 
|P_19
as I observ'd but now] did cut, soon 
after the other, and the Child grew easier, 
as was to be expected. 

This Tale, by a Scout, was presently 
got hold of, brought in, and drest up 
with all the Formality of a wonderful Re- 
covery, partly true, and partly false; true 
in that the Teeth came out [and so they 
had if the Necklace had never been heard 
of]; false, in that they had taken Advice 
of the whole College of Physicians, of whom 
none but my self was ever consulted, 
and mine [as you have heard, in the 
most material Point, if in any one] not 
follow'd; and all this to magnify the great 
Virtue in St. Hugh's Bones; but observe 
now the Sequel of this Story. 

When this Tale had been often told, and 
worn as it were Thread-bare [by which I 
suppose their Advertisements thereof, were 
well paid for, in bringing more Fools to 
their Market] it happen'd some Months 
after, as if Old Nick owing them a spight 
was now minded as we say to pay them; 
some new Teeth coming out, the Child 
was again brought very low and weak, and 
trusting to the Famous Anodyne Necklace, 
they sought for no other Help, till it was 
too late; when at length, behold, the very 
Day the old Story was advertis'd, and 
drest up to all the Advantage imaginable, 
|P_20
with the Parents return of Thanks, un- 
known to the Author, and such like ful- 
some Lies, the poor Infant expires with 
the Miraculous Beads about its Neck; and 
certainly, unless they had not quite aban- 
don'd all Modesty, as well as common 
Honesty, they would have prudently sup- 
press'd this particular Advertisement for 
the future; yet so shameless and scanda- 
lous do I find them, as to continue this 
very Relation with an additional Piece of 
fine Wire-drawing, viz. That the said 
Child, by Means of the Necklace, is so re- 
cover'd of all his Weakness, that he is 
grown a very fine Boy, ['twas much their 
Hands being in, they had not made a 
Man of him] and can run alone; where- 
as, had themselves sent to enquire, they 
must have known he had been Dead 
[and of his Teeth as I have told you] 
several Months past. 

Many the like Examples I have heard 
of, from Persons of the greatest Credit; 
some of them having curs'd their Credu- 
lity, in suffering themselves to be imposed 
on, and thrown the Popish Trumpery [as 
they then call it] into the Fire. But, 
Lastly, granting all of them to be Facts, 
there needs not many Words to prove 
them of no Force for the End proposed; 
it being certain, that most Children be- 
|P_21
tween seven and twelve Months old, soon- 
er or later, must cut some of their Teeth; 
if now when a Child is indispos'd there- 
by, a Necklace, or any other Toy, is put 
on at the time of its breaking forth, or 
perhaps two or three Days before, this 
Tooth, I say, had inevitably broke thro', 
whether the Beads, or other Toy, had 
been left on or off; and if the Parent had 
written Hocus Pocus, adsis Dens? on a piece 
of Paper, in the stead of the Necklace, 
take my Word, it would have done eve- 
ry jot as much Service, in bringing forth 
the Tooth. 

If they would have the Argument prove 
any Thing, they should prove, that no 
Child, [at least the greater Number] e- 
ver wore it but with some Advantage; 
whereas, on the contrary, there are some 
Scores I have seen with it for several 
Months, pining and languishing to no pur- 
pose, till a Lancet has been admitted, and 
then some of them have recover'd. Others 
meerly by Strength of Nature, not by 
any Efficacy of these Childish Amuse- 
ments, have at last weather'd the Point, 
whilst great Numbers die dayly, in spight 
of St. Hugh's Toes, or his Teeth either; 
but if the few having it on, shall happen 
to cut their Teeth, no Matter, says the 
Impostor, for the thousands that die with 
|P_22
it on, for you are never sent of this Er- 
rand to the Parents of the Dead. 

You will say, perhaps, the Author has 
show'd himself a learned Man, and a 
great Philosopher, proving also that many 
strange Feats may be done by Sympathy, or 
by means of invisible Atoms, Miasms, A- 
porrhæas, Effluvias, Emanations, Exhalati- 
ons, with abundance of hard Words; and 
that Paracelsus, Van Helmont and Sir Kenelm 
Dygby were of the same Opinion; and, last- 
ly, that he has appeal'd to the Royal Society. 

To all which I shall answer as shortly 
as I can; That I take him, indeed, to be 
a very shrewd Man, and that he has 
thrown out as good a Bait for Fools as 
perhaps was ever known in London, and 
prosecutes as likely a Method to carry on 
his Design, which yet is not supported but 
on very large Expence; for no longer than 
he is Piping with his Advertisements, will 
the Fish come to the Bait. 

He has likewise given us a great many 
hard Names, and told us some wonderful 
Stories, some True, which prove Little; 
others False, which prove Nothing, un- 
less that the Author, telling them as Truths, 
is not to be credited in any thing he says. 
Paracelsus and Helmont were both Quacks, 
as himself, yet of much larger Talents in 
the Physical Science; the former, how- 
|P_23
ever a mad Extravagant, the latter a 
whimsical Enthusiast, each, notwithstand- 
ing, of a singular and great Genius; and I 
dare believe in Principle, both Honester 
than himself. Sir Kenelm, a most renown'd 
Personage, a very great Naturalist, but 
no Physician; nor has his Sympathetick
Cure of Wounds any ways vacated or su- 
perseded the Practice of Surgery, [I know 
where it has forty times made Work for 
that Profession] any more than this ridi- 
culous Bead-roll is like to that of Phy- 
sic; they having both of them been suffi- 
ciently prov'd Fallacious and idle Dreams; 
the one however, of an honest and well- 
meaning Nobleman, the other [as it is 
credibly reported] of a knavish and de- 
signing Priest. 

But still you may farther argue, if the 
Project was no better than a Cheat, how 
comes it that Dr. Paul Chamberlen of the 
College of Physicians, should suffer his 
Name to be set, as a kind of Sanction 
thereunto? To this last raised Objection I 
shall answer as tenderly as I can. Dr. 
P. C. [who, by the way, was not a Mem- 
ber of the College] is now gone to his 
Place, and can't answer for himself: nor 
can I for him, any better than that there 
were more Reasons than every body 
knew, why his Name was used to give 
|P_24
Credit, and support this Piece of R—y; 
some of them have been already guest 
at in Print, and his Executors, I dare say, 
can tell yet more. I have already told 
you he is gone, and can say nothing to me, 
and therefore all I shall say more of him 
is this, that when a learned Physician of 
my Acquaintance took him to Task upon 
this Matter, and endeavoured to make 
him sensible of the Scandal to himself as 
well as to the whole Faculty of Physic; 
he put off the Discourse with a Smile, 
saying, The Thing was harmless, and suited 
to the People's Humours; and that if the 
Children, for want of it, could not benefit in 
their Teeth, the Mothers, by the force of 
Fancy, might be eased in their Deliveries; 
and that lastly, it had as much Virtue as any 
other external Remedy of this Nature, which 
the People seem'd extremely fond of ; which 
was [what all the sensible part of Man- 
kind knew before] just none at all; nor I 
dare say [if you will not take my Word 
for it] can you find one Gentleman of the 
Royal Society, that will not readily acknow- 
ledge as much as all I have said amounts 
to. 

|P_25
[}PART II. }]
[}The Argument. }]
That, supposing some of these Remedies were 
at first directed by the most learned Physi- 
cian, and afterwards compounded or pre- 
par'd by an honest Artist, yet in this way of 
their Administration, it cannot otherwise 
fall out, but that many more must be injur'd 
[at least if they are good for any thing] 
than can be benefited thereby. 

THis 2d general Proposition, I ground, 
1. Upon the similitude or likeness of 
one Disease with another; by which, Physicians 
themselves, who have had all Opportunities by 
a View of the Patient, and strict Enquiry in- 
to all Circumstances, have, notwithstanding, 
been sometimes unhappily mistaken. 2. Upon 
the differing Constitutions, as well as differing 
Circumstances of some others, labouring un- 
der the same Distemper, requiring still a di- 
vers Method of Healing. 3. From the same 
Disease, differently circumstantiated one Day, 
perhaps an Hour from what it is the next, 
and quite altering the first Intention. 4. From 
divers Causes giving Rise to the same Di- 
stemper, and which are always to be respected 
carefully by every good Physician. 5. And 
|P_26
lastly, From particular Idiosyncrasy's, a hard 
Word I must confess for a common Reader to 
understand, and which I know not how to ex- 
press otherwise, than its implying something 
in our Natures, by which one Man naturally 
abhors, or loaths, what another is pleased 
with, and so contrarily. 

From some one or more of these 
[which are not all I could enumerate, but 
enough I think to my Purpose] I shall 
here, I say, undertake to evince that you 
run exceeding Hazards, by meddling with 
any Medicine, however good in its kind, 
recommended in this way of Advertise- 
ment, notwithstanding the best printed 
Directions that can be given therewith. 

And for the clearer Representation of 
this Affair, I shall, by way of Demonstra- 
tion, give at least one Example [my in- 
tended Brevity not allowing more] under 
each of the foregoing Heads; and I will 
begin with that very common Disease the 
Cholick: Now this you all know, is a 
Name by which we are apt to signify any 
Pain, whether fix'd or moving, in the 
Stomach or Bowels. It is indeed a Word 
of Latitude, and contains several Species
[if I may be allowed the Expression here] 
under one common Genus; and thus there 
is a Cholick [the most frequent of any 
other] arising from Wind pent up in some 
|P_27
part of the Stomach or Guts. There is a 
Cholick from Cold, Phlegmatick Humours 
also heap'd up and obstructing the same 
Parts. There is a Cholick from what 
Physicians properly enough call Bile or 
yellow Choler, hence nam'd a Bilious 
Cholick, arising from this Humour fer- 
menting with some others in these Parts 
also, and exciting the most cruel Tor- 
ments. Again, there is a Cholick proceed- 
ing from an Inflammation of these Parts, 
attended with very cruel, and often fatal 
Symptoms, as Gangrene and Mortification. 
Farther, there is a Cholick from a Hurry 
and Confusion of the Spirits, rushing as 
it were impetuously upon the Bowels, and 
producing exquisite Pains in the Stomach 
or Guts, with Vomiting sometimes, as in 
a true Cholick: At other times the Pain is 
seated on the Kidneys and Neck of the 
Bladder, which in consult with that ex- 
cellent Physician Dr. Mead, I was once a 
Witness of, occasioning a total Suppressi- 
on of Urine, and putting on the exact 
likeness of a Cholick from the Stone or 
Gravel; and this we call an Hysterick 
Cholick. There is, lastly, a Cholick from 
the said Gravel, which we call the Stone 
Cholick, and which by Consent of Parts, 
in many Symptoms, resembles also the 
common Cholick. 

|P_28
You may object, that albeit there may 
be many Causes of these Cholicks, yet if 
the same Remedy will remove the Com- 
plaint, no matter whether he who sells it, 
can rightly distinguish these several Causes; 
and indeed, if this could be made out, I 
would grant due weight to the Objection; 
but the contrary is most notorious, and by 
this Mistake, abundance of Patients have 
miscarry'd; for tho' many of the Species
have some common Accident or Symptom, 
such as Pain, Vomiting, Costiveness, with 
small or no Fever; others great Heat, 
Thirst, with Fever attending; others, as 
we said just now, with Strangury or stop- 
page of Urine; yet these arising from 
very differing Causes, and producing also 
differing Consequences, must be treated 
therefore in a quite differing Method. 
'Tis own'd they all agree in one common 
Symptom, I mean Pain, implying, as it 
might therefore seem, one common Re- 
medy, viz. some Opiat to take off the 
same. But he who first goes to take off 
this Symptom in some of them, without 
having an Eye to remove the Cause, 
fixes the same deeper, and sometimes 
thereby puts it out of the Power of the 
most suitable Remedy afterwards to re- 
lieve the Sick, who had been thus igno- 
rantly treated. 

|P_29
To explain this Matter a little farther; 
He, who in the Inflammatory, or Bilious 
Cholick, sends for any of the common 
Cholick Waters, [as they are mischievously 
termed] whether the famous J— M—rs, 
the never failing G—s, which is nothing 
else but Lovage Water, the common, and 
now well known Remedy of Daffy; or, 
in a word, a Quartern of Geneva [which 
alone has destroy'd more than our thirty 
Years War, and will do the Business as 
well as the best of them] not forgetting 
the burnt Brandy prepar'd at home; he, I 
say, who takes this Method, at this time, is 
little wiser than one who claps the 
Muzzle of the Pistol into the Patient's Fun- 
dament, and lets fly, in hopes to clear the 
Way of all Obstructions: Pardon the 
Comparison, but I can assure you, the 
one is likely near upon with the other, 
to destroy the Diseased and the Disease to- 
gether. Again, he who shall attempt, 
and give one of the strong Glysters, much 
more the Purges at this time, which are 
customary in the Cold, Phlegmatick, or 
Vitreous Cholick, will act as wildly; the 
same will have the like evil Tendency in 
the Hysterick Cholick, where the chief In- 
tention is by some of the Fœtid or Hysterick
Remedies, so called, mix'd with Opiates, 
to take off the Hurry, and bridle the ex- 
|P_30
orbitant Outrage of the Spirits. Farther, 
He likewise who pursues this Course with 
hot inflaming Spirits, and hot Purges, in 
expectation of easing the Stone-Cholick, 
where soft, glib, slippery, and oyly Me- 
dicines, lenient Glysters, and cooling Pur- 
gatives, with Opiates, especially in the 
Fit, are indicated, will be as much disap- 
pointed. On the contrary, He who di- 
rects cold Water, Milk and Water, Bar- 
ley Water, Almond Milks, and the like, 
in the Cold Phlegmatick Cholick, [howbeit 
well suited to the Bilious and Hot] where 
the hotter Carminative Compositions, 
warm Glysters, and brisk Purges, bridled 
however with some Opiate, are requisite, 
will shoot also as wide of the Mark. 

Hence I think it will appear self-evi- 
dent, that whoever trusts to any of these 
Anticholical Remedies, so denominated and 
sold about the Town, must expect to 
risque his Health, if not his Life, since the 
Chance is so great of its doing more Hurt 
than Good; and if the best Physicians are 
sometimes puzzled, who attend at the 
Bed-side of the Patient, and inform them- 
selves all they can, yet find, by a peculiar 
Symptom, or accidental Appearance af- 
terwards, that they had gone before upon 
a wrong Notion of the Case, which be- 
ing by this new Discovery let into, they 
|P_31
quickly after can relieve the Sick Person; 
if this be so, as frequently falls out, how, 
I say, is it to be expected, that any single 
Medicament, made up by a Quack who 
knows nothing of these Distinctions [or 
if he did, could in this way provide for 
the same] can answer the Expectation. 
You see it must be Hot, and it must be Cold; 
it most Purge strongly, weakly, and it must 
not Purge at all; it must cause Rest, and 
must prevent Sleep; with several other very 
opposite Qualities, which are contradicto- 
ry in the very Terms, and therefore both 
impossible and impracticable in this pub- 
lick way. 

The second Objection I raised against 
these Quack-Remedies sold at the Shops, 
was founded on the differing Constitutions, 
and divers Circumstances otherways at- 
tending upon the same Patient; and I will 
here instance in another popular Disease, 
the Scorvy, which together with that of 
the Worms, father many more Distempers 
than they have a just right to, and by the 
mistaken Conceptions whereof, many a- 
dult Persons have suffer'd by the one, as 
thousands of Children have done by the 
other. I deny not but they are both com- 
mon Diseases, yet I would have no one 
take a Remedy for either, till by the Judg- 
ment of some able Physician, they are 
|P_32
inform'd what Ground they go upon; 
but I hasten to my Business. 

The Scorvy has been usually, by all 
good Modern Writers, divided into a 
Salino Sulphureous, and a Sulphureo Saline; 
but these being Words not at all intelli- 
gible to common Readers, for which this is 
designed chiefly, we shall distinguish it 
only as Acid and Salt, or, if you please, a 
cold and a hot Scorvy; and indeed without 
regard to this simple Division, it is impos- 
sible either to conceive a true Notion of the 
Disease, or to adapt Remedies for the 
Cure: Some have made a middle Species, 
and truly with respect to some Tempe- 
raments, lying betwixt the two Extremes, 
not improperly. 

Now as the Acid or Cold Scorvy will 
dispense with some of the hot and biting 
Plants, such as Horse-radish, Arsmart, 
Scorvy-grass, Wormwood, Aron-Roots, Win- 
ters-Bark, Orange-Peel, and the like; with 
distill'd Waters, Tinctures, Wines, Spirits, 
extracted thence; so contrarily, the Sul- 
phureo Saline, or the Hot Scorvy, requires 
the more cold or temperate; such are En- 
dive, Dandalyon, Plantane, Fumitory, Ci- 
chory, Sorrel, and such like; either in De- 
coctions, Infusions, or the simple Juices cla- 
rified, which exceed all other Forms. The 
middle sort may have them chosen out of 
|P_33
both the foregoing, as may best suit the 
Patient's Temperament or Constitution, 
without regard to which, it will be im- 
possible any one afflicted with this Di- 
stemper, can ever receive the Advantage 
that otherwise he might, and no won- 
der that in over-looking thereof, so ma- 
ny People fall under worse Circumstances 
than before, much heightening the very 
Symptoms, of which they thought them- 
selves pursuing the Cure; and here I 
think I have a fair Opportunity to ac- 
quaint you, that those very common Re- 
medies, with which more especially the 
Town is stock'd by Quacks and Empiricks, 
I mean the Spirits of Scorvy-grass [to thou- 
sands of whom each has prov'd a very scurvy 
Spirit] whether plain or purging, have 
been some of the most pernicious and de- 
structive Remedies that were ever adver- 
tis'd in Publick, especially to the hot, 
saline, squalid, and emaciated Habits, whose 
Blood has been thereby fired to that de- 
gree, and the Disease so aggravated, that 
I have seen hundreds of them broke out 
with Blotches and Boils, who were clear 
before the taking thereof; others have 
become as it were Leprous; others drove 
into Hecticks and Consumptions, and the 
Spots or Eruptions growing ten times 
worse under the expected Remedy. Nor 
|P_34
is it likely it should happen otherwise, 
where no regard is had, as I said before, 
to these three different States, Tempera- 
ments, or Habits of Body, but led away 
with the empty Name of Spirits of Scorvy- 
grass, giving the same promiscuously to all 
of them. 

From these Spirits I might pass to o- 
thers, tho' not of the like Nature, yet of 
the same Form; particularly the two late 
ones set up for Sale by some of the same 
People, I mean the Spirit of Ground-Ivy, 
and the Spirit of Bohea-Tea, as to which 
my time will not allow me to make far- 
ther Remarks, than that they seem all of 
them to contain much more of the Arti- 
ficial Productions of the Element, made 
use of to extract them, than the simple 
or natural Ones of the Plant they are 
drawn from; or, [as an excellent Physi- 
cian has well observ'd of some others] 
that they are rather Creatures of the 
Fire, than real or inherent Qualities ex- 
isting before therein; and that notwith- 
standing they may be well enough suited 
to some few Cases, where the hot and 
spirituous Regimen [as Physicians call it] 
is allowable, yet, generally speaking, they 
are much more hurtful than beneficial; 
and whoever will be at the Pains of infu- 
sing or steeping the well-dry'd Plant in hot 
|P_35
Water, as the common Tea is prepar'd, 
or taking the clarify'd Juice from the 
Green one, when the Season will admit, 
will have a Remedy infinitely preferable 
to these fiery Spirits. 

As to the Teas, peculiarly so termed, a 
foolish Custom has now brought them in- 
to such Request among People of all sorts, 
that to go about the crying them down 
were to little purpose; nor indeed till we 
know what better Amusement to intro- 
duce [for there is, it seems, no Conver- 
sation that can be upheld without some 
tipling of one kind or other] in their 
room, would it be expedient. The pre- 
sent have many powerful Advocates on 
their side, any one of which might en- 
danger the over-setting a single Adver- 
sary; for first of all, if these Liquors 
were disus'd, the Crown would be robb'd 
of a considerable Revenue: the E. I. C. 
put to their Trumps to send abroad so 
much of our Silver, which they barter 
away for these dry Leaves, and some 
other Toys and Trifles, especially the 
Earthen Ware that comes along with them; 
[but sure it is no more than right, that 
those who furnish the Regalio, should send 
us likewise the Utensils with which it is 
dish'd out]; and lastly, to name no more, 
the Grocer would be at as great a loss to 
|P_36
get off his Loaf-Sugar; so that upon all 
these Considerations, we will leave it 
where we found it, with this farther Ad- 
monition to all those who have a value for 
their Gums and Teeth, if nothing else, 
that they would leave off thus perpetu- 
ally Codling or Parboyling of them, un- 
less they intend them, at long run, to be 
served up at the same Table for a second 
Course. In a word, I can't think any of 
these scalding hot Infusions, fit for any 
other than a Physical use; but if they must 
take place, methinks 'tis great pity we 
are oblig'd to send so far for somewhat, 
whose Place [were we minded to make the 
Enquiry] might be as well, if not much 
better, supply'd at Home, it being a cer- 
tain Truth, that no Man walks a Mile 
from the Town's end, but treads upon 
many a more useful Plant than this; but to 
return to our Subject, the Scorvy. 

There is, farthermore, scarce any thing 
so common, as to find this Disease 
complicated with some others, requiring 
variety of Prescriptions and Compositions 
suited to the present Indication, that is, 
such other peculiar Ingredients in the Anti- 
scorbutick Mixture, as may best answer the 
variety of Symptoms, which are so vari- 
ous at sometimes, that the highest Pru- 
dence, and great Judgment, is often 
|P_37
wanted to trace out the Original, and to 
know certainly, whether the same are 
Symptoms only of the Scorvy, or primary 
and original Diseases of themselves: thus 
to instance, In the Head, we have often 
Giddiness and great Pain, like a common 
Head-ach; rotten or putrid Gums in the 
Mouth like the Canker, as the good old 
Women call it; in the Breast, Palpitation of 
the Heart and Swooning: shortness of the 
Breath, as in the Asthma; in the Belly, Cho- 
licks and Bloody Fluxes, as from other 
Causes; with wandering and flying Pains in 
the Limbs like the Rheumatism; together 
with sundry other intricate Symptoms, 
which in adapting our Remedies to the 
Disease in general, are always most heed- 
fully to be respected; and for which there- 
fore, none of these Quack Remedies, how 
carefully soever compounded, can make 
a necessary Provision. 

My third Exception against these Em- 
pirical Medicines publish'd in this way, 
was taken from the Consideration of the 
same Disease circumstantiated differently 
one Day, perhaps one Hour, from what it 
was in that before, or may be in the follow- 
ing, and requiring also a quite differing 
Method in the Cure: And here I shall 
give Example in that most terrible, but 
common Distemper, the Gravel and Stone, 
|P_38
which in the Fit requires one Remedy; out of 
it, another; or if too big to pass [here also 
the learned Physician can only judge] one 
Intention; if passing, a second; and if passed 
into the Bladder, a third: And here, I 
say, the Presence of an experienc'd Phy- 
sician is as much wanted as any where, 
and a Mistake herein has often cost the 
poor tormented Patient his Life; torment- 
ed, I say, by his Disease, and still farther 
tormented by a Quack Remedy he had 
rashly taken; but farther to enlarge up- 
on this Subject by way of Explanation. 
When the Stone then is fix'd in the Kid- 
ney, and too big to pass [known only as 
above by the Scrutiny of an able or expe- 
rienc'd Physician] all we can do here, is 
rationally to blunt the Pain with Anodyne
or Opiate Medicines suited thereunto; 
whilst in the mean time we try to sheath 
the Acrimony of the Humours by proper 
Emulsions, Almond Milks, and other soft 
or Mucilaginous Medicines, as Physicians 
call them, having Regard also to the 
bloody Water that is sometimes made, 
when the Stone shall happen to shift its 
Place, and with its Points or Angles 
wound some of the tender Vessels. 

When the Stone [being passable] is 
moved down into the Ureter [the Passage 
from the Kidney to the Bladder, so named, 
|P_39
about the bigness of a small Goose quill, long, 
and somewhat distorted like the letter s] 
we are then, by some oyly, glib, soft, 
smooth, or slippery Medicines, as before ob- 
served, Turpentine Clisters, also emollient 
Oyls and Baths externally, to attempt the 
dilating of these narrow Pipes, and make 
way for its descent or passing on; in the 
mean time, directing also [as aforesaid] pro- 
per Anodynes to appease the Pain, or blunt 
the exquisite Sensation thereof; and believe 
me, whoever shall give or take at this Jun- 
cture, either Tipping's Liquor, the Volatile 
Cleanser, Rogers's Powder, or any other, e- 
ven Honorato Fornello, Gent. and no Physician, 
his Dissolution Salt, will run great danger 
of encreasing their Torture, plugging up 
the obstructing Stone, and miserably de- 
stroying you; the mildest Diuretic, or 
Urine-forcer, doing, at such times, incre- 
dible Mischief: And altho' some of them 
may be after useful, together with dilu- 
ting Liquors, to cleanse the Passages, and 
wash the Kidneys; yet the Continuance 
of them unseasonably, has sometimes 
both weaken'd the Urinary Parts, and 
brought more of this sabulous or gravelly 
Matter, together with some concreting 
Salts out of the Blood, than might other- 
wise have fallen down; so that upon all 
these Considerations, you must surely be 
|P_40
apprized how dangerous it will be for you 
to rely upon any of these, however cele- 
brated Remedies, sold up and down the 
Town by Quacks, or ignorant Persons; 
not one of which either ever was, or can 
be so contriv'd, as to answer all the pro- 
per Intentions, how specifically soever they 
are compounded: Of which farther pre- 
sently, when we enquire into their Na- 
ture. 

My fourth Reason for disswading you 
against these Medicines, was taken from 
the vastly differing Causes, giving Rise 
to the fame Distemper, and which are al- 
ways carefully to be respected, in our 
Physical Prescriptions for the same. And 
here I shall set before you, one of the 
most common [and which through tam- 
pering first of all with Quack Remedies, 
and old Wives Receipts, at least for want 
of timely Application to the learned Phy- 
sician, makes one of the most considerable 
Numbers in our Bills of Mortality] that 
is a Consumption, of which, besides the 
general distinction of Original and Sympto- 
matical, we have from one of the best 
Writers of this Distemper [and who knew 
as well as any other how to cure it] the 
following particular ones reckon'd up; as 
a Consumption from great Loss of Blood, or 
other Evacuations, as from Ulcers, Fistula's 
|P_41
or Apostems; from giving Suck, a Looseness, 
Diabetes, Sweats, Salivations; likewise, 
Consumptions from a Dropsy, the Kings-Evil, 
Scorvy, Asthma, Melancholy, Stones in the 
Lungs, the French Pox: Again, there 
are Consumptions from the Green-sickness, 
Intermitting Fevers or Agues, Pleurisies, 
Jaundice; from the Gout, Rheumatism, 
with certain others too tedious and unne- 
cessary farther to take notice of. 

Now altho' in each of these we have 
one general Aim, viz. the recruiting the 
decay'd Habit; yet not only the Symp- 
toms, such as the Cough, Looseness, 
Sweats, &c. afford divers Indications, and 
a different Management, but in each of 
them, very singular regard is to be had 
to the original Disease, of which these 
Symptons are only Consequents: Thus 
for Example, if we think to cure a Con- 
sumption from the Evil with the same Re- 
medies we set upon another from a Dropsy; 
or if we undertake to cure another from 
bleeding at the Nose, or other parts of the 
Body, with those we direct for the Cure 
of one from an Asthma, Scorvy, or Jaun- 
dice, we shall find our selves very much 
out of the way of obtaining our desired 
Ends: No wiser is he, who enterprizes 
the Cure of a Pocky Hectic with Antiscor- 
buticks, requir'd in the Cure of a Consump- 
|P_42
tion from the Scorvy; nay, if he mix not 
the Counter-poison, I mean some Mercurial
Preparation, with his Pectoral or Anti- 
phthisical Remedies, at least orders them 
not between whiles, he will find he is do- 
ing somewhat worse than washing the 
Æthiopian White, that is losing his La- 
bour only, but is accessary also to the 
poor Man's Death, which, in all proba- 
bility, had been prevented by the Care of 
a more understanding and expert Physi- 
cian. In a word, he who fancies he can 
cure any one of these Consumptions we 
have already recounted, with the same 
Regimen, that may be truly useful for 
some other of them, is upon the same level 
of Understanding with the Undertaker, 
to fit all Bodies with the same Suit of 
Apparel; since it is manifestly apparent, 
that in each of them, the Method must 
be in some Particulars varied, and conse- 
quently many of them thus differing, 
even radically one from the other, there 
can be no radical Cure [according to the 
vain Pretence of one our present Re- 
ceipt Quacks] by any single Remedy 
whatever, even that very common Symp- 
tom attending almost all of them, espe- 
cially towards the Conclusion, I mean the 
Cough, requires the utmost of our Caution 
and Circumspection, in endeavouring to 
|P_43
ease the Sick herein; for tho' many of 
them bear Opiates well, and that we can 
do little or nothing without them, as in the 
Melancholy particularly, and several others 
with a thin Catarrh, or with a dry Convul- 
sive Tickling, and a tolerable good Breath- 
ing; yet in some others, as the Scorbutic
with a tough Phlegm, difficult Expectoration, 
and short Breath; in the Hydropic, and espe- 
cially the Asthmatick, half a Grain of Lau- 
danum, given by some Quack or Empiric, 
has sent many of these People to their long 
Home; the Authors of whose untimely 
Ends [had Justice taken Place] ought, 
from the Gallows, to have been sent after 
them. 

I come now to my last Objection a- 
gainst these Medicines, which I took from 
the singular and unaccountable Antipathies
of particular Persons, against some parti- 
cular Ingredients in a Composition; 
which, how mean soever it may appear 
to be raised here, has always had great 
Regard in Physic; and the want of Fore- 
sight or Pre-consideration thereof, has 
been exceedingly pernicious to some Pa- 
tients, and has also disgraced the Physician. 
To instance in one or two Examples: Some 
few Hysteric Women there are, who receive a 
very singular Relief by a full Dose of Musk 
or Civet, whereas a Grain of either, to the 
|P_44
greater Number of that Sex, is exceedingly 
displeasing, and to some of them has been al- 
most fatal. Again, There are some of both 
Sexes who can bear Opium well, and sleep 
quietly therewith; whilst others are confound- 
ed, and almost distracted, till the Effects of 
it are worn off. The least quantity of Honey
will purge and swell up some as if they were 
Poison'd: Hence Diascordium, Venice- 
Treacle, and Mithridate, not only upon 
this Account, but sometimes also upon some 
other Secret, or, as we say, natural Anti- 
pathy or Aversion, instead of being Anti- 
dotes, are like Poison it self to some parti- 
cular Constitutions. Mint-Water to one I 
know, is the most certain Vomit, tho' it stops 
that Complaint in almost all others. Saffron, 
a Cordial to the generality, I have also ob- 
served by the like Secret, Antipathy, has cau- 
sed others to faint away, either by the Smell 
or Taste. It were too tedious to reckon 
up more of this kind, which the prudent 
Physician, by converse with his Patient, 
and Enquiries of this Nature, can easily 
obviate and provide against; but of 
which, in this publick way of purchasing 
Quack Remedies [I wish I could say that 
were all] you must run the Hazard. 

I have given only a single Instance un- 
der each Head of these Objections, that 
I might not swell this little Tract beyond 
|P_45
its intended Bounds; and indeed to have 
singled out each Disease, and commented 
thereon, would have been to have writ 
a kind of Physical History for the use of 
Physicians, who know, perhaps, already 
[at least many of them] more than my 
self, instead of some short Hints and In- 
structions, for the use of others, and for 
whom this present Disquisition is only in- 
tended; for there is no Distemper with 
which we are afflicted, but in unfolding 
after the same manner, I could easily 
make it appear, and I hope also, convince 
you, that no Remedy for any of them, 
this way recommended, can be securely 
rely'd on; that it may possibly afford 
some Benefit, but much more probably 
do you a Mischief; or in other Words, 
that in about twenty, there is one Chance 
for, to nineteen, against you. Who then 
that has his Senses would thus act in the 
Dark in an Affair so valuable as their 
Health? Or who thus throw the Dye, as it 
were, upon the Drum-head, for their Life, if 
they could avoid it? 

Can you now believe it possible, in so great 
variety of Symptoms, appearing under the 
same Disease, some of them so contradictory to 
each other in their Indications or Intentions 
of Healing; so great Affinity or Likeness of 
one Disease with another in some common 
|P_46
Symptoms, yet requiring, as you see, a va- 
rious Method, the Mistakes in which have 
been of the highest Consequences; such diver- 
sity of Habits or Constitutions likewise to be 
carefully respected; also the sudden Changes and 
Alterations; the different Appearances on Hour 
of the same Distemper, from what it was the 
Hour before, or may be next, and calling for a 
quite different Prescription; the Sympathies and 
Antipathies natural to some certain Persons 
likewise to be observed: I say, if you can be- 
lieve all these are to be provided for by any 
simple Quack Remedy whatever, left to sell 
at a Tradesman's Shop, you must believe 
at the same time, that a Taylor, Shoe- 
maker, nay, that any Old Woman who 
can neither read nor write, nor yet 
speak intelligibly, knows as much of Me- 
dicine as the best of us all; or that one 
who never look'd into a Humane Body, 
may be as well acquainted with all the 
minutest Parts therein, their Scituation 
and Use, as the greatest Master of Anato- 
my. But I must believe better of the 
Generality of my Readers, most of which, 
I dare think, have been thus imposed on 
for want of having the Truth set in a clear 
Light, and in a Way suited to their Un- 
derstandings.
