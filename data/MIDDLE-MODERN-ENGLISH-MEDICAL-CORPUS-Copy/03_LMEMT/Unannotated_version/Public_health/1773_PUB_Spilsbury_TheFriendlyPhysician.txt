[}DIRECTIONS
FOR FURNISHING 
MEDICINE CHESTS. }]
I HAVE, in the course of this work, exceeded 
the bounds I, at first, intended; and have taken 
notice of several Medicines, which are useful on 
particular occasions, (and which the public may 
be furnished with, if they think proper) though 
not absolutely necessary to be kept in every 
house. The small Chests, with a few bottles, 
will ever be found the most serviceable; the 
use of which I most strongly plead for, without 
interest; as I am intirely against any secret 
nostrums being put in; and hope no one will 
encourage any such practices. 

[}A TABLE OF WEIGHTS. }]
Twenty Grains — make —One Scruple. 
Three Scrupies — One Drachm. 
Eight Drams — One Ounce. 
Twelve Ounces — One Pound. 
A Gill in Measure is called Four Ounces in Weight. 
Glass Mortars are handy and cheap; and, with care, will 
last some time.

|P_8
As Medicine Chests are made of different 
sizes, each person may adopt which they please: 
the first, nine, or twelve, I particularly recom-
mend to every family. Those who keep the 
whole will have a very good Apothecary's shop; 
and a Physician or Apothecary may make a 
good Medicine up quickly, to suit any exigency. 
I have omitted the Bark, and several other valu-
able Medicines, because there is time sufficient 
to procure them, when wanted: and, first, for 
Colds and Coughs, is 

[}ELIXIR PAREGORIC. }]
This excellent Elixir was invented by Le Mort, 
a French Surgeon, and was called the Elixir 
Asthmatic. It is a Medicine of great efficacy 
|P_9
in fresh Colds or Coughs, and may be given to 
children in the Chin-Cough, commonly called 
the Whooping-Cough. Dose, a tea-spoonful, 
(not more) going to bed. Grown people may 
take more, up to a tea-spoonful and a half. 
It is a gentle opiate. 

N. B. Persons who are subject to a bad Cough, of long 
standing, and Shortness of Breath, must take care not to 
meddle with it, an account of the Opium in it, which 
would almost choak them. When a person has got a Cold, 
they should put on a double night-cap, and a woollen stock-
ing round their neck. Children are frequently troubled 
with a Cough that proceeds from eating trash, which occa-
sions tough phlegm to be lodged in the stomach: in that 
case, or where it is a Whooping-Cough, a gentle vomit of 
Ipecacoanha wine, (dose, two drams, in any pleasant liquor, 
for a child of six years old) may be given; or a gentle 
purge; as, Take manna, half an ounce; dissolve it in a cup 
of tea; and add Tincture of Jalap, one tea-spoonful: but, 
where Worms are suspected, a dose of Basilicon Powder 
must be given. 

Observe, in taking of Medicines, to begin with a small 
dose, and so increase or diminish as you find them operate: 
by this you will discover what is commonly called the Con-
stitution. In Fevers this should be given very sparingly, 
as it will rather increase the heat. 

[}BALSAM ANODYNE. }]
This is a valuable composition. It cures fresh 
Aches and Pains, arising from Colds, almost to 
a wonder. Those who are troubled with the 
Gout, or Rheumatism, must use Opodeldoc. 

It likewise cures the Tooth and Head-Ach, 
and is the basis of those Tinctures advertised. 
For Outward Pains, rub half an ounce well in 
before the fire, and wear a flannel. For Ner-
vous Cholics, or Gravelly Complaints, it is some-
times used. Dose, twenty drops to sixty, for a 
grown person. This is a stronger Opiate than 
the former. 

[}BALSAM TRAUMATIC, 
OR, 
BAUME DE COMMANDEUR. }]
This is similar to the Fryar's and Turlington's 
Balsam, and is used for the same purposes, viz. 
Fresh Cuts. It is good for inward Decays, 
and tickling Coughs. As it is so generally 
known, I shall not say any more to recommend 
it. It is rather thinner than the advertised Medi-
cines, but no ways inferior. 

|P_10
[}SOOT DROPS, 
OR, 
TINCTURE OF SOOT. }]
Where children are these Drops should always 
be at hand; there is not any Medicine of so great 
efficacy as this is in bringing people out of Fits, 
when properly applied. I have known a grown 
person seized with Fits, which before used to 
hold an hour, and could not be brought to her-
self by any of those cruel, mis-judged methods 
very often made use of by strangers, as forcing 
open the hands, pinching, burning, &c. which 
is wrong. My method was, to pour a pap-spoon-
ful of these Drops down the Patient's throat by 
itself, and almost immediately they would reco-
ver; if not, I gave the second, which seldom 
failed; indeed, I never knew it to fail. It is a safe 
Medicine for children from one to four years old: 
I lower it for them by mixing two or three parts 
water with it, as one tea-spoonful of Drops and 
three of water; when children either purge or 
vomit, the danger is over: rubbing their limbs 
and soles of the feet is good. The best preserva-
tive against Fits is an Issue, and purge off the 
acids with Magnesia and Rhubarb. In Lethargy 
Fits, a strong vomit must be forced down, as the 
Wine of Antimony, the Sal Vitriol; these two 
last Medicines require judgement. 

|P_11
[}The STYPTIC TINCTURE. }]
As sometimes accidents happen by breaking a 
blood-vessel, or too great an effusion of blood, I 
have thought proper to recommend this to be 
kept ready, and will answer all the end of the 
celebrated Styptic of Helvetius or Eaton. Dip a 
piece of cloth in it, and apply to the part. 

[}SPIRIT OF ROSEMARY, 
OTHERWISE, 
HUNGARY WATER. 
SIMPLE SPIRIT OF LAVENDER. }]
Both of these, when made in perfection, are 
very grateful and fragrant: they are frequently 
rubbed on the temples, &c. under the notion of 
refreshing and comforting the nerves; and like-
wise taken internally, to the quantity of two or 
three tea-spoonfuls, as warm cordials, in wine, &c. 

[}WINE OF IPECACOHANA, 
COMMONLY CALLED, 
The SACK VOMIT. }]
It is mild, safe, and serviceable in Dysenteries: 
The Powder of Ipecacohana is best for small 
Chests. Dose of the Wine for a child six years 
old is six drams, in Powder four grains; grown 
|P_12
people one ounce and a half of the Wine, and in 
Powder ten grains. 

[}HARTSHORN DROPS. }]
Their use is well known. Dose from ten 
Drops to sixty. 

[}SALTS OF HARTSHORN. }]
The dose is from a grain or two to ten or 
twelve. 

[}TINCTURE OF MARTIAL FLOWERS, 
OR OF IRON. }]
People who live at a distance from chalybeat 
waters may supply themselves by substituting this 
Tincture, by dropping from ten to twenty drops 
in any vehicle twice or thrice a day. 

[}SWEET SPIRIT OF NITRE. }]
A pleasant, cooling, diuretic Medicine. Dose 
from ten to fifty drops. Good in Fevers. 

|P_13
[}The SWEET SPIRIT OF VITRIOL, 
ACID ELIXIR OF VITRIOL, 
AND
SWEET ELIXIR OF VITRIOL, }]
Are often used, on particular occasions, for 
weakness and relaxations of the Stomach, and 
decays of Constitution. 

[}The VOLATILE TINCTURE OF 
VALERIAN. }]
Is a very good hysteric Medicine in nervous 
cases and lowness of spirits. Dose, three times 
a day, from one to two tea-spoonfuls in a glass 
of any liquor, as wine, or wine and water. 

[}TINCTURE OF JALAP. }]
Is a useful, safe purgative; if it had not that 
burning heat in the throat, it would not be un-
pleasant: It is handy to mix in small quantities in 
any effusion, especially for children, whose aver-
sion to Physic creates much trouble. Dose for 
children six years old a small tea-spoonful; grown 
people two spoonfuls, in any liquor. Jalap is 
frequently used in Scurvy-grass, and concen-
trated juices sold as Quack Medicines, and when 
dropped in water or beer turns whitish. 

|P_14
[}STOMACHIC ELIXIR, 
OTHERWISE, 
STOUGHTON's ELIXIR. }]
Take of Gentian root two ounces, 
Orange peel one ounce, 
Virginian snake-root half an ounce, 
Cochineal half a dram, 
French brandy two pints. 

Let them steep for three days, then filter the 
Elixir.—This safe Medicine, being so generally 
known, needs no further comment. Dose from 
one to four tea-spoonfuls, in any liquor. 

[}TINCTURE OF SENA, 
OR, 
DAFFY's ELIXIR. }]
This mixture is warm and comfortable to the 
stomach and bowels, and somewhat proper in 
cholic complaints, and for the wind. Dose for 
grown persons one ounce or two; if given to 
children, lower the dose, as it is too hot for their 
tender mouths. 

[}SPIRITS OF WINE AND CAMPHOR }]
Is very handy for sprains, inflammations, dis-
cussing tumours, preventing gangreens, &c. 

|P_15
[}LIQUID LAUDANUM, 
OR,
THEBAIC TINCTURE, 
AnOpiate. }]
A good Medicine in skilful hands, but very 
dangerous in ignorant. The white Syrup of 
Poppies is a very good opiate, and not so dan-
gerous. Peppermint-water, sweetened with this 
Syrup, is good to stop vomiting, or an over 
purging. One grain of Laudanum in substance 
is equal to thirty drops of the liquid for strength. 

[}BITTER TINCTURE. }]
Is handy for those who like to drink it in wine, 
or make purl of it; is very safe, and helps di-
gestion. Dose thirty to sixty drops. 

[}The AROMATIC TINCTURE }]
Is a very warm Medicine for weakness of the 
stomach, in languors and flatulencies, and other 
like complaints. Dose a tea-spoonful or two in a 
glass of wine, or wine and water. 

[}HUXHAM's WINE OF ANTIMONY }]
I prefer to that directed by the College of 
Physicians: it is a noble Medicine. In proper 
hands good to be given against the Small-pox, as 
|P_16
a preparative for Inoculation, for coughs as an 
alterative and diaphoretic, and apoplectic cases. 
None ought to meddle with it but with great care. 
Dose for a child eight years old one tea-spoonful 
in a glass of water, grown people two; three is 
a large dose, it vomits very strong. Rectified 
Spirits of Wine, poured on the glass of Antimony, 
will neither vomit nor purge, and is the basis of 
Norris's and Rysseeg's Medicines. 

[}SPIRIT OF LAVENDER COMPOUND. }]
This is the red drops of Lavender, very good 
to snuff up the nose when you have got cold: it 
comforts the head, and raises the spirits. Dose 
from twenty to sixty drops, on sugar or in wine 
and water. 

[}An IMITATION OF BAUME DE VIE. }]
Take of the Sacred Tincture two ounces, of 
the Stomach Tincture one ounce, Syrup of Saf-
fron two drams, mixed. This is a very pleasant, 
safe, easy purge, and no ways inferior to that 
boasted Medicine "Baume de Vie" in it's vir-
tues. Try and believe. 

Observe, People that are troubled with the 
Piles must not meddle with aloetic Medicines, 
as this and the Baume de Vie, likewise Scotch 
Pills. 

|P_17
[}JESUITS DROPS, 
OR, 
BALSAMIC TINCTURE. }]
Take Balsam of Capivi one ounce, Gum 
Guiacum two drams, Balsam of Peru four drams, 
Oil of Sassafras two scruples, Salt of Tartar 
twelve grains, rectified Spirits of Wine nine 
ounces: digest them together for four days, and 
pour off what is fine for use. This is partly taken 
from Le Mort, who gave the Proprietor the first 
hint. It is an admirable warm Medicine, and a 
pity it is not more known in some cases: it has 
long been advertised for curing a certain disorder, 
which it will not cure. This Medicine is ex-
ceeding good for ulcerations, decays of the lungs 
and kidneys, fresh cuts, &c. and for that painful 
complaint the stone in the gall, or the gravel. 
Dose one tea-spoonful to three or four, when re-
quired. It turns water like milk, as Balsams 
will do when lowered. With this I have often 
cured a pain in the bowels or stomach much 
sooner than the Tincture of Rhubarb so often pre-
scribed. 

[}COMPOUND POWDER OF CONTRA-
YERVA. }]
This is a Powder much superior to the Gas-
coigne's; it is a warm, sudorific, cordial Medi-
cine, and given in low fevers, or where a sweat 
|P_18
is wanted to be raised. Dose ten grains to half a 
dram, every fourth and sixth hour. 

[}MAGNESIA. }]
An exceeding good, safe, useful Medicine; no 
family should be without it: given with Rhubarb 
to correct and purge off the acids in the sto-
mach.[/2./]

[}RHUBARB. }]
[}ThePowder}]
Is well known: it is good for strengthening 
the stomach, and purging off crudities. Dose for 
one seven years old twelve grains, a grown per-
son half a dram. 

[}NITRE. }]
[}White Powder. }]
A cooling diuretic. Dose from ten grains to 
twenty-four, twice a day. It should be taken in 
warm water, with a little spirit and sugar, to 
sweeten and correct the coldness. It will allay 
heat. 

|P_19
[}CREAM OF TARTAR. 
A White Powder. }]
This is an agreeable acid, and sometimes, in 
making of punch, supplies the place of lemon-
juice: it purges very gently. Dose from ten 
grains to two drams. A safe Medicine. 

[}SPERMA CETI. }]
Is useful in lying-in cases and miscarriages, or 
inward bruises or coughs. 

[}The ROYAL BASILICAN POWDER, 
FromQuincey. }]
Quincey says, and not without reason, this is 
one of the best purges for gross children, that are 
apt to breed worms, and have large bellies. The 
ingredients are efficacious; it's operation is mild, 
and wonderfully clears the bowels of slime. 
This Cathartic is very proper to be given to per-
sons when they are to be inoculated. It is a very 
good Family Medicine, and will be of service in 
the Gout, Rheumatism, Itch, Leprosy, Evil, and 
other cutaneous disorders. Take care not to 
catch cold. Dose for children from six grains to 
fifteen, for grown people from fifteen to forty, 
mixed with a syrup; for it is a heavy powder, 
and a mercurial preparation. 

|P_20
[}WHITE EMULSION, 
for aCough, orPainin theSide. }]
Take Oil of sweet Almonds, and Syrup of 
Balsam, of each two ounces; four ounces of bar-
ley-water, and thirty drops of Sal Volatile: shake 
them well together, and take two large spoon-
fuls. If this does not answer, it will be necessary 
to be blooded. 

[}For the AGUE.}]
Best Bark two drams, Salt of Wormwood half 
a dram, and Snake-root half a dram: divide it 
into four doses; one dose in a morning fasting, 
two hours before the fit comes on. 

[}For the GOUT.}]
A safe, simple remedy, which will give ease, 
and keep the Gout off:—Take Flower of Brim-
stone one tea-spoonful, in milk, fasting, every 
morning: it must be continued every day 
throughout the year, and begin after a fit is over; 
it will gripe at first before you are used to it. If 
you doubt, try. 

[}For the JAUNDICE.}]
Take a pint and a half of Ale, and heat a 
poker red hot, and quench it in the Beer, stirring 
it till the hissing is off: let this be repeated four 
|P_21
or five times; then run the Ale through a cloth, 
and put in the Ale that is left two table-spoonfuls 
of Treacle, Saffron, ten grains, and Tamarindcrossed with a line, replaced by #ur, 
in powder, a scruple: stir it, and take the whole 
nine mornings fasting. This has been seldom 
known to fail, and has been kept a secret. 

[}A TINCTURE for the TEETH.}]
Take proof Spirits of Wine eight ounces, Spirit 
of Vitriol sufficient to give it an agreeable acid, 
and Cochineal a scruple: let it stand six hours, 
then filter it thro' a glass funnel. This is what is 
sold at a shilling a bottle at the shops. If I mis-
take not, a Boy's Patent was granted for it — 
Who can help smiling? 

[}For the EAR-ACH. }]
The Smoak of Tobacco blown into the ear is 
excellent; or the Oil of Almonds dropped in the 
ear, mixed with a little Spirit of Lavender Com-
pound. 

[}For the Cure of a Crumb of Bread, or any 
other Ingredient, going down the Throat wrong-
way, as is commonly expressed. }]
Take a bit of fresh Butter the size of a small 
nut, and swallow it gently; if that don't cure, 
add the second bit: it gives ease, and stops the 
fit of coughing. Sweet Oil will do as well as 
Butter. 

|P_22
[}The HEAD-ACH.
A Temporary Relief. }]
Take Spirit of Vitriol, pour a little into the 
palm of the hand, and rub it on the forehead, 
keeping the hand there some time; or the thin 
peel of a Seville Orange fresh cut, without the 
white, put on the forehead, is the best remedy: 
it makes the place smart, and draws the pain out. 

[}A GARGLE for a SORE THROAT. }]
Take the best Vinegar half a pint, Red Port 
Wine a gill, Allum two drams; dissolve it in the 
Vinegar and Wine, then add honey half an 
ounce: mix, and gargle the throat often. A 
Blister round the throat is the best remedy to 
draw the humour off; or rub the Volatile Lini-
ment on the part, and keep the body gently 
open. 

[}The following is a Carminative for Chil-
dren when in pain, and purge too much. }]
Take Mint-water a gill; Rhubarb; sixteen 
grains, Diascordium two scruples; sweeten it 
with sugar: dose a small pap-spoonful for a child 
six months old, going to bed. It comforts the 
bowels, eases the griping pain, and makes them 
sleep. Some simmer the Mint-water and Rhu-
barb together. 

|P_23
[}HUXHAM's TINCTURE OF BARK. }]
Take Peruvian Bark in powder two ounces, 
Seville Orange-peel one ounce and a half, Vir-
ginia Snake-root three drams, Saffron four scru-
ples, French Brandy twenty ounces: and let it 
stand four days. Dose, dram to half an ounce. 
This is given with success in slow nervous fevers, 
and in the decline of putrid, spotted, and pesti-
lential Fevers, though the remissions are very 
obscure: it strengthens the solids, prevents the 
farther dissolution and corruption of the blood, 
and in the event restores its crasis. 

[}BARLEY WATER. }]
Take Barley one ounce, Water two pints, 
often washing the Barley; boil it two minutes, 
throw the Water away, then add fresh Water 
three pints, boil it to a quart. 

[}TINCTURE OF JAPAN. }]
It is astringent, corroborates a relaxed stomach 
and bowels, stops defluxions, catarrhs, vomiting 
diarrheaas, uterine fluxes. Dose half a spoonful 
to a spoonful, in Red Wine or Mint Water. 
The Tincture of Cinnamon, or one made of 
Cassia, will do as well to keep. 

|P_24
[}SCORBUTIC JUICES. }]
Take the juice of Seville Oranges, and of 
Garden Scurvy-grass, each a quart; the juice of 
Brook-lime, and of Water-cresses, of each a pint; 
mix them, and when the dregs are subsided 
strain them through a flannel: these juices, given 
from two to four ounces, two or three times a 
day, and continued for some time, are of consi-
derable use in scorbutic disorders. Similar to this, 
with the addition of Dandelyon and Honey, is 
the Vegetable Syrup which has been so often ad-
vertised. If Mankind lived on a vegetable diet, 
then would this be sufficient to extirpate the dis-
orders; but as we live so high in our sauces and 
made-up dishes, the mineral kingdom, which is 
more ponderous, must be called in. 

[}SPIRIT OF MINDERUS. }]
This is an excellent deobstruent, diuretic, and 
diaphoretic, neutral spirit; and as it operates 
without heat, it may be given in febrille and in-
flammatory disorders, where Medicines of the 
warm kind, if they fail of procuring sweat, ag-
gravate the distemper. This dose is from one 
dram to half an ounce, more or less, according 
to its strength, which is somewhat precarious, 
either by itself, or rather with other Medicines 
adapted to the intention. 

|P_25
[}STOMACH PILLS. }]
Take of Rhubarb one ounce, Socotrine Aloes 
six drams, Myrrh half an ounce, Vitriolated 
Tartar one dram, Essential Oil of Mint half a 
dram, Syrup of Orange-peel a sufficient quanti-
ty: make them into a mass. This Pill is intend-
ed for moderately warming and strengthening 
the stomach, and evacuating crude, viscid hu-
mours. A scruple of the mass may be taken 
twice a day. Some use a Stomach-plaister for 
bad complaints. 

[}The DECOCTION OF BARK. }]
Take Jesuits Bark in Powder one ounce, and 
boil it in a quart of pure water to a pint; towards 
the end add Liquorice-root cut half an ounce, to 
the colature add Nutmeg-water two ounces, and 
mix them. The dose is a small wine-glass, with 
ten, twenty, or forty drops of the Volatile Tinc-
ture of Guiacum. A small quantity of Winter's 
Bark gives it a grateful warmth, and renders a 
quantity of the compound water less necessary. 
This Receipt will make the simple Decoction, 
only leave out the Nutmeg-water. 

[}TOOTH POWDER. }]
Take Dragon's Blood, Allum, Myrrh, Cream 
of Tartar, equal parts, in fine powder, which mix; 
to give it a fine colour some add Vermillion, but 
|P_26
it is better to be let alone. This Powder may be 
used by itself; but if the gums are wasted, you 
may make a Paste, by mixing it with Honey of 
Roses, and use it gently with your finger. 

[}A very good SUDORIFIC TINCTURE.}]
Take Virginia Snake-root six drams, Cochineal 
and English Saffron each two drams, Opium 
one scruple, Spirit of Minderus one pint: digest 
them together in a gentle heat for three days, 
and then pass the Tincture through a strainer. 
This Composition is an efficacious Sudorific, to 
be taken for a Sweat. Dose half an ounce in a 
glass of simple water or wine; taken for easing 
pain, and composing the Patient to sleep. 

[}SALT OF WORMWOOD DRAUGHT. }]
Take a scruple of Salt of Wormwood, pour 
upon it by little and little fresh Lemon-juice, till 
it has quite done fomenting, and tastes quite insi-
pid; about one large spoonful is sufficient; then 
add a little fine Sugar, to make it palatable. 
About a wine-glass of Spring or Barley Water, 
and a pap-spoonful of Cinnamon Water, make a 
most pleasant draught. Above the age of four-
teen it may be given once in six or eight hours, 
in any little feverish complaints, sickness at sto-
mach, watchings, parched dryness of the mouth, 
and such-like ills, and is often preferable to the 
Fever Powder; from seven to fourteen years 
|P_27
half a draught is sufficient; under that age still 
decrease the quantity. 

[}DISTILLED OR ESSENTIAL OILS }]
Are never given alone, on account of their 
extreme heat and pungency, which, in some, is 
so great, that a single drop, let fall upon the 
tongue, produces a gangrenous eschar. They 
are readily imbibed by pure dry sugar, and in 
this form may be conveniently exhibited. Ground 
with eight or ten times their weight of sugar, 
they become soluble in aqueous liquors, and thus 
may be diluted to any assigned degree. Muci-
lages also render them miscible with water in an 
uniform milky liquor. They dissolve likewise in 
spirits of wine, the more fragrant in an equal 
weight, and almost all of them in less than four 
times their own quantity. Their solutions may 
either be taken on sugar, or mixed with syrup, 
or the like: on mixing them with water, the 
liquor grows milky, and the oil separates. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF ANNISEEDS. }]
This Oil possesses the taste and smell of the 
Anniseeds in perfection. It is one of the mildest 
of the distilled Oils: fifteen on twenty drops may 
be taken at a time without dagger, though com-
mon practice rarely goes so far as half the num-
ber. Its smell is extremely durable and diffusive. 
Milk drawn from the breast after taken, it is 
|P_28
found impregnated with it's odour; and possibly 
this may be, in part, the foundation of pectoral 
virtues usually ascribed to it. In Flatulences and 
Cholics it is said by some to be less effectual than 
the seeds themselves. 

[}OIL OF CINNAMON. }]
This valuable Oil is extremely hot and pun-
gent, of a most agreeable flavour, like that of 
Cinnamon itself. In cold languid cases, and de-
bilities of the nervous system, it is one of the 
most immediate cordials and restoratives. The 
dose is one, two, or three drops, which must al-
ways be carefully diluted by the mediation of 
sugar, &c. for so great is the pungency of this 
Oil, that a single drop, let fall upon the tongue 
undiluted, produces (as Boerhaave observes) a 
gangrenous eschar. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF JUNIPER-BERRIES. }]
This Oil is a very warm and pungent one, of 
a strong flavour, not unlike that of berries. In 
the dose of a drop or two it proves a serviceable 
carminative and stomachic, in one of six or eight, 
or more, as stimulating, detergent, diuretic, and 
emmenagogine: it seems to have somewhat of the 
nature of the Turpentines, or their distilled Oils, 
like which it communicates a violent smell to the 
urine. 

|P_29
[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF THE LEAVES OF 
COMMON MINT. }]
This Oil smells and tastes strongly of the 
Mint; but it is, in both respects, somewhat less 
agreeable than the herb itself. It is a useful sto-
machic Medicine, and not unfrequently exhibited 
in want of appetite, weakness of the stomach, 
reachings to vomit, and other like disorders, 
when not accompanied with heat or inflamma-
tion. Two or three drops, or more, are given 
for a dose. It is likewise employed externally 
for the same purposes, and is an excellent ingre-
dient in the stomachic plaister of the shops. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF THE LEAVES OF 
PEPPERMINT. }]
This possesses the smell, taste, and virtues of 
the Peppermint in perfection. The colour is a 
pale greenish yellow. It is a Medicine of great 
pungency and subtility, and diffuses, almost as 
soon as taken, a glowing warmth through the 
whole system. In Cholics, accompanied with 
great coldness, and some hysteric complaints, it 
is of excellent service. A drop or two are in ge-
neral a sufficient dose. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF NUTMEGS. }]
The essential Oil of Nutmegs possesses the fla-
vour and aromatic virtues of the Spice in an 
|P_30
eminent degree. It is similar in quality to the 
Oil of Mace, but somewhat less grateful. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF JAMAICA PEPPER. }]
This is a very elegant Oil, and may be used 
as a succedaneum to those of some of the dearest 
spices. It is of a fine pale colour, in flavour 
more agreeable than the Oil of Cloves, and not 
far short of that of Nutmegs. It sinks in water, 
like the Oils of some of the Eastern Spices. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF THE LEAVES OF 
PENNY ROYAL. }]
This Oil in smell and taste resembles the origi-
nal Plant, the virtues of which it likewise pos-
sesses. It is given in hysteric cases from one to 
four or five drops. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF ROSEMARY. }]
The Oil of Rosemary is drawn from the Plant 
in flower. When in perfection, it is very light 
and thin, pale and almost colourless, of great 
fragrancy, though not quite so agreeable as the 
Rosemary itself. It is recommended in the dose 
of a few drops in nervous and hysteric com-
plaints. Boerhaave holds it in great esteem 
against epilepsies and suppressions of the uterine 
purgations, occasioned by weakness and inacti-
vity. 

|P_31
[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF RHODIUM. }]
This Oil is extremely odoriferous, and princi-
pally employed as a perfume in scenting poma-
tums and the like. Custom has not as yet re-
ceived any preparation of this elegant aromatic 
Wood into internal use. It is a very dear Oil. 

[}ESSENTIAL OIL OF SASSAFRAS. }]
This is the most ponderous of all the known 
essential Oils, but rises in distillation with suffi-
cient ease; it appears limpid as water, has a 
moderately pungent taste, a very fragrant smell, 
exactly resembling that of the Sassafras. It stands greatly recommended as a sudorific, and for pu-
rifying the blood and juices: it is likewise sup-
posed to be of service in humoural Asthmas and 
Coughs. The Dose is from one drop to eight or ten. 

[}OIL OF LAVENDER FLOWERS }]
Is of considerable service, both externally and 
internally, in paralytic complaints, and in debi-
lities of the whole nervous system in general. 
The dose is from two to five or six drops. 

[}SYRUPS. }]
Syrups are saturated solutions of sugar made 
in water, or watery, or vinous infusions, or in 
|P_32
juices. They were formerly considered as Me-
dicines of much greater importance than they are 
thought to be at present. Syrups and distilled 
waters were for some ages made use of as the 
great alteratives, insomuch that the evacuation 
of any peccant humour was never attempted till, 
by a due course of these, it had first been regu-
larly prepared for expulsion: hence arose the ex-
uberant collection of both which we meet with 
in Pharmacopœias, and like errors have pre-
vailed in each. As multitudes of distilled waters 
have been compounded from materials unfit to 
give any virtue over the helm, so numbers of 
Syrups have been prepared of ingredients which, 
in this form, cannot be taken in sufficient doses 
to exert their virtues; for two-thirds of a Syrup 
consist of sugar, and greatest part of the remain-
ing third is an aqueous fluid. Syrups are at pre-
sent chiefly regarded as convenient vehicles for 
Medicines of greater efficacy, and made use of 
for sweetening Draughts and Juleps; for reducing 
the lighter Powders into Boluses, Pills, or Elec-
tuaries; and other like purposes. Some like-
wise may not improperly be considered as Me-
dicines themselves, as those of Saffron or Buck-
thorn-berries. 

[}SYRUP OF MECONIUM 
OR
WHITE POPPIES. }]
This Syrup, impregnated with the opiate mat-
ter of the Poppy-heads, is given to children in 
|P_33
doses of two or three drams, to adults from half 
an ounce to an ounce, and upwards, for obtund-
ing and incrassating acrimonious humours, easing 
pain, procuring rest, and answering the other 
intention of mild opiates. 

[}SYRUP OF SAFFRON. }]
Saffron is very well fitted for making a Syrup, 
as in this form a sufficient dose of it is contained 
in a reasonable compass. This Syrup is at pre-
sent more frequently prescribed, than the Wine 
from which it is made; it is a pleasant cordial, 
and gives a fine colour to Juleps. 

[}The SIMPLE SYRUP. }]
Take of white Sugar and water each equal 
quantities, boil them into a Syrup. These prepa-
rations are plain, liquid, sweets, void of flavour or 
colour; they are convenient for sundry purposes, 
where these qualities are not wanted, or would 
be exceptionable. 

[}OINTMENTS. }]
I recommend the following, which will serve 
in any common accident. 

[}DIACHLON PLAISTER. }]
This plaister is the common application in 
excoriations of the skin, slight fresh wounds, and 
|P_34
the like; it keeps the part soft, and somewhat 
warm, and defends it from the air, which is all 
that can be expected in these cases from any 
plaister. 

[}YELLOW BASILICON. }]
This is commonly employed in dressings for 
digesting, cleansing, and incarnating wounds and 
ulcers. 

[}POMATUM. }]
The use is well known. 

[}BLISTERING PLAISTER }]
Is handy to be kept for the Apothecary to 
apply 

[}LADIES PLAISTER, AND SWEET OIL OF 
OLIVES. }]
Their virtues are well known. 

[}TURNER's CERATE, }]
Is commonly used for cuts, scalds, bruises, 
chilblains, and other trifling complaints, where 
the skin is worn off. 

|P_35
[}OINTMENT FOR THE ITCH. }]
Take of Sulphur one ounce, White Helebore 
Root in powder, or Crude Sal Ammoniac two 
drams, Hog's Lard two ounces, mix arid make 
them into an ointment. Sulphur is a certain 
remedy for the itch, more safe and efficacious 
than Mercury; for, as Dr. Pringle observes, un-
less a Mercurial Unction was to touch every part 
of the skin, there can be no certainty of success. 
The quantity of ointment above directed; serves 
for four Unctions; the patient is to be rubbed 
every night; but, to prevent any disorder that 
might arise from stopping too many pores at 
once, a fourth part only of the body is to be 
rubbed at one time. Though the itch may thus 
be cured by one pot of ointment, it will be proper 
to renew the application, and to touch the parts 
most affected for a few nights longer, till a se-
cond quantity is exhausted. 

[}CLYSTERS. }]
[}ARABIC CLYSTER. }]
Take an ounce of Arabic Mucilage, and six 
ounces of Barley-water, or Mutton-broth, and 
mix for a clyster. 

|P_36
[}DOMESTIC CLYSTER. }]
Take half a pint of thin Gruel, an ounce 
and half of Oil Olive, and a spoonful of brown 
Sugar, mix them together; sometimes a tea-
spoonful of common Salt may be added. 

[}GARGARISMS. }]
[}ASTRINGENT GARGARISM. }]
Take of Tincture of Roses fifteen ounces, 
Alum two drams, Honey of Roses one ounce, 
mix them together. 

[}GARGLE FOR A SORE THROAT. }]
Red Wine and Vinegar, each equal parts, 
sweetened with Honey. 

[}COOLING GARGARISM. }]
Take half a pint of Rose Water, the whites of 
two new laid Eggs, beat up to water, two drams 
of white Sugar-candy, and half a dram of Nitre, 
make a Gargarism. 

[}ASTRINGENT GARGARISM. }]
Take of Tincture of Roses fifteen ounces, 
Alum two drams, Honey of Roses one ounce, 
mix them together. 

|P_37
[}GLAUBER's CATHARITIC SALT. }]
This Salt, commonly called Sal Mirabile, 
taken from three drams to an ounce, or more, 
proves a very mild and useful purgative. 

[}ROCHEL SALT. }]
This elegant purging Salt, taken from the last 
edition of the Paris Pharmacopœia, 1748, under 
the title of Sal Polycrestum Solubile Vulgó de 
Seignette, has, for a long time, been much valued 
in France, and now very deservedly begins to be 
greatly esteemed in this country. It is infinitely 
pleasanter than either Glauber's, or Epsom Salts, 
so called, and operates very gentle without 
griping. Its dose is from half an ounce to one 
ounce, ten drams or more, dissolved in warm 
water, thin gruel, or oatmeal tea. 

[}LEMON DECOCTION. }]
Take of the yellow rind of fresh Lemon-
peel six drams, boiling water one pint, or twelve 
ounces; let them infuse together for a quarter 
of an hour, and after the shortest boiling, only 
three or four bubbles, strain the liquor, and add 
four ounces of Rose Water, two ounces of Lemon 
Juice, and two ounces of double refined Sugar. 
This elegant, grateful, and cooling liquor, is a 
most desirable drink in febrile, bilous or inflam-
matory distempers; for it abates the heat of the 
|P_38
blood and stomach, quenches thirst, and gently 
promotes the salutary excretions. It may be 
drank at pleasure without any limitation. 

[}Dr. BUTLER's ALE. }]
Take of Boteny, Sage, Agrimony, Garden 
Scurvy Grass, Roman Wormwood, each three 
hands full; Elecampane Roots, Horse Radish 
Roots, each four ounces, new Ale four gallons. 
The Herbs and Roots are to be put in a bag, and 
hung in the Ale while it works. This liquor has 
so far obtained among the common people, as 
to have been frequently made and sold in public-
houses. It is used in the Spring for purifying the 
blood, and preventing scorbutic disorders. 

[}JULEPS. }]
[}CAMPHOR JULEP WITH VINEGAR. }]
Take of Camphor one dram, Gum Arabic two 
drams, double refined Sugar half an ounce, Vi-
negar one pint; grind the Camphor with a few 
drops of Spirit of Wine, till it grows soft, then 
add the Gum, previously reduced to a mucilage, 
with equal its quantity of water, and rub them 
together till perfectly mixed; to this mixture 
add by degrees the Vinegar, with Sugar dis-
solved in it. 

|P_39
[}CHALK JULEP. }]
Take of the White Chalk prepared, one 
ounce, double refined Sugar six drams, Gum 
Arabic two drams, Water two pints, mix them 
together. This Julep is designed for heartburns, 
and other like disorders, arising from acid juices 
in the first passages; the chief use of the gum is, 
to give a greater degree of consistence to the 
water, and enable it to keep the, powdered 
Chalk suspended. 

[}STOMACHIC JULEP. }]
Take of Simple Mint-water six ounces, Spiri-
tuous Mint-water two ounces, Syrup of Saffron 
two drams. Or, 

Take of Cinnamon Water six ounces, Nut-
meg-water, and Stomachic Tincture, each one 
ounce, Syrup of Orange-peel half an ounce. 

The titles of these mixtures express the inten-
tions for which they are calculated; four or five 
spoons full maybe taken of either occasionally, 
or used as weakeners and diluters of medicines 
of greater efficacy. 

[}CORDIAL JULEP. }]
Take of Alexterical-water four ounces, Aro-
matic-water two ounces, Volatile Oily Spirit, 
and Tincture of Saffron, each two drams, White 
Sugar half an ounce, mix and make them into a 
|P_40
Julep. This mixture is a useful cordial in all 
depressions of the spirits, in the sinkings of low 
fevers, and the languors to which hysterical and 
hypocondriacal persons are subject; an ounce, 
or two spoons full, may be taken for a dose two 
or three times a day. 

[}DIAPHORETIC JULEP. }]
Take Alexterical-water four ounces, Spirit of 
Minderous two ounces, Salt of Hartshorn ten 
grains, White Sugar six drams, mix them for a 
Julep. This excellent composition is a very 
powerful sudorific, and answers its intentions 
more effectually, and with greater certainty, 
than many others calculated for the same pur-
pose. Where a copious sweat is to be excited, 
as in rheumatic diseases, two spoons full are to be 
taken warm in bed every hour, or two hours, 
till the sweat breaks out; if warm diluting liquors 
are not sufficient to keep it up, the same is to be 
occasionally repeated. 

[}FOETID JULEP. }]
Take of Asafœtida one dram and a half, Rue-
water six ounces, Compound Valerian-water two 
ounces, Oil of Hartshorn twenty drops, White 
Sugar ten drams; rub the Asafœtida in the Rue-
water till it dissolves, and having dropt the Oil 
upon the Sugar, mix the whole together. This 
composition is not a little fœtid and unsightly; it 
|P_41
is nevertheless a medicine of great efficiency in 
hypochondriacal and hysteric disorders, asthmas, 
and other nervous complaints; the dose is one 
spoonful to be taken thrice a day. It is some-
times prepared without the Oil of Hartshorn. 

[}A HYDRAGOGUE JULEP 
For the DROPSY. }]
Take of Camomoile Flower Water six grains, 
Emetic Tartar ten grains, Syrup of Buckthorn 
two ounces mix them together. Two spoons 
full of this Julep are given in hydropic cases 
every two hours, till it takes sufficient effect, as 
a purgative, which it generally does before 
the quantity here prescribed has been made use 
of. Emetic Tartar thus exhibited, in small 
doses, and frequently repeated, proves as certain 
and powerful a cathartic, as it does an emetic, 
when given in a larger quantity at once. It 
operates nevertheless for the most part with suf-
ficient ease. 

[}BINDING JULEP. }]
Take of Alexterical-water four ounces, Aro-
matic-water two ounces, Japonic Confection two 
drams, Japan Earth, in powder, two drams, Li-
quid Laudanum forty drops, White Sugar half an 
ounce, mix them well together. This Julep is 
calculated against disentries and diarrhœas, in 
which, after proper evacuations, it generally 
eases the gripes, and restrains the flux. It is to be 
|P_42
given three or four times a day, in the quantity 
of a spoonful at a time. 

[}CORDIAL MIXTURE. }]
Take of Simple Cinnamon-water four ounces, 
Spirituous Cinnamon-water two ounces, Extract 
of Saffron one scruple, Confection of Kermes six 
drams, mix them together. In great languors 
and depressions a spoonful of this rich Cordial 
Mixture may be taken every half hour. 

[}VALERIAN MIXTURE. }]
Take Simple Pepper Mint-water twelve 
ounces, Wild Valerian Root in powder, one 
ounce, Compound Spirit of Lavender half an 
ounce, Syrup of Orange-peel one ounce, mix 
them together. Wild Valerian Root, one of the 
principle medicines in epilepfies and vertigoes, 
seems to answer better when thus exhibited in 
substance, than if given in form of a tincture or 
infusion; the liquors here joined to it, excellent-
ly coincide with, and by their warmth and pun-
gency, greatly improve its virtues. Two spoons 
full of the Mixture may be taken twice or thrice 
a day. 

[}SALINE CATHARTIC DRAUGHT. }]
Take of Glauber's Cathartic Salts and Manna, 
each six drams, Boiling Water three ounces, 
Tincture of Cardamom one dram. Dissolve the 
|P_43
Salt and Manna in the water, and having strained 
off the liquor, add to it the Tincture of 
Cardamoms. 

[}DIAPHORETIC DRAUGHT. }]
Take of Spirit of Minderus, Syrup of Meco-
nium, each half an ounce, Salt of Hartshorn five 
grains, mix them together. This Draught is a 
very powerful Saline Diaphoretic; it is given 
with safety, and often with great benefit, in the 
beginning of inflammatory fevers after bleeding, 
where theriaca and other warm substances usually 
employed, if they fail in bringing out a sweat, 
increase the fever. 

[}For a CRACK'D LIP, which is apt to bleed on 
any slight pressure. }]
Take a bit of Sticking Plaister, and apply to the part. 

[}For the CRAMP.}]
To stretch the limbs out, and move the toes 
about briskly. 

[}A WASH FOR THE LADIES FACES. }]
Take Oil of Bitter Almonds two ounces, Oil 
of Tartar par Deliquium one ounce, Oil of 
Rhodium four drops, shake them together till 
thoroughly mixed. It may be lowered with 
|P_44
Pump ## Rose-water. It is a fine cream colour, 
and will make the skin admirably smooth and 
white, and free it from specks or pimples. 

[}A FEW SIMPLE EFFICACIOUS RECEIPTS. }]
[}For the HICCUP. }]
Take a wine bottle cork, and hold it between 
the teeth longways for three minutes. 

[}An easy EYE WATER. }]
Take Brandy one table-spoonful, and three of 
Spring-water, mix them together. 

[}ANOTHER EYE WATER. }]
Take Sugar of Lead two grains, dissolve it in 
a pint of Spring-water.—For sore eyes, the Oint-
ment of Tutty is good. 

[}BEEF TEA. }]
Cut a pound of lean Beef into very thin slices, 
add to it a quart of Water, put it over a quick 
fire, let it boil five minutes, take off the scum, and 
decant the liquor for use. 

[}TINCTURE OF RHUBARB. }]
There are three forts, the Spirituous, the Vi-
nous, and the Bitter. This Tincture is a proper 
|P_45
purge in loosenesses, vomitings, cholics #s, 
&c. Dose from two drams to an ounce. 

[}SACRED TINCTURE. }]
It cleanses the first passages, attenuates viscid 
juices, warms the blood, is good in the green 
sickness, and hysteric diseases, and promotes the 
menses. Dose from one tea-spoon full to one 
ounce; it purges easily—An Aloetic medicine. 

[}The VOLALILE AROMATIC TINCTURE. }]
Volatile Salts thus united with Aromatics, are 
very agreeable, and more acceptable to the sto-
mach; good to smell at; dose is five drops to 
sixty, in wine and water. 

[}TINCTURE OF HIERAPICRA. }]
Take of Succotrine Aloes powdered one ounce, 
Lesser Cardamon Seeds, and Virginia Snake 
Root each one dram, Cochineal one scruple, Spa-
nish White Wine one pint and half, digest it in a 
very gentle heat two days, then strain off the 
Tincture. This is similar to the Sacred Tincture. 
Dose from one tea-spoon full to four, in Wine, 
or any other liquor: it purges gently. 

[}TINCTURE OF CASTOR. }]
This Tincture is recommended in most kinds 
of nervous complaints and hysteric disorders; 
|P_46
dose from twenty drops to fifty, or more. A 
safe medicine. 

In order to furnish those who may chuse ele-
gant distilled Spirituous Waters, I recommend 
the following, which may be kept in common 
bottles, viz. 

[}SPIRITOUS ALEXETERIAL WATER, }]
Is tolerably pleasant, and is an Alexipharmic 
and Stomachic, used in Juleps. 

[}CARRAWAY WATER. }]
A cordial in common use, good for the wind. 

[}SPIRITUOUS CINNAMON WATER, }]
Is an agreeable, grateful cordial water, it is a 
great astringent, and good in fluxes. 

N.B. It is hard to get good Cinnamon Bark, 
as the Dutch frequently draw the oil out first, 
before it comes over; for this reason I have 
often recommended the Cassia, for a Spirituous 
Water, which, when good, makes an agreeable 
water. 

[}AROMATIC WATER; 
OR AQUA MIRABILIS. }]
Take Cinnamon two ounces, fresh Yellow Rind 
of Lemons, and Angelica Seeds each one ounce, 
|P_47
Mace half an ounce, Pepper Mint three #####, 
French Wine one gallon, digest it for two days, 
and then distil off one gallon. This Water is 
very rich of the spices, and proves a pleasant 
warm cordial and carminative; it often gives 
present relief in languors, flatulencies, cholicky 
pains, and other like complaints. 

[}NUTMEG WATER. }]
This Water is regarded only as an agreeable 
spirituous liquor, lightly impregnated with the 
Nutmeg flavour. 

[}SPIRITUOUS PENNY-ROYAL WATER. }]
This Water has great share of the flavour of 
the Penny-Royal, and is pretty much in use as a 
carminative and anti-hysteric. 

[}SPIRITUOUS JAMAICA PEPPER WATER. }]
This Water is far more agreeable than a simple 
water drawn from the same spice, and has long 
had a place among the cordials, both of the dis-
tiller and apothecary; though it has not yet 
been received into any public Pharmacopæia. 

[}HYSTERIC JULEP. }]
Take Penny-royal Water four ounces, Com-
pound Valerian Water two ounces, Tincture of 
Castor two drachms, Salt of Hartshorn ten grains, 
|P_48
and loaf Sugar six drams. The dose two table-
spoons full every four or six hours; it is calcu-
lated against hysteric and paralytic disorders. 

[}STOMACHIC TINCTURE. }]
Take of Raisins stoned four ounces, Cinna-
mon half an ounce, Carraway Seeds, Lesser 
Candamoms hulk'd, and Cochineal, each two 
drams, Proof Spirit two pints. This is a grateful, 
elegant cordial Tincture, pleasanter than the Us-
quebaugh, and may be taken from half an ounce 
to an ounce. 

[}SNUFF FOR THE HEAD-ACH. }]
Take of Betony, Lavender Flowers, and Mar-
jarom, of the leaves of each equal parts, beat them 
together into powder. This Snuff may be safely 
used in all complaints of the head: it is prepared 
from herbs which have a particular efficacy in 
those cases, as it is manifest from the infinite ser-
vice from it in old and settled pains of the head. 
It may be taken as freely as you please. 

[}NERVOUS TINCTURE. }]
Take Russia Castor one ounce, Assafœtida 
half an ounce, Spirit of Sal Volatile one pint, di-
gest them for ten days in a close stopped phial, 
frequently shaking the vessel, and then strain off 
the Tincture. This Tincture is very serviceable in 
lowness of spirits, faintings, and hysterical cases; 
|P_49
the dose is from one to two tea-spoons full two 
or three times a day, in a glass of Wine a #####Wa-
ter or Valerian. 

[}OPODELDOC }]
Is very serviceable in bruises and strains; it 
should be rubbed in with the warm hand three or 
four times a day. 

[}TO SWEETEN THE BREATH. }]
At night going to bed chew about the quan-
tity of a small nut of fine Myrrh. 

[}Of the Number of SIMPLE WATERS, the fol-
lowing are the best. }]
Viz. Mint — Pepper Mint — Penny-Royal — 
Rose —Cinnamon and Fennel Water. The dried 
herbs kept and made into infusions as wanted, I 
think is better. Observe in making of infusions, 
let not the water stand too long on the ingredients, 
for in all infusions, tinctures, &c. the finer par-
ticles are drawn out first. 

There are several other medicines you may 
put into a chest, that are not mentioned in the 
scheme; as the Sweet and Acid Spirit of Vitriol, 
Sacred Tincture, Stomach Tincture, Nervous 
Tincture, Liquid Laudanum, Calomel, a Mercu-
rial Powder, Tincture of Castor, the Spirit Vo-
latile Aromatic, Tincture of Rhubarb, Eau de 
Luce, Lavender and Rosemary Water, &c. and as 
|P_50
Powders, keep better in bottles than drawers, I 
have ordered some bottles in the 12 and 16 chests 
to be made with wide mouths. Since the first 
publication of this book, I have considered and 
made an estimate of several chests, and those who 
have honoured me with their commands, have 
thought me reasonable: in order that the public 
may judge, I will lay the particulars before them. 

Each chest is neatly made of mahogany wood, 
with brass handles and locks; the bottles are 
square, with glass stoppers, holding either an 
ounce or two ounces; labeled, and filled with 
the particular medicines.

dicine sufficient to answer domestic purposes, till 
further assistance can be procured. There are 
some receipts which I have put down, which, 
because they are simple and easy, may create a 
laugh, though they are a sure remedy for the 
complaint. 

All letters, post paid, will be duly answered, 
and Chests sent according to the directions given.
