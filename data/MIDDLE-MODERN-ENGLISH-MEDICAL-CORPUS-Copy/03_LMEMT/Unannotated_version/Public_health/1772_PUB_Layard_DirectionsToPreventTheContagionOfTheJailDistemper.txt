[}DIRECTIONS 
TO PREVENT THE 
CONTAGION, &c. }]
THE Jail-fever, so well 
known to be contagious, 
and of all fevers, nearly as fatal, 
as the plague, affects both places, 
and persons. Sir John Prin- 
gle's, and Sir Stephen Theo- 
dore Janssen's accounts are 
almost in the hands of every one, 
whether of the faculty, or not. 
The Physician in his Treatise on 
Army Diseases, has not only fully 
described this fever, but most 
judiciously directed the proper 
|P_2
method of cure. The Chamber- 
lain in his Letter, has given a full 
account, of the melancholy ca- 
tastrophe in the year 1750, of 
his great activity, and diligence, 
in removing the causes, and en- 
deavouring to prevent its conti- 
nuance, and return; in which 
humane offices, the late Reverend, 
and most benevolent Doctor Ste- 
phen Hales distinguished him- 
self by his usual unwearied 
attention, and charitable zeal. 
From the remarks and observa- 
tions of those worthy persons 
above mentioned; from the suc- 
cess which attended their endea- 
vors; from some considerations 
which have since arisen on the 
|P_3
progress of infection in other 
cases; the following directions 
are drawn up, in order to con- 
tribute a small mite, towards the 
preservation of our fellow crea- 
tures. 

To be as distinct as possible, 
the placing these directions un- 
der two particular, and separate 
heads, will appear necessary; 
since they may relate to different 
persons, who may be induced 
more particularly to attend to 
one, or other consideration. 
Therefore they are divided into 
directions relative to 1st, Prisons, 
and Prisoners. 2dly, to Courts of 
Justice, and Attendants on Courts of 
|P_4
Justice, which comprehend the 
places and persons, usually af- 
fected; and from whence, and 
from whom, this pestilential fe- 
ver is too often communicated 
to society. 

|P_5
[}1. Prisons, and Prisoners. }]
PRISONS are not only like 
 hospitals, the receptacle of 
the sick, unhealthy, and help- 
less; but are too frequently 
crouded, with the healthy, 
strong, vigorous, cleanly and 
decently habited, together with 
the infirm, weak, feeble, filthy, 
and naked. Accustomed to every 
hardship, which the most abject 
poverty can suffer, the one are 
inured to misery, by the depra- 
vity of their minds; and vice 
rooted in their hearts, keeping 
them bound in the chains of 
|P_6
wickedness, they are totally 
changed in constitution, as much 
as in principles; and both filth 
and disease are become as natu- 
ral to them as cleanliness and 
health are to the virtuous and 
industrious. The other, who per- 
haps, before the slight offence, 
for which they were committed, 
lived comfortably in their several 
stations; bring into their con- 
finement, that share of health, 
and decency in apparel which 
they have hitherto enjoyed. 
The bold offender hardened in 
iniquity, and proof against the 
inclemencies of the weather, 
and the severities of pinching 
famine and distress; feels not 
|P_7
the horrors, and miseries of 
a jail; nor is he so easily seiz- 
ed with any disease; but ra- 
ther finds an Asylum, in his pri- 
son, from cold, and hunger; 
and in return, adds more poiso- 
nous, and baneful steams from 
his breath, and body, to increase 
the stock of contagion, and de- 
stroy others. The unhappy and 
wretched criminal, overtaken by 
justice, in his first offence, and 
perhaps sometimes, the still more 
pitiable innocent, abashed, de- 
jected, and forlorn, fallen from 
ease, comfort, and regard; thrown 
 into chains, among the most a- 
bandoned, too soon falls alike a 
prey to despondency, and disease; 
|P_8
and the share of health, brought 
in with them exposes them, the 
sooner, to every sort of infection. 
Such a motly set of beings croud- 
ed together, breathing the same 
infectious air, which daily grows 
more pestilential as the healthy 
grow more corrupt, produce 
such an acrid, powerful and de- 
structive change in it, that no 
wonder the very walls are in- 
fected with the noxious vapours. 

The total extinction of so pu- 
trid a disease, as the jail-fever, 
can scarcely be expected, not- 
withstanding the utmost atten- 
tion, and care. Ever since Sir 
Stephen Janssen's Shrievalty, 
|P_9
the keeper of Newgate is allowed 
to have done all in his power, 
by the working of Dr. Hales's 
ventilators, and by proper clean- 
sing, and washing, to keep the 
jail free from stench, and foul 
air. But the constant increase 
of prisoners, which prolong the 
sessions more and more every 
sitting; the filthy, and distem- 
pered state, in which the prison- 
ers, from other jails, generally 
are, when removed about a week 
before their trials; the admission 
of country convicts, sentenced 
for transportation; and the de- 
tention of the transports of all 
sorts, and condition, promiscu- 
ously, at least till two sessions are 
|P_10
over, for the convenience of the 
contractor, that he may ship off 
a number together; the remain- 
ing of some, till their fees are 
discharged, the want of an infir- 
mary for the sick, and of private 
separate lodgings for the healthy, 
unless they are able to pay for 
them; all, and even a few of 
these causes, are fully sufficient, 
to perpetuate a disease; and when 
the changes of the season are also 
attended to, it is not surprising, 
that even sometimes in private 
houses, and in hospitals where 
the greatest cleanliness is obser- 
ved; and much more in jails, 
where it is not always to be met 
with; the spring and autumn 
|P_11
should bring forth pestilential fe- 
vers, especially in the latter, when 
heavy rains have succeeded to a 
hot summer, which, this very 
year, has been the case. 

As the sheriffs of London are 
likewise officers for the county 
of Middlesex, their jurisdiction ex- 
tends, most probably, over the 
several prisons of London and West- 
minster. The proper officers how- 
ever should order, that all the 
jails be thoroughly inspected by 
their under officers, and direc- 
tions positively given, that every 
ward, room, or apartment in 
the jail, should be well swept, 
washed first with warm water, 
|P_12
then scraped, and afterwards 
washed with vinegar; the boil- 
ing hot steams of which might 
be usefully conveyed to every 
part: then the ventilators 
should be worked to carry off 
the confined air, and pour in 
fresh. Afterwards the several 
rooms should be smoaked with 
tobacco stalks burnt on charcoal, 
the room being closely shut; pitch, 
or tar may also be burnt; the 
last is more agreeable to the 
smell, and not so gross as pitch. 
Different wards should be allot- 
ted to the clean, or filthy; the 
prisoners should be obliged to 
comb, shave, wash, and make 
|P_13
themselves as clean as they could 
before their removal from the 
distant jails to Newgate. The 
men who can smoak tobacco 
might be allowed to smoak, with 
safety from fire; at least the ser- 
vants of the jails should, for their 
own preservation, be induced to 
smoak. 

Every jail should have both a 
kitchen, and an infirmary; the 
first to prepare, at a proper dis- 
tance, broths, and such boiled 
meats as charitable persons in 
this humane country frequently 
send to the prisoners; and the 
infirmary to remove therein the 
distressed sick for their cure, 
|P_14
and the preservation of others. 
Were the magistrates of London
and Middlesex to appoint a phy- 
sician of abilities, with the name 
of City-Physician, and a suitable, 
proper, and comfortable salary, 
to visit daily one or other of the 
jails; two surgeons, one in Lon- 
don and another in Westminster, 
and an Apothecary to each prison, 
under the direction of the phy- 
sician, who should report to 
the mayor, aldermen, and she- 
riffs, the state of the jails. No 
doubt but that from among the 
worthy practitioners in the 
army, and navy, who have 
been conversant in the diseases 
of camps, fleets, and hospitals, 
|P_15
proper persons may be found: 
and at a moderate expence, the 
community will be ever obliged 
to those magistrates, who will 
put such a plan into execution. 
Another very necessary consider- 
ation, is the carrying off of all 
excrementitious matter by pro- 
per severs, through which such 
a run of water should constantly 
flow, as to cleanse the privies, 
and carry off every sort of filth 
immediately and to a great dis- 
tance. 

The transports should not be 
closely confined, but, could it be 
practised, should so soon as con- 
venient after trial, be sentenced, 
|P_16
and put in a safe, but more airy 
place of custody. Could even 
a distinct transport-prison be 
built, wherein the healthy and 
unhealthy might be put sepa- 
rately, till the transport-ship 
was near ready to sail; and were 
all the transports from the 
inland counties immediately 
brought from the assize towns, 
to that prison; many lives might 
be saved, and, not only to the 
benefit of the contractor, but it 
is to be hoped also, to the ad- 
vantage of society, and the eter- 
nal happiness of many an un- 
happy, and miserable soul. 
Nothing seems more evident, 
than that a transport-jail, con- 
|P_17
sisting of different wards, for 
men and women; of an infirm- 
ary for the sick, and a very 
spacious piece of ground to air 
the prisoners in, would be of in- 
finite use. Such a prison, erect- 
ed at a proper distance from 
town, by the river side, may be 
convenient, safe, and not so ex- 
pensive, as the ground may be 
had cheaper, and less building 
may be necessary, where a deep 
wide ditch, supplied with water 
constantly from the Thames, 
would prevent the escape of the 
felons, which walls, unless very 
thick and strong, could not always 
prevent: The Isle of Dogs seems 
a proper place for the situation 
|P_18
of such a prison, and it might 
be guarded at little expence by a 
detachment of invalids: the very 
sight of whose muskets, would 
awe, and secure, more than bars, 
bolts or chains. The infirmary 
of the transport-prison should al- 
so be under the care of the City 
Physician, and Surgeons, and have a 
distinct apothecary resident or 
living in the neighbourhood 
to attend it. As it frequent- 
ly, nay after every session hap- 
pens, that persons sentenced 
for transportation are set at li- 
berty, by his Majesty's most gra- 
cious pardon, on account of some 
favourable circumstances appear- 
ing in their behalf, and the small 
amount, or value of the theft 
|P_19
committed; what mischief, to 
society, must ensue, when such a 
felon, infected with the jail-di- 
stemper, is let loose from the 
midst of infection, and spreads 
the contagion. No one circum- 
stance is more dangerous, except 
the aggravated one of the dread- 
ful consequences, which may fol- 
low the conveying the infected 
prisoners in the day-time, from 
the different jails to Newgate, and 
from that prison, dragging the 
miserable objects to the lighters 
for exportation, the sight and 
stench whereof are shocking to 
human nature. 

The care and management of 
|P_20
the prisoners in regard to their 
health, require as much atten- 
tion, as the building, or conve- 
nience of the prison; while the 
effluvia of the jail distemper are 
continually rising from a croud 
of miserable wretches, the ac- 
tive poison will not spare any 
being, or thing, but will soon 
fix itself into the very walls; the 
dust, and moisture from the 
steams and infected air, will ga- 
ther in time, and serving all the 
while as a nest for insects of va- 
rious sorts to fix, live, breed in, 
die, and rot; they continually 
increase, succeed each other, 
and add still more to the putrid 
air of the place. Hence it must 
|P_21
occur, that every lodgment of dirt, 
and filth, must be cleared away, 
as the diligent and active alder- 
man Janssen caused to be done 
in his shrievalty; and also the 
prisoners, even though cleaned 
before their removal from other 
jails to Newgate, should again, 
before their trials, be combed, 
shaved, washed, and have their 
nails cut; a few of them at a 
time should be daily aired in 
the prison yard, they should not 
be crouded in their apartments, 
and whatever their allowance 
may be according to their seve- 
ral situations, both their food, 
and their drink, should be so 
mixed, and distributed, that a 
|P_22
proper quantity of bread, rice, 
vegetables and acids, should be 
given them, but not meat only 
and spirituous liquors undiluted, 
which would soon destroy their 
health under confinement. It 
has been observed, that no 
sooner are the convicts under 
transportation, on the river, 
although crouded on board 
the lighters, than they grow 
better, and daily recover their 
health, which after the trans- 
port-ship is clear from the chan- 
nel, and they are allowed the 
liberty to come upon deck, is 
firmly established so soon as the 
sea sickness is over; but that 
when the lighter falls down im- 
mediately on their being put on 
|P_23
board, and that the ship sails 
away, the sea sickness affects 
them so much, that many die 
before the ship leaves the land, 
and others remain ill a long 
while. Probably the joy of 
being out of prison, and, though 
under hatches, yet breathing a 
somewhat purer air, the fresh, 
and cool night breezes from the 
shore, the hope to some of being 
yet released from their sentence, 
may give that degree of strength, 
which enables them to bear 
the shocks of the sea sickness, 
which if they survive, and are 
not thereby too much weaken- 
ed, must necessarily by so tho- 
rough an evacuation, both clear 
|P_24
their bodies, and amend their 
constitution. Since therefore it 
is plain that the convicts for 
transportation grow better in the 
lighters, may it not be expedi- 
ent to sentence, and send off every 
night such felons, as have been 
tried in the day, and put them 
on board the lighter at Black- 
friars, which could take in also 
the other prisoners sentenced at 
the different quarter sessions, 
without crouding Newgate with 
them; and when all were on 
board should fall down the river 
to the transport-ship, or trans- 
port-prison, when one may be 
erected, and properly fitted up. 

|P_25
But as the erecting of a trans- 
port-prison, may, for obvious 
reasons, be the work of time, 
would it not prove a good tem- 
porary expedient, to purchase a 
large ship of war, which, when 
properly fitted up, might serve 
as a transport-prison, with con- 
veniencies both for the healthy, 
and sick; and which ship should 
be anchored or moored in some 
part of the river, the most 
convenient to secure the pri- 
soners; low enough from the 
capital, and so distant from 
shore, as to prevent any com- 
munication of infection. 

Having considered the root 
of the evil from whence the jail- 
|P_26
distemper is produced and 
spread; and endeavoured to 
direct, and point out, the means 
of preventing the fatal effects of 
the contagion, both as to the 
prisons, and prisoners; the next 
consideration, is to prevent courts 
of justice from being infected, 
and persons of all denominations 
who attend, from receiving the 
pestilential contagion. 

|P_27
[}2. Of Courts of Justice, and 
Attendants on Courts of 
Justice. }]
IT is past all doubt, that every 
crouded place when close, al- 
though clean, and pure before 
the meeting, becomes offensive 
by the number of persons pressing 
on each other, their several mix- 
ed breaths, and the want of air. 
The fatal and melancholy events 
during the black assizes at Oxford, 
the sessions at the Old Bailey, and 
in the Black Hole at Calcutta, are 
sufficient proofs of the destruction 
caused by close confinement, and 
infection. The walls of a court 
|P_28
of justice are not so liable to re- 
tain the putrid effluvia of conta- 
gious air, as those of a prison, 
which is constantly inhabited and 
filled. Provided therefore, that 
the court room be frequently 
swept, dusted, and washed, and 
the coverings of the seats, whe- 
ther of cloth or matting, be 
often cleaned and renewed, the 
air contained in that court will 
be found pure and untainted. 
But should the requisite cleaning 
be omitted, and the dirt be suf- 
fered to gather to such a degree 
as Mr. Sheriff Janssen found in 
the Sessions House, the same ca- 
lamity may ensue, by the repeat- 
ed collection of infection, and 
|P_29
insects, which the succeeding 
sessions, distempered prisoners, 
and length of time to increase 
the quantity of insects, may pro- 
duce. To preserve a court room 
sweet, and temperate, and whole_
some; it should be built in so spa- 
cious a manner as to admit a suf- 
ficient number of auditors with- 
out obstructing their ease, or 
hindering the sound of every 
voice, whether of the judge, the 
jury, prisoner or witnesses, from 
being distinctly heard, in all 
parts of the room. By means 
of ventilators, judiciously placed 
above, by air-holes made with 
flap-doors at the bottom near 
the ground, and by tubes placed 
|P_30
to admit fresh air, and let the 
foul out, a court-room may be 
kept sweet and temperate. But 
from open windows, ventilators, 
or tubes, the respectable bench 
may be annoyed, and the cold 
air rushing in, may strike 
one or other of them with 
acute or chronic diseases. Some 
sort of contrivance then must be 
made to shelter those vene- 
rable Magistrates and Judges, 
from the mischief they are 
exposed to. Were a back 
cove, like that made to a seat 
in a summer-house, brought 
over their heads, so as to cover 
them from the air, without 
coming too forward, the air 
|P_31
from above could not then be 
at all felt: it is indeed object- 
ed, that such a cove would ob- 
struct the light; expert work- 
men, on examining the court- 
room, could easily, either by 
means of a sky-light, or some 
other contrivance, remove this 
objection; and were the room 
kept temperate, candle-light 
might be had only a little soon- 
er. To guard the seat of justice 
from the approaches of infec- 
tion, it will certainly be most 
prudent to fumigate, and steam 
the place, by means of large 
braziers, pans, or coppers, put 
in the day before the sessions 
are to commence; and during 
that day to burn in them char- 
|P_32
coal, with tobacco stalks, and 
dried aromatic herbs in winter, 
as mint, rosemary, southern-wood, 
&c. bruised juniper berries may 
also be burnt; and on a hot iron 
shovel may be put wet gun- 
powder, and frankincense; but 
particularly the steams of boiling 
hot vinegar should be conveyed 
to all parts of the building,
The next morning, about an 
hour or two before the court 
met, the braziers should be filled 
with Coke Cinders, as used by 
maltsters, instead of charcoal, and 
after they shall have burned a 
while, the ventilator should let 
in fresh air, and the floor should 
be sprinkled with cold vinegar of 
|P_33
the sharpest sort. At the time 
of opening the court, the air- 
holes, made close to the ground, 
about a foot square, should be set 
open, and the wooden flaps 
hooked up. 

These cautions with regard to 
the building will avail little, if a 
due regard be not also had to 
the manner of communicating 
the infection. The prisoners 
therefore, who are brought from 
the infected jail, or even the 
crouded healthy jail, should, af- 
ter the thorough cleansing, as 
above mentioned, be brought 
into the Bail Dock but a few at a 
time, and some method should 
|P_34
be resolved upon, to have but a 
small number arraigned at once; 
and at such a convenient distance 
from the bench and court, as to 
be well heard, and seen by the 
jury, without annoying either 
by their stench. A proper dress 
might be also contrived with 
which the most wretched should 
be so covered, as not to prove 
offensive. As for instance, were 
a long loose cloak, like a carter's 
frock, made of thick close Russia
or other linnen on the outside, 
and lined with some sort of oil 
cloth, or glazed linnen, to be 
fastened close to the neck and 
wrists, and along the body, with 
hooks and eyes, covered over 
|P_35
with a broad flap of the same 
linnen; and this cloak or frock 
made to reach down to their 
feet, so as to cover them closely, 
and entirely: but no woollen, or 
hairy substance can be made use 
of, being well known to contract, 
and preserve infection. When 
the prisoners have no further oc- 
casion for these coverings, they 
may be washed, fumigated with 
brimstone, and afterwards wet 
with vinegar. While the court 
is sitting, great relief, and re- 
freshment might be procured, 
by burning tar in the yard, now 
and then, which would exhale 
such an agreeable smell, as, car- 
ried by the draught of air into 
|P_36
court, would refresh all present. 
A very eminent and distinguish- 
ed gentleman of the law, made 
the following most judicious, and 
sagacious observation: One even- 
ing late, at a jail-delivery, when 
a number of miserable objects 
were to be discharged, they were 
ushered in, by the servants of 
the jail, who lighted them with 
links. Two of these men pla- 
ced themselves, with their burn- 
ing links, on each side of the 
bench, which gave this gentleman 
much uneasiness; but, to his 
great comfort and surprize, he 
soon found, that the heat of the 
links dispelled the hot offensive 
air, and filled the whole court 
|P_37
with the most reviving scent 
imaginable. This incident may 
serve to shew of what use it will 
necessarily be on the breaking up 
of every day's session, to intro- 
duce persons with burning links, 
which will contribute much to 
purify the air: and when the 
court is adjourned, the disagree- 
able smell of the pitch will not 
be in the least offensive to those 
who are burning it; and thus 
pitch will be best adapted at 
night, and tar most suitable and 
pleasing in the day-time. 

The many attendants on Courts 
of Justice, who require our ut- 
most care and earnestness for 
|P_38
their preservation, are either, 
the several magistrates on the 
bench, or the different officers 
of justice; the jury; prosecu- 
tors; witnesses; and audience. 
The former are under the irk- 
some necessity of being confined 
to their duty in court several 
hours, while the others of the 
three last mentioned classes may 
retire, when their business is 
over, if they choose it. The 
most exalted place is the most 
exposed to the danger of the efflu- 
via, therefore the bench is the 
soonest sensible of the morbid im- 
pression, being in the front, and 
the galleries are next affected. 
To preserve such valuable lives, 
|P_39
it may not be improper, and it is 
to be hoped not indifferent, to 
suggest what caution should be 
observed by them, and what steps 
should be taken, first to avoid 
the infection, or should they 
fear it, to secure themselves in 
time from its invasion and con- 
sequences. 

Whoever is obliged, or chooses 
to attend the trials of criminals, 
especially in crouded courts, 
should begin by first resolving 
most courageously, not to be af- 
fected with the least dread of 
whatever he may smell or feel; 
by the direction of his physician, 
he should prudently empty his 
|P_40
stomach and bowels a few days 
before, to carry off any putrid 
or putrescent substance which 
may have lodged in them; and 
this is done very easily by a suit- 
able mild purge. The diet which 
such persons should observe, is 
the mere abstaining from all 
gross, heavy, spicy, and viscid 
food; by eating well-dressed 
light meats, and drinking, in mo- 
deration, of true cordial wines, 
as claret, port, and old hock;
brandy or rum punch acidulated
with oranges, lemons, limes, or
tamarinds, so as to exhilarate,
promote a gentle perspiration, 
and prevent dejection of the
|P_41
mind, or lassitude of the body. 
By such means it is likely no one 
need fear infection, or shrink 
from his duty; but should, on 
the contrary, any one, unfortu- 
nately either be infected by the 
jail-distemper, or even appre- 
hend, without cause, that he 
has contracted that disease, by 
his attendance at a Court of Ju- 
stice, let him without delay apply 
to his physician, and tell him 
where he has been, and what 
are his sensations, and fears. 
The skilful physician will soon 
discover whether the complaints 
are well grounded or not; whe- 
ther there is a real infection, or 
barely the apprehensions of it. 
|P_42
He will put his patient into such 
a course of medicines as will se- 
cure him from all mischief; and, 
instead of hurrying him into 
danger, as many have been, 
when the infectious jail-distem- 
per has been treated like an in- 
flammatory fever, the expe- 
rienced physician will carry his 
patient through the contagious 
illness with safety and success; 
and will be happy in seeing him 
much sooner restored to his for- 
mer health and vigour. 

But should any person be un- 
awares suddenly surprized, and 
frightened with any alarming, 
or disagreeable sensation, the 
|P_43
following recital will serve to di- 
rect him in what is to be done, 
and will quiet his mind. An 
eminent person in the law being 
on the bench, felt at once a 
shock which affected him from 
the top of his head, down to his 
very feet, like a stroke of elec- 
tricity, which was followed by a 
sickness at his stomach, and a 
most uncommon stench in his 
nose. Unwilling to be fanciful, 
he kept his anxious feelings a 
while to himself, hoping that if no 
one had felt the like, it would on- 
ly prove imaginary; in a few mi- 
nutes another venerable lawyer 
on the bench asked the former, 
|P_44
whether he had not felt an un- 
common sensation; which con- 
vincing the first of the reality of 
the infection, he instantly answer- 
ed in the affirmative, and pre- 
vailed on his colleague to drink 
a glass of brandy, by which they 
probably expelled the deleteri- 
ous air from their stomachs. 

It is to be hoped, that no person 
will venture into a court of jus- 
tice, any more than a prison, 
without breaking their fast. 
The infection will soon affect a 
person with an empty stomach: 
whatever be the usual food, will 
best answer the intention, with- 
out burning the stomach with spi- 
|P_45
rits or spices. To keep out the 
foul air while in court, candied 
orange or lemon peel, preserved 
ginger, and garlic if not dis- 
agreeable, cardamom, carra- 
way, or other comfits, may be 
very useful; and should the 
mouth be clammed, dry raisins, 
currants, or lemon drops, will 
cool, and quench thirst, which, 
should it increase, may be as- 
suaged by small draughts of old 
hock and water, or small punch. 
Smelling to good wine vinegar 
during the trials, will not only 
refresh, but revive, more agree- 
ably and coolly, than the use of 
spirituous waters distilled from 
|P_46
lavender or rosemary, and more 
than any other scents. 

These are the directions which 
the late alarming appearances of 
the jail-distemper suggested; 
they are hastily thrown together 
for the service of the communi- 
ty in general, and great pleasure 
with the keenest satisfaction, will
be felt, should any individual 
think himself benefited by them. 

FINIS.
