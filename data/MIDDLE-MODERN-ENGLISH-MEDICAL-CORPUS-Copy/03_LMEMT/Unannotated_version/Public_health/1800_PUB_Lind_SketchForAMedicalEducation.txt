[}SKETCH for a MEDICAL 
EDUCATION. by J*L. M D. F R S. }]
After having attained a competent 
knowledge of the Languages necessary 
to acquire those Sciences that are requisite 
to the study of Medicine; and to enable 
the Student to read and consult the va- 
rious Authors that have written on Phy- 
sic. MATHEMATICS claims his first 
attention. 

Without the knowledge of Mathe- 
matics it is impossible to understand NA- 
TURAL PHILOSOPHY, a Science by 
which the Laws, and Oeconomy of na- 
ture, and the Human body, can only be 
understood; as also the many causes that 
operate upon men and all nature. 

ANATOMY being the foundation 
of medical knowledge, it is therefore to 
be studied with the greatest care and 
attention. Its intricacy also requires the 
aid of the best Professors; and that the 
Pupil himself practice frequent dissections 
to attain this most necessary part of a 
Medical Education. Without the know- 
ledge of Anatomy, it is impossible either 
|P_2
to discover the seat, nature, or cure, of 
Diseases. In Surgery no operation can 
be performed with safety or with much 
probability of success to the Patient. 
From dissections he likewise learns the 
nature of many hidden Disorders, and 
when similar symptoms occur to know 
the Disease under which the Patient la- 
bours. It also enables, the Physician or 
Surgeon when called upon by a Court 
of Justice, to determine with certainty 
whether Death has been occasioned from 
a natural cause, or from violence; hence 
he becomes the means of acquitting the 
innocent, and of condemning the guilty; 
but if ignorant of Anatomy, perhaps the 
contrary. 

CHEMISTRY is an other necessary 
part of a Medical Education, as with- 
out a knowledge of it we must ever be ig- 
norant of the various chemical Processes 
that are constantly going on in the Ani- 
mal oeconomy upon whom depends health 
or disease, and from a true knowledge of 
whom, we are greatly instucted how to 
preserve the first, and to cure the latter 
also the Physician is liable to give Pre- 
scriptions that cannot be compounded or 
|P_3
if they could, He is ignorant of the 
means by which it can be done. Some 
efficacious medicines he frequently des- 
troys by his injudicious compositions, 
while other substances even innocent and 
inert ones, are rendered injurious and 
highly poisonous. 

A knowledge of the MATERIA- 
MEDICA is also necessary to every prac- 
titioner of Medicine, without which he is 
ignorant of the means of cure, notwith- 
standing the Disease is known to him: 
Also, altho he is acquainted with the 
powers of a few medicines, he will find 
himself foiled for want of a more extended 
knowledge of the Materia-Medica, the 
constitutions of some people, differing as 
much from that of mankind in general: 
as if they were of a different Species. 
Therefore what proves useful in a dis- 
ease with most people, with some it 
may be injurious. 

The Materia-Medica being an ex- 
tensive Science, requiring the aid of me- 
thod, BOTANY and NATURAL-HIS- 
TORY should therefore make a part of 
the education of every Physician; the 
knowledge of them also helps to abridge 
|P_4
the study of the Materia-Medica, there 
being frequently an analogy in the vir- 
tues of bodies of the same Genus. 

Lectures on the THEORY of ME- 
DICINE, may now be studied. In this 
course is also taught PHYSEOLOGY & 
PATHOLOGY, both absolutely requi- 
site to a Medical Education. Although 
the different Systems of Physic are im- 
perfect, yet as they serve for a clew to 
guide and direct a Physician in his pro- 
cedure of Cure, by keeping him from 
confounding one thing with an other, 
they are therefore of the greatest utility 
in the Practice of Medicine; more espe- 
cially as all Practitioners have a natural 
tendancy to empiricism. 

The PRACTICE of PHYSIC is 
the last, and chief design, of medical 
study. This part of medical knowledge 
is to be attained from hearing the Lectu- 
res of eminent Professors, and by reading, 
but particularly by attending Hospitals, 
where Clinical Lectures are delivered 
to the Students, in which are generally 
given the History of the Disease under 
which the Patient labours, the purpose 
proposed, for the administering, of this 
|P_5
or that medicine, and their effects up- 
on the Patient pointed out; lastly if the 
patient dies, the cause of his death is 
more evidently pointed out and shown 
to the Students, by the dissecton of the 
morbid body.
