[}Reasons, why the Apothecary 
may be supposed to understand 
the Administration of Medi-
cines in the Cure of Diseases, 
as well as the Physician. }]
SIR, 

YOU have at length found 
the most effectual means 
to prevail with me, to 
break thro' the resolution I had 
taken, of having no share in the 
present Controversie between the 
Physicians and the Apothecarys, by 
imputing my Silence to the bad-
ness of my Cause: In the Vindi-
cation of which, you are pleas'd 
|P_4
to say, no Sober or Ingenious Per-
son will offer to draw his Pen. 

I must confess, I have hitherto 
been of the Opinion of the Major 
part of our Profession; that what 
has yet appear'd in publick against 
us, has not deserv'd a serious An-
swer, most of it being taken up 
on Prejudice, the rest a Scandalous 
Aspersion, invented by a peevish 
Set of Men, who were angry 
that any body thriv'd beside them-
selves. 

Thus then have you unwilling-
ly forced me into a spacious Field, 
where on each side I may extend 
and dilate my self; and which 
way soever I turn, may find at 
least quantum sufficit of Matter to 
Work upon. 

But since you keep a more than 
ordinary pother with the high Ad-
vantages which the Physicians have 
|P_5
over us, I shall chuse to examine 
the truth of that Assertion, and en-
deavour to set those High Advan-
tages, (as you call 'em) in a true 
light; and then leave the Impar-
tial World to Judge, whether all be 
Gospel which proceeds from 
the Pen of a Dispensary Physician.

And first it is pretended, That 
the Phsician, by his liberal Educa-
tion, (that is, by being bred at 
an Academy) has greater and more 
frequent opportunities of being 
instructed in the Practice of Phy-
sick, than the Apothecary can have; 
and that not only from his own 
private Reading and Observation, 
the Care and Direction of his 
Tutor, but also from the publick 
Lectures of the Physick Professor. 

Now if it be expected that this 
Argument should have any force 
against us, it must first be prov'd 
|P_6
what extraordinary Benefits those 
are which Young Students receive 
from Tutors and Physick Pro-
fessors; and not think that we 
shall barely assent to them, or be-
lieve them to be such mighty 
things upon their single Affirma-
tion. I fear when these wonder-
ful Lectures come to be examin'd, 
they will appear little better than 
Barren Animadversions on Galen, 
Hippocrates, or some other of the 
old Physical Authours; which e-
very Man is capable of doing, who 
is able to read and understand 
them. And I believe we may ven-
ture to add, that the Auditors of 
these Lectures generally return 
with the same degree of Know-
ledge and Satisfaction, as a late 
Assembly did from a Lecture at 
Exeter-Exchange, against the Cir-
culation of the Blood.

|P_7
It is again Objected against us, 
That the Opportunities of being 
Advanc'd in the Knowledge of 
Anatomy and Chymistry, so essential 
to the Qualification of a Person 
who is to Administer Physick, are 
greater in the Academy than in any 
other place; and from whence the 
Apothecary is totally excluded. 

It must be allow'd, that the un-
derstanding the wonderful Con-
trivance and Texture of so admi-
rable a Machine, as is that of the 
Humane Body, is no ordinary part 
of Science, and what undoubted-
ly the Person who Administers 
Physick ought to be acquainted 
withal. From which notwith-
standing, I cannot see how the 
Apothecary is totally excluded, since 
there are constant Anatomical Dis-
sections at the Surgeon's Hall, which 
is open to Apothecarys as well as 
|P_8
Physicians; and where I presume 
there is more to be seen in one 
Year, than the Young Physician
meets withal in six at his Acade-
my.

The pretended Advantages they 
have over us in Chymistry, are of 
a-piece with those before men-
tion'd: For not to Instance our 
own private Elaboratorys, the pub-
lickElaboratory at the Hall, where 
all Chymical Preparations are 
made in the highest Perfection, is 
a sufficient Confutation of that 
groundless Assertion. 

These, Sir, Being the principal 
Reasons on which You build 
your Hypothesis, namely, the Ad-
vantages which the Physician has 
over the Apothecary, I shall not 
content my self with this general 
Reflection on them, but shall pro-
ceed to examine them more closely, 
|P_9
and particularly that of Study-
ing at the University, by which is 
meant a liberal Education, as if 
the Streams of Polite Literature 
and Knowledge were not alike 
diffus'd throughout the Globe, but 
were scantily confin'd to the Banks 
of Cham or Isis.

We will suppose then, An Apo-
thecary, who is Master of the 
Latin and Greek Tongues, (as 
there are few of them but are) to 
be as duly Qualified for the Read-
ing, Comparing and Animadver-
ting on Physical Authours, as the 
Academic Physician, which I think 
no sober Intelligent Person will 
deny, if he allows that the Greek
and Latin Tongues as Taught at 
Westminster, Pauls, &c. to be as fit 
for that purpose, as what the 
Young Physician generally carries 
with him to Oxford, &c. 

|P_10
Neither will it be disputed with 
me, I think, that Reading, Reffe-
ction, Observation and Experi-
ment, are the only known means 
of acquiring Humane Learning 
and Science: To all which, the A-
pothecary thus Qualified, has as fair 
pretences as the most Elevated 
Physician of 'em all; and where-
in the Apothecary may as reasona-
bly be thought to make as great a 
Proficience, provided he uses the 
same Industry and Application. 

It may be objected, That altho' 
the Apothecary be thus Qualified, 
yet whilst he is an Apprentice he 
has little or no time for these Stu-
dys, if he had never so great an 
Inclination; that what with the 
Duty to his Master, and the com-
mon Necessities and Expence of 
Life, which ask some time to be 
repair'd in spight of us, there will 
|P_11
be little or none left for any thing else. 

To this I Answer, That altho' 
for the first Year or two there may 
be little else done, yet by that time 
he begins to have a true Tast of 
the Matter, and his Reason shines 
forth with brighter Rays: If he 
be a Youth of any Spirit and E-
mulation, he will and do's find a 
thousand opportunities of advan-
cing his Knowledge, equal, if not 
superiour to the Academic Physi-
cian.

The Apothecary then thus Qua-
lified, may very reasonably be 
thought to understand the Study 
of Physick, the Natures of Dis-
eases and their Cures, equally with 
the Physician, tho' he cannot boast 
the High Advantages of a liberal 
Education and AccademicAccom-
plishments. 

|P_12
Whilst the Physician contends 
with us after this manner, we shall 
never recede from these Principles: 
But if he shall say, That the Advan-
tages of an Academic Education 
are a better Foundation for him to 
Set up for a Wit, a Poet, or En-
tertaining Company; then indeed w
e submit, frankly acknowledg-
ing that we industriously shun 
those Arts, which rather tend to 
the Subversion and Destruction of 
the Animal Life, than its Preser-
vation and Emolument. 

If then the equal Learning of 
the Apothecary sets him upon a le-
vel with the Physician,notwith-
standing his boasted Advantages 
over him, it can never be imagin'd 
that the Composition and Admi-
nistration of Medicines by which 
he discovers their Nature and O-
perations, will be any hindrance 
|P_13
to him in the persecution of those 
Studies which naturally lead him 
to any inquiry into the Structure 
and Oeconomy of the Humane-
dy, and the manner how these Me-
dicines he prepares Operate upon it. 

This certainly without Vanity 
we may affirm, That we under-
stand the Materia Medica as well, 
not to say better than most Dispen-
saryPhysicians.

The World is very sensible what 
Advantages they owe to these Mo-
dern Reformers of Physick; to 
whose wonderful penetration we 
have not yet heard that Physick 
has been Obliged for one Addition 
or Discovery: But that is not their 
business, 'tis sufficient for them if 
they can libel the Town in their 
awkard Exclamations against the 
Apothecarys, by which they vainly 
imagin'd to have Ingross'd the 
|P_14
whole Art of Compounding and 
Vending Medicines to the Publick. 
But alas! fond deluded Men, This 
knowing Age was not to be led 
Hoodwink'd to their Ruin. The 
Town saw through the thin Dis-
guise, and laugh at the senseless 
Contrivance: They knew the A-
bilitys of those Persons who un-
dertook the Project, and that most 
of 'em so far from being able to 
Compound Medicines as they 
ought to be, scarce knew the Di-
stinction between Mint and Cardus.
It may be thought perhaps, that 
here I have a little Transgress'd, 
and gone beyond the limits of 
Truth, for that so small a degree 
of Knowledge is sufficient for that 
purpose, that it is next to impossi-
ble that even a Dispensary Physi-
cian should be without it. What-
ever may be thought of it, I have 
|P_15
undeniable Proofs of this Asserti-
on to produce, when ever pro-
vok'd to it. 

'Tis certain, That however An-
gry the Dispensary Physicians may 
be with us at present, they had 
once a better Opinion of our A-
bilitys and Understanding; I 
mean, when they Compos'd that 
most Elaborate Piece, the London 
Dispensatory; where 'tis evident they 
did not understand what they 
were about, by the unaccountable 
Jumble of Alteratives and Ca-
thartics in the same Composition: 
Nay, nor even the making the 
Composition it self; else, What is 
the meaning that we so often meet 
with Ut Artis Est, Secundum Artum,
and the like? By which at least 
they tacitely confess that we are 
the more knowing of the Two. 

|P_16
Since so much has been said of 
the Dispensary Physicians, it may 
not be unseasonable to speak a 
Word of their Mighty Captain,
and to desire the Impartial Reader 
to Examine that Famous Book, 
which has made so much Noise in 
the World; wherein the Igno-
rance of its Writer is so very 
Conspicuous, that we need hardly 
point at his Mistakes. 

His Catalogue of Drugs and 
Simples, (notwithstanding the 
whole Conspiracy labour'd for its 
Birth) is a handsom Specimen of 
his Knowledge in the Materia Me-
dica; wherein there is scarce a 
Paragraph which has not some one 
or more rang'd in their improper 
Classes. 

The Senseless Remarks he has 
made on some of the best of Me-
dicines, show rather the Fertility 
|P_17
of his Spleen, than his Understan-
ding: The which nevertheless he 
fancies unanswerable, by his ha-
ving taken so much pains to bring 
Quotations from some Authours 
as Obscure and Splenatick as him-
self for his Vouchers. 

His Spleen and Ignorance will 
be the more remarkable, when 
we reflect on that Part of his Book, 
where with his wonted Assu-
rance he tells his Readers, That 
when it shall please the Almighty 
Dispenser of all things, to afflict 
them with any Malady, that they 
need not be very sollicitous con-
cerning the means of their Cure, 
that they have nothing to fear but 
the Lethiferous Apothecary; That 
if it should so happen that no Dis-
pensaryPhysician be at hand, 'tis 
much safer to trust to the uncer-
tain Event of the Disease, and the 
|P_18
Direction of Nature, or to any 
thing else, tho' it were but an Old 
Woman and Water-Gruel, than 
this Bugbear Apothecary. This is 
fine Jargon, and without doubt 
will be very grateful to a Person 
tortur'd with a Fit of the Stone,
or indeed in any other violent Pa-
roxysm or Convulsion of Na-
ture. 

It is confess'd, that Nature is 
most wise in all her Productions; 
and that if we will closely attend 
to her, she will never fail to Indi-
cate to us the true way by which 
she would be assisted by us in her 
Labours. But this I take to be be-
yond the Power and Address of an 
Old Woman, or even of our Dis-
pensaryPhysician himself. 

To say but one Word more of 
the Ingenuity of this mighty Au-
thour; and that is, that all the Bustle 
|P_19
he has made in this Matter, arose 
from a private Quarrel between 
him and an Apothecary, who it 
seems was a Man of too much Ho-
nour, and of too tenacious a 
Temper for the Friendship of this 
worthy Physician. When these 
things I say shall be duly consider'd, 
I make no question but the World 
will have just such an opinion of 
him and his Performance as they 
both deserve. 

Since then the Apothecary is not 
obliged to the Receipts of the 
Physician for his Knowledge in the 
Administration of Medicines in the 
Cure of Diseases, as the Vulgar 
falsly imagine, but goes to the 
same Fountain and Drinks as large 
and as pure Draughts of Know-
ledge as himself: And since most 
of us are ready to confess, that 
their Receipts have been so far 
|P_20
from being a Direction to us, that 
they have rather prov'd Ignes Fatui
to mislead us into those Errours 
we have been guilty of, in relation 
to Practice. 

Since the Present Learning and 
Labours of the Apothecaries are 
so abundantly evident in this 
Town, that it would be perfectly 
needless for me to mention them. 

And since we do, and can give 
Reasons equally with the Physici-
an, of the different Operations of 
Medicines us'd in the Cure of Di-
seases; Why are we thus Branded 
with the Opprobrious Names of 
Quacks, Mountebanks, Empiricks,
and what not, by the Mouth of 
the Conspiracy, that Mighty 
Champion for the Cause, The 
Renowned Dr. Pitt. O Doctiorum 
puicquid est Assurgite huic tam colen-
do Nomini.

|P_21
'Tis possible, It may be thought 
by what I have said, that I inten-
ded to bring an Odium on the 
Manner of Education, as now 
Practic'd at the Universities, and 
on those Learned Gentlemen who 
have been Educated there. I shall 
only beg leave to assure those Ho-
nourable Foundations, for whom 
I have the Profoundest Veneration, 
That I Contend for nothing but 
the bare Priviledge which our 
School-Learning Intitles us to, 
namely, the Understanding Greek
and Latin Authours, as well as the 
Physicians, tho' we have not had 
the Pleasure of being brought up 
under their Benign Tuition. 

And as for those truly Learned 
and Worthy Physicians, who have 
not departed from their Integrity, 
We are so far from the thoughts of 
Interposing in their Practice, 
|P_22
That We are, and always shall be 
ready, as it is our Duty, to Re-
commend and Introduce them, 
when ever it is in our Power. 

Thus, Sir, Have I Answer'd 
Your Request; and I hope have 
made it appear as much as the 
Brevity of this Letter will per-
mit, that those High Advantages 
you seem so fond of, are not so Un-
answerable as You imagin'd; and 
that in reality, They are no more 
than Vain, Empty, Airy Notions, 
the Genuine Production of the 
Imagination of a Dispensary Phy-
sician.

As this is barely a Specimen of 
what I have to bring against You, 
when Leisure and Opportunity 
offer themselves, I would desire 
You, as a Friend, in the mean time, 
to provide your self with a 
better Shield, to Ward off the 
|P_23
Blows of Your Adversary, than 
your Boasted Advantages are like 
to prove: And withal, that You 
will Publish Your Next, that the 
World may judge fairly the 
Merits of the Cause, and give 
the Crown to the Conquerour. 

FINIS.
