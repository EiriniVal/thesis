[}AN
ESSAY
Concerning the
Growth of Empiricism, 
Or the
Encouragement of Quacks. }]
HEALTH being the great- 
est of Natural Blessings, 
'tis as needless to say any 
thing in its Praise as to enlarge up- 
on the Usefulness of Physick, which 
preserves and restores it. But as 
there is nothing which would more 
|P_2
advance the Usefulness of that Di- 
vine Art, (and is therefore of great- 
er Importance to the Publick Good) 
than a Regulation in the Practice 
of it; so there is nothing conse- 
quently more recommendable to 
the Consideration of the Queen and 
Parliament than the present State 
of Physick in this Kingdom. The 
Encouragement which Quacks and 
Empiricks have lately met with, is 
not only so surprizingly great, but so 
vastly detrimental, that in the best 
of Governments, where Civil and 
Religious Properties are so hap- 
pily secured, there seems nothing 
more wanting than some speedy 
and powerful Expedient to restrain 
so growing an Evil. 

But before I proceed to offer any 
of my Reasons for the Necessity of 
a Regulation in the Practice of Phy- 
sick, or enter into a Detail of the 
evil Consequences (deservedly to 
|P_3
be lamented by all who have just 
Sense of them) which attend the 
Encouragement of Quacks and Em- 
piricks, 'twill not be improper to 
give the Definition of, or to let the 
Reader know what I desire may be 
understood by the Words. The Word 
Quack, says the Gazophylacium An- 
glicanum, is of a Dutch Original, 
signifies a frivolous and vain Tat- 
ler, and so is applicable to all Per- 
sons of any Profession, who osten- 
tatiously pretend to a great deal of 
Skill and Knowledge in Matters 
which they are really ignorant of, 
or do very little understand: And 
by a Quack or Empirick, I mean 
any and every one of those who 
pretend to practise Physick without 
Knowledge of the Prærequisita to 
that most useful but most difficult 
Art. There are some, 'tis true, 
who would fain perswade us, that 
the Medical Art is only to be pro- 
|P_4
moted by Experiments, or obser- 
ving what things are hurtful, what 
beneficial in Diseases; that the 
Study of Nature and the Know- 
ledge of the Body are only trifling 
Curiosities, and things altogether 
superfluous. But it's agreed, I am 
apt to think, amongst the more in- 
telligent part of Mankind, that 
there are several things perfectly 
and absolutely necessary to be 
known, before a Man can reason, 
and make Judgment either of the 
Nature of Diseases, or the Use of 
Methods and Medicines for the re- 
medying them, and therefore ought 
to be understood before he presumes 
to take the Care of Mens Lives in- 
to his hand: For how can he pre- 
tend to cure Diseases, unless he first 
apprehends what they are, and in 
what they consist? How can he 
rationally prescribe Medicines if he 
understands not their Operations? 
|P_5
Or how can he expect any manner 
of Advantage from them if he does 
not consider the Relation between 
the Disease and the Operation? 
And how can he be qualified to do 
any of these things, unless he be 
first acquainted with the Nature, 
Properties and Functions, of a hu- 
man Body, the Subject of his Art, 
and to which they relate? And 
that this was the Opinion of the 
ancient Physicians, is evident from 
the Variety of Medical Introducti- 
ons and Institutions publish'd by 
them. For it was not in those 
days thought proper that the Care 
of Mens Lives should be entrusted 
with Persons, till they were in- 
structed in the Methods of preser- 
ving them.

|P_6
But that there are several things 
absolutely necessary to be known 
by Men before they ought to pre- 
tend to the Practise of Physick, and 
which are what I mean by the Præ- 
requisita to the Medical Art, will 
more fully appear by a particular 
Enumeration of them, viz. the 
Knowledge of 
I. The learned Languages. 
II. Natural Philosophy. 
III. The Animal Oeconomy. 
IV. Pharmacology. 
V. Nosology. 

I. The first of the Prærequisita
then, which I shall mention, is the 
Knowledge of the learned Langua- 
ges: For Physick being the Wis- 
dom which is heap'd up in the va- 
rious Labours and Observations of 
the Learned of all Ages, or the 
Judgments of many Men wound up, 
|P_7
as it were into one [/1./], 'twill be 
found necessary in a Physician to be 
vers'd in the Writings of the An- 
cients as well as the Moderns, and 
to be well acquainted with their 
Rules, Cautions and Remedies, they 
having laid the first Foundation of 
the most excellent Art, by both 
observing and describing the Na- 
ture of Diseases. Most of the Di- 
agnostick and Prognostick Signs of 
Diseases are the Result of their la- 
borious and solid Observations, and 
will continue to be faithful Guides 
to all that can make Use of them, 
as long as human Bodies and Na- 
ture it self remain. Nothing there- 
fore can be more previously ne- 
|P_8
cessary to the Practice of Physick 
than an Acquisition of the Greek
and Latin Tongues; for as in those 
Languages the Art is deliver'd; 
so without them the Terms in the 
English Translations are not possibly 
to be understood. 

II. The next of the Prærequisita
is Natural Philosophy: For as the 
Art of Physick is only the Natural 
Knowledge apply'd to the Preser- 
vation of Health and Life; so 
whoever intend to apply themselves 
to that Art will find it necessary to 
consider the Human Body, the Sub- 
ject of their Art, as a meer Natu- 
ral Substance, before they proceed 
to the Consideration of it as an A- 
nimated Being. For tho' the Hu- 
man Body, as an Animated Be- 
ing, is, strictly speaking, the im- 
mediate Subject of their Care; 
yet the peculiar Properties of A- 
|P_9
nimated Substances cannot well 
be distinguish'd or understood, un- 
less the common Affections of Mat- 
ter be first known, out of which, 
the Human as well as other Ani- 
mated Bodies are compos'd. And 
notwithstanding those Particles of 
Matter, which are modify'd into a 
Human Body, during that State, 
are enrich'd with Properties and 
Perfections, distinguishing them 
from all other Beings, yet there re- 
main in them some Affections com- 
mon to other animated Beings, and 
some promiscuously to be found in 
all Natural Substances. Whoever, 
therefore designs to apply himself to 
the Art of Physick, ought to com- 
prehend the general Properties and 
Affections of Matter; the Origin 
and transitory Nature of Forms and 
Qualities; and how the Parts of a 
Human Body consider'd as a Na- 
tural Substance may be mov'd, be- 
|P_10
fore he begins to inform himself 
(or indeed rightly can) of the Af- 
fections observable in a human Bo- 
dy, as animated or endued with 
Life. And this seems to have been 
the Method by which Novices were 
heretofore initiated into that Art, 
as appears by the Institutes of Ga- 
len, Rhases, Sennertus, Fuchsius, 
&c. as likewise in that they have 
blended and interwoven the Philo- 
sophy esteem'd in those Ages with 
that most excellent Art, and have 
form'd that proverbial Saying, 

Ubi desinit Physicus, ibi incipit Me- 
dicus. 

But Natural Philosophy is not on- 
ly absolutely necessary to form a 
right Apprehension of the Human 
Body as a Part or Portion of Mat- 
ter, but also to frame a true Idea 
of Medicines and their Operations, 
|P_11
as will more fully appear under that 
Head. 

III. The next of the Prærequisi- 
ta is the Knowledge of the Animal 
Oeconomy, or the Consideration of 
the human Body as animated or 
endued with Life, and that as well 
in its natural or healthful, as in its 
præternatural or morbid State; it 
being altogether necessary to un- 
derstand the natural State of the 
Body before the Nature of a Dis- 
ease can be rightly comprehended. 
The Animal Body is now known 
to be a pure Machine, and its A- 
ctions and Motions demonstrated to 
be the necessary Consequences of its 
Structure. And as the Actions of 
the Body, from which Life and 
Health do flow, are the necessary 
Consequences of its Oeconomy; so 
likewise Diseases and all their 
Symptoms, are nothing but Alte- 
|P_12
rations or Disorders in it. It de- 
monstratively therefore follows, 
that the greater the Knowledge of 
the one is, the better the Nature 
of the other must be known; and 
that a Physician ignorant of the A- 
nimal Oeconomy is ignorant of the 
Structure and Uses of the Machine 
he undertakes to regulate. The 
Parts of Animated Bodies are aptly 
and usefully divided into Solid and 
Fluid. Anatomy, or the Art of 
Dissecting the solid Parts of Ani- 
mal Bodies, in order to an exact 
Discovery of their Situation, Stru- 
cture, Uses, &c. as it is absolutely 
necessary to the Knowledge of the 
Animal Oeconomy, so it has ever 
been justly esteem'd one of the 
Foundation Pillars of Physick. Nor 
indeed of less Use is the Doctrine 
of the Fluids; under which Head 
I include a right Apprehension of 
the general and particular Proper- 
|P_13
ties of the Animal Fluids, and of 
their different Motions, Natures, 
Uses, Offices, &c. There are se- 
veral other things also included in 
the Knowledge of the Animal Oe- 
conomy (and some few of them I 
shall just mention) which tho' not 
strictly referable to either Branch of 
the above-mention'd Division of 
the Parts, are yet equally necessa- 
ry to be understood; viz. the dif- 
ferent Dependencies the Parts have 
on, and the different Relations they 
bear to each other; the Powers of 
Motion (both Voluntary and In- 
voluntary) and Sensation; the ge- 
neral Reason and Nature of Secre- 
tion; the Velocity of the Blood's 
Circulation, with the Reason of its 
Differences at different Distances 
from the Heart; the Necessity of 
Breathing after Birth, with the 
Force of the Air upon the Blood in 
that Action, &c. &c. &c. But an 
|P_14
exact Knowledge of the Animal 
Structure and Oeconomy, will after- 
wards appear more particularly ne- 
cessary, as well to explicate the Vir- 
tues and Operation of Medicines, 
as to ascertain the Diagnosis, and 
comprehend the Ætiology of Dis- 
eases. 

IV. Another of the Prærequisita
is Pharmacology; comprehending 
the Knowledge, 1. Of simple Na- 
tural Medicines, whether of the 
Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral 
Kingdom. 2. Of the several Parts 
of Pharmacy, both Galenical and 
Chymical. 3. Of the general Na- 
ture, Virtues, and Operation of 
Medicines. For as a Man cannot 
be said to understand an Art, with- 
out understanding the Instruments 
as well as the Subject of that Art; 
so the Human Body being the Sub- 
ject, and Medicines the Instru- 
|P_15
ments of this Art, the Knowledge 
of the one must consequently be as 
necessary as the Knowledge of the 
other. 

I. By the Knowledge of simple 
Natural Medicines, I here mean 
that of the Substances themselves 
as well as of their Medicinal Vir- 
tues and Efficacies. 'Twould be 
altogether needless to wast any 
Time in insisting upon the Necessi- 
ty of understanding this part of 
Pharmacology: For as without 
knowing the Substances, a Man in 
his Practice must wholly confide in, 
or rely upon the Gatherers and 
Venders of Medicines; so indeed 
the Knowledge of their Virtues and 
Efficacies, without knowing the 
Substances themselves, seems to me, 
if of any, of a very dangerous Use. 

2. Pharmacy contains the Man- 
ner of Preparing and the Method of 
making such simple Substances into 
|P_16
Medicines, and consists of several 
Parts, whether according to the Ga- 
lenical or Chymical Forms. All the 
several Parts of Pharmacy, and of 
Chymistry in particular, viz. as it 
teaches the most Compendious and 
Efficacious Preparation of Medi- 
cines, are, and have been so often 
demonstrated to be so absolutely 
necessary to be understood by all 
who design for the Practice of Phy- 
sick, that as there is nothing in 
which Men seem more agreed than 
in the Necessity of understanding 
these things; so it would be but 
Loss of Time to enlarge any further 
upon them. I shall therefore con- 
clude what I have to offer under this 
Head, with the following Obser- 
vation; That since it is so necessa- 
rily incumbent upon every one 
who pretends to the Practice of Phy- 
sick, to understand all the Parts of 
Pharmacy, there can be no Obje- 
|P_17
ction made upon that Account, I 
mean, against a Physician's prepa- 
ring his own Medicines, but either 
by ignorant or interested Men. 
But tho' this Observation is suffici- 
ent to excuse the Physicians for gi- 
ving their own Medicines (which 
indeed is only resuming what their 
Ancestors either out of Pride or La- 
ziness left off) yet it does not fol- 
low that there is any manner of A- 
pology to be made for the Apothe- 
caries intruding themselves into the 
Practice of Physick, as will more 
fully afterwards appear. 

3. Under the third Branch of 
Pharmacology is compriz'd the 
Knowledge of the general Nature, 
Virtues and Operation of Medi- 
cines. And as Natural Philosophy 
was proved to be necessary towards 
forming a right Notion of the Hu- 
man Body, so 'twill be found as 
necessary towards comprehending 
|P_18
the general Nature, Virtues, and O- 
perations of Medicines. For Medi- 
cines being only natural Substan- 
ces, only Parts or Portions of Mat- 
ter, 'tis evident, that their Powers 
and Properties are not only under 
the same common Laws and Rules 
which are observed in the other 
Parts of Matter, but are also to be 
explain'd in the same Methods; and 
therefore Medicines are not only 
Natural Substances, but they also 
operate in a Natural Way, [i. e. by 
different Kinds and Degrees of Mo- 
tion] such Natural Substances loo- 
sing only their Denomination, and 
not their Natures, by being term'd 
or applied as Medicines. By a 
due Apprehension of these things, 
and without which it is impossi- 
ble for a Practitioner in Physick to 
be really useful or serviceable in his 
Generation, Men will know what 
Effects to expect, and be prevent- 
|P_19
ed from a credulous Expectation of 
Effects, which can in no wise pro- 
ceed from them in a natural Way. 
Medicines, notwithstanding the 
Materia Medica is made up of so 
vast a Variety of Natural Substan- 
ces, may, in respect of their gene- 
ral Virtues or Operation, be com- 
priz'd under such as produce some 
Evacuation, or such as only effect 
some Alteration in the Body. And 
not only Natural Philosophy, but a 
due Knowledge also of the Animal 
Oeconomy is absolutely necessary 
towards framing a right Notion of 
these Things: For unless Men un- 
derstand the Structure, and com- 
prehend the Uses and Offices of the 
Parts of the Body, it is impossible 
for them to know how, or by what 
Organs, or in what Regions, Parts 
or Juices, Medicines perform their 
Operations. 

|P_20
V. The fifth and last of the Præ- 
requisita, which I shall mention, is 
Nosology; containing whatever re- 
lates to the General Nature, Signs, 
Causes, &c. of Diseases. For as 
the Consideration of the Human 
Body, in its natural or healthful 
State, is, by Physicians, only in 
order to the Consideration of it in 
its Præternatural or Morbid one; 
so consequently there can be no- 
thing more previously necessary to 
the Practice of Physick than what- 
ever relates to the Knowledge of 
the General Nature, Signs, Cau- 
ses, &c. of Diseases. 

1. And first the Want of a clear 
Idea of the General Nature of Dis- 
eases must be a certain Means of 
laying a necessary and afterwards 
unalterable Foundation of Error 
and Miscarriage in Practice. One 
would be tempted to think, from 
|P_21
the erroneous Proceedings of unin- 
telligent Practitioners, that Diseases 
were really separate Essences, (or 
I know not what substantial Forms) 
and as such enter'd and possess'd 
the Bodies of Men. Whereas, by 
a due Consideration of their Na- 
tures, they will be found to be no- 
thing different or distinct from the 
Body, but only Changes or Altera- 
tions in the Modification of its con- 
stituent Parts, or different Modes of 
Indisposition in the same Body. 

2. Secondly, the Doctrine of the 
Signs, both Diagnostick and Prog- 
nostick, is not less necessary to be 
throughly understood, before a 
Man undertakes the Practice of 
Physick, than the General Nature 
of Diseases. For as by a due Know- 
ledge of the Diagnostick Signs, he 
may be instructed truly to distin- 
guish one Disease, tho' never so 
much alike, from another; so 
|P_22
thro' want of that Knowledge, one 
Disease is very often mistaken for 
and treated as another. How of- 
ten, for Instance, has a Colica and a 
Nephritis, a Fluor Albus and a Go- 
norrhæa, a Chlorosis and a Phthisis
been confounded? So that the 
Foundation of Cure seems prima- 
rily to be laid in a right Apprehen- 
sion of the Diagnostick Signs of each 
Distemper. But here it ought to 
be observed, that the better a Man 
understands the Animal Structure 
and Oeconomy, the more capable 
he will be both of comprehending 
and ascertaining the Diagnosis, and 
that a Man ignorant of those things 
must necessarily mislead himself by 
the Use of a common Name, and 
apply it to denote Circumstances 
which are so far from being always 
alike, that they will be sometimes 
found extremely different. 

|P_23
And as to the Prognostick Signs 
of Diseases; tho' it be certain that 
the Recovery of the Sick is the 
great Design of the Medical Art, 
and undoubtedly more necessary 
than Presaging the Event of Di- 
stempers, yet the Advances which 
have been made in the Prognostick 
Part of Medicine, as acquiring no 
small Esteem and Authority to the 
Physician, ought diligently to be 
collected from the Observations of 
the Ancients, particularly of the 
Divine Hippocrates, as well as from 
the Writings of the Moderns. 

3. Thirdly, the Ætiology of 
Diseases; I mean more particular- 
ly as to the immediate and conjunct 
Causes, will be found as necessary 
to be known be every Practitioner, 
as either the General Nature of 
Diseases, or the Doctrine of the 
Signs. For if, as is very evident 
in Practice, Diseases even of the 
|P_24
same Denomination, arising from 
different Causes, do administer 
different Indications, or indicate 
different Methods of Cure; the 
Ætiology must consequently be a 
grand Source from whence Ratio- 
nal Indications can be drawn. 
'Twere very easie to give Instances 
in almost all the Diseases incident 
to the Human Body, but thinking 
it altogether needless, because the 
Medical Writings are so full of them, 
I shall conclude this Head with ob- 
serving, That as an exact Know- 
ledge of the Animal Structure and 
Oeconomy is absolutely necessary 
to comprehend the Ætiology of 
Diseases; so the Modern Improve- 
ments in Anatomy have very consi- 
derably advanc'd the Ætiological 
Part of Medicine. 

Having thus, with the utmost 
Brevity demonstrated, that there 
|P_25
are several things perfectly and 
absolutely necessary to be known 
by Men before they ought to 
pretend to the Practice of Phy- 
sick; my present Design does 
not at all oblige me to enquire 
whether I have enumerated all the 
Prærequisita to the Medical Art; 
but from that Enumeration of them 
which I have made, and from 
what I have advanc'd, under each 
of those Heads, may very fairly 
venture to draw the following Con- 
clusions, viz.
I. That Experience alone will 
not make a Physician. 
II. That the Enumeration of 
the Prærequisita to the Medi- 
cal Art is a sufficient Argu- 
ment with what Difficulty a 
due Qualification for the 
Practice of it is attain'd. 
|P_26
III. That it is a plain Demon- 
stration, how unqualified the 
Quacks are for exercising the 
Profession they pretend to. 
IV. That it is an evident Indi- 
cation to the rational Part of 
Mankind, who do, and who 
do not, and that the far great- 
est Part of the Practitioners 
in Physick do come under 
the Denomination of Quacks. 
V. That an Apothecary can no 
more be said to be Qualified 
for the Practice of Physick, 
than any other Mechanical 
Tradesman. 

I. That Experience alone will 
not make a Physician: For if there 
are, as I have already proved, se- 
veral things absolutely necessary 
to be known by Men, before they 
can judge of the Nature of Disea- 
ses or Remedies, which are what I 
|P_27
mean by the Prærequisita to the 
Medical Art: It evidently follows 
that Experience alone, i. e. Expe- 
rience without the Prærequisita will 
not make a Physician. The Art of 
Physick then may very aptly and use- 
fully be said to consist of two Parts, 
viz. The Theoretical and Practical. 
And as there is nothing truer on the 
one hand, than that the Theory, viz.
the Knowledge of the Prærequisita
is, as has been fully prov'd, abso- 
lutely necessary to the Practice: 
so there is nothing more evident on 
the other, than that the Know- 
ledge of the Theory, tho' previ- 
ously necessary, is only in order 
to, and therefore useless without, 
the Practice. For tho' 'tis impossi- 
ble (I affirm) a Man should make 
any considerable Figure in the Pra- 
ctice, who is ignorant of the præli- 
minary Arts which compose the 
Theory of Physick: And if with- 
|P_28
out the Knowledge of those Arts, a 
Man jumps, as I may say, into 
Practice, such a one is never to be 
trusted, tho' he had seen Thousands 
of Patients, and ten thousand Pre- 
scriptions; yet do I not (as it is ri- 
diculous to) suppose, that Men 
should rest here, or dwell upon the 
Theory; or that the speculative 
Part of Physick should teach them 
to cure all manner of Distempers in 
their Closets, without a constant 
Attendance on the Sick, without a 
diligent and unwearied Observa- 
tion on Diseases. A due Appre- 
hension of these things may be a 
Means to determine the many un- 
necessary Disputes concerning the 
Preference of one Part of Physick 
to the other; the Knowledge of 
the one absolutely depending on, 
and consequently being altogether 
as necessary as that of the other. 
And as Theory and Practice, so 
|P_29
Reason and Observation ought not 
to be compar'd with, or oppos'd 
to, each other, but join'd together, 
as mutually adorning and illustra- 
ting one another, to the fully com- 
pleating of a Physician. A Man 
may be an Advocate for Experience, 
and well appriz'd of the Usefulness 
of accurate Observations, and at 
the same time not discard the Use 
of Reason in Physick. True Ob- 
servations will never be found to 
contradict Right Reason, nor will 
Right Reason exert it self in oppo- 
sition to matter of Fact. But lest 
any of the Empirical Tribe should 
pretend to take Shelter under Au- 
thorities, or to interpret what Ba- 
glivi says concerning Experience and 
Observation in favour of themselves, 
I've purposely read over all the 
Works of that celebrated Author, 
and from innumerable Passages in 
his Writings, think nothing more 
|P_30
evident, than that it is a Literate, 
and not an Empirical Experience, 
which he contends for. 'Tis not 
Experience without the Prærequisi- 
ta, but such a well grounded Ex- 
perience as a Man duly qualify'd 
for the Practice of Physick, may 
daily with Reason, be suppos'd to 
acquire. And 'tis as evident, that 
what he has advanc'd, concerning 
the Importance of Observation in 
the Way of Physick, ought to be 
interpreted in that very Sense. For 
tho' he says, That nothing so na- 
turally tends to the Improvement 
of Physick, as Experiments and 
Observations, yet 'tis certainly true, 
that he desires it might be under- 
stood (as indeed it ought to be) of 
Experiments directed by the Know- 
ledge of the Animal Oeconomy, 
and of Observations grounded on 
that and the other Prærequisita. So 
notwithstanding what Dr. Syden- 
|P_31
ham declares, viz.[/2./]Artem Medi- 
cam haud rectius esse perdiscendam, 
quam ab ipsius Artis Exercitio atque 
Usu ; and [/3./]Praxin esse Medicinæ 
Profitentium Lapidem Lydium , 'tis 
evident from Passages enough in 
that worthy Author, particularly 
from the whole 81st Page of the 
last mention'd Treatise, that he 
never design'd, by what he 
says, to advance an Empirical Ex- 
perience, or to preclude the Ne- 
cessity of understanding the Præ- 
requisita. As there is nothing more 
ridiculous than to suppose all Men 
capable of making a good Use 
of Experience, or able to draw 
right Conclusions from the Motions 
of Nature; so Quacks and Empi- 
ricks, who set out without either 
|P_32
Light or Method must undoubt- 
edly prove stupid and erroneous 
Observators: It being indeed im- 
possible that Men ignorant of the 
Medical Prærequisita, should be 
capable of improving either them- 
selves or the Art by their Experi- 
ence and Observations. What there- 
fore is daily said in praise of Expe- 
rience (to which no one pays a 
greater Deference than my self) 
and in Recommendation of expe- 
rienc'd Physicians, ought to be un- 
derstood with such a Restriction as 
not to include the Practitioners, 
who never had Opportunities of 
Understanding the Prærequisita. 
How ridiculous then is the Folly 
of those People who magnifie an 
Empirical Experience, or cry up a 
Quack or whatsoever Figure or 
Fame, for a Man of Experience, 
which wanting a Foundation, can- 
not be of any real Use and Ser- 
|P_33
vice either to himself or others. 

II. That the Enumeration of 
the Prærequisita to the Medical Art, 
is a sufficient Argument with what 
Difficulty a due Qualification for 
the Practice of it is attain'd. For 
if it be so absolutely necessary, as 
has been already prov'd, to under- 
stand the Prærequisita to that Art, 
'tis very easie to infer, both what 
Length of Time and Labour of 
Thought the Acquisition of so 
much Knowledge will require. 'Tis 
not then a Raw and Superficial 
Knowledge of Receipts and Medi- 
cines of Diseases and their Cures, 
which will qualifie a Man for the 
Practice of Physick, but a gradual 
Advancement thro' all the above- 
mention'd Foundations of the Art. 
'Tis not to be suppos'd, that the 
Ars longissima should be so quickly 
acquir'd, or the most difficult of 
|P_34
Sciences so instantly attain'd. And 
this Truth is not only confim'd by 
Hippocrates, in his very first 
Aphorism [/4./], and in his Enume- 
ration of the Necessaries which 
he requires to constitute a Good 
Physician [/5./] ; but by the con- 
current Testimonies, both of the 
Ancients and Moderns. Yet 
notwithstanding what has been ad- 
vanced, concerning the Prærequisi- 
ta to the Medical Art, and the 
Difficulty of acquiring the Know- 
ledge of them; it is very surpri- 
zing to consider what a vast Num- 
ber of Persons there are, who would 
fain become Physicians without La- 
bour and Study, and be saluted 
Sons of Apollo, without any man- 
|P_35
ner of Right to the Title. But 
all and every one of those who are 
ignorant of the Preliminary Arts, 
which compose the Theory, are 
but Pretenders in Physick, do jump, 
as I said, into Practice, and are ne- 
ver to be trusted tho' they had seen 
thousands of Patients, and ten thou- 
sand Prescriptions. But I now pro- 
ceed, in the third Place, more par- 
ticularly to consider, 

III. That the Enumeration of 
the Prærequisita to the Medical 
Art, is a plain Demonstration how 
unqualified the Quacks are for ex- 
ercising the Profession they pretend 
to. And if, as has been prov'd, 
there are so many things absolute- 
ly necessary to be known, before a 
Man can either reason or judge of 
Diseases; it evidently follows, that 
a Quack, ignorant of those things, 
is absolutely unqualified for that 
|P_36
Profession. Were but the Matter 
indeed, as impartially consider'd 
as it ought to be, there seems no- 
thing more ridiculous than to 
pretend to the Practice of Phy- 
sick, without a previous Know- 
ledge of them; it being im- 
possible but such People must make 
either Improper, Dangerous and 
Destructive, or Insignificant and 
Useless Applications. It is not on- 
ly true in Fact, that the most ge- 
nerous often prove the most dead- 
ly Medicines, if administred with- 
out Judgment; but it is an every 
day's Observation, that those very 
things which have the Reputation 
of being harmless and inoffensive, 
if improperly applied, do too often 
create very great Mischiefs. In the 
Practice of Physick there is requir'd 
not only great Labour of Thought, 
in searching into the several Ap- 
pearances and Circumstances of 
|P_37
Diseases, but also great Strength of 
Judgment in duly weighing and 
comparing them together. And 
it is not here, as in many other 
Cases, where Experiments may be 
repeated without any great Injury; 
for this perhaps admits but of one 
single Tryal, which possibly may 
terminate in the Death of a Man, 
and one false Step, especially in an 
acute Disease, may be of the most 
fatal Consequence. Physick, 'tis 
true, abounds with a very large 
Number of excellent Medicines: 
But Medicines, being Relations to 
Human Bodies, can only be said 
to be good or bad, as applied; and 
like all other Instruments to do ei- 
ther Good or Hurt, according to 
the Nature of the Hand which u- 
ses them. As there is nothing 
more conspicuous on the one hand, 
than the useful Effects of Medi- 
cines, when Methodically and Ju- 
|P_38
diciously administred: So there is 
nothing more obvious on the other, 
than the deadly Effects even of 
those of the very first Rank, when 
us'd, without either Method or 
Judgment. Can any thing then 
more fully demonstrate the Vanity 
of Empiricism than the daily Ex- 
perience how Inefficacious and Use- 
less, even the most celebrated Spe- 
cificks are without a Judicious and 
Methodical Application? For tho' 
a more Noble Specifick than the 
Cortex, for Instance, was never 
known, yet Experience convinces 
us how frequently we are forced 
even in intermitting Fevers, to call 
in to our Assistance, the Know- 
ledge of Animal Oeconomy; 
and by Vomiting, Purging, or o- 
ther proper Means, to render that 
Specifick useful, which would o- 
therwise have been of no Effect: So 
that nothing seems more ridiculous 
|P_39
than for a Man to pretend to cure 
Diseases, tho' arm'd with the best 
of Medicines, without the Know- 
ledge of the Animal Oeconomy, 
and the Nosological Prærequisita. 
It may as well be expected that a 
blind Man should shoot flying, or 
a deaf one tune an Organ. 

I cannot therefore conclude this 
Head without observing (which 
indeed naturally flows from the 
foregoing Considerations) how un- 
accountably infatuated they are, 
who apply themselves to any of the 
Empirical Tribe; there being no- 
thing so monstrous as their Preten- 
ces; nothing, but the no less mon- 
strous Credulity of those who em- 
ploy them. But, 

Quos perdere vult Jupiter, prius 
dementat. 

Does any one Man more deserve 
|P_40
to be ridicul'd, than he, who thinks 
his Gold Watch of too great Value 
to be put into the Hands of an un- 
der Workman, and at the same 
time, trusts his Body, a Machine 
of infinitely more curious Structure, 
with an ignorant Pretender in Phy- 
sick. Can a Man put a greater 
Affront upon his Reason? Or can 
he give an odder Demonstration of 
his Kindness to Wife, Children or 
Friends, than to commit any of 
them to the Care of such unequal 
Managers? In Matters of far less 
Moment, Men generally are more 
guided by the Dictates of Reason, 
and not so easily impos'd upon by 
any kind of empty Pretensions. If 
the Title of an Estate, wherein 
they are concern'd, be never so lit- 
tle suspected, they immediately ap- 
ply to the Best Advice, and will 
spare neither Cost nor Pains for a 
Right Information; but which is 
|P_41
the most unaccountable Piece of 
Folly imaginable, are extremely 
less sollicitous about the Care of 
their Bodies than their Estates. 

IV. That the Enumeration of 
the Prærequisita to the Medical Art, 
is an evident Indication to the Ra- 
tional Part of Mankind, who do, 
and who do not, and that the far 
greatest Part of the Practitioners 
in Physick do come under the De- 
nomination of Quacks: I appeal 
to the Rational Part of Mankind, 
because they are the fittest Judges 
in the Matter; for as they are ca- 
pable of distinguishing who have, 
and who have not, had Opportuni- 
ties of understanding the Prærequi- 
sita; so they cannot but at the same 
time be convinc'd, that the far 
greatest Part of the Practitioners in 
Physick, come under the Deno- 
mination of Quacks. There is no- 
|P_42
thing more Evident than that there 
are Pretenders in Physick, who are 
so far from having any Knowledge 
of the learned Languages, that 
they cannot write their own; are 
so far from having made any Search- 
es into the vast Collection of An- 
cient Learning, that they never 
perus'd even the Observations of 
the Moderns; are so far from un- 
derstanding Natural Philosophy or 
the Animal Oeconomy, that they 
never had Opportunities of learn- 
ing Anatomy or Chymistry; ne- 
ver saw a Dissection, or one Pro- 
cess of the Preparation of Medi- 
cines. What a melancholy Re- 
flection then is it, that such a Trade 
of deceiving should be carried on 
under the Pretences to so useful an 
Art; and to consider, what a Num- 
ber of People there are who ha- 
ving no other Foundation but Im- 
pudence and Ignorance, bubble so 
|P_43
many Thousands out of their Mo- 
ney and Lives? 

V. That an Apothecary can no 
more be said to be Qualified for 
the Practice of Physick than any 
other Mechanical Tradesman. Tho' 
the Preparation of Medicines, ac- 
cording to the Prescript is properly 
speaking the Business of an Apothe- 
cary, and which Preparation re- 
quires only the Knowledge of the 
Substances themselves, and not of 
their Medicinal Virtues and Effi- 
cacies; yet let us suppose an Apo- 
thecary endued with that Know- 
ledge also, and let us consider how 
far it will qualify him for the Pra- 
ctice of Physick. We will then 
suppose him to know that this Me- 
dicine will purge; this, vomit; and 
this produce other Evacuations, or 
perhaps only Alterations in the Bo- 
dy. But as to know what is Indi- 
|P_44
cated is one thing, and how to an- 
swer such an Indication another; 
so the Knowledge of the Virtues 
and Efficacies of Medicines will 
not at all instruct or direct him in 
the Application of them. For Me- 
dicines being Relations to Human 
Bodies, can be only good or bad, 
as justly or unjustly applied: And 
therefore, as I instanc'd , tho' we 
suppose a Man to know that such 
a Medicine will undoubtedly Purge, 
i. e. sollicit the Bowels into that 
Motion we call so; yet whether 
this will be to the Advantage of the 
Person to whom it is given, de- 
pends not on the Man's Know- 
ledge of the Medicine's Operation, 
but on the Fitness and Disposition 
of the Patients Body to receive it. 
Again, a Man may know, that 
there are some Preparations of An- 
timony, &c. which will always pro- 
duce Vomiting. But tho' by the 
|P_45
Exhibition of a Vomit, a Vitiated 
Stomach is sometimes restor'd; yet 
when the Stomach is deprav'd from 
a Cause which cannot be removed 
by Vomiting, 'tis plain, that the 
Use of such Medicines cannot pos- 
sibly effect its Recovery. And a 
great many more Instances might 
be given in respect to the Opera- 
tion of Medicines, which only pro- 
duce some Alteration in the Body. 
The Excellency then of the Medi- 
cal Art consists in a right Appre- 
hension of the Relation between 
the Powers of the Medicine, and 
the Circumstances of the Disease. 
Now such a right Apprehension of 
this Relation, as is sufficient to 
qualify a Man for the Practice of 
Physick, cannot possibly be acquir'd 
by the Knowledge of Medicines, 
their Preparation and Virtues; but 
of all the abovemention'd Prære- 
quisita to the Art. And this single 
|P_46
Consideration of the Relation be- 
tween the Medicine and the Body, 
as it distinguishes a Regular from 
an Empirical Practice; so it suffi- 
ciently exposes the Vanity of con- 
fiding in Receipts or Nostrums, 
and plainly demonstrates that the 
most celebrated Preparations (even 
of the Philosophers by Fire) are 
not capable of curing Diseases, 
without a Judicious and Methodi- 
cal Application, and that there 
can be nothing consequently more 
ridiculous than to suppose an Apo- 
thecary capable of advising from 
seeing the Prescripts of Physici- 
ans. If then the Knowledge of 
the Preparation of Medicines, if 
the Knowledge of their Virtues, 
and Efficacies, nay, if seeing 
the very Prescripts of Physicians, 
will not amount to a Qualifica- 
tion; it demonstratively follows 
that an Apothecary can no more 
|P_47
be said to be Qualified for the Pra- 
ctice of Physick, having no other 
Means or Opportunities of acqui- 
ring the rest of the Prærequisita, than 
any other Mechanical Trades-man. 
That small Pittance of Learning 
which is acquir'd at School, if not 
afterwards lost in the servile Offi- 
ces of the Shop, can claim no man- 
ner of Consideration: No; the 
Prolix and Laborious Study of Phy- 
sick, ought assuredly to commence 
upon a more Literate Foundation; 
and the Knowledge of it is not pos- 
sibly attainable, but by an Educa- 
tion of a quite different Nature. 

'Twill be very pertinent to my 
present Design, and not unaccepta- 
ble to my Reader, I hope, to ac- 
quaint him, how the Apothecaries 
first crept into Houses, and intro- 
duc'd themselves into the Practice 
of Physick. Their officious Visits 
were at first made under Pretence 
|P_48
of carrying the Physick themselves, 
which indeed might procure them 
the Reputation of careful Men, 
tho' by running on the Errands 'tis 
plain they chang'd Offices, with 
their Servants, and left them at 
home to do the Duty of their Ma- 
sters. This gave them Opportu- 
nities of insinuating themselves in- 
to Nurses, Servants, and other 
weak Persons attending the Sick; 
and by their Means of being ad- 
mitted to give their Opinions; and 
thence under Pretence of good 
Husbandry for the Patient, to re- 
peat the Physician's Bills, without 
his Order; and at last to prescribe 
without his Advice. Yet I am 
not, I must confess, for wholly 
laying aside this Order of Men, 
they being, in my Opinion very 
useful and serviceable in their pro- 
per Station and Business, which is 
the Preparation of Medicines ac- 
|P_49
cording to the Prescript of the Phy- 
sician. But when an Apothecary 
deserts his Station in the Shop, 
neglects the Business of his Trade, 
and runs about advising in all Di- 
stempers; he becomes an Empi- 
rick, and invades a Profession which 
he cannot be suppos'd to under- 
stand. Can any thing be more a- 
stonishing than the levelling of a 
Learned Liberal Science, with a 
Mechanick Trade of the Hand di- 
rected by that Science? I could 
wish the Fool's Character had been 
preserved in our Chronicles, or 
that his Features were now to be 
seen in his Statue of Brass, who 
first sent for the Handy-craft La- 
bourer of the Medicines to answer 
any Questions concerning the Na- 
ture of the Distemper. 

There is certainly no more Re- 
lation between the Business of an 
Apothecary, and that of a Physi- 
|P_50
cian, than between the Grinding of 
Colours and the Art of Painting: 
And therefore an Apothecary, who, 
without Knowledge of the Prære- 
quisita, pretends to the Practice of 
Physick, is altogether as ridicu- 
lous as a Colour-grinder, who, 
without any Skill in Drawing, 
should presume to manage a Pen- 
cil. The one may hear the Pa- 
tients examin'd, make up the Me- 
dicines himself, and observe their 
Effects; the other may see the first 
Stroaks chalk'd out, prepare the 
Colours himself, and afterwards 
see his Master at Work; yet nei- 
ther of them, without being first 
instructed in the various Rules as 
well as first Rudiments of the re- 
spective Arts, shall enter into the 
Skill of either the Physician or 
Painter, tho' they look'd on them 
till Dooms-day. What Pity 'tis 
the Imitations of both cannot be e- 
|P_51
qually expos'd to view, that the 
unskilful Management of the one 
might be as conspicuous as would 
be the ridiculous dawbing of the 
other. 

There is also another Body of 
Men, I mean the Surgeons, who 
notoriously enough (tho' not in- 
deed so frequently in great Towns 
as the Apothecaries) invade the 
Profession of Physick. But as the 
Rules above-mention'd are suffi- 
cient to distinguish an Empirical Pre- 
tender from a Qualified Practitio- 
ner; so by the Application of those 
Rules to the Surgeons, 'tis very ea- 
sily demonstrable, that they cannot 
but come under the Denomination 
of Quacks in Physick. 

Tho' from what has been alrea- 
dy advanc'd, both concerning the 
Prærequisita and the Conclusions 
which have been drawn from the 
Enumeration of them, it may seem 
|P_52
altogether needless; yet I shall now 
proceed to offer three or four Rea- 
sons more, which will further de- 
monstrate the Necessity of a Re- 
gulation in Physick: And those 
may be said to regard, 
I. The Good of the Publick in 
General. 
II. The Universities in Parti- 
cular. 
III. The Art of Physick it self. 
IV. The Regular Professors of it. 

I. The first Reason then for the 
Necessity of such a Regulation 
(concerns the Good of the Publick 
and) is the Loss of her Majesties 
Subjects. And if I affirm that the 
Encouragement of Quacks tends as 
much to the dispeopling of the 
Kingdom as the Wars; The Com- 
putation must be allow'd to be mo- 
|P_53
dest, provided they kill as many 
in other Parts of the Kingdom as 
they do in those within the Sphere 
of my own Observation. But the 
Truth of this Assertion will more 
evidently appear to any one who 
does but fairly consider the Num- 
ber of Quacks with which every 
Corner of this Kingdom has the 
Misfortune to abound. For what 
but the most dismal Execution up- 
on the Lives, or the most dreadful 
Destruction of Mankind, can be ex- 
pected from such a Prodigious 
Number of Men, who under- 
standing not what they profess; 
may truly be said to be Qualified, 
as they are Licenc'd, to kill. And 
tho' the most horrid Slaughters are 
daily committed without any Fear 
of Punishment or Reproof; yet 'tis 
not a more melancholy Reflection 
to consider what a vast Number of 
Men fall by the Hands of these 
|P_53
Executioners, than that the Execu- 
tioners themselves should escape 
the Hands of Publick Justice. I 
am not able to express my Indig- 
nation against such presumptuous 
Homicides: They ought to be ex- 
tirpated, if not at once, yet by 
Degrees, as the Wolves out of the 
Kingdom. 

But to return; I hope to be ex- 
cus'd (for whosoever is well appriz'd 
of her Powers may be pardon'd) for 
asserting, That it is better trusting 
to Nature than to an ignorant Pre- 
tender in Physick. That Physicians 
are only Servants to Nature, and 
that she is Morborum Medicatrix, are 
Truths known to the Ancients, 
and confirm'd by the irrefragable 
Experience of the Moderns. And 
as Nature alone will conquer some 
Diseases, and judiciously assisted 
the greatest part; so nothing is a 
brighter Demonstration of the 
|P_55
Greatness of her Strength, than that 
even the Mismanagement of Nur- 
ses, Apothecaries and other Quacks, 
is not able to hinder the Recovery 
of very large Numbers, which fall 
under their Hands. The greatest 
part of the Symptoms of Diseases 
are the Efforts of Nature, but 
which Efforts being easily disturb'd, 
or soon oppos'd, require the most 
strict and wary Observance, and 
without Judgment, we may sooner 
injure than assist her; sooner op- 
press than relieve her. A Physici- 
an ought therefore religiously to 
observe and obey the Motions of 
Nature, to look upon them as his 
surest Guides in the Cure of any 
Distemper, and to be advis'd, ac- 
cording to them, what to do, and 
when, and in what manner to pro- 
ceed. The Art of Physick is not 
understood till the Artist compre- 
hends, in the Words of my Lord 
|P_56
Bacon, Quid Natura ferat, & faciat . 
But if the Calamities of the Sick 
are encreas'd by the very Means 
which are used for their Relief; if 
instead of carefully assisting Na- 
ture in her Progresses to the Pre- 
servation of Life, she be clogg'd 
with useless and insignificant, or 
oppress'd with dangerous and de- 
structive Applications: I may just- 
ly conclude the Condition of those 
People who have the Misfortune to 
fall under such Hands, to be indeed 
a very deplorable one; and the 
Loss of her Majesties Subjects, from 
the fatal Mismanagement of so vast 
a Number of Quacks, to be con- 
sequently so very great, that 
the Encouragement of them may 
truly be said to tend as much to the 
dispeopling of the Kingdom as the 
Wars. 

|P_57
II. Another Argument for the 
Necessity of a Regulation in Phy- 
sick, is, that the Encouragement 
of Empiricism has already been a 
very great, and will hereafter be a 
far greater Detriment to the Uni- 
versities: For it can never be sup- 
pos'd, that Men will be at the Ex- 
pence of sending their Sons to any 
of the Seminaries of Good Litera- 
ture and ingenuous Education, 
when the Honours and Employ- 
ments of a Faculty may be obtain'd 
without it, and there is so little 
Distinction made between a Regu- 
lar and an extempore Doctor. The 
Apothecaries, and other Quacks, 
now openly avow their Resolutions 
of seizing on the Practice of Phy- 
sick; and of excluding in time all 
the University Physicians. They 
give not only Examples, but also 
Assurances of Success to all the In- 
|P_58
truders into Divinity, and others, 
of the pretended Education in the 
Liberal Sciences. It would indeed 
be no great Matter of Wonder or 
Complaint, were Empiricks encou- 
raged only by the Ordinary Sort of 
People; or as the French call them, 
the Petits Gens; there being, as I 
have often observ'd, a Sort of Sym- 
pathy between Understandings. 
But 'tis very unaccountably surpri- 
zing, and a just Matter of Com- 
plaint, that any of the distinguish'd 
Part of Mankind should venture e- 
ven in dangerous Cases to employ 
such illiterate, and consequently 
ignorant Pretenders. And what 
still enhances my Amazement is, 
that any of those Gentlemen, and 
especially any of the Clergy, who 
have had the Happiness of an Uni- 
versity Education; should give any 
manner of Encouragement to this 
sort of People. They have all laid 
|P_59
themselves under the highest Ob- 
ligations of Preserving the Honour 
and Dignity of those Fountains of 
Learning. And the Physicians of 
the Soul in particular being obliged 
to visit their Parishioners in Sick- 
ness, ought not only to inform 
them that it is their Duty, but to 
press them also to apply to the 
Physicians of the Body, whom the 
Divine Laws [/6./] as well as our own 
have appointed; instead of either 
making use of Empiricks them- 
selves, or advising others to make 
use of them. I can never sufficient- 
ly deplore these Indignities offer'd 
to our Universities, nor ever e- 
nough blame and condemn the A- 
bettors and Promoters of them; 
but am not without Hopes that such 
growing Mischiefs as these are, 
|P_60
will sometime be thought worthy 
the Consideration of those in whom 
alone is lodg'd the Power of Re- 
dressing them. 

III. Another Argument for the 
Necessity of a Regulation in Phy- 
sick, regards the Art it self; the 
Encouragement of Quacks and Em- 
piricks threatning the Ruin of the 
Profession as well as of the People. 
'Twould be no very difficult Task to 
demonstrate the Certainty of the 
Medical Principles, and consequent- 
ly the real Usefulness of Physick to 
Mankind. But such an Attempt 
does not at all seem necessary in 
my present Design; because 'tis not 
to be suppos'd, that Persons should 
apply themselves even to the most 
ignorant Pretenders in Physick, un- 
less such Persons really thought they 
should receive some Benefit from 
the Directions of those to whom they 
|P_61
did apply. Yet notwithstanding 
Physick is undoubtedly establish'd 
upon such Principles as do wholly 
free it from those Reproaches of 
Uncertainty which it has often, 
tho' falsly, been charg'd with; it 
must, at the same time, be con- 
fess'd, that the Malignity of some 
Acute, and the Stubbornness of some 
Chronical Diseases, do often elude 
all the Assistances of Human Art: 
For the most judicious and the 
most experienc'd Physicians can 
have no Power, as the Wise Man 
expresses it, in the Day of Death. 
But this can be no manner of Ob- 
jection to the Certainty of the Me- 
dical Principles, because it may 
happen and not proceed from any 
Defect in the Rules of the Art it 
self. For from a due Considera- 
tion of the Materials which com- 
pose a human Body, the Elegancy 
of its Structure, and the continued 
|P_62
Flux of its Parts, 'tis very evident 
that it must necessarily be obnoxi- 
ous to Disorders, which are Disea- 
ses; and sooner or later as necessa- 
rily to a Dissolution, which is Death. 
So that whoever is well appriz'd of 
the wonderful Fabrick of the Hu- 
man Body, how curiously contriv'd 
and divinely fashion'd a Machine 
it is, may consequently be rather 
amaz'd at our living so long, than 
at our dying so soon. But tho' it 
must be acknowledg'd that it is not 
in the Physician's Power at all times, 
or in all Extremities, to retrieve or 
preserve his Patients from the Jaws 
of Death, (since to die is an Entail 
upon our Natures) yet it may with 
Modesty be affirm'd, Experience 
abundantly proving it, that there 
is so much Power in Medicines, 
and so much Virtue in Methods, as 
to enable him, if he but heedfully 
weighs and judiciously applies them, 
|P_63
to give Ease to such as are in Pain, 
Sleep to such as are wearied out 
with Watching, and Strength to 
withstand the Approaches of grim 
and dreaded Death. But a Phy- 
sician cannot, I say, be suppos'd 
capable of doing these things with- 
out a due Consideration of Circum- 
stances, and a Judicious Applica- 
tion of Medicines. For if Medi- 
cines are promiscuously us'd in all 
Constitutions, or without Regard 
to the Circumstances of each Case, 
'tis no Wonder they so often de- 
ceive Men in their Expectations of 
Success. And therefore as the 
Knowledge of the Prærequisita is 
the only Means of Qualifying a 
Man for a successful Practice in 
Physick, and consequently of ad- 
vancing the Credit and Reputation 
of the Art; so the Ignorance of 
Quacks, both of the Nature, Cau- 
ses, and Cure of Diseases, must 
|P_64
necessarily produce so many and 
so gross Mismanagements as can- 
not but extremely prejudice Man- 
kind in their Opinion of the Art. 
Their ill Successes are doubtless 
imputed to the Uncertainty of the 
Art it self, especially by the Un- 
distinguishing, which is much the 
larger Part of Mankind; and Men 
from their lessen'd Opinion of it, 
will by Degrees neglect to apply to 
any Advice at all; whereas the 
truly Noble and Divine Art it self 
ought by no Means to be charg'd 
with what is only to be imputed 
to the Ignorance of those who pre- 
tend to profess it. 

Besides, 'tis a true and general 
Observation, that Arts and Sciences 
do improve and grow useful, accor- 
ding to the Encouragement of those 
who profess them. But the fre- 
quent Application to Quacks and 
Empiricks, by Men of all Ranks 
|P_65
and Degrees, even to the most ex- 
alted Stations, is so publick and so 
vast a Discouragement to the Pro- 
fessors of Physick, that it may truly 
be said to threaten the very Ruin 
and Destruction of the Art it self. 
For as such a Discouragement must 
necessarily lessen the Number of 
the Professors in Physick; so it will 
consequently obstruct the glorious 
Progress of the Art, by hindring 
further Inventions, and future Im- 
provements in it. And how inca- 
pable the illiterate Pretenders in 
Physick are of improving either 
themselves or the Art, has been al- 
ready demonstrated. We may then 
very fairly suppose there will be but 
few Students in Physick, if after all 
the Labour and Pains of Acquiring 
that Knowledge, and after all the 
Expences of a Learned Education; 
their Bread shall be taken off their 
Trenchers, as we say, by every Il- 
|P_66
literate Pretender. What a most 
ingenious Author observes upon a- 
nother Occasion is very applicable 
to this. If we consider, says he, 
the Expensiveness of the Voyage, 
which is made in search of Know- 
ledge, 'tis very hard the Under- 
takers should be plunder'd of what 
they bring home by Privateers; 
under the very Canon which should 
protect them. All which Conside- 
rations are sufficient to shew, how 
far the Encouragement of Quacks 
and Empiricks obstructs the Pro- 
gress of that glorious Art which 
teaches the Recovery as well as the 
Preservation of Health; and con- 
sequently threatens the Ruin of the 
Profession as well as the People. 

IV. The fourth and last Argu- 
ment which I shall offer for the 
Necessity of a Regulation in the 
Practice of Physick, regards the 
|P_67
Physicians themselves, viz. That 
no Profession is so invaded with un- 
qualify'd Pretenders, as theirs. I 
do not doubt, but 'twill evidently 
appear, that such an Invasion is 
singular to the Profession of Phy- 
sick, notwithstanding what some 
have endeavour'd, tho' without a- 
ny Colour of Reason, to maintain. 
'Tis well known that Divinity and 
Law have their Palisadoes and In- 
trenchments; for who dare pretend 
in their Pulpits or Courts, but 
those who are fairly initiated ac- 
cording to Form and Custom? 
Whereas the Cobweb Fences of 
Physick are every Day invaded, 
any broken Weaver, Taylor, Shoe- 
maker, or merry Andrew, dub- 
bing himself a Doctor Extempore, 
and setting up for an Æsculapius. 
So that Quacking and Ale-keeping 
are now a days become the last 
Employments, to which Men of 
|P_68
decay'd Fortunes apply themselves 
to get Bread. And as none but 
those who are fairly Initiated or 
Admitted do presume upon the 
Professions either of Divinity or 
Law; so there is but one way of 
Initiating or Admitting Persons 
into the Exercise of them. Where- 
as on the other side, Men are ad- 
mitted to practise Physick by the 
most Unreasonable, and as they are 
at present manag'd, I may with Im- 
punity, I hope, venture to say, 
scandalous Methods; I mean by 
Licences out of the Ecclesiastical 
Courts. But that the Hardship of 
the Physicians Case may be set in 
the clearest Light, 'twill be neces- 
sary to enquire into the original 
End and Design, as well as pre- 
sent Management of such Ecclesia- 
stical Licences: I am well enough 
satisfy'd that their original End and 
Design was very good and laudable. 
|P_69
The Statute of Hen. 8. 3. [/7./] very 
pathetically expresses the Inconve- 
niencies ensuing by Ignorant Per- 
sons practising Physick, to the high 
Displeasure of God, great Infamy 
to the Faculty, and the grievous 
Hurt, Damage, and Destruction of 
his Majesties liege Subjects. For 
all which Reasons it enacts that the 
Bishop of each Diocese, or his Vi- 
car-General, be empower'd to ex- 
amine all those (except Graduates) 
who shall practice Physick in that 
Diocese. But the Wisdom of the same 
Statute is no less remarkable in obli- 
ging either of them to call to him 
such expert Persons in the said Fa- 
culty, as his Discretion shall think 
fit. For I hope, I may venture to 
declare my Opinion thus far, that 
I cannot but think the Gentlemen 
of those Courts very unfit Judges 
|P_70
of a Man's Capacity to practice 
Physick. And therefore in 14 and 
15 of Hen. 8. 5. it is still, I think, 
more prudentially enacted, That 
none shall practice in the Country, 
without a Testimonial of his Suffi- 
ciency from the President of the 
College of Physicians, and three of 
the Electors. I shall not here pretend 
to determine how far this posterior 
may be said to abrogate or null 
the prior Act. But the very End 
and Design of these Ecclesiastical 
Licences, viz. Prevention of the 
Inconveniences ensuing by Ignorant 
Persons practising Physick, is not 
only, as they are manag'd at pre- 
sent, wholly frustrated, but entire- 
ly perverted: For they are now a- 
days so far from preventing, that 
they are the only Means of bringing 
those Mischiefs and Inconvenien- 
cies upon us, which the Statute 
mentions, by admitting such Shoals 
|P_71
of unqualified Persons to practice 
Physick. That the Examination 
previous to Admission was former- 
ly strict and severe, is as cer- 
tain as that now a days Persons are 
admitted without any manner of 
Examination at all. Nay, so far 
is the Practice of these Courts cor- 
rupted, and the very End and De- 
sign of these Licences perverted, 
that they are now a days granted e- 
ven from a Testimonial of two Li- 
centiates. Can any thing then be 
more evidently apparent than the 
Necessity of regulating these Mat- 
ters? For tho' (as I before observ'd) 
the first End and Design of these 
Licences was undoubtedly Good 
and Laudable, and tho' they were 
not Injurious (and I am apt to think 
they were not originally design'd 
to be or indeed really were) to the 
Regular Physicians; yet if the Rea- 
son of a Law ceases, the Law 
|P_71
it self ought to be annull'd. But 
since the Method of Examina- 
tion is so very much alter'd; the 
Original End and Design of 
these Licences, so manifestly per- 
verted, and they themselves be- 
come so vastly Injurious both to 
the Faculty, and the Regular Pro- 
fessors of Physick; these very Con- 
siderations are so many Arguments 
a fortiori for the Necessity of a Re- 
gulation. And now I appeal to 
the sensible Part of Mankind, whe- 
ther any Profession be so invaded 
with unqualified Pretenders as 
Physick; and consequently whe- 
ther the Physicians have not the 
greatest Reason in the World to 
complain. And to whom should 
they complain, but to the Legisla- 
ture? For doubtless, it was one 
of the Ends of Parliamentary In- 
stitution to receive the Complaints, 
and redress the Grievances of the 
|P_73
Injur'd. Nay, do we not find the 
Legislature frequently interposing 
in other Professions to prevent or 
remove Grievances; but what Re- 
gard has there been to the most e- 
normous ones in Physick? Are 
not our Lives worthy the Care 
of the Laws, as well as our Souls 
or Estates? 

I shall now endeavour to obviate 
some Objections which are general- 
ly made, tho' indeed without any 
Shadow of Reason, against what I 
have advanc'd. And it has been 
objected in the first Place, that such 
a Regulation would be an Abridg- 
ment of the Natural Rights and 
Liberties of Mankind, to follow 
those Employments whereby they 
may get a Livelihood. I should 
be the most unwilling Man in the 
World to advance any thing which 
has the least Tendency to such an 
Abridgment. No, I have the ten- 
|P_74
derest Regard to their Civil as well 
as Religious Properties. But this 
Objection would equally hold a- 
gainst the Suppression of Gaming 
and other disorderly Houses, of the 
Royal Oak, and other such publick 
Nusances. For if the Good of the 
Publick ought not to be consider'd 
and prefer'd to that of private Per- 
sons, which I take to be an undenia- 
ble Maxim in all Governments; the 
Natural Liberties of Mankind may 
as properly be said to be abridg'd 
by such a Suppression, as by such 
a Regulation as I contend for. The 
same Answer will serve to some 
other Objections, which are much 
of the same Nature, and of no 
greater Force than the former, viz.
That the Legislature is under no 
manner of Obligation to concern it 
self in Mischiefs which Men vo- 
luntarily pull upon themselves; 
That all flourishing Governments 
|P_75
will encourage their People some 
Way or other to employ them- 
selves; That every Man is sui Ju- 
ris, and has a Natural Right of 
making Use of any Body he 
pleases, and if he be satisfy'd with 
the Risque he runs, what has any 
one to say in contradiction to his 
Humour. 

I now proceed to invalidate some 
Excuses which are frequently made 
in Extenuation of those Practices 
which I have been condemning. 
And a great many People I am apt 
to believe, will think to clear them- 
selves from the Imputation of En- 
couraging Quacks and Empiricks, 
by saying, That it is only in the 
Beginning of Diseases they apply 
to them; That in Cases of Dan- 
ger, they generally have Recourse 
to better Advice; and, That this 
Custom being so very common, 
does not seem to need any manner 
|P_76
of Excuse: But upon a stricter En- 
quiry into this Matter, the Custom 
of first sending for an Apothecary 
or other Quack, will not, I am apt 
to think, appear the less ridicu- 
lous, for being so frequent. For, 
as the Beginning of a Distemper is 
a very seasonable Opportunity of 
Assisting Nature, towards the Re- 
covery of Health, so the Conduct 
of those People cannot be sufficient- 
ly condemn'd, who neglect to im- 
prove that Opportunity, by not 
then calling in a judicious Assistant. 
But far more egregious is the Fol- 
ly of those who then apply them- 
selves to any of the Empirical 
Tribe; it being impossible, as has 
been observ'd, but such Persons 
must make either insignificant and 
useless, or dangerous and destru- 
ctive Applications. And as the 
Consideration of neglecting the Im- 
provement of this Opportunity 
|P_77
sufficiently condemns the Applica- 
tion to those who are call'd safe 
Men; who, as they say themselves, 
will do no Hurt if they do no Good; 
so the presumptuous Tamperers, 
on the other Side, may not only ir- 
reperably injure the Patient, but so 
quite change the Face of a Distem- 
per, as to render it very difficult, if 
possible, for even a judicious Physi- 
cian, when call'd in, to discover 
its Nature. But when a Physici- 
an has the Care of a Disease from 
the Beginning, he is able to make 
right Observations of the Progress 
and Alteration of its Symptoms; 
and consequently, not only to form 
a surer Prognostication of its Event, 
but more effectually to assist Nature 
in the Preservation of Life. 

Again, there are others who pre- 
tend to excuse themselves for not ap- 
plying to the best Advice upon the 
Account of saving Charges; tho' this 
|P_78
Consideration can be of no manner 
of Force, unless it can be thought an 
Excuse to have the Chance of be- 
ing kill'd cheap. But would those 
very People, who satisfy themselves 
with the Advice of an Empirical Pre- 
tender, but use their Arithmetick, 
they would soon be convinc'd, they 
acted as much against their Interest 
as Reason. For by physicking the 
Symptoms, and neglecting the 
Cause of a Disease, the Length of 
the Bill, as well as the Distemper, 
must be consequently encreas'd. 
'Tis not the collusive Pretence of 
giving Advice without a Fee, 
which can or ought to be esteem'd 
an Equivalent. 

There are some again who pre- 
tend to excuse themselves by plead- 
ing, that those to whom they ap- 
ply, are Masters of some magni- 
fied Receipt, or pretended infalli- 
ble Remedy for this or that Distem- 
per. 

|P_79
But the Vanity of confiding in 
such Trifles has been sufficiently ex- 
pos'd by the plainest Demonstration, 
That the most celebrated Prepara- 
tions even of the Philosophers by 
Fire are not capable of curing Dis- 
eases, without a Judicious and Me- 
thodical Application. I shall there- 
fore only subjoin another Confide- 
ration, which is an unanswerable 
Argument of their Insufficiency, 
viz. That none of these magnified 
Receipts or infallible Nostrums have 
ever stood the Test of an Age. 
Accordingly, our very own Experi- 
ence is so far from confirming, that it 
daily contradicts the Pretended Vir- 
tues which the Alchymical Writers, 
and the publick Venders of Quack 
Medicines, with a peremptory As- 
surance ascribe to them. 

'Tis urg'd again, that tho' it must 
be confess'd, that very easily cu- 
rable Diseases are often made fatal 
|P_80
by Quacks; yet 'tis equally true, 
that several Persons recover under 
their Hands. To this I answer, 
That they recover, 'tis true, when 
the Patients have more of their na- 
tural Vigour than the others are 
able to destroy, and rather to the 
Strength of Nature is the happy E- 
vent to be ascrib'd, than to the 
Judgment of the Medicinal Admi- 
nistrator; such Particular Cases 
being no more Arguments of their 
Skill than a blind Man's throwing 
Stones, and hitting some People in 
a Crowd is an Argument of the 
Goodness of his Aim. 

Having thus fairly and impar- 
tially represented the present State 
of Physick in this Kingdom, plainly 
indicated the Number of Quacks, 
with which it is so unhappy as to 
abound; and fully demonstrated 
not only the Impossibility of their 
being serviceable, but the absolute 
|P_81
Necessity of their being injurious 
to it, in the Exercise of the Pro- 
fession they pretend to: I think no- 
thing can be more consequentially 
evident than the Necessity of a Re- 
gulation in the Practice of Physick. 
And I am not without Hopes, that 
some of the above-mention'd Rea- 
sons, viz. The Good of her Ma- 
jesty's Subjects in General; The 
Honour and Advantages of Her 
Universities in particular; The 
Life and Reputation of so useful an 
Art as Physick; or the Particular 
Hardships, which the Gentlemen 
of that Faculty have the Misfor- 
tune to labour under; I am not 
without Hopes, I say, that some 
of these Reasons will so far influ- 
ence our Legislators, as to prevail 
with them to take the Representa- 
tion of this Case into their imme- 
diate Consideration: It is a Case 
undoubtedly, of the greatest Mo- 
|P_82
ment and Importance; for as the 
Life and Health of every individu- 
al Subject, so consequently all 
Ranks and Qualities, all Parties 
and Distinctions of Men are in the 
highest Degree, and equally con- 
cern'd in it. And as the great Im- 
portance of the Debate makes it not 
unworthy the Cognizance and En- 
quiry of our Legislators; so the ve- 
ry Nature of it seems more particu- 
larly to recommend it self to their 
Consideration. For 'tis certainly a 
great Shame, as well as an Unhap- 
piness, that in a Kingdom where so 
many good Laws are in Force, and 
in which as much Care is taken of the 
Liberties and Properties of the Sub- 
ject, as in any Nation upon Earth, 
the People should lie open and un- 
guarded in their dearest and most va- 
luable Enjoyments, Health and Life. 
There is nothing, therefore, which 
in my Opinion seems more plainly 
|P_83
to demonstrate a Deficiency in our 
Laws, than the Want of some to 
Regulate the gross Miscarriages and 
enormous Abuses in the Practice of 
Physick. The College of Physicians, 
'tis true, is vested with some Mea- 
sure of Authority; But as their Au- 
thority is confin'd to certain Limits; 
so, through Want of an Enlarge- 
ment of their Charter, it is not at 
present of that Use as seems corre- 
spondent to the Design of its Royal 
Institution: But either by enlarging 
the Charter to the College of Phy- 
sicians, or by such Ways and Means 
as the Wisdom of our Legislature 
shall better approve of; there seems 
nothing more feasible than to make 
a sufficient Provision against these 
pernicious and destructive Practices. 
And whenever it shall seem expedi- 
ent to those who sit at the Helm of 
our excellent Government, to un- 
dertake so useful and necessary a 
|P_84
Work; I humbly recommend, 

1. That the distinct Spheres of 
Physicians, Surgeons, and Apothe- 
caries, be limited and specified; 
The Surgeons restrain'd to their pro- 
per Business; the Apothecaries con- 
fin'd to their Shops; and all illite- 
rate and Empirical Pretenders in 
Physick suppress'd. 

2. That a Provision be made for 
the Poor to have their Share in the 
best Advice and Medicines. 

As the Want of such a Regulation 
in Physick is one of the greatest 
Flaws in our Constitution; and 
highly reflects upon the best of Go- 
vernments, so such a Regulation 
would undoubtedly tend as much to 
the Honour of our Nation, as the 
Preservation of its People; and 
which not only the present, but all 
succeeding Generations will have the 
greatest Reason in the World to ap- 
plaud.
