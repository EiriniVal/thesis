[}AN ACCOUNT
OF THE 
LONDON INFIRMARY. }]
[^Decorative frame around the letter "O".^]OF all Circumstances that affect the 
Mind of Man with Compassion, [/1./] no one seems to touch it so nearly 
as the seeing our Fellow-Creatures 
labouring with Diseases, and even 
perishing under them for want of proper and 
timely Assistance; for who that is not savage in 
Nature can pass regardless by those Numbers of 
miserable Objects, who daily present themselves 
to us, and whose various Diseases (were all 
other Motives silent) would be as so many Tongues, 
which at once speak their own Anguish and ex-
cite our Pity. As the Characteristick of the 
English is to be humane and beneficent, so no-
|P_2
thing shews it more than Institutions of a pub-
lick Nature, such as Hospitals and Infirmaries, 
which are here better regulated and supplied 
with Necessaries, than in any other Country what-
soever. Some there are of Royal Endowment, 
and establish'd Revenue, and others of more 
modern Institution, erected and supported by 
the generous and voluntary Contributions of 
good and well-disposed Persons; but all these 
are by Experience known to be no ways ade-
quate to the Numbers that seek Assistance from 
them; for as they can take in no more Patients 
than they have Beds, or give Medicine to more 
than what their Income will allow, many poor 
unhappy Creatures must be unavoidably lost. 
For 'tis a Truth well known, that tho' the City 
of London is more populous, and by its Trade 
and Navigation, the labouring Part thereof are 
more subject to Accidents and Diseases than the 
common People of Paris; yet it appears from 
the annual printed Accounts, that the Hotel Dieu
alone contains more Patients at one time than 
all our Hospitals and Infirmaries together. If 
such Provision is made for the diseased Inhabi-
tants of Paris, those of London more imme-
diately require our Regard; particularly, the 
British Manufacturers and Seamen, as they are 
|P_3
the chief Support of both our foreign and do-
mestick Trade. 

The Strength and Security of Great Britain
depending chiefly on its Naval Power, the Wis-
dom of the Legislature has shewed a peculiar 
Concern for the Comfort and Happiness of such 
infirm and disabled Seamen as have been en-
gaged in the Service of the Royal Navy: But 
for Seamen imployed only in the Service of the 
Merchant, and trading Part of the Kingdom, 
or the Wives and Families of such, in Distress 
by Sickness, no desirable Publick Provision has 
yet been made, or particularly instituted for 
their Relief. Nor are our numerous, poor, in-
dustrious Manufacturers, and Artificers, or their 
Wives and Children, by any particular Dona-
tions or Establishment, sufficiently provided for, 
under the Calamity of bodily Diseases and Ca-
sualties; tho' in such afflicting and melancholy 
Circumstances, they are incapable of providing 
for themselves or Families by their usual Labour 
and Industry. 

These Considerations have induced many be-
nevolent and publick spirited Noblemen, Gen-
tlemen, Merchants and others to turn their 
Thoughts upon raising by publick Subscription, 
a London-Infirmary, where British Sailors in 
|P_4
the Merchants Service, their Wives and Chil-
dren; and poor British Manufacturers, their Wives and Children; are daily admitted, and find Relief, in Distress by Sickness or Casualties: And this without any Difficulty or Expence of Admittance. 

In order to answer the Ends proposed, [/2./]a 
large House was taken in Prescot-Street, Good-
man's-Fields, which Situation was judged the 
most convenient, as being near the usual A-
bodes of Manufacturers and Seafaring Men in 
the Merchants Service, and at a considerable 
Distance from any Hospital. 

The House is spacious and convenient, [/3./]con-
tains about forty Beds, properly and airily dis-
posed, is furnished with Linnen, and all ne-
cessary Conveniencies. The Matron, a sober 
and discreet Woman, has the Charge of the 
House and Furniture; the Direction of the 
Nurses, and other Servants; and sees the Diet 
and Medicines administred according to Order. 
Under her, are Nurses, and Watchers, in pro-
portion to the Number of Patients, of experi-
enced Honesty and Tenderness, who are guided 
by written Orders to prevent Misconduct of 
any kind. Proper Diet for the Patients has 
been settled by the Gentlemen of the Faculty 
|P_5
engaged in this Charity, and is fixed up in the 
Wards for the Satisfaction of the Patients and 
their Friends. 

A Physician and Surgeon of Reputation are 
appointed, and attend daily, [/4./] from Eleven to 
One, without any Fee or Reward, and give 
their Advice to all such poor diseased Objects 
as think proper to come in those Hours, whe-
ther recommended or not; and other Physi-
cians and Surgeons of Character attend and ad-
vise in all dangerous or extraordinary Cases. 

The Dispensary is furnish'd with Drugs, [/5./] which being first viewed and reported Good by a 
Committee for that Purpose, are bought at the 
best hand, and compounded at the Infirmary,
where an Apothecary Resides, who constantly 
and solely attends the Business thereof. 

No Officers or Servants are permitted upon 
Pain of Expulsion to take of any Tradesmen, 
Patients, or other Persons, any Fee, Reward, 
or Gratification of any kind, directly or indi-
rectly, for any Service done, or to be done, on 
Account of this Infirmary. 

And as the Governors of this Charity are de-
sirous that the utmost Regard may be had to 
the Souls of the Patients, [/6./] as well as their Bo-
dies, a Clergyman of the Church of England
has generously undertaken, without any Gra-
|P_6
tuity, to read Prayers, and perform the other 
Duties of his Function, at the Infirmary.

Every Subscriber of five Guineas Yearly is a 
Governor of this Charity, [/7./] and is intitled to 
send in as many Patients as there are Vacancies 
of Beds; but if they can't be received as In-
Patients, they are relieved as Out-Patients. 
Every Gentleman giving a Benefaction of thirty 
Guineas at once, will be a Governor for Life.â€”
All Subscriptions are during Pleasure, and 
smaller Sums, from well-disposed Persons, will 
be thankfully receiv'd and acknowledg'd. 

Four Governors in Rotation every Month, [/8./] with 
any others that are pleased, attend Weekly, in order 
to receive, and dismiss Patients, supervise the 
Proceeding of the House, and do such Business 
as is usually done by Committees at other Hos-
pitals, and report the same at the next Quar-
terly or General Meeting. There is a General 
Meeting of the Governors every Quarter, before 
whom a Report is made from the Weekly 
Committees, all By-Laws are then Confirm'd, 
all Vacancies fill'd up, and Accounts Audited. 
Also an Annual General Meeting of all Sub-
scribers to Revise and Confirm the General 
Account of Proceedings, which will immedi-
ately after be publish'd for the Satisfaction of 
the Publick. 

|P_7
The Accounts are kept in a regular mercan-
tile Manner, and the Names of the Patients, 
their Employment, Place of Abode, Disorder, 
the Issue of the Case, and the Name of the 
Subscriber who sent them, are inserted in se-
veral Columns in a Book for that Purpose; and 
are always ready for the Inspection of Sub-
scribers, as also the Statutes and By-Laws for 
the particular Regulation of this Infirmary.

All poor, sick, and lame, [/9./] who are recom-
mended, or appear to the Committee to be 
truly necessitous, are received from the Hours 
of Eleven to One, who are supply'd with Ad-
vice, Medicine, Diet, Washing, Lodging, and 
every comfortable Assistance during their Cure. 
No Persons with incurable or infectious Dis-
tempers, or of known Ability to pay for their 
Cures, are admitted to partake of this Charity; 
but all Accidents are received at any Hour of 
the Day or Night. 

This is the Plan of our Proceedings, and tho' 
this Work is but in its Infancy, yet such has 
been the extraordinary Encouragement given 
to it, by Numbers of Distinguish'd Humanity, 
that we have the Satisfaction to assure the Pub-
lick, that since the 3d of November, 1740, it 
has pleased God to bless us with such Success, 
that upwards of 2000 distressed Objects have 
|P_8
been Relieved at the London Infirmary, and 
from Labouring under the Oppression of some 
of the most malignant Diseases, and unhappy 
Accidents, have been re-instated in their Ho-
nest and Industrious Capacities of Working; 
whereby the Publick again enjoy the Benefit of 
their Labour; They, and their poor Families 
preserved from Perishing, and prevented from 
being a constant Incumbrance to the Commu-
nity. 

The Subscribers are desired to take Notice, 
that if any Patients shall not conform to the 
Rules of the House, or are guilty of any Mis-
behaviour, they will be discharged for such Ir-
regularity, and never more relieved by this Cha-
rity. 

There was a Proposal in the Daily Adver-
tiser of the 17th of May, 1738, for erecting 
an Hospital, Infirmary, Surgery, Chappel, and 
School, for relieving of poor, aged, and other-
wise disabled Seamen in the Merchants Service, 
their Wives and Children, by a Subscription to 
be set on Foot amongst the Merchants, Owners, 
Masters, and Officers of Ships, and common 
Seamen, who were to pay certain Quarterly 
Sums according to their several Ranks, which, 
with the Contributions of worthy People, might 
have been sufficient for the desired End: As 
|P_9
the London Infirmary already begun, is calcu-
lated to relieve all those who are disabled by 
Sickness or Accidents, and their Wives and 
Children, and answers that Proposal in Part, 
and may be the Foundation of the Whole, we 
hope those who had so charitably join'd in sup-
porting that Subscription, will as readily interest 
themselves in this, which, if it pleases God to 
continue his Favour and prosper the Undertak-
ing, may in time, by such Encouragement, be 
extended to the whole Benefit proposed by that 
Advertisement. 

Such Persons therefore as are inclined to en-
courage and promote so laudable a Work, 
are desired to send their Subscriptions or 
Benefactions to Mr. Thomas Minors, Banker, 
in Lombard-street, who will give proper 
Receipts for the same: And any Person in-
clined by his last Will to bequeath a Legacy 
to this Charity, is desired to direct it to be 
paid to the Treasurer for the Time being, of 
the London Infirmary in Goodman's Fields,
and that his Receipt shall be a good Dis-
charge for the same.
