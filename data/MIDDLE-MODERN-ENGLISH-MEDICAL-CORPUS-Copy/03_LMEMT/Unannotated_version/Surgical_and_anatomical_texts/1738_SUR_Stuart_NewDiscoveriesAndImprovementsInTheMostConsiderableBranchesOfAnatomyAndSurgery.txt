SIR, 

[^Decorative frame around the letter "W".^]WHEN Interest does 
not Byass, Authors 
chuse for their Pa-
trons Persons honour-
ed with Affluence of Applause 
in their Professions. 

In your, early Years you 
discovered an inquisitive Spirit, 
|P_iv
and a pleasing Disparity in Un-
derstanding. 

This was the Motive on 
which Mr Barnard, Serjeant 
Surgeon of perpetual Memory, 
adopted you in Marriage to his 
Daughter his only Child. By 
inheriting his Fortune, and 
high Station with gene-
ral Approbation, you discover 
a Modesty, and Rectitude of 
Manners which can result only 
from Learning, and a superior 
Knowledge. 

As Head of the Faculty, and 
a Debt to your Merit, I ad-
dress this short Treatise to you. 

|P_v
You will perceive that it con-
tains many Discoveries in Ana-
tomy, and Surgery. Being wrote 
to a Pupil it wants an Expla-
nation in some Circumstances: 
This I will make to you on 
the first Intimation which I 
shall take as a Command, ra-
ther a Sanction; this I never 
will violate. 

Tho' your Approbation will 
be my Fame, and your Favour 
a great Purchase, I will sub-
scribe implicitly to your Sen-
timent. 

It is just that the Defects, 
and Blemishes should return 
upon me. 

|P_vi
As to my Education you 
will read where I had it. 

Undeserved Honour detracts 
from the Giver. 

Therefore we receive Plea-
sure in paying our Acknowledg-
ments to a Person transcending 
in Virtue. 

Honour, Ambition, Fortune, 
Happiness, and Inclination, the 
strongest Motives in Nature 
will always prompt me to court 
a Correspondence with you, 
if it be not a Crime. 

I am, Sir, 
Your Most Obedient, 
Humble Servant
Alexander Stuart.

SIR, 

[^Decorative frame around the letter "I".^]IN search of Things, laudable and praise-
worthy, Ambition is a 
Vertue. Prior to other 
Men, those of our 
Profession are required to pursue 
their Progressive Improvement in 
this Case; but we must climb the 
Hill; Vertue sits o' Top. Care is 
painful; the Charge of Men, and 
Women's Lives, and Limbs revolves 
|P_2
the Surgeon's Breast. To retain 
his Tranquility he is to proceed in 
his Business, according to the re-
ceived Maxims, and approved Me-
thod of the best Practitioners. 
Learning gives Tranquility of 
Mind; it points the Road to Re-
putation and Riches. 

It is a Maxim among Infidels 
to speak well of all Men as far as 
Vertue will permit; Slander is base, 
and does recriminate. It is far from 
me to derogate from the Masters 
of your Hospital,[/1./] but who among 
such Folks imparts his Knowledge, 
and if they do, ought not young 
Men to proceed in their Research: 
Reputation lost, is hardly retrieva-
ble; we are not to risk this rashly: 
On the other Hand, the World is 
apt to form a great Idea of a Sur-
geon of an enterprizing Genius; 
they presume that his Knowledge 
|P_3
is well founded; so they may, be-
ing attended with Success. Te-
merity puts a Man off his Guard; 
this is subject to great Danger. 

The Reduction of Fractures, and 
Dislocations is a great and necessary 
Article in a Surgeon's Business; to 
decline this, is inconsistent with his 
Character, see himself postponed to 
a country Fellow, in all other res-
pects inferior to him. Granting 
that many of those People set Bones 
at random, you will not easily be 
believed in saying so, even when 
they miscarry. There is Reason to 
retort, that good Surgeons fail in 
this Case, tho' Men are required 
to speak Truth, it would be a 
Hardship on Surgeons to tell all 
which they know, or believe: 
they would confess that sometimes 
the Swelling confounds them in 
distinguishing the Species of Frac-
|P_4
tures, particularly Luxations. This 
Reflection ought to put young Sur-
geons under an indispensible Ob-
ligation to distinguish the great 
Variety also of Sub Luxations, and 
be familiarly conversant with the 
oher Rules of Art, to arm against 
C####ngencies. When you have 
been instructed in the Osteology,
the Myology, and the Angiology,
the History of the Bones, the Mus-
cles, and the Blood-Vessels, you 
will cut without Danger, by the 
Disk and Re-place of the Head of the 
Bone, see how and where the 
Muscles and Ligaments are banded, 
and relaxed; then from the in-
tense Pain, the privation of Mo-
tion, and the Position, judge where 
the Distortion is made, notwith-
standing the Swelling. This Rule 
will direct you in adjusting the Ex-
tension, and in moderating the Vi-
olence. 

|P_5
When the Femur, the Thigh, 
is dislocated backward; I mean 
when the Head of the Bone is un-
der the Gluti, or Fleshchi, the 
three Extensor Muscles of the Fe-
mur, all Authors, as well as other 
Surgeons, agree, few contradict, that 
the Reduction is impractible, by 
Reason that the Head of the Bone 
cannot be removed; especially in that 
the Ligament, Tarsor, being broke, 
the Bone will not keep in it's Place: 
I will demonstrate how this Luxati-
on may be reduced, and by what 
Means the Ligament restored. 

Rules will be given respect-
ing Fractures, particularly the Ob-
lique, and Transverse-Fracture of 
the Femur, the Thigh bone, which 
cannot be felt, by Reason afore-
said. 

|P_6
Excellent Directions 
Will be given to keep the Com-
pound-Fracture free from Pain, 
and without the exfoliating the 
Bone, cure the Wound with Facili-
ty, and Promptitude. In depart-
ing from these Rules the menacing 
Accidents rising high, the Life of 
the Diseased is cast away, or hangs 
in doubt. 

You will be apprized of an Er-
ror in a reputed great Author:[/2./]
this for many Years has been a stum-
bling Block to his Practising-Suc-
cessors, and sometimes fatal to the 
Subject, if he escaped with his Life, 
he underwent a long Weakness, and 
not seldom a Deformity in his Limb. 
I am acquainted with a Gentleman, 
a shameful Example of this Error 
in two great Surgeons in Concert, 
one of them a Grandee of the first 
|P_7
Class; the Afflicted deplores the 
Remembrance of his Sorrow, and 
the Loss of the Use of his Elbow; 
these in a great Measure might have 
been prevented, with no danger of 
his Life, or Lameness, little Pain, 
loss of Time, or Expence compara-
tive. 

By the Indication of the Pulse, 
and of the Urine, you may betimes 
animate your Digestive, then by 
change of Dressing turn gradu-
ally the redundant Discharge to In-
carn the Wound, and generate, and 
confirm the Callous: This Practice 
must needs be just, seeing that by 
certain Tokens in the Matter or 
Discharge, this is known to be 
the Chyle, and indeed the native 
Balm of the Blood which cures all 
Wounds. In this Case, Old People 
seldom recover their Strength; the 
Spirit and Balsam of the Blood is 
|P_8
evaporated: This is become Cadave-
rous. 

If I do not take upon me to 
determine the controverted Hypo-
theses in Theory, it is not improba-
ble but in this I shall make a plea-
sing Advance. 

In this Sentiment you will find 
yourself in Condition to distin-
guish Books; was I to speak my 
Opinion of them, I must own that 
there are not many worth reading. 
It is not hard to comprize in a 
Sheet or two of Paper, what is ma-
terial in some of the best of them, 
particularly those of the Practice 
of Surgery. 

With a copious, and beauti-
ful Variety of Topics, you shall 
have the Occasional Method of In-
ternal Prescription, to digest 
|P_9
Wounds of the Brain, and Wounds
 of the Viscera. Of all other, Gunshot 
Wounds in the Joints are formidable 
to Nature. Application of actua-
ting, fortifying, and resolutive Me-
decines of various Kinds not ge-
nerally known are to be made ac-
cording to the Exigency of the 
Wound: the Surgeon is to steer his 
Course, as it were, between Cha-
rybdis and Scylla, a Rock, and a 
Sand, as they term it. Without 
adding Fewel to the burning Fe-
ver, he is to cherish the Genus Ner-
vosam; from thence the interes-
sing Soul sends continually Suc-
cours of Animal Spirits in Aid of 
Nature in the unequal War with 
her united cruel Enemies Pain, 
Fever, Thirst, Burning, Watching, 
Delirium. In Failure of these Spi-
rits to rarify, and animate the con-
densing Blood, to digest the Wound, 
alleviate the Pain, and support or 
|P_10
strengthen the Heart, labouring 
under the redoubling Pulse, the 
mortal Symptoms prevailing; the 
noble Organs ceasing to perform 
their Vital and Animal Functions, 
the Soul deprived of her Power, is 
forced to depart. 

You should learn to despamate, 
secern, and transfer the dangerous 
Rellux of purulent Matter oppres-
sing the Blood, and Animal Spirits 
with Restlessness, Fever, Delirium,
the Hickok, Lethargy, Apoplexy, 
Convulsions, &c. the Harbinger of 
Death. 

Upon a sudden Suppression of 
Sweat sometimes this becomes a 
Hetorene Humour, and with pun-
gent Pain vellicats the Intestines,
the Missentory, the Pleura, the 
Mediastinum, the Pericranium,
and other Parts greatly subject to 
|P_11
Resentment. Of all Cases this em-
barasses the Surgeon; Secretion be-
ing the Work of Nature he cannot 
appoint the Time, nor till this is 
accomplished hardly obtain a Res-
pite, or Cessation of the Violence: 
This seems to have been the late Case 
of a great King which for what we 
could perceive his Physicians and 
Surgeons knew, yet like a Starrost
with his Hand on his Sabre in Se-
nate, they were for defending their 
Argument in the Antichamber. 

Laudanum is our great Anodyne, 
this we are forbid; it restrains the 
Transfusion of the Animal Spirits 
on which depends the Function 
and Formality of the Parts, also 
the Energy of the secerning Blood. 
A continued Use of this Medicine 
may render the Disease incurable, 
or of a long Duration. Purging 
and Bleeding interrupt Nature: 
She has chose to deliver herself by 
|P_12
the denographical, or culicular 
Glands, and will not be controuled. 
Perspirating, Alexipharmic, and 
Volatile Medicines are of a little 
Effect till towards the Crisis;Na-
ture alone maintains the Conflict; 
Hence it happens that sometimes 
she does not overcome till from a 
Vernal Solstice chiefly, the Blood 
has received an Accession of Warmth 
to ferment, and discharge in the 
Surface. 

Some Years ago I tended a Gen-
tleman who upon drinking cold 
Water when hot, and Sweating 
was seized with a violent Pain in 
the nervous Tunicle of his Bowels. 
After a tedious Indisposition a 
large Abscess was formed in his 
Groin. Tho' I opened the Swelling 
as soon as it fluctuated: The Blood 
and Spirits were so tainted, and 
charged with this foreign Humour, 
|P_13
that he had an accelerated, a low, 
and an irregular Pulse; was delirious, 
had cold clam Sweatings, an Hic-
kok, a Diarrhea and a Gangarene 
round the Border of the Wound; 
also an advanced Mortification on 
the Inside of That Knee. In five or 
six Days the Wound discharged so 
many Quarts of a lixive, ganger 
Lymph: When the Mortification 
was stopt and a Separation made 
one might turn his Hand in the 
Wound quite to the Peritoneum in 
sight. Now the mortal Symptoms 
began to remit: In less than five 
Weeks the Wound was sicatrized. 
You will agree that the Cure depend-
ed on proper Internals; had there 
been a Defect in the Dressings he 
must have perished, so he would 
had I fatigued him with Pain. 

Between two and three 
Years ago, one Mrs Gyles, had for 
|P_14
Year before, a continual Diarrhea, 
or Lienterria; the Chyle, or Nou-
rishment, ran off, the greatest Part 
of it before it entered the Lacteals. 
In the Spring of the Year a large, 
cold, white, fluctuating Swelling 
grew on her right Hypondriabe-
low the Ribs. From the begin-
ning she had an aching Pain shoot-
ing deep into the Liver; the Seat 
or Source of her Indisposition; a 
suppressed Sweat transferred. A 
considerable Surgeon in Town told 
her to be well advised in whom 
she trusted, and that he did not o-
pen the Swelling too soon. In a-
bout a Week I stopt the Loosness: 
In eight, or nine Days more the 
Swelling became warm, and red-
dish, but frightfully increased in 
Bigness: I told her now was the 
Time; she yielding, I opened the 
Swelling with a Lancet; there was 
a Bason of a Quart and half a Pint of 
|P_15
formed Matter catcht; here and 
there streaked with Blood, toward 
the End. She, and others who 
saw the shifted Cloths and Bedding 
did believe that in 48 Hours the 
Wound did run a Gallon, and in 
four Nights two Quarts more; in 
all Six Quarts. The Return of the 
Diarrhea was what I apprehended 
most: This happened the first Night 
attended with cold, clam Sweating, 
a trembling Pulse, and Fainting; 
so again the second Night; and 
were as often taken off. In few 
Days more she mended daily, and 
in three Weeks was quite well: 
Then she grew Fat, Healthful, and 
Strong. She is lately married to 
James Taylor, a White-smith in 
Hatfield-street.

In five Weeks I cured a Gentle-
woman of a large Mortification in 
her Loins extending on the Os 
|P_16
Sacrum, and the Coxis, to affect the 
Sphinctures of the Anus, and the 
Bladder, cut off the Course of the 
Spirits, that she rendered her Ex-
crements involuntary. In the be-
ginning she had a Fever of the Spi-
rits, a Delirium, cold Sweatings, 
and a Syncopa. 

These Cures well understood, 
and the Medicines given will, with 
Variations, be a Precedent in many 
Grand Cases; nor are the Internal 
Things mentioned in any Book on 
such Occasions; yet which no Phy-
cisian, or Surgeon, speaking with-
out Prejudice, can disavow: They 
will, and must needs own that if 
any one ever was, these People, all 
of them by Medicine, were brought 
back from the Gates of the Grave. 

What deserves Remark; there 
was no Ruburb, or Astringent, no 
|P_17
Opiate, or Theriaca given in the 
Diarrhea, the Cortex suspends, or 
restrains Secretion; so does Lau-
danum: This shuts the Avenues 
of the Nerves, binding, or cente-
ring the Animal Spirits, it leavens 
the Blood, and opposes Digestion 
and Re-union. I shall occasionally 
speak farther of these Medicines, 
and how they may be given safely; 
here they would have been mortal 
by Reason of the Nervous Fever. 

In case of a Collection in the 
Mediastinum, De Verney says we 
may trepan the Sternum. He was 
Professor of Anatomy in the Roy-
al Garden at Paris, and probably 
the greatest that ever lived, taken 
throughout. He Illustrated his De-
monstrations of all Parts of the Body 
with his comparative Anatomy of 
Horses, Calves, Dogs, Cats, Fowl, 
Fish, Frogs, Eggs; including his 
|P_18
public Lectures, and Course of 
Operations. His Course of Anato-
my lasted from the Beginning of 
September till the end of March,
all the Week (Sundays, and Holidays 
excepted) from Morning till Night, 
an Hour at Noon allowed. He was 
Forty Years Royal-Professor; had 
read all valuable Books; was 
thought to be one of the greatest 
Orators in France. Being of easy 
Access his Scholars had a fair Op-
portunity of Improvement. His 
Papers would have made a Volume 
little less than a Church-Bible; but 
they never were published. Few 
can judge of the Loss, yet this may 
easily be perceived in the Defects, 
and Impertinencies in Mens Dis-
course and Writings on this Sub-
ject, some who hold their Heads 
high. 

|P_19
You shall see the several In-
tentions practised to restrain the 
Affluence of Suppuration, which 
procrastinates, and defeats the Cure 
of Wounds, and renders Ulcers 
sinous, callous, and fistulous, then 
by exalting, and displaying, reba-
ting, and correcting the Blood, ren-
der this subservant to your Purpose. 

You will be entertained with 
an Essay on the Hernia of the Parts, 
will learn to disengage the Intes-
tineIlion strangled in the tendous 
Perforation of the great Oblique, 
the external Muscle of the Abdo-
men; and how to prevent the Return 
of the Ilion into the Inguin, or 
Groin. Such is the Force of a few ex-
ternal Medicines, that they effect the 
Cure of the Rupture in People ad-
vanced in Years, if I do not say 
without help of a Truss, this I 
have done, upon considering 
|P_20
them well, and how they 
are adapted to several Pur-
poses co-operating, you will per-
ceive that they bear the greatest 
Congruity to Reason, and Proba-
bility of Success; should they fail, 
or fall short in what is promised, 
others are appointed to sustain the 
Effort, strike off the Symptoms as 
they arrive. In fine, you shall have 
a System of Prescriptions to tra-
verse the Train of Appearances, 
and anticipate the dangerous Ope-
ration of the Bubonocele or stran-
gled Rupture even when the ver-
micular, the peristaltic, or natu-
ral Motion of the Intestines is in-
verted, and they vomit their Ex-
crements as in the Micere, or Ili-
ac Passion. 

Ask at Mr Baker a Cooper in 
Nottingham-street: I cured his 
Wife of a strangling of the Bowels 
|P_21
attended with violent Pain 
and Sickness, when without Passage 
downwards, she for Eight Days vo-
mited every thing that she took. 

When on this Occasion, and 
probably in this Manner, you have 
had the good Fortune to redeem, 
or ransom Men from Death; you 
should fence them with Strength, 
brace the unbended Muscles, and 
the expanded Tendons, restore the 
Resort of the relaxed Ring, to with-
stand the Protrusion of the Intes-
tine, and of the Epiploon into the 
Ain, or Inguin, and the Scro-
tum, the Seat of the Bubonocele,
and of the Complete Hernia.

I have a Sheet of Paper wrote 
throughout on the Cause and Cure 
of the Rupture. 

|P_22
From the long and often-
times repeated Experience which I 
have had of my Method of Cure 
of the Rupture, I will, and do en-
gage to take only Twenty Shillings 
for Things, nor will I ask more 
if I do not cure the Diseased abso-
lutely, if through Neglect, or o-
therwise they do not profane the 
Use of my Medicines. I will, put 
them to no Pain, Trouble, or In-
conveniency farther than to wear 
a Cotton-Truss 10 or 12 Days till 
my Medicines do take Place. 

You will take Notice that this 
Promise is to be understood with 
some Exceptions, or Restrictions, 
respecting great Age and Weak-
ness. 

MrMitchell, Colourman over-
against Haberdashers Hospital in 
Hoxton; had his eldest Son born 
|P_23
with a Complete Rupture. I cured 
him at Ten Years old. 

A Scholar at the Latin Boarding 
School at Edmonton was lately cu-
red by me of a complete Rupture on 
both Sides the Intestine, or Bowel, 
quite down in the Scrotum.
Send to Mr Harrow Master of the 
Boarding School. 

You shall learn to supercede 
successfully the Stitch, or Suture 
of the Tendon, cure the Wound, 
and recover the Use of the Part soo-
ner, and with far less Pain, than 
by the Operation. 

The Cure of the painful An-
chylose, or White Swelling in the 
Joint, is a Consideration of no 
little Import, and known but to a 
few. You shall see how to give a 
present Judgment of this, and 
|P_24
cure all curable Kinds; this will 
go far. I have wrought Miracles 
of this sort, so may you with help 
of my Thesis on this Subject. 

I have an Essay on the Circulati-
on of the Blood in the Fœtus, and 
on the Nourishment of the Fœtus.

What is alluring to the Ear: 
You shall hear a Discourse on the 
Parts of Generation in Women, 
and on the Law of Formation, the 
Pre-existence of Lineaments in the 
Ovum.

I will annex an Essay on the 
Passions and Affections, accounting 
for them from the near, and fami-
liar Consent of the Various Plexus
of Nerves, and the intimate Cor-
respondence of the Animal Spirits 
reciprocating in them. 

|P_25
You shall be convinced of the 
Certainty of extracting the Stone 
in the Urethra, without Danger 
of having the Wound remain Fistu-
lous. 

To many opposite Digressions 
on the other great and necessary 
Heads of Anatomy and Surgery; 
I will give a Process on the Bron-
chocele, the glairous Swelling of 
the Glands Thyroides, threatning 
a Suffocation from the Pressure of 
the Swelling on the flexible Part of the 
Annular Cartilages of the 
Aspera Arteria.

About a Year ago, I opened 
an Ulcer in the Roof of Captain 
Hughes's Mouth: I exfoliated, 
and took out the Bone of the Pallat. 
Inquire at Mrs Starky's in Dean-
street, by Red-Lyon Square. The 
Captain will show the Bone, and 
|P_26
that the Wound stands sound, nor 
can you perceive any Alteration in 
his Speech. 

Three Years ago I opened 
and cured a Scrofolous, or King's 
Evil Swelling in a Gentlewoman's 
Neck. Inquire at Mr Kitchen's Ba-
ker in Buckle-street, by Red Lyon-
street, Goodman Fields.

An eminent Surgeon in Town 
will witness, that when with Three 
Bolusses of fourteen Grains of my 
Panacea I fluxed a Man Thirty 
Days; I opened the ulcerated Skin 
of his Nose. I cauterized the ca-
rious Bones several Times: I took 
out the Bridge, the Ossa Nasalia,
both of them, and without sinking 
the spungy Bone underneath to 
make a Blemish; I cured him also 
of an Ulcer in his Throat large e-
nough to receive a small Apple; 
|P_27
an Exostosis on his Wrist, and one 
on the second Joint of his great 
Toe; of all which he held well se-
veral Years, till he died of another 
Distemper.[/3./] Other Surgeons 
give 150 Grains of Mercurius 
Dulcis, or more; consequently my 
Method of cure of the Venerel Dis-
ease is much safer, nor is it less 
effectual, than a Flux raised by Unc-
tion, whereas their Method of Sali-
vation comes far short in Certainty. 

I saw a great Surgeon in Town 
give fourteen Grains of Mercurius 
Dulcis, and seven Grains of Tur-
bith Mineral, or yellow Mercury,
for one Dose in a Gonorrhæa, a run-
ning of the Reins as they call it. He 
told me that the Brotherhood speak 
as they please, but this is what 
they give, and even in greater 
|P_28
quantity, whereas I do not exceed 
ten Grains of my Panacea, and 
that castrated of its vitriolic cor-
rosive Points, in which is the Dan-
ger: It is by this Means that so 
small a Quantity of my Panacea
raises a Salivation. It is true that 
I mix another Powder; but you 
shall be satisfied that this has no Re-
lation to Mercury of any kind; 
nor is it Subject to ill Consequence. 

TurbithMineral causes 
worse Effects: Of this I give none; 
It weakens, and relaxes the Medul 
Spinalis, or Back Bone Marrow, 
the Root of the Nerves of the infe-
rior Parts that they cannot receive 
the Animal Spirits, nor indeed the 
Impression of the Imagination to 
push them. Thus defrauded of 
Spirits, the Stamen of Sense, and 
Motion, the Muscles of the Loins 
lose their Action and Strength, 
more or less. 

|P_29
Old Gleets proceed from 
what the French call a Debility, or 
Laxness of the Vessels, the Emun-
ctory of the Prostates. Purging 
makes the Case worse: Astringents 
are dangerous. I stop Gleetings 
of a long standing by tempering 
the Heat and Ferment of the Hu-
mour, by a Medicine absolutely 
safe, and pleasant to take. 

You will expect that I should 
give my Opinion of the Seat, or 
Source of the Gonorrhæa. We are 
commanded to strive for Truth; 
this obliges me to speak affirma-
tively in Contradiction to a Book 
on the Hypothesis of the Lacunæ,
and the Patrons of this Theory.[/4./]

Monsieur De Verney, the Gentle-
man already mentioned, shewed an 
Ulcer in the Prostates, of a Man 
who had this Distemper when he 
|P_30
died. I heard him also say, that 
from thence came the Matter or 
Discharge in this Case. 

TheProstates lie on the de-
pending part of the Bladder near the 
Sphincter, and the Erector Mus-
cles of the Penis. The Inflamati-
on, and Swelling of the Ulcer, is 
soon communicated to those Parts 
through the porous Tunicles of the 
Bladder, from this it is easy to 
account for the Heat, the Stoppage, 
and Strangury of the Urine, also for 
the Pain and Cordee in the Time of 
Erection. 

What I am going to say will 
cast the Ballance, and determine the 
Controversy on my Side, absolute-
ly. 

It is manifest that a Discharge 
of Matter must come from a Wound. 
|P_31
Consistent with this Demonstrative 
Proposition it is found that the 
Excoriation, or Ulcer of the Pros-
tates-Glands is always antecedent 
to the Gonorrhæa, whereas that of 
the Lucanæ does not happen of 
some time after, sooner, or later, 
according to the Heat, and Sharp-
ness of the Urine, and of the Run-
ning from the Prostates, so the 
Excoriation or Ulcer of the Lacunæ
can be only an Effect, or Conse-
quence of those Symptoms: I mean 
that the Heat, and Sharpness of 
the Urine, and of the vitiated Dis-
charge of the Ulcer in the Prostates
passing often through the Urethra
does chafe, and fret the thin and 
tender Membrane of the Lacunæ,
so occasions an Ulcer, or Excoriati-
on in this Part. 

In a long and great Discharge 
the Prostates are found to waste, 
|P_32
and in the End to shrink, and 
shrivel to almost nothing, while 
the Excoriation of the Lacunære-
mains without Alteration. These 
Reasons rise to a Demonstration 
of my Assertion. The Experiment 
may soon be made in the Hospi-
tals. 

The Succus or Juice of the 
Prostates, is the Vehicle which 
conveys the Volatile Semen into 
the Uterus. When this is spent, 
and the Prostates withered, Men 
become incapable of Procreation, 
but fertile Nature recovers some, 
as by a Miracle. 

As in the Prostates, a long, 
and great Discharge of Matter or 
Nutritious Juice from the Lacunæ
would run sinous the cavernous 
Body of the Penis, and give as 
little Trouble to cure it. 

|P_33
We should find it impractible 
to restore the Masculine Proportion 
of the Penis.

But these Accidents do not 
happen; therefore the Seat of the 
Gonorrhæa, is not in the Lacunæ.

I was bred in St Thomas's, Hos-
pital, under Mr William Coates-
worth: After this I was two Years 
under the celebrated De Verney at 
Paris, and in the Hospitals there. 

A great Man in Town was my 
Pupil: Now he is a Physician, he 
does not scruple to own that he 
formed himself chiefly on the Ana-
tomy, &c. which I taught him. 
His Father was a Surgeon of good 
Account; he chose me to educate 
his Son preferable to any Man in 
Town; so he used to say. I have 
bred several other Surgeons: Some 
|P_34
of them are much sought to in set-
ting Bones. 

DrJames Keill was a Gentle-
man no less valued for his Integri-
ty than his Knowledge in Anato-
my; I have inserted a Certificate 
from him. 

Take down in Writing three 
or four remarkable cases in Cure 
in your Hospital according to 
the Number and order of your 
Queries, I will Account for the 
Appearances from the Fabric, the 
Function, and Situation of the 
Parts. 

Have you a mind to hear 
something previous: Inquire out 
a Professor of Anatomy. I will 
meet him at his appointed Time, 
and Place, to answer and question 
him on this Subject. If he thinks 
fit the controverted Points shall be 
|P_35
submitted to the Wardens of Surge-
ons Hall, or to two other Professors, 
or Physicians, and a third to ad-
judge. 

SIR, 

The Swelling in your Lady's 
Throat is what Surgeons call the 
Bronchocele, or Hernia Gutterii;
but to speak in particular; I say 
it is a Distention of the Glands 
Thyroides. They are two in 
Number situated on the opposite 
Sides of the Larynx, and the supe-
rior Part of the Aspira Arteria
sinking to the flexible Part of the 
Anular Cartilages. The use of 
these Glands is to strain from the 
Blood, a vicous glairous Liquor, 
to lubrify the Cartilages of the 
Larynx to facilitate their Motion. 
They as well as other Glands are 
greatly subject to cold Defluxions. 
They are the principal Fountains, 
|P_36
and Recervatories of the Lympha.
Thus we may believe that this cold 
Humour is also sent thither from 
the salivary Sources, and other 
Glands adjacent. It is easy to 
think that as the Thyroides Glands 
swell, and take up a greater space, 
they press the flexible part of the 
Anular Cartilages aforesaid, oblig-
ing them to yield; they straiten 
the Trachia Arteria: This occasi-
ons the great Difficulty of Breath-
ing, and threatning of Suffoca-
tion. 

ON this principle we render 
Reason for the loss of her Voice: 
The Recrurent Nerves suffers a Com-
pression: Animal Spirits are want-
ing in the Muscles to play the Car-
tilages of the Larynx to form the 
Voice. She is worse when with 
Child, on Account that the Blood 
and Humours are more determined 
|P_37
to the superior Parts, especially in 
that as the Abdomen grows big it 
presses the Diaphragma against 
the Lungs, so lessens the Capacity 
of the Thorax, and hinders Respi-
ration. Parallel to this is the Case 
of Dropsical People alway opprest 
with shortness of Breath: I mean 
in the true Ascites when the low-
er Belly is filled with Water. 

The great Swelling gives Rea-
son to believe that the whole Sub-
stance of these Glands is sapped, 
and distended with this cold Hu-
mour like a spunge in Water; the 
sojourn of which has rendered their 
Texture so extremely lax, that they 
will not recover their Resort; con-
sequently not admit of cure. 
Hence it is hard to promise more 
than to prevent an Extremity; for 
which if Purging, Bleeding, espe-
sially Sweating, fortifying, dis-
|P_38
cussing, drying, and corrugating 
Spirits, with the Emplastrum, Di-
vinum, Diasulpharis de Ranis,
and Saponis spread and embrocat-
ed frequently with Os Succini redi-
ficati should not prove effectual 
one may venture to apply a Caustic 
on each Side the Aspira Arteria,
thereby procuring a plentiful Sup-
puration, the Humour may bedrain-
ed, and the Swelling sunk, but 
remembring that Digestion depends 
on the sweet Influence of the warm 
Blood, and Spirits in the Parts, of 
which in some Sort, this Swelling 
being deprived, it may be feared 
that the Wound will languish and 
ulcerate. 

|P_39
[}On the Circulation of the Blood 
in the Fœtus, and on the 
Nourishment of the Fœtus.}]
WAving the exploded Opi-
nion of the Antients con-
cerning the Manner of Nourish-
ment of the Fœtus;[/5./] without 
Doubt this depends principally on 
the Blood, or rather on the assimu-
lating Chyle. 

The Epigastric Artery of the 
Mother transfuses incessantly into 
the Placenta,[/6./] the Secundine, 
or Afterbirth a determined Quan-
tity of Blood. This is received 
by the Vena Umbilicalis, the Na-
vel String,[/7./] and carried in the 
|P_40
Porta through the Liver, thence 
in the Conduit Venœ, to the Ve-
na Cava, which empties in the 
Right Ventricle of the Heart of the 
Fœtus.[/8./] This Machine put into 
Contraction sends what Blood can 
pass through the Foramen Ovale,
and the remainder into the Arteria 
Pulmonaris: But Nature to favour 
the feeble Pulse of the Heart as 
wanting the Succour of Respira-
tion shortens also the Course of this 
remaining Blood. She pushes it 
through the famous Canal of Com-
munication, called also the Canal 
Botel, which joins the Artery and 
Vein of the Lungs. There is no 
more Blood sent into the Substance 
of the Lungs, than is necessary for 
their Nourishment. 

Without making the Circuit of 
the Lungs this second Portion of 
|P_41
Blood, is also sent into the left 
Ventricle of the Heart. This En-
gine armed with strong muscu-
lous Fibres throws the Blood 
through the Aorta, and it's Produc-
tions to all Parts of the Body. 

As the Blood returns to the Pla-
centa in the Umbilical-Artery, it is 
absorbed by the Epigastric Vein 
and brought back to the Heart of 
the Mother. In this Manner, the 
reciprocating Circulation is conti-
nually carried. It is by Means of 
the forementioned Canal of Com-
munication, that some Divers, hav-
ing it still open, can abide so long 
under Water. Such People cannot 
easily be hanged, the Blood, which 
upon straitening the Aspera 
Arteria, to hinder Respiration, 
would re-gorge and extravase in 
the Lungs retires to the Heart by 
this abandoned Passage, to keep up 
|P_42
a regular Sistole and Diastole, in 
alternate Contraction and Relaxa-
tion of the Ventricles of the Heart, 
by which the Blood, measured by 
the Auricles, is received and cast 
abroad to all Parts of the Body. On 
this depends the natural Life: In 
losing the Animal Spirits, and 
warmth of our Blood, we lose our 
Lives gradually. 

Death is an Univeasal Repose, or 
Cessation of Motion. 

[}The second way of Nourishment 
of the Fœtus.}]
We are not to omit that the In-
side of the Uterus, to which the 
Placenta adheres, is cloathed with 
abundance of Glands. They con-
tinually strain from the Blood a 
lacteous Liquor; this mixing again 
|P_43
with the Blood in the Secundine is 
sucked up, or pushed into the Um-
bilical-Vein, so goes to the Fœtus.

[}The third Source of Nourishment 
of the Fœtus.}]
The third Source of Nourishment 
of the Fœtus is remarkable, it is the 
great Quantity of Nutritious Juice in 
which the Fœtus floats in the Chorion
and Amnios, the Tunicles, or Mem-
branes, our cloathing in the Womb. 
This Juice has a milky chylous Taste; 
it passes or is drawn through the 
Nostrils down into the Stomach, and 
lessens in quantity as the Fœtus
grows in Bigness, so that at the 
Birth there is little or none left. 
As to the Objection that such a 
Liquor has been found in the Sto-
mach of Monsters who had no Nose 
or Mouth; perhaps this might be 
only the Salivo, or something less 
|P_44
considerable to sheath the Men-
strum of the Stomach, and the sup-
posedMeconio, the Mucus of the 
Rectum, where it is well known 
that the Fæces receive their Smell, 
their Colour, and Consistence; but 
I submit the Solution of these pre-
ternatural Cases to the Judgment 
of the College. 

TheRaynoides, or thirdMem-
brane, is not found in the Human 
Fœtus, for this does not urine[/9./]. 
The Glandula Renalis performs 
the Office of the Kidneys. As this 
has no Excretory, or Third Canal, 
doubtless the Serum, or Urine is 
brought back with the Blood in 
the Emulgent Vein. 

|P_45
[}An Essay on the Parts of Gene-
ration in Women, and on the 
Law of Formation, the Pre-
existence of the Lineaments in 
the Ovum.}]
THE Pre-existence of Linea-
ments in the Ovum, is the 
only Hypothesis on this Subject 
reducible to the mechanical, or geo-
metrical Principle, in which alone 
is Certainty. Tho' this is new, yet 
being highly curious and instruc-
tive, the greatest Physicians and 
Anatomists receive it readily. I 
shall with a parallel Example de-
scribe it in Terms so easy, and fa-
miliar, chast or seemly, that, with-
out Offence, this with a little At-
tention, or Instruction may in 
|P_46
general be understood by the fair 
Sex: They will see with Pleasure 
that this concerns them in a high 
Degree, Child-bearing Women par-
ticularly. 

Those of our Profession who 
know most; scruple not to con-
clude and report, that all the Ge-
nerations of Men were lodged in 
the Loins of Eve: The Name sig-
nifies Mother, and is meant the 
common Mother. 

God made of One Blood all 
Nations of Men. 

They compare the Ovarium
of a Woman to a Bunch of Grapes, 
Twelve, Sixteen, Twenty or More 
in Number. In each of these Ova,
or Eggs, the Lines or Lineaments 
of a Male, or Female, all of them, 
according to the great Fiat, are al-
|P_47
ready ready there. In their Turn as they 
become the nearest to what they 
call the Trump, the Head, or Ex-
tremity of the Tuba Falopiani, an 
Apendage of the Uterus, the Ma-
trix, or Womb, the Eggs become 
receptive of the Impression of the 
Semen of the Male in the amorous 
Congress. 

In the Height of the Caress, 
the transporting, the rapturous 
Influence of the Spirits, and of the 
ardent Semen, darting through the 
Tuba, dresses or distends the 
Trump. Now like a Hand this 
does embrace the Ovum, so that 
the volatile, the essential, or spi-
ritous Part of the Semen penetrates, 
warms, fecunds, enlivens, and de-
termines the Egg to receive pro-
gressive Nourishment from the cir-
|P_48
culating Blood of the destinated Mother. 

Thus the Conception claothed 
with it's proper Membranes; the Cho-
rion, and the Amnios, our Vesture in 
the Womb, and with the Placenta, or 
Secundine, all of them of the first 
Formation growing too big to hang 
upon the Ovarium, wanting also 
sufficient Nourishment does loosen, 
and separate. Now the impreg-
natedOvum is received by the 
Trump, and brought down through 
the Pipe, the second, or counter 
use of this Tube.[/10./]

The inner Orifice being shut, 
the Placenta cleaves to the Uterus,
and becomes a new and greater Source 
of Nourishment from the Blood of 
the Epigastric Artery of the Mo-
ther. 

|P_49
bilical-Vein, the Navel String, and 
goes to the Conception. Thus by 
the recurrent Vessels the Blood 
does alternate to the Mother. 

Now the Lines, or Lineaments 
of the Conception begin to unfold, 
and range by the increasing Blood 
pushing. 

In This manner the Concepti-
on becomes an Embryo, and this a 
Fœtus which by Degrees growing 
to Maturity, and straitened for want 
of Room, the Placenta also separat-
ing, falling away like ripe Fruit, or 
Leaves from a Tree, the Infant seeks 
to dislodge: Bearing on the Neck 
of the Womb, the Weight raises 
the Throws of Labour. 

To prove what they here ad-
vance, Anatomists husk or skin the 
Seed of a Pine-Tree Apple, then 
holding it before the Sun they 
show the Top, the Trunk, and the 
|P_50
Root of the Tree which it was to 
produce. 

This they take as a Demonstra-
tion of their Hypothesis of the 
Pre-existence of Lineaments in the 
Ovum, on the Plea, that the Law 
of Formation is general. 

Whiston believes that Generation 
is nothing but Nutrition, or Aug-
mentation of the Parts; so it is, 
the Ovum being impregnated as 
aforesaid becomes susceptible of 
Nutrition, and Growth. 

This Subject will be improved 
in Relation to the double Concep-
tion, and the parted Ovarium.

In the two foregoing Essays 
Women will see with singular Satis-
|P_51
faction the Time, and Manner of 
their Conception, and all the Al-
terations, and Accidents which do 
or may happen to them till their 
Delivery. Seeing that by Means of 
the Placenta the Child does only 
stick, or cling to the Womb, this 
may separate, or part by a Fall or 
other Violence. Perceiving the 
Danger, Ladies will naturally form 
to themselves a Regimen, or Man-
ner of Living to prevent Abortion, 
or Miscarriage. 

They will no longer believe the 
imposed Absurdity of bringing a 
Son, or a Daughter, at their Wish, 
or Desire. 

These things will be easily un-
derstood and give no little Plea-
sure in reading them. 

|P_52
[}OfBleeding. }]
FROM the Observation which I 
have made on many Peoples 
Arms, and the great Accidents 
which happen often, it is evident 
that the Danger in Bleeding is lit-
tle understood, few know how to 
shun it. You shall learn to Bleed 
easy, and be made absolutely safe

WAS the Use of the Curve-Ca-
theter generally known, and prac-
tised it would in a great Measure 
set aside the cruel Operation of Cut-
ting for the Stone. Having Re-
course to this Instrument, few 
would expose to so doubtful an 
Event. 

|P_53
The Reverend Mr John Rich-
ardson, Preceptor to Baptist Noel
Earl of Gainsborough, was for ma-
ny Years almost incessantly tor-
mented with a Suppression of 
Urine, and Strangury from a Stone 
in the Bladder. Sometimes he has 
staggered about the Room with con-
vulsive Pain. 

The first time that I introducted 
my Curve-Catheter he urined 
through this Instrument, and the 
Pain did remit. Next Day I turned 
a second Time the ragged Stone on 
the Smooth Part, and his Pain and 
Provocation went off. Excepting 
some short Fits of Pain, and Stran-
gury he urined regularly for 
three Months. In using may Cathe-
ter in this Manner three or four
Times a Year, he enjoyed a Life 
of Tranquility for Six Years till 
|P_54
he died, 1706. He was Fellow of 
Emanuel College in Cambridge, and 
his Vindication of the Canon of the 
New Testament, will perpetuate 
his Venerable Character in the 
learned World. 

How many are tormented 
with a Suppression of Urine, and 
Strangury from drinking Stale 
Beer, or prickt Wine, sometimes 
an Obstruction happens from an 
Excrescence in the Neck of the 
Bladder, or in the Urethra. In 
all which Cases the afflicted may 
expect. Relief from my Catheter.

I glide this Instrument under 
the Pubis into the Bladder, with 
either Hand from above-below, 
or below-above, without Pain, or 
Blood even in fencing with the 
Stone, if the Passage be not al-
ready excoriated. With this Instru-
|P_55
ment we push the Stone twice with 
the Curve, the Conoex and the 
Concave Part having as it were a 
greater hold, this gives a better 
Chance to turn the Stone than 
when they strike with the Point 
of the Strait-Catheter. Now the 
Stone returns on the ragged Side 
to keep up the Pain, and Provoca-
tion.
