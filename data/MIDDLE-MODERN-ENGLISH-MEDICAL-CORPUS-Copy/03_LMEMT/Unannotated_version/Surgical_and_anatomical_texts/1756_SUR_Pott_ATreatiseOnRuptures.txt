[}SECT. I. }]BY the term rupture, hernia, 
or descent, is meant a tu- 
mor produced by the fal- 
ling down or protrusion of some 
part or parts which should na- 
turally be contained in the cavity 
of the belly. 

|P_2
The places in which these 
parts make their appearance in 
order to form what is called a 
rupture, are the groin, the scro- 
tum, the navel, the labia pu- 
dendi, the upper and sore part 
of the thigh, and every point of 
the anterior part of the belly. 
The parts principally liable to 
suffer this protrusion, or descent, 
are a part of the omentum or 
caul, a portion of the intes- 
tines, and sometimes (tho' very 
rarely) a portion of the stomach. 

From these two circumstances 
of situation and contents, are de- 
rived the different appellations by 
which the different kinds of rup- 
|P_3
tures are distinguished from each 
other. 

From their situation they are 
called inguinal, scrotal, femoral, 
umbilical, or ventral ruptures, 
as they happen to make their ap- 
pearance in the groin, scrotum, 
thigh, navel, or belly. 

If the prolapsed body be a por- 
tion of intestine, the tumor is 
called enterocele, hernia intesti- 
nalis, or intestinal rupture; if it 
is omentum, it is called epiplo- 
cele, hernia omentalis, or omen- 
tal rupture; if both intestine and 
caul conspire to form the tumor, 
the name is compounded of both 
contents, and is called entero- 
epiplocele. 

|P_4
The vulgar supposition that 
these bodies descend thro' pas- 
sages forcibly made by breach or 
laceration of the containing parts, 
is not true; at least with regard 
to the inguinal, scrotal, femoral 
and navel ruptures: the aper- 
tures by which the three former 
descend are natural to every hu- 
man body, as well those who 
have not, as those who have rup- 
tures, and permit the transit of 
the caul, or gut only by being 
dilated. The principal passages 
are those on each side of the 
lower part of the belly near the 
groin, thro' the tendon of one 
of the abdominal muscles; and 
the hollow formed under what 
is commonly called Poupart's or 
|P_5
Fallopius's ligament, in the up- 
per and fore part of the thigh; 
through the former the spermatic 
vessels pass to the testicles in men, 
and the ligamenta uteri in wo- 
men; and thro' the latter the 
great crural vein and artery 
to the thigh and leg in both 
sexes. 

A short anatomical description 
of these parts is somewhat ne- 
cessary to understand rightly the 
true nature and situation of this 
disease. The pair of muscles 
called obliqui externi or descen- 
dentes, cover all that part of the 
belly which is without bone, and 
the lower and fore part of the 
thorax; they are fleshy on the 
sides, and tendinous in the mid- 
|P_6
dle and lower part; they spring 
from the seventh and eighth ribs 
and all below them, by fleshy 
portions which indigitate with 
corresponding portions of two 
other muscles called the serratus 
major anticus, and latissimus dorsi, 
and becoming tendinous are in- 
serted into the linea alba, spine 
of the os ileum and the os pubis. 

What is called Poupart's or 
Fallopius's ligament, is nothing 
more than the lower border of 
this tendon stretched from the 
fore part of the os ileum or 
haunch bone, to the pubis: the 
tendinous fibres of this muscle 
as they proceed obliquely down- 
ward, diverge and leave several 
small apertures for the passage of 
|P_7
vessels and nerves, and as they 
are inserted into the pubis they 
cross each other and are interwo- 
ven, by which the insertion is 
much strengthened. 

At the lower part of the belly, 
a little above the pubis, the fibres 
of these tendons separate from 
each other, and form thereby a 
large oval aperture on each side, 
just above the groin, thro' which 
pass the spermatic vessels to the 
testicles in men and the ligamenta 
uteri in women, in whom this 
aperture is much smaller than it 
is in men; as the ligamentum 
uteri is also much smaller than 
the spermatic chord. 

|P_8
The other muscles of the belly 
having no immediate concern 
with the present subject, I shall 
take no other notice of them 
than only to observe, that the 
spermatic chord does not pass 
thro' any openings in these, but 
under the lower edge or border 
of two of them, (viz. the obli- 
quus internus, and transversalis) 
at such distance and in such man- 
ner, that no action of these mu- 
scles can make any stricture up- 
on it. 

The inside of these muscles, 
and indeed the whole cavity of 
the belly, is lined by a smooth, 
firm, but easily dilatable mem- 
brane called the peritoneum, a 
|P_9
minute anatomical description of 
which would lead me beside my 
present purpose; let it suffice to 
observe, that it lines the whole 
cavity of the belly, and gives an 
external coat to all the viscera 
contained in it. 

Behind the peritoneum lies a 
loose cellular membrane called 
its appendix; this is found in 
very different quantity in differ- 
ent places, in some it is plenti- 
fully stocked with fat, in others 
it is void of fat, and is the same 
sort of cellular membrane as is 
found all over the body. 

This cellular membrane (void 
of fat) enveloping the spermatic 
chord is called the tunica vagi- 
|P_10
nalis communis, or tunica vagi- 
nalis of the chord; which chord 
thus enveloped, passes out from 
the cavity of the belly, under 
the edge of the transversalis, and 
internal oblique muscles, and 
thro' the aperture in the tendon 
of the external oblique, just a- 
bove the groin. 

The hernia or rupture in its 
sac (soon to be described) is push- 
ed from the cavity of the abdo- 
men thro' the same aperture, and 
insinuates itself into the tunica 
vaginalis, in such manner, as to 
be totally enveloped by it, and 
to lye anterior to the spermatic 
vessels, or chord. 

|P_11
The tunica vaginalis testis is a 
distinct membrane, forming a di- 
stinct cavity, including the testicle 
and a small quantity of limpid 
fluid. 

The acknowledged use of the 
muscles of the belly is to expel the 
fæces and urine, to help the di- 
gestive organs by gentle and 
frequent compression, to assist in 
the act of vomiting, and by de- 
pressing the ribs and forcing the 
diaphragm upward to contribute 
to expiration. 

By the action of these and of the 
muscles of respiration, the con- 
tents of the belly are continually 
pressed upon, and in some actions 
|P_12
and exertions of strength pressed 
on with great, and sudden force, 
and as our erect posture favours 
the descent of the contained parts 
toward those places which lie low 
and are little defended, a portion 
of gut, or caul will sometimes 
slip through, and the less the 
natural strength of the subject, 
the more likely will this be to 
happen, which is one reason why 
children are more subject to this 
disorder than adults. 

This is the most probable and 
natural account of the origin of 
the ruptures of children and 
adults, but will not account for 
those of infants, in whom we 
very frequently find them soon 
after birth, when erect posture 
|P_13
can have had no share in their 
production. 

If the testicles of a fœtus were 
down in the scrotum, depen- 
dent from the spermatic chord, 
as they are in an adult, they 
would in some postures and dis- 
positions of the child at the time 
of parturition be very liable to be 
hurt; to prevent which, and 
possibly for other reasons also, 
the testicles of a fœtus during 
its residence in the uterus, lie 
within the abdomen, behind the 
peritoneum, defended by the 
bone; soon after birth, when the 
lungs come to be distended with 
air and press on the diaphragm, 
when the muscles of respiration 
act, and those of the abdomen 
|P_14
begin to squeeze the contents of 
the belly, the testicles are pushed 
out thro' the apertures in the ab- 
dominal muscle (called the rings) 
into the upper part of the scro- 
tum: This passage of the testicle 
from the belly into the scrotum, 
I take to be the principal cause 
of the ruptures of infants, for 
the ring or aperture being by 
this means dilated, a portion of 
caul or gut has an opportunity 
of slipping thro' before the aper- 
ture has had time to contract it- 
self again, and which protrusion 
will be forwarded by the con- 
tinual efforts of the child in 
crying. 

This has always appeared to 
to me to be the case; and in this 
|P_15
I am more confirmed by observ- 
ing that almost all the infants 
that are ruptured within the first 
five or six months of their life, 
are males. But whether this is 
the case or not, certain it is, that 
the greater part of ruptures have 
their rise in early infancy, are 
produced gradually, are very 
small at their first appearance, 
and are seldom seen or regarded 
in children, till they have got be- 
low the groin, more or less into 
the scrotum. 

This descent or protrusion will 
happen frequently, when the in- 
fant strains to cry, or to empty 
the intestines of fæces, and will 
return up again as soon as the 
child is quiet; the nurses call it 
|P_16
wind, and it is generally at first 
neglected, the child not being 
apparently injured, and the peo- 
ple about it not knowing the 
consequence. 

Neither the intestine nor o- 
mentum can descend thro' either 
of the above-mentioned aper- 
tures in the groin or belly, with- 
out thrusting before them a por- 
tion of the peritoneum, in form 
of a bag or pouch, not unlike 
what is called a thumbstal, in 
which the piece of gut or caul 
is included; this is called the 
hernial sac; and as this descent 
will frequently happen unregard- 
ed, from the manner in which 
our children are cloathed, and 
the few opportunities we have of 
|P_17
seeing them naked, this sac, con- 
sisting of a fine and easily dilata- 
ble membrane, will by each de- 
scent be prolonged or lengthened, 
and pass gradually from the groin 
into the scrotum. 

It has been the opinion of some, 
and, among the rest, of Mr. Che- 
selden, that the sac of a hernia 
is not an elongation of the peri- 
toneum, but formed like the sac 
of an aneurism, and that of some 
other tumors, by the thickening 
of the common membranes from 
pressure and obstruction: how- 
ever true this may be in some 
cases, it most certainly is not so 
with regard to the present, the 
hernial sac being clearly and de- 
monstrably a portion of the pe- 
|P_18
ritoneum, lengthened gradually 
by the descent of its contents, 
and becoming thicker as it is 
lengthened. 

Whether the sac in its infant 
state, while it is very thin and 
has contracted no adhesions, ever 
re-ascends into the belly with 
the intestine, I will not pretend 
to determine; but am much in- 
clined to think it does not, from 
the facility with which the parts 
composing a rupture descend, 
after they have been few times 
down, and from a fulness which 
may generally be felt along the 
process of such children as have 
been ruptured; some few of 
which I have had an opportunity 
of opening after death, and have 
|P_19
always found the sac in the 
scrotum. 

From the natural laxity of the 
whole frame of infants, from the 
softness and flexibility of their 
fibres, and from their frequent 
efforts in crying, this protrusion 
or descent will happen frequent- 
ly; when down, the nurse's hand 
or a warm cloth generally serve 
to return it; and, as I said be- 
fore, it passes for wind and is 
neglected, till it happens to be 
seen by some person of judgment, 
or creates trouble to the child. 

This is the general date, ori- 
gin, and first rise of this disease; 
but to this there are several ex- 
ceptions: There are many in- 
|P_20
stances of ruptures making their 
first appearance in adults, who 
have not been ruptured while 
they were infants; and there are 
several instances of ruptures pro- 
duced by efforts, blows, &c. in- 
stantaneously: but the most fre- 
quent origin is that which I have 
mentioned; and by what has 
come within my observation, it 
has appeared to me that the ge- 
nerality of the scrotal hernias of 
adults have been derived from 
childhood, and those ruptures 
which have made their first ap- 
pearance in mature age, have ge- 
nerally remained inguinal rup- 
tures. 

I take no notice of the old dis- 
pute about the dilatation or la- 
|P_21
ceration of the peritoneum, as it 
is agreed by every body, and in- 
deed is plainly demonstrable 
that the peritoneum is dilated to 
form the hernial sac, but tho' 
dilated to a very great degree, 
yet always remains entire; the 
case, quoted by Mr. Sharp, of 
the intestine being found in con- 
tact with the testicle, being an 
accidental thing, and to be rank- 
ed as such, or as one of the lu- 
sus naturæ. 

The signs of an inguinal or 
scrotal rupture are a tumor in 
the groin or upper part of the 
scrotum, beginning at the ring 
of the abdominal muscle, and 
extending more or less down- 
ward; which tumor appears dif- 
|P_22
ferently to the touch, according 
to its different contents. 

If a portion of intestine forms 
the tumor, and that portion is 
not a very small one, its surface 
is smooth and renitent, but 
much more so upon the actions 
of coughing, sneezing, &c. up- 
on every effort of which it feels 
as if it was blown into. 

If a piece of omentum has 
slipped down, it has a more flab- 
by feel, seems to have a more 
unequal surface, makes less re- 
sistance to the finger, and gives 
the scrotum a less round figure; 
and if the portion is large and 
the subject adult, it is in some 
measure distinguishable by its 
|P_23
weight; if it consist of both in- 
testine and omentum, the judg- 
ment to be formed by the touch 
will be less clear and distinct; but 
in this as well as many other parts 
of surgery, there is a tactus eru- 
ditus, which may be obtained 
by practice and reflection, but 
of which no clear idea can be 
verbally conveyed. 

The intestine most frequently 
found in a scrotal hernia, is a 
portion of the ileum, though it 
is no very uncommon thing to 
find a portion of the colon and 
the cœcum with the appendicula 
vermiformis. 

The only diseases with which 
this can possibly be confounded 
|P_24
are the hydrocele, and that de- 
fluxion on the testicle called her- 
nia humoralis. In the hernia 
humoralis the testicle and epidi- 
dymis are plainly to be felt, and 
their hardness discovered; and 
in the hydrocele, however full 
the cyst may be, it plainly ter- 
minates at the ring of the mus- 
cle; beside which, the fluctua- 
tion of the water, and the ab- 
sence of painful symptoms, will 
plainly point out this disease, 
and distinguish it from a hernia, 
to any man at all acquainted 
with either. 

Upon the reduction of the 
parts by the hand, if the rupture 
consisted of a portion of intestine 
only, it generally slips up at 
|P_25
once, makes a kind of gugling, 
which may sometimes be heard, 
but always may be distinguished 
by the finger, and leaves the 
scrotum quite free from any pre- 
ternatural body; is it consisted 
of a piece of omentum, it re- 
turns up more gradually and 
without any of that sensation to 
the finger which the intestine 
produced; if it consists of both 
intestine and omentum, the in- 
testine generally goes up first, 
leaves a flabby kind of body be- 
hind which is returnable also, 
but not in the same manner as 
the intestine, inasmuch as it re- 
turns more gradually and gene- 
rally requires to be followed by 
the finger to the last. 

|P_26
Ruptures differ from each o- 
ther, not only in the place of 
their appearance, and in their 
contents, which make their ge- 
neral difference; but each in- 
dividual rupture has some parti- 
cular circumstances which are 
necessary to be considered in or- 
der to form a right judgment of 
it: These are the subject in 
whom it appears, its date, its 
symptoms, and the probability 
or improbability of its being re- 
turnable. 

If the subject is an infant it is 
not often attended with much 
difficulty or trouble, the soft- 
ness and ductility of their fibres 
generally render reduction easy; 
|P_27
and though from neglect or inat- 
tention it may fall down again, 
yet it is again easily returned, 
and at this time of life seldom 
produces any mischief. I say 
seldom, because there are in- 
stances to the contrary, and I 
have, myself, seen an infant un- 
der a year old die of a strangu- 
lated hernia, with all the symp- 
toms of mortified intestines, tho' 
the rupture had been down but 
two days. 

If the subject is adult, and in 
the vigor of life, the conse- 
quences of neglect or male-treat- 
ment are more to be feared than 
at any other time of life, for rea- 
sons which are very obvious. 

|P_28
The great and principal mis- 
chief to be feared, in all de- 
scents of the intestine, is a stric- 
ture; this stricture is made by 
the borders of the aperture in 
the tendon, through which the 
intestine passes from the belly in- 
to the groin or scrotum; and it 
must be obvious, that the more 
the natural strength of the sub- 
ject is in general, and the more 
liable to inflammation, the more 
probability there will be of stric- 
ture, and the more mischief that 
stricture will be likely to pro- 
duce. 

Hence it must evidently ap- 
pear, that if the subject is adult 
and in the vigor of life, at which 
|P_29
time the solids are most elastic, 
the impulse of the heart strong- 
est, and the circulation of the 
fluids most brisk, that the con- 
sequences of neglect or mis- 
conduct must be more hazard- 
ous than in the soft, flaccid 
state of infancy, or the languid 
circulation of old age. 

In very old people the symp- 
toms do not usually run so high 
as in young, as well on account 
of more languid circulation, as 
that their ruptures are generally 
of antient date and the parts 
much relaxed. But then it should 
also be observed, that they are by 
no means exempt from inflam- 
matory symptoms, and that 
when such do occur, the una- 
|P_30
voidable infirmity of old age is 
no favourable circumstance in 
the treatment which may become 
necessary. 

With regard to the date of the 
disease, if it is of some standing, 
has been neglected, and has been 
frequently down without giving 
any trouble, the aperture in the 
tendon and the hernial sac may 
both be presumed to be large; 
which circumstances render im- 
mediate reduction rather less ne- 
cessary; on the contrary if the 
hernia be recent, or (tho' old) 
has been generally kept up, its 
immediate reduction is absolute- 
ly necessary, inasmuch as the 
risque of stricture is in these cir- 
cumstances much greater. 

|P_31
If the rupture is very large 
and antient, the patient far ad- 
vanced in life, the intestine does 
its duty in the scrotum, and no 
other inconvenience attends it 
than that produced by its weight, 
it will be better not to at- 
tempt reduction, inasmuch as it 
will most probably be fruitless, 
and the necessary handling may 
prove troublesome: this must be 
understood of those which are 
not attended by any symptoms 
of stricture, such symptoms mak- 
ing reduction absolutely necessary 
at all times, and in every cir- 
cumstance. 

With regard to contents, if 
it is omentum only, and has 
|P_32
been gradually formed, it seldom 
produces any bad symptoms; 
though its weight may become 
very troublesome; but if pro- 
duced suddenly by effort or vio- 
lence, it will sometimes prove 
very painful, and cause very 
troublesome symptoms, the con- 
nection between the omentum 
and stomach being such as to 
make the descent of a large piece 
of the former productive of nau- 
sea, and vomiting: when en- 
gaged in a stricture it has been 
the cause of still worse symptoms 
by becoming gangrenous; and 
though it should not be attended 
by any bad symptoms dependent 
on itself, as a mere omental 
rupture, yet it may, upon any 
extraordinary effort or exertion 
|P_33
of strength, be productive of an 
intestinal hernia and all its con- 
sequences by keeping the ring 
and sac constantly open. 

If it is a portion of intestine 
only which forms the hernia, 
the risque is greater, strangula- 
tion being more likely to hap- 
pen and more productive of mis- 
chief when it has happened; the 
smaller the portion of gut is 
which is engaged, the tighter 
the stricture binds, and the more 
hazardous the consequences. I 
have seen a fatal gangrene in a 
bubonocele in less than thirty 
hours, in which the piece of 
gut did not exceed an inch, and 
had never been down before. 

|P_34
Every thing considered, I 
think, it may be allowed, with 
some few exceptions, that an 
intestinal rupture, considered in a 
general sense, is subject to symp- 
toms and to danger, which an 
omental rupture is not subject 
to; that bad symptoms are more 
likely to attend recent ruptures 
than old ones; that a descent 
of intestine only, is rather more 
likely to produce mischief than 
when it is accompanied by a 
piece of omentum; and that no 
true and proper judgment can be 
formed of any hernia, unless e- 
very circumstance relative to it is 
duly considered. 

|P_35
The cure of a rupture has al- 
ways been divided into perfect 
or radical, and imperfect or pal- 
liative; a distinction, which tho' 
just and true, and founded upon 
reason and experience, has, by 
being misunderstood, been the 
occasion of much undeserved 
censure on the profession. 

The means used to procure 
both kinds of cure are exactly 
the same, and the event is de- 
pendent on causes which the sur- 
geon can neither foresee nor di- 
rect. 

This is a seeming paradox 
which mankind in general do 
not understand, an anatomical 
|P_36
acquaintance with the parts con- 
cerned in the disease being 
absolutely necessary to such 
knowledge. They conceive that 
the means made use of to pro- 
duce a radical cure are, or should 
be very different from those made 
use of merely to palliate; and 
this conception, or rather mis- 
conception, lays them open to 
all the fraud and delusion of im- 
postors. 

To labour under a trouble- 
some disorder, perhaps in the 
most active and joyous part of 
life, and to be told that a pal- 
liative cure by wearing a ban- 
dage is all that can be ex- 
pected is very disagreeable; the 
true reason of this, they are 
|P_37
not acquainted with, and are 
easily induced to believe what is 
insinuated to them, viz. that the 
regular part of the profession are 
deficient in the knowledge of the 
proper treatment of this disease; 
their application is therefore made 
to those who promise most; quod 
volumus facile credimus; igno- 
rance of the true nature of the 
disease, and a strong desire to be 
cured on one side, and bold and 
plausible assurances on the other, 
carry on the delusion, till time 
and the continuance of the rup- 
ture evince the truth and prove 
the fraud, which the patient, 
tho' perfectly convinced, will 
often join in concealing, either 
to avoid being laughed at for 
|P_38
his credulity, or to prevent a dis- 
covery of his infirmity. 

All that can be done by sur- 
gery toward the cure of a her- 
nia, is to replace the prolapsed 
body or bodies in the cavity of 
the belly, and to prevent them 
from slipping out again. 

This is all that art can do in 
either sex and in every age; but 
nature, according to the age of 
the patient, the date of the rup- 
ture, the sort of rupture, and 
some other circumstances, is ca- 
pable when properly assisted, 
(and not interrupted) of doing 
more, and of confirming that 
as a perfect cure in some, which 
|P_39
in others she is obliged to leave 
imperfect, and constantly requir- 
ing the assistance of art. 

When the portion of gut or 
caul, or whatever formed the 
tumor, is perfectly and properly 
replaced in the belly, and an op- 
portunity thereby given to the 
tendinous aperture to contract 
itself, and for a proper bandage 
to bring the sides of the entrance 
of the hernial sac as near toge- 
ther as it will admit, the sur- 
geon has done his part, the rest 
is nature's; and whether these 
parts will so contract as to pro- 
hibit a future descent or not, is 
matter of uncertainty and not to 
be known but from the event. 

|P_40
This every judicious man 
knows, and every honest man 
will say. 

All the pretensions which have 
in all times been made by dif- 
ferent people to remedies endu- 
ed with such virtues as to be 
capable of consolidating the parts 
supposed to be tore, or of con- 
stringing those which are dilated, 
have all proved inefficacious, and 
delusive, to say the best of them; 
the parts most immediately con- 
cerned in this disease are quite 
out of the reach of any appli- 
cations; and all the relief which 
the patients of these pretenders 
have found has been from the 
long rest to which they have 
|P_41
been subjected, or the strict ban- 
dage which they have wore. 
Many of these people having 
never worn any bandage at all 
before, are easily persuaded that 
the relief which this has given 
to them, has been produced by 
the applications which have been 
made to the part, or by the me- 
dicines which they have taken, 
all which were used merely to 
deceive them, and which never 
had, nor ever can have, any share 
in the cure of a rupture. 

By what has been said, I 
would not be understood to 
mean, that when the gut or caul 
are once replaced, the patient 
can receive no farther benefit 
from surgical assistance: nor that 
|P_42
every rupture in adults or persons 
of mature age is incapable of 
cure: this is far from my mean- 
ing, and far from truth: there 
are many circumstances in rup- 
tures and ruptured patients which 
require frequent assistance, with- 
out which the probability of a 
cure will be much less: and 
there are many ruptures in per- 
sons of mature age which will 
admit of perfect cure, if proper- 
ly and judiciously managed from 
the first. 

I only mean to obviate the 
vulgar prejudice so constantly en- 
couraged by all quacks, that there 
are medicines and applications 
which are specific in the cure of 
this disease; and of which they 
|P_43
they are possessed, neither of 
which is true. 

A few words may serve to ex- 
plain this matter. The general 
doctrine is, that the ruptures of 
infants, and those of very young 
subjects, generally admit of per- 
fect cure: those of adults less 
frequently, and those of old peo- 
ple hardly ever: all which is, 
in general, true. 

The difference between these 
three general states is principally, 
if not entirely, owing to the 
different state of the hernial sac 
and tendinous aperture at these 
different ages. 

|P_44
The hernial sac has been de- 
scribed as being a production or 
elongation of the peritoneum, 
thrust down before the body, 
which by its descent from the 
belly forms the hernia; at first 
(that is while the hernia is re- 
cent) this sac is small and thin, 
and, as I observed before (to use 
a familiar image) like a thumb- 
stal, or the extremity of a fin- 
ger of a glove cut off; it hard- 
ly ever (if ever) returns into the 
belly after it has been once down, 
but by repeated descents of the 
caul or gut into it, being of a 
very dilatable nature, is con- 
tinually lengthened and inlarged; 
when it has got below the groin 
into the scrotum, it acquires a 
pyrisorm or pear-like figure, with 
|P_45
its neck or narrow part next the 
abdomen, and its broadest part 
expanded more or less in the 
scrotum, according to the size, 
date, and quantity of contents; 
in young subjects, and recent 
ruptures, it is very thin, but in 
proportion as it is extended in 
length it increases in thickness, 
and in time acquires a very con- 
siderable degree of thickness, 
firmness and hardness. 

In infants, in very young sub- 
jects, and in recent cases, this sac 
from its thin soft state, is ca- 
pable of having its upper nar- 
row part or neck so compressed 
by proper bandage, as possibly 
to procure an unition of the 
sides of it, at least so to lessen 
|P_46
the passage of it as to prevent 
the future descent of any thing 
into it from the abdomen; which 
produces a perfect cure. 

In those of mature age, or 
whose ruptures are of some stand- 
ing, and consequently the neck 
or entrance of the sac large in 
proportion to the age, size of 
the subject, and date of the rup- 
ture, the membranes composing 
it being more thick, firm, and 
hard, the compression of its 
neck so close as to prevent the 
passage of any thing through 
it, is more difficult, and 
uncertain. In old age, and 
old ruptures, the still greater 
firmness and hardness of the 
sac, render it less compressible, 
|P_47
and consequently the occlusion 
of the passage by this means still 
more impracticable. 

From this account of the dif- 
ferent state of the hernial sac it 
must appear, that all these cir- 
cumstances will be very various in 
different persons; that not only 
the difference of age in the sub- 
ject, and date of the rupture, 
but that of habit, constitution, 
&c. must produce a great va- 
riety in these cases, and conse- 
quently that the precise age and 
subject that will or will not ad- 
mit a perfect cure, must be very 
uncertain, and not in the power 
of the most judicious man to 
determine absolutely, tho' from 
many circumstances he will ge- 
|P_48
nerally know when it is very 
improbable or impossible. 

From the same considerations 
it will appear that recent rup- 
tures, if immediately and pro- 
perly taken care of, admit a 
perfect cure at almost any age; 
as do also most of those which, 
tho' in adult subjects, are got no 
lower than the groin. 

From the same consideration, it 
will appear, that tho' the firmness 
of the hernial sac, and the large- 
ness of the abdominal aperture 
are always mentioned as two 
causes of the difficulty or im- 
practicability of the cure of old 
ruptures, yet, in fact, the latter 
is the effect of the former; a 
|P_49
thick, tough, incompressible 
purse passing thro' the aperture, 
and continnually dragged down- 
ward by a weight at its bottom, 
being a constant cause of dilata- 
tion. 

Hence also will appear the 
absurdity of all external applica- 
tions, they being designed, if they 
are used with any medical design 
at all, either to constringe the 
aperture by which the rupture 
has descended, or to lessen the 
diameter of the neck of the sac 
so as to prevent any future de- 
scent: The constriction of the 
aperture is absolutely impossible 
while such a wedge as an old, 
tough, hernial sac remains in it, 
which wedge will for ever re- 
|P_50
main, as it is not returnable in- 
to the belly whence it came, 
from adhesion to the spermatic 
chord and other parts; and the 
diameter of the neck can be les- 
sened by no applications, unless 
such could be found as could 
render the sac thin, soft and 
compressible; which from the 
nature of things, and from all 
experience, is absolutely impos- 
sible. 

It is scarcely credible, how 
very small an opening will serve 
for a portion of gut or caul to 
insinuate themselves into at some 
times: and though in many per- 
sons of mature age it proves im- 
practicable so to compress the 
mouth of the sac as absolutely to 
|P_51
close it, yet by the constant use 
of a well made bandage, it may 
be so lessened as to make the de- 
scent of any thing from the belly 
more difficult; from whence we 
may learn, the great consequence 
of having the part compleatly 
returned before the application 
of a bandage, and the danger 
that may be incurred by disusing 
or laying it by after it has been 
wore some time: for whatever 
can make the descent from the 
belly less easy, must necessarily 
make the return of any part that 
may have slipped down while the 
bandage was off, more difficult, 
the consequence of which is ob- 
vious. And from hence also we 
may learn, why the bandage 
should be long and unremitting- 
|P_52
ly wore by such young patients 
as have reason to expect a per- 
fect cure; one half of the scro- 
tal hernias of adults proceeding 
from the negligent manner in 
which school-boys wear their 
trusses. With a truss properly 
made, and carefully wore, the 
meaner kind of people may be 
rendered fit for all the offices of 
life, will be capable of labour 
of any kind, of walking, of ride- 
ing, &c. as all those find them- 
selves to be, who are willing to 
do these kind of things: and with 
regard to very old people with 
very old ruptures, no confine- 
ment however long, nor any ban- 
dage however strict, is capable 
of producing a perfect cure: 
that bandage which proves reten- 
|P_53
tive of the parts after they have 
been returned, will serve all the 
purposes of life, and in the cir- 
cumstances of these people, an 
attempt by a stricter kind of ban- 
dage has more than once proved 
fatal. 

|P_54
[}SECT. II. }]
TO replace the portion of 
intestine or caul which 
formed the tumor, and to re- 
tain it when replaced, has been 
allowed to be all that the art of 
surgery ultimately pretends to, 
toward the cure of a rupture; 
but as there are many different 
circumstances attending these 
parts, while in the groin or 
scrotum, the treatment of them, 
in order to accomplish these two 
ends, must necessarily be differ- 
ent. These circumstances are 
reducible to four general heads, 
under which may be compre- 
hended all the species of rup- 
tures, with every particularity 
|P_55
by which they differ from each 
other. 

The first comprehends those 
which are in such a state as to be 
capable of immediate reduction, 
and are not attended by any 
troublesome or bad symptoms. 

The second, those which have 
been so long in the scrotum as 
to have contracted adhesions and 
connections, by which they are 
rendered incapable of reduction 
at all. 

The third, those in which 
such stricture is made on the 
prolapsed parts, as to bring on 
pain and trouble; and to render 
|P_56
the reduction difficult as well as 
necessary. 

The fourth, those in which 
reduction, by the simple opera- 
tion of the hand, is impractica- 
ble, and the patient's life can 
be saved only by a surgical ope- 
ration. 

The first is most frequently 
the case of infants, whose rup- 
tures have been often down be- 
fore they have been taken no- 
tice of; many of them, after they 
have been observed, are only 
pressed back by the hand of the 
nurse, as often as they come 
down, or else return, sua sponte, 
upon the child being quiet or 
|P_57
laid supine; not but there have 
been instances of bad effects from 
stricture even in infants. 

An error which generally pre- 
vails among nurses, and has prov- 
ed detrimental to many a child 
is, that no proper bandage can 
be put upon them till after they 
are three or four years old. 

Upon this supposition they 
content themselves with a di- 
mity-belt or some more foolish 
contrivance of their own; by 
which the child loses so much 
time, and is daily in danger of 
farther misehief: whereas there 
is no age in which a proper ban- 
dage may not be wore; and by 
the timely use of such, some 
|P_58
children will have obtained a 
perfect cure by the time that 
others begin to use their ban- 
dage. 

The manner of returning the 
parts is the same at all times; 
therefore I shall defer saying any 
thing about it here, and shall de- 
scribe it once for all hereafter. 

If any difficulty attends it in 
such young subjects, it will al- 
ways be adviseable to try the ef- 
fect of bleeding, and a glyster or 
two, before any violence is offer- 
ed to the part. 

Children, especially very young 
ones, bear the loss of blood ill; 
that is, they are very apt to swoon 
|P_59
upon losing a small quantity; and 
if while the child is bleeding the 
tumor be properly grasped, and 
the opportunity of the deliquium 
embraced, there are few that will 
not return during that relaxa- 
tion: it is an easy experiment, 
can do no harm, and may pre- 
vent the pain that the necessary 
handling so tender a part in a 
young child must produce. The 
time of the swoon will also be 
attended by another advantage, 
viz. that of the child being quiet, 
and not resisting the attempt by 
crying. 

When the contents of the her- 
nia are returned, a proper ban- 
dage should be immediately put 
on and wore without remission, 
|P_60
care being taken to keep the child 
from being galled, by washing 
all the parts frequently where 
the truss makes any pressure, and 
keeping both child and bandage 
perfectly clean; by which cau- 
tion the truss will be very little 
trouble to the infant, and the 
perfect cure may almost certain- 
ly be depended upon. The pro- 
per make and adjustment of the 
truss, at this age, should be very 
carefully attended to by the sur- 
geon, inasmuch as the child can 
make no complaint, that will 
inform him of its being unfit, till 
some injury is done. 

The most frequent mischief 
aring from an ill made truss, in 
an infant, is an inflammation and 
|P_61
swelling of the spermatic chord 
and testicle, which is not only 
painful in itself, but prevents the 
wearing the bandage till it is 
gone off. 

Many adults also have ruptures 
in the same circumstances as these 
of infants, which give them 
little or no trouble, are return- 
able at any time by the hand, 
and go up when the patient lies 
down. 

In most of these the aperture 
in the abdominal muscle is very 
large, and if they put on a truss, 
which is not properly made and 
fitted exactly, the gut will slip 
down behind it in some particu- 
lar postures. 

|P_62
This is a circumstance well 
worth the attention of the per- 
son who has such sort of rup- 
ture; for though in these cases 
the aperture in the tendon is so 
large, as to leave little room to 
apprehend a stricture, yet pres- 
sure made by the bolster of a truss 
on a portion of intestine, while 
down in the sac, may prove of 
the most fatal consequence, and 
therefore people in these circum- 
stances are safer without any 
truss at all than with a bad one, 
or one that will not keep the gut 
from coming down. This ap- 
pearance of safety, from a large 
aperture and easy reduction, is 
not to be depended upon as cer- 
tain, many things may happen 
|P_63
to alter this state; an inflam- 
mation of the intestine while in 
the scrotum, the accession of a 
new portion of gut and mesen- 
tery, with many other circum- 
stances which may happen to 
render the return now difficult 
which before was easy; all which 
are strong and good reasons, for 
constantly keeping up the parts 
by a well made truss, the wear- 
ing which cannot possibly be so 
troublesome as the weight of the 
parts in the scrotum; to say no- 
thing of the safety of one me- 
thod, and the constant hazard of 
the other. 

I know a gentleman who has, 
for some years, had an omental 
rupture, which being neglected 
|P_64
while he was young, having 
a lax habit, and the abdomi- 
nal ring naturally large, makes 
it extremely difficult for him 
to keep it up with the best 
made truss, behind which it will 
sometimes slip down; when this 
happens, it gives him such im- 
mediate and acute pain at the 
bottom of his stomach, and 
makes him so intolerably sick, 
that he is obliged to throw him- 
self upon his back immediately 
and procure the return of the 
omentum, which, from the same 
cause that makes its descent so 
easy, is easily accomplished. 

|P_65
[}SECT. III. }]
THE ruptures comprehend- 
ed under the second head, 
are those which from the large- 
ness of the prolapsed parts, from 
the antient date of the hernia, 
and from connections and adhe- 
sions, are become irreducible, but 
are not attended by any bad 
symptoms. 

Of this sort there are many, 
who from a natural laxity of ha- 
bit, from having the abdominal 
aperture naturally large, and 
from having long neglected their 
complaint, have carried a large 
quantity of caul or intestine, or 
both, in the scrotum for a great 
|P_66
length of time, where the in- 
testine has executed its office 
without interruption, and the 
patients have contented them- 
selves with wearing a suspen- 
sory or bag-truss, to support the 
weight. 

Most of these might have been 
returned at first; but, by neglect 
and length of time, become in- 
capable of any other remedy than 
the last mentioned, the suspen- 
sory. 

For the contents of the hernia, 
by long confinement in so nar- 
row a space, and by little slight 
inflammations, contract adhesions 
to each other, and to the internal 
surface of the sac, especially in 
|P_67
its narrower part or neck, in such 
manner as to make reduction im- 
practicable. 

When this is the case, the 
only relief is a bag-truss, so 
made, as to render the weight 
of the tumor as little trouble- 
some as possible. 

People in this situation should 
be particularly careful not to 
make any attempts beyond their 
strength, nor aim at feats of agi- 
lity, and should take care to 
keep the loaded scrotum out of 
the way of being hurt; when 
the tumor is very large, a soft 
quilted bolster should be con- 
stantly wore in the bag, under 
the bottom of the scrotum, and 
|P_68
frequently shifted to prevent ex- 
coriation which in corpulent peo- 
ple, and when the tumor is very 
large, frequently happens, and 
which, by being neglected, will in 
some habits be productive of still 
worse consequences. They should 
also take care to keep their body 
open, that there may be no im- 
pediment to the perfect and free 
execution of the office of the in- 
testinal canal, any obstruction in 
which, would be very prejudi- 
cial in these circumstances. 

By this means, and with these 
cautions, many people with ir- 
reducible ruptures have passed 
their time free from pain or dis- 
ease on this account. 

|P_69
Not that the quiet and inof- 
fensive state of these old irredu- 
cible ruptures is to be absolutely 
depended upon; for an inflam- 
mation of that part of the in- 
testine which is in the scrotum, 
and which may happen without 
any stricture; obstruction to the 
passage of the fæces from any 
cause; in short, whatever can 
disturb the proper office of the 
intestinal canal, may bring on 
mischief in this part: to which 
may be added, what sometimes 
happens, viz. the accession of 
a new piece of intestine, which 
may be strangulated, and then 
it becomes, to all surgical in- 
tents and purposes, a recent 
|P_70
hernia, and must be treated as 
such. 

I am well aware, that among 
the number of those which have 
been thought to be in this irre- 
ducible state, and have been treat- 
ed as such, there have been seve- 
ral, which upon more close exa- 
mination and proper treatment, 
have been found capable of re- 
duction. 

When this is suspected to be 
the case, the proper method is 
by absolute rest for a length of 
time; by a supine posture, and 
a course of evacuants; to en- 
deavour so to lessen the size of 
the prolapsed parts, as to render 
|P_71
them capable of passing back 
again into the belly. 

This method has sometimes 
succeeded, but previous to the 
attempt, there should be some 
circumstance which makes suc- 
cess probable; and there should 
be also good reason to believe 
that the patient's habit and age 
will bear the necessary confine- 
ment and evacuation, otherwise 
he may chance to be a great loser 
by the exchange of his disease. 

If the attempt succeeds, a 
proper truss must be put on 
immediately, and wore con- 
stantly, to prevent the parts 
from falling down again, which 
from the largeness of the tendi- 
|P_72
nous aperture, from the thick- 
ness and hardness of the hernial 
sac, and the great relaxation of 
the mesentery, is sometimes very 
difficult to accomplish, a large 
opening from the belly into the 
sac always remaining when the 
parts have been in this state any 
time. 

An omental rupture, which 
has been gradually formed, and 
suffered to remain in the scro- 
tum, is seldom attended with 
any bad symptoms, considered 
merely as a simple descent of 
the omentum; but by its resi- 
dence in the scrotum, having al- 
ways kept the mouth of the sac 
distended, it may thereby be the 
occasion of a descent of a por- 
|P_73
tion of intestine, and all its con- 
sequences. 

The omentum become adhe- 
rent, may inflame, and deposit 
in the sac a quantity of an acrid 
kind of fluid, which will give 
pain and trouble; or it may sup- 
purate in consequence of its in- 
flammation, and will thereby 
make it necessary to open both 
scrotum and sac; an instance of 
which I had an opportunity of 
seeing not long ago. 

I was desired to look upon a 
gentleman from whose scrotum 
near a pint of stinking brown se- 
rum had been discharged two or 
three days before by a trocar. 

|P_74
The account he gave of him- 
self was as follows; that he had 
for some years been subject to 
the descent of a soft flabby kind 
of body into the scrotum, which 
he could put up again when he 
pleased, and which always re- 
turned when he was in bed; be- 
ing naturally shy and bashful, he 
had never suffered any body to 
see it, and was himself quite un- 
acquainted with the nature of 
his disorder. 

From the sudden spring of an 
unruly horse, he struck his scro- 
tum against the pummel of his sad- 
dle, which gave him great pain; 
the next day it swelled and became 
|P_75
more painful; still fearful of men- 
tioning his disorder, he contented 
himself with daubing it over with 
some ointment, till at last it be- 
came so painful that he could no 
longer conceal it. 

The person to whom he shew- 
ed it took it for an hydrocele, 
tapped it, and let out the quan- 
tity and sort of fluid just men- 
tioned; in few days after this 
I saw it, and found the scrotum 
much distended, very thick, in- 
flamed, and painful. 

The orifice made by the trocar 
was sloughy, and seemed likely 
to cast off, and thereby become 
larger; he had a degree of heat 
and fever upon him, which for- 
|P_76
bade any operation at that time, 
and therefore I desired that he 
might be dressed with a digestive 
medicine and soft poultice, lose 
some blood, and have a glys- 
ster. 

By the application to his scro- 
tum, and by the use of proper 
medicines for his febrile heat, in 
few days the latter was removed, 
and the slough on the former 
casting off largely, I could plain- 
ly discover the putrid sloughy 
omentum within; I would have 
laid the whole open, but was not 
permitted, and could only ob- 
tain leave to inlarge the present 
orifice about a couple of inches; 
in doing which, I cut through 
a hernial sac of great thickness 
|P_77
and very hard: what part of the 
omentum was loose, I pulled 
away with my foreceps, but the 
separation of the whole took a 
great deal of time, and the hard 
hernial sac caused so many ab- 
scesses in the integuments of the 
scrotum, and the discharge upon 
the whole was so large, that be- 
ing a valetudinary kind of man, 
he had cetainly sunk under it, 
had it not been for the free use 
of the bark. 

If instead of this method of 
treating it, I had been permitted 
to have laid it open through 
its whole length, removed the 
omentum, and retrenched the 
hernial sac, the cure would have 
been much shortened, and the 
|P_78
scrotum would have been left in 
a much better state. 

That an omental rupture which 
has so long resisted all attempts 
for reduction, as to produce a be- 
lief of its being irreducible, may 
sometimes, by long rest and ab- 
stinence, be so altered, as to be- 
come capable of return, I make 
no doubt, and not long ago had 
a man, in St. Bartholomew's-Ho- 
spital, who had a small omental 
hernia, which myself and many 
others had ineffectually tried to 
reduce; it was very little below 
his groin in the very upper part 
of the scrotum. 

This man being confined to 
his bed, and a strict diet after the 
|P_79
operation for the radical cure of 
an hydrocele on the same side, 
got rid of both his diseases at the 
same time; for after he had been 
in bed about ten days, his omen- 
tum returned of itself into the 
abdomen. 

In performing the operation 
on this man, the two sacs, viz. 
that of the hydrocele made by 
the tunica vaginalis testis, and 
that of the hernia formed by the 
peritoneum, was very apparent 
and satisfactory. 

It sometimes happens in the 
case of an old descent of both 
gut and omentum, that the gut 
is returnable and the omentum 
not. When this is found upon 
|P_80
trial to be so, the gut should be 
returned and kept up by a 
truss, the pad of which may be 
so constructed, as to keep the 
intestine up without pressing on 
the omentum, so as to do it any 
injury; by which means the 
risque of mischief from stricture 
of the gut will be avoided, and 
the patient thereby freed from a 
constantly impending evil. 

Not long since, I saw a large 
portion of omentum in the scro- 
tum, a part of which had the 
knotty hardness, the acute pain, 
and indeed every symptom of a 
cancer. 

|P_81
[}SECT. IV. }]
THE third division compre- 
hends those ruptures which 
are reducible; but whose reduc- 
tion is difficult and attended with 
pain and trouble. 

This difficulty of reduction 
may be owing to several different 
causes; a large piece of omen- 
tum, a large portion of intestine 
and mesentery, the intestine be- 
ing inflamed, loaded with fæces, 
or distended by flatus, smallness 
of the abdominal ring, &c. &c. 
&c. but to whatever cause the 
difficulty is owing, the means 
to be used for its relief are the 
same. 

|P_82
The hernia in this state is cal- 
led an incarcerated hernia, a stran- 
gulated hernia, or a hernia with 
stricture, which stricture is more 
or less in degree in different cases; 
its symptoms are a swelling in 
the groin and upper-part of the 
scrotum, larger or smaller ac- 
cording to the quantity of con- 
tents, very painful to the touch, 
and renitent or resisting the im- 
pression of the fingers; the pain 
is increased by coughing or sneez- 
ing, or standing upright, a fre- 
quent vomiting, a suppression 
of all discharge per anum; to 
which may be added fever, with 
quick and hard pulse. These 
are the symptoms of a beginning 
strangulation, and consequently 
|P_83
symptoms of impending mischief, 
symptoms which if not soon re- 
lieved by art, nature must submit 
to. 

A stricture made by the bor- 
ders of the aperture in the ab- 
dominal muscle on the prolapsed 
part or parts, is the primary and 
principal cause of these symp- 
toms, and nothing can appease 
or remove them but what will 
take off that stricture; the two 
methods of accomplishing this 
end, are, removing the parts by 
replacing them in the belly 
whence they came, or dividing 
the stricture itself: the former is 
always most eligible when practi- 
cable, and is the subject of our 
present purpose. 

|P_83
A portion of intestine will, 
(as has been observed before) while 
there is no stricture above nor any 
inflammation below, remain per- 
fectly quiet in the scrotum, and 
will there execute all its offices 
freely and perfectly; but the 
instant it becomes straitened 
above, the case alters: the free 
passage of the fæcal part of the 
food is interrupted or stop- 
ped, the peristaltic motion of 
the intestines perverted, and the 
circulation of the blood through 
the incarcerated portion so im- 
peded, that if the impediment 
is not soon taken off it must 
stop, the consequence of which 
is obvious. 

|P_85
All the symptoms of an in- 
carcerated rupture are from these 
causes easily deducible and fairly 
to be accounted for. 

The tumor, the pain, the 
fever, the vomiting, the tension 
of the belly and suppression of 
stools, are so many links in a 
chain of symptoms, all evidently 
and certainly produced by one 
cause, the removal of which only 
can remove them. 

The manner of attempting the 
reduction is thus: The patient 
should be laid in a supine posture, 
with his buttocks and thighs con- 
siderably raised above his breast, 
when the surgeon taking up the 
|P_86
tumified scrotum, is to endea- 
vour to procure the return of the 
prolapsed parts thro' the aperture 
in the muscle by gentle and repeat- 
ed pressure of them towards the os 
ileum with one hand, while with 
the other he prevents their escape 
to the lower part of the scrotum. 

This is a general description of 
it; but the exact and proper 
manner of handling the tumor, 
and endeavouring the return of 
the parts, is one of those opera- 
tions, which having once done, 
or having seen it properly done, 
will convey a better and clearer 
idea of, than the most elaborate 
description; a competent know- 
ledge of the anatomical structure 
and situation of the parts, will 
|P_87
fully instruct any one how to go 
ahout it properly, and without 
such knowledge, though he may 
sometimes and by accident suc- 
ceed, yet he may full as often 
do mischief, and his surgery will 
be somewhat like that of the man 
who replaced his companion's 
dislocated jaw, by giving him a 
smart blow in the face. 

Great assistance is to be obtain- 
ed in this operation from posture, 
by raising the hips above the 
trunk; and indeed the nearer the 
posture approaches to that of 
standing upon the head (as it is 
called) the better, as it makes the 
whole pacquet of intestines hang, 
as it were, by the portion engaged 
in the stricture, and which will 
|P_88
therefore be more likely to fol- 
low. 

A little time and pains spent 
in this manner, will frequently 
be attended with success, and ob- 
tain a reduction; but if it does 
not, and the handling is very 
painful, and the patient much fa- 
tigued, it will be better to de- 
sist for few hours, take away a 
large quantity of blood, (as much 
as the strength and circumstances 
will admit) give a stimulating 
glyster or two, cover the whole 
tumor and scrotum with an emol- 
lient poultice, and confine the 
patient to bed. 

This is the general doctrine 
and the general and most ap- 
|P_89
proved practice, and founded on 
reason and experience. 

The glysters will not only emp- 
ty the rectum and the greatest 
part of the colon of what may be 
there, but the stimulus may per- 
haps do something more; and 
the poultice will relax the skin, 
and render the distension of that 
less painful, and therefore neither 
of them should ever be omitted; 
but the sheet anchor in this case is 
large bleeding frequently repeated. 

Perhaps there is no disease 
which affects the human body, 
not excepting pleurisy and pe- 
ripneumony, in which bleeding is 
more immediately serviceable than 
in this, and which, if there are no 
|P_90
very particular circumstances in 
the constitution to forbid it, should 
be done very freely and frequently, 
never forgetting to embrace the 
opportunity of a deliquium. 

A warm bath or semicupium 
are also useful in this state, from 
the general relaxation which they 
induce. 

Heister and some others, have 
said a great deal in commenda- 
tion of glysters of the fume of 
tobacco, repeated frequently, 
which as they can do no possible 
harm, may be worth trying. 

Many very good writers have 
recommended, and many able 
practitioners still continue to use 
|P_91
purging medicines, in this state of 
the disease, given in small doses, 
and frequently repeated; but I 
very much doubt, whether any 
part of the success they have had, 
has been deducible from these 
medicines. The advantage sup- 
posed is, that by accelerating the 
peristaltic motion the gut may be 
disengaged from the stricture and 
be drawn back into the belly. 
But when the stricture is so tight 
as to have brought on bad symp- 
toms, I much doubt the success 
of the experiment. 

Lenient medicines, whose form 
(whether solid or fluid) cannot be 
small, will not be retained by 
the stomach; and irritating medi- 
cines, whose bulk is small, are, 
|P_92
I think, more likely to add to 
the tension of the belly, already 
become very troublesome, than to 
disengage the intestine. If they 
do not answer that end, they can 
be of no service at all, and if 
they do no real service, 'tis much 
to be feared, they will do some- 
thing worse than nothing. 

They must increase the fulness 
of the small intestines above the 
confined portion, and conse- 
quently the tension of the belly; 
they must add to the irritation 
made against the stricture, and 
to the fever, and thirst, as all ir- 
ritating purges do at all times 
and in all bodies; however, this 
must be left to every man's own 
experience and judgment. 

|P_93
Aster few hours rest and a large 
bleeding, fresh trial should be made 
in the same manner as the first, al- 
always remembering that the less 
force is used the better, and that 
with regard to consequences, all 
violent attempts if they do not suc- 
ceed are worse than ineffectual. 

Hernias are in nothing more 
various than in the time which 
they will safely admit for at- 
tempting the reduction; some 
have been successfully reduced af- 
ter ten days, others have produced 
fatal symptoms in twice as many 
hours; this difference may arise 
from difference of constitution, 
habit of body, or from some par- 
ticular circumstance in the hernia 
|P_94
itself; but let the cause of this 
difference be what it will, as it 
can never be foreseen it should 
never be trusted, and the sooner 
the reduction is made, the sooner 
the patient is out of danger from 
the stricture, and the more like- 
ly to get rid of the symptoms it 
has already produced. 

Recent ruptures are rather 
more subject to stricture than 
old ones, inasmuch as the aper- 
ture in the muscle and the en- 
trance of the sac in antient hernias 
are more patent, and less likely 
to bind than in recent, in which 
the contrary, most probably, is the 
case, though when old ones are 
attended by stricture, the symp- 
toms are not at all lighter. 

|P_95
Omental hernias in general 
are not subject to stricture, or 
to any bad symptoms, though 
sometimes they will accidental- 
ly become very painful, and 
by the connection of the omen- 
tum with the stomach, will 
occasion a very disagreeable sen- 
sation, a nausea and vomiting; 
nay writers of undoubted cre- 
dit have related a passio ilia- 
ca, in all its force and symp- 
toms, from a mere epiplocele, 
without any portion of intes- 
tine. 

In the case of a large omental 
rupture, that has been down 
some time, it has been recom- 
mended to be content with a bag- 
|P_96
truss to suspend the weight, tho' 
the portion of omentum should 
be returnable; upon a supposition 
that if returned it will lie uneasy 
in a lump at the bottom of the 
belly. This seems to me to be 
one of those precepts which au- 
thors have taken from each other 
implicitly, without sufficiently at- 
tending to the consequences which 
it may produce. It may be true 
in some particular cases, but surely 
is by no means fit to be establish- 
ed as a general rule; and it must 
always be worth while to try how 
it will lie before it be given up to 
such a method, as hardly deserves 
the name of palliative, and which 
may be productive of other mis- 
chief. 

|P_97
The prolapsed parts replaced, 
the next consideration is how to 
keep them from falling down 
again. This can only be done by 
a proper bandage, so constructed, 
as to keep a gentle pressure against 
the aperture in the tendon thro' 
which the parts had passed, and 
to press the sides of the entrance 
of the sac as near together as pos- 
sible. 

The bandage now in general 
use for this purpose, is a truss; in 
the construction of, and adapting 
which to the part, some ingenuity 
is necessary; if it is not so made 
as to do good, it must do mis- 
chief; if it does not keep the 
parts up, the patient is more 
|P_98
likely to incur mischief with his 
truss on than without it; it will 
make a pressure on the intestine 
while down, which may prove 
very pernicious, and has often 
been the sole occasion of a gan- 
grene, in cases where there has 
been no stricture; therefore it 
behoves every surgeon to see that 
the truss applied is well made, 
and does its duty, lest all his 
pains should be baffled by the 
bad construction or injudicious 
application of this piece of ma- 
chinery. 

If the symptoms of pain and 
inflammation, &c, ran high be- 
fore the reduction, they will not 
always cease upon its being ac- 
complished; and as what symp- 
|P_99
toms remain, after the intestine 
is returned, arise most probably 
from its being inflamed, all such 
remedies as are proper and ne- 
cessary in an inflammation of the 
intestine, must be proper and 
necessary here; but above all, 
the body must be kept open un- 
til all pain and tightness, and in 
short, till every complaint of the 
parts about the abdomen is ab- 
solutely removed, and the in- 
testine performs all its offices 
freely and without trouble or ob- 
struction.
