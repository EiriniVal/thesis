[}Of the time of Searching and Cutting; 
of the Instruments; Of the Pa- 
tients Diet, and of the first Pre- 
paration for the Operation. }]
THE Patient may be search'd, 
or his Water drawn forth by 
the Catheter at any time, in order 
to discover the Disease. 

If he finds himself troubled 
with the Stone, it is dangerous to 
delay Cutting, and in some Pa- 
tients an immediate Operation is re- 
quir'd; but we shall not here speak 
of the time of Necessity, but on- 
ly of that of Election or Choice, 
which is laid hold of, when tho 
Distemper is in such a condition as 
to give opportunity to do things 
|P_120
in much order, and without any 
Precipitation. 

'Tis well known that the Spring
is the most Temperate Season in 
the Year, and gives Vigour and 
Strength to Mankind, which they 
find renewing in themselves as it 
were at that time, and then they 
undertake what was interrupted by 
the excessive Cold or Heat of o- 
ther Seasons. 

With great reason therefore, is 
the Spring-time to be chosen be- 
fore any other for many Operations, 
and especially for Lithotomy: And 
next to the Spring, the Autumn is to 
be preferr'd. 

But if a good Prognostic may be 
made and the Case requires it, the 
Patient may be Cut at any other 
time of the Year, due care being 
taken to guard agninst the Incle- 
mency of the Season. 

|P_

And now tho' Lithontriptics (of 
which I shall treat particularly at 
the latter end of this Book) and 
Menstruum's for dissolving the Stone 
have been in use, and mightily ex- 
toll'd by some Persons above these 
40 Years (but to no purpose, that 
ever I could find, they having prov'd 
mere Chimera's) yet here for the abso- 
lute Cure of the Stone in the Blad- 
der I am oblig'd to speak of Remedies
(if I may call them so) of Chirur- 
gery, which are Instruments if Iron, 
Silver or other Metals proper for 
Lithotomy; take here their Figures and 
the names of their Parts.

[}In the first Plate is describ'd. }]
1. A Raisor, to Shave the Hair 
from the Part where Incision is to 
be made. 
[^An illustration of a razor on the previous page. ^]
|P_122
2. Common Scissars for ordina- 
ry Incisions. 
[^An illustration of scissors on a previous page. ^]
3. A hollow Sound or Probe, 
call'd a Catheter, for searching of 
Men, and making them render 
Urine, and its Stilet or Wire to 
cleanse it. 
[^An illustration of a catheter on a previous page. ^]
4. A Catheter or Staffe, for 
making Incision upon in Men, fur- 
row'd on the back from A (which is 
the Bill or Bend) to B without any 
Cavity in its length. 
[^An illustration of a catheter on a previous page. ^]
5. A hollow Catheter and only 
crooked at the Bill, for searching 
of Women, and it's Wire for clean- 
sing it. 
[^An illustration of a catheter on a previous page. ^]
|P_123
6. A strait Catheter or Staffe, 
hollow'd and furrow'd from the 
Bill to C. It is sometimes us'd when 
Incision is made at the Orifice of the
Urethra. 
[^An illustration of a catheter on a previous page. ^]
7. A Bistori, that opens up like a 
Lancet, with a Point and Edge as 
that has, only the Point blunter, and 
at the other End it has a flat tail 
to keep it firm against the handle 
when it is open'd. 
[^An illustration of a scalpel on a previous page. ^]
8. A Roller to mount the Bistori, 
it must be slit at the End, be a Fin- 
ger broad, and a Foot and an half 
long. 
[^An illustration of a a strip of flexible material on a previous page. ^]
9. A Bistori mounted or arm'd 
with the Roller. 
[^An illustration of a scalpel with a strip of flexible material wrapped around it on a previous page. ^]
|P_124
10. Conductors or Probes, where- 
of a pair serves for the Operation, 
that which is next to the mounted 
Bistori, is forked, and the next to that 
has a Line in the length of its Cavity 
for guiding and conducting the 
former. Nevertheless that at Fi- 
gure 11. which is remotest from the 
Bistori may be used alone for con- 
ducting the Forceps, it being com- 
pos'd of the two former, turns 
with an Elbow about the middle, 
and has a Spring between the 
Branches near the Rings. 
[^An illustration of two probes and forceps on a previous page. ^]
[}In the Second Plate of Instruments 
is describ'd. }]
1. Another kind of Conductor, 
more commodious, and more in 
use than the others; It is hollow, 
taper, and grows narrow at the End, 
|P_
|P_125
where there is a Bill, that is to be in- 
troduced in the furrowing of the Ca- 
theter, whilst it is held by the other 
End, shap'd like a T. There are 
some that do not approve of this 
Conductor, alledging that it dilates the 
parts too much, and that it occasi- 
ons Fistula's, but without ground, 
for it is narrower than the Foreceps 
with which the Stone is drawn out, 
possesses less room, and causes not 
a Fistula, That being the Conse- 
quence of the Operation, as shall 
be explain'd in its proper place. 
[^An illustration of a probe on the previous page. ^]
2. Two Pair of Forceps, one 
Pair strait and the other Pair 
crooked. 

A. Their Teeth to fix in the Stone 
and hold it the faster. 
[^An illustration of two pairs of forceps on the previous page. ^]
|P_126
3. A Compound or great Dilatatory
for Men. 

D. The Bill. 

E. The Handle. 
[^An illustration of a dilatatory on a previous page. ^]
4. A simple Dilatatory for Wo- 
men; the Extremities of it are blunt 
and very small, the Branches are join'd 
in such a manner, that closing the one 
end, the other end opens, it represents 
the Letter X.
[^An illustration of a dilatatory on a previous page. ^]
5. Another Dilatatory that may 
serve for Women and little Boys: 
It has a Spring near the Handle, 
Dilates but moderately, and may be us'd 
with safety. 
[^An illustration of a dilatatory on a previous page. ^]
|P_127
6. A Hamulus or Hook to pull out 
the Stone or Stones that are in the 
passage, either in the lesser Opera- 
tion or otherwise. 
[^An illustration of a hook on a previous page. ^]
7. A Button or Scoop, about 10 In- 
ches long, and as big as a Quill. 

F. The part properly call'd the
Button. 

G. The other part which is hollow, 
and call'd the Scoop of the Button. 

H. A slight Line to conduct the
Forceps. 
[^An illustration of a scoop on a previous page. ^]
8. A Cannula, or hollow Tent- 
Pipe, having Rings at one End 
call'd the Head, the other End is 
call'd the Point, where there are 
|P_128
two holes, call'd the Eyes of the 
Tent. 
[^An illustration of a cannula on a previous page. ^]
9. A Fillet for mounting the 
Hollow Tent, introducing the Tent 
into the Slit in the middle of 
the Fillet, and putting the two Ends 
of the Fillet through the Rings of 
the Tent, then it is call'd a Tent
mounted, the Fillet is to be two 
Foot long, and a Finger broad. 
[^An illustration of a strip of flexible material on a previous page. ^]
10. Two Ligatures or Scarffs for 
Men and Women, they are made of 
Silk and Wool mix'd together, each of 
them must be Four or Five Ells long, 
and Four or Five Fingers broad; but 
if they cannot be immediately had, Bands 
of strong Linnen Cloath may be cut of 
the same length and breadth, which may 
afterwards be cut to serve for Trusses 
and for dressing the Patient. 
[^An illustration of two ligatures on a previous page. ^]
|P_129
11. An Extractor, for Extracting 
Stones out of the Penis or U- 
rethra. 
[^An illustration of an extractor on a previous page. ^]
In Hospitals they have a Chair
on which the Patient is to sit, to 
have the Operation perform'd; 
there are two Bars or Rods of Iron 
behind in form of Butteresses, and 
hooked at one end, that they may 
enter into the Rings of the Chair, and 
sharp at the other, that they may 
strike firm into the Floor and keep 
the Chair perfectly steady, in case the 
Patient strugles and uses Violence 
in the time of the Operation. The 
Chair must be placed a little ob- 
liquely, that the light may come 
on the Right hand of the Lithoto- 
mist, that he may see the better, 
when he is about the Operation. But 
instead of such a Chair, the Patient 
may as well be seated upon a Table
|P_130
with a Mastrass or Quilt over it, 
whereof one part must cover the 
back of a common Chair, set a- 
bout half a Foot distance from the 
edge of the Table in a sloaping 
manner. There must be also a 
Sheet folded long ways with many 
folds to cover the Chair or Table, 
and the Matrass in the time of the 
Operation. 

Most Lithotomists have their In- 
struments at that time orderly de- 
posited in a Budget made for that 
purpose, so as readily to be taken 
out when they find occasion. 

But I commonly put my In- 
struments in order in a Dish, causing 
a Servant to stand or kneel on one 
Knee, on my Right Hand to hold 
them ready for my use. 

It is fit that several Bistorys should 
be mounted or aim'd tho' there be 
but one Operation to be made, be- 
|P_131
cause their Points are something 
blunted in using; it is necessary 
also to have some Tow wound a- 
bout the Bistory to save the Point 
harmless before the Operation, and 
to have some Linnen Cloaths and 
Napkins in readiness. 

All the Instruments may be made 
of Steel, or Iron, or good tem- 
per'd Metal, that they may not 
bend in using. 

But the Catheters, Button, and 
Tent-Pipes are best made of Silver, 
that being less subject to Rust. 

It is always requisite to have in 
the Catheter-Box, a piece of Spunge 
moderately moist'ned with Oil of 
Roses, or Sallad-Oil, to Anoint the 
Catheter, otherwise it may some- 
times happen to be wanting when 
there is occasion for it. 

|P_132
Of each kind of Instruments there 
ought to be several, and those very 
well polish'd. 

Having spoken of the Instruments
of Surgery, we must likewise ac- 
cording to the Rules of Physic con- 
sider what other Things are neces- 
sary before, at, and after the Oper- 
ation, and concerning them we shall 
give methodical Instructions as 
follows. 

First, Let the Patient (if Pletho- 
ric) be blooded, taking away a 
good quantity, or rather bleed him 
more than once before Cutting, 
which will make him more easie, 
abate the Inflammation of the Bladder, 
and much lessen his Pain and Heat; 
but if the Patient be weak and feeble 
omit Bleeding: Let his Diet be 
Cooling, Moistening and of easie 
Digestion; his Drink pleasant Emul- 
|P_133
sions, fair Water with a brown 
Toast and one Glass of Canary: 
Let him be kept in a moderate 
temper; lying in a good Bed, not 
having to much Covering; keep 
his Body soluble and not Costive; 
and let his mind be as easie as his 
Case can bear. 

A cooling Lenitive Glyster is 
proper to be exhibited the Day be- 
fore the Operation. 

If Purging be requisite give the 
common Purge, cum Rhab. Tama- 
rind. & Manna cum Syr. Ros. So- 
lutiv. 

But in these Cases a Physician
should be call'd in, except the Li- 
thotomist be one himself, and yet 
tho' I one, I never hinder'd other 
Physicians coming, but am rather 
glad of their Company, always 
remembering that in the multitude 
of Counsel there is Safety. 

|P_134
Plus vident occuli quam occulus. 

In the Operation we are to take 
care to have good Cordials, good 
Assistants to hold the Patient, and 
good External Restringent Medica- 
ments. Oxyerat, and Oxyrhodinum are 
excellently useful. 

The Bandages, Plaisters, &c. as 
well for Men as Women must be 
prepar'd and laid in great readiness, 
they are as follows. 

1. A Ligature or Collar, which 
must be put over the Patient's 
Head, and hang down as low as 
the Navil: It is a great Band, and 
when the two Ends are ty'd toge- 
ther is of and Oval Figure, and 
may be put about the Patient be- 
fore the Operation. 

|P_135
2. A Bolster or Compress of a 
moderate thickness, Three or Four 
Fingers broad, to be put upon the 
Wound when the Patient is to be 
carried to Bed after the Operation is 
finish'd; it ought to be laid upon 
a Table, or upon a Plate by it 
self. 

3. An Astringent Plaister of a 
sufficient bigness to cover the 
Belly. 

4. A Belly-cloath, which is a 
great Bolster or Compress to cover 
the Belly, it is to be dipp'd in 
warm Oxycrat. 

5. A Bandage or Truss with Four 
Heads, which may be call'd Twins, 
because they begin in the same 
|P_136
place, and are design'd for one and 
the same use. 

6. A Truss like a double T. 
call'd the second Truss. 

7. A Pledget Plumacean, covered 
with Astringents. 

8. Astringent-Plaisters, of several 
Sizes. 

9. A Plaister longer then broad, 
and somewhat longer than the 
Wound, to be apply'd some Days 
after the Operation, over the Pledget. 

10. A small square Bolster or 
Compress indifferently thick, and 
somewhat larger than the Plaister. 

|P_137
11. Another double Compress or 
Truss for Men, an Inch broad and 
a Foot long. These two Bolsters
are to be moisten'd in warm Oxy- 
crat. 

12. A Ligature, or long Band 
to be Swathed above the Knees 
after the Wound is Dress'd, that the 
Patient may keep them within a 
moderate distance to one another. 

The Bed must also be prepar'd 
and cover'd with a Rolling Sheet, 
or a Sheet doubled into many folds; 
it must be laid cross the Bed, just in 
the Place where the Kidneys and 
Thighs of him that is to be Cut
are to Rest, and there must be se- 
veral Sheets ready to shift the Bed
when it is wet, which must also 
be warm'd with a Warming-Pan, 
|P_138
if it be needful: It is requisite also 
to have a good many Napkins in 
readiness to put under the Patient, 
when he has a Looseness, that he 
may be the sooner laid dry; some 
Lithotomists order a Cere-Cloath to be 
put betwixt the Sheets and the Bed, 
&c. to preserve it from being 
spoil'd by the Urine, but I generally 
order a fine Leather Skin, which is 
pleasanter to the Patient and does 
full as well: It is very necessary 
also, that a Cord be fast'ned to 
the top of the Bed, or some other 
place, by the help of which, the 
Patient may raise himself with the 
greater Ease when there's occasion: 
As soon as the Patient is laid in 
his Bed after the Operation, an Ano- 
dine draught must be given, that he 
may lie quiet and go to Sleep. 

|P_139
[}CHAP. X. }]
[}Of the Posture and Situation into 
which Children are put, when they 
are to be Cut. }]
ALL things being prepared, 
the Catheter's put into Oil, 
the Bistorys or Incision-Knives and 
Tents, mounted, a Tub with warm 
Water, plac'd underneath the Table, 
the Forcipes, Conductors, Button and 
Scoop and a Dilatory (it if be ne- 
cessary) all well plac'd, the Patient 
must be brought to the place of 
Operation and set upon the Chair, 
or Table prepar'd and fix'd a little 
obliquely, that the light from the 
Windows may dart upon the Right- 
side of the Lithotomist, (as before 
taught) who is to keep his Instru- 
|P_140
ments from the sight of the Pa- 
tient. 

And if it be a Child between 
Four and Twelve Years of Age, 
two Servants may hold him by the 
Hands and Feet on each side, whilst 
another getting up upon a little 
Stool, or something plac'd behind 
the Chair, and looking forwards, 
may commodiously lean upon the 
Patient's Shoulders, placing the 
Thumb of each Hand toward his 
Back, and the other Fingers upon 
the Clavicles, for the surer hold, the 
Servant who is on the Right side 
of the Patient, ought to put his Left- 
hand, under and betwixt the Patient's 
Knees, and take fast hold of the 
Wrist of his Right-hand, and that 
the Child be not hurt, the Sleeve 
of his Shirt or Wastcoat may be 
pull'd down to cover his Hand; 
after that, the same Servant with his 
|P_141
Right-hand must lay hold of the 
Leg on the same side by the Foot 
and Ancle. 

The Servant on the Patient's 
Left-hand must do the like, taking 
hold of the Left-Arm of the Pa- 
tient with his Right-Hand, and the 
Left-Leg near to the Foot with his 
Left-Hand. 

In this Posture the Child's Hands 
must almost touch his Heels, and 
if he be but any way held fast and 
if be but any way held fast and 
his Thighs spread wide, the Litho- 
tomist will have Room sufficient to 
Operate, yet because Children do 
sometimes extreamly struggle and 
strive, two other Servants may like- 
wise keep their Knees asunder; but it 
is chiefly to be observ'd in this 
posture, that the Patient lean half 
backwards that his Fundament 
may be seen, and that his Feet do 
not rest upon any thing, so that 
|P_142
he may have the less force to stir 
or move himself. See here the Fi- 
gure of the Posture. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy posture on the following page. ^]
But when Children are very 
Young, the easiest and best way, 
is to place them in a Man's lap to 
have the Operation perform'd; 
for which end the Lithotomist, must 
chuse a Strong Man, and cause him 
to sit upon a prety high common 
Chair, or upon the End of a Bench, 
with his Knees tied together who 
having a large Cushing or Pillow, 
put against his Belly and upon his 
Knees, and a Sheet over it must 
take the Child that is to be Cut up- 
on his Knees, and putting his 
Hands under and betwixt the Childs 
Legs, must take hold of his two 
Wrists, by this means the Child is 
put into a very convenient and 
easie posture to be cut; But 
besides the Man that is to hold 
|P_
|P_
|P_143
the Child, it is requisite that some 
other Person lean upon the Child's 
Shoulders, and another open his 
Knees, and keep his Feet steddy. 

Take here the exact Figure of this 
Posture. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy posture on the previous page. ^]
Yet when a Child is large and 
strong; and considering that the 
Operation is sometimes laborious, 
and that the Man who is to hold 
the Child may be weary, it is 
better to make use of the first 
way. 

|P_144
[}CHAP. XI. }]
[}Of the different ways of extracting the 
Stone, amongst the rest of the Li- 
thotomia Franconiana. }]
GREAT Pain, Inflammation, 
Carnosities, and Callosities do 
sometimes hinder the Lithotomist, 
that he cannot introduce a crooked 
Catheter into the Bladder. Prosper 
Alpinus, in his 3d Book, the 14th 
Chapt. relates several passages of the 
Egyptian Physicians, who (he says) 
extracted Stones out of the very 
Bladder without Cutting, by only di- 
lating the Urethra, Per flatum, or by 
blowing into the Penis. 

They had Pipes of several sizes, 
beginning with very small ones, 
and gradualy introducing larger, 
and thus extending more and more, 
|P_145
till the Passage was wide enough 
to admit the Stone to be extracted 
without Cutting; but to do this in 
Men must be very difficult indeed, 
if ever it was done; however we 
let the Story pass without contra- 
diction, because we have it from 
such Eminent hands. 

Indeed the Urethra in Women 
may be dilated to a strange large- 
ness, and Stones be extracted from 
them without Cutting, as I my self have 
often done; particularly some Years 
since from a young Gentlewoman 
about 17 Years of Age; and of 
late from one Mrs Fowler, in 
Durham-Yard, near Chick-lane, in 
Smithfield, who gave me leave 
to mention her Name and 
whose Urethra I very much di- 
lated and took a Stone from her 
without making any Incision; it is 
not a Year and half since. Both 
these Women I perfectly Cur'd 
|P_146
they having no involuntary Emis- 
sion of Urine, but retain their 
Water as if no Stone had been 
taken from them. 

Via in Mulieribus (as I said be- 
fore) latior est & brevior quam in 
Viris. 

But the method of Petrus Francus, 
(who is call'd by Fabritius Hildanus, 
the most excellent and most ex- 
pert Lithotomist,) is worthy to be 
noted; he first prepared the Body 
of the Patient for some Days, 
which Preparation I have given 
you before, then he made Incision
upon the furrow'd Staffe on the 
Convex part of it, putting a 
hollow Tent-Pipe or Cannula into 
the Wound, for the Urine to run 
through, going no further that 
time, but leaving the Stone in the 
|P_147
Bladder, except it appear'd in the 
Wound, which then he took out, 
either with a pair of Forceps or the 
Hamulus, but if the Stone appear'd 
not in the Wound, or if it was too 
big to be extracted, he left it be- 
hind, dress'd the Wound and laid 
his Patient in Bed: And some 
Days after, when the Patient was 
in a good condition, without a 
Fever, and the Wound began to 
digest, and the Stone appear'd in 
it (as it will do commonly) then 
he took it out; this he informs us 
he has done often with very good 
Success. 

But if the Stone did not ap- 
pear he put his Fingers in Anum, 
and making compression upon the 
Muscles of the Abdomen, forc'd the 
Stone towards the Wound, (which 
he then did without any danger, 
because the Tumour or Inflamma- 
|P_148
tion was gone off, the Urine having 
had its free course, and the Patient 
using and exquisite Diet) and drew 
it out. 

But if the Stone was so big that 
it could not be extracted without 
hurting the Membraneous part of the 
Bladder, he then broke the Stone, 
which such Instruments as Fabr. 
Hildanus describes, P. M. 113. 

The Instrument must be strong, 
and the Teeth of it sharp, and if 
the Stone cannot be broke into 
pieces small enough at one time, 
the use of the Instrument must be 
repeated again two or three Days 
after, till the Stone be so broken 
that the pieces may be brought forth, 
without hurting the Neck of the 
Bladder; in the interium Anodine 
Medicines must be given, and hot 
Fomentations apply'd to keep of an 
Inflammation or Gangrene, he says 
|P_149
thus: Consultius est Calculum frustu- 
latim extrahere, quam ægrum tanto do- 
lore atque miseria opprimi, semperque 
ex duobus malis minimum est eligen- 
dum. 

This Method I never practised; 
but when I was concern'd with 
Mr. George Sutor Deceas'd; we had 
a Patient a French-Man, Mr. James 
Sweet by Name, who liv'd in Ni- 
cholas-street, near Shore-ditch, and 
whom Mr. Sutor Cut on the 24th 
of March 1688, and it happen'd 
that by indeavouring to extract the 
Stone he broke it into many pieces; 
however with my assistance several 
of the pieces were taken out; but 
the Patient bleeding very much, 
and growing faint, it gave me 
reason to fear he would Die under 
our Hands, if we proceeded fur- 
ther, therefore his Wound was 
Dress'd, and he was laid in his 
|P_150
Bed, and continued very Weak a 
great while, and was so bad that 
it was not safe to attempt the ex- 
tracting the remaining pieces of 
the Stone (which did not appear in 
the Wound,) therefore the Wound 
was heal'd up, and in sometime 
his strength recovered; but he felt 
some Pain, tho' not half so much 
with the Fragments of the Stone 
left in his Bladder, as he did be- 
fore it was broke: But in two 
Years after his Pains being great 
he had Courage enough to have 
the Operation perform'd again, 
and I successfully Cut him my 
self, and took out 32 Stones of 
various shapes and pretty large, 
he was then 22 Years of Age, and 
is now alive and well. 

But Petrus Francus had ano- 
ther method of Extracting the 
Stone from the Bladder, which 
|P_151
is call'd the Hypogastric or High Ope- 
ration, He was the first that practis'd 
Lithotomy that way, and gives the 
Reason of his attempting it, when 
he tells us of a Child of Two 
Years Old, who having a Stone in 
the Bladder as big as an Hens Egg 
was brought to him to be Cut: 
He us'd all his Dexterity and In- 
dustry to force the Stone down in- 
to the Neck of the Bladder, but 
found it impossible to be done: 
The poor Child was in that Tor- 
ture and Misery, that the Parents 
wish'd him rather Dead than he 
should live longer in so doleful a 
Condition: Petrus Francus on 
the other hand thinking it would 
tend to his dishonour not to take 
away the Stone, at last resol- 
v'd to make tryal whether he could 
not bring it to the very Groin, 
which he did by putting his Fingers 
|P_152
in Anum, lifting up the Stone, and 
causing one of his Servants on the 
other side opposite to him, to press 
it down to the place intend- 
ed for Incision, which he made, 
took out the Stone, and tho' the 
Child was very weak, recover'd 
him and heal'd the Wound; but 
he admonishes others not to fol- 
low this method of Cutting. 

Una hirundo non facit Ver. 

Yet I once had a Patient in Long- 
Lane in Moorfields, upon whom I 
was oblig'd to perform this high 
Operation, and very successfully 
Extracted the Stone, by making 
Incision near the Groin, the Patient 
soon recovering; which shews 
that Wounds in the Fibrous Parts 
of the Bladder are not always 
Mortal.

[}Of the Apparatus Minor, or Lesser 
Operation for Men and Boys. }]
COrnelius Celsus was the Inventor 
of this Operation, which he 
describes in his 7th Book, Chap. 26. 
it is call'd the lesser Operation be- 
cause it requires fever Instruments: 
When the Patient is fix'd in one of 
the foremention'd Postures the Li- 
thotomist must first depress the lower 
part of the Abdomen or Belly 
of the Patient; that the Stone may 
the better fall to the Neck of the 
Bladder. Then putting one or two 
of his Fingers in Anum, and force- 
ing the Stone to the proper place 
as Art directs, he must make In- 
cision on the Left-side of the Suture
in the Perineum upon the Stone, and 
|P_154
endeavour to cast it forth if it be 
little, with his Finger, which I 
have several times done, but if he 
cannot, he must take it out with the 
Hamulus, and if that can't be done, 
he must remove his Fingers out of 
the Anus, and introduce the Button
into the Wound to search for the 
Stone, and having felt it, must 
conduct a pair of Forceps upon the 
Button to lay hold of it, and gently 
draw it out. 

If the Patient be little, there is 
no need of making him jump, be- 
fore he be Cut, it is enough that he 
be put into a Posture and held by 
the Servants; the Lithotomist must 
have his Nails pair'd, and must not 
always dip his Finger or Fingers in 
Oil, for they being put up dry in- 
to the Intestinum Rectum, will pre- 
vent its being wrinkled or lying 
on the upper part of the Stone, for 
|P_
|P_155
if it should so happen when the 
Incision is made, the Lithotomist
must of necessity Cut the Intestine, 
which the Finger or Fingers 
being put up dry will prevent 
and keep the Intestine in its 
due place, but if the Fingers are 
dipt into Oil, the Intestine may slip 
towards the Stone, and produce 
this great danger: I give only this 
hint to prevent ill consequences, 
but leave every Lithotomist to his 
Liberty: abundans Cautela non nocet. 

In this Operation let a Servant 
lift up the Scrotum with one Hand, 
and with the other armed with a 
Compress lean upon the Belly, to 
make the Stone come down, as it 
is represented in this Figure.
[^An illustration of a lithotomy operation on the previous page. ^]
Note, That before the Lithotomist
makes Incision, he must dry the 
Perineum and stretch the Skin. 

|P_156
The Tumour that the Stone (co- 
ver'd with Teguments) makes, ren- 
ders the Incision on the side of the 
Suture easie, and which may be 
made long enough for extracting 
of the Stone; the Lithotomist must 
not fear the spoiling of the Edge 
or Point of the Bistori or Knife, 
for every time its is to be us'd it 
must be set again: When then In- 
cision is made, the Fingers must not 
be drawn out of the Intestinum Re- 
ctum; but keeping them in, the Hamu- 
lus must be put into the Wound and 
slip'd between the Pubes and the 
Stone. As desribed in this Fi- 
gure. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy operation on the following page. ^]
By what Operation soever a Li- 
thotomist Cuts a Patient; when a 
Stone breaks, he must with his 
Fingers in Ano, keep the fragments 
forward to the Wound, and take 
them out with the Scoope or Hamulus, 
|P_
|P_157
and also search with the Button af- 
terwards least any Pieces should be 
left behind, and if any are felt, 
they must be extracted with the 
Forceps as before taught. 

If the Patient has been Cut for 
the Stone before, then the Incision
must be made upon the Cicatrice or 
Fistula: In my Practice I have Cut
Seven Patients, who had undergone 
the Operation before, and they all 
recovered, one of them had been 
Cut twice before, and lives still in 
Watling-street, and is very well. 

[}CHAP. XIII. }]
[}Of the Lesser and Greater Operation
for Women and Maids. }]
THE Lithotomist must thrust 
the first Finger (called Digi- 
tus Index) of his Right-Hand into 
the Vaginam Uteri in Women, in- 
clining the Finger upwards to the 
Os Pubis, and with his Left-Hand 
must press the Belly downwards, 
and if there be a Stone in the Blad- 
der he will find it; otherways he 
may search with the Womens Ca- 
theter introducing it into the Ure- 
thra and moving it forwards and 
backwards, up and down, on the 
Right and Left, and thus he will 
find the Stone or Stones if any 
there be; but if the Patient is very 
|P_159
Young the Lithotomist must search 
digito in anum Immisso, as you search 
little Boys. 

When the Lithotomist is to exrtact
the Stone, he must make use of the 
hollow strait Catheter, which being 
introduc'd into the Urethra must 
be held by a Servant, and the Ori- 
fice of the Urethra must be Dilated
by a Simple Dilatatory, conducted 
in the Cavity of the Catheter: The 
Orifice must not be dilated too much 
forward, because the passage being 
short, if the Fibres are delacerated, 
it may cause an involuntary emis- 
sion of the Urine; the Dilatation
being made, the Catheter must be 
taken out with the Dilatatory, and 
the Fingers being still in the same 
place, into which they were intro- 
duced, the Stone must by them be 
kept forward and be drawn out 
with the Hamulus, or with the For- 
|P_160
-ceps, in the same manner as from 
Little Boys. 

But Young-Women and Girls 
may be excus'd from the Violence 
which they suffer by this Lesser 
Operation, because the Great Opera- 
tion is more convenient, and is thus 
perform'd; the Patient (if very 
Young) must be plac'd upon a 
strongs Man's Knees (as before de- 
scrib'd for Little Boys) and being 
held in a convenient Posture, the 
Conductor, which is shaped like a 
Sword, and has a Bill, must be 
introduc'd into the Urethra, and 
then a small Dilatatory; and having 
made a moderate Dilatation, while 
the Dilatatory is still open, the Litho- 
tomist according to his own discre- 
tion and the bigness of the Stone, 
may make a small Incision to the 
Right and Left of the External 
Orifice of the Passage, then drawing 
|P_161
out the Dilatatory, and introducing 
the Forceps along the Conductor must 
take hold of the Stone, and ex- 
tract it in the usual manner. But 
strong Women must be plac'd in 
the same Posture to have this Oper- 
ation perform'd, that Men are, which 
Posture we shall describe in the fol- 
lowing Chapter; it is scarce credible 
how much the Urethra may be Dilated
both in Men and Women: I have 
taken away from a Virgin of Six- 
teen Years of Age, a Triangular 
Stone of the bigness of an Egg, 
if we may imagine it of that shape, 
by only Dilating the Urethra without 
Cutting or in the least tearing it; 
and by applying ordinary means, 
in Three Weeks she was sound and 
firm, holding ger Water as well as 
ever. 

|P_162
There are some Lithotomists who 
having introduc'd the strait hollow 
Catheter, thrust in also the Conductor
shap'd like a Sword; and then the 
Catheter being drawn out, they ea- 
sily slip in the other forked Con- 
ductor, because the first has a Line 
that directs the second; and be- 
tween these two Conductors which 
they press betwixt the Fore-finger 
and Middle-finger of the Left- 
Hand, they thrust in the For- 
ceps to continue the Operation and 
take out the Stone. And thus the 
Great Operation is much easier per- 
form'd in Women and with abun- 
dance less Danger than in Men. 

|P_163
[}CHAP. XIV. }]
[}Of the Apparatus Major, or Great 
Operation in Men and Boys. }]
JOanes de Romanis a Physician of 
Cremona, in the Year 1520, in- 
vented and practis'd at Rome, the 
great Operation, so called, because 
it requires more Instruments than 
other methods do. 

Men who are Cut by the great 
Operation occasion a great deal more 
trouble then Women, not only in 
respect to the Operation it self, but 
likewise in respect to the Cure; be- 
cause their Urethra is much more 
crooked, long, and narrow, and 
their way of Living renders that 
part many times subject to more 
|P_164
Diseases than those Parts in Wo- 
men. 

When the Patient is prepar'd 
and ready, he must be set upon 
the Chair or a Table of an indiffe- 
rent length, his Buttocks a little 
rais'd, and his Head and Body in- 
clining backwards, and leaning 
upon the back of a common Chair 
reversed; and that the Patient may 
continue fix'd in a good Posture, 
two Scarffs must be made use of 
in this manner; having laid them 
long ways, they must be tied 
both together by a Knot in the 
middle, so that the ends of the 
Scarffs being extended may ap- 
pear like a Cross, and then they 
must be put about the Patient's 
Neck, (if they be too long, they 
may be short'ned by tying a- 
nother Knot,) the Knot and 
a Noose made in the same 
|P_165
Scarffs must hand down behind. 
This being done, the Lithotomist
taking two ends of the Scarffs on 
the right side, and a Servant the 
other two ends on the Left-side 
both of them standing before the 
Patient, and making him set his 
feet against them, the Lithotomist
and his Servant each on his side 
must bring one of the ends of 
the Scarffs before, upon the Cla- 
vicles and another end be- 
hind upon the Shoulder-Blades, 
and then bringing them cross- 
ways under the Armpits, they 
must twist them together, giving 
them two or three turns; after 
which they must bring the Patient's 
Knees as near as they can to his 
Belly, and at the same time bring 
one end of the Scarffs on the inside 
of his Knees, and another on the 
outside of them, and join them 
|P_166
both together underneath, giving 
them a cast over one another; 
then also the Patients Heels must 
be raised near to his Buttocks, that 
his Legs may be tied in the same 
manner; and after that, causing him 
to put his Four Fingers of each Hand 
under the Souls of his Feet, and 
his Thumbs below the External 
Anckle-bones, as if he were to 
take hold of his Heels, they 
must tye the Wrist and Hand to 
the Leg and Foot on each side, 
bringing the ends of the Scarffs
under the Feet like Stirrops, and 
drawing them betwixt the Feet and 
the Thumbs, because the Ligatures
being to be made indifferently strait, 
they would hurt the Thumbs, if 
they were ty'd upon them, to 
which the Patient's struglings would 
not a little contribute. See here the 
exact Figure of the Posture and Swa- 
things.
[^An illustration of a lithotomy posture on the following page. ^]
|P_
|P_167
This posture is somewhat ter- 
rible to the Patient, and therefore 
since there are some Men of a 
strong Resolution and invincible 
Courage, if they be unwilling to 
suffer these Ligatures; it will be 
sufficient to bind their Thighs and 
Legs only in the manner describ'd, 
causing their Arms to be held by 
two Men; or perhaps they may 
like it better to have their Hands
tied together, for which end laying 
their Wrists one upon another, they 
must be ty'd together with the 
middle of a Band wrapp'd two or 
three times about them, and then 
two indifferent hard Knots, being 
cast the two ends of the Band must 
be brought about the Neck and 
ty'd, together with a slip Knot, so 
that the Patient's Hands may rest 
about the Pit of the Stomach or 
the Cartilago Ensiformis. 

|P_168
Whilst this Apparatus is making, 
it is fit the Lithotomist should speak 
to the Patient, but not in many 
words, that he look upon him and 
incourage him with discourse, shun- 
ning every thing that is undecent, 
and obliging those that are present to 
be silent and attentive, which com- 
forts a Patient wonderfully; calling 
to mind that to make light of the 
Disease, the Infirmity or Expressions 
of a Patient, is no better than to 
insult over a Man in Affliction. 

It is always best to have few 
Spectators, and those such as are 
necessary to help; a great many 
may incommode the Lithotomist, 
frighten the Patient, and put a 
bad Construction on the Accidents 
that sometimes accompany the 
Operation. 

|P_
|P_169
When the Patient is seated, the 
Lithotomist must place his People to 
support him, spread open his Knees, 
lean upon his Shoulders, and to 
lift up the Scrotum, a Servant must 
be at the Right-Hand of the Litho- 
tomist to hold the Bistory, ready for 
him to take it, when there is oc- 
casion, but must hide the Blade in 
his Hand, as here represented. 
[^An illustration of a hand and a scalpel on the previous page. ^]
The Servants are plac'd in the same 
manner for the Lesser as for the 
Great Operation; but they hold the 
Patient in a different manner, as 
it has been represented by the 
Figures. 

When there is a Hernia or Burst- 
ness, the Scrotum is to be lifted up 
very high, and care is to be taken 
in making the Incision not to hurt 
the Testicles, nor the Parts affected 
by the Hernia. 

|P_170
Before the Operation there is some- 
times a Procidentia or falling of the 
Anus, occasioend by the straining 
of the Patient: If the falling be 
considerable, the Lithotomist may 
thrust it up without Violence, 
and then lay a Bolster upon the Anus, 
which a Servant is to press hard: 
But if the Servant's Hand hinders 
the Operator, there must nothing be 
put to the Rectum, for after the Ope- 
ration is over it is easily reduced, and 
in all my Practice it never return'd 
again, using Stiptick Fomentations, 
&c. 

If the Patient has been Cut be- 
fore, (as already mentioned) the In- 
cision is to be made upon the Cica- 
trice, taking heed not to cut the 
Suture, because it does not so easily 
Cicatrise, and is also attended by 
many Accidents. 

|P_171
The Incision in Children is at least 
made Two Fingers breadth long; 
in Men Three or Four Fingers breadth 
or there abouts according to the big- 
ness of the Stone, and circumstances 
of the Patient. It ought not to be 
too large, for when the Stone is in 
the passage, if the Incision happen to 
prove too small, it may easily be in- 
larg'd with the Bistory, or a pair of 
Probe-Scissars. 

The Incision of the Skin and Mem- 
branes is easily made, but many times 
the Urethra is not sufficiently opened 
unless one press the Bistory hard in 
the furrow of the Staff. 

Incision is never made in the Neck
of the Bladder, but always in the U- 
rethra, and Experience convinces that 
a great Incision in the Operation is as 
soon Cicatris'd as a small one. 

The Patient being set in a posture 
and bound with the Scarffs, his Arms
|P_172
and Legs held by two Strong Men, 
and if need be two others to keep his 
Knees asunder, and one placed be- 
hind the Chair or Table to press upon 
his Shoulders, Lithotomy must then 
be performed, if possible by the 
Lesser Operation before taught, or 
at least by this Great, introducing 
the furrowed Catheter, with which 
the Lithotomist first searches, and 
is certain if there be a Stone or not. 

N. B. If nothing be felt with the 
furrowed Catheter, it is necessary to 
introduce a hollow Catheter that has 
a shorther Bill, making the Patient 
void his Urine thro' it, and if there 
be a Stone it will by that means be 
more easily found, because when it 
floats, it will follow the course of 
the Urine; the Bill of the Catheter
also being short will turn better in 
the Bladder. When the Stone is 
found, the furrow'd Catheter is again 
to be introduced. 

|P_173
If the Patient has been Cut before, 
it is harder to introduce the Catheter, 
and therefore one is to be taken of a 
size that would suit with a younger 
Subject, and sufficiently long, ac- 
cording to the Age of him that is 
to be searched. There are some Li- 
thotomists who hold the Catheter them- 
selves when they make the Incision:
Others cause a Servant to hold it, 
who is placed at the side of the Chair, 
opposite to the Part where the Litho- 
tomist is to make the Incision; for Ex- 
ample, the Lithotomist performing his 
Operation on the left side of the Suture, 
the Servant must be on the Patient's 
Right-Hand, and having wiped and 
dried the Scrotum and Perineum, he 
must lift up the Scrotum with his Left- 
Hand, and rest his other Hand 
upon the Rings and end of the Ca- 
theter, inclining the furrowing a little 
to the Patient's left side, but must 
|P_174
take care not to make it come out of 
the Bladder, which he may avoid if 
he bring not the Rings of the Catheter
too near the Belly. 

The Lithotomist ought to mind first 
that the Servant holds it right, bid- 
ding him hold it fast and not waver, 
and causing others to lean upon the 
Patient's Shoulders, because at that 
very time the Lithotomist ought to pull 
the Suture toward the Right-side, 
placing the Thumb of his Left-hand 
near the Anus, and his other near the 
Scrotum, and having felt with the 
Fore-Finger of the Right-hand, and 
observed the place where the back of 
the Catheter is, in the same manner as 
one does to find the Vein before 
Blood-letting (as represented here in the 
Figure) and pulling still the Suture
to the Right, with his Right-hand he 
must take the mounted Bistori from 
a Servant, and in making the Incision
|P_
|P_175
he is to search for the furrowing of 
the Catheter, into which he is to thrust 
the point of the Bistory, and then 
press hard, above towards the Scrotum
and below, sinking the Wrist, that 
the point of the Bistory may be al- 
ways directed into furrowing un- 
derneath the Catheter, that the Ure- 
thra may be exactly Cut, avoiding 
the Scrotum, the Rectum, and the 
Hemmerrhoide Veins; then he must re- 
turn the Bistory to a Servant, and 
take the Conductor and introduce 
it into the furrowing; after which, 
with the Left-hand he must lay 
hold on the Catheter, by the end 
which the Servant held. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy posture on the following page. ^]
To prevent the Fingers of the Li- 
thotomist's Left-hand from sliding du- 
ring the time of the Incision, he may 
make use of a very narrow Compress
to help him to press and pull the 
Suture towards the Patient's Right- 
side. 

|P_176
If in making Incision the Lithotomist
himself hold the Catheter, the Ser- 
vant who extends the Perineum may 
upon the same account put very 
narrow Compresses betwixt his Fingers 
and the Patient's Skin, that so he 
may hold the two sides of the Su- 
ture firmer towards the Thighs; by 
that means the Humidity will not 
hinder him to press upon them as 
much as is necessary. 

I remember Monsieur Collot who's 
several Operations I have seen both at 
Amsterdam about 40 Years ago, and 
here in London, about 33 Years since, 
performed the Operation in this fol- 
lowing manner. 

After he had introduc'd the Ca- 
theter, and was sure of the Stone, 
he caus'd a Servant plac'd on the 
Patient's Right-side to lift up the 
Scrotum, and having dried the Parts 
that were wet, the same Servant hold- 
|P_
|P_177
ing his Hands almost open, with 
his Right-Hand pull'd the Suture;
to the Right-side, and with his o- 
ther Hand, the Skin to the Left, 
resting his Hands towards the Pa- 
tient's Groins, so that they lifted 
or kept up the Scrotum at the same 
time; and then that Ingenious Li- 
thotomist inclin'd the Catheter a lit- 
tle towards the Belly, and with his 
Left-hand press'd upon the Rings, 
whilst with his Right-Fore-finger he 
mark'd the place of Incision; then 
was the Bistory or the Knife present- 
ed to him, and during the time, 
that the Servant held the Perineum
stretch'd to the Right and Left, 
without the use of the Compresses he 
made the Incision as others do. 

Take this for the Figure of it. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy posture on the previous page. ^]
The Servant may also with one 
Hand lift up the Scrotum, whilst 
|P_178
with the other that is extended he 
presses hard upon the Perineum, 
holding between Two Fingers the 
place where the Lithotomist intends 
make the Incision. Otherwise the 
Servant may hide his two Thumbs 
in his Hands, and with his two 
Fore-fingers extend the Perineum for 
the same purpose. 

The furrowing of the Catheter
being discovered, and the Bistory
return'd; Monsieur Collot took a 
Conductor with an Elbow towards 
the middle, (and which is com- 
posed of two Branches) and thrust 
the Bill of it into the furrowing 
of the Catheter, and when the Con- 
ductor was introduc'd into the Blad- 
der, he drew out the Catheter, and 
conveigh'd his Forceps betwixt the 
Branches of the Conductor, to introduce 
'em into the Bladder: And then the 
|P_179
Conductor being taken out, he con- 
tinu'd the Operation. 

These two ways are very good, 
and have both their advantages, 
for when the Lithotomist himself 
holds the Catheter, he is sure what 
place it is in; yet after the In- 
cision, it is sometimes hard to find 
the furrowing because of Fat, Mem- 
branes and Blood, that hide it; 
it is true that after Incision, the 
point of the Bistory may be left in 
the furrowing, and may be held 
by a Servant whilst the Lithotomist
slides the Bill of the Conductor along 
the Bistory, but when a Servant 
hold the Catheter, after that the 
Incision is made, and that the Litho- 
tomist hath given back the Bistory, 
as we have just now describ'd, he 
may put the Nail of his Left- 
Thumb into the Wound, and ha- 
ving found the slit or furrowing of 
|P_181
tive Mind, and not talk (remem- 
bring that all questions put to him 
at that time are impertinent) and 
then having passed the Bill of the 
Conductor into the furrowing of the 
Catheter, he must hold them fast, 
and be sure to keep the Bill of the 
Conductor always in, sliding it along 
and under the furrowing, and thrust- 
ing upwards; by which means it will 
be certainly introduc'd into the 
Bladder; and then holding it with 
his Right Hand, the Catheter must 
be disingaged from the Conductor, 
(by turning it to the Left) and 
gently drawn out of the Penis. A 
certain sign that the Conductor is in 
Bladder, is the Emission of Urine 
(if there be any in the Bladder) 
along the Conductor. When the 
Conductor is in the Bladder, and the 
Catheter drawn out, it must be held 
with the Left-hand, and a convenient 
|P_182
pair of Forceps be thrust along the 
same Conductor with the Right- 
Hand, as this Figure shews. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy operation on the following page. ^]
Tho' the Conductor be put into 
the Bladder, yet it may be forced 
out again by the Patients strugling, 
which must be prevented, by causing 
some to press upon his Shoulders, 
and others to hold him fast by the 
Hands and Feet, the Lithotomist
in the mean time, holding the Con- 
ductor fast with his Left-hand, must 
not forget taking great notice, whe- 
ther any part of it which he has 
introduc'd, come out again; for if 
he perceive it does, he must not 
thrust it forwards, to make it enter 
again, least a space be made be- 
tween the Bladder and the Rectum, 
nor yet wholly draw it out, be- 
cause perhaps it may still be in 
the Bladder; but taking a pair of 
Forceps of an indifferent size, ra- 
|P_
|P_
|P_183
ther small than great, he must pass 
them along the Conductor without 
forcing, and if he finds any re- 
sistance, the Conductor must be drawn 
out; after which it cannot but 
with difficulty open the Forceps, he 
may be sure that they are not in 
the Bladder, and then without 
speaking, they must be taken out, 
and the Lithotomist must take the 
Button with his Right-hand, and 
lifting up the Scrotum with his Left, 
must pass it into the Wound, turn- 
ing it towards the Penis, and con- 
ducting it upwards to the Bladder, 
as this Figure sheweth. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy operation on the previous page. ^]
The Button being blunt, hurts 
not the Parts in passing, and when 
it is in the Bladder (which may 
be known, by its being easily to be 
turned every way) the Stone 
is softly to be search'd for, by gen- 
ly jogging and moving the Instru- 
|P_184
ment; and when it is felt, the 
Lithotomist must take the Button in 
his Left-hand, and conduct the 
Forceps with his Right, close upon 
the Button into the Bladder, See 
here the Figure of it. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy operation on the following page. ^]
If a crooked pair of Forceps be 
introduc'd, the Bill being turned 
towards the Penis, the Rings or 
Handle must be rais'd more than 
if the Forceps were strait, as may 
be observed by the Difference of 
this Figure from that of Page 182 a- 
foregoing, which represents the strait 
Forceps introduced upon the Con- 
ductor, with the Right-hand bend- 
ing lower and nearer the left. 

The crooked Forceps are made use 
of, when the Stone is thought to 
incline near to the Groin; but 
most commonly the strait Forceps
are sufficient, and both the one 
|P_
|P_185
and the other ought to be laid upon 
the Line of the Button, so as to 
touch on both sides. 

When the Forceps are in the 
Bladder, they must be open'd to 
dilate the Passage, and then having 
joined the Rings almost together, 
they must be gently turn'd and 
mov'd every way (without closing 
the Teeth, for fear of offending 
some part of the Bladder) to search 
for the Stone; when the Operation is 
so far perform'd, the Patient's Thighs
may be brought a little nearer to- 
gether, and not be kept at such a di- 
stance as they were before. 

It is to be observed, that as often 
as one would change the Forceps or 
introduce them, there is a necessity 
of making use of the Button, ex- 
cept when the Conductor is intro- 
duced immediately after the Incision
is made, as before taught. 

|P_186
But if after the Conductor is drawn 
back, the Lithotomist cannot in- 
troduce the Button, it will be ne- 
cessary to take the same furrowed 
Catheter, or one somewhat smaller 
or less, and introduce it gently into 
the Urethra again, without turning 
of it any way, lest it should come 
out at the Incision, and when it is 
passed into the Bladder, the fur- 
rowing of it must be searched for, 
with the Bill of the Conductor thro' 
the Wound, that so the Operation
may be more successfully continu- 
ed than before. 

When the Conductor is in the 
Bladder, if it be fear'd that the 
passage is not wide enough, a 
close Dilatatory must be introduced 
along and upon the Conductor, and 
without turning it any way, only 
bringing the Branches of the handle 
nearer to one another, the bottom 
|P_
|P_187
of the Incision will be dilated in 
length, as much or as little as it is 
thought fit, in this manner. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy operation on the previous page. ^]
This Dilatatory is never us'd un- 
less necessity require it, and after 
it is taken out, the Conductor being 
left in, the Lithotomist must take a 
close pair of Forceps, and slide them 
into the Bladder to search for the 
Stone, as before. 

And if the Stone is not readily 
felt, the Forceps must be mov'd 
gently to the Right and Left, up 
and down, near the Sphincter of the 
Rectum, and sometimes must be 
turned so that one of the Rings
may be higher than the other, 
thereby endeavouring to lay hold 
of the Stone, which may be flat, 
or lye hid at one side of the Blad- 
der; and when it is found, the 
Forceps must be opened with both 
|P_188
Hands, to gripe and lay hold of it. 
The Lithotomist is sometimes so 
fortunate, as to take good hold of 
the Stone in a small time; it is 
easily known whether the Stone is 
in the Forceps or not, because if it 
is, the Rings cannot be made to 
meet again, and some hard Matter
will be felt betwixt the Teeth: 
This is the surest sign, for very 
small Stones may be taken hold of, 
about the middle of the Forceps, 
where they are most bent, without 
hindering the Rings from meeting 
together, but still some hardness 
will be felt: In the Year 1684 as 
I was performing the Lithotomical 
Operation upon one Mr. Francis 
Waldegrove in Suffolk, Aged 45, it 
hap'ned, that having fix'd one large 
Stone in the Teeth of the Forceps, 
and drawing the Forceps towards 
me near the Wound (as I com- 
|P_189
monly do, because if the Stone shou'd 
happen to break, I might then pre- 
vent the Fragments returning into 
the Cavity of the Bladder again) 
having my two Fingers in Ano, I 
felt another small Stone which I 
forced also into the Forceps near the 
middle, and thus extracted both 
Stones at once from my Patient, 
who is still alive and well known 
among the Quakers. 

I also took two Stones from Cap- 
tain Williams, Keeper of the Goal in 
Warwick, on the 19th of September
1698; I extracted the biggest first, 
and the least afterward, taking hold 
of it with the middle of the Forceps; 
he is now alive and well. 

When the Stone is laid hold of, 
the Lithotomist must not at first 
pull towards him, but turn the 
Forceps gently to the Right and 
Left, (holding them with one or 
|P_190
both Hands, according to his con- 
veniency) that so he may know 
if the Stone lye right in the Teeth, 
and disintangle it from among the 
Plicatures of the Bladder, after 
which, he must draw it towards 
him, but without Violence: Be- 
fore 'tis drawn out, the Rings of 
the Forceps must be rais'd and 
lower'd alternately, to make the 
Stone slide with greater ease. If 
the crooked Forceps are us'd, the Bill
of them must be turn'd towards the 
Pubes just at the Passage of bringing 
it out, and the Rings be very near 
the Penis; and that one may not be 
mistaken and turn the Bill downwards, 
it would be necessary to put a mark 
upon one of the Rings of the Forceps. 

When the Stone is in the Forceps, 
especial care is to be had, not to 
turn it quite round, because if the 
Stone be big or uneven, it will 
|P_191
much Contuse the parts of the Blad- 
der: If the Stone be soft, it breaks 
and moulders, and the Forceps easily 
shut, but yet one feels as it were a 
heap of Sand, and then the Rings 
are not to be brought wholly to- 
gether, because there would but a 
small matter of Gravel be drawn 
out, and the parts of the Bladder 
might be hurt. 

The Forceps with what is be- 
twixt the Teeth, must be drawn 
out, and this is to be reiterated, 
conducting the Forceps upon the 
Button, as often as shall be judged 
necessary; and then a Tent or 
Pipe is to be introduced, as shall 
be shew'd in the following Chap- 
ter. 

When the Lithotomist judges the 
Stone to be flat, and of the shape 
of an Almond, he may endeavour 
to make one of the Teeth of the 
|P_192
Forceps slide under it, and the o- 
ther above; though commonly the 
Stones are taken side-ways, and 
when it is taken hold of, he is to 
turn the Forceps again, so that the 
thickness of the Stone may an- 
swer to the length of the Incision. 

Sometimes a Stone of the shape 
of a large Hens Egg, is taken hold 
of by its two ends, which may 
be guess'd by the great distance 
then is observed to be betwixt the 
Rings of the Forceps, nay one 
may see it when the Stone is 
near the Passage; and then the 
Forceps must be thrust back into 
the Bladder, and be a little open'd 
that the Stone may lie loose in 'em, 
and then it will turn without fail, 
and may be held fast by its thick- 
ness side-ways, and thereby the 
Passage will be less dilated in 
drawing it out: If the Lithotomist
|P_193
can't hold the Forceps fast enough 
he may wrap the Rings in a 
Napkin that his Hands may not 
slip. 

If the Stone adheres and sticks 
very close, it is better to delay Ex- 
tracting it for some time, because 
Suppuration contributes to the Sepa- 
ration thereof. 

When it is excessively big, it is 
better to let it alone than to Expose
the Patient to evident Death, es- 
pecially if Age and other Circum- 
stances are contrary to the Ope- 
ration. 

Fabritius Hildanus, in his Treatise 
de Lithotomia Vesicæ, P. M. 114 has 
some Figures (which he borrow'd 
of Petrus Francus) of Forceps that are 
very convenient to break the Stone 
when it is too large to be extract- 
ed; and Beverovicius, my Country- 
man, advises to break a great Stone 
|P_194
with Forceps, whose Teeth resem- 
ble the Teeth of a great Saw. 
The foremention'd Hildanus, when 
he did not break the Stone, made 
use of a long Silver Tent or Pipe, 
perforated and open at the end, 
to hinder the Stone from falling on 
the Sphincter, that so the Patient 
might make Water. 

When all the Stones have been 
Extracted in an Operation, it is not 
needful to introduce a Tent or Pipe: 
Nevertheless there are some Litho- 
tomist, who always use them to 
void Clots of congealed Blood. 
I do not use them because Blood 
will make its way per Penem, or 
by the Wound: But a Tent may 
sometimes be useful, when there 
is an Ulcer in the Bladder, that In- 
jections may be the more conveni- 
ently made into it. 

|P_195
[}CHAP. XV. }]
[}Of the Difficulties happening in this 
Operation. }]
AN Operation is call'd hard and 
laborious, when by a skill- 
ful Man it is not perform'd in a 
short time. In such a case the Pa- 
tient is not to be held in Pain un- 
til the Stone or all its parts be ex- 
tracted. Sometimes it so stops the 
Passage, that the Conductor or For- 
ceps cannot enter without great 
difficulty; and therefore an Ex- 
pert Lithotomist must no scruple to 
take out his Instruments, and with 
the Button or his Finger thrust back 
the Stone into the Bladder; and 
afterwards make use of the Button
|P_196
and Forceps to continue the Opera- 
tion. 

It many times happens, that after 
the Stone hath been laid hold 
of, it escapes and mounts up a- 
gain, because the Forceps give way, 
or the Teeth are not good, or the 
Stone is monst'rous in respect to 
the Passage, or breaks when it is 
held too strait, or because it so adheres 
to the Bladder, that it cannot be 
easily Extracted. 

These Circumstances are to be 
observ'd very exactly, and the Li- 
thotomist ought not to be more care- 
ful in Operating, than in consider- 
ing the Strength and Age of 
the Patient, with the time that 
he has been under the Operation, 
keeping him rather too short a 
time than too long, lest the Pa- 
tient being made to endure too 
much be surpriz'd by Death: 
|P_
|P_197
But if, after the Operation hath been 
methodically carried on, nothing is 
Extracted; because there was no 
Stone in the Bladder, or that the 
Stone is small, or if Fragments re- 
main, he may take the Button
with a Scoop, by the small or middle, 
and introduce the Scoop or Spoon
into the Wound, and so endeavour 
to Extract whatever he finds, and 
this having been two or three times 
reiterated, he ought to make use 
of a Cannula proportionable to the 
Subject, and mounted according 
to Art. 

For introducing it, he may make 
use of the Button, put into the In- 
cision, and having dipp'd the end of 
the Cannula, or Tent, in Oyl, he may 
conduct it along the Button even to 
the Bladder, in this manner. 
[^An illustration of a lithotomy operation on the previous page. ^]
|P_198
The ends of the piece of Lin- 
nen wherewith the Tent is mounted, 
may be ty'd to the Girdle that is 
made with the Bandage, one before, 
and the other behind. Next Day 
or some Days after, the Tent is to 
be taken out, and if there remain 
still somewhat in the Bladder, the 
Lithotomist must endeavour with the 
Hamulus or Hook, or with the Scoop
of the Button, or with the Forceps
conducted by the Button, to extract 
it while the Patient lies a Bed; or 
otherwise, he may be placed upon 
a Servan't Lap, or upon a Table 
as at first, yet without using of 
Ligatures or Scarfs, because then the 
Patient being weak, it would put 
him into too great fear. 

When the Fragments are but mo- 
derately big, they may be Extract- 
ed a Bed; the Tent must be left in, 
until the Lithotomist is certain, that 
|P_199
there is nothing more remaining 
to be Extracted, which may be 
known, if he observes what came 
out during the Operation, or after- 
wards with the Medicines.
