[}the 
Complete Family-Piece: 
and 
Country Gentleman and Farmer's 
BEST GUIDE, &c.}]
[}CHAP. I. }]
[}Containing a great Number of Receipts in 
Physick and Surgery. }]
[}An excellent Remedy to enrich the Blood. }]
TAKE Garden and Sea Scurvy-grass, Sage, 
Brooklime, and Water-Cresses, of each 
three Handfuls, the Juice of one Seville
Orange; mix all together, and when 
stamped and strained, take half a Quarter 
of a Pint of the Juice, with half an Ounce 
of Horse-Radish Water, every Morning and Night. 

[}For a Pleurisy, if the Person cannot be blooded. }]
Take of the Seeds or Leaves of Carduus, a large 
Handful; boil them in a Pint of Beer till Half is con- 
sumed; then strain it, and give it warm to the Party. 
|P_2
They must be fasting when they take it, and fast six 
Hours after it, or it will do them Harm. 

[}A very effectual Remedy for the Piles. }]
Take Black-lead scrap'd fine, mix it with some Ho- 
ney, till the Honey looks black; then put it into an 
Oyster-shell, and set it over the Fire till it grows so stiff, 
that you can make it into a Suppository. 

[}An excellent Remedy to bring away the Gravel. }]
Take a Quart of Spring-water, and put a Toast in 
it; when the Toast has soak'd for some Time, take it 
out, and sweeten the Water very sweet with good clear 
Honey, and drink as much as you can of it every Morn- 
ing, which will make the Passages so glib and slippery, 
as to bring away all gravelly or sandy Matter. 

[}A Poultice for a Sore Breast, Leg, or Arm. }]
Boil Wheat-flower very well in strong Ale, and pretty 
thick, then take it off and scrape in some Boar's Grease; 
let it not boil after the Grease is in, stir it well, and 
apply it hot. 

[}For a Canker in the Mouth. }]
Take the Leaves of Woodbind, Briar, Columbine, 
Red Sage, Sorrel and Violet Leaves, of each one Hand- 
ful, and two or three Sprigs of Rue; stamp them, strain 
the Juice, and boil it with four Ounces of Honey, and 
put in a Bit of Allum, the Quantity of a Wallnut, scum 
it clean, and wash the Mouth often with it. 

[}To create a good Appetite, and strengthen the Stomach. }]
Take of the Stomatick-Pill with Gums, Extractum 
Rudii, of each a Dram; Resin of Jalap, half a Scruple; 
Oil of Anniseeds, 4 Drops; Tartar vitriolated, 1 Scru- 
ple; mix with Syrup of Violets, and make into Pills; 
of which take Four or Five over Night. They are of 
excellent Use in the Megrims, and Vertigo, by reason 
they carry the Humour off from the Stomach, which 
fumes up into the Head. 

|P_3
[}For a Stitch in the Side. }]
Take a large Acorn dry'd and powder'd, and Powder 
of Angelica-seed, of each a like Quantity; drink after 
it a Glass of Black Cherry Water. 

[}A Remedy for an Asthma. }]
Take Castor one Dram, Salt of Steel half a Dram; 
made into very small Pills, with Extract of Rue. These 
you may take every Hour till the Convulsion is abated, 
drinking three Spoonfuls of the following Julep after 
each Dose.— Take of Black-cherry and Penny- 
royal Water, each an Ounce; of Rue and compound 
Briony-Water, each 4 Ounces, with a small Quantity 
of Sugar, made into a Julep.—Or a Toad dried and 
powder'd, made into Pills, and taken as above, is a 
most excellent Remedy, notwithstanding the common 
Opinion of the great Poison there is in Toads. 

[}For the Whites, or any Flux. }]
Take Venice Treacle and candid Ginger, of each 3 
Drams, half an Ounce of Diascordium; of Red Coral, 
Dragon's Blood, and Pomegranat-peel, of each 2 Drams; 
Crocus Martis astringent, 1 Dram; make it into a soft 
Electuary with Syrup of Coral; of which give the 
Quantity of a Nutmeg every Morning, at Five in the 
Afternoon, and the last thing at Night, drinking after 
it six Spoonfuls of the Infusion of Red Roses made acid 
with Spirit of Vitriol. It will be necessary to purge 
twice or thrice before you take the Electuary. 

[}To prevent After-pains. }]
Take nine single Piony-seeds powder'd, the same 
Quantity of Powder of Borax, and a little Nutmeg; 
mix all these with a little white Anniseed-water in a 
Spoon, and give it the Woman; and after it, as soon 
as possible after she is laid in Bed, a little Anniseed- 
water. 

[}For a Looseness, or Bloody Flux. }]
Take the Yolks of two new-laid Eggs, and put them 
into a Glass of strong Cinnamon-water, and drink it all; 
|P_4
Brandy, Rum, Rosa-solis, or indeed any strong spiri- 
tuous Liquor, will do as well as Cinnamon-water, and 
does very seldom fail. But this should never be used, 
but in the greatest Extremity; because chewing of Rhu- 
bard is as certain, and carries off the Cause; and of all 
the sudden Cures I prefer Venice Treacle. 

[}Professors Boerhaave and Osterdyke's Regimen prescribed 
for the Gout. }]
They are of Opinion that the Gout is not to be cured 
by any other Means but by a Milk-Diet, which will in 
twelve Months time alter the whole Mass of Blood; and, 
in order thereto, the following Directions must be strict- 
ly observ'd and follow'd: 

I. You must not taste any Liquor, only a Mixture of 
one Third Milk, and two Thirds Water, your Milk as new 
as you can get it, and to drink it as often as you have Oc- 
casion for it, without adding any other to it. A little 
Tea and Coffee is likewise permitted, with Milk. 

II. In a Morning as soon as awake, and the Stomach 
has made a Digestion, you must drink eight Ounces of 
Spring-Water, and fast two Hours after; then eat Milk 
and Bread, Milk-Pottage, or Tea with Milk, with a 
little Bread and fresh Butter. 

III. At Dinner you must not eat any thing but what 
is made of Barley, Oats, Rice, or Millet Seed, Carrots, 
Potatoes, Turnips, Spinage, Beans, Pease, &c. You 
may likewise eat Fruit when full ripe, baked Pears or 
Apples, Apple-Dumplings, but above all, Milk and 
Bisket is very good, but nothing salt or sour, not even 
a Seville Orange. 

IV. At Supper you must eat nothing but Milk and 
Bread. 

V. It is necessary to go to Bed betimes, even before 
Nine o'Clock, to accustom yourself to sleep much, and 
use yourself to it. 

VI. Every Morning before you rise, to have your 
Feet, Legs, Arms and Hands, well rubb'd with Pieces 
of Woollen Cloth, for half an Hour, and the same go- 
ing to Bed. This Article must be strictly observ'd, for 
by this Means the Humours, Knobs and Bunches will 
|P_5
be dissipated, and prevent their fixing in the Joints, by 
which they become useless. 

VII. You must accustom yourself to Exercise, as ri- 
ding on Horse-back, which is best, or in a Coach, 
Chaise, &c. the more the better; but take Care of the 
cold Weather, Winds, and Rain. 

Lastly, In case a Fit of the Gout should return, and 
be violent, which they are of Opinion will not, then a 
little Dose of Opium or Laudanum may be taken to 
compose you; but no oftner than Necessity requires. 
They are of Opinion, that your Father or Mother ha- 
ving the Gout, is of no Consequence, if you will re- 
solve to follow the foregoing Directions strictly. 

[}A famous Water to preserve the Eye-sight; or if lost, to 
restore it. }]
Take a Rye Loaf, without Salt or Leaven; cut it into 
thin Slices, and distill in a cold Still; take off the Wa- 
ter that comes from it, and drop of it into the Eyes 
twice or thrice every Day, for a Month together. This 
Water cured a Gentleman after he had been blind a 
whole Year. Take also a Rag of Holland Cloth, and 
burn it between two Pewter Dishes, and of the Water that 
comes from it, drop a little into the Eye every Night. 

[}To stop Vomiting. }]
Take a large Nutmeg, grate away half of it, and 
then toast the flat Side till the Oil ouze out; then clap 
it to the Pit of the Stomach. Let it lie so long as 'tis 
warm; repeat it often till cured. 

[}A good Cere-Cloth. }]
Take a Pint and half of Sallad Oil, half a Pound of 
Red-led, a Quarter of a Pound of White-led, a Quarter 
of a Pound of Castle-soap, 2 Ounces of Bees-wax, 2 
Ounces of Oil of Bays, 2 Ounces of Barrows-grease; 
boil the Leads in the Oils till they look brown; then 
put in the rest, keeping it stirring till it works; then 
make it into Rolls, first oiling your Hands. This should 
boil five Hours. 

|P_6
[}To make Dr. Pye's Drink for the Scurvy. }]
Take both the Sorts of Scurvy-grass, of Brooklime 
and Water-cresses, of each three Handfuls; 12 Seville
Oranges cut into Pieces; Winters Bark bruised, 3 Oun- 
ces; being all put into a Bag, infuse in 3 Gallons of 
new Ale. 

[}A Receipt to help the Lungs of a Person in a Con- 
sumption. }]
Take Anniseeds finely powder'd, Saffron of Steel, 
each half an Ounce, made into Pills with Lucatella's 
Balsum. Take five of these every Morning, and at 
Five o'Clock in the Afternoon, drinking a large Draught 
of Water acidulated with Mynsicht's Elixir of Vitriol. 
—After each Dose Riding is of singular Use, and 
Cold-bathing; but above all, frequent Bleeding in small 
Quantities; for, as is before observ'd, whatever keeps 
the Lungs cool, is the only Way to cure Consumptions; 
and it has been of late experienc'd, that crude Mercury 
is the most beneficial Thing for the Lungs, taking one 
Ounce every Morning. 

[}For a Dropsy. }]
Take of Horse-radish Roots sliced thin, and sweet 
Fennel-seeds bruised, of each 2 Ounces, Smallage and 
Fennel-roots sliced, of each an Ounce; of the Tops of 
Thyme, Winter-savory, Sweet-marjoram, Water-cresses, 
and Nettles, of each a Handful; bruise the Herbs, 
and boil them in 3 Pints of Sack, and 3 of Water, to 
the Consumption of Half. Let it stand close cover'd 
for three Hours; then strain it, and drink a Draught of 
it twice a Day, sweeten'd with Syrup of Fennel, fasting 
two Hours after it. 

[}For Deafness. }]
Dip fine, clean black Wool in Civet, put it into the 
Ear, and as it dries, which it will do in a Day or two, 
dip it again, and keep it moist in the Ear three Weeks 
or a Month. 

[}For a Sore Stomach. }]
Take half a Sheet of Cap-Paper, cut it into the 
|P_7
Shape of an Heart, and dip it in Brandy and old Can- 
dle-grease melted together, of each an equal Quantity; 
apply it warm to the Pit of the Stomach. 

[}For a Burn or Scald. }]
Take Laurel Leaves, chop them in Hog's Grease; 
strain it, and keep it for Use. 

[}For the Gripes. }]
Warm a Glass of Canary, dissolve in it as much Ve- 
nice Treacle or Diascordium as an Hazel Nut; drink it 
off going to Bed, and keep warm. 

[}For a Pain or Heat of the Back. }]
Take 3 Drams of Red Sanders, an Handful of Red 
Rose Leaves; steep a whole Night in a Pint of Rose- 
water; strain, and wash your Back with the Tincture 
twice a Day; after once or twice using, you will find 
the Heat to diminish, and your Back to be greatly re- 
fresh'd. 

[}A very good Purge in a Fever. }]
Take Tamarinds 2 Drams, Sena 2 Drams, and Rhu- 
barb 1 Dram; boil these in half a Pint of Water till 
two Thirds be wasted; to what remains, add half an 
Ounce of Cream of Tartar, sweeten'd with one Ounce 
of the Syrup of Succory, or Syrup of Roses solutive; 
strain, and drink it at a Draught; in the Working drink 
clarify'd Whey, rather than Posset-drink. 'Tis good to 
cool and thin the Blood. 

[}A good Vomit. }]
Take 2 Ounces of the finest white Allum, beat it 
small, put it into better than half a Pint of new Milk, 
set it on a slow Fire till the Milk is turn'd clear. Let 
it stand a Quarter of an Hour, strain it off and drink it 
just warm. It will give three or four Vomits, and is 
very safe, and an excellent Cure for an Ague, taken 
half an Hour before the Fit; drink good Store of Car- 
duus Tea after it. Or else take half a Dram of Hypo- 
cocuana, and Carduus Tea with it. 

|P_8
[}A try'd Remedy for Gripes in Children. }]
Take a small Quantity of Oil of Nutmegs and Worm- 
wood; mix them well, and warm them a little, and 
anoint the Child's Navel and Stomach. 

[}The Cure for a Quincey. }]
This Disease requires as high Bleeding as any; you 
must likewise open both Veins under the Tongue. 
Take Frog's Spawn-Water, Red Rose-water, and Plan- 
tane-water, of each 3 Ounces; Syrup of Mulberries 
2 Ounces, the Whites of 3 Eggs beaten to a Water; 
gargle your Throat often with these. Another Garga- 
rism. Take Spring-water 1 Pint, Cream of Tartar 2 
Drams, Mercury Sublimate half a Dram. Levigate 
these very fine, then filtre it off for your Use. Purg- 
ing is very requisite. 

[}A present Remedy for Convulsion-Fits. }]
Make a Draught of an equal Quantity of Piony and 
simple Black-cherry-water; and for a Man put thirty, 
for a Woman twenty, for a Child five Drops of Spirit 
of Harts-horn. Drink this in or before a Fit. 

[}An excellent Remedy for the Cure of the Apoplexy. }]
Take Cinnabar of Antimony, and of Mercurius Dul- 
cis, of each 1 Scruple, made into a Bolus with Conserve 
of Hips. Give such Things as cause Sneezing, as the 
Root of Hellebore, or the Leaves of Assarabacca pow- 
der'd. Apply bruised Garlick to the Hand, Wrists, and 
Soles of the Feet. Likewise give the Julep described in 
the Convulsive Asthma, making it very strong with the 
Spirit of Sal Armoniac. Also high Bleeding may be of 
Service. 

[}Dr. Ratcliff's Receipt for a Cold. }]
Make some Sack-whey with Rosemary boil'd in it; 
mix a little of it in a Spoon with 20 Grains of Gascoin 
Powder; then drink half a Pint of your Sack-whey 
with twelve Drops of Spirit of Harts-horn in it; go to 
Bed, and keep warm. Do this two or three Nights to- 
gether. 

|P_9
[}A Medicine for an Ague. }]
Mix 15 Grains of Salt of Carduus Benedictus, and Salt 
of Wormwood, with half a Scruple of Tartar Vitrio- 
late, and take them in a few Spoonfuls of Rhenish 
Wine, or any other convenient Vehicle, before the Fit, 
or at any Time when the Stomach is empty. 

[}To draw up the Uvula. }]
Take Ground-Ivy and heat it well between 2 Tiles, 
and lay it as warm as can be born on the Top of the 
Head. The Blood of a Hare dry'd and drank in Red- 
wine does stop the Bloody-Flux, or any Lask, tho' ne- 
ver so severe. 

[}Dr. Fryar's Directions for curing the Fits of the Mother. }]
Take 2 Drams of Cream of Tartar; dissolve it in 
half a Pint of Rue-Water; add to it 2 Ounces of Trea- 
cle-water, and take it in the Morning fasting. It al- 
ways cures Fits at once or twice taking, tho' the Person 
has been given over for dead. In all languishing Fits of 
the Mother and Spleen, give three or four Spoonfuls of 
this Julep: Take of Rue, Balm, and Camomile-water, 
of each 3 Ounces; of the Tincture of Castor, 1 Ounce; 
Treacle-water, 2 Ounces; of Confectio Alkermes, 3 
Drams; Syrup of Gillyflowers, 2 Ounces; mix them 
all together. Let the Patient take once or twice a Week, 
four or five of these Purging Pills: Take of Pill. Ruffii, 
and Fœtidæ, of each 1 Dram; of Castor, and the 
Troches of Myrrh, of each half a Dram; of Oyl of 
Amber, a Scruple; of Balsam of Peru, half a Dram; 
make into Pills, and take them over-night. 

[}To cure the Biting of a Mad-Dog. }]
Take a Handful of Rue, Sage, and Cinquefoil, 2 
Garlick Heads, two Penny worth of Treacle, and 2 
Quarts of strong Ale; boil them all together to a Quart; 
strain, and give the Person three or four Spoonfuls twice 
a Day. Apply rusty Bacon, Agrimony, and Dittany, 
beaten well together, to the Sore, to keep it from festering. 

|P_10
[}For a Blow or Hurt in the Eye. }]
Beat the Leaves of Eye-bright with a rotten Apple; 
lay it on the Eye as a Poultice. Repeat it as it grows 
dry. The Juice of the Eye-bright is as good as the 
Leaves. 

[}To cure the Rickets. }]
Make the Drink thus: Take white Horehound and 
Nep, of each 4 Tops; Betony 20 Leaves; Liver-wort 
and Harts-tongue, of each a good Handful; Polipodi- 
um growing upon a Church or Oak, 3 Ounces scrap'd; 
boil all these together in three Quarts of sweet Wort till 
it is consumed to two Quarts; then strain it, and when 
'tis cold, put to it two Quarts of middling Wort, so let it 
work together; then put it in a little Vessel, and when 
it has done working, take half a Quarter of an Ounce 
of Rhubarb sliced very thin; put it in a little Linnen- 
bag, with a Stone in it to keep it from swimming, and 
hang it in the Vessel, and when 'tis three Days old, let 
the Child drink of it a Quarter of a Pint in the Morn- 
ing, and as much at Four o'Clock in the Afternoon, or 
when the Child will take it. You must likewise anoint 
the Child Morning and Night with this following Oint- 
ment: Take Butter in the Month of May, as soon as 
it is taken out of the Churn, and wash it with the Dew 
of Wheat; to a Pound of Butter take a Handful of red 
Sage, as much of Rue, Camomile, and of sowed Hysop; 
boil all these in the Butter, and scum it till 'tis boiled 
clear; then strain it out, and keep it in a Gallipot for 
Use. You must anoint the Reins of the Back and Ribs, 
stroaking it downwards, and upon the small of the Belly, 
and swing the Child often with the Heels upwards. 

[}A Remedy for Convulsions in Children. }]
Give the Child, according to the Age, from 2 to 7 
Grains of the true Volatile Salt of Amber in any pro- 
per Vehicle. 

[}An effectual Remedy for an old Strain. }]
Take of Crown-Soap, a Quarter of a Pound; the 
strongest Wort that you can get, a Pint; of Brandy, 2 
|P_11
Ounces; let them all boil together. About the latter 
End, add to it Myrrh and Bole Armoniack finely pow- 
der'd, of each 3 Drams: Afterwards let it boil to the 
Consistence of a Plaister; which spread upon Sheep's 
Leather, and apply it to the Part affected. 

[}A famous Water to clear the Eyesight. }]
Take of Aloes and Sugar-candy, of each 3 Drams; 
of Camphire half a Dram; of Red Rose and Eyebright 
Water, of each 3 Ounces; shake them very well to- 
gether, and wash your Eyes with it three Times a Day. 

[}A Remedy for the Jaundice. }]
Only take 8 Grains of Turbith Mineral, at Four or 
Five in the Afternoon, drinking thin Gruel or Posset- 
drink between Motions.—After Four or Five Days 
repeat the Turbith as above.—In the intermediate 
Days take half a large Spoonful of Mynsicht's Elixir of 
Vitriol, in half a Pint of Spring Water, three Times a 
Day. 

[}For a Bruise occasion'd by a Fall. }]
Take Horse-dung and Sheep's Suet, of each equal 
Parts; boil them well together, and apply warm to the 
Part affected, like a Poultice. 

[}To stop Bleeding inwardly. }]
Take 2 Drams of Henbane-seed, and the like of 
white Poppy-seed; beat them up with Conserve of Ro- 
ses, and give the Quantity of a Nutmeg at a Time; or 
take 12 Handfuls of Plantane Leaves, and 6 Ounces of 
fresh Comfry-roots; beat these, and strain out the Juice, 
and add to it some fine Sugar, and drink it off. 

[}To draw out a Thorn. }]
Take a little Black Soap, and chew some Nut-ker- 
nels to mix with the Soap, and lay it on to the Place 
griev'd; repeat it till the Thorn comes out. 

[}A Receipt that cured a Gentleman, who had for a long 
time spit Blood in a great Quantity, and was so wasted 
|P_12
with a Consumption, that Dr. Willis declared it was 
impossible for him to recover. }]
Take of Hyssop-water, and of the purest Honey, of 
each a Pint; of Agrimony and Coltsfoot, of each an 
Handful; a Sprig of Rue, brown Sugar-candy, Li- 
quorish sliced, Shavings of Harts-horn, of each 2 Oun- 
ces; Anniseeds bruised, 1 Ounce; of Figs sliced, and 
Raisins of the Sun ston'd, of each 4 Ounces; put them 
all into a Pipkin with a Gallon of Water, and boil it 
gently over a moderate Fire, till Half is consumed; then 
strain it, and when it is cold, put it into Bottles, being 
close stopt; take Four or Five Spoonfuls every Morning, 
at Four in the Afternoon, and at Night the last thing. 
If you add fresh Water to the Ingredients after the first 
Liquor is strain'd off, you will have a pleasant Drink to 
be used at any time when you are a-dry. 

[}For the Green-Sickness. }]
Take Centaury the less, and Wormwood and Rose- 
mary-flowers, of each 1 Handful; Gentian-root 1 Dram; 
Coriander-seeds 2 Drams; boil these in a Quart of Wa- 
ter; sweeten it with Syrup of Steel, and take Four or 
Five Spoonfuls in the Morning, and as much in the Af- 
ternoon. 

[}A Receipt for the Cure of the Stone and Gravel, whether 
in the Ureters, Kidnies, or Bladder. }]
Take Marsh-mallow Leaves, the Herb Mercury, Saxi- 
frage and Pellitory of the Wall, of each, fresh gather'd, 
3 Handfuls; cut them small with a Pair of Scissars, and 
mix them together, and pound them in a clean Stone 
Mortar with a wooden Pestle, till they come to a Mash; 
then take them out, and spread them thin in a broad 
glaz'd Earthen Pan, and let them lie, stirring them about 
once a Day, till they are thoroughly dry, (but not in the 
Sun) and then they are ready, and will keep good all 
the Year long. Of some of these Ingredients so dried, 
make Tea, as you do common Tea, with boiling hot 
Water, as strong as you like to drink it; but the stron- 
ger the better, and drink three, four, or more Tea-Cups 
full of it, Blood warm, sweetened with coarse Sugar, 
|P_13
every Morning and Afternoon, putting into each Cup of 
it, at least half a Spoonful, or rather more, of the ex- 
press'd Oil of Beech Nuts, fresh drawn, (which in this 
Case has been experienced to be vastly preferable to Oil 
of Almonds, or any other Oil) stirring them about to- 
gether, and so to continue it for as long as you see Oc- 
casion. 

[}For a Swelling in the Face. }]
Take a Handful of Damask-Rose Leaves; boil them 
in running Water till they are tender; stamp them 
to a Pulp, and boil white Bread and Milk till 'tis soft; 
then put in your Pulp with a little Hog's-Lard, and 
thicken it with the Yolk of an Egg, and apply it warm. 

[}To abate the Heat and Violence of Fevers, by Dr. Ed. K.}]
Take of Gascoign-Powder and of Coral prepar'd, of 
each 1 Dram and a half; of purified Niter, or Salt Pru- 
nella, 1 Dram; White Sugar finely powder'd, 6 Drams; 
mix, and divide them into 8 equal Parts, of which one is 
to be taken every six Hours in any convenient Vehicle. 
If the Fever proves pestilential, let there be added to the 
aforesaid Powders of the Roots of Contrayerva and Vir- 
ginian Snakeweed, each 1 Dram. 

[}A Draught of the Salts in a Fever. }]
Take Black Cherry Water 2 Ounces; Compound Piony 
Water, 1 Ounce; Salt of Harts-horn, 1 Scruple; Salt 
of Wormwood, half a Dram; Salt of Amber 3 Grains; 
Spirit of Sulphur, 15 Drops: Take this Draught every 
six Hours, till you have taken eight or ten Draughts. 
This has done very great Cures without the Bark, where 
the Fever is occafion'd by a great Cold; it sweetens and 
cools the Blood, and revives the Spirits and Head to Ad- 
miration. 

[}To stop Flooding. }]
Dissolve a Quarter of an Ounce of Venice Treacle in 
4 Spoonfuls of Water, and drop in it thirty or forty of 
Jones's Drops. Take it when Occasion requires, espe- 
cially in Child-bed. 

|P_14
[}A Preservative against the Pestilence. }]
Take of Rue, Sage, Mint, Rosemary, Wormwood 
and Lavender, of each 1 Handful; infuse them in a 
Gallon of the best white Wine Vinegar; put all into 
a Stone Bottle closely cover'd and pasted; set the Bottle, 
thus closed, upon warm Ashes for eight Days together. 
After which, strain it through a Flannel, and put the 
Liquor into Bottles, and to every Quart put an Ounce of 
Camphire; then cork the Bottles very close, and it will 
keep some Years. With this Preparation wash your 
Mouth, rub your Temples and your Loins every Day; 
snuff a little up your Nostrils when you go into the Air, 
and carry about you a Sponge dipt in the same, when 
you desire to refresh the Smell upon any Occasion, espe- 
cially when near to any Place or Person that is infected. 

[}A Cure for the Bite of a Mad Dog. }]
Take 1 Dram of Ash-colour'd Liverwort, 1 Dram of 
common Pepper in a Pint of warm Milk; repeat this 
for Nine or Twelve Mornings successively, using a cold 
Bath at the same time. This Prescription has a very 
eminent Physician now living, for its Author, and he ne- 
ver knew it fail, if taken before the Symptoms ap- 
pear'd. 

[}An easy and approved Remedy for the Rheumatism. }]
Take 5 Ounces of Stone Brimstone, reduce it to a fine 
Powder, divide it into fourteen equal Parts, take one Part 
every Morning in Spring-water. Continue it as you find 
proper. 

[}To make Gripe-Water. }]
Take 2 Dozen Bunches of Penny-royal shred grosly; 
then take Coriander-seeds, Anniseeds, Sweet Fennel-seeds, 
and Carraway-seeds; bruise them all, and put them to 
the Herbs in an Earthen Pot; mix them together, and 
sprinkle on them a Quart of Brandy; let them stand all 
Night; the next Day distil it off, and take six, seven, 
or eight Spoonfuls of this Water sweeten'd with Syrup of 
Gilliflowers. Drink it warm, and go to Bed; cover 
very warm to sweat if you can; and drink some of it 
as long as the Gripes continue. 

|P_15
[}To give certain Ease in the Tooth-ach. }]
Take French Flies, Mithridate, and a few Drops of 
Vinegar; beat this to a Paste, and lay a Plaister on the 
Cheek-bone, or behind the Ear. 'Twill blister, but sel- 
dom sails to cure. 

[}To cure the Shingles. }]
Take the Juice of Housleek, temper it with a suffi- 
cient Quantity of Barley-meal, till it comes to the Con- 
sistence of a Cataplasm; apply it to the Part affected, 
renewing it every 24 Hours. Or, take half a Pint of 
Elder flower Water, and an Ounce of Hungary Water, 
mix and dab the Part with it often. 

[}Dr. Wadenfield's Remedy for Lunacy. }]
Take of Ground-Ivy 3 large Handfuls shred small; 
boif it in 2 Quarts of white Wine, till two Parts in three 
be consumed. Strain, and add to it 6 Ounces of the best 
Salled Oil; boil it up to an Ointment; let the Patient's 
Head be shaved, rub and chafe it with the Ointment 
made warm. Then take fresh Herbs, bruised and ap- 
plied Plaisterwise, tying it on the Top of the Head very 
hard. Repeat this every other Day, ten or twelve 
Times; give the Patient three Spoonfuls of the Juice of 
Ground-Ivy every Morning fasting, in a Glass of Beer 
for the first ten Days. 

[}An Electuary for a Pain in the Stomach. }]
Take Conserve of Wood-sorrel and Mithridate an e- 
qual Quantity; mix it well together, and take it Night 
and Morning the Quantity of a Nutmeg; so do for fif- 
teen Days together. 

[}For a Pain of the Side. }]
Take Stone-horse Dung half a Pound; infuse 12 
Hours in a Quart of the distill'd Water of Carduus, and 
sweeten with Syrup of Violets. Drink a Draught of it 
every four Hours, till the Pain be abated. 

|P_16
[}For a Thrush in Childrens Mouths. }]
Take a hot Sea-Coal, and quench it in as much Spring 
Water as will cover the Coal; wash it with this five or 
six Times a Day. 

[}To cure an Asthma, or Shortness of Breath, by Dr. H. S.}]
Take 3 Ounces of Linseed-Oil fresh drawn; of Bal- 
samick Syrup 1 Ounce, or Sugar-candy powder'd half 
an Ounce; mingle them very well, and give a Spoonful 
of it often. 

[}A Poultice for a Sore Breast before 'tis broken. }]
Boil white Bread and Milk to a Poultice, then put to 
it Oil of Lillies, and the Yolk of an Egg; set it over 
the Fire again to heat, and apply it as hot as can be en- 
dured. Dress it Morning and Night till 'tis broke, then 
dress it with the Poultice of Raisins. 

[}For a Sore Breast when 'tis broken. }]
Take a Quarter of a Pound of Raisins of the Sun 
stoned, and beat them very small; then add to it near 
as much Honey, and beat it together into a Salve; 
spread it on a Cloth, and make Tents if Occasion. Dress 
it once a Day; when 'tis well drawn, use the Yellow 
Balsam, and Black or Leaden Plaister. 

[}For a fresh Strain. }]
Take of Linseed Oil, and rectified Spirit of Wine, 
of each 2 Ounces; Oil of Spike 1 Ounce; mix, and 
rub the Part very well with it, and lay to it a Plaister of 
Paracelsus, with an equal Part of Adburnium. 

[}For Sore Nipples, or Kibe Heels. }]
Take a Pint of the best Sallad Oil, half a Pound of 
Red Lead, 1 Ounce of Red Sealing Wax, and an Ounce 
of Rosin, 6 Ounces of Bees-wax: Put all these together, 
and let them boil to a Salve; as soon as ever it turns 
black, 'tis enough; then put it out presently, or 'twill 
be too hard. When you use it, you must melt it, and 
anoint the Place griev'd, with your Finger spread it on 
|P_17
a Cloth, and keep a Plaister on it. This may be very 
good; but I think nothing so effectually cures Kibe 
Heels, as doing them with Camphiriz'd Spirits before 
they break. 

[}To provoke the Terms, and bring away the After-Birth. }]
Let the Patient take half a Dram of the Troches of 
Myrrh, made into a Bolus with Syrup of Mug-wort, 
every Morning and Evening, drinking 4 Spoonfuls of 
the following Mixture after it: Take of the Waters of 
Penny-royal and Rue, each 4 Ounces; of Compound 
Briony-water 3 Ounces; Tincture of Saffron 1 Ounce; 
Syrup of Marsh-mallows 2 Ounces. 

[}A good Drink in the Rickets. }]
Take Currants and Raisins of the Sun ston'd, of each 
1 Handful; Maiden-hair, Yarrow, and Speedwell, of 
each 1 Handful; a large Handful of Liver-wort; a 
Handful of Dragons Leaves; 9 Leaves of Harts-tongue; 
a Spoonful of Aniseeds, and an Ounce of Liquorice 
sliced; boil all these in three Quarts of small Ale, till 
half be consumed; then strain it, and put it in little 
Bottles, and drink a Draught of it every Morning, and 
at Four in the Afternoon. 

[}For a Rheumatism, or Pain in the Bones. }]
Take a Quart of Milk, boil it and turn it with 3 
Pints of Small Beer; then strain the Posset on seven 
or nine Globules of Stone-Horse Dung tied up in a 
Cloth, and boil it a Quarter of an Hour in the Posset- 
drink; when 'tis taken off the Fire, press the Cloth 
hard, and drink half a Pint of this Morning and Night 
hot in Bed. If you please, you may add white Wine 
to it. This Medicine is not good, if troubled with the 
Stone. 

[}An experienc'd Water for a Sore Mouth. }]
Take half a Pint of white Wine Vinegar; of Roch- 
Alum the Quantity of a Nut; of Red Sage, Colum- 
bine, and Violet Leaves, of each a small Handful; boil 
them together, about the latter End add a Spoonful of 
|P_18
Honey; strain, and sweeten with a little fine Sugar, and 
wash your Mouth with it every Morning and Evening. 

[}The Composing Draught for the Cholick. }]
Take 2 large Spoonfuls of Mint-water, 2 of Hyste- 
rickWater, 1 of Oil of Sweet Almonds, and 1 Ounce 
of Syrup of Diacodium; if 'tis for a Man, add 10 Drops 
of liquid Laudanum, and 20 Drops of Spirit of Harts- 
horn; if for a Woman, only 20 Drops of Tincture of 
Castor; add also for either 2 or 3 Drops of Oil of Ju- 
niper. Drink this Draught, and, under God, you may 
absolutely depend on Rest and Ease, and a safe Cure; 
for the same does so gently make its Passage, as, by 
Repetition, is sure to carry off that sharp Humour that 
was the Cause of this Tumult in the Bowels; and then 
an Opiat may be safely given, when this Operation is 
over; but before, 'tis dangerous. I would very earnestly 
recommend this Method, because 'twas thirty Years the 
successful Practice of an excellent Apothecary. 

[}A very good Water against a Consumption. }]
Take 3 Pints of the best Canary, and a Pint of Mint- 
water, 3 Ounces of candy'd Eringo-Roots, 3 Ounces of 
Dates, a Quarter of an Ounce of Mace, 3 Ounces of 
China Roots, 3 Ounces of Raisins stoned: Infuse these 
twelve Hours in an earthen Pot close covered over a gen- 
tle Fire; when 'tis cold, strain it out, and keep it in a 
clean Pan, or Glass Jar for use. Then make about a 
Quart of plain Jelly of Harts-horn, and drink a Quar- 
ter of a Pint of this Liquor with a large Spoonful of 
Jelly Night and Morning for two or three Months. 

[}To make a Poultice of Turnips, which both ripens and dis- 
cusses any hard Swelling. }]
Take 6 large Turnips, scrape them clean, and boil them 
in powder'd Beef Broth till they are tender; then take 
them out and scrape them again, and being bruised, put 
them into a Pipkin, with a Quarter of a Pound of Mutton- 
Suet shred small, and 1 Ounce of Venice Turpentine; 
boil them well together, adding 2 Ounces of Oil of Ro- 
ses. Lay this to the Part affected twice a Day, as hot 
|P_19
as it can be endured. This will in a short Time either 
discuss the Humour, or, if it tends to Suppuration, will 
both break and heal it. 

[}To make Lozenges sor the Heart-burn. }]
Take of white Sugar-candy 1 Pound, Chalk 3 Oun- 
ces, Bole-armoniac 5 Scruples, Crabs-eyes 1 Ounce, Red 
Coral 4 Scruples, Nutmegs 1 Scruple, Pearl 2 Scruples; 
let all these be beaten and sifted, and made all into a 
Paste with a little Spring-water, roll it out and cut your 
Lozenges out with a Thimble; lay them to dry. Eat 
four or five at a Time as often as you please. 

[}To cure a Pain of the Head, which returns at set Times 
like an Ague. }]
Take 2 Scruples of Jesuit's Bark, make it into a Bo- 
lus, with a sufficient Quantity of Syrup of Gillyflowers. 
To be repeated every six Hours; being constantly taken 
for three Days, it seldom fails of Success. 

[}A Posset-drink to be taken before the Fit of an Ague. }]
Pour a Gallon of clear Postet-drink upon 4 large 
Handfuls of Angelica shred small; let it infuse till 'tis 
very strong. Let the Person, if possible, drink all, that 
the Stomach may be perfectly clear; and go into a warm 
Bed as soon as the Vomit has done working. Cover 
yourself close, and try to sweat. It has seldom fail'd, 
and is a safe Vomit. 

[}An Electuary for a Cold, or Windy Stomach. }]
Take Gum-Ganicum 1 Ounce, Cubebs a Quarter of 
an Ounce, Cardamums a Quarter of an Ounce; beat 
and sift all these, and mix it with Syrup of Gillyflowers 
into an Electuary. Take Night and Morning the Quan- 
tity of a Nutmeg; drink a little warm Ale after it. 

[}For a Weakness, or Giddiness in the Head. }]

Take of Sage, Rosemary, Lillies of the Valley, the 
Tops of Sweet-marjoram, of each half an Ounce; of 
Nutmeg and of Asarabacca-roots, each 1 Dram; dry 
them, and reduce them to a very fine Powder. 

[}To prevent Miscarrying. }]
Take of Dragon's-blood the Weight of a Silver Two- 
pence, and a Dram of red Coral; the Weight of 2 
Barley-corns of Ambergrease, the Weight of 3 Barley- 
corns of East-India Bezoar; make all these into a very 
fine Powder, and mix them well together, and keep 
them close in a Box; and if you are frightned, or need 
it, take as much at a Time as will lie on a Penny, and 
keep very still and quiet. Take it in a Caudle made 
with Muscadine or Tent, and the Shucks of Almonds 
dried and beaten to Powder, and thicken it with the 
Yolks of Eggs: Take it in the Morning fasting, and 
at Night going to Bed. This do till you are out of 
Danger, and lay the following Plaister to the Back: 
Take Venice Turpentine, and mix with it Bole-Armo- 
niac, and spread it on black-brown Paper the Length 
and Breadth of a Hand, and lay it to the Small of the 
Back, keeping Bed.

Milk, and boil in it some Penny-royal, and a few Ca- 
momile Flowers. 

[}For St. Anthony's Fire. }]
Take one Part fine Spirit or Oil of Turpentine, and 
one Part finely rectify'd Spirit of Wine; mix and shake 
the Glass when you use it, anointing the Face gently 
with a Feather, or your Finger, not covering it. Do 
it often, and it cures in a Day or two; but take Care 
not to come near your Eyes. It softens and heals, tho' 
at first you think it inflames. You may put more or less 
Spirit of Wine, as you like. 

[}To provoke Urine presently when stopped. }]
In a Quart of Beer boil a Handful of the Berries of 
Eglantine till it comes to a Pint; drink it off lukewarm.

Skull prepar'd, of each 1 Dram: Give a Scruple of it 
every Morning in a Quarter of a Pint of Peony Water;

[}To cure Burstenness. }]
Take Hemlock, and bruise it a little; heat it pretty 
well, and apply it twice a Day, without any Truss, and 
|P_22
keep the Party as still as may be. This has cured, when 
many other Things have failed. 

[}A most excellent Process in a Consumption. }]

in half a Pint of Ass's or Cow's Milk, and Barley-wa- 
ter, every Morning; take as much of the Conserve as 
a Chesnut, thrice every Day, and drink after it some of 
the Milk-water, sweeten'd with the Balsamick Syrup; 
take three of the Pectoral Pills going to Rest; and re- 
peat the Dose, if your Cough disturbs your Rest; and 
once a Week take four of the Purging Pills at Night; 
|P_23
make an Issue in the Arm; and once in a Month, or six 
Weeks, take three or four Ounces of Blood away. 

This is so safe and valuable a Method, that I shall on- 
ly say, that every good Judgment must approve it. 

[}A Drink to preserve the Lungs. }]
Take 3 Pints of Spring-water, put to it 1 Ounce of 
Flower of Sulphur, and let it boil on a slow Fire till 
Half is consumed; then let it stand to settle, and strain

In this Distemper bleed in large Quantities, keeping 
the Patient very cool, and constantly plying him with 
cool Tankards, and such diluting Liquors, giving every 
Evening about Five o'Clock, an Ounce, or an Ounce 
and an half of Diacodium. If that does not procure 
Rest, after three Hours repeat it. Sharpen all his Malt 
Liquors with Spirit of Vitriol. If it be of the Flux or 
Anomalous Kind, the seventh Day give him Mercurius 
|P_24
Dulcis and Cinnabar of Antimony, of each half a Scru- 
ple, made into a Bolus with any Conserve; and do the 
like again the thirteenth Day. The tenth Day you may

When the last critical Day is over, bleed to about 
twelve Ounces, the next Day purge, with that set down 
in the Gout, taking a quieting Draught of Diacodium 
at Night when the Purging is over. Purging and Bleed- 
ing after this, must upon no Account be omitted; other- 
wise the Patient will break out in Boils, and will have 
very sore and weak Eyes for a considerable Time. 

[}An excellent Remedy for Whooping Coughs. }]
Take dried Coltsfoot Leaves a good Handful, cut 
them small, and boil them in a Pint of Spring-water, 
till half a Pint is boiled away; then take it off the Fire, 
and when it is almost cold, strain it thro' a Cloth, squeez- 
ing the Herb as dry as you can; and then throw it a- 
way, and dissolve in the Liquor an Ounce of brown Su- 
gar-candy finely powder'd, and then give the Child, (if 
it be about three or four Years old, and so in Propor- 
tion) one Spoonful of it cold or warm, as the Season 
proves, three or four Times a Day (or oftner if the Fits 
of Coughing come frequently) till well; which will be

the Fits of Coughing.

Volatile Salt of Harts-horn 4 Grains, Syrup of Cloves, 
a sufficient Quantity to make it into a Bolus. To be 
taken going to Rest, drinking a large Draught of warm 
Mountain-Whey or Treacle Posset, after it. To such 
Constitutions as cannot be provok'd to sweat, Opening a 
Vein, or a gentle Purge, will be of great Service. 

[}To stop Vomiting. }]
Take half a Pint of Mint-water, an Ounce of Syrup 
of Violets, a Quarter of an Ounce of Mithridate, and 
half an Ounce of Syrup of Roses; mix all these well

of Ale; let the Pot stand in a warm Place, close co- 
ver'd for 12 Hours. Take half a Pint of the Liquor,

Take Tops of Carduus, Tops of Centory, Roman
Wormwood, and Flowers of Camomile, (all of them 
dried, and of the latest Year's Growth that you use them 
in) of each a small Handful; cut the Herbs small, but 
not the Flowers, and put them, with an Ounce of Worm- 
seed bruised small, into an earthen Jar or Pickling-Pot, 
and pour upon them a Quart of Spring Water, cold; stir 
all about, and then tie the Pot over with a double Paper, 
and let it stand 48 Hours, opening and stirring it about 
five or six Times in that Space. At the End of 48 Hours 
strain it thro' a Cloth, squeezing the Herbs as dry as 
you can, which fling away, and of the Liquor, give to 
a Child from two to four or five Years old, half a Spoon- 
ful, more or less, mixt with a Quarter of a Spoonful of 
Oil of Beech Nuts, every Morning, upon an empty Sto- 
mach, and to fast for about an Hour after it; and also 
the same Dose about Four or Five in the Afternoon, 
every Day for a Week or ten Days together; by which 
time, if the Case be Worms, and you make but Obser- 
vation, you will find them come away, either dead or 
alive. Older Children must take more, in Proportion 
to their Ages, and grown Persons from three or four to 
six or eight Spoonfuls, or more, with always half the 
Quantity of the said Oil mixt with each Dose, and it 
will keep the Body soluble, and sometimes a little loose. 

[}For a Stitch in the Side. }]
Take Rosin, pound and sift it, and with Treacle mix 
it into an Electuary, and lick it up often in the Day or 
Night.

them clean with a sharp Knise, cut them in long Beeds,

Vervain; and so do till 'tis the Bigness of the Child's 
Neck. Then take as much red Wine as you think the 
Necklace will suck up, and put into it a Dram of red 
Coral, as much single Peony-root finely powder'd. Soak 
your Beads in this 28 Hours, and rub the Powder on the 
Beads. Syrup of Lemons, and Syrup of single Peony,

quently.

[}A new Method for curing the Venereal Disease. }]
It need not be said what direful Accidents daily hap- 
pen to People by Salivations, as the Loss of Teeth, of 
Hearing, of a healthful Constitution, and often even 
Loss of Life itself: And what makes this Case still more 
deplorable, is, that it has been generally thought, that 
nothing but an high Salivation is the proper and adequate 
Cure for this Distemper: But the learned Dr. Chicoyneau
has happily discovered and proved the contrary. His 
Method, which is sometimes called, The Montpellier Me- 
thod, and sometimes, The new French Method, and which 
is attended with very little Pain, and no Danger at all, 
is as follows: 

The Doctor, according as he finds the Patient's Case 
to be, sometimes orders a little Blood to be taken away, 
sometimes a gentle Purge or two to be taken, but always 
makes him bathe five or six times, and always an Hour 
each time; after which the whole Operation consists in 
nothing more than rubbing his Feet, Legs, and Arms, 
four, five, or six times, as the Case requires, with a Mer- 
curial Ointment, in such Quantities, and at such proper 
Intervals of Time, that no high Salivation may be raised 
thereby: Sometimes indeed, but not always, a gentle 
moderate Spitting will ensue, nor is it possible, in some 
Constitutions, to prevent it; but then 'tis never carried 
high, nor encouraged; 'tis neither troublesome nor dan- 
gerous. The Patient during this time keeps his Cham- 
ber, and observes a regular Diet; and all he suffers is, 
only a little feverish Heat and Restlessness sometimes for 
a Day or two, when the Operation is at the Height. 

After this Manner only, without any further Trouble 
or Danger, does Dr. Chicoyneau cure the most inveterate 
Pox, with all its Symptoms and Attendants: 'Tis there- 
fore greatly to be wished, that all our Surgeons and o- 
thers, who undertake the Cure of this Disease, could be 
prevailed on, out of regard to the Ease and Safety of 
|P_30
Mankind, wholly to lay aside the old pernicious Way of 
Salivation, and embrace this new and safe Method. 

There are some hundreds of Gentlemen in England, 
that can, from their own Experience, bear Witness to 
to the Excellency and Efficacy of it. 

[}For the Hemorrhoids. }]
Take of Diapalma melted down very thin, with Oil 
of Chamomil 1 Ounce; put to it Saffron finely pow- 
der'd 1 Scruple; Opium 3 Grains; mix them well, and 
being moderately warm, anoint the Part affected. 

[}Black Cherry Water for Children. }]
Take 6 Pounds of Black Cherries, and bruise them 
small; then put to them the Tops of Rosemary, Sweet- 
marjoram, Spearmint, Angelica, Balm, Marigold-flow- 
ers, of each a Handful; dried Violets 1 Ounce; An- 
niseeds and sweet Fennel-seeds, of each half an Ounce 
bruised. Cut the Herbs small, and mix all together, 
and distil them off in a cold Still. This Water is excel- 
lent for Children, giving them two or three Spoonfuls 
at a Time. 

[}To make Barley Water. }]
Take of Pearl-Barley 4 Ounces; put it in a large Pip- 
kin, and cover it with Water; when the Barley is thick 
and tender, put in more Water and boil it up again; 
and so do till 'tis of a good Thickness to drink; then 
put in a Blade or two of Mace, or a Stick of Cinna- 
mon. Let it have a Walm or two, and strain it out, 
and squeeze in the Juice of two or three Lemons, and a 
Bit of the Peel, and sweeten it to your Taste with fine 
Sugar. Let it stand till 'tis cold, and then run it thro' 
a Bag, and bottle it out; it will keep three or four Days. 

[}A certain Remedy to take Fire out of a Burn. }]
Beat an Apple with Sallad Oil till 'tis a Poultice pretty 
soft; bind it on the Part; and as it dries, lay on fresh. 
You must be sure to pare, core, and beat your Apple 
well, for fear of breaking the Skin of the Burn: But 
if the Skin be off, there is not any Thing in Nature so 
sure to take out the Fire. 

|P_31
[}A Wash to cure the Itch. }]
Take 1 Quart of Spring-Water, dissolve in it 1 Dram 
of Sublimate, Cream of Tartar half an Ounce: Wash 
the Pustules over with this at Night going to Bed. 
Change your Linnen, and in three Nights at farthest 
you will be well. 'Tis necessary at least to purge. 
Bleeding is likewise very proper. 

[}To destroy Buggs. }]
Take of the highest rectify'd Spirit of Wine, (viz.
Lamp Spirits) that will burn all away dry, and leave 
not the least Moisture behind, half a Pint; newly di- 
still'd Oil, or Spirit of Turpentine, half a Pint; mix 
them together, and break into it, in small Bits, half an 
Ounce of Camphire, which will dissolve in it in a few 
Minutes; shake them well together, and with a Piece 
of Spunge, or a Brush dipt in some of it; wet very 
well the Bed or Furniture wherein those Vermin har- 
bour and breed, and it will infallibly kill and destroy 
both them and their Nits, although they swarm ever 
so much. 

[}For Coughs, especially such as proceed from thin Rheums. }]
Take of choice Olibanum finely powder'd, from 1 
Scruple to half a Dram; and mix carefully with it an 
equal Weight of Sugar-candy, (white or brown) or, in 
want of that, of fine Sugar; and let the Patient take it 
at Bed-time in the Pap of an Apple, or some other pro- 
per Additament, for several Nights together. If it be 
found needful, it may be taken at any other time, when 
the Stomach is empty. 

[}To give Ease in the Pains of the Stone, even that of 
the Bladder. }]
Take the transparent Spar that grows upon the Veins 
of Lead Ore, and having reduced it to a fine Powder, 
give from half a Dram to a whole Dram of it at a time, 
in a moderate Draught of some convenient Vehicle. 
N. B. Though there be (at least in most of our English
Mines) two Teguments, as it were, of the Veins of 
|P_32
Lead, that grow close together, yet that which the Dig- 
gers name Cawk, which is white and opacous, is not 
the Medicine I mean; but the transparent, or at least 
Semi-Diaphanus, which easily breaks into smooth Frag- 
ments, and in the Fire cleaves into several Pieces, that 
are wont to be smooth, and prettily shaped.
