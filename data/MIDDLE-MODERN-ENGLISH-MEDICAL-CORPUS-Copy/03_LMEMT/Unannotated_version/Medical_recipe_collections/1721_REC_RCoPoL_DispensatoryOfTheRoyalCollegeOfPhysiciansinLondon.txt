[}The Common Simple Distilled 
Waters. }]
All the Herbs from which Simple Waters are drawn, 
ought to be green, fresh, and a little bruised. They 
are to be raised by a Sand-Heat, or an Alembick 
with its Refrigeratory; and such a Quantity of 
Spring-water is to be allowed as is sufficient to 
prevent an Eupyreuma. For the most part one 
Gallon may be conveniently drawn from eight Pound 
of green Herbs. 

[}From the Leaves and Buds of }]
BOth the Wormwoods, Angelica, Car- 
duus B. Succory, the greater Celandine, 
Eyebright, Fenile, Fumatory, Hyssop, 
Marjoram, Baum, Mint, Parsley, Plan- 
taine, Peneroyal, Oak, Rue, Saxifrage, and Mea- 
dow Sweet. 

|P_2
[}From the Flowers of }]
Oranges, Chamomile, Beans, Lillies of the Val- 
ley, Red Poppies, Cowslips, Piony, Rosema- 
ry, White Red and Damask Roses, Elder and 
Limes. 

[}From the Fruits of }]
Citrons the Peal, Rasp-Berries, Green Wal- 
nuts and Black Cherries. From twelve Pounds of 
the latter of which, bruised with the Stones, draw 
one Gallon. 

[}From an Animal}]
Froggs-Spawn. 

Herein is made a very great reduction of the 
Simple Waters, and certainly with good rea- 
son, because there were not only many before 
ordered of no Efficacy, but likewise were they 
so numerous, that a great deal of needless trou- 
ble and expence were employed to keep them 
all in readiness. It may possibly be disputed, 
whether all these now retained, are of Impor- 
tance or Efficacy enough to deserve it, but it 
is to be remembred, that very little dependence 
is put upon any Simple Water, they being sel- 
dom used but as Vehicles to things of greater 
Virtue; and in many Circumstances a Vehicle 
is so much the better, for being destitute of any 
Medicinal Flavour or Taste, as it the more 
gatefully conveys down what the greatest Stress 
is laid upon. 

|P_3[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}The Distilled and Compound Waters. }]
The Herbs are to be chosen green, unless particularly 
ordered to the contrary. In defect of those 
which are green, about a fourth part of the dry 
may be substituted, and so much Spring Water 
is to be allowed as will prevent their burning to 
the Still. 

[}Aqua Absinthii minus Composita. }]
[}The lesser Composition of Wormwood Water. }]
Take of the Leaves of dried Wormwood two 
Pounds; of the lesser Cardamom Seeds two Ounces; 
and of Coriander Seeds half a Pound. Infuse them 
all in four Gallons of French Brandy, and draw off 
the same Quantity by Distillation. 

After the same manner (with an Omission of 
these Seeds, and for that Reason an Augmenta- 
tion of four Times the Quantity of Herbs) are 
made Waters from the whole Plants of Angelica, 
Baum, Mint, Sage, &c. The Flowers of Rose- 
mary, Seeds of Carriway, lesser Cardamoms, A- 
nise, &c. Juniper Berries, Orange, Citron, and 
Lemon-Peel, &c.

This differs chiefly from the former, by sub- 
stituting Cardamom and Coriander Seeds in room 
of the Aniseeds, which makes it more cordial 
and grateful to the Stomach; the Aniseeds 
yielding too foul an Oil to suit it for such Pur- 
poses. 

|P_4
[}Aqua Absinthii magis Composita. }]
[}The greater Composition as Wormwood Water. }]
Take of the Sea, and Common Wormwood 
dryed, each one Pound; of Sage, Mint, and 
Baum dryed, each two handfuls; of the Roots 
of Galangals, Ginger, Calamus Aromaticus, and 
Elicampaine; of the Seeds of Sweet Fenile and 
Coriander, each three drams; Cinnamon, Cloves, 
and Nutmegs, each two drams; of the lesser 
Cardamoms and Cubebs, each one dram. Cut and 
bruise the Ingredients as they require and after 
some time Infusion of them in twelve Pints of 
French Brandy, draw off the same quantity by 
Distillation. 

This differs from the former in rejecting Li- 
quorice Root and Raisons, which can have no 
effect in Distallation; and in allowing a greater 
proportion of Spirit, and more to be drawn off; 
the former being too much loaded with the 
oily Ingredients to admit either of its being fine 
to the Eye, or grateful to the Stomach. 

[}Aqua Angelicæ magis Composita. }]
[}The greater Composition of Angelica-Water. }]
Take of Angelica Root and the Leaves of Car- 
duus, each six Ounces; of Baum and Sage, each 
four Ounces; of Angelica Seeds six Ounces; and 
of Sweet Fenile Seeds nine Ounces. Let the 
dryed Herbs and Seeds be grosly bruised, and to 
them add of Cinnamon two Drams; of Cloves and 
Mace each one Dram and half; of Nutmegs, and 
the lesser Cardamon Seeds each one Dram; of Cu- 
bebs and Galangal Root each one Dram and half 
|P_5
of Jamaica-Pepper and Saffron, each one Dram. 
Infuse them in two Gallons of French Brandy, and 
draw off as much by Distillation. 

This hath rejected the Species Diamoschu 
Dulcis, and Aromaticum Rosatum, that were 
in the former, those two Compositions being 
also wholly expunged this Dispensatory, and in 
their room are added Spices more convenient- 
ly answering the same Intentions. 

[}Spiritus Lavendulæ Compositus. }]
[}Compound Spirit of Lavender. }]
Take Flowers of Lavender one Gallon, pour 
upon them four Gallons of French Brandy, and 
thereunto add fresh Flowers of sage, Rosemary 
and Betony, each one handful; of Burrage, Bugloss, 
Lillies of the Valley and Cowslips, each two hands- 
ful; of the Leaves of Baum, Feverfew, and the 
Orange-Tree fresh gathered, of the Flowers of 
Stœchas, Oranges and Bay-Berries, each one Ounce. 
Digest these together, and draw off in B. M. two 
Gallons and an half. Then add of the outer Bark 
of Cinnamon, Nutmegs, and Mace, of the lesser 
Cardamom Seeds, and Cubebs, each half an Ounce; 
of Aloes Wood, one Dram. Digest these for twen- 
ty four Hours, and filter the Spirit; then, if it be 
thought proper, add of Musk, Ambergrease, and 
Saffron, each half a Scruple; Red Roses dryed, 
and red Saunders, each half an Ounce. Let the 
Species be tyed up in a thin Bag, and suspended in 
the Spirit. 

Herein is avoided the needless Trouble of a 
double Distillation, as it was before ordered, and 
the Piony-seeds omitted, as of no use in a Com- 
|P_6
position of such an Intention, notwithstanding 
some Parts of the same Plant agree well enough 
therewith. The Sweets also here left at dis- 
cretion, because in many Purposes they are dis- 
agreeable to the main End of the Composition; 
proving to some particular Constitutions the op- 
posite to a Cordial, or a Cephalic, which this 
Medicine is in the highest Degree. 

[}Spiritus Castorei. }]
[}Spirit of Castor. }]
Take of the Best Russia Castor, four Ounces; 
of the dryed Flowers of Lavender, an Ounce; of 
Sage and Rosemary Flowers, each half an Ounce; 
of Cinnamon six Drams; of Mace and Cloves, each 
two Drams; of French Brandy rectifyed six Pints. 
And let the whole Quantity of Spirit be drawn off 
in B. M. so that the Ingredients be left quite dry. 

This is left exactly as in the old Dispensatory, 
without any Alterations; as being a Medicine 
well contrived both in the Qualities and Propor- 
tions of its Ingredients, to answer the Intentions 
of an efficacious Cephalic. 

[}Spiritus Croci. }]
[}Spirit of Saffron. }]
Take four Ounces of the best English Saffron, 
infuse it in four pints of French Brandy, and draw 
of two Pints and an half in B. M.

This hath been heretofore ordered with seve- 
ral Repetitions of Spirit and Distillations; but 
considering the good Uses the Residuum may be 
put to of making a Tincture, Syrup, or Extract, 
that Pains may be well spared, and the Spirit 
|P_7
the better for it; because the first Infusion and 
Distillation certainly takes away the best of the 
Saffron. 

[}Aqua Raphani Composita. }]
[}Compound Horse-Raddish Water. }]
Take of the Leaves of both the Scurvy-grasses, 
fresh gathered in the Spring, each six Pound; 
bruise them and press out the Juice, and to it add 
the Juices of Brooklime and Water-Cresses, each 
one Pint and an half; of Horse-Raddish Root two 
Pounds; of Arum Root fresh, six Ounces; of 
Winter's Bark and Nutmegs, each four Ounces; of 
Lemon Peels dryed two Ounces; of French Brandy 
4 Pints; and draw off by Distillation eight Pints. 

This hath rejected the Bryony Root, which 
is ordered in a large Quantity in the old Dispen- 
satory, but nauseates the Flavour of the Water, 
and gives no Virtues suitable to the main Inten- 
tion of the whole. The Arum Root is likewise 
herein inceased in this Quantity, it being ordered 
in the former but half an Ounce, whereby the 
Medicine is rendered yet more pungent, and 
more efficacious as an Antiscorbutic, or a Ne- 
phritic, both which Purposes it is calculated for. 

[}Aqua Pæoniæ Composita. }]
[}Compound Piony Water. }]
Take Lillies of the Vally Flowers fresh gathered 
one Pound, and infuse them in two Gallons and an 
half of French Brandy; and to the same put of Lime 
Flowers half a Pound; of Piony four Ounces; 
of the Male Piony Root two Ounces and an half; 
white Dittany, and long Birthwort, of each half 
an Ounce; of Misletoe of the Oak, and Rue, each 
|P_8
two Handsful; of Piony Seeds husked ten Drams; 
and of the Seeds of Rue three Drams and an half; 
of Russia Castor, Cubebs and Mace, each two 
Drams; of Cinnamon an Ounce and an half; of 
Rosemary Flowers six Pugils; of Stœchas and 
Lavender Flowers, each four Pugils; of Betony, 
Clove, and Cowslip Flowers, each eight Pugils; 
of the Juice of Black Cherries four Pints, and from 
the whole draw off by Distillation four Gallons. 

This hath left out some of the insignificant 
Ingredients that were in before, and particular- 
the Squills; and avoided also the Trouble of a 
double Distillation, which was altogether need- 
less. This is the same as was originally inserted 
by the College in their first Dispensatory, under 
the Title of Aqua Antipileptica Langii. 

[}Aqua Epidemica. }]
[}Plague Water. }]
Take of the Leaves of Celandine, Rosemary, Rue, 
Sage, Roman Wormwood, Dragon, Agrimony, 
Baum, Scordium, the lesser Centaury, Carduus, 
Betony and Mint, each two Handsful; of the 
dried Angelica Root, Zedoary, and Gentian, each 
one Ounce; of the Virginia Snake-Root half an 
Ounce. Let them be infused in one Gallon of 
French Brandy, and draw off ten Pints by Distil- 
lation. 

This very much differs from the old Dispen- 
satory, and besides the Addition of many new 
Herbs, leaves out the Masterwort, Piony, and 
Butter-Bur Roots; insomuch that the Intention 
of the Medicine seems changed from an Alexi- 
pharmic into a Cardiac. It is taken from Ship- 
ton's Additions to the former Dispensatory. 

|P_9
[}Aqua Gentiana Composita. }]
[}Compound Gentian Water. }]
Take Gentian sliced one Pound and an half; of 
the Leaves and Flowers of the Lesser Centaury, 
each four Ounces: Infuse them in six Pints of 
French Brandy, and distil eight Pints. 

This differs not at all from the former, but 
in the change of White Wine for French Bran- 
dy. The Extract may most conveniently be 
made from the Residuum after Distillation. 

[}Aqua Theriacalis. }]
[}Treacle Water. }]
Take of the Juice of green Walnuts four Pints; 
of Juice of Rue three Pints; of Carduus and 
Baum, each two Pints; of the fresh gathered 
Butter-Bur Roots one Pound and an half; of Bur- 
dock one pound; of Angelica and Master-wort, 
each half a Pound; of green Scordium four Hands- 
ful; of old Venice Treacle and Mithridate, each 
eight Ounces; of Lemon Juice two Pints; of 
French Brandy one Gallon an an half. Draw off 
by Distillation three Gallons and an half, and then 
add four Pints of distilled Vinegar. 

This omits the needless and ridiculous circum- 
stance in the former, of depurating the Lemon 
Juice before Distillation, and very prudently 
adds the distilled Vinegar afterwards, instead of 
putting it into the Still; because with such Ma- 
nagement it effectually answers all its Intentions, 
and risques less hazard of carrying along with 
the Medicine any Part of the Metal, with which 
the Alembick is made, as all Acids are apt to do. 
|P_10
This stands in the old Dispensatories under the 
Title of Aqua Theriacalis Stillititia, to distin- 
guish it from the Aqua Theriacalis per Infusio- 
nem ordered in the Leyden and some other Dis- 
pensatories. 

[}Aqua Bryoniæ Composita. }]
[}Compound Bryony Water. }]
Take of the Juice of Bryony Roots four Pints; 
of the Juice of Rue and Mugwort, each two Pints; 
of the Leaves of Savine three Handsful, Mother- 
wort, Catmint and Peneroyal, each two Handsful; 
of Basil and Dittany, each one Handful and an half; 
of fresh outer Peel of Oranges four Ounces; of 
Myrrh two Ounces; of Russia Castor one Ounce; 
Spirit of Wine eight Pints, and draw off twelve 
Pints by Distillation. 

There is no Alteration made in this, except in 
ordering a French Spirit for Canary; it being 
by all received for a well contrived Composi- 
tion for the Intention of an Hysteric. 

[}Aqua Imperialis. }]
[}Imperial Water. }]
Take of dried Citron-Peels, and Orange-peels, 
of Nutmeds, Cloves and Cinnamon, each two 
Ounces; Roots of Cypress, Florentine Orrice, and 
Calumus Aromaticus, each one Ounce; of Zedoa- 
ry, Galangal and Ginger each half an Ounce; of 
the Tops of Lavender, and Rosemary each two 
Handsful; of the Leaves of Bays, Marjoram, 
Baum, Mint, Sage, and Thyme each one Handful; 
of the Flowers of the white and red Roses each half 
an Handful; Damask-Rose Water four Pints; of 
French Brandy one Gallon, and draw off ten Pints 
by Distillation. 

|P_11
This remains as in the former, only with the 
common Alteration of Spirit for Wine; and the 
whole concurs to make a very grateful Cordial 
and Cephalic. 

[}Aqua Mirabilis. }]
[}The wonderful Water. }]
Take of Cloves, Galangals, Cubebs, Mace, 
the lesser Cardamoms, Nutmegs, and Ginger, each 
one Dram; Juice of the greater Celandine half a 
Pint; French Brandy two Pints and an half, and 
draw off the same Quantity by Distillation. 

This remains as before, unless with the com- 
mon Alteration of Spirit for Wine; and will 
want either Precipitation, or Filtration to sepa- 
rate the oily Parts, which make it milky, and 
disagreeable to the Eye. 

[}Aqua Doctoris Stephani. }]
[}Dr. Stephens's Water. }]
Take of Cinnamon, Ginger, Galangal, Cloves, 
Nutmegs, Grains of Paradise, of the Seeds of 
Anise, sweet Fenil, and Caraway, each one Dram; 
of the Leaves of Thyme, Mother of Thyme, 
Mint, Sage, Peneroyal, Rosemary, Flowers of 
red Roses, Chamomile, Origanum and Lavender, 
each one Handful; of French Brandy six Pints, and 
draw off one Gallon by Distillation. 

This likewise agrees with the former Prescrip- 
tion in the old Dispensatory, unless in the Ex- 
change of Spirit for Wine, and all the Ingre- 
dients well suit the main Intention of a Cepha- 
lic, a Cordial, or a Carminative. 

|P_12
[}Aqua Protheriacalis. }]
[}A Succedaneum for Treacle Water. }]
Take of the Leaves of Scordioum, Scabius, Car- 
duus, and Goats-Rue, each two Handsful; of Ci- 
tron-Peel, and Orange-Peel dried, each half an 
Ounce; Seeds of Citrons, Hart-Wort, and Treacle- 
Mustard, each one Ounce; of the Flowers of 
Marrigolds and Rosemary each one Handful; Cin- 
namon two Drams; of French Brandy two Pints; 
and distil off six Pints. 

The Carduus Seeds, and the Carduus Wa- 
ter are in this omitted as insignificant, the rest 
continuing much as before, and is designed to 
use as the Treacle Water, when that proves de- 
ficient in Seasons not fit to make it. 

[}Aqua Limacum Tenuis. }]
[}A small Snail Water. }]
Take of the Leaves of Baum, Mint, Harts- 
Tongue, and Ground-Ivy, of the Flowers of Arch- 
angel, Mallows, and Elder, each one Handful; of 
Snails washed, and the white of Eggs each four 
Ounces; of Nutmegs half an Ounce; and of Cows 
Milk one Gallon; distil according to Art, either 
in B. M. or a Sand-Heat. 

If this be drawn with six Pints of Cows Milk, 
and two Pints of Canary, it is titled the stronger 
Snail Water. 

This very much differs from any before or- 
dered in the old Dispensatory; all the Ingre- 
diants are easily produced, when the Snails are 
in Season; and the Water may be made either 
way, without much Trouble, Care being taken 
to prevent an Empyreuma. 

|P_13
[}Aqua Lactis Alexiteria. }]
[}Alexiterial Milk Water. }]
Take of the Leaves of Meadow-Sweet, Car- 
duus B. and Goats-Rue each six Handsful; of 
Mint and Wormwood each five Handsful; of Rue 
three Handsful; of Angelica two Handsful. Pour 
three Gallons of new Milk upon the Ingredients 
when bruised; and distil in B. M. or a Sand- 
Heat. 

The Ingredients in this are the same as in the 
former, but the Quantities somewhat altered. 

[}Aqua Cinnamomi Tenuis. }]
[}Small Cinnamon Water. }]
Take eight Pints of Spring Water, and twelve 
Ounces of Cinnamon bruised: infuse, and draw 
off with an Alembick. 

[}Aqua Cinnamomi Fortis. }]
[}Strong Cinnamon Water. }]
Take one Pound of Cinnamon grosly powdered, 
and one Gallon of French Brandy: draw off by 
Distillation ten Pints. 

The former of these is not in the old Dispen- 
satory, but somewhat like it ordered in that of 
Bates: and the latter is before under the Title of 
Spirit of Cinnamon. 

[}Aqua Nephritica. }]
[}Water against the Stone. }]
Take of the best Flowers of White-Thorn four 
Pounds; of Nutmegs bruised three Ounces: infuse 
|P_14
them together in a close Vessel, with two Gallons 
of generous White-Wine, and draw off by Distilla- 
tion twelve Pints. 

This was much prescribed by the late Dr. Rad- 
cliffe, but not in the former Dispensatory. 

[}Aqua Fl. Chamæmeli Composita. }]
[}Compound Chamomile-Flower Water. }]
Take of dried Chamomile-Flowers one Pound; 
of the outer Peel of Oranges two Ounces; of the 
Leaves of common Wormwood, and Peneroyal 
each two Handsful; of the Seeds of Anise, Cum- 
min, and sweet Fenil, of the Berries of Bay, and 
Juniper each one Ounce; infuse them in one Gal- 
lon of French Brandy, and draw off double that 
Quantity by Distillation. 

This is not so troublesome by much as the 
former Water under the same Title in the old 
Dispensatory; and the Ingredients are much 
more justly suited to the Intention of a Carmi- 
native, for which it is chiefly designed. 

Under this Division of Waters; are left out 
of what were in the former Dispensatory, the 
Aqua Bezoartica, Cœlestis, Hungarica, Lumbri- 
corum Magistralis, Mariæ, Papaveris Composita, 
Scordii Composita, and Terebinthina; and herein 
is added the Aqua Nephritica, and Cinnamomi; 
some also stand here under the Title of Waters 
which before were in the Division of Spirits, as 
the Spiritus Absinthii magis Compositus, and the 
Spiritus Angelicæ Comp. Spiritus cinnamomi, &c. 
Some Compositions also under the Title of Spirits 
before, are here wholly rejected, as the Spiritus 
Aurantiorum, &c. 

|P_15
And one general Amendment is made in all 
distilled Compound Waters, in ordering French
Brandy instead of Wine, unless in two or three, 
where the Reason for not doing it is very ob- 
vious. For when the Wine comes to be drawn 
over in a Quantity only that leaves it equivalent 
to the Strength of a Standard-Spirit, it is the 
same as if a suitable Quantity of Spirit had been 
put into the Still in its Room; but where the 
Composition is designed for any Intention that 
requires it to be small and soft, Wine, especially 
Canary, may better be accommodated thereunto. 
In short, through the whole of this Class the Con- 
veniency, Elegance, and Efficacy of each Com- 
position are much better studied than in the old 
Dispensatory, and many useless Medicines whol- 
ly rejected. 
[^A floral ornament in the middle of the page. ^]
|P_16[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}AQUÆ MEDICAMENTOSÆ. }]
[}Medicated Waters for External Uses. }]
[}Aqua calcis. }]
[}Lime Water. }]
Take one Pound of Quicklime, and pour upon 
it twelve Pints of boiling Water: After the Ebul- 
lition ceases, and the Lime is settled to the bot- 
tom, pour off the clear for Use. 

This is kept in readiness for various Uses, both 
internal and external. 

[}Aqua Styptica Camphorata. }]
[}Camphorated Styptick Water. }]
Take of Camphorated Vitriol one Ounce; steep 
it in three Pints of Spring Water, and let it stand 
till the Fæces are fallen to the bottom. 

[}Aqua Sapphirina. }]
[}Sapphire coloured Water. }]
Take one Pint of Lime Water, of Sal Armo- 
niac one Dram and an half: Let them be dissol- 
ved together, and then stand in a Brass Bason till 
the Liquor becomes tinged of a Sapphire Colour. 

[}Aqua Aluminosa. }]
[}Alum Water. }]
Take of Red-rose and Plantain water, each one 
Pint; of White Sublimate and Rock-Alum, each 
two drams: Let the Alum and Sublimate be 
rubbed together, and be both boiled with the Wa- 
ters, in a Glass Vessel having a narrow Neck, to 
|P_17
the Consumption of half the Quantity; and after 
Five Days, when the Fæces are settled, pour off 
the clear for use. 

These are chiefly for External Uses, and most 
commonly come under the Direction of a Sur- 
geon, in Ulcers and Cutaneous Eruptions. The 
Steam of Alum-water when boiling, is care- 
fully to be avoided by the Operator, because it 
may have bad Effects from its poisonous Qua- 
lities. It have first prescribed by Fallopius, 
Chap. 93. De Morbo Gallico. 
[^An ornamental picture of Cupid in the middle of the page. ^]
|P_18[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}TINCTURÆ. }]
[}Tinctures. }]
[}Tinctura croci. }]
[}Tincture of Saffron. }]
Take half an Ounce of the best Saffron, digest 
it six Days in eight Ounces of Treacle Wa- 
ter, and strain it for use. 

It also otherwise made with Canary and French
Brandy. 

In the two latter Menstruums the Saffron pre- 
serves its Tincture best, because any thing acid 
soon fades it, although here it is ordered in dou- 
ble the Quantity to what was in the former 
Dispensatory. 

[}Tinctura Castorei. }]
[}Tincture of Castor. }]
Take of Russia Castor powered half an Ounce, 
and let it stand in cold Digestion, in half a Pint 
of the Spirit of Russia Castor, for ten Days; and 
then strain it for use. 

The Proportions here are exactly as in the 
former, though in half their Quantities only, 
of what they were before ordered. 

[}Tinctura Papaveris Composita. }]
[}Compound Tincture of Poppies. }]
Take of the wild Poppy-Flowers one Pound, 
of Nutmegs sliced three Drams, of white Sugar 
|P_19
two Ounces, of French Brandy four Pounds. Draw 
out the Tincture by a gentle Heat. 

This was before ordered to be distilled, but 
remains in the Tincture with much greater Effi- 
cacy, is as grateful to the Palate as when in a 
Water, and more beautiful to the Eye. 

[}Tinctura Theriacalis. }]
[}The Alexipharmick Tincture. }]
Take of French Brandy, and the best Vinegar, 
each two Pounds, of Venice Treacle and Mithri- 
date, each half a Pound; digest them in a gentle 
Heat, and strain out the Tincture for use. 

This was not received by the College until 
the Publication of the last Dispensatory before 
the present; and it is here altered from that, on- 
ly in substituting a French Spirit instead of the 
Wine, wherein Rue-Seeds had been distilled; 
which was a Trouble without any Proportionable 
Advantage. 

[}Tinctura Viridis. }]
[}The Green Tincture. }]
Take of Verdigrease half an Ounce, of yellow 
Arsenick six Drams, of Alum three Drams. Boil 
them together in one Pint of white Wine to the 
Consumption of half the Quantity; and, after it 
is cold, add to it of Rose and Plantain-Water, 
each six Ounces. 

This likewise hath not been received by the 
College, until the Dispensatory before the pre- 
sent, and in that Nightshade Water was ordered, 
where Plantain is here substituted, because that 
|P_20
is not now directed to be made amongst the 
simple Waters. 

[}Tinctura Cantharidum. }]
[}Tincture of Cantharides. }]
Take of Rhubarb three Drams, of Gum-Guai- 
cum one Dram and an half; of Gum-Lac one 
Dram, of Cantharides bruised two Drams, of Co- 
chineel half a Dram; infuse in a Pint and half of 
rectified Spirit of Wine; and strain for use. 

This was never before in the College Dis- 
pensatory; and has the Reputation of a very 
great Physician now living for its first Contri- 
ver. The Digestion may be forwarded by a 
slow Heat in a close Vessel, though it is not par- 
ticularly so ordered. 

[}Tinctura Myrrhæ. }]
[}Tincture of Myrrh. }]
Take of Myrrh half an Ounce, of Salt of Tar- 
tar two Drams; mix them well together, and put 
them into a moist Place for a Week; then add to 
them eight Ounces of rectified Spirit, and draw 
out the Tincture by a gentle Heat. 

This was not before ordered but by Bates. 
The Salt of Tartar is directed to lie with the 
Myrrh in a moist Place, because the Air 
dissolves it so into the Body of the Gum, that 
when it comes into the Spirit it much sooner 
gives its Tincture than it otherwise would do. 

[}Tinctura Myrrhæ Composita. }]
[}Compound Tincture of Myrrh. }]
Take of the best Aloes, and Myrrh, each one 
Ounce, of French Brandy one Pint, digest and 
strain for use. 

|P_21
This is exactly as in the former. 

[}Tinctura Sulphuris. }]
[}Tinctura of Sulphur. }]
Take of the Liver of Sulphur two Ounces; of 
French Brandy one Pint; digest and strain the 
Tincture. This may also be drawn with Spirit 
from the Terebinthinated Balsam of Sulphur, boiled 
to a Dryness in a Bath-Heat. 

This was not in any former Dispensatory of 
the College, and is ordered for its greater Con- 
veniency of taking , than the Balsams of Sul- 
phur, because they will not so readily mix 
with any small Vehicles. It is indeed amongst 
Shipton's Additamenta, with some small Varia- 
tions of no great Moment; for there is ordered 
Salt of Tartar, which seems needless, because 
there is a Sufficiency of that already in the Liver 
of Sulphur to dispose it to a ready Solution in the 
Menstruum. 

[}Laudanum Liquidum Sydenhami. }]
[}Sydenham's Liquid Laudanum. }]
Take of Opium two Ounces; of Saffron one 
Ounce; of Cinnamon and Cloves, each one 
Dram; of Canary sixteen Ounces: Digest these 
together in a Bath Heat for three Days; and when 
the Fæces are settled, pour it off for use. 

This was not before receive into the Col- 
lege Dispensatory, its Invention being since the 
Publication of the last; but it hath commonly 
been ordered in Practice. 

|P_24
[}Elixir Salutis. }]
[}Elixir of Health. }]
Take of Sena Leaves cleared of their Stalks four 
Ounces; of Guajacum Chips, of dry'd Elicampane 
Root, of the Seed of Anise, Caraway, Coriander, 
and of Liquorice Root, each two Ounces; of Rai- 
sons stoned eight Ounces; of French Brandy six 
Pints. Steep them together cold for four Days, 
and then strain out the Spirit for use. 

This is in Shipton's Additamenta, where he 
says, that some likewise add Salt of Tatar, 
Rhubarb, Scammony, Jallap, &c. in order to 
make it operate more briskly; for, as here di- 
rected, the purgative Ingredient, which is the 
Sena only, bears so small a proportion to the 
Quantity of Spirit, in a Dose sufficient for a 
Purge, that it is too strong for most Persons 
who have not been accustomed to spirituous Li- 
quors. It therefore is now to be deemed rather 
a Carminative than a Cathartic; and in some 
Cholic Pains it gives great Relief as such. 

[}Tinctura Rhabarbari. }]
[}Tincture of Rhubarb. }]
Take of Rhubarb one Ounce and an half; of 
the lesser Cardamom Seeds, and Saffron, each two 
Drams; of Liquorice Root half an Ounce; of 
French Brandy one Pint, and make into a Tinc- 
ture. 

This is ordered by Bates, with some Variati- 
ons, but not before now received by the Col- 
lege, tho' they have considerably amended it, 
and particularly in throwing out the Sugar- 
|P_25
Candy and stoned Raisons, which have nothing 
to do with the main Intention of the Medi- 
cine. 

[}Tinctura Hellebori. }]
[}Tincture of Hellebore. }]
Take of black Hellebore Root two Ounces; of 
Salt of Tartar one Dram; of Cochineel one Scu- 
ple; of French Brandy one Pint: Draw out the 
Tincture by a warm Heat. 

This is a much more simple Medicine than 
the Tinctura Melampodii in Bates, and is much 
more efficacious, there being nothing to be de- 
pended upon but the Hellebore. The Salt of 
Tartar is added, as in many other Tinctures, to 
open the Root, and make it give a Tincture the 
more freely; for lixivial Salts greatly break and 
divide all adhesive, viscid, and resinous Sub- 
stances. 

[}Spiritus Vini Camphoratus. }]
[}Camphorated Spirit of Wine. }]
Take of rectified Spirit of Wine one Pint; of 
Camphire one Ounce, and mix them together. 

The Camphire will soon melt in the Spirit, 
like Sugar in Water. It is ordered by Bates
with the same Quantity of Camphire, and but 
half so much Spirit. It is chiefly used exter- 
nally. 

Under this Form are added several Medicines 
not before directed by the College; and such as 
better preserve the Virtues of the Ingredients, 
than if continued in any other manner: Be- 
|P_26
sides the greater Elegance of the Medicines, 
and more Convenience of taking, particularly 
in the Tinctura Papaveris Composita, which was 
before distilled; and in the Tinctura Sulphuris, 
before ordered with oily Menstruums into a 
Balsam, which made it very nauseous to take. 
[^An ornamental picture of a fountain in the middle of the page. ^]
|P_27[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}VINA MEDICATA. }]
[}Medicated Wines. }]
[}Vinum Benedictum. }]
[}The blessed wine. }]
Take of the Crocus of Metals powdered one 
Ounce; of Canary one Pint and an half; let them 
infuse together a sufficient time, and then strain off 
the clear Wine. 

In that of the former Dispensatory there was 
ordered one Dram of Mace, which is here just- 
ly rejected as having nothing to do with the In- 
tention of a Vomit. 

[}Vinum Chalybeatum. }]
[}Steel Wine. }]
Take of the Filings of Steel one Ounce; of 
Saffron on Powder two Drams; of Mountain Wine 
one Pint: Infuse them together cold for three Days, 
stirring them often during that time, and and then strain 
it for use. 

The Saffron in the former Dispensatory was 
in so trifling a Quantity as eight Grains, and 
therefore very justly amended in this: A stron- 
ger sort of Wine is likewise here ordered, be- 
cause if it be too small it acquires a Sharpness, e- 
specially in hot Weather, and makes the Medi- 
cine very nauseous to the Stomach. 

|P_28
[}Vinum Scilliticum. }]
[}Squill Wine. }]
Take one Pound of white Squills divided and 
dried; put them into a Glass Vessel, and pour up- 
on them of old French white Wine eight Pints; 
let them macerate fourteen Days, and then strain 
off the Wine for use. 

This was before ordered to stand in Infusion 
double the time, which was liable to dissolve 
the Squills so much as to make the Wine too 
slimy for use. 

[}Vinum Viperinum. }]
[}Viper Wine. }]
Take of dried Vipers cut into pieces No. six; 
digest them three Days with a gentle Heat in two 
Pints of Canaryl, and then strain out the Wine 
for use. 

This was not before in any Dispensatory of 
the College, but added to the last by Shipton in 
his Appendix; but there it is directed with Live- 
Vipers, and the Quantity of Wine triple to what 
it is here. 

There are many Medicines under this Class 
in the old Dispensatory that are here rejected, as 
the Vinum Absinthites, Anthosatum, Cerasorum 
Nigr. Elleboratum, &c. and certainly with good 
reason; because their Intentions are much better 
provided for in other Forms more suitable to the 
Nature of the Ingredients, and more convenient 
for taking. 

|P_29[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}ACETA MEDICATA. }]
[}Medicated Vinegars. }]
[}Acetum Distillatum. }]
[}Distilled Vinegar. }]
Take enough of the best Vinegar to fill two 
thirds of a Retort, which place in warm Ashes, 
and distil first with a moderate Heat, to bring o- 
ver the Phlegm; then increase the Fire by degrees 
so as to finish the Operation with a strong Heat. 

This is directed for the Treacle Water, which 
in the former Dispensatories was injudiciously di- 
rected to be drawn off among the other Ingre- 
dients; as may be seen in the Notes thereupon. 

[}Acetum Scilliticum. }]
[}Vinegar of Squills. }]
Take that part of the Squills between the outer 
Leaves and the Core, cut it into small pieces, which 
cleanse and expose to Heat for thirty Days; and put 
one Pound of it into a Bottle with six Pints of the 
best Vinegar; and in the Summer time let the 
Vessel, close stopped, be placed in the Sun for thirty 
Days; then open it, and strain it out for use. 

This is sometimes used of itself, but chiefly 
made into Oxymel Scilliticum. 

There are a great many medicated Vinegars be- 
fore ordered, which are left out here as useless, and 
quite out of the common extemporary Prescrip- 
tions. 

|P_30[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}DECOCTA, INFUSA, & SYRUPI. }]
[}Decoctions, Infusions, and Syrups. }]
[}Decoctum Commune Pro Clystere. }]
[}Common Decoction for Clysters. }]
Take of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, Pelli- 
tory of the Wall, Beets, and Mercury, each one 
handful; of Chamomile Flowers two Pugils; of 
Sweet Fenile Seed half an Ounce; of Linseed two 
Drams; and boil them in a sufficient Quantity of 
common Water to strain off one Pint. 

All these Ingredients so well agree in the their ge- 
neral Intention, that they are retained exactly 
as before, and in the same Quantities. 

[}Decoctum Epithymi. }]
[}Decoction of Dodder of Thyme. }]
Take of the Chebulan, and Indian Myrobolans, 
each half an Ounces; of Arabian Stœchas and Sena, 
each one Ounce; of Fumitory half an Ounce; of 
Euphatorium five Drams; of Polypody of the Oak 
six Drams; of Turpeth Root half an Ounce; of 
Spring Water four Pints. Boil all together to two 
Pints, and then add of the Dodder of Thyme and 
stoned Raisons, each one Ounces; and give them 
another Boil together. When taken from the Fire, 
add of Black Hellebore Root; of Agaric, and Salt 
of Tartar, each half an Ounce. Let them stand 
in Infusion together ten Hours, and then Press out 
the Liquor. 

|P_31
This differs from the former chiefly in the 
Proportions of the Ingredients, the last three be- 
ing greatly enlarged in their Quantities, and Salt 
of Tartar put in the room of the Sal Gem. But 
it is seldom prescribed, that very few, if any, 
are accustomed to keep it by them. 

[}Decoctum Pectorale. }]
[}Pectoral Decoction. }]
Take of Raisons stoned one Ounce; of Dactyls 
No. six; of fat Figs No. eight; of Barley cleansed 
one Ounce. Boil these in three Pints of Spring 
Water to the Consumption of a third Part; to- 
ward the end putting in of Liquorice Root half 
an Ounce; of the Leaves of Maiden-Hair, Ground- 
Ivy, Scabius, an Coltsfoot, each one handful: Let 
them stand in Infusion a quarter of an Hour, and 
then strain out the Liquor. 

This differs from the former in ordering those 
Ingredients which want the least boiling to be 
put in at last: In substituting Ground-Ivy in- 
stead of Hyssop, which was too hot for the ge- 
neral Intention of the Medicine, especially in 
hectick Constitutions, where it is often wanted; 
and in rejecting the Jujebs, and Sebestians, which 
were certainly needless, and loaded the Medicine 
with Ingredients to no purpose. 

[}Decoctum Traumaticum. }]
[}The Vulnerary Decoction. }]
Take of Sarsaparilla two Ounces; of the grea- 
ter Comfrey, and Liquorice Roots, each six Drams; 
of white Dittany two Drams; of stoned Raisons 
two Ounces; of the Shaveings of Hartshorn half 
|P_32
an Ounce. Boil in a sufficient Quantity of Spring 
Water to strain off four Pints; adding towards the 
latter end, of the Leaves of St. John's Wort, Agri- 
mony, Plantain, and Ground-Ivy, each half an 
handful; of the Flowers of the greater Daisy one 
handful; of Nettle Seed two Drams; and strain 
out the Liquor for use. 

This is greatly different from the former, and 
rejects a great many useless Ingredients, with 
which that was crowded. 

[}Lac Virginale. }]
[}Virgin's Milk. }]
Take of Rock Alum four Ounces, and boil it in 
Spring Water till a third part is consumed: Then 
take of Litharge of Gold half a Pound; of the 
best White Wine Vinegar a Pint and an half, and 
boil again to one Pint; then strain both, and shake 
them together until they incorporate into a white 
Mixture. 

This is exactly as in the old Dispensatory, and 
is solely for external Uses. 

Under this form is left out only what was in 
the former Dispensatory, the Decoctum Senæ Ge- 
reonis, which was a very injudicious Compositi- 
on; and the Decoctum Amarum, which is also 
much better supplied in the next Class of Infu- 
sions. 

|P_33[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}INFUSA. }]
[}Infusions. }]
[}Infusum Amarum Simplex. }]
[}The Simple Bitter Infusion. }]
Take of Gentian Root, and Galangals, each one 
Dram; of the Tops of Roman Wormwood two 
Drams; of the outer Peel of Sevil Oranges dryed, 
and of the lesser Cardamon Seeds, each one Dram. 
Infuse them in one Pint of boiling Water, and 
when it is cold strain out for use. 

This is greatly preferable to what was before 
ordered both for Neatness and Efficacy. 

[}Infusum Amarum Solutivum. }]
[}The Opening Bitter Infusion. }]
Take of the Tops of the lesser Centaury, of 
Chamomile Flowers, each one Pugil; of Gentian 
Root half a Scruple; of Rhubarb one Dram; of 
Sena Leaves picked from Stalks, and Carduus Seeds, 
each one Dram; of the lesser Cardamoms half a 
Dram: Pour upon them five Ounces of boiling 
Water, and strain it when cold. 

This is also greatly mended, to any before or- 
dered, on the same accounts as the foregoing. 

|P_34
[}Infusum Senæ. }]
[}The Infusion of Sena. }]
Take of Alexandrian Sena one Ounce and an 
half; of the lesser Cardamom Seeds two Drams; 
of Salt of Tartar three Drams: Pour upon them 
one Pint of boiling Water, and strain out when 
cold. 

This is geatly preferable to the usual Decoc- 
tum Gereonis, now rejected; tho' some who va- 
lue the Salt of Tartar only as it strikes as Colour, 
and beautifies a Tincture, or helps to open the 
Ingredients, for which purpose it is frequently 
ordered, think the Quantity herein an over Pro- 
portion: But such are to consider that it is here 
directed as a purging Ingredient; and that as 
such it hath frequently been ordered by the most 
eminent in Practice, and particularly by Riverius, 
who prefers it to the Cream of Tartar as a Ca- 
thartic. 

There hath not been any Forms under this 
Denomination in any preceding Dispensatory of 
the College; those few that are here ordered 
being before under the Title of Decoctions; 
which is an improper way of Management for 
such Ingredients, is sufficient to draw out the Vir- 
tues that are required; whereas in boiling they 
would in a great measure be lost, and particu- 
larly by the Evaporation of all the volatile and 
aromatic Parts. This Form is indeed much 
used in extemporaneous Prescriptions, as very 
suitable to that dispatch which Cases that call 
for them may require: But it is not well fitted 
|P_35
for keeping in Readiness, as most of the offici- 
nal Compositions, because such Medicines will 
soon decay, especially in warm Wheather; tho' 
there is little occasion for being so prepared be- 
forehand, because they are very quickly made. 
[^A floral ornament in the middle of the page. ^]

[}SYRUPI. }]
[}Syrups. }]
[}SYRUPI ALTERANTES. }]
[}Alterant Syrups. }]
[}Syrupus de Absinthio Simplex. }]
[}The simple Syrup of Wormwood. }]
Take of the clarified Juice of common Worm- 
wood, and of clarified Sugar, each four Pints, 
and boil them together into the Consistency of a 
Syrup. 

After the same manner are prepared the Simple 
Syrup of the Juice of Succory, of Ground Ivy, 
of Raspberries, of the outer Peel of Walnuts, of 
Coltsfoot; and also of other Juises that are not 
acid. 

This Syrup hath hitherto been but little, if e- 
ver made, although directed in the former Dis- 
pensatory, yet in none of the College before 
that, because it is hardly ever ordered in extem- 
poraneous Prescriptions, and not in any officinal 
Medicine but the Pil. Ruffi; and that hath been 
accustomed chiefly to be made up with Syrup 
of Lemons, or some other pale Syrup, for the 
sake of preserving the beautiful yellow of the In- 
gredients, which the Goodness and Freshness of 
the Medicine is mostly judged by, and which is 
|P_37
much spoiled by a brown Syrup: But such a 
Nicety ought not to take place of a more im- 
portant Quality; and that is the Intention of the 
Medicine, which is undoubtedly better preser- 
ved by a use of what the College hath here or- 
dered: Not to say any thing of the Obligati- 
ons on many accounts that every Composer lies 
under punctually to conform to the Prescrip- 
tion. 

[}Syrupus de Absinthio Compositus. }]
[}Compound Syrup of Wormwood. }]
Take of common Wormwood moderately dried 
half a Pound; of Red Rose Leaves two Ounces; 
of Spikenard three Drams; of old strong White 
Wine, and Juice of Quinces, each two Pints and 
an half: Let them infuse together warm in an 
earthen Vessel for a whole Day, then gently boil 
in a Bath Heat, and strain out the Liquor; and 
with two Pound of white Sugar boil it up to the 
Consistence of a Syrup, S. A.

This is as old as Mesue, whose Prescription it 
orginally was, and is exactly the same as in the 
preceding Dispensatories: But of late it is so 
seldom used in extemporaneous Prescriptions, 
that it is hardly ever to be met with in the 
Shops. 

[}Syrupus Acetosus. }]
[}Syrup of Vinegar. }]
Take five Pound of fine Sugar, and of White 
Wine Vinegar two Pound: Let the Sugar be melt- 
ed in a hot water Bath, so as to make them into 
a Syrup, S. A.

|P_38
This is exactly as before directed, where there 
is also a compound Syrup of Vinegar; but here 
justly rejected as not worth making. 

[}Syrupus de Althæa. }]
[}Syrup of Marshmallows. }]
Take of Marshmallow Root two Ounces; of 
Grass, Asparagus, and Liquorice Roots cleansed, 
and of stoned Raisons, each half an Ounce; of 
the Leaves of Marshmallows, common Mallows, 
Pellitory of the Wall, Saxifrage, Pimpinel, Plan- 
tain, and the white and the black Hellebore, each one 
handful; of red Cicers one Ounce; of the four 
greater and lesser cold Seeds, each three Drams. 
Infuse them for a whole Day in six Pints of Wa- 
ter; then boil it to four Pints; to which when 
pressed out and strained, add three Pounds and an 
half of white Sugar, and boil up to a Syrup in a 
Bath Heat, S. A.

This Syrup is orginally ascribed to Fernelius, 
and has remained unaltered in all the College Dis- 
pensatories. If it is not boiled up to a good Con- 
sistence, it is so apt to ferment in warm Wea- 
ther, that makes it very troublesome to keep. 

[}Syrupus de Artemisia. }]
[}Syrup of Mugwort. }]
Take of Mugwort two Handsful; of Pene- 
royal, Calaminth, Origany, Baum, Dittany of 
Crete, Savin, Margoram, the lesser Centaury, and 
Rue, each one handful; of Fenile, Smallage, and 
Parsly Roots, each one Ounce; of Juniper Ber- 
ries, of the Seeds of Lovage, Parsly, Smallage, 
Cubebs, and the Roots of Asarum, each half an 
|P_39
Ounce. Let these be cleansed, cut and bruised, as 
they require, and boil them in twelve Pints of Wa- 
ter to eight Pints. To the expressed Liquor, add 
of Cinnamon, and Spikenard, each three Drams; 
of white Sugar six Pound, and boil up to a Sy- 
rup, S. A.

This hath thrown out abundance of insig- 
nificant and troublesome Ingredients which were 
formerly crowded into it: It hath also rejected 
the needless Labour of a Distillation, and left 
the Virtues of the Ingredients much better in a 
Decoction, which is in every respect as well fit- 
ted for the Form of a Syrup, as if made from 
the Water distilled. 

[}Syrupus de Berberis. }]
[}Syrup of Berberies. }]
Take two Pints of the fine Juice of Berberies, 
and one Pound and an half of very fine Sugar: Boil 
them in an earthen glased Vessel to the Consistence 
of a Syrup. 

This, as all acid Syrups, requires a very leisure- 
ly Heat to melt the Sugar; for hasty and much 
boiling not only hurts the Pungency of the acid, 
but also subjects the Medicine to run into a Can- 
dy. It is ordered in a glased earthen Vessel, be- 
cause such Juices are apt to erode, and take up 
part of any Metal they are put into. 

[}Syrupus Capillorum Veneris. }]
[}Syrup of Maiden-Hair. }]
Take of Maiden-Hair five Ounces; of Liquo- 
rice Root two Ounces: Infuse them for twenty 
four Hours in six Pints of hot Water; then after 
|P_40
a gentle Boiling in a Bath Heat, press out the Li- 
quor; and four Pints of it clarified, put of fine 
Sugar three Pounds, and boil up to a Syrup, S. A.

This remains exactly as before directed. 

[}Syrupus Infusionis Fl. Caryophyllorum. }]
[}Syrup of the Infusion of Clove-Gillyflowers. }]
Take of Clove-Gillyflowers, with the white 
Heels cut off, one Pound; let them steep a whole 
Night in two Pints of Spring Water; then strain 
the Liquor, and boil it up into a Syrup in a Bath 
Heat with two Pounds on the finest Sugar, S. A.

Double the Quantity of Sugar to the same 
Quantity of Flowers and Water was before or- 
dered, which was sufficient to give the Consist- 
ency of a Syrup as soon as dissolved: But this re- 
quires so much boiling before it comes to that 
Body, that great care must be taken not to spoil 
the Beauty of its Colour, which two hasty an 
Heat will easily do. 

[}Syrupus de Cinnamomo. }]
[}Syrup of Cinnamon. }]
Take of the best Cinnamon, a little bruised, 
three Ounces; infuse it for three Days in a suffici- 
ent Quantity of hot Spring Water to strain off a 
Pint, and put to it half a Pound of the finest Su- 
gar; and with a gentle Heat boil it up to a Sy- 
rup. 

After the same manner, only with White Wine 
instead of Water, Syrups may be made of the Seeds 
of Anise, of Sweet Fenile, of the Clove Spice, of 
Nutmegs, of Ginger, &c.

|P_41
All these were before ordered into Syrups, 
and they well enough suit the Form, provided 
the Heat made use of is not hasty enough to ex- 
hale the volatile Parts, which it will do without 
great care. 

[}Syrupus è Succo Citriorum. }]
[}Syrup of the Juice of Citrons. }]
Take one Pint of the clear Juice of Citrons; of 
fine Sugar two Pounds; and boil into a Syrup 
with a gentle Fire. 

After the same manner are made the Syrup of 
wild Apples, Oranges, Berberries, Cherries, Quin- 
ces, Lemons, Woodsorrel, Mulberries, Goosber- 
ries, and other clarified acid Juices. 

But in all these the same Cautions are to be 
used as before hinted in the Note under Syrup 
of Berries. 

[}Syrupus Corticum Citriorum. }]
[}Syrup of Citron Peels. }]
Take five Ounces of the outer yellow Citron 
Peel, full ripe and fresh; of Kermes Berries, or 
in their stead, of the imported Juice two Drams; 
of Spring Water three Pints: Steep them toge- 
ther for one Night in a Bath Heat; and to the 
strained Liquor put two Pounds and an half of fine 
Sugar; and with a moderate Heat boil up into the 
Consistence of a Syrup. 

After the same manner are prepared Syrups from 
the Peels af Oranges, and Lemons. 

But care must be taken that with two hasty 
an Heat the aromatick Flavour be not evapora- 
|P_42
ted. This is as old as Mesue, and in some for- 
mer Dispensatories it was ordered to be scented 
with some Grains of Musk; but that is here 
justly rejected, as what will agree but with very 
few Persons. 

[}Syrupus Cydoniorum. }]
[}Syrup of Quinces. }]
Take six Pints of the clear Juice of Quinces; 
boil it gently till half is evaporated, and at times 
take off the Scum that rises upon it; then put to 
it three Pints of red astringent Wine, and of fine 
Sugar four Pound; which boil into a Syrup, that 
may be aromatized with Cinnamon one Dram and 
an half; of Cloves and Ginger, each two Scru- 
ples. 

This hath also Mesue for its Author, and hath 
been retained in all the Dispensatories of the Col- 
lege; tho' the preceding to this gives the liber- 
ty of making it with one Pint of the Juice of 
Quinces only, and two Pounds of Sugar, and 
only melting them together, as the other sub-acid 
and austere Syrups; and that way the Shops 
have been of late most accustomed to make it. 

[}Syrupus de Erysimo. }]
[}Syrup of Hedge Mustard. }]
Take of Hedge Mustard fresh gathered six hands- 
ful; of Elicampane Root, and Coltsfoot, also very 
fresh gathered, and Liquorice Root, each two 
Ounces; of the Leaves of Borrage, of Succory, 
and Maiden-Hair, each an Ounce an an half; of 
the Cordial Flowers, and the Flowers of Rosema- 
ry and Betony, each half an handful; of Aniseeds 
half an Ounce; of stoned Raisons two Ounces: 
|P_43
Let them infuse together a whole Day in Water 
and Mead, of each two Pints and an half; of the 
Juice of Hedge Mustard eight Ounces. Boil them 
in a Bath Heat; and to the Liquor strongly pres- 
sed out and clarified, put four Pounds and an half 
of Loaf Sugar, and boil to a Syrup in the same 
Heat, S. A.

This was not in the first of our College Dis- 
pensatories, although received into the prece- 
ding, and yet continued: Nor hath it been the 
Custom to provide it by the Shops, because so 
seldom, if ever, ordered in extemporanous Pre- 
scriptions. It is a Composition originally of Lo-
belius, who had a strange Opinion of the Ingre- 
dient from whence it takes its Name; and he 
seemed most to value it as a powerful detergent, 
and pectoral. 

[}Syrupus de Glycyrrhiza. }]
[}Syrup of Liquorice. }]
Take of fresh Liquorice, cleansed and bruised, 
two Ounces; of white Maiden-Hair one Ounce; 
of Hyssop half an Ounce: Pour upon these three 
Pints of boiling Spring Water; and after twenty 
four Hours Infusion in a Bath Heat, strain out the 
Liquor, and clarify it; and with the best Honey 
and fine Sugar, of each ten Ounces, boil it up to 
a Syrup in a Bath Heat, S. A.

This was a Contrivance of Mesue, and conti- 
nued in all the Collage Dispensatories without 
Alteration. 

|P_44
[}Syrupus Granatorum. }]
[}Syrup of Pomgranates. }]
Take of white Sugar one Pound and an half; of 
the Juice of Pomegranates made fine one Pint: Let 
it be made into a Syrup with a Bath Heat, S. A.

This requires the same Caution as the acid 
and sub-astringent Syrups before-mentioned. 

[}Syrupus de Meconio, sive Diacodion. }]
[}Syrup of Poppies, or Diacodium. }]
Take of white Poppy Heads well dried fourteen 
Ounces; and after twenty four Hours Infusion in 
eight Pints of Spring Water, boil them well; and 
to the expressed Liquor, put twenty four Ounces 
of Sugar, to be boiled into a Syrup. 

This is altered from the former both in re- 
jecting the black Poppies, and in the Propor- 
tions; the white here answering to the Quan- 
tities of both before. This Syrup will not bear 
the usual way of Clarification, without losing 
much of its Strength as an Opiate. And such 
difference will happen on one account or other 
with the utmost Care, as renders it difficult to 
be made always of the same strength. 

[}Syrupus de Mentha. }]
[}Syrup of Mint. }]
Take of the Juice of sweet and sub-acid Quin- 
ces, and of the Juice of sweet and acid Pomgra- 
nates, each one Pint and an half; of dried Mint 
half a Pound; of red Roses two Ounces: Let 
them strand in Maceration one whole Day; then 
|P_45
boil in a Bath Heat to half its Consumption, strain 
the Liquors, and with four Pounds of Sugar make 
it into a Syrup. 

This is old as Mesue, and hath been continu- 
ed by the College in their Dispensatories with- 
out Alteration, excepting that in the last is left 
out the Directions for aromatizing it with Nut- 
megs, as was at first ordered. The dried Mint 
imbibes so much of the Juices, that it requires a 
strong Expression to get out the Quantity requi- 
red with but very little boiling. 

[}Syrupus Myrtinus. }]
[}Syrup of Myrtles. }]
Take of Myrtle Berries two Ounces and an half; 
of the white and red Sanders, of Sumach, of Ba- 
laustins, Berberries, and red Roses, each an Ounce 
and an half; of Medlars sliced one Pound, bruise 
as required, and boil in eight Pints of Water to 
four Pints; and to that when strained add of the 
acid Juice of Quinces, and Pomegranates, each six 
Ounces: Then with four Pounds of Sugar boil 
into a Syrup; adding the Juice towards the lat- 
ter end. 

This is originally ascribed to Nicolaus, and 
hath been continued by the College without Al- 
terations, exepting in the Addition of one Pound 
of Sugar in the present Orders. 

[}Syrupus de Papavere Erratico. }]
[}Syrup of Wild Poppies. }]
Take of the fresh Flowers of Wild Poppies two 
Pounds, and pour upon them four Pints of hot 
Spring Water. The next Day press it out, and 
|P_46
repeat the Infusion with fresh Flowers, and then 
make it into a Syrup in a Bath Heat, with as much 
Sugar as there is of the strained Liquor. 

This remains exactly as in the foregoing; tho' 
the common Practice of the Shop hath been 
accustomed to make one Infusion only with just 
enough Water to cover and scald the Flowers: 
And it is possible to give it so much from the 
Flowers, as will turn the Syrup roapy and full 
of Clods; continuing them long in Infusion 
will also subject it to the same Faults. 

[}Syrupus de Pomis Alterans. }]
[}The Alterant Syrup of Apples. }]
Take of the Juice of fragrant Apples four Pints; 
of the Leaves of Garden and Wild Bugloss, and of 
Violet Flowers, each one Pound: Boil in a Bath 
Heat, and to the clear strained Liquor put seven 
Pound of the finest Sugar, with one Pint of Da- 
mask Rose Water, and make into a Syrup, S. A.

This hath Fernelius for its first Inventor, and 
is here altered in nothing of any Moment from 
what it was when first received into their Dis- 
pensatory by the College. 

[}Syrupus de Pæonia Compositus. }]
[}Compound Syrup of Pionies. }]
Take of fresh Piony Roots, both the kinds, cut 
into slices, and infused a whole Day in White Wine, 
each an Ounce and an half; of Contrayerva Root 
half an Ounce; of Mountain Osier (Bastard Lo- 
vage) six Drams; of Rosemary with its Flowers 
one handful; of Betony, Hyssop, Origany, Ground 
Pine, and Rue, each three Drams; of Aloes Wood, 
|P_47
Cloves, and the lesser Cardamoms, each two 
Drams; of Ginger and Spikenard, each one 
Dram; of Stœchas and Nutmegs, each two 
Drams and an half. After one Day's Infusion in 
six Pints of warm Spring Water, boil in a Bath 
Heat to the Consumption of a third Part; and to 
the Liquor afterwards strained though a Flannel 
Bag, put four Pounds and an half of the finest Su- 
gar, and boil up into a Syrup with a moderate 
Heat. 

This was ordered before with the distilled 
Water of Piony Roots; but as no such thing 
is now made, common Spring Water is substi- 
tuted, as the other was a needless Trouble. The 
College did not at first receive this Composition 
into their Dispensatory, and I do not remember it 
in any but that immediately preceding this. Ma- 
ny of the Ingredients are liable to Evaporation in 
their best Parts, without a careful and slow Heat 
in every Part of the Process. 

[}Syrupus de Prassio. }]
[}Syrup of Hore-Hound. }]
Take of the Leaves of fresh white Hore-Hound 
two Ounces; of Liquorice, Polypody of the Oak, 
Smallage, and Sweet Fenile Roots, each half an 
Ounce; of the Leaves of white Maiden-Hair, O- 
riganum, Hyssop, Calaminth, Thyme, Scabious, 
Savory, and Coltsfoot, each six Drams; of the 
Seeds of Anise and Quinces, each three Drams; of 
stoned Raison two Ounces; of fat Figs number 
ten: Let these stand in a warm Digestion for a 
a whole Day in eight Pints of thin Mead; then 
boil in a Bath Heat, and to five Pints of the Li- 
quor, strongly pressed out, and settled clear, put 
two Pounds of clarified Honey, and as much fine 
|P_48
Sugar, and boil up to a Syrup; which may be fla- 
voured with one Ounce of Florentine Orrice 
Root. 

This is a Contrivance of Fernelius, and hath 
pass'd through all the College Dispensatories, e- 
ven into this, without any Alterations of moment; 
the Substitution of Quince Seeds for those of 
Cotton being the chief. 

[}Syrupus de Quinque Radicibus. }]
[}Syrup of Five Roots. }]
Take of the Roots of Butchers Broom, Sweet 
Fenile, Asparagus, Parsley, and Smallage, each 
two Ounces; of Spring Water six Pints: Digest 
them together warm, and then boil them in a Bath 
Heat. To four Pints of the Liquor strongly pres- 
sed out and clarified, put five Pound and an half 
of fine Sugar, and make into a Syrup in the same 
Heat, S. A. adding to it at the latter end eight 
Ounces of Vinegar. 

This hath Mesue for its Author; but the first 
Dispensatories of the College put but three 
Pounds of Sugar. It makes a very grateful Sy- 
rup by the help of the Vinegar, and is frequent- 
ly prescribed amongst aperient Pectorals. The 
whole Ingredients are in the preceding Dispen- 
satory to this, ordered under the general Name 
of the five opening Roots; and under which 
common Denomination they are frequently ex- 
press'd by medicinal Writers. 

|P_49
[}Syrupus de Rosis Siccis. }]
[}Syrup of dried Roses. }]
Take four Pints of hot Spring Water, and in it 
infuse half a Pound of Rose Leaves hastily dried in 
the Sun; the next Day press out the Liquor, and 
with two Pounds of Sugar boil it up to a Syrup, 
S. A.

This is ordered so anciently as by Mesue, and 
hath been retained the same in all the Dispen- 
satories of the College. 

[}Syrupus de Stoechade. }]
[}Syrup of Stœchas; or French Lavender. }]
Take of Stœchas Flowers four Ounces; of 
Rosemary Flowers half an Ounce; of the Herbs 
of Thyme, Calaminth, and Origany, each one 
Ounce and an half; of the Seeds of Rue, Piony, 
and Sweet Fennel, each three Drams. Digest these 
one or two Days in a sufficient Quantity of hot Spring 
Water to press out five Pints clear; to which add of 
the finest Sugar five Pounds and an half, and make 
into a Syrup by a Bath Heat according to Art. It 
may be aromatized with some drops of the distilled 
Oil of Cinnamon. 

This is directed by Mesue; but it is here al- 
tered from what it was when first received into 
the College Dispensatory; for there it was to 
be boiled much more, which by no means a- 
grees with volatile spicy Ingredients; there was 
also as much Honey as Sugar, and Ginger, with 
Calammus Aromaticus, besides the Cinnamon di- 
rected to flavour it with at last, by suspending 
|P_50
them in a thin Bag, while the Syrup was boiling 
to a sufficient Consistence. 

[}Syrupus de Symphyto. }]
[}Syrup of Comfrey. }]
Take of the Roots and Leaves of the greater 
and lesser Comfrey, each three handsful; of fresh 
Red Roses, Leaves of Betany, Plantain, Pimper- 
nel, Knot-Grass, Scabious, and Coltsfoot, each 
two handsful. Bruise them; and press out their 
Juice; to each Pound of which put one Pound of 
Sugar; and in the boiling take off what Scum ri- 
ses, until it is of a due Consistence for a Syrup. 

This is a Composition of Fernelius, and is 
continued here as first received by the College, 
unless with a small Variation in the Quantity of 
Sugar. 

[}Syrupus Violarum. }]
[}Syrup of Violets. }]
Take fresh Violet Flowers clean picked one 
Pound, and pour upon them two Pints and an 
half of hot Water: Cover them down close in a 
new earthen glased Pot for a whole Day, and then 
squeeze out the Liquor with a Press; and to every 
Pint of it put two Pounds of fine Sugar, which 
dissolve in a Bath Heat; and take off what Scum 
arises during its Continuance over the Fire. 

This hath heretofore been a syrup in mighty 
Esteem: Most make the Quantity of Water 
just so much as is sufficient to scald the Flow- 
ers, and receive their Tincture; and the first 
Dispensatory of the College so orders it. The 
Colour of this is so very nice, that without 
|P_51
great care it may be spoiled many ways, but 
chiefly by putting it into metaline Vessels, or 
using too great a Fire, or continuing it too 
long upon it. 

[}Syrupus è Succo Violarum. }]
[}Syrup of the Juice of Violets. }]
This is made with the expressed Juice, and dou- 
ble the quantity, at least, of Sugar melted in a 
gentle Bath Heat, as directed in the preceding. 

It is seldom or never made this way; and it 
will not afford so elegant a Colour as the other, 
tho' it seems to promise more of the Virtues of 
the Flowers. 

[}Julepum Violarum. }]
[}The Violet Julep. }]
Take of Violet Flower Water four Pints, and 
one Pound of Sugar, which make into a Julep, 
S. A.

This is a Contrivance of Mesue, and hath 
been continued in all the College Dispensatories, 
but not, that I ever knew of, ordered in extem- 
poraneous Practice. 

[}Syrupus Chalybeatus. }]
[}Syrup of Steel. }]
Take of the Salt of Steel two Drams; dissolve 
it in one Ounce of compound Gentian Water, and 
add to it nine Ounces of the alterant Syrup of Ap- 
ples. Or otherwise, 

|P_52
Take equal Quantities of Steel Wine, and Sugar, 
and boil them into the Consistence of a Syrup. 

This latter way is commonly practised, but it 
is very apt to candy, because the more spiritu- 
ous any Menstruum is, it is the less suited to dis- 
solve and suspend Sugar: The Salts of the Steel 
likewise may very propably favour that Attracti- 
on that draws the Sugar in Conjuction there- 
with into Crystals. This Syrup was never be- 
fore ordered by the College, but is set down by 
Shipton, in his Appendix to their last Dispen- 
satory. 

[}Syrupus Balsamicus. }]
[}The Balsamick Syrup. }]
Take of Tolu Balsam two Ounces, and twelve 
Ounces of Spring Water, or any of the pectoral 
Waters: Boil them together in a circulatory Ves- 
sel, well luted, in a Sand Heat for two or three 
Hours. When the strained Liquor is cold, dis- 
solve in it twenty Ounces of fine Sugar, so as to 
make it into a Syrup, without any Heat. 

This hath not been received by the 
College, but is also added by Shipton to their 
last Dispensatory amongst his Additamenta. The 
manner of boiling is very justly contrived to pre- 
vent any Loss of the finer Parts by Exhalation, 
which it would do in an open Heat. After the 
same way may Syrups be made of Benjamin, Sto- 
rax, or other like Balsams. 

|P_53
[}Syrupus de Peto. }]
[}Syrup of Tobacco. }]
Take of the Juice of English Tobacco three 
Pints; of Simple Oxymel four Ounces; of Mead 
one Pint: Digest them together for four Days; 
then to the clear strained Liquor put two Pounds 
of Sugar, and make into a Syrup, S. A.

This hath been ordered by some old Dispen- 
satory Writers, and practical Authors, but was 
never before received by the College into any 
Editors of their Dispensatory. It is designed 
for an Emetic. 

[}Syrupus Croci. }]
[}Syrup of Saffron. }]
Take of the English Saffron one Ounce; infuse 
it in one Pint of Canary; and digest them together 
in a close Vessel by gentle Heat for three Days: 
Then press out the Wine, and dissolve in it twen- 
ty Ounces of the finest Loaf Sugar, so as to make 
it into a Syrup. 

This hath not before been ordered in any Col- 
lege Dispensatory, although much directed in ex- 
temporaneous Practice: And it seems to be one of 
the best of the simple Syrups, because capable of 
containing enough of the Ingredient in one Dose 
to answer some Junction of Consequence, which 
can be said but of few others. 

There are what the College have thought fit 
to put under the Title of Alterant Syrups; and 
out of this Class they have rejected abundance 
before ordered, as insignificant and in no respects 
worth the trouble of making. For indeed this 
|P_54
Form requires so much Sugar for the sake only 
of preserving the Composition, without any re- 
gard to its medicinal Intentions, that there is ve- 
ry little Virtue to be expected from the chief In- 
gredients. So that instead of most of the usual 
Alterant Syrups Decoctions may be drank in large 
Draughts, without any Inconvenience, the tenth 
Part of which not be conveniently taken 
at once when loaded with Sugar enough to pre- 
serve it in a Syrup.
