[}Strong Palsey-Water. }]
TAKE the Spirits of five gal- 
lons of the best Old Sherry- 
Sack, distill'd in a Limbeck: 
take Cowslip-flowers, the 
Flowers of Burrage and Bugloss, and 
of the Lillies of the Valley, of each 
one handful: Take also Rosemary- 
|P_124
flowers, Sage and Betony-flowers, of 
each one handful: Take each Flower 
in their Season, and so put into some 
of the Spirits aforesaid, in an open- 
mouth'd Glass of near a quart, for that 
will hold them all, with the Spirits, 'till 
you are ready to distil the Water; but 
this, and the rest of the Spirits, must 
be most carefully stopt 'till you use it: 
Take Lavender-flowers in their Season, 
strip them clean from their Stalks, and 
fill a wide-mouth'd gallon Glass with 
them; pour into them the remainder 
of your Spirits; then stop them close 
with Cork and Bladder, (as before) 
and let them stand six Weeks to digest 
in the Sun; then put all together, these 
and the first steep'd Flowers, with all 
the Spirits in both Glasses: Add also 
Balm, Motherwort, Spike-flowers, Bay- 
leaves and Orange-leaves, if to be had, 
of each an ounce, cut small, and put 
to the former Flowers and Spirits: 
Distil all these together in a Limbeck; 
make three Runnings of it; first a 
quart Glass, which will be exceeding 
strong; then a pint Glass, which will 
be almost as good; lastly, receive from 
it a pint Glass-full, or as much as runs 
|P_125
strong; for when it runs weak, which 
you may know by its Taste and Colour, 
which will be Whiter, let it run no 
longer: Put your three Runnings all 
together: Then take Citron-peel, the 
out-side Yellow Rind, or Lemon-peels 
thin pared, also Pine-seeds hull'd, of 
each six drams; of Cinnamon one ounce; 
of Nutmegs, Mace, Cardamoms, Cu- 
cubies, and Yellow Sanders, each 
half an ounce; of Lignum Aloes one 
dram; make all these into a gross 
Powder, putting among them also half 
a pound of Jujubes new and good, be- 
ing stoned, and cut small: Put all 
these Ingredients into a White Sarsnet- 
bag, to be hung in the Water afore- 
said: Take also of Prepared Pearls, 
two drams; of Prepared Smaragd a 
scruple, Amber, Greate, Musk, and 
Saffron, of each one scruple; of Red 
Roses, well dried, and sweet one ounce: 
These may be put in a little Bag by 
themselves, and hung in the Spirit, as 
the other: Close it well, that no Air 
gets in, for six Weeks; then take out 
the Water, and press the Bags dry; 
keep the Water in narrow-mouth'd 
Glasses close stopt. 

|P_126
[}The Use of the Water. }]
'Tis so strong and powerful, that it 
cannot be taken alone, but must be 
dropt on Crumbs of Bread and Sugar 
by any One, for Prevention: Take it 
first and last, and at our in the After- 
noon: Fast always before and after it 
a full Hour at least. 'Tis of exceeding 
virtue in all Swoonings, Weakness of 
Heart, and Decay'd Spirits, in all Pal- 
seys, Apoplexies, both to help in, and 
prevent a Fit; 'twill also keep all 
Cold Dispositions off the Liver, re- 
stores lost Appetite, and fortifies and 
strengthens the Stomach; 'twill alone 
cure a Dropsy, if taken at first, and 
the Patient be kept from Small and 
Cooling Liquors. 

[}A second Palsey-Water, made up- 
on the Ingredients of the first. }]
WHEN the first Water has run 
what is Strong, there will be 
some Small Water at the bottom of the 
Limbeck; pour it out from the Herbs 
and Flowers, and drain them; put them 
|P_127
into a gallon of the best Sherry, so let 
them stand close stopt five Weeks; then 
distil them, and let it run as long as it 
continues strong; then pour it into the 
Glass where the Sarsnet-bags are, and 
let them be in this second Liquor close 
stopt six Weeks; then you may use it, 
as the former, with Bread and Sugar: 
For tho' this is not so powerful as the 
former, 'tis too strong to take alone. 
Both these are good to bathe Outwardly 
the Part affected with Weakness by 
Palsey, and generally helps any violent 
Pains or Aches that any Part is vexed 
with; but because Bathing wastes 
most, and this Sort is less costly, they 
commonly use this second sort for that. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}A very good Snail-Water, for 
a Consumption. }]
TAKE half a peck of Shell-Snails, 
wipe them and bruise them Shells 
and all in a Mortar; put to them a 
gallon of New Milk; as also Balm, 
Mint, Carduus, unset Hyssop, and 
Burrage, of each one handful; Raisons 
|P_128
of the Sun stoned, Figs, and Dates, of 
each a quarter of a pound; two large 
Nutmegs: Slice all these, and put 
them to the Milk, and distil it with 
a quick Fire, in a cold Still; this will 
yield near four Wine-quarts of Water 
very good: You must put two ounces 
of White Sugar-candy into each Bottle, 
and let the Water drop on it; stir the 
Herbs sometimes, while it distils, and 
keep it cover'd on the Head with wet 
Cloths. Take five spoonfuls at a time, 
first and last, and at Four in the After- 
noon.

a Cordial. }]

ounce of Cinamon, one ounce of Saf- 
fron, two handfuls of Red Sage, as 
much Balm; steep these twenty-four 
Hours in two quarts of Sack, or as 
much good Brandy, which you please; 
distil it in a cold Still as quick as you 
can, and let it drop on four ounces of 
|P_129
Sugar-candy. Drink of this when 
Low-spirited. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}A Good Water for the Stone. }]
TAKE four quarts of White-Thorn- 
flowers, infuse them in two quarts 
of strong White-wine, with two ounces 
of Nutmeg sliced; let these stand two 
Days, then distil it in a cold Still. 
Drink it with Sugar, or without, as you 
like best.

quarts of White-wine, and a gallon of

wasted; then strain it, and add to it 
a quart of Honey; let that boil in the 
Liquor some time: When 'tis cold, 
Bottle it very close, and keep it for Use. 
'Twill keep many Years, and is neces- 
sary for all Families; two or three 
spoonfuls of it taken Morning and 
Night. 'Tis really good for Sores, 
Wounds, and Hurts New or Old, in 
Men, Women, and Children: Its Vir- 
tues of that kind are too long to men- 
tion: It has broke and brought away 
Inward Imposthumes.

[}An Excellent Balsom. }]
TAKE a quart of Spirit of Sack, 
infuse in it four ounces of Sarsapa- 
rilla cut short, two ounces of China

weed cut small; put all these in a two-

be tinctur'd as Yellow as Gold; then 
clear off the Spirit into another Bottle, 
|P_131
and put to it eight ounces of Gum- 
Guaice; set it in the Sun, as before, 
shaking it very often, 'till all the Gum 
be dissolv'd, except Dregs, which will 
be in ten or twelve Days; then clear 
it a second time from the Dregs, and 
put to it one ounce of Natural Balsom 
of Peru; shake it well together, and 
set it in the Sun for two Days; then 
put in one ounce of Balm of Gilead; 
shake all well together once more, and 
set it in the Sun for a Fortnight; 'tis 
then fit for Use, and will keep many 
Years. Its Virtues are too long to 
insert: 'Tis good to take Inwardly in 
most Distempers, and proper for all 
Sores or Wounds, by pouring in some 
Drops, and binding Lint thereon. 
The Dose, taken Inwardly, is from 
half a Spoonful to a whole one, in 
Sugar, or any Liquid Vehicle, for Con-

|P_134
Party afflicted spread a Plaister as big 
as the Swelling is, and apply: If it ga- 
ther to a Head, and break, after you 
have wash'd the Wound with warm 
Vinegar, apply some Lint rolled in an 
equal quantity of the Salve warm'd, 
and Honey; spread a Plaister of the

Ingredients, and put them to steep 
one Night in three pints of good clear 
New Ale; strain it, and drink no other 
Drink for six Weeks, Spring and Fall. 
You may do a larger quantity at a time 
for Man or Woman; but you must not 
infuse too much at a time, because the 
Herbs are apt to change it. At the

anoint with Juice of Rue, prepared as

sumption and Surfeits; Drank with 
|P_149
Wine in a Morning, 'tis good for a Pal- 
sey. A Bottle or two in a Vessel of 
decay'd Wine, revives it: It's good to

TAKE French-Flies, Methridate,

BEAT two handfuls of Rue, with 
as many Currants, 'till they are 
fine, and well mix'd; spread it on 
Cloths, and bind it to the Wrists, and 
Soles of the Feet: This draws from the 
Head; and, if laid on in time, does as 
much good as Pigeons to the Feet, 
in Extremity. 

|P_156
[}An Ointment that is good for 
any Ach, or Swelling, in Man

TAKE of unset Hyssop, Goats-

without Salt, and make it up in nine 
Balls, and let it lie nine Days; then 
boil it over the Fire gently: When it 
looks very Green, strain it off, and 
keep it for Use. 

This Number of Days, and Balls, 
seems superstitious and whimsical; but 
it has been so long approv'd in the 
Family from whence I had it, that I 
cannot doubt of its Virtues, tho' I smile 
at the Preparation.

through a new Canvas-Strainer, and 
put it on the Fire again, with four 
ounces of Yellow Bees-wax sliced thin; 
let it boil half an Hour this time, and 
pour it into Pots. 'Twill keep many 
Years, if ty'd down with Bladders. 
When you use it, rub White Paper 'till 
'tis soft, then spread it over with the 
Ointment, and anoint the Burn with 
the Ointment: Do it with a Feather, 
and lay the Paper over it: Do this 
Morning and Night, 'till 'tis quite Well. 
'Twill Skin the Wound, as well as take 
out the Fire; therefore be sure to use 
nothing else: 'Twill give Ease in a 
quarter of an Hour. 'Tis a certain 
|P_158
as well as a quick Cure, if the Vitals 
are not burn'd; and is recommended, 
on the Experience of a Person of great 
Worth and Charity. A third-part of 
this Quantity will last many Years, and 
may be made very Cheap.

[}An Ointment, which is a cer-

TAKE a quarter of an ounce of 
Red Precipitate, grind it on a 
Marble-stone, 'till 'tis as fine as the 
Flower of Brimstone; mix this with 
an ounce of Flower of Brimstone, and 
work both up with three ounces of 
Butter without Salt, as it comes from 
the Churn; mix it very well, and anoint 
the Place very thin with the Ointment. 
'Tis not the Nature of it to Check, but 
Draw Out the Distemper; and in a 
Week or Ten Days Confinement, will 
make an absolute Cure. 

I should say many things to recom- 
mend this, being sure of its Virtues;

but it will not need that, to Any-body

TAKE Red-Sage, and Rue, of 
each half a pound; young Bay- 
leaves, and Wormwood, of each a 
quarter of a pound: Stamp them 
unwash'd in a Mortar, with a pound 
and a half of Sheep's-suet hot from the 
Sheep, 'till 'tis all of a Colour: Then 
add to it a quart of Oyl-Olive, and work 
that with the rest: Then put it into an 
Earthen Pot well stopt for eight Days: 
Then boil it on on a soft Fire: Being 
ready to take off, pour in three ounces 
of Oyl of Spike; let it boil a little toge- 
ther; then strain it, and keep it for 
Use: Take care it do not burn. It 
|P_161
must be made in May, and will keep 
many Years: Rub'd into the small of 
the Back, it eases the Stone: The quan- 
tity of half a Pea in the Ear, chafed 
in and stopt with black Wool, helps 
Pains there; It Cures Stiffness or Strains, 
in Man or Beast; as also Bruises, 
Over-stretching of Veins, Fellons, An- 
guish, or Swelling of Wounds: It 
eases the Cramp; and is a good and 
useful Balsom in all Families.

marisk, Bees-wax two ounces, Gum 
Ammoniacum dissolv'd in Vinegar, half 
an ounce; Juice of Briany-roots, Smal- 
lage, and Golden-Rod, of each one 
ounce; let all boil, 'till the Juice of the 
Herbs be consumed: With this anoint 
the Belly of the Child, rubbing it in

an Hour every Night. 'Tis good if the 
Belly is Swell'd with Rickets, Worms, 
or Ague.

PICK Snails clean out of the Shells, 
and prick them full of Holes, hang 
them up in a Cloth, and put a Bason to 
catch what drops from them; which 
you must boil up with Speracity, and 
blades of Mace, of each one ounce: 
|P_163
Rub this Ointment along the Back-bone, 
round the Neck, Wrists, and Ancles. 
Use this constantly Night and Morn- 
ing, and chafe it in by the Fire; this, 
with the Drink that follows, has Re- 
cover'd many Weak Children from 
Sickness, Lameness, and Deformity. 

[}The Ricketty Drink. }]
PUT an ounce of Rhubarb, three 
hundred live Wood-lice, Sassafras, 
China, and Eringo-roots, of each three 
ounces; Roots of Osmond-royal, two 
onnces; Raisons of the Sun ston'd, 
two ounces; Hart's-Tongue, two hand- 
fuls: Put these into six quarts of Small 
Ale, and Drink Spring and Fall no 
other Drink. 'Tis almost infallible 
for weak Children. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}A cooling Drink in a Fever or 
Plurisie. }]
PUT an ounce of Pearl-Barley, into 
three Pints of Water; shift it twice; 
beat half an ounce of Almonds, with a 
|P_164
bit of Lemon-peel, and a spoonful or 
two of the Water; when they are very 
fine, wash the Almond-Milk through 
your Sieve, with three pints of Barley- 
Water; in the last boiling of this, you 
may put Mellon-seeds, and Pumpion- 
seeds, of each half an ounce; white 
Poppey-seeds, half a dram; when these 
are well boil'd, mix the Liquor with 
the Almonds, and strain all. Sweeten 
it with Syrop of Lemons, for a Fever, 
or Syrop of Maiden-hair, and Drink 
four ounces every three or four Hours. 

[}Another Drink in a Fever. }]
TAKE a little Sage, a little Balm, 
and a little Wood-sorrel, wash 
and dry them; slice a small Lemon, 
(after you have par'd it clean from 
the white and bitter part;) To these 
Herbs and sliced Lemon, pour three 
pints of boiling Water: Sweeten it to 
your Taste, and Drink as freely as 
you please. 

|P_165
[}Another Drink. }]

often shifted, put Harts-horn, 
and Ivory-shavings, of each three 
drams; Quick-grass-Roots, two ounces; 
Currants, one ounce; Red-rose-Water, 
half a pint; a very little Balm: Let it 
boil, and sweeten it with Syrop of Le- 
mons or Violets. If the Patient is 
Costive, a few drops of Spirit of Vitriol 
serves instead of Lemons, when that 
cannot be had: Of this you may Drink 
freely in a Fever or Quinsie. 

[}Another Sort. }]
CLEAR Posset-drink, pour'd on 
Wood-sorrel only, is good, and 
allays Thirst better than any other; 
and Pippins slic'd into Milk, is as good 
and better than all; if you have a Le- 
mon to slice in with them, being not 
sharp enough of themselves, to turn it 
to a pleasant clearness. 

|P_166
[}A cold Caudle in a Fever. }]
BOIL a quart of Spring-water; let 
it stand 'till cold, then add the 
Yolk of one Egg, the Juice of a small 
Lemon, six spoonfuls of Sack, and Su- 
gar to your Taste; Syrop of Lemons 
one ounce, if you have not fresh Le- 
mons, does as well; Brew all together 
'till well mixt, then Drink freely. 

Elder-flower-Water cold still'd, is an 
excellent Drink for Heat and Thirst; 
quicken each draught with five or six 
drops of Spirit of Vitriol; and sweeten 
it to your Taste. 

[}Wall-nut-Water, good In Agues

TAKE a pound of Rue, and a

the Fire; let them lie 'till they have 
done Hissing and Spitting; then wipe 
them from the Froth, and break them 
in a Mortar; have a quart of Earth- 
Worms, slit and scoured clean with 
Salt and Water; beat them with the 
Snails; then take Angelica, Salendine, 
Wood-sorrel, Agrimony, Bearfoot, Bar- 
berry-bark, Great Dock-roots, of each 
two handfuls; Rue half a handful, 
Rosemary-flowers, one quart; half 
a pound of Harts-horn, Termarick, and 
Fenigreek, of each two ounces; half 
an ounce of powder'd Saffron; and three 
ounces of Cloves fresh beat; shred these 
Ingredients, and Infuse all in three gal- 
lons of Strong Ale, for twelve Hours; 
then distil it, and draw off what runs 
good; and take three spoonfuls of 
this in a Glass of Sack or White-wine, 
an Hour before every Meal. Use 
moderate Exercise with it: 'Tis high- 
|P_168
ly recommended, and has been us'd 
with constant Success in Consumptions

very strong: Let the Person, if possi- 
ble, Drink all, that the Stomach may 
be perfectly clear; and go into a 
warm Bed, as soon as the Vomit has 
done working: Cover yourself close, 
and try to Sweat. It has seldom fail'd, 
and is a safe Vomit.

sterwort, and Butter-bur, of each one 
pound; Gentian, Tormentil, Scorzone- 
ra, and Virginia-Snake-weed, of each 
four ounces; Saffron one ounce: In- 
fuse all these, when shred, in two 
quarts of White-wine, one quart of 
Water, and one quart of French-Bran- 
dy distil'd, and use it in any Malignant 
Distemper. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}An admirable Posset-Drink, in 
a Plurisie, or Shortness of

INFUSE two ounces of Flax-seed, 
in a pint of clear Posset-drink; first 
bruise the Seeds. Drink this quanti- 
ty at a Draught every Morning, and 
at Night, if very Ill. 

 It has the same Virtues of Linseed- 
Oil; but is not so hard to take.

[}For an Inflammation in the

INFUSE one large handful of 
Cinqfoile in a quart of Water, 
let it boil to a pint; strain it, and 
sweeten it with Honey very sweet, and 
swallow two or three spoonfuls often. 
This, tho' a simple Medicine, has done 
great Cures, and may be rely'd on. 
The Herb is otherwise call'd Five- 
leav'd-Grass.

[}For a Cough, and Shortness 
of Breath. }]
TAKE eight ounces of Colts-foot 
pick'd clean from the Stalks; beat 
it to a perfect Conserve, with four ounces 
of Brown Sugar-candy, four ounces of 
Raisons stoned: When 'tis very fine, 
and well mix'd, add four ounces of 
Conserve of Roses; then add twenty 
drops of Spirit of Sulphur, and ten 
drops of Spirit of Vitriol: Mix it well, 
|P_171
and take as much as a large Nutmeg, 
as often as you please. I think the 
Juice of the Colts-foot, mixt with the 
Sugar-candy, is better than the Leaves, 
without straining. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}A good Way to make Caudle. }]
TO four full-quarts of Water you 
may put a pint of Whole Oat- 
meal; let it boil very slow for five or 
six Hours at least; then strain it out, 
and put to two quarts three large blades 
of Mace, a full pint and a half of White 
or Rhenish-wine; and make it sweet 
to your Taste: And just as you take 
it off the Fire, slice in a Lemon from 
which all the White is cut, which is 
apt, by lying long, to make it bitter; 
just the Yellow of the Peel may be 
put in. A little Salt does very well in 
Caudle, but is not often used. 

|P_172
[}A very good Purge in a Fever. }]
TAKE Sena two drams, Rhubarb 
one dram, Tamarinds two drams;

two-thirds be wasted; To what re- 
mains, add half an ounce of Cream of 
Tartar, sweetened with one ounce of 
Syrop of Succory, or Syrop of Roses 
solutive; strain and drink it at a 
Draught. In the Working, drink Cla- 
rify'd Whey, rather than Posset-Drink. 
'Tis good to Cool and Thin the Blood.

Thirsty Fever. }]
AN ounce an a half of Tamarinds,

candy finely beat one ounce; warm 
these together, with a little grated 
Nutmeg; pour to it near half a pint

in the Spring. It has recover'd many 
from Weakness, and Faint Sweats.

a Consumption. }]
TAKE Hore-hound, Harts-tongue, 
Liver-wort, Maiden-hair, Egri-

quantity at Night when you go to

B REW ten gallons of Strong Ale- 
Wort; when 'tis cool, work it with 
Yeast, and add as many fresh Red 
Poppies as the Wort will conveniently 
wet, so that you may stir it daily: Let 
the Poppies Infuse in this Wort three 
Days and Nights; then draw it off 
in a Limbeck as quick as you can, 
'till the whole is distill'd off: Mix 
the Small and Strong together, and 
take a glass at any time, with or with- 
out Sugar, after a full or disgusting 
Meal. 'Tis not much stronger than 
a Simple Water, but has been the only 
Cordial of an Infirm Lady, who has 
us'd it ever since Fifteen, and she is now 
Ninety-seven. This of my own know- 
ledge. 

|P_175
[}Another for a Surfeit. }]

repeat it 'till it does stay, and Sleep 
on it.

MAKE a Conserve of Buck-bean, 
with the weight in Sugar-candy; 
beat both fine, and take as much as a 
large Nutmeg, first and last; and drink 
a Tea made of the same Herb every 
Morning and Afternoon, constantly, 
for one whole Year. 

This alone, without any other Medi- 
cine, made a perfect Cure in a Person 
that had been many Years most 
|P_177
grievously afflicted; and is effectual in 
the Scurvy, or Rheumatic Pains. Where 
the Patient is Weak, and very Restless, 
'tis best to mix a third-part Venice- 
Treacle in the Conserve they take 
when going to Rest.

Spic'd Diatragacanth one scruple, Pow- 
der of Licorice half a dram; mix it in 
a good quantity of Syrop of Marsh- 
mallows. Take the quantity of a 
Wall-nut in a Morning fasting: Drink 
a Draught of plain Ale-Posset-drink 
immediately after it; then Walk an 
Hour: And after that, drink a pint 
(if your Stomach will bear it) of 
|P_179
White-wine Posset sweeten'd with Sy- 
rop of Marsh-mallows. 

N. B. This was the Prescription of 
a Learned Physician; and has been 
long kept as a choice Secret in a very 
Charitable Family, who have made 
numberless Experiments of it with mi- 
raculous Success, even to Dissolve the 
Stone. 

[}Another for Stoppage of Water, 
in the Stone. }]
TAKE four spoonfuls of the Juice 
of Parsley in a pint of White-wine; 
sweeten it with Syrop of Marsh-mal- 
lows, and (if you can) drink the 
whole quantity at a Draught. 

[}For the Stone. }]
MAKE a very strong Decoction of 
Mallows, thus; Put in half a peck 
of Leaves into one gallon of Water; 
let it boil to near half the quantity: 
Then strain it, and add half as many 
Leaves, and boil it again: Then add 
Licorice, stoned Raisons, and Syrop 
|P_180
of Marsh-mallows, of each two ounces; 
and drink continually of this Drink: 
It has given Ease to many in Extre- 
mity. Observe to strain it clean, and 
let it settle from the Thick before you 
pour it off. 

[}For the Stone. }]
TAKE of good White-wine one 
pint; Fennel, and Parsley-water, 
of each one pint: Into this Mixture 
put one ounce of Live Wood-lice well 
cleansed, one Lemon sliced thin, and two 
ounces of Syrop of Marsh-mallows; 
put these into a Jug to Infuse for five 
or six Days: Then strain it out, and 
let the Patient take four ounces at a 
time, twice a Day. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}For the Scurvy. }]
TAKE Scurvy-grass, Garden-Tansy, 
Wood-sorrel, and Golden-rod, of 
each one handful; beat these Herbs 
to a Conserve with their weight in 
Sugar; add to them an ounce of Pow- 
|P_181
der of Wake-Robin: Take as much 
Syrop of Oranges as will make this 
into an Electuary, of which take a 
dram three times a Day, for six 
Weeks together, in the Spring; drink- 
ing after it the following Drink. 

TAKE Garden-Tansy, Garden Scur- 
vy-grass, of each six handfuls; 
Buck-bean, Water-cresses, Brook-lime, 
and Wood-sorrel, of each four hand- 
fuls, the Peel of six Oranges, and one 
ounce of Nutmegs bruised; Infuse 
these in two gallons of New Strong 
Ale-wort; let it work together a Day 
and a Night; then distil it off in a 
Cold Still as long as it runs Good: 
Mix the Small, and drink a Wine- 
Glass-full after every Dose of the 
Electuary. 

This has been taken with great Suc- 
cess, by People who have been much 
afflicted with Scurvy Pains, and Spots. 
It has, by constant Taking, Cur'd a 
Rhumatism. 

|P_182
[}For the same. }]
ONE handful of Garden-Tansy, as 
much Sage, and twice as much 
Scurvy-grass, steep'd in two quarts of 
White-wine, or Strong Ale. Drink 
half a pint of this Morning and Night. 

[}For the same. }]
INTO five gallons of well Brew'd 
Small Ale, put in a Bag one large 
handful of Fir-tree-Tops cut small, 
two handfuls of Scurvy-grass, as much 
Water-cresses, one Pound of Burdock- 
root scraped and sliced, the Juice and 
Rinds of twelve Sevil-Oranges; let 
these be put in while the Ale is Work- 
ing: When it has done, stop it down 
'till 'tis Fine; then drink of it for a 
Month, or Six Weeks. 

Use the same for a Dropsy; adding 
only a quarter of a pound of Mustard- 
seed, and half a pound of Horse- 
radish-root. 

|P_183
[}An Excellent Purging-Ale for 
a Dropsy. }]
SENA four ounces; Sassafras, and 
Tartar, of each two ounces; Jalop, 
and Licorice, of each one ounce; Rhu- 
barb, Coriander, and Annis-seed, of 
each one ounce; Polypodiam eight 
ounces; Broom-ashes one quart, and 
one ounce of Cloves; put all in a Bag, 
with some little Weight to sink it: 
Take Scabious, and Agrimony, of each 
three handfuls; of the Roots of Danes- 
wort, one handful, Raisons of the Sun 
stoned one pound, with a little Ginger: 
Put these Ingredients into sweet Ale- 
wort, when you put in your Hops, and 
let all boil together half an Hour; 
then pour it scalding-hot on your Bag 
of Drugs: When 'tis cold enough, set 
it to Work with Yeast: When it has 
done Working, stop it up for Twelve 
Days, or a Fortnight: Hang the Bag 
of Drugs in the Vessel. Drink a large 
Glass of this in the Morning, and at 
Four in the Afternoon, unless you find 
it Works too much at first; if so, lessen 
|P_184
your Dose; but take it Daily, 'till you 
have taken all. 

[}For a Dropsy. }]
TAKE Broom, and burn it by it- 
self, in a clean Oven; sift the 
Ashes from the Stalks and Coals that 
are not quite consumed, and put two 
full pounds of these Ashes into a two- 
quart Bottle; pour on old Hock, 'till 
the Bottle is up to the Neck; take care 
'tis not too full; if it has not room to 
ferment, 'twill be apt to split the Bot- 
tle: digest it in hot Ashes by the Fire, 
or in the Sun, and shake it often: 
when it has stood three or four Days, 
pour off a quart of the clear Lye: if it 
is not perfectly fine, decant again and 
again, 'till it is so: fill up your Bottle a- 
gain with Hock, and do as before, 'till 
all the strength of the Ashes be out. 
Drink this first, and at four or five 
in the Afternoon; continue it for 
some time, and 'twill carry off the 
Dropsical Humour: While you take it, 
let the Meat you Eat be dry roasted; 
and your Drink, strong Ale or Wine. 

|P_185
[}For the Dropsy. }]
MIX four ounces of Syrop of Elder- 
berries, with two ounces of Oil of 
Turpentine, incorporate them well to- 
gether; and take one large spoonful of 
this mixture, first and last, for a Fort- 
night. 

Note, That Sea-bisket, and New 
Raisons of the Sun (if they can be 
had) eaten constantly, instead of Sup- 
pers, have Cured that Distemper with- 
out Physick: Especially if the Party 
can refrain from small Liquors. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}For the Jaundice. }]
CUT off the top of a Sevil-Orange, 
and take out as well as you can 
the middle Core and Seeds, without 
the Juice; fill the vacancy with Saf- 
fron, and lay the top on again; then 
roast it carefully without burning, and 
throw it into a pint of White-wine: 
Drink a quarter of a pint Fasting, for 
|P_186
nine Days; it greatly sweetens and 
clears the Blood.

Wild Germander, Wood-sorrel, 
Fumitory, of each half a handful; Wild 
Mercury one handful; Damask-Roses 
two handfuls; put these into two

'till 'tis scalding hot, then strain it off; 
and Drink half a pint at a Draught, 
four or five times in a Day, for a 
Month or five Weeks in the Spring. 
This is highly recommended in the 
Gout.

fore Dinner and Supper: Add Filings 
of Steel (if 'tis proper) two ounces.

ROAST a large Lemon 'till 'tis 
soft, take care it do not break; cut 
it and squeeze it (while 'tis very hot) 
upon a dram of Termerick slic'd or 
grated, and half a dram of Saffron; 
pour upon these Ingredients a pint of 
good White-wine: Let all Infuse one 
Night; and in the Morning, Fasting, 
take a quarter of a pint of this Liquor; 
sweeten it to your Taste with Sugar- 
candy; or if your Stomach can bear 
it, the Sugar-candy may be omitted; 
repeat this for four Mornings, or longer 
if you have Occasion. 'Tis for the most 
part a certain cure. 

|P_188
[}For the Stone. }]
WASH, dry, and very finely Pow- 
der the inner Skin of Pigeons- 
Gizzards: Take as much as will lie on 
a Shilling of this Powder, in a glass of 
White-wine. This does very often 
give ease in wracking Pain. 

[}Another for the Stone. }]
DRY and Powder the Haw-thorn- 
Berries, and take as much as 
will lie on a Shilling in a glass of White- 
wine: This has done great Cures, by 
constant taking; it may be taken in 
Ale, if you cannot have Wine; the 
Virtue is in the Berry, and has been 
experienc'd to the great ease of many 
poor People, in Ale as well as Wine; 
but the last is best: and a Posset- 
Drink turn'd with White-wine, is a 
proper Vehicle for it. Take it Fasting, 
or when in Pain. 

|P_189

or Rhumatism. }]

Sarsaparilla, and China, of each 
four ounces; Liquorish and Aniseeds, 
of each two ounces; Sage of Virtue, 
half a handful; Candy'd Eringo-root,

Strain and Drink it constantly, to 
sweeten the Blood.

in the peel of one Sevil-Orange, a hand- 
ful of Scurvy-grass, and as much Pow- 
|P_190
der'd Myrrh as will lie on a Shilling; 
stir all together, and let it boil up; then 
strain it, and hold a Mouthful as long 
as you can, once or twice a Day: It 
fastens loose Teeth, and makes the 
Gums grow up to the Teeth.

TAKE Plantain, and Red-rose- 
Water, of each half a pint; the

[}A Gargle in the Palsey. }]
PUT a large spoonful of Mustard- 
seed, bruis'd, into a pint of White- 
wine; drop in Spirit of Vitriol, to 
make it sharp; and wash your Mouth

root of your Tongue, as you can endure 
it at a time. 

[}Another Gargle in the Palsey. }]
POUR a quart of boiling Water 
upon a very large handful of La- 
vender-flowers; let it Infuse in the 
Ashes, 'till 'tis very strong; strain it, 
and add a spoonful of Vinegar, a spoon- 
ful of Hungary-Water, and a spoonful 
of Honey. Wash your Mouth often 
with this; it is a very good Gargle. 

|P_192
[}A constant Daily Wash for your 
Teeth. }]
TO one quart of Claret, put an 
ounce of Bole-armoniac, half an 
ounce of Myrrh, one dram of Allum; 
Salt of Vitriol, ten grains; an ounce

pour a spoonful of it into a Tea-cup of 
Water, with which wash your Teeth: 
It preserves them Sound, and makes 
them White.
