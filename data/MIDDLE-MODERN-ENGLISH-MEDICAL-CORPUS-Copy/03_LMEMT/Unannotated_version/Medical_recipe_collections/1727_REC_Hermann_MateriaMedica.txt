[}Of ROOTS. }]
[}§. 1. Of Acorus, commonly called Cala- 
mus Aromaticus, or Sweet Smelling 
Flag. }]
ACORUS is twofold: The Aco- 
rus of the Ancients, which is Cala- 
mus Aromaticus; and the Officinal 
Acorus, which is divided into the 
Small and Thick. 

It is of an acrid and hot Taste, and has an 
agreeable Smell. 

|P_2
It contains, as appears by Sublimation, a 
Volatile Salt, an Exalted, or Essential Oil, and 
some few Fixt Salts. 

From whence it enjoys the following Vir- 
tues: It is Cephalick, inasmuch as it evapo- 
rates the Humidities of the Brain, and there- 
by corroborates the Solids; so that the relax'd 
Tone is chang'd into a just Tenseness, and Dis- 
orders of this Part, depending on a phlegma- 
tick or moist State, are greatly abated, and 
by Continuance may be cur'd. 

N. B.All Aromaticks, or all Plants, which 
have tetrapetalous Flowers and Husks contain- 
ing very small Seeds, and such is Acorus, are 
Cephalick. 

It is Diuretick and Diaphoretick; the 
first, Because by its oleous and fixt Particles 
it unites with the Blood; for Oils unite not 
with Water or Serum, without Salts: Now 
volatile Parts endeavouring to separate; if this 
Separation is feebly done, they prove Diure- 
tick; but if 'tis done with Vigor, they prove 
Diaphoretick; for these Discharges only differ 
in Degree. 

It is Alcalious; because it absorbs any Acid 
whatever, whether in the Scurvy, or slow Fe- 
vers; and by its fixt Salt it is not so easily 
evaporated out of the Blood [/1./]. 

|P_3
It is Carminative; inasmuch as the saline 
Parts prick the Bubbles giving Colick Pains, 
and let out the Wind they contain. 

It is Stomachick, and therefore is it also 
Uterine, since whatever relieves, or prejudices 
the Stomach, is observ'd to produce the same 
Consequences upon the Womb; and as the Sto- 
mach is assisted by this Root in Case of acid, 
aqueous, or viscid Contents; the Womb labour- 
ing under Disorders from Coagulations, from 
watry or phlegmatick Fluxes, or from a re- 
lax'd State of Fibres, must be benefited from 
the same Particles; tho' more slowly, since 
Time must be allow'd the Medicine to arrive 
at the Womb, by reason of its Distance from 
the Stomach; and since the Medicine's whole 
Force is exerted upon the Contents and Fibres 
of the Stomach, but when blended with the 
Blood, it is in great Measure blunted, and di- 
vided into many Parts, some of which only 
reach the Womb. And as a certain Degree 
of Consistence, Acrimony, and Fulness do con- 
tribute to promote the Menstrua, wherever their 
Disappearance arises from a Viscosity of the 
Juices, this Root is given with Success. 

It is good in Dropsical Constitutions, as it 
agitates and incides the Fluids, and twinges 
the excretory Ducts of the Glands of the Skin 
and Kidneys, and renders their Secretions more 
plentiful. 

It is Cephalick, because it is fragrant: This 
Scent depending upon volatile oily Salts; they 
penetrate deep, and into the most distant Re- 
cesses of the Fibres, and there dissolve stag- 
nating Humors, which raise Pains, and a 
Train of Chronical Distempers in the Head: 
|P_4
This Root is cordial to the Body, because it 
supplies Spirits. 

N. B.Plants, which bear Catkins, have 
always volatile Parts in them, which are un- 
der a State of Avolation, and which, there- 
fore, are fit soon to extricate their Virtues, and 
imbibe immediately Humidities any where. 

Its Dose must not exceed a Dram: It is 
best us'd in Infusion, or Tincture, with Spirit 
of Wine; for in Powder, Electuary, Trochises, 
or Decoction, its volatile Parts, in which are 
lodg'd its chief Virtues, fly off. Its Chymical 
Oil is sometimes given to three or four Drops 
in Colicks; for Example, Take Oil of Calamus 
aromaticus 3 Drops, Sugar Candy half a Dram, 
mix, and make a Powder. It is sometimes also 
us'd in Candy for the same Purpose. 

[}§. 2. Alcanna, Anchusa, Alkanet, or 
Orkanet. }]
IT is of an astringent, or binding Taste: 
It consists of terrestrial, or earthy, and 
gross Particles. 

Wherever there is an Occasion for a re- 
stringent Quality, and where Serosities prevail, 
it is reputed a specifick Drug: Because by its 
earthy Particles it incrassates the Serum, and 
retards its Motion, and absorbs it; and there- 
fore it cools the Blood; for as that depends 
on Motion, the Slackening of Motion abates 
the Heat; and the Coldness wherewith we are 
|P_5
affected is proportional to the Slowness of this 
Motion. 

Hence is it us'd in all Fluxes of Blood or 
Humors, and it both incrassates them, and 
contracts the Fibres. 

As it exerts its Force, and communicates its 
restringent Virtue, either in Powder or Decoc- 
tion; therefore is it us'd in either. 

If the genital Parts exceed in their Di- 
mensions, and thereby become unfit to retain 
the Semen, from whence ensues Barrenness, the 
Decoction is to be so warily us'd, as not to 
suppress the Menstrua. 

ItsGenerical Mark is, that it has monope- 
talous Flowers. 

[}§. 3. Allium, Garlick. }]
IT consists of a sulphureous volatile Salt: It is 
call'd Theriaca Rusticorum, or the Clown's 
Treacle: Its Use is nearly abolish'd, because 
it smells so rank; and it occasions great Thirst. 
It is an excellent Remedy against Worms and 
Dropsy. Celsus gave it to Dysenterical Persons 
with Success. Roasted under the Embers it 
avails in Tingling Ears, if thrust into the Pas- 
sage of the Ear, and even cures a beginning 
Deafness, as I have often experienc'd. If 
taken upon an empty Stomach, it is an ex- 
cellent Stomachick, and attenuates all viscous 
Phlegm. I have often us'd it outwardly in 
Worms, but it always acted as a Blister; how- 
ever it is most efficacious in a Suppression of 
Urine apply'd to the Os pubis and Perinæum, 
if apply'd in the following Manner. 

|P_6
TAKE Three Heads of Garlick, Bay-Berries 
one Ounce, Juniper-Berries half an Ounce, 
beat them in a Mortar, add Barley-Flower 
one Handful, boil them all in Wine to the 
Consistence of a Poultis, and apply it warm. 

And in a Colick, if it be apply'd with Cha- 
momile, it proves successful. 

[}§. 4. Althæa, Marsh Mallows. }]
IT is of a slimy, viscid, smooth Taste. 

Wherefore it consists of watry, oily, 
viscous Particles; and as it contains few volatile 
Parts, therefore it is not to be distill'd. 

It is Emollient, and Anodyne: It softens 
the Salts that harden Wounds, and prick them 
into Pains: It obtunds, and envelopes the acri- 
monious Salts, which occasion Consumptions, 
Ulcers of the Kidneys or Bladder: It glibs 
the Passages in a Fit of the Stone, and thus eases 
the Anguishes of these Diseases. 

Its Preparations are Ointment of Marsh- 
Mallows and a Syrup. 

If we have Reason to fear that its Mucilage 
will raise Colick Pains in the Bowels, and yet 
its Use is found necessary, we must blend it 
with some Aromaticks, as Cinnamon, or the 
like, that the Mucus may be attenuated. 

ItsGenerical Mark is, that it has semilunar 
Seeds, like half a Cheese; and all Plants, having 
such Seeds, are observ'd to be Emollient. 

|P_7
[}§. 5. Angelica. }]
IT is of an acrid, and gently-bitterish Taste, 
and of a fragrant, aromatick Smell. That 
Root which is most resinous is the best. 

It consists of volatile Salts and Oil: It is 
reckon'd a Specifick against Acidities, because 
by its Oil it envelopes them, and by its Salts 
it causes a Tenuity of the Fluids, from whence 
it promotes the Circulation. Hence it avails 
in all Contagions, in Diseases of the Womb ari- 
sing from Acidities of the Blood, as also in 
Distempers of the Head and Nerves springing 
from the same Origin: First, because it vola- 
tilises the Acid in the vertebral and caro- 
tid Arteries, which water the Head, and 
drives them forth by Sweat or Urine: Then, 
because of its oleose Particles, it defends the 
Nerves from being lacerated, twitch'd, or 
prick'd by Acids. 

[/2./]N. B.It belongs to the umbelliferous 
Kind of Plants, and therefore like them, it 
opens, attenuates, incides, is Diuretick and 
Carminative. 

Beware how you give this Root to Per- 
sons that are emaciated, hectical, consumptive, 
lean, or afflicted with Colicks taking their Rise 
from harden'd Excrements; for its moveable 
|P_8
and volatile Parts warm, and overheat the 
Blood, and increase the Symptoms. 

It is us'd in Substance or Infusion, but not 
in Decoction; since its volatile Parts fly away. 
Its Dose is from a Scruple to a Dram in 
Powder; in Infusion two Drams at most at a 
Time in four Ounces of Liquor. Its Extract 
is prepar'd with Spirit of Wine, and add Oil 
of Angelica what will suffice, to make an Es- 
senc'd Extract for Use in the aforesaid Cases. 

[}§. 6. Apium, Parsley. }]
IT is of a subacrid and grateful Taste, and 
of a Smell gently fragrant. 

N. B. The greatest Virtue is in its Tops. 

It consists of sharp fixt saline Particles; 
but has few volatile oily Ones, as appears by 
Distillation, or Chymical Analysis. 

It is Diuretick, because it sets the Blood 
into Motion by its volatile Parts; and by its 
plentiful fixt Salts, it twinges the secretory 
Ducts of the Kidneys, and serves as a [/3./] lasting 
Stimulus there, to invite a copious Secretion; 
which are two Things requir'd in promoting 
Urine. 

|P_9
Where there is Danger of fusing the Fluids 
too much, and raising Commotions thereby, we 
must avoid its Use; and therefore in the Epi- 
lepsies of Children it must be forborn. 

We use it in Decoction, because it readily 
gives out its Salts; but Infusion does not so 
well extract them; which shews us, that its 
Salts are not easily extricated; we use it not 
in Powder, because it would be too bulky, its 
active Parts being too few with Regard to its 
passive. 

N. B. Diureticks in a large Quantity prove 
Diaphoretick; because then they agitate the 
Blood too furiously, and rather towards the 
Circumference than the Kidneys, and therefore 
the Serum is driven out by Sweat. 

ItsGenerical Mark is, that it is a Plant 
having pentapetalous Flowers and two Seeds 
join'd together; and is umbelliferous, and there- 
fore agrees with such in their inciding, atte- 
nuating, opening, carminative, and diuretick 
Qualities. 

[}§. 7. Arum, Wake Robin. }]
IT is of a most hot, warm, biting, acrimo- 
nious Taste, but has no Smell. 

Wherefore it consists of very pungent, 
rigid, and nearly caustick [/4./] volatile Salts; and 
|P_10
therefore it attenuates by insinuating its vola- 
tile Parts into the Blood, by lifting up and 
[/5./] moving the Mass of Juices; it corrects Vis- 
cidities, separates them into minute Parts, and 
thins and incides gross and viscid Particles, 
which adhere to the Stomach and Lungs; for 
when Particles are attenuated, the fixt, pun- 
gent, and acute Salts, by their hexagonal, or 
angular Figures, incide, and Solution accom- 
panies Incision. 

It moves Urine powerfully in a State of 
Blood, where the Mass is too strictly united. 

Its Powder is accounted vulnerary, where 
there is a putrid Mucilage resting in the 
Wound; otherwise it is too sharp. 

ItsGenerical Mark is, that it is a Baccife- 
rous Plant. 

|P_11
[}§. 8. Aristolochia longa, Long Birth- 
wort. }]
IT is of a subacrid, bitterish Taste, but 
has little Smell, only it is somewhat in- 
offensive. 

Wherefore it consists of fixt Salts mostly, 
and some few volatile Ones. 

It enjoys nearly the same Virtues as Roots 
consisting of volatile Salts, for it volatilises, or 
however dissolves grumous and congeal'd Blood, 
occasion'd from acid Salts in the Mass; and as 
it imbibes into its Pores these tart and sour 
Humors, it therefore is us'd by Surgeons in 
Powder upon carious Bones to suck up those 
Acidities lodg'd in that Sanies. 

It is Thoracick, and a Preservative against 
Consumptions; because after the manner of vo- 
latile Salts, it incides, and corrects such acri- 
monious Acids, as are apt to degenerate into 
Ulcers [/6./]. 

|P_12
It is reckon'd an Uterine, both upon Ac- 
count of its fixt and few volatile Salts; where- 
fore is it us'd as an Alterative to reduce the 
Mass of Blood to a proper State, and to re- 
open the obstructed Menstrual Flux, and even 
to expel the dead Infant from the Womb, 
where lodging longer than it ought, it pro- 
duces Fevers of a dangerous Kind. 

It is given in Substance to a Dram at most; 
and in Decoction to two Ounces at a Time. 

ItsGenerical Mark is, that it is hexacap- 
sular. 

[}§. 9. Aristolochia rotunda, Round Birth- 
wort, }]
IS more bitter, acrid, and more stinking 
than the Long Birthwort. 

Wherefore it consists of a greater Quan- 
tity of fixt Salts, as also of more volatile Salts 
and Oils; to prove which, the Root keeps not 
long without losing its Virtue. 

It is reputed good in Heart-burnings, and 
in eroding Humors lodging in the Bowels, 
and introducing Colical Pains; because it spe- 
cifically corrects Acidities by its porous Sub- 
stance, and its fixt and volatile Salts. 

[}§. 10. Aristolochia Clematis, Saracen 
Birthwort. }]
THIS Root is yet more bitter, more 
acrid, and more smelling, than either of 
the foregoing. Wherefore are its Salts, both 
|P_13
fixt and volatile, more copious and stronger, 
than theirs. 

Its Root then is more efficacious than the 
former; but if it be not fresh, its Virtues are 
much abated. 

It is reckon'd a Specifick against the Scab, 
inasmuch as it corrects those sharp and aculeated 
Salts, which introduce it. 

[}§. 11. Aristolochia Fabacea, or Bean- 
Birthwort. }]
It is bitterish, but of no Smell: It consists 
of fixt Salts, whence it incides, and has 
the Virtues of Long Birthwort. Its Powder 
sprinkled on Wounds absorbs the Humidities 
in Ulcers, and is us'd with Success in carious 
Bones. It is us'd in Powder, Decoction, and 
Infusion. 

[}§. 12. Asarum, Asarabecca, }]
IS of an acrid, pungent, [/7./] nauseous Taste, 
and somewhat styptick, and of an ungrate- 
ful Spikenard Smell. 

|P_14
It consists of fixt and volatile Salts, and 
some viscous Parts. 

It is Cathartick and Emetick, because the 
offensive Particles vellicate the upper and lower 
Parts of the Stomach too forcibly. 

It is reckon'd [/8./] uterine, sudorifick, diure- 
tick, and an Opener of the Obstructions of the 
Menstrua, and a Dissolver of all Coagulations; 
it is us'd in Quartans as a Specifick, and is 
good in a scorbutick Jaundice. 

Its Preparations are, 1. Diasarum Fernelii, 
whose Dose is from half a Scruple to a Scruple. 
2. Coagulum Asari, made with Spirits of Wine. 
3. Its Extract, which is its best Preparation, 
and is us'd successfully in Quartans, Tertians, 
and scorbutick Jaundices. 

Its Dose is from a Scruple to two Drams. 

ItsGenerical Mark is to be tricapsular. 

It is corrected with Acids, as Salt-petre, 
and with oily Drugs, such as Nutmeg, or 
Mace; for Oils obtund its Salts: But Salts, 
whether fixt or volatile, encrease its stimula- 
ting Faculty. 

Nine Leaves of Asarabecca, bruis'd and in- 
fus'd in white Wine, three Ounces, express the 
Juice. Let it be given in a Morning in a 
Jaundice. 

|P_15
TAKE Leaves of Asarabecca (fresh) three 
Drams, bruise them, and express the Juice, 
two Ounces and an half of Decoction of 
Rhadishes, express, and mix with Syrup of 
Agarick one Ounce; make a Draught which 
will vomit extremely; and this Diemer- 
broeck us'd much. 

[}§. 13. Asparagus, Sparrow-Grass. }]
IT is of a gently subacrid and gratefully sweet 
Taste, but has no Smell. 

It consists of a gentle [/9./] fixt Salt, which by 
an easy and further Digestion in the Blood 
becomes volatile; and hence it is Diuretick, 
because by this fixt Salt it fuses the Blood, 
and irritates the Kidney-Glands, and Ducts, 
and encreases the Secretion; and gives the Wa- 
ter a stinking Smell and a muddy Consistence, 
somewhat analogous to [/10./] Turpentines, giving 
a Flavor. 

It is us'd in making Syrup of the five 
opening Roots, and in Decoctions, but not in 
Infusion; because its Salt is not extracted 
by it. 

|P_16
It is Emmanagogue, because if they are ob- 
structed from viscous Particles in the Mass of 
Blood, as appears by a white Sediment sticking 
to the Chamber-pot, they attenuate, and re- 
open the Passages. 

Its Generical Mark is, that it is bacciferous. 

[}§. 14. Bardana, Burdock. }]
IT is of a gently bitterish, sweetish, subacrid 
Taste; but of no Smell. 

It, therefore, consists of gentle fixt Salts, 
and some few volatile also, as also of some 
oleous Particles. 

Its Virtues are to be Diaphoretick and Diu- 
retick from the Salts it contains; and it is ano- 
dyne in the [/11./] Venereal Disease, because it con- 
tains Oils: For this Reason it is, we give it 
in the Leprosy; First, because by its Salts it 
volatilises the acid Salts in that Disease, and 
then by its oily Parts it relieves the Itching 
so common in the same: It is upon these Ac- 
counts also us'd in Gouts as a Specifick, by ea- 
sing their Pain, and attenuating their Juices. 
For its oily Parts, it is look'd upon as Nu- 
tritive also. 

ItsGenerical Mark is, that it is a [/12./]Capi- 
tated Plant; and all such are Diaphoretick and 
Diuretick. 

|P_17
[}§. 15. Beta, Beets. }]
THIS Root is call'd The Smith's Dinner: 
It is us'd in Decoctions and Glysters to 
loosen the Belly; for it abounds with watry 
and nitrous Particles; upon which Account it 
softens the Excrements, and irritates the In- 
testines to throw out their Contents, and there- 
fore answers all Ends. 

The Juice of Beets brings a Mucus out of 
the Nostrils; and therefore some use it as a 
Sternutatory in Apoplexies. 

According to Hoffman, Beets are hot, 
because it contains a great Deal of Nitre [/13./]; 
and therefore it deterges. 

Its Root is shap'd, and us'd as a Supposi- 
tory for provoking to Stool. 

They are us'd in Decoction to wash off 
the Filth and Scurff sticking to the Head, and 
they may be us'd to keep Issues open, as I 
often order them. 

[}§. 16. Bistorta, Bistort. Serpentaria, 
Snake-weed. }]
IS of an astringent Taste, (drawing the 
Tongue together.) 

It, therefore, consists of [/14./] terrestrial, or 
earthy Particles. 

|P_18
Its Virtues are to absorb Humidities, to 
incrassate the Humors, to retard the Motion 
of the Blood; and upon these Accounts it 
is reputed cooling also: From hence, where- 
soever Rest is requir'd, as in Fevers, Dysen- 
teries, and Hæmorhages, it is a convenient Re- 
medy. 

Its Powder appeases Vomiting. It is us'd 
with tormentil Root in Decoction to three 
Ounces for one Dose. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is a pentapetalous 
Plant. 

[}§. 17. Bryonia alba, White Bryony. }]
IS of an acrid, bitterish, nauseous, and vis- 
cous Taste, but has no Smell. 

N. B.Bryony is an English Mechoacan, 
and Mechoacan an American Bryony. 

It consists of volatile and fixt Salts, enve- 
loped in some nauseous Ones. 

|P_19
Wherefore it purges, altho' but slowly: 
It purges [/15./], because its Salts vellicate, and 
twinge the Stomach and Intestines, from whence 
also it sometimes vomits; but, as it is endued 
with viscous Parts, it is apt to raise Gripes, by 
adhering to the Coats of the Stomach; and it 
should be corrected with Aromaticks, which 
by their volatile Salts and essential Oils do in- 
cide the viscid. But also Oil of Vitriol, or any 
acid Spirit serves to bring its fixt and volatile 
Parts into Play [/16./]. 

Its Preparations are Fœcula Bryoniæ; this 
Powder is given with one or two Drops of 
Oil of Cloves. Its Tincture may be made with 
Spirit of Wine, and corrected in the same Man- 
ner, which is good in œdematous Tumors. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is a pentapetalous, 
bacciferous, climbing Plant. 

|P_20
[}§. 18. Bryonia nigra, Black Bryony, }]
IS of an acrid, bitterish, ungrateful, mucila- 
ginous, or slimy Taste. 

It consists of fixt, and volatile Salts, and of 
some oily and earthy Parts. 

It is us'd as a Discutient in œdematous Tu- 
mors, and as a Specifick in a Gout, if it be 
bruis'd and applied to the Part in Pain [/17./]; be- 
cause by its mucilaginous Particles it obtunds 
and softens, and by its volatile it throws off 
the stimulating Elements. 

[}§. 19. Carlina, The CarlineThistle. }]
IT is of an acrimonious Taste, and also aro- 
matick in Taste and Flavor. 

It consists of volatile Salts and essential Oils, 
as appears by its Smell. 

ItsGenerical Mark, being capitated, as well 
as its Particles volatile, prove it to be diapho- 
|P_21
retick, diuretick, and friendly to the Nerves, 
as also to be uterine [/18./]. 

Its Preparations are an Oil, which is us'd 
in Sugar in Hysterick Cases. It is us'd in De- 
coction[/19./], but while it is boiling the Vessel 
must be shut, lest its volatile Parts fly too 
much off: It must, however, be observ'd, that 
it shou'd not be given too strong, for then it 
will occasion Vomiting. It is us'd in Powder
also. 

[}§. 20. Caryophyllata, Avens, or Bennet. }]
IS of a subacrid, and gratefully-bitter Taste, 
but has no Smell, whilst it is fresh, and yet 
when dry'd, it is scented. 

|P_22
It is aromatick, therefore, and also has a 
Salt, so that it is stomachick, inciding, attenu- 
ant, and a Dissolver of grumous Blood, and is 
us'd as a Specifick in Pains of the Head, arising 
from a gross Blood. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It has a pentapetalous 
Flower. 

[}§. 21, Cava, or Hollow Fumitory.}]
IS of a bitterish Taste, and of little Smell. 

It, therefore, consists of fixt and some 
volatile Salts, as also of Oils. 

It is reputed a Specifick in an Asthma [/20./], 
arising from a mucilaginous State of Humors; 
because by its fixt and volatile Salts, it incides, 
and volatilises the Juices: Upon which Grounds 
it happens, that in Melancholy, and other Dis- 
eases proceeding from an Acidity in the Blood, 
it is much in Use; because its Salts are con- 
trary to the Salt that occasions the Distem- 
pers. It is stomachick, because it is aroma- 
tick; and is us'd where Long Birthwort is 
prescrib'd. 

|P_23
It expels the Menses and the dead Child, 
by its moving and active Salts and Corpuscles. 

It is us'd in Decoction, Infusion, and Pow- 
der, in which Form it is mostly us'd in ca- 
rious Bones, to imbibe those acid Salts that 
have contributed to corrupt them. 

[}§. 22. China orientalis, Oriental China. }]
IT is the Root of the rough Chinese Smylax. 

It is of a farinaceous, insipid Taste, in 
some Measure astringent [/21./]. 

It, therefore, contains unctuous, oily, and 
smooth Particles, gently saline. 

Its Virtues are to correct such Humors as 
are acrimonious, bilious, corrosively acid and 
obstructive; because by those smooth and oily 
Parts it entangles, lenifies, and softens the acu- 
leated Bodies: It has been reputed a Diapho- 
retick and how far it may contribute towards 
this Work, may be readily seen by taking a 
View of the Requisites for a Sweat. First, 
The Circulation in a Sweat shou'd be deter- 
minately rapid. Secondly, The Pores in a 
Sweat must be open'd. Thirdly, The Serum 
shou'd be easily separable from the Globules, 
or Cake of the Blood. Fourthly, Immoderate 
Heat of the Blood, as in the άκμϗ of Heat in 
a Paroxysm of an intermitting Fever, hinders 
Sweats: How far China contributes towards 
these Performances may be guess'd, for it re- 
|P_24
tards a rapid Motion, glues the Particles of 
the Blood together, and rather shuts than opens 
the Pores by its Astringency: So that in no 
Instance will it answer this Purpose, save in the 
latter, where in Decoction it may serve to 
abate the excessive Rapidity of the Juices; and 
as Sweats depend upon a certain Degree of 
Motion, if ever the Blood moves too fast for 
Sweats, it does it by bringing down this Ra- 
pidity: In which Case it must be noted, that 
whoever has a Mind to sweat must take their 
Liquors warm; they must use a thin Diet, 
and must compose themselves to it by the As- 
sistance of a warm Bed, or a Bagnio. 

It is us'd always in Decoction, where four 
Things must be observ'd: First, It must be 
cut into Slices. Secondly, The Pot in which 
it is boil'd must be close shut, in order to get 
out its Salts contain'd in it in a small Quan- 
tity. Thirdly, We must macerate it, and use 
a gentle Fire. Fourthly, It must be boil'd 
for ten Hours together. 

It is us'd in the Gout to correct the Salts 
of the Blood, in the following Manner. 

[}In the Gout. }]
TAKE Roots of China two Ounces, Salsapa- 
rilla one Ounce, Herb Ground-pine, Ger- 
mander, Rosemary, Sage (and for Women 
Savin) of each an Handful. Slice them, 
mix them, and boil them in Milk; Spices 
may be added, as also Syrup of Penny-Royal, 
Goat's Rue, or Mugwort. 

|P_25
[}In the Scurvy. }]
TAKE Roots of China one Ounce, Salsapa- 
rilla half an Ounce, Guaiacum Wood three 
Ounces; mix, and make a Decoction in 
Water and Wine as much as suffices; to 
which, boiling hot, add Winter's-Bark two 
Drams, Juniper Berries half an Ounce, 
Syrup of Scurvy-grass, one Ounce and an 
half to two Pounds of the Decoction. 

[}In a Consumption. }]
TAKE China one Ounce, Colts-foot two Oun- 
ces, Bark of Sassafras, Currans, of each 
half an Ounce; mix, and make a Decoction 
in Water and Wine: For thus the acri- 
monious Particles, which cause a Consump- 
tion, are involv'd, and wrapt up with the 
oily Parts of the Root. 

It is reputed a Specifick in an Atrophy, 
because the oily Parts of the Root envelope 
the corrosive Acid, and its volatile, tho' few, 
gently open the Obstructions of the Capilla- 
ries, and attenuate the Viscid, and de-obstruct 
them, so as to admit Nourishment. 

|P_26
After the venereal Disease is cur'd by a 
[/22./] Salivation, the Custom is to prescribe thus, 

TAKE China Root, Salsaparilla, Bark of 
Guaiacum of each two Ounces, Wood of the 
same half an Ounce, Sassafras Wood one 
Ounce, boil them in Water twenty Pounds 
to ten Pounds. 

By this Prescription whatever of Acidity is 
remaining will be rooted out. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is an hexapetalous 
and bacciferous Plant, in which Berries are con- 
tain'd Stones. It is referr'd to the bacciferous 
and climbing Plants. 

[}§. 23. China occidentalis, Occidental 
China. }]
ITS Taste is the same with the former, as 
is its Generical Mark; but it is weaker, 
and less in Use. 

|P_27
[}§. 24. Consolida major, Comfrey. }]
IT is of a sweetish, mucilaginous, and vis- 
cous Taste. 

It consists of mucous, thick, watry, and oily 
Particles; from whence it has the following 
Virtues. 

Its sweetish Taste bespeaks it of a temperate 
and middle Nature, because some saline, and 
sulphureous Corpuscles are always well blended 
and incorporated in a sweet Taste; and its mu- 
cous and viscous Taste shew it to have a Power 
of consolidating and gluing [/23./] Wounds together. 

It mollifies, and is anodyne, because its 
smooth and oily Parts cover over, and, by its 
watery, it dissolves, the saline Particles, which 
hinder a Cure of Ulcers, or Wounds; there- 
fore is it us'd as an internal Vulnerary. 

It is a Specifick in Exulcerations, or Ex- 
coriations of the Kidneys, especially such as are 
rais'd from Cantharides; and then it is boil'd 
in Milk and drank. 

It is us'd internally to breed a Callus in 
Bones that are fractur'd [/24./]. 

|P_28
Wherever Acrimony is the Cause of a 
Disease, it is a Specifick; because the viscous Par- 
ticles wrap up the Salts: From whence it is 
of Use in Dysenteries, and in Ulcers of the 
Lungs, or in Coughs proceeding from sharp, 
tickling Salts, which are betray'd by a tickling, 
dry Cough. 

Its Juice express'd glues together, and heals 
external Wounds. 

In short, 'tis emollient, anodyne, aggluti- 
nant, consolidating, good in Ulcers and all sharp 
Humors. 

N. B. It is always us'd internally in De- 
coction, and lest its Particles, being viscous, 
should stick to the Wrinkles of the Guts, 'tis 
advisable to add to the Decoction the Seeds 
of Fennel, or some such Aromatick; and This 
is a General Rule for all viscous Plants. 

Its Preparations are only Syrup of Com- 
frey of Fernelius, whose Dose may be to two 
Ounces. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It has monopetalous, 
tuberose, cylindrical Flowers, dispos'd into Jags, 
with four Seeds join'd together. 

[}§.25. Contrajerva, Contrayerva. }]
IT is gently acrid, and of a sweet, grateful, 
aromatick Flavor, and somewhat astringent. 

It, therefore, consists of some few volatile 
Salts, and Oils, and of some earthy Ones. 

It is Diaphoretick, from its acrimonious, vo- 
latile Parts imparting Motion to the Blood. It 
|P_29
is alexipharmick, as the Name imports; for the 
Spaniards, who are Inhabitants of Peru, where 
this grows, call Poison Jerva; so that Contra- 
jerva signifies somewhat against Poison; and it 
is such, because it abounds with such Particles 
as hinder Stagnation, and Coagulations, com- 
monly produc'd by a certain Sett of Poisons. 

It is also gently astringent, and therefore 
may be given in the Room of Tormentil, or 
Bistort Root, to stop Fluxes [/25./]. 

From this Root and Camphire is prepar'd 
a Tincture call'd Tinctura Bezoardica, but the 
greatest Virtue is deriv'd from the Camphire. 

It has no Preparations, but is us'd as an 
Ingredient in Theriaca. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is a pentapetalous, 
pomiferous, climbing Plant, growing in Peru. 

[}§. 26. Costus amarus albus, Costmary. }]
IT is of an acrid, bitterish Taste, and of an 
aromatick Flavor, approaching to the Smell 
of Florentine Orris. 

It consists of a good many volatile and fixt 
Salts and Particles. 

It is a Cephalick and Nervine, because as 
an aromatick Flavor proceeds from volatile and 
|P_30
sulphureous Particles always exhaling, these 
Parts refresh the Spirits [/26./]: It is also Uterine, 
because the Salts attenuate the Viscosities every 
where, and warm that Part. It is an Anti- 
scorbutick and Antihydropick also, because these 
Salts absorb, as well Water as acid Salts, and 
carry them off by the Pores or Kidneys. It 
is stomachick, both because it attenuates vis- 
cous Humors, and so warms the Stomach; 
and because it contracts the Fibres, which are 
too much relax'd by Humors it is soak'd in. 

Its Preparations are Pil. Costi, and a di- 
still'd Oil, which are not in Use [/27./]. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is a pentapetalous 
Shrub, with a Fruit round as a Cherry, with 
a Stone wonderfully streaked. 

It may be gather'd at any Time, and be- 
ing dry'd in the Sun, it is brought to us from 
the Indies, where it is call'd Perho. 

[}§. 27. Costus amarus niger, Black Cost- 
mary. }]
IT is of an acrid and bitter Taste, and of 
an aromatick Smell. 

|P_31
It consists of a volatile, oily Salt, as may 
be discover'd, even by the Tongue and Touch. 

Its Virtues are the same as the former; 
but it is not so strong: It has the same Ge- 
nerical Mark also as the former. 

It is Anodyne, from its oily Parts sheathing 
sharp Salts; but it is not much in Use. 

[}§. 28. Costus Arabicus, Arabian Cost- 
mary. }]
IT is of an acrid and bitter Taste, and of 
an aromatick Flavor. 

It consists of fixt, and volatile, oily Salts; 
from whence it is us'd in the Bites of Vi- 
pers, because the volatile Particles expel the 
Poison [/28./]. 

It is Diaphoretick, and promotes Sweats by 
agitating the Blood. 

It has the same Generical Mark as Ginger, 
which see afterwards. 

[}§. 29. Cucumis Asininus, Wild Cucum- 
bers. }]
IT is of an acrid, bitter, ungrateful, nause- 
ous, viscous Taste, and smells whilst fresh. 

It consists as well of volatile as fixt Salts, 
envelop'd in a gross Oil and Earth. 

|P_32
Its Smell and Taste betray its Virtues, and 
accordingly it purges upwards and downwards; 
because its Salts stimulate egregiously both the 
Stomach and Guts, and raise a copious Secre- 
tion into those Parts. However, tho' it purges 
strongly when it begins, yet it is slow in its 
Operation, because its earthy and viscous Par- 
ticles blunt the Salts for a While; and, there- 
fore, it is quicken'd with seven Grains of Scam- 
mony, or some more powerful Incider, other- 
wise it wou'd raise Gripes. 

In a Dropsy and Cachexy it is us'd with 
Success, because it evacuates either Water, or 
Phlegm; and half an Ounce of Decoction is 
successfully us'd with other Diureticks. 

N. B. All pomiferous Plants have the same 
Virtues and Qualities. 

From the ripe Fruit wounded was made 
the Elaterium of the Ancients, and the Juice 
express'd from the Plant and inspissated, is the 
modern Elaterium. 

The Dose of the Root in Substance is to 
two Drams; in Decoction to half an Ounce; 
for the Elaterium is only given to half a Grain, 
or to two. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is a pomiferous, mo- 
nopetalous, flower'd Plant; and whose Flower 
is divided into five Jags, with a Fruit oval and 
hairy. 

It is call'd Asininus, because it grows where 
the Asses feed; and it is call'd Cucumis, as 
if we shou'd say curvimeris, from its curv'd 
Leaves. Varro. 

|P_33
We rarely use it in Substance, but in Ex- 
tract; which is made with Water, and not 
with Spirit of Wine: 'Tis boil'd in Water, 
and evaporated to an Extract. For Example, 

[}In a Dropsy. }]
TAKE Extract of wild Cucumbers fifteen 
Grains, Diagrydium three Grains, Oil of 
Cloves two Drops; mix, and make Pills. 

[}Or, }]
TAKE Extract of wild Cucumbers fifteen 
Grains, Mercurius dulcis half a Scruple, 
Electuary of Rose-Juice one Dram, Oil of 
Cloves two Drops; mix, and make a Bolus. 

[}Or, }]
TAKE Roots of Swallow-wort and Grass, 
of each two Ounces; Elicampane, Orris Flo- 
rentine, of each one Ounce; Flowers of El- 
der one Handful; Juniper Berries half an 
Ounce; Cloves half a Dram; mix, and in- 
fuse them in Wine. 

N. B. This is the least Diuretick of any 
Root consisting of fixt and volatile Salts. 

|P_34
[}§. 30. Curcuma, Turmerick. }]
IT is of an acrid, gently and gratefully bit- 
terish, and fattish Taste, and of an aroma- 
tick Flavor, somewhat like Ginger. 

It consists of volatile and fixt Salts, of 
some oily, viscous, and earthy Parts. 

The Manner of knowing what Particles 
Roots, &c. contain, is, that fragrant Herbs 
afford volatile Parts, and by Distillation an Oil 
swims upon Water, and what is at Bottom is 
bitter or fixt Salts, and earthy, according to 
the Quantity it affords after Lixiviation. 

Its Virtues: It incides, and attenuates; it 
is specifically stomachick, for it is [/29./] carmina- 
tive from the volatile Parts: It is uterine, and 
convenient in the Lochia retain'd, because these 
same Parts agitate the Mass of Blood, and pro- 
mote the Circulation, and consequently this 
Flux: It is used in Melancholy, because it 
proceeding from a gross and sour State, is cor- 
rected by the opposite or alcaline Parts of the 
Medicine. It is anodyne, by reason of its oily 
Particles. It is cephalick and nervine, from its 
picquant and volatile Parts. It is reputed good 
in Diseases of the Spleen and Liver; for, what- 
ever is bitter and pungent, or whatever opens 
and agitates, or takes off Obstructions and 
|P_35
makes the Blood circulate, is splenetick and he- 
patick: It is diuretick, by reason of its stimula- 
ting Salts. It is anti-arthritick, because the vo- 
latile Salts penetrate deep into the Vessels, 
and discharge the viscid Contents from thence, 
whilst the oily Parts ease the Pain. It expels 
the dead Fœtus, and helps Labour from the 
same Principles: I give it with Costmary and 
Opium in those Cases, that whilst the Pains 
are excited in a forcible manner, they may be 
more chearfully born. 

It is us'd in Powder to a Dram, with 
butter'd Beer; rarely in Decoction: It is us'd 
in Infusion with any spirituous Liquor. 

It affords an Oil which may successfully 
be us'd in nervous Cases. An Ointment is pre- 
par'd out of it, with red Sanders and Hogs- 
Lard, and is us'd in Obstructions of the Nerves. 

TheChinese season their Meat with it, 
and make a Snuff of its Powder for the Head. 
But the best manner of giving it is, as the Chi- 
nese do; they take this Root and moisten it 
with Water; they rub it in a Mortar, or upon 
a Marble, into a very fine Powder, which they 
give with fat Broth in splenetick Cases [/30./]. 

Its Generical Mark; It has a pentapeta- 
lous oblong Flower, ending in a Point from an 
ample Base, into oblong Ears, and round Seeds 
dispos'd in triangular Capsulæ. 

|P_36
[}§ 31. Cyclamen, Sow-bread. }]
IT is of a most hot, pungent, acrid and nau- 
seous Taste, if fresh, but of no Smell. It 
consists of very acrimonious Salts, which are 
mostly fixt ones; as also of some Oil. It 
purges by Vomit and Stool, and is us'd in 
Dropsies and Cachexies. Its Water apply'd to 
the Nose stops bleeding; and is a good Stopper 
of Blood in spittings of Blood too. 

It wants a Stimulus to set it on working, 
because it works but slowly. 

Its Preparations are unguentum Arthanitæ, 
which being apply'd to the Navel works 
downwards: The Root bruis'd and apply'd 
to the Part dissipates Tumors. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It has pentapetalous 
Flowers, tricapsular and angular Seeds, con- 
tain'd in round Capsulæ. 

[}§.32. Cynoglossum, Hounds-tongue. }]
IS of a mucous, sweetish Taste, and of a fetid 
Smell, resembling Flesh, which lasts not 
long. 

It consists of sulphureous and aculeated 
Particles, as the Smell proves. 

Its Virtues are to incrassate and astringe in 
Fluxes. It is us'd in a State of Juices, arising 
from acrimonious Salts; hence is it us'd in 
Bleedings, Gonorrhœa's, &c. It has an anodyne 
Faculty, and involves sharp Humors by its 
Oil: For the same Reason it is reckon'd con- 
solidating in Wounds. Its Juice is us'd as a 
|P_37
Narcotick, and with red Wine as an Astrin- 
gent. 

Its Preparations are Pil. de Cynoglosso, 
whose Dose is a Scruple, as a Narcotick. 

N. B. That which grows in marshy Pla- 
ces is the most effectual. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It has a monopeta- 
lous Flower, divided into five Jags. Its Seeds 
are like Dock-seeds compress'd, of the Shape of 
a Heart, four bare; the Top, in which the 
Heart lies, is downwards. 

[}§. 33. Cyperus rotundus, round Galin- 
gal. }]
IS of a hot, pungent, bitterish Taste, and of 
a pleasant Smell, like Spikenard. It consists 
of volatile and oily Salts, as appears by Distil- 
lation and the Smell; for it affords an aroma- 
tick Water, on which swims an Oil: It also 
consists of some few fixt Salts, which do not 
ascend, as appears by Incineration and its Bit- 
terness: In short, by Sublimation it affords a 
most fragrant Oil, and a volatile oily Salt, uni- 
ting and clustring together like Camphire. 

Whenceit Virtues are to incide, attenuate, 
and dissolve Grumes or coagulated Blood. 
It is from this Quarter reckon'd cephalick, 
stomachick, and cardiack in a fit Constitution, 
and is us'd specifically in Nausea's and Crudities, 
arising from a viscous or acid Offspring. It 
is a Pectoral in phlegmatick and moist Lungs. 
In all Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, or 
Mesentery, it is very conducive, because it first 
|P_38
attenuates and dissolves, and renders the Juices 
fit to circulate afresh. 

In the Indies it is us'd and prescrib'd to fa- 
cilitate Labour; to promote Urine and drive 
forth the dead Infant. 

It is us'd externally in Ulcers of the Skin, 
Mouth, and Jaws, and is us'd as a Sponge-tent 
to absorb sharp and corroding Humors. 

Its Preparations are Pulvis Diacypreos, which 
is deterging and anodyne, and is us'd to dry the 
Sweat of Hair. 

ItsGenerical Mark; Its Flowers and Leaves 
are stamineous, dispos'd into Shades like a 
Horse's Main, with Tassels on the Top of the 
Stalk, and triangular Seeds. 

N. B. The Cyperus longus, or English Ga- 
lingal, has the same Taste, Particles, Virtues, 
and Generical Mark with the former. 

[}§. 34. Dictamnus Creticus, Dittander 
of Crete. }]
IN Crete the Plant is hairy, and Leaves are 
hoary, but in our Gardens it loses its Hair; 
hence many are deceiv'd about it, and suppose 
our Dittander to be spurious, but it is the ge- 
nuine Plant, and is as truly aromatick with us, 
as in Crete; it enters into the Composition of 
Troches of Myrrh, and hastens Labour; the 
Leaves of it being dry'd, are us'd in Tea for 
a stoppage of the menstrual Flux. 

|P_39
[}§. 35. Doronicum, Leopards Bane. }]
IT is sweetish like Liquorice: It consists of 
smooth, oleous, and saline Particles blended 
together. 

As to its Virtues, it is temperate, and it is 
us'd in Diseases of the Head; in a Vertigo, to 
hinder or invelope those Fumes which disturb 
the animal Spirits. It is reputed a Poison to 
some Animals, but not to Men; so Nux vo- 
mica kills Dogs, and Garlick Wolves; and yet 
the former enters into the Composition of Elec- 
tuarium de Ovo. [/31./]

|P_40
It is emollient and lenient in Lungs parch'd 
and dry'd up, if we use it in Decoction, like 
Liquorice, whose Nature it approaches near 
to. 

It invelops acid Salts in the Blood, and is 
good in such a State. 

It is a corymbous discoidal, radiated, and 
pappescent Plant. 

[}§. 36. Ebulus, Elder. }]
IT is of a bitter Taste, and of a poisonous, 
or very nauseous Smell. 

It consists of fixt and some few volatile Salts, 
and some Oils. 

Its Virtues are to purge Serum by Stool 
and Urine; it is therefore us'd in the Gout 
and Dropsy, by reason of the Salts which stick 
to the Intestines and purge, and because some 
|P_41
of them pass into the Blood and stimulate the 
Kidneys. It is us'd also in Cachexies, for an 
Evacuant. 

N. B. All bacciferous Plants are diuretick. 

N. B. The interior Substance of the Root 
is rather styptick than purgative; wherefore it 
is given internally with red Wine for the 
Whites and too immoderate a Flux of the Men- 
strua. 

It is us'd externally in Fomentations, to 
disperse œdematous Tumors. 

It is rarely us'd in Substance, because its 
terrestrial Parts invelope its Salts so as to hin- 
der it from exercising its stimulating Parts. Its 
Extract made with Spirit of Wine is given to 
half a Scruple, or a whole one, to purge Serum. 
It is stimulated with Asarum, Elaterium, and 
such like. 

It is used in Infusion to three or four Oun- 
ces. 

[}§. 37. Eryngium, Eryngo. }]
IT is of a subacrid, bitterish, sweetish Taste, 
but has no Smell. 

It consists of smooth, viscous, oily Particles, 
and gently volatile Salts. 

N. B. All Sweets are viscid, because they 
contain sulphureous and acid Salts: Whence 
this Root is diuretick, and also provokes Ve- 
nery; because it stimulates by its Acrimony; 
and because by its sweet and viscous Parts it 
|P_42
affords [/32./] proper Nourishment, and encreases 
the Seed as do Almonds. 

By reason of its Viscosity it is us'd in a 
Consumption, in Hecticks, and in an Atrophy. 

It is mostly us'd in Substance, or Decoc- 
tion, or Electuary, or Candy. 

Physicians prefer the Sea Holly before 
the other, because it is more acrimonious: 
Its Leaves are thorny; its Flowers are ga- 
ther'd into Heads. 

[}In a Consumption. }]
Take Eryngo and Scorzonera Roots, of each 
three Ounces; Burdock, Salsaparilla, of each 
two Ounces; Fennel-seed 1 Ounce; Currans 
half an Ounce; mix, and make a Decoc- 
tion in Water. 

[}In stimulating Venery. }]
Take candied Eryngo, candied Satyrion, of each 
two Drams; Eggs, Fennel, of each one Dram; 
Ambergrease three Grains; Musk one Grain; 
Syrup of Lemons what suffices to make an 
Electuary. 

Welschius commends this Root against asim- 
ple Gonorrhœa. 

|P_43
[}In a Dropsy. }]
Take Eryngo and Scorzonera Roots, of each 
an Ounce and half; China, Salsaparilla, 
Sassafras, of each one Ounce; Grass Roots 
half an Ounce mix and make a Decoction 
in Water to be sweeten'd with the Syrup of 
the five opening Roots. To this Decoction 
may be added Juniper Berries. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is a capitated, spi- 
nose Plant, whose Thorns are only in the Leaves 
and Head, with solid Seeds. 

[}§. 38. Esula major, Spurge. }]
IT abounds with a pungent and most acrimo- 
nious milky Juice, and is nauseous. 

It consists of very caustick volatile Salts, 
with some Oils. 

It purges Serum in an Ascites Dropsy 
strongly: It is corrected with Acids, viscous 
Drugs, or Spirit of Wine, which is oily, and 
then its suppos'd Malignity vanishes. 

Its Dose in Substance; The Bark to half a 
Scruple: Its Extract with Spirit of Wine is gi- 
ven to one Scruple: Instead of Spirit of Wine 
to correct it, Vinegar, or aromatick Oils, of 
Cinnamon, Cloves, &c. may be added. 

N. B. Strong Purgatives are never to be gi- 
ven without Correctives. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is a tetrapetalous, 
and milky Plant, which has three Kernels, 
or Seeds. 

|P_44
[}§. 39. Esula minor, Lesser Spurge. }]
IT also abounds with an acrid, pungent, nau- 
seous, milky Juice. 

It consists of the same Particles as the for- 
mer; but is yet stronger. 

Hence is it of the same Efficacy with the 
former; but is stronger, and retains its Taste 
longer [/33./]. 

Its Preparations are, an Extract made of 
the Bark of the Root, which is good in purg- 
ing watry Humors: And it is to be remarked, 
that this Extract is to be made with a gentle 
Fire, [/34./] otherwise the volatile Parts fly off. 

[}In a Dropsy. }]
TAKE Extract of lesser Spurge half a Scruple, 
Resin of Jalap six Grains; Tartar vitrio- 
lated four Grains; Sugar'd Oil of Citron 
half a Dram; mix, and make a Bolus with 
Electuary of Roses. 

|P_54
[}Or, }]
TAKE Extract of lesser Spurge half a Scruple, 
Aloes Wood six Grains, Troches of Alhan- 
dal three Grains, one Drop of Oil of Cloves. 
Pour on Spirit of Wine tartaris'd; mix, and 
make a Tincture for a Dropsy. 

[}§. 40. Filix mas, Male Fern. }]
IT is of a bitterish, sweetish, subastringent 
Taste. Wherefore, 

It consists of fixt Salts, some Oils, and ter- 
restrial Particles. 

Its Virtues are gently to incide, to open, 
to attenuate, and to warm: It is also hepatick, 
uterine, and diuretick for the above-nam'd Rea- 
sons. It is us'd as a Specifick against Worms, 
because of its sweet Inveigling them to swal- 
low it, whom it kills [/35./] afterwards by its Acri- 
mony, and astringent Taste. 

It conduces in Burns, for the Root being 
bruis'd, a Mucilage exudes, which applied in- 
volves the igneous Particles, and lenifies the 
Pain. 

Its Dose in Substance is a Dram, in Me- 
theglin, or Mead. 

|P_46
ItsGenerical Mark; It is an Epiphyllosper- 
mous Plant (that is, its Seed grows on the 
Back-side of the Leaf). 

N. B. All Epiphyllospermous Plants are bit- 
terish, and as such are good in Obstructions, 
hypochondriack Disorders, and in Diseases of 
the Liver, Mesentery, Womb, &c.

It is also astringent; wherefore it is good 
in Fluxes. 

[}§. 41. Filix femina, Female Fern. }]
IT is of a bitterish and subastringent Taste. 

It contains the same Particles as the for- 
mer, and therefore has the same Virtues, but 
it is stronger. 

It is, as the former, Epiphyllospermous; 
and therefore is us'd in the same Cases, as it is, 
but is stronger and more effectual. 

We use it in deobstruent Decoctions, in a 
small Quantity, taking Care that it stick not to 
the Pleats of the Intestines. 

It has the letters I. E. naturally engraven 
in the Root; and for this Reason it is call'd 
the Root of Jesus Christ. 

[}§. 42. Fœniculum, Fennel. }]
IT is of a sweetish, subacrid Taste, and is a 
gentle Aromatick. 

Its Smell and Taste, as also its Analysis 
prove it to contain gentle, volatile, oily Salts. 

|P_47
Whence it is aperient and lenient also, be- 
cause of its Oil: It is diuretick, by Reason of its 
gentle Salts: It is specifically us'd in Diseases 
of the Lungs arising from a viscous Matter; and 
with Bezoar Mineral it is a noble Ophthal- 
mick (in Diseases of the Eyes arising from 
viscous and glutinous Humors. 

We use it in Infusion or Decoction, in 
which it deposits its gentle Salt, and is join'd 
with Eryngo-Root and Aniseeds. Its Dose 
is three Ounces. The Decoction of this Root 
with Burdock and Salsaparilla is exceeding good 
in Tremblings of the Joints arising from [/36./] Mer- 
cury, and against Weaknesses of the Limbs 
from the venereal Disease. 

It has no Preparations, unless that it en- 
ters into the Syrup of the sive Opening Roots, 
and Syrup of Althæa of Fernelius. 

ItsGenerical Mark; It is an [/37./] umbelli- 
ferous Plant; wheresore, as they usually are, 
it is opening, attenuating, diuretick, and car- 
minative. 


[^1. 
* N. B. Volatile Salts soon communicate their 
Virtues, and their Effects do soon vanish: On the 
other Hand, Fixt Salts take their Effect later, but their 
Efficacy lasts longer. 
^]
[^2. 
* N. B. Dr. Grew observes, that all umbelliferous 
Plants afford a Milk, which gather'd proves a Balsam, 
and appears to be a Gum, consisting of Oil, Acid and 
volatile Salt. 
^]
[^3. 
* N. B. Dr. Grew seems to think, that the Salts 
of some Plants require longer Time than others to ex- 
tricate themselves from their Adjuncts; which, when 
they have done, they then fix lastingly upon that Spot, 
and produce their Effects suitable to their specifick Na- 
ture; sure it is, that we find some Foundation for this 
in Practice, and in the Tasting of Plants it plainly ap- 
pears.

[^4. 
* N. B. A plain Instance of its volatile Salts is, 
that the Pulvis Ari Compositus, when kept any Time, 
loses its Pungency and Virtue. 
^]
[^5. 
* N. B. Great Regard is to be had to the Degree 
of Motion in the Juices; for if we give attenuating 
Remedies to Excess, they throw off too many of the 
watry Parts, and leave the Mass gross and thick: An 
easy Experiment shews us the Truth of this Advance, 
for Serum in a Spoon, plac'd over a Candle or Fire, 
soon grows thick and rheumatick, by a bare Evapora- 
tion of the necessary Quantity of Water which kept it 
fluid. Perhaps, this is the Case in a dismal, because 
mostly a fatal Fever, where there is an Ardor all over 
the Body, and yet where there is a small and weak 
Pulse; the Smalness of the Pulse depending upon a 
Want of Animal Spirits, which are too scantily sup- 
ply'd from such a viscid State; and the excessive Heat 
and Burning, on the acrimonious Parts lodg'd in the 
viscid, and buried in it. 
^]
[^6. 
* N. B. Ulcers are mostly generated from cor- 
roding Acids lurking in the Mass of Blood, and 
which corrode the Sulphurs of it into Matter, which 
never return to Blood again. Of this Solution of 
the Blood, it wou'd be easy to produce many Instan- 
ces, and to demonstrate it by Experiments, but I am 
not now at Leisure to shew how Matter may be made 
in a Moment of Time; I say mostly, because it is 
evident from Cantharides, that Ulcers may be occa- 
sion'd from acrimonious Salts of an alcaline Na- 
ture; since its Salt by Sublimation is so pungent and 
fierce as to blister the Tongue. 
^]
[^7. 
* N. B. Dr. Grew calls such Tastes malignant; 
and wheresoever Tastes become nauseous, it happens 
from the Parts striking the Sense of the Palat and Sto- 
mach disagreeably; we never wonder at great Sounds 
stunning our Ears, or too much Light blinding our 
Eyes for a While; for whatever strikes our Organs 
too forcibly, and vibrates the Fibres too quickly, be- 
comes disagreeable to them: What, therefore, strikes 
upon the Coats of the Palat and Stomach, becomes 
disagreeable to them, and is intitled Nauseous. 
^]
[^8. 
* N. B. In these Cases it is better us'd in Decoc- 
tion; because then it loses its Emetick Force, as Boh- 
mius well observes in his Offic. Medic. p. 474. and be- 
comes Diaphoretick; which more evidently shews, 
that its being nauseous is a Consequence of too many 
volatile Parts entangled with some gross Ones, which 
irritate irregularly. 
^]
[^9. 
* N. B. Salts in Plants cannot be properly term'd 
fixt, for by such are understood Lixivial Salts, or 
such as have suffer'd the Fire; however they may be 
call'd Alcalisate, inasmuch as they have really the Vir- 
tues of fixt Salts. 
^]
[^10. 
† N. B. There is, no Doubt, some Turpentine in 
this Root, as there is in the Heads, both which give 
this Factor to the Urine. 
^]
[^11. 
* N. B. I knew One, who labour'd greatly under 
Venereal Pains, of which he was reliev'd with a 
Decoction of this Root, when good Remedies had 
fail'd. 
^]
[^12. 
† N. B.Capitated Plants are Cabbage, Colly- 
flowers, Burdock, and such as grow with Heads upon 
them. 
^]
[^13. 
* N. B. Therefore it is cooling, for Nitre is the 
coolest of Salts. 
^]
[^14. 
† N. B. Earth alone gives no Taste; but if any 
Degree of Acidity be join'd to this Earth, then an 
|P_19
astringent Taste ensues, which purses up the Mouth 
in Proportion to the Earth and Acid join'd: And in 
Fact, this Mode of Taste is never produc'd without 
some Quantity of Acid join'd to the Earth, as ap- 
pears by Analysis and Composition also. For distil 
these earthy or astringent Medicines, and you meet 
with an acid Spirit in Plenty, a very little stink- 
ing Oil, and a pretty Deal of Terra damnata at Bot- 
tom of the Retort: So far for Analysis; and for Syn- 
thesis, 'tis very easy to compound these Tastes by pour- 
ing any Acids to a dry Earth. 
^]
[^15. 
* N. B. To contain Particles of an active Nature, 
and at the same Time sluggish and relaxing Principles, 
is to contain Corpuscles differing in their Operation: 
Contraries never fail of being disagreeable in some 
Manner or Degree to the Palat and Membranes, or, 
in other Terms, of being nauseous: All Discharges 
are made by Irritations, and they are occasion'd from 
Salts of different Natures. 
^]
[^16. 
† N. B. This, indeed, is the Case of Cantharides, 
when apply'd; Vinegar sprinkled on the blistring Pla- 
ster raises a Contest with the opposite Salts in the 
Flies, and makes it sooner exert its caustick Force 
on the Skin; and, as our Author observes under Can- 
tharides, Spirit of Vitriol does yet sooner raise a 
Struggle and a Blister, even in half an Hour's Time: 
However, one Caution must be given, namely, that 
we don't over-power the active Salts with Acids, for 
then we shou'd quite blunt them, and drown their 
Virtue. 
^]
[^17. 
* N. B. In the Gout the tendinous Parts become 
rigid, and unfit to bear a Load, or at least to circu- 
late a Quantity of active Salts deposited upon them; 
what, therefore, softens the Fibres unbends their 
Tension; and what opens the Pores evaporates a 
good Share of the Humors; which two Intentions 
being discretely answer'd contribute to shorten a Fit. 
The Diet order'd by the late Professors Boerhaave
and Oesterdyke, to a certain great Personage for an 
habitual Gout, if it succeeds, will prove how much 
the Blood is laden with saline and active Parts. 
^]
[^18. 
* N. B.To be friendly to the Nerves or Womb, is 
an Expression us'd in a restrictive Sense: For as most
Diseases of the Nerves and Womb, in our colder 
Climates especially, depend on a sluggish State of 
Motion, and on cohesive Qualities in the Mass, as 
also secondarily on a relax'd State of the Fibres: 
Those Remedies, which consist of volatile oily Salts, 
gratefully stimulate the Fibres, and, at the same time, 
do thus penetrate, agitate, incide, and attenuate the 
Blood; so that on Course, if the Nerves are relax'd 
or obstructed, or the Womb troubled with Obstructi- 
ons, or phlegmatick Fluxes, these Nervines or Ute- 
rines doing the good Offices of stringing and bracing 
up the Fibres, of evaporating the more serous Parts, 
and of undamming the Obstructions of the Parts, 
have justly merited those Appellations. 
^]
[^19. 
† N. B. Plants consisting of volatile Salts only 
don't bear boiling; but where these Salts are sheath'd 
with oily Particles, then do they bear gentle Boiling, 
the Oils hindring the Flight of the Salts. 
^]
[^20. 
* N. B. So Dulc-amara is reputed good in Asth- 
ma's from its sweet and bitterish Parts; and is call'd 
Solanum scandens, Circæa Monspeliensium, or Glycy- 
picros, and Solanum lignosum; but its Leaves should 
be cautiously us'd: It is hot, biting and bitter, and 
slimy also; so that if it has any Virtue in this 
Disease, it must act by stimulating the Trachæa by 
its warm, and expectorating the Phlegm by its glibbing 
Particles, and correcting the gross Humors con- 
tain'd. 
^]
[^21. 
* N. B. I tasted some fresh brought over, which 
had a Bitterness in it, and, therefore, has it a fixt Salt, 
which by Age flies off. 
^]
[^22. 
* N. B. A Salivation cures in the following Man- 
ner; the Mercury throws off all the Serum, in which 
principally lodges the poisonous Matter, the Globules 
all the while are well wash'd with innocent Liquors, 
or rather with such as contain Particles contrary to 
the Salts occasioning the Disease; for Example, the 
Decoction of the Woods, so that all the Liquors con- 
tain'd in the Mass are carry'd off or corrected, which 
when we have done, there remains nothing of cor- 
rupted Juices in the Channels; indeed, if any are ex- 
travas'd into the Bones or elsewhere, the Fault being 
local must be amended after the Salivation is over. 
^]
[^23. 
* N. B. Wounds have two General Intentions, 
Agglutination or Digestion; such Wounds are fit 
for the first Method of Cure as have lost no Sub- 
stance, or are made in a Part where an Eschar wou'd 
be unseemly; namely, the Face or Hands. 
^]
[^24. 
† N. B. A Callus is at first a liquid Matter, which 
in Process of Time is gelatinous, and lastly hardens 
into Bone; Papin's Digester reverses this Method of 
Nature; and, from an hard Substance, turns it back 
again to a Jelly: It must be concluded, that Com- 
frey, if it succeeds, contains a great many earthy Parts 
in it. 
^]
[^25. 
* N. B. A Drug, which is aromatick and acrid, 
as also at the same Time astringent, may be variously 
us'd, and serves many Intentions: First, It is speci- 
fick in low malignant Fevers attended with Fluxes: 
It acts upon the Solids and Fluids also with good Ad- 
vantage, by attenuating the latter, and straitning the 
former, and these, generally are call'd Bezoardick, 
their Consequences being high-priz'd. 
^]
[^26. 
* N. B. As the Spirits are observ'd to be recruited 
by Aromaticks and Fetids, we conclude the Particles 
these contain to be similar in their Nature to our Ani- 
mal Spirits circulating in the Nerves: It is no longer 
a Doubt, that the Nerves are hollow, since Inflating 
the optick Nerve shews its Structure to be porous, 
like a Cane, even to the naked Eye. 
^]
[^27. 
† N. B. There is also in our Dispensatory an 
Electuary, call'd Electuarium Caryocostinum, which 
is purgative. 
^]
[^28. 
* N. B. It is observ'd, that Persons dying of poi- 
sonous Bites have their Blood stronglier congeal'd, 
than if Spirit of Nitre had been injected. 
^]
[^29. 
* N. B. To be carminative, is to expel Wind; 
to do which we are to consider, that whilst our 
Juices ferment into Bubbles, and they, being of a 
tenacious Nature, don't readily crack, Wind swells 
us; and, as volatile Salts attenuate this Matter, and 
make them break, the Wind then readily escapes. 
^]
[^30. 
* It is not easy to know how this will relieve 
splenetick People. 
^]
[^31. 
* N. B. It does not enter into the Electuarium 
de Ovo in present Use amongst us, but heretofore it 
did; and the Physicians of Norimberg said, that Ex- 
perience had taught them, it kill'd Dogs, but did not 
hurt Men; and Jodocus Willichius mingled a large 
Quantity of it to an expulsive Powder; but Reno- 
dæus clears up the Matter, and tells us in his An- 
tidotar. Lib. 3. S. 3. C. 10. that it is an Emetick, 
and yet terms it Alexipharmick: And our Author, 
under the Title of Nux vomica, rejects its Use in 
this Composition. Indeed a small Quantity of Poi- 
son may turn an Emetick, a Purgative, a Diaphore- 
tick, a Diuretick, or an Alterative of gross Hu- 
mors, as we are taught by daily Experience: Then 
this need not be rejected; for, as all these Dischar- 
ges or Alterations are made by stimulating the Ves- 
sels, and giving them an oscillatory Motion, the 
Fluids will be thereby propell'd in any given or 
assign'd Proportion; as we see it happens to Persons 
under the excessive Coldness and Shiverings of a Fe- 
ver, that the strong vibration of the whole System 
of the Muscles moves the stagnating Fluids, and 
|P_40
drives them into Occursions, divides and agitates 
them, so that in a short space of time the Patients 
fall into excessive Heats, and at last into Sweats. 
And again, Do we not experience that Mercury Sub- 
limate, which is a strong Poison, is ventur'd upon, 
in small Doses, in the Aqua salivalis of Bates to 
pocky Persons as a Specifick: So that the whole Que- 
stion turns upon this Hinge, namely, Whether Poi- 
sons themselves may become innocent, and even profi- 
table? Which may be answer'd in the Affirmative, 
if we justly proportion their Doses. This also ap- 
pears in the Use of Cantharides, as Dr. Groenvelt
made it plain by Experience: So that in the main, 
if the ancient Elect. de Ovo had this Nut in it, and if 
it was well adjusted in its Dose, I can see no Reason 
why it should have been left out, even according to 
the strictest Scheme of the Moderns.

[^32. 
* N. B.Proper Nourishment, because all Secre- 
tions are promoted by their Similars; the grosser, by 
grosser Nourishment; and the thinner by Liquids. 
^]
[^33. 
* N. B. Wherefore does it abound with more 
fixt Salt than the former, which may also be cau- 
stick. 
^]
[^34. 
† N. B. Wherefore does it consist of volatile 
Salts. So that it consists of fixt and volatile Salts, 
both which are caustick. 
^]
[^35. 
* N. B. Worms bear no Diet, but the sweet, un- 
less accustom'd gradually to it; all other Medicines, 
or Nourishment are detrimental to them. 
^]
[^36. 
* N. B. Mercury by its great Astringency, when 
prepar'd, or made so, by absorbing the Salts of the 
Blood, leaves the Vessels too rigid; which abate of 
that Stiffness by oily volatile Salts: And we observe 
such Salts to take off this Astringency from Mercurial 
Preparations. 
^]
[^37. 
† N. B. Dr. Grew says, that such Plants afford 
a Milk, as I observ'd above.
