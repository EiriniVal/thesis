[}To cure the Rickets. }]
OPEN a Vein in both Ears between the 
junctures, mix a little Aqua-vitæ with the 
Blood, and with it anoint the Breast, Sides 
and Neck; then take 3 ounces of the green Oint- 
ment, and warm a little of it in a Spoon, and 
anoint the Wrists and Ancles as hot as it may be 
endured: do this for 9 Nights just before Bed-time; 
shift not the Shirt all the time. If the Veins do 
not appear, rub it with a little Lint dipp'd in Aqua- 
vitæ, or else cause the Child to cry, and that will 
make the Veins more visible, and bleed the better.

ing upon a Church or Oak 3 ounces scrap'd,

into a brass Kettle, setting it over the Fire, stir- 
ring it continually till it comes to the height of a 
Salve, which you may know by dropping a little 
on a Trencher; and if it neither hangs to the 
Trencher nor your Fingers it is enough: then dip 
your Cloths in, and when you take them out, throw 
them into a Pail of Water, and as they cool take 
them out and lay them on a Table, and clap them, 
and when you have done roll them up with Papers

little while; then take it off, and let it stand to

Leather. 'Tis an excellent Salve for sore Legs, 
Boils, Whitlows, sore Breasts, and may safely be 
used to draw Corruption out of any Sore; put a

ing black Salve over it.

Powder put a quart of Spring or Plantane-water: 
Boil the Water, and when 'tis blood-warm put in 
your half ounce of Powder, and stir it together in 
|P_288
a Pewter Bafon till 'tis quite cold; then put it 
in a Bottle for use. When you use it, shake the

of white Rosin, and two pound of Bees-Wax 
sliced, and boil it up to a Salve; and when 'tis cold 
enough, oil a Board, pour it on it, and make it 
up in Rolls: This is an admirable Salve when the 
Fire is taken out. You must take out the Fire 
with Oil, anoint it with Oil with a Feather; then 
lay on the Plaister. 'Tis good for a small Cut, or 
Issue inflamed. 

|P_289
[}A Green Salve. }]
TAKE 4 handfuls of Clowns All-heal, stamp 
it and put it in a Pot, and add to it 4 ounces

consumed, which is known when the Stuff doth not 
bubble at all: then strain it and put it on the Fire 
again, adding 2 Ounces of Venice Turpentine; 
let it boil a little and put it in Gallipots for use. 
Melt a little in a Spoon, and if the Cut or Wound
