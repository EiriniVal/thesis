[}I. The Practice of Purging and Vomiting Medicines, 
according to Dr. Cockburn's Solution of his Pro-
blem; with Tables shewing their Doses in particu-
lar Ages and Constitutions. Inscrib'd to the Learned 
Dr. Garth, F. R. S. by W. Cockburn, M. D. }]
BY my Solution of the Problem for determining the 
due Doses of Purging and Vomiting Medicines, [/1./] in 
all their Cases, it is manifest in general,[/2./] that these Medi-
cines operate either upon the account of their being mix-
ed with the Blood, [/3./] or by their stimulating the Stomach 
and Guts: 2. That this their Operation is more or less 
according to the Quantity and Thickness of Blood, h.e.[/4./]
a greater Quantity, and the thickest Blood require the 
greatest Doses: And 3, [/5./] that when the Quantities of 
Blood are the same, the Doses of Purging and Vomiting 
Medicines are in a duplicate proportion of the Bloods 
thickness. As also, that in every case these Doses must 
be in a proportion compounded of the Quantity of Blood 
and those Squares of its thickness. [/6./]

Now since the Operations of Purgative and Vomitive 
Medicines depend so much on the Quantity and Viscidity 
of the Blood, [/7./] which have not been duely consider'd be-
fore; it is no wonder that the Practice of Physick in these 
Evacuations has been so uncertain, and that the most ex-
pert Physicians, from their most accurate Observations, 
could never determine the true Doses of Medicines, which 
alter so much according to the various Subjects they work 
upon; they not being acquainted with the true Method 
of determining either the quantity of the Blood, or the 
degrees of its thickness. 

|P_2
Because Experience is equally the Foundation and 
Touchstone of all reasoning in Physick, we will here sub-
mit our Solution to common Observations, and try whe-
ther every thing proposed in it, does not exactly answer 
Matters of Fact, and the visible Operations of Na-
ture. 

First then, [/8./] it plainly follows, that these Medicines al-
ways purge best and most constantly in a liquid form; 
because they are more easily convey'd into the Blood, 
and can stimulate more parts, and that upon the account 
of this their Fluidity; whatever may be the way that 
Purges and Vomits work, or whatsoever their Nature 
may be. This explains very easily a very common Ob-
servation, hitherto very difficult to Physicians, about the 
different Operation of the same Medicine in different 
forms: Why, viz. the Infusion of a due quantity of a 
Purging Medicine produces its effects sooner and more 
constantly than a like quantity of the same Medicine in a 
Powder, tho' still more constantly in a Powder than a 
Bolus, tho' still sooner and more constantly in a dry Bo-
lus, than if it be given in Pills made into that form with 
Gums that do not purge; and this difference in Purging 
shall even be notable, according to the dissolubility of 
the Gums. 

From whence it follows, that the Evacuation made by 
such Medicines, is in proportion to the quantity of those 
Medicines that happens to be dissolv'd, and not to the 
quantity administer'd. 

Secondly, [/9./] That purging by Draughts is the most ex-
cellent form, and will always have the most constant 
effect. 

The next Consideration is, that a certain quantity of 
any purging Medicine affects us after a different manner, 
according to the different Quantity and Constitution of 
the Blood, or its thickness, and it was shewn in the So-
lution, that if its thickness were the same, the Dose 
|P_3
should always be as its Quantity, but the Blood differing 
likewise in thickness, the Doses of Purging and Vomiting 
Medicines must be augmented on account of its thickness. 
This is perfectly well confirm'd by daily experience; 
where we find, that People sick with a manifest thick-
ness of Blood, as in Dropsies, the Jaundice, &c. take far 
greater Doses than they did at any other time when they 
were not sick, or in that manner. 

By a further Disquisition into this matter, we find that 
the Doses must not only be greater where the thickness 
of Blood is greater; but that they must be encreas'd in a 
duplicate proportion of their Viscidity. This is evident 
by the Tables in Cassia. viz. 9:83::4:3ʒ, 1 ℈, 
13⅓ gr. and therefore alternando 9:4::8 ʒ:3 ʒ, 1 ℈, 
13 ⅓ gr. Therefore the Doses are as the Squares of the 
Constitutions. So likewise 9:8 ʒ::16:14 ʒ, 13 ⅓ gr.
and alternando 9:16::8 ʒ:14 ʒ, 13 ⅓ gr. h. e. the 
Doses are as the Squares of the Constitutions. 

The same is true in any other Constitution besides the 
mean: For Example, in the lowest and highest 4:16:: 
213 ⅓ gr: 853 ⅓. So that by this means we are not only 
led directly to a right use of these Medicines, and are able 
to find the true cause why the ordinary Doses produce so 
very different effects in different Constitutions; but like-
wise, [/10./]The Quantity of Blood in any Person being given 
together with the ordinary and extraordinary effect of a 
Dose of a Purging Medicine, the Change of that Persons 
Constitution, and the Nature of that Change may be deter-
min'd.

It cannot but be a great satisfaction to the mind to find 
a Doctrine founded on a few simple Experiences leading 
us into the cause of many more that are very complext, 
[/11./]
difficult, and obscure; which is sufficient to prove its 
conformity to Nature. But my present endeavour being 
to rectify the common Practice of these Medicines by this 
Doctrine, I shall frame, by this Method, Tables of the 
|P_4
Purging and Vomiting Medicines in present use; better 
adapted to Experience than are hitherto to be found. 

The Method of framing such Tables, [/12./] is by setting off 
the practicable Constitutions in the different Ages that I 
have observ'd to take notable Quantities of Purging and 
Vomiting Medicines; so that by comparing these Consti-
tutions with the Ages, we have the different Doses in all 
those cases, which is all that is requir'd for a better pra-
ctice; tho' a more proper occasion may produce a more 
nice and exact division of Constitutions, very much to 
the advantage of the Practice of Physick in all Diseases. 

The Ages wherein these different Doses are taken, I 
find to be four; when a Man is about 16 or 20 Years of 
Age, and weighs about 12 Stone, he then takes the com-
mon Dose: One of nine Years takes three quarters of 
that; one of six the half, and one of three Years a quarter. 
Moreover, [/13./] it having already been shewn, that the nota-
ble healthy Constitutions are but three, as also the nota-
ble Pulses of each of these: Let then these Constitutions 
be as 2, 3, 4. That of the most fluid Blood as 
the first number, and so on; in that case, the Dose of 
any Person will be found by multiplying the common 
Dose for his Age into the Square of his Constitution and 
dividing by the Square of the middle Constitution. For 
instance, If ℥j. Cassioe is the common Dose, or the Dose 
of the middle Constitution, ʒiij. ℈j. and gr. 13 ⅓ is the 
Dose of the first Constitution, and ʒxiv. gr. 13 ⅓ that of 
the grossest or last Constitution; and so proportionably 
for every Medicine in all the Ages, as appears by the 
Tables. 

This Method seems to answer so exactly, [/14./] that there is 
not any thing necessary besides, except a Person is more 
Loose or Costive than ordinary (which may be known 
from the Patient or otherways) it is to be reputed the 
same, as if he had taken an equivalent quantity of a Me-
dicine proper to produce these effects. Any Physician, 
|P_5
who has consider'd this case in some People after Flux-
ing, will allow the justness of this Exception. 

As Vomiting Medicines have the same common Doses 
with those that Purge, [/15./] they admit also of the like divi-
ded Doses; which, therefore may be found by the same 
Tables. Only, as People that are more Costive than or-
dinary require a proportionable greater Dose of a Purg-
ing Medicine: So they require their Dose of a Vomiting 
Medicine to be considerably less, as is very very well 
known in hot Countries. 

But it must be observed, that in the Tables, [/16./]Age stands Instead of Quantity of Blood; because they encrease pret-
ty equally, and it makes the practice more easie to such as 
are not accustom'd to Weights and Numbers. 

The more Skilful are desir'd to observe, that the mean 
Ages, [/17./]multiply'd into the mean Constitutions, give Doses 
more nicely. 

[}The TABLES. 
Some Instances shewing the Defects of the present Practice, 
and how mended by the foregoing Tables.}]
The Doses of the foregoing Tables, arising from Cal-
culation, agree perfectly well with the common Observa-
tion of the best Authors; tho' their Observation is very 
general and ill made, if we except the very first Steps. 
For instance, Authors of all Countries, English, Dutch, 
[/18./] German, Italian and French, reckon the Doses after the 
same manner; whereas, if they had been observ'd, they 
must have been different as are the Constitutions of Men 
in the different Countries. 

II. The defect of their Observation is manifest by the 
disproportion'd Doses of some Medicines, their high Do-
ses being sometimes double and sometimes triple, and 
|P_6
more of their low Doses, which is not conform to Na-
ture; for, let the low Dose be what it will, the high Dose 
of one Medicine must always bear the same proportion to 
the high Dose of another, as did their low Doses, viz.
even in Manna, they reckon it from ℥j: commonly to ℥iij. 
and ℥iv. If it is said that the first Dose is the lowest 
Dose that is taken by a Man of a due Age, it is neither 
true in fact nor conform to their own way of reckoning: 
For instance, Rhubarb is said to be taken from ʒj. to ʒij. 
No body will say that this is the lowest Dose taken by a 
Man of a due Age as formerly; because it is not in fact true, 
nor that the high natural Dose is ℥ss; for, as I said be-
fore, if ℥j. of Manna and ʒj, of Rhubarb are the respe-
ctive low Doses, then ℥iv and ʒij. cannot be the respective 
 high Doses. As to what concerns some extraordinary 
Doses given by themselves, and far exceeding the ordina-
ry Dose, is easily accounted for by the Solution. There 
are many Examples of this Nature: Turbith, viz. is com-
monly reckon'd among them from ʒj. to ʒij; yet Marg-
gravius, and good Authors, have given it to ʒiv. So Co-
locynthis from gr. vi. to gr. xij. and Fulgin. Fernel. Dun-
can. say they have given it to ʒβ. 

III. [/19./] Authors have been far from being exact; for they 
have only dos'd these Medicines for People of full Age; 
but have left the Doses of the different Ages in silence; 
nor have they told us at what time a Man takes his high-
est Dose, or how that alters in the Growth and Decline 
of Age, which is still a very great difficulty for the most 
experienc'd Physicians to manage. 

IV. [/20./] Their general Method is founded in a Mistake; 
their lowest Dose being really the common Dose taken 
by the generality of Men, which produces a multitude 
of Errours in the Practice. This is manifest in their do-
sing every Medicine. 

|P_7
V. [/21./] The mentioned Case is more manifest by these Ta-
bles, and it is two to one but that a Physician over Pur-
ges or under Purges any Person in Health; and if more 
Cases in Sickness are suppos'd, the odds will encrease pro-
portionably. Experience confirms this exactly: For if 
the middle Dose is given to one of the lowest Constitu-
tion, and the middle Dose is to purge 7 or 8 times; in 
that case, the Person of the lowest Constitution is purg'd 
near twice as much as he ought to be; and if given to 
one of the highest Constitution, he is purg'd but half of 
what he should be. But if the Dose of the highest Con-
stitution is given to one of the middle Constitution, he 
is purg'd twice as much as he ought to be; and if given 
to one of the lowest, he is purg'd four times as much, or 
about thirty times, as we find true by daily Experience. 
But if the Quantity of Blood, the Age, or Sickness con-
tribute to the Errour, it may prove fatal. If this Consi-
deration were illustrated by a proper number of Exam-
ples, we should find some hundreds of, otherways una-
voidable, Mistakes now prevented by the Practice of 
these Tables. 

Lastly, We may easily account, by these Tables, [/22./] for 
the Doses of Children over purging some People of good 
Health, and of due Age; a Phaenomenen so surprizing, 
that the smallness of the Dose is commonly thought a 
good Excuse for the Mistake. 

FINIS.
