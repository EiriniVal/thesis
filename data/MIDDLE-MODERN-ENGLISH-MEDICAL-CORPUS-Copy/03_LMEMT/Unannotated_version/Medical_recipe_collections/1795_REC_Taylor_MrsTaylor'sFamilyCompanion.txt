[}RECEIPTS in PHYSIC. }]
[}A good Electuary for an Asthma. }]
TAKE four cloves of garlic, roast them till 
they are soft; then bruise out the pulp, and 
put it into six spoonfuls of honey, two spoonfuls of 
the powder of elecampane, liquorice, anniseeds, 
and coriander-seeds, all finely powdered, of each 
one spoonful and a half; mix all well together, and 
take the bigness of a nutmeg morning and night. 

[}A Bolus for an Asthma. }]
You must take a dram of sperma-ceti, half a 
scruple of lac-sulphuris, volatile salt of amber five 
grains, conserve of hips one scruple, balsam of Peru 
ten drops, and syrup of saffron sufficient to make a 
bolus. 

[}A Dose for an Ague. }]
Give as much Virginia snake-root, dried and 
powdered, as will lie upon a shilling, in a glass of 
sherry or sack, just before the cold fit begins; use 
this two or three times till the ague is gone. 

|P_151
[}To prevent a Relapse of the Apoplexy. }]
Once every third day, at about four o'clock in 
the morning, take two scruples of Pilla Cochia the 
greater, and sleep after them; repeat it six times. 

[}A sneezing Powder for the Apoplexy. }]
Take one dram of the root of white hellebore, 
two drams of the flowers of lilies of the valley; 
mix, and reduce them to a powder, and blow it up 
the nostrils with a quill. 

[}The following Glister is good in an Apoplexy, 
Lethargy, Coma, or Palsy. }]
Get pellitory of Spain, half an ounce; coloquin- 
tida (tied up in a rag, or else it will gripe) half a 
dram; rue, two handfuls; boil it in water to twelve 
ounces; strain it, and add three ounces of crocus 
metallorum; tincture of castor, half an ounce; 
salt gem, and oil of amber, of each two drams, and 
mix all together. 

If it stay not with the patient, it must be repeat- 
ed; for it is no unusual thing in these cases for 
glisters to slip away presently, by reason that the 
intestines having their fibres benumbed, and para- 
lytically relaxed, lose their retentive faculty. 

[}A Drink for any Inward Bruise or Wound. }]
Take one handful of each of the following herbs, 
viz. wormwood, comfrey, throatwort, wood betony, 
plantane, mugwort, bonewort, scabious, avens, wild 
honey-suckle, agrimony, bramble-buds, cinquefoil, 
spearmint, sanicle, whitebottle, ribwort, daisy-roots, 
dandelion, bugloss, and hauthorn-buds: Put to these 
herbs two quarts of white-wine, and a gallon of 
|P_152
running water, and boil it till it is half wasted; 
then strain it, and add to it a quart of honey; let 
that boil in the liquor some time: When it is cold, 
bottle it very close, and keep it for use. It will 
keep for many years, and is necessary for all fami- 
lies; two or three spoonfuls of it to be taken morning 
and night. It is really good for fores, wounds, and 
hurts, new or old, in men, women, or children: 
Its virtues of that kind are too long to mention. 
It has broken and brought away inward imposthumes. 

[}A certain Cure for the Bite of a Mad Dog, by 
Dr. Mead. }]
Let the patient be blooded at the arm nine or 
ten ounces: Then take of the herb called in Latin, 
Lichen Cereneus Terrestris, in English, Ash-colour'd 
Ground Liverwort, cleaned, dried, and powdered, 
half an ounce; of black pepper powdered, two 
drams. Mix these well together, and divide the 
powder into four doses, one of which must be taken 
every morning fasting, for four mornings succes- 
sively, in half a pint of cow's milk warm. After 
these four doses are taken, the patient must go into 
the cold-bath, or a cold spring or river, every morn- 
ing fasting, for a month: He must be dipt all over, 
but not stay in (with his head above water) longer 
than half an minute, if the water be very cold. 
After this he must go in three times a week for a 
fortnight longer. 

N. B. The Lichen is a very common herb, and 
grows generally in sandy and barren soils all over 
England. The right time to gather them is in the 
months of October or November. 

Some advise, that as soon as possibly it can be 
done, the wound may be burnt with a hot iron; by 
which, part of the venom may be exhaled, and the 
 prevented from spreading itself any farther, 
|P_153
which good effect is very likely to follow from the 
pursing up the small vessels, and the coagulation of 
the adjacent fluids. 

[}A Plaister for the Breast, to dissolve curdled Milk. }]
Take sperma-ceti, one ounce; white wax, two 
ounces; galbanum, strained with vinegar, half an 
ounce; oil of elder, as much as will be sufficient to 
make a plaister; it is proper for all tumours of the 
breast, occasioned by the curdling of the milk, and 
is good in white soft swellings, or the evil in the 
breast, or any hard tumour in any part of the body. 

[}A Plaister to break a Sore-breast. }]
Seeth a lily-root and piece of leaven in milk 
till the root be soft; lay it plaister-wise to the part, 
morning and evening, as hot as you can bear it. 

[}A Cerecloth for Swellings in the Breast. }]
Make a cerecloth of oil of linseed and yellow 
wax, and apply it to the part, first anointing it with 
linseed-oil. 

[}To heal a Breast when broken. }]
Take a good handful of parsley, and a good slice 
of the fat of bacon, and stamp them together; put 
to it the yolk of an egg, and spread it plaister-wise 
upon a cloth, and lay it upon the breast. 

[}An excellent and tried Remedy for Burns. }]
Take two parts of the oil of walnuts, and one of 
honey; mix them well together over a gentle fire, 
and when they are thoroughly incorporated, dip a 
feather in the mixture, and anoint therewith the 
|P_154
part affected, so as the ointment may touch it im- 
mediately, and then strew on it some powder of 
ceterach, or spleen-wort, and keep the part quiet, 
and defend it from the air. 

[}For Burns and Stenching of Blood. }]
For stenching of blood, there are but few medi- 
cines which exceed the colcother of vitriol, whether 
washed and freed from its salt, or not washed. It 
is but a common thing, but will do more than a 
thousand much more enobled. 

[}A Family Ointment for Chilblains, Kibes, 
Whitloes, Felons, &c. }]
Take May butter, seven ounces; wax, resin, of 
each four ounces; crude honey, ten drams; wheat 
flour, six drams: Mix them, and spread it upon 
leather; apply it to the part affected; change it 
twice a day till it begins to grow well. It also 
warms, loosens, discusses, cleans, ripens, and digests, 
and is of known service in the speedy curing of 
felons and whitloes in the fingers; it is of singular 
use to abate inflammations, and bring swellings to 
ripeness and maturity. 

[}For the Cholic. }]
Slice one ounce of the very best rhubarb you can 
get into a quart of sack; let it infuse twelve hours 
at least; then drink four large spoonfuls, and fill 
your bottle up again: Drink this quantity once a 
day, for six weeks or two months, at least. When 
your rhubarb has lost its virtue, you must put fresh. 
This has cured some people, who could not find ease 
in opiates, nor the Bath; it must be constantly con- 
tinued till the bowels and blood are strengthened: 
It has done such marvellous cures, even where lau- 
|P_155
danum has failed, that it cannot be sufficiently 
commended. 

[}An infallible Cure for a Consumption. }]
Take half a pound of raisins of the sun stoned, a 
quarter of a pound of figs, a quarter of a pound of 
honey, half an ounce of Lucatella's balsam, half an 
ouncce of powder of steel, half an ounce of flour of 
elecampane, a grated nutmeg, one pound of double- 
refined sugar, pounded: Shred and pound all these 
together in a stone mortar; pour into it a pint of 
sallad oil by degrees; eat a bit of it four times a 
day, the bigness of a nutmeg; every morning drink 
a glass of old Malaga sack, with the yolk of a new- 
d egg, and as much flour of brimstone as will lie 
upon a six-pence; the next morning as much flour 
of elecampane, alternately. 

[}To cure a Cough and Shortness of Breath. }]
Take elecampane-roots, boil them very tender, 
 pulp them fine through a sieve; take their 
weight in the pulp of coddled pippins; if you have 
a pound weight of both together, boil it in a pint 
and half of clarified honey for half an hour; then 
take one ounce of powder of liquorice, and as much 
powder of anniseeds; mix all well together, and 
take a dram morning and night, and in the after- 
noon. It is an excellent medicine in an asthma. 

[}For a Hooping Cough, very good. }]
When you have got a quart of spring-water, put 
in it a large handful of chin-cups that grow upon 
, and a large handful of unset hyssop; boil it 
 pint, strain it off, and sweeten it with sugar- 
. Let the child, as oft as it coughs, take two 
spoonfuls at a time. 

|P_156
[}An excellent Powder for Convulsion Fits. }]
Get two drams of piony roots; misletoe of the 
oak, one dram; prepared pearl, white amber pre- 
pared, and coral prepared, of each half a dram;
bezoar, two grains, and five leaves of gold; make 
all these into a very fine powder, and give as much 
of it as will lie on a three-pence to a child of a 
month old, and proportionable to a bigger; mix 
it up with a spoonful of black-cherry water, which 
sweeten with the syrup of black cherries: Take it 
three days together, at every change of the moon 
to prevent returns. 

[}A Cure for the Cramp. }]
Take a handful of the herb called perriwinkle 
some of it bears a blue flower, and some white 
and also take a good handful of rosemary tops, put
them into a pewter dish, and set them upon coals 
dry them, and turn them very often, and when they 
are very hot, lay them upon the place that is 
taken with the cramp, and bind a cloth upon the 
when you go to bed, and this will help you; take 
off in the morning, and lay on fresh at night. 

[}A good Remedy for the Corns. }]
Get the yeast of beer, not ale, and spreading 
upon a linen rag, or other cloth, apply it to the
part affected, renewing it once every day. 

[}An excellent Purging Ale for the Dropsy. }]
Sena, four ounces; sassafras and tartar, of each
two ounces; jalap and liquorice, of each one ounce;
rhubarb, coriander, and anniseed, of each one
ounce; polypodium, eight ounces; broom ashes
one quart, and one ounce of cloves; put all in a
|P_157
bag, with some little weight to sink it: Take sca- 
bious and agrimony, of each three handfuls; of 
the roots of daneswort, one handful; raisins of the 
sun stoned, one pound, with a little ginger: Put 
these ingredients into sweet ale-wort, when you put 
in your hops, and let all boil together half an hour; 
then pour it scalding hot on your bag of drugs: 
When it is cold enough, set it to work with yeast: 
When it has done working, stop it up for twelve 
days, or a fortnight: Hang the bag of drugs in 
the vessel. Drink a large glass of this in the 
morning, and at four in the afternoon, unless you 
find it works too much at first; if so, lessen your 
dose; but take it daily, till you have taken all. 

[}Another Medicine for the Dropsy. }]
Take broom, and burn it by itself in a clean 
oven, shift the ashes from the stalks and coals that 
are not quite consumed, and put two full pounds of 
these ashes into a quart bottle; pour on old hock 
till the bottle is up to the neck; take care it is not 
too full; if it has no room to ferment, it will be apt 
to split the bottle: Digest it in hot ashes by the fire, 
or in the sun, and shake it often; when it has stood 
three or four days, pour off a quart of the clear lye; 
if it is perfectly fine, decant again and again till it 
is so; fill up your bottle again with hock, and do 
as before, till the strength of the ashes be out. 
Drink this first, and at four or five in the afternoon; 
continue it for some time, and it will carry off the 
dropsical humours. While you take it, let the meat 
you eat be dry roasted, and your drink strong ale or 
wine. 

[}To cure Deafness. }]
Take an equal quantity of good Hungary water, 
and oil of bitter almonds; beat them together, and 
|P_158
drop three drops in the ears going to bed; stop them 
with black wool, and repeat this nine nights at least. 

[}For a Pain in the Ear. }]
Get the juice of mountain sage, oil of fennel, 
oil of bitter almonds, and oil of olives, an equal 
quantity of each, and mix them well together;
drop into the pained ear three drops for three nights. 
It will ease and draw out any imposthume, if that 
be the cause. 

[}For an Earwig having got into the Ear. }]
Get rue, and beat it in a mortar; then strain off
the juice, and put it into the ear; then lie down
to rest on the contrary ear, and when you awake 
the juice will come out, and the ear-wig will be
dead. 

The juice of wormwood, of southernwood, and
rue, an equal quantity put into the ear, will all 
kill any vermin that has got into it. The stems of
coffee have often relieved a deafness that has been 
occasioned by the wax becoming too hard, which 
they will soften and set free. 

[}Dr. Willis's Specific for the Epilepsy. }]
Take the roots of male piony, dried and powder- 
ed, from one dram to two or three twice a day, 
the following tincture: 

Take leaves of misleto of the oak, two drams, 
piony roots sliced, half an ounce; castor, a dram;
let them be put in a close vessel with betony water 
or simple water and white-wine, of each one pound;
salt of misleto of the oak, or the common misleto 
two drams; digest them in a close vessel, in a sand 
heat for two days. Take three ounces with the 
powder above-mentioned. 

|P_159
[}A Draught for the Epilepsy. }]
Get powder of wild valerian root, one dram and 
a half; penny-royal water, and black-cherry water, 
of each one ounce and a half; syrup of pionies, 
two drams; mix them, and make a draught. 

[}A Drink for the King's Evil and Cancer. }]
Take guaiacum, one ounce; sassafras, sarsapa- 
rilla, sharp-pointed dock, and daisy-roots, of each 
half an ounce; arch-angel flowers, and millepedes, 
of each two large spoonfuls; ground-ivy, and herb- 
Robert, of each one handful: Bruise and shred all 
these ingredients, and put them to steep one night in 
three pints of good clear new ale; strain it, and 
drink no other drink for six weeks, spring and fall. 
You may do a larger quantity at a time for man or 
woman; but you must not infuse too much at a 
time, because the herbs are apt to change it; at 
the same time, if the swellings are painful, anoint 
with juice of rue, prepared as follows: 

Take two spoonfuls of juice of rue, as much sal- 
lad-oil, beat them well together; then set it over 
the fire, and let it boil slowly half an hour; add 
two ounces of bees-wax, let it boil a little with 
this: Pour it out, and keep it close covered. It is 
an incomparable ointment to use all the time you 
take the diet-drink. 

[}The red Powders for Fevers, Small-Pox, or 
Surseits. }]
Take of carduus, rue, red sage, lilies of the val- 
ley, tormentil, pimpernel, dragon, betony, angeli- 
ca, cabious, speedwell, of each one handful; worm- 
|P_160
wood, half a handful; agrimony, verum, of each 
a quarter of a handful: Shred the herbs very small, 
and infuse them in two quarts of white-wine, in a 
jug, which you must stop very close, and set nine 
days in the sun: Then strain the wine from the 
herbs, and infuse the same quantity of fresh herbs in 
the same wine; let it stand as before nine days 
more: Then take a pound of bole-armoniac, finely 
powdered, and put as much of the wine (after it is 
a second time pressed out) as the powder will take 
up, and set it in the sun to dry; and as it dries up, 
put in more of the wine, stirring it two or three 
times a day till all the wine is dried up in the 
powder, so as to be fit to work like paste: Then 
put to it of diacodium and mithridate, one ounce 
each; half an ounce of cochineal; of powder of 
red coral and prepared saffron, an ounce each; forty 
grains of bezoar; of powder of crabs-eyes, burnt 
hartshorn, and prepared pearl, an ounce each: 
Mix these in the last wetting, and work them all to- 
gether; make them into balls, when well mixed, 
and dry them in the sun. Take forty or fifty grains 
of this for a dose. Drink mace ale after it. 

[}A cooling Drink in a Fever or Pleurisy. }]
Put an ounce of pearl-barley into three pints of 
water, shift it twice; beat half an ounce of almonds, 
with a bit of lemon-peel, and a spoonful or two of 
the water; when they are very fine, wash the al- 
mond-milk through your sieve, with three pints of 
barley-water; in the last boiling of this you may 
put melon-seeds and pumpion-seeds, of each half an 
ounce; white poppy-seeds, half a dram; when these 
are well boiled, mix the liquor with the almonds, 
and strain all; sweeten it with syrup of lemons for a 
fever, or syrup of maiden-hair, and drink four 
ounces every three or four hours. 

|P_161
[}A speedy Remedy for Fits of Vomiting. }]
Having got a large nutmeg, grate one half of 
it, and toast the flat side of the other 'till the oily 
part begins to sweat out; then clap it to the pit of 
the patient's stomach as hot as can be endured, and 
keep it on whilst it continues warm, and then, if 
need be, put on another. This is recommended 
by the famous Mr. Boyle. 

[}To stop a Vomiting. }]
Take lemon-juice, half an ounce; salt of worm- 
wood a scruple; and a little white sugar: Mix, and 
make a Draught, to be repeated two or three times 
a day. 

[}To stop a Vomiting, and strengthen the Stomach. }]
Take spearmint, barley, and cinnamon waters, 
of each three ounces; plegue water, two ounces; 
salt of wormwood, a dram; lemon-juice, one ounce; 
three leave of gold; confection of hyacinth, two 
drams; syrup of red poppies, an ounce and a half: 
Mix, and give four spoonfuls every four hours, 
shaking the phial. 

[}For Vomiting and violent Looseness in a Child. }]
Bleed three times, and apply a cupping-glass 
to the navel. Take the red tops of gil-go-by-the- 
ground, dry them, and mix them with honey: It 
is good for any hoarseness: The tops are to be had 
in May, June, or July. 

[}A good Powder for Worms. }]
Take an ounce of worm-seed, and half an ounce 
of rhubarb, beat both to a fine powder, and take a 
|P_162
quarter of an ounce of prepared coral; mix all 
three together, and let the child take as much of 
this as will lie on a shilling, for three mornings 
together, drinking a small glass of warm ale after 
each dose. 

[}A Receipt to cure Worms. }]
Bruise a pound of worm-seed, and put it into a 
arge still of spearmint, and draw it off as long as 
it runs good: Let the child drink three spoonfuls 
of this nine mornings running. 

[}To stanch Blood in a Wound. }]
Take an ounce of copperass, made into fine pow- 
der, and half an ounce of bole armoniac powdered, 
and mingle them together, and cast some of this 
powder into the wound, and it will staunch the 
blood. 

[}For Wounds in the Head. }]
If these are attended with contusion, it may be 
proper to shave the adjoining parts. Some make 
use only of warm wine, oil, vinegar, or oxycrate, 
to embrocate them, or rub in. If the wound be 
recent, simple, and made by a sharp instrument, 
it may be immediately stitched up, and covered 
with Emplastr. de Minio; and this method is 
sometimes successful, even tho' the skull itself be 
cut, provided no ill symptoms indicate a contrary 
method.
