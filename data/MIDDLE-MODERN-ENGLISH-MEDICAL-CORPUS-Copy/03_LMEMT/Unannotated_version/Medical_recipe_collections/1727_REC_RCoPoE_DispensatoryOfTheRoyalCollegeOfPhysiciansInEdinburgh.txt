[}Aqua Spermatis Ranarum, }]
[}Frog-Spawn Water. }]
Hang any quantity of frog-spawn in a bag, 
so that the water may run from it, into a 
vessel set underneath to receive it; and to 
every pint of the liquor, thus obtain'd, add a 
dram of roch-alum. [/2./]

For the manner of procuring other simple 
waters, see among the chemical preparations, 
under the article of Essential Salts. [/3./]

|P_58
[}General Rules 
For the Distillation of 
SIMPLE WATERS. }]
I. The plants, with their several parts, ought 
to be fresh gather'd. [/4./]
II. Being first a little bruis'd, let twice their own 
quantity of spring-water be pour'd thereon; 
but less will suffice in case they are juicy. 
For every pint of water thus added, draw 
off half a pint, by the alembic, with its 
refrigeratory; the junctures being first lu- 
ted. But black-cherries require no water 
to be added to them. 
III. Those plants which abound with an a- 
romatic and fragrant oil, should be imme- 
diately committed to distillation: but those 
that contain a more fix'd oil, or owe part 
of their virtues to a kind of volatile salt, 
such as Wormwood, Carduus benedictus, 
Mugwort, Camomile, &c. ought first to 
undergo an imperfect fermentation, with 
yeast; that is, they should be distill'd in the 
|P_59
beginning of the fermentation, without 
staying till it is finish'd. [/5./]
IV. If any drops of oil float upon the sur- 
face of the water, they must be carefully 
taken off. [/6./]

[}Aqua Cinnamomi sine vino. }]
[}Cinnamon Water without spirit. }]
To a pound of Cinnamon add twelve 
pints of spring-water, and let them steep to- 
gether for two days; then draw off the water 
till it ceases to run milky. [/7./]

[}Aqua Cinnamomi cum vino. }]
[}Cinnamon Water with spirit. }]
Infuse a pound of Cinnamon in a Gallon 
of French Brandy, and distil off the water as 
the former. [/8./]

|P_60
[}Aqua Reginæ Hungariæ. }]
[}Hungary Water. }]
To two pounds of Rosemary flowers, add 
two quarts of rectified spirit of wine; and 
just as the flowers are fresh gather'd, let them 
immediately be distill'd. [/9./]

[}Compound waters. }]
[}Aqua Absinthij composita. }]
[}Compound Wormwood Water. }]
Take of Calamus aromaticus, Galangal, and 
Zedoary, each two ounces; the yellow part of

ounces; the leaves of common Wormwood, half a 
pound; those of Mint and Sage, each two ounces; 
the lesser Cardamoms, Mace and Nutmeg, each 
one ounce: slice or cut those ingredients that 
require it, bruise the others, and pour there- 
on two Gallons of French Brandy; let them 
sleep together for four days, then draw off 
two gallons by the alembic. [/10./]

each two ounces; those of Rue and Angelica, 
each one ounce; add two gallons of spring- 
water, and distil according to the rules of 
art.

will be the better, provided the Carduus, 
Wormwood and Scordium be first ferment- 
ed. [/11./]

|P_68
[}General Rules for the Di- 
stillation of Compound Waters. }]
I. The plants, together with their parts, should 
be moderately and newly dried; except in 
those cases where they are order'd fresh and 
green. 
II. After they have been duly macerated or di- 
gested, such a proportion of spring-water 
should be added thereto, as may, at least, 
prevent any empyreuma, or burnt flavour 
from the still. 
III. The quantity of the water drawn off 
need not always be precisely the same with 
that of the spirit [/20./] poured on; so as never 
|P_69
to exceed it: for distillation may be as con- 
tinued to advantage, as long as the wa- 
ter comes over milky. [/21./]
IV. The liquor that runs off first in distilla- 
tion, is sometimes kept separate, under the 
title of Spirit; and the succeeding part 
artificially fined down, or freed from its 
milkiness: but the best way is to mix the 
several runnings together, without clarifi- 
cation; so as that the waters may contain 
the full virtues of the respective plants, 
tho' they appear less clear, or pleasing to the 
eye, for it. [/22./]

[}General Rules for the Ex- 
tracting of Tinctures. }]
I. Let the Vegetables be such as were late- 
ly and moderately dried [/74./]; unless they are 
order'd fresh gather'd: They ought likewise 
to be sliced and bruised before the men- 
struum is put to them. 
II. When digestion is performed in Balneo,
the whole work depends upon well regu- 
lating the heat; which ought all along to 
be very gentle; unless where the ingre- 
dients are of a hard texture; in which 
case, the fire may at length be so far in- 
creased as to make them boil a little. 
III. Very capacious circulating vessels should 
be used for this purpose; and ought to 
be heated before their junctures are closed [/75./]. 
IV. The vessel should be frequently shook du- 
ring the time the digestion is in hand. 
V. Those Tinctures which will not clarify 
themselves, by letting fall their fæces to 
|P_98
the bottom of the glass, but remain thick 
and muddy, ought to pass the filtre [/76./].

[^1. 
* The shops were formerly burthen'd with an useless 
farr go of simple waters; the number whereof is here 
justly retrench'd, and only the more efficacious retain'd. 
It is certain, that nearly the whole number here set 
down possess the medicinal virtues of the respe-
ctive simples; whereas in abundance of Pharmaco-
pœia's we have several simple waters that can lay 
no great claim thereto; such are those of Succory, Fuma-
tory, Plantain, Oak, &c. and even of the present cata-
logue there might lie some objection against the Carduus, 
Mugwort, and red-Poppy Water; which should seem 
as is but too common, retain'd more out of custom than 
from any certainty of their being impregnated with the 
virtues of the plants; since they contain so little essen-
|P_57
tial oil. But this objection is entirely set aside by 
the following rule, wherein such kind of plants are ex-
presly order'd to be imperfectly fermented before distil-
lation; which so unlocks the substance thereof, as to per-
mit their efficacious parts to rise. And this may give 
us a specimen how thoroughly acquainted the compilers 
of the dispensatory were with the natures of things, and 
how well qualified for the work they undertook. But 
for a fuller illustration of this point, and ascertaining the 
precise doctrine it leads to, we must refer to Boerhaave's 
New Method of Chemistry, where these matters are very 
instructively handled. Practice, pag. 57. 69. 
^]
[^2. 
* This is a much better Frog-Spawn-Water than we 
find order'd in other dispensatories; the addition of the 
alum, and the manner of preparation, by resolution, 
considerably increase its virtues; whereas that ob- 
tain'd by bare distillation gives us little more of the 
spawn than its useless phlegm. As it stands here, it 
seems design'd as a cooler, for external uses. 
^]
[^3. 
† Where such Waters are judiciously order'd to be 
made by dissolving in clear spring-water, the essential 
salts of the more fix'd vegetables, that yield no virtue 
by distillation. Which is prescribing with a thorough 
mastery of both the Pharmacies. 
^]
[^4. 
* For thus alone you will obtain their fine vola-
tile parts; or, to speak in the language of that ad-
mirable chemist Boerhaave, the native, or presiding 
spirit thereof. But if this be the sole point in view 
'tis better not at all to bruise, or so much as crush the 
subject. See Boerhaave's New Method of Chemistry
pag. 12, 20. Pract. ^]
[^5. 
* For if the fermentation be once finish'd, the oily 
part of the plant is become inflammable spirit. ^]
[^6. 
† Otherwise essential oil might come to be given in-
stead of a simple water; this therefore renders the water 
the purer, and fitter for immediate use: but then it will 
not keep so long, nor prove so strong as if the oil were 
suffer'd to remain a-top. ^]
[^7. 
‖ It is judiciously prescrib'd by Dr. Fuller, to add an 
ounce of white sugar-candy to each pint of this water, 
in order to prevent the separation of the ponderous 
oil; for want of which addition, or something like 
it, the small cinnamon water of the shops will not long 
keep good. 
^]
[^8. 
‖‖ If this water be required exceedingly fine, clear, 
and well flavour'd, it should not be drawn below proof, 
as the distillers call it; or no lower, or more aqueous 
than pure Brandy: but as here order'd, it seems de- 
|P_60
sign'd to be drawn considerably lower; as indeed it must, 
to gain the full virtues of so large a proportion of 
Cinnamon; in which case it will turn milky, like the 
former; a due quantity of spring-water being put into 
the still to answer that demand. 
^]
[^9. 
* This ought to be done in Balneo mariæ, without 
the addition of water; which might take off from the 
delicate, native flavour of the Rosemary-Flowers. 
^]
[^10. 
† This appears to be an excellent compound Worm- 
wood water; the addition of the Orange-peel, which o- 
|P_61
thers omit, will make it wonderfully grateful, stomachic 
and cardiac; but the oily ingredients being in so large 
a proportion, 'tis judiciously order'd to draw off no 
more than the quantity of spirit pour'd on; that is, not 
below proof, otherwise the oils would turn the water 
milky, and make it displeasing to the eye, and apt to 
rise ungrateful upon the stomach. 
^]
[^11. 
* That is, fermented only in part, till the bodies of 
the plants are so far open'd as to afford their proper 
medicinal virtues by distillation, without turning to in- 
flammable spirit; as was directed by the preceding rules, 
for the distillation of simple waters. By the way, we 
may here observe the difference made by the judicious 
compilers between simple and compound waters: the 
vulgar esteem those as simple waters which are made 
without spirit, only by the distillation of vegetables, 
whether one or more, and spring-water; and those as 
compound waters, which are prepar'd with spirit; tho' 
it be only from a single ingredient: thus both small and 
strong cinnamon water, Hungary water, &c. in some 
Dispensatories are found among the compounds; but 
|P_62
with the Royal College of Edinburg, that deserves to 
be call'd a simple water, which is made from one simple 
ingredient; and that a compound, which is made from 
more; whether the liquor added in either case be aque- 
ous, spirituous, or both. Thus under the title of simple 
waters, or rather, (which shews their great exactness, 
after the catalogue of aqueous simple waters, come Cin- 
namon water and Hungary water, as being prepar'd 
from single ingredients; and among the compounds 
Alexiterial water, as drawn from several plants; tho 
not a drop of inflammable spirit enters its composi- 
tion. 
^]
[^12. 
* The compound Bryony water of the Dispensatory of
the Royal College of London seems to promise fairer than 
this for an hysteric, on account of the myrrh and castor 
they add; but the authors of the present, doubtless con- 
sider'd that little of either, suitable to this intention, and 
especially of the myrrh, would rise by distillation 
so play'd the good husband, and shew'd their sagacity 
|P_63
in dropping 'em; having otherwise treated each in 
a suitable manner, to gain their medicinal parts and 
virtues. See Tincture of Myrrh, and Tincture of 
Castor. 
^]
[^13. 
* This composition is not, like the Plague-water of 
other Dispensatories, clogg'd with useless ingredients, 
that afford nothing proper to the intention, by distilla- 
tion; such as Celandine, Carduus, Centory, Gentian, 
&c. but is directed with discernment, and design'd as a 
high carminative cordial in malignant cases, or great de- 
pressions. 
^]
[^14. 
* This is an excellent Aqua mirabilis; the ad- 
dition of the Citron-peel, Cinnamon and Baulm, ren- 
ders it very agreeable to the stomach, and greatly in- 
creases its cordial virtues; Cinnamon, as Dr. Fuller
judiciously observes, being one of the most pleasant, as 
well as most effectual of all the stomachic spices. And 
the like may be said of Citron-peel. We may likewise 
observe with what judgment the Juice of Celandine, re- 
tain'd by some other Dispensatories of prime note, is here 
drop'd by the Royal College of Edinburg, as of no manner 
of significancy. The original author of the composition, 
says Dr. Fuller, doubtless, observing the drinkers of strong 
waters very much inclin'd to the Jaundice, was willing 
to give them a specific for that disease, in form of a spi- 
rituous liquor, and therefore order'd the Juice of Ce- 
landine in this water: but this, the Doctor observes, 
was very ridiculous; because that juice, by distillation 
yields none of its bitter, acrimonious flavour, or medi- 
cinal virtue; but only a meer insipid and ineffiacious 
phlegm. 
^]
[^15. 
* On the footing of the present practice, this water is 
very well contriv'd to answer its original intention, that 
of a diuretic, or lithontriptic: the St. John's-wort in- 
deed may be objected to in distillation; but it is no less 
celebrated for its pungent volatile parts, than its nephritic 
virtue. The Elder-Flowers likewise will hardly pass 
without censure, unless it be recollected that they afford 
a well-scented water by distillation, and are allow'd to 
be discutient as well as emollient and anodyne; so that 
these being all the exceptionable ingredients in this 
composition; if they be granted not unsuitable, the rest 
are certainly excellent, and well adapted. 
^]
[^16. 
‖ The compound Piony Water of the Royal College 
of London, is, in the opinion of a candid judge, very 
faulty in its contrivance, who therefore, with due sub- 
mission, offers an amendment thereof; but to this I be- 
|P_66
lieve he would have no objection to make, no amend- 
ment to offer; so elegant, skilful, and efficacious is the 
composition, and yet so simple. 
^]
[^17. 
* It is doubtless much better here to use the bruis'd 
leaves of the scurvy-grass and cresses, than their ex- 
press'd aqueous juice; as, with the addition of an ex- 
traordinary and detrimental trouble, is order'd by others, 
for after the expression, a large proportion of the salt, or
volatile pungent part remains in the pressings, which to 
the making of the essential salt of any vegetable are al- 
ways well wash'd with water to get it out. 
^]
[^18. 
† The green walnut-husks are here very judiciously 
order'd in substance, instead of the juice thereof pre- 
scrib'd by others; as containing more of the efficacious
parts in proportion, capable of rising by distillation: The
|P_67
Lemmon Juice too, adopted by some in this composi- 
tion, is here dropp'd, the distill'd vinegar, put into 
the water after distillation, richly supplying its place; 
and much better answering the intentions of a su- 
dorific, and an alexipharmic; which seem principal- 
ly aim'd at in this excellent composition. But instead 
of distill'd Vinegar, some unadvisedly add a correspond- 
ing proportion of spirit of Vitriol, or other mineral acid 
to their Treacle-water; which considerably alters the 
nature of the medicine. Vinegar is an acid made by a 
double fermentation, a thing sui generis, and not to be 
match'd by the acid juices of vegetables, whether Oran- 
ges, Lemmons, Citrons, Crabs, Barberries, &c. nor by 
those of minerals, whether Vitriol, Sulphur, &c. from 
all which it differs almost as much as from any thing 
else: true, it is acid upon the tongue like them; but 
it liquifies the blood, is antipestilential, suddenly cures 
drunkenness, surfeits, the plague, and does a thousand 
things, both as a medicine and a menstruum, which they 
will not. For proof of this, see the History of Vinegar in 
Boerhaave's New Method of Chemistry. 
^]
[^19. 
* We have here in small compass, and without any 
great apparatus, a sufficient stock of compound waters, 
which may easily be made to answer all the intentions 
that can at any time require their assistance. The 
Aqua Absinthij composita is a very good stomachic; the 
Aqua alexitaria, an innocent, but powerful alexipharmic; 
the Aqua Bryonia composita, an excellent hysteric; the 
Aqua Epidemia, an invigorating carminative, the Aqua 
|P_68
mirabilis, an excellent cordial; the Aqua Petroselini, 
an effectual diuretic; the Aqua Pæonia composita, a ve- 
ry good cephalic; the Aqua Raphani composita, a fine 
antiscorbutic; and the Aqua Theriacalis, an admira- 
ble and sprightly sudorific: so that it is hard to say what 
of this kind could be farther desir'd, and at the same 
time well suited to the form and use of a compound wa- 
ter, to render the set more compleat; which again 
gives us to see the judgment wherewith this Dispensa- 
tory was compiled: Always to order but just what is 
sufficient, in the most suitable and effectual manner, be- 
speaks uncommon skill and sagacity in the prescriber. 
And this the reader cannot but be delighted to observe 
in the course of this Dispensatory; which to have 
here, once for all, remark'd, to give him the clue, will, 
we apprehend, be sufficient. 
^]
[^20. 
* Dr. Fuller, with good reason, wou'd have all com-
pound waters distill'd from highly rectified spirit of wine, 
and pure water; by which means not only the composition 
|P_69
will be untainted with the nauseous and fetid phlegm, 
constantly remaining in Brandies and the common Spirits 
sold by Distillers; but also a certain rule will be had 
for making the same waters, at all times and seasons, of 
the same degree of strength; and that too at a cheaper 
rate, than by trusting to what the Distillers call proof 
Goods: since one gallon of well rectified spirit of wine will 
give three of a compound water, as the Doctor judges, 
sufficiently strong. ^]
[^21. 
* That is, as long as the essential oil continues to a-
scend in any quantity; for this mixing its small particles 
along with the phlegm or water, is what gives the milky 
cast. ^]
[^22. 
† The reasons of these several rules are admirably de-
duced by the dilgent Boerhaave, in his New Method of 
Chemistry; to which we, therefore, refer the Reader, 
who desires to see how just and rational they are, and 
from what depth of pharmaceutical knowledge deriv'd. 
See Practice, p. 16, 18, 57, 69, & alibi passim. ^]
[^23. 
* This is vulgarly call'd plain or white spirit of scurvy- 
grass, to distinguish it from a compound, red sort, com- 
monly sold by the name of golden, or purging spirit of 
scurvy-grass; which is made by dissolving an ounce of 
Rosin of Jalap, Scammony or Gamboge in the former. 
See Quincy's compleat Dispensatory, p. 339. Edit. 5.
^]
[^24. 
* The Borrage, Bugloss, and Cowslips, which enter 
the spirit of Lavender in the London Dispensatory, are 
here drop'd, as of no significance to a high cephalic me- 
dicine; and otherwise affording scarce any of their me- 
dicinal parts by distillation: indeed the composition, as 
it stands here, appears every way excellent, and worthy 
of the great character it bears. 
^]
[^25. 
* This is an excellent receipt for sal volatile oleosum, 
as 'tis vulgarly call'd; the operation is to be perform'd 
as usual in the like cases, in a sand-heat, and continued 
till the phlegmy part of the spirit begins to rise and dis- 
solve the salt that pefore had fasten'd itself to the neck of 
the retort and receiver. See Quincy's compleat Dispen- 
satory, p. 306. 
^]
[^26. 
* The operator should be cautions to avoid the 
steams in the evaporation; because they are poison- 
ous. The liquor, according to Dr. Fuller, ought to stand 
five days at rest, for the fæces to subside, before the 
clear is filtred off for use. Fallopius is the original au- 
thor of this water; who contrived it for cuticular erup- 
tions, pustules and small ulcers. But he seldom, for 
this purpose, made use of it alone, as being too cor- 
rosive; but diluted it sometimes with twice, sometimes 
with thrice, and sometimes with four times its own 
quantity of Rose-water. 
^]
[^27. 
* In this operation also the rising vapor should be a- 
voided, as noxious. The water seems design'd to bathe 
the gouty parts; and by that means either to open the 
pores, so as to let the peccant matter transude; or else, 
by the specific property of the salts contain'd in the 
ingredients, to dissolve, mortify, or change its texture, 
so as to render it harmless. 
^]
[^28. 
† This is an excellent Water, for internal as well as 
external uses; 'tis not only approved of for inflamma- 
tions, burns, cutaneous eruptions, the erysipelas, old 
ulcers, gangrenes, &c. but 'tis also famous for its virtues 
in catarrhs, the phthisic, dropsy, diabetes, and parti- 
cularly the scurvy in northern climates: but how it 
comes to be eminently serviceable in England, Holland, 
&c. against scurvy, and as remarkably detrimental in the 
same distemper in Italy, the southern parts of France, 
&c. is what perplex'd some eminent members of the 
royal Academy of Sciences of Paris; but is hand- 
somely accounted for by the judicious Boerhaave, in his 
New Method of Chemistry, pag. 192. Pract.
^]
[^29. 
* This simple eye-water hath all the virtues of other 
more elaborate compositions; and seems derived from 
solid experience, which confirms it excellent; rather 
than a pompous theory. 
^]
[^30. 
† This has nearly the same virtues as the Aqua Cam-
phorata; so much commended by Dr. Quincy, is his 
Compleat Dispensatory, p. 375. 
^]
[^31. 
‖ The title of this water sufficiently denotes its vir- 
tues and use; as being a good lotion for old eating ul- 
cers, if occasionally diluted with water, or mix'd 
with spirit of wine, &c. 
^]
[^32. 
* This water is chiefly used for taking away specks 
or curing ulcers in the eyes; two or three drops be- 
ing suffer'd to fall thereon at a time. 
^]
[^33. 
† This is much the same with Dr. Sydenham's styp- 
tic water; the phlegm of Vitriol being here dropt, and 
its place more commodiously supplied by spring-water. 
^]
[^34. 
‖ That is, to carry off the phlegm; which will rise 
better with so gentle a heat, in a flat earthen pan, than 
by being distill'd per retortam. 
^]

* As the heavier acid is to be raised.

[^36. 
† The Vinegar of Roses, as Dr. Quincy observes, is 
seldom used but in embrocations, for the head or tem- 
ples, in some kinds of the head-ach; where it frequent- 
ly does great service: tho' it might likewise be usefully 
added to Juleps, Draughts, or the like, in malignant 
fevers; where cordial acids are required. 
^]
[^37. 
‖ This medicated Vinegar is not so much in use a- 
mong us as it seems to deserve; we seldom order it 
but in Oxymel scilliticum; tho' when used alone it 
powerfully breaks away viscid phlegm, and expectorates 
or vomits with great success, in phthisical, and asth- 
matical cases; and possibly the better for not being 
clogg'd with honey. 
^]
[^38. 
* This promises very fair for being an admirable me- 
dicated Vinegar; and in many cases preferable to Trea- 
cle-water; as particularly where a sudden sweat is re- 
quired, a venomous bite, or any infection received, 
&c. on which account something like it richly deserves 
a place in all publick dispensatories; and consequently 
in the shops: in its stead, the Tinctura Theriacalis
of the London Dispensatory may be used in some cases. 

The compilers have in this article of Vinegars, avoid- 
ed as well the wrong-judged copia of the German, as 
the penury of some other Dispensatories: the best and 
most efficacious are here retain'd; and which, by a suit- 
able contrivance in the extemporaneous prescriber, may 
well answer the ends to be rationally expected from 
so noble a menstruum and medicine as vinegar; for 
the virtues and uses whereof, we must refer to the judi- 
cious Boerhaave, who in the New Method of Chemistry, 
gives us its full chemical History. Pract. p. 142—152.

* Observe, that not a drop of water remain in the 
mortar; otherwise it might fly in pieces, and do con- 
siderable damage.

[^40. 
* This Tincture is little more than a tincture of salt 
of Tartar, impregnated with the sulphur of antimony; 
the metalline part whereof will not be taken up by spi- 
rit of wine. It is accounted sudorific and hysteric; 
and thought to possess the virtues of the common Tinc-
tura metallorum. But what is rationally to be expected 
from this medicine, we cannot know better than from 
the learned Boerhaave, in his chemical history of An- 
timony. See New Method of Chemistry, pag. 303,—322.

[^42. 
* This appears to be a very judicious prescription; 
wherein the Cantharides are match'd so well, as to 
prove wonderfully serviceable in all those cases that re- 
quire their assistance: but lest they should be apt to 
cause excoriations, or do other mischief, the wary com- 
pilers have left their grand corrector, Camphire, to be 
added at discretion. It seems to be a better prepa- 
ration than that troublesome one so higly magnified by 
Dr. Quincy, and deserves the same character; especial- 
ly for gleets and feminal weaknesses, when other reme- 
dies fail. See Quincy's Dispensat. p. 324, 325. 
^]
[^43. 
† The addition of the salt of Tartar is here well suit- 
ed to unlock the resinous texture of the Castor; by 
which means the menstruum will take up much more 
of the ingredient, than otherwise; and not leave so 
large a bottom, as when Spirit of Castor, if ever that 
be applied for this purpose, or Spirit of Wine, alone, 
is used to extract the tincture. 
^]
[^44. 
* And likewise, according to the Royal College of 
London, with Treacle-water; tho' by this means, on 
account of the acid in the Treacle-water, the tincture 
is soon lost again. 
^]
[^45. 
† This tincture is composed of the most efficacious 
and best approved ingredients cull'd out of the tribe of 
anti-epileptics, judiciously combined with such pur- 
gatives or deobstruents as are suitable to so stubborn a 
disease as the falling-sickness. The design of the me- 
dicine, however, is not to purge strongly, but only to 
keep the body soluble, whilst the cephalics work their 
effect: for which end it may be taken pretty liberal- 
ly; or in the quantity of two or three spoonfuls, twice 
or thrice a day; to act as a specific. 
^]
[^46. 
* From the nature of the ingredients, and the manner 
of the preparation, this tincture, must be considerably 
styptic, or astringent. Blood-stone contains a copious 
iron; sal-ammoniac is excellently adapted to unlock the 
bodies of metals; and Wine is no improper dissolvent 
of iron: so that the menstruum may here be well im- 
pregnated with the particles of the stone, and conse- 
quently thus prove serviceable in hæmorrhages, diar- 
rhœa's, &c.

tues of Jalap, both saline and resinous; See Boerhaave's 
New Method of Chemistry, p. 159. Pract.
^]
[^49. 
† The way of making this tincture is prescrib'd like 
a master of pharmacy; for unless the Gums were first 
mix'd with salt of Tartar, and expos'd to a moist air, 
and then dried, they would hardly yield any tincture at 
all to the menstruum. But for fuller instructions rela- 
ting to this point, the reader may consult Boerhaave's 
New Method of Chemistry, where he will receive ample 
satisfaction. See p. 157, 164. Pract.

[^50. 
* This is an ingenious contrivance for making tar- 
tariz'd Tincture of Iron; and will no doubt prove much 
more effectual than the Chalybs cum Tartaro præparatus
in all those cases where that is reputed proper; for 
which therefore it may well serve as a substitute. 
^]
[^51. 
† Of the several ways hitherto propos'd for making 
Mynsicht's Tincture of Iron, this seems to be the best, 
on account of the larger proportion of sal-ammoniac al- 
low'd, the manner of the process, and the nature of the 
menstruum. See Boerhave's New Method of Chemistry, 
p. 265, 266, 269, 270. Pract.
^]
[^52. 
* The manner of preparing this Tincture is excel- 
lent; and the menstruum admirably well suited to ex- 
tract the virtues of the metal. See Boerhaave's New 
Method of Chemistry, pag. 268, 270. Pract.
^]
[^53. 
The evaporation of the superfluous humidity, in 
this operation, is a great help to the dissolution of the 
myrrh; though it be a circumstance that none but a 
chemist would have directed. But for fuller and more 
particular directions, in relation to preparing this tinc- 
ture in the most exquisite manner, see Boerhaave's New 
Method of Chemistry, p. 161. Process 53.
^]
[^54. 
* It shews the knowledge of the compilers to order 
the digestion of the myrrh to be so long continued, before 
the addition of the aloes; which if put in together with 
the myrrh, as other dispensatories order it, would make 
only a tincture of aloes; or so clog and saturate the 
menstruum, as not to suffer it to touch the hard gluti- 
nous body of the myrrh; which might therefore almost 
as well have been left out. 
^]
[^55. 
* These liquid Laudanums want considerably of the 
strength of those order'd by the London College, who 
assign two ounces of opium to sixteen ounces of the men- 
struum; the one half of the Tincture Salis Tartari in 
the Laudanum liquidum Tartarizatum, being exhaled 
away in the making: The reason of this difference 
seems to lie here, that the one design'd their Lauda- 
nums as tinctures for filtration; to make them certain 
and safe medicines; and the other theirs as Elixirs, to 
be strain'd or even exhaled for use. 
^]
[^56. 
† This appears to be an admirable medicine for the 
purpose express'd by its title; and is, tho' simple, com- 
pos'd with much art and judgment. 
^]
[^57. 
* The manner of preparation is here directed in con- 
formity with the rules of art; whereas those dispensa- 
tory-writers, who are ignorant of chemistry, and genuine 
pharmacy, order the myrrh, as well as the ingredients, 
without any previous preparation, to be thrown indis- 
criminately into the menstruum. But for the reasons 
of this procedure, with the history of the preparation, 
and the manner of obtaining it in its utmost perfection, 
we must again refer to Boerhaave's New Method of Chemi-
stry, under the curious history of Elixirs, p. 166, 172. 
Pract.
^]
[^58. 
† The conduct of this process is also admirable; and 
could never have been enter'd into by any but thorough 
chemists, who alone can give the reasons thereof; for 
which we therefore refer to Boerhaave, ubi supra. 
^]
[^59. 
* This is a mighty mild, and innocent, yet cordial 
Tincture of Rhubarb; and may with the utmost safety 
be given to young children, without any danger of in- 
flaming their tender viscera, or raising a fever, by the 
burning spirit with which a tincture of rhubarb is com- 
monly extracted: then the addition of the salt of Worm- 
wood seems wonderfully to conspire with the composi- 
tion, and fit it for their use, who constantly abound 
with acidities. 
^]
[^60. 
† This compound Tincture of Rhubarb is also fine- 
ly contriv'd, as a safe stomachic purgative; a little where- 
of, taken now and then, hath surprizing effects in nau- 
seas, diarrhœas, weakness, melancholy, and abundance 
of chronical diseases. 
^]
[^61. 
* They ought to be infus'd in a vessel of earth; 
because one of metal might be prey'd upon by the acid, 
and spoil the fine colour of the tincture. 
^]
[^62. 
† The addition of the Cochineal considerably im- 
proves the colour, which is otherwise too much upon 
the tawny; especially as Rhubarb enters the composi- 
tion of the powder. See Pulvis Hieræ Picræ. 
^]
[^63. 
‖ To heighten the colour of this Elixir, there are 
those who add Cochineal, red Saunders, or Salt of Tar- 
tar; and to increase its purgative virtue, Rhubarb, Ja- 
lap, or Scammony; which in some cases is very proper, 
especially when it is design'd to act as a cathartic. 
^]
[^64. 
† This is a grateful cordial, where the taste of An- 
gelica is not displeasing; and may be used, in the way 
of dram, by those of a weak appetite, or bad dige- 
stion, as a kind of Usquebaugh. 
^]
[^65. 
* The vinous menstruum used in this tincture, with 
the addition of the cochineal, renders it much safer and 
more effectual than that prepared only of the root and 
rectified spirit, or tincture of salt of Tartar, in fe- 
vers, and other distempers, where a high sudorific cor- 
dial is required. 
^]
[^66. 
* It appears by this prescription, that the compilers 
know the stomachic and invigorating, as well as the fe- 
brifuge virtue of the Cortex Peruvianus; tho' as it here 
stands combined with other suitable ingredients, it may 
be very advantageously employ'd for stubborn intermit- 
tents, in cold phlegmatic or cachectic constitutions. 
^]
[^67. 
† Some perhaps may think it unnecessary, that the 
compilers of this Dispensatory should order both a Sto- 
|P_94
machic Tincture, and a Stomachic Elixir; but the for- 
mer, as the title, as well as the ingredients, shows, it 
was design'd to promote digestion, strengthen the sto- 
mach in cachectic habits, and help a weak appetite; 
whilst the Elixir, on the footing of Stoughton's, is cal- 
culated for a grateful, and wholesome bitter, to be used 
occasionally, in order to provoke an appetite, or keep the 
body in a healthy state. 
^]
[^68. 
* See Hepar Sulphuris. 
^]
[^69. 
† This is a very good preparation of Sulphur; and 
preferable to the Balsams usually made thereof; as be- 
ing much more grateful and commodious to take. In 
the preparation, after the liver of Sulphur is reduced to 
powder, in a warm mortar, it shou'd immediately be put 
to the Spirit of Wine; to prevent its attracting the mois- 
ture of the air. 
^]
[^70. 
‖ This Tincture of Tolu is a very pretty pectoral; 
and may be used as such in lozenges; or by dropping it 
upon sugar or otherwise; but in the present Dispensato- 
ry 'tis employ'd, artificially enough, to make the Syru-
pus Balsamicus. 
^]
[^71. 
* The ingredients here are well chose, and proper 
for the intention; the addition of the Gentian, and Ca- 
momile-flowers, renders the medicine much more sto- 
machic: and all their virtues are well order'd to be first 
taken out by the spirit of wine, before the spirit of vitriol, 
which wou'd otherwise scorch and burn them up, is ad- 
ded: a circumstance little regarded by others; tho' 
certainly of great importance. 
^]
[^72. 
† This medicine is commonly known by the name 
of Vinum Benedictum; and frequently used Glyster- 
|P_96
wise, tho' seldom as an emetic, because of its violence. 
Fresh wine may be put upon the fæces, and after stand- 
ing some time, be poured off richly impregnated with 
the virtues of the crocus; but it is a great mistake to 
suppose the sediment will have this faculty for ever; 
because it is certainly found, by the balance, to lose 
something, tho' little, every time. 
^]
[^73. 
* This is a commodious way of obtaining the virtues 
of the millepedes; and thus they may be exhibited to 
great advantage. 
^]
[^74. 
* 'Tis very observable, that all vegetables lose their 
specific virtues by long keeping; so that a poisonous 
plant shall with age become innocent; and a wholesome 
or highly medicinal herb of no manner of efficacy: so 
much does the air, or its ingredients, operate thereon. 
^]
[^75. 
† This is designed to rarify the internal air, for fear of 
breaking the vessels; as it might do, in case it were 
left in full force to expand with the heat. 
^]
[^76. 
* 'Tis judged very improper to filtre any Tinctures of 
resinous or gummy vegetable substances; such as Jalap, 
Scammony, Benjamin, Myrrh, &c. because their 
parts will inevitably stick in the pores of the paper; so 
that all such tinctures should only pass a thin strainer 
at most; or after due time allowed for them to subside, 
be decanted from their fæces. Some, in the number of 
Tinctures to be thus treated, will also doubtless include 
the liquid Laudanums; which above are expresly order-
ed for filtration; and that upon very good grounds: for as 
they wou'd otherwise be continually depositing their se-
diment, or opium, especially if over-charged therewith, 
it were very imprudent to risk the shaking of the con-
taining glass, when the Laudanum comes to be poured 
out for use; and impossible to say what proportion of 
opium was contain'd in a precise quantity of the Tinc-
ture: whence much more than the destin'd dose of o-
pium might dangerously come to be exhibited: but 
such unlucky accidents are by filtration effectually 
prevented. 
^]
[^77. 
* This is a well-contriv'd Decoction, to be used as com- 
mon drink, or instead of the foregoing, in case of a violent 
diarrhœa, or hæmorrhage. 
^]
[^78. 
* This is doubtless an excellent astringent medicine, 
and well contrived in the form of a decoction; which 
admirably fits it for the end proposed, whether by way 
of draught or glyster. 
^]
[^79. 
† A decoction so well adapted cannot but be of great 
service in the cure of the Jaundice, when used freely 
by the patient as ordinary drink. 
^]
[^80. 
* In case of the Stone or Gravel, this doubtless is an 
excellent emollient and diuretic liquor, to be drank 
freely, if it finds a passage by urine. 
^]
[^81. 
† The design of this Decoctum Nitrosum seems to 
be for a liquor to be drank in fevers, and other in- 
flammatory cases; for which it is very well calculated.
