[}A Water against Consumptions. }]
Take Leaves of Comfrey the Greater, 
Solomon's Seal, Plantane, and Pimpinel, each 
4 Hands full, Liquorice-Root 2 Ounces; in-
fuse them cold for 12 Days in 2 Gallons of 
Lime-water. 

This is very easily made, and is much 
better than if it were to be distilled. It is 
of excellent Use in such Consumptions as 
proceed from a sharp thin Blood; especially 
in those who have been injured by a Vene-
real Taint, or have any Hereditary Re-
mains of scrophulous or leprous Humours. 
It is ordered to be drank for some time to-
gether, the Quantity of a Quart or two in 
a Day. It is also directed to wash foul Ul-
cers, and does good Service in such Cases.

Bark 1 Ounce, Liquorice-Root 3 Ounces, 
Coriander-Seeds bruised 6 Drams; infuse 
them cold in one Gallon of Lime-water for 
2 or 3 Days. 

This is yet more drying than the former, 
and is therefore good in all Cases that re-
quire Absorbents and Sweetners; especially 
in all Venereal Affections, after Salivation. 
It will assist much likewise in the Itch, and 
all Foulnesses which lodge upon the Skin. 
It may be drank at Discretion, and ought to 
be used for some time together.

6 Gallons, Earth-worms washed and bruised 
3 Gallons, of common Wormwood, Ground-
Ivy, and Carduus, each one Pound and half, 
Penniroyal, Juniper-Berries, Fennel-seeds, 
Aniseeds, each half a Pound, Cloves and 
Cubebs bruised, each 3 Ounces, Spirit of 
Wine, and Spring-water, of each 8 Gallons; 
digest them together for the Space of 24 
Hours, and then draw it off in a common 
Alembick. 

|P_9
This is admirably well contrived both for 
Cheapness and Efficacy; and for Persons 
whose Circumstances and Manner of living 
have not habituated them to any Delicacies, 
it is as good a Snail-water as can be made; 
and with the two former, are the chief that 
are used in the Hospitals. And as they are 
mostly given in Consumptions contracted 
from vicious Practices, and Venereal Conta-
gions, this is the constant Drink of those 
who are under the like Weaknesses and De-
cays from a malum stamen, and require prin-
cipally Nourishment from such Substances, 
as will, with the least Trouble possible, be 
assimulated for that purpose.

[}D. M—'s Water for the Evil. }]
Take sharp-pointed Dock-Roots half a 
Pound, Monks Rhubarb 4 Ounces, Agaric 
|P_10
2 Ounces, Liquorice, Sweet-Fennel, and 
Coriander-seeds, each half an Ounce; boil 
in a sufficient Quantity of Spring Water, 
and to the strained Liquor add 2 Ounces of 
Diaphoretic Antimony. 

This is much used in schrophulous Cases, 
as a Diet-Drink, and has been found of good 
Service; but at the first, sometimes, the 
Diaphoretic Antimony being unwashed, it 
proves Emetick, tho' without any Inconve-
niency upon that account; the Points of 
the Medicine being left gross enough to 
velicate and draw the Stomach into such 
Contractions. This also avails considerably 
in Venereal and Leprous Impurities. Its 
Operation is principally expected from its 
encreasing of natural Perspiration, and gen-
tly scouring all the secretory Passages.

[}Treacle Water. }]
Take of the Juice of green Walnuts 12 
Pound, of Rue 9 Pound, of Carduus, Ma-
rigolds, and Balm, each 6 Pound, of Butter-
Bur-Root fresh gathered, 4 Pound and half, 
Bur-dock 3 Pound, Angelico and Master-
wort each one Pound and half, of Scordium 
12 Hands-full, London-Treacle one Pound 
and half, Philon. Persic. one Pound, Spirit 
of Wine 30 Pints and 6 Ounces; mix and 
distill according to Art. 

This is a very good Water, and warmer 
than the College Treacle-water. It is given 
as a Cordial in any Fainting or Gripes, espe-
cially in those which frequently happen in 
raising a Salivation. 

In the Lock they generally salivate by 
Unction, and it has been observed, that the 
Lues, and many Cases which would not give 
way to a Salivation raised by inward means, 
have been overcome by this; tho' many are 
of Opinion, that the external Method is 
most dangerous.

[}Dr. M—'s Powder of Steel. }]
Take of the finest Steel 3 Ounces, red 
Sugar-candy 2 Ounces; let them be redu-
ced together into a fine Powder. 

This is a very plain, easy, and most na-
tural Preparation of Steel, and is render'd 
fit thereby to be taken either in Substance, 
or to communicate its Virtues to any Liquor 
by Infusion. It comes nearest to the com-
mon Preparation of Steel with Tartar; and 
has the same Qualities of a Deobstruent. 
Its usual Dose is from ℈i, to ʒss, in a Chlo-
rosis, and all menstrual Obstructions. It is 
likewise a good Medicine in all Hypochon-
driacal Affections; but as the Cure of such 
Patients consists generally more in their way 
of living, than in Medicine, an Hospital 
cares not for the Admission of such Inva-
lids.

[}Lucatellus's Balsam. }]
Take of fine Oyl of Olives and Venice-
Turpentine each 4 Pound, yellow Wax cut 
thin 2 Pound and half; melt them together, 
and add Dragons-blood in fine Powder 2 
Ounces, and mix it into a red Balsam. 

This is much better than that of the Col-
lege Dispensatory, tho' much cheaper and 
easier made. The Dragons-blood gives a 
much better Colour than the Saunders, 
which is in the other; and if either have 
any Virtues suitable to the whole, this bids 
the fairest; and will also much better mix 
therewith, because it in a manner dissolves 
in the Oyl. It is used both inwardly, 
in all Suspicions of internal Ulcerations, 
and externally as a Digestive. 

Balsam. Sulphur. Terebinth. is much used 
in St. Thomas's Hospital, as it is directed to 
be made in Bate's Dispensatory, both inter-
|P_14
nally, and in Dressings for the same purpose, 
as it is directed by the common Practice.

℞ Ol. Lin. ℔iv.

[}The Green Balsam. }]
Take Linseed Oyl 4 Pound, of the finest 
Verdigrease powder'd 1 Pound; boil them 
together till the Verdigrease is dissolved, 
and it will incorporate together into a green 
Balsam. 

This is of great use in all contused and 
lacerated Wounds, and likewise in Gun-
shot Wounds, there is nothing that ex-
ceeds it. 

[}Bolus Alexiter. }]
℞ Theriac. Androm. 
Pulv. Alexit. ā ℈j.

|P_15
[}An Alexiterial Bole. }]
Take Venice-Treacle, and of the Alexi-
terial Powder, each one Scruple, Syrup of 
Cloves a sufficient Quantity to make into a 
Bole. 

This is frequently directed to be taken, 
in order to compose and breath a Person 
after Amputation, or any other Operation 
which is attended with extreme Pain, and 
threatens a Fever; and is repeated as often 
as occasion requires: drinking after it pro-
per Juleps. 

[}Bolus cum Calomel. }]
℞ Calomel. opt. levigat. 
Cons. Ros. rub. ā ℈j.
Misc. f. Bolus. 

[}A Bole with Calomel. }]
Take Calomel well levigated one Scruple, 
Conserve of Roses half a Scuple; mix into 
a Bole. 

This is the common Bole for Salivation, 
and is repeated as the Symptoms require. It 
is also given frequently over Night, to be 
carry'd off by the common Catharticks the 
|P_16
next Morning, in any Cases that require 
brisk Purging. 

[}Bolus Emeticus. }]
℞ Antimonii resuscitat. Batean. Gr. vij.
Cons. Ros. rub. q. s. f. Bol. 
[}An Emetick Bole. }]
Take of revived Antimony, according to 
Bate, 7 Grains, Conserve of red Roses a 
sufficient Quantity to make it into a Bole. 

In very gross and robust Constitutions 
this is given preparatory to any Course of 
Alteratives; for sometimes it will work 
with great Violence, insomuch as to render 
it unsafe to infirm and weakly Persons. 

[}Bolus Emeticus Mercurialis. }]
℞ Turpeth. Min. opt. levig. Gr. vij.
Cons. Ros. rub. q. s. f. Bol. 
[}An Emetick Mercurial Bole. }]
Take of Turbith Mineral well levigated, 
7 Grains, Conserve of red Roses a sufficient 
Quantity to make into a Bole. 

|P_17
This is as rough as the former, but is ge-
nerally made choice of in Venereal and Le-
prous Cases, preparatory to Salivation; and 
is likewise sometimes directed where no such 
Course is intended, particularly in foul Ul-
cers of long standing; the cleansing and 
lasting Cure of which its Operation does 
much forward: But this is too churlish to 
be given but to athletick Constitutions. 

[}Bolus Hydropicus. }]
℞ Gambog. pulv. Gr. xv.

[}An Hydropick Bole. }]
Take Gamboge 15 Grains, Cream of Tar-
tar half a Scruple, Syrup of Buckthorn a 
sufficient Quantity to make them into a 
Bole. 

In a Dropsie, or a flaccid moist Habit 
tending thereunto, this is a very common 
Purge, and a very good one. The Gamboge 
it self is indeed very rough, and works 
sometimes with great Nauseousness, Vomit-
ing and Griping; but the Tartar much cor-
rects it, by dividing its viscid Parts, and 
making them less sensibly velicate the Coats 
of the Stomach and Bowels, as all resinous 
|P_18
Purges are apt to do. It has sometimes also 
mixed with it a Drop or two of Oyl of 
Aniseed, or any other of the carminitive 
Oyls, to render it less griping. This tho-
roughly purges off watry and viscous Hu-
mours, and greatly promotes the Discharge 
by Urine. But to render the Cure of a 
Dropsie lasting, there is a Necessity after-
wards of restoring and strengthning the Tone 
of the Parts by proper Medicines for such 
purposes; else they will soon fill again with 
as much Water as this has carry'd away.

[}A Purging Mercurial Bole. }]
Take of Lenitive Electuary half a Pound, 
Jallap Root powdered one Ounce and half, 
Scammony 6 Drams, Calomel half an Ounce, 
the solutive Syrup of Roses a sufficient Quan-
tity to make them into the Consistence of a 
Bole. The Dose is 3 Drams in a Morning. 

|P_19
This is a sure Purge, and will not fail 
working in the strongest Constitutions. It 
is advisable in all Cases whatsoever, as want 
such Evacuation. It must be made pretty 
stiff, else the Calomel will be apt to fall by 
its great weight, whereby it will be une-
qually mixed; and in hot Weather also it 
will be apt to fret and spoil, if made up too 
thin.

℞ Rhabarb. opt. pulv. ʒss.

[}A Bole against a Looseness. }]
Take Powder of the finest Rhubarb half 
a Dram, Diascordium without Honey, a 
sufficient Quantity to make it into a 
Bole. 

This is to be given in any Fluxes of the 
Belly that require to be stopped, as often as 
the Urgency of the Symptoms indicate; but 
it is generally directed only at Night going 
to Bed; for the Opiate confines the Rhu-
barb from immediate Operation, and what 
Effect that has, is only just to cleanse off so 
much Choler, or irritating Humours, as it 
finds already separated by the Intestinal 
Glands; and it then so astringes them, as to 
|P_20
prevent any further Flux of that kind upon 
them. This Bolus is also frequently given 
to compose and resettle the Bowels, after 
the Operation of such strong Catharticks, as 
cannot well be born without such a Resto-
rative.

Ounces and 1 Dram, Syrup of Buckthorn a 
sufficient Quantity to make them into the 
Consistence of a Bole; to which add Oyl of 
Aniseeds 1 Dram and half. The Dose is 
2 Drams. 

This is stronger than the foregoing with 
the Jallap; and is directed accordingly where 
the most powerful Catharticks are required, 
and can be born without Inconveniency.

[}Dr. M—'s Diuretick Bole. }]
Take Squills 1 Ounce, Powder of Eli-
campane half an Ounce, Oyl of Aniseed half 
a Dram. The Dose is one Dram twice in a 
Day. 

In Asthmatick and Dropsical Habits, this 
is an admirable Medicine; for it greatly 
scours away those Viscidities which stuff the 
Vessels, and hinder due Circulation, and 
detaches them off by the Kidnies. But its 
Use is to be comply'd with for some time to-
gether; and if so continued, the most obsti-
nate Obstructions of the small Vessels, that 
cause both Dropsies and Asthma's, will give 
way to its Efficacy.

London Treacle, Mithridate, and Pigeons-
Dung, each 1 Ounce, Oyl of Scorpions a 
sufficient Quantity to make into a Poultus. 

The Cases this is intended for, happen 
not frequently in the Hospitals: But when 
any Humours are critically discharged in 
malignant Fevers, which are sometimes at-
tended with very surprizing Symptoms, this 
is a good Medicine both to help on their 
Discharge, and defend the Part against 
Mortifications and Gangrenes, which fre-
quently happen in such Cases. In confirm'd 
|P_23
Dropsies likewise, where the lower Parts 
have received more Water than can be car-
ried off by the common Evacuations, and 
the Legs are forced to be scarify'd, this is 
of good Service both to prevent Mortifica-
tion, and forward the Drain of such Hu-
mours; insomuch that the Tone of a Part is 
sometimes retrieved by this means, which 
would otherwise from a partial Mortifica-
tion, induce a total one.

Take Mustard-seed powder'd half a Pound,

mix together in a fine Powder, and keep 
in a Glass close stopped, and just at the time 
of using, make into a Poultus, with a suffi-
cient Quantity of Oxymel of Squils. 

This is a very warm Application, and will 
therefore sometimes help to break away 
those Humours which fix upon the Joints, 
|P_24
occasioning there intolerable Pains, and 
which will not give way to any other means. 
It is to be applyed as often as the Symptoms 
and Urgency of Pain require, and the Part 
can bear; for it is so hot as frequently to 
vesicate the Skin; but it then generally has 
the best Effect, the Pain most commonly 
abating upon drawing out by Perspiration 
such Humours as will raise a Dew upon the 
Skin, and sometimes lift it up into little 
Blisters; but in such Cases all the Harm is 
the Trouble.

Pound and half; put them all together into 
a Bag, to be steep'd in 12 Gallons of un-
hopp'd Ale, while it works; half a Pint to 
be drank 2 or 3 times in a Day. 

This is of good use to absorb and dry up 
the remaining Moistures and watry Humours, 
which the ordinary Catharticks leave be-
hind; and will make the Cure lasting, which 
otherwise would be but short. In all scorbu-
tick Habits likewise, especially where the 
|P_26
Extreams tend towards too great a Fulness 
and Corpulency, this is of real Service, if 
the Patients are kept to it for some time to-
gether. In all Tendencies likewise towards 
a Palsy it does much good both by drying 
away watery and sloughy Humours, which 
destroy due Sensation, and giving Warmth 
and Briskness to the Juices.

[}The Scorbutick Decoction. }]
Take of Common and Roman Worm-
wood each 1 Handful, Agrimony, Carduus, 
and the Tops of Centaury the lesser, of each 
2 Handsful, of Gentian Root sliced 1 Ounce, 
Horse-radish 2 Ounces; boil them in a suf-
ficient Quantity of Spring-water to 6 Pints, 
and in the strained Liquor infuse 1 Handful 
of Chamomel-flowers for use. 

This is one of the Ingredients of the De-
coctum Hydropicum above; and comes into 
|P_31
use after the Load of Humours has been 
forced off by Purges, and the more power-
ful Diureticks; because it confirms the 
Tone of the Fibres, and prevents a Relapse. 
It also gives such Strength to the Stomach, 
as to procure a good Appetite, and help 
Digestion; whereby so many crude Hu-
mours are not supply'd to the Blood, as fill 
the small Glands, and produce the most re-
markable Symptoms of the Scurvy.

But great Care is necessary, that it be not 
given till the Fit is clear off, otherwise it 
will grievously aggravate the Distemper. It 
is to be given seldomer or oftner, according

This gently opens by Stool; but is very 
forcing by Urine, and is therefore directed 
in all Obstructions and Foulnesses of the Kid-

This will purge pretty briskly, and is also 
frequently directed in a Gonorrhœa, to be 
taken till the Matter becomes well-colour'd; 
when it is left off for Things more strength-

Take of the above simple Discutient Pla-

incorporated, with a sufficient Quantity of 
Turpentine. 

Those are both good to discuss hard Tu-
mours; but the latter with Quicksilver is 
much the most efficacious in those which 
are obstinate, and frequently arise from ve-
nereal and scrophulous Causes. Great Care 
|P_48
in making is to be used, to incorporate the 
Quicksilver well with Turpentine, else it 
will not be so mixed, but that in spreading 
the Plaster for use, it will separate and run 
into Globules. If this be carefully made, it 
is preferable to the Frog-Plaster with Quick-
silver in the London Dispensatory, altho' that 
is vastly more troublesome to make, being 
stuffed with many Ingredients, that are of no 
real Service, but only to perplex the Com-
pounder, and amuse the Expectations of the 
Ignorant.

Take of the simple discutient Plaster 
above-mentioned, or of the sticking Plaster 
in Bate's, a sufficient Quantity to spread 
thick upon Leather, over which sprinkle of 
the fine Powder of Cantharides as much as 
will stick. 

This is an easy way, and now much used 
in the common Practice, as well as in the 
Hospitals. And it is much more certain, 
|P_49
than the common Plasters into which the 
Flies are mixed, for it cannot fail of its In-
tention; but some are apprehensive that by 
this means the Flies get more into the Blood, 
and are more liable to create Stranguries, 
and such Inconveniencies as make their in-
ward Use so dangerous. But whether there 
be any thing in this or not, there is not 
Room here to consider. However, those 
who chuse this way are obliged to leave the 
Edges of the Plaster uncovered with the Flies, 
or to stick Strops on it cross-ways, spread 
with somewhat sticking, else it will not keep 
upon the Part to which it is applyed.

This is spread upon Leather pretty thick, 
and apply'd to the Small of the Back, to be

continued as long as it will stick, for many 
Weaknesses of the Kidneys; in which case 
it frequently does good Service: But it is 
more particularly useful in that Disorder 
which, amongst the Females, is called the 
Whites. But to some it occasions such into-

keep it on.

This is a very strong Emetick, and is 
much used at Bedlam, amongst the Maniacks, 
for it will operate, when neither the Crocus,
nor any of the common Mercurial Emeticks, 
will move them. And it has been confirmed 
by all Experience, that such Patients are 
much more difficult to be wrought upon, 
than any others, either by Catharticks or 
Emeticks; insomuch that they will bear 
enough at a Dose for 6 or 10 ordinary Per-
sons: their Fibres, and all the Parts of the 
Brain, most particularly administring to Sen-
|P_55
sation, being extremely clogged with viscid 
Humours, which this Medicine is very pow-
erful in draining off; and upon the same 
Account likewise it is of such good Service 
as a Sternutatory; for it greatly drains the

natural Mucus, and lay open the Capillaries 
in such manner as to let out the Blood to 
flow at every Stool.

[}Dr. W—'s Infusion of Millepedes. }]
Take 4 Pound of live Millepedes, infuse 
them cold in 8 Pints of White Wine for 14 
Days; then strain for Use. 

This is an excellent Diuretick, and a most 
efficacious Medicine in all Chronick Cases, 
that are to be relieved by promoting the 
urinary Discharges, as are many schrophu-
lous Disorders, and such as frequently are 
the Forerunners of scorbutick Dropsies, from 
a Retention of such Humours as foul the 
Viscera, and stuff the whole Habit with 
Water and Viscidities.

[}Dr. M—'s Paralytick Infusion. }]
Take Horse-radish Root sliced thin, and 
Mustard-seed bruised, each 4 Ounces; in-
fuse them in 4 Pints of boiling Water for 
24 Hours; then strain for use, and drink 
half a Pint twice in a Day. 

This is not only Diuretick as the former, 
but is also much warmer; and is therefore 
not only directed to cleanse away by Urine 
any thing that lodges upon the Fibres, so 
as to spoil their Offices, but also to give 
them due Warmth, which in Paralytick Ca-
ses they are destitute of. It ought to be kept 
close stopped, because it otherwise would, 
by its Volatility, spoil and grow vapid. In 
Rheumatisms, this is also frequently given, 
with great Success; especially if the Limbs 
swell with great Pains.

[}The Pleuretick Infusion. }]
Take fresh Horse-dung 6 Ounces, Peni-
royal-water 12 Ounces, Treacle-water 4 
Ounces; infuse them warm, and to the 
strained Liquor add Mithridate 2 Drams, 
White Sugar a sufficient Quantity to sweeten 
it; drink half a Pint twice in a Day. 

This is a very good Medicine for the pur-
pose it is intended for, and will frequently 
procure Ease, when no other means will take 
place. If the Dose here mentioned be too 
noisome, it may be lessened, and repeated 
the oftener. This is likewise order'd in 
Distempers of the Breast, that are not a true 
Pleurifie, wherein it will do great Service, as 
in a Peripneumony; and in an Asthma, the 
common pectoral Drinks are not to be com-
pared to it.

Take Camphor 2 Drams, set it on fire, 
and quench it in a Pint of Water; then light 
|P_59
it again and quench it, which repeat till all 
the Camphor is consumed. 

This is order'd in malignant Fevers, and 
in inflammatory Cases. There are some pe-
culiar Hysterical Cases, wherein also it is of 
good Service: but it is not greatly used.

each 8 Ounces, Bryony-water compound 4 
Ounces, Troches of Myrrh powder'd 2 
Drams, fine Sugar 1 Ounce and half; mix 
into a Julep. 

This is the ordinary Hysterick Julep, gi-
ven either as a Diluter of other more effica-
cious Medicines in such Cases, or where 
the Symptoms are not much aggravated, 
being well shaked before taking; the Quan-
tity of 5 or 6 Spoonfuls at a Dose, to be re-
peated once in 3 or 4 Hours.

Take compound Scordium-water 8 Oun-

2 Ounces, Syrup of Cloves a sufficient Quan-
tity to sweeten it. 

This is prescribed in all kinds of Fevers, 
and is much more efficacious than the Juleps 
ordinarily prescribed in common Practice: 3 
or 4 Spoonfuls may be repeated every 2 or 3 
Hours, till some Crisis appears, and the 
Distemper abates.

This is commonly directed in all Distem-

is given a Spoonful at Discretion.

horn an Ounce and half, Chymical Oyl of 
Aniseed, of Cloves, and of Nutmegs, each 
2 Drams, and make into a Mass for use; 
The Dose from 1 Grain to 2 Grains. 

These are both extraordinary Medicines, 
easily made, and much preferable to any 
under the same Title, that are vastly more 
troublesome and costly to prepare. Their 
Use needs no Explanation.

[}The Astmatick Mixture. }]
Take Oxymel of Squills, Barley and Cin-

together. 

This is given to promote Expectoration; 
and it is also an excellent Diuretick, by 
which means it operates all possible ways to 
answer the purposes signified by the Title. 
It is given a Spoonful at a time, 3 or 4 times 
in a Day, but particularly in the Morning.

If this is not mixed in a very large Vessel, 
and great Care taken, the Fermentation 
will be so violent and sudden, as to throw 
it over. It is very good for the purposes its 
Title expresses, and is directed 3 or 4 
Spoonfuls at a time, to be repeated after 
every Vomiting, till it stops.

This is a standing Mixture at the Lock

ping, and a Tenesmus, which frequently 
happen by anointing with Mercurials to 
raise Salivation. And if Blood likewise ap-
pears with the Stools, the following Clyster

Take of the best Opium 4 Ounces, dis-
solve it and boil it in a sufficient Quantity 
of clear Water, till it gives it a very red 
Colour, which strain from the Fæces; to 
them put fresh Water, and boil again; 
which repeat as long as they will continue 
to give any Tincture; then evaporate the 
several Tinctures together into the Consi-
stence of a Pill. 

This is used in the same Cases and Quan-
tities as crude Opium, and by some is pre-
ferr'd thereunto; but the Difference is not 
worth disputing, and hardly worth the 
Trouble of the latter Process.

24 Hours, then boil to 10 Pints; strain, and 
add Honey 6 Pounds; then boil and clarify; 
to which add of the Extract of Liquorice 
half a Pound, and make into a Syrup. 

This is an efficacious Detergent, and does 
greatly promote Expectoration; for which 
purpose it is much given in all Asthmatick 
Cases, and where the Breast is clogged with 
viscid Humours: 2 or 3 Spoonfuls are orde-
red to be taken at any time.

This is a pleasant and a very safe Opiate, 
and may be given in all Cases where such 
Helps are required. But its principal Use 
is in Catarrhs, and such Defluxions, as occa-
sion tickling Coughs, which it greatly re-

deal of Serum by the cutaneous Glands in 
Perspiration, and Breathing-Sweats.

As the former is given to stop the Deflu-
xion of Rheum upon the Glands of the 
Throat, and encourage its Discharge by the 
Skin; these are intended to divert it by 
Stool, and are very good for that purpose. 
They are given to asthmatick Constitutions,

do to the Lungs.

These are very efficacious in all Obstructi-
ons of the Urinary Passages; and also so 
very detergent, as to be of great Service in 
any Foulnesses of the Viscera; so that they 
are not only of good Service in the Stone 
and Gravel, but in the Jaundice and Astth-
ma's, in the most obstinate Cases of which 
they are order'd with the greatest Certainty 
of Success. They are to be taken from 3

using proper Diluters at the same time.

These are directed in gross Habits of Bo-
dy, that are contracted either from a sloth-
ful Life, or a poor gross Diet, where the 
Stomach and Viscera begin to be stuffed with 
such Viscidities, as create Dropsies, Asth-, 
|P_73

These are directed to be taken every 
Morning, 6 or 7 at a Dose; they gently 
purge, and both cleanse away sloughy Hu-
mours, which foul the Coats of the Sto-
mach, and warm the Fibres, whereby Di-

These are given in ordinary Coughs in

These are powerfully purging, and are 
generally given in Venereal Cases, previous 
to a Salivation, or a Course of Alteratives. 
If they are made from each Dram into 10

These purge much, and carry off a great 
Quantity of watery Humours, where-ever 
they are ordered, particularly for Dropsies,

These are strongly purgative, and calcu-
lated particularly to scour the Genital Parts, 
and those Passages as are principally infected 
by Venereal Taints; insomuch that they 
will frequently cleanse away a Gonorrhœa,
without the Assistance of Mercury; tho' 
most commonly, a Bole with that is given 
over Night.
