[}SYNOPSIS
OF 
THE CAUSES
OF 
CHRONIC DISEASES.}]
ALL arts, whether plastic, mathematical, 
mechanical, or physical, are but the hand-
maids and imitators of Nature. Most success-
ful is the practitioner who can happily trace her 
path, and can copy nearest to the divine origi-
nal: Who, knowing her ways, is able to lend 
a hand when she is obstructed; or can render 
her propitious by gentle and well timed invita-
tions. In the healing art particularly, it was
 observed two thousand years ago by Hippocrates,
the great father of medical science[/1./], that, Na-
tureis the sovereign curer of diseases, and that 
physicians are, or ought to be, her humble imita-
tors[/2./]and servants[/3./]. By unceasing attendance 
on the sick, invincible patience, and the most 
vigilant observation of every action and motion 
of NATURE, that illustrious Archiater acquired 
a wonderful knowledge of the genuine nature 
of diseases,—of the ###Greek omitted###, and of the gra-
dual, 
|P_6
uniform, consentient operations[/4./] of that 
exquisite mechanism, and innate, energetic 
principle of self preservation, with which the 
CREATOR of man hath been pleased to en-
dow our bodies: And, by carefully comparing 
the same sort of distempers, and their various 
minute motions, in different patients, and all 
the circumstances [###Greek omitted###] and 
accidents [###Greek omitted###] which usually preceded and at-
tended them, he could readily foretel an ap-
proaching disease, and after its invasion, give a 
right judgment of the progress and event of it. 

This surprizing skill of his, in foretelling the 
approach, successive changes, and event, of dis-
cases, and that of other succeeding physicians 
who carefully studied and pursued his method, 
procured them a kind of religious veneration 
among the people, who were wont to look upon 
them as prophets inspired by the Gods, and 
even as arbiters of life and death. 

But as this old method of acquiring the ###Greek 
omitted### is extremely tedious, 
crabbed, and severe, it has been little regarded 
for many ages, except by certain particular re-
tainers to the Coan school; such, for instance, 
as Sydenham and his truly ingenious and singu-
larly modest translator Mapletoft[/5./], Bagtivi, 
Boerbaave, Mead, Huxham, &c. 

|P_7
In later times, a much easier and more com-
pendious way to fame and opulence has been 
happily discovered: And we can now, with 
singular propriety, apply to the ancient practice 
of observation, what that lucky son of fortune 
Gnatho (in Terence) told an honest, simple, half-
starved brother of his, on a similar occasion — 
— "Olim isti fuit 
Generi quondam quæstus, apud seclum prius —
— Hoc novum est aucupium."

This Prince of Physicians first observed in what 
manner the symptoms in acute diseases [###Greek omitted###,] 
when not interrupted by art, or by any external 
cause [###Greek omitted###] succeeded one ano-
ther, and by what evacuations,Nature, when 
left to herself, got rid of those diseases[/6./]: And 
on this solid basis of observation, he originally 
erected that noblest production of human ge-
nius and sagacity, (monumentum ære perennius) 
|P_8
the art of presaging; and formed from thence a 
method of curing natural diseases, by means of 
such artificial ones as Nature, when too lan-
guid and remiss herself, never failed to point 
out or reveal to this her faithful minister. He 
had frequently observed, in the practice of his 
divine mistress, that a spontaneous hæmorrhage 
of blood from the nose always mitigated, and 
oftentimes carried off, certain kinds of fevers, 
and other violent disorders. This suggested to 
him the practice of artificial hæmorrhages by 
bleeding, scarification, &c. which he likewise 
used, on certain occasions, prophylactically, or 
by way of prevention: For experience had taught 
this consummate artist, that those means which 
were wont to assuage bad symptoms after they 
appeared, would prevent their coming on, if 
used in proper time. He had likewise observ-
ed, that Nature frequently cured certain dis-
eases by spontaneous abscesses in different parts 
of the body. When he found Naturepre-
vented from working her own way, by such sa-
lutary operations, he substituted in their room 
artificial abscesses, such as issues, setons, &c. 

It became farther obvious to him, that some 
violent disorders were carried off by a sponta-
neous diarrhœa, or vomiting; others by plen-
tiful warm sweats, or a gentle moisture of the 
skin; others again by a critical discharge of 
urine, and some by expectoration, &c. Hence 
|P_9
his practice[/7./], ###Greek omitted###, of exciting artificial
diarrhœas by purging medicines;—vomits; sudo-
rifics; diaphoretics; diuretics; expectorants, &c. 

That a medicine, which, consonant to this 
rational and truely physical doctrine of Hippo-
crates, the prime minister of Nature, would 
constantly operate with equal safety, ease, and 
efficacy, in all, even the most opposite consti-
tutions, and uniformly answer every intention 
of an universal evacuant, by attenuating, dis-
solving, and carrying off, the viscid concretions, 
and foulnesses, of the stomach and intestines; 
thereby cleansing and deterging those concoc-
tive organs, and restoring them to their pristine 
natural action; or, by a milder gradual opera-
tion[/8./], in proper doses, removing obstructions 
in the remoter vessels, and carrying off any 
morbid or excrementitious humours, by insen-
sible perspiration[/9./], sweat, and urine. — That 
|P_10
such a medicine is one important desideratum in 
physic, the learned and judicious professors of 
the faculty, who have sacrificed at the shrine of 
Nature, will readily acknowledge—That the 
subject of this discourse is such a medicine, the 
author dares, with undesigning confidence, as-
sert; after a thousand successful trials made of 
it, by himself, and his medical acquaintances 
in different countries: Under the sanction of 
which impartial experience, he can now safely 
recommend it to the public, as an universal 
purgative,—not as an universal medicine,—nor 
even as a specific one, that, 'by its peculiar ope-
ration on the animal fluids, can transform any 
morbific matter, or preternatural ferment, into 
good blood and humours.'—He knows none 
such: Nor can he, on this occasion, forbear 
expressing a real and honest concern, that the 
###Greek omitted### — by specific remedies, is not yet 
wholly confined to the mountebank professions 
of empirics; to whom promises cost nothing but 
the health and lives of those who trust them. 
That the opinion of the specific operations, or, 
which is the same thing, the occult qualities, 
of medicines, in the cure of diseases, continues 
to be a prevailing principle in physic, the pub-
lications of the current century, and shop re-
cords, mutually evince: Though 'tis evident, 
that, agreeably to this doctrine, and method of 
procedure, it will be impossible ever to fix any 
|P_11
bounds to the materia medica, (and consequent-
ly to the still growing, tho' already insupport-
able expence of physic) or to reduce the praxis 
medica to any rational general principles; whilst 
the whole vegetable, animal, and mineral king-
doms are ransacked and tortured, in order to 
find out those occult qualities and specific ope-
rations. — Hence, such is the felicity of the pre-
sent times, and so wonderfully is the world now 
enriched with specifics, simple and compound, 
(under the conjuring titles of alexipharmics, 
cardiacs, cephalics, neurotics, stomachics, &c. 
antifebrifics, antihysterics, antepileptics, antic-
terics, antiscorbutics, &c.) that there is not a 
family in the kingdom which can spare a few 
shillings, but may purchase a dispensatory,con-
taining several hundreds of those choice appro-
priated remedies, for the cure of all diseases. — 
Nor is it of less utility to the junior part of the 
faculty, or sucking practitioners, [###Greek omitted###,] as 
the learned Doctor Gideon Harvey quaintly titles 
them: Since, by this means, they are accom-
modated with an elegant set of extemperaneous 
prescriptions, and a competent number of those 
most approved specifics, recommended by the 
authority and experience of the greatest names, 
are always kept ready prepared in the shops, 
such as may answer all cases ###Greek omitted###, to 
avoid the needless trouble of making a right 
judgment[/10./] upon any case in particular. 
|P_12

With regard to this specific practice, (the con-
stant political subterfuge of physic-craft) it is 
well known to every judicious experienced phy-
sician, that the artful pretence of curing dis-
eases by the occult qualities of specific remedies, 
is now, as it always has been, the principal 
source of all the knavery, impudence, and ig-
norance, that we meet with in the profession. 

Any semicrude practitioner in this way, who 
is possessed of a tolerable share of cunning and 
address, can never want a specious pretext for 
making a property of his patient, almost as long 
as he pleases, by flattering his hopes from time 
to time; tho' the patient finds himself never 
the better, but perhaps still grows worse: If 
one specific succeed not, another is tried, and, 
if that fails, a third, and so on[/11./]; as long as 
the poor infatuated believing sufferer has any 
money, strength, or patience left. 

Suffice it here to quote one instance, out of 
a multitude that might be produced, of this 
medicina politica; and be that the specifictreat-
ment of those chronical disorders commonly di-
stinguished by the technical epithets of arthri-
tic, rheumatic, scorbutic, hysteric, and hypocon-
driac. Several hundred volumes (without count-
ing those petit essays[/12./] that are daily spewing 
out of the press) have been professedly written[/13./]
on the causes, &c. of these maladies: Though 
|P_13their whole ætiology may be comprised in a 
few words.—Ease, indolence, intemperance, 
indulged pleasure, irregular gratifications of 
the natural appetites, and the want of pure, 
fresh air[/14./], and habitual exercise, are the 
|P_14
genuine original causes of these disorders amongst 
us; and, in short, of all our national constitu-
|P_15
tional complaints—of our growing weaknesses, 
increasing scurvies, multiplying rheumatisms, 
|P_16
universal wandering gouts, and the most obsti-
nate chronic and hereditary diseases fixing and 
radicating themselves still more and more in 
our natural habits and constitutions.—Hence 
it is, that the natural evacuations become ob-
structed and diminished; the secreted humours 
are thickened, and rendered viscous, adhesive, 
and clammy; the solids, especially the nervous 
system, weakened and relaxed; the fluids ne-
cessarily contract ill qualities; and an acrid, sa-
line, corrosive serum is produced: This serum, 
wherever it is thrown, or happens to be depo-
sited, lacerates or erodes and ulcerates the so-
lids, and occasions[/15./] all the symptoms of a true 
and genuine land scurvy. And this name of 
scurvy it commonly receives, and is distinguish-
ed by, as often as it proves effluent[/16./], in pim-
ples, blotches, scaly leprous scurf, scabs, tet-
ters, and other such eruptions on the skin: But 
|P_17
when it happens to prove influent[/17./], and is 
thrown upon the stomach, bowels, lungs, liver, 
spleen, mesentery, kidneys, bladder, womb, 
or any internal part, it sometimes passes under 
the more polite appellation of nervous or spas-
modic complaints; but chiefly under the tech-
nical names of febricula, cholic, cachexy, dy-
sentery, dropsy, asthma, atrophy, jaundice, 
diabetes, dysury, gonorrhæa, fluor albus, or 
white flux: A complaint, this last, the most 
disagreeable of all others to the natural delicacy 
of the sex, and, on account of its increasing 
prevalency, the most alarming in a national 
light; as being the greatest, however generally 
unheeded, enemy to conception, and, in its 
consequences, more fatal to population than 
the sword itself.—From the same serose or scor-
butic cacochymy, in like manner originate[/18./], 
in different constitutions, the cancer; St. An-
thony's fire; gout; sciatica; rheumatism; 
palsy, &c. 

Now, the orthodox medical processes, and 
formulæ, of our specific practitioners, in those, 
commonly denominated, arthritic, scorbutic, 
hysteric, and hypocondriac disorders, consist 
chiefly of hot vegetable aromatics, bitters, and 
astringents, infused in strong wines or spirits; 
the volatile oils and spirits of vegetables and 
|P_18
animals; spirituous solutions of the fœtid and 
oily gums, and vegetable resins; tinctures and 
infusions of castor, contrayerva, cochineal, saf-
fron, snake-root, valerian, and the like; cha-
lybeates, opiates, and various sorts of pharma-
ceutic drams heated and raised still higher with 
the volatile oils, spirits, and salts.—But, if this 
original morbid constitution, as already ob-
served, should consist in the tenacity and visci-
dity of the blood and animal fluids, occasion-
ing a diminution of the secretions, and a con-
sequent distention and relaxation of the nervous 
system; 'tis evident, that the foregoing heating, 
rarifying method, by aggravating all the symp-
toms, must strengthen the morbid habit, and 
confirm the disease still more and more.—And 
thus it is, in fact, that patients under these 
complaints are, by our specificians, kept on 
from year to year, living and dying by turns; 
being strictly interdicted the use of all strong 
malt liquors, wine, and common drams; at the 
same time that they are continually loaded with 
prescriptions of liquid Fire out of the shops. 

But, passing unnoticed, for brevity sake, the 
intermediate acts of this politico-medical drama, 
proceed we directly to the catastrophe. 

When the constitutions of the patients are, 
in this manner, nearly exhausted, and life worn 
out to its bare threads[/19./]; our specific practi-
|P_19
tioners immediately put them under the regula-
tions of diet, riding, change of air, bathing, 
and water-drinking, at Bath, Bristol, Buxton, 
or some other distant mineral spring; where 
they may die decently, with a favourable salvo 
to the doctor's reputation, as having then used 
the last remedies—which, in all medical pro-
priety, ought to have been the first.

Now, it is in chief as a friendly co-operating
 auxiliary to these truely appropriate remedies[/20./], 
(the dernier ressort of our specificians) that the 
author of the Universal Purgative, cordially, 
conscientiously, recommends the occasional use 
of it, to every native of Britain labouring under 
any of the above national chronical maladies. 
Not but that this medicine will always be found, 
when properly administered, a more salutary 
assistant to the same remedies, in the prevention,
than in the cure, of those maladies: Forasmuch 
as Nature is ever in some degree weakened, 
by the invasion of an enemy; even though she 
alone, or judiciously assisted, may have expel-
led him out of her dominions. 

The immediate or first efficient cause (the 
præincipient causes[/21./] have been already given) 
of all our arthritic, rheumatic, scorbutic, hyste-
ric, and hypocondriac complaints; and, in short, of the whole gloomy catalogue of nervous disor-
ders, seems to be an acrid serous humour,pro-
|P_20
duced as above described, and lodged either in 
the glands, minute vessels, or vascular coats, 
or interstices of the vessels, of the stomach; 
occasioning, by its irritation, a preternatural 
laxity and debility of the fibres of the alimen-
tary canal; a vitiated secretion in the glands of 
the stomach, and a consequent depraved state 
of the gastric juices; a læsion (with the natu-
rally consequent spasmodic affections) of the 
nerves of that concoctive organ; an imperfect 
digestion; a generation of wind and phlegm; 
an irregular and less vigorous and uniform mo-
tion of the blood in the vena portæ, and, of 
consequence, an inert, viscid, peccant bile, 
which, in its natural healthy state, is the most 
highly animalized of all the juices, and the most 
conducive towards promoting all the secretions 
and excretions of the human body, particularly 
those of the alimentary tube—The principal seat 
of all nervous, hysteric, and hypocondriac af-
fections. 

That this rationale is just, the really learned 
and indefatigable inquirers into the human pa-
thology will allow; and consequently, that the 
true curative intention will consist wholly, at 
first, in correcting, attenuating, resolving, and 
expelling, this acrid humour, by some of the 
natural evacuations[/22./]. 

|P_21
In this first capital intention, the medicine 
here recommended, properly dosed, and pro-
perly administered (for on this ###Greek omitted### depends 
the success of every appropriate remedy) has 
been found, in a long and extensive experience, 
to produce very salutary effects, even in persons 
of the most opposite natural habits and consti-
tutions. 

Nor will these ascribed effects appear exag-
gerated to the judicious and experienced practi-
tioner, when he is informed, that this medicine 
is composed of near a dozen of the most powerful 
known deobstruents, besides two mineral pre-
parations of the author's own discovery, which 
two alone, united ###Greek omitted###, have been found to 
perform, in fact, what that indefatigable phy-
sician the late Doctor Huxham peculiarly ascribes 
to his favourite Tincture, in the following words
—"It passeth through and scours even the very 
smallest tubuli of the whole human frame, and 
is besides sufficiently powerful to give a strong 
irritation to the great alimentary canal, and 
therefore more surely to affect the small canali-
culi of the body; and yet, from the exceeding 
tenuity of its minute particles, it by no means 
lacerates the vessels." 

In a similar manner[/23./], this medicine operates, 
in properly adapted doses; removing obstruc-
|P_22
tions in the remoter vessels, and promoting 
###Greek omitted### the secretions in general, particularly 
those of urine and perspiration. 

For the universal promptitude, ease, and effi-
cacy[/24./], of its operation, as a purgative, even in 
the most delicate and irritable habits, the author 
has the concurrent testimony of many judicious 
practitioners, some of them physicians of emi-
nence; not only in England, but in Holland, 
Germany, and Switzerland: And, in this in-
tention, the like uniform operation has been 
found to attend its use, in different, and even 
in opposite climates; without any of those in-
jurious colliquative effects[/25./] so generally ascrib-
ed by physicians to the preparations of aloes, 
and particularly to that long popular one ori-
ginally known by the name of Francfurt Pills,
first invented and described by Hartman Beyer;
of which feveral spurious sorts have been since 
vended, in different countries, under various 
names—Pilulæ Angelicæ, Aloes Rosata, Pilulæ 
Tartareæ, Grana Angelica, &c.—At Rome, 
(notwithstanding the observation of that distin-
guished Roman physician Giorgio Baglivi, in his 
Praxis Medica; where, treating of the cure of 
diseases in that city, he says—"No sort of re-
medies afford so much benefit to the inhabitants 
of Rome, as exercise, and a prudent repetition 
|P_23
of gentle purgatives—but purgatives, given in 
the form of pills, have no successful or plenti-
ful operation,") it has been found, by the ex-
perience of several travellers, the author's 
friends, to operate with all desirable efficacy: 
And, on the like authentic evidence, in a much 
greater variety of instances, he can safely war-
rant, in the same intention, effects equally salu-
tary, from its use, in both Indies.

In occasional, or habitual costiveness, it will 
be found an effectual remedy, free from the in-
conveniences ascribed to aloetic, rhabarbarine,
and saline preparations, in that intention; as it 
neither produces sickness nor gripes, and leaves 
no astriction in the bowels. 

But, in no one intention will this medicine 
prove more universally salutary and beneficial, 
than in that of a frequent family purge, on the 
so justly celebrated prophylactic plan of that hap-
py explorer of Nature Lord Verulam—to cleanse 
the stomach and bowels from those viscid, or slimy, 
and vitiated bilious, humours which are so frequent-
ly collected in them, constituting the source and 
fomes of various diseases, as well chronic as acute, 
to which people of every rank are liable; but the 
delicate, the polite, the studious, and the sedentary, 
more particularly so: It being past all doubt with 
the author, that thousands even of valuable 
lives are yearly cut off, by prematurity of death, 
which an exact practical observance of this plan
|P_24
(including, in its full extent, exercise[/26./], with 
alacrity, temperance, and simplicity of diet) might 
have happily conducted, with tranquillized pass-
sions[/27./], to the placid ###Greek omitted### of old age—
when death becomes ultimately a necessity and 
no pain, the blessing and not the evil of Nature. 

Notwithstanding the here recited, and other 
valuable properties of this medicine; the author 
has not the ridiculous presumption to offer it to 
the public as a Specific Remedy in any particular 
disease.—In the above mentioned chronical dis-
orders, he is warranted, by the indisputable 
sanction of experience, to recommend it as an 
efficacious assistant to those peculiarly appro-
priated remedies—An early well masticated crust 
or biscuit; a regulated diet; riding; friction[/28./]; 
|P_25
change of air; seasonable bathing[/29./]; medicinal 
|P_26
|P_27
|P_28water-drinking[/31./]; and summer voyages at 
|P_29
sea[/32./]: By which last alone, under a proper die-
|P_30
tetic regimen, and the occasional use of these 
pills, he has known inveterate chronic diseases 
|P_31
cured, which had baffled all the powers of me-
dicine. 
|P_32

Nor is it irrational to suppose, from the 
known antiscorbutic properties of this composi-
|P_33
tion,that it might prove a salutary prophylac-
tic, or preventive of the marine scurvy, in sea-
|P_34
faringpeople:—The propriety of this sup-
position is, in fact, confirmed by attested suc-
|P_35
cessfulexperiments made of it, by two very 
able sea-surgeons —But, on this head, the au-
thor can say nothing from his own experience—
his sole criterion of the real powers of medicine: 
And by this criterion, he honestly confesses, he 
has found several elaborate preparations of his 
own, (for he too was formerly an indefatigable 
labourer in the curious ###Greek omitted### of medicine, 
searching after a succedaneum to the tree of 
life) as well as the most pompously authenti-
catedsecifics, in chronic diseases, that have been
exhibited to the public, for thirty years past, 
deplorably wanting, and inadequate, not only 
to the particular ends proposed, but to the ge-
nuine ultimate end of physic in general—###Greek 
omitted###; not excepting even those of the 
learned Vienna Austrian school—to which the 
distinguishing palm—the supreme eclat of work-
ing wonders, in regular practice, has, by the 
united suffrage of the faculty in Europe, been 
deservedly given of late years. 
|P_36

By the same criterion, he is convinced of the 
possibility of discovering a remedy, which would 
immediately cure a fever, the most violent and 
dangerous symptom attending certain acute dis-
cases.

The celebrated professor Pitcairn long ago 
published to the world his notion of such a re-
medy, as a grand desideratum in physic: And 
an illustrious successor of his, in the same pro-
fessorial chair, Boerhaave, used often, in his 
public lectures, to speak of the possibility of 
discovering a remedy that might cure most or 
all acute febrile diseases; and actually recom-
mended the trial of medicines composed of an-
timony and mercury, ("ad magnam penetrabili-
tatem arte deductis") for that purpose.—The 
author is in possession of a remedy, without an-
timony, mercury, or any other mineral, in its 
composition, which he believes will immediate-
ly cure a fever, in its incipient state: That it 
has been used, with great success, at Constanti-
nople, and other places in Turky, in carrying off 
the plague itself, when administered on the first 
appearance of the symptoms, he is assured by a 
traveller, of great learning and curiosity, to 
whose friendly communication he owes his 
knowledge of it. 

The prevailing hypothesis, that a fever is 'Na-
ture's instrument to expel an enemy;' or, in 
|P_37
other words, that 'every fever is its own cure,' 
and consequently, that no medicine can be said, 
in strict propriety, to cure a fever, was origi-
nally invented by Asclepiades, (that finished 
master in the ###Greek omitted###) above eighteen 
hundred years ago[/33./]. But this hypothesis, how-
|P_38
ever specious, however recommended, by the sanction of antiquity, and the later authority of 
|P_39
great names, has always appeared to the author 
unsupported by Reason and Facts.—The most 
plausible argument he has met with, in favour 
of this theory, is, that in acute diseases of the 
eruptive kind, and particularly in the small-pox,
'as soon as the morbific matter is expelled to 
the surface of the body, the fever ceases:" 
therefore, 'the fever is an effort of Nature
to relieve herself.' But it is well known to 
every experienced practitioner, that the less the 
|P_40
fever is in the natural small-pox, the fewer will 
be the pustules, and the variolous matter more 
happily expelled; or, according to our great 
Sydenbam, [Angliæ lumen, artis Phæbum] "Quo 
sedatior est sanguis eo melius erumpent pus-
tulæ." 

It has indeed been a received opinion, almost 
ever since the first appearance of the small-
pox[/34./] in Europe, that 'a certain degree of fe-
|P_41
ver is always required, to concoct, separate, 
and expel, the vitiated and infectious matter.' 
But Mr. Sutton (the reputed author of the new 
method of inoculation; though, by the bye, 
the very same method, in every essential point,
was practised by Mr. Glass, an eminent surgeon 
in the university of Oxford, long before Mr. 
Sutton was known) has fully demonstrated, by 
many thousands of successful experiments, that 
the fever in this disease is so far from being 
'Nature's instrument to expel an enemy,' 
that itself is her greatest enemy; and conse-
quently ought to be prevented, or extinguished[/35./]
immediately. And, in his peculiar attention to 
this single point, the author has sufficient reason 
to believe Mr. Sutton's superior success wholly 
consists: For, having had many favourable 
opportunities, during several years, of ascer-
taining, by means of a most accurately-made 
pyranthropometer, the natural heat of the body, 
in Mr. Sutton's patients, when in perfect health, 
immediately before their entering on his prepa-
ratory course, and afterwards during the pro-
gress of the disease; he found, in a variety of 
instances of a compleat and regular small pox, 
|P_42
the bodily heat, when at the highest, from six 
to fourteen degrees below that of perfect health. 

The most distinguished ancient physicians of 
the Hippocratic school, had no other idea of a 
fever than that of their great master—viz. a 
fiery or preternatural heat. This preternatural 
heat they conceived of, as a symptom, the cure 
of which was the province of the physician; 
whilst the removing, and carrying off, the pri-
mary cause of this symptom, that is, the cure of 
the disease, was considered chiefly as the work 
of NATURE. Now, the primary cause of every 
fever is, as the author conceives, some stimulant 
or acrid matter spasmodically affecting the vascular 
and nervous system: Whether this matter be, 1st. A 
foreign substance lodged in the flesh—2dly, A 
putrid fomes absorbed into the habit, from gun-
shot wounds, &c. in removing these two causes, 
Nature may often require the surgeon's helping 
hand—3dly, Deleterious miasmata residing in the 
air—4thly, A putrid fomes of any kind, produ-
cing an acrimonious state of the fluids—5thly, 
Purulent matter lodged in the body, from inter-
nal suppurations—Or, 6thly, external cold, or, 
what is usually called catching of cold. This last 
mentioned, and, perhaps, most frequent cause of 
fevers, has been generally supposed to be the 
materia perspirabilis of Sanctorius[/36./], retained in 
|P_43
the body, or, as it is commonly expressed, ob-
structed perspiration: But a course of staticalex-
|P_44
periments instituted principally with a view to 
ascertain this doctrine, and regularly prosecuted 
with a most scrupulous exactness, for eighteen 
months, fully convinced the author, many 
years ago, (as a similar course of experiments, 
prosecuted, for one year, at Charles-Town,
