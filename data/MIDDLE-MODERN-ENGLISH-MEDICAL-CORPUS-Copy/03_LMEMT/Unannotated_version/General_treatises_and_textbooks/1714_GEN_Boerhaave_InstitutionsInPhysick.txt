[}The Principles and Parts of Physick. }]
FRom the useless and fallacious Part this Science
receiv'd many things, which as they are to be 
rejected and thrown aside, we are to consider, the 
whole Scope or Design of this Art is to free or de- 
liver us from Pain, Sickness and Death; and con- 
sequently is instituted for the Preservation of pre- 
sent Health, and the Restitution of that which is 
lost; and therefore whatever is to be learnt and 
perform'd by the Physician, is to answer this End. 
For the Life, Health, Diseases or Death of Man- 
kind is the Object thereof; the Causes thereof, 
from whence they proceed, and the Means by which 
they are govern'd: From whence Medicine be- 
comes the Science or Knowledge of those things, from 
the effect of which Applications a healthful State of 
Life is continued, and the Sick restored to their 
former Condition; so that the Nobility, Usefulness, 
and Necessity of this Art naturally discover themselves. 

The solid Fundamentals or Principles are to be 
discover'd two ways, to come at a Certainty: first, 
from an accurate Observation of those Phænomena, 
which appear in Health, Sickness, Death a Cada- 
|P_6
ver, or else to the external Senses; whether they 
arise from what is in the Man himself, or from 
those things which act upon him by external Cau- 
ses, Accident or Art. 2ly, From a severe or ex- 
act Scrutiny, or are perform'd for some certain 
End. But these things can only be obtain'd by 
correct Reasoning, while the Experiments laid 
down, are distinctly examined in all their several 
Properties, from thence diligently compar'd among 
themselves, as agreeing or differing, while at the 
same time they are faithfully set down, that we 
may be able afterwards to find out what appear'd 
plain and evident therein; and in this particular, 
those of the present Age are not less to be depended 
on than Antiquity. 

Therefore that what is enquired after, may be 
discover'd from what is laid down; certain Prin- 
ciples are requisite, the Knowledge of which a- 
mounts to a Demonstration; which Reason requires 
should be distinct, clear and certain: Such are 
those which being purely corporeal in Man, are only 
mechanical and physical Experiments; for these 
explain to us the general and particular Force and 
other things which cannot be understood by those 
Principles, and therefore not to be explain'd by 
Demonstration, it will be necessary to use our ut- 
most Reason, if we wou'd avoid Mistakes, but he 
may easily see that, that considers the following things 
otherwise demonstrated, and admits as Truths. 

First, That Man is composed of Soul and Body 
united. 2ly, That these two Natures differ from 
each other; and 3ly, That he hath a Life made up 
of different Actions and Passions: 4ly, That these 
so act among themselves, that the singular or particular 
Thoughts of the Mind are joyn'd to the determi- 
nate Conditions of the Body, and so vice versâ. 
|P_7
5ly, While some Thoughts follow from one simple 
Thought alone, others are only derived from the 
alter'd State or Condition of the Body: 6ly, Like- 
wise contrary to these Operations, some make a cer- 
tain Motion in the Body without Attention, Self- 
consciousness or a Command of the Soul assisting 
them as a Cause; but there are none raised by the 
progressive Actions of the Mind, as long as a Man is 
in a healthful State; lastly, some Concretes or 
Complications are observ'd from both these. 7ly, 
Whatever involves the Thought of Man, that only 
is to be ascrib'd to the Mind, as the Author or Be- 
ginner. 8ly, But that which procures Extension or 
Motion, that is applicaple to the Body only, and its 
Motion as the Producer of it by its Properties, 
and so ought to be understood, explain'd and de- 
monstrated. 9ly, Neither can Reason fathom from 
the clearest Nature of the Mind or Body, so far as 
yet is known to Human Understanding, what 
things can act or be acted upon mutually with each 
other. 

The utmost or last Result of Metaphysical and 
Philosophical Causes, inquir'd into by the Physi- 
cians, are not necessary, useful or possible. So that 
he shou'd make Elements, or establish the Origin 
of the first Form of Seeds and Motion , but he 
may profitably apply himself to all things that are 
demonstrable in Anatomy, Chimistry, Mechanicks 
and natural Philosophy, so far as relates to the sim- 
ple Events of Facts. Then he ought to begin 
with things that are most plain, easy to be known 
and most certain, from which always going forwards 
with those which are in the next Degree, he may 
make such an accurate Progress, as to be able to 
find our such things as are more complicated, ob- 
scure and difficult. So let him proceed instructing 
from Generals to Particulars, 'til he so explains his 
Discoveries, that the Inventor may proceed from 
|P_8
Particulars to Universals; on all which, method 
will depend, first we are to enquire into Life, then 
Health, next Diseases, and last of all Medicines 
whereby they are cured. 

Therefore the first universal Doctrine in Physick 
is what we call Institutions, and this explains, first 
the Parts or Fabrick of a Human Body; 2ly, 
Life: 3ly, Health: 4ly, The Effects which natu- 
rally follow, and this is call'd the Physiological Part, 
the Human Oeconomy, or the Doctrine concerning 
the Use of the Parts; but the Objects of this Part, 
as they are reckon'd in Method are usually term'd, 
the Naturals, or those which appear according to 
the Course of Nature. 

The next Part hath relation to the living Body, 
 as first, Diseases: 2ly, The Difference of Disea- 
ses: 3ly, Their Causes: 4ly Their Effects; which 
is called the Pathology, because it treats of Diseases, or 
the Pathological Aitiology when it treats of its Causes 
Pathology or Nosology, if concerning the Differences 
thereof: Or lastly, Symptomatiology as often as it 
explains the Effects thereof. The Objects of this 
part, are those things which are preternatural or 
contrary to Nature. 

The third Part teaches us the Signs of a Di- 
sease, and how they are reduced to Use; either in 
a healthful or sick Body, as to what the State or 
Condition is, was, or will be, the Degrees, Order 
and Effect of Health or Sickness, and this comes un- 
der the Denomination of the Seimeiotical Part; the 
Objects of which are the things call'd Natural, Non- 
natural and Preternatural. 

The Fourth shews us the Remedies and their Use, 
by which Life and Health may be maintain'd, 
from whence it is term'd Hygeinial, and hath for its 
Objects the Non-naturals. 

Lastly, the Fifth Parts instructs us in the Materia 
Medica; the several Preparations of Medicines, 
|P_9
and the manner of using them in order to restore 
Health, and free us from Diseases: This is call'd 
the Therapeutick Part of Physick, containing the 
Diatetick, Pharmaceutick, Chyrurgick and method 
of Cure. Therefore we shall proceed according to 
this Order laid down and begin with the Physiolo- 
gical Part. 
[^A long horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}Of Physiology. }]
THE Human Body is compos'd, as Anatomical En- 
quiries teach us, of Solids and Fluids: The Solids 
are, either Vessels that contain the Fluids, or Instru- 
ments so formed, configurated and connected, that 
certain determinate Motions may be perform'd or 
exercis'd from this single Fabrick, if any moving 
Cause concur. For there we find Supporters, 
Pillars, Clothing or Covering, Partitions, Rollers, 
Wedges, Leavers, Pullies, Cords, Presses, Bellows, 
Sieves, Strainers, Canals and Receptacles. The Fa- 
culty of exercising these Motions is call'd a Fun- 
ction, which is agreeable to the Laws of Mecha- 
nism, by which only it can be explain'd. 

The Fluids as mention'd before, are contain'd and 
mov'd within the Solids, and in Motion are deter- 
min'd, mix'd, separated and chang'd; the Vessels 
move with the Instruments tyed to them, the Sides 
of which rub against each other, change, and re- 
turn to their Place again. These Actions are per- 
form'd according to the Hydrostatick, Hydraulick 
and Mechanick Laws, and therefore ought to 
be explain'd thereby; yet so that the most accu- 
rate Reason may be given of each Humour and eve- 
ry Action, that can be required in any kind of Ex- 
periment. 

By the Nature of Human Life, to be under- 
stood here according to common Acceptation, I 
|P_10
mean, such a Condition of the Body, as to Solids 
and Fluids, as is necessary at all times to maintain 
and carry on a mutual Commerce betwixt the 
Soul and Body, so that it may continue after 
some sort or another, or may be restored in some 
measure; neither is it necessary to be wholly broke 
or interrupted: But I will not pretend that this is 
a true Definition of Life, or that I cannot give a 
clearer Idea of Health than what is laid down 
before. 

But that we may nicely understand, what is re- 
quisite in the Body, that these Two may subsist 
together. First, We are to make a curious Col- 
lection of all the Phænomena of Life and Health. 
2ly, Enquire into the Subjects in which these are. 
3ly, Examine the Causes from whence they pro- 
ceed. 4ly, The Instruments by which they are 
made; and 5ly, The Effects which they do produce 
again. 

But since these are almost innumerable, for Me- 
thod sake we ought to reduce them to certain 
Heads, that we may treat distinctly of each of them 
in order. But first let us begin with Corporeals, 
which are common to Man and Woman, or pro- 
per to either; and since all things so cohere a- 
mongst themselves, that they move as it were in 
a Circle, causes and effects acting by mutual turns, 
whence arises an unavoidable difficulty to find out 
the order thereof, without transgressing the Me- 
thod. 

Yet the best appears from beginning with the 
Aliment taken in, and then going forward through 
the successive changes of those things in the Body, 
till it ends where these very things make the Bo- 
dy it self, and its Actions; for how the Body exists, 
or is supported from the things it receives, first 
known to sense, and continually chang'd, and how 
it acts by the same, will be most easily and clearly 
discover'd after this manner. 

|P_11
The Aliment of Food therefore, is either solid 
or liquid, and consequently either eatable or drink- 
able; the primæval matter of which was Water, 
and from that, what Earth spontaneously produced, 
as sacred, profane and fabulous History inform us, 
nay as we may discern from the very nature of 
the thing it self: Afterwards the Blood of certain 
Animals, and other parts of them were used to be 
prepar'd or dress'd together, with such eatables as 
the Earth afforded; while many, as Herodotus says 
from all Antiquity, liv'd only of Vegetables and Wa- 
ter, which some do to this day; and whole Nations 
have been contented to live thus: But Tulpius tells 
us, he saw a Man that liv'd of Grass and Hay: O- 
thers feed upon Fish only, some Flesh and Milk, 
while others eat all kinds of things, as Fish, Flesh, 
Fowl and Reptiles, which Luxury and Gluttony 
have brought into vogue, and which in all Ages of 
the World hath been practiced. Therefore with 
every one of these things alone or mix'd, crude or 
prepared, raw or dress'd, the Man that uses them 
lives, grows and is refresh'd: Neither does the vari- 
ety of Aliment produce any great difference to the 
nutrition of the Body, either as to matter or action, 
what then is the faculty in a healthful Man, which 
from changing such varieties constitute a Human 
Body? 

Nevertheless, the use of things teaches us this 
change is better perform'd according to the variety 
of the Food, or the difference of the Preparation 
from whence these were subject to alter before they 
enter'd the Body. Hence ripe Corn, dress'd and 
ground, mix'd with Water fermented and boil'd by 
the Fire, is best for preservation of Health: So 
the parts of Animals after being clean'd, dry'd, pick- 
led, boil'd, roasted, broil'd, or the like, experience 
teaches us are fitter for use; Salt, Vinegar and Spice 
afford us the particular Materials for Sawce, and are 
|P_12
the Basis of all Pickles or other Preservatives for Meat. 

Summer Fruits, if ripe, that is sost easily melt or 
dissolve, so that they need no other preparation or 
assistance. But Drink if from a pure Water and run- 
ning Stream is best crude or raw; if the Water is 
foul from Insects, or their Eggs floating therein, 
gently boiling or letting it stand for a time renders 
it better; but Drink made from Corn or Fruits 
boil'd in Water is known to be good: As that 
which is made from Malt, by steeping in Water, then 
boiling, fermenting and fining it down, which we 
call Ale or Beer; neither is the reason less clear 
and evident from the making of Cyder from ripe 
Summer Fruits press'd, then fermented or work'd 
and afterwards fin'd, which hath been so extoll'd by 
the celebrated Name of Wine: from all which Pre- 
parations proceed, attenuation, dilution, lubricity, 
fluidity, the separation of the thin from the thick, 
and consequently, we may naturally conclude the se- 
paration and excretion of the fluids is easier perform'd 
in the human Body. 
[^A long horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}Of Manducation or chewing of Victuals. }]
THE Food being thus chang'd as hinted before, 
still undergoes further Alterations in the Mouth, 
which are made first from biting: Secondly Ma- 
stication: Thirdly a Mixture of Air with the Mu- 
cous and Saliva: Biting requires the Opening or 
Abduction of the Inferior Jaw from the upper to- 
wards the Throat, directly upon the Condyliforme 
Process, under the prominence or rising of the tem- 
poral Bone, by the help of the Ligament and Inter- 
position of the cartilaginous Lamella articulated 
thereto, as Vesalius hath describ'd it. And in the next 
place, Biting requires a strong Compression of the 
lower Jaw against the upper; so that by the Teeth 
|P_13
being plac'd betwixt, the Food may be cut or ground. 

The First Action is perform'd by the Contraction 
of the Biventrian Muscles, according to Casserius, 
which arising carneous from a small Trench inden- 
ted or sunk into the Basis of the Mastoide Process, 
descending as Vesalius says, they make a Tendon, 
from whence they pass by the Stylohyoide Muscle and 
the Annular Ligament, cleaving to the side of the 
Os Hyoidis, from whence they become carneous again, 
and being supply'd with fleshy Fibres from the very 
Os Hyoidis; they ascend even to the very inward 
middle and lower part of the Chin, and are there 
inserted: So that by this piece of Mechanism the 
Strength and Direction or Tendency of these Muscles 
are understood, not without great Admiration at the 
artful Fabrick. 

The latter Action which consists of bringing the 
Jaws together with force, is perform'd by the Con- 
traction of the Temporal Muscles, says Vesalius, 
which being united with a large semicircular carne- 
ous Origine from the hollow of the Os Frontis, sinks 
into the Sphenoide and Temporal Bone, together 
with the Fibres running under the Os Jugale, which 
being strengthen'd and determined by the Fibres 
taken from thence; they become all about tendinous, 
but as yet carneous, on every side of Coronoide
Process of the lower Jaw; the Masseters which says 
Vesalius are carneous, and arise thick from the First 
Bone of the lower Jaw, and the Jugal Bone, here 
crossing their Fibres, they mutually insert themselves 
into the inferior, and exterior Margin or Edge of the 
lower Jaw, from the point or corner of the Chin, for 
near four Fingers breadth. The external Pterygoides
which Fallopius and after him Verbeyen remarks, that 
arise from the outward Part of the exterior Wing of 
the Pterygoide Process, in the Sphenoide Bone, and 
the upper Part of the same Sphenoide Bone, running 
backwards are inserted by a strong Tendon, in the 
|P_14
semilunar Space, situated in the internal Part of the 
lower Jaw, betwixt the Condyloide and Coronoide Pro- 
cess: The internal Pterygoides, according to Fallopius, 
Verbeyen and Cowper in his Appendix to Bidloo, which 
arising carneous and tendinous from the whole in- 
ward Superficies of the external Lamella of the Pte- 
rygoide Process; progressively descending broad and 
strong, have deep Impressions made in the Tendon, 
a little above the internal Angle or Point of the 
lower Jaw under the great Apophyses: For if the 
eight Muscles describ'd act together, the lower Jaw 
must be squeez'd or press'd with incredible force 
against the upper, and the eight cutting Teeth, 
being thus strongly compress'd makes the Action of 
biting. 

Hence the Meat or Food thus divided, is thrown 
among the Molares or Grinders; whose Superficies 
are broad, that they may perform the Action of At- 
trition: The straightning or holding of the Jaws 
strict together, proceeds first from the Contraction 
of the Buccinator or Trumpeters Muscle, which Cow- 
per says, arising broad and carneous in its beginning 
from the Fore Part of the Coronoide Process of the 
lower Jaw, sticks with strait Fibres in the Gums of 
each Jaw, which going forward thro' the Cheeks is 
inserted in the Angle of the Lips. The Orbicularis
of the Lips, says the same Author, which performs 
the opening of the Mouth and Lips with its carneous 
Fibres is inserted into no Bone at all. The Zygoma- 
tick Muscle which hath a carneous rise from the 
external Part of the Os Jugalis descending obliquely 
is inserted about the corner of the Lips, the common 
Elevator of the Lips which is inserted from the fourth 
Bone of the upper Jaw to the meeting of the Lips, 
in its own Tendon under that of the former, the 
proper Elevator of the upper Lip, which from the 
same fourth Bone hath immediately its rise upon the 
former obliquely descending, disappears under the 
|P_15
Skin of the upper Lip: The proper Depressors of the 
under Lip arising from the lower Part of the Jaw 
next the Chin, are inserted into the under Lip: The 
proper Elevator of the under Lip, which springs 
from the lower part of the Gum of the under Jaw, 
is inserted into the lowermost Part of the Skin of 
the Chin: Lastly, by the Help of the common De- 
pressor of the Lips, which arises carneous from the 
lower Edge of the lower Jaw, about its sides the as- 
cending is inserted to the corner of the Mouth or Lips. 

If all these act together, then the Cheeks and Lips 
are so clos'd to the Gums and Teeth, that neither 
Meat nor Drink can fall betwixt them; but if they 
move successively, they are directed to different pla- 
ces; In the next place the same Constriction is made 
by the Tongue, the Muscle chiefly voluble through 
all, and easily moveable to every Part of the Mouth 
is acted: First, by the Muscles call'd Genioglossi, 
arising from the internal part of the Chin by a car- 
neous Beginning, issuing out by Dilatations, and in- 
serted into the root of the Tongue, which draw the 
Tongue forward, and contract it back again, and 
as Cowper further shews, the Ceratoglossi arising from 
a broad carneous Beginning on the side of the Os 
Hyoidis, from whence ascending by a large Duct of 
Fibres, we see them dispers'd thro' the Tongue, 
they move it back, depress and extend it: The 
Styloglossi which arising from an external Part of the 
Styloide Process of the Temporal Bone, by an acute 
Beginning obliquely descending, insert themselves 
by the hind Part of the Tongue, which they raise, 
draw side ways and extend. Secondly, by the Mus- 
cles forming the very Body of the Tongue which 
are according to Malpighius Longitudinal, they ren- 
der the Tongue shorter, but transversly they draw it 
narrower, perpendicularly they lessen its Thickness: 
There are others that draw the Back and Sides of the 
Tongue, and some angular Muscles that contract it 
|P_16
inward, others that depress the Back Part ridge ways, 
or to a point, and strait or right ones compressing the 
Basis thereof: All which singly or conjunct easily 
explain the determinate Motion of the Tongue in 
the Action, it performs in the Mouth towards Di- 
rection of the Meat and Drink either to the Grinders 
or the Gullet; adding thereto the Action of the 
Fibres on the external Muscles out of the Tongue, 
which move together with them. But it is plain that 
besides the Motion of the Jaw, backwards, forwards 
and sideways, that the Victuals are ground and broke 
to pieces, by the Muscles of the Cheeks and Lips 
and the Tongue, without having regard to the 
Teeth plac'd in the Mandables, to which Motion over 
and above there are other Changes made by the Mix- 
ture of the Saliva and the Mucus of the Palate and 
Jaws, together with the Intromission of Air. 
[^A long horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}The Origin, Nature and Mixture of the Saliva. }]
FIrst according to the Notions of Steno, Nuck, and 
Valsalva, at the Root of the Ear in a small hollow, 
betwixt the Mamillary Process, the Condyloide and 
the Os Jugale, adheres a complex conglomerate 
gland making a Sinus, whence spreading it self breadth 
ways, it reaches to the anterior, inferior and back 
Parts; this Secerns the Saliva by its Configuration 
or Make, from the Arterial Blood, and deposites it 
into a common Duct, which perforating the Buccina- 
tor, about the third upper Grinder of the Teeth 
pours it into the Mouth. Wharton saith, that there 
is a large internal Maxillary gland seated betwixt the 
Jaws, possessing almost the whole Length thereof, 
which separates the Saliva likewise from the same 
Arterial Source, throwing it into an excretory Duct 
that rises on the back Part of it, and makes its way 
forward, almost to the fore-cutting Teeth, but in 
|P_17
the middle way admits of two side Branches, from 
which spring two others that convey this Saliva to 
the Forepart of the Tongue. 

There are glands says Bartholine, that appear under 
the Tongue, for that the Palate, Gums and Lips, are 
perforated by little Ducts and Sluces, thro' which an 
Humour or Flind much like the Saliva, but a great 
deal thinner flows. Schneider and Nuck both allow 
the glands of the Palate, especially the hind Part as 
well as those of the Uvulæ and Tonsillæ to separate a 
Mucus that mixes it self with the Aliment: But all 
these Fountains and Sluces are so seated, that they 
may emit their Liquors chiefly upon the Motion of 
Manducation or chewing. And Nuck makes it a 
Question, whether in Man there be any other Sali- 
vatory Gland or Duct? 

The Saliva is a diluted Humour or Fluid, which 
is pellucid, will not congeal or thicken by the Fire, 
and is almost void of Tast and Smell; if shak'd it will 
hardly froth, it is glandulous Liquor secreted from 
pure Arterial Blood; more copious fluid and sharp 
by Abstinence; but long fasting makes it very acrid, 
penetrating, deterging and resolving: Flowers, 
Meal, or succulent Vegetables encreases its Fermen- 
tation; it is thinner in Brutes, healthful Men and 
such as sleep much; too great a voluntary Secretion 
or Discharge of it, creates or procures an Anorexia, 
Dyspnæa and Atrophia or wasting: Water and Spirits 
makes it abound, but Salt and Oil decreases and 
makes it less in Quantity. 

The Motion of Mastication therefore by expressing 
the Saliva, and mixing it intimately with the Ali- 
ment, tends, first to promote the Nutrition of the 
Body. 2ly, To mix the oleous with the aqueous 
Parts. 3ly, For the Solution of the Saliva. 4ly, 
Fermentation. 5ly, An Alteration of Taste and 
Smell. 6ly, Exciting the intestine Motion in the 
mean time by the Assistance of Air, Aliment, Saliva, 
|P_18
and Mucus, well mix'd and incorporated together, by 
the weight of Fluidity, Elasticity, Heat of Bo- 
dy, and variety of Pressure at all times, there is 
Attenuation, Production of Fluxibility, and a Con- 
tinuation of intestine Motion throughout the whole 
Mass. 

Thus being subdued and rendred tractable, attenua- 
ted, moisten'd, and lubricated the Food or Meat, is 
protruded towards the Gullet, whilst being bound 
there, by the Muscles of the Cheeks and Lips toge- 
ther with the Motion of the Tongue, it is com- 
press'd betwixt this and what Bidloo calls the forni- 
cated Palate, and the foldings between the Cheeks 
and the Oesophagus, while the Genioglossi, the Dorsi 
Longitudinales, the Styloglossi and Ceratoglossi by succes- 
sive Motion act upon the hollow Root of the Tongue 
under Cowper's Vail of the Palate, the Uvula and Al- 
mond glands upon the Larynx, and Pharynx; and for- 
ming before the Membranes that cover them those 
Bodies of the Vertebræ of the Neck, which assist Deg- 
lutition or swallowing. 

Then from the Action of the Genioglossi, the Genio- 
hyoideus as Casserius mentions arising from the inward 
Part of the Chin, is fix'd about the Articulation of 
the smaller Cornua of the Cartilages of the Os Hyoidis; 
the Mylohyoideus which proceeds in a large Tendon 
from the middle Part of the Basis of the Os Hyoidis; 
is tyed or fix'd again by a large Aponeurosis to the 
lower Mandible, near the Grinders even to the Fore 
Parts possessing that Space which lies betwixt the 
Os Hyoidis, and the insides of the lower Jaw. The 
Styloceratohyoideus which springs from an acute carne- 
ous Beginning of the Styliforme Process of the Tem- 
poral Bone, obliquely descending forward, penetra- 
ted by the Digastrick is inserted into the Articulation 
of the larger Cornua with the Os Hyoidis; the Root of 
the Tongue is extended and lifted up, which being 
apply'd to the Vail of the Palate, the Foramen of 
|P_19
opening into the Nostrils is shut thereby; likewise 
the Os Hyoidis and the Larynx, assisted by the Con- 
traction of the Thyrohyoideus of Aquapendent, which 
arising carneous from the side of the Os Hyoidis, in 
its descent it is tyed to the lower Part of the Scuti- 
forme Cartilage, they are raised up, and by the Pres- 
sure made in swallowing they shut the Epiglottis, and 
apply or clap the Uvula to the Chink of the Glottis; 
expressing from the Palate, Tonsillæ, Uvula, the Root 
of the Tongue, Epiglottis and Glands thereof, a slip- 
pery Mucus, they do not only come round in De- 
glutition, but they move forward, at the same time 
the Root of the Tongue, the Os Hyoidis and the La- 
rynx; so that they open the Pharynx as Valsalva re- 
lates, relaxing the Oesophagus according to Cowper, and 
so by that means perform the act of swallowing: But 
at the same time the internal and external Gargareon
Muscles as Fallopius and Riolan call them, elevate 
the Vail of the Palate, extend it every way governing 
the Uvula, so in swallowing they open the Glottis
which being fallen, they occasion an Eructation, or 
casting up thro' the Nostrils. 

From hence relaxing all that were contracted, 
both the Sternohyoidei move, which from the internal 
Part of the Clavicle near the Sternum, ascending with 
a broad carneous Beginning is inserted forward into 
the Basis of the Os Hyoidis; the Coracocerato hyoideis, 
which arising from a round carneous Beginning of 
the upper Part of the Scapula to the Root of the Co- 
racoide Process in the Progress making two Bellies, 
is affix'd to the Forepart of the Os Hyoidis. So the 
Pharynx being shut at the same time constringes the 
Oesophagus, arising on each side of the Scutiforme
Cartilage, and running into each postick Line of 
the Gullet, by the force of swallowing they close in 
the hollow of the Oesophagus, under the Pharynx. 

Which Tube saith Verheyen, consisting of divers 
Membranes, depending mutually on each other, 
|P_20
which by the Assistance of the first Mucus con- 
constantly moistens the internal Cavity, rendring 
the Saliva more oily, whereby it affords a slippery 
Passage indeglutition, and gives a necessary Flexi- 
bility to its Fibres. In the next place, where it 
depends on the former glandulous Coat, there a 
Juice is express'd by the canals into the hollow of 
the Tube, and here the Musculous Bodies are en- 
compass'd by the orbicular Fibres, which are bound 
in by the Longitudinal; and at last all the fine 
thinner Parts are involved in a fibrous and vascu- 
lous Membrane. Therefore by the Contraction of 
the longitudinal and orbicular Fibres the lubricous 
Deglutition is made, by the fat way being dilated in 
swallowing, whence the Aliment is protruded thro' 
the relax'd open Passage into the very Mouth of the 
Stomach; and therefore where is descends, the up- 
per Flesh as Bartholine says of the lower Muscle of 
the Diaphragm, binding or constringing the Gullet 
there, as it passes by, shuts the Stomach or Ventricle
in this Part. 

[}The Action of the Stomach upon the Aliment. }]
THE Meat and Drink being swallowed, shut up 
in the Stomach, entertain'd with Heat, and 
mix'd with the Air, according to the variety of mat- 
ter, begins in this Place naturally to ferment or pu- 
trefie, either of which ways it is wonderfully chan- 
ged, into a sour, sweet, or rancid Mass. 

The ragged Coat of the Stomach which receive 
the Aliment, is furnish'd partly with a hairy, tubu- 
lous, rough, moist, glutinous Cavity, and partly 
convex supply'd with many different small Glands 
which arise from the vasculous Coat that adheres to 
it, abounding with Arteries, Veins and Nerves: There- 
fore from its small Sluices or Canals, it constantly 
|P_21
emits a thin, subtle, pellucid, spumous Fluid, en- 
rich'd with Spirits, moderately salt, and in the most 
voracious Animals, not Alcaline nor Acid, but in 
long fasting acrid, which is secreted out of the small 
Ducts of the Gastrick Arteries, besides a smooth Mucus
Humour from the Glands, collected in little Bags, 
and express'd thence into the Cavity or hollow of 
the Ventricle: Large Contractions of the Stomach 
makes great Foldings, which stops the Aliment cau- 
sing an acrid Ferment and assisting the Attrition or 
breaking of the Food to a Pulp, exciting thereby 
Hunger: Malpighius and Peyerius inform us, that such 
Animals as want this villous Coat and these Liquors, 
have a Crop or Craw, and Sinus or Receptacle be- 
fore the Ventricle, which consists of almost the like 
Texture and Humours. 

If we consider in what Plenty the Saliva continu- 
ally flows upon this Part to the Food, both from the 
Mouth and Gullet, perpetually diluting what is up- 
on the Stomach, agitating the various Parts, effe- 
ctually giving Motion to them by the Admission of 
Air, and exciting Heat in the Part; by which means 
we shall see the Effects perform'd of Maceration and 
Dilution, and the Aliment so attenuated and dis- 
solv'd that Fermentation is procur'd, and thus adap- 
ted to enter into the Passages and Humours of our 
Body: Yet we cannot from hence discern how the 
Solids, that are not yet chew'd and broken to pie- 
ces, become successfully digested in the Stomach. 

But that the Cause inquired after, may be found 
out, let us look into the Muscular Fabrick of the 
Stomach, and consider what Actions depend there- 
on: Then it will appear that the carneous Mem- 
brane of the Stomach, according to Willis is com- 
pos'd on the convex Part of strong Fibres, which 
beginning at the upper Orifice proceed to the Pylo-
rus in an orbicular or spiral Order, and surround 
its Cavity in a perpendicular Situation almost the 
|P_22
whole Length thereof, and bind it length ways by 
its Contraction, but on the concave or hollow Part, 
it consists of Fibres, first of all oblique, which con- 
tract the bottom of the Stomach, obliquely towards 
its back Part, and towards the upper Orifice, and 
so length ways lessening the Contraction: In the 
next place, it hath strong Fibres, spreading over the 
Pylorus by a Parallel Course length ways, united 
on the back Part, running round the upper Orifice, 
and so they open the Mouth of the Stomach when 
empty, and shut the upper Orifice when full, closely 
constraining the lower. 

It is likewise plain, that this Membrane is still girt 
as Willis observes, with another extreme one, which 
on the Convex Part is very vasculous, but on the 
Concave fibrous, with a Parallel Longitudinal Duct 
which helps the Constriction or binding length 
ways; and therefore these Fibres are very springy, 
but are not altogether strong enough to discharge the 
Stomach, where they act together, they shut the 
Orifices, forcibly press or squeeze the distended 
Contents, mix and grind them with the vermicular 
Motion, attenuating the gross Mass contain'd in the 
Stomach, driving the more fluid Parts towards the 
Sinus, before the Pylorus, by which being contracted 
but less closed than the upper Orifice, the thinnest 
Part which is reduced to a pulpy matter, first is by 
degrees leisurely thrust into the Duodenum. 

By such a Motion only says Harvey, but more vi- 
olent many Animals use to macerate their Food: 
Our hearing saith Borellus is witness of this, so that 
Observation demonstrates it effectually; but the 
Nervous and Muscular Fabrick of this Viscera informs 
us that there is the like in our selves. 

Whether or no, or from what Cause can we un- 
derstand, why little Meat and Drink received shall 
make the Stomach evacuate or discharge? Why the 
|P_23
Stomach too much loaded shou'd not do the same or 
digest, but vomit up crude that which hath lain 
there some time? What Reason can be given that 
tho' we greedily and at once pour down Liquors, 
the Stomach shall certainly retain them. 

But these Things not yet appearing sufficient to 
explain the Alteration of the Aliment made in 
the Stomach; we ought further to have regard to, 
or bring under our Consideration. First the perpe- 
tual nourishing Heat of the ambient Parts. 2dly, 
The innumerable Motions or Strokes of the Arteries 
that are in the Stomach, Diaphragm, Caul, Spleen, 
Liver, Pancreas, Mesentey and Perionæum. 3dly, 
The forcible Vibrations of the Aorta it self. 4ly, 
The Strength of the Nervous Liquor in no place 
more plentiful than here. 5thly, The continual Re- 
ciprocal and strong Compression of almost all the 
Peritonæum, by the great Diaphragm as Bartholin and 
Vesalius both call it, which ascends from the right 
inferior Part of the Three First Vertebræ of the Loins, 
on the left, from the last and last but one Vertebræ of 
the Thorax, arising from a tendinous and then a car- 
neous Beginning with streight Fibres on the upper 
Part, springing from a thin membranous Beginning, 
it presently grows carneous from all the side of the 
cartilaginous Top of the inferior Ribs and the lowest 
Part of the Sternum, running downwards with a 
Hundred creeping Fibres; it becomes tendinous, 
and is intermix'd or confounded with the former: 
From whence acting as from a Convex, it is plane, 
and binds the Abdomen and its Contents; strongly 
compressing Ten Abdominal Muscles with one united 
Contraction, and governing the Abdomen by its re- 
ciprocal Motions and great Strength, as Contem- 
plation informs us. 

For first saith Vesalius, the oblique, exterior, ten- 
dinous and carneous Part, arises from the lower side 
of the Ribs, descending it grows tendinous, and is 
|P_24
inserted into the linea alba, the Os Pubis, the ante- 
rior and upper Side of the Os Ilium. 2dly, Accor- 
ding to Spigelius, the oblique inferior carneous Part 
arises from the circular Course of the Os Pubis, grow- 
ing tendinous, from the fore bending Fibres, and is 
inserted into the linea alba and the Cartilages of the 
Ribs. Fallopius saith it is pyramidal and carneous 
from the anterior upper Part of the Os Pubis, grows 
tendinous to the linea alba, and is inserted into the 
Navel; with Vesalius, it is transverse from a carneous 
Rise, of the transverse Processes of the Vertebræ of 
the Loins, and derives it self from the Spine of the 
Os Ilium, the Ligament of the Os Pubis, and the 
cartilaginous End of the Ribs, beneath the Sternum, 
being inserted with a broad Tendon to all the linea 
alba under the right Abdominal. Lastly, Spigelius
affirms the right carneous one comes from the Xi- 
phoide Cartilage, the Cartilages of both lower true 
Ribs, the Cartilages of both the upper Bastard Ribs, 
consisting of five tendinous and five carneous Parts, 
and at last is inserted into the upper anterior Part of 
the Os Pubis. 

But if we think the Force of all these Causes, 
conspiring together in one united Work sufficient 
to render the Mass in one place soft and soluble 
enough, we may truly see the Effects which happen 
to this Part, the consequences of which ought to be. 
First, That Moveables be mix'd with Fluids, to le- 
vigate and resolve into Fluidity to produce a ci- 
neritious or ash Colour, to press by degrees, and 
squeez our what is contain'd therein. 2ly, That 
the more tenacious remains be kept or with-held 
from the first Operations, and that the same Cau- 
ses coninuing, they undergo the same Work, and 
shew the same Phænomena as first. 3ly, That Fibres, 
Membranes, Cartilages, the Bones, and the hardest 
Parts of vegetable things be render'd juicy or li- 
quid, and lastly, that they be expell'd the Stomach, 
|P_25
yet cohering in Form. 4ly, That by dissolving 
Vegetable and Animal Food, a Humour be made 
Analogous to that of our own. 5ly, That there 
be made a speedy Restoration to the Feeble from 
want of Strength; whilst the subtle Fluid recei- 
ved by the Pipes or Canals, from the Mouth, Gul- 
let and Stomach, opening and evacuating themselves 
into the Lymphaticks, is from hence sent by a short 
Road into the sanguineous Veins, and thence im- 
mediately by the assistance of the Arteries, distri- 
buted into all Parts of the Body. 

Therefore whether the Heat alone be the Sto- 
mach's Cook? or it be the vital Acor or Sharpness 
that is in the Stomach, inspiring Life, as natural 
to that Ventricle? Whether Digestion be deficient 
without Acid? What thick, salt, acid or bitter Hu- 
mor, causes such Ructations in the Breast of a 
healthful Man, and whence this arises? Whether 
it be a different or various Cause that excites Hun- 
ger, and what it is? Why the Stomach swells in 
Digestion; but is flaccid or lank when empty? 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}The Action of the Intestines or Guts upon the 
Aliment. }]
THat it may be rightly understood what happens 
to the Chyle of the Stomach, and the remain- 
ing Fæces in the Guts, we will consider the Fabrick 
or Structure of this Duct, the Humors drawn from 
thence, the absolving Vessels, their Motion, and 
that of the circumjacent Parts. First, The Coat or 
Covering of the small Guts, which contains the 
Chyle, is rough, broad and perforated with aqueous 
and glutinous Pipes, with the Mouths of the Lacteals 
and large Apertures, which being distinct, afford a 
wat'ry, glutinous Humor, that constantly moistens 
|P_26
and lubricates a musculous one lying upon it, which 
is very rough, here especially, where it is tyed to 
the Mesentery; and convex with a vasculous, glan- 
dulous and nervous Part; from whence 'tis a Check 
to the Chyle and Fæces, a continual Interception of 
these, the Lubrication and Defence of the Cavity, dai- 
ly Dilution of the grosser Fæces, especially about 
the end of the Ileum, where there is an Oiliness of the 
solider Excrement. 

Here is another thin Coat, according to Willis, 
except we will suppose it to be part of the same, 
consisting of a reticular Texture of an innumerable 
quantity of arterial, veinous and nervous Vessels, 
which adhere almost to the Basis of the Peyerian
Glands, the tops of which opening to the Superfi- 
cies, supply it with a Gelly or Mucus, these in the 
begining of the small Guts are few, but increase 
in Size and Number; from whence proceeds Heat, 
Pulsation, Trituration, Dilution, Lubrication and 
a Defence. 

A muscular Coat surrounds this, with a concave 
Part, strengthen'd with thick, firm, annular Fibres, 
inserted into the Sides or Borders of the Mesentery
as a Tendon; from whence the whole Cavity of the 
small Guts is bound successively by Parts with 
rising Valves that play backwards and forwards re- 
ciprocally; the Contents are lodg'd in the rough 
Sides of the Intestine, where they are ground, mix'd, 
attenuated, and hindred from Concretion, the very 
sides of the Guts, being rub'd off from the Convex 
Part length-ways the first striking against them, 
with which folding in, they are contracted, and are 
strench'd out-right, especially in Places from the Re- 
gion of Mesentery to which they are tyed. 

The last external Coat of all that wraps in the 
former, is from the Peritonæum, and knit to the 
Mesentery. This whole long Duct, Pipe or Canal, is 
tyed short to the Borders or Sides of the Mesentery; 
|P_27
it hangs downwards, and is gathered or folded 
wonderfully into a great many Turns or Windings, 
almost every way, being cloth'd and interspers'd 
with Fat, beside the Lubrication it receives from the 
gentle Exhalations or Dew of the Caul; it is re- 
laxed and render'd moveable; is extended or 
stretch'd under the Peritonæum, with which, by the 
Motion of other ambient Causes, they perform reci- 
procal Actions together: In a healthful Condition, it 
only wants diluting, the Fæces growing thick, or the 
nearer their Exclusion, in a sound and lively State 
this Vessel is wonderfully contracted; it is perpe- 
tually agitated by the Peristaltick Motion, where- 
fore it becomes more apt for grinding, bruising, se- 
parating, dissolving, attetuating and volatilizing, 
from whence it propels the Chyle into the Mouths 
of the Lacteals, and these are common to the whole 
Tract or Circuit of this Vessel. 

In the Duodenum its Rectitude and Narrowness is 
proper to it, but it is laxer at its knitting to the Me- 
særaick, the Perforation at the end for the common 
Passage of the Bile and the Pancreatick Duct of 
Wirsungius otherwise joyned together, according to 
Glisson and Graef, are sometimes separated or divided; 
wherefore the celebrated Passage to the Chyle is 
made by these Mouths, by this way you may dis- 
cover a triple Humour entring the Cavity of the 
Gut, to wit, the Cystick and Hepatick Bile as well as 
the Lympha from the Pancreas. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}Of the Action of the Cystick and Hepatick Bile. }]
THE Bile of the Bladder is thicker, of a deeper 
yellow, bitterer, and which does not constantly 
flow into the Intestines, but is secern'd copiously by 
external Compression, and the Contraction of the 
irritated Fibres. But the  Hepatick Bile is thinner, 
|P_28
more pellucid, softer, and flows drop by drop, be- 
ing only expell'd by the Actions of the Ducts and 
Humours about it. Thirdly, The Pancreatick Juice 
is almost perpetually secerning; from which when 
it meets with the Saliva and Mucus of the Mouth, 
Gullet, Stomach and Guts, it makes a spumous or 
frothy Liquor, and sometimes a little clammy, 
which is often squeez'd up into the Stomach when 
empty. 

But the Cystick Bile resists, sharps and sours, and 
is furnish'd with another Faculty peculiar to it self; 
it is saponaceous, absterges and makes Oils mix 
with Water; it dissolves Rosins and the most tena- 
cious Gums, and makes them homogeneous, is nei- 
ther Alcalick nor Acid, but coagulates Oil, Salt 
and Spirits diluted with Water; will not burn, ex- 
cept it be first dry'd, and is the most biting or sharp- 
est of all the Humors of the Body; wherefore its 
Effects are when mix'd with the Chyle and Fæces to 
attenuate, absterge and stimulate the moving Fibres, 
to intermix those Fluids which are of different kinds, 
to break the acrid saline Parts, and divide the co- 
agulated or thick ones, to expedite the way for the 
Chyle, excite or provoke the Appetite to serve in- 
stead of a ferment, and to assimulate the crude to 
the Parts digested, in these the Cystick Bile much 
exceeds the Hepatick, the Description of which I 
shall refer to the Liver. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}Of the Action of the Pancreatick Lympha. }]
UNder the hind Part, and the bottom of the 
Stomach, in the first Place the hangs in the po- 
sterior Lamella of the Caul, a large conglomerate 
Gland, call'd by Wharton, Graef and Vesalius, the Pan- 
creas, which by the Assistance of the Cæliack Arte- 
ries and the Texture of the Gland secerns a Humor 
|P_29
of Fluid into one common Duct, which makes its 
Exit into the Duodenum, and from thence brings all 
that Lympha; but it is almost insipid, in Taste some- 
what salt, limpid, plentiful, always making and 
emitting, neither acid nor alcaline, but analogous to 
the Saliva, confusedly mix'd with the Bile in living 
Bodies, being digested therewith, and adhering in 
the same Pipe or Tube with it, is not observ'd to give 
any Assistance to the Motion of the Gut, but is 
equally distributed thro' it, and sometimes flows 
alone into the Empty Intestines, hence the Use of it 
is to mix with the Chyle, Fæces, Gall and Mucus, 
in order to dilute their grosser Parts and render 
them more fluid and thin, that they may better mix 
together, to render the Chyle more miscible in the 
Blood, and to adapt it for a readier Passage 
thro' the Lacteals, to soften its Austereness, Viscidity 
and Bitterness, to chance its Colour, and intermix 
it perfectly with the Chyle, to make it capable of 
performing the Office of a Menstruum and Vehicle, so 
to change the singular Taste and Smell of Food, 
that it becomes as it were almost indolent, and that 
the Chyle may be able to go and return this way 
with Ease and Expedition. 

Wherefore being strongly question'd wilt thou an- 
swer, whether the Bile be double? Whether an 
Excrement of the Hepatick Chyle, while the Blood is 
there return'd back? or whether it produces any 
Advantage to Health and Life? but what is that? 
in short whether the Pancreas and Bile answer the 
System of Helmont and Sylvius? or whether they 
become aDuumvirate here and what? whether they 
can excite and sustain Life from the Intestine Mo- 
tion of the Blood? what the Pancreatick Juice is, 
and to what end? why does it flow with the Bile, 
or at least next it? whether the Animal can live 
well without it? 

|P_30
[}The Propulsion of the Chyle into the Lacteals. }]
BY the Contraction of the strait Fibres of the In- 
testines, which are inserted to their external 
Coats as a Tendon, the Vessel or Pipe is made rough 
in the Part which is turn'd back from the Mesentery, 
hence from the spiral Tube it acquires a Cylin- 
drick Figure, by which means in the Part joyn'd to 
the Mesentery it is lax, in the Part against the Me- 
sentery it is constring'd; wherefore the Passages or 
Pores next the Mesentery, that is, the Mouths of the 
Lacteals, are found lax and open to the Fuid, 
moveable and lubricated Chyle, by which it may 
readily enter; in the mean time the Valves being 
strengthen'd by the same Force erect, mutually ap- 
proach each other, intercept the Chyle, stop it, and 
almost close the contracted Part of the Intestine. 

Also by the orbicular contracted Fibres, inserted 
into the Mesentery as a Tendon, the Cylindrick Spaces 
are contracted, and shut up by the Valves mutually 
pressing to each other, wherefore the Chyle by means 
of this Force, and the Action of the ambient Bodies, 
is squeez'd out, diluted, mix'd and driven towards 
the proper Places in the Mesentery, that is, it is for- 
ced into the Mouths af the Lacteals, which are best 
open'd by the Peristaltick Motion: Yet the fermen- 
ting Chyle enters not the Lacteals by its own Ener- 
gy. That Chyle therefore that enters the Mouths of 
the Lacteals, is falsly suppos'd to be only the Produ- 
ction of Meat and Drink, for it is a Fluid or Hu- 
mour consisting chiefly of Saliva, the thin Mucus 
of the Mouth, that double Liquor of the Gullet and 
Stomach, of the Cystick and Hepatick Bile the Pancrea- 
tick Lympha, of Peyerius intestinal Humor, and as 
Brunnerus of the Pancreas says, of that strong, 
copious and subtle Liquor, supply'd from an innu- 
merable quantity of Nerves; for all these Humors, 
|P_31
whether passing thro', flowing out, or mix'd with 
the Chyle, are always entring the Lacteals, tho' they 
are only conspicuous or visible a little after eating. 

Whether or no the thin, bilious and lymphatick 
 Part of that Chyle is not more received into the ab- 
sorbing Vessels, that open upon the inward Super- 
ficies of the Guts, and empty or discharge them- 
selves into the Meseraick Veins, from whence there 
is a Dilution made in the Vena Porta, and new Mat- 
ter for the Bile to secern? Certainly the Number 
of these, their Largeness, and singular Texture or 
Make about the Intestines, their common Nature 
with all Veins, the Humor flowing hence, as well 
into the Vena Porta as the Artery: The Disposition 
of this Fluid; the great quantity of Humors meet- 
ing in the Intestines, which are not all received by 
the Lacteals, neither are they observ'd to be expell'd 
by Siege. Comparative Anatomy not finding La- 
cteals in OviparousAnimals, and yet discovering a 
Passage in the Meseraicks from the Cavity of the 
Intestines, this Enquiry is answer'd. 

Since all the Phænomena seem to depend on Meat 
and Drink, from the first Reception of them, to 
their Entrance into the Lacteals, their Consequen- 
ces seem clearly, naturally, and distinctly demon- 
strable from the Structure, Fabrick and Strength of 
the Vessels, the natural Knowledge of the Humors, 
and their virtual Operation demonstrable to Sense 
or reasonable Mechanicks; whether these ought 
to be call'd Postulata, that are obscure, doubtful and 
dissonant to Reason and Experiments? Heat is 
call'd the Cook of the Stomach, its native Life, and 
what renders the Sourness thereof volatile. The 
Archæus, the Smith, the Alcaline Bile, fermenting 
changes the fix'd acid Chyle into a volatile salt one, 
the Sharpness of the Pancreatick Lympha, and the Ef- 
fervescence with the Alcaline Bile, the Precipitation 
that depurates or fines down the Chyle: Peripate- 
|P_32
tick, Galenick, and Chymick Faculties; with a 
thousand other pernicious Hypotheses and false No- 
tions that give Laws and Rules to Physick. 
[^A horizontal line, spanning the whole page. ^]
[}The Matter and Expulsion of the Intestinal 
Fæces. }]
THE grosser part of the Aligment received, stick- 
ing obstinately in the Mouths or Orifices of 
the Lacteals, is loosed as it were by the Force of 
Manducation, the liquid Part being absorb'd, by the 
continual Gyration or Motion of the small Guts 
and the Structure of the Valves therein, driving the 
Solid by degrees into narrower and straiter Places, 
the lubricated Fat of the Glands giving way, it be- 
comes press'd, squeez'd, macerated, and drawn dry 
from any more Juice, 'til at last it is successively 
thrust forward into the wide Gut, call'd Cæcum. 

The Diverticulum or Turning aside of the Cæcum
as Vesalius will have it, the vermicular Intestine, the 
Valve of Tulpius, from hence make a perpendicular 
Ascent in the first Colon, that it cannot return into 
the Ileum, but stagnating here, the Fæces being 
strongly press'd from their own Weight, the Action 
of the Gut and the external Parts about it; they 
are deprived of all Moisture which is absorb'd into 
the Lymphaticks: Hence they discharge or empty 
their Humors into the alveum lacteum, then the Fæces
grow hard and dry, and putrifying at last, gain a 
fœtid Stench, and become Excrement or Dung: 
Then the Valves which are here so common, says 
Bartholin, and made of muscular contracting Liga- 
ments, by their bending or winding in, shew where 
the Stoppage is made, that the Fæces are retain'd 
so long; from hence the strong, membranous mus- 
cular Fibres, by the Strength of their Contraction, 
|P_33
make the Fæces hard and immoveable, so that they 
would not be easily driven thro' the long Canal of 
the Guts, but as they are lubricated by the Fat of 
the Glands, as Peyerius asserts, and thereby sent into 
the Intestinum Rectum. 

The almost perpendicular Descent of which, says 
Vesalius, the internal Superficies whereof being smooth 
or lubricated without Valves or any Muscular Liga- 
ment, makes that being driven thus far, the Fæces
readily descend by their weight or acrimony, or 
both, irritating the strong Muscular Fibres, com- 
pressing the Gut, till the Fæces stick at the Sphincter. 
Then relaxing the large, gross, carneous, orbicular 
Sphincter as Bidleo calls it, that surrounds the end of 
the Intestinum rectum, the Levators of the Anus are 
contracted, which from the internal Part of the 
Bones of the Pubis, Ischium and Sacrum, which stri- 
king the End of the Rectum with their winding Fi- 
bres, they dilate and raise it up. Hence by inspi- 
ring, Retension, Rarefaction, Compression of the 
Breast, the Assistance of Air, and then of the Dia- 
phragm and abdominal Muscles, the Fæces are expel- 
led, while the Sphincter is only contracted. 

From whence it appears what the matter of the 
Fæces is: Whether it consists of the Recrement of the 
Bile, Blood, Mucus, Saliva or Lympha: What its par- 
ticular Cause is: Whether from an excrementitious 
Ferment: Why the Intestines from thence have 
more Glands and more Mucus proper to their 
purpose: What Use Fat is of to the Guts, chiefly 
at the end: Why strong People are costive, have 
hard Stools and few of them: Why the Hemorrhoides
are so common to such: Why in Exoneration, Urine 
is discharg'd together with Siege: Why the Tenesmus
attend such as labour under the Stone in the Blad- 
der? Why the Strangury, in the Bloody Flux, and 
why the Tenesmus in the Strangury. 

|P_34
[}The Action of the Mesentery upon the Chyle. }]
THat Chyle which is impell'd by the Peristaltick
Motion the Mouths of the Lacteals being open, 
is propell'd the same way, and by the same assi- 
stance; but when the Lacteals are open'd into the 
Cavity of the Intestines by an oblique way, as ma- 
ny affirm, and the Mouths are small, the fluider 
Part only, separated from the grosser and more 
ramous, will enter. Whence we may conceive, 
why Men are not hurt with that variety of acrid, 
hard and sharp things which they eat, but remain 
healthful notwithstanding; let us compare the Stru- 
cture of the Oesophagus, the Stomach and Guts, and 
we shall see they differ widely from the Structure of 
the rest of the Viscera. 

The Causes which derive the Chyle into the La- 
cteals remaining, they are impell'd again a-fresh, 
and so promote the former, that it may flow by 
the Vessels situated betwixt the Duplicature of the 
Meseraicks, it is coerced by the semilunar Valves of 
Nuck, and the Flux carried towards the Loins. The 
Lactals arise from the smallest Beginnings in the hu- 
man Mesentery, most of the lesser concurring at acute 
Angles, create a larger Stream, then again recede 
mutually from each other, and after that making an 
Island unite in one Canal, which is divided as the 
rest, that hence they may form larger Trunks, which 
are every where supply'd with many Valves, 
hence the Mixture, Fluidity and Attenuation is 
increas'd: So far they are call'd Lacteals of the first 
kind. 

|P_35
[}The Action of the Meseraick Glands. }]
HEnce in a right, oblique, cross or divided way, 
they tend to NucksGlandulæ vagæ, interspers'd 
thro' the Mesentery, running from whence, they en- 
ter, clothe, and surround or bind them in, but go- 
ing out again they are less branch'd, being turgid 
with the more fluid and aqueous Chyle, and distin- 
guish'd by many Valves, and then they run to the 
Cistern seated on the Loins, and these obtain the 
Name of Lacteals of the second kind. From this it 
is evident, that the Chyle cannot be any ways se- 
cern'd, at these Glands, but seems to be there tem- 
per'd, or allayed; which is the more apparent, if we 
suppose with Nuck, that these cavernous Glands are 
water'd from many Arteries and Nerves, and that 
they admit the Lympha of the several Viscera in the 
Abdomen, which entring there, dilute the Humors 
the more: Therefore being stopt upon that part, 
there is made a Conquassation, Dilution, and per- 
haps a Mixture of the Spirits from the Nerves; from 
whence the Lacteal Vessels being more united, tend 
to Nucks Cistern of the Chyle, often to that, call'd by 
Cowper Trilocular, and hereby the most copious 
Lympha, saith Nuck, evacuates it self of almost all 
the Parts, seated under the Diaphragm, from whence 
being brought by the Lymphaticks , it is thrown 
into this common Channel: For the Valves, Liga- 
tures and Lymphatick Diseases instruct us, that there 
is such a Course or Circuit of this Fluid, which 
abounding with water Spirits and subtle Salt, is the 
most pure Part of the Blood, as its Office, excretory 
Ducts, and sensible Functions demonstrate.

[}The Action of the Chyliferous Duct upon the 
Chyle. }]
THE Chyle being thus diluted by the Cisterns 
plac'd under the Diaphragm, from the Causes 
already describ'd, chiefly by the Force of the Sep- 
tum Medium, and the Pulse of the descending Trunk 
of the Aorta, it is thrown into Pequet's Thoracick
Duct, furnish'd on all sides with Valves, from hence 
into the left Subclavian just thereabouts, where the 
Jugular opens into it, bound or directed by the help 
and assistance of the semilunar Valve of Lower, scarce- 
ly admitting the Chyle into the Vein, but none at all 
into the Thoracick Duct; the whole Lympha flows to- 
gether almost from every part of the Thorax, whence 
it comes that that great plenty of Chyle and Lympha
ascends so easily in Man who is erect, by so small 
or slender a Pipe, that is convey'd with Winding 
or Turnings, which will more plainly appear if we 
consider. First, The contractile Spring or Strength 
of the Intestines, and the assisting Force that drives 
the Chyle from them. 2ly, The Aptness of the La- 
cteal Valves, the Cistern and Pequet's Duct, that ex- 
pedites the Motion with wonderful Efficacy. 3dly, 
The Pulse of the Meseraick Arteries which strike the 
Lacteals in Parallels. 4ly, the great Strength of the 
Diaphragm upon the Channel. 5ly, the Pressure of 
the Peritonæum, which from powerful Causes acts 
upon the thin Meseraick Membrane. 6ly, The 
proper contractile Form of the Sides of the Ves- 
sels, that compose Pequet's Duct, which is very strong 
even after Death. 7ly, The strong Pulsations of 
the Aorta it self, so near to the Thoracick Duct. 

We must therefore observe those things which 
happen to the Chyle in the middle way betwixt the 
Intestines and the Veins; which we shall divide into 
Four. First, The slow Motion by the Intestines, La- 
|P_37
cteals and Glands, which the Laxness and Length of 
the first, the Number and Smallness of the latter 
evince: The End of all these is refining or purify- 
ing the Fluids. 2ly, The external Motion impress'd 
upon the Fluid from the Vessels, the Effect of which 
is Propulsion, Mixtion, Attenuation and Conserva- 
tion of the Fluid. Hence we are taught to con- 
template the Position of the Lacteal Vessels, en- 
creasing by degrees, and supply'd every where with 
Valves, mutually agreeing with each other, that is 
going backwards and forwards, and at last uniting: 
In the next place, the strong Action of the Septum, 
on the Abdominal Muscles, and the Compression 
of the Viscera into the Lacteal Tubes, cleaving al- 
most to the Superficies of the Mesentery, and lying as 
it were naked or expos'd; supplying a proper Heat 
in degree and moisture; the effects of which are 
known and observ'd by the Chymists: Lastly, The 
Pulsation of the Mesenterick Arteries, and the Aorta, 
being strongly united on all sides to the Canals, so 
that by their own motion they agitate them. 

Thirdly, To make an Allay or Temperament, by 
the Mixture of almost all the Lympha of the Body, 
the Reception of a Chyliferous humid Vapour, that 
is in the first place suck'd in to these Lymphatick 
Vessels; and perhaps by the Admission of Spirits 
every-where to the conglobate Glands of the Lym- 
pha thro' the Nerves, and with that thrown into the 
Chyle. 

Fourthly, To its Analogy with all the Parts of 
the Body, before it enters into the Blood Vessels; 
whilst it passes from the Mouth to the Subclavian, 
there is perpetually, gently, successively, and by 
degrees added something of almost every Humor 
of the Body that is elaborated, digested, frequently 
carried round and transacted throughout all the 
Vessels, as the Saliva, Mucus, Lympha and the Mucus of 
Gullet, Stomach and Intestines, the Pancreatick Sa- 
|P_38
liva, the Cystick and Hepatick Bile, and perhaps 
that of the Spirits from some of the minutest Parts 
of the Body; then at last this is accurately mix'd 
by the Strength of the whole Fabrick, the Figure, 
Situation and Motion of the Vessels. 

Whosoever weighs these things will find the Prin- 
ciples of which the Blood is composed, to be lodg'd 
in the Chyle, while he may perceive Water, Spirit, 
Oil and Salts mix'd together; neither let any one 
wonder at the reason why Diseases are so rare in 
the Mesentery, tho' that be seated so near to the Crude 
or undigested Fluid? For he may observe on all 
sides Provision solicitously bestow'd: The Lacteals 
and the Thoracick Duct are equally assisted for con- 
veying the Lympha by the Spirits, as well as they 
serve for the Motion of the Chyle; but he that 
would know the Circuit and Change or Altera- 
tion of the Chyle cast into the Veins, and how it is 
mix'd with the Blood, must necessarily enquire into, 
and find out the progressive Motion and Efficacy of 
that Fluid, which we shall pursue in this following 
Method.
