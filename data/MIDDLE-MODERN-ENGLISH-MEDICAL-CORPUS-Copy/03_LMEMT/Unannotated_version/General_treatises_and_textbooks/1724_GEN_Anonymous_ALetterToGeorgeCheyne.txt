Sir, 

IF any Thing in this 
World, be worthy of 
a wise Man's Care, 
it is Health; and as 
Mankind, cannot suf- 
ficiently testify their Gratitude to 
those, who labour in the Practice 
|P_2
of healing Diseases, with Diligence, 
Candour, and Judgment; so on 
the other hand, they cannot enough 
detest those who set up for the Art 
of Healing, without any other Qua- 
lification, but their Diploma, to Re- 
commend them; and having nothing 
in their view, but making or mend- 
ing their Fortunes, neglect that 
Knowledge, which is absolutely ne- 
cessary, to make their Practice Ho- 
nourable and Successful. 

They who write Well and Ill, 
on the Subject of Health, ought in 
like-manner, to be set in oppostion 
to one another, and as their Labours 
tend to the Preservation or Preju- 
dice of Health, so ought they to 
become the Objects of our Favour, 
or Contempt. 

As all Mankind, are more or less 
frail, they therefore ought to bear a 
great deal from one anothers Folly; 
and the trade of Scribling, among the 
rest of Men's folly's, may be so far 
indulged, as not to be censured, so 
|P_3
long as it continues harmeless and 
innocent; but as soon as it ceases 
to be so, it is every reasonable Man's 
duty, to endeavour to stop its tor- 
rent, and divert as much as possibly 
he can, the Mischief it threatens. 

If a Man imagines he can oblige 
the World, by communicating some 
thing useful; as he ought by no 
means to suppress it, so what he 
advances, ought to be attended with 
the Reasons that led him into his 
Opinion; and these shou'd be of- 
fered to the Consideration of such 
only, whose application in that way 
to which they tend, hath made them 
Judges of their Sufficiency; and then 
if his Arguments shou'd prove too 
weak, to support his Oppinion, no 
other harm will ensue, but his Loss 
of Labour, and that share of Praise, 
which probably he might expect as 
the Reward of it. 

But when a Physician shall pre- 
sume, to lay down Practical Rules, 
to all Mankind without Distinction, 
|P_4
for the Preservation of Health; and if 
these Rules shou'd prove pernicious 
and destructive to it, People will be 
apt to imagine, that he puts himself 
upon a Level with these Savages
on the Sea-coast, who set out false 
Lights, to invite distressed Mariners
to their destruction; that they may 
reap the Benefit of the Ship-wreck. 

You best know Sir, what were 
the Motives, that prompted you to 
publish your Essay of Health and 
long Life, as you call it; but I 
doubt, many will have Reason to 
wish it had never appear'd; it is 
now almost in every bodys hand, 
and that seeming self-deniedness in 
your Preface, that Air of Piety that 
you put on, in almost every other 
Period, will perswade many to be- 
lieve, so good a Man, wou'd never 
publish a Book to pamper his Vani- 
ty, and wou'd never pretend to the 
Knowledge of any thing he was an 
absolute Stranger to; these Con- 
siderations, will, I am affraid weigh 
with many to their Distruction. 

|P_5
I intend by this to show, that e- 
very Attempt of this kind must be 
fruitless, if not pernicious, by en- 
couraging People to tamper with 
their Constitutions, which they 
cannot possibly regulate by any 
General Rules. And if your Per- 
formance proves, that your know- 
ledge of the Animal Oeconomy, is not 
quite so extensive as perhaps it ought 
to be; you must not take it amiss 
if I point out a few of those Pas- 
sages, from whence that unhappy 
Conclusion naturaly flows. If the 
Reasons I shall offer to this purpose, 
are not sufficient to make it appear, 
they cannot hurt you; but on the 
Contrary, if they happen to be just 
and convincing, no good Man will 
blame me for undeceiving People, 
in what regards a thing, so essential 
to their Well-being as Health. 

I have no Inclination to trace you 
thro' every thing that I think wrong 
in this Performance, because, beside 
the irksome Employment of finding 
|P_6
fault, that wou'd oblige me to write 
a Book at least as large as yours. I 
shall endeavour therefore, to be as 
short as the Subject will allow me. 

It is a common Saying, as you 
observe, that a Man past Forty, is 
either a Fool, or a Physician; and 
if it means any thing, it only im- 
plys, that by so long experience, a 
Man that is not a Fool, will know 
what things have best agreed with 
him; and his Reason will direct him 
to continue the Use of them, till 
some alteration in his Constitution 
makes them hurtful; and when that 
happens, he will find there is some- 
thing else required to make a Man 
a Physician, besides living forty 
Years in the World; for beside 
Diseases, old Age will alter a Man's 
Constitution, and bring on Symp- 
toms, which he could have no expe- 
rience of, when less advanced in 
Years. Of what use then, can his 
former Experience be to him, in Cir- 
cumstances he never was in before? 

|P_7
But let us suppose , that by forty 
Years Experience, a Man may have 
discover'd the proper Method he 
shou'd follow, through all the dif- 
ferent Stages and Accidents of Life, 
to preserve his Health, and prolong 
his Days; yet this Method will only 
be applicable to himself, and such 
Constitutions as exactly resemble his 
own, in every Circumstance; and 
such another, perhaps will not be to 
be found among all the rest of Man- 
kind. 

You tell us [/1./]The Reflection 
is not more common than just, 
that he who lives Physicaly lives 
Miserably, the truth is too great 
a nicety and exactness about e- 
very minute Circumstance that 
may impare our Health, is such 
a Yoke and Slavery, as no Man 
of a free and generous Spirit 
wou'd submit to; 'tis as the Poet
expresses it, to dye for fear of 
dying. 

|P_8
If this had been the Effect of any 
previous Reflection, or if you had 
believ'd it, Charity inclines me to 
think, that you wou'd not have been 
so industrious to contradict it, as 
appears from your subsequent Rules 
of Health; (as you are pleased to call 
them,) but have left Mankind to 
act for the Benefit of their Health, 
as Reason and Experience should 
dictate to them; and when they are 
Indispos'd, to call in those Aids that 
are proper to give them Relief; I 
mean such Physicians, whose Skill 
in the Animal Oeconomy, and the Ma- 
teria Medica, hath render'd them 
capable to judge of the Nature of a 
Distemper, and to apply the pro- 
per Means to remove it. I am sure 
every reasonable Man is a better 
Judge of what he ought to do, for 
the Benefit of his Health, than any 
Physician can be, who is not inti- 
mately acquainted with all the Cir- 
cumstances of his Constitution. 

|P_9
When a Man has acquired a com- 
petent Knowledge of the Animal Oe- 
conomy, and of the Power and Effi- 
cacy of these Medicines, proper to 
restore and preserve Health, to such 
a Man, I believe it is possible to lay 
down such general Rules, and Di- 
rections, as may enable him to prac- 
tice the Art of healing, with success 
and ease. 

But to pretend to direct Men ig- 
norant of these things, how to go- 
vern themselves, to preserve or re- 
store their Health, is equally reaso- 
nable, as if one should give Direct- 
ions to a blind Man, to go a long 
Journey by himself, thro' ways that 
he never cou'd possibly have any 
Idea of, and where every step out 
of the way wou'd endanger if not 
destroy his Life. For how shall Men 
be able to adjust either the Kind or 
Quantity of Diet or Medicine, that 
may be necessary, toConstitutions 
they are Strangers to? How shall they 
be able to judge for themselves, of 
|P_10
that Exercise, and Air, that is proper 
for them, when they are unacquaint- 
ed with the Nature of those Symp- 
toms, that can only enable them to 
distinguish. 

You will perhaps say, that you 
have acquainted them with these 
Symptoms to which your Directions 
are suitable; but may not a Person 
be afflicted with any Symptoms you 
can mention, and at the same time 
have others, which wou'd make the 
Method that might be proper to re- 
move such Symptoms, were they 
alone, destructive to the Patient, 
now they are complicated with o- 
thers, which you cou'd not possibly 
foresee. 

What then must become of that 
Person, who having these Symp- 
toms you mention, follows your 
Advice, and whose want of Know- 
ledge will make him disregard those 
other Symptoms that will make your 
prescription pernicious? 

|P_11
Many Attempts have been made 
to lay down general Rules, for 
Mankind without distinction, to pre- 
serve their Health and prolong their 
Lives; but these Productions never 
obtain'd the End they aim'd at; be- 
cause the Constitutions and Habits 
of Mens bodies differ so much from 
one another, that any general Rule 
laid down to any number of Men 
for this Purpose, must be destruct- 
ive, at least to the greatest Part of 
them, if they all comply with it. 

For if every Man, was exactly to 
pursue that method to Health and 
long Life, that is proper for him to 
follow, perhaps we should not find 
two in ten thousand, exactly pursu- 
ing the same Course, though their 
End wou'd be all the same; so that 
any general Rule enioyn'd to these 
ten thousand, wou'd but at best be 
useful to two, and hurtful or de- 
structive to all the rest. 

It very rarely, or never happens, 
that Diseases, even of the same De- 
|P_12
nomination, ever affected two Per- 
sons, in the same manner, in every 
Symptom, and the Method of Cure 
ought always to vary with the Symp- 
toms. How then can you tell a Man, 
after what manner he shou'd govern 
himself in a Disorder, when you 
cannot possibly know, in what man- 
ner he is to be affected with it? Or 
tell how a Constitution shou'd be 
beregulated, which you are altoge- 
ther a Stranger to? And these va- 
letudinary crazy Constutions, that 
you address your self to, actually 
labour under Distempers, or they 
wou'd not be so; and perhaps there 
are not two such in all England, 
whose Complaints, and Constitu- 
tions don't differ in many Circum- 
stances. 

So infinite is the variety of Dis- 
eases and Constitutions, that the 
best Physician in the World, can 
only determine, for these he is inti- 
mately acquainted with, and whose 
Symptoms he himself hath examin'd, 
|P_13
and cannot with any safety, de- 
pend upon any thing , but the con- 
viction of his own Senses, to regu- 
late his Practice by. 

What then must the Complexion 
of your Merit be, who pretending 
to point out the way to Health and 
long Life, lay down Rules for Man- 
kind to follow, which perhaps will 
never be useful to any, and may be 
hurtful and destructive to all, who 
regard your Advice? and the great- 
er your Reputation as a Physician, 
the worse will be the Consequences, 
and consequently the greater your 
Guilt. 

Your Rules for Health, are all 
of them, either such as have been 
known to all Mankind, since the 
World began; or mistaken Notions, 
founded upon no Principles that 
ever reason dictated. 

When, or by whom was it ever 
denied, or even so much as doubted 
by the Thinking-Part of Mankind, 
(and you tell us, you dont write 
|P_14
to the Insensible) that Eating and 
Drinking to excess, were destruct- 
ive to Health; but then it must be 
own'd, that no Body before you, 
ever presumed to determine the 
Quantity of Meat and Drink, that 
a Man should take, and prescribed 
that quantity to every Body, with- 
out distinction; this is indeed in- 
tirely New, and I hope in Charity 
to the rest of Mankind, that you 
are the only Man in being, capable 
of laying down such a Rule. 

That a very great regard ought 
to be had to the Constitution of the 
Air, to restore and preserve Health, 
is a greater Truth than you seem to 
be aware of; but then, it is as true, 
that no one Constitution of Air, will 
agree with every habit of Body; 
and a Physician must be intimately 
acquainted with a Man's Constitu- 
tion, before he can prescribe a pro- 
per Temperament of Air for him to 
live in. 

|P_15
You affirm [/2./]That you have 
constantly observed good Effects 
from leaving off suddenly great 
quantities of Wine and Flesh- 
meats too, by those long accust- 
omed to both . I will not here 
dispute what you say is Fact; but 
I shall beg leave to enquire a little 
into the Arguments you give us, 
to support the Reasonableness of 
this Affertion. 

You tell us [/3./]That nothing is more 
rediculous than the common Plea 
for continuing in drinking on large 
quantities of spirituous Liquours, 
viz. Because they have been ac- 
custom'd so to do, and they think 
it dangerous to leave it off of a 
sudden, it were as reasonable for 
him that is fallen into the Fire 
or Water to lie there, because 
of the Danger of removing him 
suddenly . But this Argument 
of yours is to no Purpose, unless 
you can prove, that a Perseverance, 
in that Life a Man has been accust- 
|P_16
omed to, will as suddenly destroy 
his Life, as lying in the Fire or Wa- 
ter will; and your other Argument 
is, [/4./]That no man was ever a- 
fraid to forbear strong Liquours 
in an acute Distemper, what 
quantity soever he might have 
drank in his Health. 

Here Sir, you must give me leave 
to inform you, that Diseases and 
Health, are Circumstances, directly 
opposite to one another, and what 
may be proper and fit to be done in 
the one, may by no means be safe, 
or convenient in the other. 

e. g. In a continued Fever, where 
Obstructions prevail in most of the 
Capillary Vessels, and the usual dis- 
charges from the body, by insensi- 
ble Perspiration, &c Being Ob- 
structed, the larger and passable Ves- 
sels, to which the circulating Fluid 
is confin'd, are for that reason over- 
charg'd, and to give a Person in this 
Case, even that kind, and quantity 
of meat and drink, that wou'd be 
|P_17
neccessary in a state of Health to pre- 
serve it wou'd increase the Distem- 
per, by increasing the quantity of 
Fluid, in the passable or pervious 
Vessels. 

In all these we call acute Cases, 
the circulating Fluid is not only con- 
fined to a smaller number of Vessels, 
but there being a Check put to the 
usual Expence and Discharge from 
it, by the several Emunctories of the 
Body, which made the former sup- 
ply from eating and drinking in a 
State of Health useful: Temperance
therefore, whatever hath been a Man's 
way of living, is not only safe, but 
absolutely necessary, till these Ob- 
structions which are the Disease, be 
removed; and the several Excretory's
are again qualified, to throw off the 
Superfluities, from the Mass of Blood. 
Care must likewise be taken in these 
Cases, to dilute the Blood, and re- 
lax the Fibres; and these Medicines 
which can effect this, will dissolve 
the Union of the combin'd Particles, 
|P_18
that obstructed the Capillary's, and 
stood in the Way of the circulating 
Fluid, or Extra-corporeal Secretions. 

But if these diluteing Medicines, 
which are convenient in this Case, 
were given to one, where the Quan- 
tity of Secretions, are to the Quan- 
tity of Fluid in the Body, in that 
just Proportion, that is necessary to 
Health; they wou'd increase the 
Secretions, destroy that necessary 
Proportion, and beget Diseases. 

And if a Man in a good State of 
Health, who has accustom'd himself 
to eat and drink plentifully, shou'd 
suddenly leave of that Method, and 
betake himself to a spare Diet all at 
once; the Excretory's which throw 
of the Extra-corporeal Secretions, 
being large enough to carry off the 
Refuse of his Extravagance, would 
upon so sudden a Change, throw 
off more than such an abstenious-diet 
cou'd spare, and leave too little in 
the Vessels, to support the Circula- 
tion, with that velocity that is neces- 
|P_19
sary to Health, for that the Blood may 
be propelled with that degree of ve- 
locity, that is necessary to preserve 
Health, the Vessels must all be fill'd 
in such a manner, as the Impulse of 
the Fluid, and the Re-action of the 
Vessels, may be adjusted to this ne- 
cessary velocity; more or less will 
beget a Disease: And the Blood- 
vessels, &c. Being suddenly drain'd, 
and depriv'd of their usual supply, 
the pressure of the Fluid agaist them 
will decrease with the Quantity of 
it; and the Impulse of the Fluid, 
and the Re-action of the Vessels be- 
ing equal, such a Diminution, from 
a Constitution that is not labouring 
under an acute Distemper, must ne- 
cessarily lessen the Velocity of the 
Fluid proportionaly. 

Hence it is evident, that the sud- 
den Change which you recommend, 
wou'd make such a Disproportion 
between the Quantity of Fluid, and 
the Dimensions of the Vessels, as 
wou'd render the Circulation very 
|P_20
languid; and this slow motion of 
the Fluid, wou'd give its Parts an 
Opportunity of combineing, and for- 
ming Bodies too gross, to pass thro' 
the more minute Capillary's, and the 
Obstructions that wou'd ensue from 
thence, wou'd consequently be the 
Fountain of many grievous Distem- 
pers. The ill Consequences of such 
sudden Changes, have been taken 
Notice of, by every Judicious Ob- 
server in Physick, since Hippocrates; 
and as many of them, as have wrote 
upon this Subject, have faithfully 
caution'd Mankind against them. 

I have already given my Reasons, 
why I think it dangerous to pre- 
scribe either Diet, or Medicine at 
random. And now give me leave 
to point at some things, which ap- 
pear to me in a very odd Light. In 
the Directions you have given to re- 
gulate the quantity of Food. 

You observe [/5./]"Since our Ap- 
"petites are deceitful, and Weight 
"and Measure troublesome and 
|P_21
"Singular; we must have recourse 
"to a Rule independent of onr Sen- 
"sations, &c. You propose here, 
to give us a Rule for measuring the 
Quantity of our Food, independent 
of our Sensations; and if this has 
any meaning at all, it must be di- 
recting us, to eat and drink by guess, 
without any regard to the Quantity; 
for we cannot possibly form a Judg- 
ment of any thing, without the 
Assistance of our Senses. But after- 
wards you advise us [/6./]to measure the 
Quantity by our Eye, but then there 
is one of the Sensations employ'd, 
unless you deny Vision to be a Sen- 
sation. Then you go on; [/7./]"Thus, 
"the two Wings of a middling Pullet, 
"or one Wing and both Legs; three 
"Ribs of a middling Neck of Mut- 
"ton; two middling Slices of a Leg 
"or Shoulder of Mutton, somewhat 
"less of Beef may be sufficient, &c". 

Now if it were prudent or reaso- 
nable, to determine the Quantity 
of Meat, that a Man should take, 
|P_22
without being apprised of the Na- 
ture of his Constitution; what can 
any Body make of this Direction? 
As if a middling Slice of Meat, was 
a determined Quantity, which every 
Body knew; however People may 
determine what they themselves call 
a middling Slice, yet I am sure, it 
is impossible for any Body, that has 
not been accustomed to see you eat, 
to tell what you mean by it. 

Every thinking Man, I believe is 
an Enemy to Debauching in strong 
Liquours, but I cannot be of your 
Opinion, when you recommend and 
prefer small Wines to the stronger 
Kind. Indeed if a Man was oblig- 
ed to drink a large Quantity of 
Wine every Day, then small Wines 
should be prefer'd, provided they 
were sound: But as no Man is 
obliged to drink more than he cares 
for, I should prefer a convenient 
Quantity of the more generous sort, 
either by it self, or mix'd with Wa- 
ter; if it was for no other Reason, 
|P_23
but because such Wines, being much 
less Subject to Putrefaction than the 
smaller Kind, People will have a 
much better Chance, for drinking 
that which is Good. For notwith- 
standing the vast Quantity of Wine 
drank in England, very few are 
Judges when it is good of its Kind, 
or otherwise, unless it happen to 
be spoil'd to a very great Degree. 
And you your self confess the good 
Effects of generous Wines and Food, 
not only moderately, but plentifully 
taken: where you say, [/8./]"That 
"those who have drank strong 
"Liquours so plentifully, as to have 
"thereby a strong Circulation and 
"full Perspiration, seldom or never 
"catch Cold. And this is the 
"Reason why rich Foods and gene- 
"rous Wines, moderately used, 
"become so excellent an Antedote 
"in Infectious and Epedemick 
"Distempers, &c". You are so 
far in the Right in my Opinion, in 
imagining that Men are less apt to 
|P_24
receive injuries from the Circumam- 
bient Air, when their Vessels are 
filled by rich Food and generous 
Wines, than diseased People are, 
whose Vessels are lank for want of 
that competent Quantity of Fluid 
necessary to Health. But this truth 
is the Consequence of a Cause, 
quite different from what you ima- 
gine it. You suppose the violence 
with which the matter of Perspira- 
tion flys from the Body (which you 
call a brisk Atmosphere) resists the 
pressure of the Circumambient Air, 
and prevents its having access to the 
Body. Your Words are these, 
speaking of the effects of rich Food 
and generous Wines, you say they 
[/9./]Not only banish Fear and Terror, 
but as they make so full and free a 
stream of Perspiration, and main- 
tain so active and brisk an Atmo- 
sphere, as suffers no noxious steams 
or mixtures, in the Air to come 
within it, but drives and beats off 
the Enemy to a distance; but 
|P_25
Persons of viscous heavy Fluids, of 
poor and sizey Juices, of little or 
no Perspiration, such as generally 
all Studious, Sedentary and sickly 
Persons are, but especially those 
that are subject to Nervous Dis- 
orders, must necessarily suffer 
under these poisonous Mixtures 
in the Air, if they do not cauti- 
ously and carefully fence against 
them, or take not a present Re- 
medy and Antidote when tainted, 
for besides the Air that gets thro' 
the Perspiratory Ducts into our 
Blood, &c.

Doctor James Keill, in his Essays 
upon the Animal Oeconomy, com- 
puted the force of the Heart, equal 
to the Weight of 5 Ounces only; 
and that the velocity of the Blood 
at the Heart, to that in the minute 
Capillary's (and he did not descend 
so far as the Excretory's of insensible 
Perspiration) was as 5.233 to 1. 
And here you suppose, that the mat- 
ter of insensible Perspiration, whose 
|P_26
velocity is the least of any, is upon 
some occasions, propelled with a 
Force, sufficient to repell the Pressure 
of the Atmosphere, upon the Surface 
of a Man's Body, which in a Me- 
dium is computed to be equal to be- 
tween 39.900 and 40.000 Pound. 

I confess Dr. Keill was mistaken 
in this Calculation; for if the force, 
which propells the Animal Fluids, 
was so much inferior to the Pres- 
sure of the Atmosphere, the Circu- 
lation cou'd not be carried on, and 
Consequently no Animal cou'd ex- 
ist in the Air we live in; for that 
Reason, I shall not press this Doct- 
rine as an Argument against you; 
nor is it necessary here, to deter- 
mine, how much you are mistaken in 
the other Extream. 

But the true Cause, why People 
whose Vessels are well filles with 
good Nourishment, from rich Food, 
and generous Wines, are not apt 
to catch Cold, or be tainted with 
infectious Distempers, is because, 
when the Vessels are all thus filled, 
|P_27
the Excretory's, upon the Surface of 
the Body, are charged in proportion, 
and being swell'd with the Matter 
of Perspiration, they press against, 
and shut up these Orrifices, which 
convey the Air, or any thing else 
from the Surface of our Bodies, to 
our Mass of Blood; and when the 
Vessels are not filled as they ought 
to be, from Sickness, or any other 
Cause, the Excretory's of Perspira- 
tion are proportionaly empty, and 
consequently can't press upon these 
Orrifices, but will leave them open 
to receive the Air, or any kind of 
Fluid, that may happen to be ap- 
plied to the Skin of such a Person. 
These Excretory's that emitt the 
Matter of insensible Perspiration, 
can never be the same, which receive 
any thing into the Blood from with- 
out us; because if they are not Ob- 
structed, they are constantly throw- 
ing out the Matter of insensible 
Perspiration, and they cannot pos- 
sibly, give acces to one Fluid from 
|P_28
without, at the same time they are 
discharging another from within; 
and if they are obstucted, they can 
neither do the one nor the other. 

That Fat is harder to digest, than 
the more solid part of Animals, [/10./] is 
a Position you seem to be very cer- 
tain of, and quote SIRIsaac Newton's 
Authority, to support your Opinion; 
and though the Justice which the 
World has done to the Character of 
that great Man, will leave but few 
Dissenters, from any Opinion of his; 
yet since the best may err, and the 
greatest Genious may be sometime 
mistaken, I have ventur'd to think 
differently, and shall give you my 
Reasons why I do so. 

Don't we find, that Fat disolves 
more easily, than any other part of 
of the Animal substance, by all 
the Trials we can make to that pur- 
pose out of the Stomach; what 
then should make it less soluble in 
the Stomach, than any where else? 
And don't we find that a much less 
|P_29
degree of Heat, than is in the Sto- 
mach of any Animal, will disolve it 
infinitely sooner, than any other 
part of the Animal can be dissolved, 
by all the artful Contrivances we 
can think of? So that abstracting 
from the Action of the Stomach, 
the heat alone, wou'd dissolve or di- 
gest it sooner, than any other Sub- 
stance can be. 

And if because of its smoothness, 
as you imagine, it cou'd in some 
measure elude the Action of the 
Stomach, yet its Parts being less 
tenacious, than that of any other 
substance, the less force would be 
sufficient to divide them. But when 
the Stomach is contracted to pro- 
mote digestion, the Contraction be- 
ing equal in every part of it, the 
Matter contain'd in it, cannot pos- 
sibly evade the Pressure, tho it shou'd 
shift its Place. And I am informed 
by Men of great Probity, who tell 
me from their own Experience, that 
the Turtle, which they eat frequently 
|P_30
in the West-Indies, is the fattest of 
all Animals; and that it is the 
wholesomest, and lightest Food in 
the World. 

I can't imagine, why all these 
Invectives against Punch; as Rack- 
Punch is commonly made in Eng- 
land, tho' I believe this Composi- 
tion may not be agreeable to every 
Constitution, yet I imagine by the 
generality of People, it may be 
drank as safely, as an equal quan- 
tity of Wine; for since it contains 
a smaller quantity of Spirits, it will 
consequently be less apt to heat us. 

You say [/11./]"every thing that has 
"passed the Fire, so that it has had 
"due time to divide and penetrate 
"its Parts, as far as it possibly can, 
"retains a Caustick burning quality 
"ever after, &c". This Observa- 
tion holds true, in Bodies which 
have been calcined; but the Fire 
never has that effect upon any mat- 
ter, while its Parts continue defen- 
ded and diluted with water; (and 
|P_31
Water is the Basis of every Liquid, 
expect Oil) this is evident in that 
single Instance of Hartshorn, which 
when calcin'd, is in some degree 
Corrosive, and receives that quality 
from the Fire; but are not the Parts 
of this same Substance, divided and 
seperated by the force of the Fire, 
when it is boil'd in Water to make 
Jelly? And did ever any body ap- 
prehend a Caustick burning quality 
in Hartshorn Jelly? Has not the 
Fire the same access to the Plants, 
from whence, the simple insiped 
Waters of the Shops are distill'd, 
as to Wine, from whence you distill 
Brandy? Does it not seperate their 
Parts in the same manner? And is 
there any thing caustick either in the 
Plants which remain in the Alembick, 
or in the Water drawn from them? 

According to your Notion, it 
would add to the fiery Quality of 
Brandy, or any other Spirit, to boil 
it over a Fire; but make that Ex- 
periment when you will, and you 
|P_32
will find it produce a very contrary 
Effect, tho' you stop it so close that 
nothing can escape, but what pas- 
ses thro' the Pores of the Vessel; 
and tho' the subtile Parts of the Fire, 
may get access thro' the Pores of the 
Vessel, yet it can never affect any 
Particle of Matter contain'd in it so 
as to burn it, as long as there re- 
mains any Water, to dilute and 
defend it. 

That there is Oil in the Compo- 
sition of all inflamable Spirits I own; 
But every body knows, whenever 
Fire gets access to Oil, it sets it in 
a Flame; and if the Parts of the 
Fire, did incorporate with this Oil, 
as you say it does, wou'd it not 
have the same Effect and destroy it? 
This is obvious from your own Ob- 
servation, of the continued Distilla- 
tion of Spirits, they will at last, when 
they come off without any Water 
to defend them, as you say, be re- 
duced into liquid Flames, which will 
of themselves evaporate into visible 
Flames and Fumes. 

|P_33
It is not my business in this Place, 
to write a Disertation upon the Na- 
ture of Fire, and Causticks; it is 
sufficient to show you, (and I think 
it is evident from what I have said,) 
that the Fire contributes nothing to 
Arrack, Brandy, or Rum, &c. but 
as it seperates these Spirits from 
grosser Bodies, from which they are 
drawn, and in which they actually 
existed, before Distillation. 

The Juices of Lemons and Oranges, 
(and we use no other in England, but 
what are brought from Abroad) are 
every Day given with good success, 
by Physicians, who justly deserve 
that Character, to their Patiens, in 
several Cases, in much greater Quan- 
tities, than People, who are not Drun- 
kard's ever taken them in Punch. And 
you own that Sugar and Water are 
no Enemies to our Constitutions. 

You say [/12./]in the West Indies, 
where from the necessity of drink- 
ing much, because of the violence 
of the Heat, and from the want 
|P_34
"of Proper Liquors there, they are 
"forced to drink much Punch, tho' 
"Lemons and Oranges, be in their 
"full Perfection, they are universal- 
"ly afflicted with nervous and mor- 
"tal dry Belly-aches, Palsies, Cramps
"and Convulsions; which cut them 
"off in a few Days, entirely owing 
"to this poisonous Mixture, &c" . 

Now I wou'd fain ask you, if 
all the People in the West-Indies are 
afflicted with this Distemper, and if 
it cuts them off in a few Days, how 
could ever that Place be Inhabited? 
But perhaps you only mean those 
who drink Punch; however that be, 
you are misinformed of the State of 
that Country, for they have plenty of 
Wines, from all the Counries which 
produce it, and Ale and Cyder from 
England; and are under no necessity 
of drinking much Punch, for want of 
other Liquors; Madera Wine and 
Water, is the most agreeable and 
wholesomest drink imaginable, and 
this they have in so great Plenty, 
|P_35
that they make it serve the com- 
mon Purposes of drinking, as we 
do small Beer in England. Nor is 
it to be suppos'd, that a People 
whose Commerce obliges them to 
have Dealings, with every Country 
in Europe, wou'd want any Conveni- 
ency that Europe can afford. 

And I am inform'd by a Gentle- 
man of good Understanding, and 
great Integrity, who lived upwards 
of 30 Years in the West-Indies, and 
but lately came from it; that the 
Disease called the Belly-Ach, 
which is so perculiar to that Country, 
attacks the Women as well as the 
Men; and that the Women there, 
are particularly Remarkable for their 
Temperance, and abstinence from 
strong Liquors; and that many of 
both Sexes, who never tasted Punch, 
or indulg'd in any strong Liquor in 
their Lives, are afflicted with this 
Distemper; if this be true, and I 
have no reason to doubt my Infor- 
mation, then this Distemper must 
|P_36
have some other Source than Punch. 

And if the Bath be the only Cure 
for this Distemper, as you boldly 
affirm it is; how comes it to pass, 
that so many are cured of it in the 
West-Indies? And tho' the meaning 
of your recommending the Bath, 
and of your Encomiums upon the 
Water, and other Conveniencies of 
that Place, upon several Occasions, 
is by no means Mysterious; yet you 
have rashly srain'd that Point too 
far in this Place, and it will never 
contribute to the End for which I 
believe you design'd it; for pro- 
bably you never can have any Pa- 
tients, under these Circumstances, 
but from the West-Indies, who at 
the same time they read your Re- 
commendation of the Bath, to Save 
and Cure them, they will find your 
Mistake, in saying it is the only Re- 
medy; since they all know, that 
many more are cured of if at Home, 
than ever came to the Bath to find 
Relief; and that going to a colder 
|P_37
Climate, never fails to produce a 
Cure of this Distemper, without 
taking any other Remedy. 

And this Disease, is so far from 
always cutting them off in a few 
Days, that they who live soberly 
when they are so afflicted, generally 
recover in a very little Time; and 
it will hold those, who continue the 
excessive use of strong Liquors many 
Months, nay Years, before they are 
either kill'd by it, or cured of it. 
These things, which every Body in 
the West-Indies know to be true, 
will necessarily make them conclude, 
that you know nothing of the Na- 
ture of this Distemper. And if this 
be true, your telling them that the 
Bath is their only Remedy, will 
hardly bring them there to become 
your Patients. 

Besides we cannot suppose, with- 
out reflecting upon the good Sense 
of these People, that they would 
indulge themselves in a Liquor so 
pernicious to them, as you think 
|P_38
Punch is, when they have variety of 
other Liquors, that would answer 
all the Purposes of drinking. 

This Disease that you ascribe to 
Punch, is I am told, the Effect of 
cathing cold in that Country, which 
the sober People carefully guard a- 
gainst; but those who use to intoxi- 
cate themselves with strong Liquors, 
often neglect the proper Means to 
prevent taking cold, by sleeping 
sometimes in the open Air, or not 
takin the proper Care to avoid this 
ill, by Means that are necessary to 
be used within Doors. For tho' a 
Man is less apt to catch cold, when 
his Vessels are all turg'd with the 
Liquor that hath made him drunk; 
yet after some time, when the several 
Emunctory's of the Body, have dis- 
charged the superfluous Fluid from 
the Vessels, they will become more 
lank, and the Pores of the Skin will 
be more open, to admitt any nox- 
ious Steams that may be in the Air, 
than they were before; and there- 
|P_39
fore, a more than common Care, is 
requisite to prevent a Man's taking 
cold in this State. And if a Man 
catches cold there, after being drunk, 
he will be seized with this Distem- 
per, whatever Liquor he debauch'd 
in. Indeed as all the Ingredients of 
Rum-Punch, are the Product of that 
Country, they are consequently to 
be purchas'd very cheap, and for 
this Reason the poorer sort of Peo- 
ple, and the Sailors that go thither 
(who are the Bulk of those who 
delight in drinking to Excess) often 
get the dry Belly-Ach, &c. By 
cathing cold, after being drunk 
with Punch. But since Punch is no 
more accessary to this Distemper, 
than any other strong Liquor, that 
a Man debauches in, and since so- 
ber Persons who never tasted Punch, 
are subject to this Distemper, I 
think it very unreasonable, to attri- 
bute this Mischief wholy to Punch. 

When you wrote your Essay of 
the Gout, &c. You took a Fancy to 
|P_40
say, that the Nerves were solid 
without Cavities; and therefore 
contained no Fluid. This Notion, 
has led you into many extravagant 
Expressions, about the Condition of 
the Nerves; which this last Product- 
ion of yours is crouded with. e g.
What Idea, can be annex'd to that 
Expression (so often used by you) 
of Bracing, and Winding up the 
Nerves? Every one knows how a 
Drum is braced, and how a Fiddle 
string is wound up; but how those 
Operations can be applied to the 
Nerves, in any part of the Animal
Body, is what I am sure no Man can 
imagine. 

In your Treatise of the Gout, &c. 
you have these Words [/13./]"I have a 
"long time suspected the reason- 
"ings of Physicians, and the Ac- 
"counts given by them of the Na- 
"ture of Diseases, that were 
"found on Nervous Juices, and 
"Fluids, their Motion, Nature, 
"and Qualities: And yet it will be 
|P_41
a great Baulk on the Theory of 
Distempers, the boasted Politeness, 
and admired Fineness of the pre- 
sent Age has advanced, should 
there really be no such Fluids in 
Animal Body's" . This, as you ob- 
serve, wou'd have been no small Sur- 
prise to the learned World; and 
I'll tell you anotherthing, (which 
perhaps you do notknow) it wou'd 
have been no small Addition to their 
Surprise, to have found that you 
had made the Discovery. 

Now, tho' the Arguments you 
bring to support your Opinion, that 
the Nerves contain no Fluid, are 
of such a Nature, that it may seem 
trifling to take Notice of them, yet 
I shall be at some Pains with the last 
thing you say in defence of this 
Notion; because I presume you 
brought it thus in the Rear, as 
thinking it the strongest and most 
conducive to your Purpose. The 
Sum of this last Argument is, be- 
cause the Nerves are Cylindrical
|P_42
Tubes, whereas the Arteries and 
Veins, &c. which evidently con- 
tain Fluid are Conical, and Nature 
being uniform in her Operations, 
therefore you conclude, that the 
Nerves contain no Fluid. 

The Arteries by dividing into 
Branches, must grow gradually nar- 
rower, and for that Reason are Con- 
ical; and the Nerves are Cylinders
because they do not communicate 
with one another, but run on in se- 
parate Canal's, from their Origines 
to their Extremities. 

And the Wisdom of our Creator is 
signaly manifested in contriveing the 
Structure of the Nerves, different from 
that of all the other Vessels in the Ani- 
mal Body. For as the Nerves do not 
communicate with one another, but run 
on in seperate Canal's from their O- 
rigins to their Extremities: An im- 
pulse, or addition of Fluid, to any 
Quantity of Nerves, determin'd to 
move a Muscle or Muscles, runs on, 
or is propagated their Extremities, 
|P_43
without communicating their additio- 
nal Fluid, or Impulse, to any of the 
other Nerves; which cou'd not happen, 
if their Structure was like that of the 
Arteries: For if the Nerves that serve 
in bending and extending of a Limb, 
were Branches from a common Trunk 
with which they had a Communication, 
any impulse at the Trunk, would be 
propagated equally to all the Branches, 
the Benders and Extenders. So that 
instead of regular and voluntary Mo- 
tions, we should be Distorted with 
Convulsions. e. g. Suppose a Power 
at A. determining to 
affect C. by means of 
a Fluid contain'd in 
the Vessel A. which 
communicates equal- 
ly with B. as with 
C. Any impulse upon [^An illustration of a tube that forks into two branches at its base. ^]
the Fluid at A. will affect B equally 
with C. without a possibility of deter- 
mining its Momentum, more to the 
one than to the other. 

|P_44
This Demonstration, I have bor- 
rowed from a System of Animal 
Oeconomy, that is not yet published; 
I wish when it is, it may be effectual, 
to put an End to all that unintelli- 
gible Babbling, which hath hitherto 
confounded this useful Knowledge. 

It is no difficult Matter to con- 
ceive, how the Fibres may be con- 
tracted, by increasing the Quantity 
of Fluid in the Vessels which they 
compose. But by what power in 
Nature, [/14./] can the Fibres be drawn in, 
and sink into their own Substance? 
which you say is the Case in Mus- 
cular Motion. You are realy so 
unhappy in all your Expressions, 
that if I was not certain, you live 
by the Trade of Physick, I should 
Imagine you wrote purposely to 
turn it into Redicule. 

this Sir, is a very incredulous 
Age we live in; and these Infidels, 
whom Providence hath favoured 
|P_45
with Knowledge and Understand- 
ing, will never regard an Opinion, 
without good Reasons to support it, 
be it never so boldly Afferted. So 
obstinate are they in their Aversion 
to Folly, that a Man who Speaks 
and Writes without thinking, may 
babble and scribble from his Cradle
to his Grave, without meeting any 
other Recompence, but Redicule for 
his Pains. And by this Means, they 
vainly imagine to restrain the Folly 
of Writing and Speaking at ran- 
dom; I say vainly imagine it, be- 
cause you know it is attempting an 
Impossibility. 

To be humbly Proud is no new 
Character, and yet I believe you 
may justly boast, that no Body ever 
came up to it so fully as you have 
done; a singular Ambition, peculiar 
to your self, hath made you (upon 
some Occasion or other) reject e- 
very Opinion, that has been com- 
monly received in that Way, you 
wou'd fain perswade the World 
|P_46
you was Bred in; yet when Oc- 
casion serves, you can truckle to any 
Opinion that ever was invented in 
that Way. and at the same time 
you are denying and despising the 
most reasonable Notions, of the best 
Physicians, you condescend to ex- 
press your self, in all the unintelli- 
gible Jargon of the Mountebanks
(tho' I presume they are your Aver- 
on, for the same reason that they 
hate one another) and treat us with 
whole Pages of uncouth Words and 
Phrases, with as much meaning, as 
the wandring Orator delivers them 
from the Stage. This Method may 
get you the Applause of the Igno- 
rant, who are always fond of what 
they do not understand; and they 
being the greatest part of Mankind, 
and generally the richest, you may 
advance by it, what the unthinking 
herd of Men, mistake for Interest: 
but sure you can be under no neces- 
sity of stooping such meanness! 
|P_47
tho' Quackery, like Thieving, is not 
always prompted by Necessity. 

Your fondness of Novelty, which 
you have in common with all those, 
who do not know how to judge right- 
ly of things, made you assert (what 
a great Man only suggested, and 
was far from being positive about it) 
that the Nerves were solid, and con- 
tain'd no Fluid. I have already 
taken Notice of your Intention to be 
Witty, upon the refigned modern 
Opinion, as you are pleased to call 
it. And shall not repeat it again. 
But when it is convenient for you, 
to make your favourite [/15./]Bath-Water
do every thing, by ascribing Qualitys 
to it, directly opposite to one ano- 
ther, or which is the same thing 
making it have effects directly con- 
trary; you thought (pardon me if 
I mistake in saying so) that it was 
necessary, to fall in with the very 
Opinion, that you had but a few 
Pages before, condemn'd with the 
greatest Contempt. 

|P_48
And then you say, that the Re- 
laxation of the Muscles in Palsies, 
&c, proceeds from Obstruction in 
the Nerves; for how can the Nerves 
be obstructed if they contain no 
Fluid? 

The desire of Knowledge, is a 
very laudable Quality as any human 
Nature can boast of; But he who en- 
deavours, to grasp at the Knowledge 
of a Thing, beyond the reach of 
his Capacity, and notwithstanding 
this, will pretend to all the Know- 
ledge of it, that a Genious equal to 
the Task, could possibly arrive at; 
is a Character much of a Piece with 
him, who describes foreign Coun- 
tries, and the particular Qualities 
of Great Persons, as if he had been 
most intimately acquainted with 
them, when he never possibly cou'd 
have access to know any thing a- 
bout them, but what publick Fame, 
gave him in common with all Man- 
kind; and all this from the Vanity 
of being thought a Man of Conse- 
|P_49
quence, and not ignorant of what 
any Body would desire to know. 
That there are many such Charact- 
ers in the World, is a melancholy 
Truth beyond Contradiction; and 
the despicable appearance they make 
in Society when detected, is obvi- 
ous to every Man of Sense. 

You prescribe Exercise indefinitely 
to all Mankind, as if rest was never 
necessary, and Exercise never hurt- 
ful. That Exercise is an excellent 
Remedy in some Cases, to restore 
and preserve Health is very true; 
but what Rules have you laid down, 
or could you lay down, to teach all 
Men, what kind and quantity of 
Exercise is proper for them all, un- 
der their several Circumstances to 
to take. And it is impossible, for 
Men Ignorant of the Nature of their 
Constitutions, and of any Bodily 
Distemper, they may happen to la- 
bour under, to judge aptly for 
themselves in this matter. 

|P_50
When you come to mention the 
Use of Opium, you acknowledge, 
that Physicians are the only proper 
Judges, when, and in what Quan- 
tity it is to be exhibited; now as 
one great Effect of this Medicine, is 
to calm and dispose Men to rest, 
which is the Opposite of Exercise; 
does it not follow, that they must 
likewise, be the only Judges of the 
Quantity of Exercise, that Men 
should take? For when it is fit for 
Men to be quiet, then most cer- 
tainly it is fit for them to leave off 
Exercise; and of Consequence, if 
Men who are not Physicians cannot 
Judge for themselves of the one, 
they cannot possibly determine the 
proper Seasons, and Quantity of 
the other. 

In another Place, you seem to 
give your Assent to what I have 
been alledging in plainer Terms, 
where you say, [/16./] from these gene- 
ral Rules, taking in the particular 
Complexions and Habits, &c. Here 
|P_51
you seem to make it necessary, to 
have regard to the particular Cir- 
cumstances of People, in order to 
prescribe justly for them. But who 
are to be the Judges of these parti- 
cular Circumstances? Must these 
essential things be left to the Dis- 
cretion of Men, who cannot possibly 
have any knowledge of them? The 
Practice of Physick Sir, is a sharp 
Edged-Tool, and seldom or never 
fails of having very ill Consequen- 
ces, when put into unskillful Hands. 

To show you how consistant you 
are with your self; in your Essay 
of the Gout, &c. where you treat of 
Bathing, you say [/17./]If People will 
bath indifferantly without Advice, 
without duly preparing their Bodies, 
and cleansing the Alimentary-Passages 
without any distinct knowledge of their 
Case, their Strength, the proper Sea- 
son of Bathing, or the Time they ought 
to stay in at once; there must neces- 
|P_52
sarily happen (as there have hap- 
pen'd) unlucky Accidents, which tend 
to discourage and disgrace bathing in 
General. 

And a little further in the same 
Treatise, you say [/18./]It is impossible 
to lay down a general Rule about the 
Quantity of Bath-Water, which it 
is convenient to drink daily; that be- 
ing to be varied, according to some 
Circumstances of the Patient, and 
the Nature of the Distemper. 

When we consider these Passages, 
together with your Essay of Health, 
we find that at the Bath, People ig- 
norant of Physick, must not pretend 
to act for themselves, and must be 
directed in every step they take, by 
the Advice of a Physician. But 
every where else, your general Rules 
are sufficient to guide them without 
any other Assistance. 

If you had not some private Rea- 
sons to conceal it, it wou'd be some 
satisfaction to know for what reason, 
|P_53
you have excluded the People at the 
Bath from the benefit of your general 
Rules? Is it not as easy to give Di- 
rections for bathing and drinking the 
Bath-water, under Circumstances that 
you are not acquainted with, as to 
direct People any where else in their 
Diet and Medicine, whose Con- 
stitutions you are equally a Stranger 
to? Or wou'd you have us under- 
stand by this, that People had better 
trust to the their own Management, 
than to the Advice of any Physician, 
except just in that Place where Dr. 
Cheyne, is to be consulted with? 

I do not know how you may 
have succeeded in this way, but I 
think you are by far less artful in 
your Addresses to the Publick, than 
[/19./] those you are pleased to call your 
Brethren; for tho' I believe your 
Ends are all the same, yet these 
strenously declare, that the good of 
|P_54
Mankind is their only Aim; while 
you tacitly own that sordid self- 
interest is yours. 

And here (pardon the Compari- 
son) like the Dog in the Fable, you 
drop the Substance to snatch at the 
Shadow; and when you intend to 
make a Monopoly of all the Pract- 
ice in the Kindom to your self, 
you are industrious to lose what 
you have already got; for notwith- 
standing all the fine Things you 
have said of the Bath, who do you 
think will be at the Expence and 
Trouble of going thither, and where, 
to add to that Expence, they must 
fee a Physician, to regulate them, 
according to the various Circum- 
stances of their Constitutions? When 
every where else with the Assistance 
of your Rules only, they can act 
for themselves, without being be- 
holden to any Physician. 

Give me leave to observe by the 
by, that you give a very extraordi- 
nary Latitude in taking Opium; 
|P_55
when you say, [/20./]That they who 
in the Opinion of the World, 
have died of too much Opium, 
cou'd not have liv'd many Days 
without it" : And yet where you 
decry the Excessive use of Drams, 
you tell us, [/21./] they will as certainly 
kill as Laudanum or Arsenick; now 
if Laudanum can certainly kill, how 
are you certain, that no Body was 
ever killed by it, since it is a Drug 
so much in use, and which every 
Man hath access to at his Pleasure? 
A Man that hath murder'd another, 
may as reasonably urge in his de- 
fence, that the Person he destroyed 
cou'd not possibly have lived many 
Days, though he had avoided that 
Fate. 

Your 7th Chap. contains Rea- 
soning of a very extraordinary Na- 
ture: There you are pleased to say 
[/22./]Pain Constricts, Crisps up and 
shortens the Animal Fibres, it acts 
like a Wedge in tearing and 
renking, and dividing, those small 
|P_56
Filaments; it does to them what 
the Points of Salts do to all Ani- 
mal Substances, which are to be 
preserved for Food, viz. hard- 
ens, stiffens, and contracts them. 
The fibres of live Animals being 
Contractile, Tonick, and springy 
when a hard pointed Body enters 
them (which is the Case in all 
bodily Pain) the parts by their 
contractile Nature, fly from, re- 
cede as much as possibly they can 
the wounding Instrument; this 
appears from the large gash of a 
Wound, made across the Fi- 
bres of a Muscle; in the conti- 
nual bending to the other Side, 
when any Part of us is pain'd; in 
the Cramps and Convulsions, 
nay, and sometimes Fevers pro- 
duced by intense acute Pain. 
Pleasure on the contary, relaxes 
the Fibres by a soft and Bland 
(or as the Mathematicians speak) 
a Commensurate and Harmonious 
Touch, it acts on the Fibres as 
|P_57
two unison and concordant Mu- 
sical Instruments act on one an- 
other; and by stroaking, softning, 
and smoothing, comes at last in- 
tirely to relax and unbend them. 
The Parts of the Fibres run after, 
follow, and pursue, and at last 
break their Union in some degree 
to reach such a demulcent touch. 

Wou'd not any one that impli- 
citly believed in you, imagine from 
this passage, that every individual 
Animal Fibre, was a rational Being, 
and had the Power of discerning at 
a distance, what was convenient or 
hurtful to it? Since you say they 
fly from a destructive Object, and 
pursue that from which they can 
receive Benefit. And if your Ar- 
gument of the great Gash in a Mus- 
cle, from the Fibres being cut trans- 
versly, be of any weight, they must 
out-live the Person to whom they 
belong; for the same thing happens 
in the Muscles of a dead Body, a 
considerable Time after Life is ex- 
|P_58
tinguished. This is a Circumstance 
very well known to all those, who 
have studied Anatomy, in that me- 
thod by which the Knowledge of it 
can only be attained. 

When one winds up a Fiddle 
string till it breaks, does not the 
two Ends fly back in the same man- 
ner, as the Fibres of a Muscle when 
cut transversly? Here, contrary to 
your Chimera, the broken Ends of the 
String retreat from one another to- 
wards the destructive Powers that 
divided it.And this will happen 
to every Elastick Fibre, whether you 
cut it, or extend it till it breaks. 

The Muscles in all live Bodies, 
even in what we call their relaxed 
State, are in some measure Inflated, 
and their Fibres endure a proporti- 
onable degree of Tension, for if 
they were not inflated they could 
not be extended, and if they were 
not [/23./] extended they wou'd not be 
|P_59
Elastick, and if they were not Ela- 
stick the cut ends wou'd not recede 
from one another. 

And in Muscular motion, tho' the 
Extremity's of the Muscles are 
brought nearer, yet we will find 
the length of the Fibres increased 
by this Action, if we consider them 
through all the Angles, made by the 
transverse Fibres which bind them 
together. And the Fibres of a Mus- 
cle, being extended in Proportion 
as it is inflated, it is therefore, that 
exquisite pain is felt in violent 
Cramps and Convulsions, &c.

If a Fibre's being made longer, at 
the same time its Extremities are 
brought nearer, shou'd seem a pa- 
radox to you; only consider what 
happens to a Bow-string, when one 
draws it to shoot off an Arrow; in 
this Action, tho' the two Ends of 
the String are brought nearer, yet 
the length of it will be increased, 
in proportion to the resistance of the 
Bow, and the Power which draws 
the String. 

|P_60
What we call (but very impro- 
perly) bodily pain, never happens 
but when the Fibres are extended 
beyond their Natural length; and 
for that reason, an Incision made 
with a blunt Instrument, ragged in 
the Edge, gives more pain, than 
that which is made with one that is 
sharp and smoother; because the 
first draws the Fibres a greater length, 
before it can divide them, than the 
last. And hence it is, that in Am- 
putations they always with a sharp 
Instrument carefully separate the 
Periostium from the Bone, where the 
Saw is to be apply'd, to avoid the 
painful Tension of its Fibres, by 
the Teeth of the Saw. 

And when such Pain is produced 
from an internal Cause, it happens 
from the Obstruction of some part 
of the Animal Fluid, by which 
means the Vessels in that part swell, 
and the Fibres which compose their 
Sides, are stretch'd and in danger 
of being broke, and tore assunder, 
|P_61
in proportion to the increase of the 
obstructed Fluid. And the Intense- 
ness of the Pain increases with the 
Tumor. Are not the Fibres ex- 
tended in the Tumor, while an Ab- 
scess is forming? And in the Case 
of an Exostosis, does not the Tumor 
of the Bone, extend the Fibres of 
the Periostium? Is it not from the 
Tension then, and not from the 
Crisping up of the Fibres, as you 
Term it, that these Diseases cause 
Pain? These things are so well 
known to every one, who deserves 
the Name of a Physician, that I am 
sorry I shou'd have occasion to men- 
tion them to you. 

But you are positive [/24./]"That 
"Pain most certainly crisps up, con- 
"stricts and contracts the Animal 
Fibres" : Now if the Fibres are 
sometimes shortn'd and crisp'd up, 
as you call it, and if it be a Disease, 
then according to you, the Pain 
must precede the Disorder, but how 
pain shou'd exist by it self whithout 
|P_62
a Disease to produce it, is what I 
dare say no body can imagine. 
What is commonly called bodily 
Pain, as I take it, (and I believe I 
speak the sense of every reasonable 
Man) is a disagreeable Sensation, 
arising from some Disorder in the 
Animal Machine; it is often the 
Consequence, but never can be the 
Cause of any Disorder. 

What I have said, I think suffi- 
ciently shows, how far your Know- 
ledge in the Animal Oeconomy ex- 
tends; as to your Skill in Pharmacy, 
every Apothecary that reads the 
Receipt of you Cordial, &c. may 
determine. And that no Man can 
be quallified for a Physician, that is 
ignorant of both or any of these, I 
may venture to affirm, is a Truth 
as evident as any Proposition in 
Euclid. 

Nor have you succeeded better in 
you Philosophical Dissertation upon 
the Passions, you say, [/25./]Passion may 
be denied, the Sentiments pro- 
|P_63
duced on the Soul, by external 
Objects, either Spiritual ones im- 
mediately, or Material ones, by 
the mediation of the Organs of 
the Body. Now how can the 
Soul perceive any thing from out- 
ward Object, without receiving 
some impression from them? And 
how can such impressions get access 
to our Minds, but by the mediation 
and avenues of our Senses? And 
are not all the Organs of our Senses 
bodily Organs? 

You tell us [/26./]The acute Passi- 
ons whether pleasurable or pain- 
ful have much the same effect, 
and work after the same manner, 
as acute Diseases do, they effect 
a brisk and lively Circulation of 
the Fuids, crisp up and constrict 
the Solids for some time. Thus 
sudden gusts of Joy or Grief, 
Pleasure of Pain, stimulate and 
spur the nervous Fibres, and 
Coats of the Animal Tubes; and 
thereby give a celerity and brisker 
|P_64
motion to their included Fluids". 
There is something so extravagantly 
wild in this Notion (tho' you have 
often express'd your self much to 
the same Purpose) that I am truly 
at a loss what Answer to make to 
so odd a proposition viz. that the 
Perceptions and Sensations of the 
Mind fly about the Body in the form 
of a palpable Fluid, which contains 
hard and pointed Bodies; for such 
they must be, to stimulate the Fibres 
in the manner you contend for. 

That a great part of the nervous 
Fluid is govern'd by the affections 
of the Mind, is evident from the 
Bodily motions which depend upon 
the Will. And as the Mind is dif- 
ferently affected, it may no doubt 
restrain or increase the flow of 
this Fluid to the detriment of 
the Animal Oeconomy. But you af- 
firm that these very Sensations and 
Affections of the Mind, which we 
term Pain and Pleasure (not as they 
prevail upon the Mind to act upon 
|P_65
its Organs,) but act as Solids them- 
selves, to Destroy or Preserve us. 
And thus you say the Sensations of 
the Mind create Bodily Pain. 

But all Sensations, whether plea- 
sant or painful, exist no where but 
in the Mind, and however it be 
common to call that disagreeable 
Sensation, which arises from any 
Disorder in the Animal Organs, Bo- 
dily Pain, to distinguish it from o- 
ther painful Affections of the Mind, 
which do not proceed from that 
Cause; yet in Philosophical Reason- 
ing, no Phrase nor Expression, shou'd 
be admitted, that is not strictly a- 
greeable to Truth. And tho' the 
Soul readily perceives, when the Bo- 
dy is either disorder'd, or better dis- 
posed for performing the Functions 
necessary to Life and Health; yet 
the Organs themselves are incapable 
of any Sensation, and consequently 
there is no such thing in Nature as 
Bodily Pain; and therefore that 
Phrase ought never to be used, e- 
|P_66
specially where close Reasoning is 
required. 

But you seem to be of another 
Opinion, and tell us † [/27./]That 
Beauty or Perfection gives plea- 
sure to both Parts of the Com- 
pound . That is to the Mind and 
its Organs; I thought there had not 
been a thinking Man in Being, who 
did not know, that the Organs of the 
Body were composed of meer Matter, 
and consequently incapable of any 
Sensation; and that Knowledge and 
Perception, can only exist in the 
Mind, and is the distinguishing Cha- 
racter of it. 

I have a better Opinion of you, 
than to believe you mean, what I 
think this Passage implys; for since 
Knowledge and Perception, are these 
essential Quallities of the Soul, which 
denote its existence; and since all 
things which are endued with the 
same Properties, must necessarily be 
of the same Species and Nature; 
why shou'd we then believe the Soul 
|P_67
immortal, if these Properties from 
whence we derive our belief of its 
Immortallity, are common to the 
Body which evidently perishes? 
Nor does the Absurdity of this No- 
tion of yours end here, for when 
we consider it, with what you call 
the 4th Prop. of this Dissertation, 
we will find them amount to the 
most hideous Hypothesis that ever 
was imagin'd; equally shocking and 
repugnant to Reason: Your Words 
are these, [/28./]As in Bodies there is 
a Principle of Gravity or Attract- 
ion, whereby, in vacuo, they tend 
to one another, and wou'd unite 
according to certain Laws and Li- 
mitations establish'd by the Author
of Nature: So there is an Analo- 
gous Principle in Spirits, whereby 
they wou'd as certainly, in their 
proper vacuity, be attracted by, 
tend to, and unite with one ano- 
ther; and their first Author, Cen- 
tre, and the Rock out of which 
they were hewn (to use a Scripture 
|P_68
Phrase) as the Planets wou'd to 
one another, and to the Sun. &c. 
Now if the Sun be to the Supreme 
Power, as the Stone is to the Rock 
from whence it is hewn, then the 
Soul must be of the same Nature 
and Species with GOD himself; 
and not only this; but if the Pro- 
perties of the Soul are common to 
the Body (as you have said they are) 
then not only the Soul, but the 
Supreme Power it self, must be of 
the same Nature with the Body, 
which every Days Experience shows 
us, is Finite and Corruptible. But 
as this pretended Reasoning of yours 
cou'd only be the produce of a per- 
plexed imagination, it deserves Pity 
rather than Reprehension; and a 
Man must be divested of all Regard 
to the dignity of Human Nature, to 
be able to read it, without having 
Compassion for the Author. 

[/29./] You desire the Tender and the 
Valetudinary to guard against Pas- 
sion: You may as well propose to 
|P_69
cure a Man of a Fever by bidding 
him be well; for as the Passions of 
the Mind depend upon the Habit 
and Constitution of the Body, a 
Man whose Habit of Body, natura- 
ly produces these Emotions we call 
Passions, can as well hinder his Pulse 
to beat, as suppress them, till that 
Habit which gives them Birth is 
changed: Indeed there may some- 
times such means be used, as will al- 
ter in some measure this untoward 
Habit, and give a Man considerable 
relief, and make him less subject to 
these miserable Disorders; yet there 
being great variety of Causes, which 
produce these Ills upon the Minds
of Men; to prescribe a Method for 
curing this Ill, without knowing 
the true Cause, it will be so far from 
having an equal Chance of bringing 
about the desired Effect, that there 
will be as many Odds against it, for 
making the Case more desperate, 
as there are Causes more that one 
capable of producing the Distemper. 

|P_70
If you or any Body should 
think me too severe, and alledge in 
your behalf, that however faulty 
your Performance may be, yet since 
you did your best, Mankind are still 
oblig'd to you for your Endeavours. 
I wou'd ask you, or any that wou'd 
plead in this manner for you, if you 
were to purchase any thing for your 
conveniency, that you cou'd not be 
a competent Judge of, till you had 
tried it; and if a Person whose In- 
tegrity you depend upon, should 
sell you that which is damaged and 
good for nothing, for the very best 
of its Kind; and suppose the Pre- 
servation or Loss of your Life, or 
Health, depended upon the differ- 
ence; I wou'd, I say, ask how far 
this Man's telling you, it was the best 
he had to dispose of, would serve 
to preserve his Credit with you? 

I would not here be misunder- 
stood, and supposed to write this 
for the Benefit of Physicians, who I 
look upon generally Speaking, to 
|P_71
be the Bane of Mankind. And I 
believe it wou'd be better for the 
World, that the Practice of Physick 
was quite abolished; for tho' many 
wou'd suffer in wanting these helps 
that they might receive from the 
Hands of able Physicians, yet I am 
perswaded their number wou'd be so 
small, in proportion to those who 
are daily tortur'd and murder'd, by 
ignorant Pretenders to that Art, that 
People in general wou'd receive great 
benefit and relief by being freed from 
so great a Curse as Physicians gene- 
rally are, 
I am, 
SIR, &c. 

London, November, 
1724. 

P. S. 
YOU very obligeingly insinuate 
in the Preface to your Essay of 
Health, that this was the last time you 
wou'd trespass upon the Publick in 
this manner; this I thought was very 
kind in you, and I was in Hopes it 
wou'd have attoned for all that was 
|P_72
to follow; but upon reading further, 
I found my self mistaken. And if I 
had any Influence over you, I wou'd 
perswade you once more to appear in 
Print, and acknowledge your Fault for 
this last performance; which is (if 
possible) worse performed, and may 
be of much worse consequence than any 
of your former

You say [/30./]God was forced to 
shorten the Life of Man, to prevent 
the Increase of wickedness, &c. If 
you had been able to prove this, Man- 
kind might have thought Charitably of 
your performance, and believed you in- 
tended a further Reformation, by mak- 
ing their Lives yet Shorter and more 
Miserable; but as the matter now 
stands, I know but one thing you can 
plead for your excuse, which I leave you 
to guess at: And then your Book may 
be of some use, since it contains almost 
in every Page an ample and convince- 
ing Testimony of it.
