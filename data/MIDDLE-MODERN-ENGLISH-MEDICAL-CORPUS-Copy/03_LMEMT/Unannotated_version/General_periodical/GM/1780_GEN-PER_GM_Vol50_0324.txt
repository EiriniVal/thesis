Mr. Urban, 

THE following extraordinary cure 
of a dropsy, if you think worth 
publishing, you may safely give to the 
public as a well-attested fact. 

A foreign Correspondent. 

A few years ago there was at Ko- 
nigsberg a poor woman, between 50 
and 60 years of age, who was afflicted 
with the dropsy to the highest degree, 
and being totally unfit for any kind of 
work, was obliged to beg for her 
bread. In this condition she for a con- 
siderable time daily attended the Ex- 
change, where she received a small 
pittance from the merchants, to whom 
she was by this means well known, 
and consequently her surprising cure 
was conspicuous to all. Her distem- 
per seemed daily to increase, and at 
last, on her disappearing from her usual 
station upon the Exchange, nobody 
doubted but she was dead. However, 
in a few weeks afterwards, some of her 
old benefactors were surprised at see- 
ing her busily employed sweeping the 
steps before a gentleman's door, and 
seemingly in perfect health. On their 
enquiring of her by what means she 
had got the better of such a dreadful 
disease, she related, that, by the advice 
of another woman, she had confined 
herself to a diet of broad beans (called 
in England Windsor beans), boiled in 
water, without salt, butter, or fat of 
any kind; the beans were her only 
food, and the water they were boiled 
in (which was only sufficient to cover 
them) her only drink, for 18 days, at 
the end of which time she began to 
make water in great quantity, which 
continued with short intervals for se- 
veral days, and by degrees she found 
herself perfectly well, without any 
weakness or other ill symptoms re- 
maining.
