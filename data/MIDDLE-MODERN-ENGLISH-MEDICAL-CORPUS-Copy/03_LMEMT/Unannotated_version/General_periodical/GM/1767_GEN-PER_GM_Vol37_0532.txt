Mr. Urban, 

IN your Magazine for last July, an 
anonymous author exclaimed against 
the practice of giving soap lye for the 
gravel and stone, and, instead of it, re- 
commended a medical soap, the com- 
position of which he did not discover; 
I answered this letter in August, and I 
see he has replied in your last, still de- 
crying soap lye, and still recommending 
a concealed nostrum. His reply I think 
must appear evasive to every judicious 
and impartial reader; and as I think 
no man could be prompted by principles 
of benevolence, to decry a medicine, 
which has been fully disclosed, and 
which in many notorious and recent in- 
stances has afforded great relief in a 
most painful and dangerous disorder, 
and at the same time to conceal what he 
would substitute in its stead, I cannot 
but think there is sufficient reason to con- 
clude that this anonymous writer has 
selfish and lucrative views. 

I hope it will not be thought incum- 
bent upon me to continue a dispute with 
an unknown antagonist, I shall there- 
fore only add, that I intend very soon 
to fulfill my engagement to the public, 
by publishing a supplement to my little 
treatise on this subject, in which I hope 
to make it incontestibly appear that soap 
lye, properly administered, has been, and 
therefore may ever be, of great benefit 
in the disorders for which I have recom- 
mended it. 

Bromley, Kent, 
Nov. 17, 1767. 

I am, Sir, 
Your humble Serv. 
Alex. Blackrie.
