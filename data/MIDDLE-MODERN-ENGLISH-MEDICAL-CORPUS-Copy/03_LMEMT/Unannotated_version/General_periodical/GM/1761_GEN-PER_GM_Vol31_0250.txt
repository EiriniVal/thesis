Mr Urban, 

PLease to insert what follows, con- 
cerning a Luxation of the Spine, or, 
as 'tis commonly called, a Broken Back; 
which will oblige, 
Yours, A. B.

This Disease has been sometimes 
held to be incurable, not only by the 
Antient, but by the more expert mo- 
derns Surgeons too; but with how 
little reason, may appear from the fol- 
lowing case, abridged from Bonetus's 
|P_251
Medicina Septentrionalis Collectitia. p. 603. 
Three vertebr√¶ of the loins were dis- 
located, or forced inward, with total 
loss of sense and motion in all the parts 
below. The cure was performed by 
extension, with cloths or swaths under 
the arms and about the thighs; the 
former drawn by men, and the latter 
by a machine in another room, till 
the crackling bones gave notice that 
the extension was enough. The bones 
then being set, and the extension gra- 
dually lessened, the motion of some 
parts returned presently, and of all 
parts, with sense, in due time; and af- 
ter a strengthening plaister. 

'Tis probable, this method may be 
improved by a swathe put under the 
body opposite the luxation, to bring and 
hold together the broken parts in a 
strait line the better. In some cases, 
this operation is most easy; since it 
needs only an even but strong exten- 
sion, whilst the great ligaments and 
muscles will do the rest; and 'tis al- 
ways far better to try a doubtful re- 
medy, when safe, than none, with cer- 
tain death. 

After this was written, much the 
same directions, in the case, were 
found in Dr Shaw's New Practice of 
Physic, p. 701; yet the importance of 
the matter, it was thought, would jus- 
tify the present publication.
