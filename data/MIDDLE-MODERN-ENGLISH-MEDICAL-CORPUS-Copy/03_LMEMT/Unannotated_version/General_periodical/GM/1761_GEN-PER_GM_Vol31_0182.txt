[}To a Lady on her recommending the Pectoral Bal- 
sam of Honey for a Cold. }]
WOuld'st thou, O! loveliest of the lovely 
train!
Heal my disorder'd breast and ease my pain, 
Command no foreign med'cines for my cure, 
'Tis thou, and only thou, canst make it sure. 
The balm of Gilead is no balm to me, 
And Hybla's honey yields no sweets like thee, 
I shall be well, permit me but to sip 
The balmy honey of thy coral lip.
