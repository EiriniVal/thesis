[}An ADDRESS to the GOUT, on its first 
Visit, by a young Country Patient. }]
WElcome!—thou friendly earnest of }
fourscore; 
Promise of wealth—that hast alone the pow'r 
T'attend the rich, unenvied by the poor. 
Thou, that dost Esculapius deride, 
And o'er his gallipots in triumph ride; 
Thou, that art us'd t'attend the Royal throne, 
And underprop the head that bears the crown; 
Thou, that dost oft in Privy-Council wait, 
And guard from drowzy sleep the eyes of state; 
Thou, that upon the Bench art mounted high, 
And warn'st the Judges not to tread awry; 
Thou that dost oft from pamper'd Prelate's toe, 
Emphatically urge the pains below; 
Thou, that art ever half the City's grace, 
And add'st to solemn doodles solemn pace; 
Thou, that art us'd to sit on Lady's knee, 
To feed on jellies, and to drink cold tea; 
Thou, that art ne'er from velvet slippers free; 
Whence comes this unsought honour unto me? 
Whence does this mighty condescension flow, 
To visit my poor Tabernacle?—Oh! 
As Jove vouchsaf'd on Ida's top, 'tis said, 
At poor Philemon's cot to take a bed; 
Bless'd with the spare but hospitable feast, 
Jove bad him ask, and granted his request: 
So do thou grant (for thou'rt of race divine, 
Begot on Venus by the God of Wine) 
My humble suit—and either give me store 
To entertain thee, or ne'er see me more!
