Mr. Urban, 

THE original of the following ode, which 
is inserted among the fragments of the 
Greek-poets, and entitled an Hymn to health, 
is to be found in the 48th number of the 
Rambler.â€”If you think the translation will 
neither disgrace the original, nor your publi- 
cation, you will oblige a constant reader by 
giving it a place in the Gentleman's Maga- 
zine. 

[}ODE to HEALTH. }]
From the Greek in the Rambler. No. 48. 
O Thou! from whose kind bounty flows 
The greatest comfort Heav'n bestows, 
With thee, blest Health! whilst in my veins 
Life's crimson tide its course maintains, 
With thee for ever let me dwell, 
Nor thou disdain my humble cell: 
For if on Wealth we fix our aim, 
Or glory in a Parent's name; 
If high Ambition fire our mind 
With sovereign power to rule mankind; 
Or Love's soft secret joys inspire 
Our tender breasts with warm desire; 
Whate'er delights the Gods bestow 
To soothe the pangs of human woe, 
With thee, blest Health! new pleasures bring, 
And bloom in one continual spring. 
Y.
