Mr Urban, 
Jan. 18, 1755. 

THE course of my reading some time ago, 
having led me to the subject of vegeta- 
ble poisons, and seeing several melancholy 
accounts of their fatal effects, I was indu- 
ced, for my own amusement, to draw up 
such an account of the poisonous plants of 
our own country, as my small collection of 
books would permit: If you think it will 
be acceptable to the publick, and a proper 
subject for your Magazine, I will endea- 
vour to send hereafter what I have col- 
lected upon the subject, if I see the following 
in your next. 
I am, Sir, yours, &c.

[}Classical Distribution. }]
This plant, according to Mr Ray's 
method of classing, belongs to the 5th 
division of [/1./] umbilliferous herbs; that 
is, such as have channelled seeds. Ac- 
cording to Boerhaave's method, it be- 
longs to his Gymnodispermæ Umbilliferæ. 
The Linnæan system makes it under the 
5th division of the Pentandria Digynia, 
containing all such as have two naked 
seeds, with an universal and a partial 
umbil. It belongs to the Umbilliseræ 
Involucro Duplici of Van Royen. 

[}Description. }]
It is described by Hill as follows: The 
root is large, oblong, and white, often 
a foot in length, and of the thickness 
of a moderate parsnip, of a fungous 
substance, and strong smell, but of an 
agreeable taste. The radical leaves are 
very large, a foot and an half long, 
and as much in diameter at the base: 
They are composed of a multitude of 
short serrated broad Pinnæ, of a dark 
green, and bad smell. The stalk is 
round, smooth, joynted, and branched 
at the top: It grows to an inch in dia- 
meter at the base, and to five feet high; 
it is usually variegated in a beautiful 
manner with purple spots on a dark 
green ground: The leaves upon the 
stalks stand single, and are like the ra- 
dical ones, but smaller: The umbels 
stand on the top of the branches; they 
are very large: The flowers are mo- 
derately large, and white. 

There are few people, I imagine, 
who do not know this common plant; 
however, to such as are entire strangers 
to it, the most striking and obvious 
marks, considering it as an umbillife- 
rous herb, are, the largeness of the 
plant, the spotted stalk, the multitude 
of segments, of which the leaves are 
composed, and its disagreeable smell. 

[}Place. }]
It grows plentifully in most parts of 
England, near villages, in uncultivated 
places, about hedges, ditches, and old 
walls, especially in shady places, and 
flowers in June and July. 

[}Observations. }]
We have as early an account of the 
poisonous quality of Hemlock, as the 
times of Theophrastus and Dioscorides; 
and though it be uncertain whether the 
Grecian Hemlock was the species here 
described, yet it is certain the Greeks had 
a poison called Cicuta, which was in use 
at Athens for killing condemned crimi- 
nals. Both Boerhaave[/2./] and Mead[/3./]
suppose that it was with a preparation 
of this plant, compounded, perhaps, 
with other ingredients, that the divine 
Socrates was poisoned. We need not, 
however, recur so far back to prove the 
poisonous effects of this plant. Senner- 
|P_30
tus[/4./] quotes Tragus, Cardanus, Mat- 
thiolus, and Scaliger, to prove its bad 
effects; and our own countryman, Ge- 
rard, mentions its noxious quality. 
The German Ephemerides contain se- 
veral instances of its virulent property. 
Boerhaave[/5./] says, that only the smell 
of the bruised herb caused such a ver- 
tigo in himself, that he could scarcely 
stand; and that they who eat this plant 
not only fall into convulsions, but ge- 
nerally die. Elsewhere [/6./] he tells us 
of eight children who eat Hemlock; 
they were delirious, almost suffocated 
with a quinsy, vomited, and convulsed 
every one of them. He immediately 
gave them Vitriolum Album, after which 
all those who vomited recovered. The 
Philosophical Transactions, No. 473, 
(See also Gent. Mag. for May, 1744) 
inform us, that six Dutch soldiers, quar- 
tered at Waltham-Abbey, gathered some 
of this plant among other herbs, boiled 
and eat it, two of whom died very soon 
after. 

It cannot be amiss to observe once 
for all, that in these melancholy cases 
the first indication of cure is to eject the 
poison by vomit, if possible: If the ef- 
fect of the poison itself is emetic, it is 
to be promoted by plentiful draughts 
of warm milk, with oil of sweet al- 
monds; which at the same time that 
they promote the first intention of eva- 
cuating the poison, tend to answer the 
second, by sheathing the Spiculæ, and 
defending the first passages from the re- 
maining acrimony. Afterwards plen- 
tiful dilution with watery and oily 
drinks, and if the poison has a narcotic 
effect, acidulated liquors will be proper. 
If the poison is newly taken, and does 
not of itself produce vomiting, it should 
be effected, if possible, by giving about 
half a dram of white vitriol, or some 
other speedy emetic, and then proceed 
as above. 

This method, if the poison has not 
reached beyond the Primæ Viæ, or was 
not taken in such an extraordinary 
quantity as to bring on immediate death, 
has frequently saved the patient; but 
when the poison has spread itself thro' 
the whole habit, its effects are various, 
and often very surprising, according to 
the nature of the poison, and the par- 
ticular viscus which is most injured, and 
in this case requires the most skilful 
treatment.
