Mr. Urban, 
Oct. 5. 

HAVING been a sufferer from asca- 
rides above half a century, and 
having taken every reasonable remedy I 
could hear of, from Ã¦throps mineral, 
when an infant, without effect, I can 
give very little comfort to A Medical 
Sufferer, p. 804, except that, as he is 
not an old man, he may, however, ar- 
rive at old age notwithstanding the teaz- 
ing disorder which he labours under. 

Among other things, I recollect to 
have taken great quantities of olive oil, 
spigelia anthelmintica, quicksilver, &c. 
I have put myself under the care of two 
famous regular practitioners, who pro- 
fessed to have certain remedies for the 
worms: and I have consulted the most 
eminent physicians in London and else- 
where; but without success. 

I have long been convinced that no 
remedy whatever, taken in by the 
mouth, can, in such a confirmed case 
as mine, do any thing more than palli- 
ate the disorder, or facilitate the dis- 
charge. For this purpose I take gentle 
doses of rhubarb; and sometimes I take 
two grains of calomel at going to bed, 
and 15 grains of rhubarb in the morn- 
ing. But I am afraid of irritating my 
bowels, which are naturally very irri- 
table. It is, however, necessary to do 
something, because the irritation of 
these little animals is frequently such, at 
bed-time, as to ruin almost the whole 
night's rest. I have sometimes had re- 
course to clysters; but I have not found 
that relief from them which I expected, 
even when a considerable quantity of 
aloes have been injected. I have lately 
been advised to use oil of olives with 
camphor in this way, and in the pro- 
portion of a dram of the latter to two 
ounces of the former; but I have not 
yet given this a trial. 

I am not of the medical profession, as 
your correspondent will probably have 
perceived; but I hope he will accept 
this information, such as it is, from 

A Fellow-sufferer.
