[}Thoughts in Health, }]
WHen sickness shall assail my noblest 
part, 
And rush impetuous on my throbing heart; 
When pain possess'd of ev'ry nerve appears, 
And nought but paleness my fall'n visage 
wears; 
When ev'ry earthly wish shall fade away, 
And death shall chill the stiff'ning coarse to 
clay, 
Do thou, great God! in that surprising hour, 
Sustain my foul by thy almighty power: 
Let faith, let hope, let extasy of love, 
Wing me to reach the blissful scenes above, 
And join the choir where each thy glory 
sings, 
There let me hailâ€”adore thee king of kings.
