Mr. Urban, 
July 20. 

IT cannot be too much recommended 
to the world not to be in a hurry to 
bury their friends and relations. We 
find that by the assiduities of the Hu- 
mane Society many persons, apparently 
dead, have been restored to life. It is 
likewise the opinion of physicians, that 
the functions of life may for a consider- 
able time be suspended. In short, Mr. 
Urban, it is greatly to be feared that 
many unfortunate people have actually 
been buried alive. No man, of the least 
humanity, can think of such a thing 
without the utmost horror. 

I have heard lately of such an un- 
happy and miserable circumstance. I 
do therefore earnestly, by the means of 
your Magazine, intreat my countrymen 
not to bury any grown persons, or chil- 
dren (for, children, particularly, are of- 
ten too hastily sent to the grave) before 
there appears a visible change in their 
bodies. I advise them to desire a phy- 
sician or apothecary to examine them. 
When bodies do evidently begin to 
corrupt, the sooner they are buried the 
better. Dust we are, and unto dust we 
must return. I think Xenophon men- 
tions, in his most ingenious Memoirs of 
Cyrus, that he desired to be buried 
without a coffin, that his body might 
the sooner mingle with the earth, from 
which it was formed. In this state our 
bodies must continue till they are re- 
assumed by our immortal souls, and re- 
main in either endless peace and feli- 
city, or (O dreadful to imagine!) in 
endless torment and punishment. 

As long habits and customs are not 
easily changed, I could heartily wish 
that some humane member of the Bri- 
tish parliament would propose an act, 
prohibiting any body to be buried till a 
visible change and corruption appear. 

Yours, &c.
