[}SICKNESS and RECOVERY. 
(In a Letter to a Friend.) }]
PEnsive, my friend! and with an aching head, 
My nerves relax'd, and all my vigour fled; 
Life's current rush'd tumultuous thro' my veins, 
Like swelling rivers after sudden rains; 
Life hover'd o'er me like a dying flame, 
And scarce my soul sustain'd my tott'ring frame. 
With falt'ring voice, yet undismay'd, I cry'd, 
Hear me, my God! my saviour, judge and guide, 
Me, let thy love, Almighty Sire ! survey, 
Prostrate and passive as unquicken'd clay, 
Should'st thou recall the breath thy bounty lent, 
Thy will be done! thy servant is content; 
Death holds of thee his delegated reign, 
The parting hour O teach me to sustain! 
Confirm my faith, inscribe it on my heart, 
There dwells in man an immaterial part, 
A spirit, not deriv'd from dust below, 
Heav'n-born, to endless happiness or woe; 
To endless happiness or woe consign'd, 
To vice or virtue as the Will inclin'd. 
Be thou a father to my orphan race, 
Save by thy might, and cherish by thy grace; 
Deal ev'ry virtue, early let them see 
That ev'ry blessing is deriv'd from thee; 
"The rest I leave "—Beyond my hopes or pray'r 
Heav'n sends a med'cine, and dispels despair; 
The sov'reign juice the dire disease supprest, 
Restor'd my health, and harmoniz'd my breast; 
Urg'd the low Muse to reassume the lyre, 
And sing the joys that dangers past inspire. 
So long-toss'd mariners, the tempest o'er, 
Enjoy the perils that alarm'd before. 
What now remains—but gratitude and praise, 
Express'd in virtue thro' my future days, 
That no succeeding guilt my actions stain, 
Or tell that heav'n has added life in vain, 
Or make me wish, in some remoter year, 
Death had not spar'd me with a conscience clear. 
Crito.
