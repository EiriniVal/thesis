25. Short animadversions addressed to the re- 
verend author of a late pamphlet intitled, The 
practise of inoculation justified. Proper 
to be read by all who have seen, or may here- 
after see the said pamphlet; and especially by 
such who retain any moral scruples concern- 
ing the disorders of impudence and quack- 
ery. Not published by general or single re- 
quest and not yet the hundredth edition. 
Bladon. 

This pamphlet relates chiefly to a quarrel 
between one Mr. Houlton and one Mr. Pine, 
with which the public has very little con- 
cern.
