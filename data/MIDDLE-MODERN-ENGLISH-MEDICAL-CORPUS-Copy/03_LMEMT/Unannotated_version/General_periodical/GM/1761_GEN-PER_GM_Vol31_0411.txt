Mr Urban, 

I BEG leave to acquaint those who 
are afflicted with the gout, that 
they will find great benefit from is- 
sues. I have always ordered these o- 
penings to be made above the knee, 
immediately above the gartering place, 
which I have found to be a more con- 
venient place for issues than below the 
knee. I am also convinced, from ex- 
perience, that these drains are parti- 
cularly beneficial in preventing the 
gout from affecting the head, breast, 
and stomach; a relief from the appre- 
hension of which is generally very con- 
solatory to every person threatened 
with that disease in those parts. 

I have generally found that one is- 
sue is sufficient to carry off or prevent 
the disease, except the fits are long, 
frequent, and violent; in such cases I 
always desire that two issues may be o- 
pened. 

Though I know of no objections 
which can be made to the opening of 
issues for the gout, yet I advise every 
person to consult the physician who is 
best acquainted with his constitution, 
before he takes this step; perhaps 
some extraordinary circumstance may 
forbid the use of them. 

As I have no other motive in ma- 
king this public but that of the relief 
of the afflicted, I beg the favour of those 
who try this method of cure, to trans- 
mit to me an account of its effects for 
my farther information. 

P. S.  Letters may be directed to Dr 
Turnbull, in Smyrna, to be left at the 
Sword-Blade Coffee-House. Post paid to 
London. 

A. Turnbull.
