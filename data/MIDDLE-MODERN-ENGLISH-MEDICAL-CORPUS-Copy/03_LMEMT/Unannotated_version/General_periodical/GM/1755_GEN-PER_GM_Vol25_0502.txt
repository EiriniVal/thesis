Mr Urban, 

IT has, I think, been generally be- 
lieved by the most eminent natura- 
lists and physicians, that the constitu- 
tion of the air is very instrumental ei- 
ther in promoting or preventing con- 
tagious diseases; and the truth of this 
opinion is greatly confirmed by a cir- 
cumstance which is not generally known, 
and which is not, I believe, mention'd 
by any author who has written on the 
subject. 

The inhabitants of the island of St 
Helena are utterly unacquainted with 
the small-pox, and while they continue 
there appear not to be susceptible of 
the infection. The cloaths of those 
who have had this disease at sea have 
been washed there without any bad 
consequence, though the washing in- 
fected cloaths introduced a very fatal 
kind among the Hottentots, at the cape 
of Good Hope, as Dr Mead has remark- 
ed in his discourse on the small pox: 
But the natives of St Helena are very 
subject to the small-pox upon their re- 
moval to England and other countries; 
and I am informed by a person who 
resided long there, that a ship which 
sailed from thence to Bencoolen with 
the small-pox on board, brought a most 
dangerous infection thither, tho' she 
had left none behind her at St Helena. 
I should be glad to have the opinion 
of some of your correspondents upon 
this subject who have had opportunities 
of farther enquiry, than 

Sir, yours, &c. J. Mâ€”TT.
