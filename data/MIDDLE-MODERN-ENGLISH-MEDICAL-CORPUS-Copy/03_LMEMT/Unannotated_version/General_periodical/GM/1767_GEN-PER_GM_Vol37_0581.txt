Mr. Urban, 

I SENT an account for your Maga- 
zine, three or four years ago, (which 
was accordingly published in it at that 
time) of my being perfectly cured of the 
stone and gravel, by the use of water on- 
ly. I saw the same account reprinted in 
the Magazine for last month, with a 
query, what sort of water I drank, and a 
supposition it might be some mineral. 
Had that been the case, I should certain- 
ly have named the particular water, o- 
therwise I should have defeated the only 
end I had in giving the account at all, 
viz. the public good. But, is what is 
called fair water, either river or spring 
water? What I have constantly used is 
from a well in my cellar, which is sup- 
plied by the rain, filtered through a 
loomy gravel, without any other spring, 
and though the pump is encrusted with 
a sandy contexture, to the thickness of 
near half an inch, yet this water has had 
the effect I mentioned, not only on my- 
self, but a person in my family, who has 
drank it for the same disorder. And I 
do further certify, that ever since the 
time when I first published my case and 
cure, I have been free from all symp- 
toms of that disorder, except a touch at 
the end of a fit of the gout, which is soon 
removed by resuming the use of the wa- 
ter; and am certain that any kind of 
what is called fair water, will have the 
same effect.
