All Sciences a fawning Monsieur knows. 

London a Poem. 

WHen thousands fall in spite of skill, 
What wonder Ignorance should kill? 
Such, noble youth, was thy hard fate, 
Thy life cut short before its date! 
Whose ancestors Britannia's boast, 
In thee a rising hero's lost! 
Resolv'd, the slaught'rer o'er thee stood, 
To have at all events thy blood, 
Thro' thy arterial channels broke, 
And butcher'd with repeated stroke. 
But let this tale [/1./] be never heard; 
Still be the foreign tribe prefer'd, 
Trust them, ye great, their pockets fill, 
They only rob, betray and kill. Tom Telltroth.
