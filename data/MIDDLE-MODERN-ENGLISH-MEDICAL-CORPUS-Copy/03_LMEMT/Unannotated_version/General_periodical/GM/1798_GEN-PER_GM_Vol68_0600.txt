[}162. Dissertation on the Chemical and Medical 
Properties of the Bristol Hot Well Water. 
To which are added, Practical Observations 
on the Prevention and Treatment of Pulmo- 
nary Consumptions. By A. Carrick, M. D. }]
WATERS, so slightly impregnated 
with foreign ingredients, or with such 
common substances, as those of Bristol 
hot wells, are subjects of investigation 
more for their celebrity, as no impor- 
tant deductions can result from suth
enquiries. The present analysis is, 
however, well-conducted. From his 
|P_601
few trials he finds that "a wine gallon, 
of 231 cubic inches, of hot well water 
is impregnated with Muriated magnesia 7¼ grains Muriated soda 4 Vitriolated soda 11¼ Vitriolated lime 11¾ Carbonated lime 13½ —Making altogether of 
solid matter } 47¾ —Carbonic acid gas 30 cubic inches Respirable air 3 —Making altogether of 
gaseous fluids } 33 cubic inches."
After shewing the difference in the 
contents of the hot well water under 
different situations of the tide, Dr. C. 
takes notice of the lately-discovered 
warm spring at Clifton, called the 
Sion-Spring, seeming to contain the 
same kind of ingredients, but in dif- 
ferent proportions 

Consumption being supposed by the 
Doctor always to arise from inflamma- 
tion of the active kind, his remedies 
are of the debilitating kind, and such 
as have been commonly employed with 
this view; but his trials do not appear 
to have been sufficient to form a judge- 
ment of his success in the curative and 
palliative means: and, though his work 
may be considered rather as a guide to 
the wells, it adds little to the stock of 
information respecting the disease.
