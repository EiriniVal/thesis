[}Verses occasion'd by drinking Miss Sk— P—th's 
Health at Astrop Wells; a Peach-stone, 
which she once had in her Mouth, being put 
always into the Glass. }]
WHERE healing springs, near Astrop plac'd, 
Their watry stores supply, 
A Peach-stone yields the wine as fast, 
And fills the glass as high. 
Such magick in that prize is found, 
By bright Maria taught 
To speed the chearful brimmers rounds 
And consecrate the draught. 
Bless'd by those lips, whose touch divine 
Might wasting life repair, 
To Nectar it converts the wine; 
To gladness every care. 
Give me that balm to ease my pain, 
My cordial when I faint: 
And let the relique still remain, 
To witness for the Saint.
