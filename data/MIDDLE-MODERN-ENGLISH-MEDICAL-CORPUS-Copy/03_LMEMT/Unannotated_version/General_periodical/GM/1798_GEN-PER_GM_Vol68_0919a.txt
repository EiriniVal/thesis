Mr. Urban, 
Bath, Nov. 13. 

"Salus populi suprema lex esto. "
[^Decorative frame around the letter "Y". ^]YOUR correspondent 
Humanus p. 823, in 
his animated address to 
the members of the 
College, calling their 
attention to that dread- 
ful pestilence which 
still rages in America [/1./], breathes the 
true spirit of philanthropy. As it con- 
tinues to triumph over all the reme- 
dies that have been tried by the ablest 
of our Transatlantic brethren, it is ho- 
ped they will not disdain to receive in 
good part any friendly hints that may 
be conveyed from this side the water. 
Your well-known Magazine, which 
circulates far and wide through the 
United States, cannot touch on a more 
interesting subject: and who knows, 
Mr. Urban, how soon the dire conta- 
gion (ah! dreadful idea!) may be 
propagated to our own country! 

Though no specific antidote has hi- 
therto been discovered, yet, by the 
united efforts of the faculty, it is to 
be hoped the nature of the disease will 
be elucidated, its treatment improved, 
or, at least, some more successful mode 
of prevention brought to light. The 
ordinary means of prevention, such as 
the wearing of camphor next the skin, 
the smoaking of segars, and various 
aromatics, and the kindling of large 
fires in the streets, are all perfectly 
nugatory; and serve only to amuse 
credulity at the expence of woeful dis- 
appointment. 

The remarkable efficacy of olive-oil 
in the prevention and even cure of the 
Plague (at least in its first stage) in the 
Lazaretto at Smyrna, as described by 
the benevolent Count Berchtold, ought 
surely to excite the attention of the Fa- 
culty [/2./]. What can be more easy or 
innocent than for nurses and attendants 
on the sick to rub the whole body with 
warm olive-oil? 

Its merits or demerits ought cer- 
tainly now to be brought to the test of 
fair and candid experiment. Should it 
prove a preservative of a majority of 
those who are immediately exposed to 
the contagion, happy indeed would be 
the discovery! Should it entirely fail, 
it would, even then, only share the 
fate of all the other methods that have 
been hitherto employed. 

Whatsoever, therefore, may be the 
result of suitable trials of this simple 
remedy against contagion, a candid ac- 
count of its effects in your succeeding 
Numbers, will be anxiously expected, 
I presume, not only by you, Mr. Ur- 
ban, but by evey friend to the cause 
of 
Humanity.

â€  "Del' nuovo Remedio contra la Peste, " &c. The method of using it has been 
also described and illustrated in a remarkable case of petechial fever by Dr. Fothergill, 
in his late preservative plan against sudden and fatal disasters.
