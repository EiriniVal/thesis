[}Address to the Small Pox. Inscrib'd to Miss N. B.}]
SPoiler of beauty! for this once forbear, 
To print thy vengeance on this blooming fair, 
O spare those brilliant eyes, that angel's face, 
Nor heav'n's fair portrait with thy spots disgrace. 
Wisely determin'd to prevent the foe, 
Nor wait unguarded to sustain the blow, 
[/1./] Bravely resolv'd the doubtful war to wage, 
She mocks the fury, and eludes thy rage; 
[/2./] On the fam'd hill again she soon will shine, 
With Juno—Pallas—in the train divine, 
They too, escap'd the danger of thy harms, 
In pristine beauty glow, and wonted charms: 
Thus a slight hurt upon the Trojan plain, 
Venus receiv'd from Diomed—in vain! 
The wound soon clos'd again, no scar remain'd, 
And queen of beauty still the goddess reign'd.
