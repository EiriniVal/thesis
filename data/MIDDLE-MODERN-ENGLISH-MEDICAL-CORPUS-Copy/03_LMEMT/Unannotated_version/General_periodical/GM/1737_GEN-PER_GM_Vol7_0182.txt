[}Thoughts in Health; from the genuine Copy. }]
WHEN sickness shall assail my noblest 
part, 
And rush impetuous on my throbbing heart; 
When pain possess'd of ev'ry nerve appears, 
And livid paleness my fall'n visage wears; 
When ev'ry wish for life shall be deny'd; 
And death in triumph o'er his victim ride: 
Do thou, great God! in that surprising hour, 
Sustain my soul, by thy almighty power; 
Remit my sins, assure me of thy love, 
And let faith wing me to the bliss above. 
There in immortal strains thy praise I'll sing, 
Prostrate adore thee God, and hail thee King! 
Clito.
