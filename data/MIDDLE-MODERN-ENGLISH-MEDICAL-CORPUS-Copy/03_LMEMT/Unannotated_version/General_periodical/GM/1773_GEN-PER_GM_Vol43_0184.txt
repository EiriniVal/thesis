Mr. Urban, 

AS a certain plan, put into execu- 
tion by some Manchester gentle- 
men a few years ago, for the relief and 
|P_185
cure of lunaticks, has been attended 
with very considerable success, and may 
be easily followed with equal advan- 
tage in other parts of the kingdom, it 
will not be foreign I hope to the de- 
sign of your Magazine, to publish 
their grounds and motives for entering 
upon this useful work, and the man- 
ner in which it hath been and is now 
conducted. 

The trustees of the public infirmary 
in Manchester (erected in the year 
1752) found it extremely inconvenient 
to admit poor lunaticks as in-patients, 
and therefore, in conformity with all 
other infirmaries, excluded, by their 
rules, those miserable objects from be- 
ing admitted as in-patients. 

These rules, however, did not deter 
many humane persons from frequently 
solliciting the trustees to take the case 
of poor lunaticks once more under con- 
sideration, with a promise of contri- 
buting very generously towards any ex- 
traordinary expence that might be in- 
curred by admitting them. Thus prest 
upon and encouraged, they could not 
forbear turning their attention this way, 
to which they were farther moved by 
the following considerations: 

In the first place, they apprehended 
that no cases could be more truly de- 
plorable than those of poor lunaticks, 
who had in common no prospect of a 
cure, and who had besides no care or 
attendance upon their persons but what 
a needy parent could bestow, or what 
a thrifty parish-officer could provide, 
at the same time that they continued 
public spectacles of the deepest misery, 
if not of terror, to their neighbours; 
they had moreover in view the assist- 
ance which they might reasonably hope 
to give to many persons of middling 
fortunes, who, labouring under the 
terrible misfortune of an unsound mind, 
had no place to resort to but a private 
madhouse, where their cure stood a 
great chance of being protracted (for 
the benefit of a mercenary keeper), if 
ever to be accomplished, by one who 
could lay so small a claim to medical 
abilities. These persons, or their re- 
lations, they could not doubt would 
gladly give the preference to an asylum
of this kind, conducted by men of 
principle and honour, where the pa- 
tients might expect to meet with the 
most humane and disinterested treat- 
ment; and where, though a moderate 
fee was taken by the trustees for their 
subsistence, and by the physician for 
his advice, they might happily be re- 
stored to their health and friends, with- 
out impairing their fortunes. 

Accordingly, by the benefactions 
which came in, in the year 1765, they 
were enabled to erect and furnish a 
building solely for the use of luna- 
ticks; and likewise to provide a go- 
vernor and governess, with proper ser- 
vants entirely to attend upon them: 
but the money subscribed being little 
more than what was expended in the 
house and furniture, they found them- 
selves obliged to exact a weekly sum 
from the relations of each patient, or 
from their parish officers, for their 
board and maintenance; which, sel- 
dom exceeding five shillings a week 
for paupers, eight or ten shillings for 
those in middling condition, and one 
guinea per week for persons of for- 
tune, was gladly submitted to; and 
has enabled them, by the number of 
patients which have been sent in, 
fully to obtain their desired end, the 
physicians of the Infirmary, and the 
surgeons, when necessary, having ge- 
nerously given their advice and assis- 
tance to the poorer sort gratis. Such, 
indeed, has been their success, that it 
has been found necessary, the last year, 
to add upwards of twenty new cells to 
the twenty-two at first erected. 

The trustees of the Infirmary, and 
all contributors of 50l. or upwards, 
are appointed governors; but the im- 
mediate care and management is com- 
mitted to twenty-one persons, chosen 
out of the trustees of the Infirmary an- 
nually, of which five are a quorum. 

No recommendation is required for 
the admission of any patient into this 
hospital, if a place may be so called, 
where every man pays, in some mea- 
sure, for his subsistence. Two friends 
of the patient, or, if paupers, the over- 
seers of the poor, are only to send a 
petition, duly signed, to the trustees of 
the Infirmary at their weekly board, 
setting forth the age, sex, and condi- 
tion of the patient, and describing the 
case as far as they well can; upon 
which the secretary will return an im- 
mediate answer; and if the patient, 
upon examination of the physician, 
shall be found a proper object, he, or 
she, will be admitted. 

As this hospital is favoured with 
frequent benefactions and legacies, the 
trustees have a prospect of being able, 
in time, to admit the poor gratis. A 
consummation devoutly to be wished. 

Mr.
