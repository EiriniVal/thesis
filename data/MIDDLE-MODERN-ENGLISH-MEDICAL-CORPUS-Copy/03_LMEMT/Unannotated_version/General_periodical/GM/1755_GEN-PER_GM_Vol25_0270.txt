[}Classical Distribution. }]
This plant belongs to the Herbæ bac- 
ciferæ according to the systems of Ray
and Boerhaave; to the Pentandria mo- 
nagynia of Linnæus, among the plants of 
the fourth division, having declinated 
stamina; to the Herbæ Oligantheræ sta- 
minibus pericarpio multi loculari of Van 
Royen. 

[}Description. }]
The root is composed of a number of 
oblong tuberous bodies, of a brown 
colour, succulent, and of a very disa- 
greeable smell. The radical leaves are 
a foot long and five inches broad. The 
stalk rises to three or four feet high, 
and is very much devaricated and 
branched; the leaves stand alternately 
on it, and at small distances; they are 
|P_271
five or six inches long, and more than 
half as much in breadth, of a dusty 
green colour, and a paler green under- 
neath, hairy on both sides, and not si- 
nuated at the edges. The flowers are 
very numerous, they stand in the alæ of 
the leaves, and are large, of a campa- 
nulated figure, and striated, of a dusky 
purple colour within, with a yellow va- 
riegated base: the outer surface is of a 
greenish red and hairy; after the flower 
is fallen there succeeds a fine beautiful 
and large berry, which is black when 
ripe. 

[}Place. }]
It is not very common; it is chiefly 
found growing in uncultivated places, 
in church-yards, about old buildings, 
among rubbish, and about dunghills, 
and sometimes on barren sandy heaths,
It is mentioned in Mr Ray's Synopsis to 
have been found in the church-yard 
and lanes about Fulbourn in Cambridge- 
shire, Sutton-Cofield in Warwickshire; in 
the Downs, where it grows very small; 
in Cuchstone, near Rochester in Kent, all 
the yards and backsides are over-run 
with it. Dr Deering found it upon Clif- 
ton-hill near Nottingham; also in a 
quarry not far from the cold bath at 
Mansfield; in Currenwood Kins near Bur- 
ton in Kendal, and other places in West- 
moreland. Wilson's Synopsis. Dr Wilmer
found it among the bogs goingdown to 
Darking, Surrey, plentifully; in Preston
church-yard, near Feversham, Kent. Mr 
Watson found it by the road side, under 
the park wall, between Temsford mills 
and Welwyn, Hertfordshire. Mr Black- 
stone found it in a shady gravel-pit near 
the old park-wood at Harefield, and in 
the gardens at Moor park near Rick- 
mansworth, plentifully, Specimen Botan. 
p. 93. It hath been found about Grace- 
Dieu abbey in Leicestershire, but sparing- 
ly; also in the church-yard and else- 
where about North Luffenham in Rutland, 
from whence I received a specimen this 
spring by a friend, who was informed, 
that a child some time ago had been 
poisoned at that place by eating the 
berries of the plant. 

[}Observations. }]
We have many fatal instances upon 
record, in various authors, of the in- 
toxicating and poisonous quality of this 
plant; of the berries especially. Such 
indeed as occur have in general hap- 
pened to children, who being allured 
by their beautiful appearance and sweet 
taste, have eaten of them. Almost all 
the antient botanic and medical writers 
have remarked its narcotic and de- 
structive quality. Theophrastus, one of 
the most antient writers extant, upon 
the subject of vegetables, has described 
[/1./] two species of nightshade, to both 
which he ascribes a narcotic quality, 
and of the one particularly observes, 
that if the root be given to the quanti- 
ty of three or four drams it proves fa- 
tal. Dioscorides[/2./] describes four species, 
one of which he calls Στρύχνος μανικος, 
and which by several authors is thought 
to be the very plant we have described, 
but the descriptions of the antients are 
frequently so short, vague, and inde- 
terminate, that it is difficult, not to say 
impossible, at this time, in many in- 
stances, to fix upon the particular spe- 
cies they meant to describe. Dioscori- 
des attributes the same poisonous effects 
to this plant as Theophrastus had done, 
as likewise does Pliny, [/3./] who also 
enumerates four species, and seems 
to have taken his account of the 
plant from Theophrastus or Dioscori- 
des, with very little variation. Later 
authors have more accurately observed 
and recorded its poisonous faculty. 
Matthiolus, an author of great credit, 
informs us from his own knowledge, 
of some children poisoned by eating the 
berries of the plant. Sennertus, [/4./] in 
his account of vegetable poisons, [/5./]
has quoted Tragus for an instance of a 
man, who having eat of its berries 
went mad the next day. From Fusch- 
sius he informs us of two boys who were 
poisoned by the same; and from Lobel's 
Adversaria, that some youths who had 
eaten of them became stupefied, fell 
asleep, and died, as from an over-dose of 
opium. Gerard[/6./] informs us of three 
boys of Wisbick in the isle of Ely, who 
eat the berries of this plant, two 
whereof died in less than eight hours, 
the third, by having honey and wa- 
ter given him, and vomiting often, 
recovered.  Mr Ray, when men- 
tioning the bad quality of this plant, 
says, [/7./]Baccas pueris esitantibus sæpius 
|P_272
mortiferas fuisse legimus et audivimus . 
Boerhaave[/8./] produces instances of se- 
veral children poisoned by the same. 
See also Gent. Mag. for August 1747, an 
account of a child at Cambridge, who 
by eating one berry died in 12 hours 
after. The very next month several 
children at Edinburgh having eaten of 
these berries, swelled and were thrown 
into strong convulsions, and two of 
them died the next day. 

Another remarkable instance of the 
effects of these berries we have in the 
Magazine for Sept. 1748, of a coach- 
man who was killed by eating three or 
four of them, which he gathered in a 
lane near Peterborough. Wepfer also [/9./]
relates the case of a child about ten 
years old, who by eating the berries 
was thrown into a great variety of con- 
vulsive symptoms, but proper care be- 
ing taken, by vomiting and giving a- 
lexipharmics and anti-epileptics, he re- 
covered. Mr Millar has quoted Bucha- 
nan for one of the most remarkable and 
memorable instances of the intoxica- 
ting nature of this plant, in which he 
gives an account of the destruction of 
the army of Sweno, when he invaded 
Scotland, by mixing a quantity of the 
juice of these berries with the drink 
which the Scots, by their truce, were to 
supply them with, which so intoxicated 
the Danes, that the Scots fell upon them 
in their sleep, and killed the greatest 
part of them, so that there were scarcely 
men enough left to carry off their 
king. [/10./]

The leaves and root of this herb 
have been recommended and exter- 
nally used in cataplasms and ointments 
for inflammatory swellings, and in ul- 
cers even of a cancerous nature. But 
even their external use seems not ad- 
viseable, as appears from the following 
remarkable history of the effects of the 
leaves, quoted by Dr Van Swieten, [/11./]
from Mr Ray's history of plants, to con- 
firm his opinion, that some poisons may 
induce palseys, even externally applied. 
The case was this: A lady of quality ap- 
plied a bit of the green leaf to a small 
ulcer which she had near her eye, and 
which was thought to be cancerous. 
This in one night's time so relaxed the 
uvea, that she could not contract the 
sight; the pupil, even in the most gla- 
ring light, appearing more than four 
times larger than that of the other eye, 
but by degrees, the leaf being removed, 
it recovered its former elasticity. And 
that this was not accidental, appears 
from the experiment being repeated 
three times, the same effect constantly 
following. 

To conclude, so many instances of 
the direful effects of this plant natu- 
rally suggest the expediency of endea- 
vouring to destroy it wherever it is 
found, about villages especially, as 
children may easily be tempted to eat 
of the berries from their sweet taste and 
alluring appearance.
