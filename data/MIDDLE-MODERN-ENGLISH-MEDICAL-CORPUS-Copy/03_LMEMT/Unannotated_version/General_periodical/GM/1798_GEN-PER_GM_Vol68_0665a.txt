Mr. Urban, 
Bath, June 12. 

IN answer to a correspondent in 
p. 384, I recollect some account of 
one Oliver, a viper-catcher, in Bath, 
who suffered himself to be bitten by a 
viper several times in the presence of 
Dr. Mortimer, and several other physi- 
cians there; and instantly cured the bite 
by rubbing the part with sweet oil. A dog 
was bitten at the same time, and cured 
by the part being well rubbed with 
sweet oil. Another dog was bitten, 
and died, not being rubbed with sweet 
oil. I think it was about 25 or 30 
years ago. I have known many per- 
sons cured since by rubbing with sweet 
oil. The fat of the viper, or perhaps 
any other oil, might do as well. I think 
this account was published in your 
Magazine [/1./]; and also in a separate pam- 
phlet, and in the Philosophical Trans- 
actions.
