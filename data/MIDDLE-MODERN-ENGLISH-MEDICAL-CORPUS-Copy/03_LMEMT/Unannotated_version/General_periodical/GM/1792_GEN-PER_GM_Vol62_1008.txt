Mr. Urban, 
Nov. 20. 

YOUR benevolence will not be averse 
to communicate to the publick the 
following fact through the channel of 
your valuable and diffusive Miscellany. 
My footman, in bringing up the urn for 
breakfast yesterday, fell with it on the 
stairs, and scalded both his hands and 
arms all over in a dreadful manner. 
His mistress had happened to mention in 
his hearing, but a few days before, the 
great benefit which she and I had re- 
peatedly experienced, from applying ink
immediately to a burn. The moment 
the young man met with his accident, 
he flew to the ink bottle, and spread its 
contents wherever the scald extended. 
In about an hour after, the pain was 
gone; he was able to wait at dinner; 
and this morning he is perfectly well. 

Yours, &c. P. J.
