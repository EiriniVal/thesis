[}Extract from a Book lately published by 
John Chandler, F. R. S. on Colds, very 
necessary to he attended to at this Season 
of the Year. }]
IT is often to be remarked (says our 
author) that persons upon their re- 
turn from the country, at this season 
of the year (whether earlier or in the 
more advanced part of it) to this great 
|P_525
metropolis; very soon after their ar- 
rival, find themselves seized with colds 
without having perceived the least 
symptom of any such complaint, while 
in the country; or without any alte- 
ration of weather, after coming to 
town; which they are apt the more to 
wonder at, as they take it for certain, 
that the air in general must be warmer 
here than it was there; both from the 
numberless buildings which enclose it, 
and from the multitude of fires con- 
stantly kept up by the inhabitants: 
But this, although true, yet is, acci- 
dentally, the very cause of the com- 
plaint. The whole body of the atmos- 
phere in town is constantly in a state 
of preternatural rarefraction; con- 
sequently the cooler and more conden- 
sed air of the country, must be per- 
petually rushing in, as into a vacuum, 
from all sides, and create an artificial 
wind: Moreover, the buildings, e- 
rected in all directions, are so many 
stops to the free currency of the air, 
which is reverberated and circulated 
thro' the streets, lanes courts, and allies, 
and from church yards, and other wide 
openings, and hereby occasion so ma- 
ny streams and eddies of wind, which 
not only meet persons without doors 
in almost every possible position, but 
also encounter them in the passages 
and stair-cases of their own houses, 
and drive through every aperture of 
the chambers they reside in; and this 
happens under the disadvantageous 
circumstance of the body's being more 
warmed, and perspiration more in- 
creased by the greater positive warmth 
of the atmosphere; which, until they 
are settled and accommodated to their 
changed situation, by some longer stay, 
naturally expose them to the very in- 
conveniencies they complain of: To 
avoid which, all weakly persons, or o- 
thers subject to catch cold, and also 
young children, should be used to prac- 
tice every precaution mentioned, re- 
lative to such accidents, upon their 
first essays to go or be carried abroad. 
They should also be admonished against 
frequenting raw, uninhabited rooms, 
or delaying on passages or stair-cases; 
and children should be restrained from 
playing about such dangerous places, 
especially in damp weather, or after 
the houses have been washed; both 
which, from certain stated punctuali- 
ties of cleanliness observed in this 
country, or to satisfy female nicety, 
frequently happen together, and give 
occasion to hoarsenesses, sore-throats, 
coughs and fevers. 

It is very hard, that the more or- 
derly part of our species should be 
most of all exposed to mischiefs of this 
sort, then, when they are in the way 
of their duty; and methinks it should 
not a little import all those, whose of- 
fices it may respectively concern, to 
consider this matter, in relation to the 
washing of churches, and other places 
set apart for divine worship; which is 
generally done, within a little more 
than twelve hours, before the meet- 
ing of the congregation. Some proper 
care to render all such places more 
safe, by keeping them more free from 
that rawness and dampness which must 
necessarily ensue from the present and 
long established custom, would surely 
justify the novelty of some change 
herein; not only as it would be more 
consonant to good sense, and to hu- 
manity, but also, as it might be a 
means to lessen, if not prevent, the 
many interruptions and disturbances 
in the celebration of those solemn ser- 
vices, arising from the pulmonary 
weaknesses, or other more recent dis- 
orders of the trachea and bronchia, in 
various persons, which, in the winter 
season, more especially, there is so 
much ground for others to complain of. 

Whenever, in one or the other sea- 
son, the weather be rainy or moist, it 
is right to keep up a moderate fire in 
all our inhabited rooms, more espe- 
cially in the evening and night times, 
and where persons are accustomed to 
employ themselves, either in their 
studies or counting-houses. It is also 
prudent to have a fire kindled in every 
room, statedly used for dining, reti- 
ring, or rest, after it has been washed; 
as it prevents the damp vapours, which 
arise while it is drying, from flying 
up and bedewing the cieling; fixing 
in drops on the furniture, and trick- 
ling down the wainscotting; or from 
hovering about the room, by absorb- 
ing and directing their course up the 
chimney; moreover, all such rooms 
should be thoroughly dry, before any 
person ventures to sit, stand, and a- 
bove all, to sleep in them; he will be 
more especially liable to receive mis- 
chief by it, when warmed, and put 
into a state of increased perspiration, 
by exercise of any kind; or rather ha- 
ving been in a warm situation, either 
from the sun, or common fire, or 
when heated by any degree of intem- 
perance from meats or wine. 

Some further account of this Book will be 
given in a future Magazine.
