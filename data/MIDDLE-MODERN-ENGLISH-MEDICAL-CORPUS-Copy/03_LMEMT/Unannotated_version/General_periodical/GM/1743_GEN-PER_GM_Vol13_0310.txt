Mr Urban, 

AS Ease is of much greater Importance 
to the Afflicted than Amusement to 
the Disengag'd, I doubt not but the follow- 
ing Receipt will find a Place in your Maga- 
zine, (if Occasion require) even to the 
Postponing of a good Song. 

Yours, &c. J. E. 

[}To cure the Tooth-Ach, }]
[}By a very safe Method, which seldom fails. }]
TAKE a Twig of Birch, bend it square 
about half an Inch from the small 
End; wrap a Thread a few Times round 
the Point; then dip the Tip of it in 
Double Aqua Fortis, apply it to the 
Tooth two or three Times, and wait the 
Event. 

N. B. If the Pain is not constant, but 
returns regularly at certain Periods, the 
above Method will not take Effect; but it 
may be cured by the Jesuits Bark, or a Pre- 
paration of it taken after the same Manner 
as for the Ague.
