[}Diseases in April. }]
THE wind having kept chiefly to the 
westward, and consequently the 
temperature of the air being much 
warmer and moister than in the pre- 
ceding month, very few of the com- 
plaints which shewed themselves in 
any remarkable degree in March have 
kept their footing in April; vernal in- 
termittents, and inflammatory rheu- 
matisms must however be excepted, 
which latter have increased to an un- 
common degree of obstinacy, bidding, 
in a manner, defiance to bleeding, 
purging, and attenuating deobstruents, 
unless plentiful blistering was conjoin- 
ed. Fevers of the eruptive kind, espe- 
cially the petechial and miliary may be 
said to have been the epidemics of this 
month. In the former the spots soon 
turned livid, black, and gangrenous, 
and few patients escaped, who had 
been treated with powersul sudorifics in 
the beginning. Light cordials, tem- 
pered with nitrous acids, had a much 
better effect, and sav'd many, especi- 
ally if thet drank largely of barley- 
water, or the like soft diluting drinks. 
In the latter, the miliary eruptions 
were for the most part of the white 
sort, with a very noisome scent; the 
patients from the beginning quite rest- 
less, in spite of all efforts to procure 
sleep; sometimes with sweats that ra- 
ther depressed than relieved the spirits; 
and deliriums, which blistering seldom 
abated: In a word, few got the better 
of this truly malignant fever, but by 
gentle purges of rheubarb, manna, cream 
of tartar, &c. prudently administered 
about the 8th or 10th day.
