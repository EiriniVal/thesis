Mr Urban, 
Nov. 3. 

IF the following remedy, which I have 
known do good, should give a Me- 
dical Sufferer any relief, it will give me 
great pleasure. 

Take of a strong infusion or decoction 
of linseed, bruised, four ounces, strain it, 
and add of Venice treacle two drams, for 
a glister, to be injected warm at night, 
going to bed, and repeated for some 
time: if he is of opinion he receives any 
benefit, he may add half a dram of the 
Th. for three or four times. 

Yours, &c. Meanwell.
