[}On the Spleen. }]
IN this Essay, first printed in Ire- 
land, the Author treats of that 
Part of Mankind usually term'd the 
Sedentary, Indolent, Splenetic, Re- 
tired, &c. who for some private 
Reason or Resentment retire from 
the World. This perverseness of Tem- 
per commonly infects a whole Fami- 
ly; hence it is so many young Peo- 
ple bring with them into the World 
nothing but Ignorance, Ill-manners, 
Awkwardness, &c. From such severe 
and ill-tim'd Restrictions proceed 
the loosest Morals, and such People 
are generally the greatest Libertines. 

It will be a friendly Office to in- 
form these odd-constitution'd Peo- 
ple how they err: 

He that withdraws himself from 
the Generality of Mankind, and 
chuses for his Society a Part of his 
particular Friends and his Family, 
a rational Education of whom is his 
sole Care, and glories in being Lord 
and Master of his own little Com-

mon wealth: that Man has his Spleen 
well grounded, and thus expresses it 
wisely. Another retires personally, 
but plagues the World with his Li- 
bels and Satyrs on great Men, which 
are no more than the splenetic Ven- 
tilations of some discontented Ano- 
nymous. Another keeps all sorts of 
Company, yet is always railing at 
that World that's his constant Com- 
panion. 

Men of the best Sense are oftenest 
affected in this Manner. Their in- 
tellectual Faculties being very a- 
cute, are necessarily more suscep- 
tible of disagreeable Impressions. 

But as he believes it a Disease of 
a chronical Species, he leaves it to 
be considered by the Physicians, 
hoping what he has said may have 
some Influence on Men of Sense.
