[}A DIALOGUE. }]
[}Dr. Pliant. }]
WELL met my friend—But why this 
sudden gloom? 
No accident! —
[}Dr. Stiff. }]
— Ah, Sir! for grief I've room!—
I'm just from Batson's come; where once 
you know, 
It did my very entrails good to go. 
Batson's of old to Physic gave the law, 
The seat of learning, gravity, and awe! 
But banish'd now is every Medic grace; 
So chang'd!—I hate to go a-nigh the place. 
When Hulse, when Turner grac'd 
the college vow, 
(Ah, brother! we have no such Doctors now!) 
Each son of Sol, to make him look more big, 
Had on a large, grave, decent, three- 
tail'd Wig: 
His cloaths full trimm'd, with button-holes 
behind, 
Stiff were the skirts, with buckram stoutly 
lin'd: 
The cloth-cut velvet, or more reverend black, 
Full made, and powder'd half way down the 
back, 
Large decent cuffs, which near the ground 
did reach, 
With half a dozen buttons fix'd on each: 
Grave were their faces, fix'd in solemn state! 
Those men struck awe; their presence carry'd 
weight. 
In reverend Wigs old heads young shoulders 
bore, 
And twenty-five or thirty seem'd three 
score. 
Ah!—those were times which we no 
more can boast; 
The dignity of Physic now is lost!—
|P_400
Our present race—Oh, how unlike the past! 
Mere Maccaronies—quite a different cast! 
No wigs! or those they have so vastly small, 
As give no weight, no consequence at all. 
Their coats mere jackets, made in taste of 
froth, 
And look as if the taylor cribb'd the cloth: 
Curls on their sides, toupees before you'll find, 
With tails, like Monkies', dangling 
down behind: 
Mirth in their faces; and their only plan 
To look as young as possibly they can. 
But what is worse, those Doctors who ere 
while 
Drest to the height of Æsculapian stile, 
Who once so warm the fashion did oppose, 
Are first to wear Bag Wigs and foppish cloaths! 
Br—y wore, ere drest in this disguise, 
A Wig of pretty tolerable size; 
W—n and * * too, till sunk in like decline, 
Just such another Wig as yours or mine. 
But now! O Pliant! should vast Munkley 
rise, 
And view their heads, he'd scarce believe his 
eyes! 
To make my grief compleat, the world, which 
loves 
New fashions like a child, the mode approves! 
Sway'd by the taste some brother goes astray, 
Flies and deserts his colours every day; 
None will be left, dear Pliant, by and by, 
To grace the cause of wigs, but you 
and I. 
[}Dr. Pliant. }]
Sorry I am, my friend, for your mischance, 
But I can't keep you long in countenance. 
To say the truth, I very soon shall wear, }
(See how 'tis grown) like Br—y, my hair; 
Off goes my Wig to-morrow—Why you 
stare! 
Doctors of old (you tell us) wore large 
Wigs, 
"But they had sense unlike our modern Prigs; "
And 'twas but right, if such enlighten'd men 
Wore Wigs—as emblems of the sense within. 
But since (you say) we've no such Genii now, 
Don't let us merely dress for outside show. 
If we are void of their intrinsic worth, 
Why let our dress be level with our birth. 
[}Dr. Stiff. }]
What then!—Will you the good old cause 
desert? 
Will nought your vile apostacy avert? 
Sail down the current, then! and see with shame 
Me, and Me only, strive against the stream. 
Tho' I the butt of all the college live, 
The sport of boys, as thro' the streets I drive, 
Who overjoy'd cry out in merry jig 
"A Doctor, see! I know it by his Wig. "
Yet still I'll persevere; I'll still go on; 
The honour more as 'twill be all my own.
