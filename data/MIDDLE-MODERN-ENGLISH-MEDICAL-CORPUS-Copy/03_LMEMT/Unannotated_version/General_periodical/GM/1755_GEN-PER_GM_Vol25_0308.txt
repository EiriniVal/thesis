[}Classical Distribution. }]
This belongs to the first order of the 
18th class, according to Mr Ray's me- 
thod, viz. such plants as have a regu- 
lar monopetalous flower, succeeded by 
one single dry seed-vessel.—To the Plan- 
tæ diangiæ polyspermæ of Boerhaave.— 
To the same class and order as the last 
described plant, according to the sys- 
tems of Van Royen and Linnæus. 

[}Description. }]
The root is a foot long, half an inch in 
diameter, white within, but brown on 
the surface, being hard, woody, divi- 
ded into several branches, and of very 
little smell. The radical leaves are a 
foot long and five inches broad, deeply 
sinuated at the edges, pointed at the 
extremity, of a bluish green colour, 
somewhat hoary, of an unctuous clam- 
myness to the touch, and of a very dis- 
agreeable smell. The stalk is thick and 
strong, round, hard and woody, half an 
inch in diameter, and grows to two feet 
high, or more, dividing towards the 
top into several branches; the leaves 
are large and like those at the root; 
they stand alternately. The flowers are 
half an inch in diameter, and more in 
length, of a dusky brownish colour, 
with a deep purple base, and a multi- 
tude of purple lines all over them. 
The cup of the flower is hairy and the 
capsula large, containing a great num- 
ber of seeds. The flowers are very nu- 
merous, and stand in long series on the 
upper sides of the branches. Hill.

This is the only species of Henbane 
|P_309
growing spontaneously in England, and 
it grows likewise in most parts of Europe. 

[}Place. }]
It is a biennial plant, and is very 
common in uncultivated places, especi- 
ally about dunghills, by the road sides, 
and on the banks of ditches, flowering 
in May and June. 

[}Observations. }]
The destructive faculty of this plant 
has been so long known, that it seems 
to have derived both its Greek and En- 
glish name from its pernicious effects. 
Our English name Henbane (the bane of 
hens) is very evidently derived from 
the observation of its effects, perhaps of 
the seeds, upon [/1./] hens, and other 
fowls. The Greek word comes from 
ΰςsus, and κύαμος faba, quasi faba suilla, 
because in this animal its deleterious 
quality was first discovered. Ælian, in 
his history of animals, declaring that 
the wild boars by eating it were seized 
with convulsions and other violent 
symptoms. [/2./]Dioscorides, who enu- 
merates three species of Henbane [/3./]
was acquainted with its narcotic and 
dangerous quality, and condemns the 
use of it. 

The same observation of its effects 
we find in Pliny likewise. [/4./] Later in- 
stances and more accurate observations 
have fully confirmed their opinion and 
proved even its deadly quality. Mat- 
thiolus affirms that he was witness him- 
self to the effects of the seeds eaten by 
some children, [/5./] who were so depra- 
ved in their senses, that their parents 
and neighbours (agreeable to the su- 
perstitious foibles of the times) believ'd 
they were bewitch'd. Parkinson, [/6./]
mentions the case of a friend of his 
who having eaten of the roots of Hen- 
bane, which unwarily were boiled with 
some parsnips for supper, was very 
shortly after taken with a most intolle- 
rable thirst, a total stoppage of his u- 
rine, and vertiginous symptoms in his 
head, affecting his sight very much. 
We find in Wepfer also [/7./] a relation 
of a whole company at an evening en- 
tertainment being thrown into a varie- 
ty of convulsive symptoms by eating, 
though but sparingly, of the roots of 
Henbane, which by mistake were boiled 
with the roots of succory. Another 
instance of its pernicious effects Mr 
Miller gives us as follows: [/8./]In the 
year 1729 there were three children 
poisoned with eating the seeds of this 
plant, near Tottenham court; two of 
which slept two days and two nights 
before they could be awakened, and 
were with difficulty recovered; but 
the third being older and stronger, 
escaped better. Geoffroy also [/9./]
when treating upon this plant, produces 
several instances from the German Ephe- 
merides Naturæ Curiosorum, of its narco- 
tic and dangerous quality. 

The philosophical transactions No. 
451, article 8. contain an extract of a 
letter from Dr Patouillat, physician at 
Toucy in France, to M. Geoffroy, F. R. S. 
and of the royal academy at Paris, gi- 
ving an account of nine persons, who 
upon eating the roots of Henbane, 
which were mistaken for parsnips, were 
all seized with the symptoms of being 
poisoned, with this difference however, 
that some were speechless, and shewed 
no other signs of life than by convul- 
sions, contortions of the limbs, and the 
risus Sardonicus, all having their eyes 
starting out of their heads, and their 
mouths drawn backwards on both 
sides. Others had all the symptoms 
alike. Proper care being taken of 
|P_310
them by giving them vomits, theriaca, 
and salt of rue in warm milk, they were 
all recovered in a few days. Dr Patou- 
illat has not specified whether these ef- 
fects were owing to the black or white 
henbane, though whichever kind it was 
is not material, as the white partakes, 
tho' in a less degree, of the same nox- 
ious quality. 

Another and a later instance of the 
bad consequences attending the eating 
of the leaves of this plant, we find in 
the Philosophical Transactions likewise, 
in a letter from Dr Stedman at Edin- 
burgh, to Dr Pringle, giving an account 
of five men and two women, belonging 
to the Grey's who were then cantoned 
at the village of Vucht near Boisleduc in 
Dutch Brabant. From the nearest con- 
jecture there were from fifteen to twenty 
leaves boiled in about ten quarts of 
water, and tho' they did not eat one 
half, the poison discovered itself in some 
of them in half an hour; they were all 
seized with a giddiness and stupor as 
if drunk. Three of the men were be- 
come quite insensible in three hours af- 
ter taking it, talked incoherently, and 
were in as high a delirium as people in 
the rage of a fever. By proper care in 
vomiting them, and giving warm water 
and oil, they were all saved, tho' some 
of them complained of feebleness, 
weight at their stomachs, others gripes, 
stitches, and head-achs, and all of them 
were vertiginous at times for near a 
month after the accident. Dr Stedman
had attributed these effects to the white 
henbane, but Mr Watson, in his remarks 
upon the account, when read before 
the royal society, observed that it must 
be the black sort, not only from Dr 
Stedman's own description of the plant, 
but from the place in which it grew, as 
the white is not found naturally wild 
in so northern a latitude as Dutch Bra- 
bant. [/10./]

The leaves and roots both of the 
black and white henbane have hereto- 
fore been used in the shops, and stand 
recommended by many authors as use- 
ful in inflammatory swellings, and in 
easing the pains of the gout externally 
used. For these intentions the white is 
recommended by Dioscorides himself, 
[/11./] and even the leaves of the black 
henbane had a place in the London Dis- 
pensatory before the last emendation of 
the college. Prosper Alpinus[/12./] says, 
the Ægyptians use the white as they use 
the stramonium, to procure sleep, bruising 
the leaves and applying them to the 
temples and other parts. The seeds of 
the white henbane have been particu- 
larly recommended in spittings of blood, 
and entered into the composition of 
the Philonium Romanum pilulæ de Cyno- 
glosso, &c. of the former dispensatories, 
but a more extensive and particular 
experience of their effects, and the 
knowledge of better medicines, have 
now superseded the use of them. I am 
convinced from my own experience, 
that their internal use is not adviseable. 
The quantity of two drams of these 
seeds, and two drams of the seeds of 
white poppies being made into an e- 
lectuary with conserve of roses, the 
whole making about four ounces, of 
which the quantity of a nutmeg being 
taken two or three times a day, brought 
on such a continual and troublesome 
vertigo before half the electuary was ta- 
ken, that it seemed dangerous to con- 
tinue the use of it any longer. Those 
who are acquainted with the nature of 
these two ingredients will, I am per- 
swaded, readily attribute the far greater 
share in producing this effect to the 
henbane rather than the poppy seeds. 
It is not improbable, indeed, but the 
seeds here used might be of the black 
kind, as there is reason to think, that 
they are most commonly substituted for 
the white.

this Ægyptian henbane different from the

thicker, and whiter leaves, but Veslingius in 
his notes and observations thinks it the same, 
and says it grows with the yellow sort all over 
the country among the pyramids. He de- 
scribes the plant, and then mentions the use 
of the seeds in restraining fluxes of blood, 
and mitigating pain, whether in the head, 
pleura, or intestines. p. 59.
