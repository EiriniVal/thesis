[}A Method to cure, or at least prevent the 
Increase of any Naval Rupture, and 
that by a Bandage which any one may 
make themselves. }]
TAKE a round piece, five inches di- 
ameter, of the stiffest pastboard, 
such as is commonly used to bind folio 
books with, cover it over with flannel; 
then take a very large button mold, and 
cover it over with flannel also; lay the 
pasteboard between two pieces of new 
strong soft flannel, or dimity, of 8 inches 
square, and sew it fast between the same 
dimity; then few the button mold in the 
middle of the two pieces of dimity, on 
the out-side; which is to be placed in 
the middle of the rupture; sew four 
loops of soft filletings on each side edge 
of the said dimities, each loop about an 
inch long; then have ready two pieces 
twenty inches long, of the broadest soft 
filleting than can be got, and make strong 
eylet holes at every corner, eight in all; 
and tye a pair of tape strings through 
each eylet hole: if twenty inches of 
filleting, and eight inches of dimity, 
tyed together by the loops on the side 
edges, prove too wide, or too narrow, to 
go round the body, they may be length- 
ened or shortened. It must be made a 
few inches less than will go round the 
patients, that it may always be kept as 
tight as they can bear it; for it will 
stretch, and therefore there must be li- 
berty of drawing them closer a little at 
each side, as occasion may require; for 
it will be easier, and do most good to 
keep it tight. If, by tying it too tight, 
'tis at any time uneasy, or pinches the 
skin, slipping the filleting a little higher, 
or lower on the hips, will give it liberty, 
without loosening the strings, and it may 
be slipped up or down soon after: these 
two pieces of filleting must be fastned to- 
gether in the middle, with a bit of tape, 
to keep them five or six inches apart, to 
prevent the bottom one from falling 
down too low; for it is convenient that 
the bottom filleting should go round the 
hips, and the top one go round the sto- 
mach, as high as conveniently may be, 
that the button mold may be kept con- 
fined to the naval; for which purpose, 
'tis proper to have a piece of tape about 
half a yard long, sewed near each cor- 
ner on the upped edge of the dimity; 
thereby making a long loop to pull it 
up by, if it falls down; which loop may 
conveniently enough be fastened to the 
top of any woman's stays, or to the 
neckband of a man's shirt, by a string 
sewed thereon, to be tyed thereto for 
that purpose. Always observe, the bit 
of tape that fastens the two filletings to- 
gether, is kept exactly even on the back- 
bone, or the square piece of dimity will 
not be so well and so easily kept in its 
true place; but a little observation of 
the annexed draft, and care, will keep it 
right; which, by degrees, will dimi- 
nish if not perfectly cure the rupture. 
When it is once well fitted, it will easily 
be kept on day and night, without any 
more trouble than only tying the strings 
a little tighter sometimes, when it 
stretches. 

P. S.  As it is supposed nothing very 
like the bandage herein discribed, has 
ever yet appeared in publick, it is de- 
sired, if you approve of it, that you will 
give it a place in your useful Magazine, 
for the sake of the public good; the 
person who sends it you, having expe- 
rienced the utility of it for a great many 
years past, is unwilling that so simple, 
and yet so effectual a remedy should die 
with him.
