Mr. Urban, 
Honiton, Nov. 4. 

AS it wll ever give me pleasure to 
have it in my power to communi- 
cate to the public any thing that may 
be of service to my fellow-creatures, 
let me beg the favour of you to insert 
in your next Miscellany the underneath 
recipe for a Cancer, which has never 
been known to fail of a cure. It has 
been handed about this neighbourhood, 
with great success, by many genlemen 
who have had the happiness of man- 
kind at heart; and, I flatter myself, I 
shall not merit their disesteem by thus 
endeavouring to render this valuable 
discovery more extensively useful. 

Yours, &c. John Feltham. 

[}A Recipe for a Cancer, 
or any Tumour. }]
TAKE half a pint of the juice of 
bean-leaves when in blossom, of new 
cream a pint, and of the best honey 
half a pound. 

Boil them, in a new unglazed pip- 
kin, very gently, till half is consumed. 

Anoint the part affected twice or 
thrice a day.
