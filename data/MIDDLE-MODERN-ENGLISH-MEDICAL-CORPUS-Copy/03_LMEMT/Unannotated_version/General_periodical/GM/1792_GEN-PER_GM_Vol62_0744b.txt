[}169. An Address to the Governors of the Bath
Hospital, on the Propriety of extending the 
Benefits of that humane and laudable Institu- 
tion. By several of the Governors. }]
SOME difference of opinion among 
the governors, relative to the propriety 
and expediency of building a new hos- 
pital, in a situation better adapted to the 
original purposes of the institution than 
the present, has given rise to this ad- 
dress, which, from the nature of the 
subject, and from the circumstance of 
its being the production of several of 
the governors, highly respectable, as 
well in character as number, cannot fail 
to excite the attention of the publick, 
and, in some degree, to interest every 
person who has the cause of Humanity 
at heart, and who wishes that the 
medical virtues of the Bath waters, so 
often and so happily experienced by the 
opulent, may, as far as it is practicable, 
be felt also by the poor. 

That the gentlemen who oppose the 
measures here contended for, are actu- 
ated by motives which originate in their 
good wishes to the institution itself, we 
cannot entertain a doubt, but it appears 
very clearly to us, that their antagonists 
|P_745
have infinitely the better in point of ar- 
gument; and that the facts upon which 
those arguments are grounded demand 
their most serious and dispassionate con- 
sideration: nor do we see how they can, 
consistently, refuse to go into an inquiry, 
which, as it can have, on either side, no 
other object than the sacred cause of 
humanity and truth,  can never be 
supposed to injure the interests of that 
charity for which they are concerned. 
For the question on which we differ 
(say the advocates for such inquiry) 
is not whether the hospital shall be 
removed or no, but whether the mat- 
ter shall be investigated, for the sole 
purpose of finding out which of the 
two proposals would be most bene- 
ficial. 

The proceedings of the General 
Courts, and of the Committees, upon 
this business, are detailed with great 
precision and candour. The reader is 
fairly put into possession of the subject. 
The objections raised against the re- 
moval of the hospital appear to be given 
in their full force; and they are all, in 
our opinion, completely and most satis- 
factorily answered. The proposed si- 
tuation for the new hospital appears to 
be free from all the inconveniences 
which affect the present, and which (by 
the alterations daily taking place in that 
part of the city) are increasing to an in- 
tolerable degree. It is proved that the 
funds of the hospital will permit the 
governors to appropriate a portion of 
the capital towards extending the bene- 
fits of the charity; and that the public 
wants appear to demand some such ap- 
propriation; and it is observed, with 
equal truth and shrewdness, that a 
charity should avoid being rich, as well 
as poor.  That no difficulty, how- 
ever, may remain with those who, from 
a too timid and cautious prudence, have 
always a dread of incurring large ex- 
pences, whatever be the probable ad- 
vantages to be derived from them, it is 
afterwards shewn that the actual re- 
moval of the hospital will cost less than 
the enlargement of it (which, if it be 
not removed, seems to be agreed on all 
hands to be necessary), by the sum of 
314l. The tenure too, in the former 
case, may be made freebold; whereas in 
the latter it must continue to be held by 
sufferance, as it were, and subject to 
very serious inconvenience. 

A summary view of the general ad- 
vantages to be obtained by the removal 
of the hospital is comprised in the fol- 
lowing extract from the conclusion of 
the address: 

"It may not be improper to observe, that 
the Annual Reports, published for more than 
twenty years past, have constantly stated, 
that since the year 1766 the governors ad- 
mit as many patients as the house will con- 
tain; and hope, by the continuance of cha- 
ritable benefactions, further to extend this 
useful charity.  This shews it to have been 
the uniform intention of the governors to 
provide for the relief of a greater number of 
the objects of the institution, whenever its 
finances would allow of it, and a proper op- 
portunity offered. The injury which the 
present hospital will sustain, in a few years, 
from the improvement of the Lower Town, 
—the benefit which a new site will derive 
from the same cause—a site originally pre- 
ferable to the old, but which could not be 
easily obtained before)—the large surplus of 
income, which has arisen in the last seven 
years;—the enhanced value of the ground 
on which the hospital stands; and the great 
improbability of so favourable an opportunity 
ever offering again for placing it near the sa- 
lutary springs which gave rise to its estab- 
lishment, and from whence it derives its 
importance and usefulness;—form such a 
concurrence of accidental, or rather provi- 
dential, circumstances, connoted with the 
interest of the charity, as demands the pecu- 
liar and unprejudiced attention of the go- 
vernors. "

In a well-written appendix to the ad- 
dress we are informed, that, at a subse- 
quent meeting of the governors, a reso- 
lution for a committee of inquiry was 
again rejected (by a majority of 24 to 
20), and the means of entering into the 
merits of the question effectually, for 
the present, prevented. Upon this sub- 
ject, the addressing governors observe, 

"We know not how to account for this 
conduct, otherwise than by supposing that 
some of the governors, who seem to have 
too hastily formed a decided opinion against 
the removal of the hospital in an early stage 
of the business, and, from a limited view of 
the subject, are apprehensive that a free dis- 
cussion, and a more enlarged view, would 
prove unfavourable to their determination; 
and that, feeling a reluctance (natural to the 
human mind) to retract an adopted opinion, 
or to lose any part of their influence with 
other governors, who probably rely on their 
judgement, they neither wish to be better 
informed themselves, nor choose that their 
friends and the publick should acquire a 
sufficient knowledge of the merits of the 
question to form a competent judgement of 
their own. We trust, however, that the 
importance of the cause in which we are 
|P_746
engaged (the sacred cause of humanity and 
truth), and a regard to the faithful discharge 
of our duty as trustees of the charity, will 
justify our earnestness in its behalf; and we 
shall esteem ourselves happy if our past en- 
deavours, or future services, may tend to 
promote its welfare and extension. "

It appears, that these spirited and 
benevolent gentlemen have actually 
purchased the premises on which they 
wish to erect the new hospital, from 
motives equally honourable to them- 
selves and favourable to the purposes of 
the charity. With an extract from this 
part of the appendix we must conclude 
our remarks; but not without recom- 
mending this pamphlet to the candid 
attention of the friends of the Bath hos- 
pital and heartily wishing that success 
to the generous exertions of their au- 
thors, which their cause and their con- 
duct seem so eminently to deserve. 

sWe cannot, however, conclude this ap- 
pendix to our address without expressing 
our concern at being under the necessity of 
refuting, with the contempt it deserves, an 
insinuation which has been industriously 
whispered into the over-credulous ears of 
the publick, that the purchase of the Alfred 
hotel, and indeed the whole inquiry, tended 
only to promote a mere jobb. The fact is 
simply this: several gentlemen have pur- 
chased Alfred hotel and premises for 1300l. 
for the purposes already mentioned. They 
mean to keep this purchase for two years to 
come, and they have let the Alfred house 
itself to the committee for conducting the 
Bath city infirmary and dispensary for that 
time. This will afford leisure for the gen- 
tlemen, who have hitherto so uniformly en- 
deavoured to suppress an inquiry, to reflect 
coolly on the matter, and to see the propo- 
sal; for the question on which we differ is 
not whether the hospital shall be removed or 
no, but whether the matter shall be investi- 
gated, for the sole purpose of finding out 
which of the two proposals would be most 
beneficial. 

If, however, all our endeavours to com- 
plete this inquiry, in order to enable the go- 
vernors to form an adequate judgement of 
the propriety of the measure, should prove 
unsuccessful, we have only to reflect that we 
have done our duty in the most impartial 
manner, and with a view only to the real 
advantage of the charity: we shall, in this 
case, part with our property in the premisses 
which we have purchased, and apply the 
surplus (which we are assured will be, two 
years hence, very considerable, from the 
improvements carrying on in that part of 
the city) towards the support of such of the 
public charities in Bath as shall then seem 
most to require assistance. 

"With this declaration of our sentiments 
and intentions we take our leave, in perfect 
friendship and cordiality with every gover- 
nor, however opposite to us in opinion; 
and at all times ready and willing to co-ope- 
rate in measures which, in case of the failure 
of our own proposals, shall, by the majority 
of governors, after due deliberation, be 
thought necessary to the welfare and exten- 
sion of this admirable institution. "
