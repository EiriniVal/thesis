Sir, 
Enfield, Nov. 25, 1779. 

Inclosed I send you the propor- 
tions of an extraordinary large child, 
a native of this parish [/1./], as taken by 
|P_127
Mr. Sherwen, an ingenious surgeon 
and apothecary of this place, whose 
accuracy and judgment I can confide 
in, as I have not yet had an opportu- 
nity of examining this phænomenon 
myself. The child's father has the 
conduct of a paper-mill by the side of 
Enfield Marsh, and is I believe about 
36 years of age: his mother about 42, 
and at present of a healthy habit; nei- 
ther of his parents remarkable for 
their size or stature. They have had 5 
children: the eldest of the three now 
living is 12 years old, and rather small 
of his age; but his paternal grandfa- 
ther was of a size larger than ordinary. 
They had another son of uncommon 
proportion, who died of the meazles 
in Jan. 1774, at the age of 15 months; 
the carpenter who made his coffin ob- 
served, that he had never measured so 
tall a child. The present subject, be- 
ing the second of the kind, excites a 
greater degree of curiosity, of which 
the father intends to avail himself, by 
carrying the child up to London, and 
making a public shew of him. 

In the year 1744-5, Dr. Mead 
laid before the Society an account of a 
gigantic boy of two years old, at 
Willingham, in Cambridgeshire. As 
the story may not be fresh in every 
one's memory, I shall compare his 
dimensions with those of young Everit, 
premising this one observation, that the 
Willingham lad, whose name was 
Hall, allowing for his years, was, in 
this respect, less of a prodigy than the 
Enfield boy; though, as Mr. Dawkes, 
the surgeon, who described him, re- 
marks,  he past through the four 
stages of life in less than six years, be- 
ing 5 years and 10 months old at his 
death, and only 4 feet 6 inches high .

Mr. Sherwen annexed the dimensions 
of a fine lusty boy, who is upwards of 
7 years old.

Mr. Sherwen adds, he should have 
been glad to have given the solid con- 
tents of animal substance in pounds 
avoirdupois: but this was not possible, 
as the mother is possest with the vul- 
gar prejudice against weighing chil- 
dren [/2./]. He could therefore only say, 
that, when she exposes his legs, thighs, 
and broad back to view, it is im- 
possible to be imprest with any other 
idea than that of seeing a young giant. 
The boy had very fine hair, pure clear 
skin, free from pimple or blemish: 
he is extremely lively, and has a 
bright clear eye, the pupil not in the 
least dilated; and, excepting a pair of 
broad cheeks, his head is rather less 
in proportion than his other parts. 
From these circumstances Mr. S. ven- 
tures to prognosticate, that he is as like- 
ly to arrive at maturity (accidental 
diseases excepted) as any child he ever 
saw. 

Soon after the date of the above let- 
ter, the boy was carried to a relation's 
in Great Turnstile; but the confined 
situation had such an effect on his 
health, that he was soon brought back 
into his native air. He has now been 
in London above a month, and is ar- 
rived at the following dimensions. 

Height 3 feet 3 inches, round the 
breast 2 feet 6 inches; loins 3 feet 1
inch, thigh 1 foot 10 inches, leg 1 foot 2 
inches, arm 11 inches and a half, wrist 
9 inches, he is well proportioned all 
over, and subsists entirely on the breast; 
was not remarkable when born, but 
at about six weeks after began, and 
has rapidly continued, to encrease to 
his present amazing size. His coun- 
tenance is what every one would call 
comely, but with rather more expression 
in it than is usual at his age, though 
exceedingly pleasing from his being 
uncommonly well tempered. He is 
to be seen from eleven in the morning 
till four, at Mr. Owen's, Confectioner, 
No. 66, Cornhill."
