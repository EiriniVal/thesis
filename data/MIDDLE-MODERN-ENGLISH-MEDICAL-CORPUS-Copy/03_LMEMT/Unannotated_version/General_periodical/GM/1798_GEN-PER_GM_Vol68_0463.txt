THAT useful and valuable medi- 
cine, Rhubarb, is now cultivated 
very generally in the common gardens 
of gentlemen, clergymen, and public 
gardeners; and this has been obtained 
in a great measure by short and fugi- 
tive communications in and from your 
Magazine. 

It would be a grateful communica- 
tion to many of your readers, if some 
of your correspondents would give a 
few short directions to cultivate the

purging Senna. In warm sheltered 
spots of ground, or in the green-house, 
there is a fair prospect of succeeding; 
and, without efforts and trial, it is un- 
reasonable to conclude it improbable, as 
it is shutting the door to all improve- 
ment, especially in the rearing of ma- 
ny valuable medicinal drugs in this 
kingdom

The Peruvian Bark and its uses 
might be supplied by the oak-bark ta- 
ken from clean and healthy oaks fell- 
ed at maturity, and the bark dried 
gradually, and sheltered from rain or 
dews; and, indeed, without that pru- 
dent precaution in weathering, it is at 
this time in many shops used and sold 
for the Peruvian, Jesuits Bark, and 
with general success.
