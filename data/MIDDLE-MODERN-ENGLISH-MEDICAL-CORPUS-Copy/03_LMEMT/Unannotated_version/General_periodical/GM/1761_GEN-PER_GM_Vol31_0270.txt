Mr Urban, 

AN Essay on the medicinal Nature of 
Hemlock, by Dr Storck, appeared 
last year in your Magazine, in which 
its extraordinary virtue and efficacy, 
as well internally as externally used, 
in the cure of cancers, schirrous, and 
Å“dematous tumours, malignant and 
|P_271
fistulous ulcers, and cataracts, are de- 
monstrated and explained; the whole 
being founded on observations made 
in a variety of cases, where this remedy 
was administered by Dr Storck, the Ba- 
ron Van Swieten, Dr Kollman, and o- 
thers of the most eminent physicians 
and surgeons at Vienna. A medicine 
so strongly recommended by persons 
of the first eminence in their profes- 
sions, must give every man, concerned 
in medicine, the greatest pleasure; to 
be able to relieve and cure diseases, 
that have been thought to be incurable 
from the beginning of physic to this 
time, must give every humane soul 
that joy which can be felt, but cannot 
be described. 

The Critical Review, for August last, 
has done due honour to this essay, by 
whose directions I gathered the herb, 
and made the extract, having at that 
time several patients, proper objects to 
try it upon. They punctually observ- 
ed my directions, both internally and 
externally, for the space of three 
months, without the least benefit in a- 
ny respect; then, like many others in 
the kingdom, I took it for granted, 
the herb had not the same virtues in 
England it had at Vienna; the difference 
might proceed from the different climes, 
but in the Gentleman's Magazine for A- 
pril last, p. 157, the ingenious Dr Wm 
Watson has made very judicious obser- 
vations upon the cicuta, or hemlock; 
and has very accurately described three 
sorts of hemlock, viz. the cicuta vul- 
garis, or common hemlock, the cicu- 
taria, cow-weed, or wild cicely, and 
the cicuta minor, or small hemlock. 
This gentleman's observations soon 
convinced me that I had made use of 
the cicutaria, or cow-weed, as I be- 
lieve every other person did who made 
the extract last autumn, for I believe 
the leaves of the common hemlock 
(which is the true) as soon as the seeds 
begin to harden and advance towards 
ripeness, grow dry, and wither away; 
however, Dr Watson says, the leaves of 
the hemlock are most fit for medicinal 
purposes (as being in their greatest per- 
fection) when collected in dry weather 
from the middle of May to the time 
that their flowering stems begin to 
shoot: as by that time the plants will 
have felt the effects of the warm sun, 
have acquired an highly virose smell, 
and the stems of the leaves are covered 
with deep purple spots, an argument 
of the exaltation of their juices. Dr 
Watson's description of the plant set me 
right, for which I beg leave to return him 
my public thanks; and the only mo- 
tive of my writing this letter, is to in- 
form others, who might not have seen 
the Gentleman's Magazine, that the herb 
must be gathered immediately, as it 
is now going into flower, and the suc- 
cess I have met with, since I had the 
extract made from the true hemlock in 
May last, (I have several deplorable ca- 
ses now under my care) and the kind 
aspect some of them have put on this 
last week, from the application of the 
hemlock, internally and externally, 
makes me hope for the success Dr Stork
assures. Some of my patients now take 
thirty grains of the extract morning 
and evening, without any sensible ef- 
fect as to sickness or evacuations. In 
due time the cases shall be faithfully re- 
lated to the public, by their very hum- 
ble servant,
