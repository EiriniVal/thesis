[}A Dying Reflection. }]
—Te moriente mori.— 

WHY should I shrink to dwell amongst the dead 
When every night I lie intomb'd in bed? 
Why dread that sheet should wind me when I dye, 
In which alive I'm not alarm'd to lye? 
Or why?—when the free soul has wing'd its way, 
Deny my fellow worms their destin'd prey? 
Why not, resign'd, of all below take leave, 
And quite compos'd undress me for the grave? 
When the glad spirit sparkles unconfin'd, 
Sure I shall leave all earthly cares behind; 
Shall then forget that Delia's cruel fate 
Left the deep wound of long endur'd regret. 
How cruel guardians kept her from my sight, 
Till grief had veil'd her beauteous eyes in night; 
Till blasted with despair, the frost of love, 
She fled to seek the realms of peace above. 
There Delia! if allow'd a care like this, 
Oh send, and raise me to a taste of bliss: 
From the bright palms thy shining temples twine, 
Oh deign a wreath of dignity to mine! 
And learn me, bless'd above, like thee to know 
The vanity of what I was below. J. G.
