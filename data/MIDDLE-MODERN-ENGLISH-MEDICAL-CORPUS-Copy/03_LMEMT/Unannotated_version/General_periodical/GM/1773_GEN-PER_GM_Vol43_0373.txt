[}On Health. Addressed to the Studious. }]
[}Food. }]
THE studious and sedentary should 
not indulge themselves much with 
sweet things, nor with aliments that 
are rank, oily, greasy, slimy, gluish, 
sour, windy, tough, and hardened by 
smoak and salt. In other respects, they 
may live in the common way, which 
sense and long experience have taught 
their countrymen to use. 

It is a good general rule, that they 
eat and drink such things, and in such 
quantities, as they like and find agree 
with them; but by all means abstain 
from spirits, which curdle the blood 
and juices. 

[}Variety and Temperance. }]
It is wrong to live by any strict me- 
thod, or unvaried rule: a general tem- 
perance is sufficient; for nature delights 
in varying the sorts and quantity of 
food, and prefers a generous way of 
living before a very abstemious one; 
because the latter shrivels up the tubes 
of the body. 

Some recreation and resth should be 
used, at least half an hour before and 
after every meal. 

[}Cleanliness. }]
Cleanliness in their persons, espe- 
cially in their teeth, and in their clothes 
and houses, contributes greatly towards 
health. 

[}Exercises and Amusement. }]
A variety of such exercises (begun 
gently, and encreased gradually) as 
entertain the fancy, and amuse the 
thoughts, should be used in the open 
air, at least two hours every day, and 
a frequent change of air is very useful. 
Walking and riding, the cold bath, 
and friction, will make the fluids cir- 
culate regularly in the human body, 
which is a hydraulic machine compos- 
ed of many vessels, whereof some are 
very small. 

[}Conversation. }]
They ought, at and after supper, to 
enjoy social life in chearful and agree- 
able company. These things do in an 
easy manner employ a new set of fibres, 
and relieve those that are fatigued by 
study; they introduce pleasing thoughts 
into the mind, and thereby refresh and 
raise the spirits. 

Sweat should put an end to bodily 
labour, and weariness to the exercises 
of the body and mind. Fatigue should 
be always avoided. 

[}Passions. }]
A due government of the passions, 
contentment, chearfulness, hope, justice, 
benevolence, fortitude, and tempe- 
rance, preserve and promote health. 

The studious should rise and go to 
bed early; the morning is the best 
time for bodily exercises and study; but 
late watchins, the air of the night, 
and the oily smoke of candles, are very 
hurful. 

[}Posture. }]
We should often change our posture 
at our study; sometimes sit, and some- 
times stand, or walk.

[}Change of Study. }]
A change of study relieves some 
fibres by employing others, and in 
some measure answers the purposes of 
rest and recreation. 

Immoderate study, like a ligature 
applied to all the nerves, retards the 
animal spirits, hurts the brain, which is 
in action all the time we think, and 
often causes a lunacy. The brain is 
also hurt, and nervous diseases are pro- 
duced, by the weariness of the eyes: 
and learning, when exchanged for 
health and happiness, is certainly 
bought too dear. 

Reading aloud, and singing moderate- 
ly, in the morning, are reckoned good 
for the stomach; but medicines gene- 
rally hurt it, and should not be used 
even when necessary without the advice 
of an honest and skilful physician. 

Much study is a weariness to the 
flesh; and a young child, whose brain 
is soft, and an old person, whose brain 
is hard, should not study much, be- 
cause in these two extremes the brain is 
unfit to bear the oscillations of the 
fibres.
