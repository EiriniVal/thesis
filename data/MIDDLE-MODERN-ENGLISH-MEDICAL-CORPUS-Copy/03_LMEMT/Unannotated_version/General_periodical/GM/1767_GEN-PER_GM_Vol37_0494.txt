[}The Cause of the late Attack upon the 
College of Physicians in Warwick- 
Lane. }]
THe Colleges of Physicians in Lon- 
don, Dublin and Edinburgh, are 
by charter invested with a power of call- 
ing before them all Physicians not edu- 
cated at the respective Universities, who 
practice Physic within their precincts; 
to examine, and if found duly qualified, 
to licence them. It was always, until 
of late, understood, that such Licenti- 
ates had no right to demand admission 
to fellowships; and that whenever this 
was done, it was not granted in compli- 
ance with a claim, but conferred speciali 
gratia. Upon those occasions the Col- 
lege of London made use of the expedi- 
ent of procuring for such Licentiate a 
mandamus degree from Oxford or Cam- 
bridge, which intitled him to a seat as 
Fellow. 

Though such favours were bestowed 
but sparingly, the Licentiates seemed to 
acquiesce under regulations which were 
supposed to be warranted by charter: 
But the Fellows having lately enacted a 
bye-law, excluding from all prospect of 
being Fellows, such of the Licentiates 
as had at any time practised Surgery; 
(though it appears from former lists of 
the London Fellows, that this was not 
always considered as a sufficient objecti- 
on) the Licentiates were alarmed and 
offended at this stigma fixed on a number 
of their members, many of whom bear a 
very distinguished rank in medical repu- 
tation and practice; and being assured 
by their Council learned in the law, that 
their previous admission as Licentiates 
gave them a claim to fellowships, they 
have taken the extraordinary method 
taken notice of in the public papers, of 
vindicating and asserting this their sup- 
posed claim. How far this claim is 
founded in justice, or whether it can be 
supported by law, the event alone must 
determine.
