Mr. Urban, 
Dec. 4. 

HAVING observed in your last, 
p. 945, an article, recommend- 
ing the use of diluted vitriolic acid as 
a cure for Sea-scurvy, I think it my 
duty, as a friend to my country, whose 
welfare at all times, but particular- 
ly at this moment, depends on her 
Navy, to combat what I conceive to be 
a pernicious error, into which your 
well-intentioned, though ill-informed, 
Correspondent has fallen. This me- 
dicine, in consequence of the recom- 
mendation of a foreign quack, and 
with the countenance of the College 
of Physicians, was introduced into 
general use in the Navy 60 or 70 years 
ago, and given gratuitously to the 
navy surgeons ever since that time. 
Now, with regard to the effect of it, 
I, as an anonymous Correspondent, 
can claim no weight nor authority; 
|P_1029
but I entreat your correspondent, and 
those who may have given credit to 
his information, to make enquiry of 
epxerienced navy surgeons, command- 
ers in the navy, and the public offices; 
when they will be informed, that this 
medicine has never been of any sen- 
sible use in the cure of scurvy; but 
that another acid, the virtues of which 
deserve to be made known through 
every channel, and among others 
your diffusive Magazine, has been 
found an infallible prevention and cure 
for this malady, which, till now, has 
so much crippled, embarrassed, and 
distressed, our naval enterprizes. This 
is the acid of lemons and limes, of 
which the general use has been adopt- 
ed in the navy within these few years, 
upon the most incontestable grounds of 
evidence, and with the best possible 
effect.
