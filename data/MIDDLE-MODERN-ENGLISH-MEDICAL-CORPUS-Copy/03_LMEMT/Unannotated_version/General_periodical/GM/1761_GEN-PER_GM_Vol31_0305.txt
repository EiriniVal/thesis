Mr Urban, 

THE utility of public hospitals is 
universally acknowledged, as they 
tender the welfare of such objects as 
are incapable of helping themselves. 
That now erected at the city of Ox- 
ford must be of two-fold advantage, as 
it cannot fail of improving the study 
of physic in that university, at the 
same time that it affords a powerful 
relief to the afflicted. 

It were much to be wished, that her 
sister Cambridge would in this respect 
imitate her, as I believe few univer- 
sities abroad would then be able to vie 
with them in improving the medical 
art. And, indeed, if every great mar- 
ket town in the kingdom had one 
founded in it, we should not so fre- 
quently hear, as we do, of those un- 
happy disasters of broken limbs being 
attended with such calamitous cir- 
cumstances as they commonly are. If 
it is deemed wisdom in societies to 
provide for the infirm and needy, sure- 
ly it must be proportionably more so 
to provide for those who exhibit mi- 
sery to us in the strongest light. To 
elucidate the truth of what is here ad- 
vanced, there needs only a view to be 
taken of their good effects in this great 
metropolis; and as no one will deny 
the necessity of them here, so their 
utility in every other populous place 
can admit of no dispute. 

All that is aimed at is the general 
good of mankind; which, for us to be 
conscious of, and not to promote, is 
derogatory to the end and design of 
our being. 
Yours, &c. 
F. Y.
