[}A World of Quacks; A New Ballad; }]
Tune of, Of Noble Race was Shenkin. 

NO longer Quacks disparage, 
Since an Empirick's the Basis 
And Root of all, 
Both great and small, 
Profession, Post, and Trade is. 
That Empirck, the Attorney, 
Each Quirk in Law is his Trick, 
Whose Ell-long Bills 
Are worse than Pills, 
And purge us more than Physick, 
Each cunning City Trader 
A Mountebank out-lyes, Sir, 
While damag'd Wares 
Are sound he swears, 
That you may give his Price, Sir, 
State Empiricks the worst are, 
Tho' oft in highest Station, 
Who, base and vile, 
Their Prince beguile, 
While they oppress the Nation. 
Thus plainly have I shewn ye 
The Truth of my Assertions, 
What Tricks are play'd 
In ev'ry Trade, 
By Quacks of all Professions. 
Hence 'tis [^A bar of ten stars in the middle of the line. ^] the Scandal, 
Of Europe, and its Shame, Sir, 
Since Impudence, 
And Want of Sense, 
To all that's Great lays Claim, Sir.
