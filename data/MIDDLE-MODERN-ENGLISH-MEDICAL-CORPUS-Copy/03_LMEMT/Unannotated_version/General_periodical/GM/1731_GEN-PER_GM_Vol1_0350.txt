[}A CURE for the GOUT. }]
OGout! thou puzzling knotty Point, 
Who knick'st Man's Frame in every Joint, 
Like Surgeon's Hall you Richness gain, 
by screwing Mortal Limbs to Pain: 
First Miner like, you work below, 
To sap Man's Fabrick by the Toe; 
So Footing take, where Footing ends, 
As Hebrew reading backward tends. 
If Med'cine can't the Smart dislodge, 
From Bone to Bone you play, and dodge; 
Then in Revenge, like flying Foe, 
You burn and Cripple where you go. 
So sour Saps from Crab-tree Root, 
Begin below and upwards shoot; 
And where malignant Juices flow, 
Close knotty Nobs in Sharpness grow: 
Old Oedipus, the Theban King, 
Felt swelling Joints and Gouty Sting, 
And though the Sage could Sphinx explain, 
He never could unriddle Pain. 
Let Stoicks boast of Indolence, 
Man's Case attains a feeling Sense, 
And what is worse, the affected Part, 
Finds small Relief by Doctor's Art: 
The Skill of Mead confounded stands, 
When Patient roars, my Toe! my Hands! 
It as Friend [/1./]Tully often hints, 
Man's Case a Prison represents, 
The Gout supplies the Goal with Chains, 
And fills the Tenements with Pains. 
Corrosive Pains, that cramp the Bone, 
And stop all Motion but their own; 
But as Apollo, God of Wit, 
Besides his Physick, keeps a Kitt: 
No doubt to sooth the Patient's Heart, 
When Med'cine can't remove the Smart: 
This pleasing Lenitive admit, 
Perhaps a Tune may lull the Fit, 
I've heard that Bees when ranging found, 
Are charm'd to Peace by tinkling Sound; 
When cutting Teeth, or ill plac'd Pin, 
Molest a tender Infant's Skin, 
Shrill Lullabies in Nurses Strain, 
Asswage the peevish Bantling's Pain; 
Then as the Humours throb and ake, 
This easy, safe Prescription take. 
In Elbow Chnir Majestick sit, 
In full high Twinge, yet scorn to fret, 
Suppose yourself in Papal See, 
Extending Toe to Devoteee: 
From these Examples cease to fume, 
And in the soothings Flannel's room, 
Wrapt round your Joints this healing Verse, 
'Tis Patience proves the kindest Nurse.
