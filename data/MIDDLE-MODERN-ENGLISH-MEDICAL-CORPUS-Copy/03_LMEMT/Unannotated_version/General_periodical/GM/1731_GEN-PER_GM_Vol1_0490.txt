[}Of Wit, Humour, Madness and Folly. }]
JUdgment and Discretion are the 
Limits of Sense and genuine 
Wit: Below these is an endless Va- 
riety of monstrous and irregular 
Minds. Thro' the Deviations of 
Nature in the Formation of the 
Head, Thousands are incompleat 
to One that is brought to Per- 
fection. Hence Fops, Half-wits, 
Pedants and Coxcombs are sub-di- 
vided into numberless Branches, all 
diversified by their peculiar Odd- 
nesses and specifick Caprices, which 
arise, perhaps, only from an im- 
proper Length, Size or Situation 
of a Fibre, from a disproportion'd 
Humour; or an immoderate Ferment 
in the Composition. 

When the Madman and the Fool 
meet in the same Complexion, ac- 
cording as either prevails, the Pro- 
|P_491
duction is a Coxcomb, or a meer 
Wit; which are multiplied into 
numerous Kinds; from these pro- 
ceed the subordinate Classes of am- 
biguous Animals, to which the rati- 
onal and irrational World pretend. 
Such are the several Tribes of the 
Half-craz'd, Impertinents, Pedants, 
perpetual Talkers, Men of Form, 
Masters of insignificant Eloqnence, the 
affected, and those who affectedly la- 
bour to appear unaffected. 

If the Madman is superior in the 
Mixture, a Progeny is produced of 
shining Fops, Poetasters, petulant Laugh- 
ers, and morose false Criticks. If the 
Fool prevails, you have a surpriz- 
ing Race of crafty Block-heads. 

A young Gentleman in the Court 
of France, in the Reign of Henry
III, was graceful in his Person, 
humane, obliging, and beloved by 
all, but with so small a share of 
Sense, that his Conversation was 
low and trifling. It happened that 
he grew distracted; and the Fer- 
ments of the Madman, having a- 
gitated and exalted the flegmatick 
Fool, he became an ingenious and 
pleasant Companion. The Court 
was mightily pleased, and engag'd 
the King's Physicians to undertake 
his Cure. The Gentleman recoverd, 
and the Fool with him; his shining 
Parts were sunk and effac'd, and 
his Head reduced to it's original 
Softness. 

Hence perhaps, the known Ob- 
servation, That all Great Wits have 
a Tincture of Madness; on the other 
hand there is a Species speculative- 
ly wise, and practically Fools, of 
whom it may said, They never speak 
a silly Thing, and never do a wise One.
