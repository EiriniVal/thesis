[}Upon the late Sickness of her Grace, the 
Dutchess of Beaufort. }]
MUSE, for ever fair and young, 
Soft inspirer of my song, 
Tell me, Clio! tell me true, 
Didst thou ever blended view, 
Such affliction, such a grace, 
So much beauty with distress. 
See the partner of her care 
Sooth with hopes the drooping fair, 
Faithful consort of her bed; 
Jove so chear'd, when Venus bled. 
Envy pale with listless pain, 
Gloomy sickness in her train, 
Thus attempts to cloud our day, 
Thus to take our gem away. 
But virtue, enemy to fate, 
Gives that life a longer date; 
Virtue, once expell'd mankind, 
Chose in her a form refin'd, 
Thence a better charm to take, 
Lovely both in heart and make, 
Long to tread this earthly stage, 
And reform a guilty age: 
For when she shall be no more, 
Virtue flies, that fled before; 
Never like again to meet 
With so beautiful a seat; 
Nor, confest in charms, to rise, 
Virtue's gone when Beaufort dyes. W. Câ€”e.
