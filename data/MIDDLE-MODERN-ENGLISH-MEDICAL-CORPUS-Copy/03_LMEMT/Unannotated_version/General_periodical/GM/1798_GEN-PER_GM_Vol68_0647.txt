Mr. Urban, 
August 6. 

[^Decorative frame around the letter "I".^]I SEND you the fol- 
lowing queries with 
no other motive than 
a sincere desire to pro- 
mote the welfare and 
happiness of my fel- 
low-creatures. 

Ward's medicines have for many 
years been sold, at a very small price, 
for the benefit of the publick; and, if 
they are as safe and efficacious as they 
are represented, the scheme of serving 
the poor in this manner was highly 
meritorious. It was enabling them to 
find relief, in almost all their disor- 
ders, without that heavy expence 
which generally attends an application 
to the Faculty. But, as it is well 
known that, in a course of years, the 
best medicines are frequently neglect- 
ed, or superseded by more fashionable 
prescriptions, and those perhaps of in- 
ferior efficacy, it will be of great im- 
portance to prevent those that are re- 
ally valuable from sinking into disuse, 
or, by misapplication, into disrepute. 

The first article, and the only one, 
to which I shall confine my enquiries, 
is the white drop. Is it actually 
the best antiscorbutic, and the best pu- 
rifier of the blood, in practice? How 
long may it be proper to continue it as 
an alterative? What effects has it been 
known to produce in different disorders? 
What regimen is necessary while the 
medicine is continued? And, has any 
inconvenience attended it? 

As I do not wish to see Mr. Urban's 
pages filled with cases, I shall be glad 
to receive an answer to these queries 
from some of your medical or intelli- 
gent correspondents, and from them 
only, in a concise and summary form. 
As this medicine is sold for the sole 
benefit of the Asylum and the Mag- 
dalen-hospital, this letter, I am per- 
suaded, cannot be considered as the 
recommendation of a nostrum, or as 
dictated by any other principle than 
that of disinterested benevolence. 

Your, &c. Homo.
