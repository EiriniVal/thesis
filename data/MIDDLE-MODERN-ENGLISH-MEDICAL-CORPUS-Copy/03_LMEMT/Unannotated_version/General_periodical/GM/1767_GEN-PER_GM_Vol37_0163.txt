Mr Urban, 

THE Measles, though not so fatal 
as the Small-pox, is yet attended 
in the natural way with many dan- 
gerous symptoms, and often produce 
very troublesome effects. I would 
therefore beg leave to recommend to 
the public the practice of inoculation 
in this distempter as well as the other, 
and am confident that by this method 
many may be preserved from that ma- 
lignant sort which often proves mor- 
tal and is always dangerous. 

Dr Francis Hume, was the first who 
attempted this practice at Edenburgh
about nine years ago, since which, 
many physicians in that country have 
followed his example, though I do not 
find it is much encouraged in England, 
though in the small-pox it is now be- 
come universal. 

The method is easy, may be per- 
formed with safety by a careful nurse, 
and is not attended with the remotest 
danger. 

Dip only a little bit of cotton, or 
lint, in the watry humour that stands 
in the eyes of persons ill of the measles 
about the time of the crisis, make a 
slight scratch in the skin of the arm, 
above the elbow, of the person to be 
inoculated, put the wetted pledget 
upon the incision, and cover it with a 
bit of sticking plaister to keep it on; 
and this, without farther trouble, will 
produce the measles in a gentle and 
favourable degree, which, during the 
whole course of it, will want no other 
care but that of keeping the patient 
moderately warm, nor any attendance 
but that of watching the fever, and 
encouraging the crisis, which, in a 
few days, will carry off the infection, 
and compleat the cure. This epide- 
mic disease should be communicated 
to those young subjects who have not 
yet had it, when it makes its first ap- 
pearance in any neighbourhood, by 
which the dangerous symptoms that 
often attend it will be effectually pre- 
vented. 
I am, Sir, &c. J. Cook.
