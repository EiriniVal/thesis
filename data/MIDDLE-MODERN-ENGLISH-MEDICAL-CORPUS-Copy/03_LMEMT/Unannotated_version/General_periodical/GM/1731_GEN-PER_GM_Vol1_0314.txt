[}A Receipt to cure the Stone and Gravel, communicat- 
ed to the Publick in the Daily Journal by a Physician. }]
TAke Marsh Mallow Leaves, the Herb 
Mercury, Saxifrage, and Pellitory 
of the Wall of each, fresh gather'd (now 
in their prime) three handfulls; cut 
them small with a pair of Scissers, and 
mix them together, and pound them in 
a clean Stone Mortar, with a Wooden 
Pestle, till they come to a Mash, then 
take them out, and spread them thin, 
in a broad glaz'd Earthen Pan, and let 
them lie, stirring them about once a Day, 
till they are thoroughly dry, (but not in 
the Sun) and then they are ready, and 
will keep all the year long. Of some of 
these Ingredients so dried, make Tea, as 
you do common Tea, with boiling hot Wa- 
ter, as strong as you like to drink it, 
but the stronger the better, and drink 
three, four, or more Tea cups full of it, 
Blood warm, sweetned with coarse Su- 
gar, every Morning and Afternoon, put- 
ting into each Cup of it, at least half 
a Spoonful, or rather more, of the ex- 
press'd Oil of Beech Nuts, fresh drawn, 
(which in this Case has been experien- 
ced to be vastly preferable to Oil of Al- 
monds, or any other Oil) stirring them 
about together, and so to continue it for 
as long as you see Occasion. 

This Medicine, however simple soever 
it may seem to some, is yet a fine emolli- 
ent Remedy, is perfectly agreeable to the 
Stomach, (unless the Beech Oil be stale 
or rancid) and will be found to sheathe, 
and sosten the Asperity of the Humours 
in general, particularly those that gene- 
rate the Gravel and Stone, and will re- 
lax and supple the Solids at the same 
Time: And it is well known by all Phy- 
sicians, that emollient Medicines do lu- 
bricate, widen, and moisten the Fibres, 
so as to relax them into their proper Di- 
mensions, without forcing the Parts. [/1./]

Note. The Beech Oil, required in the above Receipt, is to be had at
