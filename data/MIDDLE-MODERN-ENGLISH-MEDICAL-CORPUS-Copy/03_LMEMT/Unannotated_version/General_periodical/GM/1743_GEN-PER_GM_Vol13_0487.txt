[}A Receipt to prevent Infection of the 
Plague, or cure it when infected, seve- 
ral Times repeated in that Paper. }]
TAKE three Pints of Muscadine, and 
boil therein a Handful of Red Sage and 
a Handful of Rue, till a Pint be wasted; 
then strain it, and set it over the Fire 
again, and put to it a Pennyworth of Long 
Pepper, half an Ounce of Ginger, a quar- 
ter of an Ounce of Nutmegs beaten toge- 
ther; then boil it a little; then take it off, 
and put into it one Ounce of the best Venice
Treacle, and half an Ounce of the best 
Mithridate, and a quarter of a Pint of 
the best Angelico Water.â€”Take it al- 
ways Morning and Evening, warm; one 
Spoonful or two, if infected, if not one 
Spoonful is sufficient; one half in the Morn- 
ing a the other at Night. All the 
Plague Time, under God, trust to it, for 
there never was Man, Woman or Child 
deceived by it: It is good in all other ma- 
lignant Distempers.
