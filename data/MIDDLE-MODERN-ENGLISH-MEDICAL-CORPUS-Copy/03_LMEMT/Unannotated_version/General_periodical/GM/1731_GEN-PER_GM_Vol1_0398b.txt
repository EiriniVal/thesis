[}An Epigram occasion'd by the Peach Stone. }]
DRink on, my friends, dring[/1./]Yeoman dry, 
Nor fear a want of wine; 
A Peach-stone can that want supply, 
As sings a Bard divine. 
If so, how blest are Astrop Beaux! 
What happiness they boast! 
Maria sparkling wine bestows: 
'Beata gives a toast. 

[^1. 
* Yeoman, the person who keeps the tavern 
at Astrop Wells.
