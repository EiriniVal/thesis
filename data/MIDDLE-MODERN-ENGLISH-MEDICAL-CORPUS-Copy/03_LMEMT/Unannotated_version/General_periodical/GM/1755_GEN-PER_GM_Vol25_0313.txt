[}The Efficacy of Electricity in the Cure of 
Diseases, determined by a great Variety 
of Experiments made by Appointment 
of the Royal College of Physicians in 
Sweden. }]
DR Rosen, the king's first physician, 
and professor Stromer, having 
made certain trials, from whence it 
was judged expedient to examine fur- 
|P_314
ther into this new method of cure. 
Dr Zetzell was appointed to pursue it 
every day at certain hours in the pub- 
lick hospital of Upsal, on various sub- 
jects under different disorders; which 
he continued to do for the space of 
two years. The result of his expe- 
riments is contained in the following 
extract. 

[}In the Amaurosis, or Gutta Serena. }]
In two patients the electrical sparks 
were drawn from the parts near 
the eyes without the least benefit, 
nor was the electrical shock from the 
phial found to succeed better; so that 
electricity promises little in this dis- 
order. 

[}In the Gout. }]
Pains of the joints were frequently 
observed to cease by exciting the e- 
lectrical sparks; but then the gou- 
ty matter seemed to be repelled in- 
ward, and produced symptoms of 
more grievous consequence: So that 
it was often found, that if this ap- 
plication was continued, pains of the 
head, vertigo's, sickness at stomach, 
and violent gripings would take place, 
which again disappeared as soon as 
nature was able to repel the morbid 
matter back to the joints. Some un- 
der this treatment urined very plen- 
tifully, and fell into copious sweats in 
the night, which gave hopes that in 
time the obstinacy of the disease might 
be thus subdu'd; but experience prov'd 
the contrary, the before-mentioned ill 
symptoms all returning in a severer 
degree; so that all hopes of benefit 
to gouty patients from electricity are 
at an end. 

[}In an inveterate Head-ach. }]
In this chronical case drawing out 
the electrical sparks produced a mi- 
tigation, and often a cessation of 
the pain; but when it was thought 
that an absolute cure had been effect- 
ed, the disorder returned with great 
aggravation: It is, however, worthy 
note, that where proper internal re- 
medies were given at the same time, 
the desired effect was speedily pro- 
duced. 

[}In Contractions. }]
Electricity has certainly removed so 
many complaints of this kind, as to 
deserve being tried wherever the like 
occur. One who had lost the use of 
his limbs from cold for several years, 
was at length quite restored by the 
use of Electricity, and another whose 
knee joint had been above five years 
contracted from a rheumatism, was 
able to streighten it after twice elec- 
trifying. But in attempting the cure 
of such disorders by this Method, it 
is of great Importance to distinguish 
carefully which are the Muscles that 
are affected; for it is those alone from 
which sparks are to be drawn, and 
by no means from their antagonists, 
which on the other hand should be 
relaxed by warm fomentations appli- 
ed for some hours together, and after- 
wards anointed with some emollient 
unguents. At the beginning of this 
course the stomach ought to be forti- 
fied with some generous liquor, lest 
the matter removed from the joint 
should be deposited upon the nobler 
parts. The electrical shock is not 
near so efficacious, as simply drawing 
out the sparks. 

[}In Deafness and Singing of the Ears. }]
When deafness arises from indurated 
wax, the drawing of sparks by an iron 
stile will help to dissolve it, or if the 
deafness has followed a fever, it will 
promote the digestion of the metasta- 
sis; but in a catarrhal deafness, arising 
originally from a humid air, and in 
singing of the ears, all that could 
be done by electricity turned to very 
little account. 

[}In the Epilepsy. }]
In some epileptics it has certainly 
been serviceable, but if the complaint 
was hereditary, or owing to a fright, 
it did no sensible good or harm. 

[}In Felons. }]
The electrical sparks bring them to 
a speedy digestion. 

[}In Ganglions. }]
In the only three cases of a gan- 
glion on which electricity was tried, 
it dispersed them perfectly. 

[}In Hysteric Disorders. }]
In these it was never found to be 
attended with the least benefit. 

[}In the Sciatica. }]
In some the pains has been greatly 
appeased by electrisation, but return- 
ed again afterwards; in some it was 
not at all abated; in others the suc- 
cess appeared extraordinary at first, 
but after a few days the force of the 
disorder was turned upon the intestines, 
with excruciating torments. 

|P_315
[}In the Tooth-ach. }]
Where the anguish was owing to 
hollow teeth, or from a catarrhal or 
scorbutic habit, it seldom failed of 
producing a perfect cure, though at 
first the pain seemed to be increased, 
and raged for 24 hours, after which 
it went off entirely. The sparks should 
be drawn from the affected tooth by 
means of an iron stile, for a good 
while together. 

[}In Costiveness. }]
The experiments boasted of so much 
in Italy of including cathartics within 
the electrifying glass (see Vol. xxii. p. 76.) 
were very frequently tried, but could 
never be made in the least to succeed 
in Sweden. 

[}In Palsies. }]
The commotion with the Leyden phial 
has been made on paralytics here 
without any benefit, nor were the 
muscles irritated by drawing sparks 
from them with any better consequence; 
yet sometimes by chance the pain has 
been so severe on an otherwise insen- 
sible part, as to be hardly tolerable; 
and when such parts were once dis- 
covered, the sparks were continually 
drawn from them alone: This was re- 
peated so often on a citizen of Upsal, 
who was a true paralytic, that he was 
perfectly cured thereby. 

[}In Quartans. }]
From the few trials that have been 
made in this disease, nothing can be 
concluded for certain. In two cases 
the fits were lessened to a kind of pe- 
riodical tensions only, and in a third 
they totally ceased. 

[}In Quotidian Agues. }]
Electricity has been applied to two 
patients only in this disorder, in whom 
the sparks were excited all over their 
bodies. One lost the ague for some 
time, after which it returned; in the 
other it was not at all put off, but 
changed into a tertian. 

[}In Rheumatisms. }]
What has been said before about 
the sciatica, may be affirmed of this 
disorder. 

[}Conclusion. }]
1. In intermittent fevers electrifica- 
tion is insignificant. 2. In rheuma- 
tic, arthritic, and sciatic complaints, it 
is very seldom that any advantage is 
gained without a translation of the 
morbitic matter inwards. 3. There 
is a great agreement between paraly- 
tic and rheumatic disorders. A rheu- 
matism, with deafness, tremors, and 
a difficulty of motion in one entire 
side, wherein the electrical sparks oc- 
casioned a most painful sensation, was 
so far conquered, that the patient had 
the use of his arm restored, and then 
was seized with an opthalmia, which 
being repelled by cooling collyriums, 
the arm became motionless again. 4. 
In a palsy of two of the fingers of one 
hand only, electricity was made use 
of to no purpose. 5. In all cases a 
long use of electricity brings on a 
costiveness, and an increase of appe- 
tite, most probably from promoting 
insensible perspiration. 6. A saliva- 
tion is excited by drawing sparks from 
the parotid glands, and from the in- 
side of the mouth. 7. In the tooth- 
ach it is good to draw sparks with an 
iron style, from the hard portion of 
the nerves of the seventh pair, called 
the bur of the ear, though the patient 
complains of an exquisite pain at that 
instant. 8. Animals of the serpent 
kind are killed by the electrical com- 
motion, and become exceeding rigid 
when dead.
