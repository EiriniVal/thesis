Mr. Urban, 
Dec. 31. 

HAVING from a very early period 
of my life been a reader and sin- 
cere admirer of your useful Miscellany, 
I have frequently observed with pleasure 
the obliging readiness with which your 
correspondents have answered those re- 
quests, either for information or relief, 
which have been addressed to them. 
Encouraged by the recent success of A 
Mother of many Children, and A Me- 
dical Sufferer, I address myself to the 
benevolence of any of your numerous 
readers who are acquainted with a re- 
medy for that almost universal and pain- 
ful complaint, corns on the feet. 

It is necessary to premise, that many 
of the boasted specificks daily advertised 
have been tried (by various persons) 
without the least benefit, or even tem- 
porary relief. I avoid enumerating the 
particular ones, that I may not offend 
the different proprietors or venders. 
Should any of your readers be acquain- 
ted with any method of eradicating, or 
even alleviating, the complaint above- 
mentioned, and have the goodness to 
communicate it, they will have the sa- 
tisfaction of conveying relief to, and 
exciting the gratitude of, thousands, as 
well as to 
X. Y. Z.
