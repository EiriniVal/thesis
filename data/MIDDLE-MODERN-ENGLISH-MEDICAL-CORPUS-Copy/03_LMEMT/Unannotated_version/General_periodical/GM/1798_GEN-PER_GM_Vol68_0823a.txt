Mr. Urban, 
Greenwich, Oct. 12. 

[^Decorative frame around the letter "D".^]DURING the sixty-eight 
years your Miscellany 
has stood superior to 
the Ephemera it has 
often produced, not a 
Volume can be turned 
over, which cannot justly 
boast of some useful discovery in the 
Arts, in Agriculture, or in Medicine. 
â€”Let not then, I conjure you, the 
present year pass over, without calling 
loudly on your learned Correspondents 
to employ their best thoughts in de- 
vising some antidote to that fell Ra- 
vager, the Yellow Fever, whose 
devastations you so frequently record. 

Surely, Mr. Urban, it would add a 
noble wreath to the well-earned laurels 
of the most respectable Member of the 
College of Physicians, or even on the 
whole College, if a handsome premium 
were to be offered to the writer of the 
best Essay on so interesting a subject. 
A remedy, perhaps, may not at once be 
found; but even an approximation to 
an object so every way desirable might 
draw down on the proposer the grateful 
blessings of thousands that may at pre- 
sent be liable to the baneful malady. 

It is well known that the chemical 
researches of the last century, though 
fruitless as to the conversion of metals 
into gold, were productive of a thou- 
sand discoveries of incalculable utility. 

That the Great Disposer of Events may 
inspire the learned and benevolent to 
pursue this hint, is the fervent prayer 
of 
Humanus.
