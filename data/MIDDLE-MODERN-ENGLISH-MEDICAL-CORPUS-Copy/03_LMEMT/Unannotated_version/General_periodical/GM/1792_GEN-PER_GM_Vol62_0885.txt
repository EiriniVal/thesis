Mr. Urban, 
Oct. 3. 

I FEEL most sensibly for a Medical 
Sufferer, p. 804; and I think it my 
duty to tell him what cured me of the 
small worms he complains of. 

Until I was sixteen, I was continually 
troubled with them, and they seemed 
to increase with my years. I went to 
Harrowgate, and at certain periods 
drank many hogsheads of that nauseous 
water, besides being half-poisoned with 
other medicines. In short, I was com- 
paratively as thin as the tapers that 
preyed upon me, and of the same co- 
lour. A consumption was thought un- 
avoidable; and the itching I under- 
went made me look upon death as an 
expected relief. Whether there was a 
turn in my constitution that induced the 
efforts of Nature to expel my numerous 
enemies, or the receipt my parents got 
from an old lady of eighty, performed 
the cure, I leave the faculty to judge; 
I have always thought the latter; and I 
remember with gratitude the fine old 
woman as the restorer of life. 

Towards evening I had a clyster gi- 
ven me of warm milk and honey; it 
was suffered to remain some time; and 
I had then another given of strong de- 
coction of wormwood, rue, and other 
bitter garden-herbs. These were often 
repeated, until I found the itching 
cease; and my stools, after the second 
clyster, were full of worms. Health 
soon gave life to my countenance; I 
have never had one of the little enemies 
since; and I have passed through many 
years of military toil without a day's 
illness. 

I have always attributed my cure to 
this easy receipt; and I should be very 
glad if any of the numerous worm-suf- 
ferers should reap advantage from it. I 
hope I may not be deemed indelicate 
for using plain English; I do it that I 
may be understood by every one; at 
any rate, the experiment will be found 
to do no harm.
