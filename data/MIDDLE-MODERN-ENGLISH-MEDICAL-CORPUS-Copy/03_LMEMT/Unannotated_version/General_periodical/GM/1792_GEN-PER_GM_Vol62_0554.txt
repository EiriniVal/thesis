[}133. An Analysis of the New London Pharma- 
copœia; explaining the Nature, Principles, 
Uses, and Doses, of the Preparations, &c. for 
the Use of the junior Students. By Robert 
White, M. D. }]
A HINT was some months since 
given by a correspondent on the neces- 
sity there was for a concise and familiar 
explanation of the preparations and 
compositions contained in the New 
London Pharmacopœia; and it gives 
us pleasure to find that the business has 
been taken up by Dr. W. in a manner 
suitable to the occasion. In this book 
the junior part of the profession will 
meet with an easy introduction to the 
nature and qualities of the several pre- 
scripts, the principles of which are sel- 
dom attended to so early as they ought 
to be.
