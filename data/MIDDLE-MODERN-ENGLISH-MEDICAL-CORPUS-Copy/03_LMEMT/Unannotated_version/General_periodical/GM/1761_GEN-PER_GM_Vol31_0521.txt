Mr Urban, 

A Sailor, of about 25 years of age, 
whose horse had run away with 
him, endeavouring to dismount whilst 
on a full gallop, threw his right leg 
over the horse's head, and sliding 
down his side, was struck so forcibly 
on the left thigh by the near hind foot, 
as to cause a dislocation of the thigh- 
bone. Being sent for, I got him laid 
on his back on a bed, with his right 
thigh and leg duly extended: On 
comparing the limbs, I easily saw the 
defect; for, near the spine of the Os 
illium, there was an unusual swelling, 
which, by my feeling, and the patient's 
agony, together with the shortness of 
the limb, an inability of motioin, and 
the knee and foot being inverted, I 
judged could be nothing else than the 
head of the Os femoris; and finding 
the accident to be quite recent, had 
recourse to the following operations: 

As the patient lay near the edge of 
the bed, I placed a strong man at his 
left side, with his back to the bed's 
head, his left hand passed under the 
patient's buttock, and was met and 
grasped by the right hand so as to 
prevent the patient from sliding when 
the extension should be made; then 
taking a very long towel, I tied it once 
round the patient's knee, and giving 
its ends to two assistants, bid them 
draw gradually, and both together; 
whilst I (seated on the patient's left 
side, my face to his, my left hand on 
his knee, and my right hand near the 
great trochanter) when a due extension 
was made, guided the bone, and, by 
one push, was so happy as to replace 
it, which was confirmed by the sound 
it made, the patient's immediate re- 
lief from his agony, and the equality 
of this limb with the other. I then 
embrocated the whole joint, applied a 
roller, bled the patient in the opposite 
arm, and recommended rest: The 
next day I took off the roller, and, re- 
newing the embrocation, rolled it up 
again. Next morning, to my great 
surprize, I was told my patient was 
walked out; and at night, blaming 
him for his rash and indiscreet beha- 
|P_522
viour, he told me he could walk as 
well as ever; and, luckily for him, 
no tumour, inflammation, or other 
bad symptom followed; and he soon 
after went to sea. 

This happened shortly before your 
publication of the Article LXV. of the 
Philosophical Transactions epitomized, in 
your Magazine for September last; and 
which being followed by the Article 
LXXV. in October following, deter- 
mined me, by the channel of your use- 
ful Magazine, to communicate to the 
public the above case, as similar to, 
and more recent, than those in the 
Philosophical Transactions; and to which, 
if you please to give a place, you may 
possibly oblige some others, as well as, 

Your constant Reader and Admirer, 
Rooke Thorold, Surgeon. 

West Cowes, Isle of Wight, Nov. 18.
