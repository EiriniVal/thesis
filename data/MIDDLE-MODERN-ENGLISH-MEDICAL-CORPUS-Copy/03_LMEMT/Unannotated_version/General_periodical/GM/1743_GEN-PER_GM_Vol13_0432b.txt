|P_432
The same excellent Author introduces a 
Caution, unexpected in such a Work, a- 
gainst the pernicious Use of Spiritu- 
ous Liquors. As we think it cannot 
be made too publick, we shall take the Li- 
berty to quote the Passage. 

AS things now go in the World 
(says he) there will in a little Time 
be no Occasion to use Means to increase 
the Quantity of Corn, since the Num- 
ber of the People who are to eat it, 
daily decreases, either by the untimely 
Death of Multitudes, whose Vitals are 
destroyed by these hot caustick burning 
Spirits, or on account of great Num- 
bers, whose Stomachs are thereby so 
depraved that they can eat little or no- 
thing, to the great Detriment of the 
landed Interest.â€” 

It will be a great Satisfaction to me if 
|P_433
these things shall prove beneficial to 
those numerous and valuable Persons, who 
occupy their Business in great Waters: 
And oh! that I could prevail with them 
to be so true to their own Interest 
as not to destroy their Health, and 
shorten their Lives, by the intemperate 
Use of distill'd Spirituous Liquors; for 
tho' dangerous Sicknesses are often oc- 
casioned by the very noxious, rancid 
close Air in Ships: Yet the Numbers 
of those who lose their Lives by this, 
and all other Dangers and Difficulties 
they are exposed to, is small, in Com- 
parison of the vast Multitudes that are 
destroyed by these pernicious Liquors, 
especially in hot Climates.
