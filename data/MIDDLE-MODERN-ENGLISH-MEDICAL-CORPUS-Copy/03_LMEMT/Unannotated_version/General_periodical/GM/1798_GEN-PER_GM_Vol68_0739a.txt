Mr. Urban, 
Sept. 8. 

KNOWING the cause of diseases 
is generally reputed the first step 
to the cure. Take a short preventive 
to autumnal rheumatisms. Abolish 
and turn out of doors bright and po- 
lished stoves; and, when the weather 
is cold, approach to the fire. There 
is not a more useful document for 
health to the inhabitants of this cli- 
mate than "Follow your feelings."

Ward's White Drop, mentioned 
p. 647, is a good, cheap, and useful, 
medicine in most cases where recom- 
mended. It is an antiscorbutic, and 
purifier of the blood. It may be con- 
tinued six weeks or two months: 
Spring and Autumn the proper times: 
temperate regimen, avoiding severity 
of cold or wet, necessary at the time. 
Delicate constitutions cannot bear it. 
It has had its day of fashion, but now 
obsolete, requiring in the administra- 
tion of it no medical assistant. It is 
out of the recollection of faculty men. 
Your correspondent Homo does ser- 
vice to the publick in bringing it for- 
ward to revive the use of it. Unsuc- 
cessful patients by usual remedies, can- 
not do better than resort to it. 

Yours, &c. V. and B.
