[}The old English Way of Living. }]
AN old Gentleman, near 90, 
who has a florid and vigorous 
Constitution, tells us the difference 
between the Manners of the present 
Age, and that in which he spent 
his Youth. With regard to eating
in his time, Breakfast consisted of 
good Hams, cold Sirloins, and good 
Beer, succeeded with wholsome Ex- 
ercise, which sent them home hun- 
gry, and ready for Dinner, made 
up of plain Meats, dress'd after a 
plain manner; Suppers were but 
slight Meals; and good Hours then 
in Fashion: Men of Quality were 
stirring at the same Hour that raises 
a modern Tradesman; and their 
Ladies were better Huswifes than 
most of Our Farmer's Daughters. 

That the present Elegance in eat- 
ing, and the neglect of good Hours, 
is productive of Intemperance, and 
tends to the decay not only of the 
Strength, but the Capacities of el- 
derly People. Whereas the good 
old Way of living preserved the 
Vigour and Faculties to a good old 
Age; of which gives an instance of 
Mr. Waller, who sat in the Parlia- 
ments both of James I. and James II.
