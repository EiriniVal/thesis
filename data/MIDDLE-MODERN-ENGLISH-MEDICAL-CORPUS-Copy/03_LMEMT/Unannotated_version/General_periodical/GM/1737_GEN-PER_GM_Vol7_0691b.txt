[}A Receipt for the Bite of a Mad Dog, 
communicated by a French Gentleman, 
who says it is infallible, and that 
he has seen it often try'd in France, 
even on Persons condemn'd to be smother- 
ed between Feather-Beds, and never 
knew it fail of Success. }]
TAKE the Shells of Male Oysters, 
and calcine the white or inner Part 
of them; when thoroughly calcin'd, 
which may be done either in an Oven 
or a Crucible, beat them to a fine 
Powder in a Mortar, and fist it thro' 
a fine Sieve, which done, put [/1./]six Gros 
of the Powder into a Pint of right 
neat White-wine, and let the Patient 
drink it off, without taking any other 
Thing, of any kind whatever, until at 
least three Hours afterwards; and by 
all Means not to touch Butter, or any 
thing that is oily, during the Time of 
Cure. The next Day he must take 
four Gros of the same Powder in the 
aforesaid Quantity of Wine, and the 
third Day two Gros, still fasting three 
Hours afterwards, and then the Cure 
is compleated.

* Eight Gros make a French Ounce, 
which our Apothecaries know how to ad- 
just to their own.
