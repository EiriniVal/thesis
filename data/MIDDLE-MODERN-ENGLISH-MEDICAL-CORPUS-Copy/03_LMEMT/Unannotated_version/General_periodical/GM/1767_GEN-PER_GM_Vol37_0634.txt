SIR, 
Threadneedle-str.Dec. 26, 1767. 

THE letters of the sensible and 
humane Mr. Hanway, which 
have lately been published, in regard 
to the practice of inoculation for the 
small pox, remind me of some con- 
versation which passed in a public 
company, where I was present, about 
two years since, on the same subject; 
the purport of which was, as near as 
my memory retains it, as follows. 
The great success attending the prac- 
tice; not one in many hundreds dying 
under the operation, the ease and 
pleasure it gave to those who were 
inoculated, and their families and re- 
lations, and the happiness they enjoy 
in being able to go without fear of 
contracting that dangerous and dis- 
agreeable distemper, into all places 
and on all occasions, and the many 
valuable lives which are thereby pre- 
|P_635
served to the community, were all 
urged in its favour. 

To all which a gentleman present 
replied, that, although the apparent
success is very great, it might be 
doubted, if much of it was not ima- 
ginary, seeing that although the num- 
ber of deaths under inoculation are 
very inconsiderable, yet within his 
knowledge, they were more than was 
generally allowed, several valuable 
lives, of which he gave some instances, 
having been lost thereby, and those 
of such who otherwise might never 
have had the distemper, and been pre- 
served many years to the community; 
that some he feared, and those not a 
few, of which he also gave some in- 
stances, were left in a state of health 
worse than death, by the operation 
having been performed on improper 
subjects, or by unskilful hands; in 
short, it appeared to him, that how- 
ever beneficial inoculation might be 
to particulars, yet on the whole, it 
is the most pernicious contrivance as 
ever was found out to destroy man- 
kind; and what confirmed him in his 
opinion, and was more to be depend- 
ed on than any reasoning from obser- 
vations, however impartially and care- 
fully made, he said, was a fact col- 
lected from the bills of mortality in 
London, from which it appears, that, 
taking an average of the thirty- 
eight years next before, and the 
thirty-eight years next after the prac- 
tice was introduced, and comparing 
them together, where three died of that 
distemper before, four had died since; 
and he said it could not be doubted 
that, if the number of deaths by that 
distemper were increased to that de- 
gree in London, the increase must have 
been much greater, and the mischief 
more fatal in the country at large, 
many considerable districts of which, 
formerly knew little of the small pox, 
but its name, and it seldom became 
rife, except in large towns, and in 
them not above once in fifteen or 
twenty years, and then by due care 
it was generally confined to those pla- 
ces. He said it must be confessed that 
the mischiefs he had mentioned, might 
happen chiefly, if not wholly, for want 
of a law to oblige those who are ino- 
culated, to keep themselves shut up 
for a proper time, as they and the 
inoculators are continually mixing 
indiscriminately in all companies, and 
thereby spread the infection to a great 
degree, and communicate the disorder 
to many, who would not in all pro- 
bability, otherwise ever have the dis- 
ease. And he concluded with say- 
ing, that he was fully persuaded, that 
no war, sickness, or emigration, had 
ever been so destructive to the popu- 
lation of this kingdom, as inoculation 
for the small pox had already been, 
and would continue to be, if the 
legislature should not think fit to in- 
terfere and prescribe, at least, how 
long the patient should be secluded 
from the uninfected; if not also at 
what time of the year only the practice 
should be allowed. To this it was 
answered, that allowing the fact of 
the increase of deaths to be as he 
asserted, it did not, by his own con- 
fession, hold against the practice in 
general, but only against the present 
method of proceeding; but it was 
hoped he was mistaken as to the fact 
itself; if not, it must be allowed to 
be a matter deserving a very serious 
consideration; he admitted his argu- 
ment lay, and was meant by him on- 
ly against the present method: saying 
he was fully convinced that inoculation, 
which, in his opinion, under the pre- 
sent management was so great an evil, 
would under a due regulation, be the 
greatest good: but as to his fact, he 
said he had no doubt about it, and pro- 
duced a card whereon the births and 
deaths distinguishing the deaths by the 
small pox, were stated from the bills of 
mortality from 1683 to 1720, when 
inoculation began to be used; and 
from 1721 to 1758, the thirty-eight 
years next after the introduction there- 
of; and by the comparison, it ap- 
peared to be as he inferred. On the 
card was a reference to your Maga- 
zine of July 1764 p. 332, from whence 
I find the calculations are taken.â€” 
You need not doubt, Sir, how much 
many of us were astonished at what 
was said, but another gentleman pre- 
sent assuring us, that since the present 
Operators had appeared, the case 
was quite altered, he having been 
assured by the most eminent of them 
all, that the infection under his me- 
thod could not be communicated ei- 
ther by his patients or himself and 
remarked, that the comparison ended 
in the year 1758, then seven years 
ago; this made me continue the ac- 
count down to this time in the same 
manner, and am sorry to find the e- 
vil goes on increasing, and could wish 
that some remedy were applied. Be 
pleased therefore to lay this matter 
before those in power, by publishing 
these papers in your Supplement for 
1767, and you will oblige, 

Yours, &c. A. M.
