43. The Description and Characters of the dif- 
ferent Diseases of the human Body. To which 
is added, and Arrangement of the Medicines 
and Preparations in the London Pharmaco- 
p√¶ia, according to their respective Virtues, 
being the first Volume of the Franklinian Im- 
provement of Medicine, or an Attempt, ac- 
cording to Dr. Franklin's Predictions, to esta- 
blish the Means of rendering Sickness and Dis- 
ease less injurious, dangerous, and fatal, to 
Health, and thus of causing old Age to be 
again natural to Man. By George Edwards, 
Esq. M. D. Author of The Aggrandisement 
of Great Britain, The National Perfec- 
tion of Finance, The Royal Regeneration 
of Great Britain,  and The Discovery of 
the Eighteenth Century. }]
THIS is announced by the author as 
the commencement of his grand scheme 
of a general reformation in the three 
great branches of humanity, as he calls 
them, agriculture, mental civilization, 
and the science of physic. But for a 
compleat delineation of his plan for the 
improvement of medicine, we must wait 
the publication of the second part of this 
work, the Doctor's time not affording 
him an opportunity of offering that 
elaborate, minute, and adequate, ex- 
planation he intended.  We shall, 
therefore, decline entering into a parti- 
cular examination of this, until we have 
the whole scheme before us; and for 
the present content ourselves with wish- 
ing the author that success which his 
zeal and philanthropy so evidently en- 
title him to.
