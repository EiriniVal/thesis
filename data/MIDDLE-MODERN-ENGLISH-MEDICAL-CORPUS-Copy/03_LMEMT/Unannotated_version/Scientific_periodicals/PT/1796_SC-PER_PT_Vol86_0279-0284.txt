[}XI. Of the Influence of Cold upon the Health of the Inhabitants of 
London. By William Heberden Jun. M. D. F. R. S. }]
Read March 10, 1796. 

The extraordinary mildness of last January, compared with 
the unusual severity of the January preceding, affords a pecu- 
liarly favourable opportunity of observing the effect of each of 
these seasons contrasted with each other. For of these two 
successive winters, one has been the coldest, and the other 
the warmest, of which any regular account has ever been kept 
in this country. Nor is this by any means an idle speculation, 
or matter of mere curiosity; for one of the first steps towards 
preserving the health of our fellow-creatures, is to point out 
the sources from which diseases are to be apprehended. And 
what may make the present inquiry more particularly useful, 
is that the result, as I hope clearly to make appear by the 
following statements, is entirely contrary to the prejudices 
usually entertained upon this subject. 

|P_280
During last January, nothing was more common than to 
hear expressions of the unseasonableness of the weather; and 
fears lest the want of the usual degree of cold, should be pro- 
ductive of putrid diseases, and I know not what other causes 
of mortality. On the other hand, "a bracing cold " and "a 
clear frost, " are familiar in the mouth of every Englishman; 
and what he is taught to wish for, as among the greatest 
promoters of health and vigour. 

Whatever deference be due to received opinions, it appears to 
me however from the strongest evidence, that the prejudices 
of the world are upon this point at least unfounded. The 
average degrees of heat upon Fahrenheit's thermometer 
kept in London during the month of January 1795, was 23° in the 
morning, and 29°.4 in the afternoon. The average in January 
1796, was 43°.5 in the morning, and 50°.1 in the afternoon. A 
difference of above twenty degrees! And if we turn our atten- 
tion from the comparative coldness of these months, to the 
corresponding healthiness of each, collected from the weekly 
bills of mortality, we shall find the result no less remarkable. 
For in five weeks between the 31st of December 1794 and 
the 3d of February 1795, the whole number of burials 
amounted to 2823; and in an equal period of five weeks 
between the 30th of December 1795 and the 2d of February 
1796, to 1471. So that the excess of the mortality in January 
1795 above that of January 1796, was less than of 1352 
persons. A number sufficient surely to awaken the attention 
of the most prejudiced admirers of a frosty winter. And 
though I have only stated the evidence of two years, the same 
conclusion may universally be drawn; as I have learned from 
a careful examination of the weekly bills of mortality for 
|P_281
many years. These two seasons were choosen as being each of 
them very remarkable, and in immediate succession one to the 
other, and in every body's recollection. 

It may not be impertinent to the objects of this Society, 
without entering too much into the province of medicine, to 
consider a little more particularly the several ways in which 
this effect may be supposed to be produced; and to point out 
some of the principal injuries which people are liable to sustain 
in their health from a severe frost. And one of the first things 
that must strike every mind engaged in this investigation, is 
its effect on old people. It is curious to observe among those 
who are said in the bills to die above 60 years of age, how re- 
gularly the tide of mortality follows the influence of this pre- 
vailing cause: so that a person used to such inquiries, may 
form no contemptible judgment of the severity of any of our 
winter months, merely by attending to this circumstance. 
Thus their number last January was not much above 1/5th of 
what it had been in the same month of the year before. The 
article of asthma, as might be expected, is prodigiously in- 
creased, and perhaps includes no inconsiderable part of the 
mortality of the aged. After these come apoplexies and pal- 
sies, fevers, consumptions, and dropsies. Under the two last 
of which are contained a large proportion of the chronical 
diseases of the country; all which seem to be hurried on to 
a premature termination. The whole will most readily be 
seen at one view in the following table.

Notwithstanding the plague, the remittent fever, the dysen- 
tery, and the scurvy, have so decreased, that their very name 
is almost unknown in London; yet there has, I know not 
how, arisen a prejudice concerning putrid diseases, which seems 
to have made people more and more apprehensive of them, as 
the danger has been growing less. It must in great measure 
be attributed to this, that the consumption of Peruvian bark 
|P_283
in this country has, within the last fifty years, increased from 
14,000 to above 100,000 pounds annually. And the same 
cause has probably contributed, from a mistaken mode of rea- 
soning, to prepossess people with the idea of the wholesome- 
ness of a hard frost. But it has in another place [/1./] been very 
ably demonstrated that a long frost is eventually productive 
of the worst putrid fevers that are at this time known in Lon- 
don; and that heat does in fact prove a real preventive against 
that disease. And although this may be said to be a very re- 
mote effect of the cold, it is not therefore the less real in its 
influence upon the mortality of London. Accordingly a com- 
parison of the numbers in the foregoing table will shew that 
very nearly twice as many persons died of fevers in January 
1795, as did in the corresponding month of this year. I might 
go on to observe that the true scurvy was last year generated 
in the metropolis from the same causes extended to an unusual 
length. But these are by no means the only ways, nor indeed 
do they seem to be the principal ways, in which a frost ope- 
rates to the destruction of great numbers of people. The 
poor, as they are worse protected from the weather, so are 
they of course the greatest sufferers by its inclemency. But 
every physician in London, and every apothecary, can add 
his testimony, that their business among all ranks of people 
never fails to increase, and to decrease, with the frost. For 
if there be any whose lungs are tender, any whose constitu- 
tion has been impaired either by age, or by intemperance, or 
by disease; he will be very liable to have all his complaints 
increased, and all his infirmities aggravated by such a season. 
Nor must the young and active think themselves quite secure, 
|P_284
or fancy their health will be confirmed by imprudently ex- 
posing themselves. The stoutest man may meet with impe- 
diments to his recovery from accidents otherwise inconsider- 
able; or may contract inflammations, or coughs, and lay the 
foundation of the severest ills. In a country where the pre- 
vailing complaints among all orders of people are colds, coughs, 
consumptions, and rheumatisms, no prudent man can surely 
suppose that unnecessary exposure to an inclement sky; that 
priding oneself upon going without any additional clothing 
in the severest winter; that inuring oneself to be hardy, at a 
time that demands our cherishing the firmest constitution lest 
it suffer; that braving the winds, and challenging the rudest 
efforts of the season, can ever be generally useful to English- 
men. But if generally, and upon the whole, it be inexpedient, 
then ought every one for himself to take care that he be not 
the sufferer. For many doctrines very importantly erroneous; 
many remedies either vain, or even noxious, are daily imposed 
upon the world for want of attention to this great truth; that 
it is from general effects only, and those founded upon exten- 
sive experience, that any maxim to which each individual may 
with confidence defer, can possibly be established.
