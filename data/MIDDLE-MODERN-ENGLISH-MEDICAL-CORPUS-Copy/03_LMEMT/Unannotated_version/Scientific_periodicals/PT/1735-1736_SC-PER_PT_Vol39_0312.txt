[}V. Part of a Letter from William Burton, 
M. D. at Windsor, to C. Mortimer, 
R. S. Secr. concerning the Viper-catch- 
ers, and their Remedy for the Bite of 
a Viper. }]
SIR, 
Windsor, May 24, 1734. 

THE Bearer of this, William Oliver, and his 
Wife, called upon me last Week with their 
Vipers, and either of them offered to be bit by any 
Viper, and to suffer their Arm to swell for some Time; 
and then, by the external Application of a common 
cheap Remedy, in a few Hours to remove all the 
Symptoms. The Experiment was made last Wednes- 
day in our Town-Hall, before Dr. Derham, F. R. S. 
Dr. Waterland, the Physicians, Apothecaries, and Chi- 
rurgeons of this Town, and many other Gentlemen 
of this Neighbourhood. He was bit in the upper 
Joint of the Thumb, and higher up on the same Arm, 
by two different fresh Vipers: His Thumb, Hand 
and Arm soon after swelled much, and all the usual 
Symptoms of a Viper-bite followed; he applied the 
Remedy [Sallad-Oil] before us, with the promised 
Success: But all the Contributors engaged not to di- 
vulge the Remedy *** 

Yours, &c. 
William Burton.
