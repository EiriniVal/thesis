[}VI. An Account of a Case in which the upper 
Head of the Os Humeri was sawed off, a 
large Portion of the bone afterwards ex- 
foliated, and yet the entire Motion of the 
Limb was preserved. By Mr. White, 
Surgeon, at Manchester. Communicated 
by Mr. Watson, F. R. S. }]
[/1./]EDMUND POLLIT, of 
Sterling, near Cockey Moor, in 
this county, aged 16, of a scrophulous habit of body, 
was admitted into the Manchester infirmary, April 
6, 1768. The account I received with him was, 
that he had been suddenly seized, about a fortnight 
before, with a violent inflammation in his left shoul- 
der, which threatened a mortification, but at last 
terminated in a large abscess, which was opened with 
a lancet a few days before his admission. The ori- 
fice was situated near the axilla, upon the lower edge 
of the pectoralis major; and through it, I could di- 
stinctly feel the head of the os humeri totally divested 
of its bursal ligament. The matter, which was very 
offensive, and in great quantity, had made its way 
down to the middle of the humerus, and had likewise 
burst out at another orifice just below the processus 
acromion; through which the head of the os humeri
might easily be seen. The whole arm and hand were 
|P_40
swelled to twice their natural size, and were entirely 
useless to him; he suffered much pain, and the ab- 
sorption of the matter had brought on hectic sym- 
ptoms, such as, night-sweats, diarrh√¶a, quick pulse, 
and loss of appetite, which had extremely emaciated 
him. 

Under these very dangerous circumstances, there 
seemed no resource but from an operation. The 
common one in these cases, that of taking off the arm 
at the articulation with the scapula, appeared dreadful 
both in the first instance and in its consequences. I 
therefore proposed the following operation, from 
which I expected many advantages; and performed 
it on the 14th of the same month. 

I began my incision at that orifice which was si- 
tuated just below the processus acromion, and carried it 
down to the middle of the humerus, by which all the 
subjacent bone was brought into view. I then took 
hold of the patient's elbow, and easily forced the 
head of the humerus out of its socket, and brought it 
so entirely out of the wound, that I readily grasped 
the whole head in my left hand, and held it there till 
I had sawn it off (see Tab. I. Fig. 1.), with a com- 
mon amputation-saw, having first applied a paste- 
board card betwixt the bones and the skin. I had 
taken the precaution of placing an assistant on whom 
I could depend, with a compress just above the cla- 
vicle, to stop the circulation in the artery, if I should 
have the misfortune to cut or lacerate it; but no acci- 
dent of any kind happened, and the patient did not 
lose more than two or three ounces of blood, only a 
small artery which partly surrounds the joint being 
wounded, which was easily secured. 

|P_41
He was remarkably easy after the operation, and 
rested well that night; the discharge diminished 
every day, the swelling gradually abated, his appetite 
returned, and all his hectic symptoms vanished. In 
about five or six weeks, I perceived the parts, from 
which the bone had been taken, had acquired a con- 
siderable degree of firmness, and he was able to lift a 
pretty large weight in his hand. At the end of two 
months, I found that a large piece of the whole sub- 
stance of the bone, that had been denuded by the mat- 
ter, and afterwards exposed to the air, was now 
ready to separate from the sound, and with a pair of 
forceps I easily removed it (Fig. II.). After this ex- 
foliation, the wound healed very fast; and on August 
15th he was discharged perfectly cured. On com- 
paring this arm with the other, it was not quite an 
inch shorter; he has the perfect use of it, and can not 
only elevate his arm to any height, but can likewise 
perform the rotatory motion as well as ever. The 
figure of the arm is no ways altered; and from the 
use he has of it, from its appearance to the eye, and 
to the touch, I think I may safely say, the head, 
neck, and part of the body of the os humeri are ac- 
tually regenerated. 

I did not make use of any splints, machine, or 
bandage, during the cure, to confine the limb strictly 
in one certain situation, nor was his arm ever dressed 
in bed, but sitting in a chair, and, as soon as he 
could bear it, standing up, with his body leaning for- 
wards, to give room for applying the bandages, which 
were no more than just necessary to retain the dres- 
sings; and to this method I attribute the preservation 
of the motion of the joint, which could not have 
|P_42
been so well effected any other way; but the joint, 
in all probability, would have remained stiff, and 
formed an anchylosis, if it had not been allowed to play 
about. 

[}REMARKS. }]
Though from this operation I hoped for many 
advantages preferable to the amputation of the limb 
at the scapula, yet my most sanguine expectations 
fell greatly short of the success attending it. I did 
not flatter myself with the hopes of a moveable joint, 
or that the length of the limb would be so nearly 
preserved, when there was a loss of above four inches 
of the whole substance of the bone without any 
other bone to support it as in the leg and fore-arm; 
and where the dreadful condition of the arm at the 
time of the operation prevented me from making use 
of any machine to keep it extended [/2./]. But I sup- 
pose the weight of the arm was in this case in some 
measure sufficient to counterbalance the contractile 
power of the muscles, for his arm was only suspended 
by a common sling, and the patient not at all con- 
fined to his bed. 

I could not help being surprized to find so much 
strength and firmness in the parts as evidently shewed 
a regeneration of the bone before the lower part had 
|P_43
exfoliated, or even before it had begun to loosen. 
This osseous matter could not proceed from the sca- 
pula, the glenoid cavity of that bone not being di- 
vested of its cartilage; could it then possibly escape 
from the end of the sound bone, before the morbid 
part had begun to separate from it? or are there any 
vessels that could convey the bony matter, and deposit 
it in the place of what had been removed [/3./]? These 
are points that I will not pretend to decide absolutely, 
but I am much inclined to the latter opinion [/4./]. 

|P_44
Is it not probable that there is a regeneration of the 
cartilage as well as the bone? for it is well known to 
every-body conversant in anatomy, that the ends of 
some bones, which are joined to no others, are co- 
vered with cartilages; but these are never wanting on 
the ends, and in the cavities of such bones as are de- 
signed for motion; and I cannot see in this case how 
the motion could be preserved so complete without a 
cartilage; and indeed without a bursal ligament, or 
something analogous to it, to contain the synovia, and 
keep the bone in its place. 

As this is the first operation of the kind that has 
been performed, or at least made public, I thought 
the relation of it might possibly conduce to the im- 
provement of the art. That ingenious surgeon, Mr. 
Gooch, has indeed related three instances of the heads 
of bones being sawed off in compound luxations. In 
one of these cases the lower heads of the tibia and 
fibula were sawn off, in another that of the radius, 
and in the third that of the second bone of the thumb; 
but these were, in many respects, different from the 
present case. 

I believe it will seldom happen that this operation 
will not be greatly preferable to the amputation of the 
arm at the scapula, as this last is generally performed 
for a caries of the upper head of the os humeri; and 
as the preservation of a limb is always of the utmost 
consequence, and what every surgeon of the least hu- 
manity would at all times wish for, but particularly 
where (as in this case) the whole limb and its actions 
are preserved entire, the cure no ways protracted, and 
the danger of the operation most undoubtedly less. 
For though amputation is often indispensably neces- 
|P_45
sary, and frequently attended with little danger or 
inconvenience when only part of a limb is removed; 
yet where the whole is lost, the danger is greatly in- 
creased, and the loss irreparable. 

I have frequently performed this operation on dead 
subjects, and where the parts had not been diseased, 
and never found any difficulty; and from the dissec- 
tion of the parts had no reason to doubt of success in 
a living subject, where the ligaments and muscles are 
more supple, and the matter, by insinuating itself be- 
twixt the bone and integuments, has made less dissec- 
tion necessary. 

I have likewise, in a dead subject, made an incision 
on the external side of the hip joint, and continued the 
incision down below the great trochanter, then cutting 
through the bursal ligament, and bringing the knee 
inwards, the upper head of the os femoris was forced 
out of its socket, and easily sawed off; and I have no 
doubt but this operation might be performed upon a 
living subject with great prospect of success. 

The Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris proposed 
for a prize question, Whether amputation of the 
thigh at its articulation with the os innominatum was 
ever adviseable: but was I under a necessity of per- 
forming this operation, or that which I have been 
describing, I should not hesitate a moment which to 
prefer.

* After the extraction of three inches and ten lines of the os 
humeri, M. Le Cat made use of a machine to keep the upper 
and lower pieces of the bone at their proper distances. He has 
given a description of the case, and a figure of the machine, in 
vol. LVI. of the Philos. Transact. p. 270.

* Mr. Gooch, in his volume of Cases and Practical Remarks, 
relating the case of a compound fracture of the leg, where a very 
considerable portion of the tibia was sawed off, says, In about 
three weeks I was sensible, as were also several surgeons whom 
curiosity led to see so uncommon a case, that the substance 
which grew in the space of five inches entirely void of bone, 
had acquired in the middle only a greater degree of solidity 
than flesh; which circumstance not agreeing with the general 
received notion of the generation of callus, we proved beyond 
dispute, with a sharp pointed instrument, and we observed that 
the ossification was gradually formed from that central point, 
which was considerably advanced before any exfoliation was 
cast off the ends of the divided bone. In less than four 
months, the whole space was so well supplied with the callus, 
or rather new bone, that he was able to raise his leg when the 
bandage was off, without its bending.
