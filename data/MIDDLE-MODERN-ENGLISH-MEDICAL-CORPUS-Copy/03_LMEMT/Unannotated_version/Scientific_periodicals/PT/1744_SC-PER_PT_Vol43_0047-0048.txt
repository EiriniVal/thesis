[}IV. A Letter from Mr. Chr. Warren, Sur- 
geon at Truro in Cornwall, to John 
Machin, Esq; Secr. R. S. Prof. Astr. 
Gresham. containing further Accounts of the 
Success of injecting medicated Liquors into 
the Abdomen, in the Case of an Ascites. }]
SIR, 

[/1./]I BEG Leave to return my best Thanks 
to the Society in general, and to you, 
Sir, in particular, for their unanimous Thanks to 
me, and their Approbation of what I communicated 
to them in relation to Jane Roman[/2./], whom I tapp'd 
and injected for a Dropsy, and yet remains in statu 
quo; tho' she inform'd me Yesterday, that she had 
labour'd under a Tertian Ague ever since last Janu- 
ary: Indeed I should not wonder, if, after Nineteen 
Months Space, she should want the same Operation 
again, in a Country where Poison [a Dram] is ha- 
bitually become the common Nutriment, Physician, 
and Counsellor on all Occasions. 

Your kind Communication of Dr. Hales's judicious 
Remarks and Improvement on my Discovery [/3./], does 
me great Honour and Pleasure; and the more so, as 
I was so happy as to have discover'd the Use and 
Efficacy of Injections by means of one Puncture only, 
on a poor Woman, about Ten Days before I received 
yours; from whom I drew near fifty Pints of drop- 
sical Lymph, by an easy Transmutation thereof into 
|P_48
an appropriated medicinal Fluid; which was, with- 
out any Difficulty, retain'd within the Cavity near 
two Hours, and, at the Close of the Operation, drawn 
all off at once, without the least Symptom of a Syn- 
cope from Inanition; of which I shall beg Leave to 
acquaint you further, when I see how she holds it, 
as well as of what else remarkable may occur in the 
Course of my Practice. I am, with the greatest Re- 
gard to the Learned, Worthy Gentlemen of the 
Royal Society, 
Truro, May 12. 
1744. 

SIR, 
Your most obliged, 
and obedient humble Servant, 
Chr. Warwick.
