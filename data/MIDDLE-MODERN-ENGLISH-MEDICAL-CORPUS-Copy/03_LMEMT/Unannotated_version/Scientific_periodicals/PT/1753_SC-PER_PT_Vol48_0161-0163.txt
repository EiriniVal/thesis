[}XXIV. A Description of a new Method of 
opening the Cornea, in order to extract the 
crystalline Humour; by Mr. Samuel Sharp, 
Surgeon to Guy's Hospital, and F. R. S. }]
[^An illustration of an eye and a scalpel, its blade crossing the eyeball horizontally. ^]
[/1./]THE operation of discharging the 
crystalline humour from the eye, 
for the cure of that species of blindness call'd a cata- 
ract, was a few years since invented by Mons. Daviel, 
who has perform'd it on great numbers of patients, and 
continues still to practise it with remarkable success, 
as I have lately learned from unquestionable au- 
thority [/2./]. Supposing it therefore admitted, that the 
extraction of the crystalline humour has been found 
by experience to be a useful method of cure, I here 
take the liberty of laying before the Society a new 
manner of making the incision of the cornea, by 
by which, I flatter myself, Mons. Daviel's operation 
will be very much shorten'd, the patient will suffer 
less pain, and every skilful operator will be equal to 
the undertaking. 

|P_162
Place the patient in the same situation as for couch- 
ing, either opening the eyelids with your fore-finger 
and thumb, or letting an assistant raise the upper eye- 
lid, whilst you yourself keep down the under eye- 
lid. Then, with a small knife, the figure of which is 
here represented, holding its edge downwards, make 
a puncture through the cornea near its circumference 
into the anterior chamber of the eye, in such a dire- 
ction, as to carry it horizontally, and opposite to the 
transverse diameter of the pupil: after which you are 
to pass it towards the nose, through the cornea from 
within outwards, as near to its circumference, as in 
the first puncture. 

When you have made the second puncture, push the 
extremity of the blade one seventh of an inch beyond 
the surface of the cornea, and immediately cut the 
cornea downwards, drawing the knife towards you 
as you make the incision. After this, you press 
gently with your thumb against the inferior part of 
the globe of the eye, in order to expel the cataract, 
and the operation finishes, according to the different 
circumstances, as in the manner proposed by Mons. 
Daviel. 

One extraordinary benefit seems to arise from the 
use of this single instrument, and perhaps from the 
shape of its blade, which increases in breadth all the 
way towards the handle: for, by this means, the 
punctures are so exactly fill'd up by the blade, that 
very little of the aqueous humour is discharged be- 
fore you begin to make the incision, and conse- 
quently during this time, the cornea preserves its 
convexity; whereas by using one instrument to punc- 
ture, and others to dilate, the cornea immediately 
|P_163
becomes flaccid, upon the issue of the aqueous hu- 
mour, and renders the operation tedious and embar- 
rassing, as I myself have found by experience in one 
patient, on whom I performed the incision of the 
cornea with a pair of scissars, as recommended by 
Mons. Daviel.
