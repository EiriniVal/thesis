[}XLV Observations on fungous Excrescences
of the Bladder; a cutting Forceps for ex- 
tirpating these Exrescences; and Canula's
for treating these Diseases; by M. Le Cat, 
F. R. S. Translated from the French by

[/1./]THE widow Néel, a farmer at Plein- 
bosc, in the parish of Etoutteville 
near Yvetot, had, for some years, felt pain in the 
small of the back, thighs, &c. In the year 1734, 
she had made bloody urine, and had one thigh and 
leg œdematous. These accidents having disappear'd, 
were succeeded by worse symptoms. She had fre- 
quent calls to make water, and did it often, a little 
at a time, and with pain, which was violent, parti- 
cularly after the urine was discharged: and this was 
of a dull red colour, that is, a little tinged with 
blood. 

All those of the profession, whom the patient con- 
sulted, assured her that she had the stone; and I was 
of the same opinion, but would not pronounce po- 
sitively, till I had search'd her; which I did the 17 
of October 1735. As soon as the sound was intro- 
duced, blood came away, and in greater quantity, 
the more I moved it about. The free play of the 
sound was obstructed: I found no stone, but pretty 
sure signs of excrescences in the obstruction of the 
sound, and the issue of blood, which its motion oc- 
casioned. However, by dint of management I found 
a situation of the sound, in which, by giving a little 
|P_293
jerk, I touch'd a hard body, the dull percussion of 
which convey'd nothing but obscurity to my hand or 
judgment. In order to come at the knowledge of 
this body, I passed the crooked sound destined for 
men, the bent of which I thought fitter to favour 
my inquiries. I found the same body again, but 
still with the same obscurity. I had extracted stones, 
which did not afford plainer marks of their existence; 
wherefore I judged, that there might be a stone and 
fungous excrescences too in this bladder; and that 
these excrescences were the obstacles that render'd 
our search difficult, and the stone doubtful. But the 
dull resistance which this hard body made, inclined 
me to think, that it might as well be some scirrhous 
tumour. These doubts held us a long time in sus- 
pense what party to take: but the extreme pain 
which the patient suffer'd, and the frequent hæmor- 
rhages, which must soon put an end to her life, made 
us determine to perform the operation; that is, to 
open the neck of the bladder, either to extract the 
stone, if any, or remove and treat the fungus's, 
which existed beyond all doubt. 

I cut this widow the 18 of October 1735, by 
what I call the rural apparatus, that is, without 
placing her upon the table used in our hospitals, 
which could not well be carried to the country 
where this woman dwelt. 

I placed her on the edge of her bed: a chair turn'd 
upside down supported her shoulders. Unknown to 
the patient I caused a board to be put under the 
first mattrass of this edge of the bed: and when she 
was placed on it, under her backside, or the os sacrum, 
I laid another board, on which I put a straw cushion 
|P_294
made compact and cover'd with linen-cloth. Two 
straps tied to the ends of this board were passed into 
the bars of the turn'd-up chair, which supported the 
patient's body: and these pieces, to wit, the chair 
and the board with the cushion were fastened toge- 
ther by buckles that were on the straps. The as- 
sistants, who were on each side of the patient, had 
each a strong large swathing band folded double, and 
pass'd into this fold in a slip-knot: at present I use 
one of those strong woollen sashes or girdles, with 
which couriers bind or swathe their body. This 
slip-knot was passed on the patient's wrists, who 
had seen nothing of these preparations, and she was 
bound fast, almost before she was aware of it. 
Then I introduced a common grooved staff, such as 
is used for abscesses of the bladder: I turn'd the 
groove towards the patient's left thigh, and on this 
groove I push'd my knife into the bladder; which 
knife is the same that I still use for women, but 
made a little narrower. On that knife, which had 
a groove, I slid the gorget and forceps in the usual 
manner. 

I searched for the stone, but in vain, I found no- 
thing but excrescences, one of which was consider- 
bly hard: I extracted several clusters of them with 
the forceps. Yet still I was not very certain, but 
that there might be a stone behind a rampart of ex- 
crescences which I felt; and I had not brought the 
crooked forceps with me to search behind this in- 
trenchment. When I judged that the patient was 
fatigued by my searchings, and the extirpations 
which I made with the forceps; I had her put to 
bed, after having put a canula into the wound, 
|P_295
contrary to my usual custom; but this case required 
it: these strange bodies were to be removed, if pos- 
sible; that organ must be injected, and consequently 
the canula was absolutely necessary. The patient, 
who bore the operation exceedingly well, was blooded 
two hours after it: she had a pretty good night, and 
was blooded again the next morning. I left one of 
my pupils with her, and return'd to Rouen. 

The canula, which I left in the wound, was of 
the common sort, and therefore too narrow to admit 
of searching in the diseased part, and to give issue to 
those excrescences, which we ought to endeavour to 
disengage and bring away in this treatment: besides, 
it is extremely difficult to make the canula remain 
in the wound. 

As soon as I got to Rouen, I order'd the canula 
(Plate IV. Fig. 1.) to be made; the advantages of 
which above the old one are: 

1. To afford a wider passage for the substances 
that are to be evacuated and introduced. 

2. To secure the instrument in the bladder, by 
its own structure chiefly, and particularly by the 
swelling at BB. 

3. The neck AA, which is at the basis of the 
swelling, is embraced by the neck of the bladder; 
whereby the surgeon may be sure, how much of the 
canula enters the bladder: and the openings CC, 
being immediately above the swelling B, are fixed at 
the lowest part of the bladder. 

Fig. 2, 3, 4, of the same plate represent the same 
canula as above described, but with further im- 
provements for cases, which require the evacuation 
of gross substances, the passage for which cannot 
|P_296
be too wide and direct. The description of its parts, 
which is in the explanation of the figures, suffices 
to shew its use. 

I return'd to the patient the next day; and found 
her in a fever, with many colicky pains: but at 
the end of the third day there was nothing extra- 
ordinary. 

I intended to make another search, but I feared 
renewing those accidents: wherefore I contended my- 
self with injecting a liquid digestive; and deferr'd 
any farther trials till after the suppuration was well 
formed, which I expected about the 8th or 9th day. 

I re-visited the patient on the 7th, and found her 
a little feverish, but she had a good night's rest. 
There was a small discharge thro' the canula of tole- 
rably white pus, but of an intolerable smell. The 
canula seem'd to us to be much clogg'd with sloughs; 
and the stench made us suspect a collection and 
lodgment of these sloughs behind the canula. We 
resolved to put in the canula above described; and 
as there was a necessity of dilating, in order to intro- 
duce it; we agreed to take the advantage of this di- 
latation, to try to discover by the crooked forceps, 
which I had brought with me, if there might not 
be a stone to be extracted, or at least some more of 
these excrescences, and to break or bruise such as 
we should not be able to draw, that they may fall 
off by suppuration. 

I executed this trial on the 8th day. The dilata- 
tion was made between two grooved sounds, as it is 
done in the greater apparatus between the male and 
female conductors. I found no stone as yet, but 
brought away clusters of the tops of fungus's a spe- 
|P_297
cimen of which appears in Plate I. Letter F, I crushed 
the rest of the excrescences, and placed the large 
canula. 

Experience has shewn me, that this bruising of 
the fungus's of the bladder is more painful and dan- 
gerous than possibly is imagined. They are far from 
being of the same nature with the polypus of the 
nose, which is pull'd out with little or no pain, and 
without any bad consequence. The fungus's of the 
bladder have more consistence, more solidity, and 
for that reason more sensibility. Accordingly, after 
this last operation, the patient was seized with a vio- 
lent fever, which carried her off in two days. I 
open'd her body, and found the bladder in the con- 
dition represented by the figures, and their expla- 
nation. 

This observation made me think, that if I met 
with a parallel case, that is, a patient with fungous 
excrescences in the bladder, distinctly characterized, 
and accompanied with pains and excessive hæmor- 
rhages, which render the palliative cure useless and 
unsuccessful; and if he had a constitution and cou- 
rage proper to make me hope for success from a great 
operation; I would find a way to attack the excres- 
cences with a cutting instrument, the operations of 
which are much surer and less painful than any 
other method. Practitioners advise to suppurate such 
of these excrescences, as the fingers cannot reach, 
that is, those which can neither be tied not cut. 
But how can one bring such sensible parts to sup- 
puration? we have no ointment that can raise a sup- 
puration in a sound part. Fungus's are a sort of ve- 
getation, which, tho' preternatural, are still living, 
|P_298
and, in some measure, sound parts: how then are 
they to be disposed to suppurate? it must be either 
by pulling them out, or by crushing them, as we 
have done. But seeing this operation is dangerous, 
an instrument should be contrived, which might be 
conveyed to the bottom of the bladder, like the for- 
ceps; and which might at the same time be able to 
cut these inaccessible excrescences, or the greatest 
part of them at least; the remains of which being 
cut open, would thereby acquire the necessary dis- 
positions to suppurate, which are indicated for the 
cure. For this purpose it was, that about that time 
I contrived the cutting forceps of Plate III. the use 
of which will be sufficiently declared in the expla- 
nation of the figures. I did not intend to make this 
instrument public, until I had used it on a living 
body: but, as no opportunity has offer'd since the 
year 1735, I thought I ought not to delay its publi- 
cation any longer; to the end that, if some other 
person met with this opportunity before me, he might 
profit by the reflections, which the preceding obser- 
vation occasioned me to make. 

[}Explanation of the Figures. }]
Plate I. The bladder of the widow Néel, full of 
excrescences. 

AAA, The bladder. 
BB, Its neck. 
C, The incision of my lateral operation. 
DD, Thickness of the coats of the bladder. 
E, Remains of the excrescences, which were not ex- 
tirpated, and seem round or regular, because their 
|P_299
tops ending in clusters were taken off by the 
forceps. 
F, The shape of these tops of the excrescences.

[}Plate II. }]
The same bladder, after removing the excrescences, 
in order to shew their common root E. 

F, Very considerable fleshy fibres, which surround 
this basis, and were confounded in the scirrhous 
substance. It was this scirrhous basis, that I had 
touch'd with the staff, and which I took for a 
hard body. The difficulty of touching it arose 
from the necessity of passing between two ex- 
crescences. 
DD, The great thickness of this bladder. 
[^An illustration of the same bladder without the excrescences on a separate fold-out page. ^]
[}Plate III. }]
Cutting forceps or scissars, to cut the excrescences 
of the bladder or uterus, which are inaccessible to 
the fingers. 

A, The bend of this instrument on the flat of its 
blades. 
B, Buttons, which terminate each blade, and are at 
some little distance from one another, even when 
the blades are closed together: that these ends 
might neither prick nor pinch the coats of the 
bladder. 
[^An illustration of three pairs of scissors, slightly different in size but all having curved blades with buttoned tips, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
[}Plate IV. }]
[}Fig. 1. The new canula. }]
A, The neck, which is to be embraced by the neck 
of the bladder. 
B, The swelling, which is to be within the neck of 
the bladder. 
|P_300
C, The head, which is to be in the cavity of this 
organ, together with its wide openings. 
D, The style or sound of this canula. 
[^An illustration of a curved cannula with a flame-shaped tip, and a similarly curved sound that is to be fitted through it, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
[}Fig. 2. }]
The same canula impoved, inasmuch as its end B, 
which I name introductor, is screw'd on the canula 
A at C, and is unscrew'd by means of the structure of 
this introductor. 
[^An illustration of a straight cannula with a flame-shaped tip screwed on, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
[}Fig. 3. 
The introductor separated from the canula. }]
A, A wire or rod of steel, which supports the end of 
the introductor, and serves to unscrew it from the 
canula. 
B, The extremity of the introductor, which ought 
to be made of silver. 
CC, Elastic steel plates or blades. These plates have 
on the inside of their edge a female screw, which 
enters on a male screw of the outside of the end 
of the canula. Their springiness makes them 
separate when the introductor is mounted on the 
canula; and by this widening asunder they leave 
the openings or eyes of d, d, Fig. 1, 2. But when 
they are unscrew'd, they clofe together, as appears 
in Fig. 3, whereby this end becomes slender enough 
to pass thro' the canula, thro' which this part of 
the instrument is drawn out, when the canula is 
placed in situation; which is the intent of this 
structure; for, by this means the outlet becomes 
larger, and the excrescences cannot be fretted. 
[^An illustration of the flame-shaped tip, showing a long straight rod protruding from its base, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
[}Fig. 4. 
The canula stripp'd of the part above described. }]
A, Its funnel or tube and wide straight orifice: wherein 
|P_301
consists the improvement of this last canula, which 
I had principally in view in the rectification of the 
first.
