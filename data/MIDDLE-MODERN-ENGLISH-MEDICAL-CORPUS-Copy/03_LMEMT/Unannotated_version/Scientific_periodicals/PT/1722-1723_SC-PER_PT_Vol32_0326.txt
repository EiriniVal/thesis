[}III. Observations upon dissecting the Body of a Per- 
son troubled with the Stone. By Dr. Perrot 
Williams, Physician at Haverford-West in 
South-Wales. }]
MR. William Bowen of the Town and County of 
Haverford-West, aged between 40 and 50, hav- 
ing been, for about the Space of seven Years, severely 
afflicted with the usual Symptoms of the Stone in the 
Kidneys and Bladder, viz. Bloody Urine after Exer- 
cise, Strangury, &c. Dy'd in May 1722. His Body 
being opened, there were found in the Bladder six 
smooth oval Stones, exactly of the same Figure, and 
nearly of the same Magnitude: There were also three 
Cells in each Kidney, the Figure of each suitable to 
that of the Stones: The Ureters were so preternatu- 
rally extended, as very easily to admit the largest of 
the Stones to pass from the Kidney to the Bladder. 
The Viscera, &c. appear'd in their natural State.
