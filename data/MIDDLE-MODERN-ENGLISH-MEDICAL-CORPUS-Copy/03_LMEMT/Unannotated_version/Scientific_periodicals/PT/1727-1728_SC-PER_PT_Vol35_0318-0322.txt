[}IX. Two Chirurgical Questions, stated and an- 
swered by John Douglas, Surgeon, F. R. S. }]
Q I. WHether it is not possible in some Mea- 
sure to relieve those Persons (who 
by reason of their great Age, bad Habit of Body, 
&c. cannot submit to any of the great Opera- 
tions for the Stone with tolerable hopes of 
Success) by making an Artificial Fistula in the 
Perinæum? 

A. That a great many Patients offer, both young 
and old, who are afflicted with the Stone in the 
Bladder, whom we cannot with any tolerable hopes 
of Success, advise to submit to the great Ope- 
rations for the Stone, daily Experience shews. It is 
inhuman to cut them, and shews a very great Imper- 
fection in our Art, to say we can give them no Re- 
lief. Is there no Medium yet found out between li- 
ving in extream Misery and submitting to a desperate 
Operation? Yes; Thomas Fienús about 125 Years 
ago, proposed a Palliative Cure for such Patients, 
where a radicative Cure could not be expected; an 
Operation which may be performed with safety on 
the most Ancient; the Wound is so small, and the 
Parts cut of so little consequence to Life. An Opera- 
tion by which we can prevent or alleviate the most 
lamentable Effects of the Stone, viz. The total sup- 
ression of Urine and the cutting Pains they endure in, 
and after making Water, &c. yet this Operation has 
been as little minded all this while by the Hospital-
|P_319
Lithotomists, as Rosset's most excellent Treatise before I 
introduced the Hypogastrick Section in 1719. Tho' 
I admire Fienús's design in making this Fistula, yet 
I can by no means approve of his way of doing it. 

It ought to be performed thus: Place the Patient 
as in Marianus's Operation; pass a Staff into the 
Bladder, then cut the Skin and Fat until you lay that 
Part of the Urethra bare, which reaches from the 
prostate Gland to the Cavernous Urethra; then make 
a small Incision into it with the point of your Knife; 
then withdraw the Staff, and pass a small flexible Ca- 
nula into the Wound of the Urethra; then dress the 
Wound S. A. extract the Canula, clean it and intro- 
duce it again every Dressing, that so you may leave 
a Fistula in the room of the Wound. 

Through this Fistula the Patient himself or any 
one about him, may easily pass an Oiled Probe, 
and push the Stone back whenever he finds him- 
self attack'd with a suppression of Urine, or when 
the Stone presses hard against the Sphincter, when 
endeavouring to make Water, which otherwise could 
not be done without the Ceremony of sending for, 
and staying in misery till a Surgeon comes to pass 
the Catheter, which in such cases is not always to 
be done, without a great deal of Pain, and some- 
times Danger. By this Fistula we can also very 
easily inject any Liquor that may be thought pro- 
per either to prevent or allay the Inflammation of 
the Bladder, or cleanse it from the Gravel, or any 
other sort of filth that may collect there, by which 
the increase of the Stone will be prevented, &c.

In Females all those advantages are obtain'd by the na- 
tural straitness and shortness of the Urethra, whence 
they never suffer the tenth part that Males do; which is 
an incontestable evidence that when the Passage into 
|P_320
the Bladders of Males is made as streight and near as 
short (as is done by the forementioned Fistula) they 
will reap the same advantages by it. 

Therefore Artificial Fistula's in the Perinæum ought 
to be made for those who by reason of their great 
Age, and bad Habit of Body, &c. cannot undergo 
any of the great Operations for the Stone, with any 
hopes of Success. 

Q 2. Whether it is not possible to dilate the artifi- 
ficialFistula in the Perinæum of Males, and the 
Urethra of Females with Spunge or Gentian- 
Tents gradually increased for some time to such a 
width, that we may easily pass a pair of Forceps
into the Bladder, with which the Stone when 
small may be extracted, and when large, or of an 
irregular Figure, broke, and the pieces extracted 
gradually and at different times, when they can- 
not be extracted at once, without fatiguing the 
Patient too much? 

A. To prove that both these Fistula's may be dila- 
ted to a sufficient bigness by the means proposed, (es- 
pecially, if the parts are frequently bathed in a Semi- 
cupium or otherwise, as the Operator shall think pro- 
per, and some warm Oyl injected into the Fistula e- 
very time the Tent is changed, (the better to supple 
and relax the parts,) I shall only make use of three 
Arguments, viz. One from common Experience in 
Analogous Cases; Another from the Operations of 
Nature on the same Parts; And the third from In- 
stances of this Operation being perform'd after the 
Method I propose. 1st, Common Experience shews 
to what a great width Fistula's in all other parts of 
the Body, tho' very small at first, may be dilated 
by Spunge or Gentian-Tents. 2dly, Nature herself 
|P_321
without any Art has frequently perform'd this Ope- 
ration on both Sexes; in Males who have been cut for 
the Stone after the old way, and had Fistula's remain- 
ed in Perinæo. It is often found that some conside- 
rable time afterwards, Stones of no small size have 
appeared which had made their way thro' the Sphincter 
of the Bladder into the Membranous Urethra, and stuck 
near the Orifice of the Fistula, whence they were ea- 
sily and safely extracted. I saw a Stone lately as big 
as a Pullet's Egg that was expelled from the Bladder 
of a young Woman without any help, as her Physi- 
cian assured me, and she had no inconveniency after- 
wards, which certainly would have happen'd if it had 
been extracted after the common violent Method. 
In the last Philosophical Transaction, Dr. Beard of 
Worcester gives an Account of a yet larger Stone, 
that passed after the same manner, but she had the 
common inconveniency afterwards, viz. an Inconti- 
nency of Urine, which was owing more to the rough- 
ness than the bigness of the Stone, which had lace- 
rated the Parts as in the common Operation, which 
might have been prevented had she been assisted in 
time as above. 

3dly. Mons. Collet in his Traité de la Taille, gives an 
Account of a Gentleman on whom he perform'd this 
Operation three different times, and extracted in all 
ten Stones. His Words are as follow: 

Enfin. Mons. Usson etant hors de danger & sa playe 
prête a se cicatriser, prévoyant bien ce qui pourroit arriver 
dans la Suite, je lui conseillai de tenir sa playe ouverte, 
pour y entretenir seulement une petite Canule, qui dans 
l'occasion donneroit une entiere liberté de faire Injection 
pour nettoyer la Vessie de toutes les Immondices & pour 
qu'on pût enlever les nouvelles Pierres qui pourroient se 
former. Il prit ce parti, & il se trouva bien durant 
|P_322
cinque Années, quil a Vecu depuis avec assez de Santé 
Mais a trois differents reprises, je me suis vû Obligè de 
lui tirer jusqu'a dix autres pierres qui s'etoient formées 
dans laVessie: une petite Tente d'eponge preparée mise pen- 
dant quelques heures dans la Fistule à la place de la Canule 
me facilitoit l'Entrée d'une tres petite tennette. Mons. 
Usson s'habilloit dans ce Moment & il sortoit pour aller 
par tout ou ses Affaires l'appelloient. 

I know a Gentleman that now keeps a Fistula in Pe- 
rinæo open for the very same reasons. 

Since then it is evident that Fistula's in all parts of 
the Body are dilatable to a great width, since Nature 
is often able of her self to dilate the very parts in dis- 
pute, to a very extraordinary Degree; and since 
this very Operation I here propose has been suc- 
cessfully performed three times on the same Person, 

Therefore Artificial Fistula's in Males and the Ure- 
thra of Females may be dilated so as to extract any 
Stone without cutting the Body of the Bladder, or 
lacerating any of the Parts. 

N.B. This Operation will appear much less surpri- 
zing, if we consider, that it is only dilating the Sphin- 
cter of the Bladder, &c. in a different manner from 
that daily done in Marianus's Operation, i. e. By this 
Method the Parts are dilated gently and gradually, af- 
ter being well bath'd and anointed, the better to relax 
them. Whereas in Marianus's Operation they are di- 
lated quickly and violently, and then the Stone, be it 
of what Largeness or Figure soever, is forcibly drawn 
out immediately; whence Contusions, Lacerations, 
Hæmorrhages, Inflammations, Mortifications, &c.
