[}Some Uses of the pectoral Syrup. }]
A Drop or two, with a little Honey, given to new- 
born Infants, greatly helps the necessary cleansing 
of the Bowels. Three of Four Drops are a safe Puke 
for them, and cleanse the Stomach and Bowels from 
that Phlegm that causes their Gripes. 

It is of great Service in most Asthma's, and has 
relieved, when the best Remedies have failed. If 
the Fit is violent, give a large Spoonful of it, which 
will soon procure a Vomit or two. If the Fit is mo- 
derate, Two Tea Spoonfuls three Times a Day will 
be sufficient. 

In Fevers that are attended with a laborious Breath- 
ing, it has been found serviceable. 

It is excellent in the Small-pox, as well to vomit 
in the Beginning, as to help on the necessary Saliva- 
tion in the confluent Sort. 

It helps Coughs, and promotes Expectoration. 

From these few Hints, a Physician will be able to 
adjust its Use in other Distempers. I should not

recomment it, had not repeated Experience con- 
vinced me of its Usefulness: And that it may be of 
Use to Posterity, I mean to Physicians that are really 
such, I give the Receipt of it to be given to the 
President and Censors of the College of Physicians, 
London.
