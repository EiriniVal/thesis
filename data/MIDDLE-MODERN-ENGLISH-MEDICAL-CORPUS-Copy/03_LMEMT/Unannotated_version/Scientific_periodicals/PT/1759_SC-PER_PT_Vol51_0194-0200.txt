[}XXII. A remarkable Case of an Empyema. 
By Mr. Joseph Warner, F. R. S. and Sur- 
geon to Guy's Hospital. }]
[/1./]MORRIS EVANS, aged 30 years, 
on the 13th of March, 1759, was 
admitted into Guy's hospital, with a remarkable com- 
plaint in his chest, which attacked him in the month 
of August 1758, with the symptoms of a pleurisy. 
|P_195
Upon inspection it appeared, that the left side of the 
thorax was greatly inlarged, and prodigiously dis- 
tended: the pectoral muscle was somewhat raised up; 
on pressure it felt soft, and readily gave way: upon a 
removal of the pressure, the integuments resumed 
their former appearance, no marks of impression re- 
maining on this, or any other part of the thorax, so 
as to constitute the characteristic of an œdematous 
swelling. 

The spaces betwixt the 9th and 10th, and betwixt 
the 10th and 11th ribs, counting from above, were 
visibly inlarged, and somewhat elevated: they felt 
soft, and yielded to the fingers; but were not at all 
inflamed, or otherwise discoloured. Upon examina- 
tion, I discovered a fluctuation in both these parts. 
The general symptoms that attended this case were 
similar to those arising from all considerable collec- 
tions of fluids deposited in either cavities of the 
thorax: for instance, the patient had a continual 
slow fever; a short cough, but without the least ex- 
pectoration of matter; a great difficulty in respiration, 
particularly in the acts of expiration. He was inca- 
pable of lying down on the right side, without very 
great uneasiness; he was much emaciated; and his 
countenance was uniformly sallow: he did not com- 
plain of so much pain, or so great a difficulty in 
breathing, when in an erect posture, as I have some- 
times observed in diseases of this kind even where 
the quantity of extravasated fluid has been much 
less; but at the same time I must acknowledge, that 
no fair inference could be deduced from hence, be- 
cause of the peculiar position the diseased side was 
put in when the poor man sat down, or stood up; 
|P_196
either of which he was incapable of doing without 
being supported. The left side of the thorax inclined 
forwards, and protuberated in a peculiar manner, so 
as to give the head and trunk an horizontal posture; 
in which position of the body, the weight of the con- 
tained fluid most certainly was, in part, prevented 
from pressing so forcibly upon the left portion of the 
diaphragm, the mediastinum, and the right portion 
of the lungs, as it must necessarily have done in a 
more erect position of the body. He had one sym- 
ptom, which I had never before observed in patients 
labouring under this complaint; that is, he was in- 
capable of lying on his back, without bringing on 
very alarming threats of suffocation; but he did not 
remember ever to have heard any noise or rattling of 
the pus upon motion. He could lie most conveni- 
ently on his left side; but even that posture was of 
late become very painful to him. In short, he could 
find no tolerable posture to put his body into, but 
that of inclining it considerably forwards, which (I 
have already observed) he was under a necessity of 
doing, to enable him to draw his breath; and I dare 
venture to say, that, upon attending to the subse- 
quent part of the history of this poor mortal's case, 
the reason, why such effects should be produced from 
such a cause, will very readily occur to those, who 
have a moderate degree of knowledge of the formation 
and uses of these parts of the human body. Upon 
making an incision upon the most prominent part of 
the space betwixt the 10th and 11th rib, in the cavity 
of the thorax of the left side, at least eight Winches- 
ter quarts of a thin yellow matter, not at all fœtid, 
was discharged upon the spot in a full stream: the 
|P_197
matter issued thro' the wound by leaps, and was 
projected at the distance of two yards and upwards 
from the patient's body: he did not faint during the 
operation, nor afterwards; but from that moment he 
grew easy; his symptoms abated; he slept well at 
night; and the next day he had no bad symptoms, 
except that his difficulty in breathing was not quite 
removed. This, indeed, could not reasonably be ex- 
pected, considering the long disuse and extension 
which the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles, and 
the rest of the muscles of respiration, had undergone 
from the pressure and weight of the confined matter, 
joined to the injury which the lungs themselves had 
sustained. He continued with very little alteration 
till the fourth day, when his respiration became worse, 
accompanied with bad nights, a quick pulse, a great 
discharge of fœtid matter from the wound, and a 
flushing in his face. These symptoms remained till 
the 9th. To-day his breathing was better, his pulse 
became more calm, the flushings in his face disap- 
peared; but the discharge was considerable in quan- 
tity, and he complained of a want of appetite, which, 
till now, had been tolerably good ever since the ope- 
ration. On the tenth day, his difficulty of breathing 
returned; the discharge was very great, and offen- 
sive; he had very little sleep last night: in short, he 
seems greatly upon the decline. 11th, 12th, and 
13th, he continued much as on the 10th. 14th and 
15th days he has had more sleep than usual; his ap- 
petite very bad; cough frequent, and troublesome; 
discharge very thin, and considerable in quantity. 
Upon exerting his powers in the act of expiration, to 
discharge the matter from the cavity, there appeared 
|P_198
an eminence betwixt the 7th and 8th ribs (counting 
from above) on the anterior lateral part of the tho- 
rax, which was very tender; but, upon his ceasing 
to exert himself, the swelling disappeared. 16th and 
17th days, his cough very troublesome; the discharge 
from the wound was great; the matter very thin, 
and fœtid; he gets very little sleep; his pulse quick, 
and low; his tongue dry, and parched: in short, to 
all appearance, he seemed to have a very short time 
to live. But, notwithstanding these threatening sym- 
ptoms, he very unexpectedly survived till the 10th of 
June following (exactly 12 weeks from the time of 
his undergoing the first operation). In the middle of 
the month of April next preceding his death, he 
thought himself much better than he had been for 
many days before: his discharge at this time was 
much lessened; but his pulse was very weak, and 
fluttering. 

About three weeks before the patient's death, a 
second opening was made by incision betwixt the 
11th and 12th ribs by my collegue Mr. Way, under 
whose immediate care this poor man was from the 
day of his admission into the hospital, and who treated 
him with the greatest humanity and judgment. 
Three days before the patient's decease, the swelling 
betwixt the 7th and 8th ribs burst of itself, and dis- 
charged at least a pint of matter, that was exceed- 
ingly offensive. 

Upon opening the body, the following particulars 
were discovered: the right portion of the lungs was 
greatly ulcerated on its superior part, where it ad- 
hered firmly to the pleura: on the inferior part of 
the cavity, the lungs adhered to the diaphragm; the 
|P_199
lobes of the lungs on this side were not so much 
wasted as I expected they would have been, from the 
great degree of pressure which they had so long su- 
stained from the prodigious quantity of matter, that 
was confined in the opposite cavity of the thorax; 
nor was there any extravasation in the right cavity of 
the thorax. 

The lobes of the lungs on the left side were almost 
intirely destroyed: in this cavity there was near a 
quart of fœtid matter; the whole of its internal sur- 
face was ulcerated, and the two inferior ribs were 
carious in the neighbourhood of the second opening. 
In every other part the ribs were sound; so was the 
sternum. 

The pericardium and heart appeared in their natu- 
ral state. The injury done to the internal surface of 
the left cavity of the thorax was so great, as to have 
destroyed almost the whole of the intercostal muscles 
on that side of the trunk. 

N. B. It may be worth remarking, that this pa- 
tient did not any time suffer the least inconvenience 
from the pressure of the external air, which entered 
into the cavity of the thorax thro' the incisions, as 
has been said by authors to have happened in a great 
degree in the like cases; but as that effect was not 
produced in this, or any other instances of the like 
kind, which has come under my inspection, I am 
inclined to conjecture, that the bad effects of the 
pressure of the external air, when admitted thro' an 
opening made into the cavity of the thorax, is such 
an inconvenience as may rather be supposed to be 
likely to happen, than has been really known to hap- 
pen often; the act of breathing having never been 
|P_200
in the least suspended, altho' the openings made into 
the cavity have been very large, and the time taken 
for dressing the patient (sometimes once, sometimes 
twice a day) has been very considerable; but, on the 
contrary, at every dressing, I have observed, that the 
patient has breathed with greater freedom and ease 
than he could do before the performance of this ope- 
ration, or even for some hours before the dressings 
were renewed. As the matter in this disease lies 
loosely in the cavity of the thorax, there is no greater 
danger of wounding the lungs in this operation, than 
there is of wounding the intestines or omentum, in 
tapping the abdomen in the ascites; and if the me- 
thod be pursued, which I have recommended for 
making the incision thro' the intercostal muscles, 
there will be no danger of wounding the intercostal 
artery, which is a circumstance much dreaded by 
some practitioners, but with no great reason. How- 
ever, was this to happen, it would probably not be 
attended with any bad consequences, as the bleeding 
might very readily be stopped by pressure, or other- 
wise.
