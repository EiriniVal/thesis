[}I. A Letter from Mr. David Martineau Surgeon 
in Norwich, to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. Coll. 
Med. Lond. Pr. S. R. V. Pr. Concerning 
Stones voided per Anum. }]
Norwich, Oct. 5th 1723. 

THESE Stones (Vid. Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) were 
voided by a poor Woman, per Anum, on the 
26, 27, and 28th of March last past, who was then 
pregnant about the 11, or 12th Week, according to 
Computation. I was call'd in the Night to this poor 
Woman on the 23d, who in Appearance was in the 
Extremity of a Convulsion Fit, attended with violent 
Vomitings, which when over, she complain'd of great 
Pain in her Back, from her Reins downward to the A- 
nus, upon which I blooded her, order'd some Anti-Eme- 
ticks, and left her: She continued with much Pain the 
whole Day; on the 24th, in the Night, her Fits re- 
turn'd again with double Force, her Pains also increa- 
sing like unto Labour-Pains, put me upon further In- 
quiry, but nothing appear'd more than ordinary; the Ex- 
tremity of Pain drove me to the Use of Glysters, which 
was attempted, but none could be thrown up, although 
repeated by one and another of the most experienced 
Nurses, upon which I gave her a gentle Draught, which 
she observed increas'd her Pain with a strong Tenesmus, 
that continued near three Hours before the largest Stone 
appear'd, which stopp'd at the upper Part A, D, Fig. 1. 
but was quickly remov'd by pressing the lower Protube- 
rance C, upon which, with a plentiful Discharge, she had 
|P_434
Ease, slept some Hours, waking with a Desire to stool, 
and voided with it the 2d and 3d; and the next Day, at 
four Hours Distance, the other two. She recovered per- 
fectly, and was deliver'd of a very fine living Girl, on the 
24th of August past. Upon Inquiry, it seems, she had been 
frequently troubled, for fourteen Years past, with Pains 
in her Side and Stomach without Vomitings; which 
is all she remembers. 

The Largeness of the Stones, their Seat and Substance, 
is what to me seems worthy Speculation; their being all 
alike in Colour and Weight, according to their Dimen- 
sions, is the Reason I broke but one.
