[}XXXVIII. Some Anatomical Observations. By 
Mr. William Cheselden, Surgeon, F. R. S.}]
FIG. 8. Tab. VI. shews the beginning of the Aorta, [/1./]
or great Artery, from the Heart of a Woman who 
died of a Dropsy. A. is the Aorta. B. B. two Chalk- 
stones which possessed the Place of the Semilunar Valves. 
The left Ventricle of the Heart was dilated to twice its 
Natural Magnitude. We supposed that these Stones 
occasioned the Dropsy, by obstructing the Valves, and 
hindring a regular Distribution of the Blood.

Fig. 9. shews a Bone taken from the Falx, or first 
Process of the Dura Mater, of a Man who died of violent 
Head-aches. 
[^An illustration of a small, triangular, bone-like object, apparently falx cerebelli, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 10. shews a Bone taken from the between the 
Ventricles of the Heart of a Man, who died Hydropic 
and Tabid. In this Body the whole Pericardium adher'd 
to the Heart.

Fig. 11. shews the Optick Nerves; the right Nerve 
being wasted and discoloured: The Eyes both appeared 
to be very good. I had not an opportunity of inquiring 
into the Case of this Person; but I suppose it must have 
been a Gutta Serena. 

|P_282
I opened another Eye of a Man who died of that Di- 
stemper; in which I found that part of the Nerves, which 
is within the Cranium, crushed flat by the anterior Lobes 
of the Brain, their Ventricles being full of Lymph.

Fig. 12. shews three Spleens taken from one Bo- 
dy. 
[^An illustration showing three spleens with their splenic arteries, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 13. Two Spleens taken from a Man. 
[^An illustration showing two spleens, with their splenic arteries, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 14. Two Spleens taken from a Woman. 
[^An illustration showing two spleens, with their splenic arteries, on a separate fold-out page. ^]
N. B. That in all these three Cases of the Spleens, each 
had proper Vessels, but the Arteries only are there ex- 
press'd; and that the Spleens in each Body taken to- 
gether were but equal in Magnitude to the one we u- 
ually meet with. 

A Heart, with the Vena Azygos inserted into 
the right Auricle; and the Descending Cava com- 
ing round the Basis of the Heart, above the Aorta and 
Pulmonary Vessels, to enter the Auricle at the lower part 
with the Ascending Cava. 

An Ureter double two Thirds of its length next 
the Kidneys, and distended by Stones passing through 
it. 

The Tubæ Fallopianæ impermeable, and without Alæ 
Vespertilionis; the outer Ends being connected to the 
Testes.
