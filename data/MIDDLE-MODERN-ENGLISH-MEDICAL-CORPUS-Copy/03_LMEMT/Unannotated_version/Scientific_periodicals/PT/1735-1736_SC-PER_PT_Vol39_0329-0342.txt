[}VIII. Of an Inguinal Rupture, with a Pin
in the Appendix Cœci, incrusted with 
Stone; and some Observations on 
Wounds in the Guts; by Claudius 
Amyand, Esq; Serjeant Surgeon to His 
Majesty, and F. R. S. }]
OCtober 8, 1735. Hanvil Anderson, a Boy, 11 
Years of Age, was admitted into St. George's Ho- 
spital near Hyde-Park Corner, for the Cure of a 
Hernia Scrotalis, which he had had from his In- 
fancy, and a Fistula between the Scrotum and Thigh 
terminating into it, which for a Month last past had 
discharged a great Quantity of an unkindly sort of 
Matter. The Rupture was small, and not trouble- 
some, and Part of it could be replaced, but as it ap- 
peared that the Sinuous Ulcer sprung from that Part 
that could not; so 'twas evident that the Cure of the 
Fistula depended upon the Cure of the Hernia, which 
latter could be obtained by no other Operation than 
that for the Bubonocele, which was agreed to, and 
performed the 6th Day of December following. 

This Operation proved the most complicated and 
perplexing I ever met with, many unsuspected Oddi- 
ties and Events concurring to make it as intricate as 
it proved laborious and difficult. 

This Tumour, principally composed of the Omen- 
tum, was about the Bigness of a small Pippin: 
In it was found the Appendix Cœci perforated by 
a Pin incrusted with Stone towards the Head, the 
Point of which having perforated that Gut, gave way 
|P_330
to a Discharge of Fæces through the fistulous Open- 
in therein, as the Portion of the Pin obturating the 
Aperture in it shifted its Situation. The Abscess 
formed in the Hernial Bag occasionally, and the Sup- 
puration for two Months last past from this Place out- 
wardly, had knit and confounded, and, as it were, 
inbodied together the Gut and Omentum with the 
Hernial Bag, and these with the Spermatick Vessels 
and the Testicule, so that it was difficult to distin- 
quish them from each other, as it was to separate 
them without wounding them; this Pin, whose 
Point was fixed in the Omentum, continually shifting 
its Situation, and occasioning a Discharge of Fæces. 
The Pin frequently lying in the way of the Knife, 
and starting out of the wounded Gut, as a Shot out 
of a Gun, the Inundation of Fæces upon this Occa- 
sion from a Gut we could not well distinguish, were 
so many Difficulties in the way: But the greatest yet 
was, what to do with the Gut, which all this while 
was unknown, and of which we could not come to 
the Knowledge, till the Operation was over; for this 
Appendix Cœci, which was the only Gut found in the 
Rupture, was so contracted, carnous, duplicated, and 
changed in its Figure and Substance, that it was im- 
possible to determine what kind of Gut it was, or 
to find out that it was only this Appendix elongated, 
and in Disguise. 

We apprehended none of these Difficulties, when 
we undertook this Operation, in which we proceeded 
as usual: The Omentum lying uppermost in the Her- 
nial Bag was dissected from the Parts it was knit to, 
and particularly the Gut it was imbodied with, and 
afterwards cut off close to the Abdominal Muscles 
|P_331
without any previous Ligature, the Vessels in it being 
small, and the Substance of it more like a Sweet- 
bread than the Caul. 

Much Time was spent in this Dissection; we were 
streightened for Room, and greatly disturbed by the 
Discharge of the Fæces coming out of the Gut, upon 
every motion the Pin lodged in it and the Omentum 
suffered, upon the Separation of these from each 
other. The Gut forming a double Tube, like a 
double-jointed Syphon, continuing in the Curve as it 
passed over the Testicule and Spermaticks, was separated 
one part from the other and from the adjacent Parts, as 
far as the Aperture in the Abdominal Muscles, where 
the unperforated End of it was separated therefrom, and 
thence stretched out and unfolded, which brought in 
View the Aperture made in it by the Pin hitherto con- 
cealed, through which that Part of it, which was in- 
crusted with Chalk, had just made its way out upon 
an occasional Pressure, as a Cork out of a Bottle. It 
was the Opinion of the Physicians and Surgeons pre- 
sent, to amputate this Gut: To which End a circular 
Ligature was made about the sound Part of it, two 
Inches above the Aperture, and this being cut off an 
Inch below the Ligature, was replaced in the Abdo- 
men, in such a Manner that an artificial Anus might 
be made there, if the Patient's Case should require it. 
Afterwards so much of the Hernial Bag as had been 
detached from the Skin, the Spermaticks, &c. was 
cut off, which, as they appeared in a sound State, were 
preserved in Situ. The Fistulous Opening adjoining 
to the Thigh, and answering to the Aperture in the 
Gut, was opened; some Angles of Skin in the way 
removed; The Aperture in the Muscles, which had 
|P_332
been inlarged by Incision, was stopped up with a 
Tent; and the rest of the Dressings and the Situation 
of the Patient ordered so, as to remove from the 
Wound all such Pressure from within as might disturb 
the Cure. 

'Tis easy to conceive that this Operation was as 
painful to the Patient as laborious to me: It was a 
continued Dissection, attended with Danger on Parts 
not well distinguished: It lasted near half an Hour, 
and the Patient bore it with great Courage. During 
it the Patient vomited largely, and had several Stools, 
but was soon composed by half an Ounce of Diaco- 
dium, and Emollient Embrocations and Fomentations, 
frequently applied warm on the Belly: He was 
blooded, and an Emollient Carminative oily Clyster 
was ordered to be applied in the Evening; but as he 
was easy, and the Belly not Tense, that was omitted. 
He was confined to a very sparing Diet, and his Body 
kept open by Clysters, injected every 2d Day, when 
Stools were wanted, to prevent straining. When 
dressed upon the 4th Day after the Operation, every 
thing appeared well, and we had good Reason to 
hope for a Cure, especially as the Discharge by the 
Anus was Natural. The Tent put into the Abdominal 
Aperture was not removed till the 8th. Upon the 10th 
the Ligature round the Appendix Cœci, where it had 
been amputated, dropt off, and no Fæces followed it; 
and as it was then plain they had taken the natural 
Course, from that Time the Wound was treated like 
an ordinary one, saving it was observed to keep a 
strong and constant Pressure over the Abdominal Aper- 
ture, as well to fence against the Intrusion of the Vis- 
cera into the Wound, as by a strong Incarnation and 
|P_333
Cicatrix, effectually to secure the Patient against a 
Rupture. During the Time of the Cure he was con- 
fined to his Bed, always kept to sparing Diet, and or- 
dered never to go to Stool but in a Bed-pan; by these 
means the Wound was completely healed up in less 
than a Month, and the Patient soon after discharged 
with a Truss, which he was ordered to wear some 
Time, to confirm the Cure. 

That the Appendix Cœci should be the only Gut 
found in this Rupture, is a Case singular in Practice: 
This was full of Excrements, and occasionally could 
be distended with an additional Quantity, which up- 
on Pressure was returned into the Colon, with that 
kind of Noise which Guts replaced generally give. 
This had occasioned a Diminution of the Tumour 
when compressed, before the Operation was per- 
formed, as the Patient was lying backwards with his 
Head downwards, and an Increase of it as he stood 
erect, when the Fæces from the Colon could get into 
it again. 

The Patient does not remember, when he swal- 
lowed the Pin which had perforated the Gut within 
the Rupture. But as this Rupture was from his In- 
fancy, fixed and unreducible, so it is likely the Pin 
had then made its way into the Appendix Cœci pro- 
lapsed; and that an Inflammation ensuing thereon, 
had occasioned an Adhesion, whereby the Increase of 
the Tumour had been checked, and the Reduction of 
the Parts prolapsed thereby, rendered impracticable. 

The Surgeons who constantly dressed the Patient 
before the Operation, did observe then, as they have 
since, that the Humour discharged formerly at the 
Fistula, had frequently the Appearance, and as they 
|P_334
thought, the Smell of Excrements, so that there is 
no Doubt that the Cause of it was the Wound made 
in the Gut, by the Pin giving way occasionally to such 
a Discharge. The Patient also perfectly remembers, 
that the Impostumation or Gathering preceding the 
fistulous Discharge was attended with very little Pain, 
or much less than generally attends Suppuration. 
Which shews that the Extravasation of the Excre- 
ments from the Gut into the Hernial Bag, and the 
bursting of this Bag, were the Cause of the fistulous 
Discharge, and of the continuance of it outwardly. 

As to the Pin found in the Rupture at the Time 
of the Operation, it is observable, that two Thirds 
of it, incrusted with a chalky Matter, were confined 
and concealed within the Gut; the other Third next 
the Point, had made its way through it, the Point 
of which was so lodged in the Omentum wherein it was 
fixed, as to leave a free Passage for the Excrement 
from the perforated Gut outwardly, whenever the 
Perforation in the Gut, upon shifting the Posi- 
tion of the inclosed Pin, could open, and afford a 
Passage for the Discharge of the Fæces this way, 
which was as oft as this conical or pyramidal Pin 
did alter its Place, or did not exactly obturate the 
Aperture in the Appendix Cœci, it exactly fitted. I 
have already observed, that the Aperture made in the 
Gut by the Pin, lay concealed, the Point being 
lodged in the Omentum, lying parallel with the 
Gut, which was here duplicated, where it was 
so secured, that it seemed almost impossible it 
could ever make its way out of this Place, and its 
other Confinement in the Gut, as the Aperture was 
callous, and so resisting that it was with some Vio- 
|P_335
lence it was forced out of its Confinement through 
an Aperture fitted for the Point only and so 
streight, that the Report upon its coming out was 
like that of a Cork out of a Bottle; for though it 
appeared the Opening had occasionally been inlarged, 
as the incrusted Part of the Pin was pressed forward 
into it, yet it is plain Nature's Attempts to get rid of 
it had been fruitless, and might possibly have been 
so during all the Patient's Life. 

Sir Hans Sloane has furnished the Curious with 
Instances of Bodies incrusted in the Guts with Stone, 
and of some making their way out, when there was 
little Probability of it. Daily Experience shews how 
far Nature will struggle to free herself, so that it it 
always most eligible to trust them to her Care: This 
may appear from the Difficulties that have attended 
the Cure of this Case, which at last did not prove 
so successful as it was first hoped for; for the Pa- 
tient having been remiss in the wearing of his Truss, 
upon some Effort the Guts found a way into the 
Inguen again, six Months after the healing of the 
Wound. This Case also shews, that the best Ope- 
ration, and the utmost Care, is no Security against 
the Relapse of a Rupture. This is the 3d or 4th 
Instance I have met with, of the Insufficiency of this 
Operation to effectuate a Cure of Ruptures; and yet 
it is plain, this is by far more likely to prove effec- 
tual, than the Caustick or any other Method cried 
up for the Cure of this Evil. In a growing 
Age, a good Spring Truss is an effectual Remedy; 
and in an Adult, this should be the ultimate one, 
though it is no more than a Palliative Cure. 

|P_336
N. B. The Omentum and the Gut amputated, with 
the Pin perforating it, are in the Repository of the 
Royal Society. 

This Observation puts me in Mind of two I made 
during the late War in Flanders, and of two more 
lately in London. 

[}Observation I. }]
Upon opening the Body of a Soldier who had la- 
boured many Years with an Inguinal and Scrotal Rup- 
ture, I found in a Segment of the Ilion, an Appendix 
like a Cœcum, about six Inches long; arising from 
that Gut, and nearly of the same Diameter with the 
Gut itself, the Coats whereof were somewhat thinner 
than those of the Ilion this Cœcum did arise from, 
whose Membranes and Dimensions were Natural. 
This Elongation of a Segment of the Ilion appeared 
as if it had been lodged in the Rupture Bag it lay 
near to, and into which it had been stretched along 
the Vagina of the Spermatick Vessels down to the 
Testicule, according to the Expansion of the Rupture 
Bag, which was of the same Dimension: This Pro- 
duction of the Ilion, or Appendix Ilii, was full of 
Fæces, somewhat narrower at its Rife or Opening into 
the Ilion than elsewhere, but nearly resembling it, 
and as sound as that Gut it sprung from. 

[}Observation II. }]
A Soldier having been shot through the Belly, the 
Ball was cut out upon the posterior part of the Os 
|P_337
Iliûm. Through both Wounds the Fæces were 
chiefly discharged for several Months after, and at 
Dressings a great Number of flat Worms, dead or 
alive, were found upon the Plaister. The Fæces 
having by degrees taken their Course through the 
Anus, in five or six Months after, the two Wounds 
being healed up, the Patient returned to his Duty as 
a Soldier, and soon after was made Corporal, and 
then Serjeant. 

Eight Years after this, I had him again under my 
Care at the Hospital, where he was brought with the 
Head of the Os Humeri, together with that of the 
Acromion and Clavicule, in the Articulation with the 
Scapula, fractured by a Cannon-shot, which thereby 
was laid all open. The Limb was immediately cut 
off in the Articulation with the Scapula, having first 
premised a Ligature about the Flesh surrounding the 
Vessels, by thrusting close to the Bone a Pack-Needle 
armed with a strong Packthread, there being no room 
for the Tourniquet[/1./]: He lost very little more Blood 
in the Operation, than if a Tourniquet had been ap- 
plied; but the great Discharge of Matter sunk him, 
and he died the 8th Day after. 

The Death of this Patient gave me an Opportunity 
of examining how the former Wound in the Gut 
had been cured. I had thought the Wound had been 
in the Iliûm, from the Thinness of the Fæces discharged 
through that Wound; but, upon Dissection, I found 
|P_338
it had been in the Colon in the broadest Part of it. This 
was very much contracted, and made narrow in that 
Part of it that had been shot through, where it ap- 
peared pursed up, and inseparably knit to the Iliûm 
Bone. However, the Patient never had complained 
of any Inconveniency therefrom, though the Narrow- 
ness of the Gut in this Place was such, as seemed to 
make the Descent of the Fæces difficult. 

[}Observation III. }]
On the 19th of January 1729, I attended Miss— 
aged 14, on account of a suppurated Tumour on the 
Navel, whose Situation was under the Musculi Recti. 
This Patient had had, what is truely called, a Starting 
at the Navel in her Infancy; and of late had com- 
plained, at Times, of a Swelling there, and also of 
Colicks, Gripes, or Vomitings, that used to go off, 
particularly as that Swelling disappeared. As these 
grew more troublesome, she lately had taken a Vomit, 
from which Time she had been greatly caustive, and 
her Reachings, Vomitings, and Colicks, had proved 
more constant, together with an increasing Tension 
and Pain in the Fore-part of the Belly, and a Tenderness 
at the Navel, as Matter was gathering there. 

Some Days before I was called in, Dr. Campbell
had employed the properest Remedies to remove these 
Complaints. Upon a Consultation, we agreed to 
discharge by Incision the Matter collected at the Na- 
vel, being about a Spoonful of undigested Fluid, that 
had made its way through the Aponeurosis of the Ab- 
dominal Muscles adjoining to the Navel Cicatrix: 
Notwithstanding which, the Tension of the Belly, 
|P_339
the Caustiveness, the Reachings, and Vomitings, rather 
increasing, as in the Miserere Mei, and having thence 
a Reason to apprehend a Strangulation and Suppuration 
of some of the Viscera in the Neighbourhood of the 
Navel, Dr. Hollings being called in, it was agreed 
to inlarge the Aperture made by the fore-mentioned 
Matter in the Linea Alba, with a View and Intent to 
know the State the Parts were in, to reduce what we 
found there, or at least to procure a more free Dis- 
charge to the Matter collected under the Aponeurosis
of the Muscles: For a Fortnight and more, every 
Thing was done that could internally or externally 
ease the Discharge, and open the Passage for the Fæces 
downwards, but all in vain. The Patient was a whole 
Fortnight without a Stool, all the Symptoms daily 
increasing, though towards the latter End she vomited 
rather more seldom: Yet, as she was still taking in, so 
the Dimensions of her Belly increased in Proportion, 
and the more for that the Air confined and rarefied in 
the Fæces pent in, added daily to the Tension; which 
at last had-stretched the Skin to the utmost. There 
was also a Suppression of Urine, the Fundus of the 
Bladder being stretched towards the Navel, at the same 
Time that the Neck of it was compressed by the Fæces 
bearing down in the Pelvis, and a Tumour sprung up 
about the Anus, as if they had been seeking a Passage 
that way. It was proposed to scoop them out, but 
the Rectum was found empty, and the Obstruction as 
far beyond the Reach of any Chirurgical Operation, 
as it had proved against all the Means hitherto em- 
ployed. 

The Patient was now reduced to the lowest Ebb. 
The Dejections were Excrementitious, her Pulse de- 
|P_340
pressed, and extremely weak; she had Rigors, clammy 
Sweats, and all the Symptoms that denote an approach- 
ing Death, from a Mortification in the Guts, when of 
a sudden the Fæces bursted the Gut, and forcing their 
way through the Incision at the Navel, a Quantity equal 
to two or three Quarts, intermixed with various kinds 
of Fruits and Seeds, which she had been taking during 
her Illness, flowed out like a Torrent, with a surprizing 
roaring Noise, which gave her immediate Relief. The 
Discharge continued very great all that Day, but the 
Aperture in the Hernial Bag was not answerable to that 
in the Gut, so that the Discharge there was at Times 
checked by Substances obturating it; this Aperture 
therefore was inlarged by Incision, and thereby the 
Patient released from the Violence of the Vomiting 
and Hickup. From this Time we began to entertain 
some hopes of a Cure; for though the Patient was ex- 
tremely reduced, and the Discharge continued exceed- 
ingly great during several Days, with a Singultus and 
Vomitings, yet she was refreshed with Sleep, and was 
able to retain some Nourishment. The Tension of the 
Belly subsisted, though in a lesser degree, until the 
Fæces had made their way downwards, and so did the 
Vomitings at Times, so long as the Inflammation con- 
tinued. The Diet was such as the Case required; 
Clysters were frequently applied, as well as Fomenta- 
tions, and every Thing else that could determine or 
invite the Discharge through the Anus, and restore the 
distended Guts to their Tone; but from the Time the 
Fæces bursted the Gut, it was 12 Days before any took 
the natural Course; and then we were again brought 
to the Brink of Ruin, for they then poured down so 
fast for a Day or two, that the Patient was like to have 
|P_341
sunk under them: However, this severe Evacuation 
was timely conquered by Absorbents and Diluents: It 
took off the remaining Tension of the Belly, and all 
Vomitings; and as from this Time the Fæces had a free 
Discharge the natural way, and the Discharge through 
the Wound decreased in proportion, so the Wound 
in the Gut, and the external Wound in the Integuments 
were healed up in about three Weeks, in such Man- 
ner that the Patient has ever since enjoyed a most per- 
fect Health. 

[}Observation IV. }]
It happened that I was not a meer Stranger to the 
principal Circumstances of this Case, as in the Year 
1716 I had attended such another with the late Mr. 
Lafage, Surgeon, viz. Miss—a Girl about four 
Years of Age, in whom the same Cause had produced 
the like Effects; for upon a Suppuration of the Omen- 
tum strangulated in the Navel of this Patient, the 
Fæces detained in the neighbouring Gut had in like 
Manner forced their way through the Navel: The 
Accident previous to the bursting, and subsequent up- 
on it, having been nearly the same as in the former 
Observation; only the Cure proved somewhat more 
tedious, for the Wound was kept open by Currants- 
seeds frequently working their way out at the Navel 
for about 12 Months after; when it was made com- 
plete: so that the Hardships the Patient has undergone 
since in Child-bearing, and several hazardous Labours, 
have not been able to disturb it. 

Hence it appears, that the Parts inflamed and in Con- 
tact have been coalesced and knit together, so as to 
|P_342
prevent any Extravasation from the wounded or bursted 
Gut into the Cavity of the Abdomen. 

That the Cure in the two last Cases has been owing 
to a free Discharge of the Fæces through the Wound, 
and consequently that when in a Gut-Rupture the Part 
prolapsed cannot be reduced, a Cure may be hoped 
for by making such an Opening in the Guts, before 
they are intirely sphacelated, as may procure a free Dis- 
charge to the Fæces pent in, and thereby secure the Pa- 
tient's Life. 

That if this happens to the Colon or Cæcum, the 
Tube of it will so far be preserved as to open a free 
Discharge for the Fæces the natural way; and if that 
cannot be obtained in a Wound of the small Gut, yet 
the Discharge may be secured by making the Wound 
an artificial Anus. 

That the readiest way to obtain a Cure of a wound- 
ed or bursted Gut, is to keep it in Contact with the 
outward Wound, and the Patient in a very low Diet. 

That the Deligation of the Vessels of the Omentum 
previous to the Amputation of it, being liable to many 
Exceptions, it is more eligible to forbear it, saving 
when the Vessels are large; for when reduced loose 
and floating, it is less liable to the Inflammations and 
Suppurations that attend the Separation of the Ligature.
