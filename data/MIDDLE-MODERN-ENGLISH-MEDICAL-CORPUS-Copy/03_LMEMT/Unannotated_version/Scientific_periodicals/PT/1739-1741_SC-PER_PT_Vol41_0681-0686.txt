[}V. A Letter from M. le Cat, M. D. F. R. S.
Surgeon to the Hotel Dieu at Rouen, and 
Royal Demonstrator in Anatomy and Sur- 
gery, to C. Mortimer, M. D. Secr. R. S.
concerning the Foramen ovale being found 
open in the Hearts of Adults, and of the 
Figure of the Canal of the Urethra. Trans- 
lated from the French by T. S. M. D. 
F. R. S.}]
SIR, 

I Have seen in the Philosophical Transactions of 
the Royal Society, No 439. that you are 
not displeased with Observations on the Foramen 
ovale in Adults. The Anatomical Amphitheatre, 
which I have established at Rouen furnishes me with 
frequent Opportunities of observing. Last Winter, 
I applied particularly to the Circulation of the Blood 
in the Fœtus.—The Advantages that may be drawn 
from the Parallel, put me upon making the like 
Experiments on Adults. I have a number of times 
measured the Cavities of the Heart, and Vessels that 
depart from it, in both these Subjects; and I therein 
examined the State of the Foramen ovale, Canalis 
arteriosus, &c. I now send you my Remarks on the 
Foramen ovale open in the Adult, and some few 
others on the Figure of the Urethra. 

I have the Honour to be, SIR, 

Your most humble 
and most obedient Servant, 
Claud. Nic. Le Cat.

[}1. Of the Foramen ovale open in the Adult, and of its 
different Sorts. }]
THIS last Winter I opened a great Number of 
dead Bodies of Men grown, and did not find 
the Foramen ovale open in any of them. 

The oldest of the Male Subjects, in which I found 
it open, was a Lad of 15 Years of Age. 

Of 20 Bodies of Women, which I examined, in 
Seven I found the Foramen ovale open. 

Among the Number of Openings that remain of 
this Foramen, there is a great Variety in their Shape, 
and in that of the Cicatrices or Adherences of the 
Valve: However, they may conveniently be reduced 
to Three Sorts, expressed in the Figures hereto an- 
nexed, see Tab. II.

The First and Second Figure represent the First 
Sort of Foramen ovale, that remains open in the 
Adult. 

The Third and Fourth Figures represent the Second 
Sort; and Fig. 5 and 6. the Third. 

[}Explanation of the Figures. }]
Fig. I.  The Foramen ovale viewed on the Side of 
the Right Auricle. 

A. A Valve that throws itself on the Side of the 
Left Auricle. and appears closed up chiefly 
by a Continuation of the Membrane that lines 
this Auricle. 
B. The Place where this Valve leaves a Hole, which 
opens into the Left Auricle. 
|P_683
C. The Part contiguous to the Right Ventricle. 
[^An illustration of a foramen ovale of the heart on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 2. The same Foramen ovale viewed on the Side 
of the Left Auricle. 

A. The Valve drawn a little back, that the Hole 
may be seen. 
B. The Point to which the Valve ascended, when 
left at Liberty. 
C. The Part which leads to the Left Ventricle. 
[^An illustration of a foramen ovale of the heart on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 3. The Second Sort of Foramen ovale open 
in the Adult, and seen on the Side of the 
Right Auricle. 

It differs from the First Sort, in being more sunk 
in, or more approaching the Shape of a Funnel. 
[^An illustration of a foramen ovale of the heart on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 4. The same Foramen ovale of the Second 
Sort, seen on the Side of the Left Auricle. 

It differs from the same Side of that of the First 
Sort, by the Valve beginning to make the Goose- 
foot by its different Attaches, which much re- 
semble the Columns of the mitral Valves of the 
Heart. In the Figure I have added a Probe 
passed into the Foramen ovale from the Right 
Auricle to the Left. 
[^An illustration of a foramen ovale of the heart on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 5. The Foramen ovale of the Third Sort open 
in the Adult, viewed on the Side of the 
Right Auricle. 

This Sort differs from the preceding Two, by the 
Foramen ovale, nearly forming a Funnel. 
[^Illustration of a foramen ovale of the heart on a separate fold-out page. ^]
Fig. 6. The same Foramen ovale viewed on the 
Side of the Left Auricle, and Two Probes 
passed into its Aperture. 

This Sort differs from the preceding ones, by the 
Goose-foot formed by the Valve being much more 
compounded. 

|P_684
The Circle of Points A. marks the Place which 
answers the oval Cavity that is in the Right 
Auricle, and is the Cicatrix of the Foramen 
ovale at the Birth. 

The Women in whom I have found the Foramen 
ovale of the Second and Third Sort, were about 
60 Years of Age.

[}2. The Figure of the Canal of the Urethra determined 
by solid Injections. }]
THE Necessity I am under of founding frequently, 
and the Difficulties that I have sometimes met 
with in this nice Operation, have made me resolve 
scrupulously to examine the Figure of the Canal of the 
Urethra. 

I have made thereon a number of Experiments, 
Two of which I shall now describe. 

[}I. }]
I melted Resin with Wax, and injected this Li- 
quid through the Urethra. I filled the Bladder but 
half way with it, in order to preserve all the Wrinkles 
of the Canal. When the Injection was cold and 
solid, I cut through the Ossa innominata. I dissected 
the Left Side of the Canal and Bladder, and the 
Section of these Parts gave me Fig. the 1st, TaB III.
of which this is the Explanation. 

[}Figure 1. }]
A. The Glans. 
B. An Elbow. which the Ligamentum suspensorium
causes the Penis to make. 
|P_685
C. Folds, or Wrinkles, of the Bulb or of the Gulf 
of the Urethra. D. The Entry or Streights of the 
Prostate. E. The Gulf of the Prostate, or the Ve- 
rumontanum. F. Elbow, or Streights of the En- 
try into the Bladder. G. A Section of a Portion 
of the Bladder. H. A Section of the Pubis. I. The 
Root of the Left Corpus cavernosum cut through. 
[^An illustration of a male urethra on a separate page. ^]
[}II. }]
I injected another Subject with very thick Glue. I 
intirely filled the Bladder therewith through the Canal 
of the Urethra, until it was somewhat stretched. I 
let this Injection remain to the next Day, and then 
found it solid and elastic. I cut the Parts round it, 
as I had done in the preceding Subject; and after- 
wards I made an exact Division of the Injection: I 
put one half of it on Paper, in order to have its 
Shape exactly; and thereby I obtained the 2d Figure. 
To it I have added, in pricked Lines, a pretty exact 
Section of the adjacent Parts.

Pubis. C. The Cavity of the Abdomen. D. The 
Peritonæum. E. The Integuments of the Abdo- 
men. F. The Space between the Pubis and the
