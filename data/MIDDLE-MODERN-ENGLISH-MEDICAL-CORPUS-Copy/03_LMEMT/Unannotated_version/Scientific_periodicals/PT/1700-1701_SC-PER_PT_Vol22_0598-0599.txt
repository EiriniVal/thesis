[}V. An Extract of a Letter from Dr James Bur- 
rough, to Mr Houghton, F. R. S. concern- 
ing a Bulimia. }]
ABout a month ago at Stanton (seven miles off this 
place) a labouring man, of middle age, had for some 
time so inordinate an Appetite, that I had it attested 
to me from an Eye-witness, that he eat up an ordina- 
ry Leg of Veal roasted at a meal; and fed at such an 
extravagant rate for many days together: He would 
eat Sow-thistles, and divers other Herbs as greedily, du- 
ring the time his β λίμία lasted, as the Beasts that are 
wont to use such food; and all he could get was lit- 
tle enough to satisfy his hunger. I am told he voided 
divers Worms as long as an ordinary Tobacco-pipe, 
and some of them bigger about than the shank of a 
common Tobacco-pipe is. After which his Appetite

declined by degrees, till it came to be of a common 
rate with that of others. He can't do so good a days 
work now as he was wont, but has almost recovered 
his wonted strength again. 

Bury, Jun. 26. 1700.
