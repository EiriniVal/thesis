[}II. An Essay upon the Use of the Bile in the Animal 
Oeconomy, founded on an Observation of a Wound 
in the Gall-Bladder. By Alexander Stuart, 
M. D. Physician to her Majesty, and F. R. S. }]
[}The Case of Mr. Menzies, Sergeant in the Second 
Troop of Horse-Grenadier Guards, wounded in 
the Gall-Bladder, with the Appearances in the 
Body after Death, and the Symptoms during 
Life; with some practical Inferences drawn 
from it. }]
HE was wounded about Three o'Clock in the 
Morning, the 30th of October, 1728, and died 
the 5th of November following in the Morning, being 
the seventh Day after he was wounded, in the fortieth 
Year of his Age. 

Appearances in the Body, opened by Mr. Coldham, 
Surgeon, in the Presence of Messieurs Fiquel and 
Black, Surgeons, with several Gentlemen, and myself. 

I. The Abdomen appeared distended as in a Tym- 
pany, or Ascites, and the Skin of the Belly tinged 
yellow as Saffron in many Places. 

II. A triangular Wound appeared about two Inches 
on the right Side of the Navel, the Direction slanting 
upwards obliquely through the Integuments. 

III. The Belly being opened, discovered the Wound 
to have penetrated through the Peritonæum, and the 
Sword had slanted upwards from thence along the 
Omentum, grazing slightly upon it, which was super- 
ficially ruffled, but so as to be hardly perceivable. 

|P_342
IV. A small triangular Wound appeared in the Bot- 
tom of the Gall-Bladder, which had penetrated 
through the Membranes into its Cavity, but had no 
where wounded the Liver, nor any of the neighbour- 
ing Parts. 

V. The Gall-Bladder was flaccid or collapsed, 
containing only a few Drops of Gall, which, by 
pressing the Cystis slightly, flowed out into the Cavity 
of the Abdomen through the Wound. 

VI. The Guts throughout their whole Tract being 
distended, so as could be judged to triple the Extent 
of their natural Diameters, seemed to fill the whole 
Cavity of the Abdomen, so as to give the outward 
Appearance of a Tympany, or Ascites; which Disten- 
sion disappeared, and the Guts collapsed, upon making 
several Punctures with a Lancet in their Sides, to give 
Vent to the Air. 

VII. The rest of the Cavity of the Abdomen, which 
was not closely filled up by the distended Guts, con- 
tained a gross muddy Water, or Serum, intensely yel- 
low, or highly tinged with Gall, to the Quantity of 
three Quarts, as I was able to guess without mea- 
suring it. 

VIII. All the Guts and Contents of the Abdomen
were highly tinged with this yellow Liquor, but no 
other Part of his Body, out of the Contact of this 
Liquor, had the least Appearance of it. 

IX. No Inflammation appeared in any Part of the 
Guts, or in any of the Viscera, or Contents of the 
Abdomen, which were all sound and healthy. 

X. The Obliquity of the Wound through the Inte- 
guments, Muscles and Peritonæum, made it impos- 
|P_343
sible for the external Air to enter into the Cavity of 
the Abdomen that Way. 

[}The Symptoms during Life. }]
I was called the 2d Day of November about Eleven 
o'Clock in the Forenoon, being the fourth Day after he 
received the Wound. 

I. The Surgeons who had attended him from the 
Beginning, Messieurs Fiquel, Coldham, Wilkie and 
Black, being present, told me that his Belly had been 
distended, as I saw it, from the Beginning, giving the 
Appearance of a Tympany, or Ascites, and it conti- 
nued at the same Pitch of Distension, neither dimi- 
nished, nor sensibly encreased, to the Time of his 
Death. 

II. No Ructus or Flatus, upwards or downwards, 
nor Borborygmi, notwithstanding this Distension of 
the Belly. 

III. He never went once to Stool after he received 
the Wound, though pretty strong Purgatives and se- 
veral Clysters had been given for the three Days be- 
fore I came; and though no Opiat (which might have 
been supposed to have retarded their Operation) had 
hitherto been exhibited: Neither had those Purgatives 
nor Clysters, which I ordered afterwards, the least 
Effect. 

IV. He took what was thought a sufficient Quantity 
of Drink and liquid Food. 

V. He never slept, or but very little, by short Slum- 
bers, of about half an Hour, or an Hour at longest, 
and that very rarely, notwithstanding pretty large 
Doses of Opiats were given to procure Rest, after I 
came. 

|P_344
VI. The Wound in the Integuments never digested 
in the usual Manner; but looked flaccid, or flabby 
and pale, almost without Pus. 

VII. The Urine in very small Quantity, at most 
two or three Spoonfuls at a time, clear but yellow, as 
if tinged slightly with Saffron, and without Sedi- 
ment. 

VIII. His Pulse was full, strong and even, but not 
quick. 

IX. No feverish Heat to be felt in the Skin, on any 
Part of the Body. 

X. His Tongue not hard, rough or black, as in a 
Fever, but of its natural Colour, with a silky Driness, 
and very little Saliva. 

XI. He was not in the least delirious, from the Be- 
ginning to the Time of his Death. 

XII. He had some slight Fits of the Hickup the se- 
cond Day after I saw him, and some few Reachings to 
vomit; some Intermissions in his Pulse, sometimes one 
in 10, 15, 20, or 30 a Day before his Death. 

In order to make some Use of this Case, it is neces- 
sary to premise, that as Reasoning without a Founda- 
tion in Facts and Experiments, does rarely lead to any 
Certainty in Natural Knowledge, so Observations of 
Facts and Experiments themselves, would be, in a great 
Measure, fruitless, if we did not endeavour, by Rea- 
soning, to draw obvious, useful and practical Conclu- 
sions from them: In order to which, it must be ob- 
served, That the great Apparatus in the Liver and 
Spleen, two of the largest Viscera in the Body, con- 
fessedly designed for the Preparation and Secretion of 
the Bile; and the Place of the Intestines, into which 
it is immediately deposited, afford indeed a strong Ar- 
|P_345
gument for the universal Use of it in the Animal Œco- 
nomy; but do not directly point out what, or how 
many these Uses are, about which there has been a 
great Variety of Opinions. 

But this singular Case, which must have happened 
very rarely, if ever before (wherein none of the In- 
wards, or Viscera, but the Gall-Bladder only was 
wounded, and by that Wound nothing but the Gall
was lost or misplaced) by shewing how many Functi- 
ons in the Animal Œconomy were impaired or de- 
stroyed by the sole Loss or Want of it, does at the 
same Time point out or demonstrate the Use and Ne- 
cessity of it towards Health, or the Perfection of these 
Functions; and perhaps may lead to some Indications 
of Cure, in Cases wherein it is known to be deficient, 
faulty or redundant. 

There was no other apparent or assignable Cause for 
these various Symptoms during his Life, of Death it- 
self, and of those several Appearances in the Body dis- 
sected after Death, but this Wound in the Gall-Blad- 
der: And as this Wound could not affect any of the 
Parts, nor produce these Symptoms in any other Sense 
than as it gave Vent to the Gall into the Cavity of the 
Abdomen, and deprived the Cavity of the Intestines, and 
the Blood of it: Therefore from this Loss and Mispla- 
cing of the Gall, all these Symptoms and Appearances 
may justly be concluded to arise, and I think may be 
accounted for from that Cause in the following Manner. 

I. The Abdomen was distended, as in a Tympany, 
or Acites, from the Beginning, and the Guts appeared 
inflated to their utmost Diameters. 

It is true, that this Inflation and Distension happens 
to most a few Hours before Death, and to all soon 
|P_346
after Death, and ariseth from the Spring, or Elater of 
the Air included, getting the better of its Antagonist 
Spring, or Elater of the muscular Fibres of the Sto- 
mach and Guts, which have no longer the Assistance 
of the Blood and Spirits to contract them, and keep 
up their peristaltic Motion. But the Inflation and 
Distension here spoken of, was several Days before 
Death, and, as I have been told, the very next Day after 
he received the Wound, though the Pulse was appa- 
rently strong and equal, and therefore a Defect of Blood
and Spirits not to be suspected: And therefore it may 
be justly concluded, that the Influx of the Gall into 
the Cavity of the Guts, is as necessary to the Strength 
of their Contraction and Perfection of their peristaltic 
Motion, as that of the Blood and Spirits into their 
Sides; and that these three are the conjunct Causes of 
this Motion in Health, which would be defective by the 
total Want of any of them. 

Hence we see that in Scyrrhosities of the Liver, 
where the Secretion, and therefore the Excretion of the 
Bile is more or less defective; and in the Jaundice, 
where, by some Obstruction in the Biliary Ducts
after Secretion, a Part of it is forced back, and regur- 
gitates into the Blood, and very little of it is thrown 
into the Guts: I say, in those Cases we observe an 
uncommon Distension in the Guts, and Costiveness; 
which, if the Case proves incurable, terminates in an 
Acites, or Dropsy, in the Cavity of the Belly. 

It may also be worth while to enquire, whether 
that which is commonly called an Hysteric, or ner- 
vous Cholic, generally attended with a lesser Degree 
of such like Distensions, with Flatus's and Borboryg- 
mi; I say, whether this Distemper, wherein the ani- 
|P_347
mal Spirits are so much, and only accused, does not 
partly arise from a sluggish Secretion and Excretion of 
the Bile, occasioning a Defect in its Quantity; or 
from its Acrimony and great Viscosity, occasioned by 
its Stagnation in the Gall-Bladder; or from both 
these, as well as from a defective or unequal Distribu- 
tion of the Blood and Spirits in the Parts affected. In 
confirmation of which, I have generally observed, that 
at some time or other in the Cure, a great Evacuation of 
porraceous viscid Bile, brought away either by Art or 
Nature, as well as a great Profusion of pale Urine, finish 
ed the Cure for that Time. The Vomiting of porraceous 
Bile, very common in such Cases, proves the same; and, 
I believe, it is generally allowed, that the ferruginous, 
porraceous and black Colour of the Bile, are owing to 
shorter or longer Stagnations of it, chiefly in the Gall- 
Bladder, which the sedentary Life of those who are 
subject to these Cholics, will sufficiently account for, 
even if there was no other Error in their Way of li- 
ving; and whoever has observed the high yellow Co- 
lour and Contents of the Urine in a Jaundice, ari- 
sing from a Redundancy of Bile in the Blood, will 
readily acknowledge that an uncommon watery Pale- 
ness in the Urine, where no more than the usual Quan- 
tity of Fluids has been taken down to dilute it, does 
shew a Defect of Bile in the Blood; and I believe it is 
easy to account for the Flatus's, Borborygmi, Inversions 
of the peristaltic Motion, the Pila Hysterica, Palpi- 
tations, Scotomia, Vertigo, and other Symptoms of 
these Distempers, which are called Nervous and Hy- 
steric, from the same Cause. And hence it is, that 
Bitters and Steel, known Deobstruents of the Liver, 
and Correctors of the Bile, with gentle Chologogues 
|P_348
in very small Doses, are of so much Use in such Cases; 
though it be certainly true, that all strong stimulating 
Purgatives are very hurtful and improper. 

II. But to return to our Case, there was no Ructus's
or Flatus's upwards or downwards, nor Borborygmi, 
notwithstanding this Distension of the Belly and Infla- 
tion of the Guts. 

This, I think, shews very plainly that the Guts
had lost all Motion, and were Paralytic by a total 
Want of Bile only, as much as if their Nerves had 
been totally obstructed: For had any Motion remained 
in them, whether the natural and regular peristaltic 
Motion, or a preternatural convulsive one, the Con- 
traction of them either Way, would have propelled the 
contained Air from one Place to another, and would 
have occasioned Borborygmi, or would have expelled 
a Part of it upwards or downwards, when Nature 
had so much need of it to relieve the distended Guts, 
and Art had contributed to that Intention by Clysters 
and Purgatives given. 

Which serves to illustrate what has been said above, 
concerning the defective and convulsive Motion of the 
Guts in Hysterick Cases, where, through a Defect in 
the Quantity or Quality of the Bile, or from both 
these, the Motion of the Guts becomes defective, ir- 
regular or convulsive, but is not totally lost through 
a total Want of it, as in this Case. 

III. He never went to Stool after he received the 
Wound; and the strongest Purgatives and Clysters that 
could be reasonably given, had no Effect. 

This seems also to be owing to the Want or total 
Loss of the peristaltic Motion; and plainly shews, 
that the strongest purging Stimulus has not the Power 
|P_349
to restore it, without the Assistance of the Gall: For 
had it been in any Degree restored, the Belly would 
have fallen proportionally, and some Evacuation of 
what was lodged in the Primæ Viæ would have fol- 
lowed. 

If then the Power of Purgatives depends upon the 
Co-operation of the Bile, it will follow, that where it 
is most active or redundant, their Operation will be, 
cæteris paribus, greatest; and where it is unactive or 
deficient in Quantity, they will have proportionally 
a less Effect. Though it be true that a great Quantity, 
or morbid Acrimony of the Bile, by a too strong and 
violent Irritation, will bring the Intestines into such 
Spasms, as to stop all Excretion by Stool; and the 
strongest purging Stimulus added to it does only en- 
crease the Spasms and Costiveness; as in Bilious Cho- 
lics, which are always attended with exceeding Co- 
stiveness, not conquerable by the strongest Purgatives, 
if they be not joined with Opiats, to allay the Spasms, 
and obtund the Acrimony of the Bile. 

He took what was thought a sufficient Quantity of 
liquid Food and Drink; but if the Elater of the Guts, 
and their peristaltic Motion were lost, it is easy to prove 
that none of his Food or Drink could enter the Lacteals
for want of the peristaltic Motion; and therefore that 
he died starved. And this will account for all the rest of 
the Symptoms mentioned. 

To prove that this was his Case. All that have 
seen live Dissections, intended to shew the Nature of 
the peristaltic Motion, and the Course of the Lacteals, 
must have observed, that the Guts have an alternate 
Systole and Diastole, or Contraction and Dilatation 
called the peristaltic Motion, the superior Section 
|P_350
contracting itself, while the immediate inferior is di- 
lated; and this Motion is carried on in several Parts 
of the Guts at the same time; and the contracting 
Part, by expelling the Blood and Chyle out of its Sides, 
in its Contraction looks pale, while the Parts dilated 
look florid, and the Vessels full of Blood and Chyle. 

Now the Part contracting must necessarily force the 
Chyle from the grosser Parts of the Food or Aliments, 
towards the inner Surface of the Guts, where the per- 
forated capillary Extremities of the Lacteals in the 
villous Coat are ready to admit, or rather to absorb 
it by Attraction, as far as the larger and visible Branches 
of the Lacteals on the Coats of the Guts, into which 
it easily flows in the Time of Dilatation, or Diastole, 
which expands and unfolds these Vessels at that Time 
for its easy Reception; from which it is farther pro- 
pelled by the next Systole, or Contraction, into the 
primary or first Order of the Lacteals in the Mesen- 
tery; and by the same repeated Impulses of the 
contracting Sections of the Guts, is forced farther 
through the second Order of Lacteals in the Mesen- 
tery, into the Receptaculum Commune, and the Tho- 
racic Duct; assisted by Valves, and promoted by the 
incessant Motion of the Muscles, and of all the Con- 
tents of the Abdomen and Thorax in Respiration, it 
is at last poured into the subclavian Vein, for a perpe- 
tual Recruit of the Blood in a healthy State. 

But if the first Movers in this Series fail, that is, if 
the muscular Fibres of the Guts have lost their peri- 
staltic Motion, as in this Case, then the Expression, 
Absorption and Progress of the Chyle described, can- 
not succeed, the Blood must be deprived of its Re- 
cruit, and the Person die starved; which, as I have 
|P_351
said before, seems to have been this Person's Case, and 
will sufficiently account for the rest of the Symptoms 
above recited. 

First, His Want of Sleep, and the Inability of Opi- 
um to procure it, might be owing to a Want of Re- 
cruit of Chyle in the Blood: As we see that those 
who live sparingly, sleep very little, and those who 
feed plentifully, require by so much a greater Num- 
ber of Hours to sleep; and in all chronical Cases, 
where the Body ceaseth to be nourished, the Sleep also 
fails, and Opiats have but little Power; whereas in 
Children, where a great Part of their Food goes to- 
wards both Nourishment and Acretion, the greater Part 
of their Time is spent in Sleep. 

It may indeed seem difficult to conceive how a Want 
of Rest should ensue so soon after the Accident. But 
considering that the Loss of one Meal in a Day, espe- 
cially of Supper, to such as have been accustomed to sup, 
has occasioned fewer Hours Rest, in the following Night, 
it will follow, that such Persons require at least some 
small Recruit once in six or seven Hours, in order to rest 
their usual Number of Hours; and therefore in our Case, 
where all Recruit must have ceased soon after the Ac- 
cident, he might be sensible of the Impairment of 
Rest in six or seven Hours after it, and those about 
him might well observe the Encrease of that Symp- 
tom, at least in the following Night. 

Another Difficulty ariseth from the Observation of 
Swallows and Tortoises, &c. who sleep most in 
Winter, when they eat and drink nothing. In answer 
to which, there seems to be no Parity between the na- 
tural Constitution of their Blood and Humours, and 
that of Men: To these, and such like Animals, with 
|P_352
regard to Recruit and Nourishment, Action and Rest, 
the Spring and Summer are as one Day, and the Winter 
as one Night; and their Blood and Humours seem 
to be fitted by God and Nature, not only to bear, but 
even to require such long Periods of Rest and Action. 
And probably there is as little Parity between the 
Crasis and Constitution of the Blood and Humours of 
a healthy Person, and of those in soporous and cata- 
leptick Diseases, who are reported to have slept for 
Weeks or Months without Food of any kind: And 
therefore, I say, where the Crasis and Consistence of 
the Blood and Spirits are nearly the same, that is, cæ- 
teris paribus, he who feeds, and is nourished most, 
will sleep longest, & e contra. 

The Position here advanced is farther confirmed by 
the Inefficacy of the Opiats given, they being capable 
of entering into the Blood through the Pores of the 
Stomach in Contact with them; by which quick Pas- 
sage they have been observed to procure Rest soon after 
they have been applied outwardly, or taken down 
into the Stomach, as in this Case they may justly 
be supposed to have done: Though, for the Reasons 
above-mentioned, neither they nor any thing else 
could pass by the Lacteals: But as the Aliments could 
not pass that Way, viz. by the Pores of the Stomach, 
nor by the Lacteals into the Blood, there could be 
no Recruit nor Nourishment: And therefore the Opiats, 
though they did enter into the Blood by the Pores 
of the Stomach in Contact with them, could not 
procure Rest. Thus it would seem probable, that 
Opiats do procure their Effect by detaining the Chyle
crude longer than usual in the Mass of Blood, and 
thereby lengthening Sleep beyond the usual Time; 
|P_353
and that they are ineffectual where there is no Chyle
in the Blood to be detained. 

But to explain how Opiats do contribute to retain 
the Chyle and other Crudities in the Blood, longer 
than usual, would require a Disquisition too tedious 
for this Place: But their Power of retarding or sup- 
pressing all or most of the Secretions and Excretions; 
their palling or obtunding the Appetite; their enabling 
one to fast long, and supporting one in Journies and 
Labour for a long Time without Food (Effects well 
known to the Turks and Asiaticks in their Journies 
through Deserts, &c.) these, I say, and some other known 
Effects of Opium, do very much favour this Opinion. 

Secondly, The Want of Pus in the Wound was 
probably owing to a Want of Recruit of Chyle in 
the Blood; and the Flabbiness and Paleness of its 
Lips, to a Shrinking of the Parts for want of daily 
Nourishment. 

Thirdly, The small Quantity of Urine was pro- 
bably also owing to a Want of Recruit of Fluids from 
the Primæ Viæ: For these, in a healthy State, find 
their Way to the Urinary Passages very soon. The 
slight Tincture of Yellow, which it had, must have 
been from the Bile spilt in the Abdomen, and filtrated 
through the Duplicature of the Peritonæum, and Bot- 
tom of the Bladder: For it could not be supposed to 
derive its Colour from the Blood, into which no Bile
could now enter by the common Way. 

Fourthly, The Want of Saliva, and the silky Dri- 
ness of the Tongue, seems to have been owing to the 
same Cause, a Want of Recruit of Fluids in the Blood, 
and a Loss of so much of them as fell into the Ab- 
domen. 

|P_354
Fifthly, If it be supposed that such a small Wound 
through the Integuments and Muscles of the Abdo- 
men and the Peritonæum, was capable of producing a 
Fever, then his not having any Symptoms of a Fever, 
must be owing to a total Defect of Bile and Chyle in 
the Blood, none of which could enter the Lacteals
for want of the peristaltic Motion, as has been 
said. 

Lastly, The few Fits of Hickup, Reachings to vo- 
mit, and Intermissions in the Pulse in declining and 
dying Persons, seem to arise not only from a Defect, 
and therefore an unequal Distribution of the Blood
and Spirits, but chiefly from the Corruption and ir- 
ritating Acrimony of them, as the immediate Cause of 
Death in this and most other Case. Which will be 
farther explained in the following Pages. 

[}Objection I. }]
It may very reasonably be objected here, that the 
Ductus Hepaticus would carry a Sufficiency of Bile, 
for the Uses of the Animal Œconomy, into the Cavity 
of the Intestines, though none came by the Ductus Cy- 
sticus; and Nature seems to have provided the Ductus 
Hepaticus for this Purpose, that if any Obstruction or 
Defect should happen in any of these Secretory Channels, 
the Secretion and Excretion might go on for the Benefit 
of the Œconomy, in the other: As Nature has provi- 
ded two Kidneys, and double Organs of Sense, for the 
same Reason. But the Effect will not be the same in 
a Wound, which is the Reverse of an Obstruction; 
because by a perpetual Evactuation through it, such a 
Revulsion and Derivation is made, as drains and de- 
siccates all the neighbouring Parts, and either lessens 
|P_355
or entirely frustrates the Secretion and Excretion by 
them: And this we find to be true, where the Secre- 
tory Organs and Ducts concerned in the different Secre- 
tions, lie at a great Distance from one another; as in 
the Diabetes we generally see a very great Desicca- 
tion of the Salival Glands, a Defect of Saliva, and 
a perpetual Thirst; and Sweating and Looseness lessen 
the Secretion by Urine; an Issue drains and emaciates 
the neighbouring Parts; and it is mechanically de- 
monstrated by Bellini, that the Flux of the Blood, 
and of all the Humours, will be most and strongest 
towards the Part where the Resistance is taken off; 
as in Bleeding, to which this perpertual Flux of Bile, 
through the wounded Gall-Bladder, seems to have a 
great Affinity; and therefore would probably promote 
the Afflux of Blood and Secretion of the Bile so much 
and so strongly towards the Vessels, Glands, and Se- 
cretory Ducts leading to the Cystis, as very much to 
lessen, or totally to hinder the Secretion by the Ductus 
Hepaticus into the Guts by that Channel: And there- 
fore, in this Case, the whole of this useful Juice seems 
for this Reason to have been totally lost to the Animal 
Œconomy. 

[}Objection II. }]
Another Objection is, that as the Guts and other 
Contents, and even the Muscles and Integuments of 
the lower Belly, were highly tinged by the Bile, it 
is probable that some of it has got into the Cavity of 
the Guts, where it might, by its Stimulus, keep up 
the peristaltic Motion, and by the Lacteals get into 
the Blood, for the Use of the Animal Œconomy; as 
|P_356
it appears that some of it got into the Bladder in that 
Manner, and tinged the Urine. 

It is not unlike that this might happen when the 
Bile came to be very redundant in the Cavity; but in 
passing through the Interstices of the Vessels and Fi- 
bres of the Guts, as through a Filtre, the grosser, 
saline and sulphurious Particles of it, which are the 
most pungent and active Parts, must have been left 
behind; which the muddy Thickness, as well as Deep- 
ness of the Colour of the Liquor found in the Cavity 
of the Abdomen, compared with the transparent Clear- 
ness of the Urine of a much lighter yellow Colour, 
without Sediment, does seem to prove: And it is not 
likely that such a small Quantity of filtrated Bile, as 
may be supposed to have passed that Way, deprived of 
all its active Particles, could either in Quantity or Qua- 
lity be sufficient to assist in any Function of the Ani- 
mal Œconomy, whether Natural, Vital or Animal: 
And, in Fact, if any passed that Way, it appeared 
plainly insufficient to promote the Contraction and pe- 
ristaltic Motion of the Guts, which remained preter- 
naturally distended, as has been said, from the Begin- 
ning to the Time of his Death. 

[}Objection III. }]
It has been also objected, that an Animal which dies 
starved, dies delirious and feverish, the Experiment 
having been made on Cats and Dogs: And therefore 
this Person, who had no Fever, nor Delirium of any 
kind, cannot be supposed to have died starved. 

I will not dispute these Facts, especially the Expe- 
riments upon Cats and Dogs, though I have not made 
any myself, nor do I remember to have had any just 
|P_357
or accurate Account of the Symptoms of such who 
have died of Hunger and Thirst, in Sieges, and at Sea; 
though many Instances have been, and no Notice, 
that I know of, has been taken of their having died 
mad, delirious or feverish, though these Symptoms 
are so remarkable and affecting. But supposing these 
Facts, these Cases will differ very much from this 
before us: For an Animal starved to Death purely 
for Want of Food, has the Gall flowing conti- 
nually into the Cavity of the Intestines, unmixed 
and undiluted with Chyle, and from thence by the 
Lacteals into the Blood; so that in a few Days this 
acrimonious Juice must become more redundant there, 
than any other Humour; which joined with the con- 
stant Attrition of the Globules in Circulation, must 
soon render the Blood very acrimonious, rancid and 
alcalin; that is, must reduce the whole to a Mass of 
Putrefaction, capable of stimulating the Brain and 
Nerves, so as to produce a Fever, Delirium or Mad- 
ness: But in the Case under Consideration, no Gall
could enter into the Blood: And therefore this Degree 
of Putrefaction, and the Effects of it, could not hap- 
pen; though it must be owned, that, through a Want 
of Recruit and Dilution, a lower Degree of Putre- 
faction of the Blood and Humours must have followed, 
even in this Case, from the continual Attrition in Cir- 
culation; such at least as was sufficient to render the 
whole Mass in a few Days unfit for any of the Uses 
in the Animal Œconomy, or the Functions of Life: 
And therefore may be justly supposed to have been the 
immediate Cause of Death: For all the passive Prin- 
ciples or Materials of Putrefaction, being actually in 
the Substance of the Blood, and all the active Princi- 
|P_358
ples of Heat and Attrition being at work upon it to 
produce this Effect, it could not fail to be brought 
about in a few Days; and the same would happen to all 
Animals, is what is effete, corrupted or altered, so as 
to be unfit for the Use of the Animal, was not con- 
tinually carried off by the Emunctories, and a fresh 
Recruit daily supplied from the Primæ Viæ; which 
Evacuations and Supply being kept up in their due 
Quantity and Proportion, do effectually prevent all 
Putrefaction and Acrimony, and keep the Blood and 
Humours in their natural Temperature, commonly 
(though mistakenly) called Sweetness. 

It is not then a Defect in the Quantity of Fluids
which kills an Animal in Fasting, but a poisonous 
Acrimony, which the Blood and Humours naturally 
contract, for want of a fresh Recruit and equal Eva- 
cuation. Thus in chronical Distempers, where the 
Person appears extenuated and exhausted, the Quan- 
tity of the Fluids is certainly very small, yet enough 
to maintain Life for some Months or Years, being kept 
in some Degree of Sweetness or proper Temperature, 
by a certain Proportion of Recruit and Evacuation: 
But where the Recruit is entirely substracted, the 
Evacuations will be proportionally lessened: And there- 
fore the Quantity of Fluids may remain much the 
same, but the Quality will alter, and Putrefaction 
for the Reasons above assigned must take Place, and 
be the immediate Cause of Death, even long before the 
Mass of Fluids can be much diminished in Quantity, 
as in the Case before us. Which leads to the Answer 
of another Difficulty, viz.

|P_359
[}Objection IV. }]
How the Pulse should continue full, strong and 
equal for several Days, while the Person was in a 
starving Condition, and the Blood had no Recruit 
from the Primæ Viæ? 

This indeed would be very unaccountable, if the 
Waste of the Blood and Humours were supposed to con- 
tinue at the same Height as before the Accident, and 
the Evacuations by the Emunctories were the same as 
in perfect Health. In this manner the Contents of the 
Blood-Vessels would be soon wasted and exhausted: 
But Sanctorius's Observations and Experiments do shew, 
that the daily Recruits and Evacuations keep Pace with 
one another, and are nearly equal in 24 Hours in a 
healthy State: And therefore where the Recruits are 
plentiful, the Evacuations will be equally so; and 
where those are sparing the Evacuations are small; or 
where the Balance is cast too much of either Side, some 
Indisposition or Distemper must follow. There is no 
Exception from this Rule, but in Children, a Part of 
whose Nourishment goes to Acretion, and the Encrease 
of their Weight: Therefore in the Case before us, the 
Recruit being entirely subtracted, the Evacutions must 
have been little, or next to nothing: And therefore the 
Quantity of the Blood and circulating Humours would 
remain much the same, and keep up the Fulness, 
Strength and Equality of the Pulse for several Days, 
until the critical Putrefaction and Colliquation of the 
Blood above-mentioned, on the fifth or sixth Day, 
rendered it unfit for a regular Circulation, and pro- 
duced Intermissions in the Pulse, Reachings to Vomit, 
and Hickup, all of them being local Convulsions, and 
|P_360
the Effects of Corruption, Acrimony, Irritation, and 
an unequal Distribution of the Fluids, which termi- 
nated in Death in the Beginning of the seventh Day. 

The Sum of what has been said is, that in this Case 
very little, if any, Bile entered into the Intestines, 
and that ineffectual; and none at all into the Blood. 
And as there was no apparent Defect in any Part of the 
Body, nor any Wound that could have been either dan- 
gerous or deadly, in any other respect than as it gave 
Occasion to the Loss and Misplacing of the Gall; it 
is therefore evident, that all the Symptoms, and his 
Death, were entirely owing to the Loss of this useful 
Juice; which it seems is so necessary to all Parts of 
the Animal Œconomy, Natural, Vital and Animal, 
that this Person could not live above six Days with- 
out it. 

The practical Inferences that seem to flow by ne- 
cessary Consequences from this Observation, are, 

I. That the peristaltic Motion of the Intestines is as 
much owing to the Influx of the Bile into their 
Cavity, as to the Influx of the Animal Spirits and 
Blood into their Sides: And therefore that the Bile
is to be looked upon as one of the prime Movers in the 
animal Œconomy, by which the elastic Springs of 
the natural Motions, to wit, the muscular Fibres of 
the Guts are set to work; upon whose Motion all the 
subsequent vital and animal Motions do so far depend, 
that none of them can be long in Perfection where it 
is imperfect, nor subsist many Days where it is totally 
wanting. 

II. This prime Motion is totally lost by a total 
Want of Bile; proves sluggish by a Defect in its Quan- 
tity; becomes irregular or convulsive by a great Re- 
|P_361
dundancy or morbid Acrimony of it. From whence 
several Distempers that are called Nervous may arise, 
and are more likely to be cured by correcting and eva- 
cuating the redundant or faulty Bile, and disobstruct- 
ing the Liver, than by most other Medicines taken 
from the common Class of Nervines. 

III. That the Power of Purgatives depends upon 
the Co-operation of the Bile: And therefore it is 
probable, that the Difference of Constitutions, at equal 
Ages, with respect to Purgatives, depends more upon 
the Quantity and Quality of the Bile, than on the 
Bulk or Weight of the Body, Quantity of the Blood, or 
other circulating Humours. 

IV. It also appears that the Nourishment and Acre- 
tion of the Body do in some Measure depend upon a 
due Quantity and proper Quality of this Juice, with- 
out which the Blood and circulating Humours could 
not be recruited from the Primæ Viæ: And there- 
fore that Defects in it may be frequently the Cause of 
a Marasmus, or Waste of the Body, where it is little 
suspected: Which may serve to point out the Method 
of Cure in such Cases. 

V. This Observation seems to lead to the Know- 
ledge of the immediate Cause of natural Rest or Sleep 
in a healthy State; to wit, a certain Quantity or Pro- 
portion of fresh Chyle in the Blood; the Want of 
which, from whatever Cause, will occasion Watchful- 
ness, or some Degree of it. And this may serve to 
point out the immediate Effect and Consequences of 
Opiats, whence may be gathered how far, and in 
what Case they may be effectual and useful; and in 
what Circumstances they may be ineffectual, useless 
or hurtful. Which may deserve a farther Illustration. 

|P_362
VI. That a due Quantity of Aliments, at proper 
Intervals of Time, is necessary to keep the Blood and 
Humours in their natural Temperature and Sweet- 
ness, and to preserve them from Acrimony and Putre- 
faction: And this will be true in all Distempers as 
well as in Health, and is against the Practice of such 
as pretend to starve away Distempers, or to deny a 
due Quantity of Drink and liquid Food to the Sick, 
especially in Fevers, where the Want of this Re- 
cruit will tend to encrease the Acrimony or Pu- 
trefaction, whence the Malignity of most Fevers does 
arise. 

VII. That Pus, or Matter in a Wound or Ulcer is 
the Product of Chyle, and not of the Blood or Se- 
rum: Which has indeed been the received Opinion, 
though supported by no other Proof than the Simi- 
litude of Pus to Chyle. And as a great Redundancy, 
as well as a Defect of Pus, does sometimes retard the 
Cure of a Wound or Ulcer, this may serve to shew 
by what Means it may be encreased or diminished, to 
answer the Intentions of the Artist. 

This also makes it appear probable, that a great 
Redundancy of Chyle disposeth the Body to purulent, 
suppuratory and scrophulous Distempers; and seems 
to indicate the subtracting such Sorts of Food as af- 
ford a rich, gross or plentiful Chyle, and the admini- 
string of such Medicines as may strengthen Sangui- 
fication, and the other assimulating Powers, to assimu- 
late and thereby consume it; the Sanguification and 
assimulating Powers being manifestly weak, as the 
Chylification seems to be strong in all such Cases. 
And this seems to be the Reason why in Adults, 
as the Sanguification grows stronger, and in Age, as 
the Voraciousness of the Appetite, too common in 
|P_363
Youth, declines, these Distempers do often decrease, 
and at last wear out of themselves: Which shews 
what Assistances Art ought to contribute, to bring 
about the same Effect in a less Time. 

I must here own my Omission to open the Stomach
and Guts, in order to view the State of their Con- 
tents, where the Gall was entirely wanting, which 
might have given some Light to this Observation. 
This Omission happened through some Hurry at the 
Time, which I regret; but am apt to believe, that as 
most of his Aliments were Liquids, the Alterations 
would not have been very conspicuous or obvious to 
the Sight. And I hope it will not be impracticable to 
make some Experiments on live Animals for this Pur- 
pose, with more Care and Attention, for supply- 
ing what may have been defective in this Obser- 
vation.
