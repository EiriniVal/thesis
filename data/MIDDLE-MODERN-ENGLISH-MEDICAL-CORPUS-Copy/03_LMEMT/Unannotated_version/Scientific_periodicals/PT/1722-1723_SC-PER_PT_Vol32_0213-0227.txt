[}VI. A Letter to the Learned Dr. Caleb Cotes- 
worth, F. R. S. of the College of Physicians, 
London, and Physician to St. Thomas's Ho- 
spital; containing a Comparison between the Dan- 
ger of the Natural Small-Pox, and of that given 
by Inoculation. By James Jurin, M. D. R. S. 
Secret. }]
SIR, 

THE sincere and disinterested Regard for the Good 
of Mankind, which you have always manifested, 
as well in your extensive private Practice, as in that 
publick Post, which you have so long and so usefully 
fill'd, must affect you, I am sure, with a great and sen- 
sible Concern for the Destruction made among us by 
that terrible Calamity the Small Pox. We have seen, 
for some considerable Time past, above 100 Persons 
per Week in this City and Suburbs, taking one Week 
with another, to be carry'd off by this Disease; a Con- 
sideration certainly that ought to dispose us to enter 
into any Measures, by which we may reasonably hope 
to put some Step to the Progress of so cruel a Di- 
stemper. 

To this Purpose, Sir, the Method of Inoculation, 
which has lately been introduced among us, is strongly 
recommended on the one hand, and has been opposed 
with a great deal of Warmth and Zeal on the other. 
|P_214
I have no Inclination to enter into this Contro- 
versy; it is in better and abler Hands: but, as the 
Point in Dispute is of the utmost Importance to Man- 
kind, I heartily wish, that, without Passion, Preju- 
dice, or private Views, it may be fairly and maturely 
examin'd. In order to which, if the following Ex- 
tracts and Computations, concerning the comparative 
Danger of the Inoculated and Natural Small Pox, may 
be of any Use to your self, or to other impartial and 
disinterested Judges, I shall think my Labour well be- 
stowed. 

The Number of Persons, who have had the Small 
Pox by Inoculation here in England, is, by the best 
Information I have been able to collect, as follows. 

Inoculated by 
Dr. Nettleton61 
Claudius Amyand, Esq; Serjeant Surgeon 17 
Mr. Maitland, Surgeon 57 
Dr. Dover4 
Mr. Weymish, Surgeon 3 
The Reverend Mr. Johnson3 
Dr. Brady, at Portsmouth4 
Mr. Smith, Surgeon, and Mr. Dymer, 
Apothecary, at Chichester13 
Mr. Waller, Apothecary at Gosport3 
A Woman at Leicester8 
Dr. Williams at Haverford West6 
Two other Persons near the same Place 2 
Dr. French, at Bristol1 

In all — 182 

Out of this Number the Opposers of Inoculation 
affirm, that two Persons died of the Inoculated Small 
Pox; the Favourers of this Practice maintain, that their 
Death was occasioned by other Causes. If, to avoid 
|P_215
dispute, these two be allow'd to have died of Inocula- 
tion, we must estimate the hazard of dying of the In- 
oculated Small Pox, as far as can be collected from 
our own Experience, to be that of 2 out of 182, or 
one out of 91. 

The Reverend Mr. Mather, in a Letter dated March
10. 1721. from Boston in New England, gives an Ac- 
count, That of near 300 inoculated there, 5 or 6 died 
upon it or after it, but from other Diseases and Ac- 
cidents, chiefly from having taken the Infection in the 
common way by Inspiration, before it could be given 
them in this way of Transplantation . 

If, as we have done before, to avoid all occasion of 
dispute, we allow 5 out of these 300 to have died of 
the Small Pox by Inoculation, notwithstanding what 
Mr. Mather has said of their dying by other Acci- 
dents or Diseases; the hazard of Inoculation will 
thence be determin'd to be that of 1 in about 60. But 
here it must be observ'd, that by all the Accounts 
from New England, the Operators there appear not 
to have been so cautious in the choice of their Subjects, 
as here in England. For Mr. Mather tells us, that 
the Persons inoculated were young and old, from 1 
Year to 70, weak and strong ; and by other relations 
we are inform'd, that Women with Child, and others 
even in Childbed , underwent the Operation. Appa- 
rently the Greatness of the Danger they were in, from 
the Infection in the natural Way, which then raged 
among them with the utmost Fury, made them the 
more adventurous. 

We come now, Sir, to the second Part of our De- 
sign, which is to form an Estimate of the Hazard, 
which all Mankind, one from another, are under of 
dying of the natural Small Pox, that, by comparing 
this with the Hazard of Inoculation, the Publick may 
|P_216
be enabled to form a Judgment, whether or no the 
Practice of Inoculation tends to the Preservation of 
Mankind, by lessening the Danger to which they are 
otherwise liable. 

With this View I have consulted the Yearly Bills of 
Mortality, as far back as the Year 1667, being the 
Year after the Plague and the Fire of London, com- 
prehending to the present Time the Space of 56 
Years, from 42 of which I have given Extracts in the 
two following Tables. 

The first of these takes in the first 20 Years, distin- 
guishing for every Year the total Number of Burials, 
and likewise the Number that died of the Small Pox, in 
two separate Columns. The third Column shews, how 
many died of the Small Pox out of every Thousand that 
were buried; and the fourth Column represents the 
Proportion between those that died of the Small Pox, 
and the whole Number of Burials, by the nearest Vul- 
gar Fraction, having always 1 for the Numerator. 

The second Table gives the last 22 Years, after the 
same manner, and at the bottom of each Table is given 
the Total Number for each Series of Years, and like- 
wise the Number that died each Year, taken at a Me- 
dium, one Year with another: by which it appears, 
that the Proportion between the Number of those that 
die of the Small Pox, and the whole Number of Bu- 
rials, is very nearly the same, upon an Average for 
each Series of Years. 

The 14 intermediate Years between 1686 and 1701 
are left out, because in the Bills for those Years, the 
Accounts of the Small Pox and Measles are not di- 
stinguished, as in the preceding and following Years, 
but are join'd together in one Article, so that from them 
no certain Account can be drawn of the Number of 
Persons, that died of the Small Pox.

|P_219
By these Tables it appears, that upwards of seven 
per Cent. or somewhat more than a fourteenth part of 
Mankind, die of the Small Pox; and consequently the 
hazard of dying of that Distemper, to every individual 
born into the World, is at least that of one in four- 
teen. And that this Hazard encreases after the Birth, 
as the Child advances in Age, will appear from what 
follows. 

From this Estimate it is demonstrable, that, in the 
Case of Persons actually having the Small Pox, the 
Hazard that they run, one with another, of dying of 
that Distemper, is greater than that of one in fourteen; 
or, which is the same thing, there must be fewer than 
thirteen, that recover, for one that dies of the Small 
Pox. For since one fourteenth part of Mankind die 
of the Small Pox, and the other thirteen parts die of 
other Diseases; if these thirteen have all had the Small 
Pox, and recover'd from it, before they fell ill of those 
other Diseases of which they died, then just thirteen 
will have recover'd from the Small Pox, for one that 
dies of that Distemper: but, as it is notorious, that 
great Numbers, especially of young Children, die of 
other Diseases, without ever having the Small Pox, it 
is plain, that fewer than thirteen must recover from 
this Distemper, for one that dies of it. 

To determine exactly how many of these thirteen 
Parts of Mankind, die without having the Small Pox, 
is a very difficult Task: but is easy to see, that a 
considerable Deduction is to be made from them. 

In the first place, the two Articles of Stilborn and 
Abortive Children, which are put into the yearly Bills, 
as part of the Number of Burials, are unquestionably 
to be deducted. 

|P_220
With these two, Sir, you will not I believe, think it 
unreasonable to join the following Heads, which, by 
the best Information I can procure, comprehend only 
very young Children, or at most not above one or two 
Years of Age: Overlaid, Chrysoms and Infants, Con- 
vulsions, Horseshoehead, Headmoldshot, Teeth, Wa- 
ter in the Head, Worms, Rickets, Livergrown, Chin- 
Cough, and Hooping-Cough, which Articles in the 
Yearly Bills for 22 Years last past, amount at a Medi- 
um to 386 in each 1000, of the whole Number of 
Burials. 

It is true indeed, that, in all Probability, some 
small part of these must have gone thro' the Small Pox, 
and therefore ought not to be deducted out of the Ac- 
count: but then, on the other hand, as it is certain, 
that of the remaining 614/1000 of Mankind, that are above 
one or two Years of Age, there are great Numbers, 
that never have the Small Pox, it will I presume be 
judged to be no unequal Supposition, if I suppose all 
that are contain'd under the Heads abovemention'd, to 
have miss'd that Distemper, when by way of Com- 
pensation, I allow all the remainder of Mankind to 
undergo it; which Concession is so large, that it will 
abundantly make up for what I assume too much in the 
former Supposition. 

Allowing therefore, that out of every 1000 Chil- 
dren that are born, 386 die under one or two Years 
of Age, without having the Small Pox, and 72 do 
some time or other die of that Distemper; it follows, 
that the Hazard of dying of it, to the remainder of 
Mankind, above one or two Years of Age, who are 
all supposed to undergo that Disease sooner or later, is 
that of 72 out of 614, or nearly 2 out of 17: so that 
|P_221
no more, than between 7 and 8, can recover from that 
Distemper, for one that dies of it. And if any consi- 
rable part of the aforesaid remainder of Mankind, 
more than is allow'd for above, do escape having the 
Small Pox, then the Proportion of those that recover 
from it, will be still smaller. 

This Consideration shews the Fallacy of one plau- 
sible Argument, that has been often made use of on 
occasion of the present Disputes about Inoculation: 
Which is, that whatever be the Danger of dying of the 
Small Pox, to those that actually have that Disease, yet, 
as great Numbers of Persons never have the Small Pox 
at all, this Danger is what any particular Person may 
never be in; and therefore it will be Madness to under- 
go the hazard of Inoculation, be it great or small, in 
order to prevent a Disease, which possibly may never 
befal one. 

For if two parts in seventeen of all Mankind, that 
are above one or two Years of Age, must sooner or 
later die of the Small Pox, it is plain, that how many 
parts soever of these seventeen are supposed to escape 
that Distemper, the Mortality among the remainder, 
who undergo it, must in proportion be so much the 
greater. As for instance, if 7 parts escape having the 
Small Pox, and 10 undergo it, then 2 out of 10, or 1 
out of 5, that have the Small Pox, must die of that 
Disease. 

And as it can never be known, whether or no any 
particular Person be one of those, that are to have the 
Small Pox; his Hazard of dying of that Distemper, 
being made up of the Hazard of having it, and the Ha- 
zard of dying of it, if he has it, will be exactly the 
same, namely, that of 2 in 17, or 1 in 8 or 9, whether 
the proportion of Mankind, that escape having the 
Small Pox, be great or small. 

|P_222
But as what has been said concerning the Hazard of 
the natural Small Pox, is taken from an Account of 42 
Years; whereas the Hazard of Inoculation is estimated 
only from what has happen'd in the space of about 18 
Months, since which time it had its first Rise among 
us; it will perhaps be asked by some Persons, why 
we do not likewise make the Estimate of the hazard of 
the natural Small Pox, from the last two Years alone, 
without running back into so great a number of Years, 
before Inoculation was begun? 

To which we answer, that the Proportion of those 
that die of the Small Pox, varies so much in different 
Years, as appears from the Tables above, that it was 
impossible to come at any Certainty in this point, from 
the consideration of the two last Years alone: and if 
any one suspects us of Partiality in proceeding after the 
manner we have done, he need only cast his Eyes upon 
the second Table, where he will find, that the Morta- 
lity of the natural Small Pox, for the two last Years, 
has considerably exceeded the Medium we have de- 
termin'd, from taking in two and fourty Years. 

There is another Method, which, if it were put in 
practice in several large Towns, or Parishes, and for a 
sufficient Number of Years, would enable us to come 
at a nearer and still more certain Computation of the 
Proportion between those that recover, and those that 
die of the Small Pox: which is, to send a careful Per- 
son once a Year, from house to house, to enquire 
what Persons have had the Small Pox, and how many 
have died of it, in the preceding Year. This has been 
done by Dr. Nettleton the last Year, at several Towns 
in Yorkshire, &c. and the same was done at Chichester
for the same Year, to the 15th of October last, by a 
Person of Credit, whose Account was communicated to 
me by my learned and ingenious Friend, Dr. Whitaker. 
|P_223
Such another Account has been transmitted to me from 
Haverford West, in South Wales, by the Learned 
Dr. Perrot Williams, Physician in that Place. The 
Sum of these Accounts is as follows. 
Sick of the Small Pox.Died.Several Towns in Yorkshire— — 3405 —636Chichester — — —— — 994 —168Haverford West — —— — 227 —52Total 4626 —856
From which it appears, that, upon a Medium be- 
tween these Accounts, there died of the Small Pox al- 
most 19 per Cent.or nearly one in five, of Persons of 
all Ages, that underwent that Distemper. Which is 
the more to be remarked, for that out of 82 Persons, 
that had the Small Pox by Inoculation, the same Year, 
and in the Neighbourhood of the same Places, not one 
miscarry'd. 

Mr. Mather observes, in his Letter mention'd above, 
that out of more than 5000 Persons that had the Small 
Pox at Boston in New England, within little more 
than half a Year, near 900 died, which is more than 
one in six; and this Account added to those from 
Yorkshire, Chichester, and Wales, reduces the Propor- 
tion of those that die of the Small Pox to somewhat 
more than 18 per Cent. so that the Hazard of dying 
of that Distemper, to those who are taken ill of it, is 
that of one in between five and six, or something 
above two in eleven. 

The Result therefore, Sir, of these Computations is, 
that, if the same Proportions should still continue, as 
have hitherto been determin'd by Observation, we 
must expect, 

|P_224
That of all the Children that are born, there will, 
some time or other, die of the Small Pox, one in 
fourteen. 

That of Persons of all Ages taken ill of the natural 
Small Pox, there will die of that Distemper, one in five 
or six, or two in eleven. 

That of Persons of all Ages inoculated, without 
regard to the Healthiness or Unhealthiness of the Sub- 
ject, as was practised in New England, there will die 
one in sixty. 

That of Persons inoculated with the same Caution 
in the choice of the Subjects, as has been used by the 
several Operators one with another, here in England, 
(if we allow in the two disputed Cases abovemention'd, 
that the Persons died of the inoculated Small Pox) 
there will die one in ninety one. 

But if those two Persons be allowed to have died of 
other Accidents of Diseases, then we have shall have reason 
to think, as far as any Judgement can be made from 
our own Experience here in England, that none at all
will die of Inoculation, provided that proper Caution 
be used; as we are inform'd, on all hands, is the Case 
in Turkey: where out of many thousands, that, in the 
space of about fourty Years past, have been inoculated 
in and about Constantinople, by one Greek Woman, 
who still continues that Practice, notwithstanding her 
extreme old Age, not so much as one Person has mis- 
carried, as I am assured by the ingenious Dr. le Duc, 
a Native of Constantinople, who was himself inocula- 
ted there under the Care of his Father, an eminent 
Physician in that City.

POSTSCRIPT. 
SINCE this Paper was drawn up and communicated 
to the Royal Society, the following Account of 
the Success of Inoculation in and about Boston, in New 
England, was procured at my Desire, by my Inge- 
nious Friend Dr. Nesbitt, from Capt. John Osborne, 
who resided in that Town and Neighbourhood during 
the whole time of that Practice. I think proper to 
insert it here, as it confirms the Extract given above 
from Mr. Mather's Relation, and is a more particular 
Account of the Matter of Fact, than any that I have 
yet seen. 

In May, 1721. the Small Pox was, by the Provi- 
dence of God, brought into the Town of Boston; in 
June it began to spread pretty much, and in the 
Month of July it was got into most parts of the Town, 
and considerable Number of People died of it. At 
this time Inoculation was first put in practice by 
Dr. Boyleston, who then perform'd it upon his own 
Child and a Negro-Servant, who both did well; not- 
withstanding which, this Attempt gave great Uneasiness 
to the Neighbours. However the Practice went on, 
to the Number of about 40 Persons, one of which was 
a Woman [/1./] of about 40 or 45 Years of Age, who got 
well over the Small Pox, as her Husband publickly 
declared, but had been before troubled with Hyste- 
rick Fits, of which she died some little time after. 
When about 70 Persons had passed under the Opera- 
tion, myself and Wife, who had hitherto been at a 
Place called Roxbury, a Mile from Boston, went into 
|P_226
Town and received the Small Pox by Inoculation. We 
had it with all the Gentleness and Moderation that 
was possible, neither of us having an hundred Pu- 
stules, or being sensible of any Fever worth mention- 
ing; so that we did not find it necessary to keep our 
Beds for it. 

In August the Small Pox in the natural Way proved 
more mortal, and Inoculation made a greater Progress, 
the People continuing to come into the Practice of it. 
A second Person that died after Inoculation, was an 
Apothecary's Housekeeper, that was out of Town, 
till an Indian Maid got the Distemper in the same 
House, and remov'd, and died. Upon which this Wo- 
man coming to Town, her Master undertook to per- 
form the Operation upon her, which by the way was 
the first and last that he ever perform'd; and on the 
third Day after the Inoculation, the Small Pox came 
out upon her very full; from which it was plain, that 
she had taken the Infection before, in the common 
way. 

The third Person that died after being inoculated, 
was a [/2./] Gentleman, that lodged in the same House 
with my Wife and self at Roxbury, who was under 
great and extreme Infirmity of Body, as myself was 
Witness, that we fear'd he would have lived but a 
short time under it. His Friends much persuaded him 
to make use of Inoculation, believing that it would 
have carry'd off his Illness; but when he made the Ex- 
periment, he had not Strength to go thro' with it. He 
was about 45 Years of Age, and by the way was a 
Gentleman of great Worth and Piety. 

His Sister [/3./] was the fourth Person that died upon 
this Operation. She was about fourty Years of Age, 
|P_227
of great Indisposition of Body, and weak, as was her 
Brother. 

The fifth, that died upon Inoculation, was a Wo- 
man Servant in a House, where the whole Family, to 
the number of eight, were inoculated at the same time. 
She lay in a cold upper Room during her Illness, and 
was much neglected, the whole Family being down 
together, so that she died merely for want of a little 
Attendance. This was in the Town of Roxbury, 
where observe, that 13 Men, Masters of Families, got 
the Small Pox, and all died; which inclined the People 
to make use of Inoculation, having before been much 
against it, and there were 43 Men inoculated there, 
who all did well. The [/4./] Minister of the Town was 
the first, that put it in Practice there, much against the 
Mind of his People at first, though afterwards they 
were very well pleas'd with it, seeing with what great 
Success it was attended; and then whole Families came 
into it, and underwent the Operation. There were 
in all at least 280 Persons inoculated, that I knew of, 
and I suppose there might be about 20 or 30 more, but 
of those I can give no certain Account.
