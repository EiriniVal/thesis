[}IX. Extract of a Letter from Andrew Cant- 
well, M. D. Monspel. to Dr. Stack, dated 
at Montpellier, June 23. 1732. N. S. 
Containing an Account of a large Glandu- 
lar Tumor in the Pelvis; and of the perni- 
cious Effects of crude Mercury given in- 
wardly to the Patient. }]
ON the 7th Instant, I was called hence to Bal- 
leruc, to visit an English Gentleman, who was 
ill there. In the House where he lodg'd, was one 
P—r M—n, born in France, but settled in Ca- 
diz. This poor Gentleman, having been very ill these 
two or three Years last past, had lost the Use of his 
Left Leg and Thigh, was subject to frequent Head-achs 
and Pains in his Bones, but more especially in his 
Legs: For which, because he had been given to Wo- 
men, his Physicians in Cadiz salivated him twice, 
sent him to several hot Waters, and gave him all the 
Remedies they could imagine, but to no Purpose; for 
his Illness increasing, he had from time to time great 
Difficulty of making Water, and going to Stool. In 
this Condition he came from Spain to Marseilles, and 
from thence was sent to the Waters of Balleruc, of 
which he drank a great Quantity. But as they did not 
pass, his Physician there order'd him strong Purges, 
with Clysters of a Decoction of Tobacco, and the like. 
He then began to vomit his Excrements; upon which 
the Physician to the Marquis of C—'s Regiment 
in Spain, who happen'd to be there, order'd him half 
|P_140
a Pound of crude Mercury by the Mouth, which made 
him suffer the most exquisite Pains; and his Belly 
swell'd, and became as stiff as a Drum. Here Dr. 
Montagne was sent for, who soon discover'd the Er- 
ror in the preceding Practice, by feeling a solid Body 
near the Rectum, which obstructing the Passage, hin- 
der'd the Clyster-pipe from entering far enough into 
the Gut. After his Departure, the Patient was again 
order'd Clysters, which were injected with a crooked 
Pipe, and several Purges; till at the End of eight Days 
he died, having his Belly bigger, stiffer and harder 
than ever. Though I arriv'd the Day before his Death, 
I saw him not till after he expir'd. His Physician 
having invited me to open the Body, I willingly con- 
sented, curious as I was to find the solid Resistance or 
Tumor, which he could give no Account of. I sent 
for the Surgeon of the Village, who with a Bistouri
(the only anatomical Instrument he had) open'd the 
Abdomen by my Directions, which was fill'd with a 
whitish Liquor of some Consistence. The Epiploon
was all dissolv'd, and swam in this Liquor like so much 
Pus. This Water pour'd out, I examin'd the Intes- 
tines. The Colon was burst under the Stomach, and 
in three other Places at its lower Part; and so was the 
Coecum; the Ileum all inflam'd, and in one Part gan- 
gren'd. The Lips of the Ruptures were plaister'd 
with Excrements, all beset with a prodigious Number 
of Globules of Quicksilver; and when the Intestines 
were disengaged and taken out, the Quicksilver fell 
from them in large Drops. The other Viscera were 
in the natural State, except the Liver, which was gan- 
gren'd. As I was very solicitous about the Tumor, I 
look'd into the Pelvis, where I found an Excrescence 
|P_141
of a prodigious Size, which fill'd all its Left Side. I took 
the Knife, and clear'd all round the Tumor; whereby 
I found the urinary Bladder close pent up between the 
anterior Part of the Tumor and the Ossa pubis, which 
occasion'd the Strangury the Patient had been tor- 
mented with: The Rectum, which lay upon the Mid- 
dle of the Os sacrum, was also vastly press'd on by 
the Tumor, which seem'd to take its Rise from the 
Holes that are in the Left Side of that Bone. The 
Surgeon was so unluckily impatient, that while I laid 
down the Knife, in order to separate the Ossa pubis
with a Hatchet, he cut out the Tumor. I then exa- 
min'd the Os sacrum, which was so very soft, that my 
Fingers enter'd it every where on the Left Side. The 
Tumor is of an ovoïde Figure, cover'd over with se- 
veral Membranes: Its Weight is two Pound and an 
half; its longest Axis is five Inches and somewhat more 
than three quarters, French Measure; its shortest four 
Inches three quarters. At first Sight I took it for a Pa- 
renchyma, but, upon Dissection, found it analogous to 
the Liver in Substance, Colour and Consistence. Its 
Artery, Vein and Nerve are very big, and are distri- 
buted through its whole Substance: Wherefore I 
really take it to be one of the conglobate Glands of 
the Pelvis, whose Vessels yielding to the Blood im- 
pell'd thither with greater Force and in larger Quan- 
tity than usual, on account of the violent Exercises of 
Dancing, Jumping, &c. which the Patient very much 
practis'd, gave Room to its Increase to that enormous 
Size. Upon opening, I remark'd three very apparent 
Divisions in it: And where the Psoas lay over it, and 
one of the Pyramidales beat upon it, it was ossified. 
I preserve it in Brandy, and find that the small Vessels, 
|P_142
that were most fill'd with Blood, press it out into the 
Interstices of the neighbouring ones. 

The Weight the Patient constantly complain'd of 
at his Left Hip; the Difficulty he had in going to Stool, 
and that of thrusting a Syringe far enough into the 
Rectum to give him a Clyster with any Success; the 
Tumor itself, which was easily felt upon putting the 
Finger into the Anus; together with the Palsy of the 
Left Leg and Thigh, might, I think, have given other 
Indications to the Physicians, than those they took. 
And, in my humble Opinion, the Frictions and other 
heating Medicines the Patient was ply'd with, contri- 
buted to augment his Illness. In fine, the crude Mer- 
cury he swallow'd, the vast Quantity of Balleruc Wa- 
ter he drank before it, with the strong Cathartics taken 
by the Mouth and Anus, seem to have cut him short 
of some Months, which he might have liv'd, had he 
used no other Remedies than a slender relaxing Diet.
