[}V. A Relation of an extraordinary sleepy Person, at 
Tinsbury, near Bath. By Dr William Oliver, 
F. R. S. }]
MAy the 13th, Anno 1694, one Samuel Chilton, of Tins- 
bury near Bath, a Labourer, about 25 years of age, 
of a robust habit of Body, not fat, but fleshy, and a dark 
brown Hair, happen'd, without any visible cause, or evi- 
dent sign, to fall into a very profound Sleep, out of 
which no Art used by those that were near him, cou'd 
rouze him, till after a months time; then rose of him- 
self, put on his Cloaths, and went about his business of 
Husbandry as usual; slept, cou'd eat and drink as before, 
but spake not one word till about a month after. All 
the time he slept Victuals stood by him; his Mother fear- 
ing he wou'd be strarv'd, in that sullen humour, as she 
thought it, put Bread and Cheese and Small Beer before 
him, which was spent every day, and supposed by him, 
tho no one every saw him eat or drink all that time. 

From this time he remain'd free of any drowsiness or 
sleepiness till about the 9th of April 1696, and then fell 
into his Sleeping fit again just as he did before. After 
some days they were prevail'd with to try what effect 
Medicines might have on him, and accordingly one 
Mr Gibs, a very able Apothecary of Bath, went to him, 
Bled, Blister'd, Capp'd and Scarrified him, and used all 
the external irritating Medicines he could think on, but 
all to no purpose, nothing of all these making any man- 
ner of impression on him; and after the first fortnight he 
was never observ'd to open his Eyes. Victuals stood by 
|P_2178
him as before, which he eat of now and then, but no 
body ever saw him Eat or Evacuate, tho he did both 
very regularly, as he had occasion; and sometimes they 
have found him fast asleep with the Pot in his Hand in 
Bed, and sometimes with his Mouth full of Meat. In 
this manner he lay for about ten weeks, and then could 
eat nothing at all, for his Jaws seem'd to be set, and his 
Teeth clincht so close, that with all the Art they had with 
their Instruments they cou'd not open his Mouth, to put 
any thing into it to support him. At last, observing a hole 
made in his Teeth, by holding his Pipe in his Mouth, 
as most great Smoakers usually have, they through a 
Quill pour'd some Tent into his Throat now and then: 
And this was all he took for six weeks and four days, 
and of that not above three pints or two quarts, some of 
which was spilt too; he had made water but once, and 
never had a stool all that time. 

August the 7th, which is seventeen weeks from the 9th 
of April, (when he began to sleep,) he awaked, put on 
his Cloaths, and walkt about the Room, not knowing 
he had slept above a night, nor cou'd he be perswaded 
he had lain so long, till going out into the Fields he 
found every body busy in getting in their Harvest, and 
he remember'd very well, when he fell asleep they were 
sowing of Barley and Oats, which he then saw ripe and 
fit to be cut down. 

There was one thing observable, That tho his Flesh 
was somewhat wasted with so long lying in Bed, and 
fasting for above six weeks, yet a worthy Gentleman his 
Neighbour assured me, when he saw him, which was 
the first day of his coming abroad, he lookt brisker than 
ever he saw him in his life before; and asking him whe- 
ther the Bed had not made him sore, he assured him and 
every body, that he neither found that, nor any other in- 
conveniency at all; and that he had not the least remem- 
|P_2179
brance of any thing that past or was done to him all that 
while. So he fell again to his Husbandry as he used to 
do, and remain'd well from that time till August the 17th, 
Anno 1697, when in the morning he complain'd of a 
shivering and coldness in his Back, vomited once or twice, 
and that same day fell into his Sleeping fit again. 

Being then at the Bath, and hearing of it, I took Horse 
on the 23d, to inform my self of a matter of fact I 
thought so strange. When I came to the House, I was 
by the Neighbours (for there was no body at home at 
that time besides this sick man,) brought to his Bed-side, 
where I found him asleep, as I had been told before, 
with a Cup of Beer and a piece of Bread and Cheese upon 
a Stool by his Bed within his reach: I took him by the 
Hand, felt his Pulse, which was at that time very regu- 
lar; I put my Hand on his Breast, and found his Heart 
beat very regular too, and his breathing was easie and 
free; and all the fault I found was, that I thought his 
Pulse beat a little too strong: He was in a breathing Sweat, 
and had an agreeable warmth all over his Body. I then put 
my Mouth to his Ear, and as loud as I cou'd called him by 
his Name several times, pull'd him by the Shoulders, pincht 
his Nose, stopt his Mouth and Nose together, as long as 
I durst, for fear of Choaking him, but all to no purpose, 
for in all this time he gave me not the least signal of his 
being sensible. I lifted up his Eye-lids, and found his 
Eye-balls drawn up under his Eye-brows, and fixt with- 
out any motion at all. Being baffled with all these tryals, 
I was resolv'd to see what effects Spirit of Sal Armoniac
would have, which I had brought with me, to discover 
the Cheat, if it had been one; so I held my Viol under 
one Nostril a considerable time, which being drawn from 
Quick-lime, was a very piercing Spirit, and so strong I 
could not bear it under my own Nose a moment without 
making my Eyes water; but he felt it not at all. Then I 
|P_2180
threw it at several times up that same Nostril, it made 
his Nose run and gleet, and his Eye-lids shiver and trem- 
ble a very little, and this was all the effect I found, tho 
I pour'd up into one Nostril about a half ounce Bottle of 
this fiery Spirit, which was as strong almost as Fire itself. 
Finding no success with this neither, I cramm'd that 
Nostril with Powder of White Hellebore, which I had by 
me, in order to make my farther trials, and I can hardly 
think any Impostor cou'd ever be insensible of what I did. 
I tarried some time afterwards in the Room to see what 
effects all together might have upon him; but he never 
gave any token that he felt what I had done, nor disco- 
ver'd any manner of uneasiness, by moving or stirring 
any one part of his Body, that I could observe. Having 
made these my Experiments I left him, being pretty well 
satisfied he was really asleep, and no sullen Counterfeit, as 
some people thought him. 

Upon my return to Bath, and relating what I had ob- 
serv'd, and what proofs this Fellow had given me of his 
Sleeping, a great many Gentlemen went out to see him, 
as I had done, to satisfie their Curiosity in a Rarity of that 
Nature, who found him in the same condition I had left 
him in the day before; only his Nose was inflamed and 
swelled very much, and his Lips and the inside of his 
Right Nostril blister'd and scabby, with my Spirit and 
Hellebore, which I had plentifully dos'd him with the day 
before: His Mother upon this for some time after wou'd 
suffer no body to come near him, for fear of more Expe- 
riments upon her Son. About ten days after I had been 
with him, Mr Woolmer, and Experienc'd Apothecary at 
Bath, called at the House, being near Tinsbury, went up 
into the Room, finding his Pulse pretty high, as I had 
done, takes out his Launcet, lets him Blood about four- 
teen ounces in the Arm, tyes his Arm up again, no body 
being in the House, and leaves him as he found him; 
|P_2181
and he assured me he never made the least motion in the 
world when he prickt him, nor all the while his Arm was 
bleeding. 

Several other Experiments were made by those that 
went to see him every day from the Bath, but all to no 
purpose, as they told me on their return: I saw him 
my self again the latter end of September, and found him 
just in the same posture, lying in his Bed, but remov'd 
from the House where he was before about a furlong or 
more; and they told me, when they remov'd him, by ac- 
cident, carrying him down Stairs which were somewhat 
narrow, they struck his Head against a Stone, and gave 
him a severe knock, which broke his Head, but he never 
mov'd any more at it than a dead man wou'd. I found now 
his Pulse was not quite so strong, nor had he any Sweats, 
as when I saw him before. I try'd him again the second 
time, by stopping his Nose and Mouth, but to no pur- 
pose; and a Gentleman then with me ran a large Pin in- 
to his Arm to the very Bone, but he gave us no manner 
of tokens of his being sensible of any thing we did to 
him. In all this time they assured me no body had seen 
him either eat or drink, tho they endeavour'd it all they 
could, but it always stood by him, and they observ'd 
sometimes once a day, sometimes once in two days all 
was gone. 'Tis farther observable, he never foul'd his 
Bed, but did his necessary occasions always in the Pot. 

In this manner he lay till the 19th of November, when 
his Mother hearing him make a noise, ran immediately 
up to him, and found him Eating; she askt him how he 
did? He said, Very well, thank God: She askt him 
again, Which he lik'd best, Bread and Butter, or Bread 
and Cheese? He answer'd, Bread and Cheese: Upon this, 
the poor Woman overjoy'd left him to acquaint his Bro- 
ther with it, and they came strait up into the Chamber 
to discourse him, but found him as fast asleep again as 
|P_2182
ever, and all the Art they had cou'd not wake him. From 
this time to the end of January or the beginning of Fe- 
bruary, (for I cou'd not learn from any body the very day) 
he slept not so profoundly as before, for when they call'd 
him by his name he seemed to hear them, and be some- 
what sensible, tho he could not make them any answer. 
His Eyes were not now shut so close, and he had fre- 
quently great tremblings of his Eyelids, upon which they 
expected every day when he would wake, which happen- 
ed not till about the time just now mention'd, and then 
he wak'd perfectly well, not remembring any thing that 
happened all this while. 'Twas observ'd he was very 
little altered in his Flesh, only complained the Cold pincht 
him more than usually, and so presently fell to Husbandry 
as at other times. 

I have no reason to suspect this to be any Cheat, be- 
cause I never heard of any gain to the Family by it, tho 
so near the Bath, and so many People went thither out 
of Curiosity to see the Sleeper, who when awake was a 
support to his old Mother by his Labour, but now a cer- 
tain charge to her. Besides there was seldom any body in 
the House to attend any profit might be made by it, he 
being left alone in the House, and every body at liberty 
to go up to his Bed-side.
