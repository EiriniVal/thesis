[}VI. Part of a Letter from Tho Short, M. D. 
to Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. Pr. R. S. concern- 
ing an extraordinary Impostumation of the 
Liver. }]
Honoured Sir, 
Sheffield, June 11. 1731. 

******I Had a Patient, who died lately of an Im- 
postumation of the Liver: I open'd him, 
and out of the lowest and thinnest Lobes I took 
six Quarts of purulent, thick, most intolerably 
fetid, reddish-brown Matter, very acid; for no 
sooner was it exposed a little to the open Air, than 
it fermented exceedingly. The Patient had drain- 
ed off the thinner Part the last Week of his Life 
by violent Vomiting; and purging to thirty or forty 
Stools a Day, and as many Vomits, it was thrown 
into the Duodenum by the Ductus Cholidochus com- 
munis, and there pumped up and thrown out, both 
by its Sharpness and Stimulation. All the upper 
Part of the Liver to about an Inch below the Gall- 
bladder was sound. The Tumour had so compressed 
the right Kidney, that it was emaciated away to less 
than the Glandula Renalis. *** From, 

SIR, 

Your most obliged humble Servant, 
Tho. Short.
