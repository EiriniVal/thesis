[}An extraordinary Case in Surgery, communicated 
by Mr. Joseph Atkinson Senior, Surgeon. }]
A Maiden, about 20 Years of Age, was brought to 
me about Christmas 1723; who had a Tumour 
on the inside of her right Thigh, extending from the 
Groin to the Knee, which was so large, that I judg'd 
it contained at least the Quantity of a Gallon; the 
Cutis was exceedingly distended, but of the natural 
Colour, only, the capillary Veins appear'd varicous, 
and very numerous; she had also a large Tumour on 
the Buttock of the same Side, of the Bigness of a 
Quartern Loaf; but when the Tumour on the Thigh 
was pressed, the Tumour above very much encreas'd, 
which shew'd a Communication, and prov'd after- 
wards so to be: She had also another Tumour on her 
right Side, stretching from the left Side of the Ver- 
tebræ of the Back to the Hypochondrium, about the 
Bigness os a Penny Loaf, her Body was very much 
emaciated, and she could hardly breathe, and the little 
Victuals she eat very difficultly passed out of the Sto- 
mach. She had had the Menses but twice or thrice, 
about 12 Months before the Beginning of those Tu- 
mours, and it is to be marked, that the Tumour of her 
Thigh began first, and increased to near the Magni- 
tude I first saw it, before the Tumour of the Buttock 
and Hip began; after that, the Tumour of her Back 
began, which, as it increas'd, brought on great Diffi- 
culty in Breathing. She had been with several other 
Persons, who advised against opening the Tumour of 
her Thigh, most of them being of the Opinion it 
was from Blood, and that her Case was incurable: I 
|P_341
confess, I was of a contrary Opinion; but being told 
what so many others had said, I declin'd meddling 
with it at that Time, though her Parent and herself 
were willing to it: At this Time I dismissed her, saying, 
that, if she liv'd, a little Time wou'd discover more of 
her Case. About two Months after I was desired to 
visit her again, which I did, but the Tumours were 
so monstrously increased, and her Body so wasted, 
that I wonder'd she could live under such Circum- 
stances; the Tumour of the Thigh was every Way 
yielding to the Pressure of the Finger, nor was there 
the least Hardness about the Extremities of it, so that 
it might be easily mistaken for an Aneurisma, had it 
not wanted the grand Characteristick, Pulsation, which 
some say, is not to be felt when those are very large, 
the Middle of this then look'd a little red, and shin- 
ing, and seem'd to point a little; I told them I be- 
lieved it would break with a small Orifice, and shew 
what was contain'd, willing them to notify it to me 
if such a Thing happen'd: Three Days after they call'd 
me in haste to this Patient, saying, the Swelling of 
her Thigh was broke; when I came, I found there 
had been discharg'd a small Quantity of matterish 
Substance, much like what is contain'd in a Meliceris, 
but the Opening was so small or closed, that I could 
not enter my Probe; however, though she seem'd 
to me ( and to Mr. Wall, an Apothecary then 
present) to be ready to expire, yet, at the De- 
sire of her Parents, I open'd this Tumour with my 
Launcet, making an Incision about an Inch and 
an half long, through which poured three Pint 
Basons full of Matter, besides several smaller, which 
together contain'd about five Quarts, it was very fœ- 
tid and bloody towards the latter End of this Dis- 
charge; upon this, the Tumour wholly subsided, in- 
|P_342
somuch that the Thigh instantly became as small as 
the other; I put my Finger into the Wound, and 
found the Fascia lata quite consum'd, the Muscles lay 
all loose, so that I fairly touch'd the Thigh-Bone be- 
tween them, as I would. 

But I should acquaint you, that, immediately upon 
the Discharge of this Humour, the Tumour on the 
Buttock was considerably abated, but there followed 
about two or three Spoonfuls of florid Blood; I dress'd 
it up for this Time with a proper Digestive, and a 
suitable Bandage; the Day following I visited her 
again, and found she had slept pretty well, and was 
much refresh'd, and not the least Faintness had at- 
tended her, during my Absence, which shews the ima- 
ginary Synocope, that is feared to follow such, Evacu- 
ations, to be groundless; the Day following, tak- 
ing off my Dressings, I found the Limb, in its Figure, 
bigger than the other; at the third Dressing there 
appear'd a small hard Swelling a little below the 
Orifice, which was made by some grumous Blood 
that lay there, which I turn'd out with my Finger, 
in Quantity about four Ounces, this was follow'd 
by a florid Blood, which much surprised me; I then 
judg'd this proceeded from some Hypogastrick Vessel 
that supplied this Tumour, and I despair'd of Suc- 
cess, unless I could meet with this Spring; so, in or- 
der to it, I laid open the Sinews to the Groin, and, 
though I could not discover the Vessel, yet I so suc- 
cessfully applied my Astringent, that from that 
Time it bled no more; however, there was, for a 
Week, a great Flowing of a ferous Matter, which 
wholly sunk the Tumour of the Buttock and Hip, 
and, by boulstering and compressing with suitable Ban- 
dage, the so long separated Cutis clos'd with the 
|P_343
Muscles, and all Things, in about a Fortnight, seem'd 
to be in a fair Way of healing, yet, it was near three 
Months, before this Cure was compleated. 

But still (that is, a Fortnight after the Opening of 
the Thigh) the Tumour on her Back continu'd, and 
she much straitened for Breath; saying, if that was 
opened, she should be presently reliev'd; this Tumour 
I then open'd (which was, I said, as big as a Penny 
white Loaf, and there issued out about two Quarts 
of Matter, or rather more: I was again greatly sur- 
prised that such a Quantity, so much more than 
what possibly this visible Tumour could contain, 
should run out of this Orifice; I enter'd my Probe, 
and found it penetrate into the Cavity of the Thorax, 
between the second and third spurious Rib, reckon- 
ing from beneath, on which she respired with all 
Freedom, but there was a Halitus at this Wound; I 
continu'd to dress this and believe, before this tend- 
ed towards Healing, not less (at Times) than a Gal- 
lon, or rather five Quarts of Matter, was discharg'd; 
but, when I thought all was over, it filled again, the 
external Tumour became almost as big as before, 
and her Breathing as difficult as ever, so that I now 
thought all my Labour had been in vain; yet I open'd 
it again with a larger Orifice, and from that Time 
dressed it successfully, to the perfect Healing; the 
Menses are return'd, the Patient continuing well to 
this Day, and in a good State of Health. This Patient 
has been viewed by Mr. John Douglass, and he has 
had an ample Account of this Affair.
