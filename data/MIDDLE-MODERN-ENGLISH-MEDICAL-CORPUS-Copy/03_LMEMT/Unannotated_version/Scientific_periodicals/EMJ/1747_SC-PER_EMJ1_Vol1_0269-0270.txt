[}XXXVI. A Retention of the Seed in Coition; by 
William Cockburn M. D. and Fellow of 
the Royal Society. }]
A Noble Venetian, aged twenty two Years, 
was married to a very fine Lady, with 
whom he cohabited with a good deal of Vi- 
gour, but never could emit Seed in the Coiti- 
on; whereas in his Dreams he could discharge 
very freely. This Misfortune very much af- 
flited him and his Family; and as no Remedy 
could be found at Home, the Venetian Ambas- 
sadors residing in the different Courts of Europe, 
were desired to consult some of the most emi- 
nent Physicians in the Parts where they resided, 
to account for the Causes, and to find out a

Cure for this extraordinary Complaint of the 
Difference of the States when in Sleep, and 
when actually in Coition. 

I was of Opinion it consisted altogether in 
the Urethra, being closely shut up by Vigour 
of the Erection in Coition, which formed so 
great a Resistance, that the Powers which throw 
the Seed out of the Vesicul√¶ Seminales could 
not overcome it; whereas in Dreams the Pres- 
sure on the Urethra being much less, an Eva- 
cuation was made. 

The Method of Cure was not less successful 
than obvious, from the foregoing Account; 
for gentle Evacuations, and a slender Diet 
brought about, and fully compleated their De- 
sires.
