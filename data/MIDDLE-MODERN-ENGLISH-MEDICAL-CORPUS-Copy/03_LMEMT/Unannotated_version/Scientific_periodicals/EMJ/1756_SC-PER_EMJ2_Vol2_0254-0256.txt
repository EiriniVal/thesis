[}An Account of an uncommon Effect of antimo- 
nial wine; by Dr. James Walker Sur- 
geon and Agent for the Navy at Edin- 
burgh[/1./]. }]
THE vinum benedictum is universally 
known to be a strong emetic, when 
given in a large dose; and it has also been 
often prescribed in smaller quantities as an 
attenuant, sudorific, and diuretic: but an 
accident lately discovered to me a very diffe- 
rent effect of it, from any of the above 
mentioned. 

Being one evening, in December 1755, 
a little hot and feverish, with a quick and full 
pulse, I went early to bed, and drank a full 
English pint of sack-whey which I had order- 
ed one to make for me. Very soon after 
this, I fell asleep, and continued all night 
oppressed with an unusual drowsiness: at ten 
next morning, I with great difficulty got so 
far the better of this lethargic disposition, as 
|P_255
to get out of bed; when I found myself still 
heavy and inclined to sleep, with a lassitude 
and numbness in my limbs, so that I could 
scarce stand. Being thus incapable to go a- 
bout business, I resolved to ride out on horse- 
back; and having mounted with some diffi- 
culty, found my head very giddy, and had 
much ado to keep myself from falling asleep. 
After having rode three hours, I returned 
home much in the same situation, and was 
surprized to find two apprentices with the 
same complaints I had myself: they could 
assign no cause of their being so affected, nor 
had they eat any thing but their usual food, 
except the curd of which I had got the whey. 
Being led by this to suspect something un- 
common in the wine with which the posset 
was made; I called for it, and had a bottle 
brought me containing vinum benedictum, 
which had been made about a month before; 
and the bottle having been put in an impro- 
per place, was the reason of its having been 
mistaken for Lisbon. I found I had drank 
in my whey about a gill and a half of this e- 
metic wine, and was surprized it had not vo- 
mited me strongly. Thinking, however, that 
the finely attenuated particles of the antimony 
|P_256
might be mostly suspended in the curd, I 
inquired particularly at the two young Gen- 
tlemen who had eat it, whether they were 
affected with any nausea or vomiting; but 
they told me they found no other effect but a 
heaviness and great inclination to sleep. This 
drowsiness continued with them two days; 
but I did not find myself quite free of it at 
the end of four days. I do not know if it be 
worth while to observe, that the day after I 
had drank the above whey, my pulse was ten 
in the minute slower than it had been the 
night before. It may be proper however to 
take notice, that the vinum benedictum which 
was used, by mistake, instead of Lisbon, was 
made exactly as is directed in the Edinburgh 
Dispensatory; and I have since found half an 
ounce of it vomit a patient very well.
