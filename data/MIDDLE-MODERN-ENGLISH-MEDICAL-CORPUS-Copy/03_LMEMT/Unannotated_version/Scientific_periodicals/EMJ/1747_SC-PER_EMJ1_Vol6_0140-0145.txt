[}LXV. Of the Cure of the Cholera; by Dr. 
Charles Ayton-Douglas Physician in 
Fife. }]
THE Cholera, which is a violent vomiting 
and purging of Bile and other acrid Hu- 
mors, being a Disease so acute and deadly, as 
frequently to destroy a Man in the Space of 
twenty four Hours, when a Physician is not to 
be had, which is frequently the Case in the 
Country; or when a wrong Method of Cure is 
prescribed, which I am humbly of Opinion Et- 
mullerus's is, who recommends Vomits, Purges, 
and Sudorificks, which seems to be adding Oil 
to the Flame: I hope therefore my Country- 
men will take in good Part my publishing a Me- 
thod of curing it by a Medicine which is always 
at hand, even in the Houses of the meanest Pea- 
|P_141
sants; which I have tried often, and never found 
it fail. 

If the Patients be not too much exhausted be- 
fore I am called, I make them drink heartily 
of warm Water three or four Times, which 
they always throw up. This dilutes, and so 
blunts the Acrimony of the Humors, and at the 
same Time evacuates them. Immediately after 
I advise them to drink plentifully of a Decocti- 
on of Oat-bread baked without any Leven or 
Yest, carefully toasted as brown as Coffee, but 
not burnt; which Decoction ought to be of the 
Colour of Coffee, when it is weak. This Pre- 
scription I have always found my Patients most 
willingly obey, their Thirst being generally ve- 
ry great, and they always affirm that it is most 
grateful to their Stomachs; and I must add, 
that I do not remember that any of them ever 
vomited it. I have always used Oat-bread; but 
when it cannot be had, I doubt not but Wheat- 
bread, or Meal well toasted may do. 

But when the Patient is much exhausted with 
violent Evacuations upwards and downwards, the 
first thing that I give him, is a large Draught 
of the above mentioned Decoction; and when 
the Nausea is pretty well settled, I frequently 
order a Pill of Opium, to the Quantity of two 
thirds of a Grain for an ordinary Person, in- 
creasing or diminishing the Dose, according to 
the Age or Strength of the Patient. 

But if the Patient be convulsed, and the ex- 
treme Parts cold, and his Pulse weak and inter- 
mitting, then it is proper to give a strong Dose 
of liquid Laudanum, because it has its Effect 
sooner than the Opium, such as gut. xxv. for 
|P_142
an ordinary Person, in an Ounce of strong Cin- 
namon Water, and afterwards a Draught of any 
Wine that is most agreeable to the Patient, 
mixed with an equal Quantity of the Decocti- 
on; and they may afterwards take the Decocti- 
on to quench their Thirst; and now and then 
they may take a little Wine mixed with it, ac- 
cording as they need a Cordial. To prevent a 
Relapse, which the Patient is not able to bear, 
it will be proper to repeat the Opiate in a mo- 
derate Quantity for some Days, Morning and 
Evening. And Care must be taken not to o- 
verload the Stomach, or to eat any thing but 
what is of good Nourishment, and easy to di- 
gest, and grateful to the Stomach. 

It may be observed, that the above Prescripti- 
on is to be used when the Patient is quite ex- 
hausted, and in the very Jaws of Death; but 
in ordinary Cases, when the Patient is not much 
exhausted, and Opiates are not to be had, or 
if the Patient's Constitution disagrees with them, 
then the Decoction itself may be trusted to. 

What engaged me to prescribe the above 
Method of Cure to others, was my having tried 
it on myself with Success. A great many Years 
ago I was extremely ill of a Cholera, and the 
Evacuation upwards and downwards was so vio- 
lent, that in the Space of six Hours I was not 
able to stand unsupported; and I vomited Lau- 
danum and every other thing that could be 
thought on: But I longed much for a Draught 
of the Decoction above mentioned, and I ima- 
gined that I would not vomit it, although at 
the same time I loathed violently every other 
thing that any of my Friends that were about 
|P_143
me mentioned to me. As soon as a large Quan- 
tity of the Decoction could be got ready, I drank 
heartily of it, and it stopped both the vomiting 
and purging. Two or three Days after that, by 
being careless about my Diet, and the other 
Non-naturals, I relapsed, and was immediately 
again cured by the Decoction of toasted Bread; 
since which I have cured great Numbers with 
it. 

A Lady of my Acquaintance told me within 
this Fortnight, that about eight Days before she 
had a severe Cholera, in which she vomited eve- 
ry thing that was prescribed for her; but long- 
ing as earnestly as Women with Child use to 
long for any thing, for the Decoction of toast- 
ed Oat-bread, she drank several Draughts of 
it with great Pleasure, and was cured immedi- 
ately. 

A Physician of my Acquaintance, to whom I 
communicated this Method of Cure, assures me, 
that the Decoction itself, without any other 
thing, cured a Patient of his who was brought 
very low by a Cholera, occasioned by a Saliva- 
tion, after he had in vain tried every other 
thing that he could think on. 

This Medicine is not indeed a pompous Com- 
position, and has not in it Emeralds, Pearls, 
nor oriental Bezoar, recommended by Doleus and 
several other famous Practitioners. But it is not 
far different from Celsus's Method of Cure: For 
he [/1./] prescribes in the Beginning vomiting with 
warm Water, to be repeated frequently; and 
he says they should smell Pennyroyal dipped in 
Vinegar, or Polenta sprinkled with Wine; and 
|P_144
a little after that he advises the Patient to take 
Wine and Water mixed with Polenta. And 
Paulus Ægineta[/2./] prescribes vomiting with warm 
Water, and after that an Opiate. 

Polenta is mentioned by several of the anci- 
ent Greeks and Romans, as a thing generally u- 
sed in their Time. Pliny[/3./] says, that it differeth 
from Barley-meal, in so far as it is much toast- 
ed or parched; and to that he thinks it owes its 
astringent Quality, being good for the Stomach, 
and that it stops a Diarrhæa: And seeing it dif- 
fered from Barley-meal, only in so far at it was 
fryed or very much toasted, it could be made 
of nothing but Barley fryed or toasted brown, 
and grinded to Powder. And elsewhere [/4./] he 
describes it to have been made after this Man- 
ner by both the Greeks and Italians; but he adds, 
that they frequently mixed with it a little Lint- 
seed, some Salt, and some Coriander-seed. It 
is also mentioned by Hippocrates[/5./]. And it is de- 
scribed by Paulus Ægineta, as made of Barley 
fryed or much toasted; and he recommends it 
to be drank mixed with Water for quenching 
Thirst [/6./]. And it appears from the holy Scri- 
ptures to have been used by the Jews, as ancient- 
ly as the Reign of King David[/7./]. From whom, 
or the Syrians, it is probable that the Greeks
borrowed it; for by their own Confession they 
were much obliged to the Syrians and other 
Eastern Nations for many of their Customs, as 
|P_145
well as for some of the politer and more useful 
Arts and Sciences: And seeing it was usually 
drank mixed with Water, especially with bad 
Water, to make it wholsome and well tasted [/8./]; 
it is probable that the Arabians, who were Neigh- 
bours to the Syrians, and inhabited a dry and 
barren Country, where little Corn was produced, 
and Coffee-berries grew plentifully with little or 
no Culture, found it most convenient to make 
their Polenta of the Berries, or they might use 
a Decoction of them toasted, instead of the Po- 
lenta which their Neighbours the Syrians mixed 
with their Water.
