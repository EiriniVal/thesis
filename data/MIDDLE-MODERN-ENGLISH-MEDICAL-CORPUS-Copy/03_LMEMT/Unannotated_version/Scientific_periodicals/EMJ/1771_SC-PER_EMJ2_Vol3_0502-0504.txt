[}Account of an Amputation of the Arm, with- 
out Haemorrhage, by Dr Mudie Phy- 
sician at Montrose, in a letter to Dr Mon- 
ro senior [/1./]. }]
SIR, 

WITH this, I send you the account 
of an amputation of the arm, 
without any haemorrhage ensuing, and 
beg that, if you think it worthy a place 
in the Physical and Literary Essays, you 
will present it to the society to be insert- 
ed, if approved of. 

A healthy vigorous woman, 30 years 
of age, throwing in lint to the rollers of 
a lint-mill, unluckily had her left hand 
|P_503
catched by them, and that, with the fore- 
arm, arm, and top of the shoulder, drawn 
into these mashing machines. By this 
misfortune, the fingers and hand were 
severely crushed, and several of the bones 
of both broken; the teguments at the 
wrist tore away; the radial artery divided 
at the place the pulse is felt; the fore arm 
and arm very much contused, particular- 
ly at their articulation; and the os hume- 
ri broken within 2½ inches of its upper 
end. I advised the amputation of the 
limb; which was done, immediately a- 
bove the fracture of the os humeri, about 
four hours after the accident happened. 
The teguments, muscles, and bone being 
cut through, and the tournequet slacken- 
ed, no blood was squirted from the bra- 
chial artery, nor could any pulsation be 
observed at its extremity, though the 
smaller vessels discharged their contents 
as usual on the like occasion. The poor 
woman declared she was not faintish, 
(for she had lost no large quantity of 
blood), yet she got the best cordial her 
cottage could afford, a draught of warm 
|P_504
small beer, with a little geneva among 
it; and a sponge dipt in warm water 
was frequently applied to the stump for 
half an hour, when no haemorrhage ap- 
pearing, the dressings, as common, 
were applied, without a ligature being 
made on any artery, or so much as any 
styptic applied. The wound digested 
well, and was quite cicatrized some 
weeks ago, which was about 2½ months 
from the operation, without ever any 
flux of blood occurring. And the wo- 
man is again in good health. 

The histories by Mr Derante [/2./], Mr 
Belchier [/3./], and Mr Antrobus [/4./], are un- 
common and surprizing, as no profuse 
haemorrhage happened on the division 
of such large arteries; yet I imagine the 
above mentioned instance is fully as ex- 
traordinary, and less explicable. 

I am, &c.
