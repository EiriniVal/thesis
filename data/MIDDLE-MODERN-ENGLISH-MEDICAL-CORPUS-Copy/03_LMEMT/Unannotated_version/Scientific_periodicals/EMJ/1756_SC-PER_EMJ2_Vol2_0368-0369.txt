[}A History of a genuine Volvulus of the In- 
testines; by Alexander Monro junior, 
M. D. and Professor of Anatomy [/1./]. }]
AN old man complained of a colic, which 
was neglected more than two days; 
when Mr. William Wood Surgeon in Edin- 
burgh being called, found him in the ago- 
nies of death. Next day I obtained leave to 
open his abdomen, in presence of several 
students of physic. We saw fourteen inches 
long of the intestinum ilium hanging in a sinus
down in the pelvis, all black and mortified, 
occasioned by a strangulation at the upper 
part of the two pieces of the ilium which 
formed the sinus. The firm stricture there 
was made by the appendix vermiformis, the 
body of which lay behind the constricted 
parts of the ilium, while the end of it pas- 
sing over and before them, had sunk back 
again into a plica of the mesentery, from 
which, with great difficulty, I could draw

it out, for it was there extended into a glo- 
bular shape of three fourths of an inch dia- 
meter, by a glairy liquor, and was lodged 
in a depression of the mesentery, the entry 
to which was smaller than the cavity where 
the globular end of the appendix had been 
lodged.
