FOurteen epileptic patients in the royal hospi- 
tal at Stockholm were treated with pills of 
the stramonium. Of these, eight were intirely 
cured, five had their symptoms mitigated, and one 
only received no relief. The greatest part of these 
patients, upon beginning the use of this remedy, 
were affected with confusion in their heads, dim- 
ness in their eyes, and thirst; but these symptoms 
gradually diminished. 

A woman, after child-bed, was seized with mad- 
ness, for which no cause could be assigned. Her 
menses continued regular, but she shewed evident 
marks of great sensibility of the nervous system. 
Two physicians who attended her, after trying o- 
ther remedies in vain, had recourse to the stra- 
monium. They began her with pills of half a grain 
thrice a-day, and gradually augmented the dose,

till she took six or eight grains in the day. The 
good effects of this remedy soon appeared. It was 
not long before she recovered her reason, which 
she enjoyed perfectly for many years after- 
wards. 

A woman, after being for nine years affected 
with an itchy eruption at the points of her fingers, 
had it cured by means of plasters. This cure 
was followed by fluor albus, attended with many 
troublesome symptoms, the principal of which 
were, oppression at her breast, a tendency to deli- 
rium, vomiting, and frequent pains in her belly. 
The ordinary medicines employed in such cases 
were tried in vain; and attempts were made to 
recall the eruption to her fingers, but to no pur- 
pose. But, by the use of stramonium pills, her 
symptoms were greatly abated, her appetite resto- 
red, and her general habit and strength much re- 
cruited.
