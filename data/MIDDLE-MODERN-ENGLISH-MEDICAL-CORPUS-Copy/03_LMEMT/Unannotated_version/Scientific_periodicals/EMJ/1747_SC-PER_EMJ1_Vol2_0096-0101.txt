[}VIII. The Experiment of cutting the Recurrent 
Nerves carried on farther than has hitherto 
been done. In a Letter from Dr. George 
Martin, Physician at St. Andrews, to Mr. 
Monro Professor of Anatomy at Edinburgh, 
by whom it was communicated. }]
THE Moderns have acquired a much exact- 
er Knowledge of the Structure of the hu- 
man Body than the Ancients could possibly 
come at. We have the Advantage of the time 
and Pains they laid out in making their Obser- 
vations: and beside, can boast of many Oppor- 
tunities they were entirely destitute of. Yet 
we cannot but admire these great Men, if we 
will form a Judgment of them from the Monu- 
ments of their Genius and Industry they left 
behind them, tho' some of these are lost, and 
many of them, tho' preserved in Books are 
sometimes too much slighted by the over negli- 
gent Possessors of these Treasures. 

2. The first Physicians had but a very faint 
Notion of the Brain presiding over the Animal 
System by the Mediation of the spinal Marrow 
and Nerves produced from it, and distributed 
to the rest of the Body. And we must acknow- 
ledge this was not sufficiently understood be- 
fore Herophilus and Erasistratus, the greatest 
Anatomists of Antiquity, who explained this 
Scheme, and left the World no Room to doubt 
of this elegant Piece of Mechanism of the ani- 
mal Body. Physicians began to dissect with 
|P_[^Illustrations.^]
|P_97
more than ordinary Care both living and dead 
Animals; and they soon found, that by cut- 
ting, tying or compressing any Nerve, or any 
other Way intercepting its Communication 
with the Brain, the Parts to which it belonged 
were immediately deprived of all Sense and 
Motion. 

3. It was easy to confirm this Doctrine by 
Experiments on any of the ordinary Nerves. 
But one of the prettiest Instances of it, was the 
making Ligatures upon the Vessels at the Side 
of the Wind-pipe, and immediately striking 
the Animal dumb, however noisy it was before. 
The first Makers of this Experiment thought 
the Animal turned comatous, or fell asleep; 
and ascribing this Effect to the intercepting any 
Passage of vital Blood from the Heart to the 
Brain, by the Way of the Arteries; they gave 
these blood Vessels the Name of Carotids, 
χαροτιδώυ. But in the Days of Ruffus [/1./], 
this sudden Silence of the Animal was found to 
proceed from the tying of the adjacent Nerves. 
And Galen, who seems to have laboured this 
Affair more than any of his Predecessors, evi- 
dently proved [/2./], That tying the Arteries solely 
produced little Change on the Animal. In this 
Case, (laying aside the captious Cavils and Op- 
positions of Hoffman, Vanderlinden, Wepfer, 
and others of the Moderns, who disputed a- 
gainst the Experiments, which however easy, 
they would not take the Trouble to repeat) we 
must conceive the Brain to have been furnished 
|P_98
by the vertebral Arteries. And so he found 
all that the Animal suffered in the Experiment 
of tying the whole Vessels at the Side of the 
Trachea, to be a sudden Obmutescence; which 
entirely proceded from the intercepting the 
nervous Influence on the Muscles of the Larynx: 
For he discovered [/3./] that these Nerves were 
derived from the Par vagum; and that they, 
making a Turn under the right subclavian Ar- 
tery, and descending Aorta, climbed up along 
each Side of the Wind-pipe, to furnish these 
Muscles. 

4. The Oddness and Novelty of all this Do- 
ctrine, was in those Days surprising [/4./]. The 
Virtuosi at Rome knew nothing of it; yea A- 
lexander of Damascus, the Peripatetick and 
Preceptor of Boethius, was resolved to deny 
and oppose it at any rate. He would rather 
resist the Evidence of Sense, than yield any 
thing that might contribute to the rising Glory 
of Galen his Rival. But our Anatomist, in the 
midst of a learned and judicious Assembly, con- 
sisting of Adversaries as well as Friends, by o- 
cular Demonstration, gave them at once a con- 
vincing Proof of the Truth of his Doctrine, and 
of his own extraordinary Skill in Dissections. 
Yea this was confirmed by some casual Observati- 
ons made on some of our own Species [/5./]. An 
unlucky scrophulous Boy falling into the Hands 
of an ignorant Surgeon, lost the half of the 
Strength of his Voice, by having one of the 
Recurrent Nerves cut along with the Tumour. 
|P_99
However he escaped better than another Boy, 
who in the like Case was indeed cured of the 
Strumæ; but, having both the Recurrents ex- 
tirpated, was left quite dumb. 

5. This Experiment of cutting these Nerves 
in brute Animals, was repeated and confirmed 
by Vesalius [/6./], otherwise, you know, no 
great Favourer of the Doctrines or Glory of 
Galen. And I myself about twelve or thirteen 
Years ago, when I was first setting out to make 
such Experiments, trying it in a Pig, with all 
the Circumspection I was then capable of, found 
it to answer exactly. So that tho' this elegant 
Operation has been much out of Use among 
the Moderns, insomuch that one might have 
suspected it had been given over for want of 
Success, yet, however great Regard I have 
to your Judgment and great Skill in Anatomy, 
I could not consent to you, when, from a pre- 
conceived Theory you seem to think [/7./]it 
probable the Voice would not be entirely lost, 
tho' both the recurrent Nerves were cut, so 
long as the superior Branches still supply the Lar- 
ynx. It is true that Galen [/8./] himself taught that 
there was on each Side an Inosculation of the 
Extremity of the Recurrent, with one of the su- 
perior Branches of the eighth Nerve. This was 
copied by Nic. Massa, painted by Eustachio, and 
confirmed by Willis and the Moderns: But still, 
on Dissection, I could not find that there was a- 
ny regular Distribution of Nerves to the proper 
Muscles of the Larynx, from any other Origin 
|P_100
beside the Recurrent. This you know I 
guessed to be the Case: And now I find it to 
be true in Fact. 

6. It is plain then, That the Voice must be 
lost, however sound and free we suppose the 
superior Branches of the Par vagum. But still 
there is some hankering Doubt in this Affair; 
and it is proposed to try this over again, and 
keep the Animal alive some Weeks, to see if 
the Voice would at all return. We know not 
of any of the Ancients carrying on the Experi- 
ment thus far; except we say Galen's scrophu- 
lous Boys show the absolute Irrecoverableness 
of the Voice. But to put the Matter beyond 
all Doubt, I repeated the Experiment this Spring 
on a young Sow five or six Weeks old, some 
Days before it was weaned from sucking, and 
took greater Notice of all the Circumstances 
than I had done formerly. I could observe with 
the Ancients, and so did two curious young 
Gentlemen who assisted me, that upon cutting 
the Nerve on one Side, the Voice was not de- 
stroyed, only it became weaker; but upon cut- 
ting the other, it was entirely lost, tho', by the 
Sound of the Breath, and the Motion of the 
Thorax, you would manifestly have seen a 
fruitless Conatus, and the Creature straining to 
make a Noise. And so I very well understood 
Vesalius, when he says, Pulchrè auditur quàm 
validam efflationem animal citra vocem molia- 
tur, recurrentibus nervis cultello divisis . The 
Creature, when dismissed, seemed well enough, 
sucked the Mother for some Days, lived with 
the rest of the Litter seemingly hearty and well, 
tho' always dumb. It could indeed make some 
|P_101
little, just audible, grunting Noise, but could 
never give a Squeak in the ordinary Manner 
of these Animals. From the Beginning it 
breathed as if the Glottis were too wide, espe- 
cially in the Heat of the Day. And this Diffi- 
culty in some Weeks began to increase upon 
it; so that in Process of Time it became more 
lazy and solitary, frequently retired to the Shade 
by it self; by Degrees lost its Strength and Ap- 
petite, pined away, and at length in about six 
or seven Weeks died. Upon inspecting the 
Larynx, I could not say it had undergone any 
great or remarkable Change. The Orifices of 
the Ventricles seemed, I thought, laxer, and 
a little above them the Membrane of the Glottis
was somewhat inflamed on each Side. 

7. The Ancients knew, That the Noise of 
the Voice depended on a due Narrowness of 
the Aperture of the Glottis. And the Author 
of the Book de voce & anhelitu [/9./], ascribed to 
Galen, expresly affirms, tunc vox destrueretur: So 
that on the cutting the Recurrent Nerves, we 
are to conceive the Glottis to stand open, and 
not to be shut at the Pleasure of the Animal. And 
what else indeed can we expect, when the ner- 
vous Influence on the Muscles belonging to the 
Arytænoid Cartilages is taken away in such a 
Manner that they can never be brought to a due 
Constriction, nor the Ventricles of the Larynx
suffer any Variety of Contraction and Dilata- 
tion.
