[}A Child brought forth at a Rent of the Belly [/1./]. }]
IN April 1736, Elspet Grant, in the parish 
of Moy, being with child, took her la- 
bour-pains. After they had continued three 
days with the child in the birth, two cracks, 
as if the rafters of the house had broke, 
were heard about the sick wife, and her bel- 
ly was rent from near the navel, with a 
squaint downwards and to the left side, to 
near the share-bone. At this rent the child 
came into the world, the after-burthen was 
brought away, and the intrails were seen. 

The rent was cured without any other ap- 
plication, than that of butter mixed with 
white sugar, and its scar was only as the 
scratch of a big pin. 

These facts are attested by the judicial 
oaths of Anna Kennedy a midwife, and Mary 
Ogilvie a neighbour, who were present when 
the rent was made and the child came out 
of it; of Margaret Dallas, who assisted to 
|P_339
bring away the after-burthen; of Robert 
Smith who saw the rent and intrails imme- 
diately after this; and of Isobel Tarrel, who, 
afterwards examined the scar: taken and 
subscribed by James Macqueen younger of 
Corribrough, Bailie to the Laird of Mackintosh, 
at Moyhall, November 22. 1738; of which 
the original subscribed copies are kept by the 
Secretaries of the Philosophical Society of 
Edinburgh. 

[}A Child escaping at a Rent of the Womb in- 
to the Abdomen; by Alexander Monro, 
senior, M. D. & P. A. }]
IN March 1744, I was desired by Mr. 
Ramsay Surgeon here, to witness the exa- 
mination of the body of a woman who died 
in child-labour without being delivered. The 
account given me of this woman was, that 
she was about 35 years of age, and had born 
two dead children, and a living one. Being at 
her full reckoning, her pains had begun on 
Tuesday morning, and continued in a natural 
way, the child advancing towards the birth, 
|P_340
and some of the waters coming away all that 
day and Wednesday, till Wednesday evening, 
when sitting in a chair in labour, she gave 
a sudden spring from the chair, complaining 
of violent pain in her belly. The child ne- 
ver was felt afterwards by those who attempt- 
ed to assist her delivery. She constantly 
complained of violent pain in her belly, with 
her senses and judgment intire, till Friday
morning, when she died. On Saturday her 
body was opened. 

After cleaning away with spunges a con- 
siderable quantity of blood floating in the 
abdomen, we saw a ripe child and its secun- 
dines lying in the lower part of it, a little to 
the right side. The child, placenta, and um- 
bilical rope were intire, and the membranes 
were as usual after birth. The woman's ute- 
rus had its fundus raised as high as the navel, 
with its substance soft and spongy as is com- 
mon in pregnants, nothing preternatural 
appearing in its fore-side; but when the 
fundus was turned down and forwards to- 
wards the ossa pubis, a large rent four inches 
long was seen towards the neck of the womb; 
which being again put into its natural situa- 
tion, was opened its whole length, in the 
|P_341
middle of its forepart, when we had a bet- 
ter view of the rent, extending from very 
near the os uteri upwards, a little obliquely 
to the right side. The os uteri was then ve- 
ry little open. The cervix which is distin- 
guishable plainly from the fundus in a woman 
not with child, was here extended into the 
same common sac with it. The inner surface 
of the womb was all smooth, seeming to be 
covered with a fine villous membrane. From 
the larger size of the sinuses at the back and 
upper part of the womb, I judged the pla- 
centa to have been formerly applied there.
