[}A Description of the seminal Vessels, by Ale- 
xander Monro, Student of Medicine in 
the University of Edinburgh. }]
THO' all anatomists agree, that the seed 
separated in the testicle, passes thro' 
the epidydimis to rise in the vas defe- 
rens; yet few have a right notion of even the 
grosser tubes in which it is conveyed. I have 
luckily made quicksilver pass sarther in these 
seminal vessels, and thereby brought more of 
them into view, than I see described in any 
anatomical book; as you may judge by the 
preparations and pictures which I now send 
you, at my father's desire. 

De Graaf had formerly endeavoured, by 
dissection, to unravel the epidydimis; and 
paints it [/1./], as rising from the testicle in six or 
seven branches, which join at its caput or 
first remarkable turn into one pipe, the nu- 
merous contortions of which form the body 
|P_397
of the epidydimis, terminating at its other end 
in the vas deferens. 

This seems to have been overlooked, or 
not well understood, by most of the modern 
anatomists, who have differed widely, or 
talked with uncertainty, about these pipes; 
till of late, that the ingenious Dr. Haller, by 
injecting quicksilver from the vas deferens, in 
the manner proposed by my father in the 
Medical Essays[/2./], and causing it to pass as sar 
as the testicle, has been able to explain to us, 
with greater accuracy, the structure of this 
intricate organ [/3./]. He agrees with De Graaf, 
that the epidydimis, from the vas deferens to 
its head, seems to be composed of a single 
pipe, which he thinks might possibly be un- 
loosened, as De Graaf has represented; but 
does not affirm his having executed it. At 
its head indeed, he could divide it into ten or 
more vascular cones, from which vessels go 
out, that, after forming a network with com- 
munications, give off streight pipes which 
seem to plunge into the body of the testicle. 
—His injection here generally failed, tho' he 
sometimes observed, that it entered a few con- 
|P_398
voluted tubes.—He mentions his having thrice 
seen a vessel going off from about the middle 
of the epidydimis towards the spermatic cord, 
which he imagines is a lymphatic. 

That this accurate anatomist's improve- 
ments, and the additions I am to make to 
them, may be better understood; I have first 
copied his elegant figure, and then subjoined 
some others I caused to be drawn of those 
parts.

A. The vas deferens. 
B. The end or last turn of the epidydimis. 
C. Its body, as it appears when the exter- 
nal membrane is dissected off. 
D. Its head unloosened. 
eee. &c. The vascular cones into which it 
divides. 
ff. The vasa efferentia, as he calls them. 
gg. The network with communications. 
hh. The streight vessels which seem to 
plunge into the testicle.

Infig. 2. The tunica vaginalis of the te- 
sticle is cut off, and the testicle, injected e- 
pidydimis and spermatic cord, are represent-

|P_399
A. The serpentine beginning of the vas 
deferens. 
B. The globus minor, or last turn of the 
epidydimis, from which the small convo- 
luted vessel, c, which Dr. Haller sup- 
poses to be a lymphatic, rises.—If it 
is so, it has not the valvular structure 
common to those vessels; for I can cause 
the quick-silver to flow either way in it. 
D. The corpus pyramidale. 
E. The body of the epidydimis, where the 
convolutions seen thro' the membranes, 
are larger than they appear in fig. 1. 
F. The head, globus major, or first remark- 
able turn of the epidydimis. 
G. Its rise from the testicle. 
[^An illustration of the testicle, epididymis, and spermatic cord, on a separate page. ^]
Infig. 3. and 4. The tunica albuginea is 
taken off from the sides of the testicle, and 
turned over upon the epidydimis. 
A. The tunica albuginea. 
B. The testicle. 
hh. Dr. Haller's streight pipes from which 
ccc. The small convoluted tubes upon the 
sides of the testicle are continued. 
dd. In fig. 4. Represents a number of them 
upon the convex part of the testicle, at

der in its middle from its convex surface to-

Fig. 6. A small piece is in the same man- 
ner separated from the side of it. 

In both we observe Dr. Haller's streight 
vessels entering at hh; and then dividing into 
ccc inumerable convoluted pipes, which com- 
pose almost the whole substance of the testi- 
cle. 

dd. A number of them where the injecti- 
on has gone very far. 
[^Two illustrations of the testicle on a separate page. ^]
N. These preparations had been kept se- 
veral months in spirits, and so often handled 
before the drawings were made, that many 
of the injected vessels are destroyed, and the 
painter could not distinguish the membranous 
partitions of the testicle. 

As many of the most accurate anatomists,
and even Winslow[/4./], have imagined, that the 
body of the epidydimis is composed of a num- 
ber of pipes.—As Dr. Haller does not po- 
sitively affirm his having unloosened it.— 
As the vas deferens is much larger than any 
|P_401
pipe in the epidydimis, and as it seems diffi- 
cult to conceive how the seed can be propel- 
ed thro' a tube so small, so much convoluted, 
and of such a length as the single one, which, 
according to De Graaf, forms the epidydimis: 
on these accounts, I think, there is reason to 
doubt this structure which he asserts, till we 
have more satisfying proof of it than has hi- 
therto been adduced.—Such the following 
appears to be. If, in attempting to make 
preparations like to those above described, an 
extravasation happens in any part of the epi- 
dydimis, or if any of its convolutions are tied, 
not a drop of the injection can be pushed 
farther towards the testicle than this extrava- 
sation or ligature: and, if the epidydimis is 
cut across, while quicksilver is poured into 
the tube fixed in the vas deferens, it squirts 
out only at one orifice in this cut part; which 
is the plainest and most convincing demon- 
stration of the body of the epidydimis, being 
intirely composed of a single tube convoluted 
in a most wonderful manner. 

Tho' my injection penetrated far into the 
seminal pipes; yet still we are unacquainted 
with their origin. De Graaf[/5./] attempted in 
|P_402
vain to discover this by maceration in water;
nor have anatomists since his time been more 
successful. 

I have endeavoured several times to force 
quick-silver from the spermatic arteries into 
the seminal vessels; but, tho' I made it re- 
turn by the spermatic veins, I could never 
cause it to pass into these convoluted tubes. 

This I attempted the oftener, because of 
the seeming probability of our being able to 
determine, better in this than in other glands, 
whether secretion is performed in continued 
cylindrical canals, according to Ruysch, or, 
by the intervention of follicles, with Mal- 
pighius; since we can separate the parts of 
the testicle, without cutting, and even al- 
most without laceration.
