[}History of a singular Case, of an intermittent 
affecting the right Temple; and of a re- 
markable Tumour in the Abdomen, successfully 
treated. By Mr Samuel Davidson, Surgeon 
at Rothbury, in Northumberland. }]
WILLIAM B—, labourer, aged 
forty-one, applied to me for advice, 
on the 9th of January 1789. Fourteen days 
before, he received a stroke on the right eye 
with a piece of wood, of which he soon re- 
covered. About a week ago, he was seized 
with a shivering paroxysm, which continued 
for two hours, and was succeeded by a severe 
pain in the right eye and temple, which goes 
off by a sweat in the space of two hours. The 
cold fit, and pain, attack periodically, about 
nine o'clock, and the paroxysm continues till 
twelve o'clock. When the pain comes on, he 
is deprived of the sight of that eye; and for 
|P_392
the remainder of the twenty-four hours, he is 
free from every complaint. His eye is much 
inflamed ; and he is costive. 

I ordered an emetic to be taken before the 
attack of the next paroxysm; which however 
did not mitigate it.

[}Case II. }]
Mrs D—, aged twenty-six, a widow-lady, 
the mother of two children, was affected with a 
swelling under the left ear, which began first 
to appear about the month of May 1788, and 
|P_396
gradually increased in size till the month of 
November 1789. It had every appearance of 
a scrophulous tumour, and was about the bulk 
of a goose egg; but did not come to suppura- 
tion. Notwithstanding the increase of this 
tumour, she enjoyed pretty good health and 
spirits. 

I was called to her on the 16th of November 
1789; when I found her complaining of great 
pain in the right side of the abdomen, attend- 
ed with nausea, vomiting, and thirst. Her 
pulse was small, and beat one hundred and 
thirty strokes in a minute. She was also co- 
stive, and had been so for two days. 

On farther inquiry, she informed me of a 
tumour she had felt for four months past, situ- 
ated about an equal distance between the um- 
bilicus and the spine of the os innominatum 
on the right side. This tumour, which was 
at first very small, continued increasing till the 
time I was sent for, without much pain or un- 
easiness, except at times; but which were never 
very severe, and always of very short duration. 

On examining the tumour, it felt deep- 
seated, hard, moveable, and of size sufficient to 
fill the whole length of the hand, with a gra- 
|P_397
dual decrease of its bulk, towards the os inno- 
minatum and umbilicus. The pain in the tu- 
mour, during this attack, was so excruciating 
and exquisite, that she could not suffer the 
weight of the bed-clothes on the part. Her 
catamenia had been always regular; except 
that, for a few months past, they had ap- 
peared in somewhat less quantity. 

Ten ounces of blood were taken from her 
directly; but the blood had no buffy coat. I 
next ordered her repeated doses of aloetic pills, 
with opium and laxative glysters, to remove 
the costiveness; and also a saline julep, to a- 
bate the vomiting. Leeches were applied to 
the tumour; and afterwards it was rubbed with 
a liniment of camphor and vitriolic æther. In 
the course of four days, the nausea and vomit- 
ing, and the pain, gradually diminished, by 
observing a strict adherence to these medi- 
cines; but there was no decrease of size in 
the tumour. 

After the symptoms were abated, I ordered 
her gentle exercise, the cold bath, and put 
her under a course of cicuta, conjoined with 
the Peruvian bark. By persisting in the use 
of these medicines for three months, the tu- 
|P_398
mour gradually decreased; and, at the time 
of writing this account of her cafe, she enjoys 
good health and spirits, without any return of 
the tumour. It is proper to observe, that the 
tumour under her ear always remained, and is 
still the same, without coming to suppura- 
tion.
