[}LXVIII. The Ureters obstructed by small Stones; 
by Alexander Monro, P. A. }]
AN old Man who had suffered under some 
severe Fits of the Stone, several small ones 
of which he had passed, and who afterwards had 
had violent HÃ¦morrhagies at his Nose, recove- 
red, in appearance, a very firm State of Health, 
without any Complaint, and enjoyed it a con- 
siderable Time. Being attacked with another 
Fit of the Gravel, and nothing being evacuated 
from the Bladder, except now and then a Spoon- 
ful of a clear limpid Liquor, which had neither 
Smell nor Taste of Urine more than Serum of 
the Blood has, and no Distension of the Bladder 
coming on, was blooded, purged, bathed, and 
all the other Methods practised in Obstructions 
of Urine and Stone, were employed in vain, 
the Obstruction remained, he became comatous, 
and died. 

The left Kidney was considerably less than 
natural, and was become a thin Sac; the Ure- 
ter belonging to it was very small, and felt 
hard. When cut open, it was found fully stuf- 
fed with Gravel of a dirty black Colour, squee- 
|P_156
zed so close together, that no Liquor had pro- 
bably past that Way for a considerable Time. 

The right Kidney was distended with Urine 
to a most monstrous Size, and the Ureter was 
so large, that at fist Sight I mistook it for a 
Piece of Intestine. Upon opening it down to the 
Bladder, I found a small Stone, niched so firm- 
ly between the Coats of the Bladder, that I had 
some Difficulty to bring it out; it was not a- 
bove a fourth of an Inch from the Orifice of 
the Ureter into the Bladder. Two of your 
Number were Witnesses to what I have now re- 
lated.
