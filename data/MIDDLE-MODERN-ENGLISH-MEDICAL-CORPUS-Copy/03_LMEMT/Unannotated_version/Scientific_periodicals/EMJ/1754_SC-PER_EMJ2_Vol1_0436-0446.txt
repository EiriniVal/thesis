[}Of the Difference between Respiration and the 
Motion of the Heart, in sleeping and wa- 
king Persons, by Robert Whytt, M. D.
&c. }]
OF all the parts of the human body, there 
is none whose structure is more sub- 
tile, and whose several functions and uses are 
less known, than those of the brain. It is 
little to be wondered at, therefore, if au- 
thors have failed of giving a satisfactory ac- 
count of sleep, which is one particular state 
of this unknown organ.—We have elsewhere 
offered our conjectures concerning the reason 
why the vital motions continue in time of 
sleep; when the organs of sense become less 
fit to receive the impressions of external ob- 
jects; and when the muscles of voluntary 
motion are more relaxed and remain at rest [/1./]. 
But, as respiration and the motion of the 
|P_437
heart, suffer some change in time of sleep, 
i. e. become then slower, fuller and more e- 
quable, than when we are awake [/2./], it may 
be worth while to enquire a little into the 
reason of this phaenomenon. 

It has been shewn, that as the dilatation 
of the ventricles of the heart, is owing to 
the force of the refluent venous blood; so 
their contraction is produced, by the same 
blood acting upon them as a stimulus[/3./]: and 
that the heart can only be affected by stimuli, 
in so far as it is a sentient organ, i. e. en- 
dued with feeling [/4./]. Whence it must follow, 
that the slowness of the pulse in sleep, and 
indeed in every other case, can only arise 
from one or more of the following general 
causes, viz. 1. A diminution of the stimu- 
lating quality of the blood. 2. Its slower re- 
turn to the heart; or, 3. A less degree of 
sensibility or aptitude for motion in the heart 
itself. 

|P_438
I. When one has eat or drunk a great deal 
before sleep, his pulse will be, not slow, but 
quick and full; because the stimulating power 
of the blood is increased, by a large quantity 
of chyle received into it. Much the same 
thing may happen from sleeping in too hot 
an air, or under too great a weight of cloaths: 
for we know, that heat quickens the circu- 
lation of the fluids in all animals. On 
the other hand, when one has fasted long 
before sleep, and lies very cool, his pulse 
will, in time of it, be unusually slow. 

But when the blood is neither loaded 
with new chyle, nor altogether destitute of 
it; neither too much heated by cloaths or 
the external air, nor too cool, thro' want of 
proper covering; its stimulating quality will 
neither be augmented nor diminished by 
sleep; but will continue the same as in a per- 
son who is awake in the same circumstances. 
It remains therefore, that the slowness of the 
heart's motion in time of sleep, be owing, 
either to the slower return of the venous 
blood to it, or to some diminution of its sen- 
sibility. 

II. Every one knows, that the affections 
of the mind disturb the motion of the heart; 
|P_439
that the pulse is quicker when we sit or stand 
than when we lye; and that the action of 
the muscles of voluntary motion, not only 
promotes the return of the blood to the 
heart, but determines it thither, with much 
greater force than usual. In sleep therefore, 
where the horizontal posture of the body, 
the quiescence of the voluntary muscles, and 
composure of the mind, all concur to render 
the return of the venous blood to the heart, 
more equable and slow, the contraction of 
this muscle must be renewed at greater inter- 
vals, and with more regularity, than when 
we are awake, and the circulation is quicken- 
ed or disturbed by some, or all, of the above- 
mentioned causes. But, if no farther cir- 
cumstance, tending to retard the heart's mo- 
tion, were found in sleep, the pulse should 
be equally slow and full in a waking person 
lying at rest in a horizontal posture, and 
whose mind is composed, as in the same per- 
son in time of sleep; which, however, does 
not seem to be entirely the case: for tho' the 
difference may be small, and there may be 
many causes which may render it difficult, by 
observation, to determine that difserence with 
any degree of certainty; yet the remarkable 
|P_440
slowness and fulness of the pulse in the deep 
sleep, accompanying an apoplexy or occasioned 
by opium, makes it highly probable, that even 
in the much gentler sleep of persons in 
health, the pulse is somewhat slower and 
fuller, than it would be, merely from the 
composure of mind, horizontal position of 
the body, and quiescence of the muscles of 
voluntary motion. Let us therefore see, whe- 
ther the slowness and fulness of the heart's 
motion in time of sleep, may not be in part 
owing, to some diminution of the sensibility 
of this organ. 

3. In time of sleep, as the exercise of the 
several senses, is either suspended or much 
impaired; so the sensibility or feeling, with 
which the organs of the body are more or 
less endued, seems to be rendered less acute. 
Thus we feel ourselves affected with a kind 
of stupor, when we are just salling asleep, 
and are then insensible of lesser stimuli. The 
thin rheum, which, by irritating the wind- 
pipe, keeps us almost perpetually coughing 
when awake, gives us little or no disturbance 
in sleep; any extraordinary stimulus in the guts 
is also less perceived then; and hence it is, 
that a dose of any purgative taken at night, is 
|P_441
much longer before it operates, than when it 
is swallowed in the morning. If the heart 
therefore, like the other organs of the body, 
becomes less sensible or irritable in time of 
sleep, it will not be so quickly excited into 
contraction as usual, by the venous blood rush- 
ing into its cavities; and hence its contracti- 
ons will not only be more slowly repeated, 
but the pulse will be full, because the ventri- 
cles do not contract, till they are much dis- 
tended with blood. This will still further 
appear, if we consider how remarkably slow 
and full the pulse is, in an apoplexy, where 
the sensibility of all the parts and their apti- 
tude for motion, are much more impaired 
than in common sleep: and how opium, which 
occasions sleep, and lessens the sense of feel- 
ing every where thro' the body, when given 
in a large dose, renders the pulse uncom- 
monly slow and full. Thus the heart of a 
frog, into whose stomach and guts I had, an 
hour before, injected a solution of opium, 
was observed to beat near four times slower 
than usual; and the auricle and great veins 
leading to the heart, were remarkably dis- 
tended with blood, as was also the ventricle 
of the heart before every contraction. At 
|P_442
the same time the other muscles of this ani- 
mal were so intirely deprived of feeling as 
not to be, in any degree, affected by prick- 
ing or tearing their fibres [/5./]. 

Does not the slower digestion of the ali- 
ment in time of sleep, proceed, partly, from 
the peristaltic motion of the stomach and guts 
being then repeated after longer intervals? 
In dogs who have got a large dose of opium, this 
motion is very much lessened or totally suspend- 
ed, the food last received into the stomach re- 
mains there indigested, the guts are more 
than usualy empty, and the lacteal vessels in- 
visible [/6./]. In sleep, therefore, not only the 
heart but the stomach and guts also, become 
less sensible of the stimulus usually affecting 
them, and consequently repeat their contra- 
ctions more slowly. 

De Gorter, differing from Boerhaave and o- 
ther authors, thinks, that the pulse must be, 
not fuller, but softer in time of sleep, because 
the circulation of the blood is allowed, then, 
to proceed more slowly than when we are a- 
|P_443
wake [/7./]. But, from what has been said, it ap- 
pears, that the fulness of the pulse in sleep, is not 
owing to the quicker circulation of the blood, 
but to a less degree of sensibility in the heart, 
whereby its ventricles are not excited into 
contraction, till they have been more fully 
dilated, then usual, by the returning blood. 
It is, however, to be observed, that the ful- 
ness of the pulse in sleep, may be owing 
partly, to the fluids passing, with greater diffi- 
culty, thro' the very small lateral arteries, and 
the secretory tubes of the glands [/8./]. For we 
know that the fulness or softness of the pulse 
does not depend, solely, upon the quantity of 
blood thrown out by the left ventricle of the 
heart, but also upon the more or less difficult 
passage of this fluid thro' the extreme arteries; 
since, in proportion as these are obstructed 
or open, a greater or less resistance will be 
opposed to the blood projected by the heart. 

After what has been said of the slowness 
of the heart's motion in sleep, it will be easy 
to shew why respiration should be performed, 
then, at greater intervals. 

|P_444
The cause exciting the alternate contracti- 
on of the inspiratory muscles, is an uneasy 
sensation in the lungs, occasioned by the 
blood pushed into their vessels by the right 
ventricle of the heart [/9./]. If then less blood 
is sent, in a given time, into the lungs, in 
sleep, than when we are awake; the necessity 
of new supplies of fresh air will be lessened, 
and consequently inspiration will be perform- 
ed at greater intervals. 

Further, as in time of sleep, the sensi- 
bility of the lungs, like that of the heart 
and guts, must be somewhat impaired, re- 
spiration must also, on this account, be per- 
formed more slowly; for the inspiratory 
muscles will not be excited into action till a 
greater degree of irritation, than usual, be 
occasioned by the blood accumulated in the 
pulmonary vessels. And, to this it is owing, 
that respiration is not only slower but some- 
what deeper in time of sleep, than in a waking 
person at rest in a horrizontal position. 

In comatous and apoplectic cases, where 
all the feelings of the body are much more 
impaired than in ordinary sleep, respiration is 
not only much slower and deeper than usual, 
|P_445
but, sometimes, after expiration is finished, 
a pause of 15, 20, 30, or more seconds will 
intervene, before a new inspiration is begun. 
Much the same thing happens to animals 
who have swallowed too great a quantity of 
opium[/10./]. 

Now, if it be reasonable to ascribe the slow, 
deep and interrupted breathing, in such 
cases, to the insensibility which attends those 
diseases of the head; and which opium never 
fails to produce, when taken too liberally; 
are we not hence led to conclude, the less re- 
markable change of breathing which hap- 
pens in sleep, to be owing, partly, to the 
sense of feeling in the lungs, being then 
somewhat diminished, tho' in a much less 
degree than in those morbid cases? 

To conclude with summing up what has 
been said in a few words; in ordinary sleep 
the sensibility of the heart and lungs suffer 
so small a diminution, that their motions 
will be very little more affected by it, than 
they would be from the horrizontal position 
and rest of the body, and composure of mind 
attending it. In the deeper sleep, which 
succeeds great fatigue, the motions of the 
|P_446
heart and lungs will be more observably al- 
tered. And, in the most profound sleep, oc- 
casioned by opium or a morbid state of the 
brain, where a general insensibility reigns 
over the whole body; the pulse will become 
much more remarkably slow and full, and 
respiration slower and deeper.
