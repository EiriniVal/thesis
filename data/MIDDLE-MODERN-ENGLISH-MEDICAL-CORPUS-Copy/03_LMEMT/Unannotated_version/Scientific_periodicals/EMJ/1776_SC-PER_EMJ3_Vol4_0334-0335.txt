[}Fatty Substances voided by Stool. By Dr William 
Scott, Physician, Hawick. }]
A Servant girl, about four or five and twenty 
years of age, after working hard, in warm 
weather, cutting down corn, was seized with a 
pain in her stomach, loathing of food, obstruction 
of the menses, colics, and pains from flatulency. 
As the colics frequently seized her, injections, a- 
nodynes, and sacred elixir were administred. Af- 
ter that I gave vomits, and rhubarb boluses, with 
calomel. Upon taking two or three of these,

she began to void, by stool, fatty substances, in 
great numbers, about the size of nuts, beans, 
pease, &c. When these were thrown into the 
fire they burnt like tallow, which they, in every 
respect, resembled. After passing these in small 
quantities for three weeks, she got clear of all her 
complaints, and has now continued in very good 
health for these several years.
