[}Sorenes.}] 
 
GOD giue me grace, to beware of soche fellowes, as you haue 
spoken of before, whiche are an euill compainie, and that I 
might learne what a very Chyrurgian should bee, whiche in your 
conclusion, you haue commended, and what thynges he should doe in 
his office. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
HE must begin first in youth with good learning, & excercise 
[/1./] 
in this noble art, he also must be clenly, nimble handed, 
sharpe sighted, prignant witted, bolde spirited, clenly 
apparailed, pitefull harted, but not womenly affeccionated: 
to wepe or trimble, whe~ he seeth broken bones, 
or bloodie woundes, neither muste he geue place to the 
crie of his sore paciente, for softe Chyrurgians maketh fowle sores. Of the 
other side, he maie not plaie the partes of a Butcher to cutte, rende, or 
teare, the bodie of manne kynde. For all though it be fraile, sore, and 
weake, yet it is the pleasure of God, to cal it his temple, his instrume~t 
and dwelyng place, and the Philosopher dooe call it Orbiculus, that is alittle 
worlde. Therefore seing euery craftes man doe take greate care, 
bothe daie and night in his vocacion, to helpe and amende dedde 
thinges, whiche bee insencible, as Shippes, houses, walles, bridges, 
[/2./] 
and an infinite numbre of thinges, whiche mankynde dooeth make, 
and when it is old, doe renue it, and preserue it from ruyng, and vtter 
destruccion, although it be not perdurable: Should not therfore mankynde 
hymself, for his rewarde, bee diligently cured, amended, and renued, 
when either through falle, wounde, or stripe he is decaied, and 
that with wisedome and diligence, for when a house is fallen doune 
the Carpentar maie builde it vp again. But when mankinde departeth, 
[/3./] 
desolueth, and dieth he cannot be reuiued again, by the policie or 
cunnyng of mankinde, because one mankinde, can not make an other 
[/4./] 
but rather through arte, when thei be decaied, helpe to amende them, 
through the worke of nature, and the ministracion of the Phisicion: 
for Claudius Galen saieth, that Natura est operatrix, Medicus vero eius minister. That is, 
nature is the worker, the Phisicion is but her minister. Therefore the 
Chyrurgicall Phisicion, is natures seruaunt. 
 
[}Sorenes}] 
 
What then doe nature worke, in Chyrurgj? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
NAture woorketh three maner of waies, by the reason that conuenente 
[/5./] 
instrumentes and meanes, are applied in the tyme of 
nede, to helpe here. For firste she deuideth the thinges that are 
conteined, or vnnaturally knit together. Secondly, she vniteth, knitteth, 
[^f.8v^] 
and ioineth together, the seperated partes. Thirdly, she expulseth, 
[/6./] 
purgeth, and clenseth, superfluous matter, that doeth abounde, 
or offende nature. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
Then it should appere, that nature nedes no Chyrurgj. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
YEs. Nature in the tyme of Sorenes, can no more be without 
[/7./] 
the Chirurgian, then the Smithe can be without his hammer, 
or the Tailer without his Sheres: and as I haue 
saied before, although you seem to be forgetfull, yet let 
the Chirurgian be diligent, if he loue to be clothed with honestie, 
to liue vertuously, and to do thinges artificially, 
and not to giue quid, pro quo, Chalke for Chese, or Dirte for Drinke: for if 
thei so do, if it springeth of ingorance, then thei are worthy to be punished, 
and after to be reformed. But if thei bee menne of knowlege, and 
thus abbuse their pacientes, thei are worthy to be punished, as malicious 
murtherers: but here I stoppe and laie a strawe, I will meddell 
with no matters of the Lawe, I am no Iudge, although it bee good 
and the chief regiment, of our common wealth, yet I haue receiued as 
smalle profite by lawers, and vnquiet men, as wounded men get perfite 
healthe, by ignoraunte Chirurgians, or quiete men leade happie liues 
with angree wiues, for whom there is no remeadie, but pacience perforce, 
quod Socrates, to Santippa. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
IS your name Chyrurgj? Me thinke by your talke, you haue a domesticall 
grief, how helpe ye your self, when your Feuer taketh 
you, you beare out the matter as well as you can. 
 
[}Chirurgj.}] 
 
IF I be diseased of any soche Feauer, I do not intende to seke 
counsell at your handes, neither of Hipocrites, nor Galen. &c. But 
onely of Diogines, whiche loued to be a lone, & Socrates was taught 
pacience, but to conclude, no manne knoweth the grief of a 
straight shooe, but the wearer therof, but for asmuche as many handes 
make light worke, and many shoulders passe small of greate burdens, 
I care the lesser, hauing so many parteners. The remedy is this: 
when stormes be paste, faire weather come at laste. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
WEll, well, seke a salue for that sore, I can no skill of your 
disease, God wote, moche lesse to help mine owne grief, 
I praie thee therefore helpe vs bothe, yet by your leaue 
although you bee called Chyrurgj, or Sanitas, yet I dooe consider, 
that there is no continuall sanite of bodie, or 
perfecte quietnesse of mynde, duryng this life of mortalle 
menne. For if a manne would discende doune 
[^f.9r^] 
into his owne conscience, and see himself with in, he shall easely perceiue, 
the woordes written of saincte Iob the .xviii. Chapiter, in his 
moste lamentable and pitefull booke: saieth he, a man that is borne 
of a woman, liueth but a shorte tyme, and is filled full of miserie, and 
[/8./] 
commeth vp, and falleth awaie like a flower, and in the ende passeth 
awaie like a shadowe, and neuer continue in one estate. For truly we 
daiely see, aduersitie followeth prosperite, bondage after libertie, pouertie, 
after riches, sicknes, after healthe, beside an infinite nomber 
of the passions, and afflictions of the minde. As zeale, strife, gelousie, 
loue, ioye, care. &c. And as the wise manne saieth, Omnia tempus habent, all 
thinges haue their tyme. And God hath geuen affliccion to the children 
of men, to be exercised in theim, emong whom, I for my synnes 
am plagued with this kinde of maladie, as thou seest me haue: I beseche 
God of his mercie, sende me healthe, and to as many as are sore. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
THou haste spoken wisely, for al thing is in vain, where God 
doeth not put to his helping hande, and by his Prophete he 
saieth, call vpon me in the tyme of trouble, and I will helpe 
[/9./] 
thee make thee whole, and deliuer thee. Behold, how many 
Lepers, sicke of Palsies, blooddie flixes, blindnesse, defenesse, possessed 
[/10./] 
of euill spirites: yea, and death it self, all these haue God helped restored, 
and made perfecte, for there is Tempus occidendi, and Tempus sanandi with 
[/11./] 
God, for he is euer occupied, either in punishing the wicked, or conforting 
of his elected. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
WOuld GOD, there were soche miracles now a daies, as was 
then. It were a greate comfort to an infinite number of suche 
[/12./] 
as I am, neither should it be painfull, nor costly, for Christ coueiteth 
no money, although Simon magus delited in nothing els. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
SOrenes, Sorenes. Thou saiest not well, for it is rather a tempting 
[/13./] 
of God, then a beleuing in God, to looke or wishe 
for miracles, for faithfull men nedes none. And I trust 
thou art faithfull, therfore thou nedest no miracle, but 
rather consider this, Christ healed the bodies of Sicke 
menne, twoo maner of waies, the one by vertue of his 
heauenlie worde, whereby we be taught that he is God. The seconde 
he healed somtime with claie, with spitte. &c. wherein we be learned, 
and he also haue learned vs, in the tyme of our sorenes, prudentlie to 
vse Goddes instrumentes and meanes, yea, not with claie or spitte, 
yet with presious herbes, fruites, gummes. &c. For God hath ordeined 
[/14./] 
theim onelie to helpe his people, to this ende, that his people might 
serue him. Tobias healed his fathers iyes, with the gaule of a fisshe, 
an Angell prepared the medicen. Ezechias the kyng in the time of his 
[^f.9v^] 
Pestilence, was healed with a cluster of Figges. The greate Prophete 
[/15./] 
Esaie, gaue him this medicen. Eliseus did cleanse through the vertue 
of a swete tree, the foule stinkyng waters, Christ in the Gospell, commaundeth 
the Apostles to carie oile with them, to heale the sicke. S. 
Luke the holy Euangeliste was a Phisicion, and some of the antiquites 
[/16./] 
of his Phisicke, remaine vnto this daie. It is saied also that holie 
Esdras made a goodlie medicene, when the people were in captiuitie 
in Babilon, to clense them from their malancholie, and heauinesse of 
minde, whiche medicene is called after his name vnto this daie: these 
and soche like examples Sorenes, should moue thee to vse these meanes 
to helpe thee. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
I Hartely thanke you, I shall by Gods grace, obserue your saiynges, 
and vse Gods instrumentes reuerentlie, by whose meanes 
we poore menne be healed. And somtyme the riche infidels, still 
tourmented with sores. &c. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
EVen so be riche also for sicknes, as we doe daiely see, doe not 
perticulerlie dwell in poore men, but rather generally in al 
although the kindes of sicknes be variable, and the complexions 
diuers, and the causes many, and euery sicknes, and 
sorenes, haue his proper name, although men, either through ignoraunce, 
[/17./] 
shame of crafte doe abuse their names, although the effect doe 
stille remaine, as in clenlie termes by your lisence, thei will call it nothing 
els, but a sausie flemed face, redde or high coloured, when many 
times in deede, it is not onely so, but the verie Leprosie with all. It is 
nothing saie thei, but breaking out, or paines of the body, weakenesse 
of limmes, or a grene sicknes, through the obstruccion of the liuer. &c. 
with soche nicke names, whose very sure name is, the buttens of Napelles, 
Gallicus morbus comonlie called the Frenche poxe. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
HEther to yet stande I in doubt, although I be pained, how 
to name truly my desease I can not, although of it self it be 
definable, felte of me, and seen to vs bothe, and knowen 
onely to thee, what thinke you it is, I praie you tell me. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
It is none other then apostumacion, as it doeth planlie 
appere to me. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
Then I praie you, giue me a difinision, and a deuision, 
of an apostumacion. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
[^f.10r^] 
APostumacion is a verie euill disease, compounded of .iii 
[/18./] 
kindes of maledies, gathered, and growing together in 
one quantitie, firste of an euill complexion: Secondly 
a naughtie composicion, and thirdlie, the continuaunce 
[/19./] 
of time. These three maketh an apostumacion, or 
swelling within or without the body, not withsta~dyng, 
as Galen saieth, not all kinde of swellynges make apostumacions, but 
soche onely as anoieth the bodie, and the roote thereof is the corrupcion 
of the fower temperamentes, when thei bee altered, and chaunged 
into Fleume, Blood, Choller, and Melancholy, through them the 
shape of a member, is altered, when it is chaunged from his naturall 
forme, into any straunge, or deformed figure. Also the breache of continuaunce, 
is caused through insicions, corrosians, breaking, or stretchyng, 
as Galen saith, in the seconde de arte Medendi, neuer the lesse, the chief 
cause is through stretchyng, whereby the partes of the bodie bee seuered 
one from an other, and this is my conclusion of this diffinision. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
How many kindes of apostumations be there? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
THere be twoo, the one is hotte, and the other colde, for 
[/20./] 
euery apostumacion is hote or cold, touching their humour, 
but accidentallie: thei bee diuersly hotte, as Galen 
saieth, the hote haue their proper signes, to be knowen 
by, euen so hath the cold, whereby he is perceiued. Apostumations, 
wherin is boiling and burning, with continuall 
heate, is iudged to come of blood, or Cholericke humour, euen 
so iudge them of Melancholie, or fleume, when thei seme to bee colde, 
pale, deddishe, or partelie not felte, and thus thou shalt perceiue their 
[/21./] 
kindes, and although thei be named a like, yet thei differ one from an 
other in cure, as thei do in complexion. Moreouer, the apostumacion 
of blood, hath greate swellyng and heate, ouer all the body, and is seldom 
seen without some Feauer, and the colour is a dimme darke red, 
also hardnes, if you presse it with your finger, because so moche matter, 
is gathered grosselie in the place. The pulses will beate very sore, 
the matter being ouer laden, will kepe doune the artorie, and therfore 
nature attempting to rase and lifte vp the same, will cause great beating 
in the veines, wherfore the more artories be kept doun, the greater 
is the labour, and beatyng of the pulses, after whiche, sometyme 
foloweth soche dollour and pain, that all the partes of the body come 
to destruccion, as often times in hotte euell complexions, where euill 
matter is heaped togither in the apostumacio~. That in fine, replexion 
[/22./] 
and tencion, of all the course of the veines doe come, for all the veines 
in the saied apostumacion, by the meanes of the aboundance of blood, 
will swell and become great, although before, thei were right, straite, 
[^f.10v^] 
cleane: Yea, and some as small as heeres, and these bee the apostumacions 
of blood. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
What saiest thou then, of them that be Cholerike? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
APostumacions Chollerike, bee gentiller as touchyng their 
[/23./] 
swelling, but thei doe excell more in pain, and be farre crueller, 
because of sharpenesse, and bityng of humour, with bitternes, 
and drinesse of Choller, whereas bloodie apostumacions, 
although thei doe swell through moistnesse, yet the same humidite 
or moistnesse, causith the sore to be more gentler, and of lesser pain 
then the Chollerike, for thei be twoo contraries, as Aristotle saith in his 
booke of generacion, and corrupcion, Ignis qui est in vltimo continentis, non est in fine, 
ebullitionis, and in an other place, he saieth, Elementa omnia adinuicem contrarietatem 
[/24./] 
habent, and that is well saied, for heate is an extreme contrarie to colde, 
so is moistenesse to drinesse, and more paine in the one apostumacion, 
then in the other. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
What be apostimacons in quantitie, whiche of theim be 
greateste, and whiche of theim bee leaste, I would faine 
knowe, good Chyrurgj? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
AS touching their quantites, knowe you that the Chollerike, 
[/25./] 
is lesse then any other, by the reason of his drinesse, 
and heate, whiche restraineth extencion, but the 
accidence of the paine, is moste cruell and sharpe, and 
these be destriying qualities in this quantite, what time 
thei are come, to the extreme degre of heate, but apostumacions, 
depending of cold humours, soche wil bring their own proper 
signes, beatyng of the artories, not withsta~dyng thei be not comperable 
to the beating of a Chollerike, or a bloodie apostumacion but 
more duller, colder, paler. &c. You must allso note, that apostumacio~s 
[/26./] 
that spryng of blood, or choller, be diuersly termed by sundrie names, 
as botches, shingelles, fellones, pusshes, vncomes, saincte Anthonies 
fire, bleanes, bladders, or blisters, crustes, carbu~cles, pestilent sores. &c. 
euen so on the other side, apostumacions, of Fleume or Melancholie, 
haue ioined vnto them these names, as vndimies, knottes, woundes, 
Carnelles, wrates, Cankars, Esthachelles, with soche like euilles of 
mortificacion, in their beginnyng, and bee all called apostumacions, 
but when thei be growen to a ripenes, and doe breake forthe, then call 
theim vlcers, speciallie if the matter procede, to the breache of continuaunce. 
Also apostumacions are sores compounded, and standeth 
[/27./] 
not in one humour a lone, yet often times we saie simplie, that euery 
one of theim, springeth of one humour, as of heate, colde, moiste, 
[^f.11r^] 
or drie, of whom, in deede thei doe take their names, as Aristotle iudgeth 
in his Naturalles, as where blood is excessiue, it is called a Bubo, or a 
Sanguine boche, and where as Choller doeth abounde, it is called a 
Chollerike maladie. And so of the Flegmatike, and Melancholie the 
like, accordyng to their natures. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
HItherto I haue heard, but onelie the diffinicions, of the names, 
or natures of impostumacions, but me thinke to talke of the cures, 
were more profitable, for onelie vnto that ende, doe I moue 
these questions vnto you. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
I Will speake somwhat of their cuers, but or I enter any 
further in this matter: I thinke it rather necessarie, to 
speake a little of thinges that be comen, and would bee 
prudently obserued in their cures, for asmoche as euery 
apostumacion, dependeth of some cause, and maie not 
well be cured, except, cause, signe, iudgment of the same 
with effectes, be perfectly knowen. Therefore seyng there is nothing 
[/28./] 
bolder then blinde bayarde, whiche falleth ofte in the mire, nor none 
so hurtfull to the health of mankinde, as ignoraunt Chyrurgians, settyng 
the carte before the horse, and the rootes of the trees vpward, and shoteth 
at the marke like blinde men, somtyme hittyng by chaunce, more 
then by knowlege, these thinges considered Sorenes. Thinke therfore no 
time loste, to heare me speake of the causes of apostumacons, for there 
by the soner, thei maie be healed, therefore I will speake a little more 
of the causes. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
Why? Be there any more causes of apostumacons, where 
of should thei rise? I praie you shortly shewe me. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
YEs. Saieth he, whiche is the Prince of all Phisicke called 
Hippocrates, there bee three kinde of causes, where of apostumacions 
[/29./] 
doe rise, the first is the Primatius, the seconde the Antecedent, 
the thirde the Coniunctiue. The Primatiues, where meladies happen 
by misfortune to the bodie, from the outwarde partes, as insiscion, 
breakyng, smityng, fallyng, vlceracon of the handes and feete, or any 
other part, wherof insueth apostumacon. For whe~ great dolour, that 
is caused in any part, sone after it foloweth, that y=e= part anoied crieth 
vpon nature for helpe, (for suche is his goodnes and prouidence) sendyng 
out of hande some succour, to the impouerished, and sore partes. 
But it chaunceth ofte tymes, that this succour, or nourishemente, resteth 
there or some where by the waie, in y=e= vacant and weake partes, 
and so groweth it at length to an apostumacion, in case the vertue degestiue, 
or expulsiue be not able to maister, and dispache it. The Antecedent 
is diuersly named, and by diuers termes, as replecionall, humoral 
[^f.11v^] 
complecionall, and composicionall, it is called repleccionall, whe~ the 
humours increase beyonde their due measure. And albeeit all these 
haue respect to the qualitie of humours, yet for all that, when all the 
humours growe beyond measure, it is termed replexionall, humorall, 
is whe~ one humour a lone, groweth to apostumacion, as the shingles 
cometh of pure choller: and an hot botche of pure and laudable blood. 
Also thei call it complexionall, if the saied humours bee distempered 
from their first state or qualities, I saie from their first qualities, as if 
their forme in a body wer limited, within the quantitie of .ii. inches, & 
[/30./] 
then if thei had gotten the~ iii. inches more, then thereof would spring 
diuers diseases, taking their names of the qualities, y=t= haue dominion 
and preheminence of the~. It will be named compositionall, where one 
humour excedeth the rest, in degree of his qualitie, giue~ him of nature 
in compocicion, and hereof it commeth to passe, that the whole bodie 
compounded, goeth to ruine, through Feuers, and other kinde of maladies. 
Wherefore no man maie dought, that the complexcion should 
bee holden for a cause Antecedent. Some number dolour with the same 
causes, where vnto maie be added weakenes of a member, as watrishnesse, 
and windines. &c. Also a cause Coniuncte, is nothing els but the Antecedent, 
when it cometh to a place vlcerated, or well nighe vlceratyng. 
Here maie not wee passe ouer this with silence, that any apostumacion 
as touchyng ripyng, or to speake plainer, rottyng, and breedyng of 
matter, hath propertie fower tymes appropriate to it, that is to wete 
beginnyng, augmentyng, state, and fall. The beginnyng is, when the 
[/31./] 
causes Coniunct, begin presently to appere. Augmentyng is knowen in 
that it largeth, and groweth to bignes, and the accide~tes increase the 
matter gathered and heaped together, without further increasyng, 
sheweth planlie the state. Finally, the fall is knowen (if it bee well loked 
on) by a certaine softnes, and faintyng in the place. And these times 
muste bee as well obserued, I thinke, as the self maladies: for Auicenna 
with expresse wordes, giueth this admonicion, saiyng: it is not 
possible thou shhuldest cure a disease, if thou knowe not, what the disease 
is. Me thinke he dooeth inferre, and conclude, where the tymes 
be vnknowen, the cure also will be vnknowen, for why? In as moche 
as the tyme in apostumacion is diuers, the disease is diuers, and the 
cure will be diuers. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
ALthough you seme to speake som what obscurely, and darkly, 
yet by often tymes readyng, I truste to gette some more 
knowlege, for it is said of a very wise man. Omnes homines naturalisiter 
scire dederat. And I also beyng a man, am desirous of knowlege 
to helpe my self without the whiche I am the worst kind of beast, 
and moste vnprofitable vpon the yearth, but hether vnto, you haue 
spoken, but of the beginnyng of apostumacions, as semeth to me, but 
how be thei ended and fineshed. I praie you let me knowe the waie. 
 
[^f.12r^] 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
GALEN the beste that euer was, and the greatest learned 
next to Hyppocrates, and one to whom chief crede~ce must bee 
giuen as vnto a prudent Ship maister, whiche through 
connyng wisely, doe set his course in the raging seases, 
defending his Shippe from rocke, storme and tempeste, 
to the ende, to a riue at the porte, and ende of his trauel 
so doeth Galen, like a worthie maister, defende his pacientes from the 
shippe wrakes, bothe of sorenes, and sicknes, and saieth if apostumacions 
tourne not backe againe, then thei doe ende by insensible resolucion, 
or els by rotting out, and thei be ended fower maner of waies 
[/32./] 
firste by resolucion, as is aforesaid, whiche is vnbindyng, remouyng, 
or vndoyng of the matter, secondely, to conuerte, change, and tourne 
the apostumacion into a thyng, called matter, or waire. The thirde is 
by rotting. The fowerth, is putrifaccion, and of this speaketh Auicen, 
whiche is one of the chief princes of Phisicions, in thende of his chapiter, 
concernyng a hotte apostumacion, and in this cure there is two 
thinges principallie to bee obseruerd. The one is, whether the thing 
be yet a doyng, the other is, whether it be full doen, or ended, I mean 
by doyng, that is, wether the matter be yet runnyng, or fletyng to the 
place of apostumacion, and by the thing that is doen, that is, whether 
the matter be paste, and come already in to the place of apostumacion 
or not, and note also, that in all soche cures, you maie not prolong, or 
abuse the time, but diligently go about your busines, for a little loste 
tyme: put the pacient to great pain, & the Chyrurgian to great dishonestie. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
THerefore I praie you, so spende no more tyme any lenger in definisions, 
names, causes, and signes, of apostumacions, but rather 
I praie you, begin the maner of their proper cures, and 
helpes, for els hether vnto, all is but a labourinth, and a croked waie 
vnto me. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
WEll. If you will nedes take vpo~ you, to minister in your 
beginnyng, you must reparie repercussiues, which will 
greatly comfort the sore member, for Auicen saieth in his 
first booke, the fowerth doctrine, that a strong member 
actiuelie, doe caste from him his superfluous humoure, 
vnto the weake passiue or sufferyng members, and pulles 
it backe againe, and eftesones doe powre it foorthe againe, to the 
greate hurt of the weake parte, where by the weake members is often 
tymes choked, and strangled with the strength of the humour, whereby 
the whole bodie is ruined, and finally brought to destruccio~, therfore, 
to the intente that the weake part be not vtterlie destroied, ouerladen, 
or choked, with soche superfluous humour, you must, to auoide 
[^f.12v^] 
the daunger, make restraint with repercussiues, and medicenes defendent. 
And this shalt thou dooe, applie, cold, and bindyng receiptes, as 
Galen sheweth in the third of the art, saing: Repeblemus a paciente particula si infrigidemus 
& stiptica apponamus, &c. We shall put of fro~ the sicke parte, if we coole, 
and applie binding thinges. &c. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
Doe repercussiues helpe then in this case generally? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
NO. But for asmoche, as this place offereth occasion, to speak 
[/33./] 
of repercussiues, whiche I dooe laude: euen so I shall haue 
occasion to shewe, where repercussiues ought to bee abhorred 
and fledde, with no lesse care, then Shipmen doe the rockes 
in the sea. For it is no lesse pleasure to the Chyrurgian, to obtain their 
purpose, and finishe their cure, then it is ioie vnto the Mariners, luckely 
to arriue in their owne porte, or restyng place. Therefore Sorenes, to 
the ende that we maie eschue Shipwrackes, and daungerous places, 
let vs a little inlarge our course, and call to remembraunce, the wise 
wordes, of that learned man, and famous clarke (maister Ihon Vigo) 
of Genua, whiche wrote a learned booke, vnto Iulius the seconde, 
wherein he saieth, that apostumacions in vncleane bodies, doe vtterly 
refuse repercussiues, except thei be firste clensed by purgacions, for 
moche matter can not awaie with repercussion. In case we should fal 
sodainly to the cure before purgyng, then should wee greatly erre, for 
in driuyng it backward, we rather should couche it vp, in the place so 
faste, that it could not be remoued, whereby occasion should bee giuen 
[/34./] 
of euill accidence. And furthermore, if this come to passe, as God forebedde 
it should: then would it plainly emport, or threate putrifaccion 
or corrupcion of the member. Secondly, the emunctorie or cleansyng 
places, will not desire any repercussiue. Thirdly, take heede how you 
vse repercussiues, when the matter is fattie and clammie. For Galen 
saieth in the third booke of the Arte, Corpus existens plenum repercussionem non amittet. 
Fowerthly, thinke it no matter of deliberacion, concernyng repercussion, 
when the cause is venemous, cruell, or furious: but bee occupied 
wholy, in prouokyng of it forthe, for if you driue it backward, after 
mine opinion, saith Tegaltius, then doe you range farre from the high 
waie, for this is the cause, why ye shall arre, and not doe well in your 
cure. Firste, ye shall shutte and close vp the matter, within your senture, 
[/35./] 
whiche of necessitie, ought to be despersed abroade, in the whole 
circuite, and thereof will followe, by the meanes of the malice, venim 
and poison assembled together, and so takyng their force in one place 
will practise no small inconuenience or mischief, against the natural 
vertues: you shall therefore, firste vse repercussiues, if the matter bee 
pressed, stopped, thruste, or shutte vp together in one place, doe this, for 
feare of deformyng of the member, where the sore is, whiche sone will 
ensue, if it come to putrifaccion in that place. Sixtly, if nature cause 
[^f.13r^] 
any apostumacion, by the reason of crises, that is of iudgement, Hoc est 
Iudicium, to auoide, expulse, or put out matter superfluous, in this case, 
thinke there willbe no meanes founde, to put it backe, without great 
daunger, and hurte to nature. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
WHy? Would it hinder anye thing in this case, to apply a repercussiue, 
or medicene, to driue it backe: shewe me some reason 
why it should not be? Or what hurte would come thereof, if it 
were doen? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
MAry, this euill might eftesones ensue, for if it bee put backe, 
[/36./] 
or retourned in againe, nature will then inuente, and finde 
out some other by pathe, from the vnclene, to the clene places, 
and were not this a greate hurte to nature? Yes suerly, 
it wer no small ieoperdie, therefore we must in soche cases, make euacuasion 
of the matter, putting a helpyng hande to nature in her crises, 
as Gallen saieth vpon this: Aphorismus quorum crisis fit, haud facta est, &c. For the 
cure of all these causes, you muste vse mollifications, and softenyng 
medicenes. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
Yet againe, I put this question, why you doe vse repercussiues 
at any tyme? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
WE vse repercussiues, that we maie apply them, to the intent 
[/37./] 
that the matter yet fletyng, be kept of, and not that, whiche 
is alredy flowing, be come stubburne, against vs in our workyng, 
and therefore, doyng accordyng to our rules, we shall 
order and applie repercussiues in the beginnyng, and augmentyng of 
apostumacions, for why, the matter at that tyme, is chiefly flowyng 
to and fro, and Galen writeth in the thirde of his arte, that vesselles refreshed 
with binding medicens, put of moche matter from them, how 
beit this ought to be doen successiuelie, by little and little, because the 
fluxe of the matter, is with a continuance, and when it is come where 
it should be, then must it be resolued, and not driuen backe. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
I praie thee gentle Chyrurgj, take in hande the cure of 
apostumacions. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
THE prince of the Philosophers, Aristotle saieth, contraries be, 
and pertaineth to one science, and doubtlesse, the cures of apostumacions 
differ not, but in distaunce of more and lesse, 
for this cause, must I wrastle earnestelie, that the knowlege 
[^f.13v^] 
of natures, and simples escape you not, for why, the more ye shall excell 
herein, the better shall you forme your medicenes, for the pacientes 
behoue, who haue ioined them selues to our companie, now to obtaine 
this pourpose, ye shall aduisedlie looke, wether the apostumacions 
fall in a body full of humours, or voide of the same. If it happen 
[/38./] 
in an emptie body: ye shall reken it some cause prematiue, whose cure 
must be in drawing forthe from the matter, with resolutiues, or softening 
medicenes, you shall resolue, if you apply, cold and binding thinges 
together with hot and moist: with cold you must restrain, and kepe 
it of, if any parte of choller were approching, by reason of dolour, and 
with bindyng, you shal comfort the me~ber, as I said before, accordyng 
to the sentence of Gallen: that hoote thinges, cause the relentyng of the 
matter, finally, vse moistening of the same, that the pores harden not, 
nor be coagulated or stopped, and this spedely muste be doen at the beginnyng, 
afterward if it take not place, as I haue saied. What haue 
you to saie, in any other matter? 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
Shewe me some wholsome medicenne, for apostumacions, 
I praie you. 
 
[^Recipes omitted.^] 
 
[^Extract 2, ff. 16r-20v^] 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
What is then to be doen, after this businesse, I praie you 
maister Chyrurgian? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
WHen you be come to this poinct, doe your feate hardely, 
with lau~ce in hand, trimble not: disco~fort not your self, 
neither your paciente, but open thapostumacion. Som 
what in the forme of a newe Moone croked, and when 
that is doen, vse the maner of digestion, and abstarcion 
in maner as I haue saied. But as concernyng the makyng 
sounde, and the skinnyng, vse the medicen, whiche is compounded 
[/39./] 
of Vermilion. +Q. i. oile of Roses and Mirtes, ana. +Q. i. +s. This is of 
good effecte, in causyng of a seratrice, cutte or scarre, if the place be annointed 
with water of Planten, Rose water, Honie of Roses, and a 
little Allume, it shall bee verie comfortable, with a softe Sponge, to 
moiste the place: and thus haue the old auncie~t men, euer vsed emong 
[/40./] 
their miserable pacientes. Then there is an other intencion, whiche 
is verie good: whiche is to amende euill accidence, whiche comber, 
moleste, and vexe apostumacions often tymes. For if the paciente bee 
[^f.16v^] 
longe vexed with soche euill accedence, the vertue naturall will then 
decaie, and be quickly ouerthrowen: wherof will followe incontinently 
greate daunger, and moche hinderaunce to the cure of the same, 
that in fine, it shalbe scant curable: whiche accidentes be these twoo, 
the one is called ectreme dolour or paine. The other is darcknesse and 
[/41./] 
dedly blacke complexion, of the same place, these twoo bee nere hande 
desperate cures, and moste daungerous to be helped, in all apostumacions: 
 but commonly these accidentes, are found onely, to be the cause 
of euill Chyrurgians necligences. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
What moueth the Chyrurgian thus to doe? I praie you tell me. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
WHen the matter in the apostumacion, was alreadie ripe, and 
flittyng, and after the same should quickly haue been expulsed, 
or auoided by inuisible transpiracion, whiche is one of 
the forces, or benefites of nature. Then the ignoraunt Chyrurgian, 
[/42./] 
ministereth foorthe with repercussiues, which draue backwarde, 
and pressed the water so faste in the place, that these accidentes did ensue 
of necessitie. Wherefore I shall exhorte thee, my dere frende, seyng 
thou arte minded, to enter into the worthie ministerie of this worke: 
whiche is not onely profitable to thy self, but also beneficiall to the 
common wealth. That you doe vse repercussiues, namely in the painfull 
places, that maie be the occasion of riping of the matter, for feare 
that you repente you, for when matter is ones placed, then neede wee 
not but to open the pores, whiche thyng euery manne maie doe verie 
easely, if he doe resorte to the repercussiues, afore described. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
SIr, if in case these accedentes, whereof you haue spoken, be in 
this daungerous perill, it should seme then, either to be in the 
falte of the Chyrurgian, or els in the malice of the humour, what is 
then to be dooen? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
YOu shall make a plaster, with these medicenes followyng, 
[/43./] 
whiche the greate learned men theim selues, haue 
vsed vnto their pacie~tes. +R. of hulled Beanes, or Beane 
that is without the bran. l. i. of Malowe leaues. M. ii. 
Sethe theim in lye, till thei bee well sodden, and afterward, 
let the~ be stamped, and incorporated with meale 
of Linte, or Flaxe. +Q. iii. of Lupine meale. +Q. ii. and forme therof a plaster, 
with Goates grese, for this openeth the pores, auoide the matter 
by transperacion, and comforteth also the member, but if the place 
after a daie or two: when the applicacion of the plaster, fall more and 
more to blacknes: it shall bee necessarie to goe further, euen to scarefiyng 
and incision of the place, accordyng as it maie suffer. Certainlie, 
[^f.17r^] 
these are soche accidence, that will not so easly be displaced, as I haue 
talked of, but require moste prudent and circumspect deligence, of the 
Phisicions. Therefore, who so will come vnto this arte, should dwell 
no small while, with a learned Chyrurgio~, to this ende, that he maie both 
learne his saiynges and doynges, and obserue the same, and haue the~ 
euer in minde, that he maie euer bee able to trauise the aire, with his 
[/44./] 
owne proper winges, whithout the helpe of others. And not bee as a 
blinde guide, neither apte to leade, nor tracte the waie hymself, accordyng 
to profite, arte and knowlege. For in so doyng, he shalbe like vnto 
an vnconnyng Shipe maister, whiche bringeth his shippe to ruin, 
rockes, or wracke, so shall he finishe his course with shame, and his paciente 
with death. Therefore, when the place is scarified, lette it bee 
[/45./] 
doune bothe quiclie and sodenlie: then laie vpon the same skarificacion 
baie Salte. After this be doen, then applie this folowyng, in good 
order. 
 
+R. Of Bane meale, and of Orobus. ana. +Q. vi. of Lupine meale 
+Q. iiii. And boile them in Oxemell, vnto soche tyme as thei shalbe plaster 
thicke, and after applie them to the place. Or els or plaster it with 
Beanes, and Lupines, boiled in Barberie lye, and afterward strained 
and stamped in a Morter. Now perchaunce, ye see euill and corrupte 
fleshe in the place, ye shall nede no further councell in that behalf. But 
incontinente anointe the place with Vnguentu~ Egyptiacum, whiche muste bee 
[/46./] 
made after the minde of Auecen. 
 
+R. Vert degrece, Roche Alume, Honie, Viniger. an~. q~. +s. that is, as 
[/47./] 
moche as will suffice, sethe them vntill thei come in a red colour, and 
with this ointment you shall exasperate, and sharpe the place, by the 
space of twoo or three daies, notwithstanding, if you shall neede, you 
maie iterate, or often applie the same, vntill the same come to an escharous 
crust or scabbe, and make separation, whiche must not be roted 
vp by any instrument, but rather maie bee renued, with one of the 
mollificatiues, specially young Hogges greace, as it is aforesaid, and 
when this is fallen of, the same vlcer muste bee cured, as all other vlcers 
are, which I shall giue you furder vnderstanding hereafter. Now 
you doe perceiue, how putrifaction owght and must be handeled, but 
in the meane while, foresee with wisedome, that this euill be preuented, 
and auoide the same, for when a cure is not well handled, or is cast 
[/48./] 
awaie, then it is to late, to call again yesterdaie. Praier or weping in 
this case, will scant preuaile in the Chyrurgians behalfe. Now consequently, 
after I haue spoken of the asswaging, or mitagating of the dolor, 
and paine of apostumacion, whiche oppresseth nature, as the prince of 
Philosophie, called Aristotle, affirmeth, saiyng: dolour and paine, be the 
euilles that dooe dissolue, and vtterly destroie, the humaine nature of 
mankind. Wherfore it semeth necessarie, that in due order some wholsome 
waie be taken, to helpe this daungerous matter, and to auoide 
the dolour. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
[^f.17v^] 
What is beste to auoide the dolour? 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
NOthing truelie, but artificiallie to altere, and chaunge an 
euill complexion, so that it come not by stopping of the matter, 
or by the breache of continuaunce, or corosion. For then 
soche greif would aske other succours. For whereas dolour 
is fallen, it doe plainly appere, a sodaine alteracion of complexion in 
that parte, as Galen affirmeth. 
 
Therfore, if you will make any alteration in nature, inuent some 
[/49./] 
apte proper medicene, for the same purpose: as example. Take Oile of 
Roses. +Q. ii. the yolke and whites of .ii. Egges newe laied, beate them 
all to gether, and aplie them to the place, then the next daie folowing 
in the mornyng, aplie this in place or stede of the former. Take crummes 
of white bread, sodden in Goates, or Shepes milke, or els breade 
sodden in the brothe of a Chicken, or els you maie take a Wethers hed 
sodden fro~ the bones, whiche you must presse through a cotten clothe, 
from the same sodden fleshe, saue halfe a pinte of the decoction, vnto 
whiche decoction, then put to the same Honie of Roses, and oile of Camamell, 
ana. +Q. i. +s. wich yolkes of newe laied Egges. All these muste 
bee beaten together and recocted, or sodden againe vpon a softe fire 
vntill soche tyme as it bee somwhat stiffe, when this is dooen, aplie it 
warme to the dolours pained place, accordingly. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
WHat if this medicens preuaile not, what shall I doe then good 
[/50./] 
maister Chyrurgian, for I haue hard saie, that one medicen woorketh 
not health in euery complexion, but choise is good. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
THen you shall vse this, whiche followeth. For often tymes 
extreme dolour, and paines of verie necessitie, shall require 
molificacions, without daunger, wherein there maie bee 
put soche coolyng thinges, as will not hinder mollificacio~, 
thus Prince Auicen sheweth in his chapiter de flegmone therefore doe thus. 
 
Take Mallowes, Violettes. ana. M. i. seethe them, and braie them, 
and put in them. +Q. ii. of Barlie meale, of oile of Roses. +Q. iiii. and eftesones 
sethe them againe vntill thei bee in the forme of plaster thicke, 
whiche in case serue not yet the purpose, note this other. 
 
Take of Fenicreke, meale Line seedes, of flowers of Camamell, of 
Henne fatte, melted, of Rosed oile. ana. +Q. iii. Lette all these, the oiles 
and fattes onely excepted: bee mingled and sodden together, with the 
decoction of Mallowes, and Violettes, vnto soche tyme, as thei bee 
thickned, to make a plaister. This doen, warme the oile and fatte, and 
and incorporate the same, with a little oile of Camamill, and of Dill, 
and so make it to a plaster. This will open the pores, and harde pressed 
matter, whiche causeth the paine. Now if it be in the augmentyng of 
[^f.18r^] 
a maladie, in this case, ye shall make it after this forme. 
 
Take oile of Roses, and of Camomill, ana. +Q. i. +s, the yokes of twoo 
Egges. +Q. +s. of Barlie meale or more, whiche ye shall shake well together, 
and so laie it to the place. This suppose I sufficiente, for the appeasyng 
of dolour: If not, you of your owne hedde, by these maie inuent 
new, and other confections, to the behofe of your pacientes, and 
your owne contencion. Sith I haue dispatched this, I will retourne 
to an hardeined apostumacion, whiche truely, might haue been omitted 
well inough, the matter beyng so manifeste and plaine. 
 
Neuerthelesse, I will resite here, what the learned haue vsed in this 
case, because I would not maime my communicacio~. Certainly this 
inuencion shall minister diuers fetches and causes, wherin men maie 
emploie their wittes. Howbeit (accordyng as Mesuae writeth De lassitudine 
post purgationem) wee will conuerte our intent, to the cause of hardnesse, to 
the intent we maie cutte it of. For as he saieth, this is the right waie 
in cures, and the foresight in woorkyng. Wherefore, if it appere that 
the place tende to hardnes, or euer it come to that poinct, and be fixed 
it maie be redressed thus. Take ten fatte Figges, of rootes of Marishe 
Mallowes, smally chopped. +Q. vi. Seethe theim well, and then braie 
theim with. +Q. ii. of Barrowe grece: puttyng thereto a little Saffron, 
[/51./] 
where with couer the place, whiche ye would soften. And ye shall not 
faile of the purpose. But if it were so, that the praie escaped your wittes, 
or miste your fingers, you maie be sure to intrappe it with this. 
 
Take of Terebintin medled, and well incorporated with Butter, & 
this doubtles shall serue your purpose. But or euer it bee applied, the 
place must be prepared and often made moist, for riping of the matter, 
with blood warme water. Now when it cometh to rottyng, open the 
place with a potenciall Cauterie, or with some other fetche or meane 
[/52./] 
forseyng alwaie, that it bee doen, accordyng to the rules aboue mencioned. 
In fine, when it is opened, procede in the cure, as in other. 
 
These be the thinges, whiche I had this daie to saie, which though 
thei be not so finelie vttered, ne liuelie declared, as happelie ye looked 
for: ye shall beare with my simplicitie, in that behalf, For I neuer bestowed 
labour in Oratre (as I thinke ye perceiue right well) to attain 
vnto eloquence. And so, where I am simple and plain my self, I haue 
handeled soche thinges, as I had to saie, with semblable simplicitie & 
plaines, whiche if it like you, also I shall right gladly recite vnto you 
after the same order and maner: soche thynges, as we haue to vtter of 
woundes. Now, if I haue stombled or missed any where, I praie you 
[/53./] 
correcte it, so if it be worthie of correction. And on the other side, if any 
thing praise worthie, be come to light, offer and ascribe that to the 
liuyng God (as I saied in the beginnyng of our co~municacion.) That 
we maie in our self, verefie the saiyng of the Poet. Ab Ioue principium, nam 
sunt Iouis omnia plena. Of God take thinges their beginnyng, for by hym is 
all replenished, whose name bee blessed for euer. Amen. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
[^f.18v^] 
YOU haue handeled your self, verie eloquentlie and freshelie 
inough to daie, also you haue giuen vs cuppes of knowlege, 
able to quenche the thruste of better men then we are. 
And I assure you, no man maie greatly wonder at it, seyng 
we are enuironed on euery side, with soche gentle humanitie, and brotherly 
loue of eche others. Wherfore, we praie vnto God, thatfor this 
your gift, he will prospere you and your cures, and longe preserue you 
in healthe, to the behoue of your countrie, and frendes. For you haue 
quenched our thrust, aboue expectacion, with worthie communicacion 
and medicins. But to giue you warnyng, I praie you haste hether 
to morowe, with as greate and quicke spede, as ye can passe, after ye 
haue visited your cures, to the intent ye maie paie vs your promise at 
full, not without many thankes. Now therfore, sith the of your parte 
time moueth you, to attende your cures, departe in good time, and remember 
vs. For we sore people, minde to repaire hether againe to morowe, 
to heare you although the weather be verie cold. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
GO ye on in the name of God, & doubt not, but that I am yours, 
and all theirs, whiche bee either sicke, or sore, to helpe them, to 
my power. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
IT befalleth often times, if any good or euill hang ouer mennes 
[/54./] 
heddes: the deuine minde of man, hath an inglyng, and a smattering 
thereof, or euer it come to effect, whiche thing is verefied 
in our self this daie. For where we feared losse of tyme, we haue vainly 
spent all the daie, in lokyng hether and thether for you maister Chyrurgion. 
And al this together, is doen for you, wherefore to saie truth, we 
charged you with the matter, and spake liberally of you. Now therefore, 
if ye recompence it not with diligence, wee will laie all the burthen, 
in your necke, because we haue taried so long for you this daie. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
DOe you herein, as you thinke good. For I am all together 
yours, and would that you al were helped: specially, 
because ye begin plainly, to shewe your grieues. And 
this will I dooe gladlie, omittyng the definicion, in as 
moche, it liketh you so well: notwithstanding, that all 
ancie~t authours in writing of matters, thought it best 
to begin at the definicio~. But yet thei, as I thinke, were of that minde 
and opinion: where the matter was straunge and darke, and where it 
could not bee well perceiued, but the diffinicion gaue some light to it. 
And of a truth, so ought thei to doe, where cloudie darknesse and crabbishe 
knottes, requireth light and openyng by the diffinicion, whiche 
thing as I trust, shall not happen in my plain wordes. For I intende 
to speake of woundes, whiche to all men, be as plain as a packe staffe. 
For it is giuen men of nature, warely to auoide all noiaunce, and as 
[/55./] 
moche it feareth them also to be hurte, I saie that woundes be manifest 
[^f.19r^] 
to all menne. And if it were otherwise with theim, I might well 
inough beginne my communicacion, at this diffinicion of woundes. 
For it were easely saied, that a wounde is a breache of continuaunce, 
[/56./] 
newlie made, in an harde or soft parte of the bodie, being without putrifaction 
and corrupcion. Now therfore, sith there appereth no commoditie 
curatiue, to rise thereof, I thinke it beste to passe it with sile~ce 
notwithstandyng, if you be desirous of it, the saiyng, whiche is rehersed, 
maie serue the purpose. And now to begin the matter plainly, I 
suppose I maie laie the foundacion beste, in the deuision of woundes 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
YOu haue rightlie iudged. But sir, my desire is, that ye will begin, 
wheras I maie heare one long profitable tale, of the whole 
matter, and I will occupie myne eare, and kepe silence. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
I was mynded the same my self also. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
WEll, go on then, and speake to the purpose, without interruptyng 
of your talke: vnlesse where necessitie shall cause you to 
pause, or breath your self, good maister Chyrurgian. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
I Heard, my friendes and brethren saie, that there were 
[/57./] 
twoo kinde of woundes, whiche dooe no lesse differ in 
name, then in their cures. The one menne call a simple 
wounde, the other double or compounded. The simple 
is, where no substaunce is loste, and is ensounded and 
cured, with one intencion alone. And of this, wee shall 
make no further a doe, because of the facilitie thereof. For why? Coblers, 
Carters, and women bee able to cure soche woundes. Now that 
whiche is properly called a compounded wounde, is where some substaunce 
is loste: and necessarily requireth, diuers inte~cions in the cure 
as thus. To vnite that, whiche was seperated, to restore that was 
loste, and to displace an appostumacion, if it be concurraunt with the 
same. But here note, that emonges woundes, some be vncurable, and 
some curable. Therfore we will shewe you, what woundes we holden 
for mortall, and vncurable. And it is not inconueniente, to begin at 
the harte, as the chief forte, and principall pece of the bodie. 
 
Then we saie, that euery wounde, anoiyng and perishyng the substaunce 
of the hart, it is dedly and vncurable. For why? As Auicen saith 
the harte, during the naturall life, maie not suffre any breache of continuaunce. 
And therefore, to knit vp moche in one knot, soche woundes 
as giue let and impechemente to the vertue, whiche is necessarie 
to life, take mankinde awaie, without remeadie. As woundes in the 
[/58./] 
substaunce of the brain: of the winde pipe: of the wessande: of the lunges: 
of the liuer: of the gaule, of the midriffe, of the mawe: of the splen: 
[^f.19v^] 
of the small guttes, of the kidneis and bladder: and generally, al soche 
[/59./] 
woundes, whiche perce through the bulke, and inward partes, be verie 
daungerous. Because the inwarde partes bee altered, by mouyng 
of the aire, from out forthe, and the spirites bee offended within, and 
the vertue naturall, which mainteineth life, is destroied. And the reason 
why, is that, when these partes be wounded, thei be moste hardly 
helped, by reason of their continuall mouyng and labouryng. And 
when this maie not be made whole, thei be not able, ne sufficiente to 
doe their offices, requisite to nature. 
 
Now must we speake somewhat of woundes, that happen in muskelles, 
and lacertes. For thei maie bee thought as daungerous, as the 
[/60./] 
foresaid. For as in the one, be manifest tokens of death: so in the other 
be prognosticable signes, for men enflamed with high and deuine forsight. 
For a wounde in a muskell, doeth moche like a woode Snake, 
[/61./] 
whiche lieth awaite for menne out of their waie, lurkyng vnder their 
grene flowers, where he putteth theim that go by, in doubt or hassard 
of their life. Therefore my frendes, let vs reason somwhat of them also, 
that thei leade vs not forthe with vaine hope, and oppresse vs emo~ges 
other, as carelesse and idle heddes. Wherefore wee suppose, that 
woundes chauncyng, three fingers aboue and beneath, the heddes of 
the muskelles or lacertes, nigh vnto the iointes, be excedyng daungerous: 
and that prickyng of sinewes, doe often cause conuulsions, by 
reason of the greate fealyng and felowshippe, that thei haue with the 
[/62./] 
braine. Wherein the saiyng of Hyppocrates appereth true, who saith, that 
a spasme or conuulsion, chauncyng vpon a wound, is mortall for the 
moste parte. Wherefore, the woundes in soche parte, must be handled 
warelie, and with aduised deliberacio~. For why, thei will to notablie 
hinder the Chyrurgian his estimacion, if he prognosticate warelie of the 
same, to them that stande by: whiche thing trulie had, befallen to my 
self, when I promised a man his life, had not I been admonished of 
by maister Rasis, who secretly and wittely, vnknowen to all the family, 
pluckte me by the elbowe, and warned me, with these, or like wordes 
in effecte. And then the pacientes strengthe was agreable to healthe, 
and no appostumacion risen: but he slepte as he ailed nothyng at all. 
Consider with thy self, saieth he, as thou doest lightlie alwaie, the signes, 
which induce conuulsion in woundes. Where as there appereth 
no swelling in the sore, in good faithe, I conceiue an euill opinion, in 
the pacientes life, whiche I haue gotten me, with long obseruacion. 
[/63./] 
For the matter, whiche should come forthe, to the pained place, is supped 
vp of the sinewes. Wherefore, I see a conuulsion euen at hande, 
For if the matter, though it were little (for in moche it fareth a like) 
had issued & gathered to the place, it would giue me occasion to thinke 
well of him. For it should signifie, that the matter did relinquishe the 
sinewes, and drawe outward. 
 
Now in asmoche as it remaineth, as a slepe within, surely I thinke 
euill of it: and truely, it was maruailouslie saied of hym. For, or euer 
[^f.20r^] 
the fiueth daie came, the man gaue vp the breath, by reaso~ of a spasme 
or cra~pe, whereat I was greatly abashed, reseruyng the signes in memorie, 
& minde hereafter, as I also aduise you to doe. Yea, & if there be 
any other els, worthie of obseruacion, marke the vain also diligentlie 
that it maie stande you for stede, when nede shall require. For this wil 
require a vigilant iye of the Chyrurgian. Wherfore, I appeale here to your 
secrete hartes, and bid you be ware, that ye disgrace not your self thorowe 
rashenes, but be ripe in prognosticacions, and circu~specte in obseruing 
of the times, of your workinges bothe for one helpe & others. 
 
Now all other woundes, these onelie excepted, whiche I haue recited, 
no doubt be curable. And as for the helpe of these curables, there 
are twoo principall found, the one by the first intencion, the other by 
the second. The latter is, where deuided partes are ioyned totogether, 
through a porcion of an other kinde of matter. As for an ensample. 
Bones are ioyned together, with a certaine harde matter, moche like 
a bone, but not a bone, whiche is moche like to a Alasarte. The other, 
when partes are ioyned together, with their like in kinde, as fleshe 
with fleshe. And these waies, we muste nedes haue before our iyes, to 
the intente we minister not any thing in woundes, whiche we might 
afterwarde repent. Wherefore, to auoide these euils I iudge it beste, to 
begin with soche thinges, as maie bee vsed generally, in all kinde of 
woundes to helpe mankinde. 
 
[}Sorenes.}] 
 
For Gods sake shewe me the beste maner of woundes. 
 
[}Chyrurgj.}] 
 
WHen ye haue determined, to take any soche wounde in 
[/64./] 
hand: incontinent remember to obserue these thinges, 
that is to saie, an order of the life, locall medicenes, and 
amendement of euill accidentes. The firste, ye shall obtain 
by due administracion of the sixe thynges, called 
not naturall. If the Chyrurgian bee ignoraunt therein, the 
Phisicians maie rule the matter. For it belongeth to them, to giue an 
order of liuyng, to bryng humours to a qualitie, to trie out inwarde 
causes, of variable ebbyng and flowyng. And finally, to giue iuste redresse 
of the same, whiche thyng for the moste parte. Chyrurgians laboure 
not to attain to, because the matter is so secretlie hid, as it wer emonges 
stones, but onely by meanes of couetousnes, and gredie desire of 
Chyrurgians. For when thei haue gotten onely a little taste, without all 
excercise, vnder their maister, whiche thyng is mother to Arte, as Aristotle 
saieth. Thei take money hungerlie, thei seke in hande, & rent their 
skin with their teeth, makyng no conscie~ce at the matter at all. Now 
as touchyng the seconde, in appliyng of locall medicenes: ye shall not 
plaie, make or marre, ne go at all aduenture, as ye sought blindfeled. 
But perswade your self earnestlie, that you made Argus, to bee your 
companion in the matter. For in case ye misse but a little, or negligentlie 
[^f.20v^] 
omit any necessarie thyng in the cure, ye shall first bryng your self 
in a pecke of troubles, and after will ensue many inconueniences, as 
saieth Aristotle, graunte one absurditie, and many inconueniences 
[/65./] 
will folowe. Wherefore, least this doe chaunce, it is good that ye looke 
narrowlie on the matter, with aduised circumspection. Now therefore, 
when ye stande before the wounded, firste ponder with your self, 
how the wound was giuen, of what sort it is, and how large a gashe. 
For be the wounde small, and in a fleshie parte, without losing of substaunce, 
[/66./] 
it maie be cured onely with couenable bindyng. But if it bee 
greate and depe, first staunche the blood, if any be, with some medicen 
co~uenie~t, as I shall declare hereafter, in the place of bledyng & vlcers, 
wherevnto I referre at this presente. For there I entende to giue medicens, 
and meanes for that purpose. When the bloode in stanched, ye 
shall sewe the wound, with a fine threde, well twisted and waxed, betwene 
your fingers. But or I speake of sewyng, I will recite certain 
causes, where sewing is daungerous, & therefore forbidden as vnprofitable. 
And then will I to my purpose again in order for your sake.
