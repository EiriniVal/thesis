Of the parts Investing and Containing the 
whole Body: And also the lower belly 
in particular.}] 
 
[}The Præface.}] 
 
BEeing now to dissolue this goodly frame of Nature, and to take in 
pieces this Maister-piece, it shall not bee amisse to take a light suruey 
of all the parts as they lye in order, beginning with that which 
first meeteth with the sence. This body therefore, which indeede is 
but the Sepulchre of that God at first created, although to the eye 
it is very specious and beautifull, yet is it but infirme and weakely 
defended, so that the soule is truly saide Inhabitare immunitam Ciuitatem; 
for to death and diseases we lie open on euery side. The 
world is a Sea, the accidents and diuers occurrents in it are waues, wherein this small Bark 
is tossed and beaten vp and downe, and there is betwixt vs and our dissolution, not an inch 
boord, but a tender skinne, which the slenderest violence euen the cold aire is able to slice 
through. How then, may some say, commeth it to passe, that so weake a vessell should liue 
in so tempestuous a Sea, should ride out so many stormes and dangers? Surely, it is put together 
with wonderfull Art, and framed according to Geometricall proportions, which 
the English Poet hath obscurely but excellently described vnder the type of the Castle of 
Alma, that is, of the soule. 
 
The Frame thereof seem'd partly Circulare, 
And partly Triangulare: o worke Diuine! 
Those two, the first and last proportions are; 
The one, imperfect, mortall, fæminine: 
The other, immortall, perfect, Masculine: 
And twixt them two, a Quadrate was the base, 
Proportioned equally by seauen and nine; 
Nine, was the Circle set in Heauens place, 
All which compacted, made a goodly Diapase. 
 
So that truth to say, it is not the matter, whose commencements are dust, and consummation 
clay, but the excellent proportion and structure that maketh this Paper-sconce high perill-proofe. 
 
VVe list not againe to retriue the wonders we haue already sprung, least we should seem 
to mingle Yarne to lengthen out our web: our paine is as great in choise, as others is in 
want. For he that would sum vp all the rarities of Nature, which shee hath packed together 
in that goodly cabinet, had neede of the Sea for his Inke, and the sand for his Counters. 
[^p.61^] 
It shall be sufficient in this place, to draw the Curtaine and to shew you the case, rather 
the Coffin or winding sheete wherein nature hath wrapped this liuing body of death. 
Those are foure besides the haires, wherewith as with Flowers the coffin is garnished, that 
is, the Cuticle or Scarfe-skin, the skin it selfe, the fat and the fleshy Membrane. 
 
The Haires are a velature or couering for the more vncomely parts, a defence for the 
head, which we may encrease or diminish, keepe on or leaue off at our pleasure and for 
our necessity, an ornament for the face, and finally a conuenient outlet and way of expence 
for the thicke and smoaky vapors, which otherwise would smother and choake the 
Braine. 
 
The Scarfe-skin or Cuticle being voide of sense it selfe, is ordained as a muniment to 
defend the skinne from the violence of outward iniuries, to attemper his exquisite sense, 
and so become the medium or meane of sensation; to couer the Orifices or mouths of the 
Capillarie and hairy or small vessels, which determine in the skin that the blood issue not 
from them, to sucke vp the vaporous moysture which otherwise would indecently well 
out of the pores of the skin, and insensibly to euaporate the same, which we call transpiration; 
and finally, to turne the roughnesse and inequality of the skinne into a soft and slicke 
smoothnesse, and so becommeth one of the principall beauties of the body. 
 
The skin it selfe is the wall of the Castle, so quaintly framed, that the more fiercelie it is 
besieged by the cold, the more safely it doth defend, and the more strength it doth giue to 
the inward parts: and therefore Hippocrates saith, In Winter the belly, that is, the inward parts 
of the body are hotter; the reason is, because all the spirits are immured, and the Naturall 
heate restrained from vaporing forth. But when the outward enemies are departed, then 
it openeth it selfe on euery side, so cleansing the body of such superfluities, as in the time 
of constraint were contracted. 
 
Next vnder the skin lyeth the fat, a pillow to the vessels which run vnder it, a complement 
to fill vp the vacant distances of the Muscles, thereby making the body plumpe, soft, 
and better proportioned; a light and soft vesture to keepe the subiected parts warm in winter, 
and in summer to defend them from heate. Finally, a Stowage or Magazine of nourishment 
against a time of dearth: for being dissolued by the naturall heate, it melteth into 
a blood-like vapour, and returneth againe into the vessels, and so becommeth a subsidiary 
Aliment in times of Necessity, Nature being at her own finding, and teaching vs with 
how little she can content her selfe. 
 
Finally, the fleshy Membrane as an avant Mure or inward counter-scarfe, is ordained as 
a secret defence to hold out a second assault, if the outward should bee won by the enemy. 
It preserueth also the fat, that it is not molten with the perpetuall motion of the Muscles. 
It supporteth and sustaineth the passages of the vessels which run from within forth to the 
surface of the body. And to conclude, as a mound of earth within a Citie, serues to make 
vp the breaches of the wall, so doth this Membrane being fleshy, helpe to consolidate the 
skin being wounded, or otherwise violated, which without flesh was impossible to be accomplished. 
And these are the outward defences which are generall to the whole bodye. 
There are some also more particular to the lower belly, with which in our Anatomical administration, 
we must begin according to the order of Dissection: but first we wil giue you 
a generall view of all the regions & outward parts of the body, calling euery one by theyr 
names, and disciphering them in two Tables, to which wee haue added also their exposition, 
that the young Anatomist being in the beginning acbuainted with the appellations of 
the outward parts, may not be puzled in the future Discourse.

[}CHAP. I. A Diuision of the body of Man.}] 
 
DIocles Caristius in an Epistle to King Antigonus, diuides the body of 
[/1./] 
Man into the head, the chest, the belly, and the bladder. The Egyptians 
into the head, the necke, the chest, the handes, and the 
legges; we will part it into three regions, and he ioynts. The three 
[/2./] 
regions are, the vpper which is the head, the middle which is the 
chest, and the lower which is the belly. The vpper region or the 
[/3./] 
head, is circumscribed or limited by the crowne, and the first racke 
bone of the necke. The second Region the later writers do call venter 
medius, or the middle belly and the chest. Hippocrates in his Aphorismes calleth it the 
vpper belly, but in reference to the lower: and the chest in his Booke De Arte, is taken for 
the whole trunke of the body, for he writeth; that the Liuer is scituated in the Chest. This 
[/4./] 
second or middle Region is likewise limited by his bounds, the vpper part with the Clauicles, 
so called, because they do claudere, that is, shut vp the Chest: we call them patelbones: below, 
with the brest blade and midriffe, which like a partition wall distinguisheth this middle 
from the lower region. On both sides it is enclosed with twelue Ribs, before with the

brest bone, behind with the backe: round about, on the outside, with many Muscles, on

[/5./] 
lower belly, circumscribed aboue by the breast blade and the Midriffe: below, by the hip-bones, 
the Haunch bones and the share bones: behinde, by fiue racke bones of the loines, 
and the holy or great bone; and before, by the whole Abdomen or paunch. The rest of the 
[/6./] 
body we call the Ioynts, in Latine artus, and those are the armes and the legges, which like 
boughes or branches, grow out of the trunke of the body. In the vpper region, are contained 
[/7./] 
the Animal organs, that is, the braine, which is the seate of the soule, and the original 
or fountaine of sence and motion. In the middle region, are contained the vitall parts, and 
parts seruing for respiration, as the Heart, the Lungs, and the arteries. In the lower region 
are contained all the naturall organs seruing for concoction of nourishment, expurgation, 
[/8./] 
of excrements and procreation. And therefore the vpper Region is called Animall, the 
middle Spirituall, and the lowest Naturall. The vpper is walled about on euery side with 
bones, as it were a strong bulwarke or peece for defence, because in it, the soule which is 
[/9./] 
the Queene of this Little world, keepeth her residence or state. The middle is partly bony, 
and partly fleshy: bony, for the strength of the heart, and to frame the cauity; and fleshye, 
for the more facile motion of the Systole and Diastole. The lower region is before altogether 
[/10./] 
fleshy, that it might better bee contracted and distended, and swell into a greater 
[^p.64^] 
proportion for the concoction of the aliment, in the suppression of the excrements, & for 
the contayning and increase of the infant. In which position who can but admire the 
wonderfull prouidence of the Creator? The Animall Region hee hath set in the highest 
[/11./] 
place, as well for the conueniency of the sences (for the voyce is better heard from aboue; 
the smell receiueth best an ascending vapour, and the eyes which are as scout watches and 
spies, doe see furthest from aboue) as also because it was conuenient that the principall faculties 
of the soule should be as farre distant as they might fro~ the noysome vapors which 
doe exhale from the partes where the aliment is concocted and the excrements are retayned. 
[/12./] 
The spirituall Region, which is the well-spring of heate and source of life, is placed in 
[/13./] 
the middest, that it might difuse his sweet influence as well into the lower as into the vpper 
parts. The naturall Region as it were the kitchin, is built neere the ground, that the excrements 
might better settle from the more noble parts, and bee also more cleanly conuayed 
away. And this shall suffice for a briefe diuision of the whole body, and description of the 
three regions, through all which we will walke at more leasure, to obserue the diuers parts 
therein contayned. But our perambulation shall not bee in an order answerable to the 
[/14./] 
dignity of the parts, but rather Anatomicall. For they that dissect dead bodies, doe first open 
the lower region, which because it is the sinke of the body, will soonest bee corrupted 
vnlesse the parts therein contayned be taken away. We therefore from it will commence 
our discourse. 
 
[}The diuision of the inferior or lower belly. CHAP. II.}] 
 
THE inferior or lower venter, which wee commonly call the Belly, in greeke 
[^GREEK OMITTED^]; is almost the middle part of the bulke or trunke of the body, distinguished 
[/15./] 
from the chest by the diaphragme or midriffe; and is circumscribed or 
bounded aboue by the breast blade at the end of the breast bone, below, at the 
share bone: before, by that which is properly called the abdomen or paunch. 
(for some call all the lower belly by that name, whence those that are great gormandizers 
are sayd to be nati Abdomini, that is, borne for their bellies) behind, by the spondels or rack 
bones of the loynes, and the sacred or holy bone; on both sides, by the ribs the bones of 
the hippes and haunches. This Venter, because it was to containe the members of generation 
& nutrition both, hath allotted vnto it the most ample cauity or hollownes of the 
[/16./] 
whole body. It is therefore placed below, that it might better receiue the recrements or excrements 
of both concoctions, and more easily and cleanly conuay them away. Before 
[/17./] 
and on both sides it is fleshy, that it might bee dilated or stretched out, as well for the receiuing 
of nourishment as for the contayning the increase of the wombe, or else bee compressed 
[/18./] 
and straightned when need shall bee for the exclusion or auoyding of excrements. 
 
It is deuided into two partes, the fore-part and the hinder-part; The fore-parte 
[/19./] 
which Galen calleth [^GREEK OMITTED^], and the Arabians (though their part of Anatomy wee may 
[/20./] 
without great detrement to our Art forget) Mirach, Galen deuideth into three parts: 
The Hypochondria, the Region of the Nauill, and thje Water-course or Hypogastrium: wherfore 
in imitation of him wee also wil deuide it into the Vpper, the Middle, and the Lower 
[/21./] 
Regions. 
 
The Vpper, which is limited by the sword-like cartilage or the breast-blade and the 
[/22./] 
end of the ribs, hath three parts; two latterall or side-parts properly called Hypochondria, 
[/23./] 
because they are vnder the gristles of the bastard ribs, for so much the greeke worde signifieth. 
[/24./] 
Celsus by a like kinde of notation calleth them præcordia, because they bee vnder the 
mouth of the stomacke, which the ancient Greekes called by the same name with the hart. 
[/25./] 
In the right Hypochondrium is placed the greater part of the Liuer; in the left, the spleene 
and the greater part of the stomacke: the third part of the vpper Epigastrium, which also 
standeth in the front, hath deseruedly gotten the name of the whole, and is truely called Epigastrium, 
[/26./] 
because the stomacke lyeth vnder it, which by an excellency is called Gaster or 
the belly. In this place is that cauity which the latter writers call Scrobiculum cordis, the 
[/27./] 
hole or spoone of the Heart, the ancients called it Cardia. The middle part of the Epigastrium 
is the Region of the Nauill; it is circumscribed on both sides, with the endes of the 
ribs; & they right line of the haunch bone it hath likewise 3. parts: two laterall which Galen 
calleth [^GREEK OMITTED^], i. void because the place is without bones: & Aristotle [^GREEK OMITTED^], because the are 
[^p.65^] 
laxe and loose; some call them Ilia, we call them the flankes. On the right side the blind 
[/28./] 
gut, and a part of the Collicke gut, and a part of the empty gut called i_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]unum. The third 
part of this middle Region of the Epigastrium is the front, where the Nauill is seated called 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], or Vmbilicus; this is the very center of the body, and vnder it lyeth almost all the 
empty gut. 
 
[/29./] 
Vnder this Region of the Nauill, is the lower Region and third part of the Epigastrium, 
and it reacheth as farre as the share-bone. It beginneth at the spine or swelling of the vpper 
circumference of the haunch bone, and if you draw a line crosse from either side vnto 
the middle space betwixt the nauil & the spines or protuberations of the share-bones, you 
haue the full extent of this watercourse. Of some in a large signification it is called the little 
belly, but more strictly they would haue it to be that part onely wherein the bladder is 
[/30./] 
contayned, following as it should seeme Diocles Caristius, who deuided the body into the 
head, the breast, the belly, and the bladder. This small belly is distinguished from the greater 
by a certaine fence or mound, made of the production of the Peritoneum or the rim: 
which production stretcheth from the necke of the bladder by the backe part, and the bottome 
thereof euen vnto the nauill, and this production is vpheld and sustayned by three ligaments: 
two of which are called the Vmbilicall arteries, and the 3. is called Vrachus. This 
[/31./] 
little belly Hippoc. calleth [^GREEK OMITTED^], and Galen Hypogastrium, the Latines Aqualiculus, because 
[/32./] 
the excrements haue in it their Rendevous or place of assembly: for in the fore-part it hath 
[/33./] 
the bladder and the gut called Ileon, in the hinder part the right gutte, and betwixt these in 
[/34./] 
women is the seate of the wombe. This little belly is also subdiuided into three parts, two 
[/35./] 
laterall and a middle; the laterall reacheth to the place where the haire buds, and are called 
by Celsus, Ilia; because they contayne the gut called Ileon, and the spermaticke vessels; 
[/36./] 
we call them the flankes. The middle or forepart reaching to the very yard, is properly 
called Hypogastrium; whose right and left partes which in the bending of the thigh, side or 
[/37./] 
leane to the share-bone, are called by Aristotle Boubones (which name those tumors that 
[/38./] 
arise in these parts doe yet retaine) by the Latines Inguina, which is with vs properly called 
the leske. The third and forepart of this Hypogastrium, where the haires growe tufted and 
[/39./] 
ranke, is called by Hippocrates and Aristotle [^GREEK OMITTED^], in Latin Pecten or Pubes, with vs the groine; 
[/40./] 
yet Pubes doeth more properly signifie the Downe or Cotton when it ariseth about those 
[/41./] 
parts in men, neare vppon the fourteenth yeare; in women about the twelfth; and it is a 
[/42./] 
signe of maturity or ripenesse. For (that I may vse Hippocrates wordes in his booke de 
[/43./] 
Nat. pueri) assoone as the passages are open for the seede & monthly courses; the hayre 
[/44./] 
or downe in a boy or girle starteth vp, the skinne being rarefied or made thin. Vnder these 
are the Priuities, called Pudenda; the very name carrying the remembrance of our shame 
and of our sinne. 
 
The backe part of the inferiour Venter or lower belly, is limited by the end of the ribs, 
[/45./] 
and the extremity of the rump-bone, this part some call [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is, Cinctum, the girdle-stead, 
giuing the name from the vpper part; or if you will subligaculum, the breeches, for 
the greeke word will beare both, and then it taketh his name from the whole. 
 
It is diuided into an vpper and an vnder part: the vpper is from the bending of 
[/46./] 
the Backe vnto the Buttocks, which makes the Loynes, Aristotle calles them [^GREEK OMITTED^]; the fleshy 
parts on either side are called in greeke [^GREEK OMITTED^], Pulpa a palpando, in imitation whereof wee 
call it the Fillet, as it were Feele-it. On the right side, lies the right kidney, and on the left 
side, the left. Below the loynes are fleshy and globous or round parts diuided by a fissure 
called by Herophilus [^GREEK OMITTED^], by vs the cleft. Aristotle calleth them [^GREEK OMITTED^], because they sustain 
a man when he sits, and we call it mannerly the seate: he calleth them also [^GREEK OMITTED^], in Latin 
Nates, ab innitendo, because they serue in stead of quishions to sit vppon, wee call them the 
buttocks. Betwixt these is the Coccyx or rump-bone, and vnder them as in a low valley, lie 
the very end of the right gut and the place of siege, the port esquiline or the fundament. 
 
[}Of the composition or frame of the lower belly. CHAP. III.}] 
 
THE inferior or lower belly consisteth of two sorts of parts; one called Continent 
[/47./] 
or Contayning and investing parts, the other parts Contained. The 
inuesting or Contayning parts which properly make the Abdomen, (for they 
hide and conceale the bowels or entralles and the guttes scituated in this lower 
belly, called therefore of the greekes [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is, aboue the belly) 
[^p.66^] 
are also of two sorts, Common or Proper. The common, are the Cuticle or the curtaine 
[/48./] 
or scarfe-skin; the true skin; the fat and the fleshy membrane: for they encompasse all 
the whole body, excepting some particular parts, as we shall shew afterward. The proper 
[/49./] 
inuesting parts are the Muscles of the paunch, or of Abdomen; and the peritoneum or the 
Rim of the belly; for these are proper to the lower belly, euery venter hauing his proper investure 
vnder the common containing parts. And of these we will intreate in order, sauing 
of the Muscles, which wee will referre into their proper place, in the Booke of the 
Muscles. 
 
[}CHAP. IIII. Of the Haires of the whole body.}] 
 
THE haires in Greeke, are called [^GREEK OMITTED^] quasi [^GREEK OMITTED^], [^GREEK OMITTED^], [^GREEK OMITTED^], because wee 
[/50./] 
mowe or poule them. Persius cals them Cirri, from the Greek verbe [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
which signifieth to cut. In Latine they are called Pili. Almost euery liuing 
creature that ingendreth within it selfe is furnished with this couering, 
some more, some lesse: and yet there are, which in stead of haires, haue 
[/51./] 
prickes, as Hedge-hogges and Porcupines; others haue Feathers, as Birds (& therefore 
the sauour of Feathers and haires when they are burnt are alike,) others Scales, as Fishes. 
 
Haires are bodyes engendred out of a superfluous excrement of the third concoction, 
[/52./] 
torrified by the naturall heate; and they grow especially where the skin is thinnest & most 
temperate, and where there is for theyr nourishment some proportionable quantitie of 
moysture. So that for their generation or production and their conseruation, foure things 
[/53./] 
are required. The heate for an efficient cause, the Matter, out of which they are generated 
or produced, a conuenient place for their production, and fit and competent nourishment, 
or rather apponed matter to be continuallie ministred for theyr preseruation. 
 
The Matter of the haires is either remote, or more immediate. The remote matter is a 
[/54./] 
superfluous moysture, which the kernels or Glandules which are disposed in the sobby and 
[/55./] 
waterish places of the body could not sucke vp; which moysture therefore is thrust out into 
the skin. Hence it is, wheresoeuer there are any Kernels there are also haires: & 
[/56./] 
verily Hippocrates in his Booke de Glandulis, assigneth the same profit vnto them both. The 
Glandules to receyue that matter which applyeth vnto them; the haires to gather it into 
their nourishment or for their production, being expelled by nature as a superfluitie. So 
we see there are Glandules behinde the eares where also are haires, vnder the arme-pittes 
haires and Glandules; in like manner in the flankes and the groyne. And if in anie part 
[/57./] 
there be Glandules and no hairs, Hippocrates in the place next aboue quoted, rendreth the 
reason, because there is too great plenty of moysture. For wee see that in sobby and sucken 
grounds seede will not take roote, nay the grasse it selfe will not grow where the water standeth 
continually. 
 
The next and immediate matter of the haires, according to Galen in the fifte chapter of 
[/58./] 
his second Booke de Temperament: is a sooty, thicke and earthy vapour, which in the time 
of the third concoction, when the aliment is turned into true nourishment of the parts, is 
eleuated by the strength of the action of naturall heate, and passeth thorough the pores of 
[/59./] 
the skin. The efficient cause is as we saide, a moderate action of the naturall heate, which 
exiccateth or drieth this moysture or these sootie and thicke vapours, and thrusteth them 
out by the transpirable passages of the skinne. For the vapour being thicke, in his passage 
leaueth some part of it selfe, to wit, the grossest, in the very outlet where it is impacted, & 
by a succeeding vapour arising whe~ce the former did, is protruded or thrust forward; and so 
[/60./] 
one vapour continually solliciting and vrging another, they are wrought together into one 
body: euen as in chimneyes we see by the continuall ascent of soote, long strings of it are 
[/61./] 
gathered as it were into a chaine. The difference is, that the straitnesse of the passages of 
the skin, where through the matter of the haires is auoyded, formeth them into a small 
roundnesse, euen as a wyre receyueth that proportion whereof the hole is, where through 
it is drawne. 
 
The manner of the out-gate of this matter, is thus. When by the continuall appulsion or 
[/62./] 
arriuall of such vapour to the skin, the pores are plenarily obstructed, then the next vapour 
that striueth to be at liberty, smiteth the former; which by reason of the straitnesse of the 
passage, is driuen out into the forme of a cord. He that would see an expresse image of this 
manner of production, let him resort to Glasier, when he extendeth his mettall into the 
[^p.67^] 
guttered lead wherein he fastneth his glasse, and he shall perceiue how the artist hath made 
an engine, whereby an inch of lead is driuen out into a foote of length. It was necessary 
therefore sayth Hippocrates in his booke de carnibus, that this sooty excrement should haue 
[/63./] 
a clammy or glewy substance, yet without any fatnesse or greasinesse at all. Wherefore, 
wheresoeuer in the body, especially in the outward parts, there gathereth together any such 
glewy or clammy excrement, there the naturall heat bringeth forth haires; and this is the 
cause why in the arme-holes and about the priuy parts, yea and in all the rest of the body 
haires growe plentifully. Now that part of the haire that is impacted in the pores of the 
[/64./] 
skinne, may fittely bee resembled to the roote of an hearbe sticking in the ground, and that 
which beareth out of the skin, to the hearbe it selfe. 
 
[/65./] 
There is also required a conuenient place, as a foundation wherein the rootes of the 
haires may be established, and that is the skinne, which of all other parts is fittest for their 
breeding, sayth Galen in his first chapter of the second booke de Temperamentis; because it 
is neither too dry nor too moyst; for as neither in Marrish and Fenny ground, nor in one 
that is ouer dry and worne out of heart can any thing bee brought forth: so in an ouer 
moyst or ouer dry skin no haire can grow. For though the skin be accounted dry, yet in a 
man it is not without some moysture, as it is in those creatures which are couered ouer 
[/66./] 
with a stony or crusty shell; as Oysters, Lobsters, Crabs and such like; and in such as lurke 
in dennes, as Snakes; and those that haue scales, as Fishes; in all which haire cannot grow, 
[/67./] 
because their skinnes are truely and altogether dry. Moreouer, the skin ought not to be 
too soft and moyst, like Cheese new curded; for then it would not holde the rootes of the 
hayre because of his thinnes; and beside, after the pores were as it were bored by the excrement, 
they would fall together again, the parts being so fluid that they would run into one 
[/68./] 
another and bee exquisitely reunited: But moderately dry to hold the haire to his roote, 
and moderately hard, not vnlike a cheese already well gathered and somewhat pressed, for 
so it would bee better thrilled and perforated by the issuing humour; which perforations 
also would remaine, the dry body not suffering the parts to reunite, but to consist, and so 
by the continuall exiture of the matter, the pores would bee more fistulated. It must also 
be slack and thinne. Wherefore considering the whole skin is full of pores, whereout somthing 
is continually breathed by the naturall heate which disperseth, attenuateth, and carrieth 
away with it selfe no small part of the inward moysture, it followeth, that in all parts of 
the body the haires may issue forth, euery pore hauing a haire in it to keepe it open, for the 
better breathing or thrusting out of exhalations: yet we must except the skin of the palms 
and soales of the hands & feet, because, as some say, in the~ there is a large Tendon immediatly 
vnder the skin, which being exceeding thicke and dry, makes it vncapable of haires; 
but I cannot admitte of that reason, seeing a Hare hath also that broad tendon, and yet 
[/68./] 
hath not those parts voyde of haire. Therefore wee say that nature hath made those partes 
hairelesse, both for vse that they might be the more sensible, as also for motion. 
 
Now that the thinnes of the skin is required for the production of haires, it appeareth 
[/69./] 
by the example of scarres; for if you raise a blister by scortching the vpper skin or cuticle, 
after it is healed, and the vpper skin is growne thicke no haire will rise out of the scarre, because 
[/70./] 
it hath no pores in it. 
 
[/71./] 
The haires be of two kinds, some are [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is, congeniti, bred with vs, as the haire 
of the head, of the eye-browes, of the eye-lids. These are bred in the child while it is yet in 
the wombe, and are resembled not vnto hearbes that grow by sowing, but vnto such plants 
as nature bringeth forth of her owne accord: and such do not necessarily follow the temperature 
of the body. 
 
[/72./] 
Other haires are called [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is, postgeniti, bred after the skin is growne thin, 
which hapneth in Boyes when they beginne to breed seede, in Girles when their monthly 
courses begin to flow; these come out in three places, answerable to the three places where 
nature bringeth forth the former kinde; First about the priuities, secondly vnder the arme 
[/73./] 
holes, thirdly in the chin and cheekes. Those that are gelded before the age of foureteen 
yeares, haue no haires growing on their chinne: the reason is, because the wayes of the 
seede are not opened, and by castration are after intercepted; and therefore the skinne 
doth not rarifie: if after those haires be growne the Testicles be taken away, those haires 
also fall, excepting in the groyne. Againe, in women those hayres which wee called postgeniti 
doe arise later, neuer in the chinne, because there is not so great agitation of the humor 
in the act of generation in women as can rarifie the skin so farre from the place where 
[^p.68^] 
the seed is engendred; and yet wee see, that in some women after their Courses are staide, 
[/74./] 
the haire begins to bud on their chins. It may also fall out, that both men and women may 
be without any of the postgeniti by some naturall defect, contracted in their generation. 
 
The forme of the haires is expressed by certaine accidents; for they do vary in thickenesse 
and thinnesse, hardnesse and softnesse, length and shortnesse, streightnesse and curlednesse, 
[/75./] 
multitude or scarsity, as also according to the quality of the skin, and the naturall 
propriety or condition of the parts in which they are fixed. Moreouer, they differ in colours, 
[/76./] 
whitenesse and blacknesse, and middle colours betweene them; so also by reason of 
age, and growth of the body. The chiefe cause of their thicknesse or thinnesse is the skin 
saith Aristotle, 5. gener. Animal. _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. which in some is thicke, and in others thin; in some rare, 
[/77./] 
and in others thight and compact. Another cause is the variety of the moisture lying vnder 
the skin, for in some it is clammy, in others waterish: so out of a thicke skin, thick & hard 
haire, and out of a thin skin, thin and slender haires are produced. 
 
And if the skin be rare and thicke, the haires are also thicke, by reason of the abundance 
of earthly substance, and the laxity of the passages. But if the skin be more thight and compact 
though it be thicke, they come out thin, by re_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]son of the narrownesse of the passages. 
So if the vapour whereof they are bred be waterish, because it is quickly dryed vppe, they 
growe not much in length; but if it bee clammy and glutinous, because it is not easily 
dried vp, they spread themselues in length. So that the cause of the length and shortnesse 
of haires, is the abundance or scarsity of the humor wherewith they are fed. And 
[/78./] 
hence it is, that the haires of the head are the longest of all the bodie, because the Braine 
[/79./] 
affoordeth a great deale of a clammy moysture, and because the braine is bigger then the 
other Glandules; they are also crasse or thicke, because the skin of the head is exceeding 
thicke, yet rare and containing much moisture. The haires of the head in Latine, are called 
[/80./] 
Capilli, quasi capitis pili: in Greeke [^GREEK OMITTED^], from [^GREEK OMITTED^], which signifieth to cut. In men they 
are called Cæsaries a freque~ti cæsione, because they are often cut: and in Women Coma, because 
they bestow great paines in combing and curling them. They are also in Woemen 
diuided by a line, which in Greeke is called [^GREEK OMITTED^], in Latine discrimen, in English the shed. 
Now the haire is either straight or curled, eyther by reason of the exhalation it selfe, or 
of the pores whereout they passe. Of the exhalation the vvhich of being smoaky, 
[/81./] 
by the heate and drought maketh the haire curled. For it hath a double course, 
the earthy and dry part downeward, the hot part vpwarde: hence it boweth not downe 
right, but wrinkingly, because there is in it but little moisture, & much dry and earthy matter; 
and this we may perceiue, if we parch haires in the Sun, or neare the fire: for the crisping 
of the haire is as it were a kinde of convulsion because it wanteth moisture: or else we 
may say, the haire curleth by reason of the drinesse of the temper; and therefore all Black-Moores 
haue curled or crisped haire. 
 
By reason of the constitution of the pores wherein they are implanted. For 
[/82./] 
when the exhalation is so weake, as that it cannot make a straight way for it selfe, it 
giueth a forme to the pore answereable to it owne contortions. But if the exhalation bee 
[/83./] 
strong enough, yet it cannot ascend directly vpwardes, by reason of the hardnesse of the 
skin, then it turneth side-long, like as we see the smoake and the flame when it is hindred, 
to mount streight vpwards, diuideth it selfe and turnes aslant. Wherefore both by reason 
of the imbecility of the exhalation, and of the hardnesse of the skin, the roots of the haires 
grow awry. Now it standeth with good reason that they should growe and continue still 
such as they were framed at the roote. For no hard or dry body can be extended streight 
forth, vnlesse it be first softned and mollified. 
 
Those that haue aboundance of moisture, and the pores streight, haue their haire also 
streight. Againe, long haires are soft, but the curled are hard. Moreouer, haires encrease 
[/84./] 
& grow more or lesse according to the Nature of the skin, and the condition of the parts 
where they are implanted. In the head they grow in greatest length and abundance, next 
in the Beard, because that skin is moderately hot & dry, especially when the haires are fine 
and slender. But the haires of the eye-browes and of the eye-lids, are smal and grow not almost 
at all: but for the most part, keep alwayes an equall magnitude, and seldome fall, because 
they haue vnder them a hard body, like vnto a gristle. For those haires that spring 
from soft and moderately moyst parts, encrease very much, as those of the head and the 
beard; and Galen addeth those of the arme-pits, and about the priuities: but those that arise 
out of hard and dry places, are small and almost of no growth: yet in some the eye-browes 
[^p.69^] 
grow so hairy in old age, as that they are constrained to cut them, or else they 
[/85./] 
would offend their eyes. Haire buddeth in the chin, when the skin beginneth to rarifie or 
grow thin; the matter of it is a moysture sent thither from the head, as Hippocrates holdeth 
in his Booke de Natura pueri, and these haires make the Beard, which is not alike in euery 
man; for some about their chin and lips haue great store of haire, some haue no haire 
there, but very much on their cheekes. 
 
Aristotle in the third Booke de Histor. Animal. the 11. chapter saith, that the haires vse 
to grow extraordinarily in some diseases, especially in consumptions; hee addeth also, in 
old bodies and dead corpes they receiue augmentation both in length and thicknesse, but 
do not spring anew. 
 
They varie likewise in colour, and are answerable to the predominant humor, for such 
[/86./] 
as the humor is which the flesh draweth vnto it (saith Hippocrates,) such also is the colour 
of the haire. 
[/87./] 
 
Galen in his second Booke de Temperamentis, and the fift Chapter, saith, that the haire 
becomes blacke, when the vaporous excrement scorched by the heate is changed into a 
[/88./] 
perfect soote; and somewhat red, when the excrement impacted in the passage is not yet 
[/89./] 
altogether growne black; but yellow, when the vapour is lesse scorched; for the excrement 
[/90./] 
that is so impacted, proceedeth of yellow and not of blacke Choller. White haires are 
made of Flegme, and the colours betwixt these of a mixture of Flegme and choller. 
 
But a question may be asked, why in Beastes the colour of the haire followeth the colour 
[/91./] 
of the skinne; and in men it is far otherwise; far the whitest men and women, haue often 
haire coale blacke. Aristotle maketh answere 5. de generatione Animal. 3. and 3. Histor. 11. 
Because, sayth hee, a mans skin is thinner then the skin of any other Creatures of his magnitude; 
and therefore the skinne cannot affoord any matter of haire of it selfe, or reteyne 
the excrement driuen to it so long as to giue it his owne colour. 
 
The haire varyeth also by reason of the region and the diuerse dispositions of the ambient 
[/92./] 
ayre; so those that inhabite a hotte and dry country, haue hard, blacke, dry curled and 
brittle haire, and of small growth, as the Egyptians, Arabians and Indians: contrariwise 
those that inhabit in a moyst and cold climate haue soft haires which grow moderatly, are 
small or fine, straight and reddish, as the Illirians, Germans, Sarmatians and all the coast of 
Scythia, as Galen sayth. But such as inhabit a temperate tract betweene these, haue hayre 
of greater growth, exceeding strong and somewhat blacke, moderately thicke, neither altogether 
curled, nor altogether straight. 
 
They vary also by reason of age; for little children haue little haire, because as yet their 
[/93./] 
skin hath no pores, nor any sootie excrement applying vnto it: when they beginne to 
cotten, which is about xii. and xiiii. yeares of age, their haires are small and weake; but as 
their youth growes strong, and their flourishes grow vpon them, which is towards xv. & 
xviii. then their haires grow many, great and strong, as well because their skin is growne 
full of pores, as also for that they abound with sootie excrements. 
 
Those that are well in yeares haue hard haire, because their skin becomes hard & thicke 
in old age, by reason of their coldnesse and siccity. So we see some men when they grow 
in yeares, become bald eyther for want of hot and clammy moisture, or because naturally 
[/94./] 
and originally their skin was somewhat too dry, or else as Hippocrates saith, because they abound 
with Flegme, which being stirred in their heads by carnall copulation, and so growing 
hot; when it arises into the skin, it scorcheth the rootes of the haire and so causeth 
them to fall off; and that is the reason, why neyther Eunuches nor children vse to growe 
balde. Now this baldnesse begins commonly in the forepart of the head, because (saieth 
Aristotle 5. generat. Animal. 3.) it is dryest, for there the skin lyeth vpon the bare bone, without 
any interposition of fat, as it is in the Nowle. 
 
In like manner, Men growing olde become gray-headed; not by reason of drought, 
for we see often that many haires become gray together, but nothing can vpon a suddaine 
[/95./] 
become dry: the true cause is putrifaction for want of ventilation, and therefore those 
that haue their heads continually couered, grow sooner hoary then others, as Aristotle 
[/96./] 
obserued. Galen in his second Booke de Temperam. and the 5. chapter, saith, that before the 
skin of the head is growne to extreame drinesse, the haires become weak for want of conuenient 
foode, and white because the nourishment wherewith they are fed, is as it were 
the dregges of Flegme, which in processe of time remaining about the skin, do putrifie. 
 
Of all parts the Temples are first hairy, because they are very moyst by reason of the 
[^p.70^] 
great Muscles which lye vnder them. Now euery Muscle is fleshy, and flesh is moyster 
then eyther bone or skin. Next vnto them, the forepart of the head growes white; last of 
all, the haire about the priuities and the eye-lids; but no body growes bald in the temples 
or in the hinder part or nowle of the head. 
 
The haires are fed by moysture, therefore Hippocrates saith, they grow most plentifully 
[/97./] 
where they finde moderate moysture for their foode, which Aristotle saith, is disposed 
at their roote; for if you plucke them vp, that moysture is drawne vp with them: besides, 
the haire is thicker at the roote then in the rest of his length, because it hath some of that 
moisture newly applyed to it. From these humors are exhalations raised, and nature turnes 
the thickest and clammiest of the excrements, into the nourishment of the haires. Therefore 
when they are well fed, and with lawdable aliment, they encrease apace, and are moderately 
crasse or thicke. But when they are cut, they do not beginne to grow vp againe 
where the Sheeres diuided them, but at the root, from whence they issue, and so they encrease 
and are nourished by apposition, as the teeth are; not by the excrements of faultie 
and vicious humors, but by excrements of the third concoction: otherwise, they would 
not fall off, but rather encrease in those that haue the French disease and the Leprosy, considering 
that in such bodies the Excrements of vicious humours are exceeding aboundant. 
 
The vse of haires in generall is foure-fould. First for a couer; secondly for a defence; 
[/98./] 
thirdly for an ornament vnto the partes vnder them; fourthly to consume and waste away 
the thicke and fuliginous or sooty excrements. So the haires of the head which are in great 
aboundance, (for of all creatures a man hath most haire on his head) do couer the braine, 
and shelter it from ouer much cold or heate. For mans braine being in proportion greater 
[/99./] 
and moyster then any other creatures, it requireth accordingly a more carefull guarde 
and preseruation; for that which is the moystest will most easily grow hot and cold againe. 
And because the brain is seated farre from the fountaine of heat, and neare vnto the bones, 
and vnder them is not couered with any fatnesse; the haires are prouided both to fence it, 
and to keepe it warm. They also waste and consume the thicker excrements; and because 
it is not behoofefull for vs that wee keepe our heades alike couered in all ages of our life, 
times of the yeare, countries and constitutions of bodies; therefore we may fit our selues 
vnto the times, & weare them either longer or shorter; but if they be altogether shauen 
off, they proue the cause of defluxions. The haires of the head haue not onely this vse to 
couer the cheekes and chinne (which women doe with veiles and maskes) but also they 
serue for ornament. For it is a venerable sight to see a man when he is come to the yeares 
fit for it, to haue his face compassed about with thicke and comely haire. Nature therefore 
hath made the vpper part of the cheek and the nose without haire, least the whole face 
should be wilde and fearce, vnbeseeming a milde and sociable creature such as man is. In 
women the smoothnesse of their face is their proper ornament; they needed no ensigne of 
maiesty because they were borne to subiection. And Nature hath giuen them such a form 
of body as is answerable to the disposition of their minde. To conclude, the vse of hayre 
is diuers, according to the seuerall places where they are: as for example, the haire of the 
eye-browes serue for to receiue the humour falling downe from the head, and those of the 
eye-lids to direct the sight, and so of the rest. 
 
[}Of the Cuticle or Skarfe-skin. CHAP. V.}] 
 
THE first contayning or inuesting part, is the Cuticle, which the Greekes call 
Epidermis, because it runnes vppon the surface of the true skinne; whereof it 
is as it were a flowring or creamy production. For whilest Nature in the 
generation of the skin mingleth bloud with the seede, a moyst vapour of the 
[/100./] 
bloud foaming or frothing vp, and driuen forth by the strength of the heate, 
is condensed or thickned by the coldnesse of the ayre, and turned into the Cuticle or skarf-skin, 
for so I thinke wee may properly call it. And this is the reason why in Infants new-borne, 
[/101./] 
the whole skin looketh red, the Cuticle not being yet formed for want of cold ayre; 
or at least not sufficiently condensed, as it is after a short time; the aire thickning the cream 
or froth of the bloud, as wee see in gruell or boyling of paste or starch, a skin, filme or 
phlegme gathered together of the vaporous froth that ariseth from the thicke moysture 
which is by the cold ayre condensed. 
 
[^p.71^] 
This Skarfe-skinne is easily lost by attrition or scalding, and riseth apparently from the 
[/102./] 
skinne; it is likewise as easily recouered where the skin remayneth sound (for where there 
is no skin, but onely a scarre or cicatrice, there it will not growe againe) and therefore it is 
no spermaticall part, because if they perish, they cannot or very hardly againe be restored. 
[/103./] 
It is wondrous thin (vnlesse it growe Ca_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]lus or hard by continuall labour, as wee see it 
doth in Felt-makers) that it should not dull the sence of the skin vnder it: yet in the palmes 
of the hands, and soales of the feete, where it is continually worne and renued againe, it 
[/104./] 
is more crasse and thick. This is that which Serpents cast euery yeare, we call it the slough; 
men neuer, but vpon long sicknesse or poysons, or the vse of slabbering complexions. It 
[/105./] 
is thighter or more compact then the skin it selfe, whence it is, that those watery humours 
which are thrust out from the Center to the Circumference of the body, doe easily passe 
through the skin, but hang often in the Cuticle, and generate Echymata, Phlyctides, and 
[/106./] 
those many waterish Pustles which are called hydrea. It is altogether without bloud, because 
it receiueth neither veine nor arterie, so that it encreaseth rather by a kind of addition 
of matter, then by Nutrition. 
 
Insensible it is, that it might defend the skinne vnder it from externall iniuries; as also 
[/107./] 
attemper the exquisite sense of the same, and so becommeth medium tactus, the meane of 
touching. For sayth Aristotle, all sensation is made by some Meane, none by the immediat 
[/108./] 
touch of the obiect and the instrument. Hence it is that a man cannot see to reade vpon 
[/109./] 
a booke that is layd vpon his eye; because there wanteth the meane betweene the obiect 
and the instrument of sense, that is, ayre enlightned. In like manner when the Cuticle is off, 
we cannot distinguish between one Temper and another; because the very gentlest touch 
of the bared skin breedeth paine, and the sensation is confused, which is distinct when the 
skarfe-skin is whole. 
 
There is also another vse of it, to couer the open ends of the Capillarie or hairy veines 
which doe determine in the skin: for if the Cuticle be taken off, the skin vnder doth bleed. 
Moreouer it is also a couering to the skinne, that the moisture might not indecently on vnprofitably 
well or issue out at all times; for in a gall or rub, which is called Intertrigo in 
which the Cuticle is separated, the skinne is euer moyst. 
 
Lastly, it smootheth and polisheth the roughnesse and inequality of the skin, making it 
soft, supple and slicke, and so becommeth one of the greatest beauties that nature hath giuen 
to the body of man. That I cannot but wonder at Columbus, who vtterly forgot the manifold 
vses of this Cuticle. 
 
[}Of the Skinne. CHAP. VI.}] 
 
VNder this Curtain or Skarfe, lieth the true & genuine skin which the Greeks 
call [^GREEK OMITTED^], because it may bee excoriated or flayed off, so Hippocrates in his 
[/110./] 
booke de Arte: but in his book de insomnijs, [^GREEK OMITTED^]; and de victus ratione in acutis, 
[^GREEK OMITTED^]; and de ossiu~ Natura, [^GREEK OMITTED^] quasi [^GREEK OMITTED^] a band, because it compasseth 
and knitteth together the whole body; in Latine it is called Cutis. It hath 
a substance proper to it selfe, although it bee very like to a sinew and membrane, because it 
[/111./] 
is white, will stretch, and is of exquisite sence; but it is thicker then any membrane. It is ingendred 
of seede perfectly mixed with bloud, whence it commeth to passe that by it wee 
may iudge as well of the spermaticall as of the bloudy parts. It seemeth therefore to be of 
a middle nature betwixt flesh and a sinew, and so Vesalius conceiued it, not so abounding 
[/112./] 
with bloud as flesh, but as it were a bloudy sinew; so sayth Galen in his first booke de Temperam. 
[/113./] 
Notwithstanding in the composition the spermatical part exceedeth the sanguine, 
which appeareth as by the colour, so by this, that being wounded it is only reunited or conioyned 
by a cicatrice or scarre. Columbus thought it was bred of the extremities or ends of 
[/114./] 
the vessels dilated; Varolius, onely of the softer sinewes, which attayning to the surface of 
the body, doe there growe together into a couering, receiuing addition from the affluence 
of bloud; as the broade leaues of water Lillies arising from a slender stemme, when they 
appeare aboue the water, are extended into a great bredth out of a small stalke. Galen in 
the third of his Method, sayeth it is bred of the dryed and constringed or writhen flesh vnder 
it; and that is the reason why no hayres will grow vppon scarres, because they haue no 
foundation for them as the true skinne hath: but it should seeme that heerein Galen, and 
[/115./] 
not he only, but Plato and Aristotle were somewhat mistaken: for the skinne may be flayed 
[^p.72^] 
from the flesh vnder it, yea and betweene the skin and the flesh there are two partes (if at 
least they may be so called) the fat and the fleshy Membrane. 
 
The skin is naturally white, but according to the humours that abound, or the bodyes 
[/116./] 
vnder it, saith Hippocrates in his Booke de succis, it varieth in colour. For example: where 
blood aboundeth and the skin is thin as in the face, there a rosie rednesse mingleth it selfe 
with the white, or ouercommeth it, especially if eyther by heate or motion of the minde it 
flowe to the place more plentifully; and this blood when it is condensed or thickned by 
cold, maketh the skin looke liuid or blew. In Chollericke men the skin is pallid or yellowish: 
in Melancholy swarty and blackish or duskish, but if it bee defiled with vitiated Humors 
it becommeth yellow and black in the Iaundise and Morphew. 
 
It altereth also his colour, by reason of bodies vnder it; so where it adhereth or cleaueth 
to the flesh, as in the bals of the Cheekes and Palmes of the handes, it sooner becommeth 
red; if to the fat, it is whiter and smoother, especially where the fat is more plentifull; but 
when that fat is consumed, the skin becommeth wrinkled and looketh like a duskish shadow; 
as also it is liuid or blewish where the greater Veines are branched vnder it. Furthermore, 
the skin that it might be a kinde of muniment or defence is thicke, though not so 
thicke as in other creatures. It cannot without extreame paine bee separated from the 
flesh, because the extreamities or ends of the vessels do determine in it; whence some haue 
thought, that it proceedeth from those extreamities of the vessels dilated or spread into a 
superficies or smooth plainnesse. It is soft and of exquisite sense, by which it forewarneth 
the inward parts of the approaching euill before it ouertake them. 
 
According to the diuers vse of the parts, it is either softer and thinner, as in the face, the 
yard, and the scrotum or cod; or harder, as in the necke, the backe, the legs, and the soles 
[/117./] 
of the feete; some of it is in a middle temper betweene hard and soft, as in the palme of the 
hand, and especially in the fingers ends, because they are ordained to apprehend with; and 
beside in the skin of the hand, the power or sense of feeling was to be perfect, and therefore 
it behooued that it should bee voide of all excesse, and most temperate of all others; because 
that which is the iudge of feeling as all other Instruments, must be free from any forreigne 
or externall quality whereby the iudgement might be preiudiced: So some part of 
the skin is exceeding thicke, as in the head; some part onely thicke, as in the necke; some 
part thin, as in the sides and soales of the feete, which is the reason that there men are ticklish, 
some part yet thinner, as in the palme of the hand; and some thinnest of all, as in the 
lippes. 
 
It hath also a diuers connexion to diuers parts: for somewhere it may bee easily separated, 
as in the vpper and middle venter, the armes and the legges; otherwhere very hardly, 
[/118./] 
because of the fleshy Membrane to which it is tied by the mediation of certaine Fibres & 
vessels, betweene which and the saide Membrane, the fat where it is, so interposeth it selfe, 
that the skin may more easily be flayed from it: but from some parts it can hardly or not at 
all be separated, as from the soales of the feete, and the palmes of the hand, to which it is 
[/119./] 
immediately conioyned, that the apprehension of those parts may be more firme and stable. 
It is also very hardly separated from the flesh of the fore-head, & almost of the whole 
face, especially of the eares and lippes, because of Tendons and Muscles; especially that 
which they call the broad Muscle mingled therewith. Finally, in the forehead it is mooueable, 
[/120./] 
in the rest of the body (of a man I meane) immooueable, or for the most part: for in 
Beasts it is almost alwayes mooueable, and they say, an Elephant can by the corrugation 
or wrinkling of his skinne, kill the flies that molest him. 
 
It is an vnseamed garment couering the whole bodie, yet hath it certaine breaches made 
by Nature for her ease and reliefe, partly manifest, which are not many, and are called Foramina 
[/121./] 
or outlets; partly insensible, which are infinite, called pori, & of vs pores. Al which 
serue either for receyuing in or letting out, or both as neede shall require.
