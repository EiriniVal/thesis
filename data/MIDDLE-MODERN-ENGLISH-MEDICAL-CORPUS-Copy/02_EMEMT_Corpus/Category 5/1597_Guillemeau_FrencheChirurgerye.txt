HAvinge vvith my selfe resolved, 
[/1./] 
and purposed to discribe 
the operation of Chyrurgerye, 
first of all it seemed expedie~t 
vnto me to observe these 
three necessarye thinges. 
Namelye and especiallye, vvhat Chyrurgerye 
is. Secondlye, hovv and from vvhence, shee 
hath participatede and taken her originalle, 
and beginninge. Thirdlye vvhat the operatione 
of Chyrurgerye is. Concerninge therfore 
her beginninge & originalle, vnto all me~ 
is it apparent and vve rightvvell knovve, that 
the inventione, and findinge out of all artes, 
and scie~ces vvhatsoever, hath bin by all men 
in such greate estee~, and admiratione (vvhich 
Hippocrates in his boocke of auncie~te Physick 
vvitnesseth) that the inventors or aucthors of 
the same, have bin extolled even vnto the 
clovvdes, by the vvhich is vvitnessed, and testifyed, 
this inventione te have bin so perpolite, 
that it vvas adiudgede to be a thinge impossible 
to be discovered and brought into light, 
by anye other, the~ throughe some God, or at 
the least, by such a persone vvhich hath bin 
infused, vvith divine inspiratione: In soe 
much therfore, if this may be testyfyede of anye 
[/2./] 
artes vvith eqvitye and right, it may truelye 
and bouldlye be sayede of this arte of Chyrurgerye, 
the inventors, and aucthors of the 
vvhich, have bin canonisede, esteemede and 
extellod as Gods, as for example ther hath bin 
Apollo, Æsculapius, and Hippocrates, vvhoe have 
had divine honoure and reverence of all 
me~. The tvvo first of these aucthors, have allonelye 
leerned, that part of Physicke, vvhich 
through externalle medicame~tes, and by inscisions 
cured the infirmityes, and diseasses of 
mens bodyes. By the vvhich playnlye is to 
be vnderstoode and iudged, that Physicke at 
those times vvas not as then inve~ted created, 
or fovvnde out, vvhe~ that Chyrurgerye, vvas 
sufficie~tlye practised and knovvne in all places: 
the vvhich Homer testifyeth and vvitnesseth 
vnto vs in the seconde booke of his Iliades, 
vvhere he affirmeth that the sonns of Æsculapius, 
Podalyrus, and Machaon, in the besieginge 
of Troye have vvith ther handes handelede 
and cured manye and diuers vvou~ded 
perso~s vvithout molestinge or troublinge of 
themselves vvith anye internalle diseasses or 
sicknesses, as vvith agues, or vvith the plague, 
the vvhich notvvithstandinge prædominatede 
and vexede fore the vvhole hoste or campe 
of the Greeckes: and conseque~tlye Physick 
and the vse therof beinge knovvne, and in 
practise, Chirurgerye vvas verye confusedlye 
ha~deled amongste Physicke. But for asmuch 
that it is verye difficulte & a harde thinge to 
excell in divers, and sundrye artes, and because 
it is impossible, the vvorcke of Physicke, 
Chyrurgerye, and Apothecarye for one man 
to doe, therfore the arte of Chyrurgerye is secluded 
and separatede fro~ the other tvvo, havinge 
[^f.1v^] 
alsoe her ovvne professors and practitioners. 
The vvhich because that it may be-rightlye 
vnderstoode, it is to be noted and ob 
served, that in the oulde and auntient times, 
by Chyrurgerye, the thirde parte Therapeuticæ 
vvas not vnderstoode, even as vvee in 
these times take it, & as consequentlye shalbe 
[/3./] 
shevved: But they vnderstoode by this vvorde 
Chyrurgerye nothinge els, then that onlye, 
vvhich throughe the operatione of the 
ha~des is finishede and brought to passe vvher 
fore it is yet manifestlye vvritten by the auncie~t 
professors, that by Chyrurgians vvas nothinge 
else vnderstoode then certayne servantes, 
vvhich in those times vveare callede 
Chyrurgians, not because they had the perfecte 
science, or knovvledge of Chyrurgerye, 
but because they earned there sustenance and 
livinge through the vvorckinge of ther handes. 
Novv to conceave aright vvhat Chyrurgerye 
is, it is expedie~t and necessarye, that 
vve asce~de somvvhat higher, and industriouslye 
seerch & trye vvhat Physicke is seinge manifestlye 
that Chyrurgerye is therof seperated 
and secluded. 
 
[/4./] 
Physick therfore is nothinge else (as Hippocrates 
in his booke De arte vvitnessethe) then a 
knovvledge, or science, vvhich teacheth, hovv 
to cure anye sicknesses to frustraete, and annihilaete 
there impregnable forces, because of 
themselves they are incurable. 
 
This Physicke agayne hath sundrye partes, 
[/5./] 
of the vvhich the first is Physiologia, vvhich 
handelethe and treatethe, of the structure and 
situatione of mans bodye, vvherin is to be regarded 
and noted on the seaven vnnaturalle 
thinges. The seco~de is Hygiena, that is a Nource, 
and fosterer, or præserver, of our health, 
vvhich instructeth, hovv vve shovvlde continuallye 
preserve our presente health, & keepe 
the sovvnde bodye liber, and free from all diseasses, 
& sicknesses: and this consistethe in sixe 
vnnaturalle thinges. The thirde is Pathologia, 
vvhich treatethe of the cause, and occasione of 
the sicknesses & of the accidentes vnto the same, 
the vvhich three thinges are agaynste nature. 
The fourth is called, Simiotica, and treateth 
of the demo~stratinge signes of toke~s, not 
onlye of that vvhich is all readye passed, but 
alsoe of that vvhich is as yet to come, in respecte 
as vvel of sicknesse, as of health. The fifth is 
Therapeutica, that is the curinge or sanable parte 
of Physicke, vvhich instructeth, & learneth, 
hovve to repelle and cure sicknesses, and diseases, 
& restore agayne to former health: This 
[/6./] 
prænominated Therapeutica is redivided and 
agayne dealed in three partes, the first vvherof 
is called, Dietetica, vvhich teacheth, hovv to observe 
a sober & good diete: The seco~de parte, 
Pharmacia, vvhich instructed vs, hovv to compovvnde 
our medicaments. And the third 
part is callede Chirurgia, vvhich cureth or helpethe 
the affected patients through manualle 
or handlye operation for Chirurgia hath his 
derivatione of a Greecke vvorde, and is compovvnded 
of Cheir vvhich signifyeth a ha~de, 
and Ergo~ vvhich betokeneth operatione: nether 
may vve by this vvorde Chirurgia not on 
lye vnderstande, all operations vvhich are onlye 
effected by the handes, but most of all and 
especiallye, all that is done, or may be done one 
mans bodye tovvarde the curinge of all externall 
diseases. 
 
And as co~cerninge this vvorde operatione, 
[/7./] 
it is nothing else, then an artificialle and normaticke 
applicatione, vvhich is brought to 
passe, and vvrought by the handes, one mans 
bodye, vvhervvith the decayed health is reiterated, 
and agayne restored. And if vve vveare 
desirous to knovve vvhat the office, & dutye 
of a true chyrurgiane is, or vvhat his operations 
are, hovv and in vvhat manner he must 
vvorke, & effecte them, and vvhat conditions 
are expected, at a chyrurgians ha~des, I have discribed 
them fullye, & at large in my generall 
table, and discriptione of Chirurgerye, vvherfore 
I vvil make in this place noe more me~tione 
of them. 
 
[}Of the prognostication or iudgement of 
woundes Chap. 2.}] 
 
IT is certayne that the prædictione, 
[/8./] 
or iudgeme~t of vvou~des, 
yea alsoe the generalle knovvledge 
of all disseases, is a thinge 
most necessarye and expedient 
for a good Chyrurgiane: therfore 
Hippocrates alsoe estemed it verye conveniente, 
& profitable, that a Chyrurgiane must 
excelle in the fore knovvledge of thinges, and 
be apt & redye to give iudgement and his opinione 
of all disseases, because by that he may 
attayne, and at chiue vnto greate credite, and 
fidelitye by all men, and havinge on this manner 
set forth, and published his knovvledge 
shalbe irrepræhendable, and of all men admired, 
& soe much the safer, &, vvith more providence 
finis he his vvorcke, & the boulder illustraete 
the operatione of his arte, and give 
iudgement ther of vvithout anye scoffe, or 
checke, and be able to give a true reporte, 
vvhen that by the aucthoritye of some learnede 
chyrurgiane, or by the aucthorytye of some 
Potentate, he shalbe therin imployede, & 
ordayned to reporte his opinione, ether of the 
vvounded persons life, ordeath, haultnes or 
criplenes. Even as alsoe the foresayd Hippocrates 
[^f.2r^] 
sayeth in his Porrhet that the Chirurgiane 
[/9./] 
must ende voure him selfe to have a vvise 
& grave gesture, because that if it soe chaunce 
as he adiudged it shoulde, he might reape honoure, 
& goodvvil, not onlye of the patient, 
but alsoo of all the circumstants, and behoulders: 
Contrarilye if that othervvyse it happened 
or chaunced then he sayed, and iudged it 
shoulde, and that his iudgemente fayle him, 
he shal not onlye of all me~ be hated but alsoe 
be esteemed as an ignorant, & sottishe fellovve. 
Beyonde all this Galenus sayeth, and testifyeth 
vnto vs, that by our vpright, and sincere 
iudgement, by the frendes & Kindrede of the 
patie~te, althoughe he come to dye, vve shalbe 
liberated, & freede from all badde reportes & 
sclaunders, because that throughe the death 
vvhich consequentlye follovved, nothinge 
shalbe alleagede agaynst vs. 
 
And for the givinge of such a perfect, and 
[/10./] 
complete iudgement; it is necessarye for the 
chyrurgiane not to be ignora~t, vvhich partes 
of the bodye beinge vvounded, easylye, or difficultlye 
may be cured, vvhich of the~ are present 
death, and in fine, the tokens hovv to 
knovve vvhat partes are vvounded or hurte, 
because that out of ther natures, quallityes, & 
dispositio~s, vve may certaynlye hope, or mistruste 
of theire health, and safetye. 
 
Such iudgemente therfore ought to be taken, 
out of the verye beinge, and substance, or 
essence of the vvou~ded parte, alsoe of the vse, 
the actione, and situatione of the same, there 
must alsoe be noted, the proportione, and figure 
of the same vvounde, and the accidentes 
or other chaunces, vvhich are incident vnto 
her, consideringe alsoe the complexione and 
temperature of the bodye, the sexe, the age, on 
his handelinge, the the trafiqve, ma~ner of livinge, 
the contrye, the constitutione of the time 
then præsent, and one the time and season of 
the yeare. 
 
To conclude, all men that have receaved a 
[/11./] 
greate vvou~de, are ether in daunger of death 
or in daunger of beinge mutilate. VVe eesteme 
and accounte the vvounde to be large, for 
[/12./] 
thre occasions: The firste vvherof is, because 
that through her latitude, or vvidnesse, & circumiacente 
places shee hath a threefoulde 
survayinge and measuringe to vvit, in length, 
bredthe, and debthe, as some there are vvhich 
be deepe & broadlye carvede: or right overthvvarte 
or crosse vvyse vvholye perci~ge throughe 
the principalle muscles of anye parte, by 
the vvhich alsoe somtimes the bones are hevved 
& cutte quite through, & broken, vvher 
fore some times they must be stitchte, bound 
and ligated together: or because that the vaynes, 
the arteryes, or the sinneus themselves, 
come to be squised and plettered. The seco~de, 
co~cerninge the vvorthynes of the vvounded 
parte, for although the vvounde be but 
little, in her meatinge yet notvvithstandinge 
vve esteeme her to be greate, because that the 
strengthe and actione, of the vvounded parte 
or member, is verye necessarye for the vvhole 
bodye and for the vvhole lyfe of man, vvhich 
parte havinge lefte his naturall vse and actione, 
it consequentlye follovveth that the personne, 
must immediatly discease & dye, as vve 
may by experience see that daylye chaunceth 
in the vvoundes of the Braynes, of the Harte, 
and in the vvoundes of the Liver. 
 
Thirdelye, because that some vvoundes are 
of a vvorser nature, & dispositione, as beinge 
venoumede, rebellious, and entermingled 
vvith some badde and dolorous accidentes, 
vvhich sometimes farre surpasse & excell the 
vvounde it selfe, as it is evidentlye & planlye 
to be seene in the vvoundes of the Ioynctes, 
vvhich immediatlye, may fall into a verye exceedinge 
badde estate, because that those partes 
and places are circumligatede or clothed 
vvith verye smalle store of fleshe, beinge onlye 
decked & coverede vvith the Tendones, 
vvith sinnues, vvith Ligaments, & that verye 
tender, and sensible pellicle Periostium, by the 
vvhich these partes or members are in more 
daunger of fallinge into a convulsione of sinnues, 
into Phrensye, payne, and inquietude, 
as much as a farre more greater vvounde in anye 
other parte of the bodye. 
 
Those vvoundes are accounted incurable 
[/13./] 
vvhich doe happen in the Braynes, or in the 
ventricle of the same, in the Harte, entra~ce of 
the stomacke, in the Vena Cava, the entra~ce of 
the Liver, the backe bone, quite throughe the 
Lunges, in the small guttes, or entralles, the 
stomacke, the Kidnies, or in anye greate vaynes, 
or arteryes about the throate. But these 
[/14./] 
vvou~des vvhich vvil difficultlye be curede are 
they by the vvhich the Longes, the Liver, the 
me~brane of the Brayns the Milte, the Matrix, 
or vvombe, the blather, anye of the greate 
guttes, or the Middelriefe, are vvou~ded vvith 
verye small vvounde. Alsoe are those vvou~des 
[/15./] 
daungerous, vvheras the greate vaynes, & 
Arteryes, vnder the Emunctoria or arme pittes, 
& in the Hockes or be~dinge of the knees are 
vvounded: and indeed all vvoundes are suspitious, 
in all places vvheraboute anye greate 
Vaynes, or Arteryes are situated & placed, because 
that throughe theire effusione of bloede, 
the vvounded persone is berefte of all his 
abilitye & forces: the vvoundes of the Secrete 
partes or privityes, and the vvoundes of the 
Testicles are alsoe by this reasone verye perillous 
& daungerous, as alsoe are these vvhich 
happen and chaunce to light betvveene the 
fingers. 
 
[^f.2v^] 
There is alsoe greate heede to be taken one 
[/16./] 
the manner & forme of the vvou~de: for those 
vvou~des vvhich chaunce, or come by crushinge, 
or pletteringe, are farre vvorse, then those, 
vvhich are onlye hevvede, so that it is much 
better to be vvou~ded vvith a sharpe edgede or 
cuttinge svvorde, the~ vvith anye other blunte 
vveapone vvhich is not sharpe. 
 
The rounde or circle vvoundes are vvorste 
& difficultest to be curede, but the certayneste 
& easyeste to be cured, are those vvhich passe 
by the le~ngth of the fibres right like a linye or 
line. 
 
The vvoundes of the Hippe, vvich are receaved 
in the membranous muscle, are verye 
[/17./] 
exceedinge daungerous, & especiallye if it be 
a thruste or stabbe, or else vvhe~ the apertione 
of the same is verye smalle, & hath noe issue, 
but it is soe much the vvorse if it soe chaunce 
ther be anye fracture or separatione of bones, 
it be vvhere it vvil in anye place of the hippe: 
& so farre forthe as if the vvounde be in anye 
internalle parte of the Hippe, about the greate 
vaynes, then the vvounde is passinge & exceedinge 
daungerous, for there ensuethe out of 
ha~de some greate inflammatione there vnto, 
& conseque~tlye thereafter a Gangræna, or mortificatione: 
he that happeneth to receave a 
vvounde in the foremoste parte of his arme, is 
alsoe subiecte vnto the same daunger of inflammatione, 
and mortificatione, and causeth 
great payne & trouble, because that those 
vvoundes most commonlye are præsente 
deathe. 
 
Novv as much as belongeth vnto the judgemente 
[/18./] 
& opinione, vvhich is to be considered 
& noted out of the accidentes of all vvou~des, 
Hippocrates teaceth vs: in somuch as in the 
greate & badde vvoundes, as are the vvoundes 
of the Sinues, of the Te~dones, of the Ioynctes, 
& of the bones, little or noe svvellinge or inflammatione 
at all apperareth, & illustratethe 
it selfe it is a verye evell and badde signe, for 
vvhye, it signifyethe vnto vs that those humors 
vvhich consideringe the payne shoulde 
have assembled, & packed the~selves that vvaye 
& have circumcinglede themselves rovvnde 
aboute the vvou~ded parte, have retracted the~selves 
into some principalle & especiall parte 
of the bodye. 
 
[/19./] 
Those vvoundes in the vvhich there appearethe 
anye svvellinge, or tumefactione verye 
selden or never fall into any Phrensye, or into 
co~vulsione of Sinnues, because that the venomous 
humors, vvhich might, ascende & dravve 
tovvarde the Braynes or into the sinuishe 
partes of the boddye, have congregate and gatherede 
the~selves together aboute the vvounde: 
but if that one the suddayne the svvellinge 
vvithout anye evidente reason, as in example, 
in the applyinge of anye remedyes, throughe 
purgations, or throughe phlebotomisinge or 
bloode lettinge, came to departe & vvith dravve 
it selfe into some other place and that in 
such, as are vvounded behinde in there backe 
bone, that persone is troubled vvith convulsione 
of synnues, through the vvith dravvinge 
of the matter, into the sinnuishe partes of the 
backebone: and the vvounde beinge in the foremost 
partes of the bodye, and the matter of 
the svvellinge, asce~dinge vpvvardes, throughe 
the greate vaynes, tovvarde the Braynes, the 
patient strayghtvvay fallethe into a madnesse 
& Phrenesye: or if soe be that the matter dravve 
tovvarde the breste, then ther ensue greate 
& intollerable stitches, or Apostemations, 
because that those badde humors cano not by 
anye meanes possible be consumed or vvastede, 
but descende & sincke dovvne into the co~cavitye 
of the breste. And if that the svvellinge 
novv departinge be of a verye highe & redde 
colloured, & that thervvas store of bloode 
therin, vvhich is descended & suncke dovvne 
tovvarde the guttes, then it necessarylye & co~sequentlye 
fellovveth that the patiente falleth 
into the Blodye flyxe, or Dysenterye. 
 
As farre forthe therfore as there procedethe 
[/20./] 
anye convulsione of synnues out of a vvounde, 
& especiallye from anye greate inflammatione, 
that is a signe of deathe, for therbye vve 
may playnlye, note, & marke that the synnuishe 
partes of the bodye, must needes be hurte, 
and that the Braynes are in some, or other passione. 
 
If that into anye vvou~des, vvhich have fiercelye 
bledde anye Spasmus happen, that is a bad 
signe. 
 
All thrustes of the sinnues, and Tendones, 
[/21./] 
are verye daungerous, and especiallye, vvhen 
as the skinne and the fleshe chaunce to shutt 
together, for therin engenderethe a sharpe & 
corrodinge matter, vvhich resuscitatethe and 
causethe greate & intollerable payne, because 
she can not by anye meannes get issue, out of 
the vvhich procedethe & follovvethe convulsione 
of synnues, inflammatione, and a Gangræne, 
or mortificatione. In soo much as anye 
[/22./] 
especiall and principalle, or Organicke 
parte, or anye instrumentalle parte, totallye & 
vvholye is hevved of, and sequestred and separatede 
from the bodye, it can not by anye meanes 
be restored and cured, because that the 
blode, and the vitalle Spirites are vvholye exhalated, 
throughe the greate vaynes, vvhich 
are cleane a sunder, and that by the vvhich the 
cure must be done, and the foregoinge health 
agayne restorede. 
 
The temperature of the boddye, the time 
of the yeare, the age the handlinge and trafique, 
and the manner of the patients livinge, 
[^f.3r^] 
the knovvledge of the co~trye are a greate helpe 
& ayde for the prognosticatione of vvoundes: 
a childe, or a yongema~, vvhich as yet is in-his 
grovvth vvil better and vvith more ease be 
healed or curede, then an aged personne: and 
a stronge ma~, a greate deale sooner then a feeble, 
and debile person. A leane and sclender 
persone, vvilbe curede vvith more facilitye, 
then a thicke, and grosse lived man. And a 
sounde bodye farre sooner, then a sicke and 
corrupte bodye. That man vvhich laboureth, 
easier, then a stillsittinge and idle persone. 
A soberman, farre sooner, then a bancketter, 
and one that haunte the hoores. The 
most conveniente time of the yeare, to cure & 
heale a vvou~de, is in the fore summere or Vernall 
time of the yeare, or at the least in such a 
time, in the vvhich it is nether to hotte nor 
to coulde, because that extreame heate, or extreame 
coulde, are the enymyes of all vvoundes, 
and especiallye the changinge of heate, & 
of coulde, vvherfore alsoe the fore vvinter or 
Autu~nus, is verye vnprofitable for the same. 
[/23./] 
In some regions and countryes, the vvoundes 
are ether easyer, or difficulter to becurede: for 
at Rome, the vvoundes of the heade are difficulter 
to be curede, then the vvoundes of the 
Legges, the vvhich notvvithstandinge at Avignon 
vve finde cleane contrarye. 
 
As farre as the vvounded person keepe and 
continue his perfecte Sence, and memorye 
nether gettethe anye agues, vve may then assure 
our selves, that the vvounde vvil quicklye 
and easylye be curede, VVe ought 
not therfore to discourage the patiente, althoughe, 
he have an ague by the greate vvou~de, 
as longe as the inflammatione is yet before 
hande, and as longe as there engenderethe 
anye matter. But an ague is verye daungerous, 
[/24./] 
vvhe~ she issuethe from a small vvounde 
and especiallye, vvhen she hath longe continuance, 
after the inflammatione, and supuratione, 
or vvhen she incitateth the patient vnto 
Phrenesye. VVhen the patient parbrakethe 
against his vvil, greene galle, or immediatlye 
vvhen he hath receaved the blovve, or 
at the time vvhile the inflammatione is as yet 
duringe, that is alsoe a badde signe, especiallye 
in these vvhich are vvounded in a synnue, or 
in annye sinnuishe place: But the parbrakinge, 
or vomitinge, vvhich commeth by the fre 
vvil of the patiente, is nothinge suspicious, especiallye 
in those, vvhich are vsed to vomitinge, 
if that a man præsentlye after meales, or after 
that the inflammatione is come, or the 
[/25./] 
vvoun~de being in the heade, doe not come to 
vomite. The Chyrurgiane must vse greate 
foresight, in givinge iudgeme~t of the vvoundes 
of the Heade, for the aunciente Chyrurgians, 
have alvvayes esteemed the~ doubtfulle 
& suspect, because of other badde accidentes 
vntil the Fifteenth day, and the moderne 
and, ionge professors, vntill the hundredthe 
day. 
 
The Iurists, or lavvyers, have constituted 
and ordayned fifteene dayes, for the iudgement 
of the vvoundes of the Heade, to knovve 
of a certayntye, vvhether the patient by 
occasione of that vvou~de came to dye or not 
or by reasone of his ovvne faulte, or by any 
other occasione. Because therfore, that the 
yonger Chyrurgiane, shall not be over rashe, 
in givinge of his iudgement, leaste he come 
te glyde and falle into anye badde reportes, 
or in anye repræhensione. As much as 
appartayneth vnto me, I have knovvne some, 
vvhich have continued in a verye good 
estate, vnto the thirteenth, fourteenth, or vntill 
the fifteenth day, and then have fallen into 
agues, and manye other accidentes, by the 
vvhich they in the end chau~ced to dye. VVee 
must alsoe note, that all naughtye and badde, 
accidents most of all publishe themselves, at 
the full Moone, more then at other times, because 
as then all maner of moysture grovveth 
and increaseth more, then in the decreasinge 
of the Moone, & alsoe more in the sommer, 
then in the VVinter. 
 
The signes and tokens of the deadlye fractures 
[/26./] 
of the sculle, are agues in the VVinter, 
before the fourteenthe daye, and in the sommer 
before the seaventhe day: Item, a naughtye 
and badde colloure of the vvounde: little 
matter of the same: mortificatioue of that 
vvhich is inflamed: slimye or viscouse consistence 
of that vvhich is corrupted: drieth ariditye 
in the skinne of the heade, as it is in a 
peece of pouldrede fleshe, vvith a brouvvne, 
leadishe, and blacke colloure, vvhich signifyeth 
the beginninge of the corruptinge and 
putrifyinge of the sculle, vvhich the~ vvaxeth 
ravve, as vve may see, vvhen it is rotten, and 
grovvne blacke: vvheras before it vvas even 
and smoothe. Finallye vve see therin, a pale, 
and yellovvishe colloure, to vvitt vvhen 
the foresayede bone is vvholye corrupted & 
rotten, throughe the purulent matter, vvhich 
vvas suncke to the grovvnde of the vvounde, 
and vvas there gathered together. 
 
The patient beginneth to rage, he hath 
little pimples one his tonge, he getteth alsoe 
convulsione of synnues, one the contrarye 
syde of the vvounde: some fal inte an Apoplexia 
vvheron follevvethe deathe. The 
Practitioners of our times, have observed in 
all vvoundes, vvhether allreadye therin vveare 
a Paralisis, or els theafter happened thervnto: 
and one the contrarye syde a Convulsione, 
[^f.3v^] 
or somtimes also in the vvounded part a 
Convulsione, and in the other syde a Paralisis, 
sometimes also in both the partes, ether a Co~vulsione, 
or Paralisis, and somtimes one each 
syde ether a Convulsione, or a Paralisis, vvithout 
the contrarye syde beinge in anye sorte 
thervvith infected. The goode signes of healinge, 
in the fractures of the Heade, after that 
it is trepanede, or els after that the broke~ parcells 
of bones, are taken out of the Heade, are 
these namelye vvhen that the Membrane of 
the Braynes hath her naturalle colloure, and 
her naturalle motione & stirringe: vvhen the 
engendringe and grovvinge Fleshe is redde. 
VVhen that the patient may easylye turne aboute 
his Necke, and alsoe easylye vvagge his 
lovver chavve bone. But in somuch as the 
Membrana hath noe stirringe, and is blacke, leadish 
[/27./] 
colourede, & lividouse or vvith anye other 
badde coloure taynted & defylede: Then 
the patient ragethe, vomiteth exceedinglye, 
falleth into a Paralysis, or in Spasmo, if that the 
Fleshe of the vvounde be leadishe colourede 
the necke & the chavvebone bothe of the~ sta~d 
stiffe all these are verye bad signes. And vvhe~ 
the vvoo~de, is at a good estate, the~ beginneth 
the fleshe of the Membrane, or of the sculle 
to grovve, and to vvax dubble, and filleth all 
the voyde places vvith fleshe, that have binne 
open betvveene the bones, yea & somtimes 
covereth even as it vveare vvith pomgranate 
Kernells the scull it selfe. 
 
[}The tokens howe to knowe which partes of the 
bodye are wounded Cap, 3.}] 
 
TTe vvoundes most commonlye 
are knovven by ther first 
aspecte, alsoe sometimes the 
place of the vvou~de certifyeth 
vnto vs, vvhat partes are internallye 
vvounded: But seinge 
that it of ten times chauncethe, that these 
vvoundes, vvhich to our estimatione be not 
profounde or deepe, penetrate vnto the internall 
partes, vve vvil heere therfore recite the 
signes, by the vvhich vve may knovve, vvhat 
internall partes, vvithin the bodye are vvou~ded, 
because ther by vve may knovve, vvhether 
the patie~te may be cured of them or not. 
 
If soe be that the Braynes or else ther Membrane 
[/28./] 
is vvou~ded, the~ ther issueth bloode out 
of ther Noses, vvith some alsoe out at there 
Eares & commonlye ther follovveth a vomitinge 
of choler: some lye almoste out of the 
memorye & beside the~selves that althoughe 
you call & crye vnto them, they give noe ansvvere: 
others see~ in ther faces as if they vveare 
afrighted & feared: some turne and vvinde 
there eyes, this vvay and that vvaye, as if they 
vveare touched & stricken by Gods ha~de, the 
thirde or the fifth daye most commo~lye they 
fall into madnes & Phrenesie: other gette the 
Spasmu~, before they dye: some there are vvhich 
plucke the medicame~tes from there Heades, 
soe that the vvounde commeth to lye bare, & 
vvaxeth coulde. 
 
VVhe~ as the backe bone is hurte, or vvou~ded, 
[/29./] 
the~ beginnethe the patie~t to be feeble & 
lame in his synues, or else he getteth co~vulsione 
of synues, vvhich is called Spasmus: leeseth 
the sence of feelinge, somtimes the patie~t can 
nether retayne his vrine, Sperma, or Stole, but 
of it selfe departeth from him. 
 
If the Harte be vvou~ded, ther issueth out of 
[/30./] 
the vvounde, greate store of blacke, dence, or 
thicke bloode, & especiallye vvhen the right 
side of the Harte is hurte: But vvhen the left 
syde of the Harte is hurte, then issuethe out of 
the vvounde fine & subtile redde bloode the 
pulse of the patie~t is verye debile & feeble, & 
variable, & is verye pale coloured in his face: 
The coulde svveate in all his bodye bursteth 
out, and hath a verye vnsaverye smelle, eve~ as 
vve may note in other sicknesses of longe co~tinuance. 
His handes and feete beginne to be 
coulde, out of the vvhich present death ensueth. 
 
VVhe~ the Lunges are hurte, the~ breatheth 
[/31./] 
the patie~t vvith greate difficvltye, & divers times 
reiterateth, & dravveth anevve his breath 
as if he there by sought & indevoured to doe 
him selfe som solace & co~forte: he voydeth of 
ten times through his mouth frothye bloode, 
& throughe the vvou~de fayre, redde, & vitalle 
bloode, vvith peepinge & hissinge breathe: he 
endevoureth for the most parte to lye one his 
vvou~ded syde: others often times erecte them 
in ther bed vvith out anye occasione: Some 
lyinge one the vvounded syde, can speeke, but 
turninge the~selves one ther sovvnde syde are 
quite deprived of there speeche: sometimis 
they are bloesinge in ther faces, & sometime 
cleane pale, and at the last issueth out of the 
mouth of the vvounde greate quantitye of filthye 
matter, 
 
The signes of a vvounded Liver are these; 
[/32./] 
na~lye that out of there right syde they avoyde 
a greate qua~titye of bloode: Both sydes of the 
bodye, are as it vveare plucked tovvarde the 
backe bone: The patie~t is verye pale in his face 
as if he vveare halfe deade: His eyes are fallen 
invvardes, and hath intollerable payne, 
beinge ignorant throughe his impatientie 
vvhat he shal doe: he ist best at ease vvhen 
he lye thone his bellye: he hath a verye 
prickinge & stinginge payne, vvhich dravveth 
tovvarde his breste, and also toevvarde the sydes 
of the same. Heavinge and contractinge 
his shoulders togeather must he breathe, and 
[^f.4r^] 
somtimes throughe, parbraking he avoydethe 
choller. Hath a verye violent, & fervent 
pulse, he is easylye ince~sed to ire, & sorrovve: 
somtimes he hath an ashe coloured face, his 
vrine alsoe so~tymes verye bloodye: his stoels 
like matter, and dye most co~monlye, vvith the 
Hickcoughe. 
 
VVhe~ the kidnyes are hurte, then desce~deth 
& as it vveare by gedrees co~methe the payne 
[/33./] 
into the flanckes, and soe forvvarde vnto the 
testicles: the patient can verye difficultlye be 
released of his vrine, he pisseth bloode, or at 
the least his vvater is bloodye. Somtimes his 
vrine is quite retaynede, by the vvhich occasione, 
the patie~te beinge extreamlye svvollene 
dieth. 
 
[/34./] 
If the Milte be hurte or vvounded, then the 
bloode issueth out of the left syde of the pacie~te, 
& is blak of coloure. The same syde, & alsoe 
the stomacke beginne tobe indurated, & harde: 
the patie~t vvaxeth thirstye & the payne retracteth 
it selfe tovvardes the breste, as in the 
vvoundes of the Liver. 
 
Novv the VVombe beinge hurte, the vvoma~ 
[/35./] 
hathe greate payne in her flanckes, in her 
Haunches, & in her hippes: she avoydeth bloode 
partlye throughe the vvounde, and partlye 
throughe her privityes, after the vvhich somtimes 
follovveth a parbrakinge of Cholera Others 
ca~ not speake: some lye out of memorye 
others vvhich doe not rage, say that they are 
troubled vvith greate payne in there sinnues, 
& in ther Eyes: & vvhen they dravve tovvarde 
deathe, they are troubled vvith the same accide~tes, 
vvhich vve have recited of the Harte. 
 
VVhen the middle reefe or Diaphragma is 
[/36./] 
vvou~ded, the~ are the sydes of the patie~t dravvne, 
& shruncke vpvvardes: they have exceedinge 
greate & violent payne, internallye in 
the backe bone: they have verye retardate breathe, 
and there issueth out of the vvounde frothye 
bloode. 
 
The entrance of the stomacke beinge hurte 
[/37./] 
the patiente beginnethe to have the hickvp, & 
avoydeth choller: vvhen as he eateth or dricketh, 
he casteth it strayghte vvay fro~ him agayne: 
he hath a smalle, feeble, & obscure pulse: 
he getteth a little coulde svveate, vvith a coolinge 
of all externalle partes. 
 
The stomacke, & that gutte Ieiunum, have 
[/38./] 
hoth of them one manner of token, because 
that there meate & drincke issueth out of the 
mouth of the vvounde somtimes beinge halfe 
digested, and altered in Chylum: they feele a 
payne, as if a man vvoulde rente & teare there 
Harte out of there bodyes: they gett hardnesse 
in ther sydes, so~times alsoe parbraketh the patient 
Cholera, vpvvards throughe the mouth, 
& his spittle is bloodye: betveen these tvvo is 
noe other difference, then that the gutt Ieiunu~ 
hath his place & situatione somvvhat lovver 
then the stomacke. 
 
The bladder bei~ge hurte, vve feele payne, in 
[/39./] 
the flanckes: that parte of his bellye a little aboue 
his privityes extendethe & stretchete it 
selfe: in steade of vrine the patie~t pisseth bloode, 
or else the vrine issueth forthe of the vvou~de: 
the entrance of the stomacke is perturbed 
& out of ordre, vvherfore the vvounded vomite 
Cholera, or at the least are afflicted vvith 
the hick cough: they beginne to vvax coulde 
in handes & feete, and consequentlye ensueth 
death. 
 
[}Instructione, how to give a certayne reporte of 
all woundes what soever before the magistrates. 
Cap. 4.}] 
 
[/40./] 
ALl such vvhich before anye 
magistrates, of anye vvou~ded 
or sicke personne, vvil & are 
disposed to give reporte & instructione, 
shallby noe meanes intrude them selfves, before 
that of the magistraete they shalbe requested 
therto, & sent for, seinge that most commonlye 
proferede vvitnesse is repræhe~dable: 
& he that taketh such a thinge in hande ought 
first of all to visite and see the patient, because 
he might ripelye and dillige~tlye consider of al 
thinges, namelye & especiallye one the greatnes 
of the dissease, one the situatione, & place 
of the same, not onlye, as the~ may give good 
instructione, but alsoe, one all occasio~s, & on 
the prædictione & fore sayinge of the vvoundes, 
vvithout havinge vnadvisedlye therin hasted 
him selfe: for it is a harde and difficulte 
matter, to give a perfecte & co~plet iudgement 
of the end of all vvou~des, or other sicke perso~nes, 
because of the accidentes vvhich might 
chaunce thervnto, for those vvou~des, vvhich 
vve doe not esteeme of so~times are occasione 
of death, & co~trarylye those of the vvhich vve 
expected nothinge but death, are yet notvvithstandinge 
cured. VVe knovve, that some ther 
are cured & healed, notvvithstandinge althoughe 
they vveare vvounded in the Membrane 
or pellicle of the Braynes yea & some vvhich 
vveare hevvede in the substa~ce of there Braynes: 
as I alsoe remember some to have bin 
cured, vvhich vveare hurte in the luges, in the 
Middlereefe, in the Liver, in the smalle guttes 
or e~tralles, the Bladder, the Kidnyes, or in the 
Matrix or vvombe. Althoughe vve accordinge 
to the iudgeme~t & reason of the aunciente 
professors, esteeme such vvoundes to be deadlye 
& incurable. Contrarylye vve se some me~ 
men dye of smalle and vndiepe vvoundes: vve 
must therfore in such thinges make a distinction 
amonge the vvounded for some ther 
are vvhich are of soo goode a temperature, 
[^f.4v^] 
and state of bodye, that of a greate and large 
vvounde vvhich in anye other mans bodye 
vvear præsent deathe, they are cured: contralye 
there are others vvhich beinge vvounded 
in anye externalle partes, vvhich are nothinge 
noce~te or dau~gerous to the lyfe of the patient, 
vvithout anye penetratione, of the 
vvhich, notvvithstandinge they chaunce to 
dye, ether of the badde co~stellatione, or constitutione 
of the time, or by the refluxione of 
anye badd humors vnto the vvounded parte. 
 
Althoughe therfore, that some vvoundes 
[/41./] 
are curable, and alsoe of a good constitutio~& 
dispositione, vvithout anye badde or co~trarye 
signe therin to be marked, but for all that vve 
may not give anye absolute iudgement or reporte 
of the same, but muste onlye say that 
the vvounde is curable, soe farre forth as there 
be nothinge prætermittede, vvhich consisteth 
and belongeth as vvell in the patient as 
vnto the Chyrurgiane vvhich hathe him inhandes, 
it belongeth alsoe vnto the circu~stantes, 
and vnto other externall thinges. 
 
VVe must thefore suspe~de our iudgeme~t, 
[/42./] 
and keepe it in secrete for a season, vvithout 
givinge anye absolute reporte the first daye, 
because that the good or badde signes ca~ not 
soe sone reveale and disclose themselves: vve 
must alsoe co~sider that all vvoundes must have 
ther originalle, ther increasinge, and there 
estate, and duringe this time, seeke by all meanes 
possible to represse the vntemperatenes, 
vvhich is fallen into the vvounded parte, 
throughe the blovve, throughe the external 
ayre, vvhich striveth vvith nature, agaynst 
the vvhich nature strengthenethe and fortyfyeth 
her selfe, to expell and drive avvay the 
foresayed vntemperatenesse, duringe the 
vvhich time, vve can not certaynlye knovve, 
vvhich of the~ shall obtayne the victorye, the~ 
onlye some time therafter, vvhenas the foresayed 
vntemperatenesse maketh her selfe 
knovvne, throughe anye signes vvhich shee 
revealeth in the concurringhe humors because 
nature, throughe certayne sygnes, doth 
demonstrate that shee hath obtayned victorye, 
and is become the mistresse of that vnte~peratenesse. 
These signes and toke~s are especiallye 
knovvne, by the matter afore ha~d: and 
because that the purulence or matter, is not 
engendred the first daye, it necessarilye follovveth 
that on the first daye, vve give not anye 
absolute reporte of a vvounde, but must first 
consider, vvhether it is bent, because that nature 
one the dayes of Crisis demonstrateth her 
selfe, by the vvhich vve may iudge of the end 
of the sicknes. The first, and certanest daye 
of the Crisis is, the seventhe, for the fourth, is 
not indeede the day of the Crisis, but vvel the 
demonstratinge day of the seaventh, vvhich 
is the vpright and trevve day of the Crisis. After 
the seventh, follovvethe the eleventh, of 
the vvhich the seaventh is the demonstratinge 
daye, then the fourteenth daye follovveth, 
after that the tvventithe, and then the last is 
the fortithe: For if that before the fortith 
daye, vve perceave noe badd signes, it is then 
evide~t and playne enoughe, that the vvounde 
vvilbe easylye cured. 
 
It is best therfore that vve doe not reporte 
[/43./] 
or give anye iudgement before the seaventh 
day be passed by, in vvhich time, the accide~tes 
beginne to reveale the~selves vvher on as the~ 
vve must have a specialle regarde and care, 
vvhether ther be more good, then badde accide~tes 
afore ha~des, or the contrarye, vve must 
consider one these signes, three manner of 
vvayes: For they reveale themselves ether in 
the qualitye of the bodye, of the vvounded 
parte, or in the livinge, and vitalle in the animaele, 
or naturalle actions: Or in the excreme~tes, 
vvhich are common, or in the vvhole 
bodye, alsoe in the particulare excrementes, 
vvhich the vvoundes reiecte and repelle from 
them. The signes vvhich reveale themselves 
in the qvalitye of the bodye, are considered, 
vvhen vve regarde on the figure, and one her 
coloure: the animaele, and spirituale actions, 
consiste in the stirringe, in feelinge, and in reason. 
The vitall, or the livinge actions, consist 
in the pulse: and the naturalle actions, co~siste, 
in the appetite, in the digestinge, and in 
the expellinge and drivinge forth of the excrementes. 
The common excrements of 
the vvhole bodye are the filthynes of the Nose, 
the teares out of the Eyes, spittle out of the 
mouth, or the substa~ce and filthye matter of 
the guttes, the vrine, or that vvhich vve opvvards 
parbrake: The particulare excrementes, 
are filthe, matter, a~d the bloode: in vvhich 
excrementes, vve must marke and note the 
quantitye, the consistence, colour, smelle, and 
sometimes alsoe one the taste: seinge that if 
ther be more goode, that is soe much the better: 
vve must alsoe note, that throughe the actio~s 
vve may best iudge of the forces. Havinge 
thus therfore togethere considerede and 
noted all these thinges, the Chyrurgiane shal 
be able to geve his sentence and reporte certaynlye, 
ether of lyfe, or of deathe, of lamnes 
or criplenes.

[}Of the necessitye, and vtilitye, of the extractione 
or drawinge forth of all strange 
thinges. Cap. 1.}] 
 
AMongste all operatio~s of Chirurgerye, 
[/44./] 
the aunciente Chyrurgians 
of oulde times, have 
especiallye co~sidered, one the 
ha~dlinge, vvher vvith all vve 
most convenientlye, and aptlye, 
drevve forth out of ma~s bodye all ma~ner 
of straunge & alienate thinges, as are Bullets, 
Arrovves, and all other sortes of vveapons, or 
all peeces of brokene bones, and many other 
such like things as beinge moste necessarye, 
for this foresayd operatione. 
 
It is a Chyrurgiane full of crafte, 
The out of the bodye can plucke shafte. 
 
And even as in the vvarrelike affayres, those 
[/45./] 
Capitaynes are esteemed to be moste couragious 
and valiant, vvhich one the suddayne 
can beste discerne and knovve ther enimyes. 
and allure and as it vveare dravve them, forth 
to their ovvne furtherance, to battayle: oras 
in chasinge, those hunters are esteemed fittest 
and expertest, vvhich suddaynelye can discover, 
or disclose, the harboure of the persecuted 
deere, and knovveth hovv he may vvith al foresight 
chase the same: Even so have the Physitions 
alsoe, had those Chyrurgians in greate 
estimatio~, vvhich first of all, have founde out 
that parte of mans bodye, in the vvhich the 
bulletes, or Arrovves, or anye other alienate 
thinges have binne hidden and lodged, and 
vvhich have hadde knovvledge & science fitlye 
& convenientlye to dravve them therout: 
consideringe that throughe there continuance 
in the same, above al thinges they are cleane 
contrarye vnto vs & vnsufferable, as that 
vvhich is deade, & livinge: so it is a hinderance 
vnto vs, and especialye to that parte, vvherin 
the foresayede vveapon, stickethe, and that as 
vvel of it selfe because that it vvholye, hinderethe 
the curinge of the vvounde, or else because 
it bringethe to gether manye & heavye 
accidentes, the vvhich is cause of lamnesse or 
criplenesse in the vvounded parte: or els causeth 
the health vvhich vve suppose to have 
gotten not to be perfecte, and sure, but is subiecte 
vnto a farre vvorse returne & renueinge 
of the same. Yet for all that I knovve some 
[/46./] 
vvhich are cured, in the vvhich the bullets 
as yet tarrye in some partes of ther bodye vvithout 
beinge necessarye to have searched for 
the same to curionslye, or to pluck it out althoughe 
that vve might easylye have attayned 
there vnto, & touched it, because of the daunger 
that thereof might ensue: as for example, a 
violent bleedinge throughe laceratione of some 
vayne, or arterye: anye great & viole~t payne, 
throughe the stretchinge or dravvinge for 
the of some synnue, or Membranes: An especiallye 
it is not necessarye, curiouslye to search 
after such thinges, or to dravve them forthe, 
vvhich ca~ not rott, or corrupte, as that vvhich 
easylye, or in time can come to rotte. But yet 
it is allvvayes better, that all vvhich is strange 
and alienate vnto mans bodye, and is contayned 
[^f.5v^] 
in the same, be dravvene therout, then to 
lett it tarrye therin, because that the health (as 
vve have al readye sayed) is farre surer, concerninge 
the dau~ger, that is then present, to cause 
the cured vvounde agayne to burst ope~, vvhe~ 
as the bullet, or any such like thinge, co~meth 
to repræse~t himselfe: or that vve shoulde not 
be co~strayned to make an apertione anye vvhere, 
vvhether the fore sayed bullet throughe 
his ponderousnes might chau~ce to be descended. 
 
The Strange thinges of the vvhich in this 
[/47./] 
place vve have spoken, are of tvvo manner of 
sortes, for they are, ether externall, as Iro~, vvoode, 
bullet, stone, or vvolle: or they are any substance 
of our bodyes, as anye splinters or parcells 
of bones, & the co~gealed bloode, vvhich 
vve notvvithstandinge esteme it straunge, because 
they are separated from our bodyes, and 
are noe more partakers of our lyfe, or vitall 
spirites, as they vveare before vvhe~ they as yet 
vveare all one vvith them, vvherfore they are 
novve become strange. 
 
My intente & purpose is nothinge els, then 
[/48./] 
to describe vnto the yonge Chyrurgiane, the 
practice, of all bullets, and of al other strange 
thinges, vvhich might thervvith enter mingle 
themselves, or thervvith might be crushed to 
peeces, hovv to dravve the~ out of the bodye: 
Because in these our dayes heere in Fraunce 
ther is noe other short vsed: seinge that the 
knovvledge of the extractinge of the same, 
may easylye leade vs vnto the knovvledge, 
hovve to dravve forth shaftes, & Arrovves out 
of mans bodye, of the vvhich the aunciente 
professors have verye copiouslie vvritten. 
 
[}Howe that a Chyrurgiane aptly & fitlye to drawe 
a bullet out of the bodye, ought to consider 
their difference, & the nature of the parte, 
in the which it is shot. Chap. 2.}] 
 
THe Chyrurgiane beinge requested 
and desired to dravve 
forth the bullet, havinge pearced 
[/49./] 
& penetrated some parte 
of the bodye vvith leaste 
trouble, & hinderance to the 
patient fitlye, & finelye to accomplish the same, 
because that sometimes they are dravvne 
forth vvith insufferable payne, shall first of all 
consider & marke, that the daunger consistes, 
ether in that parte, in the vvhich such bullets 
are shot, or in the species forms, and difference, 
of the bullets: it is therfore firste of all necessarye, 
that he observe, and knovve, the nature 
and qvallityes of those partes, for some 
partes vvil more gentlye and softlye be handled, 
then others, vvherfore he must consider, 
on the substance, qvantitye, figure and forme, 
compositione, vnitinge, originalle, temperature, 
and one the necessitye & vse of the same 
parte. To the vvhich end & purpose, he must 
note vvhat vvou~des, in the vvhich the bullets 
have binne shott, are incurable, or difficulte, 
or easye to be cured, because that vve may admonishe, 
the frendes, and kindrede of the patiente, 
of those accidentes vvhich might happen 
vnto the vvou~de, the bullet beinge dravvne 
therout, alsoe of the certayntye or feare, 
vvhich throughe the dau~ger, vve are to expecte, 
of the healinge of the same. For first of all 
[/50./] 
Celsus sayeth, that a prudente, and vvyse Chyrurgiane, 
shall not at anye time take in ha~de, 
such a patient, for vvhome it is impossible to 
be curede, & escape death, because he administer 
noe occasione vnto others to suspecte, & 
thincke, that he hath berefte the patient of lyfe, 
vvhich othervvyse throughe the bad fortune 
of his vvounds is disceased. And seinge 
that the dau~ger is greate, but yet notvvithsta~dinge 
entermingled vvith some good hope, 
the~ he shal admonishe the frendes of the patiente, 
that the matter is heavye, and suspecte, 
because if so be the arte & science, be suppressed, 
and overvvonne of the dissease, that they 
should not as then thincke, ether that he hath 
not knovvne therof, or els that he hath sought 
to abuse the frendes. But that such is the office, 
and the dutye, of a vvyse and prudent Chyrurgiane, 
also is it the facte of a Runnagate 
Qvacksalver and deceaver, to make anye thinge, 
seeme to be verye daungerous, vvhich of it 
selfe is easye, and light, because vve shoulde 
thincke, more arte to be in him, then indeede 
theris. It is alsoe seemlye, that the Chyrurgiane 
co~fessinge, the cure to be easye & light, 
doe paune his credit, & reputation, because as 
the~ he might the more vvillinge, thincke one 
that, vvhich might be most commodious and 
profitable, to the curinge and healinge of the 
patient, and that the dissease vvhich of it selfe 
is smalle, throughe the negligence of those, of 
the vvhich the patient is kepte, be made noe 
greater. 
 
To this end Paulus Aegeneta counceleth vs, 
[/51./] 
that if so be, the bullet continue, or tarrye, in 
anye of the vvorthyest partes of the bodye, as 
in the Braynes, Harte, Liver, or throte, in the 
kidnies, bladder, or Matrice, and the signes, & 
tokens of death revealinge themselves vve ca~ 
not by anye meanes possible convenientlye 
vvithout greate paynes, & dilaniatione of the 
vvounded parte dravve forth the foresayed 
bullet, that as the~ vve may not offer to touche 
it, because that vvithout doinge anye good or 
furtherance, vve doe not administer vnto the 
ignorant & common poeple, anye occasion, 
of evell speakinge or blaminge vs. 
 
But allthoughe the issue of the vvounde, be 
[^f.6r^] 
as yet vncertayne, havinge admonished and 
fortoulde the daunger, vve may vvith Gods 
[/52./] 
helpe take the cure in hande: because that some 
havinge an Apostematione, in anye of 
the vvorthyest partes, agaynst the opinione & 
certayntye of the Chyrurgiane, have as yet behelde 
& præserved ther lyfe: yea vve have alsoe 
seen & behelde some, in the vvhich a parcell 
of ther Liver, one parte of the Epiploon, the 
vvhole VVombe hath fro~ them binne separated, 
or hevved & cutte of, the patient for all 
this hath binne cured, and præserved to lyfe. 
VVe have alsoe at some times in a veheme~te 
& greate squinantie, perced & made an apertione 
in the throte. But if soe be that vve suffer 
the bullet to continuue in the bodye, or in 
anye parte of the same, vvithout extractinge 
of the same, vvhen that easylye he may be 
dravvne forth, it necessarylye follovveth, that 
the patie~t must dye therofe, it might also bringe 
the Physicion, or Chyrurgiane into the name 
of bei~ge cruell, & mercylesse, vvher other 
vvyse the bullet bei~ge dravvne forth, it might 
be that the patient might as yet be curede, 
vvherfore the Chyrurgiane must alvvayes endevoure 
& doe the best he can, vvhen he hath 
forttoulde, & admonished the frendes of the 
patient, of the daunger, because some times 
greate & fearfull vvou~des beyo~de the expectatio~s 
of all me~ are cured, vvherfore vve ought 
not at anye, time to permit or suffer the patie~te 
vvithout helpe or succoure, vvhere ther 
[/53./] 
is anye smalle hope of beinge cured. And all 
thoughe that all thinges of this our operatione 
fall not out accordinge vnto oure minde, 
yet notvvithstandinge, must not vve leave to 
effecte that vvhich this arte & science reqvireth, 
& that vvhich our co~science vvitnesseth 
vnto vs. 
 
Above all that the Chyrurgiane must considere, 
[/54./] 
on the vvounded parte, he must alsoe 
farther consider one the differe~ce, & varietye 
of bulletes, vvhich consisteth, in the matter, 
forme, qvantitye, number, and facultye of the 
same. As concerninge & touchinge the matter, 
althoughe that the foresayed bulletes, 
most commonlye are of leade yet for all that 
sometimes the besieged, & they that skermishe 
in the feelds are constrayned to vse tinne 
bullets, Copper, peeces of iron, steel, peasen, 
yea & alsoe little stones or pebles. As concerninge 
the figure or forme therof they are 
most commonlye rovvnde, although ther are 
some shotte vvith three corners, some foure 
corners, & some of other fashons. Touchinge 
the qvantitye, ther is great difference concerninge 
the greatenes of the peeces, by the 
vvhich the bullets are shott. As for the nu~ber, 
& constitutione of the foresayed bullets, ther 
are some vvhich shoote, vvith more. the~ vvith 
one bullet, vvith some vvhich are fastened 
the one, vvith the other, vvith little chayned 
Bullets, vvith hayle shote, vvhich spreade the~selves, 
in the bodye of a man. Speakinge 
of the forces or facultyes, of bullets I have 
not as yet geven anye credite vnto them that 
sayed the bullets might be poysened, because 
as yet ther hath binne never a famous Chyrurgiane 
vvhich ever had a venomous shotte 
vvounde in hande in these our tymes vvhich 
hath made anye me~tione therofe, as is playnlye 
shevved, in the discourse of the disceased 
the right vvorshipfull M Ambrosius Pare, 
chiefe Chyrurgiane to the kinge his maiestye 
vvhich hath verye learnedlye discussed & as it 
vveare grovvnded this questione in his boockes 
of Chyrurgerye. 
 
[}The bullets, & all other straunge things ought in 
the first dressinge to be drawne forth, soe farre 
as it is possible to be done: & of the meanes 
how to effecte the same. Chap. 3.}] 
 
WHen that the Chyrurgiane 
shall have co~sidered, one the 
parte, & also a little observed, 
one the varietye, & difference 
of bullets, he shall chuse, a certayne 
nu~ber of instrumentes 
vvhich co~tinuallye he ought to have by him, 
especiallye those, vvich he supposeth tobe 
most fittest to dravv forth the fore sayed bullet 
vvith most facilitye & ease. The vvhiche he 
[/55./] 
shall at the first dressinge, vvithout anye longer 
delaye, vnto the next daye, put in vre and 
practise: for the bullet beinge dravvne out, 
shall the patie~t, & Chyrurgiane alsoe be freed 
from great daunger, the vvhich both of them 
vvith all right ought to desire and longe for. 
The bullet may alsoe præsentlye, vvhile the 
vvounde is freshe & greene, be felt vvith the 
finger, or most fitlye vvith the privet or searchinge 
iro~ vvithout tarryinge vntill the next 
daye, because that the vvounded parte, throughe 
anye concurringe humors, svvelleth out 
of ha~de, throughe the payne of the vvounde, 
by the vvhich the entrance of the vvounde 
co~meth to svvelle, as alsoe throughe the force 
of the bullet, anye of the Me~branes or Te~dones, 
beinge brused the foresayed entra~ce of 
the vvounde, stoppeth: because most co~monlye 
shotten vvoundes doe not enter right, or 
liniallye into the bodye, but turninge, & alsoe 
vvith any Membranes, or tendones rovvnde 
about vvounde, & circumcingled, as alsoe the 
bullet through his ponderousnes, runninge 
this vvay or that vvay, chaunceth to fall into 
some hollovve place, vvhich sometimes frustrateth, 
& annihilateth the knovvledge of the 
Chyrurgiane, so that by anye meanes possible, 
he can nether touch nor finde him: above 
all this, the foresayed vvounde, is the seconde 
day more sensible, & tender, then vvhen shee 
[^f.6v^] 
is freshe, as the patient allsoe vvhile that the 
vvounde is fresh & vvarme, is better able to 
abide the sovvnding or searchinge iro~, or privett: 
& that vvhich is more, the vvounded havinge 
obtayned noe time to thincke, & consider 
[/56./] 
of his vvou~de, his harte beinge as yet puffed 
vp with vayn glorye, is not as yet at the 
first dressinge, posessed vvith anye timorousnes 
or feare, as he is in the seconde or thirde 
dressinge: vvherfore in his frist dressi~ge, vvith 
more courage, & patience, is able to beare the 
payne, and dravvinge forth of the bullet. 
 
First of all therfore, if so be that by anye 
meanes vve ca~ nether finde nor feele the bullet, 
to acomplisshe & effecte this vvorke, fitlye 
& convenientlye, vvith the leaste trouble 
& payne of the patient, vve are constrayned to 
cause the patient to sit or stande, in such a forme, 
& posture, or, collocatione as he sate or 
stoode, vvhe~ as the bullet vvas shot into his 
bodye, yea alsoe vvith the same gesture, & behavioure, 
[/57./] 
vvhich he vsed: for the chainginge 
of the forme as vvhe vve fight, or vvhen 
vve are layed alo~ge, or vvhe~ vve sta~de vpright, 
or beinge sett dovvne, causeth a greate alteratione, 
in the beinge, and situatione, of these 
partes of the patiente, because the vaynes, arteryes, 
synnues, bones, & muscles, may one so 
manye vvayes & fashons be turnede & vvou~de, 
as they have divers vses, & actions vnto the 
vvhich they ar fitt, it be ether in the erecti~ge, 
or in the stoupinge, or in the turni~ge: vvhich 
often times is the occasione, that altough vve 
search, & feele for the bullet, any muscle lye anye 
other vvay turned, then it did, vvhen the 
foresayed muscle vvas pearcede vvith the bullet, 
the vvou~de in that place most commo~lye 
beinge stopt, soe that for the most part the searchinge 
iron can not enter that place vvher 
the bullet lyeth: But vvhen vve shall have set 
the patient on such a manner, as he stoode, or 
sat, vvhe~ he vvas shot, the~ come all the partes 
into the same situatione, as they vveare vvhe~ 
he vvas shott, vvherfore, as the~ the proofe or 
searchge iron, may passe verye easylye, vvithout 
any let, eve~ into that place vvheras the 
bullet lyeth. And soe farre forth as the patie~t, 
co~sideringe his greate imbicillitye & vveakenes, 
hath hot the strengthe to sta~de in that ordre, 
vve must as the~ at the leaste, ether sittinge 
or lyinge, turne, & vvinde him on such a ma~ner, 
vvhether he sitti~ge or lyinge, in as much 
as is possible, as he vvas vvhe~ he receaved the 
shott. Novve beinge in such a situatione, vve 
[/58./] 
are first of all counceled, if soe be that the vvou~de 
be narrovve, as alsoe all auncie~te Chyrurgia~s 
teache 'vve must as the~ dilate the vvou~de, because 
the bullet, or that vvhich is therin, may 
have a free passage: for ther is nothinge, that 
causeth more in flammatione, then dilaceratione, 
or tearinge of the fleshe, vvhe~ as vvith 
violence vve seeke to dravve out anye thinge 
out of the vvou~de, vvherfore it is better to make 
the, dilatatione vvith a little rasore then 
vvith viole~ce to teare op the vvou~de: further 
vve must note, that in the dilati~ge of the vvou~de, 
vve chaunce not to hurte anye synnues, 
vaynes, or arteryes: the vvhich if youe perceave, 
you shall eschevve & avoyde the~, or vvith 
a little & blunte hoocke pluk them one the 
one syde, & proceede betvvixt them, as Celsus 
in his 5 cap. of his seave~th booke teacheth vs. 
 
After that vve sufficie~tlye dilate the vvou~de 
[/59./] 
vve must them search for the bullet or that 
vvhich is shot in the vvounde, & feele first of 
all vvith your finger, if it is possible, as vvith 
out doubt it is, the beste searchinge iron & in 
feelinge vve must co~sider vvhat vvay the bullet 
hath taken, & if it be deeper the~ the length 
of your finger, as then vve must vse ther vnto 
the common searchinge iron, vvhich must be 
reasonable thick, and at the lovver end verye 
rovvnde, for if soe be, it be to sharpe pearceth, 
and goeth betvveene tvvo muscles, vvith out 
follovvinge that vvay vvhich the bullet vve~t. 
 
VVhen as therfore vve have certaynlye 
[/60./] 
fovvnde out the bullet, the thirde instructione 
is that vve dravve him forthe to the effectinge 
of the vvhich, ther is nothi~ge surer, the~ 
to dravve him throughe the same place, by 
vvhich he entered, & especiallye vvhe~ he hath 
not penetrated to deepe, or passed throughe 
anye greate vayne, arterye, or synnue, because 
the vvay is allreadye made, vvherfore vve 
neede not make any other inscisione. 
 
Amongst all instrume~ts vvhich ever I have 
[/61./] 
vsed, I have conte~ted my selfe best, vvith that 
instrume~te, vvhich vve call, the spoonevvyse, 
or spoonefashoned bullet dravver, because 
this instrument, may both be vsed fore a searge 
iron, & a bullet extractor alsoe, soe that as 
soone as vve heervvith feele the bullet vve 
may alsoe at that time, plucke him out: but pe 
arcinge verye deepe, & one the co~trarye syde 
is little substa~ce, & vvithout greate vaynes, & 
vve vvith our fingers may feele the bullet, it is 
the~ better, & rather cou~celed, ther to make an 
apertione, namelye, on the co~trary syde, of the 
entra~ce of the bullet, then to dravve the same 
by the vvay vvhich he entrede, consideringe 
the greate dista~ce, and space, throughe vvhich 
he beinge dravvne backvvardes, must of necessitye 
passe bye, as alsoe the payne is farre greaater, 
vvhe~ vvith the bullet, & vvith the instrume~t, 
the vvou~de internallye co~meth to teare, 
& bruse the Fleshe, the~ vvhe~by inscisione vve 
dilate the vvou~de, by vvhich shee is alsoe sooner 
cured, because that vvhich is cutt, more 
re easier & sooner is healed, then that vvhich 
through dilaniatione is vvounded: and if 
it be possible, the foresayed inscisione 
muste be made right vnder the bullet, but so~vvhat 
greater then the bullett, because the~ vve 
neede not dravve him forth vvith anye viole~ce, 
[^f.7r^] 
& doe not chaunce to lacerate the vvou~de: 
This beinge in this sorte finished, vve shall 
finde the bullet a great deale neerer vnto vs, & 
more easyer to be dravvne therout, vvithout 
passinge by to great & tedious a vvaye, in the 
dravvinge forth, of that vvay by the vvhich he 
entered, yea vvhich is more, the vvounde vvil 
[/62./] 
a greate deale sooner be cured, and vvith lesse 
daunger, the vvounde havinge tvvo issues, to 
vvit the one vnder, & the other above, partlye 
because shee may receave the remedyes the 
better, as alsoe co~sideringe the matter, vvhich 
one both sydes hath her issue, vvhich othervvyse 
might be retayned, & collect or gather it 
self together in the bottome of the vvounde.
