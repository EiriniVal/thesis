maintaines youthfull beautie in the face, it being washt therwith. 
Being inwardly taken it breakes the stone in the raynes, and expels 
it. It prouokes vrine, though formerly stopt by a carnositie. 
It heales all sorts of wounds, and that in any part, being applyed 
with a feather. It relieues the Hectick. Easeth the Cough. Drieth 
Rhewmes. Takes away the ache of the huckle bones, if the 
place affected be therewith fomented. Secondly, the oyle (called 
by some the mother of Balme, speedily cures [/48./] all sorts of scabs, 
and wormes in the skin, Leprosies, and Vlcers, and that without 
corosion. Thirdly, the Balme it selfe is profitable against 
innumerable infirmities, griefes, and maladies. First it's soueraigne 
[/49./] against wounds in the head, where both the bones and 
membranes are hurt. It's admirable against the Pleurisie, if +Q j. 
thereof be giuen to drinke with Balme-water: +Q ij. thereof so 
administred, doth sodainely driue away the paines of the sides. 
It mightily auailes against the Cough, Rhewmes, and all cold affects 
of the head and stomacke. It benefiteth the whole head, if 
the sutures thereof shall (once in a day) be therewith rub'd. For 
by reason of it's penetrating vertue, it aduantageth both parts 
and places, though much remote. It cures Quartane Agues, if 
the whole body bee therewith anoynted, so as there bee not any 
part thereof left vntoucht. In a word: it promiscuously cures all 
infirmities, both hot and cold by a certaine hidden propertie.

either by firinge, tent, or pledget, as the forme of the wound requires: 
Then forthwith close the orifice of the wound, s.a. either

Gilbert. Rules obserued by the Author in the ordaining 
of the drinkes. First, that if there be any danger of a feuer, 
that then he made these drinkes with water and sugar, and not 
with wine and hony. Secondly, that the Patients diet, should 
be free from milke, cheese, egges, fruites, and flesh of vngelded 
beasts or foules, and that he eate vnleauened bread. As for carnall 
copulation, all other authors forbid. Further obseruations of 
the same author. Giue vnto a wounded person to drinke Succi 
pilosellæ, if he cast it againe (in what part soeuer the wound be) 
he shall die; but if he retaine it, he shall liue. Then for the first, 
giue him to drinke, plantaginem & fragariam. The second day, 
giue him the same againe garyophillatam being thereto added. 
The third day, add pilosellam to the former. The fourth day doe 
as yee did on the third. The fifth day, add to the former, hederam 
terrestrem; the which continue vntill the seuenth day. After 
which, you shall decline your method, as you did formerly augment 
it, vntill you come to the hearbes of the first day, wherewith 
you began. Another order practised by some, and recorded 
by our Author. First, they wash the wound with warme water: 
Next they apply the lard of bacon, stamped with wormwood, for 
iij. daies: After that, whites of egges with flaxe, for foure daies. 
In the meane time, they giue also a drinke made ex vino vel: ceruisia
