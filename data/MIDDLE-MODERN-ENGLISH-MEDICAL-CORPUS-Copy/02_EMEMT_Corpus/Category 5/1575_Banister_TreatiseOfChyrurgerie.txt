[}The definition of an Vlcer, 
and the difference 
betvveene an Vlcer 
and a wounde.}] 
 
AS my chiefest intention 
is in this parte, 
to entreat of Ulcers, so 
do I purpose first to define 
what an Ulcer is, 
[/1./] 
whiche after the minde 
of Auicen, is a solution of continuitie in 
the fleshe, conteining corruption and putrefaction. 
For by the name of an Ulcer, 
we vnderstande that separation of vnion, 
whiche is not simple as a wounde, but is 
alwaye founde annexed with other dispositions 
and accidentes, hindring the cure 
thereof. Whereupon it commeth, that 
[/2./] 
an Ulcer is to be vnderstanded as a compound 
affection, or vnnaturall motion: 
[^f.1v^] 
Notwithstanding, no man is so ignorant 
(bearing y=e= name of a Chirurgian) but he 
knoweth, that in woundes also is contayned 
certaine dispositions necessarily chau~cing: 
as bignes, litlenes, streitnes, crookednes, 
equalitie, inequalitie, depth and 
height, &c. Whiche make the differences 
[/3./] 
in woundes. To conclude therfore, that is 
to be called an Ulcer, where as there is 
corruption. And that a wounde, where (as 
yet) there is no putrefaction. Of the like 
opinion also is Corn. Celsus, and in manner 
[/4./] 
also Hippocrates, affirming y=t= to be 
a wounde which is yet new and bloudy, & an 
Ulcer, when it is become olde or inueterate. 
And thus farre as touching the 
definition of an Ulcer, and the difference 
betweene the Ulcer and the wounde: the 
differences general with the acccidentes, 
after followeth. 
 
[}The differences of Vlcers and vvherof 
they be taken.}] 
 
THe differences of Ulcers are diuersly 
taken, but especially of three causes. 
viz. from the causes prouoking them, fro~ 
the members, and from the accidentes or 
[^f.2r^] 
dispositions ioyned with the~. Other take 
them onely of two, as from the causes and 
accidentes, and also from the natural dispositions 
them selues, to whiche they are 
enwrapped, and passe ouer those differences, 
whiche are taken of the members or 
labouringe partes, because they belong 
not to an vniuersall treatise. These therefore 
be the diuers sortes of Ulcers, & true 
differences taken of the causes, that is to 
wit, a virulent Ulcer, a corroding Ulcer, 
a filthy rotten or putrified Ulcer, a hollowe 
& depe Ulcer, an Ulcer full of holes 
and a cancred Ulcer. And the differences 
which do come of the accide~tes & natural 
dispositions, to which the woundes them 
selues be ioyned, are also diuers. Which 
of the Chirurgia~s of later time are thus 
described. viz. an Ulcer w=t= inte~peratnes, 
whiche y=e= Grecians call Discratu~, a dolorous 
Ulcer, an Ulcer with a swelling or 
tumor against nature (commonly called 
impostumation) a broken Ulcer, an Ulcer 
ouergrowen with superfluous fleshe, 
which y=e= Grecians call [^GREEK OMITTED^], a hard 
Ulcer, a cankred Ulcer, a hollowe vlcer, 
an Ulcer corrupt at the bone, an Ulcer 
[^f.2v^] 
with diuers separatio~s, & an Ulcer called 
Cacoethes, which is a wicked, cruel, & very 
hard Ulcer to be healed, and others of 
that sorte. But these many and diuers differences 
of Ulcers, are not supposed of 
Galene to be true differences of Ulcers, 
but only agreeings of other effectes with 
the Ulcer, of which sorte are, the cankred 
Ulcer, the ouergrowen, putrefied and hollowe 
Ulcers. And the Ulcer with some 
swelling, as the Ulcer called Phlegmonodes, 
and Resipelatodes, or the cankred 
rottennes, the infla~mation of bloude, the 
canker, and residue of that sort, are of the 
kinde of effectes besides nature, corrupting 
the actions whiche seuerally and by 
them selues may existe and bee. For that 
thing (saith Galen) which can consiste seuerally, 
shall neuer be the difference of an 
other. 
 
Let this therefore be as a precepte and 
rule, by whiche thou maiste discerne whether 
the difference of an effect be any other 
thing, or the enwrapping of an other naturall 
motion, but after an other sort. Also 
the vexing and dolorous Ulcer, and 
the filthie vlcer, are called (as it were certaine 
[^f.3r^] 
differe~ces of vlcers, whe~ as in deed 
they are not true & proper differe~ces, but 
the ioyning rather of an accident with an 
vlcer. &c. In like sorte the Ulcer called 
Vlcus cacochymon, is an Ulcer replenished 
with euill iuyce, or troubled with a 
rheumatick matter ther caused, being ioyned 
with theffect. Many such therfore are 
vsurped of common Chirurgians & Phisicians, 
for the differe~ces of Ulcers which 
are in deede no differences, but onely (as 
Galene saith) binding together other dispositions, 
or the effectes of that which is 
compounded. The proper and true differences 
of a simple Ulcer are taken of the 
nature thereof. And that (saith Galen) is 
a simple Ulcer, which doth only exist, that 
is, wherto no other affect or accide~t is ioyned. 
It shall not therfore be a simple Ulcer 
[/5./] 
if any other part be exulcerated, or be 
vexed with a rheumatick matter, or euill 
iuyce, or altogether without natural temperature, 
full of hollownes. &c. 
 
Therefore the differences taken of the 
[/6./] 
nature of the vlcers are moste proper, & 
of the substaunce of the thing, and co~ming 
outwarde. They are taken of the substa~ce 
[^f.3v^] 
of the thing whiche are brought from the 
fourme & bignes or qua~titie of y=e= diuisio~, & 
from y=e= measure or space. Fro~ the forme, 
[/7./] 
as the streight Ulcer, the Ulcer declined 
or bowed, the rounde or compassed vlcer, 
the wrythen and the crooked vlcer: from 
the bignes of the diuision or quantitie, as 
a great vlcer, a litle vlcer of the measures 
or spaces, as a long vlcer, a short vlcer, a 
broade vlcer, a narrowe vlcer, a highe vlcer, 
or an vlcer in the toppe or height of any 
parte, a depe vlcer, an equall vlcer, an 
vnequall vlcer. 
 
And the differe~ces of the vlcers co~ming 
[/8./] 
extrinsecall, are taken of the time, of the 
waye of generation, as all the vlcer or 
scarce part thereof cannot be seen or beholden, 
the differences of the tyme, as a 
newe vlcer, or olde vlcer. Of the reason of 
the generation, as a cut vlcer, a broke~ vlcer, 
an vlcer partly cut, partly broken. Of 
the placing in thaffected part, as an vlcer 
euidently appearing or out of sight, an vlcer 
hidden within or not appearing. Also 
an vlcer in the beginning of the muscle, 
in the middest, or in the end of the muscle. 
The differences of vlcers taken of the affected 
[^f.4r^] 
place, though they are to be iudged 
vlcers, yet not (as Gal. saith) of their 
owne propre nature, as the aforesayd differences 
are taken: for the places wherein 
the vlcers doe consiste are similar, and 
organicall, therfore to shewe the differences 
of places wherein the vlcer is, the diuision 
must be after this sorte, from thaffected 
place. An vlcer in the similar organick 
or instrumentall part, deuiding also 
the differences of vlcers in the similar 
parte after this sorte. viz. Ulcers in the 
veines, vlcers in the arteries, vlcers in y=e= 
skinne, and vlcers in the muscles, for the 
muscle and the similar part, is easie to be 
discerned by sense. And the differences of 
the affectes in the organicke parte, are of 
this sorte. The vlcer of the eare, the vlcer 
in the Iawes, the vlcer in the sharpe or 
rough arterie, vlcer of the lunges, vlcer of 
the brest, vlcer of the yarde, vlcer of the 
fundament and seate, and so forthe in lyke 
order discoursing the singuler partes of 
the body, whiche wee call instrumentall. 
And this is the complete and absolute diuision 
of a simple and only vlcer, and of an 
vlcer to whome no other affect is ioyned 
[^f.4v^] 
in his differences taken of his propre nature. 
Also if any affect or disposition doe 
consiste by it selfe, as Phlegmon, Gangrena, 
or putrefaction, there cannot the differences 
of vlcers be taken thereby, or at 
least bee so called properly. But for because 
it is spoke~ of Galen at least in 600. 
places, let vs not holde any co~tention vppon 
[/9./] 
the names. For if any man should cal 
the putrefied vlcer, y=e= corrosiue vlcer, Ga~grena, 
Erisipelas, the cancrous vlcer, the 
holed or cornered vlcer, the vlcer with putrefaction 
at the bone, the vlcer called Cacoethes, 
the painfull vlcer, and all others 
of that sorte: If any man (I saye) should 
prescribe these as differe~ces of vlcers, we 
ought not to contende with him, so that 
he minister right curation to euery of the~. 
And they are called differences of vlcers 
taken of that wherto they are ioyned, that 
is to saye, the differences of the thinges 
conteined with the disease: the differences 
of the thinges conteined with the accidentes: 
and the differe~ces of the things 
conteyned with the causes and others (if 
any be) of like sort. 
 
[^f.5r^] 
[}Of the causes of Vlcers.}] 
 
THe latter sect of Chirurgians haue instituted 
[/10./] 
two generall causes throughout 
all vlcers, that is to saye, the Antecedent 
causes named of the Grekes [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
And the coniunctiue causes also called 
[^GREEK OMITTED^]. The antecedent causes are 
these, viz. cutting, breaking, tearing, and 
suche like solution of continuitie, whiche 
cannot euen by & by stirre vp Sanies, Pus, 
or Sordicies, which are iudged necessarily 
to associate the vlcers, although it may be 
done in time, & that in remouing the antecedent 
and corporall causes. Therefore 
the antecedent causes of vlcers is Cacochima, 
whiche is euill iuyce, and that is, 
when the humors haue onely defaulte in 
qualitie and not in quantitie: and also to 
muche aboundance of those peruerse humors 
being in the bodye, may at lengthe 
corrupt and putrifie the said partes of the 
same body. Furthermore, the wickednes 
of the said iuyce, is either engendred by a 
peruerse kynde of diet, or throughe the 
whole body, or els some particuler member: 
as through default, which may be either 
in the liuer or splene, as Galene in diuers 
[^f.5v^] 
places hath sufficiently testified. 
 
The coniunctiue causes is said to be that 
[/11./] 
intemperature, whiche is called the malice 
of complexion in the wounded partes 
through the antecede~t causes, or through 
the woundes and hurtes them selues, or 
other tumors against nature, but especially 
through malignaunt vlcers, either 
broken, opened or stirred. For eue~ the corroding 
vlcer is engendred Ex herpete & 
miliari, called of the Grekes Cenchrias, & 
also of Esthiomeno, whiche is an eating 
vlcer proceding of choller more grosse & 
thicke, so maye it also happen of the carbuncle, 
chiefly if it be venemous, whiche 
maketh an escharous vlcer, ful of bankes, 
filthy, and full of depe hollowes. Wherefore 
[/12./] 
these three are accompted vlcers rebellious 
& hard to be cured. First because 
of intemperature, which commeth to the 
subiect fleshe. Secondly through defaulte 
of the bloud thereto resorting. And thirdly 
through copie and quantitie of the matter 
flowing, as Galene credibly hath vs 
[/13./] 
enfourmed. He also affirmeth that the same 
diuision may be made otherwyse, that 
is of curable, and also rebellious vlcers, 
[^f.6r^] 
the one for intemperature of the vlcerated 
fleshe, and the other in respecte of the 
humor flowing, and the same intemperature 
also may be deuided twoo manner of 
wayes, viz. when the fleshe is subiecte to 
the onely qualitie of nature aboue measure, 
or otherwyse when there is present 
some accesse or certaine tumor. Now also 
that flowing may be deuided into twoo 
partes, that is as well in the qualitie as 
also in the qua~titie of the humor flowing. 
 
There shalbe therefore foure kyndes 
[/14./] 
of vlcers, contumelious or hard to be cured: 
that is to witte, the onely intemperature 
of the subiect fleshe, whiche wee call 
Discrasia, inte~perature with an accessiue 
tumor, the humor flowing, or vitious, or 
much, for the humor which floweth abundantly 
into the greuous part of the vlcer, 
yea although it be not vitious, yet (for because 
it engendreth therein excrementes) 
it hindreth the healing with long detraction 
of tyme. Galen seemeth also to make 
and adde hereto a fift kinde in his Co~me~tarie 
vpo~ the Aphorisme of Hippocrates, 
[/15./] 
which beginneth thus. Vlc. quæ cunq~ annua 
sunt. &c. whiche is the passion of the 
[^f.6v^] 
corrupted bone in the vlcered place. For 
when the fleshe which couereth the bone 
hauing applied (according to art) exiccatiue 
medicines) receiueth cicatrice: by and 
by it semeth perfectly restored and amended, 
but shortly after some matter thither 
resorting from the corrupt bone, reduceth 
in the healed part a present infla~mation, so 
that after, there followeth not onely generation 
of matter, but also erosion of the 
aforesayd cicatrice & exulceration of flesh. 
And as we may plainly gather by Galen, 
[/16./] 
among the aforesaide affectes and dispositions, 
al others to be vnited and knit, and 
that many and diuers differences of vlcers 
doe spring of those aboue mencioned. 
Furthermore, there must be a methode of 
healing shewed and declared, not of al together, 
but euery one by him selfe, which 
shall followe after, beginning onely with 
the cure of simple thinges, that therby the 
waye and meane to heale the compounde 
affectes may the more easely be attained. 
 
Now, seing that as we entreat throughly 
of vlcers, these wordes Sanies, Pus, virus, 
Ichor, Sordes, and such like, are much 
in vse, I think it not much forth of y=e= way, 
[^f.7r^] 
if in this place we shew what those words 
doe signifie among the Chyrurgians, and 
that in fewe wordes, how they agree and 
disagre. Sanies. i. ichor, is properly y=t= thin 
[/17./] 
humor, which the Grekes cal [^GREEK OMITTED^], suche 
as is in a wounde, neither newe nor olde, 
but betwene both, and some kinde of this 
Ichor is interpreted Sanies sanguinis, the 
matter of bloud. And of Sanies saith Celsus, 
[/18./] 
be twoo kindes, the one named [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
and the other [^GREEK OMITTED^]. [^GREEK OMITTED^], being thin 
and halfe white, proceading of an euill vlcer, 
and chiefly where as a sinewe being 
hurt, infla~mation is gathered. Meliceria 
is more grosse, glewie, and like to white 
honie, proceding also of euil vlcers, wher 
the sinewes about the ioyntes be hurt, in 
which places it greatly floweth. 
 
But nowe amongest the newe and later 
[/19./] 
Physitio~s and Chyrurgia~s, who not 
obseruing the true proprietie of voice, or 
agreeing vpon the nature of the thing, do 
wrongfullye vsurpe the name of Pus, in 
steede of Sanies, sometime they make Sanies 
a kinde of Sordes, Virus, Virulentu~, 
and Purulentam colluuiem called of the 
Grekes [^GREEK OMITTED^], and of the Latines Pus. For 
[^f.7v^] 
the name of Sanies being truely defined, 
signifieth all humiditie altered aboue nature. 
Wherefore if the humor be thinne 
whiche proceedeth from the vlcer, it is called 
Virus or virulentia. If it be thicker, 
[/20./] 
Sordes. And if it be in a meane betwixte 
both, it hath to name by proper appellatio~ 
Sanies. And it is saide to be found aboundantly 
[/21./] 
in vlcers, and but little in deepe 
woundes. Sanies therefore is properlye 
among the vulgar Phisitions and Chirurgians, 
the same that Pus is among y=e= 
Latines, and [^GREEK OMITTED^] among the Grecians. 
Celsus calleth it the Genus, hauing vnder 
it twoo kindes conteined called of the 
Grekes [^GREEK OMITTED^] and [^GREEK OMITTED^], the whiche 
ichor of the Latine interpretors is called 
and turned to Sanies and Meliceria called 
[/22./] 
Pus, hauing the beginning of contused 
flesh or bloud. But in the generatio~ therof, 
there is a doubtfull or halfe euil transmutation 
or alteration. For as Galene 
[/23./] 
saith, there is in the bodies of liuing creatures 
three alterations. One plaine and 
according to nature, y=t= is when the meate 
is digested in the bellie, bowelles, or vesselles, 
wherein the iuyces are engendred, 
[^f.8r^] 
and from whence euery parte receiueth 
nourishme~t. An other plainly against nature. 
[/24./] 
viz. in putrefying all thinges, & this 
(after a certaine manner) is contrarie to 
it selfe. The thirde is mixt or in a meane 
doing, partly according to nature, & partly 
contrarie to nature. 
 
Therefore the transmutation or alteration, 
whiche doth engender Pus, hath 
the middest place amo~g the best transmutation, 
which is the nourishement of the 
partes of liuing thinges, and that whiche 
is simply the worste, whiche is made stinking 
with putrefaction. For neither of 
onely heat against nature, neither of heat 
obtained according to nature is suppuration 
or Pus engendred. But the heate of 
the infla~mation is (after a certaine manner) 
mixte of them both, whiche whilest it 
gathereth to suppuration, moueth great 
paine, and by the heat aboue nature of the 
inflamed part, feuers oftentimes are raised, 
and that by extreeme heating y=e= harte. 
And these twoo doe chaunce (as it were of 
a certaine boyling or burning of y=e= bloud, 
which being throughly exusted or burnt, 
the remnaunt of it is made Pus, as by the 
[^f.8v^] 
altering of wood into ashes by burning, 
as Galene hath left testified in his Commentarie 
vppon Hippocrates, thus beginning. 
Dum pus conficit. &c. By this 
nowe it is manifestly proued what pus is, 
howe it is engendred, and what is the efficient 
cause and matter thereof. Nowe we 
will shewe in fewe woordes what Virus, 
Virulentia, and Sordes are amongest the 
Chirurgians. Virus or Virulentia, is a 
[/25./] 
subtile superfluitie begotten of abunda~ce 
of watrie humors, which (saieth Guydo) 
is of twoo sortes, hote and colde, whealike 
or ruddie. But Sordes is a certaine 
[/26./] 
superfluitie more thicke, engendred of humors 
hauing a thicker substaunce, which 
truly is of three sortes, for some is thicke, 
vnequall, heaped, and white, & some black 
and like dregges mixt with ashes. 
 
Furthermore, that which they cal Virus, 
Galene calleth it in Greke [^GREEK OMITTED^], in latine 
[/27./] 
Sanies. But to saye at one woorde Sanies 
or Virus, is that thinne excrement in 
vlcers which co~tinually moistneth them, 
euen as Sordes thickneth the~, whiche procureth 
the vlcer named Rhyparon, that 
[/28./] 
is Sordidum. For euen as (Galen saith) 
[^f.9r^] 
the excrementes whether they bee thicke 
or thinne, doe followe euery mutation of 
the qualitie of the nourishement. So is 
there wont to be a double kinde of excrement, 
and that chiefly in hollowe vlcers: 
that is to saye a thinner, called in Latine 
Sanies, in Greke [^GREEK OMITTED^], and a thicker also 
named Sordes. Of the thinne excrement, 
the vlcer is made moiste, and of the grosser, 
filthie, whereof it commeth, that the 
sayde vlcer nedeth twoo sortes of medicines, 
viz. to drie that which is moist, and 
to mundifie the filthie, but these thinges 
doe belonge to an other contemplation. 
But Pus doth chose (as it were) a middle 
[/29./] 
substaunce betweene thicke and thinne, especially 
if it be that which is good. For 
that is best (saith Hippocrates) which is 
white, light, equall, and without noisome 
[/30./] 
sauour. And that is euill (sayeth Celcus) 
whiche is thinne, watrishe (especially if it 
be so from the beginning) also if y=e= coloure 
be like whay, pale, yellowe, or like dregs, 
and besides that, if it smell euill. There 
is an other kynde of Pus saieth the same 
Corn. Celsus, called in Greke [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
[/31./] 
which is apparauntly founde in great vlcers 
[^f.9v^] 
beginning to heale, which is thinne, 
half white, and as it were vnctuouse, not 
vnlike the white fattines of oile. That Sanies 
is euill which is muche in quantitie, 
[/32./] 
ouer thinne, yellow, pale, or black, glewy, 
or of euill sauour, or if it corrode in the 
same vlcer, or the skinne nere thereto, & is 
litle better, if it be somwhat more grosse, 
half red or whitishe. Therefore the better 
that the excrementes aforesaid appeareth 
in vlcers, the better hope is to be had in 
their curatio~: euen as that wound is like 
to be cured with expedition, whiche hathe 
good and freshe bloude flowing from it, 
wherefore the signes both good and euil, 
in euery of these, must of the Chirurgian 
be diligently wayed. So that he may either 
reprehend, or pronounce what vlcers 
be vncurable, which be easie to be cured, 
and which be harde to be cured. Whiche 
thing is of no small weight, and the Chirurgian 
thereby may laudably be wondred 
at and auoyde cauillouse slaunders. 
And this saide, shall suffice as touchinge 
Pus, Sanies, and Sordes. Nowe it resteth 
that we speake of the signes of vlcers, and 
likewyse of the iudgementes. 
 
[^f.10r^] 
[}The signes to knovve the differences 
of vlcers taken of the definitions.}] 
 
EUerie vlcer hath his proper note or token, 
whereby he is discried and knowe~ 
from an other, and they are taken of the 
definitions of euery of them. Wherefore 
I suppose it to be worthy the labour here 
to recite by the waye, the short definitio~s 
of the chiefe differences aboue me~cioned, 
wherein doing, wee woulde not haue the 
Reader to regarde so much the woordes 
as the thing it selfe. For we had rather 
vse the common definitio~s allowed long 
agoe of all professours, though they bee 
more rude and common, then with eloquence 
(though it were more pure stile) to 
cast a mist vpon that thing whiche is obscure 
enough of it selfe. Notwithstanding 
I haue eschewed, in euery place as muche 
as I might laufully, that grosse and idle 
barbarousnes. Therfore to go to the purpose, 
that is a virulent Ulcer wherein is 
poyson, which is a certaine thinne, and liquid 
excreme~t, called properly of the Latines 
Sanies, abounding about erosion, 
[^f.10v^] 
called also by an other name Saniosum. 
The vlcer whiche by the malignitie and 
malice thereof doth stirre vp euill and byting 
iuyce, which eateth and gnaweth the 
affected part, & is made by the increase of 
humors more ample daily, is named Corrosiuum, 
[/33./] 
or Arrodens. But if the malice 
thereof do so much encrease, that not only 
it vlcerateth the corrupt fleshe, but also 
wastfully consumeth the sound with dayly 
[/34./] 
encreasing, it is the~ called Depascens. 
All the Phisitions of Grece, (Galene also 
witnessing) doe call this affect [^GREEK OMITTED^], because 
[/35./] 
it was wonte to feede and carrie to 
the sound partes, the corruption of the affected, 
and to the affected, that which was 
in the sounde. Whose species or kinde is 
Phagedena, which is an ambulatiue Ulcer, 
[/36./] 
which creping here & there in y=e= skin 
and subiect fleshe, doth corrode and feede 
on the toppe or outward partes, but it neuer 
perseth inwardly. Wherefore it hath 
to name also Vlcus, in su~mo recidens, & 
neuer Profundum. That Ulcer withe 
Galene is called Sordidum, whiche hath 
more grosse & viscous excrementes, which 
[/37./] 
we call Sordem, but in Greke Rhyparon: 
[^f.11r^] 
but the later writers haue otherwyse defined 
it, affirming that it hath certaine 
crustes thicke and grosse, or (as they saye) 
some fleshe softe, thicke and superfluous. 
 
The vlcer named Putridum, is that from 
[/38./] 
whence some vaporouse & euill smelling 
fumes do procede like to dead carcases, or 
to that whiche putrefieth and corrupteth 
the fleshe, hauing euermore thereto annexed 
Sorditiem, with outward heate, superfluous 
humiditie, and ofttimes a feuer, 
and differinge from the filthie vlcer 
by the malice thereof. They call that vlcer 
[/39./] 
Cauernosum, whose orifice is strict & 
narrowe, but in the bottome larger, without 
sense hidde, and hauing many corners, 
and like the Cunnie, ru~ning many ways, 
but without callositie or hardenes, but others 
call it co~trarily Cuniculosum. The 
[/40./] 
fistulous vlcer differeth litle from the hollowe 
or cuniculouse vlcer, but that the 
wynding and turning wayes thereof are 
callouse and harde. The cancrous vlcer is 
[/41./] 
in sight horrible and stinking, hauing edges 
hard, thicke, swelled, and inuersed, 
the colour in the middest betwixt red and 
blacke, as one should say duskie or leadie, 
[^f.11v^] 
and about the vlcered part certaine Veines 
appearing blacke, puft vp, swelled, 
thicke, and replet with blacke bloud. Vlcus 
[/42./] 
discraton, commo~ly called Discrasiatum, 
is that, wherein Quædam discrasia 
(that is inte~perature) reigneth, a certain 
euill qualitie ruling aboue nature, as immoderate 
heate, colde, moisture or drienes, 
or many of them together, and suche 
are properly called among vs Vlcus inte~peratu~. 
[/43./] 
That is called Vlcus crucians, 
or Dolorosum, which in labouring, doth 
cruelly vexe or torment, or (as Guydo a 
Cauliaco sayth) wherein Sense of the co~trarie 
thing is felt. Which may be called 
[/44./] 
in Greke [^GREEK OMITTED^]. That (saith Galen) 
is Vlcus rheumaticum, which by the 
Fluxe and resort of humours, refuse to be 
healed. And that is called Verminosum 
vlcus, which auoideth Wormes, called of 
the Grekes Scolesondes, whose generatio~ 
is putrefact. And those Ulcers, bothe of 
Galene, as also of all the Physitions of 
Grece, are called Cacoethes, who hauing 
[/45./] 
all thinges applied, and eche thing diligentlye 
administred and ordered in all 
pointes according to art, and yet refuseth 
[^f.12r^] 
vtterly to heale, for because that in the 
vlcered or affected parte, some maligne & 
pernitious matter, lieth hidde to vs vnknowen, 
and hindreth the healing of the~: 
Wee call those Ulcers maligne, rebelliouse, 
and hard to be cured. Vlcus varicosum, 
[/46./] 
is that, which hath certaine Ueines 
in partes aboue the Ulcer appearing 
swelled, and replet with thicke & grosse 
bloud, which swelling, is called Varices, 
which by flowing to the said Ulcers, doth 
prohibite and hinder the healing thereof. 
And the Apostumouse Ulcer is y=t=, whiche 
[/47./] 
hath a tumor against nature, proceeding 
of some humour, suche as Phlegmon or 
Erisipelas. All other Ulcers are sufficie~t 
easie to be discried by these aforesaid. 
 
[}The Prognostications or Iudgementes 
of Vlcers.}] 
 
VVHat Ulcers soeuer saith Hippocrates, 
[/48./] 
doe continue the space of a 
yeare or longer, the Orifice must nedes be 
taken awaye, and the Cicatrice made hollowe. 
What Ulcers soeuer (saythe Galene 
(in his Co~mentarie vpon this Aphorisme) 
[^f.12v^] 
are of long continuance, or hauing 
[/49./] 
no Cicatrice by any meanes comming, or 
once receiued, breaketh againe, and yet nothing 
lefte in the curation that ought to 
bee taken awaye, it signifieth Cacoethes, 
whiche is a certaine malignitie, hard to 
receiue curatio~. And y=t= chaunceth through 
the Fluxe of vitious humours, or through 
euill disposition of humors of long tyme 
gathered, and conteined in the member, 
or els some affecte or corruption of the 
bone in that member. (Auicen saith) that 
what Ulcer soeuer, after it be filled with 
Fleshe and a Cicatrice enduced, if it sodainly 
breake fourth againe, it is in daunger 
to degenerate into a Fistula, and Ulcers 
[/50./] 
that be hard, blacke, or greenishe, are 
euill: for in suche there is extinction of y=e= 
[/51./] 
naturall heate in the Ulcered part. Colde 
Ulcers (saith Arabs) are knowen by softnes 
and whytenes. 
 
But the hote Ulcers decline to a rednes, 
[/52./] 
and are eased by cold Medicines, and 
are discerned by feeling. Therfore, euery 
one are knowen, partly by colour, partly 
[/53./] 
by touching, and partly (saith Galene) by 
the sense of the pacient. Some saye they 
[^f.13r^] 
feele a burning, others, a manifest cold in 
the part, and doe take pleasure in hoate or 
colde Medicines. &c. Drie and moiste Ulcers, 
also haue their propre Signes, and 
knowe~ chiefly by feeling. For feeli~g doth 
discerne and iudge drie and moist things, 
and suche as followe those qualities, as 
hardnes and softnes, sharpenes ans lenitie. 
And if maligne Ulcers doe represent 
the colour of the reste of the Bodie. viz. 
[/54./] 
white, purple, duskish or citrine, it sheweth 
some defaulte worthy reproofe in the 
Lieuer, whereby the bloud there engendred 
is corrupted. 
 
Ulcers succeeding other diseases, are 
[/55./] 
harde to be healed. Vlcera circumglabra 
[/56./] 
praua sunt, that is to saye. When thou 
seest about the compasse of the affected 
place, the Heeres to fall away, or Scales 
[/57./] 
to arise, Judge that Ulcer to be peruerse 
and froward, for it signifieth euil humors, 
and maligne iuyce, to flowe to the vlcered 
part, which doe vehemently erode. Therfore 
suche maligne iuyce, doeth neither 
cleane abolishe the rootes of the Heeres, 
nor yet suffer the Ulcered place to receiue 
Cicatrice or Curation. But when those 
[^f.13v^] 
Heeres had fallen before, do spring anew 
about y=e= Ulcer, it is a good toke~ or signe. 
The Ulcer (sayth Hipocrates) whether 
[/58./] 
it come before the disease, or in the sickenes, 
ought diligently to be looked vpon, 
for if the sicke shall die, the Ulcer will be 
drie, blacke, or very pale before death. 
 
Ulcers wherein (after long emission of 
Sanies, and Virulentia) perfect and laudable 
pus beginneth to appeare, is a good 
signe, for it signifieth both strength of nature, 
and obedience of the matter. What 
are the signes of good Pus, is before spoken 
of. 
 
Ulcers in y=e= outward muscles of y=e= back, 
[/59./] 
legges, or armes, are not without daunger. 
Uerie perillous are they deemed also 
which occupie the inwarde members, 
or reache vnto them. In what Ulcers soeuer 
[/60./] 
incarnatiue medicines be applied, before 
they be well mundified: euill and superfluous 
Fleshe will in them encrease. 
But contrarily, which soeuer be duely, & 
as they ought to be mundified and made, 
(as it were) drie before, the Fleshe in such 
(sayth Hippocrates) can neuer encrease 
superfluously, vnlesse contusion happen 
[^f.14r^] 
therto. Ulcers rounde in compasse, are 
[/61./] 
wont to be the worste, and not to come to 
a Cicatrice, but difficultly and with much 
businesse, they bring childre~ to vtter ruine: 
Therefore in such, the Chyrurgians counsell 
ought to applye a Cauterie actuall, 
made after the quantitie and fashio~ of the 
Ulcer compassed. In the outward members, 
[/62./] 
that is to say, in the handes, feet. &c. 
Ulcers and Tumors against nature, as 
Phlegmon and suche like, doe ofte happen, 
and commonly in the Glandulouse 
partes, especially in those bodies that bee 
Plethoriques, that is, geuen to much repletion, 
for these partes, for as muche as 
they be rare, are easie and (as it were) readie 
to receiue euery humor flowing. For 
so it commeth to passe, that through an 
Ulcer, either in the finger of the hand, or 
Foote, the Kernels about the armeholes 
or priuie partes, doe also swell or receiue 
inflammatio~, for when the bloud floweth, 
or other humours should haue recourse 
to the outward partes, straight by their 
losenes and raritie, part of the saide flowinges 
are in them reteined, sometime also 
[/63./] 
the glandulouse partes of the neck (either 
[^f.14v^] 
by Ulcers of the head, or partes nighe to 
them, or els in them selues) do swel. And 
Galene calleth these glandulouse partes, 
which in that order doe swell, Bubones. 
[/64./] 
 
When medicines applied to Ulcers, do 
[/65./] 
profite, or (at least) doe no hurt or discommoditie: 
[/66./] 
it is a sure argument, that such 
medicines were rightly administred. But 
if they cause any present hurt, or do make 
the Ulcer more drie, hote, or colde, it is a 
token that the things ministred are not fit 
for that present griefe, for that thinges 
more drie or more moiste (as the thing requireth) 
should be applied. 
 
Also if (by the thinges applied) the Ulcer 
become more softe by & by, vse things 
[/67./] 
more astringent. Neuerthelesse, if the Ulcer 
doe erode and become more depe, then 
beware diligently, for that springeth of 
sharpe and vicious iuyce together with 
malignitie of the Ulcer, els through the 
facultie of medicines applied, whiche doe 
[/68./] 
more then sufficiently mundifie: for suche 
by arroding the vlcered part, do increase 
muche Sanies, and make the Ulcer verie 
moist, whereby it happeneth that vnskilfull 
Chyrurgians, are so ofte deceiued in 
[^f.15r^] 
their purpose, for thinking the Ulcer to 
be Cacoethes, that is, that y=e= matter therin 
co~teined to procede of malignitie, or (as 
they terme it) of virulent and superfluous 
humiditie, and whyle they earnestly minister 
thinges sharpelye to mundifie, and 
thereby maketh not onely the Ulcer more 
depe, and hollowe, but also more hote, & 
sometyme maketh it Phlegmonodes. 
 
Hereby the parties affected, doe feele erosion 
and mordication. Furthermore, amongest 
many thinges which hurt or hinder 
Ulcers, sayth Guydo de Cauliaco, y=e= 
[/69./] 
South wynde is vnprofitable, and also a 
moist aire ioyned with heat. For they induce 
putrefaction in Ulcers, euen as all 
things that putrefie, procede of heat and 
moisture. Hence co~meth it (saith he) that 
Ulcers of the Legges, are harder & difficulter 
to be cured in y=e= South parts the~ 
in the North, but in wounds of the head, 
it is contrarie. And euen as many tokens 
and iudgementes in woundes, are co~mon 
to Ulcers, so likewyse the iudgementes 
of Ulcers, whereof we nowe speake, may 
bee to woundes compared. Wherefore 
whatsoeuer is spoken before in the iudgementes 
[^f.15v^] 
of woundes conuenient, or agreeing 
to Ulcers, reuoke them in this place. 
 
[}Of the curing of Vlcers in 
generall.}] 
 
IN the curatio~ of Ulcers, there are two 
[/70./] 
thinges to bee considered and propounded 
vnto vs, that is, the contemplation of 
the Ulcer it selfe, by what meanes it is 
an Ulcer, with consideration of the cause 
of the Ulcer, of the Accidentes, and euery 
disposition therein co~teined, as also what 
parte here or there it occupieth. For euery 
Ulcer (as we haue saide before) either is 
alone and by him selfe (that is, hauing no 
other affect, neither conuersaunt with it, 
neither going afore, nor following it) or 
els is ioyned with one or moe, of whiche 
some haue not onely stirred vp the Ulcer 
fro~ the beginning, but also do now make 
it greater. Others be of y=t= sorte, without 
the which it can not obtaine the reason of 
the scope of curation. But euery Ulcer, in 
that it is an Ulcer, hath some common indication 
[/71./] 
of the cure (eue~ as Galene saith) 
the way of healing Ulcers, is by a meane 
[^f.16r^] 
drying: this indication also is common to 
woundes, if (at least they be wou~des) that 
is, receiued of some stripe. This onely is 
their difference, this nedeth lesse: and the 
other (through the great humiditie) requireth 
greater desiccation: If the Ulcer 
be ioyned with any other affect, curation 
ought not to be applied to the Ulcer, but 
first to cure the affect, & lastly the Ulcer. 
For whether Phlegmon, Erisepelas, or y=e= 
tumor called Oedema, or blackenes, or 
Ecchimosis, do besiege the Ulcered part, 
the cure must be gentle. But if there be 
some strong intemperature (whiche is 
wont to bringe weakenes to the affected 
part) and be ioyned to the Ulcered fleshe, 
then, that is first to be cured. And when 
thou hast cured the intemperature, afterwarde 
thou shalt easely heale the affecte. 
So must we first helpe the tumors called 
Varices, whiche are ofte aboue the Ulcered 
place, and then to cure the Ulcer. But 
none of these curations (saieth Galene) is 
of the Ulcer it selfe, but of some other affect, 
whiche either maketh the Ulcer or 
nourisheth it. Furthermore, Galene affirmeth 
[/72./] 
that in taking away the dispositions 
[^f.16v^] 
co~tained in Ulcers, there are two things 
to be considered: that is to saye, either vtterly 
to take awaye suche like affectes in 
the body, or els to destroye that which is 
therein vnprofitably conteined. But this 
he meaneth to be done where affect is little 
and playne, for where it is great, it can 
not be brought to a Cicatrice before, till 
the other affectes haue remedie. Of suche 
[/73./] 
like Ulcers therfore as are ioyned with 
other affectes or dispositions, there bee 
foure particuler wayes of curation. 
1 The first prescribeth a co~uenient diet 
fit for the curation of suche Ulcers. 
2 The seconde is to diuerte the matter 
antecedent. 
3 Thirdly, in correcting and remouing 
the accidentes and dispositio~s ioyned with 
the Ulcer. 
4 Fourthly, those accidentes being corrected, 
doth teache and instruct vs to cure 
them after the maner of hollowe wou~ds. 
 
But we doe follow the first and second 
intention, both by amending, emptying, 
diuerting and preuenting that same flowing, 
wherewith the bodie of the affected, 
doth abounde, and flowe in the vlcered 
[^f.17r^] 
part. Furthermore, the wayes whereby 
we may aptlye amende and diuert the abundaunce 
of humors, & take away their 
corruption is thus. viz. by Phlebotomie, 
Purgation, Approued diet, Cauterie potentiall, 
Uomiting & others of that sort. 
We preuent flowinges with binding, washings, 
epithmes, ointments Ex bolo armeno, 
and other restrictiues. When as 
therefore the humour flowing in the Ulcered 
places, is neither more, nor yet 
much worse then co~uenient, sufficient repercussiues, 
& binding aboue the Ulcered 
place shall suffice, & whiche binding doth 
shut the pores wherby the matter should 
flowe into the Ulcer: it is meete therfore 
that the medicines applied to suche Ulcers, 
be more drie then they that serue for 
the simple Ulcer. But if it happen that 
this flowing can not be stayed or kept vnder, 
the cause the~ must be searched foorth, 
and that must first be taken away, whiche 
if it come by weakenes of the parte that 
receiueth it, it must be strengthened with 
proper curation of the vlcered place. But 
if it come by abundaunce of bloud or euill 
humors, either in the whole Bodies, or in 
[^f.17v^] 
any of the partes, they are first to be cured 
but the imbecillitie of the part, whereto 
by reason thereof more of humors then is 
conuenient doth resort, doth come altogether 
of intemperature, notwithstanding, 
not of euery intemperature. Whereupon 
it commeth to passe, that the vlcered flesh 
is ofttimes only temperate & not weake, 
and ofttimes both vnte~perate & weake, 
for strong inte~perature bringeth weakenes 
to the affected part. 
 
The thirde and last intention, which is 
in amending and taking awaye the accidentes 
and dispositions, ioyned with the 
Ulcer, is brought to passe by due consideration 
of the qualities of the 
humors and nature of the 
affected part. 
 
[^f.18r^] 
[}The Seconde part.

with corrosion. And then profiteth 
publique medicines, as Succus Plantaginis,

A Cataplasme also is commodious, 
made with Mallowes, Plantaine, and

[}Of an Vlcer vvith a tumor.}] 
 
IF with the Ulcer through paine, a tumor 
[/84/] 
do chau~ce, it must be asswaged, (y=e= 
cause of pain considered) whether it come 
by dissolutio~ of co~tinuitie or with biting,

belly (respecting the humors nature) vse 
Phlebotomie, restraine y=e= humor flowing, 
and resolue that which is already flowed) 
which all must be considered in tumors against 
nature. If the tumor proceede of

spoken sufficiently in the Ulcer with tumor. 
This only refleth, that the Ulcer can 
not be cured till the tumor in the veines 
be taken away with often bathinges, and 
[^f.23r^]

taken away with the accide~tes aforesaid, 
either it will cure it selfe, or els receiue

[}Of the Vlcer vvith putrefaction

IF in an Ulcer the Boone be also putrefied, 
[/94/] 
the Boone is firste to bee bared by 
corrosiues, or other wyse as is aforsayd, & 
so much of the boone as is corrupted must 
be taken awaye, till the Boone appeare

Neverthelesse if the Boone be greatly 
corrupted, nothing can be better therefore 
then Cauterie, for safely and speedely it 
drieth both the bottome and toppe. Notwithstanding, 
[/95/] 
so order the heate of the 
Iron, that it serue aptly, both for y=e= depth 
and quantitie of the Boone corrupted, for 
we haue seene that to hotte and vehement 
[^f.24r^] 
cauteries, expelleth not so sone the Boone 
corrupted, but haue spoyled it with corruption. 
But if the corruption lye yet 
deepe, after thuse of your first cautery (to 
the ende it may be more easely auoyded) 
to make the Boone sounde and whole, it 
[/96/] 
shalbe moste expedient to pearse it with 
many holes, vntill some bloud appeare, & 
in those holes to applie a cauterie, by 
meanes whereof, the Boone may be very 
well dried. Or els fill them with Aqua 
forti, to shall the Boone be dried, and by 
litle and litle, expell that is corrupted. 
And under that shall nature incarnate 
[/97/] 
fleshe, to preserue the sounde Boone from 
the corruption of outward aire. To conclude, 
the Boone corrupted shalbe excluded, 
and none, or very litle humor shall folowe 
it. After the Cauterie hath bene applied 
the three first dayes, and the Escar 
remoued, the~ good it is to powre into the 
Ulcer Ol. Ros. cum Oui albumine, and 
the three dayes following, vse a digestiue

[}Of the malignaunt Vlcer called 
Cacoethes.}] 
 
IN curing these kyndes of Ulcers, the 
[/98/] 
causes must first be diligently searched, 
to witte whether it be Plethora, Cacochymia, 
or Cachexia, els an vniuersall intemperature, 
or of some inward part, as 
[^f.25v^] 
the Liuer, Splene, Uentricle, Ulcered 
part, swelling of the Ueines, hard edges, 
weakenes of the affected part brought to 
passe by euill humors therein heaped, or 
the causes aroresayde. Therefore let vs 
[/99/] 
take awaye the causes according to their 
natures then by diet, Phlebotomie, and 
purgation to suppresse the members intemperate, 
whatsoeuer it be, and in what 
part. As for intemperature, looke before 
in the chapter of the Ulcer with intemperature. 
And commonly in these kinde of 
Ulcers, we haue prescribed to the pacient 
the vse of Guiacum, with happie successe, 
[/100/] 
after the vse of common purgation, but in 
them whose humors and iuyce is profitable, 
a diet is suffient, but if the vlcer seeme 
bathed in humors, it is tyme to restraine 
the~. For the tumors Varices, thou 
hast a proper chap. but for inte~perature of 
the inner partes, take cou~sell of the Physition 
And as touching Ulcers maligne 
[/101/] 
and harde to receiue Cicatrice, the sum 
or chief scope of curation is vehement exiccation 
of the biting humors, whiche is 
brought to passe per repellentia, and discutientia. 
Hauing good respecte to represse 
[^f.26r^] 
th at whiche floweth, and to take away 
that which is infixed. And for this 
purpose these following are moste expedient. 
Aristoloch. Corticis Radi. Caparis. 
Malicorium, Radix Pannacis, Sarcocollæ, 
Vitrum Combustum, Testæ pisciu~ 
Vstæ. All metalles burnte likewyse are 
profitable, as Cadmia, Calchitis vsta, &

But a further respecte must be had to 
[/102/] 
the bodie, for that in some bodies the metalles 
and suche like aforenamed medicines, 
must be washed before they be ministred, 
but in harder bodies, without dau~ger, 
certaine of them may vnwashed bee 
applied, because in suche parties the me~bers
