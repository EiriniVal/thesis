Phœbus who chasith awaye the 
darke and vnconfortable night: 
castinge his goldyne beames on 
my face, woulde not sofer me to 
take anye longer slepe: but said 
awake for shame, & beholde the handy worke of 
our sister Flora, how she hath reuested the earth 
wyth mooste beautyfull colours, meruaylouslye 
set in trees, plantes, herbes, and 
floures: in so muche that the old and wetheryd 
cote of wynter, is quite done away, and put out 
of remembrance. at whiche wordes of Phebus, 
my hart quickened in me, and all desire of slepe 
was eftsones forgotten. Wherfore I am now 
cumme into this beautiful mydowe to recreate 
my selfe, and gather some of those pleasant 
herbes, and floures, whiche here doe growe. 
But let me see? me thinke I perceyue .ij. men 
walkinge to gether and reasonynge also very 
earnestlye. I wyll aproche neerer vnto them, 
perchaunce they be of my acquaintaunce: 
Suerly I shoulde knowe them. I am deceyued 
[^f.1v^] 
yf the one be not my frende maister Gale, and 
the other maister Feilde. It is so in deade. 
Wherfore I will go and salute them. God that 
hath brought vs together in to this place, make 
this daye prosperous and fortunate vnto you 
both. 
 
[}Tho. Gale,}] Brother Yates the same we wishe 
vnto you, & you are welcome into our co~pany. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] This faire and plesant mornynge, 
will not soffer maister Yates to 
kepe his bed: but leuynge the citye, he rometh 
the feildes, to espie oute some strange herbes, 
vnto hym yet vnknowen. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] I muste of force confesse, that you 
doe hitte the nayle on the heade: but sence my 
happe is so fortunate, as to mete wyth you 
both, and that nowe in this pleasant mornyng: 
I wolde leaue of my former determinyd purpose, 
and require you to enter into some 
talke of Chirurgerye. For sens you both ware 
brought vppe vnder Maister Ferris (beinge 
nowe Sergeant Cherurgian, vnto the Quenes 
Maiestie) one at whome bothe for his knowledge, 
& experience, you dyd not a lytle profite: 
and also that you haue had longe practise your 
selues: you shoulde meruaylouslye pleasure 
me, and profit other. for so may it come to passe, 
that it myghte be in the place of an Institution 
vnto those that shall here after desire the knowledge 
[^f.2r^] 
of Chirurgerye. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Your request is honest, and reasonable: 
and therfore not to denyed. 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] We ware abought the like thinge 
when as you saluted vs, wherfore renewyng 
out first talke, we will accomplishe your desire. 
 
[}Iohn Yates,}] I haue redde manye authour in 
Chirurgerie, and yet finde small profit by them. 
 
[}Thomas Gale.}] What be the names of youre 
authours. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Theodoricus, Brunus, Lanfrancus, 
Rolandus, Rogerus, Bartilpalia, Wwilhelmus, 
Guido, Brunsvvicke, and Vigo. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] What parte of Hippocrates, 
Galene, Auicenne, Paulus, Rhasis, Albucasis, 
and Haliabbas, haue you rede? theis be of greter 
authoritie, and of whom you shal learne sounde 
doctrine. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Wyth theis I haue not ben much 
acquaynted. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Well, then the nexte waye is that 
you do put oute suche questions as you wolde 
haue answered, and stande in doute: and also 
answere to that which shalbe demaunded. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] right gladly, for ther is no waye 
by whyche I shall so muche, and in so shorte a 
tyme profit. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Truth it is, wherfore let vs begin 
[^f.2v^] 
wyth out further detractynge of tyme. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] The seyng our talke shal wholly 
be the institution of a Chirurgian, it ware 
mete, and conuenient first to vnderstande what 
Chirurgery is. Wherfore answere me I pray 
you, what call you Chirurgirie? 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Guido de Cauliaco (in his boke 
which he calleth his Collectorie) defineth it in 
this sorte. Chirurgirie is a parte of terapentike 
helinge men by insition, vstion, & articulation. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Those wordes, are taken out of 
a booke ascribyd to Galen, beinge intituled 
Introductio, seu Medicus. But he should not 
haue called it corruptly terapenticke, but therapeuticke. 
For Therapeuticon is that part of phisicke, 
which curyth. this part consisteth eyther in 
curyng by conuenient diet: eyther by medicyne: 
or els by outwarde vse of the ha~de. there Galen 
(or he that was author of the booke aboue said) 
affirmeth howe y=t= which healith by the hande, is 
a portion of the curatiue parte. this helpeth men 
by incisions, vstions, and reducinge the bones 
into their naturall seate. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Yet this is no perfect definitio~ of 
Chirurgerie, because the definition doth not 
contayne in it so muche, as to Chirurgerie is 
required. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then you shall here an other definition 
[^f.3r^] 
out of Guido. He saith that Chirurgery 
is sayde of this greke word Ciros, whiche 
signifieth an hand: and Gyos that is worke, or 
operation: as who sholdd saye, Chirurgerie is 
the science of workynge by the hand: how like 
you this definition? 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Worse then the other, both for 
y=t= it is no definition, but only the signification of 
the name: and also for that Ciros and Gyos, be 
no greke wordes, which shoulde showe, that 
eyther Guido was no grecian, or els that his 
workes are corruptyd. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Truth it is, for Chirurgia, is deriuid 
Apo tes cheiros cai tou ergou, but both 
the description of Chirurgerie, & also the Etymologie 
& signification of the name, doth right 
wel showe what Chirurgerye is: although it 
be no answere to our demaunde. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then I pray you let me learne 
at your handes, what ys the trew and essentiall 
definition of Chirurgerye. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Right gladly. Galene in his boke 
of medicinall definitions, sayth that Chirurgerye 
is the quicke and redy motion of stedfast 
handes with experience: or an artificiall 
action in phisicke, done by the handes: wherby 
is obteyned the desiered scope. So that you may 
by theis wordes hether to aledgyd out of the introduction, 
and the booke of medicinall definitions, 
[^f.3v^] 
forme a definition on his wyse, Chirurgery 
is the arte, whiche curyth those infirmities, 
& grefes of mans body, whiche are to 
be done by right vse, and application of the 
hande. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] In this definition is to be notyd, 
that Chirurgery doth not cure al greifes which 
require helpe of the hande: but onlye suche as 
are curable. Also it is to be vnderstande, 
though in the definition is put no other wayes 
of curynge those grefes, but by the right vse of 
the hande, yet Chirurgerie hath nede both of 
that parte whiche curith by dyet, and of that 
whiche helpeth by medycine. As is moost euident 
& clere in great inflammations, & also in 
those bodyes in whiche Cacochimia (that is to 
say yll Iuse) is found, where the humours are 
defilyd and corruptyd. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then it sholde seme that Chirurgery 
is so ioyned to the other two partes, that it 
can not be well seperatyd from them: although 
they be now two distincte artes. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Truth it is, and in the begynnynge, 
phisicke and Chirurgery ware both one: 
& one man exercised both, for so did the princes 
of phisicke Hippocrates and Galene. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then I perceyue that Chirurgerie 
is not so base, as it is taken for: and that 
it is of great antiquitie, beinge the most auncient 
[^f.4r^] 
parte of phisicke, and was exercisyd of 
Emperours, Kynges, Philosophers, and Phisicians. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] The basenes of it, and eke smal 
estimation, comyth of the vnleterrid and rude 
Emperikes: who takyth on them the office of 
a Chirurgian, whan as they knowe nothynge 
lesse, then what Chirurgery meaneth. but as 
touching the antiquitie of Chirurgery, you shal 
not beleaue vs, but regarde the wordes of Cornelius 
Celsus (whiche are written in his .vij. 
booke) who sayth. Hæc pars cum fit vetustissima, 
magis tamen ab illo parente omnis 
Medicinæ Hippocrate, quam a prioribus, 
exculta est. This part of Phisicke (saith Celsus 
beinge the most auncient, yet it was more increasyd 
by Hippocrates (the father of all Phisicke) 
then of al those that ware before his time. 
Here you maye perceyue, that it is the most 
auncient and eldyst part. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] The same Celsus also setteth oute 
certayne noble persons who daylye more, and 
more, did augment the art, for it did florishe 
in AEgypte by reason that Philoxenus dyd 
exercise it. Also Gorgias, Sostratus, Hieron, 
the tvvo Apollonij, & Hammonius of Alexander. 
At Rome also Tryphon and Euelpistius, 
and Neges ware ryght excellent in Chirurgerie: 
[^f.4v^] 
and by there lerned workes, dyd cause 
the arte not a litle to florishe. Podalirius, and 
Machaon (the sonnes of AEsculapius) being 
vvith Agamemnon, in the Troian warres, 
cured the woundyd Soudiours: as Homere 
the Greke Poet affirmeth. 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] All theis as you say ware right excellent 
in Chirurgery: and famous also, chefely 
for curing of woundes, and vlcers. In like sorte, 
was Chiron Centaurus, and Achilles, wyth 
diuers other. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Seynge that I haue learned 
that Chirurgery is the .iij. parte therapeutike, 
what Chirurgiry also is, of the antiquitie, & authors 
of the same: I wold gladly vnderstande of 
howe many partes it doeth consist & stande on. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] It hath .ij. partes: the one called 
Theorike, conteynynge the speculation and 
knowledge, the other Practike, whiche is the 
manuall operation and exercise. The theorike 
parte, is obteyned by demonstration, and exacte 
knowledge of the principles of the arte, and 
this, both doth inuente, and teache what is to 
be done, whiche way, and also by what meanes. 
This parte a man maye perfectlye knowe, although 
he neuer doeth exercise any portion of 
the practike. the practicke parte is founde oute 
and inuentyd by reason and experience, and it 
[^f.5r^] 
doeth rightly, and redelye exercise the same 
thinges, that the Theorike hath inuentyd. 
This parte no man can exactly obtaine, excepte 
that both he doeth se other whiche are skylfull 
in the arte to worke: and also diligentlye exerseth 
it him selfe euer bearing firmely in minde, 
both what he haue sene of other men brought 
to good ende, and what he haue also done hym 
selfe. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then seinge that you haue vttered 
vnto me howe manye partes of Chirurgirye 
ther are: I pray you first beginne wyth 
the Teorike parte of it, and let me vnderstande 
exactlye what it is, and that beinge finishyd, 
procede to the practicke. 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] To set out the theorike it wyll by 
profitable: but as touchyng the practicke it ware 
both superfluous & vayne, seyng y=t= the perfite curing 
of apostemes, & tumours, are set out in the 
boke of tumoures against nature, also the true 
& exacte cure of vlcers, is at large opened in an 
other worke, whose title is a perfecte and exacte 
methode of curynge vlcers. Furthermore the 
practise of healing wounds both in similer & instrumentall 
partes, also of fractures, and luxations: 
you shall fynde in his Enchiridion of 
Chirurgerie. And as touching wounds made 
wyth the common gonpouder and pellet, you 
shall receyue the trew and methodicall cure, 
[^f.5v^] 
in a tretise berynge name of curynge woundes 
made wyth gonshotte, in whiche treatise is set 
out, and also manifestlye confuteted, the grose 
and fonde errours not onlye of Iohn Vigo, 
Alfonce Ferrius, and Hier. Brunvvicke (which 
make the shote venemous, and consequentlye 
the wounde therewyth made, and so the cure 
to be lyke as is in venemous woundes:) but 
also by demo~stration he ouertroweth al those, 
that be of that opinion. So that for the practicke 
parte, I do not se what is more to be desired: 
excepte it ware some treatise, in whiche might 
be comprehended the arte of phlebotomie or lettynge 
of blode, and also of scarification, and boxinge 
whiche I hope (God grauntynge hym 
lyfe) he wyll hereafter fit out. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Theis be a numbre of worthye 
bookes, whiche do contayne the practise of so 
worthye an arte. God graunt you longe lyfe 
maister Gale, to accomplishe that you haue yet 
behinde. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Although some perchaunce more 
busie then lerned: and yet more lerned, then discrete 
and modeste, and yet parhappes more destrete 
& modest, then a fauour of those that trauayleth 
for the profit, and vtilitie of other: haue 
not a litle lifted vp the groyne, & bent the brow, 
& with manifest wordes of contumelie rewarded 
me: yet the loue of my countrye, and desire 
[^f.6r^] 
to profyt those of my profession: shall euer be a 
sufficient spurre, to prouoke me to continue as 
I haue begonne, for trew it is that the Poet 
Pertius writeth. 
 
Fœlix a tergo quem nulla Ciconia pinxit. 
 
Whiche maye ryghte well be englyshed, althoughe 
not verbatim yet in meanynge on this 
or lyke sorte. 
 
O happie man that such happe hast, 
Thy path to treade so right: 
That no serpentyne tungue vvyll carpe, 
Or longbild Storke eke Spite. 
 
But returne we to that, from whence we 
are somewhat digressed. our talke, and communication 
at thys presente shall not further 
extende then to institute the Chirurgian in 
the theoricke parte of hys arte. Wherefore 
sence you haue learned what Chirurgerie 
is, wyth dyuers other apte, and nedefull 
thynges: it dothe behoue you to knowe the 
subiecte of Chirurgerye. For all Artistes and 
workemen haue their subiectes, and matter 
on whyche they doe exercise there arte. So 
the Mason hathe stones, and bryckes, whyche 
accordynge to hys arte, he heweth, squareth, 
cutteth, & proportioneth. In lyke sorte dothe 
[^f.6v^] 
the Carpenter wyth Woode, and Tymber 
and the Smyth wyth yron. All whyche be 
accompted subiectes to these artes. And yf 
the Mason Carpenter and Smythe, be so curious 
and dilygent, in knowyng, chosyng, and 
consyderynge of stones, tymber, and yron, 
whyche be thynges of no great valour or estimation: 
howe muche more then behoueth it 
the Chirurgian to knowe what the subiecte 
is on whyche he must exercise his arte? 
Iohn Yates. You haue ryghtlye sayd, and by 
these your wordes I gather, that the subiecte 
to the arte of Chirurgirie, is that whyche is 
to Physike: I meane mans bodye beyng apt 
aswell to sycknes and infyrmities, as also to 
health. 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] You haue ryghtlye aunswered, 
but thys is not sufficient to aunswere that 
mans bodye is that stone, tymber, yrone and 
matter whereon the Chirurgian muste exercise 
hys arte: excepte you also doe knowe 
the partes of mans bodye, there situation, 
nature, and office. as of bones, cartilagies 
ligamentes, Nerues, vaynes, arteries, muscles, 
fleshe, and skynne. For I thynke no 
man is so rude but doth consider, that wythoute 
the perfect knowledge of these, how easely 
he shall fall into intollorable errours, especiallye 
in phlebotomye, in fractures, and luxations, 
[^f.7r^] 
and where as occasion is offered to 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ke incision. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] The more I here you two speake 
of Chirurgirye, the further me thynke I 
fynde my selfe from the knowledge thereof. 
And so much the rather, that by your wordes 
I gather howe that the subiecte and matter 
of Chirurgerye (beynge the bodye of man) 
cannot be fully knowen, wythout the exercise 
of the Anotomye. Wherefore I cannot 
a lytle meruayle at some, who beynge Chirurgians 
in name, doe not onlye neglecte thys 
knowledge of Anotomye: but also Inuieth 
those that doe therein trauayle. 
 
[}Tho Gale.}] Wel let such go wyth there wilfull 
blindnes, & obstinate ignorance, and let vs 
nowe consider what the ende of Chirurgery is. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] I suppose that maister Yates 
knoweth that the ende or intention of Chirurgery, 
is to heale all suche curable infirmities, 
as are to be cured by the office and dewe administration 
of the hande. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] I render to you both harty 
thankes, for that by your talke I haue learned 
what Chirurgiry is, the antiquitie of it, & noble 
authours that did professe it, of howe manye 
parts it doth consiste on, also what is the subiect 
or matter on whych the Chirurgian doth exercyse 
his art, and what is the ende or final intention 
[^f.7v^] 
of Chirurgerye: nowe I wyll further 
desyre you to showe me the waye to procede 
in lernynge and obteyning thys noble and 
famous arte. 
 
[}Thomas Gale.}] Before we set oute the 
waye howe to attayne the knowlege of Chirurgerie, 
it is conuenient to showe what maner 
a man a Chirurgian shoulde be whome 
we shoulde instructe in this arte. For manifest 
it is, that all men are not to be admitted 
vnto thys mysterye. 
 
[}Iohn Feild:}] Truthe it is for accordynge 
to the prouerbe. The diuell made a souter a 
shypman. signifying here by that nature repugning 
all thynge is in vayne Howe vnapte and 
vnfyte thynke you, is a swyne to be taughte to 
hunte: suerly as vnapt, as a hounde is apte & 
fytte: but in the admission of one to learne oure 
arte, is to be noted the gyftes of nature, & also 
education from hys infancye. For yf men exercising 
artes of lesse estimation and pryce, doe 
with dilygent care chose suche as are fytte for 
their facultye & arte: howe much more oughte 
he Chirurgian so to doe? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] It is suerly so and the gyftes 
of nature required in hym that shoulde be a Chirurgian 
Cornelius Celsus doth name to be 
these. He must be a yonge man, hauyng a sure 
[^f.8r^] 
& stedfast hand, voyde of trimblyng, and that he 
hath the vse of the lefte hande, as well as of the 
ryghte, a sharpe and quicke slighte, one 
voyde of all feare, wythoute folyshe pitie: so 
that he be no moued anye thynge by the 
clamor and noyse of the patient. but minding 
to cure hym, whom he taketh in hande, he 
shall neyther haste more then is meete, or yet 
make lesse incision then is requisite. Hippocrates 
in a booke intituled Lex Hippocrates, speaketh 
of hym that shall learne Phisycke in thys 
sorte. Quisquis enim medicam scientiam 
vere sibi comparare volit, hijs Ducibus, voti 
sui compos fiet. Natura, Eruditione, Loco 
studiis apto, Institutione a puerita, Industria 
& tempore. Primo nanque omnium, natura 
est opus. Hac etenim repugnante vrita fiunt 
omnia. at si ad optima viam natura demo~stret, 
artis eruditio facile eueniet: quam quidem 
prudentia sibi comparet oportet, ita vt ab 
ipsa pueritia institutio accedat, atque hoc in 
loco disciplinis quidem conuenienti. Preterea 
operam sedulo nauare oportet: eamque 
ad longum certe tempus, quo ipsa iam infinita 
disciplina, fœliciter satis, & cum profectu 
fructus suos ferat. Who so euer (sayth Hippocrates) 
wyll learne the arte of Phisycke, 
[^f.8v^] 
folowyng these guides he shal haue hys desire. 
Nature, learnyng, an apte place for stodye, 
good bryngyng vppe from the chyldhoode, diligence, 
and tyme. For fyrst of all nature is to 
be looked for. For nature repugnynge, all 
thynges are frustrat. But yf that nature be 
inclyned vnto the best thynges, the knoweledge 
of the arte wyll easely folowe, whyche 
it behoueth to get throughe prudence, so that 
from the chyldehoode he be well trayned vppe, 
and that in a place apt for stodye. further more 
he muste bestowe greate dilygence, and that 
for a longe tyme, so that learnynge (beynge 
nowe grafted in hym) maye happelye, and 
that wyth increase brynge forthe her fruites. 
And Hippocrates resembleth the stody of Phisycke 
vnto agriculture or tyllage. For (saythe 
he) what consyderation is of those thynges 
whyche the earth bryngeth out, the lyke in all 
poyntes is of the knowledge of Phisycke. For 
our nature is as it ware the feilde, the disciplynes 
of teachers, are like the seades: also the institution 
and bringynge vp from the childhode, 
is resembled to the castynge of seade into the 
grounde in dewe and conuenient tyme, the 
place in whyche he must learne, is as it were 
the ayre gyuinge norishment to suche thyngs, 
as sprynge oute of the grouude. The industrie 
& diligence bestowed in the art, is lyke the 
[^f.9r^] 
tyllage of the plowman, and laste of all, tyme 
dothe strengthen these, and suffereth them 
perfectlye to be norished. And of thys tyme 
speaketh also the poet. 
 
Assiduo illisu durum cauat Vndula Saxum. 
 
The vvatry droppes, so moyst and Softe 
Doth pearse harde Stones vvith falling ofte. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] If thys shoulde be obserued amonge 
phisicians, I doe not doubt but their 
shoulde be more famous men among vs, and 
fewer rude and bussardlye Emperickes: but 
thys toucheth nothing the Chirurgian. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] As muche as the Phisician, 
for doe you not remember, that Hippocrates 
comprehended Chirurgirye vnder Physicke 
beynge one portion of the curatiue parte? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Also as touchynge education 
Hyppocrates in hys booke called De Medico. 
would haye a Chirurgian folow the warres. 
For he speakyng of the other partes of Physycke 
saythe. Nexte is the Chirurgerye of 
woundes receyued in the warres, and extraction 
of dartes and thynges in them fyxed. For 
seldome cyuill and instestine diuisions chaunce 
in all tymes, yet in externe and outwarde 
warres, these chaunce moste commonlye. 
[^f.9v^] 
Wherefore he that wyl vse thys Chirurgery, 
it behoueth hym to frequent the warres, and 
folowe outwarde armyes, and hostes of men. 
For so shall he be exercised for that necessitye 
and vse. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] In dede so dyd Podalirius, 
Machaon, and Achilles, wyth other more 
of whom mention is made. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Yea but many Chirurgians 
wyll not occupye themselues in learnyng those 
partes of whyche they haue daylye exercise. 
Muche lesse then couit to folowe the warres, 
they haue not suche a burnynge zeale vnto 
their arte. 
 
[}Thomas Gale.}] The more pitye, not 
for their cause, but for the common weales. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] If all these pointes are required 
in him that shoulde be a Chirurgian 
(as I must confesse they are) howe happeneth 
it, that their are an infinite number of Chirurgians 
in name, whyche haue scarse one 
of these fornamed, gyftes. And yf they haue 
any, it is boldnes, for that wanteth not in 
them, they are as boulde, as blynde bayerd. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Yea but where Celsus praiseth 
bouldnes in a Chirurgian, he meaneth 
the vertue called fortitude, which where as 
necessytie doth reqnire, is not moued wyth 
[^f.10r^] 
the teares, countenaunce, and clamor ether 
of the pacient or of the standers by: but 
myndynge the health of the sycke, according 
to arte maketh incision, and doth suche lyke 
thynges. 
 
[}Thomas Gale.}] And to aunswer you, why 
their are suche a sorte of rude Emperickes yea 
Hosiers, Taylours, fletchers, Minstrales, Souters, 
Iogelers, wiches, baudes, and to conclude 
(an infinite number whyche hertofore 
ware prohibited the exercise of thys arte) suche 
as other wyse cannot get anye lyuynge: is for 
that Chirurgerie is nowe, as it was in the 
tyme of Hippocrates. Who sayth that other 
artes are not exercised wythout lawes, and 
penalties: but Chirurgerye is free for all persons, 
the more is the pitye, when as so muche 
hurte and damage doe daylye spryng, through 
the abuse of so noble an arte. so that I am more 
then halfe perswaded, that Chirurgerye wyll 
hardlye, or neuer gather strength agayne, and 
florishe: excepte the prynce hauinge compassion 
of poore deplorated Chirurgerye, doth by 
vertue of lawes driue awaye from her, theis 
here forenamed enemyes. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] But yet I doe meruayle at 
those, whyche are as it were Chirurgians by 
profession, knowynge them selues voyde of a 
number of the poyntes required in a Chirurgian, 
[^f.10v^] 
that for loue to their contrye, and conscience 
sake: they wil not yet at the leaste chose 
suche seruantes, as had some of the fornamed 
vertues. Whyche yf they dyd, their were yet 
some hope that Chirurgirie shoulde hereafter 
floryshe. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Their aunswere is, that 
when the skey fall we hall haue larkes. 
They thynke that they shoulde not haue seruantes 
to serue in that vocation. For few say 
they, that haue well brough vp there sonne, 
will put hym to the arte, because it is accounted 
so beggerly, and vile. Wher as in deade if 
for a season they woulde take the more paynes 
them selues, & admitte none, but such as shuld 
be somwhat meet, there wolde be a nombre 
glade to studye the art, because it woulde come 
to estimation, and be a worshipfull lyuynge to 
the professer. But shall I shewe you what I 
thynke is the chefe cause: science hath no greater 
enymie, then Ignorance, and also the prouerbe 
is trew, like wil alway to the like, and 
hereof comith it, that suche carpenter suche 
chippes, suche maister suche man. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Yet me thynketh that one 
maye be a good Chirurgian, thoughe he haue 
not all the pointes reconyd of Hippocrates and 
Celsus. As one myght thynke hymselfe ryght 
happye, though he neuer dyd attayne to Aristoteles 
[^f.11r^] 
summum bonum, or Plato his Idaea. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] It is one thyng to say a good 
Chirurgian, and an other to saye an excellent 
Chirurgian. But let that passe, I woulde we 
had good Chirurgians. And because the descriptions 
of Hippocrates and Celsus touching 
what maner a man a Chirurgian should be) 
semeth somwhat to straite to you: I wyll 
showe you what conditions Guido requyreth 
in hym. Not for that I do preferre the authoritie 
of Guido, before suche fathers and parents 
of Chirurgirye, as both Hippocrates and Celsus 
ware, but because perhappes Crassa crassis 
conueniunt magis. Guido requyreth .iiij. 
thinges in hym that is or shoulde be a Chirurrurgian. 
Firste that he shoulde be lettered, 
secondly that he shold be expert, thyrdlye that 
he be ingenious, and last that he be vertuous 
and well maneryd. Theis wordes you shall 
finde in his Collectorie. 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] And as touchyng theis .iiij. 
pointes note first wher Guido sayth he muste 
be lettered, he doth meane he shoulde be lerned, 
and that chefelye in suche doctrine as is in his 
art requisite. That is at the lest, that he can 
wright, red, and vnderstande the mynde of 
latyne authour. If he had knowledge in geometrie 
for makynge his incision, for curynge 
[^f.11v^] 
fractures, and luxations, and also in curinge 
malignant vlcers: knowynge what figure 
woulde mooste spedelye vnite, and Ioyne the 
lyppes of the vlcere: it ware very commendable. 
Naturall Philosophie is a goodlye ornature 
to the Chirurgian, for it showeth hym 
what resulteth whan as there is diuers and 
sondry simples mixed to gether: but I will go 
to the second pointe, he must be experte, that is 
he muste be garnished wyth muche and longe 
experience, whiche is excogitated be firme and 
certayne reasons, and by them also confirmed, 
otherwise he is to be accompted rude, and an 
Empericke, if he hath not reason annexed and 
ioyned to his experience. Thirdlye sayth 
Guido He must be ingenious, vnto whiche 
there are fyue thynges principally required. 
Fyrst is the redye and good conceyuynge: then 
a firme and sure memorye, nexte a sounde and 
ryght iudgement, after a easye callynge thinges 
to mynde whyche he haue harde or sene, 
and laste a lyuelye and sharpe redynes in findynge 
and inuentynge remedyes. The maners 
whyche Guido woulde haue in a Chirurgian 
are reconed of Hippocrates and Celsus, 
whiche briefelye I wyll numbre: they muste 
be bolde and wyth out feare in suche cures as 
are with out peryll, and wheras necessitye requireth. 
Also in cures that be doutful, not to be 
[^f.12r^] 
to raishe and hastie. to be gentle and courtyous 
towarde the sicke pacient, to be frendlye and louyng, 
towarde those of hys profession. Also 
wyse and circunspecte in Prognostications, last 
of all, he muste be chaste and temperate of 
body, mercifull towarde the pore, and not to 
gredy of mony. and this is sufficient touchynge 
the description of hym, that muste be admitted 
in Chirurgerye. Nowe let vs talke of the instrumentes 
wherewith a Chirurgian ought to 
be garnished. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] That is well sayde and of 
those instrumentes I wold gladly haue vnderstandynge. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] And so you shal, & for the suerer 
and sounder doctrine, you must note that instruments 
are said two maner of wayes. for eyther 
thy are medicinal, or els intruments of metal: 
as Iron, leade, tynne, copper, siluer, & golde, y=e= 
medicinal instrume~ts are medicines, as potio~s, 
emplastres, cataplasmes, cerotes, vnguentes, 
oyles, Balmes, trochise, waters, & suche other. 
but principally as touching vnguents the Chirurgian 
(after Guido his minde) ought alwaies 
to haue in redines, v. sundry vnguentes aunswering 
to fiue intentions curatiue of Chirurgirie, 
that is to say: for to suppurate and maturate, 
he must haue Basilicon, to mundifie and 
[^f.12v^] 
clense, Apostolicon. To incarnate and cause 
fleshe to growe, he shall prepare Vnguentum 
Aureum. To conglutinate wyth, he shall 
vse Vnguentum Album. And where as any 
accidence chaunce, as dolour and payne, he 
shall occupye Vnguentum Dialtheum. But 
I shall not nede to make any longer processe of 
medicinall instrumentes, when as I haue as 
I suppose abundantlye shewed in my Antidotarye 
not onely all the principall intentions curatiue 
required in Chirurgirye: but also haue 
set oute medicinall instrumentes both symple 
and compounde, required in thys arte: as also 
their compositions vse and vertues. Their are 
also set oute proper medicynes, dicated and 
apted to the seuerall partes of mans bodye as 
heade, breast, stomacke, longes, lyuer, splene, 
hydnes, bladder, and suche lyke, as is proued of 
Galen in hys worke intituled Secundu~ locos 
Althoughe manye be of contrarye opinion. 
And amonge the reste I wyll showe you a notable 
historye, I thynke to manye knowen, as 
well Phisitians and Chirurgians, as other 
worshipfull and honest. It fortuned that in 
London .1562. that there was a fraye made, and 
the one was thurste throughe the breast vnder 
the pappe, and out vnder the lefte shoulder 
blade so that of force the longes were persed 
[^f.13r^] 
through. There ware diuers Phisicions called 
vnto the woundyd pacient, and they all affirmed 
constantly death to folowe. I also beinge 
called vnto the same pacient, did also affirme 
that death woulde folowe, excepte he receyued 
a certain potion of whiche I had experience 
in the like case in the warres, in England, 
France, Scotland, and other places: and he 
in dede receyued it, and so the longes ware preserued 
from putrifaction and the congelyd blod 
was expellyd oute, the wounde clensyd, and finally 
bythe arte of Chirurgirie he was restored 
to his perfecte helth. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] That man do I right well 
know, his name is Henry Smith a water man, 
he was hurte at quene hiue, and he is yet liuyng 
and in good helth. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Well then, let vs speake of 
metallyne instrumentes. of whiche some of 
them are generall: so called, for that thy do generally 
serue in all woundes, and vlcers: and 
there are particuler instrumentes, seruynge to 
seuerall vses or partes of the bodye. Yet haue 
I hard that diuers affirme howe that in woundes 
generallye there nedyth no other instrumentes 
then an incision knife, to dilate and inlarge 
the wounde. and so wyth the fingers to 
take out the thynges fixid, whether it be pellyt, 
splente, arrowe head, or what els so euer it be: 
[^f.13v^] 
but the errouors of theis are so grose as requireth 
no aunswere, seinge that throughe suche 
kindes of incisions, it happeneth the greate 
vaynes, and arteries to be cut, and so greate 
flux of blode to folowe, (beside the doulour, and 
payne which foloweth and many tymes losse, 
and mutilation of the membre) as is in no case 
tollorable. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Truth it is, but touchynge 
general instrumentes, those which are in most 
vse and ought to be had in redynes of the Chirurgian 
are theis: incision sheares, an incision 
knyfe, a flewme, a lance, whose pictures you 
maye here set oute, and all this serue to cut and 
enlarge a wounde: a cauterizin Iron to cauterize 
with, and stangh fluxe of blode: a payre 
of pincers or nippers, to take of plastres, splegeants 
and thinges fixid in the wounde, a probe 
to serche the wounde with. a crockyd hoke: a 
nedle and a quill to solue and stiche with. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] And what be the instrumentes 
whiche are called proper? 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Proper instrumentes are 
theis whose figures also folowe. as a trappan, 
seruynge to the heade whan as the scul or cranium 
is fracturyd, speculum oris, and speculum 
matricis, also gosiipium, seruyng for luxations 
and fractured bones. a siryngie masculine 
[^f.14r^] 
and also femyne setons for the necke, aleuatorie 
and longe neeles of woode. to drawe through 
the wounde. also gosebilles, crowesbilles, 
& diuers other described & set out of Albucalis, 
Celsus, Tagaltius, and others. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Theis instrumentes be of 
meruaylous vse, and wyth out whiche the Chirurgian 
can nether perfectlye, nether wythout 
greate greife and peril do that is required. and 
amonge the rest in my iudgement the trappen 
is most necessarie, and of an excellent inuention 
in hurtes of the heade. For with out it 
wher cranium is fractured, brosyd, or els anye 
of the inwarde panicles depressed, you shall 
litle preuayle. I my selfe haue vsid it wyth 
great profit diuers tymes, and especiallye ons 
in Cambridge sheire, which I woulde declare 
vnto you, but that I shoulde be somwhat tedious. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Nothynge lesse, but rather 
pleasant. for by vtterynge of thynges done, 
great profit may insewe, and we haue decreed 
to spende this daye in the talke of Chirurgirye 
wherfore we desire you declare that historie and 
we wyll geue diligent care. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Right gladlye. Anno .1559. 
a seruant of one maister Wrothes, ridynge to 
the feildes and ledynge a yonge horse in a halter 
[^f.14v^] 
tyed fast abought the arme of the seruant: the 
horse beynge wylde, and not broken, starkinge 
asyde vnhorsed thy man, and drewe hym by the 
arme a bought a great feilde so long, that what 
wyth strikynge, what wyth drawynge, halyng 
and pullynge, being weried he stode still, vntyll 
company came and losed the halter, and toke 
vp the man half deade, and conuayed hym vnto 
his maisters house. Chirurgians ware sent 
for, who fyndynge. the seruant spechlesse, and 
wyth out remembraunce of any on whome he 
sawe: they not perceyuynge the cause hereof 
them selues, nether yet could be showed of the 
pacient the place affected, departed and left hym 
as vncurable. Maister Wrothe sent for me, 
and I seinge hym spechlesse, and without remembraunce, 
coniectured the hinder parte of 
the heade to be hurte, and smittyn of the horse, 
which I was more certayne of, whan felynge 
that parte I founde it softe. Wherefore I takynge 
of the heer, dyd make firste incision and 
after that set a trappan on his heade, and bored 
Cranium through, and toke oute the peace of 
bone, which done: ther yssued out muche blod, 
blacke in colour, and drawynge to putrifaction 
out of the contused and broken vaynes. the 
nexte daye folowynge, the seruant spaeke and 
came agayne to his perfecte remembraunce, 
and I vsyng thynges in this cure as arte required, 
[^f.15r^] 
God restored the man in my handes to his 
perfecte helth. I coulde also showe you other examples 
wher the like chaunses haue happened, 
and the Chirurgians eyther not knowynge, or 
wilfullye neglectynge this profitable instrument, 
haue brought the pacients to there laste 
ende. so happened it to a seruaunt of maister 
Pagetes in fylpotte lane .1538. ond diuers 
other, whome for breuitie I do let passe. 
 
[}Io. Yates.}] This was a worthy cure, 
and this is a noble instrument, but the Chirurgians 
whiche neglecte thuse of this or the like 
instrumentes, are of the opinion of that the rude 
Emperike Smith was, who in a folishe boke of 
him published, did inuay against Chirurgians 
whiche trapened the heade in any griefe of the 
same, and semeth to him selfe as it ware an 
other Thessalus to ouer throughe the famous 
authers, and Inuentours of this instrument. 
whan (in the iudgement of the lerned) he was 
no more to them comparable, then the light of 
a sparke of fire, is equall to the mooste radiant 
and shyning beames of beautifull Phœbus. 
 
[}Io. Feilde.}] This nowe spoken of instrumentes 
(whiche a Chirurgian muste haue in 
redines) shall suffice. nowe let vs showe the 
methode and way howe the person being fitte 
to be admitted to Chirurgirye, maye lerne the 
arte, lesse that confusedlye he lerne that firste, 
[^f.15v^] 
whiche sholde be last, and so set the carte before 
the horse, to his no smal hyndraunce. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] And for this ther is to be folowed 
and obserued two preceptes: firste, that 
we procede from thynges comon, vnto those 
whiche are particuler, or from thynges vniuersall, 
vnto more perticuler. as first to knowe 
an infla~mation, then howe many kyndes of infla~mations 
there are. the seconde precepte is, 
that we begynne at thynges knowen and so 
procede vnto those whyche are lesse knowen, 
as firste in the curation of woundes, we muste 
begynne wyth a simple wounde: whiche done, 
we shal procede to the curation of compounde 
woundes. so in lyke maner in vlcers, firste to 
knowe and cure a simple vlcer, and then to take 
in hande compounde vlcers, begynnyng wyth 
those that are lesse compound, and haue smalest 
accidents: and so to procede vnto those that are 
more co~pound, & haue most & greatest accidents 
ioyned wyth them. the like is also to be obserued 
in other arts, & scie~ties, as in iudgyng of colors, 
first to know whight & blacke, then other colors 
which are not so manifest according as they com 
& spring of y=e= mixture of theis .ii. now knowynge 
& considering theis two preceptes, it is necessary 
for the right vse of his instruments medicinall, & 
metalline: to co~sider two thinges, that is to say, 
thinges called accordinge to natur and thynges 
against nature. 
 
[}Io. Yates.}] I pray you 
[^f.16r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.19.^] 
what are those which are called accordynge to 
nature? & how many be they in nombre? 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Guido numbreth those 
thinges whiche are called accordynge to nature 
to be .vj. that is to say, helth, the cause of helthe, 
theffect of helth, strength, custome, & co~plexion. 
and helth is defined to be an effecte according to 
nature, apte to performe the actio~s of the same. 
 
[}Io. Yates.}] And what doe this .vj. thynges 
accordynge to nature, teache and showe me? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Because the Chirurgian is natures 
freinde, & minister: theis showe you that 
you must conserue & kepe them by ther like, & 
also to expel ther contraries, which wold distroy 
and ouerthrowe them. 
 
[}Io. Yates.}] And wherof do theis .vj. thinges 
spring, & by what thynges shall I conserue the~? 
for although you say vnto me, y=t= they are conserued 
& kept by ther like, yet is it not sufficient to 
my vnderstandinge, except you two showe me 
what they are. 
 
[}Io. Feilde.}] I wyll tell 
you, theis .vj. thinges which are secundum naturam, 
spring of,vij. natural thinges entring the 
co~position of mans body. that is to say .iiii. Elements, 
fire ayer, water, yearth. co~plexions, as 
hote, colde, moyste, & drie. iiij.humors, blod, coller, 
fleume & mela~cholie, me~bres of ma~s body. vertues, 
animal, vital, & natural, with ther operatio~s, 
& spirits. of theis .7. natural springeth helth 
& y=e= other rehersed which are accordi~g to nature 
[^f.16v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.19.^] 
The conseruation of helth dothe consist in the 
right vse of .vj. thynges named in latin res non 
naturales. lyke as in the abuse of them, the decay 
of helth and bredynge of sycknes and infirmities 
foloweth. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] It is right so, and theis sixe 
are called, ayer: meate and drynke: motion and 
quiet; slepe and wachynge: repletion and inaninition: 
and the perturbations or affections of 
the mynde. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] I trust I am sufficientlye 
taught how to vse my instrumentes accordyng 
to the indication taken of the thinges which are 
accordynge to nature: nowe I pray you let me 
vnderstande what those thynges are whiche are 
againste nature, howe manye they are in numbre, 
and what indication is to be taken of them: 
for the further vse of my instrumentes. 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] Those whiche are agaynste 
nature, are so called: because they are contrary 
to the same, and doe further destroy and ouercome 
nature, and are vtter enemyes to helth, 
and theis are .iij. in nombre: sycknes, the cause 
of skynes, and the accident. the cause of sycknes, 
is that effect contrarye to nature, whyche 
goeth before the sycknes, and prouoketh the 
same, and ther are accoumpted of Galen, and 
the Grecians whome I folowe) two causes of 
[^f.17r^] 
sycknes. the one beinge outwarde, called procatarctike, 
or cause primatiue: the other is with 
in vs, and is named the cause antecedent, or 
precedent, or cause interne. sicknes also is defyned 
of Galen to be an affecte againste nature: 
of whyche the action of nature is firste hurte, 
& vitiated. and the same Galen doth also make 
iij. kindes of sicknes generallye, accordynge to 
the partes of mans bodye in whyche they are. 
as in the similer partes, sycknes is called intemperature, 
whiche is eyther hotte, colde, moyst, 
or drye: or els hotte and moyst, hotte and drye: 
cold and moyst: cold and drye: and yf it be in the 
instrumental partes, the sycknes is namyd, yll 
constitution or conformation: but yf sycknes 
happen bothe to similer and instrumentall 
partes, then it hath to name, solution or diuision 
of co~tinuitie. Also the accident is one effect 
against nature in lyke sorte as the cause of sicknes 
and sycknes it selfe is: but it differet from 
them in this, that like as the cause goethe before 
sycknes and prouoketh it: so doth the accident 
folowe sycknes, lyke as the shadowe doth 
the man. nowe this worde accident, is taken 
generally, of whiche we wyll nothyng speake, 
and it is vnderstande more straytlye, or properlye, 
so is accidente three wayes diuided. for 
eyther the action is hurte and quite abolished, 
as blyndelnes in the eye: or els diminished, as 
[^f.17v^] 
dimnisse of syght, or els the action is corrupted 
as the syght depraued, and for the indication 
whiche is taken of theis three thynges 
agaynste nature: note theis twoo greate, (and 
of all men alowed) conclusions. Contraria 
sunt contrariorum remedia. also, similia conseruantur 
similibus. lyke as thynges whyche 
are accordynge to nature, are conserued and 
kepte by ther lyke: so also thynges contarye, are 
remedies for ther contraryes. and therfore theis 
iij. thynges agaynste nature, showeth you that 
they are to be expelled and put away by there 
contraryes. as for example, solution of continuitye 
beinge sycknes bothe of similer and instrumentall 
partes showeth that he muste be 
put awaye by his contrarye, that is vnition and 
Ioyninge agayne, also heat is put awaye by 
couldnes: couldnes by heate: drynes by moystnes, 
and moystnes by drines: and soin like sorte 
in other sycknesses the indication is taken of 
the contrarietie. doe you nowe vnderstand this? 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Right well, so that nowe 
I doe perceyue that the right vse of my instrumentes 
medicinall, and metallyne, is takyng 
of thynges accordynge to nature, whyche 
showeth the conseruation by lyke and agreable 
medicynes: and of thynges agaynste nature, 
whyche teacheth me to applye thynges contrary 
[^f.18r^] 
wher by I may take awaye all that which 
is againste nature. but yf you wilbe so good as 
to set oute (though it be in breafe wordes compendiouslye) 
those thynges agaynste nature, 
whyche falleth vnder the handes of the Chirurgian, 
as you haue made playne to me those 
thynges whyche are accordynge to nature: I 
shoulde thynke my selfe so muche bounde, as 
hardly I shalbe able to reco~pence. for althoughe 
I knowe that thynges contrary to nature, are 
to be remoued by there contraryes, yet if I 
haue not the exacte knowledge what those 
thinges are, I shall very hardly be able to aplie 
and vse there contraries. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] It is suerlye so, for howe 
muche wyde you are in knowledge of the sycknes: 
so farre wyde shall you also be in fyndyng 
our apte and conuenient remedies, and those 
perticuler grefes, or affectes againste nature 
whyche are subiecte to Chirurgirie (as Galen 
witnesseth in the .14. booke 13. chapter of his therapeutike 
methode) are for the mooste part reduced 
to .v. Titles or chapters. that is to wete 
tumours againste nature, woundes, vlcers, 
fractures, and luxations, there be other thinges 
besides theis which require the vse of the hand: 
but theis rehearsyd perfectly knowen, thother 
wilbe easye to attayne vnto. 
 
[^f.18v^] 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then I praye you begynne 
fyrst wyth tumours, and those beyng fynished 
procede to the rest. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Fyrst it behoueth you to know 
that thys woorde tumour (called in Greeke 
onchos) is not that whych Auicenne, and the 
Arrabians name Apostema, and the Latinistes 
call Abscessus. For tumour is a generall name 
to all apostems, and tumours, where as thys 
worde aposteme strecheth no further but onely 
where as phlegmone is torned into matter, & 
three other tumours called Atheroma, steatoma, 
& meliceris. so that this word aposteme, is 
not so large and generall a name, as tumour is: 
and therfore abused of Guido, and other, where 
they call all tumours agaynste nature, by the 
name of apostemes. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Why fyr, be not all tumours 
agaynst nature? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] No for sothe, for then it had 
bene for hym superfluous to haue added these 
wordes, against nature. And Galen in his boke 
De tumoribus præter naturam, maketh three 
kyndes of tumoures. One that is secundum 
naturam, accordyng to nature: as the branes, 
muscules, and other emynencies of mans bodye. 
The seconde is called aboue nature: when 
[^f.19r^] 
as these forenamed partes are increased more 
then their naturall forme, and fygure: but yet 
in suche sorte that the partes can doe theyr officies. 
The laste kynde of tumour is called tumour 
agaynst nature. Because thy hurte the 
action of the parte where it infesteth. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] I doe nowe cal to rememberance 
Master doctour Cunyngham who made 
also the same diuision of tumours .1563. when 
he red the booke of Galen of tumours agaynst 
ture to the Chirurgians of London in the hall, 
but I pray you let me learne what a tumour against 
nature is? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Out of the same booke of Galen, 
you may gather thys defynition. A tumour 
agaynst nature, is an augmentation, or swellynge, 
excedyng the natural fygure of the same 
and hurteth the action of the same. But 
Auicenne saith that an aposteme (for so calleth 
he a tumor) is a sicknes co~pound of thre kind of 
infirmities, that is to say of intemperatures, of 
yl co~stitutio~, & solutio~s of co~tinuity: these words 
you shall finde in the first booke of his Canon. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] How many kind of tumours 
are there. 
 
[}Io. Feild.}] Guido & other writers of his time 
make .iii. kindes of tumors: Apostema, Pustula, 
& Exitura. Apostema he calleth a great tumor 
[^f.19v^] 
in whych the matter (whereof it springeth) doth 
offende rather in quantitie, then qualitie. pustula 
he doth make a lesser tumour, in whych the 
matter dothe hurte by qualitye, rather then 
quantitie. And thys tumour tharabians call 
Bothor. the threid, whiche Guido nameth 
Exitura: is that whiche the Grecians doe properly 
cal Apostema, & the latinistes: Abscessus. 
 
[}Thomas Gale.}] But the Grecians doe 
make differences of tumors, accordynge to the 
substaunce wherof they doe spryng. so shal ther 
be but two kyndes of tumors generally. that is 
to say. humoralis, spryagyng of humors, and 
flatuosus commynge of wyndye spirites: this 
Guido termeth Apostema ventosum. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] And howe many differences 
is ther of tumors whych do spryng of humors? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Twoo, simple, and compounde. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Howe many simple be ther? 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] There be also .ij. hote & colde 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Why are theis tumours 
called simple and compounde? 
 
[}Thomas Gale.}] They are called simple, 
whan as they sprynge of one sincere humour, 
with out the mixture of other. and they are called 
compounde, whan the tumor cometh of two 
[^f.20r^] 
or more humors. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Wherfore are the tumors 
called hotte, or colde? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] They are called hotte, because 
they sprynge of hoote humours: and named 
coulde by the lyke reason, because thy are 
ingendryd of could humours. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] How many hotte tumours 
be ther, and how many colde? 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] Diuers, and sondrye, as you 
shall perceyue by the processe of our talke. but 
the most famous are foure: spryngynge of the 
iiij. humours simplye, wyth out the myxture of 
other of theis two &c. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Whiche be thay. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] One comyth of blode, and is 
called Phlegmone, in Englishe, inflamation: 
an other springeth of coller, and is called Erysipelas, 
or .S. Anthonies fyer: and theis be hoote 
tumours. an other cometh of fleume, and is named 
Oedema: the forth is ingendred of melancholie, 
and hath to name Scirrhus. This two tumours, 
are colde, all other simple tumours are 
aptly reduced to theis .iiii. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] And what be the compound 
tumours? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] They be diuers and varieth 
ther names accordynge to the mixture of humors. 
[^f.20v^] 
and the humor are mixyd, equally, or inequally, 
if they be myxed equally: then the tumour 
is called Phlegmone and Eryspelas. but 
yf they be inequallye mixyd, then the tumor, 
taketh name of the humor whiche surmounteth, 
as blod surmounting choller, in a tumor: 
it is called Phlegmon Erisipelatodes, if fleume 
be myxed with blode in stede of coller in forme 
as is aforesayd: then the tumor is named phlegmone 
Oedomatodes, and if blode myxyd with 
melancholy surmounte it is called Phlegmone 
scirrhodes. so in lyke case there are .iij. tumors 
whiche take names of the humors myxyd with 
collor, coller hauynge the dominion as whan 
blod is wyth collor they call the tumor Eryspelas 
Phlegmonosum. If fleume, Eryspelas Oedematosum, 
and if melancholike then the tumor 
hath to name Eryspelas scirrhosim in lyke 
maner, fleme hauing dominion in the moisture 
wyth any of the other three humors, the tumor 
is firste called Oedema, and then yf coller be 
mixyyd wyth it they adde this worde Erysipelatosum. 
If blode the tumor is called Oedema 
Phlegmonosum, and yf melancholie, then is it 
namyd Oedema scirrhosum. and to conclude, 
the lyke is to be sayde of melancholie whan as 
any of the other .iij. are mixed wyth as scirrhus 
[^f.21r^] 
Phlegmonosus, scirrhus Erysipelatosus, and 
Scirrhus Oedematosus: blod, coller or fleume 
beinge vnequallye mixyd wyth melancholye. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] What profit insueth to the 
Chirurgian by knowynge the mixtur of theis 
humors, in tumors against nature? 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Greate profite, for by 
knowyng the true mixture, he is taught therafter 
accordingly to vary his medicines. for like as 
a simple tumour hath a simple cure & is curyd 
by his contrarie: so a compounde tumor hath a 
compounde cure & is curyd by his contrarie. as 
for the more plainer vnderstandyng, if y=e= tumor 
be mixyd of fleume and melancholie equallye: 
then shal you equally mixe suche medicynes together, 
as are conuenientlye vsed in Oedema 
and Scirrhus, But if fleume, and melancholie 
be inequally mixyd: and the greater portion is 
fleume, then in the composition you must in 
lyke maner put the greater portion of suche medicynes 
as you vse in Oedema, and the lesser of 
suche as are applyed in Scirrhus. and this rule, 
and precepte is to be diligently obserued in all 
compounde sycknes. and for because the mixture 
of theis tumors, is so necessarie for a Chirurgian, 
as you maye righte well perceyue by 
that whiche is nowe spoken: beholde this table 
which showeth you all the mixture and names 
[^f.21v^] 
of tumors against nature. Whych for the great 
profit wolde be commytted to Memorye, of hym 
that wil haue the Methode of curyng co~pounde 
tumors against nature. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] You promysed to showe the 
tumors which are refered to the .iiij. principall 
simple tumors, Phlegmone Erisipelas, oedema: 
and scirrhus. 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] And that we promised, we will 
performe, first vttering ther names: & that being 
done, we wil show you ther definitions. And we 
wil begin w=t= sanguine tumors, which are referred 
to Phlegmone: & then procede to the reste. 
There are referred to phlegmone: Phygethlon, 
Bubo, Phyma, Dothienes, Anthrax, gargareon, 
Paristhmia, ancurisma, Gangrena, & 
Sphacelus. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] What is Phlegmone? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Galen affirmith phlegmone (or 
as we cal it in English, an infla~mation) to come 
of the flux of blode by the greater vaines, & arteries, 
vnto those whiche are lesser: & fro~ them vnto 
those vaines which are lest of all (which because 
they are no greater then heres, are) called capillares. 
These vaines beinge fylled w=t= this contynual 
flux of blod, part yssuith out be y=e= mouthes 
of the vaines: & part by y=e= cotes of y=e= same, wherby 
the voide spaces are filled, inflamed, distended 
[^f.22r^] 
& streched out. And this tumor galen calleth 
the inequall intemperature of the muscle. And 
note, that there are two kindes of inflammations. 
One which is called vera inflammatio, & 
this springeth of good and naturall blode. The 
other is named Non vera, coming of yll and vnnaturall 
bloode, and this is common to all inflammations. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] What cal you Phygethlon? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] That which Celsus nameth Panus 
and this tumour is an inflammation of the 
glandilous partes in the neecke armpites and 
grine, which yf they be indurated after this inflamation, 
ther cometh tumors which is named 
Chœrades in latine strumas and Guido nameth 
then scrofulas and then this tumor is numbred 
amonge flegmatike tumours. And is wyth vs 
vsually called the kings euyll: because the kings 
and Queenes of England (by a diuyne and peculer 
gyfte of God) doe cure suche as are molested 
wyth this infirmitie, whan as no arte 
of Chirurgerye can take place. And thys differeth 
muche from that syckenes whyche the Latynestes 
name Regium morbum. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Wherefore is it called in 
Greeke Chœras? 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Eyther of stones apearing 
[^f.22v^] 
by the Seas, or els of swyne whiche are often 
vered wyth this tumor. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] As touchyng Bubo, Guido 
calleth it a flegmaticke aposteme, wherfore I 
wyll let that passe vntyll we come to the reasonynge 
of the same. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] You seame to accuse vs of 
errour, or ignoraunce whan as we shoulde 
numbre flegmatike apostemes as you cal them 
amonges sanguine tumours. But I wyll this 
affirme boldye that Guido eyther meaneth 
some other tumor whiche he so calleth: or els he 
repugneth manifestly wyth Galens authoritie. 
for Galen maketh Bubo a simple inflammation 
of the glandelous partes in that flankes. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] I doe not accuse you but rather 
showe you Guido his mynde: which seing 
that it doth not agree wyth Galenes I muste 
gyue place and alwaye preferre Galen before 
Guido. Wherfore I pray you procede with the 
other inflammations and showe me what the 
tumor is whiche the Grekes call Phyma. 
 
[}Io. Feilde.}] This tumor is a pushe which 
wyll presently as yt ware come to suppuration, 
and it is called Phyma by similitude it hath 
with puffes or mushrumes spryngyng oute of 
the yearth. and ther be two kyndes of theis tumors, 
one comynge of heate, an other of coulde 
[^f.23r^] 
but we in this place do nombre onely the hoote 
tumor amonge inflammotions. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Dothienes foloweth nexte 
in order. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Dothienes in Greke, is called 
of Auicenne, Aldemurenul, of Celsus surunculus, 
with vs a felone or cattes heare, & is a 
sharpe swyllynge wyth inflammation chancing 
in the fingers with dolour & torneth to matter 
spedelye, and theis often haue a feuer ioyned 
with them. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] What is Anthrax? 
 
[}Io. Feild.}] That same which we cal Carbunculus. 
and is an vlcerous tumor springyng 
of grosse melancholycke bloude putrifyed. 
This tumor foloweth greate inflammations, 
and ther are two kindes of carbuncles. the one 
more Ientle and benigne: the other pestilential, 
and mortall, and the carbuncle is both wyth 
pustles and also without. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Guido maketh difference 
betwixte anthrax and carbunculus. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Ther is no difference at all, 
but that anthrax is a greke worde & Carbunculus 
a Latyne. For Guidoes difference wher he 
maketh anthrax a malignant tumor, is no other 
thing then the pestilential carbuncle. but his diriuation 
of the name is more ridiculous where 
[^f.23v^] 
he saith that Anthrax is said of Antra, whyche 
he saith signifieth the harte, but in what tungne 
Antra is vsed for the hart that he left vnwritte~. 
sure I am, that it is neyther latyne, Greke, nor 
arabicke worde. 
 
[}Io. Yates.}] Wel then I am herein satisfied 
touchynge the Carbuncle, what defyne you 
Gargareon to be? 
 
[}Iohn Feild.}] Gargareon called in latyne 
Columella is an inflammation of vuvla, like as 
Paristhmia or tonsille are inflamations of the 
kernelles situated in the beginning of y=e= iawes. 
Guido & other of his sect call them Amygdalas. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Anecurisma is nexte. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] This tumoure is no other 
thynge, then a dilatation or rather relaxation 
in the arteries, whereby the bloode and spirites 
are dispersed makyng a softe tumour whyche beinge 
pressed, with the fyngers semeth to vanish 
awaye: but the fyngers taken agayne away, 
the tumour cometh to his wonted bygnes 
againe. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] If you doe in like sort set out 
what Gangrena & sphacelus are then you haue 
finished all suche tumoures as are referred to 
flegmone. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Galen in hys second booke 
whych he wrotte to his frende Glauco defyneth 
[^f.24r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.61.^] 
gangrenam to be a mortifycation of the member 
vnconfyrmed, sprynging of greate inflammations. 
And Sphacelus called of diuers wryters 
Aschachilos. and of the latinestes syderatio 
is the exacte and confyrmed mortification of the 
member. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then by your wordes I gather 
that bothe Gangrena and Sphacelus folowe 
after greate inflammations: and that they 
two differ in this, that Gangrena is as it were 
in growing and increasing euer more and more 
towarde mortification of the member: and sphacelus 
is whan as Gangrena ceasith to corrupte 
further the member, and that is nowe perfectlye 
mortifyed and deade voyde of all naturall 
heate, blode, spirites, and feeling. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] You haue rightly sayde. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Then seyng we haue thus 
ended such sanguyne tumoures as are referred 
to Phlegmone, I praye you in lyke maner 
procede in the coloricke tumours whyche are of 
like affinite with Erysipelas? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Wee wyll so doe. Unto 
Erysipelas are referryd Herpes, Phlyctene, Epinyctides 
and Hydroa. But fyrste wee 
wyl define what Erysipelas is, and then procede 
to the reste. 
 
[^f.24v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.61.^] 
[}Iohn Yates.}] I thanke you that you will 
accomplishe my request and desire. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Erysipelas beynge of much 
affinitie with Phlegmone, called also of the 
Latinestes ignis sacer, of vs wylde fyre or 
Saincte Anthonies fyre, is a fluxe of coller 
staying aboute the skynne nothyng molesting 
the fleshe. And it differeth from Phlegmone 
fyrste that there is no pulsatiue dolour in it, 
then that in the inflammation of bloode the 
colour is alwaye redde: in Erysipelas the colour 
is yelowyshe pale: laste that Phlegmone 
ys an affecte of the muscules: and Erysipelas 
is onely of the skynne and thys is to be vnderstande 
of Verum Erysipelas. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Is there any more then one 
kynde of Erysipelas? 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] Haue you forgotte~ that which 
was before rehearsed of compounde tumours? 
And that there was Erysipelas Phlegmonosum, 
Oedematosum, and scirrhosum? These be 
comprehended in dede vnder the name of compounde 
colloricke tumours or Erysipelas illegittimum. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] So then you make two kinds 
of Erysipelas verum: and also illegittimum. 
 
[}Iohn Feiid.}] It is ryghte so. And that 
[^f.25r^] 
whyche is illegittimat or not ryghte Erysipela 
is also diuided into two kyndes. The one commyng 
of the groser and thicker sencere coller 
and is named Erysipelas wyth vlceration and 
the other is coller hauynge other humoures 
mixed with it as I saide before. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Seynge then that I vnderstande 
what Erysipelas is, and howe manye 
kyndes also there are of them: I praye you let 
me vnderstand what herpes, is for that foloweth 
nexte in order. 
 
[}Iohn Feilde.}] Herpes is that tumour and 
affection of the skynne whyche Hippocrates so 
dothe name of corrodyng and deuourynge the 
skynne: for herpo is that whiche is called in latyne 
Serpo whereof commeth herpys quasi serpens. 
And there is two kyndes of herpes, one 
called herpes Estiomenos, so called because it 
eateth and deuoureth: the other is named Cenchros 
in latyne miliaris for that the tumour is 
like Millit seade. 
 
[}Iohn Yates.}] Guido 
dothe speake of Estiomenus in this wyse. Estiomenus 
est mors et dissipatio membri: et propter 
hoc dicitur Estiomenus, quasi hominis hostis, 
cum putrifactione & mollificatione membri. 
 
[}Tho. Gale.}] where Guido sayth that Estiomenus 
[^f.25v^] 
is the death and dissipation of the 
membred and for that is called Estiomenus as 
who shoulde saye the enemye of man, comynge 
with putrefaction and mollification: I do litle 
in my Iudgement alowe hym, first that he leaueth 
the princes of Phisicke Hippocrates Galene 
and Paulus, and foloweth those of smale 
lernynge and authoritie: and then that he will 
seame to interprete that tungue in whiche he 
had small knowledge. for wher ded he euer red 
amonge the Grecians that the tumour Estiomenus 
was confoundyd with Sphacelus, which 
in dede is the mortification of the membre. and 
agayn wher lerned he the deriuatio~ of Estiomenus 
to be hominis hostis. But this maye yet 
seame tolorable in Guido, whan that Auicenne 
gyuynge occasion of errour to other, comprehendynge 
both kyndes of herpes, vnder the 
name of formica, doeth also mooste absurdlye 
comprehende myrmecias (that is to saye formicas 
and is a kynde of wartes) vnder the 
name of herpes and so confoundeth bothe 
to gether. but this shall suffice touchynge 
herpes.
