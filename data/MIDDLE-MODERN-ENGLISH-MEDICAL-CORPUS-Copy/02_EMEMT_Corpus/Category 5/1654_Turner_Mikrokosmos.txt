A Description of the little world.}] 
 
[}CHAP. I.}] 
 
[}Shewing the Definition of Chyrurgery, the qualifications 
of a Chyrurgion, and Anatomy 
of the simple Members.}] 
 
CHyrurgery is derived, [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], which is as 
much as to say a hand working: 
so that Chyrurgery is a working 
of the hand in the body of 
man, in cutting or opening 
those parts that be whole, in 
healing those parts that be broken or cut, and in 
taking away that which is superfluous, as Warts, 
Wens, Scurfula's, and the like: To the cure of every 
disease belongeth four things; the first and 
principall is God, the second the Chyrurgion, the 
third the Medicine and fourth the Patient: Therefore 
the Chyrurgion ought to be Religious, Ingenious, 
[^p.2^] 
Learned, and Expert, both in Theorick and 
in Practick; he must be skilfull in the Anatomy, 
else he will be like a blind man to carve an Image; 
he must be secret and private; as a Confessour to 
his Patient, not discouraging any, nor setting a 
certain day of his recovery, as Mountebanks doe, 
for that is not in their power, oportet se ipsum non 
solum, neither let them backbite others nor vaunt 
and praise themselves, that will redound more to 
their shame then credit, for their own workes will 
get credit enough. 
 
Of the simple members there be 11. and 2. superfluities, 
viz. Bones, Cartilages, Nerves, Pannicles, 
Ligaments, Cords, Arteries, Veynes, fatnesse, 
flesh, and skin; the superfluities be haires and 
nailes; the bones be the foundation and hardest 
member of the body; it is a consimile member, 
simple and spermatick, cold and dry of complexion, 
insensible and inflexible, and hath divers 
formes in mans body, for the severall operations 
thereof, and diversity of helpings; the gristle is a 
member simple and spermatick, next in hardnesse 
to the bone, and is of complexion cold and dry, and 
insensible. 
 
The Ligament is a member consimple, simple, 
and spermatick, next in hardnesse to the gristle, and 
of complexion cold and dry, flexible and sensible, 
and binds the bones together. 
 
The sinew is a consimile member, simple and 
[^p.3^] 
spermatick, mean between hard and soft, strong 
and tough, having his beginning from the braine, 
or from minuca, which is the marrow of the back, 
and from the braine cometh seven paire of Nerves 
sentative, and from minuca cometh seven pair of 
Nerves motive, and one that is by himselfe that 
springeth from the last spondell. 
 
A Cord or Tendon is an officiall member compounds 
and spermatick, sinowy, strong, and tough, 
meanly between hardnesse and softnesse, and sensible 
and flexible, cold and dry. 
 
An Arterie is a member simple and spermatick, 
hollow and sinowy, having his beginning from 
the heart, and bringeth from the heart to every 
member, spirit, and life, it is of complexion cold 
and dry; and all these Arteries have two coates, 
except one that goeth to the lungs, and he hath 
but one coat, that spreadeth abroad in the lungs, 
and bringeth to the lungs bloud and spirit of life, 
and sendeth from thence ayre to temper the famous 
heat that is in the heart: A veyne is a simple 
member, in complexion cold and dry, and 
spermatick like to the Arterie, having his beginning 
from the liver, nutritive bloud to nourish every 
member of the body with; and the Arterie is a 
vessell of bloud spirituall or vitall, and a veyne a 
vessell of bloud nutrimentall; the flesh is a simple 
member not spermatick, ingendred of bloud, in 
complexion hot and moist: There is three kindes 
[^p.4^] 
of flesh, the one soft and pure, the second musculus, 
hard or brawny, the third is grandulus, knotty 
or kurnelly: Next is fatnesse, whereof likewise 
is three kindes, pinguedo, which is made of a subtill 
portion of bloud, congealed by cold; it is cold 
and moist, insensible and intermedled amongst the 
parts of the flesh; the second is adeppes, of the 
same kind as the other, but is parted from the flesh 
besides the skin, and is as an oyle healing the skin, 
and moistning it; the third is auxingia, parted 
from the flesh about the kidneys and entrails. 
 
The skin is a member officiall, partly spermatick, 
strong and tough, flexible and sensible, thin 
and temperate, one covereth the outward members, 
and the other the inward, which is called a 
pannicle. 
 
The haires are superfluities made of the grosse 
fume or smoake passing out of the viscous matter, 
and thickned to the form of hair. 
 
The nailes likewise are superfluous humours, 
engendred of earthly fume, waxing through the 
naturall heat of humours to the extremity of the 
fingers and toes, in complexion cold and dry, and 
is softer then the bone and harder then the flesh, 
&c. 
 
[^p.5^] 
[}CHAP. II.}] 
 
[}Of the compound members: 1. Of the head.}] 
 
THe head is the habitation or dwelling place 
of the reasonable soule of man, as, homini 
sublime dedit; it is raised up by God as a watch 
tower over all the body; it is composed of hair, 
skin, flesh, veines, Pannicles, and bones; the hair 
defendeth the braine from too much heat, and too 
much cold, it beautifieth and adorneth the head 
and face, and by it the fumosity of the braine are 
purged; the skin of the head is more lazartus 
and thicker then any other of the body, defendeth 
the braine, and keepeth it warme, and bindeth and 
keepeth the bones of the head fast together; the 
flesh is musculus or lazartus lying upon pericranium 
without means. 
 
Next followeth pericranium, or the covering of 
the bones of the head, between the flesh, and 
which passeth a veine and an arteir, that nourisheth 
the utter part of the head, passeth through the skul 
and nourisheth the pannicles of the braine, and 
hereof is made dura mater, which is nearer the 
braine then pericranium, and under the skull. 
 
Next is the bone or pot of the head, whereof 
there be seven in number in the pan or skull; the 
first is the Coronall Bone, in which is the holes of 
[^p.6^] 
the eyes, and reacheth from the browes to the 
midst of the head, where it meeteth with a second 
bone of the hinder part of the head called the noddell 
of the head, which two bones be divided by 
the comissaries in the midst of the head; the third 
and fourth bones be called Parietales, and they be 
divided by the comissaries from the two former; 
the fifth and sixth be called Petrosa or mendosa, on 
each side of the head one, wherein are the holes of 
the eares; the seventh and last is called Paxillary 
or Bazillary, which bone as a wedge doth fasten 
the rest together. These are the parts of the head 
containing, next followeth the parts contained: 
The first is dura mater, then pia mater, then the 
substance of the brain, vermi formes & rete mirabile; 
the Pannicle dura mater is made of the vein 
& arterie spoken of before, which passeth through 
the seames of the head, which dura mater is seperated 
from the bone of the skull, the better to defend 
the pia mater; the next is the pannicle called 
pia mater, which is tender and soft over the brain, 
and in it are contained a great number of veines 
and arteries, giving unto the brain both spirit and 
life, from the heart and from the liver nutriment; 
this pannicle circumvolveth all the substance, and 
there the spirit is made animall; these pannicles 
be cold and dry, spermatick; next unto this pannicle 
is the brain it selfe, which is divided into 
three ventricles, the formost which is most, the 
[^p.7^] 
middlemost lesse, and the hindmost which is least, 
and from each to other be issues and passages conveying 
spirit of life; and every ventricle is divided 
into two parts: in the formost ventricle God 
hath placed the common senses, in the one part 
thereof is contained the fansie, in the other part the 
imaginative vertue, which receiveth the forme of 
sensible things, representing them to the memory: 
in the middle sell or ventrickle there is placed the 
contemplative or cogitative virtue; and in the 
third or last the virtue memorative, out of whose 
lower parts springeth Mynuca, or marrow of the 
Spondels: Further, from the formost ventrickle 
there springs seven paire of sinewes, produced to 
the eyes, ears, the nose, the tongue, and the stomack, 
and to divers other parts of the body: About 
the middle ventrickle is the place of vermi 
formis, with curnelly flesh that filleth, and rete mirabile, 
that wonderfull net or caule under the pannicles 
of small arteries only comming from the 
heart, and there the spirit of feeling hath his first 
creation, and from thence passeth to other members; 
the brain is a member cold and moist, thin 
and meanly viscous and spermatick, continually 
moving and ruling all other members of the body, 
giving them feeling and moving: And Aristotle 
saith, that it followeth the course of the Moon; 
in the waxing of the Moon it followeth upwards, 
and in the wane of the Moon it discends downwards, 
[^p.8^] 
and is lesse in substance of virtue, and is not 
so obedient to the spirit of feeling, as it appears 
in lunaticks, and such as have the falling sicknesse, 
who are most grieved in the beginning of the new 
Moon, and in the wane of the Moon; therefore if 
the brain be either too dry or too moist, it cannot 
worke its kind, whereby the spirits of life melt 
and resolve away, and then followeth sicknesse 
and feeblenesse of the wits and other members, 
and in the end death, and thus much of the head. 
 
[}CHAP. III.}] 
 
[}Of the face.}] 
 
THe first part of the face is the forehead, which 
containeth skin and musculus flesh, the pannicle 
under it is of pericranium, and the bone Coronall, 
which passeth from one eare to another 
with a musckle, which keepeth up the eye-brows, 
which are called supercilium, and under them is 
the eye-lids, called cilium, which defend the eyes 
f_[^GREEK OMITTED^]om annoyances, and are set and adorned with 
haires, the eares are gristly, the organ or instrument 
of hearing cold and dry, the sinews whereof 
spring from the brain, and through them is received 
the sound, and conveyed to the common 
wits; The eyes be next of nature unto the soule, 
wherein is seen the passions of the soule, as joy, 
gladness, love, wrath &c, They are the instruments 
of sight compounded of seven tunicles or 
[^p.9^] 
roles, and three humours, and these sinewes be 
hollow as a reed, that thereby the visible things 
might passe to the sight; now these sinews go out 
from the substance of the brain, passing through 
pia mater, where he taketh a pannickle, and these 
are called nervi optici, and are joyned in one before 
they come into the eye, that if any disease 
happen in one eye the other should receive the visible 
spirit, and that one sinew might stay and 
help the other: Now the three humours are placed 
in the middle of the eyes, the first is the vitriall 
humour like glasse, liquid and thin, and is innermost 
next to the brain, and he compasseth the 
christalline humour, untill he meeteth the humour 
Albuginus, which is set in the uppermost part of 
the eye, and in the midst of these humours is placed 
the christaline humour, in which is the principall 
sight of the eye; and these humours be involved 
with the pannicles, between every humour a pannicle, 
and thus is the eye made; the next unspoken 
of in order is the nose; from the braine 
cometh two sinews to the holes of the brain pan, 
where doth begin the concavity of the nose, and 
these two be the organs or instruments of smelling, 
they have heads like teats or paps, and receive 
the smelling conveying it to the common senses; 
over these two is colatorium, the nosthrils between 
the eyes, and through them passeth the spirit of 
smelling unto the instrument of smelling, and by 
[^p.10^] 
them the superfluities of the brain are cleansed, and 
from his concavity there passeth two holes down 
into the mouth, whereby ayre passeth too and fro 
into the lungs, and when these are stopped then 
one is sayd to speak in his nose; it is made of skin 
and lazartus flesh, and of two bones standing triangle 
wise, joyned to the coronall bone, and it 
hath two gristles that hold up the nose, and two 
muskles to help the working of his office: The 
cheekes are the sideling parts of the face, and they 
containe in them musculous flesh with veines and 
arteries; about these parts be many muskles, Guido 
saith seven about the cheekes and upper lip, and 
Haly Abbas, that there be twelve that move the 
nether jaw in opening and shutting, that passe under 
the bones of the temples, they are called temporals, 
and they be sensitive, and whose hurt is 
dangerous: Then there be also other muskles for 
to grinde and to chew, and to all these muskles 
cometh nerves from the brain, and there cometh 
unto them many arteries and veins, and chiefly about 
the temples, the angles or corners of the eyes 
and the lips; in the cheeks is the chiefe beauty, 
thereby the complexion is most known, and (as 
Avicen saith) they shew also the affections and 
passions of the heart, waxing pale or red at the 
suddain joy or dread of the heart: of the face be 
two bones, two of the nose outwardly two of the 
upper mandible, one of the nether, three of the 
[^p.11^] 
nose within, in all ten. The parts of the mouth 
are five, the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the uvula, 
and pallat of the mouth; and first the lips are 
members official of musculous flesh, serving to the 
mouth as doores to an house, and helping the pronounciation 
of the speech; the teeth are likewise 
officiall, the hardest of all members, and are fastned 
to the cheek bones, serving to chew the meat 
and helping the pronountiation of the speech: 
They that have the whole number have two and 
thirty; the tongue is a carnous member, compound, 
of many nerves, ligaments, veines, and arteries, 
receiveth the tast, and pronounceth every 
speech, the flesh of the tongue is white, and hath 
in him nine muskles, the root of him is glandulous, 
wherein are two wels containing spettle to temper 
and keep moist the tongue; the uvula is of 
spongeous flesh, hanging down from the end of 
the pallate over the gutter of the throat, and is cold 
and dry, and oftentimes when there falleth rawnesse 
or much moistnesse into it from the head, then 
it hangeth down into the throat, and letteth a man 
to swallow; it helpeth the sound of the speech, 
the prolation of vomits, and tempereth the ayre 
that passeth to the lungs, and guideth the superfluities 
of the brain, which come from the coletures of the nose. 
 
The pallate of the mouth is a carnous pannicle, 
and the bones that be underneath it have two divisions, 
[^p.12^] 
one along the pallate, from the division of 
the nose, and from the opening of the other mandible, 
under the neither end of the pallate, lacking 
halfe an inch, and there it divideth overthwart 
and the first division is of the mandible, and the 
second is of the bone called Paxillary or Bazillary 
that sustains and bindeth all the other bones of the 
head together; the skin of the pallate of the mouth 
is of the inner part of the stomack, and of Myre 
and Isofagus, that is the way of the meat unto the 
stomack; also in the mouth is ended the uppermost 
extremity of the Wesand, which is called 
Mire or Isofagus, and with him is contained 
Trachia Arteria, viz. the passage of the ayre or 
breath, whose holes be covered with a lap like unto 
a tongue, and is gristly, that the meat and drink 
might slide over him into Isofagus, which is reared 
up when a man speaketh and covereth the way 
of the meat, and when a man swalloweth, then it 
covereth the way of the ayre, so that when one is 
open the other is covered; and thus much shall 
suffice for the Anatomy of the head and face, 
which is under the celestiall signe Aries. 
 
[^p.13^] 
[}CHAP. IV.}] 
 
[}Of the Neck.}] 
 
THe neck followeth next to be spoken of, 
which is contained between the head and the 
shoulders, and between the chin and the breast; 
in the neck be seven spondels, the first joyned unto 
the lower part of the head, and every spondell 
in like manner, the last of the seven is joyned unto 
the ridge of the back, and the ligaments that keep 
these spondels together are not so hard and tough 
as the ligaments of the back, but more feeble and 
subtle, because of the often moving of the neck; 
out of these seven spondels there spring seven pair 
of sinews, which be divided into the head, the 
shoulders and the armes: the Muskles of the neck 
(as Gallen saith) are twenty, moving the head and 
the neck; the third part of the neck is called gutter, 
which is the standing out of the throat bell, 
the fourth part gula, and the hinder part cernix 
so called, because of the marrow that commeth to 
the ridge bones, and it is (as it were) a servant to 
the brain, and receiveth of the brain the virtue of 
moving, and sendeth it by sinews to all the members 
of the body: Here also observe, that the way 
through which the meat passeth, or Isofagus 
stretcheth from the mouth to the stomack, and is 
[^p.14^] 
fastned to the spondels of the neck untill he come 
to the first spondell, and extendeth forward to the 
breast, and endeth at the mouth of the stomack; 
this wesand is compound, consisting of two tunicles 
or coats, the inner and the outer; the outer tunicle 
is simple, the inner is compound of musculous 
longitudinall will, whereby he draweth the meat 
into the stomack; also it is to be understood that 
the great veins which passe by the sides of the 
neck, to the upper part of the head, are called vena 
organices, of which the incision is dangerous; 
thus you see the neck is composed of skinny flesh, 
ligaments, and bones, and is under the dominion 
of the sign Taurus. 
 
[}CHAP. V.}] 
[}Of the Armes and Shoulders.}] 
 
IN the shoulder there be two bones, the shoulder 
bone and the cannell bone, the first is os spatula, 
or blade bone of the shoulder, whose hinder part 
declineth toward the chin, and in that end it is 
broad and thin, and in the upper part it is round; 
wherein in a concavity, called the box or coope of 
the shoulder, and which entereth the adjutor 
bones of the armes, and they are bound together 
with strong flexible sinews, and are contained fast 
[^p.15^] 
with clanicula, or the cannell bone, which bone 
extendeth to both the shoulders, one end to one 
shoulder, and another to the other, and there they 
make the composition of the shoulders; the bones 
of the armes from the shoulder to the fingers ends 
be thirty; the first is the adjutor bone of the arm, 
the upper end whereof entereth into the box of 
the shoulder bone, it is hollow and full of marrow, 
and extendeth to the elbow, where it hath 
two knobs in the juncture of the elbow, entering 
into a concavity proportioned, in the uppermost 
ends of the two fosell bones, lesse whereof goeth 
from the elbow to the thumb, by the upper 
part of the arme, and the greater neathermost from 
the elbow to the little finger; and these bones be 
joyned and bound together with the adjutor bone 
with strong ligaments, and likewise with the 
bones of the hand; the bones of the hand are eight, 
four uppermost and four neathermost, and in the 
palme of the hand five called ossa patinis, unto 
them are joyned the bones of the fingers and 
thumbes, in every finger three bones, and in the 
thumbe two; so that there is in the fingers and 
thumbe of every hand fourteen bones called ossa 
digitorum, in the palme of the hand five called patinis, 
and between the hand and the wrist eight, 
and from the wrist to the shoulder three bones, 
which in the whole numbred together are thirty, 
in each hand and arme, likewise there cometh from 
[^p.16^] 
Minuca, and the spondels of the neck four sinews, 
one cometh along the upper part of the arm, another 
passeth under the arme, one in the inner side, 
and another in the outer side of the arme, which 
bring unto the armes feeling and moving from 
the brain and minuca; now to speak of the veins 
and arteries of the arme, from venakelis springeth 
two branches, one runneth to one arme pit, the other 
to another, and there the branch is divided 
into two parts, or other branches, one goeth along 
the innerside of the arme, untill it commeth to the 
bought of the arme, and there it is called Bazillica 
or Epatica, and then goeth down the arme, till it 
come to the wrist, where it turneth to the back of 
the hand, and goeth between the little finger and 
the next, and there is called salvaltella; the other 
branch in the arme hole spreadeth to the utter side 
of the shoulder, where he divideth in two, the one 
goeth up spreading in the carnous part of the head 
and passeth through the bone into the veine; the 
other Branch runneth along the outward side of 
the arme, and there is divided into two also, the 
one part endeth at the hand, the other part foldeth 
about the arme, and in the bouget of the arme is 
called Sephalica, from thence it goeth to the back 
of the hand, appeareth between the thumbe and 
the forefinger and is there called Sephalica occularis, 
there are in the arme five principall veines 
from each of the two branches that I speak of, 
[^p.17^] 
which bee divided in the hinder part of the shoulders, 
springeth one vein, and those two meet together 
in the bought of the arme, and there is called 
Mediana, or Cordialis, or Commine, and of vena 
Sephalica springeth vena oculoris, and of vena Bazilica 
ariseth vena Salvetella, and of the two veins 
that meet there springeth vena mediana; and from 
these five principall veins there spring innumerable 
other small veins, but of them the Chyrurgion 
hath not so great charge; further you shall understand, 
that wheresoever there is found a vein, there 
is an Artery under him, if it be a great vein, there 
is a great Artery; and contrariwise, a little vein a 
little Artery, for wheresoever there goeth a vein to 
carry nutrimentall bloud, there also goeth an Artery, 
conveying the spirit of life. Therefore the Arteries 
lye deeper in the flesh then the veins do, and 
carry in them more pure and precious bloud, 
therefore he is further from outward danger then 
the veine, and is covered with two coats, the 
vein only with one: and thus much for the arms 
and shoulders, which are governed by the signe 
Gemini. 
 
[}CHAP. VI. 
Of the Breast, Heart, and Back.}] 
 
THe Breast or Thorax is the Ark or Chest of the 
spirituall members, where there are four parts 
[^p.18^] 
containing, and eight contained; the foure containing 
are the skin, musculous flesh, the paps, and 
bones; the parts contained are, the Heart, the 
Lungs, Panicles, Ligaments, Nervs, Veins, Arteries, 
Myre, or Isophagus. Of the skin and the flesh its 
spoken of before, but you must observe that the 
flesh of the paps differeth from the other flesh of 
the body, for it is white, glandulus, and spongeous; 
and there is in them both Nerves, Veins, 
and Arteries, & by them they have Coligaves with 
the heart, the liver, and brain, and the generative 
members. Also there is in the breast 80 or 90 
Muskles, some of them common to the neck, some 
to the shoulders, some to the Midriffe; some to 
the Ribs, some to the Back, some to the Breast 
it selfe; and in man the paps defend the spirituals 
from outward annoyance; and by their thicknesse 
they comfort the naturall heat; and in women 
there is the generation of milk, which commeth 
from the matrix to their breasts through many 
veins, that bring into them menstrual bloud, which 
is turned (by the digestive virtue) from red into 
white, like the colour of the paps, even as the 
stones turn the bloud into sperme of the same nature 
and colour of themselves so is the chile comming 
from the stomack to the Liver turned into 
the colour of the Liver: Now the bones of the 
breast are said to be triple of threefold, and they 
be numbred, seven in the breast before, and their 
[^p.19^] 
length is according to the breadth of the breast, and 
their ends be gristly, as the ribs be, and at the upper 
end of Thorax, is a hole or Concavity in which 
is set the foot of the Cannell bone, and at the lower 
end of Thorax against the mouth of the stomack, 
is a gristle called Ensi-forme, which defendeth 
the stomack from outward hurt; and giveth 
place to it in time of fulnesse when need requireth. 
Now to speak of the parts of the back behind, there 
are twelve spondels, through whom passeth minuca, 
of whom springeth 12 paire of Nerves, which 
bring feeling end moving to the muskles of the 
breast, and in each side there be twelve Ribs, seven 
true, and five false, which five are shorter then the 
other seven; and therefore called false Ribs. Of 
the parts that be inward, the heart is the principal, 
first, and beginner of life, he is the primum vivens, 
& ultimum moriens, and he is seated severally by 
himselfe, in the midst of the breast as Lord and 
King over all the members, and all the members 
receive their bloud of life from the heart; the substance 
of the heart is as it were Lazartus flesh, an 
officiall member spermatick, sending forth to every 
Member spirit of breath and heat, by his moving 
and stirring. The heart hath the shape and forme 
of a Pine-Apple, the broad end thereof is upwards, 
and the sharp end downwards, depending a little 
towards the left side. Also the hearth hath bloud in 
his substance, whereas all other me~bers have it but 
[^p.20^] 
in their veins and Arteries; and the heart is bound 
with certaine Ligaments to the backe part of the 
breast, but they touch not the substance of the heart, 
but in the overpart they spring out of him, and is 
fastned as aforesaid; further the heart hath two 
ventricles, or concavities, and the left is higher 
then the right, and in this hollownesse he keepeth 
the bloud for his nourishing, and the ayre to abate 
and temper the great heat he is in; likewise here 
observe, that to the right ventricle of the heart 
commeth a vein from venakelis that receiveth all 
the substance of bloud from the Liver to nourish 
the heart with, and the residue of it is made subtill 
through the vertue of the heart and then it passeth 
through the Concavity of the heart, and there 
is made hot and pure, and then it passeth into the 
left ventricle, and there is ingendred in it a spirit, 
that is cleare, bright, and subtile, and a meane between 
the body and the soule; further it is to be 
noter, that from the left ventrickle of the heart 
springeth two Arteries, the one having but one 
Coat, and is called Arteria venalis, which Artery 
carrieth bloud from the heart to the Lungs to give 
them nutriment, and bringeth ayre from the Lungs 
to the heart to refresh him with. The other Artery 
hath two Coats and is called vena Arterialis, and 
of him springeth all other Arteries that spread to 
every member of the body; and the spirit that is 
retained in them is the Instrument or treasure of 
[^p.21^] 
the soule, and at the braine he receiveth a further 
digestion, and there is made animall, and at the liver 
nutrimentall, and at the testicles or stones generative, 
and this Artery is also called the pulsative 
vein, or the beating veine. Also there is in the 
heart three pellicks, opening and closing the going 
in of the heart, bloud, and spirit, the heart hath 
likewise two little ears through whom passeth the 
ayre from the Lungs: The heart is also covered 
with a strong pannicle called Pericordium, unto 
which commeth nerves, as unto the other members, 
and this pannicle springeth of the upper panpannicle 
of the midriff. And from him springeth 
another pannicle which parteth the breast in the 
middle, and is called Mediastricum, and keepeth 
the Lungs that they fall not over the heart; there 
is also another Pannicle that covereth the Ribs inwardly 
of whom the midriffe hath his beginning. 
And thus much of the Breast and Heart, which are 
under the signes Cancer and Leo. 
 
[}CHAP. VII. 
Of the Lungs, Bowels, and Belly.}] 
 
THe Lungs is a member Spermatick of his first 
Creation, in his naturall complexion cold and 
dry, and accidentally cold and moyst, lapped in a 
[^p.22^] 
nervous pannicle, that it might gather together the 
softer substance of the Lungs; In the Lungs is three 
kinds of substance, one is a veine comming from 
the Liver, bringing the crude or raw part of the 
chile to feed the Lungs; another is arteria venalis 
comming from the heart, bringing with him the 
spirit of life to nourish him with; the third is, 
Trachia arteria, that bringeth in ayre to the 
Lungs. 
 
The Lungs is also divided into five Lobs, or 
Pellicles viz. three on the right side, and two on 
the left; so that if there fell any hurt to one, the 
other might supply his Office; so that the Lungs 
as a pair of Bellows draw cold winde and refresh 
the heart, change, alter, and purifie the Ayre, and 
do receive from the heart the superfluities which 
he putteth forth by his breathing. Behind the 
Lungs passeth Isofagus of whom its spoken before, 
and there passeth also veins and Arteries, and all 
these with trachia arteria do make a stoke repleat 
unto the gullet, with Pannicles, strong Ligaments, 
and glandulus flesh to fulfill the voyd places. And 
last of all is the Midriff, which is an officiall member 
made of two Pannicles, and Lazartus flesh, and 
is placed in the midst of the body overthwart under 
the region of the spirituall members, parting 
them from the matrix; and it divideth the spirituals 
from the nutrales, and keepeth the malicious 
fumes from ascending upwards to annoy the spirituals 
[^p.23^] 
or vitall. Next followeth the womb which 
is the Region of all the intrailes, and reacheth from 
the midriffe down to the share inwardly, and outwardly 
from the reines or kidneyes downe to the 
bone Pecten, about the privy parts: and this 
wound is compound made of two things, viz of 
Syfac and Myrac: Syfac is a member spermatick, 
officiall, sensible, sinnowy, cold and dry, and hath 
his beginning at the inner Pannicle of the Midriff, 
and it containeth and bindeth together all the intrails, 
defendeth the musculus, so that he oppress 
not the naturall members: Myrac is compound; 
and made of foure things, viz. of skin outwardly, 
of fatnesse, of a carnous Pannicle and of musculus 
flesh, and all the whole from Syfac outward is called 
Myrac, and in this Myrac, or outer part of 
the womb, there is noter eight Muskles, two longitudinals, 
proceeding from the shield of the stomack 
unto os pecten, two Longitudinalls comming 
from the backwards to the womb, and four 
transverse, two whereof spring from the ribs on 
the right side, and go to the left side to the bones 
of the Haunches, or of pecten; and the other two 
spring from the ribs on the left, and come over the 
womb to the right parts. Here note, that by the 
musculus longitudinall, is made perfect the virtue 
attractive, and by the musculus transverse, the virtue 
retentive, and by the musculus latitudinall the 
virtue expulsive, and by the virtue attractive is 
[^p.24^] 
drawn downe to the intrailes all the superfluities, 
both water, winde, and dirt; by the virtue retentive 
all things are holden and kept untill nature 
hath wrought his kinde; and by the vertue expulsive 
is put forth all things when nature provoketh 
any thing to be done. Now to come to the parts 
contained within: first that which appeareth next 
under the Syfac is omentum or Zirbus, which is a 
pannicle covering the stomack and intrails, implanted 
with many veins and arteries, and fatnesse 
to keep moyst the inward parts. This Zirbus is 
an officiall member, and is compound of a veine 
and an Artery, which entreth and maketh a line 
of the utter tunicle of the stomack, unto which tunicle 
hangeth the Zirbus and covereth all the guts 
down to the share; next to Zirbus appeareth the 
intrails or guts, which convey the drosse of the 
meat and drink, and cleanse the body of their superfluities: 
There be six portions of one whole 
gut, which beginneth at the neither mouth of the 
stomack, and continueth to the end of the fundament: 
neverthelesse he hath divers shapes and 
formes, divers operations, and divers names. And 
as the stomack hath two tunicles, so have all the 
guts two tunicles; the first portion of the guts is 
called Duodenum, he is twelve inches of length, 
and covereth the neither part of the stomack, and 
receiveth all the drosse of the stomack: the second 
is called Jejunium, for he is evermore empty, for 
[^p.25^] 
to him lyeth the chest of the gall, and beateth him 
sore, and draweth all the drosse out of him, and 
cleanseth him: the third is called Yleon, or small 
gut, and is in length fifteen or sixteen Cubits; in 
this gut oftentimes falleth a disease called Yleaca 
passio: the fourth gut is called Monoculus, or 
blind gut, and seemeth to have but one hole or 
mouth, one neare unto the other, for by the one all 
things go in, and by the other they go out again; 
the first is called Colon, and receiveth all the drosse 
comming from all profitablenesse, and there commeth 
not to him any veins miseraices as to the other: 
the sixth and last is called rectum or longam, 
and endeth in the fundament, and hath in his nether 
end foure muscles, to hold, to open, to shut, 
and to put out, &c. Next to be noted is Misenterium, 
which is a texture of innumerable veines 
miseraices, ramefied of one veine called Porta Epates, 
covered and defended of pannicles and ligaments 
comming to the intrails, with the backe 
full of Ligaments, and grandulus flesh. 
 
The stomack is compound and spermatick, sinowy 
and sensible, and therein is made the first digestion 
of Chile; for if it faile in his working, all 
the members of the body shall corrupt; wherefore 
Gallen saith, that the stomack should be to all 
the members of the body as the earth is to all that 
are ingendred of the earth, viz. that it should desire 
meat for all the body, and that it should be as 
[^p.26^] 
a sack or chest to all the body for meat, and as a 
Cooke to all the members of the body; it is made 
of two pannicles, the inner is nervous, and the 
outer carnous; this inner pannicle hath musculus 
longitudinals that stretcheth along from the stomack 
to the mouth, whereby he draweth meat 
and drink to him as it were with hands; and he 
hath transverse will to with-hold or make retention; 
and the outer pannicle hath latitudinall will 
to expulse and put out, and by his heat helpeth the 
digestive virtue of the stomack, and by other heats 
given him of his neighbour, as the Liver on the 
right side, chafing, and heating him with his 
lobs or figures, the spleene on the left side sending 
to him melancholly to excercise his appetites, 
and about him is the heart quickening him with 
his Arteries; also the braine, sending to him a 
branch of nerves, to give him feeling; and he hath 
on the hinder part descending of the parts of the 
back many ligaments, with the which he is bound 
to the spondels of the back. 
 
The forme of the stomack is in likenesse of a 
Gourd, crooked; both holes be in the upper part 
of the body of it, because there should be no going 
out unadvisedly of those things that be received into 
it. The stomack is subject to many passions, 
and the nether mouth thereof is narrower then 
the upper for three causes. 1. Because the upper 
receiveth meat great in substance, and there being 
[^p.27^] 
fine and subtill, passeth easier into the nether. 
2. By it passeth all the chilosity of the meat from 
the stomack to the Liver. And 3. through him 
passeth all the drosse of the stomack into the guts. 
And thus much for the stomack which is likewise 
under the signe Cancer, and the Bowels under 
Virgo. 
 
Next followeth the Liver to be spoken of, which 
is a principall member, officiall, spermatick, compleat 
in quantity of bloud, of himselfe insensible, 
but sensible by accidents, and in him is made the 
second concoction; he is inclosed in a sinnewy 
pannicle, and cruded, turneth the chile, that runneth 
from the stomack to the Liver, into the colour 
of bloud. In the Liver is ingendred all nutrimentall: 
the seat of the Liver is under the false 
Ribs in the right side; the form thereof is bunchy 
in the backside, and it is somewhat hollow like the 
inside of an hand, plyable to the stomack as an hand 
is to an apple, and doth comfort the digestion 
thereof, heating the stomack as a fire doth a pot or 
Chauldron that hangeth over it: likewise the Liver 
is bound with Pellicles and strong Ligaments 
to Diafragma or the Midriffe; also he hath Colligaves 
with the stomack, intrails, with the heart 
reigns, testicles, and other members; and in him 
are five pellicles like five fingers: Gallen calleth 
the Liver Mesasanguinaria, and here are the places 
of the foure Humours, viz. Bloud, or sanguine in 
[^p.28^] 
the Liver, Choller in the Gall, Melancholly in the 
Spleen, and Flegme in the Lungs; the watry superfluities 
to the Reins and these four humours are 
thus distributed, from the spermatick matter of the 
Liver are ingendred two great veins, the greatest 
is called Porta, of whom springeth the miseraick 
veins, which are to vena Porta, as the branches of 
a tree are to the tree it selfe, some of them be contained 
with Duodenum, some with Jejunium, some 
with Yleon, some with Monoculus, or Saccus; and 
from all these guts they bring to vena porta the 
succosity of chile, going to the stomack, distributing 
it to the substance of the Liver, and in these 
miseraick, veins are begun the second concoction, 
which is ended in the Liver So that this vena porta, 
spreading it sefe through the gibbous part of 
the Liver, meet all in one, and there maketh the second 
great veine called Concava, or vena Ramosa, 
and he with his branches draweth all the bloud ingendred 
from the Liver, and with his branches 
conveys it to all the members of the body, wherein 
is made perfect the third concoction. Now to 
speake of the Chest or Gall, it is an officiall member, 
spermatick and sinowy, as a purse or panniculer 
vesicke, in the holownesse of the Liver, about 
the middle pericle or lob, ordained to receive the 
cholerick superfluities ingendred in the Liver: and 
in the purse or bag of the Gall are contained three 
holes, the first receiveth the Cholerick substance 
[^p.29^] 
of the bloud, that the bloud be not hurt by the choler; 
the second sendeth Choler to the bottome of 
the stomack to further the digestion; and by the 
third neck he sendeth to the guts choler to cleanse 
them of their superfluities and drosse; next is the 
Spleen, or the milt, which is spermatick, and is the 
receptacle of the melancholy superfluities ingendred 
in the Liver; he is placed on the left side 
transversely linked to the stomack, he is thin of 
substance, and purifieth the nutritive bloud from 
the drosse of melancholy. 
 
And next it is to be observed, that within the 
Region of the Nutrites, backwards, the kidneys 
are ordained, to cleanse the bloud from the watry 
superfluities, they have in each of them two passages, 
by the one is drawne the water from Venakelis, 
by two veins, called vena emulgentes, by the 
other the same water is conveyed to the bladder, 
and is called poros urithides. The substance of the 
Kidneys is Lazartus, longitudinall, placed behind 
on each side of the spondels, they are two in number, 
the right Kidney lying higher then the left, 
and are bound to the back with Ligaments, they 
are full of hard concavities, therefore the sores of 
them are difficult to cure; there commeth also 
from the Heart to the Kidneys an Artery bringing 
with him bloud, heat, spirit and life; and a vein 
from the Liver, bringing bloud nutrimentall to 
nourish them withall. 
 
[^p.30^] 
The fat of the Kidneys is made or congealed of 
thin bloud of great quantity, serving to temper 
the heat of the Kidneys, which they have by the 
sharpnesse of the Urine. And thus much sufficeth 
to speake of the Reins and Bowels, the one being 
ruled by the signe Libra, the other under the dominion 
of Virgo. 
 
[}CHAP. VIII. 
Of the Buttocks, Haunches, and Secret-Members.}] 
 
THese are the lower parts of the Womb or Belly, 
and are adjoyning to the Thighs and Secret 
Members. Herein is to be noted the parts 
containing, the parts contained, and the parts proceeding 
outwards; the parts containing are Myrac, 
Syfac, Zirbus, and Bones; the parts contained 
are the Vesick or Bladder, the spermatick vessels, 
the Matrix, and Vulva in Women; the Longoan, 
the Yard, Testicles, or Stones and Cods in men, 
Nerves, Veines, and Arteries, descending downwards, 
the Buttocks and Muscles descending to the 
Thighes; of which in order. 
 
First of the parts containing, as Myrac, Syfac, 
and Zirbus, of which it is spoken already; but as 
for the bones of the Haunches, there be of the parts 
[^p.31^] 
of the back three spondels of ossa sacri, or the Haunches; 
and three Cartaliginis spondels of ossa caude, 
or the Tayle bone: Thus there is in every man 
thirty spondels, viz. in the neck seven, in the ridge 
twelve, in the reins five, in the Haunches six; and 
every spondell is hollow in the midst, through 
which spondell passeth Nuca from the braine, or 
the marrow of the back, and each of these spondels 
are bound fast one with another, so that one 
of them may not well be named without another: 
And all these spondels together contained one by 
another, is called the ridge bone, which is the 
foundation of the shape of the body. They bee 
joyned to the bones of the haunches, and be the 
upholders of all the spondels; and these bones 
bee small towards the Tayle bone, and broad 
towards the Haunches, and before they 
are joyned and make os pectenis, each of 
these two bones towards the Liver, hath a great 
round hole, into which is received the bone called 
vertebra, or the whirle bone: also besides that 
place, there is a great hole or way, through which 
passeth from above musculus veins and Arteries, 
and goe into the thighs. And thus of this bone 
Pecten, and of vertebra, is formed the Juncture of 
the thigh. 
 
Now concerning the parts contained, the first 
is the bladder a member officiall compound of two 
nervous pannicles, in complexion cold and dry; 
[^p.32^] 
the neck of the bladder is carnous, and hath muscles 
to with-hold, and to let goe, and in man 
it is long, contained with the yard, passing through 
peritonium, but in women it is shorter, and is contained 
within the vulva. It is placed in men between 
the bone of the share and longoan, and in 
women between the said bone and the matrix; 
and in it are implanted two long vessels comming 
from the kidneys, called porri, urickides, bringing 
with them the urine or water from the kidneys to 
the bladder, which privily entreth into the holes 
of the pannicles of the bladder, by a naturall moeing 
between Tunicle and Tunicle, and there the 
urine findeth the hole of the nether Tunicle, and 
there it entreth privily into the holes of the concavity 
of the bladder, and the more the bladder is 
filled with the urine, the straighter the holes thereof 
be comprised together; and the holes of the 
Tunicles be not one even against another, therefore 
if the bladder be never so full, there can none goe 
back againe: The forme of it is round, in some 
bigger, and in some lesse. 
 
There is also two other vessels called Vasa seminaria, 
or the spermatick vessels, and they come 
from Venakelis, bringing bloud to the Testicles, 
aswell in man as in women, which by the further 
digestion of the Stones or Testicles is made Sperm 
or Nature: In men they be put outward, for their 
Testicles hang without, and in women they be inward, 
[^p.33^] 
for their Testicles stand within. Next followeth 
the matrix in women, which is an officiall 
member, compound and nervous, cold and dry in 
complexion, it is the field of mans generation, it 
is an instrument susceptive, that is receiving or 
taking, for as the Adamant draweth or attracteth 
the Iron, so the matrix in the seed of man, 
and Aristotle maketh mention of a Maid that standing 
in a Bath where some seed of man had been 
spilt, drew it unto her and conceived thereby; her 
proper place is between the Bladder and Longoan, 
the similitude or likeness of it, as it were a yard 
reversed or turned inward, having Testicles likewise 
within as aforesaid, and is outwardly adorned 
with haires, in them that be of ripe age; it hath 
two concavities or Cells, it also hath a long neck 
like a Urinall, and in every neck it hath a mouth, 
one within, and another without; the inner in the 
time of conception is shut, and the outer open as 
it was before; it hath in the midst a Lazartus pannicle 
called Tengito, wherein is two utilities, the 
first is, by it goeth forth the urine which else would 
be shed throughout all the vulva. 2. By it the 
Ayre that commeth to the matrix is altered and 
the heat tempered. 
 
Furthermore, in the Concavity of this neck is 
many involutions and pleats, joyned together in 
the manner of Rose leaves, before they be fully 
spread or blowne, and they be shut together like a 
[^p.34^] 
purse mouth, so that nothing may passe forth but 
urine untill the time of Childing. Also about the 
middle of this purse be certaine veins in maidens, 
which in time of deflowring be corrupted and broken, 
and these are called the Tokens of Virginity. 
Furthermore in the sides of the outer mouth, are 
two Testicles or stones, and two vessels of sperme, 
shorter then mans vessels, and in time of Coyt or 
copulation, the womans sperme is shed down into 
the bottome of the matrix, also from the Liver 
there commeth to the matrix many veins, bringing 
nutriment to the child, when a woman is with 
child, and those veines, when the matrix is 
voyd, bring thereto superfluities from certaine 
members of the body, whereof are ingendred womens 
flowers, &c. 
 
Now in the matrix, which is the field of generation, 
is sowne by the tillage of man, a convenable 
matter of kindly heat, which seed of generation 
commeth from all parts of the body, both of 
man and woman, with the consent of all the members, 
and is shed in the place of conceiving, and by 
the vertue of nature, is gathered together in the 
Cels of the matrix, in whom by the working of 
the mans seed, and by the suffering of the womans 
seed mixt together, is ingendred Embryon. 
And further it is to be noted, that this sperme that 
commeth both to man and woman, is made of the 
most pure drops of bloud in all the body, and by 
[^p.35^] 
the chafing or labour of the stones, this bloud is 
turned into another kind, and is made sperme, and 
in man it is hot, white and thick, that it cannot 
run abroad of it selfe, but taketh temperature of 
the womans, which is thinner, colder, and feebler; 
and as Rennet of the Cheese hath by himselfe the 
vertue of working, and the milk of suffering, so 
the sperme of man and woman make the generation 
of Embrion, which is lapped in a Caule and tied 
to the mothers womb, untill it commeth forth 
with the birth of the child; so that of this Embrion 
is ingendred first the principalls, as the heart, 
the liver, and brain, and of the heart springeth the 
Arteries of the liver the veines, and of the braine 
the nerves, and when these are made, nature shapeth 
bones and gristles to keep and save them, as 
the bones of the head for the braine, the breast 
bones and ribs for the heart and liver, and after 
these springeth all other members one after another. 
 
And thus is the child shaped in the wombe in 
foure degrees, viz. six dayes the seed remaineth as 
milke, then it is turned into a lump of bloud, and so 
remaineth nine dayes, and thirdly into a lump of 
flesh ingendring the principals the space of nine 
dayes, and fourthly unto the time of perfection of 
all the members is eighteen dayes. 
 
Now to speake of the Haunches, we come to 
Longoan, or the tayle gut, which is paniculer, as 
[^p.36^] 
the other Bowels, the length of it as of a span 
stretching nigh unto the Raynes, his nether part is 
called Annis, that is the Tewell, and about him 
is found two muscles, one to open, and the other to 
shut; also there is in him five veines, or branches 
of veins, called vena Emoraidales, they have Coligaves 
with the bladder, and are partners in their 
griefs. Now the parts proceeding outwardly, are 
Didimus, Peritonium, the Yard, Testicles, or 
Stones, and Buttocks,: First, of mans generative 
Members, the yard dureth from Peritonium, which 
place is from the Cods to the fundament, whereupon 
is a seame parting the Cod in the midst; the 
yard is an officiall member, the tiller of mans generation, 
compound and made of skin, brawnes, 
tendons, veins, arteries, sinnews, and great ligaments; 
and it hath in it two passages, or principal 
Issues, one for the sperm, another for the urine. 
The quantity of a common yard is 8 or 9 inches, 
with bigness proportioned to the quantity of the 
matrix. Also the skin of the yard about the head 
is double, and called Prepusium, this skin is moveable, 
for through his consecration the spermatick 
matter is made better, and sooner cast forth from 
the Testicles or stones, and by it is had the more 
delectation in the doing; the foremost part of the 
head of the yard before is made of Brawny flesh, 
which if it be once lost, never groweth againe, but 
it may be well skinned and whole. 
 
[^p.37^] 
The Cods is a compound member, and officiall, 
and as a purse ordained for the custody and comfort 
of the stones, and other spermatick vessels, it 
is made of two parts, the inner and the outer, the 
outer is compound made of skin and Lazartus, longitudinall 
and transversall, as the Myrach, the inner 
part of the Cods is of the substance as the Syfac, 
and in similitude as two pockets drawn together, 
they differ not from the Syfac; and there be two, 
if there fall any hurt to the one, the other should 
serve; the stones be two, made of glandulus or 
carnelly flesh, and through the Didimus commeth 
from the braine to the stones sinnewes, and 
from the heart Arteries, and from the Liver 
veins, which bringeth unto them both feeling and 
stirring life and spirit, and nutrimentall bloud, and 
the purest bloud of all other members of the body, 
whereof is made the sperme, by the labour of the 
Testicles or stones ut supra. 
 
The groyns be the emy Junctures, or purging 
places unto the Liver, and they have carnelly flesh 
in the plying or bowing of the thighs. 
 
The hips have great brawny flesh on them, and 
from thence descend downwards Brawns, Cords, 
and Ligaments, moving and binding together the 
thighes with the Buttocks or hanches themselves. 
 
[^p.38^] 
[}CHAP. IX 
Of the Thighes, Legs, and Feet.}] 
 
THe thigh or Coxa is contained from the joynt 
of the haunch unto the knee; the leg reacheth 
from the knee to the ankle, and is called Tibia; 
& the foot from the ankle unto the end of the toes; 
the Thigh, Leg, and Foot are compound, made as 
the arme and hand, with skin, flesh, veines, arteries, 
sinews, brawns, tendons, and cords, wherof 
in order. 
 
Of the skin and flesh it's spoken of before; and 
as of veins and arteries, in their descending downwards, 
at the last spondels they be divided into 2 
parts, whereof the one part goeth into the right 
thigh, and the other into the left, and when 
they come to the thigh, they be divided into two 
parts, or branches; one of them spreadeth into 
the inner side of the leg, and the other into the 
outer side, and so branching descend down to the 
Leg, Ankles, and Feet, and be brought into foure 
veines, which be commonly used in bloud letting, 
as hereafter followeth; one of them is under the 
under Ankle towards the heele, called Soffina; 
another under the under Ankle, and is called Siatica, 
and another under the ham, called Poplitica; 
the fourth betweene the little Toe and the next, 
called Renalis. The sinnewes spring of the last 
spondel, and of Os sacrum, and passeth through 
[^p.39^] 
the hole of the bone of the hip, and descendeth to 
the brawnes, and moveth the knee and the ham, 
and these descend downe to the Ankle, and move 
the foote, and the brawnes of the foote 
moove the toes, as is declared in the bones of 
the hand; the thigh bone, or Coxa, is without a 
fellow, and full of marrow, and round at either 
end; the roundnesse at upper end is called Vertebrum, 
or whirlbone, and boweth inwards, and is 
received into the box or hole of the haunch bone, 
and at the knee he hath two rounds, which he receiveth 
into the Concavities of the bones of the 
leg, at the knee, called the great fossels. 
 
There is also at the knee a round bone, called 
the knee-pan; then followeth the leg, wherein 
is two bones called focile major, and focile minor, 
the bigger of them passeth before, and is called the 
shin bone, and passeth downe making the inward 
ankle; the lesse passeth from the knee backwards, 
and descendeth downe to the outer ankle, and 
there formeth that ankle. 
 
The bones of the foot are six and twenty; first 
next the ankle bone is one called Orabalistus; next 
under that towards the heele, is one called Calcany: 
and betweene them is another bone, called 
Os naculare; in the second ward there bee foure 
bones valled Raceti, as bee in the hands: In the 
third and fourth wards be fourteene, called Digitori, 
and five called Pectens, at the extremity of the 
[^p.40^] 
Toes, next to the nailes: And thus be there in the 
foot 26 bones, with the leg from the ankle to the 
knee; 2 in the knee, and one round and flat bone, 
and in the thigh one; in the whole, thigh, leg, and 
foot, thirty bones: Thus are we marvelously and 
curiously wrought in the nethermost parts of the 
earth.
