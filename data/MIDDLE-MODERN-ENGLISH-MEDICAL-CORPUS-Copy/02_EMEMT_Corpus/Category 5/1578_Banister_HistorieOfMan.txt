[}OF THE HISTORY OF MAN, 
the first Booke. 
OF 
Bones, the frame of the Body.}] 
 
AS the good and expert Architect, hath 
[/1./] 
a singular care, first in edifying his house, to be 
[/2./] 
well aduised of the maner of his foundation, and 
heedy framyng of his Timberworke, before he 
lay on Thack, Tile, Slate, Lime, or Plaster: 
So it behoueth vs, in searchyng the true Secresie 
of this Misterious Science, and body of Man, 
first, before the partes supported, distinctly, and 
deliberatly, with diligent care, to consider the 
partes supporting. And the reason is good. For 
[/3./] 
if you doe not first exactely examine, and to a sufficient 
fulnes feede your appetite, with the diligent 
peruse of this History of Bones: you shall 
finde the rest of this booke, not onely in readyng vnsauery, but also to your sensible 
vnderstandyng very obscure. Wherfore of the Bones of mans body, what 
they are, and how they are constrewed, and combinated, after all manner order 
of knitting, & articular motion, the good Phisition (sayth Galene) ought not to 
[/4./] 
be ignoraunt. But amongeth all things to the arte of Medicine appertinent, that 
[/5./] 
thing that is accordyng to Nature (as the scoape whereto we ought to cleaue) we 
must study to concerue and know. The Bones therefore, by very right we call 
the foundation of the body, since they not onely make firme the partes, but also 
[/6./] 
sustayne and support the body. Then that we in this our first enterprise intreate 
of Bones, it neither seemeth voyde of much authorized maintenaunce, neither 
yet frustrate of the splendant sparke of reason, which shall light ech mans iudgement 
[/7./] 
into the right conducted way of truth. These therefore are the wordes of 
Vesalius. All the partes of mans body are either Similar, or Simple, with sence, as 
are Ligamentes, Fibres, Membrans, Flesh, and Fatte: or els Dissimilar, or Instrumentall, 
as the Veine, Artery, Sinew, Muscle, Finger, and other Organs of 
the whole body: which are made so much the more instrumentall, by how much 
[/8./] 
the greater store of Similar partes with the instrumentall are compounded. As 
for example, the handes & head & c. The Bones are of all the partes of the body 
most hard, & dry, of earthy substance, cold, & voyde of sence, the teeth onely excepted. 
[/9./] 
But here you must vnderstand, that they are not accou~ted voyde of feeling, 
because they are most of y=e= terrestriall element, but because no portio~ of sinewes, 
which are the immediate organs of sence, is in their substaunce disseminated. 
[/10./] 
 
Neither was it the mighty pleasure of God (whom we call Nature) nor any 
parcell of his decree, that the substaunce of the bones at all should be made sensible, 
[/11./] 
as any reasonable man must of force confesse, if he note but how the whole 
mole, and pack of members are sustayned by them: who with their many motions, 
do carry, and recarry all the other parts of the body with them, which argueth, 
that if they were (as some say) delighted with the perfection of feelyng, then 
[/12./] 
the moitiue vertue of the members would by exceedyng payne be taken away, 
or els at least frustrate. Wherefore it is odious to heare them, that blushe not 
[/13./] 
obstinately to affirme, that in bones is conteyned a singular sharpnes of sence, 
when as neither reason can rule them, nor experience satisfie them. For belike 
[^f.1v^] 
they will either proue that the Bones are the originall of Nerues, and so consequently 
[/14./] 
of the brayne: or els that the Bones are produced and made of the matter 
of the brayne, and so to be sensible as the Nerues, whiche are the organs of 
sence, as shal sufficiently be declared vnto you in their proper description. But 
yet further to confute their vnshamefastnesse, the Good Artiste, who in his lyfe 
tyme, & dayes of experience, [/15./] either scaleth, cantrizeth, or seperateth Bones, is 
able to testifie aboundantly that after he passeth (in his operation) Periosteon, 
the party is no longer vexed, with such payne as appertayneth to the sensible 
partes. This [^GREEK OMITTED^] (for so it is termed of the Greekes, the [/16./] Latines haue 
[/17./] 
not knowen it) is a certaine Membrane, that enwrappeth, & cloatheth the bones, 
by the benefite of which Membrane, and not of their owne proper Nature, the 
Bones are supposed to feele, although in deed they doe nothing lesse: for that once 
[/18./] abraced, or taken of fro~ the bone, neither can they by sence afterward discerne, 
whether you cut, burne, deuide, or otherwise at your pleasure handle the~. Wherfore 
it is a shame if we otherwise affirme: but with Gal. Vesal. and Col. conclude, 
that Bones of their own proper Nature are altogether destitute of sence, except 
(as I sayd before) the teeth onely which are approued sensible, as experience our 
Scholemaistres teacheth vs. 
 
Now as touchyng the proper differences of Bones [/19./] this is the first, that 
they differ not only in names (when as euery one chalenge to themselues proper 
names) but also in magnitude, some beyng [/20./] small, and others greater. Agayne 
in fourme, as some long, some short, diuers triangled, others quadrangled, [/21./] &c. 
Or otherwise accordyng to the figure: as smooth, or rough, defended with processes, 
or hauyng appendances: some distinguished by commissures, others also 
otherwise. Moreouer they are distinguished by their vses: Since to one onely 
function or common office, all were not ordayned, which argueth also the great 
diuersitie of their fashions & fourmed shapes. For some are playnly hollow, neither 
alike: but some of them with more large scope, others also straiter, yet not 
prouing the bone either larger or lesser therby: when as [/22./] some beyng great haue 
no manifest hollownesse in them, as for example: The bones committed to os Sacrum, 
os Sacrum it selfe, the Scapple bones, & others named in their places. Some 
agayne are [/23./] small, but much hollow, as the bones of the fingers co~trary to Galene, 
as we will proue in their propper place. Andræas Uesalius also supposed 
that neither the bones of the nose, and [/24./] Sesaminæ, neither the little Ossicles that 
constitute the organ of hearyng, should be otherwise then made of massiue Soliditie. 
Which (notwithstanding) Collumbus doubteth not to denye: for proofe 
wherof (sayth he) breake one of them, either greene, or dryed, and you shall finde 
the substance therof spongie, not vnlike a thicke Pummie stone. And these bones 
also although they seeme so Solid, shew in the outward partes of themselues certaine 
[/25./] 
holes, some greater, and others lesse, as is to be sene in the Brachiall teeth, 
and many other bones of the fingers: which the Diuine creator hath commau~ded 
to be Perforated. Therfore euide~t ynough those holes are not in vayne, they 
giuyng place to the veines and bloud for nourishment as also to the Arteries for 
their vitall heate: whereas such as haue no holes, to admit within them, either 
[/26./] 
veines or Arteries, such we say are nourished, and fed by the partes adiacent. 
 
Now forasmuch as in this our narratio~ of bones, diuers straunge names, & 
such as to the simpler sorte are altogether vnknowen, be here & there scattered: 
It shalbe very conuenient before hand, briefly to table out an expositio~ of them: 
That therby the reading of such in their places (being now first cracked and shaled 
from their obscure Huskes) may be more porspicuous, and pleasaunt to your 
contemplation: which otherwise would be loadsom, and tedious. 
 
[/27./] 
And first to begin, we will say what is vnderstood by this word Appendance, 
[^f.2r^] 
which the Greekes call [^GREEK OMITTED^]. It is nothyng els, saue a bone springyng to a 
bone: or rather an addition or coagmentation of some bone, obteinyng a peculiar 
circumscription, yet not beyng a trew portion of that bone, whereto it is 
committed. In yong creatures therfore it is easely discerned, but in older and 
[/28./] 
greater more hardly: for triall wherof, if you boile the bones of a kid, or lambe 
or veale, you shall easely see certaine portions, & endes of them, to deuide, either 
by them selues, or els with small constreinte. And those Particles so annexed to 
the bones, are called Appendances: which (contrary to the mynde of Galen) we 
[/29./] 
must needes affirme to be softer then the bones them selues: since we delite oft 
tymes with our teeth, to plucke the Appendances of small Bones, & to chewe of 
them in our mouthes: for the pleasaunt iuyce that often they retaine. Which 
[/30./] 
contrariwise we cannot do to the bone. Neither are they lightly to be losed, or 
deuided from the bones, by euery motion: for that nature hath so well prouided 
for the turnyng of the ioyntes, with such softe and slipperie Cartilages, as therby 
in the motion of the bones, no occasion can be giuen, by any straigne to iniurie 
[/31./] 
them. The vse and chief commoditie of them, is excellently recited of Collumbus: 
or rather inuented: and so as no man hath fully hitherto iudged: although 
[/32./] 
the thyng be worthy knowyng, and exceedyng necessary. And one thyng among 
many others hee testifieth, that nature hath made nothyng in vayne, but euery 
part to good purpose, and seruyng to some vse. Realdus I say therfore found, 
that Appendances were in that order to the bones annexed, to the end that from 
the place of their coniunction, Ligamentes might be produced and made, to stre~gthen, 
hold, and stablish firmely, the composition and knittyng of the ioyntes: as 
you see the toppe of the thighe, with the bone of the hippe: and the neither part 
of it, with the bone of the legge. Likewise the bone of the shoulder, with the 
[/33./] 
scaple bone: and that which in like sort is tyed to Radius and Vlua. As for those 
bones that haue no Appendances, how they are vnited. I referre you to the History 
of Ligamentes to finde. And not onely where the ioynts are; do these Ligamentes, 
[/34./] 
spryng, but where no Coarticulatio~ is made also: as in Ilium, the Scaple 
bones, & some processes of the Vertebres. Thence also proceede Ligamentes, necessarily 
chauncyng to y=e= framyng of the good constitution of Muscles, as in their 
proper place is to be sought. Whereby it commeth, that from thence very many 
[/35./] 
Muscles haue their begynnings, whence also Ligamentall Cartilages proceede: 
for so we thinke it good to call them, that to strenghthe~ the Muscles, are amongest 
[/36./] 
them disseminated: endyng also at their Tendans. Now agayne it is manifest, 
that Galen (for all his industrious search) fayled to finde the truth, in affirmyng 
these Appendances to be added to the bones, for the conseruation of the marey, 
with in them included: but then sayth Vesal. Now hapneth it, that other bones, 
[/37./] 
in whiche are no cauities so notably allotted to the reteinyng of marey, should 
(notwithstanding) also haue proper Appenda~ces: euen as those, that are greatly 
hollowed. As for example the scapple bones, the Vertebres, & other small bones, 
[/38./] 
which not beyng much medullous, are neuerthelesse not of Appendances destitute. 
But pretermittyng this conuict assertion of Galen, it is sufficient, that the 
[/39./] 
truth is touched by the aforesayd reasons of Col. prouyng how. Ligame~tes by Appendances 
are most engendred, and consequently the two proper gifs giuen vnto 
Ligamentes. Which, whilese they are so necessary, as we haue proued, that the 
[/40./] 
generation of Appendances be very vtile, and profitable, who ca~ inuent to deny: 
since their vses Sublated, but a fewe places can you finde, whence Ligamentes 
should fittly proceede. And thus much you haue to vnderstand, as oft as you read 
of Appendances: in what bone or part so euer it be. 
 
[/41./] 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] which the Latin interpretours call Processus, is thus: whe~ a bone in 
any part, stretcheth forth his substance in excreasing maner, as a knot swellyng 
[^f.2v^] 
out from the stocke of a tree, or as some Gibbous Tumour exceedyng the height of 
[/42./] 
the naturall places nere vnto it: so such places of bones, as are apparantly to be 
discerned to exceede other partes, are rightly called Processes, sufficiently differing 
from the Appendances: for these are right parcels, and true partes of the 
[/43./] 
bones them selues, whereto they are fastened. Also Appendances themselues 
[/44./] 
haue Processes. As the bone of the cubite called Vlna, and the inferior part of Tibia: 
as also other bones diuers: as will appeare to you plenteously hereafter. Agayn, 
[/45./] 
to some processes Appenda~ces cleaue, for the interior processe of the Scapple 
bone that is like the fashion of an anker, and the ridge of the Scapple bone 
[/46./] 
which in like manner is a processe therof, haue Appendances: but note that the 
[/47./] 
processes of the thighe called Trochanteres, or Rotatores, are more iustly to be termed 
Appendances, then thynges with Appendances munited. For all that part 
that swelleth fort (whiche therfore they call Processes) holdeth the place of an 
Appendance, so that the Processe and Appendance there, is all one thyng. Yet 
Vesalius made a difference betwene them: but when as by takyng away the Appendances, 
[/48./] 
the Processes also are gone, we must Iudge (saith Columbus) them in 
that place all one: and the Processe, & the Appendance, the same thyng, one that 
[/49./] 
the other is. Furthermore the Processe and Appendance differ thus. For it is a 
very small bone, out of which appeareth no Processe, neither may it be possible 
[/50./] 
almost, to finde such one, as exceedeth in no place: but there are many bones destitute 
of Appendances, as those of the head, of the vpper iawe, of the wreste, and 
[/51./] 
such other. Neither do the Processes not differ in them selues, chusing ech one a 
sundry shape: for some of them are small, and like the fashion of a sharpe bodkin: 
[/52./] 
wherfore the Grecians call such Processes, Styloides. Others also beyng sharpe 
but not so slender; as the knagge of a hartes horne, that is to say thicke and pointyng, 
such as are to be found in the neither iawe: Galena calleth such Corona Processus. 
But besides, there are some that represent the similitude of an anker, as 
the interior Processes of the shoulder blades, called Anchiroides. Others end, or 
leaue at a head, and that two maner of wayes: for some haue that head depressed, 
[/53./] 
as the bones of the middle of the hand, where they ioyne to the wrest, and of the 
insteppe, meting with the Bones of Tarsus, and Fibula, & the neither part of tibia: 
[/54./] 
certaine Processes haue their heades longe, and prominent, as the vpper head of 
[/55./] 
the thighe, where it is knit with the Bone of the hippe: Others hauyng round 
heades, as of the shoulder, and shoulder blade, likewise the bones in the middle 
[/56./] 
of the hand, ioyning to the first ioyntes of the fingers: And of such Processes as 
haue long heades, we call the slender part therof, from the body of the bone, vnto 
the head of the Processe, a necke: forasmuch as that space is like vnto the necke: 
as it shalbe playne vnto you, in beholdyng the necke and head of the vpper part 
[/57./] 
of the thighe, where it maketh entrance into the hippe. For this cause therefore 
are the heades, of the Processes made, that by touchyng with in the cauities of 
other bones adiacent, they may the better Coarticulate and ioyne together. It 
[/58./] 
is to be noted here, that as the fashion of the heades of the Processes, are diuersified 
accordyng to the places, so the hollowes that receiue them, must of necessitie 
also be diuers and different, euer answerable to their proportio~s. A deepe hole, 
[/59./] 
or cauitie therfore, you shall call after the Latins Acetabulum, after the Greekes 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] or [^GREEK OMITTED^], our English phrase offreth no proper terme for it, vnlesse 
we shall call it a caue, case, or cuppe, in respect of that, which into the hollowes 
[/60./] 
therof it admitteth. But the playne and obscure, is called [^GREEK OMITTED^], whose cauitie is 
so shallow as at first sight can scantly be discerned. Notwithstandyng there are 
certaine Circular Processes, which augme~t the profundities of such Celes as are 
[/61./] 
largely excaued, which beyng placed in the vpper part of them, are called Labra, 
or Supercilia, as it were the lippes, or browes, or as we may terme them the 
[^f.3r^] 
brinkes to those caues. These concauities are also encreased by the Gristles in 
some of them growyng, as appeareth in the caue of the Scapple bone, where it 
[/62./] 
agreeth with the shoulder, and in the Articulation of the hippe with the thighe: 
and those Processes and Cartilages are they, whiche make the more difficultie 
in Luxation. Further not onely in figure, but also in number these Processes 
[/63./] 
are diuers, and disagreeyng, some Bones beyng endewed with very fewe, and 
others agayne with many: as shall better appeare in their particular descriptions. 
But now since Nature (as we haue sayd) made nothyng in vayne, but 
all to good purpose, and (as we may say) needfully forecasted, let vs see to what 
end and purpose, were these Processes ordeined. You shall note therfore, that 
[/64./] 
not for the commodious Articulation of Bones onely, but because from them also, 
as the springs from mountaines, so the Muscles are either from them produced, 
or to them implanted: hauyng the offices also of Propugnacles, or resistant 
[/65./] 
defences. Such as are of the shoulder blades, and the Processes of the Vertebres. 
[/66./] 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] or basis are certaine corners, after the order of a firmament, or ground, 
beyond the which, and naturall vse of the member, the bone may not be suffered 
to moue: as appereth by the Cauities of the arme, that is, the Anterior corner admitting 
y=e= first Processe of the Cubitte, at what tyme it is extremely bowed: and 
the Posterior Processe of the Cubitte, that coucheth in the hinder corner, when 
Extension is made neither can any of the Processes passe further in their Celles, 
then the vtmost seat, to them by nature limited. 
 
Thus (frendly Reader) thou shalt finde it expedient, before thou enter further 
[/67./] 
among the description of Bones, exactly to learne, and to haue in mynde 
(as the Prouerbe is) at fingers end, those fewe decyffered names, which the auncient 
Anathomistes haue giuen, accordyng as it seemed best to their learned opinions: 
and that either for the fourme, situation, or properties of the partes. 
Which although we haue so farre accomplished, yet stay a while: for before I enter 
[/68./] 
fully and directly to speake of euery particular Bone in the body, you shall 
commit vnto your memory, a word or two of the maner how mans body is construed, 
and combinated, as touchyng the frame and Coarticulation of bones: as 
also of the straunge, and diffused names, wherewith their kindes of knittynges, 
in eche respect are nominated. 
 
First therfore we must consider, how vnprofitable vnto man it had bene, if 
[/69./] 
the frame of his bones had bene continuall, whole, or Solide, so consequently his 
motion, no otherwise then a brassen or stony Image: Wheras now to an infinite 
number of Artes, that need innumerable actions, man, by natures prouident 
worke in the construction of his frame, obtaineth accordingly, the passyng perfection 
of mouyng, fitte for euery one. Then so it were requisite, that the composition 
of the bones should neither be dissolute, and vnioyned nor yet altogether 
whole, and continuall: but so made, that by the fitte Coarticulation, and knitting 
together by propper ioynts, they might aswell bowe, and extend, as also remaine 
one dependyng on an other, and together supportyng. And notwithstandyng the 
needfulnes of such Insoliditie, it is otherwise as requisite, that the Bones were 
[/70./] 
not continuall, but rather by proper meanes vnited, and that is for Transpiratio~ 
sake: as in vnityng the Bones of the head by Sutures: and agayne for the diuersitie 
of the partes, as where the more hard, are committed to the more soft. 
 
Sithens then Nature (as we say) in conseruing, and compoundyng the bones 
of mans body, hath not done it after one absolute reason, or maner, which euery 
man might easily comprehend, but so diuersly, as seemeth sufficient, tedious for 
the wisest: I will let you heare the opinions of the best learned, and famous Anathomistes, 
with the meanyng of the straunge names, wherewith they haue 
entituled the diuers compositions. 
 
[^f.3v^] 
[/71./] 
First therfore vnderstand that a ioynte called of the Greekes [^GREEK OMITTED^] is a composition 
of bones that is so ordained for some kinde of motio~. Hipocrates esteemed 
simply the rou~d part of that bone, that entered into y=e= hollow of another, to be Articulus, 
& so called it. Neuertheles we giue that name, to euery naturall co~position 
[/72./] 
of bones, that is made for motion sake: whether y=e= same be euident, as possesseth y=e= 
bone of the thighe, Articulated to the hippe, and the head aboue the necke, whose 
[/73./] 
mouyng therfore is manifest: or els obscure, as haue the bones of y=e= middle of the 
ha~d, to set the bones of the wrest, and the bone of the heele, to that vnder the ancle 
called Talus: with other bones also of the like sort, whose motions are obscure, 
as shalbe more at large other where. In respect of two kyndes of motions, two 
differences also of knittynges are appoynted: the one, which no man may deny 
[/74./] 
to be euident, called Diathrosis, and the other, whose motion is hard to be discerned, 
named Synarthrosis. And both are publikly deuided agayne in tripple wise, 
that is eche of them hauyng three differences: and yet to both, but three named: 
[/75./] 
onely differe~t in their kyndes, as Enarthrosis, Arthrodia, and Gynglyman. Which 
three serue aswell vnder Diarthrosis, as Synarthrosis, recordyng that the motion 
of Diarthrosis is manifest, but Synarthrosis obscure. And this is called Enarthrosis, 
with a deepe and profou~d caue, or case, which we haue called Acetabulum, receiuyng 
[/76./] 
the long, and rou~d head of the bone that it ioyneth with all: as in the hippe, 
with the thighe, the shoulder with the Scapple bone, the middle of the hand, and 
instep, with the first bones of the fingers & toes. & c. These examples do explicate 
the maner of Enarthrosis Articulation, vnder the name of Diarthrosis. So that in 
these sortes, consist not onely manifest motion, but also all kynde of motions, and 
turnings: as Extension, Contraction, Circumaction, & such diuers sortes as we 
will separately shew hereafter. But that you may with more facilitie, gather the 
[/77./] 
sence hereof, that is to say, what Enarthrosis vnder Diarthrosis differeth fro~ Enarthrosis 
vnder Synarthrosis, for familiar exa~ple sake, I referre you to the beholdyng 
of the Articulation of Talus, with the botelike bone, and the 7. of the wrest, with 
the first and second bone of the same: which Articulation also we call Enarthrosis, 
yet not vnder the kynde of Diarthrosis, but Synarthrosis: for asmuch as the mouyng 
[/78./] 
of these bones is most obscure, and hard to be iudged, without diligent heed 
and markyng. 
 
[/79./] 
Arthrodia is a coniunctio~ of bones, wherof the one hath a head depressed, the 
other a shallow or playne cauitie, called Glene as before sayd, aunsweryng the 
the head of the other so conuectiuely, as it is hard to know the head, from the 
hollow: contrary then in Enarthrosis: wherby it commeth to passe, that the mouing 
[/80./] 
is not so euident in Arthrodia, as in Enarthosis. Notwithstandyng in the 
same Arthrodia is one mouing more euide~t then an other, although euery kynde 
of mouyng therof, is scarse euide~t: yet that, that is lesse euide~t, is to be altogether 
obscure, in co~parison of the more euident. Wherfore the more manifest motio~ in 
Arthrodia, shalbe attributed for a kynde of Diarthrosis, & the obscure action, to Synarthrosis. 
[/81./] 
Exa~ple of the mouyng of Arthrodia, vnder y=e= kynde Diarthrosis (which 
as you heare hath the more manifest motion) you may take by the coniunction 
[/82./] 
of the ribbes, with the Vertebres, & their Processes. Who are both co~stringed, & 
also dilated: as to euery sensible man, appeareth in breathyng. But Arthrodia 
you shall note somwhat more manifest, in the Articulation of y=e= first Vertebre w=t= 
[/83./] 
the seco~d, & y=e= bone Radius with Vlna. Co~trary exa~ples of a more obscure Arthrodia, 
are y=e= bones of the middle of y=e= ha~d, with those of y=e= wrest: In which also some 
mouyng, after a certaine maner is to be discryed. As if in bowyng, you wishe to 
[/84./] 
bryng the little finger & thombe together, you shal well discerne the bones in the 
middle of the ha~d, (which otherwise the ha~d being stretched forth), & straight exte~ded 
did shew a straight figure) to be Circumduced, and obliquely moued. Which 
[^f.4r^] 
is the motion proper to those bones. Much more aptly is the obscure Arthrodia 
expressed, by the three bones of Tarsus, ioyned with the shiplike bone, & the bone 
Cyboides, with the heele: and also diuers others, who although they retaine some 
kynde of mouyng, yet very difficult to be perceiued. 
 
The thyrd kynde of Articulation hath to name Gynglymos, and that is a mutuall 
[/85./] 
Congresse, or Coarticulation of the bones, whe~ as in either of the endes that 
mete, perminent partes appeare, as also cauities or little hollowes: the whiche 
cauities of the one, admitteth the Processes of the other: and the Processes of the 
same bone, coucheth within the cauities of the other: so either of them into other 
making mutuall entrance. This Articulation also hath motions, both obscure, & 
[/86./] 
manifest, the one to Diarthrosis, the other to Synarthrosis referred. That which is 
manifest, is to be looked for at the bone of the thighe, metyng with the legge, the 
cubit with the arme, and others. For the obscure kynde, regard the knittyng of 
[/87./] 
the bone Talus with the heele, and of the bones of the wrest. All which thynges 
(good Reader) if you diligently note, you shall easily cary in mynde their manner 
of knitting, with the partes of ioyntes, and differences of Articulations. 
 
And this doctrine of the ioyntes, and composition of bones, I doubt not (after 
you haue once entred into the midest therof) but you wilbe moued to thirst, in delite 
of often readyng the same, and neuer cease till such tyme, as you haue made 
it as perfect as the Pater noster: so may you, with more expedient celeritie read 
[/88./] 
ouer, the particuler description of bones. Neither ca~ I iudge it tedious, or superfluous 
to any, saue such lewde practisers, as I haue spoken of before in my Preface: 
who I would not (by my will) should euer lose their labour to looke on it, 
without grace of repentaunce grow on them. 
 
To go forward now therfore, in this our iourney or pilgrimage, it followeth 
[/89./] 
to speake of that kynde of coniunction of bones, that is called Symphysis: as whe~ 
they are so vnited together that they haue motion neither manifest, nor obscure. 
[/90./] 
Of these are three differences, thus called by proper names: Sutura, Gomphosis, 
[/91./] 
& Harmonia. In which no man, at any tyme, can discerne any motion. Although 
some heretofore, haue not bene ashamed to affirme, the bones of the head, which 
are ioyned by Sutura, to moue by proper motion: whose iudgements sure, are not 
[/92./] 
vnworthely derided, since they will needes affirme that, whiche Nature neuer 
decreed. But peraduenture they might thus deceiue them selues, by thinkyng 
the bones of the fore part of the head to moue, as oft as the same Musculous flesh 
[/93./] 
there growyng is drawne together, vpward, or downeward: & so after the same 
sort, the bones of the nose, which are ioyned by the kinde of knitting called Harmonia: 
when it is nothyng els, but the Contraction, or Dilatation of the nostrels, 
and such other partes of the nose. Let it be likewise as incredible vnto you, that 
the seames of the head can at any tyme lose, to giue scope vnto the motions of the 
[/94./] 
bones: whiche are otherwise so fixedly compact together, as without the great 
stroke and force of a chissell they cannot be deuided. Much vnlike then, to be readyly 
losed for euery motion. And this proued, it is playne, that none of the differences 
[/95./] 
of Symphysis, are endewed with any kynde of motion. 
 
But now let vs come to euery kynde by him selfe. First Sutura, whiche the 
[/96./] 
Grecians call [^GREEK OMITTED^], is a coniunction of the bones, in such sorte, as sheweth like 
vnto the shape of a seame, or a mutuall Congresse of two bones, toothed like vnto 
a sawe: which layd together, the teeth of eche, one, entreth the spaces of the other: 
[/97./] 
whereby they are mutually composed and one with in the substaunce of an 
other. Some adde an exa~ple of the Commissures like the nayles, not for that they 
mutually respect one another, but do occupy and stoppe the vacant places reside~t 
betwene the nayles of the fingers. Yet they seeme to approch nerer, to the nature 
of the thyng, which prefer the similitude of sawes, before the likenes of nayles: 
[^f.4v^] 
[/98./] 
since those are rare to be found, these very often: Of which sorte, be three in the 
head. And these seames, which in old men are hard to be found, (For scarce their 
traces may be imitated, but rather do go together after the order of appenda~ces:) 
[/99./] 
in yonger persons notwithsta~dyng are very conspicuous, and playne to be sene. 
Wherof one of the~ is in the fore part, called [^GREEK OMITTED^], an other in the hinder part, 
[/100./] 
named [^GREEK OMITTED^], the third is straight in the middest of the the top, in like sort (of 
the Grecians) called [^GREEK OMITTED^], as we should say Sagittalis, wherof in the proper 
place hereafter we will speake at large. And besides these, we must needes confesse 
[/101./] 
moe Sutures to be in the head, if so be, you will accompt the scalie Bones of 
the teples, to be fastened by seames: which to be found very like in some scalpes, 
[/102./] 
I deny not in deed: that is to say, tothed like a sawe: as we sayd euen now: yet for 
all that, it is but so in few, & those also lyeng aloft of the other: wherefore doubtlesse 
the true vnio~ of such Bones, is rather to be attributed to that kynde of Symphysis 
called Harmonia, then Sutura. For by Harmonia is vndersta~ded, that kynde 
[/103./] 
of structure in the Bones, made by a simple meetyng, that is to say, where neither 
swellyngs out, nor any cauitie, neither roughnes at all sometyme is found. 
Diuers auncient writers haue comprehended this kynde Harmonia, often vnder 
the name of Sutura: as when broken Bones ioyne mutually agayne, by Harmonia, 
[/104./] 
and Sutura: and neither way simply: but some where concurryng euen, & in 
[/105./] 
other places ronged: being therfore a mixed vnio~, participating aswel with Harmonia, 
as Sutura. Therfore not onely to beare y=e= name of one of the~. For a simple 
[/106./] 
line, and Harmonicall meting, haue the Bones of the nose, and such also is that, 
which constituteth the Palate: or to say more truly, deuideth it long wise in the 
middest. Of this sort likewise, are all the Commissures of the vpper iawe, whose 
Bones haue onely lineall distinctions. 
 
[/107./] 
The third of Symphysis differences, is called Gomphosis (albeit that Vesal. deuideth 
[/108./] 
them otherwise) and this kynde of vnitio~ is, whe~ one bone, with in another 
is infixed: as a nayle into wood, or other thyng, which beyng pulled out, y=e= place 
[/109./] 
after is left vacant and empty: euen so, the teth haue in the iawes the propper 
celles, whence they may be drawen whe~ occasion is offred. But besides the fastenyng, 
that they haue in the iawes, in dryed bodies: in creatures yet liuyng, they 
are also clothed aptly with flesh about their rootes and contract, and filled on eche 
[/110./] 
side with gowmes, which flesh is made so callous, and indurated, as that the 
teeth thereby are not a little delited, and bowlstred: and the tooth beyng drawen 
out, it closeth ouer the hole therof, so hardnyng, as that is seruiceable in stead of 
the tooth. But in dead bodies, where this flesh is dryed and consumed, or otherwise 
[/111./] 
taken away, the teth may with small labour, be pulled forth. So that it is 
most certaine, all bones, by the benefite of one thing or other, to be coupled together, 
though among them selues, diuers. And besides all these kyndes of Articulations 
rehearsed, we haue yet agayne, to affirme the coniunction of the Bones among 
them selues, to be by three kindes of meanes. For either a Cartilage goeth 
betwene, and this vnion the Grecians call Synchondrosin: as els by the helpe 
[/112./] 
of a Nerue or Ligament, they are conioyned, and that they call Synneurosis: betwene 
[/113./] 
the whiche, that is to say the Nerue, and Ligament, in deede old writers 
[/114./] 
could discerue no differences: albeit we shall call it more rightly Legament, 
which the Greekes nominate Syndesmos: therfore this knittyng, after that rate, 
[/115./] 
Syndesmosis. Either els the vnion, is made, by the apposition of fleshe, therfore 
by the Greeke name Syssarcosis. But that kynde of copulation called Synchondrosis, 
[/116./] 
is to be noted by the bones of the brest, and Pubis, the Vertebres themselues, 
[/117./] 
and partes constitutyng Os Sacrum, as also those with Os Sacrum committed: 
so are Appendances ioyned to their bones by a Cartilage. Examples of Synneurosis, 
[/118./] 
are all those bones, in which are Ligamentes to be discerned, passing forth 
[^f.5r^] 
from that part, wheras the Appendances are fastened to the bones: for with 
such Ligamentes those bones and ioyntes are clothed, and colligated. There are 
also certaine strong Ligamentes, springing after a certaine maner, in the middle 
[/119./] 
of the heades, of some bones, whereby, they are together more strongly holden: 
as playnly appeareth in the Articulation of the thighe with the hippe, and agayn 
betwene the legge and the thighe: neither other where to be found, vnlesse with 
these, you number that Ligament, wherewith, the tooth of the second Vertebre 
of the necke, is knitte to the hinder part of the head. You shall not dread, to finde 
[/120./] 
the examples of Syssarcosis very playne, in the fleshy firmifieng of the teeth in 
their Celles, by the goumes: which flesh from them remoued, they become not 
onely presently lose, but also not long enioying their places. These are the true 
[/121./] 
diuisions of the composition of Bones, which since I haue with competent breuitie 
touched, I will not any longer stand in admiration of Carolus Stephanus, 
Who either rightly knew them not, or els doubtyng, for feare of reprehension, 
gaue place vnto others: since that noble Galen (who verifieth this saying Non 
[/122./] 
omnia possumus omnes) was not a little deceiued, in ascribyng to Synarthrosis these 
differences Sutura, Gomphosis, and Harmonia, with other like poyntes, whereat 
(notwithstandyng) no man ought to grudge, is such a one as rectified the 
the whole Arte of Medicine, should in some poyntes, shew a litle imbecilitie. 
But now to our purpose: it is tyme we approche to the singular 
description of Bones: which, this well noted that we haue 
hitherto sayd, you shall in readyng, far more easilie vnderstand. 
But first, if in the reason and names of the composition 
of bones, hetherto so copiously handled, you be 
not sufficiently instructed, or fully satisfied, it 
shall not be amisse, that now and then, 
you helpe your selfe with this 
Table followyng. 
[^A table omitted.^] 
 
[^Extract 2, ff. 89r-92r^] 
 
[^f.89r^] 
[}Of the History of Man, the vij. Booke: of the 
makyng of the hart, and of the Instrumentes ministryng 
to his function: commonly called, 
 
The Vitall or Spirituall partes.}] 
 
BEfore you all whosoeuer you are (most attentiue 
Readers) I freely protest, that hetherto 
my penne hath not wauered in the doubtfull 
balaunce of ambiguitie, but passed the playne 
pathe of truth, guided by the footesteppes of 
my forerunners: till now at length, beyng 
come to a place somewhat ascendyng (as they 
that will attayne to the scope of their desire, 
must not refuse the hill with the dale) I finde 
the steppes of some willingly yeldyng to so tedious 
a iourney: others, with senses vnappalled, 
to haue plowed a path directly ouer the 
mou~taine: here I see one willingly walking a 
contrary way: and there an other, praysing their endeuours, but protestyng him 
selfe onely to haue light in the nearest way. So that here, no maruell, though 
I should stand amased, and as one plunged in the depth of contrary streames. 
 
For Galen, Vesalius & diuers others, as touchyng y=e= instrumentes that restore 
[/123./] 
the ayrie substaunce, whiche continually waste, and refreshe the innated heate, 
are contented to affirme, that, of the ayre drawen in by the lunges, part is receiued 
by the surcles and braunches of the veniall Arterie, and there hence, beyng 
prepared by the elaboration of the lunges, is by the same vessell caryed into the 
left ventricle of the hart, where, metyng with the bloud lately strayned through 
the hedge betwene the ij. ventricles, it doth together by the workyng of the hart, 
ordaine that famous composition, the vitall spirite. 
 
Contrariwise Realdus Collumbus sayth, that the bloud, sent from the right 
[/124./] 
ventricle of the hart, by the arteriall Ueyne, into the lunges, there takyng the 
mixture of ayre, is drawne, by the veniall arterie, into the left ventricle of the 
hart, whereas, beyng almost made before, it is now perfected vitall spirite. 
 
Albeit I am not ignoraunt, how lately, both these assertions are denyed: Leonardus 
[/125./] 
Botallus prouyng that bloud is brought into the left Uentricle an other 
way, that is, by a propper Ueyne that is found somewhat aboue the coronall 
Ueyne, neare adioyning to the right auricle, thence with direct tract marchyng 
to the left: which contraritie notwithstandyng (lest I should seeme to confound 
the History of the vital members:) I haue thought good to describe the partes after 
the best approued, and that in such wise, as there shall appeare therein great 
perspicuitie, and likehode of truth. Yet not that I meane to reiect Botallus, 
although he hath neither distinctly set downe the deriuation of that Ueyne, neither 
apertly the insertion therof, but because the labour of him shalbe lesse, that 
endeuoureth, alone, to stoppe the runnyng streame, accomptyng any duety 
done (right curteous Reader) in describing the partes, to haue forewarned thee of 
this late inuention. 
 
To the which description that I may briefly come, I will omit further circu~stau~ces: 
onely to do away obscuritie, I meane, that the whole be not maymed, by 
wantyng part, it behoueth to begyn at the pannicle coueryng the ribbes, & thence 
to the other partes, conteined within the capacitie of the brest. 
 
THe coate therefore or Membran to all the ribbes (beside the xij. on ech side 
[/126./] 
occupyed with the implantation of the midreif) and to the whole brest bone 
[^f.89v^] 
vnderreached, and coueryng the bodyes of the Uertebres of the brest, and the vpper 
part of the midreif, towardes the amplitude of the brest, is named in Latin 
Succingens, and commonly called Pleara, 
 
In the posteriour part it toucheth along from the first Vertebre of the brest, 
downe to the xj. out of which region, consisteth that part of the midreif, that transmitteth 
the great arterie, but in the forepart, it desceudeth from the cannell bone, 
to the lower part of the brest bone, whereto the midreif groweth. In the sides agayne, 
from the first ribbe, to the vpper face of the midreif, which respecteth the 
cauitie of the brest, thus clothyng it, and also the whole amplitude of the brest. 
 
[/127./] 
This coate, like as the cauitie of the brest, in figure varieth very much. For in 
the vpper part, accordyng to the brest, it is streit ended as it were poynted, in 
the lower part broader then aboue, but in the sides of the brest broader then in the 
inferiour part. Moreuer in the fore part it is much shorter then behynd, by reason 
of the obliquely situation of the midreif. It toucheth from the poynte of the brest 
bone, to the xi. Vertebre of the brest. Also in the fore part, and in the sides, outwardly, 
euen like to the brest it selfe, it is in figure Gibbons, or bounched forth: 
but in the posteriour part, longwise, as it were to the amplifyeng, and enlargyng 
therof, it obtaineth an inward impression, after the order of Peritonæum. For the 
bodyes of the Vertebres are apparaunt, or prominent into the cauitie of the brest, 
like as the rootes of the ribbes, which are somewhat reflected backwardes from 
the bodyes of the Vertebres, vntill, forthwith proceedyng towardes the anteriour 
partes, they are downwardes obliquate. This Membran inwardly is (for 
the most part) smooth, and as with a watry humor, ouernoynted. Besides, where 
it reacheth forth certaine Membranous Processes, by which it either yeldeth out 
other Membrans, or gathereth some peculiar body vnto it. 
 
Sometyme there is found, although very seldome, a harder kinde of fat in the 
[/128./] 
inside of this coate, no otherwise then to Peritonæum, and that especially, where 
it is nearer to the Vertebres, and where the chiefest veynes therof are guided. 
 
[/129./] 
Moreouer here, and there, on both sides, it putteth forth Membranous Fibres 
to the lunges, whereby the lunges are thereto very fast knit. And to the inuolucre 
of the hart, where the same coate couereth the midreif, in great scope, is continuated, 
& tyed. But the outside of this Membran, which groweth euery where 
to the partes adiacent, is rough, and vnequall, after the maner of Membrans connected, 
and tyed together. 
 
[/130./] 
It is perforated as oft as the midreif, since it couereth it, that is to say, twise, 
not three tymes, as Vesalius would: once for the descense of the stomach or vpper 
[/131./] 
Orifice of the Uentricle, and the second tyme for the ascense of Vena caua: but in 
deede the great Arterie, runnyng close by the body of the Vertebres, cannot perforate 
the same, but is rather crossed ouer therewith, or to be playne, the midreif 
[/132./] 
rather seemeth to giue backe to the side thereof. Under the Cannell bone, it is 
not pearsed with a large and continuall hole, but the vessels which creepe vnto it 
thether, it containeth with very many holes, and groweth vnto them. Here likewise 
it transmitteth the braunches of Uena caua, and Arteria magna, as also the 
stomach, rough Arterie, the Nerues of the vj. payre of sinewes of the brayne, and 
the Nerues to the midreif. Last of all, in the hinder part, it is perforated, after 
the longitude therof, and that on both sides, with an orderly consert of Ueynes, 
and Arteries, entryng forth, that way, to the spaces of the ribbes. 
 
[/133./] 
This coate is in substaunce Membranous, to wit, hard, thinne, equall, and 
somewhat, in strength, surmountyng Peritonæum. And like as Peritonæum, so 
also the substau~ce of this Membran, is, at the backe, harder, then neare the brest. 
[/134./] 
For the begynning therof, is taken from the Ligamentes, which bynde together, 
the bodyes of the Vertebres: vpon those, I say, it chiefly doth depend. But it is 
[^f.90r^] 
not simple, although Uesalius espyed not the contrary, but double: In meane not 
[/135./] 
the right side, and the left, but that euery where this Membran Pleura, is two 
fold, or double, or simply two Membrans, the one interne, the other externe, betwene 
which Ueynes, Arteries, and Nerues do slyde: all which are caryed betwene 
[/136./] 
the spaces of the ribbes. Whence it happeneth, that, there, many tymes, 
springeth inflamation, with much tension, and prickyng dolour, called the Pleurisie. 
Collumbus indgeth the cause of this duplication the deepe dexteritie of Nature, 
that so, the outer might defend the inner Membran (then which nothyng is 
more sensible) from the rigour of the ribbes, which should haue bene profered, alway, 
through the perpetuall motion of the lunges. 
 
Beside this succingent coate, the ribbes haue to them, one peculiar, which is 
[/137./] 
no other, then the Membran commo~ almost to all bones, called (in that it couereth 
the bone) of the Greekes Periosteo~. But Pleura, in that it bewrappeth what 
[/138./] 
soeuer is conteined within the concauitie of the brest, doth, like Peritonæum, 
lend coates to all the partes conteined, firmely thereby knittyng euery organ to 
other. Last of all, it so propperly prepareth way to the Nerues of Septum transuersum, 
as that it deduceth them, hid as it were in a scaberth, to it. This, for the 
[/139./] 
vse therof, in that it clotheth, defendeth, and strengthneth the inner partes, is called 
a coate: but as touchyng the substaunce, a Membran. 
 
This Membran, or rather these Membrans, creepeth downeward after the 
[/140./] 
sides of Sternon, towardes the Spine, the right among the~ selues beyng distaunt 
from the left: and beyng so fastened to the same spine, do deuide the brest into ij. 
[/141./] 
cauities, and the lunges into two partes: neither that rashly, but that, one side 
beyng hurt, the other (notwithstandyng) might escape free, and serue to natures 
vse, & retaine at the least halfe their action. This reduplicatio~ (as we may call it) 
[/142./] 
of Pleura, is in this place, called Mediastinum, because it midmeasureth the brest, 
beyng led from the toppe of the brest, to the bottome, or lowest part. Betwene 
[/143./] 
Mediastinum, that is, this double Pleura, deuidyng the brest into two, some 
matter may be gathered, which, Sternon beyng perforated, may be drawne out, 
by a diligent Chirurgian, and in Anathomicall practise expert. 
 
WIthin the vpper part of the brest, where the veynes and arteries are deuided, 
appeareth a certaine Glandulous part, called Thimus, which in Calues, 
[/144./] 
and such others creatures, is most pleasaunt to be eaten. I suppose we call 
it the sweete bread. 
 
About the middest of Æesophagus, are two litle Glandules, placed there of nature 
[/145./] 
to humect, and moysten that passage. 
 
THere is a certaine coate, common to the inside of the nostrels, to the palate, 
[/146./] 
and to the toung, and it seemeth to be a portion of Dura mater, of the hard 
Membran of the brayne, which, after it is crept forth of the Scull, is amplified, 
made thicker, and almost fleshy: wherewith when as the whole palate within, 
and the mouth is clothed, as the furthest part, or exremitie of the palate, it becommeth 
double, and somewhat lengthned, constituteth a round, long, and litle 
thicke pendule, called by diuers names: as Vna, Vuula, Columella, Gargareon. 
 
The office of it is to deteyne the humiditie fallyng from the brayne, neither 
[/147./] 
that in vayne, but beyng there holden, to moysten those partes, whose motions 
are perpetuall. 
 
Neither doth it meanly auayle to the vtterauuce of voyce, and pronounciatio~, 
[/148./] 
as apparauntly we are taught, by the example of such, as long haue laboured in 
the Spanish dissease, to the vtter ruine and vastation of this part: how afterward 
(I say) they speake rather after the maner of crowes, then men. 
 
A thyrd vtilitie also hath this same Gargarion, and that is, lest the dust, which 
[/149./] 
sometyme meeteth vs at vnwares, our mouthes beyng open, should infeste and 
[^f.90v^] 
trouble the rough arterie, whiche this rather incercepteth by the way. Ueynes, 
[/150./] 
into the middest therof, it receiueth from those brau~ches; sent to the coate of the 
palate, but, with Nerues, both participate litle. It is euident also, that, to what 
[/151./] 
persons this Gargareon is wantyng, to such, the cold ayre is much more greuous 
then to other men as testifieth Gal. Lib. 11. de vs. partium. 
 
ON both sides of the iawes are two Glandules: one on the right side of Gargareon, 
[/152./] 
and the other on the left: and they haue to name Paristhmiæ: tonsillæ, 
[/153./] 
amigdala, fauces: these also (beyng of Glandulous substaunce) were made to 
the receiuyng of the humiditie of the brayne, & therfore were they placed thus in 
[/154./] 
the iawes (called of the Grecians Pharynx, of the Latins Fauces) to minister vnto 
them moysture. But the iawe is conteined within these borders, the foundation 
of the head, and palate, the anteriour bodyes of the Vertebres of the necke, in 
which place, sundry, and many organs appeare: as the toppe of Trachea Arteria 
called Larinx, the bone called Hyoides, and his Muscles, the roote of the tou~g & his 
Muscles, the vj. payre of sinewes, y=e= inner veynes called Ingulares, the arteries Carootides, Gargareon, the neither iawe, and portion of his Muscles, the Processes 
Styloides, and the stomach or Æsophagus. Therfore these same Glandules, beyng 
vsed in so strete a place, are, from the elders, called Paristhimiæ. 
 
[/155./] 
Enwrapped they are in the same Membran, wherewith we haue sayd the 
mouth and palate to be clothed; which, further descendyng, runneth to Æsophagus, 
constitutyng his interiour coate: as also the inner clothyng of the Uentricle, 
and intrels: and yet more downward, behind the toung, inuesteth the Epiglotte, 
Larinx, and the rough arterie, euen to the extreme partes of his brau~ches dispersed 
throughout the lunges. But the outside of this rough arterie is shrouded vnder 
the succingent Membra~, called Pleura. And thus much, beyng exactly wayed, 
is sufficient for these partes. 
 
[/156./] 
THe lunges are sited in the brest, wherof the greater part they occupy, beyng 
bound to the bodyes of Vertebres, to the hart, and to the rough arterie: into 
[/157./] 
two partes this agayne is deuided, a right and a left: wherefore some infer that 
there be two lunges. The figure of it outwardly is round, inwardly hollow: & 
[/158./] 
that necessarily, since so it behoued it to yeld vnto the hart, and Pericardion. But 
besides that diuision, this instrument, the lunges is deuided (to the end it might 
[/159./] 
both be more agile, and easie to moue, as also, more aptly to embrace the hart) into 
foure lobes, not into fiue, as in beastes Galen approued. Which diuersitie is 
[/160./] 
thought to happe~, because in them the liuer is much distaunt fro~ the hart. Wherfore 
[/161./] 
when the hollow Ueyne, so long way from the Vertebres, is distaunced, it 
required a boulster, wherewith to be vnderlayd: so that prudent Nature then 
willed, that the lunges, in beastes, should by one lobe, surmount the same instrument 
in the body of ma~: which lobe, in those creatures, is strewed vnder the hollow 
Ueyne: but it is hollow, as Galen most excellently hath sayd, because it giueth 
place to the roundnes of the hollow veyne. But since that in man, betwene 
the hart, and liuer, onely the midreif lyeth, there was no neede at all of the v. lobe. 
 
[/162./] 
The substaunce of the lunges is rare, light, and porie, as a sponge, in colour 
[/163./] 
somewhat red, which kynde of substaunce the elders haue named Parenchyma. i. 
Assusio. It is inuolued of the Membran pleura, lately described, beyng there very 
[/164./] 
porie. Through this instrument, the lunges, these vessels are disseminated: to 
wit, the rough arterie, the veniall arterie and the arteriall Ueyne. 
 
The rough arterie is caried in through the longitude of the necke, in the fore 
[/165./] 
part vnder Larinx, consisting of gristelly ringes, but not perfect ringes (as in the 
[/166./] 
History of Cartilages appeareth, where the rough arterie is at large described) 
which deuidyng into a right & left first, and those, by litle and litle, into many others, 
is wasted, in braunches, to the extreme partes of the lunges. The office & 
[^f.91r^] 
seruice which it oweth to nature, is to carie ayre, both in, and out: and from the 
vpper partes proceedyng, goeth downe to the lower. 
 
The veniall arterie, from beneath, is caryed almost straight vpward, beying 
[/167./] 
first also deuided into a right, and left part, then diuers wayes ramisted, and approchyng 
to the braunches of the rough arterie. 
 
The same likewise doth the artoriall veyne. Thus these three vessels are embraced 
[/168./] 
of a substaunce rare, light, and porie, thus beyng the lunges engedred. 
 
Whose vse is, as the Anathomistes rightly write, for the coolyng, and refrigeration 
[/169./] 
of the hart: this effect beyng wrought, by the bringyng of cold ayre vnto 
it. And who likewise knoweth not, that the same both serueth to inspiration, expiration, 
and voyce. 
 
All which offices, of right appertainyng to the lunges, I ca~ proue by the testimony 
[/170./] 
of euery Anathomist: since herein, as with one concent, they accord & ioyne 
together: but seuerally Collumbus addeth one great effect, and nothyng touched 
heretofore of any other. For it is (sayth he) the preparation, yea almost the generatio~ 
of vitall spirites, which after are perfected in the hart. That is to say, the inspired 
ayre it receiueth, though the mouth, & nostretes, it beyng brought, by the 
[/171./] 
conueiance of the rough arterie through the substau~ce of the lunges: the which instrume~t 
ceasseth not to mixe the same ayre, with that bloud, which is brought vnto 
it, by the arteriall veyne, from the right ventricle of the hart. For this same arteriall 
[/172./] 
veyne, besides that it bringeth bloud, for nourishment, is so large, as that it 
may serue for other vse also. And this bloud by styrring, through the continuall 
mouyng of the lunges, is made thinne, and together with the ayre mixed, which 
thus, by the same refraction, and beatyng together, is prepared: so that, the ayre, & 
bloud, together mixed, are receiued by the braunches of the veniall Arterie, & at 
lenght, by the trunke of the same veyne, sent into the left ventricle of the hart: 
[/173./] 
but so wel mixed, and attenuated together, as that to the hart, small labour at all 
is left: after which small elaboratio~, the hart (as it were) laying to the last ha~d, to 
the makyng of the vitall spirites, that, by meanes of the great arterie, they might 
be distributed to all the partes of the body it was most requisite. 
 
The which new assertion, or late inuention of Collumbus, because it was like 
to be much spurned at, and by all meanes possible (especially of those that had 
sworne them selues to the decrees of Galen, and Vesalius) confuted, and reiected: 
[/174./] 
the same Authour hath (as it were) entreated vs willyngly to contemplate, first, 
the magnitude and largenes of the lunges, which without vitall bloud could not 
endure, when as there is not the least particle in all the body that is destitute 
therof. But if this vitall bloud be not begotten in the lunges: from what part 
might it thether haue bene sent, but from the great arterie: and thence (sayth he) 
not one braunch, great, nor litle, is conuayed to the lunges. For to this purpose, 
as touching the veniall arterie, or arteriall veyne, he demaundeth how, by them, 
vitall bloud should be brought vnto the lu~ges, whilest nether of them doth beate: 
but serue for other speciall offices, as shortly more largely shall appeare. 
 
There are litle small Nerues, which touch onely the coate of the lunges, but 
[/175./] 
pearse not within: which maketh that the lunges are with very small sense endewed: 
notwithstandyng that it is a member greatly needefull, and so necessary. 
The coate wherof, since it is porie, no maruel that in time of y=e= Pleurisie, & inflamation 
of the lunges, it receiue bloud into it, which spettle outwardly declareth. 
 
To conclude, the lunges, so needefull to the refreshyng of the hart, nature did 
[/176./] 
not onely deuise, as also, lest it should be serued at any tyme with vnprepared 
ayre; but many creatures she would haue breth, for the cause of voyce also, so requisite 
[/177./] 
to their life and naturall beyng. That therfore, which is giuen out from 
[/178./] 
the lunges in the tyme of expiration, is the exellent & notable matter of voyce. 
 
[^f.91v^] 
THe Membran enuoluyng the whole hart, with his auricles, & begynnynges 
[/179./] 
of the vessels, like a certaine casket, or case thereto, is called of the Greekes 
Pericardion, in Latin Cordis inuolucrum: some Casula cordis, for that it is as a 
certaine house vnto the hart: the barbarous number, by the addition of one letter 
pronounce it Capsula. But we will vse here to say the inuolucre of the hart. 
 
[/180./] 
The image, or portraiture wherof is very like vnto y=e= fourine of a Pine nut, 
hauyng a round orbiculer foundation, and a blunt poynt. 
 
[/181./] 
But the foundation of the hart is not continuall with the inuolucre therof, 
but at least pearsed through with v. holes, whereof two yeld way to the hollow 
Ueyne. That is to say, one, where the same doth perforate the midreif. But the 
second hole is that, where the same Ueyne, rising vpwardes from the foundation 
of the hart, goeth to the Cannell bone. The thyrd letteth in the veniall arterie. 
The fourth is prepared for the great arterie. And the fift yeldeth way to the arteriall 
Ueyne. To the partes of these vessels, distaunt a notable space from the vpper 
face of the hart, this inuolucre groweth, after a sort fetchyng his begynnyng 
from them. The rest of y=e= inuolucre, transmittyng no vessell, is whole, and co~tinuall, 
and euery where alike, saue that from the foundation downwardes (as is 
sayd) it strecheth into a blunt poynt, after the fashion of the hart. 
 
[/182./] 
The foundation, or seate, is meant to be the toppe, and highest part therof, 
which in man, is placed somewhat higher then the body of the fift Vertebre of 
the brest, yet lyeng not close thereto, but ouer agaynst it. 
 
[/183./] 
Besides, this inuolucre, in the progresse or desce~se therof, varieth as touchyng 
situatio~. For in ma~, whose fore part of the brest nature hath made shorter, is seated 
so crooked, towardes the left side, & agayne forwardes, as that the poynt after 
a certaine maner reacheth more downward, the~ that part of y=e= brest bone, whereto 
the vpper part of Septu~ tra~suersum groweth. And againe so much appertaineth 
to the left side, as that the right part of his poynt scarse attaineth to the middest of 
the brest. Also to the fore partes the poynt so proceedeth, as that it may touch the 
left side of the brest bone, and Cartilages coarticulated or knit thereto. 
 
[/184./] 
It consisteth of Membranous substaunce, and with the other Membrans therfore 
numbred amo~gest the similar partes of the body. For it is enterwouen with 
no Fibres, but is a simple Membran, euery where thicke, very hard, and constitutyng 
a concauitie, wherein the hart may both vse his dilatation, and constriction 
easely. For the hart, in it selfe, containeth no portion growyng thereto, 
[/185./] 
but is distaunt euery where equally from it. 
 
This cauitie is altogether smooth, wette with a certaine thinne humor, and 
[/186./] 
destitute of all fatnes. And so is the outer face of this inuolucre, although Aristotle 
[/187./] 
farre otherwise supposed, affirmyng the inuolucre of the hart to be fat, deluded 
peraduenture with the intersepient Membrans, which, growyng to this inuolucre, 
are very fat, especially in man. But the exteriour face of this inuolucre, 
for y=e= Fibrous knittyngs, as Me~brans growing together, is rough. To the anteriour 
part of the inuolucre of the hart, whereto those Membrans are not knit, Me~branous 
Fibres, fulfillyng, or supplyeng the roome of these Membrans, do grow. 
But to the whole posteriour part, the intersepient Membra~s are freely growyng. 
 
[/188./] 
All the poynt, and egregious portion of the right side of this inuolucre, groweth 
very strongly, and in most ample space, to the sinewy circle of Septum transuersum: 
whiche thyng in deede is peculiar to man, since in Dogges, Apes, and 
Swine it is much distaunt from the midreif. Also, in man onely, the anteriour 
part of the poynt cleaueth to Pleura, with Fibrous knittynges, in that part (I 
meane on the left side) where the Gartilages of the vj. and vij. ribbes are bound 
vnto the brest. But that knittyng of the inuolucre is brought to passe among the 
Membrans that deuide the brest in the middest for no where the inuolucre of the 
[^f.92r^] 
hart exceedeth the middest of them, nether in any part toucheth the lunges, but 
by their interuenture.
