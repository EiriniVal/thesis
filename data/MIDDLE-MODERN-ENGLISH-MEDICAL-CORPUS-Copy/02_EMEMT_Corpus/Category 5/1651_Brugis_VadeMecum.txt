NExt I shall shew you how to use every severall 
instrument before mentioned, together 
with the composition of all these rehearsed medicines, 
[^p.7^] 
with the natures, qualities, and operations 
of every one of them, according to the most 
approved Authours, and the best moderne practise. 
 
[}Certaine instructions concerning the use of 
such instruments as I have mentioned 
in this Booke.}] 
 
[}And first of the Incision knife.}] 
 
THe use of this instrument is to cut the skin, 
or flesh upon needfull occasions, in paring 
away the putrid part of a gangrenous member, 
after dismembring in making fontanella's, or issues, 
in opening apostemes, in scarifications, in using the 
cuppinglasse, & c. 
 
Let this Instrument bee alwayes kept cleane 
and bright, by being rubbed dry after it hath been 
used, and sharp as any rasour. Let the Artist ever 
hide it from the Patients sight with a cloath, and 
also all other sharp Insruments, for divers reasons. 
 
[}Of the ordinary Sizzers.}] 
 
THe Sizzers be very usefull to cut cloath for 
Roulers, Lint, and Emplaisters, to cut, and 
clip off proud flesh, loose skin, putrid flesh, or 
ends of sinnews. 
 
[^p.8^] 
[}Of the Spatula.}] 
 
THe Spatula is used to spread Emplaisters, to 
mingle your Unguents on your palme of your 
hand, to cover your Pledgets, also to mingle and 
stirre Unguents and Emplaisters in the composition; 
and of these I wish the Artist to have divers 
sorts of severall sizes, of Iron and of wood kept 
very cleane and handsome. 
 
[}Of the small Probes.}] 
 
THe Probe cannot be missing in the Chyrurgeons 
Plaister-box, for without it can nothing 
be done artificially. The use of it is to arme the 
eye with soft lints, and with the other end to 
sound, or make probation of the depth of a wound: 
sometime the small end armed with lint, is dipped 
in some Oyle, or liquor, and conveyed into the 
bottome of an Ulcer, or Fistula, thereby to mundifie, 
corrode, or heale the griefe, according as occasion 
shall offer it selfe. 
 
[}Of the Uvula Spoone.}] 
 
THis Instrument serveth to put pepper, Salt, 
and fine Bole in, and putting it under the Uvula, 
or pallate of the mouth, being fallen, and 
blowing the powder into the cavity behinde it 
throw the hollow pipe: It also serveth to warme 
a medicine in, as Unguents, to dip in Tents when 
[^p.9^] 
you want an ordinary spoone, also to powre scalding 
Oyle, or liquor into a wound, whereto I do 
constantly use it in green wounds as hereafter you 
shall find in the ensuing discourse of curing of 
wounds. 
 
[}Of the Levatory.}] 
 
THe Levatory is a necessary Instrument to elevate 
a depressed Cranium, or Skull, but the 
Artist shall in no wise be over curious, or hasty in 
the using it; for if he see no evill symptomes appeare 
he may expect natures worke, by which he 
shall perceive the skull depressed to rise and scale 
admirably. It may also serve many times to take 
off a scale of a bone after amputation of the fingers, 
or toes. 
 
[}Of the stiching Quill and Needles.}] 
 
THese are instruments that cannot be missed in 
your Plaister-box; you shall therefore have in 
your stitching Quill at least three needles of severall 
sizes or bignesse, with square points, well set, 
and ready armed with green, or red silk oyled, your 
needles alwayes kept oiled, and cleane from rust, in 
want of silk at any time upon necessity you may use 
thread, rubbing it with some kinde of emplaister: 
You must also have in your said stiching Quill a 
Taylors needle or two with thread to sow your 
rollers, & make them fast in the rolling of wounds, 
fractures, or dislocations. 
 
[^p.10^] 
[}Of the Director.}] 
 
THe Director is an Instrument to guide and direct 
the Incision knife, in dilation or inlarging 
a wound, when you are neare any vessels. They 
are also used in cutting for the stone. 
 
[}Of the Forceps.}] 
 
THese are used to take off Emplaisters, Pledgets, 
and Tents, to take out a spill of a bone, to 
hold up any peice of superfluous flesh or skin, 
thereby, the better to cut it with the sizzers, 
or incision knife, to take out any thing 
that may chance into the eare, nostrils, mouth, or 
throat, to take out a bullet lying within reach, or 
any thing that is offensive in a wound, and is an 
Instument or continuall, and very necessary use in 
Chyrurgery. 
 
[}Spatula Linguæ.}] 
 
THe Spatula linguæ, or speculu~ linguæ is much like 
an ordinary spatula at one end, only it is perforated 
and cut through, the better to hold the tongue 
downe without slipping off; the other end is made 
to scrape the tongue that is furred in Feavers, Cankers, 
or other affects of the mouth, it is used to 
hold downe the tongue when you inject any liquor 
into the throat, or apply any medicine to the 
mouth or throat, or when you would make inspection 
[^p.11^] 
into the mouth or throat in any affects 
of the Uvula, or in Quinces, Cancers, or excoriations 
of the mouth or gums. 
 
[}The Flegme}] 
 
IS an Instrument used to open the gums, and separate 
them from the tooth you intend to pull 
out, compassing the tooth with the round sharpe 
end thereof close to the tooth, piercing deeper by 
little and little, untill you feele it as low as the jaw 
bone: Some use to open a veine with this instrument, 
but for mine owne part, I do disalow it as 
very uncertaine, and dangerous for touching the 
Nerves, or greater vessels. 
 
[}Next we must look into the Salvatory to see what 
Unguents we have there, to declare the 
Composition of them, their 
Vertues and Uses.}] 
 
[}And first of Basilicon.}] 
 
BAsilicon is an Unguent used almost in all kinds 
of wounds, ulcers & apostumes, either per se or 
mixed with other ungue~ts, for it hath the vertue to 
heat, humect, and mitigate pain: it digesteth & incarnateth 
wouds and ulcers, and suppurateth apostumes, 
either hot or cold, being somewhat thick 
[^p.12^] 
spread upon cloath or leather, and it mitigateht the 
paine thereof. It is likewise very fitly used with 
Præcipitate, Ægyptiacum, or any corroding medicine, 
making them work with more ease, and better 
mundifies: it is also good for burnings and 
scaldings; and is thus made. 
 
+R Ceræ flavæ. 
Resinæ pinguis. 
Picis græcæ, of each half a pound. 
Olei, two pounds four ounces. 
 
Melt the Rosin, and the Pitch, in the Oyle, then 
adde the Wax and boyle them to a just consistence. 
 
[}Liniment of Arcæus.}] 
 
THis Arcæus Liniment is a soveraigne balme, 
not to be sufficiently commended in all wounds, 
whatsoever, especially in those of the head, where 
it doth, meerly of it selfe, all the intentions of 
healing, the Flux of bloud being first stayed; for 
it digesteth, mundifieth, incarnateth, and cicatrizeth, 
it defendeth from accidents, and is very avodine: 
I have divers times applyed it mixed with 
other unguents to painfull ulcers, and fistula's with 
good successe: it is made as followeth. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
+R. Gummi elemni. 
Teribinthinæ abietinæ. 
	Of each 1. ounce and halfe. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
Sevi veruecini antiqui & liquefacti, 2 ounces. 
Pinguedinis Porcinæ antiquæ, & liquefactæ, 
one ounce. 
 
[^p.13^] 
Dissolve the Gum in Sack, and evaporate the Sack, 
then put in the fats, and lastly the terebinte, and 
mingle them well together. 
 
[}The golden Oyntment.}] 
 
THis unguent is used to incarne wounds and ulcers, 
being first mundified, and it is a most precious 
balme to heale them; it is a good healer of 
burnings and scaldings, the fire first taken out; the 
composition is as followeth. 
 
+R. Ceræ flavæ, one pound. 
Olei, two pound and halfe. 
Terebinthinæ, two ounces. 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Resinæ pineæ 
Colophoniæ 
	Of each one ounce and halfe. 
Thuris 
Mastices 
	Of each one ounce. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
Croci, one dramme. 
 
Dissolve the Mastick in Sack, then put in the Oyle, 
Rosin, Colophony, and Frankinsence, and when 
they are well melted scrape in the Wax, melt that, 
and then adde the Turpentine, and lastly the Saffron 
when you take it off. 
 
[}Unguent Apostolorum.}] 
 
VVEE commonly use this Unguent to cleanse 
and scoure foule Ulcers and Fistula's, and 
to make a good ground for healing; it abateth 
spongeous flesh, and is of temperature hot and 
[^p.14^] 
dry; and is made as followeth. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
+R. Terebinthinæ 
Resinæ 
Ceræ albæ 
Ammoniaci 
	Of each fourteen drams. 
Rad. Aristolochiæ longæ 
Thuris masculi 
Bdellii 
	Of each six drammes. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
Myrrhæ, Galbani Of each halfe an ounce. 
Oppoponax, Floris æris Of each two drammes. 
Lithargyri Nine drammes. 
Olei, If it be Summer, two pounds, 
If Winter, three pounds. 
Aceti, as much as will suffice to dissolve the Ammoniacum, 
Galbanum and Oppoponax. 
 
Make the Oyntment according to Art. 
 
[}Lukatullies Balsome.}] 
 
IT is good for burnes, inflammations, fresh 
wounds, ulcers, fistulaes, being powred in scalding 
hot; for so I use it to incarne fresh wounds. In 
bruises, ulcers of the reines, stone in kidneyes, or 
bladder, with difficulty of making water, I use to 
give one drachme in Sacke for bruises, in white 
wine for the stone: it is made as followeth. 
 
Olei, one pound and halfe. 
Vini Hispanici, one pound. 
 
Boyle them to the consumption of halfe the 
Sack, then scrape in 
 
[^p.15^] 
Ceræ albæ, three ounces. 
 
Boyle them untill all the wine bee consumed: 
take it from the fire and put in 
 
Terebintinæ, 
Venetæ puræ, washed in Rose water six ounces. 
 
Boyle them a little, then take them from the fire, 
& sprinkle in half an ounce of red sanders in powder, 
and stir it untill it be cold, left the Sanders lye 
in the bottome. 
 
[}Unguent Diapompholigos.}] 
 
IS good to heale painfull ulcers in any part of the 
body, especially of the yard, or betwixt glans 
and preputium, as also any fretting, or painfull ulcers 
of the legges, or elsewhere. It is very much 
used before all other unguents in ulcers of the yard, 
and against all violent, painfull, and corrosive ulcers, 
there is scarce a better knowne. In Noli me 
tangere in the face, it hath beene well experienced, 
and is very usefull in divers occasions: it is made 
as followeth: 
 
Olei Rosati, sixteen ounces. 
Succi Solavi, six ounces. 
 
Boyle them untill the juice be consumed: then 
adde 
 
Ceræ alba, five ounces. 
Cerussæ lotæ, two ounces. 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Plumbi usti & loti 
Pompholigos præ. 
Thuris puri 
	One ounce. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
 
[^p.16^] 
Make them into the forme of an Unguent according 
to Art. 
 
[}Unguent Nutritum, or Triapharmacum.}] 
 
THis Unguent is used in curing Erisipula's, excoriations, 
or bladderings of the skin, and such as 
are called the shingles It is good to take out the 
fire in burnings and scaldings, and it hindreth the 
falling downe of any moyst humour to any ulcer 
in any part of the body, being spread upon cap 
paper thin, and layd over the whole distempered 
part; also against any slight scabbiness or itching 
humour whencesoever it is. It is an especiall good 
defensative against any scalding, or vicious humour 
flowing to any ulcer; I do often mix it with other 
unguents in curing ulcers, the composition is as 
followeth. 
 
Lithargyri auri, searced very fine, halfe a pound. 
Olei Rosati one pound 
Aceti foure ounces. 
 
Put the Litharge into a morter, powre into it now 
a littel Oyle, then a little Vinegar, working them 
up and downe very well, untill the Litharge hath 
drunk up all the liquor, and come to the consistence 
of an Oyntment, and white. 
 
[}Desiccativum rubrum}] 
 
IS used to dry up and siccatrize ulcers, that by 
reason of their moisture are hard to siccatrize; 
[^p.17^] [^Original misnumbered as p.33.^] 
it is used spread on Lint, either by it selfe, or mixed 
with a little Diapompholigos: it us thus made. 
 
+R Olei Rosati omphacini, one pound and halfe. 
Ceræ albæ, five ounces. 
 
Melt them together, and put them into a leaden 
mortar, and sprinkle into them: 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Terræ l_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]mniæ, or boli armeni 
Lapidis calaminaris, finely beaten 
	of each foure ounces. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
Litargyri auri, 
Cerussæ, of each three ounces. 
Camphoræ, one dramme. 
 
Worke them all very well together in the mortar 
to the forme of an Unguent. 
 
These are for the Salvatory; next I shall shew 
you the making of the Emplaisters, and then take 
the rest in order. 
 
[}Emplaisters.}] 
 
[}And first of Sticticum Paracelsi.}] 
 
IT is an admirable Emplaister for the curing 
wounds and stabbes, and also in the cure of all 
dangerous wounds whatsoever: it hath the precedence 
aswell for contused wounds, as incised; for 
it asswageth paine, defendeth from accidents, discusseth, 
mollifieth, attracteth, incarneth, digesteth, 
consolidates, and is good for any old ache, proceeding 
of a cold cause; it is especiall good for ulcers 
[^p.18^] 
on the legges, or elsewhere, in any part of the body. 
It is very excellent in wounds of the head: it 
separateth the foule from the good flesh, as I have 
experienced in members amputated in the putride 
part, and hinders the growth of that which is 
naught. 
 
It is a sure remedy for cut nerves, or bruised. 
 
It drawes out iron, wood or lead from wounds 
being only layd upon them. 
 
It cures the biting and sting of venemous beasts, 
and drawes out the poyson. 
 
It maturates apostumes of any sort, being layd 
upon them. 
 
It is an especiall remedy against cancers, fistulaes, 
scrophula, Ignem Persicum. 
 
It easeth all paines of wounds or strokes. 
 
It is good for ruptures. 
 
Where the head is inflated shave away the hairs, 
and lay on this Emplaister and it cures it. 
 
It easeth the paines of the backe being applied. 
 
It will last in full force at least fifty yeeres: the 
composition which I use is thus made: 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
+R Minii 
Lapidis calaminaris 
	of each halfe a pound. 
Lithagyri auri 
& argenti 
	of each three ounces. 
[^End of a list figure.^]

Olei laurini, halfe a pound.

	of each one ounce. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
Florum Antimonii two drammes. 
Croci Martis as much. 
Camphuræ one ounce. 
 
[}The maner of preparing it is thus.}] 
 
THE five gummes must be steeped in Vineger, 
melted, and the Vineger evaporated, 
and the gummes strayned through a 
pretty thicke canvas, then boyled againe, 
and againe strayned; and because of the dregges 
[^p.20^] [^Original misnumbered as p.36.^] 
which will be strayned out, therfore must the dose 
of your gummes bee increased: being thus used, 
let them bee put into a cleane pan, upon a gentle 
fire, untill they be thicke. 
 
Put your Linseed oyle and Sallet oyle into another 
panne and put to them the litarge of gold and 
silver, and let them boyle ever stirring them, untill 
the oyle be coloured, then put in the Calaminaris 
in powder, and a little after adde the red lead working 
them together for almost two houres, and untill 
they be almost boyled enough, which you may 
prove by putting a drop upon your nayle, and if it 
congeale and _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]un not abroad, then it is enough. 
 
Then adde the vernish, oyle of bayes, waxe, and 
colophony, and when they be all well mixed, and 
melted, then warme your pan with the gummes, 
and presently poure into it all that is in the second 
pan, stirring it very fast, that it may incorporate 
as it runnes into the gummes, and let your panne 
stand all this while on warme coales, but beware 
of boyling, for then your gummes will goe one 
way, and your oyles another; afterwards put in 
the pouders by degrees, still stirring it for about an 
houre. Lastly, adde your Camphyre dissolved in 
oyle of Juniper; if it be too hard, then put in a 
little more waxe and Colophony. 
 
You shall know when it is boyled enough, by 
putting a sticke with some drops of the Emplaister 
on it into cold water; if it be soft and sticke to 
[^p.21^] [^Original misnumbered as p.37.^] 
thy fingers, then it must be boyled longer, untill it 
wax harder. Then take it from the fire, and poure 
it into a great vessell full of fayre water, and work 
it out with your hands anointed with the oyles of 
camomile, roses, juniper, earthwormes, Hipericon, 
of each a like quantity mingled together, work 
it thus about three or foure houres, and make it up 
in rowles, and keep them in soft leather. 
 
In the composition of this Emplaister, you shall 
according to Paracelsus, observe three intentions: 
viz. 
 
1 The healing by reason of the waxe and Colophony. 
 
2 The taking away of accidents, which is by 
gummes: viz. Oppoponax, Galibanum, Sagapenum, 
Bdellium, Ammoniacum. 
 
3 The putrifaction (for there is no w_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
without accidents, but is subject to putrifaction, 
as wormes, and evill flesh growing up) which is 
taken away, and hindred by those things which 
doe so greatly consolidate, as the mastick,myrhhe, 
and the like. 
 
4 That the part be preserved from flesh, scabs, 
dry scales, cramp, convulsion, _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]per, and the like 
accidents, which is done through the strength of 
the mineralls, to wit the Litharge, [^ORIG. BLURRED^]Antimony, 
Cerusse, [^ORIG. BLURRED^] C_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]is, and the 
like. And so much concerning [^ORIG. BLURRED^] Paracelsi. 
 
[^p.22^] 
[}Diacalciteos or Diapalma,}] 
 
IS an Emplaister that mitigateth paine, and is 
a good defensative against all venemous humours, 
and is used last in wounds, and ulcers, 
to induce a cicatrice, which it is very good for; 
also it hath a very good quality to asswage the pain 
in the small of the back, proceeding from distempered 
kidneyes comming of a hot cause, as well 
concerning the stone, and gravell, as in the gonorrhea: 
and dissolved or relented with oyle of roses, 
or elders, or of linseed; it is a very good medicine 
to heale burnings and scaldings. 
 
I doe use it in fractures after the first opening, 
covering the member at least two hands breadth 
upon the fracture, with the Emplaister spread upon 
cloth, and in great inflammation in summer 
time, I doe dissolve it in oyle of roses, and so apply 
it to the fracture: it is thus made:

cut, and the skin peeled off, and when it is grown 
[^p.23^] 
thicke, then take it from the fire and put in the 
white vitrioll in want of true Chalcites and work 
and incorporate them wel together, and thou shalt 
have a good Emplaister, which must be cooled, and 
made up in rowles. 
 
[}Emplaister of Bettony,}] 
 
IS and especiall plaister for wounds in the head. 
 
It is good in greene wounds and ulcers in any 
part of the body.

THis Emplaister I doe commonly use in healing 
Ulcers, which are hard to be cicatrized, and 
[^p.24^] [^Original misnumbered as p.40.^] 
it is marvelous good in curing Buboes, as well Veneriall 
as Pestilentiall. It is also the most incarnative

and bringeth forward a cold apostume, and 
the Emplaister Mellilot Simplex, which is made of 
the juice of Mellilot, Camomile, and Wormwood,

secret, and the best, and onlyest thing I ever knew 
in curing kybed heeles, and chilblaines, either broken

[}Emplastrum de minis.}] 
 
THis red Lead plaister discusseth humours, asswageth 
paines, mollifieth, repelleth; and is 
commonly used upon wounds and ulcers to further 
good healing, and induce a cicatrize; it is

of the shoulders, or breast; it easeth the Liver, 
Spleene, and guts, helpeth the three sorts of Dropsies; 
cures the paines of the upper guts, and the 
extreame fits of the Collick; comforts the reines,

it amendeth the distempers of them, it availeth 
much in the griefes of the matrix; it helpes the 
Gowth, Sciatica, and paine in the joynts; apply it 
to the stomack of those that have cold Feavers, and 
it helpes them; it cures the bitings of mad Dogs, 
and the stingings of Serpents, Snakes, or other venomous 
creatures, and is made as followeth: 
 
+R. Picis (Navalis i. ex navibus vetustis derasæ

[}Emplaistrum Diasulphuris.}] 
 
THe Emplaister Diasulphuris is most excellent in

THis Emplaister is hot and drye, it digesteth, 
resolveth, and dryeth up humours that are 
cold, moyst, thick, and clammy in the Scrophula, 
and other hard tumours springing from a cold 
cause; it mightily softens and resolves the Strumæ,

[}Sir Philip Paris Emplaister.}] 
 
THis Emplaister is excellent for divers things, 
if you lay it upon the stomack it provoketh 
appetite, and taketh away any griefe from the 
same; layd to the belly, it easeth the Collick speedily, 
layd to the reignes it stoppeth the bloudy flux, 
running of the reines, heat of the kidneys, and 
weaknesse of the back; it healeth swellings, aches, 
bruises; it breaketh fellons, and aposthumes, and 
healeth them; it draweth out humours without 
breaking the skin: it healeth the diseases of the 
fundament: layd upon the head it helpeth the 
head-ach, uvula, and eyes: layd to the belly, it 
provoketh the months, and apteth the matrice for 
conception. The composition is as followeth: 
 
+R. Olei communis, two pounds. 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Minii 
Cerussæ 
	of each one pound beaten small. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
Saponis castiliani twelve ounces. 
 
Incorporate these well together in an earthen pan, 
well glased before you put them to boyle, then put 
them upon a gentle fire of coales for one houre, ever 
stirring it with a spatula, then encrease fire till 
the red turne grayish, continuing your stirring; 
drop a little upon a trencher, if it cleave not thereto, 
[^p.36^] 
then it is enough; dip linen cloathes therein 
and smoth them with a sleekstone, the rest make up 
in rolles, it wil last twenty yeares. 
 
Let the Artist observe a true boyling of all Emplaisters; 
for over much boyling not onely makes 
the Emplaister too hard, but also evaporates the 
vertues of divers ingredients: likewise, too little 
boyling doth not incorporate them, neither will 
they stick upon the place, besides the inconvenience 
of carrying them; let all your gummes in any Emplaister 
be finely powdered, dissolved in sacke or 
Vineger, and strained through a canvas, and the vineger 
or sacke evaporated at the fire, and then put 
to the rest, where turpentine or saffron are added 
it must be when the rest are boyled enough, giving 
them but two or three walmes after you have put 
them in; and with those emplaisters which I have 
heere set downe, you need not feare to dresse any 
wound whether incised or contused, or any ulcer 
of what sort soever. 
 
Next I shall shew you what oyles and unguents 
it is needfull to have in readines for store, and how 
_[^ORIG. BLANK^]u shall make them, and they are these. 
 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^]

	Ægyptiacum, Arregon, 
	Album camphoratu~, Martiatum,

	Mel saporis, Tutia, 
	Dialthæa, Spleneticum. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
[^p.37^] 
[}And first of Ægyptiacum.}] 
 
THis unguent doth scoure and mundifie all rotten 
ulcers, and is best used scalding hot, for 
then the usuall paine and corrosion it procureth wil 
be the sooner past over; in like manner, it is to be 
used in any venomous wounds made either with 
poysoned shot, or bitten with mad dogs, or any other 
venomous creature, or in great contused 
wounds, wherein for preventing them form the 
feare of a gangrene it excelleth; it serveth also to 
be used alone, or mixed with any lotion for ulcers 
of the mouth or throat, especially in the scurvy. 
This unguent dryeth vehemently, and is abstersive 
of temperament hot and dry, and is made as followeth: 
 
+R. Eruginis, five drams. 
Mellis, fourteen drams. 
Aceti fortis, seven drams. 
 
Boyle them altogether to an oyntment thick and 
red. 
 
[}Album Camphoratum.}] 
 
THe white oyntment with Campheire is good to 
coole and heale any hot moyst pustles; it cureth 
excoriation of the skin in any place, but chiefly 
in the yard, betwixt glans and præputium; it 
also healeth burnings and scaldings very well, and 
is good to be applyed to any painfull ulcer, for it 
[^p.38^] 
asswageth paine, and healeth well; it is cold avodine, 
molificative, and attractive. It is made as 
followeth: 
 
+R. Olei Rosati, nine ounces. 
Cerussæ bonæ in aqua rosarum lotæ, 3 ounces. 
Ceræ albæ, two ounces, 
 
Make it into an oyntment accordind to Art, if you 
will have it with Camphire, then adde to this proportion 
of Camphire two drams. 
 
[}Unguentum Populeon.}] 
 
THis Oyntment serveth well to asswage the 
paines of the Scurvy, by annoynting the parts 
grieved therewith, it asswageth paine in any part 
of the body, and it easeth the dolour of a caustick 
medicine by being applied cold upon a plegent to 
the place grieved: It procures sleepe in Fevers, if 
you annoynt the temples, palmes of the hands, and 
soles of the feet therewith: it is cold and moyst, 
and is made as followeth.
