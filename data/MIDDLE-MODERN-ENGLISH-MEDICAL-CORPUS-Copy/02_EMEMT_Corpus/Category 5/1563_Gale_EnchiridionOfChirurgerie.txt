[}The first booke.}] 
 
FOr as muche as in this present 
treatise (which I do compile for 
the instruction of those that professe 
Chirurgerie) I do purpose 
to entreat orderly of wounds, 
fractures and dislocations: I 
thinke good first of all to set out what a wound 
is, and howe manye differences there be of 
woundes. Howe be it my principall scope tendeth 
rather to teache the practise then the theorike 
at this present. Therefore a wounde is 
named a solution of continuitie, newely made 
in the softer partes of the bodye, without putrifaction, 
corruption, or matter. For if anye 
matter, putrifaction, or corruption foloweth, 
then is it no more called a wou~de but an vlcer. 
Of wounds I doe make two differences: for 
either it happeneth in the similer partes, as in 
fleshe, arterie, vayne, nerue, bone &c, or els in 
the organicke or instrumentall partes. Of 
[^f.1v^] 
these two sortes of woundes we wyll nowe seuerally 
intreate. And for because the least and 
smalest wounds, require least labour, diligence 
and connyng, and that the studient muste in 
most easiest things be first exercised and trained 
vp: I wyll shewe you briefely the cure of a simple 
and small wounde, where the skynne onely 
is diuided or cut. You shall aptly ioyne the 
lippes or sides of the wounde together so euen 
as possible you can: then make a stufe wyth 
towe and the whyte of an egge mixed with a 
litle salte, and apply it to the wounde, then rolle 
and bynde it accordyng to arte, and this is sufficient 
in such kynde of woundes. You must also 
commaunde the Pacient that he exercise not 
the wounded member, least that he causeth accidentes 
to fall to the wounde, as inflamation, 
fluxe of humours, dolour, and payne. &c. 
 
[}The cure of great and depe woundes, 
and of diuers kyndes of stiching. 
Cap. ii.}] 
 
IF the wounde be great in the fleshe, and yet 
without accidents, you shall beginne your 
cure as in the chapter before, that is by comprisyng 
and ioyning the sydes of the wounde 
together, and than rollynge and byndyng it. 
But if the wounde be bigge, wyde, or els ouerthwarte 
[^f.2r^] 
the member, so that rollinge and binding 
are not sufficient: than you are compelled 
to vse stiching, of whiche there be diuers sortes, 
and I wyll set oute those whiche are moste in 
vse. But or you goe aboute the stitching of the 
wounde, geue diligent heede that it be mundified 
and made cleane, that there remayne not in 
it eyther any vncleanesse, as heare, duste, oyle, 
or suche lyke: whiche may hynder the adglutination 
of the wounde. You must for your stiching 
prepare a three square Needle made holow 
in the eye, that the threde maye the easier 
folowe, and let your threede be euen without 
knottes, well twyned and waxed. Then your 
stiching shalbe in this sorte. Make your firste 
stiche in the middes of the wounde, than a fingar 
breadeth from that make another on bothe 
sides of the midle stich, & so leauing the space of a 
fyngar breadeth, make so manye stiches as the 
wounde requireth. And take this for a generall 
rule that you neuer begynne your stiching at 
the ende of the wounde, because through that 
occation the wounde might be drawen awrye, 
and the member lose his beautie, and sometyme 
parte of his office. And beginning your 
stiches in the middes, this foloweth of necessitie, 
that your stiches shalbe odde, if there be 
more or lesse than twaine. And if the wound be 
deepe and ouerthwarte the member, then you 
[^f.2v^] 
must make your stiches deeper and that for two 
causes, the one for that it shoulde not breake out 
againe the other that the wounde myghte haue 
lesse matter and better take consolidation. And 
when you haue thus stitched the wounde you 
must ouer cast the threide twise or thrise or you 
knit your knot: otherwyse it wyll breake out or 
you can knit your knot the proof of which I haue 
sene among the vnlearned surgeons. And when 
your wounde is thus stiched then take tow and 
make a stufe with the whight of an egge & thys 
pouder folowing and lay it on the wounde, and 
though it hath not beene vsed before this tyme, 
yet it is bothe better and more conuenient then 
that which is mencioned in the last chapter and 
this is the first kind of stiching.

[^f.3r^] 
THe second kynd of stitching is to sowe ouer 
the hand as the skinners doe, which is vsed 
in woundes of the intestines or where as 
Siphach is sowed to Mirach. The thirde kind 
is to put the needle through both the lipps of the 
wounde letting it so still to remayne and winde 
the threede sixe or seuen times about the neadle 
& thys is vsed in wyde and large woundes. The 
fourth maner of stiching is when as a vayne or 
arterie is cut and we vse to stay the flux of blood 
especially whe~ as vene iugulares is cut. Then 
we thurst the needle through that vaine or arterye 
and then knit the same with the thried, then 
draw out the needle & let a portion of the threed 
hange out so longe vntyll it falleth awaye. The 
fyft sort of stiching is vsed in wou~des of the face 
or delicate and tender bodies which are not able 
to sustayne the paine of stiching with the needle. 
And the stiching is in this sort. Take litle peices 
of linnin cloth three square and spreade on them 
this vnguent folowing. And lay on euery syde 
of the wounde the peces of cloth euery one from 
other an inche and when as the clothes are dried 
well, then stich them and drawe them together 
and vse the wounde in all other pointes as is afore 
sayde.

[}Of woundes in vaynes and arteries. 
Chap. iii.}] 
 
WHen as it happeneth that the vaynes are 
cut & wounded you must diligently marke 
whether they be Venæ capillares (that is 
to say) small vaines like heare, or ells any of the 
greater vaynes. If they be the smalle vaynes it 
shal suffyce to stiche the wound and vse the pouder 
desiccatiue mencioned in the chapter goyng 
before, with twoe and the whighte of an Egge. 
But if any of the great vaines be wou~ded, then 
the cure aforesaid is not sufficient. Wherefore 
you may attempt to stay the fluxe of bloud with 
binding the contrary side to the place wounded: 
or with letting of blood in another place wherby 
there is made diuersion of the fluxe. Also wyth 
frictions and rubbing the contrary parts. Yf 
these suffice not then you must applye causticke 
[^f.4r^] 
pouders as Arsenicum sublimatum, Uitriall 
burnt, vnsleked lime, or such like, or ells make 
cauterization with an yron, or stiche the ende of 
the vaine. And lay some desiccatiue pouder on it 
and so dresse the wounde lettyng it so remayne 
foure daies. And if there be any asker, you must 
apply to it the whight of an egge & oile of Roses 
well beaten together. And the cure that is heare 
spoken of vaines, is also to be vnderstand of arteries: 
and the way to know whether a vaine or 
arterie is wounded: is by the yssuing oute of the 
blood. For in an arterie cut, the blood co~meth leping 
and springing out with sume staye accordinge 
to the dilatation and compressyon of the 
arterye.

of blood, the pulce beganne to cease & the childes 
[^f.4v^] 
sight to decaie. Lanfranke comming by, laid his 
finger on the mouth of the wounde to staye the 
flux of bloud: then he tempered the pouder with 
the wheight of an egge, and laid it to the wou~d, 
lettyng it so remaine fower daies: and when he 
would haue taken it away: it was so dry and cleued 
so faste to, that it myghte not be remoued 
w~out payne, wherefore he applyed the whyte 
of an Egge & oyle of Roses beaten together to 
the place vntyll the next daye, and the wound 
was founde perfitely healed, to the great admiration 
of the people whych dyd beholde it.

[^f.5v^] 
IN a wound it may happen the nerue to be diuided 
in length, & sometime ouertwrat which 
is very perilous. Also sometyme the nerue is 
pricked with a nedle, bodkin, alle, throne or such 
like. Unto all this to cease the doloure and pain 
of so sencible a part, you shall vse oyle of Roses 
made wyth Oleum omphacinum, somewhat 
warmer then the pacient can well suffer. Also 
you may make a good digestiue of fine Turpentine 
well wasshed in the waters of plantyne, or 
Hipericon, & apply it to the wound. And if these 
with often application ceaseth not the dolour & 
payne: then take Olei rosacei two Unces, Boli 
armeni two dragmes, & opij a litle: mixt these to 
gether and apply it warme to the wounde. And 
when the payne is ceased and the wounde draweth 
to maturation: then you may heale it with 
the drinke and plaster vsed in greene woundes, 
which you shall fynde in the antidotarye. You 
shall also not onely in wounded Neruis, but also 
in all other wounds vse Vnguentum de vermibus, 
whose composition is in this maner.

[^f.7r^] 
[}Of woundes in whiche are fyxed 
thornes, splinttes of wode, arrow 
heades, gonneshotte, or 
such lyke. Chap. v.}] 
 
WHen as in woundes their happeneth to be 
fixed thornes, splentes of woode, arrowe 
heades, gonshotte or such other like, and 
the orifice of the wounde is so narrow that with 
instrument it cannot be taken out, you must of 
necessitie labour to enlarge the wounde, which 
you may do two sondry waies. The one is with 
tentes as of the roote of gentian, pithe of elder, 
or a peece of a sponge: the other is to make incision 
with a paire of cisers or with sheres whose 
fygure is in the institution. There be 
also when as the wound is enlarged diuers and 
proper instrumentes to take out w~ such thinges 
as are there infixid as to~ges or nippers, & teribillis, 
whose pictures are in the Booke before 
named. Also you shall know in deape wou~des 
what part is hurt by these signes folowing. As 
the braine beyng wou~ded he shal voide scomme 
and fome at the mouth. If the hart be wounded, 
their yssueth out bloude blacke in colour. Also if 
the longs be wounded, the blood is like a scu~me. 
But yf the stomacke be perced the meate indegest 
commeth out. In like maner the intestines 
being wou~ded, the odour issueth. Further more 
[^f.7v^] 
the vrine floweth out in wounds of the bladder: 
and so by that which is co~teined in the member, 
you shall coniecture the wounded part. Now as 
touching the taking oute of suche thinges as be 
fixed in the wounded member, you may procede 
principally three sondry wayes. Fyrst you may 
vse suche instrumentes before set oute as shall 
seme most necessarie. Secondlye if the thynge 
fixed be forkyd as a broad arrowe head or suche 
like, and be perced through the greater parte of 
the member: then it shalbe much better to thurst 
it through the member then to take it out at the 
orifice of the wounde. Laste of all if these twoo 
wayes wyll not serue, because of the wounded 
place, then as much as you can make the wou~d 
wider by tents or incision, and lay maturatiues 
to it certaine daies, and then that which is contained 
in the wounde will with lesse difficultye 
come forth. You shall commaunde the pacient 
to laye on the wounded syde, because the drynke 
whych I vse in such woundes may the more readely 
come to the wounded part. The composition 
of this drinke you shall fynde in the antidotarie. 
Also you may vse thys playster folowynge 
to the wounde whych is right good in extraxion 
of such thinges as are fixed on woundes.

woundes. Chap. vi.}] 
 
[^f.9r^] 
IN contusyd woundes the methode curatiue 
differeth from that which hetherto is mencioned. 
For in these wou~des first you shall apply 
maturatiues, whereby that which is brosid and 
separated from the vnitie of the part may be turned 
to matter (they call it in Latyne sanies velpus) 
and when it commeth to maturation: then 
you muste vse mundificatiues to mundifie the 
wounde, vntill it be cleane and voyde of matter. 
Then your next intention is to ingender fleshe 
which you must doe w~ incarnatiue medicines, 
& euer be diligent to defende the contusid member 
from accidentes with oyle of Roses warme 
applied to the same. As touching maturatiues, 
mundificatiues, and incarnatiues, you shal find 
them in my antidotarye and in dyuers partes 
of thys worke. 
 
[}Of deepe and hydden woundes 
whyche can not be well perceyued. 
Chap. vii.}] 
 
IN this kynd of woundes the cure is done two 
sundry wayes. First if the place may suffer it 
without hurt of vaines, arteries, & nerues, is 
to delate the wounde with tentes of gentian or 
of a sponge and after make it open & large wyth 
insicion. The other is if the first waye cannot be 
done without daunger, to put into the wound a 
[^f.9v^] 
probe or waxe candle, vntil you come to the end 
of the wounde, and make there an yssue that by 
this way the matter in the wound may be clensed 
with some mendificatiue lotion conuaied in 
to the wou~d by a syring. Let your rolling also be 
such y~ it be lose at the orifie of your wou~d, for otherwise 
you shal kepe y~ matter stil in y~ wou~d. 
Neither shall you in mundifiynge the wounde 
thurst out the mater, for so doing you shal thurst 
out the indigest matter in colour of blood & hynder 
much the cure of the wou~de. As Brunswik 
maketh mention of a certayne Barbour who 
had no knowledge in Chirurgery, and yet wold 
take vpon him to practise. Thys Barbour (hauing 
a pacient wounded in the arme) did euery 
day thurst out so much bloude and brought such 
accidentes to the parte, that yf Brunswyke had 
not fortunatly come, the Barbours pacient had 
loste hys arme. Suche is the fruictes of blynde 
Emperikes. You shall also aboue the wounde 
applye some defensiue, and on the wound some 
mundificatiue, and make your iniections wyth 
a syring vntill the water come forth of the same 
colour it was put in. The water vsed for iniections 
is made in this maner.

[}Of wounds in the bones. Chap. viii.}] 
 
THe solution of continuitie in the bone is in 
diuers sundry wyse as fractures, splentes 
caries, and by wound: of which last we will 
onely in this chapter make mention. If the bone 
wounded doth hange to the panicle which inuested 
& couereth the bone, then doe what you can 
to cause it to ioyne. But yf thys panicle be also 
cut, then will not the wounde be fylled wyth 
flesh except the peeces deuided be taken awaye. 
And to the wounded bone you shall vse Vnguentum 
aureum ex mesues prescripto. After 
you must applye mundificatiues and consoladatiues 
set out in the antidotary, and see that you 
vse in this wounde apte ligature and that it be 
open vpon the wound, that you may daily apply 
medicynes to the place wythout loseinge of the 
coller. Furthermore you muste laye aboute the 
[^f.11r^] 
wounde some defensiatiue whereby the parte 
shalbe preserued from diuers & sondrye accidentes 
which might fall to the wounde. The Chirurgian 
must also haue regarde that the pacient 
keepe a moderate diet and that he be soluble in 
body. Which if it cannot be by nature, then procure 
it may be done by art. As by purgation, clister 
or suppositorie. And in all other thynges the 
cure of this wounde differeth not from the cure 
of other woundes. 
 
[}Of a newe kynd of curyng grene 
and freeshe woundes wyth 
balme. Chap. ix.}] 
 
THe healing of greene wounds by balme artificiall 
is in this wyse. Close the wounde 
and stiche it make it cleane w~ a dry sponge 
and put of the baulme into the wound very hote 
and dresse it twise euery day. And here you must 
note that thys balme taketh not like effecte in al 
greene woundes. For the cure differeth accordyng 
to the countrie, complexion of the partie & 
place that is wou~ded. For if the country be hote, 
the pacient colerike and the wound in the head, 
the baulme taketh not lyke effect nor is to be 
ministred as afore is said. For the cou~try beyng 
whote, and the pacient whoote the wound can 
not be cured w~ balme which is also hoote. And 
[^f.11v^] 
it is a maximum in phisicke, that infirmities are 
taken away by their contraryes. How then shall 
the medicynes lyke in qualityes to the region 
and complexion, cure the infirmity? Except you 
wyll aunswere me it doth it aproprietate totius 
substantie, which is nothinge so. What then, 
shall not Balme cure woundes in the fore named 
pacientes? Yeas verylye, and I wyll 
shewe you in what maner. Stich your wound 
as is before mencioned, and mundifye it wyth 
a drye sponge not dypte in water and take away 
all the blode aboute it: then take Cotten and 
make a stuphe and dyppe it in Oyle of Roses 
and Balme not heate, of eche equall portions 
and applye it to the wound. And defende the 
woundes wyth all diligence from accidentes 
wyth some defensiue: for to Colorike persons in 
whote regions there commeth accidentes spedelye. 
The lyke cure shall be in woundes where 
as the boone is seene. Excepte that you must 
adde to the Oyle and Baulme, Turpentyne 
well wasshed and the stuphe beynge layde on 
the wounde, you maye further vse the emplaster 
whych customably is occupyed in grene 
wounds. And yf the region be coulde, the pacient 
flegmatycke, and the parte fleshye then applye 
your Baulme whote, for in those there folowe 
of course small accidentes, except it be by 
disorder of the pacient & fault of the Chirurgian 
[^f.12r^] 
and great woundes in these persons wil sone be 
curied. For this artificial balme hath in him the 
vertue attractiue, conglutinatiue, & desiccatiue: 
his discription you shal finde in the antidotarie. 
Also in whote regions, colde complextions: and 
in colde regions, colericke persons shall soner be 
curied: then where both region & temperature of 
the pacient agree in whotnes. The like is to be 
vnderstand of the time of the yere. For y~ colerik 
person being wou~ded shal soner be curied with 
balme in winter, then somer. Also the wounde 
being dressed, there are thre kind of ligatures or 
roillings vsed as necessitie requireth. The first 
maketh fleshe in the wounde to grow & is called 
incarnatiue. The second doth expel such matter 
and superfluitie as combreth the wound & thys 
rolling is named expulsiue. The third reteineth 
& kepeth the sides of the wou~ds together, & such 
medicines as are applyed thereto and is called 
retentiue. Of them in our institutio~ of Chirurgerye 
we do make a most ample discours. And 
thus briefly and compendiously we haue passed 
ouer the principal woundes which may happen 
in the similer partes? Nowe tyme and 
order requireth that wyth the lyke methode 
we intreate of woundes in 
the instrumentall 
partes.

[}The second booke of 
the Enchiridion, conteyning the curation of 
woundes in the instrumentall parts: 
By Thomas Gale Maister in 
Chirurgerie.}] 
 
ALthoughe it myghte seme sufficiente 
for the generall cure of 
wounds to haue made mention 
of those which are conteyned in 
the first Booke: yet seyng perticuler 
exercise in the instrumentall parts is both 
delectable and profitable: and is as it were a master 
which teacheth: I wyll indeuor my selfe to 
set out perticulerly the cure of woundes in the 
instrumentall partes. And I call an instrumentall 
parte, whych is not simple but compounded 
of the similar, as the head, the eye, the hand, the 
arme, and such like. And for because I wil orderly 
intreate of them: I do deuide the body of man 
into .iiij. partes, that is to saye, into three ventricules, 
and that whych the anotomistes do cal 
artus, conteyning the armes and legges. The 
first ventricle containyng the aninimall spirits 
geuing sence and motion to the whole bodye is 
the heade. The second comprehending the vitall 
spirites is from os furculæ vntyll Diaphragma: 
[^f.13r^] 
where the inferior ventricle receyuing the liuer 
stomacke, splene, kidnyes, intestines, bladder 
and dyuers other partes doth begynne: and endeth 
at os pubis. And for because the soule is the 
most noble part of man and hath hys seat in the 
head, I wyll begynne wyth the woundes of the 
head first, and set forth suche thinges for the preseruation 
of this so principall a part as my poore 
knowledge and experience wyll extende vnto. 
And here loke not that I will waste tyme in rehearsing 
of weapons wherwyth the part is hurt 
as diuers do. For it helpeth nothing to the cure 
of the wounde, to say he was hurt wyth a staffe 
clubbe, sword, shotte, fall, or such like: but rather 
to loke to the wounde selfe: whether it be a simple 
wounde, or that it be compounde: whether it 
be contused, or els but cut: and so folowing the 
differences set out in the first Booke. 
 
[}Of certayne generall preceptes, 
necessarye to be folowed 
in the cure of wounds 
of the heade. Chap. i.}] 
 
WOunds in the head are diuers and sondry, 
some are but simple woundes, beinge cut 
w~out anye accidents or hurt of Cranium, 
som be with cutting also of Cranium. Some be 
contused and yet Cranium perfyte, other happeneth 
[^f.13v^] 
with the breaking of Cranium, some are 
with perishing of Dura, vel Pia mater, and losse 
of some substaunce of the braine, and others are 
w~out. But for that I woulde you should know 
whether the Cranium, be fractured or not, I wil 
giue you certain proper preceptes. If the contusion 
be great, yf he fall from anye highe place, or 
haue a greate stroke, if when he reteyneth hys 
breath there co~meth out moistnes through the 
diuision or fracture of the bone, also vomitinge, 
vertigo, bleding at the nose or eares, the eies red 
and swolne, want of speche, a sharp feuer, & difficultie 
of makinge his vrine: all these shewe 
Cranium, to be fractured. There is also another 
note to know Cranium fractured, and that is to 
streke on Cranium, ynke or Mastick and if there 
be any fracture, then in the place there wyll appeare 
blacknes, which is a most certayne token 
that y~ Cranium, is fractured. Also in your prognostication 
you must consyder these briefe sentenses. 
Greate breaken of Cranium, is perilous, 
and the wound in the braine or corruption of the 
Dura, vel Pia mater, is deadly and mortall. Yf 
the blacknes of Dura mater, whan it happeneth 
cannot be taken awaye wyth Mell rosaceum, 
it is a token of death. Also the Cranium, or brain 
wounded at such time as the moone is at the ful 
(that is when she is in opposyon of the sunne) it 
[^f.14r^] 
is very perilous. And in curinge the wounde yf 
there be a tumor or swellyng and that same soddenly 
vanishe, it is perilous. But in the consolidation 
of Cranium, if the fleshe appeareth redde 
it is a good sygne. Lyke as if in the wound there 
be good digestion and no acidentes comming to 
the same. And for because in curing the wounds 
of the head there is diuersytie in workynge and 
diuers opinions: I thinke it good to set oute certaine 
documentes whiche I take oute of the famous 
Guido, whose words are these folowing. 
[/1./] 
First saith he the woundes of the head w~ breaking 
of the bone haue much difference from the 
woundes of the other members both for the nerues 
to Cerebalis Medullæ so noble a part, & also 
for the rou~d and spherelike figure and forme 
of the head, which hindreth vnition and is vnapt 
for ligature and rolling. Secondly that in great 
woundes of the head it is nedeful for to obserue 
the commo~ intentions mencioned before in the 
treatise of Phleubotomie and purgie~. That the 
body be soluble which if naturally it chaunceth 
not, then by suppositorie, clyster, or ientle lenytiue, 
you must make it lose. Also y~ diet thin. &c. 
Thirdly that in woundes of the heade the heare 
be shauen & take heede that no heare oyle or water 
fall into the wound which may let consolidation 
of the wound, and that to resist dolour both 
aboue & vnder: apply the white of an egge. And 
[^f.14v^] 
after the beginning let thynges be vsed as is aforesaid 
to mundifie and incarnate. And rounde 
about the wound alwais vse the vnguent with 
bole armoniake & oile of Roses, that the dolour 
& distemperance of the part be asswagied & al apostimatio~ 
put backe. Forthly as you haue often 
hard of Hippocrates, that all couldnes is hurtefull 
to nerues, bones, and marowe, and also the 
aire doth hurt and alter the principal members. 
And therfore in winter whan the pacient is dressed 
let the windowes be close shutte and a good 
fire of coales, & dresse him wyth a candle & when 
he is dressed put on his heade a coyfe or cap made 
of a shepes skinne. Fiftly if the wounde be come 
to digestion and hath matter co~teined in it, that 
it be remoued away with fine linte or cotten so 
softly as may be, and this in winter must be but 
ones, and in somer twise. Sextly that vppon the 
tentes there be laide a soft spong to suck & draw 
and receiue out the matter that it falleth not to 
the braine. Seuently that you haue a role a yard 
long and foure fyngers broode, and that you shal 
rolle it vp within .ii. handful of the ende & begin 
the ligature at the forehead, and extende it towardes 
to eares opposite to the wound and the 
other parte to the eare nexte the wounde leauyng 
the eares vncouered. And let the rouller 
come downewarde to the fyrste byndynge and 
dor it so manye tymes vntyll the heade be couered. 
[^f.15r^] 
&c. Eyghtly take heede yf there remayne 
anye skale of a bone, wasshe the wounde wythe 
Wyne. Yf there be no feuer gyue hym thys 
pouder folowyng.

Last of all that the pacient lay on the side whiche 
least greueth him vnto there be founde matter 
in the wound: and then he muste rest on the 
wounded parte that the matter maye the more 
redily voide. Thus much in effect touching Giudo 
his counsaile. Also I wyshe from the first beginning 
of the wound vntil such time as there 
is no feare of apostimation y~ you vse some mitigatiue 
as oyle of Roses three Unces, Honnye 
one dragme mixe them together. And then you 
may also vse this pouder whych dryeth without 
corrosion or pricking.

good to write before I entred the perticuler cure 
of organike woundes, being as guides & counselers 
to be folowed thorow this hole boke. Now 
wil I begin and show their methodicall cure. 
 
[}Of symple woundes in the heade 
wyth cutting, which happeneth 
without hurt of Cranium, chap. ii.}] 
 
IF the wounde be symple wythoute hurte of 
Craniu~, or losse of substance: then is the cure 
of it like the cure of other woundes 
to stiche, rolle, incarnate, and cicatrize. But 
yf the wounde be wyth the losse of substaunce 
then you must dyppe your tents and couer your 
plegeantes wyth incarnatyues, and Cicatrize 
the wounde with your accustomed pouders. vnguentes, 
emplasters, and other thyngs thereto 
belongynge. As touchynge stiching in the heade 
because manye speake agaynste it: I affyrme it 
to be not onelye profitable in small woundes, 
but also in great, most necessarye. For it kepeth 
[^f.16r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.19.^] 
the partes separated together, which rolling can 
not, it also causeth that the aire dothe not alter 
the part, whych where it chaunceth it is verye 
hurtfull. And here I except great woundes in 
the fore parte of the heade whiche maye not be 
stiched but on the syde. And putting in it oyle of 
Roses which doth both take awaye the payne of 
the neruous panicle inuestynge and couerynge 
Cranium, yf the wounde be so deepe and also it 
maketh the bones more easye to be taken oute, 
and taketh away the sharpenes of Mell when 
with it we intende to mundifie any inward panicle 
and defendeth from accidentes. 
 
[}Of woundes in the head with cuttynge 
and fracturynge or breakyng 
of Cranium, but not through 
percyng. Chap. iii.}] 
 
THe woundes chaunsing in the head by cutting 
and fracturing of Cranium, going not 
through the whole substaunce of the same is called 
Rimula. Thys wounde eyther is greate or 
smalle, yf it be small it shall haue the same cure 
mencioned in the Chapter nexte goynge before 
thys. For in suche a wounde there is small generation 
of matter, and that ngendred through 
hys grosse substaunce, cannot discende in the cut 
[^f.16v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.19.^] 
or ryfte. But if the wounde be greate then is it 
eyther in the sydes of the head or vpper parte of 
the heade. Yf it be in the sydes, it hath also the 
same cure that the woundes in the Chapter goynge 
before receyueth. Excepte that in the lower 
part of the wound there be put a tent wher 
by yf anye matter be retayned in the wounde it 
may the easyer come out. But yf the wounde be 
in the vpper parte of the heade it maye not be 
stiched for that nature there cannot purge her 
selfe. Yf the fracture commeth to the myddes of 
of the two Tables of Cranium, it is nedefull to 
take sheres called Rugines of dyuers bygnes. 
And as the bone of the pacient is vncouered you 
shall vse the greatter Rugynes, then after take 
those that are narrower and so at length the narowest 
of all, and thys shall you doe at all times 
in the myddes of the two Tables. Thus shall 
you speedely cure thys wound wyth drying medicynes 
and tentes that shall sucke and drawe 
out the matter. 
 
[}Of woundes in the head in whiche 
Cranium is cut vnto the inwarde 
panicle, wythout losse of 
substaunce. Chap. iiii.}] 
 
[^f.17r^] 
THys kynde of wound wyll haue sometimes 
sparankes or sharpe peaces of bones and 
some are free from them and are euen 
without sharpe peaces of bone. Those that haue 
the sparankes doe hurte and offende that panicle 
which is called Dura mater. Therefore they 
must be taken away with a lenticuler and made 
smothe and euen and then is the cure of thys 
wounde lyke the other woundes in the former 
Chapter. For yf it be in the vpper parte of the 
heade you shall vse to mundifye and desiccate 
withoute stichen, yf it be in the sydes, then in the 
lower part of the wounde you muste put a tent 
as is aforesayde that the matter maye the easier 
come oute. 
 
[}Of woundes in the heade contusyd 
wyth oute fracturing of 
Cranium. Chap. v.}] 
 
IT is the proper scope of curyng this wounde 
to apply to it medicines that resyst flux and repell 
the matter back. Usyng in the beginning 
after the accustomed maner y~ white of an egge 
mixed with oile of Roses. And so resoluynge 
the matter gathered, you shall vse Honnye and 
wine in which salt hath be nput. But if it come 
to maturation then you shall open it and vse 
the cure to it that is proper for apostumes and 
[^f.17v^] 
suche medicynes as are mencioned in the generall 
chapter of contused woundes. 
 
[}Of woundes in the heade wyth 
contusion and where Cranium, is 
lytle fractured. Chap. vi.}] 
 
YOu muste diligentlye looke whether in the 
place whereas Cranium is fractured, there 
are anye sharpe peeces of bones, whych yf 
there be, they must be remoued with the lenticuler 
as is afore mencioned. Then you shall 
dresse the wounde and laye thereon softe silke 
wette in Honny of Roses and oyle of Roses and 
wyth your instrument you shall put in the lynnen 
cloth betwixte Dura mater, and Cranium. 
And laye on it softe tents wette in mel ros. and 
oyle of Roses and apply there on a lynnen cloth 
wette in the same, and on the wounde of the 
fleshe put eyther dry linte or a soft spong to suke 
vp the matter and apply an head plaster that the 
matter, close not wyth in. After which you shall 
in Wyne made whoote, weete towe and presse 
out the Wyne wyth your hand and laye that 
also on then vppon that put drye towe and rolle 
it softely that the thynges applyed, maye abide 
on the wounde. And when the wound is mundifyed 
then leaue of the fyrste clothe, and vse the 
[^f.18r^] 
head pouder to make the wound incarnate and 
so with consolidatiues and medicines inducing 
a cicatrice you shall procede vntyll the wounde 
be perfytely cured. 
 
[}Of wounds contusid with great 
fracture of Cranium, Chap. vii.}] 
 
COntusyd woundes with great breaking of 
Cranium must be cured after this methode. 
First you must shaue the here away, then w~ 
an incision knyfe you shall cutte the place crosse 
wise or as other do vse, whiche is not so good 
after thys maner. Then rayse of the fleshe and 
make the fractured bone open and bare. And yf 
there folowe any fluxe of bloud, you must clence 
the wounde wyth lynnen clothes dipt in water 
and Uinegre or the white of an egge an if there 
be no flux of bloude fyll the wounde wyth drye 
lynt and dippe clothes in oyle and wine & applye 
it to the place and bynd vp the wound as therto 
belo~geth. Then if there foloweth no accidentes 
which maye hinder the cure of the bone: open the 
wounde and let the pacientes eares be stopped 
wyth lint or cotte~ that he hereth not for making 
him faint harted & affraid. And let two me~ stay 
his head with their handes, and then with your 
knife departe the bone or wyth the lenticuler. 
[^f.18v^] 
But if this cannot be done both spedely & wyth 
out great payne. then set a trappen and bore it 
throughe so many tymes vntill it be separated 
from Cranium, and you shall take awaye thys 
bone fractured fyrst lifting it vp wyth an eleuatory 
vntill you may take it away with your nippers 
or fingers. Then you must make y=e= edgies 
of the bone smothe and euen. And after cure it 
in all cases as you cure woundes where Cranium 
is fractured wyth the takynge oute peeces 
of bones. 
 
[}Of woundes in the face. Chap. viii.}] 
 
WOunds in the face are eyther in the fleshy 
partes or not, yf in the fleshie partes, the 
wounde is eyther drye or moiste. If in thy 
fleshye parte and the wounde moiste, you must 
of force stich it with a fine smal round nedle and 
fine threed: but yf it be in the fleshy part and dry 
you shal in the place of a rou~d nedle vse a square 
If the wound be not in the fleshy partes then in 
any case you must leaue of stiching & in the place 
of it to ioyne the lippes of the wounde together 
you shall doe in thys maner. Take Sanguinis 
draconis calcis ex testis ouorum, Mastiches, 
as much as is sufficient make in pouder & temper 
them with Honny vntill it come to the substance 
of hony. Then prepare .ij. linen clothes 
accordyng to the length of the wound & spreade 
[^f.19r^] 
of it vpon the clothes, and then vnto ether side of 
the wounde applye a clothe and suffer it to drye. 
Then w~ your needle take your stiches on both 
clothes and vnite, and ioyne the sydes of the 
wounde so euen and ryght as maye possible be, 
whyche thynges done laye on the wounde thys 
pouder folowyng.

And aplye it to the wound. After you shall heale 
it with the same plasters, vnguents, pouders, or 
balme as you accustomably do another wound. 
 
[}Of woundes in the eyes. Chap. ix.}] 
 
ALl woundes in the eyes or aboute the eyes 
are daungerous both for the nerenes of the 
braine, and also for perrill & losse of syght. 
Yea it happeneth often that through woundes 
about the eies the nerues optick haue ben stopped 
& there haue also folowed somtimes a cataracke. 
What is then to be loked for, whe~ as the 
wound happeneth in the substaunce of the eye? 
Galene maketh mentio~ of one hurt in y~ white 
[^f.19v^] 
of the eyes and much moysture flowed out and 
yet the pacient restored to hys syght. In like sort 
doth Brunswycke rehearse the lyke historye of 
two children wounded in the eye and muche 
moysture came forth and he curyed them wyth 
thys water folowyng. But these cures are de 
raro contingentibus.

These did he temper and myxe togyther and 
applied it to the eie? As he affirmeth to the great 
comforte and restoring of sight in the children aforesaid. 
But I will go to the cure of woundes 
of the eies which is without perishing of sight. 
Yf anye be wounded throughe the vpper or nether 
parte of the eye so that it hange downe, 
then wythe a needle beyng bent croked, aptelye 
for the eye and a sylke threede well waxed you 
shall verye Fynele styche it vp that the tumour 
of the eye maye be the lesser. 
[^f.20r^] 
And put into the sighte of the eye the water before 
mencioned, and make a Plaster of the 
whyte of an Egge, Sangui. draconis, and frankences 
and laye it rounde aboute the eye, but 
beware that it touche not the eye selfe. Also you 
maye heale it with Baulme, but be diligent 
none fall into the eye, and euer vse the water 
aforesayde, whiche is a wonderfull defensiue 
and letteth accidents to come to the place. 
And this shall you perfitly cure the eye. And yf 
the wounde come with arrow head, or sworde, 
you shall procede with oyle of Roses, and yf 
any thing be fixed in the wounde, worke after 
the doctrine set out in that Chapter. And when 
the thyng fixed is out, fyll the wounde wyth 
oyle of Roses, tempered with the yelke of an 
Egge warme, and mundifie the wound with 
mel Rosarum, farina Hordei, & Fenogreci, 
after applye incarnatiues, and heale the wound 
with the plaster vsed in greene wounds. But 
if it be wou~ded w~ nedle or thorne, vse the mundificatiue 
and defensiue aboute the eye, and 
washe the eye with this colyrium folowing vntyll

Egge shelles, &c: and aboute the place lay some 
defensiue. And the iij. day applye oyle of Roses

wounde with Mel rosarum, farina hordei,

THe wounde of the mouthe hath nothing 
proper to it selfe, but is stiched, defended, 
mundified, incarnated and cicatrized, after 
the maner of other greene woundes, therefore 
it were superfluous to make a vayne rehersall 
of the cure & medicines, seyng it is playnly set 
out before, and medicines prescribed which are 
thereto conuenient.

WOunds in the neck somtyme are made in

great vaines & arteries, & sometime in the passages 
where as brethe, meate & drinke, goeth in. 
If it be in the fleshe, it differeth not fro~ the cure 
of other greene wounds, but w~ stiching pouder 
wine & other accustomed medicines it is cured 
If it be in the ligaments, cordes & vaynes, take 
deepe stiches in the fleshie parts about the ligaments, 
cordes & nerues, & then cure it with oyle 
of ground wormes, & the plaster vsed in greene 
[^f.23r^] 
wounds. If it be in the great vaynes & arteries 
there is great perill, through the great fluxe of

[}Of woundes in the brest. 
Cap. xiiii.}] 
 
WOundes in the Breste either are without 
percing through the same, or ells they are 
into the brest. If they be without percing 
into the body, they are cured as other greene 
woundes, with towe dipte in the restrictiue 
pouder, and layed to the wounde, and with 
the Iewes plaster, or the plaster incustomed in 
greene woundes, or elles with Balme. But if 
the wounde be percing through, then it is eyther 
with bloode falling inwardly and hurte of 
some inwarde part, or elles it is without fluxe 
inwarde, or percing of any inwarde member. 
Howe you shall by signes knowe if anye of the 
inwarde partes be hurte, I haue set oute at 
large in the fyfte Chapter of the first booke. 
As touching the cure of woundes in the breste, 
which are without hurte of any inwarde parte, 
you shall in no wyse tente them, but stiche the 
wound, & with stufes dypt in wyne, vnguentes 
incarnatiue, emplasters, and conuenient rollyng, 
heale it vp lyke another wound. But if it 
be percing through, and he bleed inwardly and 
some of the inward parts are hurt, then with al 
expedition and haste, you must labour to bring 
out such bloode and matter as is within conteyned, 
and you must put in a tent large & long, on 
[^f.24v^] 
whiche you shall streke oyle of Roses, & fasten a 
threde to the tent that it goe not in, and so put 
the pacient to great payne. The pacient must be 
layde vpon a borde on the wou~ded side, & so moued 
to & fro that the matter maye come out at 
the wound, & make iniections of wyne or Mellicratum 
with a syringe, diligentlye markinge 
the quantitie and colour of the wyne or Mellicratum 
when it cometh out, for if it be lyke 
in quantitie & colour, then you neede no more 
to make iniections for all the matter within conteyned 
is quite voyded at the wounde: Or you 
may boyle in oyle of Camomile, Lupines, mel 
rosarum, & Myrrhe, vntyll the iij. part be consumed, 
then strayne it & make iniections with a 
syring as afore, and then shorten your tent, and 
apply this mu~dificatiue folowing to y=e= wound.

[}Of woundes in the thirde & lowest 
ventricle, called vsually the Belly. 
Chap. xv.}] 
 
THere are properlye three sundrye simple 
woundes in the region of the belly according 
to which there is three diuers cures. 
For either it is a smale wounde not percing 
through: or elles it perceth through, and so doth 
hurte of necessitie some of the inwarde partes, 
but yet they come not out: Or elles it perseth 
through with hurte of the inwarde partes, by 
reason of whiche they come forthe. You shall 
knowe what parte inwardlye conteyned is 
wounded by theyr proper sygnes set out in the 
the fyfte Chapter of the fyrst booke. 
[^f.26r^] 
As touching the cure of these woundes, I wyll 
seuerally intreate. If the wounde in the Belly 
be but in the fleshye partes, withoute persyng 
through, then you shall stiche it, and heale it 
with Balme, or the plaster accustomed in 
greene woundes, without further difficultie. 
But if the wounde perseth through Siphac and 
Myrack, and yet hurteth no other of the inward 
membres nor they come not out, then the cure 
of this wounde shall be as is aforesayde in all 
thynges except stitchyng. For in the first stiche 
put the needle through the one lyppe of the 
wounde, but touche not Siphack: and after 
put the Needle through the other lyppe, and 
through Siphack and Myrach, and make a 
knot vppon the threede. In the seconde stitche 
thrust the Needle through the one lyppe, and 
and through Mirach and Siphack, but in puttyng 
the Needle through the other lyppe, you 
shall not touche Siphack but Mirach, & make a 
knot without, and so procede orderly vntyll the 
hole wou~d be stiched. And this is it that Galene 
sayth, sowe Siphacke to Myrach, because it is a 
neruous panicle, and without blood it can not 
of it selfe take consolidation. But yf any of the 
inwarde parts, as the stomake, Lyuer, Splene, 
Intestines, or Bladder, be wounded, and yet 
by reason of the smales of the wounde, they 
come not out, nor can not co~ueniently be taken 
[^f.26v^] 
forth, then you must with muche wisdome and 
discretion amplyat & make the wounde larger, 
and if the wound be in such partes as are to be 
stitched, as the bottome of the stomake, or intestines, 
then they shalbe sowed as the Skinners 
do accustome ouer the hand, and put vppon the 
seame this pouder folowing.

And then you maye procede to the outwarde 
wounde and stiche it and let the threede 
of the inwarde wounde hange out at the outwarde 
wounde, that as inwardelye it doeth 
consolidate, so you may take awaye the threede 
and applye to the outwarde wounde this pouder 
folowynge.

Make these in pouder and vse it as is afore 
saide, & in all wounds of the inwarde parts giue 
the pacient the wounde drinke specified in the 
xiiij. Chapter of this booke. Also Clisters 
made with stipticke wynes, are merueylouslye 
commended, in lyke maner is this potage or 
brothe muche commended. 
 
Rec. Aque pluuialis vel fontane,

Let these boyle one houre then strayne it, and 
put to it these pouders folowyng, and geue the 
pacient to eate thereof .iij. or .iiij. tymes a daye 
or you maye prepare him brothe made with a 
chicken yf he be muche infebled & weake, & put 
of the foresayde pouder into it, but if Zirbus 
be wounded & corrupted, then sayth Galene, let 
the blacke & corrupted partes be bounde with a 
threde or corde, & cut away al that is so bound, & 
after the stiching of the belly, let the ends of the 
corde hange out, at y~ neither part of the wou~d. 
But if the wounde be through percing wythout 
hurte of some inwarde parte, & comminge 
forth of the same, then in this cure there are iiij. 
ententions to be obeserued. 
[^f.27v^] 
The firste is to put suche partes in their proper 
places as are come forthe. The seconde to stiche 
or sowe the wounde. The thyrde is to applye 
apt medicines. And the fourthe is, that none of 
the inward partes suffer dolor or tumor, but be 
defended from accidents. The first intention is 
brought to effect, if the wound be bigge & wide 
enough, that with softe and gentle handlyng, 
they maye be put in theyr due place. But if by 
this meanes they may not be put in, eyther for 
the strayghtnesse of the wounde, or elles because 
the partes be swollen or inflamed, then 
you muste woorke in thys maner. That 
is to saye, if the wounde be to strayte, then you 
shall enlarge it aptly with a conueninnt instrument. 
But if they maye not be put in, because 
the partes are swolne and inflated, then you 
shall labour with continuall fomentations to 
put awaye the same, whiche spryngeth for the 
more parte of the coldnesse of the ayre. Then take 
softe Sponges dipte in warme water, and foment 
the intestines, and after foment them 
with astringent Wyne, whiche is muche 
better then the water, and doth a great deale 
moore strengthen and comforte the intestines. 
The seconde intention is performed 
with softe and gentle handlinge & compressing 
the Bellye beynge certayne that the members 
without be rightly placed, then conueniently 
[^f.28r^] 
to sow and stich vp the wound according to art. 
The thyrd intention which is done by application 
of medicynes, is to lay that comfortable pouder 
on the wound whose description I showed in 
this chapter aboue. Also stufes with wine, incarnatiue 
medicines, emplasters, and other conuenient 
medicines & roling as are according to art. 
The fourth intentio~ of the cure is done with soft 
wolle wette in warme oile and lay it about the 
region of the flanks, and giue him clisters of oile 
Dille or Camomill: & also vpon the wound selfe 
to power of the same oiles & applye emplasters 
made with fenegreke, Linesede and althea. Or 
you may boile wine and salt with as much flower 
as wil suffice to make it thicke, and apply it 
as hote as he may suffer it vpon his rolling and 
ouer all the partes that suffereth payne. And 
when thys is cold then vse an other, and so do 
so many tymes vntil the dolour & paine ceaseth 
And as touching the matter if anye remayne 
within after the stiching & curing of the wound, 
there is no great regarde to be had because nature 
doth digest and resolue it: and if there be any 
multitude she sendeh it to the flankes, an 
then the cure of it, differeth not from the cure 
of other apostumes whych happen in the 
flankes.
