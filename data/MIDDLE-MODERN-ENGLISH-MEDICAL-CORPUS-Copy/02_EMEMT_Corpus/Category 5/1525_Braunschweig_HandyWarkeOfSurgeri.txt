THe skynne is a couerynge of 
the hole vnyuersall body wouen 
out of the vaynes & senewes/ 
made for the defence of 
y=e= wyttes of man/ and y=t= same 
skynne is twayne indyffere~t. The one doth 
couer the vttermost membre/ & that is named 
the very skynne/ The other couereth 
the innermost parte of the membrys and it 
is named panniculus/ or pannycle/ & that 
is as a flece/ lyke as by the selles or chambres 
of the brayne/ and pyrocraneum is y=e= 
thyn flece aboue the braynpanne/ and y=e= pa~nycle 
of the rybbes is named Pleura and 
Siphac/ and the pannycle of the harte and 
other. &c. Here after foloweth the fatnesses/ 
som is within the skynne & that is named 
grece/ som is within by y=e= bely aboute 
the kydneys and that is named talowe 
 
Tha~ cometh the flesshe whiche be in. iij. 
maners/ som is pure symple flesshe/ as is 
only the yarde and the go~mys of the tethe/ 
that other is as carnellys/ lyke the flesshe 
of the coddys & of the brest/ the iij. is co~prehendynge 
almost ouerall the hole body & 
is named caro plena lacertis. Than begynneth 
the synewes to take theyr effecte 
of the braynes & of the mary of the backe/ 
After y=t= the vaynes taketh theyr effecte of 
the lyuer and of y=e= harte. Than foloweth 
the bonys of y=e= body/ and of them be in no~bre 
.CC.xlviij. besyde y=e= small bonys that 
be called ossa cisanina and the bone laude/ 
wheron y=e= tonge is fowndyd. The nayles 
be made on the vttermost parte of y=e= me~bres 
because they sholde y=e= stronghyer grype 
and holde all maner of thynges. The 
hear is ordeyned for fayrnes and to purifye 
the manyfolde partis of the body. 
 
[}The anothomia of the composyde 
membris. Ca. ij.}] 
 
HEre begynneth of the heed/ and pryncypally 
of the braynes/ & of the pa~ne 
that kepeth y=e= braynes togyder/ for that is 
y=e= place & dwellynge of y=e= reasonable soule 
and all that is heared is namyd the panne 
of the hede/ and therin be y=e= vndersta~dynge 
membres/ & that is in the hyghest parte of 
man/ the quantyte of the braynes of mankynde 
is moche more tha~ it is of any other 
reature/ consyderynge the strength of ma~ 
agyanst the gretnes of other do~me creatu/res. 
The p~tyes of this pa~ne be .x. or .xj. 
fyrst without is the heare/ than y=e= skynne/ 
than flesshe of lacertes/ than a grosse pannycle 
or flece/ than the panne/ than w=t=in be 
ij. small fleces named dura mater/ and pia 
mater/ than the substance of the braynes/ 
and after the substance of y=e= braynes is agayne 
pia mater/ and after that/ lyath that 
meruelous netand is named Rethe mirabile/ 
& tha~ aboue that is named the fou~dacion 
of the braynes/ out of the whiche the 
senewes take theyr begynnynge. That 
panicle that is named of Galien~ pericraneum 
dothe couereth all the hole panne/ & 
is somwhat lyke to senewes/ and groweth 
of dura mater/ & of her is strongly bownde 
senewes & vaynes/ after this is craneu~ 
founde and is named the panne of the heed/ 
and that is nat a hole bone/ but .vij. bonys 
ordeyned to eche other/ and that is because 
of this/ yf one by fortune were hurt in y=e= one 
bone/ y=t= the other shulde nat be perysshed/ 
and they be gadered togyder lyke a seme or 
a thynge lyke the tethe of .ij. sawes ioyned 
in one/ to thentent that the fome of the heed 
sholde haue an yssewe. The fyrst bone of 
the panne is named coronale goynge from 
the myddest orbitarum to the twhart ioyntes 
of the panne/ and therin be hoolys of y=e= 
iyen and the out berynge of the nose/ departe 
through a lytell bone lyke a cockis combe/ 
but in y=e= women it is often founden that 
[^f.B1r^] 
the coronale is deuyded ouertwhart in the 
myddest of the forheed. The .ij. bone is 
of y=e= hynder parte/ and namyd occipiciale/ 
& is closyd through a ioynte comynge ouer 
thwarte ilyke maner of this fygure [^A figure similar to the "less than" symbol omitted.^]/ & 
is harde/ & thrugh persed/ wher as Nucha 
whiche is the mary y=t= co~mith in/ & through 
y=e= rydge bone or chyne to y=e= ende of the back 
The .iij. & .iiij. bone be in the myddys of 
sydnam & be namyd Parietales/ & be deuyded 
through a ioynt by y=e= length of y=e= pa~ne 
comynge to the bonys of y=e= eerys/ & they be 
iiij. square. The .v. & y=e= syxt bone be called 
Petrosa for theyr hardnes/ & also they be 
namyd Me~dosa/ & they be gaderyd w=t= y=e= bonys 
by y=e= sydes wher as the holys of y=e= erys 
& the clensynge of the brest be in/ & be led toward 
y=e= commyssure of the bone laude to y=e= 
myddys of the temple bonys. The .vij. 
is y=t= fundament bone namyd Basillare/ & 
is facyoned lyke a cradyll/ and supporteth 
all the forsayde bonys aboue the rose of the 
mouth/ thus ye shall vnderstande y=t= there 
be vij. maner of bonys in the pot of the heed 
whiche is all the vpperparte. thus is to be 
vndersta~de that ther be .vij. boys that kepe 
the braynes in./ yet there be other bonys y=t= 
be no pryncypallys as y=e= bone cryste which 
deuydeth the nose thryllys betwene the coronall 
bone/ & there be other bonys that be 
namyd Paria belongynge to the face/ and 
nat to the panne/ also ther be crokyd bonys 
vnder the bone of the eerys where 
as musculus is pla~ted in/ which 
opyn y=e= Iawe bonys. The lymmys 
that in the inner parte of the 
heed be holden we can nat shewe 
parfytely with y=e= Iye nor knowe 
therfore we shall deuyde y=t= brayn 
panne with a sawe roundabout y=e=

fyrst that foloweth is dura mater

THe semynalle vessellys be in

berynge the blode to the coddes/ 
bothe in the man and woma~/ wherfor 
in the last disgestyon the sede is namyd sperma/ 
whiche is the sede of our humayne nature. 
In a man these vessellys be outwardys/ 
for theyr coddys be without/ and 
the womens vesselles be within/ for theyr 
coddys or stonys be within/ and by thys 
may be marked that this sede hath the nature 
of the herte/ the lyuer/ and y=e= kydneys 
and the brayne/ for this cause/ for to make 
dilectacyon/ the senowes com from y=e= braynes 
to the stonys/ & also the hole body hath 
felowshyp therwith. The matrix or moder 
is an acker of the generacyon of mankynd/

She hath also collygacyon with the braynes/

holownessys of the fyrste shynne bone namyd 
Os focile/ and theron is a rou~d brode

and so is the knee full made. Than foloweth 
the shynne bone/ and ther be .ii. bonis 
namyd focilia/ y=e= byggest in y=e= former syde

The other on the vtter syde lyke wyse desce~dynge

betwene them bothe one holownes/ where 
as the fyrst bone of the fote is receyued in. 
And in y=e= fote be .iii. acyes or gaderynge of

In the other roundnes is festyned 
the holownes of the bone namyd Nauicularis. 
Than folowed incontynent vpon 
the fote the bone named Cahab. The bone 
Nauicularis is lyke a shypholow on both
