BEfore I enter into this discourse, I 
thought it best friendly Reader, in a word 
or two to make cleere and plaine vnto you 
since the publishing of this my booke of obseruations, 
and also the other of Lues Venerea, 
vpon some speciall occasions, I haue 
againe examined and diligently perused 
them, & farther considering, that whilest a 
man liueth, any thing that is amisse may 
be amended: I haue therfore in some sort 
altered and corrected these two books, and 
so haue ioyned them both togither in one, and many things I haue left 
out as needlesse againe to be spoken of, also I haue enlarged these two 
bookes with new obseruations and approoued remedies before wanting, 
the which doth as it were greatly inrich the same. And for that I would 
be loth to obscure and hide the thing which may do good, I haue therefore 
heere set them out to publike view of indifferent iudges, the which 
worke (as I take it) is most needfull and necessarie for this present troublesome 
time, and may very easily be vnderstood of any Surgeon, who 
hath as it were but a taste or smack of any learning at all, as who so wil 
vouchsafe at their conuenient leisure to bestowe the perusing and diligent 
reading thereof, I doubt not but they will thinke their labors and 
time well bestowed. And thus hitherto hauing very briefly declared 
the causes of this last publication, I will heere spend no further time, nor 
vse any other preambulations, but presently enter into the first beginning 
of this booke, with the very same matter and words in substance 
and meaning, as in some sort is contained in my former writings. 
 
[^p.2^] 
IT happened in Anno 1577. two Gentlemen 
were drying Gun powder in a brasse pan, who 
(as it did appeere) had no consideration vnto the 
ouer heating of the pan, but without knowledge 
of the danger, and care of themselues did continually 
stir the powder with their hands:It chanced 
so, that the powder vpon a sudden fired, wherwith 
they were most greeuously burned, both 
hands and face, with their bodies and clothes, which caused them to 
make a most lamentable crying: and being heard of diuers in the same 
house, who perceiuing their chamber to be in a great smoke & smell of 
Gun powder, presently entred in, & with all haste that possible might 
be, caried the persons burned into an other roome, where they foorthwith 
did cut, rend, & teare off al their clothes fro~ their bodies: otherwise without 
their helpes, no question but they had beene burned to death. There 
dwelled neere vnto them a gentlewoman, by whom they were greatlie 
eased with a whey which she made of veriuice and milke: neuerthelesse 
she was fearfull to proceede any further, for that she neuer had seene the 
experience in the curing of such great burnings with Gun powder, 
neither could hir stomack well digest the sight and filthy sauors thereof: 
whereupon I was presently sent for, and after diligent view had, I did 
first annoint the parts that were scorched and blistered oftentimes, specially 
their hands and face, with this remedy following, whereby the 
parts afflicted were preserued from blistering.

But where the skin was cleane burned off, and the parts made thereby 
raw and painfull, then I did apply onely this vnguent, the which I 
haue many times approoued in diuers cures, with good successe vnto 
those that haue beene so burned with Gun powder, which medicine was 
neuer altered nor changed till the parts were perfectly made whole, 
without any further helpes.

[}Now heere followeth certaine remedies, good for 
burnings with Gun powder. Cap. 2.}] 
 
IT is requisite to be obserued and noted, that in any wise 
you attempt not to cut or open any of the blisters of 
them that be so burned with the flame of the gun powder, 
which at the first will cause intolerable paine, being 
annointed as aforesaid with the same remedies of Salis 
com. & succi cæparum, or such like as followeth: But 
[^p.4^] 
note this alwaies, that if the inflammation do so increase, that the humors 
vnder the blistered skin, do corrode and vlcerate the flesh, then you 
must in any wise cut the blisters, to giue passage vnto those painfull humors.

Not long since, there was a man burned with gun powder, especially 
on the backside of his right hand, & also his arme euen vp to his elbow, in 
very grieuous sort, that the skin on the backside of his hand was cleane 
burnt, & his arme also scorched, and blisters did presently rise in diuers 
places: Then with all speede there was a Surgeon sent for, that did 
dwell neere vnto him, who hauing intelligence by the messenger of this 
mishap, he presently furnished himselfe with the aboue named Mel saponis, 
who at his comming to visite his patient, finding him in great extremitie 
of paines & burning heat, did then, with all speede addresse himselfe 
for the cure of the patient, & he spred of the saide Mel saponis, vpon 
browne paper, and then laide it ouer all the greeued parts, aswell vnto 
the rawe and tender places where the skin was cleane burned off, as 
also vnto the parts, which were but scorched and blistered: and thus supposing 
he had done well, notwithstanding the patients paines exceeded, 
he continued his former course of dressing from Thursday in the afternoone, 
vntill Saterday next following in the morning, all which time 
& space his paines were exceeding intolerable: then at the last the Surgeon 
himselfe was amazed, and knew not what to do, but very early in 
the morning he came vnto me, and desired my counsell and helpe, and 
acquainted me with the cause of his comming, which was, that I should 
bring with me, such remedies, as would speedily ease his patient, of the 
extremitie of his paines, for he confessed that it was a cure which himselfe 
had seene little experience of: So in regarde of his curtesie, and also 
being very desirous of knowledge in the Art, the which causes the rather 
induced me to leaue off all mine owne busines for that time, 
I went with him: and after my comming to the patient, perceiuing 
indeed his paines and greefe to be most lamentable, as it appeered by his 
heauie countenance, so that I feared his graue would haue swallowed 
him vp: but after I had diligently viewed the maner of his burning, 
and did farther behold how disorderly he had been delt with, I secretly 
conferred with the Surgeon, and told him he had not done well, in the 
applying of his Mel saponis in all places alike, for I said, although it be 
a medicine of ancient experience with some, and many times vsed as 
[^p.5^] 
they say with great profit, chiefly to keepe the parts that are burned 
and scorched from blistering, which is a most excellent thing so to do, 
yet it is a thing not meete to be vsed vpon the tender and rawe places: 
for by that meanes you do adde paines vnto paines, and heat vnto heat, 
or as it were fire vnto fire, like vnto him which did set his house on fire, 
and to quench it againe, did cast vpon it two or three barrels of gun powder. 
For which cause I haue heere set downe this note or obseruation, 
onely as a forewarning vnto others for committing the like fault and 
offence. To proceede, he was presently let bloud, and I did after take 
Aqua Ranarum & lactis vaccinæ ana. q. s. being mixed togither, and a 
little warmed, then we did wash and bathe the parts almost halfe an 
houre togither with cleane linnen clothes, and thus we continued three 
times a day, and three times a night during the time of his great extremitie 
of paines: after which bathing, then we did wring out the saide 
linnen clothes, and on the same was spred of my forenamed Unguent, 
for burnings with gun powder, as it is now published in this booke. 
So that by this maner and order of dressing aforesaid, which was continued 
till the extremitie of his paines, and burning heat was well qualified, 
I say within the space of sixteene daies, he was made whole by 
these cooling remedies, which did quench the firie heat of his great 
burning, onely now and then I did applie of Emp. diachalcitheos +o. iiij. 
and I relented it, and then added vnto the Emp. diachalcitheos in the 
cooling, Vnguenti Albi Camphorati +o. j. +s. and vsed no other meanes 
vnto the ende of the cure: neuerthelesse there was left behinde an vnseemely 
cicatrice, by reason of the ill handling at the first, which after by 
no meanes possible coulde be preuented or amended: then I tolde the 
yoong man, he had serued an ill saint, which did not learne him to know 
any better the nature and propertie of his medicines: he answered me 
againe, his knowledge was iust of his masters pitch: then I spake little 
to him, but willed him to be more diligent in reading of good authors, 
and heereafter to be carefull how he applied his medicines.

[}The true maner and order of the curing a marchant of this 
citie of London, called M. Thomas Gore, which 
was wounded with Gun shot in the 
towne of Vlushing. 
Cap. 3.}] 
 
A Fewe yeeres past a marchant of good account, in this citie of London, 
called M. Thomas Gore, being in Ulushing in Zealand, there 
[^p.7^] 
making great sute vnto the prince of Orenge and the States, for the 
release of a ship and goods of his, and his friends, which the Ulushingers 
had taken at sea: in the time of that sute, he did stande at a doore where 
his lodging was, beholding a band of Dutch soldiers as they were 
marching to the wals: and as it is in townes of war the maner of some 
soldiers in a brauery to discharge their peeces as they passe by, so one of 
the soldiers that certainly knew him, and the cause of his comming to 
the towne, maliciously as the marchant himselfe confessed, hauing his 
peece charged with a bullet, suddenly shot at him, both his hands being 
clasped togither, and the bullet missing his bodie passed through the 
middle of both his hands, and fractured the bones, and also wounded 
him through the vpper part of his left arme, and also perced and fractured 
that bone in many peeces: which bullet also did rend and teare the 
muscles, sinewes, vaines, and arteries, by reason hereof, there followed 
great paines, inflations and tumors, which continued a long time, notwithstanding 
he was presently preserued and drest by the Surgeons of 
the towne of Ulushing: but he saide he receiued by them small hope or 
comfort of his recouery, notwithstanding I know they were excellent 
men: Then his friends being gentlemen and marchants of London, 
were by him giuen to vnderstand that he was still from day to day 
woorse and woorse, for which cause they sent for him to London, and presently 
vpon his arriuall, I was brought vnto this cure, and after conference 
had with a doctor a Physicke for his diet, purging and bleeding, I 
made ready foorthwith this cataplasma, which appeased the paines and 
ceased the inflammation.

Powder that which is to be powdred, and mixe all these togither, 
stirring it continually till it come to perfection. Notwithstanding I had 
very great helpe by this mundificatiue, and the powder of Mercurii 
præcipitati, yet I was after constrained to vse more stronger remedies: 
and amongst others I found most profit in this powder following, 
which did not onely take away the euil flesh, but also did remooue diuers 
fragments and peeces of broken bones, which were not fully loosed from 
the paniculous parts, and also hidden inthe spungious flesh, neuerthelesse 
it worketh not without paine, therefore in such causes, if possible it 
may be, it is better to let nature separate the bones, than to take them 
away by force and violence.

Likewise I commonly vsed Emplastrum Diachalcitheos published

flesh, and mundified the wounds, and also remooued the loose bones, then 
next I vsed my Vnguentum incarnatiuum, whereunto sometimes I 
did mixe Aluminis combust, in Aceto Ros. which vnguent did not only 
drie vp superfluous moisture, but did moreouer gently cleanse without 
[^p.9^] 
any great mordication or biting: which being performed, then I did 
shortly after desiccate and dry vp the said wounds with Vnguentum 
desiccatiuum and Emplastrum diachalcitheos, and thus I performed 
this worke and cured him perfectly within this citie of London. 
 
[}The cure of one master Andrew Fones a marchant of London, 
who being in a ship at the sea was set vpon by the 
Vlushingers, in which fight he was very 
dangerously wounded with Gun 
shot. Cap. 4.}] 
 
THis Marchants ship was set vpon by certaine Vlushingers 
at sea, and being a long time in fight with them, 
and very sore oppressed by the number of men, and ships: 
yet they did fight it out, vntil at the last by chance he was 
shot into the vpper part of his brest neere vnto Os furculæ, 
or the channell bone, and so passed through till it 
came to the lower part of Os scapulæ, or the shoulder blade, where it did 
rest till he came to London, which was a long time: for immediately 
after his hurt, the ship was taken and carried into Vlushing, where he 
was in cure (as he said to me and many others) a long time with two 
of the Prince of Orenges Chirurgions, to his great cost and charges, 
yet it profited nothing. Then I was sent for, and after speeches had, I 
prepared my selfe, and foorthwith made probation and found where the 
shot was secretly lodged: then I did without tarience, in the presence 
of diuers skilfull Chirurgions of London, make reasonable deepe and 
large incision, and there I did take out the shot, and after that there 
was great care had of him by his friends, for that I did giue them to vnderstand 
that the wound was not without danger. Then they ioined 
with me one of hir Maiesties Phisitions, who directed him to take Arce~us 
Apozema, which certainly did worke most excellently wel, the proofe 
thereof I neuer had seene vntill that time, but many times since I haue 
vsed it, and I haue found thereof a treasure for the curing of wounds in 
the brest, which composition I will here set downe for the woorthinesse 
thereof, as it was ministerd to him. But first after I had taken out the 
shot, I preserued the wound with this digestiue, the which I vsed vpon 
tents and pledgets.

[}The cure of a certaine soldier that was wounded with Gun shot 
in the Low countries: he was shot in at the bottom of his belly 
on the left side, and the bullet passed through, and rested in the 
right buttock neere vnto Anus, where it lay secretly hid, 
and could not be found for the space of three 
yeeres, in which time it became a 
Fistula of a hard curation. 
Cap. 5.}] 
 
IN the yeere of our Lord 1573. I was sent for, vnto my 
singular good friend Master Richard Yoong, one of hir 
Maiesties Iustices of peace for Middlesex, who did earnestly 
request me, that I would for his sake, cure and 
heale, if it were possible, the aforesaid soldier, called M. 
Giles, for that he was knowen to be a very valiant man, 
which cure to performe, seemed to me very hard and difficult, for that he 
had been for the space of three yeeres, with diuers very good Surgeons, 
both beyond the seas as also in England, and yet his griefe did still reuerse, 
and breake out againe: the reason I perceiued was, for that the 
place, where the bullet lay, could neither by probation, nor coniecture be 
certainly knowen, and that was the chiefest cause I suppose, why they 
failed in this cure: so at this Gentlemans request, I did take him in 
cure, and after due consideration and search made, with probes of Lead, 
and waxe candles, and long and small flexible tents, that were apt to 
yeeld to euery crooked turning, yet by no meanes I could come to the 
knowledge or vnderstanding where the bullet had conuaied and hid it 
selfe, neither could the patient himselfe giue me any certaine direction 
[^p.13^] 
thereof: then first of all I enlarged the mouth or orifice of the fistula, 
with a tent made of a spoonge, and for that the callous hollownes did 
penetrate deepe, and (as I haue said) being vncertaine of the bottome, 
which was in the part where the bullet lay: Therefore I ordained a 
long and small stiffe tent made of fine lint without any grosse threds in 
it, and so with the white of an egge well beaten, I framed my tent in 
length and bignes, according to the greatnes and smalnes of the griefe: 
which being thus prepared according to art, then I did annoint euery 
tent slightly ouer, with Vnguentum Rosarum, onely to haue the powders 
cleaue fast, and take better hold on the tents, wherby it might be so 
conueied in, to remooue and destroy the callous hardnes, which was inuironed 
about the circuits or compasse of the hollownes of the fistula, 
and the first powder that I vsed for this purpose, was the powder which 
I haue published in the third Chapter of this booke, pag. 8. After I had 
reasonably well enlarged the fistula with the foresaid powder, which I 
vsed twise a weeke: and alwaies I remooued the scars with vnguentum 
rosarum, and laid vpon the same most commonly Emplastrum Diachalcitheos dissolued with oile of roses, and Rose vineger, and the whites of 
egs, being mixed well togither, and so I applied it: and although I had 
herewith partly taken away the callous matter, yet I found not that 
profit and commoditie as heretofore I had done, in the curing of diuers 
other. Then hauing full hope of better successe with this strong powder 
next following, the which I applied after the same maner and order as 
the other aforesaid.

With this powder I did wholy destroy the callous matter, so far as it 
was possible to conuey in my tents. Then I supposed that I had made 
sufficient proofe to haue found where the bullet rested, but do what I 
could by searching, either whe~ he stood vpright, or stowped downwards, 
or as he stood when he was shot, the which he did so neere as he could direct 
me: all this profited nothing, till at the last I did consider that such 
Fistulas that hath mo creekes or turnings than one, could hardly be cured 
by tents. Wherefore I followed the counsell of Tagaltius, who saith 
in the cure of Fistulas, where medicine by tents cannot be brought, or 
conueied into the bottom as the cause doth require: then to vse iniections 
and liquors meet for the purpose, to be cast in with a syring, is (saith 
he) greatly auailable, as I very well did prooue by this cure: for I prepared 
[^p.14^] 
this water following, the which I did cast in with a syring that 
had a long pipe and a large barrell: the said water is called aquæ fallopii.

Put al these togither in a double glasse, and boile it in Balneo mariæ, 
to the consumption of the fourth part. After I had cast in of this water, 
presently I stopped the mouth or orifice of the Fistula, to this end and 
purpose that thereby the skin might also become the more thin, by reason 
of the long lying in of the iniection, and store of matter which was 
gathered within the cauity or bottom of the Fistula. And (as I said) caused 
him foorthwith to lie downe vpon his right buttock, according as the 
passage directed me, onely that the water should not returne back again 
till it had wrought his effect, for within xiiij. houres after he did greatly 
complaine of extreme paine in his right buttocke neere vnto Anus, and 
there I did perceiue it to be greatly tumified and swolne, then I applied 
on the outside of his buttocke where he complained a Cataplasma, 
which is singular good in such causes. The composition is as followeth,

Thus I let him remaine till the next day following in the morning, 
for then I had good hope that the water had found the passage and place 
where the bullet had seated it selfe, then I called others in presence 
when I made incision vpon the right buttock neere vnto Anus, where 
the swelling shewed it selfe. There I made incision, and did take out the 
shot, and for that time to mitigate the paine, I iniected new milke and 
Suger with a little oile of Roses, and vpon pledgets I applied Vnguentum 
[^p.15^] 
rosarum, to remooue the eschars which were made by the foresaide 
water, and I staied the bleeding which followed after the incision with 
Galens powder: and so he rested reasonable quiet all that day and the 
next night: then at the second dressing I ordained this vnguent, the 
which I vsed till the paines and inflammation were ceased, and the said 
vnguent is made of Axungiæ porcinæ & oculi populei, q. s. wherewith 
[/26./] 
I mixed a small quantitie of Mercurij præcipitati, then after I did

[^p.16^] 
[}A very hard and dangerous cure which happened to a common 
soldier called Iohn Searle, by a shot with a Musket bullet, 
through the ioint of his shoulder on his right 
arme, which fractured a great part of 
the said ioint into many 
peeces. Cap. 6.}] 
 
A Few yeeres past, there was sent vnto me by M. Marre a 
gentleman attending vpo~ general Norrice, who not long 
before I cured of a wound in his hand, I say he sent vnto 
me by his man a certaine soldier called Iohn Searle, being 
in the flower of his age (about some six and twentie 
yeeres) and of a reasonable good constitution of body, who 
was shot through the ioint of his right shoulder with a musket bullet, 
so that a great part of the bones of the said ioint were battered and broken 
into many peeces, with the force of the bullet: It was said, he receiued 
this wound at the siege of Grane, he seruing then vnder the conducting 
and leading of Generall Norrice, being there cheefe commander of 
the English regiment, at which time the Generall himselfe was wounded 
on the brest with a pike, and escaped his life most dangerously, he 
was then also thrust into the mouth and throte with a pike, so that two 
of his foremost teeth were fractured & broken in peeces with the force of 
the pike, whom I cured in the Low Countries. (As I haue before said) 
at the earnest request of M. Marre I diligently viewed and searched 
the aboue named soldier his greefe, which for want of orderly preseruing 
and dressing, and good looking vnto: and moreouer lacke of abilitie 
to pay for the curing of so great & dangerous a greefe, was like to haue 
perished: by reason therof his wound was in time ouergrown with corrupt 
and spungious flesh: the humors also were continually fleeting, corrupt, 
and of a stinking sauor, the whole ioint was maruellously swolne, 
and sore oppressed with very great paine: by reason of the humors that 
were gathered about the ioint, being vehemently heated, and full of 
rancor and malice, which proceeded partly of those causes afore declared, 
and also of the causes after following: moreouer, his arme from the 
shoulder, and so downe vnto his hande was vnmeasurably swolne, the 
skin indurate and hard, so that he had smal feeling of that arme, but with 
a dull sense: and also his arme was vnweldy and heauy: the orifices of 
the said wound were very small, and almost closed vp togither. After I 
perceiued all these pernitious signes and accidents, wherewith the 
[^p.17^] 
whole member was assailed, and which to my iudgement threatened 
great dangere, whereby I doubted it would prooue but a sorrowful cure, 
yet for that he was a man of a valiant and stout courage, and farther 
calling to minde the wise sayings of Iosephus Quercetanus, a man as it 
may appeere, liuing in the light of all good learning, he declareth in the 
second chapter of his booke of curing Gun shot: That he would not 
haue the wounded patient forsaken as a dead man, although the wound 
seeme dangerous and mortall, but with all diligence to apply meete 
and conuenient medicines, For saith he, "many times nature being holpen 
[/29./] 
by Art, worketh myracles, whereby empericks to the great infamy 
of Physicke oftentimes purchase fame, for being bold vpon the 
strength of nature, they take in hand desperate cures, forsaken as dead 
men by the Physitions, and get thereby to themselues great credite, & to 
the Physitions no lesse shame, as by heare-say about two yeeres past it 
hapned to a noble prouinciall named Vnissius, who being in the kings armie 
against Rupella, was by a shot pearced through, & forsaken of the physitions, 
who iudged the substance of his liuer to be perished, and yet was 
cured by some of his noble freends with medicines of no great price: 
The which rare euent, may be a notable example of the strange effects 
of nature, which oftentimes deceiueth the iudgement of most learned 
Physitions, whom I would wish neuer to be destitute of singular remedies 
against desperate and hainous greefes, &c". 
 
Heereby may be perceiued that famous men of all former ages, vntill 
this day reprooue all those Physitions and Surgeons in like sort, 
which at any time refuse to helpe and succor their wounded patients, 
though the wound seeme deadly and dangerous: for if he happen to die 
for want of all helpe, we may iustly saith Guido, be accounted and taken 
for most wicked and vncharitable persons: And so I will heere leaue to 
speake any farther of this matter, for that my onely meaning is heere to 
instruct yoong practizers, and not otherwise to discourse, as I haue before 
said, I hauing a carefull foresight, and being very desirous to do all 
the good I could vnto this poore man, and also loth to prolong and abuse 
the time, as that vilde slander goeth vpon Surgeons generally, but 
chiefly of the Surgeons of London vndeserued, amongst whom I know 
there are many which are woorthy to be recorded in the number of most 
excellent famous men: whereof I could speake more largely, but that 
this place serueth not to declare by-matters, and therefore to proceede 
vnto the end. Therefore with all diligence I did make probation, 
and searched the said wound, which done, I did foorthwith fortifie, 
strengthen and defend the weake parts, by applying about the ioint repelling 
medicines, to the intent to staie the streame, and intercept the 
[^p.18^] 
flux of humors that was stirred vp, partly by often searching, and also 
by sharpe and biting medicines as followeth, which of very necessitie 
must needes be done, then I indeuored my selfe to enlarge the orifices of 
the said wound, and to subdue the corrupt and spungeous flesh, which 
was performed with great care and diligence: first I made a long tent, 
the which I armed with the common causticke, made vnguent wise, 
and so I conueied it into the farthest part of the wound, so far as it was 
possible, at that present time to go. The strange euent of the said ruptury 
or causticke is not onely in this cure, but in many others greatly to 
be esteemed: thus after the orifices of the said wound were sufficiently 
enlarged for the time present, then to appease the paines and heat that 
were greatly increased by the often vsing againe and againe of sharpe 
and biting medicines, which was done to this end and purpose, to discouer 
the things infixed which a long time had been hidden within the 
said ioint, as followeth, first to remooue the eschars aforesaid, and to 
digest the humors, I applied vpon tents and dossels, Vnguentum populeon 
simplex sometimes mixed with Mercurij precipitati q. s. next 
thereunto I applied a plaister of Diachalcitheos, dissolued with oile of 
Roses, and the iuice of Housleeke, and Plantaine, ana. q. s. and so to couer 
ouer all the ioint of the arme downe to the hand: this Cataplasma 
whose cooling facultie exceedeth in restraining the inflammation, and also 
to mittigate the paine.

Mingle all these togither, and make a Cataplasma according to art. 
Thus as I haue said, I continued from time to time, till the extreme 
paines were somwhat asswaged, and the weake member a little strengthened, 
which by long infirmitie and ill looking vnto, was greatly feebled, 
for these causes I did many times forbeare the often vsing of forcible 
and strong medicines, knowing indeede that the best way of curing, 
is if it be possible, to cure quickly and without paine, or as little as may 
be. But after his paines and swelling were somewhat taken away, 
partly by the foresaid Catasplasma, and partly by a plaister of Demineo, 
[^p.19^] 
made with the oiles of neates seete and lineseede, of equall portions, &c. 
But it is furthermore to be noted, that first of all he was purged by the 
counsell of a physition, and then next I did foment all the parts round 
about his ioint, and so likewise downe his arme to his hand with a fomentation, 
which I made of malusey, vineger, and oile of roses ana. q. s. 
Whereby the pores of the skin, were the better opened, that the humors 
might the easilier breath foorth, and be resolued: which done, I 
went about the more boldly to subdue and take away the superfluous 
and spungious flesh, whereby the corruption being inclosed, had the freeer 
passage. The which was done sometimes with Mercurij præcipitati 
alone, and sometimes I mixed with Mercurij præcipitati Vitriolium, of 
ech equall portions, or rather lesse of the Vitriall than of the Præcipitat. 
and sometimes I vsed Vitriolium album & Bole Armoniacum made 
in very fine powder, as it is described in the viij. Chapter of this booke, 
for the cure of a fistula: also I did vse at sundrie times Vnguentum Ægyptiacum 
after Auicen, whose properties exceede in subduing spungious 
flesh, and in scaling corrupt bones: in like maner I vsed many 
times the trochies of Deminio after Vigo: but in conclusion, the chiefest 
thing that finished and perfected this cure, was a tent made onely of the 
powder of Vitriall and Bole, as it is described in the Chapter aboue said, 
the which I made in length and greatnes vnto the concauitie of the greeued 
part, by meanes hereof, as it were by a miraculous operation, happily 
there was stirred vp aboue Os furculæ, and a little below the orifice 
of the wound in the corrupt ioint a rotten abscisse, wherin was compact 
a masse of most horrible filthie stinking matter with, certaine peeces 
of foule blacke & rotten bones, & peeces of the bullet of Lead, with a peece 
of iron of his armour: then after I had thus wholy displaced and taken 
away all these annoiances, which was done, as I haue afore said, with 
the often visiting of the wound with eating and consuming medicines, 
as he was able to beare and endure it, by meanes hereof he was deliuered 
from all perils whatsoeuer, which a long time lay pend and lurking 
within the said ioint, they conspiring much hurt and danger not onely 
vnto the weake member, but also vnto the whole state of his bodie. And 
here I end this briefe note or obseruation, without farther repetition, 
onely I say after the wound was deliuered from all perils whatsoeuer, 
then the rest of the cure was accomplished according to the generall 
method of other co~mon wounds, as with mundificatiues, incarnatiues, 
and consolidatiues, &c. published in this booke in diuers places: thus by 
carefull handling, and the benefit of nature he was cured of this dangerous 
wound, yet he remaineth still lame of that arme, and will be so 
all the daies of his life.

chin, and carried away a good part of the Manduble and 
the teeth withall: moreouer, it did rend his hand 
greatly: all which I cured without 
maine or deformitie. 
Cap. 7}] 
 
After I had searched the wound of his hand and face, then I preserued 
those wounds with oile of Hypericon warmed, and vpon 
the same to restraine the bleeding I applied this restrictiue,

And the wounds of the hand were defended from dangerous accidents, 
which commonly follow such wounds, and will admit no cure till 
they be remooued by good industrie and diligence, which was performed 
with that defensiue, which is published in Cap 4. pag. 10. 
 
Then with decent bolstering and rowling I preserued his hand for 
the first dressing, laying it orderly vpon a palmestrie of wood, well wrapped 
with fine towe, and then I did binde it very easily, so that his hand 
might safely lie on it without stirring, or remoouing any way, then 
after the wound of his lip was also stitched. I vsed vnto the wound of 
the outward part, the oile of Hypericon well warmed, which I applied 
to with pledgets of fine lint dipped in the same oile, and vpon the saide 
pledgets I laid also the aboue named restrictiue plaister wise, and often 
dressed the wound in the inside of his mouth, with Sirup. ros. & mel. ros. 
and also very often with this Gargarisme following,

And thus with bolstering the wound of his chin and conuenient 
rowling, it rested till the second day. Then at the next preseruation I 
ordained steuphs of white wine and Aqua vitæ, ana. q. s. and also Vnguentum 
de peto or Nicotion, which I vsed continually with the oile of 
Hypecicon warmed, & the plaister of Diachalcitheos, and annointing 
the parts about with oile of Roses, and so this wound of his chin was 
in a short time perfectly cured: in like maner I prepared at the first for 
the curing of his hand also steuphs of white wine with Aqua vitæ: and 
I ordained likewise this digestiue, wherwith I continued vntill these 
wounds did yeeld perfect matter: in which time no accident followed 
that did any way hinder the ordinarie course of curing.

A conuenient digestiue in such wounds is necessary bicause of the alteration 
of the aire, and for brusing and renting of the parts so disseuered: 
howbeit, digestiues may not be vsed ouer long, for then they will 
certainly too much putrifie the parts. Moreouer, I vsed in the time of 
application of this digestiue, Oleum lumbricorum, & Oleum hypericonis, 
of each equall portions, and twise a day I dipped the pledgets of 
the digestiue in those foresaid oiles, & I annointed the part round about 
the wound with warme oile of Roses, and a plaister of Diachalcitheos 
dissolued in oile of Roses, with vineger & the white of an egge being wel 
incorporated togither, and so I continued with bolstering and rowling 
till the wound was well digested. Then I did mundifie these woundes 
of his hand with this mundificatiue, which maister Rassius, one of the 
French kings Surgeons did giue vnto me, and it is singular good in 
such wounds, as I haue many times approoued.

Now heere I will drawe to the end and full finishing of this cure, the 
which I performed within this city of London: at the same very instant 
[/35./] 
time, I cured one Henry Battey, a Cheesemonger, dwelling at Broken 
Warfe, which by ouercharging of his Dag, it did breake into many 
peeces, and the breech or screw of the Dag did mount or flie vp into the 
corner of his eie, and fractured the bone, and so passed vp into his head, 
and the wound presentlie was shut vp and closed togither: insomuch 
that those surgeons which the~ had him in cure before I was called, supposed 
the wound to be very small & of no account, and indeed went about 
to heale it vp: but still he did grow weaker and weaker, insomuch the 
Bell towled for him: then I was sent for, and to be short, foorthwith I 
enlarged the wound by incision, and I tooke out the screw of the Dag 
out of his head, and the peeces of the fractured bones, which were caried 
in with the said screw: to conclude, in a very short time after I cured 
him within this citie of London, and he liueth vnto this day.

IT is many times seen by experience frienly Reader, that of wounds 
receiued in the wars, do grow a number of such intricate Fistulas 
of very hard curation, and many of them are so inuironed with 
such a tough hard callous substance, with corruption of the bones in 
diuers parts of the body, that they are giuen ouer and forsaken of very 
[^p.23^] 
good Surgeons, as past all helpe or hope of any recouerie: and now 
here I giue you to vnderstand that in the yeere 1591. the xii. of Ianuary, 
there was sent vnto me from Captaine Fleming, a certaine 
soldier which had a fistulas vlcer in his thigh, with the hurt and corruption 
of the bone, being fiue inches aboue the ioint of his knee on his right 
leg, but before I speake any further of this matter, or of the maner of his 
curing, I will first a little discourse of the originall beginning, and chiefe 
cause of the saide fistula, and of the great danger he with others escaped 
in the time of their voyage. You shall here note, that after I had reasoned 
with this patient, he reported vnto me that the first beginning and 
cause of this fistula in his thigh, was by a wound with an arrow, made 
of a smal cane or reed, hauing a flint head, very curiously fastened on, and 
feathered with two long parrots feathers, or some such like, which the 
wilde sauage people of Brasile, and the countries neere thereunto adioining, 
do often poison with the iuice of an herbe, and vseth them as 
their cheefest weapons of defence, as I haue before declared. This soldier 
being vpon the coast of Brasile in a man of war, a ship of the west countrey, 
who a long time had been sailing vpon the seas, and ouerdriuen 
with very foule weather, and hauing extreme neede of fresh water and 
victuals, insomuch that they were constrained vpon great occasion, to 
send their bote ashore early in the morning, and manned their bote 
with certaine shot, and other weapons of war: they being come ashore, 
there were certaine appointed of their company to staie behinde with 
the bote to fill water, and the rest trauelled vp into the countrey to see 
what they could meete with to supply their wants: it was said they had 
not iournied very far, but they had discouered a certaine number of sauage 
wilde naked people, of whom at the first they made no reckoning 
or account of at all, bicause they seemed to be afraid, and so did flie away, 
and now and then staying, onely (as it was farther reported) they did it 
but to allure and draw forward on our men neerer vnto the rest of their 
force and strength, which lay in ambush for them, who nothing suspecting 
that they did it to betraie our men, till at the last (as he said) 
they had espied the rest of their company, which were gathered togither 
in a troupe in a very short space: then our men being some fortie fiue 
made a stande: neuerthelesse, those wilde people being aboue two or 
three hundred, very fiercely with a certaine noise or crie, charged our 
men with their arrowes and darts, &c. But our men withstood them at 
the first very manfully, and did hurt and kill many of them with their 
shot and other weapons: their number still increased with fresh wilde 
people, so that thereby our men perceiuing their number to be too great 
for them any longer to incounter withall, which fight was continued a 
[^p.24^] 
long time, at the last our men were constrained to retire, in which retrait 
some were slaine, some hurt, and some taken, and could neuer be 
heard of againe: thus with much adoo the rest escaped and recouered 
their bote, which happily rescued our men, by reason the saide bote had 
certaine small peeces of ordinance in the head of it, which often they shot 
off, and so constrained those wilde people to retire back again, or else our 
men had vtterly been ouerthrowne, so they went aboord their ship with 
their fresh water, and presently they called for the surgeon of their ship 
to dresse their hurt men, for that some of them that were sore wounded 
with arrowes, and darts, were in very great paines and burning heat, 
and shortly after, a maruellous inclination to vomiting, and much 
vaine and idle talke. Moreouer, the colour of their skin about their 
wounds was somwhat swartish, which accident appeered not vntil the 
second day after they receiued their hurts, but vpon none so much as 
vpon this soldier, which after had the fistula in his thigh: so in the end 
some were cured, some died shortly after, and some by no meanes possible 
could be healed during all the time they were at sea, neither could 
their wounds be brought to any good digested matter, the reason as I 
gathered was, that they were touched with the scuruie. To proceed, the 
surgeon of their ship, being as they said a man of a fine skil, and one that 
had great experience for the curing of such poisoned wounds, by reason 
he had trauelled diuers times into those countries, and did know very 
well that their maner was to poison their arrowes, and therefore he did 
at the very first with great care, make large and deepe incision, for that 
the breach that was made with the arrow was but little in compasse, 
though deepe vnto the bone: and for that cause after incision was made, 
he did presently fill the wound with hot Ægyptiacum, and vpon it a 
plaister of fine Triackle, and so drest him vp very orderly as it was reported. 
As for the rest that were wounded, I meane not heere to speake 
any further of them at all: also to defend the hart and other parts inwardly 
from venome and poison, he gaue this soldier amongst the rest, 
to eat a certaine preseruatiue, but what that was, I could not gather by 
his speech. But to omit here to speake farther of preseruatiues inwardly, 
I haue thought it very expedient to make knowne vnto the friendly 
Reader, that at what time soeuer yee shall happen vpon the like cures 
of poisoned wounds, that you do not forget first to scarifie the edges of 
the wound, according as it is noted in the 12. Chapter following, to the 
intent to make the wound bleede the better, for that much poison is euacuated 
with the blood, and you must be very mindfull in all your incisions 
vnto the vaines and arteries, whereby may insue too immoderate 
profusion of blood. Then after you haue made scarification, yee shall 
[^p.25^] 
presently set on a strong cupping glasse, the better to draw out the venome 
and poison, and then in the steed of the hot Ægyptiacum, which no 
doubt is very good, I thinke it likewise profitable to make triall of this 
excellent remedie heere following, which although I haue neuer experienced 
my selfe, nor sawe it practised by others, yet it is commended to 
me by men of skill, and it standeth with great reason, and is already 
published by Iohanes Franciscus Rota. in his booke De tormentorum 
Vulneribus. 
 
[/36./] 
+R Lixinii saponarii lib. +s.

Mixe all these togither, and put them in an earthen pot, or vessel well 
glased, and let it macerate in the sun by the space of twentie daies, then 
when you will vse of this medicine dip your pledgets, runlets or tents 
therein, and fill the wound accordingly, and this do till the third day. 
To proceede, it is furthermore to be remembred, that after this soldier 
and the rest of his company departed from the coast of Brasile, and so for 
England, they were a long time after vpon the seas, and indured maruellous 
stormes and tempests, and much adoo they had to bring home 
their ship, and recouer the coast of England, in which time many of 
their men fell sicke of the scuruie, so that by reason thereof, and the causes 
afore spoken, that of fower score and twelue men, they had not eight 
and twentie strong and able persons to bring home the ship: But after 
this soldier came a shore, and landed in the west Countrey, being sicke 
of the scuruie, and very ill troubled with his wounde, immediately he 
was taken in cure, and continued so sixteene weekes, in all which time 
and space he was nothing the better of his wound: onely he was cured 
of the scuruie: of which disease or infection, I meane breefly to speake 
in the 12. Chapter of this booke: and now to say in a word for the cure, 
of this fistula, yee shall note, after he had shewed it vnto me, I founde 
there a very straight and narrow orifice, with foule, hard and callous 
lips: the humors that flowed were sanious and glutinous, with corruption 
of the bone of his thigh, as I haue before declared at large. So 
when I had thus viewed it, he desired me to tell him plainly, if he were 
curable or not, I answered him againe, that I was out of all doubt therof, 
if he would be content to indure some paines: Alas good sir (said he) I 
do full well know, if painfull, strong, and forcible remedies would 
haue cured me, I should not now haue needed to craue your friendship 
at this time, for I suppose I haue indured as many biting corsiue medicines 
as had beene able to haue killed a horse: Although said I you haue 
indured neuer so great paines, yet they must be strong and forcible medicines 
[^p.26^] 
that must cure you, or else God knowes when you can be made 
whole: But to answer such obiections: I say, Calmetius, a singular 
man for his knowledge in Physicke and Chirurgery, saith these words: 
"When it seemeth expedient to make incision in a fistula, and to cut away 
callous matter, or otherwise to vse hot irons, or strong powders and 
causticke medicines, and the patient is disobedient or vnwilling, and 
will not indure and abide it, then the best way is to auoid the cure, and 
not to make or meddle with it". So at the last he was perswaded, and 
very willingly was contented to indure whatsoeuer I thought meete 
& conuenient, for the speedy restoring him againe to his former health, 
&c. Then first of all I defended the greeued part, by applying rounde 
about his thigh that defensiue published in the third Chapter of this 
booke: which done, I made a tent in length and bignes of the said fistula, 
and I annointed it ouer with Vnguentum populeon simp. and so 
rowled it in, cum pulueres fiue pare, as it is published in this booke. And 
vpon the same this plaister which is commended by Paracelsus, to be singular 
good for to draw out bullets, arrow heads, and broken splinters of 
weapons. +R. Wax. lib. j. of Colophone, and Shoomakers pitch ana. 
+o. iii. dissolue them togither, and then adde thereunto of Gum. Amoniacke,

to art, and so reserue it to your vse. I say the aforesaid powder wrought 
with some sharpnes and biting, then to remooue the eschars, which were 
made by the said powder, I drest him twise a day with Vnguentum populeium 
simp. till the eschar was remooued: so that within fower or fiue 
times vsing of this powder, I might easily feele with my probe the bone 
ragged, and somwhat loose, neuertheles there were diuers turnings, and 
much callous matter towards the bottome, the which I could by no 
meanes subdue, till I made a tent onely of Vitrioli albi crudi +Q. ij. Bole 
Armeniaci +Q. +s. Misce. After this maner, I did take a quantitie of this 
[/37./] 
powder, and moistened it with fasting spittle, and then I wrought it to 
the forme of a paste, and thereof I made a tent the full length and compasse 
of the fistula, and so I let it rest till it was well hardened and dried, 
and then I conuaied it into the bottome of the fistula, where it wrought 
with some force, for by the strie facultie thereof, the callous matter 
was wholy destroied, and the continuall flowing of those humors were 
thereby staied, yet the bone was not ready to come away: for that cause 
twise a weeke I vsed vpon tents of the foresaid powder, fiue pare, 
which at the last it brought out the scale of the bone, being somewhat 
blacke and ragged. And then after by the onely application of Emplastrum 
Sticticum Paracelsi, laid vpon the orifice of the fistula, nature 
[^p.27^] 
wrought the rest of the cure, and so within a reasonable time after, he 
was perfectly healed.
