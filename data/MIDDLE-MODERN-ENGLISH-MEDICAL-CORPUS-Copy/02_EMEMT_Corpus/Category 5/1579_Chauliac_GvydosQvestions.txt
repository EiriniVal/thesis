[}CERTEINE QVESTIONS 
of Chyrurgery, with the aunsweres 
therevnto.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
WHat is Chyrurgery? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Chyrurgery is science, 
that teacheth the manner and qualitie 
to work, principally in knitting, in cutting, 
and exercising other workes of 
the hande. In healing of man, as much 
as it is possible. And heere science is put for kinde. 
And albeit that Chyrurgery is of it selfe properly by 
arte, and no science, yet for the bonde and affinytie that 
arte and science haue each with other, sometime vnproperly, 
that which is Arte, is called science, and 
that which is science is called Arte. It is otherwise 
sayde (and better) that Chyrurgery is in two manners. 
One is, that sheweth onely, so that by it we can 
doe nothing as touching the operation, and that properly 
is called Science, as wee saye in Phisicke, that 
there bee sixe manners of simple Apostumes, that 
is to witte, foure humeralles, one Aignous, and the 
other Uentous. The other manner of Chyrurgery, 
is vsaunce, that is to say, that it teacheth to vse, that 
hee that knoweth it may helpe himselfe therewith 
as many times and as often as hee will, as touching 
Chyrurgicall operations, so that by it hee is gouerned 
and ruled when hee will vse it, as by the Chyrurgery 
that hee hath in his vnderstandinge, that teacheth 
him, that in all hot Appostumes he ought to put 
and laye to it Repercossiue saue vnto them that are 
in the Emunctories, and to such as be venemous. 
This Chyrurgery or Arte that thou hast in thine 
vnderstanding, teacheth thee to woorke and vse manually 
[^f.1v^] 
in medicines,and is properly called Arte and 
not science. And in the ende of thy definition beside 
the particulers that are put for differences that are set 
vnto that which is possible, for it is not possible to all 
Chyrurgions to heale al them that are diseased & sore. 
 
[}Question.}] In what case ought a Chyrurgion to vse 
very cure? And in what cases is hee permitted to vse 
onely palliatiue cures. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] In all cases, ought he to vse very cure, 
except in three cases, where as alonely he is permitted 
the cure palliatiue. The first is, when the disease of 
themselues are vncurable, as Lazary. The seconde, for 
the inobedience of the patient to suffer the paynes that 
he ought, bicause his might cannot suffer it, as is the 
Canker in a perticuler member. The thirde, if by the 
cure of such a disease, there followeth a greater inconuenience, 
as into euill inueterate sores, or into olde Emeroides, 
if there be not alway lefte an issue there as 
any daunger is, for feare to fall into Hydropsie or Maniake, 
as Ipocras saith in his Aphorismes. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff is named Chyrurgerie. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is so named of Chyr: that is a hande, 
and of Gow: that is operation, for it is a science that 
teacheth to worke by hande, that is manually. 
 
[}Question}] What is the subiect of Chyrurgerie? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The subiect of Chyrurgerie is the body 
of man that is diseased and sore, able to be healed: for 
it is there about that the Chyrurgion worketh. 
 
[}Question.}] What is the effect of Chyrurgerie. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The effect thereoff is to take away the 
disease of mans body, and to keepe it in health, as much 
as it is possible. 
 
[}Question.}] In how many kindes or parts is Chyrurgery 
deuised. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Iohannes saith, that generally it is deuised 
in two, that is to say, to worke in soft members, as in 
[^f.2r^] 
the flesh: And to worke in harde members as the 
bones. And perticularly Chyrurgerie is deuided in v. 
That is to say, to worke in woundes, in Apostumes, in 
sores, and in restorations, and in other things belonging 
to handie operation. 
 
[}Question.}] What diuers operations exerciseth the 
Chyrurgion. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] In three diuers operations. That is to say, 
dissolue the thing continued, knit y=e= thing seperated, and 
put out the superfluous thing. To dissolue y=e= thing co~tinued, 
is by incising, cutting, or scaturusing. To reioine 
the seperate, as in consoliding the woundes, & redusing 
the lyps: And to put out the superfluous things, as in 
curing Apostumes to cleanse the~ & put away y=e= coares. 
 
[}Question.}] How many and what yrons ought a Chirurgion 
to beare in his case with him. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] He ought to haue v as Cisers, Nippers, 
Launcets, Rasours and Needles. 
 
[}Question.}] How many and what oyntments commonly 
ought the Chyrurgion to beare with him. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Fiue: That is to say, an Oyntment Basilycon 
for to rype, Apostolorum to cleanse, Aureum 
to encrease flesh: And the white oyntment for to drie & 
binde, and de Althea for to souple. 
 
[}Question.}] Of how many things and what things 
the Chyrurgion taketh his intentions for to heale sore 
folkes? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] That after Galen in his Theraperticke 
they are taken of three things. That is of things against 
nature, of naturall things, and of vnnaturall 
things, and also of their Annexes. And first he taketh 
this indication of things against nature, that is to say, 
to the knowledge of the maladye in his Nature, after 
Galen, in the seconde of his Theraperticke. And 
then come vnto the Naturalles, and after to the vnnaturalles, 
and their Annexes. And so after his 
[^f.2v^] 
indication be taken he ought to proceed to the healing 
of the pacient in all that may lye in him possible. And 
let the Chyrurgion note that it is sayd, in all that may 
lye possible in him bicause it is not alway possible. And 
with what things & how. For as Galen sayth toward 
the ende of his third booke, and in the seauenth of his 
said Therapertick, if the intentions Curatiues are few, 
and according, the cure is easie to the Chyrurgion, as 
in a simple wound. But where there is many considerations 
which in it selfe are contrarie, as in a hollow 
wound and Apostumate & nigh to a noble member, the 
Chyrurgion ought to consider three things. 
 
The first is, if there bee two contrary diseases, 
whereoff the cure of the one letteth the other (which 
is most doubtfull and daungerous if it remayne) in 
such case as hee ought to beginne his cure at the 
most daungerous, and where there is most peryll in 
the remayninge of it, and oftentimes more sooner in 
the accidentes that happeneth in a sore, then in the 
sore it selfe. And when a great fluxe of bloud ouercommeth 
in any wounde or any sore frettinge, that 
hath corroded any vaine, in such case often hee must 
leaue the healinge of the sore for to entende to the 
fluxe of the bloude that is so great. Lykewyse if in 
a sore were any sinewe that was pricked, whereof 
followeth Crampe, there must hee beginne at the 
pricking of the sinewe for daunger of the spasme, 
which is most perillous. The seconde thinge that 
the Chyrurgion ought to consider is, if one of the 
sayde diseases bee not the cause of the other, and nourysheth 
not the other. In such case hee ought to beginne 
at the cure of it that is the filler and nourysher 
of the other. For till that that which is the causer 
of the other bee totally extyrped, the healing cannot 
bee. 
 
[}Question.}] How many considerations ought the Chirurgion 
[^f.3r^] 
to haue touching his forme and general manner 
to worke manually? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] After Arnold de villa noua, he ought to 
haue iiij. The .j. is, he ought to consider what operation 
it is that he ought to doe to mans body. And it is 
knowen by the diuision of the operations of Chyrurgerie 
aforesayd, that is to knit the thing deuided. 
The second consideration is, that he ought to consider 
wherefore he worketh. And this is knowne by the generall 
intention of Chyrurgerie, that commaundeth 
to doe the operations vnto the body of man profitably, 
with confidence or surenesse. The thirde consideration 
is, that he ought to consider if such operations be necessary 
and conuenable to be done to mans body. And this 
he knoweth when it cannot be healed otherwise. And 
the fourth consideration is, that the Chyrurgion ought 
to knowe how to bestow his remedies to the body of 
man. In these considerations the Chyrurgion ought to 
take heede in dooing all things that he ought to doe, as 
touching this operation, as well before the working as 
after. The which iiij. considerations thou mayst haue 
and perceiue by such an example. If thou wilt draw 
water from the bellyes of Dropsies by manuall operation. 
First thou oughtest to consider that the operation 
which thou wilt do is to draw out the sayd water. 
Secondly, thou oughtest to consider wherfore thou dost 
it, for it is for to heale, or at the least way to giue ease. 
Thirdly, whether such operation be necessary, needfull, 
or possible. And thou oughtest to wit that it is necessary 
at least wayes: if thou wilt heale the Bodyes of Hidropsies 
confirmed, and thou knowest that it is needefull 
and possible if the might of the patient be strong, for 
if it be weake be wel ware for to doe it. And fourthly 
thou oughtest to consider the manner to doe it, which 
is such. First lay thy Patient vpright, and then with a 
rasour cut the skin of his belly vnder the nauell vnto 
[^f.3v^] 
the voyde places that are betweene the Ciphac and the 
Mirac. And also thou oughtest to make incision on the 
left side, if the disease come of the right side. Contrariwise 
make the incision on the right side, if it come 
from the left, and then put a lyttle Quill or Reede into 
the hole wherewith thou shalt draw out of that water, 
after the strength of the Patient. And when thou 
wilt draw no more, take away the quil, and let the skin 
of the belly go, that wil close the hole that no more water 
come out. And when thou wilt draw any more, do 
as thou didst before. 
 
[}Question.}] How many and what conditions ought 
a Chyrurgion to haue? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Foure, the first is, that he ought to bee 
learned & a clarke, & not onely in the principles & beginning 
of chyrurgerie, but likewise in Phisicke, & asmuch 
in Theoricke as Practicke. For in Theoricke he ought 
to know the naturall things, & vnnatural, & against nature. 
First he ought to know the vnnaturall things, & 
chiefly y=e= Anatomie, for without it nothing can be done 
surely in Chyrurgery, as it appeareth afterward more 
plainly. Also he ought to know y=e= complection of his patie~t, 
for after y=e= diuersitie of y=e= nature of y=e= bodies, ought 
the medicines to be diuersified, as Galen declareth al a 
long in his Therapertick against Thesillus. And by like 
reason ought he for to know the strength. Secondly 
he ought to know the vnnaturall things, that is the 
meat, y=e= drinke &c. for they are cause of al health when 
they be vsed as they ought to be. And also they be causes 
of all maladies when they are euill vsed, Thirdly, 
he ought to haue the knowledge of things against Nature 
which are three. The disease, the causes, and the 
accidents of the disease. First, he ought to know the disease. 
Secondely, the cause thereoff, for if hee bee healed 
otherwise (it should not be of a Saints disease, as good 
[^f.4r^] 
olde women say) it should be but case of aduenture. 
Thirdly, he ought to know the accidents that chaunce 
to come in diseases, for oftentimes it preuarieth the 
selfe same cure of the diseases, as Galen declareth in the 
beginning of the booke y=t= he sent to Glaucon his disciple. 
As I sayd before he ought for to know y=e= vnnaturall 
things, & to minister them as they ought, that are 
meate, drinke. &c. Also by this ye shall vnderstand that 
the Chyrurgion ought to know how to minister medicines 
laxatiues, which are one of the instruments of 
Phisicke as of Chyrurgery, without the which the science 
of Chyrurgerie cannot be complete. And this hee 
ought to know as touching the practize. Thus then appeareth 
the verification of the first condition that a 
Chyrurgion ought to haue, for he ought to be lettered 
& learned. And this condition declareth Galen in 
the first booke of the Theraperticke against Thesillus, 
where he saith at this point. If Phisitions had nothing 
to doe with Astronomie, Geometrie, Logicke, Grammer, 
nor w=t= other good doctrines, the Coblars, Curriers 
of lether, Carpenters, Smithes, and such manner of 
people would leaue their crafts and runne to Phisick, 
and become Phisitions. The second condition y=t= a Chirurgion 
should haue, is to be expert, and ought to haue 
seene other masters worke. And this witnesseth Auenzoar, 
when hee sayde thus. It behoueth that euery 
Phisition first know and then to haue vse and experience. 
 
The thirde condition that a Chyrurgion ought to 
haue is, that he ought not to be a foole, vnwittie, nor of 
rude vnderstanding. But as Haly saith in the thirde 
booke de Regni, he ought to be a man of good memory, 
of good iudgement, of good dilygence, of a cleere sight, 
whole of minde and of his members, with slender fingers 
and a stedfast hande without shaking. The 
fourth condition that a Chyrurgion shoulde haue, is 
[^f.4v^] 
that he ought to be wel manered, bold, & sure in things 
that be not to be feared. And doubtful, & feareful in perillous 
things. And ought to eschew al desperate cures, 
and ought to be gentle to his patientes, well willyng 
to his company, wittie in prognosticating, chast, sober, 
meeke and mercifull, not auaricious, nor extorcioner 
for money, but after the capacitie of the Patient, and 
the facultie receiued, competent and moderate reward. 
 
[}Question.}] How many and what conditions ought 
the Patient to haue that will be healed by the Arte of 
Chyrurgerie. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] That he ought to haue iij. conditions. The 
j. y=t= he ought to be obedient to his Chyrurgion, as the 
seruant toward his master, as Galen declareth in the 
first of his Therapertick. The second condition of the 
patient, is that he ought to haue trust in his chyrurgion, 
for he healeth most in whom he trusteth most, as Galen 
saith in the first booke of Pronostickes. And the thirde 
condition is, that he take patience in himselfe, for patience 
is it that ouercommeth. 
 
[}Question.}] How many and what conditions ought 
the assistants and seruaunts or ministers of the Patient 
haue. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] As Galen saith in the ende of the first 
Commentarie of the Aphorismes. The conditions of 
the company, ministers, and seruaunts of them that 
are diseased ought to be such as pleaseth the patient, 
so that they ought to haue agreable seruaunts putte to 
them, being true, louing, peaceable, gentle, and discreet. 
 
[}Heere beginneth the seconde treatise, wherin is demaunded, 
and aunswered vnto certeine questions 
and difficulties touching the Anatomie.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
WHether the science of the Anatomie be necessarie 
and needefull to the Chyrurgion or not. 
 
[^f.5v^] 
[}Aunswere.}] Yea, the science of Anatomy is needeful 
and necessary to the Chyrurgion, as it appeareth by 
two reasons. The first Galen putteth in the vi. booke 
of his Theraperticke, and is such, for the Chyrurgions 
that be ignoraunt in the Anatomie, maye erre in many 
manners in their incision of sinues and their knittings, 
the which if they knew the nature of euery member, 
their setting and collygation that they haue in all the 
body, and with euery onely member perticular, if it 
did happen that they were hurt they should know if y=e= 
sinewes were cut or not. And by this same reason they 
should not erre in their incisio~s. And this reason is confirmed 
by an example that Henry de Maundeuile putteth, 
saying that after the same manner that a blynde 
man worketh in hewing of a log, so doth a Chyrurgion 
that knoweth not y=e= Anatomie. For like as a blind ma~ y=t= 
hewath on a log knoweth not how much he shold hew 
thereoff, nor how, & therfore co~monly he erreth in hewing 
more or lesse then he ought to do. Likewise so doth 
the Chyrurgion y=t= worketh in mans body without the 
Anatomie. Also the said Henry approueth y=t= the Chyrurgion 
ought of necessitie to know the Anatomie. For euery 
worke-man is bounde to know the subiect of his 
worke in which hee worketh, or els he should erre in 
working. Then lykewise if it so be that y=e= subiect of the 
Chyrurgion be the body of mankinde, it must be of necessitie 
that the Chyrurgion do know the body of mankinde 
in it selfe and in the parts thereoff, so then it is 
necessary for a Chyrurgion to know the Anatomie. 
And this is for the first part of the Question. 
 
[}Question.}] The second part is, to know in how many 
and what things the science of Anatomie is necessary 
to the Chyrurgion. That is to say how many profits 
and vtilities be of the science of Anatomie. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The science of the Anatomie is necessarie 
and needfull to the Chyrurgion for foure vtilities. 
[^f.5v^] 
The first and the greatest is for the meruayle of the 
great power of God the creator of men, that so hath 
made them to his lykenesse and forme. The seconde is 
for to haue the knowledge of the members that may be 
diseased. The thirde for bicause to haue knowledge to 
tell the dispositions to come of the members. The 
fourth is for to heale the diseases that come to the 
members. 
 
[}Question.}] What is Anatomie, and whereoff is it 
deriuate. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Anatomie is the right determination 
and diuision of euery particuler member of the bodye 
of mankinde. And is deriuate of Ana, that is to saye, 
(night) that is to say (diuision.) Thus Anatomie, is 
called night diuision of members, done for certeine 
knowledges. 
 
[}Question.}] In how many & which manners ought 
the science of Anatomie to be taught. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] In two manners, that is to say, by way 
of doctrine as by bookes written thereoff. In seeing & 
reading that which hath bene written by auncient 
Doctors, and by experience, in deuising and Anatomising 
the deade corpses. As did Mundy and Boloine, and 
as lykewise did master Bertuce, that when hee had 
a dead body by beheading or otherwise, he layd him on 
a bench in making foure particions. In the first he deuided 
the nutratiue members, for they be disposed to 
putrification: And in the seconde, spirituall members. 
And in the thirde, the animall members. And in the 
fourth the extremities. And vpon euery member ought 
to be sought ix. things. That is to say, the position, the 
complection, the substaunce, the quantitie, the number, 
the figure, the operation, the vtilytie, and what diseases 
may come-therevnto. 
 
[}Question.}] What is the body humaine? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is one whole together decorate, with 
[^f.6r^] 
reason, composed of many and diuers members. 
 
[}Question.}] What is member. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Diuers Authours haue giuen diuers definitions. 
G. in the first booke of the vtilitie of the particles 
saith, it is a body that is not wholy seperate, nor 
wholy conioint to another. And also in the first booke 
of his Canon, he defineth it in plurall, and sayth thus, 
that members are bodyes, that are engendred of the 
first commiction of humors. 
 
[}Question.}] How many manners of members are 
found? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Two: That is to say, simple members 
called consemblables, and members compost. The simple 
members are they that may not be deuided into another 
kinde, but what parte thou takest of them it 
beareth away y=e= name and the definition of his whole. 
As the bone, for what part thou takest of the bone be it 
more or lesse euer it beareth the name and definition of 
the bone, for euery parte of a bone is bone, and euery 
part of a sinew is sinew. The compost members contrarily 
be they that may be deuided in other kindes, for 
no part of them seperated beareth not away the name 
of all. As the hande, the legge, the heade. 
 
[}Question.}] How many simple members are 
there. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] There be xi. That is to say, the bones, 
gristles, or cartilages, the sinewes, the vaynes, the 
arteres, the pannicules, the stringes. 
The cordes, the skinne, the flesh, the greace or fatte, 
the haire, and the nayles. 
 
The which although that veritably they bee not 
members, neuerthelesse in asmuch as they haue vtilitie 
in the body of mankinde, and haue regeneration as 
the members, they be called members though it be vnproperly. 
 
[}Question.}] If all the members maye regenerate 
[^f.6v^] 
after their perdition, and knit againe after their dislocation? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] For to declare that, it behoueth two 
things to be noted. First the simple members be of two 
manners. Some be sanguine members of whom the generation 
is of sanguine matter, as the flesh and the 
greace. And the other members be spermaticke members 
so named, bicause they haue their breeding and beginning 
of spermaticke matter. Secondly it is to bee 
noted that there be two manners of regeneration. 
One is very regeneration, which is very reformation 
of the member in the selfe same substaunce, forme, qualytie 
and quantitie: and other such accidents properly 
as it was afore the corruption and alteration. And the 
other is regeneration, not very, but like therto as nigh 
as may be. And lykewise there is two manners of consolydation, 
one is true, that is when both the partes of 
the thing that is dissolued by seperating, and reassembled 
and knit without any manner of appearing of the 
dissolution afore, and without any meanes. And the 
other is vntrue consolydacion and like to the other as 
nigh as can be done, by meanes of the Poore, that the 
Phisitions call Porus sarcoides. These things vnderstood 
and noted, I say first, that all sanguine members 
may regenerate & knit, by very regeneration & consolidation 
for continually ther engendreth blood inough w=t= 
in y=e= body for to regenerate the substance of y=e= sanguine 
me~ber lost, & for to reconsolidate & knit it again. I say, 
secondly y=t= no members spermatike after y=e= losse of their 
substaunce may not regenerate bicause that their matter 
is attribuate to them at the very beginning of their 
creation, and after that neuer engender agayne. And 
also for their solyditie, and bicause they are weake of 
heate and moysture. And for these causes and reasons 
they do not reconsolydate with true reconsolydation, 
after the desolution of their seperating, but Nature 
[^f.7r^] 
strengthening alwaies possible things the best that she 
may, will not leaue them thus dissolute, reioyneth and 
knitteth them the best that she may, and engendereth 
a flesh (for to holde the dissolued parts) that is called 
Porus sarcoides. 
 
[}Question.}] Be all the members consemblables of 
one complection? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] No, for some be hotte and moist, and 
the other colde and moyst, and other colde and dry. 
And of the hotte and drye there is none, for among all 
members consemblables there is none more hotte and 
drye then the skinne that is temperate. And it is not 
only temporate among the members of mankinde, but 
also among all the substaunces of things that may engender 
and corrupt as Galen saith in his first booke 
of Complections, and the last Chapter. The members 
hotte and moyst be the members that are sanguine, as 
the flesh, the spirits, and the naturall humidities, as 
willeth Auerrois in the second of Colliges. The members 
colde and moist, are the fleume, fat, or the greace, 
and the marrowes. The members colde and drye, are 
al the other members after their degrees, as the bones, 
the cartilages, the strings or cordes, the lyguments, 
the sinewes, the vaynes, arteres and pannicules. And 
heere is the maine sea, whereas it behoueth neyther 
Phisition nor Chyrurgion to sayle, for a Phisition and 
Chyrurgion ought for to know the complection of the 
members, as naturall Philosophers. 
 
[}Question.}] Which are the members composts, and 
wherefore are they called Organykes and instrumentalls? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The members composts, be members 
that are composed of the simple and consemblable members, 
and therefore they be called Therogenes, that is 
to say, of diuers natures, and may be deuided in diuers 
kindes, that is to say, into members consemblables, 
[^f.7v^] 
and their parts beareth not awaye the definition and 
reason of the whole. As to the seconde question that 
asketh why they be called organikes & instrumentals? 
The aunswere is, bicause they are instruments of the 
soule, as by the hands, the feete, the lyuer, the face, & 
the semblables. 
 
[}Question.}] How be the Organicke members ordeined 
and composed. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Some of these members be principals, and 
the other not principals. 
 
[}Question.}] How many principal members be there, 
and how many vnprincipall? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Ther be foure principals, that is to say, 
the heart, the lyuer, the braine, and the genitalls, all 
the other be called vnprincipalls. 
 
[}Question.}] Of what complection is the heart. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The heart is hot, bicause it is lyke the 
very burning hot ouen of all the body, from whence 
commeth the heate to all the body. And albeit that 
Philosophers haue willed to say that it is temperate, 
bicause it is principle, and that it giueth beginning of 
lyfe. Neuerthelesse the heart is drie in his complection, 
bicause of his composition, for it is composed of 
strings and pannicles, and of hard and stiffe flesh. 
 
[}Question.}] Of what complection is the lyuer. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is hotte and moist. For the most 
part of the things that it is composed off, is fleshly, bloody, 
& therwith are transmised diuers pipes or arteres. 
 
[}Question.}] Of what complection is the brayne. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is colde and moist, bicause it hath a 
marowy substaunce. Neuerthelesse it differeth from 
the Marowe, bicause the Brayne is a sparmaticke 
member, and the marow is a sanguine member. 
And thereby it is colde in comparison of other members, 
and that not simply, for all members be naturally 
hotte. 
 
[^f.8r^] 
[}Question.}] Of what complection are the kidneis and 
the milt? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The kidneis be hotte and moist, howbeit 
the kidneis be not so hotte as the milt, bicause of 
the grosse bloode that is in the milte, lyke as the milte 
is not so hotte as the lyuer. 
 
[}Question.}] Of what complection is the longes. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Hotte and moist. It is hotte bicause that 
heat is sent to it from the heart, as Galen saith in the 
fourth booke of the vitilytie of y=e= particles, and is moist 
but not so moist as the greace, for it melteth not at the 
fire as the greace doth. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the skinne or the lether.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
VVHat is the skinne? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is a couering of the body of 
mankinde, that is composed and context and wouen 
with thrids and vaynes, with sinewes and arteres, for 
to defend the body and giue it feeling. 
 
[}Question.}] How many manners of skinnes or leather 
are there? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Two, one is extrinsicke or out foorth, 
and that is properly called lether. The other is intrinsicke, 
and that is properly called pannicle, rim or skin, 
as be those of the head that couer the braine and the 
skull, & they that couer the bowells of the body. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie of the greace.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
WHat is the greace. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is a thing in the humaine body, 
that is as oyle that chafeth and humecteth the body. 
 
[}Question.}] How manye manners of greace bee 
there. 
 
[^f.8v^] 
[}Aunswere.}] Two: The one is without foorth neere 
to the skin, and that properly is called Adeps or fatnesse. 
And the other is inward and nigh to the belly, 
and properly is called Auxunge or fat greace. 
 
[}Questions vppon the Anathomie 
of the flesh.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
HOw many manners of flesh are founde? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Three: One is very flesh and proper, 
and it is founde but in a lyttle quantitie, and one 
in two places of the body of mankinde. That is on the 
head of the yeard, and betweene the teeth. The other 
is Granduluster, Odenos, or cruddie and kirnel, as is 
the flesh of the ballockes, of the dugges and the flesh 
of the Emuntories. The other is flesh musculous or 
lacertous, that is hard as Bawme stiffe or knottie. 
And this is founde in great quantitie, and ouer all the 
body whereas is any manifest mouings. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Muscles 
and Lacerts.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
BE the muscles simple members? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Yea, as touching the sensible 
iudgement: Howbeit of very truth they are 
me~bers composed of sinewes, of lines, strings, 
thrids, & flesh that fulfilleth them, and of the panicule 
that couereth them. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherein agreeth and differeth the muscles 
and lacerts? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is all one thing, which after diuers 
[^f.9r^] 
considerations hath ben called muscle and lacerte, for it 
is called muscle for his resemblaunce of a Mouse, that 
in Latine hight Mus. And it is called lacerte, bicause 
it hath the forme of a Lyzard. For lyke as those two 
beasts are big in the middle & slender toward the tayle, 
so is the muscle or lacerte. 
 
[}Question.}] What is the manner and how doe the 
muscles and lacerts proceede in the body of mankinde. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] After that the muscles is composed as 
is aforesaide, from it descendeth rounde strings and 
cordes that commeth nigh to the ioynts, y=e= which when 
they be nigh the ioynts they do spread abroad and enlarge, 
and raise the ioynt all about with the pannicle 
that couereth the bones. And when they are passed 
the ioynt, they doe waxe rounde agayne, and returne 
into cordes and with the flesh make an other muscle. 
And of this muscle procedeth and riseth an other round 
cord and strings that bindeth the ioynt all about and 
moueth it. And so ceaseth not to proceed till they come 
to the extreame and furthest particles of the body. 
And thus alwaye the muscle proceedeth the ioynture. 
And as the sinewes that proceede of the noddle, taketh 
forme of muscle at the necke and at the breast, & then 
commeth to the ioynt of the shoulder. And becommeth 
rounde strings and spreading flat in comprising al the 
ioynt, and doe plant them in the bone of the ioynt and 
moueth it. And when they come from the ioynt of the 
shoulder, a two or three fingers breadth, they waxe 
rounde in corde wise. And with the flesh and string, that 
commeth from the head to the bone of the shoulder is 
made muscle vpon the middes of the bone of the iointure, 
from which commeth a corde that three fingers 
bredth from the elbow, enlargeth and compriseth all 
the elbowe and moueth the lyttle arme. And three 
fingers beyonde it waxeth rounde and retourneth into 
a cord. The which with the string that commeth from 
[^f.9v^] 
the necke and with the flesh make a muscle vpon the 
sayd lyttle arme, of which muscle is made a cord, and 
three fingers from the ioynt of the little hande it spredeth 
and compriseth all the ioynture of the sayd hand, 
then it twisteth round againe, and entereth the muscle 
of the middes of the hand, of y=e= which commeth cords, 
that moue the fingers, by y=e= which things it appereth 
that the wounds that are made about three fingers of 
the ioynts be perillous, for the sinewy cords bee made 
bare of the flesh and apparents. Of the which all onely 
pricking is cause of spasme or crampe, and of death as 
Galen saith in y=e= third booke de Regni & y=e= second of 
his Theraperticke, which is to be noted of the Chyrurgion. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the sinewes.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
WHat is sinew. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is a simple member created to 
giue feeling and mouing to the members deputed to nature. 
 
[}Question.}] For how many distributary intencions 
were they created? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] After Galen in the fourth booke of the 
vtilytie of the particles in the last Chapter, they were 
created for three intentions. One is to giue feeling to the 
Organikes sensitiues. The seconde to giue mouing to 
the motiue and stirring members. And thirdly to giue 
knowledge to all the other members of the things that 
hurt them. And it is notably sayd to the sensitiue or feelyng 
members. For in the cartilages or gristles, nor in 
bones, nor glandilous or cruddy flesh the sinewes bee 
not penetrate but in the teeth, as Galen sayth in the 
booke aforesayd. 
 
[}Question.}] From whence breedeth the sinewes? 
[^f.10r^] 
 
[}Aunswere.}] All the sinewes of the body breede and 
come out of the brayne by it selfe, or of the noddle, that 
is his vicare, betweene the which some breede of y=e= forepart 
of the brayne, and they be softer and more proper 
to giue feelyng then mouing. And the other come out & 
breede of the hinder part of the noddle, which descend 
from the brayne, and these be harder, and more proper 
to giue mouing then feelyng. 
 
[}Question.}] Is the feelyng and mouing by one selfe 
sinew alone or by many? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] After Galen in the first booke of the interiours, 
sometime they are borne by one sinew alone, 
and sometime by many. 
 
[}Question.}] How many parel or lyke sinewes be ther 
that without meane spring and breede of the brain. And 
how many parel or lyke sinewes commeth from it by 
meanes of the noddle. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] From the braine immediately springeth 
vij. parells. And xxx. parells come from it by meane 
of the nuke that breedeth behinde by the ende of y=e= Lossarn, 
as Haly Abas saith in his booke de Regali dispotione, 
in the second sermon of the fore part. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the strings or lynes.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
OF what nature be the lynes or strings, and wheroff 
breede they? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They be of the nature of sinewes, howbeit 
they breede of the bones. 
 
[}Question.}] How many manners of lynes or strings 
be there? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Two: Some bindeth the bones inward. 
And the other bindeth the ioynts outward, as Galen 
sayth in the twelfth booke of the vtilytie of the Particles 
in the first Chapiter, of cowplynge of bones, 
[^f.10v^] 
that they are comprised about with strong braunched 
stringes. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the cordes.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
OF what nature are the cords. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The strings be almost as all of one 
nature, for both be of the nature of sinewes, but yet the 
cords more then the strings. For lyke as the strings 
be meane among the cordes and the bones, so be the 
cordes meane among the strings and the sinewes. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff breede the cordes, and whence 
take they feeling and mouing? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They breede of the muscles, and take 
feeling and mouing of the sinewes, whereby the members 
are moued. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherefore is it that when the cordes 
withoutfoorth are cut the member leeseth boowing, and 
when they withinfoorth are cut the member leeseth the 
stretching. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Albeit the cords bee rounde when they 
issue of the muscle, yet doe they spread when they come 
to the ioynt, and they are lynes or strings that are set 
rounde about the sayd ioynt, as the cords about the 
member, so that they within foorth draw the member, 
and they without foorth do stretch it. And when the one 
draweth the other loseth. And so when they are cutte 
outwarde the bowing is lost. And when they are cutte 
inward the stretching is lost. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie of the 
veynes and arteres.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
[^f.11r^] 
WHat is a vayne? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is the place of the bloud of nourishing. 
 
[}Question.}] What is artere. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is the place of the spirituall bloude. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherein doe agree and differ the veines 
from the arteres. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They doe agree in that they bee of 
consemblable distribucion through all the body, that is 
in bearing of bloode. And they differ in two things. 
The first appeareth by their definitions aforesaid, that 
is, that the veynes beareth the nourishing bloode, and 
the arteres the spirituall bloode. The second difference 
betweene them is taken of the place of their breeding. 
For y=e= veynes breed of the liuer, and the arteres of the 
heart, as Galen sayth in the xvii. booke of the particles. 
 
[}Question.}] Do they seperate in any wise one from 
the other in the body of mankinde, so that the veynes 
may be without the arteres, and the arteres without 
the veynes. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] In some places the veynes doe seperate 
from the arteres. And the arteres be founde without 
veynes. As it is manifest both in the armes, and in 
Rhete mirabile, howbeit no veyne is founde without 
arteres. 
 
[}Question.}] What is the manner of proceeding of 
the veynes and arteres through the body? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] When they goe foorth of the place of 
their breeding, they runne forkewise in two parts, the 
one vpward and the other downward, and yet of them 
euery parte brauncheth & proceedeth vnto the last and 
extreame parts of the body for to nourish and giue life 
to all the members thereoff. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the bones.}] 
 
[^f.11v^] 
[}Question.}] 
VVHerefore are the bones made? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Bicause they should be the foundation 
of all the body and susteining theroff. And therefore 
they are made hard and strong the better to beare 
the burthen of al the other. Howbeit some of the bones 
are made for y=e= defence of the inward members, as the 
bones of the head, the breast bone, and the backe bone. 
 
[}Question.}] How many in number are all the bones 
in a body of mankinde. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Auicen sayth that there is CC.xlviij. 
saue the bone that is called (Os laude) whereto the 
tongue is founded. The which bones thou maist consider 
and see by the figure heere before written, and of 
which particuler mention shall be made and declared 
in this present treatie. 
 
[}Question.}] How be the diuersities among the bones 
of the body of mankinde? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They be diuersified in diuers manners, 
for some bicause of the ioynts are full of marowes, and 
the other not. Some are streight, and other crooked. 
Some are lyttle and some big. And al bones are bigger 
at the endes then in the middes by reason of the 
ioynts. And some are embossed for to enter, and other 
haue vacuits that receiueth. And some haue both the 
one and the other. And other haue neyther one, nor 
the other. And of them that haue embossings, and vacuits, 
some haue them clauelares like keyes as y=e= teeth, 
& other be sacratils or saw wise, as y=e= skul of the head. 
And other knottie in each ende as Vlna in the Thigh. 
Other be foueable or hollow as y=e= faucils or forkbones. 
Other haue both sorts, as the fingers. And they that 
haue neither one nor other be ioyned solydatiuely, and 
they that haue the embossings and vacuations be they 
that make the ioynts, of whome commeth disloration 
and other seperations. 
 
[^f.12r^] 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie of 
the cartilages or gristles.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
VVHat is cartilage? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is a substaunce as it were 
of the kinde of bones, but it is softer or sowpler then 
the bone is. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherefore were the cartilages made? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] For two reasons. One to fulfill the lack 
of the bone, as in the palpebres or eye lyddes, the nosethrills, 
and eares. The seconde to make the better coniunction 
of the bones with the parts next them, as in 
Thorax and parties of the loynes, bicause that the soft 
substaunce, (as the flesh and other parts) be not hurt by 
the mouing of the bones which are harde? 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the nayles.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
VVHerefore are the nayles made of the vtter 
partes of the body? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The better to take holde. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the haires.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
WHerefore were the haires made? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] For two reasons, that is to witte, 
to encrease beautie and to purge. 
 
[}Heere endeth the first particle of the second treatie. 
And beginneth the second particle, whereas is aunswered 
vnto certeine questions and difficulties vppon 
the Anatomie of the members composed.}] 
 
[^f.12v^] 
[}Question.}] 
WHat is the skull or scawpe of the head. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is that part of the head that 
is full of haire, wherein the animall members 
are conteined. 
 
[}Question.}] Upon the seuen things that a good Anatomist 
ought to consider on euery member, which are in 
the skull or scawpe of the head. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] First his helping appeareth by definition 
aboue sayd. The position thereoff is on the highest 
place of the body. The collygaunce is notorious, for 
it hath collygaunce with the face and the necke, and of 
it commeth all the partes of the face, and the muscles 
mouing the heade bee planted in the necke, which are 
of two manners: Some be properly lacertes that 
breede nigh the eares, till they come to the furcules or 
forkes of the breast. The other be common in the neck 
and head which shall be sayd when we speake of the 
necke. The quantitie is more in man then in any other 
beast, as the braine is more in man then in anye 
other beast. The forme thereoff is round, comprimate 
lyghtly from one part to another. And it behoueth that 
the part before and behinde be bony, as Galen sayth, 
in the seconde de regni. And the other cause of this 
forme sayth Galen in the viij. booke of the vtilitie of 
the particles, bicause that it may be the lesse passible. 
The substaunce is bony and full of marow as appeareth 
by experience. The complection is cold by meanes 
of the parts that it is composed off be colde. 
 
[}Question.}] Of how many and what partes is the 
scawpe of the heade composed. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] After Auicen in the iij. booke of his canon 
and first Chapter, it is composed of x. parts. That is to 
say, v. conteining: and v. sundry. The contenauntes 
that be without, first are the haires, then the lether or 
skinne, and then the flesh musculous, then the great 
[^f.13r^] 
pannicle, and then the braine panne skull or crane. And 
the sundry ensuing withinfoorth be the dura mater and 
the pio mater, and then Rhete mirable, and then the 
substaunce of the braine, and then the bone that is the 
foundation of the braine, and then the rootes of the sinewes 
that breede of the brayne, which shall be spoken 
off by order. 
 
[}Question.}] Of what substaunce is the great pannicle 
that is called Pericranium, and whereoff breedeth it, 
and with what parts hath it collygaunce? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] First, it is a neruous or sinewy substaunce. 
Secondly, it is bred of the dura mater. And 
thirdly, it hath collygaunce with the sayd dura mater, 
and is bound with it, by strings, sinewes, and veynes 
that go in and out by the commissures or seames of the 
braine panne, or skull. 
 
[}Question.}] Is the braine pan of one bone or of many 
and for what reason? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is of many, for it is of vii. that ioyne 
together and is so ordeyned, bicause that if anoyaunce 
come to one that it should not come to another and is 
conioynt with y=e= commissures called sarratilles seames 
endented as teeth of a saw, to the intent that the fumosities 
or vapours may haue issue from the braine. 
 
[}Question.}] Which are the vij. that the head is composed 
off. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The first bone of the fore part is called 
Coronall, that dureth and compriseth from the middes 
of the orbyraunts vnto the commissure that trauerseth 
the crane or skul. And in it is the holes of the eyes, and 
the collatores of the nosethrills. The which collatores 
be departed by the adding of bones in manner of a crest 
of a henne, within the which is fastened the cartilages 
or gristles that deuideth the nosethrills. Howbeit it is 
to be vnderstood that sometime the coronall is deuided 
by a commissure in the middes of the browe, which 
[^f.13v^] 
most often is founde in women. The seconde bone of 
the head in the hinder part is called Occipitall, and is 
enclosed by a co~missure thwartly in ma~ner of a Greeke 
letter called Lampda, and is hard, and full of pearced 
holes beneath, by the which descendeth the nuke of the 
brayne through the middes of the spondilles or ridge 
bones till vnto the ende of the backe. The thirde and 
fourth bone of the heade, is in the middle of the sides 
thereoff. and therefore they be called peritalls, and bee 
deuided by a commissure after the length of the noddle 
of the head, and by two commissures be ledde vnto the 
bones of the eares & are square. The fifth and the sixt 
be the bones that are called Petrous, for they are hard 
as a stone. Also they be called Scamous or scale, for 
they be conioynt in manner of the scales of a fish, with 
the sayd Parietalles which are the holes of the eares, 
and the instruments mamilares of the Emunctures. 
And be braunched as lyke the bones called Perietalls 
with the commissure (called Lampda) vnto the bones 
of the temples. The seauenth bone is the bone Basilare, 
that is lyke a wedge that closeth and susteineth al 
the sayd bones ouer the roofe, and this bone is pearced, 
and hath great spongeositie to purge the grose superfluities 
and is of a grose substaunce. And these seauen 
bones abouesaid are principalls. Howbeit beside these 
sayd bones, there are yet other small bones lesse principals 
that are made for certeine helpes, as is the bone 
of the Crete that deuideth y=e= nosethrills within the coronal, 
and the equal bones that are in the face. And the 
claual bones, that are the bones of the eares wherevnto 
are fastened the muscles and cordes that couer the 
Iawes. 
 
[}Question.}] How ought the parts inward of the head 
be well seene and knowen at the eye. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Ye ought to deuide the skull with a saw 
after the roundenesse. 
 
[^f.14r^] 
[}Question.}] What is the dura mater and pie mater? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They be two pannicles full of veynes 
and arteres, whereoff one is of the part of the heade, 
and the other of the part of the brayne that wrappeth 
and couereth all the substaunce of the brayne. 
 
[}Question.}] From whence commeth the nourishing 
into the braine? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It commeth from the soft mother by 
veines and arteres that commeth by the holes of the inward 
bones, and outwarde by the commissures of the 
superiour bones. 
 
[}Question.}] Where is the substaunce of the brayne 
situate, and of what shape, and of what substaunce and 
colour is it off? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] First it is situate vnder the foote of the 
hard mother, & is round in shape, and white of coulour. 
 
[}Question.}] By what reason are the members Organikes, 
sensitiues, and diuers other double. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Bicause that if one of them suffered, the 
other should not suffer. 
 
[}Question.}] How many celles hath the brayne after 
his length, and how many parts in each ventricle, and 
how many and what vertues taketh their origine in 
each part? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] First, the braine in length hath three ventricles, 
that is to say, the ventricle afore, that behinde, 
and that in the middes, & the anteriour & meane, each is 
deuided in two parts. In each part one vertue taketh 
his origine. In the first part of the vntricle before is 
put the common bloode. In the second the vertue of imagination. 
In the middle ventricle is put the cogitatiue 
and rationall. And in the hinder ventricle is put the 
vertue reseruatiue or memoratiue. 
 
[}Question.}] Which of these three ventricles are the 
biggest. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The formost is the biggest. The middlemost 
[^f.14v^] 
the least and the hindermost is meane. 
 
[}Question.}] Hath the blood of the other ventricle any 
wayes? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Yes, wherethrough all the spirits passe. 
 
[}Question.}] In which of the ventricles, is the witte of 
smellyng found? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] In the formost ventricle, where the adding 
mamillares are, it is founded. 
 
[}Question.}] How many couples of sensitiue sinewes 
come from the brayne and from which part? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] From the anteriour part commeth vij. 
paire of sinewes sensitiues which goe to the eyes, to 
the eares, to the stomacke and other members. 
 
[}Question.}] In which ventricle of the brayne are the 
places called Lacune, Vernus, Fornus, and Ancafernis, 
and the Glandinous flesh that fulfilleth them? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They be in the meane ventricle. 
 
[}Question.}] Where is Rhete mirabile set, & whereoff 
is it composed? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is set vnder the panniclles, and is 
onely composed of arteres that commeth from the hart. 
 
[}Question.}] Where is the vitall spirite made animal 
and how? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is made of the sayde arteres, that 
Rhete mirabile, is composed by the labour of the complection 
of the brayne. 
 
[}Question.}] Is the nuke any part of the brayne? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It seemeth to be a part theroff and therfore 
the signes and accidents are as they of the brain, 
as Galen saith in the xi booke of the vtilitie of the particles. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff breedeth the marrow of the 
nuke, and how. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It breedeth of y=e= hinder part of the brain, 
wrapped with two pannicles as the brayne. 
 
[}Question.}] How proceedeth the marow of the nuke, 
[^f.15r^] 
and what sinewes breede of it? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It descendeth by the spondiles vnto the 
ende of the backe and of it breedeth motiue sinewes. 
 
[}Question,}] What diseases may come to the scalpe of 
the heade? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] There may come wounds, Apostumes, 
and ill complections. 
 
[}Question.}] What wounds of the scalpe of the head 
be most perillous? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] To penetrate all the skull, but more the 
touching of the rimmes, but most of all that touchech 
the substaunce medulare. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherefore is it, that the operations 
Chyrurgicals that are done about the commissures be 
suspect? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] For feare least the dura mater, fall not 
on the pie mater, and that it comprime the braine. 
 
[}Question.}] How ought the incisions of the head bee 
made? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They ought to be made according as the 
haires doe proceede, for so proceedeth the muscles. 
 
[}Questions vpon the Anatomie 
of the face and parts thereoff.}] 
 
[}Question.}] 
WHich are the parts of the face whereoff it is composed. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] The browes, the eyes, the nosethrills, 
the eares, the temples, the cheekes, the Iaw bone, with 
the teeth. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff is the forehead composed. 
 
[}Aunswere}] One of the skinne and musculous flesh, 
for the bone vnderneath is of the Coronall. 
 
[}Question.}] How is the forme of the browes made? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Of the bone that is vnder the browe, for 
[^f.15v^] 
the spongeositie of the seconde table of the saide bone 
is raised along as if it were double, and that maketh 
the forme of the browes. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherefore are the browes made? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They are made for the more beautie, and 
to saue the eyes, and therfore the eyes are armed with 
them. 
 
[}Question.}] How ought incisions be made in those 
parts? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They ought to be made after the length 
of the body, for so proceedeth the nuke and not after the 
rugnesse. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherefore are the eyes made and wher 
are they set? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They are made to be instruments of 
the sight, and are set within the bone arbitall, that is a 
part of the Coronall, and the bones of the temples. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherfore are the sinewes obtikes perced? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] For to be the way of the spirite visible. 
 
[}Question.}] What is the manner that proceedeth the 
Obtike sinewes from their breeding vnto the eyes? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is thus, for first they proceede from 
both the sides, one heere and another there, and when 
they are within the skul they come and ioine together 
and then deuide them each from the part that is bred, 
and proceede not thwart each ouer other crosse wise, 
from the right side to the left side, nor from the left side 
to the right side, as some haue sayd. 
 
[}Question.}] Of how many vestures or tunicles are 
the eyes composed? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Of vij. The first without is called Coniunctiua, 
that is thick and white. And it compasseth all 
the eye except that that appeareth of that that is called 
Cornea, and it is bread of the pannicle that couereth 
the skull that compasseth all the eye, suppose that in it 
selfe is but three, yet for the diuersitie of colours that 
[^f.16r^] 
taketh about the middes of the eye, that is called Iris, 
it is sayde that there is sixe whereoff the other three be 
of the part of the braine, the other three be of the part 
withoutfoorth. The first breedeth of dura mater, and in 
the inward part it is called Stirotiqua, and in the outward 
Cornea. The second breedeth of pia mater, and 
of the inward part it is called Secundina, and of the outward 
part it is called Vnca. The third breedeth of y=e= sinew 
Abtike, and of the inward part is called Rethina, 
and of the outward part on the humour Christallin it 
is called Aranea. 
 
[}Question.}] Of how many humors is the eye composed? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Of foure. The first that is sette in the 
midst of the eye is called humour Christallin bicause it 
is of y=e= colour of christal in forme of a haile stone, wher 
in principally is founded the sight. After this humor so 
nigh the braine is the glasie humor that susteyneth and 
compriseth al the hinder part of the humor Christalin. 
And both these humors be wrapped with pannicle oblyke. 
The thirde humor that is on the fore part is called 
the humor Albugineus. And this humor is betwen 
the sayd web or tunicle called Rhetina and that which 
breedeth of pia mater. The fourth humor putteth Galen 
in the booke of the vtilities of the particles and last 
Chapiter, that is called the humoure Ethera lucida, 
in the region of the blacke of the eye, and it is all spirituall. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff is the eye composed beside the 
parts aforesayde. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Ouer and beside these foresayd things 
the eye is composed of mouing sinewes, desce~ding from 
the seconde equalitie of sinewes comming downe 
from the brayne, and the sixe muscles that moue them, 
and from the veynes and arteres, and the spongeous 
[^f.16v^] 
flesh that fulfill the places about the lachrimall, and 
the palpabres neighbours cartilaginouses with hiares 
determined, closing the superiour parts with a muscle, 
and opening with two transuersall muscles. 
 
[}Question.}] Of how many substaunces is the nose, 
and how many, and what particles hath euery substaunce. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is of three substaunces, that is to say, 
of substaunce fleshly, bony, and cartilaginous. The 
fleshly substaunce hath the skinne, and two muscles about 
the hinder part. The bony substaunce hath two 
trianguler bones, wherewith the bridge is raysed vp, & 
the foundations do ioine on the part by the midst of 
the length of the nose, and on the other after the dayes. 
The subcartilaginous is double, one outward that maketh 
the tip of the nose, and the other inward deuideth 
the nosethrills. The nosethrills be two gutters ascending 
vnto the bone of the collatory where as are applicate 
the additions mamilares of the brayne whereas 
smell is and descending vnto the palaice nigh Lanulle, 
by the which chanells is drawen the fumous vaporation 
to the sayd places. And the ayre is breathed and respyred 
to the longes and the brayne is purged of superfluities. 
 
[}Question.}] Of what substaunce, forme, and what 
place, and for what cause were the eares made? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] First they are made of cartilaginous substaunce. 
Secondly, they are hollow of forme. Thirdlye, 
they are set on the petrous bones. And fourthly they be 
ordeyned to the hearing. 
 
[}Question.}] From whence commeth the hearing to 
the eares? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It commeth by the streight holes of the 
bones Petrous by meane of a sinewe that commeth 
to the eares that breedeth of the v. equalitie of sinues 
of the braine. 
 
[^f.17r^] 
[}Question.}] Whereoff serueth the glandinous flesh, 
that is vnder the eares? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] That they may be cleansers of the braine. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff serueth certeine veynes that 
are nigh by that place? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] After Lanfrankes intention, bicause they 
cary the matter sparmatike to the ballockes. And therfore 
if they be cut a man is neuer apt to generation. 
Neuerthelesse Galen holdeth the contrary, as Auicen 
reciteth in the treatie of the lynage. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff serue the temples, the cheekes, 
and the Iawes? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They be the parts of the sides of the 
face. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff are the cheekes, the temples, 
and the Iawes composed? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Of the musculous flesh with veynes, 
arteres, and bones. 
 
[}Question.}] How many muscles are there in the said 
parts and from whence come they? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] First there is vij. muscles that moue 
the lyppes and the cheekes, which after Auicen commeth 
from the forcule of the lower partes. After 
Haly there is also twelue that moue the nether 
Iawes, of the which some openeth it that come 
from the place of the part of the eares. And the other 
close it that descende from aboue in passing vnder the 
bayle of the bones of the temples, and those are called 
timporalles, and are right noble and verye sensible, 
and therefore their hurte is verye perillous, by the 
reason whereoff Nature hath wrought wisely for to 
saue them, and hath ordeined the bought of the temples 
bones, and the other muscles are made for to grinde 
and chaw, and those proceede of the ball of the cheekes. 
And to all these muscles commeth sinewes from the 
third parell of sinewes of the brayne. 
 
[^f.17v^] 
[}Question.}] Commeth there any veines or arteres 
with the sayd Muscles. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Yea, chiefly about the temples, & the corners 
of the eyes, and the lippes. 
 
[}Question.}] How many bones is there in the partes 
aboue sayd? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] There is many. For first there is nine 
bones of the cheekes, as Galen sayth, though there appeare 
but two that are ioyned vnder the nose. And 
then is there two parell that are called the bones of 
the temples, the which in making a parte of the orbitall, 
or eminent pomall that is rounde, bright apples of 
the cheekes, compassing the cheekes, producing an addition 
round about the addition of the bone petrous, 
& maketh the bought, vnder the which be conserued & 
kept the muscles of the temples. Then is there the neather 
Iawe bones whereoff Auicen sayth that the neather 
Iawe is composed of two bones, which be narrow 
vnder the chinne, and there are knit by an onely 
ioynt, and in the top of euery of the other extremities, 
in cutting is a boowed sarrature which is composed 
with an addition very subtilly made and bred there. 
The bones that come there are fastened with strings. 
 
[}Question.}] Of how many partes is the mouth composed. 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Of v.particles. The lippes, the teeth, the 
tongue, the roofe, and Encla. 
 
[}Question.}] From whence commeth it that the teeth 
haue feeling, seeing that bones feele not? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] Albeit that the teeth be of bony substance, 
neuerthelesse after Galen in the.xvj.booke of the vtilitie 
of particles, they feele by reason of certein sinewes descending 
from the third pareile of the sinewes of the 
braine that haue there their rootes. 
 
[}Question.}] How many teeth ought euery person to 
haue? 
 
[^f.18r^] 
[}Aunswere.}] Some haue more, and some fewer. In 
some is found .xxxij. xvi. in euery Iaw. And in other is 
found but .xviii. That is to wit, two donales, two quadruples 
.viii.molares, and two cassalles. And their roots 
are fixed within the Iawes, of the which some hath but 
one, and the other two, and some three, and other foure. 
 
[}Question.}] What is the tongue? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is a particle, fleshly, soft, and spongious, 
composed of many sinewes, stringes, veynes, and 
arteres for the tast, principally ordeyned, to speake and 
vtile to gouerne the meate in the mouth. 
 
[}Question.}] Whence commeth the mouing to the 
tongue, and the vertue of taste? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It commeth from the veines, tasting and 
mouing, that commeth from the .iiii. and .v. pareile of the 
sinewes of the braine. 
 
[}Question.}] Howe many muscles commeth to the 
tongue, and from whence come they? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] There commeth .ix. that breede of the adtion 
called sagitall, of the bone named Lapheoides. 
 
[}Question.}] Whereoff serueth the glandinous fleshes, 
that are vnder the tongue? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] They be ordeined for the mortifying of 
the tongue, for in the sayd fleshes is two oryfices, wherby 
the spetle issueth. And vpon the said fleshes, y=e= tongue 
is situate as vpon a mole hill. 
 
[}Question.}] Wheroff serueth the Encla and the amigdales, 
and faulses, and where are they set? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] First they serue to prepare the breth, and 
are set behinde the tongue toward the palaice. 
 
[}Question.}] What is the palaice? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] It is the highest place or roofe of y=e= mouth. 
 
[}Question.}] Wherewith is the palaice of the mouth 
couered with his partes? 
 
[}Aunswere.}] With a pannicle that breedeth out of the 
inside of the stomake.
