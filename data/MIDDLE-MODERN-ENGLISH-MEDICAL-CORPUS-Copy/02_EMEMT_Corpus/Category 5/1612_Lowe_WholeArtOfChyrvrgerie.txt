[}CHAP. I. 
Of the Causes, Signes prognosticke, and 
Cure of Wounds, in Generall.}] 
 
[}Interloqvutors. Peter, and Iohn.}] 
 
LIke as we have proceeded in the former Booke 
of Tumors, we shall follow out the same methode 
in Wounds, first demaunding of you 
what is a wound? 
 
[}Io.}] It is a solution of continuity, recent, 
[/1./] 
[^p.278^] 
bloody, without putrefaction, either in the soft, hard, or organicke 
[/2./] 
parts. 
 
[}Pe.}] What is the cause of wounds? 
 
[}Io.}] The Causes are diuers, and do happen diuers waies, 
by the which the wound taketh diuers denominations, as if 
[/3./] 
a wound be made by a thing sharpe pointed, as a Rapier, 
Launce, or Dart, it is called thrust or stobbe: if by a sword 
or any such thing that doe cut, it is called incision or cut: if 
of a heauy and blunt, as a stone, Bat, Clubbe, and such 
like, which are doone by force and violence, breaking and 
contunding the flesh, it is called contusion. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are the Signes of wounds? 
[/4./] 
 
[}Io.}] They be manyfest, according to the Iudgements and 
accidents that follow. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are the difference? 
[/5./] 
 
[}Io.}] Some are simple, others composed. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is a simple wound? 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is that wherein is no lacke of substance, and healeth 
[/6./] 
by one way onely, as sayth Hippocrates. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is a composed wound? 
 
[}Io.}] It is that in the which there is losse of substance, and 
hath diuers intentions for the cure thereof. 
 
[}Pet.}] Differ they no others waies? 
 
[}Io.}] They differ also in this, that some doe heale easily, 
others are difficile, some be mortall, some without intempery, 
some be little, others great, superficiall, profound in the 
simple or similar parts; others in the instrumentall or organicke 
parts; some do happen in soft, others in hard parts. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are those that heale easily? 
 
[/7./] 
[}Ioh.}] Those which are in the flesh, without incision of 
vaines, artiers, nerues, and in bodies well disposed. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are dangerous? 
 
[}Ioh.}] All those which are interne in the membraines of 
the braynes, in the loynes, in the bordes of Diaphragma, 
[/8./] 
great intestines, and those that are in the ioynts; also 
wounds in the nerues which cause convulsion, by reason of 
[^p.279^] 
their communication of the braynes: those in the Oesophag, 
[/9./] 
vaine Iugulares, flancke, thighs, betwixt the fingers, and 
such as are without tumor, all wounds in the head both 
[/10./] 
great and small, with such wounds as are deepe made ouerthwart 
the muscles. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are mortall? 
 
[}Ioh.}] All those in the substance of the braynes, heart, liuer, 
middest of the lights, chest of the gall, middest of the 
[/11./] 
Diaphragma, stomacke, melt, kidneyes, small intestines, 
bladder, matrix, trahe artier, and spynall medull; those 
which are in the rootes of the emunctories of the noble parts, 
also in the vaine descending or ascending, vaine port, great 
artier, or in the backe. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are the peculiar signes, whereby you know 
[/12./] 
those parts to be mortall? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Euery one haue their owne particular signe, as if 
the braynes or membraines thereof be hurt, the bloud commeth 
forth by the nose and eares, with vometing of choller, 
auoyding of the excrements vnawares, the face groweth 
vgly to the sight: the feeling and vnderstanding dull, with 
convulsion and rauing within three or foure dayes. I know 
the Heart to be hurt, when there commeth forth quantity 
of bloud, thicke and blacke, chiefly the right side being hurt; 
if the left, the blood is more red and subtill, the pulse becommeth 
weake and variable, pale colour, with vniuersall 
trembling, auoyding a cold euill sauoured sweat: the extremities 
wax cold, often sounding, and briefly death. I 
know the Loynes to be hurt, when the sicke doth breath 
with difficulty, voyding a spumous blood at the mouth and 
wound, also when the sicke lyeth on the wound, speaketh 
more freely then on the other side, with rauing, red colour, 
and hote in the visage, sometimes auoyding quantity of 
matter by the wound. The membranous part of the Diaphragma 
being hurt, the flancke doth retyre with great 
waight on the part, dolour in the ridge backe, difficulty to 
breath, coughing with issue of a spumous bloud at y=e= wound. 
[^p.280^] 
If the Liuer be hurt, there commeth out abundance of blood 
[/13./] 
at the wound, the flanckes retyre towards the backe, the 
colour like death, the eyes sincke in the head, want of rest, 
the vrine is bloudy, the excrements purulent, the sicke commeth 
to lye on the belly, the dolour is pricking, extending to 
the breastbone and ribbes, in respyring he draweth in his 
shoulders, and vomiteth choller. Paulus Ægineta reporteth, 
[/14./] 
that one lobe of the liuer may be hurt, and yet death not follow 
of necessity. If the milt be hurt, the bloud co~meth forth 
blacke and thicke at the wound or left flancke, which w~ the 
stomacke waxeth hard, there is great drought, dolour in the 
left side, also in the region of y~ liuer: if the kidneys be hurt, y~ 
dolor descendeth to y~ root of the thigh & testicles, w~ difficulty 
of vryne, pissing of bloud, sometime the bloud stayeth within, 
and the sicke becommeth all swollen, and so dyeth. If the 
oriface of the stomacke be hurt, there ensueth vomiting of 
choller, also of the meat and the drinke, the pulse groweth 
weake, extremities cold, often sweating. The intestine 
Ieiunum and stomacke being hurt, haue the same signes, 
[/15./] 
with the meat and drinke comming forth at the wound, the 
flancke dolorous and hard, voyding choller at the mouth, 
[/16./] 
the spittle blew, and extremities waxe cold. The Spynall 
medull being hurt, there happeneth convulsion and Paralisme, 
the feeling groweth remisse, the inferiour conduits 
are relaxed, so that the vryne and excrements voydeth away 
[/17./] 
unawares. The Bladder being hurt, there is great dolour 
on the sheere-bone and Ilya, pissing of bloud, voyding of the 
vryne at the wound, vomiting of choller, coldnesse of extremities. 
If the Matrix be hurt, the dolour doth communicate 
to the liskes, haunches, and thighs, the bloud commeth 
forth partly by the wound, and partly by nature: some 
loose sence, reason, and speech, and haue the same accident as 
those who are hurt in the heart. The Intestines being hurt 
[/18./] 
there is great dolour, with continuall voyding of the excrements 
at the wounds. 
 
[}Pe.}] What is to be considered in the Iudgeme~ts of wounds? 
 
[^p.281^] 
[}Ioh.}] First, to know what part is hurt and the nature 
[/19./] 
thereof, whether there be any hope of health, knowing the 
parts that are easie to heale, difficile, and mortall; also the 
vsage, action, substance, situation, the figure of the wound, 
actions that happen. The temperature, age, sex, region, 
season, and constituiton of the time, wounds in the nerues, 
tendons, ioynts, and bones, without appearance of tumor 
or euill signes, and sheweth the humor to haue taken the 
course to the noble parts. Hippocrates sayth, if in the wound 
[/20./] 
of the articles fluxe of the belly doth happen, it is euill, and 
for the most part mortall. Wounds with fracture behinde, 
are in danger of spasme, and such as are before are in danger 
of rauing and frenzie. If convulsion happen in a wound, 
[/21./] 
chiefly after great inflammation, it is for the most part mortall, 
and sheweth that the parts neruous are hurt. Wounds 
in the head, if after ten dayes symptomes doe happen, it signifieth 
abscesse in the liuer, and great drought signifieth the 
[/22./] 
same. Wounds with great losse of bloud, if convulsion ensue, 
are dangerous; as also all thrusts in the nerues and 
tendons, and in voluntary vometing of choller, or if the inflammation 
lasteth long, are all euill signes. 
 
[}Pet.}] Vntill what time should wee stay our iudgement of 
wounds in the head? 
 
[}Ioh.}] To fortie dayes, some late Writers till fifteene or 
[/23./] 
twenty dayes, after which time, often feuers and other euill 
accidents, which chaunceth often in time of full Moone, in 
which time I did see sundry dye. 
[/24./] 
 
[}Pet.}] What time of the yeare is most expedient for the 
curation of wounds? 
 
[}Io.}] The Spring time, the weather being neither hote nor 
cold: the Autume is worse, for the moystnesse of the ayre; also 
the Winter is enemie to all vlcers and wounds, in the 
[/25./] 
membraynes and bones. 
 
[}Pet.}] How many poyntes are there to be obserued in the 
[/26./] 
curation of wounds? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Fiue, in ordering of vniversall remedies, with good 
[^p.282^] 
regiment of life, and good ayre, which must be hote and temperate: 
[/27./] 
the sicke must be nourished with little meat and of 
light digestion, somewhat refrigeratiue. If there be feare 
of feuer and inflammation, which is most to be feared before 
the seauenth day, for the which abstaine from wine and all 
strong drinke, except through losse of much bloud the heart 
be faint, suppe lightly, and abstaine from women, and all violent 
passions of the mind. If great dolour, inflammation, 
[/28./] 
or convulsion happen, as in parts neruous and bare of flesh, 
let bloud, and use light purgations, if the body be Cacochimicke. 
In great wounds of the head, and such other times 
as is not meet to giue potions at the mouth, as you shall percieue 
[/29./] 
by the estate of the diseased, vse Glysters. The Second 
poynt, in taking away that which is noysome, as Iron, 
[/30./] 
Balls, any Stones, Wood, and such like, Cloth, peeces 
of bones, or congealed bloud. 
[/31./] 
 
[}Pet.}] By what meanes take you such things away? 
 
[}Ioh.}] They shalbe taken away either by the part where 
they enter, or parts whither they tend, which is doone by 
[/32./] 
diuers sorts of Instruments fit for that purpose: 
 
[^p.283^] 
[}Instruments to drawe bullets, arrowes, and 
other strange things, from woundes.}] 
 
[^An image of various, mostly plier-like, surgical instruments omitted.^] 
 
[^p.284^] 
also by the helpe of those medicaments, Radix pectinis veneris 
[/33./] 
cum malva tusa, aristolocia, ammoniacum, cum melle radix 
arundinis contusa melle mista altersi fructus, lacerti caput 
tritum & appositum, excepting alwayes if they be in some 
noble part, in which case they are not to be touched, because 
[/34./] 
it hasteneth death and helpeth not. Then we must consider 
if the thing be superficiall not past, yet the great vaines, artiers, 
and nerues, in that case they shall be drawen out by 
the wound: but if it passeth those great vessels, it shall bee 
drawen by the part where it tendeth to, by incision of the 
part, least in drawing of it by the wound, you hurt and dilacerate 
those vessels, which thing is most to be feared in broad 
Arrowes. By this forme the wound healeth more easily, 
and the medicaments may be applyed on both sides, as also 
the matter may auoyde more easilie: in making of the incision 
there is great care to be had, not to cut vaine, nerue, 
nor artier. If at the first those things may not be drawen 
out, they are to be let alone a certaine space: in the which 
time, the flesh that is about it doth consume and putrifie, so 
giveth a more easie passage. The late Practicioners are of 
[/35./] 
opinion to pull out all those strange things at the first, because 
then the patient feeleth not the sore so much as afterward: 
besides, shortly after the part doth swell through 
fluxion of humors, which maketh the wound narrow, accompanyed 
with great dolour, more than at first. For 
the extraction we scituate the sicke in such forme as when he 
was hurt, and seeke the strange thing, either with a sound 
or finger which is most sure, and draw it forth with the 
least paine that may be. If the wound be not great inough 
that it may not bee drawen with dilaceration of the flesh, 
[/36./] 
which maketh great inflammation and dolour, in that case 
we must dilate the wound with a Bystorie or Razour: for 
the which it is most necessary to know the forme, substance, 
situation and collection of euery part, with the symptomes 
which doe commonly follow: if that thing which you would 
draw, be in the bone, it must be drawen by a Tyrefond, 
[^p.285^] 
and shaken a certaine time afore, as counselleth Rollandus 
lib. 1. If the bone be much broken, we vse dilatation of the 
wound, both to draw those little bones more easily and consume 
the great: if without great paine the Bullet, Arrow, 
[/37./] 
or other thing cannot be found, and the sicke feele no great 
harme thereof, it is best to let it alone, till such time it sheweth 
[/38./] 
it selfe by the working and moouing of the nature. The 
third intention, we close the lips of the wound by bandages 
and sutures. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is Suture? 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is a ioyning of the parts separated against the 
course of nature, which in great wounds is doone by needle 
and threed, to the end the siccatrize be more sure: like as in 
great wounds of the thighes, legges, and armes, where 
there is great distance betwixt the bordes or brimmes of the 
[/39./] 
wound. If the part be altogether cut, and haue almost no 
hold whereby to receaue health, the suture auaileth not: also 
if the bordes of the wound be inflamed and tumified, no 
suture must be vsed till the inflammation be past, and the 
wound somewhat suppured: in doing whereof, it must neither 
be too slacke nor too straight. 
 
[}Pet.}] How many sorts of Sutures are there? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Diuers, according to the diuersity of the wound, 
hurt part, or nature of the body, and are commonly referred 
to three, to wit, Incarnatiue, Retentiue, and Conseruatiue. 
 
[}Pet.}] After how many wayes doest thou vse the Incarnatiue? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Fiue waies, first with a needle of reasonable length, 
[/40./] 
sometimes curbed, triangular at the poynt, with a soft 
strong round theed, to the proportion of the wound and needle: 
also the needle case must be holden on the other side of 
the wound to hold it steady, that the first stitch be in the outside 
of the wound, and hold the case on the hurt side, make 
your next stitch on y=e= hurt side of the border, & the case on the 
whole side, beginning alwayes your stitches in the middle 
[^p.286^] 
of the wound, taking reasonable great stitches in deepe 
[/41./] 
wounds, and superficiall in small wounds, ioyning the lips 
of the wound euenly and closely together, so knit the threed 
[/42./] 
and cut it neare the knot, then if need be put another stitch 
interspace betwixt, obseruing alwayes that the stiches be no 
neerer then an ynch one to another. 
 
[}Pet.}] How is the second done? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Either with a needle or diuers together, as if the 
[/43./] 
wound be great and deepe, and the thread not sufficient, we 
passe an other needle in the wound, as the president, yet not 
drawing it through, as doe women, when they sticke a needle 
in their sleeues, and turne the threed about it; and after 
this order, vse so many as shall be needfull, according to the 
greatnesse of the wound: and this kind of Suture we vse 
in clouen lippes, which shall bee done in this manner. If 
it be not great, and much dilated, and the person neither too 
yong, nor too old, nor of euill habitude, we take the lippe and 
cut all the skin of the inner side of the cleft with an instrument, 
then we passe one needle as abouesayd, or two if need 
be, with an emplayster of Betonica, or such like, which doth 
conglutinate the lippe commonly in ten dayes, after which 
time cut the thread, and take out the needle, and induce the 
ciccatrize, as in others: Doe the like in the eares, or nose 
being so clouen. 
 
[}Pet.}] How doest thou the third Suture Incarnatiue? 
 
[}Ioh.}] With long needles and strong thread, double, with 
an hard knot on the end, which we passe in diuers parts of 
the wound, leauing alwayes an ynch betwixt, then passe a 
[/44./] 
little round piece of wood the greatnes of a small Goose quill, 
in each side of the wound vnder the thread, and presse the 
lippes of it gently together, and knit the thread with double 
knottes one after another, vntill all be knit, which is vsed 
in great deepe woundes, that the stitches doe not breake 
or slippe. 
 
[}Pet.}] How is the fourth Suture Incarnatiue done? 
 
[}Ioh.}] By little peeces of Cloth, as the breadth of the 
[^p.287^] 
wound and place requireth, that is strong, with the seluedge 
cut in points like Arrowe heads, the rest shall bee couered 
with some astringent and conglutinatiue emplaster, as this, 
take powder of Sangue Dragon, Truboll, Incence, Masticke, 
[/45./] 
Socrocolla, fine flower, incorporate all with whites 
of Eggs, and lay on both sides of the wound with the aforesayd 
cloth, and the cloth be further backe than the lippes of 
the wound, so the poynts shall be neare to the sayd lippes or 
borders, which being fast, wee put a thread through these 
poyntes till such time as wee see the lippes of the wound to 
close, and knit the thread with a double knot, this is called 
the drye Suture, and is commonly doone in the face, and 
such places, where we desire the Cicatrize not to be seene. 
 
[^p.288^] 
[}Portraiture of a drie suture.}] 
[^Omitted a line drawing depicting a dry suture applied on the cheek of a woman and the equipment required.^] 
 
[}Pet.}] How doest thou the fift Suture Incarnatiue? 
 
[}Ioh.}] With claspes of Iron sharpe poynted, and long, 
which take lippes of the wound being put together, and 
hold them so: this was vsed by some old practicioners, but 
at this present it is not in vse, as be dolorous, and exciteth 
inflamation and fluxion. 
 
[^p.288^] 
[}Pet.}] How is the second kind of Suture generall done? 
[/46./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is doone after the manner that the Glouers sowe 
their gloues, but is neither sure nor profitable, for one point 
slipping, the rest slippe also. In like manner, the blood, which 
is retained, swelleth the part, and falleth amongst the muscles, 
which often doth rotte, and gangren the part: so it is 
better to knit the vaines and artiers, or cauterize them, 
which I haue doone with good successe, and was vsed by our 
Ancients where there was great effusion of blood in the 
vaines and artiers, and now commonly vsed in the intestines, 
stomacke, and bladder, and such other membrainous 
parts. 
 
[}Pet.}] How is the third Suture generall doone? 
[/47./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] As the rest, but not so hard, and is vsed to conserue 
the lippes of the wound being separated, and where there is 
great losse and dilaceration of flesh. 
 
[}Pet.}] What time appoint you to take away the poynts 
of your Sutures? 
 
[/48./] 
[}Ioh.}] According to the opinion of Vigo, in 6. or 8. dayes, 
yet in our ordinary practise we limit no time, for some conglutinate 
sooner than others, so when the part divided beginneth 
to conglutinate, assuredly we take out the stitches. 
 
[}Pet.}] Is there no other sort of Sutures commonly vsed? 
 
[}Ioh.}] There is a kind which we vse in the belly, called 
Gastroraphie, of the which diuers haue written in diuers 
manners, here I will set downe that which is sure and most 
[/49./] 
easie in the wounds of the belly. First, if the guttes come 
forth, they must be put in their place, also the caule, first knitting 
[/50./] 
and cutting away that which is altered, leauing the 
end of the ligatour out at the wound, that which falleth 
[/51./] 
may be drawen out, then thou shalt cause one to take both 
sides of the wound in his hand, then he shall discouer a little 
of the wound, so make the first stitch of the needle at the extreamity 
of one side of the wound pearcing the skinne and 
muscles, not touching the periton, thereafter put the needle 
in the other side through the periton, muscles, and skinne, 
[^p.290^] 
then make an other stitch, like to the first, not touching the 
periton, then make the fourth poynt like the second, pearsing 
periton, muscles, and skinne, so continue it till it be all 
sewed, taking the periton on the one side, and leauing it alwaies 
on the other. If the Epiplon be altered, cut it away, 
tye the rest in feare of fluxe of bloud, hold forth the one end of 
the threed till it fall off it selfe. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is a bandage, or ligatour? 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is a peece of cloth made long two or three elles, 
[/52./] 
and in breadth three or foure inches, according to the member 
and hurt, the cloth must be soft, cleane without hem or 
seame, and more slacke in wounds than in fractures, and of 
it there are diuers sorts; for some are to containe, as in simple 
[/53./] 
wounds; some are to expell matter, as we see in caue 
wounds; some are defensiues to stay fluxion; some to retaine 
the medicaments on the part, as in the throat and belly; 
some are mortificatiue, which we vse in legs or armes 
[/54./] 
gangrened, to cut them off. The way how these bandages 
should be vsed, are after diuers manners, according as you 
shall heare in their proper places hereafter. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which is the fourth poynt observed in curing of 
[/55./] 
Wounds? 
 
[}Ioh.}] To giue order to the accidents, which are double, to 
wit, proper and accidentall. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are proper? 
 
[}Io.}] Aposthume, Hemeragie, and Putrefaction. 
 
[/56./] 
[}Pet.}] What is Aposthume? 
 
[}Ioh.}] I haue set downe the definition, signes, difference, 
and cure thereof in the general Chapter of Aposthumes. 
 
[/57./] 
[}Pet.}] What is a Hemeragie? 
 
[}Io.}] It is an issuing of the bloud in great aboundance, the 
vaine or artier being cut, riuen, or corroded: there is another 
flux of bloud, which sometime commeth at the nose, and 
[/58./] 
chaunceth often in dayes criticke, which should not be stayed, 
vnlesse it be excessiue. 
 
[}Pet.}] How should the excessiue flux be stayed? 
 
[^p.291^] 
[}Io.}] By thinges about and on the place, which coole, aggliuate, 
and drie, by ligatours, cauters actuall, and such 
like, as I shall set downe in the Chapter of Wounds, with 
flux of blood. 
 
[}Pe.}] What is Putrefaction? 
[/59./] 
 
[}Io.}] It is that which corrupteth and letteth the spirit and 
naturall heat in the member, where-through it becommeth 
rotten and putrefied. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is the cause of this putrefaction? 
 
[}Io.}] Either corruption of the spirit vitall, or else viscous 
and cold humors, which stop the passage of the vitall spirit, 
some are causes primitiues as stroakes, contusion, straight 
binding, and such like. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are the accidentall causes? 
[/60./] 
 
[}Ioh}]. Euill complexion, feuer, dolour, spasme, paralisye, 
syncope, and alienation. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is euill complexion? 
[/61./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is an euill comixtion of the foure humors, when 
one raigneth more than another, as was sayd in the first 
Booke. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is feuer? 
[/62./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is an extraordinary heat, beginning in the heart, 
sent through all the body with the spirit and bloud, by the 
vaines and artiers. 
 
[}Pet.}] By what meanes is it cured? 
[/63./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is distinguished according to the time, cause, and 
nature, which points belong to the Phisition. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is Dolour? 
[/64./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is a feeling of a thing, which hath a contrary quality 
in our bodies. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is the cause of Dolour? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Solution of continuity, or some sodaine alteration; 
the accidents which come of it, as also the cure, is set downe 
in the generall chapter of Tumors, yet wee will say somewhat 
of it at this present. All dolour maketh alteration of 
[/65./] 
humors and bloud, which maketh inflammation, for the 
[^p.292^] 
which foment the place with oyle of Roses, with the white 
of an egge, if the dolour be great, stupifie the part with oyle 
of Poppie and Opium, with Mandrager, also the roote of 
Solanum brayed and put with the same, is good to mitigate 
the dolour, as sayth Galen: if it be not appeased by these 
[/66./] 
remedies, it is signe that the nerues are hurt, for the which 
haue recourse to the wounds in the nerues. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is Spasme? 
[/67./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is a malady in the nerues, making involuntary 
[/68./] 
moouing, drawing the muscles and tendons towards their 
beginning, vneasie to relaxe. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is the cause of spasme? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Repletion, evacuation, and dolour. 
[/69./] 
 
[}Pet.}] Is it dangerous? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Avicen siyth, that all spasme confirmed in wounds 
is mortall, others are curable: that which chaunceth 
through thrusts in the nerues is euill. If it happen by great 
euacuation of bloud, it is mortall, as sayth Hippocrates, and 
better it is, that a feuer come in a convulsion, then convulsion 
in feuer: spasme after feuers, is mortall, as saith Hipocrates? 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are the signes of spasme? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Difficile moouing of the body, tention of the necke, 
contraction of the lippes, astriction of the iawes, peruertion 
of the eyes and face, which, if it take the course to the parts 
appoynted for respiration, it is lamentable, and the sicke 
shall soone dye, that which is confirmed, is incurable. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is the cure of it? 
 
[}Ioh.}] First, in good dyet, with drie ayre, moderate sleepe, 
open belly, eschewing the passions of the mind, vsing corroboratiues, 
we foment the part with Hydrelion or Hydromell, 
sometime bathe with water wherein hath been sodden 
Mallowes, Althea, and Uiolets, extremities of Calues, 
Mutton, Goates, Lambes, and such like, with a certaine 
quantity of oyle: being taken out of the bath, rub the part 
[/70./] 
with oyle of Uiolets, sweet Almonds, Hennes grease, or 
[^p.293^] 
Mutton, also rubbe the necke, backe, and head, being rased, 
[/71./] 
with oyle of Lyllies, Uulpinum, Turpentine Phylosophorum. 
For the same purpose, dry perfumes are good; it shall 
[/72./] 
be good sometime to draw bloud on the same side, if there be 
plenitude with inflammation: if there be cacochymie, purge 
the body of the humors which abound: if the cause come 
of dolour, or some bite of a venomous beast, the dolour must 
be appeased, and apply on the sore, Treacle and ventosies, 
to draw out the venenosity. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is Paralisie? 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is a mollification, relaxation, or resolution of the 
nerues, with priuation of the moouing, whereof there is two 
kinds, vniuersall and particular. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is the vniversall? 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is that which occupyeth all the body sauing the 
head, and if it possesse the head also, it is called Apoplexie, 
which is another kind. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is the particular? 
[/73./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is that which possesseth one member onely, as the 
hands, feet, tongue, legges, and such like. 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are causes? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Some are interne, and some externe. Interne, as 
grosse humor, which moysten the nerues in the braines and 
marrow, which let the vitall spirit to passe. Externe, are 
wounds, incision, falls, strokes, contusion, aposthume, cold 
bandage, all outward things that may let the animall spirit 
to passe. 
 
[}Pet.}] Is it curable? 
 
[/74./] 
[}Ioh.}] All paralisies are difficile, by reason the nerues are 
destitute of their natural heat, which is the efficient cause of 
[/75./] 
curation, yet some are curable; when the nerue hath lost 
[/76./] 
the feeling and moouing, it is called Apoplexie; when it commeth 
to one side, it is called Resolution of the part. 
 
[}Pet.}] How is it cured? 
 
[}Ioh.}] By vniuersall and particular remedies; vniuersall, 
as purgations, Glisters, bleeding, good dyet, hote and drye; 
[^p.294^] 
particular, as emplaisters, linements, ventosies, cataplasms, 
fomentations, also the balme of Guydo, who couuselleth to 
apply ventosies in the beginning of the nerues. Togatius 
counselleth, a liquor set downe in additionibus Petri apponensis 
de scriptionis mesue, also to rubbe the neke, backe, and 
parts most offended, with vnguentum marciatum or agrippa: 
Or this, which was shewed to me by my well experienced 
friend Maister William Clovves, Chyrurgion Ordinary to 
Queene Elizabeth of worthy memorie, and is thus, Rec.

[}Pet.}] What is Sincope? 
[/77./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is a suddaine fall and decay of all the whole forces 
[/78./] 
of the body, and of all accidents it is the worst. 
[/79./] 
 
[}Pet.}] Which are the causes of it? 
 
[}Io.}] Great euacuation of bloud, intemperature of the noble 
parts, vehement passion of the spirit, feare, lacke of courage, 
rotten vapours, as happen in pestilent feuers, and all 
things that may intercept and destroy the vitall spirit. 
 
[/80./] 
[}Pet.}] What is the Cure? 
[/81./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] First, to encourage the sicke, speake little, giue him 
a little wine, cast water in his face, and hold vinegar at his 
nose: draw his extremities, and chiefly the finger, and rub 
the part affected with this? Rec. Olei costini, terebinthinæ

[^p.295^] 
quo vngatur nervorum origo? 
 
[}Pet.}] What is Alienation? 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is an inordinate perturbation of the mind, with 
diuersity of speech, whereof there are two kinds, proper, and 
accidentall: the proper, is that which we call madnesse: the 
accidentall, is that which we call rauing, as chaunceth in 
[/82./] 
hote feuers, and other maladies, wherein hote fewmes ascend 
to the head, or by hote and cold ayre, as sayth Avicen, 
also by putrefaction and venenosity of our meat and drinke, 
and is cured by diuerting the fumes with frictions and ligators 
of the extremities, vsing Glisters, and rubbing the head 
and necke with Oxyrodinum, and diuers other things 
which may be prescribed by the learned Phisition. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is the fift thing to bee obserued in curing of 
[/83./] 
Wounds? 
 
[}Ioh.}] To conserue the substance and the temperature of 
[/84./] 
the hurt part, and consolide the wound, which is doone with 
vnguents, emplasters, tents, plumations, and ye shall heare 
in particular. 
 
[}Pet.}] Tell mee some thing of Plumations, Tents and 
their vse? 
 
[}Ioh.}] Plumations are made of little peeces of cloth, the 
[/85./] 
threeds drawen out, or the peeces of cloth themselues, wooll, 
or towe, the pith of Elder tree, the haires of a Hare, Gentian. 
Of these, some are round, some are triangulars and 
quandrangulars, the Ancients giue them diuers denominators, 
either of the matter they were composed of, or of their 
forme: some are applyed dry, others wet in diuers liquors, 
as whites of Egges, wine, vinegar, or oyle, according to 
the disposition of the part we apply them vnto. Sometime 
[/86./] 
we apply many, otherwiles few, as the case requireth. The 
Tents are sometime made of cloth, otherwhiles of sponges 
or rootes of certaine Plants, Brasse, Lead, Siluer: some 
caue within, others not; of length and greatnes according 
to the hurt; some are euen, others crooked, yet alwayes 
round, and are vsed for diuers causes, as when wounds are 
[^p.296^] 
to be amplyfied or cleansed, also in caue wounds with losse of 
substance, in contused woundes, altered by the ayre, also 
when the wouud is afflicted with phlegmon or any other tumor 
against nature, also in wounds which some of byting, 
[/87./] 
for such wounds haue some venenosity. In wounds with 
corruption of bone. In all other wounds we vse not these 
things, but induce the siccatrize and consolide the wound. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is Consolidation? 
[/88./] 
 
[}Ioh.}] It is that which hath force to ioyne, consolide, and 
dry the wound, and maketh it like vnto the skin. 
 
[}Pet.}] What is Skinne? 
 
[}Joh.}] It is nothing else, but the flesh made dry and hard 
by the woorke of nature, and vertue of medicaments, and 
is like the other skinne, but not of the same nature in all 
points. 
 
[}Pet.}] There are many other things, which may be spoken 
generally of Wounds, which (for want of time) wee will 
referre till our next meeting: against which time I will 
bring with me in writing, my opinion of Wounds in particular, 
aswell made by Gun shot, as otherwise; and then 
we will entreate of Vlcers after the same manner. 
 
Vulnera cur metuis? miles cur martis & ignis? 
Omnis in his chartis tuta medela patet. 
 
[}CHAP. II. 
Of the curation of Wounds, and first of 
the wound in the flesh without losse of substance.}] 
 
I Haue spoken in the precedent Chapter, that wounds in 
the organicke parts receaue no curation; now according 
to your desire I will prosecute these which happen in similar 
or simple parts, beginning with the simple wounds in 
the flesh, which is without losse of substance, either with accidents 
or without. As for the causes, signes, and Iudgements, 
you haue heard sufficiently in the precedent Chapter: 
[^p.297^] 
but for the Cure, the simple wound in the flesh, healeth 
[/89./] 
by ioyning the lippes of it together and helpe of nature: yet 
[/90./] 
for the more assurance we vse to let it bleed a little, if it hath 
[/91./] 
not bled sufficiently already: next we dresse it with a cleane 
cloth or soft spunge, then we close, and put on it the white 
of an Egge with lynt, bind the wound, and stirre it not in 
two or three dayes; the white of the egge preserueth it from 
inflammation, heat, dolour and bleeding. If the wound 
[/92./] 
be great that it ioyneth not by the simple ligator, wee vse a 
suture, with pouders incarnatiue or retentiues, composed 
of Sanguis draconis, Thus, Masticke, Bolarmenie, wheat 
flower, all mingled with whites of Egges, and a little oyle 
of Roses, with lynt on it as before. Also a double cloth broader 
than the wound, wet with oyle of Roses and vinegar, 
binde it, and stirre it not for two or three dayes if accidents 
doe not chance; and being remooued, wash it with warme 
Claret wine, wetting plumations in the same wine, which 
haue the vertue to drye and comfort. If the wound be deepe 
[/93./] 
and these remedies not sufficient, we make a liquor of oyle 
[/94./] 
of Hypericon and Turpentine, with the yolke of an Egge, 
or a little of my balme set downe in the Chapter of Gunshot. 
I vse, especially following the warres, the digestiue 
made of yolkes of Egges hard roasted, and beaten with a 
[/95./] 
little oyle of Hypericon, Turpentine, and Myrrhe, so this 
keepes a long time, and bringeth the wound to matter, the 
which not auoyding for the scituation, which is to high, we 
scituate the part in such sort, that the oriface is lowest, as for 
example, if the wound be in the thigh, and there be a cauity 
in the knee, wee situate the knee in such sort, that is much 
[/96./] 
higher than the thigh, if it auoyde not that time, and the cauitie 
be great, we make incision in the bottome of the cauitie, 
or cut it altogether. Thou mayest know which of those 
[/97./] 
issues is best by the greatnesse of the wound and nature of 
the part, it shall be best to make it in the bottome of the cauity, 
[/98./] 
vsing a hollow tent in it to auoyde the matter. We 
vse also a seton, which is a little cord or peece of cloth, rolled 
[^p.298^] 
in forme of a cord, annoynted with some liquor mundificatiue, 
[/99./] 
drawing it sometime from one issue to another, and so 
continuing till it be cleansed, dressing it twice a day, thereafter 
I vse some glutinatiue medicine, as you shall heare in 
the next Chapter. 
 
[}CHAP. III. 
Of the composed Wound with losse 
of Substance.}] 
 
THE composed Wound is when there is losse of substance, 
[/100./] 
to wit, skinne, flesh, and bones: for the Cure 
[/101./] 
we vse two intentions, that is, reparation of the substance 
[/102./] 
lost, and induction of the siccatrize: that which is lost, if the 
body be well disposed, it is repaired by nature onely, vsing 
[/103./] 
in the meane time medicaments that are cleansing and drying. 
If the flesh renue not in his fashion, we vse medicaments 
sarcotickes, which shall be made of Iris of Florence, 
Thus, Masticke, Aloe, Colaphonie, Pix resnia, Farnia, Hordei, 
Orobi, Fenugreci, Lupinorum, Apopanax, Mirrha, Sacrocolla 
and sanguinis draconis with vnguentum aureum mesue. 
If the wound be deepe, mix some of these pouders with 
Wine, and wash the wound with Turpentine in forme of 
vnguent, and put it in the wound either with plumations 
or tents, dresse it twice a day in Sommer, and once in Winter, 
vsing an emplaster that dryeth and comforteth with 
bandages. In these wounds there are foure intentions to 
be obserued; first, to ingender such substance as is lost, secondly, 
to know the temperature of the body and hurt part, 
to the effect, wee may iudge, whether the medicaments 
should be cold, hote, or drye; thirdly, to know the accidents 
[/104./] 
which happen to the sore; fourthly, the region, ayre, and 
way of life. The wound being filled vp, we induce the siccatrize 
with epuloticke medicaments, as red Desiccatiue, 
Album Rasis, Cerusse, Plantine, also to wash the wound 
[^p.299^] 
with wine, wherein hath been sod Balust and Allom, or this 
[/105./] 
emplayster. Rec. Tuthiæ preparatæ, plumbi crudi, antimoni 
crudi, corticis mali granati, balustorum, nucum gallarum, boli 
armenici, sanguinis draconis an. drag. 1. accipiantur omnia simul 
cum vnguento epompholigos vnc. 3. fiat magdaleon bone 
[/106./] 
consistentiæ, you shall find diuers other remedies set downe 
by Holler. Take heede that the siccatrize bee neither high, 
lowe, hard, soft, nor inequall; the high happeneth, when 
it is not dryed enough, and must bee mended by scarrifications, 
medicaments, cateretickes, and corrosiues; the low, 
contrarywise commeth through lacke of some peece of bone 
or too much drying, and is helped onely by frictions; the 
inequallity commeth through the poynts of the needles, 
[/107./] 
which hath beene ouer thicke and ill doone, and is helped by 
medicaments, emollients, discutients, and astringents. 
 
[}CHAP. IIII. 
Of the contused Wound.}] 
 
THe contused Wound, to the which chaunceth great accidents, 
[/108./] 
according to the Instrument it is doone with, 
is a kind of solution of continuity, made with a bruise, and 
is called by Gallen & some late writers Echymosis, in Greeke 
[/109./] 
Thasma and Nygma, in Latine Atricis, and Contusio; in 
the which there is separation and dilaceration of the flesh 
and muscles thereof, with great quantity of blood, and differeth 
somewhat from attrition as sayth Avicen, for contusion 
[/110./] 
happeneth in the fleshy parts, and attrition is doone in 
the heads and ends of the muscles. The Signes are like 
[/111./] 
vnto other wounds, with inequallitie and roughnesse in the 
flesh and skinne, diuersity of figure, according to the diuersity 
of the cause, the part and parts about are blacke and liuide, 
by reason of the blood which is out of his place and remayneth 
in these parts, and cannot be euacuated by sensible 
or insensible transpiration, but by suppuration. The Iudgements 
[/112./] 
[^p.300^] 
shall bee according to the greatnesse of the hurt, for 
great contusions are dangerous, for the corruption of the 
member, and consequently the body also. As for the Cure, 
[/113./] 
there are foure intentions, first, to stay the flux, if the contusion 
be with wound, as oft happeneth; but if without 
wound chiefly in the head, I vse only oyle of Wax, or new 
Wax it selfe applyed in forme of playster: next to stay the 
fluxion of humors on the part by euacuation, as purgations, 
bleeding, ventosing, ligatours, frictions, good regiment 
in vnnaturall things: thirdly, in vsing particular remedies, 
[/114./] 
first digestiues, for such woundes must suddainly bee 
[/115./] 
brought to suppuration, for the which, vse this cataplasme 
of Mallowes, Violets, Althea sodden in fresh broth, putting 
to it a little Barly flower, Butter, Basilicon, and the 
yolkes of Egges, with a digestiue: Or this, take Waxe, 
[/116./] 
Turpentine, Calues grease, Goosegrease, Hony, Myrrhe, 
oyle of Roses, mingle all together. To appease the dolour, 
vse oyle of Cammomill, Roses, Lyllies, Myrtles, Oxyrodin, 
and Bolarmenie. The fourth intention is, in correcting 
of the accidents, as dolour, Aposthume, Gangren, for 
which vse such remedies as you haue heard in the second 
Booke. The wound suppured, and the accidents corriged, 
[/117./] 
it must be cleansed with hony of Roses, and Turpentine, 
Mundificatiue de appio Apostolorum, and such like, as you 
shall heare in the last Booke. Being cleansed, we vse incarnatiues, 
and desiccatiues, as was set downe in the former 
Chapter. 
 
[}CHAP. V. 
Of Wounds doone by Gun-shot.}] 
 
I Haue spoken of simple, compound, & contused wounds, 
[/118./] 
now will I entreat of wounds with dilaceration and losse 
of soft and hard parts, and is made by diuers sorts of Instruments, 
as bullets of Lead, Iron, steele, Brasse, stones, 
[^p.301^] 
and other such like matter in diuers figures, as round, triangular, 
quadrangular, pointed, flatte, little, and great, 
which sometime penetrate, sometime not, whereof out Ancients 
haue made no mention, except onely Celsus lib. 7. 
cap. 5. who telleth not with what Instrument they were 
shot with; therefore though some haue written of late, yet 
because they are of diuers opinions, and written in sundry 
languages, I will shew my opinion touching the same, not 
making any mention of others who haue written of the 
[/119./] 
same. These kind of wounds are accompanyed with tumor, 
dilaceration of flesh, vaines, artiers, nerues, tendons, 
ligaments, and boanes, superficiall, profound; otherwhiles 
through the body, and according to the difference, the 
Chyrurgion must take his indication to diuersifie the remedy: 
in like manner, aposthume, dolour, corruption of the parts 
gangrened, and mortified through the great aboundance 
of bloud, dispersed betwixt the muscles: also for the 
dissipation of the naturall heate, sometime one onely accident, 
otherwiles diuers together, for the which we vse two 
curatiue intentions, to wit, restitution of such things as are 
lost, and to conioyne the parts diuided. These wounds come 
indifferently to all parts of our body whereof there are diuers 
opinions; some thinke that there is venenosity in the 
powder, and burning in the bullet, which is false, for the 
things whereof the powder is ordinarily made, as Brimstone, 
Saltpeeter, coales of diuers sorts of trees, Water, 
Wine, and Aquauite, haue no venenosity in them; likewise 
there is not burning in the bullet, for if the bullet of 
[/120./] 
lead being shot a great way, should burne, through heat 
would be melted it selfe. I haue cured diuers within these 
thirty yeares of diuers nations, which haue followed the 
warres in Fraunce, and other Cuntries, in the which I 
haue found no more difficulty then in other contused 
wounds: so I thinke these accidents come onely by contusion 
and dilaceration of the flesh, and not by any venenosity, 
or, vstion: yet there may become extraordinary mixtion 
[^p.302^] 
in the powder, which causeth venome, for the which wee 
take some other indication, according to the thing. The 
Causes, Signes, Differences, and Iudgements, are not 
much different from those of other wounds set downe, and 
sufficiently discoursed in the generall Chapter; as for the 
Cure there are fiue intentions; first, to drawe the ball; secondly, 
[/121./] 
to appease the dolour; thirdly, to cause suppuration; 
[/122./] 
fourthly, in mundifying generation of flesh and consolidation; 
fiftly, in correction of the accidents. As touching 
the first and second, to draw out the bullet and appease the 
dolour, I haue discoursed at length in the generall Chapter, 
neuerthelesse, because in these wounds there is vehement 
dolour, which weakeneth the sicke, hindereth nature, causeth 
[/123./] 
fluxion, letteth suppuration, and consumeth the flesh 
[/124./] 
which is contused; I will set downe things more particularly 
for the appeasing thereof, in changing the temperature 
of the whole body, in due vsage of the six vnnaturall things, 
by purgations, bleeding, and abstaining from things which 
cause dolour, as great tents, sections, straight bandages, 
wrong situation of the part, incision, vnlesse there be great 
neede. The topicall remedies, as cataplasmes with bread, 
milke, yolkes of egges, and little Saffron, also Mallowes 
sodden and beaten with wheat flower, oyle of Roses, Hogs 
grease, and Saffron, are good: Or this, Rec. Sanguis draconis, 
boli armenici, an. vnc. 1. pulueris rosarum & mirtilorum 
an. vnc. di. aceti vnc. 1. abumina ouorum quatuor, olei rosacei 
quantum sufficit, fiat vnguentum. If there be great heat, oyle 
of Roses, with whites of Egges and Uinegar, layd about, 
and on the part, is good. Also cerat Galen, or vnguent. rosat. 
mesues, with bol armenie, Sanguis draconis, pouder of Roses, 
and Myrtles. If we feare inflammation, which oft chanceth 
till the seauenth day, vse the same remedies and shift 
them twice or thrice a day. The tents shall be soft, wet in 
Turpentine, with a little oyle of Hypericon & Aquauite, 
according to the nature of the part, and vse this remedie hot, 
and continue it till the inflamation be past, let the sicke eat 
[^p.303^] 
and drinke little, that he ingender no superfluities. Avicen 
counselleth to giue meate to the sicke onely for sustentation 
of nature, abstayning from wine, for it is enemie to all 
wounds, drinke sodden water with Sugar, or Honey, or 
ptysane, till the inflammation be past, keepe rest and quietnesse, 
abstayning from all actions of the spirit, watching, & 
women, according to the disposition and nature of the hurt. 
[/125./] 
The third intention consisteth in medicaments suppuratiues, 
which must bee done with speed, to the end, they be 
[/126./] 
lesse subiect to inflammation, vsing remedies which are of 
[/127./] 
quality hote and dry, with vertue to correct the putrefaction, 
and let the Gangren and mortification of the part: there 
are of diuers formes; the simples are made of oyle of Hypericon, 
yolke of Egges, Lynt-seede, Lillies, Turpentine, 
Myrrhe, and such like: Or this, Rec. Terebinthine vnc. 2. 
corticis thuris drag. 1. mastichis drag. 3. olei hypericonis, & 
rosarum an. parum, vitellum vnius oui fiat medicamentum. Or 
this, which I most commonly vse of Hypericon, Turpentine, 
and yolkes of Egges, or my balme which is excellent 
in all kinds of wounds, made thus, Rec. summitatum & 
florum scrophularie & hypericonis an. quantum volueris, offioglossi, 
vel herbe carpentariorum & consoludæ regis. an. quantum 
volueris, terebinthinæ venetæ, quantum sufficit, macerentur in 
sufficienti quantitate olei hypericonis, insolentur omnia in sole 
calidissimo spatio 40. dierum in vase plumbeo, vel vitreo duplicato, 
postea fiat fortis expressio, seruetur liquor probalsamo. The 
fourth intention is to mundifie and regenerate that which 
[/128./] 
is lost, which must be done with things that haue little or no 
mordication, or sharpenesse, according to the nature of the 
part, as this, take sirupe of Roses, Violets, Fumetarie, 
Wormewoode, Honie of Roses, vnguent de apio, apostoloru~ 
fuscum egiptiacum: Or this, take Turpentine, honie of 
Roses, Iris of Florence, Barly flower, Succi apij of each 
a little, and make an vnguent. If there be great putrefaction, 
and the matter in great aboundance, vse this. Rec. Terebinthine

superfluitie, we vse for the regeneratio~ of flesh, vnguentu~ aureu~, 
basilicon maius, emplastru~ de betonica, diapalma, tetra, pharmacum. 
gratia dei, oleum mastichini & absinthij, mixe therewith 
a little flower of Barley, Lupines, and Orob, with 
Thus, Myrrhe, Masticke, And Aloes. Sometime we vse 
[/129./] 
in these sortes of wounds, a certaine drinke called potion vulnerar, 
wherewith wee wash the wound, and is thus made,

make a decoction in water and aromatize it with Cinamond, 
Honey or Sugar, drinke of it twise or thrise a day as it is 
needefull, and also thou maist wash the wound, putting 
thereto a little honye of roses or sirope of roses. The wound 
being filled with flesh, it must be dried with medicaments 
epupoloticks which by their astriction and drying do harden 
the flesh, and make a substance like to skinne, as vnguentum 
desiccatiuum rubeum diapompholigos, album rasis, dia calcitios, 
triapharmacum, cerusse de minio, mixing therewith galbanum 
acasia, sarcocollaplumbum & æs vstum, allumen, calx lota, and 
such like. The fift intention is in correcting the accidents, 
[/130./] 
which are diuers and great, for some come by accidents, 
or some are sharpe feeling of the parte hurt, as dolour, inflamation, 
convulsion, feuer,and such like, some come through 
violence of the bullet, as exctinction of the naturall heat of the 
part, hemoragie, dilaceration, contusion of the nerues, fractures 
of the bones, and some by the ignorance of the Chyrurgion; 
for the which cause he must be diligent, to stop such 
accidents, and if they happen, to helpe them with speed. 
 
[^p.305^] 
[}CHAP. VI. 
Of burning with Gun-powder.}] 
 
IT happeneth oftentimes in Armes that men are neere 
shot, & sometimes in handling of powder, or by fyring of 
flaskes which often chanceth, by the which ensueth great accidents; 
in so much that the affected part by the violence of 
the fire is altogether destitute of the proper humidity, and 
dryeth vp in such sort, that it maketh an escharre in the 
skin and flesh, chiefly if the shot or pouder be neere vnto the 
part. As for the Cure of the which, the Chyrurgion should 
[/131./] 
with all possible diligence remooue the intemperature which 
[/132./] 
chiefly consisteth in the softning of the escharre, and may be 
done two wayes; the one, by topicall remedies and digestiues, 
which doeth not too much heat, nor hath the verture 
to inflame. The other is done with such medicaments as 
[/133./] 
haue the vertue to pacifie the paine and preserue from putrefaction; 
such medicaments must be applied about the wound 
and on the escharre with Cotton, Lynt, or pieces of cloth 
trampled in those medicaments made of two yolkes of egs, 
beaten with oyle of Roses, some Barly flower, and a little 
[/134./] 
Bolarmenie. It shall be necessary to put a double linnen 
cloth about the wound, sopt in oyle of Roses, and yolkes of 
egges beaten together, take not away the escharre with violence, 
but let it fall off it selfe, which done and the paine pacified, 
you shall mundifie, cleanse, incarnate, and siccatrize 
the wound, as in others you haue heard: for this purpose 
I haue often vsed this vnguent, which doth heale without 
any marke, as thus. Rec. Albumen ovorum numero duo tuti 
alexandrini calcis viuæ nouies lotæ vnc. 2. ceræ recentis, vnc. 1. 
misceantur cum oleo rosaceo, quantum sufficit, fiat vnguentum: 
Or this, which I did learne of an old Parisian Priest, who 
vaunteth himselfe to be very expert in healing any kind of 
burning by this liquor; take sixe or eight Neats feet, bruise 
[^p.306^] 
them well, and boyle them in water, till they be all consumed, 
then take the grease of them and put in a glasse in 
the Sunne, or before the fire in Winter, powre out the water 
if any be, couer it close and keepe it, of the which you shall 
put vpon a linnen cloth, and apply to the sore. Remooue not 
the cloth untill it be whole, but only annoynt it euer being 
drye with a Goose quill, so it shall bee whole in short space 
without marke: Some doe vse for this purpose oyle of 
Linget or small water, also sheepes doonge fryed with hogs 
grease till it be dissolued, adding thereto a little veriuice, passe 
it though a cloth and annoynt the burnt part. 
 
[}CHAP. VII. 
Of Wounds in the vaines and artiers.}] 
 
HAuing spoken of the wounds in the flesh, in like manner 
you shall heare of them in the vaines and artiers, 
either with losse of substance, or without losse, which are accompanyed 
with great flux of blood, which happeneth when 
[/135./] 
the orifice of the vaine is opened, and is done by incision and 
imbecillity of the veines, abundance of bloud, or some sharpe 
quality, and when their tunicks are diuided, contused, and 
pearced, or else when the blood goeth through the veines, as 
[/136./] 
the sweat through the skinne, the tunicks and membraines 
are diuided by some externall cause, as contusion, ryding, 
shooting, falles in diuers manners. The Signes are these, 
[/137./] 
if the fluxe be of the artier, or vaine; of the artier, the blood 
[/138./] 
commeth leaping out subtilly red and hote. If it be more 
grosse, blacke, and thicke, and not leaping, it proceedeth of 
the vaines, as saith Avicen. The Iudgements are, if the 
[/139./] 
bloud come out in great aboundance it is dangerous, chiefly 
[/140./] 
when there is either convulsion, skinne, sounding, belching, 
or rauing; if it be not stayed, it causeth death, because it is 
the treasue of life. As for the Cure, there are two intentions, 
[/141./] 
the first to stay the blood, the second to conglutinate the 
[/142./] 
[^p.307^] 
wound; the bloud is stayed by filling vp the wound with 
[/143./] 
dry lynt, and aboue it an astringent or cloth wet in vinegar; 
if that stay it not, remooue the lynt often and wet it in Uinegar; 
which stauncheth it much: For these things cold and 
mordicant, stay fluxe of bloud in the wounds: or make this 
medicament of bol armenie, sanguis draconis, thuris, aloes, of 
[/144./] 
each like quantity, mixe them with the white of an egge and 
[/145./] 
the haires of an old Hare cut small, thereafter bind it reasonable 
straight, wetting the bands, clothes, and all about it 
in oxycrate, touch it not in foure dayes, in touching remoue 
all very softly, if it sticke to, humect it with oyle, whites of 
Egges, or wine. Some to stay blood, put this powder, in 
the wound, which I haue sometime vsed, viz. mans blood 
dryed with burnt cloth, wherewith thou shalt fill the wound 
full; some apply ventosies, frictions, ligators, on y~ parts opposite, 
some hold their thumbe long on y~ mouth of the vain, 
[/146./] 
which is a good remedie, for the bloud coniealeth in the vaine 
and so stancheth. If for all these remedies it stancheth it 
not, we apply on the vaine or artier a little lint wet in vinegar 
with a little pouder of Uitreoll, otherwise we knit them 
as was taught in the Chapter of Aneufrisme: if that cannot 
bee doone, we cauterize them with hote Irons, taking 
heede to touch the parts neruous. Shelander counselleth 
[/147./] 
the gumme Leminium sodden in Rennish wine, which 
hath many vertues, for it digesteth, mundifieth, incarnateth, 
and is good in wounds of the head, as saith Matheolus. 
[/148./] 
If none of these staunch flux of blood, especially in the vaines 
iugulars, I haue sometimes applyed a little astringent the 
breadth of the wound, and holden my finger a day or two 
vpon it, by which meanes I haue cured diuers: if it be in the 
matrix, intestines, or bladder, it shall be stayed by iniections 
of iuyce of Plantine, or some astringent powders infused 
in astringent decoction, and such like, the blood being stayed, 
the wound is healed as others, hauing regard to the part, 
for as the vaine is more drye than the flesh, and more soft, 
than the artier, so it must haue contrary remedies: in like 
[^p.308^] 
manner the wound in the artier is harder to be healed, than 
that in the vaine. Sometime there commeth such fluxe of 
bloud at the nose, that it is hard to staunch, for the which 
take an ounce of Boll, the Barke of Pomgranet tree, Balust, 
and galles, of each three drammes, seed of white Poppie 
two drams, incorporate all together with the white of 
an Egge and Uinegar, and applye on the temples and nose, 
if by this the violent flux doe not stay, take foure graines of 
my Requies, which infallibly stayeth all fluxes; otherwise 
[/149./] 
follow forth such things as are set downe in the Chapter of 
Flux of bloud at the nose. 
 
[}CHAP. VIII. 
Of wounds in the Nerues, Tendons, 
and Ligaments.}] 
 
CUttes and thrusts in the nerues chance in diuers parts 
of our bodie, and in diuers manners according to the instrument 
[/150./] 
it is done with, some are simple, others composed 
superficiall, profound, according to the diversity, of the 
[/151./] 
which we must diuersifie the remedy. The Causes ye haue 
[/152./] 
heard in the generall Chapter. The Signes are knowen by 
offending of the moouing and feeling, and by the vehement 
dolour, which causeth fluxion, feuer, spasme, rauing, inflamation 
[/153./] 
and fluxion on the nerues. The Iudgements are, 
that all wounds in the parts neruous are daungerous, for 
[/154./] 
the great communication they haue with the braines, and 
the nerue halfe cut, is more dangerous and dolorous, than 
if it were all cut, which if so be the action of the member doth 
[/155./] 
decay or at the least some part thereof: also wounds in the 
ioynts are for the most part mortall, because of the Aponeufrasis, 
of the Tendons and membraines that they are couered 
and knit with; so euill accidents doe happen, chiefly being 
profound. As for the Cure, if the body be full of humors, 
purge and let bloud, with quiet lying and strict dyet, 
[^p.309^] 
if the nerue be thrust, beware of putting to it any medicines 
conglutinatiues, but first of all some gentle remedies to appease 
the dolour, hold the wound open: if it be narrow and 
[/156./] 
deepe, incise it that the matter may passe more easily, then 
put in the wound a medicament that heateth and dryeth, to 
[/157./] 
wit, oyle of Hypericon, Turpentine of Venice, Aquauite, 
and a little Euphorbe, some put to the Turpentine and oyle 
of Hypericon, a little quicke sulphure, rubbe the about with 
oyle of Sage, Turpentine, and Annieseeds, which must be 
reiterated twice or thrice euery day. If there be putrefaction 
or inflammation, vse a cataplasme made of Barly meale, 
Lyntseed, Oreb sodden in Sapa, Uinegar, or Oximell: 
sometimes commeth picking of the nerue in the armes by 
[/158./] 
bleeding, for the which vse this set downe by Mesues. Take 
two ounces of oyle of Oliue, of salt two ounces, seeth them 
together, and put to it oyle of Turpentine, and put it hotte 
in the wound: if dolour happen, it shall be appeased as ye 
haue heard in the generall Chapter: if convulsion, rubbe 
the head, necke, backe, and vnder the armes, with oyle of 
Lillies, Bayes, costini & lumbricorum, Hennes grease, 
Calues marrowes, vnguent de althea: if the nerue be cut 
in length and appeareth to the sight, abstaine from all sharpe 
remedies, as Euphorbe, vse Diapampholigos dissolued in 
[/159./] 
oyle of Roses. Also this remedy of honie dissolued in oyle 
of Roses, Waxe, a little Turpentine, all which remedies 
[/160./] 
must be applyed warme. If there bee much matter in the 
wound, dresse it softly with bombast, or washed with sweet 
wine, and lay on it the emplayster Triapharmacon or Eneapharmacon. 
If the nerue be cut overthwart, there is great 
danger of convulsion and inflamation, for the fibres which 
are cut, communicate with th vncut. For the Cure of the 
which, rest, keepe dyet, and draw bloud, with such other remedies 
as ye haue heard. If the nerue be contused, and the 
[/161./] 
skinne also, and vlcered, it requireth a medicament drying, 
and binding the parts disioyned, made of Oximell, flower 
of Beanes and Oreb sodden together, putting therto a little 
[^p.310^] 
flower of Eruy, also to rubbe the part with oyle of Roses, 
and the white of an egge, thereafter foment the wound with 
warme wine. If the nerue be contused without offence of 
the skinne, rubbe it with oyle of Camomill, Iris, and Rue. 
If the tendons be hurt, which is a substance mixed with 
nerues and ligaments, they have the same cure that nerues 
have, but the medicament must be more strong and dry. If 
[/162./] 
y~ ligaments be hurt, which are like the nerues & tendons, it 
requireth a stronger medicament, for they have little feeling, 
[/163./] 
not communicating with the braines, they proceed from 
the bone, and goe to the bone, so any medicament drying 
may be vsed without offence: thereafter fill vp the flesh, 
and consolide the wound, as others.
