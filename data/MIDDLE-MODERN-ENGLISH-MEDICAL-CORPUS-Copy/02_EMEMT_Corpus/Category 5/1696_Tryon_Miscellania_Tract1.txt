[^p.8^]

Days together more or less, as you see 
Occasion; the like Method you are to 
observe, If you would purge your 
self with Carrots, Turnips and Parsnips, 
as you did with Herbs, with 
this Variation, viz. Drink your Gruel 
and Eat your Bread Mornings and 
Nights, and at Dinner, Eat only Carrots; 
Parsnips or Turnips, boyled only 
in good Water, and Eat them freely 
with no other thing but a little Salt and 
Bread, during these several Days, you 
[^p.9^] 
may Purge your self to what degree 
you please. 
 
[}Another way to Purge by Food's and 
Drinks.}] 
 
Drink in the Morning at several 
times, three Pints or two Quarts of thin 
Watergruel, at Dinner drink a Pint or 
a Quart, at Night drink a Quart more, 
and Eat some Bread. This Method 
will Purge, or at least will keep your 
Body open, let your Foods at Dinner 
be what it will, the Body being kept

Various Diseases in hot costive constitutions. 
 
[}An excellent Poultis against the Headach 
Pain in the Side, also a rare Remedy 
against the disease called St. Anthonies 
Fire.}] 
 
Take sage, Parsley and Balm, of each 
a like quantity cut small, one Quart of 
Rain or River Water, one Pint of 
Whitewine, three Ounces of white Sugar, 
two Ounces of Coriander Seed beaten, 
as much good Bread as will make 
it fit for a Poultis; mix them and stir 
[^p.10^] 
them over the Fire till they are boyling

Wound with this Sugared Spirit very 
well, then take a small quantity 
of the fine Powder of Refined Sugar, and 
put into the said Wound, and presently 
sow it up with a fine Needle and 
Silk, the quicker you do it, the better 
will the Cure be performed, for the more 
the Air is kept out of it the better: If this 
Method be observed, it will do wonders; 
the way of tenting is generally 
pernicious and prolongs the Cures of 
the above mentioned hurts, keeping the 
Parts from closing or cementing, for 
this prevents the stowing of the Humours, 
[^p.11^] 
and putrefaction and Nature does her 
own work without trouble cost or pain. 
 
[}Pithagoras's Method and Advice to his 
Disciples, viz.}] 
 
Whenever they had Occasion to 
make any Medicine, Poultis, Plaisters, 
Decoctions of Herbs, or any other 
thing, they were always to be mindful to 
take of those things that their Genius 
did first dictate to them, and not only 
the Herbs or Seeds grains or other 
things, but likewise the number of their 
Composition, that is, how many ingredients 
they were to mix together, the 
manner form and postures they were to 
observe in gathering of them, also what 
Words, Invocations and Prayers they 
use, also naming the name of the Person 
they operate for, expressing in 
words for whom they do it, for to 
Cure such, or such a Disease. And if you 
would know more of this, Read Pythagoras's, 
Letters (lately Printed by T. Sowle, 
in White Ha~rt-Court) and observe the 
Methods and Numbers there treated off 
at large, and your understanding will 
be enlightened, if you are in good earnest, 
and live in the Fear and under the 
Dominion of the Fountain of Benignity 
[^p.12^]

Simplicity and Innocency.

Wormwood Smokt in Pipes, being 
well dryed in the Sun, and Bagg'd in 
Paper close, is far better and more available 
for the help and Cure of all, 
or most of the Diseases, Tobacco is taken 
in Pipes for. 
 
[}A method how any Person may supply 
the place of Hops with Wormwood to all 
intents and purposes, and please the pallets 
of the Drinkers, for Wormwood 
[^p.20^] 
is an Excellent Herb, and of far greater 
Strength, Power and Vertue then 
Hops, provided it be gathered in it's 
proper Season and dried in the Sun, and 
bagg'd up as Hops are, so keep them for 
use, according to the Directions in our 
way to Health long Life and Happiness, 
viz.}] 
 
Take what quantity you think fit 
of dryed Wormwood, as you have occasion 
to keep your Drink a longer or 
a shorter time, and put it into your 
hot Water, in your Mash-Tub or Vessel, 
and then presently put your Mault in, 
and stir it together as is usual, and 
when it has stood the common time, 
draw it off, then you must take the 
Wormwood out, and add some fresh 
to your Liquor that you put up the 
second time, and do the like when you 
put up your third Liquor, if you mash 
more than twice; by this Method or 
way you will only extract the thin 
fine saline Vertues of the Herb, and 
leave the Gross Churlish bitter behind, 
and Drink thus made, doth not only 
Drink pleasant and keep well but is 
far more wholsome, and healthy than 
[^p.21^] 
the best Hopped Drink and if your 
Wormwood is well preserved, it will 
keep three, four or five Years good, 
and the second and third Year, it is 
better than the first. The very same 
Method is to be observed in useing all 
other Herbs. 
 
But if the forementioned way should 
make the Grains so bitter, that Cattel 
will not eat them. Then observe the 
following Method, viz. Make of fine 
thin Canvas Baggs, both for your strong 
Beer, Ale and small Beer, and put such 
a quantity of your Wormwood as you 
think fit into them, aud when your several 
sorts of Drink is Working in the 
Tun, then hang these Baggs in your 
Working Drink for three Hours, and 
then take them out; this being an approved 
way, which do impregnate or 
imbibe the fine airy Spirituous Vertues 
of the Wormwood into the Drink. The 
natural and common vertues of this 
Drink is, it warms and strengthens the 
Stomack, fines the Blood, purgeth by 
Urine, Generates like pure Spirits, and 
Drink thus made, if not too strong nor 
too great a quantity Drank, then it will 
prove a Friend both to the Eyes & Head. 
- as well as to the Stomach.
