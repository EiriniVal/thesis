[}The fyrst chapitre 
treateth vniuersally of Anatomie, 
whych is ryght necessarie 
for chirurgiens, in the whych Anatomie 
the vtilities and profectes of 
the same are declared, and wherof Anatomie 
is called, what a Synnowe, 
a Uayne, an Arterie, a Chorde, a bone 
a Cartilage or Gristel, is, and wherof 
they come. After this the nombre 
of Bones, Muscles, and Synnowes 
of the hole bodye, 
of man bene declared.}] 
 
AS Galene the 
prince of Phisitions 
wytnesseth 
in the .ix. 
boke of the vtilitie 
of partes, 
and in the laste 
chapitre, there 
ben foure vtilities 
in Anatomie. The first is to declare 
the mighty power of god, in y=t=, that 
he hath created mans body so parfyte 
in hys qualities. The seconde is to 
knowe the partes of mans bodye, to 
the entent that we maye worke duely 
in euery parte therof. The thyrde, to 
shewe aforehande the effecte of euerye 
disposition of the same. The fourth 
and last vtilitie is, to heale the sondrye 
dyseases, whych dayly chaunce. Wherfore 
it is not onely requisite that chirurgiens 
knowe Anatomie, but also 
phisitio~s. For it is very harde for him, 
y=t= is ignoraunt in Anatomie to worke 
co~mely and decently, in mans bodye, 
as in cuttynge, sewynge, burnynge, or 
applyeng cauteries actuall or potentiall 
and semblable thynges. By occasion 
whereof daunger of homicide or 
manslaughter may ensue for an ignoraunt 
chirurgien ofte~ tymes toucheth 
a synnowe in stede of a veyne. And he 
is as a coke that knoweth not how to 
choppe hys meate accordyngly, and so 
wynneth shame and reproche before 
hys mayster. Therfore it is necessarie 
that phisitions, and chirurgie~s knowe 
Anatomie & it is great shame to them 
whych ben ignoraunt in the sayd Anatomie. 
For euerye man is bounde to 
knowe the subiecte or mater, whervppon 
he worketh, otherwyse he shall 
erre in hys workemanshyppe. Seyng 
then that a chirurgie~ worketh in ma~s 
body he is bou~de to knowe, the partes 
therof. As Henricus of Ermu~dauilla 
sayeth in his chirurgerie, that a chirurgien, 
whyche knoweth not Anatomie 
is to be compared to a blynde ma~, that 
worketh in a peece of woode. For the 
blynde man fayleth oft, and cutteth to 
muche or to lytle, and euen so dothe a 
chirurgien ignoraunt in Anatomie. 
 
Anatomie is a ryghte science, by 
[/1./] 
whych the membres of ma~s body are 
knowen, through diuision of the same 
And it is to be noted that Anatomie 
is knowen two maner of wayes, as 
mayster Guydo declareth a ma~ singulerly 
lerned in the arte of chirurgerie. 
The fyrst is by bokes, whych is ryght 
profytable. The seconde is more euident, 
namely by deed bodyes, in which 
true exeperience consysteth. And here 
in the chirurgiens haue a laudable custome 
to require the bodyes of men co~demned 
to death. They take the deade 
bodye, and laye hym vpon a table, as 
maister Mondine a man wel experte 
in chirurgerie, was wonte to do. 
 
And when the bodye is layed vpon 
the table, they make foure elections or 
[/2./] 
chosynges therof. The fyrst is of me~bres 
nutritiue, for they ben more apte 
to receyue putrefactions or rottynges 
then other. The seconde election is of 
membres spirituall, as of the hart, of 
[^f.1v^] 
of the pannicles or thynne skynnes, of 
the longes. The thyrde election is, 
of the membres animale, that is to say 
of the heade, and hys partes. The 
fourth of the extremities of the bodye, 
as of the armes, the legges, and theyr 
partes. 
 
[/3./] 
And in euery membre of mans bodye, 
after the opinion of Auerroys, 
and Alexandrinus, and other Anatomistes, 
nyne thynges are to be consydered, 
that is to wete, the composition, 
the substaunce, the complexion, the 
quantite, the nombre, the fygure, the 
combination or knyttynge together, 
theyr naturall effectes and vtilities, 
and what dyseases may happen to the 
sayd membres. Whych dyseases the 
chirurgien maye ease in knowynge, in 
curynge, and pronosticating. And therfore 
the good auctour Galene came to 
the knowlege of Anatomie, by beholdynge 
of the bodyes of pygges, apes, 
and other beestes, nether dydde he as 
some which paynte Anatomies, wherin 
we ought not to reste. 
 
[/4./] 
What is then mans body? it is the 
subiecte or mater wherof mencion is 
made in all Phisyke, and chirurgerie. 
Mans bodye is a thinge composed, or 
set together accordynge to reason, and 
garnyshed wyth sondrye partes, wherof 
we wyl make me~tion in thys boke. 
 
[/5./] 
A membre (as Galene sayeth in the 
boke of the vtilities of partes of ma~s 
bodye,) is a bodye whych is not seperated 
from hys hole, and is not ioyned 
to another thynge. After Auicenne 
a membre is a bodye engendred of the 
fyrst co~mixtion of humours. 
 
[/6./] 
Of whych membres, some ben symple, 
and some ben compou~de. The simple 
ben tenne in nombre, that is to say 
the synnowes, the Cartilages or gristelles, 
the bones, veynes, arteries, pa~nicles, 
ligamentes, chordes or tendones, 
the outward skynne, y=e= fleshe that 
is in the gummes, and in the heade of 
a mans yarde. Also heere, the nayles, & 
fatte may be nu~bred amonge the same, 
though they be not properly membres 
but superfluities, whych nature hathe 
brought forth to garnyshe, & adourne 
mans bodye, as other membres also, 
after y=e= declaratio~ of Galene is secu~do 
techne. And seynge y=t= we haue made 
[/7./] 
mention of heeres, we wyll begyn to 
speake of them. Rasis sayeth that nature 
hathe set heeres, on the heade to 
purge superfluous vapours or fumes 
whych ascende into the brayne, by the 
pores or lytle passages of the bones of 
the heade. Another reason is, to decke 
the bodye of man or woman. And they 
ben more colde, and drye then any other 
membres of mans bodye. 
 
A synnowe is a symple or syngle 
[/8./] 
membre (as Auicenna sayeth) and 
gyueth felynge, and mouyng to al the 
membres of mans body. And they procede 
all, from the brayne, and ben of a 
colde and drye qualitie. 
 
A muscle is a membre compou~de of 
[/9./] 
synnowes, ligame~tes, and fleshie fyllettes 
or as it were thredes, fylled w=t= 
fleshe, and couered wyth a pannicle. 
And it is called muscle for y=e= sembla~ce 
and lykenes of a lytle mouse. And Auicenna 
sayeth that a muscle, and a lacert 
dyfferre not, but in thys poynte that a 
muscle hath the semblaunce of a lytle 
mouse: And a lacerte hath the semblaunce 
of a lytle worme called a Li3arde, 
whyche bene two beestes, that 
are somewhat grosse in the bodye, and 
small in the tayles. And as touchynge 
the greate partes, they maye be nombred 
amonge the membres compou~de 
But as concernynge the smale partes, 
they maye be called symple membres 
bycause of the synnowes, wherof 
they take parte. 
 
The opinion of Galene concercernyng 
muscles is true, which sayeth 
[^f.2r^] 
that after the muscles bene accomplyshed 
of synnowes, lygamentes, fleshe 
and Skynne, of the sayde Muscles 
there growe chordes, and ligamentes 
whyche ben rounde. And when they 
come aboute y=e= ioyntes, they compasse 
the ioyntes aboute in maner of pellicles 
or thynne skynnes, and gyue them 
mouynge. And when the nexte ioynture 
is well knytte together, they goo 
from that and come to compasse about 
semblably another ioynture, and they 
cease not to bynde together, vntyll 
they come to the extreme partes of 
the bodye. The sayde muscles bene in 
nombre fyue hundred thyrty and one, 
after Auicenne. 
 
Bones bene symple membres, harder 
[/10./] 
then other, excepte the teethe as 
Auicenna sayeth, and therfore they 
sustayne the other partes, and are of 
a colde and drye complexion. And nature 
hath brought forth some of them 
for the defence of the noble membres 
as the sculle whyche defendeth the 
brayne, and the bones of the breste 
and of the backe, whyche ben for the 
preseruacion of the herte and of the 
[/11./] 
Nuke, whyche is the mary in the 
backe bone. And the bones of mans 
bodye bene greater in the endes, then 
in other partes, wyth an apparaunt 
roundnes, and some wyth hollownes 
And the bones whyche bene ioyned to 
the ioyntures wyth conuenient hollownes, 
are not lyghtelye put out of 
ioynte, for the hollownes of the ioyntures 
bene fylled wyth the roundnes 
of the other bones. And, as Auicenna 
sayeth, there ben some naturallye enclyned 
to haue theyr membres soone 
put oute of ioynte, bycause the hollownes 
of theyr bones is not depe 
ynoughe. The bones of mannes bodye 
after Auicenne bene in nombre 
two hundred fortye and eyghte, besyde 
the bones called Sisamina, and 
Os Laude, whyche is the fundation 
[/12./] 
of the tonge. 
 
A chorde groweth oute of a muscle, 
[/13./] 
and is compounded of synnowie 
matter, and of pellicles, pannicles or 
thynne skynnes. And the accidentes 
of chordes, and of synnowes ben lyke. 
And as Galene sayeth vpon the Aphorismes 
of Hypocrates, a Spasme or 
the cra~pe foloweth y=e= pryckyng of synnowes 
and chordes or tendons. And 
euen as a chorde is meane betwene 
a synnowe, and a ligamente, so a ligamente 
is meane betwene a synnowe, 
and a bone. Here foloweth of ligamentes. 
 
There bene two maner of ligamentes, 
[/14./] 
some growe or descende oute 
of chordes, as we haue declared afore 
of muscles, as Galene recyteth. Howe 
be it, Guido is not of that opinion, 
whych semeth to vary from the truth, 
sayenge that all the ligame~tes growe 
out of the bones. I haue founde no 
doctour of that opinion. There is a 
nother maner of ligamentes, whych 
growe out of the bones, as Auicenna 
sayeth in the chapitre De resolutione 
continuitatis neruorum. And moreouer 
Auicenne sayeth that ligamentes 
whyche growe out of the bones bene 
insensyble membres, and that a man 
maye laye to them, stronge medicines. 
And this is the cause why Guido said 
that all the ligamentes growe out of 
the bones. And Auicenna sayeth in the 
same chapitre y=t= the synnowes whych 
ben ioyned with the muscles take part 
of them, and Haliabbas is of the same 
opinion in the seco~de boke of the assignation 
of the ligame~tes, and chordes. 
 
[/15./] 
Pannicles bene of a synnowie mater, 
thoughe the hurte of them be not 
so dangerous as of a synnowe, neuertheles 
by reason of the greate sensibilite 
or felynge of the same there is 
much danger there in, for sometymes 
[^f.2v^] 
they induce a spasme, that is a co~traction 
of synnowes. 
 
[/16./] 
A gristell is, of the nature of bones, 
but it is softer. And gristelles were 
made for supplementes or fyllinges of 
bones, and for the garnyshynge of the 
partes of mans bodye, as ye maye se 
euidently in the nose, and in the eares. 
And therfore the solution of the continuite 
of the same (as Hypocrates sayeth) 
receaueth not restauration, after 
the fyrste intencion of restorynge and 
consoundynge of membres. And Hypocrates 
sayeth that when the bones 
or the grystelles, or the lyppes, or the 
heade of the yeard ben wounded, they 
growe no more, neyther canne be consounded 
after the waye of the fyrst intention. 
 
[/17./] 
Of veynes. A veyne is a membre 
whyche conteyneth bloode, hauynge 
hys begynnynge at the lyuer. 
 
[/18./] 
Arterie is a vessell conteynynge 
spirituall bloode, and spirites hauyng 
theyr begynnynge at the herte. Galene 
sayeth in the .xvi. boke de vtilitate particularum, 
that Arteries dyfferre not 
from veynes, but in the place of theyr 
begynnynge, and that these two bene 
ioyned together throughe all the body 
sauynge that the Arterie is sondred in 
some partes, as in the plyghte of the 
arme, and in rheti mirabili. 
 
[/19./] 
The skynne is the fyrst thinge, that 
appeareth in the outwarde partes. 
And therfore we wyll begynne oure 
Anatomie at the same. Skynne is the 
couerture of mans bodye co~pounde of 
fyllettes or fylmes, or as it were lytle 
thredes procedynge from the veynes, 
synnowes, and smale arteries, ordeyned 
to retayne the spirites and felynge 
of the bodye. And there ben two maner 
of skynnes, the one couereth the 
outwarde membres, and the other is 
a pannicle couerynge the membres 
wythin the bodye, as the couerture of 
the bones called almokatim, the pannicle 
of the braine, the couerture of the 
rybbes and other semblable. 
 
Fleshe is diuided into thre kyndes 
[/20./] 
that is to wete, fleshe Glandulous or 
Kernellie, fleshe full of muscles, and 
symple fleshe. Fleshe symple is onelye 
founde in the gommes, and in y=e= heade 
of the yarde. Fleshe Glandulous is 
founde in the brestes of women and in 
the Emunctories, or clensyng places, 
& of thys kynde is the fleshe of the stones. 
The thyrd kynde is fleshe musculous 
whyche is founde throughe out 
all the bodye, in the partes, where voluntaire 
mouyng is, neuertheles fat, 
the nayles, the heeres are nombred co~munely 
amonge the symple membres 
whyche thynges are superfluities produced 
for the profyte of the bodye as 
we haue sayd before. 
 
Of symple membres some haue 
[/21./] 
theyr generation of Sperma or sede, 
therfore when solution of continuite 
is caused in them, that is when they 
ben wounded, they can not be trulye 
restored, as they were before, but they 
bene repared by some meane, as by a 
pore called Sarcoides, or by harde 
fleshe, as for an exemple: the bones of 
the heade, the gristels of the nostrelles 
Some of the symple membres haue 
theyr generation of bloode, as fleshe, 
fatte: the solution of the continuite 
where of, maye be trulye consounded, 
and restored. And of these membres 
some ben colde and drye, as gristelles, 
bones, heeres, ligamentes, chordes, 
veynes, and pannicles. 
 
The skynne is of an hote and drye 
[/22./] 
nature contrarie to the nature of al other 
membres simple. For the skynne 
is not onely the meane of the partes 
of the bodye, but also it is a meane 
of all the substaunce generatiue and 
corruptiue. The membres simple 
hote and moyst ben spirites, & fleshe, 
[^f.3r^] 
as Auerroys sayeth. The mary, flegme 
and fatte are colde and moyste. 
 
[}The seconde Chaptre.}] 
 
[/23./] 
NOwe that we haue spoken 
of symple membres it is co~uenient 
that we traicte of 
membres compounde The 
membres compounde ben those which 
ben co~posed or set together of the foresayd 
symple membres. And they bene 
called properly Membra heterogenia 
that is membres made of other & that 
may be diuided into another kynde, or 
membres instrumentall, because they 
ben the instrumentes of the soule, as 
the face, the handes, the fete, the herte, 
the lyuer. And of these membres compounde 
some ben called membres principall, 
some not principall. 
 
[/24./] 
The principal membres ben foure, 
the herte, the brayne, the lyuer and the 
stones. The membres compounde not 
principall ben all the other excepte the 
[/25./] 
symple, as the eyes, the nose, the eares 
the head, the face, the necke, the armes 
the legges, and semblable, whose complection 
shalbe declared in the chaptre 
folowynge. 
 
[}The thyrde chaptre of the Anatomie 
of the heade, and of the membres 
conteyned in the same.}] 
 
WE haue traicted sufficientlye 
of the Anatomie 
of membres compou~de, 
and that it behoueth to 
consyder nyne thynges 
touchynge euery membre of mans bodye, 
but Auicenna sayeth y=t= in the Anatomie 
[/26./] 
of the heade, we muste co~sydre 
aleuen thinges, and fyrst the situation 
of the same. The heade was not set in 
the hyghest parte of the bodye for the 
nastrelles, nor for the brayne nor for 
any other sens, but cheifly for the eyes 
as Auicenna sayth, and for the vertue 
of seynge. And the reason is thys, bycause 
the eyes haue y=e= garde & kepynge 
of the body, so that men maye se theyr 
enemyes afarre of, & auoyde that, that 
is noysome to the bodye. They were 
ordeyned of nature in the former part, 
that they might receaue the visible spirite 
by the synnowe called Optique, 
and that they might carye visible thinges 
to y=e= co~mune sens, for the synnowe 
Optique beyng diuided into two brau~ches 
entreth into y=e= composition of the 
eye, as we shall declare here after. An 
other reason is thys, bycause the eyes 
receaue mouynge of the seconde payre 
of synnowes, whych procede from the 
brayne. And for these causes nature 
hath set the heade in the hyghest parte 
of the bodye. 
 
The parte couered wyth heere, 
[/27./] 
and conteynynge the brayne, and the 
interiour partes of the same, and the 
Animal spirites, is called after the philosophers 
the vessell or panne. It foloweth 
consequently that we consyder 
the ioynynges of the partes of y=e= same 
For fro~ the heade the muscles procede 
and Lacertes whyche go to the necke, 
and to the face, & ben moued throughe 
all the partes of the heed. The brayne 
panne of a man is greater then of any 
other lyuyng thynge, bycause y=e= braine 
is of greater quantite in man, then in 
other beestes. The fourme of the heed 
is rounde as a boole, and as Galene 
sayeth, a rounde fygure amonge all other 
is moost noble, and in lest dau~ger 
of noysome thynges. It is also bossie, 
and bouncheth out in the fore and in 
the hynder partes. The composition 
of the same is partly bonye, partly ful 
of mary, and is of a colde complexion, 
& also the partes therof, and the dyseases 
whyche chaunce in it, as the tothache, 
dysease of the eyes, Catarrhes, & 
[^f.3v^] 
lyke thynges, as it shalbe declared in a 
chapter for the same purpose. The no~bre 
of the partes is knowe~ by the partes 
conteynynge and co~teyned, and by 
[/28./] 
the bone called Basilare, vpon whych 
all the bones of the heade haue theyr 
seate and fou~dation. The partes conteynynge 
ben fyue, the heere, the skyn, 
the musculous fleshe, the pannicle, 
whyche is called pericranium, or gingiua 
mater, bycause it procedeth from 
dura mater by the commissures of the 
bones of the heade, after thys is the 
bone named Cranium, or the fyrst table 
of the bones of the heade. The partes 
conteyned ben fyue. The fyrst is 
the bone called the seconde table. The 
seconde is, a grosse pannicle called Dura 
mater. The thyrde couereth the substau~ce 
of the brayne, and is called Pia 
mater, or y=e= Teye. The fourth is Rhete 
mirabile. The fyfth is the substau~ce of 
the brayne. Under thies is y=e= bone called 
Basilare, whych susteyneth y=e= head 
And it is called Basilare of Basis, 
whych sygnifyeth a fou~dation. There 
ben in the composition of the heade seuen 
principall bones of whych y=e= fyrst 
[/29./] 
is called Coronale, and begynneth after 
the opinion of Haliabas in the fore 
parte aboute the eye browes, & endeth 
at the Coronale co~missure. And in that 
bone there is some tymes a strayte co~missure 
or seame goynge dyrectly to y=e= 
myddest of the heade, chiefly of wome~ 
And it is called the bone coronale, bycause 
kynges beare theyr crownes vppo~n 
that bone. In the nether partes of 
thys bone ben two holes, whyche are 
called Colatories or strayners of the 
nastrelles, and betwene the concauite 
or hollownes of the two eyes there is 
a lytle bonye addition in the facyon of 
a cokescombe, vpon the whyche nature 
hathe planted the grystelles of 
the nastrelles, to diuide the nastrelles. 
 
After this ben the two Laterall or 
[/30./] 
syde bones ioyned to the bone coronal 
on both sydes, and in the hynder parte 
they ben ioyned to y=e= bone called Laude, 
or occipitall in the hynder parte. 
[/31./] 
And in the toppe of the heade, they ben 
closed together lyke a sawe. And they 
make the commissure called sagittalis 
For they come dyrectly from the coronall 
bone to the co~missure called Lauda, 
and thys is the commyssure called 
Transuersalis, in thys fygure of ciffre 
[/32./] 
7. And y=e= bone called Lauda is of harder 
substaunce the~ the other, in whych 
there is an hole, and through that hole 
the marye called Nuka descendethe 
from the brayne to the ende of y=e= backe 
by Spondiles. 
 
After this ben the bones called Petrosa 
[/33./] 
or stonye, whych are false co~missures 
or seames touchyng the two Laterall 
or syde bones in the ryghte and 
the left syde. And they ben called false 
co~missures, bycause they ben skalie, & 
stonye, and harder the~ other. And they 
are bored through for the necessitie of 
hearynge. And these bones begynne 
at the commissure called Lauda, and 
ende in the myddest of the temples. 
The last bone is called Basilare whyche 
susteyneth the heade as it is aforesayde. 
And thys bone hathe manye 
holes, and spongiositees, whych serue 
to purge the superfluities of the 
brayne, of these seuen bones procede 
fyue commyssures, where of thre ben 
trewe, and the other false, as we haue 
sayde. 
 
The fyrste of the thre commyssures, 
is called the commyssure Coronall. 
The seconde Sagittall. The thyrde 
Laudale. Nature hath produced 
the bones of the heede spongious, 
and full of pores or priuye holes, in 
the myddes of two tables, that thoroughe 
theyr spongiosite they myghte 
drawe theyr nouryshment. And they 
[^f.4r^] 
ben full of pores, that y=e= moyst fumes 
ascendynge from the brayne maye vapoure 
out, wythout the hurte of the 
brayne. 
 
The hed was made of sondrie bones 
to the entente that yf one parte were 
hurte, it shulde not be commucated to 
the other. And that the Anatomie of 
membres co~tained in the head might 
be more euidently declared, it is profitable 
after that ye haue taken awaye 
y=e= flesche of the sculle, & of the eyebrowes 
to diuide the brayne panne with 
a sawe circularely. For incontinently, 
assone as it is opened, ye maye see the 
inner table full of pores and glassie, 
as the outwarde, and ye may see also, 
the saide true commissures, to whiche 
the pannicle called dura mater is knyt 
and ioyned. 
 
Nature hathe produced thies commissures, 
for foure causes. The first is 
that the veynes maye entre by them 
whiche brynge nourishement to the 
brayne. The seconde, that the fillettes 
or thredes of the sinowes procedynge 
from the braine maye comme out, and 
gyue felyng to y=e= partes lying aboute. 
The thyrde, that the vapoures ascendyng 
to the braine may haue passage. 
The last that the pannicle dura mater 
maye be holden vp, that it greue 
not the braine. By the middele or 
sagyttalle commyssure there passe 
two veynes, procedynge frome the 
liuer, and entre in vndre y=e= sculle, lyke 
wyse by the hole of the bone called 
basilare theyr commethe an Arterie 
procedynge frome the harte, and ascendeth 
in to the heade vntill he ioyne 
hymselfe to the sinowes, and veynes 
afore sayde. Of whiche the harde pannicle 
called dura mater is co~pouned, 
and is ioyned to the commissures procedynge 
wythout them, by certaine 
lytle synnowes, and as it were heres 
so that those synnowes and heeres or 
thynne thredes commynge out of the 
commissures make a pannicle, whiche 
couereth all the sculle, and is called 
Gingiua mater or Pericraniu~. Therfore 
[/34./] 
it was conuenient that an Arterie 
shulde ascende vpwarde fro~ the hart, 
for if hys pulsatiue mouynge, and subtile 
bloode shulde haue gone downewarde, 
it wolde haue descended to hastely. 
Therefore it is moderated by 
mountynge or goynge vpwarde. Neuertheles 
it was mete that the veyne 
shulde goe downewarde frome the ouer 
parte to the nether, that the grosse 
bloode myght easely descende. 
 
Also the sayde veynes, synnowes, 
[/35./] 
and arteries ioyne them selues together 
agayne, as it is sayde, and make a 
pannicle verye thynne and subtile called 
pia mater, whiche couerethe al the 
braine. And than the sayd veynes, and 
arteries goe downe to the braine, and 
gyue it lyfe, nourischement, and vitall 
spirite procedyng from the harte. And 
asmuche more as the braine receaueth 
of that vitall spirite, so muche more 
perfecte ben the animall spirites. 
 
[/36./] 
The brayne is a substaunce full of 
marye diuided in to three ve~tricles of 
whyche there is one in the fore parte 
which is greater than the other three. 
The seconde is in the myddest. The 
thyrde hath hys resydence in the hyndre 
parte. And therfore after Galenes 
iudgeme~t, it is the foundation of imagination, 
and of deuysynge, and of remembraunce. 
Rasis also affyrmethe 
that the thyrde ventricle is the fountayne 
of y=e= senses, and voluntarie mouynge. 
 
The Nuke is as it were a streame 
[/37./] 
descendynge from the sayd partie, and 
the synnowes that comme frome the 
same are, as it were lytle ryuers commynge 
out of a greate streame. And 
moreouer the sayd Rasis sayeth, that 
whan the heade sprynge that is the 
[^f.4v^] 
brayne is endammaged, al the ryuers 
namely synnowes descendynge frome 
the same be also endammaged, by the 
reason of participation. But yf anye 
harme chaunce to the ryuers, the fou~tayne 
is not alwaye hurted, but the 
places wherunto the synnowes are 
directed. The substaunce of the braine 
is whyte, and full of marye, and 
softe, and of a colde, and moyste qualyte. 
In whyche qualytee it differreth 
frome the maryes of other bones. 
 
For it was not ordayned to nourishe 
the sculle, but to conteyne the brayne, 
& to preserue the same. And the pryncypall 
vtilyte of it is, to tempre the 
heate of the vitall spirites procedynge 
frome the harte that the animall spyrites 
myght be made. 
 
We sayed before that the brayne 
[/38./] 
hathe three ventricles, and the former 
and the hynder after the opinyon of 
Anatomistes ben diuided in the myddell, 
that is to saye in the ryght syde, 
and in the lyfte, and the sydes of them 
ben wrapped aboute wyth the sayde 
pannicles, goynge here and there vnto 
the fundation by whiche the ryght 
parte is diuyded frome the lyfte. In 
the fore parte, that is in the fyrste ventricle 
[/39./] 
consysteth fantasie, whyche retaynethe 
the semblaunces of thynges 
receaued by syght, and hearynge. In 
the hyndre parte consisteth the vertue 
[/40./] 
imaginatiue, whyche apprehendethe 
thynges receaued & reteyned by fantasie. 
In the middel ventricule resteth 
[/41./] 
the commune sense, whych apprehendeth 
the semblau~ces of thinges brou3t 
vnto hym by particulare senses, and 
therefore it is directed to that place, 
and there is ended. And hereby appeareth 
y=e= profite of this ventricle, which 
serueth to imagination or fantasie, & 
to the co~mune sense, and was produced, 
that it shulde gyue sense, & animal 
spirite to al the instrume~tes of felyng. 
 
Also the accide~tes which may chau~ce 
to this ventricle, ben apparant as solution 
of continuite, euyll complectio~, 
the payne of migraime, whan there is 
anye hurte in the ventricle, and some 
tymes it sufferethe Apostemes hote & 
colde. Yf the Aposteme be hote, and co~siste 
in y=e= pa~nicles it is called Sirsen. 
[/42./] 
Yf the Aposteme be colde it is called 
[/43./] 
Lethargus, and inducethe forgetfulnes. 
And yf by chaunce there be an Aposteme 
in the substau~ce of the braine 
it is called a mortal Aposteme. There 
maye also chaunce to them a disease 
by reason of the euyll composition, w=t= 
yf it bee vtterly stoppynge, ether it is 
by vapoures, and than causeth Uertigo 
[/44./] 
or scotome, which is a darckeni~g 
of the syght, and a swymmyng in the 
head as though all thynges turned aboute. 
Or yf it be of an euyll humour 
than it causeth astonishement, and the 
Palsie. And yf al the ventricles of the 
[/45./] 
braine be stopped with the substaunce 
of the braine, they cause a co~tinuall apoplexie. 
[/46./] 
 
Also the braine is diuided in to foure 
partes, the former, the hynder, y=e= right 
& the lyfte: in the former parte bloode 
raigneth, in the hyndre parte flegme, 
in the right cholere, in the lifte, melancholie. 
And therefore the former parte 
is hotest. [}The seconde ventricle.}] 
 
AFter that we haue spoken of 
the fyrst ventricle, and of the 
seate and complection of it, 
and of the vtilities, and diseases that 
maye chaunce to the same, it is conuenient 
that we speake of the seconde ve~tricle. 
In the ende of the first ventricle 
there ben two smal partes or substau~ces 
after the maner of the nastrelles 
of a man, whyche ben to the ventricle, 
as it were a bedde, where vpon it 
stretcheth it selfe in length whan it receaueth 
Imagined thynges. And afterwarde 
it is drawen together lyke 
[^f.5r^] 
an erthe worme which thing it doeth, 
wha~ y=e= vertu extractiue thynketh vpo~ 
apprehended, and determined thynges, 
vntil the sentence be pronounced. 
And it prolongethe it selfe lykewyse, 
wha~ remembraunce of thynges declared 
is apprehended by the thyrde ventricle. 
Of thes two substaunces, one 
is as a redde worme, as it is afore declared, 
and it may stretche forthe, and 
drawe backe. The other is as it were 
a knockle whiche closethe it selfe, and 
openethe. And this was ordayned of 
nature, that the apprehended semblaunces 
shuld not passe from one ve~tricle 
to another, wha~ a man wil cease 
from exterior operatio~s of the senses, 
or thynkyng and deuysyng. The saide 
seconde ventricle is smal and thynne, 
and it passethe frome the fyrste, to the 
last, and toucheth bothe. And therfore 
it is an instrument of two vertues namely 
of thynkyng and diuidyng, and 
of inferrynge one thynge of another. 
And the seconde vertue is to iudge & 
to discerne true thynges from false. 
 
[}Of the thyrde ventricle.}] 
 
The thyrde ventricle hathe hys 
seate in the hyndre parte of the heade. 
And in substau~ce it is harder than the 
other, wherfore the synnowes, which 
growe out of it, or out of the Nuke, 
which is the vicarie of the sayd ve~tricle 
ben of harde nature. And the ryme 
called pia mater is not ioyned w=t= thys 
ventricle as w=t= the other, bycause it is 
harde ynough of hisown nature. The 
substau~ce of the other is softer than of 
this, & therfore nature wolde that pia 
mater shulde ayde the other to co~teyne 
the brayne. It is made after the figure 
of a steple that islarge beneth, & sharp 
aboue, that it mi3t retayn in his large 
parte pronou~ced sentences, & kepe the~ 
secretly, as a chest whyche couereth a 
[/47./] 
treasure & his co~plection is colde and 
drie, & the co~plection of the seconde ve~tricle 
is hote & moyst. The Nuke wrapped 
in two pannicles procedyng from 
the braine hath his begynnyng of this 
laste ventricle & goethe downe by the 
hole of the bone called Basilare, & passethe 
by the middest of the spondeles, 
vntill he touche the ende of the backe 
bone. The said Nuke is like mary, & of 
semblable substaunce as the braine is 
and hath the same accidentes that the 
braine hathe. 
 
It is necessarie to knowe that seue~ 
payre of synnowes haue theyr generation 
immediatly of the brayne after y=e= 
length therof, and thirtie payre which 
passe thorough the middle of the nuke 
and one, which hath not a felowe. Further 
more in the extremite of the fyrst 
& seconde ve~tricle in desce~dyng. There 
[/48./] 
is a hole called Lacuna, y=t= is a syncke, 
in the middest wherof there is a lytle 
hole which co~meth to the rouffe of the 
mouth, by which superfluites be~ purged, 
& it procedeth directly frome the 
seconde ventricle, and passeth by the 
bone called Basilare, lykewyse the 
pa~nicle named Dura mater is bored 
thorough in the fore parte vndre the 
bone of the foreheade, that by it the superfluites 
of the ventricles might be 
purged by the conduyctes of the nose. 
 
And another reason there was, that 
by the conduycte of the nose the vertue 
of smellynge myght be made perfaicte. 
And rounde aboute the sayd co~duycte 
ben certayne rounde pieces of 
flesche standynge out, whyche after 
Mondine ben produced to sustayne y=e= 
veynes, and the Arteries, whyche 
mounte vp frome rhete mirabile, to 
the sayde ventricles, and therefore 
there ben glandules or kernelles hard 
by the Rhete mirabile. The sayde 
[/49./] 
Rhete mirabile is lyke a nette, and is 
therefore called Rhete, for this pannicle 
is compounded onlye wyth Arteries, 
as Guido hathe declared saying, 
[^f.5v^] 
that in certayne places an Arterie is 
diuided fro~ a veyne, as in the middle 
of the arme and in Rheti mirabili. 
 
[}The. iiij. Chap. of the Anatomie of 
the necke and of the throte.}] 
 
WE haue declared 
in y=e= former chapiter 
the Anatomie 
of the heade 
It is nowe requisite 
that we 
speke of the face, 
of the necke, of 
the eyes, of the throte & theyr partes. 
And fyrst we must knowe that there 
ben in the throte two conduyctes. Of 
whiche by one the meate and drincke 
passe, descendyng in to the stomake, & 
[/50./] 
is called Meri or Oisophagus, in Englishe 
the Gulle, beynge co~pouned of 
two thynne skynnes, and of synnowie 
small thredes or fylmes. Of whyche 
skynnes of Tunicles the one is verie 
synnowie in the parte touchynge the 
palate or rouffe of the mouthe. The other 
is fleschie & full of muscles whyche 
in the outwarde parte is ioyned 
to the pannicle of the stomake. 
 
The other conduycte called Trachea 
[/51./] 
Arteria or the wesaunde is that, 
by whiche the wynde or Ayre is conueyed 
to the longes. The fyrste conduycte 
called Meri is situated vpon 
fyue spondiles of the necke behynde, 
and goth downewarde, tyll he be ioyned 
to y=e= middriffe, whiche is a skynne 
compassynge the longes. And after y=e= 
opynion of Rasis, of that conduycte 
[/52./] 
Meri the stomake procedethe. The 
throte is the begynnynge of the sayde 
conduyctes in whyche there is an 
emptie place, where the two Amigdales 
[/53./] 
ben, that is to saye two pieces 
of flesche after the facion of two Almondes, 
one in the right syde and the 
other in the lyfte. And thes Amigdales 
ben fleschie & synnowie, that they 
may be the stronger, for they gyue entraunce 
to mete and dryncke that they 
maye easely passe in to the conduycte 
called Meri or the Gulle, and they 
helpe the ayre to go in to the weasau~d 
by the Epiglotte. 
 
The Epiglotte is a certayne eminence, 
[/54./] 
whych appeareth in the throte 
in the toppe of the wesaunde produced 
of nature for thys purpose that in 
eatynge, and drynckynge, nothynge 
entre in, but the ayre. And whan anye 
thynge goethe in, it makethe a manne 
to coughe tyll it be out agayn. And the 
vtilite of thys partycle is thys, that 
by the meane thereof, the bodye drawethe 
and retayneth ayre accordynge 
as it is necessarye, and it helpethe also 
to fourme and fascion voyces. In the 
fore parte (as we haue sayde) is the 
Trachea Arteria or wesaunde compouned 
of gristellye rynges, ioyned 
one to another, hauynge an inwarde 
pannicle whyche tyeth the sayde rynges 
one to another, whyche ben verye 
rough in the inwarde parte, and 
are ioyned to the throte gulle, beynge 
a lytle seperated the one frome the other 
The throte gulle is made lyke 
a cane compouned of veynes Arteries, 
and synnowes procedynge of 
the syxe payre of synnowes, whyche 
co~me from the fore parte of the braine. 
And on the ryght, and the lyfte syde 
there ben certayn instrume~tal veynes 
called Guidegi vpon the which great 
[/55./] 
Arteries are situated. And therefore 
the cuttynge and pryckynge of them 
is dangerous by reason of the nyghnes, 
and affinitie, that they haue w~ 
the lyuer and the harte. For often 
tymes a man dyethe by suffocation or 
chokynge whan the veynes of the 
[^f.6r^] 
poulse ben prycked. Semblably the 
[/56./] 
Uuula was produced cheifly to forme 
the voyce, in retaynynge the ayer accordynge 
to the wyll of man. And also 
to purge the superfluites ot y=e= brayne, 
and it hangethe iustly betwene the 
two Amigdales or almandes as it 
were a grayne of a Pyne apple, and 
it is of a spongious, and rare substaunce. 
 
[}The. v. Chap. of the Iawes 
and the Teethe.}] 
 
AFter the opinion of Anatomistes 
the teth be~ 
xxxij. in nombre. Of 
[/57./] 
whych some ben Incisorij 
that is cuttynge, 
and they serue to cut y=e= 
[/58./] 
meate. The other ben called Canini 
sharpe as the teethe of a Dogge, and 
they are co~munly called the eye teeth, 
for theyr rootes goe welnygh to the 
eyes. There ben some which be called 
[/59./] 
Molares bicause they grynde y=e= mete 
as a mille corne, and they begynne the 
fyrste digestion. 
 
There ben. xvj. in the ouer iawe, & 
they ben compouned of. xiiij. bones, 
whose compositio~ is vnknowen. And 
that iawe is couered wyth a pannicle 
procedynge out of the fore part of the 
foreheade, whyche pannicle is called 
Pericranium. Consequentelye the 
sayde iawe takethe parte of the synnowes 
of the thyrde payre, procedynge 
frome the brayne, and of the 
seco~de parte of the Nuke. The skynne 
of the face commethe of the Pericranium 
and takethe parte of the thyrde 
payre, and parte of the fourthe, and 
fyfte payre of synnowes procedynge 
frome the brayne wyth certayne 
veynes, and Arteries, and stretcheth 
it selfe ouer all the face and therefore 
the sayde synnowes cause the felyng, 
and mouyng of all the face. It is conuenyent 
to knowe that all the teethe 
ben knytte wythe lygamentes, and 
pannicles procedynge out of the foresayde 
pannicle. The nether iawe 
is compouned of two bones, and aboute 
the chynne it is ioyned together 
lyke a sawe, and is knytte to the 
other. And we wyll make a chapitre 
of them, and of theyr dislocation, or 
displacynge. 
 
[}The. vi. Chap. of the tonge and 
of the eares.}] 
 
THe tonge is a me~bre 
[/60./] 
ryght necessarye 
whyche nature 
hath produced 
in the mouth, 
and it is spongious, 
and fleschie, 
compouned of sinnowes, 
Lacertes, Ueynes, Arteries 
and Ligamentes. And the roote 
of it is planted in the bone called Os 
Laude, and is tyed wyth manye ligamentes. 
The synnowes of it procede 
of the syxt payre of synnowes co~myng 
from the braine, and receaue felyng 
thereby, and mouynge of the. vij. 
payre of synnowes commynge frome 
the brayne. 
 
Undre the tonge there ben two 
veynes, whyche appeare whan the 
tong is lyfted vp. The cuttyng where 
of is verye profytable, for manye passyons 
of the throte whyche we wyll 
speake of in the cure of a quynce. And 
the tonge was pryncipally ordayned 
to speake and to conueye the meate in 
to the mouthe. And it is verye necessarye 
to the arte of Phisicke. For by 
[^f.6v^] 
taste we obtayne the knowlege of manye 
thynges called Simples. And 
the synnowes of tastyng comme from 
the fourthe and syxte payre of synnowes 
of the brayne. And in that ther 
ben .ix. lacertes procedynge frome the 
bone called Laude, and frome the addytion 
sagyttall. There is vndre the 
tonge glandulous or kernelly flesche, 
in whyche there are two lytle oryfices 
or mouthes which purge the spittell 
lyke a strayner. 
 
In the extreme ouer partes of the 
[/61./] 
iawes the eares ben situated aboute 
the bones called Uerualia, and are 
founded vpon the bones called Petrosa 
whyche ben harde and bored 
thorough. After the bone called Mendosum 
or False there ben manye innolutions, 
or inwrappynges in their 
passage goynge inwarde tyll the fyfte 
payre of synnowes of the brayne be 
touched. And by the vertue of them 
the power of hearynge is gyuen to 
the eares. And therefore the sayde 
Synnowes ben hollowe, that they 
maye the better heare all soundes. 
And aboute the eares, and extremitees 
of the iawes nature hathe produced 
a cartilage or grystell, whyche 
fynyshethe the eares. And at the extremytees 
of the sayde eares there 
ben synnowes and smalle threedes of 
veynes, and Arteryes produced circlewyse. 
Therefore the incisyon or 
cuttynge of them must be done after 
the maner of an halfe circle. 
 
There ben afterwarde in the right, 
and lyfte syde of the Necke behynde 
the eares two veynes procedynge 
frome the liuer, vndre the whyche 
there are Arteryes procedynge frome 
the harte and mounte vp by the commyssures 
or seames of the heade (as 
it is a foresayde) vnto the brayne. 
And whan they haue done theyr effecte 
in the heade they retourne towarde 
the eares. And they conduycte 
some parte of the sede to the reynes, 
and extende to the vessels of sede. 
And thys is the cause that he canne 
not engendre that hathe the veyne 
vndre the eares throughly cutte. Lyke 
wyse nature hathe produced in those 
partyes of the necke two as it were 
lytle neckes, one in the ryght syde, 
another in the lyfte, and theyr foundacyons 
ben planted in the bones of 
the heade. And therefore they ben of 
the nature of lygamentes, and they 
procede frome bothe the sydes of the 
backe bone, vnto the ende of the 
same, & they ben called longe neckes. 
And so they ben the restynge bedde 
of all the synnowes procedynge from 
the Nuke. 
 
[}The seuenth Chapytre of the 
Anatomie of spondyles, 
or of the 
chynebone.}] 
 
A Spondele is a bone 
[/62./] 
bored thorough whiche 
maketh the backe 
bone and thorough 
the hole thereof the 
Nuke passethe frome 
one ende to another. 
And the sayde spondele hathe manye 
addytions or particles descendynge 
and ascendynge, whyche successyuely 
ioyne them selues one to another 
tyll they come to the extremyte 
of the backe. And thys ordynaunce 
of dyuerse portyons or pyeces is 
as it were the conseruatyon of the 
Nuke. 
 
[^f.7r^] 
And out of eche side of those spo~diles 
sinnowes issue, which bene dispersed 
in to so~drie partes of the body, as we 
shal shewe here after. 
 
Moreouer there ben foure partes 
of spondiles in the backe (as Galene 
witnesseth) the firste is the necke: the 
seco~de the spondiles of the shoulders 
the thyrde the loynes, the fourth Os 
[/63./] 
sacru~ or the hyppe. In the firste parte 
there ben .vii. spo~diles, in the seconde 
xii. in the thyrde .v. in the fourthe .vi. 
But of the muscles, sinnowes, and 
veynes of the necke we wyl speake in 
theyr propre chapiters. 
 
[}The .viii. chap. of the Anatomie 
and figure of the eyes.}] 
 
SEynge that the eyes bene 
righte profitable to mans 
[/64./] 
body, we must serche diligently 
the anatomy of the 
same, y=t= when we know the disposition 
of them & their co~plectio~, we maye 
more easely helpe the~. Their situatio~ 
is manifeste to euery bodye. Nature 
hath ordeined two, y=t= the body might 
be guyded the better, and that yf one 
shulde be put out, the other might co~duict 
the body. And they ben me~bres 
co~pouned of seuen skinnes, & thre humours 
 
I wyl declare first their co~position 
after this sort. First fro~ the fore parte 
of the brayne procede two sinnowes 
[/65./] 
beyng holowe co~myng from the first 
paire of sinnowes of y=e= brayne, which 
assone as they bene diuided from the 
brayn by & by they ioyne them selues 
lyke a crosse, & of two one only concauite 
or holownes is made: And dep~tyng 
fro~ the skulle they seperate them 
selues from it, & ben wrapped in two 
pa~nicles and are called Nerui optici. 
And these sayde sinnowes be ioyned 
together y=t= one thyng shulde not seme 
two (as Mo~dine sayth). And eche of 
these sinnowes whan it goeth out of 
the sculle, endeth at his proper eye. 
And there is a pa~nicle compouned in 
[/66./] 
y=e= eye called sclirosis. Tha~ foloweth 
another pa~nicle called secu~dine, or second. 
[/67./] 
And about that is the humour 
called Uitreus so named bycause it 
is cleare as glasse. After thys foloweth 
y=e= thyrd tunicle or thynne skinne 
called Rhetine, hauyng the facion of 
[/68./] 
a nette. And of that nette co~sequently 
is engendred a tunicle called Tela aranea, 
bicause it hath the semblaunce 
[/69./] 
of a cobwebbe, and it comprehendeth 
the humour Cristalline, and acco~plisheth 
the roundnes of the eye. 
 
After y~ tunicle there is another called 
tunica vuea, in y=e= middeste where 
[/70./] 
of, there is a concauite or holownesse 
out of which y=e= apple of the eye procedeth, 
and openeth it selfe at pleasure. 
In the sayd concauite is the humour 
Cristalline, apprehe~ding visible thinges. 
The same tunicle co~prehendetth 
in it selfe the humour Albugineus or 
the white of the eye, which defendeth 
the humoure Cristalline. After thys 
there is another tunicle called cornea 
[/71./] 
which couereth the sayd humour, & 
kepethe it that it go not out. And it is 
called Cornea bycause it shyneth like 
an horne. And thys pannicle is harde 
and ioyneth wyth the laste pannicle 
called coniunctina, and these tye and 
embrace the eye co~mely beside the apple 
of the eye. And the pannicle called 
coniunctina hathe hys generation of 
the pannicle that couerethe the sculle 
And hereof appeareth the helpe that 
commeth of cutting the veyne which 
is ouer the eye, whan humours descende 
from the brayne. 
 
And moreouer through the hole of 
the skulle procede y=e= synnowes which 
gyue felynge & mouynge to perceyue 
what thyng hurteth. 
 
[^f.7v^] 
[}The Anatomie of the brest 
called Thorax. Cap. ix.}] 
 
AFter that we haue spoken 
[/72./] 
of the Anatomie of 
the face, if y=e= eyes, of y=e= 
necke of the spondiles, 
of the synnowes, and 
of the nuke, we wyll 
speake of the anatomie of the breste. 
The sayde breste is a station or standyng 
place of the spiritual membres. 
In whyche there bene some partes 
that conteine, and some that bene co~teyned. 
The partes that co~teyne ben 
foure, skinne, musculous flesh, y=e= dugges, 
and the bones. The partes that 
bene co~teyned are .ix. namely the hert, 
the longes, the pa~nicles, the ligame~tes, 
the sinnowes, the veynes, the arteries, 
Mery or the throte gulle, and 
Trachea arteria, or the wesaunde. 
we woll begynne at the bones. 
 
The breste is co~plete wyth .vii bones, 
and in the ende of them there is 
a gristle. And in the ouer parte, there 
[/73./] 
is a lytle thinge, lyke a lytle boxe, called 
Pixis, in whyche the forke of the 
gull is fixed. And in the nether parte 
of the same there is a softe gristle. 
And therfore it lieth vpo~ the stomake 
for the said bones are gathered together, 
& meete one wyth another. And 
to the sayd seuen bones, seuen ribbes 
ben vnited or ioyned too, of bothe sydes, 
[/74./] 
& are knytte together wyth spondiles. 
whiche ribbes bene croked, and 
the fore terminatio~ of them is called 
the brest. And on the parte of the spo~dyles, 
it is called the syde of the complete 
ribbes. And after these seue~ ribbes 
ther ben fyue on eche syde which 
bene called the false ribbes. And they 
arne ioyned together in the hyndre 
parte wyth fyue spondyles on eche 
syde, and in the fore parte they bene 
ioyned with the lacertes of the bellie. 
And they arne called false ribbes bycause 
they be not matched wyth other 
bones in the fore parte, & bicause 
they bene pliable, and giue and bende 
them selues, as the bellye wyll. 
 
[}Of the muscles of the brest.}] 
 
THe muscles of the brest after 
Auicenna bene .xviii. And of 
[/75./] 
them some haue participacion 
with the necke, some with the midriffe, 
some with y=e= ribbes, some w~ the 
back, some wyth the shulders, & some 
bene called properly the muscles of y=e= 
brest, and haue coniunction wyth the 
membres aforesayd. 
 
[}Of the ma~milles or dugges.}] 
 
THe dugges bene membres compounde 
[/76./] 
of flesh thynne, kernellye, 
whyte and spongious: to 
the whyche manye synnowes come 
from the brayne, and manye veynes 
from the liuer, and arteries from the 
herte. And therfore they haue greate 
allyaunce wyth those membres. 
 
[}Of the partes of the brest 
that conteyne.}] 
 
ABoue al thing ye must take hede 
that ye cut the sayd bones of the 
brest wyth a sharpe instrument, 
& warely, so that ye cut not the pannicle 
called mediastine, and so to come 
to the hert with diligentie. At whych 
we wyl begynne, as at the principal. 
 
The herte hathe a semblaunce of a 
[/77./] 
Pineapple, and the flesh therof is very 
harde, and full of lacertes, cheifely 
in the roote. His roote and fundation 
hath many lacertes, and harde ligamentes, 
and sinnowes compassynge 
him about. Of whych the hert is not 
touched, sauynge in the nether parte. 
And therfore after some mens iugement 
it is after the nature of a gristel 
The fleshe of the herte is harde that 
it myghte the better resiste noysome 
thynges. If the flesh had bene thinne 
[^f.8r^] 
& softe, man shulde haue ben of shorter 
lyfe. And therfore Auicenna sayth 
that the herte can not suffre solution 
of continuite wythout death. It was 
sette in the middest of the bodye that 
it shulde be as a kynge in the middest 
of a realme. And Galene sayeth that 
it is ryght in the middest of the brest, 
but Rasis sayth that it declineth som 
what to the lyft syde. And therfore in 
the lifte syde greater pulses of the arteries 
bene felt, than in the ryght. 
 
And after the sentence of the sayde 
Rasis there ben two ve~tricles about 
the herte, one in the ryghte syde another 
in the lyft. In the middest wherof 
ther is a thinne skinne called Capsula 
[/78./] 
cordis compassed wyth lytle sinnowie 
pannicles. And it is called of 
the sayde Rasis the thyrde ventricle 
And in the ryght ventricle there bene 
two holes of whyche nature hath ordeined 
one that the veynes proceding 
out of the liuer shulde conueye bloode 
to the said ve~tricle. Upon which hole 
also there ben thre pannicles, whiche 
begynne wythout and ende wythin 
that, that thynge which entreth may 
be returned. 
 
And there is another hoole of the 
veyne, whyche is a mouth, exte~dyng 
fro the same ve~tricle vnto the longes 
which mouth though it be of a veyne 
and not of an arterie, yet the tunicles 
thereof are grosse and thycke, & therfore 
it is called an arteriall veyne. 
And the tunicles or rymes of the arteries 
ben of harder substaunce than 
the tunicles proceding fro~ the veynes 
And nature hathe ordeyned them to 
be harder for a iust cause. For as long 
as the lyfe of man endureth, the arteries 
moue co~tinually. And vnder the 
sayd pa~nicle thre lytle skynnes grow 
within, and ende wythout. which nature 
hath ordeyned to receaue that, y=t= 
commeth out of the herte. 
 
In the lift ve~tricle there ben fou~de 
ii. holes. Of whiche one is the mouth 
wherout procedeth the greate arterie 
of whych al the arteries of mans body 
haue theyr generation. Moreouer 
vpon the same mouth thre pannicles 
are situated, whych begynne wythin 
and ende without, that they may answere, 
& be bowed back to that blode 
and spirite that co~meth from the hert 
whyche blode forthwyth, is diuided 
of nature through out al y=e= substau~ce 
of the hert in moderate qua~titie, and 
the rest of the blode is sent to the nouryshment 
of the herte, and it is thynned 
in the substaunce of the hert, and 
in the middle pytte it is digested, and 
purifyed, and whan it is purifyed it 
is sent to the lyfte ventricle, where of 
the blode there is a spirite engendred 
more pure and subtile than any bodie 
made of the foure elementes. 
 
And there is another hole whyche 
is the mouthe of an ample veyne goyng 
to the longes. And thorowe the 
holownes of it, the ayre is sent from 
the longes to the herte. In whych seconde 
hole there bene only two pannicles 
procedynge wythout, and endyng 
wythin whyche God hath profitably 
ordeyned to conduicte ayre to 
the herte. 
 
In the lyfte ve~tricle there is fou~de 
[/79./] 
an arterie hauynge onlye one tunicle 
named arteria venalis, whyche conueyeth 
subtile bloude procedynge fro~ 
the herte, to the longes, by whose substaunce 
it is dispersed, & it is the nouryshme~t 
of y=e= longes. And y=e= hert hath 
two litle particles, additamentes, or 
pieces lyke smal eares which susteyn 
it. One is in the ryght syde thother in 
the lyfte. 
 
[}Of the longes.}] 
 
THe longes is a membre of rare 
[/80./] 
and thynne substaunce, & spongious, 
and is tyed wyth a Pa~nicle 
[^f.8v^] 
called mediastyne, whych couereth 
the harte, that the bones of the 
brest touch it not. And there is a cane 
or pype ouer the longes called Trachea 
arteria, wherof we haue spoken 
before. The profytte of the cane is to 
drawe colde ayre, whyche ayre compasseth 
aboute mannes bodye vntyll 
it come to the herte to te~pre hys great 
heate. And by the same Cane the superfluities 
of the herte may passe out 
Wherfore y=e= coldnes of the ayre, that 
compasseth aboute mannes bodye, is 
of greate vtilitie. For it tempreth the 
herte. wythout whych the vital spirites 
shuld be choked. Therfore nature 
hath produced inspiration and respiration, 
that the herte myght be duely 
blowed vpo~, and that the ayre might 
be puryfyed, by the longes before it 
come to the herte. 
 
[}Diaphragma or the midriffe.}] 
 
DIaphragma or the mydryffe is 
one of the membres that bene 
[/81./] 
conteyned in the co~cauite of the 
brest. whose begynnynge procedethe 
from the ouer part of the brest, and in 
descendyng it stretcheth it selfe large 
and longe tyl it come to the. xii. spondyle 
of the backe. And it is a grosse 
Pannycle and musculous in the neyther 
part, and seperateth the spiritual 
membres, fro~ the membres nutrityue, 
and it hath allyaunce wyth the 
brayne, by the meanes of the synnowes, 
whyche procede from the same. 
Nature hathe ordeyned the midriffe, 
that by hys continuall mouynge it 
myght blowe vpon, & coole the hart, 
as the belowes of a smyth, whe~ they 
bene opened they receyue ayre, & whe~ 
they ben closed they dryue the wynde 
to the fyer. And for two raysons, solution 
of continuite can not be restored 
in it. The fyrste is bycause of hys 
continuall mouynge. The seconde is 
bycause it is full of sinnowes and is 
subtile. 
 
THe Pannicle called mediastyne 
[/82./] 
is in substaunce lyke the mydriffe, 
diuidynge the breste after 
hys lengthe, & therfore it passeth thorow 
y=e= middest of the lo~ges. And it is 
tyed wyth the spondiles of the backe, 
and susteyneth the longes. Thys diuision 
was made thorowe the myddest 
that the hurte of one part shulde 
not be communicated al aboute. 
 
[}Of Pleura}] 
 
PLeura is a thynne Pannicle, & 
[/83./] 
sensible whyche couerethe the 
ribbes. In whyche often times 
there is enge~dred an aposteme called 
a Pleuresie. 
 
[}The anatomie of the bellye 
and hys partes. 
Chap. x.}] 
 
VEnter or the belie 
[/84./] 
is communely take~ 
in two sortes, 
firste for the stomacke, 
& y=e= throte 
gulle, secondelye 
for the region co~teynyng 
the nutritiue membres. And 
we must knowe that the conteynyng 
partes ben Myrach and Siphac, as 
perteyninge to the fore parte, & as perteyning 
to the hyndre parte, they ben 
the bones of the fyue spondiles, the 
skynne, and the lacertous fleshe 
 
Mirach is compouned of foure 
[/85./] 
thinges of skynne, of fatte, of a fleshy 
Pannicle and of muscles growynge 
out of the herte. Siphac is a simple 
Pannicle very harde co~pouned of synowes, 
[/86./] 
fylmes, or as it were small 
heares and ligamentes ioyned wyth 
a Pannicle. Therfore there is a great 
difference betwene Mirach, and Siphac. 
For Mirach hath many partes 
[^f.9r^] 
that maye be seperated and so hathe 
not Siphac. 
 
The membres that bene called co~teined 
[/87./] 
arne .vii. the 3irbus, the guttes 
the stomake, the liuer, the mylte, the 
Mese~terium, the reynes. Of the blader, 
and of the figure of the matryce 
we wyl speake herafter in the anatomie 
of the hanches. 
 
[}The stomake.}] 
 
THe stomake is a membre compounded 
of the thre sinnowye tunicles, 
[/88./] 
hauynge many fylmes or 
as it were small threedes or heares 
accordyng to his length, and bredth. 
And it procedeth from the ouer parte 
of the midriffe, hauynge the figure of 
a rounde gourde. The necke is longe 
in the ouer parte, leanynge to the lifte 
syde, and the botome of it is conteyned 
wyth a gutte called Duodenum 
Yea and thebotome of the stomake 
is the begynnynge of the guttes. It 
is tyed behynde to the spondyles of 
the backe, wyth stronge sinnowye ligamentes 
whyche extende them selues 
accordynge as the stomake requireth. 
And the stomake was princypally 
ordeyned for the fyrst digestion. 
And there bene in it foure natural 
vertues, that is to saye Attractyue 
whan there is appetyte of meate, digestyue, 
retentyue and expulsyue. Of 
whyche vtilites it shulde be longe to 
entreate nowe 
 
[}Of the liuer}] 
 
The lyuer is sette in the ryght side 
[/89./] 
Under the ouer rybbes, towarde the 
hynder parte. And it is a fleshy membre, 
of thynne substaunce, hauing the 
semblance of congeled bloude. And it 
is hollowe in the inwarde parte, towarde 
the stomake, and bounchye 
wythout after the figure of the mone 
whan she is more than halfe ful. The 
concauite is toward the stomake and 
the bounching towarde the midriffe. 
 
And out of the hollownesse, there 
[/90./] 
groweth as it were a cane or pype 
called porta. And it is a greate veyne 
made of spermatique or seede mattier. 
Out of whych after Rasis there 
growe .vii. veynes & of them infinite, 
as the rootes of a tre, whych disperse 
themselues into sundrie places, as to 
the botome of the stomake, to the 
gutte duodenum, to the gutte called 
ieiunu~, & rectu~. which beyng deuided 
in to so~dry parties ben called veynes 
[/91/] 
Meseraice. And the office of them is 
[/92./] 
to carye the iuyce of digested meate, 
called chylus in to the veynes of y=e= lyuer, 
and the great veyne called porta 
wyth hys rootes diuidethe the sayde 
good iuyce thorowe all the lyuer. Of 
whyche substaunce or iuyce bloode is 
produced, and getteth redde coulour 
wythin the sayd veynes. 
 
Also out of the gibbosyte or bou~ch 
[/93./] 
of the liuer, there issueth a veyne called 
concaua or chilis. which with his 
rotes, (which ben many lytle veynes 
procedyng out of the same) co~ueyeth, 
and distributeth the bloode thorowe 
all the partes of the body. In whych 
y=e= thirde digestion is ended. Furthermore 
(as Galene reciteth) there bene 
thre substaunces created in the liuer, 
two superfluous, and one natural as 
in new wyne there ben thre substau~ces, 
the wyne, the fome, and the lies. 
The fome of bloud is cholere, the lyes, 
melancholie. 
 
[}The guttes.}] 
 
THe guttes bene sixe in nombre 
[/94./] 
of whyche the three vpper bene 
small, & the three beneth the nauel 
bene great, compouned of two tunicles. 
Of whych one is within, another 
w~out. That w~in is very viscous 
slymye or clammysh, that it shuld not 
be lyghtly hurted by the superfluites 
[^f.9v^] 
passyng that waye. The fyrste of the 
small guttes is it that is ioyned to y=e= 
botome of the stomacke, and is called 
portanariu~, or duodenum. It is called 
[/95./] 
portanariu~ bycause superfluites 
passe by it, as by a porte or gate, and 
duodenu~ bicause it is twelue fingers 
[/96./] 
longe. The seconde is called ieiunum 
or the greedie gutte. And in that ther 
ben more orifices or mouthes than in 
other, which giue nourishment to the 
liuer, & these two guttes lye streighte 
after the le~gth of the body. The third 
and laste of the smal guttes is called 
Inuolutu~, bycause it hathe many inuolutions, 
[/97./] 
& inwrappynges before it 
come to the gutte called Intestinum 
rectu~. And these ben as it were of the 
same quantitie wyth the gutte called 
Duodenu~. 
 
The fyrst of y=e= great guttes is called 
[/98./] 
Monoculum, bicause it hathe but 
one entrau~ce, as it were in to a purse 
by which that, y=t= goeth in, in one hour 
co~meth out agayne in another, & it is 
set on the righte syde. The seconde is 
[/99./] 
called Colon situated towarde y=e= ri3t 
side, & is stretched out a long y=e= bellye 
tyl it come to y=e= lyft side. The third is 
called Intestunu~ rectu~. And the office 
[/100./] 
of it is to receaue y=e= superfluites or excrementes 
of other guttes. And it is 
more larg tha~ thother. And in y=e= ende 
of it is the passage of all the superfluites 
of y=e= body, called anus or the arse 
hole: in which ther is a muscle which 
retayneth y=e= excreme~tes, tyl a ma~ lust 
to auoyde the same. And in the vtter 
moost parte of the arse hole, ther ben 
fyne veynes ordeyned to pourge the 
melancholyke bloude of al the body, 
called themorrodial veynes.
