[}The Preface.}] 
 
THis lamentable disease, which hath so long and so 
[/1./] 
fiercely assailed Saylers and sea-men of all sorts 
more then Land-men. It is strange in so many 
ages past, that no one Surgeon of our country 
men, hath out of his experience taken in hand 
sincerely to set downe to posterities, the true causes, signes, and 
cure therof, neither left any instructions, caueats or experiences 
for the preuention or cure of the same, yet it may bee some may 
say the cure thereof is common, and wee haue in our owne countrey 
heere many excellent remedies generally knowen, as namely 
Scuruy grasse, horse reddish rootes, Nasturtia Aquatiea, 
Worme-wood, Sorrell, and many other good meanes, the truth 
[^p.178^] 
is wee haue so, but marke how farre they extend only to the cure 
of those which liue at home, or else it may bee sayd, they also 
helpe some sea men returned from farre, who by the onely naturall 
disposition of the fresh aire & amendment of diet, nature her 
selfe in effect doth the cure without other helps, as daily it is seen. 
 
This thing therefore being so, what should I spend my time 
in teaching that method, or those medicines to the Surgeons 
Mate, which will not bee had at sea, neither if they could bee 
had, will suffice for the cure therof, where the disease raigneth 
fiercely. 
 
[/2./] 
Hauing therefore very small time, I must constraine my 
selfe to goe breefely to the businesse in hand, namely to enforme 
the Surgeons mate how hee should demeane himselfe to 
comfort his patients at sea in that most dangerous disease, nether 
will I heere striue to giue the curious Reader other content 
then this, that if hee like it not, let him amend it himselfe, which 
I should heartily reioyce to see any good man doe, knowing mine 
owne weaknesse. A learned Treatise befits not my pen, and to 
declare those good medicines, which cannot bee had at Sea, is 
but time lost. 
 
[}What the disease called the Scuruy is.}] 
 
[/3./] 
THe Scuruy is a disease of the spleene, whereby it is 
sometimes wholly stopped, sometimes onely distempered, 
sometimes also appearing with hard scyrros, swellings, 
beginning and shewing themselues in diuers parts 
of the body, but more particularly on the thighes and 
legges, causing them to seeme of a leady colour, the sharpnesse 
of which infectious humor oft offendeth the mouth 
and gummes of the diseased, and causeth the flesh thereof 
to rot and stinke. 
 
[^p.179^] 
[}The names of the disease.}] 
 
THe Scuruy called of some Caehexia vniuersalis, of other 
[/4./] 
Sceletyrbe, & of some Stomacacen, it is a chronicall 
disease, not simple but compound of many other diseases. 
 
[}The causes of the disease.}] 
 
FIrst the disease comes, as is sayd, by obstructions of the 
spleene, and by the thicknesse of the humour, not the 
multitude. 
 
Some iudicious writers doe affirme this sicknesse to 
come by the multitude of melancholike humors gathered 
in Vena Porta, by which, it is sayd, the milt doth draw vnto 
it melancholly humours, and so transporteth it from the 
milt into the ventricle. 
 
But truely the causes of this disease are so infinite and 
vnsearchable, as they farre passe my capacity to search 
them all out, sometimes wee finde this disease proceedeth 
to sea men onely, through long being at sea without touch 
of land, as it is seene in East India voyages, our men haue 
[/5./] 
it betwixt England, and the Cape de bon sperance, as they 
terme it, & at their comming on land there they presently 
grow strong againe, & are by the very fresh ayre and fresh 
food cured withoutmuch other helpe. And likewise twixt 
the Cape and the Indies, they are touched with it againe, 
and as aforesayd the fresh aire of that land, the next they 
come on and good diet together, cureth them with small 
physicall helps, and the same againe home-ward bound. 
The cheefe cause whereof is the contiuance of salt diet, either 
fish or flesh, as porke and the like, which is not to be 
auoyded at sea, as I suppose by the wit of man, another 
cause is want of sufficient nourishing food, and of sweete 
water, and also for want of Aqua vitæ, wine, beere, or other 
good water to comfort and warme their stomackes, which 
by contrary windes men are too much incident vnto in 
[^p.180^] 
long voiages howsoeuer the Marchants are carefull, prouident, 
and bountifull in that point. 
 
An other cause of this disease to the ordinarie sort of 
poore men, is want of fresh apparell to shift them with, 
which indeed amongst poore Sailers, especially a sort of 
them that are carelesse and lazie of disposition is too frequent, 
partly also by the not keeping their apparell sweete 
and dry, and the not clensing and keeping their Cabins 
sweete, this also ingendreth and increaseth the infection. 
Some charge Bisket as a cause of the Scuruie, but I am not 
of their opinion: Some say inordinate watchings are cause 
thereof: Some say extreame labour wanting due nourishment: 
Some also affirme cares and griefe to be some cause 
thereof, others affime the very heate of the aire, resoluing 
the spirits and vapors, and ingrossing the thicke humours, 
causeth the Scuruy; but what shall I amplifie further, for 
it is also true that they which haue all the helps which can 
be had for mony, and take as much care as men can deuise 
are euen by the euill disposition of the aire, and the 
course of nature, strooke with the Scuruie, yea and die 
thereof at sea and land both: yet this giueth no warrant to 
the Surgeon, or his Mate to leaue their duties vnperformed, 
for the blouds of those men which either by their wilfulnesse 
or slothfulnesse: perish vnder their charge will surely 
be required at their hands. 
 
But it is plain that this griefe is a lasie foule disease with 
obstructions of the liuer, or spleene, or of both, as also it 
appeareth that the head is much diseased, and that there is 
great obstructions in the braine, for that the eies not onely 
looke euill coulored, but also the gummes putrifie, and 
the teeth grow loose, and all the sinowie parts of the body 
beare their part in the disease, for the shrinking and 
withering of the sinowes with the great 
paines the party hath declareth 
no lesse. 
 
[^p.181^] 
[}Of the Scuruie or Scorbutum 
the signes.}] 
 
THe signes of the Scuruie are many, as namely, a generall 
lazinesse and euill disposition of all the faculties 
and parts of the body, sauing the stomake and the appetite 
which oftentimes is greater then ordinarie with 
them along time. 
 
A discouloring of the skinne as if it were fouler then ordinarie, 
with spots darker coulered then the rest, and somtimes 
also darkish blew spots. 
 
A feuer at sea commonly ends in the Scuruie, wherfore 
by the way beware of too large purging, or phlebotomie, 
which increase oft the griefe, and make it incurable: I 
speake this because I haue noted there is a fault in young 
Surgeons of forwardnesse in taking too much bloud at 
Sea. 
 
Also itching or aking of the limmes are signes of the 
griefe. 
 
Sometimes the legges falling away, and drying the 
calues of the legges growing hard and drie, as also immoderate 
swellings of the legges: also the legges and thighes 
discoullered into frekells, or spots of a durty browne sad 
couller much like the couler of a gangrenated or mortified 
member. 
 
Stinking of the breath. 
 
Great obstructions of the liuer, or spleene, or both, and 
in the exercising of their bodies their limmes, and their 
spirit failing them. 
 
Shortnesse and difficultie of breathing, especially when 
they mooue themselues, but lying still finde little griefe 
or paine. 
 
[^p.182^] 
Their eies of a leady colour, or like darke violets. 
 
Great swellings in the face, legges, and ouer all the body; 
palenesse, or a foule pale couler in the face. Swellings 
of the gummes, rottennesse of the same, with the ishewing 
of much filthy bloud and other stinking corruption 
thence, loosenesse of the teeth: Also some are troubled 
with an extreame costiuenesse that for 14 daies together 
they go not to stoole once, wherefore the Surgeon is constrained 
with an instrument to take out the excrements to 
auoide death, after which extreame costiuenesse often followeth 
a great flux of bloud, and a painefull: also many 
haue stoppings of the vrine, or at the least making lesse 
water in two daies then the party drinketh in one day. 
 
A coldnesse and stifnesse of the sinowy parts, chiefly 
of the legges. 
 
Some also haue their muskells, yea and sinowes of their 
thighes, armes, and legges so wasted away that there seemeth 
to be left only the skinne couering the bones. 
[/6./] 
 
Also it is manifest that diuers of those which haue been 
opened after death, haue had their liuers vtterly rotted. 
 
Others haue had their liuers swolne to an exceeding 
greatnesse, some the spleene extreamly swolne, others 
haue beene full of water, others their lungs putrified and 
stunke whilst they haue liued, these and diuers other signes 
too many all to be mentioned here, doe afflict poore sea-men, 
which often are past mans helpe, in such place and 
time as they happen, the cure whereof resteth only in the 
hands of the Almightie. And yet to any man of iudgement 
it may seeme a wonder how a poore miserable man, 
comming on land from a long voiage euen at the point of 
death, namely, swolne sometimes to an vnreasonable 
greatnesse not able to lift a legge ouer a straw, nor scarce 
to breath by reason of strong obstruction, yet in a few 
daies shall receiue the fulnesse of former health, yea with 
little or no medicine at all. 
 
The cure of this disease, as a famous writer named Iohannes 
Echthius in a treatise de scorbuto affirmeth, consisteth 
[^p.183^] 
chiefly in foure things, namely in opening obstructions, 
euacuating the offending humors, in altering the property 
of them, and in comforting and corroborating the parts 
late diseased. 
 
Iohannes Vierius another famous writer ascribeth the 
whole cure of the Scuruie to the herbe Spoone worte. 
One Olaus Magnus a Swedon writer, in his fifteenth 
booke, and fiftie one Chapter, intreating of this griefe attributeth 
the whole cure therof to be in Absinthio or wormwood, 
namely, to drinke much of the infusion thereof, 
[/7./] 
and also of the salt of the same: and one chiefe part of the 
cure of the Scuruie (saith he) consists in good diet, but 
the sea-men are inioyned to that onely the Ship affordeth, 
which the better and sounder their prouisions of victualls 
are, the more their men stand in health; and the contrarie 
not onely bringeth many diseases, but maketh the diseases 
which happen very hard to be cured, therefore I may spare 
labour in writing what broths or herbs serue best where no 
fresh foode can be gotten: the Surgeon and his Mate must 
[/8./] 
therfore, seeing he is at sea depriued of one principall help 
in that cure, namely, fresh meat and good drinke, be diligent 
to call for such comfortable things as are by the great 
care and bountie of the Marchants prouided for sick men, 
or those which incline thereunto, whereof in each Shippe 
is a good proportion both of wine, sugar, spices and other 
comfortable things, and to see they haue it in due time and 
measure: and likewise to complaine to the Gouernours 
if they be withheld from the same, or if any man abuse 
himselfe by misse diet: yea and oftentimes, namely morning 
and euening to seeke for weake and poore men in 
their Cabins, or so soone as they are missing at their messes 
to inquire for them, and to see their Cabins be sweet, and 
their prouisions according, or to moue and intreat the Master, 
or Gouernour of the Shippe for redresse in such cases, 
for feare of a generall infection. And whereas the first 
part of this cure is in the opening of obstructions, it is 
therefore fit in the beginning of the griefe to giue a lenitiue 
[^p.184^] 
glister, then the next day if the party be strong open 
a veine, but beware, as is said, of taking too much bloud 
away at once, especially where the liuer is weake or stopped, 
and where men want good nutriment, for many euills 
ensue thereby, The next day following his bleeding 
if he can beare it, and if that his disease be with a swelling 
or fulnesse, giue him a dosse of the pills of Euphorbium 
or otherwise of pipula ruffi, or of Cambogia, and make 
him some comfortable spoone meate, such as you can 
make at sea; namely, an oatmeale caudell would not bee 
a misse of a little beere or wine, with the yolke of an egge, 
and a little sugar made warme and giuen him to drinke, 
or any comfortable breath made with currants and other 
fruite, or spices moderately taken, or with sugar, or as the 
shippe can afford, a barley water for his ordinary drinke 
were not amisse, with some few drops of Cinamon water 
therein, and also some iuice or sirupe of lemons therein, 
or a few drops of oyle of vitriole and some sugar, and giue 
him in his drinke by way of infusion, dried wormewood 
good store for it is very wholesome. 
 
Further the Surgeon and his Mate must not faile to 
perswade the Gouernor or Purser in all places where they 
touch in the Indies and may haue it, to prouide themselues 
of iuice of Oringes, limes, or Lemons, and at Banthame 
of Tamarinds: Also sometime though a man bee 
well, a comfortable caudell made with some wine, spices, 
sugar, and the yolke of an egge were very good, for these 
are helps in that case as well to preuent the disease, as also 
to helpe it when it comes. 
 
And further experience teacheth which I haue oft found 
true, that where a disease most raineth, euen there God 
hath appointed the best remedies for the same greefe if it 
be his will they should be discouered and vsed: and note 
[/9./] 
for substance, the Lemmons, Limes, Tamarinds, Oringes, 
and other choyce of good helpes in the Indies which you 
shall finde there doe farre exceed any that can be carried 
thither from England, and yet there is a good quantity of 
[^p.185^] 
Iuice of Lemmons sent in each ship out of England by the 
[/10./] 
great care of the Marchants, and intended onely for the 
releefe of euery poore man in his neede, which is an admirable 
comfort to poore men in that disease: also I find we 
haue many good things that heale the Scuruy well at land, 
[/11./] 
but the Sea Surgeon shall doe little good at Sea with them, 
neyther will they indure. The vse of the iuice of Lemons 
is a precious medicine and wel tried, being sound & good, 
let it haue the chiefe place for it will deserue it, the vse 
whereof is: It is to be taken each morning, two or three 
spoonfuls, and fast after it two houres, and if you adde one 
spoonefull of Aquavitæ thereto to a cold stomacke, it is the 
better. Also if you take a little thereof at night it is good 
to mixe therewith some suger, or to take of the syrup thereof 
is not amisse. Further note it is good to be put into 
each purge you giue in that disease. Some Surgeons also 
giue of this iuice daily to the men in health as a preseruatiue, 
which course is good if they haue store, otherwise it 
[/12./] 
were best to keepe it for neede. I dare not write how good 
a sauce it is at meat, least the chiefe in the ships waste it in 
the great Cabins to saue vineger. In want whereof vse the 
iuice of Limes, Oringes, or Citrons, or the pulpe of Tamarinds: 
and in want of all these vse oyle of Vitrioll as many 
drops as may make a cup of beere, water or rather wine if 
it may be had, onely a very little as it were sower, to which 
you may also adde sugar if you please, or some sirups, according 
to your store and the necessity of that disease, for 
of my experience I can affirme that good oyle of Vitrioll 
is an especiall good medicine in the cure of the Scuruy, as 
also in many other greefes, the which in another place is 
noted. Further a decoction of Branne and therein Almonds 
ground, adding Cinamon and Rosewater a little, 
and some Suger were very comfortable now and then to 
be taken to refresh the stomacke. And as touching the 
Tamarinds brought from the Indies they are to be eaten 
of themselues as the substance of them is, namely to eat 
them as you would prunes, and being made into conserues, 
[^p.186^] 
eat them as other Conserues on the point of a knife 
sucking out the substance, and putting forth the stalkes or 
stones thereof, some dissolue them in wine or water, and 
worke out the substance of them therein, and cast away the 
rest taking onely that which is pure: one may vse this medicine 
so oft as ye please without danger or harme, onely 
[/13./] 
if hee feare a fluxe of the belly, or haue a weakenes in the 
raines, let him not eat too much of the Tamarinds. Also 
the Electuary Diatrionpiperion giuen each morning a little 
[/14./] 
on the point of a knife fasting, and last, namely at the party 
his going to bed, is a great preseruatiue; for it doth warme 
and coroborate the stomacke, and preserueth from the 
Scuruy, and is very comfortable to bee giuen to any one 
that is diseased with the same, or subiect thereto. And the 
Theriaca Diatesseron is yet better, for it hath an especiall 
vertue in curing that disease. Also Venice Treakle, Mithridate, 
and London Treakle preserue well from this disease 
daily taken fasting, and so doth conserue of Roses and Berberies 
mixed with a little oyle of Vitriole, and giuen on 
the point of a knife. 
 
Greene Ginger is also very good to comfort the stomacke, 
and so are all sorts of Myrabolans Condite, and 
also all sorts of strong Cordiall waters, but chiefly good 
Rosasolis and good wormwood water, yea and very good 
Aquavitæ helpeth well, Currants and Reysons of the Sun 
are likewise very good. 
 
Also all kinds of Spices moderately taken are good, and 
so is good wine a very good preseruer of the body from 
this disease, with also the continuance of fresh diet, which 
is hard to bee gotten at sea, the excesse of which good 
things is as dangerous. 
 
The principall Laxatiue medicine which I would aduise 
in this case is pills of Euphorbium wherewith the body 
being swolne and watery, you may at your pleasure make 
euacuation thereof: these purge also by vrine very well 
the dosse being +Q +s, or at the most +q ij. These are the fitter 
for that disease, because they purge not alone water, but 
[^p.187^] 
also by their great warmth, they comfort and warme the 
stomacke and intralls. 
 
These I aduise the Surgeons mate to vse, as is said, where 
the body aboundeth with ouer much cold and crude humidity, 
but let your dosse alwaies respect the strength of 
[/15./] 
the patient, for any strong purging is not good in the Scuruy: 
all sodaine and strong euacuations are to be auoided. 
Also Aquilla Laxatiue is a very good purge in this case, 
namely eight or ten graines thereof taken in a cup of wine. 
It cureth also all wormes of the body, and killeth them 
wheresoeuer they be. But if the stomacke onely bee oppressed 
with the greefe in this disease, I first giue a dose of 
pills called Pilule Ruffi, namely +Q j: you shall finde them 
to be very good. 
 
Note further, that if any dose or the whole masse of 
pils in the Chest, such time as you would administer them 
be growne too hard, then you may dissolue them with 
any sirup you haue, or with good honey a very little, 
namely one onely drop will serue to dissolue one dose at 
once if the masse prooue too liquid, you may roule it in 
[/16./] 
some of the Puluis Arthreticus till it be hard enough. Also 
the moderate vse of Veriuice, Vineger, or Oximell hath 
beene found very good in this case. 
 
Furthermore, if you see cause, certaine daies after you 
haue giuen of any your former Laxatiues, you may giue a 
[/17./] 
sweat to the patient in his bed, namely you may giue him 
a scruple of Mithridate, Venice Treakle, or London Treakle or 
Diatesseron, and mixe therewith if you haue it eight or ten 
graines of the Diaphoretice, and being but ordinarily couered, 
he shall sweat sufficiently if he stirre not too much. 
Also the sweating in moist baths I confesse to be good medicines 
in this case, though not well to bee performed at 
Sea for the ordinary men. And whereas one accident 
dangerous in this disease is extreme Costiuenesse as is mentioned, 
with also stopping of Vrine: the remedies for the 
Costiuenes, is first that you attempt to mooue the belly by 
a lenitiue glister as is said, made rather of a slimy decoction 
[^p.188^] 
or medicine which might leaue no sharpe Astringent 
or desiccatiue quality behind it, yea though it purge not 
much, for the sharp Purgers after their working cause often 
a more Costiuenes then was before, or by their violence 
cause a weakenes in the stomacke and intrals, whence 
followeth a fluxe, wherefore for glisters at Sea in great Costiuenesse, 
where the Apothecaries shop and Cheap-side is 
not at hand, make a slimy decoction of Altheæ rootes or 
[/18./] 
Comfery rootes, or in want thereof, of Linseeds & Fenogreeke 
bruised, of each +o +s: in want thereof, of Bran +o ij. to 
the decoction being strained, adde of species Hiera Pigra 
+Q ij of salt halfe a spoonfull, of honey as much, of oyle two 
spoonfulls: all these put together, let the decoction mentioned 
be so fitted that all may be but one wine pint, and 
administer it with the Siring, beeing of a iust temper in 
warmth, but if you intend not to haue it purge much, 
leaue out the species hiera pigra, and it will giue 2, or 3. 
stooles. You may for an ordinary glister well also take one 
quart of the broth from the beefe kettle, adding thereto of 
linseed +Q ij, comfry rootes and March mallow rootes if they 
may be had, a small quantity of Aniseed and fennell seed, 
ana +Q ij, boyle these halfe an houre, then adde honey and 
common oyle of each a spoonefull, & giue one wine pint 
of this for a glister: but if you see it worke not but come away 
without excrement, the former recited will doe well, 
or make an other stronger, namely ad colaquintida +Q ij, in 
the beginning of the decoction to the aforesaid decoctio~, 
prouided there be no inflammation in Longauu~, or intestiuu~ 
rectum, nor any excoriation, which by the patient his complaint 
is knowne: this decoction being boyled and ready 
to be administred, you may yet adde of the species Hiera 
+Q 2 thereto, or of the Puluis Arthreticus +Q j. rather, for it 
[/19./] 
inflameth not, it were best in my opinion to striue in this 
disease by glisters to giue but one or two stooles at one 
time, for sharpe glisters offend much. Therefore though 
I shew what you may doe, yet be well aduised in doing of 
it. Also of pills of Euphorbium, haue a care you giue them 
[^p.189^] 
not where there is an inflammation or inward heate in the 
guts, in such a case, the Aquilla Laxatiua will be a better 
[/20./] 
medicine, which will both temper the inward heate and 
help to heale the interalls, and yet wil purge him well, and 
doth not binde him againe presently, and prouoketh also 
vrine very well, for Aquilla Laxatiua will often cause naturall 
loosenes, certaine daies after the taking thereof, and 
will purge water very much both by stoole and vrine: and 
because as is said, extreme costiuenes is great hurt to the 
body, the Surgeon must by his best care to the patient, 
seeke to preuent it, both by teaching him to doe his best 
for his owne health, & to amend the same by obseruing 
good customes and diet: by customes, namely that hee 
faile not daily, once a day at the least to offer himselfe to 
stoole, and doe his best to vrge some excrement to come, 
and somewhat to force his body thereunto if occasion be, 
and to keepe one and the same hower daily as neere as hee 
can: I know by proofe it helpeth much, and for diet to 
vse also as neere as he can those things which hee findeth 
procure an inward slipperinesse and loosenesse in the guts, 
pease, oatmeale, and rice doe somewhat thereunto, prouided 
they be very well boiled, and the adding currants 
[/21./] 
thereto is the better, and oyle and butter are good helpes, 
[/22./] 
but at land where it may be had, all kindes of fresh diet almost 
are good in that case, for by the leauing onely Sea 
diet, the body refresheth it selfe sodainly through benefit 
of nature and the fresh aire, and easily becommeth naturally 
loose, and then the difficulty is ended. The eating 
of Tamarinds is likewise a good thing in that case. 
 
What I haue written here plainly, touching meane and 
simple glisters; I would not be mistaken, as if I did it out 
of ignorance or disdaine of better medicines, for I were 
worse then foolish if I would reiect, detract or disswade 
from the good vse of decoctions of hearbes, seedes, & c. 
with the additions of Electuaries, Laxatiue Sirupes and 
the like which I haue in daily vse at home vpon each iust 
occasion: yet many of the ancient Artists of worthy memory 
[^p.190^] 
which I could rehearse, haue in former ages vsed 
for glisters only water and salt with oyle, and some others 
haue added honey, and it is manifest that new milke alone 
is a good comfortable glister with the yolke of an egge, 
and a little course sugar added. 
 
And you may also many times saue a labor of giuing a glister 
by a suppository, which is either to be made of a long 
peece of Allum scraped smooth, or of a candles end, or of 
a peece of hard sope, or of honey and salt sodden till it bee 
so hard that it will breake being colde, which being yet hot 
may be rowled & made vp of the greatnesse of a finger, & 
administred: of any of these, I say, you may make a suppository 
as long and bigge as a finger or lesse, and thrust it 
vp into Ano, & let the party keep this medicine one houre 
at the least in his body (if he possibly can.) Further note 
this generall rule concerning Glisters, let a Glister neuer exceede 
[/23./] 
the quantity of one wine pint, let it rather want one 
quarter, especially when you giue it to a costiue body, or a 
ful body, he shal be much the abler & the willingler to keep 
it the iust time. Further beware it be not too hot nor too 
[/24./] 
colde, for the guts are tender parts, so hot as pisse new 
made, or a very little rather warmer is the true temper. But 
if you perceiue the Intestinum rectum or Arse-gut, to bee 
excoriated or inflamed, in such a case vse no salt nor salt 
broathes, nor strong Laxatiues, as Euphorbium, Agaricum, 
Hiera Pigra, Coloquintida, or the like. If you find the Longanum 
[/25./] 
or Arse-gut to be clung, or hard stopped with excrement, 
you may put a smal greasie or oily clout on the end 
of your glister-pipe only ouer the holes therof, when you 
put it into the body, and thrust it into the head of the pipe 
then draw backe a little your hand and deliuer in your medicine, 
and if you see cause, and that it will not easily deliuer, 
force it somewhat. Also when your medicine is all in, 
and that you would draw out your instrument againe, doe 
[/26./] 
it quickly, and let the party turne him on his backe, and he 
shall keepe the medicine in the better. In cases of excoriations 
or inflammations of the intrailes, in Glisters vse 
[^p.191^] 
Deere suet +o ij. for one glister, and in want thereof, Axungia 
ouina vel porcina, I meane sheep or swines fat, and let the 
decoction whereof the glister is made, be onely of branne, 
and without any other addition, aud giue now and then 
such a glister, I meane once a day, for two or three daies, 
after you may adde thereto some small astringent medicines, 
as Succus Acatiæ +o j. or Gales +Q ij. or Balustians 
+o +s. or Myrabolans, +Q iij. euen as you see cause, for these 
helpe to heale the guts well. 
 
[}Of Lotions.}] 
 
COncerning Lotions to the mouth and throat of the 
diseased, they must be sharpe and very astringenr, I 
meane them especially which concerne the cure of the 
[/27./] 
gummes in the Scuruie, if the gummes therfore be swolne, 
that they hang ouer the teeth, stinke or be putrified, they 
must be very well lanced or scarified, and after hard rubbed 
with a linnen or wollen cloth, wrapped about the fore 
finger and wet in some strong restringent or Stiptick Lotion 
very hot, as is the ordinarie Lotion of Allum, Honey 
and Hearbes, adding thereto a double quantitie of Allum, 
and a little salt peeter, or gun-powder for a neede is good, 
& if it be not sufficiently strong, make a stronger decoction 
of coperas in water, adding salt peeter with a little honey, 
if you haue it, or Mell Rosarum, with also a little strong 
vineger, you may also put oile of Vitrioll a little thereto, 
but that it hath one euill qualitie in hurting and softning 
the teeth, wherefore beware of it, and if you vse it, do but 
onely touch the gummes with it once and no more, and it 
will doe much good: and if you please, also Aqua Fallopis 
is good, but because it is made with sublimed Mercurie, it 
is not without danger, and is also of a loathsome taste and 
smell, and offendeth the stomacke very much, but I know 
it to be held by many for a great secret, but as for my selfe 
for reasons rehearsed, I vse it not but aduise rather that w=ch= 
is strong eyther of the Coperas, Allome, or Salt-peeter, 
[^p.192^] 
for they hurt not the teeth at all as doth the oyle of Vitrioll, 
and so doth Aqua fortis very much, or you may 
make a Lotion thus: +R Coperas, white, greene or blew +o ij. 
water one pound or thereabout, Honey one spoonefull, 
boyle these to the consumption of one third or halfe, then 
take of Lapis Medicamentosus, or salt-peeter +o +s, and if you 
haue no honey, take Suger, or iuice of Licorice, or Licorice 
boyled therein for to make it pleasant in taste, or without 
for a need you may vse it, or the Lapis Medicamentosus 
dissolued into faire water, maketh an excellent Lotion for 
the putriffed gums. 
 
Touching good outward remedies for the cure of this 
[/28./] 
greefe, bathes, fomentations, with also good oyles, vnguents, 
cerotes, cataplasmes, or emplasters, are each necessary 
in their due times, prouided they be of comfortable 
ingredients, namely those which minister warmth and 
nourishment to the diseased parts, and open the pores obstructed, 
all such, I say, are most fit, prouided they bee alwaies 
applyed very warm, and the party be layd and kept 
warme vpon it. Further if it bee a swolne member, then 
[/29./] 
this following bathe to foment the member, will bee 
good, namely a Lixiuium made of fresh water and ashes, 
and being onely but reasonable sharpe, (for too sharp 
[/30./] 
of the ashes, will ouer heat, yea & excoriate) this done and 
cleered, boile some hot hearbes, flowers and seedes fitting 
therein, such are Camomile, Mellilote, Dill, Wormewood, 
Balme, Rosemary, Time, Sage, Bay-leaues, Bay-berries, 
Iuniper berries, Anis-seede, Fennell, Coriander, 
Carraway, Dill seedes, or the the like: these ingredients, or 
those of them which may be had, and let them be boyled 
a little therein. and either stupes of woollen or linnen clothes 
wet therein or put the ingredients into bagges after 
the decoction is made with them, and the place well fomented 
therewith, and so laid to sweat with some of the 
hearbes in the same bagges well wrung out and hot applied, 
till the next dressing. But if the disease proceede with 
stiffenesse and hardnesse of the sinewes, then forbeare the 
[^p.193^] 
Lixiuium, I meane put no ashes thereto, and make the decoction 
of the mentioned ingredients, boyled in the 
broath of the beefe-kettle, in wine, beere, or water for a 
neede, adding some salt, and likewise, if you haue it, Linseede 
oyle, neats-foot oile, sheepes-foot oile, or oile of almonds, 
oyle of chamomile, Dill or earth-wormes, of 
Bayes, of Lillies or some one of them. 
 
Also where you can haue it, a good bathe of the bloud 
[/31./] 
of beasts, either cowes, horses, asses, goats, or sheeps bloud 
is exceeding good, namely, to put the legges of the patient, 
[/32./] 
yea and his body too, if it may bee, into a tub made 
fitting, and the blood kept warme, part thereof being still 
kept hot on the fire, and renew therewith the bath still, as 
it cooleth with the warme blood, for some reasonable 
time, this restoreth and comforteth mightily the decayed 
spirits. Milke of it selfe is also good to be vsed in that kind 
[/33./] 
where it may be had. 
 
[}Of Oyles thereto.}] 
 
OYles good to annoynt, which are Oleum Chamamillæ, 
[/34./] 
Laurini, Anethi or Lumbricorum, with a little Spike 
oyle, oyle of Turpentine, oyle of Nutmegs pressed out, 
oyle of Peeter, oyle of Exitor or oyle of Iuniper, or one 
[/35./] 
of the same mixed with them, or some good Aquavitæ, 
& to vse strong frication with warmesoft hands long continued, 
helpeth much. 
 
[}Vnguents.}] 
 
GOod Vnguents to help these greefes, in my opinion, 
[/36./] 
are euery warme and comforting Vnguent in vse in 
the Surgeons chest, but I haue had especiall triall of an 
Vnguent, the composition whereof shall be heereafter described, 
which is named Contra Scorbutum, as also of the 
[/37./] 
Vnguentum Populeon, I meane the same composition Valerius 
Cordus hath described, for I finde it to bee very good: 
[^p.194^] 
but you may well say, how doth hee contradict himselfe, 
which euen now aduiseth warming Vnguents, and presently 
reciteth Populeon for one, which is knowen to bee 
colde, but though I haue haste, let mee I pray thee answer 
for my selfe in that one poynt, which I know to be a principall 
Arcanum in healing not looked vnto: many a medicine 
hath a seeming shew to be colde, & yet doth contrary 
effects, witnesse Quicksiluer, Iuyce of Lemmons, Vitrioll, 
[/38./] 
oyle of Vitrioll, Salt peeter, Allum, Sorrell, and diuers others 
which I could recite, all which may easily bee prooued, 
either hot or colde, by their seuerall strong operations 
and effects which they performe: as for example, to begin 
with Quicksiluer, it is affirmed to be extreame cold of infinite 
writers, and his repercussiue quality sheweth the 
[/39./] 
same as also in repelling and cooling hot tumors: with also 
the variety of colde diseases and contractions Podagricall 
and Chyrurgicall, procured therby to diuers artificers 
which worke much therewith, as namely to guilders, Foilers 
of looking-glasses, and the like Trades-men, which 
sheweth the same to be cold. It also sheweth it selfe to bee 
hot diuersly, as namely in that it is so extreame subtill and 
penetratiue, so inuisible to enter the body (per poros cutis) 
and being in the body, so volatill and busie, so causticke & 
corrosiue, so extreame Laxatiue, so diaphoreticke, so diaueriticke, 
so mundificatiue, so incarnatiue and so sigillatiue 
or siccatrizing, as the like medicine by the art or wit 
[/40./] 
of man was neuer found out: iuyce of Lemmons was euer 
reputed a colde medicine, prescribed and giuen dayly 
by the Physicians in burning and pestilentiall feuours, 
and that with great reason, and good successe euen to 
this day, and yet to that notable, and colde, and terrible 
disease of the Scuruy, how excellent hath it been 
approued, how then in these two recited medicines 
holde the old Axiome Similia conseruantur similibus & contraria 
contrariorum remedia sunt? euen as true as vox populi 
vox dei, pepper is hot in the mouth and cold in the mawe; 
if I would desire truely to coole and temper the boyling 
[^p.195^] 
of the bloud inwardly, which I my selfe would take, yea 
were it vpon the safegard of my owne life I would take 
fiue or sixe drops of good oyle of Vitrioll in a draught of 
[/41./] 
faire water with a little sugar, a drop or two of Rose-water 
and as much wine vineger, marke well my words if thou 
knowest not these medicines they are worth knowing, or 
+Q j of pepper, salt niter, which is also called Lapis prunella, 
in the like liquor, and for want of the sugar, rose-water, 
or vineger of it selfe, or with the water only for a 
neede: I haue often prooued them so true coolers that 
they haue staied the Hemoragie or bleeding at the nose, 
the latter whereof shall seldome faile if you by outward 
[/42./] 
meanes proceede rationally by applying to the forehead 
cold and astringent things, as also to the nape of the neck: 
also a large spung wet in cold water and applied to his secret 
parts is good, or let him hold or put his members into 
a boule of cold water, also binding hard the armes and 
legges is very good to stay bleeding at the nose; and one 
of the surest remedies but last to be attempted in Hemoragie 
or bleeding at the nose, is to open a veine in the arme 
on the same side. Thus it may plainely appeare that two 
of the recited medicines are cold: now to proue those 
two hot, I will not spend many words, call to minde that 
of Vitrioll and Salt peeter Aqua fortis is made, which by 
[/43./] 
his heate and penetrating force, teareth to peeces and dissolueth 
the strongest mettalls presently, deuoureth & vtterly 
destroyeth cloths woollen and linnen, or put but 
good oyle of Vitrioll into an vlcer, or to the whole skin 
and tell me halfe an houre after what a cold feuor the Patient 
had: or put fire to crude salt niter alone and marke 
[/44./] 
the conclusion, namely it will prooue it selfe wholly combustible, 
and therefore hot: as I suppose likewise the herbe 
Sorrell, it is a cold herbe esteemed at least in the first if not 
[/45./] 
in the second degree, and yet consider well if you seeke 
quickly to ripen and bring to suppuration an Apostume 
you shall finde it a most excellent speedy remedie: I conceiue 
therfore that it is not by his coldnesse it doth that effect, 
[^p.196^] 
for that is not common nor rationall, and therefore 
to conclude my degression as Ozwaldus Crollius a late learned 
writer saith in his Preface Admonitorie to his booke 
[/46./] 
called Bazilla Chimica Simplicium: qualitates non semper 
considerandæ sed earum arcana, The simple and apparant qualilities 
of Medicines are not alwaies alone to be respected, but rather 
their mysteries or hidden vertues. 
 
Thus much in defence of the temperament of some 
priuate Medicines working strange and seuerall effects, 
[/47./] 
wherein the mysteries of our God in his diuine prouidence 
farre do excell whatsoeuer things else, shewing mans wisedome 
meere foolishnesse, wherefore to him for euermore 
be praise, Amen. 
 
[/48./] 
The warme vnguents are to be vsed where you see apparant 
neede by reason of the coldnesse of the part, the 
Populeon where there is paine though no manifest signe 
of a hot disease appeare, and doubtlesse it will worke good 
effect to your comfort, yea though you thinke the disease 
be not cold, and therefore neede a more warming Medicine, 
Vnguentum Dialthea is one of the best vnguents, and 
Martiatum is another, Oleum laurini is also good, and if 
you list to adde some more califying oyles, take of oyle of 
Speeke, of Terbinthine, or Petreolum, but good warme 
application and strong frication is the meane, and warme 
[/49./] 
keeping. Of medicines to be applied to the Spleene, Liuer, 
or stomake outwardly, the vnguent pectorale described 
is very good warme to annoint those parts, whose description 
with the rest you shall finde, and to lay also ouer the 
whole part agrieued the Emplastrum mellilote prosplene, 
whose description is expressed in the Dispensatory, for 
want of which Plaster Emplastrum cumini is good. 
Also the well annointing with oyle of Nutmegges, or 
Mace adding a few drops of oyle of Cloues Chymicall 
doth much comfort, keeping the grieued part extraordinary 
warme. 
 
[^p.197^] 
[}Of Vlcers in those that haue 
the Scuruie.}] 
 
THe Vlcers which happen to them which haue this 
disease are many waies different from the generall 
formes and differences of ordinary Vlcers in bodies not 
touched with this disease, all which I haue here no time to 
amplifie. But because this disease hath two generall and 
[/50./] 
principall differences of appearance, namely some men 
deceased with the Scuruie are swollen exceedingly, as in 
the dropsie: Others their outward limmes withred, consumed, 
and dried vp, their sinowes shrunke and growne 
hard, though the Vlcers in the one and the other should 
[/51./] 
be like in shew, yet doubtlesse the healing of these Vlcers 
will be found very much different, wherefore for one generall 
note remember that the Vlcers in the full and hydropicall 
bodies will require more desiccatiue medicines, 
as namely the Vnguentum diapompholigos, de minio, Vnguentum 
album Camphoratum and the like: And the other kind the 
Vnguentum basilicon incarnatiuu~, and the Arceus linament 
and the like to those. Some sea Surgeons haue commended 
to me of their practise the vse of Vesicatory medicines, 
namely Contharides in painfull swolne limmes, which I 
[/52./] 
leaue to the practise of others further to commend the 
same, my selfe hauing reserued it as a great secret from a 
Surgeon my friend, but made no such experiences thereof 
my selfe. 
 
And further touching the cure of Vlcers in this disease 
[/53./] 
vntil the obstructions of the liuer and spleene be remoued, 
those Vlcers giue no place to good healing; wherefore 
since notwithstanding they must bee carefully attended 
for conscience sake, I aduise that all sharpe and violent 
medicines be shunned, and all soft and anodine things 
[^p.198^] 
applied that you know or can learne, prouided they bee 
warrantable medicines, for otherwise they not only striue 
[/54./] 
against a streame, but put your Patient to needlesse disquiet, 
and thereby increase this disease. 
 
I haue here in part shewed the Surgeons mate my opinion 
concerning the cure of the Scuruie, to which hee 
may ioyne his owne and other mens experience, where he 
can gaine instructions worth following, together with his 
owne daily practise, which, if he be wise, he may likewise 
set downe, onely let me aduise the young practitioner that 
[/55./] 
sometimes (as my selfe haue experienced) the scuruie produceth 
such extreame costiuenesse, as neither suppositorie, 
glister, or any Laxatiue medicine whatsoeuer will auaile, 
but that the excrements must be drawne out of the Longanum, 
or the Intestinum rectum with an instrument, for 
they will be like drie lumps of clay, or hard sheepes treckles, 
as they terme them, the which instrument I haue appointed 
and is an easie and a fit instrument, called by me 
Spatula Mundani, which instrument being a little warmed, 
is then to be annointed with oyle, and so gently put into 
Ano to draw out the excrements, and to make way for the 
glister-pipe, which, when it hath clensed some sixe inches, 
or fiue inches, you may assay by a glister againe. Furthermore 
it sometime happeneth, that by the long remaining 
of the excrements in the Longanum, the gut is either excoriated, 
or at the least inflamed. In such a case you may 
take notice that you forbeare salt, as is said, and all sharpe 
heating things in your glisters, as Coloquintida, Hierapigra, 
[/56./] 
Scamony, Agaricum, Euphorbium, and the like: and content 
your selfe to administer for the first, a glister made onelie 
of a decoction of Bran alone, or of Mallowes, or of Comfry 
[/57./] 
rootes small cut, or Linseeds bruised with +o ij of Deere 
suet, Vnguentum Diapompholigos, or as much populeon 
[/58./] 
or Vnguentum album, as is said, and rather if you finde 
that helpe not, giue a dose of Aquilla Laxatiua which will 
purge easily without any offence at all, and helpe to heale 
the gut, and this course is better then by sharpe glisters to 
[^p.199^] 
purge, which will offend the gut, and after the said purge it 
will not be amisse if you see occasion, to giue a like glister 
[/59./] 
againe as before, and note that if in the glister some of the 
ingredients should be wanting, you may neuer the lesse 
proceed with the rest with good profit, prouided if you 
haue better you vse them, neither doe I heere intend strictly 
to enioyne the Surgeons mate to my rule, but if hee 
haue better, let him vse it, and forget mine in the name of 
God. 
 
Moreouer, if the patient his disease be in the forme of a 
consumption, the body being dried vp as it were, or with 
[/60./] 
shrinking of the sinewes: then if you intend to purge the 
party, giue him pills called Pilulæ Ruffi for the first remedie, 
but if he complaine much of paines in his ioynts, then 
a dose of Puluis Arthreticus will do best, or purge him with 
Aquila Laxatiua, it is also a general good purge at al times, 
[/61./] 
and almost in all cases, though best in the French Pox and 
Dropsie. And though I haue formerly touched the forms 
of some Cataplasmes, yet for that there hath beene much 
good found in the application of this Cataplasme made 
being of warming, comforting and anodine medicines, I 
[/62./] 
thought good to note it, which is asfolloweth. +R the flowers 
of Cammomile, Mellilot flowers, Wormwood & Hipericon 
[/63./] 
and Balme, of each M. j, Bran M. j.ij, Linseed, Fenigreeke, 
of each +o +s. Comfrey and Mallow roots, of each 
+o +s, barly meale +o ij. bruise the herbs, and boyle these in 
milke, beere, or water, then adde of oyle of Camomile, 
Dialthæ, oyle of Dill, of each +o ij, Axungiæ +o iiij, apply it 
warme: note likewise, that where you haue not all these 
recited ingredients, yet that you take so many of them as 
you haue, and try their force, for if a few will do the busines, 
as sometimes it will, it were vaine & wast to vse many. 
 
Sometimes for a need you may make good vse of a decoction 
of Bisket in wine or beere, which warme applied 
will wonderfully comfort a weake limme, and asswage the 
paine, for sometimes the very good warmth with good 
ligature auaileth much: fatty things must bee forborne in 
[^p.200^] 
some cases, namely when the paine is sharpe and quicke, 
least you cause putrifaction & suppuration of humours against 
[/64./] 
your will, yea and rather vse Acetosous medicines, 
and Anodine sometime, also musslage medicines are to be 
forborne, for like reasons: in all which cases, confer with 
other writers: aske counsell of thy Elders, and keepe euer 
in writing thy owne good obseruations from time to 
time. 
 
A word or two to conclude for the young Surgeons 
[/65./] 
concerning the cure of this disease, when they come vpon 
a coast where you may haue some helps, let them vse 
some one of these following, they shall find them good vpon 
triall. 
 
+R: Absinthiæ, Iuniper Berries of each m. j, Goats milke, 
lib. 4, boyle this together, the hearbs and berries well brused 
till a third part be consumed, then straine it, and adde 
of saffron in pouder +Q j, stirre it on the fire till it haue boyled 
a very little, and set it to cleer, and giue the sicke thereof 
three times a day at the least, viz. morning, noone, and 
night, this drinke hath cured many in great distresse: if you 
haue no goates milke, sheeps milke, or for a need, Cowes 
milke will serue. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
[/66./] 
+R. Water Cresses, Sorrell, and Wormewood, of each 
one handfull, bruise them well, and broyle them in three 
quarts of Whey or new milke, and adde thereto a little 
suger and saffron, and let the sicke drinke thereof as often 
as hee will. 
 
Whay drunken of it selfe is very good, but better if, the 
[/67./] 
iuices of scuruy grasse, sorrell, Coclaria, wormewood, 
Watercresses, the greater or lesser sort, Brooklime, Scordium, 
Spoonewort, water Iermander, or of some of them 
be mixed therewith, for that they are all approoued good 
medicines, and doubtlesse some of them are to be found in 
other Countries and coasts, as well as in England. 
 
[^p.201^] 
Also an infusion or gentle decoction of the roots of the 
hearbe Rhaphanæ siluestres, or horse-reddish in vineger, or 
mixed with beere and drunke, is exceeding good, or eaten 
of it selfe with bread. 
 
Bay berries, and Iuniper berries are also wholsome boyled 
[/68./] 
in whay against this disease, for they open obstructions: 
likewise from these former hearbs may many other 
good compound medicines be made. 
 
And generally note, that bitter and sower medicines 
preuaile most to the cure of this greefe, amongest which 
sower medicines you haue that are approued good thereto, 
[/69./] 
these that follow as cheefe, Iuice of Lemons, of Limes, 
Citrons, and Oringes. 
 
Oyle of Vitrioll, oyle of Sulphur, spirit of Salt, vineger 
of Wine, and the spirit thereof: also the Sirups thereof, so 
many as are in vse, and the rather, for that they cut away 
the tough and grosse flegme, and haue power also to open 
obstructions. In like manner, the iuice or pulpe of Tamarinds 
hath a great acetosity, and is found a precious remedy 
against this disease, the vse whereof is noted alreadie. 
 
Also: note further that there are few diseases at sea happening 
to Sea-men, but the Scuruy hath a part in them, 
[/70./] 
the fluxes which happen chiefly proceed from the Scuruy, 
and I suppose if Seamen may be preserued from that disease, 
few other diseases would indanger them. 
 
[}The conclusion.}] 
 
THese recited medicines for Christian charity I thought 
not amisse to publish, admonishing young men to be 
wise and carefull to make right vse of them, and as neere 
as they can, to respect in the vse thereof, Time, Place, Age, 
[/71./] 
quantity, quality, temperament, strength, climate, cause, 
and what else is fitting to be regarded for the good of the 
sicke, and credit of themselues, and let them auoide slothfulnes, 
auarice, enuy, feare, pride, or what else may hinder 
[^p.202^] 
these duties, that God may giue a blessing to their labours 
and then the praise and comfort shall returne to themselues, 
which God grant. 
 
And for the elder sort of graue Artists, I craue their charitable 
censures of my weake or vndigested instructions, 
which I no way meane to them, but to babes in Surgery, 
and so I conclude to the honour of the Almighty, concerning 
the Scuruy for this time. 
 
[}Concerning the Fluxes of 
the bellie.}] 
 
THe principall Fluxes of the belly by a common consent 
of diuers ancient writers, are chiefly referred to 
three kinds, namely: 
 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
Leienteria. 
Diarrhæa. 
Disenteria. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
[/72./] 
Leienteria is distinguished to be that Fluxe which either 
passeth the sustenance taken, wholy vndigested, and that 
without any bloud at all, and without great paine, or as 
it were halfe digested. The true causes of Leienteria proceede 
chiefly through imbecility and weakenesse of the 
stomake, which may be occasioned many waies, whereby 
[/73./] 
the vertue retentiue is weakened, yea and sometimes the 
stomake reseruing apostumation is either wholly weakened, 
[/74./] 
and cold and broken, or sometimes by crude humidities 
is oppressed, and must be strengthned, both inwardly 
and outwardly, by things that corroborate and warme 
the same, as is sirupe de absinthio, or oleum absinthis, Chimice 
[^p.203^] 
three or foure drops thereof in wine, or beere for 
neede, and I haue found it good to a strong body, at first, 
namely in the beginning of the disease to giue him a vomit 
of the infusion of stibium, or rather of Salvitrioli, ten 
[/75./] 
graines if it may be had, or of aquila vitæ foure graines, 
or of Cambogia twelue graines, and so the medicine hauing 
done working, let him presently sleepe fasting, if hee can; 
if not, giue him a little Cinamon-water, or a little sanguis 
[/76./] 
prunellorum, if you haue it, or a draught of good aligant, 
or conserue of sloes, or quinces; and shortly after, namely 
three houres, if he cannot take his rest, giue him three 
graines of Laudanum in a pill, and so appoint him to rest; 
[/77./] 
but if you conceiue, or feare the disease to proceed of apostumation 
in the stomake, then beware of giuing any 
vomit before perfect suppuration of the same, for it is 
deadly, but outwardly you may apply to the stomake a 
bag, with wormewood, mints, or sweete marioram, and 
[/78./] 
warme being sprinkled with rose water and vineger, or 
else a bisket bedued well with rose water and vineger, being 
steeped, must be applied to the stomake; or annoint 
the stomake with vnguentum pectorale, or with oyle of nutmegs 
made by expression: also Theriaca andromachi, or theriaca 
[/79./] 
Londini +Q +s is very good giuen him vpon the 
point of a knife, or Marmalad of Quinces is also good: 
[/80./] 
Methridate is very fit and approued, or grated Nutmegs 
is very good, and Cinamon in pouder taken in meats or 
drinkes is good likewise; if these things answer not thy desire, 
thou maist proceede to medicines more astringent, 
[/81./] 
such as follow in the cure of Disentery, one very familiar 
and good Medicine is sanguis prunellorum aforesaid, the 
dose is +o j or +o ij with Mint or Wormwood, or Carduus 
water, taken going to rest, or taken of it selfe. But your 
mentioned Laudanum in all Fluxes iudiciously administred 
is the only sure helpe, neuerthelesse in this griefe trie 
[/82./] 
other good things: first all Aromatized strong waters are 
conuenient in this case, moderately vsed as well to auoide 
further Fluxes, as also in these Fluxes to comfort the stomake, 
[^p.204^] 
stiptike wines serue well for it: likewise, Theriace diatesseron 
+Q j now and then, also electuariu~ diatrionpiperion +Q j 
[/83./] 
or +Q ij on a knifs point giuen is very good, for it mightily 
warmeth and strengthneth the stomake. But sometimes 
it happeneth that not onely the meate passeth away by 
stoole, but also other vndigested matter with it, in which 
case Petrus Bayrius in his Veni mecum folio 273, aduiseth 
to vse things sowre with meate as Veriuice, or the iuice of 
sowre Pomgranats and the like, in want whereof the iuice 
of Lemons is good, or rather sirupe of Lemons, or sirupe 
[/84./] 
de Agrestis, or oyle, or spirit of Vitriole taken in some fitting 
[/85./] 
drinke, as Carduus water, or faire water, wine, or Barly 
water, the oyle of Vitriole. 3. droppes taken with conserue 
of Roses is also good in this disease; outwardly keep 
warme the region of the stomake and liuer, and inwardly 
as is said, namely vse all good comfortable helpes that 
warme. 
 
[}Of Diarrhæa.}] 
 
DIarrhæa is a Flux of the belly which is either meerely 
watrish, or with humors and with slime mixed, for the 
signes of the disease are manifest, the causes too many for 
my leasure to note vnto you, concerning the cure of Diarrhæa 
if you see that the Patient be strong, there is no great 
[/86./] 
hast of stopping this disease, for that it is many times a benefit 
of Nature, whereby she auoideth superfluous, or venemous, 
or otherwise vicious and offensiue humours: but 
when you shall perceiue that it hath continued certaine 
daies, and that the party is weakned thereby, then begin 
[/87./] 
the cure as followeth: First giue him +q ij of Rubarb dried 
as they vse to drie Tobacco, and poudered either in wine 
or Carduus, or faire water, or the infusion thereof without 
the substance, and after the working thereof, a gentle glister 
will doe well, which may likewise leaue a stipticke 
quality in the guts, but not too strong, such as hereafter 
shall be mentioned, and let the party be laid to rest very 
[^p.205^] 
warme couered, and warme clothes applied to the belly 
[/88./] 
and fundament of the party, and if that helpeth, not you 
may giue him within three houres three or foure graines 
of Laudanum, and let him againe incline himselfe to rest 
and by Gods help he shall be cured: but if he haue a feuor 
giue him an opiate first, I meane the Laudanum. Good 
[/89./] 
helpes to the cure of this disease and all Fluxes of the belly, 
are these following, first to refraine and resist as much as 
is possible the motions of going to stoole, not to straine 
or force the body being at stoole, not to sit long being at 
stoole, in rising to remember to put vp the fundament 
with a clout, and that if it may be with a warme soft clout: 
[/90./] 
to sit as hot as the party can, namely if it may be often to 
sit vpon an oken bord hot is very good, hot trenchers, or 
peeces of bords heated and applied to the belly are very 
good, and to take the fume of wine vineger sprinkled on 
[/91./] 
a hot bricke, or iron, and sit ouer it on a close stoole is approued 
very good, and to sit ouer the fume of Franckencense 
[/92./] 
or Amber with a chafing dish, and a few cooles in 
a close stoole is likewise very good, this disease in our climate 
for the most part by skilfull Phisitions and Surgeons 
is well and speedily cured, but in the Indies it is very 
[/93./] 
hardly cured, in so much that many haue died of it, partly 
by the great wilfulnesse and disorder of the Patient, and 
by your leaue also by the ignorance of the Surgeon being 
a thing they had not beene warned of before, nor practised 
in, and by not hauing good remedies and instruments 
[/94./] 
fit at hand to giue men helpe, wherefore let young Artists 
haue a care to these afore mentioned rules and medicines, 
not scorning them.
