[}PROŒMIUM.}] 
 
ABove al things, I hold it most 
fitting, that Women (especially 
Midwives) should 
be well skil'd in the exact 
knowledg of the Anatomy 
of these Parts. Let it not 
be objected to me, That 
many good Midwives are ignorant of it; 
What then? The more is the pity, say I: 
[^p.2^] 
Must not I teach my Child a reason of 
what it saith, because a Parrot can speak as 
plain as it, without it? A Midwife is (or else 
should be) Natures helper, and how can 
any help Nature, and not be well skilled 
in the Tools by which Nature doth her 
work? this then is the business of this Book, 
viz. To give you a brief, yet very perfect 
Anatomy, of those members which Nature 
useth as instruments to beget its like, which 
being done, in all reason the manner of Natures 
forming the work, and fashioning the 
Child in the womb, is next to ensue, and 
shall (the Lord assisting me) in the next 
place be handled. 
 
The Instruments of Generation are two 
sorts, Male, and Fœmale, their use is the 
Procreation of Man-kind, the Operation is 
by Action, and Passion, the Agent is the Seed, 
the Patient, Blood; so that the Body of Man 
being composed by Action and Passion, 
he must needs, during his life, be subject 
to them both. 
 
To return to our purpose, that this may 
be made cleer, and honest women know 
what they have to do, I shall divide this 
Book into two Sections. 
 
[^p.3^] 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
Viz. 
	1. The Genitals of Men. 
	2. The Genitals of Women. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
[}Sect. 1. 
The Genitals of Men.}] 
 
FIRST, for the Genitals of Men (for I 
hope good Women will pardon me for 
serving mine own Sex first) some prepare 
matter to make seed of, and they are called 
Vasa Præparantia; some elaborate, or work 
this matter, as the Corpus Varicosum, some 
make the seed fruitful, as the Stones; some 
carry the seed back from the stones, and 
those are called Deferentia; some keep, or 
contain the seed so carried, as the Seminal 
Vessels, or the Prostates, some ejaculate or 
cast out this seed from those Vessels into 
the Womb, as the Yard. 
 
[^p.4^] 
I would willingly speak a word or two 
of each of these apart, but lest kind women 
(whom my intent is to please in this Treatise 
(if doing good to them wilplease them) 
should be offended, that I explain not those 
strange Names which the Rabbies of our, 
and former ages have used to muffle up our 
Eyes, lest we should see the Truth, and so 
break their yoke of bondage from off our 
Necks) lest (I say) they should be offended, 
I desire them to take notice, that they 
shall find them al explained in an Alphabetical 
order at the latter end of the Book; 
the iniquity of former times hath bin such, 
that I want fit English terms to express 
them, unless I should coyn them, and that 
I leave to be done by such as affect novelties; 
If I should every time mention their 
Outlandish words (part of which are Greek 
part Latin) stand to explain them, it would 
trouble the Readers patience much to read 
them, and Mine more to write them; 
therfore when you meet with them, search 
the Table at the latter end of the Book, 
and you may understand them. 
 
I would desire such Gentlemen as are 
skilled in Anatomies (of which I am afraid 
[^p.5^] 
there is but few) to pardon me in that I 
have not followed the vulgar rules of Anatomy, 
I desire you to know that I am 
not unskilled in most Anatomists that have 
written, and have been an Eye-witness in al 
I have written, my opinion is, that he is not 
very wise that altogether neglects Authors, 
but he is a Fool in grain that beleeves them 
before his own eyes. I commit my Writings 
to the tryal and censure of time as they 
have done before me, and shall with gladness 
imbrace that man that in the spirit of 
meekness (which is next of kin to the Spirit 
of God) tels me of my errors. Be diligent, 
be diligent, God and good Men hate idle 
Men and Women, and that you may be 
methodically diligent, be pleased to accept 
of this first Section, sub-divided into these 
ensuing Chapters, I hope you wil pardon 
me if I should be a little critical, or at least 
forbear your censure till you know and are 
able to prove I am in an error.

[}CHAP. 1. 
Of the Vasa Præparantia.}] 
 
[/1./] 
THese Galen cals [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
and the Latins Vasa 
Præparantia, the fittest term we in 
English can give them (for we must borrow 
terms of other Nations that we may make 
the common people beleeve wonders, that 
so our selves may grow rich and proud, and 
[^p.7^] 
keep folk in ignorance, though to their own 
undoing, and the loss of many a dear life) 
is preparing Vessels, which name 
is taken from their Office, Which 
[/2./] 
is to prepare that matter or substance 
which the stones convert into Seed, 
and fit it for that work; they are in number 
four, two Veins, and as many Arteries. 
 
And here by the way let me instruct you 
in one notion, (for I make no question but 
Physitians have kept you ignorant enough) 
the Liver is the original of blood, and destributes 
it throughout the Body by the Veins, 
its use is to nourish the Body, and repair 
decaying Flesh, and that you may conceive 
to be the reason why men which keep a very 
slender diet fall away in Flesh, because 
they want food to breed Bloud enough to 
nourish them: The Heart is the Original of 
the vital or quickning Spirit, which it destributes 
to the Body by the Arteries. I 
pray remember this all along, for you shall 
see some effects of it in the next Chapter. 
 
The Veins (as I told you) are 
[/3./] 
two, a right, and a left, the right 
proceedeth from the Vena Cava, 
[^p.8^] 
the left from the Emulgent Vein, 
although happily, through that ignorance 
[/4./] 
you have been trained up 
in, you know not what belongs to 
these Veins, neither is it my present task to 
teach you; yet hereby you may come to a 
sight of your ignorance, and that is the first 
step to knowledg; and I assure you, if you 
want love to knowledge, no more than I 
want will to teach you, you may (if God 
hinder not) have more by one half than you 
have, before you be two years elder. 
 
I confess the Learned make a grievous 
quoyl what the reason is, these two Veins 
should proceed from a different Root; I 
could quote them, and mine own Opinion 
two, and I suppose you partly beleeve it; 
but I forbear, it being my Opinion, That 
yong Naturalists, aswel as yong Christians, 
ought not to be led into doubtful disputations. 
 
Both Arteries arise from the great Arterie, 
which the Greeks call [^GREEK OMITTED^], which is 
indeed the great Trunk and Original of all 
the Arteries. 
 
[^p.9^] 
[}CHAP. 2. 
Of the Corpus Varicosum.}] 
 
YOu remember what I told you was the 
use of the Veins and Arteries, the preparing 
Veins and Arteries, the one carrying 
Blood, the other vital Spirit, all tending to 
the propagation of Man; all Four tend 
down directly to the Stones: 'Tis not my 
present scope to tel you which way: They 
serve as Laborers carry Bricks 
and Morter to Masons to build an 
house, to these carry Bloud and 
[/5./] 
vital Spirit to the Stones to make 
Seed, and now you know whereof 
Seed is made, but stay a little: Laborers 
temper their Mortar before they bring it to 
the Brick-Layers; neither is it fit the Stones 
should do all the work themselves, having 
four servants to attend them; therefore 
these four Vessels, though at their first descention 
they keep at a small distance the 
one from the other, yet before they enter 
[^p.10^] 
the Testicles or Stones (call them by which 
name you please) they make a most curious 
implication, intertexture, or twisting the 
one with the other, which the Greeks call 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], (if I be not mistaken, the word 
signifies a Kiss) Sometimes the Veins go 
into the Arteries; sometimes the Arteries 
into the Veins, then they separat again, the 
beholding of which brings an exceeding 
deal of delight to the eye, and content to 
the mind (I could shew it any man in the 
Anatomy of a Dog) this implication, weaving 
or twisting (as I called it before) is that 
which some Chyrurgions call, Pampiniformis; 
and some, Corpus Varicosum, which 
was the thing proponnded to be treated of 
in this Chapter. 
 
I do confess the same contexture of Veins 
and Arteries, though not in the same form 
may be found in other parts of the Body, 
as in the Arms and Legs; else a man being 
there wounded could not bleed to death; 
for unless the vital Spirit comes out aswel 
as the Bloud, he might but lose his nourishment 
for the time, he could not lose his 
life. But to proceed- 
 
[^p.11^] 
The Substance of this interweaving 
[/6./] 
of the Veins and Arteries 
is very hard, long, almost in 
[/7./] 
form of a Pyramide, without 
any sensible hollowness. 
 
Their Use is to mix exactly the 
[/8./] 
Blood and vital spirit, and of them 
both to make one Body, they begin also to 
change the colour of them from Red, to 
White, that so the Stones may have a fit 
matter to work upon, and the easier work 
to do, therefore this interweaving reacheth 
down even to the Testicles themselves, till 
it even pierce their Substance. 
 
[}CHAP. 3. 
Of the Testicles, or Stones.}] 
 
THe Stones are called in Latin, 
[/9./] 
Testes, that is, Witnesses, because 
they witnes one to be a Man; 
Ask the Pope else, he wil tel you I 
say true. The Greeks call them 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] because they are two. 
 
I need not tell you where they 
[/10./] 
[^p.12^] 
are placed, for every Boy that knows but 
his right hand from his left, knows that. 
 
Their Substance is white, soft, and 
[/11./] 
spongy, ful of smal Veins and Arteries, 
and that's the reason that 
when humors flow down into them 
they swel to such a bigness. 
 
Their Form is Ovel, but their bigness 
[/12./] 
is not alike, say Authors; he 
that hath a mind to know, 'tis but feeling; 
They say the left is the biggest, but the 
right is the hottest, which (say they) breeds 
the best and strongest Seed; and so they set 
Nature together by the ears with it self, as 
though the Stones could not agree in their 
own action. 
 
Each Stone hath a Muscle, which 
the Learned call Cremaster, from 
[/13./] 
the Greek word [^GREEK OMITTED^], which 
signifies to hold up, because they pull up 
the Stones in the act of Generation, that 
so the Vessels being slackned, may the better 
avoid the Seed: Age and sickness weaken 
these Muscles, and then the Stones hang 
down lower than they do in youth and 
health. 
 
[^p.13^] 
The use of the Stones is, 1. To 
[/14./] 
convert Bloud and Spirit into Seed 
for the procreation of Man, and yet by your 
leaves they convert not all the Bloud that 
comes to them into Seed, but keep some 
for their own nourishmentt. 2. They ad 
heat, strength, and courage to the Body, 
and that appears, because Eunuchs are neither 
so strong, hot, nor valiant as other 
Men: neither is an Ox so hot, nor valiant 
as a Bull. 
 
As for the Tunicles or Skins that cover 
and enwrap the Stones, they conducing nothing 
to our present scope, I willingly omitted 
them. 
 
[}CHAP. 4. 
Of the Vasa Deferentia.}] 
 
THE Vessels called Deferentia, are 
those which carry the Seed, being 
perfected and throughly concocted by the 
heat, and force of the Stones, from 
the Stones to the Seminary Vessels, 
[/15./] 
which are ordained to keep it, till 
[^p.14^] 
time serve for, or need require its expulsion. 
 
They are in number Two, and 
[/16./] 
no more, in colour white, in substance 
nervous, or sinewy, they 
have a certain obscure hollowness in them, 
and therefore Herophilus calls them [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
or the Spermatick Pores. 
 
They arise up from the Stones even up 
to the Belly, not far distant from the preparing 
vessels, when they are come 
into the cavity of the Belly, they 
[/17./] 
turn back again, and pass to the 
back side of the Bladder, between it and 
the right Gut, when they come neer 
the neck of the Bladder, they are joyned to 
the Seminal Cels, which are not much unlike 
the Cels of an Hony-comb; these Cels 
contain and Oyly substance, for they draw 
the fatty substance from the Seed, which 
they empty out into the passage of Urine, 
chiefly in the act of copulation; the supposed 
reason is, that the thin internal skin 
of the Yard be not offended with the acrimony 
or sharpness of the Seed, the Vasa 
Deferentia having passed, these fall into the 
Glandulæ Prostatæ, which are the Vessels 
[^p.15^] 
ordained to keep the Seed, to them now 
turn we. 
 
[}CHAP. 5. 
Of the Seminal Vessels.}] 
 
THe Prostatæ, or Glandulæ Seminales, 
are of such a Body as 
the vulgar when they find the like 
[/18./] 
in their meat, call Kernels. 
 
They are placed between the 
[/19./] 
neck of the Bladder and the right 
Gut. 
 
These compass about the Vasa Deferentia, 
and through the midst of these passeth the 
Urethra, or common passage both for 
Seed and Urine, you may if you please call 
it the Conduit of the Yard, I know not 
suddenly what fitter English word to give 
it; I am perswaded, and I have some hundreds 
of crabbed terms to witness it, that 
the Physitians have taken far more pains to 
lead men into ignorance, than I shall or can 
do to teach them knowledg, the ignorance 
of our forefathers made Physitians laugh 
[^p.16^] 
in their sleeves: but the end of all things 
hastens, and that knowledg is breaking out 
which shall so enlighten the world, that he 
who hath but half an eye may see their 
baseness without a pair of Spectacles: at 
the mouth of the Urethra, where it meets 
with the Vasa Deferentia, which is (as I 
told you) in the Seminal Vessels, is a Caruncle 
(there is another of their terms) in 
plain English a thick Skin, its Office is, that 
the Seminary Vessels being of a spongy nature, 
might not shed the Seed against their 
wills. This Skin which is very full of pores, 
the pores open through heat in the act of 
copulation, and so gives passage to the 
Seed, which being of a very subtil spirit, 
(and the subtiler for being moved) wil pass 
through as Quicksilver passeth through 
Leather, you can see no holes in the Leather 
by which it passeth, neither can you in 
this Skin, unless in the Anatomy of Man 
that had some violent running of the Reins 
when he died, then they are conspicuous; 
for indeed these Vessels are the proper seat 
of that disease: Besides many times by hanging 
of a Dog, his breast being swelled by 
retaining his breath, and his bowels being 
[^p.17^] 
compressed by swelling of that, hard dung 
sticking in the right Gut (which will alwaies 
be if you give him binding meat the 
day before you hang him) doth so compress 
these Vessels that you may plainly 
discern these passages or pores open. 
 
Many tims when children are cut for the 
Stone, in drawing away the Stone (which 
in my opinion is a likelier way to kill, than 
cure Children) I say, many times in drawing 
away the Stone, these Vessels are torn, 
and then if happily the patient happen to 
live, he may keep other mens Children if 
he please, but will never be able to get one 
of his own. 
 
Their substance is hard and spongy, of 
the bigness of a Walnut, or very 
neer, and their Use was taught you 
[/20./] 
in the former Chapter. 
 
[}CHAP. 6. 
Of the YARD.}] 
 
THe Latins have invented very many 
names for the Yard, I suppose done 
by venerious people (which Rome it seems 
[^p.18^] 
was full of then, since which time vices have 
encreased there faster than vertues) I intend 
not to spend time in rehersing the 
names, and as little about its form and scituation, 
which are both well known, it being 
the least part of my intent to tell people 
what they know, but teach them what they 
know not. 
 
[/21./] 
The Parts of it are partly common 
to it and the rest of the body, 
as, 1. the outward skin, which investeth 
the whol Body, the Eyes, 
Mouth, & c. excepted, as also the 
top of the Yard, and the Greeks call it 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], the Latins, Cuticula; and 
we in English, the outward Skin, or scarf 
Skin; it is very thin, as thin as the skin you 
pill off from the outside of a Codling, it is 
easily lost, and assoon grows again, and is 
altogether void of sence, you may easily 
thrust a needle through it and feel no pain; 
its use is to defend the other skin from dust 
smoke, or what else might offend it, or penetrate 
its subtil pores. 
 
2. The skin the Greeks call [^GREEK OMITTED^], the 
Latins Cutis, which is somewhat thick, and 
full of pores, through which the sweat, and 
[^p.19^] 
fuliginous vapors of the third concoction, 
(which concocts blood into flesh) pass out, 
these pores are very many, as thick as the 
holes in a Sief, but not so big, indeed they 
are as thick as they can be, and so smal that 
they are not visible to the eye, therefore 
Physitians cal sweating, and the passage of 
vapors through them, Insensible Transpiration, 
indeed they are far wider in some Men 
and Womens Bodies than they are in other 
some, and that's the reason some sweat more 
and easier than others do: I confess this 
skin is somewhat thinner upon the Yard, 
than it is upon some other parts of the Body; 
flaggy, when the Yard stands not, but 
stiff when it doth; this skin is very sensible, 
because the Nerves concur to make up its 
being. (And here I beseech you take notice 
of another grand truth, viz. That the 
Brain gives both sence and motion to the Body 
by the nerves, or sinnews (as the vulgar call 
them.) And yet Aristotle for all his great 
learning, was of opinion that the sence lay 
in the flesh, not in the skin; and Avicenna 
a notable Arabian Physitian, held it lay in 
the fat, which is more rediculous than the 
former. 
 
[^p.20^] 
3. The Carnea Membrana, or fleshy Skin 
(so called because it lies between the flesh, 
not because its body is fleshy) passeth in other 
parts of the Body underneath the fat 
and sticks close to the Muscles, but in the 
Yard there is no fat at all, only a few superficial 
Veins and Arteries pass between 
the former Skin and this, which when the 
Yard stands, are visible to the eye. 
 
These are the parts common both to the 
Yard, and also to the rest of the Body, 
which although I have been somewhat 
large about, yet I cannot account it tedious, 
because it conduceth to the teaching of 
knowledg to my Country Men and Women, 
who have been too long reigned in 
with the bridle of Ignorance by Physitians, 
that so they might the better be ridden by 
them; for just for all the world as the Popish 
Priests serve those they call the Laity, 
(which is but a word derived from the 
Greek word, [^GREEK OMITTED^], which is People in plain 
English, as though the Priests were no People, 
but either Angels, or (which is more 
probable, Monsters) as I say, the Popish 
Priests serve their Laity, so do our Physitians 
serve the commonalty of this nation; viz. 
[^p.21^] 
Hide all from them they can, for they 
know, (as well as I know I am alive) 
that should the vulgar but be a little acquainted 
with their mysteries, all their jugling 
and knavery would be seen, and their 
wealth and esteem which is the Diana they 
adore, would be put to a non-plus; and 
that's the reason when you hear any of 
them cry out against Me for writing Physick 
in my Mother Tongue, they bring no 
other Arguments than what the Papists 
bring for themselves in the same Point, neither 
have they wit enough to make 
any better: One holds the Word of God, 
the other Physick to be a mystery, and 
the vulgar must be ignorant in both, or else 
will they do themselves a mischief. 
 
[/22./] 
Those parts of the Yard which 
are peculiar to it self, and to noother 
part of the Body, are Six. 
1. Two Nervous Bodies. 
2. The Septum. 
3. The Urethra. 
4. The Glans. 
5. The Four Muscles. 
6. The Vessels. 
 
Of these in order. 
 
[^p.22^] 
The Two Bodies (for they are Two 
though joyned together) are long, hard, 
and sinewy, they are spongy within and ful 
of black Bloud; the spongie substance of 
the inward part of it, seems to be woven together 
like a Net, and consists of innumerable 
twigs of Veins and Arteries: The 
black bloud contained therein, is very full 
of spirits, and the Latins call it Pectiniformis; 
The Delights or Desire of Venus, ads 
heat to these, which causeth the Yard to 
stand; and that's the reason venerial sights 
and venerial tales will do it (it need be no 
stranger to any, that Venus (being a Planet 
cold and moist) should add heat to those 
parts, that the Moon (being colder and moister 
than she) should burn by night, as the 
Scripture witnesses, Psal. 121. 6. an Astrologer 
can give you a Natural reason of either) 
the hollow spongy intertexture or weaving 
was ordained purposly to hold or contain 
the spirit or venerial heat, so that the Yard 
may not fall before it hath done its work: 
You see what a rational piece the Lord 
made when he made Man. These two Lateral 
or side-Ligaments of the Yard, where 
they are thick and round, spring from the 
[^p.23^] 
lower part of the Share bone, and not from 
the upper part, as Galen dreamed, at their 
begining they are separated the one from 
the other, and resemble a pair of Horns, or 
the letter Y; where the Urethra or common 
channel of Urin and Seed passeth between 
them. 
 
2. They so soon as they come to the 
joyning of the Sharebone, are joyned by 
the Septum Lucidum, which is my second 
internal part to be described, it is in substance 
white and nervous, or sinewy, its office 
is to uphold the two lateral or side ligaments, 
and the Urethra. 
 
3. The Vrethra is the third of the internal 
parts of the Yard, and (for all Physicians 
have given it such a uncouth word) it is 
nothing els but the channel by which both 
Seed and Urin is conveighed out. 
 
It is in substance, sinewy, thick, soft, and 
loose, like to that of the side Ligaments before 
mentioned, it begins at the neck of the 
bladder, yet doth not spring from it, (for if 
you boyl the bladder, you may see it separate 
it self from it) but is only joyned to it, 
and so passeth to the Glans. 
 
In the begining of it are three holes, one 
[^p.24^] 
in the midst which is largest, which receives 
the Urin into it; the other two are smaller, 
which are sent from each Seminal Vessel to 
it, by which it receives the Seed. 
 
4. The Muscles of the Yard are four, 
two on each side: but before I treat of 
them, give me leave to tell you what a 
Muscle is, A Muscle is an Instrument of voluntary 
motion, without which no part of the 
Body can move it self, it consists of fibrous 
flesh to make up its Body, of Nerves, for 
its motion, of Veins for its nourishment, 
of Arteries for its vital heat, of a Membrana, 
or Skin to knit it together, and to distinguish 
one Muscle from another, and all of 
them from the Flesh; you may, if you 
look, easily distinguish them, in a Leg of 
Mutton, or any other meat where they are. 
But to proceed; the Yard (as I told you) 
is endewed with four of them, two on each 
side; It is not my present scope to shew 
whence they arise, only take notice, that 
the one of each side is shorter and thicker, 
and their use is to erect the Yard and 
make it stand, and are therefore called Erector, 
The other are longer and smaller, 
and their office is to dilate or open the lower 
[^p.25^] 
part of the Urethra, or Channel, both 
for the making water, and avoiding the 
Seed, and is therefore called Accelerator. 
 
5. The Glans is the extream part of the 
Yard, soft and of an exquisite feeling, by 
reason of the thinness of the skin wherwith 
'tis covered; it is also covered with the Præputium 
or fore-skin, which in some men 
cover the top end of the Yard quite close, in others 
it doth not, which moving up and 
down in the act of Copulation, brings pleasure 
both to the Man and Woman: The 
top of this is that which the Jews were commanded 
to cut off on the eighth day; The 
Ligament by which the Præputium or fore-skin 
is tied to the Glans, is called Frænum 
or the Bridle. 
 
6. The Vessels of the Yard are, Veins, 
Nerves, and Arteries. And yet Vessalius 
affirmed (though most falsly) that there 
was neither Vein nor Nerve in it. Some 
Veins and Arteries pass by the Skin, and (as 
I told you before) are visible to the eye; others 
pass by the inward part of the Yard, 
here the Arteries are wonderfully dispersed 
through the Body of the Yard, far exceeding 
the dispersion of the Veins, for the 
[^p.26^] 
right Artery is dispersed to the left side, and 
the left to the right side. 
 
It hath two Nerves, the lesser of which 
is bestowed upon the Skin, the greater upon 
the Muscles and body of the Yard. 
 
[}Sect. 2. 
Of the Genitals in Women.}] 
 
HAving served my own Sex, I shall 
see now if I can please the Women, 
who have no more cause than 
Men (that I know of) to be ashamed 
of what they have, and would be grieved 
(as they had cause, for they could not 
live) if they were without, but have cause, 
if they rightly consider of it, to thank me 
for telling them something they knew not 
before. 
 
I shall divide it into these Chapters. 
 
[^p.27^] 
Chap. 
Of the Privy passage. 1. 
Of the Womb. 2. 
Of the Stones. 3. 
Of the Spermatick Vessels. 4. 
 
[}CHAP. 1. 
Of the Privy passage.}] 
 
IN this I shal consider but these Seven following 
parts. 
 
1. The Lips, which are visible to the eye 
at first sight, they are framed of the common 
coverings of the body [/23./] 
& have pritty store of spongyfat, 
their use is to keep the 
internal parts from cold and 
dust. 
 
2. The Nymphæ or Wings, 
which appear when the Lips 
are severed, they are framed 
of soft and spongy Flesh, and the doubling 
of the skin, placed at the sides of the Neck; 
they compass the Clytoris, and in form and 
colour resemble the Comb of a Cock. 
 
[^p.28^] 
3. The Clytoris is a sinewy and hard bobody, 
ful of spongy and black matter within, 
as the side Ligaments of the Yard are, in 
form it represents the Yard of a man, and 
suffers erection and falling as that doth; 
this is that which causeth lust in Women, 
and gives delight in Copulation; for without 
this a Woman neither desires Copulation, 
or hath pleasure in it, or conceives by it. 
 
4. Under the Clytoris, and above the 
Neck, is the passage of the Womens Urin, 
so that the Urin of the Woman comes not 
through the Neck of the Womb, neither 
is the passage of the Urine common, as in 
Men, but particular and by it self, therefore 
in Injections for suppression of Urin in 
Women, or the like, you may, if you have 
not a care, easily err, by putting the Syringe 
into the Neck of the Womb instead of the 
passage of Urin. 
 
5. Neer this are four Caruncles or Fleshy 
Knobs, which because they resemble 
the form of Mirtle Berries, the Latins call 
them Myrtiformes; these are round in Virgins, 
but hang flagging when Virginity is 
lost, the uppermost of them is largest and 
forked, that so it may receive the neck of 
[^p.29^] 
the passage of Urine, the other are below 
this on the sides, they all keep back both 
air and other things from entring the neck 
of the Womb. 
 
6. In Virgins these Caruncles or Knobs 
are joyned together by a thin and sinewy 
Skin, or Membrana, interlaced with many 
small Veins, which hath a hole in the midst, 
through which the Menstrual Blood passeth, 
about the bigness of ones little finger, 
in such as are grown up, this is that noted 
Skin which is called Hymen, and is a certain 
note of Virginity where ever it is found, 
for the first act of Copulation breaks it. I 
confess much controversy hath been amongst 
Anatomists concerning this, some 
holding there is no such thing at all, others 
that it is, but it is very rare, the truth is, 
most Virgins have it, some hold all, I must 
suspend my own judgment till more yeers 
brings me more experience; yet this is certain, 
it may be broken without Copulation, 
as it may be gnawn asunder by defluxion of 
sharp humors, especially in yong Virgins, 
because it is thinnest in them, as also by unskilful 
applying Pessaries to provoke the 
Terms, and how many waies else God 
knows. 
 
[^p.30^] 
The Carunculæ, or fleshy Knobs together 
with this, resemble the form of Rose half 
blown, and therefore anciently called a 
Flower, and thence came the word [To deflower 
a Virgin.] 
 
7. The neck of the Womb, is nothing else 
but the distance between the privy passage 
and the Mouth of the Womb, into which 
the mans Yard goes in the act of Copulation, 
and in Women of a reasonable stature, 
it is eight Inches in length. 
 
Its substance is fleshy without; skinny, 
and exceeding wrinkled within. And it is 
so wrinkled, 
 
1. That it may better retain the Seed in 
the act of Copulation. 
 
2. That it may dilate and stretch, in the 
travail or bearing of Children, that the passage 
may be wider; the neck of the Womb 
is seated between the passage of Urine and 
the right Gut, to shew fond man what little 
reason he hath to be proud and domineer, 
being conceived betwen the places ordained 
to cast out Excrements, the very sinks 
of the Body, and in such a manner that his 
Mother was ashamed to tell him how. 
 
It hath two Membranæ, and if you cut 
[^p.31^] 
them you may perceive between them, a 
spongious flesh, such as is found in the side 
Ligaments of the Yard, which containeth 
spirits, and causeth it to swel in the act of 
Copulation, and furnished with innumerable 
sprigs of Veins and Arteries. 
 
[}CHAP. 2. 
Of the WOMB.}] 
 
GAlen and Hippocrates, and most of the 
Greeks call the Womb [^GREEK OMITTED^], and [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
and some [^GREEK OMITTED^]; and therefore 
[/24./] 
the usual word the Septuagint 
gives for [great with child is] [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
the Latins call it, Matrix, and Uterus; and 
we English, some follow the Latin word 
Matrix, but the only English word is, the 
Womb. 
 
Its parts are two, The Mouth of 
[/25./] 
the Womb, and the bottom of the 
Womb. 
 
1. The Mouth is a hole at the entrance 
into it, which may be both dilated and shut 
together like a Purse, for although in the 
act of Copulation it be big enough to receive 
[^p.32^] 
the Glans of the Yard, yet after conception 
it is so close shut that it will not admit 
the point of a Bodkin to enter; yet again 
at the Womans Delivery it is so open 
that it makes room enough for the Child 
to come out be it never so big: This was the 
matter of Galens admiration, and gives cause 
to every one of us to admire at the wonderful 
works of God in the Creation of 
Man; Who is there that knows himself, 
but may know there is an Al-poweful 
God? 
 
If the Matrix be inverted, hardned, ulcerated, 
have scars on it, or be too moist, 
there can be no Conception; for if it be 
inverted, it is not directly opposed to the 
Yard, then cannot the Seed be directly cast 
into it, then the Seed cools and by consequence 
becomes unfruitful; It it be hardened, 
it admits not the entrance of the Glans, 
or top of the Yard; If it be ulcerated it flies 
the very touch of the Yard; If it have a 
scar on it, there is no way for the Seed to 
enter in; If it be too moist it cannot retain 
the Seed when it is in; Of all these 
their Signs and cures in another Chapter. 
Only take notice that Hippocrates in his first 
[^p.33^] 
Book of the Diseases of Women affirms 
that the often use of the act of Copulation 
makes the Womb slippery and hinders conception. 
 
The Womb it self in Figure is almest 
[/26./] 
perfectly round, in Virgins it 
exceedeth not the bigness of a Walnut, yet 
when a Woman is conceived it dilates it 
self to that Capacity that it is able to contain 
the Child. 
 
It is smal, because the Seed is but little in 
quantity which it ought to imbrace and 
cherish. 
 
It is made up of two Skins, the 
[/27./] 
one internal, the other external; 
the external is thickest, and very smooth 
and slippery, if you except those parts 
where the spermatick Vessels enter into the 
Womb; the internal is full of holes. 
 
It differs much in form from the Matrix 
of Beasts, and that Galen was ignorant of, 
for indeed and in truth, Galen never saw a 
Man nor Woman dissected in his life time, 
it being accounted abominable in his time 
to use such supposed cruelty upon a dead 
Corps, and therefore he dissected only 
Apes, which was the cause he wrote such 
and Apish Anatomy. 
 
[^p.34^] 
It hath but one only cavity, and yet 
Mundinus his opinion was, That there were 
seven Cels in it; and he, and Galen, and other 
Anatomists (the later Writers that have 
written of Anatomies, yet never saw a Woman 
Anatomized in their lives, because 
they were famous men, were followed as 
little god-a-mighties that they cannot er) 
have so poysoned the world with this Doctrine, 
that most Midwives that I have talked 
with, hold indeed that the Womb hath 
seven Cels, each able to contain a Child apiece 
(forsooth) and so a Woman may have 
seven Children at one birth naturally, and 
no more; and this is just as true as the 
Moon is made of a Green Cheese. There 
is in truth but one only cavity in the Womb, 
and I cannot but admire why any that hath 
seen a Woman Anatomized should be of any 
other opinion, unless they should take 
the holes where the spermatick Vessels 
come into the Womb to be Cells. I shall 
(God willing) in my next Book speak more 
of the Conception of Twins in the Womb, 
and also how they are seperated. 
 
I shal here end with the Womb, for what 
else necessary concerning it is to be described, 
the next Book will manifest. 
 
[^p.35^] 
[}CHAP. 3. 
Of the STONES.}] 
 
THe Stones of Women (for they have 
such kind of toys aswel as Men) differ 
from the Stones of Men. 
 
1. In place; for they are within the Belly 
in Women, but without in Men. 
 
2. In quantity; for they are less in Women 
than in Men. 
 
3. In form; for they are uneven in Women, 
but smooth in Men. 
 
4. They are not stayed in Women by 
Muscles, but by Ligaments. 
 
5. They have no Prostates. 
 
6. They differ in figure; for they are 
depressed or flattish in Women, but oval in 
Men. 
 
7. They have but one skin, whereas Mens 
have four; and the reason is, because Mens 
are exposed to the cold, as being without 
the belly, so are not Womens. 
 
8. Their substance is more soft then in 
Men. 
 
[^p.36^] 
9. In temperature they are colder than 
Mens are. 
 
An thus much briefly for the Stones. 
 
[}CHAP. 4. 
Of the Seminal Vessels.}] 
 
THe Spermatick Vessels in Women also 
are divided into Præparantia, or Preparing 
Vessels; Deferentia, or Carrying Vessels. 
 
The Præparantia differ not in number 
from those in Men, for they also are Four, 
Two Veins, and Two Arteries; their rise 
or original is the same also as in Men; the 
right Vein springeth from the trunk of the 
Vena Cava, (what the Vena Cava is, you 
shalbe taught at the latter end of the Book, 
where al the hard Names shalbe explained; 
and that course hereafter will I keep in all 
my Writings) The right Vein (I say) springeth 
from the trunk of the Vena Cava under 
the Emulgent, but the left springeth 
from the Emulgent of the same side. 
 
Both Arteries spring from the great Artery, 
which the Greeks call [^GREEK OMITTED^]. 
 
[^p.37^] 
Yet there is some difference between the 
Preparing Vessels in Men, and those in Women; 
else I need not have troubled my self 
about them. 
 
1. They are shorter in Women than they 
are in Men, because their passage is shorter, 
the Stones of a Woman lying within the 
Belly, but of Men without, in lieu of which 
they have far more wreathings to and fro, 
in and out, than they have in Men, than so 
the Seed may be the better prepared; the 
often turnings to and from making amends 
for the shortness of the passage. 
 
2. They are not united (as they are in 
Man) before they come to the Stones, but 
are divided into two branches, whereof the 
greater only passeth to the Stones, the lesser 
to the Womb, for the nourishment both 
of it self, and the Infant in it. 
 
One quaint Observation let me Note, 
and then I have done with the Preparing 
Vessels, it is this: The Spermatick Veins 
receive the Arteries as they pass by the 
sides of the Womb, and so there is a mixture 
between the Vital and Natural Bloud, 
that so the work might be in the better 
wrought; for if you blow up the Spermatick 
[^p.38^] 
Vein with a Quill, you may perceive 
both the right and left sides of the Womb 
blown up, from whence may be easily apprehended 
the communion of al the vessels 
of the Womb. 
 
The Deferentia, or carrying vessels, 
[/28./] 
spring from the lower part of 
the Stones; They are in colour 
white, in substance sinewy, they pass not to 
the Womb streight, but wreathed, that so 
the shortness of the way may be recompenced 
by the multitude of the windings; near 
the Stones they are broad, after that narrower, 
near the Womb they become broad 
again. 
 
There proceed two parts from the Womb 
which resemble Horns, and are called, the 
Horns of the Womb; and they may be 
seen in female beasts as well as Women, 
though their Wombs differ far; in these 
Horns do these Vasa Deferentia end, and by 
them pass into the Womb. 
 
[^p.39^] 
AND thus much for my First 
Book, which contains the Anatomy 
of the parts dedicated 
to the Procreation of Man, or at 
least of so many of them as may serve 
for a Ground-work to the following 
Discourse; and this needs no guide, 
as being it self the guide and Basis 
to the whol Work. 
 
[^p.40^] 
[}BOOK II. 
Of the Formation of the Child 
in the Womb.}] 
 
[}PROŒMIUM.}] 
 
WHat the first sin of the Devils 
was, we neither know, nor was 
ever any able to tell us, it may 
be (did I say [it may be] nay 
out of question) 'tis well we 
know it not, for did we, as sure as a Club 
we should labor to do the like: But Adams 
sin we know was Pride, he would fain have 
been a little God-almighty, and his Wife a 
Goddess, and this he left hereditory to all 
[^p. not numbered^] 
[^An image of a full-grown fetus complete with the umbilical cord omitted.^] 
[^p. not numbered^] 
[^The page overleaf the image is empty.^] 
[^p.41^] 
his Posterity, so that the first sin that you 
can perceive a Child guilty of, is Pride, and 
this is so bred in the bone, that 'twill never 
out of the flesh. I would willingly have omitted 
here the proud conceits of the learned 
Rabbies of our Age, to wit, that no creature 
is rational but Man (as intending to 
write of it hereafter in another Treatise) 
whereas indeed there is no natural wisdom 
which Man hath found out by his long study, 
but the same is naturally to be found in 
the creatures taken in Sensu Conjuncto, nay 
and far excelling man, nay, the best of men 
breathing, when they have spent their time 
and tired their brains in study; it's possible 
a few Creatures (as Horses, and Oxen, and 
Asses, and the like) which Man hath 
brought up in slavery, may not be so rational 
as their Masters; a Bird that hath been 
brought up in a Cage will fly into the Cage 
again though you take him out and set him 
on the further side of a Table; but a Bird 
that was brought up in the Woods, and so 
knows what liberty is, if you shut him in a 
Cage he will go neer to die for madness. 
The reason is because the first knows not 
what liberty is, but by bondage is in a sort 
[^p.42^] 
deprived of reason. Did not the wisest of 
men say, Oppression will make a wise Man 
mad? And is Madness ought else but a deprivation 
of Reason? We cannot know 
whether Creatures at Liberty have any Religion 
or Knowledge of God or not, we may 
guess from Psal. 104. if we do but mark 
what we reade, that they have; however 
this is certain, they never went together by 
the ears about it as we have done, but as 
for an absolute Common-wealth, take it as 
a Free-State, or Monarchical, Man comes 
as far short of the wisdom of the Creatures 
as I do of the Wisdom of Solomon. 
 
1. Take such of the Creatures as hold a 
Free-State, and if Solomon may be beleeved 
such are Ants, some Countries call them 
Pismires, some Pisants, and some Emmits, 
The Ants have no King, yet go they forth in 
Bands; they have no King, therfore a Free-State; 
they go out in Bands, therefore have 
they Government. The word [Band] signifies 
Government, as well as Number, for 
Soldiers ungoverned will sooner make a 
Rout than a Regiment. Ants labor all for 
the publick good (as you may see if you do 
but observe them) and mind not private 
[^p.43^] 
interests. Oh that we could learn to do but 
so! 
 
2. Take another, Monarchical State, and 
they are Bees, reade but Butler his Book of 
Bees, written altogether from experience, 
and you shall see what an admirable Martial 
Common-wealth they keep, how patient 
in private wrongs, for if you abuse a Bee 
in the fields she will not sting you if she can 
possibly get away without, yet do but affront 
them at home then the wrong is publick, 
then if you would save your self you 
must run for it: The truth is, no Monarchy 
of men throughout the whol Universe was 
ever comparable to them, and yet they never 
read Ethicks, and are utterly unacquainted 
with Machiavelianism, whereas 
Man for al his Reason he brags so much of, 
and al his Reading and Learning could never 
frame such a Monarchy, but may, nay 
hath undone it self even by Civil Wars, 
(the worst of all other) witness the Græcian 
and Roman Monarchies, that I may not 
speak one word of England. 
 
The very truth is, Man hath far more pride 
than other Creatures, (the Lord keep me 
from such Reason) who having torn a little 
[^p.44^] 
knowledge from one Creature, and a little 
from another, and by comparing what one 
Creature doth with what another doth, having 
a few of them bred up in subjection 
and slavery, that they can have no commerce 
one with another, unless it be to pity 
one another in their slavery (for 'tis palpable 
that Birds and Beasts understand one 
anothers Language, though we understand 
but little of theirs, the Cucko excepted) so 
that for want of liberty they cannot come 
to the knowledg of their own state; And 
then Man vapors, That he is the only Rational 
Creature upon the Earth: Oh abominable 
pride! 
 
The consideration of this should humble 
Man; and it would do so too, if he would 
but seriously and without partiality consider, 
That God at first created him but a 
little lower than the Angels, and crowned 
him with Glory and Honor; but he by his 
pride and ambition, because he would become 
a little God, hath plunged himself 
into the depth of misery, that he is in a further 
degree lower than the Beasts; he was 
created lower than the Angels, for the 
curse of God for Adam's sin lies far heavier 
[^p.45^] 
upon man than it doth upon the rest of the 
Creatures, it is true, they are thereby made 
subject to vanity, but by constraint, not 
willingly, and therefore they groan for deliverance; 
but man is naturally so far from 
being sensible of the misery of that Original 
of all sin, that he vapors as though he knew 
wonders: When a man hath puzzled his 
brains all his life time in the study of Physick, 
he must die, and (if he be ingenuously 
honest) confess upon his death bed that his 
dog that lies in his chimney corner is a better 
Physitian than himself, and yet he never 
read Hippocrates. 
 
This may make even the Colledg of Physitians 
hear and fear, and do no more proudly, 
when their Worships may go even to 
the Beasts to learn, and take notice what 
the Spirit of God teacheth them and me. 
Job. 12. 7,. 8. Ask now the Beasts, and they 
shall teach thee, and the Fowls of the Air, and 
they shall instruct thee; Or speak to the Earth 
and it shall teach thee, and the Fishes of the Sea 
shall declare unto thee. Look upon it Colledg, 
look upon it, and when you do look 
upon it, do as the Peacock doth when he 
looks upon his Legs. 
 
[^p.46^] 
I was something the larger upon this 
Subject, because the knowledg of it is one 
means to move men to look up to Jesus 
Christ, and expect His Spirit, and to long 
after an Union with God through Him, 
when they do but see what miserable Creatures 
Sin hath made them: Besides, hereby 
a man may sooner com to the knowledg of 
himself, which is the greatest of all Earthly 
knowledges. 
 
I come now to the matter, which is, How 
proud, though miserable, Man is formed 
in theWomb. 
 
That this may be plainly and methodically 
handled, take notice, That the parts 
of a Child in the Womb, are: 
 
1. Partly Proper. 
2. Partly Common. 
 
These I shall divide into Two grand 
Sections. 
 
[^p.47^] 
[}Sect. 1. 
Of the Parts proper to the 
Child in the Womb.}] 
 
I Call those parts proper to the Child in 
the Womb only, which help either to 
nourish it there, or to cloath or defend 
it there; and are either cast away, 
or are of no use, it being born. 
 
These I shall divide into Two Chapters. 
 
1. The Umbilicares, or Navel-Vessels. 
2. The Secundine. 
 
The first serves for its internal use: The 
second for its external. The first nourisheth 
it; the second cloaths it, and defends 
it from wrongs. 
 
[^p.48^] 
[}CHAP. 1. 
Of the Umbilicares, or Navel-Vessels.}] 
 
THey are in number Four: One Vein, 
Two Arteries, and that vessel which is 
called Urachos; of all which apart. 
 
1. The Vein is the nourisher of the Infant 
even from the begining of the Conceiption, 
to the time of Delivery, till it breath 
the air, and concoct its food as we do. 
 
It ariseth from the Liver of the Child, 
and when it hath passed the Navel it is divided 
into two parts, and these two are again 
divided and subdivided, the branches 
being upheld by the Skin called Chorion, 
(of which more anon) and are joyned to 
the Veins of the Mothers Womb, from 
whence they have their blood, for the nourishment 
of the Child. 
 
2 The Arteries are two, one on each side, 
which proceed from the Iliack Branches of 
the great Artery of the Mother, by these is 
the vital blood carried to the child being 
ready concocted by the Mother. 
 
[^p.49^] 
3. A Nervous or Sinewy Production is 
led from the bottom of the Bladder of the 
Infant to the Navel, and this is called Urachos, 
and its use (as the word signifies, for 
we must use Greek words else how should 
we keep people in ignorance) is to convey 
the Urin of the Infant from the Bladder to 
the Allantois. 
 
I confess various are the opinions of Anatomists 
concerning this, some denying 
any such thing to be in the delivery of Women, 
but only in Beasts, some shew their ignorance, 
others their skill in the Art of disputation, 
and some few their experience, 
which I shall quote. 
 
Bartholomew Cabrolius, a Chyrurgian, 
and the ordinary Dissector of the Anatomies 
to the Colledg of Physitians at Mompeleer 
in France, records an History of a 
Maid, whose Water being a long time stopped 
did at last issue out through her Navel. 
 
Johannes Fernelius, Pathol. Chap. 13. 
records the like of a Man of thirty yeers of 
age, who having a stoppage in the neck of 
his Bladder, his Urin issued out at his Navel 
many months together, and that without 
[^p.50^] 
any prejudice at all to his health, which 
he ascribes to the ill tying of his Navel, 
whereby the Urachos was not wel dried. 
 
Velchier Coiter quotes such another, in a 
Maid of 34. yeers of age, at Norimberg in 
Germany; I confess these are but seldom, 
yet hereby may be proved such a thing as 
an Urachos in Men. 
 
These Four Vessels, to wit, one Vein, two 
Arteries, and the Urachos, do joyn neer to 
the Navel, and are united by a Skin which 
they have from the Chorion, and so become 
like a Gut or Rope, and are altogether 
void of sence, and this is that Women call 
the Navel-string. Women may if they 
please, when they have cut it off, take the 
pains to open it, and see for their own content, 
and those about them, that what I 
have written here is the truth. 
 
These Vessels are thus joyned together, 
that so they might neither be broken, being 
severed, nor entangled together; these when 
the Infant is born are of no use save only to 
make up the Ligament which stops the hole 
of the Navel. 
 
[^p.51^] 
[}CHAP. 2. 
Of the Secundine}] 
 
THe Greeks call this [^GREEK OMITTED^], and [^GREEK OMITTED^]; 
the Latins imitating them, call 
them Secundas, and Secundinas, and our 
Women, the Secundine, After-birth, and 
after-burden. 
 
They are in number held to be four, which 
here I shall only describe and shew their 
use, and let the forming of them alone till I 
come to the next Section. 
 
1. The first is that which is called Placenta, 
a kind of Latin word given to a Sugar 
Cake, because it resembles the form of 
such a Cake, it is knit both to the Navel, 
and to the Chorion, and makes up the greatest 
part of the Secundine, or After-birth. 
 
The flesh of it is like that of the Milt, or 
Spleen, soft, red, and tending something 
to blackness, and hath very many small 
Veins, and Arteries in it, and certainly the 
chief use of it is, for the firmer containing 
the Child in the Womb. 
 
2. Of the Chorion; this Columbus denies 
[^p.52^] 
to be a Skin, you see acute men may be 
mistaken; and if so, what an ill-favored 
Master TRADITION is, whereas it 
is most certain that the Chorion and Amnion 
involve the Child round, both above, beneath, 
and on both sides, the Allantois doth 
not so; the skin Hippocrates commonly in 
his Book of the diseases of Women, calls 
the Secundine, or at least give this particular 
name to the Secundine in general, 
(whereas Columbus mistook this for the Placenta) 
It is a skin thick and white, garnished 
with very many smal Veins and Arteries ending 
in the Placenta, very light and slippery. 
 
Its use is not only to cover the Child 
round about, but also to receive and safely 
bind up the Roots, and the Veins, and Arteries, 
or Navel-vessels before described. 
 
3. Of the Allantois; This some denies to 
be found in the Body of Man, and truly, 
those that prove it to be there, prove it 
more by Reason, than Experience: If I 
had so many Children in Holland, as I 
have had in England, I could have better 
certified you of the truth of it: Galen said 
there was such a thing in Women as well 
[^p.53^] 
as in Beasts, and the greatest part of our 
later Writers have been no better than Galen's 
Apes, and yet Galen never saw Man, 
nor Woman Anatomized; However, if it 
be, good Women may find it if they look 
for it, it is (they say) white, and soft, and 
exceeding thin, and just under the Placenta, 
where it's knit to the Urachos, from 
which it receives the Urin, and its office is 
to keep it separated from the Sweat, that 
the saltness of it may not offend the tender 
Skin of the Child. 
 
4. The last covering of the Child yet remains, 
which is called Amnios, it is white, 
soft, thin, and transparent, nourished by 
some very small Veins and Arteries. 
 
Its use is not only to enwrap the Child 
round, but also to retain the sweat of the 
Child, the use of which sweat, I shall happily 
touch upon hereafter. 
 
And thus much for the first Section, viz. 
The Parts proper to the Child.
