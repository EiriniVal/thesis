[}Cap. I. 
 
That this disease doth oftentimes giue occasion vnto simple 
and vnlearned people, to suspect possession, witchcraft, 
or some such like supernaturall cause.}] 
 
THE passiue condition of womankind 
is subiect vnto more 
diseases and of other [/1./] sortes 
and natures then men are: and 
especially in regarde of that 
part [/2./] from whence this disease 
which we speake of doth 
arise. For as it hath more varietie 
of [/3./] offices belonging vnto it then other 
partes of the bodie haue, and accordingly is supplied 
from other partes with whatsoeuer it hath 
need of for those vses: so it must needes thereby 
be subiect vnto mo infirmities then other parts are: 
both by reason of such as are bred in the part it selfe, 
and also by reason of such as are communicated vnto 
it from other parts, with which it hath correspondence. 
[^f.1v^] 
And as those offices in their proper 
kindes are more excellent then other; so the diseases 
whereby they are hurt or depraued, are more 
grieuous. But amongest all the diseases wherevnto 
that sex is obnoxious, there is none comparable 
vnto this which is called The Suffocation of the mother, 
either for varietie, or for strangenesse of accidents. 
For what soeuer straunge accident may appeare 
in any of the principall functions of mans bodie, 
either animall, vitall, or naturall, the same is 
to bee seene in this disease, by reason of the communitie 
[/4./] 
and consent which this part hath with the 
braine, heart, and liuer, the principall seates of 
these three functions; and the easie passage which 
it hath vnto them by the Vaines, Arteries, and 
Nerues. And whatsoeuer humor in other partes 
may cause extraordinarie affects, by reason of the 
abundance or corruption of it, this part will affoord 
the like in as plentifull a manner, and in as high a 
degree of corruption: and with this aduauntage 
that whereas in the other, some one or two of the, 
faculties onely one are hurt (as in Apoplexies, Epilepsyes, 
Syncopyes, subuersions of the stomacke, &c.) and 
not all (vnlesse as in Syncopyes by consent, where the 
vitall function ceasing, all the rest must needes 
cease) in this case all the faculties of the bodie doe 
suffer; not as one may do from another, but all directly 
from this one fountaine, in such sort as you 
shall often tymes perceyue in one and the same 
[/5./] 
person diuerse accidents of contrarie natures to 
concurre at once. 
[^f.2r^] 
And hereupon the Symptoms of this disease are 
sayd to be monstrous and terrible to beholde, and 
of such a varietie as they can hardly be comprehended 
within any method or boundes. Insomuch 
as they which are ignorant of the strange affects 
which naturall causes may produce, and of the manifold 
examples which our profession of Phisicke 
[/6./] 
doth minister in this kind, haue sought aboue the 
Moone for supernaturall causes: ascribing these 
accidents either to diabolicall possession, to witchcraft, 
or to the immediate finger of the Almightie. 
 
But it is no maruell though the common people 
and men also in other faculties verie excellent may 
bee deceyued by the rarenesse and straungenesse 
of these matters, which are hidden out of their Horizon 
amongest the deepest mysteries of our profession: 
[/7./] 
when as Phisitions themselues, as Cornelius 
Gemma testifieth. If they bee not verie wel exercised 
in the practise of their profession, are oftentimes 
deceyued, imagining such manifolde straunge accidents 
as their hee mencioneth to accompanie this 
disease, (as suffocation in the throate, croaking of 
Frogges, hissing of Snakes, crowing of Cockes, barking 
of Dogges, garring of Crowes, frenzies, convulsions, 
hickcockes, laughing, singing, weeping, 
crying, &c.) to proceede from some metaphysicall 
power, when in deede (as hee there sayeth) they are 
meerely naturall. 
 
Auicen also in his Chapter of this disease, speaking 
[/8./] 
of the causes of it, sayth, that there were some 
wise Phisitions in his time which said, that the cause 
[^f.2v^] 
of this disease was vnknowne: Because as Iacobus 
de Partibus expoundeth it, they did thinke it to be inflicted 
from aboue, yet notwithstanding he setteth 
downe naturall causes of it, and a naturall cure. 
 
Hippocrates also long before finding this error 
[/9./] 
to bee helde by some in his time maketh mention 
of diuerse of these Symptoms, and sayeth, that hee 
doth not see anie thing in them more supernaturall, 
or more to bee admired, then there is in Tertians, 
and Quartans, and other kindes of diseases: 
imputing it either vnto ignorance, and want of experience 
that Phisitians of his time did iudge otherwise; 
or vnto a worser humor, when as beeing 
loath to bewray their owne defects through pride 
and arrogancie: and not knowing what to prescribe 
[/10./] 
would flie vnto diuine causes, and neglecting naturall 
meanes for their reliefe, would wholy relie 
vpon expiations, incantations, sacrifices, &c. cloaking 
their ignoraunce vnder these shadows, and 
pretending both more knowledge, and more pietie 
then other men: by which course they gained this 
aduauntage, that if the patient chanced to recouer, 
they should bee highly renowmed for their skill; if 
not, their excuse was readie that Gods hande was 
against them. 
 
This hee speaketh of the Phisitions of his 
time, whome he confuteth principally by two reasons, 
which may serue for excellent rules for all 
men to discerne such cases by. The first is, that 
there is no supernaturall Character in these Symptoms, 
as hee proueth by an induction of diuerse of 
[^f.3r^] 
them, which in the co~mon opinion were thought 
to be aboue nature: yet hee proueth to haue their 
naturall causes in the bodie of man aswell as others 
haue. 
 
The strength of this argument will better appeare 
hereafter in the particular Symptoms, which 
we are to entreate of: where it shall be made manifest 
that the most of them doe both depende vpon 
such naturall causes as other diseases haue in our 
bodies, and also are oftentimes mixed with other 
diseases which are accompted naturall. 
 
It may likewise appeare by this, that whereas all 
other diseases are knowne by their notes and signes 
which resemble their cause (as Choller, Flegme, Melancholy, 
&c. haue their proper markes, corruption 
and putrefaction, their proper notes and malignity 
his Character) so there must be some Character or 
note of a supernaturall power in these cases (as [/11./] extraordinary 
strength or knowledge or suffering) or 
else we haue no cause but to thinke them naturall. 
If the diuell as an externall cause, may inflict a disease 
by stirring vp or kindling the humors of our 
bodies, and then depart without supplying continuall 
supernaturall power vnto it; [/12./] then the disease 
is but naturall, and will submit it selfe vnto Physicall 
cure. For externall causes when they are already remoted, 
giue no indication of any remedy. 
 
The second argument of this is, that these Symptoms 
do yeeld vnto natural causes, and are both procured 
[^f.3v^] 
and also eased by such ordinary meanes, as other 
diseases are: and [/13./] therefore they must needs be 
naturall. 
 
The strength of this argument is grounded vpon 
the very foundation of our profession which hath 
beene layd by [/14./] Hyppocrates and [/15./] Gallen long agoe 
and euer since confirmed by the practise and obseruations 
of all learned men; that diseases are cured 
by their contraries. I say contrary [/16./] both vnto the 
disease, vnto the cause, and vnto the Symptom. And 
the more exact the contrarietie is; the more proper 
is the remedy: as when they are equall in [/17./] degree 
or in power. But what equality of contrariety either 
in degree or in power, can there be betweene a 
supernaturall suffocating power, and the compression 
of the belly or throate. They are disperats in 
Logicke, but not contraries. For contrarietie is betweene 
such as are comprehended vnder one generall. 
And where one is opposed vnto one alone, 
and not indifferently vnto many. Neither doe I 
thinke, that any man wel aduised, will say that by 
compression of those parts, he is able to suppresse 
the power of the diuell. The like may be saide of 
the application of cupping glasses, of sweete plaisters, 
of ligatures, &c. beneath, and of euell smelles 
aboue; by all which we do obserue those kindes of 
fits to be mitigated: and yet there can bee no such 
contrary respect in the~ against a supernatural cause, 
as is between a remedy and a disease. They are also 
procured vpon sweete smelles, vpon pleasant meats 
and drinkes, vpon feare, anger, iealousie, &c. as in the 
[^f.4r^] 
particular causes shall bee farther declared: and yet 
no such consent can bee shewed in them with any 
supernaturall affect, as that they may any way cause 
or encrease it. Wherefore the rule of Hyppocrates 
must needes be true; that if these Symptoms do yeeld 
vnto naturall remedies, they must also bee naturall 
themselues. And thus much in explanation of 
these two arguments of Hyppocrates against the errour 
of his time: which notwithstanding hath been 
continued in the mindes of men vntill this day, and 
no maruell: vnlesse the same corruption which 
bred it at the first, had beene remoued out of the 
world. And therefore diuers of our Authors doe 
make especiall mention of this case wherein they 
[/18./] 
report the common people to haue beene deceiued 
by imagining witchcraft or possession, where indeed 
there was none. 
 
Amatus Lusitanus reporteth of one Diua Clara, a 
maide of 18. yeares of age, which had euery day 
two or three such strange fits, as those that were about 
her, gaue out that that she was haunted with 
an euill spirit. 
 
In those fits euery part of her body was distorted, 
she felt nothing, nor perceiued any thing: but 
had all her sences benummed, her hart beating, her 
teeth close shut together: yet for an houres space or 
two she would haue such strong motions, that shee 
would weary the strongest men that came at her. 
When she had beene three weekes in this case, her 
left arme began to be resolued with a palsie, &c. He 
being called vnto her prescribed such remedies as 
[^f.4v^] 
are vsuall in this case, and within few dayes recouered 
her, to the great admiration of the beholders. 
 
Petrus Forrestus maketh mention of another maid 
[/19./] 
of 22. yeares old, which dwelt with a Burgermaster 
of Delft in Holland, who falling in loue with a yong 
man, fell also into these fits of the Mother: which 
held her many houres together with such violent 
horrible accidents, as hee neuer sawe the like: her 
whole body being pulled to and fro with convulsiue 
motions, her belly sometimes lifted vp, and 
sometimes depressed, a roaring noise heard within 
her, with crying and howling, a distortion of her 
armes and handes: in somuch as those about her 
thought her to be possessed with a diuell, and out 
of all hope of recouery. He being called vnto her 
in Ianuarie 1565. applied conuenient remedies as 
there he setteth downe, and in a short time restored 
her to her health againe. 
 
Many more such like examples might bee produced 
[/20./] 
both out of authenticall writers in our profession 
and out of our own experiences, which yet 
do liue (were it not that late examples would bee 
offensiue to rehearse:) but these may suffice to show 
how easily men vnexperienced in those extraordinarie 
kindes of diseases, may mistake the causes of 
them: when through admiration of the vnwonted 
and grieuous accidents they behold, they are caried 
vnto Magicall and Metaphysicall speculations. But 
the learned Phisition who hath first beene trained 
vp in the study of Philosophy, and afterwards confirmed 
by the practise and experience of all manner 
[^f.5r^] 
of naturall diseases, is best able to discerne what is 
naturall, what not naturall, what preternaturall, and 
what supernaturall, the three first being properly 
subiect to his profession: and therefore they doe 
wrong vnto the faculty of Phisicke, and vnto them 
selues, and oftentimes vnto others, who neglecting 
that light which wee might yeeld them, doe runne 
headlong and blindefold into many errors and absurdities. 
For preuention whereof I haue breefly set 
downe what the doctrine of Phisitions is concerning 
[/21./] 
this disease of the Mother, which of all other 
is most subiect vnto misconstruction. For that as 
Forrestus saieth it is a harde matter to discerne in 
what maner the Mother may occasion such strange 
and manifold accidents. 
 
[}Cap. 2. 
 
What this disease is, and by what meanes it causeth such 
varietie of Symptoms.}] 
 
[/22./] 
THis disease is called by diuerse 
names amongst our Authors. Passio 
Hysterica, Suffocatio, Præfocatio, 
and Strangulatus vteri, Caducus 
matricis, &c. In English the Mother, 
or the Suffocation of the 
Mother, because most commonly 
[/23./] 
it takes them with choaking in the throat: and 
it is an affect of the Mother or wombe wherein the principal 
parts of the bodie by consent do suffer diuersly according 
[^f.5v^] 
to the diuersitie of the causes and diseases wherewith 
the matrix is offended. 
 
I call it an affect in a large signification to comprehend 
both morbum and Symptoma. For sometimes 
it is either of them, and somtimes both. For 
in regard the actions of expulsion or retention in 
the Mother are hurt. It may be called a Symptoma 
in actione læsa: in regard of the humor to be expelled 
which corrupteth and putrifieth to a venemous 
malignitie. It is likewise a Symptom in excremento 
vteri mutato. And in regard of the perfrigeration 
of the Mother, and so of the whole bodie. It is also a 
Symptom [/24./] in qualitate tangibili mutata, not morbus ex 
inte~perie: [/25./] because it is suddenly inflicted & suddenly 
remoued. But in regard of the rising of the Mother 
wherby it is somtimes drawn vpwards or sidewards 
aboue his natural seate, compressing the neighbour 
parts, & so consequently one another. It may be said 
to be morbus in situ, in respect of the compression it 
selfe, causing suffocatio~ and difficultie of breathing. 
It may be [/26./] causa morbi in forma by causing coarctation 
of the instruments of breathing. And sometimes 
these are complicated and [/27./] together with a 
venemous vapour, arising from this corrupt humor 
vnto diuers parts of the bodie, there will be an euill 
position of the matrix also: either because the ligaments, 
vaines and arteries beeing obstructed: [/28./] by 
those vapours are shortened of their wonted length, 
and so draw vp the part higher then it should be; or 
[/29./] for that the matrix being grieuously anoyed with 
the malignity of those vapours doth contract it selfe 
[^f.6r^] 
and rise vp by a locall motion towards the midrif. 
 
I say of the Mother or wombe because although 
the wombe many times in this disease doe suffer but 
secondarily, yet the other parts are not affected in this 
disease but from the Mother: (Radix suffocationum vterus) 
[/30./] 
which finding it selfe anoyed by some vnkind 
humor, either within it selfe, or in the vessels adioyning 
or belonging vnto it, doth by a naturall instinct 
which is ingrafted in euery part of the body for his 
owne preseruation, endeuour to expell that which 
is offensiue: in which conflict if either the passage 
be obstructed, or the humor inobedient or malignant, 
or the functions of the wombe any way depraued, 
the offence is communicated from thence 
vnto the rest of the body. The principall part of the 
body are the seates of the three faculties, which 
do gouerne the whole body. The braine of the animall, 
the hart of the vitall, the liuer of the naturall; 
although some other parts are plentifully endewed 
with some of these faculties, as the stomacke, entrailes, 
vaines, spleene, &c. with naturall faculties, 
[/31./] 
the instruments of respiration with animall and naturall. 
These parts are affected in this disease, and 
do suffer in their functions as they are diminished, 
depraued, or abolished, [/32./] according to the nature & 
plenty of the humor, and the temperament and 
scituation of the Mother: and that diuersly: For 
somtimes the instruments of respiration alone doe 
suffer, sometimes the heart alone, sometimes two or 
three faculties together, sometimes successiuely 
one after another, sometimes one part suffereth both 
[^f.6v^] 
[/33./] 
a resolution and a conuulsion in the same fit, or 
when as it suffereth in one part and not in another, 
[/34./] 
as we see oftentimes sence and motion to bee taken 
away and yet hearing and memorie to remaine, the 
[/35./] 
speech failing and respiration good. Sometimes respiration, 
sence, and motion do altogether faile, and 
yet the pulse remaine good: So that the varietie of 
those fits is exceeding great, wherein the principall 
parts of the body doe diuersly suffer. 
 
Another diuersitie there is, in the order of these 
[/36./] 
fits: for somtimes they keep due periods or circuits 
yearly or monthly, according to the falling sicknes, 
and sometime euery weeke, sometimes euery day, 
&c. I know a gentlewoma~ in this towne, who for 2. 
yeares together neuer missed a fit of the Mother in 
the afternoone. The like is hereafter mentioned in 
the Essex gentlewo. who for 16. years together had 
euery day a fit of the Mother at a certaine houre. D. 
Argent and I had another patient, in whome for 10. 
weeks together we obserued a fit of the mother euery 
saturday. I adde by consent of the Mother to distinguish 
those Symptoms or diseases from such as are 
caused originally by the part affected. For being procured 
but by consent, they endure no longer the~ the 
fits of the mother do continue. The consent or communitie 
which the matrix hath with those principal 
parts of the body is easily perceiued, if wee consider 
the anatomy of that part, & the diuers waies wherby 
it may and doth communicate with them. The fu~ctions 
of this part, besides that which is commo~ to all 
other for their nutriment deriued from the naturall 
[^f.7r^] 
facultie, are 2. the one respecting the preseruatio~ of 
the whole body, as it is an Emunctory of diuers superfluities 
[/37./] 
which do abound in that sex. The other for 
the propagation of mankind, where it is to be conceiued 
and nourished vntill it be able to appeare in 
the world. In regard of these offices this part hath 
neede of great varietie of prouision, according as 
the vses are manifold. The substance is neruous, for 
the great necessitie it hath of sence and motion. 
 
It is also Porous for the better entertaining of 
[/38./] 
the vitall spirits and the necessitie it hath of distention 
and contraction. 
 
It is tied vnto diuers partes of the body that it 
might the better beare the weight of an infant: 
backwards by little strings vnto the lower gut, vnto 
[/39./] 
the loines and os sacrum: forwardes vnto the necke 
of the bladder and os pubis by certaine membranes 
deriued from the peritoneum: on each side it is tyed 
vnto ossa illii by a ligament growing from the muscles 
of the loynes. It receiueth also for the former vses, 
vaines from the liuer, arteries from the hart, and 
nerues from the braine and backe, which are all inserted 
into the substance of the part, to deriue vnto 
it the benefit of those 3. faculties, both for the proper 
vse of the part, and for the vse of propagation 
and to discharge the whole bodie of diuers superfluities, 
which otherwise would be an occasion of many 
infirmities in them. 
 
Now according to this description let vs consider 
how by consent, the principall partes of the 
bodie may bee affected from the matrix. 
 
[^f.7v^] 
The partes of our bodie doe suffer by consent 
[/40./] two manner of wayes. The one is when they 
doe receyue some offensiue thing from another 
parte which is [/41./] called Communitas non absoluta. 
And this is either a qualitie as in venemous and infectious 
diseases, where the malignitie creeping 
from one part to another doth alter the qualitie of 
the parts as it goeth, and at the last is comminicated 
to the principall parts, as the head, heart, liuer, 
longs, &c. or a substance which either by manifest 
conducts, as vaines, nerues, arteries, &c. or by insensible 
pores (as Hyppocrates saith, our bodies are transpirable, 
[/42./] 
and transmeable) is conuaied from one 
part to another: whether it be a vapour or a humor, 
as wee doe commonly obserue in the fits of feuers, 
where a vapour arising from the part affected, disperseth 
it selfe through the whole body, and affecteth 
the sensiue parts with colde or heate, the motiue 
parts with trembling, the vitall parts with fainting, 
sounding, inequalitie of pulse, &c. the naturall 
parts with deiection of appetite, subuersion of the 
stomacke, &c. vntill nature haue ouercome and 
discussed it. In these Feuers also many times humors 
[/43./] 
are so plentifully sent vp vnto the braine, as 
by custome or long continuance they breede some 
proper affect there. 
 
The other kinde of communitie is that which 
they call Communitas absoluta, wherein the part consenting 
receiueth nothing from the other, but yet 
is partaker of his griefe: either for similitude of substance 
or function, which causeth mutuall compassion: 
[^f.8r^] 
as all neruous partes haue with the braine: 
whereby if any Nerue or neruous part bee hurt or 
pricked, the braine suffreth a convulsion, or for 
neighbourhood and vicinitie, whereby one part may 
offend another, by compression or incumbencie: 
as in the prolapse of the Mother, the bladder or fundament 
is oftentimes offended in their naturall excretion. 
And in this disease which we haue in hand 
by the locall motion of it vpwardes, the midriffe 
is straightned of his scope, whereby the lunges doe 
faile in their dutie, or by reason of connexion or continuitie 
which it hath with other parts, by Vaines, 
Nerues, Arteries, Membranes, Ligaments, &c. 
whereby the offence is easily imparted vnto other 
partes. Or lastly by priuation of some facultie or 
[/44./] 
matter, whereof the part hath neede. As in the obstruction 
of the Spina Dorsi there followeth a resolution 
or palsie of the legges or armes, by reason 
that the animall facultie that should giue sence or 
motion to the part is intercepted and hindered in 
his passage. Likewise in a resolution of the Muscles 
of the brest, as in a wound of that part, or in swounding 
the voice is taken away, because the matter of 
[/45./] 
it which is breath, is either not sufficiently made, or 
is carried another way, or not competently impelled 
to the organs of voyce. 
 
All these manner of wayes hath the Matrix by 
consent to impart her offence vnto other parts. For 
there wa~teth no corruption of humor, vapour, nor 
euill qualitie, where this part is ill affected, to infect 
other partes withall, there wantes no oportunitie 
[^f.8v^] 
of conueyance or passage vnto any part, by 
reason of the large Vaynes, Arteries, and Nerues, 
which are deriued vnto it, with which it hath great 
affinitie and similitude of substance, besides the 
connexion it hath with the heart, liuer, braine, and 
backe. It is linked also in neighborhoode with diuerse 
partes of great vse, as the bladder, guttes, midriffe, 
&c. which are likely to bee warmed when this 
part doth burne. According to the varietie of causes and 
diseases wherewith the wombe is offended, these Symptoms 
doe differ in nature, or in degree. [/46./] A plentifull 
matter produceth a vehement Symptom: a 
corrupt matter according to the degree of corruption, 
and the qualitie of the humor corrupted, causeth 
like accidents. The diseases also of the Mother 
being co~plicated with the former corrupt humors 
do yeeld varietie of Symptoms: as the rising of the 
Mother, which alwayes causeth shortnes of breath: 
Empostumes of the Mother according to the 
[/47./] 
place where they are bred, and the quality of them, 
doe also bring a difference in Symptoms. And thus 
much for explanation of the definition. 
 
[^f.9r^] 
[}Cap. 3. 
 
Of the kinds of this disease, and first of that wherein the 
vitall facultie is offended.}] 
 
NOw I come to the kinds and sorts 
of this disease, which may bee 
reduced vnto three principall 
heades, according as euerie part 
of the bodie belongeth vnto 
some of the three principall 
functions which do gouerne the 
bodie of man. Not that euerie Symptom in this disease 
[/48./] 
doth hurt some of the three functions, for some 
are onely molestations or deformities, as sudden 
Collickes, windie humors, noyses, alteration of colour, 
&c. But because euerie part may well bee mustred 
vnder some of these generals: and we doe seldome 
see any hystericall affect wherein some one 
or mo of the functions are not affected. These functions 
as they are distinct in office, so they possesse 
in our bodies seuerall seats and haue seuerall instruments 
belonging vnto them. 
 
The vitall function which by preseruing naturall 
heat in a due temperature, maintaineth the 
coniunction of soule and bodie togither, hath his 
principall mansion in the heart, and from thence by 
his Arteries conueyeth vitall spirites vnto euery 
member. So as without this wee could not liue: 
and therefore it is accounted the principallest function, 
[^f.9v^] 
because the rest receyue their being from this, 
and this fayling they must needes all cease. This 
function is performed by the motion of the heart, 
and Arteries, which in this affect of the Mother is 
drawne into consent as it is either diminished, abolished, 
or depraued. The deprauation of this motion 
is either when it is too fast and quick, or when 
it beates disorderly. The pulse in this disease is oftentimes 
too quicke, although it bee weake withall: 
but seeing it brings no great offence with it, the 
patient doth seldome complaine therof. The greater 
offence is when it beates disorderly, and keepes 
no equall nor orderly stroke, but either trembleth 
and daunceth in the motion, or else is violently impelled: 
insomuch as it doth not onely remoue 
ones hande being applied to some part where the 
Arteries are great and neare to the skinne) as lately 
[/49./] 
appeared in a noble Gentleman of this lande now 
dead) but as Fernelius testifieth, hath sometimes displaced 
[/50./] 
the ribbes, and sometimes broken them 
through the violent motion of the heart. 
 
This Symptom is called the palpitation or beating 
of the heart, or Arteries whereof Maximillian 
the Emperour died as Crato reporteth, and wherewith 
Charles the fift was oftentimes molested, as 
Vesalius writeth. It is chiefly to bee perceyued where 
the Arteries are great & neare the skin: as vnder the 
left ribbes towards the backe, and in the necke: as 
you may obserue in Maides that haue the greene 
sickenesse, by the shaking and quiuering of their 
ruffes, if they sit close to their neckes: where sometimes 
[^f.10r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.9.^] 
through the dilatation of the Arterie there 
ariseth a [/51./] tumour as bigge as ones fist. This Symptom 
is euerie where mentioned by our [/52./] Authours 
in this disease and our dayly experience confirmeth 
it. 
 
This motion of the heart and Arteries in this 
affect of the Mother is oftentimes diminished either 
in part or to sense totally. In part, where the 
pulse in this disease is weake, slow, obscure, intermittent, 
&c. and the whole bodie accordingly feeble 
and slow in euery action, for want of influence 
of vitall facultie from the heart. It is totally diminished 
in that Symptom which is called Syncope or 
swounding, the very image of death, where the 
pulse is [/53./] scarcely or not at all perceyued; the breath 
or respiration cleane gone: by reason that the heart 
wanting his motion, hath no neede of the helpe of 
the lungs to refresh it withall, all the faculties of the 
body fayling, it self lying like a dead corpse three or 
foure houres togither, and [/54./] sometimes two or three 
whole dayes without sense, motion, breath, heate, or 
any signe of life at all (like as wee see Snakes and other 
creatures to lie all the winter, as if they were 
dead, vnder the earth) insomuch as diuerse [/55./] errors 
haue beene committed in laying foorth such for 
dead, which haue afterwards beene found to haue 
life in them, and haue risen vp in their burials, 
whereupon there haue beene lawes enacted, as 
[/56./] Mercurialis reporteth, that no woman which was 
subiect to this disease should be buried vntil she had 
beene three dayes dead. Or as [/57./] Alexander Benedictus 
[^f.10v^] 
of Bolonia sayth 72. houres, which commeth to the 
same reckoning. [/58./] Petrus Bayrus setteth downe diuerse 
reasons why they should not be buried before 
three dayes bee ended, besides the experience of 
some (as hee saith) that haue beene found aliue in 
their graues after they had beene buried. I will refer 
the reader for the reasons to the author homself, 
and to [/59./] Forrestus in his obseruations. [/60./] Plinie maketh 
mention out of Heraclides, of a woman who for 
seuen dayes together lay for dead in a fit of the mother, 
and was restored againe to life: which (saieth 
[/61./] Marcellus Donatus) is not to be thought a fabulous 
tale, seeing it is not repugnant to the rules of Philosophie 
and Phisicke. And [/62./] Galen making mention 
of the verie same hystorie vnder the name of Apnæa, 
discourseth of the reasons of it. 
 
[/63./] Rabbi Moses an ancient Author in Physicke, reporteth 
also of a woman, that in the fitte of the mother, 
did lie six dayes without sense and motion, her 
Arteries being waxt hard, and she readie to be buried, 
and yet recouered. 
 
[/64./] Bottouus a late professor of Physicke in Padua, 
reporteth of a woman that beeing giuen ouer for 
dead in a fit of the Mother, was by such conclusions 
as he tried, discouered to be yet aliue, and recouered 
her former health againe by such remedies as 
he prescribed. 
 
[/65./] Forestus of Alkmar in north Holland, but lately 
dead, setteth downe the like example of another, 
that lay in that maner 24. houres, and was by him restored 
to health againe. 
 
[^f.11r^] 
The like also he citeth out of Leouellus, in that 
place, of one that lay with her eyes shut, and dumb 
a whole day, and by conuenient remedies was deliuered 
from her fit, and could rehearse all that was 
done about her in the time of her fit. But the most 
[/66./] 
pitifull example of all other in this kinde, is that 
which Ambrose Paræe reporteth of Vesalius a worthie 
Physition, & for anatomicall dissections much 
renowmed, who being called to the opening of 
a Gentlewoman in Spaine, which was thought to 
be dead through the violence of one of these fits, 
began to open her, and at the second cut of the 
knife she cried out, and stirred her limbes, shewing 
manifest signes of life to remaine. The beholders 
were exceedingly amazed at the sight, and blamed 
the Physition much for it: who though hee tooke 
her for dead, yet tooke he great apprehension of 
sorrow for that accident, that he estranged himselfe. 
After through griefe and remorse of conscience 
for his error, pretended (as others say) a pilgrimage 
for the absenting of himselfe, and therein died. Many 
more examples to this end could I produce out 
of Authenticall writers, and late experiences, if it 
were free for mee to mention them: but these may 
suffice to shew how wonderfully the vitall facultie 
is ouerthrowne in this disease, and withall respiration, 
sense, motion, and all the functions of the bodie 
by reason of this. 
 
[^f.11v^] 
[}Cap. 4. 
 
Of that kind of this disease wherein the animall facultie is 
offended.}] 
 
THe second kind of this disease 
is, where the animall facultie 
doth principally suffer; and it 
is that faculty whereby we do 
vnderstand, iudge, and remember 
things that are profitable 
or hurtfull vnto vs, whereby 
also we haue sence and do feele 
the qualities of things, and moue to and fro, & performe 
diuers other voluntary actions for the co~moditie 
of the bodie. For nature had made vs but base 
creatures, if she had giuen vs onely the vitall facultie 
barely to liue, and the naturall to grow, and to 
supply the expence that is daily made of naturall 
moisture: If she had not withall giuen vs knowledg 
and vnderstanding of such things as we are subiect 
vnto, and abilitie to moue our bodies at our pleasure, 
to apprehend that which is profitable & to shun 
that which is offensiue, &c. And therefore as a facultie 
making most for the dignitie and vse of man, 
it is placed principally in the braine; from whence 
it disperseth his beames of influence into euery part 
of the bodie, according to the seuerall vses and necessitie 
of each part. 
 
This animalll facultie hath this peculiar difference 
from the vitall and naturall faculties, that the functions 
[^f.12r^] 
of it are subiect vnto our wil, & may be inte~ded 
remitted, or peruerted at our pleasure, otherwise the~ 
in the other faculties. For no man can make his 
pulse to beate as he list, or alter the naturall functions 
at his will and pleasure. But these animall functions 
may be abused both by our owne will, and by 
the violence of some disease, and by both, as Galen 
testifieth, lib. 2. de Symptomatum causis cap. 12. That it 
may be abused by our owne will, he proueth also in 
[/67./] 
another place, where he bringeth an instance of a 
seruant (serui barbari) who killed himselfe to anger 
his maister by holding of his breath. S. Augustine 
[/68./] 
saith that he knew a man that could make himselfe 
to sweate when he list, by his imagnation only. Cornelius 
Gemma saith, that he knewe one that could 
weepe when he list: others that could make their 
bodies stiffe like an image, imitate the voyces of all 
kinde of creatures, raise a hickocke, and breake wind 
as often and in what maner they would. And S. 
[/69./] 
Augustine tels of one that would make a kinde of 
musicke that way. Adrian Turnebus saw a rogue 
that gayned much money by shewing this feate, we 
do also daily see that some can counterfait madnes, 
some drunkennesse, some the falling sicknesse, some 
palsies and trembling, some can play the fooles and 
supply the roomes of innocents, some can make 
noyses & speake in their bellies or throates, as those 
[/70./] 
which Hyppocrates calleth Eugastrimuthoi ventri loqui, 
such as was the holy maid of Kent, and Mildred of 
westwall, &c. And it is strange to see how young 
bodies will be bowed and writhed diuersly, as wee 
[^f.12v^] 
see in tumblers iuglers, and such like companions. 
Hereupon diuers haue counterfaited diseases as I 
once saw a poor fellow being arested for a smal debt 
cou~terfaited a fit of the falling sicknes, with strange 
and violent motions: whereby the creditor in 
compassion was moued to release him. Being released 
he was well againe, and vnto his friendes seemed 
to confesse the cousonage: others haue counterfaited 
possessions, either vpon meere deceit or 
inticed therto through the conceite of some disease 
wherewith they haue beene troubled. But for this 
point I referre you to the histories of Agnes Brigs, 
[/71./] 
Rachel Pinder, Martha Brossier, &c. Ren. Scot tels of 
one that being blind, deafe, and dumbe, could reade 
any canonicall Scripture, but no Apocripha: But 
was discouered by inserting a leafe of Apocrapha: 
among the canonicall. Another faining her selfe 
to be possessed with a diuell, would answere to any 
question made in English, but vnderstood no latine. 
Diuers such like examples might bee procured to 
shew how the animall functions may be abused by 
our owne will. But against our willes this faculty 
doth suffer by consent in the suffocation of the Mother 
diuersly according to the varietie of offices or 
functions which it performeth. 
 
The functions of it are three, the first is called Internall 
and principall sence which doth gouerne 
and direct all the rest by Imagination, Reason and Memory: 
which if it bee hurt either by imminution or 
deprauation or total abolishment, then the inferior 
functions doe necessarily participate with the offence. 
[^f.13r^] 
They are hurt by Imminution when a man 
doth not Conceiue, Iudge, or remember so well as hee 
[/72./] 
ought to doe, as in dulnesse or blockishnesse, as wee 
call it in vndiscretion, foolishnes or want of iudgement, 
in obliuion or forgetfulnes, &c. They are abolished 
either in those drowsie affects which wee call 
[/73./] 
Caros, Coma, veternus, Lethargus &c. or in those astonishing 
Symptoms wherein all the animall faculties 
are at once taken away, sometimes with a generall 
resolution or palsie, as in Apoplexies: sometimes 
[/74./] 
with a generall conuulsion, as in the falling sicknes: 
sometimes with a Stifnesse or congelation of the body, 
[/75./] 
wherein they lie like an image in the same forme 
they were taken. 
 
These internall sences are ouerthrowne either 
in part or in whole in this suffocatio~ of the mother: 
[/76./] 
and thereupon it is likened vnto these former diseases: 
and this kind is accounted by Auicen to be the 
most grieuous of all other, where the imagination 
and reason is hurt: and the other which holds them 
with conuulsions, contractions, &c. he accounts to 
bee the milder and the more vsuall. And therefore 
he saith that commonly they can remember 
what was done about them in their fit: vnlesse it be 
[/77./] 
of this most grieuous kinde. 
 
The Internall sence is depraued when a man 
doth imagine, iudge, or remember thinges that are 
not as if they were, or things that are, otherwise then 
they are indeed. Whether they do it in cogitation 
alone, or do expresse it by word or deede. As 
[^f.13v^] 
[/78./] 
we see in those fooles which wee call naturals, in 
mad men, in melancholike men, in those that are 
furious, in such as do dote, in such as are distracted 
through loue, feare, griefe, ioye, anger, hatred &c. 
In some of which they will laugh, crye, prattle, 
threaten, chide, or sing, &c. according to the disposition 
of the party or the cause of the affect. 
 
These functions are also depraued in too much 
wakefulnesse through the commotion of the animall 
[/79./] 
spirits, also in dreames, where somtimes besides 
the deprauation of the fantasie they wil walke, talke, 
laugh, crye, &c. And lastly in that disease whith is 
called [/80./] Saltus Sa=ti= viti, or Saltuosa dispositio membrorum 
wherein they will daunce, and leape, and cannot 
endure to be quiet. 
 
This deprauation of the internall sences, is so ordinary 
in the fits of the Mother, as Horatius Augenius 
Epistola. 6. seemes to make it of the essence of this 
disease, that the imagination is euer depraued in it. 
But [/81./] Hyppocrates, Galen, Auicen, and most of the best 
Authors in our profession do affirme that very often 
there happeneth an alienation of the minde in 
this disease, whereby sometimes they will waxe furious 
and raging depriued of their right iudgement 
and of rest. 
 
The second function of the animall facultie is 
the externall sensitiue function; which giueth to the 
eye the facultie of seeing, to the eare of hearing, to 
[^f.14r^] 
the tongue of tasting, to the nose of smelling and to 
[/82./] 
diuers parts of the bodie the power of feeling. 
 
This function in all these kindes is diminished, 
depraued, or cleane abolished, but especially in this 
disease of the mother, we do obserue the offence 
which is done to the feeling facultie, when the 
parts are benummed or do not feele at all, or when 
they feele [/83./] paine and offence, or when they feele 
things falsely and otherwise then they are. 
 
Concerning hearing, although [/84./] Hyppoc. Rhasis 
and diuers others doe obserue that sometimes it is 
hindred: yet it seemes to be in the former kinde 
where the internall facultie doe suffer. For Mercatus 
puts it as a difference from the falling sicknes, that 
in this suffocation of the matrix they doe commonly 
heare. The priuation of the other sences of seeing, 
tasting, smelling and feeling, are verie ordinarie 
in this disease, as you may obserue in the Histories 
following, and in these quotations. 
 
The third function is that which giues motion 
to the whole bodie. This motion serueth either 
for a voluntary vse onely, or for a naturall vse 
also. The motions for the voluntary vse are the 
free motions of the externall members of our bodies: 
[/85./] 
as to bowe the whole bodie and the head by 
meanes of the backe, to apprehend with the hand, to 
stand and goe with the feete and legges, to chewe 
with the iawes, to open & shut the lips & eyelids, to 
moue the eies, &c. This functio~ is diminished in that 
affect which we cal lassitudo, werines or vnweldines, 
[^f.14v^] 
wherein we are not able to moue so strongly and 
nimbly as we should. 
 
It is abolished, either by a resolution or palsie where 
[/86./] 
the sound part drawes the sickly part, that is the part 
resolued, & depending draws the muscles & nerues 
&c. or by a Spasmus or contractio~ of them [/87./] where the 
sick part drawes the sound part, that is, the muscle 
which is affected, drawes the member which is wel. 
 
A resolution or palsie is either generall of both 
sides of the bodie [/88./] exempting the head, or of one 
side called Hæmiplegia, or yet more particular of the 
hand, legge, finger, &c. called [/89./] parapligia. 
 
A Contraction or Spasmus is also of like sortes, 
sometimes the bodie is held vpright and cannot be 
bowed any way in that affect which is called Tetanos, 
sometimes it is bowed forwardes Emprostotonos 
sometimes backward Opistotonos, somtimes the back 
is crookt in some part of it, as in Gibbo, sometimes the 
iawes, lips, face, eyelids, &c. are contracted, wherby 
they make many strange faces and mouthes sometimes 
as though they laughed or wept, sometimes 
holding their mouthes open or awry, their eyes 
staring, &c. Sometimes the handes, armes, 
legges, fingers, toes, &c. are contracted, sometimes 
particular muscles in the sides, backe, armes, legs, 
&c. one or more at once, as in crampes. 
 
It is depraued where the motions are immoderate, 
peruerse, inordinate, or indece~t, as when they are vnquiet, 
& cannot abstaine fro~ motions and gestures, 
casting their armes and legges to and fro, vp and 
[^f.15r^] 
downe, dauncing, capring, vawting, fencing, and in 
[/90./] 
diuerse maners forming their motions. Also in Convulsions 
of the members, where they are shaken and 
pulled by inordinate motions, as wee see in the falling 
[/91./] 
sicknesse. Also in trembling, palpitation, rigor, 
where the teeth do chatter, horror where the haire 
standes vpright, stretching, yawning, gasping 
twinckling of the eyes, &c. These impediments 
and deprauations of motion are dayly obserued in 
vterne affects: as may appeare by these testimonies.

[^f.15v^] 
The animall motions which doe serue for naturall 
vse, haue their power from the animall facultie, 
but their vrging and prouoking and cause from 
the naturall, and are either Respiration, Ingestion, or 
[/92./] 
Excretion. Respiration hath annexed vnto it voyce, 
and speach, this is diminished or abolished in Suffocation 
or choaking, from whence this disease which 
we intreat of taketh his name, as from the most co~mon 
[/93./] 
Symptom which appeareth in it. In difficulty of 
breathing. In priuation of voyce and speach. 
 
It is depraued when it is done immoderately or 
inordinately, whether it be voluntarie, or inuoluntarie, 
as in shortnesse of breath, sighing, yawning, the hickock, 
[/94./] 
sneesing, coughing, belching, vomiting, making of 
noyses, blowing, and reaching, &c. 
 
Ingestion, or swallowing, is also hurt in this affect, 
when either they cannot swallow meate, or drinke 
at all, or with great difficultie. 
 
Excretion is also hurt in this case, by vomit, seege 
or vrine, &c. when either they cannot performe it 
being prouoked, or do it out of season, or mere then 
is conuenient. &c. 
 
These Symptoms also appeare in the Suffocation 
of the Mother. Hyppocrat. de nat. muliebri. Muta derepente

These motions as they belong to the animall facultie 
are principally hurt by Resolution, contraction, 
or convulsion, according as the simple motions are, 
and therefore we shall not need to stand any longer 
vppon them in this place: as they belong vnto the 
naturall facultie, and do receyue offence in that respect 
shall be declared hereafter in the third general 
faculty. In the mean time let vs produce some examples 
of this 2. kind of Suffocation, where the animall 
faculty doth principally suffer: for examples many 
times do perswade more then doctrine. Hollerius reporteth 
[/95./] 
that the gouernour of Roan in France had 
two daughters which were helde with these fits, 
in such sort as they would laugh an houre or two togither, 
and confessed that they could not refraine 
from laughing, although diuerse means to that end 
were vsed, both by entreaty, and by threates. He tels 
also of a gentlewoman de Rochpot, who being in 
these fits would raue, laugh, & weep, her eies being 
shut. Forestus maketh mention of one Alcida Theodorici 
[/96./] 
at Alkmare a yong lusty maid who was held 24. 
houres in a most grieuous fit of the mother, wherin 
she lay as if she had beene halfe dead, hearing what 
was said about her, but could not speake, nor enioy 
[^f.16v^] 
her other senses. Sometimes she would bee pulled 
as if she had the falling sickenesse, sometimes would 
lie still as if she were in an Apoplexie, sometimes she 
[/97./] 
would onely stirre her legges, the rest of her bodie 
being dull: and although she could not speake, yet 
she would crie and laugh by turnes, and then be sullen 
and dumpish, as if she were dead againe. 
 
[/98./] 
Alexander Benedictus veronensis testifieth, that 
he saw a woman in a fit of the Mother, that was besides 
her selfe, and would sometimes laugh & sometimes 
crie. Those that attended her, applied Partrige 
feathers vpon coales vnto her nostrilles, and by 
chance through want of care there fell a great coale 
out of the Chafingdish into her bosome, where it 
burnt her, and made a great blister, but she perceyued 
it not vntill the next day, and then complained 
of her breasts. My selfe had a patient in this Citie 
yet liuing and in good health (whome I will name 
vnto any whome it may concerne) that endured a 
violent fitte of the Mother a whole day together: 
wherein shee had many strong conuulsions, and 
sometimes did lie as if she had beene dead. Insomuch 
as the midwiues would haue giuen her ouer, 
and imputed ignorance vnto mee that I woulde 
attempt any thing for her recouerie. But her husband 
being perswaded by me to make triall of some 
meanes which I had prescribed for her, shee was 
within three or foure houres deliuered of a childe; 
yet knew not of it, vntill shee was throughly recouered 
of her fit, which was fourteene or fifteene 
houres after, and then she asked her husband what 
[^f.17r^] 
was become of her great bellie. I could rehearse two 
other such like examples within this citie, which 
happened not many moneths since. 
 
But we had of late a most rare example of this 
disease in an Essex Gentlewoman of good note, 
who being once frighted by squibs, fell into these 
fits of the Mother, which held her euery day, and 
whensoeuer else she did eate any comfortable meat, 
for the space of fifteene or sexteene yeares togither, 
with such violent conuulsions, as fiue or six strong 
men could scarce hold her downe. Sometimes her 
limbes would be contracted, sometimes perticular 
Muscles, which would cause swellings in diuerse 
parts of her bodie, sometimes she would be without 
all maner of sense. And being made beleeue by a 
stranger Physition that she was bewitched, her fits 
increased vpon her, and grew to bee stronger then 
before. 
 
Bartholomeus Montagnana reciteh vp 31. seuerall 
Symptoms of this disease which hee obserued in a 
Gentlewoman which was his patient. Conuulsions, 
swoundings, choaking in the throate, sadnesse and 
lamentation, coldnes ouer her whole bodie, dumbnesse, 
and yet could heare, drowsinesse, beating of 
the heart, trembling of the handes, contraction of 
the fingers, &c. 
 
It were in vaine to heape vp many examples to 
this purpose, seeing our daily experience doth yeeld 
vs sufficient store of proofe of the varietie of these 
Symptoms in the animall facultie. 
 
[^f.17v^] 
[}Cap. 5. 
 
Of that kind wherein the naturall facultie is offended.}] 
 
THe third kinde of this disease is, 
where the naturall facultie doth 
principally suffer. This facultie 
is of great necessitie for the maintenaunce 
of mankinde and according 
to the diuerse vses 
thereof is distinguished. For 
seeing that nature bringes vs not forth into the 
world perfect men, in that ripenesse and integritie, 
of all humaine actions which afterwards we attaine 
vnto, when wee come to full growth, it was 
meete to be prouided of such a facultie in our bodies 
as might encrease our stature, & strengthen the 
instruments of the whole body, for the better perfection 
of the actions thereof. And this is called facultas 
auctrix. Seeing also that wee are made of a 
fluxible moulde which wasteth and spendeth it 
selfe many wayes, whereby it standeth in neede of 
continuall refection and replie: Therefore it was 
meete to be furnished with such a facultie as might 
repaire the decay and expence of our substance, by 
yeelding continually apt matter for the nourishment 
of the bodie. And that is called facultas altrix. 
And thirdly seeing, not withstanding our bodies 
are continually nourished with the best food, 
yet they must once die as well as other inferiour 
[^f.18r^] 
creatures doe: therefore God hath indued vs as 
well as other creatures with the facultie of generation: 
whereby wee may bee able to make our 
kind to continue as long as the world shall endure. 
 
These three naturall faculties haue diuerse others 
attending vpon them, as the faculties of Attraction, 
Retention, Concoction, Expulsion, Alteration, 
Formation, &c. Which I will for breuitie sake ouerpasse 
with their bare mention, because the Symptoms 
[/99./] 
of these faculties are not so euident to the beholders 
eye, nor so straunge as those of the vitall 
and animall faculties are, yet that these are also hurt 
in the suffocation of the Mother, appeareth both 
by dayly obseruation, and by the authorities of all 
both auncient and late physitions who haue written 
of this disease. 
 
[/100./] 
And to this place may we referre those accidents 
often mentioned in this disease. [/101./] Gnawing in the 
stomacke, and paines in diuerse partes of the bodie, 
breaking of wind, vomiting, purging by siege, vrin, 
or other excretion, loathing of meate, thirst, extraordinarie 
hunger, swelling in the throat, swelling in 
the body, in the feet, obstructions in the vaines, co~sumptions, 
tumors, feuers, priuation of voice, palenesse 
of colour, rumbling and noice in the belly or 
[/102./] throat, like vnto frogs, snakes, or other creatures, 
or as if they woule speake as Hyppocrates reporteth 
of Polymarchus wife. 
 
And these are three principall kindes of this 
[^f.18v^] 
disease wherevnto most of the Symptoms which euer 
do appeare therein may be referred. 
 
[}Cap. 6. 
 
Of the causes of this disease.}] 
 
THe causes of this disease and 
of the Symptoms belonging 
therunto, haue euer bin found 
hard to be described particularly: 
and especially in a vulgar 
tongue, I hold it not meete to 
discourse to freely of such matters, 
and therefore I doe craue 
pardon if I do but slenderly ouerpasse some poynts 
which might be otherwise more largely stood vpon 
 
The causes of this disease are either internall, 
or externall. The internall causes may be any thing 
contained within the bodie, as spirit, blood, humors 
excrements, &c. whereby this part is apt to be offended, 
but principally they are referred vnto these 
two, [/103./] blood, and nature. 
 
Blood is that humor wherwith we are nourished: 
without which the infant in the mothers wombe 
could neither grow & increase in bignesse, nor yet 
liue: and therefore it was necessarie that those that 
were fit for generation, should be supplied with 
sufficient store of this humor, for the vse of this part 
wherin the infa~t is to be nourished, for which cause 
there are large vaines & arteries deriued vnto it for 
[^f.19r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.17.^] 
the conueyance of bloud thereunto, and there is 
greater prouision thereof made in womens bodies 
then in mens: least this part should bee forced to 
withdraw nourishment from other parts of the bodie, 
and so leaue them weake and consuming. 
 
But this prouision of nature is oftentimes defectiue: 
[/104./] 
as when it is cut off by violent causes, and 
the part left destitute of this familiar humor, which 
should serue both for the comfort of the infant, and 
of the part it selfe: which finding offence thereby 
doth communicate it vnto the other partes with 
which it hath affinitie according to Hyppocrates doctrine. 
I. Morborum muliebrium, and Aristotle, de generat. 
animal. cap. 11. vteri euacuati sursum ascendunt & 
[/105./] 
præfocationes faciunt. Cordæus giues vs an example 
of one who by chaunce cutting a vaine in her leg, 
whereupon she did bleede plentifully, fell into a fit 
of the Mother, and by moist and nourishing diet 
was recouered. The reason whereof Hyppocrates 
referreth to the ouerdrying of those parts through 
large euacuatiou of bloud, wherby the matrix doth 
labour by such motion as it hath to supply it selfe 
with moysture from other parts of the body: or as 
[/106./] 
Mercurialis doth enterpret it, doth impart by communitie 
(as is aforesaid) the offensiue qualitie vnto 
the braine, and by that meanes procures convulsions, 
&c. Gallen referreth it vnto the ouercooling 
of those parts which necessarily must follow a large 
[/107./] 
euacuation of bloud, which coldenesse being very 
offensiue vnto the nerues and neruous partes by 
consent and compassion offendeth, the braine also, 
[^f.19v^] 
and by that meanes may procure the former Symptoms. 
 
And as the want and scarsitie of bloud may procure 
[/108./] 
this griefe, so the abundance & excesse thereof 
doth more commonly cause it, where the patients 
do want those monethly euacuatio~s which should 
discharge their bodies of this superfluitie: as we see 
in strong and lustie maidens, who hauing ease and 
good fare inough, haue their vaines filled with plenty 
[/109./] 
of bloud, which wanting sufficient vent diste~deth 
them in bulck and thicknes, and so contracteth them 
in their length, whereby the matrix is drawne vpwards 
or sidewards, according as the repletion is, 
whereupon followeth a compression of the neighbour 
parts, as of the midrif which causeth shortnes 
of breath, by straightning the instruments of respiration 
of their due scope. 
 
But if this bloud wanting his proper vse doe 
degenerate into the nature of an excrement, then 
it offendeth in qualitie as well as in excesse, and 
being detayned in the bodie, causeth diuers kinds 
of Symptoms, according to the qualitie and degree 
of the distemperature thereof. 
 
This distempereture is either in manifest qualities, 
[/110./] 
of heate, colde, moisture, drines, according vnto 
[/111./] 
which it is said to be, Melancholicke, Flegmaticke, 
Choloricke, &c. producing Symptoms of the like nature, 
or in corruption and putrefactio~ of this bloud 
which breedeth diuers strange kinds of diste~peratures, 
[/112./] 
according to the diuersity of the humor putrefied, 
the degree of putrefaction or the condition 
[^f.20r^] 
of the cause or author thereof. 
 
The other substance which most commonly 
[/113./] 
is found culpable of this disease, is nature or sperma: 
which besides the suspition of superfluitie in some 
persons, may also receiue diuers sortes of alteration, 
and likewise of corruption, able to worke most 
strange and grieuous accidents in our bodies. For 
as it is a substance of greatest perfection & puritie so 
long as it retayneth his natiue integritie: So being 
depraued or corrupted, it passeth all the humors of 
our bodie, in venom and malignitie. For it must 
needs be a vehement and an impure cause that shal 
[/114./] 
corrupt so pure a substance, which would easily resist 
any weake assault: and a substance so pure and 
full of spirits as this is, must needes proue most malitious 
[/115./] 
vnto the bodie when it is corrupted. And 
therefore it is compared to the venom of a serpent, 
a Scorpion, a Torpido, a madde dogge, &c. which 
in a small quantitie is able to destroy or depraue all 
the faculties of our bodies at once. 
 
Galen comparing the corruption of these two 
together, affirmeth that although from the putrefaction 
of bloud, diuers most terrible accidents doe 
arise, yet they are not so deadly as those which 
[/116./] 
proceede from the corruption of nature; and proueth 
it by this obseruation that diuers women enioying 
the benefit of mariage, yet through the suppression 
of their ordinary euacuation falling into 
this disease, had their respiration and vitall faculties 
vntouched, although otherwise they were most 
grieuously affected. 
[^f.20v^] 
others also hauing those ordinarie matters in good 
sorte, yet being widdowes and taken with this grief 
haue felt decay in those faculties as well as in the 
rest. 
 
How these two substances by consent may affect 
the whole bodie according to their seuerall natures, 
hath beene shewed before: But one scruple 
remaineth here to be discussed, namely how this venemous 
matter may lurke so long in our bodies in 
silence not shewing it self but at certaine times only. 
 
Galen in the former place declareth this by the 
[/117./] 
example of a mad dogge, whose venom being receiued 
of us, although but by the foame of his mouth, 
will remaine sometimes sixe moneths within our 
bodies vndiscouered, and then hauing gotten more 
strength and ripenes vnto it selfe, and opportunitie 
of conuaying his euil quallity vnto the parts, breaketh 
[/118./] 
forth to open view by diminishing or peruerting 
the faculties of those parts. I had once a patient 
in Kent who feeding vpon a mad hogge which 
hee had killed for couetousnesse sake, found himselfe 
distempered therewith at the first, but within 
fiue or sixe moneths after grew suddenly to be starke 
madde, and before his death, being by Phisicke restored 
to some reasonable vnderstanding he confessed 
the eating of that hogge to haue beene the true 
cause of his disease. Diuers reasons may bee yeelded 
of this as well as of the fits of intermittent agues 
of Epilepsies, of sweating, &c. which oftentimes haue 
their due recourse by the yeare, moneth, weeke, day 
or houre, according to the nature of the humor: 
[^f.21r^] 
which being crude expecteth his concoction in our 
[/119./] 
bodies and giues no signe of his presence vntill such 
a proportion of it be digested and resolued into vapours, 
as for the offe~ce therof the part affected is not 
able to brooke and for the weakenesse of the expulsiue 
facultie not able to auoide out of the bodie: but 
filling the vaines, arteries, and the habit of the body, 
is communicated to the principall parts; diminishing 
or deprauing their functions so long, vntill that 
portion of vapours be discussed through naturall 
heate: and ceasing againe so long vntill by firmentation 
and concoction, another portion of the corrupt 
humor shall be digested. 
 
The vniformitie of this humor and of the 
heate of concoction causeth the vniformitie of fits. 
And this is the cause of the due periods or circuites 
which oftentimes are obserued in this disease, 
whereof wee haue spoken before: according also 
to the condition of the part affected, which seruing 
as an euacuatorie to the whole bodie, is accustomed 
to such kind of humors and therefore can endure 
them better then other parts can. And this is another 
cause why this humor giues no signe of his presence 
vntill it may communicate with the principall 
[/120./] 
partes: which are soone offended either with the 
plenty of those vapours, or with the malignity, or 
with the vnwonted and vnaccustomed approach of 
them.
