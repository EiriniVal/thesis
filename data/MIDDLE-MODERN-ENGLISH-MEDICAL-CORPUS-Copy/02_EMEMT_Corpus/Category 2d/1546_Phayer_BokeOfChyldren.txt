[^f.S1r^] 
[}The boke of 
chyldren,}] 
 
TO begyn a treatyse 
of the cure of chyldren, 
it shulde seme 
expedyent, that we 
shuld declare somewhat 
of the pryncyples 
as of the generacion, 
the beinge in 
the wombe, the tyme of procedynge, the 
maner of the byrth, the byndyng of the 
nauyll, settynge of the membres, lauatories, 
vnctions, swathinges, & entreatementes, 
with the circumstaunces of 
these and many other, which if I shuld 
reherce in particles, it wolde requyre 
both a longer tyme, and encrease into a 
greater volume. But forasmoch, as the 
moost of these thynges are verye tryte 
& manifest: some pertayning onely to y=e= 
office of a mydwyfe, other for the reuerence 
[^f.S1v^] 
of the matter not mete to be disclosed 
to euery vyle person: I entende 
in this boke to let them all passe, and to 
treate onely of the thynges necessarye, 
as to remoue the sycknesses, wherwith 
the tender babes are oftentymes afflycted, 
and desolate of remedye for somoche 
as manye do suppose that there 
is no cure to be ministred vnto them, by 
reaso~ of theyr weakenesse. And by that 
vayne opinion, yea rather by a foolyshe 
feare, they forsake manye that myght 
be well recouered, as it shall appeare 
by the grace of God hereafter, in thys 
lytle treatyse, when we come to declaration 
of the medicynes. In the meane 
season for confinitye of the matter, I 
entend to wryte somwhat of y=e= nource 
and of the mylke, wyth the qualities & 
complexions of y=e= same, for in that co~systeth 
the chefe poynt and summe, not 
onelye of the mayntenaunce of healthe, 
but also of the fourmyn or infectyng 
eyther of the wytte, or maners, as the 
Poet Uergill when he wolde descrybe 
[^f.S2r^] 
an vncurteys, churlysh, and a rude condishioned 
tyraunt, dydde attrybute the 
faute vnto the gyuer of the mylke, as 
in sayinge thus. 
Nec tibi diua parens, generis nec Dardanus 
author. 
Perfide, sed duris genuit te cautibus 
horrens Caucasus, hircancq~ admoru~t 
vbera tigres 
For that deuyne Poet being throughly 
expert in the priuities of nature, vnderstode 
ryght well how great an alteration 
euerye thynge taketh of the humoure, 
by the whych it hathe his alyme~t 
& nouryshyng in the youth: which 
thyng also was consydred and alleged 
of manye wyse Philosophers: Plato, 
Theophrastus, Xenophon, Aristotle, & 
Plinie, who dydde all ascrybe vnto the 
nourcement, as moche effect or more, as 
to the generacyon. 
And Phauorinus the Philosopher (as 
wryteth Aulus gelius) affirmeth that if 
lambes be nouryshed wyth the milke of 
goates, they shall haue course wolle, 
[^p.S2v^] 
lyke the heare yf gootes, and of kyddes 
in lyke maner sucke vpon shepe, y=e= heare 
of them shalbe softe lyke wolle. Wherby 
it doth appeare, that the mylke and 
nouryshyng hath a marueylous effecte 
in chaungyng the complexion, as we se 
lykewyse in herbes and in plantes, for 
let the seede or ympes by neuer so good 
and pure, yet yf they be put into an vnkynde 
earth, or watred with a noughty 
and vnholsome humour, eyther they 
come not vp at all, or els they wyll degenerate 
and turne out of theyr kynde, 
so that scarse it may appeare fro~ whe~ce 
they haue ben take~: accordi~g to y=e= verse, 
Pomaq~ degenerant, succos oblita 
priores. 
 
Wherfore as it is agreing to nature, 
so is it also necessary and comly for the 
owne mother to nource the owne child 
Whyche yf it maye be done, it shall be 
moost co~mendable and holsome, yf not 
ye must be well aduised in takyng of a 
nource, not of yll co~plexion & of worse 
maners: but suche as shall be sobre, honest 
[^f.S3r^] 
and chaste, well fourmed, amyable 
and chearefull, so that she maye accustome 
the infant vnto myrthe, no dronkarde, 
vycyous nor sluttyssh, for suche 
corrupteth the nature of the chylde. 
But an honest woman (suche as had a 
man chylde last afore, is best) not with 
in two monethes after her delyuerau~ce, 
nor approchynge nere vnto her tyme agayne. 
These thynges ought to be consydred 
of euery wyse person, that wyll 
set theyr chyldren out to nource. 
 
Moreouer, it is good to loke vpon 
the mylke, & to se whether it be thycke 
and grosse, or to moche thynne and watrye, 
blackysshe or blewe, or enclynyng 
to rednesse or yelowe, for all suche are 
vnnaturall and euyll. Lykewyse when 
ye taste it in youre mouthe, yf it be eyther 
bytter, salte, or soure, ye way well 
perceyue it is vnholsome 
 
That mylke is good that is whyte 
and sweete, and when ye droppe it on 
your nayle, and do moue youre fynger, 
neyther fleteth abrode at euery stering, 
[^f.S3v^] 
nor wyll hange faste vpon your nayle, 
when ye turne it downe ward, but that 
whyche is betwene bothe is best. 
 
Sometyme it chaunceth that the 
mylke wasteth, so that the nource can 
not haue sufficient to susteyne the child 
for y=e= whiche I wyl declare remedies leauinge 
out y=e= causes for breuitie of time. 
 
[}Remedyes appropriate to y=e= encreasyng 
of mylke in the brestes.}] 
PAsneppe rootes, & fenelle rootes, 
sodden in broth of chyckens, and 
afterward eaten wyth a lyttle 
fressh butter, maketh encrease of 
mylke within the brestes. 
 
[}An other.}] 
The pouder of earth wormes dryed 
and dronken in the brothe of a neates 
tonge, is a singuler experiment for the 
same intent. 
 
Also the broth of an olde cocke, wyth 
myntes, cynamome and maces. 
 
Ryce also sodden in cowes mylke, 
wyth the cromes of whyte breed, fenell 
seede in pouder, and a lytle sugre is excedyng 
[^f.S4r^] 
good. 
 
[}An other good medicyne 
for the same}] 
Take Cristall, and make it in fyne 
pouder, and myxe it wyth asmoche fenell 
seede and sugre, and vse to drynke 
it warme with a lytle wyne. 
 
[}A playster for the encrese of mylke.}] 
Take fenelle and hoorehounde, of 
euery one two handfulles, anys seede 
foure drammes, Saffron a scruple in 
poudre, swete butter thre ounces, seeth 
them in water, and make a playster to 
be layed vpon the nurces brestes. 
 
These thynges haue propertye to 
augment the mylke, dylle, anyse seede, 
fenelle, cristal, horehounde, fresh chese, 
honye, lettuse, beetes, myntes, carette 
rootes, parsneppes, the dugges or ydder 
of a cowe or a shepe, gootes mylke, 
blaunched almondes, ryce porryge, a 
cowes tounge dryed and made in pouder, 
poched egges, saffron, and the iuce 
of rosted veale dronken. 
 
Thus moche of the nource, and of 
[^f.S4v^] 
the mylke: nowe wyll I declare the infirmities 
of children. 
 
Althoughe (as affirmeth Plenie,) 
there be innumerable passions and diseases, 
whereunto the bodye of man is 
subiecte, and as well maye chaunce in 
the yonge as in the olde. Yet for mooste 
commonlye the tender age of chyldren 
is chefely vexed and greued with these 
diseases folowynge.

[^f.S5v^] 
[}Of apostemes of the 
brayne.}] 
 
IN the fylme that 
couereth the prayne 
chaunceth oftentymes 
apostemation 
and swellyng eyther 
of tomoche crying of 
the chylde, or by reason 
of the mylke emmoderatelye 
hote, or excesse of heate 
in the blood, or of colde fleume, and is 
knowen by these sygnes. 
Yf it be of hote matter, the heed of the 
chylde is vnnaturally swolle~, redde, & 
hote in the feelynge, if it come of colde 
matter, it is somwhat swollen, pale, 
and colde in the touchyng, but in bothe 
cases the chylde can not reste, & is euer 
lothe to haue hys heed touched, cryeth 
and vexeth it selfe, as it were in a frenesye. 
 
[}Remedye.}] 
Make a bath of mallowes, camomylle, 
and lyllyes sodden wyth a shepes 
[^f.S6r^] 
heed, tyll the bones fall, and with 
a sponge or soft cloutes, al to bathe the 
heed of the chylde in a colde aposteme, 
wyth the brothe hote as maye be suffered, 
but in a hote matter wete y~ brothe 
luke warme, or in the coolynge, and after 
the bath, set on a playstre, thus. 
 
[}A playstre}] 
Take fenugreke, camomyll, worm 
wood, of euery one an handfull, seethe 
them in a close vessell, tyll the thyrde 
part be consumed, then stampe them in 
a mortar, and styrre them, to the which 
ye shall put of the same brothe agayne 
ynough to make a playstre, with a lytle 
beane floure, yolkes of egges and saffron, 
addyng to the~ fresh butter or duckes 
grese suffycient, and applye it. In 
a colde matter lette it lye a day: but in a 
hote cause ye must remoue of euery syxe 
houres. 
 
[}Of swellyng of 
the heed.}] 
 
[^f.S6v^] 
TNflation or swellynge 
of the heed co~meth of a 
wyndye matter, gathered 
betwene the skynne 
and the flesh, and sometyme 
betwene the fleshe 
and the boones of the 
sculle, the tokens wherof are manifest 
ynough to the syght, by the swellynge 
or puffing vp, and pressed with the fynger, 
there remayneth a prynte, whyche 
is a sygne of wynde and viscous humours, 
ye shall heale it thus. 
 
[}Remedye.}] 
Fyrst let the nourse aouyde al thinges 
that engendre wynde, salt or slymy 
humour_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], as beanes, peason, eles, sammon, 
saltfysshe, and lyke, then make a 
playster, to the chyldes heed, after this 
fashion. 
 
Take an handefull of fenell, smallache 
and dylle, and seethe them in water 
in a close vessell, afterwarde stampe 
them, and wyth a lytle cumyne, and 
oyle of bytter almondes, make it vppe, 
[^f.S7r^] 
and laye it often to the chyldes heed, 
warme. In default of oyle of almons 
take gosegrese, adding a litle vynegre. 
 
And it is good to bathe the place 
with a softe cloute, or a sponge in the 
broth of these herbes, Rue, tyme, maiorym, 
hysope, fenelle, dylle, comyne, 
sal nitre, myntes, radysh rotes, rocket, 
or some of them, euer takynge heede, 
that there droppe no portion of the medicines 
i~ y=e= babes eies, mouthe, or eares 
 
[}Scalles of the head.}] 
THe heades of chyldren are oftentimes 
vlcered, & scalled, aswell 
when they sucke, & then moste 
commonlye by reason of sharpe mylke, 
as also when they haue bene weaned, 
and can go aloone. Sometymes it happeneth 
of an euyll complexion of humours 
by eatynge of rawe frute, or other 
euyll meates, and sometyme by 
longe continuynge in the sonne, manye 
tymes by droppynge of restye bacon, or 
of salte beefe on theyr bare heedes. 
[^f.S7v^] 
Other whyles they be so borne oute of 
theyr mothers wombe, and in all these 
is no greate dyfficultie tyl the heere be 
growen: but after that, they requyre a 
greater cure, and a conning hande, notwythstandynge 
as God shall gyue me 
grace, here shal be sayde remedyes for 
the cure of them, suche as haue ben oftentymes 
approued: wherein I haue 
entended to omytte the disputations of 
the dyfference of scalles, and the humours 
wherof they do proceade, and 
wyll go strayght to the composition of 
medicynes, folowynge the good experyence, 
here ensuynge. 
 
[}Remedyes for scalles.}] 
Yf ye se the scalles lyke the shelles 
of oysters, blacke and drye, cleauynge 
vpon the skynne, one within an other, 
ye maye make a fomentation of hoote 
and moyste herbes, as fenugreke, holyhocke, 
beares breache, lyneseede, and 
suche other, sodden al or some of them 
in the brothe of netes feete, and so to 
bathe the sores, and after that applye 
[^f.S8r^] 
a softe playstre of the same herbes, w~ 
gosegrese or butter, vsynge this styll, 
tyll ye se the scabbe remoued, and then 
wasshe it with the iuce of horehounde, 
smallache and betony, sodden togyther 
in wyne, and after the wasshynge put 
vpon it pouder of myrre, aloes and fra~kensence, 
or holde his heed ouer a chafyng 
disshe of coles, wherin ye shall put 
frankensence and saunders in pouder. 
But yf ye se the scabbes be verye sore 
and mattrye wyth great payne, & burnynge 
of the heed, Ye shall make un 
oyntment to coole the matter thus. 
 
[}An oyntment to coole the burnynge 
of a sore heade.}] 
Take whyte leade and lytarge, of euerye 
one .v. drammes, lye made of the 
asshes of a vyne .iii. drammes, oyle of 
roses, an ounce, wax_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], an ounce, melte 
the waxe fyrst, than putte to the oyle & 
lye, wyth the reste, and in the ende .ii. 
yolkes of egges, make an oyntmente, & 
laye it to the head. This is the composition 
of Rasis. 
 
[^f.S8v^] 
[}An other oyntment singuler 
for the same pourpose.}] 
Take betonye, grounswel, plantayn 
fumytorie, and dayses, of euerye one, 
lyke moche, stampe them, and myngle 
them wyth a pounde of fresshe swynes 
grece, and lette them stande closed in a 
moyst place .viii. dayes, to putrify, tha~ 
frye them in a panne, and strayne them 
into a cleane vessell and ye shall haue a 
grene oyntme~te of a singuler operatio~ 
for the sayde dysease, and to quenche 
all vnkind heates of the bodye. 
 
Also ye muste vse to shaue the head, 
what so euer thi~ges ye doo laye vnto it 
If there laketh the cleansyng of the sores, 
and the chylde weaned, ye shall do 
wel to make an oyntment of a lytle turpentyne, 
bulles gall, and hony and lay 
vpon the sores. 
 
Also it is proued, that the vryne of a 
bulle, is a singuler remedy to mundifie 
the sores, and to lose the heares by the 
rootes, wythout any peyne or pille. 
 
The iuyce also of morell, daysie leanes 
[^f.T1r^] 
and groundswell fryed wyth grece 
and made in an oyntmente, cooleth all 
vnkynde heates, and pustles, of the 
heade. 
 
Here is to be noted, that durynge 
thys dysease in a suckynge chylde, the 
nourse muste auoyde all salte, and sower 
meates that engender cholere, as 
mustarde, vynegre, and suche, and all 
maner frutes, (excepte a pomegranat) 
and she must abstayne in this case, both 
from egges, and frome other kynde of 
whyte meates in general, and aboue all 
she maye eate no dates, figges, nor purcelane, 
for manye holde opynion, that 
purcelane hath an euylle propertye to 
breede scabbes and vlcers in the head. 
Moreouer the childes head may not be 
kepte to hote, for that is oftentymes, 
the cause of thys dysease 
 
Sometymes it chaunceth that there 
breadeth in the heade of chyldren as it 
were litle wartes or knobbes somwhat 
harde, and can not be resolued by the 
sayde medicines. Wherefore when ye 
[^f.T1v^] 
se that none other thynge wyll healpe, 
ye shal make a good oyntemente to remoue 
it, in maner as hereafter is declared. 
 
[}An excellent remedye for 
wartes or knobbes 
of the head.}] 
Take lytarge & whyte lead, of eche 
a like quantitie, brymstome and quycke 
syluer quenched wyth spyttle of eche a 
lesse quantitie, twyse asmoch oyle of roses, 
and a sponefulle or .ii. of vynegre, 
mixe them all togyther, on a marble, til 
they be an oyntment, and laye it on the 
head, & whan it hath ben drye an houre 
or .ii. wasshe it of. with water, wherein 
was sodden maiorym, sauery and mintes, 
vse it thus twyse a day, mornynge 
and euenynge tylle ye se it hole. This 
thyng is also good in al the other kind 
of scalles. 
 
[}Of watchyng out of measure.}] 
SLepe is the nouryshment and foode 
of a suckyng chylde, and asmuch requisyte 
as the very tete, wherfore wha~ 
[^f.T2r^] 
it is depryued of the naturalle reste, all 
the hole bodye falleth in distemper, cruditie 
and wekenes, it procedeth commonly 
by corruption of the milke, or 
to moche abundaunce whyche ouerladeth 
y=e= stomacke, and for lacke of good 
dygestion, vapoures and fumes aryse 
into the head, and infecte the brayne, by 
reason wherof the chyld can not slepe, 
but turneth and vexeth it selfe wyth 
cryeng. Therfore it shal be good to prouoke 
it to a naturall sleepe thus, accordyng 
to Rasis. 
 
Annoynte the forehead and temples 
of the chylde, wyth oyle of vyolettes 
and vynegre, puttyng a droppe or 
.ii. into the nosethrylles, and yf ye can 
get anye syrupe of poppye, gyue it the 
chylde to lycke, and than make a playstre 
of oyle of saffron, lettuse, and 
the iuyce of poppie, or wet cloutes in 
it, and laye it ouerthwarte the temples. 
 
Also the seades and the heades of popie, 
called chessbolles, stamped wyth 
[^f.T2v^] 
rosewater, and myxte wyth womans 
mylke, and the whyte of an egge, beate~ 
al togyther and made in a playster, causeth 
the chylde to receyue hys naturall 
slepe. 
 
Also an oyntmente made of the seede 
of popie and the heades, one ou~ce, oyle 
of lettuse, and of popie, of eche .ii. ounces, 
make an oyntmente and vse it. 
 
They that can not gette these oyles, 
maye take the herbes, or iuyce of lettuse, 
purcelane, houseleke, and popie, 
and with womans mylke, make a playster, 
and laye it to the foreheade 
Oyle of vyolettes, of roses, of nenuphar, 
are good, and oyle of populeon, 
the broth of mallowes sodden, and the 
iuyce of water plantayne. 
 
[}Of terryble dreames and 
feare in the sleape.}] 
OFtentymes it happeneth 
that the chyld is afrayde 
in the slepe, and somtymes 
waketh sodaynlye, and 
sterteth sometime shryketh 
[^f.T3r^] 
tremblethe, whyche effecte commeth of 
the arysynge of stynkynge vapoures, 
oute of the stomacke into the fantasye, 
and sences of the brayne, as ye may perceyue 
by the breath of the childe wherfore 
it is good to gyue him a litle hony 
to swallowe, and a lytle pouder of the 
seedes of peony, and some tymes tryacle, 
in a lytle quantitie wyth mylk, and 
to take hede that the chylde slepe not 
wyth a full stomacke, but to beare it aboute 
wakynge, tyll parte be dygested 
and whan that it is layde, not to rocke 
it moche, for ouermoche shakynge 
letteth dygestion, and 
maketh the chyld 
manye tymes 
to vomyte. 
 
[}The fallynge euylle 
called in the greke 
tonge epilepsia.}] 
 
[^f.T3v^] 
NOt only other ages 
but also lytle chylderne, 
are oftentymes 
afflicted, wyth 
thys greuous sycknes, 
somtyme by nature 
receyued of the 
parentes, & than it 
is impossible, or difficile to cure, some 
tyme by euil & vnholsome dyete, where 
by there is enge~dred many colde and 
moyst humors in the brayne, whervpo~ 
this infirmitie procedeth, which if it be 
in one that is younge & tender, it is verye 
harde to be remoued, but in them y=t= 
are somewhat stronge, as of .vii. yeres 
and vpwarde, it is more easye. 
 
I fynde that manye thynges haue a 
naturall vertue agaynste the fallyng euell, 
not of any quality elementall, but 
by a singuler propertie, or rather an influence 
of heauen, whyche almyghtye 
god, hath gyuen vnto thynges here in 
earth, as be these and other. 
Saphires, smaragdes, redde coral, pyonie, 
[^f.T4r^] 
mystletow of the oke taken, in the 
monethe of marche, and the moone decreasynge, 
tyme, sauein, dylle and the 
stone y=t= is fou~de in the bellye of a yong 
swallow beyng the fyrste broode of the 
dame. These or one of them, hanged about 
the necke of the childe, saueth and 
preserueth it, from the sayde syckenes. 
Nowe wyl I descrybe some good and 
holsome medicines to be taken inward 
for the same dysease. 
 
If the chylde be not very young, the 
mawe of a leueret, dronke with water 
and honye, cureth the same. 
 
[}A medicine for the fallinge 
syckenes.}] 
Take the roote of pyony, and make 
it into poudre and gyue it to the childe 
to lycke in a lytle pappe and suger. 
They that are of age, maye eate of it a 
good quantitie atones and lykewise of 
the blacke seedes of the same pyonie. 
Item the purple violettes that creapeth 
on the grou~de in gardeynes wyth 
[^f.T4v^] 
a longe stalke, and is called in englyshe 
hertesease, dronken in water, or in water 
and honye, helpeth thys dysease in 
a young chylde. 
 
Moreouer the muscle of the eke rased 
and gyuen in mylke, or in water & 
honye is good. 
 
Also ye maye stylle a water, of the 
floures of lynde, it is a tree called in latyne 
tilia, the same wherof they make, 
ropes and halters of the barke, take y=e= 
same floures, and dystyll a water, and 
lette the pacient drynke of it nowe and 
than a sponefull, it is a good remedye. 
Item the rote of the sea thystle called 
Eringium in latyne, eaten in broth, 
or dronken is excedyng good. 
Some wryte that cicorie is a singuler 
remedye for the same dysease. It is 
mente by wylde cicorie, growyng in the 
cornes. 
The floures of rose marye, made in 
a conserua hath the same effecte in curynge 
this dysease. 
 
I coulde declare many other remedies, 
co~mended of authours, but at thys 
[^f.T5r^] 
tyme, these shall be sufficient. 
Nowe I wylle entreate somewhat 
of the palsey. 
 
[}Of the palseye or shakynge 
of membres.}] 
 
THe cure of the palsey 
in a chyld, is not lyke 
to that, whyche is in 
elder age, for the synowes 
of a chylde be 
verye nesshe, and tender, 
and therfore they 
ought to haue a moch 
weaker medicyne, euermore regardynge 
the power of the syckenes and 
the vertue or debilitie of the greued paciente. 
 
For sometymes the chylde can not 
lyfte nother legges, nor armes, whiche 
yf it happen durynge the suckyng than 
must the nource vse a dyet enclyning to 
hote and drye, and to eate spyces, as galingale, 
cinamome, gynger, macis, nutmygges, 
and suche other, wyth rosted 
[^f.T5v^] 
and fryed meates, but abstayne from 
mylke and al maner fysshe. And it shall 
be good for her, to eate a lectuary made 
after thys sorte. 
 
Take myntes, cynamome, cumyne, 
roseleaues dryed, mastyke, fenugreke, 
valerian, ameos doronici, zedoary, cloues, 
saunders, and lignum aloes, of euerye 
one, a dramme, muske halfe one 
dramme, make an electuarye wyth clarifyed 
honye, and let her eate of it, and 
gyue the chylde as much as halfe a nut 
euery daye to swalowe. 
 
[}A playster.}] 
Take an ounce of waxe, & a dramme 
of euphorbium, at the potecaries, and 
temper it wyth oyle olyue on the fyer, 
and make a sereclothe, to comforte the 
backe bone, and the synewes. 
 
[}A goodly lauatory for the 
same pourpose.}] 
Take lye of asshes, and seth therein 
baye buries, and asmoch pionie seedes, 
in a close vessel to the thyrde parte and 
wasshe the chylde often with the same 
[^f.T6r^] 
Item a bathe of sauerye, maiorym, 
tyme, sage, nepte, smallage, & myntes, 
or some of them is very good and holesome. 
 
Also to rubbe the backe of the chylde 
and the lymmes, wyth oyles of roses, 
and spyke, myxt togyther warme, and 
in stede of it ye may take oyle of bayes. 
 
[}Of the crampe or 
spasmus.}] 
THys disease is often sene among 
chyldren and commethe 
verye lightlye, as of debilitye 
of the nerues and cordes, or 
els of grosse humours, that suffocate 
the same, the cure of the whyche is declared 
of authours to be done by frictions 
and oyntmentes that comfort 
the synowes and dyssolue the matter, 
as oyle of floure de luyce, wyth a lytle 
anyse, saffro~ and the rootes of pyonye: 
Item oyle of camomyl, fenugreke, and 
mellilote, or the herbes sodden, betonie, 
wormwood, verueyne, and tyme are excedynge 
good to washe the chylde in. 
[^f.T6v^] 
Item the playster of euphorbium, 
written in the cure of palsey. 
 
[}Of the styfnes or starknes 
of lymmes.}] 
SOmetyme it happeneth y~ 
the limmes are starke, and 
can not well come togyther, 
wythoute the greater 
peyne, whyche thynge 
procedeth many tymes of 
colde, as wha~ a chylde is founde in the 
frost or in the strete, caste awaye by a 
wycked mother, or by some other chau~ce, 
although I am not ignorant that it 
may procede of manye other causes, as 
it is sayde of Rasis, and of Arnolde de 
villa noua, in hys booke of the cure of 
infantes. 
 
And here is to be noted, a wounderfulle 
secrete of nature, manye tymes 
approued, wrytten of Auicenne in hys 
fyrste Canon, and of Celius Antiquarum 
electionum, libro .xiii. capit .xxxvi. 
that whan a membre is vtterly benummed 
and taken thorough colde, so that 
[^f.T7r^] 
the paciente can not feele hys lymmes, 
nor mooue them accordynge to nature, 
by reason of the vehement congelatio~ 
of the blood, in suche case the chyefeste 
helpe or remedie is not to sette them to 
the fyer to receyue heate, for by that 
meanes, lyghtlye we se that euery one 
swowneth, and many dye oute ryghte, 
but to sette the fete, legges, and armes 
in a payle of clere colde water, whyche 
immediatlye shall dissolue the congelation, 
& restore the bloode, to the former 
passage and fredome, after that ye may 
laye the pacient in a bedde to sweate, & 
gyue hym hote drynke and cawdels or 
a coleys of a capo~ hote, wyth a lytle cynamome 
& saffro~ to co~forte y~ hart. An 
argume~te of this cure ye maye see thus 
 
When an apple or a pere is frosen in 
the wynter, sette it to the fyer, and it is 
destroyed: but yf ye putte it into colde 
water it shall as well endure, as it dyd 
afore, whereby it doth appere that the 
water resolueth colde, better wyth hys 
moysture, than the fyer can do by reason 
[^f.T7v^] 
of hys heate, for y~ water relenteth 
and the fyer draweth and dryeth, as affyrmeth 
Galiene in his booke of elementes. 
 
Hytherto haue I declyned by occasio~, 
but I truste not in vayne to the reder, 
nowe to my purpose. 
When a yonge chylde is so take~ wyth 
a colde, I esteme it best for to bathe the 
bodye in luke warme water, wherein 
hath ben sodden maiorym and tyme, ysope, 
sage, myntes, & suche other good 
and comfortable herbes, then to releue 
it wyth meates of good nouryshment, 
accordyng to the age and necessitie, and 
yf nede be, when ye se the lymmes yet 
to be starke, make an oyntment after 
this fourme. 
 
[}An oyntment for styffe and 
stoyned lymmes.}] 
Take a good handfull of nettles, & 
stampe them, then seeth them in oyle to 
the thyrde parte in a double vessel, kepe 
that oyntment in a drye place, for it wil 
last a great whyle, and is a singuler remedye 
[^f.T8r^] 
for the styfnesse that commeth 
of cold, and whoso anoynteth his handes 
and feete with it in the mornynge 
shall not be greued wyth colde all the 
daye after. 
 
The seedes of nettles gathered in haruest 
& kept for y~ same ente~t, is exceding 
good sodde~ in oyle or fryed w~ swynes 
grese, which thing also is very good to 
heale y~ kybbes of heeles, called in latin 
Perniones. The vryne of a goote w=t= 
the donge stamped & layed to the place, 
resolueth the styfnesse of lymmes. 
 
When the cause commeth not by extreme 
colde, but of some other affectio~ 
of the synowes and cordes, it is best to 
make a bath or a fome~tation of herbes 
that resolue and comfort the synowes, 
with relaxation of the grosse humours 
and to ope~ the pores as by exa~ple thus. 
Take malowes, holyhocke and dyll, of 
eche a handful or two, seeth them in the 
water of netes feete, or in broth of flesh 
wythout salt, wyth a handfull of bran 
and comyne, in the which ye shall bathe 
[^f.T8v^] 
the chylde, as warme as he may suffre, 
and yf ye see necessitie, make a playstre 
wyth the same herbes and laye it to the 
griefe, wyth a lytle gosegrese, or duckes 
grese, or yf it maye be gotten, oyle 
of camomylle, of lylyes, and of dylle. 
Cloutes wette in the sayde decoction, 
and layed about the membres, helpeth. 
 
[}Of bloodshotten eyes, 
and other infirmities.}] 
SOmtyme y=e= eyes are bloodshotten 
and other whyles 
encreasynge a fylthye and 
whyte humoure, couerynge 
the syght, the cause is often 
of to moche crying, for the whiche it is 
good to drop in the eyes a lytle of the 
iuceo nyghtshade, otherwyse called 
morel, and to anoynt the foreheed with 
the same, and yf the eye swell, to wette 
a cloute in the iuce, and the whyte of 
egges, and laye it to the grefe. 
 
If the humour be clammysshe and 
tough, and cleueth to the corners of the 
[^f.U1r^] 
eyes, so that the chylde can not open 
them after his slepe, it shallbe remoued 
with the iuce of houseleeke dropped on 
the eye with a fether. 
 
When the eye is bloodshotten and 
redde, it is a synguler remedye to put 
in it, the bloode of a yonge pigion, or a 
doue, or a partryche, eyther hote from 
the byrde, or els dried and made in pouder, 
as subtyle as maye be possyble. 
 
[}A playstre for swellyng and 
payne of the eyes.}] 
Take quynces and cromes of whyte 
breed, and seeth them in water tyl they 
be softe, then stampe them, and wyth a 
lytle saffron, and the yolkes of two egges, 
make a playster to the chyldes eyes 
and foreheed. Ye maye let hym also to 
receyue the fume of that decoction. It 
is also good in the meygrym: yf ye wyl 
haue further, loke in the regyment of 
lyfe in the declaration of paynes of the 
heed. 
 
[}Of watrynge eyes.}] 
 
[^f.U1v^] 
IF the chyldes eyes water 
ouermoche wythout 
crying, by reason of a distillation 
co~myng from 
the heed, Manardus teacheth 
a goodly playstre, 
to restrayne the reumes 
and is made thus. 
 
Hartes horne brente to pouder, and 
wasshed twyse, guaiacum, otherwyse 
called lignu~ sanctu~, corticu~ thuris, antimonye, 
of eche one part, muske the .iii 
parte of one parte, make a fyne pouder 
and vse it w~ the iuce or water of fenell. 
These thynges haue vertue to stau~che 
y=e= rennyng of eyes. The shelles of snayles 
brent, the tycke that is found in the 
dugges of kyne, philipendula, frankensence 
& the whyte of an egge layed vpo~ 
the foreheed, flewort or the water wher 
in it is steped, tutie, the water of buddes 
of oke stylled, beanefloure fynelye 
syfted, and w=t= the gu~me of a cherytree 
steped i~ vinegre, & layd ouer al y=e= te~ples. 
 
[}Of scabbynesse and ytche.}] 
[^f.U2r^] 
SOmetyme by reason of excesse 
of heate, or sharpenesse 
in the mylke, throughe the 
nourses eatyng of salt and 
eygre meates, it happeneth 
that a chyld is sene ful of ytch 
by rubbing, fretyng, and chafynge of it 
selfe, encresyng a scabbe called of the 
Grekes Psora: whyche thynge also 
chau~ceth vnto many after they be weaned, 
proceding of salt & adust humoures, 
the cure whereof dyffereth in none 
other, but accordyng to y=e= difference of 
age, for in a suckyng babe y=e= medicines 
may not be so sharpe, as it maye be suffered 
in one that is all redye weaned. 
Agaynste suche vnkynde ytche, ye maye 
make an oyntment thus. 
 
Take water betony .ii. good handfulles, 
daysye leaues, and alehofe otherwyse 
called tu~nour or grounde yuye, of 
eche one handfull, the red docke rootes, 
two or thre, stampe them all togyther, 
and grynde them well, then myngle the~ 
wyth fresshe grese, and agayne stampe 
[^f.U2v^] 
them. Let them so stande .viii. dayes to 
putrifye tyll it be hore, then frye them 
out and strayne them and kepe it for y=e= 
same entent. 
 
This oyntment hath a greate effecte, 
both in yonge and olde, and that wythout 
repercussion or dryuing backe of y=e= 
matter, whyche shoulde be a peryllouse 
thynge for a yonge chylde. 
 
The herbe water betonye alone, is a 
great medicyne to quenche all vnkynde 
heates without daunger, or y~ sethyng 
of it in cleare welle water, to annoynte 
the membres. It is a co~mon herbe, and 
groweth by ryuers sydes and smal renning 
waters, and wette places, arysing 
many times the heygth of a man out of 
the grounde, where he reioyseth, wyth 
a stalke foure square, and many braunches 
on euery syde, and also it beareth a 
whytysh blewe flowre very small, and 
in haruest it hath innumerable seedes, 
blacke, and as fyue as the seede of tutsone 
or lesse, the leues bygge and long, 
accordyng to the grounde, full of myce, 
[^f.U3r^] 
iagged on the sydes lyke a sawe, euen 
as other betonye, to whome it approcheth 
in figure, and opteineth his name 
of water betonye. The sauoure of the 
leafe is somewhat heauye, mooste lyke 
to y=e= sauour of elders or walwort, but 
when it is brused it is more pleasaunt, 
whyche thyng induceth me to vary fro~ 
the myndes of them that thynke thys 
herbe to be Galiopsis in Dioscorides, 
wrytten of hym that it shoulde stynke 
when it is stamped, but the more thys 
herbe is stamped, the more swete and 
herbelyke it sauoureth: therfore it can 
not be galeopsis, and besydes that, it is 
neuer founde in drye and stony ground 
as the Galiopsis is. Neyther is thys 
herbe mencyoned of the newe or olde 
authours, as farre as I can see, but of 
onely Uigo, y=e= famous surgyon of our 
tyme in Italye, whyche wryteth on it, 
that thys herbe exceadeth all other in a 
malo mortuo (so calleth he a kynde of 
leprye elephantyk, or an vniuersal and 
fylthye scabbe of all the bodye) and in 
[^f.U3v^] 
lyke maner he sayeth it is good for to 
cure a canker in the breastes. Ye maye 
reade these thynges in his second boke, 
Capitul .iii. and hys fyfth booke of the 
Frenche pockes, in the thyrde chapter: 
where he doth descrybe thys aforesayd 
herbe, wyth so manyfeste tokens, that 
no man wyl doubt it to be water betonye, 
conferryng the boke and the herbe 
duly togyther. Moreouer he nameth in 
Italye a brydge where it groweth in 
the water in greate aboundaunce, and 
called of that nacyon Alabeneratore, 
whych in dede the Italyons that come 
hyther and knowe bothe the place and 
the herbe do affyrme playnely, it is our 
water betonye. 
 
And where as he allegeth Dioscorides 
in clymeno, whych by co~templatio~ 
of both hath but small affinitie or none 
wyth thys herbe, it was for nothynge 
els but lack of the tonges, which faute 
is not to be so hyghly rebuked in a man 
of his studye, applyinge hym selfe more 
in the practyse of surgerye, & to handye 
[^f.U4r^] 
operation, wherein in dede he was nere 
incomparable, then he dyd to search the 
varyaunce of tonges, & rather regarded 
to declare y=e= operation of thynges w=t= 
truthe, then to despute vpon y~ propertyes 
of names with eloquence. 
 
Thus haue I declyned agayne from 
my matter, partly to shewe the descryptio~ 
of this holesome herbe, partely to 
satysfye the myndes of the surgions in 
Uigo, whiche haue hytherto redde the 
sayde places in vayne: & furthermore 
bycause there is yet none that declareth 
manifestly the same herbe. 
 
[}An other remedye for 
scabbes and ytche.}] 
Take the rootes of dockes, and frye 
them i~ fresh grese, then put to it a qua~titie 
of brymstone in pouder, and vse to 
rubbe the places twyse or thryse a day. 
Brimstone poudred and souped i~ a rere 
egge healeth the scabbes, whych thyng 
is also very good to destroye wormes. 
 
[}A goodly swete sope for 
scabbes and ytche.}] 
[^f.U4v^] 
Take whyte sope halfe a pounde, 
& stepe it in suffycient rose water, tyl it 
be well soked, then take two drammes 
of mercurye sublymed, dissolue it in a 
lytle rosewater, labour the sope and the 
rosewater wel together, and afterward 
put in it a lytl_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] muske or cyuette, and 
kepe it. This sope is excedynge good to 
cure a greate scabbe or ytche, and that 
wythoute peryll, but in a chylde it shall 
suffyce to make it weaker of the mercurye. 
 
[}An other approued medicyne 
for scabbynesse & ytche.}] 
Take fumyterrie, docke rootes, scabiouse, 
and the roote of walwort, sta~pe 
the~ all, & set them in freshe grese to putrifie, 
then frye them and strayne them 
in whych lycour ye shal put turpentine 
a lytle quantitie, brymstone, and frankensence 
very fynely poudred and syfted 
a portion, and with sufficient waxe 
make an oyntment on a softe fyre: thys 
is a synguler remedye for the same purpose, 
But i~ thys cure ye ought to gyue 
[^f.U5r^] 
the chylde no egges, nor anye eygre 
or sharpe meat, and the nurse also must 
auoyde the same, and not to wrappe it 
in to hoote, and yf neade be, to make a 
bath of fumiterrye, centaurye, fetherfewe, 
tansie, wormewood, and sauge alone, 
yf ye se the cause of the ytche or 
the scabbe to be wormes in the skynne, 
for a bytter decoction shal destroy them 
and drye vp the moystures of the sores. 
 
[}Of diseases in the eares.}] 
MAny dyseases happe~ in the 
eares, as payne, apostemes 
swellynges, tynklyng and 
sou~d i~ y=e= heed, stoppyng of 
the organes of hearynge: 
Water, wormes, & other 
infortunes gotten into the eares, wherof 
some of them are daungerous and 
harde to be cured, some other expelled 
of nature without medicyne. 
 
[}Remedye for payne in the eares.}] 
For payne in the eares withoute a 
manifest cause, as often chaunceth, it 
is a singuler remedye to take the chest 
[^f.U5v^] 
wormes, that are founde vnder barkes 
of trees, or in other stumpes i~ y=e= grou~d 
and wyll tourne rounde lyke a pease, 
take of them a good quantytye, and 
seeth them in oyle, in the rynde of a 
pomegranade on the hote ymbres, that 
it brenne not, and after that strayne it 
and put into the eares a droppe or two 
luke warme, and then lette hym lye 
vpon the other eare, and reste. Ye maye 
gyue thys to all ages, but in a chylde ye 
must put a very lytle quantitie. 
 
[}An other.}] 
The hame or skynne of an adder or a 
snake, that she casteth, boyled in oyle, & 
dropped into the eares, easeth y=e= payne 
and it is also good for an eare that mattereth 
myngled with a lytle honye, and 
put in luke warme. It is also good to 
droppe into y=e= eares the iuyce of organye 
and mylke. 
 
[}For swellyng vnder 
the eares.}] 
Paynters oyle, which is oyle of lyneseed 
is excedyng good for the swellyng 
[^f.U6r^] 
of the eares, and for payne in the eares 
of all causes. 
 
Item a playster made of lyneseede & 
dylle, with a lytle duckes grese & honye. 
 
Yf ye se the aposteme breke, & renne 
ye maye clense it with the iuce of smallache, 
the whyte of an egge, barly flour, 
& honye, which is a co~mon playstre to 
mundifye a sore. 
 
When the eares haue receyued water 
or any other licour, it is good to take 
and stampe an onyon and wryng out y=e= 
iuce with a lytle gosegrese, and droppe 
it hote into the eare as it may be suffred 
and laye hym downe one the contrarye 
syde an houre, after that cause hym to 
nese yf his age wyll suffre, wyth a lytle 
p_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]llitorie of Spayne, or nesingpouder, 
and then enclyne hys eare downewarde: 
that the water maye yssue. 
 
[}For wormes in the eares.}] 
Take myrre, aloes, and the seede of 
colocynthis, called coloquintida of the 
apothecaries, a quantity of eche, seethe 
them i~ oyle of roses, & put a litle i~ y=e= eare 
[^f.U6v^] 
Myrre hath a great vertue to remoue 
the stynche that is caused in the eares 
by any putrefaction, and y~ better wyth 
oyle of bytter almons, or ye may take 
y~ iuce of wormewood wyth hony and 
salt peter. 
 
[}For wynde in the eares 
and tynklynge.}] 
Take myrre, spykenarde, cumyne, 
dylle, and oyle of camomylle, and put a 
droppe i~ the eares. They that haue not 
all these maye take some of them, and 
applye it accordyng to discretion. 
 
To amende deafnesse ye shall make 
an oyntment of an hares galle, and the 
grese or droppynge of an ele, which is a 
souerayne thyng to recouer hearyng. 
 
[}Of nesyng out of measure.}] 
WHen a chylde neseth oute of 
measure, that is to saye, w=t= 
a longe continuaunce, and 
therby the brayne and vertues 
animall be febled, it is 
good to stoppe it, to auoyde a further i~conuenience. 
[^f.U7r^] 
Wherfore ye shall annoynt the heade, 
wyth the iuyce of purcelane, sorell, and 
nyghtshade, or some of them and make 
a playster of the whyte of an egge, and 
the iuyce, wyth a lytle oyle of roses, & 
emplayster the forheade and temples, 
wyth the mylke of a woman, oyle of roses, 
and vynegre a lytle. 
 
If it come of colde reume, ye shall 
make a playster of mastyke, frankynsens, 
myrre, wyne, and applye it to the 
former parte of the head. A fume of the 
same receyued in flaxe, and layed vpon 
the chyldes head, is holsome. 
 
[}Breedynge of teeth.}] 
ABout y~ seue~th moneth, somtyme 
more, sometyme lesse after 
y=e= byrthe, it is natural for 
a chyld for to breede teeth, in 
which time many one is sore 
vexed, w=t= so~drye diseases & peynes, as 
swelling of y=e= gummes & iawes, vnquiete 
cryenge, feuers, crampes, palsies, 
fluxes, reumes, & other i~firmities, speciallye 
whan it is longe or the teeth come 
[^f.U7v^] 
forth, for the soner they apere, the better, 
and the more ease it is to the chylde 
There be diuers thynges that are good 
to procure an easy breedyng of teeth, among 
whom the chiefest is to annoynt 
the gummes, wyth the braynes of an 
hare, myxte wyth asmuch capons grece 
and honye, or anye of these thynges alone, 
is exceadynge good to supple the 
gummes and the synewes. 
 
Also it is good to wasshe the chylde 
two or three tymes, in a weeke, wyth 
warme water, of the decoction of camamyll, 
hollyhocke and dylle. 
 
Fresshe butter, wyth a lyttle barlye 
floure, or honye, wyth the fyne pouder 
of frankinsence & liquirice, are comme~ded 
of good authours for y~ same entent 
 
And whan the peyne is greatte, and 
intollerable, wyth aposteme or inflammation 
of the goummes, it is good to 
make an oyntmente of oyle of roses, w=t= 
the iuyce of morelle, otherwyse called 
nyghtshade, and in lacke of it, annoynt 
the iawes wythin, wyth a lytle fresshe 
[^f.U8r^] 
butter and honye. 
 
For lacke of the hares brayne, ye 
may take the conyes, for they be also of 
thy kynde of hares, and called of Plinye 
Dasypodes, whose mawes, are of 
the same affecte in medicyne, or rather 
more, than is wrytten of authoures, of 
the mawes of hares. 
 
If ye se the gummes of the chyld to 
aposteme or swelle wyth softe flesshe, 
full of matter and paynefulle, the beste 
shall be to annoynt the sore place wyth 
the brayne of an hare, & capons grece, 
equallye myxt togyther, and after that 
ye haue vsed thys, ones or twyse, annoynte 
the gommes, and apostemations 
wyth honye. 
Thyrdlye yf thys helpe not, take turpentyne 
myxte wyth a lytle honye in equal 
portion. And make a bathe for the 
head of the chylde, in this fourme. 
 
Take the floures of camomylle and 
dyll, of eche an handeful, seeth them in 
a quarte of pure rennynge water, vntil 
they be tender, and wasshe the head afore 
[^f.U8v^] 
anye meate, euery mornynge, for it 
pourgeth the superfluytye of the braynes, 
thorough the seames of the skull, 
and wythdraweth humours from the 
sore place, fynally comforteth y=e= brayne 
& all the vertues anymall of the chyld. 
 
To cause an easie breedyng of teeth, 
many thinges are rehersed of auctours 
besydes the premisses, as the fyrste cast 
tooth of a colte set in syluer and borne, 
or redde coralle in lyke maner, hanged 
about the necke, whervppon the chylde 
shulde oftentymes labour his gummes 
and manye other lyke, whyche I leaue 
out at this tyme, to auoyde tediousnes 
onely content to declare thys of corall, 
that by consent of all authours, it resisteth 
the force of lyghtenynge, helpeth 
the chyldren of the fallynge euyll, and 
is very good, to be made in pouder, and 
dronken agaynst all maner of bleedyng 
of the nose or fundament. 
 
[}Of a canker in the 
mouthe.}] 
 
[^f.X1r^] 
MAny tymes by reso~ of corruptio~ 
of the mylke, venymous 
vapoures arysynge 
fro~ the stomake, & 
of many other in fortunes, 
there chau~ceth to brede 
a canker in the mouthes of chyldren, 
whose sygnes are manifest ynough, y~ 
is to saye by stinkynge of the mouthe, 
peyne in the place, contynual rennynge 
of spyttle, swellyng of the cheke, and 
when the mouth is opened agaynst the 
so~ne, ye maye se clereye where the ca~ker 
lyeth. It is so named of the latter sorte 
of phisitions by reason of crepynge & 
eatynge forwarde & backewarde, and 
spreadeth it selfe abrode, lyke y~ feete of 
a creuis, called in latyne ca~cer, notwithstandynge 
I knowe that the Greekes, 
and aunciente latynes, gyue other names 
vnto this dysease, as in callyng it 
an vlcer, other whyles aphthe, nome, 
carcinomat_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], and lyke, whiche are al in 
englyshe, knowen by the name of canker 
in the mouthe, and although there 
[^f.X1v^] 
be many kyndes accordyng to the matter 
wherof they be engendred, and therfore 
requyre a dyuersitie of curyng, yet 
for the most parte, whan they be in chylderne 
the cure of them all differeth verye 
lytle or nothyng, for the chyefe entent 
shall be to remoue the malignitye 
of the sore, and to drye vp the noysome 
matter and humours, than to mundify 
and heale, as in other kyndes of vlcers 
sores, and woundes. 
 
[}Remedies for the canker in 
the mouthe of children.}] 
TAke drye redde roses, & 
violettes, of eche a lyke 
quantity, make them in 
pouder: and myxte them, 
with a lytle honye, thys 
medycyne is verye good 
in a tender suckynge chylde, and many 
times healeth alone, without any other 
thing at all. But yf ye se there be great 
heate & burnynge in the sore, with excedyng 
payne ye shal make a iuyce of purselane, 
[^f.X2r^] 
lettuse & nyghteshade, & wasshe 
the sore wyth a fyne peyce of sylke or 
dryue it in wyth a spoute called of the 
surgions a sprynge. 
 
Thys by the grace of God, shall abate 
the brennynge, aswage the peyne, 
and kyll the venyme of the vlcer. 
 
But yf ye se the canker yet encrease 
wyth greate corruption and matter, ye 
shal make an oyntme~t after this maner 
 
Take myrre, galles wherewyth they 
make ynke, or in defaute of them, oken 
apples dryed, frankynsence, of eche a 
lyke moche, of the blake buries growynge 
on the bramble, taken frome the 
busshe whyle they be grene, the thyrde 
parte of al y=e= reste, make them al in pouder, 
& myxte them with asmoch honye & 
saffron, as is sufficient, and vse it. 
 
[}A stronger medicine for the ca~ker 
in the mouth of children.}] 
Take the roote of celidonie dryed, 
the rynde of a pomegranate, redde corall 
in pouder, and the pouder of a hartes 
horne, of eche a lyke, roche alume 
[^f.X2v^] 
a lytle, Fyrste wasshe the place wyth 
wyne, or warme water, and honye, and 
afterwarde putte on the foresayd pouder, 
very fyne and subtile. 
 
[}An other synguler medicyne 
for the canker in the mouthe 
of all ages,}] 
+R. ysope, sage, rue, of eche one good 
handefull, sethe them in wyne and water, 
to the thyrde part, then strayne the~ 
out, and putte in it a lytle whyte coperose, 
accordynge to necessytye, that is 
to saye, whan the sore is greatte, putte 
in the more, whan it is smalle ye maye 
take the lesse, than adde to it a quantitie 
of honye clarifyed, and a sponefull 
or .ii. of good aqua vite, washe y=e= place 
wyth it, for it is a synguler remedy, to 
remooue the malyce in a shorte whyle, 
whyche done ye shall make a water incarnatyue 
and healynge thus. 
 
R+ rybworte, betonye and daysies, of 
eche a handefull, seethe them in wyne, 
and water, and wasshe hys mouthe .ii. 
or .iii. tymes a day wyth the same iuce. 
[^f.X3r^] 
Moreouer some wryte, y=t= cristal made 
in fyne pouder, hath a singuler vertue 
to destroye the canker, and in lyke maner 
the pouder of an hartes borne bre~t 
wyth asmoche of the rynde of a pomegranade, 
and the iuyce of nygthshade, 
is very good and holsome. 
 
[}Of quinsye and swellynge 
of the throte.}] 
THe qui~sie is a dau~gerous sickenes, 
bothe in yonge & olde, called 
in latyne angina, it is an infla~mation 
of the necke w=t= swellyng 
& great peyne, somtyme it lyeth in 
the verye throte, vpon the wesant pipe, 
& tha~ it is excedyng perillous for it stoppeth 
the breath, and stra~guleth the pacient 
anone. Other whyles it breaketh 
out lyke a bonche on the one syde of the 
necke, and than also with verye great 
difficultie of breathyng, but it choketh 
not so sone as the fyrste doeth, and it is 
more obedient to receyue curatio~. The 
signes are aparaunt to syght and besydes 
[^f.X3v^] 
that the chylde can not crye, nether 
swallowe downe his meat and drynke 
wythout payne. 
 
[}Remedye.}] 
It is good to annoynt the grefe with 
oyle of dylle, or oyle of camomyll, and 
lylies, and to laye vpon the heade, hote 
cloutes dipte in the waters of rosemary, 
lauender, and sauery. 
 
The chyefeste remedye commended 
of authours in this outragious syckenes, 
is the pouder of a swallowe brent 
wyth fethers and all, and myxte wyth 
honye, whereof the pacient must swallowe 
downe a lytle, & the rest anoynted 
vpon the payne. They prayse also the 
pouder of the chyldes dunge to y=e= chyld 
and of a ma~ to a man, brent in a potte, & 
anoynted with a litle honye. Somme 
make a compouned oyntment of bothe, 
the receyte is thus. +R. of the swallowe 
brent, one portion: of the seco~d poudre 
another, make it in a thycke fourme w=t= 
honye, and it wyll endure longe for the 
same entent. 
 
[^f.X4r^] 
Item an other experimente for the 
quinsy and swellynge vnder the eares. 
Take the musherim that groweth vpon 
an elder tre, called in englysshe iewes 
eares (for it is in dede cro~cled and 
flat, mouch lyke an eare) heate it agai~st 
the fyer, and put it hote in any drynke, 
the same drynke is good and holsome 
for the quynsy. 
Some holde opinio~ that who so vseth 
to drynke wyth it, shall neuer be troubled 
wyth this dysease, and therefore 
carye it about with them in iorneys. 
 
[}Of the cough.}] 
THe cough in chyldren for the 
moste parte, procedeth either 
of a colde, or by reason of 
rewmes: descendynge from 
the head into the pypes of the 
longes or the breast, and that is moste 
commonlye by ouermoche aboundaunce 
of mylke, corruptynge the stomake 
and brayne, therfore in that 
case, it is good to feede the childe wyth 
a more slendre dyete, and to annoynt 
[^f.X4v^] 
the heade ouer, wyth honye, and 
nowe and than to presse his tonge with 
your fynger, holdynge downe his head 
that the reumes maye issue, for by that 
meanes the cause of the cough shall ren 
out of hys mouth, & auoyde the chylde 
of many noughtie and slymy humours 
whyche done many tymes the paciente 
amendeth, wythout any further helpe 
of medicine. 
 
[}For the cough in a childe.}] 
Take gomme arabik, gumme dragagant, 
quynce seedes, liquyrice and penidies, 
at the pothecaries, breake them al 
togyther, and gyue the chylde to suppe 
a lytle at ones, wyth a draught of milk 
newely warme, as it co~meth from the 
cowe. 
 
Also stampe blaunched almons, and 
wrynge them out wyth the iuyce of fenell, 
or water of fenell, and gyue it to 
the chylde to feade wyth a lytle suger. 
 
[}Agaynste the great cough, and 
heate in the bodye.}] 
The heades of whyte poppye, and 
[^f.X5r^] 
gumme dragagant, of eche a lyke moch 
longe cucumer seades, as moche as al, 
seth them in whaye, wyth raysons and 
suger, and lette the chylde drynke of it 
twyse or thryes a daye luke warme, or 
colde. 
 
[}Of straytenes of wynde.}] 
AGaynste the straytenes of brethyng 
whiche is no quinsie, the 
consent of authours do attribute 
a greate effecte, to lineseede 
made in poudre, and tempered 
with hony for the chylde to swallowe 
downe, a lytle at ones. I fynde also y=e= 
the milke of a mare newlye receyued of 
the child wyth suger, is a synguler remedye 
for the same pourpose. 
Whyche thynge moreouer, is exceding 
holsome to make the belye laxe wyth 
out trouble. 
 
[}Of weaknes of the stomacke 
and vomytynge.}] 
[^f.X5v^] 
MAny times the stomacke of the 
chyld is so feble that it cannot 
retayne eyther meate or dri~ke, 
in which case, and for all debilitye 
thereof, it is very good, to wasshe 
the stomake, with warme water of roses, 
wherin a lytle muske hath bene 
dyssolued for that by the odour and natural 
heate gyueth a comforte to all the 
spirituall membres. 
And than it is good to roste a quynce 
tender, and wyth a lyttle pouder of cloues 
and suger, to gyue it to the chylde: 
to eate conserua quynces, wyth a lyttle 
cynamome and cloues is singuler good 
for the same entent. Also ye may make 
a iuyce of quynces & gyue it to the child 
to drynke wyth a lytle suger. 
 
[}An oyntment for the 
stomacke.}] 
Take gallia muscata at the pothecaryes 
.xx. grayne weyght, myrrhe a very 
lytle, make it vp in oyntmente fourme, 
wyth oyle of mastyke, and water of roses 
sufficient, thys is a very good oyntment 
[^f.X6r^] 
for the stomacke. 
 
[}An other singuler receyte.}] 
Take mastyk, frankinse~ce, and drye 
redde roses, as moche as is sufficiente, 
make them in pouder, and temper them 
vp, wyth the iuyce of myntes, and a 
sponefull of vynegre and vse it. 
 
[}An other.}] 
Take wheate floure, and parche it on 
a panne, tylle it begynne to brenne and 
waxe redde, than stampe it with vynegre, 
and adde to it, the yolkes of .ii. egges 
harde rosted, mastyke, gumme, and 
frankensence sufficient, make a plaistre 
and laye it to the stomake. 
 
[}To recouer an appetyte lost.}] 
Take a good handfull of ranke and 
lustye rewe, and seeth it in a pynt of vinegre 
to the thyrde parte or lesse, and 
make it very stronge, wherof yf it be a 
childe, ye maye take a tooste of browne 
bread, and stampe it with the same vynegre, 
and laye it playstrewyse to the 
stomake, and for a stronger age besydes 
the playstre, lette hym suppe mornynge 
[^f.X6v^] 
and euenyng of the same vynegre. 
This is also good to recouer a stomak 
lost, by comynge to a fyre after a longe 
iourney, and hath also a synguler vertue 
to restore a man that swowneth. 
 
[}An experiment often approued 
of Rasis for the vomyte 
of chyldren.}] 
Rasis a solempne practicioner amo~g 
phisicions, affirmeth that he healed a 
greate multitude of this dysease onelye 
wyth the practyse folowynge which he 
taketh to be of great effecte in all lyke 
cases. 
 
Fyrst he maketh as it were an el_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]tuarye 
of pothecarye stuffe, that is to 
saye, lignum aloes, mastyke, of euerye 
one halfe a dramme, galles halfe a scrupule 
make a lectuarye wyth syrupe of 
roses, and gallia muscata and sugre. 
 
Of this he gaue the children to eate a 
very lytle at ones and ofte~. Afterward 
he made a playster thus. +R, mastyke, aloes, 
sloes, galles, frankensence, and 
brent breed, of eche a like portion, make 
[^f.X7r^] 
a plaistre with oyle and syrupe of roses 
to be layed to the childes stomake hote. 
 
[}An other oyntment for the stomake, 
descrybed of Wilhel. 
Placentino.}] 
Take oyle of mastyke or of wormewood 
.ii ounces, waxe, thre ou~ces, cloues, 
maces, and cynamome of eche, thre 
drammes, make an oyntment, addynge 
in the ende a lytle vynegre. 
The yolke of an egge harde rosted, mastyke, 
frankensence and gumme, made 
in a plaistre with oyle of quinces, is excedyng 
good for the same purpose. 
 
[}Of yeaxyng or hycket.}] 
 
IT chaunceth oftentymes 
that a chylde yeaxeth out 
of measure. Wherfore it is 
expedyent to make the stomake 
eygre afore it be fed, 
& not to replenyshe it wyth 
to moche at ones, for this disease commo~ly 
procedeth of fulnes: for yf it come 
of emptinesse, or of sharpe humours in 
[^f.X7v^] 
the mouth of the stomake, whiche is 
seldom sene: the cure is the~ very diffycil 
and daungerous. 
 
[}Remedye.}] 
When it co~meth of fulnesse y=t= a child 
yeaxeth incessauntlye without measure 
and that by a lo~g custome, it is good to 
make hi~ vomyt w=t= a fether, or by some 
other light meanes, y~ the matter which 
causeth the yeaxynge, maye yssue and 
vncombre the stomak, that done, bryng 
it a slepe, and vse to annoynt y=e= stomak 
wyth oyles of castor, spyke, camomyll, 
and dyll, or two or thre of them, ioyned 
togyther warme. 
 
[}Of colycke and rumblynge 
in the guttes.}] 
 
PEyne in the belly is a co~mon 
dysease of children, 
it co~meth eyther of woormes, 
or of takinge colde, 
or of euylle mylke, the sygnes 
thereof are to well 
knowen for the childe can not rest, but 
cryeth, & fretteth it self, & manye tymes, 
can not make theyr vryne, by reason of 
[^f.X8r^] 
wynde, that oppresseth the necke of the 
bladder, & is knowen also, by the me~bre 
in a man child, whyche in this case, is 
alwaye styffe, & pryckynge, moreouer y~ 
noyse & ro~blyng in the guttes, hyther 
& thither declareth y=e= child to be greued, 
with wynde in the bellye and colik. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
The nourse muste auoyde all maner 
meates that enge~dre winde, as beanes, 
peason, butter, harde egges, and suche. 
Then wasshe the chyldes bellye wyth 
hote water wherin hath ben sodden comyne, 
dylle and fenell, after that make 
a playstre of oyle and waxe, and clappe 
it hote vpon a cloth vnto the bellye. 
 
[}An other good playstre 
for the same entent.}] 
Take good stale ale and fresh butter, 
seeth them with an handfull of comyne 
poudred, and after put it all togyther 
into a swynes bladder, & byndthe 
mouthe faste, that the lycoure yssue 
not out, the~ wynde it in a cloth, & turne 
it vp and downe vpo~ the belly as hote 
[^f.X8v^] 
as the pacient maye suffer, this is good 
for the colyke after a sodayne colde, in 
all ages, but in chyldre~ ye must beware 
ye applye it not to hote. 
 
[}Of fluxe of the bellye.}] 
MAny times it happeneth 
eyther by takyng colde, 
or by reso~ of great paine 
in breedynge of teethe, 
or els through salt and 
eygre fleume or cholere 
enge~dred in y=e= bodye, y~ 
the childe falleth into a sodayne laxe, 
which yf it longe co~tinue & be not holpen, 
it may bryng y~ pacient to extreme 
leanesse, & consumptio~: wherfore it shal 
be good to seke some holsome remedy & 
to stoppe the rennyng of the fluxe thus. 
 
[}Remedye for the fluxe in a chylde.}] 
Fyrst make a bath of herbes that do 
restrayne, as of plantayne, saint Iohns 
weede called ypericon, knotgrasse, bursa 
pastoris and other suche, or some of 
them, and vse to bath him in it as hote 
as he may wel suffre, then wrappe him 
[^f.AA1r^] 
in w=t= clothes, & laye him downe to slepe. 
 
And yf ye se by this twyse or thryse 
vsynge, that the bellye be not stopped: 
Ye maye take an egges yolke harde rosted, 
and grynde it with a lytle saffron, 
myrrhe and wyne, make a playster, and 
applye it to the nauyl hote. Yf this succede 
not, then it shalbe necessarye for to 
make a poudre to gyue him in his meate 
with a litle sugre and in a smal quantitie 
thus. 
Take the poudre of hartes horne bre~t, 
y~ pondre of gootes clawes, or of swynes 
clawes bre~t, the poudre of the seede 
of roses whyche remayne in the berye 
when the rose is fallen, of euerye one a 
portion, make them very fine, & with 
good redde wyne or almon mylke, and 
wheat floure, make it as it were a paste 
and drye it in lytle balles tyll ye se necessitie, 
it is a singuler remedie i~ al suche 
cases. 
 
Item the mylke wherin hath bene 
sodden whyte paper, and afterwarde 
quenched, manye hote yrons or gaddes 
[^f.AA1v^] 
of stele, is excedynge good for the same 
entent to drynke. 
 
And here is to be noted, that a natural 
fluxe is neuer to be feared afore the 
.vii. day, and except there issue blood, 
it ought not to be stopped afore the 
sayde tyme. 
 
Pouder of the herbe called knotgrasse 
or the iuce therof in a posset dronken, 
or a playstre of the same herbe, & 
of bursa pastoris, bolearmenye, and the 
iuce of plantayne with a lytle vynegre, 
and wheate floure is excedynge good 
for the same cause. 
 
Also the ryndle mawe of a yonge suckynge 
kydde gyuen to the chylde, the 
weight of .x. graynes, with y~ yolke of 
an egge softe rosted, and let the patient 
abstayne from mylke by the space of .ii. 
houres before and after, in stede wherof 
ye may gyue a rosted quince or a warden 
wyth a lytle sugre and cynamome 
to eate.
