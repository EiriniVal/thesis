with childe, or no. 
 
CHAP. 1.}] 
 
A Chirurgion must bee very circumspect, 
in determining whether 
a woman be conceiued, or 
no; because many haue preiudiced 
their knowledge, and discretion, 
by iudging rashly hereof. 
For there is nothing more 
ridiculous, then to assure a woman that shee is 
with childe; and afterward, that her naturall sicknesse, 
[/1./] 
or store of water should come from her: 
and in stead of a childe, some windie matter should 
breake from her, and so her belly fall, and grow 
flat againe: which hath hapned vnto many men, 
that haue beene well esteemed, both for their 
learning, and experience. And wee haue seene 
the experience hereof in some women, which were 
(without all question) thought to be so great, that 
[/2./] 
the Midwife was euen ready to receiue the child: 
who notwithstanding haue beene freed and acquitted 
heereof either by their naturall purgings 
and euacuations, or by voiding of water, or else expelling 
of winde. The which hapned vnto Mad. P. 
to her great griefe, who was deliuered of certaine 
gallons of water, when she thought assuredly that 
she had beene with childe. I saw the contrary happen 
to the daughter of M. Marcel: who was iudged 
[^p.3^] 
by foure of the chiefe Physitians, and as many Chirurgions, 
and two Midwiues, not to haue beene 
with childe; and yet being dead, there was found 
in her body, a child betweene six and seuen months 
old. And of late memorie, some of the most expert 
Physitians, and Chirurgions of our time, vndertooke 
[/3./] 
the cure of an honest woman; and from 
the third vntill the eighth moneth of her time, administred 
vnto her infinite many Clisters, Apozemes, 
Potions, Fomentations, and Iniections, 
and yet could not they prouoke her naturall sicknesse, 
much lesse cause her to be deliuered. At 
length in the ninth moneth, she thinking that she 
had had the Chollicke, was brought a bed of a faire 
daughter, being verily perswaded euen then when 
she was in trauaile that she was not with child, as 
she had assured vs, all the time that she went. So 
[/4./] 
that a Chirurgion being called to giue his opinion 
of the conception of a woman, whether it be in a 
iudiciall, or priuate case, must be very warie and 
circumspect what iudgement he giues herein. 
 
The ancient and moderne writers haue left some 
signes whereby we may foretell it, which are collected 
from the Husband, from the Wife, from the 
Child, and from the Midwife. 
 
As for those signes which are taken from the 
[/5./] 
Man, they are these: If he finde an extraordinarie 
contentment in the companie of his Wife; and if 
he feele at the same time a kind of sucking or drawing 
at the end of his yard; if he returne from the 
field of nature, not ouer-moyst, these are signes that 
[^p.4^] 
a woman may haue conceiued. And by these obseruations 
[/6./] 
I haue knowne men which haue assured 
their Wiues that they haue got them with child, 
as soone as they haue had their company. 
 
[/7./] 
The signes which are taken from the Woman 
are more manifest and certaine: and although the 
greatest part of them bee found in Women and 
Maids, which cannot haue their naturall courses: 
yet neuerthelesse all these signes ioyned together, 
a man may presume as farre of them as arte wil permit, 
and they be these: If she receiued an extraordinarie 
delight in the companie of her Husband: 
if from her naturall parts (whether they continue 
dry or moist) there issue or flow nothing forth, because 
it is no necessarie consequence, that those 
parts should alwaies remaine dry, since the Matrice 
retaineth onely that, which is fit for the conformation 
of the child. Likewise, if at the same time she 
hath a kind of yawning, and stretching, and feeles 
within her a shaking or quiuering (such as we commonly 
find presently vpon making of water) which 
runneth through the whole body, with a kind of 
chilnesse, and is felt chiefely betweene the shoulders 
and the backe, with some paine about the Nauell, 
and a rumbling or disquietnesse in the neather 
belly, which hapneth, because the Matrice shrinks 
[/8./] 
it selfe together, to entertaine and embrace the 
matter of generation which it hath drawne and 
suckt in, feeling thereby a kind of tickling. Againe, 
if within few dayes she falles a vomiting, and spitting, 
distasts her meate, groweth dull, carelesse, and 
[^p.5^] 
qualmish, longeth after strange things, finding 
her belly fallen, and growne flat, according to the 
French prouerbe. 
 
- Au ventre plat, enfant y a. 
In a belly which is flat, 
Ther's a child, be sure of that. 
 
Which makes them oftentimes to complaine and 
say they be quite fallen away. Then not long after 
her belly swells and growes bigger; her hips and 
raines are inlarged; her courses appeare not, which 
should flow at certain times, (although some haue 
[/9./] 
them whe~ they be with child.) Likewise if towards 
the second month her eyes grow hollow & wan, her 
eye-balls shew lesse: the lids be loose, limber, and 
soft: the veines in the corners of her eyes more 
[/10./] 
swollen, and bigger then ordinarie. For as H_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ppocrates 
saith, if thou canst not finde by any meanes whether 
a woman be with child, or no, her very eyes wil 
tell thee: for their eyes be more hollow, and sunke 
inward; and the white is turned bluish: the veines 
and arteryes of their neck are puft vp, and more apparent 
then vsually: their brests grow big, and hard, 
with some paine and pricking, hauing also milke 
within them: the nipple waxeth firme, and hard: 
red, if it be a boy; and sometime blackish, if it be a 
wench, which hapneth about the third or fourth 
moneth, when they begin to quicken. 
 
Some iudge of their being with child by the 
[/11./] 
vrine, as if it be white, and clearely mingled with 
little moates, and that at the top there is perceiued 
[^p.6^] 
as it were a little cloud like to the Rainebow; or of 
an Opall colour. At the bottome there appeares a 
certaine thicke sediment, which beeing shaken, 
spreads it selfe into little flocks, like to carded wooll. 
Towards the end, their vrine is thicke and reddish, 
by reason of the long retention of their naturall 
courses. 
 
[/12./] 
Fernelius makes this triall, which is, to take equall 
quantities of the womans vrine, and of white wine 
and to shake them well together, if this mixture 
looke like the broth of Beanes, it is a signe she is 
with child. 
 
[/13./] 
Hippocrates sets downe diuers experiments, as to 
giue the woman Hydromell to drinke made with 
raine water at night when she goes to bed, or else 
Hony and Annisseed beaten and dissolued in water. 
If she be with child, she will feele great paines 
and griping in her belly, (vnlesse she be vsed to 
[/14./] 
such kind of drinke, as Auicen saith.) Besides, if she 
receiue below any strong or stinking oder or smell, 
her clothes being well wrapped close about her, 
and the sent pierce not vp into her nose, she hath 
conceiued: As also, hauing ouer night put vp a 
cloue of Garlicke, if in the morning the sauour or 
taste come not into her mouth. 
 
[/15./] 
But these signes are not so certaine, the truest 
and surest are those which are collected from the 
child, when he begins to stirre and mooue, which 
commonly happens in the third and fourth moneth. 
This motion is very gentle, not vnlike the 
stirring of a flie when he flieth. 
 
[^p.7^] 
Another certaine signe may be perceiued by the 
[/16./] 
Midwife, who putting vp her finger into the wombe 
to touch the inner orifice thereof, if the woman be 
with child she shall finde it so close shut, that the 
point of a needle will scarse enter therein, yet soft, 
and without any hardnesse, which also will bee 
drawn vpward being shrunke and as it were trussed 
vp, because the body of the Matrice doth gather 
it selfe together to embrace the seed, which is the 
reason that the Midwife can very hardly come to 
reach it with her finger. 
 
Some women when they be with child hate the 
companie of their husbands: which quality is said 
also to be in brute beasts when they be great with 
yong, who commonly shun the company of the 
Male. And surely there be certaine times and seasons 
of the yeare proper for brute beasts to couple, 
but man (as Pliny saith) hath neither time nor season 
limited him, neither day nor howre appointed 
him, that so he might haue his desire at all times: 
which hath been thus ordained by nature, as being 
more fit, and necessary for man to multiplie in his 
kind he being (the liuely image of God, and made 
to behold his glory) then for brute beasts, which 
were created onely for the vse of man. 
 
I know well the answere that those two noble 
[/17./] 
Ladies, Poppea the daughter of Agrippina, and Iulia 
the daughter of Augustus made concerning this 
matter. The one sayd, that brute beasts cannot 
taste the delight which women receiue that are 
with child, because they are without reason: and 
[^p.8^] 
the other sayd, that when her ship was laden with 
wares, then she could take in passengers. 
 
[}The signes whereby to know whether a woman 
be with child of a boy or a wench. 
 
CHAP. II.}] 
 
HAuing shewne the meanes to know 
whether a woman be truely conceiued, 
it will not be from the purpose 
to handle this question for the satisfaction 
of some curious minds, who 
as soone as the Chirurgion hath giuen his censure 
that a woman is with child, demaunds presently of 
him whether it will be a boy, or a wench? But as it 
[/18./] 
is very hard to know at the first whether the woman 
be with child or no, so by great reason must it 
needs be farre more difficult to discerne, and distinguish 
the difference of the sexe, and to determine 
whether it will be a boy or a wench. 
 
I know there are some that boast they can certainely 
do it, but for the most part it hapneth rather 
by chance, then through either arte or skill. And 
for proofe thereof, I haue shewed them a child 
newly come from the mothers wombe, onely laying 
my hand vpon the priuie parts, yet durst they 
not be so bold as giue their opinion thereof, saying, 
that it were more easie to iudge of it when it was 
in the wombe, seeing that from thence might be 
gathered many euident signes: but wee must account 
the greatest part of them to be vncertaine, 
[^p.9^] 
as we haue formerly said. Neuerthelesse, to distinguish 
the Male from the Female, we will presently 
shew all the marks which we euer knew, or could 
obserue, either out of the ancient, or moderne 
writers. 
 
And first of all, yong women commonly are 
with child rather of a boy then of a wench, because 
they be hoter then the elder women, which was 
obserued by Aristotle, who saith farther, that if an 
[/19./] 
aged woman which neuer had children before, 
chance to conceiue, one may be sure it will be a 
wench. The like hapneth (as some write) to women, 
which conceiue when the winde is in the 
South, who for the most part bring forth daughters, 
and when the Northwind bloweth, sonnes. 
[/20./] 
 
Hippocrates saith, that a woman which goeth 
[/21./] 
with a boy hath a good colour, for a woman in her 
case, but if it be of a wench, she will haue a worse 
complexion. Likewise if the right breast be harder 
and firmer, the nipple hard, red, and more eminent, 
the milke white and thicke, which being milked 
or spirtled against a sleeke-stone, or some such 
smooth thing, continues in a round forme like a 
pearle, and being cast euen into water it dissolueth 
[/22./] 
not, but sinks directly to the bottome: and if you 
make a cake with the said milke and flower, and in 
the baking it continues firme, and close, it is a signe 
the woman is with child of a boy. Againe, she that 
goeth with a boy, hath the right side of her belly 
bigger, and more copped, and there the child 
stirreth oftenest. This motion commonly at sixe 
[^p.10^] 
weekes is scarse sensible, but at two months and a 
halfe more manifest. The Male child lyeth high aboue 
the Nauell by reason of his heate, and the Female 
at the bottome of the belly, because of her 
coldnes and weight. They which be with child of 
a boy are more quicke and nimble in all their actions, 
and be in better health of body, without being 
subiect to many infirmities, which commonly happen 
to women with child of a wench. 
 
[/23./] 
Auicen obserueth these signes, That a woman 
with child of a boy hath the pulse of her right side 
stronger, higher, and thicker, then that of the left: 
she will reach out her right hand rather then her 
left, and in going she wil alwayes set forth the right 
foote formost: her right brest is bigger then the 
left, and the right eye greater, brighter, and more 
sparkling: and if a woman about her last months 
haue any great sicknesse, or any throwes, without 
being deliuerd, it is some likelyhod that she is with 
child of a boy, since the male child is faster tied and 
bound then the female, because the ligaments 
which hold and fasten him are stronger and dryer 
then they that bind and support a wench. 
 
[/24./] 
A woman which is with child of a daughter hath 
a pale, heauy, and swarth countenance, a melancolique 
eye: she is wayward, fretfull, and sad: she 
[/25./] 
beares in her face as Hippocrates saith, Maculam solarem, 
that is to say, her face is spotted with red, like 
those who haue been much in the sunne: her left 
brest is bigger then the right; and the top of the 
nipple blacke. The milke which comes forth of her 
[^p.11^] 
brests is blewish, thin, and watrish: her belly is flat; 
and she feeles her burthen moue on the left side, 
and that, not before the fourth moneth: the veines 
of her thighes, and groine, are bigger, and more 
knottie on the left side then on the right. An honest 
[/26./] 
Gentlewoman assured me that she had made triall 
on this receipt, which is, to take an equall quantitie 
of Claret wine, and of vrine made in the morning, 
put them together into a glasse, and let them stand 
a whole day, if there appeare in the bottome a 
grosse cloud, thicke like to Beane-broth, it is a signe 
the woman is with child of a boy, if it appeare in 
the middest, it is signe of a wench, if there be nothing 
found in the bottome but the ordinary residence 
of vrine, it shewes she is not with child at all. 
 
An experiment likewise may be made out of the 
[/27./] 
practise of Liuia, the Mother of the Emperour Tiberius, 
who being with child, and desirous to know 
with what she went, tooke an egge from vnder a 
Henne that sate, and kept it warme so long in her 
hands, till at last a Cock-Chicken was hatched out 
of it, whereby she knew that she should haue a 
sonne, which proued to be Tyberius the Emperour, 
as Suetonius reporteth. 
 
Heere will it not be beside our purpose to set 
downe what Hippocrates writes in his booke de superfætatione, 
of the meanes how to get a man or 
[/28./] 
woman-child. He that wil (saith he) beget a sonne, 
must know his wife as soone as her courses are stayed, 
and then try the vtmost of his strength; but if 
he desire to get a daughter, then must he companie 
[^p.12^] 
with his wife a good while after her courses, 
or at that time when she hath them: and beside, 
he must tye his right stone as hard as he can endure 
it; and when he would haue a sonne, he must tye 
the left. But Aristotle seemes wrongfully to blame 
this worthie man, when he sayth, that the generation 
of Males or Females depends of the strength of 
the seed, and not of the stones, the vse whereof he 
saith, is not for generation. But experience teacheth 
vs the contrary, for the countreymen when 
they would haue a Bull beget a Cow-Calfe, or a 
Bull-Calfe, they tye the right stone for the one, and 
the left for the other. 
 
[}The signes whereby to know that a woman 
goeth with two children. 
 
CHAP. III.}] 
 
THe signes that a woman hath conceiued 
[/29./] 
two children, doe seldome appeare before 
the third or fourth moneth, which 
then is knowne, both by the mouing of 
the children, and also by the greatnes and swelling 
of the womans belly. As for the motion, if it be felt 
strong and forceable both on the right and the left 
side, at the same instant, then it is apparent, that 
there be two children. Likewise for the greatnes of 
her belly, if it appeare more swollen and bigger 
then in her other child-bearing, if the sides be higher 
then the middle of her belly, and from the nauell 
downeward there appeare as it were a line or separation 
[^p.13^] 
betweene both sides creasted; if the woman 
beare her burthen with difficultie, and her belly 
fall vpon her thighes and hips, then may you safely 
say that she goeth with two children. 
 
[}Of false Conception. CHAP. IIII.}] 
 
WOmen are oftentimes deceiued in 
reckoning themselues with child, for 
they thinke themselues with child 
when it is nothing but the stopping 
of their naturall sicknesse, which keepeth 
not due course. Some haue a false conception, 
which is as it were the beginning of Mola. 
Others haue the Mola it selfe, which we commonly 
call the Moone-calfe. 
 
False conception is a lump of flesh gathered together 
[/30./] 
commonly like to the gizard of a fowle, 
which is bigger or lesser according to the continuance 
of it, which nature commonly expelleth in 
the second, third, or fourth month. But the Mola is 
farre bigger, and continues a yeare or two, yea ten 
or twelue, and sometime as long as the woman 
liues. Of this Mola there be two kinds, the one may 
be called a true, the other a false one. The true Mola 
[/31./] 
is fleshy, being nothing else but an vnprofitable 
masse, without shape or forme, hard and firme, 
bred within the Matrice, and cleauing to the sides 
thereof. The false Mola is of three sorts, the one 
windy, being a collection of grosse winds: the second 
watrish, or a heaping together of waters: the 
[^p.14^] 
third humorall, or a meeting of many humors. All 
three contained within the capacitie of the womb, 
which doth make them differ from the swelling, 
hardnes, or Scyrehus of the said wombe, or from 
any flesh, water, or humor, which may chance to 
cleaue to, or touch the outward part thereof. 
[/32./] 
These are often bred together with the child, but 
then they cause death, either for that the child is 
deceiued of his nourishment which is carried to 
the Mola; or because he wanting roome, cannot 
grow and come to perfection. 
 
[/33./] 
Hippocrates saith, that there be some liuing and 
some dead Moles. The dead are like to the false 
burthens, so called, because women carry them 
not long, as being but lightly tyed and fastned to 
the sides of the Matrice. Sometime they are deuided 
into diuers seuerall pieces, so that Nicholas Nicolus 
saith, he saw a woman which cast forth nine 
of them in one day, the least whereof waighed 
foure pound. The quicke and liuing Moles are they 
which wholy cleaue to the wombe, and continue 
with the woman euen to her death. 
 
[/34./] 
The cause of the fleshy Mole according to the 
ancient writers cannot wholly proceede from the 
woman, but the man must adde somewhat thereunto. 
Galen holdeth, that it is bred when the mans 
seed is weake, barren, imperfect, or in little quantitie; 
and for the most part choked through the abundance 
of the menstruous bloud, which is grosse 
and thicke, vnfit for the framing of a child, so that 
in stead thereof is bread a lumpe of flesh that by 
[^p.15^] 
little and little increaseth, being wrapped in his 
owne membrane, which nature effecteth, as desirous 
to bring forth any thing rather then to be idle. 
 
The windie Mole is ingendred through want of 
[/35./] 
heate in the Matrice, and other parts adioyning, as 
the Liuer and Spleene, whereby much wind is 
bred and shut vp in the emptinesse of the wombe. 
It may also come from without, as in women newly 
deliuered, and in such which hauing had their 
naturall courses in great abundance, doe venture 
too soone into the cold aire. 
 
The watry Mole proceeds from the abundance 
[/36./] 
of watrie showres which is sent from the Liuer, or 
the Spleene, or other parts thereabouts; or else 
through the weakenes of the Matrice, which cannot 
assimilate the bloud that is brought to nourish 
it, part whereof is turned into water, and being not 
voided, stayeth in the wombe. 
 
The humorall Mole is bred by reason of too 
[/37./] 
much moisture, as of serious, or whayish humors, of 
the whites, or watrish euacuations, which come 
downe through the vessels of the Matrice, and are 
stayed in the concauitie thereof. 
 
False conception hath some common signes 
[/38./] 
with the true, as suppression of the naturall courses, 
depraued appetite, distastfulnesse, vomiting, swelling 
of the belly and breasts, so that it is very hard 
to distinguish the one from the other. But these 
[/39./] 
that follow are more proper to the false, then the 
true birth: for (as Hippocrates saith) In false conception, 
or Mola, the face is commonly puft vp, their 
[^p.16^] 
breasts which were swollen at the beginning, doe 
fall, and dayly wax soft, limber, and lanke, and without 
milke. In the end, the face, breasts, armes, 
thighes, and legs grow leane and thin: true it is, 
that they swell towards night, like those that haue 
the dropsie, the belly riseth and groweth quickly, 
and withall very hard, for the most part of an equall 
roundnesse, with diuers pricking paines in the bottome 
of the belly that neuer cease, which makes 
them that they can hardly walke, being hindred as 
it were with a heauie burthen, and hauing oftentimes 
a windinesse in the wombe, as Ahasis reporteth. 
 
[/40./] 
The said Hippocrates obserueth, how that by the 
motion it may easily be knowne, for in true conception 
the male child beginneth to stirre at the 
end of the third moneth, or sooner; and the female 
at the third or fourth moneth: and where there is 
no such quickning, we must obserue whether there 
be any milke in the brests, if there be none found, 
[/41./] 
it is a signe that it is a Mole. Beside, the mother feeleth 
the child moue euery way, both on the right 
side, and on the left, as much aboue, as below, and 
in the middle, without any helpe. But in false conception, 
though there be some motion, it is not animall, 
but proceedeth rather from the expulsiue 
facultie of the Mother then of the Mole, which hauing 
no liuing soule endeuoureth not of it selfe to 
come forth, neither prouoketh the wombe as the 
child doth, who hauing neede of aire to breath in, 
seekes after it. But this is a most euident signe when 
[^p.17^] 
the woman lyes downe on either side, for then she 
feeles it fall like a boule, and is not able to vphold, 
or stay it; yea, and being laid on her backe, if her 
belly be pressed or crushed, it will remaine in the 
place whither it is thrust, without comming backe 
[/42./] 
againe. Now that which most assureth vs, is, when 
the nine moneths are past, and the woman not deliuered, 
but her belly growes bigger, and swelleth 
more and more, and all the other parts grow leane 
and lesse, this is a sure signe of a Mole, though there 
be some women that haue borne their children 
ten, yea, eleuen moneths. 
 
The signes of the windy Mole are these, the belly 
[/43./] 
is equally swollen and stretched like a bladder, softer 
then in the fleshy Mole, and chiefely neere the 
groine and neather belly, which being struck vpon 
soundeth like a Tabour: sometime it decreaseth, 
and otherwhile it swelleth more: it is sooner bred 
and increased then the fleshy or watery, and stretches 
the belly as though it would teare it, which is 
not proper to the fleshy. 
 
As for the watery and humorall, the signes are 
[/44./] 
almost alike, the belly growes big, and riseth by 
little and little. If you touch it with your finger 
sometimes the print thereof will remaine behind: 
it is euen, without any hardnesse. It is true, that the 
woman lying on her backe, her flancks are fuller and 
bigger then the middle and bottome of the belly, 
which waxe flat, the water and humor running fro~ 
one side to the other; and in shaking the belly, they 
feele a swimming and floting of water. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[/45./] 
This difference may be also added, that in the 
the watrish the flancks, groine, and sometime the 
thighes are more distended and swollen then in the 
humorall, because the waterish substance stealeth 
thither soonest: besides, that which passeth forth 
and bloweth below is cleare like water, without 
any ill smell; but that which floweth in the humorall 
is reddish, and like to the washing of flesh, and 
of a bad sent. This also is to be obserued, that in 
the false conception the naturall courses flow not, 
and that the Nauell doth shew it selfe but little, or 
not at all, as it commonly doth when the Mother is 
with child. Concerning the cure thereof, I meane 
(god-willing) to handle it hereafter. 
 
[}What dyet and order a woman with child 
ought to keepe. 
 
CHAP. V.}] 
 
THat a woman with child may enioy her 
perfect health, she must diligently obserue 
that which consisteth in the vse of 
the sixe things not naturall, which are 
the Aire, Meate and Drinke, Exercise and Rest, 
Sleeping and Waking, Fulnesse and Emptinesse, 
and the Passions of the Minde. 
 
[/46./] 
First therefore she must dwell and liue in a good 
and well tempered Aire, which is neither too hote, 
nor too cold, or waterish: not subiect to any foggie 
mists, or winds, and especially the South-wind. For 
[^p.19^] 
(as Hippocrates saith) when those winds doe blow 
vpon euery light occasion, women miscarrie. The 
Northwind also is hurtfull vnto them, for those 
winds breed thin rheumes, distillations, & troublesome 
Coughs in great-bellyed women, causing 
[/47./] 
them oftentimes to abort, or be deliuered before 
their due time. Likewise such winds as bring with 
them ill smells and vapours, which being drawne in 
together with the Aire we breathe, into the Lungs, 
do many times breed very dangerous and troublesome 
diseases. Aristotle saith, that the smell of a 
[/48./] 
Candle put forth, may cause a woman to abort, or 
loose her fruite: wherefore she must beware of all 
ill Aire, and make her abode in houses well and 
pleasantly seated, shunning as much as may be possible 
all bad sauours. 
 
Concerning her Dyet, she must vse meates which 
[/49./] 
be of good nourishment, and breede good iuice, 
moderately drying. The quantitie must be sufficient 
both for her selfe, and for her child, and therefore 
they are to be dispenced withall from fasting 
at any time: for sometime too much abstinence 
makes the child weake and sickly, and causeth him 
often to be borne before his time, seeking after 
nourishment, which he cannot find within his Mothers 
body. As also the too great quantity of meate 
his Mother takes, may often stifle him, or else make 
[/50./] 
him grow so big, that he cannot keepe himselfe in 
his place, which constraines him either to come 
forth, or else makes him sickly, seeing that those 
meates are corrupted wherewith he is nourished 
[^p.20^] 
and fed. Hippocrates writeth in Epidem. that the 
Sister of Caius Duellius after she had eate her fill, 
aborted. 
 
All meates which are either too hote, cold, or 
too moist, are to be auoided, and chiefely in the beginning 
[/51./] 
of meales; as also those which are too salt, 
or ouer-much spiced; and likewise all baked meates 
are vtterly forbidden. Aristotle and Plinie write, 
that if a woman with child eate much salt meate, 
her childe will be borne without nayles; which 
shewes, that he will not be long liued. Her Bread 
must be of good Wheate, well kneaded, light, and 
also well baked. For her meate she may vse Henne, 
[/52./] 
Chicken, Capon, yong Pigeons, Turtle, Pheasants, 
Larks, Partridge, Veale, & Mutton: and for Herbs, 
[/53./] 
let her take Lettuse, Endiue, Borage, Buglosse, and 
Sorrell, abstaining from all raw Sallads. She may 
close her stomacke after meate with Peares, or 
Quinces bak't or preserued; as likewise with Cheries, 
or Damsons. She must shun all diureticall 
[/54./] 
things, which prouoketh either vrine, or the naturall 
courses, and such as are windie, as Pease and 
Beanes. Notwithstanding, women with child haue 
oftentimes such disordinate appetite, by reason of 
some salt or sharp humor which is contained within 
the membranes of the stomacke, that they desire 
to eate Coles, Chalke, Ashes, Waxe, Salt-fish raw, 
yea an vnwatred; and to drinke Veriuice, and Vineger, 
yea very dregs, so that it is impossible to hinder 
them from eating and tasting them. But yet 
they must refraine and ouer-maister themselues 
[^p.21^] 
therein as much as they can, since that such foode 
may much hurt and hinder both their owne and 
their childs health. Neuerthelesse if they cannot 
forbeare, suffer them a little, and let them haue 
their longings, for feare least it should proue worse 
[/55./] 
with them. For I haue seene many women which 
being hindered and forbidden fro~ vsing such trash, 
haue presently fallen into trauell: and in others, 
their children haue carried the marks of some of 
the things they so earnestly desired and longed after. 
Beside, although that such meates for the most 
[/56./] 
part are very bad and contrary, yet for the desire 
they haue to eate them they are digested commonly 
without hurting the partie at all. Meate 
and drinke (saith Hippocrates) is better and fitter, 
though it be some-what worse, then that which is 
better, and not so agreeable and pleasing. 
 
For her Drinke she may vse Claret wine, mature, 
[/57./] 
and not too strong, which she must allay very well. 
For this Wine hath power to comfort and strengthen 
the stomacke, and all the other parts seruing 
for nourishment and generation: and if she cannot 
away with Wine, let her drinke Hydromell, or Barley-water 
well boyled. 
 
Her sleepe must be in the night, the better to digest 
[/58./] 
the meate she hath taken: for watchings doe 
ingender crudities and diseases, which cause vntimely 
births in stead of faire and goodly children; 
and chiefely, she must auoid sleeping after dinner. 
But in the morning she may take her ease, as she 
shall thinke best, yet not turning (as some great Ladies 
[^p.22^] 
do) the day into night, and the night into day. 
 
[/59./] 
She may vse moderate exercise, but violent motion 
loosneth the Cotiledons or vessels of the Matrice 
whereby the child receiues his nourishment. 
They must be forbid riding in Waggins or Coaches, 
especially in the three first months: for as vpon 
a small occasion we see the fruits and flowers of 
trees do fall (as by some little wind that shakes the 
tree, or the like,) so many times through a light 
[/60./] 
cause women great with child, in stirring or moouing 
themselues, yea, or but setting their foot awry, 
may be deliuer'd before their time. 
 
It was not without good cause that the Romanes 
forbad their Wiues to ride in Coaches, the which 
also ought to be obserued in these dayes, especially 
by those who are subiect to take hurt, and therefore 
let them walke gently, taking an especiall heed 
and care to themselues the first three moneths. 
 
[/61./] 
She must shun all great noyse and sounds, as of 
Thunder, Artillery, and great Bells. Galen in his 
booke de Theriaca, sayth, that many women with 
child haue died with the very fright they receiued 
by a clap of thunder: and when she is afraid of hurting 
her selfe or falling into trauaile, let her be carried 
in a Chaire or Litter between two strong men, 
and chiefely two howres before meales: for as a 
woman may easily loose her burthen the first moneth, 
because her child (though he be but little) is 
not yet firmely fastned and tyed to the wombe, so 
likewise being great or big through his weight, he 
may fall downe, and come forth; wherefore all violent 
[^p.23^] 
exercise, and too much labour, is hurtfull and 
[/62./] 
dangerous for her; as also to fret, chide, or laugh 
immoderately. The fourth, fifth, and sixth moneth 
she may vse more libertie, the seuenth and eight 
she must keepe her selfe still and quiet, but when 
she is in her ninth moneth, then may she vse more 
stirring, and exercise. And therefore is it that Aristotle 
in his Politicks appointeth, that women with 
[/63./] 
child should not be sedentary, nor liue too nicely, 
but that since God hath blessed them to beare 
children, they should dayly visit the Temples of 
the Gods for their exercise. 
 
The which Plato expressely commandeth in his 
[/64./] 
Common-wealth, and by a kind of deuotion, and 
religious pietie. But Aristotle in that place speaketh 
like a Physition, as he sheweth in his booke de Generatione. 
In the Countrey (saith he) where women 
accustome themselues to labour, they are brought 
abed more easily, and with lesse paine. In briefe, 
where women exercise themselues, they are sooner 
[/65./] 
deliuered, for their exercise consumes the excrements, 
which idle and slothfull women gather and 
heape together. 
 
In the first foure moneths she must likewise abandon 
Venus for feare of shaking the child, and 
[/66./] 
bringing downe her courses, which must also be 
obserued in the sixth and eight moneth, but in the 
seuenth and ninth she may boldly vse it, especially 
toward the end of the ninth moneth, which some 
are of opinion will help and hasten the deliuery. 
 
Aristotle is of this opinion, (though herein he 
[^p.24^] 
[/67./] 
contradicts the authority of Hippocrates,) The woman 
with child (saith he) ought not to haue the 
company of her husband. But Aristotle and Hippocrates 
may easily be reconciled; the Philosopher 
meaneth, that they should not embrace their 
wiues all the time of their being with child, but 
onely toward the time of their lying in, thereby to 
shake the child, and make him come the more readily 
forth; for comming into the world after this 
acte, he is commonly enwrapped and compassed 
with slime, which helpeth his comming forth. 
 
[/68./] 
It is also requisite that her belly be loose, not retaining 
her excrements, and that she haue (if it be 
possible) euery day the benefit of Nature, which if 
it be not done naturally, it must be helpt, taking 
euery morning some broth of Damaske-Prunes; 
Also Apples stued with Suger, and a little Butter, is 
very fit and good. She may vse Broth wherein Borage, 
Buglosse, Purslane, Lettuse, Patience, and a 
little of the herbe Mercury hath beene boyled. She 
may likewise take Suppositaries so they be not too 
[/69./] 
sharpe. Clisters made of a Calues-head, or of a 
Sheepes-head, boyled with Annis-seed, and Fennil-seed, 
wherein some course Suger, and oyle of 
Violets is dissolued, are very conuenie~t, vsing them 
neuerthelesse with discretion, leauing out all manner 
[/70./] 
of ingredients which might cause a fluxe of the 
belly, for feare of Abortment, or being deliuered 
before their time, as Hippocrates saith. 
 
Notwithstanding the same Hippocrates is of opinion, 
[/71./] 
that women with child in cases of necessitie 
[^p.25^] 
may be purged from the fourth to the seuenth 
[/72./] 
moneth, but before and after those times he admits 
it not, nay, he forbids it directly; which for 
all that the Phisitions of our time obserue not in 
cases of danger, because the Medicines we vse in 
these dayes, as Rubarbe, Manna, Cassia, and Tamarinds, 
are not so violent as those that were vsed 
by our Ancients, which were Hellebor, Scammony, 
Turbith, Coloquintida, or the like: and wee 
must take especiall care of giuing them any opening 
[/73./] 
things which may either prouoke vrine, or 
their naturall courses; for as the same Author saith, 
It is impossible for the child to be healthfull if the 
mother haue her naturall sicknes. 
 
Bloud-letting is forbid them, vnlesse it be very 
needefull, especially if the child be growne any 
thing big, because he hath more neede of foode 
and nourishment, then at the beginning when he 
was little: for take away his sustenance, and he will 
waxe leane and feeble, being oftentimes driuen for 
want thereof to seeke a passage forth. Notwithstanding 
there are some women so sanguine and 
full of bloud that we are forced to take some of it 
away, least the child be stifled with the ouer-great 
quantitie thereof, or when they fall into diseases 
where it is necessary to open a veine. The fittest 
[/74./] 
time (if it be not in case of necessitie) is from the 
fourth, to the seuenth moneth. I haue seene a woman 
with child who for a Pleurisie was let bloud 
eleuen seuerall times, and yet stayed her full terme, 
and was well deliuered. 
 
[^p.26^] 
[/75./] 
Now concerning the passions of the minde, a 
woman with child must be pleasant and merrie, 
shunning all melancholike and troublesome things 
that may vexe or molest her mind: for as Aristotle 
saith, A woman with child must haue a setled and 
quiet mind, which Auicen also counselleth, that 
those which haue conceiued, ought to be preserued 
from all feare, sadnesse, and disquietnes of 
mind, without speaking or doing any thing that 
[/76./] 
may offend or vexe them; so that discreet women, 
and such as desire to haue children, will not giue 
eare vnto lamentable and fearefull tales or storyes, 
nor cast their eyes vpon pictures or persons which 
are vglie or deformed, least the imagination imprint 
on the child the similitude of the said person 
or picture, which doing, women shall be sure to be 
well and happily deliuered, and that (with the help 
of God) they shall beare their burthen to the full 
terme, which shall be sent into the world without 
much paine, promising them a happie and speedie 
deliuerie. To conclude, they must leaue off their 
Busks as soone as they perceiue themselues with 
child, not lacing themselues too straight, or crushing 
themselues together, for feare least the child 
[/77./] 
be mishapen and crooked, or haue not his naturall 
growth: and their garments must be rather light 
and thin, then heauie and cumbersome. 
 
[^p.27^] 
[}How a woman must gouerne her selfe the nine 
moneths she goeth with child. 
 
CHAP. VI.}] 
 
NOw I haue prescribed what manner 
of life a woman ought to leade, 
while she is with child: she may obserue 
(if it please her) this that followeth, 
though not so necessary, yet 
commodious and profitable both for the maintaining 
of her health, and preseruation of her beauty. 
To the end then that her breasts after her deliuery, 
be neither too big and puft vp, nor yet hanging 
[/78./] 
downe like bags, and to preuent the danger that 
might happen vnto her, by the too great quantity 
of bloud, that is turned into milke, (which may be 
curdled, and so suppurate, and putrifie.) As soone 
therefore as she knowes her selfe to be with child, 
(as in the second or third moneth) let her weare a 
chaine of gold about her necke. Some preferre a 
chaine of steele, or else a little gad of steele put betweene 
the two breasts, as likewise to put a piece 
of corke there, and to weare vnder her arme-pits 
two little pieces more of the same. This Fomentation 
also is very good. 
 
Take of Periwinckle, Sage, and ground-Iuy, of 
[/79./] 
each a handfull, Hemlocke halfe a small handfull, 
boyle them in wine and water, and when you haue 
taken it from the fire put thereto a little rose-vineger. 
And with this decoction warme, bath your 
[^p.28^] 
breasts in the morning with a cloth or spung dipt 
therein, a quarter of an houre, wiping and drying 
them afterwards with reasonable warme clothes. 
The like may be done with the waters of the same 
[/80./] 
hearbs, and about the third or fourth moneth, when 
she feeles her selfe quicke, about which time her 
belly begins to swell and grow big, she must weare 
a Swathe (made fit for the purpose) to support her 
belly, being first annointed with this Liniment or 
Pomade, which she shall continue till the ninth 
moneth, to keepe her belly from being full of knottie 
and broken vaines, furrow'd and wrinckled, making 
it grow deformed, vnseemely, and hanging 
downe lower then is fit, which hapneth by reason 
of the great burthen and weight of the child, that 
stretcheth and inlargeth the skinne thereof, and 
causeth them to indure great paine in their belly 
and groine. 
 
[/81./] 
Take of Kids sewet, and the fat of a Sow, of each 
three ounces, of Capons and Goose-grease, of each 
an ounce and halfe, cut them small, and melt them 
in an earthen pot, putting thereto as much water 
as will suffise, then straine them through a cloth, 
and wash them in water till they waxe very white, 
and haue lost their sauour. Afterward melt them 
againe in a double vessell, adding thereto an ounce 
of the marrow of a Hart, or Stag, then wash it againe 
with Rose-water, or other sweet smelling water, 
mingling therewithall (if you thinke fit, or that 
it will not be hurtfull to the wombe) two or three 
graines of Muske or Ciuet. 
 
[^p.29^] 
Some vse this oyntment: Take dogs grease, and 
[/82./] 
the fat about a sheepes kidney, of each two ounces, 
Spermaceti one ounce, oyle of sweet Almonds 
an ounce and a halfe, the fats must be melted, prepared, 
and washed as before, then melted againe 
with the rest, and washed with rose or sweet water. 
 
Some take good store of Sheepes-feet well brused 
and broken in pieces, to the number of thirty or 
forty, and boyle them well in water, then taking off 
the fat, and marrow that swimmeth on the top, 
which they wash well in common water, and take 
therof two ounces, of Ducks-grease as much, Spermaceti 
[/83./] 
one ounce, white Waxe sixe drams, melt 
them altogether in a double vessel, and wash them 
in the aboue named waters. 
 
Some Ladyes and Gentlewomen which loue not 
to rub their bellies euery morning with any of these 
liniments, weare thereon a Dog-skin, or some other 
wel prepared and dressed, as followeth; and change 
it euery fifteene dayes, or according as it will last 
and continue, not taking it off, except it shriuell 
and grow wrinckled. 
 
Take a Dog-skin, or some other skin ready dressed 
to make gloues of, wash it often in common 
water, afterward in Rose-water, and dry it in the 
shade, and being thus drest and dryed, lay it in soke 
in these oyles and fats following: 
 
Take of Mesues oyntment of Roses an ounce and 
halfe, oyle of Saint Iohns wort, and of sweet Almonds, 
[/84./] 
of each an ounce, fresh Butter, and Spermaceti, 
of each halfe an ounce, melt all these together 
[^p.30^] 
in a double vessell, and let the skin lie and soke 
in it, three or foure daies, mouing & stirring them 
together daily: then take it foorth, and spred it in 
the aire, and let it lie there two or three daies till it 
haue sok't in all the oile, & become drie: then cut it 
to the forme & bignesse of the belly, and so apply it. 
 
The daintie and curious may vse the former 
liniments and skin: they that haue not the meanes 
[/85./] 
to do either, let them; Take of fresh Butter well 
wash't in common water, and then in Rose-water, 
three ounces, oile of sweet Almonds, one ounce, 
Spermaceti, halfe an ounce: and with these melted 
together, rub their belly. 
 
[/86./] 
These Ointments must be kept in a gally pot, and 
couered with Rose water to keepe them from being 
mustie. 
 
[/87./] 
When the Woman is come to the ninth Moneth, 
hauing been in good health all the time of 
her going with child: she must continue the vse of 
the aforesaid Ointments, and must begin to vse 
more exercise then she did before, walking gently 
before meales the first twelue or fifteene daies: and 
then afterward it will be good to vse stronger exercise. 
 
It will be very profitable for her (especially after 
the ten or twelue first daies of the ninth moneth 
be past) to sit in the decoction following, after the 
maner of a halfe Bath, some quarter, or halfe an 
hower in the morning, and then being well dried, 
and laid to bed, let her be annointed behind, all 
along the lower part of her backe, and before, from 
[^p.31^] 
the Nauill downward; and chiefly vpon Os Pubis, 
and the groine, with the ointment following. 
 
Take of Mallowes Althæa, with their roots, Motherwort, 
[/88./] 
of each two handfull, white Lilly roots, 
three ounces, Chamomill, and Melilot flowers, of 
each a good handfull, Lin-seed, Quince-seed, and 
Foenigreeke, of each an ounce: Boyle them all in 
sufficient quantitie of running water, for the Bath. 
 
Take of Hens fat, three ounces, Duckes fat, an 
[/89./] 
ounce and a halfe, fresh Butter, two ounces, Linseed 
oile, an ounce and a halfe: Melt them all together, 
then wash them verie well in Parietarie, 
and Mugwort water, adding thereto two ounces of 
the Muccilage of Althæa Roots. In which space, let 
her take this drinke euery morning fasting. Take of 
[/90./] 
Oile of sweet Almonds newly drawen without fire, 
an ounce, white Wine, halfe an ounce, Parietarie 
water, one ounce, mingle them together. Some 
haue found good by taking the yelke of an Egge, 
and drinking a draught of Hypocras after it. 
 
Others take a little Wine and water, wherein 
Lin-seed hath been stieped. 
 
Let this or the like order and gouernment be obserued, 
for a Woman that is of a good habit of body, 
and who in her going with Child, hath not been 
subiect to any sicknesse, or accident of moment: 
bearing her Children well, & without much paine. 
 
But because there be many, which are troubled 
with diuers accidents, which happen in their Child-bearing, 
I thought good heere, to treat thereof 
briefly, before I speake of their Deliuerie. 
 
[^p.32^] 
[}Of many infirmities, which trouble Women while 
they are great with Child. 
 
CHAP. VII.}] 
 
[/91./] 
IT becomes a Woman well at all times, 
and chiefly in her Child-bearing, and after 
her Deliuerie, to haue a care, as 
much as she can possiblie, of the preseruation 
of her Beautie: since there is nothing that 
sooner decaies and spoileth it, then the often bearing 
[/92./] 
of Children. But as Health is more precious, 
and recommendable then Beautie: and seeing that 
a woman with Child may be troubled and oppressed 
with many accidents, and infirmities, during the 
nine Moneths she beares her child: it will be therefore 
verie necessary and profitable to seeke out the 
meanes to free and deliuer them thereof: For in 
loosing the Mother, the life of the Child is also hazarded. 
[/93./] 
Aristotle in his booke De generatione Animalium, 
is of opinion, That bruit beastes going 
with young, are not subiect to any diseases: and 
contrariwise, that Women are verie often sicke. 
[/94./] 
Hippocrates saith, That they be pale and wan, to 
shew that they are subiect to many infirmities. In 
times past when men and women were sold like 
slaues, if there were any found that were with child, 
she was not warranted for whole and sound by him 
[/95./] 
that sold her, as Vitruuius writes in his second book; 
because they were troubled and subiect to so many 
[^p.33^] 
diseases. In the first three or foure Moneths such infirmities 
chiefly happen for many causes. First, because 
[/96./] 
they liue (as Aristotle saith) for the most part 
in idlenesse, and eate ill meates; which are turned 
into excrements, and breed many obstructions, the 
fountaine and beginning of all diseases: the second 
is, the great suppression and stopping of bloud, 
whereof they were wont to be purged euery Moneth, 
before their being with Child; which runs to 
the Matrice to be voided, & find that accustomed 
passage; which it had woont to haue: but being not 
able to get forth, and much lesse to be spent and digested, 
by the Child (which is as yet but little) it returnes 
backe into the vaines, & chiefly those which 
are neere the stomacke: and through the long continuance, 
is there corrupted, and changed, to be of 
a bad qualitie, whereof proceeds this depraued and 
disordinate appetite, which the Latins call Pica, or 
Malacia: Loathing of meat, Hicket, Vomiting, 
[/97./] 
Paines of the stomacke, Flanckes, and Belly, Ache 
of the backe, Hips, and Groine, difficultie of making 
water, Panting, and beating of the heart, with 
Sounning, the Cough, binding and Fluxe of the 
belly, swelling of the Thighs, and Feet, and sometimes 
Abortment, not being able to beare their 
Children the full time: together with many other 
accidents; whereof we will speake hereafter, beginning 
with the Pica, which troubleth them oftnest, 
and longest. 
 
[^p.34^] 
[}Of the disordinate longing called Pica. 
 
CHAP. VIII.}] 
 
WEe commonly say the appetite is depraued, 
when beyond measure we 
couet to eate and drinke too much 
(in respect of what hunger naturally 
requireth:) Or when we desire, or 
long after meats, which are vnusuall, and offend 
in qualitie, and are not drest and prepared as they 
ought. 
 
Of this depraued Appetite there be diuers sorts. 
[/98./] 
The first is called Boulimos of the Greeks, and of the 
Latins, Fames vaccina, & appete~tia immodica. When 
they eate more then is requisite, not being able to 
satisfie themselues. And if hunger vrge them farther, 
and grow greater, then it is called of the Latins 
[/99./] 
Appetitus caninus, or Fames insatiabilis, and the 
partie eates, till he be full, euen to the throat, that 
he is constrained to vomit, his stomacke being so 
ouercharged. But then presently he is driuen to eat 
againe, and then to vomit: from whence the Prouerbe 
is taken; He is returned like a Dog, to his vomit. 
The like hapneth for drinking, as for eating, 
[/100./] 
which the Latins call Sitis immodica, which is so 
great, that the tongue cleaues to the roofe of the 
mouth, not being able to eate or speake except the 
mouth be first moistned, and the tongue wetted. 
This accident is verie hard, yea, euen vnsupportable 
[^p.35^] 
to endure, the sicke party taking no other delight 
but in drinking, and that often, and in great 
draughts. Men are more subiect to this drougth 
then women: Contrariwise, Women, and chiefly 
those with child, & such as haue not their Courses, 
or Wenches that are subiect to the Greene sicknesse, 
are more troubled with this depraued or immoderate 
appetite, called Malacia, or Pica; hauing 
this name giuen it, either because Pyes are troubled 
[/101./] 
with this disease, or else for that their feathers 
be of diuers colours, blacke and white, according 
to the varietie of things, which Women long after. 
This sicknesse hapneth when they desire to eate or 
drinke things, that are wholie contrarie to Nature, 
as eating of raw or burnt flesh, yea, euen to long 
after Mans flesh, Ashes, Coles, old Shoes, Chalke, 
Waxe, Nutshels, Morter, and Lime: as Fernelius 
[/102./] 
witnesseth of a man, who being a long time desirous 
to eat vnslak't lime, at last deuoured thereof 
the bignesse of ones fist; which helpt him, without 
doing him any harme, either in the stomacke, or 
guts. Notwithstanding, not long since, the daughter 
of M. Forges died, with eating the plastering 
of wals. 
 
Sometimes custome, which is a second Nature, 
makes vs couet to eat such contrarie things, as we 
desire, and the rather because we haue commonly 
eaten thereof in our youth: There is found the contrarie 
hereof in some, who abhor and loath good 
meates, which is imputed to the Idiosyncrasie or 
particular constitution of the person. Others haue 
[^p.36^] 
obserued, that there are such malignant humours 
sometimes bred in vs, that they are turned into poison, 
and make both these depraued appetites. As it 
is seen by poisons taken inwardly, and applied outwardly, 
which make the like effect. The biting of 
the serpent Dipsas doth testifie the same, which 
breedeth an intollerable and vnquenchable thirst 
in him that hath been wounded by it. 
 
Now therefore, leauing all these kinds of vitiated 
and depraued Appetites, we will onely speake 
of that wherewith great-bellied Women are troubled, 
which is called Pica. 
 
[/103./] 
Some impute the cause of this sicknesse to certaine 
Crudities, and ill humours, which are contained 
in the whole habite of the bodie, and imparted 
to the mouth, or orifice of the stomacke. But the 
soundest opinion is, that the sides and tunicles of 
the stomacke, and orifice thereof, are infected, and 
stuffed with diuers excrements, and ill humours; 
and according to the qualitie they haue, the Woman 
[/104./] 
with child, longeth after the like: As if Melancholie 
abound, not burn't or adust; she longeth 
after sharpe things, as Vineger, Citrons, and Orenges: 
if the Melancholie be adust, shee desireth 
Coles, Ashes, and Plastering: if the humour be 
salt, she coueteth salt meates, and so of the rest. 
And surely it often happens, that they long for the 
like things as are in their stomackes. This maligne 
and bad humour, is ingendred (as we haue said) 
through the retention of the naturall Courses in 
women with Child, which flow backe into the stomacke. 
[^p.37^] 
In some it beginneth the first weeks, yea, 
[/105./] 
the verie first day; in others the thirtieth or fortieth 
day, and continues euen till the fourth moneth, and 
then ceaseth: which commeth so to passe, because 
the Child is growen bigger, and hauing need of 
more Nourishment, draw's to him a greater quantitie 
of bloud; the which he consumes: and so by 
consequent, it returnes backe no more into the stomacke. 
Besides also, this humour hath been much 
spent, and voided, by the often vomitings which 
Women haue during the first moneths. And also 
because the Childs haire is bred, and grown great, 
[/106./] 
which some hold to be partly a cause of this sicknesse. 
Plinie writes, That women with Child, feel 
themselues worse, when their Childs haire begins 
to come, and chiefly about the new of the Moone. 
 
Now that we may preserue them from this infirmitie, 
or at least diminish it as much as may bee: 
[/107./] 
she must chiefely vse meats that breed good iuice; 
and that in little quantitie, increasing it neuerthelesse 
as her bignesse augmenteth, and the childe 
groweth: which at length waxing stronger and 
greater, will consume part of this great quantitie 
of bloud, and the rest may bee put into the 
membranes which wrap and infold the childe, and 
to the masse of bloud which is called the after-burthen, 
which is as it were the liuer of the Matrice. 
 
Now concerning their meat and drinke: Considering 
that they that are sicke of this disease, and so 
infinitely distasted, that often times they doe euen 
loath and abhorre good meats: therefore wee must 
[^p.38^] 
[/108./] 
set an edge (as it were) on their appetite, varying 
their meats in as many fashions as may be possible, 
thereby to make them the more pleasing and desireable. 
 
Oliues and Capers, as likewise sallades a little 
parboiled, are very good for them. 
 
All meats that are either too fat, or too sweet, 
bee naught, because they stirre vp a desire of vomiting. 
 
For their sauces: they may vse Veriuice, Orringes, 
Citrons, Pomegranats, and good Rose viniger, 
all very moderately taken. 
 
[/109./] 
Auicen commendeth tosted cheese, and Amylum 
[/110./] 
dried: which Aetius and Oribasius doe allow, 
and especially to those that desire to eat earth, and 
[/111./] 
plastering of walles, or the like. Paulus Aegineta allowes 
them the vse of mustard, pepper, and cloues 
to make sauce thereof, for the stirring vp of their appetite, 
and to helpe to digest the crudities contained 
within the stomacke: after meales she may eat 
bak't quinces, and rosted filberds. For her drinke, 
she must vse good clarret wine, well allaied: but if 
shee long for white, you may giue her leaue to 
drinke some, so that it haue a little astriction. 
 
[/112./] 
True it is, that the ouergreat quantitie of drinke 
is hurtfull for her, by reason of the great washing 
which it might make in her stomacke: shee may 
take euery morning a draught of Wormewood-wine, 
or a little strong Hydromel, with a tost of 
bread. The vse of these Lozenges is much commended.

The Ancients, as Paulus and Oribasius, exceedingly 
commend the decoction of Polypody, and 
Annis-seed, with suger of Roses. They may vse 
gentle fomentations to their stomackes, made of 
Wormewood, Balaustia, Cumin, Cytisus, and 
Fennill-seed, wherewith likewise may be made Cataplasmes 
for the same vse. For these medicines 
will comfort and strengthen the concoctiue facultie 
of the stomacke, the better to digest the meat; 
the retentiue, to retaine and keepe that it hath receiued; 
the expulsiue, to thrust that foorth which 
troubleth the stomacke; and the appetite, to couet 
and long for meat. 
 
This ointment is also very fit and profitable.

[^p.40^] 
They may vse Galens Cerote for the stomacke, 
or that of Aecius, made with Quinces, Saffron, and 
a little oile of Spicknard. 
 
Concerning generall purgations, which may euacuate 
downeward part of this superfluitie, they 
must not be administred when a woman is yoong 
[/117./] 
with childe, but with very great care, and good aduice, 
not vsing any strong purgers. But if there bee 
need, and that the disease ceaseth not by light medicines, 
then may be giuen a little infusion of Rubarbe, 
and a gentle decoction of Sene, taking the 
aduice of the learned Physitian. And therefore we 
must onely haue a regard to their vomiting, which 
at these times doth commonly molest and trouble 
them: taking heed of staying it, except it be immoderate 
[/118./] 
(as Auicen saith) or too violent. For otherwaies 
it helpeth to cure this disease, euacuating 
part of those ill humours whereby it is nourished 
and increased. And if wee perceiue she hath a desire 
to vomit, and that the expulsiue facultie be not 
strong enough to helpe it, let her take a little Hydromell 
warme; and if the matter in the stomacke 
be tough and clammie, adde thereto a little vineger, 
the better to attenuate, and cut it. I haue 
beene the longer in this Chapter, because it is an 
accident that doth much annoy women with 
childe: thereby the better to instruct the yoong 
Chirurgion, when there is no Physitian neere at 
hand.
