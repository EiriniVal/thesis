[}An Introduction. 
 
CHAP. I.}] 
 
IF any one, but of 
a meane capacity 
were asked what 
were the wonder of the 
world; I thinke that reason 
would move him to answer, 
[^p.2^] 
Man; he being the [/1./] [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
or little world, to whom 
all things are subordinate: 
agreeing in the Genus with 
things sensitive, all being 
Animal, but differing in the 
Species, for man alone is endued 
with reason; Let us 
[/2./] 
make man in our image, after 
our likenesse. Wherefore 
of the Greeks hee is called 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], of turning 
his eyes upward towards 
him, whose image and 
superscription hee beares: 
whence the Poet writeth; 
[/3./] 
Nonne vides hominum, ut colsos? 
ad sidera vultus 
Sustulerit Deus? ac sublimia 
finxerit? ora. 
See how the heavens high Architect 
hath fram'd man in this wise; 
To stand, to goe, to looke erect, 
with body, face, and eyes. 
[^p.3^] 
And Cicero saith, that all creatures 
[/4./] 
were made like Moles, 
to root upon the earth, man 
onely excepted; to him was 
given an upright frame, to 
behold that mansion prepared 
for him above. 
 
Now to the end that this 
so noble and glorious a creature 
might not quite perish, 
hath the Almighty given 
unto woman the field of generation 
for a receptacle of 
humane seed; whereby that 
naturall and vegitable soule 
which lies potentially in the 
seed, may, by the Vis plastica, 
bee produced into act; that 
man being mortall, and leaving 
his off-spring behinde 
him, may become as it were 
immortall, and live in his 
posterity. 
 
And because this field of 
[^p.4^] 
generation, to wit, the 
wombe, is the subject-matter 
from whence our ensuing 
discourse is drawne, like 
so many lines from the center; 
that you may the better 
judge of that which followes, 
wee will in briefe lay 
before you the parts of the 
wombe, together with the 
qualities of the menstruous 
bloud. 
 
First, touching the womb; 
[/5./] 
of the Grecians it is called 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] the mother; or [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
saith Priscian, because it 
makes us all brothers. 
 
It is placed in the Hypogastrium, 
or lower part of the 
belly, in the cavity called 
Pelvis having the [/6./] streight 
gut on one side, to keepe it 
from the hardnesse of the 
back-bone, and the bladder 
[^p.5^] 
on the other side, to defend 
it from blowes. The forme 
or figure of it is like a [/7./] virill 
member, onely this excepted, 
the manhood is outward, 
and the womanhood 
within. 
 
It is divided into the necke 
and the body. The necke 
[/8./] 
consists of a hard fleshie substance 
much like a [/9./] cartilage: 
at the end whereof there is 
a membrane transversly place, 
called Hymen, or Eugion. 
[/10./] 
Neere also unto the necke 
[/11./] 
there is prominent panicle, 
which is called of Montanus, 
the doore of the wombe, because 
it preserveth the matrice 
from cold and dust. Of 
the Grecians it is called 
[^GREEK OMITTED^]; of the Latines Præputium 
muliebre, because the 
Jewish women did abuse 
[^p.6^] 
this part to their owne mutuall 
lust, as Saint Paul speaks, 
[/12./] 
for which Iuvenal turns Satyrist 
against them. 
 
Nec distare putant humana carne 
suillam, 
Que pater abstinuit mox et præputia 
ponunt. 
 
The bodie of the wombe 
[/13./] 
is that wherein the childe 
is conceived, and this is not 
altogether round, but dilates 
it selfe into two angles, 
which Herophilus comparing 
to the hornes of a calfe, 
calleth them [^GREEK OMITTED^]. 
The outward part of it is nervous, 
and ful of sinewes, which are 
the cause of its motion: but 
inwardly it is fleshie. 
 
It is fabulously reported, 
that in the cavity of the 
wombe there are seven divided 
[^p.7^] 
cels or receptacles for 
humane seed. But those that 
have seene Anatomies, doe 
know there are but two, and 
those not divided by a partition, 
but onely by a line or 
suture running throgh the 
middest of it. In the right 
side of the cavity, by reason 
of the heat of the Liver, 
[/14./] males are conceived. In the 
left side, by the coldnesse of 
the Spleene, females are begotten. 
And this doe most 
of our Modernes hold for 
[/15./] 
an infallible truth, yet Hyppocrates 
holds it but in the 
generall; for in whom (saith 
he) the spermaticall vessell 
of the right side comes from 
the reines, and the spermaticall 
vessell of the left side 
from the hollow veine, in 
them males are conceived in 
[^p.8^] 
the left side, and females in 
the right. Well therefore 
may I conclude with the 
saying of Empedocles. Such 
[/16./] 
sometimes is the power of 
the seed, that a male may be 
conceived in the left side, as 
well as in the right. In the 
bottome of the cavity there 
[/17./] 
are little holes, called the 
Cotyledones, which are the 
ends of certaine veines and 
arteries, serving, in breeding 
women, to conveigh sustenance 
to the childe, which is 
received by the Vmbilicall 
veine: And in others to carry 
the cources into matrice. 
 
Now, touching the menstruals: 
[/18./] 
They are defined to 
bee a monethly flux of excrementitious 
and unprofitable 
bloud. 
 
In which we are to note, 
[^p.9^] 
that the matter flowing 
forth is excrementitious; 
[/19./] 
which is to be understood of 
the superplus or redundancie 
of it:for it is a excrement 
in quantity, in quality being 
pure and incorrupt, like unto 
the bloud in theveines. 
 
And that the menstruous 
bloud is pure, and simply of 
it selfe, all one in quality 
with that in the veines, is 
proved two wayes: First, 
[/20./] 
from the the finall cause of 
this bloud, which is the propagation 
and conservation 
of mankinde; that man 
might bee conceived; and 
being begotten, hee might 
bee comforted and preserved, 
both in the wombe,and 
out of the wombe. And all 
will grant it for a truth, that 
the childe, while it is in the 
[^p.10^] 
matrice is nourished with 
this bloud; and it is as true, 
that being out of the womb, 
it is still nourished with the 
same; for the [/21./] milke is nothing 
but the menstruous 
bloud made white in the 
breasts; and I am sure womans 
milke is not thought 
to bee venomous, but 
of a nutritive quality, answerable 
to the tender nature 
of an infant. Secondly, 
it is proved to be pure from 
the generation of it, it being 
the superfluity of the 
last aliment of the fleshie 
parts. 
 
It may be objected, if the 
bloud bee not of a hurtfull 
quality, how can it cause 
such [/22./] venomous effects; as 
if the same fall upon trees 
and herbs, it maketh the one 
[^p.11^] 
barren, and mortifies the other. 
And Averroes writes, 
[/23./] 
that if a man accompany 
with a menstruous woman, if 
she conceive, she shall bring 
forth a Lepar. I answer, 
[/24./] 
this malignity is contracted 
in the wombe; for the woman 
wanting native heat to 
digest this superfluity, sends 
it to the matrice, where seating 
it selfe untill the mouth 
of the wombe be dilated, it 
becomes corrupt and venomous, 
which may easily be, 
considering the heat and 
moistnesse of the place. This 
bloud therefore being out of 
his vessels, offends in quality; 
In this sense let us understand 
Pliny, Fernelius, Florus, 
and the rest of that torrent. 
[/25./] But if frigidity bee the 
cause why women cannot 
[^p.12^] 
digest all their last nourishment, 
and consequently that 
they have these purgations: 
It remaines to give a reason 
why they are of so cold a 
constitution more than 
men; which is this: The 
[/26./] 
naturall end of mans and 
womans being, is to propagate; 
and this iniunction 
was imposed upon them by 
God at their first creation, 
and againe after the deluge: 
now in the act of conception 
there must be an [/27./] Agent 
and a Patient, for if they be 
both every way of one constitution, 
they [/28./] cannot propagate; 
man therefore is 
hot and dry; woman cold 
and moist: he is the [/29./] Agent, 
she the [/30./] Patient, or weaker 
vessell, that she should [/31./] be 
subject unto the office of the 
[^p.13^] 
Man. It is necessary likewise 
that woman should be of a 
cold constitution, because in 
her is required a redundancy 
of matter for the infant depending 
on her; for otherwise, 
if there were not a superplus 
of nourishment for 
the child, more than is convenient for 
the mother, then 
would the infant detract 
and weaken the principall 
parts of the mother; and 
like unto the Viper, the generation 
of the infant would 
be the destruction of the 
parent. These monethly 
[/32./] 
purgations continue from 
the 15. yeare, to the 46. or 
50. Yet often there happens 
a suppression, which is either 
naturall, or morbifficall. 
They are naturally supprest 
in breeding women, and 
[^p.14^] 
such as give sucke. The morbificall 
suppression fals now 
into our method to bee 
spoken off. 
 
CHAP. II. 
[}Of the retention of the months.}] 
 
[/33./] 
THe suppression of the 
Termes is an interception 
of that accustomary 
evacuation of bloud, which 
every moneth should come 
from the matrice, proceeding 
from the instrument or 
matter vitiated. The part 
affected is the wombe, and 
that of it selfe, or by consent. 
 
[}Cause.}] 
 
The cause of this suppression 
is either externall or internall. 
[^p.15^] 
The externall cause 
may bee heat or drinesse of 
the aire, immoderate watching, 
great labour, vehement 
motion, and the like, whereby 
the matter is so consumed, 
and the body so exhaust, 
that there is not a superplus 
remaining to be expelled; 
as is recorded of 
the [/34./] Amozonites, who being 
active, and alwayes in 
motion, had their fluxions 
very little, or not at all. Or 
it may bee caused by cold, 
which is most frequent, making 
the bloud viscuous and 
grosse, condensing and binding 
up the passages, that it 
cannot flow forth. 
 
The internall cause is either 
instrumentall or materiall, 
in the wombe or in the 
bloud. 
 
[^p.16^] [^Original misnumbered as p.17.^] 
 
In the wombe it may bee 
divers wayes; by Apostoms, 
Tumors, Ulcers, by the narrownesse 
of the veines and 
passages; or by the [/35./] Omentum 
or kell in fat bodies, 
pressing the necke of the 
matrice: but then they 
must have Hernia Zirbalis: 
for in mankinde the kell reacheth 
not so low. By overmuch 
cold or heat, the one 
vitiating the action, and the 
other consuming the matter. 
By an evill composition 
of the uterine parts; by the 
[/36./] necke of the wombe being 
turned aside; and sometimes, 
though rarely, by a 
[/37./] membrane or excrescence 
of flesh growing about the 
mouth or necke of the 
wombe. The bloud may bee 
in fault two wayes, in quantity 
[^p.17^] 
or in quality. In quantitity, 
when it is so consumed, 
that there is not a superplus 
left, as in Viragoes and virill 
[/38./] 
women, who through their 
heat and strength of nature, 
digest and consume all their 
last nourishment; as Hippocrates 
writes of Phaetusa, who 
[/39./] 
being exiled by her husband 
Pythea, her termes were supprest, 
her voyce changed, 
andhad a beard, with a countenance 
like a man.But these 
I judge rather to be Anthropophagæ, 
women-eaters, than 
women-breeders, because 
they consume one of the 
principles of generation, 
which gives a being to the 
world, viz. the menstruous 
bloud. The bloud likewise 
may be consumed, and 
consequently, the termes 
[^p.18^] 
stayed by bleeding of the 
nose; by a flux of the Emroides; 
by a Dysenteria, 
commonly called the bloudy 
flux, by many other evacuations, 
and continuall and 
chronicall diseases. Secondly, 
the matter may bee vitious 
in quality; as suppose it 
bee sanguineons, flegmaticall; 
bilious, or melancholious, 
every one of these, if 
they offend in grosnesse, will 
cause an obstruction in the 
veynes. 
 
[}Signes.}] 
 
Signes manifesting the disease, 
are paines in the head, 
necke, backe, and loynes; 
wearinesse of the whole body, 
but especially of the 
hips and legges, by reason 
of a confinity which the matrix 
[^p.19^] 
hath with these parts: 
trembling of the heart. Particular 
signes are these; if 
the suppression proceeds of 
cold, she is heavie, sluggish, 
of a pale colour, and hath a 
slow pulse, Venus combates 
are neglected, the urine is 
crude, watrish, and much in 
quantity; the excrements of 
the guts usually are retained. 
If of heat, the signes are 
contrary to those even now 
recited. If the retention be 
naturall, and come of conception; 
this may be known 
[/40./] 
by drinking of Hydromell, 
that is water and honey, after 
supper going to bed, and 
by the effect which it worketh; 
for, after the taking of 
it, if shee feeles a beating 
paine about the navell and 
lower parts of the belly, it 
[^p.20^] 
is a signe she hath conceived, 
and that the suppression is 
naturall: If not, that is it vitious, 
and ought medicinally 
to be taken away. 
 
[}Prognosticks.}] 
 
With the evill quality of 
the wombe the whole body 
stands charged; but especially 
the Heart, the Liver, 
and the Braine; and betwixt 
the wombe and these 
three principall parts, there 
is a singular consent. 
 
First, the wombe communicates 
to the heart by the 
mediation of those Arteries 
which come from Aorta; 
hence the termes being supprest, 
will ensue faintings, 
swoonings, intermission of 
pulse, cessation of breath. 
 
Secondly, it communicates 
[^p.21^] 
to the Liver by the 
veines derived from the 
hollow veine; hence will 
follow obstructions, cachexies, 
jaundise, dropsies, hardnesse 
of the spleene. 
 
Thirdly, it communicates 
unto the braine, by the 
nerves and membranes of 
the backe; hence will arise 
Epilepsies, Apoplexies, 
Frensies, melancholy passions, 
paine in the after parts 
of the head, fearfulnesse, inability 
of speaking. Well 
therefore may I conclude 
with Hyppocrates, if the moneths 
[/41./] 
be supprest, many 
dangerons diseases will follow. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
 
In the cure of this, and of all 
the other following effects, 
[^p.22^] 
I will observe this order. 
The cure shall bee taken 
from Chirurgicall, Pharmaceuticall, 
and Diæteticall 
meanes. 
 
This suppression is a plethoricke 
affect, and must 
be taken away by evacuation: 
and therefore first we 
will beginne with Phlebotomie. 
 
In the middest of the 
menstruall period open the 
Liver veine; and for the reversion 
of the humour, two 
dayes before the wonted 
evacution, open the Saphena 
on both feet. If the repletion 
be not great, apply cupping 
glasses to the legges 
and thighs. And although 
there be no hope to remove 
the suppression (as in some 
the Cotyledones are so closed 
[^p.23^] 
up, that nothing but copulation 
will open them) 
yet it will be convenient, as 
much as may be, to ease nature 
of her burden, by opening 
the Hemerhoid veines 
with a Leech. 
 
After Phlebotomie, let 
the humours bee prepared 
and made fluxile with syrrupe 
of Stæchas, Calamint, Betonie, 
Hysop, Mugwort, Horehound, 
Fumeterre, Maiden-haire. 
Bathe with Camomill, 
Penny-royall, Savine, Bay-leaves, 
Iuniper berries, Rue, 
Marjoram, Feverfew. +R of the 
leaves of Nep, Maiden-haire, 
Succory, Betony, ana.m.j. make 
a decoction: take thereof +o iij. 
syrrupe of Maiden-haire, Mugwort, 
Succory, ana.+o s. Misce: 
After she comes out of the 
Bath, let her drinke it off. 
[^p.24^] 
Purge with Pil. de Agarico, 
Elephang. Coch. Fætid. Galen 
in this cause commends pil. 
de Hiera cum Colocyntide, for 
as they bee proper to purge 
the humour offending, so 
also they doe open the passages 
of the wombe, and 
strengthen the faculty by 
their Aromaticall quality. 
 
If the stomacke be overcharged, 
let her take a vomit; 
yet such a one as may 
worke both wayes, lest working 
onely upward, it should 
too much turne backe the 
humour. +R Trochisks of Agrick 
+Q ij. infuse them in +o iij. of Oximel, 
in which dissolve of the Electuary 
Diasarum +q is. Benedic. 
Laxat. +o s: Take this after 
the manner of a purge. 
 
After the humour hath 
beene purged, proceed to 
[^p.25^] 
more proper and forceable 
remedies. +R trochiscks of 
myrrhe +Q is: persly-seed, castor, 
rindes of cassia ana +q i. 
of the extract of mugwort 
+q is. muske gr. x. with the 
juce of smallage make 12 
pils, tak 2 every morning or 
after supper going to bed. +R.

valerian, aristolochia, 
ana +Q ii. roots of Asrum +Q i. 
castor, saffron, ana +q ii. spec. 
diambræ. +Q ii. trochisks of 
myrrhe, +q iiii, tartari vitriolati, 
+q ii make all into a powder; 
with mugwort water 
and suger qs make lozenges, 
take +Q i of them every morning: 
or mingle +Q i of the 
powder with +Q i of sugar and 
take it in white wine. +R 
of prepared steele, specierum 
hieræ ana +Q ii. borace, 
[^p.26^] 
species of myrrhe, ana +q i. 
with the juce of savine make 
38. take three every other 
day immediatly before dinner. 
+R of castor +q i. wilde 
carret seed +Q s. with syrrupe 
of mugwort make 4 pils take 
them in the morning fasting, 
and so for three dayes together 
before the wonted time 
of the purgations. +R of Agaricke, 
aristolochia, juce of 
horehound, ana +Q v. rhubarb, 
spicknard, anice-seed, galbanum, 
assafætida, smallage 
roots, gentiane,of the three 
peppers, laccæ, ana +Q vi. with 
honie make an electuarie: 
take of it +Q iii for a dosis. In 
flegmaticall bodies nothing 
better can bee given then 
the decoction of the wood 
guaiacum with a little Dictam 
taken in the morning 
[^p.27^] 
fasting, and so for 12 dayes 
together without provokeing 
of sweate. 
 
Administer to the lower 
parts by suffumigations, pessaries, 
unctions, injections, 
insessions. 
 
Make suffumigations of 
cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, 
bayberries, mugwort, galbanum, 
melanthium, Amber 
&c. Make pessaryes of figgs, 
and the leaves of mercury 
brused and rowled up with 
lint. If you desire a stronger; 
make one of myrrhe, 
bdelium, opopanax, Ammoniacum, 
galbanum, sagapenum, 
mithridate, agarick, 
coloquintida &c. Make injections 
of the decoction of 
origane, mugwort, mercurie, 
betonie and figgs powring 
the same into the 
[^p.28^] 
wombe by a metrenchyta. 
+R oyle of sweet and bitter 
almonds, lillies, capers, 
chammomill ana +o s. ladani, 
oyle of myrrhe, ana +Q ii. with 
wax make an unguent; with 
which let the places bee anointed. 
Make insessions of 
fængreeke, chammomill, 
melilote, dill, marjerom, 
pennyroyall, feverfew, juniper 
berries, and calamynt. 
But if the suppression comes 
by a defect of matter, then 
ought not the cources to be 
provoked, untill the spirits 
bee animated and the blood 
againe encreased. Or if by 
proper affects of the wombe, 
as dropsies, inflammations, 
and the like; then must a 
particular cure bee used, the 
which I will not insist upon 
here, but of them as they lie 
in order. 
 
[^p.29^] 
If the retention comes 
from repletion or fulnesse; 
let the aire bee hote and 
drie; use moderate exercise 
before meales; Let your 
sleep bee shorter then ordinary; 
and your meat and 
drinke attenuating. Seeth 
with your meat garden savorie, 
time, origan and [/42./] 
ciche peason. If of emptinesse 
or defect of matter; let 
the ayre bee moyst and moderately 
hote. Shun excercise 
and watchings, let your 
meate bee nourishing, and 
of a light digestion; as reare 
eggs, lambe, chickens, almond 
milke and the like. 
 
[^p.30^] 
CHAP. III. 
 
[}Of the overflowing of 
the cources.}] 
 
[/43./] 
THE Scholearium saith, 
by comparing of contraries, 
truth is made manifest. 
Having therefore spoken of 
the suppression of the terms; 
order requires now, that I 
should insist upon the overflowing 
of them, an effect 
no lesse dangerous then the 
former. And this immoderate 
flux of the months is 
defined to be a sanguineous 
excrement proceeding from 
the wombe, exceeding 
both in quantity and time. 
First it is said to be sanguineous 
the matter of the flux 
being only blood; wherein 
[^p.31^] 
it differs from [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
commonly called the false 
cources, or whites; of which 
I will speake hereafter. Secondly 
it is said to proceed 
from the wombe: for there 
are two wayes by which the 
blood flowes forth. The one 
is by the internall veynes in 
in the body of the wombe; 
and this is properly called 
the monthly flux. The other 
is by those veynes which are 
terminated in the necke of 
the matrice and this is called 
of Ætius the Hemorrhodes 
of the wombe. Lastly 
it is said to exceed both in 
quantity and time. In quantity 
sayth Hippocrates when 
[/44./] 
they flow above 18 ounces. 
In time saith Aristotle when 
they flow above three dayes. 
[/45./] 
But wee take this for a certaine 
[^p.32^] 
character of their inordinate 
flowing, when the 
faculties of the body thereby 
are weakened. In bodyes 
abounding with grosse 
humours, this immoderate 
flux sometimes unburdens 
nature of her load and ought 
not, to bee stayed without 
the councell of a Physitian. 
 
[}Cause.}] 
 
The cause of this affect is 
internall or externall. The 
internall cause is threefold; 
in the matter, instrument, 
or faculty. The matter, 
which is the blood, may be 
vitious two wayes. First, in 
quantity, it being so great 
that the veynes are not able 
[/46./] 
to contayne it. Secondly, in 
guality, it being adust, sharp, 
watrish or unconcocted. 
[^p.33^] 
The instrument viz: the 
veynes are faulty by the 
dilatation of the orifice; 
which may bee caused two 
wayes: first, by the heate of 
[/47./] 
the constitution, climate or 
season, heating the blood 
whereby the passages are dilated, 
and the faculty weakned 
that it cannot retaine 
the blood. Secondly, by fals, 
[/48./] 
blowes, violent motion, 
breaking of a veyne, &c. 
 
The externall cause may 
be calidity of the aire, lifting, 
carrying of heavy burdens, 
unnaturall child birth, 
falls,&c. 
 
[}Signes.}] 
 
In this inordinate flux the 
appetite is decayed;the concoctions 
depraved, and all 
the actions weakened, the 
[^p.34^] 
feet are swelled, the colour 
of the face is changed, and 
a generall feeblenes possesseth 
the whole body. If the 
flux comes by the breaking 
of a veine, the body is something 
cold, the blood flowes 
forth on heapes and that 
suddenly with great payne. 
If it comes through heate, 
the orifice of the veynes being 
dilated, then is there 
little or no payne, yet the 
blood flowes faster then it 
doth in an Erosion, and not 
so fast as it doth in a Rupture. 
If by Erosion or sharpnesse 
of blood, shee feeles a 
great heate scalding the passage; 
It differs from the other 
two, in that it flowes 
not so suddenly nor so copiously 
as they doe. If by 
weaknesse of the wombe, 
[^p.35^] 
shee abhorreth the use of 
Venus. Lastly if it proceeds 
from an evill quality in the 
blood; droppe some of it 
on a cloth and when it is 
[/49./] 
drie, you may judge of the 
quality by the colour. If it 
bee cholericke it will bee 
yellow; If melancholie, 
blacke; If flegmaticall, watrish 
and whitish. 
 
[}Prognosticks.}] 
 
If with the flux be joyned 
a convulsion, it is [/50./] dangerous, 
because it intimates 
the more noble parts 
are vitiated; and a convulsion 
caused by emptinesse is 
deadly. If it continues long 
it will bee cured with great 
difficulty: for it was one of 
the miracles which our Saviour 
[/51./] 
Christ wrought to cure 
[^p.36^] 
this disease when it had 
continued 12 yeares. To 
conclude, if the flux bee 
inordinate [/52./] many diseases 
will ensue; and without remedy, 
the blood together 
with the native heate being 
consumed, either chacheriall, 
hydropicall, or paralyticall 
diseases will follow. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
 
The cure consisteth in 
three particulars. First, in 
repelling and carrying back 
of the blood. Secondly, in 
correcting and taking away 
the fluxibility of the matter. 
Thirdly, in corroborating 
the veynes and faculty. 
For the first; To cause a regression 
of the blood, open 
a veyne in the arme, and 
draw out so much blood as 
[^p.37^] 
the strength of the patient 
will permit; and that not 
[/53./] 
together, but at severall 
times; for hereby the spirits 
are the lesse weakened, and 
the retraction so much the 
greater. 
 
Apply cupping-glasses to 
the [/54./] brests; and also to [/55./] the 
liver that the reversion may 
be in the fountaine. 
 
To correct the fluxibility 
of the matter, catharticall 
meanes moderated with astrictories 
must be used. 
 
If it be caused by erosion 
or sharpnesse of blood; consider 
whether the Erosion 
bee by salt flegme, or adust 
choller. If by salt flegme; 
Prepare with sirupe of violets, 
wormewood, roses, 
citron-pills, succorie, &c. 
then take this purgation following. 
[^p.38^] 
+R. myrobolan.chebul. 
+o s. trochiscks of agaricke 
+Q i. with plantaine water 
make a decoction: adde 
thereunto sir.rosat. lax. +o iii. 
make a potion. 
 
If by adust choller prepare 
the body with sirrupe 
of roses, myrtles, sorrell, 
purcelaine, commixt with 
water of plantaine, knotgrasse, 
and endive; Then 
purge with this potion. +R. 
rindes of myrobolanes rhubarbe, 
ana +Q i. cinnamon gr. 
xv. infuse them one night in 
 
endive water: Adde to the 
straining pulpe of tamarind, 
cassia ana +o s. sirupe of roses 
+o i. make a potion. 
 
If the blood bee watrish 
and unconcoct as it is in hydropicall 
bodies and flowes 
forth by reason of the tenuitie 
[^p.39^] 
and thinnesse, the use of 
of hydragoga will bee profitable. 
Purge with agarick, 
elaterium, and coloquintida. 
Sweating is proper in this 
cause, for by it the matter 
offending is taken away,and 
the motion of the blood is 
carried to the outward parts. 
To procure sweate she may 
take cardvus water with mithridate: 
or the decoction 
of guajacum, sassafras, and 
sarsa-parilla, the gumme of 
guajacum also doth greatly 
provoke sweate. Pills of Sarsa-parilla 
taken every night 
going to bed are worthily 
commended. If the blood 
flowes forth from the opening 
or breaking of a veyne, 
without any evill quality in 
its selfe, then ought onely 
corroboratives to bee applied; 
[^p.40^] 
which is the last thing 
to bee done in the cure of 
this inordinate flux. 
 
+R. Of bole-armonie +q i;

Or if the flux hath continued 
long +R. Of masticke

make lozenges. Asses dung 
is well approoved of whether 
[^p.41^]

of quinces, or applied 
outwardly with steeled water. 
Galen by conveighing 
the juce of it through a metrenchita 
into the wombe 4. 
dayes together, cured this 
immoderate flux which no 
wayes else could bee restrained. 
Going to bed let her 
take +q is. Philonii Romani in a 
wafer, make suffumigations 
for the matrice of masticke,

not forgetting the hoofe of

and the other behinde. 
If the blood flowes from 
those veynes which are terminated 
in the necke of the 
matrice, then it is not called 
the overflowing of the 
termes but the hemorrhods 
of the wombe: yet the same 
cure will serve tehm both; 
only the instrumentall cure 
will a little differ; for in the 
esterine hemorrhods, the 
ends of the veynes hang 
[^p.43^] 
over like little teates or 
pushes which must be taken 
away by [/56./] incision,and then 
[/57./] 
the veynes closed up with 
Aloes, fine bole, burnt alum, 
troch. de terra sigil. 
myrrh, masticke, with the 
juce of comfery and knot-grasse 
laid plasterwise thereto. 
 
The aire must be cold and 
drie: all motion of the body 
is forbidden. Let her meat 
bee Pheasant, Partridge, 
mountaine birds, Cunnies, 
Calfes feet, &c. and let her 
beere bee mixt with the 
juce of quinces and pomgranuts.

CHAP. IIII. 
 
[}Of the Weeping of the 
wombe.}] 
 
THE Weeping of the 
wombe is an unnaturall 
flux of blood comming 
from the wombe by dropps 
or after the manner of 
teares; causing violent pains 
in the same; keeping neither 
period nor time. By 
some it is referred unto the 
immoderate evacuation of 
the cources, yet they are 
distinguisht in the quantity 
[/58./] 
and manner of their flowing. 
In that they flow copiously 
and freely; In this 
continually, yet by [/59./] little 
and little, and that with 
great paine and difficulty: 
[^p.45^] 
Wherefore it is likened unto 
the [/60./] strangurie. 
 
[}Cause.}] 
 
The cause is in the facultie, 
instrument or matter. 
In the facultie, by being enfeebled, 
that it cannot expell 
the blood: and the blood 
resting there, makes the 
parts of the wombe grow 
hard and stretcheth the vessells, 
from whence proceeds 
the [/61./] paine in the wombe. 
In the instrument, by the 
narrownesse of the passages. 
Lastly, it may be in the matter 
of the blood, which may 
offend in too great a quantity, 
or in an evill quality, 
it being grosse and thicke 
that it cannot flow forth as 
it ought to doe, but by 
drops. 
 
[^p.46^] 
[}Signes.}] 
 
The signes will best appeare 
by the relation of the 
patient. 
 
[}Prognosticks.}] 
 
Hereupon will ensue 
paines in the head, stomacke 
and backe, with inflammations 
suffocations,and excoriations 
of the matrice. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
 
If the strength of the patient 
will permit, first open 
a veine in the arme, rubbe 
the upper parts, and let her 
armes bee corded, that the 
force of the blood may bee 
carried backward. 
 
The apply such things as 
may laxate and mollifie the 
stretching of the wombe 
[^p.47^] 
and asswage the sharpnesse 
of the blood; as cataplasmes 
made of bran, lineseed, fængrecke, 
melilote, mallows, 
mercurie and atriplex: If 
the blood bee viscuous and 
grosse adde thereto mugwort, 
calamint, dictam, 
and betonie: And let 
her take of Venice treakle 
the quantity of a nutmeg 
with sirrup of mugwort every 
morning. Anoint the 
places with oyle of lillies 
roses, lineseed, sweete almonds, 
and calfes marrow. 
Make injections of the decoction 
of mallows, mercurie, 
lineseed, groundsuell, 
mugwort, fængrecke, with 
oyle of sweet almonds. 
 
Sometimes it is caused 
by a winde, and then phlebotonie 
is to bee omitted; 
[^p.48^] 
and in the stead thereof +R. 
Sirupe of feverfew +o i. honie 
of roses, sirupe of stæchas, 
ana +o s. water of calamint, 
mugwort, betonie, hysope 
ana +o i. make a julep. If the 
paine continues, take this 
purgation. +R. Specierum hieræ 
+Q i. diachatholicon +o s. Sirupe 
of roses laxative +o i. 
with the decoction of mugwort, 
and the 4. cordiall 
flowers make a potion. If it 
comes through weaknesse 
of the facultie, let that bee 
corroborated. If through 
grossenesse or sharpnesse of 
the blood, let the quality 
of it bee altered as I have 
shewne in the foregoing 
chapter. Lastly if the excrements 
of the gutte be retained, 
provoke them by a clyster, 
of the decoction of 
[^p.49^] 
chammomill, betony, feverfew, 
mallowes, lineseed, 
juniper-berries, cumminseed, 
aniceseed, melilote: 
adding thereto of diacatholicon, 
+o s. hieræ picræ +Q ii. hony, 
oyle, ana +o i. salniter +Q is. The 
patient must abstaine from 
salt, sharp,and windy meats. 
 
CHAP. V. 
 
[}Of the false cources 
or whites.}] 
 
FRom the wombe proceeds 
[/62./] 
not only the menstruous 
blood, but accidentally, 
many other excrements 
which by the Ancients 
are comprehended under 
the title of [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
which is a distillation of variety 
of corrupt humours 
[^p.50^] 
through the wombe, flowing 
from the whole body, or 
part of the same; keeping 
neither cource, nor colour, 
but varying in both. 
 
[}Cause.}] 
 
The cause, is either promiscuously 
in the whole bodie, 
by a cachochymia or 
weaknesse of the same; or in 
some of the parts; as in the 
liver, which by the inabilitie 
of the sanguifficative faculty, 
causeth a generation of 
corrupt blood; and then 
the matter is ruddish; 
sometimes in the gall, being 
sluggish in its office, not 
drawing away those cholericke 
superfluities, which are 
ingendred in the liver; and 
the matter is yellowish. 
Sometimes in the Spleene, 
[^p.51^] 
not defecating and clensing 
the blood of the dregges and 
excrementitious parts; and 
then the matter flowing 
forth, is blackish. It may also 
come from catarrhes in the 
head; or from any other putrified 
or corrupted member. 
[/63./] 
But if the matter of the 
flux bee white, the cause is 
either in the stomacke, or 
reynes. In the stomacke by 
a flegmaticall and crude matter 
there contracted, and vitiated 
through [/64./] griefe, melancholie, 
and other distempers: 
for otherwise, if the 
matter were onely Pituita, 
crude flegme, and no wayes 
corrupt or vitiated, being 
taken unto the liver it might 
bee converted into blood, 
for flegme in the ventricle, is 
called [/65./] nourishment halfe 
[^p.52^] 
digested: But being corrupt 
[/66./] 
though sent unto the 
liver, yet it cannot bee turned 
into nutriment; for the 
second concoction cannot 
correct that which the first 
hath corrupted; and therefore 
the liver sends it to the 
wombe which can neither 
disgest it nor repell it and so 
it is voided out, still keeping 
the colour which it had in 
the ventricle. The cause also 
may be in the reynes being 
over heat, whereby the 
spermaticall matter by reason 
of its thinnesse flowes 
forth. The externall cause 
may bee moystnesse of the 
aire, eating of corrupt meats, 
anger, griefe, slothfulnesse, 
immoderate sleeping, costivenesse 
of body. 
 
[^p.53^] 
[}Signes.}] 
 
The signes are extenuation 
of the body, shortnesse 
and stinking of breath, loathing 
of meate, paine in the 
head, swelling of the eyes 
and feet, melancholie, humidity 
flowes from the 
wombe of divers colours, as 
reddish, blacke, greene, yellow, 
white. It differs from 
the flowing and overflowing 
of the cources, in that 
it keepes no certaine periods, 
and is of many colours, 
all which doe degenerate 
from blood. 
 
[}Prognosticks.}] 
 
If the flux be flegmaticall 
it will continue long and be 
difficult to cure yet if vomiting 
or the flux Diarrhæa 
[^p.54^] 
hapeneth, diverting the humour 
it cures the disease. 
If it bee cholericke, it is not 
so permanent, yet more perilous, 
for it will cause (Rhagadia) 
clifts in the necke of 
the wombe, and sometimes 
make an excoriation in the 
matrix. If melancholius, it is 
most dangerous and contumacious: 
yet the [/67./] flux of 
the Hemorrhodes administers 
cure. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
 
If the matter flowing 
forth, bee reddish, open a 
veine on the arme; if not, 
apply ligatures to the armes 
[/68./] 
and shoulders. Galen glories 
of himselfe how hee cured 
the wife of Boetus labouring 
of this disease, by rubbing 
the upper parts with crude 
hony. 
 
[^p.55^] 
It it be caused by a distillation 
from the braine, take 
sirrup of betonie, stæchas, 
and marjerom. Purge with 
pil. coch. sine quibus, de Agarico: 
Make nasalia of the juce 
of sage, hysope, betonie, 
nigella, with one drop of 
oyle of cloves and a little 
silke cotton. +R. elect. dianth. 
aromat.rosat.diambræ, diamosci 
dulcis, ana +Q i. nutmeg +Q s. 
with sugar and betonie water, 
make lozenges, to be taken every 
morning and eveuing. Take Aureæ 
Alexandrinæ +Q s. at night 
going to bed. If these things 
help not, use the suffumigation, 
and plaster as they are prescribed 
pag. 203. 
 
If it proceeds from crudities 
in the stomacke, or from 
a cold distempered liver, 
take every morning of the 
[^p.56^] 
decoction of lignum sanctum. 
Purge with pil. de agarico, 
de hermodact. de hiera diacolocynthid. 
fætidæ, agrigativæ. 
+R. elect. aromat. ros. +Q ii. cytron-pills 
dried, nutmeg, long 
pepper, ana +q i. diagalangæ +Q i. 
santali albi, ligni aloes ana +q s. 
sugar +o vi. with mint water 
make lozenges. Take of them before 
meales. If with frigidity of 
the liver, there be joynd a repletion 
of the stomacke, purging by 
vomit is commendable: for 
which take +Q iii. of the Electuary 
diasaru. Galen allowes of 
dureticall meanes; as of Apium, 
petroselinum &c. 
 
If the matter of the flux bee 
cholericke, prepare the humour 
with sirrup of roses, violets, endive, 
succorie. Purge with myrobolanes, 
manna, rhubarbe, 
cassia. +R. of rhubarbe +Q ii. 
[^p.57^] 
anice-seed +Q i. cinnamon +q is. 
infuse them in +o vi. of prune 
broth. Adde to the strayning of 
manna +o i; and take it in the 
morning according to art. +R. 
specierum diatrionsantalon, 
diatragacant. frig. diarrhod. 
abbatis, diacydonit. ana +Q i. sugar 
+o iiii. with plantaine water 
make lozenges. If the clyster of 
the gall bee sluggish and doe not 
stirre up the facultie of the guts, 
give hot glisters of the decoction 
of the foure mollifying hearbes 
with hony of roses and Aloes. 
 
If the flux be melancholious, 
prepare with sirrup of mayden-haire, 
epithimum, polipodie, 
borrage, buglosse, fumeterre; 
harts-tongue, and sirrupus bysantinus, 
which must bee made 
without vineger: otherwise it 
will rather animate the disease 
then nature; for melancholie by 
[^p.58^] 
the use of vineger is increased; 
and both by Hippocrates, Sylvius, 
and Avenzoar it is disallowed of, 
as an enemie [/69./] to the 
wombe, and therefore not to bee 
used inwardly in uterine diseases. 
 
Purgers of melancholie are 
pilulæ fumariæ, pilulæ Inde, 
[/70./] 
pil de lapide lazuli, diasena and 
confectio hamech. +R. of stamped 
prunes +o ii. sene +Q i. epithimum,

+Q is. sowre dates +o i. with endive 
water make a decoction: Take 
here of +o iiii, adde unto it confectionis 
hamech +Q iii. manna 
+Q iii. Or +R. pil. Indarum, pil. 
fætidarum, agarici trochiscati 
ana +q i. pills of rhubarbe +q s. lapidis

condited +Q i. sugar +o vii. with 
rosewater make lozenges. 
 
Lastly let the wombe be clensed, 
from the corrupt matter and 
then corroborated: for the purifying 
thereof, make injections of 
the decoction of betony, feverfew, 
mugwort, spikenard, bistort, 
mercury, sage, adding 
thereto sugar, oyle of sweet Almonds 
ana +o ii. pessaries also 
may bee made of silke cotton, madified 
in the juce of the forenamed 
hearbs. To corroborate the 
wombe, you may thus prepare trochiskes. 
+R. Of mugwort, feverfew, myrrhis, amber, mace, 
nutmeg, stirax, ligni aloes, 
red roses ana +o i. with the mucilage 
of tragacanth make trochisks: 
cast some of them on the 
[^p.60^] 
coles, and smother the wombe 
therewith. Make fomentations 
for the wombe, of red wine in 
which hath beene decocted masticke, 
fine bole balaustia and 
red roses: Annoint the matrix 
with oyle of quinces and myrtles, 
and apply thereto Emplastrum 
pro matrice; and let her take of 
diamoscum dulce and elect. Aromaticum, 
every morning. 
 
A drying [/71./] diet is commended 
to bee best, because in this affect 
the body most commonly abounds 
with flegmaticall and crude humours. 
[/72./] 
For this cause Hippocrates 
councells the patient to 
goe to bed supperlesse. Let her 
meat bee Partridge, Phesant, 
mountaine-birds rather rosted 
then boyled. Immoderate sleep 
is forbidden, moderate exercise 
is commended. 
 
[^p.61^] 
CHAP. VI. 
 
[}Of the Suffocation of 
the Mother.}] 
 
THis affect which simply 
considered is none, 
but the cause of an affect, is 
called in English the Suffocation 
of the Mother, not because 
[/73./] 
the wombe is strangled, 
but for that it causeth 
the woman to bee choked. 
It is a retraction of the 
wombe towards the Diaphragme 
and stomacke, 
which presseth and crusheth 
up the same, that the instrumentall 
cause of respiration 
the midriffe is suffocated; 
which consenting with the 
braine causeth the Animall 
facultie the efficient cause of 
[^p.62^] 
respiration also to bee intercepted; 
whereby the body 
being refrigerated, and the 
actions depraved, she falls to 
the ground, as one being 
dead. 
 
In these histericall passions 
some continue longer, 
some shorter. Rabby Moyses 
[/74./] 
writes of some, which lay in 
the paroxisme of the fit two 
dayes. Ruffius makes mention, 
of one, which continued 
in the same passion, three 
dayes and three nights; and 
at the three dayes end shee 
revived. That we may learne 
by other mens harmes to beware, 
I will give you one 
[/75./] 
example more. Paræus writeth 
of a woman in Spayne, 
which suddainly fell into a 
uterine suffocation and appeared 
to the judgement of 
[^p.63^] 
man as dead: her friends 
wondring at this her suddaine 
change, for their better 
satisfaction, sent to the 
Chirurgian to have her dissected, 
who beginning to 
make an incision, the woman 
began to move, and 
with a great clamour returned 
to herselfe againe, to the 
horrour and admiration of 
all the spectators. 
 
To the end therfore, you 
may distinguish the living 
from the dead, the Ancients 
prescribe three experiments. 
The first, is to lay a 
light feather to the mouth, 
and by the motion of it you 
may judge, whether the patient 
be living or dead. The 
second, is to place a glasse of 
water on the brest, and if 
you perceive it to move, it 
[^p.64^] 
betokeneth life. The third 
is to hold a pure Looking-glasse 
to the mouth & nose; 
and if the glasse appeare 
thicke with a little dew npon 
it, it betokeneth life. 
And these three experiments 
are good; yet with 
this caution, that you ought 
not to depend on them too 
much: for, though the feather 
and the water doe not 
move, and the glasse continue 
pure and cleare, yet it is 
not a necessary consequence 
that shee is destitute of life: 
for,the motion of the lungs, 
by which the respiration is 
made, may bee taken away 
that shee cannot breath, yet 
the internall transpiration 
of the heate may remaine, 
which is not manifested by 
the motion of the brest, or 
[^p.65^] 
lungs, but lies occult in the 
heart and inward arteries. 
Examples [/76./] hereof wee may 
have in the flie and swallow, 
which in the cold of winter, 
to the ocular aspect, seeme 
dead, inanimate, and breath 
not at all, yet they live by 
the transpiration of that heat 
which is reserved in the 
heart and inward arteries; 
therefore when the summer 
approcheth, the internall 
heat being revocated to the 
outward parts, they are then 
againe revived out of their 
sleepie extasie. 
 
Those women therefore 
that seeme to die suddainly, 
and upon no evident cause, 
let them not bee committed 
unto the earth untill the end 
of three dayes, lest the living 
be buried for the dead. 
 
[^p.66^] 
[}Cause.}] 
 
The part affected is the 
wombe; of which there is a 
twofold motion, naturall 
and Symptomaticall. The 
naturall motion, is when the 
wombe attracteth the humane 
seed, or excludeth the 
infant or secundine. The 
Symptomaticall motion, of 
which we are here to speak, 
is a convulsive drawing upward 
of the wombe. 
 
The cause usually is in the 
retention of the seed, or 
in the suppression of the 
monthes, causing a repletion 
of corrupt humours in 
the wombe; from whence 
proceeds a flatulent refrigeration, 
causing a convulsion 
of the ligaments of the 
wombe. And as it may 
[^p.67^] 
come from humidity or repletion, 
being a convulsion, 
it may bee caused by emptinesse 
or [/77./] drinesse: and lastly, 
by Abortion or difficult 
childe-birth. 
 
[}Signes.}] 
 
At the approaching of the 
[/78./] 
suffocation there is a palenesse 
of the face, weaknesse 
of the legges, shortnesse of 
breath, frigidity of the whole 
body with a working up into 
the throat, and then shee 
falls down as one voyd both 
of sence and motion. The 
mouth of the wombe is closed 
up, and being touched 
with the finger feels hard. 
The paroxisme of the fit 
once past, shee openeth her 
eyes, and feeling her stomacke 
opprest, shee offers 
[^p.68^] 
to vomit. And least that any 
should bee deceived in 
taking one disease for another, 
I will shew how it may 
bee distinguisht from those 
diseases which have the 
neerest affinity with its selfe. 
It differs from the Apoplexie, 
being it comes without 
shreeking out also in the hystericall 
passion, the sence of 
feeling is not altogether so 
destroyed and lost, as it is in 
 the Apoplecticall disease. It 
differs from the Epilepsie 
in that the eyes are not 
wrested, neither doe any 
spumy froth come from the 
mouth; and that convulsive 
motion which sometime is 
joyned to the suffocation, is 
not so universall, as it is in 
the epilepsie, onely this or 
that member is convulst,and 
[^p.69^] 
that without any vehement 
agitation. In the Sincope 
both respiration and pulse is 
taken away; the countinance 
waxeth pale, & she swounds 
away suddainly; but in the 
histericall passion,commonly 
there is both respiration 
and pulse though it cannot 
well bee perceived her face 
looks red, and shee hath a 
forewar ing of her fit. Yet 
it is not denied but that a 
Sincope may be joyned with 
this suffocation. Lastly, it is 
distinguisht from the Lethargie 
by the pulse which 
in the one is great in the other 
little. 
 
[}Prognosticks.}] 
 
If disease hath its being 
from the corruption of the 
seed, it foretells [/79./] more danger 
[^p.70^] 
then if it proceeded fro~ 
the suppression of the cources; 
because the seed is concocted, 
and of a purer quality, 
than the menstruous 
blood; and the more pure 
being corrupted, becomes 
the more foule and filthie; 
as appeares in egges the purest 
nourishment, which vitiated 
yeeld the noysomest 
savour. It if be accompained 
with a Sincope, it shewes 
nature is but weake, and that 
the spirits are almost exhaust. 
But if [/80./] neezing followes, 
it shewes that the 
heat which was almost extinct 
doth now begin to returne, 
and that nature will 
subdue the disease. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
 
In the cure of this affect two 
[^p.71^] 
things must bee observed: 
first, that during the time of 
the pararoxisme, nature be 
provoked to expel those malignant 
vapours which binds 
up the sences, that shee may 
be recalled out of that sleepie 
extasie. Secondly, that 
in the intermission of the fit, 
propper medicines bee applied 
to take away the cause. 
 
To stirre up nature, fasten 
cupping-glasses, to the hipps 
and navell: Apply ligatures 
to the thighs. Rubbe the extreame 
parts with salt vineger 
& musturd. Cause lowd 
clamours and thundrings in 
her eares. Apply to the nose 
Assa fætida, castor and saga penum 
steeped in vineger.Provoke 
her to neeze, by blowing 
up into her nose the 
powder of castor, white pepper, 
[^p.72^] 
pellitory, of Spaine, and white 
Hellebore. Hold under her 
nose Partridge feathers haire 
and old shoes burnt and all 
other stinking things: for 
evill odour are an enemie 
to nature, hence the Animall 
spirits doe so contest 
and strive against them, that 
the naturall heate is thereby 
restored. The braine is so 
opprest sometimes that wee 
are compeld to burne the 
outward skin of the head, 
with hot oyle, or with a hot 
iron. Sharp clysters and suppositories 
are available. +R. 
Of sage, calamint, horehound, 
feverfew, marierom betonie, hysope, 
ana m. i. anice seed +o s. coloquintida, 
white hellebore, salis 
gemmæ ana +Q ii. boyle these in 
lib. ii. of water to the halfe:

a clyster. Or +R. of hony boyled 
+o ii. euphorbii +q s. Coloqnintida. 
gr. iiii white hellebore gr. ii.

Hippocrates writeth of a hystoricall 
[/81./] 
woman which could 
not bee freed from the paroxisme, 
but by powring cold 
water on her: yet this cure 
is particular, and ought to be 
administred, in the [/82./] middest 
of summer when the Sun is 
[/83./] 
in the Tropicke of Cancer. 
[/84./] 
 
If it bee caused by the retention 
and corruption of 
the seed; at the instant of the 
paroxisme, let the Midwife 
tak oyle of lillies, marjerom, 
and bayes, dissolving in the 
same of Civet and Muske 
ana gr. ii. Let her dippe her 
finger therein and put it up 
into the neck of the wombe 
[^p.74^] 
tickling and rubbing the 
same. 
 
The fit being over, proceed 
to the curing of the 
cause. If it ariseth from the 
suppression of the months 
looke the cure, page 25. If 
from the retention of the 
seed, a good husband will 
administer cure: But those 
which cannot honestly purchase 
that cure, must use 
such things as will drie up 
and diminish the seed, as 
Diacyminum, diacalaminthes, 
&c. Amongst Botanicks, the 
seed of Agnus Castus is well 
esteemed of whether taken 
inwardly, applied outwardly, 
or received as a suffumigation. 
It was held in great 
[/85./] honour amongst the Athenians, 
for by it they did remaine 
as pure Vestales, and 
[^p.75^] 
preserved their chastity,only 
by strowing it in the bed 
whereon they lay; hence the 
name Agnus Castus, is taken 
from the effect. Make an

observed, the moderate use 
of Venus is commended. Let

CHAP. VII. 
 
[}Of the descending or falling 
downe of the Mother.}] 
 
THe falling down of the 
wombe is a relaxation 
of the ligatures, wherby the 
matrice is carried backward, 
and in some, hangs out in the 
[^p.79^] 
bignesse of an egge. Of this 
there bee two kindes distinguisht 
[/87./] 
of Fernelius by Descensus,and 
Prolapsus by a descending 
and a precipitation. 
The descending of the 
[/88./] 
wombe, is when it sinketh 
downe to the entrance of 
the privities, and appeares 
to the eye, either not at al or 
very little. The precipitation, 
[/89./] 
is when the wombe, like 
a purse, is turned the inside 
outward, and hangs bewixt 
the thighes in the bignesse 
of a cupping-glasse. 
 
[}Cause.}] 
 
The cause is externall, 
or internall. The externall 
cause is difficult child-birth, 
violent pulling away of the 
secondine, rashnesse and inexperience 
in drawing away 
[^p.80^] 
of the child, violent coughing, 
neezing, falls, blowes, 
carrying of heavie burdens. 
The internall cause in generall 
is overmuch humiditie 
flowing unto those parts, 
hindring the operations of 
the wombe, whereby the 
ligaments by which the 
wombe is supported are relaxt. 
The cause in particular, 
[/90./] 
is refer'd to bee in the 
retention of the seed; or in 
the suppressions of the 
courses. 
 
[}Signes.}] 
 
The Arsgut and the bladder 
oftentimes are so crushed, 
that the passage of both 
the excrements is hindered. 
If the urine doth flow 
forth, it is white and thick: 
the præcordia are molested, 
[^p.81^] 
the loynes be grieved; the 
privities payned; the womb 
sinkes down to the entrance 
of the private parts, or else 
comes cleane out. 
 
[}Prognosticks.}] 
 
This griefe possessing an 
old woman, is cured with 
great difficultie, because it 
weakens the faculties of 
the wombe, and therefore 
though it bee reduced into 
his propper place, yet uppon 
every occurrance it is 
subject to the like danger it 
was in before. So is it with 
the younger sort, if the disease 
be inveterate. If it bee 
caused by putrifaction, in 
the nerves it is incurable. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
 
The wombe naturally 
[^p.82^] 
being placed betweene the 
streight gut and the bladder, 
and now fallen down, ought 
not to be put up againe untill 
the facultie both of the 
guts and bladder bee stirred 
up. 
 
Nature being unloded of 
her burden, let the woman 
be placed on her [/91./] backe, in 
such sort that her legs may 
be higher then her head; let 
her feet be drawne up to her 
hinder parts, with her knees 
spread abroad. Then mollifie 
the swelling with oyle 
of Lillies and sweet Almonds; 
or with the decoction 
of mallows, beetes, fængreck, 
and lineseed. When 
the inflation is dissipated; 
let the midwife annoint her 
hand with oyle of Mastick 
and reduce the wombe into 
[^p.83^] 
its place. The matrice being 
put up, the situation of 
the patient must bee changed. 
Let her legs bee out at 
length and layd together. 
Set cuppingglasses to the 
brests and navill. Boyle 
Mugwort, Feverfew, red 
Roses, and Comferie in red 
Wine, and foment the places 
therewith. Make a suffumigation 
for the matrice

and Mastick;

Ladani, Masticke, ana +Q iii. 
Galbani +o s. Styracis +Q ii. make 
a plaster for the navill. Make 
pessaries of Assafætida, Saffron, 
Comfery, masticke, adding 
there to a little Castor. The 
practice of Paræus, in this 
[/92./] 
cause, was to make them only 
of corke, in figure like a 
little egge, covering them 
over with wax, and masticke 
dissolved together, fastning 
to it a thred, and so to put it 
up into the wombe. The 
present danger being new 
taken away, and the matrice 
seated in its naturall abode, 
[^p.85^] 
the remote cause must bee 
remooved. If the body bee 
plethoricke open a vene; 
Prepare with sirrup of betonie, 
calamint, hysope, and feverfew. 
Purge with pil. de hiera 
cum agarico, pil. de colocynthide. 
If the stomacke bee 
oporest by crudities, unburden 
it by vomiting. Sudorifficall 
decoctio~s of Lignum 
sanctum and sassifras taken 
twenty daies together dries, 
up the superfluous moister 
and consequently suppresseth 
the cause of the disease. 
 
Let the aire bee hote and 
drie, and your diet hote and 
attenuating. Abstaine from 
dancing, leaping, neezing, 
and from all motion both of 
body and minde Eate sparingly; 
drinke not much: 
sleepe moderately. 
 
[^p.86^] 
CHAP. VIII. 
 
[}Of the Inflammation of the 
wombe.}] 
 
THE Phlegmon or inflammation 
[/93./] 
of the matrice, is a tumour possessing 
the whole wombe or part of 
it, accompanied with unnaturall 
heate, by obstructions 
and gathering together of 
corrupt blood. 
 
[}Cause.}] 
 
The cause of this affect is 
suppression of the months, 
repletion of the whole body, 
immoderate use of Venus, 
often handling of the genitalls, 
difficult childe-birth, 
vehement agitation of the 
body, falls, blowes; to which 
also may bee added the use 
[^p.87^] 
of sharp pessaries, whereby 
not seldome the wombe is 
inflamed. Cupping-glasses 
also fastened to the pubes and 
hypogastrium draw the humours 
to the wombe. 
 
[}Signes.}] 
 
The signes are aguish horrours, 
paines in the head and 
stomacke, vomitting, coldnesse 
of the knees, convulsions 
of the necke, doting, 
trembling of the heart; 
sometimes there is a Dyspnæa 
or streightnes of breath, 
by reason of the heat which 
is communicated to the diaphragme. 
The brests symphathizing 
with the wombe are 
payned and swelled. Particular 
signes. If the forepart 
of the matrice be inflamed, 
the privities are grieved,the 
[^p.88^] 
urine is supprest, or flowes 
forth with difficutie. If the 
after part; the loynes and 
backe suffer, the excrements 
are retained. If the right side; 
the right hip suffers, the 
right legge is heavy slow to 
to motion, in so much that 
sometimes shee seemes to 
hault. And so if the left side 
of the wombe be inflamed, 
the left hip is payned, and 
the left legge is weaker then 
the right. If the necke of the 
wombe bee affected; the 
midwife, putting up her finger, 
shall feele the mouth of 
it retracted and closed up, 
with a hardnesse about it. 
 
[}Prognosticks.}] 
 
All inflammations of the 
wombe are [/94./] dangerous, if 
not deadly; and especially 
[^p.89^] 
if the totall substance of the 
matrice bee inflamed. Yet 
lesse perilous are they if they 
bee in the necke of the 
wombe. A flux of the belly 
foretells health if it bee naturall; 
for nature works best 
by the use of her owne instruments. 
 
[}Cure.}] 
 
In the cure, first, let the 
humours flowing to the 
wombe be repell'd; for effecting 
of which, after the 
bellie hath beene loosened 
by cooling clysters, phlebotomie 
will bee needfull. 
Open therefore a veine on 
the arme; and if shee be not 
with childe, the day after 
strike the Saphena on both 
feet. Fasten ligatures and 
Cupping-glasses to the 
[^p.90^] 
armes; rubbe the upper 
parts. 
 
Purge lightly with Cassia, 
Rhubarbe, Sene, Myrobolanes, 
&c. as, +R. Of Sene +Q ii. Anice

the beginning of the disease 
anoint the privities and 
reynes, with oyle of roses 
and quinces. Make plasters 
of Plantaine, Lineseed, 
Barley meale, Melilote, Fengrecke, 
whites of egges, and if 
the paine be vehement, adde 
a little opium. Foment the 
genitalls with the decoction 
of Poppieheads, purcelaine, 
knotgrasse, and water-lillies. 
Make injections of Goates-milke, 
[^p.91^] 
rose water, clarified 
whey, with hony of roses. In 
the declining of the disease, 
use insessions of Sage, Lineseed, 
Mugwort, Penny-royall, 
horehound, fængrecke. Anoint 
the lower parts of the belly 
with oyle of chammomill, and 
violets. +R. Of lilly roots, mallow

The aire must bee cold: 
All motion of the body, especially 
of the lower parts is 
forbidden Vigilancie is commended, 
[^p.93^] 
for by sleepe 
the humours are carried inward, 
whereby the inflammation 
is increased, eate 
sparingly. Let your drinke 
bee barley water or clarified 
whey; and your meate chickens 
and chicken broth boiled 
with endive succhorie, sorrell, 
buglosse and mallowes.
