[}OF A NVRSE, AND 
what election, and choice ought 
to be made of her. 
CHAP. I.}] 
 
THough it were fit, that euery mother 
should nurse her owne child: 
because her milke which is nothing 
else, but the bloud whitened 
(of which he was made, and wherwith 
hee had beene nourished the 
time hee staide in his Mothers wombe) will bee alwaies 
more naturall, and familiar vnto him, than 
that of a stranger: and also by nursing him her selfe, 
she shall be wholly accounted his mother: yet since 
they may be hindred by sicknes, or for that they are 
too weake and tender, or else because their Husbands 
will not suffer them, therefore I say, it will be 
[/1./] 
very necessary to seeke out another Nurse: and euery 
one knowes how hard a thing it is, to finde a 
good one, because they haue beene so often beguiled, 
and deceiued therein: which hath giuen mee 
occasion, first of all to shew some marks, whereby 
you may make some choise of one that is fit. 
 
Now, in chusing of a Nurse, there are sixe things 
[^p.2^] 
to be considered: Her birth and Parentage: her 
person: her behauiour: her mind: her milke: and 
her child. 
 
[/2./] 
First, Concerning her Lignage, she must come 
of a good stocke, or kinred: there being none of 
her race, whether it be grandfather, or grandmother, 
nay, not so much as one of her great grandfathers, 
or ancient progenitors, that hath euer been 
stayned, or spotted, either in bodie or mind: For, 
oftentimes we see, though the Parents be healthfull, 
and sound, yet their children be sometimes, 
either sickly, or fooles, or else viciously giuen: who 
retaine such vices from their grandfather, or grandmother, 
yea, and somtimes from their great grandfathers; 
which troubleth many men, to thinke from 
whence these accidents may proceed: For it is verie 
certaine, that there are many Children, which 
are diseased or deformed, either in bodie, or mind, 
whose parents are verie healthfull, and well featur'd: 
But yet, if you search farther, you shall find 
that some of their progenitors haue been affected 
in the like manner. 
 
[/3./] 
2. Touching the Nurses person; for her age, 
she shall be chosen, when she is at her full growth, 
which is about fiue and twentie yeares of age, from 
which time, to the fiue and thirtieth yeare, is the 
age, wherein women are most temperate, healthfull, 
strong, and lusty: therefore one shall be chosen, 
that is betweene fiue and twentie, and fiue and 
[/4./] 
thirtie yeares. Now, for her bodie, she ought to 
be of middle stature, neither too big, nor too little, 
[^p.3^] 
nor too fat, nor too leane, nor yet too grosse, 
hauing good fleshy armes, and legges; and her 
flesh being hard and firme: she must not be deformed, 
neither squint-ey'd, lame, nor crump shouldred: 
she must be one that is healthfull, and not 
subiect to any disease: the complexion and colour 
of her bodie, must be liuely, and rosie: she must not 
[/5./] 
be spotted with rednesse, and especially she should 
not haue red haire: and therefore, such as are of a 
browne complexion, are held to be best, whose 
haire is of a chest-nut colour, betweene yellow and 
blacke. 
 
[/6./] 
She must haue a pleasing countenance, a bright 
and cleare eie, a well formed nose, neither crooked, 
nor of a bad smell, a ruddie mouth, and verie white 
teeth: She must deliuer her words well, and distinctly, 
without stammering: and she must haue a 
[/7./] 
strong and big necke: for thereby (as Hippocrates 
saith) may one iudge, of the strength of the bodie. 
She must haue a broad and large breast, garnished 
with two Paps of a reasonable bignesse, neither 
limber, nor hanging downe, but betweene hard 
and soft; full of Azure veines and Arteries, not 
being either knottie, or swolne bigger then they 
should be: the nipple which is in the midst of the 
breasts, ought to be somewhat eminent, and withall 
a ruddie colour like a Strawberie, it must be of a 
reasonable bignesse and thicknesse, and of an easie 
draught, that the child may take it the better, and 
sucke the easier. 
 
She must not be with child, neither should she 
[^p.4^] 
[/8./] 
haue her naturall purgings; though Hippocrates 
seemes to allow the contrarie: relating the storie 
of a Nurse, whose bodie was full of Pustules, of 
which she was freed, as soone as she had her ordinary 
sicknesse: desiring (as some Interpreters would 
haue it) to shew, that it is not without reason, for 
the Nurses health, that she should haue her courses: 
thereby to coole and cleanse the bloud, whereof 
the milke is made. 
 
[/9./] 
3. She ought to be of a good behauiour, sober, 
and not giuen either to drinking, or gluttonie, 
milde, without being angry, or fretfull: for there is 
nothing that sooner corrupts the bloud, of which 
the milke is made, than choller, or sadnesse: and 
therefore she must be merry, playing and singing to 
the child, dandling and vsing him gently; and one 
that will not refuse to giue him the breast at any 
time, for feare least he crie. She must likewise be 
chast, not desiring after her husbands companie, 
and much lesse a strangers; because carnal copulation 
(as Galen saith) troubleth the bloud, and so by 
consequence the milke; also it diminisheth the 
quantitie thereof, by prouoking the naturall purgations; 
and also makes her haue an ill smell, (as Aristotle 
saith) because they heat themselues verie 
much in this act: and which is worst, the Nurse 
thinking onely to take her sport a little, may therby 
prooue with child. 
 
[/10./] 
4. Concerning her mind: Let her be sage, wise, 
discreet, that she may take care of her little one, 
and not lay him in any place, where he may indanger 
[^p.5^] 
himselfe, to be either sicke, or stifled: For, there 
are more Nurses then should be, which are such 
beasts, and so carelesse; who hauing their child 
sucke in the night, as they lie with them in the bed, 
do oftentimes fall a sleep vpon them, and so stifle 
them. And she must also haue discretion, to iudge 
somewhat neare, what her little one crieth after, it 
being not able otherwise to expresse what it would 
[/11./] 
haue: Obseruing (as Galen saith) the childs disposition, 
that so she may giue him that, which he 
craues or desires, or else take away such things as 
shall offend him: playing with him, kissing him, 
dancing him gently in her armes, and singing withall: 
and she must likewise open him often, to lay 
and keep him drie and cleane. 
 
[}Of the conditions which are required 
in good Milke.}] 
 
[/12./] 
THe choise of good Milke is, that it be of a middle 
substance, that is to say, such as shal be neither 
too watrish, nor too thicke: For that which is 
too watrish and thin, may cause the child to haue a 
scowring, and besides, it yeeldeth no good nutriment: 
And the Milke which is too thicke, is easily 
crudled, and not so soone digested, and so causeth 
obstructions, from whence the matter of the stone 
[/13./] 
is bred. As for the quantitie of Milke: a Nurse 
should rather haue too much, then too little: because 
when there is but little, it will be hard for the 
child to draw it; when as if there be plentie, it will 
[^p.6^] 
come the easier, and euen thrust out it selfe. Moreouer, 
if the child should sucke the breast drie; then 
that which shall come in the roome of it, cannot 
be well concocted so soone: Besides, if the child 
should chance to haue an Ague, then would he 
sucke, and consume a great deale. Againe, the 
Nurse besides a sufficient quantitie for the nourishing 
of the child, must haue some to milke into his 
eyes, if he should chance to haue any imperfection 
there: as either heat, pimples, or itching, that so 
it may be cooled. 
 
[/14./] 
As for the colour, it must be white, according to 
the common saying: (As white as Milke) for the 
Milke which is blewish, makes shew of Melancholy, 
as the yellow doth of Choller, and the reddish, 
that it is not well concocted, and signifies either 
that there is a weaknesse in the breasts, or else an ill 
qualitie of the bloud whereof it is made, which 
hath not been concocted and corrected by the naturall 
heat of the paps. 
 
[/15./] 
Besides, good Milke ought not to haue any strong 
smell, but rather a sweet sent, which smelleth neither 
hote, nor sower, nor yet adust, for such smels 
shew, that the bloud, of which it is made, is ouerheated 
or putride. 
 
[/16./] 
And concerning the Tast; that Milke which hath 
a sweet sauour is much commended: as contrarywise, 
that which is either sharp, sower, or bitter, is 
to be refused, and therefore not chosen for good. 
 
[/17./] 
Now the triall thereof may be made in this sort; 
as to know whether it be of a good substance: let 
[^p.7^] 
the nurse milke some few drops of it, vpon a looking 
glasse, or other sleeke thing: and if in holding it 
gently aside, it flows and runs presently, and keepe 
not together a little, then it is a signe that the milke 
is watrish, and too thinne, If it stand still, and will 
not runne at all, then it shews that the milke is too 
thicke and fat: But if it runne lasurely, not staying 
eyther too long, or flowing too soone, vpon the said 
smooth body: it sheweth that the milke is of a middle 
substance, and ought to bee reckoned and chosen 
for the beast. 
 
[/18./] 
The quantity of the milke may be knowne thus: 
if there remaine some in the breast after the childe 
hath done sucking: and againe, if in opening the 
child you find him bepissed: But you must haue an 
eye that your nurse be none of these Cooseners (for 
there be some) that giue the child water to drinke 
in secret, and others, which wet the childs bed: But 
such Nurses deserue to be whipt, and their knauery 
may be easily descried, both by the eye and the sent 
and likewise discerned by the tast. 
 
[/19./] 
Now the obseruation, which is taken from the 
Nurses child, for the choice of a fit Nurse, is concerning 
his age: For if her child be aboue seuen or 
eight months old, then her milke will bee too stale 
afterwards: and besides it would be a doubt, whether 
shee would haue milke enough to nurse him, 
that should be put vnto her. 
 
Againe, if the childe be but fifteene daies or a 
moneth olde, that shews, that her milke is too 
new, and that it is not as yet well purified: because 
[^p.8^] 
the mother is not wholly purged and clensed. 
 
[/20./] 
So Anicen commands, that a child should not be 
put to sucke a Woman, till at least two moneths 
after her deliuery; and at the farthest not after 
eight. 
 
And because the sexe of the Nurses child must 
likewise bee obserued, Aegineta wisheth, that it 
should be rather a man child then a maid child: because 
the milke is hotter, better concocted; and not 
so excrementitious; And he addeth farther, that it 
is fit (whether it be a boy or a wench) that the mother 
haue born her burthen, the full time. For those 
that are commonly deliuered, before their time, 
for the most part are not sound, but sickly: though 
there be many healthfull women, which goe with 
their children but seuen Moneths. 
 
[}How a Nurse ought to order her selfe, concerning her 
Dyet, and manner of life. 
 
CHAP. II.}] 
 
IT is not enough that a Nurse be indowed 
with the conditions and qualities aforesaid: 
but it is very fit also that shee 
maintaine and preserue them: wherefore 
wee will set downe briefely, how, and in what 
manner, she ought to gouerne her selfe. 
 
First of all therefore let her shun, and auoide all 
bad ayre, and all kind of ill and stinking smels: for 
[^p.9^] 
such sents as are too strong, are naught and hurtfull 
for her, because they infect and ouer-heat the spirits, 
[/21./] 
and bloud, whereof the milke is made: Shee 
must likewise auoide all meats, that are eyther too 
much salted, or spiced, or of a strong tast, as Onions, 
Leekes, Garlicke, Mustard, and all kind of Baked 
Meates, and old cheese: Let her eate Veale, Mutton, 
Chicken, Kid, Partridge, and such like meates 
which are of good iuice, and of easy digestion: and 
[/22./] 
she must vse them in moderate sort, without glutting 
her selfe. 
 
All sorts of fish are hurtfull for her, except it bee 
in small quantity: shee may eate Iacke, Sole, and 
Quauluer; and if she eat no fish let her vse new laid 
egges. 
 
Her meate must be rather boyled, then rosted, 
but yet there must be had a respect to the habitude 
and complexion of the child: For if hee bee very 
moist and flegmaticke, then the Nurse shall rather 
vse rostmeat: and so of other complexions. 
 
[/23./] 
Her bread shall be of good wheate, well made, 
light, and baked as it ought to be. 
 
[/24./] 
Let her put into her pottages, Lettuce, Sorrell, 
Purcelaine, Borage, Buglosse, and Succory. 
 
Shee shall refraine from all kind of raw fruits. 
 
[/25./] 
For her drinke, let her take Ale, or Beere; and 
where that cannot be had, Barley water; or water 
sodden; or else a small kind of Hydromel or meade 
which hath but a little Cinamon in it. 
 
But I would rather counsaile them, to drinke 
[/26./] 
Wine and Water together. Aristotle forbids wine, 
[^p.10^] 
both to the nurse and the child, except it be (as they 
say) well christned. 
 
[/27./] 
She must vse moderate exercise, and chiefly before 
meales: For moderate exercise doth strengthen 
the naturall heate, and consumeth all superfluities. 
The parts which ought to be most exercised, 
should be rather the vppermost, as the shoulders, 
and armes: because that the exercising of 
them, makes the bloud & spirits the sooner ascend 
into the breasts. 
 
[/28./] 
For her sleepe that cannot bee either limited or 
prescribed: because the Nurse is oftentimes constrained 
to watch, when the child is eyther froward 
or sicke. And therefore she must take her rest when 
she may, whether it be in the day, or in the night, 
as the child will giue her leaue. 
 
Her belly must be alwaies loose and if it chance 
to be bound, shee may take a Clister. Let her vse 
Broths, Prunes, and Apples well sodden, that so she 
may keepe her selfe soluble. 
 
She must shun all disquietnes of mind, and shee 
must be merry and pleasant, neyther vexing, nor 
grieuing, nor too chollericke. 
 
[}The care which a Nure must haue of all the 
parts of the childs body. 
 
CHAP. III.}] 
 
THe Nurse should be chosen a month or two 
before the woman be deliuered, that she may 
alwaies haue an eye ouer her, and her child, and 
[^p.11^] 
then as soone as the Woman shall bee brought abed, 
and that the childe hath passed through the 
hands of the Midwife, or keeper, and is swathed by 
them he shall be deliuered to the nurse to giue him 
sucke, and haue a care of him. 
 
First of all, let the Nurse consider and view al the 
parts of the childs body, beginning at the head, obseruing 
whether it be well fashioned or no: that if 
it chance to haue any ill forme, or figure; that then 
it may be mended as well as it may, which shall be 
[/29./] 
done by bringing the said head vnto the forme of a 
boule, a little pressed and made flat on both sides: 
in such sort that neyther the forepart, nor hinderpart 
of the head, stand too farre out, nor yet be too 
flat: which shall be done with such head-cloths, as 
they vse commonly to weare, stroking it by little 
and little, without much pressing or crushing it, as 
some Nurses do: but onely handling it in a milde 
and gentle fashion. 
 
Vpon the Mould of the head you shal lay a peece 
of kotton or kersey: some vse to lay a peece of scarlet. 
 
[/30./] 
The eares must bee cleansed: with little rags 
made like tents: and the Nurse must looke whether 
the holes be well made, that there may not remain 
any filth eyther within, or in the wrinkles and folds 
behind them. And as Rhasis saith, the eares must be 
a little pressed to the head, that they may not hang 
downe. 
 
Let the eares also bee wrapped about with fine 
linnen clouts, that they may not bee ouer heated, 
[^p.12^] 
and so sticke to the head, by the meanes of some 
grosse matter, or sweat which commonly is bredde 
there. 
 
[/31./] 
But aboue all, the eyes must be looked vnto and 
wiped with a fine linnen cloth, especially about 
both the corners, that if there should chance to be 
any filth gathered in those places, it may be taken 
away. Auicen puts there a little virgin oyle, because 
it mitigateth and taketh away the roughnesse and 
nitrosity which might remaine about the childs 
eyes, through his long swimming and lying in his 
owne sweat and Vrine, while he was in his mothers 
wombe. I haue seene in some children, that (after 
they haue bene borne) there hath runne out of the 
corner of the eye, many daies together thick drops 
of bloud, which congealed presently. There are many 
children likewise borne bleare ey'd, for the helping 
whereof, the Nurse shall vse to annoint the 
corners of the eyes with a little Vnguentum Tutiæ, 
and likewise spirt a little of her milke into them. 
 
[/32./] 
Now concerning the childs nose, it is fit, that it 
should be opened, and dilated gently, washing and 
cleansing it with a little warme water. The same 
Auicen bids, that it should bee annointed with a 
little Virgin Oyle, which must bee done with the 
top of ones finger, the nayles being pared very neer 
and euen. And if you chaunce to find some little 
membrane, or skinne, that stops vp the holes, and 
passage thereof, it shall be cut asunder, that there 
may bee a passage for the excrements of the 
braine. 
 
[^p.13^] 
And for as much as the head of a childe aboundeth 
with store of moisture, (as Galen writeth) 
which is purged and voided by the mouth, nose, 
and other passages: therefore it will be very fit that 
the Nurse haue a care to the taking of them away 
for feare lest by their stay, they eyther fall down vpon 
[/33./] 
the lungs, or into the stomacke, or else grow to 
be dryed, which happening the Nurse must put her 
finger being annointed with honey, to the bottom 
of the childs mouth, and rub it aboue and vnder the 
tongue, which shee may doe also with Sirup of 
Violets. 
 
Besides shee shall looke whether the fundament 
bee well opened, and whether there bee any filth 
bred there or no: as also, whether the passage of 
[/34./] 
the yard be free: and if it be a wench, whether there 
be any membrane, that doth stop vp the entrance: 
Not long since, I made a new passage in a little 
childe, who had the hole of his yard growne, and as 
it were glued together: and an other boy, which 
had the string of his yard so short and straight, that 
it made the head of it (called Balanus) bow downward, 
and seemed as though it had no passage, but 
as soone as I had cut the string, the yard came to 
the right fashion. 
 
And concerning the membrane which somtimes 
stops the passage: I haue made incision of the like 
membrans, in three girles, and lately in the daughter 
of M. Iames Boyzard. 
 
[/35./] 
As for the armes and legges, if they bee either 
crooked or stand awry, they must bee set sttaight 
[^p.14^] 
with little swaths, & fit boulsters, made for the purpose: 
as likewise if eyther the back bone, or the belly, 
do stand out. But for these they must repaire vnto 
a Chirurgion: who must shew and instruct the 
Nurse how she ought to proceed herein, when she 
shifts the child. 
 
Galen would haue vs, to looke to these deformities 
[/36./] 
betimes, because the bones (through their 
softnes & tendernes) are more easily made straight 
and are apter to be set in their right place & forme, 
then when they are growne dryer: it being then very 
hard to amend such errors, as the same Galen 
[/37./] 
saith. 
 
[}How the Nurse must shift the child. 
 
CHAP. IIII.}] 
 
WE must not onely haue a regard, to 
such defects of Nature, as the child 
may bring with him from his mothers 
wombe, and cure them: but we 
must also looke, and haue an eye, 
that the Nurse, or shee that swathes, and dresseth 
him, doe not make him worse: and of a well fashioned 
child, in all the parts of his body, do not make 
him deformed or mishapen, and so spoile him. For 
in swathing the child, most commonly they bind 
and crush him so hard, that they make him grow 
crooked. Some swath all the childs body hard to 
make him haue a goodly necke, and to make him 
[^p.15^] 
seeme the fatter: but this crushing makes his brest 
and the ribs which are fastned to the back bone, to 
stand out; so that they are bended, and draw the 
Vertebræ to them, which makes the backe bone, to 
bend and giue out eyther inwardly, or outwardly, 
or else on the one side: and that causeth the childe 
to be eyther crump-shouldred, or crooked brested, 
or else to haue one of his shoulders stand farther 
out then the other, some also bind the hips so hard 
that they become very smal, and that hinders them 
from growing and waxing big. Which doth much 
[/38./] 
harme, especially to maids, who should haue large 
hips, that when they come to age, they may bring 
foorth goodly children. 
 
[/39./] 
Galen hath obserued, that the too straight and 
hard binding or crushing of the hams, and legges of 
little children, when they are swathed, doth make 
them grow crooked legged and they will remaine, 
as the Latines call it Vari or Valgi; going either inward 
or outward with their knees. This imperfection 
may also happen through the Nurses fault, by 
carrying the childe alwaies vpon one arme, and 
the same side: and by holding the childs knees hard 
towards her, making them stand like a bow: For 
the preuenting of which mischances, the Nurses 
shall carry their children, sometimes on the right 
side, and sometimes on the left. And they must likewise 
swath them, but loosely, stretching downe 
their armes, all along their sides, without binding 
or crushing them hard together. 
 
[^p.16^] 
[}Of the childs cradle, and how it is to be placed; and 
also how the child ought to be laide 
when he goes to sleepe. 
 
CHAP. V.}] 
 
WHen the child shall bee thus dressed, 
and swathed, it will then be fit to let 
him sleepe and take some rest, for 
which purpose he must be laid in his 
cradle: fitted with a little mattresse, 
which shall be laid deepe to the bottome, that the 
sides of the cradle may be a great deale aboue the 
mattresse; that so the childe may as it were sinke 
downe in his cradle for feare least he fall out of it. 
[/40./] 
Then vpon the Mattresse shal be laid a pillow, that 
is somwhat soft, to lay the childe vpon, letting him 
lye the first month vpon his backe: but afterwards 
when hee is waxed a little bigger let him lye sometimes 
[/41./] 
on his right side, and sometimes on the left, 
hauing his head a little raised vp, that the excrements 
of his braine may the more easily flow and 
passe through the emunctoryes thereof: And hee 
must bee bound and tyed in with strings, least in 
rocking him, he fall out of his Cradle. At the head 
of the Cradle let there bee a little Arch made of 
wood, or Ozier to lay a couerlet ouer it, thereby to 
keepe away the wind, and that no dust fall vpon 
him. But it would be more conuenient (for those 
that can fitly haue it) to set the Cradle within a little 
[^p.17^] 
bed, the Curteynes drawne round about it. 
 
[/42./] 
Now, concerning the place where the Cradle 
must stand, it will be verie fit, that it be in a chamber 
that is neither too light, nor to darke, nor too 
hote, nor too cold: For if it be too light, it spends 
the spirits of the sight, and hindreth the child from 
sleeping: and if it be too darke, it makes him desire the 
light, and causes him to be melancholike: if it be 
too hote, it will stifle him, & make him apt to catch 
cold, when he comes into the aire: if it be too cold, 
it brings him to a murre, or stopping in the head: 
and therefore it will be best to keep a meane in all 
of them: And especially you must haue a care, that 
the Cradle, and bed, stand not neare the dore, 
chimney, or windowes, that the light do not draw 
the childs sight awrie, and so make him prooue to 
be squint-ey'd: and therefore the fire, or the candle 
must be set right against his eyes: For if they were 
on either side, the glimpse will make the child turne 
and role his eye aside, to follow the light, and so the 
vse and motion, which the Muscles would get therby, 
may make him either squint or goggle-ey'd. 
 
Oftentimes the child cannot sleep after he is laid 
downe, and therefore he must be gently rock'd, to 
inuite him thereto, and not hastily or too fast, for 
feare of making the milke flote in his stomacke; and 
his Nurse shall sing by him, because singing prouokes 
sleepe, and keepes him from crying. 
 
Till the childe be two yeere old, he may sleepe 
at all times whensoeuer he will, yea he may fall asleepe 
at his mothers teat as hee is sucking: and if 
[^p.18^] 
you would obserue the space of time for sleeping 
which the Ancients did, it must be thus: Till the 
childe be three or foure yeeres old, let him sleepe 
more then wake. But according to Galen, he ought 
heerein not to exceed mediocritie, otherwise it is 
dangerous: for long sleeping cooleth and moistneth 
the braine, and there retaines superfluities. 
And Auicen saith, that it doth be-numme and besot 
the childs senses, and makes him dull and lumpish. 
 
[}When the Mother her selfe, or the Nurse, ought to 
giue the child sucke, and how, and how much. 
 
CHAP. VI.}] 
 
IT is verie fit that either the Mother, 
or some other Nurse for her, do giue 
the child sucke after he is borne: if it 
be the Mother her selfe, it must not 
be at the soonest, vntill eight daies 
after her deliuerie: Some also are of opinion, that 
the mother her selfe, should not giue her child 
sucke in the month, by reason she hath been troubled 
and tir'd in her lying in: and because she is not 
as yet, well cleans'd and purified of her after-purgings, 
which commonly last a moneth, as Hippocrates 
saith: In which space she shall let little prettie 
whelpes sucke her breasts, to make her milke 
come the better, and that it goe not away. 
 
Some women do make their keepers draw their 
breasts, and others draw them with glasses themselues: 
[^p.19^] 
Besides, Auicen commands, that a woman 
should not giue her child sucke, vntill she be well 
recouer'd. Now, you know that some are well 
sooner, and some later, and so there can be no time 
limited or prescribed: But aboue all it must be obserued, 
(as the same Authour saith) that the Nurse 
do not giue the child sucke, after she is risen, before 
she hath milked foorth some of her milke: And 
likewise, she shall not giue him the breast, if by 
chance she hath ouer heated her selfe, either by 
some exercise, or else with going, till first she be 
come into a good temper, and well cool'd. 
 
[/43./] 
Now, in giuing him sucke, she shall obserue this 
order: She must sometimes spirt some of her milke, 
either vpon the childs lips, or else into his mouth; 
and when he hath left the nipple, she must crush 
her breast a little, that he may draw and sucke with 
lesse labour, and she must be carefull, that he swallow 
not downe too much at a time, and that the 
milke come not out againe at the nose: Besides, 
she must sometimes take away the teat, and giue 
it him againe, that he sucke not too much at once, 
and too greedily. 
 
[/44./] 
It is verie hard to set downe, the quantitie of 
milke that a child should take; But therein the 
nurse must haue a respect to the age, complexion, 
temper, and to the desire which the child hath to 
sucke, increasing it, as the child groweth, or according 
as he is thirstie, either through some sicknesse, 
or when his teeth come foorth: for at those times 
he is more drie, then otherwise. Now to know how 
[^p.20^] 
often the child should sucke in a day: Paulus Ægineta 
appoints, that it should be twise a day, or thrise 
at the most: which he meaneth for the first foure, 
or fiue daies, that he may be acquainted therewith 
by little and little, and also because there is then no 
great need. I haue seen children that haue not sucked 
in two or three daies, after they were borne; 
for they know not then, whether they are yet in 
their Mothers belly, or no: where they suck'd not 
[/45./] 
at all; although that Hippocrates saith, that the child 
receiues some nourishment by the mouth, while 
he is in his Mothers belly. It can neither be told 
nor limitted how often he ought to sucke in a day; 
because it is fit he should haue the teat, as often 
as he crieth: yet let it be but a little at a time, because 
the stomacke at first is but weake. And if he 
wrangles but a little, it will be best to still him, 
either with rocking, or singing: And though he 
be not quieted, or stilled, a little crying can doe 
him no great harme, but rather may serue for 
some good vse: For it makes him runne at Nose, 
shed teares, and spit: it purgeth his braine, yea, and 
stirreth vp his naturall heat, and also dilates the passages 
of the breast. But if he cry too violently, and 
eagerly, it may do him much harm, and cause him 
to be bursten, or breake some vessel in his breast, or 
else bring the head-ach. 
 
[^p.21^] 
[}How the child must be made cleane, after he is 
awake and vnswathed. 
 
CHAP. VII.}] 
 
AFter the Child hath well suck'd, and 
slept, the Nurse must shift him, and 
make him cleane: For which purpose 
the Nurse, or some other, must sit 
neere the fire, laying out her legges 
at length, hauing a soft pillow in her lap, the dores 
and windowes being close shut, and hauing something 
about her, that may keep the wind from the 
child. And when she is thus accommodated, she 
shall vnswath and shift him drie. If he be verie 
foule, she may wash him with a little water and 
wine luke warme, with a spunge or linnen cloth. 
 
The time of shifting him is commonly about seuen 
a clocke in the morning, then againe at noone, 
and at seuen a clocke at night: and it would not 
be amisse, to change him againe about midnight; 
which is not commonly done. But because there is 
no certaine howre, either of the childs sucking, or 
sleeping: therefore diuers, after he hath slept a 
good while, do euery time shift him: least he should 
foule and bepisse himselfe. And surely there be many 
children, that had need to be shifted, as soone 
as they haue foul'd themselues: which I would 
counsaile you to doe, and not to let them lie in 
their filth. 
 
[^p.22^] 
When you change his bed, you shall rub all his 
bodie ouer, with an indifferent fine linnen cloth: 
and then his head must be rub d, and made cleane: 
and when he is foure or fiue moneth old, his head 
may be cleans'd with a fine brush: and when he is 
growen bigger, let it be comb'd. 
 
[}What cloths and coats the child must haue, 
and at what time. 
 
CHAP. VIII.}] 
 
AS soone as the childe is somewhat 
growne, and that hee cannot well 
keepe his hands swathed in, and hid 
any longer, (which is commonly about 
the twentieth or thirtieth day, 
according as he is in strength) then must hee haue 
little sleeues, that hauing his armes and hands at 
liberty, hee may vse and stirre them: and then the 
Nurse shall begin to carry him abroad, so that it 
be faire weather, to sport and exercise him, not carrying 
him out into the raine, or into the hot sunne, 
nor when there is any rough wind. 
 
And therfore he must be kept in the shade auoiding 
all ill ayres, as of sinkes and the like: And if 
he should chance to bee frighted with any thing, 
the Nurse shal endeuor to take away the apprehension 
thereof, and harten him, without making him 
afraid. I haue seen some children, that with a fright, 
haue fallen into the Epilepsye or falling sicknes, the 
[^p.23^] 
Physitions not being able to giue any other reason 
thereof, but onely the feare he had taken. 
 
If by chance he doth cry and weepe, then shall 
you endeuour by all meanes to still him, and not let 
him cry, obseruing diligently what it is he cries for, 
and what may be the cause thereof: that as Gal _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n 
saith, he may haue that he desireth, or else be ridde 
of that which offends and troubleth him. 
 
[/46./] 
But the same Author saith, that children generally 
are stilled and quieted by three meanes: by 
giuing them the breast, by rocking, and by singing 
to them: They may be also stilled by giuing them 
something to holde in their hand, or by making 
them looke vpon somwhat that pleaseth them, as 
also by carrying them abroad. 
 
About the eighth, or ninth month, or at farthest 
when the child is a yeare old, he must haue coates, 
and not be kept swathed any longer. And if it bee 
Sommer, he must be coated sooner because of the 
heate, which makes the body oftentimes, to be full 
of wheales and pimples. And some may haue coats 
sooner, according as their strength will suffer it; of 
which an especiall care must be had. And chiefly 
the Nurse must let him haue a hat, that may be easie 
and large enough, which may couer all the forepart 
of the head, without beeing curious (as they 
say commonly) to make him haue a goodly high 
forhead. 
 
[^p.24^] 
[}At what age the child may take other sustenance 
beside Milke. 
 
CHAP. IX.}] 
 
THe childe must bee nourished with 
[/47./] 
 
milk only, till his foreteeth be come 
forth both aboue, and beneath: as 
Galen writeth: for beeing nothing 
[/48./] 
else yet but as it were milke it is very 
fit and probable that hee should bee nourished 
with no other foode: Besides the teeth are chiefly 
ordained by nature, onely to chaw: and therefore 
when he hath none, he ought not to be fed with any 
solide meat. But as soone as they are come forth 
it sheweth that Nature hath giuen him those instruments, 
to make vse of them: and therefore hee 
may then take more solide meate, if you thinke he 
can digest it. For to giue him any other nourishment, 
then milke or dish-meate, before hee haue 
teeth, it might breede great store of crude humors, 
and winds, which oftentimes (as Auicen saith) doe 
cause the child to haue bunches, or contusions, about 
his backe bone, and ribs. Neuerthelesse, 
though his teeth bee come, yet must you not giue 
him meat, that is too solide, or in too great quantitie: 
but at the beginning, you may giue him sops of 
bread, or Panado, or Gruell: afterward he may suck 
the leg of a Chicken, the greatest part of the flesh 
being taken away, that he may the better pull, and 
[^p.25^] 
gnaw it, and this is but once or twice a day, & that 
too, when he is almost ready to be weaned (as Rhasis 
saith.) And this also doth serue to whet and rub his 
gummes which about that time begin to itch. And 
when hee is fifteene moneths olde, or a little more, 
then may you giue him the flesh of a Capon, or of 
Partridge minced and mingled with some broth, 
made either of Veale, Mutton, or Chicken, adding 
thereto some sops of bread. For the Ancient 
writers forbid, that wee should giue them any 
store of meate, before they are two yeares old: because 
they are not able to chaw, and digest it, and 
also for that they haue not so much neede of nourishment; 
And therefore you must stay till you haue 
weaned him, before you feede him more plentifully. 
 
[}When the child ought to be weaned. 
 
CHAP. X.}] 
 
IT is a very hard thing to set downe a 
certaine time, when a child ought to 
be weaned; Notwithstanding if we wil 
beleeue Paulus Aegineta, and Auicen, 
he must be weaned, when he is two yeares old, and 
hath all his teeth come foorth. Now in some they 
come foorth sooner, and in others later: and to 
weane him before they are come foorth, might be 
an occasion, to make him haue many diseases. 
 
Wherefore to know certainely when a childe 
[^p.26^] 
should be weaned, and that he should wholy feed 
vpon other meat, it must first be obserued, whether 
he take his meat well; and if hee be able to chaw it 
thoroughly: whether he be sickly or else strong and 
lusty. 
 
Concerning the time and season of the yeare 
it must be when the wether is neither too hot, nor 
too cold: and therfore the fittest time will be the 
spring or in Autumn. But somtimes there is necessity 
to wean him at another time, yea & before two 
yeares, by reason that his nurse may chance to bee 
sickly, and that he being come to some knowledge 
will not sucke another. It may also happen that the 
child is to be weaned before he be two yeares, old 
for that the milke (although otherwise it bee good) 
doth curdle and grow sower in his stomacke, which 
requireth stronger meate. 
 
Now to weane a childe well, let them obserue 
this methode following: First the teat shall not be 
wholy taken from him, but hee shall sucke a little, 
and eate a little meate; and so continue for a few 
daies: then afterwards hee shall not sucke in the 
day time, though in the night, they may giue him 
a little. Neuerthelesse, it will be very fit in the morning, 
when he is awake and hath been shifted and 
dressed, to giue him sucke a little, and then to let 
him stay two or three houres before hee take any 
thing, afterward to giue him somwhat to dinner, as 
some pottage, or panade, with a little flesh minced, 
or cut very small, and then let him stay two houres 
without giuing him any thing, at which time you 
[^p.27^] 
may giue him a little sucke, and lay him to sleepe: 
And when hee is wakened and hath beene made 
cleane, then the Nurse shall carry him abroad into 
the aire, if it be faire wether, and giue him sucke, 
and then lay him to sleepe againe, without letting 
him eate any solide meate, or very little. At his dinner 
they shal giue him to drinke a little boyled water: 
[/49./] 
and this order shall bee kept a whole moneth, 
and when hee shall bee accustomed to eate solide 
meate then the teate shall bee quite taken from 
him. 
 
It happens oftentimes that the child will not forsake 
the breasts, but still cryeth and is very eager after 
it, and then you must make him loath it, annointing 
the Nurses breast with Mustard, or else rubbing 
the top of the nipple with a little Aloes, and 
likewise make him ashamed of it. 
 
[}Of the diseases which happen to a child. 
 
CHAP. XI.}] 
 
HItherto we haue shewed what manner 
of Woman a Nurse ought to be, 
and how she should Nurse and giue 
her child sucke, it now resteth that 
wee speake of some diseases, which 
happen vnto children in their first age, which is 
from their birth, to the seuenth month, in which 
time, they commonly haue their first teeth, then 
afterwards those which happen in their second age 
[^p.28^] 
which is from the seuenth month, to the end of two 
yeares, at which time they commonly are weaned, 
and their teeth are almost quite come foorth: leauing 
the third age, which is from two yeares, to seuen: 
and the fourth also, which is reckoned from seuen 
years to fourteene. 
 
[/50./] 
Hippocrates hath obserued in his Aphorismes, 
that children, when they are young, are subiect to 
these diseases: to a sorenes of the mouth, with little 
whelks which doe rise theron, and vpon the tongue 
called by him Aphthæ, to vomiting, the Cough, 
watchings, or forsaking of sleepe, inflammation of 
the Nauell, and moisture of the eares. And in their 
[/51./] 
second age (which is when their teeth begin to 
come) they are troubled with itching of the gums 
and chiefely when the dog teeth come foorth, and 
those are most troubled therewithall, which are 
more fat, and fleshy, and which are bound in 
their belly. But because there are many other diseases 
that they are subiect vnto, whether it be that 
they bring them from their mothers wombe, with 
them, or that they happen to them afterwards: 
therefore I will briefly speak of them all, beginning 
first with those that doe most trouble them. 
 
[}How some diseases may happen vnto little Children in 
comming foorth of their mothers wombe. 
 
CHAP. XII.}] 
 
THere be diuers accidents which happen vnto 
little children, and at their time of comming 
[^p.29^] 
into the world. Some receiuing bruises, and hurts, 
either in the head or other parts of their body, 
through striuing and straining in the deliuery; as 
Aches, or breaking of an arme, leg, or thigh: which 
I haue often seene in a difficult trauaile. The latter 
must be helped by setting the bones againe in their 
right place, whether it bee that they were out of 
ioint, or else broken, and then bind them, and keepe 
them so till they be well grown together, and haue 
taken firme hold. 
 
As for hurts and bruises, they must bee bathed 
with some fomentation, made of Roses, Melilot, & 
Chamomil flowers, and then annointed with Saint 
Iohns Wort and Roses, mingled together. 
 
Mad. Maheu was deliuered of a childe so bruised 
and torne, that euery one iudged him to bee dead, 
hee was so blacke: whom I dressed and looked vnto, 
& with the foresaid medicine I healed him perfectly. 
But the worst is, when there happeneth any 
hurt about the childs head, by meanes whereof, 
there comes some great swelling tumor, full of 
bloud, which may be taken improperly for the Hydrocephalo. 
If it be but small, then it may bee resolued 
with the former fomentation and liniment and 
some plasters of Diacalciteos, and Diachilon Ireatum 
mingled together. But if the swelling be much 
and big, then must we not think to heale it by resolution, 
as Master Pietræ, & I my selfe saw a Chirurgion, 
who was very confident, and did assure himselfe, 
to make it resolue only with new waxe spread 
and laid vpon it. But in the end we were constrained 
[^p.30^] 
to launce the humor, and in few daies, it was 
perfectly healed vnder my hands. 
 
[}Of the greatnesse and swelling of the head 
which happens to little 
Children. 
 
CHAP. XIII.}] 
 
IT chaunceth oftentimes, that the 
childs head after he is born, is bigger 
then naturally it ought to bee, an accident 
which is very dangerous, and 
hard to be cured: whereof there bee 
three kinds. 
 
The first is called of the Greekes, Macrocephalos, 
which is, when the head is bigger then naturally it 
should be: and yet this comes naturally, as when 
the bones of the head bee large, and of great compasse 
containing great store of brayne, and proportioned 
to the compasse and circuit of them, there 
being neither winde, nor waters, nor any other humors, 
that are the cause thereof. Nature hauing 
thus proportioned it: and it is so heauy and vnwildy, 
that the child cannot hold it vpright, his necke 
beeing constrained to bow vnder it, with the very 
waight, so that it had neede to bee prop't vp with 
some thing or other: Now there is contrary to this 
another which is called Microcephalos that is a little 
head, such a one had Thersites the Grecian and one 
Triboulet who was a French man. Both these accidents 
[^p.31^] 
are very hard to bee cured, yea almost impossible. 
 
The second kind is called Hydrocephalos, which 
is, when the head becomes big, by reason of some 
waters therein contained. Of the which there are 
diuers sorts: for either the waters are contained betweene 
the skin, and the Pericraneum; or betwixt 
the Pericraneum and the bone; or betweene the 
bone and the membranes, called Dura mater, and 
Pia mater: Some of them are particular, and possesse 
but onely one part of the head; others are generall 
and affect it wholy. 
 
[/52./] 
Some of them haue their spring and beginning, 
euen from the Mothers wombe: which hapneth 
when the Mother, while shee was with childe, 
through an ill Diet, gathered store of crudities and 
raw humours, whereof there is bred a watrish and 
flegmatike bloud, with the which the child being 
fed, and not being able to digest, or consume it, 
much lesse to euacuate and void it by the passages 
appointed by nature, the watrish matter gathers it 
selfe together in the head. 
 
It may also proceed from the child, being not 
well purg'd of the superfluities which are gathered 
in his braine, and diffused ouer all the head, or part 
thereof: whereunto we may adde the ill nourishment 
which the child receiueth from his Nurse, 
whose milke is either serous and watrish, or ouerheated, 
which causeth diuers vapours, to ascend 
vp into the braine, which are there conuerted into 
watrish humors. 
 
[^p.32^] 
The third kind is called Phisocephalos, when there 
chanceth to be a wind, which runneth betweene 
the skin of the head, and the bone; and also betweene 
the skull, and dura mater; which causeth 
the head to be so swolne, and puft vp, (as Auicen 
saith) that there haue been diuers children which 
haue dyed of it; the bones of the head being verie 
much thrust outward, which is verie painfull: And 
certainly, there is nothing that causeth greater 
distention, or more paine, then when there is 
some wind inclosed, in what part soeuer it be of 
the bodie. 
 
The watrie swelling hath almost the like causes, 
by reason of some watrish matter, that is bred in 
the braine, which through the weaknesse of the 
naturall heat, cannot well be dispersed, and so it is 
turned into wind: or else through some vapours, 
which arise from the neather parts, which do also 
distend, and stretch out the parts of the head. 
 
They are all of them different one from another: 
for the Macrocephalos, or great headed, yeelds not 
any impression when it is crush'd, because it is the 
bones which make it so big and swolne: but in the 
watrish swelling, the finger enters easily, and leaues 
an impression as an OEdema doth: But if you presse 
the windy swelling, it leaues no marke, or print, 
but presently it riseth vp againe like a foot-ball. 
 
Now, to know whether the water be contained 
betwixt the bones of the head, and the membranes 
of the braine: it may easilie be discerned by the 
paine, and by the accidents: as if there happen any 
[^p.33^] 
Vertigo, or Epilepsy, to the child, and that he sleep, 
little, or not at all; as also his continuall crying 
doth witnesse it. 
 
[/53./] 
The Cure of the windie swelling shall be performed, 
by appointing the Nurse to keep a good 
Diet, vsing meates that shall neither breed wind, 
nor crudities. 
 
[/54./] 
Concerning outward medicines, it is good to 
vse Fomentations: for such kind of medicines surely 
may do him verie much good, if the wind be 
contain'd between the skin, and the Pericraneum, 
or betwixt the Pericraneum, and the skull. But if 
the said wind be inclosed betweene the skull, and 
dura mater, it will be a verie difficult disease to be 
cured, (except the wind be but in small quantitie.) 
The Fomentation is this.

[^p.34^] 
[/57./] 
As for the watrish swelling, according to the 
quantitie, and qualitie of the humour that makes 
it, and the place where in the said humour is contained, 
it will be either easie or hard to be cured: 
for if the humour be thin, and in small quantitie, 
and that it be contained betweene the skin, and the 
Pericraneum, or else betweene the Pericraneum, and 
the skull, or betweene the membranes of the skull; 
[/58./] 
then Auicen makes a doubt, whether it can be 
cured. 
 
But if it be curable, the best way will be to vse 
the Fomentations and Plasters following: which 
haue power to digest, and drie vp the said watrishnesse.

You must likewise applie the Magistrall emplaster 
de Bettonica. Some take Snayles, shels and all, 
and beat them, putting vnto them a little powder 
of Bettonie, and of the rootes of Ireos. 
 
And if these medicines profit not, as indeed it is 
verie hard they should: then must you determine 
to open it. 
 
[^p.35^] 
The ancient Writers, as Rhasis, makes no question 
to applie thereto some gentle Cautery; others 
do rather counsaile, that it should be open'd with 
a launcet: For mine owne part, I haue practiz'd 
both waies, without any ill accident, when that 
the waters haue been contained betweene the 
skin, and the Pericranium, or betweene the Pericranium 
and the skull: But to say the truth, when 
the water is betweene the bones, and the membranes 
of the braine; though my selfe I haue been 
verie carefull in dressing of it: and not long since, 
being ioined with Mons. Pietre, a sworne Chirurgion 
of Paris; yet the successe hath not been according 
as we desir'd; And therefore, the cure of it 
must not be taken in hand, but with foretelling of 
the danger. 
 
[}Other imperfections, that accompanie the Child, when 
he is borne: as excrescences of flesh, the roofe 
of the mouth cleft, a hare lip, and 
supernumerarie fingers. 
 
CHAP. XIIII.}] 
 
WEe see many times, that the Child 
brings with him into the world diuers 
other imperfections, and effects: As 
I saw a child of one Peter Ferot, who 
had a little piece of flesh, which hung 
in the middle of his chin, like vnto a little sausage, 
of the bignesse of a quill, and halfe as long: and I 
[^p.36^] 
tyed it about with a thread, and cured it quickly. 
I did the like also another time, being accompanied 
with Mons. Portall, to a sonne of Mons. de Saint 
Gille, who had as it were a little cherrie hanging at 
the end of his eare. 
 
I haue seen three little children newly borne,

(and among the rest, I saw one, being with Mons. 
Hautin of Paris, ordinarie Physicion to the King, 
who was the sonne of Mons. de Cheury:) all these 
three children had the roofe of their mouth cleft 
and diuided, euen to the bottome of the Nose: by 
meanes whereof they could not sucke: because it 
is necessarie for one that will sucke well, to haue the 
aire closed in the mouth, and not to be dissipated 
and lost: which a child that hath a cleft pallet, cannot 
do: because the aire doth spread it selfe abroad, 
and gets out by the pallet of the mouth and the 
nose. Neuerthelesse, I haue seen little children, 
that haue been nourish'd by a sucking bottle, the 
space of two or three moneths: but at length they 
haue died: because the milke ran out by the nose, 
it being a verie hard thing, to make an artificiall 
pallet, that should keep it from going foorth: Neuerthelesse, 
I would counsaile the Chirurgion to 
make one, and to fit it with a little spunge tyed to 
it, which shall be put handsomely into the said cleft 
with the pallet: and it must be put in when the 
child would sucke, and then taken out againe when 
he hath done. And this haue I practized with good 
successe. 
 
[/62./] 
The clouen Lip, called a hare lip, doth often 
[^p.37^] 
happen vnto children: but the chiefest point is, to 
know whether it should be cured betimes, or else 
stay longer before it be taken in hand. I was once 
present at a Consultation, for a great Lords sonne, 
who was brought hither from beyond the Sea, for 
me to take him in hand, and cure him: Sixe Physicions 
and Chirurgions were of opinion, that the 
cure should be defer'd longer, (because the child 
was not aboue foure or fiue moneths old.) Notwithstanding, 
it was put in practize contrarie to 
their opinion, but the childs life was indangered 
thereby: And to say the truth, it is fitter to prolong 
and defer the practize of it, vntill the child 
haue some more discretion: for otherwise there is 
danger, least the points of the needles be broken, 
either by the childs crying, or sucking, or else in rubbing 
[/63./] 
himselfe: as I haue knowen it happen vnto 
some, their flesh being verie soft and tender: Besides, 
the operation is hard to be done, by reason of 
the childs impatience, hauing no discretion, or 
knowledge, (the which hapned to the foresaid 
Lord:) And also, for that it growes not a whit the 
worse, for the deferring it, till the child haue more 
vnderstanding and iudgement. 
 
[/64./] 
If the child should haue a finger, or a toe, aboue 
the ordinarie number, as there be some which haue 
sixe, whether it be in the hand, or on the feet: this 
deformitie hapning, I thinke it best, that it be taken 
away, as soone as the child is growen any thing 
[/65./] 
big: Which I haue done, to an honest Gentle-womans 
sonne, who had two thumbes, which came 
[^p.38^] 
vnto him, as his Mother told me, by marking and 
beholding earnestly her Vintager, who had two 
thumbes, as he told money into her hand when she 
reckoned with him, whereat she tooke an exceeding 
pleasure, and delight, to see him wagge the 
said thumbes, in that manner. 
 
[}Of the diseases which happen in the Eies, Eares, and 
Nose, of little Children. 
 
CHAP. XV.}] 
 
MOST commonly little Children, when 
they are newly borne, are subiect to diuers 
diseases, which chaunce in their 
eies, eares, nose, mouth Nauell, and other 
parts of their bodies, as we will shew heereafter 
in briefe. 
 
[/66./] 
Concerning those that happen in their eies; I 
referre the young Chirurgion to my booke of the 
diseases of the eies, which I wrote on that subiect. 
But because, that for the most part they are troubled 
with watering, and bloud-shot eies, it will not 
bee amisse in this case, that the Nurse sprinkle him 
some of her milke, to make him open his eies, and 
take away the gumme that holdeth them together. 
She may likewise wash them with a little rose 
water, and Plantaine water warm'd, and shall annoint 
the lids and corners of his eies, morning and 
euening with a little Vnguentum Tutiæ well made 
& prepared; for this ointment hath power through 
[^p.39^] 
his oylines, to keepe the eyelids from sticking and 
gluing together, to strengthen them and take away 
any inflammation that may happen there. 
 
[/67./] 
Oftentimes the Nose of little Children is so stopped 
with filth and matter which is dryed, that they 
can scarcely fetch breath thereby. This accident 
doth much trouble them, especially when they 
sucke, and it makes them oftentimes swallow their 
spittle, and breath with paine: when this chanceth, 
the Nurse must moisten the inside of the nose, with 
fine soft linnen tents, rubd ouer with some Vnguentum 
Rosatum, or Pomatum, or for want of these, she 
shall take a little of the seething of the pot, and 
make him snift it vp into his nose (if he haue discretion 
to do it.) 
 
[/68./] 
Likewise the eares of little children do commonly 
runne as well within as without, which happeneth 
because naturally their braine is very moist, 
and besides there arise many vapors from the entrailes 
into the head, which fills their braine with 
moisture, and that runne and flows by the eares: 
and therefore the Nurse must haue a care to keepe 
cleane the childs eares, as well within as without, 
and behind them: dropping into them gently 
now and then, two or three drops of oile of bitter 
Almonds, with a little Honey of Roses, a little 
warm'd. And if there be any fretting or excoriation 
behind and about the eares: then the nurse shal 
lay on them handsomely, fine linnen plasters, handsomely, 
fine little plasters, made with an ointment 
composed of white waxe, and oyle of Nuts. 
 
[^p.40^] 
Towards the hinder part of the eares, about the 
bottome of them, there happens oftentimes swellings 
which the Ancients call Parotides, and the 
French Orillons: when these happen, they must bee 
rub'd with oyle of sweet Almonds, laying vppon it 
a little quilt made of carden cotten, or fatty wooll 
basted betweene fine linnen clothes. 
 
And the better to resolue the said swelling you 
may adde to it a little oyle of Chamomile, and Lillies. 
If these swellings come to suppuration, they 
must be dressed as other impostumes be, not vsing 
thereto any repercussiue medicines.
