[^f.11v^] 
[}After what maner and fasshyon the byrthe 
lyethe in the mothers wombe, and 
howe many caules it is compassed 
and wrapped in. 
Cap. i.}] 
 
IN so muche as oure entent is 
in this boke folowynge to entreate 
and speake of the byrthe 
of mankynde/ aud of suche 
thynges whiche happen and 
chaunse to the mother in her labor and trauayle/ 
in the deliueraunce of the same/ it shal 
be fyrst verye necessary to shewe after what 
maner and fasshyon the infant lyeth in the 
mothers wombe/ and in howe many caules 
the same is lapped and wrapped: to the 
farther knowlege and perceuerance of suche 
thynges the whiche we shall entreate of 
hereafter. 
 
wherfore ye shall vnderstande that the 
byrth lyeth in the mother after this maner: 
Fyrste it lyeth rownde in maner as a bowle 
the handes beynge betwene the knees/ and 
the hedde lenyng on the knees: eyther of the 
eyes ioynynge vppon eyther of the knees: 
the ryghte eye vppon the ryghte knee: and 
[^f.12r^] 
the lefte vpon the lefte/ the noose dependyng 
betwene the knees/ so that the face and foreparte 
of the infante is towarde the inwarde 
partes of the woman/ lyenge in maner vpryght 
in the mothers matryce. 
 
Farther ye muste vnderstande that there 
be thre coueres or caules in the whiche the 
byrthe is contayned and lapped: of the whiche 
the one compassyth & embrasyth rownd 
aboute the byrthe/ and the other two caules 
also: and it is called the secondyne seconde 
byrth or the after byrthe: the whiche defendeth 
the byrthe frome noysum and yll humours 
encreasynge in the matryce after conception 
by retensyon of the flowres otherwyse 
wonte to passe and yssue furthe ones 
in the monethe/ the whiche yll humours yf 
they sholde touche or come nere to the byrth 
wolde greatlye peryshe and hurte the same. 
But after the deliueraunce of the pryncipall 
byrth these humours also with the foresayd 
caule or secondyne yssue furthe/ and is called 
the after byrthe. 
 
The seconde caule with the whiche the 
byrth is coueryd/ compasseth the same byrth 
frome the nauyll downewarde/ couerynge 
[^f.12v^] 
all the inferyour partes of the infant/ and 
this skynne or caule is as it were fulle of 
plyghtes and wrynkles: and through this 
caule the byrthe is defended and kepte from 
yll and sharpe humours as vryne or pysse 
yssuynge frome the infante and swette. &c. 
for so longe as the chylde is in the mothers 
wombe it sendeth furthe vrine/ not by the 
due membres but by the vayne whiche procedeth 
out of the nauell. 
 
The thyrde shynne or caule lykewyse contayneth 
all the byrthe in it defendynge also 
the same frome humours & vryne: and from 
the boystesnes of the secondyne or fyrst caule 
and this is called the armoure or defence of 
the byrthe. 
 
This is the maner of the sytuation and 
lodgyng of the infante in the mothers 
bellye: and these be the thre 
caules contaynynge and 
enclosyng in the byrth. 
Nowe wyll we 
speake of the 
tyme of 
byrthe. 
 
[^f.13r.^] 
[}Of the tyme of byrthe, and whiche 
is called naturall or vnnaturall. 
Cap. ii.}] 
 
ANd when the tyme of byrthe approchyth 
nere/ moste commenly 
these sygnes folowyng come before: 
by the which the tyme of labor 
is knowen to be at hande. 
 
Fyrste certayne dolours and paynes begynne 
to growe about the guttes/ the nauell/ 
and in the raynes of the backe/ and lykewyse 
aboute the thyghes & the other places beinge 
nere to the priuy partes/ which lykewyse then 
beginneth to swell and to burne and to expell 
humours/ so that it gyueth playne and euident 
token that the labor is nere. 
 
But ye shall note that there is two manner 
of byrthes/ the one called naturall/ the other 
contrarye to nature. Naturall byrthe is 
when the chylde is borne bothe in due season 
& also in due fashion. The due season is most 
commenlye after the .ix. moneth or aboute .xl. 
wekes after the conception/ althoughe some 
be delyuered sometymes in the seuenthe moneth/ 
and the chylde proueth verye well. But 
such as are borne in the eyght moneth/ other 
[^f.13v^] 
they be dead before the byrth/ or els lyue not 
longe after/ as the noble medicine Auicenna 
doth testifye. 
 
The due fashion of byrthe is this/ accordynge 
as wytnesseth Albert the greate/ fyrste 
the head commeth forwarde/ then foloweth 
the necke and shouldes/ the armes with the 
handes lyenge close to the bodye towarde the 
fete/ the face and forepart of the chylde beyng 
towardes the face and foreparte of the mother/ 
as it appeareth in the fyrste of the byrthe 
fygures. For as Albertus writeth/ and as we 
haue rehersed before also/ before the tyme of 
delyueraunce the chylde lyeth in the mothers 
wombe the face and breste beynge towardes 
the backe of the mother/ but when it sholde be 
delyuered/ it is torned clene contrary/ the head 
downewarde/ the fete vpwarde/ and the face 
towarde the mothers bellye/ and that yf the 
byrth be natural. Another thyng also is this/ 
that yf the byrthe be naturall/ the delyuerance 
is easye withoute longe taryenge or lokynge 
for it. 
 
The byrth contrarye to nature is/ when 
the mother is delyuered before her tyme/ or 
oute of due season/ or after any other fashion 
[^f.14r^] 
then is here specyfyed before/ as when bothe 
legges procede fyrste/ or one alone/ with both 
the handes vp/ or both downe/ other elles the 
one vp & the other downe/ and diuers otherwise 
as shalbe hereafter more clerely declared 
 
[}Of easye, and vneasye, difficull, or dolorous 
delyueraunce, and the causes of it, with 
the sygnes howe to knowe, and 
forese the same. 
Cap. iii.}] 
 
VEry many be the parelles/ dangerous 
& stronges which chanse 
to women in theyr labor/ whiche 
ensue & come in dyuers wayes/ & 
for dyuers causes/ such as I shal 
here declare. 
 
Fyrst when the woman that laboreth is 
conceyued ouer yonge/ as before .xij. yee or .xv. 
yere of aege/ which cha~seth somtyme/ though 
not verye often/ and that the passage be ouer 
angust streate or narowe/ other naturally/ or 
els for some disease and infirmite/ which may 
happen about that parte/ as apostumes/ pusshes/ 
pyles/ or blysterres/ and such other/ thorowe 
the whiche causes nature can not (but 
with great dolor and payne) open and dilate 
[^f.14v^] 
it selfe to the expellynge & delyuerance of the 
chylde. And sometyme the vesyke or bladder/ 
or other intralles beyng about the matrice or 
wombe be also apostumat & blystered/ whiche 
beynge greaued/ the matrice or wombe lykewyse 
is greaued with them/ and that hyndereth 
greatly the deliueraunce. Also sometyme 
in the fundament are emerrodes or pyles and 
other pusshes/ chappynges or chynnes which 
cause greate payne/ also hardnes and difficulte 
or byndynge of the belly/ which thinges for 
the grefe and payne that ensueth of them causeth 
the woman to haue lyttell power to help 
herselfe in her labor. 
 
Farthermore if the partie be weke and of 
feble complexion/ or of nature very colde/ or to 
yonge/ or very aged/ or to grosse and fatte/ or 
contrarye wyse to spare and leane/ or that she 
neuer had chylde before/ or that she be ouer timorous 
and fearefull/ dyuers waywarde/ or 
suche one as wyll not be ruled/ remouyng her 
selfe from one place to another/ all such thynges 
causeth the labour to be much more paynfull/ 
cruell/ and dolorous/ then it wolde otherwyse 
be. Also ye must vnderstande that generallye 
the byrthe of the man is easyer then the 
[^f.15r^] 
byrth of the female. 
 
Item yf the chylde be of a fuller & greater 
groweth than that it maye easelye passe that 
narowe passage/ or contrarye wyse/ yf it be so 
faynt/ weake/ and tender/ that it can not turne 
it selfe/ or doth it very slowly/ or yf the woma~ 
haue two chyldren at ones/ other elles that it 
with the which she laboreth be a monster/ as 
for example/ yf it haue but one body and two 
heddes/ as appeareth in the .xvij. of the byrth 
fygures/ such as of late was sene in the dominion 
of werdenberghe. 
 
Agayne whe~ it procedeth not in due tyme 
or after due fashion/ as when it cometh forthe 
with bothe fete or both knees togyther/ or els 
with one fote onely/ or with both fete downewarde 
and both handes vpwarde/ other els 
(the which is most perellous) sydelong/ arselonge/ 
or backelonge/ other hauynge two at a 
byrth/ both procede with their fete fyrst/ or one 
with his fete and the other with his head/ by 
those and diuers other wayes the woman susteyneth 
greate doloure payne and anguysh. 
 
Item yf the woman suffer aborsme~t/ that 
is to saye brynge forth her chylde in the .iiii. or 
v. moneth after the conception/ whiche is before 
[^f.15v^] 
the due tyme/ in this case it shalbe great 
payne to her/ for so muche as (accordynge to 
Galenus sayenge) in that tyme the entrance 
of the wombe is so firmely and strongely enclosed/ 
that scace the poynte of a nedle maye 
enter in at it. 
 
Also yf the chyld be dead in the mothers 
bellye it is a verye perellous thynge/ forsomuche 
as it can not be easely turned/ nother 
can it weld or helpe it self to come forth/ or yf 
the chyld be sycke or weakened/ so that it can 
not for feablenesse helpe it selfe. The whiche 
thynge maye be foresene & knowen by these 
tokens: Yf the woman with chylde haue ben 
longe sycke before her labor/ yf she haue ben 
sore laxed/ yf after her conception she haue 
had dayly & vnwontly her flowres/ yf streate 
after one moneth vppon the conception her 
brestes yelde anye mylke/ yf the chylde steare 
not ne moue at suche tyme as is conuenient 
for it: these be tokens that it sholde be verye 
weake. By what tokens ye shall knowe it is 
dead/ I shall shewe you in the nynth chapter 
hereafter. 
 
Also there is greate parell in laborynge/ 
when the secondyne or latter byrthe is ouer 
[^f.16r^] 
fyrme or stronge/ and wyll not sone ryue or 
breake asunder/ so that the chylde maye haue 
his easy commyng forth. And contrary wyse 
when it is ouer weake slender or thynne/ so 
that it breaketh asunder before that the chyld 
be turned or apte to yssue forthe/ for then the 
humours which are collecte and gathered to 
gether about this secondyne or seconde byrth 
passe away soner then it sholde do/ & the byrth 
shall lacke his due humidite and moystenes/ 
whiche sholde cause it the easelyar to procede 
and with lesse payne. 
 
The byrth also is hindered by ouer much 
colde or ouer muche heete/ for in ouer muche 
colde the passage and all other powres of the 
laborynge woman be coarted and made narrower 
then they wolde otherwyse be. Lykewyse 
ouer much heate debiliteth/ weakeneth 
and faynteth both the woman and the chyld/ 
so that neyther of them in that case can well 
welde or helpe them selfes for fayntnesse. 
 
And forther yf the woman haue vsed to 
eate commenly such meate or fruytes/ whiche 
do exiccat or drye and constrayne or bynde/ as 
medlars/ chestenuttes/ all sowre fruyte/ as 
crabbes/ chokeperes/ and suche other/ with 
[^f.16v^] 
ouer muche vse of vergens/ & such lyke sowre 
sauces/ with ryse myll/ and many other thynges/ 
all this shall greately hynder the byrth. 
 
Also the vse of colde bathes after the .v. 
moneth folowyng the conception or to bathe 
in such water where alome is/ yron/ or salte/ or 
any suche thynges which do coarcte and constrayne/ 
or yf she haue ben oftentymes heauye 
and murnyng/ or yll at ease/ or yf she haue ben 
kept ouer hungrye and thurstye/ or haue vsed 
ouer much watche and walkinge/ other yf she 
vsed a lyttell before her labor thinges of great 
odour smell or sauoure/ for suche thynges attracte 
and drawe vpwarde the mother or matrice/ 
the whiche is greate hynderaunce to the 
byrthe. 
 
Also yf the woma~ fele payne onely in the 
backe and aboue the nauell and not vnder/ it 
is sygne of harde labor/ lykewyse yf she ware 
wont to be delyuered with greate payne in tymes 
passed/ is a sygne of great labor alwayes 
in the byrth. 
 
Nowe sygnes and tokens of an expedite 
and easy delyueraunce be such as be contrary 
to all those that go before. As for example/ 
when the woman hathe ben wonte in tymes 
[^f.17r^] 
passed easelye to be [^ORIG. BLURRED^] that in her 
labor she feale but lyttell thronge or dolor/ or 
thoughe she haue greate paynes/ yet they remayne 
not alwayes in the vppar partes/ but 
descend to the nether partes or botome of the 
bellye. 
 
And to be shorte in all paynefull & troublesome 
labours/ these sygnes betoke~ & signify 
good spede and lucke in the labor: vnquietnes/ 
muche stearynge of the chylde in the mothers 
belly/ all the thronges and paynes tomblynge 
in the fore parte of the botome of the 
bellye/ and when the woman is stronge and 
myghtye of nature/ and such as can well and 
strongelye helpe her selfe to the expellynge of 
the byrth. And agayne euell sygnes be those/ 
when she swetethe colde swete: and that her 
pulces beate and labor ouer sore/ and that she 
her selfe in the laborynge faynt and swowne: 
these be vnluckye and mortall sygnes. 
 
[}Howe a woman with chylde shall _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]se 
herselfe, and what remedies be fo_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
them that haue harde labor. 
 
Cap. iiii.}] 
 
[^f.17v^] 
T_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] [^ORIG. BLURRED^] such as are 
in suche difficull parell of labor/ 
as we haue spoken of before/ ye 
must obserue/ kepe & marke those 
thynges whiche we shall (by the 
grace of god) shew you in this chapter folowynge. 
Fyrst the woman with chyld must kepe 
two dyettes/ the one a monethe before her labor/ 
the other in the verye laborynge/ & aboue 
all thynges she muste exchue and forbare all 
suche thynges which maye hynder the byrthe 
so nere as she can possible/ the which we rehersed 
in the chapter before/ but yf there be anye 
suche thynge which can not be auoyded/ for so 
much as it commeth by nature or by long contynuance 
and custome: in this case yet ye shall 
vse some such remedies/ the which maye somwhat 
asswage it/ mollifye it/ or make it more 
easye or tollerable/ so that it hynder the byrth 
so muche the lesse. 
 
But yf it so be/ that any infirmitie or dysease/ 
swellyng/ or other apostumation chanse 
about the mother or the preuy parte/ or about 
the vesyke or bladder/ as the stone/ the strangurye/ 
and suche lyke: the whiche thynges 
may cause suche straytenesse and coarctation 
[^f.18r^] 
that vnnethe greate and horrible payne/ the 
partie can be delyuered or discharged: in these 
cases it behouethe suche thynges to be loked 
vnto and cured before the tyme of labor commethe/ 
by the aduyse of some experte Surgion. 
 
Also yf the woman be ouer muche constipat/ 
or bounde all wayes/ she muste vse the 
monethe before her labour suche thynges/ the 
whiche maye lenifye/ mollifye/ dissolue/ and 
loose the bellye: as aples fryed with sugre taken 
fastynge in the mornynge/ and after that 
a draughte of pure wyne alone/ or elles tempered 
with the iuyce of swete and rype apples. 
Also to eate fygges in the mornynge 
fastynge and at nyghte/ loosethe welle the 
bellye. 
 
Agayne in this case she muste refrayne 
frome all suche thynges as doo harden/ restrayne/ 
and constipat: as be suche thynges/ 
the whyche be browled or rosted/ & ryse/ harde 
egges and myll/ and suche lyke. 
 
Also yf farther necessite require she maye 
receaue a clyster/ but it muste be very gentell 
and easye tempered other with cheken brothe 
or brothe of other flesshe: she maye vse also 
[^f.18v^] 
some other easye and temperat purgation to 
mollifye and loose her with all: also a suppositar 
tempered with sope/ larde/ or the yolke 
of egges. 
 
And yf it chaunse that (the labor drawynge 
nere) she waxe faynte or syckelye: then 
muste ye comforte her with good comfortable 
meate/ drynke/ holsome and noble electuaries/ 
and in this tyme must she do all such thinges 
the whiche can make her apte and sufficiente 
to her labor/ & to vse suche thynges the which 
maye laxe/open/ and mollifye the nature and 
passage/ so that the byrth maye the more frely 
procede: and that chieflye in the younger women. 
The elder women for because that/ that 
partes in them be somewhat dryer & harder/ 
therfore they muste vse hote and moyst thynges 
which haue properte to lenifye and sople/ 
and that bothe in meate and drynke/ and also 
in outwarde fomentations/ bathynges/ suppositaries 
and anoyntme~tes: Anoyntmentes 
wherewith ye maye sople the priuie place/ be 
these: hennes grese/ duckes grese/ goose grese/ 
also oyle olyfe/ or lynesede oyle/ or oyle of fenegreke/ 
or the viscosite of holyoke & such other/ 
and for drinke let her vse good rype wyne mixed 
[^f.19r^] 
with water: also ther must be a consideration 
in the dietynge of the woman/ that she 
maye vse such thynges the which maye moysten 
her/ and not make her fatte. Contraryewyse 
let her auoyde such thynges the whiche 
sholde exiccat drye constrayne or coarte her: & 
that all the monethe before her labor. But about 
.x. dayes before the tyme (yf she fele any 
payne or grefe) let her vse euery day to washe 
or bathe her with warme water/ in the which 
also that she tary not ouer longe in bathynge 
for weakening of her: in the bath let her stand 
so that the water come aboue the nauell a lyttell/ 
and lette be sodde in the water mallows/ 
holyoke/ camomell/ mercurye/ maydenhere/ 
lynesede/ fenegreke sede/ and such other thynges 
which haue vertue to mollifye and suple: 
and yf it so be that for weakenesse of the body 
she maye not endure this bathynge in warme 
water/ then with a sponge or other cloth dypped 
in the foresayde bathe/ let her sokynglye 
washe her fete/ her thyghs/ and her pryuy partes/ 
the whiche thynge shall greatly profet to 
her. But in suche tyme beware ye come not in 
the co~mune hote houses/ for they wolde cause 
you to be feble and faynte/ whiche ware yll in 
[^f.19v^] 
this case. 
 
And when ye are thus bathed or washed/ 
then shall it be very conuenient for you to annoynte 
with the foresayde greses and oyles 
youre backe/ belly/ nauell/ sydes/ and such places 
as are nere to the preuye partes. Farthermore 
it shall be greatelye profitable for her to 
conueye inwarde in to the preuye parte these 
foresayde oyles or greses with a sponge or other 
thynge made for the purpose/ she lyenge 
vpryght the middes of her body most hyest/ so 
that it maye the better remayne within her/ 
and that chieflye/ yf the matrice be drye/ other 
elles the partie very leane and spare. 
 
It shalbe also verye profytable for her to 
suffume the nether places with muske/ ambre/ 
gallia muscata/ whiche putte on embers 
yelde a goodlye sauour/ by the whiche the nether 
places ope~ the~ selfe & draw downwarde. 
 
Also as I sayd before/ she must take good 
hede to her dyette/ that she take thynges the 
whiche maye comforte and strenghten the bodye/ 
feadynge not ouer muche of any thynge/ 
and to drynke pleasaunt and well sauerynge 
wyne/ or other drynke/ also moderatly to exersyce 
the body in doyng some thing/ stearynge/ 
[^f.20r^] 
mouinge/ goyng/ or standyng/ more then other 
wise she was wo~t to do: these thinges farther 
the byrth & make it the easyer: & this is the maner 
of dyette the which we aduise the woman 
to kepe the moneth before her labor or longer. 
 
Another dyette there is/ the whiche she 
ought to obserue in the tyme of labor/ when 
the stormes and thronges begyn to come on/ 
and the humours/ whiche yet hytherto haue 
remayned about the matrice or mother collected/ 
nowe begyn to flowe forth: and this maner 
of dyette consysteth in two sortes. Fyrste 
that suche thynges be procured and had in redynesse 
whiche maye cause the byrth or labor 
to be very easye. Secondly to withstande/ defende 
& to put awaye so nere as may be the insta~t 
& present dolours. And as touchinge this 
poynt/ it shalbe very profitable for her for the 
space of an houre to syt styll/ the~ rysyng again 
to go vp & downe a payre of stayres cryeng or 
reaching so loude as she ca~/ so to stere herselfe. 
 
Also it shalbe very good for a tyme to retayne 
and kepe in her brethe/ for because that 
thorow that meanes the guttes and intralles 
be thrust and depressed downeward. 
Also it shalbe verye good to receyue the same 
[^p.20v^] 
medicine/ the which we shall describe hereafter/ 
for that medicine expellethe and sendeth 
forthe the byrth. 
 
But when the woma~ perceaueth the matrice 
or mother to waxe laxe or loose/ and to be 
dyssolued/ and that the humours yssue forthe 
in great plente/ then shall it be mete for her to 
syt downe lenynge backewarde in maner vpryght. 
For the which purpose in some regio~s 
(as in France and Germanye) the mydwyfes 
haue stooles for the purpose/ whiche beynge 
but lowe and not hye frome the grounde/ is 
made soo compase wyse and caue or holowe 
in the myddes/ that that maye be receaued 
from vndernethe whiche is loked for: and the 
backe of the stoole lenyng backewarde/ receauethe 
the backe of the woman/ the fashion of 
the which stole is set in the begynninge of the 
byrth fygures hereafter. 
 
And when the tyme of labor is come/ in 
the same stole ought to be put manye clothes 
or clowtes in the backe of it/ the whiche the 
midwife may remoue fro~ one syde to another 
accordyng as necessite shal require. The mydwyfe 
herselfe shall syt before the laboryng woman/ 
and shall diligently obserue and wayte 
[^f.21r^] 
howe muche & after what maner the chylde 
stearethe it selfe: also shall with her handes 
fyrste annoynted with the oyle of almondes 
or the oyle of whyte lylies rule & directe euery 
thynge/ as shall seme best. Also the mydwyfe 
muste enstructe and comfort the partie 
not onely refresshynge her with good meate 
and drynke/ but also with swete wordes/ geuynge 
her good hope of a spedefull delyueraunce/ 
encouragyng and enstomacking her 
to pacience and tolleraunce/ byddyng her to 
holde in her brethe in so muche as she maye/ 
also strekynge gentylly with her handes her 
belly aboue the nauel/ for that helpeth to depresse 
the byrth downewarde. 
 
But and yf the woman be any thynge 
grosse/ fat/ or flesshly it shall be best for her to 
lye grouelyng/ for by that menes the matrice 
is thrust and depressed downewarde/ anoyntynge 
also the preuy partes with the oyle of 
whyte lyllies. And yf necessite require it/ let 
not the mydwyfe be afrayde ne asshamed to 
handle the places and to relaxe and lose the 
straytes/ for so muche as shall lye in her/ 
for that shall helpe wel to the more expedite 
and quycke labor. 
 
[^f.21v^] 
But this must the mydwyfe aboue all 
thynges take hede of that she co~pell not the 
woman to labor/ before the byrth come forewarde/ 
& shewe it selfe. For before that tyme 
all labor is in vayne/ labor as muche as ye 
lyst. And in this case many tymes it cometh 
to passe/ that the partie hath labored so sore 
before the tyme/ that when she sholde labor 
in dede/ her myght and strength is spent before 
in vaine/ so that she is not nowe able to 
helpe her selfe/ and that is a peryllous case. 
 
Farthermore when the secondine or seconde 
byrthe (in the which the byrth is wrapped 
and conteyned) doth ones appeare/ then 
maye ye knowe that the labor is at hande/ 
wherfore yf the same secondine breake not 
of his owne kynde/ it shalbe the mydwyfes 
parte and offyce with her nayles easely and 
gentely to breake it/ and rent it/ or yf it maye 
not so conuenientlye be done/ then reyse vp 
betwene your fyngers a pece of it/ and cutte 
it of with a payre of sheeres/ or a sharpe 
knyfe/ but soo that ye hurte not the byrthe 
with the cutte/ this done/ by and by ensueth 
conseque~tly the flux and flowe of humours/ 
of the whyche I spake before/ and then 
[^f.22r^] 
nexte foloweth immediatly the byrthe. 
 
But yf it so chanse the secondine sholde 
be cutte by the mydwyfe and all the watery 
parte yshued and spent before due tyme and 
necessite sholde requyre it/ so that the preuye 
passage be lest exiccat and drye/ the byrth not 
yet appearynge/ and by this meanes the labor 
sholde be hyndered and letted. In this 
case ye shall annoynt and mollify that preuy 
passage with the oyle of white lillies/ or som 
of the greses spoken of before/ fyrste wharmed 
and so conueyed in to the preuy partes 
the whiche thynges wyll cause the waye to 
be slypperye/ sople/ and easye for the byrth to 
passe. But chiefly in this difficulties sholde 
profette the whyte of an egge together with 
the yolke powred in to that same place/ whiche 
sholde cause it to be moste slypperye and 
slydynge. 
 
And yf it so be/ that the byrthe be of a 
greate groweth/ and the head stycke in the 
commynge forthe/ then muste the mydwyfe 
helpe al that she may/ with her handes fyrst 
annoynted with some oyle openyng and enlargynge 
the waye/ that the yssue maye be 
be the frear: lykewyse muste be done yf she 
[^f.22v^] 
bare two chyldren at once. And all this is 
spoken of the naturall byrth when that fyrst 
procedeth the head/ and then the reste of the 
body ordinatly/ as ye maye se in the fyrste of 
the byrth fygures folowynge. 
 
ij. But when the byrthe commeth contrarye 
to nature/ then must the mydwyfe do 
all her diligence and payne/ yf it may be possible/ 
to turne the byrthe tenderlye with her 
annoynted handes/ so that it maye be reduced 
agayne to a naturall byrthe/ as for 
example: Some tyme it chanseth the chylde 
to come the legges and both armes and handes 
downewarde cloose to the sydes fyrste 
forthe/ as appearethe in the seconde of the 
byrth figures/ in this case the mydwife must 
do all her payne with tender handelyng and 
annoyntyng to receaue forthe the chylde/ the 
legges beynge styll close to gether/ & the handes 
lykewyse remaynynge/ as appeareth in 
the say_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e.ij. figure. Howe be it/ it were farre 
better (yf it maye be by any meanes) that the 
mydwy_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] sholde turne these legges co~myng 
fyrste forthe vpwardes agayne by the bellywarde/ 
soo that the heade myghte descende 
downward by the backe part of the wombe 
[^f.23r^] 
for then naturally agayne & without parell 
as the fyrste myght it procede & come forthe. 
 
iij. Agayne sometyme the byrthe commeth 
forth with both legges and fete fyrste/ 
the handes beinge lyfted vp aboue the head 
of the chylde/ and this is the parelloust maner 
of byrth/ that is as appeareth in the .iij. 
of the byrth figures. And here must the mydwyfe 
do what she maye to turne the byrth yf 
it maye be possible to the fyrst figure/ and yf 
it wyll not be/ muste reduce _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]he handes of it 
downe to the sides/ & so to reduce it into the 
ij. figure. But yf this also wyll not be: then 
receaue the feate as they come forth/ & binde 
them with some fayre lynnen clothe/ and so 
tenderly and very softly loose out the byrth 
tyll all be come forth/ and this is a very ieopardous 
labor. 
 
iiij. Also sometyme the byrth commeth 
forwarde with one fote onely/ the other beynge 
left vpwarde/ as appeareth in the .iiij. 
fygure. And in this case it behoueth the laborynge 
woman to laye her vpryght vppon 
her backe/ holdynge vp her thyghes & belly/ 
so that her heade be the lower part of her body: 
then let the mydwyfe with her hande returne 
[^f.23v^] 
in agayne the fote that commeth oute 
fyrste in as tender manner as maye be/ and 
warne the woma~ that laboreth to stere and 
moue her selfe/ so that by the mouynge and 
sterynge the byrth maye be turned the head 
downewarde/ and so to make a naturall 
byrth of it/ and then to set the woman in the 
stole agayne/ and to do as ye dyd in the fyrste 
fygure/ but yf it so be that notwithstandyng 
the mothers stearynge and mouynge the 
byrth do not torne/ then muste the mydwyfe 
with her hande softelye fetche out the other 
legge whiche remayned behynde/ euermore 
takynge hede of this that by handelynge of 
the chylde she do not remoue ne sette oute of 
theyr place the two ha~des hangyng downewarde 
towarde the fete. 
 
v. Lykewise somtyme it co~meth to passe 
that the syde of the chyld co~meth forwarde/ 
as appeareth in the .v. fygure/ & then must 
the mydwyfe do so/ that it maye be returned 
to his naturall fasshion/ & so to come forthe. 
 
vi. Also sometyme the chylde commeth 
forthe the fete forwarde/ the legges beynge 
abroade/ as in the .vi. figure/ and the muste 
the mydwyfe se/ that the fete & legges maye 
[^f.24r^] 
be ioyned to gether/ and so to procede & come 
forth/ euermore regarding the handes/ as I 
warned you before. 
 
vij. Yf it come with one of the knees or 
bothe forewarde/ as in the .vij. figure/ then 
muste the mydwyfe putte vp the byrth/ tyll 
such tyme as the legges and fete come ryght 
forth/ and then to do as afore. 
 
viij. When the chylde commeth hedlonge/ 
one of the handes commyng out and 
appearyng before/ as in the .viij. figure/ then 
let the byrthe procede no farther/ but let the 
mydwyfe put in her hande and tenderlye by 
the shoulders thrust in the byrth agayne/ so 
that the hande maye be setteled in his place 
agayne & the byrth to come forth ordinatly & 
naturally/ as in the first figure/ but if by this 
meanes the hand come not to his conuenie~t 
place/ then let the woman lye vpryght with 
her thyghes & bellye vpwardes/ & her head 
downewardes/ so that by that meanes it 
maye be brought to passe/ and then to bryng 
her to her feate agayne. 
 
ix. But yf it procede with both handes 
forewardes/ then muste ye lykewyse do as afore: 
by the shulders thrustynge it backe agayne/ 
[^f.24v^] 
vntyll suche tyme as the handes lye 
close to the sydes/ and so to come forth as appeareth 
in the .ix. fygure. 
 
x. But when it commeth arsewarde/ 
as in the .x. fygure maye be sene/ then muste 
the mydwyfe with her handes retorne it agayne/ 
vntyl such tyme that the byrth be turned/ 
the legges and fete forwarde/ other els 
yf it maye so be/ it ware beste that the heade 
myght come forwarde/ and so naturallye to 
procede. 
 
xi. And yf it so be that it appere & come 
forth fyrst with the sholders/ as in the .xi. figure/ 
then must ye fayre and softely thrust it 
backe agayne by the sholders/ tyll such tyme 
as the heade come forewarde. 
 
xii. But when the byrth co~meth forthe 
with both handes and bothe fete at once/ as 
in the .xij. fygure/ then muste the mydwyfe 
tenderly take the chylde by the head/ and returne 
the legges vpwarde/ and so to receyue 
it forth. 
 
xiij. And when it cometh brestewarde/ 
as in the .xiij. figure/ the legges and handes 
bydynge behynd/ then let the mydwyfe take 
it by the fete or by the head/ which that shall 
[^f.25r.^] 
be moste apte and commodious to come forwarde/ 
returnynge the rest vpwarde/ and so 
to receaue it forth/ but if it maye be hedlong/ 
it shalbe best. 
 
xiiij. Nowe sometyme it chaunseth the 
woman to haue two at a burden/ and that 
bothe procede to gether headlonge/ as in the 
xiiij. figure/ & then must the midwyfe receaue 
the one after the other/ but so that she let not 
slyppe the one whylest she taketh the fyrste. 
 
xv. Yf bothe come forthe at once with 
theyr fete foreward/ then must the mydwyfe 
be very diligent to receaue fyrst the one/ and 
then the other/ as hath ben shewed before. 
 
xvi. When the one co~meth hedlonge/ 
the other fotewyse/ then must the mydwyfe 
helpe the byrth that is most nerest the yssue/ 
& it that co~meth fotelo~g (if she ca~) to returne 
it vpon the head/ as is spoken of before/ taking 
euer the hede/ that the one be not noyso~ 
to the other i~ receauing forth of ether of the~. 
 
And to be shorte/ let the mydwyfe often 
tymes annoynte and mollifye the waye and 
passage with some of the foresayd oyntmentes/ 
to make the womans labor so much the 
easyar/ & haue the lesse thronge trauell and 
[^f.25v^] 
payne/ & yf there chanse to be any apostume/ 
or dysease about that places in this tyme by 
suche annoyntynge to alaye and swage the 
payne: so that for the tyme it may be the lesse 
grefe to the partie/ as I spoke of before also/ 
and for them that be in this case/ it shall be 
best to lye growelyng/ as I said of the grosse 
fatte and flesshly woman. 
 
[}Remedies and Medicines by the whiche the 
labor maye be made more tollerable, easy, 
and without greate payne. 
Cap. v.}] 
 
ALl suche thynges as helpe the 
byrth & make it more easye/ are 
those: Fyrst the woma~ that laboreth 
must other syt grouling 
or els vpryght leanynge backewarde/ 
accordynge as it shall seme commodious 
and necessarye to the partie/ or as she 
is accustomed. And in wynter or colde whether 
the chamber wherin she laboreth muste 
be warmed/ but in somer or hote whether/ 
let in the ayre to refresshe her withall/ lest betwene 
extreme heate and labor the woman 
faynt and sounde/ and farthermore she must 
[^f.26r^] 
be prouoked to sneesynge/ & that other with 
the powder of Eleborus/ or elles of pepper. 
Also the sydes of the woman must be streke~ 
downewarde with the handes/ which thing 
helpeth greately and farthereth/ and let the 
mydwyfe alway be very diligent prouidyng 
and seinge what shalbe necessary for the woman/ 
annoyntinge the priuities with oyle or 
other such grese as I spoke of before in this 
fasshion: Take the oyle of whyte lyllies or 
duckes grese/ & with that temper two graynes 
wayghte of Safran and one grayne of 
muske/ and with that oyntmente annoynte 
the secrete partes . Yf this profet nothynge/ 
then vse this suffumigation. 
 
Take myrrhe/ galbanum/ castorium/ let 
those be beten and make lyke pylles of them 
tempered to gether with bulles gaule/ then 
take a dramme of this pylles/ and put it on 
hote coles/ and let the woman receaue the 
fume and sauoure of it vndernethe. 
 
Another perfume: Take yelowe brymstone/ 
myrrhe/ mader/ galbanum/ oppoponacum/ 
of eche lyke much/ and temper all these 
together/ makynge of them pylles/ and with 
those also ye may make fume to be receaued 
[^p.26v^] 
vnderneth. Ite~ the fume of culuer dunge or 
of hawkes dunge by puttyng to of oppoponacum/ 
is souerayne for the same. All these 
fumes open the poores benethe/ and causeth 
nature to be the frear in delyueraunce. 
 
Also it is very good to dyp wooll in the 
iuyce of rue/ and the same to conuey into the 
secreates. Also the pouder of aristolochia rotu~da/ 
or the rote called bothor martis/ or malum 
terre/ or the sede of staphisagre: any of 
these wrapped in wooll and conueyed inwarde 
prouoketh & calleth forthe the byrth. 
 
Item take heleborus/ oppoponacu~/ and 
wrap them to gether in wooll/ and ministre 
them inwarde: for that wyll brynge forthe & 
prouoke the byrthe/ whether it be alyue or 
dead. Also the rynde and barke of cassia fistula 
beaten to pouder/ and tempered with 
wyne and dronke~/ prouoketh well the byrth. 
 
Item asa fetida of the bygnes & waight 
of a pese myngled to gether with castorium 
of the wayght of a dram~: beaten to gether & 
tempered with wyne myxt with water and 
so dronke~/ is very good to prouoke the byrth 
Also canell dronke with wine is very good. 
 
Item take a scruple of roses/ with the 
[^f.27r^] 
water of the sede of fenegreke/ cicercula/ maydenhere/ 
all beaten to gether and soden/ and 
the oyle of blewe flowre de luce a smal quantite 
tempered there with all: and then geue 
it to the woman that laboreth/ and it shall 
prouoke the byrthe greately. Also cassia lignea 
and asa ferida dronke with wyne/ be very 
good for the same. Also holyoke soden in 
water and dronke~/ is souerayn for the same 
purpose/ & it is verye good for her to washe 
her in the water/ in the whiche this holyoke 
is decocte and soden in. 
 
[}Certayne pylles the whiche make the 
labor easye and withoute 
payne.}] 
 
TAke canell or cinamome and of 
sauyne of eche a dram~/ of cassia 
lignea a dram~ and a halfe/ of 
myrrhe/ aristolochia rotunda/ & 
costemary of eche a dram~/ of storax 
liquida halfe a dram~/ and of oppium the 
wayght of .xij. graynes/ bete these all to gether/ 
and forme them into pylles/ and geue 
vnto the woman two dram~s of these pylles 
with .ij. ounces of good olde wyne. 
[^f.27v^] 
Item Safrane and Syler Montanum 
prouoketh the byrth of any lyuynge thynge/ 
yf it be droncke~: howe be it to a woman geue 
neuer passynge a drame at once of Safrane/ 
for greater quantite sholde greately hurte. 
 
Item take .v. drames of Sauyne/ of rue 
or herbe grace one dragm~ & an halfe/ of iuniper 
byryes .ij. dram~s/ of asa fetida/ amoniacum/ 
madder/ of ech .ij. dram~s: of these make 
pylles/ geuen to the woma~ in labor with water 
in the whiche is soden sauyne and penyryall/ 
or els with the brothe of cicercula/ and 
the iuyce of rue shall helpe very greately. 
 
Item take .ij. dram~s of sauyne/ of asa fetida/ 
armoniacum/ & madder/ of eche halfe 
a dram~/ these temper to gether in pilles/ and 
geue her with wyne .ij. dram~s of the same. 
 
Item take of aristolochia longa/ pepper 
and myrrhe/ of eche lyke much/ confict them 
to gether with wyne & make pylles of them/ 
& minister them with an ounce of water of 
the decoction of lupynes/ these pylles be of 
such efficacy and strength that it alleuiateth 
and vnpayneth the byrthe/ it delyuereth the 
matrice or mother from all maner of byrth/ 
be it alyue or dead. 
[^f.28r^] 
Item take of whyte bedellium/ myrrhe/ 
and sauyne/ of eche lyke much: temper these 
with cassia lignea and hony/ and make pylles 
of them of the byggenesse of pesen/ & of 
these pylles geue at eche tyme .v. to the laborer/ 
whiche be of the same myght & strength 
with the other pylles spoken of here nexte 
before. 
 
Item take of myrrhe/ castorium/ and storax/ 
of eche one dram~/ temper them with hony/ 
and make pylles of it/ these for this purpose 
excell and passe al other/ they be of such 
vertue and strength in operation. 
 
A plaster to prouoke the byrthe: Take 
wyld goward/ & seth it in water/ in the same 
water temper myrrhe/ the iuyce of rue/ and 
barlye meale/ so muche as shalbe sufficient/ 
stampe these thynges to gether/ and make 
it plasterwyse/ then laye it to the womans 
belly betwene the nauel and the nether part 
this plaster shall helpe meruelouslye. 
 
And although many other thinges ther 
be the which haue vertue and power to prouoke 
byrth and to help it/ yet leuyng all such 
thynges for breuite and shortenesse we haue 
set here suche thynges/ which are chiefe and 
[^f.28v^] 
most principally conducent for the same purpose. 
 
[}Howe the Secondyne or seconde byrth shall 
be forsed to yssue forth, yf it come not 
frelye of his owne kynde. 
Cap. vi.}] 
 
HEre also somtyme it cometh to 
passe/ that the Secondine/ whiche 
is wonte to come to gether 
with the byrth/ remayne & tary 
behynde and folowe not. And 
that for dyuers causes/ one is: For because 
peraduenture the woman hathe so sore 
weakened and feblysshed with trauell/ dolour/ 
and payne/ of that fyrst byrth/ that she 
hathe no strength remaynynge to helpe herselfe 
to the expellynge of this seconde byrth/ 
another maye be/ that it be entangled/ tyed/ 
or let within the matrice/ which cha~seth many 
tymes/ or that it be destitute of humours/ 
so that the water be flowen fro~ it soner then 
it sholde/ which shold make the places more 
slyppery and more easye to passe thorowe/ or 
els that the places ouer weryed with longe 
& sore labor/ for payne co~tract or gather together/ 
& enclose themselfe agayne/ or that the 
[^f.29r^] 
places be swollen for anguysshe and payne/ 
and so let the comminge forth of the seconde 
byrthe. 
 
But to be shorte of what so euer cause it 
be thus stopped/ the mydwyfe in anye wyse 
must fynde such meanes that it maye be vnloosed 
and expulsed. For otherwyse greate 
inconueniency sholde chaunse to the partie/ 
and specialiye suffocation & chokynge of the 
matrice/ whiche also must so much the more 
be take~ hede to/ for because the seconde byrth 
retayned & kept within/ wyll sone putrifye & 
rot: whereof wyll ensue yll noysom and pestiferous 
vapours/ ascendynge to the harte/ 
the braynes/ and the mydryffe/ throughe the 
which meanes the woma~ shalbe short wynded/ 
faynt harted/ often soundynge & lyenge 
without any maner of mouynge or stearing 
in the pulces: yee and many tymes is playnly 
suffocated/ strangled/ and dead of it: wherfore 
that none of these thinges happen/ with 
all diligens and payne it muste be prouyded 
that the secondyne be expelled. 
 
Yf retention of it come by weakenesse of 
the laborer throughe long trauell/ then must 
she be recomforted and stre~gthed with good 
[^f.29v^] 
co~fortable meates & drynkes which may enharte 
her/ as brothe made of the yolke of egges/ 
or with good olde wyne & good fat and 
tydy flesshe/ or byrdes/ hennes flesshe/ capon/ 
partrige/ pyginnes/ and suche lyke. 
And yf retentio~ of this secondine come/ 
because the place is co~tract to gether agayn/ 
other elles that the matrice is swollen for 
longe payne/ then must be vsed such thinges 
to prouoke it oute/ the whiche do make the 
way slypper/ sople/ and easy for it to procede/ 
with the oyles or oyntementes spoken of before/ 
as oyle of whyte lyllies/ of maiora~/ and 
of blewe lyllies. Item the beryes of iuniper 
or galbanum beaten to powder and dronke 
with luke warmed wyne/ wyll cause the 
same to yssue out. Ite~ sothernwood/ or elles 
penyryall soden in wyne/ and the decoction 
dronken/ is of the same vertue. 
 
Item to suffume the secreates with the 
perfumes wrytten of before/ is good for this 
purpose/ & the fume of the water/ in whiche 
mallous holyoke/ and berefutte be soden in/ 
receaued beneth/ is lyke good. Also to washe 
that partes i~ water in which is sode~ branne/ 
or to holde a lyttell bagfull of soden branne 
[^f.30r^] 
to the place/ and therewythall to sooke the 
place/ is very profytable. 
 
Byt yf the retention of the secondyne 
come by reason that it is entanglyd or fastened 
in some place of the matrice/ so that it 
wyl not resolue ne lose then make a fume vnderneth 
of brymstone/ yuie leues/ and cresses 
or elles of cresses and fygges. 
 
Also of all odoriferous and swetesmellynge 
thynges: as ambre/ muske/ frankencense/ 
gallia muscata and confection nere/ 
the whiche sauoures and perfumes put on 
the emberres must be so closely receaued vndernethe/ 
that no part of the smell do ascend 
to the nose of the woman. For to the nose 
sholde the sauour of nothynge come/ but onlye 
of suche thynges/ the whyche stynke or 
haue abhominable smell: as asa fetida/ castorium/ 
mans here or womans here burnt/ 
pecockes fethers burnt. Item in this case it 
shalbe very good to make a perfume vnderneth 
of the houe of an asse/ which thinges althoughe 
they be of yll sauoure/ yet they be of 
such nature & efficacie/ that they occasionat 
not onely the seco~dine/ but also dead byrthes 
to procede & come forth out of the matrice. 
[^f.30v^] 
And in this case also let the woma~ with 
holde her brethe inwarde in so muche as she 
can/ for that shall dryue downewarde suche 
thynges as be in the bodye to be expelled. 
Item let her be prouoked to sneese with the 
pouder of eleborus or pepper put in the nose 
holdynge her mouthe and nose soo cloose as 
maye be. 
 
Also the oyntment/ whiche is called vnguentum 
Basilicon/ conueyed into the matrice/ 
is very good/ for it mollifyeth the place 
and draweth out the secondine parforce/ the 
whiche so soone as it is expelled/ infude the 
oyle of rooses in to the same matrice. Item 
roosewater tempered with a quantite of the 
pouder of holyoke/ and dronke/ is good to expell 
the secondine. 
 
And yf it be so that any parte of the secondine 
do appeare/ let the mydwyfe receaue it 
tenderlye/ loosynge it oute fayre and softely 
leste it breake/ and yf ye doubte that it wyll 
breake/ then let the mydwyfe tye that parte 
of the whiche she hathe handfast to the womans 
legge or fote/ not very strayght/ leste it 
breake/ nether very lax/ lest it slyp in agayne/ 
and then cause her to snese. Then yf the secondine 
[^f.31r^] 
tarye or stycke/ so that it come not 
quyckly forewarde/ then loose it a lyttell & a 
lyttell very tenderlye wrething it frome one 
syde to another/ tyll such tyme as it be gotte~ 
oute/ but euer beware of violent and hastye 
mouyng of it/ lest that with the second byrth 
ye remoue the matrice also. 
 
And yf in this meane whyle the women 
faynt or sowne by reasone of great payne ensuynge 
of the takynge awaye of this secondine/ 
then muste ye minister such thinges to 
her the which comfort the head and the hart 
as be electuaries whiche are conficte with 
muske/ ambre/ and the confectio~ of precious 
stones/ as Diamargariton/ and suche other. 
Also suche thynges the whiche comforte the 
stomacke/ Diagalanga/ Dia cinamomu~/ 
and such other which are alwaye in a readinesse 
at the apothecaries/ the which thinges 
she shall receaue with wyne. 
 
Item to remoue the secondine and to expel 
it: take rue/ horehownd/ Sothernewood/ 
and motherwort/ of eche lyke quantite/ and 
then take so muche of the oyle of lyllies/ as 
maye be sufficient to stype/ moysten and soke 
the foresayd herbes in/ put all this together 
[^f.31v^] 
into a glased potte couered with suche a couer 
that it haue a lyttell hole or vent aboue 
in the toppe of it/ then set this pot ouer the 
fyre of coles/ so that it boyle a whyle/ then 
take it frome the fyre/ and sette it vnder the 
stole where the woman sytteth made for the 
nonce hauyng a pype made for that purpose 
of the whiche the one ende ye shall put into 
the vent or hole of the couer to the pot & the 
other ende must the partie receaue in to her 
bodye. And so to syt cloosed rounde aboute 
with clothes/ that no vapoure or ayre go 
forth of the potte hauing a fewe coles vnder 
it/ to kepe it hote/ and thus sytte the space of 
an houre or two/ tyll such tyme as the secondyne 
moue and begynne to procede of his 
owne kynde. And yf it be so that ye profette 
not this wayes/ yet then laye this plaster on 
the bellye betwene the nauell and the secreates/ 
of the whiche we shall speake hereafter/ 
the whiche is of suche operation and efficacite 
that it expelleth deade byrthes: yf for all 
this the secondyne come not forewarde/ then 
leaue it/ and vse no more medicines ne remedies 
to that purpose but let it alone/ for within 
fewe dayes it wyll putrifye and corrupte/ 
[^f.32r^] 
and dyssolue into a watery substance/ thycke 
lyke vryne/ or other fex myxed with water/ & 
so yssue forthe. Howbeit in the meane whyle 
it wyll put the woman to great payne in the 
heade/ in the harte/ the stomacke/ as we touched 
before. 
 
[}Howe that many thynges chaunse 
to the women after theyr labor, 
and howe to auoyde, defende, 
or to remedye the same. 
Cap. vii.}] 
 
IT is also to be vnderstanded/ 
that many tymes after the delyueraunce 
happeneth to women 
other the feuer or ague/ or 
swellyng or inflation of the bodye/ 
other tumblynge in the belly/ or els commotion 
or settelynge out of order of the mother 
or matrice. Cause of the which thynges 
is somtymes lacke of due and sufficient purgation 
and clensyng of the flowres after the 
byrthe/ or elles contrarye wyse ouer muche 
flowinge of the same/ whiche sore doth weaken 
the woman. Also the greate labor and 
stearynge of the matrice in the byrth. 
 
[^f.32v^] 
Then as ofte as it commeth for lacke of 
due purgation of the flowres/ then muste be 
ministred such thinges/ the which maye prouoke 
the same/ whether it be by medicines 
taken at the mouth/ or by lotyon & washyng 
of the fete/ or by fumes or odours or emplastration/ 
or by decoction of herbes seruynge 
to that purpose/ other els by oyntmentes/ & 
suche other thynges/ accordynge as the persone 
or the parell doth requyre/ of the which 
thynges fewe or no wemen be ignoraunt. 
And ye muste take diligent hede that she be 
exactly and vtterly purged: to this be agreable 
all suche thynges/ the whyche prouoke 
vryne & open the vaynes/ making free waye 
for the bloude to passe/ & sende the humours 
and matter downewarde/ as motherworte/ 
azure/ sauyne/ penyryall/ parcelye/ cheruyll/ 
anyse sede/ fenel sede/ iuniper byries/ rue/ baybyries/ 
germaunder/ valeriane/ tyme/ cinomome/ 
spykenarde/ & suche other. All those 
thynges as they do prouoke and cause vrine 
so do they also prouoke and cause the flowres 
to depart. Howbeit as nere as ye can vse 
none of these thynges without the counsell 
of an expert physisyon/ leste whylest ye helpe 
[^f.33r^] 
one place ye hurt another/ also to sneese helpeth 
muche in this matter/ & to holde in the 
brethe enclosynge the noose and the mouth. 
Also fumigation made of the yes of salt fysshes/ 
or of the houe of a horse vnderneth/ prouoketh 
the flowres. Yf ye profet not by this 
meanes then yf she be able to bare it/ let her 
bloude in the vayne/ called Saphena/ vnder 
the ancles of the fete/ for this p~uoketh flowres 
chieflye of all other thynges. 
 
Lykewyse doo/ yf the woman haue the 
ague after her labor/ for that co~meth of lyke 
cause by retention of the flowres/ and in the 
feuer let her vse to drynke water/ in the whiche 
is decocte barlye beaten/ or cicer and barlye 
to gether/ or water in whiche be soden 
Tamaryndi/ or waye of mylke/ and lette her 
eate cullys made of a cocke/ and swete pome 
Granates: for these thynges do prouoke the 
flowres/ & mitigateth the immoderat heate/ 
refresshynge greatelye the bodye/ loosynge 
and openynge suche thinges/ the whiche before 
ware constricte and cluddered together. 
 
Yf the body after labor do swel & inflate 
then let her drynke water in the which is soden 
cicer and cummyn beaten to gether. 
[^f.33v^] 
Item good olde wyne with the electuarium 
called diamarte/ or the whiche is called alcakengi: 
of the whiche Auicenna speaketh in 
his .v. boke. Item gumme serapine/ organnie/ 
and masticke. Also in this case a glyster 
made of suche thynges/ the which do vaynqueshe 
and expelle ventositees and wyndenesse/ 
also a pessarie or suppositar made for 
that parte of Aristolochia rotunda/ squinantum/ 
storax liquida/ doronicum/ zeduaria. 
 
Agayne yf the woman after her labor 
haue frettynge and knawyng of the guttes/ 
and payne of the matrice and other secreate 
partes there aboute/ then let her vse the vapour 
and fume of suche thynges the whiche 
haue vertue to mitigate swage and alay the 
payn/ as mallowes/ holyoke/ fenegreke/ cummyn/ 
camomell/ sauyne/ and hemlocke. 
 
Also to annoynt the places with oleum 
sesaminum/ or with oyle of swete almondes 
And yf no greate heate do abou~de in the woman/ 
she maye drynke tryacle or trifera magna 
with wyne in whiche is decoct motherwort 
or muggeworke. 
 
Also agaynste paynes in the preuy partes/ 
take penyriall/ policaria/ syx leues of bay 
[^f.34r^] 
tree: sethe them together/ and receaue the vapour 
vndernethe closely. Item take rue/ red 
motherworte/ sothernwood/ bete them to gether/ 
and temper them with the oyle of penyryall/ 
and put all together into a pot/ and set 
it ouer the fyre a whyle/ tyll it be somewhat 
soden together/ and then take it of agayne/ & 
put it all in to a lyttell rounde lynnen bagge 
made for the purpose/ the whiche with this 
herbes in it ye shall co~uaye into the secretes. 
 
Item take camomell & lyne of eche lyke 
much .iiij. handefulles: braye them together 
& sethe them with whyte wyne/ & then put it 
in a rounde bagge of lynnen/ as before was 
done/ & conuey it into the woma~s preuy partes. 
Ite~ let her drynke for the same purpose 
ij. graynes of muske with wyne. Ite~ take 
white onyons & couer the~ vnder the hote asshes 
the which whe~ they be wel rosted/ beate 
the~ to gether with freshe butter vnsalted/ & 
make it in maner of a plaster/ & then put it in 
a lynne~ bag/ & co~uey itin to the places/ as before/ 
in the meane whyle perfumyng the preuy 
partes with whyte fra~kencense & storax. 
 
Yf it be so that the woma~ be vexed about 
the backe and loynes after her labor/ take camomell/ 
[^f.34v^] 
and muggewoort/ of eche .ij. handfulles 
of woorwode/ sothernewood of eche 
one handefull/ of motherwort .iij. handefulles/ 
of cinamome and nutmegges bete~ small 
halfe an ounce/ decocte all these thynges together/ 
and in the water of this decoction 
beynge warme/ dyp a spunge or other lynnen 
clothes fomentynge/ sokynge/ and strekynge 
the backe with the same/ and so do often 
tymes/ or els put all these foresayde herbes 
together soden in a bagge/ and laye it 
plasterwyse to the backe. 
 
Yf this profette not: take oyle nardine/ 
oyle of whyte lyllies/ of ech an ounce and an 
halfe/ to the whiche put a dram~ of nutmegges 
beaten to small powder/ with this annoynte
