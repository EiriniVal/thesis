[}Galen's Art of 
PHYSICK.}] 
 
[}Prœmium. CHAP.1.}] 
 
ALL the order and Method of Physick, 
so far as concerns Order may be 
reduced to these three Heads. 
 
1. The First consists in Notion, 
which is done by Resolution. 
 
2. The Second consists in Composition 
of those things which are found 
out by this Resolution. And 
 
3. The Third of the Dissolution of Definition. 
This Third contains not only the Dissolution of 
Definition, or defining Diseases, but also an explication, 
Resolution, Division, Explanation or Exposition 
upon them, & this is the Basis of our Work at this time: 
and indeed this laies down the Way and Order to the 
whol Practice of Physick, and truly excels the other 
two as much as the Light of the Sun doth the Light of 
[^p.2^] 
the Moon, and we have drawn it into a very short Compendium, 
that so we may benefit your Judgment, and 
not burden your Memory; we have devided it into an 
hundred Chapters, whereof this is the first, each of 
the rest contain easie Rules of Definition, yea so easie 
that a Child of seven yeers old may understand them, 
and so short that they will not be burdensom to the 
weakest Memory, and although some of the Chapters 
be very short, yet they contain very necessary Rules distinct 
from the rest, and he knows nothing that knows 
not this, That Order and Method help the Memory 
much. But put all the Chapters together and they compleatly 
contain the Definition and Explanation of the 
whol Art; for from these do all Diseases arise, and in 
these doth the very Essence of Physick consist. As for 
the Contemplative part of Physick that hath been largely 
performed by us in many Treatises, which any that 
pleaseth may make use of. We come now to the matter 
it self, only we desire you to take notice, that these 
Heads are more largely discoursed of here and there in 
other of our Treatises, only we drew them up here in 
this form to satisfie the desires and inform the Judgments 
of such as intend to study Physick. 
 
[}CHAP. 2. What Medicine is.}] 
 
MEdicine is the Knowledg of things Healthful, 
not Healthful, and Neutral. 
 
This Definition is nothing else than if you should 
say, Medicine is the Knowledg of things belonging to 
the Sick, 'tis not one whit more nor less. 
 
[^p.3^] 
The Name of the Science which is Medicine is 
common, and can in no wise be taken in a proper sence, 
but things healthful, unhealthful, and neutral carry 
each of them a threefold signification, viz. As a Body, 
as a Cause, and as a Sign. For 
 
1. A Body which naturally is apt to live in health, 
and a Cause which is able to effect this, and to preserve 
it being effected, and a Sign which is able to shew and 
indicate which way this is to be done, all these the 
Grecians customarily call things healthful. 
 
2. The Body surprized and seized by a Disease, the 
Cause, which causeth and continueth this Disease, 
and the Indications or Signs which give testimony 
what this Disease is, they also term things unhealthfull. 
 
3. In things Neutral they are guided by the same 
Rules, of which we shall speak more in the Third and 
Sixt Chapters. 
 
And here we must also make a difference between 
Science and Action; or if you will, between the Theorical 
and Practical part of Medicine. For 
 
1. The Theory regards first the Cause of things 
Healthful, then of things Unhealthful; Lastly, of 
things Neutral: After this of Bodies, first Healthful, 
then Unhealthful, and in the last place Neutrals; and 
it walks by the same Rules in Signs or Indications. 
But. 
 
2. In Actions or Practice, The knowledg of the 
Body is the first thing which is minded, and this is 
found out by the Signs, and the last search (in respect 
of time) is after the Cause. 
 
[^p.4^] 
[}CHAP. 3. 
How many several waies, A Cause 
may be said to effect, a Sign to 
give Indication, and a Body to receive.}] 
 
BUt seeing that a Cause may be said to effect, a Sign 
to give Indication, and a Body receive two waies. 
 
1. Simply. 
 
2. According to time. 
 
We must know that the Art of Medicine comprehends 
them both: Simply they do it two waies, viz. 
Alwaies, and for the most part, both these the Art of 
Medicine handles. 
 
But as for things Neutral they are to be considered, 
both in respect of Body, Cause, and Sign, and in those, 
both Simply, and according to time, under a threefold 
Consideration, and the Reason is, because things 
Neutral partake of Contraries, somtimes of one, somtimes 
of the other, and somtimes of both together, and 
this last is twofold, for somtimes it participates of contraries 
equally, somtimes of one more than another. 
 
There is in all this Definition, if we dilligently heed 
the words, a certain doubtfulness or ambiguity, which 
knot ought to be unloosed, that so all things may be 
made cleer, and we may not seem instead of teaching 
people to lead them into ignorance (as the Colledg of 
Physitians doth) and that we may so do, we will devide 
the business, and speak of them all particularly. 
 
[^p.5^] 
We told you Medicine was the exact Knowledg of 
things Healthful, Unhealthful, and Neutral, and each 
of these to be considered as a Body, as a Sign, as a Cause, 
we shall now address our selves to handle, 
 
1. Such Bodies as are Healthful, Unhealthful, and 
Neutral. 
 
2. Such Signs as are Healthful, Unhealthful, and 
Neutral. 
 
3. Such Causes as are Healthful, Unhealthful, and 
Neutral. 
 
In all these we shall be both as brief, and withal as 
plain as we can. 
 
[}CHAP. 4. 
Of Healthful Bodies.}] 
 
1. A Body is Simply said to be healthful when it is 
in good natural temper, when the seven Natural 
things, viz. Spirits, Elements, Complexions, 
Humors, Members, Vertues, Operations keep a good 
decorum, then is a Body Simply said to be in Health. 
 
2. A Body in Health according to time, is taken 
not according to the Natural inclination of the Body, 
as the former was, but when it is in such a Natural 
temper, as we shewed before, only for the time being, 
the former is proper to the Body, this but accidental. 
Thus Galen. 
 
[}Culpepers Comment.}] 
 
I shall here explain a little, Galens meaning in those 
words of his; Seven Natural Things. 
 
1. Spirit, Taken in a Physical sense, is an airy substance, 
[^p.6^] 
very subtil and quick, dispersed throughout the 
Body, from the Brain, Heart, and Liver, by the 
Nerves, Arteries, and Veins, by which the powers of 
the Body are stirred up to perform their Office and Operation. 
 
2. An Element, is a Body pure, simple, unmixed, 
from which all Natural things have their Original, 
they are held to be in number four, Fire, Air, Water, 
Earth; their Operations are, Active as heat and cold, 
Passive as driness and moisture. 
 
3. Complexions are the Operations of these Elements 
upon Mans Body, as when the Fire prevails, the 
body is Chollerick, when the Air he is Sanguine, when 
the Water he is Flegmatick, when the Earth he is Melancholly. 
 
4. Humors are, 
1. Choller, whose Receptacle is the Gall. 
2. Blood, whose Seat is the Liver. 
3. Flegm, placed in the Lungs. 
4. Melancholly, which keeps his Court in the 
Spleen. 
 
Thus you see how Elements, Complexions and Humors, 
are subservient the one to other, even as the Spirit, 
Soul, and Body are (if we may reason a minore ad 
majus) in the Microcosm. 
 
5. Members or Limbs, are Simple or Compound, 
Principal or Subservient. 
 
First, Simple Members are, 
1. Bones. 
2. Cartilages. 
3. Ligaments. 
4. Veins. 
5. Arteries. 
6. Nerves. 
[^p.7^] 
7. Tendons 
8. Panides. 
9. Fat. 
10. Flesh. 
11. Skin. 
 
Secondly, Compound Members are, 
1. Head. 
2. Heart. 
3. Liver. 
4. Lungs. 
5. Legs. 
6. Arms. 
7. Hands. 
 
Thirdly, Principal Members are, 
1. Brain. 
2. Heart. 
3. Liver. 
4. Testicles. 
 
Fourthly, Members Subservient are, 
1. Nerves to carry the Animal Spirit. 
2. Arteries to carry the Vital Spirit. 
3. Veins to carry the Natural Spirit. 
4. Spermatick Vessels to carry the Procreative 
Spirit. 
 
6. Vertues, are that whereby these act the Body, and 
they are Vital, Natural, and Animal, I forbear writing 
of them, there being a Treatise of them, Astrologo 
Physically handled by me already at the latter end of my 
Ephemeris for 1651. 
 
7. Operations of these upon the Body of man are, 
First, the Animal Vertue causeth. 
1. Imagination, Apprehension, Fancy, Opinion, Consent, 
&c. in the two former Ventricles of the Brain. 
2. Judgment, Esteem, Reason, Resolution, Disposing, 
[^p.8^] 
Discerning, in the middle Ventricle of 
the Brain. 
3. Calling to mind what is to come, Remembrance 
of what is past, in the hinder Ventricle 
of the Brain. 
 
Secondly, The Vital Vertue moveth, 
1. Joy, Hope, Mirth, Singing, by dilating the 
Heart. 
2. Sadness, Sorrow, Fear, Sighing, &c. by compressing 
the Heart. 
 
Thirdly, The Natural Vertue, 
1. Altereth Food into Chyle, Chyle into Blood 
and Humors, Blood into Flesh. 
2. Joyneth, formeth, ingendreth, encreaseth, and 
nourisheth the Body of Man. 
 
And now you see what Galen intends by a Healthful 
Body, namely, such a one where all these keep a good 
and orderly decorum. 
 
[}CHAP. 5. 
Of a Body Unhealthful.}] 
 
1. A Body is simply unhealthful which is born mutilated 
by Nature, as wanting some Members, 
or some Operations or senses, that is not perfect in respect 
of those Seven Natural things before mentioned, 
as that cannot See, Hear, or Smel, or is a Fool, &c. 
 
2. According to time a Body is unhealthful that is at 
present sick in Body, or distemper'd in mind, or his Body 
broken or bruised in any part of it, whether internal 
[^p.9^] 
or external, that hath an accidental distemper in 
any of the seven Natural things. 
 
This is so cleer it needs no Comment. 
 
[}CHAP. 6. 
Of a Body Neutral.}] 
 
THis, as we told you before, carries a threefold signification. 
 
1. As things partake of either extremety swerving 
from the Rules of Healthfulness. 
 
2. As they partake of both of them together equally. 
 
3. As somtimes the one exceeds, somtimes the other in 
respect of time. 
 
1. Taken in the first Sense, it is an exquisite medium 
between healthful and unhealthful Bodies; And 
that 
 
First, Naturally or Simply, as many people are 
born of unhealthful or sickly Constitutions, so 
that the Nativity as a cause produceth such an effect 
in every age. 
 
Secondly, According to time, when the Body is 
neither perfectly in Health, nor yet sick, such a 
one as the proverb saith, Is neither sick enough to 
lie in Bed, nor well enough to follow his Imployment. 
 
2. Taken in the Second Sence, A Neutral Body is 
such a Body as partakes of diverse contrary qualities either 
in one part of the Body or in diverse; when there 
is an opposition between them, and this concerns either 
the Formation of the Body or the Endowments of the 
mind, or temperature of the parts, when one contrary 
[^p.10^] 
appears healthful, the other unhealthful, and this also 
 
1. As it appears generally in al the ages of the Life. 
 
2. As it appears but particularly at some, certain 
times. 
 
3. Taken in the third Sence, it is when the ages of 
a mans Life, Differ in respect of Health and Sickness 
as a man may be healthful in his Childhood and unhealthful 
in his youth, and the contrary, viz. sickly in 
his infancy and healthful in Youth &c. 
 
[}Culpepers Comment.}] 
 
The First of these needs no explanation, the other 
two are somthing Obscure, as in the second Galen saith 
a man may partake of contrary qualities in the formation 
of the Body, Viz. A man may have a Head too 
big and feet much too little, a man may have a Nose 
exceeding the common bigness, and Eyes as much less 
than the common proportion, and the like. 
 
2. In the Endowments of mind, as thus, A man 
may have a very good Apprehension, yet a bad Memory, 
a man may have very good Judgment in ordering 
a Battel and yet be a Coward. 
 
3. In the temperature of the parts, the Liver may be 
too hot, and yet the Brain too cold; you may understand 
the rest by these examples which are sufficient to 
explain Galens meaning. 
 
To the third, When the Ages of a mans Life differ 
in respect of health and sickness saith Galen, which is 
no more than thus, to give you one example, A 
Childs Body or any part thereof may be too hot, by 
reason of sucking a Chollerick Woman, in youth, either 
the whol Body or the same part of it may be too cold, 
imagine the Liver, Brain, or the like, it may be too hot 
in Manhood, too cold in Age or the contrary to these. 
 
Thus much for Bodies we come now to unfold the 
Signs. 
 
[^p.11^] 
[}CHAP. 7. 
Of SIGNS.}] 
 
OF these some indicate present health, others proclaim 
health to come, a third sort put us in mind 
of health past. 
 
In the same manner likewise some unhealthful Signs 
shew present Sickness, others give fair warning that 
sickness is coming, other indications call to our remembrance 
the sickness past. 
 
Imagine the like by Neutrals, some shew a present 
Neutral condition, foreshew it coming, call it to mind 
being past, and shew a disposition as well healthful as 
sickly. 
 
The use of the First and Second of these is admirable, 
the last is not so absolutely useful. 
 
And thus have we shewed you what Signs are, we 
come to treat of them particularly. 
 
[}CHAP. 8. 
Signs of a very good Constitution.}] 
 
OF these some are deduced from the Reason or Essential 
Cause thereof, or from necessary consequen 
which follow such operations, and cases, of which the 
first are called Essential the other Accidental. 
 
Such as are Essentially of good Constitution, are 
such in whose Bodies, heat, coldness, driness and moisture 
are equally tempered; the Instruments of the 
[^p.12^] 
Bodie are composed in every part of due bigness, number, 
place, and Formation. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
I shall here for the benefit of yong Students intermix 
my Comment with the Text. 
 
Whereas Galen saith, a good Constitution consists 
of heat, cold, driness, and moisture, equally tempered, 
you must not imagine they are so all over the Body, but 
according to place, for the Heart is and should be hotter 
than the Brain, &c. but each part exceeds not its 
due proportion in these, the Brain is not hotter, colder, 
drier, nor moister than it should be, judg so by the 
Heart, Liver, &c. and beleeve me such a man is a rare 
Bird to find, almost as rare as a Phænix. 
 
[}Galen.}] 
 
As for the exterior parts, in respect of softness and 
hardness they keep a mean, as also in respect of roghness 
and smoothness, and as the external parts of the Body 
recede not from beauty, so the Endowments of the 
mind differ from Vertue and Honesty as little as may 
be. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Usually you shall find it true that the handsommest 
Bodies have none of the worst conditions, nay alwaies 
if heat, cold, driness, and moisture be any thing equally 
commixed (although all the complexions are naught 
being corrupted by Adams fall, yet I say) the one if 
they be any thing equally commixed, sets a stop to the 
violent swinge of the other, but if you take Galens 
Vertue and Honesty here for Grace, that is the free 
Gift of God, and no waies coming by complexion, It 
is noted of Titus Vespasian that for Natural Endowments 
he was the Paragon of his time, and as it were 
the darling of Nature, this was the equality of his temper, 
[^p.13^] 
but he was a great persecutor of the Saints, because 
God denied him Grace, you by this may discern the 
difference between them. 
 
[}Galen.}] 
 
Temperature is apropriated especially to the Similar 
Parts, Number, Formation, Magnitude, and Scituation 
to the Instrumental Parts, unity and community to 
them both. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Similar Parts are those which before in the Fourth 
Chapter we called Simple, Instrumental are those which 
there and then we called Compound. 
 
[}Galen.}] 
 
Also the Vices or Failings in Unhealthful Bodies are 
of the same kinds, and the Bound or Limit which distinguisheth 
them is sensible hurt of the operations; 
and although Bodies of the best Constitution are now 
and then deficient, yet because it remains but a while, 
nor troubles the sences much, they are not withstanding 
to be numbred amongst healthful Bodies, we must then 
distinguish between the operations either much or little 
hurt, because Nature is able not only to hold up its 
head against, but also to vanquish the one, but it lieth 
down to the other. 
 
Unhealthful Bodies then are known by this, that 
the Operations are overcome, and lose their vigour and 
activity by any cause causing a Disease. 
 
In the middle between these two are Neutrals placed, 
and yet they have some Latitude also. 
 
The Latitude of Health is devided into three parts, 
and although the Zodiack hath but two sorts of Latitude, 
Health hath three. 
 
1. Healthful Bodies have some Latitude. 
2. Unhealthful Bodies have another. 
3. Neutral Bodies a third. 
 
[^p.14^] 
In all such as are great are easily discerned, such as are 
smal not so easily, the weaker the Operations are in the 
Hurt, the harder is the Hurt to be discerned, as an infirmity 
in feeling is not so easily discerned as one in the 
sight, because the Sence is less noble. 
 
Thus have we spoken of Healthful Bodies only in the 
general, of the other two we shall speak of severally, 
specially, and particularly, but first of all we will devide 
them into parts. 
 
[}CHAP. 9. 
How many the Differences of the 
Parts are.}] 
 
THe Universal Differences of Parts are four, because 
some are Principals, others take their Original from 
these Principals, some parts of the Body are without any 
government at all: The Principals are such as have 
their Power ingrafted in them by Nature, as the Brain, 
Heart, Liver, Testicles: others have their Original 
and Power from these, as the Nerves from the Brain, 
as also the Marrow of the Back, the Arteries from the 
Heart, the Veins from the Liver, the Seminal Vessels 
from the Testicles; some are governed by themselves 
alone, as Ligaments, Cartilages, Membranæ &c. and 
some have only Generation but no Government at all, 
as Hair and Nails. These are the Differences of Parts, 
against which at this time the Translator is not minded 
to be critical. 
 
[^p.15^] 
[}CHAP. 10. 
Of the Signs of the Brain.}] 
 
OF the Indications of the several Tempers of the 
Brain we shall speak hereafter, but there are five 
several things which shew the Nature of it. 
 
1. The Disposition of the whol Head. 
2. The Vertues and Vice of the sensible Operations. 
3. The Vertues and Vices of actual Operations, 
4. The Vertues and Vices of those things which 
hold the Principallity. 
5. The alteration of such things as are outwards. 
 
The Disposition of the whol Head is known, 
1. From the Bigness of it. 
2. From the Figure of it. 
3. From the Hair. 
 
[}CHAP. 11. 
Of the Bigness and Smalness of the 
Head.}] 
 
A Very smal Head is a proper Indication of a vicious 
Brain, and yet a great Head doth not necessarily 
declare a strong Brain; if there be not capacity 
enough in the Skull to hold the Brain, or a sufficient 
quantity of Brain, the Man must needs be a Fool, but 
[^p.16^] 
yet it no wise follows, that because the Brain is much 
therefore it should be good, that's an absolute non-sequitur. 
 
We must then distinguish it thus, 
 
1. From the forme of the Head it self. 
2. From the Parts arising from the Head. 
 
First, From the form of the Head it self the rounder 
the Head is, and the more spherical, it only being a little 
depressed on both sides (for of necessity the fore and 
hinder part must stick out a little) gives argument of a 
strong and healthful Brain. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
I suppose Galen means strong in respect of Health 
not in respect of Wit or Understanding, he that hath 
such a round Head as Galen talks of, is not so subject to 
Diseases in the Head as another man is, but we see many 
sickly men have better wits than many healthful; and 
so such as have long Heads to be as wise as such as have 
round. 
 
[}Galen.}] 
 
If the hinder part of the Head that which sticks out 
be deminished, look upon the Nerves, the Neck, and 
the Bones, for if they be according to Nature, the falt 
is in defect of Matter not of Vertue, but if they be not 
as they should be also, the very principal is debilitated, 
the Brain it self is weak and this you shall seldom find 
fail, indeed the Head neatly fashioned shews a strong 
Brain. 
 
Also the part arising or sticking out on the Forehead, 
is to be heeded, and their bigness and smalness, and 
the sences there placed, Viz. Seeing, Tasting, Smelling, 
these arising from the Principal, attest the Vertue 
or Vice of the Principal from which they arise, Viz. 
The Brain. 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
I am not altogether of Galens opinion in this, yet wil 
I not be Critical in it till I have more experience in the 
thing, the old Proverb is, and 'tis a good one, De 
mortuis nil nisi bonum, speak nothing but good of them 
that are dead. 
 
[}Chap. 12. 
Of such Operations as have obtained 
the Principality.}] 
 
THe Vertues and Vices of Principal Operations 
shew the Vertues and Vices of the Principals themselves: 
I call them Principal Operations which come 
from the Principals alone without a Medium; as subtil 
wit shews a good substance of the Brain, a dull wit 
shews the Brain to be too thick, a ready Apprehension, 
a sound Judgment, a stable and firm Memory, shews a 
good Brain, dulness of Apprehension, apish Judgment, 
and Forgetfulness shew a bad Brain; fickleness in Opinion 
shews a hot Brain, stability in Opinion, shews 
a cold Brain. 
 
And yet here are two sorts of Indications which I 
think I have passed by, though I promised them in the 
beginning; the one of which concerns Natural Operations, 
the other, things without, we shall speak of 
them hereafter. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
This Chapter, although very short, yet in my Opinion 
very pithy, I shall but ad a little to honest Galen in 
it, he tells you, That a good Judgment, a nimble Apprehension, 
[^p.18^] 
and a retentive Memory, argue a good Brain, 
they do so, yet in few men shall you find all three of 
them excellent; then consider, the Apprehension lies 
in the fore part of the Brain, and that's the reason rubbing 
the Forehead quickens the Apprehension; Judgment 
lies in the middle, and Memory in the hinder 
part of the Brain, then do but consider which of these 
three is weakest, which strongest in you, and you may 
know which part of your Brain is weakest, and which 
strongest. 
 
[}Chap. 13. 
Signs of a good temper of the 
Brain.}] 
 
IF the Brain have obtained a good temper of the four 
first Qualities, Viz. Heat, Cold, Driness, and moisture, 
the Operations thereof are alwaies moderate, 
and seldom exceed the golden mean, the excrements 
which it avoids by the mouth, Nose, Ears, or Eyes are 
moderate. It is not very subject to be hurt by external 
Heat, Coldness, Driness, or Moisture, for if the temper 
within be good, it keeps external distempers from 
harbouring there. The Hair is of a dusky red when 
Infants, of a dusky yellow when Youths, and yellow 
when Men, they curl somthing but not much, neither 
are they easily bald, and yet the colour of the Hair doth 
indeed belong not only to the temper of the Brain, but 
also to the Region Men live in, and also to the temperature 
of the Humors without the Skull. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
I like a man that is not ashamed to call in his Errors 
[^p.19^] 
as Galen here doth, and not daub over the old ones 
with a Plaister of new ones as our Colledg did in mending 
their Dispensatory, indeed Galen is in the truth, 
diverse Regions give diverse colours of Hair usually, as 
most Welch men have light or yellow Hair, most Spaniards 
black; also the temperature of Brain alters not 
the Hair at all unless by accident, as it heats or cools 
the adjacent parts, but the Humors without the Skull, 
and that's the reason in great Surfets usually the Hair 
comes off, and every one that knows any thing knows 
that the Liver is the Principal part afflicted in a Surfet. 
 
[}Chap. 14. 
Signs of a hot Brain.}] 
 
SIgns of a hot Brain besides those we named before 
are, the Forehead looks reddish and feels hot, the 
Veins on the white of the Eyes appear plain and red, 
the hair is hard and curling, they are soon bald, and the 
hotter the Brain is, the sooner are they bald, the excrements 
which come from the Brain by the Mouth, Nose, 
Ears, and Eyes, are but few, and those few argue 
drought, their Head is filled (especially such as keep no 
regular diet) with unconcocted excrements, hot Meats 
and Drinks, hot air and hot smels cause Headach, they 
sleep but little; and that little is very unquiet. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Such whose Brain is too hot are almost continually 
troubled with Headach, Dreams of fighting and quarrelling, 
their Apprehension is exceeding quick, and 
their smel good: when you find these Symtoms in one 
that is troubled with Headach, cool the Brain. 
 
[^p.20^] 
[}Chap. 15. 
Signs of a cold Brain.}] 
 
THe Indications of a Brain which is colder than it 
ought to be, are very many, excrements appear in 
their proper places which we shewed before, the hair is 
black, soft, smooth, and not curling, it is a long time 
after the Child is born before the Hair grow, they being 
evilly nourished at beginning, such are easily offended 
by cold causes, and being so offended are troubled 
with heaviness in the Head, and distillations from it, 
their Face is pale, neither is their Forehead hot, the 
Veins in their Eyes are not seen in the least, they are 
dull witted, and mightily given to sleep. 
 
[}Chap. 16. 
Signs of a dry Brain}] 
 
THe Indications of a dry Brain are very few superfluities, 
accuteness of Wit and sences, they watch much, 
their Hair is hard and rugged, yet quickly grows, it 
curls, yet are they soon bald. 
 
[^p.21^] 
[}Chap. 17. 
Indications of a moist Brain.}] 
 
THe Signs of a Brain that is moister than it should 
be are plain, Hair no waies curling, plain and 
soft, they never are Bald, their Wits are dull and stupid, 
never able to get the Phylosophers Stone, their 
Sences are not good, many excrements flow from the 
Head, they have tears at will, much and deep sleep. 
 
These are the Signs of a simple distemper of the 
Brain. 
 
[}Chap. 18. 
Signs of a hot and dry Brain.}] 
 
OF Compound Distempers we shall first give the 
Indications of a hot and dry Brain, in which 
Distemper but very few superfluities of the Brain are avoided, 
for there are but few to avoid, they have excellent 
quick and nimble Wits, they watch much, their 
Sences are good, their Hair grows soon in Youth, yet 
are they subject to be bald, their Hair curls, their 
Forehead appears red in colour, and hot in feeling. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
I am of Opinion that simple distempers seldom distemper 
the Brain, not because they are not offensive, 
but because they never go alone, and my reason is, because 
they are Compound in every Element; as the fire 
is not only hot, but also dry, the water not only cold, 
[^p.22^] 
but also moist, and that's the reason I gave you not any 
comment upon the Simple distempers; to proceed. 
 
A hot and dry distemper of the Brain usually causeth 
continual Headaches, and the more it exceeds the golden 
Mean in heat and driness, the greater is the pain, 
as for the curling of the Hair, and baldness which Galen 
speaks of, I find they do not alwaies happen true; 
for Aries which is a hot Sign gives thick Hair, and never 
baldness unless Sol be in it, if it do then, but for 
Remedies of such a distemper of the Brain, use, Fumitory, 
Willow Leaves, Lettice, Hops, Water Lillies, 
white Poppy Seeds, Roses, Violet Leaves and Flowers, 
Strawberry Leaves, the Seeds of Endive, Succory, 
Musk-Millions, and Pumpions, you may use them 
which way you please they are all harmless. 
 
Also if the pain be extream. and sleep fly from you, 
take two grains of Laudanum Londinense, at night going 
to bed. 
 
[}Chap. 19. 
Signs of a hot and moist Brain.}] 
 
IF Moisture be joyned to Heat, and both of them surpass 
the golden Mean, there follows a high colour of 
the Face, the Eyes are hot and burning, and look red, 
the Veins of the Temples seem great, the excrements 
of the Head are many, yet seem well concocted, all hot 
things whether taken inwardly or applied outwardly 
cause them to have a stretching distention and heaviness 
in their Head, if you moisten their Heads they avoid 
excrement the more, they are perpetually troubled 
with pains in their Head when the wind is South, the 
[^p.23^] 
North wind easeth them, they cannot keep themselves 
awake neither can they sleep quietly, but are molested 
with Dreams, and troubled with foolish imaginations, 
so that many times they think they see the things they 
see not, and hear the things they hear not, especially if 
the Brain offend more in heat than it doth in moisture, 
only remember the Indications of a simple distemper, 
and so may you with ease find out which quality most abounds, 
for if the heat be much, and the moisture little 
most Signs of heat appear, but if the moisture abounds 
much, and the heat be but little peccant, most 
Signs of moisture appear. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Galen could not have made a more lively Description 
of this evil if he had been in a Mans Head that had it 
with a Candle and a Lanthorn. I shall ad this, 
 
1. This Infirmity is alwaies accompanied with wind, 
which somtimes proceeds from the Hypochondria or 
Region of the Spleen, and then the Imaginations are 
dreadful, but no pain nor distention troubles the Head 
in the day time, neither are the Veins of the Temples 
swollen, this usually comes by drinking, let them take 
away the cause and the effect will cease; for it is not my 
Task to speak of the Spleen at this time. 
 
2. If the Disease be inherent to the Brain as here 
Galen describes it, bleeding is a very good Remedy, if 
the season of the yeer &c. permit; also because wind alwaies 
accompanies it, the Roots of Parsley, the Roots 
and Leaves of Fennel, Mugwort, Plantane, Vervain, and 
Willow Leaves are good Medicines, they may boyl 
them in Water and drink the Decoction. 
 
I have very often known Plantane Roots alone being 
eaten as People eat Apples, help this Infirmity when 
nothing else would, and therefore Gentlewomen might 
[^p.24^] 
do well to keep some of them candied with Sugar continually 
in their Houses, for their own benefit and their 
poor Neighbors. 
 
[}Chap. 20. 
Signs of a cold and dry Brain.}] 
 
IF a distemper of cold and driness afflict the Brain, the 
Face is cold in feeling, livid, swarthy and discoloured 
to the Eye, you can see no Veins in their Eyes, and 
their Head is easily offlicted both by cold, and cold 
things; the temper of their Brain and Head is very unequal, 
for some times their Heads are light and excrements 
flow thence moderately, somtimes they are exceedingly 
troubled with heaviness of their Heads, and they 
are troubled with Distillations from the Brain upon every 
light and slight occasion, alwaies remember the 
former rule given, regard the Signs of the Simple distempers, 
so may you know whether coldness or driness 
most super-abound. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Such whose Brains are cold and dry, have admirable 
Memories, and are fantastick in their actions, fearful, 
and think every thing they do, whether it be Meat or 
Drink, or Exercise of Body, doth them harm, they 
sleep very badly &c. 
 
A Cup of strong Beer with Nutmeg and Sugar is an 
excellent mornings draught for such People; for although 
I would have such as have their Brains too hot 
and moist fly from strong Beer and Wine as fast as from 
a Dragon, yet is it exceeding good for these. 
 
[^p.25^] 
Medicines proper for them are Conserves of Roses, 
of Borrage, and Bugloss, Confectio Alchermes. 
 
For Simples, Borrage, Bugloss, Marsh Mallows, 
Mollows, Vervain, Violet Leaves and Flowers, Strawberry 
Leaves, Betony, Sage, Fumitory, Hops, &c. 
 
[}Chap. 21. 
Signs of of a cold and moist 
Brain.}] 
 
THe Brain afflicted with cold and moist distempers, 
moves a man to an inexpugnable desire of 
sleep, and when he is awake, his Brain is so muddy, 
and his Sences so dull, that he can do nothing that 
will get him honor here, nor make him famous another 
day, the excrements that flow from his Brain are abundance, 
he seldom goes without a snotty Nose, his 
Head is full, though not of Wit, and heavy, and is most 
afflicted in cold and moist weather. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Such people are very subject to Lethargies, Coma, 
Carus, and other Diseases of the Head that proceed 
of coldness and moisture. 
 
For Cure, Juniper Berries are excellent to eat ten or 
twelve of them every morning fasting; as also Bettony, 
Chamomel, Peony Roots and Seeds, Calaminth, Fennel, 
sweet Marjoram, Penyroyal, Mother of Time &c. 
 
[^p.26^] 
[}Chap. 22. 
Of the SENCES.}] 
 
MAny have their Sences in Vigor when they are 
yong, and void of all blemish, and yet in age 
they soon decay, as you shall see the Sight of some 
People decay by that time they are twenty or twenty 
four yeers of age, and therefore 'tis true enough, that 
the Brain first declares age is coming, as usually appears 
by the Hair of the Head. 
 
[}Chap. 23. 
Of the Eyes.}] 
 
THe general mention we shall make of the Eyes is 
but short. 
 
When the Eyes being touched are manifestly hot, very 
quick and swift in motion; when men whose Eyes 
are afflicted stare nimbly about and seldom hold their 
Eyes still, when the Veins in the Eyes are large and 
red, the Eyes are afflicted by heat. 
 
If the distemper of the Eyes arise from cold the Signs 
are contrary to these. When they are offended by 
moisture they are alwaies full of moisture, and the party 
weeps against his will, but if by driness they appear 
hard and dry, in all they must be helped by a moderate 
use of things contrary to the Humor offending, I say 
moderate because of their tenderness which endures no 
violent Medicines. 
 
[^p.27^] 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
1. If the Eyes be afflicted by heat, 'tis no matter 
whether driness or moisture accompany it, as one of 
them alwaies doth, I commend unto you the distilled 
Water of Loos-strife (you may find the Description of 
it and the place where it grows, in my English Physitian) 
to wash your Eyes with. 
 
2. If it come of cold, Eyebright water is better. 
 
3. If Cataracts, Pin and Web, or the like grow over 
the Sight, do not go about to eat it off with corroding 
Medicines, as the Duncical practice of some Physitians 
is, for take notice that the Film which offendeth is not 
of a thickness in all places, and then your mother wit 
will teach you that you may eat asunder the Tunicle of 
the Eye in one place before you have eat away the Film 
offending in another: Therefore in such cases make 
an Oyntment with Chelondine (otherwise called Sullendine) 
and Hogs Grease, or an Oyl with the same 
Herb and Sallet Oyl, and anoynt your Diseased Eye 
with it. 
 
These special Rules you shall not twice in your Age 
find to fail, therfore esteem them as Jewels. 
 
[}Chap. 24. 
Of the Greatness of the Eyes.}] 
 
THe greatness of the Eyes where they are neatly composed, 
and the Sight strong, shew abundance of 
well tempered substance, whereby they are formed, but 
if neatness of composure be wanting, the substance indeed 
is much (and so there may be of a heap of dung) 
[^p.28^] 
but it is not well tempered, and therefore the Sight is 
weak and the Eye not commendable. 
 
[}Chap. 25. 
Of Smalness of the Eyes.}] 
 
SMalness of the Eyes, if they be neatly composed, and 
their Vertue operative, shews ('tis true) little substance, 
or scantiness thereof, but that substance is well 
tempered, whereof the Eyes are formed; But if together 
with smalness they have an ill composure, and withal 
fail in their Operations, their substance is but little 
and that little is stark naught. 
 
[}Chap. 26. 
Of the Colour of the Eyes.}] 
 
AS concerning what belongs to the colour of the 
Eyes, they are devided into gray and Black; Gray 
Eyes which are cleer, and abound not much with moisture, 
are an argument of a strong Sight: Judg of black 
Eyes also by their cleerness. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
The black Spot in the midst of the Eye is the Christalline 
humor in which the Visive Vertue resides, that 
round about it, being of many colours is called the Iris, 
or in plain English the Rain-bow, this indeed contains 
in it all colours, for if we had not all colours within 
our Eye, we could not discern them without, and that's 
the Reason shutting our Eyes a little makes us see the 
[^p.29^] 
better because it reflects the Beams back to the Iris, 
where they are recruited, there the cleerer you perceive 
the Iris to be, the stronger the Sight is, you shall never 
find this fail; I was once to satifie my mind, where 
a Chirurgion dissected the Eye of a Sheep and the Eye 
of a Cat, because we were willing to see what reason 
might be given why the one could see better in the 
night than the other; the Reasons we found were 
these, 
 
1. The Christalline Humor of the Cats Eye was far 
cleerer. 
2. The Iris was much cleerer. 
3. The Optick Nerve also in the Cat (the difference 
between the bigness of the Beasts considered) was 
much bigger. 
4. The Optick Nerve of the Cat had two Originals at 
a great distance the one from the other, the one 
from the Cerebrum or Brain, the other from the Cerebellum 
or hinder part of the Brain. 
 
[}Chap. 27. 
Of Grayness and Blackness of 
the Eyes.}] 
 
THe Eye is Gray by reason of the greatness or splendor 
of the Christalline Humor, or else because it 
sticks out, or else because of the paucity and pureness 
of the Aqueal Humor; all these hapning together make 
a very gray Eye, and as more or fewer of them happen, 
so the Eye is more or less gray. 
 
A Black Eye is caused either by the smalness of the 
[^p.30^] 
Christalline Humor, or because it is deeply seated, or of 
the abundance or thickness of the Aqueal Humor, by 
all these or some of these it is more or less black. 
 
The Aqueal Humor, the more it is in quantity and 
the thinner in quality, the moister is the Eyes, the 
thicker it is in quality and the less in quantity the dryer 
are the Eyes. 
 
As for the Christalline Humor, the harder it is, the 
dryer is the Eye, but the softer it is, the moister. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
I am far enough from Galens Opinion in this, I cannot 
beleeve the Sight is stronger in Gray Eyes than in 
Black, but rather the contrary, neither am I of his 
Judgment of the causes of the differences in colour; If 
you look upon the Microcosm or Body of Man, I hold 
the cause to be in the Iris; if you look upon the Macrocosm 
or Book of the Creatures, we find fiery Signs arising 
at the Nativity to give Hazel Eyes which are those 
he here calls black, and so doth either Luminary when 
they are in the Horoscope, and I hope none is so Fool-ridden 
to say the Luminaries strong in the Ascendent, 
can or do ever give weak Sights. 
 
Again, I do not conceive the Aqueal Humor to be 
the cause of the moistness of the Eye, the Aqueal Humor 
is an Excrement produced by the Vitrial or Glassy 
Humor as it nourisheth the Christalline, and never 
stirs from its place to moisten the other parts of the 
Eye, but rather the Glandulæ or Kernel seated in that 
corner of the Eye next the Nose, which hold the tears, 
I suppose moistens the Eye. 
 
[^p.31^] 
[}Chap. 28. 
Of the Temperature of the 
Heart.}] 
 
VVEE come now to speak of the Temperature 
of the Heart, but before we begin take 
notice of this, That in every part when we say it is Hotter 
or Colder, or Dryer or Moister than it ought to be, 
we speak it as proper to the Part we treat about, not 
comparatively with other Parts, for the coldest Temperature 
of the Heart which can be in a living Man, is 
hotter than the hottest Temperature the Brain is capable 
of suffering. 
 
[}Chap. 29. 
Signs of the Heart overheated.}] 
 
VVHen the Heart is hotter than is fit or convenient 
for it to be, some Indications are inceperable 
and proper, as deep breathing, swiftness of Pulse, 
the man is bold and active, hot, furious, angry, and 
rash, the Breast and upper part of the Belly is rough, 
usually the heat of the Heart heats the whol Body, unless 
the Liver be very cold and withstand it; It dilates 
the Breast much, which alwaies answers to its heat, unless 
the coldness of the Brain, which is deduced along 
the Back-bone withstand it; but if the Breast be very 
broad and the Head very little, then you may be sure 
[^p.32^] 
the Heart is too hot, but if the Head be great and the 
Breast narrow, you may be certain the Breast is too 
cold; but if both be proportionable, 'tis a sign neither 
of heat nor coldness of the Heart, you must look to other 
Signs. 
 
[}Chap. 30. 
Signs of the Heart too cold.}] 
 
IF the Heart be too cold, the Pulses are less than Naturally 
they ought to be, and yet it doth not necessarily 
follow, that they should be slower or more rare, the 
Breast is little, and the colder the Heart is, the less is 
the Breast and the weaker the Pulse, the Man moves about 
his actions as though he dragged a Mill-stone after 
him, he is timorous and fearful, afraid of his own 
shadow, and hath no hairs upon his Breast: the difference 
in degree of coldness may be known by the greatness 
and smalness of these Symtoms, and this Rule will 
serve throughout the Body. 
 
[}Chap. 31. 
Signs of a dry Heart.}] 
 
A Dry Heart makes a hard Pulse, the Man is not 
very prone to anger, but when you have anger'd 
him, you will have much ado to please him again; finally, 
if the Heart be dry so is all the Body unless the 
Liver be very moist. 
 
[^p.33^] 
[}Chap. 32. 
Signs of a moist Heart.}] 
 
THe indications of moistness of the Heart are softness 
of the Pulse, they are soon angry and as soon 
pleased again, the whol Body is very moist unless the 
Liver be very dry. 
 
Thus much for the temperature of the Heart according 
to the first qualities simply taken. 
 
[}Chap. 33. 
Signs of a hot and dry Heart.}] 
 
IF the Heart be oppressed with heat and driness, the 
Pulses are great, hard, and swift, they fetch their 
Breath swiftly, and the swifter if the breadth of the 
Breast answer not equally by proportion to the heat of 
the Heart, their Breast is very rugged if they be sick, 
but if it be natural to them, it is very hairy, they are 
full of action, hasty in all things, angry and Tyrannical. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Herbs Medicinal for such as labor under this Infirmity, 
are, Borrage, Bugloss, Sorrel, Woodsorrel, Lettice, 
Purslane, &c. these and Syrups or Conserves made of 
them; also let such drop four or five drops of Oyl of 
Vitriol, or Spirit of Salt in their Drinks and shake it 
up and down before they drink it. 
 
[^p.34^] 
[}Chap. 34. 
Signs of a hot and moist Heart.}] 
 
IF moisture together with heat predominate at the 
Heart, the Mans Breast is not so rough nor hairy, 
they are quick enough to anger and Action, but not so 
cruel in their anger as if driness prevail, their Pulse is 
great, soft, swift, and frequent: If the Breast be large 
they draw their Breath very deep, if narrow, very thick, 
and their experation or letting out their Breath, is done 
with more swiftness than their inspiration or drawing 
in their Breath, such Bodies are mighty subject to Diseases 
of Putrefaction of Humors. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Things Medicinal for such, are Conserves of red 
Roses, Syrup of Violets, of Bawm and of Citron Pils, 
as also of the Juyce of Citrons and Lemmons, Preserved 
Citron Pills &c. 
 
As for Simples, Citron Seeds, Rue, Bawm, Angelica 
Roots and Leaves, Woodsorrel, the Flowers of Roses, 
Borrage, Bugloss, and Violets; (above all sweating and 
Bleeding may be commended in this infirmity) Hartshorn, 
Ivory, Scorzonera Roots, and Roots of Butter-Bur 
&c. 
 
[^p.35^] 
[}Chap. 35. 
Signs of a cold and moist Heart.}] 
 
INdications of the Heart when coldness with moisture 
abounds, are softness of the Pulse, Fearfulness 
of Mind, slowness of Body, he hath scarce Spirit enough 
to be angry, much less to fight; as for such 
things as belongs to the Breast and the rest of the Body 
you may distinguish them as you were taught before. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Much exercise is very convenient for such Bodies, I 
suppose there were but few troubled with this infirmity 
in the Spartan Common-wealth in Lycurgus his time, 
Thrashing, and cleaving Loggs is good Physick for 
them. 
 
For Medicines, Aromaticum Rosatum, and Aromaticum 
Caryophillatum, Confectio Alchermes, Mithridate, 
&c. 
 
For Simples, Rue, Angelica Roots, Nutmeg, 
Cinnamon, Saffron, Marigold Flowers, Bettony, 
Bawm, Alicampane, Rosemary Leaves and Flowers, 
cum multis aliis quæ nunc præscribere longum est. 
 
[}Chap. 36. 
Signs of a cold and dry Heart.}] 
 
THe Heart being cold and dry renders the Pulse hard 
and small, yet respiration, if the smalness of the 
Breast answer to the coldness of the Heart, is moderate 
[^p.36^] 
if the Breast be very Broad 'tis rare and slow, above all 
men these are least prone to anger, but once anger them 
and they will never care for you more, there is not one 
of a hundred of them that hath any Hair of his Breast. 
 
Take this common Notion in all this we have written 
or shall write concerning this Subject, That we 
when we speak of the Conditions of Men, speak of 
them barely as they are Natural and ingrafted in Man, 
not as they are amended by Phylosophy or Education. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Conserves of Roses, Borrage, Bugloss, and Rosemary 
Flowers is very good for such; as also Marigold Flowers, 
Saffron, green Walnuts preserved, Juniper Berries, 
Bettony, Candied Citron Pills, &c. 
 
[}Chap. 37. 
Signs of a hot Liver.}] 
 
THe Indications of a hot Liver, are, bigness of the 
Veins, abundance of red Choller, viz. Choller 
addust, the Belly and Bowels are rough, and the Blood 
hot; also the whol Body is distempered with heat unless 
the coolness of the Heart hinder. 
 
[}Chap. 38. 
Signs of a cold Liver.}] 
 
THe coldness of the Liver is known by narrowness 
of the Veins, abundance of Flegm, the whol Constitution 
of the Body is cold, idle and lazy, unless the 
[^p.37^] 
Heart be all the hotter, the Bowels and Belly, Viz. 
The Region of them is smooth. 
 
[}Chap. 39. 
Signs of a dry Liver.}] 
 
A Dry Liver causeth thick Blood, and but a little of 
it; the Veins are hard, the whol Body is dry, 
and needs must if the Liver that makes the Blood which 
nourisheth it be so. 
 
[}Chap. 40. 
Signs of a moist Liver.}] 
 
A Moist Liver gives abundance of Blood, but there 
is much water amongst it, the Veins are soft and 
so is all the Body unless the Heat of the Heart withstand 
it. 
 
Thus much for the qualities of the Liver considered 
as Simple by themselves and not commixed with one another. 
 
[}Chap. 41. 
Signs of a hot and dry Liver.}] 
 
THe Indications of the Liver when it is hotter and 
drier than it ought to be, are, The Bowels are 
rough, the Blood thick and dry, soundly pestered with 
[^p.38^] 
Choller, it is yellow Choller in youth, but black or addust 
Choller in age, the party is subject to dry Scabs, 
the Veins are large and hard, and although the Heat of 
the Heart may withstand the coldness of the Liver, yet 
cannot the moisture of the Heart withstand the driness 
of the Liver, for the driness of the Heart is sooner overcome 
by the moisture of the Liver, than the driness 
of the Liver by the moisture of the Heart. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Herbs Medicinable are Liverwort, Strawberry and 
Violet Leaves, Raisons of the Sun, Endive, Succory, 
Fumitory, Water-Lillies, Lettice, Purslain, Night-shade, 
these or any of these, or others like them in operation, 
are excellent to boyl in clarified Whey in the 
Summer time. 
 
Also the Compounds of them, Syrups or Conserves 
made of them: as also Dandelyon, Scabious, Devils 
bit, Scurvy-grass, Groundsel, Peach Leaves, Dyers 
Weed, Furs Flowers &c. 
 
[}Chap. 42. 
Signs of a Hot and Moist Liver.}] 
 
IF the Liver be hot and moist, the Bowels are not so 
rough as when it is hot and dry, they abound exceedingly 
with Blood, their Veins are large, the habit of 
their Body hot and moist, unless the heat of the Heart 
spoil all. 
 
If these two Qualities surpass the Bounds of Nature 
and Mediocrity, presently comes a Disease of Putrefaction, 
of corrupt Humors, if moisture abound more 
than heat, of adustion of Blood, if heat abound more 
than moisture. 
 
[^p.39^] 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
This Temper of the Liver keeping a due decorum 
makes a pure Sanguine Complexion, as the former did 
a Chollerick, for all Complexions, or at least such as 
people call Complexion, comes from the Liver. 
 
If the qualities of the Liver abound, Bleeding and 
Sweating is your Cure; afterward if your Liver be too 
hot you may cool it as you were taught before, if too 
cold, you may heat it as you shall be taught hereafter. 
 
[}Chap. 43. 
Signs of a Cold and Moist Liver.}] 
 
THe Indications of a Liver, colder and moister than 
it ought to be, gives smooth and slick Bowels, the 
Veins are narrow, the colour pale, and the Blood is filled 
with Flegm, the whol Body if the heat of the Heart 
hinder not, is full of Flegm, lazy, idle, dull, fat and 
plump. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Here you have the Description of a Flegmatick Complexion 
wherein if you perceive Flegm exceed the due 
limits of reason, you may thus correct the cold and 
moist temper of the Liver that so it may breed better 
Blood. 
 
Troches of Maudlin and Wormwood, or either of 
them (you may find the way to make them in my 
Translation of the London Dispensatory) are very good 
for such a one to carry about him, and now and then 
to eat a little; also to drink a Decoction of Guajacum, 
with the like weight of Raisons of the Sun, especially 
if a Dropsie be feared, as often is upon such a distemper. 
[^p.40^] 
For Simples you may use Cinnamon, Galanga, 
Agrimony, Harts-tongue, Maudlin, Wormwood: A 
draught of Wormwood Beer is a good Mornings 
Draught for such people; Water-crestes, Hysop, Spicknard, 
Fennel, Origanum, Centaury, Betony, Chamomel 
&c. 
 
[}Chap. 44. 
Signs of a cold and dry Liver.}] 
 
IF the Liver be too cold and dry, so is the Body also, 
because it is nourished by the Liver, the Veins are 
smal, the Blood little, and the Body lean. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Galen hence for a while, gives you Signs of the general 
Constitution of the Body, and I shall piece in with 
my might with him there, I added nothing here to his 
briefness for that cause. 
 
If the Liver be colder and drier than it ought to be, 
the Body is Melancholly, and consuming, you may take 
this Pro confessio, in such a case you must proceed thus; 
 
1. Eye the Spleen, for there must needs be a fault 
either there, or a stopping in that Branch of the Vena 
Porta, which carries the Melancholly Juyce to it: you 
may strengthen and amend that with Calamint, Capers 
and Caper Bark, Tamaris and Tamaris Bark, Bettony 
Wall-flowers, Wormwood, Dodder, Hartstongue, Epithimum; 
If you think the Spleen be too hot, use Endive, 
Succory, Lettice, and Liverwort. 
 
2. Eye the Heart, for all Melancholly vapors afflict 
that especially, the way how to do it you have in the 36. 
Chapter. 
 
[^p.41^] 
3. Restore the consumed Flesh, and Snails are the 
best things that I know for it, for Man being made of 
the slime of the Earth, all slimy things restore his Nature 
when it languisheth, and therefore they play the 
wise men indeed, if a man may speak by contraries, that 
first purge away the slime of the Snails before they use 
them. 
 
[}Chap. 45. 
Signs of a hot, cold, moist, and dry 
Temperature of the Testicles.}] 
 
THe hotter the Testicles are, the proner is the Man 
to Venery, the more Boys he gets, his Privities 
are soon Hairy, judg the clean contrary by a cold temperature 
of those Parts; moisture of the Testicles 
makes much and watry Seed, but driness of those Parts 
gives but little Seed and that little is dry. 
 
[}Chap. 46. 
Signs of a hot and dry temperature 
of the Testicles.}] 
 
THe Seed Procreative of such people, is hot, dry, and 
thick, yet most fruitful, and engenders usually 
the strongest Children, such people be they Men or 
Women it matters not much, are very prone to Venery, 
they have soon Hair about their Privities, and the 
[^p.42^] 
Parts about them, even to their Navil upwards, and 
the midst of their Thighs downward, but as they are 
prone to Venery, so are they soon satisfied, and are offended 
with compulsion to that sport. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
If you perceive too much heat in those Parts, for 
omne nimium vertitur in vicium, use cooling Herbs, as 
Endive, Succory, Housleek, Lettice, Plantane, Purslane, 
these clarified in Whey are very good and wholsom; 
as also, Roses, Water Lillies, Cucumers, the 
Seeds of Cucumers, and Melones, of Poppies both 
white and black &c. 
 
[}Chap. 47. 
Signs of a hot and moist temperature 
of the Testicles.}] 
 
IF moisture be joyned to heat of the Testicles, as it 
is in many People of a Sanguine Complexion, they 
are not so full of hair about their Privities as the former 
are, they abound more in Seed, yet is not their 
Appetite to Copulation so great, they suffer less detriment 
by the often use of the Act than the former do, 
for in deed and in truth they receive more detriment by 
abstinence from the Act, than by operating in it. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
I take this to be the Temperature the Testicles 
should be of, and therefore it is needless to prescribe 
Remedies, only I care not greatly if here I be a little 
critical against the Colledg of Physitians, it comes so 
pat in my way I know not well how to avoid it, and 
[^p.43^] 
therefore harken to me that God may hearken to you. 
 
Is not Seed of Man (take Man for both Sexes as the 
Latins take Homo, and the Greeks [^GREEK OMITTED^]) Is not 
I say the Seed of Man hot and moist, which is the Causa 
Formans of the Child? is not the Mothers Blood 
whereof the Child is formed, naturally hot and moist 
also? is not the Cell of the Womb in which the Child 
is formed, hot and moist? were your wits then a wool-gathering, 
or did you dream waking, when you wrote 
in your Book of the Rickets that a Child newborn before 
its Complexion be altered by any Medium is cold 
and moist of Constitution: I pray if ever your Book 
deserve another Impression let that be amended, or else 
defaced with a Deleatur for an Error of the first Magnitude. 
 
[}Chap. 48. 
Signs of a cold and moist temperature 
of the Testicles.}] 
 
THe Indications of a cold and moist temperature of 
the Testicles are, smoothness and moisture about 
those parts, averseness to the Sports of Venus, they 
care not whether ever they come to that School or not, 
the Seed is thin, watry, and unfruitful, and either produceth 
no Conception at all, or else but a weakly, sickly 
puny Girl at the best. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
This hath need enough of Remedy in whomsoever 
is afflicted by it, let such eat the quantity of a Nutmeg 
of Diasutyrion every morning, you may have it at the 
[^p.44^] 
Apothecaries, or if you please to make use of my Translation 
of the London Dispensatory, you have there the 
way how to make it your selves. 
 
As for Simples, Rocket, Nettle Seeds, Burnet, 
Mugwort, Penyroyal, Lovage, the Roots of Satyrion, 
Maddir, and Eringo, the Berries of Bay, and Juniper, 
Nutmegs; for Herbs, Peony, Sinkfoyl, and Mother 
or Time, Calaminth, Featherfew and Rue. 
 
[}Chap. 49. 
Signs of a cold and dry temperature 
of the Testicles.}] 
 
THe Seed is thick and very little. 
 
[}Culpeper.}] 
 
Such People usually love their Study better than the 
Sheets, you may remedy it with such Food as are Naturally 
hot and windy, and by eating such Creatures 
as are lustful and fruitful, as Crabs, Lobsters, Shrimps, 
Sparrows, Quails, Partriches, Eggs, the Stones of 
Cocks and Lambs, you have plenty enough of them in 
my Directory for Midwives. 
 
As for Simples we advised before, Pease and Beans 
are good for such; as also Parsnips and Skirrets, Figs; 
Pinenuts, Galanga, &c.
