[}The effect of the same.}] 
 
1 First, he sheweth the curation of Vlcers that bee not 
malignant and stubburne. 
 
2 Secondlie, he sheweth what manner of Medicines the 
Emperikes haue found out to ingender flesh. 
 
3 Thirdlie, he sheweth the curation of a hollow vlcer. 
 
4 Fourthlie, he sheweth that the Indications ought to 
be taken of the temperament of the affected part. 
 
5 Fiftlie, he sheweth that the curation of the similer 
parts consisteth in the iust temperame~t of the foure qualities. 
 
6 Sixthe, hee sheweth that all bodies require not lyke 
medicines, but that weake and tender bodies require most 
gentle medicines, and that drie and strong bodies require 
most strongest medicines. 
 
[^f.41v^] 
[}The first Chapter.}] 
 
IF therefore Hiero, the indication which first 
springeth of y=e= nature of y=e= thing, doth find out 
what is to be done, then y=e= beginning of finding 
out remedies, must of necessitie be take~ 
of the nature of diseases the~selues. For truly 
it is against all reason, that one thing should 
shew the waie of curing, and another that is cured, for each 
thing can better shew of himselfe, than of another, but this 
shall be made more euident heereafter. And for because all 
men do graunt the first indications to be taken of y=e= affects, 
we shall not neede further trauaile heerein, to proue that 
heereof we must take our beginning: nay, rather let vs goe 
about to shew that it is neither the whole, neither any great 
portion, as the Methodicians doe iudge, but rather the least 
part, and onely the beginning. Therefore they themselues 
doe affirme, that the stone in the bladder, (because that it is 
altogether against nature) doth shew that it must be taken 
awaie. In like sort Acrochordonas, Mirmicias, Atheromata, 
Steatomata, Meliceridas, and other of like kind. Also the 
intestine that is now fallen into the purse of the testicles, 
and all that are dislocated, because they are in a place against 
nature, they shewe that they must be reposed and 
put in their naturall seate. And all these trulie are so farre 
from anie cunning, that they are manifest euen to euerie 
priuate person, for they will bidde that the member which 
they perceiue dislocated, to be put into the ioynt agayne. 
Also Achrocordonas or Warts to be taken awaie, an Ulcer 
to be brought to a Cicatrize, and a fluxible bellie to bee 
stopped, but by what meanes those thinges may bee done, 
trulie they doe not knowe. And this is it which ought to 
bee knowen of the Phisition: wherefore the indication 
which is taken of diseases, is onelie the beginning, (and as 
I may tearme it) the place from whence the waie of curing 
proceedeth, beeing yet no portion of the arte of Physicke, 
or no great or proper parte, but such a one as is common to 
[^f.42r^] 
euerie vulgar person: therefore he is worthilie called a curer 
of diseases, that can of himselfe finde out those thinges, 
by which may be performed that which is of the first indication 
shewed, which if he doe it by experience, then he is to 
be named, an obseruer, and an Emperike. But if he doe it 
by a certaine reason and methode, then he is to be called a 
Logitian, Methoditian, and Dogmatist. Now there commeth 
to the Phisition a vulgar person, (I must repeate this 
thing againe) willing him to put the me~ber into the ioynt, 
or perhaps to vnite and forme a broken bone, or to haue 
Meliceris taken awaie. But by what waies, anie of these 
things are to be brought to passe, that to find out, is certainlie 
the office of the art of Phisicke. And the Emperikes do 
boldlie contend, that all things are to be found out by experience, 
but we trulie doe affirme, that they are found out 
partlie by experience, and partlie by reason, seeing that neither 
experience onelie, neither yet reason, can finde out all 
thinges. Notwithstanding we think it not good to set out a 
confused and mixed doctrine, but Experience by it selfe and 
Reason by it selfe, that thereby it may easilie appeare of 
what force each of them is. 
 
And now trulie we haue determined to speake of that 
inuention which springeth of Reason: now therefore haue 
we anie method following, how we may finde out euerie 
of the forenamed remedies? I meane to take awaie that 
which is altogether against Nature, and that is dislocated, 
to put in his proper place, and to vnite the solution of continuitie, 
shall we require experience heereto? I trulie am 
fullie perswaded, that ther is a method, by which thou maist 
finde out things required, whose originall is that, which 
euerie disease doth shewe to bee done. For the solution of 
vnitie, requireth vnition: and the fracture of the bone, called 
in Greeke, Catagma, in the fleshie parts, an vlcer: like as also 
a wound and ruption, called Regma, and conuulsion, named 
Spasma: for a wound truelie is a certaine solution, 
lefte in the fleshie parte of wounding. A ruption 
and conuulsion, bee solutions made without wounding. 
 
[^f.42v^] 
The first is diuision of the fleshie partes, the other is of 
the neruous parts, & all these shew that there must be made 
vnion, but whether in all it may be performed, or y=t= it cannot 
in many, that onelie behooueth the Artist to consider, for 
no common person doth know how that the Diaphragma, or 
the smal intenstines, can attain the scope, of which they giue 
indication: also he is ignorant that the foreskin called Periputium, 
and the thin part of the cheeks, be of lyke condition. 
Furthermore, whether Caries in the bone (the Greekes call 
it Teridon) may be cured, like as erosion in the flesh, he vnderstood 
not. Againe, whether a fracture will grow together 
like as a wound, or doth further require to be adconglutinated 
with Callus, he perceiueth not whether there is 
to be hoped the growing of Callus in fractures of the head, or 
else is otherwise to be cured. Further, he is more ignorant 
whether there is anie hope of recouerie in wounds of the 
heart, lungs, stomacke, and liuer. And to conclude, no common 
person knoweth anie thing beyond the first indication. 
Therfore the first worke of this art is, to consider whether 
we may performe that we take in hand, or not, and this is 
knowen two waies, neither can the third be added or knowen. 
The first is, by experience, which requireth long vse & 
practise: the other is, by the nature of the thing it selfe, for 
this doth set out both the substance of euerie part, and also 
his action, vse, and scituation, with which things proceeding, 
he shall not onelie foresee what cannot be cured, but also deliberate 
of inuenting remedies for that which maye bee 
cured. 
 
[}The second Chapter.}] 
 
THerefore it is manifest that we must begin of simple 
things, and truelie there is nothing more simple than 
the wound in the vpper part of the flesh: therefore the 
cure of this wound, in that it is onelie a wound, is 
vnition, but if it be with hollownesse and putrefaction, 
there is a double scope, in as much as the effect is double, 
that is to saie, an vlcer, which is, solution of vnitie, 
[^f.43r^] 
and hollownesse which springeth of the lost substance of the 
part, in which kinde it cannot often chance, that thou shalt 
fulfill both the scopes aforesaid, as if not onlie the flesh, but 
also the bone vnder it is perisheth, for such hollownesse cannot 
exactlie be filled, but you may bring it to a cicatrise, but 
this is the cure of the vlcer, and the hollownesse remaineth 
notwithstanding vncurable: Therfore this thing it behoueth 
to know, either by experience, or else by reasons help. 
But Thessalus vseth not these, neither putteth he to a third, & 
yet is not he ashamed to trifle, but let y=t= passe, & rather let 
y=e= Phisition who followeth Thessalus, teach vs how to cure 
a hollow vlcer in the fleshie part, nothing being hurt vnder 
y=e= vlcer, he answereth, by applying medicines which do engender 
flesh, they call them Sarcoticall. Well said, a greate 
facilitie, peraduenture you may better tearme it, stupiditie, 
when he thinketh sufficientlie to haue answered the question, 
by naming a sarcoticall medicine: for if we know this 
Sarcoticall, what doe we further require, shew vs I praie 
thee what Sarcoticall is, that thou wilt vse: I suppose that 
thou wilt answere, Olibanum, or Iris, or Aristolochia, or Eruifarina 
or Panax, for I will first make mention of drie medicines: 
now go to. By what meanes hast thou found these 
medicines? thou answerest by Experience, what is it then 
that thou hast added heereto? for euerie person doth know, 
that that which is holow, must be filled, but experience hath 
taught of what things, and by what medicines that should 
be done: trulie Thessalus knoweth not that medicine, neither 
as an emperike, neither as a logitian: as an emperike 
because he will not: as a Logitian, because he cannot: for 
I trulie doe vnderstand, that he knoweth this medicine as 
an Emperike, for seeing there are two instruments of euerie 
inuention, that is to saie, Experience & Reason, he which 
doth know that is inuented, and yet can giue no reason 
thereof, doth shew himselfe to haue found it by experience, 
therfore y=t= he may vnderstand how greatlie he hath erred, 
let him a little giue audience vnto vs, for I will haue to 
doe in fewe wordes, with the professour of onelie Experience, 
for it is meete that he also do vtter by what meanes 
[^f.43v^] 
he hath found out this drying medicine that dooth incarnate, 
which hee nameth Cephalicin, and that is compound 
of Iris, and Aristolochia, and Eruus, & Olibanum, and Manna, 
that is to saie, the drosse of Olibanum. There is also another 
medicine, which besides these that are rehearsed, hath 
the rinde of Panax, and another medicine to, which is mixed 
with washed Cadmia. 
 
Now let him tell me how these medicines be found, but 
what skilleth it (saith he) to aske of y=e= finding of the~ out, is it 
not better to vse those things that are found out right? And 
this at the first they answere, afterward they saie, that these 
medicines be found out by dreames, in the meane time by 
chaunce one medicine was put to another, afterward one 
was bolde to vse them mixed, but yet they shewe not the 
successe of their boldnesse. Therefore these be manifest trifles. 
The third waie of inuention, trulie is reason, or some 
prouing euerie one of those simple medicines separatlie, to 
be Sarcoticall, afterward beholding y=t= sometime it doth not 
make flesh, he findeth out by reason, that euerie one of those 
agreeth not to euerie nature, for vnto whome Aristolochia 
doth not fill the vlcer with flesh, there Olibanum hath, and 
where Olibanum hath not profited, there Iris hath done 
good, for I suppose that to be reasonable, that all men are not 
affected to all things alike. And when this came first into 
reasoning, it was thought good that many medicines of one 
kinde should be mixed together, that there might not want 
a meete medicine for euerie nature. And friend, the action 
of euerie substaunce doth not remaine in mixed kindes, so 
that in euerie kinde of bodie, there might be present that 
should helpe the disease, for if they coulde finde out the nature 
of the bodie, or the force of the Medicine applyed, peraduenture 
there should not neede such varietie in them, in 
as much as they shoulde alwaie readelie finde that one medicine 
that should agree to one bodie. 
 
Now for as much as they are ignorant in both, they doe 
crookedlie mixe all together, studying to make one medicine 
that might agree to all natures, and I suppose this reason 
of compounding medicines to be found out of the first Phisitions, 
[^f.44r^] 
and you receiue it as an auncient inuention, notwithstanding 
I suppose that it is not so farre from the true 
medicinall method, as it is reasonable to be emptied into another, 
for if they doe not first thinke of that method, whose 
composition standeth in medicines like of kinde, and not of 
that which is of contrarie, by and by you shall finde in the 
mixture of these medicines, some one that may be profitable 
to the sicke, and peraduenture not one: contrariwise, seauen 
or eight which shall not need, so that the medicines shal 
more hurt that profit. 
 
These thinges I saie, if he doeth not remember, I 
will account him more ignoraunt than to knowe the 
thing it selfe, for oyle being put into a hollowe wound, 
is most contrarie of all other medicines, for if thou wilt 
that waie cure, thou shalt by vse finde the vlcer to be filthy 
and stinking, but if the time also of the yeere be hotter, or y=e= 
man hath Cachochimia, or by nature is apt vnto rumes, or 
offend in his diet, it is to be feared least y=t= part do putrifie, in 
which the vlcer is made. In like sort, if thou doest vse waxe 
either alone, either dissolued in oyle, for they trulie do make 
the vlcer putrifie: but if thou doe put in Aerugo beaten 
fine, they shall by no meanes putrifie, yet it bringeth great 
paine and corrosion. 
 
Furthermore, it doth eate and prouoke inflammation, 
and if thou vse it more largelie, it will also make conuulsion, 
therefore seeing that neither oyle, nor Aerugo, nor wax, 
can fill an hollow vlcer with flesh, it is manifest that none 
of those which professeth onelie Experience, will mixe them 
together, yet I trulie will mixe them, yea, in due waight, 
not onelie these, but a thousand other medicines, which bee 
not hurtfull to a hollow vlcer, for if they not hurt not with the 
same faculties, but as it were with their contraries, trulie 
they are vnlike and immoderate to fill an hollowe vlcer: 
notwithstanding like as of too immoderate temperatures, 
there shall bee one made temperate, that wee haue set out 
in the waie of compounding medicines: therefore it is not 
hard to make a medicine of oyle, waxe, and Aerugo, that 
shall make flesh, for if thou doest know that the same vlcer 
[^f.44v^] 
is moderatlie to be dried, and doest not vnderstand the wax 
or oyle doth not drie, neither that anie of them, or both mixt 
together, can fill a hollow vlcer, nor that Aerugo alone can 
moderatlie drie: therefore if thou doest mixe all these together, 
thou maist make a medicine which shall moderatlie 
drie, what the quantitie or proportion of euerie one of them 
should be, that I haue now set out in my bookes, which be 
entituled, the composition of medicines, and nowe also if it 
be needfull, it shall be declared in talke heereafter. 
 
But first we must driue from these our bookes following, 
this Thessalus, but first declaring vnto him, howe much hee 
hath erred fro~ a truth, for vnto anie that is wise, that which 
is now spoken, doth sufficientlie shew what the methode of 
curing ought to be, but with these we need not talke. Therfore 
it is necessarie that we dispute yet with those, taking 
heere our beginning. 
 
Euerie hollownesse that is against nature, doth require 
to be filled, wherefore also that which commeth in the fleshy 
part, and that filling in the end, of finding out remedies, 
which we desire. And that thou maist finde those remedies, 
which doe fill, thou hast neede of much reason and manifold 
indication, and exact, reasonable, and perticular method, for 
thou hast often seene vlcers harde to cure, not to be cured, 
neither of those which professe experience, I meane those 
which abound in remedies, neither of those, which claiming 
reason to themselues, for these Thessalians, who~ they name, 
Methodicians, being indeede most farre from a methode, as 
the Asse to the Harp, be vnmeete to heare this speculation, 
much lesse cure, they find out by reason, that which is right? 
Thou hast seene many times in the like vlcers, the Emperikes 
to goe from one medicine to another, when truelie 
no reason did shewe them the waie, because they haue 
tried manye thinges which may fill a hollowe vlcer, the 
same as they call it, Idiosyncrasian, that is, properties of bodies, 
in which euerie of them are seene to haue force, neyther 
can they discerne, neyther yet remember. Therefore now 
also, not knowing whether to goe, but trusting in the 
proofe of many perticulars, whatsoeuer they finde by the 
[^f.45r^] 
waie y=e= may profit, they goe from one to another, following 
Fortune rather than Reason, which may help in the inuention 
of remedies, like vnto these, although they will not be 
these Dogmatists, which are not able by reason to vnderstand 
the naturall principles of bodies, but of these Thessalions 
voide of method, what doest thou yet speake? Therefore 
those which cure by right method, doe finde apt remedies 
for euerie kinde of vlcers, as also conuenient diet, they 
do most apparantlie declare by the things it self, how much 
it profiteth, and how great light it doth bring to the arte of 
curing, the Treatise of nature it selfe declareth: for I haue 
not once declared vnto you, how that sometime they which 
goe from one medicine to another, doe let slip and neglect 
that which is profitable, and that with some one of their remedies, 
which they haue vsed, the same vlcers haue beene 
cured, therefore they haue worthilie despised the facultie 
of such remedies, which because of the vntimelie vse, they 
haue seene, not onelie the profite, but much for to hurt, and 
that in the first vse it hath done no euident thing. Furthermore, 
thou hast seene no lesse the grieuous pains of the eies 
to be healed, either with bath, either with drinking of wine, 
either with foments, either with letting of bloud, eyther 
with purging, vnto which these common sort of Phisitions 
haue applied no other thing, than these medicines which 
are made of Opium, and Mandrake, and Henbane, bringing 
great daunger vnto the eies, inasmuch as they taking no 
other thing awaie for y=e= present but the paines it selfe: these 
doe kill the sence, as thou hast knowen many, by the vse of 
these medicines, when they have bene too much applied, 
neuer after to haue come to their naturall state, and that 
first their eyes were dim, and they haue hardly seene, after 
to be vexed with suffusion (which is called Hipochysis) 
or with too greate dilatation of the ball of the Eie, named 
Mydriasis, or with Tabes or Corrugation, called 
Rhetiosin. 
 
Thou hast knowen also, being with me from sixteene 
yeeres of age, neuer to haue seene vnder anie maister this 
worke, but to haue excogitated it by reason, and how long 
[^f.45v^] 
time I did consider that Aphorisme, of vnalayde wine, or 
barly, or foment, or letting bloud, or purging, taketh away 
the paines of the eyes. And what trust I had by the rest of 
Hippocrates laborers, that there was nothing in this Aphorisme, 
either false or might not be brought to passe, & that 
was it which stirred mee to search, vntill (going Hippocrates 
way) I found by what meanes I should discerne, when 
and how, euery of the forenamed should be vsed. By which 
reason I made manifest to many, which haue seene the like 
things, of how great force the medicinall methode is, and 
how great occasion of euill they are, which haue not obserued 
the olde arte of Phisicke, haue builded new sectes, 
and now truely, although from the beginning I haue refused 
it, yet by entreating, you haue compelled mee to take al 
this whole worke in hand, which I pray the gods may be 
profitable, by others truely I haue small hope, as well for 
the contempt of good letters, which now do raigne, as also 
for the admiration of riches, estimation and ciuill power, 
vnto which whosoeuer doe turne himselfe, is not able to 
finde the truth in any thing: But these things shall be determined 
as pleaseth the gods, and we now for our power, 
shal restore the Methode of curing, which was found of the 
auncient Phisitians, being now neglected: repeting againe 
the disputation which we haue begunne of the hollow vlcer, 
and of the first inuention of those things, which doth fill 
an vlcer with flesh, let that suffise, which hitherto we haue 
saide, and let vs graunt if they will, vnto the Empericks 
all that they say. And for the vse of things fou~d out, I haue 
often shewed to thee in themselues, and now nothing lesse, 
I will go about to demonstrate by reason, how these Empericks, 
cannot by certaine reason, go vnto another medicine, 
whe~ they haue nothing profited with the first, and that 
rightly chaunceth: for when as they know not the cause, of 
the vnhappie successe of the first medicine, neither can declare 
the lyke in the second, and when they are ignorant of 
the cause, wherefore the first medicine doth not his affect, 
neither are able to vndersta~d, why it taketh no place, this 
thing truely being not knowen, they cannot reasonably go 
[^f.46r^] 
to another, when as they cannot in the same medicine perceiue 
the like cause. 
 
[}The third Chapter.}] 
 
NOw therfore let vs set out Hyppocrates waie, and the 
true method of curing an hollow vlcer, surelie it behoueth 
to begin thus, that is, of the substance of the thing, 
therefore seeing that an hollow vlcer that is our scope, that y=e= 
flesh whcih is lost may be restored, it is needfull to knowe 
that the thing which engendereth flesh, is good bloud, nature 
as I may tearme it, being the workman and author, notwithstanding 
it is not sufficient to name simplie Nature, 
vnlesse we consider also whose nature, and where. For it is 
manifest, that Nature it selfe is the ingenderer of flesh, of 
those bodies that be subiect, whereas flesh is to be made, and 
surelie it is declared, that the nature of euerie bodie doeth 
consist of the temperament of hot, cold, moist, and drie: therefore 
it is manifest, that the iust temperament of these, in 
those parts whereas we shall restore the lost flesh, is as it 
were the workman. And first of all, in euerie hollow vlcer, 
these two things are to be considered, whether the bodie being 
subiect, be in iust temperature, that is to saie, whether it 
be according to nature. For we haue declared, that health 
of similer bodies, is the iust temperature of the foure qualities, 
and whether the bloud that floweth to y=e= part be good, 
or else but indifferent, for if either of these doe offend, there 
are trulie many affects against nature, notwithstanding 
there is now put to vs but onlie the hollownesse in the fleshie 
parts. Therefore let vs imagine the part to be sound, 
and the bloud which floweth to the parte, to be free from 
fault, either in qualitie or quantitie, surelie these thinges 
beeing, as is sayde, there is no impediment, but that flesh 
shall prosperouslie growe, and that without the helpe of anie 
outwarde medicine, for both causes which ingender 
flesh, beeing present, and nothing outwardlie hindering, 
then it cannot bee, but that flesh must bee ingendered. 
 
[^f.46v^] 
But in the first engendering of flesh, there must of force 
spring a double excrement, as we haue shewed in our commentaries 
of Nature, that there followeth euerie mutation 
of the qualitie of the nourishment, an excrement grose and 
thicke, and another thin. And these excrementes chauncing 
euer through the whole bodie, that which is thinner, is inuisible, 
by perspiration, not withstanding it is forthwith visible, 
as often as the naturall heate diminisheth, or that hee 
vseth more large diet than is meete, or that there happeneth 
to the creature more vehement motion. The other excrement 
is the filth, that is sent to the skin. Furthermore, in 
vlcers, the thinner excrement is called Sanies, in Greeke Icor, 
the groser is named Sordes, and the vlcer is made moist 
by the thinner excrement, in like sort as by the groser it is 
made filthie, and for that cause it needeth two kind of medicines, 
that is to saie, exicatiues, to expell or drie y=t= which 
is moist, and mundificatiues, to purge the filth. 
 
Now then, seeing that nature ceaseth no time, truelie 
there can be no time found, in which both these excrements 
may not be gathered together in an hollow vlcer: Wherefore 
there shall be no time in which thou shalt not vse both 
kindes of medicines, that is to saie, which shall exicate and 
mundifie. 
 
And now we haue found out of what kinde the medicine 
ought to be, but that is not sufficient, for it is needfull 
to inuent some perticular, which is to be applied to the vlcer. 
Now by what method, and howe shall they be found 
out? forsooth by the same which is set out in our bookes, of 
the faculties of simple medicamentes, for we haue shewed 
in them certaine medicines desiccatiue, certaine humectiue, 
certaine refrigeratiue, and certaine to make hot, yea, 
and certaine by coniunction, to make hot and drie, or to refrigerate 
and moist, or to heate and moist, or to refrigerate 
and drie, and that there is in euerie of them a difference, 
more or lesse, but in multitude infinite. 
 
Notwithstanding they be contained within limites to 
their vse, which doe easilie comprehend them in the first order 
or degree, or second, or third, or fourth, now of what degre~e, 
[^f.47r^] 
shall that medicine be, which is meete to enge~der flesh, 
which must both moderately dry, and also mundifie? truely 
of y=e= first degr~e, for that medicine, which surmounteth this 
degre~e, doth not onely co~sume the abou~daunce of the humor 
flowing to the part, but doth also deuoure the bloud flowing, 
letting the part to be restored co~suming the flesh, or the 
matter wherof the flesh groweth: surely it is declared that 
such be Olibanum, and the meale of barly, beanes & Eruum, 
and Iris, and Aristolochia, and Cadmia, and Panax, & Pomphilix, 
and we haue shewed y=t= all these, differ among themselues, 
more or lesse, and that some of them abound onely 
in simple qualities and other some in compound. For Aristolochia, 
and Panax, doe drye more than the rest, and also 
by nature are more hot, barley and bean flower, doth much 
lesse drye than these, and haue no heate at all. 
 
Olibanum, doth moderately heate, but doth lesse dry tha~ 
these, in so much as in certaine bodies, it dryeth not at all. 
The meale of Eruum, and Iris, and Aristolochia, and Panax, 
are in a meane. But now let vs repeate againe, that wee 
haue profitably touched. 
 
Olibanum, in bodies of moist nature, is able to engender 
flesh, but in dry natures he cannot, for it is needefull to 
consider, that there is a two folde difference of the first indicatio~s, 
that which is according to nature, shewing the co~seruation 
of it selfe, & further doth also require things lyke 
to it selfe, and that which is against nature, declaring the 
taking away of it selfe, and also requiring things contrary: 
for euery thing perisheth or is ouercome of his contrary, and 
in his contrary. And truely the Ulcer, how much it is to 
moist, doth so much the more require medicines, which doth 
drye. But the nature of y=e= bodie how much it is more moist, 
so much the lesse it requireth a medicine which doth excicate, 
wherefore if there be any vlcers in which there is like 
humiditie, because they are in a bodie of dryer te~perament, 
truely it is requisite the more to be excicate: that which is 
in a moister temperature, doeth so much lesse neede 
drye medicines, as there is difference betweene nature and 
nature. For it behoueth the flesh that is engendred, to be 
[^f.47v^] 
like that which was there before. Therefore whereas the 
flesh is dryer than in times past, it is conuenient that the 
new be made dryer, so that it ought to be the more largely 
to be dryed, & how much the more it shall be drye, so much 
the more shall the medicine which shalbe applyed, haue a 
dissicatiue vertue: but in a moist nature, there is so much 
lesse neede of a medicine dissicatiue, how much the flesh is 
lesse drye. Therefore like as Olibanum, hath such temperament 
co~cerning the nature of mans bodie, y=t= is agreeable to 
a temperate & meane nature, but it doth somewhat more 
largely drye. These that be moyster in like sort, as it is to 
moist for them that be most drye, so that of right Olibanum 
maketh mattier, both in certaine Ulcers and also natures, 
& doth not engender flesh, and in certaine it doth engender 
flesh. Therefore if thou dost marke, thou shalt finde y=e= successe 
aunswerable vnto reason, for in a moister nature it 
may enge~der flesh, in a dryer it ca~not. Doest thou not therfore 
perceiue of how many Theoremes, or intencions of curing, 
he hath ne~ede, y=t= will cure an vlcer by a right Methode? 
for after y=t= it is found out, that y=e= fault is in moisture, altogither 
it sheweth foorthwith, y=t= ther must be prepared a dissicatiue 
medicine: but for y=t= there are of drying medicines, 
some y=t dryeth more, and some lesse, that which is expedient 
must be taken, partly of the diuersitie of the vlcers, & partly 
of the nature of the sicke. Therefore he y=t will rightly cure 
an vlcer, must not onely co~sider the nature of the body, but 
also to haue learned, all the speculation of medicines diligently, 
and also to know the signes of bodies, which are of 
dry or moist temperament. 
 
Now therefore consider what great rashnesse is of pronouncing 
these Methodicians, which think that they haue 
done sufficiently to the curing of an hollow Ulcer, if they 
vndersta~d that it must be filled with flesh. Truely the way 
of curing co~sisteth not in this, but in finding that out which 
shall fill it with flesh, but that shal fill with flesh (quod he) 
is alreadie founde by experience: then confesse that which 
shall cure, to be founde out by experience, neither doe they 
vainely boast, neither extoll the Methode, although experience 
[^f.48r^] 
is co~demned, yea, of the Empericks themselues, which 
is without certaine limitation: for they write in their commentaries 
of medicines, in this manner. An Emplaister for 
those that haue soft bodies, and for children and women, & 
they know how that Olibanum in such natures can engender 
flesh, and fill hollow Ulcers, so that there be no other 
accidence: notwithstanding where such bodies are moist, 
and because of their moystnesse require moderate drying 
Medicines, or that there is some other cause of the successe, 
they cannot tell. Againe they shall finde an other medicine 
written for olde folkes, and another against those Ulcers 
which will hardly be brought to a cicatrice, and hath the 
sides swollen, called in Greeke Oxthothe, and they write 
in all their co~mentaries curatiue, many other seperatiues, 
for which as neere as we can inuent a conuenient medicine, 
to the propertie of curing nature, for seperations in euerie 
Arte, go about to deuide that which is proper, from that 
which is common, and how much any doth diuide or parte 
more thinges, so much he commeth neerer vnto the propertie, 
but the proper thing it selfe, cannot exactly be either 
written or spoken: and for this cause those Emperickes 
which were most diligent in their Arte, as also well neere 
all the dogmatistes, doe acknowledge that there cannot be 
left in writing any exacte curing, but that which wanteth 
concerning the coniecture of the nature of the pacient. 
Some of them affirme, that it is to be added or considered 
of the proper vse of euery Phisition, other some by reasoning 
artificially, but yet none of them was so rash to professe, 
that he had one medicine which might engender flesh, 
in euery hollow vlcer, for truely thou shalt not finde in authours 
such a Medicine that will cure euery hollow Ulcer, 
but that the medicine is to be chaunged, according to the 
humour and temperament of the pacients member. 
Therefore wee leauing here the impudencie of the Methodicians, 
goe to, lette vs heare what the Emperickes 
saye, who doe iudge that sometyme is to be added or considered 
in the finding out proper remedies for the pacient, 
by the proper vse and exercitation of euery one, for as wee 
[^f.48v^] 
haue after sayd, there is not in phisicke any thing, or any 
remedie, which is not in fine difficil, but in euery thing his 
qualitie cannot be hidde~, for either it may be spoken, written, 
or perceiued. For in an vlcer, moisture and filthinesse, 
may be shewed, but the quantitie in neither may be shewed, 
although we studying to goe ne~erer vnto y=e= thing it selfe, 
naming it, wee say small, and plentifull filthinesse, or thin 
and grosse, or very much or little, and indiffere~t, and competent, 
or else calling it otherwise in like sort, whereby we 
may come neerer, to shew the quantitie. 
 
Now therefore I will haue thee diligent to attend, that 
thou maist know how much it is better, to doe euery thing 
by a method, rather than by experience only, be it so knowen 
that this or that medicine, hath vertue to fill an hollow 
vlcer, in those whome wee name of moyster complexion, as 
an obseruer or empericke, in those which haue soft flesh, and 
to women and children, & that he hath not now, any thing 
profited with such medicine. Therefore wee will seeke out 
the cause, why it dyd not profit, and will reduce this, vnto 
one of these two, for either the medicine hath dried to little, 
or else to much, the signes of which, be Sordes, and Sanies, for 
if there be more Sordes, in the vlcer, and that all the vlcer 
is moister, y=e= medicine hath dried to little, but if it be cleane 
and without moysture, it hath dryed to much. Therefore 
forthwith wee may know the measure also of the excesse & 
effect, by the manner of the signes, and we shall afterward 
make our medicine, which shall be applyed, so much y=e= more 
or lesse drying, but the Empericks truely if any medicine 
applyed doth not make flesh to grow, hee verely beholdeth, 
but yet being ignorant, whether that springeth because his 
medicine dryeth to little or much, he cannot go vnto another 
medicine. In like sort truely, both Erasistratus, and Herophilus, 
being as I haue shewed halfe dogmatistes, shall ill 
cure an vlcer, for they attempt to cure onely those affects by 
reason, which are proper to the organicke members, but an 
vlcer as we said, is common both to similer and also instrumentall 
parts, therefore so farre forth as it is in the similer 
partes, so farre foorth they will cure it Emperiquelie. 
 
[^f.49r^] 
Also, if they proue to cure those vlcers, whose substance is 
vtterlie perished, or else is vnperfect & diminished, in these 
also it followeth necessarilie, that they maye manifoldlie 
erre from curing reasonablie: for if that is lost by anie similer 
substaunce, it is necessarie that he who will looke to 
the restoring of this againe, be skilfull of vniversal nature. 
But of these we shall heereafter speake, in the meane season 
I suppose it to be most euidentlie set out, that euerie one 
cannot rightlie cure an vlcer, and that the first indication, 
of all which is manifest to euery priuate person, is the least 
part of curing. For it is necessarie that by demonstration 
he hath learned, how that heate and colde, moisture and 
drynesse, be qualities actiue and passiue. And further to 
know all those things which we haue written in our bookes 
De Temperaments, or else where, in other volumes belonging 
heereto. 
 
And hetherto our talke hath bene of the hollowe Ulcer, 
we onelie curing the hollownesse it selfe, for it is not 
yet set out what is the proper curation of an vlcer, but that 
shall also be performed after the same methode, because it 
is taken both of the temperament of the affected parte, and 
also of the facultie of medicines, and surelie both these doe 
depend of the Treatise of Elements, for if that be graunted, 
that in a methode the foure qualities are causes of generation 
and corruption, it shall not be lawfull either to 
haue begunne, either to proceede, or to finish a methode: for 
trulie it belongeth to the Treatise of Elements, that thou 
mayest shewe the qualities, to doe and suffer naturallie. 
Therefore that we heeretofore haue shewed, is not confirmed 
in this present talke, that no Phisition can consider of 
anie similer partes, without naturall knowledge or speculation, 
(but there is onelie set out of similer parts.) 
 
Heere now our talke doth somewhat insinuate, that neither 
in the instrumentall parts anie can finde out the perfect 
cure, which haue not attained the speculation or true 
knowledge. But this shall bee more euidentlie set out in 
the weeke. 
 
[^f.49v^] 
[}The fourth Chapter.}] 
 
BUt now it is time to go to the verie cure 
of an vlcer, which is alone or simple, the 
vlcer trulie shall be alone, of there be neither 
affect or accident present, but if the 
part vlcerate be not molested with fluxe, 
nor visited with ill iuyce, neither out of his 
naturall temperature, neither is there anie hollownesse, 
or yet losse of skin, for this thing a good sort of Phisitions 
do let slip, not vnderstanding howe there remaine two affects 
in the part, after the hollow vlcer is filled with flesh & 
made plaine, the one being the losse of the substance of the 
skin, the other, of the solution of continuitie. Therefore as 
often as this one thing commeth, that is, solution of continuitie, 
whether that be of the ouer skin, the Greekes cal it 
Epithermia, or whether it be of y=e= skin called Thermia, or it 
be the affect of the flesh vnder it, which is called an vlcer, 
it doth onelie require to be adglutinated, for if the sides of 
the skin be perfectlie ioyned together, there shal be nothing 
in the middest of a contrarie kind, like as in y=e= vlcer which 
is now filled, and is made plaine, for in this the sides of the 
vlcer touch not, but the skinne of all the exulcerate part is 
perished, which ought forsooth to be restored. But in that 
wound whereas there is diuision made with anie edged 
toole, there is onelie adglutination required, & not also the 
generation of skin. Therefore as often as we purpose to 
finde out the cure of a simple vlcer, we in this talke presuppose 
that the fleshie part is diuided, without losse of anie 
portion of the same, for it wanteth a broad skin, which 
we haue called in Greeke Epithermia, which must be made 
by inducing a ciccatrize. Therefore it is necessarie both to 
regenerate this, & also to vnite it together, & so there be two 
things vnto which thou must looke as in an hollow vlcer, 
because there is a double affect in both. But peraduenture 
some of them will saie, how is a plaine vlcer knowen from 
an hollowe if there be both a double affect in either, & also a 
[^f.50r^] 
double scope of curing appointed, that is to saie, the multitude 
of the lost parts, where in an hollow vlcer, not onelie 
the ouer skin is perished, but also the skin it selfe, yea, and 
sometime no small portion of the flesh. In an vlcer filled, 
there wanteth not flesh, but yet outwardlie there lacketh 
his couering, but we will shew heereafter what the cure is 
of those kindes of vlcers, now let vs vnderstand what is y=e= 
due cure of an vlcer, in that it is onelie an vlcer, & hath no 
other affect ioyned with it, therefore for that heere is onelie 
diuision put forth, it behoueth to ioyne the sides that are diuided, 
and not onelie to ioyne them, but to make them also 
to indure surelie, they which are ioyned shall remaine together 
two waies, when as some of themselues doth so remaine, 
other by y=e= helpe of other things, of themselues they 
onelie remaine, which doth grow together and close by the 
helpe of other, those which are gathered together, and so holden 
with anie glutenous thing, but those y=t= grow together 
must of force be naturallie soft. Trulie such is both the flesh 
it selfe, and also whatsoeuer commeth of flesh, but whatsoeuer 
are hard & drie, their parts cannot grow together, but 
doth require some glue or band, whereby the sides ioyned 
may so remaine. But the cure of such bodies shal be set out 
heereafter. Heere let vs proceede with our talke begun, of 
those which may be vnited, searching out also the cause of 
ioyning & closing, for like as in hollow vlcers there must be 
flesh ingendred, so in a simple vlcer that the sides may close. 
And nature trulie is the cause, that if thou dost exactly put 
together the sides which are separated, they wil close together 
without anie outward labour, and now there springeth 
another scope for thee, to consider the bringing of the 
sides together, beginning with which thou shalt finde out, 
with what thou shalt bring this to passe, for thou shalt 
close them together which are separated, either with a roller, 
with two ends put about, or with stitching, or hookes, 
which the Greekes call Agkleras, or with some of these, 
or else all, it is necessarie that the roller which is put 
about bee not too softe, or will bee broken lyke Alga, 
(the Greeke writers doe call it Vroupthes, that it maye 
[^f.50v^] 
safelie holde, neither yet so hard, that in compressing it may 
offend, then let not thy rolling or binding be so loose, that it 
cannot doe good, neither yet so straight, that by compressing 
it may cause dolour. These thinges if thou shalt obserue, 
without doubt the vlcer will close, if that it bee free from 
all iuyce or fluxe, or intemperatnesse, or inflamation, or anie 
other fault. But if for the greatnesse it cannot be that the 
partes diuided may from the bottome bee exactlie ioyned, 
neither being able with stitching, neither with splents, neither 
with rolling to come vnto them, or that there is Sanies 
nowe gathered there, or some dolour annexed, such an 
vlcer cannot close together by the onelie ioyning of the 
sides, when as that that is pained, causeth somewhat to 
flowe more, yea, and although that which floweth bee according 
to nature, yet the strength of the parte which are 
meekned, both for the dolour and paine, and also thorough 
the wound, cannot beare that which is iust, but are burthened, 
as though it were the contrarie, and heereof springeth 
superfluous Sanies, yea, and it is meruaile if there 
followeth not inflamation also, if there be Sanies collected 
in the middest of the sides of the vlcer, without paine, or that 
there bee anie meane place betwixt, which is voide of Sanies, 
but yet is filled with the aire, the Ulcer cannot bee adglutinated 
by closing together the partes diuided, when as 
the Sanies do deuour the vnion, and the voide places which 
are betwixt the partes to be ioyned, doe let the frontes of 
the inward sides to touch. Therefore at the least that those 
partes of the vlcer maye close, they require Natures helpe 
to bee filled with flesh, and surelie these are so little, if the 
sides of the vlcer bee rightlie ioyned, that it may be done in 
one daie, or in two at the most. Therefore for this time it 
behooueth to vse some desiccatiue medicine, which may drie 
the part, that it may consume the Sanies, if anie there bee, 
or if anie shall flowe into the voide places, to keepe it back. 
Now therfore thou shalt cause me to call to remembrance y=e= 
medicine which doth incarnate & moderatlie drie, y=t= we may 
knowe whether y=e= glutinatiue medicine ought to be drier or 
co~trary: truly y=e= incarnatiue medicine if it shuld co~sume al y=e= 
[^f.51r^] 
bloud which floweth, it should by that meanes take away 
the matter it selfe whereof flesh springeth. But truelie a 
glutinatiue medicine either needeth not at all the generation 
of flesh, or else verie little. Wherefore it behooueth it 
to be more desiccatiue than that which must incarnate, so 
that by this reason, there is but a small difference betwixt 
these medicines, but yet by another reason ther is great difference, 
in as much as that which doth incarnat, ought eftsoones 
also to haue a vertue abstersiue, whereby it may not 
onlie dry y=e= abundance of moisture, but also may take away 
all the filth: Aglutinatiue trulie neither may mundifie, neither 
purge, but to bring all the whole substaunce together. 
And medicines which be called Abstersiue and astringent, 
hath such facultie, for these surelie haue facultie to constrain 
and stop, and not to mundifie and purge _[^ORIG. BLURRED^] whereof it followeth, 
that when we studie to incarnate, we must chiefly flie 
an astringent medicine, because it fixeth y=e= filth more straitlie 
than may easilie be loosed. Therefore wine is the best 
medicine for euery vlcer, in that it is an vlcer, and if it be 
not added that it is an vlcer, I suppose thou wilt vnderstand. 
 
For it is onelie added for remembrance sake, least anie 
should thinke, not as defining anie thing necessarie, so that 
if thou shewest thy selfe mindfull of all those things, which 
in the former booke are set out, of naming euerie thing, 
and also of the subiects, there is no cause that hence forth I 
shal define such things vnto thee, it shal be abundantlie for 
me, if I onelie in euerie of them separate the simple effects 
from those that are compound, of which things I haue somwhat 
before spoken, and nowe neuerthelesse shall speake, 
not so much trulie for the things it self, as that many Phisitions 
deceiued by the word, thinke hollowe and vnequall, 
new and old, filthie, and cleane with inflamation and without 
inflamation, to be differences of vlcers. 
 
Therefore it is necessarie to make distinction, which 
bee the proper differences of Ulcers, and which be complections 
of other affects, but of this a little heereafter. Truelie 
the wonted doctrine of the olde Physitions which I 
[^f.51v^] 
would were now in vse, is altogether natural, for they shew 
the cure of euerie simple effect, but of them all, that doeth 
chieflie Hyppocrates, for the curatiue methode shall best 
proceede, if we shall speake seuerallie of euerie simple by 
themselues, & after shew another method of all compounds, 
as if there were two diseases in the order of diet, retaining 
and flowing, as Thessalus supposeth, when as we had spoken 
of the cure of either of them seuerallie, we must doe in 
like sort of these both ioyned together. So in like sort I suppose, 
because there is one kinde of all vlcers, in that they 
are vlcers, and also one other kinde of inflamations, in that 
they are inflamations, it behooueth to set out the cure of an 
vlcer by it selfe, and the cure of an inflamation by it selfe, & 
after to ioyne both cures together, which thing if we shall 
doe, truelie we shall finde by the methode declared, that euerie 
vlcer ought to be dried and bound, but yet not mundified, 
the hollownesse in the flesh also to bee dryed and mundified, 
but yet not to bee astringed. 
 
Also after the same manner which wee spake of in hollowe 
Ulcers, wee shall for the portion iudge Nature, whether 
it bee softe and loose, or harde and drie, and impact, for 
the first, how much moyster it is, so much lesse need it hath 
of desiccatiues, the last howe much drier it is, so much the 
more it requireth vehement desiccatiues, and medicines 
astringent, the emperike I suppose, will heere make mention 
of children, and women, and delicate bodies, and will 
account young folkes Plowmen and Marriners, of contrarie 
sorte, but seeing that he vnderstandeth not that the medicine 
doth profite children and women, though the moystures 
of their complection and another, agreeth in lyke 
sorte, with Plowmen and Marriners, because of their drie 
temperament, neither can he gesse exactlie the cure of euerie 
bodie, neither yet finde out the cause of errour, whereby 
it dooth come to passe, that he knoweth not how to goe to an 
apter medicine, when that which he first knewe by experience 
doth little profit. 
 
And thus we haue brieflie spoken of glutinatiue medicines, 
and heere followeth another method pertaining to the 
[^f.52r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.25.^] 
preparation and composition of them, for by and by wee applie 
to an hollow vlcer what we list, whether it be a medicine 
drie or moist, for we may strow it in euerie part of the 
vlcer, or else annoint it, but in woundes we cannot so doe, 
where there is a greate deepnesse, for as soone as thou hast 
ioyned the sides of the wound, thou canst not touch the parts 
which are in the bottome diuided. Therfore it is to be considered, 
whether the medicine be moderatly drie and astringent, 
but also whether it may come to the bottome. Cerussa 
and Litharge be moderate drying and astringent, but if thou 
doest strowe it vppon the wound like as ashes, thou shalt 
not profite, for the vertue of the medicine that is sodrie, cannot 
come to the profunditie, therefore there is requyred 
some moistures, or else of some moisture medicine, that it 
may be plaister like, but these belongeth properlie to that 
speculation, which sheweth the composition of medicines, 
and not to that which sheweth the reason of curing. But if 
we shall neede it vnto this matter, we shall touch it in our 
worke heereafter. 
 
[}The fift Chapter.}] 
 
NOw will I turne again to the vlcer which 
requireth to be cicatrised, of which a little 
before we made mention, & the end of these 
also whereto we drawe, is of the like kinde 
y=t= an hollow vlcer is, for it behoueth to regenereate 
somwhat y=t= is lost, and not onely 
to vnite y=t= is diuided, but y=t= which is here to be regenerated, 
is after an other sort than in an hollowe vlcer, seeing y=t= the 
matter there is bloud, but heere it is flesh, for that which is 
hollowe is filled by engendering flesh, whose beginning is 
bloud, and that vlcer is cicatrised that is alreadie filled by 
engendering skinne, which is made of the flesh subiect, and 
surely the flesh which may ingender in an hollowe vlcer, 
may be like to that which is lost, but the skin which shal be 
restored, cannot in all pointes be like y=t= which was before, 
but a thing like the skin, which also may supply y=e= office of y=e= 
[^f.52v^] 
skinne, but yet is not the skinne in deede. And the cause 
trulie wherefore the skinne perished, cannot be againe ingendered, 
like as flesh and fatnesse be, is to be sought out of 
naturall problemes. But we must heere learne both how to 
imitate nature, and also the vse of the skin, and of this thing 
we will now shew the methode, and for that our purpose to 
couer the flesh with some naturall couerture, for that is to 
cicatrise an vlcer, either we must regenerate skin, or make 
the vpper part of the flesh like vnto skinne, but skinne indeede 
cannot be engendered, therefore let vs attempt that 
which may be done. But what waie shall we do this? forsooth 
by alteration for we labour that some part of the flesh 
may no longer be flesh, but maye bee lyke skinne, but by 
what waie sayest thou, shall it be altered? forsooth by the 
helpe of some medicine, whose qualitie will alter, and heere 
against my will in this place, commeth the talke of elements, 
without which, neither can there be founde a medicine 
which can cicatrise, much lesse anie that hath vertue to 
incarnate and glutinate, therefore because the skin is both 
drier and thicker than flesh, if we shall drie and binde the 
flesh, we shall also make it like the skinne. And thus thou 
hast the summe of the medicine which doeth cicatrise, but 
this trulie is not sufficient; for glutinatiues be also dry and 
binding, there if thou doest marke the substaunce of things, 
thou mayst find how these differ from them, but for because 
in the adglutination of vlcers, wee must drie that which 
floweth, so that the sicke part may be free from superfluitie 
in making a cicatrise, we do not onelie consume that which 
floweth, but also the moisture contained in the flesh, truelie 
it is conuenient that the medicine which doth cicatrise, 
bee a great deale drier than that which doeth adglutinate, 
when hee that will adglutinate hath his scope, that he doe 
consume the abundance of the moisture, which is according 
to Nature, he that will cicatrise, doth not take awaie onelie 
this, but also some parte of that which is according to 
Nature. 
 
Therefore vnripe galls and the Pomgranad, rinde of the 
fruit of y=e= Egyptia~ spine, are moderate desiccatiues, Calcites 
[^f.53r^] 
s Victu~, & eris, Squa~ma, & Misi, & Fissum Alumen, be a great 
deale more vehement, and chifely Misi, & Chalcitis, but ris, 
Squamma, is more gentle, and yet s Vstum, much more 
than this, and if thou doest wash it thou shalt haue a medicine 
lesse corrosiue, surely this also belongeth to the speculation 
of compounding medicines, which in order next followeth 
the Methode curatiue, for to know the faculties of 
Medicines. That truely must go before the curatiue Method, 
and we haue hereof intreated in an other place, but 
the composition of medicines must follow, for where vniuersally 
it is commaunded either to drye or make moyst, or 
to make hot, or refrigerate, and that it must be done either 
moderatly, or vehemently, or lightly, we haue vnderstoode 
the facultie of euery simple medicine, it is conuenie~t to co~sider 
this by it selfe, and alone, and also how any may mixe 
them profitably to his vse, and by this meanes there is a 
double knowledge of medicines, one that sheweth their 
vertues, an other of their composition and preparation, but 
wee must retourne to that which yet remaineth of the Methode 
of Ulcers. 
 
[}The sixt Chapter.}] 
 
THere resteth as I suppose to speake of that 
superfluous fleshe, which the most part of 
Phisitions call in Greeke Hyposarcosin, 
surely this sicknesse is of the kinde also of 
those which be in quantitie or magnitude, 
call it as it please you, by either name. Of 
this sort, was hollownesse, of which we haue alreadie entreated. 
Therefore like as that wee call an hollow vlcer, is 
not one affect, but that the hollownesse and vlcer are two, 
so the vlcer that hath supercrescent flesh, is not one disease, 
but the supercrescent flesh and the vlcer be two, the magnitude 
which is against nature, sheweth the first indication, 
which we haue named the waye of finding out remedies, 
that is to say, the taking away of that which aboundeth, & 
this is perfourmed by the onely helpe of medicines, and not 
[^f.53v^] 
by natures diligence, for it is contrarywise that it was in 
engendring flesh, and adglutination, for they be iudged natures 
worke, we onely remouing by medicines applyed, 
those things which doe hinder hir, but the taking away of 
supercrescent fleshe, is no worke of nature, but is done by 
medicines, which doe vehemently dry: surely those medicines 
are next to those which doe vehemently mundifie, and 
also to those that doe ciccatrise, in so much that through errour, 
many take that medicine which taketh away flesh, 
for that which doth mundifie, or for that which doth ciccatrise. 
And that wee go not from our example, if thou doest 
apply to a moist nature Misi & Chalcitis, thou shalt finde y=t= it 
will rather take away flesh than ciccatrise. Wherefore, if 
we in the want of other medicines, be co~pelled to vse these, 
in making a ciccatrise, putting but onely the point of our 
probe in it, being beaten into most exact lightnesse, in after 
applying to the partes which require to be ciccatrised, as it 
were in most fine flower. But if we inte~d to diminish that 
which ouergroweth, then we put it in more largely, truely 
Aerugo, can take away flesh more than these, in so much as 
it passeth y=e= bou~d of ciccatrising medicines, but if thou doest 
burne them, like as they shall be lesse sharpe, so shall they 
be found more apt to make a ciccatrise, but if thou doest also 
wash them, they shall be yet more gentle. Thou reme~brest 
one I thinke, which without reason did cure a filthie vlcer, 
with that notable greene medicine, mixing Honey with it, 
after many dayes past, he finding the vlcer as filthie as before, 
he voyde of knowledge, neither vnderstanding what 
to doe, for it chaunced that the filth was not purged, but 
also some part of the fleshe vnder it, was diminished and 
dissolued, because the medicine was to vehement, (like an 
egregious Phisition) he added more Honney continually 
to the medicine, whereby it might more vehemently mundifie, 
as though the medicine before applyed, had not sufficie~tly 
done it. It came to passe co~trary, for how much y=e= more 
he made his medicine sharp, so much y=e= flesh subiect was co~sumed, 
so that the filth in the Ulcer which sprang of the 
dissolued flesh, the Phisition imputeth it to the medicine, 
[^f.54r^] 
as though it had not wrought, and his ignorance was not 
onelie in the curatiue method, but also in iudging, for if the 
vlcer be found to be in like sorte, most filthie and moist, of 
either medicine, trulie the hollownesse is made greater by 
the vehement dissoluing medicine, as also the vlcer is seene 
to haue swollen lips, and to be redde, and vexed as it were 
with inflamation, and sometime also the patient feeleth manifest 
corrosion by such a medicine, but that medicine that 
doth lesse drie than is requisite, doth neither corrode, neither 
yet doth anie of these things rehearsed. I thinke it therefore 
euident by this, that an Emperike, although hee vseth 
most distinct experience, cannot artificiallie, where thinges 
prosper not, go to that which cureth by a right method, which 
I now doe institute and begin. 
 
[}The seauenth Chapter.}] 
 
FOR the Methode which the methodelesse 
Thessalians doe professe, thou doest know to 
be nothing but the bare name, voide of all effect, 
which seeing there is such and so manifolde 
a method in curing an vlcer, which they 
neither vse the differences of Emperikes in 
finding out remedies, neither as Dogmatists, taking indication 
of the nature of things to be done, but propounding 
that which the common people knowe, they thinke to haue 
declared a certaine method of curing vlcers, that is to saie, 
that an hollow vlcer requireth to be filled with flesh, the vlcer 
filled to be brought to a ciccatrise, that which aboundeth 
with supercrescent flesh, to be taken away, that which is filthie 
to be purged, y=t= which is cleane, to be either adglutinated 
or cicatrised. So farre wide be they, that they knowe 
not how to moist natures medicines, lesse drying are conuenient, 
as vnto drie complections, those which do more exicate. 
Therefore y=t= which hath appeared most manifest in all 
our whole disputation, we must againe repeate, y=t= we may 
be to him most attentiue, & that all other may vnderstand 
how much they haue erred that do corrupt the method of the 
[^f.54v^] 
olde writers, I will begin with that vlcer which requireth 
to be filled with flesh, putting that one for example, because 
of it I haue last made mention, and after this I will speak 
together of the vniuersall curation, therefore I suppose one 
thing to be manifest, not onelie to them which consider by 
reason, but also to them which also follow experience, that 
euerie nature doth not require like medicines, but y=t= those 
that be weaker and more delicate, require more gentle medicines, 
those y=t= are more strong & drier, do in lyke sort require 
more vehement: so trulie standeth the case in those 
where a Cicatrize was to be made, and also in those which 
needeth adglutination, for no delicate bodies forsooth can in 
anie wise suffer a medicine to vehement. 
 
In the like discourse of our talke, it is euident that both 
the nature of the Patient is to be considered, and also that 
there is a proper curation for euerie man, and yet furthermore, 
the third thing, that is to saie, because there is an ineffable 
propertie of euerie nature, neither comprehensible by 
the most exact knowledge, he is the best Phisition of euerie 
perticular patient, which hath gotten the method, wherby 
he may discerne natures, and also coniecture which are 
the proper remedies of euerie one. For it is an extreame 
madnesse, to iudge that there is a common curation of all 
men, as these most foolish Thessalians doe thinke, and for 
that cause they suppose, that all the Theoremes of Phisick 
are ordained, that is, they are such as skilfull men doe and 
performe, a farre knowledge of themselues, and that the art 
is a certaine knowledge of communities, and not properties, 
as though they should cure a vniuersall and not a perticular 
man, therefore lyke as in all other, euen at the beginning 
they erre, so they erre also in this, for the generall 
or common man is not cured, but euerie one of vs hauing 
another complection and nature. But these truelie thinke 
ther is a co~mon cure of al men, I trulie iudge co~trarie, for 
if I knew how to find out exactly euerie priuate nature, I 
would think my self to be such a one, as I conceiue in my 
minde, was Aesculapius. 
 
But forasmuch as that is impossible, surelie I will goe 
[^f.55r^] 
as man maye doe, and I haue decreed to exercise my selfe, 
and doe also exhort others to doe the same, and the emperickes 
as much as they can, to learne those things that are 
common, so to draw neere to those that are proper, but yet 
how much they are wyde from the perfection of the thing, 
it is before spoken. For these notes for children or women, 
or olde folkes, or those that haue soft fleshe, and white, and 
such lyke, are not to be put as they think, for sure differences, 
but rather how the bodie is affected, in moystures and 
drynesse, and it is conuenient as much as may, to allow the 
Emperick Phisitions both for many other things, and also 
for that they go as neere as they can, to the propertie of 
the sicke. For after all their other separations, which they 
make, they adde also that which is taken of custome, as 
though hereby they shall finde remedies, which are more 
proper for the pacient. But we will speake hereafter more 
largely of custome, when we shall proue the difference of 
custome, inuented by the olde writers, for the knowledge 
of the propertie of the pacients nature.
