[}A FEW 
QUERIES 
Relating to the 
Practice of Physick, 
WITH 
Remarks upon some of them. 
Modestly proposed to the serious 
Consideration of Mankind, &c.}] 
 
Q 1. WHether every Sickness 
and indisposition in 
humane Bodies, as 
well Acute as Chronical, doth not arise 
from the change of useful, nutrimental, 
[^p.2^] 
and natural humours into vitious; and 
whether such change is not chiefly, if not 
only caused by an Error of some of the 
six Non-naturals in the sick Patient; or, 
if Hereditary, in their Parents? 
 
The Author is inclin'd to believe, 
that all Diseases proceed only from 
the alteration of Good Humours into 
Bad; for all Persons may enjoy perfect 
Health, if some change within 
them did not hinder. Nor doth it 
appear to this Author, that any other 
entrance for Diseases hath been anciently 
or lately discovered, besides 
the said six Non-naturals, which are 
agreed to be as Follows, 1. Air, 
2. Meat and Drink, 3. Motion and 
Rest, 4. Sleep and Watching, 5. Excretion 
and Retention, 6. and lastly, 
the Passions of the Mind. Under some 
of which, as Excretion and Retention, 
may be justly comprehended, 
Stinging, Bruising, Wounding, &c. 
 
[^p.3^] 
2. Whether Sickness, or that preternatural 
Something, thus introduced, 
can ever be removed, till such vitiated 
Humours shall be either changed again 
into good, or expell'd the Body? 
 
If there is a third way to free Patients 
from Diseases, besides Evacuation 
and Alteratives; such as know 
it, will do well to oblige the World 
with it. 
 
3. Whether these bad Humours can 
be any more altered and reduced to their 
primitive Excellence and Order, than 
Curds and Whey can be reduced again to 
good sweet Milk? 
 
If this be impossible, as the Author 
is apt to believe it is; then 'twill be 
in vain to hope for the recovery of 
Health by Alteratives: For, though 
the Body and Blood can be alter'd by 
superinducing natural Juices, as the 
bad wasts, yet the bad parts of the 
Blood, or the ill Humors mixt with 
it, can never be changed to any good 
[^p.4^] 
purpose. And that which probably 
deludes some into a contrary Opinion, 
is, that when Health is restored by insensible 
Perspiration or Evacuation by 
Urine, &c. without any more manifest 
discharge by Siege Sweat or Vomiting: 
Tis presumed though it be no 
natural consequence that the same 
individual bad Humours are totally 
changed into Good, for life being 
a continual Flux, daily wasting and 
requiring daily supply, 'tis not to be 
doubted, but, as the bad are consumed, 
Nature is daily furnished with a 
better Juice from wholesome Food; 
so that the bad decaying (which is 
a sort of Evacuation) faster than 
they are again recruited, Health returns 
of course after all the vitious 
Humours have been so consumed. 
But there hath been farther objected 
against this Opinion, that Pleurisies 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ave been sometimes cured by Alteratives 
only, without Bleeding or other 
[^p.5^] 
manifest Evacuation; and that 
prickt and decay'd Wines have been 
also recovered from their Acidity, 
&c. by Alteratives: In answ_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] to 
which may be offer'd to second Consideration, 
that Non causa pro causa 
hath made many, if not most of the 
mistakes in the World, and this probably 
amongst the rest: For 'tis not 
unlikely, but that such Pleurisies were 
cured, either by Evacuation, though 
less manifest, as by Urine or insensible 
Perspiration; or else by precipitation 
or depositing the peccant matter 
on a less noble part, separating 
thereby the Humours from their Impurities: 
For, if the whole Mass of 
Blood had been corrupted, it had 
been impossible to mend it, and the 
Patient must have died; because in 
this acute Disease Non dantur induciæ. 
And, when there is only a Separation 
from the Blood of the corrupted Humours 
mixt with it, without any expulsion, 
[^p.6^] 
it can be but a truce, or shifting 
off the present inconvenience, and no 
cure; a kind of purging the Blood, 
but not the whole Body, which still 
remains affected, though possibly not 
after the same manner. 
 
As to the Wines 'tis certain, that 
the greatest part of them was no otherwise 
Acid, than Water made so 
with a few drops of Spirit of Vitriol, 
which are sometimes cured by an Alkali, 
or by the heavy parts setling by 
their own weight to the Bottom, as 
new River-water is purified when 
Muddy; and sometimes by the help 
of a Ferment as in compound Liquors, 
where the lighter parts flying 
upward, becoome a Cap or Head, as 
they call it, on the top to preserve the 
Liquor, and the heavier parts are 
precipitated to the Bottom, leaving 
the Wine pure and sound in the Middle; 
but this change is no other, but 
a Separation of the Acid or Noxious 
[^p.7^] 
parts from the rest of the Wine, 
which (the Cask still retaining all 
the hurtful parts wihin it, as before, 
though not in the same manner and 
mixture) will upon every the least 
disturbance be again out of Order. 
 
4. Whether 'tis possible Health can be 
restored by any other means than Evacuation 
only, either by a natural Crisis, 
or by Art? 
 
Such as grant the Premises can never 
dispute this Point; but the following 
instance, amongst many others, 
that might have been quoted, 
may end the Controversie, viz. Patients 
recovering out of the Small 
Pox, where no Art was made use of, 
might have been saved only by a critital 
Expulsion of all the peccant matter 
through the strength of Nature. 
And, whenever that matter recoils, 
or is struck back, and not afterwards 
sufficiently expell'd by Nature, the 
Patient must die, if Art doth not assist 
[^p.8^] 
to drive it out by Sweat or otherwise. 
 
5. Whether when Poison is received 
into the Body, there are not very few, if 
any, that dreams of curing such a Patient 
by only Alteratives? And whether 
they do not rather unanimously agree to 
expel it by all the skilful ways, and 
with all the speed possible? 
 
If this be daily practice, as the Author 
doubts not, the same reason may 
hold for Diseases, which are as truly 
Poisons bred in the Body, as the other 
that is taken inwardly, and every 
way as Dangerous: And as there 
are degrees of Poison, so there are of 
Diseases, some more some less injurious 
or mortal; but, still all must be 
expell'd sooner or later, the Weaker 
as well as the Stronger. 
 
6. Whether in a strict sense there is 
any such thing as Poison? 
 
Some say Van Helmont was of Opinion 
there was not, and the Author 
sees no cause to differ from him; for, 
[^p.9^] 
God made all things good and useful 
to Mankind, but our folly, and 
ignorance of the right use and just 
Dose of many things, makes their excess 
Dangerous and sometimes Mortal: 
Even Roast-beef, Brandy and 
Opium in too large Doses surfeit and 
kill, when Arsenick and Precipitate, 
if justly dosed or under dosed, do 
no hurt, but many times much good. 
Now that hath only been esteem'd 
Poison, which can kill in small quantities, 
and not that which can only 
kill in great, though they were equally 
injurious to the Persons kill'd by 
them; nor is there any great difference 
betwixt Poison bred in or received 
into the Body, when equally 
hurtful, both being preternatural, 
and to be expell'd, before the Patient 
can be safe. 
 
7. Whether it is not absolutely necessary 
for a Physician to be able to determine 
skillfully, with respect to Patients, 
[^p.10^] 
Disease, Age, Strength and Sex, 
what Evacuation is most suitable as to 
Manner, Season, Quantity, and Number? 
 
Hipocrates say, Quo natura tendit 
tinde, dum Natura movet move, and 
if Evacuation only cures, 'tis fit it 
should be well understood. 
 
8. Whether a Physician who treats 
his Patient with as much Art and Diligence 
as any other could, omitting nothing 
requisite, nor directing any thing 
hurtful or unnecessary, may justly be 
blamed, should such a Patient miscarry 
by some unexpected dangerous accident, 
lurking in secret beyond any Mans discovery? 
 
Whenever the like happens, the 
Physician ought not to be blamed, 
because it was not his Fault but his 
Misfortune, and not within the power 
of any known Art to be prevented; 
for, no Man blames a skillful and industrious 
Husbandman, because (after 
[^p.11^] 
he hath cultivated his Land 
with all the Care and Art imaginable) 
his Hopes are blasted, 
and his Crop destroyed by an 
unexpected ill Season. Hence 
may be observed, that good or 
ill success alone is not sufficient 
to guide our Judgments, but 
that we must suspend our Centures 
till well instructed in every 
minute circumstance; for 
the interposition of sundry Accidents, 
not always to be foreseen, 
may much alter the Case; 
nor must a Physician by such accidents 
be frightned into too strict 
caution, which may be as prejudicial 
as too forward Rashness. 
He that regardeth the Wind, 
saith Solomon, shall never Sow; 
and though all that may happen, 
deserves mature consideration; 
[^p.12^] 
yet if that should hinder Action, 
Physicians must resolve to sit still, 
or do no good. General success 
in like difficult cases, may direct 
our judgment, though 'tis not 
advisable to be too forward to 
censure the success of Physicians 
or their Methods, without being 
very well acquainted with both, 
least it prove not only injurious 
to them, but very prejudicial to 
such as might have received benefit 
from them, had it not been 
for such Scandalous, Foolish, or 
false Reports, which may sometimes 
unintended injure the reporters 
Friends as well as others. 
No Physician is to be blamed 
when his Patient dies, unless his 
own greater care, or anothers better 
skill could have prevented it. 
 
[^p.13^] 
9. Whether any Patient who is 
likely to live without purging can be 
too weak to be relieved by Evacuation? 
Since, ad before proved, no relief 
can be reasonably expected without 
it: And whether the sooner 'tis 
submitted to, it is not the better? 
 
If they are able to live without 
artificial Relief, and removing 
their Disease, they will certainly 
be much more so, if part of, or 
all their Disease shall be removed; 
obsta principijs, sero medicina 
paratur, is a known rule and very 
fit to be followed. 
 
10. Whether Patients, too weak 
to be relieved by proper Evacuation, 
can be strong enough to recover 
Health without it? 
 
It is not likely, because that 
Disease which hath reduced them 
from full strength to so low a 
[^p.14^] 
degree of weakness, must certainly 
if it continues, increase the 
weakness, if not destroy the Patient; 
but, if Purging carries off 
most part of the Disease, which 
weakens the Patient, Nature 
hath the less to contend with, 
and consequently may master the 
remainder, and recover strength: 
Therefore a Patient's weakness 
can be no sufficient argument against 
Evacuation, unless the Disease 
be already quite expelled by 
Nature, and then there may be 
no need of it. For a thinking 
Soldier will hardly ever judge his 
condition the worse for having 
the numbers of his Enemies lessened, 
let the success be good or 
bad. 
 
11. Whether the most powerful 
and effectual Evacuations, by some 
[^p.15^] 
called violent, are not when discreetly 
used, the most proper for the 
weakest Patients, and to be persisted 
in with the smallest Intervals of rest. 
 
Certainly they are, and to be 
continued, if weak Patients have 
little or no time to triflle away. 
The Fatal consequences of timorous 
and needless delays ought by 
all meanes to be prevented, and 
Diseases not suffer'd to increase 
again by long respits, as they, as 
certainly do, as Hair and Nails 
grow after cutting. If indeed 
strong Patients squander away 
some time, they have still enough 
left with strength to recover such 
loss; though such hazards are 
never commendable; for seeming 
weak Diseases have by delays 
at length kill'd the strongest Patients, 
and where Life and Health 
[^p.16^] 
are concern'd, nothing ought to 
be put to an Adventure. The 
Doses are to be proportioned to 
the weakness of Patients, but the 
Indication is still the same: For 
Example, if nothing besides a 
Vomit can cure some Diseases, 
the Vomit must be taken in a 
smaller Dose, than robust Patients 
do, or the Sick Person must 
die. 
 
12. Whether the loss of Strength, 
occasioned by Diseases, can be ever 
restored whilst the Disease continues 
in the same Vigour? And whether 
weakness proceeding from the Operations 
of Evacuating Remedies, doth 
not usually cease soon after the Operation 
is over? 
 
Effects alwaies wait upon their 
Causes, ablata causa tollitur effectus, 
and where no impediment 
[^p.17^] 
hinders, Nature soon recovers 
Strength. 
 
13. Whether simple weakness being 
only an impotency or incapacity 
of Nature to perform the necessary 
duties of Body and Mind, and alwaies 
free from any sort of Sickness, 
Fever, or Pains, else it must be 
more than simple weakness, may not 
be removed by good Diet only? 
 
Probably it may. 
 
14. Whether a weak Patient 
may not as well hope to recover his 
perfect Health without Evacuation, 
as that he shall grow stronger 
under his Disease without it? 
 
Neither is very probable, and 
therefore tis imprudent to venture 
it. That some recover without 
Art, 'tis certain, but very 
many do die for want of it, who 
might very well have been saved 
[^p.18^] 
by it, if they had timely applied 
themselves to Artists. 
 
15. Whether the benefit a Patient 
afterwards receives by expelling 
with aritificial Evacuation the morbifique 
matter, doth not abundantly 
compensate his present loss of 
Strength and Spirits? 
 
This is daily confirmed in Patients, 
that, though they are 
weakned for the present by every 
sort of artificial Evacuation, 
soon after find sensible relief and 
great ease. Ex conferentibus & 
lædentibus sumuntur indicationes. 
 
16. Whether Patients are not 
more strengthened by a purge which 
expells the Disease which weakens, 
than by Cordials which do not. 
 
That which removes the weakness 
is more likely to strengthen 
than that which cannot. Impura 
[^p.19^] 
Corpora quo magis nutrieris eo 
magis læseris. The most which 
can be expected from Cordials, 
which do not empty by Sweat 
or Urine, is a speedier supply of 
Spirits to encounter the Disease: 
though too many of them, as 
well as of nourishing Diet, may 
sooner surfeit and destroy than 
comfort: And 'tis certainly much 
better to save the Spirits that labour 
and remove the Distemper 
by Evacuation; for fewer Spirits 
can better vanquish a Disease almost 
master'd, than greater plenty 
can a Disease too mighty for 
them. Nor is there any Reason, 
why Purges and other Evacuations 
should be so terrible, for 
they are but a kind of ferment 
given to awaken Nature to cooperate. 
Where violent Exercise 
[^p.20^] 
Weakens, rest and moderate refreshment 
Strengthens; but where 
Diseases weaken nothing but 
their total removal can give Nature 
afterwards an opportunity 
to be strengthned by a good Diet, 
which can signifie little or 
nothing before. 
 
17. Whether the inactivity, 
want or dissipation of Spirits, which 
renders Men dull, weak and faint, 
doth not proceed either from the 
Spirits being clog'd with preternatural 
humours for want of due exercise, 
or from and unusual expense 
of Natural Humours and Animal 
Spirits; either exhaled by unseasonable 
Hot-weather, or consumed by 
tedious labour or violent exercise, or 
lastly wasted by large preternatural, 
or imprudent Artificial Evacuations? 
 
[^p.21^] 
All Weakness or Faintness 
without question comes by the 
want or oppression of Spirits, 
which cannot alwaies without 
help extricate or exert themselves 
when fettered or suffocated with 
ill humours; nor can they continue, 
if not daily supplied and 
increased by good Humours, 
which often corrupt for want of 
suitable Exercise, therefore a Patient 
must necessarily be faint 
without new supplies, when his 
Spirits have been wasted by any 
of the forementioned ways. 
 
18. Whether any Patient can 
be either too old or to young, any 
more than too weak or too strong 
to use Evacuations, whenever there 
is occasion for them? 
 
Surely none can, for if Patients 
too old or young may be 
[^p.22^] 
cured without Evacuating Medicines, 
Persons in their prime 
may also be so cured, and then 
away with the Profession; but if 
they cannot, 'tis not a tenderness 
but a cruelty to refuse them; 
besides they can but die with Evacuation, 
and may live, having 
a chance for it; when without 
it in all probability they must die. 
Præstat anceps remedium quam nullum; 
extremis morbis extrema remedia 
conveniunt. 
 
19. Whether the speediest way to 
restore strength and flesh to Patients 
exhausted and emaciated by long 
Sickness, is not to forbid them 
strong nourishing Food, and order 
them a spare plain Diet, to use exercise 
and to be cheerful. 
 
If this proves the best Method, 
then certainly the common practice 
[^p.23^] 
of the kind Ladies and 
Nurse-keepers, to stuff the Sick 
with strong Broths, and good 
Jellies, must needs be destructive. 
It is for the most part good things 
only hurt; because they being 
agreeable and very nourishing, 
soon surfeit before one is aware. 
 
20. Whether, if no Specifick, 
Cordial, or Alterative Medicine can 
relieve sick Patients, and expell their 
Diseases so well as Vomits, Purges, 
or other Evacuations, any Person 
may be too weak to take them; and 
whether 'tis fit any Patient, though 
never so strong, should be treated 
with them, if they can only weaken 
and disorder and can do no more, or 
not so much as the other Remedies? 
 
If in this last part 'tis true that 
Vomits, &c. can do no good but 
trouble and offend a Patient, 
[^p.24^] 
then all Physicians are highly 
to blame, that have ever prescribed 
Evacuations; but, there are 
Millions of instances to prove, 
that Evacuations discreetly order'd 
have not only done no 
wrong, but abundance more 
good, than all other Remedies; 
for there cannot be one Example 
given, from the beginning of the 
World to this day, of any one 
Patient, that ever recovered without 
some sort of Evacuation Natural 
or Artificial, the contrary 
being a contradiction in Nature 
not to be supposed. 
 
21. Whether Vomits, or any other 
evacuating Remedies have often, 
if ever, caused or hastned the 
Death of any Patient; or rather 
whether 'tis not always, or at least 
for the most part Diseases, which, 
[^p.25^] 
for want of Vomits, &c. soon enough 
or oft enough repeated, destroy 
Mankind? 
 
That thousands of Vomits, and 
other Evacuations have been given 
in all Cases, to all Ages and 
Sexes, not only without hurt, but 
also with much benefit, is as 
clear as the Sun, and also that Diseases 
daily kill without the help 
of Medicine. Such therefore, as 
maintain the contrary, will do 
well to shew which way Vomits 
or other Evacuations kill, but, 
unless he can prove that he hath 
kill'd as many by Vomits and 
Purges, as others can prove, they 
have saved by them, he will do 
well to spare his labour. Note 
also that there can be no more 
danger, nor greater sickness in 
vomiting with a Vomit, than 
[^p.26^] 
without one; which few Women 
with Child, and very sick 
Persons can avoid or are the 
worse for. 
 
22. Whether 'tis not very true, 
that most die without taking Vomits, 
tho some may die that have 
taken them? 
 
This few, if any will deny. 
 
23. Whether any dies with a Vomit, 
who could probably have lived 
longer without it? 
 
This some may believe, but 
'twill be a great service to Mankind 
if they can well prove it. 
 
24. Whether very many have not 
died for want of Vomits, who had 
most certainly remained alive, if 
they had taken them? 
 
This can never be proved, but 
may be strongly presumed, 
 
25. Whether 'tis not the cause or 
morbisick matter still remaining behind, 
[^p.27^] 
which is dangerous, protracts 
the Disease, or hastens the death of 
the Patient, and neither natural 
nor artifical Vomiting, Loosness, 
nor other Flux, nor Boils, Pimples, 
nor other Eruptions whatsoever? 
 
Few suffer by what breaks 
forth or is Evacuated, but by 
that which remains behind. 
 
26. Whether, if Vomits must 
be given, when there are indications 
for them, and _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]o considerable contraindications, 
they ought not also 
to be repeated, whilst the indication 
so circumstantiated continues, supporting 
Nature in the intervals by 
true Cordials and good Nourishment? 
 
The same reason which directs 
a Vomit at first, directs repetitions 
whilst it continues with reasonable 
intervals, if nothing new 
appears to prohibit it. 
 
[^p.28^] 
27. Whether (though Vomits are 
so very uneasie in their Operation 
as to make Patients to apprehend 
them very dangerous) there is 
really any more danger in taking 
them, than in taking a Caudle or a 
Cordial? 
 
There is oft-times greater danger 
in forbearing, than in taking 
Vomits, because the Disease may 
kill, which they may possibly overcome; 
but to answer directly, 
the usual Vomits unless over Dosed, 
(which is no more than where 
any other Medicine is so, and 
therefore not to be supposed to be 
given by any Physician, though 
of small Experience,) are not dangerous, 
for neither the material 
they are made of is inimical to 
Nature, nor the action of Vomiting 
dangerous; for what must 
[^p.29^] 
then become of most Sick Persons, 
Women with Child and 
even New-born Babes, who are 
all generally inclin'd to and frequently 
do Vomit? Indeed Vomits 
are so safe, and generally so 
effectual, that many pretenders 
to Physick, cherish these terrible 
apprehensions of them in their 
Patients to discourage them from 
their use, that so they may keep 
them the longer in hand, before 
they will be cured. 
 
28. Whether Purging, Vomiting, 
or other Evacuations, usually 
called Violent, can be ever so dangerous 
and uneasie, as Diseases are 
first and last, or as ineffectual gentle 
Medicines and Methods are? 
 
That is, no Physick, judiciously 
given, van be so dangerous 
as the Disease, which gentle and 
[^p.30^] 
ineffectual Remedies can never 
lessen nor vanquish; and that 
which makes them esteemed violent 
is the Uneasiness, Sickness, 
and Gripings in their Operation, 
which is effected by only moving 
the vitious humours, cause of the 
Sickness, and therefore ought to 
be courted and not avoided, since 
Health cannot be purchased at a 
cheaper Rate, or without more 
uncertainty and longer time. 
 
29. Whether too long intervals 
of time, betwixt the repeating Evacuations, 
loseth not many lives? 
 
Most likely; for the Disease 
recovers in those spaces as much 
or more strength and vigour, 
than it lost by the preceeding 
Evacuations; but, if indeed Diseases 
could have their Progress 
stopt the while, there might be 
[^p.31^] 
some pretence for a delay till the 
Patient recovered strength; but 
they having once gotten an existence, 
do daily draw to themselves 
Humours for their support. Thus 
we plainly see Corns and Warts 
to continue and increase many 
years, and so do several other 
Diseases for their time, though 
not so apparently. 
 
30. Whether the Stomach is 
not originally, or by Sympathy with 
some other part of the Body affected 
in most Distempers? And whether 
therefore all cures ought not to be begun 
there? 
 
Whilst the offending matter is 
in the Stomach, and primæ viæ, 'tis 
much the better and shorter way 
to expell it by Vomits or Purges, 
than to drive it through all the 
Meanders of the Body out by the 
[^p.32^] 
Pores. Indeed, where it hath 
left the primæ vivæ wholly, and 
is entred or past the Blood, the 
safest way may be to protrude it 
by sweat; though as long as 
there are any remains in the 
Stomach, notwithstanding part 
is already past beyond, Vomits 
and Purges are most proper and 
beneficial, and ought to precede 
Bleeding and Sweating, because, 
if the first region is not well cleansed 
the other must continue foul; 
as no Cistern can run clear which 
comes from a muddy Spring, nor 
can you clean an inner Room 
without fouling again the outward 
Room, having imprudently 
cleaned the outward first; for 
every part of the Body derives 
its Nourishment originally from 
the Stomach, and an Errour committed 
[^p.33^] 
there can never after be 
corrected in any other part; but 
by sending forth those peccant 
Humours by the Pores, though 
their gross parts can never pass 
them easily, but may lodge by 
the way amongs the small Vessels 
and cause Obstructions. 
 
31. Whether, if Patients refuse 
to continue under cure, and 
to pursue Directions till the Disease 
shall be subdued, it is not probable 
it will return again? 
 
If so, then Remedies are not 
to be neglected, till Diseases 
shall be rooted out, and perfect 
Health restored; for it seems as 
natural for Diseases to recruit 
their force, if you refrain Purging 
before they are cured, as 'tis 
for a Boat to drive down the 
Stream to the place you entered 
[^p.34^] 
into it, when you cease to row 
against it without fastning the 
Boat. 
 
32. Whether a Fever (being only 
a greater heat than ordinary unnaturally 
kindled in the blood by the 
admission of bad humours) ought 
not rather to be assisted in driving 
forth such humours, than to be 
checkt by the Jesuit's Pouder or the 
like? 
 
Most certainly, if the Fever or 
Ague Fit is not the Disease nor 
cause of it, as there is great reason 
to believe, but a strife only 
betwixt the expulsive Faculty and 
the vitious Humours, in order to 
Expell them by Sweat, which is 
often perform'd by Nature only. 
And, if this were not true, 'tis 
probable Patients could never recover 
out of Fevers by the 
[^p.35^] 
strength of Nature without Art. 
Now, if all or part of those preternatural 
Juices had been carried 
off by Stool or Vomit, whilst 
they continued in the primæ viæ, 
the Fever had either been quite 
overcome, or in a great measure 
so moderated, that there would 
have been the less work for Nature. 
The Jesuit's Pouder seem indeed 
to cure an Ague, but oft-times 
it leaves the Patient in as bad, or 
a worse condition of Health than 
before. 
 
33. Whether 'tis not possible for 
the present to extinguish, quiet or 
qualifie the heat of many Fevers long 
before the Patient recover his perfect 
Health, or even wihthout contributing 
the least towards it; and 
whether there doth not then remain 
matter in the Body like embers raked 
[^p.36^] 
together, ready for a relapse or 
the production of seeming new distempers 
afterwards? 
 
Most Fevers are without doubt 
daily so quieted by the Jesuits 
Pouder, leaving the Patient many 
times in a worse condition 
without the Fever, than before 
with it. And the new Diseases 
which after appear, are believed 
but by few to be the effect of 
the preceeding ill cured Fever, 
tho a little patience and care to 
observe may convince them, that 
there is scarce an Ague cured by 
the Jesuits Pouder, without previous 
or subsequent Evacuation, 
but is soon followed by a return 
of the same, or by a seeming new 
Distemper; especially Chronical, 
which had its Original only from 
the foregoing Ague. 
 
[^p.37^] 
34. Whether 'tis not possible with 
God's blessing to prevent the Raging, 
Spreading and Progress of 
the Plague, and to save many thousands, 
who in all probability must 
have else died in a Plague Year? 
 
If it were not possible, such 
Magistrates as have made reasonable 
provision against it, and such 
Physicians, who have by their 
advice incouraged the Magistrates 
to do so, have been very ill employed; 
but the possibility may 
be demonstrated almost to a certainty. 
 
35. Whether 'tis not as much 
the Magistrates Duty as their Prudence 
to provide against the Plague 
as well as against an Enemy upon 
an approaching War? 
 
Both the Plague and Sword 
are esteemed God's Judgments, 
[^p.38^] 
and if it were not lawfull to provide 
against the Plague, because 
'tis a Judgment; for the same 
reason we ought to make no provision 
against an Enemy; but the 
last is allowed by most part of 
Mankind, and the same reason 
justifies the former. 
 
36. Whether the many Persons 
murthered in Plague Years by 
Nurses, or dying for want of Care, 
Skill, Food, or Assistance, could 
not have been saved alive by a suitable 
Provision? 
 
The Truth of this will not be 
denied; and though all infected 
with the Plague were under a necessity 
of dying as they are not, 
yet if the above-mentioned might 
with care be saved, they well 
deserve it. 
 
[^p.39^] 
37. Whether most infected with 
the Plague, receive it not from others? 
 
If this is granted, then a seasonable 
and timely separating the 
whole from the sick might save 
them from such infection; so 
that though all infected were incurable, 
all the whole by a prudent 
and skillful foresight may 
probably escape the infection and 
live. 
 
38. Whether most of the Cities, 
infected in these Northern Countries, 
have not the Plague brought 
to them by infected Persons or Goods 
from Abroad, instead of receiving 
it from a pestilential Air, as many 
Believe? 
 
If it were not communicated by 
contact, how came it to pass, 
that in the last great Plague in 
[^p.40^] 
England, there were fourty 
Towns infected by Persons or 
Goods, known to be brought 
from London, for any one that 
had neither; and if it proceeded 
from the Air, 'twas wonderful 
how Mortclack could be so much 
Infected, and Richmond and Barnes, 
but a mile on each side from it, 
but very little; besides Rains and 
variable Winds, do always cleanse 
and change the Air? 
 
39. Whether any Disease could 
last long, if not daily supplied from 
the Body, as Hair and Nails are? 
 
There is little reason to think 
it would: But Diseases once existing 
have a vegetative life like 
Plants, and will according to 
their respective Kinds and Duration, 
unless interrupted by Art or 
Nature, support themselves by 
[^p.41^] 
attracting Nourishment out of 
the Body; and this was apparent 
in a Patient the Author had many 
years ago, and recovered, after 
she had been wasted by a looseness 
of Three Years standing, in 
which time she must have discharged 
by Stool, at but half a 
pound a day, above 547 pound, 
which was near five times her own 
weight; if therefore it had not 
been supplied, it must either have 
ended the Patient or it self in 
few Months. 
 
40. Whether all such cures must 
not fail that are not as justly proportioned 
to the Disease, as to the 
strength of the Patient? 
 
Few will doubt but they must; 
for, suppose an ounce of peccant 
matter to be daily prepared, and 
no more emptyed either by Nature 
[^p.42^] 
or the Remedy, the Disease 
must necessarily remain in the 
same state; but if less be emptied, 
the Disease must increase; if 
more, it must mathematically 
have an End. What is further 
to be considered, is, how to avoid 
making too much hast for the 
Patient's strength, with violent 
Remedies so called, or large Doses; 
or too little to save his life; 
for when Diseases ride post, Remedies 
must not follow a snails 
pace, curable Diseases must be 
headed and out-run according to 
their pace. Extremis morbis extrema 
remedia conveniunt. 
 
41. Whether (when vitious humours 
received, bred, or alther'd within 
the Body, happen to be put into 
motion, either by their quantity, 
quality, or other accident) the expulsive 
[^p.43^] 
faculty is not thereby excited, 
without ceasing or by fits, to drive 
them from one part to another, till 
they shall be either quite expell'd, or 
the remainder thrown upon some outward 
or ignoble part, where it becomes 
a setled Pain, Tumour, Ulcer, Fistula 
or the like, unless Death ends 
the strife before. 
 
It is evident how small a matter 
is uneasie to Nature, a Moat 
in the Eye and a small Fibre between 
the Teeth gives great disturbance, 
even our natural Humours 
out of their proper Vessels, 
as extravasated Blood, as well as 
the preternatural Humours, puts 
Nature upon an endeavour to 
free it self, from what can be no 
longer useful to it, and thus are 
both Acute and Chronical Distempers 
formed, and that which 
[^p.44^] 
continues their periods, is either 
the Weakness or Situation of the 
part, or a preternatural Ferment 
lodged in it, which is a prepared 
matter like tinder ready to catch 
Fire, assoon as any Foregn spark 
falls on it. 
 
42. Whether, before a Patient 
recovers, many ill fits do not return 
in the course of a Disease; and 
whether, before a patient dies, he 
hath not many lucid Intervals? 
 
This is so known to practitioners 
that it must not be denyed, therefore 
the first ought not to minister 
fear or despair if other circumstances 
are good; nor the last to 
give hopes when they are not. 
 
43. Whether Health is not preserved 
by the several fluids or humours 
of the Body in a natural or 
healthy State; and Sickness introduced 
[^p.45^] 
by like fluids in a preternatural 
or unhealthy State? 
 
This seems to be self-evident. 
 
44. Whether the Spirits, or finer 
parts of those Natural Fluids, are 
not active for our preservation; and 
the Spirits or finer parts of the preternatural 
Fluids as active for our 
Destruction? 
 
This appears no less manifest 
than the last. 
 
45. Whether the natural Fluids 
are not preserved and supplied by a 
right use of the Six Nonnaturals; 
and the preternatural introduced by 
a wrong use or abuse of the same 
Non-naturals? 
 
This few will deny. 
 
46. Whether the proportion of 
strength and quantity of good animal 
Spirits is not according to the 
quantity of the natural Humours; 
[^p.46^] 
and whether the quantity of evil 
Spirits and their activity and contrarity 
to our Natures is not proportionable 
to the quantity of preternatural 
humours? 
 
If this be granted, as it cannot 
well be denied, then must 
the Duration, Power, and Danger 
of Diseases with their extent 
to part or all the body bear exact 
proportion with the quantity 
of such preternatural Humours. 
 
47. Whether as long as there is 
life, there is not hopes, and whether 
any Remedy is not better than 
none? 
 
Dum spiro spero, præstat anceps 
remedium quam nullum. For Patients 
have been reduced to that 
desperate Condition in the Opinion 
of By-standers, as no appearance 
of life remained, and yet 
[^p.47^] 
by God's blessing directing to the 
right means, they have beyond 
hopes recovered, so that none 
ought to be forsaken before they 
are dead; besides, what hurt can 
there be to try to save a Patient 
tho the greatness or progress of 
the Disease should give little Encouragement; 
they can but die? 
Tentare non nocet. Many who in 
all appearance were past Hopes, 
are now alive and well, and must 
certainly have died, had not proper 
means been used in Season. 
 
48. Whether a frequant unreasonable 
fancy, if not very accidental 
and occasional, is not as much a 
Disease requiring help, as a Fever or 
the Scurvy? 
 
The Arch-bishop of York in his 
Sermon of the Government of the 
Thoughts, fully grants this quere 
[^p.48^] 
saying, That he doubts not but extravagant 
Fancies are as properly 
a bodily Disease, as a Fever or Fits 
of the Falling Sickness. Madness 
is only extravagant Fancies, and 
the Spleen but some degrees below 
it; if therefore the Spleen 
and Madness can be cured, why 
not Fancies, which, though a Disease, 
is much less. 
 
49. Whether Persons in perfect 
Health ought ever to take Physick, 
or Purge; and whether the Unhealthy 
ought to neglect it one Moment? 
 
Health ad pondus is not to be 
expected on Earth, but Health 
ad justitiam may, and such are to 
take no Purging Physick, except 
in a visible Plethora; because it 
will certainly carry off some Humours 
which ought not, and protempore 
[^p.49^] 
weaken the Patient by 
wasting without any necessity or 
benefit so many of his Spirits, 
there being no ill Humours to be 
workt upon which might have 
recompensed that loss and trouble; 
but on the other side, a sick 
Patient ought to lose no time in 
hopes of being well to Morrow, 
which deceived many out of the_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
lives; for the sooner they begin, 
the sooner they'll be cured, and 
the less serves turn, and they recover 
with much greater speed 
and certainty, and less charge 
than if they delay till they become 
weak and the Disease 
strong. 
 
50. Whether 'tis not sufficient 
that Medicaments are beneficial, 
without expecting they should be 
either easie in Operation or pleasant 
in Tast? 
 
[^p.50^] 
For Medicaments were made 
for necessity only and not delight, 
though Food was made for 
both; because we cannot live 
without Food: But, if Mankind 
was wise enough to follow in 
these matters the dictates of 
Nature, there would be little need 
of Physick; so that 'tis God's 
Mercy we can have our Healths 
upon any Terms, and the worse 
the better for a punishment to 
make us wise and wary to preserve 
our Healths by Moderation 
and a Regular Life. 
 
51. Whether 'tis not as vain to 
expect to be freed from Diseases without 
Pain or Sorrow, as for a Woman 
to expect to be delivered of her 
Children without Pain? 
 
Whatever satisfaction there 
may be in their Causes, the Proverb 
[^p.51^] 
tells us, Sweet Meet must 
have sowre Sauce; so that which 
is sweet in the Mouth may be 
bitter in the Belly, and for want 
of true Wisdom (which is a faculty 
of discerning remote consequences 
beyond the deceitful 
appearance of things) most 
People are ensnared to their ruin; 
for Evils have Beautiful out-sides 
but rotten insides; when Good 
hath comfort in the end, though 
not outwardly so charming adorned. 
 
52. Whether 'tis not very prudent, 
to study to preserve our 
Healths, to recover it the shortest 
and safest way when lost, and to submit 
(before 'tis too late) to stronger 
means, when gentle are insufficient? 
 
[^p.52^] 
If Health is the most precious 
Jewel next the Soul, the wise, 
that know it, will both study to 
preserve and recover it, and always 
use the means though seemingly 
violent by which they may 
attain their end with greatest certainty. 
 
53. Whether violent Medicines 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ught to be neglected or their use 
delayed where gentle will prove ineffectual 
and endanger a Patient? 
 
If gentle Medicines are equally 
profitable, 'tis imprudent to 
use the violent; but, where they 
are not, 'tis as imprudent to neglect 
them; extremis morbis extrema 
remedia conveniunt. But 
much of this doubt would be 
solved; if the word (Violent) 
were well understood; some mean 
dangerous by it, and then such 
[^p.53^] 
Medicines deserve alwaies to be 
rejected; others powerful and effectual, 
and then they they ought never 
to be out of use; for 'tis alwaies 
better to make use of violent 
Medicines that will certainly 
cure, than to trust to the weaker 
and lose time with hazard to 
the Patient. 
 
54. Whether all Persons must 
not either Labour, Fast, use Physick, 
or be Sick? 
 
For such as will not Exercise, 
must eat Sparingly, and if they'll 
do neither, they must take Physick 
or be Sick, unless they have 
by the benefit of Nature, Evacuations 
proportionable to their 
Feeding and Sloth. The following 
rule of Health is not contemptible 
Eat when Hungry, 
Drink being Thirsty, Sleep when 
[^p.54^] 
Drowsie, and be never Idle. 
 
55. Whether great Feeders, if 
not as great Labourers, must not 
daily grow from a Horse-load to a 
Cart-load, or empty a Barrel of Excrements? 
 
For whatever is not discharged 
in proportion to what is received, 
must still remain behind, either 
for Fat, Diseases, or both. 
 
56. Whether 'tis not the peccant 
matter, moved by the Physick, and 
not the Physick, which in Purging 
and Vomiting, gripes and makes 
the Patient so Sick? 
 
For the same matter gives the 
like Sickness and Pain, when 
moved by Nature without Physick; 
and Physick gives little or 
no disturbance, when there is no 
diseased matter in the Body or 
none moved by it; Seneca says, 
[^p.55^] 
Remedia nulla sunt tam salutaria, 
quam quæ faciunt dolorem. It 
must needs therefore be a sign, 
when Evacuating Physick neither 
gripes nor indisposeth, that either 
the Patient needed none, or 
that what was taken, was too 
weak and improper to do him 
any good. 
 
57. Whether 'tis not much better 
to give strong and powerful Remedies 
at first whilst the Patient is 
vigorous, and the Disease weak, than 
to delay so long with gentle Medicines, 
as is too frequently practised, 
till the Disease is grown strong and 
the Patinet feeble? 
 
Where the Disease cannot certainly 
be overcome with gentle 
means, 'tis never prudent to hazard 
life by delay, whereby many 
a Patient hath been lost who 
[^p.56^] 
might have been saved by an 
earlier application of true and 
powerful Remedies. Post est occasio 
calva, & sero Medicina paratur. 
 
58. Whether Soldiers and Seamen, 
seasoned by the recovery out of 
epidemical Distempers, attending 
Camps and Fleets, are not afterwards 
less subject to fall ill again 
by disorders, and usually continue in 
Health a long time after? 
 
The reason for this seems to 
be, that such Diseases for the 
most part consume the greatest 
part of, if not all, the preternatural 
Humours at that time in the 
Body; and it will require again 
some considerable time before a 
sufficient quantity can be collected 
for another Sickness. Besides, 
Diseases usually fall on the 
Men, before custom and use hath 
[^p.57^] 
hardened them; so that every little 
unusual Disorder, which prejudiced 
them at first, hath afterwards 
no power over them. 
 
59. Whether any Flux whatsoever 
had better be stopt in the beginning 
with Astringent Remedies, 
or be cured by removing the cause 
with Evacuation? 
 
If no Flux or preternatural Eruption 
can happen, but by something 
received into the body of a 
loosening or purging quality; or 
else by the strength of Nature, endeavouring 
to free its self of some 
offending Humours, the first if 
it ceaseth not of its self, must be 
removed by some other evacuant 
the same way or some other; the 
last if nature proves insufficient 
to save it self by a critical Evacuation, 
must have the cause removed 
[^p.58^] 
by artificial cleansing, and 
not be kept in to a worse purpose 
by Astringents. 
 
60. Whether there is not the 
same reason and necessity for the 
Sick to take Physick, as for the 
Healthy food? 
 
Tho some may live many daies 
without Food and not be starved, 
and some Sick may live without 
Physick, and it may be, recover; 
yet none in their wits will voluntarily 
and knowingly make the 
experiment, unless they either 
want Money or Faith in Physick, 
for Medicine is as much Food for 
the Sick, as Food is Medicine for 
the Hungry. 
 
61. Whether God Almighty hath 
not as well furnished the World with 
Medicines for the Sick, as with Food 
for the Hungry? 
 
[^p.59^] 
God made nothing in vain; every 
Herb, Animal, and Mineral 
have their distinct uses, and properties; 
and 'tis the duty of Physicians 
diligently to examine, and 
carefully to observe what they 
are, and how they may be best 
applyed for the service of Mankind, 
which is truly called the 
Art of Physcik, and came down 
from Heaven. 
 
62. Whether this Art of Physick, 
or a right knowledge of Nature, 
and skill in Medicines with 
their various Operations in Humane 
Bodies, under different circumstances 
and affects, is not sometimes better 
acquired by faithful Instruction, 
by diligent Observation, and 
plain demonstration by Practice, 
than always by hard Study and Reading 
only? 
 
[^p.60^] 
If Reading and Study, without 
Instruction and Practice, were 
the best and only Method of attaining 
to the highest knowledge 
in Physick, then ought all Persons, 
that intend to follow the 
Practice, to continue at least 
Fifty or Sixty Years studying in 
the University, and, when they 
shall have Read and digested all 
the Physical Authors and form'd 
to themselves the best Method of 
Practice out of the confused heap 
of Contradictions to be met with 
amongst them, which is next to impossible, 
let them then commence 
Practice: But this at best can be 
but like a Traveller without a 
Guide, wandering up and down 
to the hazard of poor Mens lives. 
When under the conduct of an able 
Instructor, the shortest and 
[^p.61^] 
best ways are Trodden, and the 
Dangerous and Tedious avoided, 
and the ready way learnt for 
the future. 
 
63. Whether every Doctor in 
Physick is an able Physician? And 
whether he that hath most Practice 
is always the Ablest? 
 
If Medicus est qui sanat, non 
qui garrit, & sanitas est finis Medicinæ, 
non lucrum; Then he 
must always be the best Physician 
that cureth most in the same 
Number and like Cases, and not 
he that doth not, though he hath 
taken all his Degrees and the other 
none; and for such as are 
not well instructed, they ought 
to spend some longer time under 
the care of an Ancient Doctor 
of Skill and Experience, that they 
may not verifie the Proverb, That 
[^p.62^] 
young Physicians must kill such 
a Number, before they can be 
fit for Practice. Again, if bread 
is not to the wise, &c. it doth 
not then always follow, that he, 
who hath most Practice, is the 
Skilfullest: For, there are many 
little Artifices to bring Men into 
Practice, as Bribes, tatling 
Gossips, &c. which are much more 
effectual than the greatest Skill 
without their Assistance, and 
which no skillful Physician will 
stoop to use, when on the contrary 
Ignorant, Mercenary Pretenders 
diligently courts them. 
 
64. Whether 'tis not honester to 
prognosticate the Truth, at least to 
Friends and By-standers, though 
not always to the Patient; than 
constantly to foretel Danger, even 
when none appears? 
 
[^p.63^] 
Physicians of mighty Prudence 
and small Integrity ever gain by 
Frightful Prognosticks; for, if 
the Patient dies, their early Prognostick 
gives them great Reputation 
for knowing so long before, 
what must come to pass at last, 
and if the Patient recovers, the 
cure is the more Miraculous, because 
the condition was so Desperate. 
 
65. Whether Women with Child, 
and in Child-bed may not safely, 
when the Disease requires, both Vomit, 
Bleed and Purge, provided it 
be with good Caution? 
 
'Tis very probable, that the 
Disease which would have kill'd 
them for want of those Operations, 
when not with Child, or in 
Child-bed, would much sooner 
do it in both these cases; because 
[^p.64^] 
Nature hath not only the strength 
and power of the Disease, but 
the hazardous circumstance of a 
great Belly, or the weakness of 
Child-bed to struggle with. 
 
66. Whether a Physician should 
be chosen for Favour and Affection; 
or for his Skill and Integrity? 
 
Wise men choose their Physicians 
only for the help they expect 
from them in time of need, 
which they could have no reason 
to hope for, if they were not 
both able and honest. A skillful 
Turk is preferable to an ignorant 
Christian. 
 
67. Whether the practice of Physick 
is not of late become more a 
Trade or Profession to gain a Livelihood, 
than an Art to restore 
Health and save Lives? 
 
[^p.65^] 
The present Methods of Practice 
seem to be accommodated 
rather to answer the first part of 
the Quere, than the last. 
 
68. Whether Anatomy and Astrology, 
the first absolutely necessary 
for a Surgeon, and both very ornamental 
to a Physician, can better 
qualifie him for the healing of 
inward Diseases, than Fidling can 
qualifie a Barber for Shaving. 
 
It would be a good Service to 
the Publick for any to undertake to 
demonstrate plainly, wherein either 
helps the cure of any one 
inward Distemper; because many 
Students lose too much time in 
these inquiries, which might have 
been better spent in observing the 
Practice of Physick and some great 
Practitioners; and also because 
many are apt to put too great a 
[^p.66^] 
value, as most necessary, when in 
comparison of other more essential 
requisits to a Physician, they 
seem but trifles. 
 
69. Whether any can be so well 
qualified to Treat of Diseases, their 
Nature, Cause and Cure, as a 
Physician of long Experience, and 
much Observation? 
 
Young Physicians should not 
then be forward to attempt this 
Province. 
 
70. Whether success doth not ever 
attend the Seasonable use of 
proper means? 
 
Then, when Success is wanted, 
'tis because the wrong 
means were mis-taken for the 
right, or the right too late applyed, 
or misapplyed. 
 
71. Whether, as often as God 
blesseth Persons or things with Success, 
[^p.67^] 
he doth not direct to the seasonable 
use of means proper to the 
end aimed at and expected? 
 
To expect God's Blessing without 
the use of proper means, 
is not to trust, but to tempt God; 
His blessing never turns Stone 
and Sand into good Food and 
Nourishment, nor preserves any 
from drowning, who presumes 
to walk upon the Sea from Dover 
to Callais; things improbable may, 
by God's Blessing, answer a 
Mans Expectation, as a Man in 
necessity may sometimes cross to 
Calais in Wherry, or rotten 
Vessel, and Escape: But to undertake 
impossibilities is affronting, 
not trusting the Deity. 
 
72. Whether 'tis better for a 
Physician to be a Knave and increase 
his Practice by humouring the 
[^p.68^] 
Fools and letting them die their own 
way; or to be honest and lessen his 
practice in saving them with methods 
displeasing, because really there 
are no other can help them. 
 
An ingenious Gentleman was 
pleased to say upon this, That 
'tis better for the Patient, the 
Physician should be honest; tho 
'tis better for the Physician to be 
a Knave. 
 
73. Whether the Practice of 
Physick doth not very much want 
a just and due Regulation, and is 
not capable of great improvements 
for the benefit of Mankind? And 
whether it doth not well deserve 
such Reformation, since it concerns 
Life and Health, the dearest earthly 
injoyments? 
 
If the Government would undertake 
this task, besides the charity 
[^p.69^] 
to Mankind, it would wonderfully 
increase their own Glory, 
Riches, and Power by the increase 
of Subjects, in saving so 
many more lives. And that the 
Government might not be perswaded, 
they are not fit for such 
an Undertaking, they may 
please to consider it was first the 
Government, that constituted a 
College of Physicians, which 
they would never have done, had 
they not been able to judge of the 
usefulness of the Art, and 'tis as 
much in their Capacity, as their 
Power to reform the Abuses, even 
as 'tis in Judges to determine 
Differences in matters of the same 
Trade, amongst the members of 
the Trade, when the Arguments 
of the both sides are brought 
and argued before them. This 
[^p.70^] 
would give a more faithful account 
of the Abilities of Physicians 
than common fame now doth, 
wherein Interest and Affection 
generally rules. 
 
74. Whether there can be contrived 
(if the Government please) 
any just and proper Test or Standard 
whereby to try the several Abilities of 
Physicians much more truly and certainly 
than any we have at present? 
 
This were at least to be wisht, 
if there were no hopes to reduce 
it to practice, for not to know 
how to distinguish the skilful 
Physicians from the ignorant is 
next to having none, for want of 
which most wander without a 
Guide, and with the Proverb, 
sooner light on a Snake than an 
Eel, there being so many pretenders 
for any one truly qualified 
[^p.71^] 
for the Practice. Wrong ways 
are not wanting to misguide Patients, 
as common fame, which usually 
proves a Liar; some few 
mercenary Apothecaries, Midwives, 
and Nurses, who discredit 
the rest, by preferring their private 
gain to the Patients welfare: like 
the Porters at Billings-gate, who 
prefer the Oisters of that Boat 
they ply for. though they really 
stink, before all others, that are 
truly good, for no other reason 
than their own Gain. Faction, 
Party, and the fractions 
of Religion; Relation, Acquaintance, 
and good Fellowship; Time 
and Chance; togerher with a 
Plausible, Fawnign and Flattering 
behaviour; a good faculty of 
Gossiping, and using cramp 
Words; the reputation of a Scholar, 
[^p.72^] 
or Traveller, though it were 
but very little to purpose; and 
in fine any thing, but real skill, 
which slights all indirect Artifices, 
finds not many just and fit 
Judges, and therefore, stragling 
in the Dark, but few have the 
good fortune to meet it. There 
are commonly two other previous 
Tests, the first at the University, 
whether fit to be made a Doctor, 
the last at the College, 
wheter fit to be made a Member; 
but neither of these reach 
the true and necessary Qualifications 
of a Physician, which is the 
thing wanted and now desired. 
 
75. Whether 'tis not a necessary 
Duty of a Physician to consider diligently 
the Patients Strength as 
well as his Disease, and so to adapt 
the Remedies, as they be neither 
[^p.73^] 
too strong for the sick Patient, 
nor too weak to do them good? 
 
Cito tuto & jucunde, is an old 
known Rule in Physick, in which 
thid duty is certainly included and 
always observed by a good Physician; 
for as, on the one hand, 
a Medicine too strong may destroy 
a Patient: So, on the other, 
one too weak may let them die, 
which differs little to the Patient. 
An Eminent Doctor long since 
Dead, had, in the absence of the 
Author, prescribed a Course for 
a person of great Quality's young 
Child: upon the Author's return 
he gave (being demanded) the following 
Opinion of it, That the 
prescription was proper to the 
Disease, but not well accommodated 
to the particular case of the 
Child, for the Method could not 
[^p.74^] 
take effect in less than a Fortnight, 
and the Child would die 
in two daies, as it did. This 
Query is thought necessary to be 
here inserted; because, no caution 
is so much urged by the Relations 
and By-standers, as to regard 
the Patients strength, which 
is althogether needless to good 
Physicians, and very prejudicial 
oft-times in discouraging them to 
proceed as they ought. Riverius 
observing the many mischiefs 
by Womens Gossiping, cannot 
forbear taking notice of it in 
these Words, Nostratium mulierum 
nequitia, omnes infaustos eventus 
Remediis ascribentium, efficit, 
ut etiam prudentiores medicimetu 
calumniæ, ab utilissimis interdum 
abstineant. 
 
[^p.75^] 
76. Whether the most effectual 
Method to sweeten the Blood, so 
much and often desired by many, is 
not to carry off by Evacuation, that 
which sowres and spoils it? 
 
The remarks upon the third 
Query may not impertinently be 
here considered. All the sweetners 
in vogue, either purge by Urine, 
Sweat or insensible Perspiration, 
as Tunbridge, Spaw, Sarsa, 
crude Antimony, Pearl, Asses 
Milk, &c. or else 'tis the work 
of Air and Time, though Remedies 
often have the credit of the 
Cure. 
 
77. Whether the mineral Waters 
sweeten the Blood by some specifick 
quality, or not rather by a 
purging or diuretick quality? 
 
We are certain they do this 
last, the other is not so apparent. 
 
[^p.76^] 
78. Wheher the Mineral Waters 
abstracted from Air, Exercise, 
Company, and the like, are in any 
respect more effectual or convenient, 
than other Remedies prepared by Apothecaries, 
and formerly more in 
use? 
 
It is certain the great quantity 
required to make them effectual 
is none of their best Qualifications, 
they may distend the part, 
and over cool too much, cause 
Cholicks, and Convulsions; and 
as all other Remedies are vary'd 
to the Patients case, so here you 
must diligently inquire, whether 
the Patients case will fit the Waters, 
which 'tis most certain all 
that go thither do not. 
 
79. Whether, to make a right 
Judgment of the Waters for the 
publick Benefit, a Register ought not 
[^p.77^] 
to be kept by a qualified Person, of 
the Diseases and Inconveniences of 
all that drink the several Waters; 
of the accidents that happen in the 
drinking them, and the success and 
health of the Patient for at leat 
six Months after? 
 
By this means there would be 
a true History of the Cures, to 
inform the judgment of Physicians 
much better, which can only 
by chance now direct the Patient 
right, and consequently 'twould 
prove much for the Patients advantage. 
 
80. Whether a Cure may not 
be wrought by a course of Physick, 
some weeks before the Patient plainly 
perceives it? 
 
'Tis as reasonable to judge it 
may, as for Diseases not to appear 
till long after the occasion 
[^p.78^] 
given, which causeth it, and of 
this there are many Examples. A 
Cancer in the Breast is not 
found in some Years after a 
Blow given, which was the 
cause. A Woman may not miscarry, 
in some Weeks after a 
Fright, which occasioned it. And 
it is this which makes so many 
mistakes, both of the Causes and 
Cures of Distempers. That ofttimes 
cured the Patient, which 
he believed would kill him, and 
a Cordial had the credit, which 
contributed nothing to it. The 
last Physician and Medicine commonly 
hath the Reputation of 
curing though it was the first 
that did it indeed. If this 
were not so, there could never 
have been so many cures 
for a Tooth-ach, which certainly 
fail the next time they are 
[^p.79^] 
tryed; but, hapning to be applyed, 
when the pain was going 
off for the present (as no Distemper 
though never so violent, 
but hath Remissions if not 
Periods) they being the last applyed 
were recorded for the 
cure, when any other at that 
time, must have had the same 
good Success. 
 
81. Whether more Patients have 
not died by not hindring, or not removing 
the Disease with proper and 
seasonable Evacuations, than by attempting 
to remove them with Evacuating 
Remedies? 
 
Most Persons that die before 
extreme old Age, might by a natural 
possibility have had their 
lives prolonged to Old Age. To 
Moral possibility many things 
must concurr, as the Obedience 
[^p.80^] 
and Wisdom of the Patient, the 
Skill, Care, and Honesty of the 
Physician, besides outward accidents, 
as Murther, Drowning, 
the falling of a House, and infinite 
others, without the Power 
of either Physician or Patient. V. 
the 21 Query. 
 
82. Whether the Jesuit's Pouder 
makes not double work for the 
Doctor? 
 
Without doubt, his first Business 
is to cure the Ague with it; 
the next to cure the Patient of 
it. 
 
83. Whether most Fevers do not 
take their rise from the primæ 
viæ? 
 
Most certainly, for though the 
Air was Pestilential, or the passions 
Extravagant, if there were 
not suitable matter treasured up 
[^p.81^] 
in the primæ viæ, no sort of 
Fever would ensue. 
 
84. Whether, if Fevers begin 
in the primæ viæ, and are maintained 
from thence, Bleeding can 
be so proper a Remedy as Vomiting 
or Purging; or whether it is necessary 
at all to Bleed, or fit to begin 
with it? 
 
Whatever is seated in the primæ 
viæ is sooner and easier expelled 
by Vomit and Stool. It may 
be often convenient to bleed in 
Fevers, tho 'tis but seldom necessary: 
But it seems preposterous 
to begin the cure of any Fever 
with Bleeding except a Plethora. 
 
85. Whether Patients are not 
more weakned by Bleeding than by 
Vomit or Purge? 
 
If the animal Spirits arise immediately 
out of the Blood, as 
[^p.82^] 
'tis generally agreed, and that 
they give strength, the 'tis 
most probable there are more 
Spirits contained in an ounce of 
Blood, than in an ounce of the 
expell'd Excrements. 
 
86. Whether it is not highly 
reasonable to believe, that Choler 
is the cause of the Disease, and 
Vomiting the cure; when Patients, 
that are very Sick, are wonderfully 
easied and relieved, after having 
Vomited of themselves without Medicines 
a quantity of Green, Yellow, 
or Black Choler? 
 
This scarce deserves a Dispute, 
since there is seldom a sick Person, 
but hath experimentally 
found a manifest relief after spontaneous 
Vomiting, though very 
dangerously ill before. And so, 
as oft as they Vomit, they are 
[^p.83^] 
sensible of a temporary ease, 
which deserves their careful observation 
to convince them of the 
Truth hereof.
