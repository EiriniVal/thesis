[}The Marrow of Physick.}] 
 
THE most glorious and great 
Workeman, who excels all 
Wisedome, and is beyond 
all understanding, the most 
potent, wise, and mercifull 
Father, who is the uniter of 
all creatures, and by whom 
they have their being, who 
is the most potent and most 
excellent, being before all things, and having no need 
of any thing, but being sufficient in himself, and remaining 
in the most unsearchable closet of his Divinity, and 
out of his aboundant goodnesse willing to bring foorth 
things thought and determined on from all Eternity, 
did in the beginning create a certain essence of things, 
being, as it were, scarce fashioned into any shape, which 
by some is called the fountain or head from whence all 
other things flowed; by others, an empty plot of earth, 
producing nothing at all; by others, a Chaos; by some 
the mother of the world, the foundation of nature; but 
certainly the first he created was four Simples, which 
[^p.2^] 
are the four Elements of one and the same essence or 
matter, but of divers formes or qualities; and these, as 
I will shew heerafter more at large, are called Fire, Water, 
Earth, and Aire; and out of these he created all the 
rest that now are, both the things that are above, and 
also those beneath us: and that for this reason, because 
the creatures intended to be made, might be extracted 
from a certaine root, whereby they might multiply and 
increase in the world. Therefore first of all God created 
the four elements, out of which he afterwards created 
what he pleased: to wit, divers natures as the elements 
are divers: for if the elements had been made all 
of one nature, then had all creatures been so likewise. 
Now of this first matter he created the Angels, which 
he made only of Fire, not of firm substantiall fire, for 
then it must have been necessary that they had eaten, 
drank, and slept; but he made them of the most purest 
and thinnest part of pure, thin, and simple fire: and therfore 
they neither eat, drink, nor sleep. God created 
the Sun, Moon, and Stars of two elements, Aire, and 
Fire: and therefore are the Angels more bright, then 
either the Sun, Moon, or Stars, because they are created 
of one and that the most rare element; the other of 
Fire and Aire compounded. 
 
God made the Heaven of Water and Aire, so it is 
compounded of one rare or light element, that is Aire, 
and of another heavy, that is Water: but he created the 
Fowls and brute Beasts of three elements, and also the 
Vegitables, that is to say, of Aire, Water, and Earth: 
certain are of the Earth and Aire; others of Fire, Aire, 
and Earth; of the last are the Fowls, and all things wherin 
remaineth a spirit; of the first are the vegetables, but 
[^p.3^] 
all bruit Beasts are of Earth, Aire and Fire, but the Vegetables 
of Earth, Water, and Aire, and they likewise 
partake of a kind of thin Fire, brought in with the Aire; 
and therfore when we say that Fire is in the Vegetables, 
we mean that thin fire that being in the aire is carried 
by it and with it into them. 
 
God made Man of the four elements; as the most excellent 
peece of all his workmanship: he made him according 
to his own image naturally, according to his similitude 
spiritually; and from hence the Ancients gathered, 
that there were four worlds: the first whereof 
was ultra mundanum, which the Divines call Angelical, 
and the Philosophers Intellectuall: The next was, the 
Celestiall: The third, the Sublunar, which we inhabit: 
The last was Man, in whom all the rest were found: 
whereto the Schoolmen alluding, call Man the Microcosmos, 
or lesser World, in whom there is a mixture of 
the four elements; a spirit celestiall, a vegetable soul, 
and the sence and reason of brute beasts, an angelicall 
minde, and finally the whole similitude of God. Now as 
God hath made Man in this excellency, so he hath subjected 
all these things under him, and so fitted them to 
his use, that there is no disease can happen to our bodies, 
whereto the earth brings not forth a convenient medicine; 
and from hence sprung the originall of Physick, 
whereof divers have attained to such excellency, as that 
they have been worshipped for Gods: therefore for the 
further instructing of those that shall practice any of 
these my experiments, I have thought it convenient to 
publish such notes as I have in my Studies gathered 
from the best Authours that have written concerning 
the laudable Science of Physicke, and the Practice 
[^p.4^] 
thereof, which shall serve as a compendious Introduction 
to my Booke. 
 
Hippocrates called physicke an addition, and a substraction: 
[/1./] 
an addition of things necessary, and a substraction 
or taking away of the superfluous. Wherein he includes 
two principall offices of a Physitian, for a disease 
proceeds either from too much emptinesse, or from too 
much fulnesse. The first whereof is cured by adding 
what is wanting, and the latter by taking away that 
which exceedes. 
 
Galen calls physicke a science of the healthfull, unhealthfull, 
and neuters, which are neither well, nor can 
properly be said to be sicke: and this is made good 
three waies; as the body, as the cause, and as the signe; 
that body is counted healthfull that enjoyes his perfect 
health, that cause is healthfull that procures health and 
is the meanes of preserving it. The healthfull signe doth 
show or indicate the present health; the unhealthfull 
body is affected with a disease, which is generated by an 
unhealthfull cause, and the manner and greatnesse of 
the griefe is showne by the unhealthfull signe: a body is 
said to be neither healthfull nor sicke, when it is as it 
were declining and cannot be said to be perfectly well, 
nor altogether sicke. 
 
But the more vulgar and common definition of physicke 
is this; Physicke is an art which preserves health in 
the sound, and restores it to the sicke, and preserves the 
neuters that are neither well nor sicke; and from hence 
it is said to be an art of things naturall; not naturall, and 
against nature, the former were according to the theory, 
these are according to the practique. 
 
Things naturall doe agree with our nature, and are 
[^p.5^] 
those things whereof our body is compacted and made, 
and are in number seven, viz. Elements, Temperaments, 
Humours, Members, Faculties, Operations, 
and Spirits. Things not naturall are those meane and 
indifferent things whereby the body is preserved in 
health, and are six in number: Aire, Meate and Drinke, 
Sleepe and Watching, Labour and Rest, Fulnesse and 
Emptinesse, or repletion and inanition, and perturbations 
of the minde. Things against nature are those that 
doe destroy our health, and are of three sorts: A Disease, 
the cause of a Disease, and a Symptome. Hereby you 
may understand the two parts, of Physicke; Theoricke, 
and Practique; and by the Theoricke know every disease 
and the quality thereof; and by the Practique to 
preserve health and cure a disease, by the due administration 
of things not naturall, and by removing of those 
that are against nature. 
 
Things naturall, and which properly belong to the 
constitution of our body are (as I said before) in number 
seven:

[^p.6^] 
[}CHAPTER I. 
Of Elements.}] 
 
[/2./] 
AN Element is the most least, and simple 
portion whereof any thing is made, 
and in the destruction thereof is lastly 
resolved; which to say plainely, the 
foure first and simple bodies which accommodate 
and subject themselves to 
the generation of all manner of things, be the mixture 
perfect or imperfect. Thus Aristotle called the Heaven 
an Element, counting five parts of the world, Heaven, 
Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth. Of Elements we reckon 
foure, whereof two are grosse and heavy, and move 
downewards, as Earth and Water; and two are light, 
and strive upwards, as Fire and Aire. Earth is a simple 
body whose naturall place is the center of the universe, 
in which it naturally remaines solid, and still round as 
an apple, in the middle whereof (as the antient Philosopher 
writes) is the pit of hell, like as the blacke kernels 
lyeth in the midst of the apple, and at the day of doome 
when all things shal be renewed, then shall this Element 
be made a thousand fold more transparent and brighter 
then the Christall or any pretious Stone, that they that 
are in the bitter paines of hell (to their encrease of torment) 
shall through it behold the blisfull joyes of 
heaven, which will be more paine to them then all the 
torments of hell. Earth is of nature cold and dry. 
 
Water is also a simple body whose naturall place is 
[^p.7^] 
to compas the earth; it is light in respect of the earth, but 
heavie in respect of the fire and aire: therefore Reolanus 
saith, that the earth holds the lowest part, because of it's 
heavinesse, and the fire because it is absolutly light, hath 
the highest place: the aire and water because they are, as 
it were, equally heavie or light, have the middle place: 
water being heavier then the ayre, lighter then the earth: 
the nature of water is cold and moist. 
 
Aire is a simple body, whose naturall place is above 
the Water, and under the Fire, and is by nature hot and 
moist. 
 
Fire is also a simple body, whose naturall place is above 
all the elementary parts, because it is a hollow superficies 
of the Heavens, and by its absolute lightnesse, 
striveth upward even to Heaven: its nature is hot & dry; 
these are so contrary in nature, that they cannot be joined 
without a meane, which is a temperament which 
fals out next to be treated of. 
 
[}CHAP. II. 
Of Temperaments.}] 
 
[/3./] 
A Temperament therefore is a concord or 
mixture of the former disagreeing elements 
or a mixture of hot, cold, moist, 
and drie. 
 
Of these temperaments which are in 
number nine, eight are called distemperate, 
and one temperate. 
 
The temperate is also devided either to temperature 
[^p.8^] 
of weight or temperature of justice, but we call it not a 
temperature to weight wherein the elements are mingled 
by a like heape or weight, but where it is exquisitely 
made temperate by the equall mixture of the foure first 
qualities, wherein no quality exceeds, but wherein all 
equality is included, and that as if it were put in 
a ballance it drawes downe neither to this nor that 
parte. 
 
[/4./] 
A temperament to justice is that which is conveniently 
temperate to the vse that nature hath appointed and 
destinated it, therefore all those things that have taken 
from nature a mixture of the elements (though unequall, 
yet agreeable to motion and use) are called temperaments 
secundum justitiam, as if wee see any living 
creature that performes the functions of nature aptly 
and as is ought to doe, we say he hath a temperament 
secundum justitiam, according to justice. 
 
The distemperate temperament is double, simple and 
compound; the simple wherin one only quality exceeds 
the other two contemperate, as hot, cold, moist, dry, hot 
in which the heate hath the dominion over the cold 
(the moist and drie, being temperate) cold, in which 
the cold excels the heate (the other two being temperate.) 
 
The compound in which two qualities exceed, and 
this is hot, and moist, or hot and drie, cold and moist or 
cold and drie; for the first qualities may be joyned within 
themselves six manner of waies, but heate cannot be 
joyned with cold, nor moisture with drinesse, because 
they are in themselves contrary, neither can they remaine 
together in one subject. 
 
Heere may be added the temperatures of the seasons 
[^p.9^] 
of the yeere, which are four; Spring, Summer, Autumn, 
and Winter, and are in nature hot, cold, moist, 
and drie. 
 
[/5./] 
The Spring is the most temperate, as being neither 
too cold and moist, as the Winter, nor too hot and dry, 
as the Summer: from hence Hippocrates cals the Spring 
the most healthfullest time of the yeere, and lesse subject 
to dangerous diseases, then any other season; for 
it never breeds any disease, but onely produces such as 
have been breeding in the body all the Winter precedent. 
 
[/6./] 
Summer is hot and drie, and a breeder of cholericke 
diseases, which proceed from too much bloud, generated 
in the Spring, and now become adust, and these diseases 
are for the most part speedy in running their 
course. 
 
[/7./] 
The Autumn is very unequall, for when it is drie it 
hath great inequality of heat and cold; the mornings 
and evenings being very cold, and the noondaies exceeding 
hot, whereby many long and dangerous diseases 
are ingendred. 
 
[/8./] 
The Winter is cold and moist of temper; it excites 
naturall heat and appetite, and augments phlegme. After 
this maner are we to consider the ages of man which 
are agreeable to the four quarters of the yeere. 
 
[}Of Ages.}] 
 
AN Age is the space of life, in which the constitution 
[/9./] 
of our bodies of its selfe doth encrease, stand, 
decrease, and utterly decline, whose whole course hath 
five ages or speciall mutations. The first whereof is 
[^p.10^] 
[/10./] 
Infancy, which is hot and moist, and lasteth from the 
first houre of the birth untill the eighteenth year of age, 
and is governed by the Moone; and this the age wherein 
the body by reason of the moisture continually 
groweth and encreaseth, and is subject to Feavours, 
Fluxes, Wormes in the belly, Stone, Aposthumes, and 
divers other diseases. 
 
Youth is temperate, in which there is augmentation 
[/11./] 
neither of heate, drinesse nor cold: in this age the voice 
beginneth to grow great in men, and the paps encrease 
in women, and this lasteth untill the five and twentieth 
yeare. 
 
[/12./] 
The next is mans estate, which is hot and drie, in which 
moisture cannot be said to augment nor diminish, but 
the body remaines according to the course of nature: it 
lasteth not above the thirty fifth or fortieth yeare, this 
age is subject to hot agues, feavers, frenzies, and sundry 
other maladies, it is governed by Venus, and is named by 
Avicen, the beautifull age. 
 
[/13./] 
The fourth is the decreasing or declining age, which 
is by some devided into three, but (by most of our latest 
writers) onely into two; the first whereof is to the forty 
ninth or fiftieth yeare, and is cold and drie, in which the 
moisture is diminished without any manifest debility 
of the strength, so that they are able to undergoe divers 
affaires, and are prudent, wise, and fit to governe commonwelths, 
for this age is governed by Iupiter. 
 
[/14./] 
The seco~d part of old age, and which stands for the fift 
part is called, the decrepit age; & is cold and dry, because 
the humidum radicale, the radicall moisture is decayed: 
it is governed by Saturne and is subject to Epilepsie, lithargie, 
numnesse and the like: this age hath no distinct 
[^p.11^] 
period, but ends yeares and life together, and is called 
the end of age and life, wherein the memorie and senses 
decay, the judgement faileth, and they are as it were infants 
againe. 
 
But we cannot measure these ages by certaine proportion 
of yeares, because divers seeme older at forty, then 
others at threescore or threescore and tenne. 
 
And now because these ages are governed and altered 
by the influence of the planets, therefore I will breifely 
shew you the natures of them, and first the natures of the 
twelue signes, of the Zodiacke, whereby mans body is 
governed, and with whom the 7 planets worke by influence. 
 
There are foure triplicities of signes, three of the water 
Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces; three of the earth, Taurus, Capricorne, 
Virgo; three of the fire, as Aries, Leo Sagittarius; 
and three of the aire, as Gemini, Libra, Aquarius; to these 
are agreeable the seaven planets in their qualities and 
working, in the severall ages of mans life: Iupiter and 
Venus are good planets: Saturne and Mars evill: Sol and 
Luna indifferent: Mercury is good with the good, and 
evill with the evill: and these seaven superior planets do 
worke by influence with the seaven celestiall signes in 
the bodies of all living creatures, and are agreeable with 
the foure elements, and the foure parts of the world, as 
before I shewed you, which for the better understanding 
I will thus devide: 
 
[^p.12^] 
[^Beginning of a list figure in two columns.^] 
Cancer 
Scorpio 
Pisces 
	are of the nature of water 
Gemini 
Libra 
Aquarius 
	are of the nature of the aire 
[^A column change.^] 
Aries 
Leo 
Sagittarius 
	are of the nature of fire. 
Taurus 
Capricornus 
Virgo 
	are of the nature of the earth. 
[^End of the list figure in two columns.^] 
 
And these twelve signes are again devided into three 
quaternions, or three fours of different qualitie, in this 
sort and diversity of nature: viz. four are moveable, 
four are fixt, and four are called common signes. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure in three columns.^] 
Aries 
Cancer 
Libra 
Capricorne 
	are moveable 
[^A column change.^] 
Taurus 
Leo 
Scorpio 
Aquarius 
	are fixed 
[^A column change.^] 
Gemini 
Virgo 
Sagittarius 
Pisces 
	are common signes. 
[^End of a list figure in three columns.^] 
 
Some of these are Orientall of the East, and some 
are Occidentall of the West, some are Meridionall of 
the South, and some are Septentrionall of the North. 
 
These twelve signes are also agreeable to the foure 
cardinall winds, and some are of the day, and some of 
the night, 
& some are 
masculine, 
and some 
are feminine. 
 
[^Beginning of a table in four columns.^]

[}Airie.}] 
[^A column change.^] 
[}North}] 
Cancer 
Scorpio 
Pisces 
[}Watry.}] 
[^End of a table in four columns.^] 
 
But note, 
that these are not proper beasts, as they are named, 
but named and likened to such beasts, by way of Philosophy, 
[^p.13^] 
for they are onely the twelve parts of the firmament, 
of which each part hath a certaine number of 
Starres assigned, and are called the proper houses of the 
seven Planets, in which they rest and abide a certaine 
time. The three quaternions of the twelve signes doe 
governe in divers parts of our bodies, whereof foure 
there be that rule the inward parts, called spirituall members. 
viz. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Cancer Rule these parts in a mans body. viz. The Liver and Lunges. 
Leo [^Rule these parts in a mans body. viz.^] The Heartstrings and Backe. 
Virgo [^Rule these parts in a mans body. viz.^] The Stomack, and the mouth of the Stomacke, Midriffe and Bowells. 
Libra [^Rule these parts in a mans body. viz.^] The Loynes and Navell. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
 
[^Beginning of a list in four columns.^] 
And of 
these are 
ingendred these 
severall 
diseases. 
viz. 
[^A column change.^] 
Cancer. 
Leo. 
Virgo. 
Libra. 
[^A column change.^] 
causeth 
the 
[^A column change.^] 
Cough, Ptisicke, and Pleurisie, 
Imposthumes, Iaundies, 
Feavers, & Pestilence, 
Swelling of the Belly, 
Dropsie, Hardnesse of the 
Belly & Collicke Passion, 
Exulceration of the Bowels, 
Pain in the Belly, and about 
the Small of the back. 
[^End of a list in four columns.^] 
 
And these evill affects are chiefly engendred when 
the signes aforesaid are in the houses that are evill; as 
the sixt house, the eight house, and the twelfe house 
from the ascendant. 
 
A Planet is a Starre which is discording or differing 
from the lesser Starres in forming and working, for 
they are greater, and of more power then those that are 
lesse. 
[^p.14^] 
The Moone is said much to alter the constitution of 
our bodies by those signes wherein she enters; therefore 
I shall first declare unto you the twelve signes, and 
the parts they governe, and consequently the diseases 
caused by the influence of the Moone in every one of 
those signes. 
 
First, Aries hath his place in the head, face, eares; 
and the diseases are headach, toothach, paine in the 
eyes, pimples, morphew, scurfe in the face, and such 
like. 
 
Taurus governeth the necke and throate; and the diseases 
are the Kings-evil, hoarsenesse in the throate, weaknesse 
in the necke, and blacke chollar or melancholy, 
squinances, catarrhes, and other diseases of the necke 
throate. 
 
Gemini ruleth the shoulders, armes, hands, and fingers, 
and their diseases proceeding of bloud in the said 
parts; as frankles and such like, and some comming of 
phlegme. 
 
Cancer hath dominion in the pappes, breast, ribs, the 
upper part of the belly, part of the stomacke, the spleen 
and lungs; it ruleth over phlegmaticke humours, and 
denoteth impediments in the eyes, darkenesse in the 
sight, spots and pustles in the face, the scab, leprosie, 
lithargy, galling of the skinne, and evill sickenesses of 
the body and face comming of phlegme. 
 
Leo governeth the heart, neather part of the stomack, 
and ribs, backebone, sides, small guts, and the liver, and 
the sickenesse proceeding from chollar citrine, and others 
as trembling of the heart, swounding, &c. 
 
Virgo ruleth the belly, intrailes, midriffe, and over 
melancholy, and signifieth all ill humours, proceeding 
[^p.15^] 
of melancholy, as Iliaco passio, collica passio and the like. 
 
Libra hath dominion in the reynes, and loynes, neather 
part of the belly, navell, hanches, and buttockes, 
and over blood, and specifieth dimnes of sight, retention 
of Urine, and of digestion of fluxes, and the 
like. 
 
Scorpio ruleth the secret parts, the bladder, and parts 
of generation, and the flanckes, and over phlegmaticke 
humours, and aquosities, and showeth lepry, scabs, spots 
in the face, cankers, fistulaes, hemorhoids, the stone, falling 
of the haire, scurfes, and deformed diseases in 
the face, and all the body poisoned by medicine. 
 
Sagittarius hath his dominion in the thighes, with the 
apurtenances, and all superfluous parts, as a fixt part 
of the fingers, &c. and over choller, and the diseases 
proceeding thereof, as Feavers, Agues, falls from high 
places, darkenesse or impediments of the eyes, and 
from the sixteenth degree to the eighteenth, he signifieth 
hurts by horses, and wounds. 
 
Capricorne governeth the knees and their diseases, 
leprosie, scabs, galls, defects of the skinne, losse of 
hearing, speech, and sight, feavers, issues of blood in 
the inferiour parts, and fluxes also, and diseases comming 
of melancholy. 
 
Aquarius ruleth the legs and their diseases proceeding 
of blood, blacke jaundise, quartaine feavers, inscision 
of the veines; and from the twentieth degree to 
the five and twentieth, it noteth paines in the eyes. 
 
Pisces hath dominion in the feete, and over their diseases, 
as the gout, scab, leprosie, palsie, paine in the 
feete, galls in the skin, and ulcers, and is a signe very 
sickely and phlegmaticke. These are the proper significations 
[^p.16^] 
of the signes by themselves, or when the Moone 
is in them passing through all the parts of mans body; 
yet notwithstanding the Moone and other Planets have 
divers and severall significations in all the signes particularly 
appropriative to themselves, very necessary to 
be observed, having speciall relation to the part of the 
body diseased and grieved, as may appeare by what is 
said; whereby it is thought very evill to administer any 
medicine to the part which is governed of any signe, the 
day that the Moone is in it, except necessity urge; nor 
to make any incision in any member, least efflux of 
blood follow, and diverse other inconveniences. 
 
The Ancients also considered the twelve monethes 
of the yeare, with the twelve signes, in which they are 
said to worke according to their nature, one with another; 
but each one hath his severall month wherein he 
properly raignes. 
 
[/15./] 
And first raignes Aries in the month of March, for in 
that signe (say they) God made the world, and to this 
signe the old Iewish Philosophers gave the name of 
Aries: that is to say, a Ram; forasmuch as Abraham 
made his offering to God of a Ram, for his sonne Isaac; 
and whosoever is borne in this signe shall be timerous 
or dreadfull; but he shall have grace and good inclination. 
 
[/16./] 
The second signe Taurus, raigneth in April, it hath 
the name of Bull; forasmuch as Iacob wrastled and 
strove with the Angel: Whosoever is borne in this 
signe shal have good successe in all manner of beasts and 
cattle of the field. 
 
[/17./] 
The third signe Gemini, raigneth in May; it hath the 
name of twinnes, forasmuch as Adam and Eve were 
[^p.17^] 
formed, and made of one kind: Whosoever is borne in 
this signe, poore, and feeble shall he be, and shall live in 
griefe, because Adam, and Eve bewailed their fall. 
 
[/18./] 
The fourth, Cancer raigneth in Iune, and hath the 
name Crab, or Canker, forasmuch as Iob was full of Leprosie, 
and Kankrous Sores, which is a Worme that 
through the permission of God, eateth the flesh: Whosoever 
is borne in this signe, he shall be feeble of body, 
but shall obtaine grace, if he seek it of God. 
 
[/19./] 
The fift signe, Leo raigneth in Iuly, and hath the name 
of a Lyon; forasmuch as Daniel the Prophet was put 
into a Lyons den: Whosoever is borne in this signe 
shall be a bold, and stout man, and a hardy. 
 
The sixt signe Virgo raignes in August, and hath the 
[/20./] 
name of a Virgin, forasmuch as our Lady that blessed 
Virgin before birth, in birth, and after birth, was a pure 
Virgin: Whosoever is borne under this signe, shall be 
wise, and learned, and shall suffer blame for a just 
cause. 
 
[/21./] 
The seventh signe, Libra raigneth in September, and 
hath the name of the ballance that hang in equall poise, 
forasmuch as Iudas Iscariot tooke counsell with the 
Iewes for the betraying of our Saviour: Whosoever is 
borne in this signe, he shall be a wicked man, and a traytor: 
an evill death shall he dye if the course of nature 
prevaile, but if he seeke after grace and mercy, he may 
escape it. 
 
[/22./] 
The eight signe, Scorpio raigneth in October, and 
hath the name of a Scorpion, forasmuch as the children 
of Israel passed through the Red Sea: Whosoever is 
borne in this signe shall have many angers, tribulations, 
and vexations. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[/23./] 
The ninth signe Sagittarius, raigneth in November, 
and hath the name of the Archer, forasmuch as David 
fought with Goliah: Whosoever is borne under this 
signe shall be hardy, and lecherous. 
 
[/24./] 
The tenth signe Capricornus raigneth in December, 
and hath the name of the Goat, forasmuch as the Iewes 
lost the blessing of our Lord Iesus Christ: Whosoever 
is borne under this signe shall be rich, and loving. 
 
[/25./] 
The eleventh signe Aquarius raigneth in Ianuary, and 
hath the name of the water-man; forasmuch as Saint 
Iohn Baptist baptised our Saviour in the flood of Iordan 
to beginne to institute the new law of Baptisme, and end 
the old law of Circumcision: Whosoever is borne in 
this signe sh_[^ORIG. BLANK^]ll be negligent, and lose his goods, and shall 
be carelesse in his course of life. 
 
[/26./] 
The twelveth signe Pisces, raigneth in February, and 
hath the name of fishes; forasmuch as Ionas the Prophet 
was cast into the sea, and three daies, and three 
nights lay in the belly of a Whale: Whosoever is borne 
in that signe shall be gratious, and happy, if he make use 
of time. 
 
But note that neither the planets, nor the signes wherin 
they worke do constraine any man to doe good, or 
evill, but he may (by his owne will, and the grace of 
God) doe good, although he be disposed to evill after 
the nature, and influence of his planet, and on the contrary 
by his owne evill inclination he may doe evill, 
though by his planet he be disposed to good. 
 
Saturne hath the highest place of all the planets, which 
[/27./] 
hee compasseth once in thirty yeares, and is a planet 
wicked, and an enemy to humane nature; a destroyer of 
life, cold, drie, earthly, and is masculine of the day, he 
[^p.19^] 
rules the right eare, spleene, bladder, and bones, melancholy 
humours mixt with flegme, he hath dominion 
over old men, solitary, stubborne, leane, covetous, and 
gluttonous persons, the greatnesse of his body is 91 
times so big as the earth, his character is thus. [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] 
 
[/28./] 
Iupiter ends his course almost in twelve yeares, he is a 
planet benevolent, good, hot and moist; he rules the 
liver, lights, lungs, arteries, bloud, and seed, and the 
left eare, humours sanguine, humble, just, honest, true, 
liberall, and rich Persons, Prelates, and Bishops: his 
character is thus [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] the greatnesse of his body is 95. 
times so big as the earth. 
 
[/29./] 
Mars circleth his sphere once in two yeares almost, 
he is a planet hot, and drie immoderately, governes the 
gall, veines, sinewes, and stones, the humour cholericke, 
disdainefull, seditious, cruell, bold, and carelesse persons: 
the greatnesse of his body is once so bigge as the 
earth, and halfe so bigge, and an eight part, his character 
is thus. [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] 
 
Sol the lampe of heaven, he passeth through the twelve 
[/30./] 
signes of the Zodiack in three hundred threescore, and 
five daies, he giveth life naturall to all things, and is a 
planet moderately hot, and drie, masculine of the day, 
he rules the braine, marrow, and joyntes, kings, princes, 
magistrates, and famous persons, the greatnesse of his 
body is 166. times so bigge as the earth, his character

Venus endeth her course as doth the sunne, she is a planet 
[/31./] 
feminine of the night, cold, and moist temperate, she 
rules the throate, pappes, belly, reines, matrix, and buttocks, 
and humours phlegmatick, governeth persons 
that are meeke, pleasant, lovers, dancers, musitians, and 
[^p.20^] 
Poets; the greatnesse of her body is the 37 part of the

Mercury maketh his course as the Sun and Venus, he 
[/32./] 
is a planet variable, unequall, good with the good, and 
bad, with the bad, sometimes masculine of the day, and 
sometimes feminine of the night, hot with the hot, and 
cold with the cold, moist with the moist, and drie with 
the drie planets, whichsoever he is configured unto; he 
rules the mouth, tongue, thoughts, and memorie, devisers 
of any subtilty, or craft, crafty, deceitfull, proud, 
unconstant, and lying persons; the greatnesse of his body 
is the 32000. part of the earth; his character is this. [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] 
 
Luna the moone makes her passage through the Zodiacke 
[/33./] 
in nine and twenty daies and eight houres, and 
overtakes the Sunne in nine and twenty daies and twelue 
houres, or thereabouts; she is a planet naturally cold and 
moist, of the night feminine; she is the carrier of the influence 
of all the planets through her orbe unto us, she 
rules the stomacke, tast, liver, and the left side; she governes 
noble women, widdowes, also mariners, and 
vagabondes, and humors phlegmatike; the greatnesse 
of her body is the 39. part of the earth; her character 
is thus. [^Symbol of the Moon omitted.^] 
 
It shall be also necessary to consider the place, country, 
soyle, windes, and waters; their good effects, and 
their bad, the temperature of the climate, and the nature 
of the foure cardinall windes, East, which is hot and 
drie: West, which is cold and moist: North, which is 
cold and drie: South, which is hot and moist. 
 
These I have the rather insisted upon, because I find 
them so necessary to be knowne, and duely considered 
in the administring of medicines. 
 
[^p.21^] 
[}CHAP. III. 
Of Humours.}] 
 
AN humour is whatsoever is moist, and liquid 
in substance, into which the nourishment 
is first converted in the body 
of living creatures endewed with 
bloud, and is called an humour, not because 
all of them have one, and the 
same force of moistning, but because all of them have a 
fluent substance. For choler and melancholy (according 
to Reolanus) are drie humours; humours because of 
their liquid consistence, and drie because they have the 
naturall force of drying. The humours are the first begotten 
matter, out of the mixture of the four elements; 
choler of fire; phlegme of water; melancholy of the 
earth; bloud of the aire; for it is hot and moist, as the 
aire. An humour is either elementary, alimentary, or 
excrementitious: elementary, is the purest parts of the 
seed; alimentary, is that which is generated of the nourishment 
in the body, by the native heat, and mixed in 
the veines by the name of bloud; but not only bloud, for 
it hath a mixture of the three other humours although 
the greatest part be bloud, and of these are produced the 
second humours, inominata, or without name, ros dew, 
gluten, which is ros condensed, and cambion: excrementitious, 
which is either profitable, and necessary, as choler 
in the gall, melancholy in the spleen, spittle in the 
jawes, and milke in the dugs; or unprofitable as urine, 
[^p.22^] 
sweate, excrement of the nose, and menstruous blood. 
 
The alimentary Humour (as I have said) which is fit 
to nourish the body, is that humour which is contained 
in the veines, and arteries of a man, who is temperate, 
and perfectly well in health, and is knowne by the generall 
name of Blood, which is let out at the opening of a 
veine, though it be in divers parts of the body unlike, 
and different, for the thicke blood which is in the bottome, 
is not an humour, but is melancholy blood; the 
light froth that swimmes on the top is not Choller, but 
cholericke blood, unlesse it be changed by nature into 
choller, and melancholy, which often it is, and from 
the blood is knowne, because being out of its vessels, it 
will congeale, but the humour never at all; for blood 
otherwise taken is an humour of a certaine kinde, destinguished 
by heat, and warmth, from the other humours 
comprehended with it in the whole masse of the blood. 
 
Blood in complexion is hot, and moist, rather temperate, 
in colour Red, Rosie, or Crimson; in smell, 
not stinking, in taste savoury, of indifferent consistence, 
neither too thicke, nor too thinne, and is of the nature 
of three signes of the Aire, Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, 
and hath its originall in the very first minute of our 
creation, and is encreased by the meate we eat, being 
drawne into the bottome of the ventricle, and there detained 
untill by force of concoction it is turned into a 
thicke substance of colour according to the meate we 
eat, much like in consistence to almond butter, and 
this is called the Chylus which is formed round, that it 
may be the better sucked out, for were it like a trough, 
that which was before concocted would be over much, 
whiles the other is sucked out. This Chylus seeming 
[^p.23^] 
one, and the same thing in its selfe, yet consists of parts of 
a different nature, either by reason of the variety of 
meats, or by one, and the selfe same meate; this being 
perfectly concocted, is received by the vena porta, or 
gate veine, and driven from thence into the small guts, 
and sucked in by the meseraick veines, & so enters the liver, 
where (as some have thought) it gets no tincture, or 
rudiment, but it (being before coloured) gives colour to 
the liver, which otherwise is a thing of another kinde, 
and of a farre different colour, and from thence it enters 
the heart, where it is perfected; for they are much deceived, 
who imagine the blood to have its originall in 
the liver, for in Embrioes you may see the heart, and all 
the vessels made before they live, and an Egge in foure 
and twenty houres will be blood, and then a Chicken; 
so the bloud is the first that is made; and of this masse 
of blood are all the other humours made at one, and the 
same time: The blood being thus composed is devided 
into two parts, naturall, and unnaturall. Naturall which 
I have already shewed you is either arteriall contained in 
the arteries, or venall, contained in the veines, the arteriall 
is more red, cleare, subtle, hot, and flowing from an 
opened artery in a violent maner: the venall beats not, & 
is lesse red then the other, darker of colour, thick, & not 
so hot. Vnnaturall is in quality by infection, or commixtion 
with an humour, it is unnatural in quality, when it is 
changed from its good complexion, & is either too hot, 
or too cold, too thicke, or too thinne, or more subtle 
then it should be; by infection when that some part of 
the bloud is evidently infected, and putrified by commixture 
with another humour; that is, when there is 
more of another humour then ought to be, either outwardly 
[^p.24^] 
when the evill humour encreases outwardly on 
the bloud, or inward when an evill humour generated 
within the bloud is absolutly mingled with it; as when 
some part of the bloud being putrified, and its subtle 
parts turned into choller, and the grosse parts turned into 
melancholy, and that choller, or melancholy become 
adust, and remaine with the bloud, it infects and putrifies 
it: and thus it is alienated from the naturall, either in substance, 
color, smel, or tast; in substance because it is thicker, 
and more troubled, as when there is mingled with it 
blacke choller, or subtler by the commixture of yellow 
watry choller; in colour, by either declining to white by 
the mixture of phlegme, or to blacknes by the mixture 
of melancholy: by smell, by being of a worse savour, 
by the admixture of rotten humours, or by altogether 
wanting savour by the mixture of raw humors; in tast 
by turning either into bitternesse, by mixture of choller, 
or to sharpnesse by mixture, of melancholy, or to unsavorinesse 
by the mixture of phlegme. And to conclude, 
bloud is (no question) the first amongst other humors, 
towards the beginning, and sustaining of mans life; towards 
the beginning, as thus; the seed is nothing else 
but bloud made white by the more powerfull concoction 
in the testicles, and of bloud is generated the material 
cause of marrow; for it is not to be doubted, but all the 
parts of our body are more nourished thereby, then by 
any other humour, which will appeare by this example; 
the ventricle of a child nourished in the womb, not by 
any Chilus, for there is none, but by the mothers bloud 
which the liver drawes by the veines of the navell. 
 
Blood is the matter containing the spirits, of which 
the life, and every operation of the vegetative vertue 
[^p.25^] 
consists, whether vitall, or animall, and it may very well 
challenge to its selfe the principall place being farre 
more convenient then any of the other humours towards 
the maintaining of life, by reason of its heate, 
and moisture, and because it more nourishes the body, 
and more weakens it by its losse; for it is the treasure of 
life through the losse whereof followes death immediately. 
 
Those in whom this humour abounds are beautified 
with a fresh and rosie colour, gentle and well natured, 
pleasant merry, and facetious; it is best generated in the 
spring, and accordingly in youth, that is to say, from 
the five and twentieth yeare to the thirtieth yeare of 
age. 
 
The blood thus brought to the liver as before, must 
of necessity be purged from his too excrementitious 
humours, whereof the bladder of the gale drawes one, 
which we call yellow choller, and the spleene the 
other which we call melancholy; which are naturall 
and excrementitious, but not alimentary, or nourishing; 
but we will leave these for a while, and speake of 
phlegme, which hath the next place to blood, because 
it is neerer the radicall moisture. 
 
[/34./] 
Phlegme is twofold, naturall and unnaturall: Naturall 
as it is cold and moist, white and sweet, by an imperfect 
concoction in the second digestion, taking its originall 
from the watry, and crude parts of the Chylus, 
and is meerely blood perfectly concocted, having neither 
the colour nor the aptnesse to nourish fleshy members 
that blood hath; so that that part of the Chylus 
that hath suffered any digestion in the liver, while the 
blood is perfected, and remaines white, savory, and 
[^p.26^] 
watry, and of a remisse colour, is called phlegme which 
hath no proper receptacle as the other humours have 
but runnes along with the bloud, that in time of necessity 
it may likewise be made bloud, or at least may supply 
its defect; but it hath an improper receptacle which is 
the stomach whether it often gathers, and the lungs on 
which it sometimes falles. 
 
[/35./] 
The unnaturall is either changed in its quality, or in 
its quantity by being mixed with other humours; for 
there must be a substance in all, a just quality, and quantity; 
to the substance belongs the consistence; to the quantity 
belongs proportion; and to the quality appertaines 
savour, and colour: choller (for example) must be thin, 
malancholy thicke, pituit or phlegme in a meane almost 
like bloud: choller in his first qualities ought to be 
hot and dry; in his second qualities bitter and yellow: 
phleghme in its first qualities ought to be cold and 
moist, in the second white and unsavorie, for it is made 
sweete before it is mingled with the bloud, and it is evident 
that sweetnesse proceeds from a moderate heate, as 
bloud, sugar, hony, and the like do shew, which are 
moderately hot; but naturall phlegme is cold, therfore 
it may better be termed unsavorie, then sweete: melancholy 
in his first qualities is cold and drie; in his second, 
black and sharp, or sower: bloud is hot and moist, if it be 
with other humors it is temperate, but in the second qualities 
it is red and sweet; in all foure there ought to be a 
proportion, of choller least, then melancholy, then of 
bloud ought to be most, then phlegme; and if this proportion 
faile, so that there be either more or lesse of 
one then ought to be, or that one of them fall from its 
right temper, it breeds the originall of almost all diseases 
[^p.27^] 
which is ill digestion. But to returne, the unnaturall 
phlegme, as I shewed you, is either changed in its quality 
or quantiy, and of these we count eight kindes (according 
to Avicen) whereof foure without the veines, 
[/36./] 
viz. Watery, that is subtill as water, and is found in the 
[/37./] 
spittings of drunken men. Secondly mucous or raw, 
wherein are some parts grosse, some subtill, but when 
the difference of the parts is so little as it cannot be perceived, 
then it is termed raw. Thirdly glassie, resembling 
[/38./] 
molten glasse, or rather the white of an egge, by 
reason of the stiffenesse and weight, and is not properly 
[/39./] 
cold, but of a kinde of faint heat. Fourthly, Gypsea 
plaister like which is concrete into the forme, and hardnesse 
of chalke, whose subtle parts are resolved as you 
see in a knotty goute in the joyntes of the fingers. The 
[/40./] 
other foure are within the veines; as first acide, or sower 
which hath had none, or very little impression of 
[/41./] 
heate more then that it first had in the stomach. Secondly, 
salt or adust which is bred by the mixture of choler, 
whose bitternesse is lost by the unsavorinesse of 
phlegme. Thirdly, thicke and grosse of sower phlegme 
[/42./] 
by reason of the vehement cold. Fourthly, stipticke 
[/43./] 
that is not so cold, nor grosse as the other. 
 
Phlegme is of the nature of the three signes of the 
water, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, and is watry cold and 
moist, of consistence liquid; of colour white; of taste, 
sweete, or rather unsavory, fit to nourish the braine, 
and all other cold, and moist parts, to make the bloud 
temperate, and to yeild moistnesse to the joynts: It is 
placed in the body either of necessity, or for profit; of 
necessity two waies, whereof the first is common: the 
second particular: The common is that phlegme which 
[^p.28^] 
is neerest the members, and by which they are nourished 
when as any time they shall have lost their proper 
nourishment good blood; neither doth it nourish, but 
when it is sent into the bloody veines by the liver; the 
particular, is the mingling of it with the blood, tempring 
it and making it fit to nourish the phlegmaticke 
parts, as the braine and nerves: for to nourish these a 
great part or portion of phlegme is required: for profit 
likewise two waies, whereof the first is likewise 
common, the other particular; the common whereby it 
makes the blood the more thinne, flowing, and penetrating, 
the easier to slide through the veines into the 
members; the particular, that it may moisten the joynts 
and members that are most moved in the body, least by 
continuall motion they become dry, because every locall 
motion is a straining and heating, end every heate is 
resolutive and desiccative; therefore that the joynts of 
the bones by continuall motion, which is made by the 
sinewes and muscles, should not be over heat, dried, 
and consequently made quite unfit for the naturall use 
and motion; nature hath ordained these phlegmaticke 
humours, which as it were distilling out of the veines, 
doe water and moisten them; not unlike the oyling 
the Axel-tree of a Coach, without which it would (as 
we see by daily experience) be burned into dust; but 
this office of this humour is not profitable nor necessary 
for every one, for infantes, and weake impotent people, 
that can neither walke nor worke, but sit idle, doe 
not need this moisture; but those that labour hard, and go 
much, have extraordinary need of it. 
 
Phlegme maketh a man drowsie, dull, fat, and swollen, 
and hastneth gray haires; it abounds most in Winter, 
[^p.29^] 
and in those that incline to old age; and is encreased 
by cold, and crude nourishment. 
 
[/44./] 
The next is Choller, which is an humour hot and 
dry, of thinne, and subtle substance, and is, as it were, 
a certaine heate, and fury of humours, which generated 
in the liver, together with the blood is carried by the 
veines and arteries through the whole body; that of it 
which abounds is sent partly into the guts, and partly 
into the bladder of the gall (which is its proper receptacle, 
and is in the hollownesse of the liver) or is consumed 
by transpiration and sweats: Choller is devided 
[/45./] 
into two parts, naturall, and unnaturall: The Naturall 
is, as it were, the froth of the blood, whose colour is 
of a cleare red turning towards yellow, and hath its 
originall from the more subtill parts of the Chylus. 
[/46./] 
Unnaturall is by infection and commixtion of another 
humour, or by alteration; and it is called unnaturall 
when it is either greene, blacke, or darke red of colour: 
that kinde of unnaturall Choller which is made by mixture 
[/47./] 
with another humour is called Vittelline, because in 
heate and consistence it is like the yolkes of egges; and 
this Avicen thinkes to be made of thicke phlegme 
mingled with choller; but Gallen thinkes it to be only 
by alteration, and a stronger heate destroying the moisture; 
for any humour deprived of its moisture, must 
needs wax thicke; and this is the most received opinion; 
for choller waxes pale and cold by the mixture of 
phlegme. These other following are made only by 
[/48./] 
alteration, viz. Leeke coloured, or resembling the 
juice of a leek in greenes, tending towards black, which 
is generated in the ventricle by the crudity of meats, and 
[/49./] 
therefore is sometimes called greene phlegme: Æruginous 
[^p.30^] 
of the collour of Verdigreace tending towards 
white; for according to Avicen, it is made of the aforesaid 
greene being more adust by the ventricle or liver 
inflamed, as bones being burned are first blacke, and afterwards 
turne white it is so hot and biting that it burnes 
like to hot poison. To these we may adde blew choller 
[/50./] 
much like in colour to the herbe Woad that our dyers 
[/51./] 
use; and to this also belongs that which is called Skie-coloured, 
or Sea-coloured, and is the worst of all the humours, 
except blacke choller, for it gets so much acrimony 
by reason of the heat, that it corrodes, and ulcerates; 
this kinde is generated in the ventricle, or neare 
[/52./] 
about it: Red choller is improperly called Red, being 
rather blood; only this is the difference, blood congeales 
when it is out of its vessels, but red choller will 
not: it is made red by being mingled with some bloudy 
moisture; and it is made pale almost to the likenesse of 
[/53./] 
naturall choller, by the mixture of phlegme. Blacke 
choller so much degenerates from the naturall, as that 
it acquires the name of another humour, which is properly 
called melancholy, of which we will speake in 
his place. You shall understand, that that part of naturall 
choller that goeth with the blood through the 
veines, is sent thither for two speciall reasons, which 
we may call necessity and profit; of necessity, because 
it is requisit and needfull that the cholericke members 
be nourished by it, whereto a great part of choller is 
required: Secondly, for profit, that it may subtle the 
blood in the veines, and make itth more penetrating in 
its passage. 
 
Another part of naturall choller is seperated from 
the masse of humours generated in the liver, and is sent 
[^p.31^] 
to the bladder of the gall, of necessity, and for profit: 
of necessity, that the whole body may be purged, cleansed 
and mundified from cholericke superfluities; for 
the gall either by its owne property, or by the naturall 
attractive vertue, doeth draw unto it choler, as a thing 
most fit and proper for it self, even after the maner of 
the Loadstones drawing of iron; which kind of delight 
in attracting; is established in a certaine hidden sympathy, 
which nature hath ordained betweene choler, and 
the bladder of the gall; by whose attraction the whole 
body, and likewise the bloud is cleansed and mundified 
from all superfluous choler, which otherwise might impaire 
the health: secondly for profit; first that it may 
wash the intestines from dregs, and viscous phlegm; secondly 
to pricke and sting the guts, and muskles of the 
belly, that they may feele that it is hurtfull for them, 
and therefore may endevour to expell it; for the expulsive 
faculty doth not exercise it selfe in expelling the 
dregs remaining in the belly and guttes, unles it be excited 
by choler flowing thereunto, whereby it often happens 
that the passages betweene the gall and the guts 
being stopped, the colicke ensues. 
 
Choler is chiefly bred, and expelled in youth; and acride, 
and bitter meats yeeld matter to it, but great labours 
of body and mind give the occasion. It maketh a 
man nimble, quicke, ready for any performance, leane, 
and much subject to anger, and quicke of concoction. 
 
Choler is of the nature of the three signes of the fire, 
Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, and is fiery hot and drie; of 
consistence thin; of colour yellow, or pale; of taste bitter: 
it provoketh the expulsive faculty of the guts, and attenuates 
the phlegme cleaving to them; but the alimentary 
[^p.32^] 
is fit to nourish the partes of like temper with it. 
 
[/54./] 
Melancholy or the melancholy humour being the 
grosser portion, and as it were the mud and dregges 
of the bloud, is partly sent from the liver to the spleene 
to nourish it, and partly carried by the vessels into the 
rest of the body, and spent in the nourishment of the 
parts endewed with an earthly drynesse; it is an enemy 
to mirth and jollity, and neere kinsman to death; and is 
[/55./] 
by the ancients devided into two parts as phlegme is, 
that is naturall, and unnaturall; the naturall is cold and 
drie, and is generated in the Chilus passing as aforesaid. 
 
The unnatural is not like the dregs of blod, but it is like 
[/56./] 
the lees of wine burnt, hotter & lighter then naturall melancholy 
is, and taks its originall from any of the humors 
adust; as from choller adust turned into melancholy, 
which only amongst all the humours reserves its owne 
proper tast, that is bitter; from phlegme adust, which 
phlegme if it be watery and very subtle, then the melancholy 
thereof generated will be salt; which if it be 
not salt, then the melancholy will be acide, and sharpe; 
from bloud adust, and this kind of melancholy is salt 
having also some little sweetnesse; for bloud is the 
treasure of nature, and most diligently preserved by the 
other humours, whereby it seldome happens that it is 
wholy, and totally adust, because it retaines some sweetnes 
from naturall melancholy adust, from whence it 
happens that if the naturall melancholy from whence 
this unnaturall melancholy proceeds be subtle then 
this melancholy arising from the adustion will be even 
as sharp as vineger, and being cast on the ground turnes 
into bubbles; and this is the worst of all the kindes of 
[^p.33^] 
[/57./] 
melancholies, and is called atra bilis; for it not only 
corrodes the parts whereinto it is gathered, but wheresoever 
it touches it burnes and scaldes, as powerfully as 
Lime, Ashes, or burnt Lees of Wine, wherein some 
reliques of fire remaine; hereby it happens that a disentery 
caused by this humour is deadly, because it ulcerates 
the intestines; now blood adust, melancholy humours, 
and atra bilis may easily be distinguished; for 
from blood adust arise carbuncles; from melancholy 
schirrous tumours; and from atra bilis is generated cancer; 
and of this last the smell is so contagious, that the 
very flies doe shunne it; but if that naturall melancholy 
be grosse, then that which proceeds from it by adustion 
will be of farre lesse sharpnesse. 
 
A part likewise of naturall melancholy passeth along 
with the blood, of necessity, and for profit; of necessity 
that it may be mingled with the blood in that quantity, 
and proportion as is necessary and requisite to nourish 
some members, which are maintained by a great portion 
of melancholy, as the bones, and other cold, and dry 
melancholy members: Secondly for profit that it may 
attenuate the grossenesse of the blood, and strengthen, 
and consolidate it untill it becomes a solid part of such 
hard members as it ought to nourish. 
 
A part of naturall melancholy is also sent unto the 
spleene, the blood having no need thereof, which is 
done for the aforesaid causes. The first is universall, for 
it is very necessary the whole body should be purged of 
superfluous melancholy; and also particular, because it 
ought to nourish a particular member, that is the spleen. 
The second is of the melancholy that flowes to the orifice 
of the stomacke, and by his stipticity straining, 
[^p.34^] 
and as it were milking out the moisture it there findes, 
as a woman straines and presses out the milke from the 
Cowes teates with her fingers, and this profit arises two 
severall waies; first when melancholy bindes, unites, 
and strengthens the orifice of the stomacke that the 
meate may be the better retained therein; secondly 
where such melancholy by his acridnesse makes a kinde 
of commotion in the mouth of the stomacke, whereby 
the desire of meate is excited and stirred: for after the 
mouth of the stomacke is thus moved, a kinde of griping 
followes (as saith Iames de Forlivio) which presently 
the sensitive faculty perceiving is excited to the desire 
of meate, whereby that griping is ended 
 
Melancholy is made of meates of grosse juice, and by 
the perturbations of the minde turned into feare and 
sadnesse: it is augmented in the first, and crude old age; 
it makes men sad, harsh, constant, froward, envious, 
and fearefull; it is of the nature of the three signes of 
the earth, Taurus, Capricorne, and Virgo, and is of nature 
earthly cold and dry; of consistence grosse, and muddy; 
of colour blackish; of taste acide, sower, and biting; 
stirres up the appetite, nourishes the spleene, and all the 
parts of like temper to it, as the bones, &c. 
 
Neither is it to be doubted but that these humours 
doe move, and rule at certaine set houres of the day and 
night, as by a certaine peculiar motion or tide; for the 
blood flowes from the ninth houre of the night to the 
third houre of the day, as in the spring time: Choler to 
the ninth of the day, as in summer: Melancholy to the 
third of the night, as in autumne; the rest of the night 
that remaines is under the dominion of phlegme, as in 
winter, whereof manifest examples appeare in the 
[^p.35^] 
French Pox, &c. And these things thus understood, 
you may know what humour raigneth in the sicke, and 
at what time he shall be most grieved. Next I shall shew 
[/58./] 
you what the second humours are which as I told you 
are likewise foure. 
 
[/59./] 
The first whereof is called the humour without a 
name, as having no proper name, but is thought to be 
a kinde of bloody moisture which hanges ready to fall 
in little droppes at the orifice of the small capillary 
veines; for in the body are certaine great veines which 
like the trunke of a tree doe spread forth their branches 
to the finenesse of haires, in which (according to Iohannitius) 
are scituate the humours, which after the third 
concoction are turned into moisture, which is called in 
latine inominata, because it wants a proper name whereby 
to call it, or else because it participates with the first 
and second humours; and after certaine spongious or 
porous parts beginnes the orifice of the veines like the 
mouthes of small wormes, which whiles the digestion 
is perfecting are shut (as the matrice is after conception) 
but (digestion finished) they open naturally (as the matrice 
opens when the child is ready to be borne) through 
which thus opened distills this aforesaid bloody moisture 
which entring the members agreeable is apropriate 
unto them, as the first operation of the nutritive 
vertue. 
 
[/60./] 
The second is called Ros dew, which moistens the 
part into whose substance it is already fallen; it is begot 
of the other humours, and serves very aptly for to nourish, 
when the body wants nourishment, as to moisten 
members that are overdryed, either by too much care 
or over much frequenting the fire, or remaining under a 
[^p.36^] 
hot climate, as the Æthiopians, &c. This moisture is 
properly called Ros from the likenesse it hath to dew, 
because as dew falleth upon the earth, moistneth it, and 
administers nourishment to the plants, so this moisture 
doth at times of necessity, yield nourishment to the desiring 
member; but not true substantiall nourishment, 
because it hath not in it selfe solid substance sufficient to 
be made part of a member; but it is in a kinde of imperfect 
way, which is called a refreshing: Further seeing 
that this moisture is partly watry, partly airy and fat, 
therefore when it waters the members being by a continuall 
resolution dry, the easier is that joyned to the 
members which they call Cambium, then if they had 
still remained dry, for moist to moist makes an union. 
 
[/61./] 
The third is called Cambium, which put into the part 
that is to be nourished is there fastened, being more 
thickned then the other two in the holes of the aforesaid 
little veines, and is a substance truely nourishing, 
because it is converted into the substance of the members, 
according to complexion; but yet not according 
to the compleate essentiall parts, and full likenesse, 
which we call substantiall forme; for it is the object of 
the fourth digestion, about which the vertue nutritive 
exercises its selfe, which is properly termed the last vertue 
digestive, and of which arise three operations: First, 
the adding of the Cambium to the members: Secondly 
the uniting, or fastning thereof: Thirdly the assimulating, 
or bringing into forme: therefore while this Cambium 
generated of pure meats is added to the members, 
it is conformable to them in complexion, neither heating, 
nor cooling, nor moistning, nor drying the substance 
of the members qualitatively as a distemperate 
[^p.37^] 
medicine; but in substance and essentiall forme, and similitude, 
it is not yet assimulated to the members; yea the 
vertue nutritive a little working it, and striving as it 
were to assimulate it, doth thicken, and consolidate its 
substance, that it may make it like the substance of the 
members. 
 
[/62./] 
The fourth is called Gluten, Glew, which is only the 
proper and substance-making humidity of the simular 
parts, not their substance; and the first roote and begining 
of it is in the sperme or seed, as the beginning of 
the seed is from the humours; neither is it as I said a 
substantiall part of the members, but a part of the part, 
as elements constituting simple members, as it appeares 
by the composition of the body; for this is compounded 
of foure severall things, hot qualified by cold, and 
moisture diminished by drines; but yet none of these 
serve towards the composition of a soule, neither are 
they any integrall or substantiall parts of the body of 
any one living.
