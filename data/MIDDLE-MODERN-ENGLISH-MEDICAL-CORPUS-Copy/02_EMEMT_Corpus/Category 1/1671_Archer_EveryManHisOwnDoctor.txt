[}CHAP. 1. 
Of the preservation of 
Health.}] 
 
TO preserve health when present and 
to Restore if lost is the chief end of 
Phisick and shall be my Main design in this 
small tract. The word Medicina being 
derived amedendo that is healing such as are 
sick doth properly belong to the Theraputicall 
part only, which part being most 
necessary was first invented yet afterwards 
when that part was added which shews the 
preservation of present health the same denomination 
was still retained and is now 
[^p.2^] 
given to the whole art of Phisick, therefore 
for definition Phisick is an art of preserving 
mans health when present and restoreing 
it when lost as far as it is posible. 
 
The subject of Phisick is mans body as it 
is obnoxious to diseases, the scope or end 
of Phisick is to heal --- although it is impossible 
to cure all that are sick; yet the 
Physitian hath performed his office if he 
hath omitted none of those things that are 
in the power of nature and art. 
 
Health amongst all things called good by 
Mortals is most desired when sick, therefore 
ought to be highly prized, when in 
well being, and I think it may not only be 
acceptable, but very profitable to all, to be 
sincerely and briefly informed how to keep 
health and cure themselves; Especially for 
those that have not patience to read voluminous 
Authours, and those that want time 
and means for due Regulation and Government; 
although we have an old Proverb, 
that every Man is a Fool, or a Physitian 
at forty year old. Which saying is 
very true, my meaning is, that every Man 
in prudence should so far be his own 
Doctor as rightly to know his own Constitution 
and Complection, and the reasons 
[^p.3^] 
for the Friendly agreement or the Antipathy 
of any Food to his own body, and for 
this end he ought to know the Nature of all 
Meat and Drink in use as ordinary Food 
(amongst us in England especially.) 
 
The aforesaid knowledge is the Hygenial 
part of Physick, that is Rules how present 
health may be preserved, and how to beware 
not to fall into a Disease, not that I 
think it necessary that every particular Person 
should be able to read an Anotomy 
Lecture upon the parts of his own Body, 
nor study the Nature, differences, causes of 
Diseases, nor the various sorts, nor qualities 
of Purgative Medicines, but that 
Man is to be pittied that eats for hunger and 
knows not the Nature of what he Eats, 
which negligence in so necessary a knowledge 
hath occasioned much Sickness to 
many, and Death not to few. For preventing 
of such dangers, you shall now receive 
brief Rules how to know your own 
Constitution and Complection, and also 
the Nature and Faculty of all the Meat, 
Drink, or sorts of Food, now used in this 
Kingdom. To the end that every Man may 
be his own Doctor, so far as to know as 
well by reason as experience, that this doth 
[^p.4^] 
agree with my Constitution, and why that 
doth not. 
 
Now first I understand the temperature of 
a sound Man, and that of all living Creatures 
man is most temperate, so that all living 
Creatures, and Food and Medicines 
compared to man are said to be hotter, 
Colder, moister, or dryer, though man be 
not absolutely temperate for common 
sense tells us that heat in man is predominant 
over the other qualities. 
 
[}CHAP. II. 
Shews the best Temperature.}] 
 
THe best temperature for a man to perform 
his actions, is hot and moist, for 
our lives consist of heat and moisture, and 
the contrary Coldness and Dryness leads 
us to Death, and by how much sooner a 
man is cooled and dryed, by so much sooner 
a man grows old and dyes, yet that heat 
and moisture have their degrees, for if the 
[^p.5^] 
heat exceed the cold, the moisture, the 
drowth, moderately that temper is best 
and accounted temperate, and all others 
differing from this, are called either hot 
and moist, hot and dry, cold and moist, cold 
and dry, though all in general are hot and 
moist, these Temperaments are commonly 
explained by these differing Names. of 
Sanguine, Cholerick, Plegmatick and Melancholly, 
which must be understood of the variety 
of blood, which is the Nutriment of 
the body and not of Extrementitious humours. 
Now I will give some Signs how 
and whereby you may judge your Complections 
according, to Senertus, and whether 
you differ from the best Constitution. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}CHAP. III. 
Of Signs to know your 
Constitution or Complection.}] 
 
FIrst bodies which are too hot, yet moderate 
in dryness and humidity, such 
discover themselves, to the touch Hair 
abounds in the whole body, and is inclining 
to yellow and thick, they are thinner as to 
matter of Fat, they are swift and strong for 
motion, prone to anger the colour of the 
Face is redder then of a temperate body 
they are easily hurt by hot things. 
 
[}Signs of a hot and dry Constitution, 
viz. Cholerick.}] 
 
If moisture be joyned to heat which 
they call Cholerick the body shall be hot, 
[^p.7^] 
hard, thin, and lean, hairy and the hairs are 
black curled, the pulse of the Arteries are 
great, and their veins great, they are angry 
persons, which are endued with such a temperature 
obstinate lovers of Brawlings they 
desire few things they are fit for the generation 
of males. 
 
[}Signs of a hot and moist Sanguine 
Constitution.}] 
 
If moisture be joyned to heat which 
Temperament they call Sanguine the bodies, 
shall be hot and soft abounding with much 
blood fleshy indued with large veins and 
those which are so in their youth often have 
the Hemorrhoides, or bleeding at the Nose, 
and if the humidity abound they are apt 
from their youth to Diseases of putrifaction. 
 
[}Signs of a cold Constitution.}] 
 
If the body be too cold, such a body is 
perceived by the touch and is white, fat, 
slow, soft and bald, 'tis easily hurt by cold 
things, it hath a narrow breast without hair, 
[^p.8^] 
and narrow veins, scarcely appearing, the 
hairs thin and of small increase for the most 
part, they are fearful that are of that Temperament. 
 
[}Signs of a cold and moist 
Phlegmatick Constitution.}] 
 
If moisture be joyned to the cold not 
much, nor that coldness great, the body 
shall be white in colour, fat, thick, soft, 
reddish Hair, inclining to paleness, but if 
the frigidity with the humidity be more 
intense the body shall be thick, coloured 
yellow, exceeding bald, the hair smooth, 
the veins lying hid, such Temperaments are 
dull and slow of apprehension and for the 
most part altogether idle, no ways ready, 
simple, nor prone to anger. 
 
Not that any scarcely may be said to be 
of a simple Compl_ [^ORIG. BLURRED^]ction, without mixture 
of some other, neither do any abide long 
what they are. 
 
[^p.9^] 
[}Of a cold and dry Melancholly 
Complection.}] 
 
If Frigidity be joyned to dryness, such a 
body is discerned by the touch, those shall 
be lean, bald, pale, which are of such a constitution, 
slow in motion, dejected in countenance 
with their eyes fixed, as for Melancholians 
in particular, not only whom 
the vulgar, but whom Aristotle in the thirty 
Section, and the first probleme accounts 
ingenious, wherein the said Aristotle writes 
that much and cold Choller is black, such 
are foolish and idle: Wherein there is 
much and hot Choller, those are quick-sighted 
and ingenious, apt to love, propense 
to anger and lust. 
 
Some great Bablers - but those whose 
heat is more remiss, more temperate, and 
as it were reduced to Mediocrity, those are 
more prudent, and although they less exceed 
in some matters, yet in others they are 
far better then the others, some in the study 
of Literature, others in Arts, others in 
Common-wealths; namely those Melancholians 
are ingenious, who by nature abound 
[^p.10^] 
with good and plenty of blood, 
wherewith some part thicker and dryer is 
mingled; which adds as it were strength to 
the blood, and when attenuated, and as it 
were poured it is spiritual. 
 
[}CHAP. IV. 
The Benefit to be gathered 
from knowledge of our 
own Complection.}] 
 
BY comparing what is already said to the 
present Temperament of our own bodies 
we may find a certain agreement with 
them and some of the Temperaments described 
which known and well considered it 
will prove of no small value to all that desire 
health, or Wisdom; for we say premonitus 
premunitus, if I know by the forewritten 
Signs that I am a Chollerick person, 
I will resolvedly beware the evils of 
that Temperament, both of body and mind 
[^p.11^] 
as knowing my inclination to quarrels, 
Wrath, anger, fightings, &c. I will bridle 
Nature for it is truly said. Mores sequntur 
humores, according to the humours of the 
body, so are the conditions of the mind, 
and also for Food, knowing my Temperament 
to be hot and Cholerick, I must avoid 
those things in meat and drink that increase 
it, and use things that do allay and cool 
heat. And so a Phlegmatick person ought 
to avoid cold and moist things especially, 
both in meat, and drink, therefore his drink 
may well be more strong, and Food hotter, 
and more drying then the person that 
is hot and dry already - For the person 
being hot and dry, ought to correct his heat 
with cooling and moistning, as the Melancholly 
man who is cold and dry ought to 
take Food both healing and moistning. So 
Sympathy and Antipathy must be observed 
in Physick rules for preservation of health, 
for it is truly said Contrariæ Contrariis Curantur, 
all Remedies are performed by their 
contraries. 
 
[^p.12^] 
[}CHAP. V. 
Some common Axiomes 
and Maximes, there are 
to be observed in the method 
of preserving of 
health. as,}] 
 
1. NAture doth nothing rashly. 
2. Too much of any thing is an enemy 
to Nature. 
3. Nature is the Physitian of Diseases 
but the Physitian is the servant of Nature 
and ought to imitate her she acting aright. 
4. Custome is a second Nature and 
those things which he are accustomed to a 
long time though worse they are wont to be 
less troublesome then those things we are 
not used to. 
 
[^p.13^] 
[}Doctrine of the preservation 
of health.}] 
 
DOctrine for health is comprehended in 
these 2 parts, viz. 
 
Materials of health or wholesome causes. 
2. A knowledge necessary for the preservation 
of health teaching how things called 
Non-Natural are to be used for the 
keeping men in health, they are comprehended 
under the notion of things Non-Natural, 
and ought to be ordered into four 
Ranks. as, 
 
1. First, Those things which are taken in. 
2. Secondly, Those things which are 
carried. 
3. Thirdly, Those things which are emitted 
and Retained. 
4. Fourthly, What befalls the body by 
accident. as, 
Of Air, 
Meat and Drink, 
Passion of the mind, 
Motion, and exercise of body, 
Rest, Sleep and Watching, 
Venery, excretions and Retentions. 
 
[^p.14^] 
[}CHAP. VI. 
Of Air.}] 
 
AIr is the most worthy Element for the 
preservation of Life in every creature, 
nay the other Elements subsist by it, as 
for example fire is estinguished if you keep 
Air from it, and water putrifies and stinks if 
Air comes not to it: and the very Earth 
brings forth nothing to maturity, without 
it. 
 
Therefore we may well give precedency 
to its worth in discourse. The Air affects 
our bodies two wayes, viz. Extrinsecally 
as it insinuates through the pores of the skin 
and as it is attracted by inspiration, so it 
hath a force upon our bodies and impresseth 
its quality whether good or bad upon us, 
according to all writers. 
 
[^p.15^] 
[}The best air.}] 
 
The best Air is temperate as to the primary 
quallities, and is pure and infected, 
with no pollutions but is Serene, moved or 
stirred with the Winds, breathing sweetly 
with pleasant Gales and sometimes moistned 
with wholesome showers. 
 
[}Corrupt air.}] 
 
On the contrary that Air is vitious which 
is infected with exhalations and vitious 
vapours breaking forth on every side, or is 
compassed with marish or standing waters 
after what manner soever it be impure, and 
such as cannot be purified by the blowing 
of Winds, that Air which is troubled, or 
too Hot, or too Cold, too Dry, or too 
moist. 
 
[}Constitution of air.}] 
 
But the Constitution of Air may be polluted 
[^p.16^] 
though divers causes, first the Constitution 
of the Air depends on the Air depends on the scituation 
and nature of places for some Regions 
are hotter then others, others colder, for 
by how much the more any Regions receive 
the direct beams of the Sun; and by how 
much the longer the Sun remains above 
their Horizon, by so much the Country is 
more hot, the contrary Reasons make it 
so much the Colder, yet this cause only 
doth not suffice, neither is the same Constitution 
of Air in all the inhabitants under 
the same Latitude for these ten Reasons. 
First the mold and proper Nature of the 
Earth conduceth to the Constitution and 
Temperature of the air, wherein is to be 
observed what the Nature of Ground is, 
whether Fat, Dirty, Filthy, Gravelly, Stony, 
Sandy. 
 
Whether the place be high, or low, 
what scituation there is of Mountains and 
Valleys, what Winds it often admits, and 
from what Climates, whether the Sea or 
any Lakes be near it, whether it brings 
forth mettals from whence malignant air 
may be exhaled. 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}2. Scituation of Mountains.}] 
 
The Mountains also change the Constitution 
of the air, according as the blowing 
of certain winds drive away and admit it, 
and if the Mountains drive away the North 
wind, but admit the South wind, it comes 
to pass that the air is hotter and moister, 
the contrary makes the place colder and 
dryer. 
 
[}3. Winds.}] 
 
The different winds bring forth great 
Mutations, as the Oriental or East winds 
are more temperate, also the Occidental 
or West, but these are moister, the 
Northern are cold and dry, and have power 
to bind bodies and dry them, the 
Southern are hot and moist, therefore as 
the Region or Scituation is more or less 
disposed to this or that wind, so it obtains 
this or that Constitution of air, but 
generaly Countrys exposed to the Oriental 
[^p.18^] 
Sun are more wholesome then those 
which are exposed to the Septentrional or 
North winds, and hot winds are more 
wholesome then those which are exposed 
to the West. 
 
[}4. Sea and Lakes}] 
 
The Vicinity to the Sea and Lakes conduce 
much to the peculiar Nature of the 
air, unless interjected Mountains prohibit, 
for from moist places of this Nature 
many exhalations are drawn up, which 
mingle themselves with air and moisten it, 
and indeed the humidity will be increased 
if the Sea or Lake be scituated on the South, 
but if towards the North frigidity. 
 
[}5. Metallick Pits or 
Mines.}] 
 
Mines generally communicate their 
malignant smell and vapours to the 
neighbouring places, also Caves exhale 
venemous air, also Woods that are too 
[^p.19^] 
thick hinder the light of the Sun and Moon, 
as also the motion of the air. 
 
[}6. Times of the Year.}] 
 
Indeed the seasons of the Yeer change 
the air, which Astronomers constitute equall 
according to the motion of the Sun, 
and Zodiack, being divided into four parts 
but Physitians regard these times according 
to the temper of the air, and call that 
the Spring, when the constitution of the 
air is more temperate, when we grow neither 
stiff with cold nor sweat with heat: 
but the Summer when the same is hot and 
dry, Winter when it is cold and moist, 
neither do they appoint these seasons to be 
equal in all Countries. 
 
[}7. The Spring.}] 
 
The Spring being the most temperate, 
or as Hypocrates calls it hot and moist, that 
is when calidity mode rately overcomes frigidity, 
and humidity moderately exceeds 
[^p.20^] 
driness, it is the most wholesome time of 
the Year, and although diseases are generated 
(or rather shews themselves) in the 
spring time, yet the spring of its self doth 
not produce them, but the vitious humors 
which are gathered together in the Winter 
time are driven out in the spring by the 
heat of the Sun, and Planets. 
 
[}8. The Summer}] 
 
This quarter is hot and dry, ergo makes 
bodies more hot and dry, purifies and disolves 
and renders them weaker, by reason 
of heat, it attenuates humours and 
kindles them, from whence Cholorick and 
Acrimonius humors are accumulated. 
 
[}9. Autmne.}] 
 
This Season is mixed with cold and 
heat, that is mornings and evenings are 
cold, the midle part of the day hot, its 
[^p.21^] 
Constitution is hot and cold, and by Reason 
of its inequality in Air it is very obnoxious 
to Diseases, and blood at this time 
of the Year is diminished by Reason of 
approach of cold Winter makes it dangerous 
to Phlebotomise but upon necessity, for 
now Melancholly abound bodyes are 
thickned by the Retiring of Blood and Spirits 
which causeth the pores to close. 
 
[}10. Winter.}] 
 
Now the Frigidity of the Air wih moisture 
makes Flegm abounds and procures 
Catarrhs, Distillations, Rotten Coughs. But 
if the Seasons of the Year ate variable and 
uncertain it makes the Air corrupt, by 
which means divers Diseases are Reigning 
according to the various Constitution of 
the different seasons. 
 
[}The most healthful air and 
place.}] 
 
From what we have said it is evident 
that those places, dwellings, Countries 
[^p.22^] 
and Region are most wholesome, where the 
Air is temperate, the Spring temperate, 
the heat of Summer sufficient to ripen 
Corn, and Fruit, Autumn Colder, Winter 
Cold, yet not offending out bodies with 
extreams, also a Fruitful Soil, men comely 
of Body, well coloured in the Face, 
Laudable in their manners, and joyful in 
their prosperous health, &c. ingenious in 
invention, to all which may be added valour, 
which not only is seen in Men in 
England, but as well in other Creatures 
here, as the Mastiff Dog, and cock, for which 
no part of the world can parallel, being 
no small argument of the excellent Temperature 
of the Air of England, for by experience 
their valour declines in a few 
years, being transported to other Countries. 
 
[^p.23^] 
[}CHAP. VII. 
Of Meat, or Food.}] 
 
HAving now finished our discourse of 
Air, and though we choose to live in 
the best, it is not sufficient wihtout good 
Food, therefore having already shewed 
how all may know their own Constitutions, 
and Complections, and goodness of Air, it 
will be necessary in the next place, to shew 
the nature, temper, and vertue of most 
Food is now used in this Kingdom, whereby 
every man may easily see and know by 
comparing it with his Constitution what is 
Friendly and healthful to him, and wherein 
it is inimical, and therefore know that 
all Aliment as Meat, and Drink, wherewith 
the substance of our bodies is renewed 
and strengthned, is of vertue to encrease 
the substance of our bodies, for it is a true 
[^p.24^] 
saying in a sense, that we our selves have 
had our selves upon our trenchers. 
 
Food properly so called is to nourish 
our bodies if Medicinal to alter our bodies. 
But Food is taken from two things, viz. 
From the animal Kingdom, or Vegitable, 
all those things that proceed from living 
creatures are either parts of animals, or 
those things which proceed from them as 
Eggs, Milk, Honey, Butter, Cheese, 
&c. 
 
[}Difference of Food.}] 
 
Many things there are for the Aliment 
and Food of man, and great is the difference 
of them in Nourishment, for some are very 
good and some of ill nourishment, and 
Juice, some are of easie concoction, others 
hard to be concocted again, some will corrupt 
easily in the Stomack, other some 
not. 
 
[^p.25^] 
[}The best Food.}] 
 
The best meat yeild plenty of nourishment, 
is easie of concoction, not quickly 
corrupted, not hath an ill quality and there 
remains after it, but few excrements. 
 
But the contrary are unwholesome and 
all that leaves an ill Juice and are easily 
corrupted is the worst. 
 
[}Firm Food,}] 
 
That Aliment which brings forth much 
nourishment is accounted firm, but it requires 
much strength of heat for concoction. 
But that is in firm which is easily concocted 
and nourisheth, but affords but little nourishment, 
and such that is soon dispersed 
and after it the Stomack soon calleth for 
more. 
 
[^p.26^] 
[}CHAP. IV. 
Of the Nature of every Food 
we Eat.}] 
 
ANd because I know that people of all 
qualities do commonly Feed upon 
what comes to Table, be it what it will, 
without considering the Nature or qualities 
of any thing, or agreement, or disagreement 
to their Constitutions, so it do 
but please the pallat, by which means divers 
have and do dig their Graves with their 
Teeth, to prevent which I think very necessary 
that every one should understand the 
Nature and property of his daily Food as 
well as his own Constitution, and so by 
doing himself right, he is truly become his 
own Doctor, which is the thing I aim at 
[^p.27^] 
for the benefit of all good people, for without 
doubt, daily experience upon a Mans 
own body by help of sensation may soon 
make him (if observant to these small 
Rules the wisest Doctor living in a Diatetical 
way to himself, and so by preventing 
of Diseases, he may not need so frequent 
use of Physick, which many are forced 
to. 
 
But to detain you no longer, I will first 
begin with Flesh Meat, and after to Vegetables, 
&c. And for your first dish, and 
generally approved. 
 
[}Beef.}] 
 
Beef the best of which is English bred 
and fed, but there is great difference in 
this sort of meat, as well as others, it is 
hard of concoction, thick, flesh, it doth not 
easily pass through the Veins, it doth not 
participate of viscidity or slymyness, the 
frequent use thereof causeth dry and melancholly 
humours, without exercise and 
labour of body, especially if it be old Cow 
Beef, or Oxe Beef, that with labour and 
much working hath contracted dryness and 
[^p.28^] 
hardness of Flesh or is hardned with Salt 
and Smoak. But above all meats it is most 
profitable for laborious people being not 
easily passed away, and gives much strength 
where it is concocted by labor. 
 
[}Veal.}] 
 
Veal is temperate and tender, though 
something Waterish, if thoroughly Roasted, 
affords good Juyce, of a pleasant taste, 
and yeilds a thicker Juyce then Lamb, or 
Mutton. 
 
[}Mutton.}] 
 
The beff Mutton is Weather the younger 
is the best meat, and is easily concocted 
and generates good blood, and agrees both 
with those that are well and also with those 
that are sick. -- But Ewe mutton is evil both 
by default of the temperature and by frequenting 
of Copulation and bringing forth 
young, therefore the Flesh of Ewes is evil 
[^p.29^] 
and dull and viscid juice is bred thereof. 
 
[}Lamb.}] 
 
A Lamb before it be a yeer old hath 
moist flesh, slimy and viscid, but when it is 
a year old, it is very good nourishment, 
consisting of good and plentifull juice, and 
indifferent lasting, and easie of concoction, 
but with those that are exercised with 
strong labor it is easie discussed, and not very 
solid Aliment is made thereby. 
 
[}Bacon or Pork.}] 
 
Swines flesh nourisheth very plentilully 
and yields firm nutriment, and therefore 
is most profitable for those that are in their 
flourishing age, sound and strong which 
are exercised with much labour, but in 
weak and corrupt stomacks, not labouring 
very dangerous, for we say optimæ corumputur 
siunt pessimæ, the best nourishment 
corrupted proves most dangerous. 
 
[^p.30^] 
[}Sucking Pigs.}] 
 
Sucking Pigs are very nourishing, but 
they agree not with all constitutions, because 
too much humidity abounds in it, 
the fumous vapors ascends up to the head, 
in many causing pain, and swimings. 
 
[}Brawn.}] 
 
Of the flesh of tame Boars we usually 
make Brawn, being long corn fed, and 
young, makes a delicate meat, having not 
so much excrementitious moisture as Bacon 
or Pork, but the hard and horny part is 
difficultly concocted. 
 
[}Food taken from the parts of 
Animals.}] 
 
Aliment taken from the parts of Animals 
are many, which both according to 
the kinds of living Creatures, and according 
[^p.31^] 
to their diversity of parts do vary, 
the feet of Animals of what kind soever 
are cold and dry, they have little flesh, and 
scarce any blood, they yield a cold juice, 
dull and glutinous by reason whereof the 
broth wherein feet are boyled is turned to 
a jelley. 
 
[}Hearts.}] 
 
All hearts of Animals are of a hard and 
dry Nature and fibrous, neither is it easily 
concocted, but if it be well concocted, it 
yields neither ill juice nor a little, and that 
very stable and firm, chiefly corroberating 
the heart by sympathy. 
 
[}Liver.}] 
 
The Liver is very binding, and yields 
thick nourishment, but is hard to be concocted, 
which is slowly distributed. All 
Animals vary in their Liver, according to 
their age and feeding, the youngest and best 
fed are most delicate, and have the greatest 
Livers and fullest of juice. 
 
[^p.32^] 
[}Spleen.}] 
 
The Spleen as it is the receptable of 
gross Melancholly blood affords little 
nourishment, and is hardly concocted, 
therefore not fit for food. 
 
[}Lungs.}] 
 
The Lungs in substance are light and 
airy, therefore properly called the bellows 
of the body, they nourish but little, yet 
easie of concoction, and afford good 
nourishment. 
 
[}Bowels.}] 
 
The intestines afford not very good but 
thick Aliment, and the Bowels of younger 
Quadrapeds, as Calves are of better Juyce 
and easier concocted then of old. 
 
[^p.33^] 
[}Tongue.}] 
 
The Tongue excells the other parts in 
pleasant taste and goodness of alinent, and 
is also easily concocted. 
 
[}Brain.}] 
 
The Brain yields petuitous and thick 
juice, and is not easily concocted, nor distributed, 
and causeth loathing, except it be 
well sharpned with Vinegar. 
 
[}Venison.}] 
 
Although Venison be in high esteem both 
by Gentry and Peasant, yet it is hard of 
concoction and generates Melancholly 
juice especially if the Venison be grown 
to ripeness of years, it doth obstruct the 
bowels, the usual way of seasoning it doth 
much meliorat and make tender the flesh, 
and by drinking a glass of Wine therewith 
[^p.34^] 
it becomes good nourishment. 
 
[}Hare.}] 
 
Hares flesh is accounted by Physitians 
for Melancholly meat, therefore not to 
good for those that have dry bodies, yet 
they are thought to generate a good colour 
in the face, they are best boyled. 
 
[}Goates.}] 
 
Goates flesh afford good nourishment, 
and may well be offered before other sylvestrous 
Animals, for goodness of Aliment, 
facility of concoction, pleasantness 
of taste, pancity of excrements, yet they are 
something dryer. 
 
[}Conies.}] 
 
Conies if they be not old, yeild a good 
juice, are easie of concoction, and if 
throughly roasted very drying for the 
[^p.33^] 
Phlegmetick, young are safe food for sick 
people. 
 
[}Of fowle, first Turkies.}] 
 
Amongst tame Fowl the Turkie is of 
the uper ranck, both for the largeness of 
his body, goodness of food, having good 
juice, and laudable nourishment, it is most 
fit for those that are in health. 
 
[}Capons and Pullets and 
Chicken.}] 
 
Hens and Capons are accounted the 
chief among Birds, they are temperate 
easie of concoction, of good juice, and contain 
few excrements if young, and yield 
most profitable food to those who are not 
used to labour, they procreate good blood, 
yet there is great difference amongst this 
kind of Fowl, the best is the flesh of 
cram'd Capons, next it that of fat Chickens, 
the next are Pullets, as for old Cocks 
[^p.36^] 
and Hens, their flesh is harder and dryer, 
and not to be eaten, but by laborious 
people. 
 
[}Geese.}] 
 
The flesh of tame Geese doth abound 
more with excrements, then that of wild, 
yet the flesh of them both are of concoction, 
and yield no good juice, but vitious 
and excrementious, and such as is easily 
putrified, and in weak stomacks often 
cause surfeits, but in strong stomacks and if 
it be well concocted Geese affords plenty 
of nourishment, but the delacacy of a Goose 
is the Liver, which if it be well fatted especially 
with sweet food, as boyled carrots 
&c. The Liver will grow large, and 
is delicious and temperate meat, easie of 
concoction, of good juice and much 
nourishment, and indeed of more valew 
then the Carcass. 
 
[^p.37^] 
[}Duck and Mallard.}] 
 
Tame Ducks if not young are very hard 
of concoction, of ill juyce, and little nourishment, 
but the young ones are wholesome 
Food, and yeild good juyce for the 
wild Duck and Mallard, are much better 
then the tame, more tender of concoction, 
and yeilds good nourishment, and do not 
easily putrifie in the Stomack. 
 
[}Pheasants.}] 
 
Pheasants are most excellent Food, and 
are the best nourishment, for those that are 
in health, most easie of concoction, therefore 
safe and good for those that do not 
labor. 
 
[}Partridge and Quails.}] 
 
The Flesh of Partridges are temperate, 
and drying, easie of concoction, affords 
excellent juyce, and much nourishment, 
[^p.38^] 
and few excrements for those that are in 
health good, and for those that have Consumptions, 
or the French Pox, admirable 
nourishment. 
 
Quails are excellent Food for all in 
health, it is hot and moist, but the sick must 
not eat of them, because they are apt to 
generate Feavers. 
 
[}Pigeons.}] 
 
There are divers sorts of Pigeons, those 
of the Mountains and Woods are best, 
the flesh of all of them are of a melancholly 
Juyce not easily concocted, but most 
dangerous in a Putrid Feaver. 
 
[}Plovers.}] 
 
The Gray Plovers, exceed the Green, 
both are very good Food, easie of concoction, 
afford good nourishment, save that 
they are something melancholly. 
 
[^p.39^] 
[}Cocks, Snites, Thrushes.}] 
 
These Winter Birds are easily concocted, 
yeilds good Juyce, not excrementitious, 
and affords nourishent firm enough. 
 
[}Black birds.}] 
 
Black birds are something harder of concoction, 
then Thrushes, but are firm nourishment. 
 
[}Larks.}] 
 
The Lark generates excellent Juice and 
is easily concocted and it hath a peculiar 
qualitiy, not only to preserve one from 
the Chollick, but also to cure it. 
 
Having now run through most of our 
English Flesh meat, we will now proceed 
to the Fish. 
 
[^p.40^] 
[}CHAP. IX. 
Fish.}] 
 
FIshes are colder and moister Food then 
the Flesh of Terrestial animals, and 
scarce afford so good juyce as Corn, and 
Fruits, and other Vegitables, they do easily 
putrifie, and if they are corrupted they 
acquire a quality most dangerously averse 
to our natures, but there are great variety 
of Fish. 
 
[}A Salmon.}] 
 
A Salmon in the first place is tender of 
Flesh, grateful to the Pallate, easie of concoction, 
affords good juyce, and is not inferior 
to any, nay 'tis the best of Fish, but 
[^p.41^] 
when they are pickled with salt, and hardned 
with smoak, they are much worse and 
difficulty concocted. 
 
[}Trout.}] 
 
Trouts amongst Fishes which are bred in 
Fresh Waters are the best and are next in 
goodness to a Salmon, easie of concoction, 
full of much good and thin juyce, but the 
greater of them of flesh, not a little excrementitious, 
Fat, and Full of viscidity, those 
are commended above others, which have 
Red flesh, and many Red spots, and have 
hard flesh, and participates not of viscidity 
and Fat, those are easier concocted, descend 
sooner and not so excrementitious, in 
juyce. 
 
[}Soles, plaice, and Turbet.}] 
 
These Fish is highly commended amongst 
Sea-fishes which hath delicate flesh, 
and is easie of concoction, being white 
fleshed, yeilds good juyce, plentiful nourishment 
[^p.42^] 
and such as is not easily corrupted, 
but being dryed in the smoak they are 
much worse and harder of concoction. 
 
[}Gudgeons, Smelts.}] 
 
Gudgeons and Smelts are the best amongst 
the small sort of fish and very 
wholesome Aliment, easie to be concocted 
and such as remain not long in the stomack, 
and are profitable both for pleasure and 
health, and may safely be given to those 
that are sick, to these other little fish are 
alike as Dace and Minners, &c. 
 
[}A Carp.}] 
 
For dilicious taste especially if it be fat, 
is inferior to none, and if it be throughly 
decocted or stewed with Wine as the 
manner is, makes a Princely dish, and yields 
good nourishment and firm, but is not fit 
for sick People. 
 
[^p.43^] 
[}Pike.}] 
 
A Pike especially of the smaller growth 
hath hard Flesh, it is easily concocted and 
easily distributed, and hath not many excrements, 
and may also be given to those 
that are sick. 
 
[}Perch.}] 
 
A Perch also hath tender flesh, and such 
as will easily part asunder, and no Fat, nor 
glutinosity, 'tis easie to be digested, the 
Juyce is not evil, yet it affords weaker Aliment, 
and such as is easily discussed. 
 
[}Bream.}] 
 
A Bream hath soft and moist Flesh and 
yeilds a Juyce very excrementitious and is 
to be eaten, for the most part, as all other 
Fish are not, it is not to be mixed with divers 
kinds of meats. 
 
[^p.44^] 
[}Tench.}] 
 
Tench is neither of a pleasing tast nor 
easie to be concocted, nor good Aliment, 
but yeilds a filthy slymy juyce and such as 
is easily corrupted, neither is easily distributed 
and it brings forth obstructions. 
 
[}Barbel.}] 
 
A Barbel whose Eggs perchance gave an 
occasion for some to suppose that he hears 
very bad, it causes not only the pain of the 
belly but also vomiting, and disturbs the 
belly, and stirs up Choller, from the use 
thereof we ought to abstain, but the flesh 
thereof is very White, easie of concoction 
and distribution and affords Aliment of 
good juyce. 
 
[^p.45^] 
[}Eells.}] 
 
The Flesh of Eells is sweet but glutinous 
with Fat and abounding, with much 
moisture it generates ill juyce, and the use 
thereof is not safe for sick people, nor 
plentifully taken for those that are well. 
 
[}Lamprey.}] 
 
A Lamprey is a Fish of a grateful and 
delicious tast, if it be rightly prepared, and 
sauced, yet it puts not away its slymyness, 
wholly for which cause Physitians, do not 
number them among Fishes of the best sort. 
 
[}Herring.}] 
 
A Herring hath white flesh apt to cleave 
into small peices, hath a good taste, easie of 
concoction, it affords good juice, not thick 
[^p.46^] 
and glutinous when its pickled with salt, or 
hardned with smoak, which we call red 
Herrings, they are harder of concoction, 
and doth not nourish so much. 
 
[}Codfish.}] 
 
Codfish and Stockfish while it is fresh, 
hath friable flesh and tender, of good juice, 
and easie of concoction, yet being dryed it 
is hard of concoction, and affords thick 
nourishment, and is not to be eaten without 
danger to any save those that have healthy 
strong stomacks, and labor much. 
 
[}Sturgeon.}] 
 
Sturgeon commonly called Sea-beefe, 
hath hard fat and glutinous flesh, which 
yeilds a thick juice, yet safely to be eaten 
it is hard of concoction but firm: nutriment 
and very lasting to work upon. 
 
[^p.47^] 
[}Lobsters and Crabs.}] 
 
Lobsters, Crabfish, Praws and Crawfish 
are frequent in most Countries near 
the Sea, there is no great difference in their 
efficacy or nature, they are all hard of 
concoction, and will not digest but in 
a strong stomack yet if they are well concocted, 
they beget good juice, nourish 
much and stimulat Venus. 
 
[}Oysters.}] 
 
Oysters and Scollops have a soft juce, 
and therefore irritate the belly to dijection, 
and cleanse the Vereters stimulate Venus, 
they easily generate obstructions, being 
hard of concoction, and nourish but little. 
 
[^p.48^] 
[}CHAP. X. 
Meats from living Creatures.}] 
 
THere be many living Creatures 
which supply us with necessary food, 
agreeable to our Natures, as being nearer 
and more familiar with our Natures, and 
less exceed in the qualities, and afford 
better juice, as in the first place we will 
begin with milk. 
 
[}Milk.}] 
 
Milk is of a cold and moist, or rather of 
a temperate and moist Nature, and yields 
nourishment very good, the best by much 
if it be rightly concocted in the stomack, 
and the milk be good in its self. 
 
[^p.49^] 
[}Parts of Milk.}] 
 
[}There be three parts of Milk, viz.}] 
 
The Butrious, the Caseus, and the Serous, the 
Butrious, is of an oyly and hot substance, the 
Caseus is of a cold and dry substance, the 
Serous is of a watry, and indeed Cows milk 
is the fattest and thickest, and contains more 
milk then the milk of other Animals, 
and therefore nourisheth more, and is most 
agreeable to us, and hath more of the Caseous 
part then Ews milk, Goats milk is of a 
middle Nature between these two, sound 
Animals only generate good milk, but sick 
diseased Animals generate vitious and corrupt, 
dry meat as Hay &c. cause the milk 
to be thick, but green and such as are full 
of juice make much better, wherefore the 
milk at the latter end of the Spring is best, 
by how much the thiner it be, and more Serous 
by so much it is the easier concocted, 
and sooner passeth through the belly, and 
obstructs least, but nourisheth less, to know 
the best milk, it is of a good smel, and sweet 
to the taste, of a middle consistence, nether 
[^p.50^] 
too thick, nor too thin, neither Serous 
not Caseous, too much of a white colour 
which yields good Aliment, and that plentifully 
and constantly enough. 
 
Milk is nourishing enough especially for 
lean bodies, as being that which is elaboured 
by so many concoctions, and is thereby 
made Familiar to our natures, that 'tis 
easily and truly concocted, in unwholesome 
bodies, it is easily corrupted, as in 
a cold Stomach: it soon grows sowre in a 
hot, it is turned to an adust smell and choller, 
and causeth pain in the Head, wherefore 
it is hurtful to those that are sick of 
Putrid Feavers, and to those that have 
pains in the head, and sore Eyes, or are obnoxious 
to breed Gravel, and to those that 
are obstructed in the Liver, and are inflamed 
in the Hypochondries, according to the 
Apho. 64. But the worst corruption thereof 
is when it is coagulated, which may be 
prevented if any Salt, Sugar or Honey be 
added to it, it is most conveniently taken 
on an empty Stomach, nor are other Meats 
to be eaten presently after, especially the 
use of wine after milk is very unwholesome. 
 
[^p.51^] 
As for the parts of Milk, Butter is used 
in England and other Countries instead of 
Food, and sawce. Butter is hot and moist 
almost of the same Nature with Oyl, yet it 
nourisheth more, and is sawce for most 
Meat, 'tis pleasant to the taste, 'tis easily 
concocted, and nourisheth much, yet it agreeth 
not with those that have a moist and 
slippery Stomach, yet 'tis far better to be 
taken before other Meats then after, nor is 
it so agreeable to hot Natures, 'tis conveniently 
eaten with bread. 
 
Sowre Milk is colder, and agreeth not 
with colder Stomachs, but with hotter, especially 
in the Summer and very hot 
weather, it is refreshing and concocts 
well. 
 
Although in Consumptions, sometimes is 
prescribed womans Milk, Asses Milk, or 
Goats Milk, yet for Food none is so good 
as Cows milk, and of that sort the Red Cow 
is best, and in a Consumption, I should prefer 
it before the former, being taken warm 
while the spirit of the animal is in it. 
 
[^p.52^] 
[}Cheese.}] 
 
Cheese is good and is agreeable to most 
and very desireable to whom it is Friendly, 
is hardly concocted, and yeilds thick nourishment, 
and therefore stops the belly, 
opens the pores, and affords matter fit for 
the generation of Stones, but that which is 
old affords ill nourishment, and if taken in 
quantity, obstructs much it is very useful 
to close the mouth of the Stomach, after a 
full meal, being eaten to the quantity of a 
dram or two. New Cheese may be eaten 
more plentifully, because it affords better 
nourishment, and while new it is cold and 
moist, and of a flatulent Nature, middle 
Age Cheese, which is neither hard nor 
soft, and is moderately sweet and Fat, is 
the best, but of what kind soever it be, it 
is always to be eaten sparingly, and after 
other meats, now there is great differences 
of Cheese, according to the nature of 
living Creatures, and diversity of pastures, 
and Countries, that of the Ewe is the best, 
[^p.53^] 
because it is easier concocted then the rest, 
and nourisheth more, next in goodness is 
Cows Cheese, the Goats is the worst of 
all; But no Cheese is good without the 
Butrious part be also included with the 
Caseous. 
 
[}Whey.}] 
 
The thinnest part of Milk, which is 
called Serum or Whey, is more fit for 
medicine then Food, and is most fitly 
used for the evacuation of serous and 
adust humours, it consisteth of two parts, 
the one is Salt, and participating of acrimony, 
and is altogether hot, which is 
the lesser part, the other is Watry, and is 
the greater part, therefore it is called cold 
and moist. 
 
[^p.54^] 
[}Eggs.}] 
 
Eggs and chiefly those of Hens, are a 
Food much used and esteemed amongst us, 
an Egg consists of two parts the yolk, and 
the white, the yolk is moderately hot and 
moist, and very corroborating, the white is 
cold and dry, and affords also much nourishment, 
and that lasting enough, but hard 
of concoction. 
 
The newest Eggs are the best, and nourish 
most and soonest, and yeild good Aliment, 
but the stalest are the worst, and the 
corruption of Eggs is most dangerous, 
for we say (optimæ fiunt pessimæ) the best food 
corrupted becomes the worst and most 
perillous, they do not well agree with 
those whose Liver and Stomachs are filled 
with vitious humours, and in Chollerick 
& hot Stomachs they are easily corrupted 
& turned into Choller, as for the cooking 
of them they are best when the yolk is soft, 
& the Rear hardned to a white colour, and 
so supt up, being boyled in water, they 
[^p.55^] 
may easily be given to a weak Stomach, 
they are stronger in tast, boyled in the shell 
then potched, especially in Roasted, but 
the worst way of dressing them, is to fry 
them in a pan. 
 
[}Honey.}] 
 
Honey is of a hot and dry Nature in the 
second degree, but that which is white is 
not so hot, and is the best and most commodious 
for those that be found, but all 
Honey is a medicinal Aliment, convenient 
for old men, and those of cold constitutions, 
but it is not fit for Chollerick persons, 
because it turns into Choller, therefore 
not good for the Liver, but very good 
for the Lungs, because it hath an abstersive 
cleansing faculty, and resists putrifaction. 
 
[^p.56^] [^Original misnumbered as p.48.^] 
[}Sugar.}] 
 
Although it comes not from Animals, 
but is made of Canes, for its agreement 
with Honey may well be put together, yet 
it is not so hot as Honey, therefore properly 
mingled with many sorts of Food, 
and Medicine, and doth preserve medicines 
better then Honey, and hath the same 
cleansing quality in the body of man, though 
not so griping in the belly. 
 
[^p.57^] 
[}CHAP. XI. 
Meats from Plants, or 
Vegetables.}] 
 
[}Wheat.}] 
 
AS for Grains or Fruits, being the most 
ordinary kind of Food, amongst 
which in the first Rank are all sorts of 
Wheat, and Grain, which the Greeks call 
by the name of Sitou, and in the first place 
Wheat is hot and moist, and above all Vegitables 
affords much nourishment, and 
that firm and most wholesome, out of 
Wheat divers kind of Foods are made, yet 
the best among them is bread, and that leavened 
or fermented, which agrees to every 
[^p.58^] 
Age, and is to be taken with all meats. 
 
[}Barley.}] 
 
The bread which is made of Barley is 
colder, and yeilds not so good nourishment 
as Wheat, there is a sort of Barley cal'd 
Spelt, is next in nature to Wheat, and is 
the middle betwixt Wheat and Barley, and 
nourisheth more then Barley, but is weaker 
then Wheat; Barley is also made into 
ptisan or broath, which is a good nourishment 
for sick people, and those that are well 
also, and is not viscid or clammy, but easily 
passeth through and cleanseth the passages 
and Reins, of which all Physitians are 
well acquainted being generally prescribed 
to the sick, 
 
[}Rye.}] 
 
Rye of which bread is made in some parts 
of this Kingdom, and for its delicious 
sweetness and moisture, is frequently mixed 
with Wheat, by nature it is hot and dry, 
it is hotter then Barley, yet not so hot as 
[^p.59^] 
Wheat but the bread which is made of it 
is harder of concoction then that of Wheat, 
and Windy, causing in some griping 
pains. 
 
[}Rice.}] 
 
Rice is hot and dry, or rather temperate, 
it nourisheth much, especially boyled with 
Milk, it increaseth seed. 
 
Rice doth not easily putrifie, it stops 
lasks or looseness of the belly, it is hardly 
concocted and yeilds nourishment somewhat 
thick, the frequent use of it may easily 
occasion Obstructions. 
 
[}Oats.}] 
 
Are almost of the same Nature, and are 
cold and dry, Oatmeal stops Fluxes of the 
Belly, they afford not much nourishment, 
yet are very useful in Pottages and broaths, 
which may be given to sick or well, it stops 
the looseness of the belly. 
 
[^p.60^] 
[}Beans.}] 
 
Beans are cold and dry, flatulent, hard 
of concoction, and yeild excrementitious 
nourishment, yet not viscid, and have some 
cleansing power, they make the senses 
dull, and noises become troublesome. 
 
[}Pease.}] 
 
Pease are cold and dry, flatulent, especially 
the green, yet they yeild better nourishment 
then beans, but not so plentiful, 
yet easier of concoction, and very pleasing 
to Stomachs surfeited with overfulness of 
stronger Food. 
 
[}Parsnips.}] 
 
Parsnips are hot and dry, not very good 
nourishment have a great Force of cleansing, 
provoke Lust, they are more useful in 
Physick then Food, they provoke Urine, 
and bring down the Menses. 
 
[^p.61^] 
[}Turnips.}] 
 
Turnips afford strong nourishment, stimulate 
Venus, the long Turnips commonly 
are the better, they are safely eaten 
with Meat, or alone buttered, being baked 
their Juyce makes a very good Surrup for a 
Consumption. 
 
[}Carrots.}] 
 
Carrots are hot and dry, flatulent, 
these as well as the former, are very 
wholesome and provoke to Venery, and are 
opening, easie of Concoction, and yeilds 
good Aliment. 
 
[}Radish and Mustard.}] 
 
Radishes which we commonly use for 
sawce, afford little nousrihment, they heat 
beyond the second degree, and have a sharp 
taste, they cut Phlegm, attenuate and provoke 
Urine, break the Stone, and expels 
[^p.62^] 
Gravel from the Veins, yet cause a ructation 
or belching of wind from the Stomach 
the wild are hotter and more Forcible, 
Mustard is much for heat, tast and efficacy 
like the Root of Wild Horse radish. 
 
[}Leeks and Garlick.}] 
 
Leeks and Garlick are near of Nature, 
but the Garlick is the hotter and more potent, 
they are hot and dry, little nourishment 
and that bad, they have a power of 
attenuating thick Phlegm, and viscid humours, 
taking away cold, and this is a 
good Remedy for the pravity of Waters 
also against the Plague and venemous 
Air. 
 
[}Onions.}] 
 
Onions also afford but little nourishment, 
have a heating, attenuating, cutting 
Faculty, inflame the blood, they leave behind 
them a thick Juyce, provoke Venus, 
they are all hurtful to the Head, Eyes, 
[^p.63^] 
Teeth, and Gums, and cause disturbive 
sleep and turbulent dreams. 
 
[}Cabbage.}] 
 
Cabbage is generally accounted to be 
cold and dry, yet the bitterness and acrimony 
of the Juyce is observed to stir the belly 
'tis hard of concoction, affords little nourishment, 
and that thick and melancholly, 
from whence fulliginous vapours fly into 
the head and produce turbalent sleep, and 
weakens the sight, and are very dangerous 
for those are incident to a Vertigo, or 
swimming in the head. 
 
Being boyled in the broath with Fat 
Meat, it is somewhat corrected, yet the 
stinking coction or broath, shews its danger, 
and that its only fitting for laborious 
people. 
 
[^p.64^] 
[}Artechoaks.}] 
 
Artechoaks heat and dry to the second 
degree, they afford no good Aliment, they 
are hard of concoction, and stimulate Venus, 
Windy, yet the Meat of the Leaves, 
Stalks, and Roots do wonderfully cleanse 
the Reins, sending forth stinking Urine, 
and cures the Running of the Reins; if it be 
decocted in White-wine, and the decoction 
drank. 
 
[}Lettice.}] 
 
Letttice is esteemed the best of Sallads, 
affords more nourishment then other herbs, 
'tis cold and moist, and corrects Choller, 
and good for hot Stomachs, it provokes 
sleep, allays the heat of the Reins, but too 
much doth diminish the natural heat. 
 
[^p.65^] 
[}Spinnage}] 
 
Spinnage cools, and moistens, affords 
little nourishment, it generates cold and 
Serous humours in the Stomach, unless it be 
corrected with Oyl, Pepper, or Butter, it 
is not profitable and begets wind. 
 
[}Beets, Orach, and 
Mallows.}] 
 
They all loosen the belly by humectation, 
they nourish little, and yeilds a watry 
Juyce, and unpleasing of tast, except the 
sawce mends them. 
 
[}Asparagus.}] 
 
Asparagus and like to them are the young 
branches of Hops, they neither heat, nor 
manifestly cool, they are grateful to the 
[^p.66^] 
tast and cause Appetite, yet afford little 
nourishment, they have a detergent cleansing 
faculty, provoke Urine, they cleanse 
the Reins open Obstructions of the Liver, and 
other intrails. 
 
[}Parsley.}] 
 
Pasrsley is hot and dry, provokes Urine, 
and the courses opens Obstructions, purges 
the Reins and Bowels, yet it affords but 
little nourishment. 
 
[}Purslain.}] 
 
Purslain is an excellent Sallad with Oyl, 
it cools the Reins, helps such as have a 
scalding of Urine, and pain by heat, also 
Rectifies the Teeth being set on Edge. 
 
[^p.67^] 
[}Mints.}] 
 
Mints are pleasing in smell, especially 
Spear mints, which are hot and dry, and 
very strengthning to the Stomach, they stay 
Vomiting and are a most excellent Sallad 
minced in Vinegar and Sugar for any fresh 
meat. 
 
[}Melones.}] 
 
Melones are pleasant in tast, and send 
forth an Aromatick smell, but are of a cold 
watry moist substance, whereby they quench 
thirst and cause Urine, they cool and cleanse 
the Reins, but are easily corrupted, and being 
corrupted, become as it were of a poysonous 
nature, and stir up Choller, or 
generate Feavers, whereby many great 
men are killed, therefore they ought to be 
eaten at the first course, or before meat 
that they may the easier descend through 
the belly, and after the eating of them some 
[^p.68^] 
good Food ought to be eaten, and good 
Wine to be drank that their corrupting 
may be hindred. 
 
[}Cucumbers.}] 
 
Cucumbers are also cold, but not so 
moist, and the Juyce not so dangerous not 
so easily corrupted in the Stomach, they 
are least offensive to hot Stomachs. 
 
[}Strawberries.}] 
 
Strawberries are cold and moist; they 
are profitable to those that are troubled 
with Choller in the Stomach, they cool 
the Liver and restrain the heat of blood, 
and Chollerick humours, they allay thirst, 
therefore profitable to hot constitutions, 
they have thin juyce purge the Reins cause 
Urine, but are easie corrupted in the Stomach, 
therefore ought to be eaten before 
meat. 
 
[^p.69^] 
[}Fruits of Trees,}] 
 
[}First of Apples,}] 
 
Apples there are divers sorts, which 
discover themselves by their tast, the sowre 
are colder then the sweet, and of a thin and 
less flatulent substance, the austere and 
sharp are yet colder and of a thick substance, 
and descend more slowly through 
the belly and stay it, yet their violence is 
corrected by boiling and sowre sharp Apples 
are rather to be used for Medicine 
then Aliment, they afford ill Juyce, but 
those are worst, which are watry and have 
little or no tast, the best have a sweet Aromatick 
tast and smell, and such as afford 
an indifferent quantity of Aliment, they 
strengthen the Heart, exhilerate the mind, 
and are very beneficial to those which are 
troubled with Melancholly. 
 
[^p.70^] 
[}Pears.}] 
 
Pears there are of divers kinds and faculties, 
the austere and sharp are astringent and 
cooling, and hurtful to the Stomach and 
Guts, sweat are more temperate, yet almost 
all are of a cold moist nature, but 
some are hot and moist, if taken before meat 
they are apt to stop a looseness, being taken 
after meat, they loosen the belly, and shut 
the mouth of the Stomach they are better 
boyled then raw. 
 
[}Quinces.}] 
 
Quinces are cold and dry, and have an astringent 
quality they afford little nourishment 
and are hard of concoction, they 
strengthen the Stomach, stop vomiting, and 
if they are taken after meat, hinder vapours 
so that they cannot easily ascend to the 
Head and so loosen the Belly, but being 
taken before meats they stops a looseness, 
[^p.71^] 
if they are eaten raw, they hurt the Nerves 
and often cause Fits of the Chollick, and 
Obstructions. 
 
[}Peaches.}] 
 
Peaches are cold and moist, and easily 
corrupted, and afford little nourishment, 
and therefore are to be eaten sparingly, and 
warily, and not without danger to cold 
Stomachs, and they are to be eaten before 
meals not after other meats, neither is water 
or any cold drink to be drank after them 
but generous Wine, being dryed they are 
less hurtful, but best boyled in Wine, 
whereby their pravity is taken away and 
become not dangerous. 
 
[}Apricocks.}] 
 
Apricocks are far beoynd Peaches in 
goodness and are more pleasing to the Stomach 
and are not easily corrupted. 
 
[^p.72^] 
[}Medlers.}] 
 
Medlers are cold and dry, and are not 
eaten till they are Rotten, they afford little 
nourishment, and are slowly concocted, 
they stop the belly and all Flux, they stay 
vomiting and agree well with a Chollerick 
Stomach. 
 
[}Cherries.}] 
 
All Cherries have a cooling Faculty, but 
the sowre especially, they are easily concocted 
and quickly descend through the 
belly, and cool the Stomach and Liver, 
they quench thirst, and raise an Appetite, 
and are not so easily corrupted, nor of so 
hurtful a Juyce as the sweet ones, which 
are much inferiour to the sharp in goodness 
by reason of the moisture abounding 
are easily corrupted and generate Putrid 
humours, and sometimes Worms in Putrid 
Feavers, taken by surfeit, and overmuch 
[^p.73^] 
eating them, yet the black are most 
wholesome, and indeed Medicinal against 
Convulsions. 
 
[}Plumbs and Prunes.}] 
 
Plumbs in general are cold and moist, 
but there are divers kind of Plumbs, the 
sweet ones are not so cold as the sower 
in nature, they are chiefly profitable to 
cholorick stomachs, they are easily concocted 
and pass through the belly, those 
that are fresh after most powerfully, they 
mollify the belly being taken before meat, 
but very dangerous taken after by reason 
they scatter abroad many excrements and 
that crude, they do not generate good juice 
those which abound most with a moist crude 
juice are the worst, also the white or yellowish 
are the worst, but the best are of a 
black or blew colour like Damsons and 
Damask Prunes, the dry are more fit for 
nourishment for those that are weak in stomach, 
plumbs are not convenient because 
[^p.74^] 
they loosen its strength by a cooling moisture. 
 
[}Mulburies.}] 
 
Mulburies do very powerfully quench 
thirst from their moisting and cooling quality, 
they mitigate choller, but nourish little, 
they easily pass through the belly, but if 
they are retained they are easily corrupted 
and become putred, and acquire an ill Nature 
wherefore they are to be eaten when 
the stomach is empty only and not stuffed 
with peccant humours that they mey quickly 
descend through the belly. 
 
[}Figs.}] 
 
Figs are hot and moist by Nature, and 
nourish very much above any other Fruits, 
they easily descend and pass through the 
belly, they have a penetrating and cleansing 
faculty, yet too much use of them begets 
Wind, dry Figs are hotter and dryer, then 
[^p.75^] 
green and are of a very opening and attenuating 
quality, and do also loosen the belly, 
and drive humours to the external parts, 
therefore profitably taken by Women near 
their time of travel they generate blood also 
but none of the best. 
 
[}Grapes.}] 
 
Grapes that are sweet, are hot, and therefore 
cause thirst, sharp, sower, austere are 
colder, therefore allay drotwh or thirst, 
the mean between sweat and sowre are best 
to make Wine of, the fresh gathered, ate flatulent, 
windy, afford little nourishment, and 
if they are detained long in the Stomach, 
are corrupted and dilate the belly, and stir 
up Chollick Fits, and cause the Spleen to 
swell, and fill the Stomach and Liver, with 
crude humours, the fresh gathered serve 
rather for pleasure then health, but the best 
are the sweet ones, mixt with a little sharp 
tast, those without stones loosen the belly 
more, but with stones strengthen the Stomach. 
 
[^p.76^] 
[}Almonds and Nuts.}] 
 
Sweet Almonds are the best of Nuts, and 
of them the largest and sweetest are most 
to be desired, they are temperately hot and 
moist, and yeilds store of nourishment, and 
of good juyce and moderate, they attenuate 
and cleanse, for which Reason they are the 
best Food for imatiated bodies, and they 
replenish the intrails, and the whole body 
with convenient nourishment, and such as 
is not apt to corruption, they purge the 
breast, open Obstructions of the Urinary 
passage, and cause sleep, but are not so useful 
for a Chollerick Stomach, nor good to 
be given in Feavers, proceeding from 
Choller, they are usually given to the Sick, 
dissolved in broaths, which are called emulsions. 
 
[}Filberds and Hasle-Nuts.}] 
 
The best of Hasle Nuts are Filbers and 
[^p.77^] 
do come nearest to Almonds in vertue, but 
they are hot and dry in quality, hardly digested 
afford a thick juyce if old the young 
or newly gathered are the best. 
 
[}Walnuts.}] 
 
Walnuts if new gathered are hot and 
moist, the old are hot and dry in faculty, 
the new are safer eaten then the old, for the 
old generates Choller, offend the orifice of 
the Stomach, and hurt the Gullet, or 
Wind-pipe, cause a Cough, and causeth 
pain in the head, the use of them is commended 
after eating of Fish, because their 
heating and dryness prevent the corruption 
of Fish. 
 
[}Chestnuts.}] 
 
Gallen that learned Physitian believes 
that Chestnuts have no ill juyce, as all 
other Fruits of Trees have, they are hot 
[^p.78^] 
and dry, and if they are well concocted, 
nourish very much, and affords durable 
nourishment, they bind the belly, and if 
they are eaten in too great plenty, generates 
Wind. 
 
[}Olives Oyle.}] 
 
Olives are temperate, and the Oyl drawn 
from them that are Ripe, affords nourishment 
temperate, and agreeable to our Nature, 
and can correct the pravity of other 
Aliments, amends the crudity of Herbs, 
Resists poyson, it mollifies and loosens the 
belly, it takes away sharpness, it helps 
Ruptures, and such as are bursten bellied, 
and mittigates pain internally and externally. 
 
[^p.79^] 
[}Mushromes and Toadstools.}] 
 
Lastly, since the wantonness of some 
will eat Mushromes, yet they are not eaten 
without danger, they are by nature cold, 
they yeild a watry and thick nourishment, 
but oftentimes they are poysonous therefore 
better let alone then eaten. 
 
Now we have passed through all eatable 
things, it is necessary we speak next of 
all sorts of Drink.
