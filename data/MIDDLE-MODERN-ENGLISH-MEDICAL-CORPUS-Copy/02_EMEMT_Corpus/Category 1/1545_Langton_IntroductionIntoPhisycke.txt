[}The .i. Chapter. 
Of the diuersitie of sectes 
in phisike, & which 
are to be folowed.}] 
 
THe olde and aunciente 
phisitions, amonge the 
Grekes whyche passed 
al other in phisike were 
deuyded into .iii. sectes. 
They that were of the first sect, were 
called Empirici: and they that were 
of the seconde secte, were called Methodici: 
the last and best were called 
dogmatici. Empirici were they that 
wroughte onelye by experience, and 
[^f.7v^] 
thought it a great poynt of wisdom 
in no case to admyt reason, markynge 
very diligently, by what maner meanes 
they had healed anye maladyes 
or diseases, in the whych yf they had 
lyke successe afterwarde by healpe of 
the same medicins, than they were 
bolde to call that same medicine, by 
the whiche they had holpen oftentymes 
one kynde of disease, Preceptum 
fidele, whyche is as muche to saye as 
a faythfull precepte, and whan they 
had gathered of these a greate numbre, 
they called the whole gatheri~ges 
in greke, [^GREEK OMITTED^]: whyche in Latyn 
woorde for woorde, is as muche to 
saye, as Intuitus proprius. and in oure 
vulgare tongue, it maye very wel be 
called a certayne memorye of those 
thynges, the whyche hath bene sene 
oftentymes to chaunce of one sorte, 
the whych also may very wel be called 
[^f.8r^] 
experience, for it is nothynge, but 
an obseruation and memory of that 
whych hath chaunsed oftentymes after 
one fassion. Than after that they 
had gathered after thys fasshion, a 
great many of experime~tes, they did 
vtterly abolyshe, and condempne all 
reason as voyde, and of none effecte 
to the learnyng of phisyke. They dyd 
also nothyng regarde the tyme of the 
yere, the temperature of the wether, 
nor yet the powers of y=e= pacient, puttynge 
no dyfference betwyxte yonge 
and olde, weake or stronge, whote or 
coulde, drye or moyste, but thoughte 
that they might safelye venture that 
vpon one, wyth the whych they had 
healed another in lyke disease, and 
of thys secte was Thessalus, & Cornelius 
Celsus, wyth all theyr scholers. 
The seconde secte was called 
Methodica, the whych dyd nothing 
[^f.8v^] 
regard the place affected, nor y=e= cause 
of the gryefe, nor the age of the pacient, 
nor the tyme of the yere: nor the 
temperature of the countrye, nor the 
habyte of the sycke manne, nor yet 
the kynde of hys former lyfe, & constantly 
affirming that there was but 
two dyseases, the one the stoppynge 
of the pores, and the other the ouermuche 
openyng of the same: condemned 
vtterly Hyppocrates, because he 
sayde that physike was a longe arte 
and that mans lyfe was very short: 
for they affyrme that it is clene contrary, 
that is to saye, that mans lyfe 
is longe, and phisyke is so shorte an 
arte, that yf all thynges whyche (as 
they saye) be superfluous, were cutte 
out: it myght be learned easely in .vi. 
monethes. They discent also from 
the fyrste secte of phisitions, in that 
they thynke there commeth no profyte 
[^f.9r^] 
of experience, vntyll suche tyme 
as they haue learned the vertues & 
faculties of medicines and remedies 
And moreouer that it is not possible 
to fynde any remedye or medicyne, 
by diligent markynge, seing that all 
remedyes, be gathered of suche thinges 
as be euident to the sense, and of 
this secte and opinion was Erassistratus, 
& Asclepiades with all theyr 
retinue. The thyrd and last sect were 
called Dogmatici, the which ioined 
experience alwayes with reason (co~syderynge 
very diligently the causes 
of the euyll, as well those that be obscure, 
and harde to fynde as those also, 
whiche are euydent and open to 
euery mans eye) and doth giue moch 
both to the nature of the ayer & water, 
and region, where the sycke abydeth, 
stedfastly affyrmyng that it is 
moost necessarye for the Phisitions, 
[^f.9v^] 
both to knowe and consydre the differences 
of the same, & also to marke 
diligentlye his accustomed dyet, as 
well in meates and drynkes, as bathes, 
exercyses, and other thynges. 
And to co~pare thynges that be past, 
wyth suche as be present, & to know 
perfytely the powres and vertues of 
medicines, by the whiche they maye 
take easely away the cause of al maladyes, 
and finally that he be suche a 
one the which ca~ proue and improue 
by good reason, that this medycyne 
hath this facultye of nature, to the 
whyche he maye attayne, by the 
helpe of Logycke, he muste knowe 
also (they saye) the internall partes, 
by dyligent searche, and cuttynges 
of bodyes, he must be sene also in naturall 
Phylosophye, Astronomye, 
Mathematycke, and Arithmatycke. 
[^f.10r^] 
Of thys sect was Gallen, and longe 
before him Hipocrates, whom wold 
to God our Phisitions wolde sette 
as a glasse before theyr eyes, I wold 
then thynke, that Physycke shoulde 
not be so lytle sette by as it is. But 
alas, there is no mans Physycke so 
lytle regarded nowe a dayes as Galennes 
is, and in deede to saye the 
truthe, it maye very well be perceyued, 
by theyr doinges, that they wer 
neuer Galennes scholers: for he teacheth 
them, not to iudge all dyseases 
by the vryne, where as the moste 
parte of them (I do not saye all) after 
that they haue ones sene the water 
of the sycke, yea though they neuer 
knewe hym, nor can not be enfourmed 
by the bearer in what state 
he is in, wyll not stycke to wryte the 
Appotecarie a byl for such maner of 
drugges, y=t= if they were layed before 
[^f.10v^] 
theyr eyes, they coulde not tell, whether 
they were the same y=t= they write 
for, or no. How is it possible for these 
Phisitions, to do any lesse then kyll 
theyr pacientes, but it maketh y=e= lesse 
matter, seinge they be hyred to it, 
wyth golde and syluer. 
 
Well, I wyll saye nomore at thys 
tyme, but surely, yf I were disposed 
I coulde proue that there is as moch 
iugglyng, and deceyuyng of the people 
now a dayes amongest our phisitions, 
I wyll name none (but euerye 
man knoweth his owne weakenesse 
and infirmitie) as euer was amongest 
the Popysh preestes, and a 
redresse myght be had, yf if pleased 
the kynges hyghnesse, y=t= none might 
be suffered to practyse, but suche as 
be learned. 
 
[}The .ii. Chapter. 
[^f.11r^] 
Of the Elementes.}] 
 
NOw after that I haue declared 
and opened the sectes 
and opynions of the 
mooste noble and moost 
auncient Physitions, I 
I thynke it verye mete to shewe the 
nature of the Elementes, whyche be 
iiii. in numbre: the fyre, ayer, water, 
and earth. But to auoyde ambiguitie, 
I wyl (by goddes grace) fyrst declare 
the signification of this worde 
Elementum, which we maye verye 
well call in our tonge a begynnynge 
of any thynge: and thereof it co~meth 
y=t= the Alphabete letters be called eleme~tes, 
bicause they are beginners of 
al maner of languages, & the principles 
also of euery arte be called Elementes, 
bycause they are begynners 
of the same. The Phisitions also do 
[^f.11v^] 
call the veynes pulses, and bones, w=t= 
all other suche partes as the Latyne 
men call similares, sensible elementes: 
bycause they are the fyrst beginners 
of mannes bodye, as moche as 
maye be perceyued by sense. For the 
fyre, ayer, water and earth, (of the 
which all thynges vnder the moone 
be made) can not be perceyued by any 
sence: wherfore as they are y=e= fyrst 
begynners of mannes bodye, so they 
are not the fyrst sensyble begynners. 
For yf they coulde be perceyued by 
sence, then euerye man as he passeth 
other in quycknesse of sence, so shuld 
he se, and feale moost fyne elementes 
as the Aegle, bycause his syght is 
moost perfyte, shoulde easelyest perceyue 
the least Element, but percase 
some wyll saye vnto me, that there 
is no man so madde to saye, that the 
fyre, ayre, erth, and water, can not be 
[^f.12r^] 
felte, and perceyued by sense: But 
whosoeuer shal moue this doubt, I 
wyll answer hym, of thys fassyon: 
that yf he meane our fyre, our water 
or our earth, I wyl saye as he sayth 
which is, that they may be felte and 
perceyued by sense. For in dede they 
are no Elementes, but thinges mixt 
and corruptyble: hauyng theyr composition 
of dyuerse thynges, where 
as the pure element is a body moost 
simple, withoute all generation or 
corruption. Howe be it, of fyre made 
thycke, commeth ayer: and of ayer 
made thycke, co~meth water: and of 
water made thycke, commeth earth. 
And yet here is neyther corruption, 
nor yet generation of the whole, for 
this is a mutatio~ of the partes only. 
Then as I sayde before, Elementu~ 
in this signification is a body moost 
pure and simple, and the leest parte 
[^f.12v^] 
of the same, wherin it is: whiche can 
not be deuyded into any other kinde, 
and of it all thynges naturall haue 
theyr originall begynnynge. This 
definition is taken both out of Gallen 
and Aristotle: therfore I truste, 
no man wyll be so impudent to contrary 
or impugne it. And there be also 
as is aforesayd .iiii. Elementes, of 
the whiche the fyre is extreme hotte, 
and moderatly drie: the ayer extreme 
moyst, and moderatly hotte: the water 
extreme colde, and moderatelye 
moyst: the earth is extreme drie, and 
moderatelye colde. In heate the fyre 
with the ayer, and in drynesse w=t= the 
earth, in moysture the ayer w=t= the water, 
& in heate with the fyre, in coldenesse 
the water with the earth, & in 
moysture with the ayer, the earth in 
drynesse w=t= the fyre, & in coldnesse w=t= 
the water, doeth consent and agree. 
[^f.13r^] 
And as y=e= water to y=e= fyre is extreme 
contrarye, so is the ayer to the earth. 
Of the myxture of these elementes, 
al natural bodies haue theyr composition, 
& yet it is nothing necessary y=t= 
they be equally myngled in the body 
but accordyng to that, that hath dominion, 
the bodye is named eyther 
choleryke, sanguyne, phlegmatycke, 
or melancholye: and these names be 
gyuen of .iiii. natural humours, that 
is choler, blood, flegme, and melancholie, 
whyche take theyr qualityes 
of the elementes, for choler is hotte 
and drye accordynge to the nature of 
the fyer, and blood is hote & moyste, 
accordyng to the nature of the ayer, 
flegme is colde and moyst, according 
to the water, and melancholye in no 
poynt dyssenteth from the earthe. 
 
[}The thyrde Chapiter. 
The differences of temperatures.}] 
 
[^f.13v^] 
NOwe that I haue declared 
vnto you, howe 
all naturall bodyes be 
made by the mixture of 
the elementes, I thinke 
it most necessary, to shewe in as fewe 
woordes as I can, the differences of 
temperatures. 
 
Temperatures in numbre are .ix. 
of the whyche .viii. do excede, & therfore 
in my fantasie, they maye better 
be called distemperatures, than temperate 
crases: the nynthe in dede is 
temperate, for it excedeth in no qualitie. 
Of the distemperate .iiii. be simple, 
and .iiii. be compou~de. the simple 
are heate, colde, drynes & moysture, 
of the whych coupled and ioyned togyther, 
the rest whyche be distemperate 
are made. The nynth is neither 
hote, colde, drye nor moyst, and yet is 
made of them all: and therefore the 
[^f.14r^] 
grekes call it [^GREEK OMITTED^], whyche is as 
muche to saye in latyn, as Bene temperatum, 
and in Englyshe: wel tempered. 
And this is that whyche Arithmetricions 
call Temperamentu~ ad pondus, 
whyche we maye cal in our language, 
a complection measured by 
weyght, bycause there are as many 
degrees of heat, as there is of colde, 
of dryenes as of moysture: the other 
whyche are distemperate crases, be 
measured not by weyght, but by dignitie, 
as in the heart wel tempered, 
heate doth excede, in the brayne well 
tempered, moysture doth exceade, in 
the fatte well tempered, colde: in the 
boones well tempered, dryenes. 
 
And thys is called Temperamentum, 
secundum iustitiam distributatiuam. 
 
Whyche is as muche for to saye, as 
a temperature measured accordynge 
to iustice, whiche gyueth euery man 
[^f.14v^] 
hys owne. But peraduenture thys 
declaration shall seeme some what 
harde to suche as be vnlearned: and 
therfore I entende to declare y=e= same 
agayne, bothe more largely and also 
more playnelye. 
 
Fyrste ye shall vnderstande, that 
these .iiii. heate, colde, dryenes and 
moysture, whych are called the first 
qualities, because all other come 
of them, haue eche of them .iii. diuers 
significations. Whansoeuer ye fynd 
heate, colde, drynes or moysture, absolutely 
and simply spoken, than vnderstande 
that it is meante by those 
simple bodyes, which be hote, colde, 
drye and moyste, in the hygheste degree: 
and that is onely the fyer, water, 
earthe and ayer, whyche be the .iiii. 
elementes whereof we spake before. 
And whan ye fynde the same 
qualities myxt in any natural body, 
[^f.15r^] 
by the which it is named eyther hote 
colde, drye or moyste, than suppose y=t= 
it is spoken eyther by comparison, as 
hote for hotter, colde for coulder, dry 
for dryer, or moyst for moyster, or els 
that it is hote, colde, drye or moyste 
by nature, as whan there is in one 
bodye, more heate than colde, more 
drynes than moysture, or otherwise. 
as Summer is called hote, bycause 
it hath more heate than colde: Winter 
also is called colde, be cause that 
it hath more colde than heate: & hereof 
it commeth, that one bodye is choleryke, 
because in the myxture of the 
foure humoures, whyche is choler, 
blood, flegme and melancholy, there 
is more of choler, than of anye other, 
and therfore choler hath the dominion, 
causynge the bodye to be named 
cholerycke after it: and in lyke maner 
doth eche of the other, where he beareth 
[^f.15v^] 
rule & gouernaunce. But he that 
wyl knowe perfectly howe to iudge 
the differences of bodies in temperature 
by comparison, must constitute 
in euery kynde of thynges, that same 
temperate meane, whyche before we 
called Eucraton to the whiche he must 
referre the same bodye or complexio~, 
of the whyche he dowteth, and than 
yf it doe excede the meane, eyther in 
heate, colde, drynesse or moysture, it 
shall take name therof, and be called 
eyther hote, colde, drye or moyste, because 
it exceadeth the meane whiche 
is named Eucraton, whan it is eyther 
hote, colde, drye or moyste. 
 
Somme do vse to iudge the diuersitie 
of complexions, by comparynge 
one distemperate bodye, to an other 
of the same kynde distemperate also, 
as in mannes kinde, Socrates compared 
with Aristotle, is hote, because 
[^f.16r^] 
he is hotter than he, but in respecte 
of Aristippus, he is colde, bycause 
Aristippus is muche hotter, & thus 
one man compared to dyuers, maye 
be bothe hote, colde, drye and moyst: 
And some by comparynge distemperate 
bodyes of dyuers kyndes lerne 
to knowe y=e= constitution, as a dogge 
compared wyth a man is hote, w=t= a 
lyon, is colde, and w=t= a shepe, is drye: 
wyth a pysmyre or a flye is moyste, 
and of thys fashion contraries maye 
be in one bodye, and none otherwise. 
Howe be it (as I thynke) the beste 
waye is to seke out the meane, to the 
whiche al that be of the same kynde, 
ought to be referred, and afterwarde 
as he excedeth in any quality to haue 
his nomination accordyng to y=e= same 
But perchau~ce ye wyl say it is hard 
to fynde in euery kinde a co~plexioned 
body measured by weyght, which is 
the meane, I graunte y=t=, for in dede 
[^f.16v^] 
there was neuer any suche, nor shall 
be, yet as that secte of Philosophers 
whyche were called Stoykes, what 
tyme they defyned a wyse man, dyd 
descrybe suche one, as was not possible 
to be founde any where: and as 
Quintilian descrybeth hys oratour, 
so we, to bryng our purpose aboute, 
muste ymagyne suche an one in oure 
mynde by cogitation, as neuer was 
made, neyther is lyke to be, by consente 
of nature, as thus. In the hole 
kynde of lyuynge thynges, that that 
is moste temperate and perfecte, is 
as a meane to the rest, whych by the 
hole consente as well of the philosofers, 
as of the phisitions, is man, bycause 
any of the other kyndes compared 
wyth hym, is distemperate, than 
yf ye wyll proue man also to be distemperate, 
ye muste seke amongest 
the hole kynde, the most perfecte and 
[^f.17r^] 
temperate: and he that is perfyt and 
temperate, and worthy to be a mene 
to the rest, is neyther ouer thicke, nor 
sclendre, nor very full of heer, nor yet 
smooth and without heer, nor softe, 
nor yet harde, blacke nor whyte, hote 
nor colde, drye nor moyste: and to be 
shorte, kepyng a meane wythout all 
excesse. Yf ye can fynde suche a one in 
the hole kinde, then are ye sure of the 
complexyoned bodye measured by 
weyght, whiche we spake of before. 
In case ye can fynde none suche, ye 
must imagyne a like in your brayne: 
and ye must not do this onely in ma~kynde, 
but also in other naturall and 
lyuely creatures, as wel in the kinde 
of lyons, dogges, elephauntes, and 
wolues: as also of byrdes, fysshes, 
wormes and trees, co~paryng euery 
one in his owne kynde. But in case 
ye wyl fynde what of all thynges is 
[^f.17v^] 
moost temperate: then must ye go agayne 
to the man beforesayd whych 
is neyther hotte nor colde, and the 
skynne in the myddest of the insyde 
of hys hande, is of all thynges most 
temperate. For the temperatest part 
of euery mannes body, is the skynne 
in the myddeste of the paulme of the 
hande: then the temperatest parte of 
the moost temperate man must neades 
be the mooste temperate thynge 
in the worlde, seing that of al lyuyng 
creatures man is moost temperate. 
 
Now that I haue shewed howe by 
comparison made, in euery kinde, the 
differences of the bodye may easelye 
be knowe~, there remayneth behynde 
to declare how to fynde out the same 
wythoute comparison. Where as 
I sayde before, that euery qualitye, 
myght be taken thre dyuerse wayes 
as heate in the hyghest degree, is onlye 
[^f.18r^] 
in the fyre, and in a naturall bodye 
myxt of the Elementes, it is eyther 
referred to an other, by comparison: 
as hotte for hotter, or els it is 
so of nature, whyche maye be taken 
two maner of wayes, as hotte in 
acte or in power. Thynges that be 
hotte in acte, maye easelye be iudged 
by sence of fealynge: for who hathe 
so dull sense in fealynge, that he can 
not perceyue the fyre to be hotte: yf 
he put hys fynger in it. But to know 
whych is hotte in power is a thynge 
of more difficultye. For it can not at 
the fyrst brunt be perceyued by anye 
sence, neyther of fealyng, smellynge, 
hearynge, seinge, nor tastynge. For 
who can perceyue by anye of these, 
y=t= castoreu~, or euphorbiu~ or nasturciu~ 
is hotte, or that Mandragora, Salamandra 
or Papauer is colde. But 
in case ye take any parte of them inwardlye, 
[^f.18v^] 
eyther as meate, drynke, or 
medicine: then ye shal easely discerne 
whiche is hotte and whiche is colde. 
But peraduenture ye wyl condemne 
this profe as noughte, bycause it is 
daungerous medlyng with poyso~s: 
I graunt that, & therfore it is moch 
safer, to laye them as a playster, to 
some vtter part of your skyn, where 
as they can not hurte, and after that 
they haue lyen there a whyle, they 
wyll shewe theyr power and qualitie, 
which shalbe perceyued quycklye 
by sense in felyng. But to iudge thinges 
moyst, or drye, I can shewe you 
a moche surer rule, what soeuer thing 
is soft, and moderately hotte, that of 
nature is moyst: whatsoeuer is harde 
and moderatly hote, y=t= of nature and 
power is drye: and this is alwayes 
true, as well in lyuely bodyes, as in 
other thynges. 
 
[^f.19r^] 
[}The .iiii. Chapter. 
The generation of the liuer, hert, 
and brayne.}] 
 
FOr asmoche as there is nothyng 
so necessary to attayne 
to any perfyte knowledge in 
Phisicke, as to be perfyte bothe in 
cuttyng and in openynge the bodye, 
and partes of the same. And seing it 
is shame for a man ne to be learned 
in so manye artes, and haue knowledge 
of so manye thynges (as the 
mooste parte of men nowe a dayes 
haue) and be ignoraunt in his owne 
bodye, the whych he shoulde mooste 
perfytely knowe: I thynke it no lesse 
then my bounden dutye, to employe 
my laboure and diligence to the furtheraunce 
of the same, that suche as 
be but begynners as yet verye rawe 
in Physycke, whose bryngynge vp 
hath not ben amongest learned men 
[^f.19v^] 
of the vniuersityes, wherby they are 
destitute, bothe of dialecte, naturall 
Philosophye, and other artes, with 
out the which Physycke can hardlye 
be learned, maye haue some helpe by 
this my lytle rude boke, bothe to attayne 
some learnyng in Physycke, & 
also to knowe theyr bodye. Bloode 
and the seed of the man be beginners 
of our generatio~, of the whych blood 
is the substaunce and matter wherof 
our body is made, and the seed of 
man is nexte vnder God, the maker 
and fashyoner of the same, and these 
same be made of the same elementes 
whyche I haue spoken of alreadye, 
whyche is the fyre, ayer, earth, and 
water, and these two dyffer one fro~ 
an other in temperature. For in the 
seede there is more of fyre and eyer 
then of water and earth, and in the 
blood there is lesse of fyre and ayer, 
[^f.20r^] 
then there is of water and earth: and 
yet in the same there is more heate 
then colde, and more moysture then 
drynesse. After that these two be receyued, 
and .vi. dayes retayned w=t=in 
the wombe of the woman, the great 
heate which is there doth so bake the 
seede & blood being mixt togyther, y=t= 
it co~passeth them about w=t= a skyn, or 
a crust, not vnlike the vtter cote of an 
egge, whiche the Grekes call [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
& in latin is called secu~dine, or secu~dina: 
what oure mydwyues call it I can 
not tel: howbeit, it may very well be 
called a skyn wherein is wrapped y=t= 
that is co~ceiued, and this is made in 
y=e= fyrst .vi. dayes, with diuers pulses 
and veynes, as fyne & small as anye 
thredes, whiche serueth afterwarde 
to nourysh the infant by the nauyll. 
For in this same skynne, whiche before 
is called Chorion, there are many 
[^f.20v^] 
fyne holes, moche lyke the lytle holes 
in the small lamparie heedes, by 
the which the nauyll after the seue~th 
daye, doth drawe vnto it both spirite 
and blood, to the nourishment of the 
infant. Then in the meane seaso~ the 
rest of the seede boylynge all hotte, 
doth make thre lytle bladers, which 
is the place of the lyuer, herte, and 
brayne. For a veyne whiche is stretched 
ryght vpwarde from the nauil 
dothe drawe vp the grossed bloode, 
which for lacke of heate easelye congeleth 
in y=e= seede. And there is made 
also a double forked veyne, and to 
one of the forkes of the same veyne 
is fashyoned this forsayde congeled 
blood, which is the liuer: and lyke as 
from the nauyll, the veyne bryngyng 
grosse bloode into the forsayde lytle 
bladder was cause of the generation 
of the liuer, so lykewyse a pulse or an 
[^f.21r^] 
artery bryngyng fyne blood and spirite, 
commynge from the same place, 
sumwhat nere y=e= backe, into another 
lyke bladdar, is cause of makynge of 
the hearte, whyche is made of verye 
sounde fleshe, thycke and grosse, mete 
for suche a pourpose, and of the most 
fyne and subtyle blood, that co~meth 
from the hearte, the lyghtes be made 
and the whole brest also wherin thei 
are closed. In to the thyrde bladdar, 
whyche is mencioned before, a great 
parte of the seede beynge full of spirite, 
is driuen, the whych to kepe him 
selfe moyst, doth drawe a great parte 
of the seede to it, and maketh a lytle 
sell, whiche is the brayne, to y=e= which 
ther is added a fortres of hard bone. 
And thus the brayne, is made of the 
seede only, that he myght be furnysshed 
wyth most fyne spirites, whom 
the brayne conserueth and altereth, 
[^f.21v^] 
the whiche are the cause of sense, and 
voluntarie mouynge, as shall be declared 
more playnely hereafter. 
 
Nexte to the brayne groweth y=e= marye 
of the backebone, whyche the Arabians 
call Nucha, it is of the same 
nature, that the brayne is, and differeth 
very muche from the marye, of 
the other partes. 
 
I haue shewed to you nowe, thoghe 
very rudely, the original begynning 
of mannes body. Of the sede is only 
made all the bones, gristels, veynes, 
pulses, strynges, synowes, tyinges, 
selles and skynnes, whyche be called 
Spermatyke partes, because they be 
made of y=e= seede and not of the blood. 
They are the verye same, whyche I 
sayde before that the Latyne menne 
called Partes similares, and the Phisitions, 
sensible elementes, al the rest 
be made of the bloode, as the lyuer, 
[^f.22r^] 
the hearte, and the lyghtes, wyth al 
the flesshe, and fatte of the bodye. 
 
The infant whyles he is within his 
mothers woumbe, is nourysshed of 
that blood whyche is called Sanguis 
menstruus. drawynge it at hys nauyl, 
and after he is delyuered, it is tourned 
all to mylke, whych is his meat 
long after, and therfore there is manye 
conduytes from the woumbe, to 
the pappes. 
 
After that the infant is fully proportioned, 
& figured, i~ the first monethes 
he pisseth by the conduyte, that commeth 
through his nauyl, in the later 
monethes that is shut vp, and he pysseth 
wyth hys yerde, he auoydeth no 
excrementes at hys fundament, because 
he receyueth no norysshemente 
by hys mouthe. There is a skynne, 
muche lyke a puddynge, whyche receyueth 
[^f.22v^] 
hys vrine and excrementes, 
lest they shulde hurte eyther hym, or 
els hys mother. I shulde seme bothe 
to longe and also to tedious, yf I descrybed 
the hole bodye, but bycause 
the action of the instrumentes, canne 
not be vnderstande, excepte I shulde 
touche y=e= most principal partes, therfore 
it was necessarye to entermedle 
wyth the descryption of the bodye, in 
the whyche I wyll not be so scrupulous, 
as to reherse euery lytle part or 
the scituation or fygure of euery bone 
and vayne, no nor the knyttynge of euery 
muscle, (for why shulde I make 
me more cu~nyng than I am) in dede 
it passeth my learnynge as yet, but I 
entende to shewe, and sette forthe the 
greatest, and moste noble partes, the 
whyche he muste nedes knowe that 
wyll profyt in phisicke. 
 
[^f.23r^] 
[}The .v. Chapiter. 
The sections of the bodye.}] 
 
THere was no nede in y=e= 
olde tyme, to wryte of 
the body, for than children 
were excersised in 
their yonge and tender 
age, daylye in cuttynge and openyng 
of the same, but nowe that thys diligence 
is vtterly extyncte, we haue very 
great nede of wrytynge, wherfore 
I haue taken this lytle payne vppon 
me, whyche I shall thynke wel bestowed, 
yf it shall eyther healpe the studyes 
of those that be rude and rawe 
in physicke, or satisfye them that be 
learned. And fyrst I wyl declare (by 
goddes grace) suche partes as couereth 
the head wythout, & afterwarde 
those that be w=t=in, begynnyng w=t= the 
heares thogh they be but excrementes, 
& superfluities, nexte vnderneth 
[^f.23v^] 
the hear, there is a skynne somwhat 
thycke and fleshye, wherein the hear 
is rooted: vnderneth thys skin, there 
is a lytle flesshe, aboute the browe & 
temples. Than next vnderneth, ther 
is a fyne kell, whyche is made of synowes 
and tyenges, commyng thorowe 
the seames of the scull, whyche 
the Grekes call [^GREEK OMITTED^], vnder the 
whyche immediatly, is the skulle, in 
greke called [^GREEK OMITTED^], & for the defence 
of the brayne, it is made lyke an helmet, 
the latyne men call it Caluariam, 
and it is not one hole continual bone 
but is deuyded by certayne semes in 
to seuen bones. Then within y=e= head 
vndernethe the sculle, is Dura mater, 
which Calen calleth Crassum [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
it is a thycke and harde kel or skinne 
made of many stronge sinowes and 
bondes, to the entent it myght holde 
vp and susteyne the veynes, whyche 
[^f.24r^] 
nouryssheth the brayne: After thys 
is pia mater, whyche is an excedynge 
fyne skynne, made of synowes, not 
onely compassyng the hole substance 
of the brayne, but also penetratyng 
into dyuers partes, that are wythin 
the brayne, & noryssheth it as muche 
as the skynne whyche before we called 
Chorion, doth nouryshe the sede, & 
because it is made of synowes, it gyueth 
sence to the brayne. At the laste 
we be come to the brayne, the which 
whan I consyder that it is made of 
the seede, I can not chose, but maruayle, 
howe all our cogitations & ymaginacions 
shuld come fro~ thence & 
howe the brayne beyng so grosse and 
massye of substance, shuld hang as it 
doth w=t=out any stey or vndersettyng, 
in such holow & wyde places, we se y=e= 
housen be vnderset w=t= postes, or els 
they wold ouerwhelme y=e= floure vnder 
[^f.24v^] 
the~, but the brayne being vnderset 
w=t= nothyng, how fortuneth it, that so 
longe as lyfe remayneth in the body 
it choketh and ouerwhelmeth not the 
wyde holowe chambers vnderneth? 
Whan I dydde depely consyder the 
cause of thys, I thoughte the brayne 
had a certayne similitude of the sky. 
For as the skye beynge a great & heauye 
substance without any proppes, 
or vndersettes, doeth not fall, nor is 
stroken out of hys place: so the brayn 
by a certayne diuine nature y=t= it hath 
doth consist wythout any stay or fortresse 
that can be perceyued by sence, 
and thereof it commeth that man is 
called [^GREEK OMITTED^], whyche we maye 
call in our touge a lytle worlde, & surely 
the bryght spirites which come 
from the brayne to the eye, doeth declare, 
that there is a certayne cognation 
or kynderede betwene the skye, 
[^f.25r^] 
and mannes brayne, whiche though 
it be made of the seede (as I sayd before) 
yet it is some diuine and celestiall 
thynge: yea and the nature of y=e= 
seede is so moche the more to be meruayled 
at: how moche it passeth our 
knowledge and capacitie, to shewe & 
declare the causes whereby it worketh 
suche wonders in the brayne, 
which is ful of holes, as eyes, replenyshed 
with spirite, maye very well 
be the cause why the brayne falleth 
not downe. Howbeit, bothe the substaunce 
of it, and the wonderful motions 
also may better be maruayled 
at, then descrybed. This I dare say, 
that it is made of the fynest parte of 
the seede, and of that, that is fullest 
of spirite, and is deuyded into two 
partys, by that same skynne whych 
before is called Dura mater, y=e= one lyeth 
before and the other behynde. 
 
[^f.25v^] 
That whiche is before, (as it is of 
the finest and moost pure substau~ce) 
so it bryngeth out most fine and subtyle 
synowes, and is the place of reason 
and intelligence: the other (as it 
is course of substaunce) so there groweth 
of it greate and stronge synowes, 
not vnlyke them that growe 
of the mary of the backe bone, and it 
is thought to be the place of memorie: 
now that after a rude fassyon we 
haue descrybed the brayne, there remayneth 
behynde the description of 
his selles, and chambres, whiche in 
numbre be .iii. in the former part of y=e= 
heed, there are .ii. depe holow places, 
not vnlike y=e= figure of the moone whe~ 
she is newe chaunged, and of y=e= bygnesse 
of an egge, reaching downe almost 
to the eares. The same cauities 
(though they be .ii. of them, one on y=e= 
right side & another on y=e= left side) yet 
[^f.26r^] 
for the most part they be called y=e= first 
chaumbre of the brayne, whyche alwaye 
is full of spyrite, hauynge his 
sydes couered, and cladde, wyth the 
same rymme or skynne, whyche before 
is called Pia mater, which is ful 
of veynes and pulses for y=e= nutrime~t 
of the brayne: vnder eche of these cha~bers 
ther is (if I may so cal it) a long 
rope, which is made of veynes & pulses, 
couered w=t= a fine skyn y=t= groweth 
of Pia mater, these small longe ropes 
hath ioyninges, wherby they claspe, 
& be red, moche lyke wormes, wherfore 
they be called wormes, and do 
extende in length as farre as the eares, 
and the myddle chaumbre of the 
brayne, whome they replenysshe 
wyth spirit. In the same place at the 
ende of the first cauities, vnder them 
is an other cauitie. For at the latter 
ende of the forsayd wormes or ropes 
[^f.26v^] 
there are two lumpes, whych of the 
verye similitude of buttockes be called 
Nates, and be cladde w=t= the skyn 
of the wormes which whe~ the sayde 
cauitie or cha~bre: is drawe~ togyther 
do touche one an other, and when it 
is open, they also be seperate. This 
chambre or selle is as bygge as the 
yolke of an egge, and being couered 
rounde about with the brayne, is called 
the myddle cha~bre or sell, whiche 
is shut w=t= a pessule or barre of the bygnesse 
of a lytle walnut, and therfore 
it is called in latyn Glandula or, conarium, 
and it is iust betwyxt the myddell 
chambre, and the entryng into y=e= 
thyrde, his offyce is to sustayne, and 
beare vppe, the veynes and pulses, 
whiche brynge spirite to the myddle 
chambre. The thyrde chambre is behynde 
in the laste parte of the heed, 
whiche before we supposed to be the 
[^f.27r^] 
place and seet, of the memorye, and 
in this chambre is a greate parte of 
the brayne, whiche the Grecians call 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], in latyne it is called Cerebellum: 
in oure tungue we haue no 
propre name for it, whiche I can do 
no lesse then count the negligence of 
our Phisitions to be the cause of: for 
yf they had wrytten of theyr arte in 
theyr mother tunge, as they do in other 
places, why shulde we lacke englysh 
names, more then we lacke eyther 
Latyn names or Greke names? 
and yet to saye the truthe, it is better 
for vs English men to haue English 
names, then eyther Latyn or Greke. 
Of this part of the brayne groweth 
the mary of the backe bone, which is 
called Nucha, vnder the mydle chambre, 
there is an holow cauitie, which 
receyueth the excreme~tes and superfluyties 
of the brayne, the which being 
[^f.27v^] 
turned into spettyll, co~meth oute 
after at the nose, the Grekes cal this 
cauitie [^GREEK OMITTED^], the Latyn men infusorium, 
or infundibulum, we haue no proper 
name for it: howe be it it maye be 
called a droppyng pan. Next vndernethe 
be the iawes, furnyshed wyth 
xxxii. teeth: the foure formost of eche 
syde be called deuiders, bycause they 
teare the meate: the next of eche syde 
be called dogteeth, bycause they be 
lyke tuskes: all the rest in latyn be called 
Genuini, or Molares, which we cal 
gu~mes: and they haue two rootes at 
the leest, where as the other haue but 
one: with those teeth the mouth is co~passed 
rounde aboute, and defended: 
wherein as a precyous Iewell in a 
stronge towre or fortresse, is enclosed 
the tungue, whyche is made of very 
soft and rawe flesh, full of holes and 
[^f.28r^] 
full of pulses, veynes and synowes: 
full of synowes, to the intent it maye 
moue dyuerselye, and also feale and 
taste: full of pulses or arteryes, bycause 
it hath great neade of spyryte, 
and naturall heate, seinge it hath so 
manye dynerse mouynges: and it is 
full of veynes, that it maye be well 
nouryshed. There is also added to it 
a certayne moysture, lest it shoulde 
waxe drye, bycause it is moued dayly: 
aboue y=e= tunge, is a pype, whych 
the Grecyans vse to cal [^GREEK OMITTED^], and 
the Latynistes call it Gulam, the vnlearned 
or ignoraunt call it the wesaunt, 
and it is a longe pype, hauynge 
two skynnes or cootes, the 
whych drawe downe the meate and 
drynke into the mawe or bagge, and 
the vtter cote helpeth the stomacke 
to vomyte. 
 
[^f.28v^] 
There is also in the former parte of 
the necke another pipe, which (to the 
intent that nothyng shoulde go that 
waye, but only ayer) is couered with 
the roote of the tunge, and it is made 
of harde grassels, ioyned togyther 
lyke rynges, and doeth conduct onelye 
ayer and spiryte to the lyghtes, 
and herte, being nothyng so long as 
the other, which draweth meate and 
drynke, downe to the stomacke, or 
mawe, and it hath a great knobbe almooste 
at the ende, nexte the iawe, 
which the grekes cal [^GREEK OMITTED^], in latyn 
Nodus gutturis, which in Englysh is 
the knotte of the throte, & whan so euer 
we swalowe any thyng, it goeth 
vp aboue the iawe. The wynde pype 
is the formoost parte of the necke, to 
the entent it maye take ayer and spiryte 
the easelyer. And the wesaunt or 
meate pype (for why shoulde we be 
[^f.29r^] 
ashamed of these names, seynge we 
haue no better) is put farre wythin 
the necke, because it shulde haue the 
more heat, howebeit we wyl omytte 
to speke of it vntyl suche tyme as the 
lyghtes and hearte, wyth all that is 
contayned in the breaste, whyche the 
Phisitions call the myddle bellye, be 
declared so well as my simple wytte 
and learnyng wyll gyue me leaue. 
 
To the loweste parte of the wynde 
pype, (for it is as well the instrume~t 
of brethynge, as of speakyng) be fastned 
the lyghtes, whych beyng made 
of lyght, and moste subtyle and fyne 
fleshe, not vnlyke the fome of choleryke 
blood congeled, hath the fygure 
of an oxe houfe, clouen in to .ii. partes, 
and doth compasse the hart, rou~d 
about with .v. globes .iii. on the right 
syde, and .ii. on the lyfte. 
 
And loke as the pulses doth conserue 
[^f.29v^] 
and kepe temperat the natural heat, 
thoroweout the hole body, so y=e= lightes 
preserue the hearte from choking 
by the receyuynge of externall ayer, 
whyche least it shulde hurte the hart 
wyth colde commyng sodeynly vpon 
it, is tempered ther before, so that I 
can neuer wonder ynough at y=e= hygh 
and diuine prouidence of god, which 
foreseyng al these thynges, hath constitute 
suche an order in mannes bodye, 
as I dare saye was neuer in any 
publyke weale. For what publycke 
weale, eyther is there, or hathe bene, 
syns the worlde beganne, in whiche 
the subiectes haue bene founde euer 
obedient wythout all grudgynge to 
theyr lorde and prince, were he neuer 
so noble or valiau~t? yet in mans bodye 
though there be infinite subiects 
ther can be founde no disobedience to 
theyr lorde and gouerner, whyche is 
[^f.30r^] 
the hearte: for yf anye poyson be gathered 
there wythin the bodye: or otherwyse, 
whyche wyth hys venym, 
wolde pearse the heart, I praye you 
is not euery parte readye to defende 
him? though it be to the vtter destruction 
of them al for euer? and to say 
truthe, he is worthy to haue no lesse 
homage or seruyce, seyng he is auctor 
of lyfe to al the rest, helpyng his subiectes 
& seruauntes, at al such tymes 
as they be in daunger. 
 
And to the entent that no one parte, 
myght be destitute more of help then 
another, by reason of the distance betwene 
hym and his gouernouer, Nature 
hath prouyded the hart to be set 
so egallye in the middest of the brest, 
as is possyble to be deuysed, by al the 
mathematikes in the worlde, whych 
is compassed aboute wyth a cote, the 
[^f.30v^] 
whych Galen calleth [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
it is made of synowes so thycke, and 
so strong, that it is softer than a bone 
and yet it is sufficient to defende the 
hearte, it is tyed to the skynne which 
couereth the rybbes, and to the mydryfe, 
and the heart strynges, conteynynge 
a lytle quantitie of water that 
neuer dryeth vp, vntyll such tyme as 
lyfe and all naturall heat is departed 
from the bodye: There is also a lytle 
fatte, leaste the hearte thorough hys 
contynual mouynge, shulde be dryed 
vp: wythin thys forsayd cote, is inclosed 
as a mooste precious iuell, the 
heart, hauynge .ii. chambres, one on 
the ryght syde, & an other on the lefte. 
To the chambre on the right side, the 
great mayster vayne, whiche groweth 
on the lyuer, doth brynge blood, 
that is distributed in to .iii. partes, y=e= 
subtylest and moost choleryke, to the 
[^f.31r^] 
nutrimente of lyghtes: The seconde 
parte, is caryed in to the chambre of 
the lyfte syde, where by the vertue of 
the heart, it is formed in to vytal spirite, 
the thyrde and last parte is reserued 
to the nourysshement of the hole 
bodye, after that it hath receyued of 
the hearte bothe vitall heat and spirite. 
And lyke as from the chamber 
of the ryght syde, the greate mayster 
vayne, bryngeth blood thorough the 
hole bodye, so from the least chamber 
the master pulse bryngeth vitall spirite, 
of the whyche the lyuer taketh 
hys power, and facultye, wherby he 
nourysheth the body & brayn, by his 
vertue, by whych he gyueth bothe felyng 
and mouyng to the same. 
 
I wolde not nowe that any manne 
shulde thynke, that I do defende the 
errour of Aristotle, whyche thought 
that the hert, as he is author of lyfe, 
[^f.31v^] 
so to be the gyuer bothe of felynge & 
mouynge, to the hole bodye: for that 
the synowes growe of the brayne, euery 
man hauyng hys syghte, maye 
perceyue easelye, and that they gyue 
bothe felynge and mouyng to the bodye: 
ye may knowe if ye take a dogge 
and tye bothe hys pulses and veynes 
and let hym go, & he shal both feele & 
runne, so long as y=e= animal spirit lasteth, 
whych is all redy in hys synowes, 
but in case ye tye hys synowes, 
he shall not be able to styre one foote. 
Thys is a very manyfest profe, that 
the hearte gyueth not sence and mouynge, 
to the bodye, yet as I sayde 
before, bothe the brayne, and also the 
lyuer, take theyr power of the heart, 
for after that the hearte hath engendered 
vytall spirite, parte is caryed 
to the lyuer, and parte to the brayne. 
[^f.32r^] 
The lyuer of hys, engendreth newe 
spirites, called naturall, the whiche 
he doeth distribute by hys veynes, 
thoroghout the bodye to the nuryshement 
of the same. 
 
The brayne also tourneth those spirites 
whyche he receyued of the hart, 
in to other spirites, called animall & 
these beynge dispersed amongest the 
synowes, is cause bothe of mouyng 
and feelyng. 
 
Sythens that I haue accordyng to 
my promyse made before, declared 
by what meanes the brayne gyueth 
sence and mouynge to the bodye, I 
wyll as bryefelye as I can descrybe 
the residue of the partes, whyche I 
thynke most necessarye to be knowen 
begynnynge there, where as I lefte 
wyth the hearte, whyche besyde hys 
chambres, hath also twoo eares, the 
[^f.32v^] 
whiche be grassels made of synowes 
beynge full of wrynkles and foldynges, 
and they be also called the selles 
or butteries of the hearte. 
 
I promysed before to declare as nere 
as I coulde, those partes y=t= the brest 
whyche is called the myddle bellye, 
doth conteyne, and I haue al redy so 
to my lytle power, descrybed both y=e= 
hearte, the lyghtes & the instrumentes 
of the voyce, and brethyng wyth 
the partes & couerynges, of the same 
therefore nowe there remayneth the 
mydryfe, whyche in latyne is called 
Mediastinus. and the skinne, that compasseth 
the rybbes, whyche in Greke 
is called [^GREEK OMITTED^] & the heart strynges, 
whyche in greke is called [^GREEK OMITTED^]. 
The mydryfe doth deuyde the breast 
al in lengthe, and maketh .ii. cha~bers 
one on the ryghte syde, and an other 
on the lefte syde: And because it is a 
[^f.33r^] 
very stronge skynne, it doth fashyon 
both veynes, pulses and synowes to 
the brest, and it is tyed before to the 
brestbone, and behynde to the ioyntes 
of the backebone. The seconde 
skynne is that, that is called [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
which couereth the rybbes on the insyde, 
and the muscles also that be betwyxt 
the rybbes. Next vndernethe 
this is [^GREEK OMITTED^], which the Latyne 
men call Transuersum septu~, or p~cordia: 
we may cal it an ouerthwart bridge 
or the hertstrynges, it is made of synowes 
& fleshe, couered with .ii. fyne 
rymes, made to moue the lyghtes, & 
also to drawe in and let out ayer, and 
to separate the lowest belly from the 
mydle bely, vnderneth the hertstrynges, 
somwhat toward the ryght side 
the mawe or paunche, whiche before 
we called the lowest bellye, beinge 
rounde, with a greate bottome, and 
[^f.33v^] 
somthyng narowe towarde the left 
syde is fastened to the .xiii. ioynte of 
the backe bone, and in the same place 
the wesau~t that before we called the 
stomake, is tyed to the mawe, whych 
hath .ii. mouthes, one at the lowest 
parte of the wesaunt, and the other 
in the ryght syde of y=e= mawe or pa~che 
The mouth by the which the meate 
is receyued into the mawe, doth shut 
the nether parte of the wesaunt, and 
is called, the hyther mouthe of the 
mawe: the mouthe that letteth oute 
the meate, shytteth the nether parte 
of the mawe, and is called in Greke 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], in Latyne Ianitor, in our tung 
a portar or a keper of the gate, and 
bothe these mouthes (to the intente 
that the meate and drynke maye not 
fall oute at any tyme vnconcocte) be 
set in the syde of the belly or panche, 
which be fast shutte as soone as euer 
[^f.34r^] 
the bellye hath receyued meate, and 
therby naturall heate is very moche 
encreased wythin the mawe, beynge 
made of synowes and of flesshe, and 
it hath also two cootes, of the whych 
the innermoost, hath more synowes 
then flesshe, and it is very thycke and 
rough, ful of wryncles, by the which 
the meate is drawen downe and retayned. 
The vtter cote is more flesh, 
and serueth onely to expell that, that 
the bely refuseth and hath done w=t=al. 
The temperature of the belly is cold 
and drye, accordyng to the nature of 
synowes, wherof it hath abu~daunce 
that it may be delyted w=t= such thi~ges 
as be co~uenie~t & mete for it, and may 
abhorre suche as be noyful & hurtful 
vnto it. I haue spoken somewhat 
brefely of the bellye and mawe, but 
before we descrybe the liuer, I wyll 
first reherse .ii. cotes or coueringes of 
[^f.34v^] 
the bely, which (nature by her diuine 
and hygh sapie~ce) hath prouyded for 
the defence of the belly and entrailes 
The fyrst coueryng is called iu latyn 
Omentu~, y=e= Grecians do cal it [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
our bouchers call it the kell, and it is 
wouen lyke a nette, of veynes, pulses 
and senowes, beinge couered with a 
great deale of fatte, to the intent that 
it maye holde in, the naturall heate, 
which is in the mawe and guttes, for 
it couereth all the belly from the top 
to the too, the next cote or couerynge 
the Grekes call [^GREEK OMITTED^], whiche couereth 
not onelye the bellye, but also 
the liuer, mylte, and reynes, & it groweth 
of the bladder, being thycker in 
some place then in some, it tyeth the 
lowest partes of the belly to y=e= backe, 
and doth sustayne the muscles of the 
belly, which the Latyn men cal Musculos 
abdominis, vpon the which muscules 
[^f.35r^] 
is a great deale of fatte, & then 
the skynne that couereth the whole 
body. Next vnto the mawe, immediatly 
downewarde be the guttes and 
entrayles, the whiche although they 
be all one whole and continual body 
yet they maye be decerned bothe by 
theyr figure, situation, and action. 
 
The fyrst, whyche is fastened to the 
nether mouth of the mawe, is called 
Duodenum, bycause it is .xii. ynches 
longe, and it is in the ryght syde, in 
the region of the lyuer. Nexte vnto 
Duodenum is Ieiunium, whiche is so 
called bycause it is alwayes emptye. 
For to this gutte there co~meth moch 
choler from the lyuer, and bycause it 
of all the rest is nexte the liuer: therfore 
the lyuer draweth from it verye 
quycklye by hys small veynes, suche 
iuise as came from the stomake before. 
And from this gutte there commeth 
[^f.35v^] 
choler into the rest, to expell the 
excrementes. The nexte is called of 
Galene [^GREEK OMITTED^], whyche hath manye 
circuites and boughtes, bycause it 
shulde retayne the iuyce longer, and 
it doth farre passe all the rest: ioyned 
vnto thys, is the gutte called Cecum, 
whych doth receyue the excrementes 
and it is called Saccus, bycause it is 
the wydest of all. Then foloweth 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], beynge two cubytes of length, 
hauyng dyuerse boughtes. and compassynges, 
lest the excrement shulde 
fall strayte out: and in this gutte the 
excrement taketh hys coloure. The 
last gutte whiche we call the fundament 
begynneth vnder the left reyne 
and is stretched downe euen to the 
very hole in the tayle: it is tyed to the 
great back bone, being large & wyde 
to the intent that the excrement may 
go down more at ease. Sith I haue 
[^f.36r^] 
descrybed the guttes & entrayles, I 
wyll adde somthyng as co~cernyng y=e= 
matter that they be made of. They be 
made of flesh & sinowes, haui~g brode 
stri~ges, by y=e= which they expel the excrementes. 
There is a certayne skyn 
mixt amongest the guttes, which is 
no gutte but a fortresse or a stay for y=e= 
smal veynes which come fro~ y=e= lyuer 
and it is called in Greke [^GREEK OMITTED^], & 
thervpon al the small veynes be called 
Mesaraice, and it is a fyne and subtyle 
skyn, made of very smal veynes 
gathered on an heape togyther, amo~gest 
the whyche there is a lumpe of 
fleshe, lyke vnto a kernell, whiche we 
call the swyt bread. Underneth y=e= bastard 
ribbes in y=e= right side of y=e= maw 
or stomake is y=e= liuer, whose substa~ce 
is red flesh, not moch vnlike co~geled 
blood beinge replenished w=t= veynes, 
which be y=e= brau~ches of y=e= great master 
[^f.36v^] 
veynes, y=t= is of y=e= veyne which is 
called Porta, & also of y=t=, that is called 
Caua vena, we haue no names in our 
tungue whych be propre or peculier 
to them onely, but muste be fayne to 
call them master veynes, and in dede 
so that we vnderstande the thynge, 
it shall make but lytle matter for names: 
howbeit Gallen sayth, that the 
one is called Porta, bycause that the 
iuyce commeth through it, from the 
stomake to the liuer: and the other 
I thynke is called Caua, bycause it is 
a great hollowe veyne, well what so 
euer it be called, it groweth of the liner, 
and carieth blood from the liuer 
to the hert, and thoughe it to be byg: 
yet there groweth many fyne & smal 
veynes, both of it, and of the other, 
whych be dispersed throughout the 
whole body of the liuer, to the intent 
that the iuice maye more easelye be 
[^f.37r^] 
turned into blood: for the very dutye 
and office of the lyuer, is to engendre 
blood, for the nouryshmente of y=e= bodye, 
and therfore it is hote and moyst 
accordynge to the nature of blood. 
 
Moreouer it is the very fleshe of the 
lyuer, whyche doth change the iuyce 
in to blood, makyng it redde lyke vnto 
it selfe. Althogh that su~me thynke 
the harte to be the well, and original 
sprynge of blood, notwythstandyng 
I had rather saye as Galene sayeth, 
that it is the fleshe of the liuer, which 
engendreth blood, althogh the lyuer 
receyue both vytall heat, and spiryte 
of the hearte, and therefore from the 
great master pulse, whyche in greke 
is called [^GREEK OMITTED^], there commeth manye 
lytle pulses to the lyuer, bryngynge 
w=t= them vitall spirite, but so sone as 
y=e= iuyce is concocte, it is made blood, 
and purified in y=e= middes of the lyuer 
[^f.37v^] 
And as in the most pure wyne, there 
is alwayes besyde the substaunce of 
the wyne, certayne superfluities and 
dregges the which for their weyght 
falleth to the bottom, & ther is su~methynges 
also, that boyleth vpwarde, 
because it is lyght, and of the nature 
of the ayer, which is called y=e= flour of 
the wyne, so in the blood, after y=e= lyuer 
hath purified it, there is certayne 
dregges called melancholy or blacke 
choler, which falleth to the bottom, & 
is receyued strayt, by a certen co~duite 
and caried to the milte or splen being 
on y=e= lyfte syde of the stomake, which 
nature hath ordeyned to be a receptacle 
for the same, and moreouer there 
is another excreme~t which swi~meth 
aboue the bryncke, because it is lyke 
& of the nature of the fyer, called yealowe 
choler, which (because if shulde 
not hurte the bodye, throgh his fyrie 
[^f.38r^] 
heat and sharpenes) is receyued in a 
bladdar that lurketh vndernethe the 
myddle clobe of the lyuer. After all 
thys yet there remayneth a certayne 
watrye substance wyth the blood, to 
the entent, that parte of it may be co~cocte, 
and tourned in to bloode, afterwarde, 
and parte of it may make the 
blood thinner, that it maye runne the 
easelyer throughe the small and fyne 
veynes, that be in the lyuer, & maye 
also mitigate the feruent heat of the 
blood: But afterward that the blood 
is ones distributed into the mayster 
veyne, than the raynes draweth the 
watrye substance from it, which afterwarde 
is the vrine. I sayd before 
that vnderneth the myddle globe of 
y=e= lyuer (for in dede it hath .v. wherw=t= 
he embraceth the stomake on y=e= right 
syde) there was hyd y=e= blader of y=e= gal 
or choler, whyche by a long conduyt 
[^f.38v^] 
receyueth choler, of the smal veynes, 
in the middes of the lyuer, whyle the 
blood is purifyinge and cleansynge, 
whyche conduyte or waye, yf it fortune 
to be stopped, by anye maner of 
chaunce, so that the choler can not be 
seperate from the bloode, then there 
foloweth hote fyeuers, or els the yelowe 
Iandies. 
 
On the lyfte side, the splene or mylte 
enbraseth the stomacke, which being 
blacke of colour, is made of subtyle & 
rare flesshe, and is the same, whyche 
before is called the receptacle of melancholie, 
it is tyed vnto the backe aboute 
the myddes of the bastard ryb 
and doth drawe vnto it melancholye 
or blacke choler, by a veyne whyche 
commeth from the lyuer, receyuyng 
heat of the heart, to digest the forsaid 
blacke choler, by certayne pulses annexed 
vnto it. From the mylte also 
[^f.39r^] 
there is a conduyt to the vppermoste 
mouthe of the stomacke, bryngynge 
melancholye thyther, partly to draw 
togyther the mouthe of the stomake, 
and partlye to prouoke appetyte. 
 
There be .ii. kydneys that be called in 
latyne .Renes, of the whych one is set 
vnderneth the lyuer toward y=e= backe 
and the other is set on the other syde, 
ryght agaynst y=e= mylte, they be made 
of soude and thycke flesshe, least they 
shulde be dissolued of the water, that 
they drawe dayly from the blood, by 
two veynes, whyche be called Mulgentes, 
and in oure tongue, suckynge 
veynes, there is drawen also, besyde 
the water, su~me blood to the noryshment 
of the reynes or kydnies, in the 
myddes of the whyche there is as it 
were a lytle pa~ne, into the which the 
forsayde kydnies doe sweat oute the 
water, whych they receyued of y=e= suckynge 
[^f.39v^] 
veynes, and in thys panne the 
vryne taketh his colour, from whe~s 
it is brought doune, after the concoction 
had ther before, by certayne conduites 
that be called [^GREEK OMITTED^] in greke 
and in latyne, Urinarii, we maye calle 
them the conduytes of the vryne, fro~ 
the raynes to the bladdar. The bladdar 
in man ioyneth to the taylegutte 
or fundiment, from whens the necke 
of it recheth to the yarde, but in wemen 
it is set vpon the mouth of theyr 
woumbe, & therfore they haue bothe 
shorter and wyder necked bladdars 
than men haue, and also be lesse disesed 
w=t= stone in that place, It is made 
of skynnye synowes, and there cummeth 
to it, bothe veynes and pulses. 
the necke onely is of flesshe, and hath 
certayne turnynges and boughtes, 
that it maye houlde the water more 
[^f.40r^] 
easely, there is added a muscle to the 
mouth of the bladder, to the entent y=t= 
we maye eyther let out or retayne the 
water, at our owne wyll & pleasure. 
But howe smal and fine the holes be 
by the whyche the water is receyued 
into the bladder maye easelye be perceyued, 
because that whan it is taken 
out of any dede bodye, that there appeareth 
none at all, more than that, 
whiche is in the necke, to let oute the 
vrine or water. 
 
Manne surelye hath great profitte of 
the bladar, for if that same superfluouse 
water, shoulde not be caryed awaye, 
but be permitted to runne togyther 
in the vaynes, with the blood 
after that the bodye were ones fulle, 
mooste parte of the membres shulde 
cracke, and breake and man shoulde 
be suffocated or choked. 
 
[^f.40v^] 
Therefore the bladder is made for 
thys pourpose, to receyue the superfluous 
watry substance of the blood 
and reteyne it so longe, vntyl the due 
tyme of lettynge of it out, be come. 
 
Nowe I haue descrybed all y=e= partes 
of the lowest bellye, so well as I 
coulde, sauyng the priuy partes both 
of man and woman, whyche for dyuers 
causes I wylle omytte at thys 
tyme, fyrste because I wyll gyue no 
occasion to youth of wanto~nes, and 
then that I wyll offende no honeste 
eares, in descrybynge them playnlye 
and seyng my promyse was to tuche 
but certayne partes, I thinke I may 
as wel omyt them, as a great many 
that I haue spoken nothyng of.
