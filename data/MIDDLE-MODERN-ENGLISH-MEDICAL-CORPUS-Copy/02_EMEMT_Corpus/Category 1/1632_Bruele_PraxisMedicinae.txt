[}A method seruing for the knowledge 
of the HEAD-ACHE; 
called in Latine 
Cephalagia.}] 
 
THe Head-ache is a painefull griefe of the 
head, by reason of some dangerous and 
sad change thereof. This name is giuen 
to it, eyther in regard of the effect it worketh, 
as also in regard of the part affected. 
And it so happens, that the head is more 
tormented with paine then any other part of the body: 
which is partly caused by the location of the head; for 
sharpe vapors, and swelling humours ascending from the 
lower Parts, doe assault the head, partly because the braine 
is of a cold and moyst temperature, superfluity of excrements 
[^p.2^] 
are therein generated, which if they increase, and be 
not auoyded by the expulsiue faculty in their due season, are 
wont to disturbe the head with aches. This payne is sometime 
outward, and then the haires of the head feele a kinde 
of smarting paine, which is not vsuall if the paines bee inward. 
If this paine hath beene of long time, and often come 
vpon the patient, and continues long, and runnes ouer the 
whole head, or the greater part of the head; it is called in 
Latine Cephalea, if onely one side of the head bee affected, it 
is called by the Latines Hemicranea; and this hath his beginning 
from the lower parts, but Cephalea is caused by the 
heads peculiar and principall affect: and as these two kinds, 
so likewise the Headache occasioned by an ague, or by quaffing, 
or by some other externall cause, is called generally by 
the Latines Cephalagia. 
 
[}The part affected.}] 
 
The filmes of the braine are very much troubled with 
this paine, which by reason of their tendernesse, euen the 
least paines are sharpe and irksome to them. But the substance 
of the braine is somewhat grosser, so that the paine 
that doth seaze thereon, is farre duller, and more loading. 
This paine when it doth trouble the braine, hath a double 
cause, the first from it selfe, and then the paine is of longer 
continuance, the second proceeds from the lower parts, 
from which light humors doe ascend, and are easily entertained 
by the braine. Most commonly the cause proceedes 
from the stomacke, by reason of the sixe couple of sinews 
neere adioyning thereto, and then the paine is not so durable, 
but doth rather goe away and returne againe, hauing 
giuen ouer for a time: and euen as the stomacke doth abound 
with ill humors, so the braine doth likewise abound 
therewith. This paine is somewhat mitigated after the 
patient hath eaten, and exasperated by too much fasting: for 
the stomacke being empty, raw and sharpe humors are 
therein resident, which come from the neighbouring parts, 
and the braine doth partake of these vapours: oftentimes 
[^p.3^] 
the fault is in the womb, and then the paine is chiefly in the 
hinder part of the head, for then the paine is conueyed thither 
thorow the marrow of the backe-bone. Sometimes it 
spreads it selfe ouer the whole head, which is caused by 
the corruption of the seede, and suppression of the monthly 
tearmes. If the paine doe proceed from any other cause, 
it may be discerned by his proper signes. Vsually the braine 
being corrupted by other parts, at the length the cause of 
its paine may bee sayd to come from the essence of the 
braine; and it so happens, that the braine being weakened by 
the long continuance of paine, that it will with ease admit of 
the superfluities of the other parts; hence is it that the spirits 
are dissolued, the digestiue faculty, weakened, and the 
temperature of the whole body changed, which is the 
cause that so many excrements are generated in the braine. 
(The Signes.) This disease is knowne by the patients 
complaints and answeres. 
 
[}The Causes.}] 
 
Sometime it is caused by a cold and phlegmy matter, and 
then the paine is duller and more vehement if it surprize 
them suddenly; withall there is palenesse in the face, moyst 
and cold meats was his former diet, whereby his temperature 
is become moyst and cold: vsually this matter by reason 
of his grossenesse and slyminesse, doth stop the narrow 
passages of the head, thereby causing paine: another while 
it is caused by the plenty of blood, and fulnesse of the whole 
body, which are manifested by the patients diet, temperature, 
age, state and condition of the Heauens, and many other 
things which do increase blood. Againe, it is caused by 
the stopping of the monthly termes, or hemeroyds, as also 
of the blood at the nose, which vsually doth gush out at 
its proper seasons, and then the paine is in the forehead for 
the most part. The vrine is of an high colour, and rednesse 
sitteth vpon the face and about the eyes. Another while it 
is caused by thinne and cholericke blood, whereof a small 
quantity doth breede great paine, not so dull as the former, 
[^p.4^] 
but sharpe and piercing, vehemently beating, and gnawing, 
chiefly on the right side of the head; bitternesse in the 
mouth; want of sleepe, and extreme heate of the head doe 
accompany the former symptomes: another while it is 
caused by the superfluity of spirits, or by too much windy 
matter, which will pierce thorow the narrowest passages, 
and will wind it selfe by degrees, thorow the veines, the 
fylmes, arteries, and sinews, and sometimes within the 
fylmes and bones, that so by dispercing it selfe thorow all 
parts, it may make a separation betweene those that are 
most vnited, and then the paine doth runne ouer the whole 
head without any dulnesse, but with a certaine ringing in 
the eares, which at certaine houres of the day, returnes into 
its cauernes. This may bee sayd to come by the consent 
of the other parts. Otherwise this paine of the head is 
caused by some great distemper, eyther hot or cold, and yet 
they are not so durable that onely come by a distemper; 
onely plenty of humors are thereby gathered; and this doth 
happen, if the paine last long, and the body bee full, or ill 
iuyced. The paine that comes by a hot distemper, is more 
vehement then that which comes by a cold distemper: A 
great burning in the head, and rednesse about the eyes, accompany 
this paine, which is eased by the applying of 
moyst things. On the contrary, the paine that is caused 
by a cold distemper, is strong and doth last longer then the 
former. Paines caused by too much drinesse that distemper 
the body, are not so strong, because they come not suddenly, 
but as it is slow in comming, so it is very slow in leauing 
them; heere heate doth not much trouble the head, but 
the skinne of the head is somewhat dry. Moyst medicines 
ease this paine; and dry, very much increase it: moystnesse 
cannot properly bee sayd to bee the cause of paine in the 
head, because it cannot make a violent and sudden change 
in the similar parts, nor breake the closenesse of these parts, 
vnlesse plenty of humors doe concurre. 
 
[^p.5^] 
[}The Prognostiques.}] 
 
An old paine, caused by a cold matter, is hardly to bee 
cured; especially in old men: but a Head-ache continually 
vexing, and depriuing the patient of rest, is not without 
danger; for it is the forerunner of madnesse, especially if 
his vomit appeare somewhat rusty. Likewise a head-ache, 
if it pinch sore, and by curing doth not mend, but rather 
is augmented, doth presage Deafenesse, Phrensie, Impostumes, 
Conuulsion; if the head be greatly pained, and withall 
the sinews stretched, great danger is at hand: if a head-ache 
doe suddenly surprize a man, and hee become mute 
therewith, and snort in his sleepe, he cannot outliue seuen 
dayes, except a feauer in the meane space take hold of him. 
When the head akes, in any part, or the whole head bee 
paind, if snot, water, or blood, come out of the nose, mouth, 
or eare of the patient, the danger is then past: the headache 
also that was not from the beginning, is a sure token of 
a future Crisis eyther by vomiting, or bleeding at the nose, 
and no cure must be attempted for that paine, lest we stop 
the bleeding which is by natures forecast intended, and 
it will eyther quite free them from the disease, or at the 
least ease them. 
 
[}A method seruing for the cure of the cold Headache.}] 
 
IT is effected by these kinds of remedies following. Let 
the aire bee hot and dry, either by art or nature, let his 
meate bee of Hens, Capons, Birds of mountaines, reare egs, 
rost flesh better then boyld; with his meate boyle Betony, 
Maioram, Serpillum, amongst fruits, sweet Almonds, Pistacium, 
Raisins are good: after meate let him take a little Diacidonites, 
with the spices. Let his drinke bee weake Wine, 
and a little quantity of strong Wine may bee tolerated. 
Sometimes hee may drinke a draught of Muskadell, with a 
little Nutmeg and Pepper. Let not his motion and exercise 
be too violent. Let his sleepe be moderate: let him lie with 
his head raysed vp, and somewhat couered. He must auoyd 
[^p.6^] 
vomiting, vnlesse the head doe ake by the consent of the 
stomacke. Let euill affections of the mind bee auoyded; 
but slight thoughts are not heere so hurtfull as in the cholericke 
Cephalea. [/1./] Sirupe of Isope, of Acorus, of Betony, of 
Mel rosatum, of Stæchas, the sirupe of Acetosus Simplex, 
Oxymel Simplex, Squilliticum and Compositum, the Water 
of Hysop, Betony, Maioram, Sage, Parsely, the decoction of 
Wood Guaiacum with capitall things, the decoction of 
Betony, Sage, Hysope, Fenill, Smallage, Maiorame, Parsely, 
Pennyroyall, the decoction of the flowers of Stæchas with 
hony. The cause of the disease will be many dayes digested 
before it be cleane rooted out; for grosse, viscous and slymy 
humors do nourish a more grieuous and rebellious disease. 
Yet if the patient bee vnreasonably afflicted, then shall euacuation 
bee attempted, not expecting a perfect concoction. 
 
[/2./] A veine shalbe opened, if the body bee full, but in grosse, 
viscous and cold humors, a veine shall not bee opened: for 
it is to be feared, that the disease being of its owne nature 
cold, should by that meanes increase. But if any veine 
be opened, that of the right arme shall be opened; and if the 
disease continue after that, we will open a veine in the forehead, 
especially if the paine bee in the hinder part of the 
head: & because the humors are grosse, a large wound shall 
be made. Electuarium Indum, Diactholium, Diaphænicum, 
the powder of prepared Sene is of a great force, Hiera 
Simplex, Diacolocynthidos, Logodali of Agaricke made into

Violets, of Buglosse, Polipody, Sene, Nutmegge, Cynamon, 
Diaphænicum, a decoction of Guaiacum Wood with capitall 
things, Sene, Polipody, a clyster of the decoction of 
Betony, Maioram, Stæchas, leaues of Mellilote, Mallows, 
Colewort: to these adde some Melrosatum, Diaphenium, 
Oyle of Roses, Salt, Hiera, Diacolocynthidos: it is requisite 
[^p.7^] 
for such that are sicke of this disease, to purge not once, but 
twice or thrice: for by such purging, the humours by degrees 
are mastered by the medicines; for grosse and tough 
humours will not bee expelled by a sudden purgation. Pils 
are more preualent then electuaries in this disease, because 
they haue a more attractiue power, and can draw ill humours, 
euen from the most remote parts of the body. 
 
[}Auerters.}] 
 
Wee will vse that which was prescribed in the former 
clyster, in steade of a purging medicine, for therewith shal 
we draw backe the matter downeward, and shall asswage 
the paine which is stirred vp by the vapours carried to the 
head, by reason of costiuenes. Let a veine be opened, the legs 
washed in hot water, Horseleeches shall be applied to those 
veines which swell about the part affected: or to the end 
of the nose, strong suppositors, painefull ligatures of the 
opposite parts, as also strong frictions of those parts, fomentations 
likewise, with the decoction of Sage, Hysope, 
Maioram, and other capitall herbes: a sneeze of bastard 
Pellitory, Pepper, Oyle of Beuers stones, of Pepper-wort,

Lingwort, Euforbij, Bastard-Pellitory, Oyle of Beauer 
stones, Hoggs-bread, Mustard-seed, water of Maioram. 
An Apophlegmatisme, by chewing of Hysope, of conserued 
Pellitory, Pepper, Staues-acre, Licorice, Mastique, Raisins, 
Maioram, with a little Honey, a Gargarisme of red 
Wine, wherein boyle the rootes of Pellitory, of Liquorice, 
leaues of Hysope, of Betony, mustard, and a little Mel rosatum: 
all turnings aside are very conuenient by what cause 
soeuer the malady is cherished. Gargarismes and apophlegmatismes 
are to be vsed, not without great care & circumspection: 
for if the patient bee subiect to the disease of the 
lungs, or be very rheumatick, they may proue hurtfull. But 
we will begin with the neerer parts, and by degrees proceede 
[^p.8^] 
to those that are remote. Diacuminum, Aurea Alexandrina,

Maioram, Betony, Rosemary, Conserue of Rosemary Flowers, 
Aorus conserued, the decoction of the Wood Guaiacum 
with the Flowers of Larduus Benedictus, are medicinable 
as well for the Cephalea, as Hemicranea; Cubebs, 
Musk, Maioram, Ambre, Nutmegge, Cinamon, An epitheme 
for the forehead of the liquor of Wine distilled, 
washing the head with lye wherein Betony and Maioram 
leaues, Flowers of Mellilote and Cammomill for some 
few howres haue beene infused. Irrhigations of the head 
with the decoction of Bay-leaues, Betony, Maioram, Mellilote 
Flowers; Pepper-Baths doe very much comfort 
headaches. An odoriferous ball of Cynamon, Cloues, Stæchas, 
Bay-leaues, Maioram, Mastik, Nutmeg, an oyntment of 
the Oyle of Flower-de-luce, Oyle of Rew, of Lillies, of Annis 
seed, of Camomill, wherewith anoynt the forehead & nosethrill 
holes; emplaysters made of the Root of wild Cucumber 
with Wormewood; a cerate of Euphorbium: this is an 
approued medicine by the ancient Physician, for an old head-ache. 
These medicines do very much strengthen the braine, 
by taking away cold distempers, and then are they of greatest 
force, when the stomacke is empty. This is likewise 
the fittest time to apply outward remedies, otherwise 
they doe draw vapours from the lower parts: but when 
the disease doth beginne to decline, digestiue and strengthning 
remedies may be applied.

[}An appendix or addition seruing for the cure 
of cold HEAD-ACHE.}] 
 
FIrst of all the belly must be purged with a clyster, if the 
matter of the disease be tough, and viscous; it may be 
made subiect to nature by sharpe medicines, afterwards 
the other humors may bee expelled, when their course is 
turned from the head. Which being done, the head may be 
strengthned, and the reliques destroyed, which is easily 
brought to passe by the former medicines, if vniuersals be 
in right manner sorted with particulars: and here is to bee 
noted, that the former medicines may serue eyther for the 
Cephalea or Hemicranea. Sometime they may bee made 
stronger, but specially such medicines as are locall, because 
then the mischiefe is most rebellious. Amongst the other 
diseases of the head-ache, eyther an actuall or potentiall 
caution may doe some good. The head-ache which is caused 
by the French poxe, we will handle in his peculiar place. 
If the paine happen by a feauer, that shall first bee cured; 
if by staying too long in the sunne, mixe oyle of Roses, and 
Vineger, as also Rosewater, wherein dippe a linnen cloth, 
and apply it to the head. Let the patient sleepe without 
disturbance. 
 
[}A method seruing for the knowledge of the PALSEY 
or PARALISIS.}] 
 
A Palsey is a depriuing of sence and motion, not of the 
whole body, as in an Apoplexy, but when one side 
or all parts of the body vnder the head, or any other limbe 
is depriued of sence and motion, as Iaw, Tongue, Eye, 
Foote, Hand, Arme, Lippe. It also fals out that some part 
is depriued of the sensitiue faculty, the motiue faculty not 
being hurt; and contrarywise the motion dies, when as 
the sensitiue faculty remaines sound. Sometimes it happens, 
that neyther sense nor motion is quite taken away, 
[^p.13^] 
but onely waxeth dull, and is numbd. Physicians call this 
an imperfect Palsey, and the harbenger of a Palsey. And 
seeing that motion and sense is diuided but by one sinew, 
it doth so chance, that the motion is taken away, when as 
the sence remaines: because hard sinews are grafted in 
the limbes, which if they suffer but a small paine, presently 
feele it; because to the perfection of sense, a small 
portion of the sensitiue faculty is suffiicient; for the sense 
of feeling doth rather seeme to suffer, then to bee an agent. 
But to the perfection of motion, great store of animall 
faculty is required, whereby small hurt will sooner 
destroy the motion, then the sense. But why the sense doth 
sometime perish, and motion abids, this happens, because 
some parts doe participate of a twofold kinde of sinews. 
This mischiefe hath great affinity with the Apoplexy, and 
sometime is caused by a weake Apoplexy; and then it is 
called Paraplexia; and herein they differ; the Apoplexy 
seizeth vpon all parts of the body, depriuing them both 
of sense and motion; the Palsey seldome or neuer leaues 
the head without motion or sense, but the other parts 
of the body loose both motion and sense, and after a different 
manner: for if the beginning of the marrow of the 
back-bone bee affected, all parts vnder the face doe simphatize 
with it: if but one halfe of the backe-bone be affected, 
all parts hauing relation to that side, suffer in like manner. 
But if the before mentioned parts are not hurt, but 
some particular sinew of some part of the body is loosed, 
that part whereof this nerue is ioyned, shall likewise loose 
sense and motion. 
 
[}The part affected.}] 
 
The beginning of the marrow of the backe-bone, which 
is the originall of all other sinews, is more grieuously annoyd 
then the braine; and then the face being vnhurt, all 
parts vnder the head are hurt: sometime it doth take hold 
on the left, or right side of the marrow of the backe-bone, 
[^p.14^] 
whereby the right or left side of the body is destitute of 
motion and sense, because the marrow of the backe-bone, 
euen as the braine, is deuided into two parts throughout 
the wholelength of the backe-bone, whereby the sinewes 
on the right side, are separated from those of 
the left by a certaine filme, though very obscure, and so 
thereafter as the stopping of the sinews is in the right side 
or left, or both, the Palsey in like manner will seaze on 
the right, or left side, or the whole body. Sometime the 
braine is affected, but not the whole substance of the brain, 
for then an apoplexy would be caused, but the right or left 
side of the braine, and then that part of the face as also 
that side of the body, whether right or left, doth suffer with 
the braine, and when as any part of the face is bereft of 
sense and motion, the rising of the sinews, from the third 
coniugation of the braine, are affected. Sometime one part 
of the body is voyd of sense and motion; which is caused 
by the resolution of a sinew comming from the braine, or 
from some part of the marrow of the backe-bone, from 
which, the part affected doth take sense and motion. 
Wherefore we ought to take paines in the Anatomy, that 
wee may know where this mischiefe keepes its first residence, 
as also the distributions of the sinews, and 
from what part of the marrow of the backe-bone, euery 
part hath its sinews. For this is an affect, belonging to 
the offended action of the animall faculties, sensitiue, and 
motiue. 
 
[}The Signes.}] 
 
The palsied part, if it bee lifted vp, falleth backe againe; 
it is soone coole, and in time withers; their vrine for the 
most part is white, and sometimes inclining to rednesse, 
by reason of the great paine in the Kidneys, or because 
they cannot separate blood from the whayish moisture, by 
reason of their weaknes; if one side be affected, that is cold, 
the other hot, and the eye of the affected side is abated; 
if the iaw, or any other part of the face bee seazed on by 
[^p.15^] 
the Palsey, it is wrested toward the contrary sound part. 
In this mischiefe, sense perisheth, the motion being perfect: 
sometime motion is taken away, and sense doth remaine: 
oftentimes both are gone, and then this mischiefe 
is at his full height, the pulse is faint, slow, little, and 
soft. 
 
[}The causes.}] 
 
It is caused by a cold and moist distemper, sometime by 
an impostume, or some other tumor crushing the sinews, or 
marrow; also it is caused by a wound, a fall, a fracture, too 
straight a ligature, luxation of bones in the backe by a 
stroke; but it is caused for the most part by thin and waterish 
humors, deriued from the braine, which doe insinuate 
into the pores and substance of the sinews, and so 
the sinews being made too soft, are loosned and slackned, 
and doe sucke in so much moysture, that they stop the 
head of the sinews, whereby the passage of the animall 
Faculty is hindered: which hath his originall from the 
braine, as from its first originall, and like a sunne-beame, 
doth thence breake forth, and is spread abroad in the lower 
parts, and distributes both sense and motion to those parts; 
when a part is bereft of the animall Spirits, it falleth down as 
though it were withered, and is immoueable: hereof this 
shall be a signe, that it comes suddenly. But if any part, by 
reason of great abundance of thinne humors doe swell very 
much, then will follow a conuulsion in that part. It is also 
as often caused by grosse humors, which being driuen vpon 
the sinews, doe cause obstructions, and oftentimes such, 
that the passage of the animall Spirits is stopped: which 
is the reason of the sinews withering and falling. It is sometime 
caused by grosse Spirits, because they haue some euill 
quality, ayther hid, or apparent. 
 
[}Prognostiques.}] 
 
A Palsey which is caused by the cutting of a sinew ouerthwart, 
is incurable. A Palsey is oftner caused in the winter; 
and in old men is neuer, or hardly cured; because natiue 
[^p.16^] 
heate is deficient in them, whereby, cold, and grosse 
humours are generated in them: the Palsey which is onely 
in some part, is neuer sharpe, but of a long contiunance. 
A Palsey is occasioned by a weake Apoplexy and is to bee 
feared, lest it should returne to that againe. There is better 
hopes for the cure of it in the spring, and summer seasons, 
then in the Autumnall and winter; if an ague, and a 
shaking come vpon the party affected, it doth presage 
health. 
 
[}Generall directions seruing for the cure 
of the PALSEY.}] 
 
Let the Aire bee hote and dry, procured by a fire, if 
the season of the yeere require it, or by a perfume of 
Cloues, and Rosemary. His meate must likwise bee such 
as heat, and dry, let him eate rosted Chickens, Capons, 
Hens, small Birds, reere Egges. Hee must abstaine from 
swines flesh, fish and broaths; or at the least let them bee 
amended by art. Let his diet bee slender vntill the 14=th.= 
day. For it is very good for the patient to bee abstemious; 
let his drinke bee small, and hee may drinke 
Water sweetned with Hony, or Cynamon-water, or hyppocras. 
It is very expedient that hee moderatly exercise 
the part affected. Sleepe in the day time must bee auoyded, 
his meate must bee such as is answerable to his belly, 
and he should not any way be troubled in mind. 
 
[/24./] Hydromel, Oxymel, the decoction of the Roots of 
Flowers-de-luce, of Sage, Stæchas, Nutmegs, Cinamon. 
Syr: Stæchados, Hysop, Acetosus Simplex, Byzantinus,

of the decoction of Sage, Betony, Hysope, Nutmegges, 
Cloues, Cynamon, Stæchas Flowers, and Rosemary Flowers, 
with the roots of Acorus; to which adde some of the 
former sirrupe. For the space of 5 or 6 dayes the humors 
[^p.17^] 
must bee extenuated, and preparation made for expulsion 
first of all by gentle medicines; then wee will 
euacuate and vse stronger; but such as are compounded 
with Vineger, are obnoxious; for Vineger is an enemy 
to the sinews: wherefore it wee doe vse Vineger, wee will 
mingle it with such simples as doe strengthen the sinews. 
 
The Cephalica veine shall bee opened on that side 
[/25./] 
that is sound, if the Palsey bee caused by blood, and the 
body bee full, a small quantity of bloud shall be taken away, 
lest the naturall heat in a cold body, and by a cold disease, 
should be extinguished. A potion of the roots of Acorus, 
Flower-de-luce, Sage, Rosemary, Betony, Flowers of 
Stæchas, Senæ, Agaricke, Turbith, Ginger, Nutmeg, Cynamon,

Piera Galeni, Hiera Logodali, Diacatholicum, Agaricke 
made into Trochiskes: Vomits and clysters once in 
euery weeke are permitted. In this disease we will rather 
vse pills then Electuaries; because they draw the corrupt 
matter from the parts of farthest distance, wee must 
beginne the cure with gentle purging medicines, especially 
in a dull palsey, and the foureteenth day after, wee will 
vse stronger, fearing that the gentler medicines should not 
preuaile. 
 
Clysters of Sage, Betony, Stæchas, Origan, Mallowes,

Cammomile, Maioram, Centory the lesse, Hollihock, Rew, 
Mercury, the Electuary of Elescopi, Hiera-piera, Benedicta 
Laxatiua, Diacatholicon, oyle of Cammomile, Lillies, by little 
and little we will vse stronger. Let cupping-glasses without 
scarification be fastned to the roote of the sinews, and 
so leisurely bee remoued to the part affected, that the naturall 
spirit and heate may bee drawne to it, and the drowsie 
faculty bee awaked; but lest the strength bee dissolued, let 
the cupping-glasses remaine thereon but a short time. 
 
[^p.18^] [^Original misnumbered as p.26.^] 
An Apophlegmatisme of Nutmeg; Gargarismes; Errhnes; 
Sneezes; dry frictions; eyther with the hands or a 
warme cloth, are excellent; let a plaister of mustard-seede 
bee layed to the nape of the necke; wee will not vse these 
drawing medicines before the patient bee 3. or 4. times 
purged. Such as doe strengthen the braine, and that doe 
digest the reliques, and amend the distemper, must now 
bee vsed. It is apparent, that Triacle and Mithridate doe 
much good in his case, Aurca Alexandrina, and Triacle 
water, Diarrhodon Abbatis, Pliris arconticum, Diamuscum 
dulce, Diambra, new Conserue of Roses, Confectio 
Anacardina, Preserued Acorus, Preserued Ginger, and 
Bastard Pellitory preserued. Diacastoreum, Aqua minsalis 
of our description, is herein of great force. Conserue of 
Sage, Betony, Rosemary-flowers, Flowers of Stæchas, Elecampana, 
Galingal. Let pils be made of the oyle of Beauer-stone 
Assa Fætida, Nutmeg, and the ayre of a Douehouse 
is good by a secret property; let him hold a Nutmeg in 
his mouth and chew it, a Hares braine rosted is good; the 
decoction of the wood Guiacum, Sarsaparilla, Cyna 
with Honey, if the disease bee stubborne: A decoction 
with the roots of Acorus, Flower-de-luce, Worme-seede, 
Ginger, Stæchas, Sage, dried Hysop, Maioram, Rosemary, 
Ground pine, Nutmeg, Cloues, Rootes of Cyna, Guaiacum 
wood, Honey: make a Fomentation for the part affected, 
with the decoction of Milke-thistle; let the whole 
decoction bee applyed to it: make also a bath for the part 
affected of the decoction of a Fox, and couer the place 
affected with the warme skinne. But first of all anoynt the 
place with the Oyle of a Foxe, and let that bee done after 
the bath hath beene vsed, or in the stead of this 
bath, let him vse a bath of Brimstone or Nitre, and that 
which doth settle in the bottome, shall bee taken out, and 
applied to the part first affected: make likewise a hote-house 
with a meete vessell therein, wherein let the patient 
enter morning and euening: it is not amisse, if stones were 
[^p.19^] [^Original misnumberd as p.27.^] 
heat red hot, and a little hot Wine sprinckled vpon them, 
which must then bee so neere layd to the patient, that the 
smoake may ascend to his nostrils. As soone as the patient 
is come out of the stew, or hot-house, he must goe to bed, 
& therein sweat; which that he may the better doe, let him 
drink of old triacle, +Q i. and anoynt the roots of his sinews 
with some oyntment. Likewise a dry bath may bee made 
with a conuenient decoction, which must bee put into a 
vessell, and vnder this make a fire, and a pipe must be soe 
fastened to this vessell, that the vapour may be conueyed 
to the patient. An oyntment of Agrippa, Martiatum, 
Bdellium. An oyntment of the oyle of Foxes, of the oyle 
of Beuer stones, Nutmeg, oyle of Spiknard, oyle of Pepper, 
Camomile, Lillies, powder of Wormes, Galingale, Pepper, 
Hony, oyle of Rew, of Philosophers, of St-Iohns 
wort, of Bays, of Turpentine, Costini, Aquæ Vitæ, oyls 
of brimstone. Too much vse of hot medicines doth bring a 
resolution: wherefore Oyles that too much heate and dry, 
may not safely be permitted: such medicines as are resoluing 
may not bee vsed, vntill the patient bee purged at the least 
4. times, amongst which medicines frictions may bee 
very well reckoned. Also an especiall care ought to bee had 
in applying outward remedies, and seeking out the part 
primarily affected, whereunto wee must minister helpe, 
and not vnto those that are secundarily affected.

[}An appendix or addition seruing for the cure 
of the PALSEY.}] 
 
FIrst, the belly must be purged by a clyster: and after 5. 
or 6. dayes, hee may take such things, as will prepare 
the matter; and then againe, gentler purges must bee prescribed, 
before the humours bee carried another way; for 
some few dayes he must abstaine from preparing and purging 
medicines, and in the interim, let the humours that 
runne to the part affected, be dissolued by Clysters, Gargarismes, 
Sneesings, and medicines that prouoke vomiting. 
Then againe there may be vsed such medicines as will make 
the humours more plyable, and expell them being well 
concocted, by which meanes stronger medicines may 
with more safety be vsed; after that, shall the palsied part be 
strengthned, and the reliques consum'd: and then againe, 
let him for a while forbeare taking medicines, onely once 
euery weeke, or at the most, twice, let him haue a clyster, 
and then wee may vse such as doe prepare, and purge the 
body; and in the meane space, cupping-glasses must be fastned 
to the roote of the marrow of the backebone; for by 
these meanes we shall bring backe the sense to the affected 
part. For the cure of the particular palsied part, an especiall 
[^p.24^] 
care must bee had, that the locall medicines bee applied to 
that part, from whence the palsied sinew doth arise, not 
vpon the whole backe-bone, or braine. Likewise care 
ought to bee had, that those things that will draw spirits, 
and blood to the part affected, may bee applied. Playsters 
of Pitch, Salt, and Mustardseede are excellent for 
this purpose, and after the aforesayd manner wee will cure 
the dulnesse, if it so oppresse any part of the body, that it 
may seeme to bee as it were a broken, or diminished 
palsey: if the palsey bee caused by a cold and ill constitution, 
wee will not vse purging medicines, but onely such 
as are hot, and haue an alteratiue power. 
 
[}A method seruing for the knowledge of MELANCHOLY, 
or BLACKE 
CHOLER.}] 
 
MElancholy is a kinde of doting without a feauer, arising 
from a melancholy humour, which so disturbes 
the seate of the minde, that they speake, and doe things 
repugnant to reason, and that with feare and sadnesse; this 
name is giuen to this disease from the matter, and cause 
thereof. 
 
There be three kinds of Melancholies. The first commeth 
[/51./] 
of grosse Melancholy blood, being full of dregs, gathered 
together in the braine: for Melancholy iuice is more 
[/52./] 
boyld then it should, all the other blood in the body remaining 
pure. 
 
The second happens, when as all the veines of the body 
[/53./] 
are bedewed with melancholy blood, caused for the 
most part by the corruption of the liuer, which doth ingender 
grosse and fæculent blood; or else by the spleene, 
when as eyther by weaknesse, or obstruction it cannot 
clense the liuer from such dregs. 
 
The third kinde is called hypocondriacall melancholly; 
[/54./] 
of which in the next chapter wee will say somewhat more 
largely. 
 
[^p.25^] 
[}The part affected.}] 
 
The part affected is the braine, which is hereby knowne: 
because some principall facultie of the braine is hurt; for 
from the braine, all the soules principall faculties do spring: 
and it so chances, that the braine in this disease is tainted, 
because it is a similar part; for the whole temper of the 
braine is changed into cold and dry by the melancholy humour; 
and herein it appeares, because it neyther suddenly 
comes, neyther is the party suddenly ridde of 
it. The whole essence of the braine is sometime hurt, 
and then it cannot appeare that the sides vnder the short 
ribs, or the stomacke, or any other part is annoyed. But 
sometimes the symptomes of melancholicke men are more 
apparent, because they be more increased, and then a leaden 
hiew doth appeare in the face: sometime it is hurt by consent 
of the stomacke and Mirach. Sometime through the 
corruption of the whole body; and then the face is of a 
blackish colour. Lastly, there is a suppression of monthly 
tearmes, or of pyles, or of some vsuall excrement, viz. the 
superfluities of the liuer, and spleene. The habit of the body 
is leane, hairy, and inclining to blacknesse, and the veines 
are larger then they should be. By this that is sayd, wee may 
vnderstand this effect to bee nothing else, then a deprauing 
of the function of the principall faculty; and therefore wee 
may rather call it a symptome, then a disease. The imaginary 
faculty is offended, but the memory and thoughts are free. 
In conclusion, wee will say that melancholy is a symptome 
seeking the ruine of the principall faculties action, viz. imaginatiue. 
 
[}The Signes.}] 
 
The signes of melancholy are feare and sadnesse, euill 
thoughts without any manifest cause, for vapours arising 
from blacke choler, doe darken the minde; and the 
braine is as it were clowded all ouer, inioying small 
light of reason, which may appeare by their actions. 
[^p.26^] 
They are toucht with a wearinesse of life, and with ill and 
deepe thoughts of minde. At length they talke very idlely. 
Oftentimes you shall finde them crying; and now they delight 
in solitarynes, within short time, they will as much 
condemne it; they are euer musing, and thinking that they 
are beguiled, or that some plots are working against them; 
their sleepe is short, and oftentimes they are therein disquieted 
with troublesome dreames: besides these affects, 
which are alwaies common to melancholy men, some are 
euer laughing, others euer weeping; some imagine themselues 
to be prophets, foretelling much of things to come; 
some haue such an imagination, that they are mighty men; 
others suppose themselues to bee transformed into some 
strange shape, whereby they counterfeit the voyces and 
actions of Cuckoes, some of Cocks, or of some other 
beasts; some thinke they are earthen vessels, and by that 
reason go aside, lest they should be hurt or broken by them 
that meete them; some, though they dread death, yet doe 
they wish it, and sometime kill themselues; some thinke 
they be without heads, others without legs; some, armelesse; 
some refuse meat, supposing the terme of their liues to be at 
an end: some do imagine theeues are come, and that officers 
wait for them to carry them to prison, some feare that the 
earth will swallow the~ vp; some are disquieted with other 
imaginations, euen as his former course of life was: some 
are busied with warlike affaires, strifes, studies, prayers, or 
other courses whereunto they were addicted: in a word, 
these dreame waking. 
 
[}The Causes.}] 
 
The cause of this, is the cold and dry distemper of the 
braine, whether it doth happen by nature, or accidentally 
by a melancholy humour, and ill vapors generated in the other 
parts, or of old time left there: from hence it is, that 
blacke and dreggish vapours doe creepe into seate of 
the mind, wherby the braine in darkned. It is also caused by 
[^p.27^] 
too much heate in the head, so that the blood is burnt vp, 
and from thence come melancholy vapours, which sometime 
is obserued in feauers. A continuation of sadnesse, superfluous 
watchings, solitarynes, and the staying of 
monthly tearmes and piles, brings this disease; for maligne 
vapour carried vp by the corrupt blood, doth vitiate the 
minde. Againe, the vse of such things that doe not nourish 
well, especially if they bee not well digested, oftentimes 
cause this disease; to widdows, and such as are deepely in 
loue, this doth commonly happen; because the minde is 
spent with care and griefe; sometime the liuer is in fault, 
when by reason of some great distemper, it doth beget 
store of blacke blood. Sometime it is caused by the spleene, 
when as it doth draw great store of that blood, and doth 
not expell it; for hereby in time the whole body is bedewed 
with melancholy blood. 
 
[}Prognostiques.}] 
 
Melancholy, which doth seaze vpon the essence of the 
braine, and continues long, making the affect as it were naturall, 
is altogether incurable: yet if it were taken at the beginning, 
the cure would be easier. Too much sadnes, and immoderate 
feare is a signe of melancholy: but if they that are 
troubled with this affect, are troubled with the pyles, there 
is hope of cure. And it is to be feared, that it should grow 
to an Apoplexy, or conuulsion, or madnesse, or falling sicknesse, 
and therefore this mischiefe must presently be cured. 
Melancholy is troublesome to men, but especially old men, 
but to women it is dangerous. Melancholy caused by the 
corruption of the whole body, as also that which is caused 
by the default of the braine, is hardly cured. 
 
[}A method for the cure of MELANCHOLY.}] 
 
IT is wrought by these remedies following. Let the aire 
be cleare, of a wholesome smell, moyst, and in the rest 
[^p.28^] 
temperate; his diet must bee such as doe moysten in a 
meane, and such as is of good iuyce, and easie digestion, not 
breeding wind: reere eggs, flesh of Hens, Capons, Chickens, 
Partriges: Fish of tender substance. Parsely, Raysins, Endiue, 
Borage, Buglosse, Lettuce, Mallowes, Spinage, may be vsed 
in broths: let him drinke white Wine, and exercise himselfe 
moderately, and walke in pleasant places; hee may sleepe 
somewhat longer then ordinary; if nature cannot expell the 
excrements, art must bee vsed: perturbations of the minde 
must chiefely be auoyded, especially feare and sadnesse, and 
in stead thereof the minde must bee cherished with mirth, 
stedfastnesse and good hopes. 
 
[}Preparers.}] 
 
The sirrupe of the iuyce of Borage, Buglosse, or Violets, 
of Epithymon, of Apples, Quinces, Fumitory, Hops, Oxymel

doe moysten, and moderately heate, especially are to bee

veine bee opened; if the whole body abound with melancholy 
blood, if the median appeare not, wee may open a 
veine in the anckle, especially in women,whose monthly 
[^p.29^] 
termes are suppressed, or in men, who formerly had the 
piles; but if the braine be in fault, it is not so requisite, vnlesse 
it cannot bee cured by other meanes, and then the Cephalica 
veine shall be cut; if this will not preuaile, we must 
cut a veine in the forehead. Wee must begin with milder 
medicines, and seldome vse purgers, because they will dry 
more then is required; and also the matter must bee emptied 
by distances of time, that nature may bee releeued. Alwayes 
moystners shall bee mingled with laxatiue medicines, 
and such as may comfort the spirits, and principall 
parts.

without scarification, may bee layd to his rib gristles. 
Horse-leeches may bee set to his forehead, and other 
parts. Let Cauteries be made in the coronall seame, and the 
thicknesse of the skull may bee diminished by a Trepan,
