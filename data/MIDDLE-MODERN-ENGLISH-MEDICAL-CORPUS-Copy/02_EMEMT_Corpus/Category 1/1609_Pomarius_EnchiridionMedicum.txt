[^p.1^] 
[}AN EPITOME 
of the whole course 
of Physicke.}] 
 
[}PARS I.}] 
 
[}Doctor.}] SEeing you are 
desirous to bee 
admitted to the 
practise of physicke; 
let mee 
heare how you 
know your selfe fitte and able to practice 
in so noble an Arte; for euerie 
man is not fitte to be a Physition according 
to the prouerbe, Ex quolibet ligno 
non sit Mercurius: therefore tell me first, 
what manner of man a Physition must 
be. 
 
[}Student.}] A Physition must be learned, 
[/1./] 
iudiciall, sober, of honest conuersation, 
[^p.2^] 
not full of wordes, but secret, 
chaste, truely Religious, not couetous, 
or giuen to wine; and finally, hee must 
be a Philosopher, according to the saying, 
vbi desinit Philosopus, incipit Medicus. 
 
[}Doct.}] It is most true, and that is it 
which Hippocrates crieth out on, when 
hee did perceiue how hard a matter it 
was to bee a perfect Physition: vitæ 
breuis, ars longa, occasio præceps, experimentum 
periculosum, iudicium difficile. As 
if he should haue said, the whole life of 
man will not suffice to attaine vnto a 
full knowledge of the Arte of Physick; 
for it spreadeth it selfe so large, that if 
it bee compared with the course of 
mans life, the life is so short, that it is 
not sufficient to attaine to a full knowledge 
of the whole Arte. And Galen 
himselfe affirmeth, in Libro De pulsibus, 
that hee had spent many yeares in the 
practise thereof, and yet could not attaine 
to a perfect knowledge of the 
same. If then this happened vnto the 
Prince of Physitions (Hippocrates excepted) 
what may we thinke our selues able 
to attaine vnto? If, I say, hee spent so 
much time and labour in one part of 
[^p.3^] 
physicke, how much time and labour 
may bee required to attaine to a fulll 
knowledge of the whole art? And therfore 
it is a great error in such men, that 
doe dreame that the art of physicke may 
be easily attined vnto: so that if they 
haue gotten two or three Chimical medicines, 
without any other grounds; they 
professe themselues to be great Doctors 
and cunning Physitions. But to let that 
passe; let me heare your definition of 
physicke: tell me, what is physicke? 
 
[}Stud.}] Physicke is an arte that doth 
preserue the body of man in health; and 
being sicke, cureth the diseases of the 
same. 
 
Or physicke, according to Hippocrates, 
is adiection, and subtraction: or 
according to Galen in his Arte parua; It 
is the knowledge of things healthfull, of 
things vnhealthfull, and of neither. 
 
[}Doct.}] Shew me how that may be. 
 
[}Stud.}] It may bee three waies, as the 
body, the cause, and the signe: as that is 
a healthful body which enioyeth health; 
a healthful cause which worketh or conserueth 
health: that is an healthful signe 
which doth demonstrate health to bee 
[^p.4^] 
present: and that is said to bee an vnhealthfull 
body which is sickely: and 
vnhealthfull cause, which worketh the 
disease: an vnhealthful signe, which sheweth 
the kind and greatnesse of the disease, 
or doeth premonstrate the euent 
thereof. We call that a neuter, that neither 
enioyeth health nor sickenes, which 
is not perfectly sound nor yet sicke. 
 
Or physick is the study of things natural, 
of things not natural, and of things 
against nature. 
 
[}Doct.}] Into how many parts is physick 
diuided? 
 
[}Stud.}] There rein generall fiue parts 
of physicke: the 1. is Physiologia, and searcheth 
out the whole nature and constitution 
of man: th_[^ORIG. BLANK^] 2. is Hugiene, and doth 
study in the pres_[^ORIG. BLANK^]ruation of the health of 
man: the 3. is P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]hologia, and is exerc_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ed 
in searching ou_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]he sick_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] & the ca_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]se: 
the 4. is Se_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] and is ex_[^ORIG. BLURRED]rcised in _[^ORIG. BLANK^]hewing 
the signe either o_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ife or d_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]th: 
the 5. is Therapeutica, and that teacheth 
the order of curing affects besides nature: 
and vnder this last part is comprehended 
three oth_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] parts, Dieta, compositio 
medicamentorum, and Chirurgia. 
 
[^p.5^] 
[}Doct.}] I see you are reasonably wel acquainted 
with the definition, and diuision 
of the art. But you told me but now 
that physick was the study of things natural, 
of things not natural, and of things 
against nature: tell mee, what are those 
things that you terme naturall? 
 
[}Stud.}] Those things that are termed 
[/2./] 
naturall are seuen: Elements, temperaments, 
humours, spirits, parts, faculties, 
and functions: in the knowledge of 
which Physiologia, or the knowledge of 
naturall things is exercised. 
 
[}Doct.}] Tel me then, what is an Element? 
 
[}Stud.}] Element is a body most pure, and 
simple, & the least part of the same wherin 
[/3./] 
it is: which c_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] not be diuided into any 
other kind, and of it all things natural 
haue their originall beginning. This definition 
is t_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ken out of Galen and Aristotle, 
and therefore cannot be denied. 
 
[}Doct.}] How many Elements are there? 
 
[}Stud.}] There are are foure Elements: 
viz. the fire, which is extreame hotte and 
moderately drie: the aire extreame moist 
and moderately hot: the water extream 
cold and moderately moist: the earth 
extream drie & moderately cold. In heat 
[^p.6^] 
the fire with the aire, and in drines with 
the earth, in moisture the aire, with the 
water, and in heat with the fire; in coldnesse 
the water with the earth, and in 
moisture with the aire; the earth in drines 
with the fire, and in coldnesse with 
the water, doe all consent and agree. 
And as the water to the fire is extreame 
contrary, so is the aire to the earth: of 
the mixture of these Elements all naturall 
bodies haue their composition. And 
yet it is nothing necessary that they be 
equally mingled in the body, but according 
to that that hath dominion, the body 
is named cholerick, sanguin, phlegmatick, 
or melancholick; and haue their 
denomination of the foure naturall humors: 
viz. choler, blood, flegme, and 
melancholy, which take their qualities 
of the Elements: for choler is hot & drie 
according to the nature of the fire, and 
blood is hot and moist according to the 
nature of the aire, flegme is cold & moist 
according to the water, & melancholy 
in no point doth disagree from the earth. 
 
[}Doct.}] You haue well declared how 
naturall bodies are framed by the mixture 
of the Elements: let me heare how 
[^p.7^] 
briefly you can shew me the differences 
of temperatures. 
 
[}Stud.}] Tempteratures are in number 
[/4./] 
nine, whereof there are eight do exceed; 
and therefore they may be better called 
distemperatures, then temperatures: the 
ninth is temperate, for it doeth exceed in 
no quality. Of distemperatures there be 
foure simple, and foure compound: the 
simple are heat, cold, drines, & moisture, 
of the which ioyned together distemperatures 
are made. The ninth is neither 
hot, cold, dry, nor moist, & it is framed of 
them all: and that is it which the Grecians 
do call [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is, Bene temperatu~, 
[/5./] 
or according to the Arithmeticians, 
Te~peramentu~ ad pondus, a co~plexion measured 
by weight; because there are as many 
degrees of heat as there are of cold, of 
drines as there are of moisture: the other 
which be distemperatures, be not measured 
by weight, but by dignity; as in the 
heart wel tempered, heat doth exceed; in 
the braine well tempered, moisture doth 
[/6./] 
exceed; in the fatte wel tempered, cold; in 
the bones wel tempered, drines; and this 
is called temperamentum secundu~m iustitiam 
distributiuam, a temperature rightly 
[^p.8^] 
measured or disposed with equality. 
 
[}Doct.}] But is it possible to find a body so 
complexioned that we may say, here is a 
body framed of the foure Elements, ad 
po~du_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], that is, to a iust & equal proportio~? 
 
[}Stud.}] I am persuaded that it is altogether 
impossible for any man to find such 
a body, that the foure Elements may be 
said to be equally proportioned in him: 
for either heat or moisture hath still the 
predomination, or coldnes and drines. 
And yet I thinke it not be impossible, 
but that there may be such a body, but 
hard to be found, as hard to come by as 
Quintilians Orator, or the wise man 
which the Stoicks defined: a man harder 
to come by then the rich Iewell, the 
Philosophers stone; which although diuers 
brag that it may be framed, yet it can 
neuer be attained vnto: so we may imagine 
such a man to bee, as by the consent 
of nature was neuer framed, nor is euer 
like to be. But if there be any that can 
[/7./] 
find a man that is neither too grosse nor 
too slender, nor very ful of haire, nor yet 
smooth & without haire, nor soft, nor yet 
hard, blacke nor white, hot nor cold, drie 
nor moist: and to be brief, such a one that 
[^p.9^] 
keepeth a meane without al excesse, if, I 
say, we can find such a one, then are we 
sure we haue a body complexioned ad 
pondus, and to iust proportion. 
 
[}Doct.}] Then you conclude there can 
be found no body so framed, that it may 
be termed Corpus temperatum ad pondus. 
 
[/8./] 
[}Stud.}] It is very true. 
 
[}Doct.}] Then shew me the iudgement 
and signes of Temperaments. 
 
[}Stud.}] That was I minded to pe_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]forme 
if you had not spoken thereof: for it is 
to no end to know the differences of 
temperatures if we know not the signes 
of the same also. First then we know by 
the touching, heate from cold, moysture 
from drithe: and these that are of a 
soft disposition of body, the flesh being 
laxe and thinne, them wee iudge to bee 
moyst: those that haue a thicke and a 
hard skinne, them wee iudge to be drie. 
Then wee proceed as well to physicall 
actions, as to morall, neither doe wee 
account physicall onely naturall, but 
vitall, and the animal also. Morall 
actions are affects of a body concupiscible, 
angry, and rationall: for 
Galen in one booke doth teach that 
[^p.10^] 
Animimores sequuntur temperamentu~ corporis: 
that the disposition of the mind 
doth follow the temperature of the bodie. 
In men that by nature are hot, 
the heart, and the Artiers beate veheme~tly: 
but in men of a cold disposition, 
the heart and pulse beate remisly and 
slowly: men of an hot dispositio~ are very 
much inclined to lust and venerie; the 
cold disposition is for the most part very 
slow or vnable: notwithstanding it 
sometimes doth happen, that the hot 
complexion proueth vnfit for Venus, because 
the members of generation are ouer 
cold. 
 
The hot complexion is prone vnto 
anger, they are of a proud and hautie 
stomack, but the cold are feareful, sober, 
and of an abiect mind: the hot complexion 
is crafty, subtill, and ingenious, 
but the cold is dull, slowe and obtuse in 
vnderstanding: the hot complexion 
hath swift motions of the mind, but the 
cold is of a slow and dull spiri_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]: In like 
manner in hot complexions, the teeth 
doe soner grow and increase, then in 
the cold. 
 
We must also consider the forme and 
[^p.11^] 
shape of the body, whether it bee fat or 
leane, because that leauenes doth argue 
an hot body, and the fatnes a cold bodie: 
which is to bee vnderstood by nature, 
not by disease, or by custome, as in 
extraordinarie cares, immoderate vse of 
Uenus, too vehement and often exercise, 
and long fasting, all these cause a leane 
and a thin body: so in like manner idlenes, 
much banquetting, and delicious liuing, 
doth sometimes cause, that a body 
naturally giuen to bee leane, may grow 
fat: And so also a cold disposition may 
grow leane, by greefe, by cares, by 
hunger, & such like, for the body may 
be so macerated, that it may waxe leane 
contrary to nature. 
 
Besides, the cold complexion is not 
so hairy as the hot, as may be perceiued 
by Eunuchs and women which are of a 
glaber and smooth skinne. The signe 
that is taken from the colour of the 
haire is deceitful, because that the colour 
of the haire is cha~ged with the age by the 
dominio~ of a red, yellow, black, or white 
[/9./] 
humor: for in the first age the haires that 
are yellow, heate increasing through 
age, they waxe black at the length, the 
[^p.12^] 
same heate vanishing, and much flegme 
increasing, they waxe white. In like 
manner, by things receiued into the body, 
the constitution is discerned: for 
the hot complexion is offended with 
hot things, as wine not delayed, vehement 
exercise, meates with hot spices, 
and they fall quickly into hot diseases, 
as into Feuers, and other cholerick 
diseases; but those hot things are 
beneficiall vnto cold complexions. 
Moreouer the temperatures of the 
principall parts, as of the heart, the liuer, 
the braine, and the testicles, and 
of those necessarie parts of life, as the 
stomach, and the lungs are knowne by 
their proper signes, as Galen teacheth in 
his Arte parua, of which, for the most 
part Oribasius and Paulus, haue written 
and set forth in their Synopses. 
 
[/10./] 
[}Doct.}] Well, I would haue you as 
briefly discourse of humors, to the intent 
wee may not stand ouer long about 
this first part, which is called Physiologia. 
 
[}Stud.}] I haue already sayd that there 
are foure principall humors, bloud, 
choler, flegme, and melancholy, & these 
are called Primogeniti filij quatuor eleme~torum: 
[^p.13^] 
for choler is of the nature of the fire, 
[/11./] 
flegme of the water, the melancholick 
humor of the earth, bloud of the aire, for 
bloud is hot and moist, as is the aire. 
 
[}Doct.}] Wee will not stand long to discourse 
of humors, because I am perswaded 
that you are sufficie~tly studied therein: 
but tell me your opinion, is bloud the 
onely nourishment of the body or no? 
 
[}Stud.}] It is the opinion of Aristotle, that 
[/12./] 
bloud is the only nourishment of the body, 
& preseruer therof. Although some 
are of opinion, that because some parts 
are spermatick, and other fleshie, that 
therefore the fleshie parts are nourished 
with the bloud, & the spermatick parts 
with the seed, and the bones with the 
marrow, & the stomach with that which 
is called Chilus, that therfore blood is not 
the only nourisher. To which I answere, 
that al those parts are nourished with the 
bloud, some immediatly, as the fleshie 
parts, some mediatly, as the solid parts: 
for the seminal liquor is nothing but 
bloud, made white by the coctio~ alteratiue 
of the solid parts. The marrow 
also is framed of the bloud, and 
therefore according to the Logicians, 
Causa causæ sit causa causa causati: for 
[^p.14^] 
[/13./] 
the bloud is the materiall cause both of 
the marrow and the seed, and therefore 
it is not to bee doubted but that all the 
parts are nourished with the bloud; but 
the stomach to be nourished with the Chilus, 
is affirmed by Galen tertio~ de naturalibus 
facultatibus: But there it is abused by the 
name of Nutrition: for it satisfieth the animall 
appetite by his quality, that is to 
say by his sweetnes: but not the natural 
quality by his substance. And it may 
very well be perceiued by the infant in 
the mothers wombe, whose stomack is 
nourished and doth grow, not by Chilus, 
because hee receiueth no such nourishment 
by the mouth, but materno sanguine, 
which the liuer draweth by the 
veines of the nauell: and therefore the 
stomach is nourished with that bloud, 
which it doth containe in his veines, and 
not by Chilus. 
 
[}Doct.}] I am also of your opinion, but 
I pray you go forwards, and declare vnto 
mee the differences of humours. 
 
[}Stud.}] I will in no wise omit the differences 
of humours, which be in number 
eight, foure naturall, and foure vnnaturall: 
I haue alreadie shewed that the naturall 
[^p.15^] 
is bloud, flegme, choler, and melancholy, 
the vnnatural is the same, turned 
by putrefaction, or else some otherwise 
from their natural qualities; but 
as for the generation of them, it is by the 
vertue of the liuer, working vpon the 
matter and substance of the food receiued 
into the stomack for the nourishment of 
[/14./] 
the body: And euen as there is perceiued 
in new wine, foure differences of 
humours, viz. the flower or boyling of 
the wine, seco~dly the watry substance of 
the wine, thirdly the feces or dregges 
thereof, and lastly the pure and sincere 
wine: so of Chilus in the liuer part is 
made bloud, part watrish flegme, part 
yellow choler, and part grosse or blacke 
choler. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is bloud? 
 
[}Stud.}] Bloud is a temperate humor, 
hot, and moist, sweet, the apt and conuenient 
nourishment of the body. 
 
[}Doct.}] What if flegme? 
 
[}Stud.}] Flegme is a cold humour, moist 
[/15./] 
and without sauour, as it were bloud 
crude, somwhat white, which is carried 
about with the bloud, to the end to mitigate 
the heate of the same, and that it 
[^p.16^] 
may bee conuerted into bloud, by the 
last digesture it helpeth the distribution 
of the humors, and doth nourish those 
parts that are agreeable or like vnto it 
selfe. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is choler? 
 
[}Stud.}] Choler is an humour hot, dry, 
and bitter, which as it were the froth of 
the bloud, is carried together with the 
same, that it may nourish the like members 
vnto the same: it openeth the Meatus, 
and penetrateth: it is profitable to 
the nourishment of those parts, that haue 
the like temperament. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is melancholy, or black 
choler? 
 
[}Stud.}] Melancholy or blacke choler is 
[/16./] 
a naturall humor, cold, and dry, thick, 
grosse, blacke, and sharpe part of which 
is carried with the bloud, to the end to 
make the same the thicker, and to nourish 
the bones and the spleene, and it is 
as it were the dregs and sediment of the 
bloud. All these foure humours, as I 
haue said, being made vnnaturall, they 
turne to the hurt of the body, as when 
melancholy is burned, it beco~meth vitious, 
and causeth madnes: when it is 
[^p.17^] 
mingled with too much flegme, it causeth 
a doltish disposition, and worketh cold 
diseases. When blood becommeth vnnaturall, 
it is made wheyish and watrish, 
and is very hurtfull, as in the hydropsie: 
when red choler is burned, it becommeth 
vitious and biting: when flegme 
is made vnnaturall through a weake digesture, 
it is made a watrish humor, and 
so hurtfull to the body. 
 
There is also another natural humor, 
and is Primogenius, the first and chiefe 
humor, called Humidum radicale, which is 
[/17./] 
ingendred in the similer parts or insited 
in nature: for from the first beginning 
the members of the whole body are filled 
with a certaine dewie humor, or oily 
moistnesse: truely the first thing that is 
ingendred, hauing its beginning from 
the blood menstruall. This humor yeeldeth 
nourishment to the naturall heate; 
and therfore by the same it is consumed, 
and needeth restauration; which is performed 
by the accession of nourishment. 
Galen termeth this humor the solid substance 
of the similer parts. 
 
[}Doct.}] Now it resteth that you shew 
me the seat or place of euery one of these 
[^p.18^] 
humours. 
 
[}Stud.}] These 4. humors which are inge~dred 
in our bodies, being mixed, they 
are contained in vna massa sanguinis: that 
is, in the fountaine of blood which is said 
to be the better part of it selfe; and being 
exactly confused, they rest in the 
veines; which the Physitions doe consider 
as it were the chiefe Elements of the 
bodie: but those humors which are by 
nature deriued without the veines, whether 
it be yellow choler in the gaule, or 
melancholy which the splene draweth, 
or flegme which is ingendred in the stomacke 
through crudities, or the matter 
which distilleth from the braine to the 
nostrils, and such like, they are in no 
wise to be accou~ted elements of our body, 
and therfore they be not humors but 
excrements, and so they are called: 
which nature, whiles it is in strength 
doth expell as vnprofitable vnto places 
conuenient and the excramentall seat of 
yellow choler is the gaule, from whence 
it is purged by vrine and the stoole: the 
receptacle of the melancholick humor is 
the splene, by which being drawne, it is 
partly co~ncertd into the nature therof, & 
[^p.19^] 
partly it is deiected to the stomacke. 
 
[}Doct.}] Proceed now to spirits, and let 
[/18./] 
me know what a spirit is. 
 
[}Stud.}] A spirit is a subtile flame, or rather 
an airy substance, giuing strength 
and power to exercise proper actions 
in euery member. 
 
Spirits be two fold, the one vitall, the 
other animall; the vitall spirit is a subtill 
flame engendred from the blood, and is 
dispersed by vertue of the heart into all 
the body, to giue vnto the same lively 
heat, and a power of motion and action. 
The efficient cause is a naturall power in 
the heart; the matter from whence it 
proceedeth is blood, for it is ingendred 
of the blood, which is in the left ventricle 
of the heart: the forme is the flame it 
selfe, flying through all the Artiers. 
 
The finall causes are two: the first is 
that it might giue liuely heate vnto the 
body: the second is, that it may be the 
instrument of action and motion in the 
whole body. 
 
The animal spirit is as it were a _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]arrebeame 
which is sent from the braine by 
the Nerues into all the body, to giue motion, 
and sense, and all other animal actions 
vnto the same. 
 
[^p.20^] 
[}Doct.}] From whence is the Animall 
spirit ingendred? 
 
[}Stud.}] It is ingendred of the vitall spirits, 
by the vertue of the braine elaborating 
and concocting the same. There 
are some that adioyne a third kind of 
spirit: that is Spiritus naturalis, ingendred 
in the liuer; which is the thin substance 
of the blood, and is like vnto a vapour: 
this spirit is carried by the hollow veine, 
together with the blood into the heart; 
where it is wrought by the naturall 
strength of the heart, and so is made a vitall 
spirit; and so the naturall spirit is as 
it were the matter of the vitall spirit, and 
the vitall spirit is the matter of the animall 
spirit. 
 
[}De partibus}] 
 
[/19./] 
[}Doct.}] Goe forward vnto the parts of 
mans body, and tell me first what a part 
is. 
 
[}Stud.}] Euery member of the bodie is 
[/20./] 
accounted for a part of the body: and 
they are of two sorts; some principall, 
and some officiall: the braine, the heart, 
and the liuer are accounted principall 
members; some also account the testicles 
amongst the principall members. 
 
[^p.21^] 
The officiall members are the sinews, 
[/21./] 
and they doe serue to the braine: the arteries 
which doe serue to the heart; the 
veines which doe serue to the liuer; the 
spermaticke vessels, which be inserueint 
to the stones. There bee also some 
parts that be called partes similares, or 
Homogenæ; and some Dissimilares, or Heterogene. 
The Similar parts are so called, 
for being diuided, they remaine in themselues 
such as they were before; and those 
are the bones, cartilagies, ligaments, tendons, 
fibres, membrans, the skinne, and the flesh, 
with the fatte, and such like. The members 
or parts Dissimilar, are the contrary. 
Some members are called instrumentall, 
as the stomacke, the reines, the bowels, 
with all the great sinews. 
 
[}Doct.}] It followeth that we speake of 
[/22/] 
faculties, or powers. Tell me therefore 
how many sorts of faculties or powers 
are there? 
 
[}Stud.}] There are three sorts of powers, 
that is to say, Animal, Spiritual, and Naturall: 
the Animall facultie (according 
to Plato, whom the Physitions do follow) 
is placed in the braine: the vitall or spirituall 
is placed in the heart; the natural 
[^p.22^] 
in the liuer. Aristotle in secundo De Anima, 
rehearseth fiue faculties or powers of the 
soule: viz. Potentiam vegetatiuam, sentientem, 
Apperitiuam, loco motiuam, and Rationalem. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is that vegetatiue power? 
 
[}Stud.}] The vegetatiue power is that 
which doth nourish, increase, & strengthen 
the body; and therefore it doeth 
containe these foure faculties; that is, facultatem 
nutritiuam, auctricem, generatricem, 
and formatricem. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is that nutrition or nourishment? 
 
[}Stud.}] It is the conuersion of meate 
and drinke into a spirituall substance, 
performed by the force of heate, that 
there may bee a restoring of the same, 
which began to be decayed. 
 
The efficient cause of nourishment is 
naturall heat. Materia ex qua, or the matter 
from whence it springeth, is the meat 
and drinke receiued into the body. 
 
Materia in qua, or the subiect, is mans 
liuing body. The formall cause is the 
same Assimilation or conuersion of meate 
and drinke into the similitude of euerie 
[^p.23^] 
member to be nourished: for one part 
is turned into the substance of the bone, 
another into the substance of the flesh, 
&c. The end, is the restoring of the same 
which began to be consumed: for when 
the naturall heate doeth consume any 
thing, that same must be restored againe 
by nutrition: euen as in a Lamp, the oyle 
being consumed, the same must be again 
[/23./] 
increased. Therefore the finall cause is 
the co~seruation of that thing, which can 
not be diuided: that is, of a man, or of 
any other liuing creature. 
 
[}Doct.}] What are the Organs of Nutrition? 
 
[}Stud.}] It is the mouth which receiueth 
and cheweth the nourishment: the Oesophage, 
that conueieth it: the stomacke 
turning it into Chylus, by the worke of 
the liuer: to which are admixed the rest 
of the humours, the veines carrying and 
conueying the blood to euery member, 
in which there is made Assimilation, and 
application of nourishment. 
 
[}Doct.}] Let me know the faculties and 
powers of euery member. 
 
[}Student}] The common Faculties 
[^p.24^] 
[/24./] 
which resteth in euery member are said 
to be foure: viz. the attractiue, the retentiue, 
the concoctiue, and the expulsiue; 
for euery member hath a faculty to 
draw, to retaine, to alter, and expell. 
 
As for example: the stomacke doth 
first draw the meat: secondly, it retaineth 
it: thirdly, it doeth alter it, that is, it turneth 
it into Chilus: and fourthly, it doeth 
expell it. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is hunger and thirst? 
 
[/25./] 
[}Stud.}] Hunger is a desire of meate, 
when as the veines Mesariaces beeing 
empty of nourishment, doe draw from 
the stomacke by a kind of sucking, and 
haling; the stomacke is as it were Culina 
communis totius corporis, a common Kitchin 
of the whole body. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is thirst? 
 
[}Stud.}] Thirstines is an appetite of humectation, 
[/26./] 
& cooling in drithe or heat: 
the Organ of hunger and thirst is the 
mouth of the stomacke, in which the 
same irritation or prouoking is felt. 
 
[}Doct.}] Now shew me how nourishment 
is made. 
 
[}Stud.}] The stomack doth concoct the 
meat, and turneth it into Chilus; the same 
[^p.25^] 
Chilus, is sent per [^GREEK OMITTED^] into the intestins, 
Duodenum, and Ieiunum; from thence the 
veines Mesaraices plucketh it, and turning 
it into a more pure and liquid 
masse, sendeth it vnto the liuer, but the 
excrements slippe downe to the inferiour 
intestins: the liuer turneth the Chilus 
into the masse of bloud, which consisteth 
of the foure humors, bloud, choler, 
flegme and melancholy. And the 
bloud is sent by the veines, from the 
liuer part vpwards, and part into the 
right ventricles of the heart, to nourish 
the heart and the lungs, and to ingender 
vitall spirits; part discendeth downewards, 
to nourish the inferiour members: 
but the other humours which are 
separated from the bloud, part floweth 
into the gall; as yellow choler; part into 
[/27./] 
the spleene, as black choler: the watry 
or wheyish matter slippeth to the reines 
and bladder, and so becometh vrin, or 
else it doth transpire by sweat. These be 
the excrements of the second decoction 
or digestion, which are made in the 
liuer and the veines. 
 
Last of all, the third Decoction is 
made in those parts, to the which excrements 
[^p.26^] 
do flow: which, as I say, do passe 
by insensible transpiration of the skin, 
and part with the vrin and excrements. 
The bloud doth nourish the members 
by apposition, and assimilation, that is, 
when it sticketh to the members, and is 
adglutinated and waxeth warme, and 
so at the length, after many changes, it 
is made like vnto the part, and is as it 
were turned into the same substance, 
and then it is called second humidity: 
the Arabians doe call it Cambium. 
 
From hence the digestions, or concoctions 
are numbred to bee three, the 
first is performed in the stomack and 
intestins, the second in the liuer and 
veines, the third in all the members and 
solid parts; and the rule is, Vitium prioris 
concoctionis, non potest corrigi per sequentes. 
 
[}Doct.}] I see you doe briefly run ouer 
this first part of physick concerning 
things naturall: let me heare you deliuer 
the rest in as short a manner; and let me 
know how many things there bee that 
are called not naturall? 
 
[^p.27^] 
[}The second part of things 
not natural, called Hugiene, 
and doth respect the conseruation 
of mans health.}] 
 
[}PARS 2.}] 
 
[}Stud.}] THere are six things 
necessarie to the 
nourishment and 
preseruatio~ of mans 
life, and are called, not natural. 
 
1 The Aire. 
2 Meate and Drinke. 
3 Sleepe and watchfulnes. 
4 Exercise and rest. 
5 Emptines and repletion. 
6 The affects of the mind. 
 
[}Doct.}] Why are they called things not 
naturall? 
 
[}Stud.}] Because they are not natural parts 
[^p.28^] 
of a man. they are not within, but without 
the man, they are a necessary matter, 
and helpe for the preseruation & keeping 
of the body of man, they are called 
non naturales, viz. such things as are not 
borne with vs. 
 
[}Doct.}] What doth the Aire concerne 
the health of our bodies? 
 
[}Of the Aire}] 
 
[}Stud.}] THe Aire by it selfe is hot 
and moist, and the Attraction 
thereof is so necessarie to all liuing 
creatures, that to whatsoeuer thing 
the way of respiration is wanting, it 
presently dieth: and experience teacheth 
vs, that the temperature, or distemperature 
therof, doth change the constitution 
of the body; the aire being sweet 
and wholesome, doth refresh and nourish 
the spirits. 
 
A grosse Aire maketh the body fat 
and strong, but the wit dull, and slow, 
such as Cicero writeth the Thebans to 
be: but a pure cleare aire, such as was 
at Athens, maketh men liuely, and sharp 
witted. 
 
[^p.29^] 
That is the best Aire, that is pure, 
cleere and thin, not grosse, troublesome 
or cloudy. 
 
Hip. in lib. de flatibus, affirmeth that the 
aire is not onely the author of life vnto 
mortall men, but also the author of diseases, 
and death. 
 
Galen in Arte medicinale, saith, Ab 
Aire afficitur, mutatur corpus, quia aut c_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]fit, 
aut frigesit, aut exucatur, aut humectatur. 
 
[}Doct.}] What say you to meate and 
drinke? 
 
[}Of meate and drinke}] 
 
[}Stud.}] Ovr bodies are nourished 
and refreshed with meate 
and drinke, euen as the lampe with oyle, 
or waxe: but in the vse thereof there are 
two things to be obserued, the first, that 
meat and drinke be receiued at accustomed 
and conuenient times: for where it 
is too long deferred, the stomack being 
emptie, is filled with euill humours: for 
the stomack doth not suspend, or intermit 
his naturall action, wherefore, where 
it wanteth meat, there it falleth backe againe 
vpon excrements. 
 
[^p.30^] 
The second obseruation is, that wee 
take so much meate and drinke as may 
refresh the natural strength of the body, 
and not oppresse it: for as Cicero in Catone 
Maiore saith: Nam cibi & potionis nimia 
copia menti & corpori obest. And how 
can a man haue a good disposition of 
mind, whose body is ouermuch filled 
with meat and drinke? For which cause 
temperance doth very much auaile for 
the garnishing both of the minde and of 
the body; for it is a mother and a sweet 
nurse both of health, wisedome, and many 
other vertues. 
 
Hippocrates saith, that abstinence is 
Mater sanitatis, the mother of health; and 
that labour and exercise doeth cause a 
strong body. 
 
Syracke saith in Cap. 17. that abundance 
of meat begetteth diseases, and 
that gluttony doeth fill the body with 
vitious humours. 
 
Plato in his second Booke De legibus 
doth forbid the vse of wine, and especially 
vnto children, vntill they be eighteene 
yeares of age, and gineth a reason, 
that, Non decetignem, igni adijcere. And 
these verses are worthy the consideration: 
 
[^p.31^] 
Immodici sensus perturbat copia bacchi: 
Inde quis enumeret quot mala proueniant? 
Corporis exhaurit succos, animiq, vigorem 
Opprimit, ingenium strangulat, atque necat. 
 
[}Doct.}] That is very true: for wee see 
what drowsie sots those common tospots, 
& tauerne haunters are, and how 
vnfit to euery good action, subiect to euery 
kind of disease, as Palsies, Apoplexies, 
Hydropsies, Epelipsies, gouts, & 
such like: besides they are turned for the 
most part from men to monsters, and 
their minds are as full of filthie disires, 
as their bodies of foule diseases. But I 
pray you proceed vnto the next, which 
is sleepe and watchfulnes: let mee know 
how you doe define the same. 
 
[}Of Sleepe and Watchfulnes}] 
 
[}Stud.}] SLeepe is a rest and quietnes of 
[/28./] 
the vertue animall, which 
hapneth when the profitable vapours 
of the nourishment doe ascend vp 
[^p.32^] 
into the braine, where they doe sweetly 
moysten, and euery where flowing in 
the braine, doe obstruct the Meatus and 
passages of the senses and moouing 
Nerues, thorow which the vertue of the 
seness doe by little and little faile. 
 
The Efficient cause is heate, which as 
Hip. saith, in sleepe it flieth more inwards, 
to the end to helpe concontion, 
from whence it hapneth that the outward 
members doe easily waxe cold in 
sleepe, and doe require to be more warmer 
couered. 
 
The Material cause is a sweet vapour 
ascending from the nourishment into 
the brain, and stopping the Meatus of the 
senses and spirits, that the members forsake 
their motion. 
 
The Formal cause is the rest of the 
outward senses, that is, hearing, and seeing, 
in like manner local mouing, as neither 
the hands, nor the feet doe moue any more, 
or performe their office. 
 
The Finall causes are first a moystning 
and a recreation of the braine, and 
[/29./] 
of the heart. According to Virgil: Fessos 
sopor irrigat artus. 
 
Secondly, that the action of the stomacke, 
[^p.33^] 
and of the liuer in concoction 
may be the stronger; drawing inwards 
the heat and the spirits: for to that end 
doth the animall faculties rest in sleepe, 
to the end the natural may more stronger 
performe their office. 
 
Thirdly, that it may be the image of 
death, according to Ouid: 
 
Stulte quid est somnus, gelidæ nisi mortis 
imago? 
 
Galen calleth it frater mortis, the brother 
of death: for as in sleepe the body 
taketh its rest, and the soule watcheth; 
so also in death the body resteth, but the 
soule and spirit liueth. 
 
As concerning the order and length 
of sleepe; we must consider how much 
and how long is conuenient to euery 
body: for long sleepe is more conuenient 
for them, that as yet haue not attained 
to a perfect digestion; whether it 
happeneth through the eating of euill 
meats, or through the wrakenes of the 
vertue digestiue. 
 
And forasmuch as sleepe doeth slacken, 
and make laxe the animall powers, 
it is not so necessary for those that be 
fasting, or to such as do suffer much hunger; 
[^p.34^] 
for thereby the head is filled with 
fumes and euaporations eleuated from 
the feces, & superfluities retained in the 
stomack. But on the contrary, too much 
watching is hurthfull to the braine: it 
doth debilitate and weaken the senses: 
it doth burne the humors, and is the cause 
of sharpe diseases: sometimes of frensies, 
of madnesse, melancholy, and deliriums. 
In this therefore we must be carefull to 
consider how much is sufficient: for as 
Hippocrates saith, both sleepe and watchfulnes, 
which soeuer it be, if they be immoderate, 
are hurtfull. For the length of 
[/30./] 
sleepe, the most part of Physitions do agree, 
that to strong bodies seuen houres 
in the night is sufficient (for in the day 
time it is generally disallowed) and to 
those that are weaker eight houres at 
the most. 
 
[/31./] 
Plato in Timæo saith, when the world 
shutteth vp her eie, we also should shut 
vp our eies: the eye of the world is the 
sunne: therefore sleepe is not long to 
be deferred after the setting of the sun, 
neither presently after supper can sleepe 
be wholsome: for, as Galen saith, Lib.4. 
[^p.35^] 
Aphorismorum, Commentatio 67. a cibis ad 
somnum connersis, caput impletur. A certain 
great man was wont to say, that he found 
nothing better for the preseruation of 
his health, then to read nothing after 
supper to write nothing, nor to be long 
out of his bedde: so, said he, I am very 
wel able to arise in the morning, & with 
cheerefulnesse to follow my busines. 
 
He that hath a strong stomacke, let 
him lie first vpon the right side; but he 
that hath a weake digestiue facultie, 
should first lie vpon the left side; and afterwards 
vpon the right; for to lie vpon 
the left side, doth better helpe digestion, 
and vpon the right side it helpeth better 
for the distribution of the meat. 
 
[}Doct.}] The next thing not naturall, is 
[/32./] 
exercise and rest: how may that auaile 
for the benefit and health of the bodie? 
 
[}Of exercise and rest.}] 
 
[}Stud.}] A Great part of the preseruatio~ 
of the health of mans body 
doth consist in due exercise and rest; 
for both these are necessary both to the 
[^p.36^] 
body and the minde; of which Ouid 
saith: 
 
Cernis vt ignauum corrumpant ocia corpus, 
Vt capiunt vitium nimoneantur aqua. 
 
In these verses the similitude is of the 
body and water. For as water that 
doth not mooue doth easily putrifie; so 
the body also groweth to corruption 
without exercise. 
 
In like manner of the mind and vnstanding, 
Ouid V. Trist. Elegia 12. saith: 
 
Adde quod ingenium longa rubigine læsum, 
Torpet, & est multo, quam fuit anie munus. 
 
Where he calleth it Longam rubiginem, 
& otium ignauum, he meaneth that, wherby 
the whole force of the wit aud vnderstanding 
is ouerthrowne; or at the least 
doth languish and is diminished: euen as 
by the contrary it is refreshed and made 
sharpe. 
 
There are three profits and commodities 
that ariseth by motion and exercise: 
the first is, it maketh the bodie 
strong. 
 
Secondly, it doth excite and increase 
naturall heate. 
[^p.37^] 
Thirdly, the spirits and the senses are 
thereby made more stronger and sharper. 
 
As concerning the times of exercise, 
[/33./] 
the Aphorism of Hippocrates doth teach 
vs [^GREEK OMITTED^] labours before 
meate, he calleth motion or exercise of 
the body, labours. Therefore before 
meate, and not after, the body must bee 
exercised; for quietnes after feeding, or 
very little exercise is to be vsed: lest that 
the naturall heat which should be exercised 
about concoction as digesture, 
should be dispersed and so made weaker. 
Of Rest the same Ouid saith: 
 
Quod caret alterna requie, durabile non est, 
Hæc reparat vires, fessaq~, membra leuat. 
 
And in his first booke De Ponto: 
 
Ocia corpus alunt, animus quoq, pascitur illis: 
Immodicus contra carpit virumq~, labor. 
 
Here is to be vnderstood rest, that 
is fitte and conuenient, both to the 
body and minde; whether it be by relaxation 
and recreation, liberal or mean: 
for there is no man of so great strength, 
that he is able to endure continuall stirrings, 
[^p.38^] 
watchings, cares, and labours: but 
at the last both body and minde is dried 
and wearied, vnlesse there be remission 
vsed. Of the manner of vsing exercise 
and rest, Cicero speaketh in the first 
booke of his offices: Ludo, & loco, vti 
quidem licet, sed sicut somno & quietibus cæteris 
tum, cum grauibus serijsq, rebus satisfecerimus. 
 
It is a true saying, that confecto labore, 
dulce est quiescere. And Auicen saith, that 
whosoeuer he be that is of an hotte and 
drie complexion, and by exercise is fallen 
into any notable disease, he is forthwith 
recouered with rest. 
 
[/34./] 
[}Doct.}] The next in order is, Emptines 
and Repletion. 
 
[}Stud.}] It is true, and looke how much 
we may offend to defraud an hungrie 
stomacke; so much shall we offend to 
offer meate vnto a ful stomacke; as Auicen 
[/35./] 
saith in primo Can.fen.3. Cap. De regimine 
cibi & potus. For as the want of meat 
doeth fill the stomacke with euill humors; 
so that same plethoria and continuall 
fulnesse causeth opilations, putrification, 
apostumes, leprosie, and 
[^p.39^] 
feuers. 
 
But this is to be obserued, that if the 
Attractiue faculty, and the Retentiue 
doe remaine in their naturall strenght; 
that then repletion cannot by any 
meanes be hurtfull: especially if a right 
order of meats and drinkes be obserued. 
And so in like manner, is the vertue digestiue 
and expulsiue be strong, emptinesse 
cannot be hurtfull; for thereby the 
body is auoyded of his burdensome and 
hurtfull humours, of which it is requisite 
that it should bee clensed and purged. 
 
But when these faculties are hurt 
and become weake, so that an emptinesse 
cannot bee suffered, and a repletion 
cannot nourish or profit the bodie: 
we must then take heed how we vse the 
one or the other. 
 
[}Doct.}] But how are diseases proceeding 
of fulnes remedied? 
 
[}Stud.}] By vomit, by flux of the belly, 
by flux of blood, at the nose, by vrin, 
by spittle, by sweate, by insensible 
transpirations; which beeing vnfelt by 
vs, doth happen through the strength of 
[^p.40^] 
nature. Moreouer, sometimes there 
must be vsed the incision of a veine, scarification, 
the application of leeches, of 
cupping glasses and vesecatories. 
 
But sometimes it happeneth that none 
of these aforesaid euacuations may bee 
vsed; then must be supplied be exercise, labour, 
frication and rubbings, baths, abstinence, 
sleepe, and such like (especially 
in the times of famine:) but in euery of 
these there must be had a due consideration 
how much and how little is conuenient, 
according to the state of euery bodie. 
 
[/36./] 
[}Doct.}] Now proceed vnto the last of 
things not naturall: which you say is 
Animi Affectus, the perturbations and affections 
of the mind. 
 
[}Of Affections of the mind.}] 
 
[}Stud.}] AFfects are the motions of 
the mind, by which it is 
either exhilarated, or disquieted for sorrow 
and anguish, with such like; are as it 
were Carnifices, & tortores annimi & corporis, 
the very torturers and murderers of 
the mind and bodie: but on the contrarie, 
[^p.41^] 
ioy, hope, and a good conscience, are 
the sweet nurces of life and health, as 
Plato speaketh in 1. De Repub. 
 
Therefore it very much auaileth both 
to the health of the body, & of the mind, 
to be able to moderate these affects in 
that order, that nature may not be hurt: 
for we haue read of some, that with sudden 
ioy haue suddenly died, as Valerius 
reporteth of the two women in Rome. 
 
And what affects arise by anger, may 
easily bee perceiued, when that some 
by extraordinary fury and rage doe fall 
into the Apoplexie, the palsie, spasms, 
and conuulsions, with diseases of the 
ioynts, and sometimes into a trembling 
of the whole body; nether doth there 
happen lesse euill vnto bodies through 
terrour or feare, as the syncop, & fallingsicknes: 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] as on the contrary in some 
kinds of diseases, it is profitable to bee 
terrified and made afraid. 
 
Sadnes and anguish of mind worke 
no small affects, and especially waighty 
cogitations, for it induceth vnquietnes, 
and watchfulnes, which hurteth the senses, 
and diminisheth the strength of the 
whole body: wherefore as Hip. saith, a 
[^p.42^] 
moderation in all those affects is very 
healthfull and profitable. 
 
[}PARS 3.}] 
 
[}Doct.}] YOu told mee in the beginning, 
[/37./] 
that the Art of physicke 
was concluded vnder three things, 
which you termed natural, not natural & 
against nature: of the two first we haue 
briefly spoken; let vs proceed vnto 
the third in like manner: and let mee 
know of you what those things are, 
which are against nature. 
 
[}Stud.}] Those things that are sayd to 
bee against nature, are in number 
three, viz. Sicknes, the Cause of sicknes, 
and Accidents that doe follow 
sicknes. 
 
And generally euery disease is either 
of an euill complexion, an euill composition, 
or a solution of the continuitie, 
which hapneth either in the similer 
members, or in the instrumentall, 
or in both. 
 
And first a disease of an euill complexion 
hapneth sometimes from the 
excesse or defect alone of some qualitie, 
[^p.43^] 
as if either heate or cold doth abound 
in the body, then there is wanting 
the more of moysture and drithe. 
 
Sometimes also a disease hapneth 
from the abundance or defect of some 
humor: as if the bodie doe abound 
with melancholy, or flegme,it hath 
the lesse of choler and bloud, and so on 
the contrary. 
 
Secondly, a disease rising through an 
euill composition, is either from the 
forme and figure of the parts of the 
body, from the quantity, from the number 
and situation of the same parts. 
 
Thirdly, the solution of the continuitie 
hapneth through some Apostume, 
wound, dislocation, rupture, fracture, 
conuulsion, or excoriation. 
 
Furthermore, euery disease is either 
[/38./] 
acute, or chronical. 
 
Al acute diseases are hot, & are iudged 
in 14. dayes, as Hip. doth testifie. 
 
The latter sort of Physitions doe call 
those acute diseases that haue their termination 
in foureteene dayes, and those 
peracute which haue their termination 
in 7. and those perperacute, which haue 
their termination in foure. 
 
[^p.44^] 
Chronicall diseases are cold and dull, 
[/39./] 
and are of longer continuance. In like 
manner acute diseases are termed [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
and sometimes they are changed into a 
Chronicall disease, as the Plurisie, into 
the Gout, the Cholicke into the Palsie. 
 
And Chronicall diseases for the most 
part are determined with a daily consumption. 
 
[}Doct.}] What is Crisis? 
[/40./] 
 
[}Stud.}] Crisis is a swift and vehement 
motio~ of a disease, either to life or death: 
and it happeneth about the supreme intention 
of a disease, that is, the Akmin or 
state. 
 
[/41./] 
And wee must obserue that there are 
foure times of diseases, that is, the beginning, 
the encrease, the Akmin or state, 
and the declination. 
 
The which times are so distributed 
of Hip. that if the increase bee in the 
fourth day, the change hapneth in the 
seuenth; but if the increase be in the fift, 
and seeuenth, the Crisis happeneth in 
the ninth or the eleuenth day: but if the 
disease doe increase in the tenth day, the 
deliuerance hapneth in the foureteenth 
day. 
 
[^p.45^] 
In like manner saith the same Hip. the 
Physition should not be ignorant of the 
day that the Patient fell sicke, nor of the 
houre in the which the body fell into an 
heate, or to waxe cold &c. From whence 
it doth manifestly appeare, that other 
times also are not to bee neglected: for a 
little after, he sayth, For this cause, sayth 
he, shalt thou recken the daies vnto thee, 
in which thou shalt expect eruptions, or 
apostums, in those times prescribed. 
[/42./] 
There is also a quaternall number of 
dayes to bee obserued in all diseases, 
which doth promise an end either to life 
or death, as the same Author witnesseth. 
 
Moreouer, euery disease is either in 
the superiour or inferiour venter, or in 
the veines, whose Crisis hapneth by 
spittle, by vomit, by flux of bloud at the 
nose, by Apostu~s, by seege, by hæmorrhods, 
by menstrous, and by vrin. 
 
And sometimes also a Crisis doth 
happen by sweate: and many diseases 
doe transpire by insensible euaporation. 
[/43./] 
 
[}Doct.}] How shall wee come to the 
knowledge of the disease? 
 
[}Stud.}] Euery disease is knowne either 
from things substantially inhering, as 
[^p.46^] 
in the composition of members, what 
doth abound, or what doth want, or 
whether it bee not sited in his right 
place. 
 
2. From the operation of the member 
being hurt. 
3. From the qualitie changed. 
4. From things going out of the body. 
5. From the times of the yeare. 
 
Wee must know also that euery disease 
is either by essence, or by colligance 
[/44./] 
and consent. 
 
It is by essence if the disease be of it 
selfe in some member. 
 
It is by consent, if it be deriued from 
some member into another, by reason of 
the vicinitie and colligance of the same; 
as the affect of the head from some vapour 
arising from the stomack: neither 
must we be ignorant, that sometimes a 
disease is not only essential, but accidental 
also, & a companio~ of other diseases, 
[/45./] 
so sometimes a feuer is an accident of 
many diseases, and of it selfe no disease: 
and so often times there hapneth Apostums, 
and Tumors. 
 
[}Doct.}] How shall we know the cause 
of the disease? 
 
[^p.47^] 
[}Stud.}] Hip. affirmeth that there are 
three causes and beginnings of all diseases: 
for euery disease springeth either 
from repleton, or from the intemperature 
of the heauens, or through some externe 
violence happening vnto the 
body. 
 
[}Doct.}] What must we doe, when wee 
know the cause of the disease? 
 
[}Stud.}] The cause being knowne, we 
must proceed to medicines, and diet,and 
if need be to topicall meanes and chirurgery, 
prouiding alwaies a contrary 
medicine to the cause of the disease. 
 
Wee must therefore at the beginning 
vse vniuersall remedies, then wee 
must proceed to particular, as the disease 
shall require; and the Physitian 
must remember, that contraria contrarijs 
[/46./] 
curantur: & similia similibus sibi 
præbere adiumentum: so any kind of disease 
that doth proceede of repletion, 
will require emptines, and so on the 
contrary: and a disease that doth proceed 
of drinesse will require humectation 
and moystning: euen as 
that same which doth proceed of 
[^p.48^] 
heate will require refrigeration and 
cooling &c. 
 
[/47./] 
Notwithstanding, we must take heed 
that we doe not apply any thing that is 
extreame contrary, especially Repercioussius, 
lest we cause hurt to some principall member. 
 
[}PARS 4.}] 
 
[}Doct.}] WHen we haue found out 
a fit remedie for the disease, 
how must we proceed to the cure? 
 
[}Stud.}] It is to no end to find out a remedie, 
vnles the same bee vsed and applied 
wisely: for wee may find some 
Physitians that are furnished with a 
world of remedies, and yet apply them 
without either wit or reason: there be others 
that bee of good iudgement, and 
yet notwithstanding are very barraine 
of helpes, but those which they haue are 
very choice and good: and truly I know 
not how it doth happen, that there are 
so few sound and iudiciall Physitions in 
this our age. But to let that passe, in the 
administration of physicke, these three 
circumstances are to be considered, viz. 
[^p.49^] 
[/48./] 
Quantum, Quando, Quomode. For suppose 
the remedie be hotte or cold, a purger 
of flegme, melancholy, or choler: it 
is the worke of inuention, the cause and 
kind of the disease being considered, to 
dispose the remedy in a iust quantity: to 
prescribe the same in a conuenient form, 
and when it becommeth to offer the 
same according to iudgement and reason. 
 
And surely, there is nothing so hard, 
or so obscure in the practise of physick, 
as to deliuer a iust dose of medicine: neither 
can the quantity of a remedy be defined, 
except wee take the indication 
from things natural, as from the stre~gth, 
nature, and temperature of the sicke, the 
habit of the body, as fatnesse, leanenesse, 
[/49./] 
thinnes, fleshines, age, sexe, and custome; 
for that is another nature. In like maner 
from things not naturall; as the 
time, the aire, the region: from things auoyded, 
and from things retained; and 
those things which are præter naturam, against 
nature; as sickenes, the cause, and 
the symptoms. For what wise man will 
giue one & the same medicine to a weak 
man & to a strong, to a woman and to a 
[^p.50^] 
man, to a child and a yong man, to an 
Englishman and to a Moore? The time 
of the yeare is also to be regarded, the 
month, the disease, the Paroxisme; the 
cause also is to be considered; besides the 
vehemency and violence of the symptoms; 
and according to the same, the 
dose of the remedy is to be increased or 
diminished; for great diseases require remedies 
in a greater dose. But commonly 
vnto an Infant ij drag of Cassia is sufficient, 
of Manna iij. drag, of Rhubarbe 
infused ij. scruples; but to those that be of 
strength may be giuen j ounce of Cassia; 
and of Manna an ounce and a halfe: 
& of Rhubarb ij dra_[^ORIG. BLANK^] wil scarcely suffice. 
But as I haue said, these things can hardly 
be defined by art, but must be referred 
to the iudgement and discretion of 
the learned Physition. 
 
[}Doct.}] Let me now know your medicins 
[/50./] 
that you haue to purge choler. 
 
[}Stud.}] I haue to purge choler, Rhubarb, 
Cassia, Manna, Myrabalans Citrine, 
Aloes, and such like. 
 
[}Doct.}] These are simple medicines; let 
me know your compounds. 
 
[^p.51^] [^Original misnumbered as p.37.^] 
[}Stud.}] Then I haue Diaprunum simplex, 
and Solutiuum, Elect. de succo ros. hiera 
picra Galeni, &c. 
 
[}Doct.}] What purgers of flegme haue 
you? 
 
[}Stud.}] I haue Agaricke, Turbith, Colocinthis, 
[/51./] 
Carthamus, &c. Of compounds I 
haue Benedicta lax, hiera Ruffi, hiera picra, 
hiera logadij, Diacarthanni, Diaturpeti, Electuarium 
decitro, Diaphnicon, Indum Maius, 
& Minus, &c. 
 
[}Doct.}] What Pils haue you for that 
purpose? 
 
[/52./] 
[}Stud.}] I haue pilulas exagarico, cochiæ, 
Lucis, Arthreticæ, ex hermodactilis, ex cupatorio, 
e hiera, Alophanginæ, ex euphorbio, e 
castorio, e quinq, myrobolanis, ex mezereo, &c. 
 
[}Doct.}] Now proceed to your purgers 
[/53./] 
of melancholy. 
 
[}Stud.}] Sena orientalis, Epithymus, Eileborus 
niger, Lapis Lazuli, and Lapis Armeniacus, 
doe purge melancholy. 
 
The compounds are Diasena, Diacatholici, 
hiera Ruffi, and trifera sarasenica. 
And it is to be obserued, that hiera Ruffi 
doeth purge the head, the stomacke, 
and the whole bodie from grosse aud 
viscid humors, and withal black choler: 
[^p.52^] 
wherefore it is giuen in Mania, in Epilepsia, 
in oris tortura, paralysis, & melancholia, 
flatus discutit, stomachi concoctionem iuuat, 
& est medicamentum conferens fistulis, vlceribus 
cancrosis, & Lepra. 
 
[}Doct.}] What pils haue you to purge 
melancholy? 
 
[}Stud.}] Pilulæ e fumo-terræ, ex ellebero, ex 
Lapide Lazuli, ex Epithymo, pil. ftidæ. All 
these purge melancholy. 
 
[}Doct.}] Tell me now the iust dose of 
euery one of these medicines. 
 
[}Stud.}] I haue said already that that 
can hardly be declared, but must be referred 
to the discretion of the Physition: 
which for the most part doe not exceed 
six drammes of purging Electuaries; in 
which is no Scamony, nor aboue foure 
drammes of those Electuaries, in which 
is Scamony. As for pils, they neuer giue 
more then a dram or foure scruples. 
 
But we must note, that the colder the 
Region, the greater may the dose of purging 
medicines be. 
 
[}Doct.}] Doth not Confectio hamech purge 
melancholy? 
 
[}Stud.}] I must confesse that Confect. humech, 
is good against sicknesses proceeding 
[^p.53^] 
from blacke choler, and humours 
adusted, as in mania, melancholia, vertigine, 
obliuione, and in ægritudinibus cutanijs, as 
Scabbes, Morphue, Leprosie, and such 
like. 
 
[}Doct.}] With what waters must wee 
giue those Electuaries that do purge melancholy? 
 
[}Stud.}] We giue them in aqua fumo-terræ, 
and in aqua lupulorum; both which 
doeth respect the melancholicke humour. 
 
[}Doct.}] With what pils doe you purge 
mixt humors from the stomacke? 
 
[}Stud.}] To purge mixt humous from 
the stomacke, I vse: 
 
Pil. De tribus fernelij. 
Pil ex hilicacabo, &c. 
 
And when I purge generally all humours, 
I vse Pil. Aggregratinæ, and Panchimagogon, 
&c. 
 
[}Doct.}] Let mee know your remedies 
that you giue in a liquid forme: as Apozems, 
Syrups, Iulips, Potions, and infusions. 
 
[}Stud.}] You shall, and first it is to bee 
[/54./] 
obserned: that the Arabicks did inuent 
those kind of remedies, rather to open 
[^p.54^] 
then to purge. And this is the counsell 
of Hippocrates, Corpora cum quis purgare vole, 
toportet fluida reddere. And if the disease 
be not too acute, and the humour 
doe not abound, it is then the worke 
of Physicke to purge that which is digested 
and concocted; and not that 
which is crude, tough, and raw. The 
body is made fluxible by opening of the 
meatus and passages; by which the hurtful 
humors are drawne, and those grosse 
humors are incided and made thin: for 
otherwise the expelling of crude and vndigested 
humors, might cause a fretting 
and erosion of the intestines and bowels, 
and sometimes bloody fluxes: neither 
is any thing sent forth to any purpose; 
for when as all the humours are 
crude and dull, and vnfit to be moued, 
by reason of the thickenes and coldnesse 
thereof; it hapneth that all the narrow 
passages descending vnto the belly, remaine 
obstucted and stopped: neither 
is the grosse matter it selfe auoyded, but 
it is also an hinderance vnto that which 
is attenuated & made fluxible: for which 
cause, as I haue said, these kind of medicines 
were first inuented. An Apozem 
may be made with roots, hearbes, seeds, 
[^p.55^] 
fruits, & flowrs, with water and hony or 
sugar boiled together: or in this order, 
which is easie: Rec. Guaiacilib. +s Coquatur 
lento igne in vj. libris aquæ ad tertias, Colaturæ 
adde Si vis parum Sacchari, ad gratiam 
& hydroticum Apozema feceris. 
 
For some inward grief, of which there 
is no manifest cause. Rec. Florum Chamomeli 
[/55./] 
P. ij. more or lesse Coquantur, Colaturæ 
+o iij you may ad if you wil Sacchari 
+o j. Anod. [^ORIG. BLURRED^] erit Apozema. And this 
is the difference betweene a syrup, & an 
Apozem; that the syrupe is more grosse 
in consistence, then an Apozem, for that 
is more cleere and liquid: for syrups are 
made with more hony or suger, & so boiled 
together, vntill it be brought into a 
light body, that it may hang vpon the 
naile, or flicke being dropped vpon a 
marble stone. An Apozem is made by 
adding of lesser suger hony, or syrups to 
a decoction; for they must not be boiled 
together, but to the intent it may be 
the cleerer, and more gratefull to sight: 
it is to be clarified with the white of an 
egge.
