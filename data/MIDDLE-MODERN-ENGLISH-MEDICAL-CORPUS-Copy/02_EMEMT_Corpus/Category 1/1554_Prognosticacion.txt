[}Pronosticacion of the Feuer or 
Ague, whiche is called in laten 
Febris offimera.}] 
 
THat feuer after Auicen is 
lyght to heale, and harde 
to knowe. He y=t= knoweth 
it can saye and afferme 
the same. For the feuer I 
Effirme of his kynde dureth not, but 
by space of one naturall daye. And 
therfore he is named, or taketh his 
name of Effimeron a worde of greke 
whiche is a name of a certayne fysshe 
in laten. For that fysshe dyeth y~ same 
daye that he is gendred. And so it is 
of this Feuer, for of his nature he endureth 
but .xxiiij. houres. And then he 
endeth and goeth awaye with vaperouse 
swete. Notwithstandyng by derasion 
of yll gouernaunce, and some 
nature of the body, he endureth somtyme 
the space of a daye inclusyue, and 
yf it laste longer it is not the effomer 
[^f.A2v^] 
Ague. And therfore yf the pulse doth 
not reste soone after. And yf the pulse 
be dyuers and the matyer vndygested 
it is a token that it passeth into a putred 
Feuer especyally with stenche of 
these whiche co~meth forthe from the 
body of the persone. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the Feuer 
or ague called in laten 
Febris canson.}] 
 
THis dissease is very soone ended 
and with terryble or ferefull accydentes, 
and yf all the token appere 
good fro begynnynge of the disease, 
the pacyent shall be delyuered in the 
.4. day or within. And yf they apere yll 
he shall dye the .iiij. daye or within, but 
sometyme it contynueth tyll the .vij. 
daye, It cannot be prolonged farther 
For nature of the disease, and molestion 
of the accidentes doth not suffre 
it to be tedyous or of longe contynuaunce 
[^f.A3r^] 
It is not accordynge necessary 
to put the good and euyll Sygnes of 
the Agues here, for we haue put them 
in another place. Notwithstandynge 
Ipocras wolde Pronostycke that Alienocion 
doth dyssolue any trymblynges, 
eyther shakynges, that are caused 
of the Feuer Canson. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the 
Feuer Tercian.}] 
 
A Trewe Tercian is ended in .7. 
poyntes or within, and so is ended 
the .9. poynte or within. And he 
causeth payne & vexacio~ .12. houres or 
within. And the meane season it is 
moch paynful he vexeth .36. dayes. In 
the fyrste poynte it is lytell and weke. 
In the seconde poynte stronge. And in 
the thyrde most strongest. At the .ix. it 
is in the last. And there it aresteth w~ 
moste daungerouse and wycked accydentes. 
At the .5. poynte it begynneth 
to waxe weake. 
 
[^f.A3v^] 
[}Pronosticacion of the 
blody feuer.}] 
 
YF yelowe or blacke whelkes do apere, 
or as Auicen sayth, yf the 
pacient harde sownde or rumblyng in 
his belly lyke thunder, or yf his eyes 
water by reason of malyce of the dysease; 
Or yf he can scant drawe his 
breth, or be stopped, or haue impostumes 
in the wayes where as the breth 
doth passe. And yf ye perceyue hym verye 
paynefull after slepe. All these are 
tokens of death. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the 
feuer quartan.}] 
 
THe feuer quartan of blode is sooner 
heled and shorter then other 
of other Humours. Then nexte that 
whiche is of colour. Then that which 
is of flewme. Then the worst of Melancoly. 
The feuer quartan after his 
commen course lasteth a yeare. For as 
[^f.A4r^] 
the sharpe Agues folowe the mouyng 
of the Moone, so doth the Cronyckes 
folowe mouynge of the Sonne. And 
somtyme it lasteth .2. yeres, as Auicen 
sayth. And yf the pacient vse yll dyet 
longe, he dyeth of it. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the 
Cotidian Feuer.}] 
 
YF we may perceyue in the begynnynge 
wylfull vomet, and in the 
ende of the fyt swete, it is a very good 
token. For that betokeneth that the 
syckenes is curable and shorte, for of 
that is sygnyfyed y~ the mattier is not 
very grose, and viscouse and the pores 
are not thycke. This desease commeth 
lyghtly with moche nesynges and alteracions 
with a certayne astonyenges, 
and lytell thurste with swellynge 
and payne of the face, and they falleth 
lyghtly into swete, and haue contynuall 
payne of the stomacke. 
 
[^f.A4v^] 
[}Pronosticacion of the 
Feuer Ethycke.}] 
 
THe fyrste kynde of it is soone heled, 
but the thyrde neuer, but by 
the power of GOD. But the meane is 
of meane maner. So that yf it be cured 
it is with great diffycultie, whan 
his nayles croketh, then is he in the 
state certayne to dye, but whan his 
heart falleth then is he nere death. 
And yf he chaunce to haue y~ flux or laske, 
then is he at poynte of death. For 
that destroyeth of the pacyent verye 
soone, when his legges begynneth to 
swell, then can he lyue no longer, but 
commonlye they dye within .3. dayes. 
And the pacyentes of the Feuer quartan 
Ethycke, can not well deserne of 
heate for the dyuers yll complection, 
is made equal, and it is not feled, and 
whan the feuer Ethycke is compounde 
with the putred mattier, he is harde 
to be knowen. 
 
[^f.B1r^] 
[}Pronosticacion of 
Swete.}] 
 
THE swete ryseth from the place 
where the mattier of the dysease 
is, or nere it. Where the swete is, 
there is the syckenes. The swete whiche 
co~meth now and then is nought. 
Swete with wekenes of the pulse, is 
nought. Hote swete in the hede, in the 
contynual feuer onely is nought. And 
yf it be colde, it betokeneth death. Yf 
the Ague be sharpe and slowe, it betokeneth 
length of the dysease. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
the pockes.}] 
 
YF they be fewe and aperynge soone, 
and that they mater soone, it 
is token of good lykelyhod of cure, by 
cause the crises or corrupte humours 
that they are gendred of, is good to 
hele. But yf they turne towarde the 
[^f.B1v^] 
colour of Uiolettes, yelowe or grene, 
eyther blacke. All these are the worst 
and deadly. Yf a poyson or venomous 
mattier apere, it is deadly. Yf they apere 
somtyme and somtyme are hyd, 
that is the worst sygne of all. Also yf 
the pacyent can not well drawe his 
breath it is a very yll sygne, but yf he 
may drawe his breath, well, and is w~out 
feuer, it is a good sygne. But yf 
the Ague be stronge with the pockes, 
and great anguysshe, and vehement 
thurst, of weke strength and the breth 
bounde. It is a token that he shall 
dye soone. As commonly they dye by 
stoppynge of theyr breth. Yf pantyng 
ouer all, it is very euyll. And yf his 
Uryne be blacke or grene, and yf the 
egestion be grene. These are worst and 
deadly Sygnes, and so is laske with 
Pockes. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
Poyson.}] 
 
[^f.B2r^] 
THese are deadly sygnes, he that 
receyueth poyson, yf the apple of 
his eye be hyd, and the whyte of his 
eyes doth apere onely swellynge of his 
face and throte, and chaungynge of 
colour into yelowe or blacke, and grenenes, 
or blackenes of tonge, and puttynge 
out of it, and very moche spyttyng 
payne of his guttes, the crampe 
and pantyng. These sygnifyeth death 
within certayne yeares. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
Impostumes.}] 
 
SOme Impostumes are ended by in 
sensyble resolucion, and is verye 
good, and some be poyson matyrynge, 
and that is worst, some by meane laudable 
matyrynge, and that is good, 
and some by grauell and hardenes, 
and that is yll. Some Impostumes 
are of hote matier, and they are ended 
in a daye. And some are of colde 
matier and they are ended in the .40. 
[^f.B2v^] 
day, also euery Impostume of aduste 
mattier, as Antrax, Cabutulus, and 
Formica, are worst and mortall, and 
yf these be with Ague, the pacient escapeth 
but sylde, and yf it be in places 
streyght agaynst the herte, or aboute 
it is mortall, and yf it vanysshe 
away sodenly, it is deadly, and yf the 
matier turne to the inwarde partes, 
than the pacyent beareth doth vpon 
his Feete. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the 
Morphewe.}] 
 
YF the morphewe be newe it is curable, 
or els it is vncurable. If 
the Morphewe occupy but a lytell space 
it is curable, and yf it be of a great 
space it is harde of cure. Yf the place 
of the Morphewe be prycked with a 
Nedle in the ouer parte of the skynne 
onely, so that it doth not passe farther 
than thorowe the skynne, and yf 
[^f.B3r^] 
blode come forth, it is curable, and yf 
watrenes come, it is vncurable. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of woundes, 
strokes, and strypes.}] 
 
WOundes of the inwarde parte, or 
bowelles with snynyll or perbrekynge, 
and laske is very euyll, and yf 
the Crampe come with/ as happen 
commonly they dyeth, and yf they haue 
pantynge with sownynges, death 
is at hande. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
whelkes.}] 
 
ALL whelkes yf they be not made 
clene, but lefte neclygentlye, 
they turne to scabbes, and yf it be of 
a colde cause, it groweth to Tetters, 
Ryngwormes and other yll accidentes. 
And yf it be of flewme after the 
scabbe, it is turned to Fistula, and yf 
[^f.B3v^] 
it be of melancoly, suche are of harde 
cure, and yf they be let passe necligently, 
they growe to a Canker. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
the scall.}] 
 
THe scall that is eyther newe, or 
olde, and yf be it newe it is lyghtly 
heled, & yf it be olde, it is heled with 
great labour, or in a very longe tyme 
for the yll applexcion commeth to so 
great adustion that it wyll not take 
healynge. And therfore yf it be healed 
the heare groweth but sylde in that 
place. And that place shall be weaker 
alwaye, and yf they be heled it shall be 
rebuke to them. For they shall be called 
pyllardes. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
the frensy.}] 
 
CAlyen in his pronostyckes vpon 
that parte sayth mouyng of handes 
[^f.B4r^] 
doth sygnyfye that dysease. And 
where he sayth that frensy is perlous 
in euery kynde of it. That frensy is 
worst that is in the substaunce of the 
maries, and the nexte that is worste 
whiche is the meeke mother, or fast 
mother. Then that is in the hard mother. 
But that frensy that is of the 
redde and aduste or burned coloure is 
worst of all. Then that whiche is next 
to the aduste colour. Then that whiche 
is of blode. Then that whiche is 
of citryne colour & so of other. These 
are sygnes of death. Whan the Uryne 
is fyrste well coloured, and after is 
of whyte colour and thyn and continually 
so or other wyse alyenated from 
perfyte coloure, and contynuall watchynge. 
Lykewyse yf Uryne be holden 
and syckely, and yf the pacyent haue 
the crampe, and yf the legges be stratched 
out and can not be bowed well/ 
and whan they are stratched they can 
not be well bowed, and yf a blode apere 
[^f.B4v^] 
in the thombe and yf sownynges 
chaunce to the pacient, and whan these 
sygnes doth apere, then death sytteth 
at his feete. Therfore a pechien 
is necessarye. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the syckenes called 
in laten .Scotomia. For these 
are cosyns and louers of the 
fallyng syckenes Apolencia 
& Apoplexia.}] 
 
WHERfore whan they multyplye 
theyr euyll dysposycion they fall 
in to it. Therfore euery man ought to 
take hede dylygently for them. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of litargy or 
lyghtenes in the heade.}] 
 
COlde swete in the heade sygnyfyeth 
death. And yf a horse leche be 
put to his forheade yf he cleue not to 
it sygnyfyeth death, and yf there be 
[^f.C1r^] 
none of these sygnes, and the accidentes 
begyn to metigate contynually & 
naturall vertue to be stronge, it is a token 
of cure, or health nere at hande. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of Epyelnsia 
or of the fallynge euyll.}] 
 
YF a woman with chylde chaunce 
to haue the fallynge euyll. Yf she 
be delyuered of the chylde, she shalbe 
healed and delyuered also of the syckenes. 
And yf the whyte Morphewe 
chaunce to come in her hede it is a token 
of helth, and yf the chylde take any 
parte of the dysease in the mothers 
wombe, and vomete after and purge 
hym and anoyde moche superfluouse 
watry humours it is a token that he 
is delyuered of it, and yf not, not yf a 
man doubte whether one be delyuered 
of the epilence or not, fumigate him w~ 
gotes hornes, and yf he fall not he is 
heled. But yf he fall, he is not hole. 
 
[^f.C1v^] 
[}Pronosticacion of 
Appoplexio.}] 
 
AFter Ipocras and Auicen dyd 
Pronostike. I saye that I sawe 
many that had that dysease, but of 
Trueth I neuer sawe any escape it. 
Therfore Lorde delyuer vs from sodayne 
and euerlastynge death. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
the Palsey.}] 
 
YF grene Uryne apere in a chylde 
that hath the Ague, it betokeneth 
that he shall haue the palsey, or 
the Crampe. It is harde to heale the 
palsey in aged people, or neuer, yf tremblyng 
come vpon the palsey it is good 
yf the palsey come of moch disordring 
or straynyng of the synewes, or of moche 
byndynge of the synewes, or brekynge 
or cuttynge, it taketh not cure 
by the contrarye. And yf the membre 
[^f.C2r^] 
that hath the palsey be moche lasse. 
It is very yll, and yf not it is to hope 
of cure. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
the Crampe.}] 
 
THe Crampe that commeth of replenishyng, 
or fyllyng is curable 
for it is lyghter to dry a moyste thynge, 
than to make moyste a drye thyng 
as is wrytten in the .7. Chapi. of the 
Ingony. The crampe of woundes is 
dedly. The crampe of inaniton is also 
dedly. The crampe after feuers is 
dedly. The crampe after pryckynge of 
synewes is curable. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
Tremblynge}] 
 
TRemblynge is the waye for the 
crampe and palsey. It is not curable 
in aged people. Tremblynge is 
[^f.C2v^] 
worse in the left syde, than in y~ ryght 
syde, after Auicen. Tremblynge in the 
lower lyppe betokeneth vomet. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of bledyng at 
the nose thrylles.}] 
 
BLedynge at the nose whiche commeth 
of any cause of the brayne, 
is cured hardly or neuer. Bledynge at 
the nose whiche enlargeth it to .4. it 
is yll, and yf it enlarge to, or aboue .8. 
it is of most great daunger. And yf it 
passe aboue .xx. the pacient can lyue no 
longer. The bledyng whiche endureth 
tyll the pale, or grene colour, or wan, 
or browne colour, is worst and deadly. 
The bledyng that causeth sownes is 
dedly. Bledynge with colde of the nether 
partes is dedly. Euery bledynge 
that commeth sodenly or with great 
haste is yll. All bledynge with lyghtenynge 
of the pacient is good. 
 
[^f.C3r^] 
[}Pronosticacion of 
Nesynge.}] 
 
NEsynge in the ende of syckenesse 
is a good sygne after Galien, nesynge 
with rewme is yll, and in a full 
body and in a hote cause, and in sygnes 
that betokeneth an euyll cause in 
the head hurtynge the heade and yll in 
reason of the cause, for ouer moche nesynge 
fylleth the head, and also causeth 
swymmynge in the head and the 
dysease called scotomia in laten and 
other lyke. Yf nesynge be prouoked in 
any syckenes in whiche it ought to be 
prouoked, and yf the pacyent doth not 
nese, he shall neuer be hole. And yf he 
be prouoked with thynges of stronge 
vertue, as is Eleborus, Albus, Pepper, 
Castory, Mustarde sede, Euforbium 
and other lyke. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the disease 
of the tonge.}] 
 
[^f.C3v^] 
IN the sharpe Ague a blacke whelke 
aperynge vpon the tonge is sygne 
of death. In the sharpe Ague blackenes 
of the tonge & vlteracion is yll. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of payne 
in the teeth.}] 
 
IN the Feuers hurte, grenenes, and 
blackenes, by reason of the Ague, or 
leuers is the worst sygne. Slymenes 
in the teeth with Ague betokeneth longe 
syckenes. In the contynuall feuers 
yf the teth be drye as a stycke it is the 
worst sygne and it is dedly. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
the squance.}] 
 
THese are yll sygnes in the squance 
and they are daungerous & dedly. 
But whan the squance co~meth in 
the continuall feuers in a perlous day 
called in laten .Dies ceticus. Then 
[^f.C4r^] 
chaunceth to the pacyent a vehement 
entraunce, difficulte to swalowe mete 
so that he casteth drinke out agayn at 
his nose thrylles, and hath a shyll voyce, 
so that he sowneth to speake with 
his nose thrylles, he shall haue Fome 
in his mouth, and put out his tonge, 
and wyll moue it ofte in puttynge out 
As apereth in a horse that he is wery 
his mouth beynge full of fome he shall 
haue a wan blacke colour, he shall haue 
the toppe of his tonge, lyppes, and 
eyes colde. He wyll drawe into hy~ his 
necke, and shall be in suche case with 
payne that he can not lye on his backe, 
and especyally yf the squance be in the 
wayes of the breath, for whan it is in 
wayes of the mete, great payne is to 
swalowe the mete. How be it somtyme 
the both chaunseth. These are sygnes 
of the squance whiche is hyd within, 
that can not be sene. Restraynynge of 
the breth, and whan the pacient drynketh 
water, he anoydeth towarde the 
[^f.C4v^] 
nose thrylles, and the eyes are red, the 
tonge roughe, the necke roughe, and 
voyce shyll. The Squance commeth 
commenly in the sprynge tyme. And 
that is most peryllous that commeth 
with an Ague, but yf the lyuely sygnes 
are well, that is to say rest, slepe, lytell 
payne, good breth, good swalowynge 
of meate. And yf none of the yll sygnes 
apere whiche are spoken before than 
it is lyghtly curable. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of horsenes 
of Uoyce.}] 
 
HOrsenes in olde men is neuer heled, 
oneles it be very new. Horse 
taketh not cure after one yeare. Horse 
whiche commeth by occasyon of rewme 
is neuer heled except the rewme be 
fyrste heled. Whan a man is rewmatycke 
and horse and yf he be leten blod 
whan he is horse, scante or neuer shall 
he be healed. 
 
[^f.D1r^] 
[}Pronosticacion of the coughe 
commynge in Idropysy 
is euyll.}] 
 
MOche Coughynge with payne/ 
and grefe, and with moche prouokynge 
and horsenes and rednes of 
eyes, with lytell auoydynge is yll. And 
yf it be ofte is causeth rupture eyther 
borstines and then it signifieth deth. 
Who so hath the Ague and coughe togyther, 
and yf the Ague cease, and the 
coughe remayne it is token of recordynge, 
who so hath the moyste coughe 
and it cease sodenly with grefe which 
remayneth in the breest. It betokeneth 
that they haue the putryde ague 
eyther vlteracion of the lunges. For 
euery matyer that is moued by reason 
of the cough, and hath no passage 
forth the scrinth beyng weke it is dedly, 
for it choketh the way of the breth. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
Tysycke.}] 
 
[^f.D1v^] 
THe olde Tysycke taketh no cure 
For Auicen sayth that he sawe 
one that had the Tysycke whose lyfe 
was prolonged by .20. yeres, and Auicen 
sayth yf whelkes apere vpon his 
shulder blades, he shall dye within, 
52. dayes. Tokens that sheweth hym 
that hath the Tysycke which shall dye 
shortly, is fallynge of his heare, crokynge 
of his nayles, goynge away of 
his appetyte, hardenes to drawe his 
breth, holdynge of spyttyll, laske, and 
swellynge of his legges. And most co~monly 
they whiche haue the Tysycke 
hath it fallyng of the lefe, therfore, 
a man ought to be well ware in pronosticacion 
of tysycke. For in spekyng 
they dye and in dyenge they speake. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
pantynge.}] 
 
WHoso suffreth tremblynge of the 
harte a longe tyme, and yf pantynge 
[^f.D2r^]

yf any man suffre longe pantyng and 
coloure of his face be chaunged in to 
palenes, greenes, or blackenes, he shall 
neuer trede earth. Yf pantynge come 
sodaynly and withoute any manyfest 
cause. And yf the pantynge be longe. 
The matter is ended. Yf a nesyng medycyne 
be ministred to hym that hath 
pantynge, yf the poudre be cast in his 
nose thrylles, and yf he doth not nese, 
there is no counsayle, but that the bodye 
nede no medycyne. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of the hasty appetyte 
called the Dogges 
appetyte.}] 
 
THE hasty appetyte commeth of 
rewme but sylde, yf the hasty appetyte 
contynue, it bryngeth the pacyent 
to a dysease called in laten bolisinus. 
And bolisinus bryngeth hym in 
[^f.D2v^] 
to a pantynge hunger. And that hunger 
to death, therfore watche & pray. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
thurste.}] 
 
YF thurst in the ague with drynes 
of the body. It is very yll, yf one 
that hath the Ague thurste moche. 
And yf the thurst cese sodenly, and the 
Ague remayneth, and yf the tongue be 
dry and blacke. It betokeneth death 
without doubte. 
 
[}Pronosticacion of 
the Yockes.}] 
 
YF the Yockes be in the token called 
in laten Crisis, with good signes 
aperynge it is good. For it betokeneth 
crisis by vomete. And yf the 
crampe come after the yockes or alienacion, 
it is a very yll toke~. Yf it come 
after a purgacion be mynystred. Yockes 
after vomet is yll.

WHo soeuer hath this accustomably, 
can not auoyde the dysease 
called in laten catochia ydeapsy, swellynge 
of fete, face, and eyes. &c.
