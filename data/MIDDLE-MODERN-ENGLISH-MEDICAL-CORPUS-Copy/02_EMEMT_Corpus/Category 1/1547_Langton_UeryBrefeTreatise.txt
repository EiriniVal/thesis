[^f.A1r^] 
[}The fyrste Chapter. 
Of what kynde of artes 
Phisicke is.}] 
 
SEyng that I haue 
taken vpon me, to 
wryte a breefe treatyse 
vpon Phisicke, 
for the alonlye commoditie 
of ignoraunt and vnlearned 
studentes in the same, I think 
it very necessarye and expedient to 
open and declare, bothe playnlye, 
and brefely what physicke is, whiche 
in Latine is called Medicina, & 
in Englysshe woorde for woorde, 
Medicine. 
 
Hyppocrates in his boke de flatibus, 
whiche is as muche to saye, 
as in his boke of Spirites, or blastes, 
affirmeth that Medicine or 
Physicke, is nothyng, but the adiection 
of that that lacketh, or the 
[^f.A1v^] 
subtraction, or takynge awaye, of 
that whyche is superfluous, & redoundeth: 
the whych declaration 
or definition, Gallen alloweth in 
manye places, & trulie not w~out a 
cause: For ther is no parte of phisike 
but it is co~prehended in thys 
finition. Auerroes in the .vi. boke, 
and the .i. Chapiter, of his gatheringes 
dothe define phisicke verye 
fetely, in these wordes folowinge. 
Medic_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]na est ars factiuarum vna, ratione, 
et experimento inuenta, que 
tum sanitatem tuetur, tum morbum 
depellit. whiche is as muche to say 
in englysh, as Phisike is one of 
those artes whyche dothe make 
thinges inuented, or found out by 
reason and experience, and the 
whyche partly defendeth health, 
and partly beteth away disease, 
and siknes. 
[^f.A2r^] 
Herophilus woulde haue defined 
it, after this fashion. Medicina 
est scientia salubrium, insalubrium, et 
neutrorum. 
 
Whyche in englyshe is as foloweth. 
Physike is a science of 
thynges holsome, & vnholsome, 
and of neyther of bothe: Gallen 
vseth thys finition, in hys boke 
y~ is called ars medica, not because 
he doth so greatly alowe it, but 
because yt serueth hys pourpose, 
whyche is easie to be knowen of 
that, that foloweth: where he sayeth 
that this worde scientia, must 
be taken in that place, accordynge 
to hys common significatyon, 
and not as it signifyeth properlye: 
wherefore phisike is an arte, 
and no science, and seynge yt is 
an arte, I thynke yt well donne, 
[^f.A2v^] 
to shewe in what kynde of artes 
it is: For there be many differences 
of Artes, but especiallye .iiii. 
One is called in Latyne, Contemplatoria 
whiche hath his ende only 
in the seyng and beholdyng of 
thynges, and maye well be called 
contemplacion or knowlege, suche 
is Arithmetick, Astronomie, & natural 
philosophie, for ther is none 
of these artes that doth any thing 
but is onlye ended in contemplacion 
and studye. 
 
There is an other which is called 
in Latyn, Actiua, in Englysh practise, 
and consisteth in doynge, as 
dawnsyng, and harpyng, wyth other 
lyke. 
 
The thyrde in Latyn maye be called 
Factiua, which besyde the practise 
and studye, leaueth behynde 
his woorke, as payntyng, & buyldyng, 
[^f.A3r^] 
and of this kynde there be 
two artes, for some make the workes 
them selues, as weuyng & tanning, 
and some correct and amend 
the thynges, whan they be made: 
as botchyng and clowtyng of old 
garmentes houses, & other thi~ges 
The fowerth in Latyn is called 
comparans, which in our tong may 
be called a gettyng arte, for it doeth 
make nothynge, but by studye, 
& industry getteth certen thynges 
as fysshynge and huntyng, these 
truly do make nothyng: but their 
study & labor is to get somthyng. 
And to be brefe, Phisicke as Gallen 
sayeth, is a kynde of those Artes 
whiche restoreth theyr woorkes 
nowe alreadye done, and correcteth 
the same, and not of them 
whiche make theyr workes newe. 
For Phisicke of her selfe maketh 
[^f.A3v^] 
not her examples, as the arte of 
buyldyng, knyttyng, and weuing 
dothe. But as that arte that mendeth 
olde houses, and piceth olde 
garmentes: so phisike doth amend 
the euyll constitution of mannes 
bodye. 
 
[}The seconde Chapiter. 
Of the sectes in phisyke.}] 
 
YT is nowe alredye 
shewed, that phisike 
is an arte which restoreth 
healthe beynge 
absent, and defendeth 
the same beynge present, 
but howe thys art maye be gotten 
yt is not agreed vpon amongest 
all men, for some thynke experience 
sufficiente to the gettyng 
of this arte, and do cal them 
selfes therof Empericos. These be 
they that haue ther firste respect 
[^f.A4r^] 
vnto the heape of accidentes, and 
begynneth their cure of them, 
wythout any knowledge ether of 
the disease, or the cause, and they 
call the forsayde heape of accidentes 
in Greke, [^GREEK OMITTED^], the whyche 
in Lattyn is called Congeries, 
and concursus, and in Englishe a 
heape, or concurryng, or runnynge 
to gether. Secundarilye, 
they obserue, and marke, in the 
cummynge to gether of Accidentes, 
Medicines which they know 
to be mete for the disease, onlye by 
vse and experience. Thyrdely they 
lerne remedies of the historie, of 
suche as they haue before proued: 
fowerthly they goe from lyke, to 
lyke. 
 
For what soeuer remedyes 
they haue proued by experience, 
in manye men, and often tymes 
[^f.A4v^] 
(but alwayes they proue them in 
the same and lyke measure, orelles 
by chaunce, and as a man woulde 
saye vnloked for, they marke and 
obserue them to be lyke, & to haue 
one effect) the same they vse boldly, 
nothyng curiouse in the inquyryng 
what facultie or nature they 
be of, that is to saye whether they 
be hote or colde, drye or moyste, & 
they beleue and credit the olde auncientes, 
whiche hath lefte in wrytyng, 
suche thynges as they haue 
noted and obserued by experience, 
& that y~ the~ selues haue obserued 
& marked, they cal in Greke, [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
whiche in Englysh, maye be 
called theyr owne inspection, and 
looke what they haue obserued, & 
marked by chaunce, as yf a ma~ by 
fallyng from hygh, be wou~ded, or 
hurte, or els yf a man beyng sicke 
[^f.A5r^] 
and folowyng his appetite, dri~ke 
colde water, the whiche hath eyther 
done good or euyll, they call 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], which is to saye an obseruacion 
made by chaunce. 
But whan they learne that that is 
marked by other, they call it in 
Greke, [^GREEK OMITTED^] whiche may be called 
the obseruation of other. 
 
They vse also to go from lyke to 
lyke, whiles they intermedle with 
suche thi~ges, as they haue not yet 
proued, althoughe they be of one 
kynde, and this is called of them 
in greke, [^GREEK OMITTED^], which 
in englysh is a goyng from lyke to 
lyke, and by this rule they transfer 
one medicine to dyuers euyls, and 
from one place affected to another 
& from one medicine whiche they 
knewe before, to an other of the 
same kynde vnknowen. 
[^f.A5v^] 
The beginner of thys secte, was 
Philinus Cous, and Acro Agrige~tinus, 
after these was Serapion 
Alexandreus, wyth other mo. 
Besyde these, ther be other, whyche 
name them selues Methodicos, 
because they folowe a brefe 
compendiouse waye in phisike, as 
though no man had wrytten of 
that arte before them, in any order: 
these men doe not only differ 
from the other sectes in wordes, 
but also take vpon them to inuent 
many newe thynges, in phisicke. 
For they saye playnlye, that nether 
the place affected, nether the 
cause of the dysease, nether the 
age of the syke, nether the tyme of 
the yere, nether the nature of the 
cuntrey, nether the strength of the 
[^f.A6r^] 
pacient, nether the habit, or the 
constitution, of the sicke mannes 
body, nether his former lyfe & dyet, 
doth profyt any thyng at all, to 
the curyng of the disease: therfore 
all these thinges set asyde, they 
thynke it sufficient. to haue a respect 
only to the disease. They wyl 
haue nothynge particular, but al 
common, therfore they stablished 
certayne common rules, whyche 
in Greke, they called [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
one of ther common rules is, that 
euerye disease, is eyther the byndinge 
of the bellye, or els of sume 
other parte of the body, or els the 
ouer muche openyng of the same, 
or finallye, the ouer muche openynge 
and shuttyng bothe to gether 
in one parte of the bodye, as 
in example. 
[^f.A6v^] 
Yf the naturall egestions be holden 
to long, then the party hath a 
byndyng disease they saye: but yf 
they runne to muche, that they call 
an open disease: And yf a man be 
bothe bounde and lewse together, 
than they call that sycknes a combynation 
of bothe the fornamed euyls: 
as yf the eye shoulde suffer 
a fluxe, and an inflammation together, 
of the whiche, the inflammation 
is a sycknes that byndeth, 
and the fluxe an open disease: then 
theyr remedye in suche a case, is to 
bynde that that runneth, and to open 
that that is bou~de, as if there 
be any inflammation in the shoulder 
or arme, what is their rule. 
what, but withoute deliberation, 
or consideration of the place affected, 
strayght to lewse the bellye, & 
yf it fortune bothe the forsayde euyls 
[^f.A7r^] 
to chau~ce at one tyme, in one 
membre, then what do they vtterly 
neglect that that is of the least 
daunger: and these be they which 
reprehende Hyppocrates, because 
he sayeth that physicke is a longe 
arte, and that mannes lyfe is but 
shorte, for they saye that it is not 
so, but rather cleane contrary. For 
as they saye, yf al that is superfluous 
were cut out, phisicke myghte 
be easily learned in .vi. monethes. 
The begynner of this secte, was 
Syrus, Asclepiades scholer: after 
whome came Thessalus, Proclus, 
and manye other. 
 
Moreouer there be other which 
be called Dogmatici, because they 
grounde all theyr doynges vppon 
reason. These do learne diligently 
the nature and co~stitution of all 
suche bodyes as they take in hand 
[^f.A7v^] 
to heale: and doe marke verye dilygently, 
euerye day, the alterations 
of the same, besyde this, they 
say, that yt is euerye honest Phisition 
hys part, to know, and consyder 
well, both the nature of the 
ayer, waters, and wyndes, and 
the place also wher the sycke abydethe, 
and his accustomed diet, as 
well in meates, and drinkes, as 
bathes, exercises, & other thinges, 
to the end, that he may haue a sure 
knowledge, bothe of the causes, & 
remedyes, of all diseases. They 
wyll also that he be suche an one, 
that he be able, to proue by reason, 
what nature any kynde of medicyne 
hath, and that he be able to 
apoynt, (though he neuer sawe yt 
before) what yt is able to doe, 
and they counsel euery Phisition, 
to begynne his cure, accordyng to 
[^f.B1r^] 
the strength of the sick, and not as 
y~ disease paraduenture shall wyll 
hym: And they doe not denye, 
but that experience is necessarye, 
howbeit they denye it to be sufficient 
to cure all malledies, and to 
finde, and serche out, all thynges. 
And also they say, y~ without reson, 
experience can hardly be come 
by. The first author, and founder 
of this sect, was Hyppocrates 
Lous, withoute dowt, the moste 
lerned, and noble Phisition, that 
euer was, after hym came Diocles, 
Praxagoras, and Chrysyppus, 
w~ many mo, no lesse lerned, 
then famouse. 
 
[}The .iii. chapter. 
The partes of phisicke}] 
 
THere be .vi. especiall partes 
of phisicke, the firste 
dothe considere the constitucion 
[^f.B1v^] 
of mannes nature, & bodie. 
The second defendeth the bodie 
from sycknes, kepynge it in 
healthe. The third inquireth the 
causes, and accidentes, of sicknes, 
and diseases. The forthe conteyneth 
the knowledge as well of 
thinges past, as also present, and 
to come. The fifth showeth an order, 
and a way, how all diseases, 
shoulde be healed: and this part, 
is deuyded into thre other partes. 
The firste of the thre, techeth the 
healing of sicknesses, by diet only, 
and therefore it is both the chefe, 
and moste noble parte of phisicke, 
and without the which, the other 
partes, which serue to the helyng 
of diseases, can not be: and hereof 
it is, that Hippocrates wrot thre 
great bokes of the remediynge of 
[^f.B2r^] 
all feruent diseases, by diet onlye, 
in the which boke, he proueth euydently, 
that of a lytell faut or error 
in the diet of suche as be sycke, foloweth 
death without remedy, the 
whiche thing yf it be true, as vndoutedlye 
it is, what be such Phisitions 
worthye, as doe vtterlye 
necglect the same, and thinke that 
they haue done a great feat, whan 
they haue wrytten a byl or two, to 
the appoticarie, takynge no care 
in the meane tyme, what manner 
of dyet, the sicke kepeth. 
 
The seconde parte, healeth by 
medicins inwarde, & outwardly 
taken. But there be medicins of .ii. 
sortes, that is to say simple, and 
compounde, and first to the parfit 
curyng of the disease most necessary 
is the knowledge of the simple 
[^f.B2v^] 
and this care whiche is a greate 
charge, is commytted to such, as 
be vnlerned, yea and in many places 
(more is the pittie) to folish, & 
ignorant wemen: I wolde rather 
wishe, the handlynge of suche Iuelles, 
to be in the handes, of y~ best 
lerned, and wysest Phisitions: 
For as it is a thinge to be laughhed 
at, if a Paynter know not his 
pensill, or a coblar hys nail, or a 
tannar his lether, so think ye that 
a Phisition is not to be laught to 
scorne: yf he know not the matter 
of that arte, which he professeth. 
But now adayes he is most set 
by; and had in the gretest estimation, 
which knoeth y~ least, & which 
can make one medicine serue a 
thowsande diuerse diseases, whiche 
is as lyke to be true, as one 
shooe to be mete & fit for so many 
[^f.B3r^] 
feet. And as for medicins, they be 
not worth a vyle straw, except they 
com out of Ethiop, Arabi, or India, 
wheras for vs english men, 
ther is non so good, as our owne 
Englishe simples: For it can not 
be proued, y~ nature euer brought 
forthe any wher liuing creatures, 
where as she left nothing to fede 
them wyth all, and lykewyse as 
she hath prouided meat, so hath she 
medicyns also, but the suttylties 
of men, for their owne gayne, and 
priuat Lucre, hath browght to 
passe that al thing is oute of order, 
bothe in the shoppes of the appoticaries, 
and other places elles 
where. The thyrd part is Surgery, 
which is wrought by mannes 
hand, which Gallen commendeth 
hyghly, in many, and sundry 
bokes. 
 
[^f.B3v^] 
[}The .iiii. chapter. 
The distribution of Phisicke 
in to thre 
formes.}] 
 
OUre forfathers haue 
distributed, and deuided 
Phisicke, into 
thre formes, or orders, 
and that for no 
other pourpose, but that yonge 
studentes of Phisick, might lerne 
diligently, and a gret dele the better 
remember, what so euer they 
had red, in the monumentes of 
olde writers. The first order is of 
those thinges, of y~ whiche, ma~nes 
body is made of, and it hath plesed 
the foresayde elders, to call suche 
thinges, as oure body is co~pact, & 
made of thinges natural, because 
to the perfection of mannes body 
they be necessary. 
 
[^f.B4r^] 
The seconde order, is of those 
thinges, with the which, oure bodye 
is nourished, that yt may remayne 
in healthe: & these thinges 
be called not naturall, not because 
they be vtterlye agaynst oure nature, 
but because if they be geuen 
without discrecio~, they may make 
suche alteration in the bodye, as 
may extinguishe and abolishe vtterlye, 
the lyfe. 
 
The thirde order, is of such as 
hurt, and harme the body, and corrupt 
it, & therfore, they be called, 
thinges agaynste nature, because 
they be clene 
contrary to 
nature. 
 
[}The fyfth chapter. 
Of the number of 
thinges naturall.}] 
 
[^f.B4v^] 
NOwe it is tyme to 
speke of the first part 
of Phisicke, whiche 
entreateth of the naturall 
co~stitution of 
mannes bodie, & this part of Phisicke, 
is not put firste, without a 
cause: For no ma~ can do any good 
with a medicyne, whiche is ignorant 
in the constitutio~ of mannes 
bodie, therfore the thinges naturall 
wherof mannes bodye is conpact 
& made, be seuen in number. 
1 Elementes: as the fiere, ayer, 
water, and erthe. 
2 Temperamentes: as hote, 
cowlde, moyst, and drye. 
3 Humores: as blowde, fleume, 
chollar bothe yelow & black. 
4 Partes: as flesh, bone, brayne 
harte, liuer, heed, and handes. 
5 Faculties: as Animall, vitall, & 
[^f.B5r^] 
naturall. 
6 Actions: as Animall, & naturall. 
7 Spirites: as animall, vitall, 
and naturall. 
These thinges I entend (god willing) 
to expresse so well as the sterillite 
of my simple wyt, will geue 
me leaue, begynnyng first wyth 
the Elementes. 
 
[}The sixte, chapter. 
Of the Elementes.}] 
 
TUlly y~ eloquent Romain, 
counselleth very 
wel euery man~, first 
of all and before he 
make any far procedynge, 
to defyne the thing, of the 
which he pourposeth to entreat, to 
y~ entent that euery ma~ may perceyue 
what it is y~ is spoke~ of therfore 
according to his counsell I 
[^f.B5v^] 
wyll fyrst define what an element 
is: wherfore an element, (as Galen 
sayeth in the .viii. boke of the 
decrees of Plato, and Hyppocrates) 
is the lest part of that thynge, 
of the which it is an element, and 
of these amongest the hole nature 
of thynges, there be but fower in 
number, which is the fyer, Ayer, 
water, and yearth: and as of these 
all thynges naturall, haue there 
begynnynge, so at the length, they 
shall be resolued into the same agayne. 
For Hyppocrates sayeth, 
in a boke, which he entytelleth the 
nature of man, that after the soule 
is once dissolued from the body, euery 
thinge, wherof the body was 
of first, is returned in hys owne 
nature agayne, as loke what in 
the begynnyng was drye, that is 
[^f.B6r^] 
tourned in to drye, & what was 
moyste, beco~meth moyste agayne: 
and lykewyse heat is turned into 
heat, and colde, becommeth colde 
agayne, but after these elementes 
be once mixte in the body they can 
no more be called elementes, that 
is to say pure, and simple bodyes, 
& that y~ is made of them, is a bodye 
mixt, and corruptible. 
 
Therfore as Gallen counselleth 
in the firste boke of elementes, go 
not about to serche out or to finde 
in any naturall body, any thinge 
that is simple, and not mixt, or 
compounded, leste thou lose thy 
peyne, but be contented yf thou se 
a member that is could, hard, and 
drye, and a nother that is moyste, 
rare, and fluxible, to thinke the 
tone to come of the yearth, 
[^f.B6v^] 
and the other, of the water. And 
lykewyse whan thou considerest 
with thy selfe, in thy mynde, the 
nature of a spirit, then remember 
the ayer. For seing that the elementes, 
be the lest partes of owre 
bodies, it is not possible that they 
should be perceyued by any sense. 
Yf these elementes wer not mixte 
all together, nether man, nor no other 
liuinge creature, coulde be 
made of them, for what part of the 
body they should towch, they must 
of necessitie, corrupt the same. For 
ther is no part of the bodie that 
can abyde safe without hurt, or 
dammage, the towchynge of any 
thynge, that is ether extreme hote 
or extreme colde, moyest, or drye. 
And herof it is euident that these 
elementes be not mixt in mannes 
bodye, as wheate, or barley, is 
[^f.B7r^] 
mixt in a hepe, for of the grayne 
ther is no alteratio~, seing after the 
mixture it remaynethe hole, but 
the elementes be so altered, and 
chaunged, that after the mixture, 
ther remayneth nothyng, but onely 
a signification of theire qualities, 
the which qualities, whiles 
they be in the elementes, altering 
the substaunce subiect to them, do 
cause the mutuall alteration, of y~ 
elementes. Yt is necessarie for a 
Phisition, to consider exactlye, 
and diligentlye, the nature of the 
elementes, to the ende that he may 
knowe, howe health is made of 
the temperature, of heat, cold, dry, 
and moyst, and of the distemperature 
of the same sicknes. 
 
[}The seuen chapter. 
Of temperamentes}] 
 
[^f.B7v^] 
AMongest thynges 
naturall, the temperamentes 
haue, 
the second place, a 
temperament is no 
thinge elles, but a 
complexion, or a conbination of y~ 
fower elementes, or elles of heat, 
coulde, dry and moyst: of temperamentes 
there be .ix. differencis, of 
y~ which one is temperat, because 
it excedeth in no qualitie, the rest be 
all distemperat, of the which .iiii. 
be simple, as hot, cold, dry, & moyst, 
and .iiii. be compounde, as hot & 
moyst to gether, cold and dry, hot 
and dry, coulde, and moyst. The 
ix. difference, which I sayed before 
was temperat, may be taken 
.ii. manner of wayes, ether temperat 
simple and absolutly, or elles 
temperate in euerye kynde of 
[^f.B8r^] 
thinges: loke what is temperate 
simply, and absolutly, that in the 
respect of all thinges, is temperat 
and in it the elementes be equally 
mingled, and such a thinge must 
be knowen by cogitacion only, for 
other wayes it cannot, as Gallen 
is a manifeste witnesse in the firste 
boke, that he writ in the defence of 
health. 
 
And that is temperat in euery 
kind, in the which, is the same mediocrity 
of contrary elementes, 
as is conuenient to the nature, not 
only of man and best, but also of 
trees, and plantes, and this temperament 
is in all them that be 
hole accordynge to there nature, 
and it may be knowen of hys 
functions, and officis, who is hole 
according to hys nature. 
[^f.B8v^] 
For he that can doe euerie thing 
well, which he is apt to doe naturally, 
is as hole as nature made 
hym, whether it be man or best or 
it be tree, or plant: as an apple tre 
is very well, or hole, according to 
his nature, wha~ he bereth a great 
number of good apples, and likewise 
an horse, whan he runneth 
very swift. Therfore this is not 
the temperament, which is mesured 
by weyght, wherin ther is as 
many degrees of heat, as of cold, 
and of drinesse as of moisture, for 
that is no where, nor can not be 
knowen, but by cogitation, as is aforesayd: 
but in this temperament 
which is in euery kynd of thinges 
the elementes be so mixt, that the 
temperament which commeth of 
the mixture, agreeth both to the 
nature of me~, bestes, and plantes. 
[^f.C1r^] 
Therefore it is called a temperament, 
accordynge vnto iustice, 
which mesureth to euery man, not 
by weyght, but by dignity: wherefore 
what soeruer thinge exceadeth 
this temperament, ether in heate, 
could, drynes, or moysture, y~ same 
is not temperate: and of the same 
that redoundeth it taketh y~ name, 
as if it be hete that is superfluous 
then it is called hot, & loke what 
thinge hath more hete, then colde, 
that same is hote, & contrary, yf it 
haue more cold than heate, it is 
called could, & lykewise that that 
hath more moysture, then drines, 
is named moyst: and agayne, yf 
it haue more drines the~ moysture, 
then it may be called dry: and here 
of it commeth y~ summer is called 
hote, because it hath more hete 
then coulde, and wynter is called 
[^f.C1v^] 
colde, because it hath more colde 
then heate: furthermore if a thinge 
excede in heat and moysture to gether, 
or in colde and drynesse, or in 
hete and drynesse, or in colde and 
moysture, then it must take name, 
of the qualities which excedeth: as 
yf heat and moysture excede, then 
it must be called hote and moyste: 
yf colde and drynes, cold and dry: 
and so of the other. And hereof it 
is euident, that sumtyme one temperament 
is equall and temperate 
in one opposicion, and distemperate, 
and not equall in an other. 
 
For yf it be not necessary, for that 
that is hote to be dry, but may be 
moyst, then it may also be temperate, 
because the meane is nygher 
to the dry temperature, the is y~ 
moyst: and lykewise an other temperature 
that is colde yf it may as 
[^f.C2r^] 
well be dry as moyst, may be temperate 
also: because the meane is 
nigher to the moyst temperature, 
then the dry is. 
 
The same answere may be made 
of drye and moyste, that before is 
made of hote and colde. Therefore 
it is no maruayle; though there be 
sumthinge temperate in the one 
halfe, and not temperate in the other. 
But here thou must take 
hede, yf thou be axed of what temperature 
a man, an asse, or an oxe 
is, that thou answere not symply 
and absolutly: For to that that is 
spoken diuersly, and is diuerse also 
of it selfe, no man can make absolutely 
& simply a direct answere: 
Therfore before thou make thyne 
answere, y~ must bid hym, showe y~ 
y~ ma~, the asse, or y~ oxe, whereof he 
douteth: then yf he dout of a man, 
[^f.C2v^] 
thou must haue a respect to the 
perfit man, whiche (as Gallen 
sayeth in the firste boke of his te~peramentes) 
is neyther hote, nor 
coulde, and as he differeth from 
hym, so make answere, sayinge 
eyther that he is hot, or otherwise 
as thy iudgement shall lede the: 
but yf he doubt of a best, then thou 
must haue an eye to the hole kynde 
of men. For all other kindes, compared 
vnto it, are distemperat, & 
as he differeth from mankynde, 
eyther in hete, or otherwise, so 
shape hym an answere. And that 
thou be not deceyued, in makyng 
thyne answere, thou muste vnder 
stand, that heat, coulde, dry, and 
moyst, be taken diuersly: For first 
they be taken absolutely, and simply, 
that is to say without any admixtion 
of other bodyes: and of 
[^f.C3r^] 
this sorte, the only elementes be 
hot, coulde, dry, & moyst: secondarely 
they be spoken by excesse, as 
whan there is in one thing, more 
hete then coulde, more drynesse, 
then moysture, or other wyse: and 
of this fassion bloud, fleme, wyne, 
oyle, & honny, be called hot, colde, 
dry, and moyst: and that, that is 
called hote, colde, dry, and moyste 
of this sort, is spoken yet .2. maner 
of wayes: fyrst absolutly, that is 
compared to no one alone, but to 
the hole nature of thinges, and of 
this fasshio~ a dog, simply, & absoluetly 
taken, and not compared to 
any thing alone, is dry: otherwise 
that is to say not absolutly, but 
co~pared to sum one alone, may be 
moyst, as to a pismyre. And moreouer, 
there be .iii. diuers maner of 
comparisons, the first is betwyxt 
[^f.C3v^] 
two of diuers kyndes, as a man 
to a beaste. The second is whan y~ 
distemperate is compared to the 
temperate of the same kynde, as a 
man compared to the parfit man, 
whereof we spake before. The 
thirde is, whan .ii. distemperate 
of one kynde, is compared together: 
as one man to an other, one 
lyon to an other one, one horse to an 
other. Whosoeuer dothe diligently 
examin these thinges, may easly 
iudge of what temperament the 
.iiii. tymes of the yere, that is to 
say y~ springe, summar, autumne, 
and winter, be. For eueryone 
of these by hym selfe and without 
comparison, maye be called hote 
cold, drye, or moyst, & of this fashion 
the spring is withoute all excesse, 
because there is not as is in 
wynter, more colde then heat: nor 
[^f.C4r^] 
as in summar, more heat the~ cold: 
lykewyse there is a mediocritie of 
drynesse and moysture, and therfore 
Hippocrates sayeth, that it is 
the most holsumest tyme of all the 
yere, and a tyme in the which there 
chau~seth no deadly sicknes. For y~ 
moste part of the diseases of the 
springe, happen by reson that all 
the euyll humors be driuen from 
the innar partes, in to the skynne. 
Wherefore the diseases be rather 
to be imputed to the body, then to 
y~ tyme of y~ yeare. For what body 
so euer hath good homours, that 
bodye remayneth styll in healthe, 
so long as the spryng lasteth: paraduenture 
it doeth not so in summar, 
autumne or wynter, because 
these tymes brede or encrese euyll 
humors: as summar encreaseth 
chollar, & autumne melancholy, & 
wynter fleme & watrish humors. 
[^f.C4v^] 
It is possible, that sum man wyll 
reprehend my sayinges, obiecting 
the begynnyng of the springe to 
be coulde, accordyng to wynter, & 
the latter ende hot, as in summar. 
In dede I confesse no lesse, then y~ 
begynnynge of the springe, to be a 
lytell coulde, and the latter ende, a 
lytell hote, but not in excesse, as it 
is eyther in summar, or wynter. 
Wherfore it can not be called hote 
and moyest, as su~me doe suppose, 
because it can not be hot and temperat, 
both at one tyme. As for 
summar by the consent, as well of 
the Philosophers, as of phisitions, 
is hot and dry, because there 
is in it more heat then could, more 
drinesse, then moysture. Autumne 
simply, and without exception, 
can not be called colde, and dry, 
as su~me holde opinion, for it is not 
[^f.C5r^] 
coulde, because there is as muche 
heate as coulde, seing the middle 
of the day is much hotter, then 
the mornynge, and euenynge. 
Therefore it is founde to be distemperat, 
in heat, and coulde, and 
so mixt of bothe, that it can nether 
be called hote, nether coulde. 
Therefore it is full of perilouse 
diseases because it is distempered 
both in heate, and coulde: and because 
it hath more drynesse, then 
moysture, therefore it is called 
dry. As for wynter it is moyst, & 
could not because it is more moyst 
& coulde, then y~ other times of the 
yere, but because there is more 
moysture then drines, more could 
then heate. Nowe that I haue so 
brefelye (as I coulde) declared 
the temperamentes of the tymes 
of the yere, it is mete & co~uenient, 
[^f.C5v^] 
to shewe in as fewe wordes as 
I can, the temperamentes of the 
.iiii.ages, which are chyldehode, 
youth, mannes state, and olde age. 
Chyldehode is from the chyldyng 
the space of .xv. yere next folowyng, 
and it is hote and moyst, and 
that is easie to be perceyued hereof, 
that the first constitution of the 
chylde, is of feede, and bloude, the 
whiche both be hote and moyst. 
Youthe beginneth where chyldehod 
endeth, & continueth .x. yeres: 
in this age ther is more firye heat, 
& lesse natural heat the~ is in childehode 
as Gallen witnesseth in hys 
second boke of temperamentes. 
Mannes state begynneth at .xxv. 
and continueth to .xxxv. the which 
tyme is hote and dry: Olde age 
beginneth at .xxxv. and continueth 
the rest of the lyfe, though summe 
[^f.C6r^] 
doe recken it but to .ix. and fortie 
yere, and it is colde & dry. Ye shall 
fynde in other places, mo differences 
of ages, howbeit I thinke 
these sufficient, for suche as be 
not to deynty, and exquisite. 
Whoso thinketh hym selfe not satisfyed, 
with this brefe exposition 
of temperamentes, let hym reade 
diligently Galenes .iii. bokes of 
temperamentes, and I dout not, 
but he shall be satisfyed. For I 
makyng haste to better and more 
profitable knowledge, ca~not finde 
in my harte, to tary any lenger in 
this disputation, yet whoso euer 
shall dilygently examine in hys 
mynde that that is wrytte~ before, 
may easely (yf he be not halfe folishe) 
gather y~ rest which wanteth 
without a techer, or an instructar. 
 
[}The .viii. chapter of humors.}] 
 
[^f.C6v^] 
HUmours be fower in 
number, that is to 
say, bloude, chollar, 
flewme, and melancholy: 
of the which, 
bloude is hote, moyst, and swete. 
Flewme is coulde, moyst, and vnsauery, 
lyke vnto the pure water: 
yelowe chollar, hote, dry, and bittar: 
blacke chollar, or melancholy, 
coulde, drye, sowre, and stipticke. 
 
These humours be called hot, 
could, dry, and moyst, because they 
be so in power, and not in acte, and 
ther is great difference betwixte 
thinges that be hot of power: and 
thinges hot in acte. For that thing 
is hot in acte, which is hot alredy, 
and that is hot in power, which is 
not hot alredy, but may, and is apt 
to be hot afterward, & so we call 
bryne, or vinegar drye, though 
[^f.C7r^] 
they appere to the eye to be moyst, 
yet experience hath proued them 
drye, because they consume the 
superfluous humours, bothe of 
flesh, & also other thinges. Whan 
these .iiii. humours reserue theyr 
forsayde qualities, then the body 
wherein they be, is hole, and with 
out disease, and the before named 
humours, be called of the Phisitions, 
naturall. The receptacles of 
bloud, be the vaynes, and pulses, 
but the bloud, that is contayned 
in the pulses, (as Gallen sayeth 
in his first boke, and first chapter 
of affected places) differeth from 
the blowde of the vaynes, in that, 
that the blowde of the pulses is 
both hotter, thynnar, & yelower. 
The well of the blowde, is the liuer, 
& not onely that, but also the 
first instrument of mannes bodye, 
[^f.C7v^] 
and the naturall and true cullour 
of the blowd, is red: which Galen 
affirmeth in many places. Where 
blowde redoundeth the body is 
fear, fayer, mery, & plesantly disposed. 
Flewme, of cullour is white, 
which at the length by y~ meanes 
of naturall heat, may be tourned 
in to bloude: and therefore seinge 
it is a nowrishment but halfe boyled, 
nature hath prouided no propre, 
or peculier receptacle for the 
pourgynge of it. For flewme engendred 
in the stomake or mawe, 
be cause it is carryed together w~ 
the iuice that came of the meate & 
drinke vp in to y~ liuer, is at length 
by much alteration tourned into 
bloude, and that which is caryed 
together with the bloud in the 
vaynes, may skant be spared, because 
it mittigateth the greate 
feruent, and outragious heat of 
[^f.C8r^] 
y~ bloud: therfore it hath more nede 
to tarry styll & be altered, then to 
be pourged, & caryed away, but y~ 
that remayneth behynde in the 
guttes, is pourged, & caryed quite 
oute at the fundament, by reason of 
the chollar cumynge fro the lyuer 
(as Gallen sayeth in the .v. of his 
bokes, of the vse of the partes of 
mannes body.) The excrement 
which falleth fro~ y~ brayne in to y~ 
mouth, can not properly be called 
flewme but rather muck, or sniuil: 
flewmatick bodyes be slothfull, 
slepy, fleshye, & soone horeheared. 
Yelowe chollar hath his name, of 
his culour, & nature hathe prouided 
a proper place for it, which is 
y~ blather vnder y~ liuer: for it was 
necessary for it to be parted from 
the bloud, lest at the length y~ hole 
body, should becumne yelowe, as 
it doth in the yelowe Iawndies. 
[^f.C8v^] 
Cholericke men be angry, sharpe 
wytted, nymble, and quicke in all 
theyr affayers, inconstant, and 
leane and good digesters of theyr 
meat: melancholy is the dregges 
and filthe of the bloud, and therefore 
it is blacke, as it appereth in 
the name: it were great daunger, 
for it to be left in the liuer, therfore 
the splyne is prouided of nature, 
to receyue it, the which splyne yf it 
drawe lesse then it should do, then 
the melancholy, or blacke chollar, 
is left with the blowde: by reason 
whereof the body getteth a 
black colour, or at the least a feuer 
quartayne. Men that be melancholy, 
be sottell, couetouse, greate 
frettars with them selues, vnfaythfull, 
sad, and carefull, enuious 
ferfull, and weak sprited. The vse 
of these forsayde humors, is such 
[^f.D1r^] 
in especiall as foloweth. The 
bloud serueth to the nowrishment 
of the hole body, flewme helpeth 
the mouyng of the ioyntes, yelow 
chollar clenseth the intestines of 
of their flewme and filthe, melancholy 
healpeth y~ action of the stomake, 
(as Gallene writeth in his 
v. boke of the vse of the partes, of 
mannes body) by reason y~ it draweth 
the stomake together, wherby 
the naturall heat, is encreased: 
& the concoction of the meat, made 
much the more parfit. Soranus 
an Ephesian borne, wryteth: that 
these humours rule the body by 
course, eche of them .vi. houres to 
gether: as bloud begynneth at .ix. 
of the clocke in the night, & ruleth 
vntyll .iii. of the mornyng, yelowe 
chollar beginneth at .3. in the mornyng, 
and gouerneth vntyll .ix. of 
[^f.D1v^] 
the mornyng, melancholy beginneth 
at .ix. and continueth to .iii. in 
the after noone. Flewme begynneth 
at .iii. of the after noone, and 
lasteth tyll .ix. of the night. These 
humors, sumtyme lose theyre naturall 
qualities wherby they hurt 
the body, and be called not naturall. 
Blowde becummeth vnnaturall, 
ether whan it putrifieth in the 
vaynes, be cause the pores be shut, 
or els whan it is mixt with su~me 
other euyll humor, as in the dropsy, 
where it is mingled w~ water, 
or finally, whan it is mixt, ether w~ 
ouer muche chollar, flewme, or 
melancholy, whereof it taketh a 
newe name, and is called eyther 
cholericke blowd, flewmaticke, or 
melancholy bloud: For it is neuer 
naturall, except in the mixture, it 
haue the rule and dominion. Of 
vnnaturall flewme, there be .iiii. 
[^f.D2r^] 
kyndes, (as Gallen wytnessyth in 
his second boke & .vi. chapter, of y~ 
differences of feuers). The first is 
watrysh, & of the cullar of molten 
glasse, wherof it hathe to name 
citrine & is very cowld. The second 
kynde, is that which after y~ 
hawking out, hath a swete taste, & 
is called swete flewme. The third 
is sowre of taste, & is not so colde 
as the citrine, & cowlder then the 
swete. The fowerth is salt, eyther 
by y~ mixture of su~me salt humor, 
or elles by putrifactio~, & is called 
salt flewme. Of vnnaturall yealowe 
chollar, there be .v. kyndes. 
The firste is yelowe, lyke vnto the 
yolkes of egges, & as Gallen sayeth 
is engendred in y~ vaynes The 
second is colowred lyke leade, or 
garlicke & is bred in y~ stomake or 
mawe. The thirde is of a rusty cullour, 
& it also is bred in y~ stomake. 
[^f.D2v^] 
The forth inclineth sumwhat towardes 
grene, and is engendred 
in the place beforesayd. The .v. is 
of the cullour of the sea, and groweth 
in the stomacke also. Of mela~choly, 
or black chollar, ther is but 
one kynde vnnaturall, & it is sumwhat 
browne of cullour, and so 
sharpe and sowre that it eateth, & 
fretteth the body, where it goethe. 
 
[}The .ix. chapter, of the partes 
of mannes body.}] 
 
THe firste diuision of 
partes of ma~nes body, 
is of those, that y~ 
latten men call similares, 
& dissimilares, 
whiche in englishe, may be called 
lyke, and vnlike. For similares be 
such partes as be lyke vnto them 
selues in all thinges, which when 
they be diuided, or parted in sonder 
[^f.D3r^] 
the leste of them kepeth the same 
name that the hole dothe, whereof 
it is part: and dissimilares, be such 
as are vnlyke them selfes in all 
thinges, which whan they be deuided 
or parted a sunder, none of 
them can be called by the name y~ 
the hole is, as in example. No part 
of the head, can (yf it be separat, & 
parted, from the head) be called an 
head: no more can any part of the 
hand be named an hand, nor of y~ 
foote, a foote: nor of the eye, an eye: 
yet euery parte of water is called 
water, and euery part of bloud, is 
called bloude, and euerye parte of 
bone, bone: and euery part of flesh, 
is called fleshe. Therfore these last 
rehersed be such as the laten men 
call similares, and the other be the 
selfe same, y~ be called dissimilares, 
or instrumentales. Gallen sayeth, y~ 
[^f.D3v^] 
the same partes, which the latyns 
call similares, be the first elementes, 
and begynners of mannes bodye, 
although the selfe same, be common 
to brute beastes also, for ther 
is nether oxe, horse, ne dogge, 
but they haue pulses, vaynes, senewes, 
tiinges, gristilles, skinnes, 
and fleshe, yet not in all poyntes 
lyke vnto man, and beside these, other 
that man hath not, as hornes, 
bylles, spowres, & skales: of these, 
the other which be called dissimilares, 
or instrumentales, be made, as 
hed, handes, feet, & such lyke. An 
instrumentall parte, differith from 
the instrument, because that su~me 
of the same partes, before is called 
similares, be instrumentes, and yet 
may not be instrumentall partes. 
For euery part (as gallen sayeth) 
that bringeth forth a parfit actio~ 
[^f.D4r^] 
is an instrument: wherof it commeth 
that the pulses, vaynes, and 
senewes, be instrumentes, and no 
instrumentall partes. Of y~ instrumentall 
partes, there be thre called 
chefe, or principall: y~ brayne, hart, 
& liuer. There are summe, whiche 
addeth vnto these, y~ priuy partes, 
because they conserue and kepe y~ 
kinde. 
 
There be belonging to these, 
.iiii. other, as to y~ brayne, senewes: 
to the hart, pulses: to the liuer, 
vaynes: and to the pryuye partes, 
the sparmaticke vessayles: besyde 
these, there be certayne other 
partes of the body, whiche nether 
rule other, nor yet be ruled of other, 
but hath a facultie of them 
selfes, wherof they be gouerned: 
as bone, tiynge, skynne and fleshe. 
[^f.D4v^] 
All y~ partes of mannes body, haue 
nede of pulses, and vaynes, to the 
keping of ther substance: vaynes, 
to the entent y~ they may be nowrished, 
and pulses for the kepynge 
of naturall heat in good temper. 
Hytherto I haue spoken generally 
of the partes of mannes body: 
whoso is wyllyng to haue a particular 
rehersall of all the partes, 
let them seke Gallen, or Uesalfus. 
For they haue writte~ hole bokes, 
and greate volumes of them: and 
as for me, I haue written of the 
same, in an other place, so well as 
my wyt, lernyng, knowledge, and 
the sterilitie and baraynes of the 
english tong, wolde gyue me leue. 
Therfore if that I should wryte 
the same agayne, I shoulde both 
be ouer tedious to such as showld 
heare me, & also I showld breake 
[^f.D5r^] 
my promyse, because I haue promised, 
to write a brefe, and a shorte 
treatyse, vpon Phisicke. 
 
[}The .x. chapter, of powers 
or faculties.}] 
 
A Facultie, or a power, 
is the cause, fro~ 
whence the action 
procedethe. There 
be .iii. faculties, or 
powers, diuers ech 
to other, which gouerneth the bodye, 
and be called Animall, vitall, 
and naturall. The animall power 
or facultie, cummeth from the 
brayne by the senewes, geueth 
both mouyng and felynge, to eche 
part of the body, and is author of 
the senses, and all voluntary actions. 
The vital power cummeth 
from the harte, and is caryed in 
the pulse throughout the bodye, 
[^f.D5v^] 
wherto it geueth life: wherof it is 
euident, that the hart is the wel of 
lifely heat: the natural power co~meth 
from the liuer, and is caried 
to euerye parte of the body, by the 
vaynes, and serueth to the norishynge 
of the same. This power, or 
facultie, is deuided in .iiii. other 
powers, the first is attractiue, the 
second is retentiue, the third concoctiue 
or alteratiue, the fowerth 
expulsiue. The attractiue power, 
is the same, by y~ which, euery part 
of y~ body draweth to it, such iuyce 
as is mete and conuenient to norishe 
it, and that iuyce, which is 
sooneste made like, is most conuenient 
for nowrishment: therfore 
this power, seing that it prepareth 
matter, to the norishment of euery 
part, serueth to the power alteratiue, 
or concoctiue. The retentyue 
[^f.D6r^] 
power holdeth y~ same which is alredy 
drawen, vntyl it be altered & 
chaunged: & this power also, serueth 
vnto the alteratiue, or concoctiue 
power. 
The alteratiue power, hath name 
of hys action, for it altereth the 
iuyce, and at the length, maketh it 
lyke to the part, that is norished. 
The expulsiue power or facultie, 
separateth the euyll from y~ good, 
lest with long tariynge together, 
the one shoulde marre the other: & 
this as the other, serueth to the alteratiue 
power. These .4. powers, 
be in euery part of euery naturall 
body, as Gallen witnesseth, 
in hys bokes, of powers 
or faculties. 
 
[}The .xi. chapter, 
of Actions.}] 
 
[^f.D6v^] 
AN action, is an actuall 
mouyng, procedinge 
from a facultie, 
and therefore 
the facultie is alwayes 
the cause of the action, 
wherfore whan the power perisheth, 
ther foloweth no action at all: 
That which the action hath made 
& finished, is the worke: as bloud, 
fleshe, & bone, and as ye may call 
euery action a certayne worke of 
Nature, so ye can not call euery 
worke, an actio~: as flesh is a work 
of nature, & not an action. There 
is in y~ body .ii. manner of actions. 
One is called Anymall, or voluntarie, 
which procedeth from the 
synowes, and muscules, & this is 
suche an actio~, y~ whan it is, it may 
be seased, & whan it is not, it may 
[^f.D7r^] 
be raysed, as a man lifteth, as in 
example. The head, armes, and 
legges, may be moued, or holden 
styll, as it shall plese the body, that 
hath them. This action is parted 
in to thre. The first is of feelynge, 
which is deuided in .v. as in to the 
action of seinge, hearinge, felinge, 
smellynge, and tastyng. The seco~d, 
is the action of voluntarye mouyng. 
The third, is the action, of 
the cogitation, memory, and reason, 
which of all the rest, is most 
noble, and excellent. As for respiration, 
is a voluntary action, because 
it is in oure wyll to holde 
oure breth: or to let it go, which is 
euident of the seruaunt (that Galle~ 
speketh of) which held his breth 
vntyl he dyed. Wherfore it is euident, 
that su~me voluntarye actions, 
be free: & sum, serue the affectio~s 
[^f.D7v^] 
of the body. For to walke any 
whither, or to speake with any body, 
or to take any thinge, be fre actions, 
but to ease the belly or to 
make water, serue the necessitie of 
the bodye. Yt is possible for a ma~ 
to holde hys peace (yf he haue so 
constitute with hym selfe) an hole 
yeare to gether, but to hold his excrement, 
or hys water .ii. monethes, 
or .ii. weekes, it is not possible. 
For they prouoke so oft, and 
greue a man so muche, that oftentymes, 
they wyll not abyde, tyll 
they maye be conuenientlye let 
forth, and lyke vnto these, is respiration, 
or the actio~, of brething. 
For whosoeuer hathe his brethe 
stopped, but a very littell tyme, it 
is a greate doubte, yf he dye not 
fourth with all. But the naturall 
action, which is not voluntarye, 
[^f.D8r^] 
cummeth of the vaynes, and pulses. 
For let a man doe what he 
shall, and yet they wyll doe theire 
office, without any let. Amongest 
the naturall actions, be reckened, 
generation, Auction, nutrition, 
Formation, Alteration, appeticion, 
attraction, concoction, retention. 
distribution, excretion, & such 
other. But as for generation, it is 
not one simple naturall action, for 
in it is, bothe alteration, and formation. 
The amplyfycation, and 
increacement, in length, bredeth 
and depenesse, of all the vttar 
partes of the bodye, is called auction. 
Nutrition, is the assimilation, 
or makyng lyke, of the nurishment 
to that, that is nurished: to 
the whiche, apposition, and agglutination 
or adhesio~ be necessary. 
For after that the iuyce, which 
[^f.D8v^] 
afterward shall nurish euery part 
of the body, is once fallen from y~ 
vaynes, it must first be put to, and 
then ioyned or glued, & last of all, 
made like. It is very mete and expedient 
for euery Phisition, entending 
his pacientes health, diligently 
to consider all the actions, 
as well the animall, as naturall: 
because of them, the constitution 
of the body, is easy to be knowen. 
 
For what body so euer is in 
health, the same hath all the actions 
parfit and sownde, and what 
body is sicke and diseased, it hath 
cleane otherwise. Moreouer the 
action for the most part, declareth 
the place affected. For there can be 
no action hurt, but that part or instrument, 
wherin it is, must be affected 
also. 
 
[}The .xii. chapter, of spirites.}] 
 
[^f.E1r^] 
A Spirit is a subtyl, 
thynne, and bright 
substance, made of 
the finest partes of 
the blowd, that the 
power may be caried 
from the principall partes of y~ 
body, to y~ rest: wherby eche maye 
doe hys dutie and office. There be 
in number, only .iii. spirites: the animall, 
vitall, and naturall. The 
animall spirit, hath his place in y~ 
brayne, and being dispersed in the 
senewes, geueth the power of 
mouinge, and feling, to eche part 
of the body: It is made of the vitall 
spirite. The vitall spirit, is in 
the hart, and is caried in the arteries, 
throughout the body, being 
the very cause of all naturall, and 
lyuely heat: It is made of the exhalations, 
or the dryest, and finest 
[^f.E1v^] 
partes of the bloud. Yf there 
be any naturall spirit, it is in the 
liuer and vaynes, and in dede to 
say the truthe, there is no greate 
nede for any spirite, to carry any 
power of nowrishing through the 
body, seing y~ euery part draweth 
hys nurishment, euen as the adamante 
stone draweth yron: & besyde 
this, the liuer hath no such 
matter, as any spirit can be made 
of. For if there were any 
matter, wherof the naturall spirit 
might be made, that muste nedes 
be the vitall spirit, of whome the 
animall spirite also, is made: but 
seing that the vitall spirit is enge~dred 
in the hart, and by the pulses 
carryed through the body, it had 
ben necessary, that there shold haue 
ben great pulses, from the hart to 
to the lyuer, whiche might haue 
[^f.E2r^] 
broughte so much vitall spirit, as 
shoulde haue suffised to haue made 
naturall spirite. Howbeit it is euident, 
y~ there cummeth no arteries 
to the lyuer, but such as be 
with the smallest for such a pourpose, 
and then ther is no such cauitie 
in the liuer, as is in the brayne, 
or hart, where any generation of 
the naturall spirit, may be. Moreouer, 
there is no vesselles prepared 
of nature for the cariage of it, excepte 
a man shoulde say, that it is 
caryed with the grosse bloude in y~ 
vaynes, whych is not lyke: seinge 
the vaynes, haue but one cote, and 
that of no great thickenes, nether 
(& yf that were true,) the vaynes 
shoulde bear, as y~ arteries doe. Also 
there is no waye or enterance 
for ayer, wherof it might be nowrished 
as the animall & vitall be. 
[^f.E2v^] 
And agayne, the bloud of the 
lyuer, is so grosse, and mixt with other 
humors, that it is not mete to 
make any spirites of. Therfore, seinge 
that there is nether any ende, 
wherfore it showlde be made, nor 
matter, wherof it could be made, 
nor nourishment to preserue it, nor 
a conuenient place, to make it in, 
nor finally any way or conduite, 
wherby it might be brought in 
to euery part of the bodye: I 
may iustly, and not without 
a cause, doubt of it, 
although it be a common 
opinion amongest 
y~ phistions, 
that 
there 
is a naturall spirite.

[^f.E3r^] 
[}The seconde 
boke. 
The .i. chapter, Of the 
number of thinges 
not naturall.}] 
 
THinges not natural, 
be .vi. in number. 
1 Ayer. 
2 Meat and drinke, 
or any thing, i~wardlye 
taken. 
3 Exercise, and reste, both of the 
body, and partes. 
4 Slepe and watche. 
5 Excretion, and retention, or 
fulnes, and emptines. 
6 Affectes or perturbations of 
the mynde. 
These be called thinges not naturall, 
because they alter oure bodies, 
[^f.E3v^] 
and if they be not discretly taken, 
vtterlye abolish health: on the 
other parte, yf they be wisely and 
soberly vsed: they doe not only defende 
health, but also strengthen 
nature in all her workes and actions. 
Therfore they be in y~ parte 
of phisicke, which defe~deth health 
And to the ende that no man, be 
ignorant in y~ vse of them, I pourposse 
brefely, & in as fewe wordes 
as I ca~, to declare & shew the vses 
of eche of them alone by himselfe. 
 
[}The .ii. chapter, 
of Ayer.}] 
 
OF thinges not natural. 
Ayer is most necessarye 
to be considered, 
because y~ naturall 
heat, can not 
[^f.E4r^] 
be kept in temper, without it, and 
because, we muste nedes receyue it 
into our bodies, be the weather neuer 
so foule, and finallye there can 
neyther health be defended, nor 
disease cured, or remedied without 
it. Therfore it lyeth vs in 
hand, to take especiall heed, and 
diligent watche, that we minister 
it in due tyme and season, that it 
may be as it shoulde be, a cause of 
health, which no doubte it shall, if 
first we marke wel the substaunce 
of it, whether it be pure and clene, 
or grosse and thicke, or cloudie. 
That is y~ best and most holsume, 
which is purest, not infected with 
no standinge pooles, nor no marrishe 
groundes, nor with the carren 
of bestes, nor with the putryfactio~ 
of herbes, fruite, or grayne, 
and such lyke. 
[^f.E4v^] 
Whan we haue well considered 
the substance of the ayer, then we 
must marke well the qualitie. For 
as to temperat bodies, the moste 
temperat ayer is holsumest, so to 
bodies distempered, ayer distempered 
in a co~trary qualitie, is most 
holsum: as to suche as be cowlde: 
ayer that is hote, and to suche as 
be hote, cowlde: and to them that 
be dry, moyste: and to suche as be 
moyste, dry. But yf it happen so, y~ 
the ayer be not contrary of qualitie, 
then it must be prepared and 
made for oure pourpose by art: as 
yf the disease or sicknes be hote & 
dry, then we must by sprinklynge 
of cowlde water on the pauement 
or floore, & by strawyng of herbes 
& be settyng vp of suche boughes 
as be colde & moyst, prepare y~ ayer 
& make it coulde, & moyst: On y~ 
[^f.E5r^] 
othersyde, yf the disease be cowlde 
and moyst, then the house must be 
perfumed with such thinges as be 
hote and dry, vntyll the ayer also 
be made hote, and dry. In long 
diseases, ther is none so good a remedy, 
as to change the ayer: and 
therof it came, that so many going 
to saynte Cornelis, were healed & 
cured of the falling euyl: by changyng 
of the ayer, and not by myracle, 
as we poore fooles thought, 
kneling, & creping, to saynt Cornelis 
horne: but thankes be to the 
omnipotent, and euer lyuing god, 
and to oure noble kynge, such most 
vyle abhominable ydolatry, 
is nowe well lefte here 
in this realme. 
 
[}On~ meate and drinke. 
The .iii. chapter}] 
 
[^f.E5v^] 
I Woulde counsel euery 
man, as well 
the hole as y~ sicke, 
to take good hede 
what they eat and 
drinke: For bothe 
the goodnes, mesure, qualitie, custome, 
delectation, order, tyme, 
houre, and age, must be considered. 
Therfore he that purposeth 
not to be sicke, nor to haue a sickly 
body, let his firste care be to eat 
suche meates, as make good iuice. 
 
For there is nothyng so apt to 
breede sicknes, as is the euyl habit 
of y~ body, which is gotten by 
feadyng of meates, that make euyll 
and noughtye iuyce. That is 
alwayes good meate, which is 
light in digestyng, and thynne of 
substaunce, and the which also 
bredeth good iuyce: and that is euill, 
which is contrary vnto it. His 
[^f.E6r^] 
next care ought to be, that he eate 
no more at one tyme, then is sufficient 
to serue Nature, & so he shall 
bryng to passe, that eyther he shall 
neuer or elles very seldome, fall 
in to any perilous disease: Howbeit 
y~ Phisition shoulde geue great 
dilige~ce, in dieting of the sicke. For 
a litell to much sumtyme, though 
the meat be neuer so good, maketh 
a fault incorrigible: & a quicke or 
sharpe sicknesse, & a sicknes that is 
long & slow, may not be measured 
bothe a like. For a sharpe, & a short 
disease, must haue a thinne, and a 
slendar diet: and a longe disease, a 
more fullar. Therfore the Phisicio~ 
in prescribing of diet, must marke 
well the strength of hys pacient: & 
first according vnto hys strength, 
& then according to the nature of 
the sicknes, prescribe y~ measure of 
hys meates and drinkes. 
[^f.E6v^] 
After the measure the Phisition 
ought immediatly to marke well 
the qualitie of the meates: For 
such as be hole, to the ende that 
they may kepe theyr health, muste 
be fed with meates of lyke, & not 
of contrary qualitie: and suche as 
be sicke, ought to be fed w~ meates 
of contrary qualitie: As they that 
be sycke for hete, must be remedied 
by meates that be coulde, & they 
that be sicke of colde diseases, must 
haue hote meates: and in diseases 
that be moyste, dry meates: and in 
dry diseases, moyst meates. Therfore 
suche as haue moyst bodies, 
as childre~, must be fed with moyst 
meates: and such as be sicke of dry 
diseases, as of feuers, must also 
be fed w~ moyst meates, the tone 
to kepe theyr bodyes moyst styll, & 
the other, to amende and correcte 
[^f.E7r^] 
their drynesse: and lykewise of the 
rest. Such as be hote of nature, 
must eat hot meates, y~ they may 
kepe theyr heat styll, byt yf theyr 
heat once waxe vnnaturall, then 
it must be brought in temper, by y~ 
healp of such thinges, as are colde: 
and yf they be ouer colde, by heat: 
and yf they be ouer moyst, by dryeth: 
but if theyr heat, colde, drinesse 
or moysture be naturall, & excede 
not, then it must be cherished styll 
with meates of like qualities, as I 
said before. Next the qualitie consider 
the custume, for that ought 
not to be broken, except there be 
great cause whye, seing that such 
meates as a man hath accustomed 
hym selfe vnto, although they be 
worse, hurt not so much as the other 
doe, of the which he hath not 
accustomed to eat of. Therfore in 
[^f.E7v^] 
diseases, the Phisition may not be 
to busie, in pluckyng away their 
pacientes from theyr accustomed 
meates & drinkes: but if it happen 
so, that of necessitie there must be 
a change, then it may not be done 
rashely, or all at ones, but fayre & 
softly, and by lyttell, & lytell. For 
all sudden mutations, be daungerous. 
And it is mete for the Phisition 
to obserue, in what meates y~ 
sicke deliteth most. For suche as he 
hath pleasure of in the eatinge, 
the same the stomake enbraseth 
more gredely: and digesteth or altereth 
much soner, & therfore they 
must be taken, & preferred before 
better, though they be worse. Furthermore 
he must take heed what 
order his pacient kepe in hys diet, 
for it is a preposterous ordar, to 
beginne with quynces or orynges 
[^f.E8r^] 
and ende with sallades, made of 
herbes, and oyle. 
Take this alwayes as a generall 
rule, that that meat which is most 
easy to be digested, shoulde be eaten 
before that, that is hardar: & 
that also that is moyst, before that 
that is drie: and that that is leuse 
and slipperie, before that y~ is hard 
and byndinge. Amongest other 
thinges, the time of eatyng wolde 
not be forgotten. 
They that be hole, shoulde exercise 
the~ selfes before they eat, & should 
not eat against theyr appetite, nor 
abstayne whan ther appetite prouoketh 
them: & they that be sicke, 
shoulde vtterlye forbeare, vntyll 
there fittes were in the declination, 
or ful finished. 
Howbeit the disease may be suche, 
[^f.E8v^] 
& the pacientes strength so weake, 
y~ it shall be nedefull to fede them, 
both in their fittes, & out of theyr 
fittes: howbeit I leaue that to the 
discretion of the Phisition. And I 
thinke it but well doone, to put 
you in remembraunce, what your 
diet should be, in the .iiii. seuerall 
times of the yere: In winter, more 
meat and lesse drinke, and meates 
and drinkes that be hot and drye, 
as rosted meates, and wyne then 
may safely be dronken, withoute 
water. In the spring, we shoulde 
eat sumdele lesse, and drinke a lytell 
more then in wynter, and eate 
also more of fleshe, and change fro~ 
rosted to boyled: In summar we 
must endeuer oure selfes, y~ oure 
bodies may be soft, and colde, and 
therfore we must eat lesse, & drinke 
the more, and eat for the most part 
[^f.F1r^] 
boyled meates, & such as is colde. 
In Autumne we should eat sumthynge 
more then in summer, and 
drinke lesse, and of byggar drinkes 
be sumthinge more bolder then in 
summer. And as the tyme is to be 
considered, so is the age also. For 
chyldren must be fed, with moyst 
meates. And such as be not yet at 
their groeth, because their bodies 
be more temperate, muste haue, 
more temperate meates. And 
lusty men such as is alredye paste 
theyr groeth, because their bodies 
be hot, and dry, shoulde haue lyke 
meates, that is to say suche as is 
hot & dry: olde men because their 
bodies be ouer cold and dry, must 
be fed with meates, that be hote 
and moyste. 
 
[}The .iiii. chapter, Of 
exercise, and rest.}] 
 
[^f.F1v^] 
EUery softe mouynge, 
is not an 
exercise, as Gallen 
sayeth, but y~ 
that is su~thing 
vehement, as lepyng, 
coytyng, 
runnyng, tennys, footbale, shootyng, 
and such lyke. Exercise hath 
many notable commodities but .3. 
in especiall: the hardnes of the instrumentes, 
the encrese of naturall 
heat, and the more vehement and 
quicker mouynge of the spirites: & 
eche of these hath hys peculier, and 
particuler co~moditie. The instrumentes 
by meanes of theire hardnes, 
may endure to labor the bettar, 
and also perfourme theyre actio~ 
more easely. The encrese of naturall 
heat amendeth the alteration, 
and concoction of the meat, 
[^f.F2r^] 
wherby the body is much y~ more 
luckely nurished. The quicker & 
vehementer mouynge of the spirites, 
healpeth to pourge the excrementes, 
bothe by the raynes, 
skinne, & guttes. Exercise bringeth 
these co~modities to y~ bodye, yf it 
be take~ in due tyme, or elles it hurteth 
more then it profitteth; for yf 
it be taken whan ther is ether any 
cruditie in y~ stomake, or vaynes, it 
will fill all y~ body full of euyll humors, 
by reason that y~ crude, and 
rawe iuyse, is plucked in to eche 
part of the bodye. Wherfore exercise, 
shoulde ether be taken before 
meat, or elles after that y~ concoction 
of y~ stomake & liuer is ended: 
& y~ parfit knowlege of this tyme, 
is taken of y~ vryne. For whan the 
concoction of the liuer is donne, 
then the vryne waxeth yelowe. 
[^f.F2v^] 
Howbeit the very best tyme of exercise 
is whan yester dayes meat 
is throughly digested: as one time 
for exercise, is better the~ an other, 
so one kynde of exercise, profiteth 
y~ body more then an other. That 
is y~ beste kynde of exercise, in the 
which euery part of the body, susteyneth 
lyke labor and payne, and 
yet in the same there may be committed 
many errors and faultes: 
for it may be to much, or to littell, 
yet of bothe, lesse hurteth to lyttle. 
Therfore the exercise, wolde continue 
so longe, vntyll the bodye 
swellethe, and waxinge read, beginne 
to swete all ouer: and whan 
any of these tokens chanceth, then 
the exercise wolde be seased incontinent, 
lest the good iuice be expelled 
together with the euyll, & so 
the body shal be made leaner, and 
[^f.F3r^] 
dryer, which wyll hynder the groinge. 
As exercise, yf it be discretely 
mynistred, preuayleth much to the 
defence of health, so rest and quietnes, 
yf it be not taken in his tyme, 
filleth y~ body full of sicknes: For 
it causeth cruditie, which is y~ mother, 
and roote in manner, of all 
dau~gerous sicknes. There be many 
good tymes for rest, but the very 
best tyme, as Hyppocrates witnessith, 
is wha~ the body is weried 
with labor, and exercise. For then 
he sayeth, that y~ rest taketh awaye 
the werinesse.
