[}OBSERV. I.}] 
 
THE Countess of Northampton, aged 44. 
on March the 6th, 1622. as she was 
walking in her Bed-chamber, suddenly 
fell into a swoon, without either 
sense or motion for half an hour, she fell with 
her face on the frame of a Table, which caused a 
Wound with contusion, whence arose Inflammation, 
as also a great and troublesom Flux of Rheum, 
which distilling from her eyes, excoriated the 
whole face with exulcerations; the habit of her 
Body was Scorbutick and Cacochymick: her residence 
then was at Ludlow-Castle: To whom being 
called, I cured perfectly, by God's assistance, with 
[^p.2^] 
the following Medicines. She was purged with 
the following, +R Sena +o j. Agarick +Q iij. Rubarb 
+Q ii. Cinnamon +o i +s. Infuse them all for twelve hours 
in three pints of White-wine on warm embers, after it 
was strained through an Ippocras bag, six or seven times, 
and sweetned with half a pound of Sugar. Dose +o v. 
twice a day, viz. in the morning fasting, and at 
four a clock in the afternoon. This gave five or 
six stools a day without gripings, it was continued 
four days. Her face was anointed with white 
Ointment camphorated, which cured it in four days. 
The Body being not sufficiently emptied, the following 
Pills were used, +R Pil. Ruffin. & Succin. 
Crato. of each equal parts; of +Q i, were made seven 
Pills, three of which she took when she went to 
bed, the next day she had six or seven stools. But 
this was observable, that instead of swallowing the 
Pills, she chewed them, and so let them down, 
saying she could not swallow them, though never 
so little; withal, that she thought it the best way. 
She took of these twice a week. Those days she 
took not the Pills, I administred the following: 
+R Elect. Chalyb, Crat. mixed with the salts of Scurvy-grass, 
Wormwood and Coral. In her Broth was 
boiled these Scorbutick Herbs, viz. Scurvy-grass, 
Water-Cresses, and Brook-lime. After all, she took 
this Scorbutick Beer, +R Scurvy-grass M iv. Water-Cresses, 
Brook-lime, each M ii. Wormwood, Fumitory, 
and Germander, each M. j. Roots of Fennel, Borage, 
Succory, each +o i. Root of Elicampany +o +s. Liquoris 
+o i. Flowers of Borag. Buglosse, Rosemary, each p ii. 
Boyl them all in five gallons of Beer, till one be wasted. 
After having the following Ingredients in a bag, viz. 
Sarsaparilla, Calamus aromaticus, Cinnamon, Mace, 
[^p.3^] 
Seeds of Anis and Fennel, each +o +s. Juniper-berries 
+o viii. Let them be infused in the hot liquor, well covered 
till it be cold, after put it up, hanging the bag in 
it. After fifteen days she drank of it, using no 
other; this she drank in April. Till it was ready, she 
took the following; +R Sarsaparila +o ii. Guaicum 
+o i. Sassafras roots +Q ii. Slice aud bruise them, after infuse 
them in +L xv. of Spring-water for twelve hours. 
After add Scurvy-grass M ij. Brook-lime, Water-cresses, 
each M i. Betony, Agrimony, each M +s. Currants 
+o ii. Boyl them all till v +L be wasted; after take 
it from the fire, adding presently of Cinnamon bruised 
+Q i. after let it pass through an Hippocras bag. Dose 
+o vi. taken hot, being in bed, composing the Body 
to sweat gently; cover the Head and Neck with 
hot linnen clothes: after sweating, the sweat was 
rubbed of gently with fine dry warm linnen. An 
ordinary Drink was made of the second Decoction, 
which was used in those days she did not 
sweat, with which was taken the juice of Scurvy-grass 
rightly prepared, six spoonfuls in one 
Draught; in her Broths was used the Salt of the 
same. By the blessing of the Almighty, she was 
by these Remedies perfectly cured, beyond the expectation 
of her Lord and Friends. 
 
[}OBSERV. II.}] 
 
WIlliam, Earle of Northampton, labouring of 
the heat of Urine, April 4. 1622. was 
cured as followeth. +R Cassia new drawn +o i. Terbentine 
washt +Q i. Rubarb +q i. Liquoris powdered +q +s. 
[^p.4^] 
make them in a bole with Sugar. The next day and

and add Syrup of French Mallowes +o vi. Dose +o iv. 
or v. every morning; at night when he went to 
bed, he took +Q +s of Cyprus Terbentine, in the form 
of a Pill in a rosted Apple. Thus was he presently 
and perfectly cured, being at Ludlow, at that 
time being President of Wales, and Councellor to 
the King. 
 
[}OBSERV. III.}] 
 
Mrs. Smith of Stratford upon Avon, aged 54, 
being miserably afflicted with a hot Distillation 
in her Eyes, so that she could not open them 
in the morning, was cured thus. First there was 
administred for four nights together when she went 
to bed, +Q +s. of Pil. de Succin. Craton. made in three 
Pills. These gave five or six stools without 
pain the following days. In the interim, to 
the Eyes was applied the following, +R of the 
Juyce of Housleek a spoonful, White-wine two spoonfuls, 
mix them together: Of which there was dropt 
one or two drops into the Eyes, laying upon them 
all night a double linnen Rag wet in the same; 
this mitigated the heat. After I commanded 
to distill one or two drops of the following into 
the eyes twice or thrice a day: 
[/1./] 
+R Sarcocol wash'd. +Q iij. Prepared 
Tutty +Q ij. Aloes +Q i. White Sugar-Candy

in his Eyes, was cured by the following Medicines.

and Temples the following Plaster, +R Bole 
Armoniack +o +s. Gypsum +Q iii. Dragons blood, Acaciæ,

Upon the Eyes were applied Whites of Eggs 
well beaten with Rosewater and Womans milk. Into 
the Eyes were dropp'd twice or thrice a day some 
of our Opthalmick Collyrium, prescribed in the former 
Observation. This is remarkable, that a 
while after it was used, he found the taste of the 
Sarcocol on his Palat. By these Remedies he was 
cured, blessed be God. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}OBSERV. V.}]

ELizabeth Hall, my only Daughter, was vexed 
with Tortura Oris, or the Convulsion of the 
Mouth, and was happily cured as followeth: 
First, I exhibited these Pills: +R Pil. Coch. & Aurear. 
ana +Q i. f. Pil. 10. She took five the first 
day, which gave her seven Stools; the next day 
with the other five she had five stools. I fomented 
the part with Theriac. Andromac. and Aq. 
Vitæ. To the Neck was used this: +R Unguent. 
[^p.32^] 
Martiat. magn. +o i. Ol. Laurin. Petrolei, Castor. & 
Terebinth. ana +Q +s. de lateribus +Q +s. Misc. By this 
she had great advantage, her Courses being obstructed. 
Thus I purged her: +R Pil. ftid. +Q i.

of the bigness of Pease; they gave eight stools. 
The next day she took Aq. Ophthalm. see Obser. 3. 
as +R Tutiæ, &c. her Courses flowed. For an 
Ophthalmia, of which she laboured, I used our 
Ophthalmick Water, dropping two or three drops 
into her Eye. Her Courses staying again, I gave the 
following Sudorific Decoct. +R Lign. Vitæ +o ii. Sassafras 
+o +s. Sassap. +o i. Chin. +Q vi. macerat. per 24 hor. in

Sarsap. which was above all to anoint the Neck) 
Jan. 5. 1624 
 
In the beginning of April she went to London. 
and returning homewards, the 22d of the said 
Month, she took cold, and fell into the said Distemper 
on the contrary side of the Face, before 
it was on the left side, now on the rigth; and 
although she was grievously afflicted with it, yet 
by the blessing of God she was cured in sixteen 
days, as followeth: +R Pil. de Succin. +Q +s. Aurear. 
+q i. f. Pil. v. She took them when she went to 
bed. The same night her Neck was anointed 
with Oil of Sassafr. In the morning I gave +Q +s 
of Pil. Ruffi. and again used the said Oil with 
Aqua Vitæ, and dropped into her Eye the Ophthalmick 
Water. The aforesaid Oil being 
wanting, I used the following: +R Pul. Castor.

In the same year, May 24. she was afflicted with 
an Erratick Feaver; sometimes she was hot, and 
by and by sweating, again cold, all in the space 
of half an hour, and thus she was vexed oft in 
a day. Thus I purged her: +R the Roots of Parsly, 
Fennel, each M +s. Elder Bark M ii. Roots of the

rubb'd. An hour after it was used, all the Symptoms 
remitted daily till she was well. Thus was 
she delivered from Death, and deadly Diseases, 
and was well for many years. To God be praise.
