[^An epistle to the reader, four dedicatory verses and an introduction omitted.^] 
[^Extract 1, pp. 9-46^] 
 
[^p.9^] 
THe Cure of the foresaid Euill is manyfolde: to 
wit, inwardly and outwardly, and is performed 
by two speciall remedies: the one Medicinall, and 
the other Instrumentall, without the which fewe good 
workes or Cures in Chyrurgery can be brought to perfection: 
The reason is, because in this Cure, the vncleanenesse 
of the body is such, which feedes the matter 
of the disease. Therefore, first of all the matter must be 
purged, for as it is said, the roote of al the Cure is y=e= wel 
purging of the body, whereby Nature is the better enabled 
to expell and vnburden her selfe of many bad and 
vnprofitable humours. And now (by the fauour of the 
learned) I will therefore begin with remedies Medicinall, 
according to the maner of Method, published by 
Calmatheus, one whome amongst many other learned 
men in Phisicke and Chirurgery, I haue obserued 
most diligently, as it were a Day-starre or Christallin 
cleare looking glasse, following him with feruent zeale 
and earnest desire: by reason (as it seemeth vnto me) he 
was not ignorant in any thing that might make for the 
truth of his writing, chiefly for the Cure of the foresaid 
Euill. Yet (I protest) I am no such deuote fauorite of 
his, or any other mans whatsoeuer, further then iustly 
they haue deserued: which is the onely cause that hath 
mooued mee to haue a reuerent estimation of him and 
all other learned men, whether they doe remaine beyond 
the Sea, or otherwise abide with vs at home. 
 
NOw followeth the maner of Methode, by Phisicall 
[/1./] 
remedies for the Cure of Struma, or the Euill 
which our Kings or Queenes haue and doe 
still Cure: the experimentall proofe thereof I haue often 
times seene effected: wherefore I will be short, and 
presently proceede vnto the first intention. 
 
[^p.10^] 
[}The first Intention Phisicall by 
Inward meanes.}] 
 
THe first Intention (after Calmatheus) in 
the 12. Chap. of his book, for the general 
cure of Vnnaturall Tumours, is that the 
curing of this disease called Struma, doth 
co~sist in Dyet that dryeth moderately, & 
heateth and attenuateth the humours: 
Hunger is profitable, and fulnes is hurtfull: Sleep and 
Idlenes are euill: exercise before meate very good: 
(the vse of Sulphure or Alume water, is very good and 
profitable. 
 
[}The second Intention Phisicall 
by Inward meanes.}] 
 
THe second Intention is the vse of breaking, attenuating, 
mundifying & opening Medicaments; as 
are these Remedies now following. viz. 
 
Recipe. Rad, Ireos. Cort. Sambucj. 
 
Boiled in white wine, then adde vnto this decoction, a 
quantity of Ginger. For this decoction breaketh, attenuateth, 
openeth, & mundifieth dolorous tumors: so doth 
it also prouoke vrine, w=t= in this affect is aspecial matter. 
 
The often vse of the Pilles of Hiera simplex is much 
commended to cast out Flegme of the stomacke & guts. 
 
But if so be that thou wilt purge the whole body, thou 
shalt vse the Pilles of Agarico Coccis: if thou list to dissolue 
& cast out Phlegme, these Pils following must be 
taken, viz. Pillulæ de Sagap: de Opopan, de Elleboro, de 
Euphorbio. The Phisitians intimes past commended 
the powder of Turbith, Ginger, and Suger, of each equall 
parts: The Doses whereof was to two Dragmes. 
 
[^p.11^] 
[}The third Intention Phisicall 
by Inward meanes.}] 
 
THe third Intention is the vse of this powder, 
which doth consume (as they terme it) the Antecedent 
matter, which it doth aswell by his manifest 
quality, and (as they say) by a secret property. 
 
This powder doth consume Phlegme, by little & little.

them in white Wine vntill halfe, & giueth euery third 
day one quarter therof. 
 
Galen approoueth & commendeth the vse of Theriaca 
Vetus, Athanasia et Ambrosia. The vse of Aurea Alexa~drina 
for the co~forting of y=e= stomach, is very good. Also it is said 
[^p.12^] 
that Theriaca Athanasia doe both resolue, breake and 
digest humours, being compact and gathered together 
in the profundity of the body. 
 
Mercurialis saith moreouer, that about the purging of 
[/2./] 
children (which is diligently to be obserued) the state of 
children is weake, that it must bee handled with verie 
gentle medicines, & rather to be often repeated, & more 
easier then to minister any stronge Medicines:therfore 
the belly shall thus be mollifyed.

Thus much as concerning this briefe note, or compendious 
Methode of the forenamed Authors, which 
may very well serue for a very fit President or beginning 
[^p.13^] 
to the rest that followeth: Now it remaineth 
that I make heere also report of the singular and rare 
efficacy of our manuel operation therunto annexed and 
belonging, with the right vse of the topicall or outward 
remedies, which is to be externally applyed. The reason 
is, because it is referred vnto the skilfull Chirurgians 
manuell or handy working, for the Cure of this 
great Infirmity, which doth outwardly affect the superficiall 
parts of the body. 
 
For (as saith Iacobus Ruffus) that to the perfection 
and accomplishing of the foresaid Cure (called, The 
Euill by the King, or Queene Cured) he doth reduce it into 
sixe Intentions Chirurgicall, as followeth. The experimentall 
verifying of his excellent skill in this disease, 
as also in many others, is by diuers worthy men 
often times commended: which Malady doth vexe and 
trouble most pitifully the common sort of people. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
The first Intention is, 
[/3./] 
In Attritione, et Compressione. 
	1 
The second Intention is, 
In Discussione, et Resolutione. 
	2 
The third Intention is, 
In Suppuratione et Maturatione. 
	3 
The fourth Intention is, 
In Incisione et Extractione. 
	4 
The fift Intention is, 
In Corrosione et Mundificatione. 
	5 
The sixt Intention is, 
In Obligatione et Evultione. 
	6 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
 
ALso (after Fuchsius and other learned men) it is accordingly 
to be vnderstood as followeth: who also 
hath written of these Phlegmaticall or Glandulous abcessions 
called Struma. 
 
[^p.14^] 
If (say they) these abscessions that bee seated in the 
stronge parts of the body, and because they are not yet 
olde and inueterate, hauing a thin Cystis that couereth 
them: these are to be appeased and consumed, and after 
dryed vp. 
 
[}The first Intention Chyrurgicall by 
outward meanes.}] 
 
NOw I will set downe Examples and 
Instances for the Cure of the said Malady, 
the which I haue obserued and 
gathered (as heereafter ensueth) for 
the perfection and accomplishing of the 
before named first Intention, if the 
strength and ability of the Patient will serue and admit 
the same. Then one chiefe thing (as you are before 
tolde) is, that the Patient doe keep a thin & sparing dyet, 
which is the efficient cause belonging vnto Phisick. 
The reason is, as I haue noted, that those which are 
thus affected, haue alwaies a great inclinatio~ to a grosse 
disordered liberty of feeding: Therefore the Patient 
must be sustained with such meates, as are agreeable 
to Nature, and to eschew such meates which make 
grosse Iuyce: and not (as it is said) to lay gorge vpon 
gorge. And further yee shall note, though it bee said 
before, that abstinence is greatly to be commended: yet 
you must consider it is not meant, that Nature should 
there by bee enfeebled, or ouerthrowne, and that especially 
in weake bodyes, great care must be had: But 
onely to keepe all possible abstinence, that is to eate and 
drinke sparingly and measurably, onely to preserue the 
strength, and to satisfie Nature: I meane, that it bee 
such as is agreeable to the strength of the Patient, and 
[^p.15^] 
greatnes of the Infirmity. 
 
Likewise it is said, the often vse of purging and bleeding 
on both the Armes, is profitable. Also, it is auailable 
to vse Frictions, Rubbings, Boxings, and Blisterings 
is much praised after purgings, for it stoppeth 
the flowing matter (being applyed vpon the head) by 
revulsion or drawing back, & causeth euacuatio~. Moreouer, 
it is said, y=t= to discusse these kinds of Tumours which 
are found in mooueable parts, & superficially lodged neer 
vnto the outward parts, A plate of Leade is most familiar 
therfore, especially in young persons, by reason of 
the raritye and softnes of the skinne: It is thought vnfit 
(by diuers learned men) to blister Childrens heads 
with Cantharides, it hath been seene to cause much paine 
[/4./] 
and pissing of bloud: but to doe it by aduisement, either 
with Mustard or with Nettles, is good. 
 
Also, many learned men, of a certaine knowledge and 
sound vnderstanding, haue in their bookes greatly 
commended a playster made thus: Recipe. Olde dryed 
Goates dung, Hony and Uineger, being decocted at an 
easie fire, to the consistence of a playster. Also, Doues 
dung mingled with Hony, hath the same effect. So is it 
by me also wel approoued, this plaister called Oxicroceum, 
whose composition is not far to be sought for. 
 
R+. Ceræ, Picis, Colophen, Croci. An. +o. iiii. 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Terebinth, Galbanu~, Ammoniaci. 
Mastici, Olibanum. 
	An. +o. j +Q. iiij. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
 
 
Dissolue the Gums in Uineger, and powder that 
which is to be powdred, & so make a plaister according 
to Arte: Also a plaister of Figs baked and spred, and so 
applyed vpon Struma is approoued good. 
 
Likewise, Oleum Cucumiris Asininus, dropped into the 
eare, on that side where the Struma is, is most effectuall 
to disperse and dissolue. 
 
In like maner, is generally commended Emplastru~ de 
[^p.16^] 
Ranis cum Mercurio, to be appropriate and respectiue in 
this Cure, to consume superfluous humidity, engendring 
this disease. 
 
Howbeit, vpon a time a certaine repyning enuious 
man, being full gorged with a malicious rayling spirit, 
being proudely giuen (in the gall of much bitternesse, 
with many scandalous words, and bragging comparisons 
ill beseeming his person) reported that the aforesaid 
plaister De Ranis was dangerous vnto the patient; 
[/5./] 
and said, who so did holde the contrary opinion, it was 
erroneous, foolish and deceiptfull: by reason (quoth hee) 
of the coldnes of the Quick-siluer: and boldly did seeme 
to maintaine the same, with a number of very spruse 
termes, and picked phrases, like as young Children vse 
to doe, when (in mockery) they counterfeite a strange 
kinde of language, & forsooth placed them as it were in 
Geometrical proportions, as though he had bin the onely 
Son of Archimedes that great Geometritian. In deed 
it is most true saying: That fish which is bred in the durt 
will alwaies taste of Mud: And I told him that I neuer 
yet found any more coldnes in this Playster, then 
there is heate in a paynted fire. But this I doe speake 
vpon mine owne knowledge, that there is as much difference 
in Arte and Iudgement, betweene this odde fellow 
(which would seeme to bee a second Æsculapius) 
and a man replenished with true knowledge indeed, as 
is betweene a Master Cooke and a Scullian of a Kitchin. 
Howbeit, hee said also, that his skill was such, 
that if a man were wounded at Yorke, bring him the 
weapon that hurt the Patient, and he would cure him 
(forsooth) by onely dressing of the weapon, and though 
he neuer see the Patient. As certaine as the Sea burnes. 
And now heere I will surcease to speake any further of 
these matters, for I regarded not such sayings, sith it 
is truely said; Euery man must yeeld an accompt, both of 
[^p.17^] 
his case, and of his labour. Themistocles, a Captaine of 
[/6./] 
the Grecians (as Historians make mention) supposed it 
better to be enuyed of the malicious, then to liue in Idlenes 
and basenes of minde, without doing some good 
for the benefit of his Country and Common wealth, 
wherein he was borne and bred. Now to the second 
Intention, and so in order with the rest as they doe lye, 
and offer themselues vnto vs. 
 
[}The second Intention Chyrurgicall 
by outward meanes.}] 
 
THe second Intention Chirurgicall, is the right 
vse of those remedies which doe mollifye, discusse 
and consume great abscessions, which are not yet 
hard and inueterate. 
 
And that the same is true, may easily be gathered as 
followeth. And for that I wold haue this second Intention 
made plaine (as much as in me lyeth) and also familiarly 
knowne vnto the studyous Reader: I doe 
therfore say. It is meete and conuenient, that those Medicamentes 
which are to bee vsed, be of the Nature and 
property to molifie and discusse, and so to open the powers 
of the skinne by euaporating, breathing and scattering 
abroad, and make thinne the grosse matter and 
Phlegme. Then for the better performance thereof, 
without further discoursing, I will heere presently set 
downe (as it were) a Store-house of diuers and sundry 
[/7./] 
approoued Chirurgicall remedyes, necessary for the curing 
and safe healing of the forenamed Strumaeic and 
Phlegmaticall sicknesse: The which from time to time 
I haue by experience (the Mistris of all Artes and Sciences) 
carefully obserued, and faithfully also collected 
out of the famous writinges of sundry worthy Authors, 
[^p.18^] 
as also out of the fruitefull labours, of diuers 
men famous in experience: whose painful trauailes and 
studyes, haue (at this day) most excellently refined this 
worthy Arte of Chyrurgerie from Barbarisme: otherwise 
it is greatly to be feared, a number at this day had 
not been so skilfull and rich in knowledge, and otherwise, 
as they are said to be. Therefore we ought not to 
thinke any study, paines, or trauaile too great, wherein 
we hope of much benefit to our patients, and also profit 
and commodity to our selues: And heere I must needs 
say, (according to my poore ability) I haue my self been 
very industrious for the common benefit, and good of 
others, truly to set downe diuers approoued remedies of 
mine own collection: wherin (to my knowledge) I haue 
not in al this whole discourse, published any superfluous 
and vnapprooued remedies, or otherwise kept backe any 
worthy secret I had: but as did the Euangelicall and 
heauenly woma~ mentioned in y=e= Scriptures, who presented 
into the Lords Treasury al y=e= wealth & substance 
she had. Notwithstanding, I haue read y=t= men in times 
past did with great care & diligence consecrate & keep secret 
(as a precious treasure vnto the~selues) al such chosen 
& peculiar remedies, w=e= they had experienced & approoued 
for the curing & healing of any dangerous malady: 
and (as it is said) bound themselues by oath one to 
another, not to bewray their Secrets by their bookes or 
writings. Howbeit, I more regarding the publick vtility 
& good of posterity, did w=t= great care & diligence consider 
with my self, what profit can there be to any ma~ to 
bury his labors in the lake of obliuion, or otherwise to 
hide it in the denne of darkenesse. And although I 
know the matter heer spoken of, may seeme a paradox to 
some, & so of smal worth: neuerthelesse, although I am 
none of the greatest Clarks, yet I know it wil be more 
auailable, then some happily doe make account of. For 
which cause I haue laboured w=t= as much perspicuity & 
[^p.19^] 
plainnes, as possible I could, to deliuer the truth of my 
honest & faithful good meaning, so far foorth as God hath 
enabled me in knowledge, skil & memory. Wherefore 
I meane heere presently to make publicke & open testimony 
of the same, though now and then I make a little 
digression, and swarue from my matter, by reason of 
certaine Crosbyters, who haue heertofore (behinde my 
backe, and to my face also) not a little abused me: Howbeit, 
I wil heere conclude this discourse concerning this 
Second Intention Chirurgicall, & doe confesse and considerately 
affirme, that there is but few mens labors at the 
first made so perfect, but that in processe of time & further 
consideration, they may be bettered, corrected and 
amended. Yet I cannot but much maruaile, that wise 
men now a daies are growne to this passe, that they do 
so seriously follow exorcismes and the Illusions of certaine 
Charmes of Clowtes and Rags, which is very 
inhumane and barbarous; neuer practised, neither written 
of, nor allowed by any learned Phisitio~ or Chirurgian 
that euer I yet heard or read of. Howbeit, the 
world is (as it were) led in a stringe & carried away to 
beleeue these vanities, which make a shadow or shew of 
verity for the safe curing of diuers maladies, & sildome 
(they say) misse not: But I know the contrary is true, 
for I haue cured both old & young persons, when these 
Charmers of clowtes & rags, with their incredible operations 
haue failed them, & prooued flat foolery & absurdities. 
But to leaue this new Leach craft, with their doting 
inuentions, I wil here speake of diuers remedies 
very respectiue & appropriate, for the cure of the before 
named infirmity, as a president and example for young 
practizers of Chirurgery to follow. Now vnto the said 
Second Intention, which is first to set downe those special 
remedies, whose properties are to open the pooers 
of the skin, & to soften the hard parts, by insencible transspiration.

I might easily bring in a confused number of other 
remedies to the same end & purpose, out of diuers learned 
mens writings, which heer to repeate were needles, 
and to no great vse, sith I know these may suffice: 
Wherefore I thinke it good to pretermit the nominating 
of the rest, &c. 
 
[}The third Intention Chyrurgicall 
by outward meanes.}] 
 
THe third Intention is, to ripen, open and clense 
suth Phlegmaticall Corruptions and Ulcerous 
Apostumes, which do pertaine to Suppuration: 
This needeth no long discourse, sith it plainely appeareth, 
[^p.23^] 
that these troublesome, hard kernelly swellings, be 
found so rebellious, that they doe resist all emollientes 
and Diaphoreticall remedies before named: by meanes 
wherof it can not be dissolued & consumed as we happily 
would, or do desire. For which causes we are further 
constrained to alter our course, with due consideration, 
that is to wit: Not to leaue the Patient helples, but 
to vse stronger Medicamentes, I meane Suppuratiues, 
as is before said, such as whose property is to bring superfluous 
humours to maturity and ripenes, by 
these and such like Emplasticke remedies, which (as it 
is said) doe by the closing of the pooers of the skin, augment 
the naturall heate, whereby the matter so enclosed 
causeth the generatio~ of matter or Pus. But I must 
confesse, I haue not often times seene these hard Phlegmaticall 
abcessions easily brought to suppuration. The 
matter being once colde, dull, Clammy, hard and knotty, 
and deeply seated, and of a long continuance in a body, 
whose skin is grosse and thicke, & the matter hardly 
compact: These kindes (I haue found) do sildome come 
to maturity and ripenes, vnlesse (as Cornelius Celsus 
saith) the said Tumours bee mixed and made of matter 
and bloud. And Trincauel reporteth, that some of these 
[/13./] 
Tumours that haue heate in them, doe ripen and come to 
matter & suppuration: But there be others that be more 
hard, and doe resist suppuration, and then they come 
neerer vnto the nature of a Scirrhus. Now it followeth 
that I set downe those approoued remedies, being 
in vulgar vse, seruing for suppuration, which are long 
agoe ratifyed and well allowed of, by a vniforme consent, 
both of olde & late writers, which were men of an 
industrious capacity, & of a most rare & exquisite knowledge 
in the Arte. And first I wil begin with Iohannes 
de Vigo, one of the chief Fathers, & true Patrones of al 
good learning & knowledge in the Arte of Chirurgery: 
[^p.24^] 
As it (in some sort) may appeare by Master Bartholmew 
Traheron, which first Translated Vigo in the English 
tongue. In his Epistle Dedicatory (whose iudgement 
therein I doe acknowledge) hee sayth: that although 
[/14./] 
Vigo were not brought vp in the knowledge of 
the Tongues, yet through his singular wit, long experience, 
and diligent study, hee hath inuented and set 
foorth, more notable things in the Arte of Chirurgerie, 
then any other heeretofore: and I thinke sayth he, 
nothing can better testifye the cunning of this man, 
then that he continued so long in Rome, in such a company 
of pocky Curtezans: neither Priests, Bishops, 
nor Cardinals excepted, as it appeareth in his Booke: 
for where such cariones been, the best Egles will resort, 
&c.

that the dung of a Cow heated vnder the Ashes, 
betwixt Uine or Colwort leaues, & mingled with vineger, 
hath the property to bring Scrophulous swellings to 
ripenes, &c. Nothwithstanding, if all these chaunce to 
faile, then haue recourse to that which followeth in the 
Fourth Intention, which is perfomed by Section or Incision, 
when wee finde the matter before rehearsed, vnfit 
to yeeld eyther to Resolution or Suppuration, &c, 
 
[}The fourth Intention Chyrurgicall 
by outward meanes.}] 
 
THe fourth Intention of these Strumous Tumors, 
which are not cured by former remedies (& yet are 
gentle, obedient and tractable) is to cut them off, 
and then to pull them out. 
 
In the vse of these outward Incisions, this scope 
ought chiefly to be regarded, that is: to be very circumspect 
in your handy operations, attempted & done co~cerning 
the cure of this great Malady: That is, the apertion 
or opening by launcing or Incision of those glandulous 
Tumors. For as it is said, bloud is the treasure 
of life, and habitation of the soule: Moreouer, it is surely 
very hard and difficult, especially when there is in the 
affected place, eyther Nerue, great Uaine, or Artery, &c. 
[^p.27^] 
Therefore such persons as are to endure this painfull 
action, ought to haue much patience, and to be of a good 
courage: Then it may bee the better attempted and 
done by a cunning and skilfull Chyrurgian: which 
there is no doubt, but he will be so prouident, that nothing 
shall offend. How be it, it is not necessary or sufferable 
ouer curiously to search and attempt the cutting 
them out by Incision: For that many of them are subiect 
to violent and inordinate bloudy Fluxes, and other 
euill accidents, which doubtlesse will much amaze you 
and hinder your handy operation: I meane, when these 
Tumors bee deeply planted, and secretly lodged amongst 
the great vaines and Arteries called Carotides, or otherwise 
neere the Nerui recurrentes, which is often times 
the cause that some bee come speechlesse thereby. And it 
cannot be iustly denyed, but that these Incisions haue 
often times been attempted with a launce by our Ancestors 
& Fore-fathers. But amongst a number of those 
worthy men, Wickar being a man of good knowledge & 
skill in the Cure of the foresaid Euill, his counsaile 
is, that before we doe attempt the said action by Inscision, 
the Patient be first layde vpon his Bed, and so 
both his feet must be strongly tyed vnto the bed poasts, 
his head & both his hands must also be fast held by men 
of strength, and skilfull in holding: In such sort as we 
doe in cutting those which haue the crooked or wrye 
neckes. And he that is chosen to be the Operator of the 
said action, must prudently and wisely (saith Vigo, and 
other learned men) co~sider the greatnes & smalnes of the 
said Tumor, which must be incised & cut fro~ one length 
of the Tumor to an other. Then by litle & litle, seperate, 
diuide & vndermine the whole Cistis round about, to the 
very bottome & roots therof, not rashly, nor by violence, 
but orderly by degrees, seperate w=t= your fingers, & other 
seruiceable instrume~ts, as you vse to diuide y=e= forenamed 
[^p.28^] 
Wennes called Steatoma, Atheroma and Meliceris: And 
confessed it is for a certaine, that if any portion or 
part of the said Cistis or bagge, chaunce to remaine behinde, 
and not cleere taken away by the rootes, it will 
(doubtlesse) breed and increase againe: But to preuent 
such greeuances, me thinkes I cannot speake too 
sufficie~tly therof: wherfore, if any part remain behinde, 
then lay vpon it the powder of Mercury precipitate, or 
(if that bee too weake) adde to it of Alumen Combust, 
or Vitriolum Album combust, of each equall portions: 
notwithstanding I beleeue, & confidently hold, that the 
worke of your hands is the best instruments you haue 
to trust to, and to relieue you in this distresse. 
 
Moreouer, Mercurialis he further sayth these words, 
[/19./] 
for the curing and effecting of this matter: First (saith 
he) choose some light place, & let the Patient lye on his 
bed, for in sitting he wil soone sound:therfore binde his 
legges together, and after binde them to the Bedside, 
and let one holde his head fast, and then the Chirurgean 
taking the swelling in his left hand, let him make 
an Incision, eyther right or straight, or some what crooked, 
on the necke vnder the Iaw-bones, vntill he come 
to the matter inclosed in the Bladder, which is sometimes 
one and single, as in the lesser swellinges, and 
sometimes double, like the Mirtle leafe in the greater 
swellinges: So that conueniently (eyther by the fingers 
or other Instrumentes) the Bladder may bee by 
little and little separated, and drawne from the next 
partes, together with the matter inclosed in it. But 
take good heede that the Bladder be not cut, because it 
is hardly drawne away, and much hindreth the Cure, 
and the euill will come againe: But if any such thing 
chaunce, it were good to consume it with eating Medicines. 
Great care must also be had, that neyther the Arteries, 
vaines, nor notable Nerues be burt, but by little 
[^p.29^] 
and little gently put it aside. Yet if in the cutting some 
vessell be diuided, and the issue of bloud trouble and hinder 
the worke: then apply some meete thing to stay the 
bloud, and so come againe to your worke: For if the 
lippes of the Incision be inflamed, and the swelling or 
Struma bee not safely dissolued away: then lay on a 
Stupa beaten with the White of an Egge, and such 
things as be good for stopping of bloud. After, apply 
Medicines that wil a little concoct, and then vse abstersiues, 
and next such as causeth fleshe to growe and heale 
vp the scarre. 
 
[}The fifth Intention Chyrurgicall 
by outward meanes.}] 
 
THe fifth Intention is, those which are vnmooueable, 
and deepely rooted within, Corrode them about 
and clense them throughly. I graunt it 
tollerable and very conuenient, to vse in this Cure the 
due applycation of Potential Cauteries, such as whose 
propertye and seruice is to corrode the flesh & the skin, 
and may with very good circumspection very safely be 
attempted, being administred vpon a body that is of a 
reasonable constitution, & in such sort that his strength 
is able to holde and endure the same. And heere I will 
make further demonstration thereof, that is to say: 
that your Cautery be not applyed vpon any Sinnewy 
part, neither vpon the great Vaines nor Arteries, for 
that these bee accompted indeede principall and chiefe 
vessels: Also you must consider the quallity and quantity 
of the Causticke you doe administer, for that some 
are more violent and stronger then other, and some wil 
run and spread more then another. 
 
Iaques Guillemeau Chyrurgian vnto the now French 
[^p.30^] 
King which now is: saith, truely it is not necessary, nor 
allowable to apply the Caustick vpon the endes or beginnings 
of Muscles, for if your Patient that is to bee 
Cauterized, haue an vnsound and sickly body, you must 
first of all bee sure before you administer the sayd 
Cautery, to Phlebotomize & purge him: The reason 
is, least in the Cauterized parts, there chaunce to come 
concursion, or gathering together of humours. Also, it 
is further sayd, that a small part of your potentiall 
Cauteryes, doth and will worke as forcibly on a soft 
and tender bodye, as a great quantity thereof will doe 
vpon a stronge and grosse obdurate person. Ouer and 
besides, the greater abcessions are to bee Cauterized 
one way, and the lesser an other way, and that with 
good consideration. And heere to put you in memory, 
that you must bee very carefull and circumspect in 
defending the partes round about the sayd Tumors, for 
feare (as I haue said) that your Cautery doe run and 
spread too farre abroad: for the which cause you shall 
strengthen, fortifye & defend the foresaid affected parts, 
that is to say: by inuironing and compassing it round 
about with some repercussiue Medicamentes, lest the 
grieued part (which by long infirmity is become thereby 
sore weakned & enfeebled) and may so bring with it 
great swelling & other euill accidents: And therfore it is 
not without good cause, that the parts greeued be rightly 
ordred & defended, whereby you shall be sure the better 
to effect your intented purpose without the said perrill 
or daunger but with the highest commendation in 
preuenting the euil that otherwise might ensue: which 
reasons alwaies enduced mee to laye round about the 
Cauterized parts, some speciall defensiue, as is this, or 
the like heereafter following.

Et fiat Emplastrum. 
 
This done, then presently goe about with your Causticke, 
to roote out all the whole Schrophulous and hard 
kernelly substances, either with the common Ruptory 
or Causticke, which in this case best contenteth my 
minde: the making heereof I doe not heere set downe, 
because it is so commonly knowne. 
 
Howbeit, there is an other Causticke, which (as it 
is reported vnto me by a skilful Chirurgian) doth work 
without any paine, or very litle at al. The reputed Author 
therof is said to bee a famous practizer in Chirurgery, 
dwelling at Mountpelier in France. I must needes 
thinke reuerently of the Author of this Caustick, hoping 
his minde was not such to delight himselfe with 
publishing of vntruth: But if it doe indeede worke 
without paine, the mistery thereof is farre aboue my 
reach.

You shall further note, that if at any time your Causticke 
doe happen not to worke so well and sufficiently 
to your minde, as happily you would wish it should do, 
then apply the same Cautery againe: but you must first 
make Incision alongst wise, vpon the middle of the 
foresaid Escharre: Then put in some small quantity 
(that is, so much as you suppose will penetrate into 
the profundity & very rootes therof) for it doth behooue a 
prouident & wise Artist to preuent & see all eminent danger 
in y=e= doing therof, & the~ by Gods help, ye may safely 
in a short time roote out these hard Strophulous Tumors. 
For (as I haue said) vnlesse the roote be cleane take~ out. 
[^p.32^] 
this Malady will growe and increase againe. But if 
there chaunce to approach any painefull accidentes 
(as I haue knowne and seene to follow in sundry persons) 
then with speed remooue and take away the 
same: which done, yee shall procure the fall of the 
Eschar, with Vnguentu~ Populeum: or els with Vnguentum 
Rosarum, or sweete Butter. And to apply vpon 
it Emplastrum Diacalcitheos, or Emplastrum Deminio. 
So after all the Escharres be remooued, then if there 
be required mundifying and clensing, these following 
are vulgarly vsed, as Vnguentum Apostoloru~, called of 
some also Vnguentum Christianoru~: which Vnguent in 
this effect cannot be bettered: and Vnguentum Egiptiacum, 
and sometimes to mixe two parts of Vnguentum 
Apostolorum, and one part of Vnguentum Egiptiacum. 
Also, Vnguentum Apij, is auaileable in this Cure, viz.

If you adde to this Vnguent the yolkes of Egges 
and Mercury Præcipit. it doth worke much better. Also 
the powder of Mercury præcipit. is good of it selfe, and 
if you will haue it worke more forcibly, adde vnto it of 
Allum combust according to discretion. With these 
foresaid remedyes you may continue vntill there appeare 
pure and quicke flesh: then it followeth to vse Incarnatiues, 
& Agglutinatiues, with other medicamte~s, 
fit for consolidation. 
 
Thus hauing sufficiently intreated of the fifth Intention: 
now it remaineth for a full conclusion, to present 
[^p.33^] 
in order last of all, the sixt Intention, as followeth. 
 
[}The sixth Intention Chyrurgicall 
by outward meanes.}] 
 
THe sixt Intention Chirurgicall is, that in those 
Strumas that are fastened but to a thinne and slender 
roote, you shall binde them about and plucke 
them out. This last action (as it appeareth) is verie 
easily performed by a skilfull Operator or cunning 
Chirurgian: neyther doth it require any great curiosity, 
but a decent and artificiall strong binding, meete 
for the plucking of them out (as it is said) by the rootes. 
In which action you neede not feare any great perrill 
of Fluxe of bloud, but that it may easily bee restrained 
with my restringent powder, published in my last booke 
of Obseruations, which hath (of a number of good Artistes) 
a friendlye acceptation: If it chaunce through 
the ill disposition of the body, any dolorous accidentes 
doe happen to follow, then mitigate the same (sayth 
Wicker) with stupes wet in the white of an Egge, and 
oyle of Roses: and afterwards if there growe filthynes, 
let it be clensed with those remedyes before rehearsed: 
then no fault being committed through negligence 
or want of skill, you shall no doubt with good successe, 
finish this last Intention. But amongst a number of 
excellent remedyes for the curing of this euill (after the 
partes bee throughly clensed from all annoyances) this 
Playster following hath all the properties, that is 
prescribed in these kindes of remedyes before named: 
Which noble Playster I obtained of one Isack a stranger 
[/23./] 
borne, a famous Incisioner and Licentiate Chirurgian 
of London, who for his excellent knowledge in 
[^p.34^] 
his Arte, was called beyond the Seas, The golden Master 
or Doctor.

With this Playster onely I cured a Bricklayers 
Daughter neere London, of diuers bad Scrophulous Ulcers 
in her necke and throate. Howbeit, there be some 
(who are as it were so nose-wise) that forsooth they can 
not abide to read any medicine, that is of a long composition, 
be it neuer so precious. Contrariwise, there 
be others againe, that will not endure to read a short 
composition, bee it neuer so well approoued: for they 
plainely say, there can bee no great matter of worth in 
them: And thus they are as variable in their opinions 
(for want of true Arte and iudgement) as the Camelions 
be in their colours. Quot capita tot sensus: so many 
heades so many opinions. Now heere I will forbeare 
[^p.35^] 
any further to discourse of this Sixt Intention Chirurgicall, 
but I will set downe certaine Obseruations 
for the Cure of this greeuous Malady by me perfected, 
as followeth: least otherwise happily it may bee 
said, He that telleth a long processe or boasting tedious 
tale without some proofe, must needs require credit, either 
for his long boasting tedioustale, or else for some speciall 
Authority that is in his person. But as for boasting amongst 
wise men, it can winne litle credit. 
 
[}An obseruation.}] 
 
A Few monthes past there was sent vnto 
me by a Gentleman of Essex, a certaine 
husband man, being about the 
Age of thirty yeeres, who was molested 
(for the space of sixe monthes) with 
certaine ourward swellings, or vnnaturall 
Strumous Abscessions: some of them were great 
with notable hardnesses, some meane, and some smaller, 
being for the most part packed and heaped together, 
but yet mooued too and fro, hyther and thyther: For 
the which he was first purged (with great moderation 
and aduisement) with the pilles of Euphorbium and 
Trochisce ex Viperis: or the Pilles of Vipers, and he did 
take many times Theriaca Andromachj, & kept a very 
slender dyet withall: after hee was well purged from 
grosse and rawe humours, then I applyed vpon his 
necke and both his shoulders 3 great cupping glasses, 
and so did draw bloud and humours in good quantity. 
After the application of this kinde of Boxing or Ventoses, 
then presently I applyed vpon his swelling this 
Vnguent, and these Plaisters following. 
 
[^p.36^] 
Recip. Colewort leaues, greene Leekes and blades: 
[/24./] 
of water Betonye, Motherwort, the lesse Plantine, 
Daysie leaues and Flowers, Mallows, Nicotian, 
and Pelitory of the wall, of each a handfull: 
Beate and shred these hearbes very fine: then adde to 
these foresaid hearbes of Wine Uineger lib. ii. of Hogs 
grease and sweet Butter, of each lib. ii. of oyle of Almonds 
lib. j. a yong Fox, of earth worms, & shel snailes, 
of each lib. i. Let all these lye infused & buryed in horse 
dung the space of a month, then boyle all together till 
the watrynes be consumed: then strayne it strongly, & 
heerewith morning and euening anoynt his necke very 
warme, for halfe an houre together: Then applyed 
I Emplastrum de ranis cum Mercurio: and at other 
times, Emplastrum Dyachilon maius, et de Muscilaginibus, 
of each equal portions: and by this way and order 
of curing, he was by me cured and safely healed within 
the space of 40. dayes. 
 
[}Another obseruation.}] 
 
[/25./] 
VPon a time there was brought vnto me 
a certaine Master of a Ship, by a Seruant 
of mine, called Robert Coulter, a 
man who (for his knowledge and skill 
in the Arte of Chirurgery) was greatly 
esteemed of diuers Nobles, and worthy 
Persons. This Master of the Ship was mightily 
infected with many Vlcerous Strumaes in his necke, 
throate and brest, with much out-growing flesh, loathsome 
and vnpleasant to beholde: his hard swelling exceeded 
in number, magnitude and greatnesse: he had a 
crasie and vnsound body: his minde much troubled 
with pensiuenesse and melancholy fansies. Therfore 
being loath to admit any thing needfull, or commit any 
[^p.37^] 
thing hurtfull, I did take the aduise and counsaile of a 
graue and learned Phisitian: who prepared and purged 
his body from much crude and rawe indigested excrementall 
humours, with the Pilles of Sagapenum 
de Agarico Coctiæ. An +Q. +s. Misce. In like manner he 
did set him downe a good regiment of dyet, which was 
thinne and sparing and light of digestion. He also forbad 
him eating and drinking at vnaccustomed houres: 
also he did refraine those meates that were grosse and 
tough: as Beefe, Milke, fryed Egges, hard cheese, all 
pulse and nuttes, and other meates which cause thicke 
Iuyce: Also he did appoint him after his first purgings 
euery morning and euening for a space, to receiue this 
drinke following, which procured him to auoyde much 
Phlegmaticke rawe humours, especially by Urine.

And for that this my Patient was subiect to much 
Restriction of his belly: hee did also admit him to forbeare 
the foresaid drinke, and to drink of this Laxatiue

Now for that his Ulcers were many, and subiect

of the hotte distemperature, and did subdue the 
whole Scrophula, following Vigoes direction: after 
Incision I did put againe of the Causticke into the

after caused him to auoyde much noysome matter and

I found this aforesaid Vnguent very commodious

their operation for the cure of the said Struma, is approoued 
profitable.

This place will not admit me heere orderly, to set 
downe at large, those great cures which I haue seene 
healed by other Chirurgians, of whome I obtained the 
knowledge of the foresaid remedyes: And I haue also 
with the same, cured and healed many of the like cures, 
but especially in the curing of fraudule~t Ulcers in Ano. 
the said remedy being Artificially make and prepared 
according to the Chymistes Arte, the subiect is onely 
Plumbj rub. et. Acet j. fort. Also I haue thought it good to 
set downe the manner of making the foresaid Ol. Ouor. 
that is: take 20. or 30. Egges, more or lesse, & let them 
be sodden very hard: which done, lay a side the whites, 
and reserue onely the yolks [^ORIG. BLURRED^] let them be wel laboured 
and beaten in a cleane morter: then put them into a 
Frying pan, & cause the~ be well fryed, continually stirring 
them, till it come to an Oylye substance, and after 
presse it foorth according to Arte.

Put the Uarnish in a litle broad earthen Pan, being 
made flat and well nealed, the bignes of a great Sawcer, 
and strewe in the Litarge by little and little, and stir 
it together euery two houres, and it will in the end 
come to a certaine hardnesse, in such sort that you may 
beate it to powder, and strew of this powder vpon your 
Pledgets, for the cure of y=e= outward Abscession, which 
likewise troubled him greatly, being so hard, nody and 
knotty, so that I feared they would haue degenerate 
into a Scirrhus, but I did mollify and dissolue them with 
these remedyes following.

Recipe. Turnips and Lilly rootes An. lib +s. boyled 
in stronge Ale or Malmesey, q. s. which being 
boyled very tender, then straine gently foorth the lyquors, 
and beate the roote very well in a stone morter, 
and adde therunto Beane meale and Barly meale, and 
Ote-meale, of each a handfull: then take the liquors 
[/31./] 
that the fore named rootes were boyled in, and adde 
thereunto Marsh Mallow rootes two handfuls, of 
Fenygreke and Lineseede, each of them a handfull. 
Let these stand infused 12. houres, then boyle it to a 
thicknesse, and so straine it strongly. Then take of this 
Mussilage lib. +s. and adde to it also Oyle of Lineseede

Also, I often vsed Emplastrum de Ranis. cum Mercurio 
et Emplastrum Dyachilon maius, Emplastrum de 
Muscilaginibus, as is before named: And thus I cured 
this Sea-faringman, and so continued (to my knowledge) 
11. yeares: in the end hee dyed in the last voyage 
with Sir Frances Drake.

[}An Obseruation of a Maide, whose 
friends supposed she had the Euill before 
rehearsed, when I was but a young Professor 
in this faculty and Arte of Chyrurgerie.}] 
 
ABout thirty yeeres past (as it were in 
[/32./] 
the minority of this my practice) I did 
obserue there was brought vnto me (by 
a Preacher, then being Uicar of Yalding, 
a towne in Kent) a Maiden about 
the age of 22. yeares, hauing a stronge 
and able body, and of a reasonable good constitution, 
who was supposed to haue that Euill, called Struma. 
Yee shall vnderstand, this Uicar was a man that did 
practise both Phisicke and Chirurgery: this Mayden 
was a long time troubled with an Ulcer in one of her 
legges, and a great swelling in one side of her necke: 
which Maladyes, the foresaid Uickar did take vpon 
him to cure and heale: how be it, in continuance of time 
he grew weary of his worke, and tolde a neighbour of 
his, called Master Eden (a Gentleman dwelling also in 
Yalding) that the Maide his Patient (as hee supposed) 
had the Queenes Euill (which Gentlemans Daughter 
not long before I had cured of the same:) The sayd 
Gentleman perswaded the Vicar not to spend time too 
long, but to cause her to bee sent vp to London to mee, 
whose counsaile presently he followed, & the Uicar and 
[/33./] 
the Maide and her father consulted together, and came 
to mee to London, and she wed me her griefe, and the 
continuance of the same. So after diligent [^ORIG. BLURRED^] taken 
by me, I found it was not the Euil (as he supposed) but 
[^p.42^] 
a sort of crude and rawe humours, flocking together in 
her neck, with a putrifyed corrupt Vlcer vpon her right 
leg, & so I told him he was deceiued in her griefe. Then 
they went their way and asked further counsell, which 
all were of my opinion. Then they came vnto me the 
next day, and I did vndertake the cure with the counsaile 
of one Doctor Spering a graue and learned Phisition, 
who prescribed her an order of dyet, with conuenient 
purging. It is to be noted, hee gaue vnto her 
in three seuerall boxes, three sundry purgations to be 
taken at three seuerall times, set downe in writing 
very plainely, as might be deuised. In like maner I 
deliuered vnto them all such locall remedies as was fit 
for both her griefes: amongst the rest I noted in writing, 
that the first thing shee should vse vnto the Vlcer 
on her legge, was Vnguentum Ægiptiacum, which I 
made very strong, and of a high and thicke body, for 
that I would haue her spred it vpo~ pledgets somwhat 
thick, and after to proceede with other meete remedies. 
 
But note what ill hap followed by the Maydes 
carelesnes, and too much negligence: In the morning 
after she came home to Yalding by 7. of the clocke, and 
tooke one of the 3. Purgations which the Doctor gaue 
vnto her to take, shee set it vpon a stoole by the fire, 
where shee meant first to dresse her legge: in conclusion 
(by great ouersight) she laide the Purgation to her 
legge, and did eate vp the whole boxe of Aegiptiacum, 
which was nere 2. oun. and (as she said afterwards) it 
was very vntoothsome and loathsome in tasting. All 
this while for two hours space she felt litle working of 
it, but did begin in the end greatly to burne, & did complaine 
in her stomacke, throate & mouth, and casted extreamely, 
& also shortly after purged downe very greatly, 
& thus continued for the space of one day, & one night 
before she sought for helpe. In the end, the Uicar was 
[^p.43^] 
not to be found, but stayed at London, then they sent 
vnto Maidestone to an Italian Phisitian called Santa-Cilia, 
[/34./] 
and he being giuen to vnderstand by them, that by 
meanes of a purgation, shee was in a great burning 
heate in her body, & purged & vomitted too aboundantly, 
and so wanted sleepe greatly, for the which hee gaue 
them a prescript vnto the Apothecary: but first that 
they themselues should apply her with butter-milke, 
and new milke, and some good fat Mutton brothes: and 
to helpe [^ORIG. BLURRED^] her purging, he counsailed them to giue 
her to drinke oftentimes, Red-wine and Conserue of 
Sloes together, and to procure her to sleepe with this 
potion following. 
 
[/35./] 
R+. Diascordij. +Q i. +s.

But this did small pleasure. The next night hee sent 
her this ensuing.

With this she had some comfort, but not to that purpose 
they looked for: so after the third night, in the next 
morning they sent with all speede to my house in London 
with a letter, of the great daunger she was in, & the 
Phisitians billes with all what she had done: and presently 
I sent it to D. Spering, who was greatly greeued 
to heare of it, & said he was sure there was some extraordinary 
matter in it, for the purgations he sent would 
neuer bring her into such danger. The~ after he had well 
considered of the matter, & present daunger that might 
[^p.44^] 
ensue, hee prescribed foorthwith that his Apothecary 
should make first, for to coole and quench her great and 
extreame thirst, and to helpe her to her tasting againe, 
this Iulip which was thus made. 
 
Rec. Barly Water lib. iiii. Conserue of red Roses 
and of Barberyes, of each 2. Oun: Whereunto was 
added 20. droppes of Oyle of Uitrioll. Misce. 
 
And then she did drinke for a space, which wrought 
to good effect in cooling of her, & so brought her to a good 
taste againe. For the staying of the Fluxe of her Belly 
and Uomiting, she tooke of this Electuary at diuers 
times a day, the quantity of 3. Oun. at a time. The making 
heereof is as followeth:

it come vnto the thicknes of an Electuary, &c. 
 
He gaue also vnto her the first night, a Pill of Ladanum, 
onely to procure sleepe and quiet rest, and caused 
her to be couered with many cloathes, and so procured 
sweate: Thus within an houre and a quarter shee fell 
a sleepe, and rested quietly vntill nine of the clocke the 
next morning, and neuer casted nor went to the stoole: 
and (being awaked) confessed shee was greatly refreshed, 
and felt no paines at all till towards night, and then 
shee casted a litle, and went now and then to the stoole: 
[^p.45^] 
for which cause she tooke her foresaid Electuary. She 
earnestly required to haue another Pill, but the Doctor 
gaue his direction to the contrary, and would first 
see how Nature did dispose her selfe: so the night following 
she rested but litle, how be it a great deale better 
then before. Then the third night hee gaue her the second 
Pill, and after that she neuer vomitted or purged 
disorderly againe: the excellency of these remedyes is 
aboue beliefe and vncredible, that I haue done and seen 
done by these last worthy remedyes, both by Sea and 
by land The seauenth day after she had receiued her infortunate 
Purgation of Ægiptiacu~, then speeches was 
made by me to see the Ulcer of her legge, but they regarded 
it not; in the ende she opened it, and found it almost 
cleane cured, then shee commended mee, and so did 
her friends for this my excellent remedy: but shee said 
would neuer take the like Purgation againe, for a 
thousand pound: thus she was cured by Fortune and 
not by Arte. Then I required of her, where the Boxes 
were, that the Purgations and the Vnguentum Aegiptiacum 
were in? she said she threwe them both into the 
fire: For (said shee) the Purgation had a filthy taste, 
and was so clammy, and so sticked to her mouth and 
teeth, that I had neuer so much a doe (said she) to get it 
downe my throate. Then I perceiued shee had taken 
the wrong thing, & it was the more apparant by reason 
of the blacknes of her teeth, & the staines of her cloathes 
wherwith she had often wiped her mouth: and also by 
staining of the Basons and the dishes, wherin she had 
so often times vomitted. After this I stayed with her 
ten daies, til her legge and mouth was perfectly cured, 
and then wee were royally payde, and thus went to 
London to the Doctor, and tolde him what had hapned, 
that she had eaten the boxe of Aegiptiacum, and layde the 
Purgation to her legge, whereat he was greatly grieued: 
[^p.46^] 
and much controuersie in speeches was after 
betweene the Doctor and the Maides father, but in the 
ende they were made friends. 
 
Now I will set downe the composition of the said 
Pill of Ladanum, which I obtained of a very deere 
friend, being a pretious Iewell, as it is vsed: otherwise, 
(as I haue said in other of my writings) the best Medicine 
that is, is no Medicine vnlesse it be in the hands 
of a skilfull man.
