[}The Cures of the 
Diseased, in remote 
Regions.}] 
 
[}THE CALENTURE.}] 
 
THe Calenture (or burning 
Feuer) called by 
the Spaniards, La Calentura, 
is the most vsuall 
Disease, happening to 
our Nation in intemperate 
Climats, by inflammation of blood, 
and often proceeding of immoderate 
drinking of wine, and eating of pleasant 
Fruits, which are such nourishers thereof, 
as they preuent the conuenient meanes, 
that are vsed in curing the same. 
 
[^f.B1v^] 
[}To know the Calenture.}] 
 
THe Calenture at the first apprehension 
afflicts the Pacient with great 
paine in the head, and heate in the bodie; 
which is continuall or increasing, 
and doth not diminish and augment as 
other Feuers doo: and is an introduction 
to the Tabardilla, or Pestilence; whereof 
next is intreated: but then the bodie 
will seeme very yellow. 
 
[}To cure the Calenture.}] 
 
SO soone as the Pacient is perceiued 
to be possest of the Calenture; except 
the Chirurgion defer it for danger of the 
Signe (I haue seene the time of the day 
not respected) to open the Median veine 
of the right arme, and take such quantitie 
of blood, as agreeth to the abilitie 
of the bodie, which not asswaging the 
heate, by the next day; to open the same 
[^f.B2r^] 
Veine in the left arme, and take so much 
more blood at his like discretion. And 
the bodie being Costiue (for so commonly 
the Pacients are) to giue him some 
meete Purgation; and not to permit 
him to drinke other then water coolde, 
wherein Barley & Anniseedes haue been 
sodden with brused Licorice. And if within 
foure daies the partie doo not amend, 
or being recouered doo take it againe; 
then open the Sephalica veine, in one or 
both hands, bathing them in warme 
water, vntill there comes so much more 
blood as cause requires. And not to suffer 
the Pacient to drinke, seuen dayes after 
he is perfectlie recouered, any other 
drinke, then such water as herein is directed. 
 
[}THE TABARDILLA.}] 
 
THe Disease called by the Spaniards, 
La Tabardilla, and by the 
Mexicans, Cocalista, is named 
by other Indians, Taberdet: and is so exceeding 
[^f.B2v^] 
Pestilent and infectious, as by 
the same, whole Kingdomes in both the 
Indias haue been depopulated: which 
seemeth to insue of the ignorance of the 
sauage people, to minister redresse to 
themselues. For the Spaniards and Portugals 
there inhabiting, and in their natiue 
Countries, where it is also contagious, 
before they had this knowledge, did aboundantlie 
die thereof. But now by applying 
the meanes here described, they 
are recouered of the same. 
 
[}To know the Tabardilla.}] 
 
THe Tabardilla first assaults the Pacient 
very veheme~tly, with pain in the 
head and backe: and the bodie seeming 
yellow, is some signe thereof, and within 
24. howres it is so torturous, that he that 
is possest therof, cannot sleep or rest, turning 
himselfe on either side, backe and 
bellie; burning in his backe most extreamely. 
And when it growes to perfection, 
[^f.B3r^] 
there will appeare red and blew 
spots vpon the Pacients brest and wrists. 
And such persons as haue not presently 
applyed vnto them, meanes requisite to 
preuent it, will be by the incomparable 
torment thereof, depriued of their wits. 
And multitudes haue desparingly slaine 
and drowned themselues, that by losse 
of their liues, they might finish their terrestriall 
paine. 
 
[}To cure the Tabardilla.}] 
 
WHen the Tabardilla is perceiued 
to afflict the Pacient, permit him 
not to lie very warme, nor vpon Feathers 
(for of what qualitie soeuer he is in 
Spayne, hauing this sicknes, he is layd vpon 
Wheate straw:) Then immediatly open 
the Median veine, first in one arme, 
and the next day in the other, taking a 
good quantitie of blood: And let him 
haue water colde, wherein Barley and 
Anniseedes haue been sodden, without 
[^f.B3v^] 
Licorice (for I haue heard the opinion of 
good Phisitions of Spayne, that Licorice 
is hurtfull vnto them) so much as he will 
desire, which will be euery moment: but 
no other drinke, nor any raw fruits: and 
so soone as the spots appeare, giue him 
some Cordiall potion: and laying him 
vpon his bellie, set sixe Uentoses together 
in his backe, betweene and beneath the 
shoulders. And scarifying them, draw 
out (if it bee a bodie of strong constitution) 
18. ounces of blood. After which, 
and that he hath slept, he will feele ease 
within 24. houres, and finde such alteration 
in himselfe, as he will thinke that he 
is deliuered of a most strange torment. 
Then giuing him nourishing meats moderatly 
(for he will desire to eate much) 
the fourth day giue him some co~uenient 
Purgation. And if in the meane while he 
is Costiue, prouoke him euery day by 
Clisters: and admonish him to forbeare 
fifteene daies all other drinke, then that 
is ordained. And to bee carefull of his 
[^f.B4r^] 
diet: for if this Tabardilla, which we call 
here in England, Gods Tokens, come againe 
vnto the Pacient, he can hardly escape 
it. And it is no lesse infectious, then 
the vsuall English Plague. 
 
[}THE ESPINLAS.}] 
 
THe Espinlas is a very strange 
sicknes, and vsuall in those 
parts, to such as take cold in 
their breasts, after great heat 
or trauell. And most times it comes to 
those that lye with their breasts vpon the 
ground (especially) in the night. 
 
[}To know the Espinlas.}] 
 
THe partie hauing the Espinlas, will 
be giddie in the head, and haue pain 
and pricking at his breast, as with many 
thornes: wherefore I thinke it is so called 
of Spina and Espina, the Latine and 
Spanish words for a Thorne. And there 
[^f.B4v^] 
will be vpon Huesso radio, or Focell; being 
the vpper bone of his arme, a hand 
breadth aboue the wrist, a little kernell, 
by which it is certainly knowne. And he 
that hath this Disease, will not haue appetite 
to meate or drinke; nor cannot 
digest meate, although he bee procured 
to take it. 
 
[}To cure the Espinlas.}] 
 
THe Espinlas, appearing by the former 
signes: Take Oliue oyle presently, 
and therewith chafe the kernell 
vpon the Pacients arme, vsing so to doe 
twise euery day, vntill it bee dissolued: 
and laying Oyle likewise vpo~ his breast, 
stroke it vpwarde somewhat hard with 
the hand: then spread fine Flaxe vpon it 
and the kernell, making it fast with a 
rowler: and within two or three dayes, 
the diseased thereof will be recouered. 
Whereas els it is very dangerous to depriue 
them of life. 
 
[^f.C1r^] 
[}LAS CAMERAS, OR 
Cameras de Sangre.}] 
 
THAT is Laxatiuenes, or 
Bloodie Fluxe, which in 
those parts proceedes of 
diuers causes. As by eating 
of Grapes, Orringes, 
Limonds, Mellons, Plantans, and especially 
a great Fruit that growes in the VVest 
India, called Pina, like a Pine-apple, but 
bigger then foure of the greatest that I 
haue seene; which the Spanyards doe repute 
to be the most delicate Fruit that is 
there, and many other Fruites. Also by 
sudden colde, or sitting (being very hot) 
vpon a colde stone, or, being hot, by 
drinking Water abundantly. And also 
eating of Butter, Oyle, and Fish, is so hurtfull 
to the parties that haue it, that they 
must refraine to eate thereof: and whatsouer 
els, that defiles the entrailes, with 
any slimie substance. 
 
[^f.C1v^] 
[}To cure Las Cameras, or Cameras 
de Sangre, which is the 
Bloodie Flux.}] 
 
VVIth the more expedition, that 
medicine is ministred to the diseased 
of Cameras de Sangre, Laxatiuenes, 
or Bloodie Flux, there is the more possibilitie 
it should preuaile. And detracting it, 
the Pacients often die suddenly, without 
feeling much griefe. For speedie and assured 
remedie thereof, the Pacients bodie 
must bee clensed of the slimines, engendered 
in the passages of the nutriments; 
before anie sustinance can remaine 
in his bodie. And for that purpose, 
giue to purge him in the morning, 
halfe a pint of white Wine coold, wherin 
1/2. ounce of Rubarb hath been sodden, 
being small cut; putting in some Suger 
Candie to sweeten it. And immediatly after 
he hath so purged, keepe at his nauell 
Rosemarie sodden in strong Vineger, applied 
[^f.C2r^] 
in the morning and euening verie 
hot, vntill it be stayed: giuing him often 
Quinces brused and rowled in Marmelet 
like Pils, which hee should swallowe 
whole, and none of the Fruits, or meates 
before recited, nor any more white wine, 
but red wine of any sort. And if it be on 
Land, the liuers of Goates (especiallie) 
Sheepe, or Bullocks rosted: not willingly 
permitting the Pacient to eate any other 
meate. And if at Sea, Rice only sodden 
in water, rather then any thing else 
vsuall there, vntill the infirmitie is perfectly 
asswaged. 
 
[}THE ERIZIPILA.}] 
 
THe Erizipila is a Disease 
very much raigning in 
those Countries, the rather 
proceeding of the 
vnholesome aires and vapours, 
that hot Climates doo yeelde, 
whereof many people doo perish. And 
[^f.C2v^] 
it is found incurable, except it be preuented 
by Medicines, presently ministred to 
the Pacients vexed therewith. 
 
[}To know the Erizipila.}] 
 
HE that hath the Erizipila, will bee 
swolne in the face, or some part of 
him, and it will be of yellow colour mixt 
with red. And when it is thrust with the 
finger, there will remaine a signe or dint 
of the same: and then by degrees it will 
fill againe to the former proportion. 
And it speedily infecteth the inwarde 
parts, because such swellings comes sooner 
to perfection in hot places, then in 
temperate Countries. And therefore the 
diseased thereof, must bee immediatlie 
prouided of remedie. 
 
[}To cure the Erizipila.}] 
 
SOme sauage people haue first found 
perfectly to cure this Erizipila, although 
[^f.C3r^] 
it is the Spanish name of the Maladie; 
by brusing so much Tobaco, as will 
yeeld foure spoonfuls of iuyce, and to 
drinke it presently after they are infected 
therewith. And to launce the places 
swolne; thereunto putting Casada wet, 
and made in paste. Continuing in colde 
places and shadie, neere Riuers: and not 
to trauell or labour, vntill they are recouered. 
But the Spanyards in India, recouer 
themselues by taking the same iuyce 
of Tobaco, and setting so many Uentoses 
vpon the swolne places, as they can containe, 
scarrifying them, and drawing out 
the corrupted Humour so congealed. 
And doing the like in two or three other 
parts of the bodie, where the Disease 
doth not appeare. 
 
The iuice of Tobaco, is very excellent to 
expell Poyson, and is the ordinarie remedie 
vsed by the Indians, and many other sauage 
people, when they are poysoned, and bit with 
Scorpions, or other venemous creatures. But 
[^f.C3v^] 
they presently make some kinde of incision, 
where they are bit or stung, and wash it with 
the iuyce of Tobaco: then applying the same 
brused thereunto, two or three dayes, they 
heale it vp with dried Tobaco. 
 
[}THE TIN~OSO.}] 
 
THe Tin~oso, or Sceruey is an 
infecting Disease, sufficientlie 
knowne vnto Seafaring men: 
who by putrified meates, and corrupted 
drinkes, eating Bisket flowrie, or foule 
crusted, wearing wet apparell (especially 
sleeping in it) and slothfull demeanour, 
or by grosse humours contained 
in their bodies, obtaine the same. 
 
[}To know the Scuruey.}] 
 
ALthough most Chirurgions, and 
chiefly those that frequent the Sea, 
doo vnderstand how to discerne when 
their Pacients haue the Scuruey; because 
[^f.C4r^] 
it is so ordinary at Sea, as it hath been seldome 
seene, any Ship or Pinnice, to bee 
foure moneths vpon any Voyage, to any 
part of the world, not ariuing where 
they haue been supplied and relieued 
with the benefits of the Land: but some 
of the Companie haue had this Disease. 
Yet it is not impertinent here to insert 
the signes thereof: the rather, because I 
haue known some so destitute of knowledge, 
to discerne and cure the same, as 
the losse of men lost thereby, hath diuerted 
determined purposes to proceed on 
Voyages: and others to perish, when 
they returned out of hot Regions into 
cold Climates, where they haue had the 
lineaments of their bodies, that with 
heate are nimble and tractable to euerie 
motion of the spirits, dulled and benummed 
with colde: which is a token that 
this disease is engendring in their ioints: 
and soonest appeares by swelling of 
their anckles and knees, and blacknes of 
their gummes, or loosenes of their teeth, 
[^f.C4v^] 
which will sometimes come forth, when 
there is not redresse ministred in season. 
 
[}Preseruatiues against 
the Scuruey.}] 
 
TO preserue men from the Scuruie, 
there must be care to prepare those 
things before rehearsed, well conditioned: 
the badnes whereof doth partlie 
breede the inconuenience. And men 
themselues must haue a discreet endeuour 
to auoid their owne ruine, by vsing 
exercise of their bodies. And such as are 
exempted from being commanded to 
doo labour, to hang by the armes twise 
or thrice euery day. And not to haue 
scarcitie of drinke in hot Climates: and 
comming into the cold, to be daily relieued 
with Aqua vitæ, or wine. Also it is a 
certaine and assured medicine against 
this Disease, to haue such quantitie of 
Beere brewed with Graynes and Long 
pepper, as in the morning twise euerie 
[^f.D1r^] 
week there may be giue~ a good draught 
to a man, proportioning three quarters 
of a pound of Graines, and three quarters 
of a pound of Pepper to a hogshead 
of Beere. But white Wine or Syder, boyled 
and brewed with Graynes and Long 
pepper, in like quantitie, is very singular 
good. And it is not fit to suffer the gums 
to abound with flesh: and therfore sometimes 
let them bleede, and cleere them 
with strong Vineger. 
 
[}To cure the Scuruey.}] 
 
THe partie that hath the Scuruey setled 
in his mouth, must haue the corrupted 
and black flesh take~ away, washing 
his mouth with strong Vineger 
wherein Graines and Long pepper haue 
been infused and brewed: and giue him 
the drinke daily that is before prescribed. 
And aswell such as haue it in their 
mouthes, as those that are swolne in their 
limmes, must haue some meete Purgation 
[^f.D1v^] 
presently. But those so swolne or 
stiffe (for so some will bee without swelling) 
to scarifie the parts infected, and to 
applie thereunto a Pultis or Cataplasme 
of Barley meale, more hot then the Pacient 
will willingly suffer it. So doing euerie 
morning, permit him not to rest two 
houres after, although hee being nummed 
or faint, be supported to walke: and 
not to suffer him to eate any salt meates, 
if other may be had. 
 
My selfe hauing 80. men, 800. leagues 
forth of England, sicke of the Scuruey, I 
caused this meanes of scarifying to be vsed, 
and to the places scarified, Pulteses (being 
destitute of the helpes mentioned) to bee applied 
of Bisket, beaten in a morter, and sodden 
in water: which with the comfort of some 
fresh meates (obtained) recouered them all, 
except one person, and they arriued in England 
perfectly sound. 
 
[^f.D2r^] 
[}Conclusion.}] 
 
LEt no man boast of beautie, strength, or youth: 
For like to flowres we bud, we spread, we fade: 
Nothing is certaine, but the certaine truth, 
To day a man, to morrow but a shade. 
His last apparell, cut out with a spade, 
Of Natures coursest stuffe (I meane) her molde, 
Must shrowd the corps, that liuing shone in golde. 
 
Quando tengas, mas fortuna, 
mira que es, como la Luna.
