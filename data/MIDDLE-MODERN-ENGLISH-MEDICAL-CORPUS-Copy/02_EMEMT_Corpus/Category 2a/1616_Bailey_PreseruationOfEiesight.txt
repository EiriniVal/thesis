[}A breefe Treatise concerning 
the preseruation of 
the eye sight.}] 
 
THe preseruation of 
the sight doth consist, 
partly in good 
order of diet, partly 
in vse of Medicines. 
 
Concerning diet: 
[/1./] 
some things hurtfull 
are to be eschued, and some things 
comfortable to the sight are to be vsed: 
wherefore they, which may chose their 
habitations, in this respect, may make election 
of aire cleare, [/2./] declining to moderate 
heate and drynesse: cold and moyst 
aire, and thicke, misty, and rainy weather is 
hurtfull: it is best therefore to abide in dry 
places, from moory, marish and watrish 
grounds and specially to prouide, that the 
site of the dwelling be not betweene the 
[^p.2^] 
[/3./] 
wet places and the sun: Southerne windes 
[/4./] 
doe hurt the sight: so doe low roomes: 
[/5./] 
places full of dust and smoakie are noysome. 
 
[/6./] 
Meates are best which are easie to be 
digested, and which doe not stay long in 
the stomacke: amongest such a young 
Henne is greatly commended: so is Partridge 
and Pheasant: Rasis praiseth the 
young starne, and the quaile: so doe all 
writers the Doue both tame and wyld, but 
chiefly the wild Doue, which (as Zoar 
writeth) hath especiall vertue against the 
weakenesse of the sight, which commeth 
by defect of spirites, and the rather, if the 
same be sod with rape rootes, and turnep 
rootes: for it is accorded by all writers, 
that the turnep hath great faculty to doe 
good to the eies, and to preserue the sight. 
Grosse and slimy meates, and all waterfoule 
are dispraised. Of small birdes, the 
martin, the swallow, the iay and pie, the 
witwall, the specht are noted very hurtfull 
to the sight: and albeit these birds 
are seldome, or not at all vsed of the better 
sort, yet common people happily may 
be compelled to eate them. No fish is accompted 
[/7./] 
good: yet some fishes, which doe 
[^p.3^] 
skoure in grauely-places, being sauery sodden 
with white wine, fenel, eiebright, sage, 
perslie, &c. may at some times be eaten: and 
so a little salt-fish moderately taken doth 
no great harme. Flesh sodden with fenell, 
[/8./] 
eiebright, mintes, sage, &c. is reputed best, 
next are roasted meates; flesh fried with 
butter or oyle is to be reiected, th' entrals, 
[/9./] 
and feete of beasts are not so good, nor the 
braines for the most part, yet the braines of 
[/10./] 
an hare, of a cony, and of pigeons, are said 
to quicken the sight. 
 
Milke and all things made thereof are 
[/11./] 
found by experience to induce dimnesse of 
sight: reare rosted, reare sodden, or poched 
egges are holesome, especially eaten with 
[/12./] 
the powder of eiebright: fryed egges and 
hard are blamed. 
 
[/13./] 
Of sauces, veriuce, vinigar of wine, and 
the iuce of limonds, are accompted best; 
Pomgranats, not so good. 
 
Of spices, cinnamon is commended by 
[/14./] 
Auicenna, as speciall good fo the webbe of 
the eie, and for dimnesse of the sight: so is 
saffron; ginger, both inwardly taken, and 
outwardly applyed, doth singularly cleare 
the sight: cloues, mace, and nutmegs, and 
all three kindes of peppers, may be vsed. 
[^p.4^] 
[/15./] 
Suger is conuenient to condite things, but 
[/16./] 
hony is better: no oyle is good, saue pile 
[/17./] 
oliue called sallet oile, and that is better 
[/18./] 
then butter. 
 
[/19./] 
Albeit few raw hearbes in common vse 
for sallets are commended, except fenell, 
eie-bright, young sage, terragone, which 
are very good: yet these are to be avoided 
as most hurtfull, namely lettis, coleworts, 
cabbages, beets, spinage, purslane, buddes 
of dill, garlike, chibbols, onions, skallions, 
[/20./] 
&c. Capers may be eaten: not 
[/21./] 
 so good: radish rootes, persnep rootes, are 
[/22./] 
greatly dispraised: carrot rootes, the buds 
[/23./] 
of asperage may be eaten, but the turnup 
or rape roote, and the nauew roote are aboue 
all other noted for excellencie to 
preserue the sight, and to that purpose many 
doe preserue with sugar these rootes and 
eate them as sucket. 
 
[/24./] 
The most kindes of fruits are hurtfull to 
[/25./] 
the sight: yet peares and the better kindes 
[/26./] 
of apples, may be eaten with the pouder 
of eiebright, or with fenell seeds thinly incrusted 
[/27./] 
with fine sugar: figs are very good, 
not onely for the sight, but also to open, 
s_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]oure, and to clense the brest, liuer, stomacke 
[/28./] 
and kidneies: so are raisons, which 
[^p.5^] 
haue a speciall property to strengthen the 
[/29./] 
liuer: nuts are very evil, for that they doe fill 
the head: the walnut more tollerable then 
the hasell nut, chestnuts are very windie, 
better friends for Uenus, then for the eies: 
[/30./] 
dates are not commended, nor mulberies. 
 
[/31./] 
Confectes made with fine sugar and thinly 
incrusted about with turnep seedes, and 
navew seeds, fenill seeds, anise seeds almonds, 
pine aple kernels, ginger, cinamon, 
the powder of eiebright, &c. are reputed as 
very good meanes to continue the sight: 
likewise in the preseruation of the sight, amongst 
other things, such drinkes, as are in 
[/32./] 
common vse and accustomed, are to be allowed: 
therefore he that hath vsed to drink 
[/33./] 
beere, may not forsake the same and so of 
ale. 
 
And in this respect it is not amis at meate 
[/34./] 
to drinke wine, for them which haue beene 
accustomed to the same: although wine in 
some affectes of the eies is forbidden, yet 
to preserue the sight, wine is not inconuenient, 
for the vapours of wine are drying, 
cleare abstersiue, and so doe consume and 
extenuate grosse and thick humours, so it 
be moderately taken. In this place I doe 
greatly commend their councels, which do 
[^p.6^] 
[/35./] 
prepare medicinable drinks with eiebright, 
and other things comfortable for the sight, 
to be vsed in the morning, and at meates, if 
the patient can well endure so to drinke 
the same: our authors herein are very ingenious, 
some addressing drinkes with one 
thing, and some with another. 
 
[/36./] 
The simplest and most written of, is 
with the herbe called of the Arabians 
Adhill, in Latine Euphragia, in English 
Eie-bright, of whose miraculous vertues in 
[/37./] 
preseruation of the sight, Arnoldus de villa 
noua hath written in these words: Eiebright 
is good any way taken, either with 
meate, drinke or medicine, greene and dry, 
[/38./] 
against all impediments of the sight, whereby 
the clearenes of the same may be obscured. 
And hee writeth thus of wine made 
[/39./] 
with Eiebright, which hee calleth Uinum 
euphragiatum. This wine (saith he) is made 
by putting the herbe in the muste or new 
wine, vntill the same wine be come cleare 
to be drunke. By the vse of this wine, old 
mens sights are made young, it taketh away 
the impediments of the sight in all 
men of all ages, especiasly in fat men, and 
such which doe abound with phlegme. 
 
One (saith he) which was blind, and did 
[^p.7^] 
see nothing in long time, by vsing this wine 
one yeare, was restored to his sight. The 
herbe is hot and drie, and hath by propertie 
of substance to remoue affectes of the 
[/40./] 
sight. And so the powder of the herbe taken 
in an egge, or drunken in wine, doth 
wonderfully performe the same. And 
there are yet aliue (saith hee) witnesses of 
good credit, which haue made proofe 
heereof in themselues, which could not 
reade without spectacles. but by vse hereof 
haue recouered their sight to reade small 
letters. And so Arnoldus concludeth, that 
nothing to doe good to the sight, is to be 
compared with wine made with eiebright. 
If the wine be too strong, he counselleth 
to allay the same with fennell water; and to 
that intention. you may also adde sugar. 
 
In countries which for their common 
drinkes do vse wine and water, they alway 
do mingle things for the sight in wine and 
not in water: for wine in truth is a fitter liquor 
to receiue the qualities and to carry 
the same to the eyes, then water: which 
thinges they do put in the muste, and so let 
it stand, vntill the wine be ripe, and ready 
to be drunken, and so do vse it. 
 
Notwithstanding in other Countries 
[^p.8^] 
[/41./] 
which haue other vsuall drinkes, the same 
things may be put in their common drinks, 
So some haue put them in ale, some in 
beere and some in meade, and no doubt 
but all these meanes are very good according 
to the vsage and disposition of the 
partie. So euen in this our Country they 
which either by vse or by constitution of 
body, may wel beare the drinking of wine, 
may well compound the same with things 
good for the sight others of hot complexions 
and drie, not greatly accustomed to 
wine, may of ale, beere, and meade make 
such drinkes, because in the North countries, 
ale and beere are the vsuall and common 
drinkes, and in some places, meade also 
is much vsed: therefore in mine opinion 
it is conuenient for most men, to make 
these drinkes with ale, beere, and meade, 
rather then with wine: and meade assuredly 
is a very conuenient thing for them 
which can well away with hony. 
 
[/42./] 
Touching the direction of those which 
haue bin accustomed to drinke wine, I do 
nothing doubt, but that they may without 
offence beare such drinks for the sight 
compounded with wine to take a draught 
in the morning, especially if the allay the 
[^p.9^] 
same with the distilled water of fenell, according 
to Arnoldus counsell. And for this 
purpose, choyse may bee made of very 
good white wine, and the thinges may bee 
mingled in the countries where the wine 
doth growe, notwithstanding in that our 
most vsed drinke with meat is ale, or beere, 
these are very conuenient to receiue these 
[/43./] 
thinges for the sight, and absolutely better 
then wine, if yee like to drinke the same 
with meate: as our anthors doe counsell. 
[/44./] 
Which ale I thinke better to be made with 
grout according to the old order of brewing. 
And so the thinges for the sight may 
be sodden in the grout, or other way put 
[/45./] 
in the drinke, when it is newly clensed, & 
put into the vessell in which it is tunned 
to be kept that in the working of the drink 
in the vessel, the vertues and qualities of 
the thinges may be drawne and receiued 
into the same. When these thinges are 
compounded in meade, then the same are 
[/46./] 
sodden with the honie, in such order as other 
herbes are sodden, when they make 
methegline. 
 
I thinke it best to begin with the simplest 
order to compound ale or beere to 
each mans best liking with eiebright only, 
[^p.10^] 
[/47./] 
taking to euery gallon of the drink a great 
handfull of the herbe, and bind it together, 
or put it in raw and thinne tinsell of silke, 
and so tie the same by a string to the tap of 
the vessell, that the herbe may hang in the 
middest of the drinke, not too low in the 
ground, neither to high in the barme, being 
put into the drinke when it is newlie 
clensed: let all worke togither vntill the 
drinke be cleare and ripe, to be drunken 
according to the common vse, and then ye 
may drinke of it at pleasure in the morning 
fasting, and at meate also if you will, and 
can well like thereof; and most men may 
like to drinke it, because this herbe doeth 
yeeld no vngratefull taste, but rather 
with a pleasant sapour doth commend 
the drinke. It were not amisse, to avoide 
windines, to euery handfull of the herbe 
[/48./] 
to adde two drammes of fenell seeds, well 
dusted, and a little bruised. As I doe put this 
for more proportion to beginne with-all, 
that the stomacke be not at the first offended 
with the strangenesse: So after a time, 
yee may increase the quantitie, and put to 
euery gallon of the drinke, two handfuls 
of the herbe, wherein yee may best be directed 
by the taste, that the herbe shall 
[^p.11^] 
yeeld into the drinke. In the winter season 
[/49./] 
yee may also adde some spices, as ginger, 
whole mace, a few cloues, nutmegs, 
cinnamon, and make as it were bragget 
ale: which drinke, besides that it dtoh preserue 
and cleere the sight, will also helpe 
digestion, clense and cut phlegme, and 
breake winde. 
 
I can witnes, that many by this simple 
[/50./] 
composition of eiebright and fenell seeds, 
haue found great good for their sight, not 
onely to continue in good estate, but also 
that some haue found remedie against the 
dimnes and other impediments, growing in 
their sight. In truth once I met an old man 
in Shropshire, called M. Hoorde, aboue the 
age of 84. yeares, who had at that time perfit 
sight, and did read small letters very well 
without spectacles: hee told me that about 
the age of 40. yeares, finding his sight 
to decay, he did vse Eiebright in ale for his 
drinke, and did also eate the powder thereof 
in an egge three daies in a weeke, being 
so taught of his father, who by the like 
order continued his sight in good integrity 
to a very long age. I haue heard the same 
confirmed by many old men. Rowland Sherlooke 
an Irish man, Phisition to Queene 
[^p.12^] 
Marie, did affirme for truth, that a Bishop 
in Ireland perceiuing his sight to wax 
dimme, about his age of fifty yeare, by the 
vse of eiebright take~ in powder in an egge, 
did liue to the age of 80 yeares, with good 
integrity of sight. 
 
[/51./] 
VVe do reade of many drinkes to preserue 
the sight, compounded not of eiebright 
onely, but many moe thinges added: 
so some put to it sage, some veruaine, 
some celendine, and fennell seedes, anise 
seeds, & the forenamed spices: others elcampane 
rootes, iris galengale, & cubebs, 
and in truth all these are greatly commended 
to preserue the sight, and may very 
aptly be put in drinkes for the sight: notwithstanding, 
for that we are now to deliuer 
a drinke for the sight, which may bee 
pleasing, and alowed with meates, mine 
opinion is, that the same ought to be made 
as simple as may be. For if Gallen in his 6. 
booke de sanitate tuenda, doth preferre the 
composition of the medicine termed diatrion 
piperio~, which hath fewest simples, because 
[/52./] 
(as he writeth) that is soonest & with 
lesse trouble to nature digested: surely the 
drinkes for the sight, which are compounded 
of fewest thinges, are most to bee 
[^p.13^] 
commended, especially when we meane to 
vse the same with meate, as all our authors 
do cou~sell vs. Wherefore, for my part at this 
time, I will onely aduise to haue for vse, either 
wine, or ale, or beere, according to 
each mans best liking, made as it is before 
prescribed with eiebright and fenell seeds, 
and to drinke of the same in the morning, 
or if it so like with meat, as other drinke. 
 
It is holded better to drinke oft and small 
[/53./] 
draughts at meat, then seldome and great 
draughts; for so meat and drinke will better 
mingle, and the meat will lesse swimme 
in the stomake, which giueth cause of many 
[/54./] 
vapours to the head. It is affirmed not 
good to begin the meale with drinke, but 
to eat somewhat before you drinke. 
 
When you drinke wine if you meane to 
[/55./] 
alay the same with water, it is best to mingle 
to the wine fennell water, or eiebright 
water, and Alontagnana doth counsell to 
doe the same some reasonable time before 
you do drinke, and not presently when you 
drinke, as commonly men doe. 
 
Bread in our intention is to be made of 
[/56./] 
fine flower of chosen wheat, alway leuened 
and salted somewhat more then common 
bread, well wrought, throughly baked, 
[^p.14^] 
not new nor old, of about a day or two 
[/57./] 
daies old. Vnleuened bread is not accompted 
good: and the bread is better, if fenell 
seeds be wrought with the past; to which 
purpose some do cause cakes to be made of 
some portion of the dowgh, in which they 
knead the powder of fenell seeds, and the 
powder of eiebright, and doe eate them in 
the morning, and after drink the eiebright 
drinke, and make that a breakfast. 
 
As generally in the preseruation of 
[/58./] 
health: so especially to continue the sight, 
it is conuenient that the body be obedient, 
and doe his office for euacuation accordingly: 
and if nature herein be slack, it 
may be procured with brothes made of 
loose herbes, as mallowes, violet leaues, 
mercury, groundsell, great raisons the stones 
taken out, damaske pruines and currants: 
and if neede be of more medicinall things, 
surely the same must be gentle: for as strong 
medicines, which make agitation of humors 
are not good to be vsed for this intention: 
so gentle medicines taken in due 
time, doe great good to the sight: which I 
doe leaue to the appointment and direction 
of a learned Phisition. Of all manner of 
euacuation, these which are done by vomiting 
[^p.15^] 
are most hurtfull: so are fluxes of 
blood by the nose. And as belkes doe ease 
the stomacke, so much belking giueth occasion 
that fumes doe arise to the fore-part 
of the head, whereby the sight may be harmed. 
 
Nothing is more hurtfull to health then 
[/59./] 
fulnes. And he that will continue his sight 
good, must be carefull of ouer-plentifull 
feeding, and therefore must end his meales 
with appetite: and neuer lay gorge vpon 
gorge, but so feede, that the former meate 
may be concocted, before hee doe eate 
againe. It is best to make light suppers, and 
some-what timely. As modest vse of Uenus 
[/60./] 
perfourmed in the feare of God in due 
time, when the meate in the stomacke is 
digested, and nature is desirous to be disburdened, 
is to be allowed: so immoderate 
and vnseasonable vse thereof, doth of all 
things most hurt the sight, and soonest induce 
blindnes: ouer-much watching is not 
good: very long sleepes are more hurtfull: 
[/61./] 
the meane sleeps of about vij. houres, are 
best: yet better to abridge the sleepe and to 
inlarge watching, then contrariwise: sleepe 
taken in the night is best, as most naturall, 
when externall aire doth not distract natures 
[^p.16^] 
motion, and all externall things concurre 
to helpe sleepe, therefore the moe 
houres a man doth borrow of the day for 
sleepe, the worser. It is not good especia _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ly 
to this our purpose, to sleepe immediatly 
after meate: for two houres at the least 
ought to be put betweene meate and sleep. 
Best to begin sleep vpon the right side, and 
then to turne on the left side: to sleepe vpright 
vpon the backe is naught generally: 
[/62./] 
to turne vpon the face worser for the sight. 
Care must be had that you sleepe not in a 
chamber, or any place in which the Moone 
doth shine. 
 
[/63./] 
Exercises are needfull: the same best, after 
the belly hath done his office, that the 
excrements are avoided: otherwise by exercise 
vapours are stirred, and doe ascend 
[/64./] 
more plentifully to the head. All exercises 
must be done fasting, and none after meate. 
And I wish you might after meate for beare 
writing by the space of three houres: but 
if your course of life and calling will not so 
permit you, you may herein follow Montagnana 
his counseil, to write either standing 
vpright, or a little leaning and resting 
your head vpon your right or left cheeke: 
in no case to write bowing your selfe forward, 
[^p.17^] 
and holding downe the head. When 
opportunity and time will serue, frictions 
[/65./] 
with a rough linnen cloth are very good, 
which are to be performed thus: first to 
rub the feete, the legges, then the thighes, 
the hips, the buttockes, ascending to the 
shoulders and necke with soft and long 
rubbings, euen vntill the partes begin to 
wax red. Amongst orders to remooue the 
weakenes of the sight, Auicenna writeth 
that the combing of the head is not of least 
[/66./] 
force, which ought to be done euery morning 
fasting backwardes against the haire 
for it draweth the vapours out of the head, 
and remoueth them from the sight. 
 
[/67./] 
Mirth, ioy, and pleasantnes of the minde 
is good: a little anger doth not hurt: immoderate 
sorrow, fearefulnes, and all vehement 
affections are forbidden in all affects, 
but in this our case chiefly, as most hurtfull 
to the sight. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[}To preserue the sight by Medicines.}] 
 
THE order to preserue the 
sight by medicines, doth 
consist of things outwardly 
applied, & inwardly taken. 
[/68./] 
Amongest outward medicines 
to preserue the sight, 
it is accounted a great secret, to smel much 
to marierum. So these things following, are 
[/69./] 
found very much to comfort the sight in 
staying the visible spirits from wasting: videlicet, 
corall, pearle, the stone called Lapis 
[/70./] 
Armenius, spectacles of Christalline or clear 
and pure glasse, greene & sky colours, to dip 
the eies in cold water, to which purpose, 
many haue cups made in the forme of an 
[/71./] 
eie, called eie-cups: & to wash the eies with 
the waters or decoctions of eiebright, roses, 
and veruaine. Some other things are put 
[/72./] 
into the eies to clear the sight, & to remoue 
impediments which do often grow there: 
to which purpose as approued very good 
& without hurt, the iuices & waters of eiebright, 
of fenell, of veruaine, of marigolds, 
of pearlwort are greatly commended. And 
[^p.19^] 
Montagnana doeth mention a certaine 
[/73./] 
kinde of preparation of the iuice of fenell, 
singular good to preserue the sight from 
dimnesse, to take the iuce of fenell in the 
month of Aprill, and to put it in a vessell 
of glasse, with a long and narrow necke, 
and let it stand fifteene daies in the sunne, 
that it may be well dryed, then remoue 
the glasse softly, that you doe not trouble 
the residue, or grounds, and so powre it 
into another vessell: and to euery halfe 
pound of the iuice, put an ounce of chosen 
lignum aloes, beaten into fine powder, and 
[/74./] 
let it stand other fifteene daies in the Sun. 
Then straine it twise through a thick cloth, 
and keepe the clearest in a vessell of glasse 
to your vse: you may drop a little hereof 
into your eies to cleare the sight. And some 
do distill this wood in a stillatory of glasse, 
and put the water thereof into the eies, 
and hold this for a great secret as miraculous 
to preserue the sight. And the same 
Montagnana doeth compound another 
medicine more abstersiue to remedie the 
dimnes of the sight, dissoluing in an ounce 
[/75./] 
of the water of Rosemarie flowers, two 
scruples of Sal gemma very finely powdered, 
and filtered, and counselleth to drop 
[^p.20^] 
the same often into the eies; affirming by 
his experience, that it doeth so mightily 
cleare the sight, that suffusions are thereby 
wonderfully remoued, and especially moistures 
of the eies. 
 
I am heere also in this place for the clensing 
and strenghtning of the eies especially 
to commend vnto you the frequent vse 
of old and cleere white wine, in which 
the Calaminar stone hath beene oftentimes 
extinguished: and likewise the pure liquor 
of good sugar-candy dissolued in the white 
of an egge, being hard rosted and the yolke 
taken out. 
 
[/76./] 
Also our authors do commend the washing 
of the eies with the vrin of a childe, and 
sometimes to drop the same into the eies. 
[/77./] 
And for this purpose also they do commend 
lie made of the ashes of fenell stalkes. Wee 
doe read in all our writers great commendations, 
[/78./] 
of a liquor of the liuer of a goate, 
prepared in manner following. Take the liuer 
of a male goat, not diseased, nor newly 
killed: and after it is well washed, pricke 
it in many places, and fill the same with 
graines of pepper, and infarce the liuer 
with the leaues of fennell and of eiebright, 
then rost it with a soft fire cleare, not smoakie, 
[^p.21^] 
vntill it bee reasonably rosted: and in 
the time of roasting, receiue the liquor 
which doth distill, in a conuenient vessell, 
and apply the same to your vse. 
 
Auicenna in his third fen. third booke 
and fourth treatise, cap. de debilitate visus, 
aboue all other things doth commend the 
medicine called collyrium de fellibus, for that 
[/79./] 
it cleanseth the pores of the eies, cleareth 
and conserueth the spirits, mundifieth the 
moystures or waters of the sight: as you may 
reade in Auicenna in the foresaide place. 
 
[}Inward Medicines.}] 
 
MEdicins to be taken inwardly 
are in number many: but 
I thinke best at this time to 
mention a few, which are easie 
to be had, and as of great 
efficacy most commended: & 
of such the powder following is most simple: 
[/80./] 
yet by experience aproued of such force 
that many, after their sight hath bin decaied, 
haue by the vse of it, receiued againe 
[^p.22^] 
the same perfectly: the powder is thus 
made. 
 
Take of the powder of eiebright foure 
onnces, of mace one ounce, mingle them togither, 
and take thereof the weight of three 
pence before meate. 
 
Montanus in his 92. counsel giueth great 
[/81./] 
praise to a sirup, against the decay of the 
sight through the weakenes and dimnes of 
the same, which he compoundeth thus. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Take of the iuices of fennel, 
of veruaine, 
of roses, 
	of each two ounces. 
The leaues of the herbe eiebright 
of endiue, 
of celendine. 
	of each M. S. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
 
boyle the herbes in two pints of water vntill 
the halfe be spent: then straine it hard, 
and mingle the iuices with the decoction, 
and with sugar according to art make a sirup, 
which is to be kept in a glasse vessell. 
You may take two ounces of this sirup in 
the morning fasting. In windy bodies hee 
maketh the sirup thus, 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Take of fenell seeds, 
of anise seeds. 
	of each iij ounces. 
[^p.23^] 
of the herbs of eiebright 
of veruaine, 
of rose-leaues, 
	of each M. iij. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
of celendine. M. j. 
of rhue. M. j. S. 
 
boile these in water vntill halfe be consumed: 
straine it harde, and with sugar siruppize 
the decoction: both these sirups are 
excellent good to defend the sight from 
dimnesse. 
 
Mesue in his booke called Grabadin, writing 
[/82./] 
of the diseases of the eies, aboue all other 
medicines extolleth an electuary vnder 
the name of Humaine, as hauing noble 
vertues to perserue the eies, and to continue 
the visible spirites in their clearenesse, 
which he compoundeth thus. 
 
Take the herbe called Adhil, that is 
eiebright, ounces, ij. 
fenill seeds, Drams v. 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
mace, 
cubebs, 
cinamom, 
long-peper, 
cloues. 
	of each Dra. j. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
beate all into powder, searse it, then take 
of good hony clarified, lib. j. 
[^p.24^] 
of the iuice of fenill boyled and clarified, 
one ounce, 
of the iuce of Rhue 
of Celendine 
both boiled and clarified, 
of each halfe an ounce. 
 
boyle all to the height of an electuary, and 
then put to it the powders according to art, 
and so reserue it in glasse vessels. You may 
take hereof the quantity of Dra. iij, in wine 
as Mesue writeth: If wine seeme too hot, 
you may allay it with fenill water, or with 
Eiebright water: it must be taken in the 
morning fasting: and you ought to forbeare 
the taking of other things, by the space of 
three houres, and so at night, but then you 
must make a light supper, and sup the more 
timely. 
 
[/83./] 
Where in this little Treatise mention is 
made of distilled waters, I wish the same to 
be artificially done in stillitories of glasse, 
that the qualities of the herbes may remaine 
in the distilled waters. And therefore I 
doe not allow of the common maner of distilling 
in stillitories of lead, by the which 
the watry parts onely are drawne. 
 
[}FINIS.}] 
 
[^p.25^] 
[}A Treatise of the principall 
diseases of the eyes, gathered 
out of Fernelius and Iohn 
Riolamus Doctors 
of Phisicke}] 
 
AS the Eyes are of a delicate 
and soft nature, so ar they by 
the most light occasion offended, 
as by smoak, by dust, 
and the Sunne beames: so 
the north winde, and vapours rising from 
minerals doe hurt the eyes. But this peculiar 
property the eyes haue, that they congeale 
not because they are of a fiery property, 
and doe consist of an airy fatnes. 
 
The eyes are subiect to euery kinde of 
disease, Simeler, Organical, and commune 
as the similer parts doe labour with euery 
distemprature, with an hot distemprature, 
as often as they are offended with smoake, 
or dust, which offence proceeding from an 
outward cause, is properly called Taraxis, 
rednes of the eyes is more like vnto Phlogosis, 
then Phlegmon because they ar red without 
[^p.26^] 
tumor. A cold distemprature doth dull 
the sight. A moyst doth dilate the pupill: 
A dry distemprature doth either shrinke vp 
the whole eye, or the pupill thereof is dryed 
or extenuated, as it hapneth in extreame 
old age, or by the immoderate vse of venerie. 
From thence Pthisis, and an Atrophia 
hapneth of the eye: I call that Pthisis 
which is an extenuation of the pupill, or apple, 
and becometh more angustior, and 
streyter, and more obscure: but that is an 
Atrophia, when the whole eye is consumed 
for want of nourishment. And as the Instrument 
doth suffer diseases of number, of 
magnitude, of situation and conformation, 
(I say) conformation in the figure, Meatus, 
and Asperitie, for it is a disease in magnitude, 
as often as the eyes are more great, 
and more standing forth then they should, 
for the lesser eyes are best, because the visible 
vertue being coacted and drawne togither 
is greater then when it is dispersed, 
and is least subiect to outward iniuries: from 
whence it doth happen, that those which 
by nature haue small balls or apples of the 
eye, haue their sight most sharpe, I meane 
not those which haue it so by accident, as 
if they be extenuated by immoderate venerie, 
[^p.27^] 
for then thinges seeme to be greater 
then they are: to this may be referred Enchanthis, 
and Rhinas, for they are the contrary 
of the same kinde. Encanthis is an excrescence 
of the same flesh which is in the 
greater Cantho, but Rhinas is when the 
same caruncle being eroded and eaten, 
doth appeare as it were hanging forth. To 
diseases of number, doe appertaine Suffusio, 
which is commonly called the Cataracte, 
which is an humor concreate betweene the 
Cornea, and the Vuea: in like manner, the 
web called Pterigium and Onix or Vngula 
and Hipopion. The web is a nervose membrane, 
which according to diuers men, 
doth proceede from the great corner vnto 
the apple, and sometimes at length doth couer 
the whole eye. Onyx or Vnguis is a Cicatrix 
from some vlcer, which is referred to 
the likenes of a nayle. Hypopion is a certaine 
Pus, collected vnder the Cornea, which 
doth succeed a suppurated inflammation & 
Chemosi, Hyposphagmati bloudy and suggillat 
eyes, such as are when some veine is 
opened, broken. or gnawne, the bloud 
waxeth blewe and liued: 
 
To diseases of Site or situation doth appertaine 
Ecpiesmos, which is, when the whole 
[^p.28^] 
ball hangeth forth, which hapneth by the 
Muscles relaxed, which muscles do obuolue 
the opticke nerue, which disease may be called 
Prolapsus oculi, although Paulus doth 
call it Proptosin, when the Cornea being eroded 
or eaten, the Vuea doth hang forth, of 
which Proptoseos there are diuers names, 
for first when the vuea doth hang forth, because 
it appeareth like vnto the head of a 
Flie, it is called Myocephalos, but when it 
doth increase more, and doth represent Acinum 
vuæ, it is called Staphiloma, when it 
doth more increase, and the eye is starke 
blinde and hath the likenes of the head of 
a nayle, it is called Clauus, but either affect 
is Morbus in situ, but the first is of the whole 
eye, the latter of one onely part, that is of 
the vuea. Diseases of conformation are, 
when the naturall figure of the eye is peruerted, 
as in Strabismo or conuulsion, Midriasei 
or dilatation of the ball: also diseases 
in Uia, as a sodaine obstruction of the Opticke 
nerue, which is called Hamarosis. The 
Sicke seeth nothing at all, when notwithstanding 
no cause appeareth in the eye, the 
tunicles of the eyes ought to be light, terse, 
and fayre are sometimes exasperated with 
an inward and outward cause, as with 
smoake and dust. 
[^p.29^] 
The eyes do suffer most often common diseases, 
as v_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]cers, and tumors against nature, 
first phlegmon, which is called Opthalmia, 
that is knowne by tumor, inflamation, rednes 
and paine. 
 
The vlcers do manifest themselues by 
itch, by paine and Staines, but not also the 
Adnata, but also the Cornea is sometimes 
vlcered, and whether it bee vlcered, wee 
may easily know by this signe: There doth 
appeare a white spot in the black of the 
eye, with the signes aforesaid: and when 
the Coniunctiua is vlcered there doth appeare 
as it were a red spot in the white of 
the eye: But first, I will set downe the manner 
of curing of those diseases, and then I 
will speak of the Symptoms. 
 
The precept of Plato in Charmide is familiar 
with Galen. Euen as it is in vaine to 
cure the diseases of the head without consideration 
bee first had of the whole, so 
rashly to prescribe remedies to the eyes, 
except we first consider of the head, where 
is the originall both of the eyes and the 
fountaine of all diseases which come by 
defluxion. 
 
Therefore first of all the body is to bee 
purged with pillulis lucis maioribus in a cold 
[^p.30^] 
cause, and in an hot cause, with pil. lucis 
minoribus, or with Sena and Agarick 
which shall bee boyled in a decoction, or 
with the distilled waters of Fenel and Eyebright, 
with which vehicles the purgatiue 
vertue is carried to the eyes: and consider 
that the Agarik doth especially profit the 
braine, and the Senna the eyes. 
 
The opening of a veine in hot diseases 
is profitable, but not in cold, yet the common 
people do hold an opinion that bloudletting 
doth weaken the sight, for it draweth 
the animall spirits and so doth weaken 
their force, because the vapour of bloud or 
the naturall spirit is the matter of the vitall 
spirit, as heere of the animall: for the eyes 
ought to be fiery and full Animall Spirit. 
 
Masticatoriæ without doubt, doe profit 
to the deriuation of the humor from the 
braine, but your errhinae are hurtfull, especially 
the stronger sort, because they draw 
to the part affected, for there is great affinity 
of the nostrils with the eyes: there is 
also a manifest foramen, from the eye into 
the nostrill, whose opercle or couer is a litle 
lacrimall flesh. But some man may say Ætius 
doth prescribe errhina: I answer those 
[^p.31^] 
are the lighter sort, neither is the disease as 
yet confirmed, but now beeing confirmed 
and the humor fixed and not flowing, Cupping 
glasses adplied to the shoulders doth 
pluck back the fluxe from the eyes, euen as 
a Seton, and Cautier, in Inio Iohn de Uigo 
doth apply behind the eares bloudsuckers 
and Uesicatorium, as 
 
[^Beginning of a list in two columns.^] 
Vesicatorium. 
[^A column change.^] 
Recip. Fermenti acris one ounce. 
Cantharidum et Seminis Synapi, 
one dramme. 
[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
Mixe them for a Uesicatorium. 
 
There Fernelius willeth to apply a cautier, 
and doth giue a reason that from thence a 
branch from the iugular vaine springeth 
and doth runne through to the Optick 
Nerues. 
 
As often as the veines of the forehead 
do swell, they shew the fluxe to bee externall 
and the tumor to descend from the 
pericoranium from whence springeth the 
coniunctiua, which fluxe is profitably stayed 
with some adstringent frontall, such as in 
this maner may be prepared. 
 
Recip. Emplast. contra rupturam desiccatiui 
rubri an, one ounce. 
 
Malax them with oyle of myrtles or roses, 
and spred it vppon lynnen and make a 
[^p.32^] 
frontall, which apply all ouer the forehead: 
or, 
 
Recep. Farinæ volatilis an ounce & a halfe. 
boli armeni et Sanguinis Draconis 
ana. two drammes. 
 
Worke them well together with the 
white of egges and oyle of roses, and make 
a frontall as before. Also topicall meanes 
applyed to the head are not to bee neglected. 
 
For this is a generall precept, as often 
as diseases come by defluxion. We must not 
onely respect that part that is offended but 
also that part that sends it Beside a thinne 
humor is to bee ingrost and made thicker, 
and the laxe wayes are to be made straiter: 
this last prescribed frontall is most excellent, 
but first cephalicall thinges and such as 
respect the head must be remembred. 
 
The vse of Eyebright wine doth confirme 
and strengthen weak and ill affected 
eyes or the powder of Eyebright as, 
 
Recep. Euprasiæ, 
Feniculi dulc. ana one ounce. 
Cum duplo Saccharo, take of it after 
meales or, 
 
Recep. Coriandripræparat. one ounce. 
Euphrasiæ et feniculi an. halfe an ounce. 
[^p.33^] 
Cinamomi. one dramme. 
Macis. two scruples. 
 
With the double weight of Sugar make 
a powder to be taken out of a spoone after 
meales, if you please you may boyle the 
iuyces of Fenel and Eyebright with hony 
and make a confection: of which take 
morning and euening the quantity of a 
Walnut. 
 
For generall thinges outwardly to bee 
applyed, I will prescribe two Colliriums, the 
one in hot diseases to be prescribed in the 
beginning of the fluxe, that it may bee repelled, 
the other in the state and declination 
of hot diseases, and in cold also, they 
may at all times be vsed, the first Colirium 
shall be after this manner. 
 
Recip. Muccaginis Semi. Psylii. 
et Cydoniorum, extractæ in aqua Rosarum 
vel plantaginis, an. halfe an 
ounce with two ounces. 
 
Of the same water make a liquid Colirium: 
it is commonly made with the white of 
a new laid egge, being wrought together 
with Rosewater or Plantain water: a Colirium 
to resolue is made in this manner. 
 
Recip. Muccaginis fænugreci extracted 
with Eyebright water or Fenel water an. 
[^p.34^] 
one ounce make a Colirium, or with two 
ounces of the same water make a Collirium 
liquiaum: a litle of the Muscilage is to bee 
prescribed because it doth quickly grow 
sower. 
 
And now I aske whether your Colliria 
are to bee distilled into the eyes as hot as 
may be suffered? as it liketh Scribonius: or 
cold as it pleaseth Mesue, or luke warme 
according to Galen: But in my opinion 
they are to be instilled luke warme, vnlesse 
the affect do require some other thing, for 
in eyes that be exceedingly inflamed and 
burning, wee drop it in cold; but in very 
cold affects wee droppe it in very warme, 
otherwise meanely warme doth alwaies 
serue the turne. 
 
Now to proceed to cure those diseases 
whereof wee haue already spoken: euery 
distemperature is cured by his contrary: as 
eyes that bee inflamed and ouer-hot, shall 
be cooled with the dayly washing of them 
with cold thinges, or with the waters of 
Roses and Plantaine: but if the distemperature 
be cold, we warme the eyes with putting 
in the waters of Eyebright, Fennell, 
Rue, Celendine, washing them often therewith: 
if the eyes bee ouer-moist wee dry 
[^p.35^] 
them if wee macerat tutia in those waters, 
as for example. 
 
Recip. Tutiæ one dram. 
 
Infuse it in eyebright water two ounces, 
make a Collirium, if the eyes be ouer dry we 
humect them by instilling womans milk, or 
with a fotus of mallowes, holy hocks and 
violets: But if some matter be ioyned with 
the distemperature, let it bee resolued with 
a Collirium of the Muscilage of Fenugreeke 
extracted in the aforesaid waters; or wash 
the eyes with the decoction of Fenugreeke, 
with a sponge, or boyle a bag being filled 
with Fenugreeke in water, and apply the 
bagge to the eye warme: hitherto we haue 
spoken of the Similer disease, now we will 
speake of organicall, and first of diseases of 
magnitude. 
 
If the eyes shall be greater or lesser then 
they should be from their first conformation, 
all remedies are vnprofitable: if they 
happen so by accident, as by some fluxe 
from the braine, all the body is often to be 
purged, the moist eyes are to be dryed, we 
must looke to the head that is ouer-moist 
with Cephalicall thinges. Also Cautiers 
must be applyed to dry vp the offending 
humor: we must apply for Topicall, linnen 
[^p.36^] 
dipt in the water of Rue, Celendine, or 
Eyebright, and the infusion of Tutia, or 
the bagge filled with Fenugreeke, or of 
the same Hydroticall Decoction of the infusion 
of Tutia make a Cillirium. 
 
Encanthis groweth whiles the bloud 
doth more abundantly flow to the caruncle 
for nourishment, which being turned into 
the same substance groweth greater then 
it ought to doe: sometimes it is so great 
that it hindreth the eye lids to be shut: it 
is burnt with gold, or els with a burning 
iron, or els cut off, or when it doth surmount 
it is bound with a thread, after it is 
softly bound vp, and after being destitute 
of nourishment, the excrescence doth fall away 
of its owne accord. Our ancient Phisitions 
called this kind of remedy Anabranchismon, 
if the sick bee of a delicate 
constitution and shall refuse the Chirurgery, 
let the ex_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rescence be eaten away with 
burnt Alum or with oyle of vitriol: but it 
must be diligently corrected with rosewater 
or milke, for the exquisite sense of the 
part. In the meane time while these things 
are a doing, wee must defend the eye 
with some defensure to auoid the offence 
of a fluxe. Rhyas doth oftentimes succeed 
[^p.37^] 
Epiphora if the Caruncle be plainely eaten 
it admitteth no cure: but if some part bee 
onely eaten, the flesh may bee regenerated 
by applying incarnatiuss as tutia, aloes. 
thus, or infuse the same in succo granatorum, 
and being strained instill it by drop meale 
into the greater corner of the eye. But perhaps 
you will say wil you mixe adstringents 
with your incarnatiues, such as is the iuyce 
of Pomegranets? which is altogether forbidden 
by Galen: least the dry excrement 
should be retained in the part. But hitherto 
of diseases of magnitude: now follow 
diseases of number. 
 
[}Of the Webbe of the Eye. 
Chap. 3.}] 
 
Pterigium gooweth by the defluxion of 
thick and grosse humors, beeing soft and 
white in the beginnihg. Dioscorides doth 
commend a Collirium of Snailes, they are 
to b_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e burned whole, and the pouder to 
be mixt with honny, the pouder of the cuttle 
bone or the pummis stone may bee also 
mixed with honny as before; If you would 
haue it stronger, mixe a little salt Armoniac. 
but first foment the eye with a decoction 
[^p.38^] 
of Fenugreeke. AEtius vseth to burne 
Plantaine seed, and addeth to the pouder 
mirhe, and also the scales and flowre of 
brasse, but wee should apply no mettals to 
the eyes, except it be first burnt and washed, 
for by the burning and washing, the 
sharpnes and biting quality is remoued, 
and so it doth raise no fluxe, of which our 
cheefest care should bee. Also wee may 
vse oyle of vitriol, but it must bee well corrected 
with milke: but yee shall note that 
a great and inueterate web can be cured 
by no meanes but by Chirurgery: such are 
those that couer the whole ball and black, 
of the eye: webs grosse and thick, black: 
and which do affect the temples, by consent 
are in no hand to bee medled withall. 
 
In like manner if there be suspition of a 
Catarhact beginning, and there be also a 
web that is white and soft, we must abstain 
from thinges eating, because they generate 
and increase the Catarhact. AEtius & 
Celsus doe shew Chirurgery, and especially 
Paulus AEgneta in his 6. booke and 
Cha 28. where he doth shew a double kind 
of cure; the first, that the web be stretched 
once with a thread, & then with a launcet 
[^p.39^] 
to be excoriated; the second, to make a 
passage with a needle that may containe a 
thread or setam (which is the bristle of an 
hogge) and so hanging with the thread the 
web shall be cut with the bristle about the 
apple as it were with a saw, and that which 
doth remaine about the lachrimall, shall 
with the launcet be cut away. 
 
[}Of the Hypopion or matter vnder 
the Cornea. 
Chap. 4.}] 
 
Because that Hypopion followeth to Hyposphagma, 
that is, eyes that are bloudy by 
meanes of some veine being rupted, or open, 
which is also called Aimalops, because 
in this affect all thinges seeme red: therefore 
the bloud-shotten eyes must be quickly 
lookt vnto, least by neglect it growe into 
a leady colour, and then doth suppurate 
and degenerate into Hypopion, for that hapneth 
to the eye that hapneth to the skin by 
some blowe, and groweth when corrupt 
matter is in great aboundance, so that it 
doth occupie halfe the blacke of the eye, 
or shineth through the horny coate, which 
couereth the whole apple of the eye: this 
[^p.40^] 
affect may r_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]se not onely of an vlcer, but also 
of great payne in the head, or inflamation 
in the eye that is corrupted, and besides 
inflamation, it may grow from aboundance 
of humors which doe breake open 
the mouthes of the veines: also, or stroake 
or falls may make the bloude disperse and 
flye abroad, which turneth to suppuration 
ad Pus when it is out of their proper vessels. 
To preuent the inconueniences, the patient 
must forthwith be let bloud in the arme, 
and in the temples, and in the corner of the 
eyes: if it be possible also we must vse cupping 
glasses vpon the shoulders, and such 
medicines as may stay inflamations: afterwards, 
we must vse such medicines as doe 
resolue and asswage payne, such as these.

If these medicines and remedies doe not 
preuaile, then we must trye another way: 
let the patient be set in a conuenient place, 
hauing one to stay his head behind, then 
let the Chyrurgian hold his with one hand 
with the instrument called Speculum oculi, 
described in Pareus Chirurgery, and with 
the other hand, with the point of a launcet 
he shall neatly and cunningly scarifie the 
[^p.42^] 
horny tunicle, vntill he come to the corrupted 
and slimy matter, which he shall 
make to auoide by little and little: After 
this worke ended, he shall vse repercussiue 
medicines, and medicines auoyding and 
ceasing paine, as the white of an egge beaten 
with rose and plantain waters, and then 
apply the remedies which shal be set down 
for vlcers in the eyes, which be clensing, 
increasing flesh, and closing vp: Moreouer 
the Chyrurgian must be very carefull 
least flesh grow in the incision of the Membrain, 
which will bring both hurt, and 
also deformity to the partie; to preuent 
which, this Collyrium is much availeable, 
and also commended, and doth 
also preuent inflammation.

and plantaine waters. 
 
[}Of Strabismus}] 
 
Strabismus is an euill motion of the Muscles, 
mouing the eyes, or a conuulsion of 
the eies, which if it be vnnaturall is vncurable, 
and that which commeth by accidents, 
is hardly or neuer to be cured, vnlesse 
perhaps it be in infants: for the eye, 
for examples sake, being conuulsed, is reduced 
ad leuam Rasis, and Auicen doth 
commend the bloud of Turtle to be instilled: 
also the pye is eaten with profit, 
and the powder thereof is referred into a 
Collyrium: some suppose that the head of 
a Bat being burnt and powdered; others 
commend the head of a Swallow taken by 
insufflation. 
 
[}Of Amaurosis, or Gutta Serena, or Obsuscatio, 
starke blindnes, or Hallucinatio. 
Chap. 5.}] 
 
Amaurosis is commonly an hindrance 
to the whole sight, without any appearance 
at all in the eye, for the apple appeareth 
sound and vnchanged, onely the Neruus 
opticus is stopped: this disease is vncurable, 
because there are no remedies therefore: 
[^p.44^] 
wherefore as yet the humor being not setled 
as Ætius doth testifie, that he saw one 
that did recouer the si_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ht, onely with the 
applying of cupping glasses with scarificacion. 
Remedies are not to be neglected, often 
purgation with the pils of Iod, with Trochisks 
of Albandall, Hydroticks, Masticatoria, 
and also vehement Errhina are not 
to be neglected, for in this onely affect of 
the eyes they doe good, the braine must be 
dryed with a cappe fit for the same, cautiers 
must be applyed at the roote of the 
eare, for that cause remembred by Fernelius, 
and in Inio for reuulsion, beware you 
forget not to vse cupping glasses. When 
the eye is exasperated, annoynt it with fresh 
butter, aed instilling therein womans milke, 
also the muscilage of philium, of quinces, of 
fenugreek, and of tragagant are to be applied, 
let the Muscilage be drawne in the 
decoction of Mallowes, Holyhocks, Violets 
&c. Ætius doth much commend this 
salue.

not in the eye. 
 
Of Opthalmia, or inflamation of the adnata, 
or coniunctiua. Chap. 6. 
 
Opthalmia is properly an inflamation of 
the Adnata or Coniunctiua, which is known 
by rednes, payne, heat, and stretching out 
[^p.47^] 
when there is rednes without tumor, especially 
by some outward cause, as by dust 
and smoake, it is properly called Taraxis: 
when the white of the eye is so swollen vpon 
the blacke, so that a kinde thereof appeareth 
to hang forth, it is then called Chemosis: 
some affirme it to be Chemosis when 
the Membrain coniunctiua is higher lifted 
then the Cotnea, as if this were in an hole, 
which besides the rednes and heat causeth 
the eye-lids to be turned, so that they cannot 
couer the eye: contrary to this is Phimosis, 
when by some great inflamation the 
eie-lids doe stick fast each to other and cannot 
be opened, but the hurt which they receiue 
is but an accident in this disease. Epiphora, 
is generally taken for a suddaine 
streame of humors in any part. As Pliny 
calleth epiphoram vteri or ventris, notwithstanding 
it is properly vsed for the affect in 
the eies: when with great inflamation great 
quantity of humors flow vnto them all these 
aforesaid affects do accompany each other: 
the causes are the recourse of bloud, choler, 
flegme, and melancholy, but most commonly 
bloud & choler: the generall cure for this 
disease doth consist in bloud-lettings, diet, 
purging by the aduise of a learned Phisition 
[^p.48^] 
because Opthalmicis Diarrheam Superuenire 
bonum est, we must not omit to vse cupping 
glasses vpon the Shoulders with scarification 
which wilbe good for reuulsion, also an 
Astringent frontall to intercept the fluxe, if 
it seeme to be outwards. In the beginning 
a repellent Collyrium to hinder the generation 
of Phlegmon which must be framed of 
the muscilage of phillium and of quinces, 
and then a resoluing Collyrium of the muscilage 
of fenugreek, being well washed 
from its byting quality. Abstinence from 
wine, in the beginning is very necessary, yet 
in the declination wine may be permitted 
euen as a bath of sweet water, to contemperate 
the bloud, is at the beginning denied, 
least it should cause the humor to shed, and 
increase the defluxion. If the inflamation 
do continue the muscilage beforsaid shalbe 
drawne in the water of poppy, or in a 
decoction thereof, adding thereunto a little 
camphire or opium, and apply to the eie 
this cataplasme. Take of sodden apples 
iiij. ounces, and with the white of an egge 
and womans milk, make a cataplasme: you 
must be carefull to renew these medicins 
least they dry oner fast, and so cause heate: 
not long after vse this Collyrium.

[^p.50^] 
inflamations of the eies, to take snayle 
with the shells, and to beate them with a 
little salt, and thorow an hypocras bagge 
to let the water thereof distill, which being 
cleare put thereof into the eies. It sometimes 
falleth out by vnaduised applications, 
which doth coole and beate back, or else 
by some inflamation, that the naturall heate 
is extinguished and choaked, and therevpon 
ensueth a worse inflamation, then any of 
the aforenamed, which is spha_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]elosous opthalmia, 
which doth depriue the eie of naturall 
temperature, doth make it corrupt and 
vtterly perish, which disease Galen in his introduction 
calleth grangrena opthalmon the 
gangren or mortification of the eie: when 
this happneth wee must haue recourse to 
proper remedies for gangrens, chaunging 
them as the state of the disease and the part 
shall require. 
 
[}Of the suffusion of sight called Cataracta. 
Chap. 7.}] 
 
Hypochyma or Cataracta is an heape of 
superfluous humors made thick betweene 
the coate Cornea and the humor crystalloydes 
or crystallinus directly vpon the apple 
[^p.51^] 
of the eie, swimming aboue the aqueus 
humor in that place, which Celsus doth affirme 
to be voyd and empty: it hindereth 
the sight, or at the least the discerning of 
such things as are before our eies. Fernelius 
appointeth the place of it betweene the 
membraim Vuea and the Cristallin humor: 
The difference thereof is borrowed from 
the quantity or quality; from the quantity, 
when it is whole, couering all the compasse 
of the apple of the eie, in such sort that the 
patient cannot see any thing, sometimes it 
doth couer onely halfe the apple of the eie 
or some part of it, either aboue or beneath, 
or in the midst, in such manner that that 
onely part of the thing before our face 
can be discerned, which is placed against 
the part of the eie, which is affected: Some 
there are that doe contend and affirme that 
this suffusion is no disease, but an outward 
moysture collected before the pupil, or apple 
of the eie, which humidity seeing that 
it is a substance doth not seeme to be a disease, 
because it is a quallity, and is placed 
vnder the predicament of quality: but to 
leaue an ouer curious questioning, whether 
it be a disease, or quality, we will proceed 
to the cure. Now to proceed in order to 
[^p.52^] 
the cure: first you must purge the braine, 
with pils that are proper for that purpose, 
and giue them to the patient, the day before 
you begin your cure: then the next 
day following, about nine of the clock in the 
morning, the patient yet fasting. (prouided 
that the cataract be ripe, and confirmed) 
cause him to sit ouertwhart a stoole, in ryding 
fashion, and sit on the same stoole 
face to face, and make the patient to hold 
his sound eie closed with his hand, and in 
that sort charge him to sit steadfastly without 
starting, or stirring in any-wise: let another 
also stand behind him, and hold his 
head very stedfast: this done, first with 
your owne hand lift vp the ouer-eie-lid, and 
then with thy other hand put in thy needle, 
made for that purpose nat the greater corner 
of the eie, and finely trilling the tunicle 
called saluatella, or saluatrix, writh alwaies 
thy finger to and fro, till thou touch with 
the point of thy needle the corrupt water, 
which is indeed the cataracte: and then begin 
by little and little, to remoue that water 
from before the sight, to the corner of the 
eie, and keepe it there with the point of 
your needle, the space of three minuts of 
an houre, and then remoue your needle easily 
[^p.53^] 
from it, and if it happen to rise againe, 
bring it back the second time: but this you 
must beware of, that when the needle hath 
touched the catarract, you doe not writh 
it about with your fingers to and fro, till 
it be set in his place before named, but to 
draw it thither gently, and when you haue 
it there, trill the needle about vntill it hath 
gathered the water about it, and then pull 
it out: when this is done cause him to shut 
close his eie, and apply therevpon a plaster 
of flaxe, and the white of an egge, and cause 
him to lie in his bed nine daies together, 
remouing the plaster three times in the day, 
and so many times in the night, without 
any other stirring of it, and prouide also 
that hee lie in a very darke place, and let 
him be kept in a thin diet, as reare egges 
and white bread: and if hee be young, and 
of strength, let him drinke Barly water, but 
otherwise let him drinke small ale, and wine 
delayd with water, for truely too much 
nourishment would offend, in procreating 
too much bloud in the eie, which is very 
hurtfull in the beginning of the cure. When 
the ninth day is past, let him arise and wash 
his eies with faire cold water, and hee 
shall inioy his sight by the helpe of GOD. 
[^p.54^] 
euen as well as hee had it before.
