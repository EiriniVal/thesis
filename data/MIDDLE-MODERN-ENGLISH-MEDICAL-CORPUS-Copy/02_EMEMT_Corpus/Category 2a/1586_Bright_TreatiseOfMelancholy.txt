[}A TREATISE 
OF MELANCHOLIE.}] 
 
[}CHAP 1. 
How diuerslie the word Melancholie 
is taken.}] 
 
BEFORE I enter to define 
the nature of 
mela~cholie, & what 
it is, for the cleare 
vndersta~ding of that 
wherein my purpose 
is to instruct you, it 
shall be necessarie to 
lay forth diuerse maners 
of taking the 
name of melancholie, and whereto the name being 
one, is applied diuerslie. It signifieth in all, 
either a certayne fearefull disposition of the 
mind altered from reason, or else an humour of 
the body, co~monly taken to be the only cause of 
reason by feare in such sort depraued. This humour 
is of two sorts: naturall, or vnnaturall:naturall 
is either the grosser part of the bloud ordained 
for nourishment, which either by abundance 
[^p.2^] 
or immoderate hotenesse, passing measure, 
surchargeth the bodie, and yeeldeth vp to 
the braine certaine vapors, whereby the vnderstanding 
is obscured; or else is an excrement ordained 
to be auoyded out of the bodie, through 
so manie alterations of naturall heate, and varietie 
of concoction, hauing not a drop of nourishing 
iuyce remaining, whereby the bodie, either 
in power or substance may be relieued. This 
excrement, if it keepeth the bounds of his owne 
nature, breedeth lesse perturbance either to bodie 
or minde: if it corrupt and degenerate farther 
from it selfe and the qualitie of the bodie; 
then are all passions more vehement, & so outragiously 
oppresse and trouble the quiet seate of 
the mind, that all organicall actions therof are 
mixed with melancholie madnesse; and reason 
turned to a vaine feare, or plaine desperation, 
the braine being altered in his complexion, and 
as it were transported into an instrument of an 
other make then it was first ordained: these two 
according to the diuersitie of setling, do ingender 
diuersitie of passions, & according therunto 
do diuerslie affect the vnderstanding, & do alter 
the affection, especially if by corruption of nature 
or euill custome of manners the partie be 
ouer passionate. The vnnaturall is an humour 
rising of melancholie before mentioned, or else 
from bloud or choler, whollie chaunged into an 
other nature by an vnkindly heate, which turneth 
these humours, which before were raunged 
vnder natures gouernment, and kept in order, 
into a qualitie whollie repugnant, whose 
substance and vapor giueth such annoyance to 
[^p.3^] 
all the partes, that as it passeth or is seated maketh 
strange alterations in our actions, whether 
they be animal or voluntarie, or naturall not depending 
vpon our will, and these are all which 
the name of melancholie doth signifie: now the 
definition and what it is. As the thinges be diuerse, 
so it also followeth the suite, and is likewise 
diuerse either of the humour or of the passion, 
and the humour being either a nutritiue 
iuyce or an excrement vnprofitable thereunto, 
I define the humor no otherwise then that part 
of that bloud which naturally of the rest is most 
grosse, and the excrement the superfluitie of the 
same; which if it putrifieth, bestoweth still the 
name of a farre diuerse thing both in temper & 
nature, called blacke choller. The melancholie 
passion is a doting of reason through vaine 
feare procured by fault of the melancholie humour. 
Thus brieflie & clearly do you vnderstand 
what the nature of melancholie is, and whereto 
the name is vsually applied: of which when 
I shall haue at the full to your contentment entreated, 
then will I satisfie the other part of your 
demaund, and lay open the consent and difference 
betwixt the conscience oppressed with 
sence of sinne and this naturall kinde before me~tioned, 
and minister vnto you such heauenlie 
comfort and counsell as my slender skill will affoord, 
and such phisicke helpe as your present 
neede requireth. 
 
[}CHAP. II. 
The causes of naturall melancholie 
and of the excesse thereof.}] 
 
[^p.4^] 
AS all naturall humours rise of nourishment, 
so melancholie being a part of bloud, from 
thence it springeth also. Whatsoeuer we receaue 
into the bodie for sustentation of this fraile life, 
consisteth of diuersitie of partes, being it selfe 
compounded, although to the outward viewe it 
seemeth to appeare vniforme: as bread, fleshe, 
fish, milke, wine, beare &c. which shewe of vniformitie 
being taken away by the naturall furnace, 
which preserueth the liuely heate of euerie 
liuing thing, that outward resemblance vanisheth, 
and the diuersitie manifesteth it selfe: as 
we see gold or siluer, before it be proued with 
fire appeareth no other then all alike: but afterward 
is discouered by the burning crucible 
to be much otherwise; so fareth it with nourishments, 
whose diuerse partes are layd open by so 
manifold concoctions, and cleansings, and straininges, 
as are continually without intermission 
practized of nature in euerie mans bodie: no 
gold finer, more busie at the mine, or artificiall 
Chymist halfe so industrious in his laboratorie, 
as this naturall Chymist is in such preparations 
of all nourishment: be it meat, or drinke, of what 
sort soeuer. By this meanes the bloud which seemeth 
in all parts like it selfe, no egge liker one to 
another, is preserued distinct in all partes. The 
purest part which we call in comparison and in 
respect of the rest bloud, is temperate in qualitie, 
and moderate in substance, exceeding all the 
other parts in quantitie, if the bodie be of equall 
temper, made for nourishment of the most temperate 
parts, and ingendring of spirits. The second 
is fleume, next to bloud in quantitie, of a 
[^p.5^] 
waterie nature, cold and moyst, apt to be conuerted 
into the substance of purebloud if nature 
faile not in her workinge ordained for 
nourishment of moyster partes. The thirde is 
melancholie, of substance grosse and earthie, 
cold and drie in regard of the other, in quantity 
inferiour to fleume, fit nourishment for such 
partes as are of like temper. The fourth, choler, 
fierie, hote, and driest of qualitie, thinne in substance; 
least in quantitie, and ordained for such 
parts as require subtiller nourishment, and are 
tempered with greater portion of the fierie element. 
These differences nature hath so distinguished, 
that although in veine and place, they 
remaine linked together, yet in faculty, and vertue 
they are diuerse the one from the other: 
which as they fit the varietie of parts, bloud the 
temperate, and the rest such partes as haue like 
declining from temperate: so by the maruelous 
working of nature, these varieties of humours 
are entertained by nourishmentes inclining to 
like disposition: although no nourishment can 
be vtterly voide of all these partes, no not those 
that are counted most to encline to any one humour, 
as beefe, and veneson to melancholie: honie, 
and butter, to choler: and fish to fleume. 
Hereof riseth then this humour melancholie, euen 
from nourishments, as all the humours do; 
and although not of such excellent vse; yet as 
necessarie for the maintenance of lyfe and substaunce 
of the bodie as anie other; neither do 
these humoures fall into mans nature onely: 
but what soeuer liuing creature hath bloud 
can not be destitute of them as partes thereof, 
[^p.6^] 
more or lesse according to their diuerse complexion. 
Thus then as man consisteth of partes 
requiring this diuersitie of foode, necessarie it 
was, and so ordained by God, such humours 
might aunswer in like varietie: and as humours 
are diuerse; so likewise the matter whereof they 
should be wrought could not be of one sort, and 
therefore all kinde of nature ordained for nourishment, 
affoord this choyce, some in greater 
scarsitie, this or that, to the end no state of body 
should complaine. Here you may mooue a question 
not impertinent to the matter in hande; 
whether some bodies do not turne good nourishment, 
& of the purest sort into greater quantitie 
of melancholie, then other some, and whether 
that of nourishment which of it selfe would 
yeeld store of the best iuyce, by melancholicke 
or rather cold and drie disposition of the body, 
can so be altered as to faile of that store, wherewith 
by nature it is replenished, and in steede 
thereof yeelde this grosse, thicke, cold & earthie 
humour, whereof I nowe discourse. Againe whether 
these humours are in such natures, as yeeld 
nourishment, and so by separation only after an 
Anaxagorian manner appeare, or rather are 
made as a stoole out of timber, bread of corne, 
wine of grape, &c. 
 
[}CHAP. III. 
VVhether good nourishment breedeth not store of 
melancholie by fault of the bodie: whether it 
turneth not into melancholie: and whether these 
humours are found in nourishments, or rather 
are made out of them.}] 
[^p.7^] 
THESE questions are not voide of probabilitie 
on both sides, which to the ende the 
truth may lye the more apparant, I will not stick 
to declare vnto you. It should seeme (as the obiection 
importeth) that which before hath bene 
attributed to the kind of nourishme~t should rather 
rise of the bodie nourished, co~sidering how 
it altereth, which it embraceth for nourishment, 
as consider the earth it selfe, the mother and very 
nurse of all corruptible thinges, howe out of the 
same soyle, not halfe a foote betwixt the wholesome 
fruit and soueraigne medicine, both spring 
vp together with deadly poison: yea how in the 
self same creature what strange diuersitie of nature 
ariseth of the selfe same nourishment: as in 
the Pastinaca marina, whose substance and flesh is 
wholsome to eat, & yet the taile carrieth a most 
deadly weapon, wherewith whatsoeuer is wounded, 
perisheth without recouerie, not by anye 
foraine tincture, but by the nourishment altered 
in that part into such a pernicious disposition. 
The same is also found in the flies Cantharides, 
whose bodie exulcerateth all parts, but especiallie 
the bladder, and is not inferiour to the chiefe 
poisons, contrarilie the wings help wherein the 
bodie hurted; which may be no small reasons of 
of doubte; whether the humors be found in nourishments, 
or rather are made by a certaine disposition 
of the bodie; as who would imagine, 
bloud could euer be made of yron; which notwithstanding, 
the Ostridges alter in such sort, as 
by no heate of fire, it can be sooner molten then 
it is digested in the stomach of that fethered 
foule? nowe nature digesteth nothing but to 
[^p.8^] 
make vse of nourishment thereof: else whatsoeuer 
entreth into the body, passeth as it commeth, 
and hath no welcomming: but is refused as impertinent; 
nature bestowing no handling therof: 
more then a skilfull painter to counterfait the 
fashion of some excellent beautie, would dip his 
pensill in the mire, in steed of perfect colour. To 
these probabilities may be added, how some natures 
chaunge into a farre diuerse qualitie that 
which they haue receaued, then it stood by nature, 
as the family of Marsie in Italie, & Psillie in 
Lybia: which was so te~pered, that they did without 
hurt sucke the poyson of vipers, and without 
perill did vsually hunt them: and so by necessarie 
consequence to bee gathered, that they did receaue 
nourishment by them. What soeuer entreth 
into the stomach, either is altered into familiaritie 
of nature: or else hauing an actuall 
power not hindered, altereth with repugnancie 
the nature which hath receaued it. If it altereth 
it whollie, then destroyeth it; if in part; then carieth 
it on the one part nourishing and alimentarie 
vertue, and on the other, a medicinable 
power; so it should seeme these Psillie, euen by 
vertue of nature made nourishment of that, 
which to other is deadlie poyson. Whereupon it 
may be gathered, that nourishme~ts in some bodies 
haue not such power, as I haue said before: 
seeing they be made in certaine of poyson. The 
same may be declared in duckes and hennes, 
which feede vpon toads, notwithstanding their 
flesh we feed of with health, and strength, to our 
bodies: Quailes likewise feede of neesing powder 
seedes, and feldfares of hemlocke, the one 
[^p.9^] 
much approching nigh vnto, and the other famous 
by the Athenian executions, for most infamous 
poison, al which notwithstanding, their 
flesh is not refused at the tables of the most delicate 
and daintiest: hereby in apparance it seemeth 
that it skilleth not much, what meat is receaued 
in respect of sustaining this or that complexion: 
seeing that poysons may be made by 
vertue of concoction familiar nourishment: yea 
which is more auailable to vphold this matter, 
and straunge to consider of: it hath bene known 
and is recorded in credible historie, that some 
haue bene brought vp from their youth and alwaies 
haue bene sustained and fed with poyson: 
which being so, the nourishments of the bodie 
not onely receaue preparation by naturall concoction, 
by which they become that in deede & 
effect, which before they were in power & possibilitie: 
but seeme to be made out of whatsoeuer 
is receaued; where it findeth a nature of sufficient 
strength to frame it: and not (as it was 
wont to be sayd) Mercurie is not made of euery 
tree, so nature maketh euerie thing of any thing: 
not by Anaxagoras art, for then should breade 
containe really, corporallye, and substantially 
flesh, bloud and bone, but by a power and vertue 
whereof the matter hath no part, more then 
the gold for the framing of a iewell partaketh 
of the goldsmithes cunning. 
 
[}CHAP. IIII. 
The answer to the former obiections.}] 
 
THESE shewes and semblances of truthes 
[^p.10^] 
may seeme to ouerthrowe that which hath 
bene set downe as the ground and matter of humours, 
& lay it rather in the nature of the thing 
nourished, to transforme and assimilate whatsoeuer 
it hath receaued, though it bee of neuer 
so straunge a qualitie: but as I haue set downe 
these obiections, to the end that trueth being 
compared with vntruth may the better appeare 
by reason of comparison, so marke for your fuller 
satisfying in this point, howe yet nothing is 
hereby lost, but sufficiently it maintaineth it 
selfe: and by strength of reason, the onely pillar 
of humane truthes it is vpholden. It was declared 
before how nourishments as of all other humours, 
so of melancholie, they affoord the matter, 
to the which nature applying her proper 
temper as an instrument, and practizing that 
skill which she hath learned of God, worketh 
out both humours and substance for preseruation 
and nourishment of our bodies; nowe that 
the earth within small distance affoordeth nourishment 
both to henbane & lettis, to hemlocke 
and the mallow, to poison and wholsome herbs; 
that the same flower nourisheth the spider, and 
yeldeth honie to the bee, that the pastinaca marina 
carieth the instrument of death in her tayle, 
and wholsome foode in her substance, and all 
what hath bene before obiected from Cantharides; 
the Ostridges, Psillie and Marsi, neesing 
powder, hemlocke and toades, whereof wholesome 
birds do aduenture for nourishment, and 
from that virgine fed and sustained with poison 
sent vnto Alexander to infect him with hir companie: 
all I say that may out of these particulars 
[^p.11^] 
encounter the former truthes, being considered 
and wayed, adde this thereunto (taking away 
nothing) that to the disposition of the matter, it 
is also necessarie, an outward skill and science in 
the worker concurre, whereby that matter may 
receaue conuenient forme agreable to the workers 
intention. For as it is impossible to make a 
rope of sande, so likewise hempe maketh it not 
without the art of the craftes man, who ioyning 
his worke with conuenient stuffe findeth the 
end of his labour: and as some workemen exceede 
other in skill & diligence and of the same 
matter, the worke either excelleth or wanteth 
according thereunto; in like manner the nourishment 
being all one, as it falleth to a nature 
of good or bad temper, weake or strong, bringeth 
forth nourishment, and excrement accordingly. 
Touching the earth it containeth in it 
inuisible seedes of all thinges in a maner, to which 
it storeth vp and importeth also food meet and 
conuenient: these seeds lye not distinct in place 
but in nature, no more then the partes of bloud 
which before I mentioned, so that although it 
were possible for hemlocke & the vine to grow 
in one bodie, and occupie one place, yet could 
not the proper nourishment to either be auoyded: 
such harmonie and agreement is there betwixt 
them in nature, and with such earnest desire 
doth the one affect the other. This then is 
the cause why life and death dwell so nigh together, 
and yet (as they are of the vehementest 
sort of aduersaries) without entercommunication: 
Euen so the bodie containeth partes linked 
notwithstanding in one communitie, of diuerse 
[^p.12^] 
natures, which drawe out of the masse of nourishment 
that which is meete ech one for it self: 
which though it in apparance, & shew, semeth 
vniforme, yet containeth it diuersitie, as the sundrie 
parts require: which diuersitie being distinct 
in nature, & confused as it appeareth in one by 
the cloke & garment of an vniuersall forme: by 
natures Mechanical operation (the very paterne 
of all arts, both liberall and seruile), is discouered 
& brought into an actuall substance consisting 
of his single & proper nature, which before 
had only a potentiall subsistence as members & 
parts haue in the whole. Which producing I vnderstand 
not a discouerie only, as by withdrawing 
availe, to shew that which lay behind it, but 
a generation and coupling of matter with the 
forme: which forme it bringeth not with it, but 
receaueth it as it were an impression from the 
part. So then, as euerie thing is not made of anye 
thing in art: neither is foode ministred for all 
things in euerie thing in nature: but requireth 
apt preparation of matter, by naturall vertue to 
be appropriate to euerie part. Now if it be replied: 
this answer, as it may suffice against that 
which is obiected out of the earth, yet leaueth it 
doubt in the pastinaca; Cantharides and Psillie: by 
reason the matter of these things through natures 
working groweth more particular, & is not 
stored with such varietie (as I may so call them) 
of potentiall natures: whereby it might seeme 
the verie indiuiduall substance indifferently to 
subiect it selfe either for nourishment or poison: 
let the consideration of the earth carrie vs yet 
farther to the dissoluing of this knot also. True 
[^p.13^] 
it is, that the particular nourishment containeth 
not so manie sutes, as the earth the nourisher of 
all things doth: yet it answereth in proportio~ to 
the part which it hath to sustaine. So that the 
masse of bloud being the vniuersall soile, wa~teth 
not for the relief & entertainment of al the me~bers 
of the bodie, choise of substance according 
to their varietie. Hereof is the bone nourished, as 
hard as mettall: and the braine as tender as a 
posset curd: the kidneyes grosse and thicke: and 
the lights loose and subtile: the eye as cleere as 
cristall: and the spleene as blacke and darke as 
inke. Now let vs apply this more particularly to 
Pastinaca, Cantharis, and the rest of that sort, 
The Pastinaca, substance, and fish, is nourished 
with that which in it selfe is wholesome, the fish 
being of the same substance or disposition; but 
so, that, that nourishment hath in it an execremental 
substance, which being considered alone 
though it be not yet poyson, hath in it a power, 
meeting with a former, to become of like hurtfull 
qualitie: which we see in execrements being 
permitted to putrifie and to degenerate of them 
selues, howe by corruption they become moste 
daungerous; much more finding an actiue and 
liuely nature furnished with power as it were to 
animate and waken that which before lay dead 
in such matter: so Pastinaca hath a weapon geuen 
by nature soked with most deadly venome 
separated yet from the fish, and sticking on the 
one side on the middest of the taile, which is 
maintained with such a kinde of excrement, as 
being reiected in all the parts, findeth there impression 
and entertainment: not either that the 
[^p.14^] 
fish feede of that poison (for nothing feedeth of 
excrement, appropriate to one part, or that 
wherewith that part, while it is excrement is 
nourished) as venimous, for then should such 
as feede of that fish bee in perill, but being vnmeete 
to nourish or to haue place in the fishe, is 
of temper, (by the altering of that part) apt to 
be conuerted into so venemous a nature, which 
is planted in the fishes tayle, not much vnlike to 
the growing of Misleto in a crab tree, whose natures 
do apparantly differ, seing the same Misleto 
groweth also in the oke & on the hauthorne: 
neither can anie with reason affirme, the Misleto 
is nourished with that which belongeth to 
the crab: for then would it not prosper in the 
oke destitute of his proper iuyce, but both the 
oke, the crab tree and the hauthorne, certaine 
of them, and in certaine places, hauing a superfluitie 
meete for that vse, the seed of that Misleto 
being there & embracing that humour, riseth 
vp into such a diuerse plant as we see, which yet 
according to the diuersitie of place, varieth in 
vertue, for that onely of the oke we vse and accompt 
auaileable against the falling sicknesse & 
esteeme the other of small value. Nowe if it be 
demaunded, why then groweth not the misle on 
the earth, which hath more plenty of such iuice, 
and greater choyce? it may be thys answered: 
although the earth affoordeth entertainement 
for all things, yet it doth it diuersly, to some immediately, 
to other some by meanes, as the earth 
ministreth iuyce to the grasse and herbe of the 
common fielde, it nourisheth mutton, & we feed 
thereof; who if we should attempt to be releeued 
[^p.15^] 
by the hearbe, it would yeeld vs but thinne 
fare. This iuyce of the earth is altered into an 
other nature in the herbe, that herbe into fleshe, 
and flesh of that kinde chaunged into the substance 
of our bodies, which first as it sprung vp 
from the earth, so by it is it releued. So the misle 
draweth from the earth, by meanes of the tree 
wherewith it prospereth, indued now with other 
forme, & made more familiar vnto it, by the preparation 
of the tree. And this I take to be the 
cause why certaine things will not growe on the 
earth, but in other natures: and why graffes 
yeld more pleasant fruit then carnels, by reason 
the stocke giueth the crude and rawe nourishment 
of the earth a farther ripening, and euen 
as it were chewing it vnto the sion graffed, so to 
conclude this answere; the Pastinacas venome 
is ministred by an excrement, which carieth an 
aptnes to be co~uerted into poison: and such poison 
as that part is able therof to engender, neither 
being such before in the Pastinaces nourishment, 
nor in the substaunce of the fish, not as 
excrement; but after it is conuerted thereinto 
by that barbed weapon, which the fish reue~geth 
within her taile. Whereby it is euident, that not 
only of poison, but of any humor beside, the aptnes 
of the matter (whereof some be grosser, and 
some passe more alterations) it is necessary also 
there shoulde concurre in the place nourished, 
an altering vertue; and as such assimilation is 
necessarie, in like manner an apt matter may not 
be to seeke, fit for such generation. Wherefore 
Melancholie is not made of euerie part of good 
nourishment, but of such part, as hath a token 
[^p.16^] 
of fellowship with the same Melancholie: and 
more or lesse, as the bodie is more or lesse apte, 
together with aptnesse of the matter to make 
that conuersion. Touching the Ostridge which 
may seeme to turne yron into bloud and so into 
flesh: wee are rather thus to esteeme, that although 
the Ostridges nature doth intend nourishment 
by the yron; yet doth it no more nourish, 
then stones doth chickins, & hennes which 
are dissolued in their mawes. How the~ (say you) 
& why doth it dissolue yron? by a contrarie vertue 
which respecteth all thinges alike, that are 
receiued: whereby the stomach becommeth the 
most Catholicke parte in all the bodie, carying 
a more indifferent affection to whatsoeuer is 
receiued then anie part beside, which in the first 
concoctio~ regardeth not so much it self as other 
partes, for whose sake it is ordayned, as it were, 
the Cooke not respecting this or that sorte of 
nourishment or foode, but applying it selfe alike 
generally to all that hath not a resistance in nature 
and a counterpower of poyson, which alwaies 
altereth and is not altered. Else could it 
not so easilie embrace both hote and cold, sower 
and sweete, fat and leane, moyst and drie, of all 
bougetts (as a certaine Poet sayth) in that respect 
the straungest: by this vertue the Ostridges 
hauing a very thick and fleshie mawe, whereby 
it is furnished with store of a naturall heate dissolueth 
by a kinde of putrefaction, the yron; 
which if it yeeld anie nourishment, the stomach 
findeth benefite thereof in the bloud, wherwith 
it is nourished, if none, it passeth all into excrement 
and so is voyded as vnprofitable, except it 
[^p.17^] 
may be thought more likely in reason, that the 
Ostridges enioyeth some parte of nourishment, 
thereby passing it into bloud, or at the least that 
the stomach receiueth a kinde of comfort and 
contentment, which commonly it is taken to do 
by the nourishment it containeth as the Cooks 
appetite may be satisfied for a time by smelling 
of the rost, which if it faire so with the stomach 
there is then reason sufficient of such digestion 
which the fowle worketh not by the excesse of 
heat, but by a certaine temper apt for the work, 
for no heate of fire in longe time is able to doe 
that which the Ostridge mawe doth speedelie 
by a certaine corruption of that which it digesteth. 
Carying as it were a kinde of Aqua fortis in 
the mawe, rather then anie heate of Etna, if wee 
take it that the fowle hath some parte in the bodie, 
whose turne the common officer, the stomach 
serueth, agreeing to the nature of some 
substance contained in the yron, & that conueyed 
into the bloud, and from thence drawen to 
that part, wherof it is affected: or it hath an Alementarie 
vertue common to diuerse partes. Bee 
it so, yet therefore no consequence of reason can 
inferre, that nature respecteth not anie aptnes 
of matter: for in a manner al things of the earth 
hath some thinge Alimentarie and pasturable 
for all liuing creatures, which may euidently appeare 
by comparing of nature. The earth which 
we plow and till and labour with hard and wearie 
hand is altogether mynerall, which is the generallest 
nourishment of all: now if one nature 
among so manie millions be found in yron to 
sucke forth that vertue, no maruell seing all creatures 
[^p.18^] 
which require reliefe of foode, by certaine 
degrees and former operations, pertake 
of the same: then seeing the Mineralls feede the 
Vegetalls, and the Vegetalls the Animalls; let 
the experience of the Ostridge satisfie vs in this 
which reason misliketh not, that euen a nutritiue 
iuice for some sort of Animall may be fou~d 
in yron, and yet so, that (notwithstanding) not 
all thinges are of like aptnes for such vse, neither 
in generall as bloud, nor in particular, as the 
more speciall food belonging to ech parte deriued 
from the bloud. And thus my friend M. to 
passe the tedious time with you, you haue my opinion 
to this obiection. As for the straunge nature 
of that kinde of people or famelie called 
Marsi and Psilli, we may thus reasonably coniecture, 
that either they had a nature of stronger 
temper, then the ordinary sorte, by which it was 
able to maister that poyson and all other; or else 
by the custome of vsuall feeding on the flesh of 
aspes and vipers, which they did vse, they grewe 
into such familiaritie with the poyson, as the serpentes 
themselues, which nature had with such 
poison so armed, and this rather then that infamous 
refuge of propriety of substance, which is 
asmuch to say, as we knowe not. This custome 
was also the only cause why the yong maid nourished 
with poison faired with it as with other 
victuall: for of purpose she was nourished from 
her infancie therwith, that she might by freque~ting 
the Kinges companie destroy him with infection, 
which poyson being but an accidentary 
thing, by custome is vanquished of a naturall & 
essentiall vertue. That poyson is but accidentall 
[^p.19^] 
and not essentiall, it appeareth by that in diuers 
kindes, it is not in all of the same sorte, nor alike 
in all partes of such natures, as wee count venemous, 
as the wings of Cantharides and the bodies 
so contend in nature, that the one helpeth 
where the other harmeth: the weapon of Pastinaca 
and the fish, the Scorpion and his stinge, 
the vipers bitte and vipers flesh, the base and 
foundation of Triacle, the shrewmouse and her 
selfe dissected and applied to the wound: which 
all argue the poyson not to bee equallie mixed, 
and therefore not essentiall: againe in some places 
Scorpions are not hurtefull, in some spiders, 
in other some aspides, the which if their nature 
did consist of poyson, then could they not be otherwise, 
neither receiue alteration by soile, neither 
is this in animalls onely, but also in vegetalls, 
as in Persea, in Hemlockes, in Napellus in 
the Vgh tree which in other some places carrie 
with them certaine and assured perill, and in other 
some are vtterly harmelesse. This custome 
being begunne in infancie, made a greater familiaritie 
betwixt the damsels nature, & the poyson, 
which as in ciuill manners it is more flexible 
in youth the~ in processe of yeares, so the disposition 
of nature fareth in like sort, which most 
hartely embraceth that wherewith it is first acquainted, 
but you wil say; how could it haue first 
accesse and be entertained of nature, to whome 
it is so repugnant. Thus we are to iudge in the 
case, that they which first practised this straunge 
kinde of nourishing, by litle and litle assayed nature, 
and now and then gaue harte therunto by 
counterpoyson preseruatiues, and so at the laste, 
[^p.20^] 
being encouraged, and farther strengthened, it 
was able to ouercome that parte of the poyson; 
which of it selfe was deadlie and turne the other 
into familiar nourishment, which by reason of 
acquainta~ce through custome, her nature brake 
which if it had ben all poyson, then as it had bin 
wholly & vnfit matter of nourishment, so could 
shee not without daunger haue borne it one 
howre: whereby it is manifest, that with natures 
arte an apt matter of producing of nourishment 
must needes meete for her maintenance. That 
which Cantharides offereth of doubt, may be 
sufficiently resolued by that which hath bin said 
of Pastinaca. The quailes feeding of He~lock, & 
the other neesing powder, moue more difficult 
questions, seing they make the poison holesome 
nourishment to themselues & yeelde their 
bodies, daintie dishes to our tables, notwithsta~ding 
their poysoned foode: Whereby it should 
seeme, that poyson it self, where a nature fitteth, 
therewith may be matter of holesome nourishment, 
for the satisfying of which obiection, we 
are to consider euerie parte of that we take for 
nourishment, is not alimentall but parte excrement, 
and that the greatest parte, as it appeareth 
by so manie alterations, and purginges, 
which the foode suffereth, before it be receiued 
of the partes of the bodie for proper nourishment. 
so therefore; these birds are not sustained 
with that which is poysonfull in their foode, but 
alter it first, and then passe it into superfluous 
excrement; their substance being vtterly voyde 
of the same, & so becometh vnto vs holesome: 
verie well: but how is their nature able to vanquish 
[^p.21^] 
that which is poyson: seing it not receiued 
of vs without present daunger? Diuerse reasons 
thereof may be alleadged, first, it is not poison 
vnto them, as we see some kindes of Aconites 
to kill dogges, some Leopardes, and some 
wolues, and not offensiue to our creatures: the~, 
that it may be by excessiue heate of the mawes 
of such birdes, then cold poyson of Hemlocke receiueth 
sufficient alteration to keepe of the perrill 
of poyson. Whereto may also be added, the 
reason of Galen, that because the vaines & passages 
of those birdes are straighte, the poyson 
before it assaileth the hart in the way receiueth 
sufficient alteration; especially Hemlock being 
so cold poyson, and therefore slowe of passage in 
respect of it selfe, and shutting vp, and straightening 
of poores, by which it passeth: so to conclude 
this probleme, we see the sentence standeth 
yet sure, that nourishments are the matter 
of all humors, and by consequence of Mela~cholie, 
and although natures wonderfull arte appeareth 
in making (as it may seeme in apparance) 
one contrarie to another, yet doth it not 
so in deede, but alwayes desireth conuenient 
matter to practise her naturall arte vpon: and 
thus much to the obiections, now to the questions 
themselues. 
 
[}CHAP. V. 
Touching the questions propounded in the 
end of the second Chapter.}] 
 
THVS much hath bene said to the obiectio~s, 
now let vs declare at large to your fuller satisfying, 
[^p.22^] 
what I iudge most agreable to the truth 
in the questions: and first, whether some bodies 
do not turne good nourishment, and of the purest 
sort into greater quantitie of melancholie, 
then other some? which question if we consider 
parted, it may more clearly be decided, that is, 
first whether the same nourishment bee not turned 
into more or lesse plentie of melancholie in 
other bodies? then, whether by anie qualitie of 
temper, good and pure nourishment may yeeld 
an humour melancholicke? To these questions 
first I aunswer affirmatively, yet not impairing 
of the former truth set downe. For all kinde of 
nourishment as it in part altereth the bodies, so 
is it againe of them more altered then it altereth, 
whereby melancholicke persons of the self 
same nourishment frame vnto them selues that 
which to them selues is agreeable: else coulde 
there be no nourishment without this alteringe 
vertue. Why then (say you) it riseth not of the 
nourishment, which was not melancholicke, but 
of the nature nourished. Not so, for no nourishment 
is so pure, that altogether it is void of melancholicke 
matter, for then could it not bee 
nourishment: but notwithstanding it hath greater 
plentie of good nourishment then of grosse 
and melancholicke, the similitude of nature refuseth 
the one, and embraceth the other: whereupon 
riseth this difference in norishment, the 
victuall being al one. The second part of the former 
question, receaueth the same answer with 
the first, because no nourishment is so pure but 
it partaketh little or much, with some part of 
melancholie. For I do not take it, that the parte 
[^p.23^] 
maketh the nourishment melancholicke, which 
carieth no disposition thereunto: but lusteth after 
that in the masse of victualles, wherewith it 
hath greater familiaritie, which to a melancholicke 
bodie is of an impurer disposition, refusing 
that would serue more fitlie for a better tempered 
complexion; euen as we see oft by experie~ce 
that the good complexion may be replenished 
with melancholicke bloud: which appeareth by 
opening a vaine, and yet the parties bodie nourished, 
 (as the beautie of colour doth declare) 
with that which is pure, which melancholicke 
bloud rose of euill choice of dyet, rather then 
through fault of complexion: now that part of 
nourishment, that is pure cannot be altered in 
substance into another, whereto it carrieth no 
proportion: by mixture it may be defiled, and 
become impure, but neither can it be altered into 
that, wherewith it hath no communitie, more 
then grosse, melancholicke, and earthye nourishment 
can by anie art of nature become aery, 
moderate and pure: I meane the self same part 
of nourishment: for so might all things indeede 
rise of euerie thing, which would turne the excellent 
varietie of naturall thinges into vnitie. 
As for Anaxagoras imagination of breedinge 
thinges by separation onely, this kind of diuerse 
matter, which we require in nourishment ouerthroweth 
it, neither are we to thinke generation 
of nourishment to be no other but as arte worketh 
vpon her subiecte, for there, is there no nature 
produced, distinct in substance and essence, 
but an accidentall qualitie only produced by 
art. And thus lest I be ouer tedious in this point, 
[^p.24^] 
you haue my answer to the questions & obiections 
before made concerning the nature of 
nourishing and preparation of humors, and hitherto 
that hath bene said, respecteth only melancholie, 
as it is an humour in the bodie apte 
for nourishment of certaine partes, more disposed 
to that, then to anie other portion of the 
bloud besides, nowe touching the cause of increase 
and excesse of this humour. 
 
[}CHAP. VI. 
Of the causes of the increase and excesse 
of melancholicke humour.}] 
 
IT was declared that the quantitie of melancholie 
should be least in the iust te~per of bloud 
of all the other parts, sauing choler, which naturall 
proportion and rate when it exceedeth, 
then is the bodie turned into a disposition melancholicke 
by humour: although the co~plexion 
for a time holde entire, which long can not endure, 
more then the nature of that damsel which 
was nourished with poyson, kept her ingenerated 
complexion: But nature acquainting it selfe 
by moments and degrees with such kind of humour, 
and hauing no choice of better, is faine 
at length to embrace that, which otherwise 
more gladly it would reiect. The causes of excesse 
of this humour are diuerse, and all (except 
it be receaued from the parent) spring from 
fault of diet: and although chiefely meates and 
drinkes do yeeld matter to this humour, yet besides 
the complexion inclining to such temper, 
this matter is increased by perturbatio~ of mind, 
[^p.25^] 
by temper of aire, and kind of habitation, and 
that humour which otherwise would yeeld a nutritiue 
iuyce, of the best sort, by this occasion is 
turned into these dregges of melancholie. Here 
first I will declare vnto you, such nourishments 
as are apt to engender those humours, that in 
this present state you nowe stand in, oppressed 
therewith, knowing which they are that minister 
matter to this grosse iuyce, you for your 
more speedie recouery auoide the~, and with 
choice of better, alter that which is amisse into 
a more cheerfull qualitie. Nowe all nourishments 
that offende vs, either do it by their 
owne nature, or by some accidentarie cause befalling 
vnto them, and likewise whatsoeuer becommeth 
vnto vs melancholicke. But that you 
may more easily vnderstande from whence all 
sorts of nourishments are taken, I will set downe 
vnto you in a short viewe, the kinds of them all, 
and in euerie kind note vnto you, that which of 
the owne nature is melancholicke. You knowe 
all nourishments are either meate or drinke: 
meates are taken either from vegetables or animalls: 
the vegetables either minister vnto vs 
nourishment themselues, or their fruit onely, & 
they are either of trees or herbs: of trees, the 
tender buds are eaten, which because wee do litle 
vse to feed of, I passe ouer farther mention. 
Of herbes we either feede of the root, or such 
partes as rise therefrom, and those rootes are either 
round or long, of neither sort do I remember 
anie greatly to bee eschewed as melancholicke, 
except rape rootes & nauewes. Such parts 
as rise from the root, are vsed while they be tender 
[^p.26^] 
and young, or else sprung vp at the full, of 
these kinds, coleworts, beete, and cabages only 
ingender a melancholicke iuyce. The fruites of 
vegetables are either of trees or herbes: of fruits 
of trees, quinces rawe, medlers, seruices, dates, 
oliues, chesnuts and acornes are all melancholicke: 
fruites of herbes, are either graine or of 
other sort, and those are either corne or pulse: 
of corne, sodden wheate is of a grosse and melancholicke 
nourishment, and bread especially 
of the fine flower vnleauened: of this sort, are 
bag puddings, or pan puddings made with flour, 
frittars, pancakes, such as wee call Banberie 
cakes, and those great ones confected with butter, 
egges &c. vsed at weddings, and howsoeuer 
it be prepared, rye and bread made thereof, carrieth 
with it plentie of melancholie. The pulses 
are wholy to be eschewed, of such as are disposed 
to melancholie: except white pease: fruites 
of herbes of other sorte then graine are purest 
from melancholicke excesse. And thus of vegetables 
you vnderstand, which you haue in this 
melancholicke respect to be auoyded. The food 
which wee take from the animals, is either from 
them selues, and from certayne of their wholesome 
excrementes. Such as yeelde themselues are either 
of the earth, or of the water: those of 
the earth haue great diuersitie of nourishment 
in their seuerall partes, which are either spermaticall, 
and those of white colour: or sanguine, of 
colour redde and bloudie. The sparmaticall 
partes may well be discharged of melancholicke 
iuyce, as rather enclining to fleume. Of the sanguine 
partes, some are the brawnie parts, which 
[^p.27^] 
compasse the bones, and are ordained for voluntarie 
motion, called muscles: or else are of 
the inward partes, and are of them selues destitute 
of motion. The muscles which are subiect 
to most motion, as of the leggs, yeeld more melancholie, 
then partes which haue more rest. 
Of the inwardes, the milt is altogether melancholicke, 
 & so the kidneyes, the liuer, the heart, 
and with them, all the carnels. Bloud is melancholicke, 
and whatsoeuer dish thereof is made. 
Nowe all nourishments taken from the earth, 
are either beasts, or foule. Of beasts; these are 
of melancholick persons to be eschewed: porke, 
except it be young, and a litle corned with salt, 
beefe, ramme mutton, goate, bores flesh, & veneson: 
neither is mutton of any sorte greatly 
commended of Galen. Of foule, some bee water 
foule, and some land. The water foule are not of 
melancholicke persons to be tasted, except the 
goosewings. The land foule which are melancholicke 
are these: feldfares, thrushes, sparowes, 
martins, turtles, ringdoues, quailes, plouers, 
peacockes &c. and these haue you to eschewe of 
nourishments of the earth. Those of the water 
are fish: & either of the salt water and sea; or of 
the fresh water. Such as are of the sea, are either 
of the monsters of the sea; or such as more properly 
are to be called fish. The mo~sters are ceals 
purposes, & such like: which all breed vnwholesome 
& melancholicke nourishment. The fish of 
the sea are either shell fish, or destitute of such 
defence. Of shell fish, some are of harder shels, 
as oysters, periwincks, muscles, cockles, & such 
like: of which ranke, the oyster carieth with it 
[^p.28^] 
least suspition of melancholy. The softer shell or 
crustie are cray fish, the crab, the lobster, the pu~ger, 
& such of the riuers like to these &c. which 
all neede not to bee excepted vnto you in order 
of your diet. Such sea fish as carie no armor 
of shels, are either those, that haunt the rocks: or 
other parts of the sea. The rocke fishes are most 
apt of all maner sea fish, for melancholicke persons: 
as the gilthead, the whiting, the sea perch 
&c. Such as haunt other places, are either keepers 
of the depth; or approchers nigh the sand & 
shore. Of such as keepe the depth, either they 
haunt the pooles: or other places of the depth. 
Of the poole fishes, I remember not any greatly 
to be auoyded in choyce of your dyet. Of such as 
frequent other places of the depth, these are 
melancholicke: the dragon of the sea, in forme 
like and eyle: the cuckoe, ling, any salt fish, thornbacke, 
and skate. Of such as approch the shore, 
I knowe none greatly to be auoyded. Fresh water 
fish, and of the riuer: the lampray, and the 
tench, haue most plentie of melancholie. And 
these are nourishments taken from the partes of 
the animals: now their works are either excrements, 
& superfluitie of their humors, or other 
kinds of workes. Of the first sort, are milke from 
the beast, and egges from the foule: which the 
spawne of fish in a maner resembleth: milke, and 
what soeuer is made thereof, is to be eschewed 
of melancholie persons: as cheese, curdes, &c. 
the spaunes, as roes of hearinges, are to be eschued 
of you, as nourishment of melancholie: 
else I take none of that sort greatly to be feared 
in that respect. Of other works of animals then 
[^p.29^] 
excrements, we feed only of honie, which hath 
no melancholy dispositio~ at al. Of drinks, eschue 
red wine, and what soeuer liquor, beare, ale, or 
cider, is not cleere, and well fined: as also if it bee 
tart, and sower. Hitherto haue you hearde of 
nourishmentes, which of thier owne nature are 
to be eschued; nowe of those that by some accident, 
and not of them selues are melancholicke, 
as if they bee too olde, and verie leane: 
or be long kept: or ouer much salted: whereby 
they become the dryer and harder, you are to 
refuse them. Likewise in the dressing of the 
nourishment, it be ouermuch baked, or rosted, 
it is to be eschued. To these belong salt fishe, 
beefe, and bacon, and redde hearringes, hard 
cheese, and old. Of drinkes, newe wine, beare 
or ale: and on the contrarie part, ouer stale, and 
sower, are to be eschued: and of sauces, those 
that be sharpe, as veriuyce, aliger, or beareger, 
vineger, are chieflie to be auoided of melancholicke 
persons. Thus do you vnderstand howe to 
vse your choice in meates, and drinkes: and what 
to shunne, as breeders of this thicke, blacke, and 
melancholicke humour. Besides these, the aire 
thicke and grosse is fit to entertaine this humor: 
so that fenny, marrish, mislty and lowe habitations, 
are hurtfull to persons disposed to melancholie: 
likewise if it be dim & dark. Wherfore 
the houses, and habitations of that sort, are most 
vnmeete for such persons. These hitherto are 
all such outward things melancholick: whatsoeuer 
else breedeth mela~cholie, is a disorderly behauiour 
of our owne parts, in such actions as belonge 
to the gouernment of our health. This 
[^p.30^] 
behauiour, is either in actions of motion: or in 
order and manner of rest. Our motion, is either 
of mind, or body. Of actions of the minde, ouer 
vehement studies, and sadde passions, do alter 
good nourishmentes into a melancholicke qualitie; 
by wasting the pure spirites, and the subtillest 
parte of the bloud: and thereby leauing the 
rest grosse and thicke. In like sorte do exercises 
either wholly intermitted; or turned into an excessiue 
labour, and wearying of the bodie: the 
one causing the bloud to be thicke through setling: 
and the other, by spending the bodie ouermuch, 
& drying it excessiuely. Such also as giue 
themselues to inordinate sleepe, therby further 
the encrease of melancholicke humours. And 
these are all the causes, whereby the matter of 
that humour is supplyed; and the bloud being of 
it selfe good, is altered into that iuice, whereof 
you complaine of abundance. Now if to these, 
you adde a nature of it selfe disposed thereto, & 
a splene not able, either for feeblenes, or obstruction, 
to purge the bloud of superfluitie of that 
iuyce, then haue you all that may be said of the 
causes of this humour, keeping within the compasse 
of nourishment. 
 
[}CHAP. VII. 
Of melancholicke excrementes.}] 
 
THE melancholicke excrement is bredde of 
melancholie iuyce, drawen of the milte out 
of the liuer, by a braunch of the porte vayne, 
wherewith being nourished, it reiecteth the rest 
as meere excrementall; and voydeth parte, into 
[^p.31^] 
the mouth of the stomach, to prouoke appetite, 
and hunger, and passeth the other parte in some 
persones, by hemerode vaynes into the siege: It 
aboundeth there when it is hindered of such 
passage as nature requireth; or else by feeblenes 
of the parte, it is not able, either to suck the melancholie 
from the bloud, or discharge itself into 
those passages, which nature hath therto ordained. 
This member, of the whole bodie is the 
grossest, and euillfauoredst to behold, blacke 
of colour, and euill sauorie of taste: and giueth a 
manifest experience of natures desire, alwayes 
to couet that, whereto it is most like; and so fareth 
the splene better with those muddy dreggs, 
then it would with purer and finer bloud; which 
if it should be offered to other parts, they would 
abstaine: except great want forced them to take 
anie parte thereof. These are the causes of naturall 
melancholie, both iuyce, and excrement: 
It remaineth next, to shewe, what that humour 
is, which riseth of this, or anye else, corrupted, 
called also by the name melancholie. 
 
[}CHAP. VIII. 
VVhat burnt Choler is, and the causes 
thereof.}] 
 
THAT kinde of melancholie, which is called 
Atra bilis, riseth by excessiue heate of such 
partes, where it is engendred or receiued, wherby 
the humour is so adust, as it becommeth of 
such an exulcerating, and fretting qualitie, that 
it wasteth those partes, where it lighteth; this 
most commonly ryseth of the melancholie excrement 
[^p.32^] 
before said, and diuerse times of the other 
thicke parte of bloud; as also of Choler, & 
salt fleame: which take such heate, partly by distemper 
of the bodie, and partly by putrefaction 
that thereby a humor riseth, breeding most terrible 
accidentes to the minde, and painefull to 
the bodie: which the melancholicke and grosse 
bloud, doth more forcibly procure: in that that 
anie heate, the grosser the substaunce is, wherein 
it is receaued, the more fiercely it consumeth: 
whereupon the seacole giueth more vehement 
heate, then charcole: and the cole then the 
flame: and a cauterie of hote yron, then a burning 
firebrand Otherwise choler being by nature 
of the hotest temper, carieth with it, more 
quality of heat then the other: but by reason the 
substance of the humor is more subtle and rare, 
the lesse it appeareth: &, as the heat of a flame 
in comparison of the other, more speedily passeth. 
Hitherto haue I declared vnto you all the 
kinds of melancholy, and causes of ech of them: 
hereafter you shall vnderstand, how they worke 
these fearefull effectes in the mind, wherby the 
hart is made heauie, the spirites dulled, the 
cheerfull countenance altered into mourning, 
and life it selfe, which the nature of all thinges 
most desireth, made tedious vnto persons thus 
afflicted. 
 
[}CHAP. IX. 
Howe melancholie worketh fearefull 
passions in the mind.}] 
 
[^p.33^] 
Before I declare vnto you how this humour 
afflicteth the minde: first it shall be necessarie 
for you to vnderstand, what the familiaritie 
is betwixt mind and bodie: howe it affecteth it, 
and how it is affected of it againe. You knowe, 
God first created all things subiect to the course 
of times, and corruption of the earth, after that 
hee had distinguished the confused masse of 
thinges, into the heauens, & the foure elements. 
This earth he had endued with a fecunditie of 
infinite seeds of all things: which he commaunded 
it, as a mother, to bring forth, and as it is 
most agreable to their nature, to entertaine with 
nourishme~t, that which it had borne, & brought 
forth: whereby when he had all the furniture of 
this inferiour worlde, of these creatures, some he 
fixed there still, and maintaineth the seedes, till 
the end of al thinges, and that determinate time, 
which he hath ordained, for the emptying of 
those seedes of creatures, which he first indued 
the earth withall. Other some, that is to say, the 
animals, hee drewe wholly from the earth at the 
beginning, and planted seede in them onely, and 
food from other creatures: as beasts, and man in 
respect of his bodie: the difference only this: that 
likely it is, mans body was made of purer mould, 
as a most pretious tabernacle and temple, wherin 
the image of god should afterward be inshrined: 
and being formed as it were by Gods proper 
hand, receaued a greater dignitie of beautie, 
and proportion, and stature erect: therby to be 
put in mind whither to direct the religious seruice 
of his Creator. This tabernacle thus 
wrought, as the grosse part yeelded a masse for 
[^p.34^] 
the proportion to be framed of: so had it by the 
blessing of God, before inspired, a spirituall 
thing of greater excellencie, then the redde 
earth, which offered it self to the eye only. This 
is that which Philosophers call the spirit: which 
spirit, so prepareth that worke to the receauinge 
of the soule, that with more agrement, the soule, 
and bodie, haue growne into acquaintance: and 
is ordained of God, as it were a true loue knot, 
to couple heauen & earth together; yea a more 
diuine nature, then the heauens with a base clod 
of earth: which otherwise woulde neuer haue 
growen into societie: and hath such indifferent 
affection vnto both, that it is to both equally affected, 
and communicateth the bodie and corporall 
things with the minde, and spirituall, and 
intelligible things, after a sort with the bodie: sauing 
sometimes by vehemency of eithers actio~, 
they seeme to be distracted, and the minde to 
neglect the body: and the body and bodily actions 
common with other creatures, to refuse 
as it were for a moment that communitie wherby 
it commeth to passe, that in vehement contemplations, 
men see not, that which is before 
their eyes: neither heare, though noyse beat the 
aire and sound: nor feele, which at other time 
(such bent of the minde being remitted) they 
should perceaue the sence of, with pleasure or 
paine. This spirit is the chiefe instrument, and 
immediate, whereby the soule bestoweth the excercises 
of her facultie in her body, that passeth 
to and fro in a moment, nothing in swiftnes & 
nimblenes being comparable thereunto: which 
when it is depraued by anie occasion, either rising 
[^p.35^] 
from the bodie: or by other meanes, then 
becometh it an instrument vnhansome for performance 
of such actio~s, as require the vse therof: 
and so the minde seemeth to be blame worthy: 
wherein it is blamelesse: and faultie of certaine 
actions imputed thereunto: wherein the 
body and this spirite are rather to be charged, 
thinges corporall and earthly: the one, in substance, 
and the other in respect of that mixture, 
wherewith the Lord tempered the whole masse 
in the beginning. And that you may haue greater 
assurance in reason of this corporall inclination 
of spirit, consider how it is nourished: and 
with more euide~ce, it shal so appeare vnto you. 
It is maintained by nourishments, whether they 
be of the vegetable, or animall kind: which creatures, 
affoord not only their corporall substance; 
but a spirituall matter also: wherewith euerye 
nourishment, more or lesse is indued: this spirite 
of theirs, is (as similitude of nature, more nighly 
approcheth) altered more speedely, or with larger 
trauell of nature. Of all things of ordinary 
vse, the most speedy alteration is of wine: which 
in a moment repaireth our spirits, and reuiueth 
vs againe, being spent with heauinesse: or any otherwise 
whatsoeuer, our naturall spirites being 
diminished: which bread, and flesh, doth in longer 
time: being of slower passage, and their spirites 
not so subtile, or at least fettred as it were 
in a more grosse body: and without this spirite, 
no creature could giue vs sustentation. For it is a 
knot, to ioyne both our soules and bodies together; 
so nothing of other nature can haue corporall 
coniunction with vs; except their spirites 
[^p.36^] 
with ours first growe into acquaintance: which 
is more speedily done a great deale, then the increase 
of the firme substance: which you may euidently 
perceaue in that we are ready to faint, 
for want of foode; after a litle taken into the stomach 
of refreshing, before anie concoction can 
be halfe reformed, the strength returneth, and 
the spirit reuiueth, and sufficient contentment 
seemeth to be giuen to nature: which notwithstanding, 
not fully so satisfied, prepareth farther 
the aliment of firme substance, & spirits of purer 
sort, for the continuall supply of those ingenerate, 
for sence & motion, life & nourishme~t. 
Nowe although these spirites rise from earthlie 
creatures; yet are they more excellent, then 
earth, or the earthie parts of those natures, from 
which they are drawne; and rise from that diuine 
influence of life, and are not of them selues 
earthie: neither yet comparable in purenes and 
excellencie, vnto that breath of life, wherewith 
the Lord made Adam a liuing soule, which proceeded 
not from any creature, that he had before 
made, as the life of beasts and trees, but immediatly 
from him selfe, representing in some 
part the character of his image. So then these 
three we haue in our nature to consider distinct, 
for the clearer vnderstanding of that I am to intreate 
of: the bodie of earth: the spirit from vertue 
of that spirit, which did as it were hatch that 
great egge of Chaos: & the soule inspired from 
God, a nature eternall and diuine, not fettered 
with the bodie, as certaine Philosophers haue 
taken it: but handfasted therwith, by that golden 
claspe of the spirit: whereby, one, (till the 
[^p.37^] 
predestinate time be expired, and the bodie become 
vnmeete for so pure a spouse) ioyeth at, 
and taketh liking of the other. Nowe as it is not 
possible to passe from one extreme to an other, 
but by a meane; & no meane is there in the nature 
of man, but spirit: by this only the body affecteth 
the mind: and the body and spirits affected, 
partly by disorder, and partly through outward 
occasions, minister discontentment as it 
were to the minde: and in the ende breake that 
bande of fellowship, wherewith they were both 
linked together. This affecting of the minde, I 
vnderstand not to bee any empairing of the nature 
thereof; or decay of any facultie therein; or 
shortning of immortalitie; or any such infirmitie 
inflicted vpon the soule from the body (for it is 
farre exempt from all such alteration): but such 
a disposition, and such discontentment, as a false 
stringed lute, giueth to the musician: or a rough 
and euill fashioned pen, to the cunning writer: 
which only obscureth, the shew of either art, & 
nothing diminisheth of that faculty, which with 
better instruments, would fully content the eye 
with a faire hand; & satisfie the eare with moste 
pleasant and delectable harmonie. Otherwise 
the soule receaueth no hurt from the bodie; it 
being spirituall, and voyde of all passion of corporall 
thinges; and the other grosse, earthie, and 
far vnable to annoy a nature of such excellency. 
 
[}CHAP. X. 
How the bodie affecteth the soule.}] 
 
IN this sort then are you to conceaue me, touching 
[^p.38^] 
those actions, which the bodie seemeth 
to offer violence to the soule; in that no alteration 
of substance, or nature, can rise there from, 
nor anie blemish of naturall facultie, or decaye 
of such qualities, as are essentiall vnto the soule: 
otherwise, might it in the end perish, & destroy 
that immortall nature; which can not by anye 
meanes decaye, but by the same power which 
created it. But thus onely doe (as I may so call 
them) passions force the soule; eue~ through the 
euill disposed instrument of the bodie, they depraue 
the most excellent and most perfect actions, 
whereto the soule is bent in the whole order 
of mans nature, and by corruption of the 
Spirites, which should be the sacred band of vnitie, 
cause such mislike, as the soule, without that 
mediatio~, disdaineth the bodies longer fellowship, 
and betaketh it selfe, to that contemplation, 
whereto it is by nature inclyned; and giueth 
ouer the grosse, and mechanicall actions of the 
bodie, whereto, by order of creation, it was allotted 
in the earthly tabernacle.
