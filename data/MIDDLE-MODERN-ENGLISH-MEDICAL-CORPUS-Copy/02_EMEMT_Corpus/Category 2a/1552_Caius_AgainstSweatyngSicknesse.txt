MAN beyng borne 
not for his owne vse 
and co~moditie alone, 
but also for the commo~ 
benefite of many, 
(as reason wil and al 
good authoures write) he whiche in 
this world is worthy to lyue, ought al 
wayes to haue his hole minde and intente 
geuen to profite others. Whiche 
thynge to shewe in effecte in my 
selfe, although by fortune some waies 
I haue ben letted, yet by that whiche 
fortune cannot debarre, some 
waies again I haue declared. For after 
certein yeres beyng at cambrige, I 
of the age of .xx. yeres, partly for mine 
exercise and profe what I coulde do, 
but chefely for certein of my very fre~des, 
dyd translate out of Latine into 
Englishe certein workes, hauyng nothynge 
els so good to gratifie theim 
w=t= .Wherof one of S. Chrysostome de 
modo orandi deum, that is, of y=e= manner 
[^f.4r^] 
to praye to god, I sent to one my 
frende then beyng in the courte. One 
other, a woorke of Erasmus de vera 
theologia, the true and redy waye to 
reade the scripture, I dyd geue to 
Maister Augustine Stiwarde Alderman 
of Norwiche, not in the ful as the 
authore made it, but abbreuiate for his 
only purpose to whome I sent it, Leuyng 
out many subtile thinges, made 
rather for great & learned diuines, the~ 
for others. The thirde was the paraphrase 
of the same Erasmus vpon the 
Epistle of .S. Jude, whiche I translated 
at the requeste of one other my 
deare frende. 
 
These I did in Englishe the rather 
because at that tyme men ware not so 
geuen all to Englishe, but that they 
dyd fauoure & mayteine good learning 
conteined in tongues & sciences, and 
did also study and apply diligently the 
same the~ selues. Therfore I thought 
no hurte done. Sence y=t= tyme diuerse 
other thynges I haue written, but 
with entente neuer more to write in 
[^f.4v^] 
the Englishe tongue, partly because 
the co~moditie of that which is so written, 
passeth not the compasse of Englande, 
but remaineth enclosed within 
the seas, and partly because I thought 
that labours so taken should be halfe 
loste among them whiche sette not by 
learnyng. Thirdly for that I thought 
it beste to auoide the iudgement of the 
multitude, from whome in maters of 
learnyng a man shalbe forced to dissente, 
in disprouyng that whiche they 
most approue, & approuyng that whiche 
they moste disalowe. Fourthly for 
that the common settyng furthe and 
printi~g of euery foolishe thyng in englishe, 
both of phisicke vnperfectly, and 
other matters vndiscretly, diminishe 
the grace of thynges learned set furth 
in thesame. But chiefely, because I 
wolde geue none example or comforte 
to my countrie men, (who~ I wolde to 
be now, as here tofore they haue bene, 
comparable in learnyng to men of other 
countries) to stonde onely in the 
Englishe tongue, but to leaue the 
[^f.5r^] 
simplicite of thesame, and to procede 
further in many and diuerse knoweleges 
bothe in tongues and sciences at 
home and in vniuersities, to the adournyng 
of the co~mon welthe, better 
seruice of their kyng, & great pleasure 
and commodite of their owne selues, 
to what kinde of life so euer they shold 
applie them. Therfore whatsoeuer 
sence that tyme I minded to write, I 
wrate y=e= same either in greke or latine. 
As firste of all certein commentaries 
vpon certein bokes of William framingha~, 
maister of art in Cambrige, a 
man of great witte, memorie, diligence 
and learnyng, brought vp in thesame 
scholes in Englande that I was, euer 
fro~ his beginnyng vntil his death. Of 
the which bokes .ij. of co~tine~tia (or co~tinence) 
wer in prose, y=e= reste in metre 
or verse of diuerse kindes. One a comforte 
for a blind ma~, entitled ad Aemilianum 
cæcum consolatio, one other 
Ecpyrosis, seu incendiu~ sodomoru~, 
the burnyng of Sodome. The thirde 
Laurentius, expressyng the tormentes 
[^f.5v^] 
of Saincte Laurence. The fourthe, 
Idololatria, Idolatrie, not after the 
trade and veine of scripture (wherein 
he was also very well exercised) but 
conformable to scripture and after the 
ciuile and humane learnyng, declaryng 
them to worshippe Mars, that 
warre, or fight: Venus, that lyue incontinently: 
Pluto, that folowe riches 
couetousely: and so forth through all 
vices vsed in his time. The fiueth boke 
Arete, vertue: the sixth, Epigra~mes, 
conteined in two bokes, whiche by an 
epistle of his owne hand before y=e= boke 
yet remainyng, he dedicated vnto me, 
purposyng to haue done many more 
prety thynges, but that cruell death 
preue~ted, and toke him away wher he 
and I was borne at Norwiche, in the 
yere of our Lord M.d.xxxvij. the xxix 
daie of September, beynge then of the 
age of .xxv. yeres, vij. Monethes, and 
vj. daies, a greate losse of so notable a 
yonge man. These workes at his death 
he willed to comme to my handes, by 
which occasion after I had viewed the~ 
[^f.6r^] 
and perceiued them ful of al kyndes of 
learnyng, thinkyng the~ no workes for 
all me~ to vnderstande with out helpe, 
but such as were wel sene in all sortes 
of authours: I endeuoured my selfe 
partely for the helpe of others, & partly 
for mine owne exercise, to declare 
vpon theim the profite of my studie in 
ciuile and humane learnynge, and to 
haue before mine eyes as in a worke 
(which was alwaies my delyght) how 
muche I had profited in the same. 
Thys so done, I ioyned euery of my 
commentaries to euery of hys saied 
bokes, faier written by Nicolas Pergate 
puple to the saied Maister Framyngham, 
myndyng after the iudgement 
of learned men had in thesame, 
to haue set theim furthe in prynte, if it 
had ben so thought good to theim. For 
whyche cause, at my departynge into 
Italie, I put an Epistle before theym 
dedicatorye to the right Reuerend father 
in God Thomas Thirlbye, now 
Bishoppe of Norwiche, because thesame 
maister Framyngham loued hym 
[^f.6v^] 
aboue others. He after my departure 
deliuered the bokes to the reuerende 
father in god Jho~ Skippe, late bishop 
of Hereforde, then to D. Thirtle, tutor 
to the sayd maister framyngha~, fro~ 
him to syr Richard Morisine, now ambassadoure 
for y=e= kinges maiestie with 
the~perour, then to D. Tailour Deane 
of Lincolne, and syr Thomas Smithe, 
secretarie after to y=e= kynges Maiestie, 
all great learned men. Fro~ these to others 
they wente, among whome the 
bokes died, (as I suppose,) or els be 
closely kept, that after my death they 
may be setfurthe in the names of them 
which now haue the~, as their workes. 
Howe soeuer it be, well I knowe that 
at my returne out of Italie (after .vj. 
yeres continuance ther) into Engla~d, 
I coulde neuer vnderstand wher they 
wer, although I bothe diligently and 
desirousely sought the~. After these I 
translated out of Greke into Latine a 
litle boke of Nicephorus, declarynge 
howe a man maye in praiynge confesse 
hym selfe, which after I dyd geue vnto 
[^f.7r^] 
Jho~ Grome bacheler in arte, a yong 
man in yeres, but in witte & learnyng 
for his tyme, of great expectatio~. That 
done I beganne a chronicle of the citie 
of Norwiche, of the beginninge therof 
& thinges done ther fro~ time to time. 
The matere wherof yet rude and vndigested 
lyeth by me, which at laisure 
I minde to polishe, and to make an 
end of that I haue begunne. And to be 
shorte, in phisicke diuerse thynges I 
haue made & settefurth in print bothe 
in Greke and Latine, not mindyng to 
do other wise, as I haue before said, al 
my life: For which cause al these thinges 
I haue rehersed, els superfluous 
in this place. Yet see, meaning now to 
counseill a litle agaynst the sweatyng 
sickenes for helpe also of others, notwithstandyng 
my former purpose, two 
thynges compell me, in writynge therof, 
to returne agayne to Englishe, 
Necessite of the matter, & good wyl to 
my countrie, frendes, & acquaintance, 
whiche here to haue required me, to 
whome I thinke my selfe borne. 
 
[^f.7v^] 
Necessite, for that this disease is almoste 
peculiar vnto vs Englishe men, 
and not common to all men, folowyng 
vs, as the shadowe the body, in all 
countries, albeit not at al times. Therfore 
compelled I am to vse this our 
Englishe tongue as best to be vnderstande, 
and moste nedeful to whome it 
most foloweth, most behoueth to haue 
spedy remedie, and often tymes leaste 
nyghe to places of succourre and comforte 
at lerned mennes handes: and 
leaste nedefull to be setfurthe in other 
tongues to be vnderstand generally of 
all persons, whome it either haunteth 
not at all, or els very seldome, as ones 
in an age. Thinkynge it also better to 
write this in Englishe after mine own 
meanyng, then to haue it translated 
out of my Latine by other after their 
misunderstandyng. 
 
Good wyll to my countrie frendes 
and acquaintance, seynge them wyth 
out defence yelde vnto it, and it ferefully 
to inuade the~, furiousely handle 
them, spedily oppresse them, vnmercyfully 
[^f.8r^] 
choke them, and that in no small 
numbers, and such persons so notably 
noble in birthe, goodly conditions, 
graue sobrietie, singular wisedo~e, and 
great learnynge, as Henry Duke of 
Suffolke, and the lorde Charles his 
brother, as fewe hath bene sene lyke 
of their age: an heuy & pitifull thyng to 
here or see. So that if by onely learned 
men in phisicke & not this waye also it 
should be holpen, it were nedeful almost 
halfe so many learned men to be 
redy in euery toune and citie, as their 
should be sweatynge sicke folkes. Yet 
this notwithstandynge, I wyll euery 
man not to refuse the counseill of the 
present or nighe phisicen learned, who 
maie, accordyng to the place, persone, 
cause, & other circu~stances, geue more 
particular counseil at nede, but in any 
wise exhorte him to seke it with all diligence. 
To this enterprise also amonge 
so many learned men, not a 
litle stirreth me the gentilnes and 
good willes of al sortes of men, which 
I haue well proued heretofore 
[^f.8v^] 
by my other former bokes. Mindynge 
therefore with as good a will to geue 
my counseil in this, and trusting for no 
lesse gentlenes in the same, I wyll 
plainly and in English for their better 
vnderstandynge to whome I write, 
firste declare the beginnynge, name, 
nature, and signes of the sweatynge 
sickenes. Next, the causes of the same. 
And thirdly, how to preserue men fro~ 
it, and remedy them whe~ they haue it. 
 
[/1./] 
In the yere of our Lorde God, M. 
CCCC.lxxxv. shortly after the .vij. 
daye of august, at whiche tyme kynge 
Henry the seuenth arriued at Milford 
in walles, out of Fraunce, and in the 
firste yere of his reigne, ther chaunced 
a disease among the people, lastyng the 
reste of that monethe & all september, 
which for the soubdeine sharpenes and 
vnwont cruelnes passed the pestilence. 
For this commonly geueth .iij. or .iiij. 
often .vij. sumtyme ix. as that firste at 
Athenes whiche Thucidides describeth 
in his seconde boke, sumtyme .xj. 
and sumtyme .xiiij. dayes respecte, to 
[^f.9r^] 
whome it vexeth. But that immediatly 
killed some in opening theire windowes, 
some in plaieng with children in 
their strete dores, some in one hour, 
many in two it destroyed, & at the longest, 
to the~ that merilye dined, it gaue 
a sorowful Supper. As it founde them 
so it toke them, some in sleape some in 
wake, some in mirthe some in care, 
some fasting & some ful, some busy and 
some idle, and in one house sometyme 
three sometime fiue, sometyme seuen 
sometyme eyght, sometyme more some 
tyme all, of the whyche, if the haulfe 
in euerye Towne escaped, it was 
thoughte great fauour. How, or wyth 
what maner it toke them, with what 
grieffe, and accidentes it helde theym, 
herafter the~ I wil declare, whe~ I shal 
come to shewe the signes therof. In 
the mene space, know that this disease 
(because it most did stand in sweating 
from the beginning vntil the endyng) 
was called here, the Sweating sickenesse: 
and because it firste beganne in 
Englande, it was named in other countries, 
[^f.9v^] 
the englishe sweat. Yet some 
coniecture that it, or the like, hath bene 
before seene among the Grekes in the 
siege of Troie. In the~perour Octauius 
warres at Cantabria, called nowe 
Biscaie, in Hispaine: and in the Turkes, 
at the Rhodes. How true that is, 
let the aucthours loke: how true thys 
is, the best of our Chronicles shewith, 
& of the late begonne disease the freshe 
memorie yet confirmeth. But if the 
name wer now to be geuen, and at my 
libertie to make the same: I would of 
the maner and space of the disease (by 
cause the same is no sweat only, as herafter 
I will declare, & in the spirites) 
make the name Ephemera, which is to 
sai, a feuer of one natural dai. A feuer, 
for the feruor or burning, drieth & sweating 
feure like. Of one naturall day, 
for that it lasteth but the time of .xxiiij. 
houres. And for a distinction from 
the commune Ephemera, that Galene 
writeth of, comming both of other causes, 
and wyth vnlike paines, I wold 
putte to it either Englishe, for that it 
[^f.10r^] 
followeth somoche English menne, to 
who~ it is almoste proper, & also began 
here: or els pestilent, for that it co~meth 
by infection & putrefaction, otherwise 
then doth the other Ephemera. Whiche 
thing I suppose may the better be 
done, because I se straunge and no english 
names both in Latine and Greke, 
by commune vsage taken for Englishe. 
As in Latin, Feure, Quotidia~, 
Tertian, Quartane, Aier, Infection, 
Pestilence, Uomite, Person, Reines, 
Ueines, Peines, Chamere, Numbre, 
&c. a litle altered by the commune pronunciation. 
In Greke, Pleuresie, Ischiada, 
Hydrops, Apostema, Phlegma, 
and Chole: called by the vulgare 
pronunciatio~, Schiatica, Dropsie, Impostume, 
Phleume, & Choler: Gyne 
also, and Boutyre, Sciourel, Mouse, 
Rophe, Phrase, Paraphrase, & cephe, 
wherof cometh Chaucers couercephe, 
in the romant of the Rose, writte~ and 
pronou~ced como~ly, kerchief in y=e= south, 
& courchief in the north. Thereof euery 
head or principall thing, is comonlye 
called cephe, pronou~ced & writte~, chief 
[^f.10v^] 
Uery many other there be in our commune 
tongue, whiche here to rehearse 
were to long. These for an example 
shortelye I haue here noted. But for 
the name of this disease it maketh now 
no matter, the name of Sweat beyng 
co~mo~ly vsed. Let vs therfore returne 
to the thing, which as occasio~ & cause 
serued, came againe in the .M.D.vi. 
the .xxii. yeare of the said Kyng Henry 
the seuenth. Aftre that, in the yeare 
M.D.xvii. the .ix. yeare of Kyng 
Henry the .viii, and endured from July, 
vnto y=e= middest of Dece~bre. The .iiii 
tyme, in the yeare .M.D.xxviii. the 
xx. yeare of thesaied Kyng, beginning 
in thende of May, & continuing June 
and July. The fifth tyme of this fearful 
Ephemera of Englande, and pestilent 
sweat, is this in the yeare .M.D. 
LI. of oure Lorde GOD, and the 
fifth yeare of oure Souereigne Lorde 
king Edwarde the sixth, beginning at 
Shrewesbury in the middest of April, 
proceadinge with greate mortalitie to 
Ludlowe, Prestene, and other places 
[^f.11r^] 
in Wales, then to Westchestre, Couentre, 
Oxenfoorde, and other tounes 
in the Southe, and such as were in 
and aboute the way to London, whether 
it came notablie the seuenth of 
July, and there continuing sore, with 
the losse of .vii.C.lxi. from the .ix. day 
vntil the .xvi. daye, besides those that 
died in the .vii. and .viii. dayes, of who~ 
no registre was kept, fro~ that it abated 
vntil the xxx. day of the same, with the 
losse of .C.xlii. more. Then ceassing 
there, it wente from thence throughe 
al the east partes of England into the 
Northe vntill the ende of Auguste, at 
whiche tyme it diminished, and in the 
ende of Septembre fully ceassed. 
 
This disease is not a Sweat onely, 
(as it is thought & called) but a feuer, 
as I saied, in the spirites by putrefaction 
venemous, with a fight, trauaile, 
and laboure of nature againste the infection 
receyued in the spirites, whervpon 
by chaunce foloweth a Sweate, 
or issueth an humour compelled by nature, 
as also chanceth in other sicknesses 
[^f.11v^] 
whiche consiste in humours, when 
they be in their state, and at the worste 
in certein dayes iudicial, aswel by vomites, 
bledinges, & fluxes, as by sweates. 
That this is true, the self sweates 
do shewe. For as in vtter businesses, 
bodies y=t= sore do labour, by trauail 
of the same are forced to sweat, so in inner 
diseases, the bodies traueiled & labored 
by the~, are moued to the like. In 
which labors, if nature be stro~g & able 
to thrust out the poiso~ by sweat (not otherwise 
letted) y=e= perso~ escapeth: if not, 
it dieth. That it is a feuer, thus I haue 
partly declared, and more wil streight 
by the notes of the disease, vnder one 
shewing also by thesame notes, signes, 
and short tariance of the same, that it 
consisteth in the spirites. First by the 
peine in the backe, or shoulder, peine in 
the extreme partes, as arme, or legge, 
with a flusshing, or wind, as it semeth 
to certeine of the pacientes, flieng in 
the same. Secondly by the grief in 
the liuer and the nigh stomacke. Thirdely, 
by the peine in the head, & madnes 
[^f.12r^] 
of the same. Fourthly by the passion 
of the hart. For the flusshing or wynde 
comming in the vtter and extreame 
partes, is nothing els but the spirites 
of those same gathered together, at the 
first entring of the euell aire, agaynste 
the infection therof, & flyeng thesame 
from place to place, for their owne sauegarde. 
But at the last infected, they 
make a grief where thei be forced, which 
co~monly is in tharme or legge (the 
fartheste partes of theire refuge) the 
backe or shulder: trieng ther first a bru~t 
as good souldiers, before they wil let 
their enemye come further into theire 
dominion. The other grefes be therefore 
in thother partes aforsaid & sorer, 
because the spirites be there most ple~tuous 
as in their founteines, whether 
alwaies thinfection desireth to go. For 
fro~ the liuer, the nigh stomack, braine, 
and harte, come all the .iij. sortes, and 
kyndes of spirites, the gouernoures of 
oure bodies, as firste spronge there. 
But from the hart, the liuish spirites. 
In putrifieng wherof by the euel aier 
[^f.12v^] 
in bodies fit for it, the harte is oppressed. 
Wherupon also foloweth a marueilous 
heauinesse, (the fifthe token of 
this disease,) and a desire to sleape, neuer 
contented, the senses in al partes 
beynge as they were bounde or closed 
vp, the partes therfore left heuy, vnliuishe, 
and dulle. Laste foloweth the 
shorte abidinge, a certeine Token of 
the disease to be in the spirites, as wel 
may be proued by the Ephemere that 
Galene writethe of, whiche because it 
consistethe in the Spirites, lasteth but 
one natural day. For as fire in hardes 
or straw, is sone in flambe & sone oute, 
euen so heate in the spirites, either by 
simple distemperature, or by infection 
and putrefaction therin conceyued, is 
sone in flambe and sone out, and soner 
for the vehemencye or greatnes of the 
same, whiche without lingering, consumeth 
sone the light matter, contrary 
to al other diseases restyng in humoures, 
wherin a fire ones kindeled, is not 
so sone put out, no more then is the same 
in moiste woodde, or fat Sea coles, 
[^f.13r^] 
as well by the particular Example of 
the pestilence, (of al others most lyke 
vnto this) may be declared, whyche by 
that it sta~deth in euel humors, tarieth 
as I said, sometyme, from .iiij. vii. ix. & 
xj. vntill .xiiij. dayes, differentlie from 
this, by reason therof, albeit by infection 
most lyke to this same. Thus 
vnder one laboure shortelie I haue declared, 
bothe what this disease is, 
wherein it consisteth, howe and with 
what accidentes it grieueth and is differente 
from the Pestilence; and the 
propre signes, and tokens of the same, 
without the whiche, if any do sweate, 
I take theym not to Sweate by this 
Sickenesse, but rather by feare, heate 
of the yeare, many clothes, greate exercise, 
affection, excesse in diete, or at 
the worst, by a smal cause of infection, 
and lesse disposition of the bodi to this 
sicknes. So that, insomoche as the body 
was nat al voide of matter, sweate 
it did when infection came: but in that 
the mattere was not greate, the same 
coulde neyther be perilous nor paineful 
[^f.13v^] 
as in others, in whom it was greater 
cause. 
 
Hetherto I haue shewed the beginning, 
[/2./] 
name, nature, & signes of this disease: 
nowe I will declare the causes, 
which be .ij: infectio~, & impure spirites 
in bodies corrupt by repletio~. Infection, 
by thaire receiuing euel qualities, 
diste~pring not only y=e= hete, but the hole 
substa~ce therof, in putrifieng thesame, 
and that generally ij. waies. By the time 
of the yere vnnatural, & by the nature 
& site of the soile & region, wherunto 
maye be put the particular accidentes 
of this same. By the time of the yeare 
vnnaturall, as if winter be hot & drie, 
somer hot and moist: (a fit time for sweates) 
the spring colde and drye, the fall 
hot & moist. To this mai be ioyned the 
euel disposition by constellation, whiche 
hath a great power & dominion in 
al erthly thinges. By the site & nature 
of the soile & regio~, many wayes. First 
& specially by euel mistes & exhalatio~s 
drawen out of the grounde by the su~ne 
in the heate of the yeare, as chanced amo~g 
the Grekes in the siege of Troy, 
[^f.14r^] 
wherby died firste dogges & mules, after, 
me~ in great numbre: & here also in 
Engla~d in this m.d.lj. yeare, the cause 
of this pestilent sweate, but of dyuers 
nature. Whiche miste in the countrie 
wher it began, was sene flie fro~ toune 
to toune, with suche a stincke in morninges 
& eueninges, that me~ could scarcely 
abide it. The~ by dampes out of the 
earth, as out of Galenes Barathru~, or 
the poetes auernu~, or aornu~, the dampes 
wherof be such, that thei kil y=e= birdes 
flie~g ouer them. Of like dampes, I 
heard in the north cou~try in cole pits, 
wherby the laboring me~ be streight killed, 
except before the houre of coming 
therof (which thei know by y=e= flame of 
their ca~dle) thei auoid the grou~d. Thirdly 
by putrefactio~ or rot in grou~des aftre 
great flouddes, in carions, & in dead 
men. After great fluddes, as happened 
in y=e= time of Gallien the~peror at rome, 
in Achaia & Libia, wher the seas sodeinly 
did ouerflow y=e= cities nigh to y=t= same. 
And in the .xi. yeare of Pelagius, 
when al the flouddes throughe al Italye 
didde rage, but chieflye Tibris at 
[^f.14v^] 
Rome, whiche in many places was 
as highe as the walles of the citie. 
 
In cario~s or dead bodies, as fortuned 
here in Englande vpon the sea banckes 
in the tyme of King Alured, or 
Alfrede, (as some Chroniclers write) 
but in the time of king Ethelred after 
Sabellicus, by occasion of drowned 
Locustes cast vp by the Sea, which by 
a wynde were driuen oute of Fraunce 
thether. This locust is a flie in bignes 
of a ma~nes thumbe, in colour broune, 
in shape somewhat like a greshopper, 
hauing .vi. fiete, so many wynges, two 
tiethe, & an hedde like a horse, and therfore 
called in Italy Caualleto, where 
ouer y=e= city of Padoa, in the yeare m.d 
xlij. (as I remembre,) I, with manye 
more did see a swarme of theim, whose 
passage ouer the citie, did laste two 
hours, in breadth inestimable to euery 
man there. Here by example to note 
infection by deadde menne in Warres, 
either in rotting aboue the ground, as 
chaunced in Athenes by theim of Ethiopia, 
or els in beyng buried ouerly 
[^f.15r^] 
as happened at Bulloigne, in the yere 
M.D.xlv. the yeare aftre king Henrye 
theight had conquered the same, or 
by long continuance of an hoste in one 
place; it is more playne by dayly experience, 
then it neadeth to be shewed. 
Therefore I wil now go to the fourth 
especial cause of infectio~, the pent aier, 
breaking out of the ground in yearthquakes, 
as chaunced at Uenice in the 
first yeare of Andrea Dandulo, then 
Duke, the .xxiiii. day of Januarye, and 
xx. hour after their computacion. By 
which infectio~ mani died, & many were 
borne before their time. The v. cause 
is close, & vnstirred aire, & therfore putrified 
or corrupt, out of old welles, holes 
in y=t= grou~d made for grain, wherof 
many I did se in & about Pesaro in Italy, 
by openi~g the~ aftre a great space, 
as both those cou~trime~ do co~fesse, & also 
by exa~ple is declared, for y=e= manye in 
openi~g the~ vnwarely be killed. Out of 
caues, & to~bes also, as chau~ced first in 
the country of Babilonia, proceding aftre 
into Grece, and so to Rome, by occasion 
[^f.15v^] 
that y=e= souldiers of themperour 
Marcus Antoninus, vpon hope of money, 
brake up a golden coffine of Auidius 
Cassius, spie~g a litle hole therin, 
in the te~ple of Apollo in Seleucia, as 
Ammianus Marcellinus writeth. To 
these mai be ioyned the particular causes 
of infectio~, which I cal the accidentes 
of the place, augmenting the same. 
As nigh to dwelling places, merishe, & 
muddy groundes, puddles or donghilles, 
sinkes or canales, easing places or 
carions, deadde ditches or rotten groundes, 
close aier in houses or ualleis, 
with suche like. Thus muche for the 
firste cause. 
 
The second cause of this Englyshe 
Ephemera, I said were thimpure spirites 
in bodies corupt by repletio~. Repletion 
I cal here, abundance of humores 
euel & maliciouse, from long time 
by litle & litle gathered by euel diete, 
remaining in the bodye, coming either 
by to moche meate, or by euel meate in 
qualitie, as infected frutes, meates of 
euel iuse or nutrime~t; or both ioyntly. 
[^f.16r^] 
To such spirites when the aire infectiue 
cometh co~sonant, the~ be thei diste~pered, 
corrupted, sore handled, & oppressed, 
the~ nature is forced, & the disease 
engendred. But while I doe declare 
these impure spirites to be one cause, 
I must remoue your myndes fro~ spirites 
to humours, for that the spirites be 
fedde of the fiuest partes therof, & aftre 
bringe you againe to spirites where I 
toke you. And forsomuche as I haue 
not yet forgotten to whome I write, in 
this declaration I will leaue a part al 
learned & subtil reaso~s, as here void & 
vnmiete, & only vse suche as be most euident 
to whom I write, & easiest to be 
vnderstanden of the same: and at ones 
therwith shew also why it hau~teth vs 
English men more the~ other nations. 
Therfore I passe ouer the vnge~tle sauoure 
or smell of the sweate, grosenes, 
colour, and other qualities of the 
same, the quantitie, the daunger in 
stopping, the maner in coming furthe 
redily, or hardly, hot or cold, the notes 
in the excreme~tes, the state longer or 
[^f.16v^] 
sorer, with suche others, which mai be 
toke~s of corrupt humours & spirites, & 
onli wil sta~d upo~ .iii. reaso~s declaring y=e= 
same swet by gret repletio~ to be in vs 
not otherwise for al y=e= euel aire apt to 
this disease, more the~ other natio~s. For 
as hereaftre I wil shew, & Gale~ co~firmeth, 
our bodies ca~ not suffre any thi~g 
or hurt by corrupt & infectiue causes, 
except ther be in the~ a certei~ mater prepared 
apt & like to receiue it, els if one 
were sick, al shuld be sick, if in this countri, 
in al cou~tres wher the infection 
came, which thi~g we se doth not cha~ce. 
For touching the first reaso~, we se this 
sweting sicknes or pestile~t Ephemera, 
to be oft in Engla~d, but neuer entreth 
Scotland, (except the borders) albeit 
thei both be ioinctly within the co~pas 
of on sea. The same beginning here, hath 
assailed Brabant & the costes nigh to 
it, but neuer passed Germany, where 
ones it was in like facio~ as here, with 
great mortalitie, in the yere .m.d.xxix. 
Cause wherof none other there is naturall, 
then the euell diet of these thre 
[^f.17r^] 
contries whiche destroy more meates 
and drynckes withoute al ordre, co~uenie~t 
time, reaso~, or necessite, the~ either 
Scotlande, or all other countries vnder 
the sunne, to the greate annoiance 
of their owne bodies and wittes, hinderance 
of theim which have nede, and 
great dearth and scarcitie in their co~mon 
welthes. Wherfore if Esculapius 
the inuentour of phisike, y=e= sauer of me~ 
from death, and restorer to life, should 
returne again i~to this world, he could 
not saue these sortes of men, hauing so 
moche sweatyng stuffe, so many euill 
humoures laid vp in store, fro~ this displeasante, 
feareful, & pestilent disease: 
except thei would learne a new lesson, 
& folowe a new trade. For other wise, 
neither the auoidyng of this countrie 
(the seconde reason) nor fleyng into others, 
(a commune refuge in other 
diseases) wyll preserue vs Englishe 
men, as in this laste sweate is by experience 
well proued in Cales, Antwerpe, 
and other places of Brabant, 
wher only our contrimen waxe sicke, 
[^f.17v^] 
& none others, except one or ii. others 
of thenglishe diete, which is also to be 
noted. The cause hereof natural is 
onely this, that they caried ouer with 
the~, & by lyke diete ther incresed that 
whiche was the cause of their disease. 
Wherefore lette vs asserteine our 
selues, that in what soeuer contrie 
lyke cause and matter is, there commyng 
like aier and cause efficient, wil 
make lyke effecte and disease in perso~s 
of agreable complexions, age, and 
diete, if the tyme also doe serue to 
these same, and in none others. These 
I putte, for that the tyme of the yere 
hote, makethe moche to the malice of 
the disease, in openynge the pores of 
the body, lettynge in the euill aier, 
resoluynge the humores and makynge 
them flowable, and disposing therfore 
the spirites accordyngly, besyde, 
that (as I shewed in the first cause of 
this pestilente sweate) it stirreth and 
draweth out of the erthe euill exhalations 
and mistes, to thinfection of the 
aier and displeasure of vs. Diet I put, 
[^f.18r^] 
for that they of the contrarie diete be 
not troubled with it at all. Age and 
complexion, for this, that although it 
spareth no~ age of bothe kyndes, nor no 
complexion but some it touchethe, yet 
for the most parte (wherby rules and 
reasones be alwayes to be made) it 
vexed theim of the middle age, beste 
luste, and theim not moche vnder that, 
and of complexions hote & moiste, as 
fitteste by their naughty & moche subtiltie 
of blode to fede the spirites: or 
nigh and lyke to thesame in some one 
of the qualities, as cholerike in hete, 
phlegmatike in moister, excepte thother 
their qualities, as drinesse in cholerike, 
& cold in phlegmatike, by great 
dominion ouer thother, did lette. For 
the clene contrarie complexio~s to the 
infected aier, alwaies remaine helthful, 
saulfe and better then tofore, the 
corrupte and infected aier notwithstandyng. 
Therfore cold and drie persones 
either it touched not at all, or 
very fewe, and that wyth no danger: 
such I say as beside their complexion, 
[^f.18v^] 
(whiche is so harde to finde in any 
man exacte and simple, as exacte helthes) 
were annoied with some corrupt 
humoures & spirites, & therfore mete 
by so moch to receiue it, & that by good 
reaso~. For nothing can naturally haue 
power to do ought against any thing, 
excepte the same haue in it selfe a disposicion 
by like qualities to receiue it. 
As the cause in the fote ca~not trouble 
the flanke and leue the knee (the mean 
betwixte) except there were a greater 
consent and likenes of nature in sufferance 
(whiche we call sympathian) 
betwixte those then thother. Nor fire 
refusynge stones, canne burne hardes, 
strawe, stickes and charcole, oile, waxe, 
fatte, and seacole, except these same 
first of al wer apte, and by conuenient 
qualities disposed to be enflamed and 
burned. Nor any man goeth about to 
burne water, because the qualities 
thereof be contrary, and the body vndisposed 
to the like of fire. By whiche 
reason it may also be perceiued, that y=e= 
venemouse qualitie of this corrupt 
[^f.19r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.20.^] 
is hote and moiste, for it redily enfectethe 
the lyke complexions, and those 
nigh vnto theim, and the contrary not 
at all, or hardly: & easely doth putrify, 
as doe the Southe wyndes. Therfore 
next vnto those colde and drie co~plexions, 
olde men escaped free, as 
like to theim by age: and children, as 
voide of replecion consumed by their 
great hete, and therefore alwaies redy 
to eate. But in this disease the subtile 
humour euill and abundant in full 
bodies fedyng y=e= spirites, is more to be 
noted then the humour complexional, 
whiche notwithstanding, as an helper 
or hinderer to y=e= same, is not to be neglected. 
For els it should be in all contries 
and persones indifferently, wher 
all complexiones be. The thirde and 
laste reason is, y=t= they which had thys 
sweat sore with perille or death, were 
either men of welthe, ease, & welfare, 
or of the poorer sorte such as wer idle 
persones, good ale drinkers, and Tauerne 
haunters. For these, by y=e= great 
welfare of the one sorte, and large 
[^f.19v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.20.^] 
drinkyng of thother, heped vp in their 
bodies moche euill matter: by their 
ease and idlenes, coulde not waste and 
consume it. A comfirmacion of this is, 
that the laborouse and thinne dieted 
people, either had it not, because they 
dyd eate but litle to make the matter: 
or with no greate grefe and danger, 
because they laboured out moche 
thereof. Wherefore vpon small cause, 
necessarily must folowe a smal effecte. 
All these reasones go to this ende, that 
persones of all contries of moderate 
and good diete, escape thys Englishe 
Ephemera, and those be onely vexed 
therewith, whiche be of immoderate 
and euill diete. But why? for the euill 
humores and corrupte aier alone? No. 
for the~ the pestilence and not the swet 
should rise. For what then? For y=e= impure 
spirites corrupte in theim selues 
and by the infectiue aier. Why so? 
for that of impure and corrupte humores, 
whether thei be blode or others, 
can rise none other then impure spirites. 
For euery thynge is suche as that 
[^f.20r^] 
whereof it commeth. Now, that of 
the beste and fineste of the blode, yea 
in corrupte bodies (whyche beste is 
nought) these spirites be ingendred 
and fedde, I before expressed. Therfor 
who wyl haue them pure and cleane, 
and him selfe free from sweat, muste 
kepe a pure and cleane diete, and then 
he shalbe sure. 
 
Infection by the aier, and impure 
[/3./] 
spirites by repletion thus founde and 
declared to be the causes of this pestilente 
sweate or Englishe ephemera, 
lette vs nowe see howe we maye preserue 
our selues from it, and howe it 
may be remedied, if it chaunce, wyth 
lesse mortalitie. I wyll begynne wyth 
preseruation. That most of all dothe 
stande in auoidyng the causes to come 
of the disease, the thinges helping forward 
the same, & remouyng that whiche 
is alredy had & gotten. Al be done 
by the good order of thynges perteynyng 
to the state of the body. Therfore 
I will begin with diete wher I lefte, 
& then go furth with aier where I beganne 
[^f.20v^] 
in treatyng the causes, and declare the 
waie to auoide infection, and so furthe 
to the reste in order. Who that 
lustethe to lyue in quiete suretie, out 
of the sodaine danger of this Englishe 
ephemera, he aboue all thynges, of 
litle and good muste eate & spare not. 
the laste parte wherof wyl please well 
(I doubt not) vs Englishe men: the 
firste I thinke neuer a deale. Yet it 
must please theim that entende to lyue 
without the reche of this disease. So 
doyng, they shall easely escape it. For 
of that is good, can be engendred no 
euill: of that is litle, can be gathered 
no great store. Therfore helthful must 
he nedes be and free from this disease, 
that vsethe this kinde of liuynge and 
maner in dietynge. An example hereof 
may the wise man Socrates be, which 
by this sorte of diete escaped a sore pestilence 
in Athenes, neuer fleynge ne 
kepyng close him selfe from the same. 
Truly who will lyue accordynge to 
nature and not to lust, may with this 
diete be well contented. For nature is 
[^f.21r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.22.^] 
pleased with a litle, nor seketh other 
then that the mind voide of cares and 
feares may be in quiete merily, and the 
body voide of grefe, maye be in life 
swetly, as Lucretius writeth. Here 
at large to ronne out vntill my breth 
wer spent, as vpon a common place, against 
y=e= intempera~ce or excessiue diete 
of Englande, thincommodities & displeasures 
of the same many waies: and 
contrarie, in comme~dation of meane 
diete and temperance (called of Plato 
sophrosyne, for that it co~serneth wisdome) 
and the thousande commodities 
therof, both for helthe, welthe, witte, 
and longe life, well I might, & lose my 
laboure: such be our Englishe facions 
rather then reasones. But for that I 
purpose neither to wright a longe 
worke but a shorte counseill, nor to 
wery the reders with that they luste 
not to here, I will lette that passe, and 
moue the~ that desire further to knowe 
my mynde therin, to remember that 
I sayd before, of litle & good eate and 
spare not, wherby they shall easely 
[^f.21v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.22.^] 
perceiue my meanyng. I therefore go 
furth with my diete, wherin my counseill 
is, that the meates be helthfull, 
and holsomly kylled, swetly saued, 
and wel prepared in rostyng, sethyng, 
baking, & so furth. The bred, of swet 
corne, wel leuened, and so baked. The 
drinke of swete malte and good water 
kyndly brued, without other drosse 
nowe a daies vsed. No wine in all the 
tyme of sweatyng, excepte to suche 
whose sickenes require it for medicin, 
for fere of inflamynge & openynge, nor 
except y=e= halfe be wel soden water. In 
other tymes, old, pure, & smal. Wishi~g 
for the better executio~ hereof & ouersight 
of good and helthsome victalles, 
ther wer appointed certein masters of 
helth in euery citie and toune, as there 
is in Italie, whiche for the good order 
in all thynges, maye be in al places an 
example. The meates I would to be 
veale, muttone, kidde, olde lambe, chikyn, 
capone, henne, cocke, pertriche, 
phesane, felfare, smal birdes, pigeon, 
yong pecockes, whose fleshe by a certeine 
[^f.22r^] 
natural & secrete propertie neuer 
putrefie, as hath bene proued. Conies, 
porke of meane age, neither fatte nor 
leane, the skynne take~ awaye, roste, & 
eate~ colde: Tartes of prunes, gelies of 
veale & capone. yong befe in this case a 
litle poudered is not to be dispraised, 
nor new egges & good milke. Butter 
in a mornyng with sage and rewe fastynge 
in the sweatynge tyme, is a good 
preseruatiue, beside that it nourisheth. 
Crabbes, crauesses, picrel, perche, 
ruffe, gogion, lampreis out of grauelly 
riuers, smeltes, dace, barbell, gornerd, 
whityng, soles, flunders, plaice, millers 
thumbes, minues w=t= such others, 
sodde in water & vinegre w=t= rosemary 
time, sage, & hole maces, & serued hote. 
Yea swete salte fishe and linge, for the 
saltes sake wastynge y=e= humores therof, 
which in many freshe fishes remaine, 
maye be allowed well watered to 
the~ that haue non other, & wel lyke it. 
Nor all fishes, no more then al fleshes 
be so euil as they be take~ for: as is wel 
declared in physik, & approued by the 
[^f.22v^] 
olde and wise romaines moche in their 
fisshes, lusty chartusianes neuer in 
fleshes, & helthful poore people more 
in fishe then fleshe. But we are nowe 
a daies so vnwisely fine, and womanly 
delicate, that we may in no wise touch 
a fisshe. The olde manly hardnes, 
stoute courage, & peinfulnes of Englande 
is vtterly driuen awaye, in the 
stede wherof, men now a daies receiue 
womanlines, & become nice, not able 
to withstande a blaste of wynde, or resiste 
a poore fishe. And children be so 
brought vp, that if they be not all daie 
by the fire with a toste and butire, and 
in their furres, they be streight sicke. 
 
Sauces to metes I appoint firste aboue 
all thynges good appetite, and 
next Oliues, capers, iuse of lemones, 
Barberies, Pomegranetes, Orenges 
and Sorel, veriuse, & vineigre, iuse of 
vnripe Grapes, thepes or Goseberies. 
After mete, quinces, or marmalade, 
Pomegranates, Orenges sliced eaten 
with Suger, Succate of the pilles or 
barkes therof, and of pomecitres, olde 
[^f.23r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.24.^] 
apples and peres, Prunes, Reisons 
Dates & Nuttes. Figges also, so they 
be taken before diner. els no frutes of 
that yere, nor rawe herbes or rotes in 
sallattes, for that in suche times they 
be suspected to be partakers also of 
the enfected aire. 
 
Of aire so muche I haue spoken before, 
as apperteinethe to the declaration 
of enfection therby. Nowe I wyl 
aduise and counseill howe to kepe the 
same pure, for so moche as may be, or 
lesse enfected, and correcte the same corrupte. 
The first is done in takynge a 
way y=e= causes of enfectio~. The seconde, 
by doynge in all pointes the contrary 
thereto. Take awaye the causes we 
maye, in damnyng diches, auoidynge 
cario~s, lettyng in open aire, shunning 
suche euil mistes as before I spake of, 
not openynge or sturrynge euill brethynge 
places, landynge muddy and 
rotte~ groundes, burieng dede bodyes, 
kepyng canelles cleane, sinkes & easyng 
places sweat, remouynge dongehilles, 
boxe and euil sauouryng thynges, 
[^f.23v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.24.^] 
enhabitynge high & open places, 
close towarde the sowthe, shutte toward 
the winde, as reason wil & thexperience 
of .M. varro in the pestile~ce at 
Corcyra confirmethe. Correcte in doyng 
the contrary we shall, in dryenge 
the moiste with fyres, either in houses 
or chambers, or on that side the cities, 
townes, & houses, that lieth toward 
the infection and wynde commyng together, 
chefely in mornynges & eueninges, 
either by burnyng the stubble 
in the felde, or windfallynges in the 
woodes, or other wise at pleasure. By 
which policie skilful Acron deliuered 
Athenes in Gretia, and diuine Hippocrates 
abdera~ in Thratia fro~ y=e= pestile~ce, 
& preserued fro~ the same other the 
cities in Grece, at diuerse times co~yng 
with the wynde fro~ æthiopia illyria 
& pæonia, by putting to the fires wel 
smelling garla~des, floures & odoures, 
as Galene and Soranus write. Of like 
pollicie for purgyng the aier were the 
bonfires made (as I suppose) fro~ long 
time hetherto vsed in y=e= middes of sommer, 
[^f.24r^] 
and not onely for vigiles. In co~fortyng 
the spirites also, and by alterynge 
the aier with swete odoures of 
roses, swet perfumes of the same, rosemary 
leaues, baies, and white sanders 
cutte, afewe cloues steped in rose water 
and vinegre rosate, the infection 
shalbe lesse noious. With the same you 
maye also make you a swete house in 
castynge it abrode therin, if firste by 
auoidynge the russhes and duste, you 
make the house clene. Haue alwaies 
in your handcercher for your nose and 
mouth, bothe with in your house aud 
without, either the perfume before 
saide, or vinegre rosate: and in your 
mouth a pece either of setwel, or of the 
rote of enula campana wel steped before 
in vinegre rosate, a mace, or berie 
of Iuniper. In wante of suche perfumes 
as is beforesaide, take of mirrhe & 
drie rose leues of eche a lyke quantite, 
with a little franke encense, for the like 
purpose, and caste it vpon the coles: or 
burne Juniper & their beries. And for 
so moche as clenelines is a great help 
[^f.24v^] 
to helthe, mine aduise is, that all your 
clothes be swete smellynge and clene, 
and that you wasshe your handes and 
face not in warme water, but with 
rose water and vinegre rosate colde, 
or elles with the faire water and vinegre 
wherein the pilles or barkes of 
orenges and pomegranates are sodden: 
or the pilles of pomecitres & sorel 
is boiled. for so you shalle close the 
pores ayenst the ayre, that it redily 
entre not, and cole and tempre those 
partes so wasshed, accordynge to the 
right entente in curynge this disease. 
For in al the discurse, preseruatio~, and 
cure of thys disease, the chefe marke & 
purpose is, to minister suche thynges 
as of their nature haue the facultie by 
colyng dryenge and closyng, to resiste 
putrefaction, strength and defende the 
spirites, comforte the harte, and kepe 
all the body ayenst the displeasure of 
the corrupte aire. Wherfor it shal be 
wel done, if you take of this co~position 
folowyng euery mornyng the weight 
of .ij. d. in .vi. sponefulles of water 
[^f.25r^] 
or iuleppe of Sorel, & cast it vpon your 
meate as pepper. +R sei~s citri, acetos, 
ros. rub, sa~dal. citrin. a~n. +Q. i, boli 
armeni orie~tal. +Q. i. s, terr. sigil. +Q s, 
margarit. +Q. i, fol. auri puri. n=o=. iiii, 
misce. & f. pul. diuidatur ad po~d. +Q. s. 
Or in the stede of this, take fasting the 
quantitie of a small bene of Mithridatum 
or Uenice triacle in a sponeful of 
Sorel, or Scabious water, or by the 
selfe alone. And in goyng abrode, haue 
in youre hande either an handekercher 
with vinegre and rose water, or a litle 
muske balle of nutmegges, maces, cloues, 
saffro~, & cinamome, of eche the weight 
of .ii. d. finely beate~. of mastike the 
weight of .ij. d. ob. of storax .v. d. of ladane 
.x. d. of Ambre grise .vi. graines, of 
Muske .iii. graines dissolued in ryght 
Muscadel: temper al together, & make 
a balle. In want of Mithridatum or 
suche other as I haue before mencioned, 
vse dayly the Sirupes of Pomegranates, 
Lemones, and Sorell, of 
eche half an vnce, with asmuche of the 
watres of Tormentille, Sorell, and 
[^f.25v^] 
Dragones, fasting in the morning, and 
one houre before supper. A toste in vinegre 
or veriuse of Grapes, with a litle 
poulder of Cinamome and Settewelle 
caste vppon it. Or two figges 
with one nutte carnelle, and tenne leaues 
of rue in eche, and a litle salt. Or 
boutire, rue, and sage, with breade in a 
morning eaten nexte your harte, be as 
good preseruatiues, as theie be easye 
to be hadde. These preseruatiues 
I here appoincte the more willingly 
among many others further to be 
fetched, because these maye easelier be 
hadde, as at hande in niede, which now 
to finde is my most endeuour, as moste 
fruictfulle to whome I write. And 
this to be done I counsaille in the 
sickenesse tyme, when firste you heare 
it to be comming and begonne, but 
not in the fitte. Alwayes remembryng, 
not to go out fastinge. For as 
Cornelius Celsus wrytethe, Uenime 
or infection taketh holde muche soner 
in a bodye yet fasting, then in the same 
not fastinge. Yet this is not so to be 
[^f.26r^] 
vnderstande, that in the mornynge 
we shal streight as our clothes be on, 
stuffe our bellies as fulle as Englishe 
menne, (as the Frenche man saieth to 
our shames,) but to be contente with 
oure preseruatiues, or with a little meate 
bothe at breakefaste (if custome and 
nede so require) dynner and supper. 
For other wise nature, if the disease 
shoulde take vs, shoulde haue more a 
doe againste the full bealy and fearce 
disease, then it were able to susteyne. 
 
Aftre diete and ayer followethe filling 
or emptieng. Of filling in the name 
of repletio~ I spake before. Of e~ptieng, 
I will now shortely write as of a 
thing very necessary for the conseruation 
of mannes healthe. For if that 
whiche is euel within, be not by good 
meanes & wayes wel fet oute, it often 
times destroyeth the lyfe. Good meanes 
to fet out the euelle stuffe of the 
body be two, abstinence, & auoydance. 
 
Abstinence, in eatynge and drinckynge 
litle, as a lytle before I sayed, 
[^f.26v^] 
and seldome. For so, more goeth awaie 
then comethe, and by litle and litle it 
wasteth the humours & drieth. Therfore 
(as I wiene) throughe the counseil 
of Phisike, & by the good ciuile, 
& politique ordres, te~dring the wealth 
of many so much geue~ to their bellies 
to their own hurtes & damages, not able 
for wa~t of reaso~ to rule the~ selues, 
& therby enclined to al vices aud diseases: 
for thauoiding of these same, increase 
of vertue, witte and health, sauing 
victualles, making plenty, auoyding 
lothesomenesse or wearinesse, by 
chaunge, in taking sometime of that in 
the sea, and not alwaies destroieng y=t= of 
the lande, an ordre (without the whiche 
nothing can stand) and comon wealth, 
dayes of abstinence, and fasting were 
firste made, and not for religion onely. 
 
Auoidance, because it ca~not be safely 
done withoute the healpe of a good 
Phisicien, I let passe here, expressing 
howe it shoulde bee done duelye accordinge 
to the nature of the disease 
and the estate of the personne, in an 
[^f.27r^] 
other booke made by me in Latine, 
vppon this same matter and disease. 
Who therfore lusteth to see more, 
let him loke vpon that boke. Yet here 
thus much wil I say, that if after euacuation 
or auoiding of humors, the pores 
of the skinne remaine close, and y=e= 
sweating excrement in the fleshe continueth 
grosse (whiche thinge howe to 
know, hereafter I will declare) then 
rubbe you the person meanly at home, 
& bathe him in faire water sodden with 
Fenel, Chamemil, Rosemarye, Mallowes, 
& Lauendre, & last of al, powre 
water half colde ouer al his body, and 
so dry him, & clothe him. Al these be to 
be don a litle before y=e= end of y=e= spring, 
that the humours may be seatled, and 
at rest, before the time of the sweting, 
whiche cometh comonly in somer; if it 
cometh at al. For the tormoiling of the 
body in that time when it ought to be 
most quiete, at rest, and armed against 
his enemy, liketh me not beste here, no 
more then in the pestilence. Yet for the 
presente nede, if it be so thoughte good 
[^f.27v^] 
to a learned and discrete Phisicien, I 
condescend the rather. For as in thys, 
so in alle others before rehearsed, 
I remytte you to the discretion of 
a learned manne in phisike, who maye 
iudge what is to be done, and how, according 
to the present estate of youre 
bodies, nature, custome, and proprety, 
age, strength, delyghte and qualitie, 
tyme of the yeare, with other circumstaunces, 
and thereafter to geue the 
quantitie, and make diuersitie of hys 
medicine. Other wise loke not to receiue 
by this boke that good which I entend, 
but that euel which by your owne 
foly you vndiscretelye bring. For 
good counseil may be abused. And for 
me to write of euery particular estate 
and case, whiche be so manye as there 
be menne, were so great almost a busines, 
as to numbre the sandes in the sea. 
Therfore seke you out a good Phisicien, 
and knowen to haue skille, and at 
the leaste be so good to your bodies, as 
you are to your hosen or shoes, for the 
wel making or mending wherof, I doubt 
[^f.28r^] 
not but you wil diligently searche 
out who is knowe~ to be the best hosier 
or shoemaker in the place where you 
dwelle: and flie the vnlearned as a pestilence 
in a comune wealth. As simple 
women, carpenters, pewterers, brasiers, 
sopeballesellers, pulters, hostellers, 
painters, apotecaries (otherwise 
then for their drogges,) auaunters the~ 
selues to come from Pole, Constantinople, 
Italie, Almaine, Spaine, Fraunce, 
Grece and Turkie, Inde, Egipt 
or Iury: from y=e= seruice of Emperoures, 
kinges & quienes, promising helpe 
of al diseases, yea vncurable, with one 
or twoo drinckes, by waters sixe monethes 
in continualle distillinge, by 
Aurum potabile, or quintessence, 
by drynckes of great and hygh prices, 
as though thei were made of the su~ne, 
moone, or sterres, by blessynges and 
Blowinges, Hipocriticalle prayenges, 
and foolysh smokynges of shirtes 
Smockes and kerchieffes, wyth suche 
others theire phantasies, and mockeryes, 
meaninge nothinge els but to 
[^p.28v^] 
abuse your light belieue, and scorne 
you behind your backes with their medicines 
(so filthie, that I am ashamed 
to name theim) for your single wit and 
simple belief, in trusting the~ most, whiche 
you know not at al and vndersta~d 
least: like to them whiche thinke, farre 
foules haue faire fethers, althoughe 
thei be neuer so euel fauoured & foule: 
as thoughe there coulde not be so 
conning an Englishman, as a foolish running 
stranger, (of others I speake not) 
or so perfect helth by honest learning, 
as by deceiptfull ignorance. For in the 
erroure of these vnlerned, reasteth the 
losse of your honest estimation, diere 
bloudde, precious spirites, and swiete 
lyfe, the thyng of most estimation and 
price in this worlde, next vnto the immortal 
soule. 
 
For consuming of euel matter within, 
and for making our bodies lustye, 
galiard, & helthful, I do not a litle co~mende 
exercise, whiche in vs Englishe 
men I allowe quick, and liuishe: as to 
runne after houndes and haukes, to 
[^f. 29r^] 
shote, wrastle, play at Te~nes and weapons, 
tosse the winde balle, skirmishe 
at base (an exercise for a gentlemanne, 
muche vsed among the Italianes) and 
vaughting vpon an horse. Bowling, a 
good excercise for women: castinge of 
the barre and camping, I accompt rather 
a laming of legges, then an exercise. 
Yet I vtterly reproue theim not, 
if the hurt may be auoyded. For these 
a conueniente tyme is, before meate: 
due measure, reasonable sweatinge, in 
al times of the yeare, sauing in the sweatinge 
tyme. In the whiche I allow 
rather quietnesse then exercise, for 
opening the body, in suche persons specially 
as be liberally & freely brought 
vp. Others, except sitting artificers, 
haue theire exercises by daily labours 
in their occupatio~s, to whom nothing 
niedeth but solace onely, a thing conuenient 
for euery bodye that lusteth to 
liue in helth. For els as no~ other thing, 
so not healthe canne be longe durable. 
Thus I speake of solace, that I meane 
not Idlenesse, wisshing alwayes no 
[^f.29v^] 
man to be idle, but to be occupied 
in some honest kinde of thing necessary in 
a co~mon welth. For I accompt the~ not 
worthi meate & drink in a co~mo~ welth, 
y=t= be not good for some purpose or seruice 
therin, but take the~ rather as burdennes 
vnprofitable and heauye to the 
yearth, men borne to fille a numbre only, 
and wast the frutes whiche therthe 
doeth geue, willing soner to fiede the 
Lacedemonians old & croked asse,whiche 
labored for the liuing so long as it 
coulde for age, then suche an idle Englisshe 
manne. If the honestye and 
profite of honeste labour and exercise, 
conseruation of healthe, preseruation 
from sickenesse, maintenaunce of lyfe, 
aduauncement, safety from shamefull 
deathes, defence from beggerye, dyspleasures 
by idlenesse, shamefulle diseases 
by the same, hatefulle vices, 
and punishemente of the immortalle 
soule, canne not moue vs to reasonable 
laboure and excercise, and to be 
profitable membres of the commune 
welthe, let at the least shame moue vs, 
[^f.30r^] 
seyng that other country menne, of nought, 
by their owne witte, diligence, 
labour and actiuitie, can picke oute of 
a cast bone, a wrethen strawe, a lyghte 
fether, or an hard stone, an honeste lyuinge: 
Nor ye shal euer heare theym 
say, alas master, I haue no~ occupacio~, 
I must either begge or steale. For they 
can finde other meanes betwene these 
two. And forsomuche as in the case 
that nowe is, miserable persons are to 
be relieued in a co~mon welth, I would 
wisshe for not fauouring the idle, the 
discretion of .Marc. Cicero the romaine 
were vsed in healping them: Who 
wolde compassion should be shewed vpon 
them, whome necessitie compelled 
to do or make a faute: & no co~passion vpon 
them, in whome a faulte made necessitie. 
A faulte maketh necessitie, in 
this case of begging, in them, whyche 
might laboure and serue, & wil not for 
idlenes: and therfore not to be pitied, 
but rather to be punished. Necessitie 
maketh a fault in the~, whiche wold labor 
& serue, but ca~not for age, i~pote~cy, 
[^f.30v^] 
or sickenes, and therfore to be pitied, & 
relieued. But to auoyde punishmente 
& to shew the waye to amendmente, I 
would again wishe, y=t= forsomuch as we 
be so euel disposed of our selfes to our 
own profites and comodities with out 
help, this old law were renued, which 
forbiddeth the nedy & impotent parentes, 
to be releued of those their welthi 
chyldren, that by theym or theire meanes 
were not broughte vppe, eyther in 
good learning and Science, or honeste 
occupation. For so is a man withoute 
science, as a realme withoute a kyng. 
Thus muche of exercise, and for exercise. 
To the which I wolde now ioyne 
honeste companye betwene man and 
woman, as a parte of natural exercise, 
and healpe to y=e= emptieng & lightning 
the bodye in other tymes allowed, in 
this sweating tyme for helthes sake, & 
for feare of opening the bodye, and resoluing 
the spirites, not approued, but 
for dout, that w=t= lengthing the boke, I 
shold wery y=e= reader. Therfore I let y=t= 
passe & come to sleping & waking, whiche 
[^f.31r^] 
without good ordre, be gretly hurtful 
to the bodie. For auoiding the whiche, 
I take the meane to be best, and against 
this sweat moste commendable. 
But if by excesse a man must in eyther 
part offend, I permit rather to watch 
to muche, then to lie in bedde to longe: 
so that in watchinge, there be no way 
to surfetting. Al these thinges duely 
obserued, and well executed, whiche 
before I haue for preseruation 
mencioned, if more ouer we can sette a 
parte al affections, as fretting cares & 
thoughtes, dolefull or sorowfull imaginations, 
vaine feares, folysh loues, 
gnawing hates, and geue oure selues 
to lyue quietly, frendlie, & merily one 
with an outher, as men were wont to 
do in the old world, whe~ this countrie 
was called merye Englande, and euery 
man to medle in his own matters, 
thinking theim sufficient, as thei do in 
Italye, and auoyde malyce and dissencion, 
the destruction of commune wealthes, 
and priuate houses: I doubte 
not but we shall preserue oure selues, 
[^f.31v^] 
bothe from this sweatinge syckenesse, 
and other diseases also not here purposed 
to be spoken of. 
 
[/4./] 
But if in leauinge a parte these or 
some of them, or negligently executing 
them, it chaunceth the disease of sweating 
to trouble our bodies, then passinge 
the bondes and compasse of preseruation, 
we must come to curation, the 
way to remedie the disease, & the third 
and last parte (as I first sayed) to be entreated 
in this boke. The principalle 
entente herof, is to let out the venime 
by sweate accordinge to the course of 
nature. This is brought to passe safely 
two waies, by suffring and seruing 
handsomly nature, if it thruste it oute 
readily and kindely: and helping nature, 
if it be letted, or be weake in expellinge. 
Serue nature we shall, if in 
what time so euer it taketh vs, or 
what so euer estate, we streyghte lay 
vs downe vppon oure bedde, yf we be 
vp and in oure clothes, not takyinge 
them of: or lie stille, if we be in bed out 
of our clothes, laiyng on clothes both 
[^f.32r^] 
wayes, if we wante, reasonably, and 
not loadinge vs therewith vnmeasurably. 
Thus layed and couered, we 
must endeuoure our selues so to continue 
wyth al quietnes, & for so much 
as may be without feare, distruste, or 
faintehartednesse, an euel thinge in al 
diseases. For suche surrendre and geue 
ouer to the disease without resistence. 
By whiche occasion manye more died 
in the fyrste pestilence at Athenes, 
that I spake of in the beginnynge of 
thys boke, then other wyse should. 
Oure kepers, friendes and louers, 
muste also endeuoure theym selues to 
be handesome and dilygente aboute 
vs, to serue vs redilye at al turnes, 
and neuer to leaue vs duringe foure 
and twentie houres, but to loke welle 
vnto vs, that neyther we caste of oure 
clothes, nor thruste out hande or foote, 
duryng the space of the saide foure and 
twenty houres. For albeit the greate 
daungere be paste after twelue houres, 
or fourtene, the laste of trial, yet 
many die aftre by to muche boldenes, 
[^f.32v^] 
when thei thinke theim selues most in 
suretye, or negligence in attendaunce, 
when they thinke no necessitie. Wherby 
it is proued that without dout, the 
handsome diligence, or carelesse negligence, 
is the sauing, or casting awaye 
of many. If .ij. be taken in one bed, let 
theym so continue, althoughe it be to 
their vnquietnesse. For feare wherof, 
& for the more quietnesse & safetye, very 
good it is duryng all the sweating 
time, that two persones lye not in one 
bed. If with this quietnes, dilige~ce, 
and ordre, the sicke do kindelye sweate, 
suffre them so to continue, without 
meate all the .xxiiij. houres: withoute 
drincke, vntil the fifth houre, if it maie 
be. Alwayes taking hede to theim in 
the fourth, seuenth, nineth, & eleuenth 
houres speciallye, and fourteenth also, 
as the laste of triall and daungier,but 
of lesse in bothe. For these be most perilous, 
as I haue obserued this yere in 
this disease, hauing y=e= houres iudicial, 
as others haue theire dayes, and therfore 
worse to geue anye thinge in, for 
[^f.33r^] 
troublyng nature standyng in trialle. 
Yet wher more daunger is in forbearyng 
then in takyng, I counseill not to 
spare in these howres to do as the case 
requireth with wisdome & discretion, 
but lesse then in other howres. In 
the fifthe howre geue theim to drinke 
clarified ale made only doulcet with a 
litle suger, out of a cruet, or glasse 
made in cruet facion, with a nebbe, for 
feare of raisynge theim selues to receiue 
the drinke offered, & so to let the 
sweat, by the ayer strikyng in. But 
if the sicke on this wise beforesaid ca~not 
sweate kyndly, then nature must 
be holpen, as I sayd before. And for so 
moch as sweat is letted in this disease 
fower waies, by disorder, wekenes 
of nature, closenes of the pores in the 
skinne, & grosnes of the humoures: my 
counseil is to auoide disorder by suche 
meanes as hetherto I haue taught, 
and next to open the pores if they be 
close, and make thinne the matter, if it 
be grosse, and prouoke sweat, if nature 
be weke. Those you shal doe by gentle 
[^f.33v^] 
rubbynges, this by warme drinckes as 
hereafter streight I will declare. And 
for that euery man hath not the knowlege 
to discerne which of these is the 
cause of let in sweatyng, I wil shewe 
you plainly howe to do with moste 
suretie and leste offense. I wyll beginne 
with wekenes of nature. Therefore 
remember well that in treatynge 
the causes of this disease, I sayed 
that this sweate chauncethe co~monly 
in theim of the mydde age and beste 
luste, the infection hauyng a certein 
concordance, or conuenience with the 
corrupte spirites of theim more then 
others. Knowe agayne that nature is 
weke, ij. waies, either in the selfe, or 
by the annoiance of an other. In the 
selfe, by wante of strength consumed 
by sicknes or other wise. By annoiaunce 
of an other, when nature is so ouerlaid 
with the quantitie of euill humours 
that it can not stirre. Betwene 
thes two set youre witte, and se whether 
the perso~ be lustye or sickly. If he 
be lustye, vnderstande that the sweat 
[^f.34r^] 
doth not stoppe for wekenes of nature 
in it selfe. Then of necessitie it must be 
for some of thother causes.
