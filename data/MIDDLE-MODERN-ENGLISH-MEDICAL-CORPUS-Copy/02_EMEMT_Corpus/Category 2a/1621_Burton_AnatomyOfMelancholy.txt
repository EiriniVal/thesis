[}Mans Excellency, Fall, Miseries, Infirmities, 
The causes of them.}] 
 
[/1./] 
MAN, the most excellent, and most 
noble creature of the World, the 
principall and mightie worke of God, 
and wonder of nature, as Zoroastes 
calls him, the [/2./] marvaill of marvaills, 
as Plato, the [/3./] Abridgment and Epitome 
of the World, as Pliny tearmes 
him, Microcosmus, a little World, a 
model of the World, [/4./], Soueraigne 
Lord of the Earth, and sole Commander and Governour of 
all the Creatures in it: to whose Empyre they are all subiect 
in particular, and yeeld obedience, farre surpassing all the rest, 
not in body only, but in soule, [/5./] Imaginis Imago, [/6./], created to 
Gods owne, [/7./] Image, to that immortall and incorporeall substance, 
with all the faculties and powers belonging vnto it, 
was at first pure, divine, perfect, happy, [/8./] Created after God 
in true holinesse and righteousnesse: Deo congruens, free from all 
manner of infirmities, and put in Paradise, to knowe God, to 
praise and glorify him, to doe his will. 
 
Ut dijs consimiles parturiat Deos; 
as an old Poet saith, to propagate the Church. But this most 
[^p.2^] 
noble creature, Heu tristis & lachrimosa commutatio ([/9./] one 
exclaimes) O pittifull change; is salue from that he was, and 
forfeited his estate, become miserabilis homuncio, a castaway, 
a caitiffe, one of the most miserable creatures of the World, if 
he be considered in his owne nature, an vnregenerate man, & 
so much obscured by his fall (that some few reliques excepted) 
he is inferiour to a beast. [/10./] Man in honour that vnderstandeth 
not is like vnto beasts that perish, so Dauid esteemes 
him: a monster by a stupend Metamorphosis, [/11./] a Beast, a 
Dogge, a Hogge, what not? Quantum mutatus ab illo? How 
much altered from that hee was, before blessed and happy, 
now miserable accursed; [/12./] He must eat his meat in sorrow, subiect 
to death and all manner of infirmities, all kinde of calamities. 
[/13./] Great trauell is created for all men, and an heauy Yoke 
on the sonnes of Adam, from the day that they goe out of their 
mother's wombe vnto that day they returne to the mother of all 
things. Namely their thoughts, & feare of their hearts, & their 
imagination of things they wait for, and the day of death. To him 
that sitteth in the glorious throne, to him that sitteth beneath in 
earth and ashes, from him that is cloathed in blew silke, and weareth 
a crowne, to him that is cloathed in simple linnen. Wrath, 
[/14./] 
enuy, trouble, and vnquietnesse, and feare of death, and rigor, and 
strife, and such things come to both Man and Beast, but seauenfold 
to the vngodly. All this befalls him in this life, and peradventure 
eternall misery in the life to come. 
 
The impulsiue cause of all these miseries in man, this privation 
or destruction of Gods Image, the cause of death and 
[/15./] 
diseases, of all temporall and eternall punishments, was the 
sinne of our first parent Adam, [/16./] in eating of the forbidden 
fruit, by the Divells instigation and allurement. His disobedience, 
pride, ambition, intemperance, incredulity, curiosity, 
from whence proceeded originall sinne, & that generall corruption 
of mankinde, as from a fountaine flowed all bad inclinations, 
and actuall transgressions, which cause our several 
calamities, inflicted vpon vs for our sinnes. And this belike 
is that which our fabulous Poets haue shadowed vnto vs in 
[^p.3^] 
the tale of [/17./] Pandoras box, which being opened through her 
curiosity, filled the world full of all manner of Diseases. It is 
not curiosity alone, but all other crying sinnes of ours which 
pull these severall plagues and miseries vpon our heads. For 
Vbipeccatum ibi procella, as [/18./] Chrysostome well obserues. 
[/19./] Fooles by reason of their transgressions, and because of their iniquities 
are afflicted. [/20./] Feare commeth like sudden desolation, & 
destruction like a whirlewind, affliction & anguish because they 
did not feare God. [/21./] Are you shaken with warres, as Cyprian 
well vrgeth to Demetrius, are you molested with dearth and 
famine, is your health crushed with raging diseases? is mankind 
generally tormented with Epidemicall maladies, t'is all for your 
sinnes. Haggei the 1. 9. 10. Amos the 1. Ier. 7. God is angry, 
punisheth and threatneth, because of their obstinacy & stubburnesse, 
they will not turne vnto him, [/22./] If the earth be barren 
then for want of raine, if dry and squalid, it yeeld no fruit, if your 
fountaines be dryed vp, your wine, corne, and oyle blasted, if the 
ayre be corrupted, and men troubled with diseases, tis by reason of 
your sinnes. Which like the bloud of Abel cry lowd to Heaven 
for vengeance, Lament. Ier. cap. 5. 15. that wee haue sinned, 
therefore our hearts is heauy, Isay .59. 11. 12. VVee roare like 
Beares, and mourne like Doues, and want health, &c. for our 
sinnes and trespasses. But this we cannot endure to heare, or to 
take notice of it. Ier. 2. 30. We are smitten in vaine, and receaue 
no correction. & cap. 5. 3. Thou hast striken them, but they haue 
not sorrowed, they haue refused to receaue correction, they 
haue not returned. [/23./] Herod could not abide Iohn Baptist, and 
[/24./] Domitian could not endure Apollonius tell the causes of the 
plague at Ephesus, his iniustice, his incest, adultery, and the 
like. 
 
To punish therefore this blindnesse, and obstinacy of ours 
as a concomitant cause and principall agent, is Gods iust 
iudgement in bringing these calamities vpon vs, to chastise 
vs, I say for our sinnes, and to satisfie Gods wrath. For the 
law requires obedience or punishment, as you may read at 
[^p.4^] 
large, Deut. 28. 15. If they will not obey the Lord, and keepe his 
Commandements and Ordinances, then all these curses shall 
come vpon them. [/25./] Cursed in the towne and in the field &c. [/26./] Cursed 
in the fruit of the body &c. [/27./] The Lord shall send thee trouble 
and shame, because of thy wickednesse. And a little after, [/28./] The 
Lord shall smite thee with the botch of Ægypt, and with Emrods, 
and with Scap and Itch, and thou canst not be healed. [/29./] And 
with madnesse, blindnesse, and astonishing of heart. This Paul seconds. 
Rom. 2. 9. Tribulation and anguish on the soule of euery 
man that doth euill. Or else these chastisements are inflicted 
vpon vs for our humiliation, to exercise and trie our patience 
here in this life, to bring vs home, to make vs knowe God & 
our selues, to informe vs, and teach vs wisdome. [/30./] Therefore 
is my people gone into captiuity, because they had no knowledge, 
therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against this people, & 
he hath stretched out his hand vpon them. He is desirous of our 
salvation, [/31./] Nostræ salutis auidus, saith Lemnius, and for that 
cause pulls vs by the eare many times, to put vs in minde of 
[/32./] 
our duties. That they that erred might haue vnderstanding (as 
Isay speakes 29. 21. and so bee reformed. I am afflicted and at 
the point of death, as Dauid confesseth of himselfe, Psal. 88. 15. 
& ver. 9. mine eyes are sorrowfull through mine affliction. And 
that made him turne vnto God. Great Alexander in the 
midst of all his prosperity, and by a company of Parasites deified, 
and now made a God, when he saw one of his wounds 
bleed, remembred that he was but a man, and remitted of his 
pride, In morbo recolligit se animus, as [/33./] Pliny well perceaued, 
In sicknesse the minde reflects vpon it selfe, and with iudgement 
surnayes it selfe, and abhorres his former courses, insomuch that 
he concludes to his frend Marius, [/34./] that it were the period of al 
Philosophy, if we could so continue being sound, or performe but 
a part of that which we promised to doe being sicke. Who so is 
wise then will consider these things, as Dauid did, Ps. 1 44. vers. 
last. And whatsoever fortune befall him, make vse of it. If he 
be in sorrow, need, sicknesse, or any other adversity, seriously 
to consider with himselfe, why this or that malady, misery 
[^p.5^] 
this or that incurable disease is inflicted vpon him; it may be 
for his good, [/35./] sic expedit, as Peter said of his daughters ague. 
Bodily sicknesse is for his soules health, perijsset nisi perijsset, 
had he not beene visited, he had vtterly perished [/36./] for the Lord 
correcteth him whom he loueth, euen as a father doth his child in 
whome he delighteth. If he be safe and sound on the other side, 
and free from all manner of infirmity, [/37./] & cui 
 
Gratia, forma, valetudo contingat abunde, 
Et mundus victus non deficiente crumena, 
And that he haue grace, beauty, favour, health, 
The World at his command, abound in wealth. 
 
Yet in the middest of all his prosperity, let him remember 
that Caveat of Moyses, [/38./] beware that he doe not forget the Lord 
his God, that he be not puffed vp, but acknowledge them to 
be his good gifts and benefits, and vse them aright. 
 
Now the instrumentall causes of these our infirmities, are 
[/39./] 
as diverse, as the infirmities themselues, starres, heauens, elements, 
&c. and all those creatures which God hath made, are 
armed against sinners. They were indeed once good in themselues, 
and that they are now many of them pernicious vnto 
vs, is not in their nature, but our corruption, which hath caused 
it. For from the fall of our first parent Adam, they haue 
beene changed, the earth accursed, the influence of starres altered, 
the foure elements, Beasts, Birds, Plants, are now ready 
to offend vs. The principall things for the vse of man is Water, 
Fire, Iron, Salt, Meale, Wheate, Hony, Milke, Oyle, Wine, 
Cloathing, good to the Godly, to the Sinners turned to euill. 
Ecclus 39. 26. Fire, and Haile, and Famine, and Death, all these 
are created for vengeance, Ecclus 39. 29. The Heauens threaten 
vs with their Comets, Starres, Planets, with their great 
coniunctions, Ecclipses, oppositions, quartiles, and such vnfriendly 
aspects. The aire with his Meteors, Thunder and 
Lightning, intemperate heat and cold, mighty windes, tempests, 
vnseasonable weather; from which proceeds, dearth, 
famine, plague, and all manner of Epidemicall diseases; consuming 
infinite myrriads of men. As at Cairo in Egypt every 
[^p.6^] 
third yeare, it is related by [/40./] Boterus and others, 300000. of 
the plague, and 200000. in Constantinople, every fift or seaventh 
at the vtmost. How doth the earth terrifie & oppresse 
vs with those terrible Earthquaks, which are most frequent 
in [/41./] China, Iapan, and hose Easterne Climes, swallowing vp 
sometimes, 6. Citties at once. How doth the water rage with 
his inundations, irruptions, flinging downe Townes, Citties, 
Villages, Bridges, &c. beside shipwracks, whole Ilands are 
sometimes suddenly overwhelmed with al their inhabitants, 
as in [/42./] Zeland, Holland, & many parts of the continent drowned, 
as the [/43./] lake Erno in Ireland. [/44./] Nihilq~, præter arcium cadauera 
patenti cernimus steto. How doth the fire rage that 
mercilesse element? Consuming in an instant whole Citties. 
What towne of any antiquity or note, hath not beene once, 
againe and againe, by the fury of this mercilesse element defaced, 
vtterly ruinated, and left desolate. To descend to more 
particulars, how many creatures are at deadly fuid with me? 
Lions, Wolues, Beares, &c. Some with Hoofes, Hornes, 
Tusks, Teeth, Tailes: How many noxious Serpents and venomous 
creatures, ready to offend vs with stings, breath, 
sight, or quite kill vs? How many pernitious fishes, plants, 
gammes, fruis, seeds, flowers, &c. could I reckon vp on a 
suddaine, which by their very smell many of them, touch, 
tast, cause some grevous malady, if not death it selfe. Some 
make mention of a thousand severall poysons: but these are 
but trifles in respect. The greatest enemy to man, in man himselfe, 
[/45./] 
who by the Divells instigation, is still ready to doe 
mischiefe to himselfe and others, his owne executioner, a 
Wolfe, a Divell to himselfe, and others. Sometimes by the 
Divells helpe, as Magitians, [/46./] Witches: sometimes by impostures, 
mixtures, poysons, stratagemmes, single cumbats, 
warres. We hacke and hew one another, as if we were ad interuccionem 
nati, like Cadmus souldiers borne to consume one 
another. T'is an ordinary thing to read of an 100000, and 
two hundred thousand men slaine in a battaile. Besides all 
maner of tortures, brasen bulls, racks, wheeles, strappadoes, 
[^p.7^] 
gunnes, enginnes, &c. [/47./] Ad vnum corpus humanum supplicia 
plura, quam membra. Wee haue invented more torturing instruments, 
then there be severall members in a mans body, 
as Cyprian well obserues. To come neerer yet, our own parents 
by their offences, indiscretion, and intemperance are 
our mortall enemies. [/48./] The fathers haue eaten sower grapes, & 
the childrens teeth are set on edge. They cause our griefe many 
times, and put vpon vs hereditary diseases, ineuitable infirmities: 
They torment vs, and wee are as ready to iniure our 
posteritie. ---- [/49./] mox daturi progeniem viciosiorem, & the latter 
ende of the world, as [/50./] Paule foretold, is still like to bee 
worst. We are thus bad by nature, bad by kinde, but farr 
worse by art, every man the greatest enemy vnto himselfe. 
We study many times to vndoe our selues, abusing those 
good gifts which God hath bestowed vpon vs, Health, 
Wealth, Strength, Wit, Learning, Art, Memory, to our owne 
destruction, [/51./] Perditio tua ex te. As [/52./] Iudas Machabeus killed 
Apollonius friends with his owne weapons, we arme our 
selues to our owne ouerthrowes, as vse Reason, Art, Iudgment, 
all that should helpe vs, as so many instruments to vndoe 
vs. As S. Austin confesseth of himselfe in his humble 
Confessions, promptnesse of Wit, Memory, Eloquence, they were 
Gods good gifts, but he did not vse them to his glory. If you will 
particularly know how, and by what meanes, consult Physitians, 
and they will tell you, that it is in offending in some of 
those six non-naturall things, of which I shall after [/53./] dilate 
more large; they are the causes of our infirmities, our surfeting 
& drunkennes, our immoderate infatiable lust, & prodigious 
riot. Plures crapula, quam gladius, it is a true saying, 
the borde consumes more then the sword. Our intemperance 
it is, that pulls so many severall incurable diseases vpon our 
heads, that hastens [/54./] olde age, perverts our temperature, and 
brings vpon vs sudden death. And last of all, that wuich crucifies 
vs most, is our owne folly, want of governement, our 
facilitie and pronenesse in yeelding to our several lust, and giving 
way to euery passion and perturbation of the minde, by 
[^p.8^] 
which meanes we metamorphize our selues, and degenerate 
into beasts. As that [/55./] Poet obserued of Agamemnon, that 
when he was well-pleased, and could moderate his passion, 
he was --- os oculosq~ Iovi par: like Iupiter in feature, Mars in 
valour, Pallas in wisdome. another god; but when he was angry, 
he was a Lion, a Tiger, a dogge, &c. there was no signe 
or likenesse of Iupiter in him; so wee, as long as wee are ruled 
by reason, as long as we correct our inordinate appetite, and 
conforme our selues to Gods word, are as so many liuing 
Saints, but if we giue reines to Lust, Anger, Ambition, Pride, 
and follow our owne wayes, wee degenerate into beasts, 
transforme our selues, ouerthrow our constitutions, [/56./] provoke 
God to anger, and heape vpon vs this of Melancholy, 
and all manner of incurable diseases, as a just and deserued 
punishment of our sinnes.

[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
Definition of Diseases. 
Number [^of Diseases.^] 
Division [^of Diseases.^] 
[^End of a list figure.^]}] 
 
WHat a Disease is, almost every Physitian defines. 
[/57./] Fernelius calleth in an Affection of the Body, contrary 
to Nature. [/58./] Fuchsius and Crato, an hinderance, hurt, or 
alteration of any action of the Body, or any part of it. [/59./] Tholosanus, 
a dissolution of that league which is betweene Body and 
Soule, and a perturbation of it: as health is the perfection, and 
makes to the preseruation of it. [/60./] Labeo in Agellius, an ill habite 
of the Body, opposite to nature, hindering the vse of it. Others 
otherwise, all to this effect. 
 
How many Diseases there are, is a question not yet determined. 
[/61./] Pliny reckons vp 300. from the Crowne of the 
Head, to the sole of the Foote: elswhere he saith, morborum 
infinita a multitudo, their number is infinite. Howsoeuer it was 
[^p.9^] 
in those olde times, it bootes not; in our dayes I am sure the 
number is much augmented: for besides many Epidemicall 
diseases vnheard of, and altogether vnknowne to Galen and 
Hippocrates, as Scorbutum, Small pox, Plica, Sweating Sicknesse, 
Morbus Gallicus &c. we haue many proper, and peculiar 
almost to euery part. No man amongst vs to sound, of so 
good a constitution, that hath not some impediment of Body 
or Minde. [/62./] quisq~, suos patimur manes, we haue all our 
infirmities, first or last, more or lesse. There may bee peradventure 
in an age, or one of a thousand, like Zenophilus 
the Musician in [/63./] Pliny, that may happily liue 105. yeeres, 
without any manner of impediment. A Pollio Romulus, that 
may preserue himselfe [/64./] with wine and oyle. A man as fortunate 
as Q. Metellus, of whom Valerius so much bragges. A 
man as healthfull as Otto Herwardus, a Senator of Ausburrow 
in Germanie, whom [/65./] Leouitius the Astrologer brings in 
for an example, and instance of certaintie in his Arte, who 
because he had the significators in his geniture fortunate, and 
free from the hostile aspects of Saturne and Mars, being a 
very olde man, [/66./] could not remember that euer he was sicke. 
[/67./] Paracelsus may bragge, that he could make a man liue 400 
yeares or more, if he might bring him vp from his Infancie, 
and diet him as he lift; and some Physitians hold, that there 
is no certaine period of mans life; but it may still by temperance, 
and Physicke, be prolonged. We finde in the meane 
time, by common experience, that no man can escape, but 
that of [/68./] Hesiod it true: 
 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] 
The Earth is full of maladies, and full the Sea, 
Which set vpon vs both by night and day. 
 
[/69./] 
If you require a more exact division of these ordinarie 
Diseases, which are incident to men, I referre you to [/70./] Physitians; 
they will tell you of Acute and Chronicke, First and 
Secundary, Lethales Salutares, Errant Fixed, Simple Compound, 
[^p.10^] 
Connexed, or Consequent, belonging to parts, or the whole, in 
Habit, or in Disposition, &c. My division at this time (as most 
befitting my purpose) shall be into those of the Body and of 
the Minde. For those of the Body, a briefe Catalogue of 
which Fuschius hath made, Institut. lib. 3. sec. 1. cap 11. I refer 
you to those volumous Tomes of Galen, Arcteus, Rhasis, 
Avicenna, Alexander, Paulus, Ætius, Gordonius, Guianerius: 
And those exact Neotericks, Savanarola, Capiuaccius, Donatus 
Altomarus, Hercules de Saxonia, Mercurialis, Victorius 
Faventinus, Wecker, Piso, &c. that haue methodically, and elaborately 
written of them all. Those of the Mind and Head, 
I will briefly handle, and a-part. 
 
[}SVBSEC. 3. 
 
Division of the Diseases of the Head.}] 
 
THese Diseases of the Minde, forasmuch as they haue 
their chiefe seat, and Organs in the Head, are commonly 
repeated amongst the diseases of the Head, which are divers, 
and vary much according to their site. For in the Head, as 
there be divers parts, so there be divers grievances, which 
according to that division of [/71./] Hernius, which he takes out 
of Arculanus, are inward or outward (to omit all others 
which belong to the Eyes, and Eares, Nostrills, Gummes, 
Teeth, Mouth, Palat, Tongue, Wesell, Choppes, Face, &c.) 
belonging properly to the Braine, as baldnesse, falling of 
haire, furfair, lice &c. [/72./] Inward belonging to the skinnes 
next to the Braine, called duræ, and Pia mater, as all headaches, 
&c. or to the Ventricles, Caules, Kells, Tunicles, 
Creekes, and parts of it, and their passions, as Caro, Vertigo, 
Incubus, Apoplexie, Falling Sicknesse. The diseases of the 
Nerues; Crampes, Stupor, Convulsion, Tremor, Palsye: or belonging 
to the excrements of the Braine, as Catars, Sneezing, 
Rhumes, Distillations: or else those that pertaine to the Substance 
of the Braine it selfe, in which are conceiued, Frensye, 
[^p.11^] 
Lethargye, Melancholy, Madnesse, weake Memory. Sapor, or 
Coma, Vigilia & vigil Coma. Out of these againe I will single 
such as properly belong to the Phantasie, or Imagination, 
or Reason it selfe, which [/73./] Laurentius calles the Diseases of 
the Minde; and Hildisheim, morbos Imaginationis, aut Rationis 
læsæ, which are three or foure in number, Frensye, Madnes, 
Melancholy, Dotage, and their kindes: as Hydrophobia, Lycanthropia, 
Chorus sancti vits, morbi demoniaci: which I will 
briefely touch and point out, insisting especially in this of 
Melancholy, as more eminent then the rest, and that through 
all his kindes, causes, symptomes, prognosticks, cures. As Lonicerus 
hath done de Apoplexia, and many others, of many 
such particular diseases. Not that I finde fault with others 
which haue written of this subiect before, as Iason Pratensis, 
Laurentius, Montaltus, T: Bright, &c. they haue done well in 
their severall kindes and methods, yet that which one omits, 
another may happily see; that which one contracts, another 
may enlarge. To conclude with [/74./] Scribanius, that which they 
haue neglected, or perfunctorily handled, we may more thoroughly 
examine, that which is obscurely deliuered in them, may be 
perspicuously dilated and amplified by vs; and so may bee made 
more familiar and easie for enery mans capacity, and common 
good, which is the chiefe end of my Discourse. 
 
[}SVBSEC. 4. 
 
Dotage, Phrensie, Madnesse, Hydrophobia, Lycanthropia, 
Chorus sancti viti, Extasis.}] 
 
Dotago, Fatuity, or Folly, is a common name to all the 
[/75./] 
following Species, as some will haue it. [/76./] Laurentius 
and [/77./] Altomarum comprehend Madnesse, Melancholy, and 
the rest, vnder this name, and callat the summum genius of 
them all. If it be distinguished from them, it is naturall or ingenit, 
which comes by some defect of the Organs, and ouermoist 
Braine, as wee see in our common fooles; and is for the 
[^p.12^] 
most part intended or remitted in most men, and thereupon 
some are wiser then other: or els it is acquisite, an Appendix 
or Symptome of some other disease, which comes or goes, or 
it it continue, a signe of Melancholy it selfe. 
 
Phrenitis, which the Greeks deriue from the word [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
[/78./] 
is a Disease of the Minde, with a continuall Madnesse or Dotage, 
which hath an acute feuer annexed, or els an inflammation 
of the Braine, or the Membranes or Kells of it, with an 
acute Feuer, which causeth Madnesse, and Dotage. It differs 
from Melancholy and Madnesse, because their Dotage is 
without an ague: this continuall, with waking, or Memory 
decayed &c. Melancholy is most part silent; this clamorous, 
and many such like differences are assigned by Phisitians. 
 
[/79./] 
Madnesse, Phrensie, and Melancholy are confounded by 
many Writers, as Celsus: others leaue out Phresie, and 
make Madnesse, and Melancholy but one Disease, which 
[/80./] Iason Pratensis especially labours, and that they differ onely 
secundium maius or minus, in quantity, the one being a degree 
to the other, and both proceeding from one cause. They 
differ intenso & remisso gradu, saith [/81./] Gordonius, as the humor 
is intended or remitted. Of the same minde is [/82./] Areteus Alexander 
Trallianus, Guianerius, Savanarola, Hernius, and 
Galen himselfe writes promiscuously of them both, by reason 
of their affinity, but most of our Neotericks doe handle 
them a-part, whom I will follow in this Treatise. Madnesse 
is therefore defined to be a vehement Dotage, or rauing without 
a feuer, farre more violent then Melancholy, full of anger, 
and clamor, horrible lookes, actions, gestures; and troubles 
the Patient with farre greater vehemency both of Body and 
Minde, without all feare and sorrow, with such impentuous 
force, and boldnesse, that sometimes three or foure men cannot 
hold them. Differing onely in this from Frensie, that it is 
without a Feuer, and their Memory is most part better. It 
hath the same causes as the other, as Choler adust, and Blood 
incensed, Braines inflamed &c. [/83./] Fracastorius addes a due time 
[^p.13^] 
and full age to this definition, to distuinguish it from children, 
and will haue it to be a confirmed Impotency, to separate it from 
such as accidentally come and goe againe, as by taking Henbane, 
Nightshade, Wine, &c. Ot this Fury there be divers [/84./] kindes, 
Extasis, Enthusiasmes, Revelations, and Visions, so often mentioned 
by Gregory and Beda in their Workes; Obsession, or 
Possession of devils, Sybilline Prophets, and Poeticall Furies: 
such as come by eating noxious Herbes, Tarantulas stinging, 
&c. which some reduce to this. The most knowne are these, 
Lycanthropia, Hydrophobia, Chorus sancti viti. 
 
Lycanthropia, which Avicenna calles Cucubuth, others 
[/85./] 
Lupinam insaniam, or Woolfe madnesse, when men runne 
howling about graues and fields in the night, and will not be 
perswaded but that they are Wolues, or some such beasts. 
[/86./] Ætius and [/87./] Paulus call it a kinde of Melancholy, but I 
should rather referre it to Madnesse, as most doe. Some make 
a doubt of it, whether there be any such Disease. [/88./] Donat ab 
Altomari saith, that he saw two such in his time: and [/89./] Wierus 
tels a Story of such a one at Padua 1541, that would not 
beleeue to the contrary, but that he was a Woolfe. He hath 
another Story of a Spaniard, that thought he was a Beare. 
[/90./] Forestus confirmes as much by many examples, one amongst 
the rest, of which he was an eye-witnesse, at Alcmar in Holland, 
of a poore Husband-man, that still haunted about 
graues, and kept in Churchyards, of a pale, blacke, vgly, and 
fearefull looke. Such belike, or little better, were King Prætus 
[/91./] Daughters, that thought themselues Kine. And Nebuchadnezzar 
in Daniel, as some Interpreters hold, was only troubled 
with this kinde of Madnesse. And this Disease perhaps 
gaue occasion to that bold assertion of [/92./] Pliny, that some men 
were turned into Wolues in his time, and from Wolues to men againe. 
And to that sable of Pausanias, of a man that was ten 
yeares a Wolfe, and afterwards returned to his former shape. 
And [/93./] Ouids tale of Lycaon. He that is desirious to heare of 
this Disease, or of more examples, let him reade Austin in his 
18. Booke de Civitate Dei. cap. 5. Mizaldus cent, 5. 77. Sckenkius 
[^p.14^] 
lib. 1. Hildesheim spicel. 2. de Mania. Forestus lib. 10. de 
de m_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rbis cerebri, Olaus Magnus, &c. This Disease, saith 
Avicenna, troubleth men most in February, and is now-a-dayes 
most frequent in Bohemia and Hungary, saith [/94./] Hernius. 
They lye hid most part all day, & goe abroad in the night, 
[/95./] 
barking, howling at graues and deserts, they haue vsually hollow 
eyes, and scabbed legges and thighes, very dry and pale, saith 
[/96./] Altomarus: he giues a reason there of all the symptomes, 
and sets downe a briefe cure of them. 
 
Hydrophobia, is a kinde of Madnesse, well knowne in every 
Village, which comes by the biting of a mad dogge, or 
scratching, saith [/97./] Aurelianus, or touching, or smelling alone 
sometimes, as [/98./] Skenkius proues, and is incident to many 
other creatures aswell as men: so called, because the parties 
affected, cannot endure the sight of water, or any liquor, supposing 
still they see the picture of a dogge in it. And that 
which is more wonderfull, though they be very dry, (as in 
this malady they are) they will rather dye, then drinke, [/99./] Cælius 
Aurelianus, an ancient Writer, makes a doubt whether 
this Hydrophobia, be a passion of the Body, or the Minde. The 
part affected is the Braine, the cause, poyson that comes from 
the mad dogge, which is so hote and dry, that it consumes all 
the moisture in the body. [/100./] Hildesheim relates of some that 
died so mad, and being cut vp, had no water, scarce blood, or 
any moisture left in them. To such as are affected, the feare of 
water beginnes at 14. dayes after they are bitten, to some againe, 
not till 40. or 60. dayes after: commonly saith Hernius 
they beginne to raue, flye water, and glasses, to looke red & 
swell in the face, some 20. dayes after (if some remedy bee 
not taken in the meane time) to lye awake, to be pensiue sad, 
to see strange Visions, to barke & howle, to fall into a sown, 
and sometimes fittes of the Falling sicknesse. [/101./] Some say, 
little things like whelpes will be seene in their vrines. If any 
of these signes appeare, they are past recouery. Many times 
these symptomes will not appeare, till six or seuen moneths 
after, saith [/102./] Codrochus, and sometimes not till seuen yeare, 
[^p.15^] 
and 18. yeares, Guianerius, 12: Albertus: six or eight moneths 
after, Galen. Baldus the great Lawyer died of it, an 
Austin Fryar, and a woman in Delphe, that were [/103./] Forrestus 
Patients, were miserably consumed with it. The common 
cure in the Countrey (for such at least as dwell neere the Sea 
side) is to ducke them ouer head and eares in Sea water; some 
vse charmes, euery goodwife can prescribe Medicines. But 
the best cure to bee had in such cases, is from the most approved 
Physitians: they that will reade of them, may consult 
with Diascorides lib. 6. cap. 37. Hernius, Hildisheim, Capinaccius, 
Forrestus, Sckenkius, and before all others Codronchus 
an Italian, who hath lately written two Bookes of this Subiect. 
 
Chorus sancti Viti, or Saint Vitus dance, the lascivious 
[/104./] 
dance. [/105./] Paracelsus cals it, because they that are taken with 
it, can doe nothing but dance till they be dead. It is so called, 
for that the parties so troubled, were wont to goe to Saint 
Vitus for helpe, and after they had danced there a while, they 
were [/106./] certainly freed. T'is strange to heare how long they 
will dance, and in what manner, ouer stooles, formes, tables, 
euen great bellyed women sometimes (and yet neuer hurt 
their childe) will dance so long, that they can stirre neither 
hand nor foot, but seeme to be quite dead. One in red clothes 
they cannot abide. Musick aboue all things they loue, and 
therefore the Magistrates in Germany will hire Musitians 
to play to them, and some lusty sturdy companions to 
dance with them. This Disease hath beene very common in 
Germany, as appeares by those relations of [/107./] Sckenkius, and 
Paracelsus in his booke of Madnesse, who bragges how many 
seuerall persons he hath cured of it. Fælix Platter, de mentis 
alienat. cap. 3. reports of a woman in Basil whom he saw, 
that danced a whole moneth together. The Arabians call it 
a kinde of Palsye, Bodine in his 5. Booke de Repub. cap. 1. speaks 
of this infirmity, and Monauius in his last Epistle to Scoltzius, 
and in another to Dudithus, where you may reade more 
of it.

adde to these another Fury that proceedes from Loue, 
and another from Study, another divine or religious Fury, but 
these more properly belong to Melancholy; of all which, I 
will speake [/110./] a-part, intending to write a whole Booke of 
them. 
 
[}SVBSEC. 5. 
 
Melancholy in disposition, improperly so 
called. Æquivocations.}] 
 
MElancholy, the subiect of our present Discourse, is either 
in Disposition, or in Habite. In Disposition, is 
that transitory Melancholy, which goes and comes vpon every 
small occasion of sorrow, neede, sicknesse, trouble, feare, 
griefe, passion, or perturbation of the Minde, or any manner 
of care, discontent, or thought, which causeth anguish and vexation 
of the Spirits, any wayes opposite to pleasure, mirth, 
joy, delight, or causing frowardnesse in vs, or a dislike; In 
which Æquivocall and improper sence, we call any man Melancholy, 
that is dull, heavy, sad, sowre, lumpish, ill-disposed, 
solitary, or any way mooued, or displeased. And from these 
Melancholy Dispositions, [/111./] no man liuing is free, no Stoicke, 
none so wise, none so happy, so patient, so generous, so godly, 
so divine, that can vindicate himselfe, so well composed, but 
more or lesse, somtime or other, he feels the smart of it. [/112./] Man 
that is borne of a woman, is of short continuance, and full of troble. 
Zeno, Cato, Socrates himselfe, whom [/113./] Ælian so highly 
commends, for a moderate temper, that nothing could disturbe 
him, but going out, and comming in still Socrates kept the same 
countenance, what misery soeuer befell him: if wee may beleeue 
Plato his Disciple, was much tormented with it. 
Q. Metellus, in whom [/114./] Valerius giues an instance of all happinesse, 
[^p.17^] 
the most fortunate man then liuing, borne in that most 
flourishing city of Rome, of noble parentage, a proper man of 
person, well qualified, healthfull, rich, honourable, a Senatour, a 
Counsull, happy in his wife, happy in his children, &c. yet this 
man was not free from Melancholy, he had his share of sorrow. [/115./] 
Polycrates Samius, that flung his ring into the Sea, because 
he would participate of discontent with others, and 
had it miraculously restored to him againe shortly after, by a 
fish taken as he angled, was not free from Melancholy dispotions. 
No man can secure himselfe, the very gods had bitter 
pangs, and frequent passions, as their owne [/116./] Poets put vpon 
them. In generall, [/117./] as the heauen it selfe is, so is our life, sometimes 
faire, sometimes ouercast, tempestious, and serene; as in a 
rose, floures and prickells, in the yeare it selfe, a temperate Sommer 
sometimes, a hard Winter, a drought, and then againe pleasant 
showres: so is our life intermixt with ioyes, hopes, feares, 
sorrowes, calumnies; Invicem cedunt dolor & voluptas, there 
is a succession of pleasure and paine. 
 
[/118./] --- medio de fonte leporum, 
Surgit amari aliquid quod in ipsis floribus angat. 
 
Euen in the middest of laughing, there is sorrow, as [/119./] Solomon 
holdes: euen in the middest of all our Feasting and Iollity, as 
[/120./] Austin inferres in his Com. on the 41. Psalme, there is sorrow 
and discontent. Nothing so prosperous and pleasant, but it 
hath [/121./] some Gall in it, some complaining, some grudging, t'is 
all a [^GREEK OMITTED^], a mix't passion. We are not here as those Angels, 
and cœlestiall Powers, and Bodies, Sunne and Moone, 
to finish our course without all offence, with such constancy, 
to continue for so many ages: but subiect to infirmities, miseries, 
interrupt, tossed and tumbled vp and downe, carried about 
with euery small blast, often molested and disquieted 
[^p.18^] 
vpon every small occasion, [/122./], vncertaine, brittle, and so is all 
that wee trust vnto. [/123./] And he that knowes not this, and is not 
armed to endure it, is not fit to liue in this World, (as one condoles 
our time) he knowes not the condition of it, where with a 
reciprocall tye, pleasure and paine are still vnited, and succeede 
one another in a ring. Exie mundo, get thee gone hence if thou 
canst not brooke it, there is no way to avoide it, but to arme 
thy selfe with Patience, with Magnanimitie, to [/124./] to oppose thy 
selfe vnto it, to suffer affliction as a good Souldier of Christ; 
as [/125./] Paul adviseth, constantly to beare it. But forasmuch as 
so few can embrace this good counsell of his, & vse it aright, 
but rather as so many brute beasts, giue way to their passions, 
and voluntarily subiect and precipitate themselues into a 
Labyrinth of cares, woes, miseries; and suffer themselues to 
be ouercome by them, and cannot arme themselues with that 
patience as they ought to doe, it falleth out oftentimes that 
these Dispositions become Habits, and many Affects contemned, 
as [/126./] Seneca notes, makes a Disease. Euen as one Distillation 
not yet growne to custome, makes but a cough, but continuall and 
inveterate, causeth a consumption of the lungs: so doe these 
our Melancholy provocations, and according as the humor it 
selfe is intended, or emitted in men, or that their temperature 
of Body, or Rationall soule is better able to make resistance; 
so are they more or lesse affected. For that which is but as a 
flea-biting to one, causeth vnsufferable torment to another, 
and that which one by his singular moderation, and well-composed 
carriage can happily ouercome, a second is no whit 
able to sustaine: but vpon every small occasion of griefe, disgrace, 
losse, crosse, rumor, &c. yeeldes so farre to passion, that 
his complexion is altered, his digestion hindred, his sleepe 
gone, his spirits obscured, and his heart heauy, his Hypocondries 
missaffected, winde, crudity on a sudden overtake him, 
and he himselfe overcome with Melancholy. So that as the 
[^p.19^] 
Philosophers make [/127./] eight degrees of heate and colde. Wee 
may make 88. of Melancholy, as the parties affected are diversly 
seased with it, or haue beene plunged more or lesse into 
this Infernall gulfe, or waded deeper into it: but all these 
Melancholy fits howsoeuer, pleasing at first, or displeasing, 
violent and tyrannizing over those whom they sease on for 
the time, yet these men are but improperly so called, because 
[/128./] 
they continue not; but come and goe, as by some objects 
they are mooued. This Melancholy on which wee are to 
treate, is an Habit, morbus sonticus, or Chronichus, a Chronick 
or continuate disease, a setled humor, as [/129./] Aurelianus, and 
[/130./] others call it, not errant, but fixed, and as it was long increasing, 
so now being (pleasant, or painefull) growne to an habite, 
it will hardly be remooued. 
 
[}SEC. 1. 
MEMB. 2. 
SVBSEC. 4. 
 
Digression of Anatomy.}] 
 
BEfore I proceede to define the Disease of Melancholy, 
what it is, or to discourse farther of it, I hold it not impertinent 
to make a briefe Digression of the Anatomy of the 
Body, and Faculties of the Soule, for the better vnderstanding 
of that which is to follow; because many hard wordes 
will often occure, as Myrache, Hypocondries, Hæmrods &c. 
Imagination, Reason, Humours, Spirits, Vitall, Naturall, Animall, 
Nerues, Veines, Arteries, which of the Vulgar will not 
be so easily perceiued, what they are, how sited, and to what 
end they serue. And besides, it may peradventure giue occasion 
to some men, to examine more accurately, and seach farther 
into this most excellent Subiect, that haue time and leasure 
enough, and are sufficiently informed in all other worldly 
businesses; as to make a good bargain, buy, and sell, to 
keepe and make choyse of a good Hauke, Hound, Horse, &c. 
[^p.20^] 
but for such matters as concerne the knowledge of themselues, 
they are wholly ignorant & carelesse, they know not 
what this Body and Soule are, how combined, of what parts 
and Faculties they consist, or how a man differs from a dog. 
And what can be more ignominious and filthy (as [/131./] Melancton 
well inveighes) then for a man not to know the structure 
and composition of his owne Body, especially since the knowledge 
of it, tends so much to the preservation of his health, and information 
of his manners. To stirre them vp therefore to this 
study, to pervse those elaborate works of [/132./] Galen, Avicen, 
Bauhinus, Plater, Vesalius, Falopius, Laurentius, &c. which 
haue written copiously in Latin; or that which some of our 
industrious Countrimen haue done in our Mother Tongue, 
not long since, as that translation of [/133./] Columbus, and [/134./] Microcosmographia, 
in 13. bookes, I haue made this briefe Digression. 
Because that which [/135./] Wecker, [/136./] Melancton, [/137./] Fernelius, 
[/138./] Fuschius, and those Tracts De Anima (which haue more 
compendiously handled, and written of this Matter) are not 
at all times ready to be had. To giue them some small taste, 
or notice of the rest, let this suffice. 
 
[}SVBSEC. 2. 
 
Division of the Body. 
Humors, Spirits.}] 
 
OF the parts of the Body, there be many Divisions: The 
most approued is that of [/139./] Laurentius, out of Hippocrates: 
That is, into parts Contained, or Containing. Contained; 
[/140./] 
are either Humors, or Spirits. 
 
A Humor is a liquid or fluent part of the Body, comprehended 
in it, for the preservation of it, and it is either innate 
and borne with vs, or adventitious and acquisite. The Radicall 
or innate, is dayly supplied by nourishment, which some 
call Cambium, and make those secundary Humors of Ros 
and Gluten to maintaine it: or acquisite, to maintaine those 
[^p.21^] 
foure first primary Humors, comming and proceeding from 
the first Concoction in the Liuer, by which meanes Chilus 
is excluded. Some divide them into profitable and excrementitious 
Humors, Pituita and Blood profitable; the other two 
excrementitious. But [/141./] Crato out of Hippocrates will haue all 
foure to be juyce, and not excrements, without which no living 
Creature can be sustained: which foure, though they be 
comprehended all in the Masse of the Blood, yet they haue 
their severall affections, for which they are distinguished 
from one another, and from those adventitious peccant, or 
[/142./] diseased humors, as Melancton cals them. 
 
Blood, is a hote, sweete, temperate, red humor, prepared in 
[/143./] 
the Miseriacke veines, and made of the most temperate parts 
of the Chilus in the liuer, whose office is to norrish the whole 
Body, to giue it strength and colour, being dispersed by the 
veines, through every part of it. And from it Spirits are first 
begotten in the Heart, which afterwards by the Arteries, are 
communicated to the others parts 
 
[/144./] 
Pituita, or Fleame, is a cold and moist humor, begotten 
of the colder part of the Chilus, (or white juyce comming of 
the meate digested in the Stomacke) in the Liver, his office 
is to nourish, and moisten the Members of the Body, which 
as the tongue, are mooved, that they be not over-drye. 
 
[/145./] 
Choler, is hote and dry, bitter, begotten of the hotter parts 
of the Chilus, and gathered to the Gall: it helpes the naturall 
heate, and sences, and serues to the expelling of excrements. 
 
[/146./] 
Melancholy, cold and dry, thicke, blacke, sowre, begotten 
of the more fæculent part of nourishment, and purged from 
the Spleene, is a bridle to the other two hote Humors, Blood, 
and Choler, preseruing them in the Blood, and nourishing the 
Bones: These foure Humors haue some Analogy with the 
foure Elements, and to the foure Ages in Man. 
 
To these Humors, you may adde Serum, which is the 
[/147./] 
matter of Vrine, and those excrementitious Humors, of the 
third Concoction, Sweat, and Teares. 
 
Spirit, is a most subtile vapor, which is expressed from the 
[/148./] 
[^p.22^] 
Blood, and the Instrument of the Soule, to performe all his Actions, 
a common tye or medium, betwixt the Body and the 
Soule, as some will haue it, or as [/149./] Paracelsus, a fourth Soul of 
it selfe. Melancthon holds the Fountaine of these Spirits to 
be the Heart, begotten there, and afterward convayed to the 
Braine, they take an other nature to them. Of these Spirits 
there be three kindes, according to the three principall parts, 
Braine, Heart, Liver; Naturall, Vitall, Animall. The Naturall 
are begotten in the Liuer, and thence dispersed through 
the Veines, to performe those naturall actions. The Vitall 
Spirits are made in the Heart of the Naturall, which by the 
Arteries, are transported to all the other parts: if these Spirits 
cease, the Life ceaseth, as in a Syncope or Swouning. The 
Animall Spirits are formed of the Vitall, brought vp to the 
Braine, and diffused by the Nerues, to the other Members, 
giue sence and motion to them all. 
 
[}SVBSEC. 3. 
 
Simular Parts.}] 
 
[/150./] 
COntaining Parts by reason of their more solid substance, 
are either Homogeniall, or Hetrogeniall, Simular, or Dissimular: 
so Aristotle divides them, lib. 1. cap. 1. de hist. Animal. 
Laurentius cap. 20. lib. 1. Simular or Homogeniall, are such, as 
if they be divided, are still divided into parts of the same nature, 
as water into water. Of these, some bee Spermaticall, 
some Fleshy, or Carnall. [/151./] Spermaticall are such as are immediatly 
begotten of the Seed, which are Bones, Grisles, Ligaments, 
Membranes, Nerues, Arteries, Veines, Skinnes, Fibers, 
or Strings, Fat. 
 
[/152./] 
The Bones are dry and hard, begotten of the thickest of 
the Seede, to strengthen and sustaine the other parts: some 
say there be 304, some 307, or 313 in a Mans body. They 
haue no nerues in them, and are therefore without sence. 
 
A Gristle, is a substance softer then Bones, and harder then 
[^p.23^] 
the rest, flexible, and serues to maintaine the parts of motion. 
 
Ligaments, are they that tye the Bones together, and other 
parts to the Bones, with their subseruing tendons: Membranes 
office is to couer the rest. 
 
Nerues or sinewes, are Membranes without, and full of 
[/153./] 
Marrow within, they proceede from the Braine, and carry the 
Animall Spirits for sence and motion. Of these some be harder, 
some softer; the softer serue the sences, and there be seuen 
paire of them. The first be the Opticke Nerues, by which wee 
see; the second moue the Eyes; the third paire serue for the 
Tongue for taste; the fourth paire for taste in the Palate; the 
fift serue the Eares; the sixt paire is most ample, and runnes 
almost ouer all the Bowels; the seuenth paire mooue the 
Tongue. The harder Sinewes serue for the motion of the 
Inner parts, proceeding from the Marrow in the Backe, of 
whom there be thirty Combinations, seuen of the Necke, 
twelue of the Brest, &c. 
 
Arteries, are long & hollow, with a double skin to convay 
[/154./] 
the vitall spirits, to discerne which the better, they say that 
Vesalius the Anatomist was wont to cut vp men aliue. [/155./] They 
arise in the left side of the heart, and are principally two, from 
which the rest are deriued, Aorta and Venosa. Aorta is the 
root of all the other, which serue the whole body; the other 
goes to the lungs, to fetch aire to refrigerate the Heart. 
 
Veines, are hollow and round like pipes, arising from the 
[/156./] 
Liuer, carrying blood and naturall spirits, they feed all the 
parts. Of these there be two chiefe, Vena porta, and Uena Caua, 
from which the rest are corrivated. That Vena porta is a 
Veine, comming from the concaue of the liuer, and receauing 
all those meseriacall veines, by whom he takes the Chilus 
from their stomacke and guts, and conveies it to the Liuer. 
The other convaies blood from the liuer to nourish all the other 
dispersed members. The branches of that Vena porta, are 
the Meseriacall and Hæmorroides. The branches of the Caua, 
are inward, or outward. Inward seminall or emulgent. Outward 
in the head, armes, feet, &c. and haue severall names. 
 
[^p.24^] 
Fibræ or strings, white and solide dispersed through the 
[/157./] 
whole member, and are right, oblique, transuerse, all which 
haue their severall vses. Fat, is a simular part moist without 
blood, composed of the most thicke and vnctuous matter of 
the blood. The [/158./] skinne couers the rest, and hath Cuticulam 
or a little skinne vnder it. Flesh is soft and ruddy, composed 
of the congealing of blood, &c. 
 
[}SVBSECT. 4. 
 
Dissimular parts.}] 
 
DIssimular parts, are those which wee call Organicall or 
Instrumentall, & they be Inward or Outward. The chiefest 
outward parts are situate forward or backward. Inward, 
the crowne and forepart of the head, scull, face, forehead, te~ples, 
chinne, eyes, eares, nose, &c. necke, brest, chest, vpper and 
lower part of the belly, hypocondries, navell, groyne, stanks, 
&c. Backward, the hinder part of the head, backe, shoulders, 
sides, loynes, hyp-bones, os sacrum, buttockes, &c. Or ioynts, 
armes, hands, feet, legges, thighes, knees, &c. Or common to 
both, which because they are obuious and well knowne, I 
haue carelesly repeated, eaq~ præcipua & grandiora tantum, 
quod reliquum, ex libris de anima, qui volet, accipiat. 
 
Inward Organicall parts which cannot be seen, are diverse 
in number, and haue seuerall names, functions, and divisions, 
but that of [/159./] Laurentius is most famous, into Noble or Ignoble 
parts. Of the noble there bee three principall parts to 
which all the rest belong, and whom they serue, Braine, Hart, 
Liuer. According to whose site, three Regions, or a threefold 
division is made of the whole Body. As first of the Head 
in which the Animal Orgaines are contained, and Braine it 
selfe, which by his Nerues giues sense and motion to the rest, 
and is as it were a privy Counsellor, and Chancellour to the 
Heart. The second Region is the Chest, or middle Belly, in 
which the Heart as king keepes his court, and by his Arteries 
[^p.25^] 
communicates life to the whole body. The third Region is 
the lower Belly in which the liuer resides, as a legat a latere, 
with the rest of those naturall Organes, seruing for concoction, 
nourishment, expelling of excrements. This lower Region 
is distinguished from the vpper by the Midriffe, or Diaphragma, 
and is subdiuided againe by [/160./] some into three concauities, 
or regions, vpper, middle, and lower. The vpper of 
the Hypocondries, in whose right side is the Liuer, the left the 
Spleene. From which is denominated Hypocondriacall Melancholy. 
The second of the Navell and Flancks, diuided from 
the first by the Rimme. The last of the watercourse, which is 
againe subdivided into three other parts. The Arabians make 
two parts of this Region, Epigastrium, and Hypogastrium. 
Vpper or lower. Epigastrium they call Mirach, from whence 
comes Myrachialis Melancholia, sometimes mentioned of 
them. Of these seuerall Regions I will treate in briefe and apart. 
And first of the third Region, in which the naturall Organs 
are contained. 
 
But you that are Readers in the meane time, Suppose you 
were now brought into some sacred Temple, or maiesticall Pallace 
[/161./] 
(as [/162./] Melanthon saith) to behold not the matter only, but the 
singular art and workmanship, & counsell of this our great Creator. 
And tis a pleasant and profitable speculation, if it be considered 
aright. The parts of this Region which present themselues 
to your consideration and view, are such as serue to 
nutrition or generation. Those of Nutrition serue to the first 
or second concoction. As the œsophagus or Gullet which 
[/163./] 
brings meat and drinke into the Stomacke. The Ventricle or 
stomacke, which is seated in the midst of that part of the belly 
beneath the Midriffe, the kitchin as it were of the first concoction, 
and which turnes our meat into Chilus: It hath two 
mouthes, one aboue, another beneath. The vpper is sometimes 
taken for the stomacke it selfe; the lower or neather 
dore (as Wecker cals it) is named Pylorus. This stomacke is 
sustained by a large Kell or Kaull, called Omentum. Which 
some will haue the same which Pæritoneum, or rimme of the 
[^p.26^] 
belly. From the Stomacke to the very Fundament, are produced 
the Guts or Intestina, which serue a little to alter and distribute 
the Chilus, and conuay away the excrements. They 
are divided into small and great, by reason of their site and 
substance, slender or thicker. The slender is Duodenum or 
whole gutte, which is next to the stomacke, some twelue inches 
long, saith [/164./] Fucshius. Ieiunum or empty gutt continuate 
to the other, which hath many Meseriacke Veines annexed to 
it, which take part of the Chilus to the liuer from it. Ilion the 
third, which consists of many crinckles, which serues with 
the rest to receaue, keepe, and distribute the Chilus from the 
Stomacke. The thicke guts are three, the Blind gut, Colon, and 
Right gut. The Blinde is a thicke and short gut, hauing one 
mouth in which the Ilion and Colon meet: It receaues the excrements, 
and convayes them to the Colon. This Colon hath 
many windings, that the excrements passe not away to fast. 
The Right gut is straight, and convayes the excraments to 
the Fundament, whose lower part is bound vp with certaine 
Musckles, called Sphincteres, that the excrements may be the 
better contained, vntill such time a man be willing to goe to 
the stoole. In the midst of these guts is situated the Mysenterium 
or Midriffe, composed of many Veines, Arteries, and 
much fat, seruing chiefly to sustaine the guts. All these parts 
serue the first concoction. To the second, which is busied either 
in refining the good nourishment, or expelling the bad, 
is chiefly belonging the Liuer, like in colour to congealed 
blood, the shop of blood, situate in the right Hypocondry, in 
figure like to an halfe moone, Generosum membrum, Melancton 
stiles it; a generous part, it serues to turne the Chilus to 
blood, for the nourishment of the body. The excrements of it 
are either Cholericke or Watery, Which the other subordinate 
parts convay. The Gaule placed in the concaue of the Liuer, 
extracts Choler to it, the Spleene. Melancholy, which is situate 
on the left side overagainst the Liuer, a spungy matter, which 
drawes this blacke choler to it by a secret vertue, and seeds 
vpon it, convaying the rest to the bottome of the stomacke, to 
[^p.27^] 
stirre vp appetite, or else to the guts as an excrement. That 
watery matter the two Kidnies expurgate, by those emulgent 
veines, and Vreteres: The emulgent drawe this superfluous 
moisture from the blood, the two Vreteres convay it to 
the Bladder; which by reason of his site in the lower belly, 
is apt to receaue it, hauing two parts, necke and bottome: the 
bottome holds the water, the necke is constringed with a 
muscle, which as a porter keepes the water from running 
out against our will. 
 
Members of generation are common to both sexes, or peculiar 
to one; which because they are impertinent to my purpose, 
I doe voluntarily omit. 
 
[/165./] 
Next in order is the middle Region, or chest which comprehends 
the vitall faculties and parts: which as I haue said 
is seperated from the lower belly, by the Diaphragma or 
Midriffe, which is a skinne consisting of many nerues, membranes, 
and amongst other vses it hath, it is the instrument of 
laughing. There is also a certaine thinne membrane full of Sinewes, 
which covereth the whole chest within, and is called 
Pleura, the seat of the disease called Pleurisie, when it is inflamed; 
some adde a third skinne, which is called Mediastimus, 
which divides the chest into two parts, right and left. Of this 
Region the principall part is the Heart, which is the seat and 
fountaine of life, of heat, of spirits, of pulse and respiration, 
the Sonne of our body, the king and sole commander of it: 
The seat and organe of all passions and affections, Primum 
viuens vltimum moriens, it liues first and dies last in all creatures. 
Of a paramidicall forme, and not much vnlike to a 
Pineapple, a part worthy of [/166./] admiration, that can yeeld such 
variety of affections, by whose motion he is dilated or contracted, 
to stirre and command the humours in the body. As 
in sorrow, melancholy; in anger, choler; in ioy to send the 
blood outwardly, in sorrowe to call it in; moouing the humours 
as Horses doe a Chariot. This Heart though it bee 
one sole member, yet it may bee divided into two creekes; 
Right and Left. The Right is like the Moone increasing, bigger 
[^p.28^] 
then the other part, and receaues blood from Vena Caua, 
distributing some of it to the Lunges to nourish them, the 
rest to the left side to ingender spirits. The left creeke hath the 
forme of a Cone, and is the seat of life: which as a torch doth 
oyle, drawes blood vnto it, begetting of it spirits and fire; and 
as fire is in a torch, so are spirits in the blood, & by that great 
Artery called Aorta, he sends vitall spirits all ouer the body, 
and takes ayre from the Lungs, by that Artery which is 
called Venosa; So that both creekes haue their vessels, the 
right two Veines, the left two Arteries, besides those two 
common aufractuous eares which serue them both, the one 
to hold blood, the other aire, for seuerall vses. The Lunges is 
a thinne spungy part like an Oxe huffe, saith [/167./] Fernelius, the 
towne Clarke or Crier ([/168./] one tearmes it) the instrument of 
voice, as an Orator to a King annexed to the Heart, to expresse 
his thoughts by voice. That it is the instrument of 
voice, it is manifest, in that no creature can speake, or vtter any 
voice that wanteth these lights. It is besides the instrument 
of respiration, or breathing: and his chiefe office is to 
coole the Heart, by sending aire vnto it, by the Uenosall Artery, 
which veine comes to the lungs by that aspera arteria, 
which consists of many grisles, membranes, nerues, taking in 
aire at the nose and mouth, and by it likewise exhales the 
fumes of the Heart. 
 
In the vpper Region seruing the animall faculties, the 
[/169./] 
chiefe Organ is the Braine, which is a soft marrowish and 
white substance, ingendred of the purest part of seed and spirits, 
included by many skinnes, and seated within the skull 
or braine-pan, and it is the most nobled Organe vnder Heaven, 
the dwelling house and seat of the Soule, the habitation 
of wisdome, memory, iudgement, Reason, and in which man 
is most like vnto God, and therefore nature hath couered it 
with a skull of hard bone, and two skinnes or membranes, 
whereof the one is called dura mater or meninx, the other 
pia mater. The dura mater is next to the skull, aboue the other, 
and includes and protects the braine. When this is tataken 
[^p.29^] 
away the pia mater is to be seene, a thinne membrane, 
the next and immediate couer of the braine, and not couering 
only but entring into it. The Braine it selfe is divided 
into two parts, the fore and hinderpart; the fore-part is much 
bigger then the other, which is called the little braine in respect 
of it. This forepart hath many concavities, distinguished 
by certaine ventricles, which are the Receptacles of the 
Spirits, brought thither by the Arteries from the Heart, and 
are there refined to a more heauenly nature, to performe the 
actions of the Soule. Of these ventricles there be three, Right, 
Left, and Middle. The Right and Left answere to their site, & 
beget animall spirits; if these be any way hurt, sense & motion 
ceaseth. These ventricles moreouer, are held to be the seat 
of the common sense. The Middle ventricle, is a common 
concurse and cauity of both; and hath two passages, the one 
to receaue Pituita, the other extends it selfe to the fourth 
creeke, in this they place Imagination, and Cogitation, and so 
the three ventricles of the forepart of the Braine are vsed. 
The fourth Creeke behinde the head is common to the Cerebell 
or li_[^ORIG. BLANK^]tle braine, and marrowe of the back-bone, the least 
and most sollid of all the rest, which receaues the animal spirits 
from the other ventricles, and convaies them to the marrowe 
in the backe, and is the place where they say the memory 
is seated.
