[}THE 
FIRST PART. 
Of the Diseases from occult 
Qualities in General.}] 
 
[}Chap. 1. Whether there are actions 
from the whol substance, 
or from occult Qualities.}] 
 
SOME confess that there are in nature 
hidden faculties: but how many 
[/1./] 
sorts, and from whence they 
come is not sufficiently explained. 
Galen calls them the Qualities of 
[^p.2^] 
the whole substance, and reproves the Teacher 
Pelops, that bragged more ambitiously then learnedly, 
that he knew the causes of all things. For 
they who endeavor to know that, bring foolish 
rediculous reasons, or deny things confirmed by 
experience. 
 
[/2./] 
Fernelius in the last age learnedly defended occult 
qualities. And Julius Cæsar Scaliger saith it 
is great impudency to bring all things to manifest 
qualities, And I suppose that there is no 
more foolish and detestable opinion in Physick, 
then to determine that the causes of all things 
which happen naturally, are to be fetcht from 
manifest causes and Elements. 
 
For who is so foolish or impudent, that will 
impute the action of the Loadstone drawing iron 
to qualities fetcht from the Elements? Some hate 
Cats, that if they be present (though they see 
them not) they fall into cold sweats, and faint, 
and cannot endure any Cupboard that contains 
them. 
 
Also purging Medicines that purge much in a 
small quantity, and the action of poysons testifie 
the same. And the meanest Physitians know of 
what narcotick quality a few grains of Opium 
are. 
 
From which, and six hundered more Arguments, 
I conclude that these actions are far different 
from the actions of manifest qualities. 
 
[}Chap. 2. Of the Names and 
Nature of occult Diseases.}] 
 
THey are called occult Qualities, because 
their force is known only by their operation 
[^p.3^] 
and effect; but we know them not by sense, 
because they affect the body privately. By Galen 
[/3./] 
they are said to act from the whole substance 
which Valeriola saies, is when there can be no 
[/4./] 
reason given of the acting, but the substantial 
form, as the elementary qualities flow from their 
forms. 
 
Nor are occult qualities to be contemned, 
therefore as the refuge of ignorance, but rather 
our weakness of understanding. And as he that 
[/5./] 
knows that fire warms from its heat, knows truly, 
and is not ignorant. So he that knows that 
a Loadstone draws iron, because it hath a vertue 
so to do, is truly knowing, and not ignorant. 
And in this our darkness, the form of fire and of 
the Loadstone, is alike unknown unto us, for the 
form is a Divine thing, and works, whose exquisite 
knowledg is hid from us; therefore it is the 
part of a fool to search after it. For it is a part of 
[/6./] 
humane Wisedom to be content to be ignorant of some 
things. And the true knowledg of all things is 
only in Eternal Wisdom. 
 
[}Chap. 3. Of the Original of 
occult Qualities.}] 
 
IT is hard and tried by few, to know the original 
of occult qualities: for they come not 
from the first qualities, which way soever mixed 
or tempered, for they cannot produce such 
actions as are in Purges, Poysons and Antidotes, 
either being simple or mixed, so that occult qualities 
should produce effects above the power and 
condition of the Elements. Nor are they from 
the peculiar mixture or unknown measure of the 
[^p.4^] 
temper of the Elements, for these mixtures do 
not change Nature, nor exalt the essence: for it 
is an undoubted truth, that nothing acteth beyond 
the strength of its kind. 
 
Therefore occult qualities flow from their 
forms, which must be sought for. Let us search 
into the differences of the substances in which 
these qualities are, and then it will appear that 
all have not the same original: for some are alive, 
others not, of those that live not, some 
have had life, as Rhubarb, Wormwood. Some 
have not, as Stones, Metals. 
 
1. Therfore occult qualities that come fro~ living 
creatures, are in all the particular Individuums 
of every kind, only as long as they live; as force 
to stop a Ship, is the Remora, while alive, not 
dead. This quality is from the form of the fish 
living, and so it is in the Torpedo. 
 
2. There are other occult qualities proper to 
some living, but not to all of that kind, as some 
hate cheese or wine, or Cats present, though not 
seen. These qualities depend not upon the form, 
but upon the peculiar disposition of the body. 
 
3. Occult qualities are in things without life, 
& depend upon their specifical form, as the force 
of the Loadstone to draw iron, or hang it in the 
air, or to move towards the pole, or the vertues 
of Jewels, Metals and Minerals. 
 
4. There are occult qualities in natural things 
that have lived, and do not, as in Plants and Animals 
which are used in Physick, as in Rhubarb 
to purge choler, in the Elkes hoof against the Epilepsie 
&c. 
 
5. There are occult qualities bred according 
to Nature in living things, both plants and beasts, 
as the venom of a Scorpion, Adder, Tarantula. 
 
[^p.5^] 
6. They are in living Creatures against Nature, 
as the venome of a mad Dog, and of the 
Plague. 
 
These are the divers subjects of occult qualities. 
 
[}Chap. 4. Whether do occult 
Qualities belong to Health?}] 
 
NOt only the elementary qualities concern 
mans health, but the occult; for whatsoever 
conduceth to the natural disposition of the 
parts of mans body, belongs to the health of it. 
For health is as a natural power to exercise natural 
actions, depending upon the constitution 
of the parts according to Nature; or a natural 
disposition of the parts of the body, that hath power 
to exercise natural actions. But to the constitution 
of the parts of mans body, occult properties 
do belong, and many actions are done by 
them. Therefore occult qualities belong to the 
health of man. 
 
[}Chap. 5. Whether are there other 
Diseases then Distemper in 
the similar Parts.}] 
 
FErnelius only (as I know) said that similar 
[/7./] 
parts had other diseases besides distemper, 
for three reasons. 1. In a similar part, besides 
the distemper, are found things that make up its 
constitution, for there is matter and form which 
[/8./] 
may be the subjects of a disease, as temper; for 
the whole substance is the perfection and integrity, 
by which every thing subsists. Therefore 
[^p.6^] 
whatsoever destroys the matter and form, are 
diseases of the whole substance; some are manifest, 
some are hid. The manifest demolish the 
substance of the parts by manifest qualities. The 
occult oppose the whole substance from occult 
causes. 
 
But Fernels reasons onely prove that there are 
diseases from occult qualities, and to be cured by 
the same. As for the first kind, the change and 
corruption of substance causeth not a disease, 
but the destruction of the part, but a corrupt 
thing neither suffers a disease nor health. If the 
corruption is not perfect, but beginning, it is a 
disease of distemper or alteration. 
 
If this destruction of substance come from an 
occult cause, it belongs to diseases of occult qualities 
therefore it is not the corruption of the 
form. 
 
The second reason of Fernel, is from curing: 
Medicines are given, that work by occult qualities, 
that is from the whole substance; therefore 
there are diseases answerable to them: for if 
there were no occult diseases, remedies had been 
invented in vain, which oppose the actions of 
them with their whole substance, as venemous 
diseases, and the plague. To this I answer, a 
preternatural disposition from an occult quality, 
is more properly to be called diseases of occult 
qualities, then diseases of the whole substance or 
form: for it is not affected immediately, onely 
the noble qualities are affected, which the form 
useth for to act by. 
 
Fernels third Argument is from actions hurt: 
for saith he, all actions hurt, are either from the 
disease of the part acting, or from an external error, 
but there are actions which are neither referred 
[^p.7^] 
to diseases of distemper, nor to external 
error. It follows that there are others from 
whence these actions arise, as in malignant and 
pestilent feavers, in which there is often no distemper 
to be observed, and yet strength is so dejected, 
that they often kill. Therefore every poyson 
of it self, as it is poyson, works by an occult 
force, and puts an evil disposition into the body, 
that cannot be cured but by Antidotes But 
it must not be called a disease of the whole substance, 
but a disease of occult qualities. 
 
[}Chap. 6. What Diseases are 
in similar Parts, besides Distemper?}] 
 
SOme Learned men having examined Fernels 
reasons mentioned for diseases of matter and 
form, have seen some falsities in him, and 
therefore have rejected his truths also. I shall 
give my opinion. 
 
If any with Fernel wil cal them diseases of the 
whole substance or form, that have a hidden 
cause, because they destroy the substance and form 
of the part, it cannot be allowed, because they 
affect not the form immediately, as I shewed. 
But they shall say truly, if they shall say that they 
change those noble qualities, which the form useth 
besides the first qualities, and bring in the 
contrary. 
 
That there are such occult qualities and evil 
dispositions appears by what is said, and they 
bring the same into our body, and so alter it, 
that after many years that malignant quality 
hath been observed to revive. 
 
[^p.8^] 
They say so of the English sweating disease, 
that many which scaped it, had a great palpitation 
of the heart two or three years after, others 
all their lives. The same you may see in other 
venemous diseases, and the French pox. For many 
have been seemingly cured, and after twenty 
or thirty years have relapsed, which shews a malignant 
disposition that remained. Galen knew 
this Saying. The least part of deadly poyson 
getting into the body, changeth it all in a moment, 
and alters it with a disease like it self. 
 
[}Chap. 7. Of the Causes and 
Differences of occult Diseases 
in General.}] 
 
OCcult diseases are preternatural dispositions, 
stampt upon the body of man from 
occult qualities, acting otherwaies then by the 
first qualities, and are cured by remedies that act 
occultly. These occult causes are divers, and 
produce divers diseases, as feavers with a cough, 
not deadly, but contagious; so there is an occult 
venom in the French pox, that kils not presently, 
but tormenteth men long. So the Lepers 
die not presently: and there are malignant 
feavers, with, or without the plague. 
 
The causes of occult diseases, are sometimes 
without the body, from the air corrupted by vapors, 
and corrupts the humors, which causeth 
occult diseases; or when they stay with them that 
have an infection, as the Scurvey, Elephantiasis, 
and venom of a mad Dog, the Pox, and the like, 
by which, contagion is carried to others. Also 
poyson from Plants, Minerals, Animals taken in 
do the same. 
 
[^p.9^] 
Or conveighed by a bite or sting of a beast, as 
of a Scorpion, Tarantula, Basilisk. To these you 
may refer diseases by Witchcraft. 
 
There is another difference taken from the 
parts in which the occult qualities lie, by which 
a man is not presently killed, because poyson 
doth not suddenly go to the heart, but to some other 
part, as Spanish flies go to the bladder, Opium 
and evil malignant air to the brain, making 
an Epilepsie; the Sea-hare to the lungs, and the 
French pox to the liver. 
 
Some differences are from the manner and 
force of the action: for deletery poysons have 
forms, which are the principles of acting, but the 
instruments are the hidden vertues that flow from 
these forms, which are unknown to us, except 
only by the effect. Also they act without the 
help of the first qualities, and cure distinguished 
from them. 
 
[}Chap. 8. Of the Signs of occult 
and venemous Diseases in 
General.}] 
 
IF he have been with them that have a contagious 
[/9./] 
disease, or hath taken poyson, or been 
bitten or stung by a venemous beast. 2. If 
no Symptom can be referred to the quality. If 
they be great, and not usual in other diseases. 
3. If they be onely cured with Antidotes that 
work by an occult quality. 
 
You may know if the cause of an occult disease 
be bred in, or brought to the body by the diet 
before, and by his conversing with such as had 
the like disease. 
 
[^p.10^] 
The Symptomes shew what part is chiefly affected. 
If the heart be suddenly smitten, the vital 
faculty is dejected; the pulse is weak, the 
heart beats, the mind is troubled, there is fainting. 
If the brain be affected, there is hurt of sense 
and motion presently, watching and raving. If 
the liver, the colour all over is changed there are 
spots and pustles all over, the urin is changed in 
colour and substance. 
 
The stronger the malignant cause acteth, the 
[/10./] 
shorter is the disease. Whatsoever gets quickly 
to the heart, is dangerous. Every occult disease 
is to be suspected, and also malignant and venemous 
are worse then such as act by manifest qualities. 
 
The greater the Symptoms, the more the danger. 
 
[}Chap. 9. Of the Cure of malignant, 
venemous, and occult 
Diseases in General.}] 
 
YOu must preserve or cure. 
 
Preservatives are excellent in contagions, 
of which hereafter. In diseases that come from 
humors gathered inwardly, you must evacuate 
presently. Poysons that come by chance, can 
scarce be prevented, except you do as Mithridates 
King of Ponius that used Mithridate often, of 
which Cardanus. 
 
If the malignant venom hath pressed the body, 
take it presently away, or abate its force: if 
it be by a humor bred in the body, use Purges or 
Sweats If poyson be drunk, and still in the stomach, 
vomit it up with Oyl or Fat. If it be gotten 
[^p.11^] 
from the stomach to the guts, purge, or give 
Clysters: if it be in the liver, sweat: if it come 
by a little sting or touch, draw it out presently, 
that it pierce not in, of which before. 
 
Give Antidotes in all cases, or proper or common, 
if it be not known. 
 
In sharp poysons taken it, use fat Oyls, but in 
such diseases, look more to the occult then the 
manifest qualities. 
 
If there be other diseases also, as plethory, cacochymy 
or obstruction, give not Antidotes before 
those causes be removed, and it must be done 
very quickly in great poysons. For those causes 
nourish the hidden venom, and oppose the 
strength of Antidotes. 
 
This was the opinion of Eustach Rudius, which 
[/11./] 
I suspect, for you must oppose what is worst and 
urgeth most; therfore give things at first against 
poyson. 
 
Against venemous diseases, we give Antidotes 
simple or compound, called Alexiteria. Simple 
are Angelica roots, Valerian, Swallow-wort, 
Contrayerva, Tormentil, Zedoary, Burnet, Scorzonera, 
white Dittany, Masterwort, Snakeweed, 
Citron peels, Ashen bark, Carduus, Rue, Scordium, 
Sorrel, Galangal, Pauls Bettony. Compounds 
are Mithridate, Treacle, pouder of Saxon, 
Diascordium. Mathiolus his Antidote. Amulets 
by Fernel and Palmar, and the like. 
 
[^p.12^] 
[}THE 
SECOND PART. 
Of Occult, Malignant, 
and venemous Diseases, 
arising from the internal 
fault of the Humors.}] 
 
[}Chap. 1. Of Malignity and Venom 
in general.}] 
 
THAT is malignant that hath 
worse symptoms, and is harder to 
be cured then ordinary. Malignity 
is an adventitious quality to 
a disease that makes beyond its 
nature more difficult or dangerous. 
 
It is from manifest or occult qualities, as when 
an ulcer is in a part only distempered by a manifest 
quality, it may be cacoethick, or of an ill 
condition, but that is only from manifest qualities. 
On the contrary, if a part be stung by a venemous 
[^p.13^] 
beast, or bitten, there wil be an ulcer also, 
but such as is from an occult quality: here 
we shal speak only of malignity that flows from 
occult qualities. 
 
Hence it is cleer that malignity differs from 
poyson, for malignity comes after another disease, 
but poyson by its pernicious force brings a 
hidden disease without another disease, so the 
Plague poyson can kill without a feaver of it 
self, and so wil Hemlock, Napellus. 
 
Poyson therefore is that which of its own 
force by an occult way doth vehemently and immediately 
afflict the body and endanger life, but 
the doubt is whether it be a quality or a substance, 
therefore distinguish it, somtimes it is taken 
for the thing poysoned, somtimes for the 
form of action and hurting our bodies privately. 
If it be taken for the thing poysoned, it is of a 
double nature: some are bodies and act by a 
bodily contract, and though they touch not all 
with their own body, yet they send forth Atoms 
and small bodies that infect, and move to & fro 
in the air in the time of contagion. Others act by 
intentional species, that is, spiritual qualities that 
kill, as the poyson of the Torpedo that benums 
the hand of the Fisher through the Spear. If 
poyson be taken for the venemosity it self, it is 
an occult and dangerous quality. 
 
The differences of malignant and venemous 
diseases are from the effects and causes, for we 
are ignorant of their forms, therefore we shall 
describe every poyson in its proper place by its 
proper signs: but here we shall propound the 
differences of occult diseases fetcht from their 
causes; they are bred in or without the body; 
from evil humors bred in the body are divers 
[^p.14^] 
sorts of malignant feavers, and pestilent feavers, 
and the plague. 
 
The causes without the body are divers both 
malignant and venemous. 1. The air drawn 
in, Inspiration sent out by transpiration. 2. Bad 
water drunk. 3. Contagion or Infection 
a ny way communicated to the body hurts 
secretly. 4. Poysons taken have power to corrupt 
the body. 5. The stingings and bitings of 
venemous creatures, either piercing the body, 
or any other waies hurting, as by sight, hissing, 
venemous breath, or spiritual species. Also venemous 
oyntments with which darts or swords 
are infected: all these poysons are taken from 
Plants, Animals, or Minerals; of which in 
order. 
 
[}Chap. 2. Whether malignant 
venemous humours are bred in 
our bodies.}] 
 
MErcurialis denies it, Fernelius affirms it; 
and they both bring unsatisfying Arguments. 
 
But Rudius decides the controversie in saying, 
they are properly poysons which are such of their 
own nature, and not such as by conception become 
enemies to our bodies. And true poyson 
is only that which is bred without the body. 
 
[/12./] 
Galen seems to favour Fernel against Mercurialis, 
when he saies that poyson is bred in Dogs 
when they are mad, which is very infectious,and 
a pestilent venom breeds of dead carkasses, and 
if poyson breed in a Dog, why not in a man; 
[^p.15^] 
nor is the external agent only requisite for generation, 
but the disposition of the matter is more 
then the outward acting Instrument. 
 
[}Chap. 3. How are malignant 
and venemous humors bred in 
mens Bodies?}] 
 
THerefore since poyson is bred in our bodies 
the difficulty is, how it is bred. 
 
Note first that all the corruptions of our bodies 
are not to be imputed to the matter alone, 
or to the efficient. Somtimes the efficient produceth 
it, when the venemous quality or disposition 
is so fixed that it infects the humors that 
flow to it: but usually venemous humors are 
bred in respect of the matter, and they afterwards 
turn malignant. 
 
Note secondly that there are divers concoctions 
in our body, in which new mixtures are 
made, nor is there a resolution as far as the first 
matter in every mutation or corruption, but 
when any thing corrupteth, only the form, and 
the determinate temper of that form, or the subjects 
with its accidents perish, and others that 
are subordinate remain, some with their accidents: 
hence it is that often some form is manifest 
which lay hid before. And what Hippocrates 
spake of the powers of humors I find 
true in the nature of poyson. In man (saith he) 
[/13./] 
there is bitter, sweet, salt and sour, and six hundred 
more qualities, which according to their plenty and 
strength have other faculties, by mixture of the mutual 
contemperation, nor are these seen, nor do they 
[^p.16^] 
molest, but any of these are separated, and is alone, 
then it is evident, and molesteth a man, &c. thus 
must we dispute concerning poysons. A man 
feeds upon divers Creatures and Plants; the 
Plants are fed by dung of Animals and showers, 
or by floods, and we may find every-where things 
contrary to our bodies in the dung and excrements 
of Animals, in the earth, rain and rivers, 
which are carried with the nourishment into the 
body, and there exercise their force. 
 
[/14./] 
Hippocrates gives an Example of this, As when 
a Woman or a Goat eats wild Cowcumbers, the child 
or the Kid will be purged, because the milk is made 
purging. And though it be first made chyle, then 
blood, and thirdly milk, yet the purging quality 
is kept after so many changes, when the infant 
hath suckt. 
 
From whence it is easie to conclude, that many 
things get into our bodies with the nourishment, 
that have venemous and malignant qualities. 
For how many men do feed upon Mushrooms, 
Melons, and the like, which breed bad 
juyce? How many malignant showers fall upon 
the Plants that feed the Cattel? How many 
beasts that are mans food, eat venemous Plants 
and Creatures? The Stork eats Hemlock, the 
Quail Hellebore, the Ducks Toads which nourish 
them. Hens eat Scorpions and Serpents, 
and when man eats these meats, it is no wonder 
if that poyson which feed them (though after divers 
concoctions it took divers forms) become 
hurtful unto man, and be a kind of poyson in 
him. 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}Chap. 4. Of the Causes of occult 
and venemous Diseases that 
arise from Humors.}] 
 
THese Causes are efficient or material. As 
to the efficients, in regard divers concoctions 
are made, there must be divers excrements, 
according to the variety of the parts, one in the 
liver, another in the heart, another in the stones, 
womb, and the veins and arteries that contain 
blood and Spirits, when they are distempered, 
suffer the blood and Spirits to corrupt, and they 
are distempered by excess or occult malignity, 
by which the solid parts are often corrupted, as 
appears in soul ulcers, gangrens and sphacels. 
 
This evil disposition is somtimes from the parents 
to the children, and they produce evil humors, 
which cause the malignant Scab or Elephantiasis. 
Somtimes it is from meat and drink, 
and venemous medicines that exceed in the first 
qualities, and secretly hurt the body. 
 
The Stars may do the same. For though they 
usually nourish the earth with benigne influences, 
yet by accident they may hurt this or that 
person by occult influences, except they keep a 
[/15./] 
proportion, of which hereafter. 
 
[/16./] 
Hippocrates shews how much the air conduceth 
to the breeding of diseases, saying: That 
change of seasons doth chiefly breed diseases, and 
they are either breathed in, or sent into the body 
by the pores, and the plague comes from the 
air. 
 
Also imagination and passions may be counted 
efficient causes: for frights and anger have 
[^p.18^] 
caused great diseases. And I observed about six 
times, that when the plague was here where I 
live as Professor, that many fell into the plague 
by anger, which (though it be hard to be explained) 
is probable to me. For many bodies 
are of constitutions subject to the plague, either 
by the air or other cause, rather then to another 
disease; and if imagination, fear or anger come 
upon them, this disposition is easily brought into 
act, and the good humors may be corrupted by 
those passions, as Mercurialis shews. 
 
[/17./] 
Cardan mentions hatred among these causes, 
it is a passion made of anger and sadness, and corrupteth 
the humors. 
 
The other cause that corrupteth the humors 
is material, and makes them malignant or venemous, 
and the plague is often bred from bad diet 
in time of famine, which Galen saw under 
[/18./] 
Commodus the Emperor. Also Cowcumbers and 
Pompions produce humors as bad as poyson, if 
they lie long in the body. 
 
Also good meat not well digested in the stomach, 
may cause bad chyle, and good blood is 
never made of bad chyle, but a humor or green 
choler, which is burnt and corrupted in the liver, 
and mixed with the blood, and when it rests 
in the veins, it is scarce perceived, but when it is 
stirred by the motion of the body or mind, it is 
worse, and corrupts more, and is separated from 
the good humors, and brings great diseases, and 
sudden death. 
 
But meats that have in themselves a malignant 
venemous quality, as Mushrooms, Froggs do this 
much more. 
 
[^p.19^] 
[}Chap. 5. Of the differences of 
Diseases that come from the internal 
fault of the Humors.}] 
 
THere are two chief differences of Diseases 
from internal humors. The first are malignant, 
but kill not, onely cause greater Symptoms 
then the first qualities can produce, with 
these a man may live long. 
 
The second are such as presently kill, and are 
well called Venemous. 
 
Of the first sort are the humors that cause an 
Epilepsie, fear of water, dancing, madness, Scurvey, 
Colick, and malignant Dysenteries, Elephantiasis, 
Gangrene, and simply malignant Fevers. 
Of the second sort, are the humors that beget 
pestilent feavers, and the plague. 
 
As for the first sort, the Epilepsie and the other 
diseases are not the evident causes, or from obstruction 
of the ventricles of the brain, nor is fear 
of water, from the biting of a mad Dog. But this 
Epilepsie is from a humour or vapor that hurts 
the membranes of the brain, and the nerves especially. 
And fear of water may come from internal 
humors without the biting of any mad creature. 
Mercellus Donatus hath five Examples of 
[/19./] 
this, and the diseases mentioned are not from 
manifest qualities, but from malignant, occult 
and venemous causes. 
 
As for the second kind, the humors are so corrupted, 
that they do not only turn malignant, but 
breed deadly diseases, that kil like poyson, as pestilent 
Feavers and the Plague, Buboes and Carbuncles, 
of which before. 
 
[^p.20^] 
[}Chap. 6. Of the Signs of diseases 
that come from malignant 
venemous Humors that are bred 
in our Bodies.}] 
 
THe signs of these diseases are from the causes 
mentioned in the fourth Chapter, especially 
from the air, which if it keep not its natural 
constitution, the humors must needs be corrupted, 
as experience confirms. 
 
Another sign is when famine hath been either 
by scarcity or siege, and men have had an ill diet, 
the inward humors are corrupt. 
 
The third is, when no manifest Cause went 
before, and the man had not to do with any man 
of the like disease, and there are the signs of malignity 
[/20./] 
and venom, it shews that it is from the internal 
fault of the humors. 
 
And by comparing the strength with the disease, 
you may know the event of the disease. 
 
[}Chap. 7. Of the Preservation 
from, and Cure of these Diseases.}] 
 
VVEE have shewed the Cure largely 
before, only if there be a malignant 
or Epidemical disease stirring, either from air or 
bad diet, or the like, let it be removed by convenient 
Evacuations, lest the humors corrupt. And 
observe from what cause the fault is, that you 
may apply fit remedies: as Pills de Tribus, Rhubarb, 
[^p.21^] 
and Syrup of Roses, and the like. These 
must be repeated at a distance, and good Antidotes 
used. 
 
After purging, it is good to sweat, and take 
heed of anger, fear or passions, which stir up the 
humors that lie stil and close, and make a plague 
without any society with them of the plague.

[}THE THIRD PART. 
Of occult Diseases from 
Water, Air, and Infections, 
and of infectious 
Diseases.}] 
 
[}Chap. 1. Of occult and malignant 
Diseases, and Venom that 
arise from Waters.}] 
 
MANY Diseases come from 
bad waters, as Dysentery and 
Dropsie and malignant Diseases 
also, as the Scurvey. 
Marsh standing Pools easily 
corrupt, and the drinking 
thereof in Armies, causeth 
malignant pestilent Feavers, 
because they are infected by Froggs, Toads and 
Serpents, and other venemous Creatures. 
 
Also Waters are unwholsom, in which Flax or 
Hemp are steeped. And some Fountains have 
killed them that have drunk thereof, and therefore 
the Waters of the River Styx are so odious, 
among Poets. Pausanias and other Historians 
mention of many poysons that wil infect waters 
 
[^p.23^] 
You may cure these Waters by boyling the~ or 
quenching steel, or stone, or iron in them when 
you are in Armies, or on a Journey, and cannot 
boyl them, at least you may strain them. 
 
And if any have drunk such Waters, let him 
presently take an Antidote. 
 
[}Chap. 2. Of malignant Diseases 
from the Air.}] 
 
AIr as it is a pure Element, neither corrupts, 
nor is infectious; but it may be corrupted 
[/21./] 
by other things. 
 
Paris is seldom free from the Plague, by reason 
of inundations, for besides the stink of the 
mud, all the Jakes of the City are full of stinking 
water, that go not into the Common-shore, 
but to the Gates of the City, and cause a stink, 
especially in hot weather. 
 
Also malignant vapors arise from Dens and 
Caves, saith Mercurialis, he had seen many Caves 
[/22./] 
near Rome, into which, if either man or beast go, 
they presently die. 
 
The air becomes pestilent, when the smal bodies 
that use to be in the air (that of themselves 
are not venemous) do corrupt. 
 
These are all dangerous diseases, and none can 
be secure from them, for none can live without 
air. Therefore let such as by reason of their imployments, 
or the like, cannot flie, never go abroad, 
but with good Antidotes in their mouths 
and anointed about their noses. 
 
[^p.24^] 
[}Chap. 3. Of Contagion.}] 
 
IN contagious diseases. 1. There is the disease 
which is called Contagious, because it 
infects another with the same disease. 2. 
There is the Medium by which the like disease is 
produced in another. 3. There is the action by 
which the like disease is produced in another. 
And lastly the disease which is produced in another. 
A contagion is an infection, or a body 
sent from a sick body, that can produce the like 
disease in another. 
 
To clear this. 1. Consider the contagious 
body. 2. The infection by which it doth infect 
another. 3. The body that is infected. 
 
1. The contagious body is not onely a man, 
but an Ox or Sow, or the like. And that is only 
contagious that can breed any thing in it self, 
which being sent to another of the same kind, 
produceth the like disease. 
 
2. When that Contagion passeth to another 
body, with which it hath some likeness, the passage 
is by infection or seed, in which there is force 
to act by the quality that flows from the force. 
But we are ignorant of that quality and the form 
from whence it flows: therefore it is truly called 
an occult Quality. For this quality and form 
are in as smal a body as an Atome, and is so called; 
and as one saith, The infection of diseases 
is multiplied by little bodies, that like seeds, 
comprehend the whole essence of the disease. 
 
Now the quality by which the infection acts 
so powerfully, is not manifest; for no manifest 
quality hath such force; but it is occult, and not 
sensible, but known only by the effect. Nor can 
[^p.25^] 
you say that this infection is the effect of rottenness, 
for that putrefaction be made many alteration 
are required, and long time. But Contagion 
taken in suddenly infecteth, and often kills, 
and begets the like contagious humor in the party; 
and works like contagious poyson before 
there is any putrefaction wrought, as appears in 
the Plague. 
 
This Miasma or Contagion is spred and sowed 
about, by the pores of the skin. Somtimes it 
comes forth with the sweat, or sticks to the skin 
with a thicker excrement or filth. Somtimes it 
goes out of the body by the breath: somtimes by 
matter or quittor that comes out of the ulcers. 
Somtimes those Atomes flie about in the air, and 
therefore the seeds of the Plague are sowed far about. 
 
A Contagion or Miasma is sowed and spred 
abroad two waies, either by fewel alone, or by 
the air, and by its fewel. This fewel is not the 
subject of that form, but gives a place to the contagion. 
Such are all things that are porous and 
thin, as wool, flax, cotten, feathers, hairy beasts 
skins, and walles may receive Contagion, as experience 
shews: and some solider things, as stones 
and Metals, but then they are foul, for when they 
are clean from filth, they cannot receive it so easily. 
 
3. The body that is infected, and receiveth 
the same disease thereby, is somwhat like it. For 
it is received into garments, wool, but the like 
disease is not produced in them, because they 
have no Analogy with the body infecting. Nor 
doth the same Contagion infect all alike, for the 
Plague which in Sows infects not men nor Oxen, 
and that which infects men, infects not Hogs 
[^p.26^] 
nor Oxen. And all men, and are disposed to receive 
all Contagions, but the kindred are most 
fit to receive, by reason of the agreement of humors. 
 
[}Chap. 4. Of the Differences 
of infectious Diseases.}] 
 
IN co~tagious diseases there is an excreme~t bred 
which like a vapor or little body, or by silth, 
infects another body with the same disease. 
Catarrhs are often contagious, and malignant 
pestilent Feavers, sore Eyes, Consumption, Dysenteries, 
Scurvey, Scabs, Itch, scald Heads, Arabian 
Leprosie, Dogs madness, the French pox, 
of which we spake before in a Treatise in Folio 
in English. 
 
[^p.27^] 
[}THE 
FIFTH PART. 
Of outward Poysons in 
General.}] 
 
[}Chap. 1. Of the Nature of 
Poyson.}] 
 
I Had thought to have concluded 
this Epitome with the 
French pox; but when I found 
many things remarkable concerning 
poyson, I thought 
good to set them forth. There 
are many Authors of the 
same, but they follow not the Method of Sennertus. 
 
First, what things are accounted poysons? 
[/23./] 
Some think Bezoardick Medicines and Purges 
are to be reckoned among poysons. For the understanding 
of this: 
 
Observe first, that Galen used the word deadly 
for that which may kil, or that which may do 
good somtimes, though it may kil by accident. 
 
Note secondly, that some Medicines alwaies 
[^p.28^] 
hurt, and never do good; these are poyson, and 
so must be called. But they which somtimes do 
hurt, are not to be accounted poysons, and they 
which somtimes do good, are not to be excluded 
from the number of poysons. For there is a difference 
of things hurtful in general, as Saffron 
chears the heart. But if you take too much of it 
in meat, it hurts. As a Merchant who bought a 
great deal of Saffron, & cast a great deal into the 
porridg-pot against supper, and after he had supped, 
fel into such a laughter, that he almost died 
thereby. The same is to be thought of some purges 
and Bezoardicks, that have no occult quality 
against the body, which by the excess of good 
qualities, do hurt: these are not to be counted 
poysons. 
 
Therefore poyson is whatsoever is apt to hurt us 
[/24./] 
much by an occult quality. Or thus, it is that which 
corrupts the complexion, not only by a quality, but 
by a propriety; for it is necessary to the Nature 
[/25./] 
of poyson alwaies to kill men, but to hurt much 
only. 
 
They define not poyson rightly, that say it is 
that which can kill a man presently by an occult 
quality, or that can by a property corrupt the 
heart suddenly. Some are enemies to the brain, 
and cause madness: others are enemies to other 
parts. 
 
But how comes poyson to the heart? It is either 
[/26./] 
drawn by the heart, or goes to it being carried 
by its hurtful quality, or by both. It is probable 
that all poyson being active from the destructive 
form it hath against the heart, turns every 
thing it toucheth in mans body into poyson, 
and multiplies it self, for spiritual things 
have great force to multiply by Species or Atomes, 
[^p.29^] 
as appears in Musk; but it chiefly hurts 
that part with which it hath the greatest Antipathy. 
 
Have poysons power to nourish? Some deny 
[/27./] 
it, and bring reasons against experience. For the 
Ægyptians eat Vipers; and there are a people 
that are Serpent-eaters near the red Sea called 
Candæans. And the Maid that fed upon Napellus, 
that she might kill Kings that lay with her, 
[/28./] 
and the like shew the truth of this. And he that 
takes these for fables, makes himself a fable. 
 
There are divers poysons, some have no nourishment 
at all, but are wholly contrary to Nature, 
as Arsenick. Some have nourishing parts 
that are taken with the poyson, these may nourish, 
especially if they be accustomed by degrees 
to them. And Galen gives no other reasons, but 
that Nature may be made acquainted with poyson 
by degrees, and be nourished by them. 
 
[}Chap. 2. Of the Differences 
of Poysons.}] 
 
SOme are poysons in their own Nature. Others 
are so by corruption, as rotten fish and 
stinking flesh. 3. There are poysons made by 
art, by boyling and sublimation, we shall speak 
only of those that are of their own Nature poysons. 
 
Some are Minerals or Metals, as Arsenick. Others 
are Plants, as Napellus. Others are from 
Animals, as Scorpions, Vipers. 
 
Secondly, they either act by the first qualities, 
or by hidden qualities, or by both together, but 
this division is false. For poysons are not to be 
[^p.30^] 
judged by their first qualities, but by their contrariety 
[/29./] 
in the whole substance. Moreover they 
are all enemies to the heart or some determinate 
part, but as they are hot, cold, moist or dry, they 
hurt all, but not as poysons. For though manifest 
and occult qualities may be in the same 
subject, yet their effects must not be confounded. 
For with their manifest qualities they heat, 
cool, dry, or moisten, but kill with the occult 
qualities, or hurt very much. 
 
The third difference, is from the effects, for 
their forms are hidden from us, and shew themselves 
by their operations Hence some are enemies 
to the heart, and kill men presently. Others 
are enemies to the brain, as furious Nightshade, 
[/30./] 
Dogs poyson. Others hurt the Liver, as 
the plant that purgeth blood. And some poyson 
hath Antipathy against all parts. 
 
The fourth difference; some poysons are 
deadly, others not. Nor is it true, that all poysons 
either kill or make fit for death, for as it is 
in Chap. 1. Many do but hurt greatly, and cause 
[/31./] 
onely folly and doting, so that with them they 
may live long. Some kil sooner or later, by hurting 
greatly a member that is simply necessary to 
life, as the heart, liver, lungs or stomach, &c. 
 
Fiftly, some kill presently, others at distance, 
as a grain of Nubia, which being divided among 
ten men, kills them all in a quarter of an hour, 
such is Arsenick and the poyson of an Adder. Among 
[/32./] 
them that kill at a distance, is the poyson 
of a mad Dog that often lies hidden many years. 
 
[^p.31^] 
[}Question. Whether are there such Poysons by 
Art or Nature, that can kill a man at a certain 
time?}] 
 
I think it cannot be, for though all natural 
things have their circuits, and that there are the 
beginnings and ends of actions, they are for the 
most part unknown, and cannot be determined 
in this darkness of mans mind. Moreover the agent 
and patient concur in every action, and because 
the actions of active things are not out in 
a disposed patient, and the mans body, in respect 
of the circumstances, hath more or less power to 
resist, it cannot be that the same poyson should 
kill somtimes sooner, somtimes later. 
 
The sixth difference, is from the manner of 
poysons getting in: some are taken at the mouth 
with meat: some come from without, many waies. 
Some venemous beasts leave their poysons upon 
Plants; as it was reported of a young man that 
was talking with his Sweet-heart, and rub'd his 
[/33./] 
gums with Sage, and fell down dead. The Gardner 
found a great Toad under the Sage that infected 
it. 
 
Some poysons hurt by touch, rubbing, or anointing. 
The Turks have a poyson so strong, 
that by touching onely, it kills a man the same 
day. It is reported of the Son of the King of 
[/34./] 
Cambaia, that was nourished with such poyson, 
that he was all over poyson, so that the flies that 
touched his skin, swelled and died. 
 
It is a question how poysons should kill only 
by the vapor: it is either from the material quality, 
or the spirital species that poyson, kils. For 
some poysons, like Atomes and little bodies, exercise 
[^p.32^] 
their force, whether it be in fume, vapor, 
or dust, or in a Juyce or Oyntment, and the venemous 
quality is in that little body, as in a subject. 
For when such a quality depends upon its 
form, it cannot be moved but with the same. 
 
[}Chap. 3. Of the Signs.}] 
 
POyson is either taken unawares, or given by 
subtility and stealth by wicked men. And 
this is a common sign, it presently makes a great 
change in the body, by which it differs from those 
that are bred from humors in the body by putrefaction. 
For in poyson bred in the body, the symptoms 
arise by degrees, not altogether, but by 
succession; but in poyson taken from without, 
many Symptomes appear together from Nature 
stirred up by the poyson with horrid and turbulent 
vomiting, overturns all that she may send 
out her enemy. 
 
And we may suspect poyson, when a sound 
[/35./] 
man bred up well without foul humors, shal suddenly 
have his actions and things voided, and 
retained, altered, and the qualities, presently the 
motion of the heart and pulse is disorderly, without 
any other apparent cause. The strength 
fails, the pulse is either depraved or abolished, 
with beating of the heart, fainting and death. 
Some have Megrims, Convulsions, Trembling, 
Hickets, biting, stomach-pain, and guts griping-stoppage 
of urin, vomiting of choler, or the like, 
somtimes loosness of belly. Cold sweats, and 
chilness, swollen tongue, black and inflamed lips, 
swollen belly, and body often, with spots. All 
these Symptomes are worse then such as come 
from poyson bred with in. 
 
[^p.33^] 
Poyson from biting or stinging of venemous 
beasts have other signs, there is presently pain in 
the part. It is inflamed, and rots, and mortifies, 
except you have present remedies. 
 
Poysons at a distance called Temporary, have 
their conjectures, though no certain signs, by the 
effects. There are often long diseases without 
reason: or folly, madness, or Epilepsie, running 
pains, and Consumption. But the poysons that 
affect the lungs, cause a dry cough and tongue, 
thirst, spitting of blood, and Consumption, and 
other poysons that hurt other parts, are known 
by the actions of those parts hurt. 
 
Whether may one killed by poyson be discovered 
certainly? Galen thought they might be 
known to be poysoned, when he writes thus: 
A man of his own nature abounding with good humors, 
and well educated, and fed, when he dies suddenly 
(as they use to do that take deadly poyson) If 
his body be blew or blackish, or of divers colours, or 
stink, they say he is poysoned. From which words 
[/36./] 
we may gather, that Galen thought that men 
poysoned, might be discovered. But the best 
way to make it manifest, is to open the body, and 
have an expert and wise Physitian. 
 
[}Chap. 4. Of the Prognosticks.}] 
 
TO prognosticate artificially, consider the 
Nature of poysons, and differences. Some 
hurt more, others less; some sooner, some later. 
 
1. They that set upon the heart kill presently, 
or are overcome. They that assault the liver 
or lungs, last longer. They which hinder breathing, 
quite kill presently. 
 
[^p.34^] 
The second difference is from the great, mean 
or small quantity of the poyson. 
 
3. The more and the greater the Symptoms, 
the sooner and certainer is death, as sounding, 
chilness, cold sweat, turning of the eyes. If these 
come together, there is no hope, and the more 
they increase, the worse it is. If they decrease, 
there is some hope. 
 
4. It is a sign of death, if after the poyson is 
taken, there is no vomiting, or purging, or voiding 
any thing, though means have been used. 
There are other prognosticks which are manifest 
from what hath been said. 
 
[}Chap. 5. Of Preservation from 
Poyson.}] 
 
THey that will be preserved from poyson, 
let them keep close to Cardans Rules. 
[/37./] 
 
The safest way is to use Antidotes, as Mithridates 
did Mithridate, so that he could not be poysoned. 
There are divers Antidotes internal and external. 
Albertus Magnus speaks of the external, 
as the Diamond, Topas, Smaragd worn 
constantly upon the bare skin, no poyson can hurt 
that man. Some precious stones keep men from 
[/38./] 
infectious air. These are worn for Amulets: 
and if poyson be near, they sweat. 
 
Treacle and Mithridate are the best inward, 
and Galen saith that none can be poysoned that 
[/39./] 
take as much as a Bean every day of Treacle and 
bids them use it in time of health. And experience 
shews that you may safely give preservatives 
against poyson to sound bodies, and by them 
they get an incredible propriety to resist poyson 
 
[^p.35^] 
Some of these Antidotes are without any excess 
of quality, as Bezoar stone, sealed Earth, Bole, 
Harts-horn, Smaragds, and the like. These are 
given safely to all bodies. Mithridate and Treacle, 
though they be less hot, by reason of the fermentation, 
yet take heed that by the too much 
use, you do hurt thereby. 
 
[}Chap. 6. Of the Cure of Poyson 
in General.}] 
 
SOme make differences between Bezoardicks 
and Antidotes, and say that Bezoardicks act 
not against poyson, but only strengthen the body 
to expel it: and they help only by accident. 
Some say that Bezoardicks fight against poyson, 
[/40./] 
and are wholly against them. 
 
Antidotes are hurtful in too great a quantity, 
and are in some sort against the heart, but both 
by use are good in venemous diseases; as all 
Cordials, Bezoar stone, Harts and Unicorns-horn, 
&c. 
 
Some Antidotes are proper against some peculiar 
poysons, and all strengthen the heart to resist 
poyson: as Tormentil roots, white Dittany, Borage, 
Bugloss, Sorrel, Scabious, Borage and Bugloss flowers, 
Violets, Roses, Waterlillies, Gilliflowers, Citron 
and Basil seeds, Wood-aloes, juyce of Citrons, 
Pomegranates, Oranges, Quinces, Saffron, Cinnamon, 
Cloves, Harts-horn, bone of a Stags heart, 
Ivory, Pearl, Musk, Amber, Coral, Hyacinths, 
Smaragds, Saphirs, sealed Earth, Bole. Many of 
them resist poyson, and Compounds made of 
them. 
 
And though hot must be given against cold 
[^p.36^] 
and cold against hot poysons, yet you must not 
so much look at the manifest qualities as to that 
force which is in medicines, to oppose poyson in 
the whole substance. Therefore in hot poysons 
you may give Treacle and Mithridate: and if the 
poyson will give leave, first abate the Cacochymy. 
 
Lastly, let him that hath taken poyson, either 
at the mouth, or other waies, sleep but little; 
for he must constantly take medicines, and observe 
whether the Symptoms increase, or abate 
by the Bezoardicks, more of which hereafter. 
 
[}Chap. 7. Of the Cure of Poyson 
taken in at the mouth.}] 
 
WHen any one thinks he hath taken poyson, 
let him presently have a Vomit, before the 
poyson exercise its cruelty, and let it be repeated 
often, and made of things that may dull the 
sharpness of the poyson; as of fat Broaths, Oyl, 
Butter-milk boyled, Broom, Dill, Jesamine flowers, 
Radishes, and the like, to which you may add Bezoardicks, 
so that they stop not vomiting. Therfore 
make choice of things that bind not, as 
Harts-horn, Bezoar stone. 
 
If the poyson get to the stomach and guts, give 
Clysters. As, Take Mallows, Pellitory, Althæa, 
each two handfuls; boyl them in water, strain them, 
to a pint and half, add Oyl six ounces, Electuary of 
Fleabane two drams, make a Clyster. And purge 
thus: Take Scorzonera roots two drams, Sorrel 
half a handful, Agarick two drams, Zedoary, Citron 
seeds, each a scruple; Cordial flowers a pugil: 
boyl them, strain, and ad to four ounces, Manna two 
[^p.37^] 
ounces, strain it again, and add Syrup of Citron-peels. 
 
While these are doing, anoint every third 
hour the heart, feet, hands and temples, and places 
where you feel the arteries beat, with Oyl of 
Scorpions, of which Mathiolus, it is excellent. 
 
Let the reliques of the poyson be driven from 
the heart and bowels by sweats, and leave not 
sweating til the evil disposition be quite conquered. 
 
For diet, give Milk for meat and drink, and fat 
meats, Butter and Oyl, Borage, Bugloss, Figs with 
Cordials, Harts-horn, Coral, Pearl, Hyacinths, 
Smaragds, Zedoary, Saffron, Citron peels. 
 
[}Chap. 8. Of the Cure of Poyson 
from without.}] 
 
THat poyson may not creep in, draw it out 
presently by Medicines and Chirurgery. 
As, Take Galbanum, Sagapenum, Mirrh, Pellitory, 
each half an ounce; Pigeons dung three ounces, 
Calamints a dram, dissolve the Gums in Vinegar, 
and with Honey and Oyl make a Cataplasm. 
 
Or apply Chickens or Kids cut in two hot to 
the part where the poyson is. 
 
These laid on, work by a hidden quality, oyl 
of Scorpions, Spiders, and the Creatures that 
poysoned applied to the part. Galen saith that 
[/41./] 
he knew the biting of a Crocodile cured by the grease 
of a Crocodile, and the sting of a Scorpion, by the 
Scorpion applied to the part. These act by the likeness 
of substance. 
 
You must continue the use of things that draw 
out poyson, till pain, evil colour, and other 
[^p.38^] 
Symptoms cease, and there is laudable quittor 
in the part. And to keep the poyson from runing 
inward or about, tie the vessels above: then 
cut off the part that is poysoned, if it may be 
done with safety. Give Antidotes at first to drive 
poyson from the heart, and kil it, and to take away 
the venemous quality that is in the body. 
And if an ulcer follow a bite or venemous sting, 
keep it long open, scarifie it, and burn it as shall 
be shewed. 
 
Poyson taken by scent, must be opposed by 
contrary scent, as Mirrh, Amber, Musk, Ambergreece, 
Civet, Rue, Asphaltum, Wood-aloes, 
Sanders, Cloves, Saffron, Storax, and the mouth 
being shut, you must take the scent of these at 
the nose. Of these we shall speak in the special 
or particular Cure of Poysons. 
 
Sennertus concludes this general Doctrine of 
poysons, with relation of diseases that come from 
fear and frights, because they are like poysons, 
[/42/] 
and he reports out of Cardan, that when a man 
is frighted by Ghosts, or the like, the heat is 
drawn in, and the mind is troubled, and he becomes 
dumb; and if the fright be great, the outward 
parts are cold, and contracted, and the hair 
falls off, and if the body be cacochymick, he is 
very sick, and if strength fails, he dies. This he 
confirms by many Histories which I have left 
out, only I shal relate one of which I was an eye 
witness. When I studied in Physick in Oxitan, 
Anno 1617. a woman that grew melancholick 
from anger, hung her self, the Crowner sitting 
upon her, sentenced her to be hung in gibets, about 
a mile from the City. Another woman 
that was her familiar acquaintance, seeing her 
out of a window, near the place, cryed out, and 
[^p.39^] 
fell into a great Diarrhæa suddenly, with a constant 
dotage that could not be cured. From 
whence I conclude, that in these diseases from 
terror, the heart is not only affected, as Cardanus 
thought, but the brain also. Hence they usually 
give Epileptick Waters: this is good for children. 
Take Tile-flower water, Piony, black Cherry 
water, each an ounce and half; Pearl prepared, 
Coral and Harts-horn, each a scruple; Fecula of 
Piony half a scruple.

[}THE 
SIXTH PART. 
Of Poysons from Minerals 
and Metals.}] 
 
[}Chap. 1. Of unsleaked Lime.}] 
 
VNSLEAKED Lime hath 
some venom in it, though it 
is a stone, and may be reckoned 
among poysons for its 
malignant quality; also it 
hath fire in it, that wil burn. 
 
[}Symptoms and Signs.}] 
This taken into the body, 
afflicteth grievously, for it corrodes and vexeth 
the stomach and guts, and causeth unquenchable 
thirst, bitterness of mouth and tongue, roughness, 
[/43/] 
cough, want of breath, Dysentery, stoppage 
of urin, swounding and choaking. A child 
of eight years old supposed it to be Chalk, and 
eat much, and died the sixth day with these symptoms. 
 
[/44/] 
Provoke vomit with things that abate the 
sharpness of the Lime: give the warm Decoction 
of Violets, Mallows, Althæa, Lineseed, Rice, Oyl, 
fresh Butter, and Mucilages of Lineseed, Mallows, 
Althæa, Fleabane, and keep the belly open with 
[^p.41^] 
Cassia, or a Clyster with Barley water, and Mallows 
roots and all, Mucilage of Fleabane, Cassia lignea, 
Waterlillies, and the like. 
 
The Antidotes are, the gal of a Kid, from a scruple 
to a dram, and the gall of an Hart or Deer a 
scruple drunk with warm Water, Earth of Lemnos 
two drams with Milk. 
 
Give fresh Butter and sat Broaths in which Mallows 
is boyled. 
 
[}Chap. 2. Of Gipsum.}] 
 
THey who have drunk of this or eaten it with 
Wheat flour, have all died. 
 
[}The Signs and Symptoms.}] 
 
A great cough, driness of tongue and jawes, 
great pain about the stomach, hickets, stretching 
of the Hypochondria, binding of the belly, dulness 
and dotage, fainting, and they die choaked. 
 
Give warm Water with much Butter, or Oyl of 
[/45/] 
sweet Almonds, or Oyl of Lillies which will make 
them vomit it up. But because it sticks fast, give 
stronger Vomits, as Hellebore. If it be gotten 
to the guts, give emollient Clysters. Some give 
[/46./] 
a dram of Scammony, with two drams of Fleabane in 
a Julep. Then give Fats to make the passage slippery; 
as the Decoction of Mallons, Althæa, Fænugreek 
seed, fat Broaths, Goats milk, juyce of Mallows, 
Decoction of Dates and Figs. 
 
These are specifick, Organ given in Vinegar 
and honied Wine, Lixivium of Vine ashes or Figtree 
ashes, with sweet Wine and Treacle, or Mithridate, 
from half a dram, to two drams in Sack. 
 
[^p.42^] 
[}Chap. 2. Of Vitriol.}] 
 
[/47./] 
AMong Salts we reckon Vitriol, Chalcitis, 
Misy, Sory, Melanteria, it participates of 
the nature of Brass or Iron, and mineral Clay: 
this is not properly poyson, for good medicines 
are made of it, in which there are no signs of venom, 
[/48./] 
and if it be given a dram with Honey it 
kils the flat worms, and with water it is the Antidote 
against Mushrooms. 
 
[}The Symptoms and Signs.}] 
It causeth loathing and vomiting, and corrodes 
the stomach, except it be perfectly cast up 
it torments the guts, and causeth a Dysentery 
and great thirst. 
 
[/49./] 
Let it be presently vomited up with the Decoction 
or Oyl of Dill, or Wormwood water, 
after vomiting, take much Butter or warm Milk 
with Sugar; if there be a gnawing in the guts, 
give Clysters of Barley water, Mallows and oyl of 
Roses. If you suspect malignity, give Earth of 
Lemnos or sealed Earth, with mucilage of Quince 
seeds a dram, with Barley water, or red Coral with 
Wine. 
 
[}Chap. 4. Of Aqua fortis.}] 
 
THis kils by corroding rather then by poyson, 
it is used by Gold-smiths to seperate 
and corrode metals. 
 
[}Symptoms and Signs.}] 
It pierceth so that it burns the tongue like fire, 
and corrodes the tunicles of the Stomach and 
Guts, a Maid died by it in great torment. 
 
[^p.43^] 
The mucilage of Quince seeds is good, for it lenifies 
and keeps the parts from corrosion by its 
sliminess. Or the eclegma of the mucilage of Althæa 
and Quince seeds, Gum traganth made with 
Rose water, Honey of Roses and Violets: Or a 
Gargarism of Quince seed, Althæa, Cowcumber 
seed, Roses, Violets and Moulin, and of Self-heal, 
Lungwort, Sanicle boyled in water with Honey of 
[/50./] 
Roses. By this a Mariner was cured when he 
had dangerous symptoms from Aqua fortis. 
 
[}Chap. 5. Of Antimony.}] 
 
ANtimony is reckoned by many among 
poysons from its moving of such horrible 
vomiting of water, and because it leaves such 
great weakness after it, but good medicines are 
made of it though it be not free from malignity, 
as appears by the vapors that fly from it when it 
is melted. 
 
[}The Signs and Symptoms.}] 
For when the Chymists melt it, if the vapor 
be taken in at the nose, it causeth Suffocation, 
Palsie, and Epilepsie, and other symptoms: If 
it be taken crude, it causeth Vomiting, Convulsion, 
Colicks, and fainting. 
 
[/51./] 
To keep evil vapors from hurting such as use 
Antimony, let them eat Bread and Rue. Or, 
take Bezoar water with Bole. Or this, Take 
Walnuts a handful, beat them with Honey, add 
Treacle an ounce, Zedoary half an ounce, Cloves, 
Nutmeg, each two drams; with Honey make an Electuary, 
this is a preservative, and it may be used 
to anoint the nostrils. 
 
If it be given crude or ill prepared, it causeth 
[^p.44^] 
evil symptomes, then give Bailey water with 
syrup of Roses, to clense, and clensing Clysters: 
then strengthen the Guts and Stomach, with 
Wine wherein Cloves and Mastich is boyled: 
the Antidotes are Treacle and Bole Armeniack two 
scruples.
