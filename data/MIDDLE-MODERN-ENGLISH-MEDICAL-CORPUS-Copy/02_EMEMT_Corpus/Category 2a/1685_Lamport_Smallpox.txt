[}THE 
CURE 
OF THE 
Small-POX.}] 
 
I Having written a small Treatise concerning the many 
gross Abuses and dangerous Errors, commonly 
used amongst such as do pretend to the Curious 
Art of Healing, discovering the evil of such 
fraudulent Impostors to the Capacities of plain Country 
People. Upon hearing the Lamentation of divers 
Persons, not only that the small Pox was spread much 
about the Country, but also that many did die of it; 
did resolve to [/1./] conclude that book with these short but 
sure Directions for ordering people in that Disease. 
Being fully perswaded that I can hardly do my Country 
much better service, than to communicate my knowledge 
herein; having had large Experience, and wonderful 
happy Success, as well in curing without much 
difficulty or future [/2./] Marks, as preserving those conversant 
amongst the sick, from the [/3./] Infection; being 
things much desired by all people that do conceive 
[^p.2^] 
themselves in danger of this Noysom Disease, and 
well known for Truth to all such as have imployed 
me. 
 
Yea, whilst I lived in Aldingbourne, there was one 
Notable Example, viz. all died that had this Distemper 
not one escaping until three died out of one 
small [/4./] Family; and one out of a Neighbours 
[/5./] House, yet the former wanted not the Advice 
of the most famous Men in the Faculty of Medicine. 
The later did immediately (after the death of his servant) 
seek to me, and God so blessed my Endeavours 
that not one more died, yet one Child or [/6./] more had 
the Disease; but, if I forget not, they hardly kept 
their bed a day for it. 
 
One great Cause of this Disease being so Mortal in 
the Country, is because the Infection doth make many 
Physitians backward to visit such Patients, either for 
fear of taking the Disease themselves or transferring the 
infection to others. 
 
By this means the Tending Nurses do generally 
assume the sole Authority of Physitians, although 
that their Experience perhaps is no more, but what 
they did gather by their being once a sufferer under 
the like ignorant practicing Nurses. 
 
And in case the Master of the Family do give himself 
the Trouble and Charge of taking Advice and 
Remedies of some able Physitian, yet this signifies nothing; 
for their ignorant Confidence is such, that they 
will be [/7./] guided no farther by it than it agrees 
with their own shallow Brains, and Customary Practice. 
 
And considering how hard it is to break or alter an 
Old Custom that hath fully possessed the fond conceits 
of a multitude of ignorant people; I have 
[^p.3^] 
resolved not to strive against so turbulent a stream; 
but rather endeavour to make such (as are not 
too proud to learn) more able in their Callings, 
by communicating my Knowledge, grounded on 
Reason, and confirmed by many Experiments. 
 
And to begin I will teach an Antidote or preserving 
Medicine, which is this; 
 
Take flos sulphuris (i. e.) flowers of Brimstone 
(which is commonly sold by the Apothecaries) 
four ounces, of clarified Honey one pound; warm 
the Honey, and then stir in the powder, and so 
keep it in a Gally-pot for your use. 
 
And when you do conceive your self to be in 
danger of the small Pox, take the quantity of a 
Nutmeg or more, at Morning and Evening or 
oftener if you please. 
 
You may go about your business as at other 
times, not minding any order of Diet, for it is a 
very safe harmless Medicine and never the worse 
for being cheap. I have had very happy success 
in the using it, as there are several living can bear 
me [/8./] Witness; and some of them (I believe) 
will wonder to see me make it so common, but it 
is the Real Good of my Neighbour that I do aim 
at in publishing this Paper, and not Applause. 
 
Those people that are near a Chymist may do 
well to get such flowers as have been twice or 
thrice sublimed; and the last time from Colcothar; 
for an Ounce of such are worth 3 or 4 ounces of 
those that are commonly sold. 
 
[^p.4^] 
[/9./] 
But beware that you do not use powdered 
Brimston in the stead of flos sulphuris, least you 
should meet with a little Ratsbane amongst it. 
 
But to my business, when you find some of the 
symptomes to appear as the Head-ach, Drowziness, 
sometimes motions to vomit, pain in the 
back, these or some of these signs being accompanied 
with a feaver (at a season when the small 
Pox are rife) you may well Imagine that the Disease 
hath seized the Patient. 
 
When these signs do shew themselves (do not 
run madding to Dr. Dunce or his Assistance to be 
let bloud) but go to your Chamber (I do not say 
to your bed) and drink strong Beer, and now 
and then a Glass of Sack; and never fear increasing 
the Feaver by your so doing, for it strengthens 
Nature to cast out his Adversary that way 
which Nature doth most incline unto, as sometimes 
by Vomit, sometimes by Sweat and Urine. 
 
But I have alwayes given an Antimonial Vomit, 
as soon as I could possibly have a fit time to 
give it, (of which more hereafter) for it doth expel 
such a quantity of the Morbifick Matter, from 
all parts of the body, but especially from the [/10./] 
Head and [/11./] Stomach, that the disease afterwards 
seems to be quite Mastered; no light-headed 
discourse, no unruly actions, no excessive 
thirst appearing (or very little) afterward. And 
this have I done with very happy success very 
often; nay I have had some Patients have been 
angry that they should be confined to their Chamber 
[^p.5^] 
for a few Pimples (as they called them); and 
some never kept within doors. 
 
But such as cannot have well prepared Antimony, 
may give a drachm of Salt or Vitriol; and 
for want of that, give a drachm or a drachm and 
half, or two drams of purified white Vitriol, and 
those which cannot obtain that neither, were better 
to give the like quantity of crude white Vitriol 
than not to Vomit at all; for I have always 
observed that according as the stomach is more or 
less loaded with ill humors, so is this disease more 
or less violent; and not as some of our Country-people 
conjecture, as people that are fat and corpulent 
to be full of the small-pox; and that spare 
lean people should have but few. 
 
I shall in the next place give my Reader a 
Taste of some other Authors Opinion, how far 
they may be said to countenance this kind of 
Practice; and will herein be as brief as possible I 
can, as having treated more largely in the forementioned 
Book, under the Title of Feavers. 
 
Doctor Riverius in his Practice of Physick, page 
624, telleth us, That the Cure of Pestilential Fevers 
must be directed to three things, viz, The 
Fevers must be opposed with Coolers and Moisteners, 
the Putrefaction with [/12./] Evacuators 
and Alterers, the Malignant Quality with Antidotes. 
In the Chapter of putrid Feavers, pag. 576, 
he sayes, But if thirst be caused by a Cholerick Humor 
contained in the Stomach, the said Humor must 
be voided by Vomit or [/13./] Stool. 
 
[^p.6^] 
The Cholerick Humor here spoken of, being 
stirred, is generally the cause of Super natural 
Thirst, in all Fevers whatsoever. 
 
In the Chapter aforesaid pag. 570 he writes 
thus, Sometime also in the beginning of these 
Fevers, Vomit is to be procured, viz. when the 
Patient is much vexed with illness of Stomach, 
and with Vomiting, &c. And many times it falls 
out that great quantity of matter is contained in 
the Stomach and parts thereabouts, which must be 
evacuated as soon as possible may be by Vomit; 
(then he giveth a good Reason for so doing) seeing 
no Concoction can be expected of such Excrementitious 
matter in so great a [/14./] quantity; and 
whatsoever the Patient eats or drinks is changed 
into such like Humors and encreases the matter 
which is Cause of the Disease. Then by consequence 
to pour your cooling Julips, Apozemes, 
Pippin-Possets, &c. into such depraved Stomachs, 
is like to pouring Oyl on Fire (to quench it) instead 
of Water. 
 
Then he tells us, that Fernelius hath well observed, 
that all superfluity of Humors in the Stomach, 
Spleen, Pancreas, Mesentery, and the cavity 
of the Liver, is conveniently emptied out by 
a Vomit, which sometimes will not be removed by 
[/15./] Medicines that work downwards, though divers 
times Administred. Thus far Riverius. 
 
Now I must tell you that the Material cause of 
putrid Feavers, and the small-pox is the same; 
but that which doth put it into act, (or sets it 
[^p.7^] 
on working) is different: for the small-pox is set 
on Fire by the contagious [/16./] Air; as you may see 
that a common surfet (as you call it) when the 
small-pox is Epidemical it often turneth to be the 
small-pox, which had otherwise proved only a 
putrid Feaver. But of this I have given a larger 
account in another Treatise, which I hope shortly 
to publish. 
 
I will say no more of Vomits in this place, having 
in the aforesaid book shewed almost a Universal 
use of them, and proved it by undeniable 
Experiments. 
 
And considering the aversness of many people 
to this kind of Physick; partly out of a natural 
Antipathy, but more from observing the bad Events 
of ill prepared Medicines, too frequently 
made use of by such, whose Idleness and Ignorance 
keeps them from the knowledge of good 
Chymical Remedies; of which well prepared 
Vomits are (to my knowledge) of most admirable 
benefit to sick People. 
 
Well, if you will not be so suddenly rid of 
your Disease, as you might be by vomiting half a 
dozen times in two hours space; then I must give 
a touch again at the order of diet. And here I 
will tell you again, that if you keep your Patients 
from strong Beer to satisfie their Thirst, you do 
thereby exceedingly increase the Disease: And 
note likewise, that if you perswade them to eat 
either Flesh or Broth, you do almost as ill; But 
if you will be feeding them (though far better it 
[^p.8^] 
were let alone until they Hunger after it) then 
give them now and then three or four spoonfuls 
of a plain Sack-Posset, or a piece of White-bread 
Toast dipped in such strong Liquor as the Patient 
likes best, whether it be Sack, White-wine, Metheglin, 
Cyder, March or Mild Beer, or good 
Ale: and fear not to let him make his Toast swim 
in his Stomach if he do desire it. 
 
And for to make you the bolder I will give 
you Doctor Thompsons Opinion herein, in his 
Book of preserving the Bloud, pag. 164, says he, 
" Let none then Hæsitate to offer liberally what 
" is potulent or liquid to one that is Thirsty, for 
" 'tis both necessary and consentaneous to Nature 
" so to do: yea, through this omission the good 
" juice or solid parts may suffer a deperdition. 
 
And in the next page, having given divers Reasons 
for giving strong Beer in Fevers, he breaks 
out thus, "Away then with these Clogging, Dull, 
" Flat, Vapid, Debilitating Decoctions of the 
" Kitchin, with all their crude vegitable Ingredients, 
" most injurious to a febrile Stomach. 
 
Page 166 at Figure 3, he writes thus, "As 
" there are a company of Non-sensical Physitians, 
" who are loath to allow the dry soul of one 
" scorched in a Fever a sufficient quantity of moisture 
" to allay their Thirst: so are there Multitudes 
" of Learned Dogmatists (I am certain Egregiously 
" Ignorant in this particular) who though 
" they assent their Patients should have good 
" store of Liquor granted them, as properly answerable 
" to the indication of Siccity or drought, 
[^p.9^] 
" yet must it be so qualified, that it ought by 
" no means to contain too many hot particles, 
" least they should seem to act contrary to the 
" definition of a Feaver which is as they proclaim 
" it but falsly a preter-natural heat, wherefore 
" they strictly enjoyn Posset-drink made 
" with some poor starvling Liquor, Barley-water, 
" wherein cooling or very temperate Herbs are 
" boyled, small Beer, fair Water, Rose-water, 
" with some acid Juice mixed, &c. To this 
" they most devoutly keep a weak Wretch, not 
" doubting to mitigate (although they have failed 
" many Million of times) a Causos or any burning 
" Fit. 
 
And a little after he saith, "That they will 
" by no means approve of a Cup of Wine, or a 
" draught of strong Beer or Ale (because too hot 
" as 'tis fancied) the Principal Corroborating 
" [/17./] Diet, which I constantly prescribe to my 
" Patients. Thus far Dr. Thompson. 
 
To proceed, if you can get any of the oil of 
Sulphur by the Bell, and drop in 6, 8 or 10 
drops into a draught of strong Mild Beer now 
and then, it will wonderfully help a weak stomach 
to concoct the ill humors collected therein; 
which will much refresh the Patient. 
 
If they come forth ill or seem too flat (as 
you call it) then give now and then a Glass of 
Sack, with a dozen or twenty drops of Elixir 
Proprietatis therein; this chears the Vital Spirit 
[^p.10^] 
exceedingly, if the Elixir be good; which it is 
hard to obtain; for the more excellent a Remedy 
is; the more are they which do (through 
ignorance or Avarice) Adulterate the same. 
 
Therefore take this Course, first observe if it 
be thick as bloud, then it is Rich or strong of 
the Ingredients, and the fewer drops will serve 
for a Dose. Secondly, Smell to it, if it be strong 
of the Saffron, that is another Token of its 
Goodness. Thirdly, Taste a drop on your tongue, 
for although it be always bitter, yet the less bitter 
the more better; for that is a sign of being 
well digested. But if all these hold, and it hath 
a harsh Taste on the Tongue, it is not good; as 
being made with a Menstruum mixed with Oyl 
of Vitriol or Sulphur; which although I have 
directed to be given in the Patients Beer, yet in 
the Elixir it is not to be allowed; because it doth 
corrode the principal ingredients, viz. Myrrh, 
Aloes, and Saffron. 
 
Yet for all what I have said, you had better 
make use of either of them, then to have none; 
although I have seen some sold, that I would not 
give one ounce of my own preparing, for four 
of that; of the reason of which odds, I could 
easily make any ingenious man sensible, by comparing 
them together. 
 
In the next place, there is a Medicine sold in 
many places by the Name of Mathews's Pill, 
but in Truth Doctor George Starkey was the 
[^p.11^] 
first discoverer of that Excellent Remedy. But 
be the Author who it will, its Vertues doth sufficiently 
declare his worth; for I never saw any 
thing used by any Physitian that did ever come 
near it for giving Ease, and rest in any Feaver of 
what kind soever. 
 
But I might here make the same complaint as 
I did about preparing the Elixir, but I forbear. 
 
But I will teach you the right use thereof according 
to my many years Experience. 
 
If your Patient be suddenly taken so ill as to 
desire to go to Bed, you may presently give him 
two Pills as big as a Pease, and a draught of strong 
Beer with or after them, and if the party do 
neither Sleep nor Sweat in an Hour or two, repeat 
them again, and Beer as before; and repeat 
it again, and again too, if need be. But if sickness 
doth not compel them to their bed, defer the 
giving them Pills until bed-time; but do not 
miss giving two or three at going to bed during 
the whole time of Cure. 
 
But do not load them with Clothes (as the 
common Fashion is) but let them be covered, as 
may be well-pleasing to the Patient, and of the 
two it were better they are a little too cold, than 
to be ever so little too hot. 
 
Now because this may seem a Paradox to 
some people, being so diametrically opposite to 
common practice, I will give my Reason for so 
doing. 
 
[^p.12^] 
If they be too hot, the Vital Spirit flyeth 
from the Center to the Circumference, which 
should be imploy'd about the [/18./] stomach to 
concoct (or rather digest) the Morbifick matter 
therein contained; which is the Fewel that doth 
maintain the fire in this Disease. 
 
Do not all men see how slowly the stomachs 
of sound People do digest meat (I do not say 
drink) in hot Weather, for what it doth when 
the season is cold? And from this Conclusion 
you may draw a Reason for the giving strong 
Liquor to drink to febrile people, viz. that in 
regard the Appetite to eat [/19./] is taken away by 
the Disease, it is very absurd to deny the Patient 
such spirituous drinks as hath underwent a precedent 
[/20./] Fermentation (to ease the stomach of 
the burthen of digesting) so earnestly desired by 
Nature (that sure guide to true Medicine) that 
by the quick diffusing their vigorous Atoms in the 
bloud, the Archeus may thereby be speedily enabled 
to conflict with the Disease. 
 
Here perhaps some will say that I do write 
Tautologies; but I answer, so material a point, 
being so much opposed, and that by Persons 
esteemed eminently Learned, so much to the prejudice 
almost of all Mankind; cannot be repeated 
too often, until it hath obtained belief of 
the Audience. 
 
[^p.13^] 
But I have designed this Tractate, not to 
Teach the Learned, but to Instruct the poor 
ignorant Tenders of the sick, and such poor 
Wretches as are not able to hire a Tender, 
much less to pay a silken Doctor to feel their 
Pulse, whilest they look over the other shoulder, 
or hold some perfume to their Noses: I 
shall rather refer them to the Judicious Writings 
of Doctor Starkey, Doctor Thompson, Noah 
Biggs, and others; who partly from the works 
of that profound, indefatigable, Pyrotechnian 
Phylosopher Van Helmont; and partly from 
their own diligent study and labour at the Fire, 
(the Touchstone of Natural things) have not 
only battered some of Galen's [/21./] Out-works, 
but made the Foundation of his Phylosophy to 
Totter. 
 
It may here be expected, that I should teach some 
Excellent Oyntment to prevent the Pits, 
Marks and Scars, &c. which do commonly 
succeed this Disease; but I tell you that if the 
foregoing Instructions have been but indifferently 
followed, there will be no need of the latter. 
 
But for their sakes who (through some occasion 
or other) have neglected it, I will give a 
word or two of this also, for I have been forced 
to do somewhat in this kind of Practice; 
but I would not have my Reader imagine that I 
do pretend to an absolute deletion by this way; 
[^p.14^] 
but only a lessening of the same that they may 
not be so much deformed as otherwise. 
 
[/22./] 
So soon as the small-pox begin to suppurate, 
that is in plain English to ripen, then take oyntment 
of Tobacco being melted and with a Feather 
besmear the Patients Face as hot as they can 
endure it; and when they sit up it will be better 
to sit against a Chaffing-dish of Coles for an 
hour together; but those that cannot you may 
do well to cover their faces with soft paper moistened 
with the Oyntment. 
 
This is the best thing that I did ever see made 
use of; and yet I have spent much time amongst 
them, not only in bare visiting; but have watched 
several Nights with such as have seemed 
dangerous; whereby I had greater opportunity 
to observe the Operation of my Remedies: 
than those who only prescribe a Medicine by 
Aim, and sendeth their Bills to an Apothecary, 
who oftentimes makes up the quantity with rotten 
Stuff for want of good; and with chopping 
and changing for want of sorts. 
 
Now if any know better (as I doubt not but 
better is) I should be glad if either out of 
Christian Charity or Human Pity; he would 
communicate it to the World for the benefit of 
poor afflicted Mortals, whose Torment under 
this Disease cannot be demonstrated by any Pen; 
I mean when they have them much, and happen 
[^p.15^] 
to be handled according to the common way of 
Practice; for otherwise it seemeth but a light 
matter to undergo it. 
 
Lastly, I must advise you, not to rely too 
much on the use of the most Excellent Medicines 
that the Art of Man can prepare; for our merciful 
God that giveth us the Assistance of his 
Creatures, as well for Food as Medicine; can 
when he pleaseth hinder their effect if they 
are not received with Prayer and Thanksgiving. 
 
Therefore use the Means, but do not rely on 
it; but Pray to God with Sincerity and Faith, 
that he would direct to and bless the Means, 
and then you may with confidence and hope 
expect comfort thereby. To whose Great Name 
be Ascribed all Power and Glory for evermore, 
Amen. 
 
[^p.16^] 
[}Advertisement.}] 
 
THose that have occasion for any of those 
Medicines herein mentioned, may have them 
truly prepared by the Author at Reasonable Rates, 
if they are not living too remote from his House 
in Havant near Portsmouth; or at the George 
Inn in Chichester on Mundays, Wednesdays and 
Saturdays; or at the Half Moon in Peterfield on 
Saturdays only. 
 
Note, My Fever Pills which I have made use 
of many years, is not the same with Matthews's 
Pill, save in the original only; mine containing 
some eminent Cordial Ingredients which are not 
in that. Besides when I do intend it against the 
Stone I add a Mineral Salt, which renders it far 
more Efficacious in that Disease. 
 
Also I have an Electuary for such as cannot 
swallow a Pill, which answereth all the intentions 
of curing this Disease, except Vomiting. 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}AN 
APPENDIX.}] 
 
WHen I had finished this small Treatise and 
delivered it out of my Hand in order 
to be Printed; it came into my Mind 
that I had given directions to Vomit such Persons 
as should be infected with the Small Pox, as 
the most absolute speedy means to Extirpate 
that Disease, but had given no Instruction to 
the ignorant Tenders how to govern the Patient 
during the time that it is Working. Therefore 
I have supplied that defect by way of an 
Appendix, rather than to leave it defective in 
so Material a point. 
 
Therefore I will first shew (to such as have a 
little insight into Astrology) how to Elect a proper 
time for the Administration of the Medicine, 
[^p.18^] 
and then teach the Nurse how to do her 
Office. 
 
First observe what Sign the Moon is in; for 
that is the Basis of your Work. 
 
For of all the signs in the Zodiack, those that 
resemble such Beasts as do chaw the Cud, are by 
a general Consent of Physitians accounted the best. 
And I do know it to be so by my own Experience. 
 
Now which particular signs I do prefer before 
other, you shall know by my order in placing 
them; that which I place first, to be first made 
choice of. 
 
For I do esteem Capricorn [^Symbol of Capricorn omitted.^] before all the 
rest; the next, Taurus [^Symbol of Taurus omitted.^]; then Aries [^Symbol of Aries omitted.^]; 
after these, Cancer [^Symbol of Cancer omitted.^]; Pisces [^Symbol of Pisces omitted.^]; Scorpio [^Symbol of Scorpio omitted.^] and Sagittarius [^Symbol of Sagittarius omitted.^]. The Moon being in 
any of these seven will do indifferent well; but 
the other five I reject except on very urgent 
occasion: the worst of the five are Leo [^Symbol of Leo omitted.^] and 
Aquarius [^Symbol of Aquarius omitted.^]. I do hardly ever give a Vomit 
when the Moon is in either of them, nor often 
being in Libra [^Symbol of Libra omitted.^], Gemini [^Symbol of Gemini omitted.^] or Virgo [^Symbol of Virgo omitted.^], 
but the last is the best of the last five. 
 
Secondly, Observe with what Aspect, and from 
what Planet the Moon is beheld, for I had rather 
she be void of Course, than to be beheld by 
any Planet so that her next Application be good: 
[^p.19^] 
And I do prefer the ill Aspects of Jupiter [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] 
or Venus [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], rather than the good Aspects of 
Saturn [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] or Mars [^Symbol of Mars omitted^]. But the Moon being 
in Conjunction [^Symbol of conjunction omitted.^] Quartile [^Symbol of Quartile omitted^] or Opposition 
[^Symbol of Opposition omitted.^], with Saturn [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Sol [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] or Mars [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^], 
beware of giving any purging Medicine. And 
[^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] and [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] being so Aspected you ought to 
forbear likewise. 
 
Thirdly, Let one of those seven Signs ascend; 
and carefully avoid the presence of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] or Mars 
therein; neither let them nor the [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] behold the 
Degree ascending (partilly) by any bad Aspect, 
but [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] corporally in the Ascendant in any of 
those seven Signs is good. 
 
Much more might be said on this Subject, but 
I design Brevity, and this is the ground of all; 
and what I have written, I have proved by several 
Thousands of Experiments. Now such 
whose Understandings cannot comprehend this, 
let them observe when the Moon is in one of 
those seven Signs, viz, [^Symbols of Capricorn, Taurus, Aries, Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio and Sagittarius omitted.^], and 
avoid such days as she changes on, the full and 
either of her quarters. 
 
In the next place I must teach the Nurse how 
to govern the Physick in the time of its working. 
 
Therefore when you give any of the Vitriol 
Vomits, you need not be very curious, do but 
thus; give a good draught of strong Mild Beer 
[^p.20^] 
to the Patient, and in a quarter, or half an Hour 
after give the Physick, being dissolved in a little 
such Beer, and then some Sugar put into it; 
which for the most part doth quickly come up 
again loaded with ill Humors; then presently 
give the party another draught of the like Beer 
warm; do thus as often as the Patient doth 
Cast, which will be sometimes two, three, or four 
times. 
 
But if you take an Antimonial Vomit, then 
you had need to be more Circumspect. 
 
The best that I do know (that is to be had 
at the Shops) is that which is called Aqua Benedicta; 
being an infusion of Crocus Metallorum 
of which (if the Crocus be good) one ounce or 
an ounce and quarter is a sufficient Dose for a 
Man; but that which I have used many years is 
far more Gentle, and yet the Dose is much bigger, 
viz. 4, 5, or 6 ounces. But they are so 
safe that I commonly give them to big bellied 
[/23./] Women, to Ancient People, or to [/24./] Children 
of three quarters of a year old or under. 
 
Now these [/25./] Antimonial Vomits do (for the 
most part) keep the same order in working, as 
to the time, and you may take it any time of 
the day, either full or fasting, it matters not, if 
the Physick be but rightly prepared. 
 
When you have drank your Physick alone, 
then fast an Hour after it, walking a little if you 
[^p.21^] 
are able (for I have often given them to such 
[/26./] Patients as could hardly turn on their Beds 
without help) in which time it will work of it 
self (if it be strong enough) if not, take near a 
quarter so much as you took at the first and 
stir again. 
 
When the Patient hath Cast once, give him 
a large draught of warm Gray Posset-drink immediately 
after the Casting; doing so every time 
that he Casteth. 
 
And because I have seen some Country-People 
make their Posset-drink very ill, I will tell 
you how, and likewise how much I do usually 
make to be imploy'd in the working of one 
Purge. 
 
I take most commonly two Quarts of Milk, 
and when it is ready to boil I do pour thereinto 
a quart of strong Beer but not too stale 
(because that would make the posset have a 
sowre Taste) and so let it stand over the fire 
until it be clear. 
 
For the most part these Vomits are just two 
Hours in the working. And for my Emeto Cathar 
(or vomiting Purge) you may eat, drink, or 
sleep as soon as it is over, but commonly they do 
chuse to lie down on a Bed. 
[^p.22^] 
And that Night I do usually give the Patient 
three of my Fever Pills as big as a pease, and a 
draught of strong Liquor after them, having supped 
(either not at all, or) two hours before. 
 
And in regard many people loath Posset-drink 
(and not to drink good store of some Liquor 
were like a Laundress washing with Soap and 
none or little Water) I will tell you what will do 
as well, and that is strong mild Beer or Ale: But 
Broath is not good, and Gruel is much worse as 
I have seen proved. 
 
There is nothing (as I conceive) material now 
wanting, if you do but Accept it as kindly, as I have 
Candidly Communicated the same, not resting 
on Conjecture, (for there is no Argument beyond 
Experience) but making a practical Use of it. I 
doubt not but many Thousands will praise God 
for putting it into my heart to divulge it so plainly 
to the World. 
 
It may be some will say that there are abundance 
of abler Artists, who might probably have done 
it more Elegantly. I answer, Since they 
have not done it, there is great need that some 
body else should. For it is not he that can lend 
me a Hundred Pounds that is Thank-worthy; 
but he that lendeth me Four or Five Pounds to 
serve my Necessitous Occasion. And I studied 
not [/27./] Elegance (or Applause) but plainness; 
that it might be the more Universally Useful.
