Sectio .i. Cap. i.}] 
 
WHEN as in thys 
treatise I entend to 
declare thoccasion of 
Agues (almost no degrees 
excepted that 
in our time it hath not vexed) it 
behoueth fyrst to define what an 
ague is folowing Cicero, which 
[/1./] 
saith that euery thing which we 
purpose to speake of must rise of 
his definitio~. an ague is nothing 
[/2./] 
els but an vnnatural heate or caliditie, 
which taketh his beginninge 
at the harte, disperseth all 
[^f.C5v^] 
ouer the body by the artiers and 
veines, and so hurteth the actions 
therof. Thys laste parte of 
the definition is necessarily adioined 
to the same. For although 
a ma~ be made hotter the~ he was 
before (as it often chaunceth to 
dauncers, ru~ners, laborers and 
leapers. &c. yet it can not be said 
to haue an ague, vnles the caliditye 
or heat be so much encreased 
that it greatly hurte the bodye, 
and manifestly hurte the actions 
of the same. But althoughe the 
differences of feuers be diuers, 
yea and sundry, partly growing 
by thessence of the same, partlye 
by accide~ce as appereth by those 
[/3./] 
thinges whiche Galen writeth. 
Albeit that whiche procedeth of 
matter wherin calidity is kindled 
 
[^f.C6r^] 
[^A folded table omitted.^] 
 
[^f.C7r^] 
vnnatural, is of al other most 
in vse, where vppon as there be 
thre things as Hippocrates writeth, 
[/4./] 
wherof our bodyes be constituted 
or made, namely things 
conteining, thinges conteyned, 
and things making force, this is 
said of Solide partes, humors, 
and spirites: and the spirites naturall, 
vitall, and animal, are nothing 
els but an airye substance, 
subtil, stirring the powers of the 
bodie to performe their operations, 
the first takinge his beginning 
of the liuer, and by the veines 
whiche haue no pulse, spreadeth 
into y=e= whole body, thother 
procedeth from the hart, and by 
the artiers or pulses is sente into 
all the bodie, the last is ingendred 
in the braine, and is sent by 
[^f.C7v^] 
the sinewes (through the body, 
and maketh sence or felyng) so also 
there be thre kindes of simple 
[/5./] 
agues, for why, if an immoderate 
and vnnaturall heate be kindled 
in the spirits, this of the grekes 
[/6./] 
is called [^GREEK OMITTED^] of the Latines 
[/7./] 
Diaria, in English an ague of one 
daye, which may well be likened 
as sayeth Galen, Fuctius, & Bartholomeus, 
[/8./] 
to hot wind included 
within a bottell, for as it heteth 
vehemently the bottell wherein 
it is put: So the spirites chafed 
wyth an vnnvturall heate, more 
then nature can beare, inflameth 
al the body wherin they be conteyned, 
it is called Diaria, bicause 
it hathe but one accesse, and endeth 
by his owne nature in the 
space of one day, if it be duly handled. 
[^f.C8r^] 
[/9./] 
Benedictus Victorius sayth, 
and also Isaac that it is called Ephemera 
of Ephemeron, a certain 
fishe amongste the Grekes that 
liueth but one day, of the which 
also writeth Aristotle, and truly 
[/10./] 
by this reason it is called an exquisite, 
true and symple Diaria, 
which cometh when as w=t=out any 
rotte~nes, spirites waxing 
hot and burned aboue nature. 
[/11./] 
The which happeneth by many 
meanes, as of binding quality of 
the flesh, or thickenes which letteth 
y=e= accustomed effluxe of vapors 
and spirits, the powers sodainlye 
stopped, the whiche bycause 
it is hot and sharpe, therefore 
it causeth the feuer through 
lassitude and veheme~t werines, 
as also sheweth Siluius, and as 
[^f.C8v^] 
[/12./] 
I haue often marked to be true. 
Furthermore, watches, crudity, 
sadnes, feare, anger, greate cares 
of the minde, burning of the sun, 
cold, famine, dru~kennes, impostumatio~s, 
[/13./] 
of y=e= grekes termed [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
& of the Latines, of the Barbarians 
vndimia, or vs byles or 
pushes, of these and such lyke causes 
which may kindle the spirits 
is this Feuer enge~dred. The signes 
[/14./] 
by the whiche Diaries bee 
knowen are double, for certaine 
be co~mon to al Diaries, certaine 
perticuler: of common there be 
syxe in number, of the whyche 
the pulse is the first, for in al Diaries 
[/15./] 
as Galen sheweth: y=e= pulse 
is chaunged into greatnes, swiftnes, 
often as muche as in theym 
exquisitly do kepe that equality, 
[^f.C9r^] 
softnesse and order, which is according 
to nature, another common 
signe is vrine folowing altogether 
that whiche is according 
to nature, or doth littell varye 
from the natural state. Water 
or pisse accordinge to nature 
is of somewhat subred cholor, of 
a meane substance, in the which, 
that which is reside~t in the bottom 
of the vrinal is white, light 
and equall, as I haue often perused: 
thirdlye the qualitye of the 
color, which in all Diaria feuers 
is pleasant and gentell: fowrthly 
the maner of solution, for euerye 
one is dissolued into breathes, or 
goeth into fumes or copins, vapours, 
and gentel sweates: fiftly 
Symptomate or euyll accidence 
there is none, for neyther vehement 
[^f.C9v^] 
dolor of the head, ventricle 
or stomack, or other partes, lothsomnes 
of meates, vnquietnesse, 
thirst vnquenchable, or any such 
like: sixt bicause al Diaries come 
of extriusecall or outward cause, 
[/16./] 
whiche of the Greke Phisitions 
is called [^GREEK OMITTED^], of the 
Latines Primitiua, al the which 
Galen doth more at large demo~strate, 
or shew farther the signes 
by the whiche euerye Diaria is 
knowen perticularlye be these. 
They whiche haue the Feuer of 
watches, vitious humors accompanieth 
theym, swellynge of the 
[/17./] 
face, greif in mouing of the eyes, 
scarcely lifting vp the lids, much 
moysture of them, and smal pulses. 
For watches letting concoction 
as Hipp. saieth, and Regime~ 
[^f.D1r^] 
sanitat. salern. also, causeth rawe 
humors and vapors ingendring 
swolty heate, causing Feuers, as 
[/18./] 
sayth Auic. resoluing the bodye: 
wherevpon there foloweth euyl 
colour, swelling in the face, moisture 
of the browes, scarcelye lifting 
them, for through watches 
the braine and instrument of the 
senses, as full well sayeth Siluius 
[/19./] 
vpon Galen be continuallye exercised, 
wherevpon more faculty of 
the animall spirit is absumed or 
wasted, which at last is resolued 
& spent in doing actions. &c. whiche 
the Grekes call [^GREEK OMITTED^], the 
Latins Actio, we operations or 
[/20./] 
working, by the whych as testifieth 
Galen, is made the efficient 
mouing procedinge of facultyes, 
& facultas, of the Grekes is termed 
[^f.D1v^] 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], of vs powers. Whiche 
Galen witnesseth to bee nothinge 
els but the cause whereof 
action procedeth, we shall passe 
thys to learned Studientes of 
Philosophy and only Phisicke. 
For what nedes manye wordes, 
watches do let nature from the 
office of disgestinge, wherefore 
they leaue great rawnes, & lacke 
of naturall heat enseweth, of the 
which euil humors foloweth: again 
puffing of the face, moisture 
of the browes, and griefe of the 
mouing of them, when as the faculty 
is resolued, copy of vapors 
and humors troublinge. The ague 
of care, and sorowe, hathe 
leannes of the face, of sorow more 
bloe, of care more darke, bicause 
the spirits be returned in where 
[^f.D2r^] 
they be easely set on fier, and be 
discussed for the caliditye of the 
place, and the humor is dispersed 
into vapors, wherby the body in 
space of time is as well dried as 
made leane. In cares & thoughtes 
they be caried to the heade, 
in the which they be lesse wasted 
for the scarsitye of heate, then in 
the inward body, wherfore they 
do lesse drye, and than the habit 
or forme of the same hollownes 
with drinesse of the eyes, signifieth 
both to be affected, but in cares 
and cogitacions lesser, for the 
spirits and humors be lesser stirred, 
in sorowe greater. For the 
heate of the place resoluinge the 
spirites and humors, also a certaine 
want of comly colour foloweth, 
these effectes, that is the 
[^f.D2v^] 
skin destitute of his naturall colour 
and blye. They which haue 
the feuer of wrath and woodnes 
they haue neyther holownes of 
the eies, nor euil color of the face, 
but their eies seme more to stretche 
forth, as witnesseth Regimen 
[/21./] 
sanit. salern. the spirites dilated 
or spred, and for thys reason the 
face is not vncolored, but rather 
red, the spirits and humors thyther 
[/22./] 
flushinge, as sayeth Auicen 
when as the heate cometh thither 
from the profunditye of the 
body, it is not onlye raryed thyther. 
But also to the whole skin, 
wherevpon the greatnes of the 
pulse remaineth, eue~ so signes of 
y=e= other Diaries comming of the 
perturbation of the minde, must 
chiefely be rquired of the pulse, 
[^f.D3r^] 
for in sadnes the spirites be caried 
within, but not gentel, & there 
they be corrupted, as if they wer 
suffocated or choked, so that thei 
be not dispersed forth againe, as 
in wrath, but do accende or kindel, 
and consume the~ selues with 
in forth, wherefore in processe of 
time moisture is wasted, and vertue 
or strength ouerwhelmed, & 
for that cause the pulse is littell, 
feble and rare, bicause it is neyther 
of necessity nor of strong facultye, 
In sodeine feare the blud 
and spirites be quickelye moued 
wythin, as it were to his spryng 
and origin returned, and y=e= mind 
also is troubled, for nature being 
moued, seketh prouide~tly to saue 
herself, the spirits driuen hyther 
and thither (as by them as well 
[^f.D3v^] 
as I that hath bene in great sodaine 
daunger, is well knowen) 
and so the spirites are kindeled, 
wherevpon swift pulse is made, 
necessity prouokinge, the minde 
also stirred maketh the~ vnequal 
and running to their brannches, 
in long olde sorowes of feare, the 
spirits also be dispersed and vertue 
waxinge feble, the pulses be 
such as we haue said to be in sadnes. 
Suche as haue the feuer of 
heat or blitning of the sun sayeth 
[/23./] 
Galen, theyr skin is drye and hot 
as that whiche is perched with 
the sun, of the whych in this orizon 
& countrye of oures we haue 
no great nede to entreate of, leauing 
it to the Phisitions & inhabitantes 
that dwell nerer to the 
meridionall line, and hoter Regions 
[^f.D4r^] 
as Hispaine and Affricke. 
They whiche haue the Ague of 
cold, thei be vexed with greuous 
distillations, for the colde doeth 
bind the sonnes excreme~ts with 
in the skin, their flesh also is lesse 
hot, and the whole body pretendeth 
greater humor, bicause the 
accustomed effluxe is letted thorow 
cold, further ther is no shrinking 
or wrinkling in the skyn of 
the face. They whiche haue the 
Feuer through lassitude or wearines, 
their skin is more drier the~ 
in other Diaries, bicause exercise 
do drie the body; and exhausteth 
or draweth the humidytye or 
moisture of it, their pulses also 
be vnlyke, for being weried thorow 
exercyse aboue measure, sheweth 
lyttel force of vertue by reason 
[^f.D4v^] 
of the imbecility or weaknes 
thereof. They whiche haue had 
but small labour, theyr strength 
not being diminished, haue greater 
pulse. They which be corrupted 
or vexed with Diaria of fear 
and famine, there is no great tokens 
required to the knowledge 
of them. For the causes maye be 
easely knowen by the talk of the 
sick and their associats or familiars. 
They which haue the Ague 
of Vndimia which is an impostemation 
of windy fleume and vaporous, 
those haue great pulses, 
bicause necessity pricketh, that is 
feuerous heat, and faculty obeyeth 
necessity (as the prouerb saieth) 
nede hath no law, wherfore 
they be swyft and often, yet haue 
thei equality of pulse, bicause the 
[^f.D5r^] 
instrumentes be not let neyther 
by obstruction nor abundance of 
humors or sharp vapors, neither 
by co~pesse except there be greate 
infla~mation, which then is the 
cause of muche heat, and foorthwith 
of force a certayne humor 
is caried hot from within, forthe 
to the skin, but yet pleasant, for 
it cometh of a gentell matter, for 
such agues haue no sharp biting 
quality, whe~ only heat perhaps 
of a bile or pushe, and not of rotten 
fume going or cominge from 
the hart, their face is altogether 
red and puffed vp for the abundance 
of heat, and the vrine appeareth 
somewhat whyte, bycause 
y=e= matter cholericke which 
ought to make the water more 
[^f.D5v^] 
coloured is translated to the impostume, 
and bycause the easines 
of heate maketh not warme the 
blud aboue masure, therefore it 
procreateth not muche choler, 
whych geueth hygh color to the 
water (of the whiche colours in 
my methode to the sycke manne 
may be and is shewed at large.) 
And thus I thinke doeth suffice 
of this one daye Ague (and yet 
not vngratefull to the readers) 
in the which vsinge them selues 
well, of more griefe or molestacio~ 
are not like to be troubled wyth. 
But if thei neglect the wel vsing 
of themselues in these & the Phisitions 
counsel, it maye chaunge 
perhaps to a putrid, or Etike as 
[/24./] 
not onlye I haue sene and noted, 
but as Isaac and Constantine wel 
proueth. 
 
[^f.D6r^] 
[}Of the Diaria feuer, or one daye Ague 
of many dayes Cap. 2.}] 
 
THere is another Ague 
of this kind whiche 
is called of the 
Latin writers Diaria 
plurimum dierum 
that is an Ague of manye dayes 
bycause it contineweth vnto the 
third day, and somtimes longer, 
[/25./] 
as witnesseth Galen, yea oftentymes 
it lasteth to y=e= fowrth day 
fyft and seuenth, and thus is it 
the~ whych the Latines termeth 
Synochus no~ putrida. for let none 
maruel that Galen and other old 
writers do cal this ague a Diaria 
feuer when as it is of y=e= substa~ce 
of a Diaria feuer for that it lasteth 
more then one daye, for although 
[^f.D6v^] 
the name be repugna~t 
vnto it, yet bicause it hathe one 
nature wyth others, continuing 
his fit or peroxisme from the beginning 
to thend, co~tinually for 
the space of certain dayes, wherfore 
it is most aptly called a Diaria, 
especiallye wantinge a more 
proper or conuenyent name to 
terme it by. Thys feuer cometh 
for the thickenes and binding of 
the meats or ways of the pores 
[/26./] 
in the body & flesh, and as Fuctius 
vpon Galen sayeth eyther the 
small meates obstructed or wynking, 
or also the body moderately 
thycked and bounde, the which 
happeneth of cold, of the temperament 
eyther of bathes or of 
medicine to sharpe and feruent, 
the whych often chaunseth thorow 
[^f.D7r^] 
the ignorance of who~ made 
Phisitions, and of more weake 
then wyse practysioners, more 
lewd, then learned. Hereto ioyne 
the receyuers of folysh hardines, 
sauers of syluer, not sekers of security, 
hauing nome~ not serching 
for Re~, and so by thys meanes y=e= 
feuer of one or few daies is chau~ged 
to an Ague of many dayes, 
and from curable, often to vncurable. 
But such as of helth hath 
regarde, foreseeth as Galen saith 
[/27./] 
not only these things, but eschueth 
suche others whych maye in 
any case molest the body and dry 
the skyn. For the thycknes therof 
detayneth many fumous and 
slimye excrementes, wythin the 
body, besydes also that floweth 
out of them, is very small, so that 
[^f.D7v^] 
by this means this feuer is kindled. 
Fyrste thys feuer is knowen 
by touchynge, by reason the skin 
is more hard and compacte, it is 
also knowen by motion of heate, 
as wythin the fyrst course is gentel 
and pleasa~t, after if thou hold 
thy hand lo~ger, it is sharper, for 
littell breath cometh forth of the 
smal meats or wais of y=e= obstructed 
skyn, whych carieth the heat 
outward, and therefore it is perteyned 
to be meke: But in space 
of time it maketh the hand warmer 
and warmer, so that by litle 
and litle the encrease appeareth 
sharper. Thyrdly it is vnderstanded 
of the vrine, neyther consistence, 
substaunce, nor color is 
much aliened or chaunged from 
nature, the bloud is not very feruent, 
[^f.D8r^] 
nor there is not very much 
choler, whych maketh the vrine 
coloured (but herewyth always 
the complection, dyet, age, and 
tyme muste chieflye be foreseene) 
Fowrthly of the forme and facio~ 
of the body, whyche continueth 
and falleth not lyghtlye awaye, 
bicause the thickenes of the skin 
letteth the resolution of vapors 
and humors. Therfore the eyes 
be neyther hollowe nor drye, but 
more permane~t or stedfast, a litle 
moister then for the natural constitucion. 
Fiftly of the pulse, whiche 
is equal, greate, swyft, often 
and vehemently mouyng continuallye. 
And thus I suppose to 
haue said sufficiently concerning 
the fyrst kynde of symple Agues 
of the inflamation of the spirits, 
[^f.D8v^] 
whereby of eche sensible person 
they may easely be vndersta~ded. 
Nowe it foloweth in the nexte 
section, of those feuers which co~meth 
of putrifaction of humors, 
wyth lyke compendiounesse to 
expresse. 
 
[}Of the rotten feuers throughe the 
putrifaction of humors. 
Sectio. 2. Cap. 3.}] 
 
THother kindes of putrifiynge 
feuers, is 
whe~ an immoderate 
caliditye or heate is 
kindled in the putrifying 
humors, and trulye in the 
bodye of man be fower principal 
humors, whyche continuyng in 
the proportion that nature hath 
lymited, the bodye is free from 
[^f.E1r^] 
these feuers. The principall humor 
is blud, the~ flegme, after choler, 
last melancholie. The distemperance 
of blud hapneth by one 
of thother humors, through the 
inordinate or superfluous mixture 
of them, and not of him self, 
for blud is temperate of his proper 
quality as saith Hippocrates 
[/28./] 
hauing no contrariety exceding 
either in heate or cold, or in cold 
or heate, or in moist or drith, or in 
drith or moisture, as confyrmeth 
Galen in his own language, this 
[/29./] 
left writen [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
The which 
in our tung may be vndersta~ded 
this, that by aucthoritye and 
good reason bloud to be neyther 
[^f.E1v^] 
hotte nor moyste, but temperate. 
Yet here I must saye agreing to 
[/30./] 
Galen, although blud be neither 
hot, cold, moist or dry, yet y=e= blud 
of y=e= veines to be lesse luke warm 
then the blud of the artiers, and 
therfore it is likened to the temperament 
of the spring which is 
neither so hot as sommer, nor so 
cold as winter, in my Methode 
[/31./] 
to the Phisition I haue shewed 
this more large, so that I wyshe 
the Englyshe readers to resorte 
thither for my opinion farther. 
Fleume is of two sortes, natural 
and vnnaturall, cold and moiste, 
whyte and swete: without taste 
is y=e= natural, vnnatural is mixed 
with other humors, and there be 
eight, watrye, slimye, glassy, plastry, 
salt, sowre, harshe & stiptike: 
[^f.E2r^] 
Choler be of two sortes, natural 
and vnnaturall. Natural choler 
is y=e= some of the blud, vnnatural 
is mixed with other humors as 
Citrine, yelky, grene, and glassy, 
Melancoly natural is the dregs 
of the blud: vnnatural procedeth 
by adustion of cholerick mixture, 
and of the distemperance of these 
humors aforesaid the agues folowynge 
are ingendred. But humors 
are said to putrifye either 
within or without the vesselles, 
and within the vessels they putrify 
two waies, namely altogether 
at ones, or one alone, if all 
humors putrifye in all vessels equally: 
but especially in the greatest, 
then is it called in Greke [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
in Latin synochus, in Englyshe 
a hot rotten Ague. For the 
[^f.E2v^] 
Grekes call euery feuer [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
whych hauing one paroxisme or 
fit continueth the same the space 
of certaine dayes, or that whych 
lacketh any great mutacion vntil 
it come to his state or heyght 
This the Latines very properly 
and aptly continens continua termeth 
it (that is alwaye alyke) of 
this there be two kinds. Thone 
hath no note at al of putrifactio~ 
and that as afore is sayd is to be 
numbred one of Diaria feuers, 
thother hath a manifest sygne of 
putrifaction. The firste of these 
with the Latynes is named Synochus 
siue co~tinens non putrida 
The second is termed co~trarily, 
Synochus siue continens putrida 
[/32./] 
Those phisitions sayeth Fuctius 
are not therefore to be folowed, 
[^f.E3r^] 
which cal thone in the masculine 
gender Synochus, and thother in 
y=e= feminyne ge~der Synocha whe~ 
as the Grekes do call thone and 
thother Synochon, as in the next 
chapter folowyng more largelye 
shal appeare y=e= diuersities of the~. 
 
[}Of the diuersity of rotten feuers. 
Cap. 4.}] 
 
BUt now of these feuers 
which be called 
Synochi there be .iii 
differences, for some 
of them do equallye 
in greatnes and vehemencye endure 
from the begynninge vnto 
y=e= end, as not only sayth Fuctius, 
[/33./] 
but as I haue alwayes marked, 
which of the Grekes therfore be 
termed [^GREEK OMITTED^] y=t= 
[^f.E3v^] 
is to saye, alway remaininge in 
one vigor and force, other some 
from the begynnyng do always 
encrease, and therfore they be called 
in Greke [^GREEK OMITTED^] & [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
that is, alway augmenting 
of the contrarye part, other 
some do by littel and littel diminish 
and decrease, suche be called 
[/34./] 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] as Galen teacheth 
at large, Moreouer and besydes 
if some one humor alone doe putrifye 
within the vessels, that feuer 
is then caused, which is called 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] in Greke, in Latin 
continua, of vs continual, and it 
is so called bicause vntil rest (and 
clere deliuery of the feuer) it ceaseth 
not, yet doeth he remit and 
slake euerye fit, so that now here 
[^f.E4r^] 
vpon it may verye well appeare, 
what differe~ce there is betwene 
Synochus and Synoches. For in 
Synochus there is no remission 
of heate: but in Synoches ther is 
sensible remission in euery fytte. 
Furthermore Sinochus hath one 
onelye fyt enduringe to the ende. 
Synoches hath contrariwise manye: 
but as they differ by the aforesaid 
reasons, so certaine they 
agree in this thing, that neither 
of them reacheth to the state (by 
any experience that euer I had) 
and truelye by the opinion of all 
learned Phisitions, there is no 
sickenes cured that passeth not 
these fower times, beginninge, 
augme~ting, state, and declining, 
and thus Galen doth more copiously 
[/35./] 
demonstrate. But the Neotericall 
[^f.E4v^] 
phisitions of the Grekes 
who folowed after Hipp. time, 
[/36./] 
sayeth Fuctius, made some difference 
betwixt these two feuers, 
rather committinge a solycisme, 
then to leaue the forme of them 
vntouched, for the Grekes call 
thone and thother [^GREEK OMITTED^], and 
neither of them [^GREEK OMITTED^]. Therfore 
Galen writeth in the end of 
his co~me~taries, which he made 
[/37./] 
vpon the seconde booke of Hipp. 
that Hippocrates nor anye other 
of the Grekes haue called that 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], which we haue termed 
continent. Thys worde therfore 
hath bene inuented by phisitio~s 
of oure dayes, when as the olde 
writers haue comprehended by 
this name [^GREEK OMITTED^] bothe kindes 
of agues, both that which vntyl 
[^f.E5r^] 
the state hath no mutacions, and 
also is conteyned with many perticuler 
[/38./] 
ambagis, and hath some 
remissio~as Galen sheweth more 
largelye, returning to shewe the 
causes and sygnes in thys chapter 
folowing of Synochus siue co~tinens 
putrida, and so of the rest 
in order. 
 
[}Of the continual rotten feuer. cap. 5.}] 
 
[/39./] 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] after the Grekes, 
of the Latines termed Synochus 
siue continens putrida, 
in English a continual rotten 
[/40./] 
Ague, which as Galen sayth 
continueth without anye mutacion 
or verye littell, and for that 
reason as is sayd in the Chapter 
[/41./] 
afore it is called continens which 
[^f.E5v^] 
happeneth where all the vessels, 
but most chieflye in the greatest, 
which are anexed aboute y=e= flaps 
of the lunges and spiritual members, 
al equally putrifiing, which 
[/42./] 
often happeneth as Fuctius writeth 
of vehemente bindinge and 
retaining the filth in the cauitye 
or hollownesse of the vessels, enducinge 
a burninge heate. For 
what thinges so euer be hot and 
moyst and haue a difficell transpiration, 
these quicklye putrifye, 
wherefore thys kynde of Feuer 
chaunceth not to leane persons, 
nor to such as be of a thin constitution, 
cold temperament, nor in 
old age (that euer I saw) but often 
in them which abound with 
blud, and of sanguine complection, 
replenished wich humors, fat 
[^f.E6r^] 
and corpulent, solemners of Bacchus 
feastes, gorge vppon gorge, 
quaf vppon quaf, not altogether 
wyth meat or drynke of good norishmente, 
but of (o~ne gatheru~) 
aswel to the destruction of them 
selues, as vncurable to the Phisitions, 
as by my predictio~ came 
to passe (besydes others) vpon a 
Gentilma~ in Suffolk a little fro~ 
Ipswych, who by y=e= causes afore 
said got his siknes, & therof died 
y=e= .ix. day, according to my predictio~, 
as his wife & fre~d knoweth. 
The sygnes whych argueth best 
this ague, their pulses are great 
vehement, swyft & ofte~, yet equal 
vntyl the strength of the natural 
powers be demynished, the whiche 
to all men happeneth, that 
is in the daunger of death: the 
[^f.E6v^] 
spiritual blud fayleth in the artiers, 
or pulses theyr force, dryinge 
heat, at the last consuming all, 
and the vryne is lyttel, thin, clere 
and not chaungyng, glowyng of 
colour. 
 
[}Of the kindes of symple Agues. Cap. 6.}] 
 
THere be thre kinde of 
simple agues, which 
priuatly of y=e= Grekes 
is termed [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
of vs continuall. For 
when red choler doeth putrifye 
wythin the vessels, then is it 
called a continual Tertian in greke 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] in Englyshe a burninge 
Ague. And when fleume doth putrify 
within the vessels, it is named 
a continuall quoatidian. If 
[^f.E7r^] 
black color do suffer putrifaction 
in the vessels, then is it a continuall 
quartayne. Therfore the continual 
feuers be of one kind with 
the interpolates, as I shall here 
after declare. For the Tertian co~tinual 
agreeth wyth y=e= exquisite 
tertia~ interpolate for thone & thother 
hath his peroxisme or fit 
euery thyrd day. the co~tinual quotidiall 
accordeth wyth the quotidiall 
interpolate, bicause euery 
day they haue theyr course: Neuertheles 
the continuall and interpolate 
do differ one wyth anther. 
Notwythstandynge they 
grow of one humor, yea and that 
two maner wayes. Fyrst in the 
continuall agues, the putrifying 
humor is contayned within the 
vessels, contrariwise in the intermittes 
[^f.E7v^] 
or interpolates. The humor 
conteyned without the vessels, 
is dispersed ouer all the sensible 
partes of the body. Secondarely 
the interpolate doe cease 
at the state of the feuers, as I 
haue alwayes marked, Fuctius 
[/43./] 
therto agreinge, bicause by a certayne 
force they are purged by 
themselues, therefore termed of 
the Grekes [^GREEK OMITTED^] that is leauing 
of. The co~tinual do not so, 
for the continuall doe not remit, 
vntill the feuer be vtterly dissolued. 
Therfore the certaine token 
of the feuer continuall, is that it 
leaue not of vntyll it leaue altogether. 
Other sygnes be commo~ 
with the intermitting, for exquisyte 
burninge feuer kepeth all other 
notes of the exquisite tertia~ 
[^f.E8r^] 
intermittinge, varying onelye in 
this dyfference, bicause it inuadeth 
not wyth force, nor leaueth 
not into quietnesse. By the same 
reason it whyche hath accession 
or recurse euery day, or is exacerbated, 
pretendeth all the notes 
of the exquisit quotidian, but bicause 
it doth not intermit, it differeth 
from the quotidian intermittinge: 
lykewyse that whyche 
hath accession euery fowrth day 
kepeth the notes of the quartain 
exquisite, but cometh not to rest. 
 
[}Of the burnyng Ague. cap. 7.}] 
 
[/44./] 
THe feuer which the 
Grekes terme [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
the Latines Ardens febris, of vs 
a burning feuer, as 
[^f.E8v^] 
is shewed partlye afore, whyche 
chaunceth whe~ as yelow choler 
is putrifyed in the veynes continually 
[/45./] 
burning,and yet chieflye, 
is of the same kind wyth the exquisite 
tertian intermitting, bycause 
it cometh of y=e= same humor: 
Neuertheles it differeth fro~ the 
same humor, bicause in this yelow 
cholor is conueyed through 
the whole body. In burnyng feuers 
also the humor is co~tained 
in y=e= vessels together wyth blud, 
and herevpon it commeth that 
burnyng Agues at euery fyt doe 
not cease as the interpolates do, 
when as in these choler is vehemently 
styrred, and by nature co~pelled 
foorth stronglye, and then 
the Rigor was wont to folowe, 
& the feuer lowsed, which Hipp. 
[^f.F1r^] 
hath sygnyfyed in these wordes, 
he who is vexed wyth burninge 
agues, if the Rigor shal folow is 
delyuered from the syckenesse: 
Rigor est vniuersi corporis inequalis 
co~cussio quassatio vs, that 
is: Rigor is a vehement and an 
vnegall motion together of the 
hole body. And a burning Ague 
is knowen by these xii. signes, 
[/46./] 
where in my opinion Benedictus 
Victorius sayeth full expertly as 
[/47./] 
foloweth, Fyrst the heade aketh, 
for the abundance of matter burning 
in the cauities of the whole 
body, the vapors therfore ascending 
vppe to the pelicelles of the 
brayne, alterynge the temperament 
therof, by reason wherof y=e= 
payne or grief is caused: Another 
sygne is the head wyth the rest 
[^f.F1v^] 
of the body burneth, through the 
inflammation of fierye heat, by 
whose lyghtnes the essence goth 
to the head: Thyrdlye the Ague 
inwardlye encreaseth ouer al into 
flames, wherfore the burning 
is felt at the harte, for as sayeth 
Galen it is the most hottest and 
[/48./] 
driest humor of al otheres, as wel 
proueth these words [^GREEK OMITTED^]: 
Fowrthly the heate penetrateth 
inward wyth a sharp biting 
qualitye: Fyftlye, continuall 
watches, when as from the inward 
members vapors is carried 
to the brayne, makyng it hot and 
drye cleane contrarye to his nature, 
consumynge the moysture, 
whyche is the cause of the slepe, 
[^f.F2r^] 
& maketh dryth the verye cause 
of watches: Syxtlye trouble of 
the whole body wyth much vnquietnes, 
by reason of the swyft 
mouing of the matter from one 
parte to another is made: Seuenthlye 
thyrste intollerable and 
vehement, wha~ as it is wrought 
through the sharpnes of putred 
matters hot an drye as well in 
the highest parts as in y=e= mouth 
of the stomack, wesand, tung and 
pallate, wyth the rest of the Organes: 
Eyghtly a drie & hot tu~g, 
and as Fuctius sheweth, sharpe, 
thycke, and blacke, yea, and as I 
haue often marked, wyth filthye 
blacke teeth and gummes perched: 
Nynth swift pulse & breath 
in the same maner: Tenth vrine 
fier red, and as it were towards 
[^f.F2v^] 
grene, and the more red co~mixed 
wyth grene, the more heate and 
gryefe it agueth: yet you shall 
not maruell if it bee not so the 
fyrst & second daye: for as yet possible 
the blud is not altogether 
comixed with the adustion of the 
cholericke qualitye of the Ague. 
Eleuenth consyder the burnyng 
doth not cease, but remayneth 
still in hys force, to the state of 
the Ague. Twelfth lacke of slepe 
and quietnes, causeth the sycke 
to shewe a francye countenance, 
speakyng, groning grieuously in 
hys slumber. The which kind of 
slepe is no more grieuous sygne 
then it is vnprofytable for the 
sycke, and note (further by my aduise) 
if thys happen in the so~mer 
tyme, and in choleryck complection, 
[^f.F3r^] 
and where, the vse of hot 
wynes, and extreme labor hathe 
bene vsed before the syckenesse: 
feare not to iudge of it then a 
burning Ague. 
 
[}Of the pestilentiall feuer, or plage, 
or boche. Cap. 8.}] 
 
THere is also of the 
kinde of putrifying 
feuers, a feuer pestilential, of the Grekes 
called [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
[/49./] 
of y=e= Latines pestilens febris 
of vs properlye the pestilence, so 
[/50./] 
called, bicause it spryngeth and 
groweth by inspiration and venemous 
[/51./] 
ayre, for as Galen testifieth, 
the ayre being corrupt, maketh 
the humor of the bodye to 
corrupt and putrify also. But the 
[^f.F3v^] 
pestilente feuer groweth not of 
symple putrifaction, but also it 
happeneth and procedeth by another 
[/52./] 
cause, which corrupteth y=e= 
hole substance of the body, or as 
Galen is wont to terme it, y=e= proprietye 
of the temperament, and 
of the whole substaunce, whyche 
[/53./] 
thing truly Galen doth wel confyrme 
(as auoucheth Fuctius) after 
this sort, saying that the curation 
of common dyseases be vnperfect, 
when as they growe of 
and by the ayre compassyinge vs 
aboute, for often tymes, the exhalations 
drawen vp from marihses, 
pondes, standinge pooles, 
and such lyke, eyther exhalalatio~s, 
be y=e= causes of such diseases. And 
it happeneth sometime that the 
seasons of the times of the yeare 
[^f.F4r^] 
be causes therof, wherevpon he 
sayeth very wel: that the curation 
in exhalatio~s, hurting rather 
y=e= body by propriety of substance, 
then by quality, tendeth to two 
scopes, namely to alter & chau~ge 
the place, and procure expiratio~. 
But in these whych are hurt by 
qualitye, the curation of the diseases 
be not only wrought by co~trary 
qualities, but also they consyste 
of prouision altogether. By 
these wordes truly it may plainly 
appeare, that Galen confesseth 
the pestile~t exhalations, causing 
pestiferous feuers, doe hurt oure 
bodyes rather through the propriety 
of the whole substance the~ 
in quality or diste~perature: whervpon 
pestilent feuers do procede, 
especiallye of and by the meanes 
[^f.F4v^] 
of the aire, and although they do 
contaminate and infect by touching, 
by the companye of men & 
society of life, yet their origin and 
most puissant force, consysteth in 
the ayre, which we breth and fro~ 
thence they procede, and certes 
the poison of the ayre perring vs 
is of all other moste prestent and 
effectuall, nedinge no humor or 
grosse matter to conuey him vnto 
vs when as he is of himselfe 
most slender, he quicklye passeth 
by the Lungs through [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
termed of the Grekes, 
of vs the wynde pype, vnto the 
hart, the most worthye member 
of life, and so into the artiers, crepyng 
ouer all the body, al which 
[/54./] 
accordinge to Fuctius meanynge 
we haue more largely expressed, 
[^f.F5r^] 
that they whiche nowe a dayes 
wyth greate pryde accompteth 
the pestilent feuers amongst the 
diseases of the substance, myght 
plainly vnderstand that he hath 
[/55./] 
written no new thing, as Cardanus 
very learnedly and effectually 
proueth. Moreouer in diuers 
aucthors there is mencion made 
of sundrye names for the plage, 
[/56./] 
Iohannes Fernelius and also Benedictus 
Victorious vseth three, 
Pestilentia, Epidemia & Vndemia. 
Pestilentia, or the pestilence is a 
corruption of the ayre throughe 
the naughty and hid quality, by 
the whych dyuers griefes hapen 
to diuers, and to sundry vndeuided, 
albeit it is of diuers kindes, 
therfore it is found aswel in mankind, 
as in the kindes of brutish 
[^f.F5v^] 
beastes. Epidemia is the corruption 
of the aire, troughe the euil 
and hid quality, by the which 
many griefes chaunce, in the vndeuided, 
of one kind only, so that 
Epidemia shall be in mankinde 
only vndeuided, or in some other 
one only kind of y=e= brutish vndeuided 
(& this of Galen is termed 
Morbus vulgaris, quoniam ex co~tagio 
per vulgum vagatur.) Undemia, 
is corruption of the water 
and of the earth, through the 
euil and hid qualitye thereto adioined, 
and note that althoughe 
these proper names bee diuers, 
yet they be vsed of Gale~ & Auicen 
as Sinonomies, so that I passe 
theym ouer to suche as are satisfied 
with no mans iudgeme~t, but 
what they reade themselues, to 
[^f.F6r^] 
peruse in the places afore auouched, 
where they may find to content 
the~ more largely, then here 
[/57./] 
is requisyte. George Agricola 
writeth, that the Grekes do vse 
to cal euery kind of plage [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
whiche I thinke of vs is termed 
Murren. Further he affirmeth 
that the parts of the world hath 
varied in forme and kindes of the 
plage: for the Egyptians were 
plaged with the Lepry, the Atticis 
with the ioint ache, the Romaines 
with the Semitertian, 
or that Ague compound of Tertian 
and Quotidian, the Arabians, 
with swellinges in y=e= throte 
and flanke, the Neapolitanes, or 
rather the besegers of Naples, 
with the pockes (spred sence to 
far abrode, through al the parts 
[^f.F6v^] 
of Europe, no kyngdome that I 
haue bene in free, the more pity) 
and sethence, sundrye otherwise 
plaged with manye other infectiue 
diseases: as we, not out of 
minde past, with a sweate called 
stoupegalante, as that worthye 
Doctor Caius hathe written at 
large in hys booke de Ephimera 
Britanica, and sethence with many 
pestilential agues, and lastlye 
of all, with the pestilente boche 
[/58./] 
rightlye termed. Ingendred as 
you haue hearde, and as Fuctius 
sayth further, chiefly two ways, 
of a vitiate and rotten aire, and 
also throughe abundance of euill 
humors, termed of the Greekes 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] and [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is of 
fulnes and muchenes in quantity, 
or of euill ioyce, termed of the 
[^f.F7r^] 
Grekes [^GREEK OMITTED^], gathered 
throughe euil diet, whiche most 
chiefly happeneth to me~ of war, 
and mariners, whose meate god 
knoweth, I haue often sene of il 
norishmente, and worse ordered 
(the more is y=e= pity, that so worthy 
seruitours shoulde not beneficiallye 
be at all times prouided 
for) with as vnconstant trauell 
and all euill aire besides: and so 
redely brought to putrefaction. 
[/59./] 
The worst aire as Agricola testifyeth, 
is agreinge to that you 
haue hard, ioyned with South 
and South west windes, filling 
the body with repleting humors 
with hot and moist seasons, such 
as bee of the same complection, 
[/60/] 
sayth Cardanus, to whom Fernelius 
consenteth, that be hot and 
[^f.F7v^] 
[/61./] 
moist of temperament, and I say 
women with childe also be more 
apt to receiue the plage, the~ they 
that be of cold nature, by reason 
the artiers be more large in the~, 
than in the cold complection, the 
which dailye to the eye is made 
manifest. So that any great aucthoritye 
to proue this shall not 
nede. The Astrologians addeth 
[/62./] 
to the procreation of these plages 
recited, the influence of certain 
starres endusing the plage, 
yea and the times therof shorter 
or longer to reigne, againste the 
whych with Agricola, I saye it 
pleaseth vs not to inuay, y=e= Deuines 
sayeth, the punishment of 
God for oure offences: As for example, 
was not the holye kinge 
and prophet Dauid by reason he 
[^f.F8r^] 
misused Urias wyse, and procured 
his death, therefore plaged. 
And did not Ezechiel by the commaundement 
of God, shewe the 
Citizens of Hierusalem that the 
third part of the~ should die with 
the pestilence. &c. for bicause they 
had violated his holye in all offences 
and abhominations, agaynst 
the which pitifull se~tence 
sayth Agricola (verye godlye) no 
Christian wil obiect (no nor open 
their lippes as I suppose.) And 
here I wish al men (as no doubt 
if there be anye spotte or grace) 
with Cardanus continuallye to 
[/63./] 
call on Christ, and that wyth penitent 
harte, besechinge him for 
hys blessed passion sake, to defend 
vs from these .vii. calamities 
vniuersall, as earthquakes, 
[^f.F8v^] 
fluds, windes, beastes wild an 
venemous, war, famine, and pestilence, 
that hath no respecte to 
[/64./] 
no degrees. Hipp. sayeth, the times 
in the whiche Pestilences 
most reygneth and springeth, is 
Haruest and the Spryng, to the 
whiche common experience leadeth. 
Also that the places moste corrupt 
and of worst feding, is about 
S. Poulkars parish, by reason 
of many fruterers, pore people, 
and stinking lanes, as Turnagain 
laine, Secolayne, and such 
other places, there dyed most in 
London, and were soonest infected, 
and longest continued, as 
twyce sence I haue knowen Lo~don, 
I haue marked to be true, 
and in suche other lyke places in 
other Cityes, as Couentre, Bristow. 
[^f.G1r^] 
&c. The dyet that soonest 
causeth corruptio~, is that which 
is receyued by meats of yl norishment, 
as fruites, wynes, herbes, 
and al others of that kindes, also 
famine is euyl to be susteined. 
For the powers being to open, is 
made the readier to receiue infection: 
and also after fedinge to 
grossly corrupteth the body. To 
be short, for that many hath writen 
[/65./] 
herof alredy. Rasis out of the 
Assirian toung, translated a pretye 
libell into the Greke intreating 
of the pestilence, shewynge 
howe and by what signes it is 
perceiued to molest theym that 
[/66./] 
firste haue it: the backe aketh, a 
shewing in maner of y=e= grudging 
of an ague, cold therwithall, the 
body weried and heuy, geuen to 
[^f.G1v^] 
slumber, drousines of the heade, 
coughing slowly wa~bling of y=e= stomack, 
desier to drinke, lothing of 
meat. &c. But as it more encreaseth, 
[/67./] 
so Fucti~ sheweth y=e= the signes 
wilbe more veheme~t, lacking 
slepe, the whole body burneth of 
y=e= feuer, the head aketh, the cou~tenance 
chau~geth, yea and some 
waxe franticke, as testifyeth Silui~, 
[/68./] 
the which to be true, I once 
knew to wel my selfe. The pulse 
often beateth smal and depe, the 
vrine sauor and substa~ce like beastes 
troubled, thick and stinking 
Neurthelesse sometime I haue 
sene the vrine as if it had bene of 
a whole person. Wherefore it is 
not alwaye certaine, nor to be so 
estemed, as the greatest number 
accounteth: as if throughe an vrine, 
[^f.G2r^] 
there were alwaye suche 
truth, as that by it euery sicknes 
might be rightlye iudged: suche 
truth ther is in it as in a harlots 
promise, whether she promising 
to be true to one wil so co~tinue or 
no assuredly. I report me to you. 
If it be not hab nab, hitte misse, 
happy ma~ be his dole. The whiche 
Auice~ testifieth in this wise, 
[/69./] 
when vrine shall seeme to be of 
good disposition, ye muste not 
trust thervnto, for some times it 
is an euil signe, for manye times 
the pacie~t is not alterid through 
the heate of the feuer, neither in 
pulse, nor in vrine, and yet dyeth 
quickly. The reaso~is that venemous 
matter assaileth firste the 
hart, as the prince of the bodye, 
and cleueth therunto, that whe~ 
[^f.G2v^] 
nature seeth, the harte is greued 
with venemous matter, she dareth 
not assaulte the same, but 
goeth about to maintaine other 
members: and therfore somtime 
the pulse and vrine beinge good, 
& yet the pacient nie death. Furthermore 
the pulse in this ague, 
is busier in the night, then in the 
day, for the feuer is greater, and 
the pacient is shorter winded, 
and bretheth painfullier, and is 
verye thirstye, for the pipe of the 
lunges and mouth ben drye, the 
toung is white or yelowishe, in 
the ouerpart, and blacke in the 
top and swollen, the speach lost, 
and tast taken away, swounding 
and colde sweate, crampe, and 
suche lyke accidences in the extremity 
of the feuer alwayes is 
[^f.G3r^] 
found. Lastelye where nature is 
stronge in the Emungtories, the 
boche appeareth, accordinge to 
the places affected, as if y=e= braine 
vnder y=e= chin, eares, or throte, yf 
the hart vnder the arme holes, if 
the liuer in the flankes. &c. For 
euery member hath annexed vnto 
him a proper place, whereby 
to expell his annoyance, of the 
whych if any be stopped one can 
not be of long life. Here now gentel 
readers I thinke good to admonysh 
all such as haue had the 
plague, that they flee the trust of 
ignoraunt persons, who vse to 
saye that he who hath once had 
the plague shal not nede to feare 
the hauinge of it anye more: the 
whych by this example whyche 
foloweth (that chau~ced to a certaine 
[^f.G3v^] 
Bakers wife without Te~pel 
barre in London. Anno. Do. 
1563.) you shall find to be worthelye 
to be reiected: thys sayde 
wyfe had the plage at Midsommer, 
and at Bartholomew tide, 
and at Michelmas, and the first 
time it brake, the seconde time it 
brake, but ran littell, the thirde 
time it appeared and brake not: 
but she died. Notwythstanding 
she was twyce afore healed. Other 
some there be that holdeth 
opinion, that to flee from the infected 
parties doeth not profyt, 
the whych thynge is not only agaynste 
al reason, but also a conspiracy 
agaynst humaine kinde: 
for how maye a man better conspyre 
a mans death, the~ to bring 
him to a place, where in stede of 
[^f.G4r^] 
drinke he to receyue poyson, as 
hereof diuers hath had to good 
experience, as I my self infected, 
by reason that vnawares I lodged 
by chaunce with one that 
had it ru~ning vpon him, at that 
time in London when the commotion 
begonne in Northfolke, 
where yf the good helpe of Phisyck 
and Chirurgery had not preuailed 
(God them assystynge) no 
doubt I had perished. This my 
profe notwithstanding, you shal 
see what holye write sayeth for 
the auoyding from death. Christ 
our redemer in that he was ma~, 
desyred to eschew death: Wherfore 
[/70./] 
Paule said wel: no ma~ at any 
time hateth his owne flesh, but 
fauoreth & norisheth it: as doeth 
also very wel appeare by the holy 
[^f.G4v^] 
Prophetes of old, as Abraha~, 
Iacob, Esaye, Dauid in fleynge 
from Saule, and from his sonne 
Absolo~, also Elias the most bold 
Prophete. Moreouer Moyses 
fled into Egipt: perhappes here 
wyl some obiect and say, it was 
not for feare of y=e= plague, but for 
feare of death throughe persecutio~, 
I pray you cal you not death 
death, wherof soeuer the cause 
commeth, be it of the Pestilence, 
or of persecution, or famine, will 
you graunt it necessarye to flye 
from persecution, yea and frome 
famine, yea and to putte on clothes 
from steruing, but not from 
the plague, pestilence or famine, 
or from poysoned meat & drinke. 
Ha, ha, by my faith a trim obsurditye, 
by thys meanes a man falling 
[^f.G5r^] 
into a water, shal not seke to 
swim or to saue himself, but hold 
by hys handes to heauen, and 
dye therein, lykewise if a man be 
wou~ded in warrs or otherwise, 
he shal seke for no remedy but die 
through default, if a faule his 
leg or arme chau~ce out of y=e= ioint, 
he shall not seeke to haue it in again, 
if he be in a house & seing it 
redy to fall, he shal not go out of 
it, but thanke God and dye in it. 
How erronius thys is, I nede 
not ask y=e= wise, for the brute beastes 
throughe proper inclination 
perceueth. In conclusio~ we haue 
a worthy document manifestlye 
canonized, reprehendinge suche 
bablers: For the holye Prophete 
Ezakyath being extreme sicke of 
a pestilent feuer, prayed to God 
[/71./] 
[^f.G5v^] 
that he mighte bee made whole 
(as it is al mens part so to do) it 
pleased the lord to send him Izahyath, 
who applyed a plaster co~pound 
with fygs, vpon y=e= botch, 
by reason of the faculty wherof, 
drawinge foorth the venemous 
matter, he recouered. Finally as 
death is to be eschued: so where 
there is no remedye, the Christia~ 
ought cherefully to take it, as an 
exchaunge, to haue golde for 
leade: for trulye Beati mortui qui 
in domino moriuntur, and verilye 
for their mortal and corrupt bodies, 
they shal haue the same immortal 
and incorrupt, as the Deuines 
well proueth, of whom I 
reuerently take my leaue. 
 
[}Cap. 9}] 
 
[^f.G6r^] 
HItherto I haue commemorated 
(as you 
haue hard) y=e= kindes 
of feuers whych the 
humor putryfyinge 
wythin the vesselles do cause, it 
resteth now to expound those feuers, 
which are occasioned by y=e= 
humors, putrifying without the 
vessels: whan humors therefore 
do putrifye without the vessels, 
it is called an ague intermitting 
and it is so called bicause his fyt 
lasteth not alwayes, but remitteth 
sometimes. Wyth the Latynes 
it is called by an other 
name, Interpolata or interpolite, 
bicause it repeteth & reneweth 
hys fit in hys time, and therfore 
there be that calleth it a wa~ting 
feuer, of thys there be three special 
[^f.G6v^] 
differences, one is called Tertiana, 
or tertian, another Quotidiana, 
or quotidian, the thyrde 
Quartana, or quartaine. Againe 
the tertian is deuyded into two 
partes, namely into an exquisite 
sincere, and pure tertian, and also 
into a base and bastard tertia~. 
An exquisite tertian is whe~ pure 
red choler mingled with no other 
humor, putrieth without y=e= 
vessels, and is shewed in such as 
be of cholerycke complection or 
nature, and of stronge age, and in 
sommer time, and in hot and dry 
seasons, and regions, and lislye 
laboring folke, and in watchers, 
wyth suche as are to muche geuen 
to cares cogitacions, and venerious 
labors. In these fro~ the 
begynnyng in euery accesse, Rigor 
[^f.G7r^] 
(as I haue shewed afore. ca. 
vii.) and sharpnes, by the which 
it onlye differeth from febris ardens, 
it differeth also from the 
Rigor, quidring or sharpenes of 
the quartain in this, bicause the 
body semeth as it were prycked 
and exulcerated, and a verye lyke 
resingeration or coldnesse wyth 
the quartaine of the hibernall or 
winter season. It hapneth not 
that the Tertian feuer, is made 
wythout Rigor, shakyng & pricking, 
hurting as it were y=e= fleshe: 
the quartaine neyther inuadeth 
or cometh in the fyrst daye wyth 
Rigor quidring or sharpnes or 
it goyng forwardes, and encreased, 
the Rigor also is augmented 
and the sence of the sycke is 
not as of those whyche be prycked, 
[^f.G7v^] 
but rather which be cheled 
or coled, as it were molested or 
greued to the bones. There is also 
in the tertian exact order, and 
quality of the pulse, whyche yet 
natheles is exitated or styrred 
vehemently, great, yea and ofte~ 
in the increase of y=e= fyt, farther in 
vigor state or strength of the fit: 
it also causeth thyrste, & burneth 
so that hauing no clothes, yet is 
he constreyned to puffe & breath, 
supposyng hys bodye as it were 
in a flame, desiring cold water to 
drinke, or small colde drynke, and 
then by and by equally the heate 
is disse~ded or spred through the 
whole body: so that the stomach 
or brest is no more hot, then the 
extreme or outwarde partes for 
thy hand bryng laide on hym, at 
[^f.G8r^] 
the fyrst semeth to fele a certaine 
vaporous heat to rush forth, but 
not great after the hand hath remained 
a whyle: finallye vomiting 
of choler foloweth, and the 
bodye lowse, and vrine choleryck, 
subruse, somewhat yelowe, 
and meanely thyck: the vryne also 
by and by hath a white cloud 
or laudable sublation, the vryne 
also being more redder, and neyther 
suspencion or cloude appearyng 
in the fyrst circuit, the ague 
is extended or lengthned to seue~ 
circuites or fyts. Further the Ague 
leueth of where the fyt shall 
endure y=e= space of xii. equinoctial 
or euen howres. For thys tyme 
is very long in true tertians and 
iuste, sometyme I haue knowen 
the fyt shorter then the tyme afore 
[^f.G8v^] 
mencioned accordyng to the 
quantity and qualitye of choler, 
or of the strength of the pacyent, 
or the present affect of the bodye 
&c. We cal the feuer therfore saith 
[/72./] 
Fuctius, whyche endeth wythin 
xii. howres, Exactam tertianam, 
a perfyt Tertian. That whyche 
hath a longer accesse or fyt, that 
is not called Tertiana exquisita, 
but extense or lengthned, as Galen 
[/73./] 
sheweth more largely. But if 
Feuers inuade euery daye wyth 
vehement sharpnes, and with other 
notes, as we haue sayde of 
vrine and pulses, that is called 
Duplex tertiana or double tertia~, 
[/74./] 
all the whyche signes Galen declareth 
more abundantlye: this 
humor of all the humors in the 
body is y=e= most hottest, as partly 
[^f.H1r^] 
in the seuenth Chapter of thys 
worke I haue shewed, and also 
[/75./] 
dryeth as verifyeth Galen, the 
which daily we finde true by experience, 
by visiting of the like. 
 
[}Of the bastard Tertian feuer. Cap. 10}] 
 
THe bastarde or false 
Tertia~ is whe~ that 
red choler speciallye 
mixed with flewme 
doeth putrify, without 
the vessels, so that herevpon 
it is that euery note or sign doth 
[/76./] 
not pretende the nature of pure 
and sincere choler, as in the true 
and exquisit Tertian, for that also 
as you haue hard, the tyme of 
the accesse, excedeth not the 
terme of twelue howres, nor is 
not iudged as exquisite in seuen 
[^f.H1v^] 
circuites or fits: lastlye the signes 
 
of disgesting do appeare latelyer 
[/77./] 
in the bastarde tertian, nor there 
is not so great heate in the state 
of it, to these that be thus vexed, 
copy of swete hapneth, bicause it 
is not ended in that maner that 
the very Tertian is. 
 
[}Of the very quotidian feuer. Cap 11.}] 
 
AN exquisite or true 
quotidian is where 
swete flewme putrifieth 
without the vessels, 
this the Grekes 
[/78./] 
call [^GREEK OMITTED^] bicause it cometh by 
fyts euery daye. But if a glassye 
flegme be putrified not al equallye, 
but in halfe or part, that the 
Grekes cal [^GREEK OMITTED^] the Latines 
Epiala, in English sayth Doctor 
[^f.H2r^] 
Burd, the Epiall ague. In thys 
ague the sicke at one time feleth 
extreme feuerous heate and cold 
al ouer the body, as is me~cioned 
of Hieronimus Mont. yea & in euery 
[/79./] 
part therof, as testifieth Gale~ 
in thys wyse, sayinge they suffer 
both, that is extreme heat & cold 
the partes of the humor yet not 
putrifyed, and dispersed in the 
veines and other members of y=e= 
body, causing therfore the Rigor 
and extreme cold, but being once 
putrifyed, they kindle extreme 
heate, so that it is no maruell, 
that thys flegme causeth heate 
and cold at once, whe~ as it putrifieth 
but by littel through al the 
sencible partes of the body, thorow 
the whiche it is meued and 
caried, the verye cause why it is 
[^f.H2v^] 
called [^GREEK OMITTED^] sayeth Paulus, 
as thys Greke sente~ce wyl shew, 
is of [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
the which you mai 
thys vnderstande, in that it heateth 
the body softly and tenderly: 
as to them that knoweth the 
quality of vnnatural flewgme afore 
spoken in the beginninge of 
thys second section, may easelye 
appeare what kindes of them in 
thys feuer troubling accompanieth, 
as no doubt chiefly the glassye 
and watry, so that it semeth 
to me I maye in oure language 
name it the glassy watry flegme 
Ague. But in that we speake of 
the quotidian, you shall vnderstand 
cometh not with Rigor by 
and by the first daye, but rather 
[^f.H3r^] 
in proces of time frigus or coldenes, 
then Rigor troubleth, and 
the pulse assone as the fyt commeth 
is vnordinate and greate, 
for quotidians, by which a kynd 
of veheme~cy, but the heat is not 
so vehement and sharpe, as it is 
in the Tertians, for it neither 
burneth nor enforceth the sick to 
desier to be vtterlye vnclothed, 
nor so often to puffe and breath, 
or to desyer suche cold and small 
drinke. But semeth rather to be 
corrupted with vaporous moyst 
fumes, wherfore it is the longer 
or the heate be kindled, and the 
longer before it be consumed, yea 
or in the state. In conclusio~ they 
whiche haue thys Ague bee not 
greatly dry, bicause not onlye the 
toung, but also the whole bodye 
[^f.H3v^] 
is very moyst. The vrines be eyther 
thin, white and watrye, or 
thicke and troubled, no swete at 
all in the fyrst dayes appeareth, 
nor the sycke leaueth not vnder 
xviii. howres space, as I haue 
ofte~ tryed, the which in my boke 
of cures maye shewe at large the 
parties, place and age, constitucion 
and maner of the ministratio~ 
of sicknes. &c. vomets & flewgme 
appeareth vpwardes, and the 
stoole downewardes is colder, 
as rawe, watrie, moyst and flegmatik. 
This quotidian ague vexeth 
most accustomably, such as 
be of a flegmatik complection, 
and that vseth the like diet. And 
also in the same temperament 
tyme of the yeare, as in wynter 
yonge persons, yea and olde age, 
[^f.H4r^] 
and suche as desyer to bee ydel: 
herevpon it is that Galen wryteth, 
[/80./] 
as testifyeth Fuctius, that 
he did neuer see a yong man of a 
cholericke complection, age and 
dyet, haue the quotidian feuer, 
nor assuredly I haue not neither 
perfectly. But in more elder age, 
and flegmatick, & the more flegmatick 
therw=t= vsyng an idel life, 
& deinty fine meates, and delyte 
in drynkyng and bathyng, chiefly 
immediatly after meat, all the 
[/81./] 
which thinges Galen hath more 
largelye written, to the whyche 
you may repaire that be lerned, 
to thothers thys maye suffyce, 
and yet not vngratefull to the 
readers as I thinke. 
 
[}Of the very Quartaine ague. cap. 12}] 
 
[^f.H4v^] 
[/82./] 
QVartana exquisita, or 
intermittinge quartaine: 
groweth or co~meth 
[/83./] 
of black choler 
putrifying wythout 
[/84./] 
the vesselles, so called bicause it 
ceaseth two days, and returneth 
eyery fowrth day. This truly inuadeth 
[/85./] 
not by and by the firste 
daye with vehement Rigor and 
shaking, but is such in the whiche 
as if one fresed through cold, 
but when as it encreaseth, the 
Rigor or shaking is encreased also, 
growinge more greuous to 
the state of the sycknes, and it is 
not felt pricking or stinging the 
skinne, as it is in the exquisyte 
Tertian, but rather maketh 
the syck vehement colde, and the 
bones semeth so greuous in the 
[^f.H5r^] 
fleshe, as yf they were broken or 
brused, the pulse is very slowe in 
the beginning of the fytte. But 
when it is in his force and state, 
or height, then it is swyft & ofte~ 
beatinge, yet a certaine natural 
slownes and rariety is kept, if y=u= 
consyder the accident swyftnesse 
and oftennes of fits. But the motion 
of the heate eyther in augmenting 
or state is contrarye to 
the Tertian agues, For in thys 
Quartaine by littell and littell, 
the griefe encreaseth with great 
cold and shakinge, the whole body 
heauy and very sore, yea to y=e= 
bones, by reason of the coldnesse 
of this Saturnia~ melancholy. For 
when as any flamy heate is stirred, 
it leueth nothing furious or 
combust in the fytte of it, so that 
[^f.H5v^] 
herevpon it commeth that thys 
quartaine is of so longe terme. A 
yere, twoo, three, fower, fyue seue~. 
&c. Ptolome sayth fifty yeres, 
an Emperor of Rome hadde it, 
thirty yeres agreing to the yere 
of Saturne the planets course, 
the longest time that I knew anye 
haue it, was .xii. yeres agreing 
to the course of Iupiters yeres. 
But the Tertians and quotidians 
exquisite, are of no suche 
course or terme, yet some haue y=e= 
Tertian after the course of the 
yeres of the planet Mars, which 
is two yeres, and some the quotidian 
after the course of the yere 
of the moone, the whych is lesse 
then the yere of the same by .xi. 
dayes, as the lerned in Astronomy 
wel knoweth. Further vomit 
[^f.H6r^] 
of yelow choler doth not accompany 
quartaines, and the vrine 
is as it were wronge forth of filthy 
matter, thyn, white and watry 
with blacke groundes, or residence 
in the bottome of the water 
pot. Moreouer in Haruest it 
chiefly beginneth, waxinge to ecratical 
and vnstable agues. But 
here the nature of the syck muste 
be co~sidered, and temperament, 
thorder of dyet proceadinge, age 
and such lyke of the .x. thinges co~memorated 
in my Methode to 
the Phisition. And note that if 
it be cold and drye as affyrmeth 
Hali, the~ may it be iudged more 
[/86./] 
certainelie that quartaines wyll 
come and be alredy, especiallye in 
that, and when quartaines rayneth 
euerye where, as they dyd 
[^f.H6v^] 
of no long yeres past, of the whiche 
then I tasted parte, besydes 
my experience hadde of others. 
Nowe besydes these kindes of 
intermitting quartayn agues aforesayd, 
there be other some called 
[/87./] 
Quitaines, Sexties, Septuianes 
and Nonanes. Whereof 
[/88./] 
Hipp. mencioneth, so called bycause 
they were wont to come 
euery fift, sixte seue~th and ninth 
daye. But these be so rare that 
Galen affirmeth that he neuer 
saw anye haue the Septuianes 
[/89./] 
or Nonanes, yet saith Fuctius so~times 
he sheweth that he hathe 
sene the Quitaines in some, but 
not so certaine as quotidians or 
tertians and quartaines, nor I 
neuer sawe anye haue theym in 
England: but yet in Irelande at 
[^f.H7r^] 
a place called Carlough, I was 
enformed by M. Brian Iones 
then theyr Captaine, of a kerne 
or gentilman there that had the 
Quitaine long: but the rarietye 
considered, I passe them ouer, although 
I might say more of the~ 
supposinge this shall suffyce for 
this worke, in that we haue spoken 
of these Agues, whiche are 
kindled only through the occasio~ 
of putrifyed humors without any 
sole or one parte pained. But 
there be other Agues putrified, 
which are prouoked, by the occasion 
of some certaine partes or 
members pained, and that as foloweth 
in the next chapter.
