Touching the Names, and supposed 
rise of the Pox.}] 
 
1 TO give you a clear and 
ample Description of 
the Pox, I shall follow 
this Method. 1. Register 
all its Names, 2. Give 
you an ample Relation of its first 
rise or original. 3. Set down 
[^p.2^] 
the causes of it. 4. Exactly define 
its nature or essence. 5. Tell 
you the differences, or several 
kinds, sorts, stages, and degrees 
of the Pox. 6. Relate the signs 
and prognosticks. 7. Propose 
several nice and curious questions, 
with their answers upon the 
Pox, and those that are pockified. 
8. Describe twelve different 
ways or methods of curing 
the Pox. 
 
2. In Latin its called Variolæ 
magnæ, thence in Italian Varole 
grosse, and in French la gr_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sse verole, 
all signifying the great, or 
gross Pox. The French do also 
particularly name it, Le mal de 
Naples, or the evil of Naples, 
because it had its first rise among 
the Spaniards at Naples, in the 
Year, 1494. being besieged by 
the French; though the Spaniards 
say, the French bred it at 
[^p.3^] 
that very time, and therefore do 
call it I_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] ma_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] Francese, or the 
French Evil; the truth of this 
you'l read below. Among our 
Latin Authors its termed the Ind_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]an 
evil, the Indian Tetter, the 
Venereal Infection, the Tetter of 
the Privities, the New Campane 
Disease, the French Leprosie, 
the Spanish Itch, the French Disease, 
the Court Disease, the Disease 
a-la-mode, Job's manginess, 
the Dise_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]se of St. M_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]viu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] (whence 
the Germans to this day call it 
Meviu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]) St. Roches Disease, the 
Evil of St. Evagrius a Jerus_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]lem 
Frier, and S. Se_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ents Disease. 
The Dutch call it the Spanish 
Pox, the Indians La_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ua_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], 
Patursa and Pu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. What it's named 
in Eng_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sh is vulgarly enough 
known. 
 
3. Doctors have for a long 
time blazed into Heraldry for the 
[^p.4^] 
Coat of the Pox, to discover its 
first extraction, and antiquity of 
that great Family; at length it 
was held by a general vote, that 
its first descent was from the Neapolitan 
Spaniards, some of whom 
having been lately abroad with 
Columbus, in the Year 1492, upon 
the first discovery of the new 
World, or West Indies, after two 
Years absence, arrived back to 
their native Country, with a number 
of new pretty curious fangles, 
and among the rest, was 
this new pocky toy, which they 
soon made present of to several 
of their dearest Julietta's at 
Naples; for immediately upon 
their arrival in Spain, they were 
hurried away to Naples, to reinforce 
that Garrison, then in 
possession of Alphonso, King of 
Arragon, and blocked up by 
80000. French under command 
[^p.5^] 
of Charls the Eighth of France. 
The besieged being straitned 
of Provisions, were forced to 
dismiss their Mistresses, (already 
sufficiently rubbed with the Indian 
Loadstone,) into the Enemies 
Camp, where they met with 
very good quarters among those 
hungry Mushroms, almost starved 
for want of Womens flesh 
which they found so well seasoned 
and daubed with Mustard, that 
in few Weeks it took them all by 
the Nose. By this you observe, 
it's supposed the Spaniards first 
brought the Pox from the West 
Indies, where they said it was as 
natural to the Inhabitants, as the 
small Pox is elsewhere. Fi_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ravan_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]i 
denies that the Spaniards brought 
it from the West Indies, but affirms, 
the French being almost 
fami_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]h'd, first got the Pox, at 
the fore-said siege of Naples, by 
[^p.6^] 
eating dead Men's Carkasses, 
which he further makes proof of, 
by feeding a Sow with Sows flesh, 
likewise an Owl and a Whelp 
with flesh of their own kind, 
which he found afterwards markt 
with spots, botches, and pimples, 
like those of the Pox. Paracelsus 
saith, this Disease was bred 
between a French Leper, and a 
Neap_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]l_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]tan Whore, whilst she 
had her courses upon her. Astrologers 
write, the Pox was caused 
by an unlucky meeting of some 
of the Planets: though others 
again say, it was caused by Greek 
Wine, dash'd with Lepers blood, 
which the French drank, being 
purposely left for them at Sum_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
by the Sp_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]nia_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]d_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. Some report 
a Leper of Valentia in S_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ain first 
gave a noble Whore this disease, 
who since dispersed it among 
many others. Divines impute 
[^p.7^] 
the rise of it to Gods Judgment 
upon Adulterers and Fornicators. 
 
After all this many will have 
it, that the Pox reigned in the 
World long before the Year 
1494. and therefore say, that 
Hippocrates makes mention of 
some, that lost their Hair, and 
were troubled with malignant 
Ulcers about their Privities. 
Likewise Valescus, Salicetus, and 
Gordonius, (who lived 800. years 
before the siege of Naples,) wrote 
of Ulcers and Botches, contracted 
through the immoderate use 
of Women. Its likewise discoursed, 
that the Ethi_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]pians have for 
some hundred years been subject 
to a filthy Disease about their 
Groin and Privities, which they 
got by an over-wanton lechery; 
the same is also confirmed by Agatharcides. 
Avicenna writes of 
[^p.8^] 
a Sehaphatum or scabby Head, 
with many other accidents attending 
it, not unlike the Pox. 
Others say, the Pox is nothing 
but a kind of Leprosie, a St. Antonies 
Fire, or a kind of Plague. 
 
4. Those that conceive Job, 
St. Mivus, St. Evagrius, St. 
R_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]che, or St. Sement, to have been 
tormented with the Pox, or that 
the Pox had a being in Hippacrates, 
Avicen, V_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]lescus, Salic_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]tus, 
or Gordonius their times, some 
hundred years before the foresaid 
siege of Naples, must needs 
finde their mistake, in comparing 
the symptoms of those holy men, 
or those mentioned by the Authors 
before-written, with the 
symptoms of the Pox. Neither 
can any rationally suppose, the 
Pox to be a kind of Leprosie, 
since they do altogether differ 
from one another in symptoms, 
[^p.9^] 
and manner of Infection. Neither 
can I believe, the Spaniards 
brought the Pox first from the 
West Indies because a West-India 
Pox is no Epidemick, but an 
Endemick Disease, which is caused 
by a particular disposition of 
the Air, and their putrid diet; 
and therefore is equivalent to a 
Scurvy. Nevertheless its most 
certain the Pox was first bred 
among those Sp_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ni_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rds, that were 
arrived from the West-Indies at 
Naples, and the French that besieged 
the Town, though in another 
manner than is generally reported, 
as this following History 
of the Nativity of the Pox will 
confirm to you, being collected 
by me from several circumstances; 
that attended it at its birth. 
 
[^p.10^] 
[}ART. II. 
 
Containing the true History of the 
Pox, with the Auth_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rs discovery 
of its rise and causes.}] 
 
5. THe French with their entailed 
manginess marching 
into Ital_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] in the Year 1493. 
under Charls the VIII. of France, 
against Alpho_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]so King of Arragon, 
did daily fret, and promote 
their evil by drinking gross 
Italian Wines, eating salt Meats, 
and broyling under a hotter Sun; 
and as their Wines grew stronger, 
Victuals salter, and Sun hotter, 
by their deeper in-road into 
the Country, so their disease accrew'd 
in greater scabs and malignity. 
At last being come to 
their Journeys end, and seated 
before Naples, they felt themselves 
[^p.11^] 
encompassed with a more 
scorching Air, and feeding upon 
powdered Boars flesh, they were 
press'd to gorge down Rivers of 
Wine, hotter and stronger than 
before; all which had sublimed 
(or heightned) their Disease to 
so extream an high pitch of manginess, 
that consisting in inflamed 
itching scurf, and damnable infection, 
it was communicated to 
their inward parts, in as furious a 
degree, as to their outward. This 
inward and outward itching brined 
& pickl'd diet, meeting with 
a dust (or burnt) melancholy 
tempers, could not but kick and 
spur some of them into a most 
detestable rage of letchery, who 
encountring with ranck Jades, 
(being pernicious through their 
menstruous steems, and disgraced 
with the worst degrees of 
Scurvy, crept in upon them by 
[^p.12^] 
their ill Diet within the surrounded 
City,) fell foul of the handsomest, 
that probably had been 
over-ridden, galled, inflamed, and 
set on Fire by their Comrades before. 
In this sharp conflict showrs 
of morbifick emissaries (or diseased 
steems) darted from each 
party, confronted, united, embraced, 
and were knitted together 
into intire compound minimal 
(or very small) Bodies, 
which were the flower, soul, and 
abridgement of the whole clot, 
whereout they were sublimed (or 
forced) and consequently did partake 
of the worst of their qualities 
and symptoms, which now 
are become the genuine (or true) 
pocky ones. 
 
6. The truth of this Narra_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ive 
depends upon the proof of 
_[^ORIG. BLANK^]hese four circumstances. 1. That 
_[^ORIG. BLANK^]he French army was at that tim_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
[^p.13^] 
troubled with the scabby Itch. 
2. That the Itch can be sublimed, 
or raised to a higher pitch, in 
manner aforesaid. 3. That the 
Neapolitan Curtizans were troubled 
with the Scurvy. 4. That 
the Pox was begotten by a mangy 
French-man and a Neapolitan 
Whore, that was troubled with 
the Scurvy; or in short, that the 
Pox is caused by a commixture 
of a scabby itch, and an inveterate 
Scurvy. 
 
7. In relation to the first, it's 
most certainly known, that a 
Frenchman upon the least change 
of Air, ever contracts the Itch; 
or if it should fail him Spring, or 
Fall, immediately doubts of his 
health; more-over where any 
one is accustomed to Wine, and 
a sharp hot Diet, as peppered, Onion, 
Anchovy, and Garlick Sawces, 
and is slovenish in his Linnen, 
[^p.14^] 
living besides in a hot Climate, its 
impossible he should escape the 
Itch, much less in an Army, where 
they are all slovens in their Linnen, 
and Cloaths, in the highest 
degree, and one infects the other, 
and feeds the D_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ase with a brined 
and pickled Diet. In fine, 
never did a French Army pass a 
Campane, without being tormented 
with theItch in the worst 
degree; what pickl the French 
Army used to be in Flanders, 
where the Air is far more temperate 
than in Italy, my self have 
been an eye-witness. As to the 
second, it's generally observed, 
that by continuation of a hot 
Diet, and not shifting of Linnen, 
a small Itch, with little black 
h_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ds, will change into red mattery 
pimples, and those into scaling 
scabs, which at length will 
turn into great broad scurf, like 
[^p.15^] 
a Leprosie. To the third, as most 
Towns that are situated upon the 
Sea, are subject to some endemick 
Disease or other, so Naples hath 
ever been disposed to an imperfect 
Scurvy, which being besieged, 
and the Inhabitants penned 
up in Rooms, using no exercise, 
and dieting upon course dreggish 
powdered Boars flesh, old hard 
mouldy Biscuit, and slimy musty 
Water, (for their Fountains were 
filled with dirt, and the Air with 
stinks of Carrions, dead Carkasses, 
and putrid saltish vapours of 
the Sea,) they must unavoidably 
have been forced into a very deep. 
Scurvy; for the adequate cause 
being put into action, the effect 
must necessarily follow. The 
fourth is, that the Pox is begotten, 
between a mangy Frenchman 
and a Neapolitan Whore, 
that was troubled with the Scurvy; 
[^p.16^] 
or to speak more plain, the 
Pox is a complicated, mixt, or 
compounded Disease, that's engendred, 
bred, and knitted together 
out of a deep Scurvy, and a 
fiery malignant manginess. That 
it is a mixt Disease, is discovered 
by the mixt signes, symptoms, 
(or accidents) some issuing from 
the scabby Itch, others from the 
Scurvy. First, I'le demonstrate 
the Pox to be a true Scurvy. 
2ly. That it's also a perfect manginess. 
3ly. That it is neither a 
Scurvy nor manginess singly by 
themselves, but a Disease that is 
engendred or bred out of a Scurvy 
and manginess, being complicated 
and knit together. 4. That 
the Scurvy, whereof the Pox 
doth consist, is not such a common 
Endemick Scurvy, as the 
Air doth breed here in England; 
but an Epidemick Scurvy, much 
[^p.17^] 
differing from the other. As to 
the first, that the Pox is a true 
Scurvy, may rationally be granted, 
because the time and place of 
the rise, or beginning, growth, 
height, ending, signs, or symptoms, 
properties, causes, and 
cure of the Scurvy and Pox are 
the same, as will appear to you 
in every particular. The Pox 
it's agreed by most Authors had 
its birth at Naples, and so had 
the Scurvy; for before the year 
1495. it was never heard of, 
nor mentioned by any, but is 
recorded by several to have 
received its birth and name at 
Naples in the Year aforesaid. It 
was then called S_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rn_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]-Bo_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ca, or 
foul mouth, (from Scorno a foul 
or shameful thing, and bocca 
mouth,) and from thence the other 
names Scorbutum and Sc_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rbeck 
were derived. The next 
[^p.18^] 
year after, it was observed to be 
spread among the Hollanders, 
and Flemmings, being transported 
thither by the Spanish Souldiers, 
that were sent from Naples 
to Garrison among them, who 
from the Italian named it Scorbeck. 
The P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x generally begins 
with a lassitude or soreness of 
ones Limbs, weakness of the 
Knees and Legs, with a small 
pain about the Shins, and oppression 
about the middle, blossoms 
into Pinck-colour spots like fleabites, 
&c. Even so begins the 
Scurvy. The P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x in its growth 
buds into red, yellow, or duskish 
pimples, especially about the forehead, 
and appears with a great 
change of the complexion, and 
a deep melancholy, and so doth 
the Scurvy. Being arrived to its 
height, it's attended with foul 
Ulcers scattered over the Body, 
[^p.19^] 
and flying retching pains, racking 
the Body most in the 
night, &c. Exactly so doth the 
Scurvy appear in its height. At 
last the Pox ends into fistules, 
rottenness of the Bones, torturing 
fixt pains, Dropsies, Consumptions, 
Fevers, &c. Into 
which likewise the Scurvy makes 
its ending. In short, there is no 
sign, or symptom in the Pox, but 
it's observed to be in the Scurvy, 
so likewise there is scarce a sign 
in the Scurvy, but its discerned 
in the Pox, which is the reason 
why Physicians do daily mistake, 
in judging some to be troubled 
with the Pox, that are troubled 
with the Scurvy; and others to 
be diseased with the Scurvy, that 
are infected with the Pox. Moreover 
it's a property of the Pox 
never to appear with the same 
signes in two Bodies, but in one 
[^p.20^] 
Body is attended with such signs, 
in another quite different; which 
is also proper to the Scurvy. 
Lastly, the Pox is oft cured with 
Vegetables, that are of a biting 
stinging nature, and contain a 
great deal of mordicant volatil 
Salt, as Guaiacum, Soapwort, Persicaria, 
&c. which are also proper 
remedies for the Scurvy. To 
the second, that it is a manginess, 
is evidently discovered by its 
itching, running scabs, and scurf, 
besides Pocky Ulcers are generally 
covered with mangy scabs. 
To the third, though the Pox and 
the Scurvy be so very like, it's 
visible enough, they be not the 
same, but differ in malignity or 
fierceness of symptomes; for 
though the Pox and Scurvy are 
both featured with pimples, borches, 
and Ulces, yet those in 
the Scurvy are less painful, and 
[^p.21^] 
less inflam'd, and better colour'd. 
2. In infection, the Pox being 
far more infectious than the 
Scurvy. 3. In itching scabs, and 
crusty Ulcers, which are not discovered 
in the Scurvy. So that 
you may plainly discern the Scurvy 
to be a kind of mild Pox, and 
wants nothing but malignity of 
symptoms, a stronger sting of 
infection and itching scabs and 
scurff; all which the before-mentioned 
manginess doth contribute 
to it; and so consequently 
out of their union and coalescence 
the Pox must necessarily 
result. Furthermore, that manginess 
is so neer a kin to the Pox, 
the cure doth plainly confirm 
Mercury being a known and experienced 
remedy for them both, 
besides the Night pains and crusty 
pustles and Ulcers, that attend 
manginess, do fully demonstrate 
[^p.22^] 
it. Lastly, do but observe 
the mangy symptomes recorded 
by Hugo Senensis, Cons_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. 
73. de cu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. inf. and Gasper Torrel. 
Cons. 5. adv. pud. And you 
must necessarily grant a malignant 
manginess to be Pocky, as 
those do that call the Pox _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]b's 
manginess. St. Lazarus, or St. 
Sement's disease. But those that 
are curious to be better resolved 
upon that point, let them endeavour 
to procure my great Venus 
unmask'd. Here you may be resolved, 
why the Pox proves so infectious 
by copulation, viz. because 
it's ingendred out of two very 
infectious Diseases, and conveyed 
by the Seed, which as it is the 
spirits contracted, and flower of 
all the blood of the Body, so 
must it likewise consist of the 
spirits contracted, and flower of 
all the infection, or infected blood 
[^p.23^] 
of the whole Body. To the 4th 
Note, 1. There are two sorts of 
Scurvy, one Endemick that's engendred 
by the Air, and constitution 
of the place where it 
reigns, as this here in Englan_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], 
& that of Lisbon, or Holland. The 
other is Epidemick, and is by far 
more malignant, durable, and of 
a more difficult cure, and is only 
propagated or dispersed by infection, 
which is that Scurvy, which 
was ingendred at Naples, and is 
commonly left in the Body after 
the sting of the Pox is taken off. 
This Scurvy is very common also 
here in England, and being mistaken 
for the other kind of 
Scurvy by our Hackney-Physicians, 
is the cause why many are 
left incurable. This is that deep 
Scurvy, that was ingendred at 
Naples, by their most putrid 
feeding, stinking Air, and particular 
[^p.24^] 
constellation at that time, 
which then proved to be the Mother 
of the Pox. 
 
[}ART. III. 
 
Of the nature and kindes of 
the Pox.}] 
 
7. MY fourth particular puts 
me in mind of the definition 
of the Pox, which Ferrerius 
defines to be a putrefaction 
of humours, contracted for 
the most part through infection 
by copulation, by communicating 
venemous exhalations and 
infected Spirits. Steeghius describes 
the Pox to be a venomous 
quality, which for the most part 
is taken by a venereal contract, 
causing several kinds of pimples, 
Ulcers, pains, and other accidents, 
[^p.25^] 
Mercurial saith, it's a 
disposition against Nature, injuring 
the Natural Operations, 
through unknown means. The 
generality of Physicians define 
the Pox to be a hidden Disease, 
contracted by malignant vapors, 
that are communicated from a 
pocky Body. These definitions 
being partly false, and very imperfect, 
shall set down one that's 
more full and plain, though not 
so perfect, as that I proposed in 
my greater Venus Unm_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sk'd, that 
being fram'd only for Scholars. 
I say then, The Pox is an universal 
moveable Disease, caused by venemo_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s 
infectious ste_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ms, and attended 
with the worst and mildest, 
most and fe_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rest, changeable and 
uncertain sympt_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ms of all _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]inds. 
The sense of this description I'l 
further explain to you. The Pox 
is an universal Disease, i. _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. in respect 
[^p.26^] 
of the parts where it's seated, 
for sometimes it's seated in 
the Liver, and then it's attended 
with spots, pimples, and Ulcers; 
sometimes in the brain, and then 
it's accompanied with pocky 
rheums and defluxions, Nightpains, 
Ulcers in the Palate, and 
Nose; other-times it's seated about 
the privities only, or about 
the breast, or any other part. 
2. The Pox is an universal disease, 
in regard it comprehends 
all kinds of diseases; for sometimes 
it's a hot disease, witness 
the heat of Urine in the Running 
of the R_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ins, hot botches, pimples, 
buboes, rubi_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s of the forehead, 
and pocky Feavers; othertimes, 
it's cold, as appears by 
those cold pocky Night-pains, 
and cold hard swellings; it's 
likewise a moist Disease, as you 
may observe by it's Ulcers, pocky 
[^p.27^] 
Gouts, rheums, or defluxions. 
It's not seldom found to be a dry 
Disease, namely, when it turns 
into a pocky hectick. Lastly, level'd 
Noses, devoured Palats, and 
Limbs put out of joint by pocky 
nodes conclude the Pox to be a 
Disease of conformation, number, 
magnitude, scituation, and discontinuated 
unity. In short, the Pox 
is a Monarch, all other Diseases 
are its subjects, for there is no 
Disease, but one time or other is 
noted to accompany it. The Pox 
is movable in three particulars. 
1. It's movable, skipping like a 
Grass-hopper, from one part to 
another, to wit, from the part 
that was first infected to the 
Liver, thence to the brain, and 
so patroules round, till it hath 
made an entry and seisin upon 
the entire mannor of the body. 
2. In moving out of one disease 
[^p.28^] 
into another, from a hot, to a cold 
Distemper, from an inflamation 
into an Ulcer, from an Ulcer into 
a carnosity, thence into a constirpation 
or stoppage. 3. It moves 
from one symptom to another, 
from a scalding Urin, into the 
Running of the Reins, thence to 
pocky spots and pimples, and 
thence to Ulcers & Night-pains, 
and thence again into consumptions 
and hectick Fevers. I said 
the Pox was attended with the 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]orst and mildest, m_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]st and fe_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]est 
symptoms, that is, sometimes the 
Pox is usher'd with very malignant 
torturing accidents or symptoms, 
as racking Night-pains, 
and filthy Ulcers or running 
sores, other times again it's accompanied 
with very mild accidents, 
as spots only or pimples, 
or some slight joint-pains; sometimes 
again the Pox hath a great 
[^p.29^] 
many followers; often times very 
few, it may be a pimple, two 
or three, or a botch three or 
four only, &c. Lastly, the symptoms 
of the Pox are very 
changeable and uncertain; for among 
five thousand pocky bodies, 
you shall scarce find two 
troubled alike with the same accidents. 
 
8. The Pox is usually distinguisht 
into a slighter, and worser 
sort, the slightest sort of all is, 
when only the hair of the head 
and beard sheds, and then the 
venom consists in a vapor, that's 
flown to the roots of the hair: 
The second kind is somewhat 
worse, wherein the whole skin is 
markt with red yellow spots, and 
there the venom sits in the thinnest 
of the blood. The third sort 
is yet worse, and is the true Pox, 
where red and yellow pimples 
[^p.30^] 
do first break out about the 
forehead and temples, and near 
the ears, afterward on the head, 
and over the whole body: they 
are round and dry without matter, 
which afterwards are covered 
with a dry scab, and of_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
turn into foul running sores. 
Here the venom is in the Liver, 
and the whole mass of blood. 
The fourth and last degree, is, 
when the Pox gets into the 
bones and sinews. 
 
9. The Pox is also distinguisht 
into a ne_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] or fresh Pox, when 
it's not of above a years standing; 
into ro_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ted or confirmed, 
which is from a year or two or 
three years; and into an inveterate 
Pox, when it's above three 
years old. 
 
10. My practical observations 
upon the motion of the Pox, 
have discovered to me a far more 
[^p.31^] 
proper distinction. The Pox 
like a Pilgrim on his road makes 
four stages. The infection being 
yet seated in the outward part 
that was first assaulted, namely, 
the jaw, the lips, groin, tets, &c. 
may properly be called a Liminary 
P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x, because it's set as it were 
in the threshold or entrance of 
the Body. The second stage is 
at the fleshly membrane, (Membrana 
carnosa) where encountring 
with another stand, it is 
constrained to halt for a while; 
hitherto we may term it the Frontier 
Pox, because it is yet tracing 
the frontiers or confines of the 
body; thence passing through 
the flesh of the muscles, and other 
membranes, makes a third 
halt at the proper membranes 
(or skins) of the entrails; here 
meeting the Pox at mid-way, we 
may properly stile it the M_[^ORIG. BLANK^]d_way 
[^p.32^] 
P_[^ORIG. BLANK^]x. Thence it gallops 
strait-way to the depth of the 
entrails, where with an authority 
it's proclaimed a _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ho_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ou P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x. 
In this manner you may be assured 
the Pox moves, having traced 
its motion exactly in some hundreds 
of bodies. 
 
11. The Pox is sometimes stiled 
mi_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]d, when possibly it begins 
with a dozen of pimples, a glancing 
pain of the thighs, or shins, 
a small gleetnig at the Yard, &c. 
Other times it's termed rough, 
and malignant, assaulting the Patient 
with a green running of the 
Reins, two Buboes, and a Crystalli_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], 
raging Shankers, a burning 
S_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rangury, and a Fever through 
fierceness of the pain, in the increase, 
start up foul eating Ulcers, 
racking Night-pains. 
 
12. Some sorts of Pox are 
more infectious, others less. 
[^p.33^] 
Sometimes it's hereditary, or got 
from ones Parents in the Womb; 
other-times it's got by infection. 
Some kind of Pox is visible and 
evident; other kind lieth hidden 
for some years, before it breaks 
out. Ho_[^ORIG. BLANK^]st_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]us writes of one, that 
got the Pox in his youth, and did 
not appear before he was grown 
old. Am_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]u_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] speaks of another, 
who was troubled with a hidden 
Pox, and got two sound Children, 
but the third proved infected 
with a rank Pox. The 
Mother of those Children enjoyed 
her health very well, until 
she was delivered of that last 
pocky Child, and then her Lips 
and Breast bursted out into the 
Pox. This pocky Boy was put 
to Nurse, who in few days was 
infected, and thereupon infected 
her Husband, and two Children 
more, that she gave suck to. 
[^p.34^] 
These Children were no sooner 
taken home, but infected their 
Mothers; in short, no less than 
Nine were infected in a Moneths 
time. When I lived at Paris, I 
knew a whole Family, that was 
in the like manner infected by a 
pocky Nurse. Here in London, 
I have likewise taken notice of 
several Children, that died at 
Nurse of the Pox, and therefore 
People ought to be well-advised, 
to whom they put out their Children. 
 
[^p.35^] 
[}ART. IV. 
 
Containing a further confirmation 
of the causes of the Pox.}] 
 
13. MY next business is to 
treat of the cause of 
the Pox. I have made it appear 
to you already, that the Pox was 
not brought from the West-Indies 
hither; neither was it engendred 
out of Mans flesh, for 
the Cannibals, and others, that 
feed altogether upon Mans flesh, 
are seldom troubled with that evil. 
I have likewise proved, the 
Pox was not begotten by a French 
Leper, because of the vast difference 
there is between the Leprosie, 
and the Pox. 
 
Many affirm, the Pox was kindled 
by a malignant constellation 
of the Planets; but let me tell 
[^p.36^] 
you, had the mangy French crew 
been diverted from coming to 
N_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ples, the Pox would have continued 
among the Planets. Others 
impute the cause of the Pox to 
the common trade whores drove 
with several Nations, whose seed 
being forced and gathered together 
in one Womb, might occasion 
a kind of a rotten Disease in 
the privities, like several sorts of 
Meat, cause a corruption in the 
stomach. But this seems improbable, 
because there having been 
whores from the beginning of the 
World, who drove a common 
Trade, they would necessarily 
have bred the Pox long before 
the siege of Naples. It was the 
opinion of some, that the Pox 
was sent into the French Camp 
by a Neapolitan Witch, whose 
House they had robbed; but this 
seems ridiculous to those, that 
[^p.37^] 
believe now Miracles are ceased, 
there be no Witches more in 
Nature. 
 
Leonicenus believed, the Pox 
took its rise from a great overflowing 
of the river _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]yber. which 
vomited up a deal of stinking 
rotten bodies, into a tract of the 
Air, that drove towards Naples, 
where it soon kindled the Pox. 
This is unlikely, since the same 
River had overflown many times 
before, without causing such a 
contagious Disease. 
 
The Germ_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s were of opinion, 
that feeding too oft upon Pease 
and B_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]con might breed the Pox, 
and therefore their Magistrates 
forbad the selling of all sorts of 
Pease. This opinion is so unreasonable, 
that it need_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] no confutation. 
 
3. After the recital of all these 
opinions, touching the outward 
[^p.38^] 
cause, or the first occasion of the 
Pox, it's time I should bend my 
discourse to a discovery of the 
inward cause, which by the generality 
of modern Physicians is 
concluded to be a hidden malignant 
cause, or certain malignant 
steems, that pass from one body 
into another, effecting such 
pocky accidents (or symptoms,) 
by hidden means. But our modern 
Authors and Physicians are 
very full of their hidden causes 
and hidden diseases, which to me 
signifies no more than fa, fa; 
and therefore shall proceed to 
give my Reader a plainer and 
more satisfactory resolve. I have 
already clearly proved to you, 
that the Pox had its first rise 
from a complication of a Scurvy, 
with a mangy Itch, and a commixture 
of both their causes; 
so that sh_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]wing the inward causes 
[^p.39^] 
of a manginess and Scurvy, 
you may thence collect the inward 
cause of the Pox. The inward 
cause of a Scurvy is thick 
dreggish blood, that begins to 
fret, and grows fiery salt and 
gnawing; the inward cause of 
manginess is a burnt red gall, or 
rather adust blood volatilized, 
which through its fieriness renders 
the blood fiery, salt, and 
itching. Now suppose a Frenchman, 
that is troubled with an extreme 
fiery itching manginess, by 
reason of the fieriness of his 
blood, and acting the part of a 
furious Goat, with a fretted Neapolitan 
Whore, that's troubled 
with a deep fiery Scurvy, the very 
essence of this Salt, fiery and 
itching blood flyeth out in steems 
into the body of the Ne_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]p_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]litan 
Whore, where meeting with the 
steems of her fiery gnawing scorbutick 
[^p.40^] 
blood, do unite and knit 
together into perfect little steemy 
bodies, or atoms, which you 
must necessarily conceive to be 
very malignant, ulcering, gnawing, 
and fiery, so that the next 
that converses with this Whore 
must needs draw these ulcering 
steems into his body, where 
through their gnawing malignant 
and ulcerous quality, they 
cause a Running of the Reins, 
or Ulcers in the Yard, or other 
pocky accidents. Next, suppose 
these little pocky steemy bodies 
being drawn into the body, have 
a power of breeding and multiplying 
into other pocky little bodies 
of their own kind, and so 
having filled the veins and arteries 
with such pocky gnawing 
steems, they cause scurffy pimples, 
gnawing pains and Ulcers 
all over the body. So now I have 
[^p.41^] 
in few words and very plainly 
unfolded the causes of the Pox, 
and all its symptoms, which possibly 
hath not been performed 
before; and if this short Discourse 
will not satisfie, read my 
greater Venus Unmask'd, and that 
very probably may. 
 
[^p.42^] 
[}ART. V. 
 
Of the Signs, Symptoms, and Prognosticks 
of the P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x, Running 
of the Reins, Buboes, and 
Shanckers.}] 
 
14. TO describe the signs and 
symptoms, or accidents 
of the Pox; it will be expedient, 
First, to set down what pickle a 
man finds himself in presently after 
he has convers'd with a pocky 
Wench, namely a sharpness of 
Urine, and pressing to m_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ke water, 
though he made water but 
just before; a heat in his Yard, 
which soon after o_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sions an erection, 
and consequently a desire 
to repeat his former action, 
and so having finisht his complement 
once more, he immediatly 
begins to dribble hot and sharp 
[^p.43^] 
Urin by little and little, or sometimes 
by drops only; the next 
day he finds himself sore all about 
his Limbs, dull, heavy, and 
melancholy, and a little gleeting 
at his Yard, especially if he 
squeese it out hard with his 
hand; two, or three, or four days 
after, he may squeese out a greasie 
yellow matter; some eight, 
ten, twelve, or fourteen days after, 
(in some sooner, and in others 
longer,) it begins to drop 
yellow and greenish, and stain 
his shirt, which dropping is called 
a Virulent Ghonorrhee, or a 
Pocky Running of the Reins. 
 
15. This Pocky Running of 
the Reins is sometimes accompanied 
with a terrible hot pricking 
and smarting Urin, and an often 
erection of the Yard, feeling hard, 
and knotty like a Cord, and 
therefore it's called a Cordee, 
[^p.44^] 
which Cord_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] is extremely pricking 
and painful, insomuch that 
one cannot endure to touch himself, 
nor suffer any thing else to 
touch him; besides the extremity 
of the pain causes the head 
of the Yard to turn downward, 
and seem crooked. 
 
16. This is the common case 
men find themselves in, though 
some again may trade with the 
same Wench, that gave others a 
Running of the Reins, and may 
get off with heat and sharpness 
of Urin, a few slight flying pains 
of the Shins, Thighs, and Arms, 
without any thing else. Others 
again escape the Running of the 
Reins, and sharpness of Urin, 
and some seven or eight Dayes 
after, or longer, get an eating 
Ulcer, or sore upon the head of 
the Yard, or the Skin that covers 
it, or in the passage they make 
[^p.45^] 
their water through; This sort 
of eating Ulcer is called a Shanker, 
which oft proves so malignant, 
that in few dayes it will 
rot and eat off the whole Yard. 
Sometimes when there is a Shanker, 
or eating sore in the Vrethra, 
or passage of the Urin, there 
will be apt to grow proud flesh 
out of it, which causes one to 
piss in double streams, and in 
time doth quite stop up the passage, 
and so hinder one from 
making Water; this is called a 
C_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]runcle. Some upon a pocky 
adventure escape these forementioned 
accidents, but instead of 
'em, they get a painful little button 
in their groin, which is named 
a Poula_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n; this in few days 
will grow bigger, red, and inflamed; 
sometimes to the b_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]gness 
of a Pidgeons or Hens Egg, and 
then it's termed a Bub_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], feeling 
[^p.46^] 
full of pain, looks very red and 
angry, and for the most part the 
party hath a Fever with it, and a 
scalding Urin. Other times there 
will appear a blain or blister upon 
the Glans or head of the 
Yard, commonly called a Crystallin. 
Venereal, or Pocky 
Whar_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s generally grow about 
the Prepuce, (or the top of the 
Skin, that covers the Yard,) and 
upon the glans, and sometimes all 
over the Yard, Pocky grandoes 
are little hard knots, of the bigness 
of a Pea, appearing in the 
same places pocky Wharts do. 
Women are troubled with the 
same accidents, and some others, 
viz. virulent Courses, that look 
yellow or deep red, and are very 
hot & smarting. Likewise Virulent 
Whites, being thick streeky, and 
sometimes thin, sharp, and gnawing. 
These are most of the accidents 
[^p.47^] 
or symptoms of a Liminary 
Pox. Before I proceed further, 
I will tell you the different 
opinions of Physicians upon a 
Running of the Reins. Most do 
judge the running to proceed 
from Ulcers of the Prostats, being 
small bladders lying at the 
root of the Yard, that are made 
for little Cisterns to keep the 
Seed in. This certainly is erroneous, 
for if those Prostats, being 
spermatick, should be Ulcer'd, 
and in part eaten away, 
they could never be heal'd up, 
and so consequently a man would 
be troubled with the running for 
ever. Others are of Opinion, 
the running proceeds from a 
weakness of the said spermatick, 
or seedy Vessels, and so are rendred 
incapable of retaining the 
Seed. Here they suppose the 
matter, that drops out at the 
[^p.48^] 
Yard, to gleet from the Pr_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]stat_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
if so, then necessarily they would 
be ulcered by the gnawing quality 
of the infected Seed, and so 
consequently as I shewed before, 
be rendred incurable. But after 
all, it's certain, that the matter 
that drops out at the Yard, is 
neither Seed nor seedy; for Seed 
be it never so much alter'd, hot, 
yellow, or green, yet it will keep 
its clamminess, and be ropy, so 
that it may be drawn from one 
another between ones fingers; 
whereas that which gleets in the 
Running of the Reins, is not at 
all clammy or ropy, nor can it 
be drawn between the fingers, 
but falls all into small drops, and 
is perfect matter, such as is bred 
in Ulcers. Besides, should all that 
dropping in a pocky running be 
Seed, it would wast a Man to nothing; 
moreover, it's common 
[^p.49^] 
for Men, that have a pocky running 
upon them, to beget such 
Children; which is a sign the 
Seed is free from infection for 
some time. Wherefore I conclude 
the pocky Running of the 
Reins to be an Ulcer of all the 
whole Yard, where the infection 
turns its clammy blood into perfect 
matter (or Pus,) which 
gnaws its way out, through the 
Urethra, or passage of the Urin: 
that this is so, is evident. 1. In 
a Gonorrhee the Yard is generally 
swelled all over. 2. The Yard 
is hot, and full of pain all over, 
by reason of the gnawing pocky 
matter it contains within the 
pores of its spungy flesh. 3. That 
that virulent or pocky matter 
doth sweat through, or gnaw its 
way through into the Urethra, 
doth appear hence, that if one 
press the Yard close about the 
[^p.50^] 
middle, so that no matter may 
pass from the root, (where the 
Pr_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]stats are supposed to be,) and 
with his other hand gently squeese 
it near the Glans, or the top, he 
shall in so doing press out a great 
quantity of matter out of the 
body of the Virge, which cannot 
be supposed to come from 
the Pr_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sta_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s, because this other 
hand intercepts or keeps that 
in, which otherwise might be 
thought to proceed thence. Besides 
there is a pricking pain all 
along in the Vrethra, which is 
nothing but the gnawing biting 
matter, that bores through, out 
of the body of the Yard into the 
Uret_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ra. Lastly, observe that 
though for a long time this matt_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
is not seedy, yet afterwards 
it grows seedy, by reason the 
Pocky steems do at length so 
weaken the Prostats, that they 
[^p.51^] 
are apt to shed Seed, which is 
also the cause, why the gleeting 
proves seedy at last, when a running 
of the Reins is almost 
Cured. 
 
To these I'll add a new symptom 
of a Liminary Pox, former 
Ages have not been subject 
unto, viz. A retraction or 
Contraction of the Virge: Which 
in some appears so much retracted 
in the body as it were, 
that scarce any part else remains 
visible but the Glans. 
This symptom hath seldom any 
other accompanying it than 
a sharpness and heat of Urine, 
and a frequent desire to make 
water. The cure hereof is very 
difficult, which not being 
performed according to Art, 
turns into a more malignant 
Pox. 
 
[^p.52^] 
Likewise all about the neck 
of the Matrix in women. 
 
[}ART. VI. 
 
Comprehending the Signs of a 
Frontier, Midway, and Theron-Pox.}] 
 
17. THe Signs of a Frontier 
Pox, or the beginning 
of a true French Pox, are, when 
the Skin is flourished with red or 
yellow spots, like Flea-bites; 
sometimes the fore-head only is 
disgraced with round hard pimples, 
like Mulberries, a little crusty 
a top, and markt with black 
specks, some being dry, others 
moist, and are oft dispersed to 
[^p.53^] 
the Ears, thence to the Neck, 
Arms, Shoulders, Breast, but 
chiefly to the Groin and Perinæ_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. 
These Pimples do oft vanish, 
and suddenly appear again, 
or sometimes change into adust 
(or burnt) Ulcers. They are 
likewise subject to an universal 
itc_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ing of the Body, and a certain 
feeling, as if their whole 
Skin were prickt with Nettles. 
Some grow bald on their Head, 
others beardless and browless. 
They are oft troubled with lassitude, 
or sore Limbs, (especially 
at waking from sleep,) and a 
bloated Face, or sometimes a 
shrunck Visage; their Eys looking 
one time hollow, other times 
swell'd. 
 
18. The signs of a Mid-way 
Pox are a strange changeable 
soreness of the Gums, sometimes 
feeling loose, as if the Teeth 
[^p.54^] 
would fall out, other times 
bound or pincht; an itching, red, 
yellow, or blewish swelling of 
the Gums, a walking or twingeing 
Jaw-ach, and Chin-ach; a 
pain of the Head a little above 
the Nape of the Neck, a swiming 
of the Brain, a continual tinning 
noise in the ears, aptness to 
be deaf and hard of hearing; 
sharp defluxions into the throat, 
(whence proceed those Pocky 
hoarsnesses, and loss of the Palat) 
Nose, and other parts; a filthy 
dand_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]f of the Head, Beard, and 
Brows, a yellow or blewish circle 
about the Eyes; thinness of 
the upper and under Eye-lids; 
swellings and botches of all colours; 
rotten or straining cough; 
a hot belching of the Stomach; 
a rotten, stinking breath, stinking 
sweats in the Night; a drabby 
white Urin, with few or no 
[^p.55^] 
contents; quick, low, soft, Pulses. 
Their blood after bleeding 
looks blewish, or like Ashes. 
Heats rising from the Loins to 
the Stomach, Brest, Shoulders, up 
the Head; aptness to be Feaverish 
every day; some grow very 
lean with the Pox, others grow 
fat with it, but their fat is yellowish, 
greenish, or waterish; 
their looks are very changeable, 
sometimes for a day, three or 
four, they will look very well, 
afterwards again they look with 
an unwholsom colour, it may be 
yellow, greenish, blewish, or 
swarthy; Ulcers that are foul, 
hard, and c_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]llous, or overcrusted 
with a blackish scurf, the flesh 
being raw and deep red. Walking 
pains between the Joints; 
deep, hard fissures in the Plants 
of the Feet, Palms of the Hands, 
Te_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s, Fundament, Lips, and P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]erygomata; 
[^p.56^] 
thick, sore, inflamed 
Lips, gleeting a thin sharp water, 
covered sometime with a black 
Skin, or thin limber scurf, that 
easily peels off; broad, dry uneven 
scabs; stragling about the body; 
outward crusty Ulcers of 
the Nose, and rotten eating Ulcers 
within it, a rottenness of the 
bones of the Nose; a malignant 
Polypus, or purpre piece of flesh 
growing within the Nose; malignant 
Fistula's or issues about 
the Eyes; Pocky painful Piles, 
malignant swellings and fistula's 
of the Fundament; eating Ulcers 
and inflamations of the Palat, 
and Almonds under the Ears, 
a Cancer'd creeping thrush, scabby 
Eye-lids, a malignant inflamation 
of the Eye, a bleer dimness 
of the Eyes, the Whites 
whereof oft turn yellow, reddish, 
or blewish, great ugly Warts about 
[^p.57^] 
the Hands, Lips, and Face; 
Tetters of the Face, Breast, Belly, 
and Privities. 
 
19. The signes [^ORIG. BLURRED^] T_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]o_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]om-Pox, 
are furious Night-pains in 
the Joints, fixt insufferable head-aches, 
gnawing worse in the 
Night; immoveable, bruising, 
retching, & pricking Shin-pains, 
shoulder and wrist pains; deep 
gnawing, devouring gangrenous 
Ulcers, and deep rottennesses of 
the Bones; inward Ulcers of the 
spleen, kidneys, bladder, and liver; 
a pocky Ptisick, or a pocky 
consumption and hectick Fever; 
a Pocky blindness, Tophes or 
hard knots about the Joints, 
nodes or bumps about the Head 
and Joints; gums or soft broad 
swellings of the bigness of an 
Egg, or sometimes of a penny 
Loaf, bursting out into a white 
glaw, others are flat hardnesses, as 
[^p.58^] 
those that grow to the Shins, 
Skull, and, Arm-bones. Imposthums 
of, [^ORIG. BLURRED^] _[ ORIG. BLURRED^]ds, &c. 
 
20. A _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]d gets the Pox ofttimes 
from a Pocky Nurse, by 
sucking her Breasts, and then it 
appears in eating scabs, and purple 
blains at the Lips, likewise 
small, red burning Pimples about 
the Lips, Ring-worms about the 
Chin, inflamations of the Lips 
and inside of the Mouth, a m_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]lignant 
fiery Thrush. 
 
21. The s_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]me signes appear, 
when a Man gets the Pox by kissing 
pocky Lips. The signs of a 
pocky Nurse, are creeping purple 
Pimples about the Nipple, 
with black spots upon 'em; the 
Nipple infl_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]mes, and is apt to be 
cloven. After all this take notice, 
that seldom or never all the signs 
do meet in one body, but only 
such as are agreeing with the 
[^p.59^] 
complexion; as those of a sanguin 
complexion, are troubled 
with red spots, pimples about 
their fore-head, and over their 
whole body; others of a phleg_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]tick 
constitution, with Night-p_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ins, 
and hard swellings. Pocky 
Ulcers commonly attend cholerick 
Bodies. Some again are 
mark'd with a great number of 
signs, others with two or three 
only. Lastly observe, that many 
of these fore-mentioned signs do 
accompany other Diseases, as 
Pimples, Ulcers, and Night-pains, 
wherefore I'le instruct you how 
to distinguish them. 1. If Pimples, 
Ulcers, or pains do appear 
after a Man hath had to do with 
a common Woman, it's very probable 
they are pocky. 2. If a 
Man be troubled with Pimples, 
Ulcers, or pains, upon a running 
of the Reins, swelling in the groin 
[^p.60^] 
or eating sore of the Yard, they 
are likewise pocky. 3. Pocky 
pimples generally have a black 
speck a top, which peels off like 
scurf. Pocky Night-pains are 
for the most part felt in the m_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]dle 
of a Limb, between the two 
Joints, deep in the flesh, and next 
to the bone. They begin to rage 
in the Evening, and cease in the 
Morning at Sun-rising. 
 
Women are troubled with the 
same symptoms Men are, viz. 
being clapt, their Urin is hot, 
pricking, and smarting, carries a 
strong stinck with it when it's 
made, and is full of whitish sands 
and darkish hairs; they more-over 
feel themselves so sore in 
those parts, that they cannot endure 
the least touch without a 
wry face. They are likewise oft 
troubled with a running of the 
Reins, in every particular resembling 
[^p.61^] 
that in men, which they 
oft find themselves mistaken in, 
judging it another accident, 
which they term the Whites. 
They are likewise subject to Buboes, 
Sha_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ckers, Cordees of the 
Clitoris, Wharts, Pastles, Ulcers, 
and Night-pains. 
 
[^p.62^] 
[}ART. VII. 
 
A true Chronology of the P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x.}] 
 
22. THe Pox at it_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] first birth 
in the Camp at N_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]pl_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], 
was far rougher than now it is; 
for then where it seised, it instantly 
lamed the Patient in all 
his limbs, dozed his intellectuals, 
and cast him into a continual 
sleeping posture, frights, fears, 
melancholly, and an estranged 
countenance. Oft times they 
were surprised with an eating 
Shancker, which in a day or two 
at most would eat off the whole 
Yard; soon after their eyes, nose, 
lips, and Palat of the Mouth, 
would be rotted off, whereupon 
followed a hoarsness, some 
spoke whis_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ering, others quite 
lost their speech, and all their 
[^p.63^] 
Teeth, after this they would 
break out into cancerous eating 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] or sores, all their Bodies 
over, that would rot the bone in 
few hours, more-over they were 
wrackt with most raging Headaches, 
and pains about their 
bones, that never suffer'd them 
to sleep, but slumber, and then 
they were apt to be frighted with 
most horrid dreams and visions; 
their sweat stunck at a great distance, 
all which in few days 
guided the Patient to his Tomb. 
This fary the Pox continued for 
Thirty y_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rs, and then grew 
somewhat milder, not rotting 
the Eyes, Nose, nor Teeth; decreased 
in pimples, and appeared 
most in gums and pains. Some 
Thirty Years after that, the Pox 
did not show it self in any pimples, 
but decreased in pains, Ulcers, 
and Tumors. Thirty Years 
[^p.64^] 
after that again, the Pox appeared 
with four new symptoms; the 
first was a shedding of the [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
of the Head, Brows, Eye-li_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s, 
and Beard. The second new commer 
was a running of the Reins. 
The third was the loss of the 
Nails; and the fourth a tinning 
noise in the Ears. About this 
time the Eyes and the Teeth began 
to suffer again. In what particulars 
its changed since, you 
may easily gather from the foregoing 
Discourse. 
 
[^p.65^] 
[}ART. VIII. 
 
Comprising the Prognosticks 
of the P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x.}] 
 
23. What state and danger 
misfortuned Patients 
are placed in, ought to be set 
down next: a Venereal scalding 
of the Urin if neglected, changes 
into an excoriation of the Urethra, 
thence unto eating Ulcers, 
which oft devour great pieces 
of flesh, and bore holes quite 
through, through which the Urin 
oft passes, as they make it. 
Those sores or Ulcers afterwards 
tend to incurable Fistules, or else 
grow out into proud flesh, thence 
called a Caruncle, which immediately 
causeth a stoppage of Urin, 
a symptom of very dangerous 
importance. A Venereal 
[^p.66^] 
scalding of the Urin and a dribbling, 
otherwise called a Strangury, 
do oft through their neighbourhood 
turn into an Ulcer of 
the Bladder, which for the most 
part proves incurable, if in the 
membranous part; though in the 
fleshy part admits sometimes of 
a difficult cure. A Shanck_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]r if 
neglected, threats to devour the 
whole Member. A Shancker not 
being exquisitely cured, turns 
into a callosity, which afterwards 
proves of a very difficult 
cure. These callosities sometimes 
appear in the shape of a 
hard pustle; othertimes grow 
flat and are subject to vary in colour. 
A [^ORIG. BLURRED^] returning into 
the Body, foretels a Pox; if 
hard and diffi_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]lt to ripen signifies 
a strong infection. A Running 
of the Reins after _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ight 
Months proves obstinate. A second 
[^p.67^] 
G_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]norrhee upon a former, 
though cured, is oft of a worse 
consequence than a single Frontier 
Pox without a Gonorrhee. A 
third Gonorrhee after a tedious 
Cure sometimes leaves an incurable 
gleeting behind it. A Gonorrhee 
issuing immediately in a 
yellow or greenish matter, is instantly 
attended with a Cordee, 
and foretels a long cure. A Gonorrhe_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
that did not burst out before 
ten, fifteen, or twenty days, 
after the infection, proves to be 
of a difficult cure. A yellowish 
Ghunorrhee upon amendment 
turns white and thick, thence 
white and thin. A Gonorrhee thats 
stopt by adstringent medicines 
immediatly b_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rsts out into joint 
pains, Bub_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]es, or inflamations 
of the Cods. A Ghonorrhee grows 
much worse upon frequent converses 
[^p.68^] 
with Wenches before a 
Cure. Some inveterated G_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rrhees 
are absolutely incurable, 
since proceeding from a total 
devoration and corrosion of 
the Prostats, whence necessarily 
the Sperm must continually 
distil down as fast as it's conveyed 
through the Vasa deferentia, 
not being retained by the Prostats. 
A necessary consequence 
of this accident is a Consumptio 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]salis, and can be no otherwise 
prevented than by erecting 
the testicles. Sometimes a G_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]norrhee 
will stop of it self, and 
then commonly bursts out again 
more violently, it may be a 
Month after, and sometimes 
eight, ten, or twelve months 
after; as I have observed in several, 
without the least renewing of 
their accident: The same happens 
now and then if a Gonorrhee 
[^p.69^] 
be stopt by adstringents. I 
have known the cure of an ordinary 
virulent Gonorrhee continued 
a whole year together, and 
that with as much exactness 
as experience and the Rules of 
Art could prescribe, though to 
little purpose; Which notwithstanding 
I have cured by frequent 
bleedings, two or three 
Bol_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sses of Cassia and Manna, 
with a Decoction of Mallows 
and Plantain, and the addition 
of the mucillage of Gum Arabick. 
So that you are to suppose 
that the virulency was extinguisht 
by the former cure; 
and the flux of acrimonious 
and torrid humours diverted by 
the bleedings and purges; and 
the Acrimony obtused by the 
Decoction, whereupon the spermatick 
parts soon recovered their 
former temperament, together 
[^p.70^] 
with their retentive faculty. 
A Confirmed Pox succeeding 
a pustulous French Pox, proves 
of an easie Cure. A Pox upon 
a Bubo that's hard, or is 
struck inwards, turns to a Night 
Head-ach, Nades, Gums, and Ulcers 
of the Palat, and stoops to 
no slight Cure; a Pox upon a 
Running of the Reins turns to 
Pustles, and stragling Ulcers, and 
is easier Cured than the former; 
upon a scalding of the Urin it 
turns to some few pustuls of an 
easie Cure; upon a Shancker, 
changes into Nocturnal Nightpains, 
and those stubborn. In 
general, a Liminary Pox, as a 
Gonorrhee, Shancker, &c. are 
easily Cured. A Frontier, and 
a Mid-way Pox being chronical 
are of an indifferent submission 
to remedies; but a Thor_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] Pox 
is incurable. A Maiden Pox 
[^p.71^] 
promises an easie Cure, but a relapst 
Pox, or a Pox upon a former 
Pox is difficult. Rough venereal 
pains, or Gums, Tophes, 
or gnawing Ulcers without the 
fore-going or attendance of Pustles, 
threaten more mischief, than 
if they were attended with them. 
Joint-pains without Ulcers, or 
malign Ulcers without pains increase 
the evil. Malignant symptoms, 
as many devouring sores, 
furious pains, Tophes, Gums, 
Nodes, rottenness of the Nose, a 
devoured Palat, &c. argue an ill 
business; and so the case differs, 
according to the fierceness of 
symptoms, the age of the Disease, 
strength and temperament 
of the Patient. The breaking out 
of many red Pustles, not painful, 
and, easily ripening, likewise 
soft tumors require no tedious 
Cure. 
 
[^p.72^] 
The Pox of it self kils no man, 
but after a long travail fixes at 
last upon one symptom, as a 
Pocky hectick, Ulcer of the Kidney 
or Bladder, Consumption of 
the Lungs, Meagrim, Node, Tophe, 
Dropsie, Night-pains, &c. 
Which seldom leave the Patient 
on this side the grave. A Tinning 
within the Ears, deafness, blindness, 
and loss of speech are unrecoverable. 
Boys or Girls as they 
are more exposed to infection, 
so their Cure is easier. Old folks 
are in less danger of a blast, but 
once stormed by an infection, 
seldom or never are rescued. A 
Man is easier infected, and easier 
cured than a Woman. An Hereditary 
Pox is more refractory, 
than an infection by drinking, 
kissing, or sucking, and that's 
worse than an infection by copulation. 
Pocky hecticks, Dropsies, 
[^p.73^] 
Gouts, are much easier mollified, 
than if occasioned by other 
causes. Lastly, any sort of 
Pox, unless it be dextrously cured, 
is apt to leave an incurable 
Scurvy behind it. 
 
[}ART. IX. 
 
Containing some nice Questions relating 
to venereal Infection.}] 
 
24. IN what part of the Body is 
the principal Seat of Pocky 
Infection? 
 
A. In the Spleen certainly, 
that consisting of a thick course 
substance, and a strong sharp ferment, 
seems the more disposed to 
engender such salin armoniack 
steems, that cause the Pox. 
 
25. Why are the outward parts 
being remote, more liable to P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ckie 
Ulcers, pains, and tumors, than 
[^p.74^] 
the Entrails, as the Liver, 
Spleen, &c. which are proclaimed 
by m_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]st Authors to be harths, or 
springs of Pockie steems, and yet 
themselves remain free for a long 
time from those Pockie accidents? 
 
A. Because the Pox first seising 
the Body from without, doth 
the easier injure the outward 
parts, being weaker than the inward 
ones, which are furnisht 
with strong spirits to keep out 
the Infection. 
 
26. What part is apt to receive 
the strongest Infection? 
 
A. The secret parts, which 
consisting of a loose, open, thin 
flesh, do easily admit infectious 
steems. 
 
27. How many ways doth the 
Pox distribute its Infection? 
 
A. By kissing, fucking, lying 
in the same Bed, and copulation; 
[^p.75^] 
that is thus, if ones Mouth, or 
Breast be set with pocky pimples, 
or Ulcers, then they are capable 
of infecting, but not if 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ound though the Body were never 
so Pocky in the other parts. 
 
28. To what distance is the Pox 
infectious? 
 
A. As far as the Pocky steems 
can be transmitted hot, which at 
farthest is not above a Hand 
bredth or two. 
 
29. Two, three, or more, successively 
mounting a pocky Saddle, 
why should sometimes the first 
alone come off galled, or why other-times 
the second only, and 
the rest come off clear? 
 
A. Because in some Women 
of a cold complexion the venom 
lies deep, and therefore the first 
not heating his Whore enough 
to extract the venom, comes off 
clear, leaving the second to keep 
[^p.76^] 
the Iron hot, who carries away 
the pocky prize. But if the pocky 
Wench be of a hot complexion, 
then the first is only in danger of 
a blast, leaving her in a colder 
temper to deal with his comrads, 
who therefore come off without 
any dammage. 
 
30. When i_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]'t, that a Man 
disgraced with an inveterate Pox, 
his Wife is nevertheless guarded 
from the Infection? 
 
A. It's possible for a Man to 
have had the Pox in his lower 
parts, and be cured of it, though 
notwithstunding may have a relick 
in other parts of his body, 
and therefore may converse with 
his Wife without doing her the 
least wrong. 
 
31. Whether is Man-kind only 
subject to this Pockie infection? 
 
A. The Disease is also common 
to Dogs; for my self have 
[^p.77^] 
seen a little Curr in Holland, that 
had a virulent Running of the 
Reins, with several crusty Ulcers 
upon his body. Likewise in It_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
many refrain eating Turkeys 
because a great number of 'em 
are infected with the Pox. 
 
32. Whether a Man that's 
troubled with a venereal Running 
of the Reins, doth not render his 
accident worse, by conversing with 
comm_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n W_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]men? 
 
A. Doubtless he must, for 
heating himself in so high a degree, 
and thereby opening the 
pores, must necessarily let in the 
venom deeper into his body. 
 
33. Whether a Wom_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n tyed to 
a P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]k_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e Husband, can escape the 
Infection her self, and yet give it 
to another? 
 
A. It's possible, and it hath 
happened, though it be a chance 
among a million. 
 
[^p.78^] 
34. Whether over-frequent embraces 
between a married couple 
can produce the least spice of the 
P_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]x? 
 
A. It's vulgarly believed it 
may, many having contracted a 
yellow or greenish Running of 
the Reins, by being too liberal 
to their Wives; but this is a clear 
mistake, the foresaid running being 
in no wise virulent; neither 
is't possible it can ever grow 
such, being only occasioned by 
weakning the spermatick Vissels, 
and thereby disposed to receive 
sharp humors, that cause the foresaid 
running by irritation. 
 
35. Whether one that's clapt, 
doth diminish his infection by conversing 
with a sound Curtiz_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n? 
 
A. On the contrary, he rather 
increases his accident; the 
reason extract out of Par. 30. 
 
36. Whether it be p_[^ORIG. BLANK^]ssible for a 
[^p.79^] 
Man to enjoy his health perfectly, 
so as to eat, drink, and sleep well, 
and yet carry a hidden Pox about 
him? 
 
A. It's common for Men to 
look better, and have a sharper 
appetite than ever, for six, eight, 
t_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], & somtimes twelve months, 
yet walk about with a green 
virulent Gonorrhee, that being instead 
of an issue, serving to evacuate 
and drain all the superfluous 
humours of the body, 
whereby the complexion must 
needs for a time be render'd 
clearer, and the appetite edged. 
2 l_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]. I have known some, that 
vaunted to have run the greatest 
Pocky hazards imaginable, without 
perceiving the least hurt for 
some Years, who notwithstanding 
after so long a time of perfect 
health, have unexpectly sneezed 
several small pieces of bone 
[^p.80^] 
out at their Nose, being parts of 
the Os Ethm_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]eldes, or Crista 
galli, that was insensibly cariated 
or rotted by subtil pocky steems 
flying up to the head. 3. About 
a twelve-month since, I cured a 
Gentleman, that had a most violent 
pain on one small part of the 
Bregma, excurring no farther 
than the bredth of a six-pence, 
being that kind of Head-ach, 
which Physicians usually call 
Clavus, a species of a Cephalæa; 
though Galen, as I remember, 
lib de occul. terms Clavus a disease 
of the eye. This torturing head-ach 
my Patient had patiently endured 
for three Months without 
having received the least benefit 
from any Physician, he had applyed 
himself unto; But at last 
fortune having conducted him to 
me, did make a narrow search, 
and found a small rising on his 
[^p.81^] 
head, not unlike a Node, wh_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]reupon 
I strictly enquired, whether 
he had not lately, or within a 
Year or two, conversed with 
some suspicious Woman; he answered, 
that about four Years ago 
he had contracted a Running 
of the Reins, but had been so 
well cured of it, that from that 
time until the arrival of this pain, 
he had possest his health better 
than ever. In short, having caused 
my Chyrurgeon to open the part 
affected with a potential cautery, 
found the Cranium cariated, 
ruggid and blackish, which having 
ordered to be plained with 
a Scalprum, cured him with my 
Antivenereal. Whence it appears 
he carried this hidden Pox almost 
four years about him. 4. I have 
had several Women patients, that 
had cherished a hidden Pox for 
five or six Years, without discovering 
[^p.82^] 
any sensible Disease all 
that time.
