[}A 
TREATISE OF THE 
Disease of the GOVT. The 
severall sorts thereof, &c.}] 
 
THE word (GOVT) hath two significations. 
[/1./] 
The one generall; the other 
particular. Generally, all such aches as 
are incident to any joynt, wee call the 
Gout; whereas in nature and deed they 
differ not; but only in respect of the 
part affected: and in respect thereof, they are distinguished 
in name. As the ach in the fingers is called 
Chiragra; the ach in the knees is called Gonagra; 
the ach in the hip is called Sciatica; in the ankles 
(some terme) Talia Talaria; and the ach in all the 
joynts is called Arthritis, i. morbus articularis; which 
is the generall name to all aches and greifes of the 
joynts. Particularly the word Gout is taken for the 
paine and griefe only of the feet, and from thence it 
assumeth a name distinct from the rest, Podagra, quasi 
pedum captura vel agritudo, the disease of the feet, 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], sive [^GREEK OMITTED^] It hath also two other significations, 
[/2./] 
the one proper, the other common. Properly 
the Gout is taken for a grievous paine in the 
[^p.2^] 
joynts of the feet, proceeding either of some distemperature 
in the part affected, or of some humor bred 
in the part by the weaknesse or ill disposition thereof, 
or by the deflux of some humor descending from some 
other upper place unto that part. In the common signification 
all other aches proceeding of what cause 
soever may bee called the Gout: such as come by contusion 
or brusing, or by dislocation of a joynt: and so 
[/3./] 
the French disease having an untolerable ach in the 
limmes, like a false fellow, being ashamed of his owne 
name, termeth it selfe sometimes by the name of Ach 
or Gout. In this slender Discourse of the Gout, I will 
[/4./] 
entreat of that which is particularly appropriate unto 
the feet, and properly is called the Gout. In the explication 
whereof, I will first declare what the Gout is: 
[/5./] 
Next what are the causes thereof. Thirdly, by what 
signes each cause is to be knowne. Fourthly, whether 
it may be cured or no. Fiftly, what kinde of cure belongeth 
unto it. And lastly, how a man may bee preserved 
from it. 
 
[/6./] 
Concerning the first. The Gout is a griefe of the 
feet, occasioned by some distemperature, or irregular 
humor, which either is bred in the joynts of the feet, 
and toes, by some weaknesse thereof, or by deflux hath 
descended from some upper part thereunto. That the 
nature of the Gout may the better appeare, I will verbatim 
expound this definition. First it is a griefe or 
paine. A griefe (as concerning this purpose) is occasioned 
[/7./] 
after foure sorts: Either by way of oppressing a 
part, when as a grosse humor weighing downe a part 
ponderously, causeth it to greeve in bearing the burden 
thereof: such kinde of griefe proceedeth of a 
phlegmatick, and melancholick humor, because they 
[^p.3^] 
are heavy and weighty. Another kinde of griefe commeth 
by way of distention, when as the veines, and sinewes, 
and arteries of some one part are fuller than 
they should be, then is that part greeved by distention. 
This kinde of griefe commeth sometimes of winde, and 
sometimes of fulnesse of blood, and of humors. Another 
kinde of greife proceedeth of a distemperature of 
a part, as when it is colder or hotter than it should be, 
because each part doth rejoyce in its naturall state, and 
an unnaturall is greevous unto it: such kinde of greefe 
commeth of inflammations. The fourth kinde of 
greefe is by way of erosion, when as the part affected 
doth feele a greevous gnawing and fretting; which 
kinde of greife commeth either of a cholerick humor, 
or else of a corruption and depravation of other humors. 
Now to apply: The Gout is a greife in some by 
[/8./] 
way of oppressing the part; when as it commeth of a 
cold humor, and this kinde is incident most to old 
men, who abound in cold humors, by reason of the 
decay of naturall heat. Also the Gout is a greife in 
some by way of distention, whereas the body being 
replete with abundance of humors, the upper and 
stronger parts put downe their offending fulnesse unto 
the lower, which descending, the veines, and sinewes, 
and arteries procure this paine of distention. 
This kinde of greife is incident to men of middle age, 
and such as are of a sanguine complexion, and do use a 
full diet, with little exercise and much rest. Thirdly, 
the Gout is a greife in some by way of distemperature, 
and this doth fall out as occasion is offered, as some by 
standing long in cold water, may have the Gout by 
reason of a cold distemperature, which is wrought into 
the part by the cold water. And some by much travell 
[^p.4^] 
on foot in hot weather may have the Gout by reason 
of a hot distemperature procured unto the feet by 
overmuch travell and heat. Lastly, in some the Gout 
is a greife by way of corrosion, not that it eateth the 
flesh, but in that it gnaweth and fretteth, that the patient 
somtimes thinketh that dogs do gnaw his bones. 
This kinde befalleth cholerick persons, and such as use 
an ill diet, breeding in them store of ill humors. So is 
it evident that the Gout is a greife, and what kinde of 
greife, which is profitable to him that will give help 
thereunto, for by the manner of the greife wee come 
unto the cause thereof, and so accordingly apply the 
remedy. It followeth that it is a greife of the feet. 
[/9./] 
There are foure reasons why the feet are more afflicted 
with these greifes than other parts are. First in respect 
of their place, for that they are the lowest parts in the 
body, the upper put downe their superfluities to them, 
where they remayning, procure in some one manner 
or other (as is before specified) a paine. The second 
cause is, for that the feet are not of so compact or solid 
substance as some other parts are of, but have a thinne 
composition, with many void and empty receptacles, 
and therefore in more abundant sort do receive and reteine 
the superfluities of other parts. The third cause 
is, for that the feet are more in motion than other parts, 
and the nature of motion is, to make attraction of humors 
unto the moved part, and consequently a paine. 
The fourth is a debility naturally incident more to the 
feet than unto other parts; for that they are situate farthest 
from the fountaine of heat, which is the heart. 
They also consist of such substance as is of a cold complexion; 
so that both for lack of the comfort they 
should have from the heat of the heart, as also in respect 
[^p.5^] 
of their owne composition, the feet are weaker 
than the other parts, and the weaker goeth still to the 
wall: for they receive the annoyances of the stronger, 
because they are not of strength to resist: and therefore 
must of necessity yeeld to their paine. Now why 
[/10./] 
in the Gout the feet should feele such greevous paine, 
this is the reason; for that they consist of many joynts, 
and have for their motion and sense many nerves, 
which are the instruments of motion and sense; whatsoever 
part is most neruous, is also most sensible: and 
therefore the feet upon any little offence, are pained or 
greeved the more. Another reason is this, that about 
every joynt is wrapped a skinne, and when as a humor 
hath insinuated it selfe betweene that and the joynt, in 
distending of that, untill it bee resolved, it worketh an 
intolerable greife; and it is so hard to resolve it, as that 
sometimes it doth indurate or grow into an hard substance, 
which is called nodosa Podagra, the knotted 
Gout. And these two causes of the dolorous state of 
the feet, are accidentally growing from the part it selfe 
affected. In respect of other causes I have given other 
reasons before in the fourefold distinction of greifes. 
Now it doth follow that this greife in the feet is occasioned 
by some distemperature. There are eight sorts 
[/11./] 
of distemperatures; foure simple, and foure compound. 
The foure simple are, too hot, too cold, too moist, too 
dry. The foure compound, too hot and dry withall; 
too moist and cold withall; too hot and moist; too 
dry and cold withall. And these inequalities come by 
[/12./] 
reason of some unequall mixture of the foure elements 
in us, and the dominion of some one or other above 
the rest. The foure elements whereof wee are compounded 
[/13./] 
are, the fire, the ayre, the water, the earth: 
[^p.6^] 
the element of fire is hot and dry, the ayre hot and 
moist, the water cold and moist, the earth cold and 
dry. Of these foure mixed together come the foure 
[/14./] 
temperaments or complexions. The cholerick hot 
and dry, where the fire hath the dominion: the sanguine 
hot and moist, wherein wherein the ayre hath 
the dominion: the phlegmatick cold and moist, wherein 
the water hath the dominion: the melancholick, 
wherein the element of earth is predominant; and of 
[/15./] 
these foure temperaments come the foure humors, to 
wit, choler, hot and dry; blood, hot and moist; phlegm, 
cold and moist; melancholy, cold and dry. Of these 
foure humors are framed and maintained all the parts 
of mans body, so that if they offend either in the first 
[/16./] 
composition in any inequality, or after, by disorder of 
diet be made unequall, then do they breed either in the 
whole, or in some part, the like inequality. And hence 
it commeth that we have hot and dry diseases, as Fevers: 
and we have cold and moist diseases, as the Palsey, 
Apoplexie, the falling sicknesse, and divers moe: 
also we have diseases of the blood, as inflammations: 
and likewise of melancholy. Which all diseases, as 
some in some one part, and some in some other, may 
come of the distemperature of the same part, so the Gout 
may also come of a distemperature in the feet, either 
bred therein originally, or by some disorder procured 
unto them, as hereafter in the causes which procure 
the Gout shall appeare. It followeth, that it is occasioned 
eyther by some distemperature, or irregular humor. 
[/17./] 
The humors of the body are either good and 
naturall, and then nature rejoyceth in them, for that 
they nourish the body, and maintaine it in good health 
and long life. Or else they are naught and contrary 
[^p.7^] 
to nature, for that they procure diseases and destruction 
unto it, as when they are possessed with putrifaction. 
Or else they are neither good altogether, neither 
bad, but semimali, halfe naught, and this state of the 
humors I call irregular, because they are not altogether 
over-ruled by nature, and that in three respects: 
[/18./] 
for either they offend in quantity, in being in greater abundance 
than the nature of the body requireth: or 
they offend in quality, being too hot, or too cold, or 
too sharp, and rodent: or else they offend in substance, 
when as they are declining somewhat from a good and 
naturall state unto an unnaturall. There are three sorts 
[/19./] 
of bodies considered in physick, the body healthfull, 
the body diseased, and thirdly the body neither perfectly 
whole, neither diseased, but in a neutrality between 
both: which is after two sorts, either when a 
sick body recovereth and groweth toward health; then 
it is neither whole nor sick: or when a whole body is 
declining from a healthfull state and groweth to bee 
sick. By the [/20./] first sort of humors, the first kinde of bodies 
is maintained: and by the [/21./] second the second kinde 
of bodies is corrupted: and by the [/22./] third kinde the 
third sort of bodies are molested. Now for the Gout, 
[/23./] 
it cannot come of good humors, for that they bring 
no paine to the body, but comfort. And of the second 
sort it cannot proceed, for then there should alwayes 
a bad fever go with the Gout, for that such humors 
have alwaies in them a putrifaction. Wherefore it remaineth, 
it come of the third sort, either through 
their overgreat quantity, or ill-disposed quality, or 
some depravation of substance: and these are the humors 
which I call irregular, for that they are not obedient 
to nature, and yet not altogether repugnant to 
[^p.8^] 
nature, but by some slender meanes may bee corrected 
and reclaimed unto a good and naturall state. It followeth 
that these humors are either bred in the feet, or 
by a deflux descend thereinto from some upper part. 
When ill humors breed in a part, it is through an imbecility 
and weaknesse of that part. The strength of 
[/24./] 
all parts consisteth in a naturall heat, grounded and setled 
naturally in that part, by vertue whereof there is 
drawn to the part a competent food to maintaine it, 
and by it that food is concocted and converted into a 
profitable nutriture for the same part, retaining that 
which is good, and expelling that which is excrementitious 
and nought. Now when this naturall heat by 
any sinister meanes is infirmed and weakned, then do 
the functions of that part faile in their duty; for neither 
can there bee good concoction in the part as 
should be, neither sufficient expulsion of the superfluities 
left of that concoction in the part, as should bee. 
[/25./] 
Wherefore three inconveniences follow through this 
infirmity of naturall heat. First, good and profitable 
matter is not bred in the part so affected. And the bad 
is not expulsed. And thirdly, the part is made a sinke 
to receive the drosse of other parts. Now if by some 
[/26./] 
meanes an imbecillity happen to the feet, that neither 
they breed for themselves a profitable nutriture, and 
yet cannot expell that which is unprofitable, it must 
needs follow, that in keeping thereof, they cannot bee 
well, but ill affected. This is to shew, that the matter 
of the Gout may be bred in the feet through the weake 
state and condition of naturall heat, appertaining unto 
them, whereupon doth grow humorum decubitus, (as 
we terme it) that is, when for lack of good concoction 
in any part, ill humors by little and little are laid up in 
[^p.9^] 
that part, which after some season, either by their overgreat 
quantity, or ill affected quality, and by some 
depravation of their substance, prove offensive and 
hurtfull unto that part. It followeth now, how the 
[/27./] 
Gout may come by a deflux of some humor descending 
from some upper part into the feet: which is in two 
respects. For either it may proceed from the braine, 
or from other parts in the podagricall body. The deflux 
of an humor from the braine is called a rheume, 
[/28./] 
which is the mother of many diseases. For somtimes 
it taketh course to the eyes, and thereof commeth a 
dropping and inflammation of the eyes, and a dimnesse 
and losse of sight; somtimes it taketh course by 
the nose, and is called the pose; sometimes to the 
mouth, and causeth great expuition, and spitting, and 
the falling of the uvula, and toothach; somtimes to the 
windpipe, and therof commeth raucedo, the hoarsnes; 
somtimes to the lungs, and causeth exulceration or putrifaction 
thereof, or some great obstruction, which 
bringeth a difficulty of breathing and strangulation; 
sometimes it taketh course to the stomach, and causeth 
lack of appetite and ill digestion; and if to the guts, 
then falleth out the flux of the belly called a lask; somtime 
it setleth in the braine, and groweth into a grosse 
and thick substance, either in the sore part, as in the 
nerves optick, which are the conducts whereby the 
power of seeing doth come unto the eyes, and causeth 
either dimnesse, or losse of sight; or in the conducts 
that convey the power of hearing unto the eares, and 
there causeth a dulnesse of hearing or deafnesse; or in 
the conducts that convey the power of smelling to the 
nose, and cause either a lack or losse of swelling; or in 
the conducts that come to the tongue, and these doth 
[^p.10^] 
occasion the like imperfection in tasting: Also if it settle 
in the fore part, obstructing the cels or ventricles of 
the braines, three ill diseases do grow thereupon, called 
three of the dead sleepes, caros, & coma, & apoplexia. 
Also in the fore part it causeth a hurt to imagination. 
The middle part of the head is the seat of understanding 
and reason, where if this grosse rheumatick matter 
do settle, is causeth stultitia, foolishnesse. In the hinder 
part it causeth the lethargy, another of the dead 
sleepes, and the palsey, and the falling sicknesse, and 
the convulsion, and oblivion or losse of memory. And 
if it come down backward into the neck, it causeth a 
kinde of convulsion called tetanos, when as the neck 
cannot turne to nor fro, but it standeth stiffe and stark 
without motion. If it flow downe to the back, it causeth 
another kinde of convulsion called opisthotonos, 
wherein the head and the heeles are made to meet backward. 
If it flow forward into the muscles of the breast, 
another convulsion is caused called emprosthotonos, 
wherein the head and the feet are drawn together forward. 
Now if it go to the joynts, it is morbus articularis; 
if to the hands and fingers, it is chiragra; if to 
[/29./] 
the knees, it is gonagra; if to the feet and toes, it is podagra, 
the Gout. And the reason why the rheume 
should occasion all these diseases is this. The braine is 
the fountaine of nerves, principium nervorum, and in 
the braine are made animall spirits, which do give the 
power of moving and feeling, and are conveyed by 
those nerves into every part of the body; so that when 
the braine is affected in rheumatick sort, partly by 
them, and partly by other meatus, as it were passages, 
the inferiour parts shall feele the effects of this ill disposition 
of the braine. And between the head and the 
[^p.11^] 
feet there is a great consent, by reason of many and 
great nerves and veines extended directly from the one 
to the other, so that many shall bee ill affected in their 
head by taking cold in their feet. This deflux also 
[/30./] 
which is in cause of the Gout, may proceed from other 
places, as the liver, and therefore in every deflux there 
are foure points to bee considered. The first is the 
mandant from whence it proceedeth. The second the 
matter that floweth. The third the passages whereby 
the matter descendeth. The fourth is the part recipient, 
wherein this matter setleth it selfe. Now when 
[/31./] 
we are to deale with a disease that dependeth upon a 
deflux, wee must find out from whence it proceedeth, 
what it is, and by what wayes it descendeth, so wee 
shall the better finde a releefe to the part whereunto it 
descendeth. And so to conclude this point, the Gout 
[/32./] 
is a paine of the feet, depending upon some distemperature 
of the part, or of some irregular humor; either 
bred in the part by imbecility thereof, or derived from 
some other part, and that principally the braine; 
which definition how it is to bee understood, I have 
for better declaration sake, verbatim expounded, so 
that this may suffice for the first point, to wit, what the 
Gout is. 
 
The second point conteineth the causes. The causes 
[/33./] 
of the Gout are partly externall, and partly internall. 
The externall are [/34./] first too moist a state of the aire, 
for that doth engender great store of rheum. [/35./] Also the 
use of many sorts of meats, and too great ingurgitation 
thereof, for that doth heape up great store of humors, 
which one way or other must have a vent. [/36./] Also ill 
digestion, for that doth engender ill humors. [/37./] Also the 
often use of strong wines, especially fasting, because 
[^p.12^] 
they do send up many vapors unto the braine, and fill 
it full of rheumatick matter, and do withall procure 
weaknesse to the nerves and sinewes, whereupon must 
needs follow, that nothing can bee worse for the Gout, 
[/38./] 
than to be often drunken. The immoderate use of Venery 
is wonderfull ill, for that it spendeth the spirits, 
and decayeth naturall heat, and so procureth a weaknesse 
[/39./] 
to all parts of the body. Also the Gout may come 
of overmuch sleepe, especially in the afternoone, and 
that immediatly after meat, for that doth fill the brain 
[/40./] 
full of rheumatick matter. Also overmuch watching, 
and fasting, and study, and labour, and sorrow, and 
care, because they spend the body, and cause a weaknesse 
in the parts thereof, may occasion the Gout. It 
[/41./] 
may come also of too much rest and ease, for that such 
superfluities are retained in the body as should bee discussed 
by exercise. Also much walking and travell on 
[/42./] 
foot, because it draweth a deflux to the feet, may procure 
[/43./] 
the Gout. Also the use of cold and moist meats, 
as Cucumbers, Gourds, Lettuce, Endive, and such 
[/44./] 
like. Also it may come when any usuall evacuation 
is stopped, for then the matter wanting an usuall vent, 
[/45./] 
will flow into other parts of the body. And because 
exercise doth evacuate by sweat, much superfluous and 
excrementitious matter, the omission or long intermission 
of any accustomed exercise may be an occasion 
[/46./] 
of the Gout. Also too much cold in the feet, because it 
[/47./] 
dulleth the naturall heat of the part. And too hot keeping 
of the feet, because it resolveth forth the naturall 
heat of the part, and so weakneth the feet, may procure 
[/48./] 
the Gout. Sometimes the Gout commeth by inheritance. 
The reason whereof is this. The seed whereof 
conception is made, is taken principally from the 
[^p.13^] 
principall parts. For the liver giveth the blood whereof 
it is made, the heart giveth the vitall spirit, whereby 
it receiveth life, the braine giveth the animall spirit, 
whereby it receiveth motion and sense; and secondarily 
it is taken from all parts of the body, so that if any 
imperfection be in any one part of the parents, the inconvenience 
thereof often befalleth the child. These 
and such like may bee the causes of the Gout externall, 
and they are to be found out by the inquisition of the 
Physitian, and relation of the patient. All which do 
not one way procure the Gout, but some by breeding 
the matter thereof, some by procuring the deflux of 
the matter, some by weakning the joynts, making them 
subject to the deflux. Now to come to the internall 
[/49./] 
causes, they are either blood, or choler, or phlegme, or 
melancholy, and that simply some one, or moe mixed 
together. Blood is of all humors the best. First, for 
that it is the matter or substance, whereof the spirits are 
made, wherein doe consist all actions and functions 
either vitall, or animall, or naturall. Next, for that it is 
[/50./] 
that that doth nourish the body; for it is the treasure 
of nature, and the upholder and maintainer of life, 
and therefore Moses said, that anima omnis carnis est in 
sanguine, the life of all flesh is in the blood. This blood 
[/51./] 
is made after this sort: The food which we receive into 
our stomach is there converted into a white substance 
called chylus, which being put over into the 
guts, is from thence sucked out by certaine veines called 
vene mesaraice, which are dispersed all over the 
upper ones and bottome of the stomach, and by them 
is conveyed into a veine entring into the liver, called 
vena porta, and by that it goeth to the liver, wherein 
it is converted to blood by a peculiar property and faculty 
[^p.14^] 
[/52./] 
naturally given unto the liver. Wherefore blood 
is a humour hot and moist, made ex chylo, that is, a 
substance of food concocted in the stomach, being from 
thence and the guts, by certaine veines conveyed into 
[/53./] 
the liver. It is after two sorts, either good or bad: The 
good is knowne first by his substance, it is not too 
[/54./] 
thick, nor too thinne, but of an indifferent substance. 
Next by the colour, it is very red. Thirdly by the tast, 
it is sweet. Lastly by the smell, for it is of no ill savour 
[/55./] 
or sent. The bad is, when it declineth from these conditions, 
and that either in respect of it selfe, or of other 
humors mixed therewith. In respect of it selfe, it is 
sometimes not good, either for that the substance therof 
is thicker, or thinner than is convenient, or because 
it is adust or burnt blood, the thicker part wherof goeth 
into melancholy, and thinner into choler. By admistion 
with other humors it may bee made naught after 
sundry sorts, in respect of great variety of many other 
humors as may be mixed therewith. As being mixed 
with melancholy, it is made thick, and grosse, and 
black: being mixed with phlegm, it is made cold and 
whitish: with choler it is made thinne and pale, or 
yellowish, and hot, and fretting, and bitter. And being 
mixed with putrified humors, it is wholly corrupted 
in substance, in colour, in taste, and is of an ill savour. 
[/56./] 
This blood amongst the rest is one internall 
cause of the Gout, when as it is good, but in too great 
quantity, whereof I have given a reason before: but 
most of all when it is bad, either in it selfe, or by admistion 
with other humors: for being once made in the 
liver, it is put over into a great master veine, out of the 
which a great multitude of other veines, some big, some 
lesse, do ramifie, whereby this blood is conveyed into 
[^p.15^] 
all parts of the body, and such as it is, good or bad, so 
doth it affect the parts of the body, either in good sort, 
or in bad. The second internall cause of the Gout is 
[/57./] 
the humor phlegmatick, which is next unto blood, for 
that it is indeed a crude or inconcocted blood, and in 
time of hunger and hard fare it is by better concoction 
converted into a profitable blood for the maintenance 
of the body. And therefore next unto blood it is of all 
humors in greatest abundance in the body, and hath 
no proper place allotted unto it, but doth converse 
[/58./] 
with the blood in the veines, and that for three causes. 
The first is to make the blood more current in the 
veines, which of it selfe otherwise would be too thick. 
The second is, for that with the blood it should passe 
to such phlegmatick parts as are to be nourished therewith. 
The third, that it should go into the joynts for 
the suppling and moistning thereof, for they are compounded 
of dry substances, which without that kinde 
of suppling, would bee unapt to any ready motion: 
wherefore this humor may bee defined after this sort. 
That it is an humor in quality cold and moist, in substance 
[/59./] 
crude and inconcocted, in colour inclining to 
white, or either of no taste, or somewhat sweet, which 
being bred in the stomach, is from thence conveyed to 
the liver, and from thence by the veines with the 
blood, is distributed into all parts of the body. This 
[/60./] 
humor is either naturall or unnaturall: to the naturall 
belongeth that which is before. The unnaturall is made 
either in respect of it selfe, or by admistion of other 
humors. Of it selfe sometimes it is too thick, somtimes 
[/61./] 
too thin, sometimes roping like birdlime, sometimes 
like to molten glasse called vitrea pituita. There is also 
a phlegm which is sowre, which likewise is very crude; 
[^p.16^] 
another of no taste, which is not so crude; and another 
[/62./] 
is salt, and that in respect of it selfe. Now by admistion 
of other humors the like depravation ariseth, 
being mixed with choler it is salt, or being mixed with 
some putrified humor, it hath the like taste; and being 
mixed with melancholy, it is of a sowre taste. But in 
[/63./] 
all these sorts of phlegme wee must speake after two 
sorts: eyther properly, or improperly. Properly that 
is to be understood for the humor phlegmatick, which 
with the blood goeth into the veines. Improperly all 
the cold and grosse matter that commeth out of the 
braine, and out of the lungs, and stomach, is called 
[/64./] 
phlegme. Now for the Gout, it may come either of 
the humor it selfe, or being mixed with other humors. 
If it come of it selfe, then must it not be thick or grosse, 
for that is not apt for a deflux, but if must bee a thinne 
phlegme, which may be fluent, and this doth happen 
to old men and such as are of a cold constitution, which 
through weaknesse of naturall heat do breed it, and 
therefore in such wee shall often see towards night 
their legs to swell; for the humor being not good, the 
heart and stronger parts put it downe to the lower, 
where it doth settle and swell. But in yonger persons 
we shall seldome see the Gout to come of this humor 
alone, but being mixed with choler, which maketh it 
[/65./] 
more fluent, and more to afflict the patient. Wherefore 
now I will entreat of the third cause internall of 
the Gout, which is the humor cholerick. It it is to bee 
understood, that the food whereon wee feed, is not of 
one simple condition, and nature, and therefore is not 
in us converted into one only humor, but moe. And 
as in the liver this food is turned into blood, so in the 
same part is there a purification of the blood by separation 
[^p.17^] 
of other humors, and by taking of them to 
their proper places, wherefore with blood there are 
made in the liver both choler and melancholy, for the 
thinner part and hotter is turned into choler, and the 
thicker and grosser into melancholy. The choler is 
drawn from the blood by the gall, and the melancholy 
by the spleen, which two places are the receptacles 
[/66./] 
of these two humors. This cholerick humor as the 
former is either naturall or unnaturall: the naturall is 
an humor in quality hot and dry, but not actually dry, 
for that in touching it is felt to be moist, but potentially, 
for that it hath the power of drying, and in substance 
thin, in colour yellow, and in taste bitter. This 
[/67./] 
being bred in the liver, is divided into two parts; the 
unprofitable part is passed over unto the gall, and the 
profitable goeth with the blood into the veines, which 
is for two causes, the one that it may go to nourish 
such parts as in whose composition and complexion 
this humor hath ought to do, the other that by the 
sharpnesse and thinnesse thereof the blood may passe 
the better through the small veines. That which is 
in the gall, is evacuated by a conduct into a gut called 
jejunum, the empty or hungry gut, for that the choler 
comming into it doth clense and scoure it, and so keep 
it empty. And it is evacuated into the guts for two causes; 
the one to clense and scoure them from slimy and 
grosse phlegm, the other to excitate and stimulate them 
to expell the excrementall drosse of the guts. The unnaturall 
[/68./] 
humor of choler is made of it selfe by adustion 
or by admistion of other humors, as with thinne 
phlegm, and it is thin choler, and of the colour of the 
pill of pome citron, called cholera citrina; or with 
[/69./] 
thick phlegm, and then it is thicker, called cholera vitellina, 
[^p.18^] 
because it is like the yolks of egges, which as 
they are some of a paler, some of an higher colour, so 
is this kinde of choler: this choler by the action of 
greater heat doth become green, and is called cholera 
porraria, because it is greene like to leek blades, and by 
greater heat it doth become black like unto rust, and 
[/70./] 
therefore is called æruginosa cholera. Of all these sorts 
of choler the fittest to breed the Gout is that which 
with the blood doth passe into the veines; for together 
with the blood it goeth into all parts, and according 
to the disposition thereof affecteth such parts as 
are offended therewith: the signes whereof shall bee 
[/71./] 
declared hereafter. The last cause internall of the Gout 
is the humor melancholy, which humor is in quality 
cold and dry, in substance thick, and somwhat slimy, 
in colour black, in taste sowre. The originall whereof 
is in the liver, and the thinner part goeth with the 
blood into the veines for the nourishing of such parts 
[/72./] 
as are by constitution melancholick: and the grosser 
part is drawn from the liver by the spleen, which is the 
proper seat of melancholy, and from thence is put over 
into the stomach, and that because it should in the 
mouth of the stomach procure the sense of hunger. 
For hunger is a want of food, the feeling or sense 
whereof is in the mouth of the stomach, and that sense 
is made of the sowernesse of this humor, whereby the 
orifice or mouth of the stomach is shriveled and 
wrinckled, and drawn together, whereof is made a desire 
of food. And these two sorts of melancholy are 
naturall. There are also some unnaturall, as when by 
excesse of heat the naturall melancholy receiveth adustion, 
then is it unnaturall, and called adust, which if 
withall it hath any putrifaction, it breedeth bad melancholy 
[^p.19^] 
fevers. There is another melancholy humor 
[/73./] 
unnaturall, which commeth by the adustion of choler, 
which is a most euill humor, whereof commeth dementia 
ferina, a belluine madnesse, when one is as mad 
as a wild beast. Another unnaturrall humor melancholick, 
doth proceed of the adustion of other humors, 
as of blood and of salt phlegme. The fourth is when 
in the unskilfull cure of tumors there is left an hard 
substance, for this if it should come to exulceration, 
would proue a cancer, a kinde of ulcer which is hardly 
cured, or not at all. Now the Gout doth indeed 
seldome proceed of the melancholick humor: first for 
that there is no great store thereof in mans body: secondly, 
for that this humor is not apt for a deflux, because 
it is grosse. Notwithstanding sometimes it falleth 
out, being mixed with some other humor it may 
communicate with it in the procuring of the Gout. 
And thus farre forth concerning the causes externall 
and internall of the Gout. 
 
[/74./] 
It followeth now that I deliver the signes whereby 
each cause is to bee knowne. And first for the causes 
externall, they are to bee found out by the inquisition 
of the Physitian, and relation of the party, for the 
Physitian must aske the patient of each one, and the patient 
must answer particularly, so shall it appeare by 
what externall meanes he hath gotten his Gout. Wherfore 
hereof I surcease to speake, because it standeth in 
the private conference of the Physitian and patient. 
But concerning the causes internall, they do only stand 
in the skill of the Physitian to judge of, and to discerne 
[/75./] 
by the signes. Wherefore first of the first internall 
cause of the Gout, which is blood. Whereof when it 
proceedeth, it is to bee known by these signes, first of 
[^p.20^] 
the manner of the tumor, for when the Gout proceedeth 
of blood, then doth there concurre a tumor or 
swelling, and that very big. Next of the colour, for 
the tumor will be very red. Thirdly, of the heat of the 
part, for it will be but of a tolerable heat. Fourthly, of 
the manner of the greife, for it will not be extreme, and 
that by distention, for that the fulnesse of blood in the 
part, doth by dissevering such parts as are united, cause 
in the part affected a distending greife. Hereunto must 
bee added the complexion of the patient, which if it 
be sanguine, it confirmeth with the former evidence, 
that the Gout proceedeth of blood. Also the age is 
to be considered, whether the patient be yong; and his 
manner of diet, whether he doth use to eat liberally, 
and that of the best and most nourishing meats and 
drinks. Also his custome of life, whether he live at ease 
and much rest, enjoying many delights, which if they 
concurre to the former, it is the greater confirmation 
of blood. And if any usuall evacuation of bleeding 
by the nose or otherwise bee suppressed, after that the 
Gout befall to the person, it is an argument that it is of 
[/76./] 
blood. If the Gout proceed of choler, then is it 
known by these signes, first the tumor is not so bigge. 
The colour thereof is pale. The heat that followeth 
this humor is most vehement. The paine it procureth 
is untolerable. It is greatly releeved by application of 
cooling things. Hereunto must bee added the complexion 
of the patient, whether it bee cholerick. Also 
his age, whether hee bee in the middle age, which is 
from five and thirty to five and forty, the hot and dry 
time of mans age. And whether his diet hath been of 
cholerick meats, and hot and dry wines. And whether 
hee hath led his life in sorrow and care, or watching, 
[^p.21^] 
or study, or fasting, or hath used great labour 
and travell: which all, or some, if they concurre; because 
they are the breeders of the cholerick humor, 
they signifie unto us the cause of that Gout to bee the 
said humor. But when the Gout proceedeth of a phlegmatick 
[/77./] 
humor, then the tumor thereof will bee very 
big and soft: The colour thereof white. The paine 
not great, except so great quantity of the humor possesse 
the part as that by distention the paine is augmented. 
The heat it procureth is little, and it is releeved 
by application of hot things. The complexion of the 
party is phlegmatick, or having used meats of a cold 
and moist constitution, and lived in much rest, without 
competent exercise, giving himselfe to much sleeping, 
or bathing, and that immediatly after meat. Also 
the old age is a signe of this humor, and the cold 
time of the yeere, as winter, a cold and moist habitation, 
which are both causes and signes of a phlegmatick 
humor. Now if the Gout proceed of a salt phlegme, 
then together with the other signes, there will bee in 
the part affected a great itching, which is caused 
through the saltnesse of the humor. The Gout doth 
[/78./] 
seldome come of a melancholy humor, but when it 
befalleth, it is known by the tumor, for it is little and 
hard, and in colour black. The paines will be as if the 
part were bored with a percer. There will appeare little 
heat, but rather a cold. The person is in the declining 
age, as from forty five to fifty five. His complexion 
is melancholick, and hath used to eat of melancholick 
meats, and to give himselfe to much labour 
and travell, even to overgreat defatigation, his habitation 
is in a cold and dry place, and commonly it haunteth 
him in autumne. Thus farre of the signes of such 
[^p.22^] 
particular causes internall as occasion the Gout: which 
causes being somtimes confounded, as blood and choler; 
or blood with phlegme, or melancholy; or melancholy 
with blood, choler, or phlegme, the signes are 
more hard to bee seene, and therefore the cause more 
hard to be known, and the cure very hard to bee performed; 
for in a confusion it is hard for a man to determine 
upon a certainty, and that which may be good 
for one, is hurtfull to another, whereas things of contrary 
natures and dispositions are confounded together; 
wherefore herein doth cheifly consist the skill 
of a good Physitian, as by the signes to judge whereof 
the confusion is made, and to discerne the one from 
the other, and so to moderate his medicine that in doing 
good to some one which principally hath the dominion, 
it may not work any inconvenience to the 
rest. This because it is a curious peece of work and 
standeth upon many termes of our Art, it will bee but 
obscure and tedious, if I entreat thereof, wherfore here 
an end of this point, which containeth the signes of 
such causes as procure the Gout. 
 
[/79./] 
Now to the next point, whether the Gout may bee 
cured or not? I would I could warrant the cure, for I 
might bee the richest Physitian in England. Many 
make many vaine brags to win them a name, but if a 
man will shew himselfe honest, and good, and to professe 
a troth without collusion or dissimulation, hee 
must needs confesse that he cannot radically cure the 
[/80./] 
Gout, with warrant that it shall never returne. First, 
for that Gout which is by inheritance, it is altogether 
impossible to remove it, for that imperfection which 
commeth by kinde may bee releeved, but not removed 
by Art. And that Gout that commeth by surfetting 
[^p.23^] 
and banquetting, it is most hard for such persons 
to keepe a good diet, wherein indeed the whole 
preservation consisteth. And when the joynts are 
once weakned; it is an hard matter to reclaime them to 
a naturall state, because they are farre from the heart, 
the fountaine of heat, which should bee their comforter. 
Likewise such parts as by their depravation do 
breed the matter of the Gout, will hardly bee reformed; 
for both the part that breedeth, and the parts 
that receive the matter, are so farre distant from the 
stomach, whereinto the helping medicines are to bee 
received, that before they can approach either part, 
they suffer so great alteration, as that they lose their 
proper effect, and cannot work to that purpose upon 
those parts as they should. I adde hereunto, that when 
a water taketh a course; it is hardly restrained so when 
a deflux hath once make a course; it is hardly restrained, 
for the stronger parts will evermore disburden 
themselves by the same course. In ancient time the 
[/81./] 
matter was not so hard, for that people were of a more 
temperate and orderly diet. Then was it true that 
Hippocrates saith, that eunuches were not subject to 
the Gout, for that they used no venery; which because 
it weakneth the joynts and other principall parts, if it 
bee used too often, doth procure the Gout. And that 
women, except their naturall termes were suppressed, 
were not subject to the Gout; so by that evacuation 
their bodies were clensed and preserved from superfluous 
matter. And that no yong man before hee had 
betooke himselfe to venery, could be possessed with the 
Gout. But now because of excessive and disordered diet, 
or some other disorder whereinto this age is incident 
(I know not who can be exempted from the Gout, 
[^p.24^] 
except he can overrule his affections, and direct himselfe 
by great moderation) and having once got it, it 
will bee hard for him to remove it. Paulus Ægineta 
saith, that the Gout by reason of so manifold causes 
whereof it may come, and are hard to be known, doth 
bring with it a very heavy conceit, to wit, that it can 
no way be cured by the Art of Physick. And Trallianus 
saith, that when a humor is once confirmed in a 
joynt, there is no hope that the part can be reclaimed 
to a naturall state. And Galen is of the same opinion, 
which is to bee understood of the perfect and radicall 
cure of the Gout. As for the fit, no doubt there are many 
good meanes to releeve and remove it. Wherefore 
thereof I will entreat, comming now to that point 
which conteineth the cure of the Gout. 
 
The cure of the Gout must bee referred to the causes 
[/82./] 
thereof; for except the cause bee removed, the effect 
will still continue. I have said before, that the causes 
of the Gout are either internall or externall. Now for 
[/83./] 
the cure of the causes externall, as they are to be understood 
by the patient, so he being warned of the Physitian 
to forsake and avoid the same, shall finde a good 
releefe to his Gout. If hee live in such an aire as may 
procure it, the counsell of the Physitian is to change. 
If by overmuch feeding and ingurgitation of meats of 
sundry sorts, then hee must use a more temperate diet. 
If it come by excessive use of drinking, that must bee 
avoided. If it come by ill digestion, then the patient 
must be carefull of better. If it come by overmuch venery, 
that is to be used in more moderation. If it come 
by too much labour, or fasting, or watching, or sorrow, 
or care, then the ground of the cure is to abandon 
the cause. If it come of too much ease, then let the patient 
[^p.25^] 
use more exercise. If of too much walking and 
travell on foot, then let him avoid it. If any usuall evacuation 
be stopped, let the Physitian procure it again, 
or derive it by some other course. And so if the patient 
can tell from whence his Gout either beginnerh, at 
the first, or afterward doth come to a fit, let him avoid 
that cause, and it shall bee a great help unto him: for 
except the patient bee obedient herein, no good cure 
can bee done. The cure of the Gout in respect of the 
[/84./] 
causes internall, have two principall scopes, the one is 
an order of diet, the other consisteth in administration 
of medicines; and neither of these can be generall, but 
particularly must bee appropriated unto the cause. 
Wherefore first I will begin the cure of the Gout proceeding 
from blood. 
 
And first for the diet of the patient, which in all 
[/85./] 
diseases is a principall point, the aire must be somwhat 
disposed to coldnesse and drinesse; sleeping and watching 
must be used moderately. If the belly bee costive, 
it must bee made soluble with gentle clysters, when as 
the flux doth begin, the patient must rest and hold up 
his leg on a stoole, for the motion would draw downe 
the greater deflux, and laying up doth resist the deflux, 
but when it is in declination, a little motion is good, 
for that it doth evacuate that which remaineth. All 
sorrowes and cares, and great perturbations of the 
minde must be avoyded. Little meat must bee used, 
especially if it nourish much, and breed store of blood, 
because that encreaseth the cause. Wherefore in the 
fit of this kinde of Gout the patient should altogether 
abstaine from flesh; or if that cannot bee by reason of 
his weaknesse, then let him eat of birds, especially such 
as live in the hils, as Feldefares, Thrushes, Blackbirds. 
[^p.26^] 
And wine in this cause must altogether bee avoyded, 
for that it is an increaser of blood, and through the heat 
and thinnesse, and peercing property, it searcheth each 
part of the body, and both breedeth and stirreth defluxes. 
Wherefore many by abstaining from wine 
have had more speedy recovery, and longer intermission 
of the Gout. Here also the use of Venus must bee omitted, 
or seldome and moderately used; for there is 
nothing worse to procure the Gout, especially if it bee 
used dayly, and out of season, as when the stomack is 
full, for then it destroyeth concoction, or when the 
body is too empty, for then it spendeth and weakneth 
the body. And here because eating and drinking too 
much breedeth great store of raw humors, the patient 
must give himselfe to a moderate and sober diet, for as 
Hippocrates saith, the principall point of maintaining 
good health, is not to stuffe the stomach too full, and 
to bee ready to put the body to exercise. This order 
being observed in respect of the aire, and eating, and 
drinking, and sleeping, and watching, and resting, 
and stirring, and such like, wee are to descend to the 
[/86./] 
cure. The Gout when it commeth of blood, requireth 
some things inwardly to bee given, and some 
things to bee done outwardly. The order of both is 
[/87./] 
after this sort. First wee must give a lenitive medicine, 
either by clyster or potion, or in a solid substance, which 
must be such as stir not the humors too much, for that 
will encrease the deflux: as by the mouth may bee given 
Cassia, and Manna, and the syrup of roses solutive, 
or such compounds as consist of these and the pulp of 
damaske prunes, and tamarinds, and such like. Next 
it is good to let blood, especially at the first beginning 
of the Gout; for that doth evacuate the matter thereof, 
[^p.27^] 
and the blood must bee let on the same side whereon 
the Gout is; as if it be in the right foot, wee must let 
blood in the right arme in the liver veine, which by 
way of revulsion and plucking back the blood that is 
descending, doth good: And here Galen reporteth 
that by letting of blood in the spring in such as have 
been oft taken with the Gout, hee hath preserved them 
from it a long time. And Ætius is of the same opinion, 
counselling not at the spring only, but more often to 
let blood. But Paulus Ægineta thinketh that such as 
are often troubled with the Gout, shall receive more 
harme than good by letting of blood, especially if the 
body be but of a weak constitution, and inclining to a 
colder state. And Alexander Trallianus is of the same 
opinion, wherefore it must rest in the wisdome of the 
Physitian, to consider of the state of the body, and age 
of the person, and times of the yeere, and such like circumstances, 
which may give him warrant for his action. 
Next we may use some purgation if need bee, so it 
be gentle. And wee must apply to the foot somewhat 
to strengthen the part, and to put back the deflux, and 
to mitigate the paine. To this purpose at the beginning 
[/88./] 
of the fit, wee do use old wine-vineger mixed with 
oyle of roses, especially if the paine be setled any thing 
deep in the joynts; for the vineger doth penetrate, and 
[/89./] 
having an astringent property, doth strengthen the 
part, and because it is cold in operation, it doth repell 
the deflux: and the oile of roses doth both comfort 
the part, and mitigate the paine. If the paine bee not 
grounded so deep, and the inflammation not great, 
then we must use oyle of roses, and a little white wine 
[/90./] 
in sommer not warmed, in winter made a little warm. 
And a stronger than this is, to take of the pil of the 
[^p.28^] 
Pomgranate, and Sumach, and Sengreen, boyle them 
in water and vineger; and adde thereunto the flower 
of barly or beanes, and some oyle of roses, and apply 
it unto the part. Also a Pomgranate if it be boyled and 
brayed in a mortar, is of it selfe good to bee applyed. 
Also it is good to take of Goats milk, and Ewes milk, 
[/91./] 
and boyle therein some flower of barly or beanes, and 
some of the flower of Fenygreek seed, or crummes of 
white bread, and mix therewith the yolks of egges, 
and the oyle of roses, and a little saffron, and vineger, 
which must be applyed and often changed. Also take 
Quinces well boyled, and bray them in a mortar, with 
the crummes of white bread, and oyle of roses, and apply 
[/92./] 
it. When the part must be washed, wee must not 
take water only, but water and vineger warmed, or 
the decoction of some astringent thing. Now when 
by these meanes the deflux is wholly restrained, and 
the paine somwhat ceased, then wee may apply things 
to resolve out that which is descended into the part 
[/93./] 
affected. Such are the oyles of white Lillies, of Camomill, 
of Dill, either applied so, or with a little virgin-wax 
made in forme of an ointment: or the decoction 
of them with Mallowes and Hollyhock leaves, and 
roots, and the seeds of Penygreek, and Linseed, with 
which decoction it shall bee good to bathe the part, 
and the residence of the decoction being beaten in a 
mortar into a pulp, with a little oyle of Roses, and Camomill, 
and Dill mixed together, will bee good to bee 
applyed unto the part. Much more might bee added 
unto this cure, but it would be too tedious, and I must 
[/94./] 
expresse many things in Latine termes, which would 
be obscure. Wherefore I passe over unto the cure of 
the Gout proceeding of choler: And first for the diet, 
[^p.29^] 
the ayre must be inclining to moisture and cold: rest 
[/95./] 
and sleep are to bee used, for watching and labour are 
naught, for that they increase the heat and cholerick 
quality of the humor, in which sense abstinence is alike 
naught: Wherefore it shall bee good for the patient 
to take his meat, as a Ptisan, or the pulp of a Ptisan, or 
a Chicken boyled with Lettuce, and Endive, and Succory, 
or other cold herbs. Boyled meats are better 
than rosted. Albeit, Capon, Hen, Pullet, Fesant, Partridge, 
Blackbird rosted, are allowable. In a cholerick 
state Fish is not disallowed, so it bee such as do feed in 
sandy and gravelly water. Some fruits are not forbidden, 
as Pomgranate, and Peares, and Cherries, and such 
as have some little astriction. The drinke must bee 
small, wherefore wine in this case is most hurtfull. In 
meats and drinks that moderation must bee used, as 
that the stomach be not overcharged. As in the former 
it was tolerable to use but little Venery, so here 
it is altogether forbidden. It is also most hurtfull to 
bee angry and testy, for it inflameth the humor, and 
stirreth it more: wherefore all meanes must bee used 
for musick, or pleasant conceits to delight the patient. 
These for the diet. The administration of medicine 
[/96./] 
hath this kinde of method. First it shall bee good if 
the belly be too costive, to use an emollitive clyster, or 
some of those gentle things prescribed before, as Cassia, 
Manna, syrup of Roses, or Violets solutive, or sugar of 
Violets, or the pulp of Tamarinds, or such like, which 
work upon choler in gentle wise, neither stirring nor 
heating the humor. Then it shall be good to use a vomit, 
as with warme water and vineger; or syrup of 
Acetose or Oxymell, mixed together, and drunk: for 
that by revulsion may do good by plucking back the 
[^p.30^] 
humor descending. Next some for the same cause do 
let blood, but that must bee done with circumspection, 
for that the blood is a bridle to choler, repressing by 
the moystnesse thereof, the drynesse, and heat, and acrimony 
of choler. Wherefore therin the Physitian is 
to use good discretion, whether in the person affected, 
it shall be so expedient or no. After this, the cholerick 
humor which causeth this Gout must be repressed somwhat, 
that is, his acrimony, heat, and fury must bee abated 
by cooling potions, as of Endive, and Succory, 
and Lettuce, and Violet leaves, and Strawbery leaves, 
or such like, either decocted or made in syrup, and taken 
with barly water: or the boyling of a Chicken, or 
some other convenient liquor. This being done, the 
humor is to be purged with Rheubarb, yellow Mirabolans, 
and some of the former contrived into a potion. 
As take of the decoction of cold herbs, or of the distilled 
water of Endive foure ounces, infuse therein all 
night two drammes of Rheubarb, and of the yellow 
Mirabolans one dram, in the morning straine it, and 
expresse it somwhat, then adde thereunto of Cassia one 
ounce and an halfe, of the syrup of Roses solutive two 
ounces mixt altogether, and drinke it in the morning 
fasting, abstaining to eat by foure houres after; then 
take some of the broth of a Chicken, if the deflux continue, 
then the purpation must bee taken againe, untill 
[/97./] 
the cause be somwhat stayed. Next hereunto must bee 
used locall medicines to strengthen the part affected, 
and to coole it, and to appease the greife that the part 
[/98./] 
abideth: Take oile of roses, the yolkes of two egges, 
and a little vineger, it shall both coole, and comfort, 
and mitigate the paine. Or take the juyce or decoction 
[/99./] 
of cooling and astringent herbs, as of Plantaine, Polygonum, 
[^p.31^] 
Sorrell, Purslaine, Nightshade, Singreen, or 
such like, which being grreene and stamped in a mortar, 
may bee applyed to the part for the cooling thereof, 
and repelling of the humor. If hereunto bee added 
some oyle of roses, and some barley flower, it shall bee 
better. Also the seeds of Psyllium being boyled in 
[/100./] 
water, and brayed in a mortar untill it come to a pulp, 
with the flower of barly, and so applyed to the part, 
doth in excellent sort both coole and mitigate the pain. 
[/101./] 
Ætius reporteth of one, that being in most intolerable 
pain of the Gout, put his feet into cold water, and received 
singular reliefe. The pulp of Cassia with the powder 
[/102./] 
of Camomill flowers is well commended to be applyed 
to the part. Now if the paine be so outragious that 
nothing can asswage it, then we do use some things to 
dull the sense of the part, which are to bee used with 
great circumspection. Such are Henbane, and Poppy, 
[/103./] 
and Hemlock, and juyce of black Poppy called opium. 
This must bee used in little quantity, and must not lie 
[/104./] 
long to the part. And when the part is amended, then 
some warme things must bee applyed to recover the 
cold disposition which by these extreme cooling things 
is got into the part. Now to come to the cure of the 
[/105./] 
Gout proceeding of a phlegmatick humor. And first 
for the diet: The aire must be hot and dry, whereunto 
if the time of the yeere doe not serve, then it must bee 
procured by art. Much sleepe is not good, but some 
watching is better, because it doth dry. And for the 
same cause fasting is good in this kinde of Gout: moist 
[/106./] 
meats are hurtfull, as Veale, Lamb, Pig: Conies, and 
such birds as are rehersed before are better: Fish is 
[/107./] 
not good, but if it bee taken, it must bee boyled with 
Hysop, and Thyme, and winter Savory, and some such 
[^p.32^] 
hot & dry herbs, to correct the moistnes therof. Wine 
is forbidden, but yet it may be best tolerated in this 
kind of Gout. All fruits & cold herbs must be avoyded. 
The manner of cure is to procure a vomit, if the patient 
be apt thereunto, and do it with some facility. Next 
the humor must bee prepared with such things as doe 
extenuate and rarifie the humor, as hony made with 
roses, and hony made with vineger, called oxymell; 
or with the syrup or decoction of stæchas and betony, 
and such like. Then must the humor bee purged with 
such purgatives as do respect phlegm: as with Agarick, 
and the seeds of Cartamus, and the great Mirabolans, 
and Diaphenicon, and Electuarium Indum, 
and such like infused and mixed in a convenient liquor. 
After purgation, if the person do much abound in cold 
[/108./] 
humors, it shall bee good to give him Treacle or Mithridate. 
After this wee may come to the locall medicines, 
which in the beginning must bee somewhat 
discussive, and more astrictive; in the encrease of it 
they must be lesse astrictive, and more discussive; and 
in the very rigor thereof they must be such as ease the 
[/109./] 
paine, and discusse: and in the declination they must 
be wholly discussive to resolve out that matter which 
by deflux is descended into the part. But therein this 
observation must bee used, that things of too hot operation 
bee not applied; for the thinner part of the humor 
will be resolved, and the grosser will grow into a 
hard substance, whereof commeth that incurable Gout 
called nodosa, the knotted Gout.
