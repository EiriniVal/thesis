[}Of the beginning and spreading of 
Lues Venerea. Cap. I.}] 
 
THis disease now vsually called Lues Venerea, 
did first appeere, as the learned Physitions 
Monardus and Montanus, and also 
that learned Surgeon Vigo, with others, 
do affirme, in the yeere of our Lord God, 
1494. in the month of December, when 
the French King tooke his iorney to recouer 
the kingdom of Naples: at which time 
hapned amongst the soldiers and people, 
this disease to appeere: which was at that 
time termed by the French men, Morbus 
Neapolitanus: but they of Naples, called it Morbus Gallicus. Which 
name, hath so in common speech remained with vs vntill this day. I do 
not heere purpose to argue to the contrary, but onely I meane to deliuer 
vnto you plainly the whole order of the cure, according vnto those gifts 
and graces, which God of his great goodnes hath bestowed vpon me. 
 
If I be not deceiued in mine opinion (friendly Reader) I suppose 
the disease it selfe was neuer more rife in Naples, Italie, France 
or Spaine, than it is at this day in the Realme of England. I pray 
God deliuer vs from it, and to remooue from vs that filthy sinne that 
breedeth it. It is woonderfull to consider, the huge multitude of such as be 
infected, and that daily increase, to the great danger of many. The causes 
whereof, I see none so great, as the licentious and beastly disorder of 
a great number of rogues and vagabonds, the filthy life of many lewde 
and idle persons, men and women, about the citie of London, &c. By 
meanes of which disordered persons, some other of better disposition are 
many times infected, and many more like to be, except there be found 
some redresse for the same: I may speake boldly, bicause I speake truly: 
and yet I do speak it with greefe of minde, that in the Hospitall of Saint 
Bartholomew in London, there hath beene cured of this disease by me 
and three others, within fiue yeeres, to the number of one thousand and 
more. I speake nothing of Saint Thomas Hospitall, and other houses 
[^p.150^] 
about the citie, wherein an infinite multitude are daily cured. The Masters 
of the foresaid Hospitals, being mooued with deuotion, and a 
christianlike care towards these wicked and sinfull creatures, are daily 
inforced to take in a number of these diseased people, that otherwise 
would infect many good and honest persons: seeking with like care to restraine 
this greeuous infection, and yet the number still increaseth. It 
happened very seldom in the Hospitall of Saint Bartholomewes, whilest 
I staied there: amongst euery twentie so diseased, that were taken 
into the said house, which was most commonly vpon the Monday, ten 
of them were infected with Lues Venerea: and therefore how carefully 
it ought to be looked vnto, let euery man iudge that hath care of his own 
health, and here I protest, that the very cause that mooued me to set 
foorth this booke, is not of vaine glory, neither to incourage such kinde of 
people to wallow or continue in their beastly life, thinking by this 
booke, or any other whatsoeuer, to be able to deliuer themselues from 
this odious sicknes. But euen in the loue of my countreymen, partly to 
admonish them to amend their liues, and partly to helpe those good people 
that be infected by eating or drinking, or keeping co~pany vnawares 
with those diseased persons: which either for shame, dare not bewray it, 
or for lacke of good Surgeons know not how to remedy it, or for lacke of 
abilitie, are not able otherwise to prouide for the cure of it. And last of 
all to show the way of helpe to cure all such as be infected, and by that 
meanes, if it may so stand with the good pleasure of Almightie God, to 
stop the further spreading of the same. 
 
And thus I haue by long digression (although not any thing besides 
the matter) slipped from speaking of the original of this disease, vnto the 
complaint of the mightie increase thereof, growne in this land, al which 
I refer vnto the good consideration of euery discret Reader. 
 
[}The maner of taking this sicknesse, with the causes and 
signes thereof. Cap. 2.}] 
 
THis sicknesse is said first to be ingendred by the 
[/1./] 
vnlawful copulation and accompanying with 
vncleane women, or common harlots, which although 
it be for the most part true, yet it is not alwaies 
so, nor in all persons: for I my selfe haue 
knowne, both men and women, greeuously infected 
with this sicknes, which haue had those parts 
that bring the most suspition thereof, and are 
most speedily infected, free and cleere from all kinde of maladie, or shew 
[^p.151^] 
of any such disease: whereas, if the infection had hapned by that means, 
those parts should in reasonable likelihood haue been first touched, as being 
most apt to putrifie, by reason of the humiditie & loosenes of the part, 
which engendreth vlcerations of all sorts, apostumes, dolors, putrifactions, 
and venemous pustules, &c. 
 
I haue also knowne diuers persons infected, who haue had in all 
other parts of the bodie manifest signes thereof, as dolors, tumors, vlcers, 
and venemous pustules, &c. And yet in the parts aforesaid, no 
paine, or any signe thereof: so that their opinion is not to be obserued, 
which affirme, that this disease is ingendred onely, by the company of 
vncleane persons: for I haue knowne not many yeeres past, three good 
[/2./] 
and honest Midwiues infected with this disease, called Lues Venerea, 
by bringing abed three infected women, of three infected children, which 
infection was chiefly fixed vpon the Midwiues fingers and hands, &c. 
What should I speake of yoong sucking children, whereof diuers haue 
been greeuously vexed with this disease, and some of them a moneth, 
two, three or fower moneths old, and some of them a yeere old, some 
fower or fiue yeeres old, and some of them sixe or seauen yeeres old, 
[/3./] 
amongst which sort, I thought it good here to note a certaine wench, 
the daughter of one Sare, of twelue yeeres of age, the which I cured, 
in the yeere of our Lord 1567. who was greatly infected with this sicknesse 
in many parts of hir body, hauing thereon painfull nodes or hard 
swellings and vlcers, with corruption of the bones, and yet no signe in 
the most suspected parts, neither by reason of debilitie was able to haue 
committed any such act, but it is not to be doubted, but that she receiued 
the infection, either from the parents, the which cure of some is supposed 
vncertaine, whether children begotten by infected parents, may be 
[/4./] 
cured or not: or else she was infected, as diuers are, by sucking the corrupt 
milke of some infected nurse, of whom I haue cured many, for 
such milke is ingendred of infected blood, and I may not here in conscience 
ouerpasse, to forewarne thee good Reader, of such lewde and filthie 
nurses: for that in the yeere 1583. it chanced that three yoong children, 
all borne in this citie of London, all of one parish, or very neere togither, 
and being of honest parentage, were put to nurse, the one in the 
countrie, and the other two were nursed in this citie of London: but 
within lesse than halfe a yeere, they were all three brought home to their 
parents and freends, greeuously infected with this great and odious disease, 
by their wicked and filthy nurses: Then their parents seeing them 
[/5./] 
thus miserably spoiled and consumed with extreme paines, and great 
breaking out vpon their bodies, and being so yoong, sicke and weake, vnpossible 
to be weaned, were forced, as nature doth binde, to seeke by all 
[^p.152^] 
meanes possible to preserue these poore seely infants, which else had died 
most pitifully. To be breefe, ere euer those children could be cured, they 
had infected fiue sundry good & honest nurses: I cured one of the children, 
and the nurse which gaue it sucke, the other two children & their nurses 
were also cured by others, but one of the children liued not long after, 
as I was giuen to vnderstand. Also freendly Reader, I read of late in a 
[/6./] 
certain history, written by Ambrose Pare, in his 2. book, intreating of the 
causes of Lues Venerea, which history indeed is woorthy the rehearsall: 
"An honest Citizen saith he, granted his most chaste wife, that she should 
nurse the childe which she was lately deliuered of, if she would keepe a 
nurse to be partaker of the trauell and paines: the nurse that she tooke 
by chance, was infected with Lues Venerea, therefore she did presently 
infect the foster childe, and he the mother, and she the husband and he 
two children which he had daily at his table & bed, not knowing of that 
poison which he did nourish in his own body and intrals. But when the 
mother considered and perceiued, that hir childe did not prosper or profit 
by the nourishment, but continually cried and waxed waiward, desired 
me to tell hir the cause of that disease, neither was it any hard matter to 
do, for his body was full of the small pocks, whelks, and venereous 
pustules: and the brests of the nurses and mother being looked on, were 
eroded with virulent vlcers: and the body of the father and his two 
sonnes, the one about three yeeres, and the other fower yeeres of age, 
were infected with the like pustules and swellings that the childe had: 
therfore I shewed them that they were all infected with Lues Venerea, 
whose beginnings, and as it were prouocations, were spred abroad by 
the nurse that was hired, by hir maligne infection. I cured them all, 
and by the helpe of God, brought them to health, except the sucking 
childe, which died in the cure: and the nurse being called before the maiestrates, 
was punished in prison, & whipped closely, and had been publikely 
whipped through all the streets of the citie, if it had not been for 
the honor of that vnfortunate family." Thus we see children infected by 
filthy nurses, and somtimes nurses be infected by giuing sucke to such 
infected children. And now to returne to my former purpose, the disease, 
as saith Nicholas Masa, whose counsell and direction in the cure of this 
disease I haue greatly obserued. The disease bicause it hath a flowing 
matter, being once entred into any part of the body, proceedeth on from 
part to part, neuer resting vntill it hath corrupted the liuer, with the ill 
disposition of this infection especially. When it toucheth any such part, 
as hath in it an apt disposition to admit such infection, as when the action 
or force of the agent is wrought and imprinted in the patient, fitly 
affected to receiue the same forme, and so it disperseth it selfe through 
[^p.153^] 
the whole bodie: likewise this sicknesse is many times bred in the 
mouth, by eating and drinking with infected persons, and sometimes 
onely by breathings: and Almanor a learned Physition setteth downe 
for a truth, that this disease may be taken by kissing, and somtimes by lying 
in the bed with them, or by lying in the sheets after them: also it is 
said to come by sitting on the same stoole of easement, where some infected 
person frequenteth, and sometimes such as haue beene cured of this 
disease, fall into it againe by wearing their olde infected apparell: all 
which causes of this disease I rather set downe, for that I woulde 
thereby admonish as many, as shall read this treatise, to be carefull of 
themselues in this behalfe, and to shun as much as may be, all such occasions. 
Now all these outward causes being considered, it remaineth that 
I speak also of the inward causes of the nourishing of this disease, which 
(as Nicolas Massa saith) is the liuer, whose il disposition is as it were the 
fountaine, roote and spring thereof: for sith in the liuer is made the separation 
of all the humors of mans body, as by the good temperature and 
disposition thereof good humors are bred: euen so by the euill disposition 
[/7./] 
thereof, corrupt humors are ingendred, so that from the liuer doth proceede 
the matter of nourishment, and the faculties of nourishment to al 
the body, and it is in respect the maintainer of life: and therfore it is not 
to be doubted (saith he) but that the corruption of the liuer is the roote 
of this disease. 
 
And if it be obiected, that the disease is taken by externall meanes 
as aforesaid, by kissing, eating and drinking, clothes infected, milke of 
nurses, &c. and therefore the liuer is not the cause, and so the definition 
then can not be true: It is answered, that any outward part being once 
infected, the disease immediately entreth into the blood, & so creepeth on 
like a canker from part to part, vntill it commeth to the liuer, where being 
once entred, it corrupteth the fountaine of blood, and from thence 
sendeth foorth the infection by the veines into euery part of the body: and 
thus this may grow at the first, or after the cure vsed: for it any one part 
hath beene left vnperfectly cured, it may soone returne againe, and make 
the disease more dangerous and harder to be cured, that it was at the 
beginning. But to speake more briefly of this matter, there be generally 
three causes of this sicknes, that is to say. 
 
The Primitiue, the Antecedent, and Coniunct cause, which I gather 
[/8./] 
thus. The Primitiue cause is some bodily touching, either of some infected 
body, as by sheets, or wearing infected apparell, &c. 
 
The antecedent cause is humors, offending in qualitie or quantitie, 
[/9./] 
or both. 
 
The cause coniunct, are those corrupt humors, or that euill qualitie 
[/10./] 
[^p.154^] 
that resteth and is setled in the parts affected. 
 
The sicknesse it selfe is of diuers men diuersly defined, but the chiefest 
writers, I meane those which my selfe read, as Nicholas Massa, &c. 
[/11./] 
do define it to be an affection of the Liuer: but Ambrose Pare noteth 
in the third chapter of his booke, De Morbo Gallico: that it hath his 
principall seat and place of grosse and slimie fleame infected, with the 
maligne qualitie of venereous venome, and the originall beginning being 
taken by a certaine contagious consequence, to creepe into the humors 
sooner or slower, according to the disposition of the body of euery 
one. To returne, I said the opinion of some is, that the antecedent cause 
is the masse of blood contained in the fower humors, which wasteth the 
spirits: & the effects therof (as I gather) are these, it corrupteth the blood, 
and poisoneth the whole humors of the body, and breedeth in the parts 
thereof pains and aches, virulent and malignant vlcers, nodes, or knobby 
hardnes, foule scabs, tetters, and ringwormes both in the hands and 
feete, and callous vlcers about the priuy parts: also that impostume in 
the grinde called Bubo Venereus, likewise a stinking and virulent gonorrhea, 
or running of the reines, with great paine and difficultie in 
making their water: Moreouer, venemous pustules and scabs vpon the 
forehead, browes, face, and beard, and in other parts of the body, as in 
the corners of the lips, especially in infants: the haires do fall from the 
head and beard, paines and aches in the head, shoulder blades, hips, 
thighes and ioints, which pains afflicting most in the night, and ceasing 
in the day time, a certaine heauines and painfull aking of the body after 
sleepe, as though they were broken asunder, sometimes a little feauer, 
and in some a lingring consumption or wasting of the bodie, there followeth 
also this contagious sicknes, bunchey nodes, & filthy abscessions 
or apostumes, with corruption of the bones of the head, called Talpa, 
and vpon the armes and legs called Tophus or Gommata, especially in 
old sicknesses, hauing their beginning of grosse and slimy fleame: and 
oftentimes I haue knowne these bones corrupted and rotten, and the 
flesh round about it found, nothing at all touched. Further it is to be noted, 
that the pustules or moist scabs differ in color and disposition, according 
to the humor, which most ruleth in them: for sometimes they appeere 
red, puffed vp and swelled, and then it is said blood cheefly ruleth: 
somtimes they be red without swelling, hauing filthy matter, and a certaine 
drinesse about them, and then choler beareth rule in them: sometimes 
they be blew and wan, with grosse matter, and then they proceede 
most of melancholy: finally, they are somtimes white, broad, and soft, 
and then fleame hath the dominion. And thus I haue breefly noted what 
I haue read and found out by experience, concerning the beginning, 
[^p.155^] 
spreading, causes and signes of this sicknesse, the which I confesse, I 
should haue more orderly set downe in particular Chapters, with the 
prognostications, which in some sort are partly omitted. But for that I 
followed this course of writing in my former bookes, I meane not heere 
[/12./] 
now to alter or change my order and method, which I haue already 
published: neuerthelesse, I trust no well meaning man shall iustly finde 
fault with the truth of the matter and maner of curing, &c. Wherefore 
I will begin first with preparing and purging of the body, &c. 
 
[}The way to cure Lues Venerea, beginning first with 
euacuation. Cap. 3.}] 
 
THe maner of cure (so far foorth as I meane in this 
short Treatise to deale with) consisteth of these 
parts, that is, of euacuation, diet, and vse of vnctions: 
euacuation is the first of these three to be 
vsed, namely purgings, letting of blood, and sweating, 
according to mine owne way & order of curing. 
Purging first is very necessary, for that many 
vse to cure this disease onely by euacuation 
and purging, especially when the sicknesse is newly taken, & the nature 
of the patient strong and lusty, but we daily finde, that purgings are very 
seldome sufficient, if the disease haue continued any time, or taken 
deepe roote, or if there be in the patient any debilitie or weaknes of nature, 
or much abundance of infected humors or matter, dispersed ouer 
the whole body. 
 
So according to my former sayings, we vse to begin our cure with 
preparing and purging of the body, wherein the learned Physition 
ought to be counselled with: for I read that Hippocrates, whose iudgement 
heerein is vnreproouable, saith: That it is very expedient to 
purge the digested humor, and in no wise to mooue the vnconcocted 
and raw matter: therefore that which is thicke is to be thinned, and 
that which is clammie must be absterged, and the obstructed passages 
are to be opened by conuenient syrrups and waters, such like as here 
presently shall be noted, and the humors being thus ripened, are afterwards 
to be purged by pils, potions, and other good purgations, according 
vnto the discretion of the learned: Otherwise it is not meete that 
euery one should follow his owne aduise and counsell herein. Now 
presently I thinke good to set downe what preparatiues, pils, and other 
purgations may conueniently be vsed in this cure, which I haue by 
long experience and diligent practise obserued and approoued, &c.

&c, 
 
[^p.159^] 
[}A very short note of the maner and order of blood 
letting in this sicknesse. Cap. 4.}] 
 
COncerning letting of blood, which is the second 
kind of euacuation: I hope it may be lawfull for 
me in some sort to speak, according to mine owne 
experience and obseruations heerein. 
 
It is commonly called the opening of a veine, 
wherein are many obseruations to be noted, especially 
these three: the strength of the body, the constitution 
of aire, and the motion and place of the 
planets. The strength of the patient is to be considered 
by view of al the actions of the body, that ts to say, of the Animal 
actions, of the Uitall actions, & Naturall actions: For if the patient haue 
his feeling and moouing powers, which is reason, imagination, and memory 
sound and good, then (as I read) he is strong in his Animal actions. 
 
And likewise are his Uitall actions good, if his pulse be strong, and his 
respiration good, free, and easie. The Naturall actions are concoctions, 
distribution, & assimilation: farther I noted of late out of certain learned 
writers, that the signes and tokens are truly taken of the vrine, sweate, 
and the excrements of the belly, all which do betoken strength, if they be 
most like to the whole and sound persons: and contrariwise they argue 
weaknesse if they vary, or be very vnlike the sound and perfect parts. It 
is moreouer conuenient to looke, that the patient that must bleed be neither 
too yoong nor too old, for children are not commonly let blood before 
the age of fourteene yeeres, nor old folkes after threescore, except 
some great cause enforce, and then neither age, nor yet the signe is much 
to be regarded. Againe yee shall note, that it is not meete to let blood in 
this sicknesse at all times, especially those persons which are oppressed 
with many cold and raw humors, for so by blood letting the humors are 
made the more crude and rawe, and then the patient thus infected, 
will be the worse and harder to be cured. These causes I say being 
well considered of, with the age and strength of the patient, then it is requisite 
that the constitution of the aire be also obserued, and the time of 
the yeere, therefore the aire may not be too hot nor too cold, bicause heate 
dissolueth and weakneth the strength, and cold congealeth & thickeneth 
the blood, and hindereth the expulsion of things noisome: the aire therefore 
must be temperate. And lastly, touching the motion and place of the 
planets, it is said to be very dangerous to touch any part of mans body 
with launce or knife, when the moone hath motion in that signe, which 
[^p.160^] 
gouerneth the part that should be striken or incised, as to open a veine 
in the head when the moone is in Aries: or in the necke when it is in 
Taurus, in the armes the moone being in Gemini, &c. But specially note 
these three rules, if the moone be in Leo, by the which the hart is gouerned, 
it hath beene thought of many then very dangerous to be let blood at 
all: if the moone be in Gemini which doth respect the armes then must 
no veine be touched on the right arme, or on the left. 
 
[/23./] 
Thirdly, three veines are most vsually to be opened: the first is called 
Cephalica, that is the head veine, which is the vpper veine that appeereth 
in the bowing of the arme, and that for the paines and diseases of 
the head. 
 
[/24./] 
The second is called Hepatica, or the liuer veine, which also appeereth 
at the bowing of the arme, and serueth for the obstructions, and 
other affects of the liuer. 
 
[/25./] 
The third is called Mediana, that is, the middle veine, which is made 
of both those aforesaid, and respecteth both head and liuer, and is opened 
with lesse danger. To the former rules (which note as the fourth) that 
on the day of the change or full moone, or on the next day following, or 
going before, letting of blood is not good, except (as I said before) that 
there be some other vehement necessitie, and great perill doth require, 
then we may not in any wise tarrie, or stay till the signe be good: but 
presently open the veine, least peraduenture the patient, which should 
be let blood, do happen to die in the meane space. For truly I haue seene 
and knowen many restored to their perfect health, by letting of blood, 
when the signe hath beene accounted and knowen to be very dangerous 
and ill: and likewise I haue seene others that were so curious, that they 
would in no wise let blood, when the signe was in the place, but after 
they did repent themselues, when it was too late. Thus you haue heere 
briefly the two first kinds of euacuation. The third which is sweating, 
shall be handled heereafter, when I shew the vse of vnctions. Now presently 
followeth that I also speake somwhat as concerning diet, &c. 
 
[}The order of diet in this cure. Cap. 5.}] 
 
THis third part, which I purpose heere to speake of in 
[/26./] 
the cure of this sicknes, is diet. Wherein first it is to be 
obserued, that the meates which the patient must vse, 
ought to be of easie digestion, and of good nourishment, 
and such as ingender fewest superfluities and excrements, 
as white bread not too much leauened, not too 
stale, nor too new, except there be some other speciall intention and purpose: 
[^p.161^] 
the flesh must neither be very yoong nor very old, nor too moist as 
porke or lambe, nor too dry, as beefe and venison. These following are 
very good, weathers mutton, veale, lambe, and kid, being fed in drie 
grounds, yoong hares and rabbets, chickens, capons, hens, partriges, feasants, 
and birds of the woods and mountains: any of these may be giuen 
to the sicke patient, either rosted or sodden, without salt or spice, except 
some speciall cause require the contrarie. But yet you may boile in your 
broths prunes, raisons of the sun, and currants, with spinage, parsley, 
and white beetes: and your broths must be also thickened with white 
bread, and seasoned with veriuice, &c. Swines flesh, salt meates, geese and 
ducks, and such wilde foules as liue in waters, are not wholsome in this 
case, but rather do great hurt: fish is not greatly to be liked of, bicause it 
is cold and moist, neither cheese, for it is hard of digestion: egs potched, 
or put in broths, are very good: all rawe waterish and cold fruits are to 
be eschewed, for they ingender rawe humors and putrifactions: and 
sweete wines in this case, saith Nicholas Massa, are not to be vsed: for 
they cause obstructions, and also make great heate and boiling in the 
bodie, and old wine doth not nourish: but generally I haue found good 
small and stale ale in the cure of this sicknes best. And ye shall specially 
obserue in this way of curing, that if the patient be weake of body, that 
then euery morning before ye enter him into the vnction, and so to sweat 
in his bed, that you giue vnto him some good caudell or aleberrie, as 
this or the like, +R. Ale, sugar, the yelke of an egge or two, and the crust of 
white bread, boile all these togither, and so drinke it hot: or else in the 
stead of a caudell or aleberry, you may giue them to drinke the broth of a 
chicken or mutton, or else a messe of new milke sod with some sugar: 
this doth greatly comfort and strengthen the sicke patient, and prouoketh 
sweat the sooner: and note that such as be great eaters and drinkers, 
and immoderate vsers of women: and otherwise be disordered 
persons are vnfit for this cure, and their healths almost are not to be 
looked for. But when any man shall enter into this diet and cure, there 
must be chosen a fit place for the patient to lie in, free from corrupt aires, 
such (I mean) as be in moist marish grounds, stinking ditches and lakes, 
laystals, riuers and springs, &c. And let your chamber be close, and voide 
of open aire, and well rectified with sweete sauours and smels. And thus 
much as touching the third part of this cure, which respecteth dieting of 
the patient. And now followeth the vse of vnctions or ointments, and 
that is as it were, the perfection of the whole cure, &c. 
 
[^p.162^] 
[}The maner and order of annointing, with other necessarie 
obseruations to be considered of in 
this cure. Cap. 6.}] 
 
THe fourth part of the cure of this disease, so far 
foorth (as I haue said) I haue purposed to deale 
with, consisteth chiefly in vnctions, which part I 
meane heere through Gods assistance, truly and 
plainly to set downe, and first of all I thinke it 
best to expresse the way and order of annointing 
with the vnctions made of quicksiluer, which is 
thus. The chamber being first prouided in a decent 
place, as is said in the Chapter going before, then let the patient be 
prepared to bed, and if it be in the sommer time, then let the chamber be 
strowed with rushes, the leaues of willowes, violets, roses, baies, vine 
leaues, and other coole and sweete herbes, sometimes being sprinkled 
with vineger and rose water. But in the winter time, and in very colde 
weather, let there be made a good fire of coles, rather in a pan, than in a 
[/27./] 
chimney. Now heere freendly Reader, I haue thought it good vpon speciall 
occasion, to note vnto you the great and perilous dangers which 
my selfe haue seene and knowen to follow vpon a sudden, by reason of 
the venemous cloudy vapors of charcoles, which hath smothered and 
strangled diuers and sundry persons, being placed in close chambers, before 
the coles were first throughly burned in the open aire, or in a chimney: 
and then after they be well burned, they may be safely vsed 
without all danger: and hauing a pan of coles thus prepared, then before 
you annoint him or hir whatsoeuer they be, giue them to drinke 
some good caudle, which will comfort and strengthen the stomacke, as 
is before said, and procure sweate the sooner: then next let him be annointed 
against a good fire of coles, and then they must rub or chafe it in 
well with their owne hands, if it be possible their strength will serue, 
& those parts or places that are to be annointed, are first the soles of the 
feete, and so vp to the knees, also the thighes, buttocks, loines, and share 
bones, and likewise annoint both the armes, and vnder the arme holes, 
and the shoulder blades: but in any wise, as neere as you can, touch not 
the head, neither come neere any other principall parts with the vnction, 
as the belly, for thereby truly I haue seene greeuous accidents to follow, 
and oftentimes death, as hereafter shall be declared. The annointing 
being thus finished, let a warme sheete be put round about the patient, 
and a double kercher well warmed, and bound about his head, and 
[^p.163^] 
so couer him in his bed, with as many clothes as he is well able to beare: 
but if therewith he cannot sweate orderly, as you would desire, then applie 
to the soles of his feete, legs, thighes, and to both his sides, very hot 
bricks well wrapped in warme double clothes, or else bottels filled with 
very hot water, or in steede thereof woodden boxes, of twelue inches 
long, and made round, with a lid at one end, and hollow like a pipe, and 
[/28./] 
well plated in the inside, wherein you shall put a long round peece of hot 
iron, so big as will easily go into the boxe, and then put on the lid, and 
wrap three or fower of these boxes in hot clothes, and applie them to the 
places aforenamed: and when the patient doth begin to sweat, that then 
you shall haue in a readinesse, a clocke watch, or houre glasse, that you be 
not deceiued of the time in their sweating, and then halfe an houre before 
they haue sweat out the full time, be it either two or three houres 
or more, as the necessitie of the cause requireth, then begin to abate his 
clothes by little and little, and so let him or hir coole by degrees, but take 
heede of sudden or ouer hastie cooling: moreouer, if it so fall out in the 
time of his sweating, that he be greatly desirous to drink, then you may 
admit him ale warmed with a toste, or else warme posset ale, being put 
into a glasse which hath a long pipe, and let it be giuen him by his keeper, 
[/29./] 
for himselfe may not put his hands out of the bed, to giue himselfe 
drink, for feare of colde: also if he chance to grow faint in his sweating, 
you may safely giue him now and then of Manus Christi, and likewise 
let him smell to rose water & viniger, and cast it suddenly into his face: 
and when his sweats be orderly finished and done, and his shirt that he 
sweate in is well dried and warmed, then let him put it on quickly, and 
also a waste cote, or warme dublet, and about his necke a halfe sheete 
warmed, and keepe his head likewise very warme, and let him sit vp in 
his bed, then giue him some warme broths, &c. He must be thus annointed 
and ordered, two or three daies togither or more, as you see occasion, 
vntill the fluxe of flegmatike matter doth begin to flow from the mouth 
moderately, which doth happen commonly within two, three, or fower 
daies, &c. Then cease from annointing, for otherwise it is very dangerous, 
as shall be declared. This being thus done, then will the gums, 
cheekes, toong and throte ranckle, vlcerate and swell, which may safely 
be cured, by this maner and order following. First, let there be bounde 
[/30./] 
vnder his chin, a double linnen cloth, and pinned vp to his kercher, and 
then wash and gargarise his mouth with new milke, wherein you may 
seeth a few violet leaues, and columbine leaues, and syrup of violets, 
and sometime this following, 
 
+R. Aquæ hord.

Or else take,

Use these two or three daies, and then let the mouth, gums and throte 
be throughly mundified and clensed with this lotion, which I haue prooued 
to be singular good, &c.

Boile all these togither, till one part be consumed, then take it from 
the fire and straine it, and so keepe it to your vse. The mouth must be 
washed, and the throte gargarised with this lotion three or fower times 
a day, vntill the paines be ceased, the teeth fastened, and the vlcers of the 
mouth and throte clensed and healed. But if the vlceration in the mouth 
and throte be so rebellious, that it will not yeeld to these remedies, as oftentimes 
I haue seene: then I vse to touch the vlcers of the mouth, two 
or three times, or more, with Aqua fallopii, or some other good Mercury 
water, or else with Vnguentum AEgyptiacum being first warmed, & afterward 
you may safely cure it with my foresaid lotion, wherunto now 
[^p.165^] 
and then I do ad Mel ros. q. s. & then after the vlcers in the mouth be wel 
mundified & clensed, I do after vsually cure the same with my lotion only. 
I know I might here set down a number of other lotions tending to 
the same purpose, but I will omit them. And thus briefly haue I spoken 
of the maner of annointing, & the order of sweating, and the cure of the 
mouth: which with great foresight, care, & diligence is to be looked vnto: 
for otherwise if it be neglected, then doth follow most commonly great & 
dangerous accidents, & this may come either by the disobedience & vnrulines 
of the patient, or else through the ignorance or negligence of the 
Surgeon, not regarding the malice and sharpnesse of the fluxe, whereby 
it doth happen often times, that some haue beene eaten cleane through 
the cheeks, & also haue had their Vuula therby taken away, by the means 
heereof they haue lost their speeches and voices, others haue lost their 
teeth and mandible or iaw withall, insomuch they were neuer able afterward 
to receiue any food to sustaine them, but onely with a spoone vntill 
their dying day. Therefore I am heere to aduertise thee good Reader, 
to be very wary of such carelesse and ignorant Surgeons, for those dangers 
and causes before spoken of: likewise I do againe admonish all good 
and skilfull Artists, to eschew and beware as much as possible they 
may, all such disobedient, vnruly, disordered, and vnfortunat patients, 
which are oftentimes the onely cause of their owne misery, and so shame 
[/32./] 
and discredit vnto their Physition or Surgeon: wherfore at the beginning 
[/33./] 
of such great and immoderat fluxes at the mouth, defer no time, but 
with all speed aske counsell of the learned Physition or Chirurgeon, and 
be nothing ashamed so to do, least as (I haue said) you repent when it is 
too late, and excuse your selfe, with noddies had I wist: but where no 
conference can presently be had, there prepare thy selfe to make this clyster 
heere following, 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^]

the bones be ready to separate from the flesh, and take of this decoction

Boile any of these till it be thicke and hard, and then make it round, 
greater at the one end than at the other, and in length three, fower, or 
fiue inches, and when you administer it, annoint the fundament with 
Ol. amygdalorum, or with Ol. ros. or Butyri recentis q. s. and also let 
him drinke of a caudell, wherein you may in such extremities put the 
powders of 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^]

And also giue them to drinke of Almond milke, and of a Cinnamon 
water, and for to strengthen and warme his stomack, giue hir or him at 
times, conserue of Roses +Q. ii. Mithridat. +Q. j. Misce. And morouer, to 
helpe to preuent these euill accidents of the mouth, let the patient hold 
in his mouth Butyri recentis, and also now and then in like maner Ol. 
amygdalorum dul. q. s. they do helpe to mollifie the hard swelling of the 
cheekes, & will be a means greatly to preserue the mouth from the malice 
and sharpnesse of those vile and vicious humors, which corrode and 
eate the parts: these likewise are profitable helpes to repell and draw 
backe great fluxes at the mouth: first let there be set certaine cupping 
glasses vpon the shoulders, and vpon the muskles of Hypochondria, or 
vpon the loines, and vpon both the buttocks: and it is very good also to 
vse somtimes frictions or rubbings, and likewise in great extremities I 
haue seene profit by the vse of Vesicatories to blister the shoulders and 
hinder parts, which Vesicatories are made thus,

All these are necessary helps being vsed in due time. 
 
Heere also note, that often times it chanceth the patient hath little 
flux at the mouth, but onely it floweth altogither downward by stoole, 
and that abundantly, and this may chance either by disorder of the patient 
in taking of cold, or else by applying of the vnction vpon the belly, 
which fluxe in some hath easily beene staied, and the patient so perfectly 
cured, and neuer had any fluxe at the mouth: but in some it hath beene 
staied with great difficultie and much danger. Againe in other some it 
could neuer be staid, but they haue died with the extremity of the flux. 
And heere yee shall obserue & note, that I haue applied the vnction being 
very strong and good vnto sundry bodies, ten and twelue times togither, 
[/36./] 
and yet by no maner of meanes I could bring them to any fluxe, either 
at the mouth or downewards: but in such fluxes aforesaid giue the patient 
also to drinke of Cow milke, and of Gotes milke, wherin hath been 
oftentimes quenched hot gads of steele, adding thereto also a peece of fine 
sugar, and a cup or two of Ipocras may be permitted, as by experience I 
haue often seene. 
 
And it is good to take Conserue~ prunellorum, conf. ros. antiq. ana. +o. j. 
and in great necessity we haue vsed to giue the patient Aqua composita, 
or of Master Kebles water published in the end of this booke, applying 
continually to the bottome of his belly, hot trenchers well wrapped in 
warme double clothes, and also put a double hot cloth to his fundament, 
hauing prepared in readines a close stoole, vnder the which yee shall set a 
pan or pot with hot water, wherein shall be boiled these herbes following,

Boile these in a sufficient quantity of water, & whilest he sitteth at 
the stoole, let his bed be new made and warmed with a warming pan, 
and take heed of cold in any wise, &c. And thus briefly I co~clude this part. 
Next I will set downe the best approoued vnctions, that my selfe haue 
knowen in all the time of my practise for many yeeres, with other remedies, 
which I haue also found to be very profitable helpes for the cure of 
this sicknesse, and then with as much breuity as I can, I will conclude 
this order of cure, &c. 
 
[}Of the nature and properties of Quicksiluer, with the 
excellent vertues of the same. 
Cap. 7.}] 
 
I Haue thought it most meete and conuenient, for 
the better vnderstanding of all yoong students in 
Chirurgerie, briefly to set downe the nature and 
propertie of Quicksiluer, with the singular vertues 
of the same, &c. Nicholas Massa in his booke 
de Morbo Gallico affirmeth, that quicksiluer is 
hot and moist, and that the nature of quicksiluer 
is to penetrate, dissolue, and prouoke sweate and 
fluxes at the mouth and fundament, &c. Of the 
contrarie opinion is Auicen, saying that it is cold in the second degree: 
and to prooue his opinion to be good, he citeth an historie of an Ape, which 
[/38./] 
did drinke quicksiluer, and so died, by reason thereof the body was dissected, 
and there was found besides the hart, a great quantitie of congealed 
blood, which did arise (say they) of no other cause, but onely of the coldnes 
of the quicksiluer. But Marianus Sanctus Barolitanus saith, he saw a woman, 
which for certaine griefes and diseases, tooke halfe a pound of 
quicksiluer at many times, which she auoided at hir belly without any 
hurt. Ambrose Pare noteth very well an history of an Apothecarie, 
which to stay the thirst of his feuer, tooke a vessell full of quicksiluer, 
thinking it had been water, and within a few howers died, he auoiding 
[^p.169^] 
great quantitie of the quicksiluer by the fundament: and after that he 
was opened, theree was found in his stomacke a pound: and besides this 
there was likewise found congealed blood: and this is by some obiected 
and alleged onely to prooue the coldnes of quicksiluer. But these arguments 
and reasons I thought to be very weake and of no force. For Antonius 
Musa approoueth it good, and to be a most singular and safe remedie 
to be giuen to yoong children, hauing tender and delicate bodies, for 
the cure of wormes in their bodies, being a most dangerous and deadly 
maladie. Almanor a learned doctor of physicke saith, that quicksiluer is 
hot, and by his heate doth warme and make thin the humors being 
well prepared, and doth expell them by the vppermost and outwarde 
parts of the body. Paulus also doth affirme it to be hot and moist in the 
fourth degree, to whose opinion the said Almanor agreeth, and is wholy 
against Auicen, who maketh it cold in the second degree. Also a note deliuered 
vnto me by a friend, of the nature and qualitie of quicksiluer, according 
to the minde of Paracelsus, in his booke called Congere, where he 
writeth De transmutatione Metallorum, saith he: "They that iudge 
quicksiluer to be cold and moist of nature are deceiued, and conuinced by 
their owne error, for naturally it is hot and moist: for that maketh it to 
continue in his flowing and liquidnes: for if it were cold and moist, it 
[/39./] 
would alwaies haue forme of congealed water, as ice, and would be 
hard and solid: besides that it would require fire to melt it as other mettals 
do, which it doth not, but floweth of his naturall heate, &c." Many 
men are of many opinions, and allege great reasons to prooue quicksiluer 
to be cold. But it falleth out, that common experience prooueth the 
contrarie. For this my selfe doth know most assuredly, that quicksiluer 
being compounded with Axungia porcina, vnguentum Dialthææ, vulpinum, 
Aregon, Agrippæ, Genistæ, also Oleum laurinu~, Terebinthinæ, 
Liliorum, Chamæmelinum, Anethinum, Rosaceum, Lumbricorum, & 
Hyperici, &c. and such other emolliant and dissoluing remedies. By 
these meanes I haue resolued nodes and hard swellings, with great 
comfort vnto the parts affected, and so haue cured many, though the 
griefe were old and of long continuance: and may be performed of any, 
being (as I haue said) artificially handled, otherwise it is as a sword put 
into a mad mans hand. But I do truly affirme, that quicksiluer is most 
profitable for the cure of Lues Venerea, being as it were first mortified 
& killed with Succus Limonum, succus saluiæ, succus ros. Oleum laurinum, 
iuniperi, axungia porcina, acetum vini, aqua vitæ, sputum hominis 
ieiun. oxymel. squilliticum, &c. Thus I say, quicksiluer being 
sufficiently killed, may then be compounded with the foresaid vnguents 
and oiles, and other gums and powders, as heerafter in the composition 
[^p.170^] 
of the vnctions shall be declared. Then shall you finde that the vnctions 
made with quicksiluer haue great and precious vertues, and it is most 
true that their opinions ought not to be regarded, which speake so maliciously 
against the vnctions made with quicksiluer, onely of enuie, to the 
intent to make this maner of curing seeme odious vnto the world. But 
for my part, without further obiections to the contrarie, let euery man 
speake and iudge according as he knoweth and findeth: and this I say 
most truly, that I yet did neuer see, but that the profit surmounted the 
hurt, being diligently and carefully vsed, then I suppose no man was 
yet euer endamaged thereby, if they speake truly: and so I conclude 
with the sayings of Vigo, that I know no reason why some men should 
thus condemne medicines made with quicksiluer, seeing that many remedies 
made with quicksiluer (being so noble a thing as it is) are found 
in the books of ancient and late writers, in the curing of scabs, salt fleam, 
tetters and ring wormes, &c. But it is said, the cause why they are so 
headstrong in opinion, or as it were sworne enimies against vnctions 
made with quicksiluer, truly this is one of their chiefe reasons, to prooue 
their opinion to be good. First they say they be very dangerous & strong, 
and so cause malignant accidents, and vlcerations in the mouth and 
gums, toong and throte, with continuall fluxe of flegmatike matter day 
and night running, whereby happeneth painfull watching, lacke of appetite, 
with dolour in the iawes, and such other infirmities, which they 
say is so true, that nothing can be more true. It is answered by the authoritie 
of Hippocrates, that extreme remedies are to be vsed against 
extreme diseases: for (say they) be there not purgations made very 
strong, by reason of Eleborus and Scammony, and such like, which hurt 
the stomacke and other parts, and shall they vtterly be refused, bicause 
they are noisome? It is supposed not, for by their contraries they are 
and may be made medicinable: euen the same and the very like prooues 
are there of the vnctions made with quicksiluer. I know full well, it 
will be obiected against me, as it hath beene against others that were 
men of great learning and iudgement, that my learning and knowledge 
heerin, is not to be compared with those men, which hold the contrarie 
opinion, I grant it to be true, and I would indeede hold their opinions 
to be good also, but that daily experience hath taught me to the contrarie. 
And I say with Guido, we be children sitting in the necke of a giant, by 
which meanes we can see whatsoeuer the giant can see. And thus haue I 
obserued and often approoued, that the nature and propertie of the vnctions 
made with quicksiluer, doth prouoke sweate, and emptieth the 
cause of this disease, somtimes sensible and somtimes insensible, and the 
blood is thereby purged from infection, and all the parts of the body are 
[^p.171^] 
clensed from superfluous humors, so that good humors in their places are 
bred, and they do returne againe vnto their naturall course and disposition, 
as we daily find true by experience. But yet beware that too litle of 
the vnction do not deceiue thee in annointing, neither be too bold with 
the applying of too much of it at a time. Also you must obserue that your 
frictions or rubbings be done according to the discretion of the skilfull 
Surgeon and strength of the patient, that is to say moderately, and not 
too forcibly or ouer roughly, for feare of shutting of the pores, neither too 
mildly or gently, but in a reasonable meane: for otherwise it will not 
sufficiently pearse or enter the pores of the skin. Likewise (as I haue 
before said) beware of the disordered patient, and of the aire, of meates 
and of drinks: for by such meanes many haue beene defrauded of their 
healths, and after few daies haue fallen againe into this sicknes, and 
somtimes ioined with a woorse, and more hard to be cured, as the dropsie, 
&c. There is no certaine time to be limited for the number of the 
daies, in the applying of the vnction, neither how much in quantitie 
thereof is to be vsed at a time, but it is necessarie to proceede after the 
strength of the patient, and the force of the vnction, and the continuance 
of the sickenes. These obseruations being skilfully accomplished, and all 
things aforesaid diligently noted, the mouth and gums healed, and the 
teeth fastened, then let the patient haue cleane and fresh clothes, as before 
I haue admonished, and likewise change their sheetes, and not before, 
except the flux do flow too abundantly. Last of all let them be purged 
with some conuenient purgation, meete to purge away the relicts 
remaining of the disease. This done, let the patient be let blood within a 
day or two, and choose some good sweete aire to remaine in for a space, 
vsing a moderate order of diet with conuenient meats and drinks, &c. 
 
[}A note or obseruation of certaine speciall cures of this 
disease, called Lues Venerea, by vnctions and 
other approoued remedies, as followeth. 
Cap. 8.}] 
 
FRiendly Reader, I haue thought it not amisse, for 
the warrantise of this maner of cure, and credit 
of this booke, to set downe certaine speciall cures 
performed by me, according to the order of this 
booke. In the yeere of our Lord 1579. the seuenth 
of Aprill, was brought vnto me, a man of the age 
of twentie and six yeeres, greeuously ouergrowne 
with this sicknesse aforenamed, wherewith he 
[^p.172^] 
had beene infected for the space of fiue yeeres, he had vpon his head a 
mightie great node, which did corrupt the bones through both the 
tables, his throte and the roofe of his mouth was deepely infected 
and eaten with euill vlcers of harde curation, in such sort, that his 
drinke did come oftentimes out of his nose. He had Tophos and painful 
hard swellings vpon his legs and armes, so that the two great bones of 
both his legs, commonly called the shin bones, were with the malice of 
this sicknesse corrupted and eaten very deepely in certaine places, so 
that they were for the most part taken away: he had also vpon his brest 
a very great node, and extreme aches in his ioints, which depriued him 
of his sleepe, and weakned him very much. This seemed to me so hard a 
cure, that I would not make them any warrantise or promise of his recouery: 
but it was the first thing they demanded at my hande, to warrant 
the cure, and likewise would needes know of me, by what day I 
could cure him: vnto whose vnreasonable demands and requests, I answered 
and said, it was not in me to performe, nor in any other person 
whatsoeuer: for I sawe that the cure would be troublesome and dangerous 
vnto the patient, and also great trauell vnto me, and for that his 
sicknes was great and of continuance, and in a body feeble, and of an ill 
constitution. Notwithstanding, I promised to do the best I could, so far 
as reason and experience would lead me: so he was well contented to 
yeeld himselfe into my hands, and I being not altogither in despaire of 
his recouerie, for as much as oftentimes we do see, that beyond all expectation 
very hard and desperate cures are accomplished and brought 
to perfect health, &c. But now to speake againe of this cure, which I 
performed in this order following, 
 
First, hauing prouided for him a conuenient lodging, then I did giue 
him euery morning for six daies togither, this preparatiue, the which I 
haue also described before in Cap. 3.

This done, I gaue him the seuenth day, at seauen of the clocke in the 
morning, this potion following, which did worke woonderfull well, and 
little offended his stomacke, neither greatly troubled his bodie in the 
working.

his bodie was thus prepared and purged, two daies after I tooke from 
him seuen ounces of blood from the liuer veine of the right arme, that is 
to say, by reason of his weaknesse, fower ounces in the morning, and 
three ounces at fower a clocke in the afternoone, which blood looked like 
vnto the colour of glasse, and somwhat thicke and slimy, like vnto a mucilage. 
This also done, I prepared for him to drinke morning and euening, 
this purging drinke following, +o. vj. at a time, being warmed, and 
I so continued it six weekes, only somtimes in the weeke staied a day and 
somtimes two, without taking any of it, and somtimes he tooke it but 
once a day, as it wrought with him more or lesse. By this drinke and the 
meanes aforesaid, the malicious humors, which before did continually 
flow into the parts of the body, and greatly tormented and vexed the patient, 
were (I say) very much diminished, and that did agree very well 
with him, and did nothing offend his stomacke, and it furthered greatly 
the cure, whilest the vlcers were in clensing, and the corrupt bones in 
scaling. The order of making this decoction is thus,

This was boiled vpon an easie fire of coles, till the third part was 
consumed, and in the cooling was put in of fine Mithridate +o. +s. and so I 
strained it: ye shall note that in bodies of a hot constitution, there was 
left out the Mithridate. I did vse this drinke vntill I had remooued all 
the corrupt bones, and clensed the foule and filthy vlcers. Onely ye shall 
further obserue, that when he purged too much, we left off the vse of this 
drinke, according as I haue before declared, more or lesse as we saw good 
occasion. All things being orderly performed, then I did apply vnto certaine 
knots and hard swellings, being laide vpon diuers parts of his 
bodie, this plaister following,

And aboue the bones which were corrupted, I did lay round about 
the sound parts this defensiue,

Hauing applied this defensiue round about the corrupt and hard 
swelling, then I laid vpon euery node, the white causticke or ruptorie, 
which I did spread on lint very thicke, and thus with defending, conuenient 
rowling and bolstering, I bound it thereto, the which causticke 
continued in working the space of fower or fiue houres: then with all 
speede I did hasten the fall of the eschars, with this vnguent,

Let all these rest togither the space of seuen daies, and then boile all 
togither vntill the wine be consumed, and then straine it, and keepe it in 
a cleane vessell: when I had herewith remooued the eschars, and discouered 
the corrupt and rotten bones: I did then euery day after dresse 
those greeued parts with hot Vnguentum Ægyptiacum, which did not 
onely helpe greatly to scale the corrupt and rotten bones, but also did 
subdue and take away the spungeous flesh, which continually did rise in 
these vncleane vlcers, and it did moreouer correct the malice, and consume 
filthy humors, which did continually flow to the vlcered parts, and 
I found much profit in the scaling of the bones with this medicine: but 
you must defend the fleshy and rawe parts specially in delicate and tender 
bodies,
