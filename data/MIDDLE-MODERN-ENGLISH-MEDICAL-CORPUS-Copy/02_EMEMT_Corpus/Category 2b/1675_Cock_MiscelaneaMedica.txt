[}Miscelanea Medica: 
OR, A 
SUPPLEMENT 
TO 
Kitchin-Physick. 
The Second Part.}] 
 
ALL Physicians whom we 
ought most to confide 
in, do conclude and 
have determined it as a most 
undoubted Truth, to cure with 
[^p.2^] 
contraries, and preserve with 
Cordials, according to that 
confirm'd Aphorism of contraria 
contrariis curantur: Similia similibus, 
conservantur. 
 
Paracelsus, Theophrastus, Bombastus, 
Van-Helmont, and some 
of their late conceited Disciples, 
without taking any notice 
of this distinction, do morbum 
morbo curare: and venture to 
attempt the putting out of fire 
with fire: Or, curing hot Diseases 
with hot Medicines, and 
consequently cold Diseases with 
cold. Hippocrates, Galen, and 
their more aged Off-spring; on 
the other hand judge it more 
reasonable and practicable to 
put out fire with water; and 
to subdue the cold effects of 
water, by heat or fire: and to 
this end, if the Disease be hot 
and dry, as a Fever, they advise 
[^p.3^] 
such Food and Physick, as 
is cold and moist; and hot and 
dry Meats and Medicines to 
subdue a disease that is moist 
and cold; never neglecting (as 
is supposed by the Chymist) to 
supply Nature, though not the 
Disease, with convenient, delightful, 
and proper Cordials, 
always remembring, not to nourish, 
but to oppose a Disease, 
with things that remove, or alter 
it by their qualities. 
 
We are much beholden to 
the temperament and qualities 
of things, for the preservation 
of our health, and curing Diseases, 
nor is there, through the 
benignity and bounty of God, 
any accident or distemper, but 
hath its remedy assigned it, by 
the matter, form, temperament 
or qualities of Medicines, knew 
we but certainly how, and when 
[^p.4^] 
to apply them: and therefore 
it is,the Physiology, and all the 
five parts of Physick, are more 
absolutely necessary, than the 
most exalted, and accurate 
Medicines of the Chymist: and 
though by some (who know 
the vulgar neither do, nor will 
know any thing but what is 
vulgar) the Galenist and Chymist 
are represented, as two 
distinct, different and inconsistent 
things, yet 'tis certain, 
they both serve but to make up 
one intire Artist: And I could 
tell you Eugenius not only of 
some Physicians, but some also 
of your own profession, that 
can compare, if not out-do the 
greatest Don and Heroes (as 
they think themselves) of the 
Chymical and Hermetick Sect: 
And because you may depend 
upon it for a Truth, that all 
[^p.5^] 
Diseases and Remedies, may as 
well and better be comprehended 
under some of the simple 
or compound Qualities, 
than any other invented Idea, 
Name or Notion whatever 
of the conceited Chymist, to 
this very end, the foregoing 
Chapters in the first Part, have 
given you a practical account 
of such things, as do preserve 
by their agreement with Nature, 
and cure by their contrariety to 
the Disease; and not to advise 
people to a Diet, that is answerable 
to their Disease and 
Physick they are prescribed, is 
to ruine them: nor are they 
by any but conceited Practitioners 
and Humorists, to be left 
at large, to feed as they think 
fit on old Cheese, Red-herring, 
or to inflame themselves with 
the more subtil and penetrating 
[^p.6^] 
Spirits of Brandy, Punch and 
Aqua Vitæ, which, though at 
first they seem to content Nature, 
and exalt the Archeus, or 
vital and natural heat of our 
bodies, yet they so alter also the 
natural tone, temper and ferments 
of the pancreas, blood 
and stomach, that (in a little 
time) they leave them languid, 
faint and vappid: By these 
things the Chymist may for a 
while, seemingly make his Archeus 
or Nature blaze the better; 
but (like a Torch with 
often beating) it will certainly 
burn out the sooner: and 'tis 
rare to find any accustomed 
Brandy, or Aqua vitæ Bubber, 
when once sick ever to recover, 
because the frequent use of 
such things, make all other Cordials 
useless and invalid in time 
of sickness, and when Nature 
[^p.7^] 
should stand most in need of 
them. Besides, they either at 
first so inflame the vital Spirits, 
as to produce such acute, sharp, 
and sudden Diseases, as Fevers, 
Apoplexies, and the like, or else 
in time (as one fire puts out another) 
they extinguish the 
vital heat and moisture, and 
thereby occasion such chronick 
and fatal Diseases, as Gouts, 
Dropsies, Palsies, Hecticks, 
Scorbuts, Consumptions, and 
death it self. 
 
In short, our blood and spirits 
may as well be too much agitated 
as idle, and the volatil 
Salts may stand in as much 
need of fixing, as the fixed Salts 
of volatizing, nor is their less 
danger in one than the other: 
and how the Chymist, only 
with his hot fiery Cordial Spirits 
at one and the same time, can 
[^p.8^] 
serve two such different Masters, 
I understand not, and 
must herein submit to better 
judgements than my own, and 
surely, such a modest and mannerly 
condescention, as this 
would have better become 
Mempsis, than an unmanly disdaining 
others to magnifie himself; 
nothing being more intolerable 
and base, than inurbanity: 
Nor can I but wonder 
with what confidence he can 
pretend (as he does, page 187) 
to subdue the irregular passions, 
and reform the sinful inclinations 
of others by his Medicines, 
when, after so many thousand 
Doses, as he says he has taken 
himself, (only to animate others) 
as yet he has not conquer'd his 
own: his prevaricating in this 
is enough on all occasions, to 
call in question his integrity, 
[^p.9^] 
and to make him suspected a- 
Chymist: Nor are we so much 
to confide in the loud Hyperbolies 
of his Medicines, and great 
brags that are daily made of 
Pantamagogons, Alexi-stomachons, 
& c. As to some few well 
digested institutions, that may 
practically relate to the six 
non-Naturals, and a Directory 
for Diet. 
 
Like Food, like Flesh, like 
Meat, like Medicine, was once 
almost grown proverbial: and 
some old Philosophers, by the 
continual succession of new matter 
by Aliments; have not only 
affirmed; that from sick men 
we may become sound men: 
but of late the Chymists have 
so improv'd, and advanced the 
Notion in behalf of their Ætherial, 
and supernatural Spirits, 
that we may (say they) 
[^p.10^] 
also become new men; and one 
of the best and most accomplish'd 
of the Chymical Cabal 
(meaning Mempsis) has undertaken 
(on condition his Majesty 
will be gracious to that profession) 
not only to cure his 
Subjects of Incontinency, Atheism, 
Profaneness, and all 
manner of Sin and Debauchery: 
But will make them also 
Just, Devout, Loyal and Religious, 
only by cokesing, tameing, 
and tickling the Archeus 
with his Hermetick and Chymical 
preparations: and to gratifie 
farther, his sacred royal Master 
for so great a kindness he 
engages (to use his own words, 
pag. 187. of his [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
by the powerful operation of 
his [^GREEK OMITTED^] (i. e. in plain English 
his profound skill in Physick) 
to convert Quakers, Catabaptists, 
[^p.11^] 
Independents, Separatists, 
Schismaticks & the multitude of 
Phanaticks to the Church of England. 
Do this, & thou shalt have 
my consent, not only to be honest 
George, Doctor George, and 
George the Doctor: But Sir George, 
St. George, and George the Saint. 
 
But in good earnest I wish, 
dear Doctor, thou hadst conceil'd 
the Divine and Moral 
operations of thy Medicines, 
upon the hearts and confciences 
of poor Mortals, because In these 
his Majesties Dominions thou 
canst now never more hope for 
any practice and employ as a 
Medicaster: for surely the profane 
Cavalier he'l not meddle 
with thee, for fear of being 
made a Schismatick, a religious 
Rebel or Round-head: Nor 
will I'm sure the devout Phanatick, 
for fear of being damn'd 
[^p.12^] 
for an Atheist, a debauch'd and 
honest Royalist: now then or 
never recant, and own the Doctrine 
of Contrarities: now, 
now or never is the time to 
make it appear and convince 
the ignorant Heretical, Reprobate, 
and unconverted Galenist, 
that thy Chymical and Hermetick 
Physick, can at one and 
the same time work such contrary 
effects, as to make the 
Serpent (thy self dear Doctor) 
a Saint; a Royalist, a Roundhead, 
and a Rebel a Royalist; 
Now I say is the time, the very 
time for thee, O Mempsis, to work 
these wonders; or else, (with 
pity and compassion I speak it) 
thou must, I, thou must pack up, 
and be gone into some of those 
horrid regions, where people 
are neither for God nor the 
King; for King nor Parliment, 
[^p.13^] 
no, nor for my Lord Mayor, nor 
Common-council. 
 
I wish also, that the Doctor 
had not intimated, and suggested 
to his Majesty that in good 
conscience (for the good service 
he has done himself, and Royal 
Father of blessed Memory) he 
ought, or can do no less than overthrow, 
or at least new Model, 
and purge with his reforming 
Physick, his College of Physicians, 
and two famous Univerties, 
Cambridge and Oxford. 
 
But above all things, after all 
thy glorious boasts and brags 
of Loyalty, thou wert bewitch'd 
to petition the Parliament 
for no less (in effect) than 
his Majesties; there own, and 
the peoples lives and liberties: 
for what difference is there betwixt 
their being ruin'd, and 
their erecting a College for Mempsis, 
[^p.14^] 
with immunities for him, 
his Heirs and Assigns to dispense 
all the Medicines, that 
must be made use of in his Majesties 
Dominions. 
 
This George, however reasonable, 
and necessary it seems 
to thy self; yet, after thou hast 
fluttered a little longer like a 
Feather in the wind, thou wilt 
find that the Parliament will 
let thee drop, and take no more 
notice of thy Phanatic Freeks 
and frisking Seminalities of thy 
brain, than if a Tom-tit-mous, 
an Owl, or a Jack-daw had 
flown over Westminster. Let 
Wisdom baul, and utter her 
voice never so loud: let her 
scream and tear her throat in 
pieces; 'tis (as thou sayst George) 
all one, as if thou shouldst vociferate 
Neptune to forbear 
swallowing up Ships, since 'tis 
[^p.15^] 
his Nature to do such dirty and 
mischievous tricks: All which 
the Lord Mayor, and Court of 
Aldermen taking into their consideration, 
and that there's no 
hope, that either the King or 
Parliament will accommodate 
thee with a College; our Senators 
and City Heroes are at 
this time preparing one for 
thee at Moor-gate. 
 
And now, seeing he is so 
hardly dealt with; let his Majesty, 
his two Houses, his Nobility 
and Gentry; the Bishops 
and Clergy; the Lawyers and 
Laity; the whole City, Town 
and Country look to it as they 
will, 'tis to be feared, that whatever 
Chymick and Hermetick 
Physick can do, shall be done 
the have the same effects on them 
as on himself: and (if Heaven 
helps not) convert them all to 
[^p.16^] 
non-conformity, faction and sedition. 
 
This zealous Mempsis in another 
place of his Evangelium 
Chymicum (for all he says is 
Gospel) has a hymn to his 
Creator (and by the way let 
me solemnly tell him, I wonder 
how he dare concern so great 
a God! in his little designs) 
for putting it into the hearts 
of rusticks and Mariners, with 
their Punch, Brandy and Aqua 
vitæ bottles, to teach sottish 
Galenists, the use and excellencies 
of his well distilled 
Spirits, and the foolery of their 
dull Julips, fulsom and fruitless 
Apozems, Bochets, Cullices 
and Gellies, as you may read 
at large in several Paragraphs 
and Pages of his Book. 
 
But to leave these extravagancies, 
and flurts of the Hypocondres: 
[^p.17^] 
Lets hear what Galen 
upon Hippocrates says concerning 
this affair of Aliments: 
" This grave Philosopher in his 
" Book De Elementis, tells us, 
" that by a dissent of the first 
" qualities (not from the Punctum 
" latens, the little Atoms 
" in the Archeus, and Seminal 
" Idæas in the Materia prima, as 
our inspired Mempsis will have 
it) but from the dissent of these 
first Qualities, says our Author, 
which proceeds immediately 
from the Elements themselves, 
and the Aliments; man is born 
for the Physician, and were it 
not for the defects proceeding 
from these two, man could never 
dye. 
 
From the four Elements, 
come the four Qualities of heat, 
cold, driness and moisture: 
from these arise the temperaments 
[^p.18^] 
of Aliments; and 
from our Aliments, come the 
four humours, call'd Choler, 
Phlegm, Blood and Melancholy; 
and out of these humours 
the parts; and from those parts 
the whole, or what we call a 
humane body: and when any 
of these four temperaments or 
humours are extinct, deprav'd 
or hurt in Quantity, Quality, 
or Motion, then follows Sickness 
and Death: So that in 
effect, Life and Death, and every 
mans temper and constitution, 
depends more or less upon 
the aliments he feeds on; 
and the humours themselves 
are nothing more than the effect 
of food, v..g Choler is the 
fomes of blood made of Aliments 
over digested and concocted, 
and serves to ferment, 
agitate, or brisk up the constipated 
[^p.19^] 
Ideas of the Archeus. 
Flegm is made of Food, (for 
want of natural heat) not enough 
concocted, and bridles 
choler, and keeps the blood 
and humours from burninig, 
tames, and fixes the Spirits, 
and makes the body, cool, fat, 
moist and soluble. Blood is made 
of Food, perfectly elaborated 
to augment and nourish the 
parts: good Food makes good 
Blood; and good Blood makes 
good Flesh: So that in effect, 
Flesh and Blood is only good 
Food. Melancholy is the Terra 
damnata: the Devil, the 
thick and drossie part of Food 
and Blood; and was intended 
by Nature to bridle the [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
the fomes or froth of 
sperm and spirits; to temper 
rage and lust, to compose the 
thoughts and imaginations: 
[^p.20^] 
but being deprav'd, it works 
contrary effects, as we see in 
our friend Mempsis. 
 
From this little representation 
of man, an intelligent, and 
considering person may find out 
as easily, as by the Idæas, Atomes, 
or Magots in the Archeus, how 
we come by Diseases, our dissolution 
and death; and also 
how necessary, a direct and 
due diet, such a diet as may 
answer to the four temperaments, 
and humours of our 
bodies, choler, phlegm, blood, 
and Melancholy: how necessary 
this (I say) is for the preventing, 
and curing Diseases; 
as might be farther amplified, 
but that I must avoid prolixity, 
that the Book may not be too 
chargeable for the poor: Or 
else it might be made evident, 
that a diet may be collected, 
[^p.21^] 
not only to heat, cool, dry and 
moisten, but also to 
 
[^A table is here represented in tab-delimited format.^] 
Bind 	Thicken 	Lenifie 
Relax 	Thin 	Revel 
Restore 	Deobstruate 	Resist Poyson 
[^End of the table.^] 
 
And all things else, that 
Pharmacy it self can necessarily 
lay claim to, towards 
the conservation of 
man. But this will not 
consist with a short essay, 
and therefore as concisely, 
as the subject will permit, 
I shall only add a description 
of the Nature, Use and 
Vertues of an Artificial 
[^p.22^] 
Bath, and stove hereunto 
annex'd; with which, 
our Ambrosiopæas, and a 
proper Diet may be performed 
as much as can reasonably 
be expected from 
the means. 
 
What a help it is to Nature, 
to throw off by sweat 
those saline, acid, sulphureous, 
and corrosive particles 
of blood, which are the 
root of all Diseases, is 
manifested by the daily 
experience of such as are 
daily relieved by it, in 
Gouts, Scorbuts, Hecticks, 
the Evil, Palsies, and the 
[^p.23^] 
like: as it helps thus to 
discharge the Serum Salsum, 
the salt, sharp and 
watery parts of blood by 
the skin; how far this, I 
say, may extend it self, 
both for the preventing 
and curing many potent 
Diseases, when Diet and 
other Remedies are deficient, 
and cannot do 
it, I leave to the bounty 
of a prudent and liberal 
conception. 
 
It is so contriv'd that 
'tis impossible for the patient 
to take cold, to faint 
or sweat beyond their 
[^p.24^] 
strength, and own inclinations; 
nor is there any 
nuissance in it, that is indicent 
to Stoving, or sweating 
in other Baths. 
 
Place here the figure.

Catarrhs, Lethargies, Phrensies, or Madness, &c. 
 
All that the Patient is to do, is onely at night when they go to bed, for 
about a quarter of an hour, to receive (as the part is affected) the Vapour that 
comes out of the Instrument, According as the Vehicle is prepar'd; 'tis also a 
great Antidote against the Plague, malignant Feavers, Small Pox, Measles, and 
all contagious Diseases, and of absolute use, not onely for sick People, but such 
also as live in the House, and tend them; or are necessiated to take their diseased 
Reekes, and dying Breaths. 
 
[^p.25^] 
[}AN 
APPENDIX: 
OR 
Practical Cautions 
AND 
DIRECTIONS 
To be observed about 
STOVING 
AND 
BATHING.}] 
 
STtoving and Bathing 
are two different 
things: the first may not 
improperly be call'd a dry 
Bath, the other a wet; and 
[^p.26^] 
when ever you meet with 
the word Bath, you are to 
understand sweating in 
something that is liquid, as 
luke-warm Milk, Milk 
and Water, or only warm 
water, or water prepared 
with ingredients proper 
for the diseased person. 
 
Note also, that a Bath 
with very hot water, drys 
more than it moistens, and 
contracts the skin and 
pores, rather than relax or 
open them; and serves to 
supply the intention of a 
cold Bath; or bathing in 
cold water with such parts 
& persons, as cannot safely 
go into cold water: But a 
[^p.27^] 
Bath of heated, tepid, or 
warm water, is of so great a 
latitude, that it extends it 
self to most Diseases, and 
serves (to use the words of 
a learned Author on this 
subject, Dr. J. F.) effectually 
more than any thing 
Physick is prescribed for, 
to defecate the blood and 
humours, to mollifie the 
hardness of the Spleen and 
bowels, to moisten, cool, 
and nourish a hot and dry 
constitution and liver, to 
rarifie and resolve also all 
cold congealed humours, 
and to prevent Barrenness 
and miscarrying, that is occasioned 
by any intemperies 
[^p.28^] 
of cold, heat or dryness. 
 
When you meet with 
the word Stove, you are to 
understand sweating as in 
a Hot-house, without any 
thing that is moist and liquid: 
You will also sometimes 
find the word Vaporarium 
used in this Appendix, 
the meaning of 
which will be known hereafter. 
 
The Romans were most 
addicted to Bains or Baths; 
the Lacedemonians, Russians, 
Germans, and most 
Northern Nations to Stoves: 
The Turks, French and Italians, 
use both Baths and 
[^p.29^] 
Stoves: and as soon as they 
come out of the Stove, 
they enter into a Bain or 
Bath of warm water, to 
wash away the recrements, 
slime, mador or mud (as it 
were) that stoving without 
bathing is apt to leave 
upon the skin. 
 
By this means also, the 
skin is not only made pure, 
clean and smooth, but also 
plump and fleshy: and 
according as the Bath may 
be dulcified and prepared, 
it will nourish, feed and 
refresh the limbs and musculous 
parts, more than 
food: nor is there any 
thing to be done by the 
[^p.30^] 
natural Baths at Bathe, but 
may be also performed by 
artificial Baths of Sulphur, 
Bitumen, Nitre, & c. and 
being advisedly used, they 
do as manifestly answer 
the expectation of the patient, 
as any remedies 
whatever; in order to 
which observe these few 
Directions. 
 
1. Never Stove when 
the blood wants ferment, 
or (according to the Notion 
of the Chymist) when 
the fixed salts of the blood 
have over-ruled the volatil, 
as in Dropsies, and some 
sorts of Scurvies: But when 
the Sulphur of the blood 
[^p.31^] 
is too much exalted (the 
fomes of most acute diseases) 
or acrimony and acidity 
has insinuated it self 
into the Mass, and yet the 
blood not vapid, then the 
Stove is a proper, and most 
effectual remedy: Or, more 
plainly, according to the 
significant, apparent, and 
practical meaning of the 
Galenist; Stoving is not 
so proper and beneficial, 
for weak, lean, hot, hectick, 
dry, cholerick, maciated, 
melancholy and squalid 
bodies, as bathing; nor 
bathing for cold, moist, 
fat, corpulent, plethorick, 
phlegmatick & hydropick 
[^p.32^] 
constitutions and diseases, 
as stoving: The Stove is 
most proper for the Spring, 
Autum and Winter; the 
Bath for the heat of Summer: 
the Vaporarium is 
neither bathing nor stoveing, 
but differing from 
both, and to be used by all 
sorts of persons at any 
time. 
 
2. Before you Bathe, or 
enter into the Stove; if 
your body be not naturally 
soluble, be sure it be 
made so by Art: Take a 
gentle Clyster over night, 
if you intend to sweat next 
morning, or take the like 
Clyster in the afternoon, 
[^p.33^] 
if you intend to sweat at 
night. An hour before 
bed-time, and two or three 
hours after you have eaten 
a light supper, is the 
best time both for bathing 
and stoving, because you 
may lie all night after in 
your bed, and have your 
body well refresh'd and 
settled by morning. Note 
also, that while you are 
sweating in a Stove, Bath 
or Bed, you may refresh 
your self with Mace-ale, 
Egg-caudle, Chicken-broth, 
or any convenient 
Bocheet, supping or liquid 
Aliment. 
 
3. When you come out 
[^p.34^] 
of any Stove or Bath, take 
great care you take not 
cold: For preventing 
which, and many other accidents, 
nothing hath ever 
yet been invented comparable 
to this [^GREEK OMITTED^], Balneum, 
and vaporarium, 
now all in one presented 
to you; which is so safe, 
so commodious and effectual, 
both for preventing 
and curing almost all Diseases, 
that nothing ever 
was, or can be advised 
better, for private Families 
than to have one of 
them constantly in their 
houses; it being so contrived, 
that it may stand in 
[^p.35^] 
any bed-chamber, with as 
much conveniency and ornament, 
as a well wrought 
Chest of Drawers or Cabinet. 
 
In Italy, France, Germany, 
Turkie, and many other 
Countries, they are 
so curious, and (not without 
good cause) so addicted 
to stoving and bathing, 
that they count their habitations 
not compleatly 
furnish'd, and well provided 
and cared for, until 
they have them in their 
houses, esteeming them the 
most commendable and 
necessary furniture that belongs 
to them: and scarce 
[^p.36^] 
a Family of any remark 
and quality is to be found 
without them; and if our 
English Gentry, especially 
those that live in the 
Country, remote from Physicians, 
did also take up 
this custom, they would 
have no cause to repent 
them of their care and consideration: 
Besides, not only 
their healths, but interest 
and good husbandry might 
induce them to it, it being 
the most profitable Physician 
and Apothecary they 
can make use of. 
 
Another benefit of 
having them in their 
houses, is the accommodation 
[^p.37^] 
of their sevants, attendants, 
bedding and linnen, 
and the avoiding many 
accidents by lying, 
bathing or stoving after 
strangers: by this means 
also, they will be encouraged 
to use them the oftner; 
at least 'tis likely it 
will induce them not to 
fail, spring and fall; those 
being (though no time amiss) 
the most necessary 
times to prevent Diseases, 
and preserve their bodies 
in a perfect [^GREEK OMITTED^], health 
and integrity the whole 
year after. 
 
I know, and am well 
assured, that Physicians 
[^p.38^] 
would frequently advise 
their Patients to stoving 
and bathing, had they them 
in their own houses, but 
the charge and trouble on 
all occasions of providing 
them, does too often discourage 
both the Patient 
and Physician. By 
this means also you may avoid 
Spring and Fall, the 
use of Diet-Drinks, Physick-ale, 
and the like, 
which being at those times 
so rashly and promiscuously 
used as they are, do 
more hurt than good. Letting 
blood also in the 
Spring, may by this means 
be prevented, only observing 
[^p.39^] 
then a spare and 
cool Diet, which the Ancients 
call'd their [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
or succedaneum to bloodletting: 
Abstinence rather 
than bleeding being their 
way to abate blood, and 
prevent diseases: and to 
deal uprightly in a matter 
of so great concernment, 
for a preventive, 'tis to be 
preferred before opening 
of a Vein, which I do not 
much fancy, but in cases of 
extreme necessity, and not 
upon every trivial distemper, 
and occasion that offers 
it self: Bood being 
that which makes blood, 
and (as the oyl and lamp 
[^p.40^] 
of life) not prodigally to 
be expended, lest like the 
foolish Virgins we have 
our Oyl to buy, when we 
should have it to burn. 
 
The particular benefits 
of bathing and stoving 
are not easily to be reckoned 
up in a transient discourse, 
but that which they 
are so generally fam'd for, 
is to depurate the bad recrements 
of the blood, the 
lassitude, and lumpishness 
of the limbs, and to make 
the whole body brisk, 
nimble, light and airy. 
 
They prevent and cure 
all Agues, and Fevers of 
all sorts, both ardent, hectick, 
[^p.41^] 
putrid and pestilential; 
and in times of contagion, 
are of absolute use, 
provided the place they 
sweat in (as it commonly 
happeneth) be not infected; 
which (if for nothing 
else) were enough 
to encourage persons to 
have these Stoves in their 
Houses. 
 
And as there is nothing 
more effectual to prevent 
the Plague, than sweating 
moderately in these sorts 
of Stoves, once or twice a 
week: So also, if infected, 
nothing can exceed them 
for a Cure, taking at the 
same time convenient Cordials: 
[^p.42^] 
Nature by a Metastasis, 
being thereby assisted to 
throw off the poyson and 
venom of the blood, from 
the Center, to the remote 
parts of the body, which 
is the only intention of the 
cure, the like is to be said 
of the Small-pox, malignant 
Fevers, and all contagious 
diseases. 
 
It relieves or cures all 
sorts of pains and aches, as 
Sciatica's, Gouts, & c. it 
cures also limbs, that are 
weak and relax'd, and all 
cold, and moist diseases got 
by cold. 
 
Bathing by the mildness 
of its heat, mollifies and 
[^p.43^] 
relaxes, softens & smooths, 
and on this account is very 
proper, and very prevalent 
to cure contracted members, 
and parts obstructed, 
either outward or inward, 
as the breast, spleen, liver. 
 
Bathing also, wonderfully 
relieves and easeth 
Nephritick pains, and such 
as are tortured and troubled 
with the Stone, Cholick 
pains, Hemorrhoids, 
stopping of Urine and 
Courses, and makes a costive 
belly soluble and 
loose. 
 
All diseases of the sinews, 
and all internal diseases 
proceeding from a 
[^p.44^] 
cold and moist cause, are 
prevented & cured by Stoving, 
as Rheumes, Palsies, 
Lethargies, Cramps, Deafness, 
weakness, swelling 
and numbness of the 
joynts: 'tis also a specifick 
against the Kings-Evil 
and Jaundies, Scabs, 
Itch, Chilblains, and all 
efflorescences of the skin. 
In short, it so alters and defecates 
the blood, that you 
may alter as you will by 
them and diet, the whole 
habit of the body, & make 
it another thing than what 
it is; like the ship at Athens, 
though it continued 
still a ship, yet it had not 
[^p.45^] 
by often reparation, one 
foot of the timber it was 
first built with. 
 
And not only sick and 
diseased persons, but such 
as are in health may receive 
profit, but no prejudice in 
the least by them: and my 
ingenuous friend Mr. H. 
H. has told me, that in his 
travels to Russia, Sclavonia, 
and other Eastern parts 
of Europe, he observed that 
in those Countries, it was 
not possible for the inhabitants 
to live (for want of 
ventilation) were it not for 
their Stoves, but by the 
continual and frequent use 
of them, no people are to 
[^p.46^] 
be found more sound and 
healthful; and are thereby 
so little beholden to Physick, 
that the name is scarce 
known among them: and 
not a place of any note, 
but has one in them 
 
So also the Scorbute or 
Scurvy, by often and frequent 
Stoving, is never 
heard of among those people 
(though for want of 
perspiration) they would 
else be inclined to it more 
than we in England. 'Tis 
their only refuge also to 
prevent Fevers, Gouts, 
Palsies, & c. after they have 
debauch'd themselves with 
high drinking, which these 
[^p.47^] 
people, to the great scandal 
of their Country, are 
most infamously addicted 
unto. 
 
Many people, especially 
such as are Hysterick 
and Hypocondriack, by 
Stoving in common Stoves 
and Hot-houses, are subject 
to fumes, head-ach, 
swounings, and suffocating 
vapours: But in this sort 
of Stove, (the head being 
in the open Air, all the 
while they sweat) these 
and many other evil accidents 
are prevented, nor 
are they at all offended 
with any noisome vapours 
or suffocating fumes. 
 
[^p.48^] 
[}The manner of using it is thus.}] 
 
Your body being made soluble 
by some gentle Lenitive or 
Clyster, go naked into the 
Stove; stay in it about half an 
hour more or less to your content, 
or the nature of your 
disease, taking while you sweat 
some comfortable supping, as 
Mace ale, or whatever else may 
be advised by your Physician: 
while you are sweating, you 
may increase or decrease the 
heat your self, and sweat as you 
please; after you have sweat 
to your content, you may have 
the Flammifers, or fire Vessels 
remov'd; and the neck-board 
slided away, and so slip down 
into the wet Bath and there 
wash off the recrements, the 
slime and filth of your former 
sweat, with balls invented for 
[^p.49^] 
that purpose: Then (after you 
have bathed about half an 
hour) stand upon your feet, and 
wipe your body dry, & step out 
of the Bath into a warm Bed, 
and lye warm till your body 
be well settled, and afterwards 
rise, and having taken some 
warm broth, you may go abroad, 
renewed to admiration, 
and sufficiently recompenced 
for what you have done. 
 
That which we call vaporarium, 
is a place in the Stove, 
contriv'd chiefly for diseases of 
the Womb, Anus, and diseases 
of the inferiour belly; as Dysenteries, 
Hemorrhoids, Cancers, 
and fistulated Ulcers, 
Scyrrhous tumours, Barrenness, 
Abortion, Menses, Secundines, 
and every [^GREEK OMITTED^], and 
were it for nothing else but decency 
(Cum vapor per infundibulum 
& fistulam plumbeam, in 
[^p.50^] 
Vterum, vel anum ingrediatur) 
it was enough to induce 
private Familes and persons to 
have one of these Stoves by 
them. 
 
It still remains, that I give 
some account of the Hydroticks 
which feed the Flammifers; 
or how and what it is that 
causeth the patient to sweat; it 
is not caused by any gross material 
fire of wood, coles, & c. as 
the common Chairs and Stoves 
are, but 'tis by an essential 
Oyl, cohibited by retorts with 
well rectified Spirit of Wine; 
and if you have the true exalted, 
and perfect Oyly-spirit so 
well incorporated, and separated 
from its phlegm, as it 
ought, it will penetrate, and 
prove as active as lightning it 
self. 
 
There are some who know 
[^p.51^] 
no better, who do in these cases 
use common Brandy, and our 
poor, mean English Spirits, and 
they succeed in their cures accordingly, 
there being seldom 
any visible or manifest benefit 
received by it: Whereas, 
those mighty and potent diseases, 
of a confirm'd knotted 
Gout, and ulcerated Kings-evil, 
Palsies, and the like, are frequently 
subdued by the Oyly 
spirit rightly prepared, as might 
be made appear, did it not favour 
too much of the Pseudochymist, 
the Mountebank and 
Mechanick. 
 
All that I have else to add, 
being confined to a short Treatise, 
and supposing that after 
the publishing this manner of 
Bathing and Stoving, there will 
be no want of undertakers, 
and such as will pretend to the 
utmost that can be done by it; 
[^p.52^] 
yet, that abuses may be prevented, 
and none but wilful 
people deceived, this is to signifie, 
that the very same preparation 
of Spirits for the 
Flammifers, that produce those 
great effects by sweat, and that 
I use my self, may be had at 
Mr. Briggs an Apothecary, at 
his house by Abb-Church near 
Cannon-street: or in Spittle-fields 
near the Salmon. By the 
help of which Spirit, any that 
have these Stoves of their own, 
may do as much with them towards 
curing themselves, as can 
be done for them, by the most 
mighty hand, and most magnifi'd 
Medicine of a Chymist.

satisfaction on this subject may
