[}General Rules to know under what Planet every Herb or 
Plant is governed by the only use of an Herbal, with 
the true reason thereof, according unto the Author's 
experience and practice for many years; as followeth.}] 
 
THe first thing considerable, is to take notice of the Elemental 
Qualities of each Planet; viz. whether hot and 
dry, hot and moist, cold and dry, or cold and moist and of 
what degrees; as first, second, third or fourth. Secondly, 
we must by an Herbal find the nature or Elemental quality of 
the plants; if you find that both the Planet and plant do accord 
in Elemental qualities then we may conclude, that such 
an herb or plant is under such a Planet: for any reasonable 
Philosopher well knoweth, that every Element doth naturally 
sympathize with its own like, even as the actions of men doth 
naturally sympathize with their complexion and condition of 
that Planet which hath predominancy over them, as I have 
elsewhere expressed. 
 
[}Example [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^]}] 
 
Saturn is a Planet cold and dry in the third and fourth degree: 
Now by the Herbal I find, that hemlock, henbane, 
night-shade, and such like, are cold and dry in the third and 
fourth degree; and therefore may justly be attributed unto 
the Planet Saturn. 
 
[}[^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^]}] 
 
Jupiter is by nature hot and moist: Now by the Herbal I 
find, that burrage, mallows, and the herb or plant called dogstones, 
are by nature hot and moist; and therefore may justly 
be attributed unto Jupiter. 
 
[}[^Symbol of Mars omitted^]}] 
 
Mars is by nature hot and dry in the third and fourth degree: 
Now by the Herbal I find, that carduus, wormwood, 
tobacco, rhubarb, hellebore, box, and such like, are all under 
the dominion of Mars, as being hot and dry in the third and 
fourth degree. 
 
[}[^Symbol of Sun omitted.^]}] 
 
The Sun is by nature hot and dry in the first and second 
degree, and near unto the third: Now by the Herbal I find, 
that angelica, baum, marigolds, rue, sweet marjoram, and 
such like, are all hot and dry in the first and second degree, 
perhaps near unto the third; and therefore are all attributed 
unto the Sun. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}[^Symbol of Venus omitted.^]}] 
 
Venus is by nature cold and moist in the first and second 
degree: Now by the Herbal I find, that violets, spinage, white 
beets, white beans, and such like, are all under the dominion 
of Venus, as being cold and moist in the first and second degree 
accordingly. 
 
[}[^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^]}] 
 
Mercury is by nature cold and dry in the first and second 
degree: Now by the Herbal I find, that endive, succory, 
woodbine, lung-wort, liver-wort, and such like, are all cold 
and dry in the first and second degree, and are therefore under 
the dominion of Mercury. 
 
[}[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]}] 
 
The Moon is by nature cold and moist in the third and 
fourth degree; and by the Herbal I find, that cabbage, sengreen, 
chickweed, orpine, purslain, and such like, are all cold 
and moist in the third and fourth degree; and therefore are 
under the dominion of the Moon. 
 
[}Another way whereby to attribute each herb or plant 
aright unto the Planet, that so _[^ORIG. BLANK^]hey may agree both in 
elemental qualities and virtues, more especially of 
the first part in the degrees of heat or cold, it being 
the way of my practice, and that with good success.}] 
 
FIrst, having by an Herbal found the virtue of the plant 
which is approved for the curing of such infirmities or 
diseases which are under the dominion of such a planet, as 
causes them, although the herb or plant agree but in the first 
elemental quality of heat or cold, yet the herb or plant may 
justly and rationally be attributed unto the Planet which owns 
the grief, and so thereby make a sympathetick cure: As instance, 
Jupiter who is by nature hot and moist, and hath predominancy 
over the liver, lungs, blood, veins, plurisies, and 
the like. Now by the Herbal we find, that lung-wort, wood-bittany, 
agremony, scurvigrass, and such like, are all good to 
cure such infirmities, notwithstanding they are all hot and 
dry in the first and second degree, yet having the first elemental 
quality of heat, together with virtue to cure such defects 
which Jupiter causeth, they may justly be attributed unto 
Jupiter; and so plantane, white beets, and dandelion, accounted 
by Authors cold and dry, may justly be attributed 
unto Venus, as having the first elemental quality of being cold 
in the first or second degree, and hath virtue to cure by sympathy 
[^p.7^] 
such defects which Venus causeth, or otherwise by antipathy 
unto Mars, as doth plantane, which cureth cuts and 
wounds which Mars causeth: Now white beets and dandelion 
cureth by sympathy; the first bringeth down womens courses, 
the other helpeth to cleanse the passages of urin, always 
provided in these particular applications, that the first elemental 
quality of heat or cold doth agree, as aforesaid, without 
which there can be no true gathering or attributing the 
plant aright unto the Planet, as I have shewed more at large 
elsewhere. And farther, should we not sometimes use this 
particular way herein expressed, both Jupiter and Venus, who 
are great friends unto Nature, would have very few herbs or 
plants allotted unto them, especially Jupiter who is the greater 
fortune; for by the Herbal you shall find very few herbs 
or plants which doth accord in elemental qualities of heat 
and moisture with Jupiter; and the truth is, I find that Authors 
do most of them agree in the first elemental quality, or 
part of heat or cold, but in the latter part of drith or moysture 
somewhat differing; and without question they do but 
guess thereat, or otherwise by tradition follow each other; 
neither do they give true knowledge therein (especially in 
many herbs and plants) as instance dandelion, which hath a 
known virtue to open and cleanse the passages of urin: Now 
if this plant were cold and dry, which most Authors hold, 
how could it have this virtue to open and cleanse? for of necessity 
moisture must do it, for all plants which are drying, 
are usually stopping and binding; and so Saturn, a Planet 
cold and dry, when afflicting the [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] in earthy signs, always 
produceth bindings in the body: Also the blossoms of plants 
are somewhat to be regarded, more especially when they agree 
in the first elemental quality of heat or cold; as instance, 
wood-bittany, hyssop, bugloss, burrage, and such like, 
whose blossoms are blew, a colour which [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] owneth: And 
notwithstanding they are all hot and dry (except burrage) 
yet they are rightly appropriated unto Jupiter, by reason of 
their virtues, as curing such defects which [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] causeth. But 
should we grant that herbs and plants, which are by Nature 
cold and dry, to be under Jupiter (as many learned Authors 
do hold as I could name) as instance endive, succory, and 
such like, there can be no reason given for it, by reason they 
are so much differing in elemental qualities, for the plants 
are cold and dry, and the Planet Jupiter hot and moist, clean 
opposite unto each other; wherefore it standeth by reason, 
and is rational to be under Mercury, whose nature doth sympathize, 
as being cold and dry, and so to cure by antipathy 
[^p.8^] 
unto Jupiter, the herbs being of known virtue to cure such 
distempers, which Jupiter causeth; likewise I find that many 
Authors do attribute, clary, mints, peny royal, and many 
others, unto Venus a planet cold and moist, whereas the 
herbs are all hot and dry, of a clean contrary nature. Now 
these plants doe properly belong to the Sun; and the rather 
in regard of their virtues, as being comfortable unto the 
heart and vital spirits, and being of sweet smell and pleasant 
taste: I could instance many more, which Authors do 
wrongfully apply, as instance they attribute angelica, sage, 
box, and such like to be under the planet Saturn whereas 
the herbs are all hot and dry especially box who is hot and 
dry in the fourth degree, both the first plants are without 
question under the dominion of the Sun, as being of a good 
smell and taste and are of known virtues to comfort the 
heart, arteries, and vital spirits and to resist poyson. The 
other being very hot, and of bitter taste rightly belongeth 
unto the planet Mars as agreeing in elemental qualities, I 
confess, I have read many Authors, and I find many of them 
accord, but clean out of the way of truth: The reason is, as 
I conceive, because their works are many, or most of them 
but translated, and so following by tradition each other, not 
well weighing the reasons have likewise erred, but as to the 
virtues of herbs and plants they do for the most part accord, 
giving reasons for the same. What I have written in this Book 
i_[^ORIG. BLANK^] not by imitation of others, but from my own daily practice 
and experience. And should I set down the many, difficult 
cures, which I have done by virtue of herbs I should hardly 
be believed, except by such who are well versed in the secrets 
of Astrology and Philosophy: for many countrey people 
think, they make a bold adventure, when they come unto 
me for cure, presuming that what I do is more than natural. 
They not considering, or at least being ignorant of the extraordinary 
virtue of herbs and plants more especially being 
gathered at the right planetary hours together with the right 
numbers of herbs and plants belonging unto each planet 
being collected and being truely in due times administred; 
for time, virtue and number, together with the right understanding 
of the way of cure by sympathy and antipathy are 
the five principal pillars of our work in the Astrological or 
chymical way of physick, as I have already declared in my before 
Epistle to the Reader. 
 
[^p.9^] 
Here followeth some necessary Rules to be observed 
concerning the gathering of each herb or Plant 
aright according unto the true planetary hours, 
without which no great cures can be done or 
wonders wrought in the Astrological and Chymical 
way of Physick. I have also set down the 
way how to reconcile any difference, which may 
sometimes arise by way of application of the 
plant unto the planet: For I must confesse by 
reason of the difference amongst Herbalists concerning 
the qualities and vertues of some particular 
plants there may happily be some rational contest 
therein. 
 
[}The Way to gather such Herbs and Plants which 
are of known Elemental qualities and virtues 
out of contest is as followeth.}] 
 
BEfore we proceed herein it will be necessary for the Reader 
to understand the planetary hours, which are inserted 
at the beginning of the second Book together with 
the Almanack perpetual adjoyning for both the planet, which 
is Lord of the hour and the plant which is to be gathered 
must both agree in elemental qualities especially of the first 
part of heat or cold. Example, If I were minded to gather 
baum, rosemary, marygolds angelica, and such like plants 
or herbs, which are under the dominion of the Sun; upon 
Sunday the fourteenth of March 1699. Now from the Suns 
rising until he is an hour in highth which is until seven a 
clock, is the hour of the Sun, likewise the Sun reigneth again 
the eighth hour, which is between one and two a clock after 
upon At which times you may gather any herbs or plants 
under the dominion of the Sun. Now if any one were 
minded to gather any herbs of the Sun upon Tuesday the 
sixteenth day then between seven and eight a clock in the 
morning is the hour of the Sun. And likewise between two 
a_[^ORIG. BLANK^]d three a clock afternoon, as appeareth in the Almanack 
answerable unto the day of the Month, also by the same Rules 
you may gather any other Herbs or Plants at the right planetary 
hours accordingly, which are out of controversie. 
 
[^p.10^] 
[}Rules whereby to gather such Herbs and plants, which 
are in Controversie, that so you may have the true 
planetary influence notwithstanding as 
followeth.}] 
 
VVHen you are minded to gather any herb or Plant 
in controversie, as instance dandelion beforementioned, 
this Plant being by my rules under Venus, but by 
some Autho_[^ORIG. BLANK^]s appropriated unto Jupiter by reason it hath 
a virtue to open the obstructions of the Liver (being under 
Jupiter) But it hath also a virtue to open and cleanse the 
passages of urine, as I have already declared (which is under 
Venus) but chiefly it hath the first elemental quality of 
being cold, agreeing with Venus, whereas Jupiter is hot. 
Now to reconcile this or any other difference of the like 
nature, do as followeth; Let both Planets in question at the 
time of gathering be in Conjunction, Sextile or Trine, aspect unto 
each other. Or otherwise let the Moon be seperating and 
applying by any of those aspects from the one planet to the 
othe_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], by this rule yon may have the true planetary influence 
of both planets in question: Alwayes provided that the Lord 
of the Hour doth accord with the first elemental quality of 
the planet be it hor or cold, wherefore in this condition Venus 
must be Lord of the Hour at the time of gathering the 
herb or plant accordingly. I shall instance one herb more; 
Suppose, I was minded to gather Sweet-marjerome, which 
plant is by many Authors appropriated unto the planet Mercury, 
the reason they give is because Mercury is conjoyned in 
some particular operations of the brain, and this plant is of 
known virtue to comfort the brain. But by my rules and dayly 
experience, I find it to be under the dominion of the sun; 
First by reason of its elemental qualities as agreeing with 
heat and drith: Secondly in regard of its virtues, for all herbs 
and plants, which are of sweet smell, and are of approved 
virtues to comfort the heart, brain, nerves and arteries, and 
vital spirits, as this plant is are justly and rationally accounted 
to be under the dominion of the Sun who is the fountain of 
life, Lord of Leo and exalted in Aries, whereas Mercury hath 
only predominancy over some particular operations of the 
brain, as he hath in all the five sences. Its Generally approved 
of all Authors that the bulk of the brain in all creatures, 
is under the dominion of the Moon. The vital and quickning 
part under the Sun, the operation of Mercury as aforesaid. Now 
[^p.11^] 
to gather this plant at the right planetary hour, that so you 
may have the influence of both planets in question, you must 
do as before expressed, let those planets concerned be in either 
Conjunction, Trine, or Sextile, aspect unto each other, at the 
time of gathering, or otherwise let the Moon be separating and 
applying from the one planet to the other at the time of gathering 
by any of the before going aspects: Example, If I were 
minded to gather the said sweet marjerome in September, 
1669. about which time such like plants are in their prime to 
gather. In which moneth upon the fourteenth day the Sun 
and Mercury are in partil Conjunction, but their influence holds 
above a week before and after, for until they are separated 
ten degrees from each other their Orbs, Raies, or Influence 
holds strong unto perfection, wherefore you may gather this 
plant aright upon Sunday the fifth day, or upon Sunday the 
tenth day or upon Sunday the fifteenth day from the Suns 
rising until the Sun is about an hour in hight; and likewise 
in the afternoon between one and two of the clock as appeareth 
in the perpetual Almanack for the day appointed. Also 
you may gather any days of those weeks, when the Sun is Lord 
of the hour, and if the Moon be in friendly aspect its the better 
how to find the Lord of the hour, I have shewed elsewhere 
at the beginning of the second book 
 
NOTE, That in gathering all kinds of herbs and plants 
whatsoever, more especially, when you intend to do any 
great cure, you must get the influential virtue of one of 
the fortunes, viz. the Sun, Jupiter, or Venus to be joyned 
or be in some friendly aspect with that planet, which 
owns the plant having regard unto the infirmity or grief 
which either by simpathy or antipathy hath any relation 
to the fortune as instance endive, which is cold and dry 
under Mercury yet in regard its approved good to cool the 
heat of the liver, which is under Jupiter, therefore let Jupiter 
be in Conjunction, Trine, or Sextile aspect unto Mercury 
or the Moon separating and applying by any of those aspects 
from the one planet to the other, when you gather 
the plant, this is to be done, when an infortune owns the 
plant or herb you are minded to gather. 
 
[^p.12^] 
[}A Plain and Easie way how to gather herbs or plants 
aright that so you may have the benefit both of 
the day and hour, when each planet reigneth, which 
owneth the plant throughout the year: And will 
generally serve to gather any Herbs or plants aright 
for the use of physick, Being fitted for every ten 
dayes of the Month thooughout the year and so for 
ever.}] 
 
[}NOTE,}] 
 
All Herbs and Plants, which are under the dominion 
of the Sun are gathered on Sundayes: and all those herbs 
and plants which are under the dominion of the Moon 
are gathered on Mondayes: and all those under Mars on 
Tuesdayes: and all those under Mercury on wednesdayes: 
and all those under Jupiter on Thursdayes: and all those under 
Venus on Fridayes: and all those under Saturn on Saturdayes. 
Now every planet which is Lord of the day, ruleth 
the first and the eighth hour of the day, each day being 
divided into twelve equal parts, which we call the planetary 
hours (and so the planetary hours are near twice so 
long in the highest of Summer, as they are in the midst of 
winter) Example, Suppose I were minded to gather herbs 
or plants under the dominion of Sol upon one of the first 
ten dayes of January: Then upon Sunday from the Suns rising, 
which is six minutes after eight a clock until 46 min. 
past eight in the morning, and likewise from 40 minutes 
past noon until 20 minutes past one, you may gather any 
herb or plant under the dominion of the Sun by which account 
you have the benefit both of the day and hour as aforesaid 
as appeareth in the Table following, you may do 
the like for any other plant or herb whatsoever, alwayes remembring 
that the planet which is Lord of the day ever 
ruleth the first and the eighth hour, divided as aforesaid into 
twelve equal parts.

[}The Astrological way, whereby to discover all kinds of 
Diseases, or Infirmities incident unto the body of Man: 
And likewise how to know whether the Sick shall live 
or die: also the time, when either Recovery or Death 
may be expected; with the true Astrological way of 
curing each Disease which is cureable, as followeth.}] 
 
IN the first place, before we come to set forth the Method 
of cure, it will be necessary to find what the grief is, and 
from what cause; without which its impossible to do any great 
cures. There are two wayes by which Judgment may be given 
herein: The one Astrologically by a Figure of twelve 
Houses, which is accounted to be the most assured and exactest 
way: the other is by the Moon according as she is afflicted 
by the malevolent Planets, having regard to the signs or constellations, 
wherein she was afflicted, at the time of decumbiture: 
This way may serve generally in acute diseases, and 
I do find by my daily practice, that one shall seldom err 
herein, but in case of such Diseases, which are natural from 
the birth, or have been of very long standing, or more especially, 
if there be any suspition of Witchcraft, a Figure of 
twelve houses is most rational I shall briefly shew the way of 
both: But in regard a Figure of twelve Houses and the astrological 
way in giving judgement thereupon may seem difficult 
at the first, especially unto those, who have never formerly 
read or studied any whit in this Science: And farther 
considering that many, who are well willers hereunto either 
may want time, or be unwilling to take the pains herein, 
may neglect the study hereof, and so this my writing may 
prove uselesse unto them, I have for the satisfaction and incouragement 
of all well willers unto this study and practice 
of Physick, set forth one general way in giving judgment, 
either by the Moon afflicted in acute diseases, which terminate 
in a month, or by the Sun in Chronick diseases, which 
are of above a months standing: This being the very way of my 
own daily practice and experience for many years, wherein 
you shall seldome or never fail, especially in acute diseases, as 
for other Chronick and long lasting griefs there will be more 
time allotted to consider of them: The truth is long continued 
infirmities (and some others) doth require more inspection 
than that only of the Sun and Moon afflicted and therefore 
a figure of twelve houses will be proper to give judgement 
therein for many times the ascendant, sixth and twelfth 
[^p.21^] 
houses with their Lords will be concerned therein, as shall be 
shewed in order. Also it will be necessary after the grief is 
known, to know the critical, intercidental, and judicial daies 
and times, being the times for change either of life or death 
which is done by a critical figure divided into 16 equal parts, 
as shall be shewed in the next paper. 
 
[}The way to find the disease by the Sun and Moon afflicted.}] 
 
In the first place by an Almanack take notice, what sign 
the Moon is in, when the Sick first takes their bed, and by 
what planet or planets she is afflicted, whether of Saturn or 
Mars (or Mercury, which is much of the nature of Saturn) 
Then having recourse unto the rules elsewhere in this Book 
under the titles of the Moon by Saturn or Mars afflicted; 
there you shall find the disease and the cause thereof. The 
Almanack, which you use herein must be such a one which 
setteth forth the daily motions of the planets: I shall give 
one or two examples hereof, as followeth, A Friend of 
mine took his bed the 10th day of October 1667 at a quarter 
past one a clock after noon, the Moon being of nine degrees in 
Sagitary and Mars in eight degrees thirty five minutes in 
Virgo, which argueth that Mars is in platick square to the 
Moon, we call that a platick aspect, which doth not perfectly 
accord in degrees and minutes, and if Mars had been 
but one degree in Virgo, yet we should account it a platick 
Square, by reason that the Orbs, Rayes, or Influence 
of the Moon unto any planet do_[^ORIG. BLANK^]h begin to opperate, when she 
is within ten degrees aspecting any planet (as is shewed at 
large elsewhere) Now to find the Grief with its cause, 
you must repair unto the place in this book intituled, The 
Moon in Sagitary of Mars oppressed, as in page 57 which sheweth 
that the Sick is tormented with a strong fever and cholerick 
passions, &c. occasioned by surfeiting or too much repletion 
as there more at large appeareth: the next thing considerable 
is to know whether the Sick shall live or die, and 
the time when either death or recovery may be expected: 
Now in regard that the Moon is applying by a friendly Sex to aspect 
unto Venus a fortune, and free from combustion and not in 
that part of the Zodiack called via combusta (as shall be shewed 
more at large elsewhere) I did conclude that the sick would recover 
(and so he did) had the Moon applyed unto the infortuos 
[^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] or [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] and no fortune interposed his friendly Rays, then I should 
have concluded that the sick would have died of this sickness to 
know when the time of recovery will be is found by a critical 
[^p.22^] 
figure or circle divided into 16 equal parts, I shall not stand 
or spend time to give you the definition of each term of art; 
Onely thus much I say, the intercidental time or divident 
part of the circle is not so dangerous, as the judicial time or 
part, nor yet the judicial time so dangerous as the critical 
time. 
 
[^An illustration of the circle omitted.^] 
 
Note, That in this critical figure each part containeth 22 
deg. 30 min. you must begin where the Moon was at the decumbiture, 
viz. in 9 deg. [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] unto which you must add 22. deg. 
30 min. Now in regard there is 30 deg. in every sign you must 
set down 1 deg. 30 min. Capricorn, for the first intercidental time 
into which 1 deg. 30 min. you must add 22 deg. 30 min. which 
maketh 24 Capricorn, for the first judicial time: Now if you 
[^p.23^] 
add 22 deg. 30 min. unto the last number it maketh 6 
deg. 30 min. Aquarius, which is the second intercidental 
time and if you add 22 deg. 30 min. unto the last number, 
it maketh 9 deg. Pisces, which is the first crisis or 
mortal time, according unto which account you must go 
round the circle, as appeareth by the figure, now to know 
when the time of recovery will be you must observe by a critical 
figure, when the Moon upon a critical day doth meet 
with any friendly aspect of either of the fortunes, viz. Jupiter 
or Venus or Sol or Leo, for then the time of recovery 
may be expected. This critical figure being set for a friend 
of mine at the time aforesaid. I did observe each change, 
and alteration of his distemper; and I alwayes found that 
upon the critical and judicial dayes and times, he was ever 
most afflicted. The reason is because the Quartiles, Opposions, 
and Semi-quartile aspects are more pernitious and hateful 
aspects, then any other, as the intercidental times, which 
happen between the critical and judicial times consisting only 
of 22 deg. and a half, which we call a Semi Semi Quartile aspect, 
they seldom prove mortal, by reason the aspect is not 
so bad and forceable as the other, it being but a half the half 
quartile aspect, yet notwithstanding sometimes in perperacute 
mortal sicknesses, I have known the Sick depart, when 
the Moon came unto a partile evil aspect of the infortunes, 
no fortune interposing their friendly rayes upon an intercedental 
time, but this is not usual; but as concerning the time 
of recovery of my Friend beforementioned it was upon 
the fourth and last critical day, the Moon being returned unto 
the place she was in at the decumbiture: at which time she 
applyed to the Sextile of Venus and Trine of Jupiter, which 
happened upon the sixt day of November after midnight, 
would my friend have been let blood, he might questionless 
have recovered upon the second crisis, at what time the moon 
applyed to the Trine of Venus, now had this Sickness continued 
longer, than we account the grief Chronick, and then 
we give judgement by the Sun afflicted, as before we did by 
the Moon But all acute griefs do end usually before the 
moon goeth round the Zodiack; some griefs are peracute 
and those end sooner, others are perperacute, and those 
commonly make a quick dispatch one way or other. But of 
this I have treated more at large elsewhere. 
 
[^p.24^] 
[}Judgment upon an Imaginary decumbiture,}] 
 
For the better explanation hereof I shall instance two or 
three Imaginary Decumbitures as followeth. Suppose one 
should take his Bed April the 10th 1668. at Noon, the Moon 
being then in 12. deg. 50 min. in the Signe Leo and Saturn, in 
12 deg. 50 min. in the Signe Aquary now this is called a partile 
opposition aspect, by reason the Moon and Saturn are just in 
the same deg. and min. opposite unto each other: had the sick 
took his bed 16 hours sooner, or later, then it would have 
been called a Platick opposition, for as I have said elsewhere, 
the influence of the Moon and Planets doth begin to appear 
when she is 10 deg. distant from any aspect which will take 
up near 20 hours motion before and after separation; Now 
to know what the Grief is, you must seek out the place in 
this Book intituled the Moon in Leo of Saturn oppressed, which 
argueth the Sick shall be troubled with unkindly heat in the 
Breast, and a violent Feavour, with faintness at the heart, or 
swounding fits, and inclining to the Black jaundies occasioned 
from ill Melancholly blood, &c. Now to know whether 
the sick shall live or dye, and the time when either recoverie, 
or Death may be expected, is as followeth. 
 
First, the Moon is increasing in light. Secondly she is not 
in that place in the Zodiack called via combusta, which is 
from the middest of the Signe Libra unto the middest of Scorpio 
Thirdly the Mo_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n seperateth from Jupiter a fortune, and applyeth 
unto a friendly Trine aspect of the Sun fountain of 
life. Fourthly, the Moon is free from combustion of the Sun. 
A Planet is under combustion when he is not fully elongated 
7 deg. 30 min. from him. We have only two Testimonies of 
Death, which is first, Saturns being in opposition of the 
Moon at the time of decumbiture. Secondly his being more 
strong then the Moon, yet commonly a Planet strong is not so 
malicious as those which are weak and peregrine; however it 
appeareth that there is foure testimonies of Life and but two 
of Death, wherefore we may conclude according to the 
Rules of Art that the Sick shall recover: Now to know the 
time when you must by a Critical figure of 16 equal parts; 
take notice when the Moon upon any Intercidental, Judicial 
or Critical day doth meet with any benevolent aspect of the 
fortunes, be it sun, _[^ORIG. BLANK^]upiter, Venus or Dragons head, no evil 
Planet interposing their bad Influence for then the Sick shall 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ecover, which according unto the Critical figure will be 
[^p.25^] 
upon the 12th. day of April about one a Clock at night, at 
which time the Moon will be in 14 deg. of the Signe Virgo 
and Jupiter in 14 deg. of Taurus making a partile Trine to 
each other, but the sick shall begin to recover sooner at the 
first intercidental time, which is about six a clock in the 
morning (at which time the Moon will be 5 deg. 20 min. in 
Virgo, which is 22 deg. 30 min. distance from the place she 
was in at the decumbiture) for as I have already declared 
the influence of the Moon doth begin to opperate, when she 
is ten degrees distant from any aspect of the planets. 
 
[}Concerning Acute Griefs.}] 
 
Note, That at the time of decumbiture of any sick person, 
if the Moon be free from the bad aspects of the infortunes, 
which is Saturn, Mars, Mercury, or Dragons tail that then 
(more especially) if the infortunes Jupiter or Venus attend 
upon the next judicial or critical day or time that the Moon 
meeteth with any friendly aspect of the fortunes, no ill planet 
opposing the Sick shall recover: but commonly acute 
griefs are seldom ended before the first critical time, at 
which time the Moon maketh a Quartile aspect unto the 
place she was in at the decumbiture, consisting of 90 deg. 
The Moon alwayes goeth this 90 deg or fourth part of the 
Zodiack in lesse than eight dayes; sometimes acute griefs 
last untill the Moon hath passed over three critical days 
or times, Viz. until she returneth unto the place she was 
in at the decumbiture making the fourth crisis; An Example 
hereof is of my friend beforementioned: and if by the 
Rules aforesaid you find that the grief is mortal, then you 
must proceed forward round the critical figure, until you 
find the mortal time, according unto the rules beforementioned, 
and you must do the like upon the rules for the time 
of recovery. 
 
[}Concerning Peracute griefs.}] 
 
There are also some Infirmities and Sicknesses which 
end usually before the first judicial time is over (called 
peracute griefs) at which time the Moon maketh a Semi-quartile 
aspect to the place she was in at the decumbiture, 
consisting of 45 deg. now this aspect is not so pernicious as the 
[^p.26^] 
Quartile, yet oft-times the Sick dyeth before this aspect is 
over; more especially when the Moon at that time meeteth 
with the infortunes, and no fortune interposing their friendly 
rayes. This Semi Quartile aspect or judicial time, the Moon 
finisheth in less than four days likewise on the contrary by the 
rules aforesaid the Sick may recover at the said judicial time. 
 
[}Concerning Perperacute Sicknesses.}] 
 
There are also some Sicknesses perperacute, and such griefs 
commonly terminate before the first intercedental time is 
over at which time the Moon maketh a Semi Semi Quartile 
aspect to the place she was in at the decumbiture, which consisteth 
of 22 deg. 30 min. containing the 16th. part of the critical 
figure, more especially when the infortunes doth afflict 
the Moon, at that time no fortune attending: It was observable, 
that in the time of the plague, that many thousands died 
before the first intercidental time was over, which number 
or time the Moon finisheth in less than two dayes. And 
many lived not one day, dying immediately so soon as they 
were struck, which we call the time of decumbiture or first 
mortal time. I have known the like both in Appoplexies and 
Convulsions, mother fits, and risings in the throat, and such 
like griefs. 
 
[}Another Judgement given upon a decumbiture 
Figure.}] 
 
I shall take an imaginary time, and so give judgement 
thereupon for the better informing of young Students herein 
I could have inserted many exemplary figures of my own, but 
considering that new Almanacks may be had when happily 
old ones may be lost I therefore thought this way most profitable 
to instruct the learner. I shall instance the 22 day of 
April 1668 about nine a clock at night, at which time I will 
suppose one took his bed: Now the question is what the grief 
is, and whether the Sick will live or die: And when either 
death or recovery may be expected, you must in the first 
place by an Almanack find in what sign the Moon is, and how 
aspected: Now at the hour and time aforesaid, the Moon will 
be in 5 deg. 48 min. of the sign Aquarius, and at the same time. 
I find Mars to be in 5 deg. 48 min. of the sign Scorpio, which 
maketh a partile Square aspect consisting of 90 deg.: Now to 
find what the grief is you must repair unto the place in this 
book, where it is written, The Moon in Aquarius of Mars oppressed, 
[^p.27^] 
which argueth, that the Sick shall be troubled with 
great pain at the heart and with swooning fits also very feavourish, 
likewise a pain in the breast with difficulty of breathing, 
and the blood swelling in all the veins, the cause of this 
sickness proceeding from violent affections and vehement passions, 
&c. Now the next thing considerable is to know whether 
the Sick be like to live or die; and the time when either 
death or recovery may be expected. First the Moon is 
decreasing in light, Secondly the Moon departeth from 
the Square of Mars and applyed unto the Conjunction of Saturn 
both enemical planets: Thirdly, neither Sol, Jupiter, or 
Venus doth cast their friendly rayes or influence at the time 
aforesaid unto the Moon, wherefore according unto the rules 
aforesaid, the sick person will die: To find the time, when 
you must frame a critical figure of sixteen equal parts as aforesaid, 
begining at the place where the Moon was at the 
decumbiture, making that the first critical or mortal time, 
which if the Sick escape, then at the next critical or mortal 
time, you must observe how the Moon is aspected, at which 
time you shall find the Moon meeteth with the opposition of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] 
being upon the 29th. day of April in the Month aforesaid at 
one a clock after noon: Now in regard there is no fortunate 
planet interposing their friendly rays at that time we may conclude 
that the sick wil depart, and not before, because the Sun at 
intercedental and judicial times meeteth with no bad aspect of 
the infortunes. Yet notwithstanding I have known some, 
who have been mortally struck according, unto any rational 
mans judgment at the decumbiture in acute griefs, who 
through Gods blessing, having an expert and skilful Physitian, 
and having withstood the bad influence of the afflicting planets, 
at the first mortal time beyond expectation upon the 
next critical time have recovered, and so it may happily prove 
to some, who shall take their bed at the time aforesaid. The 
reason is because between the time of decumbiture and first 
crisis, there is usually near seven days time, during which time 
(especial remedies being applyed) the Sick may happily be 
the better enabled to with-stand the encounter, more especially 
if the intercedental and judicial times be freed from the 
evil aspects of the infortunes, as here it falleth out at this 
last decumbiture. The truth is life and death is in the hands 
of God, and whatsoever stars foreshew, yet he by his power 
and blessing upon the means used can preserve life, when he 
pleaseth, wherefore the sick ought not at any time to despair, 
For I my self have oft times recovered my Patient having out 
lived the first mortal time as aforesaid, but I must needs say 
[^p.28^] 
such changes and chances are seldom seen, for where one 
doth escape many dieth for the stars are God's Messengers, 
and what they do foreshew, do assuredly without miracle 
come to pass. Concerning the way and manner how to cure 
each distemper, I have shewed elsewhere. 
 
[}Concerning the Astrological way of giving Judgement 
by a Sign of 12 Houses.}] 
 
Although what is already written, I have known by good 
experience to hold true by many examples it being for the 
most part the method of my daily practice; yet for the benefit 
and better satisfaction of Practitioners, and others, well-willers 
thereunto, especially such who desire further inspection 
into this Art. I shall in the next place shew how in an 
Astrological way judgement may be given by a figure of 12 
Houses. For I must confess that in such infirmities, which 
are natural from the birth, and likewise some chronick griefs, 
which have been of long continuance, and likewise such infirmities, 
wherein there is any suspition of witchcraft, cannot 
so exactly be discovered by the Sun or Moon afflicted, as 
by a sign of twelve houses for the ascendant sixth, eighth, 
and twelfth Houses with their Lords will be for the most part 
concerned therein as shall be shewed in order as followeth. In 
the first place you must erect your figure; either for the time 
of decumbiture, or for the time of any strong fit (if any be) 
or upon the receipt of the Urin, or time of the first visitation 
of the Patient, and you must be sure for to frame, and vary your 
ascendant, that it together with its Lord may exactly personate 
the Sick. Secondly you must in order set down the 
Cuspe of every House. Thirdly you must set down the Characters 
of the Planets in every House, which for to do, and 
likewise how to frame the ascendant, I shall briefly dec_[^ORIG. BLANK^]are. 
But before you can proceed herein, you must perfectly know 
the Characters of the seven Planets, and twelve signs, and 
the five Aspects of the Planets, and the Houses of each Planet.
