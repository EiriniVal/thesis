The First Chapter. 
 
What Phlebotomy is, and of the foure distinct kinds 
and vses thereof.}] 
 
PHlebotomy is the letting out 
of bloud by the opening of a 
vayne, for the preuenting or 
curing of some griefe or infirmitie. 
I take in this place 
bloud, not as it is simple and 
pure of it self, but as it is mingled 
with other humours, to wit, fleame, choler, 
melancholy, and the tenue serum, which all (as 
Fernelius sheweth) as they are conteined together 
[/1./] 
in the vaynes, are by one word vsually called by 
the name of bloud. And although it still fall out 
that other humours are also by Phlebotomy euacuated 
out of the whole body, yet (as Fuchsius doth 
[/2./] 
proue out of Galen) it is properly the remedy of 
those diseases, which of the ranknes of bloud haue 
taken their originall. There are foure seuerall 
sorts and vses of letting of bloud. The first is called 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], euacuatio: The second is called [^GREEK OMITTED^], and 
[/3./] 
of Montanus ciscutatio: The third [^GREEK OMITTED^], revulsio: 
The fourth [^GREEK OMITTED^], deriuatio. The first, which 
[^p.2^] 
is called Euacuation, is the auoyding of that repletion 
and fulnesse whereby the body is ouercharged. 
 
Repletion or fulnesse, called of the Grecians 
Plethora, is an vniuersall redounding of bloud. 
It is of two sorts, the one is called quoad vasa, 
[/4./] 
when the vaynes and vessels conteyning bloud, 
haue their whole capacity fully and thoroughly 
filled: and the second repletion is called quoad vires, 
in which the vaynes do not swell, and yet they 
conteyne more bloud and nourishment then by 
nature can be ordered and gouerned. In the repletion 
quoad vasa (as Montanus sheweth) are two 
[/5./] 
dangers, first, least by the immoderate quantity 
there should happen either suffocation, or the rupture 
of some vayne: and secondly, least the abundance 
of bloud should corrupt and putrefie. For 
the auoyding of both these perils, it is very expedient 
that in a full body a vaine should be opened, 
although no griefe do draw vs thereunto, but only 
the meere fulnesse. For as Hippocrates sayth, The 
[/6./] 
full habit of the bodies of champions, if it come to the 
highest degree of fulnesse it is fraile and slippery, for it 
can not continue long in the same estate. The second 
kinde of repletion termed quoad vires, is rather to 
be holpen by medicins then by letting of bloud. 
For if raw and vndigested humours do abound in 
the body, the opening of a vayne will draw out 
much good bloud: but as for the bad bloud which 
is gathered in the first vaynes about the liuer and 
the middle entrals, it will draw it into the whole 
[/7./] 
body, as Galen doth at large demonstrate, and 
therefore euacuation by some purging potion 
shall in this case be more fit then letting of bloud. 
[^p.3^] 
Yet when by the nature of the disease there is euident 
danger of a corruption and putrefaction 
of humours to ensue, then a little quantitie of 
bloud drawen shall be much auaylable to anticipate 
and preueunt it, if alwayes regard be had how 
farre the strength will permit, and what humour 
is especially mixt together with the bloud in the 
vaynes. For as Fernelius sheweth, there is another 
[/8./] 
way two kinds of repletion or plethora, the one 
is called pure, the other impure. Montanus maketh 
also two, the one simple, and the other compound. 
The pure doth consist of (in a manner) an 
equall portion of all the best iuices. The impure 
is an abounding of vicious humours in the vaines. 
If the plenitude come by choler, the vayne may 
the more plentifully make euacuation. But if 
the fulnesse come by fleame or by melancholie, 
then must the euacuation be made by little 
and little at seuerall times when necessitie requireth, 
and when the vaynes being ouer-full doe 
threaten danger. How all these seuerall kindes 
of plenitude shall be knowne, I shall haue occasion 
to declare more at large in the first Chapter 
of the second booke. 
 
The first vse of Phlebotomy, to wit, euacuation, 
hath place not onely in pure repletions, 
but also in all dangers of putrefaction, according 
[/9./] 
to that of Galen: It is good to open a vayne 
not onely in feuers called synochi (which haue one 
continuall fit, and doe proceede of inflamed bloud) 
but also in all other humours that stand in danger 
of putrefaction, when the regard which is had 
of age and strength doth nothing prohibite. For nature 
which doth dispose and gouerne our bodies 
[^p.4^] 
being lightened, and hauing put off that which at 
a burthen did ouercharge her, will easily ouercome 
the rest in such sort, that it will concoct what 
is to be concocted, and expell what is to be expelled. 
 
The second vse of letting-bloud is called of Montanus 
[/10./] 
euentatio, wherupon he maketh a seco~d kind 
called Phlebotomia euentatiua, which is the venting 
of any humour that doth boyle and bubble within 
the vaines. For as the former, to wit euacuation, 
[/11./] 
hath respect vnto the plenitude; so this [^GREEK OMITTED^] hath 
properly a relation to the boyling and bubbling. 
So (sayth he) in quotidians and quartans we do 
often let bloud, not because there is any fulnesse or 
great multitude of ill humours, but because we 
would by venting take away the boyling and 
bubbling thereof. This venting hath place both 
whether there be any putrefaction in the humour 
or no. But if our scope and purpose be only simply 
to vent, then it is best to do it by letting a little 
bloud, and often according to the rule of Auicenna, 
Melior est multiplicatio numeri quam quantitatis. 
Otherwise if the case be compound that both there 
be a fulnesse and a boyling, that we must both euacuate 
and vent, then shall it be most fit to do it at 
once, and plentifully and as long as the strength 
will permit, as is taught at large by Galen in the 
eight booke of his Methodus medendi. And in the 
same booke speaking of some agues that are like 
to Diarian feuers, and do come of obstructions, he 
[/12./] 
doth vse these words: That the humour may be vented 
wee haue neede of the great remedy, wee must let 
bloud the party being of sufficient strength, although 
there be no signes of plenitude. How it shal be knowen 
[^p.5^] 
when the humours do thus boyle and haue neede 
of venting, it shall be layd open at large in the 
two Chapters next following. 
 
The third vse of letting bloud is called [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
Revulsion: Montanus calleth it Phlebotomia diuersiua, 
which is a plucking back of humours, 
when they are caried from any one part of the 
body into an other with force and violent course. 
Euacuation doth respect the fulnesse, Venting the bubbling 
vp, and Revulsion the violent course of the humour. 
How this revulsion must be made, is discussed 
in the seauenth Chapter of this first booke. 
 
The fourth vse of bloud letting is called [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
deriuatio; of Montanus, Phlebotomia deriuatiua, 
which is deriuing of a humour from any place 
where it is settled and impacted, into some other 
neere place, by which it may best be ouercome or 
auoyded. It differeth from revulsion two especiall 
wayes. First, revulsion is into places farre distant, 
[/13./] 
as Hippocrates sheweth: We must endeuour to open a 
vayne distant as farre as may be from the place where 
the griefe is made or the bloud gathered, for so there 
shall be no danger of a sodaine change, and besides the 
custome being translated an other way, thou shalt make 
that there shall be no more flowing to the former wonted 
place. But deriuation of humours is into the neerest 
places, as by which they may most fitly be auoyded, 
[/14./] 
according to that of Galen: Deriuation is made 
into places nigh ioyning, but revulsion is made into places 
plaine opposite. Againe, an other difference there 
is, that revulsion is of humours now flowing, but 
deriuation is of them that are already settled, as is 
[/15./] 
witnessed by the same Author: If the flowing be 
still caryed in his violent course, we must vse revulsion 
[^p.6^] 
to draw it to the contraries, but when the humor is settled 
and impacted in the place, then it is better to deriue 
it. He giueth the reason of it, for the change is neerer, 
and both the accesse and the drawing force of the 
purging medicine is more readie when the place is nigh. 
[/16./] 
And what there he speaketh of medicins, the same 
he writeth of Phlebotomy. Reuulsion is the remedy 
of fluxes or rheumes still flowing, but deriuation is their 
help when they haue taken hold of any part: but both 
these kindes of euacuation doth Hippocrates commaund 
to be done by the common vaynes. Thus much 
briefely concerning the first question, what Phlebotomy 
is, and of the foure seuerall kinds or rather 
vses thereof. 
 
[}CHAP. 2. 
 
How letting of bloud may be vsed in continuall agues 
called synochi, in hote agues, and how also in burning 
feuers.}] 
 
BEing now to declare particularly, how 
Phlebotomy is to be vsed in most of the 
vsuall diseases which co~monly do raigne 
amongst men, seeing there is no kind of infirmitie 
that hath more sorts of it selfe subiect to letting of 
bloud then hath the Ague, I haue thought it not 
amisse to begin first with it. In the ague synochus, 
which hath one continuall fit, seeing that it proceedeth 
of the inflammation of bloud, needs must 
the opening of a vayne be very fit and conuenient 
for it. But there are two kinds of it. The one is called 
synochus mitior, or ephemera extensa, in which 
only the thinner part of the bloud is kindled, it is 
dissolued very often before the fift day, it hath 
the vrine somewhat reddish and thick, the pulse 
[^p.7^] 
great and thick, but not euidently vnequall. And 
the other is called synochus vehementior, wherein 
the whole substance of bloud is inflamed. It carieth 
manifest notes of crudities, to wit, vnequalnes 
in the pulse, and the vrine red and thick, and the 
tongue waxeth somewhat rough and blackish. 
In either of these synochi letting of bloud is requisite, 
and that as plentifully as strength will permit. 
If at first it were omitted, it may be done in the 
fourth day or in the seauenth day, or after the seauenth 
day. But the best and safest time is euen in 
[/17./] 
the beginning of the infirmity, as Fernelius sayth, 
It is more safe to let bloud when the disease approcheth, 
then when it hath already taken possession of vs, according 
to the old verse: 
 
Ægrius eijcitur, quam non admittitur hospes. 
 
It is a more hard thing to cast out a bad guest, 
then it is at the first not to admit him. 
 
[/18./] 
And therefore Platerus willeth vs in these synochi 
sine putredine, wherein the bloud is not putrefied 
but inflamed, to hasten the letting of bloud, not 
only to vent or euentilate the bloud inflamed, but 
also to pluck back the same, least breaking out of 
the vaines into the principall parts, it doth stirre 
vp there most perilous inflammations. For Platerus 
and Fontanonus be both of this opinion, that 
the inflammations in the noble parts do follow 
these synochi, and not go before them. And therefore 
they do aduise in the first beginning to open 
a vayne, and if in the first day it be omitted when 
the ague is thought to be but an ephemera, an inflaming 
of the spirits for one day; yet the next day 
following, when it appeareth plainely that it is no 
ephemera, because it lasteth longer then a day, but 
[^p.8^] 
that it is a playne synochus, then let out bloud 
boldly a good quantity, according to the strength 
of the partie; or else take the lesse bloud at once, 
and open the vayne either the same day or the 
next day againe, which is the safest way for such 
as be weake. In this ague doth the second vse 
of Phlebotomy, to wit, euentatio, or euentilatio 
greatly shew forth his power, according to that 
of Galen, writing of the hoat ague called synochus: 
[/19./] 
In whom soeuer the body in the multitude of humours 
being made vnapt to vent and breath out, hath 
gathered such a heate that now it is come to a feuer, 
the party must be let bloud as much as strength can endure, 
knowing that if this remedie be not taken, they 
which are so affected shall either be strangled by suffocations, 
or suffer syncopies and very dangerous swoundings 
wholy to ouerthrow them. Montanus writing 
[/20./] 
vpon the thirtenth Canon of Auicenna concerning 
bloud-letting, doth make three seuerall sorts 
of this hote ague comming of bloud inflamed, and 
sheweth in which of them bloud may best be let. 
The first is called Homotona, which from the beginning 
to the end doth keepe the same tenour. The 
second Epacmastica, which increaseth more and 
more vntill it come to state and vigor. The third 
Paracmastica, which alwayes decreaseth. In the 
first and the last he admitteth boldly to let bloud, 
but in the second sparingly, least strength and power 
fayling the disease should ouercome nature. 
So also if it be febris putrida, or synochus cum putredine, 
a feuer wherein the humor is putrified, he 
doth require a little before in the same booke, that 
we should not let bloud in any great quantity: 
Because where the humour is already putrified, although 
[^p.9^] 
we should let bloud euen till the strength fayle, 
yet should we not auoyde the putrefaction: for putrified 
bloud is become earthly, and therefore can not be expelled. 
And if we let bloud in a great quantity, the putrefaction 
will still remaine, and the vertue and strength 
will be made so weake, that we shall not be able to remoue 
that putrefaction which remayneth. He obiecteth 
the example of Galen his practise, who in a 
certain seruant hauing this synochus cum putredine, 
did let bloud ple~tifully to swouning or fainting. But 
[/21./] 
he aswereth to that place, that when Galen came 
to that seruant, the humour was not fully putrified, 
but only that there appeared some signes of putrefaction, 
and in the second day he opened a vayne. So 
that when the signes of putrefaction did begin he 
let bloud, and not when the humour was alreadie 
putrified: and further, it was a feuer alwayes declining. 
[/22./] 
But he co~cludeth there, I say playnely that 
if the feuer should be with a putrefaction and a vaine 
should be opened, the patient should be killed. The most 
certaine signe to know when the ague is faulty 
only by meanes of the inflammation, and when it 
is faulty by the putrefaction, is (as Trincauel in his 
[/23./] 
explanation vpon Galen doth shew) by the systole 
and diastole of the pulses. For there is a double vse 
of the pulse, the one for cooling of the spirits, and 
to that doth serue the diastole, or enlarging of the 
artery, for when the artery is enlarged a more cooling 
ayre being drawne in, doth temper the heate 
of the spirits. The other is that the smoaky vapour 
(which must needes be engendred by the force of 
heate working vpon moysture) may be so let out, 
that the spirits may be purified: and to this vse serueth 
systole the contraction or compression of the 
[^p.10^] 
artery. For while the artery is drawne and prest 
togither, the hote ayre and smoky vapours are expelled 
and auoyded. Now it must needes be that 
betwixt these two contrary motions, a rest must 
of necessitie goe betweene them. When there is 
neede of cooling, there the diastole or enlarging of 
the artery is swifter, and the inward pawse or rest 
is shorter: but where there is more neede of auoyding 
moyst and putrifyed excrements, there the 
systole or contraction of the artery is swifter, and 
the outward pawse is shorter. And this later he 
maketh to be the most certayne note to know all 
putrifyed agues, in which the humours rotting, 
many smoky vapours must needes be engendred, 
this he calleth so proper, familiar, inseparable, and 
certaine a signe to know and discerne putrified agues 
from others, that it neither doth nor can deceiue. An other 
signe there is of a putrifyed ague, when exspiratio 
est inspiratione insignior, when the breathing 
out is more euident then the breathing in, because 
there is more neede of exhaling putrified vapours, 
then of cooling. Alex. Massaria pag. 134. sheweth 
sundry causes why letting bloud should be good 
in putrified agues, first, it cooleth and dryeth, and 
all cooling and drying things are good for putrefactions. 
Againe, it is good in respect of the ague, 
and last of all it helpeth much transpiration, by 
meanes whereof it must needes be good to help 
[/24./] 
putrefaction. When Montanus affirmeth that to 
let bloud in putrefied agues is to kill the patient, he 
meaneth a liberall euacuating of bloud, but otherwise 
his words before do shew plainely that it 
may be done moderately to vent the vapours. 
[/25./] 
And Platerus sheweth an other cause why it ought 
[^p.11^] 
to be done, because the occasion of putrified agues 
doth lie hid in the bloud and in the branches of the 
hollow vayne, together with the bloud is auoided some 
[/26./] 
portion of the putrified humour. Of the same iudgeme~t 
is Fernelius, The opening of a vaine which may take away 
both the multitude and also a great portion of the 
putrified humour, doth greatly auayle to the curing of 
[/27./] 
the feuer. And an other reason sheweth Galen why 
this must be done, because nature being disburthened 
of a part, shall the more easily ouercome the whole, as I 
haue declared in the Chapter going before in the 
first vse of Phlebotomy 
 
If the ague be that which is called Causo the burning 
feuer, whose matter is not the heate of bloud, 
but the burning of choler (and whose signes are 
tossing of the body, an vnsatiable thirst, the toong 
[/28./] 
dry and rough either yellow or black, a nipping 
about the stomack and liuer, yellow excrements, 
the vrine very thinne and something wanne, the 
pulse swift, thick and hard, doating, a little sweate 
about the forehead and neck, but euery where else 
the skin very dry, and therewithall a little rough) 
letting bloud may also well be vsed at the beginning, 
but in no great quantity, only foure or fiue 
ounces for venting or euentilation are sufficient. 
[/29./] 
Auicenna in his curing of the Causo doth affirme, 
that bloud is not to be let in it, vnlesse there doe 
appeare rednesse and thicknesse of vrine, but that 
is not Causo, but rather synochus. Montanus sheweth, 
[/30./] 
that the true continuall burning feuer seeing 
that the matter which doth putrifie in it (to wit 
choler) is most hote and most dry, it becommeth 
in a manner altogether firy. 
 
[/31./] 
Hppocrates teacheth the way of curing a burning 
[^p.12^] 
feuer by quenching the burning heate, by 
giuing water and mulsa aquosa, but he maketh no 
mention of letting of bloud, thereupon Montanus 
doth conclude: that letting of bloud is not to be 
permitted in a burning feuer. But I thinke Montanus 
his argument in that disputation vpon the 
eleuenth Canon of Auicenna is of small force. For 
although Hippocrates do not precisely commaund 
in that place bloud to be let in a burning feuer, 
yet he maketh it in the same place to be a signe 
of the dissolution of the disease if the patient do 
bleede at the nose: and presently vpon it he vttereth 
these words, At in morbis acutis sanguinem 
detrahes si vehemens fuerit morbus, & qui aegrotant 
ætate florenti fuerint, & virium robore valuerint. 
[/32./] 
Platerus doth require in the Causo or burning feuer, 
that there should be a liberall letting of bloud 
if strength do permit, because he thinketh it not to 
proceede of pure choler (as many other Phisitions 
haue taught) but of bloud putrified and inflamed 
in the great artery, and causing so much the 
more da~gerous feuer as it is kindled in the trunck 
of the great artery neerest vnto the heart. If Hippocrates 
do require Phlebotomy in morbis acutis, 
then must it needes be good in the burning feuer, 
[/33./] 
which, as Trincauell declareth is maximus & acutissimus 
morbus. But still in the quantity Hippocrates 
his rule must be obserued, to haue a due regard of 
the age and strength. 
 
[^p.13^] 
[}CHAP. 3. 
 
How bloud-letting may be admitted in agues caused 
by obstructions, as Diaries &c.}] 
 
[/34./] 
GAlen sheweth, that by obstructions sometimes 
the transpiration and vapouring out 
may be intercepted, and by the obstructions 
they which haue bad humours fall 
into agues, as Diaries and such like, and in them 
he requireth as very expedient the opening of a 
vayne, first for venting or euentilation: for as he 
saith, vnlesse the bad humour be vented, it must needs 
become putrified: and secondly, because those things 
which you shall minister afterward to deliuer 
from obstructions will worke more effectually. 
For it is best to come to deterge and loose obstructions, 
hauing first by bloud-letting (for he speaketh there 
of Phlebotomy) auoyded part of the euill humours. 
For we seeking to deliuer the obstructions before we 
haue made euacuation, it is in danger that we shall 
impact the obstructions more firmely then before. 
How the greatnesse of the obstruction shall be 
knowne, Galen sheweth a little after in the same 
booke, The declaration of the quantity of the obstruction 
[/35./] 
is made manifest by the ague: for vpon greater 
obstructions the ague is greater, and vpon lesse obstructions 
it falleth out to be lesse. Montanus being fallen 
[/36./] 
into the consideration of this place of Galen, 
doth make three seuerall kindes of obstructions, 
and sheweth in which of them bloud-letting 
is requisite, and in which not. The fyrst 
obstruction is when in the pores of the skinne 
in the outward parts the transpiration and vapouring 
[^p.14^] 
out is stayed and prohibited. The second 
kind of obstruction he calleth coarctatoria, 
when such a multitude of humours is conteyned 
within the vaynes, that the passage of the spirits 
being stopped, they cannot passe thorough the 
vaynes, whereby there commeth a perill of suffocation. 
The third obstruction is called oppilatio, 
whe~ some tough matter doth so stop the conduits 
and chanels of the vaynes, that neither matter nor 
spirits can passe thorough them. 
 
In the first kind of obstructions Phlebotomy is 
good, because by it the body is made more thin, 
and humors being without the vaines in the compasse 
of the skinne, are by bloudletting drawne 
into the vaines, and so do passe away, as Montanus 
doth demonstrate out of Galen. 
[/37./] 
 
In the second kind of obstruction letting bloud 
is also conuenient, that the thronging together of 
humours may cease, and that bloud may be vented. 
But in the third kind of obstruction it were 
ill done to let bloud, because the thick humour 
which is impacted in the first vaynes, is not thereby 
euacuated, but rather increased, as the same 
author doth proue out of the same fourth booke 
of Galen de sanitate tuenda. I thinke he hath respect 
[/38./] 
to that position of Galen: In a werisome and faint 
body there is little good bloud, and many raw humours. 
Phlebotomies do auoyd the good bloud, but as for the 
ill bloud which is gathered together in the first vaynes, 
especially that which is about the liuer and midbowels, 
they disperse and spread it throughout all the body. 
How in the two last kinds of obstructions the humour 
must be prepared and made fluxible, before 
we attempt any letting of bloud, it is to be declared 
[^p.15^] 
hereafter in the third Chapter of the second 
booke. But the question is here only of the first 
kind of obstructions, when in an ague called diaria 
or ephemera (which lasteth not aboue 24. howres) 
by reason either of the constipation or thicknes 
of the skinne the spirits and vapours haue lost 
their accustomable flowing out, whereby the spirits 
are inflamed, whether in this ague bloud is to 
be let or no? I answere, that according to the 
iudgement of many excellent Phisitions of our 
[/39./] 
time, this ague is best ouercome by causing kindly 
sweates, by medicins loosing obstructions, and by 
vsing fit bathes without letting of bloud. But if it 
do continue more then a day, that it be now diaria 
plurium dierum, or as some call it ephemera extensa, 
then all do agree that letting of bloud is very expedient, 
for feare least of an ague not putrified it 
do become a synochus putrida, and so bring greater 
danger. For as diaries or agues of one day do passe 
into diaries of many dayes, vnlesse the obstruction 
be loosed as Galen sayth; Vnlesse the obstruction be 
[/40./] 
cured they fall into agues of many dayes: so also the 
diaries of many dayes do fall into putrified agues 
and hectick feuers, vnlesse they be in time holpen 
and eased, as the same Galen sheweth in the first 
page of his ninth booke de methodo medendi. But 
concerning letting of bloud, Galen doth in the 
tenth booke generally set downe his iudgement 
very briefely concerning all diaries caused by obstructions. 
One obstruction commeth by multitude, 
[/41./] 
and an other by the quality of the humours being too 
tough, or too thick. In that which cometh by multitude, 
letting of bloud is the chiefest manner of 
curing, but in that which commeth by the quality 
[^p.16^] 
of the humour, the vse of the extenuating things is 
best.

MOntanus affirmeth, that in a phlegmatick 
ague, if the fleame be thick and of a glassy 
greene colour, as it falleth out in the agues 
called epialæ, then in no wise may any vayne 
be opened, because although there be a great boyling, 
yet we haue neede of a great heate, that the 
matter may be concocted, and the passages opened, 
and therefore he thinketh that we haue neede 
rather of frictions. But if it be pituita dulcis, such a 
fleame as may easily be conuerted into bloud, 
then he alloweth letting of bloud as a fit help to 
remoue the obstruction. He sheweth in the same 
place a little before, that the chiefest cause why we 
sometimes vse phlebotomy in quotidians & quartaines, 
[/43./] 
is to vent vapours. It respecteth not the 
multitude, but the quality, because it is done only to 
help the bubbling of the humour. In the tertian he 
sayth, that Phlebotomy is not necessary, neither 
euacuatiue, because there is no fulnesse of bloud, 
but only euill humours mixed with the bloud, 
nor yet Euentatiue, because the paroxysmes of 
the tertians continue not aboue twelue howres, 
and haue a great distance of intermission, and 
therefore can not haue so great a boiling as should 
neede to be vented with so great a remedie as is 
Phlebotomy. And as touching the quartaine, he 
sayth, that bloud-letting doth not agree vnto it of 
[^p.17^] 
it selfe as it dependeth of melancholick humour, 
but per accidens, as when it commeth vpon the supressing 
of the menstrua or hæmorrhodes, or when 
it commeth ratione sanguinis adusti by meanes of 
burnt bloud, then he alloweth the letting of bloud. 
[/44./] 
Platerus doth thinke that all intermitting agues 
do proceede of a putrified cause, lying hid in the 
mesaraick vaynes, and therefore if any of them 
could be opened, he supposeth some help might 
come: but seeing those mesaraick vaynes do no 
where appeare at the skinne, it were best not only 
in quartaines but also in tertians (if possibly it 
may be) to cause a flux of y=e= hæmorrhoids, because 
the hæmorrhodial vaynes are branches of y=e= mesaraik 
vaines. He will haue no vayne to be opened 
there, vnlesse it appeare exceeding well, because 
a small wound made there, doth bring oftentimes 
great torments: but he will haue either the flux to 
be procured by some medicine, or else leaches to 
be applied. He alloweth no phlebotomy in exquisite 
tertians, and such as are afflicted with most 
vehement heate, by reason of choler inflamed, 
neither doth he thinke it fit in phlegmatick agues, 
in which cases he which shall rashly and vnskilfully 
let bloud, shall not only auoid nothing of the 
cause lying hid in the mesaraik vaynes, but also as 
he sayth, the matter being plucked out of the mesaraick 
vaynes into the hollow vayne, he shall of an intermitting 
[/45./] 
ague make a continuall ague; or else, the purer bloud, 
by reason of emptying the branches of the hollow vayne, 
being drawne out of the mesaraick vaynes, that cholerick 
and putrified humour which remayneth (and 
whereunto bloud was before a bridle and a meanes to 
asswage it) will now become more fierce. Therefore he 
[^p.18^] 
concludeth, that in these kindes of agues more 
harme is done by admitting Phlebotomy then by 
omitting it, vnlesse some grieuous symptome do 
happen, that by the inflaming of bloud an inflammation 
also of some of the inward parts be feared, 
or vnlesse there be a plethora or plenitude in the 
body (which may be obserued by the rednes and 
thicknes of the vrine, and by the long continuing 
of the heate after the fit, and when there is no fit) 
then not in the beginning of the ague, but about 
the third or fourth fit, in the day of intermission, 
out of that vayne of the arme that appeareth most 
filled, it will do very well to let bloud 5. 6. 7. or 8. 
ou~ces. In quartains it must be done in y=e= left arme, 
[/46./] 
& somewhat later then in tertians: For quartaines 
are at the beginning gently to be handled, least a double 
quartain or a triple quartain be made, and least also the 
strength should decay, which heere we must preserue by 
reason of the long continuance of the disease. Fuchsius 
[/47./] 
in an exquisite tertian (which proceedeth of meere 
choler, not mixt with any other humour) doth 
proue out of Galen ad Glauconem, that neither letting 
of bloud, nor vehement purging medicine 
[/48./] 
can be conuenie~t for it. Doctor Brigthus doth thinke 
requisite that in the first day of intermission (to 
ventilate the body) 6. or 8 ounces of bloud be 
[/49./] 
taken. These iudgements do seeme to be contrary, 
but yet the seuerall circumstances being considered, 
they may both be very well reconciled. For as 
Fernelius sheweth the opening of a vayne in respect 
of it selfe is hurtfull to an exquisite tertian, it 
taketh away the profitable and necessary humour, and 
leaueth behinde the impure and hurtfull. Againe, in 
this kind of ague the body is wont to be very thin 
[^p.19^] 
and of little bloud: But the sharp choler which is the 
matter of the ague, and doth abound and boyle vnder 
the hollow part of the liuer when bloud is taken away 
doth waxe more fierce. Yet he alloweth there letting 
of bloud in respect of other symptomes, such 
as are headach, beating of the temples, and heauinesse 
of the body, in corpore plethorico. In tertiana 
notha, or the bastard tertian, where choler is for 
the most part mingled with fleame, or where choler 
doth not make it selfe the matter of the ague, 
but doth kindle other humours (which may be 
[/50./] 
knowen in that the pulse is much lesse, thinner and 
slower then the other, and the heate also lesse) then 
is no bloud to be taken at the beginning of the 
Ague; but afterward the matter being prepared, 
when the vrine doth appeare red and thick, a 
vayne may be opened the day going before the 
fit, and foure ounces of bloud may be taken. But 
if the bloud prooue thin and somewhat yellowish, 
then must you straightway suppresse it. In the 
melancholick quartaine if it come vpon the staying 
of any vsuall or naturall purging of bloud, 
then stirre vp that if you can: if you can not, then 
within the 14. or the 20. day let a little bloud out 
of the saluatella, if the stre~gth be weake; or otherwise 
out of the basilica of the left arme, hauing before 
giuen a clyster. But if the quartain do come 
ex atra bile of black choler, which hath fits beginning 
with lesse shaking, and those also shorter then 
the melancholick (for the melancholick continueth 
24. houres) and is also accompanyed with a 
sharp heat and vehement thirst, and with much 
more vnquietnes then the melancholick, then 
you may let bloud in the beginning foure or fiue 
[^p.20^] 
ounces out of the basilica of the right arme, and 
the next day after if strength will permit two or 
three ounces out of the saluatella of the left hand. 
If that the black choler do proceed of burnt bloud 
you may let out more then if it proceed of any other 
[/51./] 
humour. That learned Heurnius sayth, Black 
choler is ougly, and doth spring of some burnt humour; 
but melancholy is the very melancholick iuice or the 
dregs of bloud. These are of a nature farre differing. 
For to black choler are due those things which 
may pacify the fiercenes of it, as Violets, Endiue, 
and such like: but to melancholy are due such 
things as are moderately warme and opening, as 
the rootes of Capers, the aperitiue rootes, and 
such like, alwayes adioyning to them such things 
as haue vim humectandi a moystening force. And 
as in potions and medicins these two require a far 
differing methode, so also (as you haue alreadie 
heard) in the manner and time of letting of bloud. 
 
In the intermitting agues we must not haue a 
bare and naked respect only to the feuer it selfe, 
but we must heedily regard all the symptoms and 
dangers which may ensue by the meanes of other 
[/52./] 
accidets, as Trincauel in his Commentary vpon 
Galen ad Glauconem doth at large declare by the 
example of an exquisit tertian. An exquisit tertian 
(sayth he) was neuer in respect of it selfe counted 
amongst great diseases, and therefore Phlebotomy 
doth not properly appertayne vnto it. But 
in other respects it is not only profitable, but also 
necessary, when regarding the state of the body, 
our scope and purpose is to preuent and auoyd 
[/53./] 
future mischiefes. For often may an exquisite tertian 
passe either into an continuall ague, or into a burning 
[^p.21^] 
ague, when the body is full either of bloud or of choler. 
His reason is because bloud may by reason of the 
multitude putrifie: and also choler if it be much, 
and the strength do grow so weake that it neither 
can gouerne it nor expell it, it must needs more 
[/54./] 
and more putrifie. And also according to Hippocrates 
easily may a tertian be conuerted into a plurisy. 
For these causes (saith Trincauel) the opening 
[/55./] 
of a vayne may haue place in an exquisite tertian, 
but that according to Auicenna must be vntill the 
third fit. Thus in all intermitting agues, though 
not in all after the same manner, nor in the same 
time, nor in the same quantity, nor for the same 
end and purpose, that axiome of Galen holdeth 
firmely, that not onely in continuall agues but 
[/56./] 
also in all other agues whatsoeuer where any humour 
doth putrify, it is good to open a vayne. 
You haue his words and his reason in the first 
Chapter of this booke set downe at large in the 
first vse of Phlebotomy. One generall note to 
know in tertians and quartaines whether any 
bloud may be spared, is y=e= thinnesse and y=e= yellowishnesse 
of the bloud. For the same which D. Bright 
[/57./] 
doth write in bastard tertians, that if the bloud 
do proue thin or yellowish, we must straight stop. 
[/58./] 
The same doth Fuchsius require in quartaines, that 
if the bloud do appeare black and thick, such as 
is commonly in splenetick men, then we shall let 
the party bleede more largely; but if the bloud doe 
prooue thin and yellow, then must it be presently stayed: 
for such a humour is not vnprofitable, but as well by his 
substance as also by his quality it doth amend the thick 
and cold humours. 
 
Alexander Massaria chiefe Doctor and professor 
[^p.22^] 
of the Vniuersity of Padua, a man of excellent 
[/59./] 
iudgement, doth in his late treatise concerning 
Phlebotomy differ from the opinions of Platerus 
and Fernelius, as touching letting bloud in tertian 
agues; and alloweth letting bloud sometimes in 
exquisite tertians, and sometimes in bastard tertians, 
[/60./] 
alleaging the auctority of Galen, so that it be 
done [^GREEK OMITTED^], straight in the beginning, and 
other things duly considered, as the strength and 
plenitude, and due preparation of the body. And 
he wondereth, what Auicen should meane, when 
he sayth, that vpon immoderate bleeding cholerick 
[/61./] 
humours do more boyle and rage, whereby 
the patients are more inflamed, whereas experience 
doth testifie that vnseasonable or excessiue 
bleeding doth bring rather dropsies and cold and 
bad habits of body, then any boyling heate or inflaming. 
If in tertians the cholerick humours of 
the body be first drawne away and the bowels euacuated 
by a glister, and a fit time chosen for the 
opening of the vayne when the stomack is fasting 
and empty, I see no reason but the stomack and 
bowels should draw back sufficiently to keepe the 
mesaraick vaynes from sending any such store of 
humours into the hollow vayne, as should putrefy 
the bloud in it or the branches thereof. And the 
rather do I yeeld more to the iudgement of Massaria, 
then of Fernelius and Platerus in this point, 
because the most leaned and expert Phisition 
[/62./] 
Heurnius doth testifie, that in letting bloud in cholerick 
bodies we do often auoyd more choler then 
bloud, and by experience I haue found it very oft 
to do much good & bring present help towards the 
beginning of tertians, although after the fift or 
[^p.23^] 
sixt fit I haue not seene much good to come thereof. 
[/63./] 
But in quartain agues Massaria cleaueth to that 
of Galen, We must deale softly and gently with quartaine 
agues at the beginning, and neither vse any strong 
purging nor euacuation of bloud, vnlesse it do mightely 
abound: And if to him that openeth the vayne the 
bloud do appeare black and thick, such as especially is 
found in splenetick persons, let him let bloud the more 
boldly; but if it appeare yellow and thin, let him straightway 
suppresse it. 
 
[}CHAP. 5. 
 
Whether letting of bloud be to be admitted in the plague 
or pestilent feuer, as also in the Pox and such other 
contagious infirmities, and when and how.}] 
 
AVicenna in his eleuenth canon concerning 
[/64./] 
bloud-letting (as Montanus hath 
deuided them) doth set it downe for a 
rule, that in what agues soeuer there is a 
most vehement inflammation, there must be no 
letting of bloud. Montanus discoursing vpon that 
place, sayth, that we must regard not so much what 
the disease requireth, as what the strength can 
beare, In respect of the disease Phlebotomy doth agree, 
[/65./] 
but not in respect of the powers. He bringeth in 
an instance of a pestilent feuer, and sheweth that 
bloud is not to be let in it, because although of it 
selfe in regard of the pestilent feuer there is no 
greater remedie then letting of bloud, seeing that 
by it the body is made apt to vent and vapour out 
the spirits, the inward heate is extinguished, and 
putrified bloud is euacuated: yet if bloud be let all 
[/66./] 
do dye, and therefore we must absteine from Phlebotomy 
[^p.24^] 
in the pestilent feuer, because in a moment of time the 
strength vtterly decayeth. Platerus sheweth sundry 
[/67./] 
great dangers which letting of bloud doth bring 
vnto them that are infected with the plague, and 
that little good helpe can be expected thereby. 
I can not see how Phlebotomy can auayle to pluck that 
venemous quality from the heart, or to bring it out of 
the body together with the bloud, seeing that it is rather 
procured thereby, that the infection which from outwardly 
commeth into the body and doth presently infect 
the spirits, should be drawne more deeply inward. 
[/68./] 
And moreouer the motion of nature (whereby straightwayes 
in the first inuasion it goeth about to shake out 
the poyson by sweates, by outward pustles and by botches) 
may be hindred by letting of bloud, and the powers 
thereby weakened, which we ought to keepe strong to 
expell that poyson. It neither doth auoyd the cause of 
the disease, neither is there any neede heere of any euentilation 
of heate, seeing it is not heere so vehement. 
Hereupon he concludeth, that vpon rash and vnaduised 
letting of bloud in plague times many me~ 
are killed. Yet he acknowledgeth that when the 
plague hath taken hold vpon bodies which are 
summe plethorica vel cachectica, full of bloud or of 
corrupt humours whereby a feuer is kindled, then 
if by opening of a vayne the plenty and putrefaction 
of the bloud be taken away, all the other 
symptomes will become more tolerable: but that 
must be done sparingly, and with a due regard of 
the strength. And if in the beginning strength be decayed, 
then is Phlebotomy not to be admitted, though 
the fulnesse of the vaynes doe require it: for of lusty 
youthes we haue found by experience more to escape in 
the plague time without letting of bloud then by letting 
[^p.25^] 
of bloud. If Phlebotomy be vsed it must be done rather 
in respect of the feuer then of the pestilent qualitie, 
seeing that this venome doth not consist in the 
bloud, but comming from outwardly doth sodainely possesse 
the heart, and we do not thinke that it can be expelled 
or drawne out from it by Phlebotomy. And if 
the case do so stand that by the meanes of the plenitude 
and feuer a vayne must needs be opened, 
then he sheweth in what order it must be done. 
First, it must be done in the beginning: for vnlesse 
the vayne be opened within 24. howres of the beginning, 
it will rather hinder nature then do any 
good. Also it must be considered whether the 
party be in a sweate or no: for in no wise must the 
sweate be hindered by Phlebotomy. But after the 
party hath sweat and hath bin refreshed with a 
little meate or some cordiall receipt, then may a 
vayne be openend howsoeuer there hath gone no 
clyster nor purging before, because the time hath 
not giuen leaue. Choose the vayne in that side 
which is most grieued. If any eruption appeare about 
the flanck open the saphena. If in the vpper 
parts, then some vayne in the arme or hand of the 
same side. If vnder the arme-hole, take the basilica. 
If about the eares, the cephalica. If in the face, open 
the vayne vnder the tongue. And euer to the botches 
appearing, let cupping glasses be fastned, that 
the poyson may abide in the same place, and not 
by Phlebotomy be drawne into the inward parts. 
[/69./] 
Trincauel doth accompt it very dangerous to let 
bloud when pimples do outwardly appeare: but 
when as well by the pulse, as by the former manner 
of diet which the party hath vsed, it is found to 
be expedient; then let it be done straight in the beginning 
[^p.26^] 
before the putrefaction of the pestilent feuer be 
much increased; and before nature do seeke to expell 
vnto the skin. Thus he prooueth out of Galen, who 
[/70./] 
commenting vpon one of Hippocrates his patients 
called Crito, who dyed vpon a kind of pestilent feuer, 
he doth excuse Hippocrates and sayth that he 
did not let him bloud, because he was not sent for 
at the beginning of the disease. Which signifieth 
that if he had bin sent for at the beginning, a vaine 
no doubt should presently haue been opened. 
 
[/71./] 
Montanus in his epistle to Crato doth allow letting 
of bloud in the small pocks and such other 
contagious diseases, so that it be in the beginning 
before signes of putrefaction appeare: but when it hath 
once preuayled, then to let bloud he doth call it 
a pernitious and a deadly thing. For nature is then 
checked when it should wholy be intentiue to expell 
the venom and infection of the disease. Fernelius, 
[/72./] 
Hollerius, and Syluius, three famous and worthie 
Physitions, consulting about the sweating 
plague called sudor Anglicus, did deliuer to the 
English Embassadour the vse of bloud-letting amongst 
the meanes to preuent the disease, in full 
bodies, the bodies being first orderly purged: but 
the disease hauing once taken hold, they aduised 
no bloud-letting, but prescribed good cordials to 
expell from the heart the venemous infection. 
But in that which is commonly called by the name 
of Plague, although the body be already infected, 
yet if it be corpus plethoricum (the notes whereof 
are in the first Chapter of the booke next ensuing) 
wee may be bold to begin the cure with 
bloud-letting, obseruing as neere as may be the 
cautions before expressed, and especially taking 
[^p.27^] 
heed (as Montanus giueth warning) that wee 
[/73./] 
choose the vayne as farre as we can from the principall 
parts, from the heart, liuer, and braine, for 
if we draw the pestilent humour vnto them he 
sayth we shall kill the patient. 
 
[}CHAP. 6. 
 
How letting of bloud is to be vsed in phrensies, quinsies 
plurisies, inflammations of the raynes or wombe, and 
other inward inflammations happening often without 
agues.}] 
 
[/74./] 
IN the phrensy (which is a deprauing of 
all the principall faculties of the braine) 
caused by the inflammation of the filmes 
thereof) Rhazes doth allow Phlebotomy in the 
beginning of the disease, but not if it be a hectick 
phrensy of any continuance. Celcus doth affirme, 
that the face being red and the vaynes swelling, 
a vayne may be opened after the fourth day, if 
strength be sufficient. But if it come of a cholerick 
cause, then it should seeme to be ill done to let 
bloud, because as Heurnius obiecteth frænum bilis 
est sanguis, bloud is the bridle of choler. To this 
he answereth, Male sanguinem sine bile educeremus, 
imo plus bilis educimus quam sanguinis, Hardly can 
we auoyd bloud without choler, yea rather by 
Phlebotomy we do bring out more choler then 
bloud. And if it were done but only for deriuation 
sake, yet were it well done. But at what time must 
this Phlebotomy be vsed? Cælius Aurelianus sayth 
that it must be done within three dayes of the beginning, 
and not beyond, because in such diseases 
[^p.28^] 
the strength of the body is in perill. Aretæus also 
sayth, that it ought to be done either the first or the 
second day. If the phrensy begin after the fourth 
day, then open the vayne after the seauenth day: 
but if it do come in the sixth or seauenth day, then 
let no bloud, for that is a criticall phrensey. Aetius 
sayth, that if the phrensy do come with an ague 
any day before the fourth day, and signes of plenitude 
appeare, wee may well open the middle 
vayne. When the phrensy is old, letting bloud is 
not safe. Cælius sayth, that to let bloud after the 
eight day est iugulare homines, is nothing but to 
murder men. The quantity must be according to 
the cause. If it proceede of inflamed bloud, you 
may let bloud vsque ad animi deliquium, till the 
heart begin to fayle. For there is a vehement inflammation, 
[/75./] 
a very sharp feuer, and exceeding 
great griefe, in which three cases Galen alloweth 
large Phlebotomy. But if the bloud be much mixed 
with choler, then sixe ounces shall suffice, or if 
the party be strong, tenne ounces. Aretæus his opinion 
is, that if it haue the first beginning from the 
parts about the midriffe, then the party may bleed 
more largely, because thereabouts lyeth the fountayne 
of bloud. What you do you must do at once, for 
the disease doth giue no long truce. Trallianus commaundeth 
the vayne of the forehead to be opened. 
[/76./] 
But that Heurnius doth condemne, as ministring 
a further increase to the disease, especially if the 
phrensy come of bloud: for both the bloud should 
turne his course into the head, and also the euacuation 
should be made by the very place affected, 
which should be as he thinketh very inconuenient. 
The course which Heurnius doth best like 
[^p.29^] 
of, is this, first to open the midle vayne of the arme, 
and after to open either the vayne of the forehead, 
or the vayne vnder the tongue. 
 
For the Quinsie or squinancie, the swelling of 
[/77./] 
the throate, causing difficultie of breathing, and 
hardnesse of swallowing, Trincauel doth aduise a 
speedie letting of bloud; yet a glister being vsed 
before if the disease will giue leaue: but if the disease 
(as it is a very sharp disease) will giue no space, 
[/78./] 
then may we do as Hippocrates sometime did, that 
is, first let bloud, & afterward minister the Clyster. 
Fuchsius willeth vs to open the basilica of the arme 
of the same side where the swelling is. But he will 
[/79./] 
haue it to be done at seuerall times by little and 
little, and not all at once, least there should happen 
a swouning, and so a perill of suffocation: and 
besides, By two sodaine coolings and by fainting of the 
heart, the matter may be caryed from the iawes vnto 
the lungs, and so bring ineuitable danger. Yet must not 
the incision be made too little, least by the meanes of 
the narrownesse of the hole the good bloud should be 
as it were strained out, and the thick part remaine within, 
which is the cause of the griefe. If the patient be a 
woman whose termes are stayed, open first the 
saphena, and then the vaine vnder the tongue. For 
the pleurisy, how conuenient bloud-letting is for 
it, it is a thing so well knowen to all men, that 
there needeth no proofe thereof. But on what side 
the vayne must be taken, whether on the same 
side that hath the inflammation, or on the contrary 
side, seeing that there is amongst learned 
Phisitions a great controuersie about that matter, 
I haue appoynted one Chapter, to wit, the Chapter 
next following, wholy for the discussing of that 
[^p.30^] 
question. And for as much as also all the arguments 
layd open in that disputation do as well 
concerne the inflammation of the raynes and of the 
wombe, and all other inward inflammations as 
the plurisy, I haue thought it good to speake no 
more of the particulars heere, but rather to conclude 
[/80./] 
with that generall speech of Galen. To speake 
briefly, when inflammations do begin, we must euacuate 
them by reuulsion (that is, pluck it back into the parts 
furthest distant) but when they are of long continuance, 
we must empty them out of the places affected, or 
as neere vnto those parts as we can. For at the beginning 
of inflammations it is good to turne back that 
which floweth, but when they haue remayned a long 
time, we must auoyd and expell that which is impacted 
and fastened in the part affected. 
 
[}CHAP. 7. 
 
In these dangerous inflammations aforenamed, whether 
euacuation or reuulsion be more necessary, and 
what is the meaning of Hippocrates his rule [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
to worke directly, and with a right course of 
flowing.}] 
 
PEtrus Brissotus, and Matthæus Curtius, 
two learned Phisitions, the one a Frenchman, 
and the other an Italian, haue by 
many arguments prooued, that in pleurisy the 
vayne ought still to be opened in the arme of the 
[/81./] 
same side where the griefe lyeth. Trincauel in his 
treatise which he calleth rudimentum, hath vndertaken 
to confute them. The first reason of Brissotus 
[/82./] 
is, because in such sharp diseases, vnlesse you help 
presently the party dyeth. And the first scope in an 
[^p.31^] 
inflammation is to auoyd bloud out of the place 
inflamed, for the performance whereof the same 
side is most conuenient. Trincauel answereth, that 
when the party hath no full body, then that position 
may well stand. But if there be a full body, 
then he holdeth with Galen, that the scope and 
purpose of the Phisition must be to forbid that the 
bloud shall not flow to the place of griefe. For the 
flux of the bloud doth Galen make to be the cause 
[/83./] 
of the vehement inflammation. And this staying 
of the flowing of bloud he thinketh may best be 
done by euacuating, so that we may also reuell the 
same by drawing it back to the contrary side. Brissotus 
againe obiecteth, that by reuulsion there is 
[/84./] 
often stirred vp a pleurisy on the other side, vnto 
which the reuulsion is made. Trincauell doth answere, 
that doth happen by meanes of the fulnesse 
of the whole body, especially of the lower parts, 
when the opening of the vpper vaynes can not 
auoyd so much as is drawne vpward out of the inferior 
parts of the body: whereupon the humour 
following, the motion which is made by the force 
of the vayne cut, setling on that side, doth giue an 
occasion of a new inflammation. And therefore 
when there is a plenitude in the whole body, especially 
about the lower parts of the belly, he doth 
greatly commend the custome practised for many 
yeares with good successe by the Phisitions of 
Venice, to wit in this, to open the vayne about the 
knee, or about the ankle. And he sheweth, that in 
his owne experience in the same time that he was 
writing that treatise, he cured an old man of 60. 
yeares of age (who hauing a body vere plethoricum, 
was fallen into a plurisie) by causing a vayne to 
[^p.32^] 
be opend hard by the anckle. If Hippocrates did 
sometimes open the vayne in the arme of the same 
[/85./] 
side where the pleurisie did lye (as Trincauel doth 
make accompt he did in the curing of Anaxion the 
Abderite) it was because the disease was fully made, 
and the matter already flowed. But in the beginning 
of the flowing of the humour, neither Hippocrates 
nor Galen do allow the same kinde of euacuation, 
which afterward they admit when the flux is already 
[/86./] 
made. Hippocrates sayth, If humours be caryed 
into that part which they ought not, we must reuell 
them, but if they flow the same way they ought, then to 
open the passage to them according as euery one is bent. 
[/87./] 
And what his iudgement is touching this matter, 
you haue it set downe in the end of my Chapter 
last going before, and also toward the end of my 
first Chapter, where are cited the words of Galen 
concerning an vlcer caused of a flow, that if the 
flowing be vehement we must pluck it back into 
the contrary parts, but when it doth cease and rest 
setled in a place, then is it best to deriue it. Vpon 
[/88./] 
which point also Galen doth inferre there a generall 
conclusion. It is a generall thing that when fluxes 
doe begin, wee must vse reuulsion; but when they are 
setled in any affected part, then euacuate them either 
from the same place, or from some other place as neere 
as can be. He speaketh there of purging by medicins, 
but in the 13. and 14. booke of the same 
method of healing, he requireth the same order 
likewise in letting of bloud, and repeateth againe 
[/89./] 
as a generall axiome, euer make the reuulsion to the 
furthest parts off. So commenting vpon Hippocrates, 
he biddeth vs first make reuulsions, and afterward 
set vpon the contraries, to make locall euacuations 
[^p.33^] 
as he himselfe doth expound it by the 
[/90./] 
example of griefe in the hinder part of the head, 
which is taken away by opening the vayne of the 
forehead. And so in an other place, if the right leg 
haue an inflammation, he appoynteth a vayne to 
be opened in the left. Fuchsius hath framed sundry 
answeres to those testimonies of Galen in the 13. 
booke of his Methodus therapeutica. First he saith, 
that his generall axiome, that reuulsion must be 
made alwayes to places furthest distant, can in no 
wise be wrested vnto letting of bloud, seeing that 
Galen doth not speake there of letting of bloud, 
but of purgings, vomits, cupping-glasses, and such 
like. I wonder that Fuchsius should make that answere, 
seeing that Galen doth not only often in the 
leaues last going before make mention of Phlebotomy, 
but also when he hath made this generall 
precept with [^GREEK OMITTED^], semper, alwayes reuell to the furmost, 
he sayth in the lines next following, that he 
hath spoken of this in his bookes of Plenitude and 
Phlebotomy. These things are written in my bookes 
[/91./] 
of fulnesse and bloud-letting. Secondly, Fuchsius saith 
further, aliquando venæ sectione ad longinqua reuellimus, 
sed hoc fit in futuro morbo, sometimes we make 
reuulsion by bloud-letting into places farre distant, 
but that is when the disease is to come. If 
Fuchsius confesse so much, then he agreeth with 
Auicen, Montanus, Trincauell, and such as hold 
with them. For they all do teach that reuelling into 
places furthermost distant is not alwayes requisite, 
but only in the beginning, when the humour 
is yet flowing, before the humour be setled, 
antequam sit morbus factus, before it be a disease 
made, and that is indeed in futuro morbo. Thirdly, 
[^p.34^] 
for that place where Galen doth bid that if the one 
leg haue an inflammation, we should let bloud in 
the other: Fuchsius answereth, that Galen doth 
speake in that place of scarifying, that when one 
leg hath gotten an inflammation we must scarify 
the other, because scarifying doth stirre vp a griefe 
and payne, and dolor attrahit, griefe draweth the 
flux to the place scarifyed. But I maruaile that 
Fuchsius would not take the words as Galen hath 
set them downe. Galen speaketh plainely in that 
place not only of scarifying, but also of bloud-letting, 
[/92./] 
his words are these: We must either open a 
vayne, or scarify the places not affected, as the hand being 
grieued to take the leg, or the one leg being pained, 
the other. 
 
Fuchsius hauing obiected the practise of some 
which first do diminish the plenitude by opening 
the saphena, or else the basilica of the contrary 
arme, and after do take away the reliques out of 
the same side where the griefe lyeth, doth cry out 
against this counsayle of the Arabian Phisitions 
with the same words that Fernelius also doth, What 
[/93./] 
an od counsaile is this to torment the patient so often 
when you may with one act ease him of his payne? But 
although these two were both of them famous and 
learned men, yet as good Phisitions as they doe 
prescribe the act of letting of bloud to be often repeated 
either in one day or in dayes immediatly 
following, and yet are in very good hope that 
they doe not thereby torment the patient, but 
[/94./] 
worke much more for his ease. Mercurialis giuing 
counsaile to one which in a cough did spit bloud, 
sayth, If the casting vp of bloud do remayne, it would 
like me well that bloud should often be let a little at 
[^p.35^] 
once out of either arme, and therewithall rubbings and 
bindings applyed both to the anckles and to the knees. 
Montanus who doth as much reuerence Auicenna, 
[/95./] 
as Fuchsius and Fernelius do persecute him. For he 
sayth of him, Auicen was a most diuine man, a follower 
of Galen, and to be preferred over all that haue 
drawne their learning out of Galen: We haue Greeke 
translators (as he nameth there Aetius, Paulus Ægineta, 
and Oribasius) but compare them with Auicen 
and they are nothing. And a little after he sayth, we 
[/96./] 
must know that Auicen doth neuer speake any thing 
but what was before approued by antiquity. This Montanus 
as in other points he commendeth Auicenna, 
so in the seuerall states of pleurisy he alloweth 
[/97./] 
his iudgment, that first bloud be drawne from the 
saphena, then from the opposite vayne of the arme, and 
last of all from the same side: The first taketh away the 
multitude; the second maketh the diuersion, and the 
third doth empty the place affected. For the diuersion 
to the contrary part Montanus doth not only alleage 
the auctority of Auicenna and the Arabians, 
but of Archigenes and of Aretæus. Aretæus is 
brought in giuing his reason, If there should be multitude 
of bloud and you should draw it from the side 
where the pleurisie is, either you must draw it plentifully 
to fainting and swouning, and so the patient should 
either dye, or get an impostume in the lungs, or else 
you must draw a little, and so choake and stifle the party 
diseased, because (the plenitude being so great) much 
more will flow then shall be auoyded.
