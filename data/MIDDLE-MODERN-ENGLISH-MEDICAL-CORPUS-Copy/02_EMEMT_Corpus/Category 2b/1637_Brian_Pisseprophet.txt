[}The Pisse-prophet.}] 
 
[}CHAP. I. 
 
Wherein is shew'd the errour of the common people 
(who thinke that Diseases are to be discerned by 
the Urine) and the fallacies of the Physician, 
who intimate the same unto them: As also, 
what is to be considered of the Physician before 
he pronounce his judgement of an Urine.}] 
 
THE vulgar sort are so strongly 
prepossest (by reason of their 
ignorance) that Physicians can 
discern (by the Urine) the Disease, 
the conception, the sexe, 
the parties age, with many other 
such absurdities that I feare it will bee an 
hard matter to dispossesse them of that opinion. 
And Physicians (the more too blame they) have 
intimated and pretended this knowledge unto 
them so farre, as that they will hardly acknowledge 
their errours, and relinquish this basery. 
But when it shall appeare that the Urine is altogether 
[^p.2^] 
deceitfull, and the Physician (that pretendeth 
knowledge of Diseases thereby) to give his 
judgement of it by such fallacies and jugling as 
shall be shewed and set forth by me in this ensuing 
Discourse: Let the ignorant choose whether 
he will believe his lying oracle or no, and let the 
Physician choose whether hee will be honester 
than to use such deceit. Yet (I hope) the one will 
blush to have been so deluded, and the other to 
have his conjecturing discovered. And now mee 
thinks you long to heare how it is (the Urine giving 
no certaine knowledge of any Disease in the 
world) that Pisse-mongers (for they deserve not 
the name of a Physician that pretend knowledge 
of Diseases by it) doe give judgement of it, and 
make thee beleeve that they discerne Diseases by 
it, than the which nothing in the world is more 
false. But would you so faine know how this can 
be? Why thus it is, for I will now hold you no 
longer in expectation; I must therefore give unto 
your speciall consideration two things, (and then 
I will descend to all the particular Quillets and 
fallacies that deceive the ignorant) used in the 
contemplation and beholding of an Urine, which 
make a man presume to give judgement of Diseases 
by it. Observe now with me, that the two 
things to be considered are these: namely, that 
[/1./] 
Diseases are either acute, sharpe, and violent, as 
the Plurisie, Peripneumonia (which is the Apostumation, 
and inflamation of the Lungs) the Phrenzie, 
Iliaca Passio, the small Pox, Pestilence, and 
[^p.3^] 
every sharp Fever; Or else diseases they are Chronicall 
(that is of continuance) and lingring, such 
as proceed from the ill temperature of the humours 
and disposition of the constitution of the 
body, such as are the Consumption, Dropsie, Melancholy, 
Gout, Palsie, Falling-Sicknesse, Chachexia 
(which is a depravation of the humours of 
the body, whereby it taketh away, in man or woman, 
the appetite from meat, makes the body unfit 
for exercise, and marres the livelinesse of the spirits 
and countenance) and this disease in women 
is commonly called the Greene-Sicknesse, and it 
makes both men and women Greene indeed. But 
(to omit all circumstances that may be) the Physician 
alwayes beares these two considerations in 
minde, namely, that diseases are either Acute, 
Sharpe, and Violent, or Chronicall, and of continuance, 
and more gentle, as aforesaid, &c. Now, 
for the most part, the common sort of people come 
or send their Waters unto Physicians for Acute, 
Sharpe, and Violent diseases: as the Countrey-man 
or Handycrafts-man (who use to labour) for 
some Surfet (as they call it) taken by catching cold 
(as they thinke) after sweating at their severall labours, 
and your better sort of people (as they 
thinke themselves, because they use no labour) 
for a Surfet taken by idlenesse, as sitting in the 
Sunne, walking, sporting, drinking of Wine, eating 
over-much, or such meat as their stomach hath 
not well digested, and the like. You must likewise 
[/2./] 
note, that every sharpe disease hath an hot and burning 
[^p.4^] 
Fever joyned with it, and that the Urine (for 
the most part) in a burning Fever, is of an intense 
high red colour; and this colour, amongst all the 
other uncertaine signes of Urine (which seeme to 
shew a disease, to put a difference betweene 
sharpe and Chronicall diseases and to discover a 
Fever only) is the most certaine of all other, and 
yet uncertaine in it selfe. Such a Urine being 
[/3./] 
brought unto a Physician to cast (as they call it) 
and being of a red high colour (as I said before) 
he presently conceives it to be a sharpe and violent 
disease, and then knowes for certaine, that 
there is a Fever joyned with it; so he is now 
quickly prepared to give his judgement of it, and 
needs now to doe no more, but to give a description 
of a Fever, to make the messenger beleeve that 
he perceives the disease in the Water; but yet he 
comes to the true knowledge of the disease, by 
some such parly and expostulation had with the 
messenger, as shewes the symptomes and affects 
of the sick partie (though he seeme to have named 
them in the description of the disease to the messenger) 
which truly determine the disease: and 
then he names the disease, looking upon the Water 
(as if it were there to be found) in such manner 
as shall be hereafter shewed; which makes the 
messenger to beleeve so indeed. Now the description 
of a Fever (and indeed one description will 
serve for any Fever, and for all sharpe and violent 
diseases) is but to reckon up the Symptomes and 
signes of a Fever (the which we know before that 
[^p.5^] 
ever we looke upon the Water) which are these: 
namely, great oppression of the stomach by choler, 
or some other humour, which causeth want of appetite 
[/4./] 
to meat; oppilation and obstruction of the 
liver and spleene, causing great heat (which causeth 
great drought, and much desire of drinke) 
causing great paine in the head and backe, which 
likewise causeth want of sleepe and rest, from 
whence proceedeth (oftentimes) raving, franticke 
doting, senselesse and idle talke. Now to say that 
the sicke party is thus affected (for indeed so they 
are for the most part in every respect, but at the 
least in some kinde, in every violent disease) makes 
the messenger to thinke, that the Doctour doth 
perceive (that the partie is so affected) by the 
Urine, which (by Yea and by Nay) is no such matter: 
for he dares not alway trust to this high red 
Urine, as an infallible signe of a Fever; for it may 
[/5./] 
chance to be of such a colour by some other accident, 
when the partie that made it, is free from a 
Fever. But admit that the high red colour of the 
Urine did alway (as it doth for the most part) import 
a Fever, yet the Symptomes and companions 
of a Fever (as heat, drought, thirst, paine in the 
head, want of sleepe, oppression of stomach, want 
of appetite, oppilation of the liver and spleene, or 
any one of these) are not therein to be seene, 
though it please his worship to play the Anticke 
with the Water, pretending that there are such 
marks in it, as shew all these things that I have 
named. Neither doth he presume to name these 
[^p.6^] 
Symptomes (as heat, drought, thirst, &c.) from any 
signes thereof in the Urine, but for that he knoweth 
by dayly experience, that the fore-named 
Symptomes and companions of a Fever (as heat, 
drought, thirst, &c.) are necessarie consequences, 
and inseparable concomitants of a Fever: And 
yet (oh the pride of man, in seeming to be what 
he is not!) the Pisse-Prophet doth pretend, that he 
perceiveth all these things in the Water. These 
things being premised, I hope thou wilt be the 
better able to judge of that which followeth, and 
perceive how easie a thing it is to give judgement 
of diseases by the Urine (though it be not there to 
be seene) and wilt conceive the fallacies that uphold 
this custome, and so learne to put a difference 
betweene an honest learned plaine-dealing Physician 
and a prating Empirick, and a Rogue. I will 
now (for this once) imagine my selfe to be one 
of them, and to be in my Chamber or Study ready 
addressed to come forth, to give my judgement 
upon that high red Water (that importeth a Fever, 
and so a violent disease) that I last spake of, and 
will plainely shew you (by the examination of 
three such severall Urines, brought by three severall 
messengers) in three severall Chapters, how 
to give judgement of all acute, sharpe, and violent 
diseases, by the last description of the Symptomes 
of a burning Fever. 
 
[^p.7^] 
[}CHAP. II. 
 
What manner of persons your Pisse-messengers are, 
how they are handled, deluded, and made to shew 
how the sicke partie is affected, and yet to beleeve 
that the Doctour perceiveth the Disease by 
the Vrine.}] 
 
I Have here already such a Messenger (attending 
my leisure to give my judgement upon 
such a Urine) who, being conducted to my 
presence, salutes my worship with good morrow 
Master Doctour, and indeed the morning is the 
most usuall and fit time for the viewing of Urines: 
The Queane at Darkin hath gotten that Art, that 
she would not prophesie thereof after eleven of 
the clocke: And having thus saluted me, presents 
me the Urine, saying, Sir I desire your opinion of 
this water, and to tell me (though the sick partie 
know that too too well already) what the partie 
ayleth, and what the Disease is; the messenger 
(whether man or woman) you must note, is one 
who is, as it were, made out of waxe, whom a 
Physician cannot deceive (neither would hee if 
he could) nor yet learne any thing out of him 
couching the Disease, unlesse hee himselfe first 
have named it, and yet hee will make a shift to 
mould him into any forme that shall fit his purpose 
[^p.8^] 
best, and make him by impertinent questions 
(as he shall thinke) to tell him any thing, concerning 
the sicke partie, that hee shall desire 
to know, and yet (like Hocus Pocus who makes 
his ignorant spectatours to thinke that the Balls 
are under the Cups, though hee have conveyed 
them away by sleight of hand, and when 
they see that, to deeme him a Conjurer) to thinke 
that he hath discovered nothing, and me to be a 
skilfull Physitian and an honest man, when as 
indeed there is no such matter; for neither is 
Hocus Pocus a Conjurer, though by his nimble 
conveyance he have deluded his filly beholder, 
or so much a knave as they thinke him, because 
he hath not done it by any unlawfull assistance; 
neither am I so skilfull a Physitian, though I have 
made the messenger beleeve that I perceive 
strange things by the Water, because I doe but 
deceive the messenger; nor so honest a man as I 
am esteemed, though I carry the matter very faire, 
because I doe not ingenuously confesse to the 
messenger, and so to every body else when I shall 
have occasion to discourse about it, that there is 
no certaine judgement of any disease by the Urine 
but out of pride pretend knowledge of diseases 
by it, and to backe this knowledge blush not to 
use such deceit and fallacies as hereafter follow. 
[/6./] 
But now to returne to the Urine from the Physician 
and the fool, the Messenger: This Urine 
brought out of the Countrie, is for the most part 
in a glasse-bottle, but (if ones in the Citie) it 
[^p.9^] 
brought in an Urinall; it is likewise red and high 
of colour, and that (for the most part) betokeneth 
a Fever. I now therefore (before that ever I can 
poure the water out of the bottle, or take the Urinall 
out of the Case) rip up all the Symptomes 
of a Fever, and say, This partie hath a great oppression 
of stomach and no appetite to meat, a 
great oppilation and obstruction of the Liver and 
Spleene, is very hot and dry, desireth much to 
drinke, hath a great paine in the head and can 
take no rest, and was taken in the manner of an 
Ague with a grooving in the backe and paine in 
the head, first cold and then hot, reckning up all 
these things (as if I saw them there so soone as 
ever I looke into the water) so fast as ever I can 
make my tongue belie my heart. And with this 
description I have made the messenger admire my 
readinesse and skill in judging of Urines, and he 
verily beleeves that I have espied these things in 
the water; but is is farre otherwise; for these 
things (that I have reckoned up) are but the usuall 
Symptomes and companions of a Fever and the 
most of them are joyned with every Fever, and all 
of them and many moe at once are complicate 
with many a Fever. These things being so, I cannot 
but have hit the nayle on the head, for some 
of those Symptomes that I have reckoned up, must 
needs accompany the disease; and when I have 
once named them, the messenger presently answers, 
that the partie is just so affected as I have 
said: But (as yet) I have not named the disease, and 
[^p.10^] 
perhaps omitted something which is expected 
that I should have named: and the messenger is 
as ready then to aske me if I perceive nothing 
else by the water, as I was to pronounce my judgment 
of it before: To whom I answere, yes if 
you will give me leave to tell you; and then perchance 
askes me if I doe not perceive a stitch, and 
whether the party have not a Plurisie, I answer 
(looking upon the water as if it were there to be 
perceived) yes I well perceive the stitch, and 
some cough too; and I say, that when the cough 
takes the partie, the partie is much pained in the 
side; and for as much as I did not name the stitch 
at first, I tell the messenger that we use first to declare 
the cause of the disease before we come to 
every passion or affect of the disease, or before we 
name it: I further adde that I was not yet come 
to speake of the stitch (no nor should never have 
found it out of the water, had not the messenger 
bolted it out) because I had named the cause therof, 
namely, the oppression of the stomach and obstruction 
of the Spleene, and mesentery, and that 
the stitch was nothing else but a flatuous and 
windie humour proceeding from thence to the 
place affected; so now I determine the disease 
to be (as they suppose) a Plurisie; And indeed 
they can better define their owne diseases by the 
Symptomes and passions that they suffer, than any 
Physician can doe by the water onely. But now 
as I have been happy in my predictions of the 
disease, and rightly determined it to be (as it is 
[^p.11^] 
indeed) a Plurisie; so now I must proceed to the 
prescription (as it is required) of such remedies 
as may cure this Plurisie: And now I am here as 
farre to seeke (though I know the disease to be a 
Plurisie) as if I knew not the disease at all, nor 
had seen the Urine, because I doe not therein perceive 
the scope and grounds of prescribing fit remedies 
(according to the rules of Art) in every 
respect proper to the disease; The which scope and 
[/7./] 
grounds are these (namely) the parties age, the 
sexe, the constitution of the body, and the strength 
of it at this time, with divers other accidents, as 
whether the party be bound in his body, or have 
a flux and scouring, or the like: All the which nor 
any one of them can be discerned by the Urine, & 
yet I must finde them there if the messenger refuse 
to tell me (but that they seldome refuse to doe 
after that I have given them a description of the 
disease, and shewed them in some part how the 
partie is affected) or else I must needs erre in my 
prescription; for if I should prescribe (not knowing 
the age of the partie) such a quantitie of 
blood to be taken away from a young youth (suppose 
ten or twelve ounces) in a Pluresie, which is 
the disease in hand, as should be taken from a man 
in his full strength, the partie might perish thereby; 
or if I should take but foure or five ounces of 
bloud from a lusty young man (in this disease) at 
his full strength, I should doe him no good, and so 
he might perish on the other side: I might likewise 
erre in the dose, if (not knowing the parties 
[^p.12^] 
age) I should prescribe more or lesse than were 
proportionable to the parties age in prescribing 
purging Potions or Clysters in this case; I might 
likewise commit no lesse errour if (not knowing 
the sexe) I should in the forenamed disease prescribe 
blood-letting to a woman, her naturall 
courses being broke forth upon her; for I might 
by that accident expect a solution of the disease 
without blood-letting. I might likewise erre, 
if (knowing the sexe) I should prescribe purging 
Physicke for a woman in this case (not knowing 
whether she be with child or no) of such a quality 
as might cause her to miscarry: I might erre concerning 
the constitution of the body if I should 
(not knowing the same) prescribe that for a 
weakly constitution of body which were fitter 
for a robustuous and strong constitution: and so 
on the contrary. I might likewise erre if I should 
(not knowing the strength of the body at this 
time) prescribe too strong a Potion, or too much 
blood to be taken away, when the disease hath 
overcome the strength and the partie is too much 
debilitated, or if I should prescribe too gentle a 
potion, or too little blood to be taken away when 
the strength is not yet dejected, but stands in equall 
contestation with the disease. I could shew 
a thousand wayes more how I could erre, and how 
most Physitians doe erre that prescribe Physicke 
by the sight of the Urine only: But my intent is 
to shew how many thousand wayes I could deceive 
thee and make thee beleeve that I discerne 
[^p.13^] 
all these things by the Urine (as thou thinkst I do) 
namely the disease, the parties age, sexe, strength, 
constitution of body, and the like: I have therfore 
digressed herein from my purpose (since my intent 
was not to shew the errors that are committed by 
such as pretend knowledge of diseases by the Urine, 
but to shew the fallacies and jugling that they 
use in giving judgment of it) and so frustrated thy 
expectation of this dainty Art; but I hope it shall 
be to thy profit, for thou shalt hereby be the better 
able to give thy Physitian such instructions as 
he shall require, and shalt perceive the danger of 
taking Physick prescribed by the sight of the Urine 
only: And now to the purpose indeed; but first 
imagine with me, that the last messenger, having 
received good satisfaction by the description of 
the parties disease for whom he came, was ready 
to certifie me of all the forenamed circumstances 
that were requisite for me to inquire of, as the 
parties age, sexe, constitution of body, present 
strength, how long the partie had been sicke, &c. 
And I have sent him away with such remedies as 
[/8./] 
were most proper for his Pleurisie, directions for 
blood-letting to mitigate his Fever, some pectorall 
Physick to ease his cough, with a Liniment to 
mollifie, and to dispell wind, to anoynt his side 
withall for his stitch, and wish him to repaire unto 
me again within a day or two to certifie me of the 
successe of the Physicke, and how the partie stands 
now affected, that if need require, I may supply 
him with further advise. Now in all this (I hope) 
[^p.14^] 
I have not erred, save only that I forgot to tell the 
messenger that the partie was very dangerously 
sicke, and would hardly recover, but yet I have 
prescribed him the best meanes that can, by the art 
of man, be for his recoverie, and I pray God to give 
his blessing, and so I have quite dispatched this 
messenger. And now whether the partie live or 
dye I shall be sure to be magnified for my skill; if 
he die, for that my predictions prove true; and if 
he live, for that I recovered him of so dangerous 
a disease. And now I am ready to encounter with 
the next messenger, who likewise brings me another 
Urine of an high red colour, in giving judgement 
upon which I will plainely shew how a man 
may give judgement of all other sharpe and violent 
diseases by the water (though it doe not certainely 
shew any Symptomes of any disease, which 
determine the same) and how thou shalt get out of 
the messenger every circumstance necessary to the 
judging and determining of a disease, as the age, 
sexe, and strength of the partie, and to the guiding 
of a man in prescribing of fit remedies, and 
yet he shall not perceive but that thou findest 
them in the Urine; Sed hoc est decipere, non judicare; 
but this is to juggle, and not to judge. 
 
[^p.15^] 
[}CHAP. III. 
 
The craftiest messengers must be the more craftily 
handled: the action and gesture of the Physician 
in giving judgement of an Vrine: that we come 
to the knowledge of the disease, and sex by impertinent 
questions (as they thinke) put to the messengers, 
and not by the Vrine: the cunning tricks 
that Physicians have to make the messengers confident 
of their (falsly) pretended skill; and the 
flammes that they have to evade censure, if they 
chance to erre in the pronouncing of their judgement.}] 
 
SUppose this next messenger to be some 
Nurse or tender of sick persons, who is commonly 
versed, and accustomed in carrying 
sick folks Urines unto Physicians; and she salute 
me, with Master Doctor, I have brought you a 
Water, and desire your opinion of it: and now I 
am like to have a hard taske of it, and to be so 
put to my trumps, that (if I play not my cards sure) 
I shall lose the set, miscarry in my judgement, be 
accounted a dunce, and lose my patient for ever; 
but I will be aware of that, I warrant you. I now 
[/9./] 
therefore take this crafty wench to doe, and I will 
handle her as craftily; I take the Vrinall of her, and 
bid her come from the doore of my Parlour, Study, 
[^p.16^] 
or Chamber (where they commonly stand,) 
unto the window, or light, where I commonly 
give my oracle; and indeed, a man had need of 
a good light, and a better sight, that shall perceive 
all these things that I must find out of this Urine. 
Being come to the light (as I am uncasing the 
Urinall to looke upon it,) I aske the Nurse a question, 
not whose water it is (for that she is enjoyned, 
nay conjured, not to tell me, especially if 
it be a womans, nor any thing else, unlesse I first 
find it out of the water) but my question is; How 
long the party hath beene sick; And she out of 
modesty and good manners, can doe no lesse but 
answer me to this question, for she thinkes this 
question to be but words of course, and that I 
can gather nothing from hence touching the parties 
disease; and so she answeres me a weeke, a 
forthnight, two or three dayes, or more or lesse. 
But from hence I collect and have strong presumptions 
that it is an acute disease; and if she say, 
A forthnight, I shall thinke it to be only an acute 
disease and of the lesse danger, unlesse there have 
another Physician beene imployed already, the 
which I shall be sure to know, and if there have, 
I shall go neere to strike his nose out of joynt, and 
gaine the patient to my selfe, and then (if I recover 
him) I shall get immortall fame; but if he 
chance to die, I will make a shift to shuffle off the 
disgrace upon my brother Doctor, for that (as I 
will say) such and such meanes were not used at 
the first, though haply he have used as good a methode 
[^p.17^] 
as my selfe could have done: But if she say 
that the party hath beene sick a weeke, I shall 
thinke it is a more acute disease, whether there 
have another Physician beene imployed or no. 
But if she say three or foure dayes, I then presume 
that it is a most sharpe disease, and now I 
will so plant and interest my selfe in the party, 
as that I will prevent anothers comming there, 
unlesse it be to a person of quality, and then I will 
be as ready to desire another Physician to be called, 
as the sick party shall be to request it, not so 
much that I desire his aide, or would have him 
partake with me in the booty, as in the disgrace, if 
the party should chance to die. And now I know 
(by this question, as also the Water, being high 
and red, witnessing the same) that it is an Acute 
disease: And now I take the Urinall in my hand, 
and hold it up to the light, and (looking very little 
upon it) I shake it together, and set it downe very 
artificially in the window asloop, as if I meant 
to inquire further of it anone, and that it must 
stand so a while; and indeed it must stand so a 
while, and I must looke but lightly upon it at 
first, or else I shall not have so good an evasion if 
I erre never so litle, nor so fit an opportunity to 
propound another question to the setting me forward 
in the pronouncing of my opinion, or to the 
inquiry of some other circumstance (necessary to 
the guiding me in prescribing fit remedies) as the 
parties Age, Sexe, Strength, and the like, for this 
wench will be sure to hold me to my text. And 
[^p.18^] 
now go along with me still, and conceive with me 
that it is a sharp disease (as appeareth by her answer) 
and that I have no sooner asked her how long the 
party hath beene sick, and set downe the Urinall 
in the window (as I said before) but that I presently 
say: This party hath a great oppression of 
Stomach, no appetite to meate, with a great oppilation 
of the Liver and Spleene, is very hot, desireth 
much to drinke, hath a great paine in the 
head, and can take no rest, and was taken in the 
manner of an Ague (as they call it) with a grooving 
in the backe, and paine in the head, first cold 
and then hot, as I said in giving my judgement 
upon the last Urine, and indeed this description 
will serve for any acute disease, whether it be 
the Pleurisie, the small Pox or Maisels, a fit of 
the stone in the Kidneis, the Squinancy, Phrensie, 
Iliaca Passio, the Arthritis, or what other sharp 
disease soever, wherewith there is a Fever alwayes 
[/10./] 
complicate, or whether it be a simple Fever 
which is primarily the disease it selfe; but yet I 
will not alwayes use the same description to all 
commers, because divers messengers may come 
to a Physician, and may stay for companies sake 
to goe away together, and might fall to questioning 
with each other what the Doctour said unto 
them, and so might thinke (if I should use the 
same description unto them all) that I could say 
nothing else I therefore vary my description of 
the disease, and am sometimes shorter in the same, 
and then (if I find by expostulation with the messenger 
[^p.19^] 
that I have omitted any thing that I should 
have spoken of) I say that it proceeded from such 
a cause as I had already named, and that I should 
have come to speake of that anon; I am sometimes 
likewise larger in my description, as I am here in 
relating how the party is affected, for whom this 
Nurse comes: and she is as ready to take me up 
for the same, and sayes, that it is true indeed, that 
the party can take no rest, hath no appetite to 
meate, and was taken (as I said) in the manner of 
an Ague, but complaines not of her stomach at 
all, but cries out, My head, my head, and complaines 
altogether of want of rest; To whom I reply, 
that the paine in the head is the chiefe of the 
passions that the party is affected withall, but yet 
that it preceeded from the oppression of the stomach, 
and oppilation of the Liver and Spleene, 
which being obstructed, send a cholericke fume 
unto the braine, which inflame the Animall spirits, 
and cause this paine which hindred rest, and 
that (if rest were not caused) it would make the 
party rave, be franticke, and burst forth into 
senselesse, and idle talke. Thus having answered 
this objection, I now begin to touch the Urinall, 
to see if it have setled enough, but finding it not 
to have setled enough to my purpose, and to shew 
me those things that I must finde out of it, I set it 
downe againe very tenderly, saying, it must yet 
settle alittle better; and then I fall to questioning 
with the Nurse concerning something that may 
shew me the sexe, for I must find that out of the water 
[^p.20^] 
too; And now I aske her, what the party useth 
to doe in the time of health, and this is a question 
that may (she thinkes) as well be answered without 
giving me any light of the sexe, as the former 
question (which was, How long the party had 
beene sicke) of giving me any light of the disease; 
but you shall heare what I collect from thence. 
She answers, I demanding what the party useth 
to do, that the party useth to do little, save onely 
to goe up and downe the house, to worke about 
the home, to walke up and downe abroad, to 
keepe a shop, to labour, or the like; and from all 
these I have my severall collections. Now if she 
say, that the party useth to doe little, save onely 
to goe up and downe the house, I presume that it 
is the Mistresses of the house, or the good-wifes, 
or one of their daughters, or some Gentlewoman 
in the house, but for certaine, that it is a womans 
water, or a maides, for they should, and commonly 
doe (if their shooes be not made of running 
leather) keepe their house, and their worke 
is to walke up and down the house; but if she say, 
the party useth to doe such worke as is to be done 
in or about the house, it is most likely that it is a 
maid-servant, but if she say to walke abroad, I 
then presume that it is a mans woter, and that it 
may be the Master of the house, or his sonnes, or 
some other Gentlemans, whose worke and imployment 
is onely to walke abroad and take his 
pleasure; but if she say, to keepe a shop, I suppose 
it to be the Masters thereof, or an he Apprentice 
[^p.21^] 
his; or if she say, that the party useth to 
labour, I imagine it to be a man-servant, or some 
hired labouring mans; so by her answer to this 
question, namely, what the party useth to doe in 
the time of health, I discerne the sexe. And now 
I take the Urinall againe in my hand (for by this 
time it hath stood long enough to settle) and now 
I say that it is a womans water, suppose that her 
answer to my question (What the party used to 
doe in the time of health) did inferre as much, 
that she hath a burning Fever, is so dangerously 
sicke that she will hardly recover, unlesse such and 
such speedy meanes be used, and yet that All will 
scarce doe; and this danger I will alwayes pretend 
in every Violent disease, though there be no 
deadly signe at all; but not to the sicke parties 
(for that they cannot indure to heare of) but secretly 
to the messenger, or some neere friend, or 
by-stander, if I be present with them; and then if 
the party live, I shall not so much as have my 
judgement called in question, for saying the party 
would die, but be magnified for that I have recovered 
her of a dangerous disease; nay, to be sure 
to be happy in my predictions and prognosticks 
concerning the life and death of my Patients (for 
they must alwayes have a hint of that, although 
the thought of death be an unwelcome guest) I 
will deliver mine opinion both wayes; I will 
threaten, or rather pretend the danger of death to 
the sicke party (if my opinion be desired,) with a 
But if such and such meanes be used, you may 
[^p.22^] 
haply recover: and to some by-standor or hanger 
on, I will secretly whisper that there is no danger 
at all: or else I will promise life to the Patient, 
which is altogether wished, and threaten death 
to some other inquisitour: and thus was a learned 
Doctour in Physicke over-matched by a meaner 
Practicant in Physicke, at Ashford in Kent who 
used this policy in his prognosticks. I have for 
mine owne part and office, herein delivered my 
selfe well enough to this Nurse in my prognosticks 
concerning the event of the womans sicknesse, 
for whom she is come: I have told her how 
the woman is affected, what the disease is, and 
what will be the event; and the Nurse is reasonable 
well satisfied herewith, but yet I have omitted 
something, that she will be sure to tell me of, 
for since she hath undertaken the matter, she will 
not goe without her errand. So, now she asks me 
if I perceive nothing else by the water, and I 
imagine well enough what it is else that I should 
perceive by it, for when that question is propounded, 
it is to know whether the woman be 
with child or no: to whom I answer that there 
are many moe things to be perceived by the water 
(but not at all times) as whether a woman 
were with child or no, which is that you looke 
for; but it is not now to be seene in this water, 
because her body is all out of temper, and her 
water troubled and discoloured, but yet I thinke 
her to be, and well I may, if she her selfe thinke 
so; I further tell her, that I could have certainely 
[^p.23^] 
told, (but yet I lie,) if she had brought her water 
in the time of her health: and so she is satisfied for 
that matter, and confesseth that she is with child 
indeed. Having thus satisfied her in all these 
things, told her that it is a womans water, in what 
manner she was sicke, what was her disease, that 
it was likely that she was with child (which proves 
true) and that she would scarce recover (which is 
no great matter whether she doe or no) I now begin 
to close with her and aske her whose water it 
is; but she will not tell me, and I commend her 
for it, for she was forbid, and therefore hath vowed 
the contrary; and indeed she was sent onely to 
heare mine opinion of the water, the which, if she 
like, shall haply heare further from the party, but 
if not, she hath order to goe to another Pisse-Prophet, 
and so if she like not his opinion neither, 
from him to another, untill she come to him that 
hits the disease rightest (as she conceives) by the 
water, and he (I dare say, the most foole and 
knave of all the three) is the man that shall be 
made choise of to cure this woman; and this is 
thought great policy in making choice of an able 
Physician. It behooves me therefore to be my 
crafts master in this Art, for else you see here how 
I am like to be nosed of a Patient, and to have my 
skill call'd in question; for (if I cannot finde the 
disease by the water) they will soone conclude 
that I know not how to cure it. This Nurse tells 
me indeed (but if she had not told me, I should 
have perceived it) that she came to heare mine 
[^p.24^] 
opinion of the water, and that the sicke party 
would send to me againe, when she had heard (she 
should have said, If she liked it) what was mine 
opinion, and I thinke I have fitted her, and now 
tell the Nurse, that it had been fitter they had sent 
for some present remedies, than to know the disease, 
or to heare mine opinion of it, so I hast her 
away with her oracle, bid her be sure to deliver it 
so as I had told her, and tell (but not to the sicke 
party) to some of her neere friends, how dangerously 
she is sicke, and that I would (if she thinke 
good to make use of me) use the best meanes to 
recover her that Art could lead me unto; and now 
I bid her make all the hast that may be, but yet 
(before I let her goe) I thus bespeake her; in faith 
Nurse, I commend thee that thou wilt doe thy errand 
handsomely, and make a Physician finde the 
disease out of the water, and not be gull'd (to tell 
how the party was affected) as many a foole 
would have done, but I hope I have shewed thee 
truly how the party is affected, and what is her 
disease, and given thee such satisfaction as will 
content them that sent thee: loe therefore here is 
for thy paines, because thou hast put me to it so 
handsomely, and so I give her, (fearing lest I 
should have erred, that she may maintaine my credit, 
and in hope of receiving a better fee, for being 
sent for) the crackd groat, or the Harry groat 
that was sent in stead of sixe pence, for casting this 
water; nay, if it chance to be sixe pence indeed, 
she shall have it all, and so I shall be sure to have 
[^p.25^] 
my message well done, and perhaps she will tell 
me that which she denied before; but if not, she 
will magnifie me for my skill, and I shall be sure to 
heare further from the party, and have the casting 
of all the waters that she can bring me; so I now 
send her away and laugh at her, and the Devill at 
us both: I laugh at her because I have cozend her, 
and the Devill, that he hath cozend us both, by 
making her to believe that I discerne all those 
things by the water that I told her, and making 
me to back my pretended knowledge by such fallacies. 
But doe not now imagine that I have been 
so long in hand with this Nurse, in giving judgement 
of this Urine, as I have been in penning the 
circumstances with the severall actions and gestures 
that I use in the examination of a Pisse pot, 
which I have set downe to helpe thy understanding, 
[/11./] 
or so long as thou hast been in reading them; 
but that (as if she had been but now new come in) 
I take the Urinall of her, propound the first question, 
set downe the Urinall in the window, and 
pronounce a description of the disease: then propounding 
the other questions in order (as I have 
done before) I define or determine the disease, tell 
her that such and such meanes ought suddainly to 
be used, and so send her away; suppose therefore 
that she came but newly in, and is but now 
new gone out, and so I have done with her, and 
sent her away in a trice, and am ready for the 
next commer. But stay here a little, let that messenger 
tary, and conceive with me how one may 
[^p.26^] 
give his judgement of any sharpe disease by the 
water, (though it be not there to be seene,) in 
pronouncing my judgement upon this last Urine, 
for I cannot stand to instance upon many particulars: 
marke therefore the description that I gave 
to the Nurse of the last disease, which I determined 
to be a Fever, after that I perceived by the 
Nurses answer to my first question (which was, 
how long the party had been sicke) that it was a 
[/12./] 
sharpe disease; now my description was this; that 
the party had a great oppression of stomach and 
no appetite to meate; a great oppilation of the 
Liver and Spleene, was very hot, desired much 
to drinke, had a great paine in the head, and 
could take no rest, and was taken in the manner 
of an Ague with a paine in the head, and grooving 
in the backe, first cold and then hot, the 
which description may serve for any sharpe disease 
in giving judgement of a water; yet I doe not affirme, 
that in every sharpe disease the party is just 
thus affected in every respect, but for the most 
part, for if it chance to faile and be excepted 
against, I have shewed, how to make it good to 
the messenger, and to serve the turne to satisfie 
him, and not the Physician and practicant in Physicke. 
Marke further, that in describing the disease, 
and shewing how the party is affected, I 
doe not yet define, determine, or name the disease, 
till I have expostulated with the messenger 
so farre, that I perceive the disease from thence, 
and have founded enough out of him, to tell him 
[^p.27^] 
any thing that he shall desire to know of me; and 
then I determine the disease to be (as the symptomes, 
when I have strictly examined them, shall 
agree with the messengers relation.) A Fever, 
the small Pox, or Maisels, a Pleurisie, or the like, 
looking still upon the Urine, as if I found it there, 
whereas I hope you well perceive my fetches, 
which helpe me out, or else Dun might have 
stucke full fast in the mire. I hope also, that you 
perceive how easily a man may give his judgement 
of any other acute disease by the water, 
though it doe not shew it; and now a word or 
two with this other messenger, and then I shall 
have done with acute, sharpe, and violent diseases. 
 
[^p.28^] 
[}CHAP. IV. 
 
The rude simplicity of such as send their Urine unto 
a Physician without any instructions how 
the party is affected: And the desperate hazzard, 
that they put their lives in, who adventure 
to take Physicke prescribed only by the sight of the 
Urine.}] 
 
NOw this messenger is as rough-hewed as 
he that sent him, and is a very plain fellow 
in his holy-day Jacket and his busking 
Hose; he was call'd from making of Faggots, or 
from thrashing, to goe to the Doctour and carry 
this Pisse that is put up in the Vinegar bottle, and 
brought to me to judge of; and it is a very turbid 
water of a very high, darke, red colour, by which 
as also by the messenger, (for I can better tell, by 
the messenger, his gesture, time of comming, haste 
to be gone, and other circumstances, what the 
partie ayleth, how long he hath beene sicke, and 
whether it be a mans or womans water, than I or 
any Physician can doe by the Urine, especially if I 
lived in a Towne or Citie where I had much 
Country practice) I conceive it to be some Countrie 
Farmers, his sonnes, or mans, his Hubber de 
hoy which is his man-boy, or halfe a man and halfe 
a boy: But which of them soever it be, hee hath 
[^p.29^] 
borne it out with head and shoulders (for so your 
Country people use to doe before they send to a 
Doctour) and wrastled so long with the disease, 
and been so often foyled out, for they doe not observe 
the orders in Moore or Lincolns-Inne fields, 
where if a man be three times foyled out, it is to 
stand for a fall, and he is to wrastle no more for 
that time, as that he can no longer stand, and yet 
he is to have one bout more with the disease who 
hath a cruell second in this Duell, even death it 
selfe: And now (if nature be not assisted by Art) 
this fellow, whose second I must be, is like to be 
put to the worst, and the disease is like to give 
him a flat fall upon his backe in his Grave, never 
to rise againe untill the resurrection. Therefore 
if I have any skill, I must shew it now or never: I 
now therefore take the water to examine it, and 
thinke to question with this messenger (as with 
the former) How long the partie hath been sicke, 
whose water it was, and to put him such other 
questions as might shew me such other circumstances 
which might shew mee the disease, and 
guide me in the prescribing fit remedies for the 
same; but he cannot answer mee one question, 
not whose water it is, nor how long the party hath 
been sicke, no nor whether it be a mans or a womans 
water; much lesse the constitution of the 
body, the present strength of it at this time, or 
whether the partie be bound or loose in his body, 
with divers other such circumstances, all the 
which are so necessary for me to know, as that 
[^p.30^] 
without the knowledge thereof I cannot safely 
prescribe any Physicke, and yet this fellow cannot 
tell me one word, for he saith that he was not 
told, but was onely hired to bring me the water, 
and to bid me send something to help the partie, 
and hath brought eighteene pence or two shillings 
with him to pay for that which I shall prescribe 
or send; and all that he can say, is, that such 
a mans servant came to him to get him to come, 
but did not tell him whose water it was, nor how 
long the partie had beene sicke. And now what, 
on Gods Name, shall I doe in this case, for it is 
presumed that I know the disease by the water, 
and all other circumstances belonging to the 
same, which are requisite for to guide me in the 
prescribing of fit remedies, and I have pretended 
as much, and holpen to nurse up folkes in this 
folly, (as other Physicians have done before mee) 
by giving my judgement of diseases by the sight 
of the Urine, and backing my pretended knowledge 
by such fallacies as I have spoken of, without 
the which neither I nor any Physician in the 
world can give any judgement of a disease, nor 
come to the knowledge of such circumstances 
(unlesse the messenger, that brings it, tell us) as 
may guide us in the prescribing of safe medicines 
every way proper unto the disease. I must tell you 
therefore (for mine own part) that I have already, 
and doe for ever hereafter meane to steere a new 
course; yet I must, for this one time, prescribe 
for this fellow, who (being all this while out of 
[^p.31^] 
breath with his last Arthleticke combate, and having 
caught such a wrinch, (though he played 
strong play, as that he will goe neere to fall the 
next bout) is expected to enter the sands, to revive 
the quarrell, and to undertake the last encounter. 
I now therefore take the Urinall (since the messenger 
can tell me nothing) and looke better upon 
the water, as if I could tell miracles by it, for 
I must now make all the haste that may be to set 
him on foot, since he is so earnestly expected by 
his adversarie: Now looking upon the water, I 
[/13./] 
perceive it to be very crasse, thicke, and turbid, in 
all places alike, of an intense, high, darke, red 
colour; and from thence I conceive, that according 
to the fopperous Pisse-maximes, and rules 
of our great Pisse-prognosticatours, there is a 
great commixture of superabundant humours, 
which the substance of it (as they say) being 
crasse, thicke, and turbid, sheweth; and that nature 
is not yet able to concoct these humours, for 
then there would be some separation in the Urine, 
and it would not be in all places alike, but would 
have sediment in the bottome, and be transparent 
in the upper part; I conceive also that he hath a 
great Fever, for that the colour sheweth, being 
red and high, and that there is great danger, for 
it is of an high darke red colour, tending to blacknesse. 
But yet I cannot tell what manner of Fever 
it is, for I cannot discerne by the Urine (as common 
people suppose) the passions and affects of 
the sicke party, that determine the disease, and 
[^p.32^] 
should guide me in the prescribing fit remedies, 
and therefore I cannot tell whether it be best to 
let him blood, to give hive him a purging potion, 
or Clyster, or whether his body would now beare 
any of these, or whether I were best to give him 
something to make him sleepe, or some cooling 
Juleb, or some Cordiall Antidote to expell noxious 
humours from the vitall parts; now which of 
these methods I shall best use (for the messenger 
can tell me nothing) I know not, but however 
the matter is not great, for the party ventureth 
but his life, and why should not I adventure my 
skill against it? I now therefore pronounce the 
party to be sicke of a bastard Pleurisie (for it is no 
matter what I say to this messenger,) or a Fever, 
and that the party would hardly recover, further 
adding, that hee should have beene let blood a 
weeke agoe, and that I feared it would now be 
too late; but yet I wish it to be done, for if any 
thing in the world recover him, it must be that; 
and if that do it, it is but Hab, Nab, but yet however, 
I must put it in practice; so now I hast away 
the messenger to get a Chirurgion to let him 
blood; and tell him where, and in what quantity 
it must be done, and now it is a question whether 
the disease, or the life be let out by this blood-letting: 
if blood offending in quantity, or corrupt 
blood (offending in quality) putrified by choller 
in the lesser veines, be let out, the disease may 
chance to be let out with it, and so Mors or 
Death may tarry for a sacrifice, till some other 
[^p.33^] 
sicknesse take him upon more advantage. But if 
the good blood, seeming to be inflamed, be let 
out, when this Fever proceedeth from choller in 
the greater veins, or from Flegme, or other mixt 
humours in the stomach, Spleene, or Mesentery, 
which ought to be purged, the life (insteed of the 
disease) may be let out, by losse whereof the debt 
to God and Nature would be paid. But haply (insteed 
of blood-letting, I prescribe at randome, 
(for so I must doe in either) some purging Potion, 
and so set the disease and a medicine together 
by the eares, & leave the successe to fortune. 
And now whether the party live or die, I care not: 
for if he die, I have taught them to blame their 
owne negligence, in not sending any sooner; but 
if Nature be of such force, that she be able to 
withstand the conflict betweene the disease and 
the Antidote, and start up, and take part with 
the Medicine, so that the party recover, I shall 
have more attributed unto me, (as the onely 
cause of his recovery) than I have deserved, or 
than to God, who in his providence, had beene 
pleased (by the worke of Nature, more than by 
any skill of mine) to spare and recover him: and 
thus you use to over-value the meanes, whereby 
(as you suppose) you have beene recovered, although 
used so desperatly (as I have prescribed 
for this fellow) by a methodicall Physician, professing 
knowledge of diseases by the Urine, or 
used quite contrary to the rules of Art, by some 
rude Empiricke and Quack-salving knave, especially, 
[^p.34^] 
if you chance to recover; and to under-value 
the best meanes in the world, used by the most 
grave and learned Physician, if the party chance 
to die: never satisfying your selves, when things 
are so come to passe, that it was Gods providence, 
saying, (sic placuit Domino,) it was Gods will 
it should be so, and so resting your selves contented, 
but still tormenting your selves further, in 
thinking that this child, that friend, this brother, 
or that sister might have beene recovered, if the 
best meanes had beene used, as if God would not 
have directed thee unto that meanes, had it not 
beene his will now to take this party unto himselfe. 
And now, I hope that you perceive by these 
few instances, how a man may deceive the wisest 
messenger that you can send unto a Physician with 
a water, and shew you the disease by the same, 
although it be not there to be found, and how 
great danger they put their lives in, that adventure 
to take Physicke prescribed by the sight of 
the Urine only: and so I have done with all sharp 
and violent diseases, and am now comming to 
speake of Chronicall, lingring, and diseases of 
continuance, wherein I meane to shew you how 
to give judgement of them by the water, though 
in those diseases, if shew lesse than in sharpe and 
violent diseases. 
 
[^p.35^] 
[}CHAP. V. 
 
A Recapitulation of those things which have beene 
spoken, touching the giving of judgement of the 
Urine in Acute and Violent diseases: and a Prcapitulation 
of some things necessary to be premised 
touching Chronicall and diseases of continuance, 
before we come to the examination of the 
Pisse-messengers, as we have done in Sharpe and 
Violent diseases.}] 
 
AND now, whereas I shew'd you (before 
that I came to instance and shew my cunning 
in giving judgement upon Urines in 
violent diseases) that diseases are either sharpe 
and violent, (the which I have spoken of) or Chronicall 
and of continuance, such as I am now to 
speake of next; and that, in sharp diseases, the 
Urine is for the most part of an high red colour, 
and that there is a Fever alwayes joyned with 
every sharpe disease; so I shewed you that one 
may give a description how any sicke party is affected 
in any violent disease, by rekoning up the 
common Symptomes and companions of a Fever 
(which are oppression of stomach, want of appetite, 
Heate, Thirst, Paine in the head, want of 
sleepe, &c.) and make the messenger believe that 
I perceive the disease by the water, because I shew 
[^p.36^] 
how the party is in some kind affected, the which 
neither I, nor any Physician in the world can perceive 
in, or by water, but gather by consequence, 
when we once conceive that it is a violent disease; 
for then we know that there is a Fever joyned, and 
that there are some of those Symptomes (that I 
named) joyned with it, but yet I doe not know 
what kind of Fever it is, nor what violent disease 
it is (and therefore I doe not name or determine 
it) untill I have expostulated with the messenger, 
in such manner as I have already shew'd, and 
thereby come to the knowledge of some specificall 
note, or difference, which determine the 
same. 
 
I must now likewise give you to understand 
(before that I come to examine some few Urines, 
to shew you how I give my judgement of Chronicall 
diseases) that in Chronicall diseases (such as 
are the Dropsie, Gout, Palsey, Falling sicknesse, 
Scurvey, French Pox, Greene sicknesse, Malacie, 
which is the disease of women newly conceived 
with childe, Cough, Head-ach, Mother, and such 
like) the Urine is no way faulty, but representeth 
the Urine of healthfull; nay, oftentimes the most 
healthfull men in the world: And yet the Physician 
(such a Urine being brought unto him) must 
sentence the partie that made it, to be sicke, upon 
no other proofe but onely this lying strumpet, and 
false witnesse (the Urine) suborned by the beguiled 
and so selfe-conceited vulgar, and connived at 
by the Pisse-Justice or Judge, before whom shee 
[^p.37^] 
is brought, who is corrupted for a testar, sometimes 
for more and sometimes for lesse, and is 
contented to accept of her evidence for truth, 
when he knowes it to be a palpable lye that shee 
comes to affirme. She is indeed the dumbe messenger 
betweene the Doctour and his Patient, 
who (instead of passing the relation of his disease 
in writing, or by some discreet messenger) pisseth 
his minde in his water, and expecteth an answer; 
but if I should write him an answer in a letter 
written in the same language, I doubt he would 
scarce read it. How then shall I doe, who must 
answer his expectation, since the Urine in this 
case sheweth no disease at all? Or what oracle 
shall I give? Shall I say (such a water being 
brought unto me) I doe not perceive by this water 
that the partie that made it is sicke, or ayleth 
any thing: farre be it from me for thinking so: 
If I should returne such an honest plaine-dealing 
answer, both the messenger and he that sent him 
would perceive me to be diseased in my braine, 
without the casting of my water, and would presently 
say that I were troubled with the simples: 
For why (would they say) have I sent or brought 
this Urine if the partie be not sicke? Is not this a 
wise Doctour that cannot tell the Disease by the 
water? This Doctour shall give me no Physicke, 
for I have gone to such a Doctour (Rogue or 
Knave you might call him) that hath told me my 
disease directly by the water, and he shall be my 
Doctour; and (for me) so let him: And thus you 
[^p.38^] 
grumble at your Doctour, if he honestly tell you 
that the Urine doth not certainly shew any disease, 
and begin to examine whose water it is, and how 
the partie is affected, as also the age, sexe, constitution 
of body, the present strength of it, and such 
other circumstances as should shew him (he not 
seeing the partie) the disease, and guide him in 
the prescribing fit remedies, you presently suspect 
him of ignorance, and thinke that he should tell 
you these things by the Urine. And thus was I 
lately taxed by a Gossip at East Greensted in Sussex 
(where I lived and began my practice) because 
I was strict in examining the state of her bodie 
that I might not erre in prescribing her something 
to give her ease of that which shee complained 
of; for it was very suspitious that shee 
was with child, and she pretended that she desired 
to take something by my prescription, but because 
I asked her so many questions (the which shee 
thought I should have resolved my selfe by the 
water) she would none of mine advise, but reported 
that I had no skill in waters, and said, I asked 
her many questions, but could tell her nothing 
from the water. I spare to name her, yet I wish 
that she may chance to read this Story, wherein 
she may perceive that I could have cozen'd her, 
that she may blush to thinke that she was so much 
a foole, and thanke me that I have canonized her 
for a foole-Saint, by no other name, but the name 
of a Gossip; and so let her know that I wanted 
not wit to have deceived her, had not my will 
[^p.39^] 
beene restrained by a better resolution than to 
use such base deceipt (to fit the humours of my 
Patients) as is used to delude the vulgar, who 
think that there is no disease nor symptome thereof, 
belonging to the body of man or woman, but 
that it may be discerned in the Urine:
