A plaine Introduction wherby one may giue a 
true, and infallible iudgement, of the life or death of a 
sicke bodie, the originall cause of the griefe, how he is tormented 
and afflicted, what thinges are medicinable to the diseased 
person: and the day and houre in which he 
shall recouer, or surrender his 
vitall breath. 
 
Whereunto is annexed a treatise of the foure humors, and how they 
are ingendered and distributed in our humane bodies: with certaine 
and manifest signes to discerne of what complexion 
any man is: and the operation that eating, 
drinking rest and exercise, worketh in euery 
person: with certaine speciall preseruatiues

[^Extract 1, ff. A4r-G4r^] 
 
[^f.A4r^] 
[}Of the significator of the sicke body.}] 
 
IT hath beene an order and a custome (amongst the 
most excellentest and wisest Physitions) to choose 
the Moone for the principall significatrix of the sicke 
person, and according vnto her motion, scituation, 
and configuration (with other Plannets) haue giuen 
iudgment on the increasing, mittigation, and 
alteration of the disease. 
 
For Hippocrates (in principio Prognosticorum) speaketh of the 
Moone, and sayth in this manner. There is a certaine Starre of 
heauen which a Phisition must take heed and mark, the purueiance 
thereof is wonderfull and dreadfull. Also Galen (in commento 
de diebus criticis) saith: a Phisition must take heed & aduise himselfe 
of a certaine thing that fayleth not, neither deceiueth, (which the Astronomers 
of Ægipt taught) that is to say, when the body of the 
Moone is ioyned with fortunate starres, dreadful and fearfull sicknesse 
commeth to good end. Likewise Astronomers say, that among 
all the other plannets the Moone (in ruling) hath most power 
and maistry of mens bodies: for as Ptolomeus saith (in Libro de iudicijs 
Astrorum) vnder the Moon is contained, sicknes, losse, feare, 
harme, and domage: therfore about the alteration of mans body, 
the Moone worketh most principally: and not with out good cause, 
for as Astronomers affirme, she hath dominion and goernment of 
all liquid & moist substances, as the water, oyle, & sappe of trees, &c. 
As the thrice learned Clark Doctor Dee, in the 103. Aphorisme of 
his Booke intituled Libro de quibusda~ naturæ virtutibus saith thus 
Luna potentissima est humidarum rerum moderatrix, humidatisq~ excicatrix 
& effectrix. So we may no lesse assure our selues that she 
hath superiority and predomination on the foure humors, Choler, 
Blood, Fleame and Melancholy, which in substance are nought 
else but humedious and vaporatiue, although they differ in quality 
[^f.A4v^] 
Then as Physitions doe hold the opinion that all the infirmities 
which naturally happen to any person (and not by any mischance 
or sodaine accident) doth proceede and come by the distemperance 
of those foure Humors; so we may very well conclude, that if the superficies 
or head of a Fountaine, doth alter his accustomarie course 
of running, then the adiacienticall or belonging streames must 
needs differ either in quality or in quantity. So likewise the Moone 
being pasiua qualitatis collecteth and retaineth the good or euill influence 
of that plannet to whom she is adioyned or applyeth: as 
Hermes saith (in his Iatromethematikes) Luna vero stellæ (sine benisica 
siue malificafuerit) vtri se applicuerit, illi suffragabiter. And because 
her orbe is nearest vnto the earth, sendeth vs the vertue and 
impression of the other Plannets: and so causeth the mutabillitie 
and alteration of mens bodies, to good or euill, according to the nature 
of that Plannet with whome she is adioyned or configurated, 
and the part of the Zodiake wherein she is scituated: For the expert 
Physition must obserue and marke how she passeth through 
the 12. signes, and thereof shall vnderstand much of the alteration 
of the disease, by a certaine difference and distance of part of the 
Zodiake from the degree the Moone was in, at the instant when 
the sicke person was first bedride, or tooke his bed, and when the 
Moone commeth thereunto, that day they shall call critticall, iudiciall 
or mortall according to the space or distance it differeth from 
the degree of the Zodiake that the Moone possessed when the partie 
tooke his bed: which some men (deceiuing them-selues) haue 
reckoned and numbred alwaies by a certaine difference of dayes, 
from the time the party fell sicke, calling the second and fift, mortal 
dayes, the fourth, a iudiciall or shewing day, the 7. and 14. criticall 
ticall dayes or such like: which is an open and manifest error, for 
seeing the Moon (hauing an vnequall motion) commeth sometimes 
to the aforesaid parts of the Zodiake a day sooner and othertimes 
a day later: it is vnpossible (for he that accounteth by an euen number 
of dayes) to finde out the true Critticall, Mortall, or Iudiciall 
dayes. therefore for the better aboyding of this apparant error, I 
haue beer_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] annexed a very necessary Table, playnely expressing 
those aforesaid times, as followeth. 
 
[^Tables on folios B1r-D4v omitted.^] 
 
[^f.E1r^] 
[}The vse of this Table.}] 
 
FOr euerie signe and degree the Moone is in, there is 
16. columbes in the table (caractered with their proper 
figures of Algorisme, with these letters S. and D. 
signifying signes & degrees) in which the mortall, iudiciall 
and criticall daies, doth happen in: being noted 
at the head of the Table thus: Mort: Daies: Iudic: 
daies & Critic: daies. The vse of this Table is thus: The day and 
howre knowne in which the sicke person tooke his Bed; you must 
search the signe and degree the Moone is in (which being found) 
entring into the Table (in the vttermoste columbe on the left hand) 
intituled the partie falling sicke, (vnder the carracter of Luna) you 
shall finde against the signe and degree the Moone is in, all the Critical, 
Iudiciall, and Mortall daies in their proper Columbes (noted 
at the head of the Table) during the space of time, the Moone passeth 
through the whole Zodiack or signifier, to which aforesaid places, 
when she co~meth (during the continuance of y=e= sicknes) then shall be 
the true Criticall, Iudicial and Mortal daies, as you shall see them 
superscribed at the head of the Columbe. 
 
[}An example}] 
 
The first day of May 1605. A certaine man sickned and tooke his 
bed, at 6. of the clock in the afternoone, the Moone being then in the 
12. degr. of Pisces, now I desire to know the Critical, Iudiciall and 
Mortal daies (of that perso_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]) then entring into the Table in the vttermost 
columbe on the left hand, vnder the caracter of the moone 
in Pisces, ouer against the 12. deg. in the next columbe, I find the 7. 
degree of Aries, to which when the Moone commeth is a mortall 
day: in the third columbe, I finde the 27. degree of Aries, to which 
part of the Zodiacke when the Moone commeth, is a Iudiciall day 
In the fourth columbe, I finde the 22. degree of Taurus, which is a 
mortall time, and in the fift columbe, I finde the 12. of Gemini, to 
[^f.E1v^] 
which place when the Moone commeth, that is a Criticall day, & so 
of the rest vntill the Moone hath per amb_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ted through the whole 
Zodiack & if the diseases cease not in y=e= meane while, after you haue 
gone through the 16. Columbes, you must begin againe as you did 
before: Note that the time the person taketh his bed, is the first criticall 
time. 
 
[}Of the Aspects of the Moone with the Planets.}] 
 
IF you desire to know with what Planets the Moone is configurated 
or adioyned, you must learne what day and houre the sicke 
body first tooke his bed, or lay downe by meanes of the rage of the 
disease: except the sicknesse came to him at that time, when he was 
already in his bed for then you shall obserue the time in which the 
disease began to torment him: which being exactly knowne, you 
must calculate the motion of the Moone for the time the person fell 
sicke, considering that she is ioyned and applyeth vnto a Plannet, 
two manner of wayes, that is to say either corporally, or by the aspect 
of the Semidiameters of their bodyes called applycation. 
 
Corporall Coniunction is when the Moone is in the same signe 
and degree another Planet is, but the Moone is said to be radiationally 
ioyned to a Planet, when her body toucheth his Semidiameter. 
 
Likewise the Moone is aspected and beheld of a Plannet this 
manner of wayes. 
 
The one is called a perfect aspect when there is 60 degrees betweene 
the centure of the Moone and another Plannet, that is sayd 
to be a true Sextile aspect. 
 
Or when the body of the Moone is distant from another Plannet 
90. degrees, is called a pefect Quartile aspect. 
 
Or when the Moone is elonged iust 120 degrees from another 
Plannet, the Moone is said to beholde that Plannet, with [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
Trine aspect. And if the centure of the moone be distant [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
from y=e= body of another Plannet, y=t= is named a perfect oppos_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
 
The other is an vnperfect aspect called applycasion, as when a 
Plannet is certeine degrees different from a true aspect [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
in the Semidiameter of his body. 
 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
The Semidiameter 
or halfe the beames of 
	[^Symbols of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon omitted.^] 
	9.9 8.15.8.7.12 
		Degrees. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
[^f.E2r^] 
So that Saturne and Iupiter [^ORIG. BLURRED^] their forces but to 9. degrees 
Mars vnto 8. Sol vnto 15. Venus and Mercury almoste vnto 8. Luna 
vnto 12. for if the bodie of the Moone or her aspect commeth 
within the Semidiameter of any Plannet, shee taketh or receiueth 
the influence of that Plannet (good or euill) to whome she is so ioyned 
or applyeth. 
 
[}Example.}] 
 
Suppose the Moone be in the fourth degree of Aquarius, and 
Saturne, in the 11. degree of the said signe, then should the Moone 
apply to Saturne, for as much as her bodie is within the Semidiameter 
of his beames. Or if the moone were in the 10. degree of 
Taurus and Mars, in the 16. degree of Leo, then shee should behold 
Mars with a Quartile aspect. 
 
But if the Moone were in the 20. degree of Capricornus and Saturne 
in the 8. degree of Libra, then should the Moone be free from 
the Quartile of Saturne, for because his maliciousnesse extendeth no 
farther then the semidiameter of his beames (which is but 9. degr.) 
and their distance from a true aspect is 12. degr yet notwithstanding 
the ill fortunes doth afflict the sick person, when they adioyne 
of aspect the beames of the Moone, with their Semidiameter (but 
not intercidentically) for the farther the Moone is from their coniunction 
or aspect, the lesse they torment the diseased: and contrarily 
the fortunes (Iupiter and Venus) the nearer their bodies or Aspect 
approacheth to the moone, the more they intermeddle their vertues, 
and the sooner mittigateth the sicke mans paines. 
 
Note that of the Aspectes the Quartile and Opposition are hatefull 
and maleuolous Aspects, especially the Opposition. 
 
And the Sextile and Trine aspects are fauourable and friendly 
aspects, chiefly the Trine. 
 
The Conjunction is variable, for it is very good with good Planets, 
and extreame euill with ill. 
 
Also sometimes it shall be necessarie to know the latitude of the 
Planets. 
 
[}To know whether the sicke person shall liue or die.}] 
 
IF the moone (at the day and houre the sicke tooke first his bed,) 
bee free from the Coniunction, Quartile, or Opposition aspect of 
Saturne and Mars, this diseased person shal not depart by meanes of 
[^f.E2v^] 
that sicknesse (especiallye if Iupiter or Venus regarde the Moone 
with Coniunction, Sext_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]le or Trine aspects) for then the sicke sh_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ll 
soone recouer his health, and so much the rather if the Moone be 
free from combustion, and augmenting in light and motion. Also 
the head of the Dragon is of the nature of y~ fortunes (Iupiter & Venus) 
but not so effectuall in operation. 
 
But contrarywise, if the Moone be afflicted eyther by the Coniunction, 
Quartile or Opposition of y=e= ill fortunes (Saturne & Mars) 
the sicke shal die, chiefly if Iupiter or Venus doe not assist the moone, 
or if she be combust and decreasing in light and motion. 
 
Also the Dragons taile is of the nature of the ill fortunes, but of 
himselfe hath not the interficient force of Saturne or Mars, for as 
much as it is a line and not a Starre. 
 
Likewise if the moone be in the via combusta, which is from the 
middest of Libra vntill the middest of Scorpio, or vnder the Sunne 
beames and decreasing in light or motion, and applying to Saturne 
and Mars, eyther by coniunction or any aspect (chiefly by Quartile 
or Opposition aspect, although their semidiameters onely beholde 
the semibeames of the moone) it threatneth death. 
 
[}An Example.}] 
 
A certaine man fell sicke and tooke his bed, the mooone beeing 
three degrees in Scorpio (decreasing in light and motion) Mars 13. 
degrees in Libra, and Saturne 27. degrees in Sagitarius, and departeth 
when the moone came to the 13. degree of Capricornus. 
 
[}To know the times in which the sicke person shall feele ease of his 
paine, or recouer his health.}] 
 
HAuing found by the Doctrine aforesaid, that the sicke person 
shall not departe, then as often as the moone meeteth with [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
bodie or aspect of the fortunes, (Iupiter or Venus) during the [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
of the disease, at that instant the sicke person shall bee [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
eased of his dolorous paines: the ill fortunes the contrarie [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
first obuiating or meeting of Luna with Iupiter or Venus [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
a Criticall, Iudiciall, or Mortall day) the diseased person shall be_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
to recouer his health. 
 
[}An Example.}] 
 
Anno Dom. 1605. the 28. of May (about 7. _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]f the clocke [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
[^f.E3r^] 
the forenoone) a certaine friend of mine fell sicke in his Bed: th_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
Moone being then in the 2. degr of Pisces (decreasing) Mars 8. degrees 
in Gemini, Saturne 23. degrees in Sagitarius, Iupiter 26. in 
Capricornus, and Veuns 4. degrees in Gemini; Now for as much 
as I finde the Moone to be free from the interficient force of the ill 
fortunes, I iudge the sicke shall not depart: yet he was grieuously 
tormented and afflicted for because the hatefull beames of Mars his 
Quartile aspect, was within the semidiameter of the Moone, & none 
of the fortunes did intermeddle their fauorable beames. And when 
the Moone came to the 19. deg. of Pisces (meeting the Opposition 
of furious Mars) he had a great and mighty fitte of sicknesse, almost 
absolutely depriuing sence and motion. Also he was sorely tormented 
when the moone came to the 24. degree of Pisces, because she 
then beheld Saturne with a spitefull Quartile aspect, after that he began 
to amend, forasmuch as that was a mortall day, and Iupiter enuironed 
the Moone with a friendly Sextile aspect. 
 
[}To knowe when and what time the sicke Person shall depart 
and be grieuously tormented.}] 
 
NOW if you finde by the afliction of the Moone at the time the 
partie fell sicke, that he shall dye, then on the next mortall day 
that the Moone meeteth with eyther of the ill fortunes Saturne or 
Mars, by coniunctio~, Quartile, or Opposition (applying to the~ either 
corporally or radiationally) the sick shall dye at that day & houre in 
which she commeth to the interficient point of the Zodiake: which 
agreeth to the saying of Ptholomeus in the 16. Aphorisme of his Centiloquiums, 
wherin he saith we must behold the motion of y~ Moone 
as she passeth through the Criticall, Iudiciall, and Mortall daies, 
for if she be in them fortunate, it will fall out well: unfortunate, the 
contrarie. 
 
[}An example.}] 
 
The 17. day of May (Anno Dom. 1605.) A man fell sicke about a 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] of the clocke at night, the Moone being then in the 2. degree of 
Libra, Sol in the 6. degree of Gemini, Saturne in the 24. deg. of Sagitarius, 
Iupiter in the 27. degree of Capricornus, Mars in the 10. 
degree of Gemini and Venus in the 22. degree of Taurus: Now I 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] the Moone [^ORIG. BLURRED^] by the [^ORIG. BLURRED^] Quartile aspect of Saturne, 
[^f.E3v^] 
being scituated within the maleuolous beames of the semidiameter 
of feoward Saturne, wherby I iudge that the sicke shall depart: then 
entring into the Table of Criticall, Iudiciall and Mortall dayes, I 
finde the first mortall day to bee when the Moone commeth to the 
27. deg. of the said signe of Libra, yet for asmuch as that degree is 
free from the oppression of the ill fortunes. I affirme that the sicke 
shall dye at that time the Moone commeth to the said signe and 
degree: Therfore I seeke the next dying day, which is when the 
moone commeth to the 12. degree of Sagitarius, which being aflicted 
by the Opposition of Mars, collocated in the 14. degree of Gemini, 
I iudge he shall dye when the Moone commeth to the 12. degree of 
Sagitarius: and so he did. 
 
Note that during the time and permanence of the sicknesse, as 
often as the Moone meeteth the bodies or ill aspects of the distroyers 
of nature, so often the diseased person shal feele and sustaine 
very sore panges. 
 
Furthermore, some Astronomers affirme, that as long as the 
Moone decreaseth in motion, so long the griefe shal aggrauate, and 
waxe greater and greater. 
 
But Hyppocrates (in Libro de Iudicijs infirmitat: secundum lunam) 
saith thus, when the sick person taketh his bed you must consider 
whether the moone departeth out of combustion, for then the 
sicknesse shall increase vntil Luna commeth to Opposition, by reason 
that humors increase in mens bodies: and if shee be then with 
good Plannets, it falleth out well: with euill, the contrarie. 
 
[}Of the cause of the disease.}] 
 
TO knowe the cause of the disease, you must looke with what 
Plannet the moone is configurated or adioyned eyther by coniunction 
or aspect, and according to the nature and influence of that 
planet, iudge the disease that afflicted the moone. 
 
The coniunction of any aspect of the ill fortunes doth afflict the 
Moone and the Quartile, and Opposition of Sol and Mercury. 
Now if Sa_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e or Mercury oppresse the Moone, the disease shalbe 
slowe and slacke, with lassitude and heauinesse of the limbes: insomuch 
that the sicke shall scarce bee able to stirre his bodie, and the 
disease shall shew it selfe by little and little, by [^ORIG. BLURRED^] of the bodie 
[^f.E4r^] 
with defluction, debillitie, and obstruction: causing the sicke to awake 
out of his sleepe sodainly or by sta_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s. &c. 
 
The sicke person (also as Hermes saith) shall be sollitarie, silent, 
and fearefull, desiring heate, warme cloathes, and darknesse, with 
often sighing, and continual oscitation and yawning: the whole superficies 
of the body will be colde and dry, and the pulses little and 
slow. The cure of such, is by thinges that disolue and binde. 
 
But if the Moone (at that time the person fell sicke) bee afflicted 
by Mars or the Sunne, all the superficies and vpper parts of the body 
shall be in extreame heat as if they were incensed and kindled with 
fire. The party shall bee very prone and apt to anger, crying-out 
with scritches and fearce lookes, sometimes inordinately with rauing 
and franticke fits: as when choller rauisheth vp into the head, 
perturbating the braine with violent heat &c. 
 
Also they are very dry & thirsty, desiring colde drinke, with spitting 
and aridity & drines of the tongue, with losse of appetite, and 
desire of meate: continually saporing and tasting with the tongue: 
the visage and face as red as fire, and all the body loaden with superfluity; 
the pulses are little, pressed downe and inordinate. Bloodletting 
vntill the fift day, and such things as are refrigiratiue, repercussiue, 
and auoid superfluity, are medicinable to the sicke perso~. 
 
Likewise Hermes saith, that they in whose decumbiture the moon 
was afflicted of Sol or Mars, shall feele loathsomnesse in the mouth 
and stomacke, with paine in the heart, veines and artires. But continuall 
Feauers, Plurisies, Exulceration, and inflamation of the 
Lungs, take their originall of Saturne and Mercury, afflicting the 
Moone in fierie signes. 
 
The fortunes (Saturne and Venus) in my opinion do neuer vexe 
and torment the sicke body, although they beholde the Moone with 
hatefull aspects, or at the least wise, neuer in such sorts that they 
cause the sicke to take his bed: for seeing that they are adiutors and 
restorers of nature, it is vnlikely that they should become enemies 
& destroyers thereof, although sometimes by accidents (as by hatefull 
aspect) their friendship and familiaritie is restrained. 
[^f.E4v^] 
Of the effects that the Moone operateth and worketh in euerie signe 
when shee is afflicted by the ill fortunes. 
 
[}[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. in [^Symbol of Aries omitted.^]. of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
WHosoeuer taketh his bed, the moone being in the signe of 
Aries (chiefly decreasing in light and motion) and applying 
to Saturne or Mars (especially by Coniunction, Quartile or Opposition) 
the disease shall take his originall and beginning of a colde 
cause, with heauines of the head, and debillation and weakenesse of 
the eyes, with distillation and falling downe of humors into the 
breast, by meanes of a rumeticke head, & stuffing of the throate and 
pipes with fleame and catarre: The vehemency & rage of the griefe 
shall chiefly extend it selfe by night, all the intrailes and inward 
parts shall be exceeding hot, but the superficies and extreame partes 
shall shiuer with colde, with languishing and founding, and losse of 
appetite, and sweating in the dead of the night: the Pulses are weak 
and inordinate. Thinges that heate, mollifie, and lose the belly, doe 
represse the cause of the griefe, but bloud letting vnprofitable. 
 
And if the moone applie to none of the fortunes, but is within the 
Semediameter of the bodie of Saturne or Mars, or their ill aspectes, 
then on the next mortall day, in which the moone meeteth with Saturne 
or Mars, the sicke shall departe: but if the moone be not within 
the beames of Saturne and Mars, nor their malicious aspects (especially 
increasing in light and motion, and applying to Iupiter or 
Venus) then on the next time that Luna meeteth with Iupiter or 
Venus (vpon a criticall day, &c.) The sicknesse shall abate, or at 
least wise, turne out of one disease into another. But if Mars likewise 
o_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ateth the moone in manner aforesaid, then the griefe shall 
be mortal and inuincible, for when the moone doth come to his diameter, 
he shall die after the opinion of Hermes. 
 
[}[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] in [^Symbol of Aries omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicteted.}] 
 
BUT hee that lyeth downe, the Moone being in Aries and applying 
to Mars or Sol, the griefe shal take his originall from the 
head, with pricking and aking in the pellices of the braine; those persons 
shall be tormented with continuall Feauers, neither can they 
[^f.F1r^] 
take any rest or sleepe, except somtimes a little _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]umbring: Their 
mouth is hot with intollerable thirst, the tongue dry and troubled 
with heate, with callidity and drynesse of the brest, and inflamation 
of the Liuer, tending to a phrensy and alienation of minde. The 
pulses are sublated, high & inordinate: The helping and healing of 
those persons, is by letting of blood, and vsing of thinges that refrigerate 
and mittigate. 
 
But if the Moone (especially decreasing in light and motion) be either 
corporally or radionationally ioyned w~ Saturne or Mars, or their 
enuious aspects, then the sicke shall die: contrarily if the moone bee 
free from their semidiameters both corporally & raditionally) chieflie 
augmenting in light and motion) and applying to Iupiter or 
Venus, then the sicke men shall recouer his health as aforesaid. 
 
[}The [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] in [^Symbol of Taurus omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
IF the Moon (at the encreasing of the disease) runneth through the 
celestiall signe of Taurus, be afflicted by the diameter, Aspect, 
Quartile or Opposition of Saturne (chiefly slow in motion and decreasing) 
the sicknes shall proceed of much drinking, ebrosity or else 
repleation, with Feauers comming of obstruction, and ach of the 
precordiackes, and artires: with inflamation of the whole body, 
and exculceration of the lunges: the pulses are lofty, high and inordinate; 
Blood letting and such things as open and disolue, profiteth. 
 
And if the Moone bee ioyned to Saturne or Mars, or afflicted by 
their ill aspects (especially diminishing in light and motion) then 
when the Moone obuiateth or meeteth with Saturne or Mars (on a 
mortall day) the sicke person shall perrish. 
 
But if she be free from their bodies or ill aspects (chiefly augmenting 
in light and motion, and applying to the fortunes) then on the 
next criticall day &c. That the Moone concurreth with Iupiter or 
Venus, the sicke shall amend. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Taurus omitted.^], of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
But if the Moone be configurated to Mars either by Conjunction 
or aspect, the sicke shall take his bed by the meanes of a disease 
proceeding of blood, and be vexed with continuall Feauers and obstruction 
[^f.F1v^] 
of the whole body with inflamation of the necke and pole, 
ache of the bones, with inordinate watch, insomniation, and desire 
of drinke, and coole things. Blood letting and things that extenuat, 
mittigate and aswage, are good against the cause of the griefe. 
 
And if the violence of Mars be not resisted by y~ fauourable beames 
of the fortunes, but y~ the moon must needs suffer his malicious influence, 
then on the next meeting of her and the ill fortunes (vpon a 
dying day) the sicke shall depart. But if the moone be deliuered from 
the intercidentical force of Mars (chiefly increasing in light & motion, 
and adiuted by the amiable beames of Iupiter or Venus) then the 
disease shall flake after the next Iudiciall &c. concourse with the 
Moone and the fortunes. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Gemini omitted.^]. of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
THe Moone in Gemini afflicted by the maleuolous influence of 
Saturne (especially deminishing in light and motion) shall cause 
the disease to take his beginning and original, by reason of vigillation 
and much watch, or by lassitude and wearinesse of the bodie 
with trauelling or excesse of labour and violent exercise: The artics 
and sinewes shal (as though they were losed) scarce cleaue together, 
with much debillation and wearinesse of the bodye: the griefe shall 
soone shew it selfe (or as Hermes saith,) after three daies vntill the 
30. day, the disease shall increase with small Feauers, and consumption, 
and wasting of the whole bodie: Also the disease shall be 
moste tormentable by night with sweating & griefe of the spleane: 
the pulses are low and little. Oftentimes such persons shall haue a 
defluxion and falling downe of humors into the armes and legges. 
 
And if the Moone apply to Saturne (either by Coniunction, Quartile, 
or Opposition aspect) then on the next congresse of Luna, with 
the destroyers of nature (vpon an interficient day) the sicke person 
shall giue vp his Ghoast. 
 
But if the Moone be elonged aboue 9. degrees from the bodie or 
Ill aspect of Saturne, the the sicke shall not depart, especially if the 
moone be increasing in light and motion, and defended by the 
beames of the fortunes: yet the sicke shall bee feeble a long time by 
meanes of the congellation and toughnes of the matter dispersed 
through all the bodie. 
 
[^f.F2r^] 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Gemini omitted.^]. of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
Who so taketh his bed, the moone being in Gemini, and adioyned 
or enimically aspected and beheld of the furious and 
ireful Plannet Mars (especially decreasing in light & motion) that 
person shall be violentlie tormented with a mortall and deadly disease, 
proceeding of much ingurgitation of wine and strong drinke, 
and chollericke matter. The sicke person shall haue continuall and 
pernicious burning Feauers, with obstructions and stopping of the 
veines. The pulses shall be high, and inordinate. 
 
Blood letting is conuenient to the sicke bodies. And if the Moone 
be configurated to none of the fortunes, but applyeth also to Saturne 
(eyther by Coniunction, or hatefull aspect.) the sicke person shall not 
escape, but at the next mortall day that Luna commeth within the 
dangerous confines of frowing Saturne, the sicke shall yeelde himselfe 
a prisoner and captiue to pale death. 
 
Contrarily if the moone be free from the semidiameters of the ill 
fortunes (especially assisted with the fortunes, and augmenting in 
light and motion) then on y~ next meeting of the Moon with Iupiter 
or Venus (vpon a mortall day, &c.) the diseased body shall feele ease. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of cancer omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
SAturne afflicting the moone in Cancer (at the lying downe of any 
sicke and diseased Person) denoteth the griefe to come of much 
bathing in colde water, or of a conceite, or vehement colde, or by late 
drinking, or sitting long at studdy, or such like: The sicke person 
shall be vexed with the Cough, Catarre and horsenes, and distillation 
and falling downe of humors into the breast: with obstructions 
and oppilation of the Pipes, with Feauers, strict and inordinate: 
the pulses are lowe and little. 
 
And if the moone be decreasing in light and motion, and placically 
adioyned to Saturne, the sicke shall die (chiefly if none of the 
fortunes assist the moone with their fauourable beames.) 
 
But if the moone be elonged from the beames of Saturne (especially 
increasing in light and motion) and fortunately aspected of Iupiter 
or Venus, then on the next meeting of the moone with the fortunes 
vpon a Iudicall day &c.) nature shall preuaile against the euill 
humors. 
 
[^f.F2v^] 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Cancer omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
HE that is bedride or taketh his bed, the Moone being in the 
signe of Cancer, malefacted by the euill influence of Mars, shall 
haue a disease proceeding of blood or sweet fleame, with euersion 
and tourning of the ventricle. Things that refrigerate and coole 
expelles the griefe. 
 
And if none of the fortunes intermeddle their friendly beames y~ 
diseased party shall hardly escape, especially if the Moone be combust, 
or decreasing in light and motion. 
 
But if she be adiuted and holpen by the fortunes, then at the next 
abuiation of Luna with the restorers of nature of Iupiter or Venus 
(vpon any of the alteration dayes) the rage & fury of Mars shall be 
emulgated and abated. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Leo omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
IN whose decumbiture & lying downe the Moone possessed the celestiall 
signe of Leo (and therin afflicted of Saturne) the griefe shall 
proceed of blood: the sicke person shall be grieued about all y~ breast 
with heate and intension of the heart stringes, with augmenting 
Feauers: The pulses are troubled & out of course, with great heate 
and feruentnes both inwards and outwards. Things that heate & 
mittigate, are very good and commodious to the sicke body. 
 
And if Mars also oppresse the Moone, or if she be not succored vnder 
the winges of the fortunes, then (on the next mortall day, that 
the Moon meeteth with the venomous beames of the destroyers of 
nature) the sicke shall dye: chiefly if the Moone be combust, or deminishing 
in light and motion. 
 
But if Iupiter or Venus regard the Moone either corporally or 
raditionally, especially she being free from the Sunne beames, and 
augmenting in light and motion, for then nature shall get the victory 
of the rebellous humors, & on the next ambulation of the Moone 
with the fortunes (on a criticall day) the sicke shall amend. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Leo omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
THE Moone being in Leo (oppressed by Mars) the griefe shall 
proceed of superaboundance of blood, causing vnstable and vncertaine 
Feauers, with languishing, and sounding, and losse of 
appetite: heauinesse of the body, with drowsinesse and dead 
[^f.F3r^] 
sleepe vnexpugnable, with extenuation and consuming of the 
whole bodie: weakenesse, with diuers passions and affectes of the 
hart. Things that are refrigeratiue & abstringent are medicinable. 
 
And if the Moone applie to the fortunes (chiefly free from combussion, 
increasing in light, and swift in motion) the sicke shall not 
departe: yet the griefe shall bee dangerous by reason of the violent 
heating and adustion of the blood. 
 
But if the Moone be past the Opposition and ioyned to the euill 
beames of Mars diminishing in light and motion: then (vppon the 
next interficient day that the Moone meeteth with the bodies or ill 
aspects of Saturne or Mars) the diseased person will be forced to yeeld 
and surrender his spirit. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Virgo omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
IF the Moone be in Virgo afflicted by the Coniunction or aspect of 
Saturne (at the time the sicke tooke his bed) the griefe shall proceed 
of cruditie and indigestion in the stomacke, with ache of the bowels 
and intrailes, proceeding of tough and viscuous fleame, sometimes 
with head-ache and pricking vnder the ribbes, Feauers, strict and 
inordinate. Things which callifie, mollifie, and dissolue, are curable 
to the griefe. 
 
And if the fortunes aspect the Moone (especially she being increasing 
in light and motion, and free from the sunne beames) then the 
sicke person shal not depart: yet he wil be long sick, by the meanes of 
the crudde humors which will be long before they are fully ouercome. 
 
But if none of the fortunes beholde the moone, then there is no 
hope of life, but at the next meeting with the moone and the ill fortunes 
(on a Mortall day) nature shall bee vtterly endamaged and 
ouercome. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Virgo omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
THe moone in Virgo (afflicted by the malicious beames of outragious 
Mars) the sicknesse shall proceed of sharpe and fretting 
humours, with fluxe of the wombe, and exulceration of the bowels, 
with small and vnstable Feauers: The pulses are slowe and thick, 
with euersion of the ventricle, & the stomacke abhoringe loathing 
of meate. Things y~ represse the disease, are such as are obstructiue, 
and expell sharpe fretting humors. 
 
[^f.F3v^] 
And if the seueritie and cruelty of Mars be not emulgated and abated 
(either by the co~iunction, application, co~figuratio~ of Iupiter 
or Venus) the sicke shall not escape: chiefly the Moone being combust, 
and decreasing in light and motion. 
 
But if the Moone apply to none of the fortunes he shall dye (on 
the next mortall day) to the fortunes the contrary. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Libra omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
AT whose decumbiture the Moone was collocated in the signe 
of Libra (and oppressed by the body or aspect of Saturne.) The 
grief shal come of the ingurgitation or inordinate swilling of wine, 
and strong drinke, with nocturnall and nightly assault and conflict, 
paine and griefe of the head and breast, distillations, cough, & hoarsnes: 
The breast greeued of lassitude, the stomack disdaining meate, 
small Feauers comming by night with a double accesse. He shall be 
continually tormented and afflicted, with remission and slacknes of 
the pulses. Thinges that callifie and heate are very profitable. 
 
And if the Moone apply to none of the fortunes neither by Conjunction 
nor aspect, then the sicke shall dye: especially if the Moone 
be combust, or decreasing in light and motion. 
 
But if Mars also afflict the Moone, then the griefe shall not turne 
out of one disease into an other, but at the next congression with Saturne 
or Mars (on an intercidenticall day) the sicke person shall dy. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Libra omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
MARS oppressing the moone in the signe of Libra, will prouoke 
a disease proceeding of blood; whereof will growe intensed 
Feauers, with vigillation and waking, and inflamation of the 
whole body. The reamidy in curing of such persons, is by letting of 
blood, and the vsage of such as are dormitable. 
 
And if none of the fortunes regard the Moone (so afflicted) the 
diseased person will be constrayned to guie place to death. 
 
But if the mallice of Mars refrayned (by the influence of Iupiter 
or Venus) the sicke shall not depart: but at the next congresse of the 
Moone with Saturne or Mars (vpon a iudiciall day &c.) the diseased 
person shall be restored to his pristiue strength. 
 
[^f.F4r^] 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Scorbio omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
FUrthermore the Moone being in Scorpio of Saturne indamaged 
(by the euill influence of his poysoned corps) The disease shall 
happen by the meanes of exulceration, or of the euil called bubo in 
the secrete parts, viz. in anno aut pudenda &c. And if the Moone increase 
in light and motion, (especially adiuted by Iupiter or Venus) 
then the sicknesse shalbe ouercome. 
 
But if none of the fortunes beholde the Moone neither by Conjunction 
nor Aspect (chiefly deminishing in light and motion) then 
on the next mortall congression of Luna with the destroyers of 
nature dryrie death shall attainte the afflicted corpes of his silly 
captiue. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Scorpio omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
THE Moone in Scorpio at the lying downe of the sicke person 
(oppressed by Mars) the disease shall proceed of some feruent or 
hot impostumation or exulceration, the Pockes, Measels, and Hemerods, 
Pestilence, Illiacie, and such like. 
 
And if the Moone apply to no fortunate plannet, (but is corporally 
or raditionally adioyned to an ill plannet) then on the next 
meeting of Luna with the destroyers of nature (on a mortall day) 
the grieued person shall depart. 
 
But if the moone be swift in motion and departing out of combustion 
(fortunatly affected of Iupiter or Venus) the party shall be deliuered 
at the next mortall congression of the Moone & the fortunes. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Sagittarius omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
SAturne afflicting the Moone in Sagitarius (especially slow in motion 
and decreasing) will torment the sicke body with defluction, 
of thinne and sharpe biting humors, ach of the sinewes and artiers, 
refrigerations, with extream horror of a Feauer, corripienting, and 
afflicting the sicke with double accesse. The remedy of those is by 
thinges that mittigate, aswage and heate. 
 
And if none of y~ fortunes behold y=e= moone w~ their amiable beams, 
but is adioyned or applyeth to Saturne or Mars, (either by Co~junction 
or aspacte) then the sicke shall not escape: but at the next mortall 
[^f.F4v^] 
configuration of the Moone with the ill fortunes, the sicke shall depart. 
 
But being adiuted of y~ fortun_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s (especially increasing in light and 
motion) and free from combustion, the sicke shall recouer after the 
next applycation of Luna and the fortunes on a criticall day, &c. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Sagittarius omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
MOrtall and deadly diseases are bred and ingendered in their 
bodies, (at whose decumbiture the moone was oppressed by 
the influence of furious Mars,) taking originall and beginning, of 
much drinking and repleation: as vnstable Feauers, comming of 
Cholericke matter, solution and loosenes of the wombe: The pulses 
are remisse and languidious, and the healing of such must bee by 
thinges that are refrigeratiue and obstructiue: 
 
If the moone applie to Saturne eyther by Coniunction, Quartile, 
or Opposition, then the griefe shall be vncurable. 
 
But if the Moone belonged 10. degrees, or more from the hatefull 
beames of Saturne and Mars, or applying to Iupiter or Venus 
(especially aumenting in light and motion) the sicke shall bee diseased 
vntill the next Criticall &c. obuiation of the moone and the fortunes, 
and then he shall be deliuered. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Capricornus omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
THe moone in Capricornus (afflicted of Saturne and diminishing 
in light and motion) the griefe shall come of a colde cause, with 
thinne and subtil distillations heauines of the brest, and the lunges 
oppressed with difficultie of breathing, the cough shall greeuouslye 
torment him by night, with intensed Feauers: Thinges that mittig[^ORIG. BLURRED^]te 
and heate, are medicinable. 
 
And if the Moone be not succored by the congression, Coniunction 
or aspect of the fortunes, the sicknesse shall be long, yet notwithstanding 
mortall. 
 
But if the moone be seperated from the semidiameter of his body, 
or euill aspect (especially augmenting in light and motion) the~ on the 
next confamiliaritie of the moone (with Iupiter or Venus) nature 
shall preuaile against the crudde humors. 
 
[^f.G1r^] 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Capricornus omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
BUt if Mars afflict the moone in the signe of Capricorne it wil prouoke 
an infirmitie of vomitting, proceeding of cholloricke matter 
or euill digestion. This disease is dangerous and full of perill: 
continuall Feauers, and vnstable, losse of appetite, fluxe of the 
wombe, with exulceration & exasperation of the fingers, by meanes 
of sharpe choller inflamation of the breast: and it is painfull 
for the sicke person to stretch or sturre his sinnowes. 
 
The pulses are remisse and slacke. Things constringentiue, and 
obstructiue, are medicynable. 
 
And if the Moone be within the semidiameter of Mars, or meeteth 
also the beames of Saturne (at that instant) then the partie shall 
not escape, but at the next obuiation of the Moone and the ill fortunes 
(on an interficient day) the sicke shall dye. 
 
But if she be elonged from the diameter of the distroyers of nature, 
Iupiter or Venus also assisting the Moone, the sicke shall recouer. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Aquarius omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
VVHen Saturne oppresseth the Moone in Aquary (at the lying 
downe of any sicke person) the disease shall proceed of 
much watch, lassitude, wearinesse, or violent labour and exercise: 
The griefe shall infect him vnequally, with remission, and intension, 
vntill the moone come to her Opposition, and then he shall releeue 
(chiefly) if the fortunes intermedle their fauourable beames. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Aquarius omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
IF Mars afflict the Moone in Aquarius (at the lying downe of the 
sicke person) he shall grieued with a most acute and sharpe 
cause. 
 
And if the Moone apply to any of the fortunes (chiefly increasing 
in light and motion) the diseased person shall not depart. 
 
But if the moone be corporally or raditionally adioyned or aspected 
of the ill fortunes, then there will be smal hope of life. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Pisces omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] oppressed.}] 
 
THe Moone decreasing in light and motion, and afflicted of Saturne 
in Pisces, the disease shall happen of refrigerations & colde 
[^f.G1v^] 
bathings, with grieuous distillations, and continuall Feauers, 
scarcely augmenting vpon the sicke: often sighing and pricking of 
the breast, intention of the precordiace and heart-stringes. Things 
that heate and mittigate doth succor the sicke body. 
 
And if none of the fortunes regard the moone, but she is aspected 
and beheld by the basilicall lookes of furious Mars, or if the Moone 
obuiateth also with frowning Saturne, or is within his diameter, 
then there is no hope of life (chiefly if the moone be deminished in 
light and motion) for then at the next congression of y~ moone with 
the distroyers of nature (on a dying day) the sicke person shalbe forced 
to surrender his vitall breath. 
 
But if the moone apply to the fortunes either by Conjunction or 
aspect, the sicke shall releeue after the next mortall concourse of Luna 
with the fortunes, chiefly if she bee free from combustion, and 
augmenting in light and motion. 
 
[}The Moone in [^Symbol of Pisces omitted.^] of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] afflicted.}] 
 
FInally if the Moone be in Pisces afflicted of Mars, (either corporally, 
or radiationally) and increasing in light and motion (at 
the decumbiture of any person) then shall arise a griefe proceeding 
of much ingurgitation of wine or strong drinkes, and of plentitude 
and repleasion oppressing the sicke with nocturnall intensions, 
with head-ache doting and phrensie, with burning Feauers, 
vehement thirst, and desire of could drinke. The healing of such is 
first by opening of a vrine, and the vsage of those thinges that represse 
the cause. 
 
And if the Moone be not succored by the fortunes, but is in domaged 
also by lowring Saturne, then on the next interficient day 
that the Moone ru~neth with Saturne or Mars the sicke shall depart. 
 
But if Iupiter or Venus regard the Moone (with friendly aspect) 
then on the next criticall, iudiciall, or mortall day, that the Moone 
pertranceth with the bodies or amiable beames of the fortunes, 
the violence of the rebellious humors shall be vtterly extinguished. 
 
Note heere that the Moone apply to any of the distroyers of nature 
in what signe soeuer she be, either by coniunction, application, 
or any aspect: although it be only by the vniting and adioyning of 
their semidiameters, yet it will worke the like operation in diseased 
[^f.G2r^] 
person: but not so grieuously nor mortally, as the Coniunction, 
Quartile, or Opposition. For if the ill fortunes behold the 
Moone (with Sextile, or Trine aspects) the disease shall not be lethall: 
neither also in vnperfect applications, Quartile or Opposition: 
whereas she is elonged, and separated from their beams 
(especially if the moone be augmenting in light and motion) and 
aided by the beames of the fortunes. 
 
Also according to some mens opinions, it profiteth much the 
diseased person, if the fortunes or good starres are scituated in the 
Meridian or Horizon (at the decombiture or lying downe of the 
sicke body) and so contrarywise it hindreth the grieued person, if the 
ill fortunes occupy the said places.

[^f.G4r^] 
Thus much I haue thought conuenient to write of the iudgement 
on sicke folkes, when the day and houre of the lying downe, 
or the descombiture (of the diseased person) can by any meanes bee 
serutated or neerely knowne: but if the day and houre cannot bee 
shewed (in which the sicke tooke his bed) then you must contemplate 
the scituation and collocation of the Planets, by a Celestiall 
figure erected for that time in which the question was demaunded, 
or the disease first demonstrated or shewed: which manner of 
iudicials I will now omit (for breuities sake) vntill my next Addition: 
committing thee gentle Reader in the meane whiles to the 
documents of G. C. in his Addition to the worke of worthy Darius, 
intituled The Iudgement of the Starres: wherein he hath learnedly 
and copiously intreated thereof.
