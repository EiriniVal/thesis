of the clockes for the houres of the

clokes be egal alwaies of .lx. minutes 
but they of the planettes whan the 
daye and the nyghte bene egall, that 
the Sunne is in one of the Equinoctes 
they be egall but as sone as the 
dayes longeth or shorteth so doth the 
naturall houres, by this it is conuenyent 
alwaye for the daye to haue 
twelue temporal houres, & the night 
twelue temporall houres. And whan 
the dayes be long and the houres lo~g 
& the dayes short & the houres short, 
in lykewyse the nyght. And neuerthelesse 
an houre of the daye, & an houre 
of the nyght both together haue .xl. 
minutes, as for ii. houres artificials 
that the one leneth the other taketh. 
And than take we out planetes from 
the sonne rising, & not before vnto y=e= 
sonne going downe & than al y=e= remnaunt 
is nyght & about the moneth 
of Dece~ber, the dayes haue but eight 
houres artificialles of the Clocke, & 
they haue twelue temporals, than let 
[^f.C8r^] 
the eyght houres artyficyalles be deuyded 
in twelue egall partes, and it 
shall be twelue tymes .lx. mynutes, & 
euery parte shal be a temporal houre 
that shall be of a fourty mynutes and 
no mo. Thus in december the temporal 
houres of the day haue but fourty 
mynutes. But y=e= houres of the night 
haue .lxxx. mynutes. For that tyme 
the nyghtes haue but syxtene houres 
artyficialles, if they bene deuyded in 
twelue partes, befoure score minuts 
for euery te~poral houre of the nyght 
in December, haue foure score mynutes 
and .xl. For an houre of the day 
bene syx score mynutes in two temporal 
houres, as many in .xii. houres 
artyficialles, that ben eche of fourty 
mynutes In the moneth of Iune is 
the contrary. In March and in Septembre 
all houres bene egal as is the 
daies i~ other moneths by egal porcio~

deuyded by the .xii. Monethes in the

[}Marche hath the signe of the Ra~. 
And is indifferent for taking of purgacion

ARies is a sygne mouable hote, 
& drye Colorike nature of fyer, 
and hath lordship in ma~s head 
and the face, and the partyes lo~ging 
to the head, wha~ the Mone is in that 
sygne, beware of cutting in the head 
or in the face or in any vayne that lo~geth 
to the head. 
 
Also it is perillous in the begynnyng 
of Aries to take any head ache 
or any hurtyng in the head, for it wer 
token of lo~g during, or els of deathe 
but it is not so peryllous in the end 
of it, & this sygne is mouable Oriental, 
of masculine kynde than is good 
[^f.D1r^] 
to worke all thynges y=t= is wrought 
with fier and it is good to take vyages 
towardes the East, and is good 
to let bloud on the arme and to bath 
the, and to sowe sedes and to make 
matrimonyes, and to begyn al good 
workes that haue would sone ende, 
and is euyll to do thynges whiche 
thou woldest thou last long, for as 
muche as the Ram is a beast, that 
raungeth, and casteth vp again the 
meate that he eateth to fore. Therfor 
there than shoulde no medycyne nor 
passion be taken in warde whyle the 
mone is in that sygne, for all naturall 
medecynes and passyons receyued 
in that tyme, men shoulde caste 
them vp agayne, and so it falleth in 
al the sygnes, that ben raunging, as 
Aries, Taurus and Capricorne, and 
the last partie of Sagittary. In all 
these there should no passions be geuen 
for drede of castyng vp agayne, 
[^f.D1v^] 
For this sygneth eryseth out of the 
orient, & cause the tyme to be hoote 
and drye. The man that is borne vnder 
the sygne of Aaries, by kynde of 
complexion is Colorike, and shal be 
wytty and wysely and disceyuable, 
small of bones, yelowe of coloure & 
kynde of harte. The sunne entreth

THe mone beyng in Taurus 
that is the sygne of y=e= 
Bul, the which sygne reygneth 
in the necke & the 
throte, it is tha~ peryllous 
[^f.D2r^] 
to be ventused in the necke or catche 
sickenes in the throte & muche more 
peryllous in the begynnyng than in 
the ende, this sygne is stedfaste Meridional 
that is of the Southe partye, 
he is colde and drye earthly and of feminine 
kynde, and Melancoly of co~plexion, 
it is then good to sowe sedes 
to plante trees and vynes, for they 
shal redely grow & it is good to bylde 
housyng and to wed a wyfe, & euery 
thynge to do that thou wouldest haue 
longe to endure and stably to abyde. 
It is euill to begyn batayle or to 
fyght. For it causeth the tyme to be 
colde and dry, & the wynde to haue his 
course nygh the earth, and the skyes 
to fly abrode by the earth. 
 
The ma~ that is borne vnder this 
sygne, is by kinde of complexion Melancoly 
vnstable and vntrue whyte 
lyuered and scarse of his purse. The 
sunne entreth in y=e= sygne of Taurus

in the armes and the handes of 
a man This sygne is double bodied 
and occidentall, that is of the weste 
partie, and is sanguine of co~plexion 
hote and moyst after y=e= ayre. In that 
time beware of cottyng in the shoulders, 
armes, and ha~des, nor in that 
tyme vpon no vayne in those places. 
It is good that tyme to treate of 
[^f.D3r^] 
frendship, and whan the mone is in 
the sygne of Gemini, beware of lettyng 
of bloud for it is euill, and specially 
in the blumes, for Gemini gouerneth 
them and if one take the sickenes 
in a house and dye, all the other 
be in great daunger to dye of y=e= 
same. The man that is borne whyle 
the mone is vnder the lordshippe of 
this sygne, he shall by way of kynde 
be very wise priuy, and true, he shal 
haue .iii. wyues and he shal trauayle

and in the ende, this sygne

party. Also it is euyll to buylde housyng, 
or to set trees or to begyn any
