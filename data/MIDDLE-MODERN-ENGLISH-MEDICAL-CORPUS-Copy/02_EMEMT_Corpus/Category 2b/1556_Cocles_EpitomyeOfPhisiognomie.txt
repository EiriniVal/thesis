[}Of the sygnyfycacion of the 
voyce.}] 
 
[}The .xxii. Chapter.}] 
 
HEre Aristotle dothe Physiognomate by 
the voice, affirming a doble knowledge, 
after the doble diposition of the voyce: 
for sayeth he, the voyce maye be heauye 
and dyscensed, or hyghe, that is greate, 
to a basse orgayne pype: and suche a 
voyce (saieth he) declareth that manne 
to bee stronge: or yf it maye bee small and lowe 
[^f.C4v^] 
that is not greate, but softe, whiche declareth suche a 
parsone to be ferfull: And the causes of these sygnifycationes 
be taken by the complextion or qualitie 
of the harte, and lunges, in the hotnes and coldnes 
of them: For these membres when they be hote, cause 
or make large and sounding pippes, and much breth 
by the largenes of those synewes: Wherefore muche 
breathe, in suche large and great sounding pypes, 
make a great and grosse or base voyce, like to a large, 
and greate, or base or gane pype blowen, whiche 
soundeth verie bigge, and base_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ie, & econtrario. When 
these membres bee colde, they make those synewes or 
vayne pypes, small, and narrowe, and litle breathe, by 
the whiche is caused a highe and shryll voyce: as the 
lyke appereth in small organe pypes, whiche blowe~, 
make a shryll sounde: and the lyke knowledge of thys 
is in men, and litle women, the me~ for theyr hotnes, 
and women for theyr coldnes, and this wel appereth 
by Auerois, where he wryteth (de signis temperantie 
pulmonis) sayinge that the fortitude of the voyce 
dothe ensewe lyke the largenes of the vaines, and the 
largenes declareth the hotnes of the complexcion or 
qualitie of the lunges, and the causeis, that the fortytude 
of the voyce declareth necessarilye hotenes, but 
the colde complexion, declareth straytnes of the wayes, 
that is, of the vaynes, and debilitie of the voyce: 
The Phylosopher, in an other distinctyon sayth also, 
that they which speake greate, bee Iniurious, compared 
to the asse: And they which fore call, be foolish: 
in a basse maner, and ende smalle, bee iracundyo~us, 
and to be pleased, compared to the Oxe, and to the co~lines 
of the voyce. And they that speake small, safte, 
fayntlye or weryedlie, speake fearfullye, and compared 
[^f.C5r^] 
to women, and to the decentnes of the voyce: they 
whiche call in a bigge or basse voyce not parplexed, be 
compared to bandogges, and to the comlines therof. 
They that call saftlie, without anie tension or reaching 
out, be gentle, compared to the shepe: They which 
call small and feareilie, be Iracundious, compared to 
the gottes. These hetherto, bee after the minde & iudgement 
of Aristotle, and the same lyke affirmeth Albertus, 
and Conciliator, & Hieronimus de: Manfredis, 
a bononiane, but yet Cocles writeth of the same 
in a more ample maner, and with other wordes as after 
shal appeare, bringing in a co~trary reason to these 
afore. First Cocles sayeth, that he which hath a great, 
hyghe, and sounding voyce, declareth to be bolde, eloquente, 
and a warrioure. The voyce meane in subtilnes, 
and grosnes, declareth such a parsone to be sapiente, 
forseinge, true, and iuste: for the contrary cause, 
he which speaketh or talketh faste, especiallye hauyng 
a small or shryll voyce declareth suche a parsone to be 
obstinate or malaparte, a foole importunate, and a 
lyare. The voyce also greate, to be iracundious, and 
of an euyll nature. The voyce swete (or fawningly as 
I maye name it) is enuyous, & suspicious. The pleasantnes 
or bewtyfulnes of the voice, declareth folishnes, 
cockebraynes, and stoutnes. The swiftnes of 
talke, declareth a hote complextione, and the same 
affermeth, Albertus, Loxius, Palemon, Phylemon, 
and Conciliator, vnder those wordes. Ageyne the 
voyce greate, to bee iracundious, peruerce and of an 
euyll nature, and the reason is, for the vntemperate 
caliditie. He that speaketh hastely, haui~g a shril voice, 
declareth to be frowarde, obstinate, or malaparte, a 
foole, importunate, a lyar, irefull, and alway euil condicioned. 
[^f.C5v^] 
The voice asper, lyke the crane, to bee enuious, 
teteyning rancoure, and secrete hatred in the 
harte, and aboundinge in melancholike humores: He 
that speaketh hys wordes cuttedlye, not with a longe 
breathe: declareth a vilenes or infection of nature, 
through the coldnes of the harte, and perauenture 
wyth moystnes applicated. And he also whych hathe a 
heauy voyce, is seruaunt to his proper belly: the reason 
is, because the voyce heauye, procedeth of the debylitie 
of the vertue, which can not breathe oute plentifulnes 
of aire to moue the muscles of the breaste, by 
which proceadith slouggyshnes, so that the wit cannot 
be applyed in study, nor laboure with the body, or vse 
bodilie laboure. They that speake bigge inflexible, by 
the commotion of the breste: be manlye, vnapte to bee 
taught or to lerne, and hardy, compared to the lyons. 
They which haue a slowe and basse voice, be peasable, 
and ioyous or merie: and certaine of these parsones, 
be iuste and affable manered. And they which speake 
and sounde theyr wordes thorough the nosethrelles, 
be babblers, lyars, malycious, and enuious, and of 
them there be whyche ioye in euyll, and suche follow 
the nature of the Ducke, as Cocles by experience 
founde trewe. 
 
These fewe examples gentle reader, of the sygnyficacions 
of the voice, for thys tyme suffice here: which I 
shall desyre thee to accept in good parte, bearyng with 
my grossenes in the traunslation of them, suche as 
they bee: And in so dooynge, I haue my hartes desyre. 
 
[}Of the breath.}] 
 
[^f.C6r^] 
[}The .xiii. Chapter.}] 
 
MUche breathe and wynde, argueth aboundancye 
of spyrite, and the contrarye is after 
two maners: as the tone by smalnes or lacke 
of the lunges, and the other by the straytnes 
of the breast: and therfore a beaste muche breathyng, 
is of muche fortytude, and myghte, by reasone of the 
caliditie resoluyng the moysture, and especiallye the 
dewe moysture: ordinate breathe, betwene great and 
small, beyng a meane, declareth quietnes of the harte 
and to bee a man well to be pleased: and to breathe 
loude withoute cause, and to make huge and longe 
syghes, wytnesseth a moste melancholike qualytie to 
be; and when the breath is cut betwene, beynge ordinate, 
and at the laste with the straytnes or parplexity 
of the mynde commeth oute troubled with syghyng: 
declareth that parsone to bee encombred and detented 
with thought and vexacion of the mynde: and to 
some, to be immixte with euill, especiallie, yf the head 
quauer or shake muche withall. And loke, when with 
bewaylinge or syghing he bryngeth or casteth the eyes 
crokedly or wrythingly, he then soroweth for that 
cometh into mynde, searching or deuisi~g with himself 
the maner howe that he maye best handle and doo 
the same. He that breatheth with a certayne noyse 
in the delayinge or stoppinge of the nosethrelles, 
declareth crueltie, brutish furiousnes, and violence or 
hastines: which delaying also is referred to the passio~, 
in whiche the troubled spirite and thycke resteth: as 
though it were accidental caused by running or laboryng: 
& then they be violent or hasty and iracundious. 
[^f.C6v^] 
when the breth shal be short, and thycke, and by a much 
cutting of, stopped betwene, is Iudged fearefull and 
weake. And he whych with the syghing & countenance, 
is bereft wyth a certayne godlines, and inspyratione, 
such a parsone is named, to be taken and wrapped, in 
furious loue. Aristotle in his secretces to Alexander 
sayeth, that when thou shalt see a parsone muche 
and often beholde the, and when thou regardest hym, 
feareth, and of this blusheth or is ashamed, and especyally 
yf agaynste hys wyll he sygheth, and the teares 
appere standynge in hys eyes, thys parsone (sayeth 
he) loueth, and feareth thee. And if it bee contrarye, he 
shal be enuyous, & contempne the. The breath loude 
cut betwene, with the syghing lyke, declareth sorrow, 
and sadnes for thynges loste. Certayne of the worthye 
Physitians affirme, that the breathe passynge 
oute colde, by the mouthe and nosethrelles: declarethe 
deathe at hande, or shortelye after. The Phylosopher 
Ptholomie also sayeth, that he whiche wepeth 
for nothynge, or for lyghte cause, shal be alwaye 
poore, and neadye. 
 
[}Of laughter.}] 
 
[}The .xxiiii. chapter.}] 
 
[^f.C7r^] 
[^Omitted an image of two male faces.^] 
 
A Foole much, and often laugheth, and they also, 
which haue the mylte greate: & econuerso. 
The bellowes of the mouth that lightly laugheth, 
declareth that man to be simple, vayne, vnstable 
soone crediting, of a grosse wytte, and fedinge, wyllynge 
to sarue, but not secret. 
 
The bellowse, or hollowe of the cheke that seldom 
laugheth, and soone hath done, declareth that man to 
be stable, a niggarde, or sparer, warye or wittye, of a 
parfyt vnderstandinge, secret, faythful & gloryous. 
 
The hollowe of the cheke, hardly moued to laugh 
declareth that man to bee sapiente, much or very selfe 
wylled, warie, ingenious, patiente, a niggarde, studious 
of his arte, iracundious, and a surmyser. 
 
The hallowe of the cheke, or bellowse that lightlye 
laugheth, and in laughing often cougheth or gapeth 
or wryeth the heade, declareth that manne to be 
varyable or diuerse, enuious, soon creditinge, and co~uertible 
to good or euill. 
[^f.C7v^] 
The hollow of the cheke, or bellowse that wryeth 
in the laughing, with derision of an other: declareth 
that man to be arrogante, false or deceatfull, harde to 
be moued, Iracundious, a lyare, and sumwhat geuen 
to be an vtterer of secrettes, or a betrayer. 
 
He which sufficiently laugheth, is benign, beloued 
with all men, endamaged or greued lyghtlye, and passeth 
very lytle of, or for any: and he is of an apparant 
comlynes, compared to sanguine parsones, or to 
Iouiall. 
 
If they sufficiently laughe, it declareth iocunditie, 
and a good complextion in that manne, and they 
muche ioye in coeating, especially when the eyes loke 
chearefull and merely. But yet to much laughter (as 
Aristotle to Alexander wrytteth remoueth reuerencye, 
and causeth olde age: suerly with them, is no assured 
felowshyp to be had, because there is no stability, 
nor secretenes in them, worthie the trustinge to, although 
they be saruisable, after certayne. 
 
He which laugheth loude or with a certayne noise 
is inuerieundious, and Conciliator sayeth, that he 
which in laughing cougheth, or susteyneth difficultnes 
of breath, is iudged inuericundious, and a tirant: 
and this Cocles found most true in a certaine prince 
Whose bellouse of the mouth often smyleth or couertly 
laugheth: declareth an euil mind, and peruerse 
cogitacion, and a lyare, and suche vniuersally, be malicious, 
and dyssemblers: and there is no trust in the~, 
or to be geuen to them: especiallye when it is conioyned 
wyth the accydentes of the mynde: and yf theyr 
eye liddes folde to a cloude, they be sleares of menne, 
theues and robbers by the hyghe waye, or pirates, as 
[^f.C8r^] 
Cocles manye tymes noted it. To smyle or laughe 
couertlye to hymselfe, in speaking or talkinge, declareth 
foolyshnes in such a persone, as Cocles noted 
the same, in a certayne countriman of hys: and suche 
sayeth he abounde in the melancholicke qualitie. 
 
[}Of the chynne.}] 
 
[}The .xxv. chapter.}] 
 
[^Omitted an image of two male faces.^] 
 
THe chynne large and greate with much flesh, 
declareth that man to be peaseable, of a mean 
capacitie and grosse witte, faythful, secret, and 
lyghtly conuertible to good or euyll. 
 
[^f.C8v^] 
The chynne sharpe, and congruentlye full wyth 
fleshe, declareth that man to be of a good vnderstandynge, 
of a hyghe harte or arrogaunt, and suffycyent 
laudable of fedyng. 
 
The chynne as it were double, by a certayne vale 
or hollowe dentinge in, declareth that man to be peasable, 
of a grosse wytte, vayne, soone creaditing, congruently 
saruisable to one, and a very surmyser, and 
secrete of hys doynges. 
 
The chyn sharpe, and subtyll or thynne in fleshe: 
declareth that man to be bolde, a warryer or fyghter, 
Ireful, disdainful, fearful at tymes, weake, and somwhat 
content to sarue. 
 
The chynne recuruate, wyth a vale or hollowe, in 
the ioyninge or knyttyng of the Iawes, and in fleshe 
leane, as it were sharpe, declareth that man to be most 
wycked or vngracious, symple, bolde proude or hautie, 
a threatner, enuyous, warie in expenses, deceatefull, 
soone angrye, Iracundious, a betrayer or traytoure, 
a thefe, and a surmyser. 
 
Note that Physiognomie and Pawmestrye doe 
more declare by experience, then reasone, but yet (saieth 
Cocles) somwhat may be iudged in the pryncypaller 
membres whiche gyue or expresse the magnytude 
and smalnes of matter fro the begynnynge of 
generacion. 
 
The chinne longe declareth aboundauncie of matter: 
and by reason of the caliditie, it is ouer muche 
lengthened out: yea they be Iracundyous, aspere, & 
cruell, as Palemon, and Constantyne affyrme. 
 
The chynne small, and shorte, declareth that man 
to be full of naughtynes, and vices, and one whose 
[^f.D1r^] 
company is vtterlye to be eschewed, being a man most 
enuious and vncurtyous: and this manne Palemon 
applieth to the venemous serpent. The chin rounde, 
declareth that parsone to be effeminate, condicioned 
lyke the woman: as Pythagoras wryteth. And yf 
there be aboundauncie of flesh vndre the chynne, reachynge 
to the throte: declareth that man to bee moste 
luxurious, especiallye yf ether hole be founde in the 
the chekes. The chynne verye longe descendynge: 
declareth that manne to bee full of wyles and deceates. 
And if in the myddle deuision of the chynne 
it be not much depe flat, it is a toke~ of venereousnes, 
and that with me~ suche shal winne grace and fauour: 
as Cocles manye tymes noted the same in theym 
whiche haunted harlottes. The chynne curuate, that 
the syrpes be as it were in a valye, declareth rudenes 
of wyt, and to be moste wycked manered or condicioned, 
vnfaythfull: and of thes there be, whiche be 
theues, (as certayne saye) vnles olde age cause thys, 
for the losse of teathe, Aristotle also sayeth, that they 
become lesse balde then other, which haue the chynne 
deuided as it were in two partes. 
 
[}Of the nature of the bearde.}] 
 
[}The .xxvi. chapter.}] 
 
[^f.D1v^] 
[^Omitted an image of two bearded faces.^] 
 
THe bearde in the masculyne, groweth after 
fourten yeares, by little and litle, fro 
daye to daye, and then after spryng the 
thyghes fast: and note, that suche heare 
spryngeth of the superfluitie of meates 
proceding thorow the fumosities: which 
superascende vnto the partes of the chekes or Iawes 
as a fume passing oute of the holes or chinkes of an 
ouen, or fornace, vntyl the wayes or passages be stopped, 
that they may no more ascende, and so lyke issewe 
oute the heares in man, whiche make the bearde: 
The coloure of the bearde somtyme, expresseth the 
qualities, and quantities of the humours, but yet Cocles 
neuer saw a bearde in coloure lyke to Iuorye, 
because the phlegmaticke humour is not mightye to 
generate heares in coloure lyke, for the lacke of caliditie, 
eleuatyng the matter congruente to the generacion 
of heares. 
 
[^f.D2r^] 
Some maye argue, and say, that we see somtyme wome~ 
haue beardes or bearded, & yet they be of a phlegmaticke 
complexcion: Thys hapneth sayth Cocles 
because the humors be so subtill, that by nature they 
be hote, that of them also spryng heares somtyme on 
the cheakes or Iawes, and properly about the mouth 
where the more heate aboundeth: and thys woman 
is named bearded, vnderstande that suche a woman 
is very luxuriouse, thorow her hote and moist co~plexcion, 
and that she is of a strong nature, and virill or 
manly condicioned: but the woman sufficiently naked 
and bare of heare, especially about the mouth: (after 
phisiognomie) is named to be of a good complexcyon, 
that is fearfull, chaste, shamefast, weake, gentil, and obedient 
for the more parte: but the bearded women be 
contrary, as aboue appeareth: here riseth a doute, why 
wome~ haue no beardes as wel as men. To thys dout 
maye be aunswered, when it is demaunded, why men 
haue beardes and not wemen, that thys cause may be 
by the especiall workyng and by the materiall and finall 
cause, because it is as an ornamente to the man. 
Note that in euery kynd, the male is bewtifuller than 
the female, and the beardt is also as a defensione to 
the Iawes, the which the woman nedeth not so much 
as the man, because the sences and fealyng is stronger 
or mightier in me~, wherby they maye the better endure 
to goe bare headed, and barefoted in the sharpe winter 
withoute harme to them, whiche very fewe wemen can 
doe & vnderstand also, y=t= al wemen in a maner haue no 
beardes: & why because al the humours in which ma~s 
bearde is engre~dred, in wome~ runneth to the me~sture 
[^f. D2v^] 
the whiche is in them, by a certayne passage, and runnynge, 
after the age, or increase and decrease of the 
Mone: as sumtyme once and twyse in the moneth: 
whose issue out is named to be the fluxe, or superfluous 
fume, but thys runneth, when the woman is not 
wyth chylde, and in them that be past .xii. yeares olde: 
and this menstrue somtyme in women is altered and 
chaunged to mylke in the breastes or pappes. By the 
aforesayde appeareth, that the thycknes of the beard, 
and muche hearines vniuersallye, is iudged of the 
substaunciall heate, and moysture, and of the naturall 
vygorie or strengthe. Here it maye be sayed, that me~ 
chyldren be hote, and moyste, and yet be not bearded: 
and the reaso~ is because the fumositie & superfluitie, 
which is the matter of the heares of the head and elles 
wheare, runneth to the nurishinge and increasinge of 
them as all these very well appere by Constantine. 
Wherfore how much the more heate, and so much the 
more aboundauncie of heare on the head: therfore be-ware 
of them which haue to much heare on the head, 
especially when he is of an aduste complextion. Be-ware 
of them espetially, whiche haue a redde bearde, 
because they represent the aboundauncie of adustion 
and caliditie, and such be luxurious, deceauers, and 
lyars, and in whome the principall heape of vices 
reste. Whose bearde is comlye, and well fashioned: 
declareth that manne to be of a good nature, and of a 
reasonable condicion, and congruente to all thynges, 
and manered after his bringing vp: but in the contrary 
maner it is of them, whiche haue the bearde yll fashioned, 
as appereth in gealded parsones, whiche after 
they haue loste bothe theyr testycles, be very much 
chaunged fro the nature of menne, into the nature of 
[^f.D3r^] 
women, as Arystotle sayth. Undrestande, that Cocles 
sawe manye whych wearing longe beardes, came to a 
melancholicke madnes, or folyshnes. And Cocles 
sawe also, manye parsones with him, that after the 
ful growth of theyr longe beardes, wer throwe~ headlonge 
into myseries, and kepte vnder: and also prynces 
hauing the lyke beardes, dryuen out of theyr domynyons: 
and of the bearde whiche cometh soone horie, 
he pronounceth the lyke, because theyr nature 
draweth nere to the feminine.
