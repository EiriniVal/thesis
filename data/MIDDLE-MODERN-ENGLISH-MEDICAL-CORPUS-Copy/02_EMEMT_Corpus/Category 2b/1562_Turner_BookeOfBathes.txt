[}Of the bathe of Baeth in Englande.}] 
 
ALthough there be a very excellent and holsome bath wythin the 
Realm of Englande yet for all that/ I reken that there are manye 
in the North and Northwest partes of Englande and some 
in the Easte partes/ whyche beynge diseased wyth sore diseases 
woulde gladlye come to the bath of Baeth: if they knewe that there were 
anye there/ whereby they mighte be holpen/ and yet knowe not whether 
there be anye in the Realme or no. Wherefore seynge that I intende to write 
of the vertues and properties of diuerse bathes that are in far countrees/ 
I thynke that it were mete before I wryte of anye Foren bath/ for sparing 
of greate laboure and sauinge of much money, to shewe fyrste the vertues 
of oure oune bathes. For if they be able to helpe mennis diseases: what shall 
men nede to go into farre countrees to seke that remedy there/ whyche they 
maye haue at home? 
 
The bath of England is in the West countre in Summersetshire in a city 
called in Latin Bathonia and Baeth in Englishe of the bathes/ y=t= are in 
it. This citie of Baeth is xv. miles from Welles/ and xv. miles fro~ the noble 
citye of Bristow. The chefe matter whereof these bathes in this citye haue 
theyr chefe vertue and streingth/ after my iudgement is brimstone. And of 
my iudgemente are diuerse other/ whyche haue examined them as I haue 
done When as I was at these bathes wyth a certayn man diseased in the 
goute/ I went in to them my selfe wyth my patiente/ and broughte furth of 
the place nexte vnto the spring/ and out of the bottom/ slyme/ mudde/ bones 
and stones/ whyche alltogether smelled euidentlye of brimstone. If that a 
man maye iudge the mater of the effect/ maye gather that brimstone is the 
only mater in these bathes/ or ellis the chefe that beareth ruel in them. For 
they drye vp wounderfullye/ and heale the goute excellentlye/ and that in a 
shorte tyme/ as wyth diuerse other one myles somtyme/ one of my Lorde of 
Summersettes players can beare witnes: whyche thynges are no lyghte 
tokens/ that brimstone beareth the chefe rule/ seynge that nether by smellinge 
nor tastinge a man can fele no other mater or miner to reigne there. 
If there be anye thynge lightly menged wyth the brimstone/ whych thinge 
I coulde not perceyue/ it muste be copper. For whylse I walked aboute the 
mountaynes/ out of the whyche the bathes do springe/ I founde here and 
there litle peces of marquesites and stones/ menged wyth copper/ but I 
could by no sense or wit perceyue/ that the bathes had anye notable qualite 
thereof. Then seynge that there can not be found any other miner or mater 
to be the chefe ruler in these bathes then brimstone/ we maye gather that 
these oure bathes are good for all those diseases/ whych all learned Phisicianes 
wryte/ that all other bathes/ whose chefe ruler is brimstone/ are good 
for. 
 
Aetius writing of naturall bathes/ wherein brimstone is ether the only 
miner or mater of them/ or chefe mater therof/ sayeth thus as foloweth herafter. 
The bathes of brimstone soften the synewes/ swage the payn that 
a man hath in desyringe to goo ofte vnto the stoole/ and when he commeth 
thether/ he can ether do litle or nothynge. They scoure and clenge the skinn. 
Wherefore they are good for the whyte morphewe and black/ for the lepre/ 
[^f.1v^] 
and for all scabbes and scurfes for olde sores and botches for the fallinge of 
humores into the ioyntes for an hardened milt or the cake in the lefte syde/ 
for an hardened liuer/ for an hardened mother for all kindes of palseis/ for 
the sciatica/ and for all kindes of itche or inkinge. But the bathes of brimstone/ 
hurte the stomack and mar it. Thus far writeth Aetius. 
 
Agricola in his bokes of those thinges whyche flowe oute of the earth/ 
writeth thus of bathes of brimstone. The bathes of brimstone soften the synewes/ 
and do heate. They are good therefore for palseyes/ for places ether 
pulled in to muche or stretched to farr furth. For the shaking and trimbling 
of auye membre/ and they swage ache. They drawe oute swellinges of the 
lymmes/ and dryue and scatter them awaye. They are good therefore for 
the goute in the handes/ for the goute in the fete/ and for the sciatica/ and all 
other diseases of the ioyntes. They swage also the payne of the liuer and 
milte/ and driue awaye the swelling of them both. They scoure awaye frekels/ 
and heale morfewes and scabbes. But they vndo and ouerthrowe the 
stomack. Then seyng as I sayd before oure bathes of Baeth haue their vertue 
of brimstone/ they that are diseased in any of the aboue named diseases/ 
may go thether/ and by the help of almighty God be healed there. 
 
When these bathes haue ben of long tyme knowen/ euen aboue a thousand 
yeares/ ether the vnlearnednes or the enuiousnes of the Physiciones/ 
which haue ben in times past/ is greatly to be rebuked/ because ether for lak 
of learning knew not the vertues of these bathes/ or els for enuiusnes wold 
not send the sik folk/ whom they could no otherwyse hele vnto these bathes. 
For as all men can tell verye fewe in times paste haue bene by the aduise of 
Physiciones sent vnto these bathes. But nowe in this our lightye and learned 
tyme/ after that so many learned Physiciones haue so greatly commended 
these bathes/ I doute whether the negardishe illiberalite/ or the vnnaturall 
vnkindnes of the riche menne of Englande is more to be dispraysed/ 
which receiuing so many good turnes of almightye God/ nowe after y=t= they 
know that the bathes are so profitable/ will not bestowe one half penny for 
Gods sake vpon the bettering and amending of them/ that the pore sik & diseased 
people y=t= resorte thyther/ might be better & soner holpen when as they 
are there. There is money inough spe~t vpo~ cockfightinges/ tenesplayes/ parkes/ 
bankettinges/ pageantes & playes seruing only for a shorte tyme y=t= pleasure 
oft tymes/ but of priuat persones/ which haue no nede of them. But I 
haue not hearde tell that anye riche man hath spente vpon these noble bathes/ 
beynge so profitable for the hole comon welth of Englande/ one grote 
these twintye yeares. 
 
He that had ben in Italye and Germany/ and had sene howe costly 
and wellfauoredly the bathes are trimmed and appoynted there in diuers and 
sundrye places/ woulde be ashamed that anye straunger/ whyche had sene 
the bathes in foren landes/ shoulde looke vpon oure bathes. For he woulde 
thynke that the straunger would accuse vs English men of thre thinges/ of 
grosnes/ & brutish ignorance/ because we can not trim our bathes no better 
of vnkindnes/ because we do so lightly regard so hygh & excellente giftes of 
allmighty God/ of bestly filthines/ because we make no partition betwen y=e= 
men and the weomen/ whilse they are in bathing/ but suffer them contrary 
[^f.2r^] 
both vnto the law of God and man to go together lyke vnreasonable beastes 
to the destruction of both body and soul of very manye. 
 
If there be anye liberall Duke/ Earle Lord knight/ Squyer or other 
gentle or no gentle honest man y=t= wil bestow any cost vpon y=e= bettering & ame~ding 
of these bathes I wil for my part because I haue no store of other 
riches help y=e= matter as far forward as I can w=t= my counsell which is thys. 
 
First & before all other thynges my counsell is/ y=t= euery bath haue an hole 
in the bottome/ by the whych the stophole taken out y=e= bath should be cle~ged 
and scoured euery xxiiij. houres at y=e= lest ones/ & y=t= I would aduise to be done 
at viij. of y=e= clock at after noune/ y=t= agaynst y=e= morning it might be full of fresh 
and holsome water agaynste the tyme that the sieke folke come to it in the 
morninge. And so should they be a great deale soner healed of theyr old diseases/ 
and in lesse ieperdy in takinge of newe/ whych maye easely come vnto 
a man/ if he go into a bathe wherein a sieke man/ namelye if he be sieke in a 
smitting or infectiue disease/ hath continewed. 
 
But if that by the vnfitnes of the place this can not be conuenientlye 
brought to passe: I would that no man should be suffered to bath hym selfe 
in the fyrst bathe/ wher as the water doth fyrst spring (allthough it be more 
vertuous then all y=e= other/ for the further of y=t= y=e= bathing place is from y=e= place 
where the water gussheth out/ the lesse vertue it hath) but in other whyche 
are deriued & drawen out of the principal bath. For I thynke it were necessary/ 
that there shoulde be drawen out by prety canales or condites a good 
nombre of bathes or cisternes/ whych I would should be euerye one seuerallye 
deuided from an other. But in any wyse I counsell that these seconde 
bathes brought oute from the principall/ haue suche an hole as I spake of 
before/ that ones in xxiiij. houres at the leaste the foule water maye be let 
oute/ and freshe maye come into them agaynste the mornynge/ when the 
syke folke shall go into them. 
 
It were also mete that euery bathe had a coueringe aboue it/ or at the lest 
it should be so bylded/ that in the tyme of foul wether it mighte be couered. 
Notwithstanding I would that such places would be open/ y=t= the vapores 
myght go oute/ leste they that haue euel heades/ be hurte with the vapores 
whych are to muche holden in. I thynke also that it were necessarye/ that 
certayn loftes shoulde be bylded ryght ouer som parteof y=e= fyrst or principall 
bath/ that honest weomen & other which would not gladly be sene in y=e= bathes/ 
might euer haue as oft as they nede freshe water drawen vnto them 
thorow an hole/ where wyth they maye bathe the~ selues in vesselles of wod 
made for that purpose prouided wyth all forsyghte/ that not one drop of the 
water/ whych they in the loftes haue occupyed/ fall not in agayn to the principall 
bathe/ but be conueyed out by som other conuenient waye. 
 
For the bringing of this mater surely to passe/ it were beste that y=e= loftes 
should be so bylded/ that only a bucket mighte go doune into the bathe/ the 
reste of them beynge quyte wythoute the compasse of the bathe/ sauinge 
that litle portion/ whereby water maye be drawen vp thorowe/ to serue 
them that are in them. And suche one place myght be deuised to drawe water 
vp thorow that it might serue for half a dosen cha~bres aboue or mo. This 
were also necessary y=t= in one of the bathes shoulde be bylded ouer the hotest 
[^f.2v^] 
place that there is a litle house after the maner of a scafholde very nere vnto 
the water/ after such maner that the hote vapores myght strike hote vpo~ 
certayn places of mannis body. For thys maner of receyuing of the hote vapores 
is muche better for som kindes of dropsees and goutes/ then the water 
it selfe is. Therfore this thing ought not to be forgotten. This were also 
necessary/ that not only certayn seuerall bathing places should be appoynted 
for weomen alone but also that other should be appoynted for such persones 
seuerally/ as are sike in smitting infectuous or horrible diseases. 
 
Furthermore because almighty God hath shapen & made herbes/ stones/ 
gu~mes/ metalles & medicines of diuerse other thinges/ principally for ma~ 
it is to be thought y=t= his will is y=t= y=e= same should som tyme serue such creatures 
of his/ as man can not wel want. Wherfore as it is wel done y=t= herbes & medicines 
made of diuerse other thinges/ should be geuen vnto y=e= beastes y=t= serue 
vs/ so I thinke y=t= it were not amisse/ if y=t= we made y=e= bathes after they haue 
serued man/ for whom they were principally made/ serue also to help horses. 
For performing wherof I would wishe y=t= one or ij. hathes in som conuenient 
place might be drawen out from one or two of the hotest bathes/ and 
the~ wold I haue so deuised/ that the horses that haue diseases in the legges 
and ioyntes/ might stand in the bath almoste vnto the belly/ and that other 
that haue other diseases/ mighte stand hygher in the water/ whych thynge 
maye easelye be brought to passe/ it that two holes be made wyth stopholes/ 
the one hygher/ and the other lower/ that a man maye set the horse as 
depe or shalowe as he list/ the water increasinge or decreasynge accordinge 
to the holdinge in or lettinge out of the water. 
 
I thinke verely that the bath of brimstone within the space of a moneth 
wil heale splentes/ spauines/ and all knobbes/ hard lumpes and swellinges/ 
if they be not verye olde/ frettishinge or founderinge facies or fashones/ and 
al such like disease that are without/ if the horses by the aduise of a cunning 
horsleche haue geuen them conueniente drinckes them before they come to 
the bath/ and orden for them such emplasters and pouders as are mete for 
them to vse in the bathynge tyme/ but whylse they stande restinge them selues 
oute of the bathe. And my aduise is that they that haue not muche money 
to bestowe vpon horsleches/ that they laye in good quantite the slyme 
and groundes of the bathe vpon the sore places of the horsses all that tyme 
that they are oute of the bathe/ restinge them in the stable betwene one bathynge 
tyme and an other. But I woulde not that anye man shoulde vnderstande 
me here that I woulde not that the horse shoulde be exercised in 
theyr bathinge tyme/ for that is not my meaninge/ for I would that a horse 
shoulde be as well exercised as a man/ and so muche more as he is stronger 
then a man/ excepte the diseases be in his fete/ and then are they more measurablye 
to be exercised. As for the diet whyche men shoulde kepe at thys 
bath of Baeth/ it shall be taught amongest other generall ruelles in the end 
of thys boke. 
 
[}Of the Embss bathe besyde Confluence in the diocese of Triuer, 
otherwise called Trier.}] 
 
[^f.3r^] 
IN the diocese of Triuer about four English miles from Conflue~ce 
vpon the other syde of the Rene amongest a greate sorte of hyghe 
hylles in a valley by a litle riuer syde/ is a fayre and well fauored 
bath called Embs bath. There are as I do remembre thre springes/ 
and of euery one/ maketh a bathyng place/ whyche is very well couered 
aboue. And there are chambres inough wyth beddes in them nere the 
bathes/ where in men maye quickly go into/ after that they be bathed. 
 
The miner or mater that thys water rynneth thorow/ where of it hath 
hys vertue/ is Brimstone/ alum/ and as Driander writeth salt. But when 
as I was there in serching for the chefe miner/ that shoulde geue the chefe 
streingth vnto the water/ I perceyued that there was muche alum/ som 
brimstone/ and as far as I could gather som mixture of yron/ rather then of 
salt: for I coulde perceyue by no wit that I had/ anye token of salt there. 
 
[}The vertues and properties of these Bathes.}] 
 
THese bathes are good to heat and to drye the cold and moyst ioyntes/ 
and to scoure them from fleme: wherfore they are for the wild 
or rinning goute/ for the vnfelinge and slepinge membres. 
 
They are good for the palsey/ for the colick/ for the flixe/ and for 
the stone in the kidnees. 
 
They warme a womannis mother/ wherefore they will make weomen 
fruytfull/ if they be let blood in the mother veyn before/ and be wel purged 
of suche humores/ as are the hinderance of conception. 
 
They are good for old & cold sores/ for al kindes of scabbes & scuruines. 
 
These bathes are wyth lesse then two dayes iorney of the noble and famous 
citye of Colon/ where as a man y=t= is disposed to come to Embs bath/ 
maye prouide himselfe there of all thinges necessary/ both concerning medicines/ 
and also concerning good biere/ if any man can no drinke in the bathing 
tyme anye wine. There may also a man haue good counsell of learned 
phisiciones: where of ye shall fynde no store/ after ones that ye are passed 
from Colon. Therefore it were wisdome to prouide you of all these forsayde 
thinges before ye go out of Colon/ for allthough Confluence be a good 
citye/ yet ye maye misse of all the forsayd thynges/ when as ye haue moste 
nede of them/ if ye bringe them not wyth you. 
 
[}Of the Bath called in Duche VVeissbaden, that 
is the whyte Bath.}] 
 
IN the diocese of Mentz wythin the Lordshippe of the Earle of 
Nassow are bathes/ whych were ones called Thermæ mattiacæ in 
Latin/ and now in Duche Weiszbaden. They are thre litle English 
miles from Mentz vpon y=e= other syde of the Rene. The mater 
or miner that geueth these bathes theyr chefe streingth/ is brimstone w=t= 
a litle alum and salpeter. One of these bathes is so hote that a man maye 
scald hennes and pigges/ and seth egges in it. Therefore it is verye euel for 
them that are cholerik and of an hote complexion. 
 
[^f.3v^] 
[}The nature and vertues of these bathes.}] 
 
These bathes are good for stiffe synewes. 
 
They heate muche membres that are foundre or fretished wyth colde/ 
and bringe them to theyr naturall heate agayne. 
 
They heale wounderfullye scabbes and olde sores/ and wythin a shorte 
tyme drye vp such humores as fall vpon the ioyntes. 
 
[}Of the bathes in the Markisdom of Baden in hygh Germany.}] 
 
THe bathes of Baden in high Germany are in the Markisdome of 
Baden betwene the famous flode the Rene/ and the black or martian 
wod. The toune and hole countre haue theyr names of these 
bathes. These bathes are so hote that they will seth egges harde/ & 
scalde swyne and hennes/ so that the here and fethers will lightly come of. 
And yet for all that/ as certayne writers beare witnes/ a man can not get 
the hole profit or fruyte of these bathes in lesse space then sixe or seuen wekes. 
Because the brimstone beareth so mall ruel. These bathes haue muche 
salpeter and alum/ and som brimstone in them. But I coulde marke no token 
at all of brimstone/ when I was there/ and I coulde perceyue no great 
lyke tyhod of any alum there. 
 
[}The vertues of these Bathes.}] 
 
These bathes are good for them that are shortwinded and are stopped 
in theyr brestes and longes/ and can not take theyr breth/ excepte they 
sit or stand right vp. They are good for all the diseases of the ioyntes/ as for 
the hand euell/ for the foote euell/ and for the sciatica/ or the payne whych is 
in the huckel bones/ if the diseases come of a colde cause. 
 
It is good for the dropsey/ and namelye for the fyrste two kindes/ that 
is for the hole dropsey that runneth ouer the hole bodye/ and the bottel dropsey 
whych is about the stomack. And I iudge that the vapoure/ smoke or 
breth of it is also good for the thyrde kinde/ called the tympaine. And so is 
the mudde or claye that is in the bottome of it/ layd vpon the swelled place 
and dryed vp ether in the hote sonne or ellis agaynste a warme fyre. 
 
It is good for the cold diseases of the mother/ and for them that are vexed 
wyth the whyte floures. 
 
They are good for bareyne weomen that can not conceyue/ as it hath 
bene oft tymes knowen by experience. 
 
It is good for all old sores and all diseases of the skinne/ as for scabbes/ 
scurf/ and maungines/ and suche lyke diseases. 
 
It is good for them that haue anye tremblinge membre/ and for suche 
membres as are num or slepe as som calleth them. 
 
It is good for the crampe and for all colde diseases and moyste of the 
synewes. 
 
It is good for them that are oft combred wyth the synginge in theyr 
eares. 
 
[^f.4r^] 
It is good for them that haue a colde and moyst stomack and therefore 
haue euill digestion. 
 
It is good for them that are diseased in the milt or leuer if the siknes come 
of a cold cause and a moyst. 
 
It is good for the~ that are diseased with the stone/ and for suche as haue 
any knoppes or hard swellinges vpon any membre. 
 
It is good for them that haue theyr legges blowen or puffed vp wyth 
wynde. 
 
It is good also for old seares and markikes or foul spottes/ whych haue 
commed ether by strypes or of woundes or sores or byles. 
 
And although thys bath be very good for all these forenamed diseases/ 
yet it is most commended for healing of the goute in the fete. 
 
This bath is not farr from Argentine/ otherwyse called Strasburge/ 
where as both good councell maye be hadd of learned Physicianes/ and 
also good stoore of all good medicines/ necessarye for all maner curable diseases. 
 
[}Of the wilde Bathes.}] 
 
IN the Dukedome of Wirtemberg/ not farre from a toune called 
Chalb/ is a bath called Wild Bathes/ of a great wild wodde 
called in Duche Schwartzwalde/ in Latin Sylua martiana/ 
and the same is the hygher part of the great wildernes/ called of 
the old writers Hyrcinia sylua. These waters haue theyr streingth of brimstone/ 
salte and alum. Som do thynke that there is som copper myngeld 
with the forsayd matters. Golden finger one that hath writen of this bath/ 
sayth that it is warme and not hote/ because they haue but littel brimstone 
and salpeter naturall. Yet for all that/ by this reason they seame to haue 
muche brimstone/ because they will dispache a man in xiiij. dayes of suche 
diseases as they are ordeined of God to heale. Ioannes Folsius one that 
wrote also of thys bath/ sayeth: That a man shoulde sitt in this bathe at the 
fyrst but a shorte whyle/ and that by littell and littel/ so maye increase y=e= houres 
of sittinge in it/ and that a man maye sit in it ten houres. But I thynke 
ten houres are a great deale to manye/ excepte a man haue a verye stronge 
nature. 
 
[}The vertues of this Bath.}] 
 
THis bath is good for all diseases of the heade. 
 
ij It is good for the crampe/ for the palsey/ and for the numnes of anye 
membre. 
 
iij It is good for the singinge in the eares. 
 
iiij It is good agaynst the stoppinge of the milt and liuer. 
 
v It is good for the dropsey and for the iaundes or guelsought. 
 
vj It is good for the stone both in the kidnees and also in the bladder. 
 
vij It is good for them that haue loste theyr appetite/ and haue ether none 
at all/ or small desyre to eate. 
 
[^f.4v^] 
It is good for the brayne to scoure it of all suche humores as brede diseases 
in it. 
 
But thys bathe as the learned phisiciones that dwell not farre from it 
haue experience of the properties of it/ holde that it is more mete and holsome 
for men/ then for weomen. 
 
[}Of the Soure bathe}] 
 
IN the Dukedom of Wirtenberge in Swaberland at Goppingen/ there 
is a bathe/ whyche is called in Duche Saur brunn/ that is in Englishe 
Sour brun/ because the water of the bathe is soure. Fuchsius sayeth/ that 
there is som brimstone in it/ but nether he nether anye other wryter that I 
can rede of/ sheweth anye other miner or matter whyche gyueth thys soure 
taste in to the water. As yet I haue not ben there to trye what matter is 
mixed wyth the brimstone/ wherfore I can not vndoutedlye tell what matter 
it is. But I reken in my mind it is Alum/ whych in other bathes/ where 
it is much/ geueth such a tast vnto them. 
 
[}The vertues of the bathe.}] 
 
j This bath is good for membres out of ioynte. 
ij It comforteth and streingtheneth the stomack. 
iij It is good for the dropsey/ and for the iaundes and for corrupte and 
rotten humores. 
iiij It is good for the troblesome colik. 
v The water of this bath dronken/ kylleth wormes. 
vj Some writers holde that this bathe is good for a tertian Agewe 
and that it maketh a man haue a good appetite. 
vij The water of this bathe dronken in great quantite/ hurteth no man/ 
as the report is/ and therfore manye that dwell aboute it/ carye great tunnfulls 
of it awaye/ and drinke it in theyr houses. 
 
[}Of the bath called Baden in Schwicherlande out of 
Sebastian Munster.}] 
 
BAden is a toune in Schwicherlande by the ryuer called Lymagus/ 
so nere vnto Zurich the head toune of Schwicherlande/ 
that a man maye go from the bath to it in the space of foure houres. 
Beneth the whyche toune of Baden springe vp diuerse and 
manye welles and springes/ whyche are so goodlye and pleasant/ that I neuer 
sawe in anye place more pleasaunte and more inhaunted then they be. 
Thys place was knowen in the tyme of Cornelius Tacitus/ and before his 
tyme/ for he maketh mention of it after this maner. It is a goodly pleasant 
place/ and hath holsome waters/ and a wounderfull stronge castell besyde 
the riuer that renneth by. Hote well springes gusche oute both on this syde 
and on the farther syde of the floude/ and in the floude. The heat in y=e= spring 
is so great/ that if thou be naked/ thou canst not abyde it. 
 
[^f.5r^] 
[}Out of Henrichus Gulden finger, who wrote also of this bathe.}] 
 
THe toune of Baden standeth by the floude Lindemacus in a pleasaunt 
place/ and in an holsome ayer/ and there is plenty inough of 
al thinges. The streingth of brimstone doth beare chefe rule in the 
bathes/ that are aboute thys toune/ and I thynke there is a small 
deale of alume menged with the brimstone. They are holsommest in Maye 
and in Iune. They are not chaunged or altered wyth any changes of tempestes 
of the ayer/ be they neuer so great. Yet are they hoter in winter then 
in somer. In the Springe and in Authume or in the later heruest they scatter 
muche brimstone abrode. It that swimmeth aboue/ whyther it come ple~tuouslye/ 
or after the maner of smal mootes/ or of ashes if it be gathered and 
caste into the fyre/ it will burne. 
 
[}The vertues of these Bathes.}]

[}VVhat Diet is to be kept in these bathes out of Gulden finger.}] 
 
YE must not vse these bathes excepte youre bodye be fyrste purged in a 
fayr wether and an holsome. If that mennis bellis that bathe them/ 
be drawen in toward the back/ then is there good hope/ but if they be puffed 
vp and bowne or be greued wyth gnawynges that is an euell token. 
Ye muste continue in thys bathe euerye daye seuen houres/ foure houres 
before diner/ and thre after diner/ so that a conueniente tyme maye go betwene 
the seconde bathynge and the diner tyme/ that the bellye in the meane 
tyme maye be well refreshed and stretched oute. Whyles ye are in the 
bathes/ ye must nether eate nor drinke/ nor slepe. 
 
I counsell leane and weake men/ that they abyde not longe in the bathes. 
They that are lustye as I sayd before/ maye tarye foure houres before 
diner/ and thre houres after diner. And weomen that are colde of complexion 
and not thurstye/ maye tarye in the bathe viij. or ix. houres euery daye. 
After thys maner of tarying in the bathe/ thou shalt nede no tary no lenger 
then xv. dayes at the moste. But if any will tarye lenger tyme as twintye 
dayes or mo/ then muste he tarye in the bathe fewer houres/ then I haue 
spoken of. 
 
Bannish all heuines/ pensyuenes/ and sadnes away/ and refreshe youre 
selfe wyth honest myrthe. 
 
After that ye haue taken a sober diner/ ye must walke in some pleasaunt 
place/ whylse the meate go doune to the botome of the stomack. 
 
The broth of stewed hennes/ seasoned wyth spices/ is good meat in autumne 
or in the later haruest. 
 
All kindes of pulse as beanes/ peasen/ phaselles and ciches/ are to be 
eschewed/ but the broth of them maye be partelye alowed/ and namelye of 
ciches and husked peasen: the brothes of the other if nede do not require/ I 
would not haue greatly vsed. Ye must forbeare from fruytes and chese/ except 
ye vse any of them at a tyme for a medicine. 
 
Youre wyne must be cleare and well belayd/ accordinge vnto the tyme 
of the yeare/ and the streingth and wekenes of the wyne. 
 
Ye must forbeare from cleare water vnmenged wyth wyne. 
 
Ye must washe nether youre head/ nor anye other parte of youre bodye 
wyth anye other water then that whych is drawen out of the bathes. 
 
After that ye haue departed from the bathes/ ye must not within ix. dayes 
go into any sweating or bath stoue. 
 
[}Of the incommodities and commodities of this bath out of 
Conrade Gesner, a man well learned and 
borne very nere vnto it.}] 
 
THat these bathes do hurte diuers/ that chaunseth ether by the reason of 
there diseases/ whereunto the bath is not naturally geuen to heale/ or 
[^f.6r^] 
if it be fit for the diseases it co~meth by euell & wanton diet which is muche 
more hurtful then at home. For both their poures and strength are resolued 
awaye w=t= the bath & rawe humores are caried hastelye into the veynes of 
to muche meat and drinke or els of such as is taken out of season/ and euill 
humores gathered ether of euill diet/ or of meates of euill substaunce are the 
more spedelye caried into the harte/ and other principall me~bres by the heat 
of the bath made to flowe/ or els are melted into them. 
 
The most parte hauing no regard nether vnto the time nor vnto mesure 
gluttenusly eat both in the bath and out of it/ and for their pleasure drincke 
daylye diuerse kindes of wines/ and drink wyth theyr co~panyons for their 
pleasure excessiuelye wyne/ and that vnmenged/ but also milke/ whaye and 
colde water/ flowyng out of the well or riuer/ or warme oute of the bathes. 
Some eate fruyte both good and badde/ and all that euer co~meth to hand. 
Many not accustomed to wyne at home/ or els very litle/ beyng well exercised/ 
when they come to the bathes/ drinke it plentuouslye wythout exercise/ 
and so are sodenly filled. Some other for nygardnes/ or for pouertye when 
they come to the bathes/ eat euell and vnholsome meates/ because they are 
good cheape/ and then beynge vnexercised as they hadde wont to be make 
much euill humores and euill blood/ whyche thynge maketh many fall into 
worse diseases at the bath/ then they broughte wyth them thyther. Some 
there be whych lyke vnto duckes/ continue day and night in the bath ether 
no tyme or very small goynge betwene theyr meat taking and theyr goyng 
in to the bath agayne. 
 
Wherefore it is no wounder that many euen at the bathes/ or not longe 
after they be commed home/ fall into colikes/ eye sores/ and agues/ and diuerse 
suche like diseases. I heare saye that in diuers circles or goynges aboute 
of yeares/ the nature of the bathes is sharper. When I was in these 
bathes/ I marked that manye mennis eyes were hurte/ and broughte to 
greate heate/ and the reporte was that the nynth yeare before that the same 
thinge chaunsed. But the moste parte were shortelye healed/ euen beynge 
yet at the bathes. 
 
The custome of this oure tyme is/ that the commune sorte of men shulde 
tarye in these bathes a moneth/ and that riche folke abyde longer/ and to 
sit manye houres in the bath. And they are not content to haue their vpper 
skinne to be broughte of ones/ to be healed agayne/ but twyse or thryse they 
will haue so. My councell is that accordinge to the diuersite of the sicknes/ 
agues/ strength/ and other circumstaunces/ that some shoulde abyde but 
fewe dayes in the bath/ other many dayes/ some to haue there skinne blistered 
ones/ and other twyse or ofter/ but that some be not ones. As touchinge 
the drinkinge of the water of the bath/ I woulde alowe but fewe to drinke 
it/ except it be dronken/ scarsely to quench thurste/ which thing the hote water 
that commeth out of the pipes will do. Perchaunce it might be good for 
the diseases of the breste/ but it weakeneth both the ouerparte and netherparte 
of the stomack/ and enlargeth to much som mennis kidnees and bellies/ 
that somtyme they put furth grosse matter/ and somtime bloode. Som 
drinke the water to make them go to stole/ but they must drinke it in greate 
plentie/ and walke after it. 
 
[^f.6v^] 
The opinion of the common people is foolish whyche holdeth that all diseases 
that are taken in the bathe maye be holpen by the bath agayne. For allthough 
it maye chaunce that the bath bewraye and bringe oute some diseases/ 
whych before lurked and were hyd in the bodye and afterwarde maye 
waste vp the matter of the same diseases/ euen as the falling sicknes is both 
bewrayed and also healed by the same medicines/ yet for all that manye diseases 
may arise in the bathinge tyme by yll diet/ whych the bath can neuer 
heale. The commune people holdeth that men haue vsed this bath longe inough/ 
when as a litle water is put vpon the holow parte of their handes is 
strayte waye dryed vp. But if any entring into the bath euen at the fyrst entringe 
thynke for a space that he is burned or bitten/ and a litle whyle after 
waxeth colde/ it is thought wysdome for him to leaue of bathynge: because 
he ether hath bath inough/ or els to muche. 
 
[}Of the Pepper bathe}] 
 
PEpper bath is called of the hyghe Almaynes Pfefferbad/ and of 
some Latin writers Therme fabarie. This bath is in the lande of 
Rhetia/ in the diocese of Cure/ about ten miles from the fyrste vpspringinge 
of the Rhene. This bath doth not springe all the yeare 
thorowe/ but at certayne tymes/ for they springe oute wyth the herbes/ as 
Munster in his Cosmography writeth/ and departe awaye agayn into the 
earth wyth the same. And Fuchsius sayeth that this bath beginneth to springe 
euery yeare the thyrde daye of May/ and goeth into the earth agayn the 
fourth daye of September. The miner and matter that this water rinneth 
ouer and thorow/ wherof it taketh his streingth and vertue is gold/ brimstone/ 
and naturall salpeter. 
 
This bathe is in comparison of other bathes milke warme/ and of suche 
metely warmenesse/ that they that bath in it/ nether are cold/ nor yet sweat 
for heate. Wherefore it is not vnlike to be true that Guldenfinger and Fortzius 
do write/ that it is good both for colde and hote complexions/ and for 
all agues. Some are dispatched of their diseases here in sixe dayes/ some in 
ten/ som in twelff/ and other in longer tyme/ accordinge vnto the diuersities 
of mennes natures/ bringinge vp/ and diet kepte there/ and after the nature 
of the diseases that men come to be heales of. For some disease require a longer 
tyme then other do.

xxiiij It is also good for digestion. 
 
Hytherto haue I writen of the bathes that are in England and in Germany. 
But now because there are certayne bathes in Ytalye/ whiche haue 
the nature and power to heale certayne diseases/ that ether none in England 
nor Germanye is able to do/ or els can in shorter tyme or more surelye 
helpe/ then they of England and of Germanye are able to do. I will also for 
the loue that I beare vnto my contrey men/ write of the most famouse and 
holsommest bathes/ for healinge of straunge diseases and hard to heal/ that 
are in all Italye. 
 
[}Of the bath called Aponus or Ebanus out of 
Michael Sauonarola.}] 
 
THe bath of Apon or Eban is v. italian miles from the city of Padwaye/ 
in the costes of the land therby/ called Ebanum. That land 
was ones great and mightye placed besyde hilles/ in whose playnes 
[^f.7v^] 
there is an hillock or littel hill standinge vp wyth no great heigth/ oute 
of which spring diuers littel brokes or burnes/ whych make manye bathes. 
For the water of the fyrst springe in goyng doune/ so abateth his heate/ that 
men may bath them selues in it. But that place is farre from valleyes/ and 
compassed round about with fruytfull grounde/ and is fre on euery syde sauing 
that towardes the West it is a littel couered with S. Daniels mountayne. 
Howbeit that is but an hillock of small heigth. Doutlesse it is a place 
and dwellinge agreyng wyth mans helth/ and very delitefull/ which thing 
had not nede to be vnloked to of them that shoulde entre into anye bathes. 
Yet is the place windye/ wherefore when the bathers are bathed/ and go 
furth of the bath/ let them stande well couered/ and close from the wind/ lest 
the ayer entre in and hurte them/ whylse theyr poores are as yet open. But 
the water running from that spring and bathes hyther and thyther/ and in 
some places holde~ in hooles/ doth alter and changeth the ayer/ which thing 
is oft the cause/ that some rinning to the bathes/ and kepe no good ruell/ fall 
syke thereby/ of whych thyng I shall speake more hereafter. 
 
[}Of the Miner or Min matter that beareth the chefe rule 
in this bath out of the same author.}] 
 
ARistotel in hys boke of the propertye of the Elementes amongst other 
hath marked two thinges/ wherby the miner or metall/ or vayne of a 
bath may be knowne/ that is to wete/ by the coloure and by the tast. As for 
the knowyng by stilling that shall be spoken of her after. The water of this 
bath is knowen to be salte and alumish/ and haue some part of brimston as 
may by sight be well perceyued som deale of ashes. For as it runnes doune 
by the stony canales and littel riuers/ that are brought out from his dreggy 
parte/ the most part is found alumish and salt/ and a small part brimstonish. 
For although a saffronish coloure appere brimstonish wythout in these places: 
as these diuerse coloures are sene/ so are in y=e= raynbow sene thre colours 
one saffronish/ another rede/ and the thyrde grene. If ther were much brimstone/ 
the brimstone should haue much clammines/ and should haue more of 
the yelowe colour/ then any other minerall/ whiche we set not to be so. Whe~ 
as also of all other minorallis brimstone hath the strongeste sauour/ if there 
were any such/ we should w=t= our smelling smell it/ which thinge we can not 
do. For in suche bathes wherein brimstone beareth the rule/ these two thinges 
are perceyued there/ a yelow colour/ and the smell of brimstone/ as a ma~ 
may playnly find in the bath of Petriol and Cicilia/ & such other like. Wherfore 
I wil not say that these haue brimstone/ bearing y=e= chefe ruel/ but alume 
& that there is more salt in them/ then brimstone. The best tyme of goyng in 
to these bathes/ is from the beginninge of May/ vntill the middest of Iune. 
The constitution of which tymes he that will be bathed/ must marke/ that 
it be not to hote/ nor to colde/ nor to windye/ nether to raynye. Whiche thinges 
do not only alter and chaunge the water of the bathes/ but also the ma~: 
wherby it chaunseth offt tymes/ for lacke of regarde vnto these/ many fal oft 
tymes sicke/ and many tymes dye. And it is also good tyme to vse these bathes/ 
from the middest of August/ vnto the ende of September. 
 
[^f.8r^] 
And suche a bath is moste to be co~mended whyche lieth open to y=e= ayer/ 
whose vapores blowe abrode/ and are purged wyth the heate of the sunne/ 
and so made good/ where as mens heades ache not by the meanes of penned 
or closed in vapours/ are hurte. 
 
And if it be an vnsufferable raynye/ windye or colde wether/ then it 
shall be good to carye of the water of the bath into a chamber/ and there to 
bath you in a tonne/ and if nede require to make good fyre there. And this 
rule is not only to be kepte in this bath when nede requireth/ but also in all 
other suche lyke. 
 
I hold also that the water of any bath caried in tonnes far of/ ether hath 
littel or no streingth in comparison of it/ that is in his naturall place. 
 
Thys is also my councell/ that men rynne not to the vsynge of bathes 
for euerye light cause/ but only for suche diseases as almoste the Phisiciones 
dispaire of. 
 
[}The vertues of this Bathe.}] 
 
THe nature of thys bath is very hote and drye/ wherefore it is good to 
take the water of it/ and to poure it doune vpon the mouldes of y=e= heades 
of them that haue a moyst and a colde catar. 
ij It is good for them also that haue their brestes full of moysture and 
hurte wyth colde. 
iij It is good for them that haue a moyst stomak/ and the dropsey & windines 
or vpblowynge in the bellye. 
iiii It is good for swellinge of the milt/ to take it quite awaye. 
v It is good for old frettinges gnawyn wild/ and rinning sores/ for tetters 
and ringwormes/ for scabbes and scurffines/ and all kindes of maungines/ 
as we haue learned oft by experience. 
vj It is good for the ache of the ioyntes/ and for the goute whyche commeth 
of a cold and moyst cause. 
vij This bath is good for them that haue anye bone broken and growen 
together agayne/ for it sterketh and streingtheneth verye muche the broken 
place/ and setteth the ioyninge faster together. 
viij The water of this bath louseth the bellye/ and bringeth fourth tough 
humores. And the commune measure is from one pounde vnto thre. Howbeit 
halfe a pound will purge as it hath ben proued: when it is dronken/ it 
troubleth the stomack much/ and maketh men vomit. Wherfore it were better 
to take thys water in by a clister. 
ix This bath is also verye good to stoppe the whyte floures/ and for the 
mother that is to muche moyste wyth manye louse humoures/ whereby is 
hindered conception. And thys bath wyth hys vapoures and smoke alone 
receyued accordingly into the mother/ doth rectifye it/ and disposeth it/ and 
prepareth it to conception. In the tyme of Cermyson/ a certayn woman beynge 
baren twelff yeares/ by the councell of him came and vsed this bathe/ 
and shortelye after conceyued. 
 
Hetherto I haue written of these bathes after the minde of Sauinorola 
who doth not deny/ but y=t= all y=e= bathes about Padway are of one nature. 
[^f.8v^] 
Then when as the excellent learned man Ioannes de Dondis/ whom also 
Sauinorolla doth hyghly commend/ writeth thus as I shall here after declare 
of all the bathes of Padwaye in general/ he geueth also the properties 
folowyng vnto the bathes of Apon. His wordes are these. 
 
The bathes of Padway therfore are good for al cold and moyst diseases 
of the heade/ as are the drusye euill, the great forgetfulnes and catharres co~ming 
of colde causes. 
 
They are good for the palsey/ for the setting of the mouth awaye/ for the 
moyst crampe/ for the necke that is stretched to far one way with the cra~pe 
or is made stiffe therewith. For numnes of membres/ and for membres that 
for cold haue almost lost all felinge. 
 
They are good for all moyste and waterye diseases of the eyes and the 
eares/ wherefore they are good for wateringe eyes/ and for the dymnes of 
syghte/ that commeth of to muche water fallen into the eyes. For the singing 
of the eares/ and for dulnes of hearinge that commeth of flegmaticke 
and moyste and colde humores. 
 
They are also good for them that can not perfectly smell. 
 
They are good for the toth ach/ for y=e= teth that are on edged/ for the colde 
and chyllinge of the teth/ for the rustines of the teth/ for the sofftines of the 
gummes/ for the wastynge vp of the colde and moyste humoures that falleth 
vnto them. 
 
They are good for the swellinge of the iawes/ of the throte and of the 
vuula. 
 
They are good for the diseases of the longes and winde pipe or throppel 
and for all cold and moyst diseases of the brest/ and especially for the catar or 
reume/ for horsenes/ and shortwindines comming of colde causes. 
 
They are good for fearfulnes of the hart/ and for the much panting and 
trembling of it/ if they come of cold and moyste causes. 
 
They are good for the lousnes and to muche sofftnes of the pappes & for 
their vnreasonable bignes/ for to muche plentye of milke/ and they are good 
agaynst the waterishnes/ and to muche fynenes of the same. 
 
They are good for the lousnes & flashnes of y=e= stomack/ for the weknes of 
y=e= same/ & for an euill appetite/ & an euil digestion/ and the slipperines of y=e= stomack 
whych maketh that it can not well holde any meat. 
 
They are good for the weakenes of the guttes and the to much slipperines 
of them/ for the flixe/ slippery flixe/ and for colde and windye diseases of 
the guttes. 
 
They are good for the fallinge doun of the guttes and for the Emrodes 
that come of moysture. 
 
They are good for cold men and weomen that by the reason of to much 
coldnes and moysture can haue no childer. 
 
They are good also for the bursting y=t= commeth of to much moystnes. 
 
They are good for them that are to fatt and fleshlye/ for it will make the~ 
leaner/ if they vse it in dewe tyme/ wyth good diet according vnto the order 
of Physick. The water of thys bath is good to be dronken/ to scoure 
the stomack and the guttes/ and to minish the greatnes of the milte and 
the liuer/ and to deliuer them from stoppinge. 
[^f.9r^] 
xvij If anye man be disposed to drinke of these waters/ lette hym vse thys 
manner. Let hym drinke the water fastinge in the morninge warme/ and 
so warme as he can take it for hurtinge of hym selfe wyth the heate of it. 
And lette hym beginne at the fyrste wyth a littel/ and so go forward by degrees 
vntill he maye receyue a iust or sufficient quantite. 
xviij They that woulde vse the smooke or vaperouse ayer of this water/ 
they must let a littel celle or littel chambre be made aboue the hotest part of 
the bath/ that the vapoure and smoke may stryke right vp/ vpon suche places 
as had nede of them. Thys kinde of perfuminge and receyuinge of 
the ayer of the bathes prouoketh sweate mightelye/ and bringeth furth in 
plentye waterish humoures/ whych are in the body/ and it is of more might 
then is the bathinge it selfe in the water/ and worketh more easelye. Doutlesse 
thys kinde of perfuminge is a singuler remedye to melte and dryue awaye 
the waterishnes of the dropsye/ for all weakerye diseases of the ioyntes/ 
and for to make them lener that are to fat and to grosse. 
 
[}Of the Calderane bathes besyde Verona.}] 
 
THe Calderane bathe is in a village called Ganderinum/ as Nicolaus 
Massa sayeth in the land or felde of Verona/ almoste ten miles 
from the cytie towarde the East/ at the sckirtes of bottomes of 
certayn hillockes/ whych are pleasant and lusty to loke vnto. And 
there are two places out of the whych the waters that make the bathes do 
spring. The one is lyke a Theatre/ compassed round about with a wal/ and 
hath certayn greeses to go doune by. The other is open and not defended 
aboute wyth anye wall or other defence/ into the whyche they go that will 
bath them selues. The one is but a good stone caste from the other. The 
ground of these bathes is sandye/ and the sande is rustye to a mans syghte. 
The water floweth not continuallye/ nether in one place colde/ but rather 
blood warme. It is exceding clere/ and doth not excede in any taste/ for it is 
nether swete nor bitter. Yet it semeth to shewe a littel saltisnes. If there be 
anye thinge besyde/ it maye be layde to the smell and qualitie of brimstone. 
Therfore thys minorall water is cleare (and not manifestlye hoote) & springeth 
out of sande. Whose taste is nether muche saltish/ nor swete nor bitter/ 
but in a meane with some menginge with mixture of brimstone. It hath a 
muddye taste in a mannis mouth. But wythout all doute the cheafe miner 
or matter that thys water goeth ouer/ or thorowe as all the learned men 
that haue written/ beare witnes/ is yron. Bolderius one borne in Uerone
