[}A THEATER 
OF THE PLANETARY 
HOVRES FOR ALL THE 
DAYES OF THE 
YEARE.}] 
 
HIs divine Majestie out of the 
inevacuable source of his 
vncreated wisedome, by his 
infinite providence, in the 
Creation of this great vniverse, 
did establish all the 
creatures for his glory, and 
the benefit of men. In so 
much that the earth, his foo stoole, embellished 
with so many beautifull creatures, doth abound 
in plants, hearbs, trees, seedes, barkes, woods, 
gummes, iuices, mettalls, mineralls, and demy-mineralls, 
All, as Moyses saith in the first of his 
Genesis, Vt ijs subinde ad propulsandos morbos vteretur 
ab Adam propagata soboles, That Adams progenie 
might vse them to preserue health: And the 
living creatures in so many severall kindes have 
peopled the Sea, filled the ayre, and inhabited 
the earth vnder the government of men, to whom, 
[^p.2^] 
as to their Soveraignes, they ought to be as subjected: 
and the heavens, replenished with a thousand 
glittering lights, the cover of this lower 
world, by their motions and light, being governed 
by the commandement of the supreame mover, 
send downe their powers on men, by intelligences 
moving; the opinions of sacred Theologians, 
as Richardus in his second booke, Art. 3. 
quest. 3. and also Saint Bonaventure, and Saint Thomas, 
who will, that the highest or Empyreall heaven, 
doth infuse some effects into our lower 
earth. It is most certaine that the supreame Creator 
hath ordained the heavens, as all the other 
creatures, not onely for mens present benefit, but 
for that to come; that if the heavens did not infuse 
on vs, it were enough to destroy that most 
great principle of our Religion. And Damas. in 
his 3. booke, Chap. 22. saith in this behalfe, Impossibile 
est aliquam substantiam expertem esse naturali 
operatione, vsui hominum conferente, ergo &c. It is 
impossible, that any substance can bee voyde of 
some naturall operation, conducing to the profit 
of men, therefore &c. 
 
The Theologians gather from the heavens 
three sorts of influences appropriated to the three 
faculties of our immortall soule: The starrie heaven, 
with all the first and wandring starres, powre 
their influences into the Vegetative; the Empyreall 
into the Reasonable; and the Christaline, 
or first mover, iufuse into the Sensitive; neverthelesse, 
none of these influences can force our liberty, 
[^p.3^] 
although the heavens send them the one 
by their motions, the others by their light, and 
the others by their vertue: So the Empyreall 
heaven, without moving its selfe, sendeth downe 
its vertue here belowe, notwithstanding that it 
be distant from vs so farre, that, according to Beda 
in his booke, De imagine mundi, from the earth 
to the firmament, there are three hundreth thousand, 
one hundreth and twenty five leagues. And 
from that, to the Empyreall heaven, are, ten hundreth 
millions of leagues: But to say truth (if it 
be not by revelation from God) no certaine measure 
can be determined. I conclude, A majore ad 
minus, from the greater to the lesser, that, since 
the influences doe descend from such a height, by 
a more strong reason may they come from the 
heavens, that are neere vs; all which influences 
are not in the heavens by their nature, but by 
their effects, as the Astrologians say: If Saturne 
be colde, the cause proceedeth from his motion, 
which is slowe, and lingring, and for that he is so 
farre distant from vs, and doth not end his course 
but in thirty yeares, according to the same Beda: 
Now, the other planets, that are of more speedy 
motion, and doe (as it were) with a swift, and rapid 
course, and in little time, make their Revolution, 
are hot, and dry; as Sol, and Mars: But 
what availeth it vs to bring so farre fetcht reasons? 
Since that, so neere vs, these effects are declared 
vnto vs so evidently, in the foure elements, 
in the living creatures, in the plants, in 
[^p.4^] 
the sea, in the ayre, in cutting, sawing, gathering, 
grafting, and over all the creatures: So that if 
man know not the reason of these things, hee 
ought to seeke it in the myracles of nature. To 
the end then, that euery one may the better 
know, how to make vse of these operations, even 
in matter of Physick, they must chuse the dayes, 
the houres, the plants, vnder such favourable 
aspects, and agreeable influences of the Starres, 
as can, by their agreeable vertue, give health vnto 
the sicke; for the Planets and fixed Starres, 
doe cause all infirmities: wherefore they must 
chuse the Planet, that is enemie to that Planet that 
brought forth that evill; and so, by the contrary 
effect, put it away and dissolue it. Wherefore 
Arnauld of Villeneufe, in his booke, De simplicibus 
Medicina, saith these words, Ad hoc vt ipsæ herbæ, 
flores, radices, & semina, habeant singularem virtutem, 
& proprietatem ad morbos tollendos, sunt Colligenda 
secundum diversa signa Zodiaci, quia citius & 
fælicius operantur in morbis. Moreover, that the 
very hearbs, flowers, rootes, and seeds, may have 
a singular vertue, and quality to remove diseases, 
they are to be gathered according to the severall 
signes of the Zodiack, because so they doe more 
speedily and succesfully worke on diseases. 
 
For which cause, first, I have thought good to 
set downe the Planets in order, and the infirmities 
that are caused by them. 
 
Secondly, the certaine houre of the Sunnes 
rising every day in the yeare, to the end that you 
[^p.5^] 
may easily finde out the houre wherein you are 
to gather or take the plants, stones, or animals, 
to cure your infirmities. 
 
Thirdly, I haue set downe too, the vnequall 
Planetary houre, as well of the day as of the 
night, whereby you may know certainly what 
Planet shall governe. 
 
Fourthly, you have in like order, the friendship, 
and enmity of the Planets; which are enemies 
amongst them; that you may the more easily 
finde the Planet, enemie to it that shall cause 
the disease, and in the same houre that is governed 
by it, the infirmity may be cured. 
 
Lastly, the cures of all vsuall diseases are set 
downe. 
 
[}CHAP. I. 
What the infirmities and diseases are, which are caused 
by every of the Planets.}] 
 
SAturne governing, doth cause all 
cold diseases, as the Gowt in the 
feete, Leprosie, the Scab, the 
Palsie, Quartane Agues, the Dropsie, 
Catarres, Diffluxions on the 
Lungs, Consumptions, Coughes, 
and the like cold and Melancholick infirmities. 
 
Iupiter causeth the Cramp, stupidnesse, inflamation 
[^p.6^] 
of the lyuer, the head-ach, paines in the 
shoulders, the Squinance, Apoplexie, the Cardiaca 
passio or heart sicknesse, the bloudy flux, and 
the like. 
 
Mars causeth burning Feavers, Impostumes, 
tertian, quotidian, and intermitting Agues, Saint 
Antonies fires, Carbuncles, Fistulaes, dissenteries, 
and the like hot diseases. 
 
Sol causeth defluxions and rhewmes that fall 
on the eyes, coldnesse of the stomack, and lyver, 
swoundings, red choller, the Catarre, blisters on 
the Matrice, and such other infirmities on the 
lower parts. 
 
Venus causeth the Scab, the French Pox, the 
Lienterick Flux, Passions and Suffocations of 
the Matrice, and all other diseases of the like nature. 
 
Mercurius causeth hoarcenesse, all passions of 
the senses, the falling sicknesse, common impediments 
of the tongue, and its passions, obstructions 
of the Gall, and all melancholick evils. 
 
Luna causeth the Palsey, the Chollick, the 
termes, the Dropsie, Phlegmatick impostumes, 
and all the infirmities that proceede from the obstruction 
of the veynes. 
 
Now, to cure any of these infirmities infallibly, 
and not as some Physicians proceede, Saluo 
semper iure calculi, keeping still a iust account, it is 
requisite to make vse of Astrologie, & the aspects 
of the starres and of their influences, and that is 
to be vnderstood in cura regulari, in a regular cure, 
[^p.7^] 
and not coacta practica, by forced practise. Wherefore 
in such a case, as Hip. in his fourth booke 
Aphor. 1. willeth vs, Medicari in valde acutis morbis 
eadem die si materia turgeat, tardari in his malum est, 
To vse remedies in very sharpe diseases on the 
first day, if the matter abound; Delayes in these 
are dangerous. Yet Menardus in his Epistles in 
the like case saith, That, potius lotium inspiciendum 
quam astra, The vrine is rather to be looked into 
then the stars. But that is to be vnderstood, for letting 
of blood, and purging the body. But as concerning 
other locall or topicall remedies, it is requisite 
to obserue the Planetarie houres. And 
for this purpose, we must consider by what Planet 
the infirmity is caused, then take the hearbe, 
or flower, seedes, rootes, or such other things, in 
such an houre as shall be governed by the Planet, 
that is enemy to the causer of the evill: Quia 
contraria contrarijs curantur. Contraries are cured 
by their contraries. 
 
Now, for to know the certaine houre of such a 
Planet, you shall marke at what houre of that day 
the Sun shall rise, attributing ever the first houre 
of the Sunen-rising, to the Planet that beares the 
name of that day: As on Sunday the first houre 
shall be the houre of Sol or the Sun: On Monday 
the first houre, shall be the houre of Luna or the 
Moon: On Tues. the first houre, shal be the houre 
of Mars: on Wed. Mercurie governeth the first 
houre: On Thurs. Iupiter: Fridayes first houre Venus 
ruleth: And on the first of Saturday Saturne. 
[^p.8^] 
After the certaine knowledge of the Planet, that 
governeth the first houre of the Sunne-rising on 
every day, you must follow the naturall order of 
the Planets, attributing still the succeeding Planet 
to every succeeding houre. The naturall order 
of the Planets is this, Saturnus, Iupiter, Mars, 
Sol, Venus, Mercurius, Luna. 
 
[}The Planet governour of each day in 
the weeke, is as followeth:}] 
 
The dayes of the weeke, The Planet gover. 
Sunday, Sol, 
Monday, Luna, 
Tuesday, Mars, 
Wednesday, Mercurius, 
Thursday, Iupiter, 
Friday, Venus, 
Saturday, Saturnus.

Saturne. 
 
Mars is a friend to Venus. 
 
Mercury is friendly to Iupiter, Venus, and Saturne. 
 
Iupiter is friendly to Sol, Luna, Mercury, Venus, 
and Saturne. 
 
[}The Planets that are enemies 
one to another.}] 
 
Sol is enemie to Mars, Mercury, and Luna. 
 
Luna is enemy to Mars and Mercurius. 
 
Mars is enemie to Luna, Mercurie, and Saturne: 
but most to Sol and Jupiter. 
 
Mercurie is enemie to Sol, Luna, and Mars. 
 
Iupiter is enemie to Mars. 
 
Venus is enemie to Saturne. 
 
[^p.16^] 
[}Excellent and approved Secrets; 
with the manner how, and when they 
are to be taken, and made, vnder the Influences 
of the Starres, whereby the following 
infirmities may in very short 
time be cured.}] 
 
[}1. Against the headache.}] 
 
IVpiter causeth this evill: Take 
the hearbe called Psilio or Flea-bane, 
in the houre of Mars his 
enemie; stampe it, and mingle it 
with vinegar, and apply it to the 
forehead. 
 
[}2. Against Frenzies or sharpe Feavers.}] 
 
These diseases are caused by Mars: Take 
therefore in the houre of Luna, Mercury, Saturne, 
Sol, or Iupiter his enemies, the milke of any beast, 
except that of Goates; boyle it, and with the 
skinne that swimmes above it, bathe all your 
head. 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}3. To cure the Falling sicknesse.}] 
 
Mercury doth cause this evill: Wherefore in 
the houre of Sol, Luna, or Mars his enemies, you 
must get a Woolfe, and kill it in any of the aforesaid 
houres; take the lights of it, and boyle 
them in red wine, adding thereto some Aromatick 
spices, and when they are sufficiently 
boyled, give them the Patient to eate, and hee 
shall be well. 
 
[}4. Against weakenesses and dimnesse 
in the eyes.}] 
 
Sol is the Author of these infirmities: Take 
in the houre of Mars, his enemie, the hearbe called 
Euphragia, or Eyebright, beaten to powder, 
and mingle it with the yelk of an egge, or wine, 
and lay it on the eyes. 
 
[}5. To cure the waterings and fluxes 
in the eyes.}] 
 
Sol is the cause of this evill: Take therefore 
in the houre of Mars, his enemie, the slymie 
and gummie substance of the Snaile, with which 
you shall mingle Mirrh, Aloes, and Mastick, and 
then apply it to the temples of the head. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[}6. To take away Carnosities 
in the nose.}] 
 
Saturne doth cause this evill: To cure which, 
in the houre of Mars his enemie, you must take 
the hearbe Dragon, and presse out the iuyce of 
it, and mingle it with the milke of wilde Fennell, 
and any sort of Gall, that yee may most conveniently 
come by: Then the powder of Nettle-seede, 
Southernwood, Hellebore, and Cypres: 
mingle all together, and let them be often snuffed 
vp into the nose, and it will infallibly 
cure it. 
 
[}7. Against bleeding at the nose.}] 
 
Saturne causeth this infirmity: Take in the 
houre of Mars his enemie, Balausti, or Pomegranate 
buds, and stampe them to powder, and 
mingle them with the white of an egge, and apply 
it to the nosthrils. 
 
[}8. Against paines and pushes in the eares.}] 
 
Mercury causeth these: Take in the houre of 
Sol or Mars, his enemies, the flower of the Ivie; 
boyle it in oyle, and powre it in the eares, and it 
taketh away those paines. 
 
[^p.19^] 
[}9. Against deafenesse, and bussings 
in the eares.}] 
 
Mercury is Author hereof: Therefore in 
the houre of Sol or Mars his enemies, take a 
Hare, kill it, and wash the gall of it, with which 
yee shall mingle the powder of blacke Hellebore; 
put it in the eares, and it cureth those infirmities. 
 
[}10. To take away Blisters and hackes 
on the lips.}] 
 
Mercury doth likewise cause these evills: 
Take therefore in the houre of Sol or Mars his 
enemies, Litarge of silver, Mirrh, Ginger, of 
each an equall quantity; beate them into very 
fine powder, then with Virgine Wax, Honey, 
and ordinary Oyle, you shall make an Oyntment; 
spread it on any fine cloath, and apply 
it to the lips. 
 
[}11. To ease the paine of the 
Tooth-ache.}] 
 
This evill too is caused by Mercury: Take 
in the houre of Sol, Luna or Mars his enemies, 
two graines of the seede of Acace, of Opium, 
Ioschiamum, of each two drachmes, mixe them 
[^p.20^] [^Original misnumbered as p.14.^] 
with wine, and role them vp like Pills: hold 
one of these betwixt your teeth, and it will 
quickly asswage the paine. 
 
[}12. To make hollow or pained teeth to 
fall of themselues.}] 
 
Mercury is the causer of these: Take in the 
houre of Sol, Luna, or Mars his enemies, the 
branches of wilde Olives, boyle them in veriuice 
till it become as thick as honey; apply it 
to the tainted tooth, and it will cause it fall. 
 
[}13. To strengthen the teeth.}] 
 
This infirmity is caused by Mercury: Take 
in the houre of Sol, Luna, or Mars his enemies, 
the skinnes of Pomegranates, Ireos, burn'd 
Salt, of each two parts, of Gall two parts, of

Divers are the judgements that some men 
give, whether a sicke person shall live or die;

and lay it in the Vrine of the diseased person, 
immediatly after he shall have made water, so 
[^p.31^] 
that the water bee pure from any other minglings 
with it; Then let the Nettle remaine 
therein the space of 24. houres; and thereafter 
if the Nettle be found dry and withered,

it is a signe of life.
