WHan the vryne cometh that hathe

is in the raynes and in the share/ yf it be clere & blackysshe 
tha~ the peyne is in the backe & in the share and

of the vryne whiche thou shall knowe thus. If the 
vryne after his castynge flete full of framell motes/

of brethe & nyppynge of the splen~e. And yf it appere 
in the myddes it betokeneth gryndynge in the body

All this cometh of excesse of meet and drynke. And 
yf they be in the botome the peyne is in the reynes/ & 
[^f.B4r^] 
somtyme it is in y=e= codde. Fat heed without Axcys 
betokeneth wastynge of grece aboute the fundime~t. 
If it be with an Axcys it betokeneth wastynge of y=e= 
body. In the fyrst spyse of the Etyke the fat heed houeth 
aboue the partyes as it were of fat brothe. The 
seco~de spyse that hylleth all the vryne aboue is lyke 
the webbe of Erren. The thyrde spyce the vryne is 
thycke ouer all fatte as oyle/ & yf it be cast on a marble 
stone it sheweth as oyle/ and this spyse is vncurable. 
Uermyn co~te~tes they be lyke to bryne/ somtyme 
rounde as scales of a fysshe. If they appere 
wtthin an Axcys they betoken the fyrst spyse of the 
Etyke they do appere lyke vnto bryne that hathe lytell

Motes that be whyte and small and rounde betokeneth 
the Goute bothe in the man and woman. If 
they appere in the botome it betokeneth the rewmatyke 
Goute bothe in the stomake and in y=e= brest. If 
they do gader than in a rounde gobet and do ly so 
thycke on y=e= botom vnder the cyrcle/ yf they be reedysshe 
and rou~de it betokeneth a man chylde. If they 
be whyte or blo and thynne as scales it betokeneth a 
woman chylde. Heeres that be longe and small yf 
they shewe with an Axcys it betokeneth wastyng of 
the body. And yf with the Axys be a Flyx and these 
heeres appere it betokeneth dethe. Spermatyue 
[^f.B4v^] 
resolucyons yf they appere fletynke aboute in the 
vryne/ and the vryne rawe in coloure it betokeneth 
pyssynge of kynde without lykynge. If the vryne 
be hye of colour it betokeneth that it was made post 
suppositum. Asshes yf they appere in the vryne/ 
and the vryne be whyte of colour/ with resolucyons 
blacke and blo beynge in the botom it betokeneth y=e= 
Emerawdes. Also yf the contentes be blacke or blo 
or Purpur with a lowe coloure it betokeneth stoppynge 
of the flowres. The laste content is called 
Ipostacis. It standeth in the botom brode byneth & 
sharpe vpwarde. If this co~tent be whyte & brode in 
the botom and sharpe vpwarde without brekynge & 
longe lastynge it betokeneth that the seke is worse 
than he was. If it be broken or haue in the myddes 
orels aboute in the partyes it betokeneth that y=e= seke 
man is colde in the lyuer and it may not defy. And 
it be in the myddes/ than it is called Neptilis and 
it betokeneth badde degestyon and lengthe of sekenesse. 
And it be blacke it betokeneth destruccyon of 
kynde and dethe. 
 
NNow haue I shewed you the 
substau~ce of vryns/ y=e= colours/ 
the regyons/ & the contentes 
bylo~gyng to vryns. And now 
wyll I shewe the the compleccyons. 
If the vryne be thycke 
and reed/ than it betokeneth 
blode. And yf it be reed and 
thynne than it betokeneth colour. And it be thycke & 
whyte it betokeneth flewme. And it be whyte and 
[^f.C1r^] 
thynne than it betokeneth malancoly. And yf thou 
knowe the co~pleccyons by the cost of the vryne/ loke 
yf it be swete/ tha~ it betokeneth blode. If it be sowre 
it betokeneth coloure. And it be whyte without sauour 
as water/ it betokeneth flewme. And it be salt 
it betokeneth malancoly. 
 
[}How the compleccyons be gendred.}] 
 
YF thou wyl knowe where these compleccyo~s 
be gendred in a ma~nes body/ 
I say that coloure is gendred in 
the lyuer/ and his dwellynge is in y=e= 
cofer of the gall. Blode is ge~dred in 
the lyuer/ and his dwellynge is in y=e= 
veynes. Flewme that is naturall is engendred in y=e= 
lyuer/ and it hathe no proper dwellynge/ & therfore 
he is medled with the blode to make the blode rennynge.

[}How thou shall dyscerne mannes vryne fro womans 
vryne/ and beestes vryne fro the vryne 
of man and woman.}] 
 
THus I wyll that thou vnderstande 
that yf there be ony drobled in mannes 
vryne it sheweth in the myddes 
of the vryne/ and in the womannes 
vryne it doth not so. Another is this 
the frothe after the castynge of ma~nes 
[^f.C1v^] 
vryne it shalbe longe/ and of a womans after y=e= 
castynge it shalbe rounde. These .ii. last tokens Auycence 
saythe. Now beestes water fro mannes water. 
Beestes water is the sadder and more supple of 
compleccyon. Also the beestes water swelleth more 
than the ma~nes. Another medle the vryne of a beest 
with a mannes vryne/ and they shall parte asondre. 
And it be a Cowe y=t= is with calfe/ it is good to know 
fro a woman that is with chylde/ for the drestes of y=e= 
contentes of the Cowes vryne is moche greater tha~ 
the vryne of a woman/ in asmoche as the woman is 
lesse and fayrer of compleccyon than the Cowe is. 
If thou wyll knowe the fyrst water & the seconde/ 
the godheed sheweth whyther he be in great etynge 
and drynkynge/ and than the fyrst water is greater 
in quantyte or lesse stynkynge than y=e= seconde/ orels 
yf he lyue mesurably/ tha~ the fyrst shalbe more thyck 
than the other. Now haue I tolde the of the substaunce 
with the colours of the vryns and compleccyons/ 
and to knowe mannes vryne and womans 
with chyldes fro the vryne of beestes.
