[}Of burninge vvater or single 
Aqua vitæ, and of the strength therof, 
and manifold vse.}] 
 
BUrnynge water orAqua vitæ is 
drawne oute of wine, but wyth vs 
out of the wine lies only, speciallye 
of them that sell it, and by this onli 
almost get their liuing. And parauenture 
it is neuer a whit y=e= worse 
that it is drawne oute of lies: for Lullus teacheth 
that it may be well destilled of corrupt wine: yea if 
[^p.77^] 
it be destilled often, it shalbe made the more effectuall, 
that is to say, hotter and drier: for dregs also 
or lies brente, are very hot, and geue the hottest 
oyle, which they call oyle de Tartaro, but that burning 
water that is destilled out of wine, me thinkes 
it shalbe the swieter, and more plesaunt bothe 
in smell and taste, and without all brent taste: besides 
that more apte also for quintessens. Burning 
water is called also water of sapa, of whiche & oyl, 
mingled together soope is made, for it brenneth y=e= 
body. This water is made, as lie, half or thre partes 
ashes, and on lime: and that is the strongest 
water that wil make an egge cast therin, to swim 
highest without or aboue the water. Therfore the 
first being so made, is stronger then the second, to 
the vse of searing or burning of woundes. Monachus 
in Mesuæm. 
 
Burning water oft destilled, is broughte into 
such sharpnes y=t= it can not be drunk. Cardan. But 
this is commonly known: they that sell it commo~ly 
are wont to destil it only twise: but to the vse of 
glasiers for the burning in of their colors in their 
glasses, foure times, except I be deceiued. We declared 
afore, how when it is once or twise destilled 
in serpentins or writhen or crouked vessels or in 
other accustomed vessels (with pipes of brasse as 
big as a mans arme) may afterward be perfected 
in ashes, vntill all the fleame be put awaye: by the 
which meanes it is made not only hoter and more 
subtil and finned, but also more pleasaunte bothe 
to the taste and smell. Neither do all men vse one 
[^p.78^] 
forme or fashion of the bodies and heades whiche 
they call limbeckse, to destill all iuyces: for some 
draw the water out of wine put in a great brasen 
vessel, standing vpon the fire, the necke or mouthe 
wherof is great and broad, vpon a three fote, and 
vpon this necke standeth the heade of brasse also 
with a top like a spire steple, & a thing like a paile 
or bucket. D. compassing it, ful of cold water, that 
the large vapoure maye be thickned the soner by 
the head made cold, and least the water of y=e= wine 
should so resemble the fire. Some vse in the stead 
of a necke or heade to receiue the vapoure wyth a 
pipe of white plate or other mettall, verye longe, 
writhen into manye boughtes and tourninges, 
like vnto the maner of serpents, (wherupon they 
name them co~monly serpentins) the greatest part 
therof standing in water. Some haue also yet an 
other fashion, Syluius. We did see diuers fashyons 
of vessels set out in figures to destill burning 
water or aqua vitæ, in Gualter Ryffius & Andro Lonicerus. 
Bulcasis saith wine may be destilled after 
the same maner, as vineger, the destillacion wher 
of he described. Read within, streight after the title 
of destillacion in ashes. 
 
Some make a longe rounde pype. A. [^The index letter refers to the following figure.^] goynge 
vprighte from the couer of the Caudron conteyning 
the wines or lyes, whyche pype is larger beneathe 
after the fashion of a figure in Geometrye 
called conus whiche they bowe at the top almoste 
wyth a streight corner, and by a bucket ful of water 
set somewhat hie, they directe it, but a syngle 
[^p.79^] 
not a crouked nor writhen 
cours: and so they 
say, shall a man haue 
more plenty of water. [^An image of the distillation apparatus omitted.^] 
Suche lyke lyttle instrumentes 
certain apothecaries 
do make, 
and call theim bladdars, 
for thys purpose, 
that if they nede 
anye certaine lyquor 
to the destillacion of anye 
herbe, they maye 
make it by and by. 
Yea they poure water 
vpon it that it be the more plenteous, which I ca~ 
not commend. 
 
Aqua vitæ is thought then to be stilled inough, 
that is, after it be stilled foure tymes at the leaste, 
and pourged from all his fleame, whan as if a 
manne sette it a fyre, it wyll consume euery whit 
wyth the flame, that no token of moysture be lefte 
in the bottome of the vessell: or elsse, if a lynnen 
clothe dipte therein, and sette a fyre, it 
burne not the clothe, whyche is a greatter token 
of perfectyon, as that also, if a droppe of 
Oyle bee lette fall into it, it goeth to the bottome. 
For Oyle is aierye, wherefore a fyrie substaunce, 
whereunto Aqua vitæ soo ofte destylled 
shoulde atteyne, oughte too bee lyghter 
then it. But besydes the heate, of so destylled 
[^p.80^] 
it should also become thin and pure, more & more, 
and when euery fire, the thicker and grosser it is, 
the more it burneth: contrariwise, the thinner, the 
lesse: that which is most thin should burn leaste of 
all. By the same cause it commeth to passe, that a 
drop of Aqua vitæ poured in the palme of a mans 
hand, the better it is, the soner it vanisheth awaye 
and is consumed I heare that this is a laudable 
note of this water, if succinum amber being set on 
fire and put to it into a spone do burn. Whan wine 
(saith Vlstadius .10. chapter.) is destilled twyse or 
thrise, you shall cut a fine sponge into pieces, so 
great, that on euery side they may touch the cucurbita 
or bodye within the vpper parte (that is in the 
inner circuit) the spo~g must be tied in thre or four 
stringes hanging withoute, when you shall set on 
the limbeck, so that the sponge can not fal into the 
bottome of the still: let the sponge be dipt in oyle oliue, 
and crushed out a little again, least perauenture 
the oyle should fall into the pot or body of the 
stil, and be mixt with the matter: then settinge the 
limbeck vpon it, shit it close with wax as is aforesaid, 
or with purified rosen. By this spong the spirits 
shalbe best destilled, and the fleame shall not 
passe through, because of the oyle: & by this menes 
shall a man do more with once destilling, then otherwise 
with thrise. Notwithstandinge the limbeck 
must be made withoute the gutter and circle 
within like to a blinde limbecke, but it muste not 
lacke a nose. Thus saith he. That whiche remayneth 
of the lies and dregs destilled in the bottom, 
[^p.81^] 
y=e= me~ of our time call it dead water: for it is vnsauery 
and stinking. Such, that is the stinking water, 
whether it be yeilden of lies onlye, or also of 
wine, I haue not tried. 
 
For the destillation of aqua vitæ or burning water, 
a man muste chuse the best wine, blacke, red, 
or white. Black and old, yelds more plenty and also 
better water, then any other. The fire at y=e= first 
must be light and soft, & after more veheme~t: but 
you must take hede in anye wise y=t= the wine sethe 
not. The water that is gotten theroute, is surnamed 
burning, or the soul and life of the wine: and 
when it is destilled twise or thrise, then they cal it 
flaming water: Albertus as some alledge. 
 
Of fiue partes of lies, whe~ it is twise destilled 
I heare, one remaineth or somwhat les. Whan y=e= 
fleame is one cleane consumed, nothing is lost after 
in the destilling, but the hole is yeilded again. 
Of .iiii. measures of wine, for the moste parte one 
measure of burnyng water is gathered in the first 
destillacion or there about according to the goodnes 
of the wine. Then in the next destillacion for 
one measure, there commeth the halfe. In y=e= third, 
one part of fiue is co~sumed. In y=e= fourth, as much 
is yelded as you put in, for the most part if the destillacion 
be done accordingly. Notwithstanding 
if you continue destillinge, the water shall be the 
more perfect, in so much that at the ninth or tenth 
destillacion, it shal come out most perfect, But for 
as much as to the repeting of destillinge so ofte: a 
man must bestow both more time and more coste, 
[^p.82^] 
for the most part we are content with the third or 
the fourthe destillacion, and call it perfecte. And 
surely it resteth much in the instrument, that the 
water should be perfected soner or slower. For the 
vapour is more destilled and perfected in the first 
destillacion in a serpentin (that is in a croked and 
bowed pipe) the~ thrise destilled by a streight pipe. 
Note further that ther diuers waters may be gathered 
in the first destillacion, wherof the firste is 
perfit, that is, that whiche burneth and is consumed 
with the fire, and a linnen cloth dipte therin 
and set on fire is not burnt. (You shall proue therfore 
nowe and then, and when the water ceaseth 
burninge, looke what remaineth in the still, you 
may cast it away, as vnprofitable. The second is 
a meane betwene good and bad.) The thirde is 
good for nothinge, saue that it cleareth the eyes 
and the face, if thrise a day they be washte therin, 
morninge, noone and euening, but this vertue of 
the third water, perauenture is true, if the destillacion 
be made with wine: but if it be with lies, as 
they be wonte with vs, it is not true. More ouer 
the stil must not be filled aboue .ii. parts, but that 
the third part may remaine emptye, and that the 
vapoures maye haue their scoupe and romthe 
Hitherto Lullus. 
 
[}Of the strengthes and vertues 
of Aqua vitæ, in the boke of Arnold, 
De Villa noua, which is written 
of Aqua vitæ.}] 
 
[^p.83^] 
ARnold in his boke of Aqua vitæ describeth 
many qualities therof both of it alone, 
and also mixt with other medicins 
after the destillacion, obseruing the order 
of the .xii. signes, from the head to the fete, for 
as he saith, a man must minister much more effectuall 
remedies to the head, if a man haue nede, at 
such time as the mone is in the ram: and likewise 
in the other, which thinge how true I iudge it, I 
wil not say at this time: notwithstanding this wil 
I say, the better learned any man is in oure time, 
the les credit haue they geuen to suche perswacions 
as the Arabians haue broughte into phisicke. 
Aqua vitæ simple and alone (saithe Arnold oute of 
one Theoricus I can not tel whome) breaketh an 
impostume or recours of matter bothe within the 
body, if it be dronke, and without, as botche, if it 
be annoynted therwith. It helpeth read and duskish 
eies. It stauncheth the running and watering 
of the eies. It is good for them that haue the 
falling sickns if they drink it. It cureth the palsy 
if they be anoynted therwith. It sharpneth y=e= wit 
it restoreth memori. It maketh me~ mery & preserueth 
youth. It putteth awai fracins, ring worms 
& al spots of y=e= face. If it gargild it remedieth y=e= diseas 
in y=e= throte called synanchen y=e= squince, & the 
iuila faln down w=t= humors, also the salt fleme, the 
rose drop & the touth ache. It is merueylous profitable 
for fre~tik me~ & such as be mela~choly. It expelleth 
poyso~. The smel therof burnt, killeth flies 
& cold creping beasts, It doth sieth flesh & kepeth 
[^p.84^] 
fishes from roating. It restoreth wine that is turned 
or putrified. It draweth forth the vertues of 
herbes and rotes, if they be laid in it .iiii. daies (otherwise 
.iiii. houres) excepte onlye the Uiolet. It 
oughte to be set vp in a glasen or siluer vessell and 
to be wel stopt. There is more of it & better made 
of old wine pure and read. This he. He that desyreth 
more concerninge the vertues of Aqua vitæ, 
let him read that which we write aboue of y=e= vertues 
of certain liquors, which our men call golde~, 
and waters of vertues. For they ascribe all those 
powers for the most part as well to Aqua vitæ, as 
to the other, specially to simple Aqua vitæ, & much 
more to compound or Aqua composita, but chieflye 
to the quintessens therof. Reade more ouer Lullus 
in the boke of waters. I haue sene also a certaine 
broken worke ascribed to Albertus, of the vertues 
of Aqua vitæ. But practicioners, ignorant of thinges 
and times, or els of a purpose to deceiue me~, 
as many as they could, haue most impudently fathered 
many things vpon Galen, Hippocrates and 
Aristotle of the vertues of Aqua vitæ, or burnynge 
water, as writen by them. All kinde of cold passions 
or greues, that be curable, it helpeth in shorte 
space, specially diseases of the brain, sinewes and 
ioyntes. Also wormes in the bellye, biles and all 
scabbines, if it be washt oft therwith, it healeth it. 
It helpeth y=e= splene, it killeth all wormes. It me~deth 
a stinking breth. It taketh awaye the disease 
of the loines. The hurt members if they be anoynted 
therewith, it will restore them to their former 
[^p.85^] 
health. It preserueth fishe and flesh from corrupting, 
but before they be eaten, they must be washte 
with common water. Camphora put into it, will 
dissolue. If co~mon water be poured into it, it goeth 
to the bottom: and likewise oyle. This writeth 
Albertus as some alledge. 
 
The taste of it excedeth all other tastes, and the 
smel all other smelles. Lullus, It comforteth the 
natural heat more then any other remeadye: it is 
most holsom for the stomake, the harte and the liuer: 
it norysheth blud, it agreeth meruelously and 
most with mans nature, it openeth and purgeth y=e= 
mouthes and entrances of the membres, vaines 
and poores of the body euery one, it auoydeth all 
obstructions and comforteth them. Yea it chaungeth 
the affections of the minde, it taketh awaye 
sadnes and pensiuenes, it maketh men meri, witty 
and encreaseth audacitie. Lullus. Anoynte the 
head therwith and it helpeth it of the head ache: it 
killeth the wormes drunken fasting: it putteth away 
sowning: it healeth the biles in the priuy me~bers, 
if they be washt therwith: it easeth them that 
be diseased in the stomacke, it stauncheth all runninges: 
it preserueth bodies from corruptinge by 
wormes: It auoydeth and kepeth a man fro~ gray 
heares. It is not permitted to women with child. 
It redresseth the fleame and reume of the hed. It 
encreaseth the ability of accompanying with wemen. 
It is good against thick hearing, poured into 
the eares. Mixt with wine and dro~k, it healeth 
the falling sicknes. If a man hold it longe, it taketh 
[^p.86^] 
away diuers kinde of touth ache. It putteth 
away the blemishes and whit spots in the eies, if 
it be poured into them: and auoydeth the running 
and watering of the same, if a man do but hold it 
in his mouth. It letteth the leprosy a space and hideth 
it It helpeth rotten and materinge biles, if 
linnen cloutes be dipt therin and laid vpon them. 
With a little decoction of parcely, it driueth away 
the stones in the bladder. It maketh wome~ apt to 
conceiue, but anoyeth them that be greate wyth 
childe. It cureth diuers greues, it is profitable to 
be laid vpon broken bones hot, with towe or with 
some plaster. It slaketh the cramp in the legs, if a 
man anoynt them therwith. He hath no name exprest 
that sheweth these qualities. But the most of 
them seme to be taken out of Lullus. 
 
I knew an old woman, that was cold and Cathectica, 
to be restored by a handkerchief made 
warm with Aqua vitæ set a fire within it. 
 
Some alledge the testimony of Constantine, of 
the vertues of burning water. 
 
Aqua vitæ besides other things is commodious 
and profitable for the strangury and other diseases 
of the bladder, for the tertian ague and quartain 
also which are ioyned wyth colde humors: against 
the disease called the Wulfe: againste wormes: 
againste the sens or painefull fealinge of a 
mannes bodye lyke vnto biles. It furthereth and 
prouoketh wemens floures. It breaketh and putteth 
awaye the stone in the reins, and expelleth a 
dead child without anye greate paine. The issues 
[^p.87^] 
of the bellye and fluxes, it helpeth, what so euer 
they be They say, that Aqua vitæ is perfite when 
of ten measures is made one, (whiche I suppose 
will come to passe in the thirde or fourthe destillacion). 
Annoynt the heade therewith, and it healeth 
wormes, the scuruinesse and scabbes, pusculs 
and skailes. It putteth awaye the spottes in the 
face and other wher. Broken egges or egges that 
that lacke a shell, put them in Aqua vitæ and it 
will sieth them. It healpeth the numnesse of a 
mannes sences called Apoplexia, swellings, fleames, 
tenesmum or desire to the stoole and wearynesse. 
It amendeth the morphew beinge drunken 
or annoynted theruppon. It maketh the skinne 
softe and pure. To conclude, it is good againste 
the bitinge of a mad dog. It will heale any wou~d 
excellentlye, if it be washte therewith, and so that 
no euill effect shall come therafter by the meanes 
of the same wound. 
 
I perceiuinge Aqua vitæ to be hotte and to dry, 
did sometime mixte with it honye, whereby it 
was bothe swieter to dryncke and gentler profitable 
for the colde stomacke, speciallye in wynter. 
Som mixt it with water made w=t= honye or rather 
with mede, called apomeli, which with vs co~monly 
they make of hony co~bs .&c. Som wet figs ther 
in & set them on fire, then eat them hot. And ma~ may 
also mixt any sirup therwith, one or other, according 
as y=e= disease shall requyre. To preserue wine 
y=t= it be not troubled nor putrified, put to it the te~th 
part of Aqua vitæ: in dede sulphur is far better for 
[^p.88^] 
the same purpose, but it bewrayeth the crafte and 
the smell there of. The same will alum do, but being 
bothe hurtfull, they are verye noysome to the 
health. Cardane. 
 
If wine by the meanes of the sauour of the vessels 
or taste of the grapes be corrupte and soured, 
poure Aqua vitæ into it and it will restore it. The 
same purgeth ha~ging wine that is new: also wine 
that is putrified and soured also: for it conuertes 
vineger. To conclude it bringeth a good smel and 
tast also to any wine be it neuer so euel or corrupt 
and good wine also it makes it better, Albertus as 
some alledge. When the wine is to be drawen into 
an empty vessel, most vse to put in a ball of brimston 
set a fyre: other vse Aqua vitæ, dipping towe 
therein. 
 
Wine that is made to haue anye taste or smell, 
out of hand in a momente, is both a curious thing 
for rich men cheiffy, which wil aduaunt them of y=e= 
sortes of wine: and also profitable. For the qualities 
of diuers remedies may be communicated by 
this meanes with the wine. Herbes, sedes, or spyces 
whatsoeuer they be, let them be poured into 
Aqua vitæ for the space of .xxiiii. houres for so the 
strength of them shalbe drawen out. Then y=e= waters 
so affected and died, shall be mixt with a lyttle 
wine when ye wil drink. Arnoldus de villa noua. 
 
Now that wine is made which they cal commo~ly 
Hippocras, with Aqua vitæ and certaine spices 
stiept therein, I will declare when I shall speake 
of wines. 
 
[^p.89^] 
Of the quintessens of wine I shall speake within, 
in the title of quintessens. 
 
[}Of such thinges as be destilled 
dry, put into any liquor.}] 
 
THe thinges that be dry can not be destilled, except 
they be stiept in some liquor. Of theis wil 
I write in this place. Of those that whiles they 
be new, be stiept and wet in some liquor befor thei 
be destilled, I wil speake hereafter amongst waters 
compoundes, in the beginning. Although the 
waters wherof we speake, here may be counted among 
the compoundes. Dry thinges therfor first 
let them be broken and grounde: then let them be 
stiept in some liquor, wine, vineger, rain water or 
of the wel spring, and those ether raw or destilled, 
(Vineger and wine are destilled for this purpose 
somtimes once, sometimes ofter) or in some other 
destilled liquor. They maye be stiepte also in the 
iuyce of soin herb or plant, and that likewise ether 
rawe, or els (that is better) destilled, Aqua vitæ 
rectified semeth to agre best to the stieping of spyces, 
except we wil auoyd to much heat, wherwith 
the thynges destilled in them myghte be infected 
withall, when the liquor is drawne awaye. 
 
Some still Cinnamon beaten with spring water 
poured to it, as we shall shewe amongste Oyles. 
Sedes also and other spices, wheroute oyle is taken, 
are stiept in some of the forsaid liquors. It is 
best according to my iudgement to destill all these 
thinges, dry thinges I meane infused and poured 
[^p.90^] 
into anything in ashes with a softe fire. Of waters 
of vertues or golden waters, that are wont 
to be made with saudge & other smelling herbes 
& spices, set in wine, I wil speke within amongst 
the co~pounded waters: & of them that are put in 
burning water, emongst the composed waters of 
life. It is to be considered also how long they sta~d 
to soke in wine: for new thinges, & they y=t= be thin 
or ope~ not massy, nede les time the~ dry, grosse and 
thick, & beaten things, the~ hole: the rotes then the 
sedes & spices: & they againe les then the herbs. 
Read befor whe~ we gaue rules of y=e= preparacion 
of things to be destilled. The co~mon custom is to 
destil the~ almost only dry, set in wine first a fewe 
daies, as spices & smelling herbes. But all other 
things also whose smel or tast what maner so euer 
it be wil haue kept in the liquor destilled, 
they are rightly destilled by soking in wine, as I 
taughte afore also, whereas I made mention of 
wormwod water, & of the preseruation of the vertues 
of remedies in y=e= waters destilled. And surely 
in those which when they are new & abound w=t= 
much moisture & therfore haue y=e= les smel, as gentian, 
astrantia, y=e= flour deluce, y=e= beries of iuniper & 
other: I wold more alow y=e= liquors of dri thinges 
set in wine or other wher: but if y=e= thinges be thin 
or slender, or of no sauor, or ought to coul and moiste~ 
they should be destilled rather new. Sometimes 
the time of the yeare causeth a man to take drye 
thinges because of the lacke or scarsity of fresh. 
 
Gentian water. Take .iiii. pounds of the fresh 
[^p.91^] 
and new rotes or rather dry cut in small peces, of 
great Gentian or white Gentian, (whose rotes 
are moste fat, and beinge set in wine, they nether 
corrupte them selues nor suffer the wine to corrupt, 
as I haue tried my self by the space of these 
ii yeres) set in a couple of great glasses in a stouf 
nie the fornace, or hang them if you wil, the glasses 
dilige~tly stopt, and put into them pure good 
wine, so much that the wine be .ii. fingers aboue 
the~: & you shal euer put new wine vnto them stil, 
til the rotes wil drinke no more, and so the wine 
being aboue it a two fingars, as I saide, let the 
glasses stand a moneth, and at length put the~ into 
.ii. cucurbitas, y=e= wine and the rotes destributed 
together, & destil them in Balneo Mariæ, or els in 
ashes with a soft fire. Of the water of Centory y=e= 
les and gentian together destilled in wine, reade 
within amongst composed waters. 
 
Iuniper beries also dry set in wine, geue a very 
good liquor & swiet smellinge: but wormwode 
(soked a few daies,) geueth a water very effectuall 
and most bitter, and the more if it be destilled 
in ashes, which both waies I haue tried. 
 
Pelitory other fresh or dry is set in wine or vineger 
destilled or vndestilled. 
 
These thynges also sookte in burnynge water 
(as I sayde) do communicate theyr strength 
wyth it: but I heare it is done muche moore 
effectuallye, if the thynges be beaten at the beginnynge 
and myxte wyth the lyes of wine redye 
to bee destylled (for of theese rather then 
[^p.92^] 
of wine, the men of our country draw Aqua vitæ.) 
So also did one teache me in counsell as a greate 
secreate, that Wormwode water and other maye 
be best made. I haue not tried it yet. 
 
Water of Roses wyth drye Roses is so made 
Pour water to dry Roses, not more the~ is sufficient 
to stiep them in: then put them from thence into 
glasen cucurbitas or leaden, and destill them by 
little and little. This water shall be profitable in 
medicins, and also to garnishing and trimming, 
or to the smel. Ther was a certain man put to one 
pound of dry Roses, ten pou~d of water and destilled 
Rose water indifferente good. But thys is not 
done saue when a man hathe not newe to make 
Rose water of .Bulcasis. If the Roses whyche we 
call commonly incarnation Roses, dried & moystned 
with the vapor of hot water be destilled, they 
wil geue good Rose water. Syluius. 
 
The water of the nux vomica or spueinge nut, 
or the iuice gotten out with fire, is like the water 
in colour, not in smel or tast: the chiefest remedy against 
poyso~, Cardanus in his second boke de subtilitate. 
And a little after. If the poyson newly taken 
remain yet in the stomake, the best kind of remedies 
be they that prouoke much to vomit stro~gly, 
milke, lie, oyle, the water of the spewing nut, I 
suppose he meaneth by the iuyce gotten out by the 
fire, nothinge els but the water destilled thereof. 
For he nameth water that is like it in colour, not 
in smel nor tast, which agreeth with destilled waters. 
But when as the spewing nut euery whit is 
[^p.93^] 
most hard and dry, it apeareth that his shel must 
be sookt in some liquor as water, wine, vineger, 
Aqua vitæ. I wold soke it rather in vineger, whiche 
by it self resisteth poysen, and is good to prouoke 
vomitting. 
 
Waters destilled of new and fresh pla~ts (saith 
Brunsvvick) ought to be preferred, whiche if they 
can not be had, ether for some other cause or because 
they be brought out of straunge countryes 
only dry, as spicknarde, lauander, stichæ, scoenantum, 
the hard time .&c. Thou shalt destill oute of 
them dry in this manner. In the month of May 
euery yere before the sunne rise, when it hath not 
rained the hole night, & the sky is fair, thou shalt 
gather dew out of som medow ful of diuers kind 
of herbes and flours, no watery ground nor wet, 
nor in a holow place, but rather vpon some hil, if 
it be possible. Thou maist gather it thus, draw a 
fair linnen cloth sprede abrode vpon the grasse, 
til it haue dronken much of the dew, then wryng 
it out into some vessell: and draw it again and fill 
it, euer wringing it out againe til thou haue gathred 
inough. This dew thou shalt destil thrise in 
Balneum Mariæ, and rectifye it also in the sunne, 
(that is in hot sand, for the space of: xl. daies) and 
kepe it a yere. The~ what time of the yere so euer 
thou lakst liquor of dry herbes, do thus. Take as 
many herbs as thou list dried in the shadow (the 
leaues being taken away and kepte apart by the~ 
selues) put them in a glasse, and pour vpon them 
thrise so much water of dewe: or at thre times, so 
[^p.94^] 
that first thou power on so much, that the herbes 
be sufficie~tly ouercouered with water: and againe 
twis so muche. Then set it in hors dung twoo or 
three daies, still it, and putrifie it againe, so that it 
be thrys putrified and destilled by course in order. 
This water surely shalbe muche better, then if a 
man, as Bulcasis wryteth, to one pound of dry roses 
(or other herbes or floures) shall put ten pou~d 
of common water and destill it by and by. A certaine 
cunning phisicion wryteth that if water bee 
destilled out of dry thinges after this forsaid maner, 
sooke in dew, not thrys only destilled, but nyn 
tymes, it shalbe better water then if it were made 
of freshe and newe thinges, whiche haue muche 
fleame in them. The same affirmeth that dew nyn 
times destilled doth drawe out the vertues out of 
the herbes that be put in it no les then aqua vitæ. 
Hitherto Brunsvvick. 
 
And in the dew it selfe also there is a certaine 
medicinall vertue as Brunsvvick techeth in an other 
place to be in the water therof destilled. In 
the falling sicknes, if thou make a cake of meale 
knod with nighterly dew of saint John, and bake 
it under the ashes, then giue it to the sicke to eate, 
thei say it wil make him hoal. Alexa~der Benedict~. 
 
[}Of quint essence of 
remedies.}] 
 
QVint essence they name to be, the chief and the 
heauenliest power or vertue in any plant, metall, 
beast, or in the partes therof, which by y=e= force 
[^p.95^] 
and puritie of the hoale subtaunce, not by any elimentall 
or sensible qualitie (although it be not 
without qualities) conserueth the good health of 
mans body, prolongeth a mans youthe, differeth 
age, and putteth away all maner of diseases. Of 
this first of al me~ writ Raimu~dus Lull~, although 
it wer vnknowen to al the physicians of his time, 
nether written of in any booke, nor tryed or gone 
aboute in any vse. After him foloweth besides other 
Iohannes de Rupe sciffa, (whome one certain 
man thinkes he flourished before Lullus, as I 
writ afore, I iudge they were both in one tyme) 
Hieronimus Brunsvvick, Philippus Vlstadius, and 
perauenture a few other whiche writ sumwhat of 
the same. Sum kind therof is simple, as y=t= moste 
famous quint essence of wyne or Aqua vitæ, of chelidony 
or selandyn, of mans bloud, of strawberys, 
of Antimonii. &c. Other ar co~pounde that is whe~ 
certain remedies ar put to sum quint essence now 
perfited, y=t= it may draw out y=e= vertues of the~, wherunto 
gold y=t= may be drunken, ought to be assribed. 
 
But here springeth a doute, saith Cardane, whether 
a man may make y=e= water te~perat, which thei 
cal quint essence: It wilbe, as I shal proue, of the 
nature of the firmame~t, that is a most pure & thin 
substance moueable, & which by the mouing reteineth 
a temperat heat, & very muche therof. This 
thefor is of power to co~serue al strengths, & to prolong 
life. For being most subtil, it mixith it self w=t= 
the first moistur, pearcing the massy thinges, & separateth 
the excreme~ts, which be co~teined therin. 
[^p.96^] 
And because it hath much heat, it expelleth what 
soeuer is vncleane, and therfore restoreth the natural 
heat. For age is nothinge els then a lessening 
and diminishing of natural heat, which is 
therfore diminished, because the mouinge is hindred: 
as I saide of fire: for there is like reason of 
this vnto that. Mouing is hindred, because of y=e= 
aboundance of earthy matter, because the earthe 
only hath very muche matter, and is destitute of 
all mouing. Therfore that water being of so te~perate 
a heate, it shall nether vexe the hearte, nor 
noysom to the liuer: wherfore this onlye can perform 
the things that we haue spoken. When burning 
water therfore or Aqua vitæ reteininge hys 
purity and subtil matter: by the longe mocyon of 
circulacio~, hath put of and rid away his heat and 
sharpnes of taste and smell, it is becomed of the 
nature of the firmament: and then firste of all it 
smelleth swiet and fragantly. For a fragra~t smel 
is nothing els then a sharp smell when it is moderate. 
Example of peper, whiche hathe no fragrante 
smell .&c. Therefore Aqua vitæ, if it come 
once to a temperatues, the thinnes and purity remaining 
stil, it must nedes be made fragra~t and 
swiet smelling: and if it be once fragrant, it must 
necessarilye be turned into the nature of the fyrmament. 
There is also a water made of the flesh 
tyr~ or an adder, that restoreth youthe: there is 
made olso of Elleborus, which I sawe at my fathers. 
But these vexe and vnquiet the body, and 
make disceitful image and like lines of youth: the 
[^p.97^] 
firmamentall water dothe it in dede, whiche reteineth 
long that which a man hathe and adourneth 
the same. But is the firmament more pure 
then the fire which is moste hot? It is surelye so: 
for it is next vnto the heauen, and therfore most 
lighte. For by his circulacion it moderateth the 
heat caused in it by the starres: and after y=e= same 
manner thys water, broughte to the moste puritye 
by the heat of the fire, by mocion it self is coled 
again and obteineth a temper. Wherefore bothe 
this and the firmamente are as it were in a 
meane betwene mortal thinges and immortall. 
For hauing a place and temper, and also substa~ce 
next vnto the heauen, it can not be corrupte. But 
whiles it is constreined and driuen beneath, it is 
couled, and so after a lo~g time it is corrupt. Therfore 
it is in a meane betwixt mortal and immortal 
(of which kind the Stoikes beleue mans soule 
to be.) Al this write Cardane. 
 
The vertue of euery thing resteth in the quintessens 
therof, hot, cold, moyst, and dry .&c., and the 
same operacion it hath, which it had afore in his 
mixture or with his mater, but much more swiftly, 
& more merueilouslye manye waies. After the 
destillacion vpon the lies certain times repeated, 
letting the water haue euer a new digestio~, euery 
water ought alwaies to be circulated so longe in 
hors do~g or other wher, vntil it haue a most swit 
sauor. For such a fragrancy is required in euery 
quintessens. Somthings it is sufficie~t to destil the~ 
once or twise, and then circulate them & after a 
[^p.98^] 
few daies, if any part of the earth or lies remain 
in the boto~ of the circulating vessel, to put it awai 
pouring it forth. The quintessens of wine wyll no 
more burn the mouth, nether is it burning wine 
any more, but more subtill, and is called heauen: 
wherunto we say his starres is added, when as 
herbes of diuers qualities, and such as be excellent 
againste diuers sicknesses, are sokte & stiept 
therin, as we shall shewe hereafter in Aqua vitæ 
compounded. To be solificate or made golde~, is 
when we procure the vertue of the sunne, that is, 
gold to be in it, as it is declared before, in the tretise 
of potable gold or gold that may be drounke. 
These thinges for the most part are out of Lullus 
boke of quintessens. 
 
The quintessens of any medicine hathe a thousand 
times the greater vertue, then it had before, 
whiles the thing had yet the element in it. Vlsta. 
 
[}Hovv the quintessens of all things 
may be drawn out, to minister them or the 
vertue of them, to mennes bodies: oute of the 
first boke of Lullus, intreatinge of 
quintessene.}] 
 
THe quintessence of any thinge may be drawne 
out from it, as of wode, frutes, floures, rotes, 
leaues, sedes, stones, metals, fleshe, and of what 
spices a man will, in this sort. 
 
Anye thinge that you wil separate the quintessence 
from, you shall put it into the quintessence of 
wine (pure and perfect as is said before) and you 
[^p.99^] 
shal set it forth to be solified & sonned in y=e= spring, 
or els in a vessel to a lighte fire, and within three 
houres you shall haue the quintessence of y=e= thing 
mixt with the quintessence of the wine, which shal 
be conuerted into such a nature as is of y=e= thinge 
that is put in, whether it be hot or cold, moyst or 
dry, purge or what other condicio~ or smel so euer 
it be of: and it shal not only haue the same operacion, 
but also in the same degre, y=t= is nether more 
nor les .&c. After this he reherseth remedies one 
by one which are hot in the first degre, then in the 
seco~d, third & fourth: & likewise he maketh tables 
of cold, moist & dry things. Then he teacheth generally 
of y=e= degrees of remedies & of y=e= art of mixting 
the same. Last of all he addeth also tables & 
rehersals according to y=e= second qualities, as thei 
term the~ all which we let passe, because we write 
vnto the learned & phisicions, nether is it conuenient 
to confound the partes of sciences one with 
an other. Then in y=e= seco~d boke for euery disease 
(those only that be most greuous and counted co~monly 
almost vncurable) he teacheth what remedies 
or medicins ought to be mixt with the quintessens. 
Rogerius Bacho also writ a little booke of 
the qualities & strengthes of Aqua vitæ, throughout 
the .xii. signes according to the diseases from 
the head to the fete, adding waters and medicins 
according to the nature of euery part and disease, 
for one, one, for an other, an other. Thys booke 
some ascribe to Arnold de villa noua. 
 
Ihon Brasescus a man of our age moste exercysed 
[^p.100^] 
in the misteries of the Arte of liquors, as hys 
writinges do testify, in a certain dialoge, the spekers 
wherof be Raymund Lullus and Demogorgon, 
(which y=e= author set forth in Italian, with an 
other also vpon the exposicion of the bokes of Geber. 
Ihon Petreius at Norinberg Prynted them 
both in Latin withoute the authors name) affirminge 
that quintessens whyche serueth for the 
conseruing and lengthening of mannes life, is 
not to be lokt for out of plants, beastes or precyous 
stones, but of only metals: he wryteth thus. 
Raymund. Seing it is necessarye that this medicine 
should be vtterly vncorruptible, and in thys 
thinge it ought to passe and excede al things that 
haue any part of the elementes in them: it muste 
nedes be drawn out of such a matter as is moste 
far from all corrupcion, and leaste subiecte to the 
same. Demogorgo~. Yet thou saidst in y=e= boke whiche 
thou writst of the secrets of nature, y=t= it shuld 
be drawn out of red wine, y=e= same co~firmeth Iohn 
de rupa scissa, other suppose it shuld be made of Celedonie, 
other wold take mans blud. Ray Thou 
art not a litle deceiued, if thou think y=e= writinges 
of philosophers ought to be taken & vndersta~ded 
according to y=e= bare letter, chiefly in this science, y=e= 
more clearly & plainly thei speke, so much y=e= more 
darknes haue their writings, for thei haue spoke~ 
by similitudes & ridles in y=e= darkest form of spech. 
Demo. In this thing what similitude haue they 
vsed. Ray. Senior the philosopher saith this medicine 
is tourned and altered from coloure to coloure, 
[^p.101^] 
and from taste to taste, and from nature to 
nature: and therfore the names therof are multiplied. 
Also Minois a philosopher, if a man aske 
(saieth he) why is it made rede before it receiued 
whyt: Answer, that it was twys made blacke, 
twys turnid into orrenge colour, and receiued 
twys red coloure. Seing nowe that it receiueth 
twys red coloure, as red wyne and mans bloud, 
that is to say, after the putrifaction and in the destillation: 
therefore the old menne speakinge by 
similitudes called it red wyne, mans bloud, & dragons 
bloud, and suche lyke, &c. A little after also 
he putteth those signes and tokens of quintessence 
now perfit, whiche Io. De Rupescissa doth: that is, 
that al men entring into the haus may be marueilously 
allured vnto it set in a corner of the hous: & 
an other that all birdes that perceiue that swietnes 
of sauoure, may flocke together vnto it set in 
the top of a toure: this is expounded allegorically, 
that by the toure, the fornace set in a corner of the 
hous, may be vnderstanded, in the whiche fornace 
a glas co~teining the matter to be decocted is put: 
by them that enter in to this hous, and by the byrdes 
y=t= fly vnto it, maye be signified those spirites 
and vapoures whiche by the vertue of heat are caried 
vpwarde and ascende alost by the neck of the 
vessell or box: whiche when they are fastened and 
ascende no more, it is a token (saith he) that their 
watery moysture is now finished and the matter 
swietened, and the medicine ended. And in this 
opinion Rasis also was. Thus saith he. 
 
[^p.102^] 
[}Of the dravvyng out of the quint 
essence from wyne, out of Vlstadius 
and Raymund Lullus.}] 
 
THou shalt take the best wyne thou canst get, 
what colour soeuer it be, let it be wyny rather 
then swiet, destill it .iiii. tymes in a lembeck, so as 
commonly burning water is made. If so be it, it 
be ofter destilled, it shalbe the better. To knowe 
when it is sufficiently destilled, you shal consider, 
if it be set on fire in any vessell (of syluer or tyn) it 
will consume hoally, so that no moysture remain 
in the vessell. When it is therfor prepared in this 
wyse, let it be put into a pellicane, that is a vessell 
with eares or handles on ether 
syde one, whiche also some call 
the vessell of Mercurius, by the 
hoal wherof in the top, the matter 
that is to be circulated, may 
be put in and out. [^An image of the Pelican distillilation apparatus omitted.^] And when the 
vessell is diligently claied, and 
cemented with stif claye, by the 
often going vp and downe, the 
water shalbee turned into true 
quint essence. Then the wyne so destilled as we 
haue said, whan as it hath all the foure eleme~ts, 
yet by the oft mouing agitacion and going vp and 
downe, it passeth and is turned from corruptible 
into almost vncorruptible. If so be it that by the 
often ascention and descention of destillation, the 
grosse from the subtill, the unpure from the pure 
[^p.103^] 
is separated, how muche more doth it come to pas 
in a still where it is tossed vp & downe a thousand 
thousand times. By this mouing therfore, it is to 
be supposed, that an elementall matier is turned 
in to a substance voyd of all elementes and a body 
incorruptible, so that this quint assence is of so muche 
the further from the corruption of a body that 
hath parte of the elementes in it, as the heauen it 
selfe is more vncorruptible the~ the foure eleme~ts. 
But when this circulation is many times done, 
at length let the hoal that is in the top be opened: 
wheras you shal know by the moste precious and 
swiet smell, whether any part of the .iiii. elements 
remain, not conuerted yet in to quint essence. For 
if it be perfitly done, there will issue forth a moste 
fragrant and pleasant smell, so excellent that they 
that fele it, shal thinke them selue to be rapt from 
the earth into heauen, and to haue the fruicion of 
a certain heauenly sauoure. This vapour if it 
chaunce to insinuate it selfe into some close place 
of the hous, it shall so fill the hous full, that thou 
shalt thinke thou neuer feltest any thinge more 
swete, more plesaunt or better smelling, a marueilous 
thing to be spoken and almoste incredible. 
If it be set in the top of a toure, it will allure all 
kynde of byrdes vnto it, that be there aboute. But 
if that excellent grace of sauoure appeare not yet, 
then thou shalt shytte it close againe in to the Pelecane, 
& when it is dilige~tly clayed, set it in again 
to the circulating destillation, vntill the perfit 
quint essence it selfe appeare, or els as Raymundus 
[^p.104^] 
in his first boke the second chapter, calles it quick 
Mercury. And it hath not only that moste excellent 
sauour and tast, but also a certain vncorruptible 
nature to be occupied aboute other medicines. 
And surely it hath no brentnes in the mouth as 
aqua vitæ, nether any moysture or fleame, bycause 
all the earthy & elementall matter is settled down 
to the bottome. 
 
[}Hovv qvint essence may be dravven 
out more easely and with les cost, for 
poore mens sakes, out of the same.}] 
 
[^An image of the distillation apparatus omitted. The index letters A, B and C refer to the figure.^] 
PUtt Horsse 
dung A in 
great & deepe 
vessell B 
or in a pitte made for 
this purpose: and in 
midst of the dunge set 
the still, C full vntill 
two third parts of the 
matter to be destilled, 
so that the third parte 
remaine withoute the 
dung empty, that the 
matter may ascende & 
descende, and so to bee 
turned into cleare water. But the dung must be 
renued once at the least euery wieke. The same 
may be done in the drose of vynes that remaine 
[^p.105^] 
after they be prest in the wine haruest: or els in 
the dog daies with the sunne. It is possible also 
to draw quintessens out of troubled, vnclean and 
corrupte wine, if it be not sower or like Uineger: 
For we see euen of corrupt wine, if it grewe in a 
good place, althoughe it be troubled and of an ill 
taste, yet verye good Aqua vitæ maye be destylled 
therout. 
 
There is also an other waye to drawe it oute 
without fire and labor. Take Aqua vitæ the best 
you can finde: put it in a glasse 
with a longe necke, in the toppe 
wherof must be a hole, whyche 
oughte to be closed and stopped 
with waxe prepared accordingly 
(as Vlstadius techeth after in 
the te~th chapter.) [^An image of the long-necked vessel omitted.^] Then let it be 
turned vpside downe, and with 
the neck let it be put into the dung, so the grosser 
matter shall settle and lie in the bottome of the 
still, whiche when it shall be a longe time buryed 
in the dung, at length shalbe drawn out by it ge~tlely, 
in the form, as it is put in. Then shalt thou 
see the separacion of the pure from the impure, & 
the subtil from the grosse: For all the groser matter 
shalbe about the necke of the glasse. Therfore 
with a fine pen knife, and a sharp, thou shalt bore 
through the wax vnto the water, & when the pen 
knife is drawne out, the grosser matter shall run 
out which was setled in the necke. When thys is 
cleane run oute vnto the subtil and pure matter, 
[^p.106^] 
that is, the very quintessente, stop the hoole wyth 
thy finger & turn the glas vpright. So hast thou 
quintessence, but les precious then thother afore. 
In like manner may burninge water be put in a 
glasen vessell, not turned, but buried vprighte in 
dunge for a certaine space. After by streinynge 
may you separate the groser mater which is setled 
to the bottome, from the pure that is aboue: 
but this is yet les precyus. Notwithstanding it 
draweth out all the vertues of the herbes, and other 
matters, wherefore it is not to be set lighte 
by. There maye also other wayes be inuented, 
but I commende wyth all my harte, vnto al men 
the firste waye, as the best and most excellent: it 
is no great labour and light cost, nether shal you 
repent your self ether of the one or of thother: for 
you shall finde a treasure wyth a greate gaine. 
These writes Vlstadius the .viii. chap. 
 
After thys he addeth the waye howe to drawe 
oute quintessence oute of newe wine, yet hot in the 
vessell in haruest, whiche is done wythoute anye 
harme to the wine, whiche for shortnes sake, and 
because it is not touched of other authors (as far 
as I know) except perauenture of Lullus) I wil 
let it passe.

cause, or by the heat of the sunne. It vtterly stau~cheth 
and putteth awaye cleane the Canker. To 
conclude, it hath manye and great vertues: for it 
is medicinable in hot causes, as Aqua vitæ in cold 
[^p.109^] 
Wherfore the vse therof is good in all agues as 
well hoat as burning agues: in all hoat diseases, 
and grieues of the eyen and head, that co~meth of 
heat: also againste the irkesumnes and lothsumnes 
of the stomack: for the diseases called Lupus, 
and the fistula, and the pain of the syde, & the heat 
of the priuy members through the act of generation, 
and all diseases aboute thies priuy partes, 
what hot causes so euer thei cum of. And after the 
deliueraunce of wemen, it is very proffitable if a 
cloth be dipt in it and laid vpon the wombe or mother, 
(the preuy place) and vpon the place where 
the grief is, if the grief be outward: if it be inward 
then take some of it and mynister it by the way of 
a glister. If ther be any fault in the stomack, take 
of it morning and euening half an egge shell full: 
If a mans yard be sore within, let therof be conueied 
in by a pype for that purpose. Against the 
obstructions and stoppinges of the liuer & splene 
and other diseases of hoat causes, wette a linnen 
cloth therin and lay it to the diseased syde thrys a 
day: for it purgeth the bloud very greatly, but you 
must take good hede that the cloth that is moystened 
therwith roole not vpon the stomack, nor cum 
nye it. 
 
A certain water in Raymund Lullus booke of 
waters, semeth to be of the lyke operation, which 
he describeth in this wyse. A water compounded 
accordinge to the contrary of Aqua vitæ: Take 
whyte Camphora, roses, whyt pople and blacke, 
lettis, cichory, porsulane, violets, Solanu~ or night 
[^p.110^] 
shade, maidenhear, cymbalaris, singrene, vermicularis, 
rostrum porcinum, cardicellum. The leaues 
that be to be punned, let them be punned and destilled. 
 
[}Of the extracting and dravvyng 
forth of all the vertues of Chelidonia or 
selandine: by the whiche example, euery 
man of any vnderstanding, may 
vse to drawe out the vertues 
also of other planetes.}] 
 
BY the quint essence of selandin, Ioan. 
Brasescus thinkes sumwhat els to 
be allegorically vndersta~ded, as I 
declared before wher we entreated 
of quint essence generally. 
 
Chelidonia, Sela~din (saith Vlst.) 
hath innumerable vertues: and the quint essence 
therof, which we wil teache here to get out, goeth 
to the making of potable gold or gold that may be 
drunck. Selandine when it is moste rype, take it 
with the herbe, routes and floures, cut it small & 
beate it in a morter, then put it in a cucurbitam or 
body of a still of earth glased: when the body is ful 
shit it close, and clay it round aboute, then set it in 
now hors dung, for the space of iii. weekes. After 
put it in a limbeck and destill it in Balneo Mariæ, 
with a slow fyre, and the fleame shall auoyde out 
of it. Then shall you drawe out the dregges, and 
when they are very fine ground vpon a marble 
[^p.111^] 
stone, put the~ again in a cucurbita with a blynde 
lymbeck, and let them stand in Balneo Mariæ a seuennight, 
or in hors dung mo daies. Afterwarde 
the matter by litle and litle being couled put on a 
nosed limbeck, and destill it in ashes, according as 
in the .x. chap. of the separation of oyle from the 
earth, we haue spoken: and there shall issue oute a 
clear water conteining in it selfe aire and water. 
Thou shalt separate the water from the aire in a 
new cucurbita by Balneo Mariæ, with an easy fire: 
for the fleam shall ascende and the oyle remayne, 
whiche thou shalt reserue and kepe. Then shalt 
thou grynde the dregges agayne vpon a marble 
stone, and power .iiii. partes of the fleam to one of 
the dregges, mixt them, and incorporate the~, and 
let them stande in Balneo Mariæ seuen days at the 
last thou halt destill the~ in sand with a great fire, 
and the fleame shall issue oute first, then a radishe 
water, or rather an oyle, whiche is the element of 
fyre, from the whiche thou shalte separate the 
fleame in Balneo Mariæ, as is before sayde. But 
the dregges that left, whiche conteyne nothinge 
els but earth, must bee vrged with a stronge fyre 
and brought vnto lyme, by the space of ten daies. 
(that is in a fornace of calcination or reuerberation, 
or a very lyme kiln, as I haue taught in the 
tenth chap.) Then grynd them again vpon a marble 
stoone and sooke them in the fleame, and lette 
them be destilled in a limbeck, vntill you see in the 
matter lyttle whyte stoones lyke salt. And 
this salt must againe bee dissolued with water, 
[^p.112^] 
out of whiche you haue destilled it, and after, you 
shall destill it again, and againe so ofte, vntill the 
earth chaunce and put away from it all vncleane 
and earthy colour, & be brought to a very whyte 
(to the whytnes of wax) and so it shalbe rectified 
earth. The other elementes also ought to be rectified, 
so that euerye one bee destilled seuen tymes, 
powring euery time the fleam to the aire and fier, 
and after separating them as is afore said. When 
as thou wilt do this an easier way, dissolue euery 
eleme~t with his own water by equall portio~s, &c. 
whiche I let pas, bycause they are declared sumwhat 
obscurely. There is also an other way more 
subtill, to reduce euery element to his perfection 
or quintessence, but it must be presupposed that euery 
element be first iustified. Then let it be put 
in a vessel of circulation in hors dung or in Balneo 
Mariæ .xxx. daies, and then destill it againe. So 
shall the very body as a gros matter be chaunged 
into spirite or moste subtill and pure substance. 
Sum do it with more ease, taking foure partes 
of earth, and one part of one of the foure elements 
whiche a man wil, and by digesting, after the forsaid 
maner, and circulating .xxx. daies, they dooe 
chaunge any element into quintessence. The matter 
is iudged to be sufficie~tly circulated, whan the 
quintessence swimmeth aboue the other matter. 
 
Of the vertues of euery one of the liquors of 
Selandine. The element of the water is good for al 
the diseases of the body, both hoat & cold. It tempereth 
also al the veines about the hart, and driueth 
[^p.113^] 
all venom from the hart: it cureth al the diseases 
that chaunce vnto the lunges. It purgeth 
the bloud, and preserueth a man from all corruption 
of the natural strength and power. At once, 
it is good for all sicke men in what disease so euer 
they be. 
 
The element of air, like vnto oyle, confirmeth 
and encreaseth the strength and beauty of yong 
persons, if they vse it sometimes with meate, for 
it letteth the bloud fro~ corrupting by any menes. 
It burneth vp, consumeth and expelleth all salte 
fleame: it taketh away melancholy and all brentnesse 
of cholor. 
 
The eleme~t of fire, if so much as a wheat corn 
in quantity be mixt with the best wine ye can get 
and poured into a sick mans mouthe, yea if he be 
half dead, it restoreth and refresheth al the stre~gthes 
of the body: for it perceth vnto the hart, and 
maketh it warme: and expelleth all poysons and 
moist superfluities from the hart. Lullus with the 
quint essence of wine mixeth a little drop of thys 
oyle, to restore the~ that are about to die, and past 
al hope, in that within the .xx. part of an hour. 
 
Som draw out the quint essence fro~ Selandine 
an other way and shorter. They cut Selandine together 
with the rote and flour in smal peces they 
wey it, & pouring wel water vpon it, they sethe it 
til it be brought to the same weighte Then they 
pun it in a stone morter, and when the iuyce is 
streined out through a linnen clothe and purged 
from the dregges, they decoct and sieth the rest til 
[^p.114^] 
it be ad consistenciam mellis as thick as hony. After, 
they put it in a cucurbita so that it be half full, 
& by destillacion in Balneo Mariæ, they gather y=e= 
water or fleme. Then translating the vessel into 
ashes, they receiue the aiery oyl, wherupon when 
they se an other kind of oyl swim aboue (the fyre 
being encresed) they set vnder an other receiuing 
vessel, wherin the element of fire is gathered. Euery 
one of these liquors must be rectified, that it 
may be mete for the medicins of mans bodi, that 
is, by the repetinge the destillacion .vii. times: of 
the water or fleme in Balneo Mariæ, so y=t= at euery 
time the cucurbita be diligentlye washed, (made 
cleane) from the dregges which remaine, whiche 
ought to be mixt w=t= the element of thearth, which 
remaineth in the bottome of the cucurbita after y=e= 
destillation of y=e= fiery liquor. Likewise thou shalt 
rectify thair, destilling it in ashes .vii. tunes, mixting 
the dregs with thearth. Afterward y=e= liquor 
of fire likewise. The earthy matter, in such maner 
as is said afore in the other fashion. To these 
thinges thus dressed, they attribute y=e= same vertues 
y=t= we rehersed afore, to euerye one of them: 
which it nedeth not to repete: onlye those thinges 
wherin they differ, we wil rehers. The waterye 
liquor of Selandine putteth away al heats & poisons 
out of y=e= brest. It is good for the stoppinges 
of the liuer and lunges: for it consumeth y=e= superfluous 
humors & fleme: Ty co~clude, it deliuereth 
a ma~ within the space of .ix. daies, free fro~ all infirmities. 
The aierye liquor suffereth no blacke 
[^p.115^] 
choler, no bitter, nor fleme in y=e= body to get y=e= moisture. 
It encreseth blud, & destributeth it into all 
the partes of the body by his pearcing. Wherfore 
they that vse this oyle, do let blud the ofter. If a 
ma~ be in ieoperdy of losing of an eie, let him drop 
in a drop or .ii. therof euerye daye by the space of 
xxx. dais, & it shal do him merueilus much good. 
The firye liquor is muche more effectuous then 
the watry or aiery, & helpeth where they fayle. It 
conserueth the youthe, it maketh age liuelye and 
youthful, it refresheth y=e= hart, & being receiued w=t= 
water of a kind of whete, it is saide to be elipir of 
life. Moreouer y=e= earthy matter rectified by dissolucio~s, 
coagulations & ielyings: calinatio~s & subtil 
salt of y=e= erth, wherwith al metals may be turned 
into stone, & al spirits may be fixed: hauynge 
radicable & naturall moisture. It norisheth lepre 
me~. Of this y=e= auncie~t philosophers made a stone 
which they called y=e= philosophers stone. The maner 
to receiue y=e= forsaid liquors within the bodi is 
thus. Three drops of y=e= fire of Sela~dine, iii. sponeful 
of rosewater, put to it a litle sponeful of y=e= sanguin 
air (y=t= is the liquor of the air) & geue it to be 
drunken fasting, if the disease be hot, with wine: 
and if the man be past .xxiiii. yeres of age geue it 
him w=t= Aqua vite. In hot agues it ought not to be 
taken in no wise. Al this writeth Vlstadius.
