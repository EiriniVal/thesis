[}THE 
WARMING STONE. 
 
Excellent Helps really found out, tried, and 
had, by a Warming Stone in his Case, which not costing 
much, will save much cost in fire, and withall avoyd the 
danger of fire: And likewise is very usefull and comfortable 
for the colds of aged and sicke people, and for 
Women with child, and in Child-bed: 
 
As also for Fluxes, Rheumes, Colicks, Ruptures, 
or any cold disease: And for those that in Beds, Studies, 
Shops, Ships, Churches, or elsewhere, have need 
of heate, yet cannot conveniently make 
use of Fire: 
 
And likewise for the Poore, when having no fire of 
their owne, they may borrow the heating of this stone at a 
Neighbours fire, if his Charity be not altogether cold. 
 
These Stones with their Cases are to be sold at 
 
where more particular satisfaction may be 
had of the Contents of the Booke.

[}The Warming Stone.}] 
 
THe decay of natural heat in aged persons and in many 
others, sicknesse, ill accidents, and their continuall 
sitting, makes them to need the helps of Artificiall 
warmth; and my selfe through the blessing of God have therby 
often received ease of my griefes, and I verily beleeve the 
preservation of my life in many grievous extremities. Once 
(I remember) when I was dangerously oppressed with often 
and very strong vomiting, and did rise out of my bed and 
go into the cold so many times, and so speedily one after another, 
that I could neither give heate to my bed, nor receive 
any from it: Another time also when by a hurt in my foot my 
griefe was so exceedingly encreased, that both my foot & leg 
were grown full of blacke spots, and white between, from the 
sole of the foot to the knee, and most which saw it tooke it to 
be a Gangrene, which they thought to be uncurable without 
cutting off my leg, which also was so mortified with cold that 
I could give it no heate from my body; I then by the blessing 
of God (as I have many other times done) maintained heat in 
it by the help of a kinde of stone, which I find to be apt to receive 
heate much sooner, and likewise to retain it much longer 
than any other thing which I could finde upon any reason 
or triall. For I found cloaths heated by the fire would quickly 
lose their warmth, and likewise boords could not retaine 
their heate long, and that bricke and streetstone required much 
time to heat them, and held it but a little while; & that other 
stones were not able to endure stong heating, but would suddenly 
fly in pieces; whereas this stone being well seasoned at 
the first with a moderat heat, will both receive it quickly, and 
keep it very long, and impart it very kindly and agreeable unto 
nature. When my feet have bin cold, warming the same stone 
[^p.2^] 
by the fire, and putting the soles of my feet thereon, it hath 
in one quarter of an houre recovered me more heat unto them, 
then scorching them by a violent fire, could have done in an 
whole houre; When I have beene likewise grievously pained 
and tortured with the Colicke, and winde in my Guts, the 
strength of the heate of this stone hath (by applying it unto 
my belly) suddenly eased and cured me. My Wife being 
delivered of our eldest childe, I came to visite her, to know 
how shee did after that great danger; shee told me that 
shee was laid on a Trundle-bed to make her sweat, after 
her weakning with paine and travell in childbirth; but 
the bed being somewhat too short for her (shee being 
tall of person) and her feete reaching beyond the frame 
of the bed, shee could get no sufficient heat unto them 
to procure sweat; which as soone as I heard, I promised I 
would make her a medicine for it quickly, and did so, by 
warming a stone, which did bring her to so kindly a 
sweate, as that shee recovered the danger of that Child-birth, 
and by the Blessing of God brought me many more 
Children afterwards. This Warming Stone also hath 
holpen a Woman great with Child, who had a great ache 
in her thigh, and thought she could not be cured, till shee 
were freed of her burthen by Childbirth, yet by the helpe 
of the warmth of this Stone, found perfect remedy above 
two months before the time of her delivery came: And as it 
is a thing certainly knowne, that the least cold in Childbed, 
(which cannot be recovered by the sole strength of their then 
weakened naturall heat) brings certain death; so I know no other 
remedy so likely to recover heate, sweate and strength in 
any such accident, as by the helpe of these warming Stones, 
in their cases, either one or more of them (as need shall 
require) being applyed unto any part of the Body that 
wants it. This hath beene tryed by a woman whose strength 
failing her to free the after burthen; those which were about 
her not knowing what other helpe to give her, they 
[^p.3^] 
applyed this warming Stone, and by the helpe of the heate 
thereof, and the Blessing of God, nature wrought so well, 
that within one houre, shee escaped that danger and recovered 
her health and strength againe. Another also who was 
growne so pale and cold after long travell, that the midwife 
who was sent for to helpe her, finding and feeling her 
feete and her face to bee cold, supposed shee had beene dead, 
and said unto those who had sent for her, she marvelled why 
they had sent for her, to come to a dead body: they answered 
her she was not dead, though very weake: whereupon rubbing 
her face, and finding some warmth therein, shee caused 
them presently to send to her house with all speed for a Couple 
of these warming Stones, by the help of the heat whereof 
applyed to her feet and her Belly, God blessed her indeavors 
so well, that both the woman and the child were preserved. 
 
One of my Neighbours also, who had been long weake and 
sickly, and newly had her old griefe and weaknesse much increased 
by the losse of her eldest sonne, when with all the help 
that she could get by Physicke, in a long night she could 
take little rest; by the warmth of these Stones (the one being 
applied to her feet, and the other to the bottome of her belly) 
shee found more ease and sounder sleepe, then she could doe 
at any time in a quarter of a year before: And she told me that 
when her maid had forgotten (after an eight or ten dayes using 
thereof) to provide this help for her, she slept as ill, as she 
was wont to doe before; but now (God be praised) is very well 
amended both in health and in strength: The same party also being 
so extreamly weakned, with such a greivous paine in her 
back as she was neither able to goe nor stand, and told her husband, 
that if it should continue with her but three dayes, she 
thought verely it would cost her life, by applying these warming 
stones to the place grieved, within 3 houres was able to 
walke about her chamber; at which her husband told me hee 
wondred exceedingly, how so great an alteration could bee 
wrought in so short a time. 
 
[^p.4^] 
The help hereof also hath recovered those who were so indangered 
by taking cold in their ruptures, that both themselves & 
their friends dispaired of their lives, because the fat of their 
guts being fallen down into their cods, and there grown hard 
& stiffe by the cold, could not possibly be replaced, till strong 
heate had resolved it into softnesse againe: and so there was 
means found to returne them into their due place; by which 
(God be praised) some who desired to be praied for publikely 
in the church, being out of hope of life, have recovered health 
and strength again, though one of them was neer threescore & 
ten when by this means he was holpen. It hath likewise done 
exceeding much good to many that have had very violent fluxes 
(whereof some of them have bin bloudy) who by the help 
of these stones applied to their belly and their hinder parts 
both at one time, and the help of heating their drinke by the 
fire as hot as they could take it, have recovered. The same remedy 
likewise helpes much to abate the violent cold fits of 
agues, & being applied to the stomack, strengthens the weaknes 
thereof very much, against the cough or any disease which 
comes of a cold cause: for it exceedingly helpes the weaknes 
of the stomacke, because all good digestion being made by 
heate, as extream outward colds weaken it by abating that 
heat, so this outward heate strengthneth it much by adding 
more warmth unto it: as we find, that boyled, baked, or rosted 
meat being eaten hot, that heat helps us much to concoct the 
same meat. And wheras we seek help by artificial liquors that 
have an extraordinary heat, to help the cold weaknes of nature 
by their strength, if too little bee taken it doth little good, if 
too much, much harme; wheras the heate of these stones may 
be duly tempered to our use, being continued, encreased, abated, 
or removed suddenly, as the diseased party shall think fit. 
The same stones also put into the bed, do not onely supply the 
need of a warming pan, but being put into a case lined two fingers 
thick every where, with wooll between, frise on the outside, 
and canvas on the inside, will retain a comfortable heate 
[^p.5^] 
in the bed for ten houres together, and a sencible heate for 
fourteen, if it be throughly warmed; which must be done as 
hot as may be, without burning the case, which is tried by 
spitting on the stone, or sprinkling water on it, for if it hisse 
not it is never too hot. I make the case of canvas on the inside, 
because it is not so apt to burne as woollen cloath; and have 
wooll between, because it sorts better with any part of the body 
than cloath doth, and by reason of the thicknesse thereof 
brings not an over-violent heate in the beginning, yet continues 
it much longer than cloath or linnen could doe: and the 
frise on the outside is softer and warmer than other stuffe. And 
a stone in a case thus made, may be applied to the head, feet, 
belly, or any other part of the body that hath need of it, and 
may be as soon put away if the heat be too great. 
 
It is also exceeding usefull for all schollars to heate their 
hands and feet, when they must attend their studies in cold 
weather. And for al persons which by their trades in such seasons 
must keep their shops, or for the service of God continue 
in the Church. And such as travel by Sea, who may have these 
stones warmed by the fire, though they cannot warme themselves 
in that place where the fire is. The small cost which 
belongs to it is mostly in providing the stone and case at first; 
for the stone will be heated by the same fire which is made for 
any other purpose, either to bake, boile, brew, or rost, or by any 
other fire, either layd upon it, or set against it, by convenient 
turnings, that all parts of the stone may heat alike: Which 
may be done without any hinderance of any of the aforesayd 
uses. And by triall I find, that two about nine or ten inches 
long, and six or seven inches broad, will doe more service, and 
are more easie to bee found than a single one of double the 
length and bredth, because they will be lesse subject to breaking 
with falling, and are the more easily put to the fire and 
taken from it, and moved to and fro in the bed with more 
speed and ease than a great single one can be, yet may, beeing 
put together, fill a greater room than the single one could do, 
[^p.6^] [^Original misnumbered as p.8.^] 
by adding warmth, on each side, to any part of the body that 
shall lie betweene them, and likewise at one time bee applyed 
to severall places. And such poore people as have no fire of 
their owne, they may heat it at their neighbours fire, which 
will damnifie them no more, then lighting one candle by another; 
and whereas no fire can be maintained without consuming 
the fewell which makes it, and that cannot be provided 
without continuall charge, according to the wasting 
thereof, this stone being so heated will keep his heat without 
cost for divers hours, in other places, but in the bed for a whol 
night, and that without renewing the heat, or troubling the 
rest of the party, who needeth the warmth of it. These uses 
and experiments will be verified, by the witnesse of many persons 
who have very often, and doe dayly make use thereof, 
some of which have not bin more averse, from being perswaded 
to try it in the beginning, then afterwards they have been 
loath to leave the benefits they have found thereby; and I 
am very confident that by due observation of the quality of 
these Stones, many other uses of them will be found out, besides 
these here mentioned. 
 
This same stone being laid under the head of a childe that 
was much stopt in his breath by a cold, did in one night clear 
and free the passage of his breath: and likewise being laid 
under the head of an old man that was very deafe, did in such 
sort helpe him, that his neighbours wondered to see the 
change that was wrought in him. 
 
An ancient Doctor of Physick of London testifies 
it gave a Patient of his more ease in the cure of the 
Sciatica, then any outvvard Medicine that he could 
apply.
