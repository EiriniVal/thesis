[}Of the diuision & order 
of this booke. The fyrst Chapiter.}] 
 
BIcause that 
nothynge done 
vnorderly cann 
be well vnderstanded 
of the 
reders, & euery 
thi~ge the better 
ordre it hathe, 
y=e= beter it may 
be vnderstand, and also moche more 
easely be remembred; when the ordre 
of it is well and certenly knowne. I 
haue therfore digested this boke into 
a certayne and orderly processe, which 
I shall here set furthe to thentent that 
you may rede, as it were in grosse, the 
[/1./] 
whole booke, and thereby kepe it the 
better in remembraunce. 
 
i. Fyrst therfore I wyll declare the 
nature of vrine, what it is, and how 
it is engendred within man, and how 
it passeth furth from man. 
 
ij. Necte, of the ordre of rexeuyng it 
with vessell dew. And of the tyme and 
place meete to consydre it. 
 
[^f.9v^] 
Thyrdly, how many thynges ar to 
be co~sidred in vrin. & how many ways 
they may be altered in a helthful man. 
 
Fourthly, what significations & 
tokens may be gethered of vrine, concernyng 
any alteration in man, other 
paste, or present, or to cum. 
 
Fyfthly, to what vse in medicine 
vrine may serue, and of other good vses 
of it to mannes commoditie. 
 
And last of all, I wyll declare certayne 
diseases touchyng vrine, which 
other let it, or cause it to voyde vnwyllyngly: 
with the medicines and remedies 
meete for the same. 
 
[}How vrine is engendred in Man, and how 
it passeth furth. The .2. Chapter.}] 
 
AS vnto them that ar lerned, & 
know by the art of Anatomy 
the situation of the partes of 
man, and the naturall offyce of euery 
parte, it is esye ynough to perceue the 
original generation and cause of vrine 
without any example, so vnto theym 
that nother knowe the situation nor 
 
[^f.10r^] 
offices, no nother yet the names of the 
partes of mannes bodye, it is scarse 
possyble to make them to perceue the 
generacion of vrine without sum sensible 
example. But bycause it is very 
harde to fynde an artificiall example, 
whiche can a lone duly expresse this 
worke of nature, I wyll vse therfore 
an example of a natural worke, which 
shall expresse in menny poyntes this 
thyng, though not in all: for soche can 
there none be, but the thyng it selfe. 
And in as moche as this example is 
not easy to be vnterstand of all men, 
though the most parte do now a daies 
partely know it by experience of fyndyng 
springes of waters. I wyll fyrst 
propose an artificial example, to make 
the other bothe y=e= beter to be perceued 
 
It is daily sene in distillyng of waters, 
that the temperate heate of the 
[/2./] 
fyer doth seperate the purest parte of 
the iuce fro~ the herbes, & also from the 
grosser iuce. This by natural lightnes 
is drawen into the hed of the stillatore 
wher by the condenesse of the helmet it 
is made sumwhat grosser, & so thorow 
[^f.10v^] 
naturall heate descendeth and passeth 
furthe by the pype of the stillatory. 
And as the arte of man vseth to make 
[/3./] 
this water, so doth nature vse to make 
the water of springes, wherof cum all 
ryuers, stremes and flouddes, excepte 
the see. For seyng the erth is not parfectly 
sounde and thycke of substance, 
as stones and sum wooddes appereth 
to be, but is hollow and full of holes 
as you se that corke is: so that the ayer 
which by his subtylnes perseth euery 
neuer so lytle a hole, entreth & fylleth 
this hollownes, nature so ledyng it, 
bycause no place shulde be emptye in 
whiche place by the coldnesse of the 
erth, the ayer is turned into water, as 
you may see in walles and pyllers of 
stone, namely of marble, how the coldnesse 
of the stone turneth the ayer into 
water & hangeth full of drops, which 
sum tyme tryckle downe a pace, as if 
they dyd swete. So when the erth 
hath turned the ayer thus into water, 
then doth it dropp downe & gethereth 
to gether, and so runneth out as it can 
fynde or prepare way. As longe therfore 
[^f.11r^] 
as there is hollownesse in that 
place, with soche sorte of coldenesse, & 
none other let, the spring of water shal 
neuer sease. But and if the way by any 
menes be stopped, then the water tormoyleth 
and laboreth, other to expell 
that let, or to make a new way. 
 
Now this water beynge thus engendred 
of the ayer, which hath no taste, 
[/4./] 
is also naturally without all taste but 
the tast that it hath, is the taste of the 
vaynes of erth or metall, by which it 
doth ru~ne. And that is the cause that 
sum waters are sweete; & sum sower, 
sum fresh, and sum salte, & other ways 
dyuersely taysted: sum also ar hotte & 
sum colde, and with other lyke qualities 
endued, accordyng to the ground 
wherby it passeth: But of this I wyll 
not now speke, bicause I haue appointed 
for it a peculyer treatyse, if God 
graunte me tyme. Onely this I say 
now, that a man that is experte, can 
by y=e= colour, taste, and other qualities 
of the water, which he seyth, tel what 
vaynes of earthe or mettalles is in 
that place whence that water cu~meth 
[^f.11v^] 
though he see it not. 
 
And this water is expelled out of 
his fyrst place as vnprofytable there 
to remayne and yet when it is cum 
furth thence, it is good for dyuerse & 
sundry vses. Thus may we thynke of 
the generation & vse of vrine or mans 
[/5./] 
water. It shall not nede here to reken 
exactly the places, causes & thordre of 
the .iij. co~coctions which go before the 
generation of vrine but it shall suffyce 
to tell brefely, that of the meate & the 
drynke together concocted in the stomake, 
is made rude bloude (if I may 
so cal it) which rude bloud is wrought 
agayn and made more perfecter in the 
lyuer: and thyrdly yet more purifyed 
in the hollow vayne where the vrine 
is separate fro~ it, as whey fro~ mylke: 
but yet may not exactly be called vrine 
tyll it cum into the raynes (or kydnes) 
which draw it out of the hollow vayn 
by a certayne naturall power restyng 
in them/ And then doth the raynes (or 
kydneys) alter it parfectely into vrine, 
as the coldenes of the ground turneth 
ayer into water. But you must take 
[^f.12r^] 
this comparison or similitude too be 
spoken of the alteration it self & not of 
the cause. Now whan vrine is this 
made, lyke to the facyon of water, as 
I sayde, then as the water passeth 
furth from his fyrst place, by ysshewes 
outwarde, so doth the vrine descende 
from the raynes by certayne vaynes 
(as it were) called water pypes, and 
runneth into the bladder: fro~ whence 
at due tymes, it is expelled furth if the 
way be not let. So that you may compare 
the raynes to y=e= hed of a cu~dyte: 
the water pypes, to the cu~dyte pypes: 
the bladder, too the cundyte: and the 
shafte to the cocke of the cundyte. 
 
And further as the water doth declare 
by taste & colour, the qualyties 
of the erth, or vaynes of metall, wherby 
it runneth and from whence it cummeth: 
so the vrine by coloure & other 
wayes, declareth of what sorte the places 
that it cu~meth thorow, & humors 
that it cummeth from, are affected. 
 
And yet not onely serueth for this, 
but also as the water though it dep~te 
from the erth, as superfluous in that 
place, yet in other places and to other 
[^f.12v^] 
purposes it is greatly profytable. So 
the vrine, though it be expelled as a 
superfluous excrement, yet besyde this 
commodytie of iudgement, whiche it 
geueth of the partes that it cummeth 
fro~, it doth also serue for dyuerse vses 
in medicine, and other good commodyties: 
of which both I wyll anon orderly 
wryte, after I haue declared certayne 
thinges appertaining to the 
dew iudgement of it.

[^f.13v^] 
[}What vrine is, and what tokens it geueth 
in generall. The .3. Chapiter.}] 
 
YOU haue herde now how vrine 
is engendered, from whence it 
cummeth, and by what places 
it passeth. the which thynges all to 
thentent that you may the better kepe 
in mynde, you shall note this shorte diffinicion. 
[/6./] 
Vrine is the superfluitie or 
wheye substaunce of the bloude in the 
hollow vayne, co~ueyed by the renes & 
water pypes into the bladder. 
 
So that hereby you may plainly perceue, 
that if the blodde be pure & clene, 
& none other grefe in the renes; water 
pipes, bladder, nor shafte: then shal the 
vrine so declare it, beyng also parfecte 
and pure in substance and coloure and 
al other tokens accordyng to the same 
But if there be any greefe in any of 
those partes, or the blood corrupte by 
any menes, then shal the vrine declare 
certen tokens of the same, as I shall 
anone particulerly expresse. But fyrst 
it shalbe necessary to instruct you of 
the vessel, place & tyme meete to iudge 
vrine, & of the maner of receuyng it. 
[^f.14r^] 
 
[}Of the sonne of the Vrynall, and of place and 
tyme meete to iudge vryne, and how it shuld 
be receued. The .4. chapiter.}] 
 
THat vrine shuld be kepte to see, 
which is first made after mydnyght 
co~menly, or namely when 
the pacie~t hath slept lo~g. but you must 
take heede (whether the pacient be ma~ 
or woman) that they make not their 
[/7./] 
vrine in a nother vessell fyrst (as many 
vse to do) & then powre it in to the vrinall 
when it is setled, for that causeth 
moch deceite & error in the iudgement 
of it. And if that the pacyent can not 
well make it in the vrinall, other by 
wekenesse, or any other cause, then let 
them make it in an other vessell, but se 
that it be clene & dry: & as sone as the 
water is made, powre it furth streight 
wayes into the vrinall all together, & 
leue no parte of it out, as sum curious 
folke do vse to put the clere parte only 
into the vrinall & cast a way the dregges: 
as though it stode not with their 
honesty to bryng soche foule gere to 
the Physicion, other of any lyke folysh 
mynd. Powre it therfore in wholly, 
and let not the vrinall stand open, 
 
[^f.14v^] 
namely in a dusty place, but stopp it 
close w=t= a gloue or other lether, & not 
with cloth, paper, nor hey, and let it 
be brought to the Physicion within 
vj. howers at the surdest: for after that 
tyme it can not well be iudged. 
 
Now as touchyng the Vrinall, it 
[/8./] 
shulde be of pure clere glasse, not thyck 
nor greene in colour, without blottes 
or spottes in it, not flat in the bottom, 
nor to wyde in the necke, but widest in 
the myddell and narrow styll towarde 
bothe the endes, lyke the facyon commenly 
of an egg, or of a very bladder 
beyng mesurably blowen (for the vrinal 
shuld represe~t the bladder of a ma~) 
and so shall euery thyng be sene in his 
dew place and coloure if nother the 
grossenes of the vrinal, nother the colour, 
nor spottes shal let the true syght 
of the colour, and substaunce of the vryne; 
and the contentes of it nother 
the dyfforme facyon of the vrinall shal 
alter the regio~s or romes of the vrine. 
 
Lyke wayes concernynge the place 
[/9./] 
meete to beh old vrines you must loke 
that it be nother to darke, so that your 
 
[^f.15r^] 
syght shuld not discerne parfectly other 
the coloure, substaunce or contentes 
or lacke of lyght: nother yet that your 
syght be likeways deceued, if the place 
be to lyght, as in open lyght or bemes 
of the sunne. 
 
Besydes this also must ye marke the 
[/10./] 
tyme dew to behold vrines: but bycause 
there can no one tyme be assygned certayne 
and exacte to iudge all partes of 
it, I wyll breefely shew he order of the 
thynges to be consydered in their tyme. 
 
Fyrst, when the vrine is made, whyle 
it is yet sumwhat hotte, you shall consyder 
the coloure of it: for that may best 
be descerned then, and lyke wayes the 
thycknes of the substaunce of it: which 
if it be meane, shall then be best sene. All 
other thynges, as the bubles, & the contentes 
shalbe best iudged sumwhat after 
when the vrine is sumwhat cooled, and 
they be duly setled in their p~per places. 
 
[}How many thynges ar to be consydered 
in Vryne. The 5. Chapiter.}] 
 
NOw leuyng this as a breefe instruction, 
of the generation of the 
water or vrine, and of the maner 
[^f.15v^] 
of receuyng it in vessels due, with tyme 
and place meete to consyder it. I wyll 
particulerly declare how many thinges 
ar to be consydered in it, which ar commenly 
named .iiij. that is the substance 
the colour, the quantytie, and the contentes: 
and the sauoure thereto may be 
added as the fyfte: to the whiche .v. if 
you shall ioyne stablenes & order as .ij. 
accide~tes co~men to the first .iiij. thinges 
but yet no lesse to be co~sidered then the 
then shall you iudge the more certenly. 
 
Stablenesse is called, when the vrine 
[/11./] 
continueth certen dayes together of one 
sorte. And if if alter euery day, then is 
that called vnstablenesse or chaungeablenesse, 
[/12./] 
to which thyng ordre doth appertayne: 
For ordre is the folowyng of 
[/13./] 
one thyng after an other, as blacke coloured 
vrine after whyte, grene or pale. 
I meane not, bycause that so it ought to 
folow, but onely that you must obserue 
how it doth follow. For blacke vrine 
doth nott sygnify the same, if it follow 
after grene vrine, as it doth, if it follow 
after white vrine: so that the ordre ought 
also to be marked. 
 
[^f.16r^] 
But now to retourne to the .iij. fyrste 
thynges. Substaunce is called in 
[/14./] 
vrine, the vrine it selfe in respecte of the 
thyknesse or thynnesse of it: so that there 
ar .iij. sortes of substance in vrine: thicke 
thynne, and meane. Thynne substance 
[/15./] 
is called, when you may perceue wel the 
ioyntes of your fyngers through the vryne. 
And contrary wayes it is called 
thycke, when you can nott well see your 
[/16./] 
fyngers through it: and that that is in 
the myddle betweene extreeme thycke & 
extreme thynne, is called, meane. 
[/17./] 
 
Colours ar dyuerse, but the principal 
[/18./] 
are these .vj. whyte, pale, flaxen, yellow, 
red, and blacke. And all the other coloures 
ar contayned vnder these .vi. 
 
As vnder whyte, ar contayned clere as 
[/19./] 
cristall, whyte as snow, & pure as water 
which .iij. are lyght whytes. Then are 
there other .iij. more darker, as mylke 
[/20./] 
whyte, clere lyke horne, and grey. 
 
After whyte, followeth pale coloure, & 
[/21./] 
then flaxen, after it followeth palew, & 
then yellow, which may be called golde~, 
for it is the coloure of pure golde. 
 
After it followeth lyght saffren, & then 
[/22./] 
 
[^f.16v^] 
saffren, then clarer coloure, & then redd: 
[/23./] 
after it crymsyn, and then purple, and 
[/24./] 
then blew. Then is there grene of dyuerse 
[/25./] 
kyndes: as light greene, grene as 
[/26./] 
grasse, starke grene, and darke grene. 
[/27./] 
 
[/28./] 
There are also oyle coloures (that is 
[/29./] 
popi~gey grene) of .iij. sortes, as of grene: 
[/30./] 
lyght oylye, starke oylye, & darke oylye. 
[/31./] 
After these is there assh coloure, lyke vnto 
[/32./] 
led: and after it (as last of all) cu~meth 
blacke, & these be the chefe coloures. 
 
Now as touching quantitie, it is als 
[/33./] 
in .iij. sortes, moche, lytle, and meane. 
[/34./] 
Then is it called moche quantytie, whe~ 
[/35./] 
it excedeth the measure of a mans drinkyng: 
[/36./] 
and then is it called lytle, when a 
man pysseth lesse then he drinketh. 
 
And y=t= is meane, when a manne is pyssyng 
and his drinkyng is of lyke quantytie. 
Al this must be considered by dew 
proporcion. The contentes ar al thinges 
[/37./] 
in the water, that be of another matter 
[/38./] 
and substaunce particulerly, then is 
[/39./] 
the vrine: as the sedyment or grounde, 
[/40./] 
the sublacion or swymme, & the cloude. 
To these ar added other dyfforme co~tentes; 
lyke herys, lyke huskys, lyke bran, 
[^f.17r^] 
and soch other. And also the crowne of 
the vrine, with the bubbyls, and other 
thynges swymmyng on the top of it. 
 
For the better vndestandyng of these 
contentes, you must note, that the whole 
vrine from the top to the bottome, is deuyded 
commenly into .iij. romes or regions. 
The lowermost is the region of 
the grounde or sedyment: so that the 
[/41./] 
groundes or sedymentes ar the contentes 
that occupy the lowermost region: or 
yet more properlye the sedymente is 
called a certen substance of grosser mater 
then is the vrin, lyke to a qua~tytie of 
very watery flewme, which fleteth a lytel 
aboue the bottom of the vrine: but if it 
be so lyght, that is swym in the myddle 
[/42./] 
region of the vrine, then is it called the 
sublation or swym. And if it be yet more 
lyghter, so that it doth fleete in the highest 
parte of the vrine, then is it called a 
[/43./] 
cloude: whereby you may perceue that 
the grounde, the swym, and the cloude, 
are but one thyng in substance, & dyffer 
only by lyghtnes and hefte, and taketh 
his name accordyng to the region that 
it occupyeth. But yet agayne note that 
[^f.17v^] 
euery one of the .iij. regions is farther deuided 
into other partes also, wherby you 
may know exactly how far all conte~tes 
differ from the iust roume of their regio~: 
so that the whole vrine must be deuyded 
into a xj. iust partes, of which the nether 
region occupieth .iiij: the .v. is the voyde 
roome bytweene that and the myddle region, 
which conteineth .iii. more. that 
is to say, the syxte, seuenth and eyght. 
And then the nyenth is a voyde roume 
betweene the myddle regyon and the 
hyghest: which hyghest regyon, conteyneth 
the other two partes that remaine, 
that is the tenth & the leuenth, 
as this Fygure sheweth 
whyche here after 
folowyth. 
 
[^f.18r^] 
[^An image of a vessel omitted.^] 
Aboue these 
iij. regions, 
about 
the very brinke 
or the vrin 
you may see a 
certen rynge 
as it were goyng 
about, & 
that is called 
[/44./] 
the crowne. 
Hightest of al 
thynges in 
the vrine are 
the bubbels, 
[/45./] 
which other go about with the ryng only, 
or els fleete in the myddell of the vrin 
only, or els bothe. Yea, sumtyme they 
couer all the whole topp of the vryne. 
Besyde these is there often tymes as it 
[/46./] 
were a flotes, or fattynes on the topp, 
and sumtymes certayne spottes onely 
which are lyke to droppes of oyle. And 
these commenly ar the whole contentes. 
For as for grauell or stone, or any lyke 
thyng is conteyned vnder the name of 
[^f.18v^] 
dyfforme contentes. You shall also 
vnderstande that in the conte~tes must 
the substaunce, the quantyte & coloure 
be obserued. The substaunce is other 
[/47./] 
equall or vnequall. Equall substaunce 
[/48./] 
is called, when the grounde, swym or 
cloude (for to them apparteyneth this 
consyderation) is not tattered and dispersed, 
but iustly knyt together. 
 
Vnequal is co~trary, when it is thynne 
[/49./] 
in one parte then in another, or flyttered 
out, and not suantly and vniformly 
ioyned together. The quantyte 
[/50./] 
must be consydered in respecte to a 
meane, which if you know well, then 
may you soone iudge that to be ouer 
moche, that is more then it: and 
that to be to lyttle, that is lesse then 
it. But this meane quantyte must you 
lerne of a parfyte whole water, & best 
by the teching of sum good physicion. 
Of coloures I haue spoken before sufficiently 
for their varyetie. 
 
[}What a parfyte Vryne is, and also how many 
wayes all partes of the vryne may be 
altered in a helthfull man. 
The .6. Chapiter.}] 
 
[^f.19r^] 
NOw that you know the differe~ce 
of soche thynges that ought to 
be co~sidered in vrine, before you 
shal lerne by consyderacion of them, 
to iudge of the parsone that made it, 
how he is dysposed in his bodye: you 
must fyrst know how many wayes the 
partes of the vrine may be chaunged 
in a helthfull man. For the better vnderstandyng 
of the which thyng, and 
of all that shal be seyd hereafter, I wyl 
fyrst defyne what a parfecte whole vryne 
is: which as it be tokeneth no grefe 
in it selfe, so is it a trew rule to examyne 
all other vrines by that are not 
hole, but declare in them sum greefe. 
 
A parfyte hole vrine is meane in substau~ce, 
[/51./] 
and in quantyte, and in colour 
palew, or partie saffren, with a whyte 
grounde, duly knyt, and stable, without 
bubles and other euyll contentes. 
So that this parfyte hole vrine declareth 
the dyfference of al other vrines: 
For euery vrine the more it a greyth 
with this, the better it is: & the more 
it dyffereth from this, the worse it is, 
as I shall anone partyculerly declare. 
[^f.19v^] 
And here you must marke that 
this parfecte hole vrine is not only taken 
of a parfect hole man, but also of 
the lustyest tyme of ma~nes age, that is 
at .xxx. yeres: or more largely, betwene 
xxv. and .xxxv. For in euery age doth 
the vrine after, as you shal here by & by 
 
[}The dyfference of Vryne by age in men.}] 
 
[/52./] 
THe vrine of Chyldren differeth but 
lyttle in coleur from palew or light 
[/53./] 
saffren, and in substaunce it sumwhat 
excedeth in thyckenesse the substaunce 
of young mennes vrine, & hath moche 
[/54./] 
grounde in it: And the more they doo 
grow in age, the hygher waxeth the 
coloure, the substaunce the thynner, & 
the lesse is the grounde. And therfore 
[/55./] 
when age is most freshest, the colour is 
palew (so that the vrine of florishyng 
youth or parfyte manhod, is pallew 
or lyght saffren) and there resteth and 
goeth no hygher, and the grownde of 
it is meane: But now after that tyme, 
the more age encreseth & youth decayeth. 
the more the colour chau~geth from 
[/56./] 
pallew toward whyte, & the grownde 
[^f.20r^] 
waxeth lesser & darker: so that the vryne 
of Olde men is thynne & whyte, 
w=t= lytle grou~de, enclini~g vnto crudytie 
 
[}Of the vryne of Women by age.}] 
 
THe vrine of women which ar temperate, 
[/57./] 
in health & in their flourishyng 
youth, doth declyne sumwhat fro~ 
palew, & lyght saffren toward whyte, 
and the substau~ce is in maner thynne: 
but it hath more grounde then me~nes 
vrine. Now all thei that be vnder this 
[/58./] 
flourishing age, the yonger thei be, the 
whyter coloured is their vrine, & the 
more grounde it hath: and if they be 
older, the more aged they ar, the whyter 
[/59./] 
also is their vrine, but the grounde 
is euer lesse & lesse. And thys you may 
se how both diuersytie of age, & dyuersitie 
also of kynd of sexe causeth alteration 
in vrine without chau~ge of helth: 
for you must vnderstand all these ages 
with parfyte helth. 
 
[}The diuersytie of vrynes, accordyng to 
the tymes of the yere}] 
 
[^f.20v^] 
EUen as diuersytie of ages altereth 
vrine, so doth the tymes of the yere: 
For the more that y=e= spring tyme draweth 
towarde heate, the more the vryne 
[/60./] 
gethereth hygh colour, departyng fro~ 
pale and flaxen, toward palew & light 
safferite: & the inequalyte of substau~ce 
chaungeth into a dewe equalytie accordyng 
to nature, and the grounde doth 
waxe thynner, & the quantytie is more 
in respecte to that is dronke: so that about 
the myddest of the spring they retourne 
to a meane. In the beginnyng 
of summer the colour appereth palew 
[/61./] 
and lyght saffren, and the substaunce 
meane, the ground whyte, dewly knyt 
& stable, but yet thynner then a meane 
grounde. And the more that the su~mer 
procedeth and draweth to the highest, 
the lesser is the quantytie of vryne in 
comparyso~ to the drynke, & the grou~d 
chau~geth from his naturall whytenes 
to a palysh colour, & is moch lesser and 
thynner. And this thynnes glystereth 
with all and enclyneth toward golden 
and saffren coloure. When Heruest 
[/62./] 
cummeth, then the coloures retourne 
[^f.21r^] 
to a menes agayne: but the thynnesse 
and brightnesse remayneth styll, the 
grounde also is styll obscure and lytle, 
but yet it is white, deuly knyt & stable. 
And as heruest goeth forward, so the 
vrine returneth to a meane in all thinges. 
In the myddle of wynter & there 
about, the vrine kepeth dew quantitie, 
but the colour enclineth toward white 
and the ground is ouer great, but in al 
other pointes it is mene. And as wynter 
[/63./] 
goeth on, the substaunce of vryne 
appereth dyuerse, & the colour whyte, 
the quantytie greater in respest to the 
drinke, and the contentes greater and 
vnconcocte, but toward the sprynge 
tyme they retourne towarde a meane, 
as I haue before sayd. Yet besyde 
these also dyuersytie of cou~treyes causeth 
[/64./] 
dyuersytie of vryne, euen by the 
same reasons as doth the tymes of the 
yere. For cou~treyes that be temperate 
exactly, make vrine lyke vnto y=e= spring 
tyme. And those countreyes that be 
hotte and drye, make vryne lyke vnto 
summer. And contrary wayes colde & 
[/65./] 
moyst alter water as dothe wynter. 
[^f.21v^] 
But countreyes that are drye and distempered 
betwene heate & colde, make 
vryne lyke heruest. Also meates and 
[/66./] 
drynkes and order of dyete causeth vryne 
to alter, & medicynes also, as not 
only experye~ce teacheth, but also Hippocrates 
wytnesseth in the .vi. boke of 
his Epidemys (or rainyng sicknesses) 
in the .v. parte & the .xv. sentence: as 
for example. Those meates that are 
lyght of concoction and good in substaunce, 
cause good and temperate vryne 
with pure contentes: but contrary 
meates cause discoloured vryne and 
thynne, with straunge contentes. 
 
Meates that wyll not concoct, make 
lesser contentes, & dyuerse in substau~ce. 
Euyll meates cause greater contentes 
and in nothyng duly formed. And as 
the qualitie of meates doth alter vrine, 
so dothe the qua~titie also. For if a man 
haue eaten moche, & not concocted it, 
his vryne shalbe thynne & whyte, and 
sumtyme without grounde. But if this 
crudyte (or rawnesse in stomake) contynew 
long, the vryne wyll be cum dyuerse 
in substaunce, and in contentes. 
[^f.22r^] 
Also vryne dronke abundasitly, causeth 
alteration in vryne. But now contrary 
wayes, if a man do fast long, his vrine 
wyll appere fyrie and saffren coloured 
and thynne, with lesser ground. But if 
a man suffer famyn & doo not nourysh, 
his water shal be thynne & whyte with 
a certeyn glysteryng, & without grou~d. 
More ouer exercyce and rest chaungeth 
[/67./] 
vryne: for thorow excessyue labour, the 
vryne chaungeth from lyght saffren, & 
at lengthe becummeth saffren coloured 
with lytle grounde, thynne, & hygher 
coloured then it shuld be. And sumtime 
there flecieth on the toppe a certeyne 
fattynes, specially after ouer moch werynesse. 
But idlenesse & rest dothe contrary 
[/68./] 
wayes cause whyte vryne, with 
greater and grosser grounde. Furthermore, 
sleepe and watchyng, if they excede 
[/69./] 
measure, they alter vryne: but 
there is difference betwene bothe sleepe 
and watchyng cummyng of sycknesse, 
& them bothe when they be taken wyllyngly 
in health. For if that sycknesse 
cause ouer moche sleepe, then is the vryne 
whytysh, whith substau~ce other fully 
[^f.22v^] 
thycke or but party thynne, and the 
contentes many and vndygest. But if 
that soche sleepe cum naturally, the vryne 
is not so whyte, but rather flaxen, 
and the substaunce meane, with greater 
and well concocte contentes. And lyke 
wayes they that haue watched purposedly 
& not by reason of sycknesse, their 
vrine is but lytle chau~ged. But if they 
watche for any syckly cause, their vryne 
wyl chau~ge but lytle at the beginnyng: 
but with contynuaunce the contentes 
wyll be dysparsed, & at last cleane wasted, 
& the substaunce of the vryne waxeth 
thynner & thynner by lytle & lytle, & 
the colour enclineth other to whyte and 
watery: other to golden, saffren, oylye, 
or blacke, accordi~g as the cause is, that 
maketh it so to chaunge. Of alteration 
by complexio~, I wyll wryte in the next 
chapyter. Now haue you herde as 
touchyng alteration of vryne in helth, 
accordyng to dyuersytie of ages bothe 
in men and women, tymes of the yere, 
countreys, meates & drynkes, laboure, 
rest, sleepe & watche: so that you must 
haue regarde to these, in al iudgeme~tes 
[^f.23r^] 
bothe in health and in sicknesse. For if 
these be nott dilygently marked, they 
may cause great error as you may well 
consyder. fyrst therfore in euery vryne 
you must co~sidre, whether it be a ma~ns 
or a womannes, and what ager he or she 
is of: then what tyme of the yere it is, 
and what countrey, what meates and 
drynkes the person vsed: & lyke wayes 
of labor & rest sleepe and watche: and 
then must you consydre how euery one 
of these dothe alter vryne: so that if the 
alteryng of them from that helthful vryne 
(wherof I spake in the beginning 
of this chapiter) be but soche as one of 
these foresayd thinges wold cause, then 
may it not be iudged to cum of any disease, 
as for example: Hygh coloured 
water in somer (so that it passe not safferne 
coloure) or whyte coloured water 
in wynter, shulde rather be rekoned to 
cum of the time of the yere, then to any 
sycknesse: & lyke ways of other thi~ges. 
 
[}What be the generall qualyties that 
aker the partes of Vryne. 
The .vii. Chapiter.}] 
 
[^f.23v^] 
BEfore I intreate of the sygnifycation 
of the partes of vryne, I 
thynke it good to instructe you 
of the generall qualyties, which cause 
all alterations in vryne: whereby you 
shall perceyue not onely what euery vryne 
doth be token (as I shall a non set 
furth) but also if you marke well this 
chapiter, you shall see the cause why euery 
vryne dothe so sygnify. 
 
You shall vnderstand therfore that 
there be .iiij. cheefe and only qualyties 
wherof all thynges that ar both in the 
see & earth are made: as man & beast: 
fysh & foule: trees, herbes, stones and 
metals. These .iiij. qualyties ar heate, 
colde, moystnesse and drynesse: & these 
iiij. contynuyng duly tempered ( as nature 
ordered them fyrst in euery p~fytt 
body) be the cause of contynual helth. 
But if they be altered wrongly, then 
doo they cause dyseases dyuersely, accordyng 
to the dyuersytie of the alterations. 
And as the doo cause dyseases, 
so they chau~ge y=e= colour, substau~ce, 
and other partes of the vryne, wherby 
we may coniecture the cause of the disease: 
[^f.24r^] 
and so consequently the dysease 
it selfe, though sumtyme it declareth 
the disease it self, & not the cause therof 
 
But now to come to the mater metest 
for this tyme, you shal marke, that 
ij. of these .iiij. qualities ar named passyue, 
and they cause but small alteration 
in comparyson. The other .ij. are 
called actyue, and they cause great alteratio~. 
The actyue qualyties ar heate 
and colde, & the passyue qualyties are 
drynesse & moystnesse. When moystnes 
[/70./] 
therfore excedeth alone, it dulleth 
the naturall colour of vryne, thycketh 
and engrosseth the substaunce and encreaseth 
the qua~tytie. Ans as the ouer 
parte of it aboue waxeth rough & troubled, 
so the grounde encreseth & contynueth 
raw & vnconcocte. But drynesse 
[/71./] 
dothe dyminysh the quantytie of 
vryne and also the contentes: It maketh 
it thynne in substau~ce, cleare and 
bryght, and causeth meane coloure, & 
the grounde appereth grosser. 
 
Lyke waies heate, if it excede measure 
[/72./] 
but lytle, it maketh palew & lyght 
saffern colour in the vryne. But if heat 
[^f.24v^] 
excyde greatly, it canseth golden and 
safferne colour, with meane substau~ce, 
and a lytle bryghtnesse: the grounde is 
meane in respecte to the qua~tytie of vryne, 
but it declyneth from the dew 
whytenesse toward safferne coloure. 
 
[/73./] 
But colde on the other syde maketh 
vryne tourne to whyte coloure, and 
chau~geth the substaunce fro~ a meane. 
And if the colde increase, the vryne wyl 
alter from meane substau~ce, & therfore 
consequently wyll be other thynne, other 
grosse. If it be thynne or vnpure 
the grounde shall be other obscure and 
lytle, other moche, & that dyuerse and 
vnco~cocte. And this is the working of 
these .iiij. qualyties when they excyde 
alone. But and if .ij. of them excyde 
to gether, there may result of that som 
iiij. other dystemperaunces: as hotte 
and drye, hotte and moyst, colde & dry, 
[/74./] 
and colde and moyst. Now what alterations 
these & euery one of them doth 
cause in vryne, you may easely coniecture, 
if you keepe in mynd that, that I 
saide of the .iiij. symple qualyties: and 
so adde together the alterations. And 
[^f.25r^] 
this must you reme~ber therewith, that 
where they both agre in any alteratio~ 
they cause that alteratio~ to be the gretter: 
and where they be contrary, they 
cause the alteration to be nearer to a 
meane: howe be it sumwhat to helpe 
you, take this brefe declaration. As a 
temperate man doth make that parfecte 
vryne written of before, so the vryne 
of a sanguyne man (which is hot 
and moyst) sahll be yelow, or lyght safferne 
coloured by the reaso~ of y=e= heat, 
and sumwhat grosse, by the reason of 
the moysture. In a coloricke man (beyng 
hotte and dry) the vryne shall be in 
coloure as in a sanguyne man, but in 
substau~ce thynne, by reason of the drynesse. 
The vryne of a melancolye 
man (whose nature is colde and drye) 
shall be whyte thorough the colde, and 
cleare, for the drynesse. the phlegmatycke 
man (which is colde and moyst) 
maketh vryne whyte thorough colde, 
and thyck by the moysture. for as heat 
and colde altereth the coloures, so drynesse 
and moysture chaungeth the substaunce. 
Now if you haue reme~bred 
[^f.25v^] 
all that I haue wrytten before, then 
shal you be the meeter, and better able 
a great deale to perceyue the reasons 
of the tokens which vryne doth geue. 
And so shal your knoulege be the more 
certeyn, if you know not only the thi~g 
but also the cause of it. Now therfore 
wyll I wryte of the sygnifycations of 
the partes of vryne partycurerly, that 
you may perceyue that fyrst and cheife 
commodytie of vryne which it worketh 
for mannes health. 
 
[}The sygnifycations of the partes of vryne 
partyculerly The .viij. Chapiter.}] 
 
I Told you in the .vj. chapiter of this 
boke, what vryne was most parfect 
fownde, and healthfull of all other: 
And I sayde that it was the rule and 
tryall to examyn all other vrynes by: 
so that the nearer that any vryne were 
vnto it, the better it were: and the further 
that it declyneth fro~ it, the worse 
it is. This (I sayde) shulde be as a generall 
rule: which thyng to be trew in 
healthfull men, you may perceyue by 
that I haue written all redy. And that 
[^f.26r^] 
it is also trew in sycke men, Hyppocrates 
wytnesseth, sayeng: That vryne is 
best, whose ground is whyte, duly knyt 
and stable, all the tyme the syckenesse 
preuayleth. But Galen, to supply that 
that is vnderstand in this sayeng, and 
so to make it parfecte, addeth thereto: 
That it must be of colour partye golden 
or palew, and of a meane substau~ce 
betwene thycke and thynne. And also 
in these thynges is requyred stablenes, 
to make it a parfecte vryne: for that 
that is vnstable in any parte, in that it 
is not parfecte. Here were a place to 
speke of the difference of this chaungeablenesse 
or vnstablenesse: for there is 
one sorte called ordynary, and a nother 
called vnordynary and of both, these 
are there dyuerse dyfferences. But bycause 
they depend of an exacter iudgement 
then vnlerned me~ can wel atteyn 
vnto, I ouer passe them for this tyme, 
and wyll declare the other dyfferences 
of vryne, whereby it altereth fro~ this 
meane vrine, in al partes particulerly. 
And fyrst I wyl begynne with the substaunce 
[/75./] 
of vryne, the which (as I sayd 
[^f.26v^] 
before) is of iiij. kyndes, thyck, thynne 
[/76./] 
and meane. A meane vryne is that, 
that is in the myddle betweene extreme 
thycke, and extreme thynne. And as it 
is meane betwene them in substau~ce, 
so is it meane in sygnifycation for it 
doth betoke~ (of it selfe) only good temperaunce 
& health. But the other .ij. be 
token diste~peraunce & defaulte of concoction, 
& that dyuersly, accordyng to 
the diuersytie of the causes of them, as 
[/77./] 
you shal now co~seque~tly heare. Fyrst to 
speke of thynne vryne, other it doth styl 
so contynew thynne, as it was fyrst 
made, other elles it dothe shortly waxe 
thycke and troubled. That that doth 
contynew styll thynne, doth betoken 
lacke of concoction, & so doth the other 
also: but yet this that co~tinueth thinne 
betokeneth more lacke of concoction: 
for it betokeneth that nature hath not 
yet begon to concocte. And therfore is 
that water, a sygne of extreme crudytie 
or rawnesse in nature. But that that 
waxeth thycke, after it begynneth to 
coole, though it betoken lacke of concoction, 
yet doth it declare that nature 
[^f.27r^] 
hathe begon to concocte all redye. not 
withstandyng it is an euyll vryne, for 
it signifieth that nature hath nede, not 
only of great strength to performe that 
concoction which she hath begon, but 
also that there is requyred long tyme 
to the performaunce of the same. for 
the which cause Galen calleth this, of 
all vrynes the worst. This haue you 
herde touchyng crudytie and concoctio~ 
what thynne vryne doth sygnifye, so 
that all thynne vrine be tokeneth crudytte. 
And besyde that, it doth further 
betoken (as wytnesseth Hippocrates) 
getheringes or apostumations in the 
nether partes of the body, namely, if 
it contynew so very longe, and the pacyent 
escape death. Further more, if 
soch thynne vrine haue with it a lyght 
[/78./] 
whytenesse, it is a very euyll sygne. for 
if it be in a burnyng Ague, it is a token 
of frensycknesse. But if the pacyent be 
fensycke all redy, and the vryne dothe 
so continew, it doth most commynly be 
token death. And if he escape death (the 
whiche is seldome sene) then shall he be 
longe sycke, and escape hardly. 
[^f.27v^] 
Thynne vryne also betokeneth dyuerse 
other thynges: as the stoppyng of the 
raynes, and of the water vaynes. And 
lyke wayes, if a man haue had moche 
bledyng, or laxe, or pyssyng, his vryne 
wyll be whyte and thynne, and almost 
without ground. Lyke maner, in olde 
age, and longe weakenesse of sycknes. 
Also in yonge chyldren, if it contynew 
longe, it is a deadly sygne. Yet thyn 
vrine doth sumtime betoken eande of 
sycknes and recouery of health: as in 
Agues (namely cotidianes) if at the 
beginnyng of them and so after, the vryne 
dyd appere thycke and troubled 
especially if the colour ame~d therwith, 
And if it be thynne in substau~ce, and of 
[/79./] 
flaxen colour, then is it better then 
thynne and whyte: for bycause the colour 
is better though the substau~ce be 
all one so that though it betoken sum 
wekenesse and lacke of concoction, yet 
not so moch as dothe the other, for the 
colour is meanely concocte: that is to 
say, natural heate is menely incresed. 
But if it be thynne & golden, it is yet 
[/80./] 
more better then thynne and flaxen: 
[^f.28r^] 
for the colour is more exacte/ and this 
be tokeneth concoctio~ halfe complete: 
for that that is lacked in substaunce, it 
hath in colour. After this is there 
[/81./] 
thynne & safferne coloured, which be 
tokeneth fyrst, lacke of concoction, and 
besyde that, defaulte of noryshment/ as 
in a yong man that fasteth longe. And 
sumtyme it be tokeneth that excesse of 
heate in the inner partes of the body, 
dothe cause colerycke humours to abounde, 
as in the feuer tertian. Besyde 
all this, it be tokeneth thought, carefulnesse, 
and watchyng, and also ouer 
muche labour, and takyng of heate in 
the sonne. And this haue you herde 
the sygnifycations of thynne vryne, 
bothe a lone, & also with soch coloures 
as it can be cowpyllyd. Now shal you 
heare what thycke vrine doth betoken 
bothe alone, & olso with soche dyuerse 
coloures, as it may be cowpyllyd. 
 
[/82./] 
Thycke vryne which is so (I meane 
when it is fyrst made) other it dothe 
continew styll thycke, other els it doth 
settle, and waxe cleare. If it contynew 
styll thycke, it betokeneth that that disturbaunce, 
[^f.28v^] 
which was in the blood, 
that is to say, the rage of sycknes, doth 
styll contynew strongly: and that naturall 
strength is but weake. this vryn 
is not so good as that which doth settell, 
and waxe cleare, for that doth be 
token, that the dysease shall shortly be 
ouercum: how be it there remayneth 
yet sumwhat of that dystemperate trobell 
in the blood. Yet nature hath the 
ouer hand, and expelleth the mater of 
the greefe, and therfore is soch a vryn 
called good. but yet it be tokeneth sum 
lacke of concoctio~, though not so moch 
as that which contynueth troubled & 
thycke styll. Also thycke vryne (if it be 
excedyng thycke) doth be token death, 
as Hippocrates sayth. And the vryne 
that is thycke and troubled, lyke beastes 
vryne, doth be token head ache, other 
present all redy, or shortly after to 
cum. If thycke vryne appere in an ague, 
where thynne bryne went before, 
it betokeneth that the syckenesse wyll 
abate streyght wayes, for it declareth 
that nature hath ouercum the mater 
of the sycknesse: but if it appere thicke 
[^f.29r^] 
at the begynnyng of the Ague, & doo 
not waxe thynne in p~cesse of tyme, it 
betokeneth plenty of mater, & wekenes 
of nature, so that there is feare, lest nature 
shalbe ouereu~, except y=e= colour do amende. 
Thycke vryne also betokeneth 
opennesse of the water pypes & reynes. 
And if it be thycke and whyte, it betokeneth 
[/83./] 
great plenty of raw humours, & 
su~dry kyndes of flewme to be gethered 
in the body, & betokeneth also (namely 
if it be moche) that those getherynges, 
which mought be loked for in sore Agues, 
shall not ensew: for the mater 
which shuld cause them, departeth out 
by vryne: but the whytenesse of this vryne 
is bryght as snowe. For if it be 
sumwhat darkerlyke y=e= whytenesse of 
mylke, it is a token of the stone, other 
in the bledder or reynes, namely if soch 
vrine chaunce in the ende & a mending 
of sickenes: but yf y=e= color of it be grey, 
[/84./] 
it be tokenith not only ple~ty of mater in 
the body, but also that the hole body is 
possessed with a dau~gerous syckenes. 
where of ofte~ tymes it chau~ceth y=e= pacie~t 
to breke out w=t= blisters & hete in his 
skyn. 
[^f.29v^] 
[/85./] 
Nexte after this foloweth thycke & clared 
colour (for flaxen, yellow, nor safferne 
colour doth not agree with thyck 
vryne) and it doth sygnify that the disease 
shall contynew longe, specyally if 
the grou~d of it be also of claret colour. 
But yet is this disease without peryll 
[/86./] 
of death. Thycke vryne, if it be red 
coloured, doth betoken abundaunce of 
blood, as is sene in contynuall Agues, 
and in all peryllous Agues, as wytnesseth 
Theophilus. If this water cum 
by lytle and lytle, it is an euyll token 
for it doth alwayes declare daunger. 
And if that sorte of vryne (in soche Agues) 
doo waxe troubled, so that there 
cum with it defenes of hearyng, and 
ache of the headd, with payne in the 
necke and in the sydes of the belly, it 
betokeneth that the pacyent shall haue 
the Fallyng euyll within a seue~nyght. 
And if a thycke vryne haue a crymsen 
[/87./] 
colour, if it be inburnyng Agues, and 
the pacyent then haue the hed ache, it 
betokeneth that a cheife crytycall sygne 
other is then present, or elles nygh at 
[/88./] 
hande. But if the vryne be thycke & 
[^f.30r^] 
blew coloured, it sygnifyeth dyuersely 
as the persones are that made it. For 
in them that are in way of recouery, it 
betokeneth that they shall escape their 
greife. It sygnifyeth also payne in the 
water pipes, or els that the party hath 
ru~ne moche. And if it appere soche in 
olde men, and that contynew longe, it 
declareth not onely that the bladder is 
infected with euyll humours but commenly 
also that he shal be ryd of them. 
But if it cum after the greife of the 
stone, it declareth that, that greife shall 
be turned into y=e= strangury. Thycke vryne 
and greene, namely in Agues, is 
[/89./] 
a token of the yellow Iawnders, other 
present, or redy to cum. Thycke vrine 
[/90./] 
& asshe coloured, if it appere in Agues 
and do not settle, it is a sygne of madnesse. 
But in the burnyng Ague, it betokeneth 
that the Stra~gury wyll cum 
shortly. But if blacke coloure appere 
[/91./] 
in thicke vryne, it be tokeneth somtyme 
well, as in the ende of the Feuer quarten, 
and of melancolyke madnesse for 
it betokeneth that the mela~colyke mater, 
which caused the dyseases, dothe auoyde 
[^f.30v^] 
out. But sumtymes it is an euyl 
token, for it sygnifyeth that either the 
blood is burned through excedi~g heat, 
or els that natural heate is clene que~ched 
through dedly colde, & therfore is 
it co~menly called a dedly signe, namely 
in sharpe Agues, if it haue an euyll sauour. 
And so meneth Galen, when he 
saith that he markyd: the thicker that 
a blacke water is, the worse it is: and 
more ouer: that he neuer saw any escape, 
which made soch vryne. And thus 
haue you herde of the significaitons of 
thynne & thycke vryne, with soch colours 
as may be conpylled therwith. 
Now wyll I wrytte a lytle of the coloures 
alone, & of soch tokens as cum 
chefely of them, rather then of the substau~ce 
or any other parte of the vrine. 
[/92./] 
The colours of vryn declare co~menly, 
how heate and colde do reygne in the 
body: so that the whyter the vryne is, 
the greater is the colde, and naturall 
heate the lesse: & the hygher coloured 
that the vryn is, y=e= greater is the hete. 
But to speke p~tyculerly, that you may 
[/93./] 
parceyne it the better. If the vryne be 
[^f.31r^] 
whyte, it is a sygne that co~coction sayleth 
quyte, & the lyghter coloured, the 
[/94./] 
worse. Pale colour is beter sumwhat, 
though if also declare lacke of natural 
heate & strenght. And flaxen coloure, 
[/95./] 
though it betoken beginnyng of concoction, 
yet is it not parfecte: how be it 
[/96./] 
it may be wel taken, if all other signes 
[/97./] 
be good. Palew and lyght safferne (as 
you haue herde before) are the best coloures, 
& most temperate, which betoke~ 
[/98./] 
exact concoction. But golden & saffre~ 
[/99./] 
colour declare excesse of heate. Claret 
[/100./] 
is nexte, & then red, after it crymsen, & 
[/101./] 
then purple, then greene, & last of them 
[/102./] 
is oyly vryne: which as they go in order, 
[/103./] 
so thei declare greater and greater 
[/104./] 
heate with increase, not onely of the 
[/105./] 
qualytie, but also of mater conteinyng 
the same. But now of the other syde: 
[/106./] 
blew vryne, & asshe colour, are tokens 
[/107./] 
of excessyue colde, sumtyme w=t= mater, & 
sumtime w=t=out: & so lyke ways of black 
vryne, how be it, it cu~meth sumtyme of 
excesse of hete. but how you may know 
the differences both of it, and all the 
other, now wyll I shew in order, 
with the rest of their sygnifycations. 
[^f.31v^] 
[/108./] 
Whyte vryne, if it cum in great quantytie 
in a hole ma~, it be tokeneth moche 
drinkyng of thynne wyne. But if it be 
meane in quantytie, with a due grou~d, 
it declareth colde dystemperau~ce of the 
lyuer. The vryne doth appere whyte, 
with a dyfforme and vnconcocted 
ground, in them that haue the dropsy. 
But in olde me~, whyte vryne is no gret 
euyll sygne, as you may parceyue by 
that I sayd before of Ages, how they 
alter vryne. But in yong men, & soche 
as ar of freshest age, it is a worse sygne 
and specially if it haue other no contentes, 
other els euyll contentes. And 
if vryne contynew long tyme whyte, 
without chaungeyng, it be tokeneth 
paynful beatyng of the head, daselling 
of the eyes, and gyddynesse, & also the 
fallyng euyll, lothsumnesse of good 
meates, and lustyng sumtyme after euyll 
meates, greedy hunger, payne in 
the lymmes, and paynfull mouyng of 
the sennowes, and dyuerse greefes of 
the head and raynes and also payne 
in the fundement, and great weakenes 
by syckenesse: for all these do follow 
[^f.32r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.34^] 
contynuall lacke of concoction, other 
colde, other stoppyng of the vaynes & 
isshewes, other transposyng of the humours. 
But y=e= differences of these can 
not easely be knowen of euery ma~ but 
soche as are lerned may gether certein 
dystinctions of them by the accyde~tes 
which follow dyseases. Darke whyte 
[/109./] 
coloures, as mylke whyte, whyte lytle 
[/110./] 
horne, and grey: If they appere in the 
[/111./] 
begynnyng of Agues & in the increase 
of them, they do betoken moch payn. 
But in the decrease of agues, they declare 
health, specially if it cum plentyfully. 
Pale vryne and flaxen doo not 
[/112./] 
lyghtly appere in Agues, excepte they 
be easy Agues, & shorte as those which 
contynew but one daye: but if that it 
do follow after burnyng Agues, it declareth 
that they be fully dyssolued. 
As for palew and lyght safferne, they 
[/113./] 
are (as I sayde before) the best & most 
parfecte colours, namely in yong men 
and fresh youth. But in olde men, women 
and chyldren (whose vryne, as I 
haue sayde, declyneth toward whyte & 
pale) it doth be token that their body is 
[^f.32v^] 
to hotte, other by reason of their dyett 
or els of their excersyce. But in as 
moch as it is but meane excesse, it declareth 
but small greife. Golden and 
[/114./] 
safferne coloured vryne, if it be other 
[/115./] 
sumwhat thynne, or very thycke, other 
it hath no grounde, or elles very few 
darke contentes. But in this they dyffer, 
that golden vryn declareth excesse 
of heate and mater also, by reason of 
meates, sharpe medicynes, chafyng of 
the blood thorow anger, heate of the bowels, 
or els heate of the tyme of the yere. 
But safferne colour appereth rather 
with defaulte of mater, thorough 
sum affection of the mynde, watchyng 
heate of the sonne, laboure, & soche lyke 
thi~ges, which encrease thynne & yellow 
choler, and dimynysh naturall heate, & 
that the cause of this colour is, choler itselfe 
increased other in quantytie, or els 
in qualytie. But in olde men, & women 
& soche other, there is sum greater cause 
that occasyoneth it, for it sygnifyeth a 
Ague cummyng of saffernly choler, dyspersed 
thorough the hole body: After 
which there followeth commenly, gyddynes, 
[^f.33r^] 
hed ache bitternes of the mouth 
lothsumnes of meate, thurstines. Also 
in yong men, soch vrine is caused 
thorough moch exercyse, & 
vse of hotte meates. 
 
[}Of claret and redde Vryne.}] 
 
CLaret and redd vrine is coloured other 
of the myxture of red choler, or 
els of the corruption of blood: soch vrine 
often tymes goeth before Agues. 
For whe~ the blood doth so abound that 
it can not be duly laboured, nor can take 
no ayer, there is engendred a certen 
corruption, which as it is red of colour 
it selfe, so it causeth the vryne to be red 
in colour, if it be moch, els it maketh 
onely claret colour. But if it be exacte 
red, lyke grayne, it be toketh that blood 
esshoweth into it out of sum vaynes 
nygh to the raynes, which other are 
broken, or other wayes opened. But 
how it may be knowen from whence it 
cummeth & how, there ar may meanes 
to serche: but bicause they ar not lyght 
to perceyue, I wyl reserue them for physicions 
that are learned. This colour 
[^f.33v^] 
of it selfe is no great euyll sygne, namely 
in yong men: for it betokeneth 
excesse of blood, whiche may well be 
borne of them. But in olde men it is a 
very euyll sygne for it betokeneth other 
long syckenesse, or els death: syth 
nature is so weke, that it can not kepe 
in hyr naturall humour. And if that 
redd coloure cum of redd choler, as it 
doth in yong men for the most parte, & 
not of blood (which thynge a lernyd 
Physicion may coniecture partely by 
the former dyete, & other sygnes mo) 
the accydentes shal be the moare troubelouse: 
how be it yet not so euyll, as 
when it cummeth of saferen or golden 
choler: for this causeth greter thurst & 
more troubelouse slepe, then the other. 
 
[}Of Crymsen colour}] 
 
CRymsen coloure is a token that the 
good humoures of the body ar burned, 
& turned vnto red or black choler, 
which cause worse grefes the~ y=e= other: 
howbeit if it haue a good ground, the 
grefe is the moare moderate. But if 
it haue other no coutentes for a space, 
[^f.34r^] 
or els euyll contentes, and the vryne 
appere lyke a thycke myste, but sumwhat 
glysterynge lyght, it is a sygne 
that nature nedeth moch strengthe to 
recouer her selfe to her owne state. 
 
Notwithstandyng soch vryne is caused 
sumtymes in hole folke, by reason 
of moch labour and longe iourneyng, 
& then it hath sum good sygnes therewith. 
But in them that haue a sharpe 
Ague, soch crymsen coloure of vryne 
doth betoke~, that corrupte blood doth 
abounde. and that it doth putrify and 
turne into choler. And commynly thei 
that make soch vryne, do thyrst moch 
and are drye in their mouth, and are 
troubyllyd in their slepe, & fele sharpe 
Agues, and ar halfe dystracte, and fele 
payne of the lyuer, with coughyng. 
 
Houbeit, yet these signes mai be su~tims 
as well good as bad, according as the 
colours do chau~ge, to better or worse. 
 
[}Of Purple colour.}] 
 
PUrple coloure declareth nede of 
moche strengthe before it can be altred 
to a good vryne. 
[^f.34v^] 
This vrin is a sygne of burned choler. 
And if it do contynew very long, it is a token 
of the yellow Iaunders, with abundaunce 
of grosse & corrupte choler, 
gathered in the lyuer. And at the beginning 
there goeth with it sum spices 
and grudgynges of the Ague, with a 
lytle thurstynesse: but vnlesse there be 
discretio~ vsed in y=e= dyete of soch a pacie~t 
it may turne to a moch worse disease. 
 
[}Of greene Vrines}] 
 
GRene coloure is an euyll & a daungerous 
token, for it nedeth not only 
long tyme, but also continual strength 
to brynge it a gayne too a trade 
The hygher that this coloure is, the 
more it declareth that choler excedeth 
the other humoures: which if it be any 
more burned, wyll cause blacke vryn 
of which I wyll a none speake. but 
grene colour cum of wasting of the fat, 
then is it sumwhat lyke to oyly colour 
or popyniay grene: but if it cum of abundaunce 
of purpellysh choler, and 
thorough increase of his qualytie, then 
doth the coloure inclyne more toward 
[^f.35r^] 
blacke, & glysterith with shadowy grene 
drawyng very nygh vnto blacke. 
 
After grene choler followeth madnes, 
parbrakyng and auoidyng of choler, 
sumtymes alone, & sumtimes with matter 
or els burned: and also contynuall 
thurstynesse and burnyng, heate of the 
tong, strayghtnesse about the stomake, 
and lyke other thynges. But if the pacyent 
contynew strong, and the coloure 
of the vryne do waxe lyghter, there is 
good hope, els there is great feare, lest 
of the drynesse and burnyng there doo 
folow contractio~ of the senowes, which 
wyll kyll the pacyent. 
 
[}Of oyly vryne of Popyngey greene}] 
 
OYly vryne is of .iij. sortes, as I seyd 
in the .v. chapiter. that is light oily. 
starke oylye and darke oylye. 
 
Oylye vrynes ar a token of vnnaturall 
heate, & the hygher that the colour is, 
the greater is the heate. And also they 
betoken moltyng of the fatte within a 
man, for of it are they so coloured. But 
at the beginnyng, when there is lyttle 
fatte molted, the vryne is lyght dylye, 
[^f.35v^] 
For if it loke starke oylye, then it sygnifieth 
that the disease increaseth. But 
if it cum ones to darke oily, then is the 
dysease sore increased. Hippocrates 
in the .vij. boke of his Aphorismys spekyng 
of fatnes in vryne, sayth thus: 
Who so maketh vryne with a fatye 
flottes cummyng moch and fast, they 
haue sharpe paynes in the raynes. 
 
Which sentence though it might seme 
more to appertayne to the contentes 
then to the colour, yet doth not only 
Galen but also Aeti~. Actuari~, & also 
an other grecya~ (whose name I know 
not) expou~d it amongest coloures: & by 
it declare the dyfference, to know whether 
that waste or moltyng of fatte be 
in the raines self, or in other partes of 
the body. For if it cum fast together, 
(as Hippocrates saith) then cu~meth it 
from the raynes self, & betokeneth the 
wastyngg to be in them. But if it cum 
softly & increse bi litle & litle, then doth 
it declare that y=e= hole body is ouercum 
w=t= vnnatural hete, & that y=e= fat of it doth 
wast: & doth betoke~ (as Act. witnesseth) 
a waslyng Ague, co~sumyng the body. 
 
[^f.36r^] 
[}Of Blew vryne, Asshcolour and Blacke.}] 
 
BLew colour, Asshecoloure & Blacke, 
do dyffer only in lyghtnesse & darkenesse. 
For asshecoloure is darker then 
blew: & blacke is darker then any of 
them both. Blew colour sumtyme cummeth 
of moderate melancholy, & then 
is the vryne sumwhat thynne in substaunce: 
& sumtyme it cu~meth of great 
colde, & then is it thicke in substaunce. 
And sumtyme it is a token of mortifyeng 
of sum parte. Yea, and sumtyme 
euen of hole nature: namely, if the colour 
chaunge to worse & worse, & there 
went before no token of concoction. 
 
Asshecoloured vryne cu~meth of lyke 
causes & be tokeneth lyke thi~ges howbeit 
it is so coloured many tymes, whe~ 
the partye that made it, hath ben sore 
bete~ & brused. But in this you nede not 
y=e= helpe of vrin, for you mai se y=e= waltes 
and tokens of the strypes in his body. 
 
Vryn which is extreme blacke, sumtyme 
be tokeneth extreme heate, & sumtyme 
extreme colde: the whiche both 
you may distynctely dyscerne, if you 
doo obserue order of alteration in the 
colours of the vryne that the pacyent 
[^f.36v^] 
made last before. For if his vryne before 
were greene, or lyke therto, then 
doth the blacke vryne which followeth 
it, be token extreme heate. But if it were 
last before blew or asshecoloured, then 
doth it sygnifye extreme colde. This 
blacke colour, though it be commenly 
an euyll and deadly sygne (as I sayde 
before, speakyng of thycke vryne and 
blacke) yet sumtyme it is a good token. 
 
For in all dyseases lyghtly that 
cum of mela~choly mater, it betokeneth, 
that the mater doth auoyde, and so the 
syckenesse to ende. And soch vrine doth 
appere many tymes, after purgations 
or other meates & dri~kes which purge 
the splene: namely if a man do laboure 
vpon them, and was before dysased of 
the splene. how be it, sumtyme meates 
and drinkes of lyke colour, cause black 
vryne, as Galene wytnesseth, namely 
after darke red wyne and Allegaunte. 
But in moderate Agues, if soch blacke 
vryne do appere, it is a token of death, 
excepte it be on sum crytycall dayes. 
And lyke ways in sharpe Agues, especially 
if the sauour be strong & stynki~g: 
[^f.37r^] 
vnles it cum of sum grefe of y=e= bladder. 
Let this suffyce for this tyme, as touchyng 
colours. Now for the quantitie 
[/116./] 
of vryn, as whe~ it is mene, it is a good 
token: so when it is other to moch other 
to lytle, it is an euyll sygne, except 
it cum of sum soch cause, as I shewed 
before, that altereth vryne in a healthfull 
man. As fyrst excessyue quantite 
[/117./] 
of vryne, cummeth of moch drinkyng 
of thinne wyne, as renysh wyne, & soch 
lyke, But that shall you thus knowe: 
for the colour wyll be whytelye, & the 
substaunce thynner then a meane, the 
contentes also wyll be dyuerse, & not 
duly knytte. Lykewyse if there be abundaunce 
of raw humoures in a ma~ 
vnconcocted, & yet nature perseueryng 
strong, then is there great quantytie 
of vryne, and sumwhat thynne of substau~ce, 
but not so whyte as that other, 
& the contentes of this are better. Also 
(as Hippocrates sayth) moche vryne 
[/118./] 
made in the nyght, is a token of small 
sege: so that it any impedyment lett 
naturall sege, then wyll the quantytie 
of vryne be the greater. But in this, 
[^f.37v^] 
as the colour is meane, so is the grou~d 
both greater & grosser. Yet in helthful 
folke may the vryn, by another menys 
also be greter the~ a meane: & that may 
be by medicyns which prouoke vryne. 
But then is the coloure more naturall 
then the last y=e= I spoke of, & the grou~de 
is thynner of substaunce: so that it is 
darke & scarsely sene, & then is there a 
certayne glysteryng in the vryne selfe.
