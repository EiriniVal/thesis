[^p.1^] 
[}A TRVE AND 
perfect Order to make Oiles 
out of all maner of Gummes, Spices, 
_[^ORIG. BLANK^]eedes, Rootes, and Hearbes. 
Whereunto is added some of 
their vertues, gathered out 
of sundry Authors.}] 
 
[}To make Oyle of Masticke.}] 
 
TAke the purest Masticke 
that may bee got which is 
not mixed with Sandrake 
or such like, and beate it 
to powder, then put it into 
a glasse with a long necke, and put therein 
as much pure aqua vitæ as will couer 
it three fingers high, and then stop it close 
that it take no ayre, then set it in warme 
horse dung, or in a soft Balneo, vntill it 
be dissolued: then poure it into a glasse, 
and put therein as much wine as you shal 
thinke good, and distil it with a head, and 
receiver in sand, with a small fire, and 
you shall receiue both oyle and water 
[^p.2^] 
togither, the which you shal separate one 
from another. Then increase your fire, 
and there will come foorth an other oyle 
which smelleth somewhat of the fire, and 
is best to be vsed outwardly. Ye may rectifie 
it againe with a small fire, and so it 
will come sweete. 
 
The vertues of this oile. It is excellent 
against all cold diseases of the maw: 
it comforteth the liuer and the lites, and 
all other inward partes of the bodie. Being 
drunken it helpeth those that vomite 
or spit bloud: it cousumeth and breaketh 
all inward sores. This oile being anointed, 
on the belly it stoppeth the flixe, it 
stoppeth womens termes, it is also good 
for the mother that is fallen downe, if 
you annoint it therewith, and the vnder 
parte of the bellie: it is good for young 
children whose arse-gut commeth foorth, 
if you annoynt it therewith, and put it 
vp againe: it is also good for those that 
are burst if you anoint them therewith, 
and let them weare a trusse fitte for that 
purpose.: it helpeth fresh woundes very 
quickly if you annoint them therewith, 
and lay thereon a cloth wet in the same. 
[^p.3^] 
It fasteneth the teeth if you annoint the 
gummes therewith: it comforteth a 
weake stomacke and causeth good disgestion 
if you annoynt it therewith. 
 
This oile hath all the vertues of Masticke, 
but it is a hundreth times more 
of force. 
 
[}To make oile of Mirræ.}] 
 
TAke pure Mirra that is new and fat, 
sixe ounces, and put it into a glasse 
with a long necke, and put thereon 12. 
ounces of pure rectified aqua vitæ, then 
lute the glasse fast, and sette it in horsedung 
vntill it be dissolued. Then poure 
it into an vrinall with a head and a receiuer, 
and distill away the aqua vitæ in 
Balneo, with a soft fire, and the oile wil 
remaine in the bottome, the which strain 
through a fine cloth, & keepe it in a glasse. 
His vertues are these. 
 
This oile by his naturall vertue preserueth 
all things from putrifaction that 
[^p.4^] 
is annointed therewith: likewise the face 
and hands being annointed therewith, it 
preserueth them in youthfull state, a long 
time. It helpeth all stinking sores and 
woundes quickely: it helpeth paines of 
the eares, if it be put therein. It preserueth 
the sight of the eyes, if you put one 
or twoo droppes therein. Helpeth all 
paines of the Mother if it bee annoynted 
therewith: it stayeth the haire from falling: 
if any be troubled with a Feuer, 
let him annoynt his whole body therewith, 
and laye him downe to sweate. 
This oile drieth and consnmeth all accidents 
after birth. Being drunke it maketh 
a sweete breath, and helpeth the 
cough, it is good against short winde: it 
helpeth the stitch in the side if you drinke 
thereof one dram: it stoppeth the fluxe of 
the belly: it maketh a cleane voyce. The 
arme-pittes being annointed therewith, 
it taketh awaye the stiuche from those 
partes: if ye mixe it with wine and wash 
the mouth therewith, it will comfort the 
gummes and fasten the teeth: it is also 
good for wounds in the head. 
 
If thou wilt vse this oile to preserue 
[^p.5^] 
any part, you shal vse it in this order, first 
make a bath with some sweete hearbes, 
and then hold that part the which you wil 
preserue ouer the fume, that the poares 
may open, then drie it with a linnen 
cloth, then annoynt it with this oile and 
chafe it in: that being done, if there remaine 
any yellownesse of the oile, yee 
may washe it away with white Wine. 
This oile would bee occupied when you 
are in the stew or hot house. 
 
[}To make Oyle of Storax liquida.}] 
 
TAke the purest Storax that you can 
get, and put it in a glasse, with a long 
necke, and set it in horse-dung for a moneth, 
then take it foorth and distil it in 
an Urinall that hath a wide mouth, in 
sand, with a gentle fire, & you shall haue 
both oile and water, the which you shall 
separate, and keepe to your vse. 
 
Risius writeth in his great booke of Distillations, 
that this oile hath the same 
vertues that the oile of Mirra hath: but 
that it is a little more hot and piercing. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}To make Oyle of Storax 
Calamite.}] 
 
THis oyle may be made diuers waies, 
of the which I wil shew you the best. 
Take the purest storax that you can find, 
And beate it into poulder, then put it into 
a long necked glasse, aud put thereon 
pure rectified aqua vitæ, and lute the 
glasse, then set it in warme dung, or 
in a soft Balneo a moneth. Then distill 
it in sande with a small fire, and thou 
shalt haue both oyle and water, which 
you shal separate. You shal vnderstand, 
that towardes the end of the distillation, 
there will ascend a certaine matter like 
Manna, the which is pleasant. 
 
The vertues of this oyle. Three or 
foure droppes being drunke, it comforts 
the breast and lungs, and all inwarde 
partes: it helps the paines of the mother 
if it be drunke, and also annoint these 
partes therewith: it stoppes the rheume 
that falles to the breast and necke: this 
being drunke, it makes a man mery, and 
[^p.7^] 
of light courage, but beware you take not 
too much. If you put twoo or three drops 
into the eares, it takes away the singing 
in them. 
 
[}To make Oyle of Beniamin.}] 
 
THis is made as you made the oyle of 
Storax Calamite, and is onely vsed in 
perfuming: some distill this Beniamin 
with rose water, but I thinke it wil not 
be so perfect in smell, nor so easily done. 
 
[}To make oyle of Galbanum.}] 
 
TAke the purest Galbanum thou canst 
get, and put it into a glasse, close luted, 
then set it in balneo Mariæ vntill it 
be dissolued, then distil it with a soft fire, 
and then will come foorth a fayre yellow 
oyle, the which ye shall separate. 
 
This oile being drunk, is good against 
an olde cough, and for such as are shorte 
winded, and can not easily drawe their 
[^p.8^] 
breath, but are alwaies panting & breathing. 
It is also verie good for such as 
are broken, and brused within, & against 
crampes, and shrinking of sinows. This 
oile being drunke in wine with oile of 
Mirra, is good against al venome drunken, 
or shotte into the bodie with venemous 
dartes or arrowes. Being taken 
in the same order, it prouoketh womens 
termes, and deliuereth the dead childe. 
It hath the same vertue, if a perfume 
thereof bee receiued in the secret partes. 
This perfume doeth also helpe women 
that are griued with the rising, or strangling 
of the Mother, and them that haue 
the falling sickenesse, and being layed 
to the nauell, it causeth the matrix or mother, 
that is remooued from his naturall 
place, to settle againe. This oile doeth 
mollifie and soften, and draweth foorth 
thornes, splinteres, or shiuers, and cold 
humours, being mixed with any conuenient 
vnguent. It is good to annoint the 
side against the stopping and hardnesse of 
the milt. The perfume or sent of this oile, 
driueth away Serpentes from the place 
where it is burned: and no venemous 
[^p.9^] 
beastes haue power to hurt suche, as bee 
annointed with the oile of Galbanum, and 
if ye mixe this oile with the roote of Angelica, 
or the seede or roote of Spandilium, 
and touch any Serpent or venemous 
beast therewith, it causeth them to die. 
 
[}To make Oile of Sagapenum.}] 
 
TAke this Gumme and dissolue it in 
strong Wine, in Balneo Mariæ, and 
then distill it in the Sand with a gentle 
fire. 
 
This Oile is good for the stitche in the 
side: It taketh awaie the cough that hath 
co~tinued long: It helpeth the swelling of 
the breast, wherby the breath is stopped. 
It is very good against the cramp: It warmeth 
the ioints, and helpeth the pains of 
the hips, and all such like diseases comming 
of cold. It is good for women that 
haue great paine in their childbed, if you 
annoint the nosethrils therewith: For it 
driueth forth both the quicke and the dead 
fruite quickly: beeing drunke with wine 
it helpeth against poison, & is also good against 
[^p.10^] 
the biting of an Adder: being put 
into the eie it taketh away spottes: You 
shal note, that women with childe must 
take great heede of this oile. 
 
[}To make Oile of Opoponax.}] 
 
THis is made as is aforesaid, and his 
vertues are these. 
 
If you drinke three or foure droppes 
with Wine, it helpeth the Cough and 
all impedimentes of the Milte: it helpeth 
also all impedimentes of the Blather, 
and clenseth it of all scabbes and 
sores: it helpeth the stitche in the side: it 
causeth speedie deliuery in women with 
childe: it helpeth against winde in the 
Matrixe, and dissolueth the hardnesse of 
those partes, and causeth the paine to 
cease. 
 
[}To make Oyle of Euphorbium.}] 
 
THis is made as is said afore, and his 
vertues are these. 
 
Ye shall note that this Oile is not to 
be occupied inwardly, by reason of his 
[^p.11^] 
great heate: except it bee mixed with 
some other thing, as if it bee mixed with 
honnie it purgeth the belly maruellously: 
it helpeth those that are troubled 
with obliuiousnesse, if yee annoint the 
partes therwith: it draweth forth thorns 
and such like out of the flesh: it helpeth 
the byting of an Adder: it is also good 
for stifnesse of the ioyntes comming of 
cold, if yee annoint the partes therewith. 
 
[}To make Oile of Ambre 
or Succinum.}] 
 
TAke Ambre and beate it to pouder, 
and put it into a glasse with a head 
and a receiuer, and distil it in sand with 
a gentle fire, and there will come forth 
both oile and water, the which ye shal separate 
one from another. 
 
This oile being perfectly distilled, is 
good against pains of the head, and resolution 
of sinews, and against swimming 
in the head, and falling sicknesse. If yee 
drinke thereof three or foure drops in the 
[^p.12^] 
morning with Pionie water, it preserueth 
a man from all poysons and pestiferous 
aires, if yee annoint the nosthrils 
therewith, or put it into some medicine 
fit for that purpose. It is excellent against 
diseases of the Blather and Raines, and 
driueth forth the stone, and prouoketh 
vrine, if yee drinke it with Malmesie, or 
Parcelie water, or such like. It helpeth 
the cholicke and choking of the Matrixs, 
if you also annoint the parts therewith. 
It driueth forth the fruite, and causeth a 
woman to be faire deliuered, if she drink 
three or foure drops, it is good against al 
fluxes of the head. 
 
[}To make oile of Amoniacum.}] 
 
TAke this Gumme and put it into a 
glasse, close luted; and set it in warme 
dung, or in Balneo Mariæ, vntill it be dissolued, 
then distil it in Sand with a head 
and a receiuer, and thou shalt haue both 
oile and water, the which yee shall separate 
one from another: yee shall vnderstand 
that there will come foorth more 
water then oile, as I haue prooued many 
times. 
 
[^p.13^] 
This oile helpeth the cough comming 
of moysture: it purgeth the breast, and 
helpeth Ulcers in that place, three or 
foure droppes being taken in an egge: it 
helpeth paines in the side, if ye annoint 
it therewith. It dissolueth all hardnesse 
and swellinges, and taketh away the 
paines of the goute. If ye mixe this oile 
with as much oile of Galbanum, and a verie 
little oile of Wormwood, and annoint 
the Milte, it taketh away all the paines: 
being mixed with oile of Wormwoode, 
and annointed in the Nauill it killeth 
wormes. 
 
[}To make Oile of Sarcocollæ.}] 
 
THis is an excellent Balsame against 
all woundes, and filleth them with 
fleshe: it purgeth all olde sores, without 
paine and smart, it breaketh hard impostumes, 
it helpeth all running eies, if you 
vse it in a Collirie: it helpeth wheales in 
the eie lids: Being drunk with wine it 
helpeth the rewme that falleth to y=e= teeth, 
& for that cause it is vsed of those that are 
[^p.14^] 
troubled with aboundance of flegmaticke 
humours: You shall note that this oile 
is specially vsed in freshe woundes and 
olde sores. This oile is made as you 
made the oile of Serapynum. 
 
[}To make oile of Castoreum.}] 
 
TAke the fattest that thou canst gette 
and stampe it well, then put it into 
a glasse, and set it to putrifie in Balneo 
Mariæ fiue or sixe daies, then distill it 
with a soft fire, and thou shalt haue an excellent 
oile. 
 
This is good against al cold Cramps 
and Palsies, being mixed with Rew and 
Vineger: and put into the nosethrilles it 
comforteth the braine, and taketh awaie 
paines of the head. Being annointed on y=e= 
neck and also drunke with Wine, it helpeth 
much those y=t= are troubled with the 
falling sicknesse: It helpeth convulsions 
and paines of the sinews, if you annoint 
them therwith: being drunk with pepper 
and Hidromell, it prouoketh womens 
termes and also the fruit, it warmeth cold 
[^p.15^] 
places, it is also excellent against Appoplexia, 
it helpeth those that are deafe, it 
mooueth venery. It helpeth the Chollick 
and the suffocation of the Matrixe, and 
strengtheneth the natural partes. 
 
[}To make Oile of Frankencense.}] 
 
TAke Frankencense as wuch as you will, 
and put it into a retorte of glasse, well 
luted: And put therunto for euery pound 
of stuffe, foure ounces of cleane Sand, 
and then distill it with a gentle fire, vntill 
all the substance be come foorth, and 
thou shalt haue both water and oile, the 
which ye must separate. 
 
The water is good against winde in 
the stomacke if it bee drunke: it is also 
good for choppes in the handes and feete, 
if yee washe them therewith, and annoint 
them with the oile against the fire, 
and straitwaies put on a paire of gloues, 
and so doing three times, they shall be 
whole. 
 
This oile helpeth simple woundes in 
three or foure daies, if yee annoint them 
therewith, and laie thereon a cloth wet 
[^p.16^] 
in the same, it preserueth all flesh from 
putrifying and alteration, and taketh away 
the paine: It helpeth all aches and 
bruses if ye annoint them therewith. Ye 
shall note that you must vse no tent 
where you occupie this oile, but wash the 
wound cleane and ioyne it or stitche it 
close togither, and then lay thereon a 
cloth wet in the same, for if ye fall a tenting, 
ye make worke for the Surgeon. 
 
[}To make Oile of Turpentine.}] 
 
TAke pure and cleane Turpentine as 
much as you will, and put it into a 
glasse, so that three partes be emptie, and 
put therein a certain quantitie of Sand, 
as much as you shall thinke good, then 
distill it in sand with a soft fire, and there 
will come forth foure licours: The one 
is a cleere water, the other a cleere oile, 
the third a yellow oile, the fourth a redde 
and stinking, the which a number of Poticaries 
doe sell in steed of Baulme: Yee 
shall note that the first oile is hote, the second 
hotter, the third hottest of all, and 
[^p.17^] 
not so good to occupie inwardly, as the 
first. 
 
Falopius in his book of secrets writeth, 
that this oile will helpe freshe woundes 
in foure and twentie houres, if yee annoint 
them therewith, and lay thereon 
a clothe wet in the same. It is good against 
contraction of sinews comming of 
cold: it prouoketh Urine, if ye drink one 
dram of the first Oile in white wine: it 
breaketh winde in the bodie, and dissolueth 
the Plurisie and Pestilent Feuer: 
it prouoketh an appetite if ye annoint the 
stomacke therewith. It helpeth against 
cold diseases of the Mawe, and helpeth a 
stincking breath, and the cough. 
 
[}To make Oile of Waxe.}] 
 
TAke new yellow Waxe as much as you 
shall thinke good, and melt it on the 
fire, then poure it into sweete Wine, 
and wring it betweene your handes, 
then melt it againe, and poure it into 
wine againe, and this you shall doe fiue 
or sixe times at the least, and euerie 
time you must haue fresh wine, then at 
[^p.18^] 
the last you shall put it into a retorte of 
glasse, wel luted with his receiuer, and 
distil it in Sand, and there will come 
forth a faire yellow Oyle, the which wil 
congele like pap when it is colde. Ye shal 
vnderstand that for euery pound of wax, 
yee shal put thereto foure ounces of the 
pouder of brickes into the glasse. 
 
Raymonde Lullie greatly commendeth 
this oile, approouing it rather to be a celestial 
or dinine medicine, then humain: 
for because this in wounds worketh most 
miraculously, which for his maruellous 
commoditie, is not so wel to be vsed of the 
common Chirurgion: Because this precious 
oile healeth a wound bee the same 
neuer so bigge or wide, being afore wide 
stitched vp, in the space of aleuen daies 
or twelue at the most: But those that are 
small this oile healeth in three or foure 
daies, by annointing onely the wounde 
therewith, and laying thereon a cloth 
wet in the same. 
 
Also for inward diseases this oile worketh 
miracles: For if you giue one dram 
at a time to drinke with white wine, it 
staieth the shedding of the haire, either on 
[^p.19^] 
the head or beard, by annointing the 
place therewith: Moreouer it is excellent 
in prouoking of vrine which is stopped: 
it helpeth stitches and pains in the loins, 
if you drinke the foresaid quantitie with 
white Wine: It helpeth the cold gout or 
Sciatica, and all other griefes comming 
of cold. Yee shall vnderstand, that if you 
rectifie this oile it wil congele no more, 
but then it will be too hote to take inwardly, 
for it pierceth meruellously, and 
is good to be mixed with other medicines 
to cause them to pierce the better, 
 
[}To make the Quintessence of Honey.}] 
 
YOu shall vnderstand that Honey is a 
licour rather diuine then humane, because 
it falleth from heaue~ vpon y=e= herbs, 
and is such a sweet thing, that the like can 
not bee found vppon the earth. And this 
Raymonde Lullie calleth the flower of flowers, 
because Bees gather it vppon the 
flowers in the field. And truly it is a most 
strange thing if wee would consider well 
[^p.20^] 
the qualitie of honey and waxe: and therfore 
the wise Baruch Arabico in the Academie 
of Auicene did write this sentence, 
Mel dentro, & olio di fuori, satisfying vs 
by this, that honey and oyle were the first 
two licours in the world. And truely it is 
so if we consider well, as it may well be 
prooued by holy Scripture. 
 
The order to make this Quintessence is 
thus. Take two pound of perfect pure 
honey, and put it into a great glasse, that 
foure partes of flue may remaine emptie: 
Lute it well with a head and receiner, 
and giue it fire vntill there appeare 
certaine white fumes, which you shall 
turn into water with wetting of clothes 
in cold water, and laying them on the receiuer, 
and head: and they will turne into 
water of a red colour like bloud. When 
it is al distilled, keep the glasse close shut, 
and let it stand til it be cleere, and in the 
colour of a Rubine. Then distil it in Balneo 
Mariæ at least six or seuen times, and 
so it will lose his red colour, and remaine 
in the colour of golde hauing a great 
smell, and so pleasaunt that the like cannot 
be found in the world. 
 
[^p.21^] 
This Quintessence dissolueth gold, and 
maketh it potable, and likewise any sort 
of Iewel that is put therin. It is of such 
vertue that if any be a dying, and drinke 
two or three drammes thereof, presently 
he wil recouer, as the Quintessence of wine 
wil doe. If you washe any wound therewith, 
or other sore, it wil heale quickly. 
It is also good against the Cough, Catarre, 
and paines of the Milte, and many 
other diseases which I wil not speake of: 
for but few, and they very hardly, wil beleeue 
the great vertue and operation 
thereof. 
 
I gaue this sixe and fortie daies vnto 
one that had the Palsie, and he was holpen. 
It helpeth also the falling sicknes, 
and preserueth the body from putrifaction, 
so that by these you may perceiue 
that it is a celestial medicine. If therefore 
anie vertuous man would take a little 
paine, in the experience heerof, hee 
shall doe woonderfull thinges, as manie 
times I haue done, so that the people 
deemed that I wrought by Inchauntment, 
when as indeede I did it 
by vertue of this licour, ministring the 
[^p.22^] 
same so priuily that they coulde not see 
it, which fell out to my great honour, and 
benefite of the sicke, as you shal reade in 
my Thesauro della vita humana. And therfore 
I woulde wishe them that professe 
phisicke, and Chirurgerie to vse such experience, 
whereby commeth honour and 
gaine to the Phisition, and profite to the 
patient. 
 
[}To make oile of Lignum vitæ 
or Guaicum.}] 
 
TAke the f_[^ORIG. BLANK^]eshest Wood that thou canst 
get, and make it in pouder, then put 
it into a vessell of glasse well luted, and 
set it in horse doung, or in Balneo to digest, 
then take it forth and distill it with 
a gentle fire, as thou wouldest distill 
Nutmegs, and thou shalt haue both oile 
and water, the which thou shalt separate 
by themselues: then take the feces and 
put it into a new earthen pot, and set it in 
a furnace of reuerberation, vntill it bee 
burnt into ashes, then take that ashes & 
make thereof a lye w=t= Fumetarie water, 
and when thou seest that the ashes will 
[^p.23^] 
make the water no more sharp, cast them 
away, and let the water settle cleer, then 
vapoure away the water with a soft fire, 
and in the bottome will remain a salt, the 
which you shall dissolue and congele vntill 
it be cleere, and faire, as Salatron or 
Entallie, then keepe it to thy vse: the water 
is to drinke with wine. 
 
The oile is to annoint the sores or aches, 
and the salt is to purge, and the order 
to vse it is thus: Either in the Poxe, 
Goute, or the Palsie. 
 
First you shall purge the patient well 
with this. Take of the salt half a scruple, 
Theriaca Alexandria two drammes, mixe 
them and giue them thereof halfe a scruple 
at a time: You shall giue this three 
or foure times, according to the infection 
of the disease, for in this salt is vertue 
to purge all humours that causeth 
the Goute, the Palsie and the Poxe, 
and such like hath not beene sound, neither 
by vomiting or purging, Then 
when the pacient is well purged, if 
the pacient haue anie sores or holes, 
you shall mundifie them with this 
salte, and when they are mundified, you 
[^p.24^] 
shall dresse them twise a day with the 
oile, vntil they be whole, but if the patient 
haue no holes, you shal annoint these 
places where hee feeleth ache or griefe: 
Also euery morning earely in his bed, and 
at night an houre after supper, you shall 
giue him a good spoonfull of the water 
with rennish wine to drinke, and let him 
sweate thereon well, also he shal vse this 
with his meate if he wil. Ye shal vnderstand 
that the cure lieth not in meate nor 
drinke, but in the medicine, and therfore 
keepe him not too hungry: but let him 
haue good meate and well seasoned with 
salt, and let him drinke wine, and so vsing 
this order, thou shalt be able to helpe the 
Goute, Poxe, or Palsie. 
 
[}To make Oile of Butter.}] 
 
TAke newe freshe Butter as much as 
you wil, and put it in a retorte of 
glasse, wel luted: and there will come 
forth three licours, the which thou must 
separate. 
 
This oile doth pearce maruellously, 
and taketh away the paines of the gout, 
[^p.25^] 
if you annoint them therwith: if you annoynt 
the handes and face therewith, it 
will preserue them faire: it is also good 
for those that are troubled with a Catarre, 
if you giue them thereof an ounce 
fasting, for presently it arriueth to the 
stomacke and mollifieth the Catarre, in 
such order as you shall spit it forth at the 
mouth. 
 
[}To make Oyle of egges.}] 
 
TAke egges and seethe them hard, then 
take forth the yelkes and stamp them 
in a morter, then put them in a frying 
panne, and set them ouer the fire, and 
continually stir them vntil you see them 
turne to oyle, then take them forth, and 
put them into a canuas bag and presse it 
foorth. This oile helpes woundes with 
great speed: it makes the hair of the head 
or beard blacke: it takes away the pains 
of the emerodes, it is excellent against 
burning with fire or scalding with water: 
you shall vnderstand this oyle may 
be made very perfect by the arte of distillation 
without impression, as I haue 
prooued diuers times. 
 
[^p.26^] 
[}Heere beginneth the order to make 
Oyles of all maner of Spices 
and Seedes.}] 
 
[}To make Oyle of Sinamon.}] 
 
TAke Synamon as much as 
you wil, and stamp it grosly: 
then put it into a glasse 
with pure aqua vitæ, and 
so let it stand fiue or sixe 
dayes, then distil it with a smal fire, and 
there wil come foorth both oyle and water, 
the which you shal separate one from 
another, for the oyle wil sincke to the bottome: 
some vse to distil this with wine, 
and some with rose water. 
 
You shal vnderstand that this oile is of 
a maruelous nature, for it pierceth thorow 
flesh and bones, and is very hot and 
drie, and is good against al cold and moist 
diseases, and in special for the heart and 
head, insomuch that if a man laie speechlesse, 
and could scant draw his winde, it 
[^p.27^] 
would presently recouer him againe, so 
that his time be not yet come: most miraculous 
to see: and to be short, this oyle is 
of such operation and vertu, that if a man 
drinke neuer so little, hee shal feele the 
working in his fingers and toes with 
great maruel: and therefore to be short, 
it pierceth through the whole body, and 
helpes al diseases that are come through 
cold and flegmatique matter. This oyle 
is hot and sharp: it digesteth and makes 
thyne, and driueth downe womens 
termes: it helps women that haue great 
pains and smart in their trauel, & brings 
forth their fruit, if you giue the pacient 
a little of this oyle, with oyle of Mirra in 
wine to drinke, and annoynt the partes 
therewith. The face and hands being annointed 
with this oyle, it driueth away 
the mesels and spottes. It warmeth the 
breast, & helps the cold cough: it co~sumes 
al cold fluxes that proceed from the brain 
and head, and causeth quiet sleepe. 
 
This oyle may be occupied in steede 
of _[^ORIG. BLANK^]he natural baulme for many diseases: 
ye shal note that the water of sinamon is 
al_[^ORIG. BLANK^]o good against the aforesaide diseases, 
[^p.28^] 
but yet nothing of so much force as the 
oile, for one drop of oyle will doe more, 
then foure spoonefuls of the water, therefore 
they would be vsed togither. 
 
[}To make oyle of Cloues.}] 
 
THis oyle is made in this order: Take 
the best Cloues thou canst get, and 
beate them grossely, then put them into 
pure wine into a glasse, with a long neck 
close luted, then set it in warme horsedung 
the space of a moneth, then distill it 
in sand with a soft fire, & thou shalt hau_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
a faire oile, which wil sincke to the bottome, 
the which you shall separate: and 
his vertues are these. 
 
It strengtheneth the braine, head, and 
heart, and reuiueth the spirites, it serueth 
against all colde diseases, it consumeth 
all euil fleugme: being outwardly 
applied, it hath great vertue in healing, 
and may be occupied in steede of baulme 
for woundes. One or two droppes taken 
in the morning with wine helpes a stinking 
breath: it makes the heart merrie, 
[^p.29^] 
and cleanseth the filthinesse thereof, and 
openeth the liuer that is stopped: being 
put into the eye it cleeres the sight: it 
comforts a colde stomacke, and causeth 
good digestion, it purgeth melancholie: 
this oyle may bee made in manus Christi 
with sugar, and they wil haue the aforesaide 
virtue and strength. 
 
[}To make Oyle of Nutmegs.}] 
 
THis oile is made as the oile of cloues, 
and will swimme vpon the wine: but 
if you distil this againe in Balneo, it will 
be most pure and suttle, and may be kept 
an hundreth yeers in his perfect strength 
and vertue. 
 
This oyle being drunke with wine 
driueth downe womens termes, and also 
the quicke and the dead fruit: and 
therefore women with childe shal not occupy 
this oyle, vntil such time as they be 
in trauel with childe, and then it causeth 
them to be faire deliuered without paine 
and danger: being drunke with wine it 
takes away all paines of the head comming 
[^p.30^] 
of colde: it comfortes the maw; and 
opens the lyuer, milt, and kidneys, and 
such like, it is excellent against beating 
of the heart, and faintnes and sounding, 
if ye drinke thereof and annoint the region 
of the heart therewith: it makes good 
blood, and expelleth flegmatike and melancholie 
humours, and makes a man 
merry: beeing vsed at night it takes away 
al fancies and dreames: if any had 
a wound, or had broken a ribbe within 
him with a fall, let him drinke this oyle 
with any slight wound drinke, and it 
wil helpe him although hee were almost 
dead: it is good in all filthie sores which 
are counted vncurable: it is also pretious 
for all cold diseases of the ioynts and sinews: 
it makes a sweete breath: if the 
splene doe swel, yee shall annoint therewith 
the left side: it helpes al effectes in 
the blather if it be drunke.

from the head: it comfortes the heart, the 
stomacke, and the womb, it is good in the 
strangurie, and all colde diseases: if yee 
drinke thereof three or foure droppes fasting 
with a spooneful of wine or broath, or 
eate twoo or three manus Christi made

[}To make Oyle of Pepper.}] 
 
THis oyle is distilled as is said afore, 
and is very cleere and light, and his 
vertues are these. 
 
This oyle hath more vertue then the 
pepper hath in piercing, and specially in 
the cholicke, and other weake places filled 
with flegme, if you take thereof three 
of foure droppes with one scruple of the 
iuyce of a Quince, two houres afore the 
fit, after the body is wel purged, and let 
blood, it stayeth also the shaking at the 
first time or else at the second, it taketh away 
the fit. 
 
Yee shall vnderstand that this oyle is 
only the ayrie part, separated from the other 
elementes. I sawe once this oyle 
[^p.32^] 
made of a Germane, which had the perf_[^ORIG. BLANK^]ct 
taste, sauour, and smell, and was so 
hot on the tongue as oyle of Uitriol. 
 
[}To make Oyle of Saffron.}] 
 
TAke the best saffron thou canst get, 
and put it into a glasse, and put thereon 
pure rectified aqua vitæ, then lute the 
glasse fast, and set it in warme horsedung

Mariæ with a soft fire, vntil al the aqua 
vitæ be come foorth: then take forth the 
saffron and presse it in a presse, made for 
that purpose, within a strong canuasse 
bagge, and you shall haue both oyle and 
water, which you shal disgest fiue or sixe 
dayes, aud then separate them by art. 
 
If this oyle be drunken with Wine it 
makes a man merrie, and to haue a faire 
color: if ye annoint the temples of a man 
ouercome with drinke it will helpe him. 
This oyle being annoynted on S. Anthonies 
fire it quencheth it, & preserues 
the place: this oyle being mixed with womens 
milke stoppeth the running of the 
[^p.33^] 
eyes: being annoynted on the heart it 
maketh it merry. The head being annoynted 
with this oyle it prouokes sleep, 
by reason whereof the auntient doctors 
heretofore did vse it to such as were mad, 
annoynting the temples therewith: it 
cleanseth olde sores. 
 
[}To make Oile of Anniseede.}] 
 
TAke as much Anniseede as thou wilt, 
and beate it grosly, then infuse it in 
strong wine foure or fiue dayes, and distil 
it in a gourd with a head and receiuer, in

THis is made as is aforesaide, and his 
vertues are these. It is most excellent 
against all paines of the eyes, insomuch 
that if a man were almost blinde it 
woulde recouer his sight againe, if hee 
drinke thereof once a day, and dropp one 
drop into the eye morning and euening: 
it maketh a sweete breath, and comforts

This oyle as writeth Euonimus, breaketh 
the stone in the reines, and prouoketh 
menstrue and vrine: it comforteth

oyle may be made in manus Christi, with 
sugar, and is very pleasant, and hath the 
selfe same vertue. 
 
[}To make oyle of Cumin seede.}] 
 
THis oyle is made as is aforesaide, and 
is good against woundes that pierce 
the splene: it is also most excellent to 
scatter and breake all the windinesse of 
the stomacke, the belly, the bowels and 
matrixe: also it is singular against gryping 
torments, and gnawings or frettings 
of the belly, nat only to be vsed inwardly, 
but to be put into glisters, or to 
be layed to outwardly with barly meals. 
This oyle being drunke with wine, is 
good for those that are hurt with any venemous 
[^p.36^] 
beasts: this oyle either eaten in 
Manus Christi, or drunke is very profitable 
for such as haue the cough and haue 
taken colde, and for those whose breasts 
are charged or stopped. This oile being 
too much vsed, decayeth the naturall complexion 
and liuely colour, causing one to 
looke wanne and pale. 
 
[}To make oile of Carraway seede.}] 
 
THis oyle is made in the aforesaid order, 
and is very good and conuenient 
for the stomacke, and for the mouth: it 
helpeth disgestion, and prouoketh vrine:

And to conclude, it is answerable to the 
oyle of annis seede, in vertue and operation.

profitable against the suffocation or

in manus Christi staieth the yexe or hiquet. 
 
This oyle healeth hollow and moyst 
vlcers, and especially in the share or priuy 
partes, this oyle doth digest and resolue

rawe and vnripe humours. This oyle 
may not be too much vsed inwardly, for it 
diminisheth the sight and the seede of generation.

[}To make Oyle of Rew or Herbgrace.}] 
 
THis oyle is made of the seede of Rew 
being putrified in wine. 
 
Cardanus writeth that this oyle being 
perfectly made, is of great vertue against 
poyson being drunke with wine, for it 
causeth the pacient to auoyd it by vomit, 
at the first time he taketh it: and at the 
second time it expelleth the other euil humours 
that are infected therewith: and 
at the third tim it cureth the pacient and 
maketh him whole: and this is done in 
three or foure dayes: it helpeth also all 
diseases of the eyes, of what cause soeuer 
it be, so that the apple of the eye be not 
perished. The vse of this oyle to the eye 
is to annoynt it therewith twice a day, 
or wash the eye with the water of Rew, 
[^p.39^] 
and droppe one or two droppes into the 
eye. 
 
This oyle being drunke, suffereth no 
poyson to remayne in man that day: if a 
man drinke thereof fasting which is sore 
wounded. and that the other cure be had 
accordingly he shall easily escape. This 
oyle being drunke taketh away the gout 
and dropsie sprung of a cold cause: it restores 
al nummed members taken with 
the palsie if you annoynt them therewith. 
 
Cardanus also affirmeth in his second 
booke de Subtilitate, that there are certain 
poysons which slay with their onely touching, 
against which poyson saith be, the 
best remedy is, not to tarry in any place 
vntill thy hand waxe hot, but often bathe 
the partes with warme water, and annoynt 
them with oyle of Rew perfectly 
distilled.

a hundreth times more purer and more 
piersing, for I haue seene those that could 
[^p.41^] 
not make water in three or foure daies: & 
after thei haue drunk 4 or 5 drops of this 
oile, and annointed therewith the region 
of the bladder, presently they haue 
made water without any tarrying. 
 
This oile is so exellent against the pestilence, 
that if any drinke thereof oftentimes, 
he shall not be infected: although 
he were in the house where the Pestilence

drops in Wine and lay him downe to 
sweate, and the next day hee shalbe well 
againe:
