of the Moon.}] 
 
THe Ancient doth say, that when the weather is 
extreme hot or cold, it is not good to purge, or to 
let blood, unlesse that some great necessity require it: 
And therefore Hippocrates part. 4. Aphor. 5. Sub canicula, 
& ante cameulam, difficiles sunt Purgationes: 
Purgations and the administration of Physick are 
dangerous about the Dog-dayes. And again, Part. 4. 
Aphor. 4. Æstate suam naturam servante, superiorem potius; 
Hyeme inferiorem purgare convenit. By which 
we understand, that if necessity urge to take Physick 
in Summer, it ought to be by Uomit; but in Winter 
by Purgations. 
 
The fittest times to take Physick by Purgations 
(as the Astrologers say) are to be elected according to 
the motion of the Moon in watery Signes: Therefore 
Hermes in the 74 of his Centilo, Luna existente in 
Signis ruminantibus, vel conjuncta Planetæ retrogrado, 
non est bonum Purgationibus uti: Let not (sayes he) 
the Moon be in Signes that chew the cud (in giving 
purging medicines) as Aries, Taurus, and Capricornus, 
or joyned to a Planet that is retrograde, for it 
will cause Uomit, &c. 
 
And likewise Ptolomy in the 19 of his Centilo, Si 
quis Purgatorium acceperit Luna cum Jove existente, abbreviabitur 
ejus opus, & affectum ipsius minuetur.

And concerning blood-letting, although some (more 
precise then wise) will not give consent to let blood 
when the Moon is in a Signe that governs that part 
in which the vein is to be opened; yet if there be a continuall 
burning Ague, the Pestilence, a Plurisie, 
Phrensie, Squinancy, or great Head-ach, proceeding 
of choler, or hot superfluous blood, or any extreme pain 
caused by heat or choler; in any of these cases a man 
may not tarry for a chosen day, but must open a vein 
immediately, if the strength of the Patient will 
permit. 
 
Let blood for young persons from the Change to 
the first Quarter. 
 
For them of middle age, from the first Quarter to 
the Full.
