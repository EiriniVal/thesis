[}The Historie of Life 
and Death.}] 
 
[}The Entrance.}] 
 
THere is an old complaint 
of the shortnesse 
of life, and tediousnesse of 
Art. Therefore it seems very 
fitting to us, who strive to 
the uttermost of our powers 
to make Arts perfect, to take 
care also of prolonging the 
Life of man, the Author of 
Life and Truth assisting us 
therein. For although mens 
lives be nothing else, but an 
increase and accumulation of 
[^p.208^] 
sinnes and miseries; and that 
life is but of small advantage 
to those who aspire to Eternity: 
Yet we who are Christians 
should not contemne or 
despise a continuation of 
works of Charity. And the 
beloved Disciple lived l_[^ORIG. BLANK^]nger 
than any of the rest; and many 
of the Fathers, especially 
the holy Monkes and Hermites, 
were long lived. And 
there was lesse taken away 
from this blessing, (so often 
made mention of in the old 
Law), than from any other 
earthly blessing, after the coming 
of our Savior. But it is plain 
and manifest enough, that this 
is held for to be a great good; 
but how to attaine thereunto, 
is a high and mysterious question; 
and so much the more, 
because it hath been abused 
both by false opinions and false 
Præconiums, For those things 
which are commonly spoken 
of by the Rabble of Physicians, 
[^p.209^] 
concerning the Radicall 
Humour, and Naturall Heat, 
are deceitfull. And the immoderate 
praises of Chymical 
Medicines, first swell men up 
with hopes, and then forsake 
them, and leave them in the 
mire. Neither is our Inquisition 
now of that death 
which proceeds from suffocation, 
putrifaction, and 
divers other Diseases; for 
that belongs to a Physicall 
or Medicinall Historie; but 
of that Death onely which 
comes by the Resolution 
and consumption of old 
age. Yet to enquire of the 
last passage or step to death, 
and the very extinction or 
putting out of life, which may 
be done by many, both internall 
and externall ways (which 
notwithstanding have as it 
were one and the selfe same 
place of habitation, before we 
come unto the very pangs of 
death.) I beleeve hath some 
[^p.210^] 
affinity with our present Inquisition, 
but we will set that 
in the last place. That which 
may be repaired by degrees 
and without destruction, the 
primary entire thing, that in 
potentia is eternall as the Vestall 
fire. Wherefore when 
the Philosophers and Physicians 
saw, that creatures were 
nourished, and that their bodies 
were repaired and made 
up againe; yet that it could 
not last long, but that a while 
after they grew old, and dyed; 
they sought for death in 
some thing, which properly 
could not be repaired, thinking 
that some Radicall and 
first engendred Humor is not 
totally repaired, but that there 
is even from the infancy some 
degenerate addition, and not 
a precise, solid and just reparation, 
which by degrees is 
depraved with age, and at last 
brings that which is depraved 
to nothing. These unskilfull 
[^p.211^] 
and erroneous opinions they 
hold. For all things in youth 
and young age are fully and 
wholly repaired, and for a 
time increase in quantity, and 
are bettered in quality: so that 
the matter of Reparation 
might in a manner be eternall, 
if the meanes of Reparation 
did not fall away. But indeed 
in a declining age, there is 
but a very unequall Reparation 
made. In some parts Reparation 
proceeds happily, 
and other parts grow worse 
and worse; and from that time 
men begin to endure that torment 
which Mezientius did 
use to inflict, namely to kill living 
men with the embraces 
of dead [^ORIG. BLURRED^] and those things 
which might easily be repaired 
doe faile by being joyned 
to those things which can 
hardly be repaired. For even 
after that men do begin to decline 
through age, their Spirit, 
Bloud, Flesh, and Fat may easily 
[^p.212^] 
be repaired; but those 
parts which are more Porous, 
all Membranes and Tunicles, 
Nerves, Arteries, Veins, 
Bones, Cartilages, most part 
of the Inwards, and finally 
almost all the Organicall 
parts, are difficultly, and with 
great losse repaired. And 
those parts being to assist the 
reparation of those Repareable 
parts which are actually 
to be repaired, losing their 
activity and strength, can no 
longer performe their functions. 
And from thence a 
while after proceeds the falling 
to ruine of all together, 
and those very same parts, 
which in their owne Nature 
are very Reparable, the Organs 
of Reparation failing 
cannot be well repaired, but 
decrease, and at last totally fail. 
And the cause of the Period 
is, because the spirit preying 
alwayes like a still and gentle 
Flame, the externall aire 
[^p.213^] 
(which also sucks and dries up 
the bodies) conspiring with it, 
at the last ruines the frame of 
the body and its Organs, and 
makes them unable to performe 
the act of Reparation. 
And these are the true wayes 
of Naturall Death, which are 
carefully to be revolved in 
mans mind. For he that knows 
not the wayes of Nature, how 
can he obviate and turn them? 
Therefore there ought to be 
a double Inquisition: one of 
the Consumption, or Depredation 
of the body of man; 
and the other of the Reparation 
or Refection of the same. 
And with this proviso or Caveat 
that the one may be inhibited 
and restrained, and the 
other promoted and comforted 
as much as may be: and 
the first of these belongs chief_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
to the spirits and internall 
aire, by which the Depreda_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
and waste is made; the second 
to the whole processe of 
[^p.214^] 
alimentation, which causeth 
the Restitution. And as for 
the first part of the Inquisition, 
which is of the Consumption, 
that is for a great part 
common to inanimate bodies: 
For those things which the inbred 
spirit (which is in all 
Tangible things be they living 
or dead) and the encompassing 
Aire, do operate upon 
inanimate things, the same 
they doe also attempt upon 
those things which are animate 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] though the Vitall 
which is added unto them, 
partly breaks and quels these 
operations, and partly doth 
most powerfully increase and 
augment them. For it is most 
manifest, that many inanimate 
things can last a long time 
without any Reparation; 
whereas animate things doe 
presently fill and [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] without [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
Reparation, as the [^ORIG. BLURRED^]. 
Therefore there ought to be 
[^p.215^] 
a double Inquisition: First, 
Contemplating mans body, 
as Inanimate, and without Aliment: 
Then as it is Animate 
and Alimented. And having 
spoken thus much by way of 
Preface, let us now proceed 
to the Topicks of the Inquisition; 
concerning which you 
must read the History of Life 
and Death.
