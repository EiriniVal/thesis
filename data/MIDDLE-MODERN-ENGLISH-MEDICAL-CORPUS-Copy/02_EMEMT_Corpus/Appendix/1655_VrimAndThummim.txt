[}WHETHER 
The Vrim & Thummim 
Were given in the 
MOUNT, 
Or perfected by 
ART.}] 
 
THe clear Vision 
of an Essence, 
causeth men to 
glorifie God, 
who hath given 
power unto man, 
to manifest his eternal 
purpose of renovation of 
[^p.2^] 
the creature by a natural operation: 
and although the true and 
natural essences of things are seldom 
manifestly known by themselves, 
yet humane learning, being 
as a sickle, whereby we reap divine 
knowledge, directs us to the mark; 
and the Philosophers all agree, Essences 
are bright, pure, and clear, 
confused in the creature, and may 
be purified, but the manner is not 
easily agreed, so that they lead 
us to the consideration of several 
Arts, and of natural and Artificial 
things, jointly and severally: some 
Arts have their termination in silence, 
as Rhetorick and Pleadings: 
others have their perfection upon 
the Superficies, as painting and 
carving: But the true Alchymist 
exludes all vulgar operations to 
extract the internal beauty; and 
there are three kinds of labourers 
in this Art, Alchymistæ, Lauchymistæ, 
Lachrymistæ; yet no Art 
may justly be condemned for the 
fault of the Professors. For Albertus 
Magnus saith, Hoc artificium 
[^p.3^] 
omni arte certius ac sublimius est, & 
certissimum habet effectum. They 
name their Matter Adam, because 
from red earth he became the salt 
and light of the world, so onely 
man, and their corporate lights, are 
called Microcosmus: therefore 
they consider wisdome in a created 
nature, as well subject to sense 
as invisible, and consequently material, 
because quality is as the matter 
of the Elements, and the central 
vertue is real, and may be specificate; 
neither is it contrary to 
nature, but beyond nature, that the 
true sense, and lively practice make 
one perfection. The Philosophers 
say, Whosoever hath their mystery, 
knows the thing in being, and 
in being and use before practice, 
and each for himself affirms: I write 
nothing, save that I have seen and 
done, not have I done any thing, 
save that I knew before. Although 
that which is hid, is more than can 
be spoken, yet their whole intent 
is to manifest that which is hid, 
and to hide that which is manifest, 
[^p.4^] 
therefore they conclude: Felix 
scientia cum sciente, and the holy 
Text saith, God giveth wisdome to 
the wise, and knowledge to them that 
[/1./] 
know understanding. But because 
the question stands betwixt divine 
tradition, and natural disposition, 
we must look to the beginning, 
when the eternal Word commanded, 
[/2./] 
and it was made: but in the 
Generation of Heaven and Earth, 
there is inserted a power of the 
perpetuation of Creation, wherein 
Vrim & Thummim are created remotis 
[/3./] 
sima. For albeit the visible 
onely are mentioned, yet the invisible 
are understood, and difference 
taken betwixt things instituted 
without means, and those produced 
by help of mean subjects. 
For Almighty God is not said to 
rest, as if he had travelled in his 
work, but because he created no 
[/4./] 
more any new kind of Creatures, 
than by the power of the word Fiat; 
Therefore not the Vrim & 
Thummim, save as they subsisted 
in other things like Misseltoe, which 
[^p.5^] 
hath body, branch, and berry, 
yet noroot of it self. But if we remember 
the things of old, we may 
declare these last from the first: 
[/5./] 
For from the end of every intention 
springs the beginning, and the 
wisdom of God hath ordained diversity, 
but his power maketh all 
things equall, and thereby is manifested 
the eternal beauty. The 
Vrim & Thummim were substances; 
for Moses put them into the 
breast-plate, the words signifie 
light and perfection, Knowledge 
and holiness, manifestation and 
[/6./] 
truth, so the sense and substance 
doth predicate each other, as the 
convertible terms of Science and 
Essence make one perfection, and 
the substances were bright and 
perfect: also joint and several, because 
none can come to perfection 
without knowledge, and 
where the Almighty God appointed 
the end, he gives the means to deliver 
the Creature from the bondage 
of the Elements. Wisdome, 
Understanding and Knowledge, 
[^p.6^] 
are the means to attain them, and 
the gifts of grace are signified by 
them also. The Philosophers call 
the manifestation of the centrall 
vertue, Donum Dei, In their sacred 
use they were objective to 
the golden Cherubims, whose wings 
were stretched to the outmost side 
of the Temple, they signified the 
plenitude of Science, which hath 
identity with Essence; there was 
also the scarlet vail, which seemed 
[/7./] 
ever moving, and signified pure 
fire generative, and moving, which 
selected and fixed in clear bodies, 
is Urim & Thummim. For when 
the four spirits of the heavens proceed 
from the Lord of all the 
Earth, and were fixed in the 
North, then take silver and gold, 
and make crowns. There is a spiritual 
and natural use of these 
[/8./] 
things, the Creator by his absolute 
power, may make children of 
stones, but his ordinary power requires 
means; and because the insensible 
things should make his love 
to man more apparent; he commandeth 
[^p.7^] 
the Ark of Noah, and 
the Ark of the Testimony, to be 
made after the proportion of mans 
body, the length six times the 
[/9./] 
breadth, and ten times the thickness; 
in which numbers are contained 
all perfections. Yet is objected, 
they were not commanded 
[/10./] 
to be made, but to be put into the 
breast-plate. The great and glorious 
works of God are not unknown 
unto himself, but unto us, 
they are by present command, or by 
successive course, as the first fruits 
were supernatural; and again, the 
trees brought forth the same year, 
according to their natural course 
and perfection: also the word Essence, 
containeth the natural & spiritual 
condition of bodies, which 
are so fast connexed, that the true 
and natural Essence, is with great 
difficulty made apparent, although 
the matter be but as a light case to 
the form: In generation it moves 
a non ente ad ens, in corruption it 
moves ab ente actu ad non ens. Also 
some things have existence by the 
[^p.8^] 
subject, which have no Essence in 
nature, neither are said to be created, 
as darkness, and silence, and 
things of putrefactive kind. So in 
the putrefaction of the Creature, 
that is not properly said to be 
made, which by an inward power 
doth purge it self by ebullition, and 
a kind of new generation, as doth 
the pure sulphur of Metal, the Artist 
being but as a Mid-wife; so that 
there is a necessary difference betwixt 
that which hath being by the 
power of Gods work, and the 
work of man; for no effect is said 
to be necessary from the first and 
remote causes, but from the second 
and neerer; as in the spiritual 
[/11./] 
operation in man, the work of 
Righteousness is peace, and the 
effect, quietness and assurance for 
ever. Also taking away Evening 
and Morning, which is mixed 
knowledge, the light of the seven 
dayes shall be a perpetual blessing, 
and perfect knowledge. Now to 
descend again to the Philosophers, 
Morien Remanus saith, secretum 
[^p.9^] 
secretorum est illa dispositio, qua manibus 
perfici non potest. Hæc enim dispositio 
est naturarum mutatio. Another 
saith, Ars ergo postcontemplationem 
omnium horarum sequitur naturam, 
& recipit spiritus natura immundos, 
& eos sublimando subluerat & mundat, 
& tunc volendo fugere ab igne, 
ars ministrat naturas & natura cos 
convertit in corpora munda fixa, & 
de cæteris natura corporum dominabitur 
naturæ spirituum in æternum, 
per hoc ingenium mirabile. Bezaleel 
had the spirit of wisdom, understanding 
[/12./] 
and knowledge, which are 
the means to attain this effect, and 
his ends directed to devise works 
in gold, silver and brass, which 
although in sound of words they 
seem inferiour, yet they are in exaltations 
in Art progressive to the 
producing of Vrim & Thummim: 
For all the glorious furniture of 
the Tabernacle was not for worldly 
pomp, but for spiritual mysterie 
and beauty of the Doctrine of 
the Law, and the Gospel: so in 
natural things, there is no greater 
[^p.10^] 
mysterie than that the incorrupted 
quality of pure sulphur, should 
have regal power and rest, eternally 
visible, shining as the Sun in 
glory. As a man is chiefest of 
the Creatures, so gold is purest of 
bodies, Lord of stones, and noblest 
of Metals, which one cals secretum 
magnum Dei, and another saith, ille 
spiritus in Auro idem est cum spiritu 
generante omnium creaturarum: 
est que eadem unica generativa natura 
per omnia diffusa. And as the Sun 
is chiefest amongst celestial bodies, 
so his spirit doth raign over the 
fourfold nature, and being corporate 
is without shadow. One of 
the Rabbins saith, in the second 
Temple they made Urim & Thummim, 
therefore that which hath 
been done, may be done, although 
the materials be concealed. For 
good in a better, is even more excellent; 
but if Phidias gave him 
[/13./] 
rude and obstinate stuff to carve, 
let his art do what it can, his work 
will want the beauty. And because 
nature her self cannot attain her 
[^p.11^] 
highest perfection, the Artist must 
break the gates of brass, and cut in 
pieces the barres of iron, that is 
ignorance, and the matter of the 
Elements, whereby the treasures of 
darkness, and incorporeal substances 
are hidden from us, but being 
removed, the invisible Essence is 
[/14./] 
apparent, as the chariots of fire about 
Elisha. These Rabbins also 
hold every natural beginning to 
be either matter, or the cause of 
matter, viz. The four Elements 
sub nutus Dei, which they express in 
Numbers and figures, for number 
is Unity folded up, and Unity is 
number unfolded. The Mathematical 
number is collected of many 
Unites, as a line of many points; 
And number is said to be formed, 
and material signifying Principia 
& Elementa, because vocabulum 
naturale est symbolum numeri, which 
is expressed in the setting of the 
precious stones four rowes, three 
in a row, four to shew the natural 
[/15./] 
perfection, and three the inward 
generation; as three and four the 
[^p.12^] 
artificial exaltation. for these natural 
bodies do not shew forth 
[/16./] 
their vertues, until they be made 
spiritual; the precious stones signified 
the excellency of gifts in 
the Teachers, and the Vrim & 
Thummim the gifts of grace in 
the heart; because the central vertues 
are their materials, quia virtutes 
formant ad speciem. In things 
of greatest concordance are 
greatest vertues; for that which is 
most abundant in vertue, doth 
most excel in glory and beauty: 
Bezaliel hath the spirit of knowledge 
to devise works in gold, 
therefore his invention must necessarily 
consider the possibility from 
the object, and how to work upon 
the form, as well as upon the matter, 
and upon the center as upon the 
superficies: For seeing the perfection 
of the matter is glorious, the 
perfection of the form must necessarily 
be more glorious; because 
the bodily nature shall eternally 
predominate: In the Creation the 
substance of the Sun was light corporate 
[^p.13^] 
the fourth day, light is never 
without heat, and radical heat 
is the occultum corporis, which augmented 
and fixed, shines as the 
Sun in glory, which shews the 
majesty of nature as in a liquid 
[/17./] 
glass; notwithstanding, that which 
is sowed is not quickned, except it 
die, and it is a rule amongst the 
Philosophers: Ad perfectionem omnium 
Artium requiritur renascentia. 
To like purpose another saith: Corpus 
ad omnes perforandas miserias est 
ordinatum. Oportet enim transire per 
ignem & aquam & renasci, aliter in 
requiem eternam ingredi non poterit. 
And another saith, Post resurrectionem 
habemus gloriam & fortitudinem 
sempiternam tunc gaudebunt omnes 
in prosperitate magna~ qui sciunt 
nostrum progressum. So the end of 
every intention shews the beginning, 
the Creatures were made 
perfect, and to be perfect: for the 
formal and final cause is the same, 
the difference is in the perfections. 
Some hold that the ancient Philosophers 
by this holy art have become 
[^p.14^] 
Prophets: And because Adam 
his dominion of the creatures 
was the knowledge of their natures 
and Properties, by this Science he 
knew the world should be twice 
destroyed: For both fire and water 
are necessarily required to the 
purification of the creature. And 
as sense is the light of nature, so 
reason is the perfection of sence, & 
by example we see with others eys, 
but by reason with our own. Notwithstanding 
we may consider Tubal-Cain, 
who was an instructer of 
[/18./] 
every Artificer in brass and iron, 
that is (saith the Philosopher) a 
perfect Master in the decoction of 
Mineral vertue, which Dæmogerger 
calleth ferrum. Et Aurora consurgens 
hath these words: Ego sum 
ferrum siccum & durum & forte, 
pistans & pistatum omne bonum: Et 
non est res mundi agens actionem meam. 
Per me enim generatur secretum 
secretorum, quando convalesco 
a~ languiribus, tunc habeo vitam leonis 
rugientis, & c. Etiam Raym Lullius, 
Absque ferro homines suam vitam 
[^p.15^] 
sustentare non posse: Iterum Ferrum 
potest quod aurum non potest, seipsum 
mortificat, seipsum vivificat, seipsum 
rubore decorat. And this operative 
spirit is the regal sulphur, 
which questioneth in Marlin his 
Allegory. Where are mine enemies 
that would not that I should raign 
over them? bring them hither, that 
I may slay them. The Antimonial 
and Arsenical spirits must be vanquished, 
for onely to the benign, 
gentle, and most suffering Mercurial 
spirit is given absolute victory: 
Lux sata est justo, &c. Therefore 
sow light, and reap perfection, sow 
[/19./] 
gold, and reap the internal beauty. 
Notwithstanding the Philosophers 
work is not upon gold, no more 
than a man doth ride upon a block, 
because he mounts a great horse by 
it: but their is use of it. And one 
saith, gold is dissolved by wisdom, 
therefore in the power of Art to 
better, yet the fast locked body 
must not only be made relative, and 
the exterior form destroyed, but 
from the crude nature, and confused 
[^p.16^] 
substance doth naturally arise, 
a subtil white fume, which is said to 
be vita quædam unica omnia replens, 
colligans & connectens, that is, aqua 
clarissima putrefactionis, and being 
corporated is clear as a Crystal 
looking glass, and then called ens 
enti admixtum essentia composita & 
Urim, also by help of the same pure 
body (save that forma ex materia 
non nascitur) is produced a more 
perfect substance brighter than a 
carbuncle, giving sufficient light to 
read by, which is called essentia simplex, 
ens omnis privationis expers & 
Thummim. For the creature shall 
[/20./] 
be delivered from the bondage of 
corruption, unto a glorious liberty, 
and the animality being changed 
into spirituality, the corporal and 
spiritual vertues are eternally fixed. 
[/21./] 
Some hold a glorified body shall 
be like a Chrystal Lanthorn, with 
[/22./] 
a taper in it, and like them men 
shall differ in glory. Certainly the 
wise shall shine like the brightness 
of the firmament, and the Creator 
hath given power to men to manifest 
[^p.17^] 
the redintegration of the 
world, by a lineary and successive 
course in short time, which himself 
shall make apparent, when 
time shall cease. But de entibus a~ 
fortuna non potest esse veritas, nec 
scientia: Also we must specially 
remember onely the homogeneal 
nature, is capable of so high excellence, 
which Bezaleel did work 
upon, and hath the spirit of knowledge, 
which word in the original, 
[/23./] 
is used for sense and experience, 
and he made all the Lord 
[/24./] 
commanded Moses, who might 
make nothing, save that he hath 
seen a pattern of in the Mount. 
Therefore Bezaleel was at least equal 
to those of the second Temple, 
and the ancient Philosophers. 
[/25./] 
It seems also the Prophets were not 
[/26./] 
ignorant of these things; for there 
[/27./] 
is mentioned of the stones of fire 
[/28./] 
attained by wisdome, the stone of 
Tinne in the hand of Zerubabel 
by the treasures, and stone of darkness, 
and as it were fire turned up, 
yet they knew not the order of 
[^p.18^] 
making the Physical and Metaphysical 
bodies. For in nature many 
things are produced by habitual 
vertue, which seem incredible.
