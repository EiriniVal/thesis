[^Extract 1, pp. 1-66^] 
 
[^p.1^] 
[}New-Englands 
RARITIES 
Discovered.}] 
 
IN the year of our Lord 1663. May 
28. upon an Invitation from my only 
Brother, I departed from London, and 
arrived at Boston, the chief Town in 
the Massachusets, a Colony of English-men 
in New-England, the 28th of July 
following. 
 
Boston (whose longitude is 315 deg. and 
42 deg. 30 min. of North Latitude) is 
built on the South-west side of a Bay 
large enough for the Anchorage of 500 
Sail of Ships, the Buildings are handsome, 
joyning one to the other as in London, with 
many large streets, most of them paved 
with pebble stone, in the high street towards 
the Common there are fair Buildings 
some of stone, and at the East End of the 
[^p.2^] 
Town one amongst the rest, built by the 
Shore by Mr. Gibs a Merchant, being a 
stately Edifice, which it is thought will 
stand him in little less than 3000 l. before 
it be fully finished. The Town is not divided 
into Parishes, yet they have three 
fair Meeting-houses or Churches, which 
hardly suffice to receive the Inhabitants 
and Strangers that come in from all parts. 
 
Having refreshed my self here for some 
time, and opportunely lighting upon a 
passage in a Bark belonging to a Friend 
of my Brothers, and bound to the East-ward, 
I put to sea again, and on the Fifteenth 
of August I arrived at Black-point, 
otherwise called Scarborow, the habitation 
of my beloved Brother, being about an 
hundred leagues to the Eastward of Boston; 
here I resided eight years, and made it my 
business to discover all along the Natural, 
Physical, and Chyrurgical Rarities of this 
New-found World. 
 
New-England is said to begin at 40 and 
to end at 46 of Northerly Latitude, that 
is from de la Ware Bay to New-found-Land. 
 
The Sea Coasts are accounted wholsomest, 
the East and South Winds coming 
[^p.3^] 
from Sea produceth warm weather, the 
Northwest coming over land causeth extremity 
of Cold, and many times strikes 
the Inhabitants both English and Indian 
with that sad Disease called there the 
Plague of the Back, but with us Empiema. 
 
The Country generally is Rocky and 
Mountanous, and extremely overgrown 
with wood, yet here and there beautified 
with large rich Valleys, wherein are Lakes 
ten, twenty, yea sixty miles in compass, 
out of which our great Rivers have their 
Beginnings. 
 
Fourscore miles (upon a direct line) to 
the Northwest of Scarborow, a Ridge of 
Mountains run Northwest and Northeast 
an hundred Leagues, known by the name 
of the White Mountains, upon which lieth 
Snow all the year, and is a Land-mark 
twenty miles off at Sea. It is rising ground 
from the Sea shore to these Hills, and they 
are inaccessible but by the Gullies which 
the dissolved Snow hath made; in these 
Gullies grow Saven Bushes, which being 
taken hold of are a good help to the 
climbing Discoverer; upon the top of the 
highest of these Mountains is a large Level 
[^p.4^] 
or Plain of a days journey over, where-on 
nothing grows but Moss; at the farther 
end of this Plain is another Hill called 
the Sugar-loaf, to outward appearance a 
rude heap of massie stones piled one upon 
another, and you may as you ascend step 
from one stone to another, as if you were 
going up a pair of stairs, but winding still 
about the Hill till you come to the top, 
which will require half a days time, and 
yet it is not above a Mile, where there is 
also a Level of about an Acre of ground, 
with a pond of clear water in the midst 
of it; which you may hear run down, 
but how it ascends is a mystery. From 
this rocky Hill you may see the whole 
Country round about; it is far above the 
lower Clouds, and from hence we beheld 
a Vapour (like a great Pillar) drawn up by 
the Sun Beams out of a great Lake or Pond 
into the Air, where it was formed into 
a Cloud. The Country beyond these 
Hills Northward is daunting terrible, being 
full of rocky Hills, as thick as Mole-hills 
in a Meadow, and cloathed with infinite 
thick Woods. 
 
New-England is by some affirmed to be 
an Island, bounded on the North with the 
[^p.5^] 
River Canada (so called from Monsieur 
Cane) on the South with the River Mohegan 
or Hudsons River, so called because 
he was the first that discovered it. Some 
will have America to be an Island, which 
out of question must needs be, if there 
be a Northeast passage found out into the 
South Sea; it contains 1152400000 Acres. 
The discovery of the Northwest passage 
(which lies within the River of Canada) 
was undertaken with the help of some 
Protestant Frenchmen, which left Canada 
and retired to Boston about the year 1669. 
The Northeast people of America, i. e. New-England, 
&c. are judged to be Tartars called 
Samoades, being alike in complexion, 
shape, habit and manners, (see the Globe:) 
Their Language is very significant, using 
but few words, every word having a diverse 
signification, which is exprest by their gesture; 
as when they hold their head of one 
side the word signifieth one thing, holding 
their hand up when they pronounce it signifieth 
another thing. Their Speeches in their 
Assemblies are very gravely delivered, commonly 
in perfect Hexamiter Verse, with 
great silence and attention, and answered 
again ex tempore after the same manner. 
 
[^p.6^] 
Having given you some short Notes 
concerning the Country in general, I shall 
now enter upon the proposed Discovery of 
the Natural, Physical, and Chyrurgical 
Rarities; and that I may methodically deliver 
them unto you, I shall cast them into 
this form: 1. Birds. 2. Beasts. 3. Fishes. 
4. Serpents and Insects. 5. Plants, of these 
1. such Plants as are common with us, 2. of 
such Plants as are proper to the Country, 
3. of such Plants as are proper to the 
Country and have no name known to us, 
4. of such Plants as have sprung up since 
the English Planted and kept Cattle there, 
5. of such Garden Herbs (amongst us) 
as do thrive there and of such as do not. 
6. Of Stones, Minerals, Metals, and 
Earths. 
 
[}First, Of Birds.}] 
 
[}The Humming Bird.}] 
 
THe Humming Bird, the least of all 
Birds, little bigger than a Dor, of variable 
glittering Colours, they feed upon 
Honey, which they suck out of Blossoms 
[^p.7^] 
and Flowers with their long Needle-like 
Bills; they sleep all Winter, and are not to 
be seen till the Spring, at which time they 
breed in little Nests made up like a bottom 
of soft Silk-like matter, their Eggs no 
bigger than a white Pease, they hatch three 
or four at a time, and are proper to this 
Country. 
 
[}The Troculus.}] 
 
The Troculus, a small Bird, black and 
white, no bigger than a Swallow, the 
points of whose Feathers are sharp, which 
they stick into the sides of the Chymney 
(to rest themselves, their Legs being exceeding 
short) where they breed in Nests 
made like a Swallows Nest, but of a 
glewy substance, and which is not fastened 
to the Chymney as a Swallows Nest, but 
hangs down the Chymney by a clew-like 
string a yard long. They commonly have 
four or five young ones, and when they 
go away, which is much about the time 
that Swallows use to depart, they never 
fail to throw down one of their young 
Birds into the room by way of Gratitude. 
I have more than once observed, that against 
the ruin of the Family these Birds will suddenly 
forsake the house and come no more. 
 
[^p.8^] 
[}The Pilhannaw.}] 
 
The Pilhannaw or Mechquan, much like 
the description of the Indian Ruck, a monstrous 
great Bird, a kind of Hawk, some 
say an Eagle, four times as big as a Gos-hawk, 
white Mail'd, having two or three 
purple Feathers in her head as long as 
Geeses Feathers they make Pens of, 
the Quills of these Feathers are purple, as 
big as Swans Quills and transparent; her 
Head is as big as a Childs of a year old, a 
very Princely Bird; when she soars abroad, 
all sort of feathered Creatures hide themselves, 
yet she never preys upon any of 
them, but upon Fawns and Jaccals: She 
Ayries in the Woods upon the high Hills 
of Ossapy, and is very rarely or seldome 
seen. 
 
[}The Turkie.}] 
 
The Turkie, who is blacker than ours; 
I have heard several credible persons affirm, 
they have seen Turkie Cocks that have 
weighed forty, yea sixty pound; but out 
of my personal experimental knowledge 
I can assure you, that I have eaten my 
share of a Turkie Cock, that when he 
was pull'd and garbidg'd, weighed thirty 
[^p.9^] 
pound; and I have also seen threescore 
broods of young Turkies on the side of a 
Marsh, sunning of themselves in a morning 
betimes, but this was thirty years 
since, the English and the Indian having now 
destroyed the breed, so that 'tis very rare 
to meet with a wild Turkie in the Woods; 
but some of the English bring up great 
store of the wild kind, which remain about 
their Houses as tame as ours in England. 
 
[}The Goose.}] 
 
The Goose, of which there are three 
kinds; the Gray Goose, the White Goose, 
and the Brant: The Goose will live a long 
time; I once found in a White Goose three 
Hearts, she was a very old one, and so 
tuff, that we gladly gave her over although 
exceeding well roasted. 
 
[}The Bloody-Flux Cured.}] 
 
A Friend of mine of good Quality living 
sometime in Virginia was sore troubled 
for a long time with the Bloody-Flux, 
having tryed several Remedies by the 
advice of his Friends without any good 
effect, at last was induced with a longing 
desire to drink the Fat Dripping 
[^p.10^] 
of a Goose newly taken from the Fire, 
which absolutely cured him, who was in 
despair of ever recovering his health 
again. 
 
[}The Gripe and Vulture.}] 
 
The Gripe, which is of two kinds, the 
one with a white Head, the other with a 
black Head, this we take for the Vulture: 
They are both cowardly Kites, preying 
upon Fish cast up on the shore. In the 
year 1668. there was a great mortallity 
of Eels in Casco Bay, thither resorted 
at the same time an infinite number of 
Gripes, insomuch that being shot by the 
Inhabitants, they fed their Hogs with them 
for some weeks; at other times you shall 
seldome see above two or three in a dozen 
miles travelling. The Quill Feathers in 
their Wings make excellent Text Pens, 
and the Feathers of their Tail are highly 
esteemed by the Indians for their Arrows, 
they will not sing in flying; a Gripes Tail 
is worth a Beavers Skin up in the Country. 
 
[}A Remedy for the Coldness and pain of the 
Stomach.}] 
 
The Skin of a Gripe drest with the doun 
on, is good to wear upon the Stomach for 
the Pain and Coldness of it. 
 
[^p.11^] 
[}The Osprey.}] 
 
The Osprey, which in this Country is 
white mail'd. 
 
[}A Remedy for the Tooth-ach.}] 
 
Their Beaks excell for the Tooth-ach, 
picking the Gums therewith till they 
bleed. 
 
[}The Wobble.}] 
 
The Wobble, an ill shaped Fowl, having 
no long Feathers in their Pinions, which is 
the reason they cannot fly, not much unlike 
the Pengwin; they are in the Spring very 
fat, or rather oyly, but pull'd and garbidg'd, 
and laid to the Fire to roast, they 
yield not one drop. 
 
[}For Aches.}] 
 
Our way (for they are very soveraign 
for Aches) is to make Mummy of them, 
that is, to salt them well, and dry them 
in an earthen pot well glazed in an Oven; 
or else (which is the better way) to bury 
them under ground for a day or two, then 
quarter them and stew them in a Tin Stew-pan 
with a very little water. 
 
[^p.12^] 
[}The Looue.}] 
 
The Looue is a Water Fowl, alike in 
shape to the Wobble, and as virtual for 
Aches, which we order after the same 
manner. 
 
[}The Owl.}] 
 
The Owl, Avis devia, which are of 
three kinds; the great Gray Owl with 
Ears, the little Gray Owl, and the White 
Owl which is no bigger than a Thrush. 
 
[}The Turkie Buzzard.}] 
 
The Turkie Buzzard, a kind of Kite, 
but as big as a Turkie, brown of colour, 
and very good meat. 
 
[}What Birds are not to be found in New-England.}] 
 
Now by what the Country hath not, 
you may ghess at what it hath; it hath no 
Nightingals, nor Larks, nor Bulfinches, 
nor Sparrows, nor Blackbirds, nor Magpies, 
[^p.13^] 
nor Jackdawes, nor Popinjays, nor 
Rooks, nor Pheasants, nor Woodcocks, nor 
Quails, nor Robins, nor Cuckoes, &c. 
 
[}Secondly, Of Beasts.}] 
 
[}The Bear, which are generally black.}] 
 
THe Bear, they live four months in 
Caves, that is all Winter; in the Spring 
they bring forth their young ones, they 
seldome have above three Cubbs in a litter, 
are very fat in the Fall of the Leaf with 
feeding upon Acorns, at which time they 
are excellent Venison; their Brains are 
venomous; they feed much upon water 
Plantane in the Spring and Summer, and 
Berries, and also upon a shell-fish called a 
Horse-foot, and are never mankind, i. e. 
fierce, but in rutting time, and then they 
walk the Country twenty, thirty, forty in 
a company, making a hideous noise with 
roaring, which you may hear a mile or 
two before they come so near to endanger 
the Traveller. About four years since, 
Acorns being very scarce up in the Country, 
some numbers of them came down 
[^p.14^] 
amongst the English Plantations, which 
generally are by the Sea side; at one 
Town called Gorgiana in the Province of 
Meyn (called also New-Sommerset-shire) 
they kill'd fourscore. 
 
[}For Aches and Cold Swellings.}] 
 
Their Grease is very good for Aches 
and Cold Swellings, the Indians anoint 
themselves therewith from top to toe, 
which hardens them against the cold 
weather. A black Bears Skin heretofore 
was worth forty shillings, now you may 
have one for ten, much used by the English 
for Beds and Coverlets, and by the Indians 
for Coats. 
 
[}For pain and lameness upon Cold.}] 
 
One Edw. Andrews being foxt, and falling 
backward cross a Thought in a Shallop 
or Fisher-boat, and taking cold upon 
it, grew crooked, lame, and full of pain, 
was cured, lying one Winter upon Bears 
Skins newly flead off, with some upon 
him, so that he sweat every night. 
 
[}The Wolf.}] 
 
The Wolf, of which there are two 
kinds; one with a round ball'd Foot, and 
[^p.15^] 
are in shape like mungrel Mastiffs; the other 
with a flat Foot, these are liker Greyhounds, 
and are called Deer Wolfs, because they 
are accustomed to prey upon Deer. A Wolf 
will eat a Wolf new dead, and so do Bears 
as I suppose, for their dead Carkases are 
never found, neither by the Indian nor 
English. They go a clicketing twelve days, 
and have as many Whelps at a Litter as a 
Bitch. The Indian Dog is a Creature begotten 
'twixt a Wolf and a Fox, which 
the Indians lighting upon, bring up to hunt 
the Deer with. The Wolf is very numerous, 
and go in companies, sometimes ten, 
twenty, more or fewer, and so cunning, 
that seldome any are kill'd with Guns or 
Traps; but of late they have invented 
a way to destroy them, by binding four 
Maycril Hooks a cross with a brown 
thread, and then wrapping some Wool 
about them, they dip them in melted Tallow 
till it be as round and as big as an Egg; 
these (when any Beast hath been kill'd by 
the Wolves) they scatter by the dead Carkase, 
after they have beaten off the 
Wolves; about Midnight the Wolves are 
sure to return again to the place where 
they left the slaughtered Beast, and the 
[^p.16^] 
first thing they venture upon will be these 
balls of fat. 
 
[}For old Aches.}] 
 
A black Wolfs Skin is worth a Beaver 
Skin among the Indians, being highly 
esteemed for helping old Aches in old 
people, worn as a Coat; they are not 
mankind, as in Ireland and other Countries, 
but do much harm by destroying of our 
English Cattle. 
 
[}The Ounce.}] 
 
The Ounce or Wild Cat, is about the 
bigness of two lusty Ram Cats, preys 
upon Deer and our English Poultrey: I 
once found six whole Ducks in the belly 
of one I killed by a Pond side: Their 
Flesh roasted is as good as Lamb, and as 
white. 
 
[}For Aches and shrunk Sinews.}] 
 
Their Grease is soveraign for all manner 
of Aches and shrunk Sinews: Their Skins 
are accounted good Fur, but somewhat 
course. 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}The Raccoon.}] 
 
The Raccoon liveth in hollow trees, and 
is about the size of a Gib Cat; they feed 
upon Moss, and do infest our Indian 
Corn very much; they will be exceeding 
fat in Autumn; their flesh is somewhat 
dark, but good food roasted. 
 
[}For Bruises and Aches.}] 
 
Their Fat is excellent for Bruises and 
Aches. Their Skins are esteemed a good 
deep Fur, but yet as the Wild Cats some-what 
coarse. 
 
[}The Porcupine.}] 
 
The Porcupine in some parts of the 
Countrey Eastward, towards the French, 
are as big as an ordinary Mungrel Cur; 
a very angry Creature and dangerous, 
shooting a whole shower of Quills with 
a rowse at their enemies, which are of 
that nature, that wherever they stick in the 
flesh, they will work through in a short 
time if not prevented by pulling of them 
out. The Indians make use of their Quills, 
which are hardly a handful long, to adorn 
[^p.18^] 
the edges of their birchen dishes, and 
weave (dying some of them red, others 
yellow and blew) curious bags or pouches, 
in works like Turkie-work. 
 
[}The Beaver, Canis Ponticus, Amphybious.}] 
 
The Beaver, whose old ones are as big 
as an Otter, or rather bigger, a Creature 
of a rare instinct, as may apparently be 
seen in their artificial Dam-heads to raise 
the water in the Ponds where they keep, 
and their houses having three stories, which 
would be too large to discourse: They 
have all of them four Cods hanging outwardly 
between their hinder legs, two of 
them are soft or oyly, and two solid or 
hard; the Indians say they are Hermaphrodites. 
 
[}For Wind in the Stomach.}] 
 
Their solid Cods are much used in Physick: 
Our Englishwomen in this Country 
use the powder grated, as much as will lye 
upon a shilling in a draught of Fiol Wine, 
for Wind in the Stomach and Belly, and 
venture many times in such cases to give 
it to Women with Child: Their Tails are 
flat, and covered with Scales without hair, 
[^p.19^] 
which being flead off, and the Tail boiled, 
proves exceeding good meat, being all 
Fat, and as sweet as Marrow. 
 
[}The Moose Deer.}] 
 
The Moose Deer, which is a very goodly 
Creature, some of them twelve foot high, 
with exceeding fair Horns with broad 
Palms, some of them two fathom from 
the tip of one Horn to the other; they 
commonly have three Fawns at a time; 
their flesh is not dry like Deers flesh, but 
moist and lushious somewhat like Horse 
flesh (as they judge that have tasted of 
both) but very wholsome. The flesh of 
their Fawns is an incomparable dish, beyond 
the flesh of an Asses Foal so highly 
esteemed by the Romans, or that of young 
Spaniel Puppies so much cried up in our 
days in France and England. 
 
[}Moose Horns better for Physick use than 
Harts Horns.}] 
 
Their Horns are far better (in my opinion) 
for Physick than the Horns of other 
Deer, as being of a stronger nature: As 
for their Claws, which both Englishmen 
and French make use of for Elk, I cannot 
[^p.20^] 
approve so to be from the Effects, having 
had some trial of it; besides, all that 
write of the Elk, describe him with a tuft 
of hair on the left Leg behind, a little above 
the pastern joynt on the outside of the 
Leg, not unlike the tuft (as I conceive) 
that groweth upon the Breast of a Turkie 
Cock, which I could never yet see upon 
the Leg of a Moose, and I have seen some 
number of them. 
 
[}For Children breeding Teeth.}] 
 
The Indian Webbes make use of the 
broad Teeth of the Fawns to hang about 
their Childrens Neck when they are breeding 
of their Teeth. The Tongue of a 
grown Moose, dried in the smoak after 
the Indian manner, is a dish for a Sagamor. 
 
[}The Maccarib.}] 
 
The Maccarib, Caribo, or Pohano, a 
kind of Deer, as big as a Stag, round 
hooved, smooth hair'd and soft as silk; 
their Horns grow backwards a long their 
backs to their rumps, and turn again a 
handful beyond their Nose, having another 
Horn in the middle of their Forehead, 
about half a yard long, very straight, but 
[^p.21^] 
wreathed like an Unicorns Horn, of a 
brown jettie colour, and very smooth: 
The Creature is no where to be found, but 
upon Cape Sable in the French Quarters, 
and there too very rarely, they being not 
numerous; some few of their Skins and 
their streight Horns are (but very sparingly) 
brought to the English. 
 
[}The Fox.}] 
 
The Fox, which differeth not much 
from ours, but are somewhat less; a black 
Fox Skin heretofore was wont to be valued 
at fifty and sixty pound, but now you 
may have them for twenty shillings; indeed 
there is not any in New-England 
that are perfectly black, but silver hair'd, 
that is sprinkled with grey hairs. 
 
[}The Jaccal.}] 
 
The Jaccal, is a Creature that hunts 
the Lions prey, a shrew'd sign that there 
are Lions upon the Continent; there are 
those that are yet living in the Countrey, 
that do constantly affirm, that about six 
or seven and thirty years since an Indian 
[^p.22^] 
shot a young Lion, sleeping upon the body 
of an Oak blown up by the roots, with 
an Arrow, not far from Cape Anne, and sold 
the Skin to the English. But to say some-thing 
of the Jaccal, they are ordinarily 
less than Foxes, of the colour of a gray 
Rabbet, and do not scent nothing near so 
strong as a Fox; some of the Indians will 
eat of them: Their Grease is good for all 
that Fox Grease is good for, but weaker; 
they are very numerous. 
 
[}The Hare.}] 
 
The Hare in New-England is no bigger 
than our English Rabbets, of the same 
colour, but withall having yellow and 
black strokes down the ribs; in Winter 
they are milk white, and as the Spring 
approacheth they come to their colour; 
when the Snow lies upon the ground they 
are very bitter with feeding upon the bark 
of Spruce, and the like. 
 
[^p.23^] 
[}Thirdly, Of Fishes.}] 
 
PLiny and Isadore write there are not 
above 144 Kinds of Fishes, but to 
my knowledge there are nearer 300: I 
suppose America was not known to Pliny 
and Isadore.

Physick: This Fish is here in great plenty, 
and in some Rivers so numerous, that it is 
hazardous for Canoes and the like small 
Vessels to pass to and again, as in Pechipscut 
River to the Eastward. 
 
[}The Cod.}] 
 
The Cod, which is a staple Commodity 
in the Country. 
 
[}To stop Fluxes of Blood.}] 
 
In the Head of this Fish is found a Stone, 
or rather a Bone, which being pulveriz'd 
and drank in any convenient liquor, will 
stop Womens overflowing Courses notably: 
Likewise, 
 
[^p.33^] 
[}For the Stone.}] 
 
There is a Stone found in their Bellies, 
in a Bladder against their Navel, which 
being pulveriz'd and drank in White-wine 
Posset or Ale, is present Remedy for the 
Stone. 
 
[}To heal a green Cut.}] 
 
About their Fins you may find a kind 
of Lowse, which healeth a green Cut in 
short time. 
 
[}To restore them that have melted their 
Grease.}] 
 
Their Livers and Sounds eaten, is a good 
Medicine for to restore them that have 
melted their Grease. 
 
[}The Dogfish.}] 
 
The Dogfish, a ravenous Fish. 
 
[}For the Toothach.}] 
 
Upon whose Back grows a Thorn two 
or three Inches long, that helps the Tooth-ach, 
scarifying the Gums therewith. 
 
Their Skins are good to cover Boxes and 
Instrument Cases. 
 
[^p.34^] 
[}The Stingray.}] 
 
The Stingray, a large Fish, of a rough 
Skin, good to cover Boxes and Hafts of 
Knives, and Rapier sticks. 
 
[}The Tortous.}] 
 
The Turtle or Tortous, of which there 
are three kinds: 1. The Land Turtle; they 
are found in dry sandy Banks, under old 
Houses, and never go into the water. 
 
[}For the Ptisick, Consumption, and Morbus 
Gallicus.}] 
 
They are good for the Ptisick and Consumptions, 
and some say the Morbus Gallicus.

and stink. 
 
3. The Turtle that lives in Lakes and 
is called in Virginia a Terrapine. 
 
[}The Soile.}] 
 
The Soile or Sea Calf, a Creature that 
brings forth her young ones upon dry 
land, but at other times keeps in the Sea 
preying upon Fish. 
 
[^p.35^] 
[}For Scalds and Burns, and for the Mother.}] 
 
The Oyl of it is much used by the 
Indians, who eat of it with their Fish, 
and anoint their limbs therewith, and 
their Wounds and Sores: It is very good 
for Scalds and Burns; and the fume of it, 
being cast upon Coals, will bring Women 
out of the Mother Fits. The Hair upon 
the young ones is white, and as soft as 
silk; their Skins, with the Hair on, are 
good to make Gloves for the Winter. 
 
[}The Sperma Ceti Whale.}] 
 
The Sperma Ceti Whale differeth from 
the Whales that yield us Whale-bones, 
for the first hath great and long Teeth, 
the other is nothing but Bones with Tassels 
hanging from their Jaws, with which they 
suck in their prey. 
 
[}What Sperma Ceti is.}] 
 
It is not long since a Sperma Ceti Whale 
or two were cast upon the shore, not far 
from Boston in the Massachusets Bay, which 
being cut into small pieces and boiled in 
Cauldrons, yielded plenty of Oyl; the 
Oyl put up into Hogsheads, and stow'd 
into Cellars for some time, Candies at the 
[^p.36^] 
bottom, it may be one quarter; then the 
Oyl is drawn off, and the Candied Stuff 
put up into convenient Vessels is sold for 
Sperma Ceti, and is right Sperma Ceti. 
 
[}For Bruises and Aches.}] 
 
The Oyl that was drawn off Candies 
again and again, if well ordered; and is 
admirable for Bruises and Aches. 
 
[}What Ambergreece is.}] 
 
Now you must understand this Whale 
feeds upon Ambergreece, as is apparent, 
finding it in the Whales Maw in great 
quantity, but altered and excrementitious: 
I conceive that Ambergreece is no other than 
a kind of Mushroom growing at the bottom 
of some Seas; I was once shewed (by a 
Mariner) a piece of Ambergreece having 
a root to it like that of the land Mushroom, 
which the Whale breaking up, some 
scape his devouring Paunch, and is afterwards 
cast upon shore. 
 
[}The Coccle.}] 
 
A kind of Coccle, of whose Shell the 
Indians make their Beads called Wompampeag 
and Mohaicks, the first are white, 
the other blew, both Orient, and beautified 
[^p.37^] 
with a purple Vein. The white 
Beads are very good to stanch Blood. 
 
[}The Scarlet Muscle.}] 
 
The Scarlet Muscle, at Paschatawey a 
Plantation about fifty leagues by Sea Eastward 
from Boston, in a small Cove called 
Bakers Cove there is found this kind of 
Muscle which hath a purple Vein, which 
being prickt with a Needle yieldeth a perfect 
purple or scarlet juice, dying Linnen 
so that no washing will wear it out, but 
keeps its lustre many years: We mark 
our Handkerchiefs and Shirts with it. 
 
[}Fish of greatest Esteem in the West-Indies.}] 
 
The Indians of Peru esteem of three 
Fishes more than any other, viz. the Sea 
Torteise, the Tubaron, and the Manate 
or Sea Cow; but in New-England the Indians 
have in greatest request, the Bass, 
the Sturgeon, the Salmon, the Lamprey, the 
Eel, the Frost-fish, the Lobster and the 
Clam. 
 
[^p.38^] 
[}Fourthly, Of Serpents, and 
Insects.}] 
 
[}The Pond Frog.}] 
 
THe Pond Frog, which chirp in the 
Spring like Sparows, and croke like 
Toads in Autumn: Some of these when 
they set upon their breech are a Foot high 
the Indians will tell you, that up in the 
Country there are Pond Frogs as big as a 
Child of a year old. 
 
[}For Burns, Scalds, and Inflammations.}] 
 
They are of a glistering brass colour, 
and very fat, which is excellent for Burns 
and Scaldings, to take out the Fire, and heal 
them, leaving no Scar; and is also very 
good to take away any Inflammation. 
 
[}The Rattle Snake.}] 
 
The Rattle Snake, who poysons with 
a Vapour that comes thorough two crooked 
Fangs in their Mouth; the hollow of 
these Fangs are as black as Ink: The Indians, 
when weary with travelling, will 
[^p.39^] 
take them up with their bare hands, laying 
hold with one hand behind their Head, with 
the other taking hold of their Tail, and 
with their teeth tear off the Skin of their 
Backs, and feed upon them alive; which 
they say refresheth them. 
 
[}For frozen Limbs, Aches, and Bruises.}] 
 
They have Leafs of Fat in their Bellies, 
which is excellent to annoint frozen Limbs, 
and for Aches and Bruises wondrous soveraign. 
Their Hearts swallowed fresh is a 
good Antidote against their Venome, and 
their Liver (the Gall taken out) bruised 
and applied to their Bitings is a present 
Remedy. 
 
[}Of Insects.}] 
 
[}A Bug.}] 
 
THere is a certain kind of Bug like a 
Beetle, but of a glistering brass colour, 
with four strong Tinsel Wings; 
their Bodies are full of Corruption or white 
Matter like a Maggot; being dead, and 
kept a while, they will stench odiously; 
they beat the Humming Birds from the 
Flowers. 
 
[^p.40^] 
[}The Wasp.}] 
 
The Wasps in this Countrey are pied, 
black and white, breed in Hives made like 
a great Pine Apple, their entrance is at 
the lower end, the whole Hive is of an 
Ash Colour, but of what matter its made 
no man knows; Wax it is not, neither 
will it melt nor fry, but will take fire 
suddenly like Tinder: This they fasten to 
a Bow, or build it round about a low Bush, 
a Foot from the ground. 
 
[}The flying Gloworm.}]

Summer Nights like sparks of Fire in 
great number; they are common liewise

you may in a small compass gather whole 
Cart-loads of it. 
 
[}Wounds and Aches Cured by the Indians. 
For the Tooth-ach. For Herpes milliares.}] 
 
The Indians Cure their Wounds with 
it, annointing the Wound first with Raccoons 
greese, or Wild-Cats greese, and 
strewing upon it the powder of the Roots; 
and for Aches they scarifie the grieved part, 
and annoint it with one of the foresaid 
Oyls, then strew upon it the powder:

Legs, fomenting with the decoction, and 
applying the Feces in the form of a Cataplasme.

but Oak of Hierusalem is stronger 
in operation; excellent for stuffing of 
the Lungs upon Colds, shortness of Wind, 
and the Ptisick; maladies that the Natives 
are often troubled with: I helped several 
of the Indians with a Drink made of two 
Gallons of Molosses wort, (for in that part 
of the Country where I abode, we made 
our Beer of Molosses, Water, Bran, chips 
of Sassafras Root, and a little Wormwood, 
well boiled,) into which I put of 
Oak of Hierusalem, Cat mint, Sowthistle, 
of each one handful, of Enula Campana

There is Oak of three kinds, white, red 
and black, the white is excellent to make 
Canoes of, Shallopes, Ships, and other 
Vessels for the Sea, and for Claw-board, 
and Pipe-staves, the black is good to make 
Waynscot of; and out of the white Oak 
Acorns, (which is the Acorn Bears delight 
to feed upon): The Natives draw an 
Oyl, taking the rottenest Maple Wood, 
which being burnt to ashes, they make a 
strong Lye therewith, wherein they boyl 
their white Oak-Acorns until the Oyl 
swim on the top in great quantity; this 
[^p.49^] 
they fleet off, and put into bladders to annoint 
their naked Limbs, which corrobarates 
them exceedingly; they eat it likewise 
with their Meat, it is an excellent clear and 
sweet Oyl: Of the Moss that grows at 
the roots of the white Oak the Indesses 
make a strong decoction, with which they 
help their Papouses or young Childrens 
scall'd Heads.

black Birch, the Indians use it for Touch-wood; 
and therewith they help the Sciatica, 
or Gout of the Hip, or any great 
Ach, burning the Patient with it in two 
or three places upon the Thigh, and upon 
certain Veins. 
 
[}2. Of such Plants as are proper to 
the Country.}] 
 
[}To ripen any Impostume or Swelling. For 
sore Mouths. The New-Englands 
standing Dish.}] 
 
INdian Wheat, of which there is three 
sorts, yellow, red, and blew; the blew 
is commonly Ripe before the other a 
Month: Five or Six Grains of Indian 
Wheat hath produced in one year 600. 
It is hotter than our Wheat and clammy; 
excellent in Cataplasms to ripen any Swelling 
or impostume. The decoction of the 
blew Corn, is good to wash sore Mouths 
with: It is light of digestion, and the 
English make a kind of Loblolly of it, 
[^p.53^] 
to eat with Milk, which they call Sampe; 
they beat it in a Morter, and sift the flower 
out of it; the remainer they call Homminey, 
which they put into a Pot of two or 
three Gallons, with Water, and boyl it 
upon a gentle Fire till it be like a Hasty 
Pudden; they put of this into Milk, and 
so eat it. Their Bread also they make of 
the Homminey so boiled, and mix their 
Flower with it, cast it into a deep Bason 
in which they form the Loaf, and then 
turn it out upon the Peel, and presently put 
it into the Oven before it spreads abroad; 
the Flower makes excellent Puddens. 
 
Bastard Calamus Aromaticus, agrees 
with the description, but is not barren; they 
flower in July, and grow in wet places, as 
about the brinks of Ponds. 
 
[}To keep the Feet warm.}] 
 
The English make use of the Leaves to 
to keep their Feet warm. There is a little 
Beast called a Muskquash, that liveth 
in small Houses in the Ponds, like Mole 
Hills, that feed upon these Plants; their 
Cods sent as sweet and as strong as Musk, 
and will last along time handsomly wrap'd 
up in Cotton wool; they are very good to 
lay amongst Cloaths. May is the best 
[^p.54^] 
time to kill them, for then their Cods sent 
strongest 
 
Wild-Leekes, which the Indians use 
much to eat with their fish. 
 
A Plant like Knavers-Mustard, called 
New-England Mustard. 
 
Mountain-Lillies, bearing many yellow 
Flowers, turning up their Leaves like the 
Martigon, or Turks Cap, spotted with 
small spots as deep as Safforn; they 
Flower in July. 
 
One Berry, or Herb True Love. See 
the Figure. 
 
Tobacco, there is not much of it Planted 
in New-England; the Indians make use 
of a small kind with short round leaves 
called Pooke. 
 
[}For Burns and Scalds.}] 
 
With a strong decoction of Tobacco 
they Cure Burns and Scalds, boiling it in 
Water from a Quart to a Pint, then wash 
the Sore therewith, and strew on the powder 
of dryed Tobacco. 
 
Hollow Leaved Lavender, is a Plant that 
grows in salt Marshes overgrown with 
Moss, with one straight stalk about the 
bigness of an Oat straw, better than a 
Cubit high; upon the top-standeth one 
[^p.55^] 
fantastical Flower, the Leaves grow close 
from the root, in shape like a Tankard, 
hollow, tough, and alwayes full of Water, 
the Root is made up of many small strings, 
growing only in the Moss, and not in 
the Earth, the whole Plant comes to its 
perfection in August, and then it has 
Leaves, Stalks, and Flowers as red as 
blood, excepting the Flower which hath 
some yellow admixt. I wonder where 
the knowledge of this Plant hath slept all 
this while, i. e. above Forty Years. 
 
[}For all manner of Fluxes.}] 
 
It is excellent for all manner of Fluxes. 
 
Live for ever, a kind of Cad weed. 
 
Tree Primerose, taken by the Ignorant 
for Scabious. 
 
A Solar Plant, as some will have it. 
 
Maiden Hair, or Cappellus veneris verus, 
which ordinarily is half a Yard in 
height. The Apothecaries for shame now 
will substitute Wall-Rue no more for Maiden 
Hair, since it grows in abundance in 
New-England, from whence they may 
have good store. 
 
Pirola, Two kinds. See the Figures, 
both of them excellent Wound Herbs. 
 
Homer's Molley. 
 
[^p.56^] 
Lysimachus, or Loose Strife, it grows in 
dry grounds in the open Sun four foot 
high, Flowers from the middle of the Plant 
to the top, the Flowers purple, standing upon 
a small sheath or cod, which when it is ripe 
breaks and puts forth a white silken doun, 
the stalk is red, and as big as ones Finger. 
 
Marygold of Peru, of which there are 
two kinds, one bearing black seeds, the 
other black and white streak'd, this beareth 
the fairest flowers, commonly but one 
upon the very top of the stalk. 
 
Treacle-Berries. See before Salomons 
Seal. 
 
Oak of Hierusalem. See before. 
 
Oak of Cappadocea. See before. 
 
Earth-Nuts, differing much from those 
in England, one sort of them bears a most 
beautiful Flower. 
 
[}For the Scurvy and Dropsie.}] 
 
Sea-Tears, they grow upon the Sea 
banks in abundance, they are good for the 
Scurvy and Dropsie, boiled and eaten as 
a Sallade, and the broth drunk with it. 
 
[}Indian Beans, better for Physick use than 
other Beans.}] 
 
Indian Beans, falsly called French beans, 
are better for Physick and Chyrurgery 
[^p.57^] 
than our Garden Beans. Probatum est: 
 
Squashes, but more truly Squontersquashes, 
a kind of Mellon, or rather Gourd, 
for they oftentimes degenerate into 
Gourds; some of these are green, some 
yellow, some longish like a Gourd, others 
round like an Apple, all of them pleasant 
food boyled and buttered, and season'd 
with Spice; but the yellow Squash called 
an Apple Squash, because like an Apple, 
and about the bigness of a Pome-water, 
is the best kind; they are much eaten by 
the Indians and the English, yet they 
breed the small white Worms (which 
Physitians call Ascarides,) in the long Gut 
that vex the Fundament with a perpetual 
itching, and a desire to go to stool. 
 
Water-Mellon, it is a large Fruit, 
but nothing near so big as a Pompion, 
colour, smoother, and of a sad Grass green 
rounder, or more rightly Sap-green; 
with some yellowness admixt when ripe; 
the seeds are black, the flesh or pulpe exceeding 
juicy. 
 
[}For heat and thirst in Feavers.}] 
 
It is often given to those sick of Feavers, 
and other hot Diseases with good 
success. 
 
[^p.58^] 
New-England Daysie, or Primrose, is 
the second kind of Navel Wort in Johnson 
upon Gerard; it flowers in May, and 
grows amongst Moss upon hilly Grounds 
and Rocks that are shady. 
 
[}For Burns and Scalds.}] 
 
It is very good for Burns and Scalds. 
 
[}An Achariston, or Medicine deserving 
thanks.}] 
 
An Indian whose Thumb was swell'd, 
and very much inflamed, and full of pain, 
increasing and creeping along to the wrist, 
with little black spots under the Thumb 
against the Nail; I Cured it with this 
Umbellicus veneris Root and all, the Yolk 
of an Egg, and Wheat flower, f. Cataplasme. 
 
Briony of Peru, (we call it though it 
grown hear) or rather Scamnony; some 
take it for Mechoacan: The green Juice 
is absolutely Poyson; yet the Root when 
dry may safely be given to strong Bodies. 
 
Red and Black Currence. See before. 
 
Wild Damask Roses, single, but very 
large and sweet, but stiptick. 
 
Sweet Fern, the Roots run one within 
another like a Net, being very long and 
spreading abroad under the upper crust of 
[^p.59^] 
the Earth, sweet in taste, but withal astringent, 
much hunted after by our Swine: 
The Scotch-men that are in New-England 
have told me that it grows in Scotland. 
 
[}For Fluxes.}] 
 
The People boyl the tender tops in 
Molosses Beer, and in Possets for Fluxes, 
for which it is excellent. 
 
Sarsaparilia, a Plant not yet sufficiently 
known by the English: Some say it is a 
kind of Bind Weed; we have in New-England 
two Plants, that go under the 
name of Sarsaparilia; the one not above 
a foot in height without Thorns, the other 
having the same Leaf, but is a shrub as 
high as a Goose Berry Bush, and full of 
sharp Thorns; this I esteem as the right, 
by the shape and savour of the Roots, but 
rather by the effects answerable to that we 
have from other parts of the World; It 
groweth upon dry Sandy banks by the 
Sea side, and upon the banks of Rivers, 
so far as the Salt water flowes; and within 
Land up in the Country, as some have 
reported. 
 
Bill Berries, two kinds, Black and Sky 
Coloured, which is more frequent. 
 
[^p.60^] 
[}To cool the heat of Feavers, and quench 
Thirst.}] 
 
They are very good to allay the burning 
heat of Feavers, and hot Agues, either 
in Syrup or Conserve. 
 
[}A most excellent Summer Dish.}] 
 
They usually eat of them put into a 
Bason, with Milk, and sweetned a little 
more with Sugar and Spice, or for cold 
Stomachs, in Sack. The Indians dry them 
in the Sun, and sell them to the English by 
the Bushell, who make use of them instead 
of Currence, putting of them into Puddens, 
both boyled and baked, and into Water 
Gruel. 
 
Knot Berry, or Clowde Berry, seldom 
ripe. 
 
Sumach, differing from all that I did 
ever see in the Herbalists; our English 
Cattle devour it most abominably, leaving 
neither Leaf nor Branch, yet it sprouts 
again next Spring. 
 
[}For Colds.}] 
 
The English use to boyl it in Beer, and 
drink it for Colds; and so do the Indians, 
from whom the English had the Medicine. 
 
Wild Cherry, they grow in clusters like 
[^p.61^] 
Grapes, of the same bigness, blackish, red 
when ripe, and of a harsh taste. 
 
[}For Fluxes.}] 
 
They are also good for Fluxes. 
 
Transplanted and manured, they grow 
exceeding fair. 
 
Board Pine, is a very large Tree two 
or three Fadom about. 
 
[}For Wounds.}] 
 
It yields a very soveraign Turpentine 
for the Curing of desperate Wounds. 
 
[}For Stabbs.}] 
 
The Indians make use of the Moss boiled 
in Spring Water, for Stabbs, pouring 
in the Liquor, and applying the boiled 
Moss well stamp'd or beaten betwixt two 
stones. 
 
[}For Burning and Scalding.}] 
 
And for Burning and Scalding, they 
first take out the fire with a strong decoction 
of Alder Bark, then they lay upon it 
a Playster of the Bark of Board Pine first 
boyled tender, and beat to a Playster betwixt 
two stones. 
 
[}To take Fire out of a Burn.}] 
 
One Christopher Luxe, a Fisher-man, 
having burnt his Knee Pan, was healed 
[^p.62^] 
again by an Indian Webb, or Wife, (for so 
they call those Women that have Husbands;) 
She first made a strong decoction 
of Alder bark, with which she took 
out the Fire by Imbrocation, or letting of 
it drop upon the Sore, which would smoak 
notably with it; then she Playstered it 
with the Bark of Board Pine, or Hemlock 
Tree, boyled soft and stampt betwixt two 
stones, till is was as thin as brown Paper, 
and of the same Colour, she annointed 
the Playster with Soyles Oyl, and the Sore 
likewise, then she laid it on warm, and 
sometimes she made use of the bark of the 
Larch Tree. 
 
[}To eat out proud Flesh in a Sore.}] 
 
And to eat out the proud Flesh, they 
take a kind of Earth Nut boyled and 
stamped, and last of all, they apply to 
the Sore the Roots of Water Lillies boiled 
and stamped betwixt two stones, to a 
Playster. 
 
[}For Stitches.}] 
 
The Firr Tree, or Pitch Tree, the Tar 
that is made of all sorts of Pitch Wood is 
an excellent thing to take away those desperate 
Stitches of the Sides, which perpetually 
afflicteth those poor People that are 
[^p.63^] 
stricken with the Plague of the Back. 
 
Note, You must make a large Toast, or 
Cake slit and dip it in the Tar, and bind 
it warm to the Side. 
 
[}The most common Diseases in New England.}] 
 
The Black Pox, the Spotted Feaver, 
the Griping of the Guts, the Dropsie, and 
the Sciatica, are the killing Deseases in 
New-England. 
 
The Larch Tree, which is the only 
Tree of all the Pines, that sheds his Leaves 
before Winter; The other remaining 
Green all the Year: This is the Tree from 
which we gather that useful purging excrense 
Agarick. 
 
[}For Wounds and Cuts.}] 
 
The Leaves and Gum are both very 
good to heal Wounds and Cuts. 
 
[}For Wounds with Bruises.}] 
 
I Cured once a desperate Bruise with a 
Cut upon the Knee Pan, with an Ungent 
made with the Leaves of the Larch Tree, 
and Hogs Grease, but the Gum is best. 
 
Spruce is a goodly Tree, of which they 
make Masts for Ships, and Sail Yards: It 
is generally conceived by those that have 
[^p.64^] 
skill in Building of Ships, that here is absolutely 
the best Trees in the World, many 
of them being three Fathom about, and of 
great length. 
 
[}An Achariston for the Scurvy.}] 
 
The tops of Green Spruce Boughs boiled 
in Bear, and drunk, is assuredly one of the 
best Remedies for the Scurvy, restoring the 
Infected party in a short time; they also 
make a Lotion of some of the decoction, 
adding Hony and Allum. 
 
Hemlock Tree, a kind of Spruce, the 
bark of this Tree serves to dye Tawny; 
the Fishers Tan their Sails and Nets with 
it. 
 
[}To break Sore or Swelling.}] 
 
The Indians break and heal their Swellings 
and Sores with it, boyling the inner 
Bark of young Hemlock very well, then 
knocking of it betwixt two stones to a 
Playster, and annointing or soaking it in 
Soyls Oyl, they apply it to the Sore: it 
will break a Sore Swelling speedily. 
 
One Berry, Herba Paris, or True Love. 
 
Sassafras, or Ague Tree. 
 
[^p.65^] 
[}For heat in Feavers.}] 
 
The Chips of the Root boyled in Beer 
is excellent to allay the hot rage of Feavers, 
being drunk. 
 
[}For Bruises and dry Blowes.}] 
 
The Leaves of the same Tree are very 
good made into an Oyntment, for Bruises 
and dry Blows. The Bark of the Root 
we use instead of Cinamon; and it is Sold 
at the Barbadoes for two Shillings the 
Pound. 
 
And why may not this be the Bark the 
Jesuits Powder was made of, that was so 
Famous not long since in England, for 
Agues? 
 
Cran Berry, or Bear Berry, because 
Bears use much to feed upon them, is a 
small trayling Plant that grows in Salt 
Marshes that are over-grown with Moss; 
the tender Branches (which are reddish) 
run out in great length, lying flat on the 
ground, where at distances, they take Root, 
over-spreading sometimes half a score 
Acres, sometimes in small patches of about 
a Rood or the like; the Leaves are like 
Box, but greener, thick and glistering; 
the Blossoms are very like the Flowers of 
[^p.66^] 
our English Night Shade, after which 
succeed the Berries, hanging by long small 
foot stalks, no bigger than a hair; at first 
they are of a pale yellow Colour, afterwards 
red, and as big as a Cherry; some 
perfectly round, others Oval, all of them 
hollow, of a sower astringent taste; they 
are ripe in August and September. 
 
[}For the Scurvy.}] 
 
They are excellent against the Scurvy. 
 
[}For the heat in Feavers.}] 
 
They are also good to allay the fervour 
of hot Diseases. 
 
The Indians and English use them much, 
boyling them with Sugar for Sauce to eat 
with their Meat; and it is a delicate Sauce, 
especially for roasted Mutton: Some 
make Tarts with them as with Goose 
Berries. 
 
Vine, much differing in the Fruit, all 
of them very fleshy, some reasonably 
pleasant; others have a taste of Gun 
Powder, and these grow in Swamps, and 
low wet Grounds.
