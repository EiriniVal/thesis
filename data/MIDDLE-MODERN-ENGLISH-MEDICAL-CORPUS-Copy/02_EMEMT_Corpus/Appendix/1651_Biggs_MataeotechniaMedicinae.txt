AS the defection of oure Natures is such, 
we cannot look upon Nature with a 
[/1./] 
full ey'd penetrative aspect, but by 
the paralytick glaunces and touches 
of our dull & imperfect Opticks except 
our eyes be anointed with the true eye-salve; such 
also is our shameles prostitution to that habituated 
Custome to the wild discursions onely of our tongue 
and pen, that we cannot fix to any reall discourses, 
but what the wanton and inconstant wombe of putation 
hath generated, and what the Labirynth of 
weake fancy hath coin'd, or what hath been forged 
and circulated in the Poniterium or Laboratory of 
[^p.2^] 
our running, rambling Invention, being wyer-drawn 
and obtruded upon us by the frighted remaines 
of that caduce, specious and seductive chameleon, 
Reason; So that it is now a difficulty, not 
barely to thinke, not to talke and prate; the greater 
difficulty to discourse solidly, except our tongues 
be touch'd with a coal from the Altar of God; and 
our Cognition of objects in the verity of their essences 
be indubitate, flowing from the serene and omni-lucent 
fountain, the Intellect: yet as to this my 
Undertaking, I must in sober verity, and in all humility; 
without offence to any, seriously professe. 
[/2./] 
That, that which is the onely discommodity of speaking 
in a clear matter, the abundance of argument that presses 
to be utter'd, and the suspence of Judgement what to 
choose, and how in the multitude of Reason to be not tedious, 
is the greatest difficulty which I expect here to meet 
with. 
 
[/3./] 
Mine Appeal is faire, and not a whit derogatory 
from the honour or Credit of the Schools or Colledge, 
except they will stand to vye with the high Tribunal 
of this Nation, chiefely when things of this Nature, 
bulke and size, are worthy of the high notice of that 
supream Court and power, and is their due by that 
grand Charter of Philautie and selfe-concernment; 
more especially, when some of them have undergone 
the lash of miserable experience; and Physitians 
themselves must volent nolent subscribe to their own 
unsuccesfulnesse. And lastly the slow progresse they 
have made for these many yeares together in the 
principles and practice of Physick, wherein as much 
refractorinesse also is observed, as of former ages; 
[^p.3^] 
and which is to be pittied, an Antipathy of their spirits 
for the most part to this present government: all 
which, with much more may be said, gives us small 
hopes of ever effecting our design with any good 
successe, without the help of them, to whom, as to 
all humane affaires, our addresses and redresses are 
to be had. 
 
Those that are come to that unnaturall Dyscrasie, 
[/4./] 
as to digest poyson, and keck at wholsome food, it is 
not for any sober head to feed with them any longer; 
which, hath led me out among others, to reforme 
and oppose the utmost that study and true labour 
can attain; which new overture I know will have 
[/5./] 
the common fate, to be sinisterly receiv'd, and 
disrelish'd by those, whose gust cannot digest any 
thing, that hath the face or tendance to a generall 
good; which will appear on all hands very undeservedly 
in this, in that it undertakes the Cure and 
remove of an inveterate disease, crept into the 
greatest part of the world, and the best part of humane 
society. 
 
[/6./] 
For alas! what shall I get by this undertaking? It is 
better for me to be silent, and leave the discovery of 
these things with others of the like nature, unto the 
revolution of time the Mid-wife rather then the 
mother of truth, who is justified of her children; 
when she shall take these infant issues out from the 
open field into her bosome, to keep them warm 
and raise up their spirit and life, when she hath 
washed them and salted them, declared them legitimate, 
and church'd the father of the young Minerva 
from the needlesse causes of his purgation. 
 
Neither mine ear nor thoughts have, I may safely 
[/7./] 
[^p.4^] 
obtest the highest, been courted with the tickling 
affectations of praise, or deterred by dispaise or to be 
accounted unworthy, evill, not knowing or rash, for 
the good of the Creation of God, and so be my 
Neighbour feel not the detriment by the common Physick: 
[/8./] 
In the explosion of which, I do not intend to 
unbinde or meddle with that farrago, that bulkie and 
unwieldy part of blind learning, as to dissect each artery, 
veine, and nerve of the whole Edifice of Physik: 
For every principle is not fatall to the throughly 
sifted, neither have I vow'd my life or pawn'd my 
studies to clense this Augæan stable by an Herculean 
interpreting and detecting others dreames and 
dotages, a worke too low, and too hard for me; but 
yet perhaps such, as shall do more then whisper to 
the next Ages. It is calculated for the Meridian of 
fifty two degrees, Northern latitude, but may indifferently 
serve for the greatest part of the Europæan 
World. 
 
[/9./] 
The intire series or method of Physick is like the 
Polyus head, wherein there are observed to be 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] yea, more with 
pitty, then rashnes we speak it, we finde it to be a meer 
imposture, & searce an Oedipus in the world able to 
understand this knotted Sphynx, to which mans credulity, 
through a conceived hope; hath easily subscribed; 
and so, that religio medica, hath begotten it authority; 
[/10./] 
because for the most part, we too easily beleeve, what 
we too greedily wish or desire for; but yet it may 
as readily be made appear, that our confidence in the 
Theorem's of physick in this day, stands more upon our 
concessions then its patrons confessions. 
 
It is not unworthy our thoughts to consider how 
[/11./] 
[^p.5^] 
hotly like a Lady, Physick is courted and cring'd to, at 
this day. Her chief courtiers & contenders, are the old 
stercorarian & snaile creeper the Galenist, & the upstart 
single fangl'd Paracelsian; these two, like Peter 
and John, seeke to out-runne one another, till they 
have out-runne their Breath, their Books and the 
Constable, their Reason; if the good man ore-take 
them to see the peace kept, he bids them, with his 
staffe, his alone Charter and prerogative, stand; at 
which, like Paul and Barnabas, the contention's so 
hot, they evaporate in fumo, and one takes one 
way; and the other another, so that they come 
no agreement, but this, that 'tis all the mode d'Physick, 
every one to follow his own Inventions, & kill 
cum Privilegio. 
 
These two between them, would precipitate and 
[/12./] 
drive away the rationality in physick, from out the 
open-common, and upper region of Ingenuity and 
light of Nature, into the low marrish puddle inclosures 
of their own particular modes; and thereby 
have made it like a percipice, or razors edge, to 
walk on: In which game there are some of that 
temper, the pulse of whose art, skil and learning, 
beats after the old rugged mode of Galen, who had 
[/13./] 
rather be not good then not great Physitians; so that 
through an imbecillity of minde, not knowing how 
to make a departure from the gravity of their usuall 
pace, do oftentimes meet with and undergoe the 
lash of miserable experimentate miscarriage, by 
those twins, their grave obstinacy and formall ignorance. 
[/14./] 
 
Hence is that slow progresse in Physick! hence 
the lamentable and dreadful effects! that men are either 
[^p.6^] 
fatted up for the slaughter, or live walking 
ghosts, a life of languishment and misery; who 
think it mercy to knock them on the head, and 
cry out for an exit from the tragedy and more then 
back-burden of cruelties, their bloudy butchers act, 
and load upon their carcasses, the scene of all their 
[/15./] 
blew experiments and tryalls: which hath cast me 
perpendicular on the Pharmaceuticall part of Physick: 
Quæ enim in schola & Cathedra aliquando præter 
rationem, plerunque ad acuenda ingenia Juventutis in 
theoria proponuntur, sunt toleranda: Quæ vero. n praxi 
in perniciem ægrorum præscribuntur. potius execranda 
[/16./] 
& damnanda, quam admittenda esse, existimo. For 
unto us, and any Judgement that is not of a cast with 
those subjected to the tyranny of Custome and Prescription, 
it seems very grievous, that the studies, 
books, Orations, Councels, Conversations, Chairs 
and practices of Physitians sound of nothing but trifles 
and anxtious disputes; So that the whole huge 
[/17./] 
bulke of the art of healing, seemes now adaies to be 
moved upon the slender hinges of purgations, phlebotomy 
or blouding, scaring scarifications, boxing, cupping, 
baths, sweatings, fontanels, Cauteries; and in 
short, upon no other then the diminution of strength, 
and emaciations of the body, and abbreviations of 
the life, or exsiccation of Rheumes, the onely complement 
in Physick now adaies. 
 
To me seriously it is an amusement, not much on 
[/18./] 
this side of wonder, that our Europæan world, hath 
not had one sober consult with thought, to consider 
what postern door for evasion or any escape there 
will be left, that for so many hundred years down 
to posterity, they have been the apes and monkies, 
[^p.7^] 
the mimes and zanies of poor heathenish literalism, 
both in Philosophy and Physick, that they have sate 
like the dull præcisian pœdagogues to the ferula 
and pedantick Tyranny of the Stagirite, and ethnick 
Dispensatories, the mothes and Scarabe's of Physick: 
[/19./] 
For if the Archetype be not good which is in the understanding, 
the imitation of it will hardly prove capable 
of successe, or perpetuity; and if the constitution of 
remedies, in their bulke, in their entity, in their 
horizon, do square to an ill-affected, or ill-aspected 
position; what will not the diseases of them too, in 
their crudities, heterogenieties & impurities, add to the 
affliction and grief of our languishing brother? It's 
[/20./] 
against the haire for Nature to seek help from an Enemy, 
from a second disease, excentricke, as bad, 
and sometime worse then the Inherent, the foul disease 
of the medicine; whereby she must needs fall 
into a greater peril, then if she were to try the combate 
onely with the sicknesse: but she despiseth 
these dreames of Physitians, and doth loath them 
and fly from them: Insomuch it appears, that the 
[/21./] 
errors, ignorance and implicite confidence in Physicks 
is not the disease, or hectick of this age, but 
our very constitution: and not so much the constitution 
and temper of our remedies, and medicines, but 
the diseases of them, & sic e diametro, are to be complain'd 
of, and worth our serious teares: all which 
[/22./] 
we can referre justly to no other Author then Custome 
and her Adherents, which hath been extreamly disadvantagious 
to the whole round of Physick, and in 
nothing more, then in the Pharmapoietick part. Its 
an error tributary to the Custome-house of most 
[/23./] 
mens opinion to thinke there can be nothing found 
[^p.8^] 
in the Sciences, better then what hath been found 
out by the Ancients, and some conceive not so much 
as what the meaning of Physick is, or what they are 
good for. Now I know, I shall be sooner destitute 
of leisure, then of proofe sufficient to evince, that 
the too great Reverence born to Antiquity, is an error 
extreamly prejudicial to the advancement of 
Sciences, yea, so prejudiciall, that till it be rejected, 
it is impossible any new learning can be acquired; 
which may be one reason to prove, that we are far 
from knowing all we are capable of. But there is 
nothing wherein our necessity of acquiring new 
[/24./] 
knowledge, is more apparent then in physick: for 
although that no man doubts that God hath furnished 
this Earth with all things necessary for man to 
conserve him therein, in perfect health, untill an 
extream old age; and although there be nothing in 
the world so desired as these things, so that heretofore 
it hath been the studies of Kings and Sages; yet 
experience, and a few papers shew, we are so far from 
having it wholly, that oftentimes a man is chain'd 
to his bed by small diseases, which the most learned 
Physitians understand not, and onely make them 
rage more by their remedies, when they undertake 
to expell them; wherein the defect of their art, and 
the necessity of perfecting it, is so evident, that 
for those who understand not what the meaning of 
Physick is, it is enough to tell them, that it is the 
[/25./] 
Science which should teach so perfectly to understand 
the nature of man, and all things, that may 
serve him for nutriments or remedies, that it might 
be ease for him, thereby to exempt himself from all 
kinds of diseases. 
 
[^p.9^] 
It is to be lamented seriously, and the subject of 
[/26./] 
our serious sorrow it is, but more often of our wonder, 
when we consider, how ingeniously elaborate they 
are in other professions and mechanick arts, and how 
they dayly receive advancement, and ascend by the 
degrees of new discoveries, neerer towards their perfection; 
but in this of Physick, how cold, and dull 
they are in their most serious disquisitions hitherto, 
though charity towards our neighbour be pænally commended, 
that it is now in its Apogæo, or retrogradation, 
except it meet in Cazimi, in conjunction with 
the body of the sunne of truth: for all things have 
remain'd most obscure, and for the most part, 
most false, and those things which should chiefly 
conduce to the scope of healing, are not touched 
with so much as a finger. 
 
To what end tends the Anatomy of these two 
[/27./] 
thousand years, with those tedious lectures, if the 
Sanation of diseases, be not more happier at this 
day, then of old? what meanes that tearing and 
Cadaverous dissection of bodies, with that curious 
inspection and inquisition into the capillary 
veines, if we may not learn by the Errors of the 
Ancients, and if we may not make an emendation 
of those things that are past? 
 
Let it not be told in Gath, not publishd in Askelon 
[/28./] 
that the Genius of the English Nation, now 
made a Common-wealth, should be so low, so base, 
and so beggarly, to daunce after the pipe of meer 
whistlers, to be the Hinch-boys of Aristotle, and confine 
themselves to the principles of those, who are 
as a dark lanthorne in a thick night; as if we had 
no brick to make, without raking the straw, and 
[^p.10^] 
stubble of Galen, Hyppocrates, Mesine and other huddle 
of tongue Physitians; or as if the whole batch 
of medicines would be dome, without the Leaven of 
these Tare-gatherers. Have we no Smith in England 
that we must thus foot it over to the land of such 
uncircumcised Philistims? Its reported of Cæsar, 
that he on a day seeing wealthy strangers have little 
dogges and monkies in their armes, and that 
they made marvellous much of them, he asked them 
if the women of their Country had no Children? wisely 
reproving them by his question, in that they bestow'd 
their naturall love and affection upon bruit 
beasts, which they should have bestowed upon rationall 
Creatures. Antisthenes answered one very 
wisely, that told him Ilmenias was an excellent 
player of the flute, but he is a naughty man, said 
he, or else he could not be so cunning at the flute. 
I shall leave the application to whom it concerns. 
So Philip King on Macedon, said to his sonne Alexander, 
when at a feast he sung passing well, and 
like a Master in Musick; and art thou not asham'd 
sonne to sing so well? And thereto we hope, 
and are not overbold to suppose, that a time will 
[/29./] 
undoubtedly come, when it shall be a byword, and 
ignominy to be a good Physitian, that is, well read 
in Galen, and to be a proficient Galenist. Knowledge 
and learning without experience, is like the 
statue of Polyphemus, which wants an eye. The 
hand is the instrument of skill, and all contemplation. 
Such, (saies an Author) as speak of matters 
of state and government, but especially of matters 
of warre, say we, chiefly of matters of Physick, 
by the book, speak but as book knights, as the 
[^p.11^] 
French proverb termeth them, after the manner of the 
Grecians, who call him a book-Pilot, which hath not 
the sure and certain knowledge of the things that he 
speaks of; meaning thereby, that it is not for a man 
to trust to the understanding he hath gotten by reading 
[/30./] 
in things that consist in the deed doing where 
the hand is to be set to the worke: no more then 
the often hearing of men talke and reason of painting, 
or the disputing upon Colours, without taking 
the pencill in hand, can stand a man in any stead at 
all, to make him a good Painter. Let silence in the 
[/31./] 
Galenists then, be accounted as a sacrament, seeing 
their Parent in Physick, was nt at all known in 
pyrotechnal Philosophy: or Fhe poor man had never 
in all his life the happinesse to see so much as Rose-water. 
His ambition to be Principate in Physick, in 
such a poverty of knowledge, had bin a little excusable, 
if once at least, he had had the knowledge and 
skill, to extract any real principle out of any thing, 
and so might have proceeded, and been cring'd to, 
as Monarch of Physick; and not so easily expos'd 
himself, to be a laughing-stock to posterity and 
ingenious heads of his time, by his huge volumes 
and blew Comments on diseases. 
 
[/32./] 
I wish I had not occasion to bewaile, when in the 
concentrations of my mind, I am led to consider 
the falsity of that saying, not lesse vain and unsuccesful, 
then common; that when the Disease is 
known, it's halfe way to the cure; so that the other 
halfe, is left as the alone, and proper worke of medicines, 
but how unable, lamentable experience 
will testifie. This is that hath amus'd me, that the 
Schools in the Remedies of Diseases, both of simples 
[/33./] 
[^p.12^] 
and their mortarian labour of Compositions, have 
apply'd themselves to the threed-bare and shortcoated 
descriptions and discourses of Heat and Cold; 
both in the Crafts of things, with the Nature, Elements, 
temperament, humors, powers; that as out of 
the Monocracy and single-fol'd intemperature of the 
Liver, they have rendred us perhaps two hundred 
Diseases; so out of this Binary of Heat and Cold, they 
have builded their indispensable Dispensatory, and 
utter'd to us a thousand medicines, in antipodæan 
[/34./] 
position to the diseases of our Country. What 
more grosse and palpable thicke darknesse, and ignorance? 
As if the whole make of the universe, with 
such an infinity and alterity of Natures, were to be 
patch't up with the two fig-leaves, of Heat and Cold: 
As the preposterous ignorance of the Constitution 
[/35./] 
of man in generall, and of the quiddities, and Dihoties 
of things, as of that one the essence of the bloud, 
with that Diananizing of those Terra del' fogo's or 
incognita's, the scene of humours, beyond the line 
and America of Nature, and solid truth, hath obtenebrated 
the whole table of Physick, by undue indistinction; 
so hath it been a meanes to usher in 
that incongruous form of unadæquat remedies, and 
thereby to become a laborious cherisher, to devolve 
and heape up one huge halfe of all the languishing 
miseries and Calamities on man, since Adam. 
 
Behold, what can any of the whole systeme, or 
[/36./] 
batch of medicines of the shops do to that copious 
company of incurables, that they have rang'd and 
reckoned, as desperate: For of them they have given 
but a slight touch, and made a litle and maiden-like 
bashful mention, and introduced onely a 
[^p.13^] 
palliative cure, and left the rest to the providence, 
protection and compleating of Nature, and kitchin-Physick: 
so that in the end it appears, how full of 
[/37./] 
Calamity and desperation their engines are, too 
contemptible and weak to defend nature, or make 
any assault and battery upon the Eenemy; when 
they shall bring almost all diseases into the Catalogue 
of incurables, or turne them over to serve out their 
prenticeship, with the number of them, who are 
to be cured by change of Aire, diet and kitchin-Physick; 
that for the most part some of those [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
or Triacle sellers, or some old woman must cure, 
whom the great learning and skill of Physitians 
have left as uncurable, and then go about to excuse 
their ignorance and temerity, with a salva inobedientia 
ægrorum circa dietæ regulas non stricte servatas. 
Ah alas! how many absurdities and abuses are 
committed with these deceits, which to the world 
are not yet sufficiently known. 
 
But we have just cause to hope, at least to wish, 
[/38./] 
that Physitians will now at length suffer themselves 
to be instructed, from the autopticall unsuccessefulnesse 
of their own practice, what straw devices, 
what leane, idle sleights their thoughts have 
suggested to flatter their starv'd hopes: And to 
me it is an Argument not to be slighted, that the 
schools, and Physitians of our daies, begin to be sensible 
of the ignominy cast upon them, and their 
art, by the sling of vulgar tongues, from their infelicity 
of curing; that they now are perswaded, to 
look a little back to chymick remedies; that now 
there is a bridge from Galen to Paracelsus, and they 
can easily remove their Land-marks, and neglecting 
[^p.14^] 
the foundations of their own art, they can as indifferently 
and promiscuously use any chymick remedies, 
and most miserable poysons, as those, which 
their Dispensatories have describ'd, and taken upon 
trust; insomuch the Galenists fearing to be outgon, 
[/39./] 
what by the Collier Chymist and the Chymæricall 
contemplative Chymist, and perceiving the dulnesse 
both of the remedies, and Theorems of their Patron, 
can a little bend the hams suppled with the oyle of 
smooth and implicite credulity, and an idle lazy subscription, 
and have now stoop'd to that infatuated 
principle of Tartars of Paracelsus his own coin. 
 
This makes me see, that the Corrupt opinion and 
[/40./] 
indeavour of Politicks, have cast no little darknesse 
on the glory of gray-hair'd experience; have forsaken 
her standard principles, and have reduc'd mans mind 
from the greatnesse of works to the smalnesse of oblique 
and circulatory way of intelligence, speculation, 
the alone Patron of idlenesse, and lazinesse, 
[/41./] 
which weakly understood and violently put in practise, 
hath made a Shambles, rather then a Sanctuary, 
to butcher men violently, and devoure and destroy 
them insensibly, then give ease or succour. 
 
For there is nothing more hard, more inhumane 
[/42./] 
and full of Cruelty, among all humane Arts, through 
so many ages undertaken and usurp'd, then that art, 
which by a concentrick subscription doth make new 
experiments by the deaths of men, where the Earth 
covers the vices, the errors & fraud of its professors; 
who having never touch'd so much as to the bark & 
utter shell of knowledge, and although they creep 
on the bellies all daies of their lives, and feed upon 
the dust of the earh apt to be blown away by every 
[^p.15^] 
puffe of solid truth, yet think they are in the third 
heaven of Physick, and light of nature, and by reading 
of Galen and Aristotle, conceit they have rifled her 
rich Treasuries, trac'd her footsteps to a haire, and 
exactly survey'd the whole field and round of Nature. 
But verily they who think so, if they be such as 
have a minde large enough to take into their 
thougts a generall survey of naturall and humane 
things, would soon prove themselves in that opinion, 
far deceiv'd, and would soon tie up their 
tongues, discerning themselves all this while, like 
the high flown, selfe-conceited Laodicea. For while 
they presume and deem they keep the keyes of the 
science, do yet neither themselves enter into the 
Closet and inner parlour of Nature, nor will they admit 
willingly others that would. 
 
I thought once to have becalm'd this Sea of distraction 
[/43./] 
by the golden Trident of chymicall Theorem's, 
whom as a Lady of honour I have courted, and devoutly 
kiss'd, and to whom, I am not asham'd to 
profess, I ow my strict observance; but alas and alack 
for wo! I could find no rest here: I found too much of 
the leaven of Chrysippus, who was the first that pulled 
[/44./] 
Physick out of experience, & put it into opinion: 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], were 
a generation of men, in Plato's daies, and the line 
it seemes is not yet extinct. Because therefore I 
cannot foole my own credulity so far, as to sit down 
to an implicite conformity, coopt up and immur'd 
within these paper walls; and finding it a slaughterhouse 
of humanity, and to conspire to the extirpation 
of whole families and Common-wealths, (the 
best part of the world,) and seeing I plow in the 
[^p.16^] 
same field, I shall endeavour, and am resolv'd 
by the knife of chiroponall pyrotechny to cut the 
throat of these Petty-foggers, and let out the heart-bloud 
of the blinde Physick of this Nation, who 
deserves to be the leading card and do humbly conceive 
it nothing above my duty, either for the difficulty, 
[/45./] 
or the censure that may passe thereon, to communicate 
the sence and revolution of my thoughts, 
and Collections, and do offer them now in this generall 
labour of reformation, to the candid view of 
all good Christians, to the Schools, and all ingenious 
heads; especially, because I see it the hope of 
a handful of good and learned men, that this Crocodile, 
who seems to weepe for, and offer helpe to, 
the afflictions and languishing miseries of men, and 
yet destroies them, might spend its utmost date in 
this Common-Wealth; and that there might be 
some course taken in the body of Physick, in this 
Nation, that the squalid diseases of Physick and medicines 
might be cured; without which, no hopes of 
ever curing the sicknesses of the body of man: this 
therefore shall be the steerage, the taske and period 
of this discourse, to prove, 
 
That the whole mode, method and body of 
[/46./] 
Physick, as it is now prescribed and practised, with 
the desires of good men, groans for a reformation. 
 
I thinke, I shall have no just Cause to complain 
of any thing but that it is indeed too copious to be 
the matter of dispute, or a defence, rather to be 
yielded, as in the best ages, a thing of common reason, 
not of controversie. 
 
To write in that in which there is no beaten path, 
[/47./] 
[^p.17^] 
is most honourable, for he that leades, hath this 
advantage above others, if others follow him, he 
hath the glory of it, if not he hath the excuse of 
prejudice. 
 
He therefore who by adventuring shal be so happy, 
[/48./] 
as with succese to light the way of such an expedient 
liberty and truth, as this, shall restore the much 
abused, overwrong'd, and eclipsed glory and renown 
of Physick: and shall deserve of all apprehensive 
men (considering the ruines, the dangers 
and dreadfull effects, the ignorance, errors, abuses, 
impieties and cruelties of Physitians, in a thing of 
so great price, whose losse is irreparable, and most 
perilous to humane estate, which, for want of insight 
into, and reformation in the practise of Physick, 
have been committed in this, as well as other 
Common-wealths) shall deserve I say to be reck'ned 
among the publick Benefactors of civil and humane 
life, equal, nay above the Inventours of wine and 
oyle: for this, namely, health, is a farre dearer, farre 
nobler and more desireable cherishing to mans life, 
unworthily and unmercifully expos'd to ruine and 
danger. 
 
In which work, he whose courage can serve him 
to give the first onset, must look for two Hydra's of 
[/49./] 
several oppositions; the one, from them, who would 
exact the tunnage and poundage of all knowledge 
and skill, and excise all ingenuity and Autergie; 
who have sworn themselves to long custome, and 
the affected tedious scrible of Galen; whose whole 
spheare of reason, art, skill and practise, turnes in 
Galens Zenith, and his accomplices, will not out of 
the road: The other from those, whose formal ignorance 
[^p.18^] 
grosse and vulgar apprehensions, together 
with their grave obstinacy, ('twixt whom an entire 
league hath ever been held) conceit but low of Physick, 
whose cloudy and imperfect opticks, could never 
endure to pry into the Mysteries of Nature, and 
[/50./] 
in the work of healing, thinke they have all. This 
only is desir'd of them who are minded to judge 
hardly of thus maintaining that they would be stil, 
and heare all out, not thinke it equall to answer deliberate 
reason, with sodain heat and noise; remembring 
this, that many truths, now of reverend esteem 
and Credit, had their birth and beginning once 
from singular and private thoughts, while the most 
of men were otherwise possess'd, and had the fate 
at first to be generally exploded and exclaim'd on, 
by many violent opposers: Neverthelesse it shall 
be here sought by due waies and means to reclaim, 
and bring it from under the rubbish of gentilish and 
anarchicall principles, into the Monarchy of pyrotechnall 
experience. Yet would we not be mistaken, 
[/51./] 
to be thought for stiffe pleading for a confus'd abolishing 
of these things, as the Rabble demolish Images, 
in the zeale of their hammers oft violating 
the sepulchres of good men; or rudely break up, not 
go through open doors. 
 
[/52./] 
The Apollinian science then, or art of Physick, is 
every where brought upon the Stage; and made 
the laughing-stock of the sick-brain'd vulgar; 
because Physitians, who have heterodogmatiz'd, and 
deviated from the ancient beaten path of clear reason 
[/53./] 
and experience, put no distinction between the 
venerable grey-haires of ancient Physick, and them 
who weare her honourable silver livery, from the 
[^p.19^] 
old scurff of Galen and his accomplices, benighted 
to the clouds of ignorance, and that Tatterdemalion 
Linostema of Peripatetical & Galenical predicaments 
of qualities; whereby, to heads of a larger size, 
they seem to have put out their own eyes, and willingly 
subject themselves, like Mill-horses to grind 
in the Mill-house of custome and Tradition, and aforehand, 
to have stak'd themselves to a resolution 
to confine to the Custome of the Schools, and sit 
down to a precise Conformity, to lap up the prodigious 
vomits of Aristotle, Galen and other illiterate 
Ethnicks, and in effect to prescribe all the heads of 
the present age, as Pupils to the dull and doting advisoes 
of the ancient, precedent Paper-stuffers; and 
then no lesse to say, as in supernaturall things they 
are wont, so in naturall, to make it a kind of blasphemy, 
at least presumption, to step one haires 
breadth from the cry'd up and vulgar receiv'd 
way: So hardly in good sooth can the dotage of those 
who dwell upon antiquity, allow present times any share 
[/54./] 
of wisdome or skill. For we are not overbold to suppose 
what they read, they beleeve, and what they 
beleeve, they leave to the confection of an Apothecary 
and family, without any manuall or mechanick 
experiment. For who among the formost of them, 
can justifie their positions and rules by practise; not 
by their hands, but fancies. Hence it is that every 
druggist and old woman, with Mother Mid-night, and 
of every occupation sally forth, and dare to intrude 
themselves into the practise of Physick, putting an 
affront upon Physitians, because oftimes in many 
things they excell them. For of old they are wont 
to reserve something to themselves, as a pledge of 
[^p.20^] 
their fame and family: But after that the slothful and 
lazy disquisitions of Physitians prevail'd, & the itch 
of Gain turn'd Physick into a plow, to make long furrow's 
on the backs of poor mortals, by the just judgment 
of God all things went to wrack. 
 
The Schools will have the shuffling and cutting 
[/55./] 
of the Cards, and the Colledge drawes the choice of 
physitians, so that the whole pack of those that by them 
are accounted worthy, are they who have subscrib'd 
to the ignorance and unskilfulnesse of Ethnicks; that 
the Cathedrall of all reason, learning, skill, Philosophy 
and all judgement, might vail to them, and 
they keep the keyes; and mans life it selfe should be 
committed to them. So that if he be but an Academick, 
though a meer mammothrept, and perhaps 
a Midas, if they can but hide his two ambitious eares, 
which they can easily doe, by his implicite conformity, 
he shall passe for Cathedrall Doctor, a Physitian 
in folio, with an imprimatur on his back, as if 
he were the microcosmall Councell of State's chief 
Physitian, cum privilegio custod. salutis populi: so 
that upon the posts, and frontispeice of the medicall 
conclave is written like that of Plato's Academy, 
with a Nemo huc ingrediatur nisi & c. Whereby all others 
are like a pawn at Chesse, fill up the Room, and 
that's all. This is now handed down to us Europæans, 
and is in possession and practise among English men, 
that hath carry'd away the bayes from all others, that 
they will not be befool'd of their liberties, nor 
blinded in their understandings, by any devise: 
so that charity is grown cold, and sloth introduc'd 
under a more safer seal, and long use hath confirm'd 
this begotten ignorance, pretending the right 
[^p.21^] 
of prescription. And we wish it doe not prove a 
kind of staple merchandize, to be seal'd and stamp'd 
like our Broad-cloth, or Wool-packs; and that Art and 
Ingenuity become not tributary to the Custome-house 
of error, opinion and Customes, and that the Factors 
or Farmers thereof, do not so monopolize, or 
monarchize, to put truth at the bottom of the sack, 
and their own inventions at the sacks mouth; wherby 
God should withdraw his gifts, and those which 
[/56./] 
he hath given to others, continue. The Apostle 
Paul would have widows to be honour'd, that 
were widows indeed, in good works; according 
to the command, which hath ordain'd the Physitian 
to be honour'd, who shall truly be a Physitian in 
good works, and so shall testifie that he is created, 
and chosen of God; whose works shall follow him, 
worthy of his vocation, as letters patents, as signs 
and merits of his honour: which text being consider'd 
we find honour to be appointed to the Physitian 
because of necessity; which necessity doth presuppose 
bringing forth fruit, otherwise in vain: 
not that the force of the precept, runs so in necessity, 
as, that when a sound man doth not need a Physitian, 
that then he is to be honour'd: For then a 
Judge, Councellor, Lawyer, Souldier, Husbandman, 
Weaver; & c. should be prescribed to be honour'd, 
by the same right of necessity. Honour 
therefore is ordain'd to the Physitian, created by 
the goodnesse of the highest for the necessity of the 
sick, to heal them: But the necessities of a souldier, 
Judge, Executioner, weaver, & c. are not consider'd, 
as chosen by God, but as promoted by men, 
to execute those offices, that are requisit, and than 
from the malice of men. 
 
[^p.22^] 
There is a four fold mist of ignorance, hath enter'd 
[/57./] 
all at once, into the medicall profession, and 
hath left it without honour; namely, the ignorance 
of causes, the remedy, the manner of making it, 
and coaptation of it. Truly as pyrotechny doth open 
bodies before our eyes, that are lock'd; so also 
it opens the gate unto naturall Philosophy. Under the 
ignorance and sloth of the Schools, the true medicine 
hath lurk'd so depress'd, that that which 
should have brought the greatest light unto the Physitian, 
seeing the whole work is accounted mechanick; 
the want whereof is his blindness, and unskilfulnesse, 
that through pride and long Custome, is 
trensferr'd out of his own hands, into the hands of 
an Apothecary and his servants; that now he sees not 
with his own eyes, nor handles with his own hands, 
nor understands with his own Intellect and judgement, 
so that here lyes the mystery of iniquity. 
 
Our pardon for this plain-dealing, is sued out 
[/58./] 
in forma R. P. both in the very name, nature, 
right constitution and right reformation of it; as 
also from the effect of the disputation, when it 
comes in competition with life, with diseases, with 
my neighbour, my Friend, my brother, my vocation, 
with the truth, with good, with hurt, with 
things so truly serious, and of such moment. For 
I propound not to my self the thanks or favour 
of any man, having also learn'd to runne thorow 
good report, & evil report. For my own understanding 
tells me, that the Art of Physick hath stood a 
long time at a stay, as is a shame to think; without any 
progresse made; because we had rather stand 
to, and bring honour to, and deck and polish the 
[^p.23^] 
Inventions of Forreigners, Greeks, Barbarians and 
Ethnicks. In the mean while there's a metamorphosis 
[/59./] 
in the whole systeme of diseases; new diseases arise, 
which Galen and Hippocrates never knew; and 
the old ones with stranger and crueller symptomes; 
for they rise again disguis'd therefore appear illegitimate, 
not answering to the descriptions of the 
former: And that such a thing as this should stand 
at a stay, without any progresse, is both shame and 
lamentation; while our healths and lives call greatly 
for an increase of the knowledge of healing. How 
much, and to what end hath that lazy, dull and 
ungenerous kind of Physitians hindred the light of 
Physick, from breaking forth, who are wise only 
from anothers Comment, and deny, that the art 
can encrease above what they know: And therefore 
what they know not, they drive with a certain 
desperation, into the Catalogue of incurable. As 
if our Ancestours resting places, were to be like Hercules 
pillars, inscrib'd with a Ne plus ultra; as if they 
had attain'd to the Meridian of all knowledg, by the 
fix'd North-pole of all perfection; and on that Axletree 
must turn the whole Globe of posterities knowledge, 
with the whole Hierarchy of lesser and greater increasings: 
as if the wits and spirits of the present times 
would serve for nothing, but to go a wool-gathering 
in the wildernesse or wild fields of the foregoing 
sheep-shearers; or were fit for nothing, but to sit with 
their hands in their pockets, in a lazy and implicite 
conformity to this medical statue of Æsculapius; 
and rather then to correct, adde, encrease, perfect, 
purg and reform the present mode and practise, had 
rather subscribe to it, and been obedient son of the 
[^p.24^] 
former Physick-fathers, believe it cannot be amended, 
or its very difficult to goe about, and the way is not 
clear, and such like obstacles as these they put; as 
if the inventions of our Grand-fathers had ramm'd up 
the way of our own industry, and had occluded the 
Treasuries of wisdome; or as if she had now forsaken 
the thirsty and laborious inquirer, to dwell against 
her nature with the arrogant and shallow babler. 
Such is the sweetnesse of gain, that every one brags 
of, and with love admires their contusions and miscellanies 
of medicines, which they call magistrall 
Receits: But the more secret things, which in times 
past rendred Physitians that were lovers of labour 
very famous, by the stupify'd drousinesse of Physitians, 
contracted by the opium of dull ignorance and 
sloth, are nowslipp'd into the hands of Apothecaries, 
and old women. 
 
[/60./] 
The first that we meet with, who will needs be 
Physitians are those, who truly are not educated 
and instructed to this, but prompt of nature, whose 
Genius leads them to it, say they, and are cut out, 
and are configurated for it, whose bare inclination, 
and the tickling itch of gain is the Ascendant, daring 
any thing, which they have heard to have profited 
others, without any disquisition, cognition, 
and discrimination of causes: For thence have almost 
all the experiments of the Schools flow'd 
forth: which Galen hath confirm'd by the example 
of his master Quintius. For making experiments 
by the deaths of men, the Schools call their graduats 
most expert. Others, that are vulgar Physitians, 
had rather heal vulgar only, and to these they give 
their Councells: some also of favour only, and being 
[^p.25^] 
ask'd; but the most part for the ambition of 
honour that they might be esteem'd as wise men, possesse 
this innate kind of vice. Of the same sort are 
those deceivers, who would seem to be rich, and 
therefore give all their ministrations gratis, to the 
destrution or casuall health of people. To these succeed 
they, who covet not moneys, but gifts, lest 
they should seem below the condition of great and 
noble men, and deserve nothing they say, but do it 
for a common good. The like to these are they, 
who confesse truly that they are not Physitians, but 
have great skill in Physick, and have their secrets 
and receits from Kings, Emperours, Queens and great 
Ladies: For these are wont to suborn the middle 
sort of people, whoch do extoll the price of the medicine. 
Others there are who turn themselves into 
Physitians, who have been old Souldiers, and now 
left the warres, brag of, and shew their wounds, 
and thereby think, and perswade themselves they 
have got great experience. Some of the Clergy also, 
Priests and poor Scholars, that have nothing else to 
do must now turn Physitians. Some silenc'd ministers 
and outed of their benefices, lay hold upon 
Physick, and commit force and violence to her 
body, that if one fails, t'other may hold, and think 
their Latin, and their Coat, the grand Charter, to 
entitle them to the practise in Physick. There are 
a generation also who pretend to Astrology, Chiromancy, 
(and why not to Coscinomancy) to Physiognomy too, 
dare tamper with Physick, and by schemes, Angles, 
and Configuraions predict not only diseases, but the 
Cure also, and so thinke themselves able Physitians, 
and are rather, because they are now masters of Art, 
[^p.26^] 
in, and instituted by, the heavenly Academy, and 
Colledge of stars. Others scrible upon paper, (not 
the innoxious words of Salomon,) but Characters, 
charms as they call them, whereby Diseases, as well 
as Devils are chas'd away, and crosse themselves before 
and behind, least the Devil should take him away, 
writing powerfull words. There are also, 
who well known in divers Idioms, and pretend to 
speak Chaldiack, Arabick or Dalmatick, and are loden 
with many arts; at last vaunt only de mathesi or historiis: 
Many of these know nothing lesse then to 
make the Phylosopher's stone, and carry about them 
propagable mines with a perpetuall ferment. There 
are they again who pretend to be baptiz'd Jewes 
(more wicked then the not baptiz'd) who have 
learn'd from the Kabala to mortifie mercury divers 
wayes, and also to prepare poysons variously, 
which are good against all diseases, and many more. 
They brag of the Hebrew tongue to contain the fundaments 
of all sciences, and the grand secrets of 
States, and Common-Wealths, and are big with 
the foreknowledge of futures: They often cite their 
Rabbines, the book of Nebolohu, with the little key 
of Salomon, from whence they can read things past, 
as well as to come. Others also assert the medicall 
art to be hereditary, and to run in the line of their 
own progeny although they be all fools or Knaves. And 
then at last if these cannot be accounted of among 
men, they have a sure Card they think to play, and 
to be sure they will be receiv'd among women; and 
to that end brag of the cosmetick faculty, of sweet 
oyntments, oyles and perfumes; and the art to preserve 
their beauty, or repair it if ruin'd: And a 
[^p.27^] 
hundred to one, if they have not a fling at the Cælestiall 
stone too, of Armenia, whereby they can cure 
a large catalogue of diseases: for these are cut out 
of the same hide with Greeks and Jews; any thing 
will serve, to cheat the credulous vulgar of their 
money, when it's known to all that know any thing 
of Physick, that the divine blew stone, is but Roman 
vitriol, that is to be had at every Druggist and 
Apothecarie shops, and is us'd by every horse-leach. 
There is also a fugitive kind of men from the family 
of the Chymists, who while they brag of select and 
precious things, sell nothing lesse then poysons, 
and take all liberty of lying to the deluded ignorants: 
These fugitives being apostate Idiots from the 
Chymists furnaces. But the Schools do with greater 
security, and above all, with a most liberall authority 
impose their things upon mortalls. For when 
we shall come to shew by the inevitable determination 
of truth, that they have been hitherto ignorant 
of the knowledge of diseases, and their remedies, 
not knowing the essence of a remedie, in its true nature, 
end and use; as also ignorant of the knowledge 
of simples. (as we shal shew anon) their preparation, 
conjunction, and appropriation: In the mean 
time, they promote their Schollars: This man because 
he hath Latin and Greek, a Doctor or Chirurgian 
to his Father: Another because he is made a 
master of Arts, hath heard and read lectures: Another 
also because he holds to Euclid's elements, and 
brags he is for him; or that he hath learn'd to dispute 
or rather scold from Aristotle: Another hath 
his call to practise Physick, from his daily reading 
of books, and subtile problematicall disputing upon 
every proposition; so that in three years they are 
[^p.28^] 
chang'd into very learned men: Wherefore they 
read the voluminous books of Galen, Avicen and 
the interpreters. Then they revolve Herballs, wherein 
the shapes of herbs are decipher'd to the life; 
the which if they have not yet known very 
well, they are sent to the shops, and gatherers of 
simples, with this mandate, that when they have 
well known the effigies of the simples, they may return 
to their lections, which, with much and long 
study they have collected out of divers Authors, that 
they may learn the powers of simples and compounds 
together with their applications: They see 
also cadaverous sections, and hear and learn the Galenicall 
Lurrey, the method of healing, the use of the 
parts and differences of pulses, and then when they 
have thus learn'd to sol-fa, they lanch forth into the 
sea of diseases to cure them, with that confidence 
and presumption, as if they had been at it a score of 
years, and look for salutations 12 score off. We pitty 
the miserable condition of mankind obnoxious to 
so many internall calamities, and expos'd to so mauy 
external outrages and violences of such ignorant 
pretenders; who when they have cruelly kill'd any 
Magistrate or great man, under the black and dismall 
rules of the Schools, they fly to their 
Sanctuary, and take the liberty and boldnesse, as of 
law, to bring him to, and call it the incurablenesse 
of his disease, and every where have their patrons 
and accomplices: So much more miserably do 
poor mortals trust to them, because they hide their 
ignorance among the vulgar, under the cloak of promotion 
and swearing; because they swear they will 
faithfully help infirmities, which alas they are wholy 
[^p.29^] 
ignorant of, as also of the remedy; yea, that 
Hercules of Physick, Galen, their Prince, hath not 
[/61./] 
shewn one medicine, that is not borrow'd from Empiricks, 
howsoever he triumphs in hin blew, and 
childish Throry of complexions and degrees, tam secundum 
genera, quam loca. For Quintius Galens master, 
was wholly an Empirick, and every where 
implor'd by his Scholar. Let not the Schools then 
contemn practise and experience; but fling away 
their pride and sloth, and it's easie to cure that disease 
among them, namely, the uncurablenesse 
of diseases. By this means shall the power and vertue 
[/62./] 
of healing stand upright under every weight; 
that is, all diseases with her are of one price, and 
no diminution can be made by any disease. For God 
as he hath not made death, so neither doth he rejoice 
in the perdition of the living: For he made all Nations 
of the world easie to be cur'd, nor is there an exterminating 
medicine. It may be granted, that sometimes 
some alimentary diseases may be healed by the 
remedies of the shops, to wit, they which admit 
of spontaneous consumptions, and easie resolutions: 
but in dangerous, difficult, strong diseases, in which 
are fixt and chronicall roots, the use of them does 
more hurt then good. Hippocrates truly left to posterity, 
the inquisition of higher remedies; because 
our Ancestors liv'd in more happy Ages. But the 
Schools and Physitians of an idle and lazy nature, 
have not respected the greater necessities of mortals, 
but content with Galen and his Quintius, have not 
perceiv'd the defects of mortalls, seeing gain hath 
carryed them away and they are sure to have it, 
whatsoever the event be. To this carelesnesse and 
[^p.30^] 
sloth of theirs is witnesse, that they have not yet 
once thought of a medicine for the stone, nor a poor 
Ague, or pain of the teeth. 
 
The powers of things, as well as the thundring 
[/63./] 
accusations of the sick, doe bespeak their ignorance: 
as if the powers and vertues of medicine, were put into 
things by Nature, and the God of Nature, only as 
a box to contain them, and not to be open'd, and their 
excellencies to be communicated. That Science then, 
which enables men to look thorow the shop of medicine, 
[/64./] 
the topick tabernacle of naturall powers, and 
teaches to unlock bodies that are shut, and to draw 
forth their hidden vertues, is not peculiar to the family 
of Pharmacopolists, nor truly is the Pharmaceutick 
part a hand-maid to it (as is the talk of ignorants) 
but is a powerfull _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ecmarsis of naturall history. 
 
[/65./] 
For Pharmacy truly began at first from the Merchants 
of simples, and collectors of herbs; but then 
when the Physitians perceiv'd, that it was not fit for 
every one to boyl, condite and prepare simples therefore 
that busines also, was committed to the seller of 
simples. In the mean while the more choice and 
secret things, Physitians kept to themselves, whereby 
they purchas'd honour to their posterity. But at 
length the sloth of Physitians increasing, they were 
content to run thorow the streets, from house to 
house, to make a seat of gain, by their frequency of 
visitations: Then at length chopt in Dispensatories, 
and select formes, that they should be kept in the 
shops, and set to sale, rather for expedition then 
propriety: whence at last Physitians joyning compounds 
with compounds, they administred to the 
sick sometimes a miscellany of a thousand simples, 
[^p.31^] 
that if one would not helpe, anothe should; at least, 
they would be sure to excuse themselves, because 
they had carryed on the cure of the sick, according 
to prescrib'd rules. This is the medicining at this 
day, from which how much the chymick Philosophy 
differs, they know who have but saluted the 
same at the threshold, and but warm'd at the hermetick 
fire. 
 
Before the threshold of the shop, we cannot chuse 
[/66./] 
but have a fling at the Describers of Simples. For 
though there be no field more spacious, plentifull 
and pleasant on the whole face of Earth, nor 
where the minde may be more intent or delighted, 
then in the matter of herbs and vegetables, the Earths 
Embroidery, and dame-Natures revels, when in her 
Virgin vernall beauty, she bids Holy-day and rants 
it in her great silken sinople ward-robe of sundry 
vestments, bestudded with the Pearls and Diamonds 
of lovely Flowers, yet notwithstanding lesse progresse 
hath hardly been made elsewhere. For the 
Arabians, Gentiles, Barbarians, salvages, and Indians, 
[/67./] 
do more vigilantly and judicially observe their 
simples and things growing among them, then all 
the Europæan world besides. Since, even from the daies 
of Plato (wherein Dioscorides a military man lived) 
there hath almost nothing bin added to the vegetable 
Common-wealth, or matter of herbs, but very 
much taken away, and the Tyranny of we know not 
what strang Monsters of Physick introduc'd. Galen like 
[/68./] 
a Plagiary and sneaking Filcher, suppressing the name 
of Dioscorides, makes use of his words, which Pliny 
in the mean time besprinkles with many trifles, as 
being of a poor and shallow judgement, and unable 
[^p.32^] 
to distinguish that which is likely from that 
which is true, and that which is false; by which 
means he heaped up a multitude of things, that by 
the bulk of his book, he might equallize the fulnesse 
of his name. But to this very day, even the more 
learned and leading part of Physitians, do as yet hold 
a Logomachie and anxiously dispute only about the 
shapes and names of Herbs. As if when the Countenance 
were known, we should think the Powers did 
not openly speak unto them; the powers I say, first 
deliver'd by Dioscorides: so that the medicall power, 
seemeth to have arrived at her perfection, in 
the first Author. In the mean time those things that 
were of greatest moment have been neglected hitherto. 
 
But the Neotericks and more modern Authors, have 
[/69./] 
begun to distinguish Herbs into sexes, and thinking 
that thereby they have discover'd many things, they 
have yet complain'd that these things have been 
veil'd: As if Nature did labour in jest, and not 
in earnest, being solicitous of the sex, whereas she 
contenteth her self with that which is androgynous 
and promiscuous. For the sex respects nothing but 
generation, and not the operation and relation of 
pairs: Wherefore to the end that she who wholy referr'd 
her self to certain ends, known to her Creator, 
might not frame one jot or title in vain, wheresoever 
there was no need of the marks of sexes for generation 
in the composure of things, she quite omitted 
them. But if of two simples the one is stronger 
or rougher then the other, that denoteth not the sex, 
but the degree of rougher or gentler motion; for 
by longsoft motion, and circulation that is moderate; 
[^p.33^] 
heat, sharpnesse, roughnesse, or what ever 
else is presented to the Pentarchy of sences, as extream 
and violent, is taken away; and becometh 
a subject wholly subdu'd to the scepter of our Nature, 
and yields a sweet smelling savour: for a 
fragrant smel is nothing else then a sharp smel, when 
it is moderate. Example of Pepper and Euphorbium; 
of rough and violent motions, and therefore have 
no fragrant smell. While therefore the same simple 
rotteth, and is changed into little animals, these 
are not of one, but of both sexes; which truly would 
not come to passe if those simples had already a sex 
or sexuall powers within them. For of the same 
numericall herb, insects, as well of the male, as of 
the female sex, are promiscuously bred. 
 
[/70./] 
There hath also arisen other sects afterwards, 
who observed the signatures, as it were a kind of 
Palmistry in Herbs; and this conceit hath been very 
much promoted by the root of Satyrion: And by 
means of this chiefly have they introduc'd scientia 
signata, or Anatomia effata; that is, new-fangl'd 
names, and swelling titles, to gloze their fopperies. 
For me, I am assured by faith, that neither is 
man the Image of Nature, nor Nature the Image of 
man. God out of the eternall providence of his 
Goodnesse and wisdome, hath enough and more 
then enough provided for necessities to come. He 
made and endowed simples to the design'd uses of all 
necessities; that is, he compos'd and directed them 
to the end and scope of necessities: And therefore 
we may very lawfully and deservedly be excus'd, 
if we conceive the whole businesse of the Conquest of 
diseases, lies upon the shoulders and single stock of 
[^p.34^] 
simples in their right preparation for Physick; nay, 
we are bound to beleeve that simples in their simplicities, 
are sufficient for the Cure of all diseases: 
wherefore we ought, and more becoming it is to us 
of this Nation, to employ more study in the enquiry 
of their vertues, then in discussion of problems 
concerning them, since in simples, that is, in their 
right knowledge and Philosophicall preparation, is the 
perfect cure and remedy of all diseases; and consequently 
Dispensatories, the monument of the lazy Liturgy 
of Physitians, and other Ethnick Directories, 
endeavouring to compound, confound and confect 
many medicines, make but a Hodge-potch though 
sew'd in with sweet broth, their syrups; and though 
they start, and hotly pursue the Game of simples, 
yet they loose their sent, grow lazy, undoe all, and 
with a secret kinde of blasphemy go about to supply 
the divine insufficiency: And let us be excus'd 
to pause a little, and bethink us every way round 
e're we lay such a flat Solecisme upon the gracious 
and most benigne bounty of God. Hence Paracelsus 
writeth to the Chirurgians; to what purpose do 
you superadde vineger to the root of Comfrey, or bole, 
or such like balefull additaments, while God hath 
compos'd this simple sufficient to cure the fracture of 
the bones? Whatsoever thou shalt adde to it, is 
done as it were to make God subject to thy correction. 
Thou art foully mistaken. In like manner 
we conceive that God hath sufficiently and perfectly 
compos'd in simples the compleat remedies of 
whatsoever diseases. 
 
[/71./] 
Finally upon sure grounds we know that we 
have no Anatomicall kindred with the Archevs of 
[^p.35^] 
vegetables, whether we respect the whole or the 
parts: For the endowments of simples are from the 
Creation, and not from the usurpation of possession. 
For the proprieties were in herbs, before sin, death 
and necessity. Besides we believe that God doth 
give the knowledge of simples to whom he will, out 
of supernaturall grace, and not by the signes of Nature. 
For what Chiromantick kindred with the 
Pleuresy hath a boars-tusk, goats-bloud, bulls-pizle, 
horse-dung or the herb daisie? Or what signature 
have those simples common to them? Indeed I 
praise my Lord, who primarily created all things to 
his glory, before there were any diseases, nor did 
he marke the simples by reason of the diseases that 
might afterwards happen, but for the beauty of the 
Universe, whence ariseth honour to the Lord. 
 
There have not likewise been wanting, who 
[/72./] 
have compris'd the immense Catalogue of diseases, 
in the signes of the Zodiack, as Bartholomæus Carichterus 
for one, whose number being too narrow, they 
enlarged every one of the signs into a triple section; 
so that they divided all the powers of Herbs into 
thirty six, and enclos'd them in a narrow room. 
There are they also who square the powers, vertues, 
aspects and applications in the Horizon of herbs to diseases, 
from certain positions of Heaven, emitting 
some vertue which moveth every thing in the kind, 
which yet is divers from the circular motion it self; 
or else they make them lesse efficacious, that is, in 
plain English ineffectual: And so they have denominated 
some herbs solar and some lunar, and such like 
toies put into great words, as that mechanick experimentator 
hath it in his Sylva Sylvarum.
