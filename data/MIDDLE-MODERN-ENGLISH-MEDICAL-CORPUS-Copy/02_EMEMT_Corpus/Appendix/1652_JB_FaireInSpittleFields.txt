[}A FAIRE 
in Spittle Fields, where the Astrologers 
Knavery, is exposed to the view. And their Trinkets to 
all that will see for their Love, and buy for 
their Money.}] 
 
UPou a time, whose date hath unaware 
Slip't my remembrance; the Astrologers, 
Began to prate, as if the world should see 
Some sudden change, or great Catastrophy. 
Each Libel spoke a great Eclips to come, 
The Scourge of Europe, and the fall of Rome; 
The amazement of spectators, great affright, 
Terrour of Mortals, and a day like night. 
Yea, some presum'd to say the Eclips would be 
So wonderful as that obscurity 
Which spread earth's superficies, and befel, 
At the Jews slaughtering of Emanuel. 
[^p.2^] [^Original misnumbered as p.4.^] 
These and the like things being published 
Abroad in Pamphlets, many minds were led 
To strang conceits, thinking each day a year, 
Till the long-look'd for Munday should appear. 
But he that makes the drooping spirits glad, 
That frasterats Tokens, makes Diviners mad, 
Whose mighty wisdom ruleth all things made 
The Sun shine glorious, no Cimmerian shade, 
Made dark our dwellings; their predictions fail'd 
Their Tales prov'd fables, and the People rail'd 
Against these Jugglers, whose prevarications 
Had filld their minds with such vain expectations; 
Th' Astrologe_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s, perceiving it would try, 
In one poore day to vent their Foolery. 
Wherefore resolve to constitute a Faire, 
In Spittle-Fields, exposing each mans ware 
To publick view; and 'ere a full decay, 
Having once sould their Trinkets, post away. 
The time being now at hand, that hasty Sun 
Which lately scorch'd their credit had begun, 
His daily course; when loe, a Cryer stands 
Vttering with lowd voice, and erected hands 
(Indeed his hands were lifted up on High, 
Because the matter much concern'd the Skie. 
 
O-yes, will will any buy, 
The knick-knacks of Astrology. 
Quircks and Quillets, such-like things 
Rare inventions, waxen wings, 
[^p.3^] [^Original misnumbered as p.5.^] 
To soar above ler them repair. 
And purchase what they want in Spittle Fair 
 
No sooner had he thus divulg'd this Note, 
Through the wide cranney of his hollow throat, 
But every Pedler furnished his Stall, 
With prity whimsies to be sold; though all, 
Demurr'd a while, and fix't their eyes upon, 
Their Captain General, who thus begun; 
 
Good people, 
Stand not amaz'd at this unusual Fair, 
'Tis our Preservative against Dispair. 
And which must secure us by and by 
From the swift vengeance of a Hue and Cry. 
 
Come then before the lowest of my fall, 
And buy these writings Astrologicall. 
Loe her's an Introduction, 'tis as rare, 
A peece as ever breath'd Celestial Aire. 
By it are Questions of all sizes stated 
By it Nativeties are Calculated. 
The Delphick God ne're did such tricks as these. 
It is the worlds great Ephimerides. 
 
Also, I have a Libel that wil show 
Whether we shall have Monarchy or no. 
And at the end whereof there is prefixt 
Rats, Dragons, Lions, with a thousand tricks. 
To please mens fancys, news of peace and strife 
Besides King Charles his Character and life. 
He'rs Anus Teneborus; buy it will yee 
[^p.4^] [^Original misnumbered as p.6.^] 
Tis a rare piece Compos'd by Mr. Lillie. 
These and some more I have, yet none will buy 
The famous Gew-gawes of Astrollogy. Exit. 
 
Next to him entr'd one whose active shape, 
Had some assimulation with an Ape. 
On whom a Doctur (pleas'd with what he Spoke) 
In curtesie, bestow'd a velvet Cloke, 
Which being metamorphes't to a Iacket 
Under the thread-bare skirts he brought a Pacquet, 
With Medicables fraught; though some deny 
To couple Phuisick with Astrollogy. 
This man indee's the Viccar of St. Fools, 
Yet contradicts Phisitions and the Schoolls, 
And with a handful of conceited knowledge. 
Dare challenge all the Doctors in the Colledge: 
Absurdly and presumptuously of late 
Vsurp't the Pulpit, when intoxicate. 
And now as Master of the Fair-place: this, 
His worship utter'd with an Emphasis, 
What lack ye Gentlemen, come buy this Spell 
Twill fetch grand Pluto from the nether Hell. 
Buy this Conjuring Circle which of late 
Preserv'd the Exorcist, Tapers consecrate 
With Garments wash't: bid money though but little, 
For night coms on, and we must leave the Spittle. 
Oh, fie upon't, how these dull markets plague us, 
Happy were I to speak with Simon Magus. 
How well my Portage, would fit him to carry, 
[^p.5^] [^Original misnumbered as p.7.^] 
And our brave books repleate his Library? 
 
Ther's much more in my Pack which I'le not ope, 
Since my condition is so void of hope. 
Her's my last work, Catastrophe Magnatum, 
And her's Receits are sealed with Probatum. 
Her's a Fools Cap lin'd with a Knavish brain, 
And Cripsies Riddles, but 'tis all in vain. 
Wherefore I am resolv'd to smoke my Nose, 
Then straight way to the Fuddling-School he goes. 
Where you may finde him sucking when he list, 
The fuming Pipe, or play the Organist. 
 
These two were chief, but yet annother came, 
Of great esteem, whom I forbear to name, 
A man well known, whose face would fright a Rasor 
He much resembled stern-lookt Abbumasor. 
Crowding into the middest of the throng 
Cries out, who is it that hath done us wrong. 
Unluckey starrs, that would not let us know, 
The neere approach of our sad overthrow. 
But in revenge thereof I meane to fell, 
The twelve fair Houses where the Plannets dwell. 
I'le sell the whole reversion of my pack, 
Who buyes these twelve Signes of the Zodiak. 
Besides each years Predictive Almanack. 
My treasure far exceeds the Golden Feece, 
And her's good Fortunes sould for pence a peece. 
Nay more! I have the starry Globe! See heere, 
Will this not tempt you; a Celestiall Spheare. 
[^p.6^] [^Original misnumbered as p.8.^] 
Me-thinks 'tis strange the spangles of the Sky, 
Are to be sould, and yet ther's none will buy. 
 
This said: as all the rest had don before, 
He trust his Pack, put up, and was seen no more. 
Within the Fair-place, though to tell you plain, 
The man I think, lives now in Creed-church Lane 
 
Those were the Grandees, but a number more, 
(Whom I forbeare to mention) brought their store, 
To this great Fair, and every man was glad, 
To sell those simple whimsies which he had. 
But none would buy, wherefore they left the faire 
While peoples shouts, might seeme to rent the aire. 
 
This the World's great Moon Calfe Di'd 
Being in the hight of pride.
