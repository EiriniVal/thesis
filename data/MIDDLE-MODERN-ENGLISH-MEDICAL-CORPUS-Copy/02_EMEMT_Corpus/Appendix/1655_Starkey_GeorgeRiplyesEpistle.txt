[}SIR 
GEORGE RIPLYE'S 
EPISTLE TO 
King Edward unfolded.}] 
 
THis Epistle as it was 
imediately written 
to a King, who was 
in his generation, 
both wise and valiant, 
so it doth 
comprise the whole secret, both 
learnedly described, and yet Artificially 
vailed, yet as the Author 
testifieth, that in this Epistle he 
doth plainly untie the main knot. 
So I can and do testifie with him, 
that there is nothing desireable for 
the true attaining of the mysterie, 
both in the Theory and Practick 
[^p.20^] 
of it, which is not in this short Epistle 
fully taught. This then I intend 
as a key to all my former writings, 
and assure you on my faithful 
word, that I shall not speak one 
word doubtfully or mystically, as 
I have in all my other writings, 
seeming to aver some things which 
taken without a figure, are utterly 
false, which we did onely to conceal 
this Art: This key therefore 
we intend not to make common; 
and shall intreat you to keep it secret 
to your self, and not to communicate 
it, except it be to a sure 
friend, who you are confident will 
not make it publick. And this request 
we make upon very good 
grounds, knowing that all our 
writings together, are nothing to 
this, by reason of the contradictions 
w=ch= we have vvoven into them, 
which here is not done in the least 
measure. I shall therefore in this 
Epistle take up a new method, 
and that different from the former, 
and shall first draw up the substance 
of the Philosophy couched 
[^p.21^] 
in this Epistle, into several Conclusions, 
and after elucidate the 
same. 
 
The first Conclusion is drawn 
from the nineth stave of this Epistle, 
the eight first staves being only 
complemental, and that is, That 
as all things are multiplyed in their 
kind, so may be Mettals, which 
have in themselves a capacity of 
being transmuted the imperfect into 
perfect. 
 
The second Conclusion in the 
tenth stave is, That the main 
ground for the possibility of transmutation, 
is the possibility of reduction 
of all Mettals, and such 
Minerals as are of Mettalick principles, 
into their first Mercurialmater. 
 
The third Conclusion is in the 
eleventh stave, That among so 
many Mettaline or Mineral Sulphurs 
and so many Sulphurs there 
are but two that are related to 
our work, which Sulphurs have 
their Mercuries essentially united 
to them. 
 
The fourth conclusion from the 
[^p.22^] 
same stave is, That he who understands 
these two Sulphurs and Mercuries 
aright, shall find that the one 
is the most pure red Sulphur of 
gold, which is Sulphur in manifesto 
and Mercurius in occulto, and that 
other is most pure white Mercury, 
which is indeed true quicksilver, in 
manifesto and Sulphur in occulto, 
these are our two principles. 
 
The fifth Conclusion from the 
twelfth stave is, That if a mans principles 
be true, aud his operations 
regular, his event wil be certain, 
which event is not other than the 
true mystery. 
 
These Conclusions are but few 
in number, but of weight, 
the amplification, illustration, and 
ilucidation therfore of them will 
make a Son of Art truly glad. 
 
For the first, Forasmuch as it is 
not for our purpose here to invite any 
to the Art, onely intending to 
lead and guide the Sons of Art; we 
shall not prove the possibility of Alchimy, 
by many arguments, having 
done it abundantly in another Treatise. 
[^p.23^] 
He then that will be incredulous, 
let him be incredulous, he 
that will cavil, let him cavil; but 
he whose mind is perswaded of 
the truth of the Art, and of its 
dignity, let him attend to what 
is in the Illustration of these five 
Conclusions discovered, and his 
heart shall certainly rejoyce. 
 
We shall therefore briefly Illustrate 
this first Conclusion, and insist 
there more largely, where the 
secrets of the Art are most couched. 
 
For this first then which concludes 
in effect the truth of the Art, 
and its reality, he that would therein 
be more satisfied in it, let him 
read the Testimoniy of all Philosphers, 
and he that will not believe 
the Testimones of so many 
men, being most of them, men of 
renown in their own time, he wil 
cavill also against all other Arguments. 
 
We shall onely hold to Riplyes 
Testimony in this our key, who in 
the fourth stave, assures the King 
[^p.24^] 
that at Lovain he first saw the greatest 
and most perfect secrets, namely 
the two Elixers; And in his following 
verses, craves his confident 
credit, that he hath himself truly 
found the way of secret Alchimy, 
and promiseth the discovery of it 
to the King, onely upon condition 
of secrecy. 
 
And in the eighth stave, though 
he protests never to write it by 
pen, yet proffers the King at his 
pleasure, to shew him ocularly the 
red and white Elixer, and the working 
of them, which he promiseth 
will be done for easie costs in time. 
So then he that will doubt the truth 
of the Art, must account this famous 
Author, for a most simple 
mad Sophister, to write and offer 
such things to his Prince, unless he 
were able in effect to do what he 
promised, from which imputation 
his writings, and also the histories 
of him, of his fame, gravity, 
and worth will sufficiently cleer 
him. 
 
We now come to the second 
[^p.25^] 
Conclusion, the substance of 
which is, that all Mettals and bodies 
of Metaline principles, may be 
reduced to their first Mercurial matter, 
and this is the main and chief 
ground for the possibility of transmutation. 
On this we must insist 
largely & fully, for (trust me) this 
is the very hinge on which our 
secrets hang. 
 
First, then know that all Mettals, 
and several Minerals have [^Symbol of antimony omitted.^] 
for their next matter, to which 
(for the most part, nay indeed alwayes) 
there adheres, and is con-coagulated 
an external Sulphur, 
which is not Mettaline, but distinguishable 
from the internal kernel 
ofthe Mercury. 
 
This Sulphur is not wanting 
even in common Argent vive, by 
the Mediation of which, it may be 
precipitated into the form of a 
dry pouder. Yea and by a liquor 
well known to us, (though nothing 
helping the Art of transmutation) 
it may be so fixed, that it may endure 
all fires, the Test and Coppel, 
[^p.26^] 
and this without the addition 
of any thing to it, the liquor (by 
vertue whereof it is fixed) coming 
away intire, both in its Pondus and 
vertue. 
 
This Sulphur in gold and silver is 
pure, in the other Mettals less pure, 
therefore in gold and silver it is 
fixed, in other it is fugitive, in all 
the Mettals it is coagulated in 
Mercury or Argent vive, it is coagulable 
in gold, silver, and Mercury, 
this Sulphur, is so strongly united, 
that the Antients did ever 
judge Sulphur and Mercury to be 
all one, but we may by the help of a 
liquor, the invention of which, in 
these parts of the World we owe 
to Paracelsus (though among the 
Moores and Arabians it hath been 
and is (at this day) commonly 
known to the acuter sort of Chymists) 
by this I say we know that 
the Sulphur which is in Mercury 
coagulable, and in the Mettals 
coagulated, is external to the nature 
of Mercury, and may be separated 
in the form of a tincted 
[^p.27^] 
Mettalick Oyle, the remaining 
Mercury being then void of all 
Sulphur, save that which may be 
called its inward Sulphur, and is 
now inincoagulable of it self 
(though by our Elixer it is to be 
coagulated, but of it self, it can 
neither be fixt nor precipitated, 
nor sublimed, but remains unaltered 
in all corrosive waters, and 
in all digestions of heat. One way 
then of Mercury azating all Mettals 
and Minerals, is by the liquor 
Alcabest, which out of all such 
bodies as have Mercury in their 
constitution, can separate a running 
Argent vive, from which 
Argent vive all its sulphur is then 
separated, save that onely which is 
internal and central to the Mercury, 
which internal Sulphur of 
Mercury no corosive can touch, 
Next to this way of universal Reduction, 
there are also some other 
particular wayes, by which [^Symbol of lead omitted.^] 
[^Symbols of tin and antimony omitted.^], yea, even [^Symbol of copper^] and [^Symbol of iron omitted.^] may be 
reduced into a running quick-silver, 
by the help of Salts, which 
[^p.28^] 
because (being corporeal, they 
pierce not so radically as the fore 
named liquor doth, they therefore 
do not so spoile the Mercury of its 
Sulphur but that as much Sulphur 
as there is in common Mercury, 
so much also there is in this Mercury 
of the bodies, onely this Mercury 
hath specificated qualities 
according to the nature of the 
Mettal or Mineral, from which it 
was extracted, and from that reason 
(as to our work, which is to 
dissolve perfect species of Mettals) 
it hath no more vertue than common 
Argent vive: There is then 
but only one humidity, which is 
applicable unto our work, which 
certainly is neither of [^Symbol of lead omitted.^] nor [^Symbol of copper omitted.^], nor 
is drawn from any thing, which 
nature hath formed, but from a 
substance compounded by the Art 
of the Philosopher. So then, if a 
Mercury drawn from the bodies, 
have not onely the same deficiency 
of heat and superfluity of foeces 
as common Mercury hath, but also 
a distinct specificated form, it 
[^p.29^] 
must (by reason of this its form) 
be so much the farther remote from 
our Mercury then common Argent 
vive is. 
 
Our Art therefore is to compound 
two principles (one in 
which the salt, and another in 
which the Mercury of nature doth 
abound) which are not yet perfect, 
nor yet totally imperfect and by 
consequence) may therefore (by 
our Art be exalted with that 
(which is totally perfect, cannot 
be) and then by common Mercury 
to extract not the Pondus, but the 
celestial vertue out of the compound, 
which vertue (being fermental) 
begets in the common 
Mercury an off-spring more noble 
than it self, which is our true Hermaphrodite, 
which will congeal 
it self, and dissolve the bodies; 
observe but a grain of Corn 
in which scarce a discernable part 
is sprout, and this sprout, if it were 
out of the grain, would dye in a 
moment; the whole grain is sowen, 
yet the sprout onely produceth 
[^p.30^] 
the herb: So is it in our body, 
the fermental spirit that is in 
it, is scarce a third part of the 
whole, the rest is of no value, yet 
all is joyned in the composition, 
and the fæculent corporeous, part of 
the body comes away with the 
dreggs of the Mercury. But beyond 
the example given of a grain, 
it may be observed that the hidden 
and spiritual vertue of this our body, 
doth purge and purifie its matrix of 
water, in which it is sowen, that is, 
it makes it cast forth a great quantity 
of filthy earth, and a great deal of 
Hydropical saline moisture. For instance 
make thy washings (for a tryall) 
with pure and clean fountain-water, 
weigh first a pint of the same 
water, and take the exact weight of 
it, then wash thy compound eight or 
ten times, save all the fæces, weigh 
thy body and Mercury exactly, 
weigh thy fæces being very dry, 
then distill or sublime all that will 
sublime a very little quick Mercury 
will ascend; then put the Residue 
of the fæces in a crucible, set them 
[^p.31^] 
on the coals, and all the fæculency 
of the Mercury will burn like a 
coal, yet without fume; when that 
is all consumed, weigh the remaining 
fæces, and thou shalt find them to be 
two thirds of thy body, the others 
being in the Mercury, weigh the 
Mercury which thou sublimedst, and 
the Mercury prepared by it self, and 
the weight of both will not recompence 
thy Mercury weight by 
farre. So then boile up thy water 
to a skin, in which thou madest 
thy Lotions, for that is a thick water: 
and in a cool place thou shalt 
have Christals, which is the salt of 
Mercury Crude, and no way fit for 
Medicines; yet it is a content for 
the Artists to see how the Heterogeneyties 
of Mercury are discovered, 
which no other Art save the liquor 
of Alcahest can do, and that in a 
destructive, and not a generative 
way as this is, for this operation of 
ours is made between male and female, 
within their own kind, between 
which there is a ferment 
which effecteth that which no other 
[^p.32^] 
thing in the world could do. In 
all truth, I tell you, that if you 
should take our imperfect compound 
body, per se, and Mercury 
per se, and them alone, though you 
might bring out of the one a most 
pure Sulphur, and out of the other 
Mercury of Mercury, which is the 
nut of Mercury, yet with these thou 
couldst effect nothing, for fermental 
virtue is the wonder of the 
World, and it is by it, that water 
becomes Herbs, Trees, and Plants, 
Fruits, Flesh, Blood, Stones, Minerals 
and every thing, look then for 
it onely, and rejoyce in it as in a deservedly 
invaluable treasure; Now 
know that fermentation, work not 
out of kind, neither do salts ferment 
Mettals; Wilt thou know then 
whence it is that some fixt Alcalyes 
do extract a Mercury out of Minerals, 
and out of the more imperfect 
Metals, consider then, that in all 
these bodies the Sulphur is not so radically 
mixt and united, as it is in 
Silver and Gold. Now Sulphur is 
of Kin to divers Alcalyes, that are 
[^p.33^] 
ordinarily dissolved or melted with 
it, and by this means the Mercurial 
parts are disjoyned, and the Argent 
vive is by fire separated. The 
Mercury thus separated, is spoyled 
of its Sulphur when as indeed there 
needs onely a depuration of the 
Sulphur by separating the impure 
from the pure; but these salts having 
separated the Sulphur do leave the 
Mercury worse, that is, more estranged 
from a Metallick nature, 
than it was before, for in its composition 
that Sulphur of Saturn will 
not burn, but though it be sublimed, 
calcined, made sugar, or vitrefied, 
yet by fire and fluxes it still returns 
to the same it was in before, 
but its Sulphur being (as is aforesaid) 
seperated, will take fire, if joyned 
with Salt-peter, even as common 
Sulphur doth, So that the Salts act 
on the Sulphur of which they rob 
the Mercury, they act not for want 
of ferment which is not to be found, 
but onely among Homogeneall 
things. Therefore the ferment of 
bread leavens not a stone, nor doth 
[^p.34^] 
the ferment of any animal or vigetable, 
ferment a mettal or mineral. 
 
So then, though out of Gold thou 
mightest obtaine a Mercury by the 
help of the Liquor, of the first 
ens of Salt, yet that Mercury 
would never accomplish our 
work, whereason the otherside 
made out of Gold by our Mercury, 
though there be three parts of our 
Mercury to one of Gold, This Mercury 
I say will by continual digestion) 
accomplish the whole work, 
marvell not then, that our Mercury 
is more powerfull, which is prepared 
by Mercury, for certainly the 
ferment, which commeth between 
the compound Body and the 
Water, causeth a death, and a regeneration, 
it doth that, which nothing 
in the world can do, besides 
it severs from Mercury a terrestreity, 
which burns like a Coale, and 
an Hydropical humor melting in 
common water, but the residue is 
acuated by a Spirit of life, which is 
our true embryonated Sulphur of 
[^p.35^] 
our water, not visible, yet working 
visibly; We conclude that all 
operations for our Mercury but by 
common Mercury, and our body 
according to our Art are erronious, 
and will never produce our mystery, 
although they be other wise never so 
wonderfull. For as the Author of 
the Newlight saith, No water in 
any Island of the Phylosophers, was 
wholesom, but that which was 
drawn out of the reines of the Soll 
and Luna. Wilt thou know what 
that meanes? Mercury in its pondus 
and incombustibility is Gold fugitive, 
our Body in its purity, is called 
the Phylosophers Luna being farre 
more pure than the imperfect mettals 
and its Sulphur also as pure 
as the Sulphur of Soll, not that 
it is indeed Luna, for it abides not 
in the fire, now in the composition 
of these three (1) our common 
Mercury and the two principles of 
our compound there interceeds, 
the ferment of Luna, out of which 
though it be a Body, proceeds yet 
a specificating odor: yea and oft 
[^p.36^] 
the pondus of it is diminished: If 
the compound be much washt, after 
it is sufficiently clean. So then 
the ferment of Soll and Luna interceeds 
in our composition, which 
ferment begets an offspring, more 
noble than it self a 1000fold, whe-as 
should'st thou work on our compound 
Body by a violent way of 
Salts, thou should'st have thy Mercury 
by farre less noble, than the 
Body, the Sulphur of the Body 
being separated and not exalted by 
such a progress. 
 
We now come to the third conclusion, 
which is that among all metalline 
and mineral Sulphur there 
are onely two, that belong to our 
work, which two have their Mercuries 
essentially united with them. 
This is the truth of our secrets, 
though we (to seduce the unwary) 
do seem to aver the contrary, for 
do not think that (because we do 
insinuate two waies, therefore) 
we really mean as we say, for verily 
(as witnesseth Ripley) There is 
[^p.37^] 
no true principles but one, Nor 
have we but one matter, nor but 
one way of working upon that matter, 
nor but one regimen of heat, 
and one linear way of proceeding. 
 
These two Sulphurs as they 
are principles of our work, they 
ought to be homogeneal, for it is 
onely Gold spiritual that we seek, 
first white, then red, which Gold is 
no other then that which the vulgar 
see, but they know not the hidden 
spirit that is in it. This principle 
wants nothing but Composition, 
and this composition must be made, 
with our other crude white Sulphur 
which is nothing but Mercury 
vulgar, by frequent cohobation of 
it upon our Hermaphroditical Body, 
so long till it be come a fiery 
water. 
 
Know therefore that Mercury 
hath in its self a Sulphur, which being 
unactive, our Art is to multiply 
in it a living active Sulphur, which 
comes out of the loyns of our Hermaphroditical 
Body, whose father, 
[^p.38^] 
is a metal and his mother a mineral, 
Take then the most beloved daughter 
of Saturn, whose armes are a 
circle Argent, and on it a sable cross 
on a blackfield, which is the signall 
note of the great World, espouse 
her to the most warlike God, who 
dwels in the house of Aries, and thou 
shalt find the Salt of Nature, with 
this Salt acuate thy water, as thou 
best knowest, and thou shalt have 
the Lunary bath, in which the Sun 
will be amended. 
 
And in all truth I assure thee, that 
although thou hadst our body Mercurialized 
(without the addition of 
Mercury of any of the metals) made 
per se, that is without the addition 
of Mercury, it would not be in the 
least profitable unto thee, for it is 
our Mercury onely, which hath a 
Celestial form and power, which it 
receives, not onely, nor so much 
from the compound body, as from 
the fermental virtue, which proceeds 
from the composition of both the 
body and the Mercury, by which is 
[^p.39^] 
produced a wonderfull Creature: 
So then let all thy care be to marry 
Sulphur with Sulphur, that is our 
Mercury which is imprægnated, 
which Sulphur, must be espoused 
with our [^Symbol of the sun omitted.^] then hast thou two Sulplers 
married and two Mercuries of 
one off spring, whose father is the 
[^Symbol of the sun omitted.^] and [^Symbol of the moon omitted.^] the mother. 
 
The fourth Conclusion makes all 
perfectly plain, which hath been said 
before, namely that these two Sulphurs 
are the one most pure red Sulphur 
of Gold, and the other of most 
pure clean white Mercury. 
 
These are our two Sulphurs, the 
one appears a coagulated body, and 
yet carries its Mercury in its belly: 
the other is in all its proportions true 
Mercury, yet very clean and carries 
its Sulphur within its self, though 
hidden under the form and fluxibilitie 
of Mercury. 
 
Sophisters are (here) in a labyrinth, 
for because they are not acquainted 
[^p.40^] 
with metalline love, they work in 
things altogether heterogeneal, or 
if they work upon metalline bodies, 
they yet either joyne males with 
males, or else females with females, 
or else they work on each alone, or 
else they take males, which are charged 
with natural inabilities, and females 
whose matrix is vitiated: Thus 
by there own inconsideration they 
frustrate their own hopes; and then 
cast the blame upon the Art, when 
as indeed it is onely to be imputed 
to their own folly, in not understanding 
the Phylosophers. 
 
I know many pittifull Sophisters 
do dote on many Stones, vigitable, 
animal, and mineral, and some to 
those add the fiery Angelical, Paradaical 
Stone, which they call a 
Wonder working essence, and because 
the mark they aim at, is so 
great, the Waies also, by which 
they would attain their Scope, they 
make also a double, one Way they 
call the Via Humida, the other, the 
Via Sicca, (to use their languages), 
 
[^p.41^] 
The latter Way is the labirinthian 
path, which is fit onely for the 
great ones of the earth to tread in, 
the other the dedalean path, an easie 
way of small cost for the poor of the 
world, to enterprize. 
 
But this I know and can testifie 
that there is but one Way, and but 
onely one Regimen, no more Colours 
than ours, and what we say 
or write otherwise, is but to deceive 
the unwary, for if every thing in 
the world ought to have its proper 
causes, there cannot be any one end, 
which is produced from two waies 
of working on distinct principles. 
Therefore we protest and must again 
admonish the Reader that (in 
our former writings) we have concealed 
much, by reason of the two 
waies we have insinuated, which is 
the play of children, and the work of 
women, and that is decoction by 
the fire, and we protest that the 
lowest degree of this our work, is 
that the matter be stirred up, and 
may hourly circulate without feare 
[^p.42^] 
of breaking of the vessel, which for 
this reason ought to be very strong, 
but our linear decoction is an internal 
work, which advances every 
day and hour, and is distinct from 
that of outward heat, and therefore 
is both invisible and insensible. In 
this our work, our Diana is our body 
when it is mixed with the water, 
for then all is called the Moon, for 
Laton in whitened, and the Woman 
beares rule, our Diana hath a wood, 
for in the first dayes of the Stone, 
our body after it is whitened grows 
vegitably. In this wood, are at the 
last found two Doves, for about the 
end of three weeks, the soul of the 
Mercury ascends, with the soul of 
the disolved Gold, these are in folded 
in the everlasting armes of Venus, 
for in this season the confection 
are all tincted with a pure green 
colour, these Doves are circulated 
seven times, for in seven is perfection, 
and then they are left dead, 
for they then rise and move no 
more, our Body is then black like 
to a Crowes bill, for in this operation 
[^p.43^] 
all is turned to pouder, blacker 
than the blackest. Such passages as 
these we do oftentimes use, when 
we speak of the preparation of our 
Mercury, and this we do to deceive 
the simple, and it is also for no other 
end that we confound our operations 
speaking of one, when we 
ought to speak of another, for if 
this Art were but plainly set down, 
our operations would be contemptible 
even to the foolish. 
Therefore believe me in this, that 
because our workes are truly Natural, 
we therefore do take the liberty 
to confound the Phylosophers 
work, with that which is purely 
Natures work, that so we might 
keep the simple in ignorance, concerning 
our true Vinegre, which 
being unknown, their labor is 
wholly lost. 
 
Let me then (for a close) say onely 
thus much; Take our Body which 
is Gold, and our Mercury which is 
seven times acuated by the marriage 
of it, with our Hermaphroditicall 
[^p.44^] 
Body, which is a Chaos, and it 
is the splendor of the soul of the 
God Mars, in the earth, and water of 
Saturn, mix these two in such a pondus 
as nature doth require, In this 
mixture you have our invisible fires, 
for in the water our Mercury is an 
active Sulphur or mineral fire, 
and in the Gold a dead passive, but 
yet actual Sulphur now when 
that Sulphur of the Gold is stirred 
up and quickned, there is made 
between the fire of nature which is 
as the Gold, and the fire against nature, 
which is in the Mercury, a fire 
partly of the one and partly of the other, 
for it partakes of both, and by 
these two fires thus united into one, 
is caused both Corruption (which 
is Humiliation) and Generation 
(which is Glorification and Perfection:) 
Now know that God 
onely governs this way of the internal 
fire, man being ignorant of 
the progress thereof, onely by 
his reason beholding its operations, 
he is able to discern that 
it is hot, that is, that it doth perform 
[^p.45^] 
the action of heat, which is 
decoction, In this fire there is no 
sublimation, for sublimation is an 
exaltation, but this fire is such an 
exaltation, as that beyond it, is no 
perfection. 
 
All our work then is onely to 
multiply this fire, that is to circulate 
the body so long until the vertue 
of the Sulphur be augmented. 
Again this fire is an invisible 
Spirit, and therefore not having dimentions, 
is neither above nor below, 
but every where in the Sphere 
of the activity of our matter in the 
Vessel; So that though the material 
visible substance do sublime and 
ascend by the action of the elemental 
heat, yet this spiritual virtue is alway 
as well in that which remains in the 
bottom, as in that which is in the 
upper part of the Vessel. for it is 
as the soul in the body of man, which 
is every where at the same time, and 
yet bounded or termined in none. 
 
This is the ground of one Sophism 
[^p.46^] 
of ours, (viz.) when we say that 
in this true Philosphical fire, there 
is no sublimation, for the fire is the 
life, and the life is a soul, which is 
not at all subject to the dimensions 
of Bodies, Hence also it is that the 
opening of the Glass or cooling of 
the same during the time of working 
kils the life or fire, that is in this secret 
Sulphur, and yet not one grain 
of the mettal is lost. The elemental 
fire then is that which any child 
knowes how to kindle and govern, 
but it is the Philosopher onely, that 
is able to discern the true inward fire 
for it is a wonderful thing, which 
acts in the body, yet is no part of the 
body. Therefore the fire is a Celestial 
virtue it is uniformed, that is, 
it is alwaies the same untill the period 
of its operation is come, and then 
being come to perfection it acts no 
more, for every Agent, when the 
end of its action is come then rests. 
 
Remember then that when we 
speak of our fire which sublimes not, 
that thou do not mistake and think 
[^p.47^] 
that the moisture of the compound 
which is within the Glass ought not 
to sublime, for that it must do uncesantly, 
but the fire that sublimes 
not, is the metalline love, which is 
above aud below and in all places alike. 
Now then for a close to all 
that hath been said, learn and be well 
advised what matter you take in 
hand, for and evil Crow laies an evil 
Egg, as the proverb hath it, let thy 
seed be pure, and thy matrix also 
pure, then shalt thou see a noble off-spring, 
let the fire without be such, 
as in which our confections may play 
to & fro uncessantly, & this (in a few 
daies) will produce that which thou 
most longest for, the Crows Bill.
