[}Of the Four Quarters of the Year, and first of the Spring.}] 
 
THE Spring Quarter begins, when the Sun entring the first 
point of Aries, maketh equal day and night, which this 
Year happens upon the 9th day of March, at 1 hour, 14 min. 
57 sec. Afternoon, in the Meridian of London; according to 
Astronomia Anglicana. Now as days and nights are of equal length, 
so is there an equality in the temper of the Air; whereby the 
Pores of the Earth are relaxed, and a vivifying fume evaporating, 
ascendeth by the cold and chillified Roots of Herbs and 
Plants, and produceth their vegetable Life. This Quarter generally 
is hot and moist, if it prove otherwise, it bringeth diseases, 
and dangerous distempers. Such persons as are naturally 
Melancholly do enjoy their Healths the best this Quarter; the 
Sanguine the contrary; Such diseases as proceed from excess 
and putrefaction of blood are most dangerous, but such as have 
their Original from Melancholly are less hurtful. In March be 
not too busie in purging or bleeding, but rather bathe and use 
such meats or medicines as purge and sweeten the blood. In 
April you may freely bleed, bathe, or purge if there be occasion, 
but now drink moderately, and forbear salt meats. In May 
you may purge gently the blood or body, or open a vein; to 
drink clarified Whey is good, but forbear Wine, and such meats 
as are of a hot quality. 
 
[}Of Summer.}] 
 
SUmmer Quarter begins the 10th. day of June, at 3 hours, 
57 minutes, 32 seconds. Afternoon, the Sun appearing at 
the Tropick of Cancer, maketh the longest day and shortest 
night to all on this side the Equator. This Quarter naturally is 
hot and dry; Persons of Phlegmatick constitutions are now best 
in health, the cholerick the contrary, antient people do now 
revive, but young people languish through excess of blood, and 
are thereby exposed to Feavers, especially the Tertian: In the 
month of June abstain from such meats as ingender [^ORIG. BLURRED^] and 
moist humours. It is now excellent good to rise early, and to 
exercise the body with moderate walking. In July beware of 
bleeding or purging, unless there be great necessity; beware 
also of eating such meats as ingender melancholly, and of taking 
cold: in this and the next month refrain immoderate exercise 
[^f.A4r^] 
and venery, and drink not much Wine, for now it dries 
the Stomach and Liver, and doth too much increase Choler. 
 
[}Of Autumn.}] 
 
WHich this year begins the 12th. day of September, 2 
min. 25 seconds after 7 of the Clock in the morning, 
the Earth then entring Aries, or the Sun Libra, again making 
equal day and night. This Quarter naturally is cold and dry, resembling 
melancholy; youth is now lively; persons of moist 
and phlegmatick constitutions are now best in health, the melancholy 
the contrary. In September eat moderately of all such 
meats and fruits as your stomack desires, for they are now in 
their vigour and perfection; in this month or the next you 
may bleed or purge, if there be occasion, but in November melancholly 
increaseth, and blood decreaseth; bathing now is not 
good; salt, or powdered meats may now be eaten without any 
prejudice, roasted meats and wild Fowl are now held to be 
very wholsome; in this Quarter beware of taking cold. 
 
[}Of Winter.}] 
 
WInter Quarter begins the 10th. day of December, at 7 h. 
15 min. 48 seconds after Noon, the Sun appearing 
then at the entrance into Capricorn, maketh the shortest day, 
and longest night. This Quarter naturally is cold and moist; 
young and cholerick people are now best in health, but aged 
and phlegmatick are contrary. In December melancholy and 
phlegm do much increase, and it therefore behoves all persons 
that prize their healths, to keep themselves well from cold, and 
to eat such meats as be of a hot quality. 'Tis not now good to 
bleed or purge unless there be great occasion; to drink Wine 
now and then, and to use good Spices in your Diet is very good, 
the same observe in January. In February all meats of a moist 
nature are accounted hurtful, you may take pills to purge the 
Head, also bathe or take potions, and bleed now if there be 
occasion.
