[}The first part intreateth 
of dyuers and sundrie errours 
and abuses of the vnlearned and 
wycked sorte of Physitions.}] 
 
THAT excellente 
man & great clerk 
Aristoteles, who 
for his incomparable 
doctrine is 
of all learned men 
named the prince of philosophers 
hath this saying in the .vii. boke of 
his Ethikes: Non oportet tantum 
verum dicere, sed etiam causam falsi 
assignare, that is: A man may not 
onely tell the truth, but he must also 
shewe and declare the cause of 
falshod and errour. As who shold 
say: The truthe can neuer so well 
appere, as when it is compared to 
his contrary, which is errour, lye, 
and falshode. Quia opposita semper 
[^f.A1v^] 
iuxta se posita, magis elucescunt. 
Contrary thinges set one against 
an other, are always a great deale 
better knowen. 
 
The philosophers of ancient time 
as it appereth playnly in Aristotle 
and Galen, ye and in the holy doctours 
of the churche. In many of 
their works, had in a maner more 
adoo to confute the false errours, 
sophistrie & cauillations that were 
then vsed & imagined as true doctrin, 
the~ they had to write the very 
truth it selfe. The great mercy of 
God had neuer be~ so welknowen 
if the fal & transgression of ma~ had 
not ben. And as S. Paul saith in 
y=e= .v. chap. to y=e= Romans: Vbi exuberauit 
peccatu~, ibi magis exuberauit 
gratia, Where syn hath exceded 
there grace hath the more exceded. 
And Christ is S. Luke y=e= vii. cha. 
said of Mary Magdalen: Many 
[^f.A2r^] 
syns ar forgeue~ her, because she loued 
much. Nowe therfore, before 
I speake of y=e= abuses & enormities 
of phisike, I wil shew and declare 
first, what is the part office and co~dition 
of a good Phisition. Thus 
doyng I wyl first alledge Hippocratis 
lusiurandum, that is, the oth 
that Hipocrates wold y=t= euery phisition 
shuld take before he practise 
any phisike. I wil not recite y=e= hole 
chapter, but y=e= chiefest parte first in 
latin, then in english. Ceteru~ quod 
ad ægros attinet fanandos, dieta~ ipsis 
co~stitua~ pro facultate, & iuditio 
meo co~modam, omneq~ detrimentu~ 
et iniuria~ ab eis prohibebo. Neq~ vero 
vllius preces apud me adeo valide 
fuerint, vt cuipia~ venenu~ su~ propinaturus, 
neq~ etia~ ad hanc re~ co~siliu~ 
dabo. Similiter aute~ neq~ mulieri 
salum vulnæ subdititiu~ ad corrumpendum 
[^f.A2v^] 
co~ceptum vel fœtu~ dabo. 
Porro preterea, sancte vitam & artem 
mea~ conseruabo. Nec vero calculo 
laborantes secabo, sed viris chirurgie 
operarijs, eius rei faciende locu~ 
dabo. In quascunq~ aute~ domos 
ingrediar, ob vtilitatem egrotantiu~ 
intrabo, ab omniq~ iniuria volu~taria 
inferenda, & corruptione cu~ alia, tu~ 
presertim operum venereoru~ abstinebo, 
siue muliebria, siue virilia, liberorumue 
hominu~ aut seruorum corpora 
mihi co~tigerint cura~da. Quecu~q~ 
vero inter curandu~ videro aut 
audiuero, imo etia~ ad medicandum 
non adhibitus in co~muni hominum 
vita cognouero, ea siquidem efferre 
non contulerit, tacebo, & tanqua~ arcana 
apud me continebo. The englishe 
is this: And as concernyng 
the curyng of the sycke, I will ordeyn 
and deuise for them as good 
[^f.A3r^] 
a diete as shall lye in my power & 
iudgement. And I will take hede 
y=t= thei fal in no domage nor hurte. 
Nor yet any mans praiers shall so 
much preuail with me, that I geue 
poyson to any man, neither will I 
counsaile any man so to do. Likewise 
I will geue no maner of medicine 
to any woman with chylde 
to destroy her childe. Moreouer I 
will vse my life and science godly. 
I will not cut those that haue the 
stone, but I will co~mit that thyng 
onely to the Surgions. In what 
house so euer I shall come in, my 
co~myng shalbe for the pacients co~moditie 
and profite. And I wil refraine 
willingly from doyng any 
hurt or wronge, & from falshode, & 
chiefly fro~ venereous actes, what 
kynd of bodies soeuer it shal cha~ce 
me to haue in cure: whether it be 
[^f.A3v^] 
of me~ or wome~, of fre or bond seruants. 
And whatsoeuer I shal see 
or heare among my cures (yea although 
I be not sought nor called 
to any) whatsoeuer I shall know 
amo~g the people, if it be not lauful 
to be vttered, I shal kepe close, and 
kepe it as a secrete vnto my selfe: 
Again, the same Hippocrates saith 
in the boke or chapter called Lex. 
(To eschue tediousnes I wil leue 
the latin) who soeuer saith, he wyl 
truly get him the knowlege of phisike, 
he must satisfie his mynd, and 
as it were be accompanied with 
these guides, with nature, science, 
a place mete & co~uenient for study 
& lerning, an institution fro~ childhod, 
a labor & peinful dilige~ce with 
a long time. Ite~ in his boke de medico, 
he saieth: The phisition must 
be of a good coloure, and comely 
countenaunce, and of a good disposition 
[^f.A4r^] 
of the body: he muste also 
be had in estimation among the 
common people, by comely apparell, 
and by swete sauours (so that 
he be not suspected of to much excesse) 
for by suche meanes the pacientes 
are wont to be delited. 
 
In lyke maner the Physition 
muste see and studye, that he bee 
of a modest and sobre mynde, and 
not onely as concernynge modest 
talke, but also in other things concerning 
his behauiour, he must be 
wel disposed: for there is nothyng 
y=t= getteth a man better estimation 
and authoritie then to bee endued 
with an honest lyfe and good maners. 
Hys countenaunce must be 
lyke one that is geuen to studye 
and sadde, and yet not ouer much, 
for so he should be taken to be stubborn 
& scornful, & like one y=t= disdaineth 
[^f.A4v^] 
other mens company: but on 
the contrary, he that hath always 
a laughing contenance, & is geuen 
to too much iesture and mirthe: is 
taken for a lewde person. And ther 
fore this must nedes be eschewed. 
Also he must be iust and beare him 
selfe vpright in all his busynes and 
affayres. &c. 
 
In his booke De decenti ornatu 
he saith: a Phisicion beinge a Philosopher 
is equall in a maner vnto 
god. Item it is decent that the phisicion 
be gentyll and curteis, for 
rudenesse and churlishnes are gretly 
misliked, as wel of the whole as 
of the sicke. He must often visit his 
pacie~t and be diligent. He may not 
declare all thinges to his pacient, 
but some things he must kepe close 
from him, and must conforte him 
with a liuely & mery countenance. 
[^f.A5r^] 
And sometimes to withdraw him 
from his fonde desiers, he muste 
rebuke him, in resisting with sharp 
words: and somtimes againe he 
must intreate & conforte him, with 
a dexteritie and gentle perswasion. 
And yet notwithstanding he may 
not alwaies tell him of his present 
state, nor what shall becom of him. 
 
Thus much I haue brought out 
of Hipocrates to testifye & declare 
the office and condition of a Phisicion. 
Now som thing will I bring 
out of Galen, who in his boke intituled 
quod optimus medicus idem 
est et Philosophus, declareth plainly 
by the very title of y=e= boke it self, 
what learning a Phisicion ought 
to haue. He saith also in his boke de 
Antidotis, That a Phisicion if it be 
possible oughte to haue the knowledge 
of al herbes, if not, at the least 
[^f.A5v^] 
he ought to knowe those whiche 
be commonly vsed. Agayne in the 
commentaries vpon the fyrst boke 
of Hippocrates de morbis vulgaribus: 
The Phisicion saith he ought 
in any wise to haue a respect to profit 
and helpe his pacientes, and if 
he can not, then at the leaste wise 
that he hurt them not. 
 
Item vpon the vi. boke de morbis 
vulgaribus he saith: Albeit that 
the phisicion be gentle and curteis, 
sober & also mery, yet neuertheles 
he ought not to minishe his grauitie, 
for vnlesse the paciente haue in 
reuerence & estimation his phisici~ 
as a god, he shall neuer folow and 
obey his consell, it wil be therfore 
very decent that y=e= phisicion do not 
so abase hym selfe & flatter, that he 
bringe him selfe in a contempte: 
Nor agayne, as it were an other 
[^f.A6r^] 
Callianactes, shewe him selfe hoggish 
and rude. And that shal he easely 
bring to passe, if in his countenaunce 
and talke and al his honest 
behauior, he retayne the grauitie of 
a phisicion, and so do perswade his 
pacient to followe and kepe those 
things that he appoynteth and ordayneth 
for him. 
 
But now lest I should be to tediouse 
in alledging many authors: 
I will come to those of our tyme, 
and namely I wil bring that man 
of high learning & famous memorie 
master doctor Siluius, who somtimes 
was y=e= publike reader of phisicke 
in the vniuersitie of Paris, hauing 
daily at his Lecture litle lack 
of a M. auditors (or as they call 
the~, scholars) of the which I being 
one, may plainly testify it to be tru 
The same Siluius saith in his boke 
[^f.A6v^] 
De ordine legendi libros Galeni et 
Hippocratis, that a good Phisicion 
must haue al these properties. 
 
Fyrst, he must be naturally bent 
and geuen to onely trueth, all the 
dayes of his life, he must be circumspect, 
discrete, and of a good pregnant 
witte and memorie. 
 
Secondly, he must haue a sounde 
and, healthye bodie, & must be able 
to abide great payne in studying. 
 
Thirdly, he must be endued with 
great richesse, or at leaste he muste 
haue sufficient to liue by. 
 
Fourthly, he must haue and get 
his learning of the best learned me~ 
of his time, who diligentlye, euen 
from his childhode must instructe 
him with these sciences: grammer, 
Logick, musicke, Astronomie, and 
chiefely (as Plato counsayleth) Arithmetick 
and geometrie, and also 
[^f.A7r^] 
Philosophie. 
 
Nowe to come to my chiefe Intent 
& purpose, & (as they are wont 
to say) to the principal: These thinges 
aboue rehearsed, well wayed 
& considered: what hope may there 
be conceaued? what foundation & 
stay may be had? yea what securitie 
& sauegard is there in these sort 
of fellowes: which now a days almost 
in al places so rashly, so fondly 
and so wickedly do abuse the noble 
art & science of Phisicke. Where 
is their great and manifold knowlege 
of the tounges, of the liberall 
sciences, of Philosophie, of anatomie, 
of the simples, of the compou~d 
medicines, and of the temperatures 
or co~plexions? wher haue they studied? 
of who~ haue thei learned their 
science? (if I may call it a science) 
what authors haue they sene or red. 
[^f.A7v^] 
Many of them wil answere & say 
vnto me thus: Syr although we 
haue not this exquisite knowledge 
that you require in vs, yet we haue 
had experience of manye thinges, 
we haue Englishe bokes enough 
to teach vs diuers medicins for diuerse 
purposes, yea and some of vs 
haue a gifte of nature to heale many 
diseases. 
 
I aunswere that youre reasoninge 
is fayre, but it is grounded 
vppon a very slender and feable 
foundation. For first as touchinge 
your experie~ce, how can it be good 
vnles it be ioyned to knowledge & 
science? what though you haue geuen 
a medecine, as for example, a 
purgacion to purge fleame to any 
man in the winter, supposing that 
man to be somewhat aged, of a 
flegmaticke complexion, vsynge 
[^f.A8r^] 
muche flegmaticke meates, muche 
slepe and muche reste: and that the 
sayde purgation hath taken good 
effecte and wrought well, all this 
supposed: Let the lyke medecine be 
geuen in the sommer to a man of 
an other complexion, of an other 
diete and of an other age: yea supposyng 
this, that it be geuen to the 
selfe same man in the Sommer: 
Shall the same purgation (thinke 
you) take suche effecte and operation, 
as it dyd afore in the winter? 
no verely: or els Hippocrates 
that aunciente father and founder 
of all Phisicke (whose sayinges 
and writinges wee followe and 
credite, tanq~~ Apollinis oracula) 
shoulde haue fowly erred, and speciallye 
in hys Booke De natura 
humana, 
 
[^f.A8v^] 
Galen in his thirde boke de methodo 
medendi saith, that there be 
two instrumentes of all maner of 
inuention, that is to wete, Reason 
and experience. He that knoweth 
a thyng that is inuented and fou~d 
by experience, and yet can not tell 
the reason of it why it is so: plainly 
declareth to know it only by experience. 
But that he may vndersta~d 
how muche he erreth, let him geue 
eare vnto me awhiles, for I mind 
to talke a fewe wordes with hym 
which foloweth onley experience. 
Thus much Galen: What he saith 
after, I leue it, lest I be to tedious. 
 
The same Galen also vpon the 
first Aphorisme of the fyrste boke 
of Hipocrates. The experie~ce saith 
he) of phisik is dangerous, (which 
be also Hippocrates words) for the 
materiall subiecte of phisicke is no 
[^f.B1r^] 
tilestones, or common stones, dyrt, 
woode or leather, as they are of other 
craftes and sciences, in the 
which you may make or marre any 
thinge without danger. For if 
you spill a piece of wood or leather 
in mishandelyng it, there is no danger, 
but onely a lytle losse or dommage, 
whiche is sone recouered agayne 
by diligence. But to proue 
thinges in mans bodie whiche be 
not afore approued by lernyng and 
experience, is not without danger 
of deathe. 
 
Nowe as concerninge your seconde 
reason, by the which you affirme 
to haue many english bokes 
that teacheth you phisike: I answer 
that the englishe bookes teacheth 
nothinge of the trewe foundation 
of Phisike. For if there be any that 
doo it, howe can it be well vnderstanded 
[^f.B1v^] 
without logike and naturall 
philosophie. For Aristotle saith 
Vbi desinit Physicus, ibi incipit me 
dicus, A man must first peruse naturall 
Philosophie, before he entre 
into phisycke. 
 
I doo not denye but to haue 
some bokes of phisike in englyshe 
specially of the Simples, well and 
cunnyngly set foorthe for Surgeons, 
Apothecaries, yea and for sober 
and wyse men, that delyte to 
reade in suche thynges, and know 
not the Latine tongue, is not vnmete 
nor hurtefull. Althoughe I 
woulde not wyshe, nor it is not 
decente, that eyther Surgion or 
Apothecarie, or any other manne, 
beyng no physition should practise 
or vse any inward medicine without 
the learned and approued physitions 
counsayle. For as the two 
[^f.B2r^] 
Prouerbes sayeth: Falcem ne mittas 
in messem alienam, Et ne sutor 
vltra crepidam, Let no man medle 
with an other mannes corne, but 
with his owne. Lette the shoemaker 
meddle with his shoes. 
 
But to the pourpose, doo you 
thynke to haue in youre Englyshe 
Bookes, all the perfecte knoweledge 
that is required in Physicke? 
Yea, haue you the tenthe parte 
onely? We coulde neuer haue it 
yet in Greke and Latine perfectly 
(not wythstandynge we haue it 
nowe better then euer we hadde 
afore) howe thenne shoulde you 
haue it? If Englyshe Bookes 
could make men cunnyng Physitions, 
then pouchemakers, threshers 
ploughme~ & coblers mought 
be Physitions as well as the best, 
[^f.B2v^] 
yf they can reade. 
 
Then wer it a great foly for vs 
to bestow so much labor and study 
all our lyfe tyme in the scholes 
and vniuersities, to breake oure 
braynes in readynge so many authours, 
to be at the lectures of so 
many learned menne, yea and the 
greatest follye of all were, to procede 
in any degree in the Uniuersities 
with our great coste & charges, 
when a syr Iohn lacke latin 
a pedler, a weauer, and oftentymes 
a presumptuous woma~, shall 
take vppon them (yea and are permytted) 
to mynyster Medicine to 
all menne, in euery place, and at 
all tymes. O tempora, O mores, 
O Deum immortalem, To what 
purpose haue the vniuersities ben 
erected & founded in tymes paste? 
To what purpose haue they so 
[^f.B3r^] 
many goodly priuileges graunted 
vnto them of al princes successiuely 
from all ages? what doth it preuaile 
for vs that be lerned to procede 
(as I saide) in any degree of 
maister, of bacheler, or doctor, and 
so to be allowed and haue authoritie 
to vse our scie~ce? when euery 
man, woman, and chyld that lyst, 
may practise and vse phisike (idq~ 
impune) as well as we? and so, many 
tymes not only hinder and defraud 
vs of our laufull stipende & 
gaynes: but (which is worst of all 
and to much to be lamented) shall 
put many in hasarde of their lyfe, 
yea & be the destruction of many. 
Is this tolerable? will the magistrates 
alwayes wynke at this? 
shall there neuer be no reformation 
for suche abuses? God of his 
great mercy grau~t that ones they 
[^f.B3v^] 
may be refourmed. For if they be 
not, verily it wyll greately discourage 
men of learnyng hereafter to 
apply them selues to the studye of 
Physyke, whereby the healpe, succour 
and sauegard of many a sick 
man, woman, and chylde shall be 
hyndred and secluded: yea and many 
shall fall in danger, and be sicke 
which otherwyse mought be preserued 
from al sicknes by the right 
ministerie of physike. For physyke 
is appoynted not onely to expelle 
sicknes, but also to preserue the body 
in healthe. 
 
But nowe to the thirde parte I 
aunswere: you say that you heale 
many tymes by the gyfte of Nature: 
I praye you telle me what 
you meane by nature. Perhappes 
you vnderstande by Nature, a naturall 
inclynation or dysposition, 
[^f.B4r^] 
geuen by the influence of starres 
and planettes, (as I doo not denye 
but that we may be the better 
moued and inclined to any arte by 
theyr influence) yet is it not a mere 
gyfte, but onely a disposition, and 
as it were a dexteritie and naturall 
towardnesse to heale som kind 
of disease: whych thyng notwithsta~dyng 
is oftentymes done more 
by chaunce, then by any certayne 
Methode or Reason. For verilye 
haue you neuer so good a wytte, 
disposition and inclination to any 
arte: yet if you applye not that arte 
and exercise your self in it earnestly, 
and continually, and specially in 
this science of physike (whiche can 
neuer be well vsed without greate 
study, & the knowledge of diuers 
other sciences, as I haue saide afore) 
your doyngs shalbe but rashe 
[^f.B4v^] 
vayne, and of small effecte. For as 
the philosopher saith: Scientiæ nobis, 
non innascu~tur, sed acquiru~tur, 
The sciences ar not infused in vs 
at our byrth, but are gotten afterward: 
And science is thus defined 
in Logicke: Science is an habite, 
(that is) a ready, prompt and bent 
disposition to do any thynge, confirmed 
and gotten by long study, 
exercise and vse. Therfore the naturall 
inclination by the influence 
of the starres can profite but little, 
vnlesse you applye your selfe with 
greate diligence and study to that 
kynd of science or art that you intende 
to practise and folowe. 
 
But yf you vnderstande (by Nature) 
God: I say plainly, that god 
doth not geue the gyfte of healing 
to any wicked people, but only by 
a speciall priuiledge to those onely 
[^f.B5r^] 
that be of a moste pure, sobre, and 
holy lyfe, as we reade of the apostles, 
and some of the Prophetes. 
And as sainct Paule saythe in the 
first epistle, the .xii. chap. to the Corinth. 
To some is geuen the gyfte 
of healyng by the holy ghost. So 
that to hele by this maner of meanes, 
is not commonly to vse herbes, 
rootes, or any other drouges 
bought at the poticaries shop, or to 
take any money or other rewarde 
for the healynge. For this kynde 
of healyng is the mere gift of god 
workynge in those (to whome it 
pleaseth God to geue it) withoute 
any laboure or studye. We heare 
of none nowe a dayes that hathe 
thys gyfte of nature (I meane of 
God) sauynge onely the kynges 
of Englande, and the Frenche 
kynges, whyche as the Excellente 
[^f.B5v^] 
doctour Tagaultius saithe in the 
fyrst boke of his Chirurgie, haue a 
special gift to heale the kings euil, 
called struma in latin. 
 
Therfore I conclude that howsoeuer 
you make youre argumente, 
your profession and practise in phisicke 
is nothing worthe, but rather 
is false, deceytefull, vniuste, vnlawfull, 
and not any longer to be 
suffered. 
 
I coulde now if I were not to tedious 
to the readers, bring and allege 
out of the authors of phisicke, 
certayne notable examples of many 
rashe & dangerous cures, that 
hath bene done by many ignorant 
and lewde persons in times paste, 
if it were not that the dayly examples 
apeareth (alas) to much before 
our eyes in these our daies. 
 
I will saye nothinge nowe of 
[^f.B6r^] 
the Citie of Salisburie where I 
dwell, what abuses hath bene or be 
there, nowe concerning the arte of 
Phisicke. A reformation hath bene 
made there not very longe agone 
as touching suche matters, but yet 
all thinges are not so well brought 
to passe as I would wishe, and as 
I think good thei wer. I deliuered 
once certayne articles concerning 
the honest and lawfull vse of Phisicke, 
vnto the right reuerende father 
in God my lorde Bishoppe of 
Salisburie, which articles beyng 
(at the leaste in my Iudgemente) 
good and lawfull, if it wold please 
hys Lordeshyppe, yea and al other 
most honorable Bishoppes, eche of 
theym in his dioces, to admit and 
put in execution: I wolde suppose, 
imo I wolde beleue that Phisicke 
[^f.B6v^] 
should be better and more honestly 
truely and iustely vsed and ministred 
then it is nowe in these dais. 
 
And because that I would that 
euery man should see and knowe, 
what articles they be that I delyuered, 
I haue thought it good to 
take a copie of them (which notwithstanding 
I haue somwhat altered) 
and rehearse theym here in 
order. 
 
[}Seuen Articles concerning the ministration 
and vse of Phisike.}] 
 
[}The fyrst.}] 
 
It were very mete, expedient & 
necessary that no phisition shoulde 
practise phisicke in any dioces, vnles 
he were fyrste allowed by some 
vniuersitie: or at the leaste hauing 
sufficient learninge in the saide science, 
he were allowed and licensed 
by the byshop or his chaunceloure 
in that dioces wherin he dwelleth. 
 
[^f.B7r^] 
[}The second.}] 
 
It were good and necessarye that 
no Surgion shoulde practyse his 
surgery, vnles he coulde reade and 
write, and had knowledge and experience 
in the simples belonginge 
to his art. And that he presume not 
to let bloud or vndertake any hard 
cure, without the physitions counsell, 
if he may conueniently haue it. 
 
[}The thyrd}] 
 
That no Poticarie should minister 
of his owne heade, or ordeyne 
any purgation or other composition 
of Phisicke for any man: or that 
he shoulde prepare and make any 
purgation or notable confection, 
withoute the Phisitions aduyse 
and counsell, vnles that the Phisition 
hadde fyrst sene and vewed 
the Ingredientes, wherof the compositions 
are made, and speciallye 
the purgations. 
 
[^f.B7v^] 
[}The fourthe.}] 
 
It is not decent nor profitable for 
the common weale, that any ignorant 
lewde or ill suspected person, 
be he man or woman, shoulde be 
suffered to make, sell or minister 
medecines to any bodie, but that 
suche kind of persons (beyng duely 
examined and conuycted by the 
learned Phisitions of the dioces) 
should haue condigue punishment 
appoynted them by the Byshop or 
his chauncelour. 
 
[}The fyfthe}] 
 
That no Phisition do take vpon 
him the name of anye degree of 
Schole, as bachelour, maister of 
Arte, or doctor: or cause and permit 
any writer or printer so to terme 
him, vnles he can approue it to be 
so in dede by any vniuersitie. 
 
[^f.B8r^] 
[}The syxte.}] 
 
That no midwise should disdayne 
to come aske counsell of the Phisition, 
as often as any woman beyng 
in laboure of childe, is in danger. 
It were good also that the 
midwiues wer first sworne to the 
byshoppe, before they take vppon 
them their office. 
 
[}The seuenth.}] 
 
It were also good and expediente 
that (as the vse of London is, grau~ted 
by an acte of Parliament) that 
the Phisitions in euery other dioces 
one or two, or more, shold haue 
licence of the byshop, to searche and 
vewe the poticaries shoppe once a 
yere at the leaste, and see whether 
their stuffe and medecines be good 
and lawfull or not. 
 
These Articles aboue rehearsed 
I thought good here to allege, 
[^f.B8v^] 
(although vnder correction of my 
superiors) because that some occasion 
may be geuen to refourme the 
enormities and abuses in the science 
of Phisicke. And here let no 
man think, that I meane to speake 
any thing in any point against the 
priuileges & liberties graunted by 
an act of Parliament to the company 
or corporation of the Phisitio~s 
of London, for I mynde not, nor 
may not medle with their priuileges. 
 
Many ther are, that beare them 
selues very stout, vpon an act that 
was made by king Henry the .viij. 
his dayes, affirmyng that acte to 
make full and wholly in al pointes 
for their purpose, but they are fowly 
deceaued and farre beyonde the 
marke that they shote at. For wher 
as the acte presupposeth in them a 
[^f.C1r^] 
knowledge of the symples, as of 
herbes, rootes, and waters, and of 
the vertue and operation of them. 
Alas, they can scant tell what a simple 
meaneth: There be a great nu~ber 
of the~ that knoweth not these 
common herbes, Buglossum, Apiu~ 
& agrimonia, for in steede of Buglossum, 
whiche is bourage, they 
will take buglose, beyng deceaued 
by the sound of the word: for agrimonia 
the true Eupatorium. They 
will take Eupatorium Mesue, whiche 
is described of Dioscorides vnder 
the name of ageratum: for apium 
persely, they take commonlye 
smallage: for Scolopendria called 
otherwise ceterach, they abuse hart 
stong. And to be short, I my selfe 
haue sene som Poticaries take for 
the roote of rubia, the leaues of 
rubus: for the roote of Mandragora, 
[^f.C1v^] 
the roote of Gentian: for Hematites, 
Amethystus: for Semperuiuum minus, 
the herb called thrist 
or greate Stonecrope, they haue 
taken litle Stonecrope in making 
their Populeum. 
 
To the purpose, where as the 
acte presupposeth a speculation or 
practise, they practise at a venture 
a thynge whiche they knowe not, 
whether it be colde or hotte, drye, 
or moyste. 
 
Item, where as the Act geueth 
them licence to mynister drynkes 
for the stone, strangurie, & agues: 
They knowe not the stone in the 
back, from the stone in the blader: 
neither whether the stone may be 
wasted and broke~ by drinkes and 
powders, or had out by incision. 
Moreouer thei know no differe~ce 
betwene a colyke and a stone: for 
[^f.C2r^] 
they name them bothe one, where 
as they be two sundry diseases. 
 
They know not what Stranguria 
is, nor how many maner of ways 
it may be engendred in the bodye. 
They can scant discerne a tertian 
ague from a quotidian. As for the 
mixt and complicate agues, they 
know not what to make of them 
They call them newe diseases, because 
they can geue them no other 
name. 
 
Nowe in good faithe, yf these 
ioly felowes had but that knowledge 
onely, which the said act presupposeth 
theym to haue: it were 
not so great a danger, if they some 
tymes were permytted to geue 
some medicines for the foresayde 
dyseases. But I praye you, 
howe manye of theym haue that 
litle knowledge? which knowlege 
[^f.C2v^] 
is but lyttle in dede in comparison 
of many other sciences, whiche be 
not onely profitable, but also necessary 
to attayne the noble science 
of phisike. If the other actes which 
hath ben made for the reformation 
of Physike, be well scanned & conferred 
togither one with an other, 
it shal plainly appere, that the afore 
named act, shal not make so greatly 
for theyr purpose, who by ignorance 
and rashnesse do vse to practise 
phisike at theyr pleasure. 
 
Verily I muche meruaile at one 
thynge that many which be of the 
higher sort, reputing them selues to 
be of no small grauitie & wisedom 
will sometymes geue credite to suche 
lewde persons, counterfayting 
the phisitions. In dede I suppose 
that they be partly deceiued by the 
vain persuasions & faire flattering 
[^f.C3r^] 
speche of suche fellowes. Their co~munication 
is so faire, swete, gentill, 
plesant and amiable: and their 
promise and waranting so earnest 
and great, that they will go nye to 
deceaue the wisest man that is, yf 
he haue not the more grace, and be 
very ware of them. And the better 
to allure the symple people vnto 
them: They wil say to him who~ 
they do take in hand: Syr, I will 
nonne of your money nowe vntil 
you be whole: I will haue money 
only of you for the medicins, whiche 
I must occupy for your disese. 
They wyll lyghtly warrant euery 
manne to heale hym, of what disease 
soeuer he hath: And for all diseases 
they haue co~monly but two 
or three sortes of medicines, and 
yet moste commonly they be purgations 
or vomites. 
 
[^f.C3v^] 
They purge so muche and so often, 
that they purge many tymes 
as wel the sowle out of the body, 
as the money out of the purse. 
 
Moreouer, these fellowes will also 
(to haue the more credite geuen 
vnto them) name them selues after 
som great lerned mans name. 
Somtimes they fain them selues 
to be of some straunge countrey, 
and wyll counterfayte their language 
(As I know one in Salisbury) 
and loke to be called by som 
name of dignitie or worshyp: as 
Maister, gentylman, domine, doctour, 
and al to deceaue the people. 
 
O I would wyshe, that euery 
man woulde take hede, and I beseche 
God that euery man may be 
ware of suche false Physytions, 
whyche maye be lykened to wolues 
or foxes, clothed outwardlye 
[^f.C4r^] 
with lambes skyns, but inwardly 
are full of subtiltie and deceite. 
Many perishe through the yere at 
their hands, wherby the good science 
of physike is brought into an 
obloquie and reproche. 
 
Many learned doctours of oure 
time haue in their works inueyed 
greatly agaynst these abuses, and 
haue wished som punishme~t to be 
establyshed by the Maiestrates, 
vnto such as wickedly and without 
all reason mysuse and practise 
this science. 
 
Here I coulde also somewhat 
touch some of the lerned sort, whiche 
although they bere themselues 
neuer so stoute, and appere to me~ 
to do all things wel: yet neuerthelesse, 
they halt somtimes on bothe 
sides: They se & know many abuses 
in y=e= poticaries shops, and yet 
[^f.C4v^] 
they winke at the matter, and are 
loth to displease the poticarie, who 
perchance is their frende. But the 
prouerbe saithe: Amicus Socrates, 
amicus Plato, Amica tamen magis 
veritas, The truthe ought to take 
place in all thynges, and aboue all 
thynges. 
 
There be also many phisitions, 
that thynketh them selues so profou~dly 
lerned, that they beleue that 
no man is able to match with the~ 
in lerning, they be so arrogant and 
scornful, that although the pacient 
hymself be content to haue the cou~sayle 
of two or three other phisitions, 
to consult and conferre togither 
of hys disease: yet they wyll 
not wyllyngely graunte to it, but 
rather disdayne to conferre with 
any other, the whyche perchance 
are sommetymes a greatte deale 
[^f.C5r^] 
better learned then they are. They 
remember not what Hippocrates 
their maister saith, in his booke de 
preceptionibus, who being in Latin 
translated saith thus: Nec vero 
indecore se illegeret medicus, quiin 
rei præsentis augustia circa ægrum 
aliquem, et imperitia tenebras offunde~te, 
alios quoq~ accersere iusserit, 
quo ex co~muni consideratione, 
res circa egrum inquirantur accognoscantur, 
& illi cooperatores fiant 
ad auxilii ferendi facultate~. The englishe 
is thus: That phisition shall 
not do amisse, nor behaue himselfe 
vncomly, which beyng as perplex 
in the busines about his paciente, 
and doubtfull for want of perfecte 
knowledge: do cause other phisitions 
to be called, that by common 
deliberation, and conferringe one 
with an other, y=e= pacientes affaires 
[^f.C5v^] 
may be dewly examined and knowe~, 
so that they may be as coadiutors 
(y=t= is to say, helpers one to an 
other) to prouide for some remedy. 
Some there be also (leste I wene 
that other men should learne their 
cunning) that wil rather scrible the~ 
write a recept, and will make such 
dashes and strange abbreuiations 
in theyr billes, that theyr writinge 
semeth rather to be arabicke, or like 
the writinges of the Cabalistes, 
then Latin. I feare me that they 
that write so, are ashamed of their 
owne occupation, and feare leaste 
that if they shoulde write playne, 
their errours and faultes shoulde 
be espied. He that is a playne man 
will deale playnelye, will speake 
playnely, and write playnely. 
 
Some ther be also that be so stiffe 
necked & heady in theyr opinions, 
[^f.C6r^] 
that they will be of no man gainsayde 
in no wyse, no and if you 
bringe them neuer so good a reason, 
although you alledge them neuer 
so many authorities. 
 
But I say, Plus vident duo oculi 
q~ vnus. All the wit of the worlde 
lyeth not in one mans heade. Ther 
fore to conferre together vppon a 
matter, it doeth oftentimes greate 
good, and no man (be he neuer so 
well learned) ought to refuse it, as 
often as time, place, or any other occasion 
shall serue. 
 
Item, some phisitions ther be, that 
be so greedy and of so an vnsaciable 
desier, that they care and passe 
not in what daunger they caste 
them selues in, what shame & damage 
they sustain, so that thei may 
haue many cures, wher somtimes 
[^f.C6v^] 
one would suffice the~ well enough 
and be more perchaunce then they 
can well bring to passe. They be so 
couetous that they wold haue all, 
and do al them selfe, and they haue 
enuy many tymes at other honest 
men hauing cures, when they haue 
none. Thys doinge verelye they 
bringe them selues in greate contempte, 
and dothe as it were abate 
and blemishe the honorable science 
of phisicke, which requireth rather 
to be sought earnestly with greate 
sute, with humilitie, reuerence and 
prayinge, then to be offered, and as 
it were obiected vndiscretely to euery 
man, and in euery place, lyke 
a blinde harpers songe or a Pedlars 
packe. The common prouerbe 
saith, that offered seruice stynketh. 
And I haue harde oftentymes 
saye, that phisicke vnles it be earnestly 
[^f.C7r^] 
sought and well payde for, 
it will neuer prosper nor woorke 
well with the pacientes, I meane 
not by this but that the Phisition 
muste be alwayes liberall and mercifull 
to the poore, on whom his liuing 
dependeth not but on the rich 
Nowe to conclude and finish this 
fyrst part, I will leaue to intreate 
any more of phisitions, (except as 
occasion shall serue) and nowe in 
the next parte followinge I will 
speake of poticaries, & touche somwhat 
their abuse and negligence. 
Whosoeuer wil read anye more of 
the tokens and qualities of folishe 
and blynd phisitions: Let him rede 
a litle boke of mine, printed about a 
dose~ yeres past, which is intituled: 
A gret Galley lately com into England 
out of Terra noua, laden with 
phisitions, poticaries & surgio~s. &c. 
made in forme of a dialoge. 
 
[^f.C7v^] 
[}The Seconde parte intreateth 
of the ignoraunce 
and presumption of 
certayne Poticaries.}] 
 
IT is not vnknowen 
to many me~, 
and speciallye to 
those that be truly 
and exactly lerned 
in phisick, that ther 
hath bene, is now, yea and shall be 
(if some good order be not taken) 
great abuses among poticaries, in 
handling, keping, chosing and dressing 
their drouges and medecines. 
In so much, that it is suspected of 
most part of men (and I pray god 
it be not so in dede) that amonge 
all other mechanicke artes or occupations, 
the greatest & most crafty 
[^f._C8r^] 
deceate that is, is or may be in poticaries. 
Howbeit, I am not ignoraunt, 
but that within these fewe 
yeres, some poticaries, by the helpe 
and counsell of good Phisitions, 
haue gotten and prouided for better 
stuffe & simples to make their 
compositions, then they wer wont 
to haue afore. 
 
And I beleue verely, that if euery 
poticarie would endeuour himself 
to bye no stuffe, but that should be 
pure and good: there woulde be a 
great meany, that would geue better 
credite to phisitions and Poticaries, 
and haue a better hope in 
them, then they haue now a daies, 
and all because they mistrust and 
suspecte so muche the Poticaries 
stuffe and confections. In dede, 
as couetousnes is the roote of all 
euyll, so many poticaries there be, 
[^f.C8v^] 
that more for lucre sake and gredines 
of worldly goodes, do prepare 
their medicines, then for any care 
that they haue, to deale truly with 
the poore pacientes and sely soules 
that be in payne. The phisition many 
tymes shall ordeyne his counsell, 
and appoynt certayne medecines 
for his pacient: which medecines 
he knoweth certainly shal do 
him good, beynge taken and vsed 
accordinge to his counsell, yet the 
same medecines beyng taken and 
bought at the poticaries, and made 
many tymes of noughty stuffe, or 
not well prepared, shal not only do 
litle or no good at all, but shall also 
somtimes put the sicke body in hasarde 
of his lyfe, whereby shall no 
small trouble and shame redounde 
vnto the phisition, and yet was he 
not the occasion thereof, nor in any 
[^f.D1r^] 
fault at all. Some perchance wil 
alledge agaynst the physition, that 
he maye bee in the faulte, for as 
muche as he ought to haue seene 
the stuffe fyrste, whereof the compositions 
are made, and ought also 
to haue ben at the makyng and 
preparyng of the medicines whiche 
he ordeyneth. 
 
In dede it ought to be so, if all 
thynges went well, and specially 
if the poticary be suspected to haue 
somwhat a large co~science, or that 
he be of a slender learnynge and 
negligente, and passeth not what 
he doothe, so that he may receyue 
money. But you must vndersta~d 
that the physition can not alwais 
be present at the makyng or delyuerynge 
of suche medicines as he 
hath appointed. For somtymes he 
hath mo pacientes to loke to then 
[^f.D1v^] 
one, & perchance he may be twentie 
or forty myles from the poticarie, 
when he sendeth his bylle to 
hym, and therefore can not be present. 
Many other occasions there 
bee, that letteth the presence of the 
phisition at the makynge and delyueryng 
of medicines. 
 
But yf the apothecarie be an honest 
man, of a good conscience and 
learned: Or that he hathe suche a 
one vnder hym to serue the shoppe 
that is of lyke qualities: It is not 
then so greatly necessary for the phisytion 
to be present, so often as he 
ordeyneth his counsayle for anye 
paciente. For euen as a good tree 
wyll alwayes brynge foorth good 
fruite: So wyll a good poticarye 
make and delyuer nothynge at anye 
tyme, but that that is lawefull 
and good. But this question 
[^f.D2r^] 
(yf a man moughte be so bolde) I 
woulde fayne aske, howe manye 
good apoticaries bee there in England? 
howe many doo theyr dueties 
as they oughte to doo? Howe 
many are learned? howe many are 
faithfull? and howe many are willyng 
and desyrous that the physitions 
shoulde see theyr drouges, and 
see the makynge of their compositions? 
Many ther be, that disdayn 
that the Physitions should be presente 
at the makyng of theyr medicins, 
and who more then the ignorant, 
couetous & co~tentious sort 
of poticaries. The ignora~t thynkes 
(folowyng their barbarous Nicolans) 
that their knowlege (whiche 
is mere ignorance) farre excellethe 
and surmounteth the knowledge 
of all Physitions. The couetous 
ar aferd, lest yf the physitio~s shuld 
[^f.D2v^] 
be present they should find a great 
deale of theyr stuffe to be sophisticate, 
corrupt and nought. 
 
There be also an other sorte of 
Poticaries, which be so arrogant 
and scornfull (by reason that they 
be growen in greate richesse God 
knoweth how) that they disdayn 
the Physition, and haue hym in 
no estimation, where as in the ancient 
tyme, the poticaries (as Galene 
and other wytnesseth) were 
but as seruauntes and ministers 
vnto the Physition. Galen in the 
commentaries vpon the .vi. boke 
of Hippocrates, de morbis vulgaribus 
saythe thus: The ministers of 
the phisition, are gatherers of herbes, 
oyntemente makers, cookes, 
playster makers, clyster geuers, 
scarifiers, letters out of bloud. &c. 
but yf we (meanyng of physitio~s 
[^f.D3r^] 
after y=t= we haue lerned these thinges, 
do also somtimes the like: we 
doo no otherwise then euen as a 
maister or gouerner of a shyppe, 
whyche hauynge knoweledge in 
rowyng, do rowe when he lyste, 
and get vp to the top of the mast, 
and dothe all other thynges belongyng 
to the mariners arte and office. 
Thus muche Galene. 
 
I neede not to alledge here the 
xxxviii. chapter of Ecclesiasticus, 
where euery manne is exhorted to 
honour the physition: how much 
more then should the poticarie honour 
and reuerence hym, whiche 
hath chiefly his liuyng by meanes 
of the physition. I speake not this 
bycause I or any physition should 
seke worldly honor, or vain glory. 
For aboue all thynges: Soli Deo 
sit honor & gloria. yet not withstandyng, 
[^f.D3v^] 
accordynge to Saincte 
Pauls doctrine, we ought to geue 
honour, to whome honour belongeth. 
I remembre that whenne I 
was yet in a maner but a boye in 
age, studying beyonde the sea, after 
a yeare or two that I had studied 
in physicke: I woulde somtymes 
(for to haue the better knowledge 
in symples) resorte to some poticaries 
shoppe or other. But I should 
no rather come into the shop (specially 
of learned and honeste men) 
but that immediately, The poticarie 
woulde welcome and receyue 
me with all curteisye and humanitie, 
and ryse from his seate to geue 
me roume, and so woulde entertayn 
me with all gentylnes that he 
mought. This dyd they to me being 
then but a scholer: what would 
thei do think you to the maisters & 
[^f.D4r^] 
doctours of phisike? What maketh 
many poticaries now a days to set 
so litle by the phisitio~s. This is one 
chief cause: They play the phisitions 
them selues, they geue and minister 
medicins of their own deuise (god 
wote a mad deuise) indifferentely 
vnto all me~: yea and the more ignorant 
they are, the more bolder they 
be. For who is so bold as blind bayard? 
Many of the~ wil not sticke to 
loke in waters, & be not ashamed euen 
in the phisitions presence, to ordeyn 
this or that medicine for any 
kind of disease: If any phisition do 
gently admonysh the~ of their fault 
& specially of geuyng of medicines 
after their owne brayne: They wyl 
say, that they may as well prescribe 
medicines, as Physitions somtymes 
doo vse to make them. They 
may playe (saye they) as well the 
[^f.D4v^] 
Physitions, as the physitions play 
the poticaries, as though a physition 
and a poticary were all one. 
In dede a physition may be a poticarie, 
and haue a poticaries shop 
within hymself in his owne hous 
or maye be a Surgeon, and heale 
wou~des or sores, or let bloud him 
selfe: Sed non e diuerso. A Poticarie 
or Surgeon beyng onely of 
that arte may not be a physition, 
vnlesse he abuse and falsely exercise 
against all reason and conscience, 
(as many do nowe a days) 
the science of physike. 
 
To proue that a physition may 
make or cause to bee made in hys 
owne house, any kynd of medicines: 
it may partely appere by the 
authoritie of Galene afore alledged, 
and also by dyuers other famous 
authors of our tyme, and 
[^f.D5r^] 
specially by Manardus and Siluius. 
Manardus in the prologe prefixed 
to the annotations vpon Mesue, 
hath these wordes: In times paste 
saithe he, the phisitions themselues 
prepared the medicines at theyr 
own houses, and so kept them ready 
made, the whiche as often as 
nede required, accordinge to their 
discretion and the necessitie of the 
sicke, they vsed. But sins these fiue 
hundred yeres or there about, this 
kind of busines hath bene committed, 
or rather deriued from the phisitions 
(not withoute as I beleue 
the danger of the pacientes) vnto 
certayne, which are called spicers, 
or Poticaries. &c. 
 
Iacobus Siluius in his boke de medicamentorum 
simplicium delectu, 
in the beginninge, wheras he speaketh 
of the dewty of a Poticarie: 
[^f.D5v^] 
declareth, that as well Galen as other 
phisitions did oftentimes prepare 
the medecines them selues. It 
is lawfull then for the phisition (if 
he lyste) to prepare the medecines 
for his paciente him selfe: but not 
lawfull for the poticarie, to vse or 
practise phisicke for any man, of his 
owne heade. 
 
I wold wish that the poticarie, as 
he is desirous of gayne, so he wold 
prouide for all things necessary for 
his shop, and chiefly and fyrst of al, 
for the chiefe guide & Instrument, 
that shold rule al the rost, I meane 
the boke of Bernardus Dessennius 
Cronenburgius, de compositione 
medicame~torum: The perfectest in 
my opinion, & most excellent booke 
I beleue, that euer was made for 
poticaries. Howbeit, because that 
some phisitions vseth the compositions 
[^f.D6r^] 
of other authors: I would 
wish also, that y=e= poticarie mought 
not be without the dispensatories 
of Valerius Cordus, of Fuchsius, or 
Nicolaus Mirepsus, or the .ii. bokes 
of Siluius, contening the chosinge, 
kepinge, and making of medicines 
commonlye vsed: or Examen tam 
simplicium q~ compositorum, Antonij 
Muse: and not to followe still 
their blinde Nicolaus Præpositus, 
which is full of errours. It were 
mete and conuenient also, that the 
Poticaries had diuers searces to 
searce their powders in, for some 
powders would be searced verye 
fynely, as they that be diureticke 
powders, and most parte of Electuaries: 
some more grossye, as the 
most part of laxatiues, except agaricke 
and colocinthis. 
 
[^f.D6v^] 
Of morters likewyse they ought to 
haue diuers sortes, for all preciouse 
stones (that entre into Electuaries) 
and coral, ought not to be beaten 
in a brasen morter, but perles & 
corall ought to be beaten in a morter 
of whit marble, precious stones 
must be made or grinded into pouder, 
vppon a stone called in latin 
Lapis porphirius. which is a kinde 
of red marble. Also purgations or 
electuaries, pilles or pouders mengled 
with any Syroppes oughte 
not to be dissolued in brasen morters, 
but in morters of Glasse, of 
stone, or of som fine wood, yea and 
yf they were of Syluer for greate 
men of highe degree, it were beste. 
Also some oyntmentes ought to be 
made in morters of leade. 
 
It were good also that no kynd of 
poyson, should be pownded or dissolued, 
[^f.D7r^] 
in anye morters occupied 
dayly for the shoppe, for therof hath 
chaunced muche euill. 
 
I had almost forgotten one greate 
abuse, that a great many poticaries 
commonly do vse, that is when the 
phisition prescribeth any losengis 
to be made: The poticarie will put 
to the powder, as muche suger as 
pleaseth him, in so much that many 
times the losengis shall haue litle 
other taste, then of the suger onely. 
Fuchsius willeth that there should 
be but thrise as muche suger as is 
of the pouder, so that to thre drams 
of powder, there should be put but 
an ounce and a litle more of suger, 
howe be it that some other (as he 
saith) do vse to put fowre times as 
much suger as of the powder. But 
Dessennius Cronemburgius saith, 
that the phisitions put co~monly a 
[^f.D7v^] 
a pound of suger, to an ounce of 
powder. And to say my fancie and 
opinion: it were good that the phisition 
should determine & appointe 
in his byll, howe muche suger he 
wold haue to be put with the powder. 
For somtimes it hapneth that 
he ordeineth a purgation in losengis: 
somtimes he vseth some bitter 
powder, or very hote powder, that 
requireth of suger more or lesse: but 
c~mo~ly bitter or very hot pouders 
require more suger: and pleasant & 
temperat pouders require lesse: but 
many poticaries are very liberall, 
which spare for no suger, whe~ they 
make losengis, because they haue 
more respecte to their profite, then 
to the pacientes healthe. Agayne 
they loue to make all thynges 
pleasaunt and swete, so that swete 
money maye come in. And it is 
[^f.D8r^] 
mooste commonlye seene, that the 
moste parte of sicke folke abhorre 
swete things. Wherfore, they shold 
know of the phisition (vnles he determine 
it him selfe in his bill) how 
much suger he will haue to the making 
of the medecines. 
 
Nowe at the laste to conclude, 
because that poticaries shall know 
partely what theyr dewtie is, I 
will here recite what Siluius saith 
in the place afore alleged, of the poticaries 
duety. And thus I haue 
translated his preface into english. 
 
Althoughe that the Poticarie 
be endewed with many thynges, 
commonlye agreynge with 
the Phisition: as with natural discretion, 
a perfect knowledge of the 
medicines, a gret dilige~ce in al such 
things as belong to his office, & an 
honest behauiour: yet neuerthelesse 
[^f.D8v^] 
many thinges are in a maner peculiarely 
appropriated vnto him, the 
which somtimes were also proper 
and belonging vnto the phisitions, 
at what time they them selues prepared 
the medicines, as it appereth 
that Galen should haue done it, in 
manye places by his writinges. 
Nowe suche thinges as be proper 
to the poticaries are these: The chosinge 
of medecines gotten by discretion 
and longe experience, afterward 
the maner to kepe them, and 
to knowe the time when they are 
in their power and force, or when 
they are destitute from all vertue 
aned corrupt. Also, howe and in 
what maner eche of them ought to 
be vsed, eyther by it selfe alone, or 
els to sethe it, or to bruse or breake 
it with other, or to prepare it after 
an other sort and maner. It is also 
[^f.E1r^] 
conuenient and necessary for a poticarie 
to knowe his grammer, because 
he may the better vnderstand 
the compositions of the aunciente 
writers, and also the dayly writinges 
(which commonly they call receptes 
or billes) of the Phisitions. 
In the whiche writinges, if perhappes 
they haue write~ any thing 
more or lesse then nede is, or more 
vnplesaunt then the poticarie coniectureth 
in him selfe, to be mete & 
conuenient for the pacient: he then 
may gently tel and warne the phisition 
of it. 
 
Moreouer we would that the poticarie 
knewe perfectly the art and 
science to choose the medicines, to 
prepare them, and to compou~d the~ 
together. We would also haue him 
to be contented with a meane apparell, 
to be mery and pleasaunt in 
[^f.E1v^] 
co~munication after an honest sort, 
dilige~t in the pacientes busines, to 
be no couetous, no lasciuious, no 
dronkerd nor contentious person: 
all which thinges are euen in lyke 
maner to be obserued of the phisition 
as of the poticarie, as Hippocrates 
testifieth in his boke called 
the office or duety of a phisition. 
 
And if the poticarie be indewed 
with such perfections of spirite, of 
the bodie & also of fortune: he will 
neuer geue any medecine (specially 
being of any gret operation) to any 
man, vnles he be of the counsell of 
some cunning phisition, nay nether 
will he geue any thing, be it of neuer 
so litle effect, knowing not the 
vertue of it. For ofte~times certayn 
remedies, although they seme but 
weake, yet neuerthelesse throughe 
quantitie, qualitie and space of time 
[^f.E2r^] 
beyng vnholesome, or the occasion 
many times of great diseases, and 
taketh away the righte and trewe 
way of curation: In so much that 
vnder such remedies, the bodie beinge 
in cure, will sone afterwarde 
beare greater & stronger remedies, 
but not conuenient to the purpose. 
Moreouer he shal not commit any 
crime or fault, either for loue or fauoure, 
or for hatred or feare: nor he 
may not be seduced by money or led 
by ignorance. Neither shal he geue 
at any time any poyson, or thinges 
procuring abortion, any thing that 
is to olde or out of vse, thinges altered 
and sophisticate, or any quid 
pro quo. But he shall aske counsell, 
(as often as nede shal require) 
of a well learned Phisition, what 
simple or compounde medycyne 
is to be substytuted and taken, 
[^f.E2v^] 
for lacke one of the other. Hee 
shall not augment nor fortifie the 
quantitie of any strong medicine, 
to the intent that by a greater euacuation 
ensuyng, men should suppose 
him to haue better poticaries 
stuffe then any other. 
 
Oh I wolde the Apothecaries 
of these days woulde frame them 
selues to this rule, and the Physitions 
lykewise on their syde, phisycke 
shoulde not then be so lyttell 
regarded and set by, as it is now 
adayes: yea by opprobrious wordes 
and tantes despised of a great 
many. Nowe I beseche the Almyghtye 
and lyuynge God, that 
ones he woulde make the Physitions 
and Apothecaries to be of 
that desyre and mynde, that eche 
of theym woulde rather wysshe 
to bee in dede, then to seeme or to 
[^f.E3r^] 
be called a ryght, good, and honest 
physition, a right good and honest 
Apothecarie. 
 
And yf they doo neglecte that 
goodlye gyfte and grace, I praye 
God that ones some punyshment 
maye be appointed by the kynges 
lawes and statutes for them, whiche 
will enterprise to practise a science 
(so healthy to mannes body, 
when it is well mynistred, and agayne 
so hurtefull and daungerous, 
when it is ignorantlye and 
rashely handled) before they know 
it. Thus muche Syluius. 
And here I wil make an 
ende of Apothecaries, 
now to the Surgeons. 
 
[^f.E3v^] 
[}THE THIRD PART 
speaketh of the rashe boldnesse 
and ignoraunce of 
diuers Surgions}] 
 
THere be many surgions 
in this oure 
time, that practise 
surgerie, more by 
blynde experience, 
then by any scie~ce, 
who in vsing many thinges apperteining 
to their arte, knowe almost 
the vertue and operation of nothinge 
that they do vse. For howe 
shoulde they knowe it, when they 
are altogether vnlearned? yea and 
many of them there are that know 
neuer a letter in the booke. Where 
[^f.E4r^] 
as Surgerie beynge counted as 
one of the chiefest parts of phisike, 
(hauynge hys practise chiefely in 
the time of warre) it were necessarie 
that the Surgion were not 
onely prompte, feate and diligent 
in hys doynges, but also that he 
were well learned in philosophie 
and phisicke, and also somewhat in 
Astronomie. 
 
But howe manye shall a man 
fynde in a countrey that haue learnynge? 
howe many are there that 
procede in theyr cures trewly and 
vprightly as they ought? not very 
many I beleue. For the mooste 
parte beyng ignoraunte and voyde 
of al good learning, yea and know 
almost no part of anatomie (which 
is most necessarie for a Surgion) 
can not scarse heale a grene wou~d, 
[^f.E4v^] 
and some there bee that can scante 
let a man bloud (which is a handsome 
and pretie feate, and yet not 
so harde a thyng to be doone) nor 
well apply a ventose called otherwyse 
a cupping glasse, vnlesse they 
put the man to peyne and trouble. 
There be some that esteeme themselues 
so wel exercised and perfect 
in the arte, that they thynke that 
no cure can come amisse to them: 
They wyll enterprise and take in 
hande all maner of cures, be they 
neuer so hard or incurable: for they 
haue feare of nothyng, but rashely 
go to worke in all thynges. They 
wyll cutte, they wyll launce, they 
wyll cauterise (whyche they calle 
searyng with a hot burning yron) 
they wyll sawe of a legge or an 
arme of the bodye, they wyll vse 
corrosiues that shall pearce euen 
[^f.E5r^] 
vnto the hard bones, and they wil 
make an issue almoste for euery 
trifle, and for euery disease, without 
consyderynge the circumstances 
of the whole matter, not weyeng 
the strengthe, the age, and the 
complexion of the bodye, besydes 
many other things that are greatly 
to be consydered in suche cases. 
And possible it is many times that 
the paciente hathe nede of some inwarde 
medicine, whiche the surgion 
can nor may wel geue without 
the Physitions counsayle 
 
And in dede it were very mete 
and necessarie, that the Surgion 
should vndertake no hard or dangerous 
cure, without the phisitio~s 
aduyse. Howbeit as I see nowe a 
dayes, the most part of them do al 
thynges, followynge onely theyr 
owne fantasies. 
 
[^f.E5v^] 
They sticke not to geue Electuaries, 
syropes, and other medicines 
them selues, yea and purgations also: 
which thinge me semeth is very 
vncomely. It is not reason that he 
that shoulde be but as a minister 
vnto the phisition (as I alleged before 
out of Galen, when I intreated 
of Poticaries) shoulde vse the 
parte of a maister and philosopher, 
and ordeyne suche thinges as he 
knoweth nothing the nature of. It 
is not vnknowen, that many pore 
pacientes perisheth vnder suche 
rashe and lewde surgions. 
 
But to saye the trueth, the fault is 
not so muche in them, as in those 
that geue credite vnto them. For 
as the world goeth nowe a daies, 
if a phisition or surgion hath a faire 
tonge, & hath also som what a comly 
bodie, and can speake (I wil not 
[^f.E6r^] 
saye flatter) indifferently on euery 
mans side, gratifying eche man accordinge 
to his qualitie, desire and 
minde: euery man vnles he be very 
wise & circumspect, wil lightly geue 
care and credite vnto him, & acco~pt 
him for a discret and conning ma~. 
Suche a one shall lacke nothing, 
he shall be welcome, he shall haue 
much curtesie and pleasure shewed 
him, finally he shal haue his whole 
hartes desire, (y=t= is money enough) 
For such felowes by their subtyltie 
and fayre tongue, will allure more 
people vnto them, & get them selues 
more treasure in one quarter of a 
yere, then shal an honest and good 
phisition in the space of thre yeres, 
and all by their fleringe face & flattering 
wordes. 
 
I would to god that al men wold 
beware of such felowes, & reme~ber 
[^f.E6v^] 
the prouerbe that saith: Dulci sub 
melle sæpe venena latent. Vnder 
swete meats is many times a poyson 
hidde. And as Virgill saithe: 
Hinc procul o pueri fugite, later anguis 
in herba, Take hede and flee 
farre hence O childre~, for the snake 
lieth priuily hid vnder the grasse. 
 
It is written in the auncient authors 
of Phisicke, that in the olde 
time, the phisitions were wonte to 
exercise surgerie themselues. Howe 
beit it hath bene nowe of a longe 
time, that the Surgions do onely 
exercise this part of phisicke for many 
considerations, and chiefely for 
this occasion, as Hippocrates saith 
Vita breuis, ars vero longa The life 
of man is shorte in comparison of 
the science of Phisicke whiche is 
longe. Therfore because the Phisitions 
can not well geue theym 
[^f.E7r^] 
selues to studie diuers other sciences: 
whiche be necessary to phisicke 
and make medecines, and vse also 
surgerie, and go & visit their pacientes: 
It hath bene thought good 
that other men called Surgions 
(and yet hauing sufficiente knowlege) 
should haue the office and ministerie 
to vse and applie outward 
medecines, and not to enterprise 
and vse all medecines for all diseases 
both outward and inward, as 
some doeth, for in so doyng they go 
beyond their bondes. 
 
Surgerie although it be a manuell 
arte, yet it hath his speculation, 
whiche can not be had without 
readynge of diuers authors, 
and specially Hippocrates, Galen, 
Aetius, Paulus Ægineta, and of the 
latter writers, Tagaultius, Hollerius, 
Bologuinus and others. As 
[^f.E7v^] 
for Iohannes de Vigo, whom the 
Surgions of our daies doo now 
most follow, I wold not that they 
should so greatly trust him, because 
that he is not to be folowed & read 
without great discretion & Iudgement, 
for the obscuritie & doubtes, 
yea and errours that be in him. He 
bringeth in manye thinges in his 
boke, which belongeth rather to the 
phisition to knowe & practise, then 
to the Surgion: as Electuaries, 
potions, purgations & many other 
inward medicines. If the Surgio~ 
haue knowledge in Phisicke, I 
meane that he know the complexions, 
the nature of simples, and the 
effect & operation of compositions: 
he may vse them, els not. For if he 
do, he shal do as the blind man shoteth 
at the hare, he shal worke at al 
aduentures, and many times with 
[^f.E8r^] 
the danger of his pacient. 
 
I much maruell, why the surgion 
should disdayne to come aske counsell 
of the Phisition, when he hath 
any hard or doubtfull cure, it can 
be no hindrance to him, and to saye 
the trueth, it is no great profite to 
the phisitian, vnles it be for some 
riche man. The good phisition will 
vse the poore as the poore: and the 
riche partly for his money as well 
as for his loue and frendship. For 
the phisition must haue his liuyng 
by some kinde of persons. And not 
onely the phisition, but also the poticarie 
and Surgion should deale 
charitably with the poore, & vse euery 
man accordyng to hys capacity. 
But this I haue spoken, Vel ut obiter, 
as by the way: Nowe to the 
purpose. 
 
Manye perchaunce wyll saye 
[^f.E8v^] 
vnto me, what nedeth the Surgion 
come aske anye counsell of the 
phisition for any cure that he taketh 
in hande, where as it is well knowen 
y=t= the phisitions lightly (except 
one among a hundreth) do not vse 
to practise Surgerie them selues, 
and by this meanes can not instruct 
the Surgion in that thinge, 
that they knowe not. I answere 
that the moste parte of the authors 
of phisicke intreateth of surgerie in 
their woorkes, and althoughe we 
meddle litle or nothinge with outward 
diseases: yet doo we knowe 
what belongeth to them, and how 
they ought to be cured. And I saye 
 
also that Surgerie can neuer be 
well practised without learninge, 
or a reasonable waye of proceding 
which is called in Latin Rationalis 
methodus, the whiche the moste 
[^f.F1r^] 
part of Surgions haue not. As 
for example: A man hath an hote 
inflamation, or (as commonly they 
call it) a swelling or impostume in 
some outwarde parte of his body, 
and feeleth great payne. What remedie 
shall the surgion vse for the 
expelling of it? he must fyrst consider 
what is the nature and qualitie 
of an inflamation, called in Greke 
Phlegmone, whether it be engendred 
of pure bloud only, or els mixed 
with any other humoure: what 
is the cause of it, and what be the 
signes? 
 
Nowe let vs suppose that the sayd 
Phlegmon be ingendred onely of a 
superfluous bloude, and the cause 
antecedent be Plethora, that is aboundance 
of good blood in all the 
body. Now what shall the Surgion 
do in suche a case? shall he applye 
[^f.F1v^] 
any thinge to the swellinge, 
without considering whether the 
body must be let bloud or not? whether 
the swellinge or phlegmon be 
yet in fluxu, that is a breding: or in 
statu, that is in the worst case that 
it can be: or in the declination? whether 
or when he ought to vse repercussiues, 
resolutions, or both together? 
The generall rule of Phisicke 
saithe, that in the beginning of all 
inflamations, we should vse repercussiues, 
that is medecines to repel 
and driue backe the fluxion of humours: 
But I put the case that the 
swelling be in the Emunctories, or 
that one hath the pestilence: The 
surgion perhappes folowinge the 
generall rule, will laye a plaster to 
repell the said inflamation or swellinge. 
Doth he well thinke you? he 
doth so well that eyther he putteth 
[^f.F2r^] 
the pacient in great ieopardy, or els 
he killeth him quite. 
 
Wherfore the surgion must thinke 
that a great many things must be 
considred mo then one, as often as 
he vndertaketh any cure of weight 
And muste thinke it no shame nor 
reproche, to counsell with a Phisition 
in such matters. For verely I 
saye (to conclude in fewe wordes) 
that no man, be he surgion or poticarie, 
shall neuer worke well without 
a true methode and learninge. 
For loke what thinge so euer he 
taketh in hande, what cure so euer 
he hath: he beyng destitute of learninge, 
shall neuer bringe it well to 
passe, without the ayde, helpe and 
counsell of the learned Phisition: 
for if he chaunce to do any notable 
cure, it shall be peraduenture more 
by happe hasard, then by procurement 
[^f.F2v^] 
and diligence. Here I coulde 
bring in many other abuses of surgerie: 
as howe some pretende and 
exercise phisicke (to their shame, deceauynge 
the people) vnder the 
cloke of Surgerie: some dryue of 
and linger out the time, to haue the 
more money. Some be so presumptuous, 
that wil warrant euery pacient: 
when oftentymes many by 
their negligence (and for lacke of a 
good diet, or some other good medecines 
whiche shoulde be appointed 
by the phisition) dye vpon their 
hands. Some whe~ they haue done 
al that they can, & see that their pacient 
begin to go to wrack, the~ immediatly 
with all spede, they will 
run to y=e= phisition w=t= their pacientes 
water, and then to aske counsayle 
when it is to late: and all because 
they wylle shake of the burdeyne 
[^f.F3r^] 
from theyr owne shoulders, to cast 
it vpon the Physitions necke, and 
to put all the faulte in hym, if any 
thyng chance otherwise then well: 
that so they may be cleane discharged 
and vnburdened from all maner 
of blame and reproche. Some 
go frome towne to towne, frome 
market to markette, to vtter their 
tromperie (theyr ware I woulde 
haue sayde) and to shew their cunnyng 
among the homely and simple 
people of the countrey. 
 
But all these wily and deceatful 
fashions are not yet throughly knowen, 
nor can neuer well be, vntyll 
suche tyme as a reformation bee 
made by some law or statute, whiche 
I pray God to graunt shortely, 
to his glory, & the Queenes maiesties 
honor, & the profite of we her 
subiectes & common weale. Amen.
