[^f.B4r^] 
[}Of the four Cardinall winds, together with 
their effects in breeding or bringing 
Sicknesse.}] 
 
THe East wind called Subsolanus, breedeth 
in cholerick bodies, sharp feavours, raging 
madnesse & perilous Apostumations in winter 
it is ever cold it bloweth seldome in the night, 
and this one thing is proper to it that [^ORIG. BLURRED^] doe 
chance to bring raine, it continueth a whole day 
together. 
 
The South wind called Auster, is of nature 
hot, and moist it breedeth corrupt humours and 
in hot bodies cramps giddinesse in th head, or 
the falling sicknesse, pestilence and cruell fevers 
 
The West-wind called Eaponius, is of nature 
cold, & moist, it breedeth Phlegme in moist bodies 
it procureth sleep, breedeth Apoplexies and the 
like, In the spring it greatly refresheth all, 
things brings abroad the blood, and the sound 
humours which lay his winter, much refreshing 
the mind. Howbeit near the end of Autumn 
when winter beginneth to approach if then 
growes churlish both on the sea and land. 
 
The North wind called Sept_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ntrio, is of nature 
cold and it is good against the Pestilence 
and yet in cold bodies it breedeth Plurisies, 
coughs, gouts, & in some squinancies: yet of all 
Winds it is held to be wholsomest although it 
be the sharpest in our winter months. 
 
[^f.B4v^] 
Note that what is spoken thus of their effects, 
meant of their long standing in the said quarters 
Know also that a continuall still Summer, is a 
sign of Plague or Earthquake. 
 
[}Of Blood-letting and some other Phisicall 
Observations.}] 
 
IN youth, let blood from the change to the 
first quarter. 
 
In middle age from the first quarter to the ful. 
 
In elder years from the ful to the last quarter. 
 
And in old age from the last quar. to the change. 
 
But know, that under the age of 14 and above 
56. is not good to bleed at all. 
 
Againe in the Canicular or Dog-dayes, it is 
very hurtfull to take any Phisicke, unlesse there 
be great need: and indeed necessity hath no law, 
Wherefore in such a case, the disease being desperate, 
the cure must be adventured. 
 
Take a purgation when the moon is in Trine 
or Sextile aspect with Venus, decreasing in any 
of these three signs, Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, & 
it wil be sure to worke the better because when 
a moist planet in a moist signe hath such an 
aspect the humours in the body are then stirred 
up, and downe, and so the better purged out. 
Wherefore in this case it cannot be amisse to 
prepare humors by something or other which 
[^f.B5r^] 
is laxative: and let this be whilest the Moon is 
either in Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius. 
 
Take a vomit that it may work throughly, 
when the Moon is in Aries, Taurus, or Capricorn. 
And know that the aspects of the Moon in Saturn, 
or Mars, or the Moon in Leo, ought to be eschewed 
in the taking of medicines. Finally, if 
necessity urge no hast, these observations are expedient, 
for it is a plain truth that the change 
of weather upon differing Aspects, doth greatly 
change and alter our bodies. 
 
[}Things good for the eyes.}] 
 
ALL green colours, cold water, Fenel, the 
water of white roses distilled, Celendine, 
eyebright, Uervine, Agrimony, Cloves: and for 
hot eyes the juice of Housleek softly boyled in 
the shell of a new laid Egge, till it be cleane 
scummed is very good. 
 
[}Things ill for the eyes,}] 
 
TO looke much at red colours, or at fire, to 
read soon after supper, to eat Garlick, Onyone, 
Radishroots saltmeats, coleworts, and pulse, 
as also to drinke Wine that is both thicke and 
sweet. Smoke likewise and dust be very bad: and 
to annoint the eyes with Bats blood wil clean 
put them out: according to that old proverb, 
The blood of a Bat will make a man see as wel 
by night as by day: which may well be true in 
him that cannot see at all. 
 
[^f.B5v^] 
[}Things good for the Brain.}] 
 
TO smell to Camomill, Musk, or red-roses: 
to wash the temples often with rose-water, 
to eat Sage measurably, to drink wine not overmuch, 
to keep the body warme, to wash the 
hands often to walke and sleepe measurably, to 
eat Mustard and Pepper, and not to be troubled 
with too much noise. 
 
[}Things ill for the Brain,}] 
 
LAte suppers much sleep after meat, anger, to 
smell to a white Rose, garlick onyons, much 
milke and cheese, to stand long against your use 
bare headed, to eat hastily, and overmuch to eat 
too liberally on any kinds of brains, much sweat 
in labour or travell, and a besotted practice or 
dayly course in drinking.
