[^Extract 1, ff. A3r-D2v^] 
 
[^f.A3r^] 
[}Orders thought 
meete by her Maiestie and her priuie 
Councel, to be executed throughout the Counties 
of this Realme, in such Townes, Villages, and other 
places, as are, or may be hereafter infected 
with the plague, for the stay of further 
increase of the same.}] 
 
[/1./] 
INprimis, all the Iustices in euery 
Countie, aswell within the liberties 
as without, immediatly vpon knowledge 
to them giuen, shall assemble 
themselues together at some one generall 
place accustomed, being cleare from infection 
of the plague, to consult howe these orders following 
may be duely put in execution, not meaning 
that any Iustices dwelling in or nere places infected, 
shall come thither whiles their comming may 
be doubtful. And after their first generall assembly, 
they shal make a distribution of themselues to sundry 
limits and diuisions, as in other common seruices 
for the Countie they are accustomed to doe for 
the prosecution thereof. 
 
[/2./] 
2 First, they shall inquire, and presently informe 
themselues by all good meanes, what Townes 
and Uillages are at the time of such assemblie infected 
within euery their Counties, and in what 
Hundred or other diuision, the said Townes & Uillages 
are, and howe many of the same places so infected 
are corporat Townes, market Townes and 
Uillages, and shall consider of what wealth the inhabitants 
[^f.A3v^] 
of the same Townes and Parishes are, 
to be hable to relieue the poore that are or shalbe infected, 
and to be restrained in their houses. 
 
[/3./] 
3 Item, thereupon after conference vsed according 
to the necessitie of the cause, they shall deuise 
and make a generall taxation, eyther by charging 
the Towne infected with one summe in grosse, or 
by charging the speciall persons of wealth within 
the same, to be forthwith collected for the rate of one 
moneth at the first, and so if the sicknesse shall continue, 
the collection of the like summe, or of more or of 
lesse, as time and cause shall require, and the same 
to be euery first, seconde, third, or fourth weeke emploied 
to and for the execution of the saide orders. 
And in case some of the said Townes infected shall 
manifestly appeare not to be of sufficient habilitie 
to contribute sufficient for the charges requisite, 
then the taxation or collection shalbe made or further 
extended to other partes, or in any other further 
limittes, as by them shalbe thought requisite 
where there shalbe any such Townes or Uillages 
so infected, and vnable to relieue themselues. And 
if the said Townes be scituated in the borders and 
confines of any other shire, then as the Iustices 
shal see cause and neede for the greatnesse of the 
charge requisite, that the partes of the Shire ioyning 
to the Townes infected be not hable, they shal 
write their letters to the next Iustices of the other 
Shire so confining, to procure by collection some 
reliefe, as in like cases they are to relieue them, in 
respect of neere neighbourhood of the place, and for 
that the same infection may be the better stayed 
from the said adioyning places, though they be separated 
[^f.A4r^] 
by name of the Countie. 
 
[/4./] 
4 Item, they shal cause to be appointed in euery 
Parish aswell infected as not infected, certaine 
persons to viewe the bodies of all such as shall die, 
before they be suffered to be buried, and to certifie 
the Minister of the Church and Churchwarden, or 
other principal officers, or their substitutes, of what 
probable disease the said persons died: and the saide 
viewers to haue weekely some allowance, and the 
more large allowance where the Townes or Parishes 
be infected, during the infection, towards 
their maintenance, to the end they which shal be in 
places infected, may forbeare to resort into the companie 
of others that are founde: and those persons 
to be sworne to make true report according to their 
knowledge, and the choise of them to be made by 
direction of the Curat of the Church, with three or 
foure substantiall men of the Parish. And in case 
the said viewers either through fauour or corruption, 
shal giue wrong certificat, or shal refuse to serue 
being thereto appointed, then to cause them to be 
punished by imprisonme~t, in such sort as may serue 
for a terror to others. 
 
[/5./] 
5 Item, the houses of such persons out of the 
which there shall dye any of the plague, being so 
certified by the viewers, or otherwise knowen, or 
where it shalbe vnderstood, that any person remaineth 
sicke of the plague, to be closed vpon all parts 
during the time of restraint, vz. sixe weekes, after 
the sicknesse be ceased in the same house, in case the 
said houses so infected shalbe within any Towne 
hauing houses neere adioyning to the same. And if 
[^f.A4v^] 
the infection happen in houses dispersed in Uillages, 
and separated from other houses, and that of 
necessitie, for the seruing of their cattel, and manuring 
of their ground, the said persons cannot continue 
in their houses, then they to be neuerthelesse restrained 
from resorting into companie of others, either 
publiquely or priuately during the said time of 
restraint, and to weare some marke in their vppermost 
garments, or beare white rods in their hands 
at such time as they shall goe abroade, and if there 
be any doubt that the masters and owners of the 
houses infected, will not duely obserue the directions 
of shutting vp their doores, specially in the 
night, then shall there be appointed two or three 
watchmen by turnes, which shalbe sworne to attend 
and watch the house, and to apprehend any 
person that shall come out of the house contrary to 
order, and the same persons by order of the Iustices, 
shal be a competent time imprisoned in y=e= stocks 
in the highway next to the house infected: and furthermore, 
some speciall marke shalbe made and fixed 
to the doores of euery of the infected houses, and 
where any such houses shall be Innes or Alehouses, 
the signes shalbe taken down for the time of the 
restraint, and some crosse or other marke set vp in 
the place thereof, to be a token of the sicknesse. 
 
[/6./] 
6 Item, they shall haue good regarde to chuse 
honest persons that either shall collect the summes 
assessed, or shall haue the custodie thereof, & out of 
the said collection to allot a weekely proportion for 
the finding of victuall, or fire, or medicines for the 
poorer sort, during the tyme of their restraynt. And 
whereas some persons being well disposed to yeeld 
[^f.B1r^] 
almes and reliefe, wil be more willing to giue some 
portions of victuall, as corne, bread or other meate, 
the same shall be committed to the charge of some 
speciall persons, that will honestly and truely preserue 
the same, to be distributed as they shall be appoynted 
for the poore that are infected. 
 
[/7./] 
7 Item, to appoynt certaine persons dwelling 
within the townes infected, to prouide and deliuer 
all necessaries of victuals, or any matter of watching 
or other attendance, to keepe such as are of 
good wealth being restrained, at their owne proper 
charges, and the poore at the common charges: and 
the said persons so appoynted to be ordered, not to 
resort to any publique assemblie during the tyme of 
such their attendance, as also to weare some marke 
on their vpper garment, or to beare a white rod in 
their hande, to the ende others may auoyde their 
companie. 
 
[/8./] 
8 Item, that in the shire towne in euery Countie, 
and in other great townes meete for that purpose, 
there may be prouision bespoken and made, of 
such preseruatiues & other remedies, which otherwise 
in meaner townes can not be readily had, as 
by the Physicians shall be prescribed, and it at this 
present reduced into an Aduise made by the Physicians, 
and nowe printed and sent with the sayd orders, 
which may be fixed in market places, vpon 
places vsual for such publique matters, and in other 
townes in the bodies of the parishe churches, and 
chappells, in which aduise only such things are prescribed, 
as vsually are to be had and founde in all 
countries without great charge or cost. 
 
[^f.B1v^] 
[/9./] 
9 Item, the Ministers and Curates, and the 
Churchwardens in euery Parish, shall in writing 
certifie weekely to some of the Iustices, residing 
within y=e= Hundred or other limit where they serue, 
the number of such persons as are infected and doe 
not die, and also of all such as shall die within their 
Parishes, and their diseases probable wherof they 
dyed, and the same to be certified to the rest of the 
Iustices at their assemblies, which during some 
conuenient time would be euery xxi. dayes, and 
thereof a particular booke kept by the Clerke of the 
peace, or some such like. 
 
[/10./] 
10 Item, to appoynt some place apart in each 
parish for the burial of such persons as shal die of the 
plague, as also to giue order that they be buryed after 
sunne setting, and yet neuerthelesse by daylight, 
so as the Curate be present for the obseruation of the 
rites and ceremonies prescribed by the lawe, foreseeing 
as much as conueniently he may, to be dista~t 
from the danger of infection of the person dead, or 
of the companie that shall bryng the corse to the 
graue. 
 
[/11./] 
11 Item, the Iustices of the whole Countie to 
assemble once in xxi. dayes, to examine whether 
those orders be duely executed, and to certifie to the 
lordes of the priuie Councell their proceedings in 
that behalf, what townes and villages be infected, 
as also the nombers of the dead, and the diseases 
wherof they dyed, and what summes of money are 
taxed and collected to this purpose, and howe the 
same are distributed. 
 
[/12./] 
12 Item, the Iustices in the hundred, where any 
[^f.B2r^] 
such infection is, or the Iustices next adioyning 
therunto, to assemble once a week, to take accompt 
of the execution of the said orders, and as they finde 
any lack or disorder, either to reforme it themselues, 
or to report it at the generall assemblie there, to be 
by a more common consent reformed. 
 
[/13./] 
13 Item, for that the contagion of the plague 
groweth and increaseth no way more, then by the 
vse and handling of such clothes, bedding and other 
stuffe as hath bene worne and occupyed by the infected 
of this disease, during the time of their 
disease: the sayde Iustices shall in the places infected 
take such order, that all the saide clothes 
and other stuffe, so occupied by the diseased, so 
soone as the parties diseased of the plague are all of 
them either well recouered or dead, be either burnt 
and cleane consumed with fire: or els ayred in such 
sort as is prescribed in an especiall article conteyned 
in the Aduise set downe by the Physicians. And for 
that peraduenture the losse of such apparell, bedding 
and other stuffe to be burnt, may be greater 
then the poore estate of the owners of the same may 
well beare: it is thought very good and expedient, 
if it be thought meete it should be burnt, that then 
the said Iustices, out of such collections as are to be 
made within their Counties for the reliefe of the 
poorer sort that be infected, allowe also to them such 
summe or summes as to them shall be thought reasonable, 
in recompe~ce of the losse of their said stuffe. 
 
[/14./] 
14 Item, the said Iustices may put in execution 
any other orders that by them at their generall 
assemblie shall be deuised and thought meete, tending 
[^f.B2v^] 
to the preseruation of her Maiesties subiectes 
from the infection, and to the end their care and diligence 
may the better appeare, they shall certifie in 
writing the sayde orders newly deuised, and if any 
shall wilfully breake and contemne the same or any 
the orders herein specified, they shal either presently 
punishe them by imprisonment, or if the persons so 
contemning them, shall be of such countenance as 
the Iustices shall thinke meete to haue their faults 
knowen to her Maiestie, or to the Councell, they 
shall charge and binde them to appeare before vs, & 
the contempt duely certified, that there may bee a 
more notorious sharpe example made by punishment 
of the same by order of her Maiestie. 
 
[/15./] 
15 Item, if there be lacke of Iustices in some 
partes of the shire, or if they which are Iustices 
there shall be for the tyme absent, in that case the 
more nomber of the Iustices at their assemblie shal 
make choyse of some conuenient persons to supply 
those places for the better execution hereof. 
 
[/16./] 
16 Item, if there be any person Ecclesiastical or 
laye, that shall holde and publishe any opinions (as 
in some places report is made) that it is a vayne 
thing to forbeare to resort to the infected, or that it 
is not charitable to forbid the same, pretending that 
no person shall dye but at their tyme prefixed, such 
persons shalbe not onely reprehended, but by order 
of the Bishop, if they be ecclesiasticall, shalbe forbidden 
to preache, and being laye, shalbe also enioyned 
to forbeare to vtter such dangerous opinions vpon 
payne of imprisonment, which shall be executed, if 
they shall perseuer in that error. And yet it shall appeare 
[^f.B3r^] 
manifestly by these orders, that according to 
Christian charitie, no persons of the meanest degree 
shalbe left without succour and reliefe. 
 
[/17./] 
17 And of these things aboue mencioned, the 
Iustices shall take great care, as of a matter specially 
directed & commanded by her Maiestie vpon 
the princely and naturall care shee hath conceyued 
towards the preseruation of her subiectes, who by 
very disorder, and for lacke of direction do in many 
partes wilfully procure the increase of this general 
contagion. 
 
[^f.B4r^] 
[}An aduise set dovvne 
vpon her Maiesties expresse commandement, 
by the best learned in Physicke within this 
Realme, contayning sundry good rules and easie medicines, 
vvithout charge to the meaner sort of people, 
as well for the preseruation of her good Subiectes 
from the plague before infection, 
as for the curing and ordring of 
them after they shal be 
infected.}] 
 
[}Preseruatiue by correcting the aire 
in Houses.}] 
 
[/18./] 
TAke Rosemarie dried, or Iuniper, 
Bayleaues, or Frankincense, 
cast the same on a Chafindish, 
and receiue the fume or smoke 
therof: Some aduise to be added 
Lauender, or Sage. 
Also to make fires rather in 
Pannes, to remoue about the 
Chamber, then in Chimneis, shall better correct 
the aire of the Houses. 
 
Take a quantitie of Vineger very strong, and 
put to it some small quantitie of Rosewater, tenne 
branches of Rosemarie, put them all into a basen, 
then take fiue or sixe Flintstones, heated in the fire 
till they be burning hotte, cast them into the same 
Vineger, & so let the fumes be receiued from place 
to place of your house. 
 
[^f.B4v^] 
[}Perfuming of Apparel.}] 
 
SUch apparel as you shal commonly weare, let 
it be very cleane, and perfume it often eyther 
with some red Sau~ders burned, or with Iuniper. 
And if any shal happen to be with them that are 
visited, let such persons as soone as they shal come 
home, shift themselues, & aire their other clothes, 
in open aire for a time. 
 
[}Preseruation by way of defence in open 
aire, and common assemblies to 
be vsed outwardly.}] 
 
IT is good in going abroade into the open aire 
in the streetes, to hold some things of sweete sauour 
in their hands, or in the corner of a handkercheife, 
as a sponge dipped in Vineger & Rosewater 
mixed, or in Vineger, wherein Wormewood, or 
Rue called also Herbegrace, hath bene boyled. 
 
[}Preseruatiue by way of inward 
medicine.}] 
 
TAke a quantitie of Rue, or Wormewood, or of 
both, and put it into a potte of vsuall drinke, 
close stopped, let it lie so in steepe a whole 
night, and drinke thereof in the morning fasting. 
 
In all Sommer plagues, it shalbe good to vse 
Sorrel sauce to be eaten in y=e= morning with bread, 
And in the fall of the leafe to vse the iuice of Barberies 
with bread also. 
 
[^f.C1r^] 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
Mens bodies 
are apt to take 
infectio~, either 
	By the constitution of the heart, 
	the vitall spirites being weake, 
	and the naturall heate feeble, in 
	which case thinges Cordiall are 
	to be vsed. 
	By repletion, 
	the body being 
	filled with humors, 
	either 
		Good, and then

		Euill, and then 
		is hee to be cured 
		with medicine 
		purgatiue. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
[}Preseruatiues Cordialls.}] 
[}Mithridates Medicine.}] 
 
TAke of good Figges not wormeaten, cleane 
wasshed, of Walnuts y=e= kernels cleane picked, 
of either of them an hundred, of the leaues of 
greene Rue, otherwise called Herbgrace, y=e= weight 
of ii. s. of common Salt the weight of iiii. d. cut 
the Figges in pieces, and stampe them and the 
Walnut kernels together in a morter of Marble 
or wood a good space, vntil they be very smal, and 
then put your Rue leaues vnto them, stampe and 
stirre them well together with the rest, last put in 
the Salt and stampe and stirre these things together, 
vntill they be encorporated and made of one 
substance. Of the which take the quantitie of ii. or 
iii. Figges euery morning fasting, to children the 
halfe wil serue, and he that listeth to increase or diminish 
[^f.C1v^] 
the substance of this Medicine, shall easely 
do it, by taking of a greater or lesse quantitie of the 
simples according to a due proportion. 
 
[}A well approued Medicine to 
preserue.}] 
 
TAke of the finest cleare Aloes you can buy, in 
colour like to a Liuer, and therefore called 
Hepatica, of Cinamo~, of Myrrhe, of ech of these 
the weight of iii. French crownes, or of xxii. d. of 
our money, of Cloues, Maces, Lignum Aloes, of Masticke, 
of Bole Oriental, of ech of these half an ounce: 
mingle them together and beate them into a very 
fine powder. Of the which take euery morning 
fasting the weight of a grote of this in white wine 
delayed with water, and by the grace of God you 
shall be safe from the plague. No man which is 
learned, if he examine the simples of this medicine 
whereof it consisteth, and the nature and power of 
them, can denie but that it is a medicine of great 
efficacie against the plague, and the simples wherof 
it is made, are easily to be had in any good Apothecaries 
shoppe, except Bole Orientall, which is 
vsed in the stead of true Bolus Armenus, wherof we 
haue seene great store in the shopps of master Rich 
the Queenes Maiesties Apothecarie, and master 
Morgans in Cheapsyde. 
 
Take a drie Figge and open it, and put the kernel 
of a Walnut into the same being cut very smal, 
iii. or iiii. leaues of Rue co~monly called Herbgrace, a 
corne of Salt, then rost the Figge & eate it warme, 
fast iii. or iiii. houres after it, and vse this twyse in 
the weeke. 
 
[^f.C2r^] 
Take the powder of Turmentill, the weight of 
vi. d. with Sorrell or Scabious water in Sommer, 
and in Winter with the water of Valerian or common 
drinke. 
 
Or els in one day they may take a litle Wormewood, 
and Valerian with a graine of Salt. In another 
day they may take vii. or viii. berries of Iuniper, 
dried and put in powder, and taking the same 
with common drinke, or with drinke in which 
Wormwood and Rue hath bene steeped al y=e= night. 
 
Also y=e= triakle called Diatesserou~, which is made 
but of iiii. things of light price easie to be had. 
 
Also the roote of Enula Campana, either taken in 
powder with drinke, or hanged about the brest. 
 
Likewise a piece of Arras roote kept in y=e= mouth 
as men passe in the streetes, is very good Cordiall. 
 
Take vi. leaues of Sorrell, wash them with water 
and vineger, let them lye to steepe in the said 
water and vineger a while, then eat them fasting, 
and keepe in your mouth and chewe nowe or then 
either Setwall, or the roote of Angelica, or a litle 
Cinamon. 
 
Take the roote of Enula Campana being layde 
and steeped in vineger, & grosse beaten, put a litle 
of it in a handkercheife, and smel to it if you resort 
to any that is infected. 
 
[}For women with childe, or such as be delicate 
and tender, and cannot away with 
taking of medicines.}] 
 
MAke a tost of white or of the second bread, as 
you thinke good, and sprinkle on it being 
hotte a litle good wine vineger, made with 
[^f.C2v^] 
Rose leaues, and for want of it any good common 
or vsed vineger, & spreade on the tost a litle butter, 
and cast thereon a litle powder of Cinamon, and 
eate it in the morning fasting. The poore which 
can not get vineger nor buy Cinamon, maye eate 
bread and Butter alone, for Butter is not onely a 
preseruatiue against the plague, but against all 
maner of poysons. 
 
When one must come into the place where infectious 
persons are, it is good to smel to the roote 
of Angelica, Gentian or Valerian, and to chewe any 
of these in his mouth. 
 
[}An other preseruatiue for 
the poore.}] 
 
IT shalbe good to take an handfull of Rue, and 
as much common Wormwood, and bruse them 
a litle: and put them into a potte of Earth or 
Tinne, with so much Uineger as shall couer the 
herbes: keepe this pot close couered or stopt, and 
when you feare any infection, dippe into this Uineger 
a piece of a sponge, and carie it in your hand 
and smell to it, or els put it into a round ball of 
Yuorie or Iuniper made ful of holes of the one side, 
carying it in your hand vse to smell thereunto, renewing 
it once in a day. 
 
[}To be vsed after infection taken.}] 
 
[/19./] 
FOr as much as the cause of the plague standeth 
rather in poyson, then in any putrifaction 
of humours as other agues doe, the chiefest 
[^f.C3r^] 
way is to moue sweatings, and to defend the 
heart by some cordiall thing. 
 
[}Suppositary.}] 
 
IF the Pacient be costiue and bound in his bodie, 
let him take a Suppositarie made with a litle 
boyled Honney, and a litle fine powder of Salt, 
and so taken in at the Fundament and kept till it 
mooue a stoole. 
 
[}An excellent Medicine made without 
charges.}] 
 
TAke of the powder of good Bayberries, the 
huske taken awaye from them, before 
they be dried, a spooneful: Let the Patient 
drincke this, well mingled in a draught of good 
stale Ale or Beere, which is neither sowre nor 
dead, or with a draught of White Wine, and go to 
bedde and cast himselfe into a sweat, and forbeare 
sleepe as is aforesaid. 
 
[}An other soueraigne remedie, that is 
a stilled water.}] 
 
TAke the inwarde barke of the Ashe tree, a 
pound, of Walnuts with the greene outward 
shelles, to the number of 50. cut these small, 
of Scabious, of Veruen, of Petimorel, of Howsleeke, of 
euery one a handfull, of Saffron halfe an ounce, 
powre vpon these y=e= strongest Uineger you can get 
foure pynts, let them a litle boyle together vpon a 
very soft fire, and then stand in a very close potte 
[^f.C3v^] 
well stopt all a night vpon the embers, afterward 
distill them with a soft fire, and receyue the water 
close kept. Giue vnto the Patient layd in bedde & 
wel couered with clothes, two ounces of this water 
to drink, & let him be prouoked to sweat, & euery 
sixe houres, during the space of xxiiii. houres, 
giue him the same quantitie to drinke. This Medicine 
for the worthines therof, and because it wil 
stand the maker thereof in little charge, it shall be 
very well done to distill it in the Sommer when 
the Walnutts hang greene on the tree, that it maye 
bee ready against the time that occasion serueth 
to vse it. 
 
[}1. Bloud letting.}] 
 
IF the Pacient be ful of humors which be good, 
let him immediatly be let bloud vpon the Lyuer 
veine in the right arme, or in the Median 
veine of the same arme (if no sore appeare) in the 
first day. 
 
[}2. Medicine purgatiue.}] 
 
FOr the poore take Aloes y=e= weight of vi. d. put 
in the pappe of an Apple: and for the richer 
Pilles of Rufus to be had in euery good Apothecaries 
shoppe. 
 
After letting of bloud and purging (as shall be 
needfull) some of the forenamed Cordials are to 
be vsed. 
 
These preparations thus vsed y=e= first day that 
the Pacient shall fall sicke, as cause shalbe to vse 
the one or the other (no sore appearing) in which 
[^f.C4r^] 
case if the sore shal appeare, they are both to be forborne, 
the next is to vse all meanes to expell the 
poyson, and to defend the heart by Cordials. 
 
[}3. Medicament expulsiue.}] 
 
THe poyson is expelled best by sweatings prouoked 
by posset Ale, made with Fenel & Marigolds 
in Winter, and with Sorrell, Buglosse 
and Borage in Sommer, with the which in both 
times they must mixe the triacle of Diatessaroum, 
the weight of ix. d. & so to lay them selues with all 
quietnes to sweat one halfe houre or an houre, if 
they be strong. For they that be neither full of humors 
nor corrupt in humors, neede neither purging 
nor letting of bloud, but at the first plunge 
maye moue themselues to sweat with Cordiall 
things mixt with such things as moue sweat, and 
are before declared. 
 
[}What is to be done when there is any 
rising or swelling in any part.}] 
 
THen if by these three meanes the poyson be 
expelled outward by Botches, carbuncles or 
markes, called Gods markes, according as 
nature doth expell, so must the further procedings 
be, prouiding still, that they continue still in the vse 
of the cordiall and moderate sweating now and 
then, al the time that the sores be in healing, which 
must by the Surgion be handled with great discretion. 
 
[^f.C4v^] 
[}Medicine to be vsed in ordinarie dyet.}] 
 
IT is thought that the powder of harts horne 
hath a speciall prerogatiue, to be vsed al the time 
of their sickenesse in their broths, and supping, 
which in Sommer must euer haue Sorrell, Borage, 
Buglosse, and in winter, Betony, and Scabious, or 
Morsus Diaboli, and if their habilities do not serue, 
let them vse it with Aleburies made with a litle 
Nutmegge, or one Cloue, or with Cawdelles in like 
maner made with Cloues, Maces, Nutmegges, Sanders 
or such like. 
 
[}Both to preserue and cure the 
sickenesse.}] 
 
TAke an egge & make a hole in the toppe of it, 
take out the white & yelke, fil the shel with the 
weight of two fre~ch crownes of Saffron, rost 
the said egge thus filled with Saffron vnder the 
embres, vntill the shell begin to waxe yelow, then 
take it from the fire, and beate the shel and Saffron 
in a morter together, with halfe a spoonefull of 
Mustard seede, take of this powder a french crown 
weight, and assoone as you suspect your self infected, 
dissolue it into tenne spoonfulles of posset ale, & 
drinke it luke warme, then go to bed and prouoke 
your selfe to sweating. 
 
[}To be vsed in the first time of 
the Sickenesse.}] 
 
ANother is to take fiue or sixe handefull of 
Sorrel, that groweth in the field, or a greater 
quantitie according as you will distill 
[^f.D1r^] 
more or lesse of the water thereof, and let it lye 
infrised or steeped in good Uineger the space of 
xxiiii. houres, then take it of & drie it with a linen 
cloth put into a Limbecke, and distill the water 
thereof: And assoone as you finde your selfe touched 
with the sickenesse, drinke foure spoonfulles 
of the sayde water with a litle sugar, and if you be 
hable, walke vpo~ it vntil you do sweat, if not, keep 
your bed, and being well couered, prouoke your 
selfe to sweating, and the next day to take asmuch 
againe of it a litle before supper. 
 
Item, to prouoke vomit with two ounces of 
rancke oyle, or walnutte oyle, a spoonefull of the 
iuyce of Celendyne, & halfe a spoonfull of the iuyce 
of radice roote, so that the party infected do walke 
and not sleepe, is better then any letting of blood, 
or any purging. For the disease neither can suffer 
agitatio~ of humors, nor when one is infected, hath 
no time to bleede or to purge. 
 
[}Outward medicines for to be applyed 
to the sore.}] 
 
[}The first.}] 
 
TAke of Scabiouse two handefulls, stampe it in 
a stone morter with a pestell of stone if you 
can get any such, then put vnto it of olde 
swynes grease salted, two ounces, and the yelke 
of an egge, stampe them well together, & lay parte 
of this warme to the sore. 
 
[^f.C1v^] 
[}The second.}] 
 
TAke of the leaues of Mallowes, of Camomill 
flowers, of eyther of them an handfull, of 
Lineseede beaten into pouder two ounces, 
boyle the Mallowe leaues first cut, and the flowers 
of the Camomil in faire water standing aboue a 
fingers breadth, boyle all them together vntil all 
the water almost be spent: then put thereunto the 
Lineseede, of Wheate flower halfe an handful, of 
swines grease the skins taken away iii. ounces, 
of oyle of Roses two ounces, stirre the~ still with a 
sticke, and let them all boyle together on a soft fire 
without smoke, vntill the water be vtterly spent, 
beate them all together in a morter, vntill they 
be wel encorporated together, & in feeling smooth, 
& not rough: then make part thereof hot in a dish 
set vpon a chafindish of coales, & lay it thicke vpo~ a 
linnen cloth applying it to the sore. 
 
[}Another excellent medicine to ripen and 
bring out the Sore.}] 
 
TAke a white Onion cut in pieces, of fresh 
butter three ounces, of Leuen the weight of 
twelue pence, of Mallowes one handfull, of 
Scabious if it may be had one handefull, of Cloues 
of garlicke the weight of xx. d. boyle them on the 
fyre in sufficient water, and make a pultesse of it, 
and lay it warme to the sore. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
TO the sore it selfe do thus. Take two handfull 
of Valerian, three rootes of Danewort, a 
handefull of Smalledge, or Louage, yf you can 
[^f.D2r^] 
get it, seethe them al in butter and water, & a fewe 
crommes of bread, and make a pultesse thereof, & 
lay it warme to the sore vntill it breake. 
 
[}Another for the same.}] 
 
IF you can not haue these herbes, it is good to 
laye a loafe of bread to it, hot as it commeth out 
of the ouen, (which afterward shal be burnt or 
buried in the earth) or the leaues of Scabious or 
Sorrell rosted, or two or three Lillie rootes rosted 
vnder embers, beaten and applied. 
 
[}A generall medicine for all sorts of people 
taken with the plague, to be had 
without cost.}] 
 
TAke of y=e= roote of butter burre, otherwise called 
pestile~t wort, one ounce, of y=e= root of great 
Valerian a quarter of an ounce, of Sorrel an 
ha~dful, boyle al these in a quart of water to a pint, 
then straine it and put thereto two spoonfulles of 
Vineger, two ounces of good Sugar, boyle all these 
together vntill they be wel mingled, let y=e= infected 
drinke of this so hotte as he may suffer it a good 
draught, and if he chaunce to cast it vp againe, let 
him take the same quantitie straight way vpon 
it, and prouoke himselfe to sweat, and he shal finde 
great helpe. 
 
[}Time of continuance apart from common 
assemblies.}] 
 
SUch as haue bene infected, should keepe their 
house without being conuersant with the 
whole, vntill the sores shall haue left running 
[^f.D2v^] 
and be perfectly whole and sound, which in sanguine 
& cholericke persons will be healed sooner, 
then in melancholike & flegmatike complexions. 
 
SUch persons may not wel be conuersant with 
them which are not infected, for the space of 
one moneth. 
 
[}Infected clothes.}] 
 
THe co~tagion suspected to remaine in clothes, 
either wollen or linnen, cannot wel be auoyded 
by better meanes, then by fire and water, 
by often washing & airing the same in frosts, 
and sunne shine, with good discretion, and burning 
the clothes of small value.
