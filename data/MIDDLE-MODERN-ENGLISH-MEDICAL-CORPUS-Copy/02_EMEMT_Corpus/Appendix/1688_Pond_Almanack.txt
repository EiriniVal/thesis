[}Prognosticks of Pestilential and unwholsom Years.}] 
 
IT is observed by the Learned, that those Years [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
Pestilential and unwholesom, when there are [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
numbers of Frogs, Flies, Locusts, &c. the reason [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
because those Creatures being ingendred of put_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ction, 
when they abound, shew a general disposi_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
of the Year, and constitution of the Air, to Disease 
of putrefaction: so likewise the same Prognostick_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], 
if you find Worms in Oak Apples; for the constitution 
of the Air, appeareth more subtilly, in any 
of these things, than to the sence of Man. 
 
Great and early Heats in the Spring (and namely 
in May) without Winds, portend also pestilent Years 
and generally so do years with little Wind or Thunder. 
 
Great Drought also in Summer, continuing till _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]wards 
the end of August, and some gentle Showers 
upon them, and then some dry weather again; do _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]tend 
a pestilent Summer the year following: [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
about the end of August, all the sweetness of the [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
which goeth into Plants and Trees, is exhaled [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
much more if August be dry) so that then [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
breath forth of the Earth, but a gross Vapor w_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
apt to corrupt the Air: and that Vapor by the [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
Showers, if they be gentle, is released, and co_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
forth abundantly: therefore they that come [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
soon after those Showers are commonly taken [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
Sickness. And in Africk, no body will stir out of [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
after the first Showers: but if the Showers come _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]mently, 
than they rather wash and fill the Earth, [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
give it leave to breath forth pleasantly. But if dry 
weather come again, than it fixeth and continueth the 
corruption of the Air, upon the first Showers begun, 
and maketh of it ill Influence, even to the next Summer, 
except a very frosty Winter discharge it, which 
seldom succeeds. 
 
[^f.C3r^] 
The lesser Infection of the Small Pox, Purple-Feavers, 
Agues, in the Summer precedent, and hovering 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] Winter, do likewise portend a great Pestilence in 
the Summer following; for putrefaction doth not rise 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] its height at once. 
 
A dry March, and a dry May, portend a wholesom 
summer, if there be a showring April between: but 
otherwise it is a sign of a pestilential Year. 
 
Furthermore, because the Air according to its situation 
doth much alter and change the Constitution of 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] body, and may breed pure and wholesom Bloud, 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] corrupt and bad Bloud, and malignant Humors. 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]erefore that you may know what Air is pure and 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^], and what air corrupt and infectious, we will 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] some Experiments, which the Judicious have ob_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ved, 
whereby you may conjecture how the Air is 
disposed; and that first, 
 
A sound anf pure Air is made hot presently after Sun 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^], and is made cold presently after Sun-setting. 
 
Which yieldeth a pleasant smell after Rain, clear 
and not evaporated, open and lightsom, where the 
North wind bloweth, and where the East wind blow_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
in the morning. 
 
A corrupt and infectious Air, is made by the often 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] of the South, or South-east-wind, or by the 
South-west, or West in the evening, which ingender 
Sicknesses. 
 
Where the Air is cold long after Sun-rising. 
 
Where the Air is long hot after Sun-set. 
 
Where the Air is long close, cloudy, or thick.
