God saue my gud Maister and 
Maistres, the barnes, and all 
this haly houshade, and shilde 
you from all doolle and shem, 
and sende you comforte of all 
thynges that you waud haue gud of: and 
God and our dere leddie, shilde and defend 
you from this Peste. Our father whiche 
art in heauen, hallowed bee your name, 
your kyngdome come, your willes bee doen 
in yearth as it is in heauen. & c. 
 
[}Ciuis.}] 
 
Me thinke I doe heare a good manerlie 
begger at the doore, and well brought vp, 
how reuerently he saieth his Pater noster, 
he thoues not GOD, but you hym, Gods 
blessing on his hart. I praie you wife, giue 
[^f.A5v^] 
the poore man some thing to his diner. 
 
[}Vxor.}] 
 
Sir, I will heare hym saie the Lordes 
praier better, before I giue him any thing. 
 
[}Ciuis.}] 
 
What a reconyng is this? Dame doe as 
I commaunde you, he is poore, wee haue 
plentie, he is verie poore and hongrie, therefore 
dispatche him a Gods name. 
 
[}Vxor.}] 
 
Soft fire maketh sweete Malte, he shall 
tary my leasure. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
Maistres, if you Ie angrie with the saiyng 
of my Pater noster in Englishe, I wil 
saie it in Latin, and also my Deprafundis. 
But so God helpe me, I doe not ken nene 
of them beth. 
 
[}Vxor.}] 
 
I thinke the same: soche Carpenter, soche 
thippes, your curate is some honest man I 
warraunt you, and taketh moche paine in 
feding his flocke, as seemeth by your learning. 
I praie you what cou~trie ma~ be you? 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
Sauyng youre honour gud Maistres, I 
was borne in Redesdale in Northumberlande, 
[^f.A6r^] 
and came of a wight riding sirname 
called the Robsons, gud honeste men and 
true, sauyng a little shiftyng for their liuyng, 
God helpe them sillie pure men. 
 
[}Vxor.}] 
 
What doest thou here in this countree, 
me thinke thou art a Scot by thy tongue. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
Trowe me neuer mare then gud deam, 
I had better bee hanged in a Withie of a 
Cowtaile, then be a rowfooted Scotte, for 
thei are euer fare and fase: I haue been a 
fellon sharpe manne on my handes in my 
yo~g daies, and brought many of the Scottes 
to grounde in the North Marches, and 
gaue them many greislie woundes, ne ma~ 
for man durst abide me luke I was so fell. 
Then the limer Scottes hared me, burnte 
my gudes, and made dedly feede with me, 
and my barnes, that now I haue nethyng 
but this sary bagge and this staffe, and the 
charitie of sike gud people as you are, gud 
maistres: ause I haue many of my sirname 
here in the citee, that wade thinke no shem 
on me, yea honeste handcraftie men. 
 
 [}Ciuis.}] 
 
How gote you in at the gates, my good 
[^f.A6v^] 
frende? 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
Deare sir, I haue many contrith men in 
this faire citee, that came of honest stocke 
in our lande, and some a little beyonde vs 
twentie or threttie lange miles, that can make 
pure shifte in the citee, and in the countree 
ause. I came in ne place but either the persone, 
Bailie, Conestable, or chief of the parishe 
is of our countrith borne: and some 
pure men as myne awne self God ken. Emong 
whem the Bedle of the beggers beyng 
a Ridesdale man borne, a gud manne 
and a true, whiche for ill will in his youth, 
did fleen the Countree, it was laied to his 
charge, the driuyng of Kine hem to his fathers 
byre: But Christe knaweth he was 
sackles, and liue as honestlie in his age, as 
his sire did whe~ he was yong, gud maister. 
 
[}Ciuis.}] 
 
I was borne in the Northe my felowe, 
and dooe liue here in this citee. I came hether 
when I was young, and when I was 
verie poore, but now I am in good case, to 
liue emong the reste of my neighbours. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
Goddess benison on you, and our deare 
[^f.A7r^] 
ladies, I came hether purely in mine age, 
I haue nethyng but wedom. 
 
[}Vxor.}] 
 
Geue God onely thankes, for so is his 
holie will and commaundementes, that 
wee should call vpon hym in the daies of 
trouble, and onely honour hym: wee haue 
no commaundement to honour our ladie. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
I think one woman wade take an other 
womannes part, doe as it shall please you 
I am ne clerke, but an ingram ma~, of smal 
cideracion in suche arogant buke farles. 
 
 [}Ciuis.}] 
 
What newes in the Countree, as you 
come by the waie? Countree man. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
Nene, but aude maners, faire saiynges, 
fase hartes, and ne deuotion, God amende 
the Markette, moche toilyng for the purse, 
decieuyng of eche other: in the Countree, 
strief, debate, runnyng for euery trifle to 
the Lawiers, hauyng nething but the nutshelles, 
the Lawiers eate the Carnelles, 
ause moche reising of re~tes, causyng greate 
dearthe, mucle pouertee. God helpe, God 
helpe, the warde is sare chaunged: extorcioners, 
[^f.A7v^] 
couetous men and hypocrites dooe 
mucle preuaile, God cut them shorter, for 
thei doe make a blacke warlde, euen helle 
vppon yearth, I thinke the greate fende or 
his deam will wearie theim all, nene other 
newes I ken, but that I did see micle prouidence 
made in the countree for you in the 
citee, whiche doe feare the Pestile~ce. I met 
with wagons, cartes, and horses full lade~ 
with young barnes, for fear of the blacke 
Pestilence, with their boxes of medicines, 
and swete perfumes. O God, how fast did 
thei runne by hundredes, and wer afraied 
of eche other, for feare of smittyng. 
 
[}Ciuis.}] 
 
I haue some of my children forthe, God 
sende them well to spede. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
Maister, why goe you not with theim 
your self? 
 
[}Ciuis.}] 
 
No, youth are apte to take the Plague, 
and furder, parentes are more naturall 
to their childre~, then children to their fathers 
and mothers. Nature doeth descende, but 
not ascende: also if the citeze~ should departe 
when the Plague doe come, then there 
[^f.A8r^] 
should not onely be no plague in the citee, 
but also the citee should be voide and emptie, 
for lacke of the inhabitours therein, 
therefore Gods will bee dooen emong his 
people. I doe not intende to flee, notwithsta~dyng 
I praie God of his mercie, deliuer 
vs from this Plague, for if it doe continue 
GOD knoweth, it will not onely take awaie 
a nomber of poore people, but many 
wealthie and lustie marchauntes also. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
If soche plague doe insue, it is no greate 
losse. For, first it shal not onely deliuer, the 
miserable poore man, woman and barne, 
from hurte and carefulnesse, into a better 
warlde: but ause cutte of many coueteous 
vsurers, whiche be like fat vncleane swine 
whiche doe neuer good, vntill thei come to 
the dishe, but wroote out euery plaute that 
thei can come by. And like vnto greate stinking 
mucle medin hilles, whiche neuer do 
pleasure vnto the lande or grounde, vntill 
their heapes are caste abrode to the profites 
of many, whiche are kepte neither to 
their awne comfortes, nor others, but enely 
in behadyng them: like vnto cruell dogges, 
liyng in a Maunger, neither eatyng 
[^f.A8v^] 
the Heye themselues, ne suffring the horse 
to feede thereof hymself. And in sike Plagues, 
wee pure people haue micle gud. 
Their losse is our gaine, when thei do become 
naked, wee then are clethed againste 
their willes: with their dooles and almose, 
we are relieued; their sicknes is our health 
their death our life. Besides vs Beggers, 
many mee menne haue gud lucke, as the 
Curate, Parishe clarke, and the bell man, 
often times the executours be ne losers by 
this game. And in fine, in my fantasie it 
is happie to the huntman, when he haue 
nethyng of the Catte but the sillie skinne. 
Wee beggers, couet not for the carcas of 
the dedde body, but doe defie it, we looke for 
aude caste cootes, dublettes, hose, cappes, 
beltes and shoes by their deathes, whiche 
in their liues thei waude not departe from, 
and this is our happe. 
 
[}Ciuis.}] 
 
Go thy waies to Antonius Mantuanus 
gates: For thither, euen within this twoo 
howers, I did see Maister Antonius Capistranus, 
solemnelie riding vpon his Mule, 
with a side goune, a greate chaine of golde 
aboute his necke, his Apothicarie Senior 
[^f.B1r^] 
Crispinus, a neighbours childe, borne here 
by in Barbarie, and his little Lackeye, a 
proper yong applesquier, called Pandarus, 
whiche carieth the keye of his cha~ber with 
hym. These are all gone in at the gates to 
that noble Italian: his aulmner this daie, 
bicause his maister was very sicke, applied 
the poore men with the purse, with moche 
deuotion for the time, being without hope 
of his Maisters recouerie. 
 
[}Mendicus.}] 
 
I praie God sende vs many sike praies, 
for it is merie with vs, when ene mannes 
hurte, doe turne to many mennes gaines: I 
will go thither, fare you well gud Maister. 
I wil drawe nere, and herke~ what maister 
doctour will saie, if I might be in place. 
 
[}Ciuis.}] 
 
Farewell, for thou doest not care which 
ende doe goe forwarde, so that thy tourne 
maie be serued. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
How dooe you good Maister Antonius? 
Lorde God how are you chaunged? How 
chaunceth this? What is the matter, that 
you looke so pale? You did sende for me by 
your seruaunt Iohannes de Corsica, a gentle 
[^f.B1v^] 
yong man, whiche lamented moche for 
you: when I heard it, with all spede I 
came from my other pacientes, of whom I 
thinke I haue taken myne vltimum vale. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
You are welcome Maister doctour with 
all my harte, now helpe at a pinche: or els 
neuer, for I doe feare my selfe verie moche. 
Oh my harte. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
I warraunt you man, let me feele your 
pulse, and then shall I procede to the cure, 
with Medicine and diete accordingly. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Take your pleasure good Maister Doctour, 
here is my hande: feele my pulse, and 
then you shall see myne vrine, and knowe 
the tyme of my sicknes. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
These are no very good tokens, neither 
in your vrine, pulse, stoole. &c. But I will 
doe the beste for you that I can doe by art. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
And then you shall wante no golde,for 
though I lacke helpe, yet I want no golde 
of euery coigne, and siluer also. My warehouses 
are well filled with wares of so~drie 
[^f.B2r^] 
kindes, whiche I doe sell vnto the retailers. 
Furder I haue wares of most auncient 
seruice, whiche owe me nothing, both 
in packes, vessels and chestes. & c. which are 
not fit for the retalers. The~ doe I kepe for 
shiftes, when any gentilmen, or long suter 
in the lawe, are behinde hande, and knowe 
not what to doe: then by good suretees, or 
assured landes by statute marchaunt. &c. I 
doe sometyme make .xxx. or .L. in the hundred 
by yere. I haue diuers soche honeste 
waies to liue vpon, through the wittie and 
secrete handlyng of my brokers here in the 
citee, and my factours, whiche are at Antwarpe. 
&c. By whom I doe vnderstand the 
state, and what co~moditie is beste. Furder 
I haue extended vpon auncient landes in 
the countrie, for the breche of couenauntes 
That to conclude with you maister doctor, 
I could neuer haue died in a worse tyme, 
my businesse is soche. I would of all thinges 
liue still, for here I doe knowe what I 
haue, and how I am vsed: but when I am 
gone, I doe not knowe what shall happen 
vnto me, nor who~ to trust with y~ whiche I 
haue gotten with trauell, and obtained by 
fortune. [}Medicus.}] 
 
[^f.B2v^] 
You doe speake like a wise man as euer 
I harde, and moste thynges that you haue 
taken in hande, haue greate profite with 
you: of my parte I would bee lothe to lose 
you, bothe for an vnfained loue that I doe 
beare vnto you for your wisedome, and also 
for your liberalitee and giftes geuen to 
me many a tyme. Lo, here is the Damaske 
goune yet in store. Here is also a Flagone 
chaine of the hundred Aungelles that you 
did geue me, in your last greate Feuer. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Who is able to resiste soche a multitude 
of Aungelles, I thinke fewe Doctours of 
Phisicke? But rather then I would dye, I 
will let flie a thousande more. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
That is the waie I assure you, to perfite 
health: and for that cause the Phisician 
was ordeined, as it is written. Honour the 
Phisician, with the honour that is due vnto 
hym, because of necessitie, for the Lorde 
haue created hym, and he shall receiue giftes 
of the kyng. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
That is a good swete text for Phisicians, 
but why doe you leaue out these woordes, 
[^f.B3r^] 
in the middes of the matter? Whiche is: of 
the moste higheste cometh learning, and so 
I doe reme~ber, I heard our curate reade in 
the churche, as by chaunce I came in with 
a Sargeant, to arest twoo Bankeroutes. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
What your curate pleased him to read, 
I care not, for I medle with no Scripture 
matters, but to serue my tourne: But I 
knowe that, whiche I haue saied, is written 
in the Bible. 
 
[}Antonius}] 
 
Bee all thynges written in the Bible 
true: I praie you tell me? 
 
[}Medicus}] 
 
God forbidde Maister Antonius, then it 
would make a fraie emong Marchauutes, 
for it is writte~. None shall enter into goddes 
dwellyng, or reste with hym vpon his 
Mountaine, that lendeth his money vpon 
vsurie, or to vsurie, whereby to hinder his 
neighbour: And this is nowe become the 
greatest trade. And many bee vndooen by 
borowyng, and fewe doe lose by lendyng, 
speciallie men of your worshipfull experience. 
And how like you this texte? 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
[^f.B3v^] 
Texte how they will texte, I will truste 
none of them all, saie what thei will: there 
bee many soche saiynges againste men, as 
the ten commaundementes. & c. Well, for 
my parte, I haue little to doe in these matters, 
Marie I would be glad to liue orderlie 
and Ciuillie, so that the worlde should 
not wonder at my doynges: but if dampnacion 
should arise, when the Scripture 
doe threaten it to men, then should wittie 
wordes in bargaining, with facing othes, 
and pleasaunt venerous table talke, with 
reuiling of our enemies. &c. bee accompted 
damnacion. Then I warrant you, helle is 
well furnished with courtiers, marchauntes, 
soldiours, housebandmen, and some 
of the cleargie, I warrant you also. Emong 
whom there are many more spitefull then 
Spiritualle, euen as there are emong the 
Phisicia~s many more coueteous then kind 
harted. I meane not you maister doctour. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Sir, I dooe knowe you dooe not. But so 
God helpe me, one thyng doeth moche reioyce 
my harte, in your communicacion. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What is that? 
 
[^f.B4r^] 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
I thinke that we two are of one religio~. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What is that I praie you? For I know 
not myne owne religion. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Commaunde your folkes to departe out 
of the chamber, and your yong scapes also 
whiche you haue gotten by chaunce medley, 
for wante of mariage: for the old prouerbe 
is, small Pitchers haue wide eares, 
and the fielde haue iyes, and the wood haue 
eares, therefore wee muste commen closelie, 
and beware of blabbes. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Well, nowe the doores are sparred, saie 
on your minde, of what Religion are you? 
Be plain with me man. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Herke in your eare sir, I am neither catholike, 
Papiste, nor Protestante, nor Annabaptiste, 
I assure you. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What then: you haue rehearsed choyse 
and ple~tie of religions. What doe you honour? 
the Sonne, the Moone, or the starres, 
Beast, Stone, or Foule, Fishe or Tree? 
 
[^f.B4v^] 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
No forsothe. I doe none of theim all. To 
be plain, I am a Nulla fidian, and there are 
many of our secte. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Oh. Qui dixit in corde suo non est deus. 
Well, we differ verie little is this poincte, 
but if I doe liue, we shall drawe nere to an 
vnitee: in the meane time, let your Pothicarie 
prouide some good thinges for the bodie. 
I praie you open the doore. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Maisters, I praie you call Crispinus hether 
into the Gallarie, and Leonardus de 
Montano with hym. 
 
[}Crispine}] 
 
What is your pleasure maister doctour? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
How doe you like this Garden? 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
There are ple~tie of goodly herbes, bothe 
clensing, healing, losing, binding, and restoring. 
I neuer did see more choise of sondrie 
kindes of strau~ge flowers, moste pleasaunt 
to the iye, and sweete also. The fine 
knottes are doen in good arte, Geometrically 
figured. A swete conduite in the middest, 
[^f.B5r^] 
made of fine stone, plentifully, casting 
forth water, like fine siluer streames many 
waies. In whiche condite, I did behold by 
the space of one houre a meruelous thing, 
the meaning thereof I knowe not. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
What is it Crispine? 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
The piller was eight foote square, and 
eightene foote high, with compartementes 
of connyng Masonrie, curiouslie couered 
with fine golde. Upon the toppe a Tyger 
fearefullie, hauing a yong child in his armes 
readie to kill it, the child had a croune 
of golde uppon his hedde. And in his lefte 
hande a Globe, figuring the whole worlde 
and was called Microcosmos, about whiche 
was written Globus conuersus est. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
This gentleman came of a greate house, 
this is the crest of his armes, for he descended 
of the most auncie~t Romaines I warrant 
you, he is no vpstrat, assure your self. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
I had thought it had rather signified the 
condicions of a cruell tiraunt, or some bloodie 
conquerour: which by vsurpacion gettyng 
[^f.B5v^] 
the victorie of any common wealthe, 
as Landes, Countrees or Citees, eftesones 
dooe spoile the true heires and owners 
of the lande, whiche doe weare the croune 
chaunge the state of the Commons to the 
worser parte, spoiling theim with sworde 
and bondage, whiche appered by these 
wordes: Globus conuersus est: the worlde 
is chaunged or tourned. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
A good obseruacion: what did you se then? 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
I did beholde on the other side the .ix. Muses, 
with straunge instrumentes of Musike 
sittyng vnder the hille Parnasus, and the 
Poetes sittyng under the grene trees, with 
Laurell garlandes, besette with Roses about 
their heddes, hauyng golden pennes 
in their handes, as Homer, Hesiodus, Ennius. 
&c. writing verses of sondrie kindes. 
And Lucanus saite there verie highe, nere 
vnto the Cloudes, appareilled in Purple: 
saiyng. 
 
Quantum sermotus ego 
Cardine Pernasus gemino petit ethera 
[^f.B6r^] 
colle. 
Motis Phœbo Bromioq~ sacer. 
 
And nere theim satte old Morall Goore, 
with pleasaunt penne in hande, commending 
honeste loue without luste, and pleasure 
without pride. Holinesse in the Clergie, 
no tirannie in rewlers, no falshode in 
Lawiers, no Vsurie in Marchauntes, no 
rebellion in the Commons, and vnitee emong 
kingdomes. &c. 
 
Skelton satte in the corner of a Piller 
with a froste bitten face, frowning, and is 
scante yet cleane cooled of the hotte burning 
cholour, kindled againste the cankered 
Cardinalle Wolsey: writing many a 
sharpe disticons,with bloodie pe~ne againste 
him, and sente theim by the infernalle riuers 
Styx Flegiton, and Acheron, by the 
Feriman of helle called Charon, to the said 
Cardinalle. 
 
How the Cardinall came of nought 
And his prelacie solde and bought, 
And where soche Prelates bee, 
Sprong of lowe degree: 
[^f.B6v^] 
And spirituall dignitee, 
Farewell benignitee, 
Farewell simplicitee, 
Farewell good charitee. 
 
Thus paruum literatus, 
Came from Rome gatus, 
Doctour dawpatus, 
Scante a bachelaratus. 
 
And thus Skelton did ende, 
With wolsey his frende. 
 
Wittie Chaucer sate in a chaire of gold 
couered with Roses, writyng Prose and 
Rime, accoumpanied with the spirites of 
many kinges, knightes, and faire ladies. 
Whom hee pleasauntlie besprinkeled with 
the sweete water of the welle, consecrated 
unto the Muses, ecleped Aganippe. And 
as his heauenlie spirite co~mended his dere 
Brigham, for the woorthie intombing of 
his bones, worthie of memorie, in the long 
sleping chamber, of moste famous kinges 
[^f.B7r^] 
Euen so in tragedie, he bewailed the sodaine 
resurreccion of many a noble man, 
before their time: in spoiling of Epitaphes 
whereby many haue loste their inheritau~ce 
&c. And furder thus he saied lamenting. 
 
Couetos menne dooe catche, all that 
thei maie haue, 
 
The fielde and the flocke, the toumbe 
and the graue: 
 
And as thei abuse riches, and their 
graues that are gone, 
 
The same measure thei shall haue euery 
one, 
 
Yet no buriall hurteth holie menne, 
though beastes them deuour, 
 
Nor riche graue preuaileth the wicked, 
for all yearthly power. 
 
Lamentyng Lidgate, lurkyng emong 
the Lilies, with a balde skons, with a garlande 
of Willowes about his pate: booted 
he was after Saincte Benettes guise, 
and a blacke Stamell robe, with a lothlie 
[^f.B7v^] 
monsterous hoode hanging backward, his 
stooping forwarde bewailing euery estate 
with the spirite of prouidence. Foreseyng 
the falles of wicked men, and the slipperie 
seates of Princes, the ebbyng and flowing 
the risyng and fallyng of men in aucthoritee, 
and how vertue doe aduaunce the simple, 
and vice ouerthrowe the mooste noble 
of the worlde. And thus he saied. 
 
Oh noble Princes conceiue and dooe 
lere, 
 
The fall of kynges for misgouernere, 
 
And prudently peisyng this matter, 
 
Vertue is stronger then either plate 
or maile: 
 
Therefore consider when wisdome 
dooe counsaile, 
 
Chief preseruatiue of Princelie magnificence, 
 
Is to almightie GOD to dooe due reuerence. 
 
Then Bartley with an hoopyng Russette 
[^f.B8r^] 
long coate, with a pretie hoode in his 
necke, and fine knottes vppon his girdle, 
after Fraunces trickes. He was borne beyonde 
the colde Riuer of Twede. He lodged 
vppon a sweete bedde of Chamomill, 
under the Sinamom tree: aboute him many 
Shepherdes and shepe, with pleasaunt 
pipes: greatlie abhorring the life of Courtiers, 
Citezens, Usurers, and Banckruptes. 
&c. whose old daies are miserable. And 
the estate of shepherdes and countree people, 
he compted moste happiest and sure. &c. 
Saying: 
 
VVho entreth the Courte in young & 
tender age. 
 
Are lightlie blinded with folie and 
outrage: 
 
But soche as entre with witte and 
grauitee: 
 
Bowe not so sone to soche enormitee: 
 
But or thei enter if thei haue learned 
nought, 
 
[^f.B8v^] 
Afterward is vertue the lest of their 
thought. 
 
Nexte theim in a blacke chaire of Gette 
stone, in a coate of armes satte an aunciente 
knight, in Orange Tawnie, as one 
forsaken, bearyng vpon his breast a white 
Lion, with a Croune of riche golde on his 
hedde: his name was sir Dauie Linse, vppon 
the mounte, with a hammer of strong 
steele in his hande, breakyng a sonder the 
counterfeicte crosse kaies of Rome, forged 
by Antichriste. And thus this good knight 
of Scotlande saied, to Englande the elder 
brother, and Scotlande the younger: 
 
Habitare fratres in vnum, 
Is a blesfull thyng, 
One God, one faith, one babtisme pure 
One lawe, one lande, and one kyng: 
Clappe handes together brethren dere 
Vnfained truce together make, 
And like frendes dooe euer accorde, 
But Frenche and Romaine doe firste 
[^f.C1r^] 
forsake, 
You are without the continent, 
A sole lande of auncient fame, 
Ab origine a people olde, 
Bolde Britaines ecleped by name, 
Sicut erat in principio: 
Graunt oh God it maie bee, 
In sæcula saeculorum, 
That we maie haue peace in thee, 
Then we shall feare no forein power, 
That againste vs shall aduaunce, 
The Tartre cruell, the curse of Rome 
Ne yet the power of Fraunce. &c. 
 
On the second square was a faire diall 
for this Orison, vnto whiche was added 
the howers of the planettes, vpon thesame 
was written in large letters of fine golde, 
Tempora labuntur. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
There stoppe and laie a Strawe. For 
Tempora labuntur, is to saie: by little and 
[^f.C1v^] 
little, time dooe slippe awaie. I will heare 
the reste of the matter at leasure. What is 
it a clocke? 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
But early daie, skant .viii. of the clocke. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Well I praie you, dispence all thinges 
in order Contra Pestem, in the same sorte, 
bothe noumber of the Simples, Dose and 
quantitee, euen as you did it yesterdaie, 
whiche was geuen to Paule. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
Sir, I haue spente all my fine Myrrhe, 
what shall I doe? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
You are a wise manne: put in Quid pro 
quo, called [^GREEK OMITTED^]. Hoc est simplicia 
que aliorum facultati similium penuria 
subponi possunt medici consilio. Intelligis? 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
Etiam domine doctor. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Moue te ocius, & quicquid agas prudenter 
agas. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
By God he shall paie for the malt grinding, 
[^f.C2v^] 
he haue enough, he know none ende 
of his pelfe, it will come to an euill ende. 
God sende me more soche cheates. What, 
me thinke I se twoo men in long gounes, 
with shorte beardes at the gates, what are 
they a Gods name? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
I knowe them verie well, thei are twoo 
pettifoggers in the Lawe, the one is called 
maister Auarus, a good gentleman, and of 
a greate house, a man of good conscience, in 
deede he is my cosen germaine, on my mothers 
side: Surelie he can geue good counsaile, 
and is fitte to be with soche a manne 
as maister Antonius is, in deede thei haue 
been long acquainted, and will neuer giue 
ouer vnto the ende. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
Who is the other on the lefte hande, he 
semeth to be a proper gentlemanne and a 
studious, he is leane, an handsome clenlie 
man. Me thinke he haue on eche side of his 
goune a bagge, and his handes in theim. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Euery man haue his grace and gesture: 
I promise you, I durste committe a greate 
secrete vnto him. Oh he is a peragon. 
 
[^f.C2v^] 
 [}Crispine.}] 
 
What meaneth he by winckyng like a 
Goose in the raine, and biting of his lippe. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Doe you note that? It is a good signe of 
[/1./] 
a constante man, marke it when you will, 
he is a wittie fellowe, and one that is in 
greate estimacion, fit for maister Antonius, 
his name is Ambodexter. Goe doune 
with spede, and saie you haue geuen maister 
Antonius his purgacion, and this daie 
he haue no leasure to speake with any ma~, 
and also how that he is amended: for, if 
the curate were here for the soule, wee for 
the bodie, & Auarus for the purse: here wer 
[/2./] 
but a madde company, we should neuer agree 
together, but fall into discordes. Dispatche 
them with spede, fare ye well. I wil 
goe and cause him to bee letten blood, and 
kepe him from slepe, then shall he bee purged 
to morowe in the morning. Bryng the 
pouder against the plague with you. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
GOD giue you good morowe gentille 
maister Auarus: what maister Ambodexter, 
how fare you bothe? maister Antonius 
did moche desire to haue spoken with you, 
[^f.C3r^] 
eight howers paste. In deede within this 
twoo houres, sauyng your worshippes, he 
hath taken a purgacion, whiche haue caste 
suche ayre abrode, that I was not hable to 
abide in the chamber, I had forgotten my 
perfumes, to make all well. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
What thinke you of hym, shall he escape 
or no? Who is with hym? I praie you 
tell me. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
None but Doctor Capistranus, whiche 
also desire your absence, because he haue 
hym in cure: and truste to make hym slepe 
after his lacke of rest, and to morowe take 
your pleasure with hym. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
Fare ye well: we haue drawen and ingrossed 
his bookes, commende vs to maister 
Doctour, it were a good pastyme, to 
take the foote clothe from his Mule, for .ii. 
or three hourers in pastyme. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
I had rather haue the Mule. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
What the deuill doeth this doctor here? 
If this purgyng wer not, we would clense 
[^f.C3v^] 
and expulse with our resettes, that whiche 
should serue our tourne well enough. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
I warraunt you the Doctour doe make 
worke for vs bothe: wee shall bryng our 
matters to passe in good time, take no care 
man for the matter, we will preuente the 
doctor to morowe, when he cometh hether 
with a presente, and bring him some pretie 
thinges, wherin he deliteth: we shall finde 
soche meanes to perswade with him by little 
and little, to be executors of his will according 
to his old promise. Further, he wil 
take it kindely, that we dooe claime kinred 
on hym by his mothers side, whiche was a 
kinde harted woman, and full of metrix, 
ha, ha, ha. She was in deede of those qualitees, 
her sonne is like the mother, as seemeth 
by one in the house 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
I feare that damosell will marre all together: 
she doeth rule the rost, she ware the 
keies. He ca~ neuer haue her out of his sight 
yet Reinold his man thinketh hymself, in 
more estimatio~ with her, then his maister. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
The last yere I counterfected a sickenes 
[^f.C4r^] 
of purpose, as I can when I lust, I framed 
my Phisicion to my phantasie, no manne 
thought that I should haue liued twoo dayes, 
when I was lone I laughed. You 
remember whom I made myne executor, 
euen Antonius Mantuanus, I then prouidentlie 
by three thynges, did foresee this 
tyme and cause. The first was, his greate 
surfeictes in banquetyng: the seconde, his 
watchyng at Chesse and Cardes, the third 
you knowe what. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
Well, well, be as maie is no ba~ning: 
I doe feare many thinges: First the medicines 
maie chaunce recouer him, then wee 
shall haue nothyng. Well, Reinolde and 
the damosel be euer in presence, and watch 
him: she cheares her maister with a louing 
countenaunce. Reinold saies, that he hath 
doen true seruice a long time. &c. Well, I 
smelle an other padde in the strawe: when 
all this is doen, the curate is a craftie Rhetorician, 
well can he perswade and reherse 
Gods vengeaunce, threates and plagues, 
by examples moste fearfull, like thonderboltes, 
describing the scalding hous of hel, 
ve, ve, ve, with the storie of Diues and Pauper, 
[^f.C4v^] 
and the daie of iudgement, reading the 
Homelie of death, crying out al is but vanitie, 
vanitie, and vexacion of minde, damnacion, 
except repentaunce, and true confession 
fro~ the harte, & restitucion of wronges, 
he will keepe a stire, and bring our cosin 
into a fooles paradise. It is he that will 
raise vp all the beggers in the toun: he wil 
crie, geue with your own hand, for to daie 
you are a man, to morowe yearth & ashes. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
First, let vs be sober, and seme to bee sorowfull 
[/3./] 
for him, desiring nothing but onely 
his life. If he stand in great daunger, the 
doctor shall haue his leaue, and tary no lo~ger 
with him, in who~ I thinke he haue no 
hope to recouer, let him be well rewarded. 
Secondly let Reinold be sent into the cou~tree, 
to the debtours for money: tell hym it 
shall tourne to his greate profite, and how 
his maister doeth inte~de to take him as his 
sonne, and will trust none but onely hym, 
to fetche the money in the cou~tree. Thirdly, 
I will seme to fantasie the minion, wishyng 
her to bee my wife, alledging what 
broken slepes she hath caused me to haue, 
and the cause of my commyng hether onely 
[^f.C5r^] 
for her staie. Then I will practise for the 
keies of the greate blacke cheste, and of the 
steele caskette. Fourthlie, maister Curate 
shalbe gently saluted with a Barnardes 
blowe, wee will commende him, wee will 
praie with him, and also receiue the Communion 
with our cosin, that he maie haue 
a good opinion in vs, and deliuer hym a 
bagge with fiue pound in pence to geue to 
the poore, in whose absence peraduenture 
our Scribe and wee shall frame the wille: 
how like you this practise? If this will not 
serue, I haue a shifte of descant in store, 
that I learned in Bosomes Inne. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
The Deuill take altogether, so that wee 
had the gold, practise this I praie you: you 
haue a good witte, by my troth I could not 
slepe all this night for this matter, if you 
were not, I could doe nothyng but stande 
like a shepe. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
I warrant you, I haue had long experience 
in this trade, euerywhere within this 
Realme, I can doe the like with the helpe 
of Auarus, whiche is a verie good penne 
man, close and honest, he writeth sonderie 
[^f.C5v^] 
handes, and is a liuely grauer of Seales 
[/4./] 
hymself, also is a kinde harted fellowe: for 
he will not sticke to lende his frend an othe 
if neede doe require. 
 
 [}Auarus.}] 
 
The worlde is full of starting holes, me~ 
maie skant knowe how to trust men now 
a daies, but for the good reporte that I doe 
heare of this honest felowe, I will bee glad 
to haue his acquaintau~ce. I knewe diuerse 
of his kinsmen .xx. yeres ago: GOD haue 
mercie of all Christen soules, it was then a 
mery worlde, and will neuer be so good againe, 
vntill this Gospellyng Preachers 
haue a sweating sickenes in Smithfieled, 
and their Bible burnte, well, would some 
wer at libertee for their sakes. Well, wel. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
Oh I doe remember that reuerent mortified 
father, that holy man bishop Boner, 
that blessed catholique confessor of Rome, 
if he were againe at libertee, he would not 
dallie to make the~, but trimly would roste 
these felowes, and after burne theim, you 
knowe his workmanship verie well. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
He is my cosin Germain, and Periurus 
[^f.C6r^] 
that honest felowe, was his boie, & brought 
vp with him in his youth, and your grau~dfather 
did penne his prologue, in the booke 
called De vera obedientia, when as thei 
laughed merely, saiyng thei had rather put 
[/5./] 
to their handes, then either their heddes or 
hartes, wise men, wise men. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
Yea, soche wisemenne will serue the 
tyme, Prudenter agere, and bee as wise as 
Serpentes, and simple as Doues. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
To haue the nature of a serpent, I will 
stande with them: but beshrowe my harte, 
if I would be as simple as a Doue, either 
so simple, fearfull, or doltishe, but rather as 
my good Lorde Boner. Quasi Leo rugiens 
quere~s quem deuoret. And thus he would 
expounde that texte, whiche muste haue 
soche a glose vpon it. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
I am lone vpon gloses, I haue arte in 
[/6./] 
store to sophist, I was brought vp .iii. yere 
with a Frier of mont Piller, he taught me 
how to ha~dle prosa, obscurum, inordinatu~, 
and barbarum, with genus and species: full 
wel I can ha~dle the matter, bothe pro and 
[^f.C6v^] 
contra. Commonlie these are my figures, 
and serue well to my purpose, as Enigma, 
proæmiæ, ironiæ, sarcasimus, antephrasis, & 
chatientismus. I have many rotten rules, 
whiche dooe serue for the purse: I learned 
theim at Paris, thei are written in an olde 
Barbarous Frenche booke. When wee 
are at more leasure, I will shewe thee all 
my cu~nyng, my gaines and profites. Now 
lette vs conferre bothe together, this afternoone 
about our matters. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
Conte~ted in that case, as for termes and 
trickes in Logike, I forse not of them, thei 
will paie for no horse bread: it is golde that 
[/7./] 
maketh a glad hart. He deserueth reuere~ce 
and rule, that hath it and kept it: go let vs 
dine together, and sende for our friendes, 
Rapax, Capax, and Tenax, to kepe vs companie 
an hower or twoo, for they are good 
felowes. 
 
[}Ambodexter.}] 
 
Agreed, I like their companie very well 
thei are my frendes, and kinde harted men. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
And mine also, go let vs depart, and not 
bee seen moche together abroade standyng 
[^f.C7r^] 
in counsaill, because our matters are not 
curraunte 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Crispinus, where haue you been so long? 
I thought it a yere since youre departure, 
but I haue shorted the tyme, in beholdyng 
this pitifull picture of Lucretia, and this 
fearfull siege of Pauie. But this Mappe of 
the discripcio~ of Terra Florida in America 
hath reioysed me, there the gold & precious 
stones, and Balmes are so plentifull, siluer 
and spice are nothing with them, no labor 
is in that land, lo~g life they haue: one thing 
there is, whiche liketh me not emong the~. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
What is that maister Doctor? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Thei haue neuer sickenesse vntill death 
doe come: therefore there is no goode dwellyng 
for vs in soche a lande. Further, it is 
saied, that they haue no debate nor strief in 
their common wealthes. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
Marie then it is as vnprofitable for Lawers, 
as for Phisicians. I truste wee shall 
neuer be in that case, in this our countree. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
[^f.C7v^] 
God defende vs from soche a Common 
wealthe, it would marre altogether. Now 
let vs go to the chamber doore, and se how 
the worlde goeth with maister Antonius, 
and take our Phlebothomer with vs, to 
let hym bloud. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
I will waite on your maistership. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
How doe you, good Maister Antonius, haue 
you taken any rest, since I was with you? 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
No more Maister Doctor, then if I had 
been laied on hote coales. Oh sir, ther was 
[/8./] 
neuer manne in soche a case, as I am in. I 
haue had moste fearfull dreames of theues 
to robbe me: me thought I was in the top 
of a high tower, tellyng of money, and sodainly 
there came an yearthquake, & shooke 
the tower in peces, & caste me doune vpon 
weapons all bloudy, whiche a great nomber 
of Morians had in their handes, from 
the~ I fell in the fire, whiche was like highe 
mou~taines about me, whereas was moche 
noise and a cruell battaill. I did see there 
many of myne old acquaintaunce, whiche 
sometyme were of greate honour, bothe 
[^f.C8r^] 
men Spiritualle and Temporall, and the 
Pope hymself, with many of his friendes. 
Thei were in extreme wretchednesse, and 
sore handled of fearful Monsters, and wormes 
gnawyng vpon their breastes, vppon 
whom was written: Conscience hath accused 
me, and hell deuoured me. Ve, ve, ve, 
[/9./] 
and thus I am tossed to and fro, alas what 
shall I doe. Also I did heare many ragged 
and sicke people, crie vengeaunce on me: 
and men in prison also, that said I had undoen 
them, to inriche my self, oh good God. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
Sir I praie you let me harke~ in your eare. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
What is the matter? 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
I will departe: his talke doeth so moche 
trouble me, me thinke he doeth wou~de my 
conscience. Also, I will home, and caste awaie 
a greate nomber of rotten drugges, 
wherewith I haue gotten moche money, in 
deceiuyng the people, God forgeue me. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
The vicar of sainct fooles be your ghostly 
father, are you so wise? Tarie still with 
me, let hym paie for your rotten drugges, 
[^f.C8v^] 
for I maie saie to you, that he is almoste 
rotten alreadie hymself: me thinke youre 
conscience is to moche spiced with sodaine 
deuotion. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What meane you Maister Doctour, to 
wisper in the Apothicaries eare? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Nothyng sir, but I haue appoincted at 
what tyme that you should receiue youre 
Clister, and how your Ptisante should bee 
made: and in what order that your frontarie 
should bee applied to your forehedde, to 
cause you to slepe quietlie. These dreames 
are nothing but proceading of the aboundance 
of choler, you are hote and drie: also 
the time is verie hote: the Sonne is now 
xx. degrees in Leo, the Dogge daies are to 
bee obserued. Notwithstandyng, feare nothyng, 
I warraunt you, life for life, discomforte 
not your self, a man or a Mouse. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
You are a merie ge~tleman, do your pleasure 
with me, I will put my self into your 
handes I tell you: holde here are. xx. olde 
Angelles, that did se no Sonne this tenne 
yere. Your Pothicarie shalbe well considered, 
[^f.D1r^] 
he semeth to bee an honest man, and a 
cunnyng fellowe: let him set vp all the boxes 
and glasses in the windowe, and putte 
on his bonette. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
What meane you sir, I pray you remember 
your self: so God helpe me, you are to 
blame: well, I will not contrarie you. My 
chief desire is to helpe you, without the respecte 
of money or golde or other of youre 
commoditee. Crispine, set the boxes in the 
window: and you, Surgean, prepare your 
lace, staffe and launce, with your vnce vesselles, 
that I maie consider his blood in order 
and due quantitee, for hether vnto he is 
but in the augmentyng of his feuer. Further, 
he had no fitte this ten houres, let him 
bloode by little and little, and although he 
doe fall into Lipothimion, it is no matter, 
let hym blood vntill it partly doe chaunge 
into a good colour. Oh Lorde, how might 
you liue? if this bloode should haue remained 
any longer, did you euer see the like? 
what a good hart he hath, the worst is past 
this would haue been a greate sore, or apostumacion: 
stop vp the vein a Gods name. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
[^f.D1v^] 
I did neuer see the like, but ones where 
as your Maistership did a greate cure, vpon 
a noble man. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Oh, are you aduised of that Crispine, he 
is a good friende of myne, I haue twentie 
pounde yerelie of him. He sente me a fatte 
Bucke vpon Mondaie laste, and gaue me 
my Mule also, with a Veluet foote clothe. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
Sir, whe~ you se~t me home, I left your mule 
standing at the doore, but as I returned, I 
met a lackei clothed in Orenge taunie and 
white, with a paire of bare ta~ned legges, & 
a blewe night cap, with a plume of fethers 
riding on him as fast as he might gallop. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Oh the passion of Christ, my mule is stolen, 
I will hence, I had rather lose .xx. li. I 
will tarie no le~ger: my Mule, I will teche 
[/10./] 
him to ride on my Mule, I warrante him. 
 
[}Crispine.}] 
 
Sir, he nedeth no teachyng, he can ride 
well I warrant you. I heard him saie to a 
yong manne with a long cloke, lined with 
yellowe, that his maister sent him to carie 
a letter, to a marchaunt venterer, that was 
[^f.D2r^] 
crossailed into Terra Florida. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Geue me my goune fare ye well Maister 
Antonius: as euil lucke as euer I had 
in all my life. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
I had thought the losse of your friende, 
and of your Mule, had not been both a like 
to you. What for .xx. pound, I will paie it 
double: the knaue shall not escape. Crispine 
hath taken good markes vpon him. I will 
sende to euery Warde, blinde lane, Innes 
Woodes and fieldes, after the villaine. I 
will take the matter on me, because you 
come to me so gently: quiete your self, sitte 
doune again in the chaire, I were caste awaie 
if you wer gone, good maister doctor. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
I care not so moche for the mule, but that 
the lorde will take moche vnkindnes, and 
think I should set light by his gift, and the 
Ruffians will laugh me to skorne, when 
thei knowe how I am ha~dled of the knaue 
boie. Well, I am co~tented with your offer 
I praie you beware you slepe not, you shal 
suppe the thinne broth of a chicken by and 
by, made with the .iiij. greate colde seedes 
[^f.D2v^] 
and cordiall Herbes. Crispine, I praie you 
make the broth in some stone or siluer vessell. 
Copper or Brasse is not good for Maister 
Antonius: soche vessels are Leprous. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
If you wil haue it made of gold, you shal. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
We shall make shifte with other thinges: 
gold shal serue to deaurat or gilde your losinges, 
electuaries & manus christi withal. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Contented, so that it maketh on my side 
whatsoeuer it bee. But me thinke I feele 
slepe approaching, what shall I doe? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Drawe the Curtaines, open the lukette 
of the Windowe: set Sallowes about the 
bedde, besprinkled with vineger and rose 
water. Take of that hotte mantell, let his 
hedde and shoulders bee bolstred vp, lye not 
on youre backe, leane towardes this side, let 
vs talke together as friendes, why are 
you so heauie and yearthlike. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
I must nedes I was made of yearth, but 
where is the yearth placed, of which I was 
made, and of what fassion is it, althoughe 
[^f.D3r^] 
I walke vpon thesame, yet doe I stande in 
doubt of the matter. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
The yearth is moste heauie, and can bee in 
[/11./] 
no place, but in the middest of heauen, not 
moueable, but round & hangeth continually, 
aboute the whiche are the landes and 
cou~tries of the world fixed, which Aristotle 
doeth call Medium terræ, medium mundi. 
 
[}Auarus.}] 
 
Ar ther not bodies, which ar called simple? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Yes forsoth, those are the iiij. the fire hot 
[/12./] 
and drie, the aire hote and moiste, the water 
colde and moyste, the yearth colde and 
drie, and these are called the Elementes. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Are there not bodies called mixed, what 
are thei? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Animalia: as man, beast, fishe, foule and 
[/13./] 
Wormes, Vegetabilia, as Herbe, Grasse 
and Trees, and mineralia, thinges under 
the yearth, as metalles. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Lorde, how is this worlde staied? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
[^f.D3v^] 
The twoo Pooles Articus and Artarticus 
South and North, are the extreme limites 
aboute whom the whole frame of heauen 
is wrapped, and is called Axie cœli:. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Men saieth that certaine starres doe gouerne 
the thinges beneth here in yearth. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
They doe so in deede, as it is wel proued 
when as the Sunne and Moone doe enter 
into any of their circles, in those great bodies, 
then our little bodies in yearth dooe 
feele the goodnes or euilnes of them, as Aries, 
Leo, and Sagittarius,are hote, drie, and 
bitter, cholorike, and are gouernyng hotte 
and drie thinges, and this is called the firy 
triplicitee. The seconde triplicitee, is of aire 
hotte and moiste, sanguine, swete, and doe 
gouerne Sanguine people. And other tirplicitie 
is of water, colde & moiste, flegmatike, 
hauing the gouernment of cold rawe 
bodies. The laste is the yearth, the mother 
of all thinges, cold and drie melancholie. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What doe the knowlege of these thynges 
profite to Phisicke, I praie you tel me? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
[^f.D4r^] 
Moste chiefly: for where as the Philosopher 
dooe leaue, there the Phisicion dooe 
begin. That is, he must be first a good natural 
Philosopher, he must haue y=e= knowlege 
of times and seasons, and be acquainted 
with complexio~s of men, obseruing the 
nature of thinges, and the climates vnder 
heaue~, with the course of the Sonne, Moon 
and Starres, Aire and diet. &c. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
I praie you, is there a soule in manne? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Yes forsothe. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Why then there must nedes be a greater 
thing, as the cause of euery liuing soule 
[/14./] 
whiche I take to bee GOD, whiche hath 
made all thinges, and when you and I talked 
together, you semed that, No~ est deus. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
I professed to followe Aristotle, but my 
meaning was, that I credite not the Bible 
matters, I am no Diuine, I finde no reasons 
there for my tourne: thei are to harde 
thinges for me, I commend them to Darbell 
and Duns. &c 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
[^f.D4v^] 
Why, doeth Aristotle shewe any better 
reasons then is in the Bible? Then I pray 
you: what is the power of the soule? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
In the soule saieth Aristotle in his boke of 
Ethiques, he hath .iij. sondrie powers. The 
[/15./] 
one is named vegitable, in whiche euery 
man taketh parte with herbes, trees, and 
plantes. The seconde parte of the soule is 
named sensible: in this part man and beast 
are bothe a like in mouyng. &c. The thirde 
parte is more, whiche is racionall, or hauing 
reason. And this part of reason hath 
both acte to doe well, and power to do euil. 
And these ij. are called Intellectiue, whiche 
learneth, deserneth and iudgeth in euery 
thing that maie be seen, felt, heard, or vnderstanded: 
but the power vnreasonable, 
as sodaine raging, criyng. &c. Is ascribed 
vnto the Lion, Horse, Hogge. &c. How like 
you this maner of talke, yet here is no scripture, 
but Aristotle, I assure you. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Then it should appere, that the soule hath 
vertues: how many I praie you? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
The first vertue is called Intellectual, fro~ 
[^f.Dvr^] 
whiche springeth wisedome, science & prudence. 
And the .ij. is called moral, which is 
the mother of many good thinges, as chastitee, 
liberalitee, humanitee, & good maners. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What is the cause of these twoo vertues 
in the soule? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
The vertue Intellectual, ingendereth and 
is nourished by learning of good tutours, 
and men of experience, or readyng of good 
bookes of Philosophie: whiche is a secrete 
vertue in the soule. And also the morall cometh 
by good custome, and not by nature, 
as if one manne had twoo soonnes, the one 
brought vp in keping cattelle, the other in 
[/16./] 
daily learning good lessons, although nature 
did frame their bodies like in shape, 
yet thei should not bee like in condicions: 
morall prouideth, that naturall thinges in 
them bothe, can not bee moued by contrarie 
custome. For stones naturally, though 
thei be cast neuer so high by arte, yet must 
thei naturally fall doune againe. Euen so 
of fire being driuen doune, yet it will caste 
his flames vpwarde: so vertue is not in vs 
by nature, but onely by power to receiue 
[^f.D5v^] 
theim, for euery thing that is in vs by 
nature: first it is in vs bi powers, & after co~meth 
to acte, as it commeth to the senses of 
mankinde. For none can deny, but firste 
manne hath power to heare, see, feele. &c. 
So the power doeth preuente, and cometh 
before the acte in nature. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Then if power goeth before thacte, then 
a man is called honest, good, or chaste, before: 
either nonestie, goodnesse, or chastitie 
appereth in him. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
In thinges morall, euermore the acte goth 
before the power. An example: a Schoolemaister 
is called a Teacher, because of his 
learnyng, whiche is the worke goyng before 
the power. And the cause of a good ma~ 
is his good workes: and so of the eiuill, 
whose woorke is either dronkennesse, adultrie, 
thefte. &c. thei make him euill. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Then it should appere, that this thyng 
called Actus, or woorke, bringeth vertue 
and vice in man. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
What els, doeth not euery man that liueth 
[^f.D6r^] 
eate? But if he eate to moche or to little, 
doeth it not bring sicknesse? Euen so of 
to moche laboure or idlenesse, of to moche 
boldnesse or cowardnesse, are not these actes 
vicious and euill? And dooeth not one 
meane moderate theim bothe? Extreames 
are euer hurtfull. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What remedie then I praie you? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Nothyng is better then a meane, called 
temperaunce, whiche is gouerned by prudence, 
[/17] 
whiche is euer contente betwene 
bothe, and reioyseth in it. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
So then, if a man felle into extreme aduersitie, 
[/18] 
and sustaine it paciently in his sickenesse, 
pouertie, or cause of grief, call you 
this a meane, or no. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
In euery woorke or sufferyng, there is 
pleasure or displeasure. If a manne doe reioyce 
in trouble, in chastitie, in bearyng of 
[/19] 
cruell wordes or slau~der, thesame is a prudent 
manne, and his suffering maketh it a 
meane to him: but other men that are chastised, 
and will suffer outwardlie, and it 
[^f.D6v^] 
greeueth theim in so doyng, thesame is vicious, 
and laceth meane, or prudence. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Hath the soule any delites in her or no? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Yes trulie, in three thinges. The firste 
[/20./] 
profitable, whereof springeth housbandrie 
to nourishe the yearth, as also Phisicke to 
help the bodie, knighthod to go to battel. &c 
The seconde is delectable, as taking pleasure 
[/21./] 
in thinges doen, which is chiefly nourished 
of the soule, in whiche consisteth all 
the pleasures of the worlde. The thirde is 
[/22./] 
called good, that is to be vertuous, louing, 
sober, pacie~t; and also to the soule or minde, 
are enioyned, habite, power, and passion. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Haue yong childre~ the soule in al poinctes 
as wome~ haue or no, in operacio~ or eleccio~ 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Aristotle saieth: that operacion of the will 
of the soule, is common to children, but the 
election or choice, be not in them to will. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
What is will in the soule? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
The will is the entente, but eleccion is 
[^f.D7r^] 
the antecedent to the entente, for eleccion 
goeth before operacion or woorke, and the 
worke doeth followe thesame, as doyng of 
thinges, buiyng, selling, and all the artes 
and sciences, are so to be considered. Firste, 
by eleccion, then by operacion, as by art I 
[/23./] 
do proue you to haue the pestilence, experience 
hath taught me, whiche yong children 
can not knowe, as Gramer, Rhetorike, 
Musicke, Phisicke, before thei haue 
lerned the~, or begun with their principles. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
Now I will stoppe and laie a strawe, and 
commen as yet no more of the matters of 
the soule, but onely of the body, and namely 
in this poinct of the pestilence. What is 
[/24./] 
the cause of thesame, good Maister doctor? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
That whiche we do se, we do testifie, and 
that which we do testifie is true. Therfore 
[/25./] 
no man ought in matters, which apperteineth 
to the estate of life, to write fables or 
lies, but that which is of great aucthoritee 
and of good experience. This pestilent feuer, 
saieth Hipocrates, is in two partes co~sidered: 
[/26./] 
the first is common to euery man, 
by corrupcion of the aire. The seconde is 
[^f.D7v^] 
priuate or particular to some men through 
euill diet, replecion, which bringeth putrificaccion, 
and finally mortificacion. And Galen 
in the diffrences of feuers, doth affirme 
thesame, saiyng: Vnam aerem viciatum ac 
putridum, altera~ homoree corporis virioso 
[/27./] 
victu colectos, & ad putrescendu~ paratos. 
Auicen also, Tractus quartus de febrib~ pestilentialibus. 
cap. i. Whe~ there doeth come 
a sodain alteracion or chaunge in the qualitie 
of water, fro~ cold to heate, or transmutacion 
from swetenes to stincke, as it chaunceth 
in waters, through corrupted mixture 
of putrified vapours, infectyng bothe aire & 
water, whiche of their own simplicitie are 
cleane, but through euill mixture are poisoned: 
or when strong windes doe cary pestile~t 
[/28./] 
fume or vapours from stinkyng places, 
to the cleane partes, as bodies dedde of 
the plague, vnburied, or mortalitie in battail, 
death of cattell, rotten fennes, coming 
[/29./] 
sodainly by the impression of aire, creping 
to the harte, corrupting the spirites, this is 
a dispersed pestilence by the inspiracion of 
the aire. Also by repletion, Venus, bathyng, 
or openyng the pores, rotten foode, fruiet, 
moche Wine, or immoderate laboure, or 
[^f.D8r^] 
the time being hote and moiste. These are 
greate causes. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
At what time of the yere dooeth the Pestilence 
caste forthe her poison? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
In the time of Haruest saieth Hypocrates, 
[/30./] 
are moste sharpe and dedlie sicknesses, 
but lesse daunger in the Spring time: and 
in the time of sondrie chaunge of Windes 
when the weather is hotte and moiste. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
To what persones I praie you, doeth the 
Pestilence come? 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Moste chiefly to them, vnder the place infected, 
then to slotishe beastlie people, that 
kepe their houses and lodginges vnclene, 
their meate, drincke, and clothyng moste 
noisome, their labour and trauell immoderate, 
or to theim whiche lacke prouident 
wisedome, to preuente the same by good 
diete, aire, Medicine. &c. Or to the bodies 
hotte and moiste. And these bodies doe infecte 
other cleane bodies, and whereas many 
people do dwell on heapes together, as 
Auecen saieth: Et communicat multitudine 
[^f.D8v^] 
homimum, &c. Fen. j. Tra. iiij. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
By what signe or token is this perilous 
plague or stripe of the Pestilence, best knowen 
emong the Phisicions. Go not about 
the bushe with subtile woordes, but plainlie 
speake the truthe to me, beyng in this 
fearfull daunger, as you doe well knowe 
that I am in. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
The signes are moste manifest whiche are 
[/31./] 
the starres ru~ning course or rase after their 
causes. Oh the most fearfull eclipses of the 
Sunne and Moone, those heauenlie bodies 
are manifest signes of the pestilence emo~g 
men, and the starres cadente in the beginning 
of Haruest, or in the moneth of September, 
or moche South winde or Easte 
winde in the Canicular daies, with stormes 
and cloudes, and very cold nightes and extreme 
hot daies, & moche chaunge of weather 
in a little time, or whe~ birds do forsake 
their egges, flies or thinges breding vnder 
the grounde, do flie high by swarmes into 
the aire, or death of fishe or cattelle, or any 
dearth going before, these ar the signes of 
the pestile~ce, & euident presages of thesame. 
 
[^f.E1r^] 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
These are good signes generalle, but 
particulare: what manifest tokens doe signifie 
the Plague or Pestilence in a mannes 
owne proper bodie. 
 
[}Medicus.}] 
 
Thei whiche are smitten with this stroke 
[/32./] 
or plague, are not so open in the spirites as 
in other sicknesses are, but straite winded, 
thei doe swone and vomite yellowe cholour, 
swelled in the stomacke with moche 
pain, breaking forth with stinking sweat. 
The extreme partes verie cold, but the 
internall partes boiling with heate and burnyng, 
no reste, bloode distillyng from the 
nose: Vrine somwhat watrie and sometyme 
thicke with stincke, sometyme of colour 
yellowe, sometyme blacke; scaldyng 
of the tongue, ordure most stinkyng, with 
redde iyen, corrupted mouthe with 
blacknes, quicke pulse and depe, but weake, hed 
ache, altered voice, losse of memorie, sometime 
with ragyng in strong people. These 
and soche like are the manifest signes, how 
the hart hath drawen the venome to it, by 
attraccion of the aire: by the inspiracion of 
the arters to the harte, and so confirming it 
[^f.E1v^] 
to be the perilous feuer Pestile~ciall. This 
is moste true: of this cometh foule bubos, 
antaxis and carbuncles, sores, through putrifaccion, 
as Galene saieth: li. iii. De presage. 
Auicen Fe. i. tract iiii. Gal. lib.i. De dif. 
fe. cap. iiii. & Rasis de constitutione pestile~tiæ 
ad mansorem. Also this feuer is skante 
to be recoured, and almoste past help, whe~ 
these Symptomatas doe appyere, as Galene 
saieth. iii. De præsage ex pul. qua propter 
negue hos curare tentandum erit. 
 
[}Antonius.}] 
 
You haue declared vnto me a fearfull tale 
of the Plague, wherof thousandes haue 
and shall die: a pitifull case how it cometh 
emong people sodainly, euen as you haue 
shewed, the cause primatiue in thaire. The 
antecedent, when thesame aire is drawen 
[/33/] 
into the hart by attractio~ of the arters: the 
coniunct when it with boiling heat, doeth 
chaunge by putrifaccion, nature into the 
worse parte, and almost paste cure of any 
Phisician, when it is come to this poincte, 
as I gather by your late talke, which doth 
putte me in greate feare of my life. But I 
will common with you for others, whiche 
are not infected, howe maie thei bee moste 
[^f.E2r^] 
safely defended, maister Doctor?
