[}A brief Discourse of the Planetary Hours, and how 
to find them at any time of the Day or Night 
for ever. 
 
By JOHN GADBURY, Student in Astrology.}] 
 
Quod fælix fu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]umque sit. 
 
AStrologers have observed by man-fold Experience that 
the Natures, Humours, and Iclinations of Men are 
distinguished, not only from the predominant Planets ruling 
the Hyleg_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]cal Points at Birth, but also from the Lords of the 
Planetary Hours under which they were born, and that each 
part or portion of Time, doth impart some Magnetical Virtue 
to each Person it produceth; whence issues all the variety 
and dissimilitude among Mortals. 
 
Thus we come to understand - That a Person born in 
the Hour of Saturn, as touch'd with a Saturnine Magnet, is 
ever Musing, Grave, Serious, Silent, Thoughtful, doing little 
Good, except he find his own account in it. 
 
If born under the Hour of Iupiter, he commonly proves 
Modest, Temperate, Sober, Affable, Courteous, Compassionate, 
Charitable. 
 
When in the Hour of Mars, the Native is subject to Passion, 
Rashness, S_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], Treachery, Confidence, Contradiction, &c. 
 
If in the Hour of the Sun, he is Ambitious, Aspiring, Disdainful, 
Imperious, Covetous of Honour and Dominion, Generous. 
 
Such as are born in the Hour of Venus, are propense to 
Mirth, Jesting, Amorousness, Affability, Courtil_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], Dalliances. 
 
Persons born in the Hour of Mercury, are devoted to Policy, 
Subtilty, Craft, Deceit, and to project and devise many 
things. 
 
Those born in the Hour of the Moon, are Mutable, Inconstant, 
Timorous, delighted in Novelties, apt to Travel. 
 
And whus we find that as one Day differs from another, so 
also doth [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
but likewise in the Actions of Men. Each Action hath a different 
Cœlestial Parent or [^ORIG. BLURRED^] this Planetary 
Regency may in part be [^ORIG. BLURRED^]. 
 
[^f.C1v^] 
The Learned Author of Religio Medici, fortifies this Doctrine 
from an Observation in himself, viz - 'I was (saith 
'he) born in the Planetary Hour of Saturn, and I think I have 
'a piece of that Leaden Planet in me. I am no way facetious, 
'or disposed for the mirth or Galliardize of Company; 
'yet in one Dream I can compose a whole Comedy, behold 
'the Actions, apprehend the jests, &c. Part. 11. Sect 11. 
 
Now, if somewhat of Melancholly may be distinguish'd in 
such as are born in the hour of Saturn, 'tis as reasonable to 
believe that Choller and Passion may be perceptible in those 
born in the hour of Mars. Honour, Ambition, Generosity, 
in such as are brought forth in the hour of the Sun. Mirth, 
Delights, in those that salute the Light in the hour of Venus. 
And so of the rest. 
 
Pray observe, I do not pretend to make the Planetary 
Hour a total or absolute Cause of the various Differences and 
Propensions in Men; but a partil Cause only, and not to 
be excluded the number of Astrological Causes: For a man 
may be born in the hour of Venus, and yet at sometimes be 
a great Sharer in Melancholly. As if Saturn obviate the Horoscope, 
of the Moon, &c. And another may be born in the 
hour of Saturn, and yet at some times unbend the Bow, and 
be merry. Tho I say, not from his being born in that Melancholly 
hour, but from some Lucid Radiations, which at 
that time may happen. The severest of Mortals, even a 
ridgid Caro, may sometimes brisk it, as the Reverend Judges 
do in Christmas time - Semel in Auno, Ridet Apollo. Howbeit, 
such pleasant Rays cannot so cloud, or rather permute 
the Dominion of Saturn, but that he will assert his Soveraignty, 
and be obey'd too, when he has a mind to shew his 
Power. Of which truth, I could produce many Instances 
were it needful: but my design is brevity. I will therefore 
come closely to the matter, and declare to you the reason of, 
and the ready way to find the planetary hour at any time, 
Day or Night. 
 
And here we are first to know, that before we can arrive 
at any knowledg of the Planetary hours, we first of all must 
have an acquaintance with the Planetary days. 
 
The Days of the Week being in number Seven, are called 
after the Names of the Seven Planets, who, as Astrologers 
teach, have a Gubernal Influence over them. As the 
[^f.C2r^] 
Good Planets presiding over the Good Days; the Bad Planets 
governing the Evil Days; and the Planets of a middle Nature 
bearing rule over days Indifferent, viz. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
[^Symbol of Sun omitted.^]. Sol Rules over Sunday. Good. 
[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. Luna [^Rules over^] Monday. Indifferent. 
[^Symbol of Mars omitted.^]. Mars [^Rules over^] Tuesday Bad. 
[^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^]. Mercury [^Rules over^] Wednesday Indifferent. 
[^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^]. Jupiter [^Rules over^] Thursday. Good. 
[^Symbol of Venus omitted.^]. Venus [^Rules over^] Friday. Good. 
[^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^]. Saturn [^Rules over^] Saturday. Bad. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
 
Hence it's observable, That the Week consists (1.) of three 
Good Days, which are govern'd by the Sun, Jupiter, Venus. 
(2.) Of two Bad Days, over which Saturn and Mars preside. 
(3.) Of two Indifferent Days, and those are ruled by Mercury 
and the Moon. Thus the Natures and Dispositions of the 
Days of the Week are suited to the Tempers and Qualities of 
the Planets, and seem properly to derive an Impression from 
their Influences. 
 
The several Names of the Planets, are said to be given to 
them in the first Ages of the World, after long Observation 
made of them. And some Learned in Astrology do opinion, 
- That their Government over the days of the Week, 
was first conferr'd on them by the Old Saxons: As agreeing 
to the Names of their VII Chief Idols, who by the Priests of 
those days, were dedicated unto the VII Planets, as their 
Representatives upon Earth. And for the same, or semblable 
Reasons we are to understand, the Hours of the Day 
were called after the Planets Names. 
 
Now we must note, there can be no Day so Good, but contains 
some cross and melancholly Hours; Nor yet any one 
so Bad, wherein there may not be met some friendly parts of 
Time. And hence it happens, that an unfortunate Person 
(so called) may be born upon a good Day; and a Darling of 
Fortune (so esteemed) may be brought into the World on a 
day reputed Inauspicious. It is the Time or Hour of the Day, 
that makes the difference in Human Births or Actions. And 
that is in all regards principally to be heeded. 
 
For the more easy finding of the Planetary Hour, Day 
or Night, the Astrologers of our Days (following the footsteps 
[^f.C2v^] 
of the Ancients) do divide the Natural Day (which 
consists of twenty four Hours) into Four equal Parts: 
Each part containing Six Planetary Hours, which said Parts 
or Hours, consist of unequal Portions of time, excepting 
when the Sun makes his Entrance into the Equinoxes. That 
is to say, the First Part contains that quantity of time, which 
is included between Sun Rising and Noon, be it more or 
less. The Second Part consists of that portion of time as 
passes between Noon and Sun Setting. The Third Part is 
contained between the Sun Setting and Midnight. And the 
Fourth Part reacheth from Midnight to Sun Rising the next 
day. 
 
And this Division is Universally observed in all the habitable 
World; the Oriental, Meridional, Occidental, and Septantrional 
points being hereby known. 
 
But now, since the Days of the Week, &c. are constantly 
either increasing or decreasing, and in respect of their Length 
or Shortness ever varying, as the Sun (the Mundane Pendulum) 
makes his (seeming) Access to us, or Recess from us, the 
Planetary Hour will be of a different length. But let the 
Days be of what length or brevity soever, the Planetary Hour 
does constantly consist of one sixth part of one quarter thereof, 
as before: for that four times Six makes up the whole 
Circle of Twenty four Hours. 
 
And here you are to Note, That as the Planetary Hour by 
Day increaseth, so by Night it decreaseth. And so on the contrary. 
And at all times of the Year, the length of the Planetary 
Hour of the Day and Night being added together do always 
make two Hours. 
 
Further, you may please to observe, That the Planet ruling 
the Day, doth ever govern the First and Eighth Hour thereof. 
As for Example; if it be desired to know, what Planet 
ruleth the First and Eighth Hour upon Sunday? The answer 
is, the Sun, he being the proper Regnant Planet over that 
Day. If the same question be put in concerning Monday? The 
answer is, the Moon; she being the Empress thereof. If the 
same question be made of a Saturday? The answer is, Saturn; 
she being the Grand Sultan, or Ruler thereof. Et sic 
de cætoris. Where not, that the first Planetary Hour ever 
commences at Sun Rising. 
 
[^f.C3r^] 
And you may also know, That after the same manner it 
fareth with the Rulers of the Planetary Hours by Night. For 
the same Planet that rules the Night, doth govern the First 
and Eighth Hours thereof. And the first Planetary Hour by 
Night doth always begin at Sun Setting; and the Eighth 
Planetary Hour, is the second after Midnight. 
 
This following Table shews us the order of the Nocturnal 
Rulers. 
 
[^Beginning of a list figure.^] 
[^Symbol of Sun omitted.^]. Sunday Night is govern'd by [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^]. Jupiter, and esteemed Good. 
[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. Monday [^Night is govern'd by^] [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^]. Venus, [^and esteemed^] Good. 
[^Symbol of Mars omitted.^]. Tuesday [^Night is govern'd by^] [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^]. Saturn, [^and esteemed^] Bad. 
[^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^]. Wednesday [^Night is govern'd by^] [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^]. The Sun, [^and esteemed^] Good. 
[^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^]. Thursday [^Night is govern'd by^] [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. Moon, [^and esteemed^] Indifferent. 
[^Symbol of Venus omitted.^]. Friday [^Night is govern'd by^] [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^]. Mars, [^and esteemed^] Bad. 
[^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^]. Saturday [^Night is govern'd by^] [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^]. Mercury, [^and esteemed^] Indifferent. 
[^End of a list figure.^] 
 
By this short Table you will readily find,- That Sunday, 
Monday, and Wednesday Nights are reputed Good; because govern'd 
by the good Planets, [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] Jupiter, [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] Sol, [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] Venus. 
That Thursday and Saturday Nights, are esteem'd Indifferent; 
for that they are ruled by [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] the Moon, and [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] Mercury. And 
that Tuesday and Friday Nights are termed Bad; as being 
govern'd by [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn, and [^Symbol of Mars omitted^] Mars. 
 
Hence also you may further observe,- that as [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] Jupiter 
ruleth over Sunday-night, so by the former Rule, he hath a 
Regency over the first and eighth Hours thereof; accounting 
from Sun setting. And thus likewise you will find [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] Mars to 
have Dominion over Friday-night; and consequently over the 
first and eighth Hours thereof; reckoning from Sun setting, 
as before. And after the same manner you are to understand 
how the Rulers over the other Nights are known. As is very 
plain by the foregoing Table. 
 
The Learned Author of Pseud. Epidem. tells us, - The 
Original of this Planetary Government is very high - As 
old as the Ancient Egyptians, who thought the VII. Planets 
(those admired Stars of Heaven) to be so many several Deities, 
(as did the Saxons before-mention'd) and hence it was 
that they ascribed this power to them. And of their Antiquity, 
some Eminent Vestigia may be found in the Sacred 
[^f.C3v^] 
Oracles. As for Instance, the god Baal, or the Sun. The 
god Moloch, or Saturn. Rempham, or Mercury. Regina Cœli; 
or the Moon; unto whom the Heathen Idolaters did commonly 
bake Cakes. Gad, or the Planet Jupiter. All Scripture 
Names. 
 
Now, this their Gubernal Authority they did not Exercise 
over the Days of the Week according to their Cœlestial Order, 
as ranged in the Ptolemaick System but after the manner 
of a Diatessero_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], or Musical Fourth. And thus beginning 
Saturday with [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn, they passed by [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] Jupiter 
and [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] Mars, and went to the [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] Sun, making Sunday. From 
the [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] Sun, in like manner, accounting by [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] Venus and [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] 
Mercury, they came to the [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] Moon, which made Monday. 
Thence they journied by [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn and [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] Jupiter, and went 
to [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] Mars, which denoted Tuesday. From [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] they passed by 
the [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] Sun and [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] Venus, and stayed at [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] Mercury, making 
Wednesday. From [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] Mercury, they leaving the [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] Moon and 
[^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn, rested at [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] Jupiter, who governs Thursday. From 
[^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] they accounted by [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] Mars and the [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] Sun to [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] Venus, 
who governs Friday. From [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] Venus they reckon'd by, [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] 
Mercury and the [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] Moon, unto [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn, or Saturday again. 
Thus ingeniously absolving the Hebdomadal Circle, they began 
for another Week, as before. 
 
And in the same order of the Planets, as found in Ptolemy's 
System, they establish'd the Hours of the Day and Night. For 
beginning to number from [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn (who governs Saturday) 
at Sun rising, they follow'd with [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] Jupiter, then [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] 
Mars, [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] Sol, [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] Venus, [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] Mercury, [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] Luna; and so beginning 
with Saturn again, accounting on until the whole twenty 
four hours are ended, which will be with [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] Mars. And the 
next day being Sunday, they began with the [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] again, at 
Sun rising. Whence numbring as before, we are brought to 
Monday morning, which begins at Sun rising with the hour 
of the Moon. And thus proceeding for the rest of the Days 
of the Week, viz. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, we 
are brought to Saturday again, from whence we first set out. 
And so we are to begin for another Week, still numbring 
from Sun rising each Day. 
 
I have met with a pretty Demonstration of the Hebdomadal 
Circle, (upon which the Doctrine of the Planetary Hours depend) 
in the Witty Frenchman, James Gaffarel, which is 
[^f.C4r^] 
performed by a Geometrical Figure, called Isosceles, or Equicrural; 
the Bases whereof are the Sides of a Heptagon described 
within a Circle. The same Scheme is also to be found 
in Morinus's Gallick Astrology. And in some other Astrolocal 
Authors. 'Tis this.- 
 
[^A figure with a heptagram and a corresponding heptagon inscribed within a circle, the points being marked with the planetary symbols, Saturn being at the bottom point.^] 
 
In this Figure, on the out-side thereof, all the Planets are 
set down according to their Order in the Ptolemaick System, 
as is evident, if you begin at [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn, and so reckon onward 
toward your Left hand, round the Circle, which is 
made thus, [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] Saturn, [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] Jupiter, [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] Mars, [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] Sol, [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] Venus, 
[^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] Mercury, [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] Luna. 
 
But now, if you cast your Eye within the Scheme, you 
will see it quite otherwise, For (as it is touch'd on before) 
from [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] or Saturday, you pass by a straight Line to [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] or Sunday. 
From [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^], by another straight Line you are carried to 
[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^], or Monday. From [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] you are brought by another like 
Line to [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^], or Tuesday. From [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] by another right Line 
[^f.C4v^] 
you are carried to [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] or Wednesday. From [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] by another 
straight Line you are conveyed to [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^], or Thursday. From [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] 
by another straight Line you arrive at [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], or Friday. And from 
[^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] by another straight Line you are brought to Saturday again. 
And so the Circle is finished. 
 
And thus you have it plainly demonstrated how the VII. 
Days of the Week, as govern'd by the VII. Planets, do in 
a most curious Mathematical Order succeed each other. 
 
Methinks this Argument seems so evident, as if it carried 
a charming Power in it; not only like Rhetorick to persuade, 
but like Logick to compel our Assent. For it looks 
like a Proof of too great force for any to conclude it the 
Dream or Contrivance of any one Single Person, though 
Master of the highest Reason, and never so Learned. It 
looks rather to be the Result of a Synod, or Colledge of many 
Learned Heads, furnish'd with Thoughts and Industry 
above the power of meer Single Humanity to effect. A particular 
Person may have a Rough-cast Notion of the Noblest 
and Sublimest Truths; but it must be the Work or Debate 
of many Heads, to bring them to any tolerable degree of 
Perfection, and fit to oblige and engage a Universal Credulity. 
 
I remember to have read in Sacred Writ, of a Colledge of 
Seers or Prophets: in which glorious Foundation all kind of 
Learning was preserv'd. And also, that there were therein 
Presidents, Governors, or Chief Professors of every Science; 
and among the rest, of Astrology. As is evinced by the Immortal 
Cowley, in Dav. Lib. 1. 
 
'The Course and POWER of Stars, Great Nathan taught, 
'And home to Man those distant Wonders brought: 
'How, towards both Poles the Sun's fix'd Journey bends, 
'And how the Year his crooked Walk attends. 
'By what just Steps the Wandring Lights advance, 
'And what Eternal Measures guide their Dance. 
 
And a little after, - 
 
'Of Men and Ages past, Seraiah read; 
'Embalm'd in long-liv'd History, the Dead. 
[^f.C5r^] 
'Shew'd the Steep falls, and slow Ascent of States: 
'What Wisdom, and what Follies makes their Fates. 
 
And of the Sons of the Prophets, he writes - 
 
'With hasty Wings, Time present they out-fly, 
'And tread the doubtful Maze of D_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]stiny. 
'There Walk and Sport among the Years to come, 
'And with quick Eye pierce every Causes Womb. 
 
And who knows, but that this Curious Demonstration of 
the Days of the Week, and their being thus orderly govern'd 
by the VII Planets, might proceed from some such Synod 
of Sacred Vertuesi, or Prophets? The thing is not improbable. 
But so positively to affirm, I dare not, because the Scriptures 
as to that very particular are silent. Howbeit, when 
we read in those Divine Leaves; of Schools, and Colledges, Professors 
of Sciences, &c we may not without reason presume, 
A Cultivation of the most useful Arts is therein justly intended; 
and thence the most likely to proceed. 
 
I spare to mention a great number of Learned Authors that 
have defended this Doctrine, both Ancient and Modern; but 
cannot omit to take notice, That the Venerable Chaucer (tho 
an Enemy to the Frauds of Astrologers (as what Honest Man 
is not? yet) hath approved of, and taught this Doctrine of 
the Planetary Hours. 
 
Nay, further, Antiquity assures us, That the Jews, who 
were the Illuminati, or God's inspired People in the first Ages 
of the World, were so fully persuaded of this Doctrine of the 
Planetary Hours, &c. that they had scarce any other (Genethliacal) 
Astrology among them, excepting the plain Scheme 
of the Birth-Hour,- Which Scheme they termed Machataloth, 
(i.e.) Ligaturæ. As believing the Fate of every 
Child born into the World to depend thereon. And hence 
they represented the XII Signs of the Zodiack in their Tabernacle 
by XII Loaves, which they call'd the Loaves of the Faces, 
as if the Destiny of all Humane-kind, in a Natural way, was 
therein to be read These Loaves they also placed in Two 
Rowes, understanding thereby the Northern and Southern 
Parts of the Ecliptick; as also the Upper and Lower Hemisphere, 
Vid. R. S. Franko's Truth springing, &c. 
 
[^f.C5v^] 
But to our Planetary Hours again.- You may find the 
Ancient Hebrew Tables of them, as well for Day as Night, 
in the unheard of Curiosities of Gaffarel, before-mentioned. 
In which Book he further assures us,- That the Machataloth 
above-mention'd, was no more then a Figure of 
XII Angles or Spaces, as is the Dodechedron now in use with 
Astrologers, which have Relation to the XII Parts of Humane 
Life. Whence it appears, that the Latin Distich expressing 
them, is of a greater Antiquity then we are aware 
of, perhaps of far greater than the Roman Monarchy, &c. 
viz. 
 
I. II. III. IV. V. VI. 
Vita, Lucrum, Fratres, Parentes, Nati, Valetudo, 
VII. VIII. IX. X. XI. XII. 
Uxor, Mors, Pietas, Regnum, Benefactaq; Carcer. 
 
Which Verses I have elsewhere thus Englished. 
 
'The First House notes Life. The Second, Wealth doth give. 
'The third, how Brethren; Fourth, how Parents live. 
'Issue, the fifth. The Sixth, Diseases bring. 
'The Seventh, Wedlock. And the Eighth, Death's sting. 
'The Ninth, Religion The Tenth, Honour shews. 
'Friendship, the Eleventh. And the Twelfth, our Woes. 
 
Now it is time to insert some Tables, whereby the Planetary 
Hours which we have been discoursing of, may at any 
time be found. And they shall be these two following. 
 
[^Tables for finding the planetary hours and examples of their use omitted.^]
