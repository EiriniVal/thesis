[^Extract 1, ff. A2r-C7r^] 
 
[^f.A2r^] 
THe ofter the science of 
[/1./] 
phisyke with curious 
and laboured oratio~s 
hath bene here in this 
place before y=e= more 
p~t of you come~ded, & 
that of men of singuler 
eloquence (moste noble audience) 
so moche surely the lesse truste and confidence 
haue I, that I shal eyther satisfie 
so great a thynge, or answere to the 
expectacion of your delicious eares. 
For neyther a thynge in maner diuine, 
our rude infancy shall easely attayne, 
nor a vulgare and commen oration of a 
thynge so oftentymes herde may in any 
wyse escape paynful tediousnes to the 
hearers. But yet, leste I shulde seme to 
be defectyfe, & disobedie~t to the ryght 
holsome ordinaunce of our fathers, whiche 
haue iudged it mete and expedient 
with solempne orations the hertes and 
courages of youth to be awakened, 
kyndeled, and enflamed to the studie, 
admiration and loue of this noble science/ 
my selfe also purpose to assay, to 
my power (if so be your atte~tifnes and 
gentlenes wyll vouchesaue to helpe me 
[^f.A2v^] 
in my speakynge, tenderly fauorynge 
whom your authoritie hathe dryuen to 
take this office vpon me) of the right excellent 
science of phisike the dignitie, 
[/2./] 
the authoritie, profite and necessitie, I 
wyl nat say to open and expounde, whiche 
were vtterly an infinite busines, but 
in a brefe summe onely to knyt vp, and 
as it were to shewe to the sytes of the studious 
youthe a glymmeryng (as a man 
[/3./] 
myght say) through a lattesie wyndowe 
of the moste copious and ple~teful treasours 
of a ryche quene. Of whome truely 
this (if there were nothyng els) is a soueraigne 
and excelle~t prayse, first that 
she neadeth nat at al that any ma~ shuld 
her commende or set forthe, beyng set 
forthe sufficiently of her owne selfe 
with the vtilitie, and profite, which ma~kynde 
[/4./] 
taketh by her, and also by the necessitie 
and nede that we haue of her. 
Secondarely that where as she hath ben 
alredy so oftymes of excellent wyttes 
comme~ded, yet she fyndeth of her selfe 
alwayes to wyttes also that be nat very 
pregnauut newe mater to prayse her, so 
that it neadeth nothyng to prayse here 
[^f.A3r^] 
(after the commen vsage) with enuious 
and hatefull comparisons nat without 
the preiudice and slaunder of other 
lernynges and craftes. Nay rather this 
thynge is more to be feared, leste her 
owne propre and domesticall gyftes 
and qualities, leste her naturall and 
germane amplitude, lefte her maiestie 
greater than is mannes estate and capacitie, 
no mortall mannes speache of 
tonge can compasse or attayne. So that 
she neadeth nothynge at all to be auansed 
and lyfted vp, other with any despitefull 
rebukes of other craftes, other 
with some borowed and paynted colours 
of the rhetoricians, or with the 
iugglynge castes of amplificacions. 
[/5./] 
It apperteyneth to meane beauties, by 
comparyson of the fowler, or by gorgeous 
deckynge and payntynge, to be 
sette forthe and commended. But 
thynges truely and of them selfes excedyngly 
and passynge beawtifull, it is 
ynough to haue shewed them ye naked 
to the eye. 
[/6./] 
For nowe first of al (to haste vs to 
[^f.A3v^] 
our mater) the other scie~ces I can nat denie 
because there is none of them but 
hath brought some great commoditie 
and profyte to the lyfe of ma~, haue ben 
in hyghe pryse and reputacion. But of 
[/7./] 
phisike in tymes passed so wo~derful to 
mankynde hath ben the inuencion, so 
swete the experience that the authours 
and fyrst inuentours therof, haue other 
[/8./] 
ben taken playnly for goddes (as Apollo, 
and his sonne Aesculapius) ye rather, 
[/9./] 
as Plinie witnesseth, euery thing inuented 
in this facultie and science was 
a cause sufficie~t to deifie and make goddes 
those that ware the inue~tours, or at 
leste, they were estemed worthy of heue~ly 
and diuine honours, as Asclepiades, 
[/10./] 
whom the Illiricans receyuyng in maner 
as a god, gaue hym egall honour 
with Hercules. Surely I do nat allowe 
that the antiquitie dyd in this thinge, 
[/11./] 
but yet I can nat but prayse and commende 
theyr affection, zele and iudgement, 
whiche ryghtly both thought and 
declared that to a konnyng and faythfull 
phisicion no sufficient nor worthy 
rewarde can be yelded. For, if a man 
recounteth with hym selfe, howe manyfold 
[^f.A4r^] 
diuersite there is in the bodies of 
[/12./] 
ma~, how great varietie of ages, of male 
and female, of regions, of ayers, of educacion, 
of studies, of customes, howe infinite 
difference in so many thousandes 
of herbes, (though I speake nothyng at 
this tyme of the other remedies) whiche 
growe in sondry countrees, some in one 
place and some in an other, Than how 
many kyndes of diseases, whiche Plinie 
writteth were rekened vp in olde tyme 
iii. hondreth by their names, beside the 
membres and partes of euery kinde, of 
whiche al, howe innumerable a multitude 
there is, he shal easely gesse whiche 
onely knoweth howe many formes and 
fashons the feuers or ague hath (so that 
of one the residue may be estemed) beside 
those whiche dayly encrease newe 
and new, nor none otherwyse encrease, 
than if of purpose they semed to haue 
taken vpon them open warres with our 
crafte. Besyde, more than a thousande 
peryls of poysoninges of which howe 
many sortes ther be euen so many kyndes 
of dethes therbe, requiring as many 
[/13./] 
differe~tes of remedies, Besyde the dayly 
casualties of falles, of ruynes, of brastynges, 
[^f.A4v^] 
of brennynges, of wrestynges 
out of ioynt, of woundes and such lyke 
whiche in maner do compare in numbre 
with the very rought of diseases, finally 
[/14./] 
he y=t= pondereth with hi~ self, how 
great difficultie is in the obseruyng the 
heuenly Planetes which, oneles the phisician 
knoweth, aftentymes that shalbe 
a poynson whiche is gyue~ for remedie. 
I wyll nat here reherse the ofte desceyuable 
tokens of diseases, other whether 
ye beholde the hauour of the colour, 
or enserche the signes of the vrine 
or obserue the harmonie of the pulse, 
euen as who shulde saye the euyls of 
mankynde were all together bent and 
sette to deceyue and mocke theyr ennemie 
the phisician. So greate a quantitie 
of difficulties and hardenesses on 
euery side come about and ouersprede 
them selues that it is harde for me them 
all with my wordes to compasse. But, 
as I began to saye, al these varieties of 
thynges with studie to attayne, these obscurities 
with wytte to comprehende, 
these difficulties with labour to ouercome, 
and persyng through the bowels 
of the erthe, bultynge out euery where 
[^f.A5r^] 
the preuities of al the hole nature, out 
of all herbes, shrubbes, trees, beastes, 
precious stones ye finally out of eue~ the 
very venyms & poysons, to al the euyls 
of ma~s lyfe, liuely & effectual remedies 
to seke, & of these the ryght & due vse 
out of so many authors, so many scie~ties 
ye euen out of the very sterres & planettes 
to fetche. These I say so hydde, with 
care to rote out, so harde, with the powers 
of the mynde to wynne, so many, 
w=t= memorie to co~passe, so necessarie to 
the preseruacio~ of al ma~kynde to bryng 
forth abrode, do it nat seme vtterly beyond 
[/15./] 
mans co~passe, & playnly a certein 
diuine thyng? Let no man haue enuye at 
my saynges. Suffre me boldly to speke 
that which is true as the euangel, I do 
nat boste my selfe, but I extolle & magnifie 
[/16./] 
the very scie~ce. For if to gyue lyfe 
is the propre & peculiare benefite of 
god, surely to kepe & preserue it wha~ it 
is ones gyue~, and to retayne it styl whan 
it is euen now fleyng away, we muste of 
necessitie confesse to be a gyfte and benifite 
next vnto goddes, howe be it nat 
so moch as y=t= former benefite which we 
wyl haue appropriate only to god, the 
antiquite 
[^f.A5v^] 
plucked nat awaye from the phisiciens 
crafte, whiche antiquitie although they 
were lyght of credence geuyng, yet vndowtedly 
they were full of gratitude 
and kyndnes. For by the helpe of that 
[/17./] 
worthy phisicion Esculapius, it was 
thought in olde tyme that Tyndarides 
and after hym many mo returned forth 
out of hell into lyfe and lyght agayne. 
Xanthus an historiographer leuyth to 
vs in writtyng that a yonge Lyon which 
was slayne, and also a man whom a dragon 
had kylled were restored agayne 
to lyfe by the vertue of a certayn herbe 
whiche they called Halin. More ouer 
[/18./] 
one Iuba witnesseth that in Afrike a certayne 
p~sone was called agayne to lyfe 
by an herbe. Nor I do nat greatly passe 
althoughe some persones perauenture 
wyll gyue litle credence to these. Surely 
(the thynge that we go aboute) these 
wonderfull effectes of phisike do so 
moche the rather augment and encrease 
the admiration of the science, the more 
that they appere to be beyonde the credens 
of the trouthe and they constraine 
men to graunt that thynge to be of an 
incomparable excellencie, which in maner 
[^f.A6r^] 
seme to surmont the truthe. Howe 
be it concernyng hym which is restored 
to lyfe, what recketh it, whether the soule 
be put agayne by goddes ha~dworke 
into the forsaken lymmes, or by the 
crafte aud cure of the phisicion, the lyfe 
or soule of ma~ vtterly buried as it were 
in the bodie and oppressed with the powers 
of the disease which lyke a co~querour 
hathe gotten the vpper hande, be 
raysed and subtylly fetched out & hold 
styl, which els shuld without fayle forthwith 
haue departed away? be nat these 
two thi~ges in maner of lyke vertue and 
egal power, to restore the deed, and to 
saue hym whiche by and by shuld haue 
dyed? But Plinie reherseth very many 
and that by name in the seue~th boke of 
[/19./] 
the historie of the worlde, whiche after 
they were deed and borne out on the 
beare reuiued agayne partly in the very 
pytte where as they shuld be buryed or 
(accordyng to the vsage of the countre 
in the pyle of wode wherin they shulde 
haue bene burned, whiche pyle was called 
of them Rogus) & partely they reuiued 
many dayes after they were deed 
and before any burial. This we take 
[^f.A6v^] 
for a miracle and a wonderful thynge/ 
which a chaunce and a casualtie hath gyuen 
to a fewe. And is nat it than moche 
more to be wondered of/ whiche dayly 
our science gyueth to many? howe be it 
I can nat denye but the goodnes of god 
is to be thanked for this our science, to 
god we owe it/ to whome, there is nothyng 
but that we owe, leste perchaunce 
a man wolde thynke these to be spoken 
more presumptuously and arrogantly 
than truely. Of many diseases suche 
is the violence and strenght, that death 
is certayne oneles the present helpe of 
the phisician be at hande, as that kynde 
of traunce whiche is wont to chaunce 
moste to wome~, and as a depe and profounde 
syncopis, the palsay, with suche 
lyke. Nor there is commonly none but 
that ones in his tyme other seeth or hereth 
of suche examples of what nation 
so euer he be. He than which in this case 
dryueth awaye death whiche euen nowe 
hangeth ouer the pacientes heed and redy 
to stryke with his dart, he (I saye) 
that thus calleth agayne lyfe sodeynly 
oppressed/ is nat he alwayes to be had 
and reputed in a maner as a certayne 
[^f.A7r^] 
mercyfull god? yes vndoutedly. Howe 
many men, thynke ye, were buried before 
their daye in olde tyme before or 
the witty inuencion of phisicians hadde 
founde out the strengthes of diseases & 
the natures of remedies? howe many 
thousandes of men at this daye do lyue 
and farewell whiche shulde neuer haue 
ben borne oneles the same our crafte 
had inuented aswel remedies for so many 
dau~gers of chyldbaryng, as the feat 
& polecie of mydwyuyng? So eue~ forthwith 
in the very entrie into lyfe aswell 
the woma~ that lyeth in and laboureth. 
as the chylde that is in bearyng with lamentable 
voyce crye for the holsome 
ayde of phisicia~s. To the phisicia~s craft 
he oweth his lyfe, ye whiche as yet hath 
nat receiued life, whyle thrugh it abortions 
be prohibeted, whyl power is geue~ 
to the woman of receiuyng & reteinyng 
mans sede, finally while the power also 
of deleuering and brynging forthe the 
chyld into this world is geue~. That if it 
be truely spoken of them in olde tyme, 
[/20./] 
Deus est iuuare mortale~, that is to saye. 
To helpe mortal men, is to be a god or 
y=e= prop~te & worke of a god, truly i~ my 
[^f.A7v^] 
minde y=t= noble prouerbe of the Grekes 
[/21./] 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] 
whiche is, that man is a god to man, other 
hath no where his place, or vpon a 
faythfull and good phisician it shalbe 
principally verified and haue place, 
which nat only helpeth, but also saueth 
And is nat he than an excedyng vnkynd 
person and in maner vnworthy to lyue 
whiche phisike the seconde (next god) 
parent of lyfe, the defendresse, the saueresse, 
the protectresse can nat fynde i~ his 
hart to loue, to honour, to magnifie, to 
worshipe? Of whose ayde and socours 
there is no person but nedeth continually, 
for of the reste of craftes neyther 
we all, nor yet alwayes haue nede, but 
in the profyte and vtilite of this, al the 
hole lyfe of man standeth, for ymagyne 
diseases were gone, ymagine prosperous 
helth to be with euery one, yet how 
shal we kepe it, oneles the physicyon 
taught vs the diuersite of holsome and 
vnholsome meates, oneles he taught a 
waye and a forme to diete our selues? 
Age is a greuous and paynful burde~ to 
mortal creatures, which to escape is no 
[^f.A8r^] 
more lawful for vs than deth it selfe. 
[/22./] 
But yet this age through the helpe and 
payne of the phisicion chaunseth to many 
men, both later tha~ it shulde els haue 
done, and also moch more easelier and 
lyghter. For it is no fable, that by the 
quinte essentie (as they call it) agednes 
dryuen awaye, man doth floryshe and 
waxe a yonge man agayne by castyng a 
way (as it were) his olde skynne, sythe 
ther be bothe in writtynges and other 
wyses, many recordes of the same. Nor 
agayne nat onely of the body whiche is 
the vyler parte of man this our craft taketh 
cure, nay rather it taketh the cure 
of the hole man althoughe that the diuine 
and professour of Theologie shall 
take his begynnyng of the mynde, and 
[/23./] 
the phisicio~ of the body. For truely, because 
of the most streyght allyance and 
knotte of familiaritie of them twayne 
to gether, lyke as the vyces of the mynd 
do redownde into the bodie, so agayne 
on the other halfe the diseases of the bodie 
other do let, or els do vtterly quenche 
the stre~ght and power of the soule. 
who is so styffe and stronge an entyser 
and mouer of abstinence, of sobrenes. 
[^f.A8v^] 
of mesuryng yre, of fleyng heuynes, of 
eschuyng surfete, of castyng away loue, 
of refrainyng the luste of body, as is the 
phisician? who more lyues hely aud effectually 
counselleth the syckman that if 
he wyl lyue and fele the holsome helpe 
and aide of the phisician that first he repurgeth 
his minde from the filthynes of 
vices? The same phisician so ofte as he 
by geuing and prescribing a forme and 
maner of diete, or by ministryng of medicines 
do minishe the colar or blacke 
Iaundies, refreshe the feble powers of 
the herte, vnderset the spirites of the 
brayne. pourge the instrumentes of the 
mynde, mende the wyt, repayre the habitacion 
of the memorie, and chaunge 
the hole hautour of the mynde into better, 
do he nat by the outwarde man (as 
they cal it) saue also the inwarde? He y=t= 
restoreth the frantyke, the madde man. 
the lethargike, y=e= siderate, the lymphat 
do he nat restore the hole man? The diuins 
effecte and worke is, that men conuert 
them selues from vices, but the phisician 
bringeth to effecte that there may 
be one that may conuert hym selfe and 
forsake his euyl lyuyng, In vayne were 
[^f.B1r^] 
he a phisician for the soule, if the soule 
alredy be fledde, for whome the salue 
was prepared, whan the palsay, the apoplexia, 
or any other sodayne scorge 
do take a wycked man whiche disease 
wyl soner take lyfe away tha~ suffre hym 
to thynke of the amendeme~t of his lyfe 
he that restoreth this persone which els 
shulde haue ben miserably buried i~ his 
synfulnes, doth he nat i~ maner cal back 
agayne from hel both body and soule? 
Surely he setteth agayne the man i~ that 
plyght & state, y=t= now it may be in his election 
wheter he wyl flee or nat eternal 
damnation, what shall the diuine perswade 
the perso~ that raueth, or is i~ such 
takyng that his wittis & sences be clene 
taken from hym, if he can nat heare hym 
that goeth about to perswade and cou~sel 
hym? what shall the preacher or the 
curate moue the frantyke, if the phisicia~ 
do nat first of al repurge the colour? 
Charitie and the other vertues wherin 
the felicitie of a christia~ mans lyfe doth 
stande & henge chefely and principally 
of the mynde I denye nat, but bycause 
this mynde beyng so knytte and copeled 
with the body must of necessite (wyl 
[^f.B1v^] 
he or wyl he nat) vse the instrume~tes corporal, 
it cometh to passe that a good p~t 
of a good mynde doth depende vpon 
the hauour & te~perature of the body. 
[/24./] 
An vnhappy temperature of the bodye 
which we cal commonly a complexion 
(the Greakes cal it crasis or sistema) draweth 
many men to synfulnes yea in maner 
agaynst their wylles & stroggelyng 
& wrastyng agaynst it, whyle the mynde 
whiche lytteth on the horse backe gydeth 
the brydel i~ vayne, digge the spurres 
in vayne but maugre his wyl is constreyned 
to folowe heedlong the wyld 
and furious horse. I graunt it is the power 
of the mynde whiche seeth, it is the 
power of the mynde whiche seeth, it is the 
power of the mynde which heareth, but 
yet if any infirmitie take the eyes, if the 
poores and issues of the eares be stopped 
& beseged w=t= any grosse humour, i~ 
vayne & al for nought hathe the mynde 
his power. The mynde hateth, y=e= minde 
is angry I agre wel/ but yet the vitious 
& corrupte humour beseging the orga~s 
or instrumentes of the mynde is the very 
cause why thou hatest hi~ whom thou iugest 
worthy to be beloued and arte angrye 
with hym w=t= whome thou woldest 
[^f.B2r^] 
Plato confesseth the su~me & chiefe 
[/25./] 
of philosophie to co~sist and lye here in, 
if the affections obey the reason, but to 
bryng this mater about the phisician is 
the chiefe helper whose worke and labour 
it is that that parte of man shulde 
haue his strengthe and sauour by whose 
arbitrement and guidyng al thynges be 
done, whice be done wel and laudable 
If they be iudged vnworthy to bere the 
name of man whiche after the fashon of 
brute beastes be drawen and caried w=t= 
lustes and sensualities, surely than we 
owe to the phisicia~s a great parte of the 
worthynes of this name, whiche beynge 
[/26./] 
an hyghe and great thynge in priuate 
and common persons, howe moche 
more greater and nobler benefite is it 
beynge wrought in a prince. None estate 
is more encombered with suche euyls 
than the estate of moste fortunate 
and blessed kynges. what araye what 
busynes and mischife shal the corrupte 
brayne of one persone styer? In vayne 
maye they that be of his counsell crye 
oute agaynste hym, thou arte madde 
fyr kynge, come to thy selfe agayne, yf 
so be that the physycian with his crafte 
[^f.B2v^] 
restore nat his mynde and wittes agayn 
vnto him, nether it wyllyng nor felyng. 
[/27./] 
If the Emperour Caligula had had a 
trusty and faythful phisician, he shulde 
nat so with poysonynges & pryue morders 
haue raged to the great destructio~ 
of mankynde. And for this very cause 
it is come~ly vsed through out al the uacions 
of y=e= world y=t= the prince kepe nor 
abyde in no place without his phesicia~s 
[/28./] 
wherfore the wyse princes in tymes past 
haue gyuen to no scie~ce more honour or 
reuerence than vnto phisike. For Erasistratus 
(to passe ouer with silence the 
residue) neuewe by the doughters syde 
to Aristotle for the helyng of kyng Antiochus 
was rewarded with an hu~dreth 
talentes of Ptolomeo his sonne. More 
ouer also the holy escripture of god co~maundeth 
due honour to be had to the 
phisician nat onely for the profite and 
[/29./] 
vtilite which therby aryseth but also for 
the necessitie so that the ingratitude and 
vnkyndnes which is towarde other weldoers 
and weldeseruers, is agaynst the 
phisicia~ an impietie or vngodlynes, sith 
that the phisicia~ as it were the helper of 
diuine benefite saue vp and defe~de that 
[^f.B3r^] 
with his arte and scie~ce which god hath 
gyuen to ma~ moste deare and beste, that 
is to saye lyfe. we haue nothynge but 
we may thanke our father and mother 
for it, bycause by them we seme i~ maner 
to haue receyued the benefite of lyfe. 
But we owe more in my mynde to the 
phisician to whom we owe oftymes the 
thynge whiche we owe onely but ones 
to our pare~tes, if yet we owe any thyng 
at al vnto them. we owe charitie aud a 
certeyne natural zele to them which dryue 
awaye the ennemie from our necke, 
and do we nat owe moche more to the 
phisician whiche for our helth and preseruation 
fyghteth dayly with so many 
mortal & capital ennemies of our lyfe? 
we adore & worship kynges euen lyke 
goddes, bycause it is thought that they 
haue power of lyfe and deth, which yet 
although they may kyll yet surely they 
can none otherwyse gyue lyfe but in as 
moche as they bereue and take it nat away, 
euen as we say that theues do saue 
those mens lyues whome they murder 
nat, nor these princes can geue none other 
lyfe, but the lyfe of the body. But 
howe moche nerer doth the benefite of 
[^f.B3v^] 
the phisician approche to the benignite 
and goodnes of god, whiche draweth 
euen out of the mouthes of death with 
his crafte, wytte, cure, and faythfulnes 
the man which was euen now destinat & 
appoynted to the fyar of hell. In other 
thynges to profite man, we call it an humanite 
or a gentylnes, but to saue a ma~ 
euen in the very daungeer of body and 
soule is more tha~ a pietie or godlynes. 
Put here vnto, that what so euer is great 
and excellent in man, as lernyng, vertue 
the giftes of nature or what other thing 
so euer it be, of altogether we thanke y=e= 
arte of phisike, in so moche as it saueth 
and mayntayne that thyng without whiche 
we coulde nat kepe vp the residue. 
[/30./] 
If althynges be for man, and the phisician 
preserueth ma~ vndoubtedly we may 
thanke the phisician for all. If he lyueth 
nat, which lyueth accombred with diseases, 
and the phisician is he whiche restoreth & 
preserueth the prosperous helth 
is it nat co~uenie~t to recognise hi~ as the 
pare~t of lyfe? If immortalite be a thing 
greatly to be desyred & wyshed for, y=e= 
industrie of the phisicians doth (asmoch 
as may be) counterfayt it, whiche with 
[^f.B4r^] 
theyr diligence attempt to prolonge it 
so farre as is possible, for what shall I 
here recount vnto youthe comenly knowen 
exa~ples. Pythagoras/ Chr_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ppus/ 
Plato/ Cato sensorius/ Antonius/ Castor, 
& besyde these innumerable other 
of whome the moste parte by the obseruation 
and marking of phisike dyd prolonge 
theyr lyfe beyonde an hundred 
yeres without sycknes, neyther the freshnes 
of wyt endulled nor abated, nor the 
surenes and styfnes of memorie nat shaken, 
nor yet the senses brosed or enfeabled. 
I praye you is nat this to shewe 
as it were euen nowe here in this prese~t 
lyfe a certeyne spyse, represe~tacion, or 
[/31./] 
ymage of immortalitie? Also Christe 
selue hym the onely author redeamer 
and conquerour of immortalitie toke a 
body vp on hym whiche thoughe it was 
mortal, yet it was combered with no disease 
he abhorred nat the crosse but he 
abhorred diseases. And were it nat a 
fayre & a godly thynge for vs, also in 
this parte to folowe to our power our 
prince & lorde? The apostles lyued in 
maner al a long lyfe, we reade the~ beten, 
[/32./] 
we reade them slayne, but we reade 
[^f.B4v^] 
nat they were sycke. By what meanes 
so euer this thyng chaunsed vnto them, 
surely the phisicians craft parforme the 
same to vs, whiche their felicitie performed 
[/33./] 
vnto them For I count nat the~ worthy 
to be herde which no lesse vnlernedly 
than vnshamefastly ar wont to caste 
this in our tethes, Virtus in infirmitate 
perficitur. That is to say, vertue is perfited 
in infirmitie, dreaming that Paule 
was combered with greuous heedage, 
where as he calleth the infirmitie, eyther 
the temptation of the mynde, or whiche 
is nygher to the truthe the bacbytyng & 
persecution of wycked persons. But 
the same selfe Paule, amonge the apostolical 
[/34./] 
gyftes reherseth also the gyft of 
curyng or healyng. More ouer this also 
augmenteth the glorye of phisike nat a 
lytle, that aswell the maiestie of the emperours 
lawes, as the aucthoritie of poPes 
lawes do frely submit them selues 
to the iudgement of phisicians as in cases 
of nonage whiche they cal pubertie, 
in cases of chyldbyrthes, and poisonynges, 
also in certayne questions touching 
matrimonie. O a newe and straunge dignitie 
of phisike. They go vpon lyfe and 
[^f.B5r^] 
deth of a man, and the sentence of the 
iudge hengeth vpon the foreiudgeme~t 
of the phisicia~. The charitie of the pope 
whan he pardoneth any thyng, he pardoneth 
or lycensethe none otherwyse 
oneles the phesician alloweth and counselleth 
the same. Also the pope in his 
decrees, that bysshop whiche is co~playned 
vpon to haue any foule or horrible 
disease by the iudgement of phisike iugeth 
hym other to be put out of his byshopryche 
or els to be restored agayne 
to his place. Also saynt Augustin co~me~deth 
[/35./] 
al thinges to be done by y=e= aduise 
of the phisicians althoughe the pacient 
wolde nat. Also the honour whiche is 
due to the phisician that is the rewarde 
of his craft and labour the same saynt 
Augustin writteth very wel y=t= it is wro~gfully 
taken away of hym that witholde 
it, as of an iniuste possessour and occupeyng 
with an euyl conscience that which 
is an others and nat his, ye more ouer 
these persones which with certeyne oriso~s 
and prayers made to the same purpose 
dryue out of mens bodies wycked 
spirites and deuyls, ofte~tymes take phisicians 
with them to haue aduise, as in 
[^f.B5v^] 
those diseases whiche by pryuy and secrete 
meanes do marre and corrupt certeyne 
organs & instrumentes of the lenses 
and spirite and do so counterfait a 
demoniacal spice, that they can nat be 
discerned but of very connyng phisicians, 
other whether they be certayn grosser 
deuyls (as it is sayd theyr natures to 
be diuines and sundry) whiche can fele 
the cure of the phisician, or whether the 
sycknes remaineth so deaply i~ the most 
inwarde parties of the mynde that it semeth 
to be clene straunge and of an other 
nature, than the body is. In proue 
[/36./] 
and witnes of which thynge, whyle that 
I report vnto you of innumerable exa~ples 
one which I sawe & herde my selfe 
I pray you to heare me paciently. Panacens 
a phisician of an excellent and renowned 
fame floryshed whan I was a 
yonge man and was of my singular acquayntance. 
He (I present & beyng witnes) 
restored to helth a certayne person 
called Phlyarius a spoletan borne whiche 
by reason of vermyn was falle~ into 
a newe kynde of madnes in so moch y=t= 
in his sycknes he dyd speake very well 
Dutche which thyng before wha~ he was 
[^f.B6r^] 
hole (it was manifestly knowen) that he 
coulde neuer do. who nat connyng nor 
sene in phisike wolde nat styflye haue 
sworne that this man was possessed with 
some spirite? But this phisician with an 
easy and redy remedie dyd restore him, 
to his ryght mynde agayne. And wha~ he 
was ones restored agayne to hym selfe, 
he neyther coulde speke nor yet vnderstande 
the Dutche tongue. That if perchaunce 
some men wolde contend with 
me and saye that this was in dede 
possessed with a deuyl, surely this thyng 
do moste of al auance and set forth the 
noble science of the phisicians to which 
(it is manifestly proued) that the wycked 
spirites do also obey, which our noble 
science is not onely the ministre but 
also the counterfettour and folower of 
the diuine vertue and myght aswell in 
the restorynge of lyfe, as in castynge 
forthe spirites. Nor there lacked none 
whiche slau~derously reported that this 
thyng was wrought by arte magyke or 
wytchecraft, whose slaunder I do turne 
to the great glorie & prayse of our arte 
wherby those thynges are brought to 
[^f.B6v^] 
passe which the vulgare and lay people 
beleueth to passe mans powers. wherefore 
[/37./] 
nat without great & iuste causes in 
the olde worlde whan vyle gaynes and 
foule pleasures had nat as yet vitiate 
nor corrupted al to gethers, among all 
other sciences the onely art of phisike 
was chiefly regarded of the diuyne and 
moste noble men, of moste happy and 
ryche prynces, of moste renowned senatours, 
nor there was no crafte more acceptable 
to mankynde, for that great 
man Moses (as it is thought) dyd in his 
[/38./] 
lawes make distinctio~ of his meates by 
none other wysdome or pollecie tha~ by 
[/39./] 
the reason of phisike. Orpheus the most 
oldest of y=e= Grekes dyd bryng to lyght 
many thynges. (as it is read of hym) of 
[/40/] 
the natures and powers of herbes. Homere 
hym selfe which was without question 
the onely fountayne of wittes is 
moche busied both i~ the rehersal of herbes 
and in the prayse of phisicians. He 
also paynted & describeth vnto vs Moly, 
[/41./] 
of all herbes (as Plinie witnesseth) 
moste comendable whiche is good and 
effectual agaynst poysonynges, the inuention 
of whiche herbe he assigne and 
[^f.B7r^] 
attribute vnto Mercurie, with this herbe 
he armeth his wyseman vlysses agaynst 
the drynkes of the voytche Circe. The 
[/42./] 
selue same Homer sheweth y=t= Nepe~thes 
an herbe ought to be had in feastes, by 
cause it dryueth away care and heuynes 
Moreouer he reherseth and rekeneth vp 
[/43./] 
oftymes with great honoure Machaon, 
Peon, Chiron, Podalirius as excellent 
men in this faculty, by whose cure and 
handewerke he fayneth that nat onely 
the noble the dukes and princes were 
holpen, but also y=e= goddes them selues 
meanyng without doubt and signifieng 
vnto vs that the moste hyghe princes haue 
nede of the helpe and socours of the 
phisicians, and that the lyfe of them is 
in the phisicia~s hande, which in al other 
seme to haue iurisdiction & power both 
of lyfe & deth, ye what wyl ye say yf the 
selue same poet in the .xi. boke of his 
Ilias hathe renowmed and nobilitat the 
profession of this science withe the most 
hyghe and singuler commendation on that 
can be gyuen, sayng. The onely phisicia~ 
is to be had in greater pryse and reputacion 
than a great nombre of the reste 
of men, Agayne in an other place he noteth 
[^f.B7v^] 
and marketh the phisician that he 
called him lerned in al thynges, openly 
testifienge that whiche is mater in dede 
that this science do nat stande in one or 
two lernynges but in the knowlege and 
circuit of al artes, and more ouer (besyde 
the exacte witte) in the moche vre 
and experience of thynges. The great 
[/44./] 
clerke pythagoras of the yle of Samos 
to whome the people of auncient tyme 
dyd attribute a certayn diuinitie left be 
hynd him (as we reade) a noble volume 
[/45./] 
of the natures of herbes. And to passe 
ouer with silence Plato, Aristotle, Theophrast, 
Chrisippe, Cato Censorius, and 
Varro, whose studie it was to intermeddel 
this science other with theyr great 
studies or els with theyr great payne & 
businesses, surly Mithridates king of Po~thus 
was nat so greatly renowmed neyther 
by his realme thoughe it were neuer 
so ryche, nor by the wo~derful knowlege 
of the .xxi. strau~ge languages whiche 
he both vnderstode & coulde speke 
as he was by the knowlege and experience 
of phisike, which thynge declared 
hym a great man in dede, whiche noble 
kynge (Plinie beynge myn authour) left 
[^f.B8r^] 
in writtynge commentaries, examplars 
and experiences or effectes of this science. 
By whose name yea euen nowe at 
this daye there is a soueraygne kynde 
of triacle named. Now comenly it is 
cou~ted a princely pastime and mete for 
a noble kynge to playe at dyse, to hunt, 
[/46./] 
to do trifels. But in tymes passed to 
the princes and rulers of the people of 
Kome nothynge was regarded & more 
theyr care than to further the arte and 
science of phisike with bryngyng home 
newe and straunge herbes out of farre 
countrees, nor to that people whiche 
at that tyme hadde the dominion of al 
the worlde there was no maner of gyft, 
[/47./] 
no maner reward is more welcome and 
more acceptable, yea what that Christe 
hym selue the authour and prince of al 
disciplines and teachynges professeth 
hym selfe to be nat a great doctour or 
a great counsellour of the lawe, nat a 
great Rhetorician, nat a great Philosopher, 
but a great phisician, whyles wha~ 
he speaketh of him selfe sayth that they 
haue no neade of a phisician whiche be 
in helthe, and whyles he resemblynge 
hym selfe vnto a Samaritan poureth 
[^f.B8v^] 
oyle and wyne into the woundes, and 
whyles he temperyng the erth with his 
spytel, sprede it on y=e= eyes of the blind 
[/48./] 
man, what that the selfe same Christe 
chiefly by this commendation what tyme 
he was as yet vnknowe~ to the world 
dyd by lytle and lytle wynde him selfe 
into the myndes and affections of men, 
nat with gold; nat with empyrs, but w=t= 
the remedies of sycknesses. The thynge 
that he dyd with a beck, or with a word 
of his mouth, the same the phisicia~ doth 
to his power counterfait and foloweth 
Nor there lacketh neyther to those remedies 
and medicines a diuyne power 
and vertue, for the operatio~s & strenghtes 
of healyng is euen from god to this 
very purpos and intent geuen to thynges. 
Nor he hath instructed the apostles 
with none other viauger more than with 
the gyft of healyng, comaundyng them 
that forthwith with this deserte and benefite 
they shulde wynne the fauoure of 
theyr ost that logeth them, healyng (q~ 
he) theyr infirmities and diseases and anoyntyng 
[/49./] 
the sycke with oyle. That 
great man Paule wha~ he counselleth his 
disciple Timothie to take a lytle quantite 
[^f.C1r^] 
of wyne to stablyshe his stomake & 
the feblenes of his, doth he nat 
openly take vpon hym the partes of a 
phisician? But what wonderful thyng is 
this in the apostle, syth the aungell Raphael 
[/50./] 
healynge the blyndnes of Tobie 
gote hereby also his name amonge the 
writters and studentes of diuine thynges? 
O howe heuenly and ryght holy is 
this science, of whiche the heuenly myndes 
[/51./] 
haue their dominatio~? Among mortall 
people some studie & professe one 
science, some an other, but only this science 
ought to be studied of al, syth it is 
necessarie to al. But alas alas y=e= croked 
and peruerse iugementes of me~. No ma~ 
can abyde to be ignorant of coyne, whiche 
is currant and lawful and whiche is 
vnlawful or cou~terfait, lest they myght 
perchau~ce be deceyued in a thyng most 
vyle and of lytle importau~ce, but they 
wyl nat study to knowe by what skylles 
and meanes they may preserue that whiche 
is the best thyng that they haue. In 
money they beleue nat other mens eyes. 
In the mater of lyfe and helthe do they 
blynfelde (as they cal it) folowe other 
mens iudgeme~tes? That if the absolute 
[^f.C1v^] 
and parfite knowlege of the hole scie~ce 
[/52./] 
can nat chaunce but vnto a fewe whiche 
haue appoynted and as I myght say dedicate 
theyr hole lyfe to this onely studie, 
at lest it were mete and conuenient 
that of that parte of phisike whiche apperteyneth 
to the gouernaunce and preseruation 
of helth no persone shuld be 
ignoraunt. Although to say the trouthe 
a great part of the difficultie & hardnes 
cometh nat of the very science but other 
of the bungerlynes and blynde ignorance, 
or els of the vayne glorie & ambition 
of leude phisicia~s. Alwayes ye amonge 
the wylde and barbarous nations 
the name of amitie hath ben cou~ted 
holy and honorable, and he is take~ for 
a singuler and sure frende which is a co~paignon 
and a felowe both in prosperite 
and in aduersitie because y=t= the co~mune 
sort of frencies, lyke as swalowes 
[/53./] 
in somer, so they in welth & prosperite 
be present and at hande, but in aduersitie, 
lyke as the sayd swalowes agaynste 
the co~myng of wynter flye away. But 
[/54./] 
howe moche more sure & substanciall a 
frende is the phisician whiche (after the 
example of certeyne byrdes whiche be 
called Seleucides which as they say can 
[^f.C2r^] 
no where be espied of the inhabitantes 
of the mountayne of Casius but whan 
they nede theyr socure & helpe agaynst 
the violence and power of great butterflyes 
destroyng theyr corues/ whan all 
thynges be wel and saufe he neuer putteth 
hym selfe in peryl, but in suche casualties 
in whiche both the wyfe & the 
children oftentymes forsaketh the man 
as in the fransie, the lowly euyl (whiche 
is called Phthiriasis) and the pestilence 
the phisician onely is constantly prese~t 
and he is present nat with an vnprofitable 
seruice, as the moste part of the reste 
but he is prese~t to helpe, he is prese~t to 
fyght w=t= the sycknes for lyfe & deth of 
his patie~t, & y=t= many times putting his 
owne lyfe i~ ieopardy. And O more tha~ 
vnkynde psons which preserued by the 
seruice of such a frend can fynd i~ their 
hertes wha~ the ieopardy is now driue~ a 
way to hate the phisicia~ & do nat rather 
reuere~ce & worship hi~ in stede of a parente 
A co~men frend y=t= bideth the~ good 
morow, or good eue~ so oft as they mete 
hi~, is for his kynd salutatio~ called to super, 
he y=t= taketh the~ curtesly by y=e= arme 
hym they recompe~ce w=t= lyke kyndnes, 
[^f.C2v^] 
and wyl they shake of suche frende wha~ 
they leue neadyng of hym? and for this 
very cause shake hym of, bycause they 
p~ceyue that they be nat able (were they 
neuer so ryche) to yelde due thankes vnto 
his kynde deseruynges? That if he is 
the beste man which moste profite the co~men 
weale, than surely he that coueteth 
to be best ought pri~cipaly to study this 
facultie. But nowe if ther be any of this 
[/55./] 
appetite which had rather measure the 
prisel of thynges w=t= profite & gaynage 
(albe it this arte is more hyghe & more 
diuine, than that it shuld be estemed by 
suche reasons) yet I say if ther be any of 
that apetite whiche regarde lucre & gaines, 
this art wyl gyue place to none other 
science neyther in this behalfe, for 
ther was neuer none more fruteful, and 
auaylable, and so redy a craft to get ryches 
sode~ly as this. Erasistratus of who~ 
[/56./] 
I made mencion before was as we rede 
in Cronicles rewarded of kynge Ptolome 
and also Critobulus an other phisician 
was rewarded of Alexander the 
[/57./] 
great, with ryche and in maner incredible 
gyftes, howe be it what rewarde can 
nat but seme to lytle whiceh is gyuen to 
[^f.C3r^] 
the sauiour of the lyfe of him for whose 
onely lyfe so many thousandes of men 
dyd put theyr bodies and lyfes in ieopardie? 
what shulde I nowe make rehersal 
of other noble phisicians, as of the 
Cassians, the Caipitans, the Arunkens, y=e= 
Albutis, of whome Plinie writteth that 
they had vnmeasurable gaynes in Rhome 
aswel with y=e= prince and emperour 
as w=t= the people. How be it what serch 
we these histories out of olde tymes, as 
thoughe at this day euery man can nat 
remembre ynoughe whom this science 
hath brought vp to ryches aboue the ryches 
of Cresus? Rhetorike, or poetrie, 
fynde none oneles he be excellent. The 
musician excepte he be passyng co~nyng 
he hath but a cold supper. The man of 
lawe hath thyne gaynes if he be nat depely 
and profundly studied. Onely phisike 
[/58./] 
fyndeth and supporteth hym whiche 
is but so so lerned. Phisike consist in 
innumerable disciplins, and in infinite 
knowlege of thynges, and yet it is ofte~ 
sene that one or two medicines or remedies 
shal fynde a fole that haue no lernyng 
at al. So that in no wyse this art ca~ 
be condempned of barennes. Put this 
[^f.C3v^] 
to y=t= of other crafts ther is no redy gaynes 
[/59./] 
in euery place. The Khetoritia~ may 
blowe his nayles among the Sermates. 
The Ciuil law is nat so hyghly estemed 
in England. But the phisician whether 
so euer he goeth in what partes of the 
worlde so euer he kepeth hath his honour 
& worship, his viauger foloweth 
hym. So that also the comune prouerbe 
of the Grekes can be applied better vp 
[/60./] 
on no science than it is vpon this, 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] 
Fhe craftesma~ getteth his lyuyng where 
[/61./] 
euer he goeth. But plinie or surly other 
y=t= Plinie speketh of, take great indignatio~ 
and be hyghly disco~tented y=t= the 
profession of phisike shuld be a gaynes 
& a lucre. I graunt, this facultie is greater 
tha~ y=t= it shuld be subiecte & seruiable 
to lucre & gaynes, I graunt it is for 
vyle occupations to serue for gaynes. 
But agayne on y=e= other syde how great 
an ingratitude, what an vnkyndnes wer 
it to do fraude and depriue this science 
onely of his mede to whiche no due not 
sufficie~t mede can be requited? A noble 
phisician euen lyke a certeyn god wyll 
[^f.C4r^] 
saue frely without rewarde, he wyl saue 
yea them that be vnwillyng to be saued 
but agayne it is an impietie and an vngodlynes 
nat to considre and acknowlege 
the benifite of the godly person. 
He lytle passe on thy rewarde, but yet 
thou art worthy to be punyshed by the 
lawes for thy notable ingratitude. But 
yet this natwithsta~dyng I knowe ryght 
wel that this noble sciece hath ben euyl 
spoken of both in tymes passed among 
the olde fathers, and also nowe at this 
day is euyl defamed among certeyn vnlerned 
p~sons. This art plesed nat Cato 
[/62./] 
nat because he damned the very thyng, 
but that he coulde nat abyde the vayne 
glorious profession of the Greakes, beyng 
hym selfe a mere Rhomane. And he 
gaue so moche to experie~ce, y=t= he wold 
nat haue it a science. But the selfe same 
Cato iudged it expedient that all the 
philosophie of the Crekes were vtterly 
expelled and banyshed the citie, for y=e= 
grosse and hard man thought that brassica 
and ofte vomites dyd suffice to purge 
mans body, and yet he hym selfe so 
styffe an ennemy of phisicians by the obseruation 
& kepyng of phisike dyd (as 
[^f.C4v^] 
it is written of him) preserue his myght 
and strengthe hole and sounde euen vnto 
his very extreme age. Also y=e= rude & 
vnlerned people cast in our tethe, that 
the phisicians ar licensed without punisheme~tes 
to kyl me~. Mary for this cause 
the rather good phisicians ar to be magnified 
[/63./] 
and hyghly co~me~ded which wher 
as it is in their hande nat onely without 
punishme~t but also w=t= mede to kyl, yet 
they had rather saue. That they may, it 
is a power, that they wyl nat, it is theyr 
goodnes. It is recited now in euery place 
at ale houses & tauernes among dro~kardes 
[/64./] 
this prouerbe. Qui medice viuit 
misere viuit. He that lyueth after the 
rules of phisike lyueth wretchedly. As 
thoughe it were an happynes and felicitie, 
the body to be swolen and stretched 
out with surfettyng, to be brasted 
witk the pleasure of the body, to waxe 
foggyshe with drinkyng of good ale, & 
to be sepulte and drowned in slepe. But 
these Sycopha~tes and bakbyters what 
nedeth it to refel with my oration, syth 
they them selues paye sufficient penalties 
to our art for their skoldyng, beyng 
sone after wrested with y=e= gout, amased 
[^f.C5r^] 
with the palsay, dotynge and lackynge 
theyr wittes before the due tyme, waxyng 
blynde and blereyed before age, 
and tha~ at last beyng i~ this wretchednes 
they rechaunt and synge a newe songe 
praysing (as Stesichorus dyd) but al to 
late phisyke whiche before they dyspraysed. 
And yet to these persones 
though they be most vnworthy, y=e= goodnes 
of the art dysdayneth not to lay to, 
her helpyng hande, and to socour them 
as moch as in her is. There be som maligners 
[/65./] 
also whiche borowyng a tawnt 
out of y=t= old comedie called phisicia~s, 
scatophagos, that is to say, deuowrers 
of turdes. As though for this very cause 
they deserued not chyefly to be praysed 
which to the entente they wolde secoure 
and helpe the miseries and calamities 
of men, are contented from theyr hyghnes 
and sublimitie to humble themselfes 
vnto these so vyle seruices, but if the 
phisicians were as scornfull and dysdaynfull 
as these be ful of skoldyng & 
raylyng, they myght on euery syde dye 
apace without controllyng. But our art 
hathe this one thyng co~mune with good 
kynges, that it doth good and hathe an 
[^f.C5v^] 
euyl name. And though there were most 
of al (as there be) in this sort and kynd 
of men, whiche beare them selues for 
[/66./] 
phisicians whiche be nothynge lesse tha~ 
phisicians, if there be whiche for remedies 
ministre poysons, if therbe whiche 
for gaynes or vayne glorie do counsell 
theyr syck patie~tes amisse, what is more 
agaynst al reason & equitie tha~ to wrest 
and detort the vices of men to the slau~der 
of the science? Ther be also among 
prestes auowterers and euyl lyuers, ther 
be among fryers, monkes, and other religious 
persons murderers, ma~quellers 
and pyrates, but what is this to the religion 
whiche is of it selfe the best thynge 
that can be deuised of ma~? There is no 
profession so holy but that nourysheth 
a sort of naughty packes and vngracious 
felowes. It is a thynge with all vowes 
to be wyshed, that al rulers & princes 
were suche as becometh, them to be 
whiche be thought worthy of this name 
but yet nat because of this is the office 
of a prince to be a damned, that some vnder 
that tytle playe the pyllers, tyrantes, 
an ennemies of the co~mune welthe. 
I wolde wyshe also my selfe that al the 
[^f.C6r^] 
phisicians were, truely phisicians and 
that the greake prouerbe had no place 
[/67./] 
in them. [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
Many dyuers of the oxe, but fewe plowers 
of the erthe. I wold wyshe y=t= that 
holynes and purenes were perfourmed 
of al phisicians which the moste worthy 
phisician Hippocrates requireth of his 
[/68./] 
scolers whome he sware with a sole~pne 
othe. But yet we ought to endeuour our 
selues vnto it, althoughe we se it nat perfourmed 
of the moste part of them that 
professe this science. But because (O 
[/69./] 
ryght worthy audience) the cause which 
I nowe plede hath so great plentie and 
copie of mater in it, that it is very hard 
to fynde an ende of speakynge, leste I 
shulde nat perfourme that I promised 
in the begynnyng I thynke it nowe due 
tyme to gather to gether i~ a grosse su~me 
all the prayses of it. For if so be many 
thynges are commendable onely by 
reason of antiquitie, than surely this 
arte or science was founde, fyrste of al 
[^f.C6v^] 
other, euen for very necessitie. If the science 
be made the noblear by reason of 
the first authours and inuentours and inuentours 
of it, this science was euer thought 
to be inuented of goddes. If honour 
addeth any authoritie, no other science 
hath deserued diuine honours so 
vniuersally and so longe tyme. If those 
thynges be of great reputacion whiche 
be regarded and allowed of most hygh 
men/ this studie hath nat onely delyted 
but also renowmed and auanced moste 
[/70./] 
hygh kynges & potestates. If those thinges 
that be herde, be also fayre and godly/ 
there is nothing more buysy more laborious 
than this, whiche rested i~ so many 
disciplines and in the serchyng out 
and the experience of so many thynges 
If we estyme the thynge by the worthynes 
and dignitie therof/ what thynge is 
more excellent than that, whiche goeth 
more nyghe to the bounty of god? If by 
the faculty and power, what thyng is of 
more myght and strength/ than to haue 
the power restore agayne the hole man 
to hym selfe whiche els shulde certenly 
haue dyed? If we mesure the thynge by 
necessitie/ what is so necessarie as that. 
[^f.C7r^] 
without whiche we can nother lyue nor 
be borne? if by the vertue, what is more 
honeste, than to saue mankynde? If by 
the vtilite & profite, the vse of nothyng 
is neyther greater nor wyther. If by the 
gaynes and auauntage, other this scie~ce 
muste nedes brynge in great lucre and 
ryches, or els men be very vnkynde, 
[/71./] 
wherfore for your causes I greately reioyse 
(o moste excellent and famous in 
this science? whome it hath chaunced to 
excel i~ this moste goodly kynde of profession. 
[/72./] 
And you (yonge men) I exhorte 
this science to loue & embrace with al 
your brestes, v[^Inverted letter.^]pon this set your studies 
with all the veynes of your bodies, whiche 
shal bryng vnto you renowme glorie, 
authoritie, ryches/ by whiche ye agayne 
on your parte shal bryng to your 
frendes, to your natiue contre, ye 
and ta al mankynde no smal 
profite and vtilite, I 
haue spoken. 
Thus endeth the declamation of 
Erasmus in prayse and commendation 
of Phisike.
