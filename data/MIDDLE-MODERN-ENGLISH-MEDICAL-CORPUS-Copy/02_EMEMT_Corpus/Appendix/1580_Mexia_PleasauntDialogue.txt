[}Interlocutores. 
Iasper, Bernardo, Don 
Nunio, Master Velasques.}] 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
IT should seeme, that 
we espyed the one the 
other, by our comming 
out, and meeting at one 
season. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Now truely you say 
well. But whether wander you. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
If you commaund not other wayes: I 
was determined to goe visite Don Nunio, 
and to keepe him company for one 
howre, for as yet he is weake of his infirmitie 
past, and goeth not out of hys 
doores. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
By my troth, and I came from home 
with the same intent. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
Many times it doth so happen, the will 
[^f.A5v^] 
of two men to moue vnto one thing, being 
a sunder in diuers places, yea & the 
one to remember the other, at one instant 
in such wise: that it shoulde seeme 
the mindes to vnderstand eche other. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
By the spirituall partes, it is no maruell 
though in some thing wee are like 
Angels: who vnderstand without speaking, 
and communicate their conceytes 
the one with the other. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
How so euer it be, sith God mooued vs 
both at one time to meete, in a good howre 
be it, and let vs goe together to make our 
visitation. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Let vs goe through the next streete for 
this is pestered, with the Marchauntes 
workes. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
You say well, but looke what a fayre 
fronte he hath buylt to his house, certenly 
of late the building in this Cittie of 
Ciuil is greatly mended, for within these 
ten yeeres, their buildings are most bewtifull 
toward the streete, with many faire 
wyndowes of diuers fashions. 
 
[^f.A6r^] 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Troth it is, ye and manye auncient 
houses are reedified, and although euery 
one can not doe as he would: yet truely y=e= 
amendment is great. But in one thyng 
I see it not, and that is, in their low buildings, 
for very fewe builde higher then 
one story, whervpon the houses remaine 
moyst and of small maiestie. And therefore 
straungers which come from Barselona, 
and other Citties where their buildings 
are of three stories high: can not away 
with ours, nor yet the buyldings of 
this Cittie content them. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
You say troth, but it were not wisedome 
to comply with bewty and brauerie, 
and to commit notorious hurt, bothe 
to health and life, in this countrey it is 
not conuenient to build high, and it hath 
been bothe aduise, & discretion, not to doo 
so, for naturally the situation of this Citie 
is hot and moyst. and to resist y=e= heate 
is a principall remedy, the ayre is fresh, 
which ordinarily runneth in the Sommer, 
it is therefore needefull that y=e= houses 
be open, & not very high, to be visited 
with the ayre, and for this cause our auncestors 
[^f.A6v^] 
vsed this building, for certainly 
the high buildings are more hotter than 
the low, and more vnholsome in Sommer 
season for want of aire, as we know 
some that are troubled with this defect, 
also it is necessarie in this place, the Edifices 
to be lowe, for remedie of the great 
moysture, that both streetes and houses 
may be visited of the sunne and the ayre, 
so that if the houses and Edifices heere in 
this Cittie were high: they shoulde be 
more cold & moyst in wynter, and more 
hotter in Sommer. By meane whereof 
very vnholsome, for the moysture is so 
great that alwayes wee must procure 
that the sunne haue entraunce into all 
places of our houses, if it were possible al 
day long, the which could not be if the 
houses and lodgings were high. And also 
the cold here is not so great to consume 
the moysture, as it is in Castillia & other 
partes, and where great cold is: yet the 
heate of the sunne is necessarie, although 
in Sommer it be great, to consume the 
ouer much moysture. And therefore I 
beleeue that our forefathers vsed to this 
ende, to make the streetes brode, as nowe 
the most are, yea and in our daies, shades 
[^f.A7r^] 
and penthouses were commaunded to be 
taken away for that purpose, where by a 
notorious commoditie and health hath 
followed: 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Truely your reason is certaine and 
naturall, & although some times I haue 
mused thereon, yet I was neuer so well 
satisfied as now I am: and I thinke hytherto, 
the same respect hath bene, and if 
it had not, it is iust that it be heereafter. 
But it seemeth vnto me, that high Cha~bers 
are not good lodging, nor yet needful 
for this place in the winter, which is not 
colde, and the heate of Summer exceeding 
hote. As for experience, noble men 
which haue high houses, doo seldome dwel 
in them, for those causes alleadged: but 
rather keepe them to lay corne in, and for 
lodging of their seruauntes, rather then 
for other purpose, although in Castillia 
such high buyldings are most holsome: so 
y=t= our houses beeing lowe: the cause was 
not for want of knowledge: but rather 
came of a good foresight. Let vs now see 
howe Don Nunio will buylde his house, 
which hath a good beginning, & heere I see 
[^f.A7v^] 
much stuffe prepared for the woorke. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
Let vs vnderstand what he dooth before 
we alight from our Moyles: for sick 
persons may not be visited at all seasons. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
No but yet it seemeth by yonder Moile 
that Maister Velasques is with him: 
therefore let vs alight, and I will leade 
the waye. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
[/1./] 
God giue your Woorship health. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
- I kisse your Maistershippes hand, 
and am very glad that ye are comen at 
such time, to fynde Maister Docter Velasques 
heere, for if ye two will speake 
Latin he will vnderstand ye, or els if ye 
will argue any matter (as ye were wont 
to doo) yee haue a good and present 
Iudge. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
No sir, for now we come very conformable 
like good neighbours, and we 
haue not wherevpon to Dispute, if you 
throwe not in a bone as you were wont 
to doo. 
 
[}Maister.}] 
 
Senor Don Nunio, Dooth not euill 
[^f.A8r^] 
therein. For alwayes good fruite proproceedes 
out of a good discorde. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
At the least sir you haue small neede 
thereof: for it is euident that you teach 
vs all. But notwithstanding our talke, 
sir, how doo you feele your seife. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
Truely as yet I am very weake, for 
my disease principally hath beene of a 
long continuance, and also I was letten 
bloud three times, therefore I cannot so 
soone recouer strength, and I haue also 
an exceeding drines, remayning in my 
mouthe so that I cannot abstaine from 
drinking, and thinking my selfe neuer 
satisfied, and surely I beleeue that the 
Phisitions hath not vnderstood the secretes 
of my disease, to cure it accordingly 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Sir beleeue me I know a man that 
would not be offended with the drines 
you speake of, for on a time the same man 
hauing an exceeding burning feauer and 
drynes. The Phisission would haue giuen 
him certaine thinges to myttigate 
the heate and drought: vnto whom he 
[^f.A8v^] 
[/2./] 
aunswered very grauely, 
Maister Doctor, I pray you doo what you 
can to ease my extreeme heate. But as 
for my thyrstinesse, I would be contented 
to remayne with all. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
Yea, but I am not so great a freend of 
drinke: for when I am in health, I flee 
from the thinges that should cause thyrstinesse. 
But truly the extreeme drinesse 
which I haue now, came of a Purgation 
that was giuen me. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
Yea, and therefore I defie Phisitions, 
for I promise you, if you had not purged 
your self: you had bene sooner whole, and 
not now so weake, 
 
[}Maister.}] 
 
Why syr, the Phisitions know no better 
way to cure. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
Mary syr, and that way, I would they 
knew not, for it is not conuenient to be 
vsed. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
If ye had seene what a disputation heere 
was, about what should be giue~ to purge 
[^f.B1r^] 
me with all, and about the letting of me 
blood, ye would haue sayde somwhat. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
Syr, I needed not to see the thing, for I 
haue other causes more sufficient, to approoue 
that which I meane to speake of: 
Long agone I knewe howe the Phisitions 
very seldome agree in their opinio~s, 
yea, and I was about to say, that fewer 
tymes they happen to doo y=e= patient good. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Then must I say also, that you haue 
for a custome, seldome tymes to speake 
well, either of Aduocates or Phisitions. 
[/3./] 
But say what you lyst, you shall, will or 
nill, trust the one with your life, and the 
other with your goodes. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
Then accursed be I, if I doo so, at the 
least, to put my lyfe in the Phisitions 
handes, for in all my life tyme hytherto, 
I was neuer let blood, nor yet haue had 
any Phisitions counsell, as long as I 
haue gone abroade in the world. And I 
finde my selfe better in health, and more 
sounder then you, who alwayes hath to 
doo with such kinde of men. 
 
[^f.B1v^] 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Yea and therfore you brag, but I promise 
you, if any disease should take you 
vehemently: you would then crye out 
for the Phisitions. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
It might so be, that y=e= infirmitie might 
be such to depriue me of my witte, and so 
to demaund helpe of Phisitions, but as 
long as my memorie serueth, feare not 
that I commit any such madnesse: for sithens 
God be praysed I haue lyued 45. 
yeeres without them, yea, and haue bene 
holpen of some infirmities, with holsom 
dyet & good regiment: I meane not now 
to prooue new inuentions. 
 
[}Dun Nunio.}] 
 
Now truly Signor Maister, this fire beginneth 
to kindle, for these Gentlemen 
are armed for the purpose. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
I am not disposed to contend. But yet 
I will alwayes defend the trueth. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
And the same shall neuer want vnto 
me, therefore if you haue any thing to 
say, begin when you lyst, for I am ready 
[^f.B2r^] 
to aunswere. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
Truly Signor Iasper, it seemeth a merry 
toy, to call medicine a new inuencio~, being 
as you know the most auncient Art 
in the world, approoued and admitted by 
God him selfe, & by men. Haue you not 
read in Ecclesiastes, that God created medicine 
of the earth, & that the Wise man 
should not flee from it, for the medicine 
dooth exalt & honour the Phisition, & for 
medicine he shall be praysed in prese~ce of 
Kings & mighty men. Also our Aucthors 
and humane woorks, maketh no lesse accoumpt 
of medicine, although they differ 
in whom was the inuenter thereof, yet 
all agreeth to reuere~ce & honour all such. 
Some say & holde opinio~, that Mercurie 
was the first, others say Apis, other affirme 
Apollo, & some Æsculapius: Homero 
was also honored for a God, & fountaine 
of good writers, in many places, he I say 
commends medicine: yea, & did not let to 
shew, & name medicinall hearbes, & how 
medicin hath ben esteemed of Emperors 
and kings, you know better then I. You 
haue also read what reward Alexander 
[^f.B2v^] 
the great gaue vnto Aristouolus Phisitio~: 
and king Ptolome to Erasistrato. Yea, & the 
incredible stipend & fees which they had 
in y=e= tyme of Emperors in Rome, wherof 
Plinie and others make mencion: In 
conclusion, looke what a treasure health 
is, which passeth all worldly ioyes, the 
felicitie of the soule excepted: yea, and 
contrary wise, howe bitter is infirmitie. 
So that these thinges considered, you 
may see what honour is due to medicine, 
that conserueth vs in the one, & keepeth 
vs from the other. 
 
[}Maister.}] 
 
Although it hath not bene much which 
Signor Bernardo hath spoken, yet his study 
hath not bene small, as appeareth by 
his explication. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
You haue played the good Retorician, 
and sithens you haue taken the payne, I 
will doo the lyke. But I would first you 
should vnderstand, that I co~dempne not 
the good Medicine: for I tolde you that I 
had cured my selfe, with only good dyet, 
and regiment, yea, and also with some 
hearbes, and other thinges whereof I 
[^f.B3r^] 
haue experience. But I condempne the 
euyll Phisitions, who long agone made 
bothe Arte and Merchandize, inuenting 
and seeking straunge and violent medicaments, 
fylling & darkning, with their 
opinions and Cawtelles, the faculties 
which most cleere and simply ought to 
be, and of him selfe is and was in his beginning, 
when men cured one another 
for charity, and not for interest, and then 
they cured with hearbes and vertuous 
symples experimented, and not with venomous 
compositions that nowe are vsed, 
which you knowe not what they be, 
nor from whe~ce they come, nor to what 
vse they serue, nor yet howe many they 
be, because they are so many that they 
are out of number. 
 
The Medicine which is commended in 
Ecclesiastes, is the same that was vsed in 
those good dayes. But the Medicine inuented 
by those which you say were holden 
for Goddes, because they discouered 
the vertue & propertie of hearbes, stones 
fruites, and other thinges applyed them, 
to the Passions, sores, and infirmities, 
without making them Artes, rules, and 
[^f.B3v^] 
preceptes, as afterward mallice & couetousnesse 
of men brought to passe, so that 
before that time, we fou~d nothing written 
of medicine. Hipocrates by aucthority 
of Marcus Varro, according vnto Plinie 
affirmeth: was the first that wrote the 
precepts of medicine. The space of 600. 
yeeres, the Romaines defended them selues 
from Phisitions, and would in no 
wise suffer them in Rome: since which 
tyme they neuer lyued so sound. True it 
is, that in the tyme when Enullius, and 
Marcus Libio were Consuls, which was 
after the foundation of Rome .535 yeeres: 
I know not by whome perswaded, they 
admitted a Greeke Phisition Pelopones, 
called Archagatus, vnto whome they 
gaue a house & publique stipend, and as a 
new thing at the beginning, he pleased 
some men. But after they had experience 
of his letting blood, and his Cauteries, 
with strange inuencions of curing: 
bothe he and others that were newlye 
come, were banished, by the aucthoritie 
and counsell of the great Cato Censorinus, 
who lyued .85. yeeres, because you 
may consider what want he had of Archagatus, 
[^f.B4r^] 
or of any other. After Cato his 
death, the tyme running with couetousnesse, 
ambicion, and other vices, then 
entred Phisitions into Rome. 
So that it plainly appeareth, before that 
time the Romaines had, dyet, medicines, 
and a way to cure with all, according to 
experience, without vsing any tyranny, 
for each neyghbour shewed vnto other, 
the thinges that he had prooued: in those 
dayes I say, looue and charitie cured, and 
not couetousnesse and poyson. 
 
The Romaines only vsed not this good 
order, but also the Babilonians, who 
were learned. Estrabo, and Herodotus, 
wryte that, they had not knowen Phisitions, 
and therefore they vsed (when 
any happened to be sicke) to bring him 
foorth into the open streete, because his 
neighbours and freendes (who had any 
experience in such diseases) should giue 
their councell and aduise. 
 
The selfe same order was vsed among 
the Egiptians and Portyngalles, 
after those golden dayes, Signor Bernardo, 
Phisitions crepte into the houses of 
[^f.B4v^] 
Emperors & Kings, among whom, some 
were famous, as Hipocrates, who was 
the fountaine and father of them all, and 
after him came Aristogenes into seruice 
with king Antigonus of Macedonia, and 
Asclepiades his familliar, who was 
freend of great Pompeius. Antonius Muga 
was entertained of the Emperour Octauianus. 
Also bothe the Appollodors, of 
whome Plinie wryteth: Cornelio Celso the 
Romaine: the famous Erasistratus who 
by his singuler knowledge, vnderstoode 
howe the disease of Antiochus was vndecent 
looue, with his Mother in Lawe. 
Also Galenus, who now is honoured, and 
called Prince of Phisitions, with many 
other which now I will not name. But 
this I knowe, notwithstanding, that after 
Phisitions began to multiply, mans 
lyfe began to shorten. And in those dayes 
the auncient Romaines, lyued in more 
health then all these Princes, who entertayned 
the Phisitions with wages, 
and other excessiue rewardes: And if you 
will not beleeue me, let Alexander the 
great, who you brought for an example, 
say his opinion, for he lyued not full fortie 
[^f.B5r^] 
yeeres. Let also the olde gray bearded 
men of the Mountaynes and Uillages, 
which neuer knewe Phisitions, speake 
their minde. And let the young men of 
the Cittie, declare also their opinions. 
But doo you know what was the cause 
to admit Phisitions in Rome, the great 
disorder whereof I spake, because men 
would not temper, and cure them selues 
according to y=e= rule of theyr Auncestors, 
they woulde needes giue the charge of 
theyr health to them that knew it not. 
Wherevpon, as Plinie affyrmeth, great 
hurt followed to the health of man: for 
why, they left the care of them selues, 
and gaue credite to Phisitions for theyr 
health: and the Phisitio~s for theyr part, 
cared no more but for the interest & profit, 
exalting theyr Arte, and making therof 
Merchandize, yea, and to giue a more 
comely visage to theyr newe Science, 
that none might know the secretes therof: 
they began to flee from common and 
true remedies, and to vse compoundes, 
mixtures, fruites, rootes, hearbes, neuer 
before seene nor heard of, to deceaue and 
bewitch the people, with the names and 
[^f.B5v^] 
hydden properties, and for the common 
remedies, they sought straunge, casting 
cleane asyde the true way, and sticked 
fast to their new deuises. Heere also began 
the distylling of Waters, bothe of 
cleane and filthy thinges. Heere began 
Syrrups, bothe sweete and sower, some 
cleere, some darcke, made of such conceytes, 
that the Diuell him selfe would 
scarcely imagine what thing it were. 
An other deuise also, is to cause vs to 
eate golde, stones, yea, and yron, lyke 
vnto Oystrages against all nature. Heere 
also began your Mytradate, and compound 
Treacle, made of aboue 54. things 
and some of them rancke poyson: if euerie 
of them were good of him selfe, the 
incomportable company of the one with 
the other, maketh an horrible poyson. 
 
The which Plinie almost 1800. yeeres 
past, sayth, was made by ostentation 
and apparaunce of his Arte, for it is impossible 
Nature to be seene, nor experience 
knowen, nor the temper and concordaunces 
of so many thinges dyscordant, 
no it can not be. So that of these 
thinges and other lyke, they haue made 
[^f.B6r^] 
experience in mans body, with such audacitie, 
and at all aduentures. So that 
in lew of giuing health: they happen 
many tymes to kyll the patient, yea, and 
in recompence thereof, to haue his money 
for their labour: and that which 
wurst is, there is no punishment for 
them. Tell me I pray you, what Phisition 
haue you seene chastened, eyther for 
the death, or laming of any man? 
 
Finally, Signor Bernardo, the mallice 
of man hath spoyled the best thing in the 
worlde, which is in making the thing 
naturall, an obscure Artificer: charitie 
an interest, mercie, couetousnesse, darckening 
reason so much, as though none 
could cure but Phisitions. 
 
Iesting at common experience, and 
extolling with perswasion theyr Arte, 
or Mysterie, yea, euen to the names 
of thinges, giuing them newe barbarous 
and straunge tearmes, saying, both 
the Greeke and Latin names are well 
knowen. 
 
Also in theyr writing they haue inuented 
Carraters and Sygnes, not to be 
vnderstoode, but of whome they deale 
[^f.B6v^] 
withall for theyr Drugges: so that they 
procured by all meanes to darcken the 
thing which ought to be common, and 
knowen of all men. 
 
Then what shall I say of the diuersity 
of theyr doctrine and opinions. The Alarbes 
differ from the Greekes, so that among 
them selues, they are not conformable, 
neyther the one nor the other. 
The order and manner of curing theyr 
Auicena, differeth from Galenus, & those 
of antiquitie, euen so much that it seemeth 
an other thing: nor yet those of our 
tyme cure lyke Auicena, nor lyke the other, 
for now all consisteth in inuencio~s 
and opinions. Yea, if you call two or 
three together, you shall finde each to be 
singuler in his iudgement. But when 
they agree, iwis it is to the great peryll 
of the Patient: if you heare each of them 
by him selfe it is a myracle to finde them 
conformable, yea, & theyr receytes shall 
be diuers and contrarie each to other: It 
shall not neede that I make any further 
recytall therof, for dayly you see it before 
your eyes, therefore I will not wearie 
my selfe in the rehearsall. 
 
[^f.B7r^] 
[}Maister Velasques.}] 
 
It should seeme that these Gentlemen 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ame purposely to debate this matter, & 
heerein to shewe theyr learning & knowledge, 
because I see them so earnest: therfore 
we may doo well to cut of, and abreuiate 
theyr communication. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
No Syr, that were not iust, that Phisitions 
should thus remaine, without defence 
Yea, and for my part, I doo greatly 
reioyce to heare this talke, Therfore let 
the conclusion be, that sithens each of 
them hath had his turne, although Signor 
Iasper hath bene somewhat long in his 
discourse, let each of them haue another 
course, and no more, which shall be as 
one that wryteth his minde, and an other 
that replyeth in our iudgement 
court. And then I am to desire you Signor 
Maister, to giue sentence, who hath the 
right. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
I for my part am content, reseruing 
the benefite of appellation, if the sente~ce 
be not giuen in my fauour. 
 
[^f.B7v^] 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
And I for my part am also agreeed, hauing 
so great a confidence in my Iustice, 
and also in the iudgement of Signor Maister, 
by meane whereof I binde my selfe 
to his iudgement and sentence. 
 
[}Maister Velasques.}] 
 
A harde matter is commended vnto 
me. But notwithstanding, I will saye 
what God shall giue me to vnderstand, 
to make an ende of your contencion, leauing 
lybertie to each of you to doo what 
ye please. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
Me thinketh Signor Bernardo, is ready 
for the purpose: begin on Gods name. 
 
[}Heere followeth the aunswer of 
Signor Bernardo.}] 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
AT the begynning of our talke, I 
thought Signor Iasper that you iested, 
But when I heard you touch in Doctrine 
and Histories: then I knewe that 
[^f.B8r^] 
your argument was in earnest. And 
therefore will I aunswere accordingly: 
that which I vnderstand of the thinges 
which you haue spoken, is in conclusion, 
that you thinke there should be no Phisions 
in the worlde: at the least, such as 
were knowen to be, and lyue of that vocation. 
 
But rather you would haue vs all to be 
Phisitions, and to cure one an other: also 
you would not haue medicine by Arte 
confounded, in Science nor Philosophy: 
But onelye to followe experience and 
conference, and the voyce of the people, 
as though we should lyue in the Mountaynes 
where no pollicie nor discretion 
should be vsed. 
 
These two principall points I meane 
to ouerthrowe, as a begynning to the 
processe, and then to aunswer some of the 
other mallices which you haue spoken. 
In the fyrst poynt touching Phisitions, 
it is a cleare case that you haue no reason, 
for the name of a Phisition is holie 
and amyable, and ought not to be odious 
vnto you: seeing Christe our redeemer 
dyd not despise both to be called and 
[^f.B8v^] 
holden for a Phisition, when he was 
speaking of him selfe: sayth he then, for 
the whole folke needeth not the Phisition. 
And againe, when he cured the eyes 
with clay and spyttle: and when he appoynted 
for medicine of the Samaritane 
Oyle & Wine, yea, he letted not to cure 
and heale infinite infirmities: and the 
lyke commaunded his Disciples, for S. 
Paule Doctor of the people, tooke bothe 
person and office of a Phisition, when he 
wrote to Timotheus, willing him to drink 
Wine to comfort his stomacke. Saint 
Luke the Euangelist dyd name him selfe 
a Phisition, and letted not to giue this 
Office vnto the Apostles. The Angell 
Raphaell woulde also vse this Office, 
whe~ he gaue a receyt vnto Tobias, wherwith 
he should cure and recouer the sight 
of his eyes. So that in this poynt you 
haue no waye to contend, because the 
name of a Phisition is profitable in the 
world. And if there haue bene some Phisitions 
bothe false and couetous, and also 
haue vsed of such things wherof you haue 
enlarged, and I thereof ignoraunt, you 
ought not iudge nor beleeue them. But 
[^f.C1r^] 
notwithsta~ding, the wise and good ought 
not to be cast of, it is a meete thing that 
there should be perticuler and appointed 
persons of so high an Office and misterie, 
and not rather, as you would to haue 
all men Phisitions, and so to walke in 
confusion and inconstancie, with ignoraunce 
of the people. Truly this way 
is not only vnprofitable, but also a thing 
impossible. 
 
The example also of the Romaines, 
wherewith you helpe your selfe, who 
were .600. yeeres without Phisitions: I 
say with you, that it is true. But yet 
through simplicitie and want of knowledge, 
as they were at that time ignorant 
of learning, and other Arts, so were 
they wanting of Medicine. But after 
they vnderstoode what Doctrine & Science 
was: and had receyued the same 
of the Greekes, they then embraced also 
medicine, as one of the most necessarie 
things. And lykewise the Maisters, who 
had sight therein: and euen so dyd the other 
Nations of whome you spake of. 
And where in the second poynt, you will 
not that we follow or obserue precepts, 
[^f.C1v^] 
nor yet to haue Arte nor foundation of 
Science, nor you will vs not to followe 
reason & cause, but only experie~ce which 
you allowe: and therfore you iudge euill 
of the forme and order which is obserued 
in medicines and their compound, wherof 
I doo not lyttle meruayle. 
 
Fyrst, you know how naked experience 
is in Science holden for doubtfull, and 
consideration & iudgement dooth change 
in yeeres, with complexion, with tyme, 
place, and many other thinges. And therfore 
it is necessarie for him that wyll 
cure, to knowe these differences, the secrete 
cause and discouerie of the infirmitie: 
for it is a thing vnpossible the knowledge 
of curing vnto him that knoweth 
not whereof, and where the disease dyd 
spring. It is therefore needefull that hee 
vnderstand the composture and complexcions 
of humayne bodies, their humors, 
& which of them beareth rule, and what 
disease thereof may growe. For, without 
doubt, the cure must otherwyse be 
handled, if you preuent the infirmyties 
of all fowre humors, as many Wise 
men affyrme. And contrarywise, if the 
[^f.C2r^] 
cause be in onely moysture, as Eropilus 
holdes opinion: according to the writing 
of Cornelius Celsor and others, or in the 
spirits, as Hipocrates thought. 
 
Yea. and also otherwise, if it be as Erasistratus 
iudged, y=t= the blood turning backwardes, 
to the arteries or veynes of the 
spirits cause inflamation, and the inflamatio~ 
causeth the moouing which we see 
in the Feuer. So that he shall knowe 
how to cure, which reacheth to the originall 
& true cause. And therfore you may 
consider, whether Arte and study of Philosophy, 
be requisite or no: so that of necessity, 
the causes of infirmities ought to 
be knowen. And also to vnderstand the 
quality and property of mettals, stones, 
trees, fruites, hearbs, rootes, and also of 
beasts, and all other thinges which may 
serue to y=e= vse of medicine, to auoyd error 
in their application. I doo not deny, but 
rather affirme y=t= experience is profitable. 
But I presume and am bolde to iustifie, 
that there can be no experience without 
some reason or cause: nor yet I thinke 
y=t= our Auncestors dyd vse their simples 
at all aduentures, without co~sideration. 
[^f.C2v^] 
But rather I iudge that by speculations 
and foresight in things conuenient, they 
made their experience, the which fyrst 
they coniectured to be good. Therefore 
honour in this case ought not to be giuen 
to experience, but rather to wisdome and 
counsell, which was the cheefest part. 
Howbeit, dayly are discouered diuers 
kindes of infirmities, vnto whome experience 
and vse ca~ not serue, because there 
can be no experience of a thing not knowen. 
So that of necessitie it is needefull 
to know by Arte and doctrine the obscure 
causes of the vice and corruption, which 
the humors and members may suffer in 
a man, besides these that are playne and 
open, as colde, heate, hunger, replexion, 
and other lyke. 
 
He also that will be a Phisition, should 
vnderstand what thing is actions, or naturall 
operations, and what are those by 
the which we giue and take the spirit of 
breath, we eate and drinke, the place of 
disgestion: and how the substance of our 
foode is deuided to giue strength to our 
bodies in all places. Also it is needefull 
to be vnderstoode, why our Pulses haue 
[^f.C3r^] 
continuall moouing, and what is the reason 
and cause of sleepe & watching: without 
knowledge whereof, it seemeth that 
he should not know how to preserue and 
cure infirmities. Besides this, men suffer 
great paynes and passions in the inward 
partes and members of the body, 
which is a thing needefull to be known, 
& to haue seen Anothomyes of some dead 
bodyes, to haue marked & considered the 
cullor, the figure, the bignesse, the order, 
and the hardnesse & softnesse of them all. 
Also the variety and deuision of the same 
members, among them selues, which doo 
ioyne together, or how they giue place & 
receyue: As we reade that Erophilus and 
Erasistratus dyd, requiring for the same 
purpose, men that were condempned to 
death, to prooue experience. For it is a 
playne case, that when any greefe or interior 
hurt happeneth, and not knowen, 
how or where it is, nor yet to apply outward 
medicine, for the vncertayntie of 
the inward greefe, nor the nature & reason 
thereof: And finally, for auoyding of 
perplexitie, I say that there are many 
necessary things appertayning to a good 
[^f.C3v^] 
Phisition, yea, and to declare them only 
it is requisit that such a one be a learned 
Philosopher. How much more to know 
how to put them in vre, insomuch, that 
Hipocrates sayth, that a good Phisition 
ought to knowe the disease past, & to vndersta~d 
the cure present: and also to pronosticate 
the thing to come. So that 
Signor Iasper, if you haue harkened well 
vnto me, you will not let to confesse that 
it is a thing necessary for Phisitions, to 
haue bothe rules and precepts, and that 
they be grounded on Sciences & Artes. 
And as this is a thing, that can not be 
common: it is therfore necessarie to haue 
perticuler men Phisitions, who ought 
to be honoured and esteemed as alwayes 
they haue bene. And it is not sufficient 
that you alleadge, that vices and disorders 
brought Phisitions to Rome, for 
although it had so bene, it seemed a speciall 
gyft of God, who hauing sent them 
diseases, dyd also send them remedy: And 
againe, contend and say what you lyst, 
the Phisitions dooth not counsell any to 
distemper them selues: but when any 
happeneth to be dystempered, then the 
[^f.C4r^] [^Original misbound, collation corrected.^] 
Phisition remedieth the same. 
 
And where you murmure, of the inuencion 
of Syrruppes and distylled waters, 
and of the compoundes of medicines, 
you are the more to be blamed. 
For rather the wytte and aduice of the 
inuentor is to be praysed, and to receyue 
the same as a good gyft, & mercy of God, 
who dayly giueth vs new remedyes and 
medicines. 
 
And if in olde time they wanted knowledge 
to make Syrrups, and distyll holsome 
waters, both sweete & pleasaunt, as 
now are vsed: I say therein, the aduantage 
is ours, and are therfore more bou~d 
to be thankfull to Phisitions, for so profitable 
and sweete a thing: and because 
it is a new inuencion, it is not therfore 
to be despised. For likewise in olde tyme 
they knew not was Amber Muske, nor 
Siuitte, which are most sweete and excellent 
Odors: And also the Mytridate 
and compound Treacle, which you reprehend. 
The reason is, because you vnderstand 
not, neyther the composition, 
nor the vertue of the things wherof it is 
made, nor yet the effectes therof. 
[^f.C4v^] [^Original misbound, collation corrected.^] 
And where you say that Phisitio~s ought 
to be punished as mankyllers, you are 
therefore worthy of great reprehension, 
to presume that they of mallice would 
kyll any, ne yet through ignorance they 
ca~not do it. But for their straight examinatio~ 
I doo not mislike: but rather holde 
it for a thing conuenient, notwithstanding, 
the Phisition vsing well his office 
in the obseruing of Rule & Arte, and the 
Patient should happen to die: he ought 
not to be punished for his death. And of 
the same opinion was Plato, appearing 
in the ninth Dialogue of his Lawes. 
And also where Phisitions procure to be 
payde for theyr paynes, they ought not 
therfore to be reprehended, sithens that 
by the Law of God and man, the laborer 
ought to haue his hyre. God also co~mau~deth, 
that the Oxe that treadeth out the 
Corne, be not musled. Moreouer, I may 
say, that of too much sharpnes of wytte, 
nay rather of mallice, wher you presume 
that of industry they darcken their Arte, 
with strau~ge names of things: for why, 
if you vnderstoode them: you would say 
that those names which seemed vnto you 
[^f.C5r^] [^Original misbound, collation corrected.^] 
straunge is their owne proper and true 
names from their origen, which is not 
vulgarly vnderstoode. And where you 
speake of their Letters & receypt, it may 
be accoumpted a iest, & a thing not woorthy 
of aunswer: because you know that 
such breuiations are vsed to auoyde perplexitie, 
for euery Science hath his tearmes, 
and breuiations in wryting. 
 
And againe, where you touched theyr 
varietie in iudgement, the discharge is 
euident, considering the wittes & iudgeme~ts 
of men are diuers, so y=t= with a good 
& whole intencio~, they may be co~trary in 
theyr sentence, and with small perill in 
medicine: considering that one disease 
may be cured by diuers wayes. And by 
this meanes Phisitions may varry, and 
by su~dry wayes come to one ende, which 
is the cure & health of the Patient. Now 
in this order, your euyll suspition & opinio~ 
is dasht and broken in peeces, by the 
sufficie~t reasons which I haue declared. 
And I thinke without any more contencion, 
you ought to cease & leaue of your 
arguing, and because I hope you will so 
do: I will not now proceede any further, 
[^f.C5v^] [^Original misbound, collation corrected.^] 
although I haue matter ynough. 
 
[}Dun Nunio.}] 
 
By my fayth Signor Maister, although 
I vnderstand little, yet me thinketh that 
Signor Bernardo hath shewed him selfe a 
valliant Orator, so that I am nowe on 
the Phisitions syde, I know not what 
Signor Iasper iudgeth. 
 
[}Maister Velasques.}] 
 
What he thinketh he wyll say: for as 
yet I ought not to speake, because ye 
haue made me Iudge, his turne abydeth 
for him, he hath also wytte and yeeres to 
aunswer for him selfe. 
 
[}The second part of the 
Dialogue of Phisitions, wherin the 
matter is concluded and ended.}] 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
I Am cleane contrary to the opinion 
of Signor Bernardo, and 
wyll not consent to any of 
his allegations: nay rather, 
I sweare by my conscience, that his own 
reason hath confirmed me more in my 
[^f.C6r^] [^Original misbound, collation corrected.^] 
opinion. And before I had heard him 
speake: I was not so great an enemy of 
Phisitions, as now I am. But whether 
I haue reason or no, by mine aunswere 
ye shall heare. 
 
Fyrst, I say you haue well vnderstoode 
my desire, wherein I would haue no office 
of Phisitions, in a common weale, at 
the least, such as should cure for money. 
But that we should one counsell & cure 
an other. And also we shall know & vse 
such remedies, which are already knowen 
& prooued by auncient men of experience, 
and to stick vnto the same. If this 
thing might so be, although there were 
some inconueniences: yet truly, they 
should be much lesse the~ those which proceede 
from the good and euyll Phisitions. 
By meanes of theyr purges & repurges, 
bleedings and rebleedings: yea, and you 
should haue as small a diffyculty therin, 
if determynatly we should begyn to dyspute, 
as to speake one language, and to 
haue one custome which are auncient in 
our Countrey, yea, and the great vse of 
olde tyme, should be as easy to cure the 
diseased, as in these our dayes. 
 
[^f.C6v^] 
So that heere is proofe and argument 
to see, that for the one part of medicine, 
which according to theyr owne opinion 
is the principall, which they call Esuall: 
that is to say, to know of what the Patient 
ought to feede, howe, & what it should 
be, more or lesse, the experience, vse and 
cou~sell which they haue among them selues, 
and now so commo~ to men: wherby 
without either counsell or receypt of the 
Phisition, men know what to eate, how 
& in what quantitie. And such rule wisemen 
dare vse and obserue. I speak not of 
such, who will voluntarily be disordred. 
Why alas, if in this, which is the cheefest 
poynt, we can lyue without tutors? why 
should we not then bring to passe, y=t= vse 
of curing should be as well knowen among 
vs? for why, the difficulty or peryl 
should be no greater, as I will shew, after 
that I haue made aunswer to your 
argument. 
 
And therfore will I chau~ge the forme 
of aunswering, because we are contrary 
in opinion. You meane to defend the 
Phisitions, of tyme present, saying: that 
Christe our redeemer, dyd compare him 
selfe to Phisitions, and that truly is as 
[^f.C7r^] 
much, as to defend the cruelty of the Lyons, 
because they are also called Lyons. 
Besydes this, your argument is verie 
weake, because your co~parison of Christ 
to a Phisition dooth not so well fit your 
purpose. So that I say, you may make 
them more perticuler: yet you shall see y=t= 
Christe dooth rather approoue my opinio~ 
then yours, for he dyd not appoynt amo~g 
his Disciples, one nor two to heale and 
cure: but generally, commau~ded them all 
vnto whome he gaue especiall grace, to 
cure and make whole, as you your selfe 
affyrme: so that this allegation maketh 
for me. And where you speake of the Angell 
Raphaell, and S. Paule: truly those 
holy Persons, sent not the sicke folke to 
the Phisitions of the Cittie to be cured: 
but rather they themselues tooke y=e= cure 
in hand, beeing none of that vocatio~: and 
how I pray you? iwis not with Purgations, 
nor blood letting, nor with your 
Diacatulicions, nor Skamonea: but the 
one with a lyttle Wine, whereof he had 
experience, & the other with the vertue 
of a Fishe, which God gaue him for that 
purpose. And therefore, Maister mine, 
[^f.C7v^] 
sithens that this Office is co~mon to Angelles 
and to men: it is not iust that two 
or three should ingrate the same, lyke tyrants 
in the Towne: because forsoothe 
they are learned men as you say, as I 
would to God they were: But if they be, 
in good time be it, for I say not that learning 
hurteth any. But I say that for the 
vse of curing, it is not needefull, for I 
holde not such thinges necessary, but only 
for the knowledge of cleere and euident 
thinges. For why, it is not greatly 
materiall to knowe the first and secrete 
origen of a disease, but rather to knowe 
what dooth helpe: But the inquisition 
and intelligence of secrete and hydden 
causes, and the knowledge of their naturall 
operations, and y=e= rest which you 
say is necessary to be knowen, I holde 
for a vaine thing, and also impossible. 
 
For besides, that the secrets of nature 
are incomprehensible, it is playne that 
this is so, for why, those that presume 
to know this matter, are Phisitions and 
Philosophers, who are diuers and contrary 
in theyr opinions, and can giue no 
certayne rule nor resolution. 
[^f.C8r^] 
For how would you that the Phisition 
should know the radicall cause, and first 
origen of all infirmyties, theyr opinions 
beeing so variable, as you your selfe 
haue declared. 
 
And why should I more beleeue Hipocrates 
(who affyrmeth the substaunce of 
the matter to be in the spirites:) then 
Erasistratus, who attrybuteth it to the 
turning backward of the blood to the arteries? 
And why should I credite more 
these, then others, who assygned other 
prynciples? And howe will you knowe 
how disguestion is made in the stomack. 
Truly, I for my part, dare no more credite 
the one, then the other. Seeing there 
are so many opinions, vpon the case, for 
some say y=t= the foode boyleth with heate, 
others say that it rotteth by way of attrycion 
& grynding, others denieth them 
bothe, & each giueth such reaso~s, as seeme 
true: so y=t= following the opinion of any of 
them, the cure shalbe perticuler & cleane 
contrary the one to the other. So that 
seeing the causes & origen so diffycult, y=e= 
certeynty seemeth vnpossible, & I see no 
[^f.C8v^] 
cause for a man to weary himself therin. 
But only to co~tent and serue our selues 
with the remedy that experience hath 
taught vs. And co~sidering that it importeth 
not to know what caused the infirmity, 
but only the way to cure the same: 
Nor yet I will not trouble my selfe to 
know how disgestio~ is made, but cheefly 
to know what meate is soonest disgested, 
& what is good to helpe the same. Without 
vexing my selfe to knowe the cause 
why: nor yet I passe not to knowe what 
is the cause of shortnes of breath, but rather 
y=e= way to remedy it without payne: 
I will neyther know, who mooueth, nor 
how the artyres mooue: but only vnderstand 
what signifieth the disordered moouing. 
And also it maketh not for your 
purpose, that you alleadge for new diseases 
that may happen, for when any such 
thing doo happen, he that cureth, ought 
not to imagine what y=e= origen was, seeing 
that of co~mon things he is ignorant, 
as before I haue declared. For it is sufficient 
to consider how the lyke infirmity 
hath bene cured, & without medicine, and 
so by experience, we may hyt on the certeynty. 
As for example, the disease of the 
[^f.D1r^] 
Poxe, how ignorant were Phisitions in 
the cure, as long as they went by Scie~ce 
& Arte? But after experience had taught 
vs y=e= vse of the wood, called Lignum Vite, 
or Lignu~ Sanctum: How notoriouslie 
were the diseases cured? without the 
knowledge of the origen of the disease, 
nor yet the cause why the sayd medicine 
dooth helpe? 
 
It seemeth also vnto you a necessarye 
thing, the Anathomy of dead bodyes: and 
in my iudgement, it is a thing of small 
effect, yea, & I rather holde it for a kinde 
of crueltie. For true it is, in such an Anathomy, 
there remayneth neyther the 
proper cullor, softnes or hardnes, or any 
other liuely thing, which you say was in 
the members of the dead and wounded 
bodyes, which are abyding in the lyue 
& sound bodyes: for if there be in a whole 
and liuely man, colde, feare, wearines, 
or any other meane affect, or alteration, 
which make exterior, & notorious chau~ges 
in the cullor and posture of the face: 
it is much more lyke the interior members, 
which are more delycate to change 
and alter with a straunge ayre. 
And truly I holde it for a meere madnes 
[^f.D1v^] 
to beleeue that the Armony and consert 
which is in y=e= liue body of a man, is to be 
found in one that lyeth a dying, or is already 
dead. Now if the Anathomy were 
of any effect, or coulde giue any lyght for 
the health of man, there dayly chaunceth 
men to be slayne in the warres, and by 
other mischaunces: where without crueltie, 
but rather to cure theyr woundes, 
they might make experience without the 
spoyling and breaking vp of mannes 
fleshe, by him that hath professed rather 
to heale it. 
 
And where you say that such men experimented, 
are Fallaxes, because they 
chaunge with age and tyme: I say that 
experience found out those chau~ges and 
not Arte, so that to experience all is due, 
and by the same, all is obtayned. Moreouer, 
the aunsweres which you make to 
my reasons are so weake, that they neede 
no reply at all. And where you say that 
Phisitions are not the cause of vices and 
diseases, because they counsell none to 
distemper them selues, but rather cure 
theyr hurte, receyued by distemperance. 
But I say, because some men haue such 
confidence in them, they encorrage them 
[^f.D2r^] 
selues to be gluttons, and dysordered 
persons, yea, and some tymes they giue 
them such counsell. 
 
But sithens that Signor Maister, is heere 
present, marke what Saint Ambrose 
sayth, vpon the .Cviii. Psalme, which is. 
The preceptes of Medicine are contrarie 
to the diuine counselles, because they 
forbyd fasting, and permit no Uigilles, 
yea, they will compell men in such sort, 
that he who giueth him selfe therevnto, 
shall vtterly deny him selfe. 
 
And where againe, you would defend 
Phisitions from punishment, by the 
Lawes of Plato I aunswere: that it is 
first needefull that you bring the approbation 
of those Lawes from the Emperour, 
for without that, your Lawes are 
of small effect: but although they were, 
Plato dooth not salue, but onely hee that 
cureth well, by whome if any mischance 
happen, he is faultlesse. But I spake vnto 
you onely of such as knowe not what 
they doo, which is the cause that they erre 
in that which they take in hand, and 
where there is on the earth no punishment 
for such: I beseeche God to chasten 
them, for it is a hard case that only Phisitions 
[^f.D2v^] 
are neuer ignorant of any thing. 
But if you goe to an Aduocate or Counsellor 
in the Law, with any hard question, 
he will aunswer, that be will study 
the cause. If you goe to a Diuine, he will 
oftentimes make theyr aunswere, and 
so will men of other faculties. But the 
Phisition wyll incontinent make aunswer 
to a thousand diseased folke, if they 
demaund any thing. Yea, they iudge it a 
lesser faulte to erre, then to confesse that 
they know not. Likewise their errors 
and euill successe, they will not let to lay 
on some body, eyther the disorder of the 
Patient, or the mallice of the humor, and 
whether I say true or no, I put you for 
witnesse. 
 
And where you say, that I vnderstand 
not y=e= properties & vertues of medicines, 
co~pounds: I aunswer that you say true, 
and I affirme the same, & say, that neyther 
the Phisitions, nor yet their Auicena, 
vnderstood them: nor yet is it possible 
to vnderstand the Armony and temper 
of .300. thinges together, and therefore 
they are abhominable. And for my part 
I will yeelde no thankes for the inuencion 
of them, as you commaund. 
 
[^f.D3r^] 
Neyther yet holde I for profitable, the 
Muske, Siuit, and Amber, although they 
are of delectable sweetnes in Odor, for 
we might wel be without them: for they 
profit not so much the health of the body, 
but in as many tymes they are hurtfull 
to the soule: And sithens you are so wholy 
iudging, that those names & darke receypts 
are not made by industry & mallice, 
I pray you be a meane heereafter, to 
keepe me from occasio~ of sinne: to induce 
them to Phisitions, to make theyr receyptes 
with a fayre plaine letter in our 
language, & then I will iudge as you doo. 
So that now Signor Bernardo, seeing that 
your argumentes and aunsweres vnto 
mine, are of no efficacie or strength, you 
ought to put them cleane from your opinion, 
and that you disturbe not medicine 
to be commonly knowen, and let vs not 
permytte to be subiect to two or three: 
Wherof Plinie complayneth because we 
will not knowe what is good for vs, and 
so we goe vpon other mens feete, we eat 
with other mens appetite, whervpon 
our lyfe and health is an arbitrement. 
Be not so curious in this matter, as to 
spend in learning, to study in the Uniuersitie 
[^f.D3v^] 
all your lyfe tyme, by means of 
which paynes, you may gette more disease, 
then by your study you might learn 
to cure. So to conclude, it is sufficient 
what I haue sayde, to approoue, that Experience, 
dyet, & good regiment, sufficeth 
principally for our health. Therefore, 
let vs not seeke rationall experience: but 
embrace the experimentall. And thinke 
not that medicine was found before reason, 
for the good Husbandman and the 
Marriner, by vse and practise, came to be 
Maisters, and not by study and learning 
to knowe the quallities of the heauens, 
nor the course of Planets and Starres, 
nor yet the bookes of heauen, and world 
of Aristotle: for why, we dayly fall among 
naturall infirmyties, with our 
chyldren, seruaunts, & neyghbours, therfore 
we ought not to be carelesse, for the 
vse and disease doo make vs Artistes, we 
haue nowe no neede of foundations: for 
the auncient and co~mon opinion, which 
experience we holde for Maisters, without 
buying the same for money: howe 
much more men ought not to be inferior 
to the Fowles of the ayre, and Beasts of 
the Wyldernesse, among whome there 
[^f.D4r^] 
are many that haue knowledge in medicine, 
necessarie for theyr vse: As the 
Harte knoweth howe to drawe out the 
arrowe wherwith he is wounded, with 
an hearbe called Ditamo. The Swallow 
giueth sight to her young ones, with 
the hearbe Chilidonia: the wylde Boore 
cureth with Organy. And many others 
likewise, of whom Plinie, and other wryters 
make relation. 
 
Then it should not seeme much for man 
to doo the like: and thinke not, y=t= it should 
be a thing vnmeete to liue in such vniformity, 
although you think we should erre 
for want of Phisitions: Howbeit, the 
greatest error is, in hauing too many of 
them, and theyr medicines. Nature hath 
a care to heale the sicke, with verie lyttle 
helpe: for the Phisitions them selues, 
say, that Nature is he that woorketh and 
cureth, and that they be but mynisters. 
 
In this sort lyued the Romaines, the 
time y=t= I haue declared, and all the world 
accordinglye, before Phisitions were 
knowen, and the lyke at this day among 
the people which dwel in the Mou~taines 
and barren Countries, who lyue longer 
and more in health, then the Cittizens, 
[^f.D4v^] 
where medicine & Phisitions abou~deth. 
 
Those men I say, would neuer suffer 
Phisitions to come among them: but only 
cure them selues with good regyment, 
hearbes & experience, among whome I 
could name some notable persons. But 
one will be sufficie~t for all the rest, who 
is the lyght, and honor of Spayne, for his 
incomparable doctrine and learning, he 
is called the Comendator, Hernam Nunes, 
maister of Rethorike, & other Artes, 
in the famous Uniuersity of Salamanca, 
who as yet would neuer put his health 
in the handes of any Phisition, and hath 
conserued y=e= same aboue, 70. yeeres without 
their helpe. 
 
You know also that in y=e= tyme of great 
Pompeius was the toppe of the Mountain 
is for power: and dellycate Romaine 
wittes, as Plinie wryteth, and other Authors. 
Howe Æsclepiades the famous 
Phisition, condempned the Rules & preceps 
of all others, and cured onely with 
dyet & rule, in eating, drinking, and rubbing 
the ioyntes and members, so that 
with these things of great experience, he 
condempned vtterly Purgations, Uomyts 
and such lyke: the fruite of his curing 
[^f.D5r^] 
dyd so much profite, that he onely 
was praysed and admytted, and infinite 
people came vnto him. 
The same Plinie sayth in his .35. Chapter, 
that he happened to cure one that was 
thought to be dead, and caried to burying, 
or to be burned, as the~ the vse was: 
so that Æsclepiades sayde, that his medicine 
was certayne, which he affirmed of 
himselfe, because his regiment kept them 
from sicknesse, or else he required not to 
be taken for a Phisition: and truly, he 
emplyed the thing which he affyrmed, 
for he him selfe was neuer knowen to be 
at any tyme sicke vntyll his death, although 
he lyued verie long, and with the 
fall from a Ladder, he ended his lyfe. 
So that it appeareth manifestly by mine 
allegations and proofes, that my opinion 
is not new, or singuler, but common and 
of great antiquitie, bothe certayne and 
true: and for such you ought to embrace 
it, and so I hartely pray you. Wherwith 
all I conclude, although I leaue much 
behinde to auoyde prolixitie. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
Truly Signor Iasper, you haue sayde 
well, and I for my part am so tender of 
[^f.D5v^] 
condicion, that euery one hauing ended 
his tale, carryeth me with him. But yet 
now I will stay a whyle to heare the determination 
of the Signor Maister. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
If you will giue me leaue, I promise 
that my aunswere shall not want. But 
sithens the Signor Maister hath to giue 
sentence in Iustice so manifest, beeing so 
iust and wise a Iudge: there needeth no 
farther information. 
 
[}The Iudgement and determination 
of the Maister.}] 
 
[}Maister Velasques.}] 
 
TRuly Signor Dun Nunio, I would 
gladly be free from my bond, because 
I see each of these Gentlemen so earnest 
in theyr opinions, yea, and the cause so 
well treated and defended, that I take 
the Plea for doubtfull: But sithens the 
matter consisteth not in any Article of 
the fayth: I may speake what I thinke, 
and they shall haue what they payd. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
Yet syr I pray you proceede, although 
they are so bent to theyr opinions, they 
[^f.D6r^] 
referre the determynation to your learned 
iudgement, so that they cannot chuse 
but humble themselues thervnto, wheras 
reason demaundeth the same. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
That which Signor Don Nunio sayth, is 
true, and therin we will bothe receyue 
curtesie, at the least I for my part exceeding 
great. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
And I much greater, for I beleeue assuredly, 
his woorshippe will approoue my 
opinion. 
 
[}Maister Velasques.}] 
 
Because I holde it for a good exercise, 
I will fulfyll your requestes, and giue 
my vowe in the matter, for I haue no 
iurisdiction to pronounce sentence, nor 
yet your maistershippes bound to passe 
or accept the same. But if I speake any 
thing to purpose, each may accept what 
he please, for I meane not to argue or 
dispute, but breefly in few woords, I will 
speake what I thinke. Your contencion 
principally consisteth in two points, and 
all the rest is accessary thervnto. 
 
The first is, that the one sayth, that 
for to cure humaine infirmities, neither 
[^f.D6v^] 
Arte nor Science, is needefull, but onely 
suffiseth vse and experience. 
 
The other sayth, that Arte & Rules are 
most needefull, and he that should cure, 
ought to be a Maister, learned, bothe in 
Arte & Science, and to haue great foundation 
in learning, as largely the matter 
hath bene communicated. 
 
The seco~d point which seemeth to come 
from the first, is, that Signor Iasper, who 
holdeth the part of only experie~ce, would 
y=t= there should be no knowen Phisition: 
but that generally all me~ ought to cure. 
And Signor Bernardo, defe~deth the cause & 
sayth, that it is conuenient to haue them. 
 
The troth is, that the first & principall 
question is not new, nor yet you the first 
that haue mooued and disputed the same: 
but rather it is very auncient in medicine 
and among Phisitions. And we say 
that alwayes haue bene the lyke discord, 
for some doo follow only experience, and 
therfore they were called Experts. And 
other desirous to knowe the reason and 
causes, and therefore they were named 
Rationalles. Cornelius Celso, and other 
Aucthors doo wryte thereof at large, and 
bothe the one & the other, hath had great 
[^f.D7r^] 
fauorers, so y=t= of these two first extremes 
if of force the one must be accepted, and 
the other to haue remedy. 
 
The last perill and most reasonable, is 
to follow the first, as Aristotle sayth, that 
those of experience are most fit, and able 
to cure, then the learned without experience. 
And speaking perticulerly, Plato 
of Phisitions, in his bookes of common 
weale, affyrmeth that a good Phisition 
needeth to communicate bothe with sick 
and whole men, yea, and that he himself 
haue bene also sicke, finally, he ought to 
be experimented: and also there is no 
doubt, but that medicine and Arte therof 
had his origen of experience, and no 
otherwise. So that in this case Signor 
Bernardo hath no reaso~ to deny the same, 
for certaynly the experie~ces beeing knowen, 
men as amazed began thereby to 
enter into Philosophy, and thereby to 
seeke out bothe reasons and causes, and 
so is this true in other actes, as well as 
in medicine, whereof is aucthor Aristotle 
in his bookes of high Philosophy, and also 
Marcus Manillius, and Virgill, doo testifie 
the same, saying: by vatiable cases 
experience made Arte. And because I 
[^f.D7v^] 
doo not remember which of these Ge~tlemen 
alleadged Saint Ambrose. 
 
I doo remember nowe that fauouring 
and holding part with Medicine, he dooth 
say and affirme in the same, I will therfore 
declare his woords, because his aucthority 
is great, which are these. Where 
sayth he, had Medicine origen, but onely 
of infirmitie. And where in the first age, 
men would teache theyr successors, and 
Decendentes, what thinges had done 
them good, and wherewith they cured 
theyr diseases, whereby vse made Arte, 
and infirmitie made maisterie, and that 
is the first and sufficient medicine, which 
experience made, and not the coniecture, 
and therefore they were called Expert, 
so that out of this sort sprung the other, 
and from thence tooke his vse & force, so 
that woord for woord, S. Ambrose affyrmes 
the same. 
 
But to auoyde wearinesse, I alleadge 
not other reasons and aucthorities, for 
therein is no doubt at all: but that experience 
was origen to medicine, & totally 
necessarie. But yet notwithstanding, 
those that were named expert, remayne 
not victors, who will not allowe any other 
[^f.D8r^] 
thi_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]g but onely experience, nor yet 
are ouercome. The Rationalles, which 
followeth Arte, because betwixt these 
two opinions there is a thyrd, & a meane 
which ought to be obserued, and that is. 
That although experience was, and is 
the origen, and without the same we can 
not well craue this faculty: yet notwithstanding, 
after the expected preceptes, 
Arte was profitable, and not onely profitable, 
but also necessary, as well for the 
inconstancie and chaunges which are in 
experience, as by reasons. Heere hath 
bene touched, as well to chuse and know 
the best, which without learning were 
vnpossyble to doo. For it is a playne 
case, that without learning and doctrine 
you can not make an intiere iudgement 
and election. 
 
And if this thing should not be reduced 
to Rules and Arte: all should be confusion, 
and forgetfulnes, and discord would 
confound all: To that if onely experience 
should be admytted. Yet Arte and 
Rules thereof, should be needefull to 
knowe and learne, howe and at what 
tymes, in what places, at what ages, 
in what dispositions, to what infirmities, 
[^f.D8v^] 
and to what occations they _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rofit to 
some, and what vnto others, and hereof 
perforce wee can not be without Rules 
and meanes, and this is the Arte which 
may not be wanting: for although experience 
hath bene the origen, and knoweth 
howe to finde, but not to keepe. 
But Arte dooth keepe and conserue: also 
you haue no leysure, euerie day to make 
experience, nor all men can not make euerie 
proofe, nor yet to carrie in minde 
the thinges that hath bene done without 
Rule and artifice therof. And for proofe 
of a thing so notorious, it shall not 
neede many reasons, nor aucthorities, 
for the experience wee haue before our 
eyes, that there is no worke nor occupation 
so base, which is not guyded by Arte 
and reason. 
 
The Husbandman, and the Marriner 
of whome Signor Iasper spake, saying, 
vse maketh maisterie. Although the 
same were so, yet they can not want 
theyr Regimentes, grounded vpon experience, 
wherby they were guyded, and 
learned theyr Arte, to be a lyght to teach 
others the thinges, whereof experience 
neuer wanted vnto them. 
[^f.E1r^] 
The like dooth the Mason, the Carpenter 
and other Artificers, who ioyntly with 
vse and experience, haue their foundatio~ 
and Rules. And sithence medecin hath a 
more precious and higher suiect: it is no 
reason that it should by them be deminished, 
how much more many of the other 
causes, and knowledge of other things, 
which already hath been argued, and although 
some will say that to know such 
thinges: should not notoriously be necessary. 
Yet at the least they cannot deny, 
but that it is profitable, & also although 
the same should not make a Phisition 
more perfit: yet he should be made more 
discreet and aduised, all which things can 
not be brought to passe without the learning 
of Arte and Rules, & if these things 
are difficult & many, they are not therefore 
to be refused nor yet the knowledge 
of them, as Signor Iasper affyrmeth: we 
know well that Arte is long, but yet co~tinuall 
labour and goodwill ouercommeth 
And also if all may not be known 
yet passe with the possible, and most necessarie: 
and though there be varietie in 
oppinions, yet also their are determinacions, 
and resolucions, there are also 
[^f.E1v^] 
Phisitions and Counsell for all, wherof 
the good Phisition, ought to be replenished, 
more then an other, of this opinion 
are the moste of the wise and learned 
Aucthors. But cheefely Plato in his booke 
of Rethorick, saith, for this cause is Arte 
the medecyn, for why: it is a faculty that 
dooth consider & know the nature of him 
that cureth, and the cause of the thing 
that worketh, and can of those thinges 
giue a sufficient reason. And that which 
is alledged is not to be vnderstood only 
necessary to cure the infirmytie, but also, 
a way to sustaine the health: for although 
Signor Iasper say that we know 
how to eate and drinke without counsell 
of the Phisition, or other Arte by 
only experience: true it is, but he that so 
dooth vsing temperaunce: dooth follow 
counsels and Rules, and also aduises 
giuen by Phisitions and wise men, and 
not so dooing commonly is caused infyrmitye. 
 
And euen so the moste Sapient Cicero 
in his second booke of Offices, affyrmeth 
that for to gouerne and sustaine 
health, is needefull for a man to know 
his owne complexion, and to abstaine 
[^f.E2r^] 
from suche thinges that offende him, 
and to vse of other thinges which agree, 
and are profitable for him, and to followe 
the counsell and Arte of them who 
knowe the same, meanyng the Phisitions. 
So that to conclude, for with 
men so graue and wise, I neede not 
to enlarge. 
 
The resolucion and my vowe is 
touching the first poynte, which was 
if onely experience were sufficient, or 
else if Arte and learning were needefull 
of which two wants in a Phisition: 
The want of learning is more to be 
suffered then the want of experience, 
but also that the perfit Phisition ought 
to be expert and learned, so that the 
Medecine muste appeere on bothe sides, 
that is aswell in the experimented as 
rationales, and ought to haue Arte; 
precepts, and foundation ioyntly with 
experience. 
 
Now let vs proceede to the second point, 
which is whether it be needefull to haue 
perticuler Phisitions, apointed & ordained 
or no. I say that of my former words 
dooth follow the true conclusion: that 
it is necessary to haue Phisitions and 
[^f.E2v^] 
knowen maisters, and that generally all 
men may not be of that vocation for although 
that only experience were necessary: 
it were not possible that all men 
should be experymented. How much 
more we haue approoued, and holde for 
certaine that Arte, Rules, and variable 
doctrines are needefull, the which cannot 
be commen. And sithence of all other 
Artes, and mecanycall Artifices, there 
are workemen, and knowen Maisters: 
Medecin ought not to be of lesse condicio~ 
and to haue learned me therein, bothe to 
study and dispute if neede require: then 
coning to be experimented, may vse 
and cure with holly medecine: And it is 
not to holde for comparison, that Christ 
did commaund all the Apostles to cure 
and heale infirmities, for that purpose 
was only to lay foundation of our holy 
faith, and not principally for corporall 
health whereof we now treate: how 
muche more, bothe for the one, and for 
the other, he chose and apointed seuerall 
persons, and gaue no power without 
distinction and election, the office and 
names of ordayned Phisitions, Signor 
Iasper, are of more antiquity, then as yet 
[^f.E3r^] 
we haue spoke~, no nor yet your profaine 
writers make thereof no proofe, for before 
Æsculapius, or Ipocrates, aboue 500. 
yeares, were Phisitions in the world, 
we reade Gen. chap. 50. that Ioseph commau~ded 
his Phisitio~s in Egipt, to anoint 
the dead body of Iacob his father, and in 
Exo. chap. 21. among the lawes that God 
gaue vnto Moyses for his people is one, 
that he who hurteth his neighbour shall 
pay, what he looseth in his worke, for the 
time spent, and also the cost and hyer of 
the Phisition where manifestly appeareth 
the wages and reward of the Phisition 
is iust and of great antiquitie, and 
in other places of holy Scripture, we 
finde that Phisitions were ordayned & 
knowen, as appeareth in Peralipomenon 
2. Chap. 16. where king Assa was reprehended 
because he called not on God in 
his sicknesse, trusting more in the Arte of 
the Phisitions, in which place it is plainly 
called Arte and not experience, which 
place maketh for our purpose, and euen 
so are there many other moe. The History 
and example of Asclepiades, which 
you aledge, who was in y=e= time of great 
Pompeus, is true. And in that time began 
[^f.E3v^] 
the sect, and maner of curing. But it 
was a plaine and a manifest deceit that 
he intended, because he knew not how 
to cure by Science, as Plyny himselfe 
affyrmeth: for he was an Oratour, 
and because he gayned little by that 
office, he determined to make himselfe 
a Phisition, and there spronge 
that heresy in Medecine, as other hath 
doone in other Artes, but as a thyng 
without foundation, it indured but a 
while, how muche more Esclepiades 
made not medecyne common: but his 
meaning was to inuent a new Arte, 
and to make hymselfe Maister thereof. 
 
So that Gentlemen, let vs vnderstande 
that experience made the Arte 
of Medecine, and that it is necessary to 
haue perticuler expert and learned 
Phisitions, and also I say another thing 
which as yet hath not beene touched, and 
is the moste necessariest of all, which is 
that such men ought not only to be learned, 
but vertuous faithfull Christians, 
and fearefull of God without the which 
no good Arte can be ministred, and for 
the abuses and defects which Signor Iasper 
hath touched, I knowe well that 
[^f.E4r^] 
some doo passe in the world, and I truely 
desire the remedy of them. But I say 
not what such Phisitions are, but I 
declare what they all ought to be. I 
also say and knowe some that synneth 
not in their opinion in manifesting them 
of their dealing, aswell in their mallice 
as in theyr medecynes, but the good 
Phisition will cure Christianlye and 
plainely, and apply according to wisedom 
the Medecines conuenient, he also 
knoweth what is needefull, either in 
Medecine simple or compound, which is 
the cheefest thing that Signor Iasper hath 
impugned, but not with reason, for although 
the simples are excellent and doo 
profite to mixe one with another: I say 
it is not hurtfull, for some vertues and 
properties doo helpe and temper others 
and that which one force could not doo: 
two or three do finish, for seldom, one humor 
offendeth the pacient, therefore it is 
to prouide for a whole & compound infirmitye, 
and thereto to apply compound 
medecine, and euen as we are compou~de 
of sundry complexions and elements, euen 
so we stande in neede of compounde 
medecines, aswell as of simples as in all 
[^f.E4v^] 
things we see plainly, in hot Countries, 
we myxe stronge wine with water, we 
compound thinges to make them more 
profitable for vs, we also ioyne and mixe 
our meates, to make them more sauery 
and medicinall, to Uinegar we put oyle, 
& to Hunny, Sugar, all things doo ioine, 
temper and resist, the which certainly is 
most necessary in medicine, and is of 
great effect and profit. But if in these 
things and others there be any indiscreete 
Phisitions or euill woorkemen: 
we should not therefore reprooue y=e= good, 
nor yet the Arte, which of it selfe is good, 
holye and profitable: but rather to procure 
that euery one be such as is conuenient, 
and to desire of God the same, vnto 
whom this Citty of Ciuill in my iudgment 
ought to giue moste harty thanks, 
for the plentie of good and learned Phisitions, 
which dwell in the same, of who~ 
truly I presume. But particulerly I 
haue had familiar conuersation in my 
diseases with fowre or fiue of them, and 
assuredly in them dooth conteyne y=e= qualities 
of excellent men, bothe of experience, 
learning and goodnes, and I haue 
the same opinion of many of the others, 
[^f.E5r^] 
and although Signor Iasper is not conte~ted 
with onely literature and precepts: 
let him therfore loue, and procure iointly 
with them experience, and also Signor 
Iasper, condemne not the doctrine in 
Phisitions, and trust not so little vnto 
them that you let to cure your selfe, whe~ 
you are sick. But my meaning here is 
not of such Phisitio~s as the Iester tolde 
y=e= Marquesse Ferrara, of whom Pontanus 
writeth. But now here is no place to tel 
that tale, although it is not euill to declare, 
for such as heretofore hath not 
harde therof. But sithe~ce it is now late, 
I conclude for this day, the thing I was 
required to do: and the rest shall remaine 
for another day. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
Signor Maister, I sweare vnto God, 
that I beleeue there is no more to be 
saide, sithence you haue so singulerly 
well determined the cause, & at the least 
I for my part, am fully satisfied, and 
should smally profit in any further disputation 
of these Gentleme~, to chaunge 
me from your sentence, howbeit I beleeue 
that now they are of your iudgement, 
for alwaies troth is of great force 
[^f.E5v^] 
being also holpen by your authoritie and 
eloquence. 
 
[}Bernardo.}] 
 
I for my part doo holde my selfe satisfied, 
and doo consent in the determination 
of Signor Maister, and I thinke Signor 
Iasper will doo the like, and so we may 
depart as we came. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
I cannot chuse but keepe silence to the 
thing that Signor Maister hath sayd, and 
the same ought to be moste certaine, sithence 
he hath so pronounced: but yet in 
my iudgement I thinke it not conuenient 
to cure with Phisitions, but rather 
take diet and good Regiment to be sufficient, 
yea and I haue heard them their 
selues say, that to cure therewith is a 
moste happy cure, so that still I will follow 
experience and counsell and you not 
able to condemne me, and for the other 
matters, let them passe in good time, as 
Signor Maister hath declared: and so we 
may depart, and God giue vnto your 
Worship entire health, that you neuer 
neede any Phisition, but onely that you 
may dye of age. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
Patience is good for aduersytie, but yet 
[^f.E6r^] 
I wyll not that ye depart vntill Signor 
Maister hath tolde his tale, touching the 
Phisitions of Ferrara. And with his tale 
Disputation shall ceasse for this day, for 
it is not late, and time there is for all. 
 
[}Maister Velasques.}] 
 
Because Signor Iasper shall pacifie his 
anger, I will recite the tale, although he 
hath read the same as well as I: the History 
is. That on a time, Nicholaus Marquesse 
of Ferrara, sporting and iesting 
with his Iester, he enquired of him of 
what Science or occupation were most 
number in Ferrara? the Iester aunswered, 
saying sir, the moste in number of 
any one trade are Phisitions, the Marquesse 
hearing this aunswer, laughed 
him to scorn, saying, thou idiot seest y=u= not 
that of y=e= facultie there is not in the Citty 
aboue fiue or sixe, and I am sure there 
is aboue 300. Shoomakers, and as many 
of many other Occupacions? The Iester 
aunswered, sir, where your Lordship is 
occupied in great matters you haue no 
particuler recknings, nor yet you know 
what nomber of Uassailes you haue, but 
beleeue me sir I haue told you troth, y=t= of 
the Art of medecin is the greatest nu~ber 
[^f.E6v^] 
in Ferrara, and I dare lay 200. Ducats 
that you shall finde it so. 
 
The Marquesse began to laugh againe 
and to deny his opinion, and in conclusion 
the wager was layde, although he 
iudged it for simplicity and madnes, and 
so he soone forgot what he had layd. But 
the Iester who had great desire of the 
money that was laide, hauing well considered 
the matter: The next day in the 
morning he arose, being Sonday, and 
wrapped clouts about his head, & Towe 
and Wooll bounde to his cheekes, fayning 
that he was wonderfully vexed 
with the tootheache, and in this order he 
sate him downe at the doore of the Cathedrall 
Church of the Cittie, and had 
sitting by him a boy who was his sonne, 
that had good skill in writing, this lad 
had his Pen, Inkehorne, and Paper, 
now the Iester being a man so commonly 
knowen in the Cittie, the people that 
entered and came out of the Church asked 
of him the cause of his sicknes, and 
he made aunswer to euery one that he 
had a maruelous paine in his teeth and 
Gummes, desiring them for Gods sake 
to giue him some remedy for the same, 
[^f.E7r^] 
and where we generally vse to giue cou~sel 
to those whom we see suffer any pain: 
as many as passed by tolde him what to 
take, although some one thing, and some 
another. So that his boye foorthwith 
wrote euery mans name that had giuen 
any remedy, and hauing abode there the 
time conuenient, and his copie of names 
and medcines full, and in the pickle that 
he sate at the Church dore: he went to 
the Marquesse Pallace, who had cleane 
forgotte~ his wager, & as the Marquesse 
espied him, he as other had doone, enquired 
the cause of his greefe, and being answered 
as the others were, he of gentlenes 
tolde him of remedy wherewith he 
should be whole. The Iester sayde sir I 
kisse your Honours handes, and after a 
while that he had abode there, he went 
his way home to his house, and caused 
all his processe to be writte~ fayre, which 
amounted to neere 500. persons, who 
were all Phisitions, and the Lord Marquis 
was placed for the first and principallist 
in the copie, and euery mans medecine 
ioyned with his name, the next 
day he came to y=e= Lord Marquesse Pallace 
without his rags about his head, as 
[^f.E7v^] 
a whole man, saying, right Honourable 
sir, now I am whole, and I thanke God 
cured by the moste honourablest Phisition 
of all Italy, which is you, for with 
your good counsell I obtained my health. 
Therfore I pray you commaund to pay 
the wager: for assuredly for my disease I 
founde all these Phisitions in Ferrara, 
that are here contayned in this memoriall, 
and if I would haue sought for 
more, iwis I had found more. The Marquesse 
beholding the roule of names and 
medecines, and seeing himselfe the first 
man, and many other principall persons 
of the Cittye, he laughed, and confessed 
that he had lost his wager, and commau~ded 
the same to be payde foorthwith, 
which truely was a merry iest. So that 
if Signor Iasper be contented with suche 
Phisitions: I say he hath reason, and 
shall finde aboundaunce. 
 
[}Don Nunio.}] 
 
By my trothe the tale is pretie, and to 
be laughed at with reason. I wyll therefore 
stay you no longer, depart on Gods 
name. 
 
[}Iasper.}] 
 
The Iester was pleasaunt, but I promise 
[^f.E8r^] 
you on my faith, that if he had the 
toothe ache in deede, he mought haue been 
cured with the counsels giuen vnto him. 
And I would rather trust the 500. Phisitions 
contained in the memoriall, then 
the fiue or sixe, which the Lord Marquesse 
spake of. And with this conclusion 
Signor Bernardo let vs depart, for although 
we haue beene earnest 
in our Disputation, yet 
we wyll depart as 
good freendes as 
we came hether.
