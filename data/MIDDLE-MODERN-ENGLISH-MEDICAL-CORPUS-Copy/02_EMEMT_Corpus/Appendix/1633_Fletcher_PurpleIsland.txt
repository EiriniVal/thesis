[}THE 
PURPLE ISLAND, 
OR 
THE ISLE OF MAN.}] 
 
[}CANT. I. STAN. I.}] 
 
THe warmer Sun the golden Bull outran, 
And with the Twins made haste to inne 
and play: 
Scatt'ring ten thousand flowres, he new 
began 
To paint the world, and piece the length'ning day: 
(The world more aged by new youths accrewing) 
Ah wretched man this wretched world pursuing, 
Which still grows worse by age, & older by renewing! 
 
[}2}] 
The shepherd-boyes, who with the Muses dwell, 
Met in the plain their May-lords new to chuse, 
(For two they yearely chuse) to order well 
Their rurall sports, and yeare that next ensues: 
Now were they fat, where by the orchyard walls 
The learned Chame with stealing water crawls, 
And lowly down before that royall temple falls. 
 
[^p.2^] 
[}3}] 
Among the rout they take two gentle swains, 
Whose sprouting youth did now but greenly bud: 
Well could they pipe and sing; but yet their strains 
Were onely known unto the silent wood: 
Their nearest bloud from self-same fountains flow, 
Their souls self-same in nearer love did grow: 
So seem'd two joyn'd in one, or one disjoyn'd in two. 
 
[}4}] 
Now when the shepherd-lads with common voice 
Their first consent had firmly ratifi'd, 
A gentle boy thus 'gan to wave their choice; 
Thirsil, (said he) though yet thy Muse untri'd 
Hath onely learn'd in private shades to feigne 
Soft sighs of love unto a looser strain, 
Or thy poore Thelgons wrong in mournfull verse to plain; 
 
[}5}] 
Yet since the shepherd-swains do all consent 
To make thee lord of them, and of their art; 
And that choice lad (to give a full content) 
Hath joyn'd with thee in office, as in heart; 
Wake, wake thy long (thy too long) sleeping Muse, 
And thank them with a song, as in the use: 
Such honour thus conferr'd thou mayst not well refuse. 
 
[}6}] 
Sing what thou list, be it of Cupids spite, 
(Ah lovely spite, and spitefull lovelinesse!) 
Or Gemma's grief, if sadder be thy sprite: 
Begin, thou loved swain, with good successe. 
Ah, (said the bashfull boy) such wanton toyes 
A better minde and sacred vow destroyes, 
Since in a higher love I setled all my joyes. 
 
[^p.3^] 
[}7}] 
New light new love, new love new life hath bred; 
A life that lives by love, and loves by light: 
A love to him, to whom all loves are wed; 
A light, to whom the Sunne is darkest night: 
Eyes light, hearts love, souls onely life he is: 
Life, soul, love, heart, light, eye, and all are his: 
He eye, light, heart, love, soul; he all my joy, & blisse. 
 
[}8}] 
But if you deigne my ruder pipe to heare, 
(Rude pipe, unus'd, untun'd, unworthy hearing) 
These infantine beginnings gently bear, 
Whose best desert and hope must be your bearing. 
But you, O Muses, by soft Chamus sitting, 
(Your daintie songs unto his murmures fitting, 
Which bears the under-song unto your chearfull dittying; 
 
[}9}] 
Tell me, ye Muses, what our father-ages 
Have left succeeding times to play upon: 
What now remains unthought on by those Sages, 
Where a new Muse may trie her pineon? 
What lightning Heroes, like great Peleus heir, 
(Darting his beams through our hard-frozen aire) 
May stirre up gentle heat, and vertues wane repair? 
 
[}10}] 
Who knows not Jason? or bold Tiphys hand, 
That durst unite what Natures self would part? 
He makes Isles continent, and all one land; 
O're seas, as earth, he march'd with dangerous art: 
He rides the white-mouth'd waves, and scorneth all 
Those thousand deaths wide gaping for his fall: 
He death defies, fenc't with a thin, low, wooden wall. 
 
[^p.4^] 
[}11}] 
Who ha's not often read Troyes twice-sung fires, 
And at the second time twice better sung? 
Who ha's not heard th' Arcadian shepherds quires, 
Which now have gladly chang'd their native tongue; 
And sitting by slow Mincius, sport their fill, 
With sweeter voice and never equall'd skill, 
Chaunting their amorous layes unto a Romane quill? 
 
[}12}] 
And thou, choice wit, Loves scholar, and Loves master, 
Art known to all, where Love himself is known: 
Whether thou bidd'st Vlysses hie him faster, 
Or dost thy fault and distant exile moan. 
Who ha's not seen upon the mourning stage 
Dire Atreus feast, and wrong'd Medea's rage, 
Marching in tragick state, and buskin'd equipage? 
 
[}13}] 
And now of late [/1./] th' Italian fisher-swain 
Sits on the shore to watch his trembling line; 
There teaches rocks and prouder seas to plain 
By Nesis fair, and fairer Mergiline: 
While his thinne net, upon his oars twin'd, 
With wanton strife catches the Sunne, and winde, 
Which still do slip away, and still remain behinde. 
 
[}14}] 
And that [/2./] French Muses eagle eye and wing 
Hath soar'd to heav'n, and there hath learn'd the art 
To frame Angelick strains, and canzons sing 
Too high and deep for every shallow heart. 
Ah blessed soul! in those celestiall rayes, 
Which gave thee light these lower works to blaze, 
Thou sitt'st emparadis'd, and chaunt'st eternall layes. 
 
[^p.5^] 
[}15}] 
Thrice happy wits, which in your springing May 
(Warm'd with the Sunne of well-deserved favours) 
Disclose your buds, and your fair blooms display, 
Perfume the aire with your rich fragrant favours! 
Nor may, nor ever shall those honour'd flowers 
Be spoil'd by summers heat, or winters showers; 
But last when eating time shal gnaw the proudest towers 
 
[}16}] 
Happy, thrice happy times in silver age! 
When generous plants advanc't their lofty crest; 
When honour stoopt to be learne'd wisdomes page; 
When baser weeds starv'd in their frozen nest; 
When th' highest flying Muse still highest climbes; 
And vertues rise keeps down all rising crimes. 
Happy, thrice happy age! happy, thrice happy times! 
 
[}17}] 
But wretched we, to whom these iron daies 
(Hard daies) afford nor matter, nor reward! 
Sings Maro? men deride high Maro's layes; 
Their hearts with lead, with steel their sense is barr'd: 
Sing Linus, or his father, as he uses, 
Our Midas eares their well tun'd verse refuses. 
What cares an asse for arts? he brayes at sacred Muses. 
 
[}18}] 
But if fond Bavius vent his clowted song, 
Or Mævius chaunt his thoughts in brothell charm; 
The witlesse vulgar, in a numerous throng. 
Like summer flies about their dunghills swarm: 
They sneer, they grinne. Like to his like will move. 
Yet never let them greater mischief prove 
Then this, Who hates not one, may be the other love. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}19}] 
Witnesse our [/3./] Colin; whom though all the Graces, 
And all the Muses nurst; whose well taught song 
Parnassus self, and Glorian embraces, 
And all the learn'd, and all the shepherds throng; 
Yet all his hopes were crost, all suits deni'd; 
Discourag'd, scorn'd, his writings vilifi'd: 
Poorly (poore man) he liv'd; poorly (poore man) he di'd. 
 
[}20}] 
And had not that great Hart, (whose honour'd head 
Ah lies full low) piti'd thy wofull plight; 
There hadst thou lien unwept, unburied, 
Unblest, nor grac't with any common rite: 
Yet shalt thou live, when thy great foe shall sink 
Beneath his mountain tombe, whose fame shall stink; 
And time his blacker name shall blurre with blackest ink. 
 
[}21}] 
O let th' Iambick Muse revenge that wrong, 
Which cannot slumber in thy sheets of lead: 
Let thy abused honour crie as long 
As there be quills to write, or eyes to reade: 
On his rank name let thine own votes be turn'd, 
Oh may that man that hath the Muses scorn'd, 
Alive, nor dead, be ever of a Muse adorn'd! 
 
[}22}] 
Oft therefore have I chid my tender Muse; 
Oft my chill breast beats off her fluttering wing: 
Yet when new spring her gentle rayes infuse, 
All storms are laid, I 'gin to chirp and sing: 
At length soft fires disperst in every vein, 
Yeeld open passage to the thronging train, 
And swelling numbers tide rolls like the surging main. 
 
[^p.7^] 
[}23}] 
So where fair Thames, and crooked Isis sonne 
Payes tribute to his King, the mantling stream 
Encounter'd by the tides (now rushing on 
With equall force) of 's way doth doubtfull seem; 
At length the full-grown sea, and waters King 
Chide the bold waves with hollow murmuring: 
Back flie the streams to shroud them in their mother spring. 
 
[}24}] 
Yet thou sweet numerous Muse, why should'st thou droop 
That every vulgar eare thy musick scorns? 
Nor can they rise, nor thou so low canst stoop; 
No seed of heav'n takes root in mud or thorns. 
When owls or crows, imping their flaggy wing 
With thy stoln plumes, their notes through th' ayer 
fling; 
Oh shame! They howl & croke, while fond they strain to sing. 
 
[}25}] 
Enough for thee in heav'n to build thy nest; 
(Farre be dull thoughts of winning dunghill praise) 
Enough, if Kings enthrone thee in their breast, 
And crown their golden crowns with higher baies: 
Enough that those who weare the crown of Kings 
(Great Israels Princes) strike thy sweetest strings: 
Heav'ns Dove when high'st he flies, flies with thy heav'nly wings. 
 
[}26}] 
Let others trust the seas, dare death and hell, 
Search either Inde, vaunt of their scarres and wounds; 
Let others their deare breath (nay silence) fell 
To fools, and (swoln, not rich) stretch out their bounds 
By spoiling those that live, and wronging dead; 
That they may drink in pearl, and couch their head 
In soft, but sleeplesse down; in rich, but restlesse bed. 
 
[^p.8^] 
[}27}] 
Oh let them in their gold quaffe dropsies down; 
Oh let them surfets feast in silver bright: 
While sugar hires the taste the brain to drown, 
And bribes of sauce corrupt false appetite, 
His masters rest, health, heart, life, soul to sell. 
Thus plentie, fulnesse, sicknesse, ring their knell: 
Death weds and beds them; first in grave, and then in hell. 
 
[}28}] 
But (ah!) let me under some Kentish hill 
Neare rowling Medway 'mong my shepherd peers, 
With fearlesse merrie-make, and piping still, 
Securely passe my few and slow-pac'd yeares: 
While yet the great Augustus of our nation 
Shuts up old Janus in this long cessation, 
Strength'ning our pleasing ease, and gives us sure vacation. 
 
[}29}] 
There may I, master of a little flock, 
Feed my poore lambes, and often change their fare: 
My lovely mate shall tend my sparing stock, 
And nurse my little ones with pleasing care; 
Whose love and look shall speak their father plain. 
Health be my feast, heav'n hope, content my gain: 
So in my little house my lesser heart shall reigne. 
 
[}30}] 
The beech shall yeeld a cool safe canopie, 
While down I sit, and chaunt to th' echoing wood: 
Ah singing might I live, and singing die! 
So by fair Thames, or silver Medwayes floud, 
The dying swan, when yeares her temples pierce, 
In musick strains breathes out her life and verse; 
And chaunting her own dirge tides on her watry herse. 
 
[^p.9^] 
[}31}] 
What shall I then need seek a patron out, 
Or begge a favour from a mistris eyes, 
To fence my song against the vulgar rout, 
Or shine upon me with her Geminies? 
What care I, if they praise my slender song? 
Or reck I, if they do me right, or wrong? 
A shepherds blisse nor stands nor falls to ev'ry tongue. 
 
[}32}] 
Great prince of shepherds, then thy heav'ns more high, 
Low as our earth, here serving, ruling there; 
Who taught'st our death to live, thy life to die; 
Who when we broke thy bonds, our bonds would'st bear; 
Who reignedst in thy heav'n, yet felt'st our hell; 
Who (God) bought'st man, whom man (though 
God) did fell; 
Who in our flesh, our graves, (and worse) our hearts would'st dwell: 
 
[}33}] 
Great Prince of shepherds, thou who late didst deigne 
To lodge thy self within this wretched breast, 
(Most wretched breast such guest to entertain, 
Yet oh most happy lodge in such a guest!) 
Thou first and last, inspire thy sacred skill; 
Guide thou my hand, grace thou my artlesse quill: 
So shall I first begin, so last shall end thy will. 
 
[}34}] 
Heark then, ah heark, you gentle shepheard-crue; 
An Isle I fain would sing, an Island fair; 
A place too seldome view'd, yet still in view; 
Neare as our selves, yet farthest from our care; 
Which we by leaving finde, by seeking lost; 
A forrain home, a strange, though native coast; 
Most obvious to all, yet most unknown to most: 
 
[^p.10^] 
[}35}] 
Coevall with the world in her nativitie: 
Which though it now hath pass'd through many ages, 
And still retain'd a naturall proclivitie 
To ruine, compast with a thousand rages 
Of foe-mens spite, which still this Island tosses; 
Yet ever grows more prosp'rous by her crosses; 
By with'ring springing fresh, and rich by often losses. 
 
[}36}] 
Vain men, too fondly wise, who plough the seas, 
With dangerous pains another earth to finde; 
Adding new worlds to th' old, and scorning ease, 
The earths vast limits dayly more unbinde! 
The aged world, though now it falling shows, 
And hastes to set, yet still in dying grows. 
Whole lives are spent to win, what one deaths houre must lose. 
 
[}37}] 
How like's the world unto a tragick stage! 
Where every changing scene the actours change; 
Some subject crouch and fawn; some reigne and rage: 
And new strange plots brings scenes as new & strange, 
Till most are slain; the rest their parts have done: 
So here, some laugh and play; some weep and grone, 
Till all put of their robes, and stage and actours gone. 
 
[}38}] 
Yet this fair Isle, sited so nearely neare, 
That from our sides nor place nor time may sever; 
Though to your selves your selves are not more deare, 
Yet with strange carelesnesse you travell never: 
Thus while your selves and native home forgetting, 
You search farre distant worlds with needlesse sweating, 
You never finde your selves; so loseye more by getting. 
 
[^p.11^] 
[}39}] 
When that great Power, that All, farre more then all, 
(When now his fore-set time was fully come) 
Brought into act this undigested Ball, 
Which in himself till then had onely room; 
He labour'd not, nor suffer'd pain, or ill; 
But bid each kinde their severall places fill: 
He bid, and they obey'd; their action was his will. 
 
[}40}] 
First stept the Light, and spread his chearfull rayes 
Through all the Chaos; darknesse headlong fell, 
Frighted with suddain beams, and new-born dayes; 
And plung'd her ougly head in deepest hell: 
Not that he meant to help his feeble sight 
To frame the rest, he made the day of night: 
All els but darknesse; he the true, the onely Light. 
 
[}41}] 
Fire, Water, Earth, and Aire (that fiercely strove) 
His soveraigne hand in strong alliance ti'd, 
Binding their deadly hate in constant love: 
So that great Wisdome temper'd all their pride, 
(Commanding strife and love should never cease) 
That by their peacefull fight, and fighting peace, 
The world might die to live, and lessen to increase. 
 
[}42}] 
Thus Earths cold arm cold Water friendly holds, 
But with his drie the others wet defies: 
Warm Aire with mutuall love hot Fire infolds; 
As moist, his dryth abhorres: drie Earth allies 
With Fire, but heats with cold new warres prepare: 
Yet Earth drencht Water proves, which boil'd turns 
Aire; 
Hot Aire makes Fire: condenst all change, and home repair. 
 
[^p.12^] 
[}43}] 
Now when the first weeks life was almost spent, 
And this world built, and richly furnished; 
To store heav'ns courts, and steer earths regiment, 
He cast to frame an Isle, the heart and head 
Of all his works, compos'd with curious art; 
Which like an Index briefly should impart 
The summe of all; the whole, yet of the whole a part. 
 
[}44}] 
That Trine-one with himself in councell sits, 
And purple dust takes from the new-born earth; 
Part circular, and part triang'lar fits, 
Endows it largely at the unborn birth, 
Deputes his Favorite Vice-roy; doth invest 
With aptnesse thereunto, as seem'd him best; 
And lov'd it more then all, and more then all it blest. 
 
[}45}] 
Then plac't it in the calm pacifick seas, 
And bid nor waves, nor troublous windes offend it; 
Then peopled it with subjects apt to please 
So wise a Prince, made able to defend it 
Against all outward force, or inward spite; 
Him framing like himself, all shining bright; 
A little living Sunne, Sonne of the living Light. 
 
[}46}] 
Nor made he this like other Isles; but gave it 
Vigour, sence, reason, and a perfect motion, 
To move it self whither it self would have it, 
And know what falls within the verge of notion: 
No time might change it, but as ages went, 
So still return'd; still spending, never spent; 
More rising in their fall, more rich in detriment. 
 
[^p.13^] 
[}47}] 
So once the [/4./] Cradle of that double light, 
Whereof one rules the night, the other day, 
(Till sad Latona flying Juno's spite, 
Her double burthen there did safely lay) 
Not rooted yet, in every sea was roving, 
With every wave, and every winde removing; 
But since to those fair Twins hath left her ever moving. 
 
[}48}] 
Look as a scholar, who doth closely gather 
Many large volumes in a narrow place; 
So that great Wisdome all this All together 
Confin'd into this Islans little space; 
And being one, soon into two he fram'd it; 
And now made two, to one again reclaim'd it; 
The little Isle of Man, or Purple Island nam'd it. 
 
[}49}] 
Thrice happy was the worlds first infancie, 
Nor knowing yet, nor curious ill to know: 
Joy without grief, love without jealousie: 
None felt hard labour, or the sweating plough: 
The willing earth brought tribute to her King; 
Bacchus unborn lay hidden in the cling 
Of big-swoln grapes; their drink was every silver spring. 
 
[}50}] 
Of all the windes there was no difference: 
None knew mild Zephyres from cold Eurus mouth; 
Nor Orithyia's lovers violence 
Distinguisht from the ever-dropping South: 
But either gentle West-winds reign'd alone, 
Or else no winde, or harmfull winde was none: 
But one winde was in all, and all the windes in one. 
 
[^p.14^] 
[}51}] 
None knew the sea; (oh blessed ignorance!) 
None nam'd the stars, the North carres constant race, 
Taurus bright horns, or Fishes happy chance: 
Asræa yet chang'd not her name or place; 
Her ev'n-pois'd ballance heav'n yet never tri'd: 
None sought new coasts, nor forrain lands descri'd; 
But in their own they liv'd, and in their own they di'd. 
 
[}52}] 
But (ah!) what liveth long in happinesse? 
Grief, of an heavy nature, steddy lies, 
And cannot be remov'd for weightinesse; 
But joy, of lighter presence, eas'ly flies, 
And seldome comes, and soon away will goe: 
Some secret power here all things orders so, 
That for a sun-shine day follows an age of woe. 
 
[}53}] 
Witnesse this glorious Isle, which not content 
To be confin'd in bounds of happinesse, 
Would trie what e're is in the continent; 
And seek out ill, and search for wretchednesse. 
Ah fond, to seek what then was in thy will! 
That needs no curious seach; 'tis next us still. 
'Tis grief to know of grief, and ill to know of ill. 
 
[}54}] 
That old slie Serpent, (slie, but spitefull more) 
Vext with the glory of this happy Isle, 
Allures it subt'ly from the peacefull shore, 
And with fair painted lies, & colour'd guile 
Drencht in [/5./] dead seas; whose dark streams, full of fright, 
Emptie their sulphur waves in endlesse night; 
Where thousand deaths and hells torment the damned 
sprite. 
 
[^p.15^] 
[}55}] 
So when a fisher-swain by chance hath spi'd 
A big-grown Pike pursue the lesser frie, 
He sets a withy Labyrinth beside, 
And with fair baits allures his nimble eye; 
Which he invading with out-stretched sinne, 
All suddainly is compast with the ginne, 
Where there is no way out, but easie passage in. 
 
[}56}] 
That deathfull lake hath these three properties; 
No turning path, or issue thence is found: 
The captive never dead, yet ever dies; 
It endlesse sinks, yet never comes to ground: 
Hells self is pictur'd in that brimstone wave; 
For what retiring from that hellish grave? 
Or who can end in death, where deaths no ending have? 
 
[}57}] 
For ever had this Isle in that foul ditch 
With curelesse grief and endlesse errour strai'd, 
Boyling in sulphur, and hot-bubbling pitch; 
Had not the King, whose laws he (fool) betrai'd, 
Unsnarl'd that chain, then from that lake secur'd; 
For which ten thousand tortures he endur'd: 
So hard was this lost Isle, so hard to be recur'd. 
 
[}58}] 
O thou deep well of life, wide stream of love, 
(More deep, more wide then widest deepest seas) 
Who dying Death to endlesse death didst prove, 
To work this wilfull-rebell Islands ease; 
Thy love no time began, no time decaies; 
But still increaseth with decreasing daies: 
Where then may we begin, where may we end thy 
praise? 
 
[^p.16^] 
[}59}] 
My callow wing, that newly left the nest, 
How can it make so high a towring flight? 
O depth without a depth! in humble breast 
With praises I admire so wondrous height. 
But thou, my [/6./] sister Muse, mayst well go higher, 
And end thy flight; ne're may thy pineons tire: 
Thereto may he his grace and gentle heat aspire. 
 
[}60}] 
Then let me end my easier taken storie, 
And sing this Islands new recover'd seat. 
But see, the eye of noon, in brightest glorie, 
(Teaching great men) is ne're so little great: 
Our panting flocks retire into the glade; 
They crouch, and close to th'earth their horns have laid: 
Vail we our scorched heads in that thick beeches shade. 
 
[^A printer's device omitted.^] 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}CANT. II.}] 
 
DEclining Phbus, as he larger grows, 
(Taxing proud folly) gentler waxeth still; 
Never lesse fierce, then when he greatest shows; 
When Thirsil on a gentle rising hill 
(Where all his flock he round might feeding view) 
Sits down, and circled with a lovely crue 
Of Nymphs & shepherd-boyes, thus 'gan his song renew: 
 
[}2}] 
Now was this Isle pull'd from that horrid main, 
Which bears the fearfull looks and name of death; 
And setled new with bloud and dreadfull pain, 
By him who twice had giv'n (once forfeit) breath: 
A baser state then what was first assign'd; 
Wherein (to curb the too aspiring minde) 
The better things were lost, the worst were left behinde. 
 
[}3}] 
That glorious image of himself was raz'd; 
Ah! scarce the place of that best part we finde: 
And that bright Sun-like knowledge much defac'd, 
Onely some twinkling starres remain behinde: 
Then mortall made; yet as one fainting dies, 
Two other in its place succeeding rise; 
And drooping stock with branches fresh immortalize. 
 
[}4}] 
So that 'lone bird in fruitfull Arabie, 
When now her strength and waning life decaies, 
Upon some airie rock, or mountain high, 
In spiced bed (fir'd by neare Phbus rayes) 
Her self and all her crooked age consumes: 
Straight from the ashes and those rich perfumes 
A new-born Phnix flies, & widow'd place resumes. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[}5}] 
It grounded lies upon a sure [/7./] foundation, 
Compact, and hard; whose matter (cold and drie) 
To marble turns in strongest congelation; 
Fram'd of fat earth, which fires together tie: 
Through all the Isle, and every part extent, 
To give just form to every regiment; 
Imparting to each part due strength and stablishment. 
 
[}6}] 
[/8./] Whose looser ends are glu'd with brother earth, 
Of nature like, and of a neare relation; 
Of self-same parents both, at self-same birth; 
[/9./] That oft it self stands for a good foundation: 
[/10./] Both these a third doth soulder fast, and binde; 
Softer then both, yet of the self-same kinde; 
All instruments of motion, in one league combin'd. 
 
[}7}] 
Upon this base a [/11./] curious work is rais'd, 
Like undivided brick, entire and one; 
Though soft, yet lasting, with just balance pais'd; 
Distributed with due proportion: 
And that the rougher frame might lurk unseen, 
All fair is hung with coverings slight and thinne; 
Which partly hide it all, yet all is partly seen: 
 
[}8}] 
As when a virgin her snow-circled breast 
Displaying hides, and hiding sweet displaies; 
The greater segments cover'd, and the rest 
The vail transparent willingly betraies; 
Thus takes and gives, thus lends and borrows light: 
Lest eyes should surfet with too greedy sight, 
Transparent lawns withhold, more to increase delight. 
 
[^p.19^] 
[}9}] 
[/12./] Nor is there any part in all this land, 
But is a little Isle: for thousand brooks 
In azure chanels glide on silver sand; 
Their serpent windings, and deceiving crooks 
Circling about, and wat'ring all the plain, 
Emptie themselves into th' all-drinking main; 
And creeping forward slide, but never turn again. 
 
[}10}] 
Three diff'ring streams from fountains different, 
Neither in nature nor in shape agreeing, 
(Yet each with other friendly ever went) 
Give to this Isle his fruitfulnesse and being: 
[/13./] The first in single chanels skie-like blue, 
With luke-warm waters di'd in porphyr hue, 
Sprinkle this crimson Isle with purple-colour'd dew. 
 
[}11}] 
[/14./] The next, though from the same springs first it rise, 
Yet passing through another greater fountain, 
Doth lose his former name and qualities: 
Through many a dale it flows, and many a mountain; 
More firie light, and needfull more then all, 
And therefore fenced with a double wall, 
All froths his yellow streams with many a sudding fall. 
 
[}12}] 
[/15./] The last, in all things diff'ring from the other, 
Fall from an hill, and close together go, 
Embracing as they runne, each with his brother; 
Guarded with double trenches sure they flow: 
The coldest spring, yet nature best they have; 
And like the lacteall stones which heaven pave, 
Slide down to every part with their thick milky wave. 
 
[^p.20^] 
[}13}] 
[/16./] These with a thousand streams through th' Island roving, 
Bring tribute in;the first gives nourishment, 
Next life, last sense and arbitrarie moving: 
For when the Prince hath now his mandate sent, 
The nimble poasts quick down the river runne, 
And end their journey, though but now begunne; 
But now the mandate came, & now the mandate's done. 
 
[}14}] 
[/17./] The whole Isle, parted in three regiments, 
By three Metropolies is joyntly sway'd; 
Ord'ring in peace and warre their governments 
With loving concord, and with mutuall aid: 
The lowest hath the worst, but largest See; 
The middle lesse, of greater dignitie: 
The highest least, but holds the greatest soveraigntie. 
 
[}15}] 
Deep in a vale doth that first province lie, 
With many a citie grac't, and fairly town'd; 
And for a fence from forrain enmitie, 
[/18./] With five strong-builded walls encompast round; 
Which my rude pencil will in limming stain; 
A work more curious, then which poets feigne 
Neptune and Phbus built, and pulled down again. 
 
[}16}] 
[/19./] The first of these is that round spreading fence, 
Which like a sea girts th' Isle in every part; 
Of fairest building, quick and nimble sense, 
Of common matter fram'd with speciall art; 
Of middle temper, outwardest of all, 
To warn of every chance that may befall: 
The same a fence, and spie; a watchman, and a wall. 
 
[^p.21^] 
[}17}] 
[/20./] His native beautie is a lilie white, 
Which still some other colour'd stream infecteth; 
Least like it self, with divers stainings dight, 
The inward disposition detecteth: 
If white, it argues wet; if purple, fire; 
If black, a heavie cheer, and fixt desire; 
Youthfull and blithe, if suited in a rosie tire. 
 
[}18}] 
[/21./] It cover'd stands with silken flourishing, 
Which as it oft decaies, renews again, 
The others sense and beautie perfecting; 
Which els would feel, but with unusuall pain: 
Whose pleasing sweetnesse, and resplen_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ent shine, 
Softning the wanton touch, and wandring ey'n, 
Doth oft the Prince himself with witch'ries undermine. 
 
[}19}] 
[/22./] The second rampier of a softer matter, 
Cast up by th' purple rivers overflowing: 
Whose airy wave, and swelling waters, fatter 
For want of heat congeal'd, and thicker growing, 
[/23./] The wandring heat (which quiet ne're subsisteth) 
Sends back again to what confine it listeth; 
And outward enemies by yeelding most resisteth. 
 
[}20}] 
[/24./] The third more inward, firmer then the best, 
May seem at first but thinly built, and flight; 
But yet of more defence then all the rest; 
Of thick and stubborn substance, strongly dight. 
These three (three common fences) round impile 
This regiment, and all the other Isle; 
And saving inward friends, their outward foes beguile. 
 
[^p.22^] 
[}21}] 
Beside these three, [/25./] two more appropriate guards 
With constant watch compasse this government: 
The first eight companies in severall wards, 
(To each his station in this regiment) 
On each side foure, continuall watch observe, 
And under one great Captain joyntly serve; 
Two fore-right stand, two crosse, and foure obliquely swerve. 
 
[}22}] 
[/26./] The other fram'd of common matter, all 
This lower region girts with strong defence; 
More long then round, with double-builded wall, 
Though single often seems to slighter sense; 
With many gates, whose strangest properties 
Protect this coast from all conspiracies; 
Admitting welcome friends, excluding enemies. 
 
[}23}] 
[/27./] Between this fences double-walled sides, 
Foure slender brooks run creeping o're the lea; 
The first is call'd the Nurse, and rising slides 
From this low regions Metropolie: 
Two from th' Heart-citie bend their silent pace; 
The last from Urine-lake with waters base 
In th' Allantoid sea empties his flowing race. 
 
[}24}] 
[/28./] Down in a vale, where these two parted walls 
Differ form each with wide distending space, 
Into a lake the Urine-river falls, 
Which at the Nephros hill beginnes his race: 
Crooking his banks he often runs astray, 
Lest his ill streams might backward finde a way: 
Thereto, some say, was built a curious framed bay. 
 
[^p.23^] 
[}25}] 
[/29./] The Urine-lake drinking his colour'd brook, 
By little swells, and fills his stretching sides: 
But when the stream the brink 'gins over-look, 
A sturdy groom empties the swelling tides; 
Sphincter some call; who if he loosed be, 
Or stiffe with cold, out flows the senselesse sea, 
And rushing unawares covers the drowned lea. 
 
[}26}] 
[/30./] From thence with blinder passage, (flying name) 
These noysome streams a secret pipe conveys; 
Which though we tearm the hidden parts of shame, 
Yet for the skill deserve no lesser praise 
Then they, to which we honour'd names impart. 
Oh powerfull Wisdome, with what wondrous art 
Mad'st thou the best, who thus hast fram'd the vilest part! 
 
[}27}] 
[/31./] Six goodly Cities, built with suburbs round, 
Do fair adorn this lower region: 
[/32./] The first Koilia, whose extreamest bound 
On this side border'd by the Splenion, 
On that by soveraigne Hepars large commands: 
The merry Diazome above it stands, 
To both these joyn'd in league & never failing bands 
 
[}28}] 
[/33./] The form (as when with breath our bag-pipes rife, 
And swell) round-wise, and long, yet long-wise more; 
Fram'd to the most capacious figures guise: 
For 'tis the Islands garner; here its store 
Lies treasur'd up, which well prepar'd it sends 
By secret path that to th' Arch-citie bends; 
Which making it more fit, to all the Isle dispends. 
 
[^p.24^] 
[}29}] 
Farre hence at foot of rocky Cephals hills 
This Cities [/34./] Steward dwells in vaulted stone; 
And twice a day Koilia's store-house fills 
With certain rent, and due provision: 
Aloft he fitly dwells in arched cave; 
Which to describe I better time shall have, 
When that fair mount I sing, & his white curdy wave. 
 
[}30}] 
At that caves mouth [/35./] twice sixteen Porters stand, 
Receivers of the customarie rent; 
Of each side foure, (the formost of the band) 
Whose office to divide what in is sent: 
Straight other foure break it in peices small; 
And at each hand twice five, which grinding all, 
Fit it for convoy, and this cities Arsenall. 
 
[}31}] 
From thence a [/36./] Groom with Wondrous volubilitie 
Delivers all unto neare officers, 
Of nature like himself, and like agilitie; 
At each side foure, that are the governours 
To see the vict'als shipt at fittest tide; 
Which straight from thence with prosp'rous chanel slide, 
And in Koilia's port with nimble oars glide. 
 
[}32}] 
The [/37./] haven, fram'd with wondrous sense and art, 
Opens it self to all that entrance seek; 
Yet if ought back would turn, and thence depart, 
With thousand wrinkles shuts the ready creek: 
But when the rent is slack, it rages rife, 
And mutines in it self with civil strife: 
Thereto a [/38./] little groom egges it with sharpest knife. 
 
[^p.25^] 
[}33}] 
[/39./] Below dwells in this Cities market-place 
The Islands common Cook, Concoction; 
Common to all, therefore in middle space 
Is quarter'd fit in just proportion; 
Whence never from his labour he retires; 
No rest he asks, or better change requires: 
Both night and day he works, ne're sleeps, nor sleep desires. 
 
[}34}] 
[/40./] That heat, which in his furnace ever fumeth, 
Is nothing like to our hot parching fire; 
Which all consuming, self at length consumeth; 
But moistning flames a gentle heat inspire, 
Which sure some in-born neighbour to him lendeth; 
And oft the bord'ring coast fit fuell sendeth, 
And oft the rising fume, which down again descendeth. 
 
[}35}] 
Like to a pot, where under hovering 
Divided flames, the iron sides entwining, 
Above is stopt with close-laid covering, 
Exhaling fumes to narrow straits confining; 
So doubling heat, his dutie doubly speedeth: 
Such is the fire Concoctions vessel needeth, 
Who daily all the Isle with fit provision feedeth. 
 
[}36}] 
There many a groom the busie Cook attends 
In under offices, and severall place: 
This gathers up the scumme, and thence it sends 
To be cast out; another liquours base, 
Another garbage, which the kitchin cloyes, 
And divers filth, whose sent the place annoyes, 
By divers secret waies in under-sinks convoyes. 
 
[^p.26^] 
[}37}] 
[/41./] Therefore a second Port is side long fram'd, 
To let out what unsavorie there remains: 
There sits a needfull groom, the Porter nam'd, 
Which soon the full-grown kitchin cleanly drains 
By divers pipes, with hundred turnings giring; 
Lest that the food too speedily retiring, 
Should whet the appetite, still cloy'd & still desiring. 
 
[}38}] 
So Erisic~thon once fir'd (as men say) 
With hungry rage, fed never, ever feeding; 
Ten thousand dishes serv'd in every day, 
Yet in ten thousand, thousand dishes needing, 
In vain his daughter hundred shapes assum'd; 
A whole camps meat he in his gorge inhum'd; 
And all consum'd, his hunger yet was unconsum'd. 
 
[}39}] 
Such would the state of this whole Island be, 
If those pipes windings (passage quick delaying) 
Should not refrain too much edacitie, 
With longer stay fierce appetite allaying. 
[/42./] These pipes are seven fold longer then the Isle, 
Yet all are folded in a little pile, 
Whereof three noble are and thinne, three thick, & vile. 
 
[}40}] 
[/43./] The first is narrow'st, and down-right doth look, 
Lest that his charge discharg'd might back retire; 
And by the way takes in a bitter brook, 
That when the chanel's stopt with stifeling mire, 
Through th' idle pipe with piercing waters soking, 
His tenden sides with sharpest stream provoking, 
Thrusts out the muddy parts, & rids the miry choking. 
 
[^p.27^] 
[}41}] 
[/44./] The second lean and lank, still pill'd, and harri'd 
By mighty bord'rers oft his barns invading: 
Away his food and new-inn'd store is carri'd; 
Therefore an angry colour, never fading, 
Purples his cheek: [/45./] the third for length exceeds, 
And down his stream in hundred turnings leads: 
These three most noble are, adorn'd with silken threads. 
 
[}42}] 
[/46./] The formost of the base half blinde appeares; 
And where his broad way in an Isthmos ends, 
There he examines all his passengers, 
And those who ought not scape, he backward sends: 
[/47./] The second Æols court, where tempests raging 
Shut close within a cave the windes encaging, 
With earthquakes shakes the Island, thunders sad presaging. 
 
[}43}] 
[/48./] The last down-right falls to port Esquiline, 
More strait above, beneath still broader growing; 
Soon as the gate opes by the Kings assigne, 
Empties it self, farre thence the filth out-throwing: 
This gate endow'd with many properties, 
Yet for his office sight and naming flies; 
Therefore between two hills, in darkest valleys lies. 
 
[}44}] 
[/49./] To that Arch-citie of this government 
The three first pipes the ready feast convoy: 
The other three, in baser office spent, 
Fling out the dregs, which else the kitchin cloy. 
[/50./] In every one the Hepar keeps his spies; 
Who if ought good with evil blended lies, 
Thence bring it back again to Hepars treasuries. 
 
[^p.28^] 
[}45}] 
Two severall covers fence these twice three pipes: 
[/51./] The first from over-swimming takes his name, 
Like cobweb-lawn woven with hundred stripes: 
[/52./] The second, strength'ned with a double frame, 
From forein enmitie the pipes maintains: 
[/53./] Close by the Pancreas stands, who ne're complains; 
Though prest by all his neighbours, he their state sustains. 
 
[}46}] 
Next Hepar, chief of all these lower parts, 
One of the three, yet of the three the least. 
But see, the Sunne, like to undaunted hearts, 
Enlarges in his fall his ample breast: 
Now hie we home; the pearled dew ere long 
Will wet the mothers, and their tender young: 
To morrow with the day we may renew our song. 
 
[^p.29^] 
[}CANT. III.}] 
 
THe Morning fresh, dappling her horse with roses, 
(Vext at the lingring shades, that long had left her 
In Tithons freezing arms) the light discloses; 
And chasing Night, of rule and heav'n berest her: 
The Sunne with gentle beams his rage disguises, 
And like aspiring tyrants, temporises; 
Never to be endur'd, but when he falls, or rises. 
 
[}2}] 
Thirsil from withy prison, as he uses, 
Lets out his flock, and on an hill stood heeding 
Which bites the grasse, and which his meat refuses; 
So his glad eyes fed with their greedy feeding: 
Straight flock a shoal of Nymphs & shepherd-swains 
While all their lambes rang'd on the flowry plains; 
Then thus the boy began, crown'd with their circling trains. 
 
[}3}] 
You gentle shepherds, and you snowie fires, 
That sit around, my rugged rimes attending; 
How may I hope to quit your strong desires, 
In verse uncomb'd such wonders comprehending? 
Too well I know my rudenesse all unfit 
To frame this curious Isle, whose framing yet 
Was never throughly known to any humane wit. 
 
[}4}] 
Thou Shepherd-God, who onely know'st it right, 
And hid'st that art from all the world beside; 
Shed in my mistie breast thy sparkling light, 
And in this fogge my erring footsteps guide; 
Thou who first mad'st, and never wilt forsake it: 
Else how shall my weak hand dare undertake it, 
When thou thy self ask'st counsel of thy self to make it? 
 
[^p.30^] 
[}5}] 
Next to Koilia, on the right side stands, 
Fairly dispread in large dominion, 
Th' [/54./] Arch-citie Hepar, stretching her commands 
To all within this lower region; 
Fenc't with sure barres, and strongest situation; 
So never fearing foreiners invasion: 
Hence are the [/55./] walls slight, thinne; built but for sight & fashion. 
 
[}6}] 
[/56./] To th' Heart and to th' Head-citie surely ti'd 
With firmest league, and mutuall reference: 
His liegers there, theirs ever here abide, 
To take up strife, and casuall difference: 
[/57./] Built all alike, seeming like rubies sheen, 
Of some peculiar matter; such I ween, 
As over all the world may no where else be seen. 
 
[}7}] 
[/58./] Much like a mount it easily ascendeth; 
The upper part's all smooth as slipperie glasse: 
But on the lower many a cragge dependeth; 
Like to the hangings of some rockie masse: 
[/59./] Here first the purple fountain making vent, 
By thousand rivers through the Isle dispent, 
Gives every part fit growth and daily nourishment. 
 
[}8}] 
[/60./] In this fair town the Isles great Steward dwells; 
His porphyre house glitters in purple die; 
In purple clad himself; from hence he deals 
His store to all the Isles necessitie: 
And though the rent he daily duly pay, 
Yet doth his flowing substance ne're decay; 
All day he rent receives, returns it all the day. 
 
[^p.31^] 
[}9}] 
And like that golden starre, which cuts his way 
Through Saturns ice, and Mars his firy ball; 
Temp'ring their strife with his more kindely ray: 
So 'tween the Splenions frost and th' angry Gall 
The joviall Hepar sits; with great expence 
Cheering the Isle by his sweet influence; 
So slakes their envious rage and endlesse difference. 
 
[}10}] 
Within, some say, [/61./] Love hath his habitation; 
Not Cupids self, but Cupids better brother: 
For Cupids self dwells with a lower nation, 
But this more sure, much chaster then the other; 
By whose command we either love our kinde, 
Or with most perfect love affect the minde; 
With such a diamond knot he often souls can binde. 
 
[}11}] 
[/62./] Two purple streams here raise their boiling heads; 
The first and least in th' hollow cavern breeding, 
His waves on divers neighbour grounds dispreads: 
The next fair river all the rest exceeding, 
Topping the hill, breaks forth in fierce evasion, 
And sheds abroad his Nile-like inundation; 
So gives to all the Isle their food and vegetation. 
 
[}12}] 
Yet these from other streams much different; 
For others, as they longer, broader grow, 
These as they runne in narrow banks impent, 
Are then at least, when in the main they flow: 
Much like a tree, which all his roots so guides, 
That all the trunk in his full body hides; 
Which straight his stemme to thousand branches subdivides. 
 
[^p.32^] 
[}13}] 
[/63./] Yet lest these streams might hap to be infected 
With other liquours in the well abounding; 
Before their flowing chanels are detected, 
Some lesser delfs, the fountains bottome sounding, 
Suck out the baser streams, the springs annoying, 
An hundred pipes unto that end employing; 
Thence run to fitter place their noisome load convoying. 
 
[}14}] 
Such is fair Hepar; [/64./] which with great dissension 
Of all the rest pleads most antiquitie; 
But yet th' Heart-citie with no lesse contention, 
And justest challenge, claims prioritie: 
But sure the Hepar was the elder bore; 
For that small river, call'd the Nurse, of yore 
Laid boths foundation, yet Hepar built afore. 
 
[}15}] 
Three pois'nous liquours from this purple well 
Rise with the native streams; [/65./] the first like fire, 
All flaming hot, red furious, and fell, 
The spring of dire debate, and civile ire; 
Which wer't not surely held with strong retention, 
Would stirre domestick strife, and fierce contention, 
And waste the weary Isle with never ceas'd dissension. 
 
[}16}] 
Therefore close by a little conduit stands, 
[/66./] Choledochus, that drags this poison hence, 
And safely locks it up in prison bands; 
Thence gently drains it through a narrow fence; 
A needfull fence, attended with a guard, 
That watches in the straits all closely barr'd, 
Lest some might back escape, and break the prison ward. 
 
[^p.33^] 
[}17}] 
The [/67./] next ill stream the wholesome fount offending, 
All dreery black and frightfull, hence convay'd 
By divers drains unto the Splenion tending, 
The Splenion o're against the Hepar laid, 
Built long, and square: some say that laughter here 
Keeps residence; but laughter fits not there, 
Where darknesse ever dwells, and melancholy fear. 
 
[}18}] 
[/68./] And should these waies, stopt by ill accident, 
To th' Hepar streams turn back their muddie humours; 
The cloudie Isle with hellish dreeriment 
Would soon be fill'd, and thousand fearfull rumours: 
Fear hides him here, lockt deep in earthy cell; 
Dark, dolefull, deadly-dull, a little hell, 
Where with him fright, despair, and thousand horrours dwell. 
 
[}19}] 
[/69./] If this black town in over-growth increases, 
With too much strength his neighbours over-bearing; 
The Hepar daily, and whole Isle decreases, 
Like ghastly shade, or ashie ghost appearing: 
But when it pines, th' Isle thrives; its curse, his blessing: 
[/70./] So when a tyrant raves, his subjects pressing, 
His gaining is their losse, his treasure their distressing. 
 
[}20}] 
[/71./] The third bad water, bubbling from this fountain, 
Is wheyish cold, which with good liquours meint, 
Is drawn into the double Nephros mountain; 
Which suck the best for growth, and nourishment: 
[/72./] The worst, as through a little pap, distilling 
To divers pipes, the pale cold humour swilling, 
Runs down to th' Urine-lake, his banks thrice daily filling. 
 
[^p.34^] 
[}21}] 
[/73./] These mountains differ but in situation; 
In form and matter like: the left is higher, 
Lest even height might slack their operation: 
Both like the Moon which now wants half her fire; 
Yet into two obtuser angles bended, 
Both strongly with a double wall defended; 
And both have walls of mudde before those walls extended. 
 
[}22}] 
The sixt and last town in this region, 
With largest stretcht precincts, and compasse wide, 
Is that, where Venus and her wanton sonne 
(Her wanton Cupid) will in youth reside: 
For though his arrows and his golden bow 
On other hills he frankly does bestow, 
Yet here he hides the fire with which each heart doth glow. 
 
[}23}] 
For that great Providence, their course foreseeing 
Too eas'ly led into the sea of death; 
After this first, gave them a second being, 
Which in their off-spring newly flourisheth: 
He therefore made the fire of generation 
To burn in Venus courts without cessation, 
Out of whose ashes comes another Island nation. 
 
[}24}] 
For from the first a fellow Isle he fram'd, 
(For what alone can live, or fruitfull be?) 
Arren the first, the second Thelu nam'd; 
Weaker the last, yet fairer much to see: 
Alike in all the rest, here disagreeing, 
Where Venus and her wanton have their being: 
For nothing is produc't of two in all agreeing. 
 
[^p.35^] 
[}25}] 
But though some few in these hid parts would see 
Their Makers glory, and their justest shame; 
Yet for the most would turn to luxurie, 
And what they should lament, would make their game: 
Flie then those parts, which best are undescri'd; 
Forbear, my maiden song, to blazon wide 
What th' Isle and Natures self doth ever strive to hide. 
 
[}26}] 
These two fair Isles distinct in their creation, 
Yet one extracted from the others side, 
Are oft made one by Loves firm combination, 
And from this unitie are multipli'd: 
Strange may it seem; such their condition, 
That they are more dispread by union; 
And two are twenty made, by being made in one. 
 
[}27}] 
For from these two in Loves delight agreeing, 
Another little Isle is soon proceeding; 
At first of unlike frame and matter being, 
In Venus temple takes it form and breeding; 
Till at full time the tedious prison flying, 
It breaks all lets its ready way denying; 
And shakes the trembling Isle with often painfull dying. 
 
[}28}] 
So by the Bosphor straits in Euxine seas, 
Not farre from old Byzantum, closely stand 
Two neighbour Islands, call'd Symplegades, 
Which sometime seem but one combined land: 
For often meeting on the watrie plain, 
And parting oft, tost by the boist'rous main, 
They now are joyn'd in one, and now disjoyn'd again. 
 
[^p.36^] 
[}29}] 
Here oft not Lust, but sweetest Chastitie, 
Coupled sometimes, and sometimes single, dwells; 
Now linkt with Love, to quench Lusts tyrannie, 
Now Phnix-like alone in narrow cells: 
Such Phnix one, but one at once may be: 
In Albions hills thee, Basilissa, thee, 
Such onely have I seen, such shall I never see. 
 
[}30}] 
What Nymph was this, (said fairest Rosaleen) 
Whom thou admirest thus above so many? 
She, while she was, (ah!) was the shepherds Queen; 
Sure such a shepherds Queen was never any: 
But (ah!) no joy her dying heart contented, 
Since she a deare Deers side unwilling rented; 
Whose death she all too late, too soon, too much, repented. 
 
[}31}] 
Ah royall maid! why should'st thou thus lament thee? 
Thy little fault was but too much beleeving: 
It is too much so much thou should'st repent thee; 
His joyous soul at rest desires no grieving. 
These words (vain words!) fond comforters did lend her; 
But (ah!) no words, no prayers might ever bend her 
To give an end to grief, till endlesse grief did end her. 
 
[}32}] 
But how should I those sorrows dare display? 
Or how limme forth her vertues wonderment? 
She was (ay me! she was) the sweetest May 
That ever flowr'd in Albions regiment. 
Few eyes fall'n lights adore: yet fame shall keep 
Her name awake, when others silent sleep; 
While men have eares to heare, eyes to look back, and 
weep. 
 
[^p.37^] 
[}33}] 
And though the curres (which whelpt & nurst in Spain, 
Learn of fell Geryon to snarle and brawl) 
Have vow'd and strove her Virgin tombe to stain; 
And grinne, and fome, and rage, and yelp, and bawl: 
Yet shall our Cynthia's high-triumphing light 
Deride their houling throats, and toothlesse spight; 
And sail through heav'n, while they sink down in endlesse night. 
 
[}34}] 
So is this Islands lower region: 
Yet ah much better is it sure then so. 
But my poore reeds, like my condition, 
(Low is the shepherds state, my song as low) 
Marre what they make: but now in yonder shade 
Rest we, while Sunnes have longer shadows made: 
See how our panting flocks runne to the cooler glade. 
 
[^A printer's device omitted.^] 
 
[^p.38^] 
[}CANT. IIII.}] 
 
THe shepherds in the shade their hunger feasted 
With simple cates, such as the countrey yeelds; 
And while from scorching beams secure they rested, 
The Nymphs disperst along the woody fields, 
Pull'd from their stalks the blushing strawberries, 
Which lurk close shrouded from high looking-eyes; 
Shewing that sweetnesse oft both low and hidden lies. 
 
[}2}] 
But when the day had his meridian runne 
Between his highest throne, and low declining, 
Thirsil again his forced task begunne, 
His wonted audience his sides entwining. 
The middle Province next this lower stands, 
Where th' Isles Heart-city spreads his large co~mands, 
Leagu'd to the neighbour towns with sure and friendly bands. 
 
[}3}] 
Such as that starre, which sets his glorious chair 
In midst of heav'n, and to dead darknesse here 
Gives light and life; such is this citie fair: 
Their ends, place, office, state, so nearely neare, 
That those wise ancients from their natures sight, 
And likenesse, turn'd their names, and call'd aright 
The sunne the great worlds heart, the heart the lesse worlds light. 
 
[}4}] 
[/74./] This middle coast to all the Isle dispends 
All heat and life: hence it another Guard 
(Beside those common to the first) defends; 
Built whole of massie stone, cold, drie, and hard: 
Which stretching round about his circling arms, 
Warrants these parts from all exteriour harms; 
Repelling angry force, securing all alar'ms. 
 
[^p.39^] 
[}5}] 
But in the front [/75./] two fair twin-bulwarks rise, 
In th' Arren built for strength, and ornament; 
In Thelu of more use, and larger size; 
For hence the young Isle draws his nourishment: 
Here lurking Cupid hides his bended bow; 
Here milkie springs in sugred rivers flow; 
Which first gave th' infant Isle to be, and then to grow. 
 
[}6}] 
[/76./] For when the lesser Island (still increasing 
In Venus temple) to some greatnesse swells, 
Now larger rooms and bigger spaces seizing, 
It stops the Hepar rivers; backward reels 
The stream, and to these hills bears up his flight, 
And in these founts (by some strange hidden might) 
Dies his fair rosie waves into a lily white. 
 
[}7}] 
So where fair Medway, down the Kentish dales 
To many towns her plenteous waters dealing, 
Lading her banks, into wide Thamis falls; 
The big-grown main with fomie billows swelling, 
Stops there the sudding stream; her steddy race 
Staggers awhile, at length flies back apace, 
And to the parent fount returns its fearfull pace. 
 
[}8}] 
[/77./] These two fair mounts are like two hemispheres, 
Endow'd with goodly gifts and qualities; 
Whose top two little purple hillocks reares, 
Most like the Poles in heavens Axletrees: 
And round about two circling altars gire, 
In blushing red; the rest in snowy tire 
Like Thracian Hamus looks, which ne're feels Phbus 
fire. 
 
[^p.40^] 
[}9}] 
That mighty hand in these dissected wreathes, 
(Where moves our Sunne) his thrones fair picture gives; 
The pattern breathlesse, but the picture breathes; 
His highest heav'n is dead, our low heav'n lives: 
Nor scorns that loftie one thus low to dwell; 
Here his best starres he sets, and glorious cell; 
And fills with faintly spirits, so turns to heav'n from hell. 
 
[}10}] 
About this Region round in compasse stands 
A Guard, both for defence, and respiration, 
[/78./] Of sixtie foure, parted in severall bands; 
Half to let out the smokie exhalation, 
The other half to draw in fresher windes: 
Beside both these, a third of both their kindes, 
That lets both out, & in; which no enforcement blindes. 
 
[}11}] 
This third the merrie [/79./] Diazome we call, 
A border-citie these two coasts removing; 
Which like a balk, with his crosse-builded wall, 
Disparts the terms of anger, and of loving; 
Keeps from th' Heart-citie fuming kitchin fires, 
And to his neighbours gentle windes inspires; 
[/80./] Loose when he sucks in aire, contract when he expires. 
 
[}12}] 
[/81./] The Diazome of severall matter's fram'd; 
The first moist, soft; harder the next, and drier: 
His fashion like the fish a Raia nam'd; 
Fenc'd with two walls, one low, the other higher; 
By eight streams water'd; two from Hepar low, 
And from th' Heart-town as many higher go; 
But two twice told down from the Cephal mountain flow. 
 
[^p.41^] 
[}13}] 
[/82./] Here sportfull Laughter dwells, here ever sitting, 
Defies all lumpish griefs, and wrinkled care; 
And twentie merrie-mates mirth causes sitting, 
And smiles, which Laughters sonnes, yet infants are. 
But if this town be fir'd with burnings nigh, 
With selfsame flames high Cephals towers fry; 
Such is their feeling love, and loving sympathie. 
 
[}14}] 
This coast stands girt with a [/83./] peculiar wall, 
The whole precinct, and every part defending: 
[/84./] The chiefest Citie, and Imperiall, 
Is fair Kerdia, farre his bounds extending; 
Which full to know were knowledge infinite: 
How then should my rude pen this wonder write, 
Which thou, who onely mad'st it, onely know'st aright? 
 
[}15}] 
In middle of this middle Regiment 
Kerdia seated lies, the centre deem'd 
Of this whole Isle, and of this government: 
If not the chiefest this, yet needfull'st seem'd, 
Therfore obtain'd an equall distant seat, 
More fitly hence to shed his life and heat, 
And with his yellow streams the fruitfull Island wet. 
 
[}16}] 
[/85./] Flankt with two severall walls (for more defence) 
Betwixt them ever flows a wheyish moat; 
In whose soft waves, and circling profluence 
This Citie, like and Isle, might safely float: 
In motion still (a motion fixt, not roving) 
Most like to heav'n in his most constant moving: 
Hence most here plant the seat of sure and active loving. 
 
[^p.42^] 
[}17}] 
Built of a substance like smooth porphyrie; 
[/86./] His matter hid, and (like it self) unknown: 
Two rivers of his own; another by, 
That from the Hepar rises, like a crown, 
Infold the narrow part: for that great All 
This his works glory made pyramicall; 
Then crown'd with triple wreath, & cloath'd in scarlet pall. 
 
[}18}] 
The Cities self in two [/87./] partitions rest; 
That on the right, this on the other side: 
[/88./] The right (made tributarie to the left) 
Brings in his pension at his certain tide, 
A pension of liquours strangely wrought; 
Which first by Hepars streams are hither brought, 
And here distill'd with art, beyond or words or thought 
 
[}19}] 
[/89./] The grosser waves of these life-streams (which here 
With much, yet much lesse labour is prepar'd) 
A doubtfull chanel doth to Pneumon bear: 
But to the lest those labour'd extracts shar'd, 
[/90./] As through a wall, with hidden passage slide; 
Where many secret gates (gates hardly spi'd) 
With safe convoy give passage to the other side. 
 
[}20}] 
At each hand of the left [/91./] two streets stand by, 
Of severall stuffe, and severall working fram'd, 
With hundred crooks, and deep-wrought cavitie: 
Both like the eares in form, and so are nam'd. 
I' th right hand street the tribute liquour sitteth: 
The left forc't aire into his concave getteth; 
Which subtile wrought, & thinne, for future workmen 
sitteth. 
 
[^p.43^] 
[}21}] 
The Cities [/92./] left side, (by some hid direction) 
Of this thinne aire, and of that right sides rent, 
(Compound together) makes a strange confection; 
And in one vessel both together meynt, 
Stills them with equall never-quenched firing: 
Then in small streams (through all the Island wiring) 
Sends it to every part, both heat and life inspiring. 
 
[}22}] 
[/93./] In this Heart-citie foure main streams appeare; 
One from the Hepar, where the tribute landeth, 
Largely poures out his purple river here; 
At whose wide mouth a band of Tritons standeth, 
(Three Tritons stand) who with their three-forkt mace 
Drive on, and speed the rivers flowing race, 
But strongly stop the wave, if once it back repace. 
 
[}23}] 
[/94./] The second is that doubtfull chanel, lending 
Some of this tribute to the Pneumon nigh; 
Whose springs by carefull guards are watcht, that sending 
From thence the waters, all regresse denie: 
[/95./] The third unlike to this, from Pneumon flowing, 
And his due ayer-tribute here bestowing, 
Is kept by gates and barres, which stop all backward going. 
 
[}24}] 
[/96./] The last full spring out of this left side rises, 
Where three fair Nymphs, like Cynthia's self appearing, 
Draw down the stream which all the Isle suffices; 
But stop back-waies, some ill revolture fearing. 
This river still it self to lesse dividing, 
At length with thousand little brooks runnes sliding, 
His fellow course along with Hepar chanels guiding. 
 
[^p.44^] 
[}25}] 
[/97./] Within this Citie is the palace fram'd, 
Where life, and lifes companion, heat, abideth; 
And their attendants, passions untam'd: 
(Oft very hell in this strait room resideth) 
And did not neighbouring hills, cold aires inspiring, 
Allay their rage and mutinous conspiring, 
Heat all (it self and all) would burn with quenchlesse firing. 
 
[}26}] 
Yet that great Light, by whom all heaven shines 
With borrow'd beams, oft leaves his loftie skies, 
And to this lowly seat himself confines. 
Fall then again, proud heart, now fall to rise: 
Cease earth, ah cease, proud Babel earth, to swell: 
Heav'n blast high towers, stoops to a low-rooft cell; 
First heav'n must dwell in man, then man in heav'n shall dwell. 
 
[}27}] 
Close to Kerdia [/98./] Pneumon takes his seat, 
Built of a lighter frame, and spungie mold: 
Hence rise fresh aires to fanne Kerdia's heat; 
Temp'ring those burning fumes with moderate cold: 
It self of largest size, distended wide, 
In divers streets and out-wayes multipli'd: 
Yet in one Corporation all are joyntly ti'd. 
 
[}28}] 
Fitly 't is cloath'd with hangings [/99./] thinne and light, 
Lest too much weight might hinder motion: 
His chiefest use to frame the voice aright; 
(The voice which publishes each hidden notion) 
And for that end [/100./] a long pipe down descends, 
(Which here it self in many lesser spends) 
Untill low at the foot of Cephal mount it ends. 
 
[^p.45^] 
[}29}] 
This pipe was built for th' aiers safe purveiance, 
To fit each severall voice with perfect sound; 
Therefore of divers matter the conveiance 
Is finely fram'd; the first in circles round, 
In hundred circles bended, hard and drie, 
(For watrie softnesse is sounds enemie) 
Not althogether close, yet meeting very nigh. 
 
[}30}] 
The seconds drith and hardnesse somewhat lesse, 
But smooth and pliable made for extending, 
Fills up the distant circles emptinesse; 
All in one bodie joyntly comprehending: 
[/101./] The last most soft, which where the circles scanted 
Not fully met, supplies what they have wanted, 
Not hurting tender parts, which next to this are planted 
 
[}31}] 
[/102./] Upon the top there stands the pipes safe covering, 
Made for the voices better modulation: 
Above it foureteen carefull warders hovering, 
Which shut and open it at all occasion: 
The cover in foure parts it self dividing, 
Of substance hard, fit for the voices guiding; 
One still unmov'd (in Thelu double oft) residing. 
 
[}32}] 
[/103./] Close by this pipe runnes that great chanel down, 
Which from high Cephals mount twice every day 
Brings to Koilia due provision: 
[/104./] Straight at whose mouth a floud-gate stops the way, 
Made like an Ivie leaf, broad-angle-fashion; 
Of matter hard, fitting his operation, 
For swallowing soon to fall, and rise for inspiration. 
 
[^p.46^] 
[}33}] 
But see, the smoak mounting in village nigh, 
With folded wreaths steals through the quiet aire; 
And mixt with duskie shades in Eastern skie, 
Begins the night, and warns us home repair: 
Bright Vesper now hath chang'd his name and place, 
And twinkles in the heav'n with doubtfull face: 
Home then my full-fed lambes; the night comes, home 
apace.
