[^f.B3v^] 
[}Here foloweth to shewe howe man 
chaungeth .xii. tymes, euen as the 
.xii. monthes dothe.}] 
 
YE muste take the fyrste .vi. yere 
for Ianyuere, the whiche is of 
no vertue nor strength, in that 
season no thynge on the earthe 
groweth. So man after that he 
is borne, tyll he be .vi. yeare of aege, is with 
lytell or no wytte, strengthe, or connynge, 
and maye do lytell or no thynge that commeth 
to profyte. 
 
Than co~meth Feueryere, and than the dayes 
longeth, & the Sonne is more hotter, than 
the feldes begyn to wax grene. So the other 
.vi. yere tyll he come to .xii. the chylde begynmeth 
to growe bygger, and is apte to lerne 
suche thynges as is taughte hym. 
 
Than co~meth the monthe of Marche. In 
whiche the labourer soweth the earth, & planteth 
trees, and edyfyeth howses, the chylde in 
these .vi. yeres waxeth bygge to lerne doctryne 
and scyence, and to be fayre and pleasau~t 
& louynge, for than he is .xviii. yere of aege. 
 
Than co~meth Apryll, that the erathe & the 
trees is coueryd with grene flowers. And in 
[^f.B4r^] 
enery partie goodes encreaseth habundauntly. 
Than co~meth y=e= yonge man to gather the 
swete flowers of hardynes, but than beware 
that the colde wyndes and stounes of vyces 
bete not downe the flowers of good maners, 
that shulde brynge man to honoure, for than 
is he .xxiiii. yeare of aege. 
 
Than co~meth May, that is both fayre and 
pleasaunt, for than byrdes synge in woddes 
and forestes nyght and daye, the Sonne shynyth 
hote, as than man is most lusty, myghty, 
and of delyuer strengthe, & seketh playes, 
sportes, and manly pastymes, for than is he 
full .xxx. yeares of aege. 
 
Than co~meth Iune, and than is the sonne 
at the hyghest in his Meridyonall, he may ascende 
no hygher in his stacion, his glemeringe 
golden beames rypeth the corne, and than 
man is .xxxvi. yere, he may ascende no more, 
For than nature hath gyuen hym courage & 
strengthe at the full, and rypeth the sedes of 
parfyte vnderstandynge. 
 
Than co~meth Iuly, that our fruyts be set 
on sonnynge, & our corne a hardenynge, but 
than the Sonne begynneth a lytell for to descende 
downewarde. So than man gothe fro 
youthe towarde aege, and begynneth for to 
[^f.B4v^] 
acquaynte hym with sadnes, for than he is 
come to .xlii. yeare. 
 
After that than co~meth August, than we 
gather in our corne, and also the fruyts of the 
erthe. And than man dothe his dylygence to 
gather for to fynde hym self to maynteyn his 
wyfe, chyldren, and his housholde whan aege 
co~meth on hym. And than after that .vi. yere, 
he is .xlviii. yeare of aege. 
 
Than co~meth Septembre, that wynes be 
made, and the fruits of the trees be gatheryd. 
And than there withall he dothe fresshely begyn 
to gernysshe his howse, and make prouysyon 
of nedefull thynges for to lyue with in 
wynter, whiche draweth very nere, and than 
man is in his most stedfast & couetous estate 
prosperous in wysedome, purposynge to gather 
and kepe, asmoch as shuld be suffycient 
for hym in his aege, whan he may gather no 
more, And than is he .liiii. yere of aege. 
 
And than co~meth Octobre, that all is into 
the foresayd house gathered both corne & also 
other maner of fruytes. And also the labourers 
plowe and sowe, newe sedes on the earth 
for the yere to come. And than he that nought 
soweth nought gathereth. And than in these 
.vi. yere a man shall take hym selfe vnto god 
[^f.C1r^] 
for to do penance and good werkes, & than 
the benefytes the yere after his deth he maye 
gather and haue spirituall profyte and than 
man is fully the terme of lx. yeres, 
 
Than co~meth nouembre, that the dayes be 
very shorte, and the Sonne in maner gyueth 
but lytel hete, and the trees losen theyr leuys. 
The feldes that were greene loketh hoore and 
graye, Than all maner of herbes ben hydde 
in the grou~de, and than apperyth no floures. 
And than wynter is come, that the ma~ hath 
vnderstandynge of aege and hathe loste his 
kyndely hete and strength. His tethe begyn to 
rot and to fayle hym. And than hath he lytell 
hope of longe lyfe, but desyreth to come to the 
lyfe euerlastynge. And these .vi. yeares make 
hym .lxvi. yere of aege. 
 
Than last cometh Decembre, full of colde 
with frostes and snowe, with great wyndes 
and stormy wethers, that a man may nat labour 
nor nought do. The sonne is than at the 
lowest that it maye descende. That the trees 
and the earthe be hyd in snowe than it is good 
to holde them nyghe the fyre and to spende the 
gooddes that they gat in somer. For than man 
begynneth to waxe croked & feble, couchynge 
and spyttynge, and loothsom, and than he loseth 
[^f.C1v^] 
his parfyte vnderstandyng, and his heyres 
desyre his deth. And these .vi. yere maketh 
hym ful .lxxii. yeres. And yf he lyue any longer, 
it is by his good guydyng, and dyetyng 
in his youth. Howe be it, it is possyble that a 
man may lyue tyll he be .C. yere of aege, but 
there be but fewe that lyueth so lo~ge tyl they 
come to a .C. yere of aege. 
 
Wherfore Ptholomeus saythe moreouer, 
that of lyuyng or dyeng, the heuenly bodyes 
may stere a man both to good & euyll, with-out 
doubte it is so. But yet maye man with-stande 
it by his owne fre wyll, to do what he 
wyll hym selfe, good or bad euermore. And 
about the whiche inclynacion is the myght & 
wyll of God, that longeth the lyfe of man by 
his goodness, or to make it short by iustyce. 
 
Wherfore I wyll shewe you of the bodyes 
Celestyall, and of theyr nature and mouynges, 
And this present boke hath to name the 
Compost of Ptholomens, for it comprehendeth 
fully all the compost, as dayes houres, 
and of the sonne & moone, & of the Sygnes 
that the moone is i~ euery day. And this boke 
was made for them that be lytell or no clerkes, 
to brynge them to more vnderstandyng 
and lernynge of many dyuerse thynges that 
[^f.C2r^] 
were necessary for them to haue knowleg of 
and to bere it in theyr mynde. 
 
[}Here foloweth to knowe the .xii. sygnes 
in theyr course reygnynge and rulynge. 
vpon the .xii. parties of ma~nes body: 
and whiche ben good for lettynge. 
of blode, & indifferent, or euyll. 
Capitulo. Primo.}] 
 
SO it is that I doo you 
knowlege that I say that 
a man is a lytel world by 
hym selfe; for the lykenesse 
and symylytudes, that he 
hathe is the great worlde, 
whiche is the aggregacion of the .ix. skyes 
foure, Elementes, and all thynges in them 
conteyned. Firste a man hathe suche a lykenes 
in the fyrste mobyle, that is the Soueraygne 
skye, and pryncipall parte of all the 
worlde, for lyke as in this fyrste mobyle, the 
zodake is deuyded in .xii. partyes, that ben 
the .xii. Sygnes. SO man is deuyded in .xii. 
parties, and holdeth of the synges eueryparte 
of his synge. The synges ben these Aries, 
Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, 
[^f.C2v^] 
Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, & 
Pisces. Of the whiche, thre ben of the nature 
of fyre, that is Aries, Leo and Sagittarius. 
And thre of nature of the ayre, Gemini, Libra, 
and Aquarius. And thre of the nature of 
water, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. And 
thre of the nature of the earth, Taurus, Virgo, 
& Capricornus. The first is Aries, that gouerneth 
the heed & the face of man, Taurus 
the necke & the throte bole, Gemini the shuldres, 
the armes, and the handes, Cancer the 
breste, sydes, mylte, and lyghttes. Leo the stomake, 
the herte, and the backe. Virgo the bely

the pryue partyes, the genytores, the bladder: 
and the fou~dyment, Sagittarius the thyghes 
onely. Capricornus also y=e= knees onely 
Aquarius the legges from the knees to the heles 
& ankles. And Pisces hath the fete in his 
domynyon. A man ought nat to make incysyon 
nor touche with yron, the membre gouerned 
of any sygne, the day that the moone 
is in it, for fere of the great effusyon of blode 
that myght happen, Nor in lykewyse whan 
the Sonne is in it, for the great daunger and 
peryll that myght folowe therof.

[}Here foloweth the Flubothomye with 
the names of the vaynes, and where 
they rest, and howe they ought to 
be letten blode. Cap~.iiii.}] 
 
HEre I do you to wyt, that 
the vayne in the myddes of 
the foreheed wold be letten 
blode, for the ache and payne 
of the heed, and for Feuers 
(Litargie) and for the 
megryme in the heed. 
 
About the .ii. eares behynde is .ii. Vaynes,

the which be let blode, to giue clere vnderstandyng, 
and vertue of lyght hearynge, and for

In the temple ben two vaynes, called the 
Artiers, for that they bete, which ben letten 
blode for to demynysshe and take awaye the 
great replexion & abundaunce of blode that 
is in the brayne, that might noy the heed and 
the eyen, and it is good against the gowte the 
megryme, and dyuers other Accidentes that 
may come to the heed. 
 
Vnder the Tonge ben two Vaynes, that 
ben letten blode for a sycknes called the Sequamy, 
and agaynst the swellynge, and appostomes 
of the throte, and agaynst the equynancy, 
by the which a man myght dye sodeinly, 
for defaute of suche bledynge. 
 
In the necke ben two vaynes called oryginalles, 
for that they haue the course & abundaunce 
of all the blod that gouerneth the body 
of man, & princypally the heed, but they 
ought not to be letten blode without the cou~seyle 
of the Surgion, and this bledyng auaileth 
moche to the syckenes of Leprye, whan it 
co~meth principally of the blode. 
 
The vayne of the herte taken in the arme, 
profyteth to take away humours or euyl blode, 
[^f.D2r^] 
that myght hurte the chambre of the herte 
or the apperteynaunce, and is good for them 
that spytteth blode, and that ben shorte wynded, 
by the whiche a man may dye sodaynly, 
for defaute of suche bledynge. 
 
The vayne of the lyuer taken in the arme 
aswaygeth the great hete of the body of man 
and holdeth the body in helthe, and this bledynge 
is profytable also agaynst the yelowe 
axes, and appostome of the lyuer, & agaynst 
the palsy wherof a man may dye, for defaute 
of suche bledynge. 
 
Bytwene the maister fynger and the leche 
fynger to lette blode helpeth the dolours that 
cometh in the stomake and sydes, as botches, 
and appostomes, and dyuers other accydents 
that may come to those places by great abou~daunce 
of blode and humours. 
 
In the sydes bytwene the wombe and the 
braunche ben two vaynes, of the whiche that 
of the right syde is letten blode for the dropsy 
& that of the lefte syde for euery syckenes that 
cometh aboute the mylte, and they shuld blede 
after the persons be fat or leane, take good 
hede at foure fyngers nyghe the incysion: and 
they ought nat to make suche bledynge without 
the counsayle of the Surgyon. 
 
[^f.D2v^] 
In euery fote ben thre vaynes, of the whiche 
thre, one is vnder the ancle of the fote named 
sophane, the whiche is letten blode for to 
swage and put out dyuers humours, as botches 
and appostemes that cometh aboute the 
graynes, and it profyteth moche to women, 
for to cause theyr menstruosyte to discende, &

day, that is to saye within .xxiiii. houres 
after that the syckenesse is taken of the pacyent, 
and before that the feuer come on hym, & 
this bledynge ought to be done after that corpolence 
of the pacyent. 
 
In the angels of the iyen ben two vaynes 
the whiche ben letten blode, for the rednes of 
the iyen, or watry or that renneth contynually: 
& for dyuers other syckenes that may happen, 
and come by ouer great abundaunce of 
humours and blode 
 
In the vayne of the ende of the nose is made 
[^f.D3r^] 
a bledynge, the whiche is good for a redde 
pympled face, as ben red droppes, pustulus 
small shabbes, & other infecions of the herte 
that maye come therin by to great repleccion 
and abundaunce of blode and humours, and 
it auayleth moche agaynste popeled noses, & 
other lyke sycknesses. 
 
In the mouth in the gu~mes ben foure vaynes, 
that is to saye two aboue, & two byneth

Bytwene the lyppe & the chynne is a vayne, 
that is letten blode to gyue amendement 
to them that haue an euyll breth. 
 
In eche arme ben foure vaynes of the whiche 
the vayne of the hed is the hyghest, the seconde 
nexte is from the herte, the thurde is of 
the lyuer, & the fourth is from the mylte other 
wyse called the lowe lyuer vayne. 
 
The vayne of the hed taken in the arme 
ought to blede, for to take away the great repleccion 
and abundaunce of blode that maye 
anoye the hed, the iyen, and the brayne, & auayleth 
greatly for chaungeable hetes, and swellyng 
faces and red, and for dyuers other sycknesses 
that may fall and come by great abundaunce 
of blode. 
 
[^f.D3v^] 
The vayne of the mylte, otherwyse called 
the lowe vayne shuld blede agaynst feuer tercyens 
and quartaynes, and in it ought to be 
made a wyde and a lesse depe wounde: than 
in any other vayne, for fere of wynde that 
it maye gather, and for a more inco~uenyence 
for fere of a senowe that is vnder it, that is 
called the lezarde. 
 
In eche hande ben thre vaynes, wherof 
that aboue the thombe ought to blede, to take 
awaye the great hete of the vysage, & for moche 
thycke blode and humours, that ben in the 
hed, and this vayne delayth more than that

whan they haue to great abundaunce. 
 
[}Thus endeth the Flubothomye. And here 
foloweth to knowe whan a man is hole or 
dysposed to syckenes. Capitulo. v.}] 
 
HOwe to gyue you knowledge, 
whan that any man is hole or 
sycke, or disposed in any wyse 
to syckenes: wherfore thre 
thyng~ there ben: by the whiche 
Ptholomeus put knowlege whan a man is 
hole or sycke, or disposed to sickenes. If he be 
hole, to maynteyne & kepe hym. If he be sicke 
to seke remedye to hele hym. If he be disposed 
to syckenes, to kepe hym that he fale nat ther 
in. And for eche of thre sayde thynges the 
sayd Pholomeus put dyuers sygnes. Helthe 
properly attemperaunce, accorde, and equalyte 
of the .iiii. qualytes of man, which ben hote 
colde drye, & moyste. The whiche whan they 
ben well tempred and egall that the one surmount 
nat the other, than the body of man is 
hole. But whan they ben vnegall and mysse-tempred, 
[^f.D4v^] 
and the one hath power one ouer an 
other, than a man is sycke or disposed to sickenes, 
and they ben the qualytes that the body 
holdeth of the elementes that they ben made & 
composed of, that is to saye of the fyre hete, of 
the water colde, of the ayre moyste, and & of 
erthe drye. The whiche qualytes, whan one 
is disordred from the other, than the body is 
sycke. And if that one distroye all the other, 
than the body dyeth, and the soule departeth. 
 
[}The sygne to knowe a man hole, and 
well disposed in his body. Capitulo. vi.}] 
 
THe firste sygne wherby Ptholomeus 
knewe a man to be hole, and 
well disposed in his body, was, 
whan he eteh and drynketh well 
after the conuenaunce of the hunger & thyrste 
that he hath without makynge excesse. And 
also whan he dygesteth lyghtly, and whan 
that he hathe eten or drynken it troubleth and 
greuyth nat his stomacke. Also whan he feleth 
good sauoure & good appetyte in that he 
eteth and drynketh. Also whan he is hungry 
and thursty at the houres that he ought to ete 
and drynke. And also whan he reioyseth hym 
[^f.E1r^] 
with folke. Also whan thay playe gladly in 
the feldes and gardens to take the swete ayre 
and sporte in the medowes by water sydes. 
Also whan he eteth gladly & with good appetite 
of butter, chese, & flawnes withoute leuynge 
any thynge in his dysshe to send to the 
almesse house. Also whan he slepeth well and 
suerly without rauynge or dremynge of his 
besynes. Also whan he feleth hym lyght: and 
that he walketh well. And whan he sweteth 
soone, and that he nyseth lytell or nothynge. 
Also whan he is nother to fatte nor to leane, 
Also whan he hath good coloure in his face, 
and that his wyttes ben all well disposed for 
to do theyr operacion, as his eyen for to se his 
eres to here, his nose to smell. &c. And I leue 
of the conuenaunce of the aege the disposicion 
of the body, & also of tyme. Of other sygnes 
I say nothynge: but these most suffyse for the 
pore lay people, to know the sygnes of helth. 
 
[}These sygnes ben contraye to them afore-sayde, 
by the whiche Ptholomeus knewe 
whan he or other were sycke. Cap~. vii.}] 
 
FIrst whan he may nat wel ete nor drinke 
or that he haue none appetite to ete at dyner 
[^f.E1v^] 
and supper, or whan he fyndeth noo Sauoure 
in that he eteth or drynketh, or that he 
is hungry and may not ete, whan his dygestyon 
is nat good, or that it be to longe. Also 
wha~ he goth to cha~bre moderately as he ought 
to do. Also whan he is pensyue, sadde, sorye, 
or heuy in ryght ioyous or cherefull companyes; 
than syckenes constrayneth a man to 
be thoughtfull. Semblably whan he maye 
nat slepe nor take his rest a ryght and at due 
houre with quyetnes, as is requysyte for all 
helthfull persons to haue. And also whan 
his membres ben heuy, as his hed, his legges, 
and armes, with other membres. And also 
whan he may nat walke easely and lyghtly 
and that he spueth ofte, & his colour is pale or 
yelowe, or whan his wyttes, as his iyen his 
eres, and other do nat kyndely theyr operacyons. 
In lykewyse whan he may nat labour 
and trauayle. Also whan he forgetteth lyghtly 
that which of necessyte ought to be kept in 
memory, & whan hy spytteth often, or whan 
his nose thrylles abou~deth in superfluous humours. 
And whan he is neclygent in his workes: 
and whan his flesshe is blowen or swollen 
in the vysage, in his legges, or his fete, or 
whan his iyen ben holowe in his hed. These 
[^f.E2r^] 
ben the sygnes that sygnyfyeth a man beyng 
in syckenes, & who that hath moste of the foresayd 
sygnes, moste is infecte with syckenes. 
 
[}Other sygyes almoste semblable to them 
aforesayd, and sheweth the replection of 
euyll humours, and for to be purged of 
them. Capitulo. viii.}] 
 
REplection is a fulnesse of euyll 
humours, and dysposycion of 
syckenes after the opynyon of 
Ptholomeus, of the which replection 
is to knowe, howe to purge 
the sayd humours, that they engendre no sicknes, 
& ben knowen by the sygnes y=t= foloweth. 
First whan a man hath ouer great rednes in 
his face, & handes, or in his nayles, hauynge 
also his vaynes full of blod, or bledeth to moche 
at the nose, or to ofte, or hath payne in the 
forehed. Also whan his eres soundeth & whan 
his eyen water, or be full of gu~me & hathe his 
vnderstandyng trobled, & whan the poulx beteth 
to faste, & whan the bely is longe resolute 
& laxe, & whan he hath the syght troubled, 
and eatynge also without appetyte. And by 
all these & other sygnes beforesayd one maye 
[^f.E2v^] 
knowe the body euyll disposed, & full of corrupte 
humours superfluous and euyll. 
 
[}A dyuysyon and Regymente of tyme, the 
whiche Ptholomeus vsed, after that the 
season and tyme required. Cap. ix.}] 
 
AS for to remedye the syckenesses, 
and infyrmytyes that 
a man hathe, and to kepe 
hym from theym, that ben 
doubted to come, Ptholomeus 
saythe that the tyme, 
naturally chaungeth foure tymes in the yere: 
and so they deuyde the yere in foure quarters, 
that is Vere, Somer, Haruest, and wynter, 
And in eche of these quarters he dyd gouerne 
hym as the seasons requyred to his mynde, & 
the better it was for hym. And as the season 
chaungeth, so chau~ged he his maner of lyuynge 
and doynge, and sayth that chaungynge 
of tyme without takynge good hede often engendreth 
infyrmytes, for that one tyme behoueth 
nat, to vse some metes that ben good in 
another tyme, as that vsed in wynter is not 
all good in Somer, & so of the other seasons. 
 
And for to knowe the chaungynge of tyme 
[^f.E3r.^] 
after these sayd quarters or seasons, they consyder 
the course of the Sonne by the .xii. Sygnes, 
& say that euery of the sayd foure quarters 
and seasons dureth _[^ORIG. BLURRED^] Monthes, and 
that the Sonne passeth by thre signes: that is 
to wete in Prime tyme by Pisces, Aries, and 
Taurus, and these ben the monthes, February, 
Marche, and Apryll, that the erthe & trees 
reioyseth and chargeth with grene leues and 
flours, that is a pleasur to beholde. In somer 
by Gemini, Cancer, and Leo, and the monethes 
ben Maye Iune, and Iuly, that the fruytes 
of the erthe groweth and rypeth. In haruest 
by Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio, and the 
monethes ben August, Septembre, & Octobre, 
that the erth & trees dischargeth the fruyt~ 
and leues, and that tyme euery body felleth & 
gaderyth the fruytes. In wynter by Sagittarius, 
Capricornus, and Aqarius, and the 
monethes ben Nouembre, Decembre, and Ianuary, 
that the erthe and trees ben as deed & 
vnclothed of leues, fruytes, & of all grenesse. 
After the whiche .iiii. seasons, Ptholomeus 
deuysen the tyme that man maye lyue in .iiii. 
aeges, as youth, strength, and decrepyte, and 
lykened to the foure seasons of the yere. That 
is to wete, youth to Pryme tyme that is hote 
[^f.E3v^] 
and moyste: and as the herbes and trees of the 
erthe groweth, so dothe man in youthe vnto .xxv. 
yere growe of body, in strength beaute & 
vygoure. Strength is lykened vnto Somer 
hote and drye, and the body of man is in force 
and vygoure, and enrypeth vnto .xlv. yere. 
Aege is compared vnto the tyme of Haruest 
colde and drye that man leueth of growynge 
and febleth, and thynketh howe to gather and 
spare for fere of defaute & nede that he cometh 
stoupynge aege, and dureth to .lvi. yeres. 
Decrepyte is lykened to the season of wynter 
colde and moyste by aboundaunce of colde humours 
& defaute of naturall hete, in the whiche 
tyme man spendeth that which he had gatheryd 
and kepte in tyme passed, and if he haue 
spared no thynge, he a abydeth pore and naked, 
as the erthe and trees, and dureth vnto. lxxii. 
yere or more. Prymetyme is hote and 
moyst, nature of ayre, and complection of the 
sanguyne. Somer is hote and drye, nature 
of fyre, & complection of the coloryke. Haruest 
is colde and drye, nature of erthe, & complection 
of melancoly. Wynter is cold and 
moyste, nature of water, complection of the 
flumatyke. whan complection is well proporcyoned, 
it feleth it selfe better disposed in the 
[^f.E4r^] 
tyme semblable to it, than it dothe in other tymes. 
But for that euery man is nat well complectioned, 
they ought to do as Ptholomeus 
dyd, that is to take Regymente to kepe themselfe 
after the seasons, and gouerne them by 
his rules and teachynges, the whiche he vsed 
in euery quarter of the yere for to lyue the longer, 
wysely and meryly. 
 
[}The Regyme~nt for Prymetyme, that is for 
to say Marche, Apryll, & May. Cap~. x.}] 
 
IN prymetyme Ptholomeus 
kepte hym selfe metely well 
clothed, nat ouer colde, nor 
to hote, as woth thyn vestures, 
dowbletes of sylke, and 
Gownes metely lyghte furred 
with lambe most commenly. In this tyme 
is very good lettynge of blode to auoyde the 
euyll humours that were gatheryd in the body 
the wynter tyme. If syckenes happen in 
Prymetyme it is nat of his nature, but procedeth 
of the humours gatheryd in the wynter 
passed. Prymetyme is a temperat tyme to take 
medycynes for them that ben corprat and 
full of thycke humours, to purge them. Also 
[^f.E4v^] 
in this tyme men oughte to ete lyght meates/ 
that refressheth as chekynes, kyddes with vergyous, 
borage, betes yolkes of egges in moone 
shyne poched, roches, perches, pykerelles. 
& all scaled fysshe. Also to drynke temperate 
wyne, bere or ale, so that they be nat to stronge 
nor ouer swete, for in this tyme all swete 
thynges ought nat to be vsed, & man ought 
nat to slepe longe in the mornynge, and nat 
on the daye. The Astronomyers haue a generall 
rule, or custome for al seasons, that auayleth 
moche agaynst all infyrmytes and syckenesses, 
that is nat to lose his appetyte for etynge, 
and neuer for to ete without hunger. Also 
they saye that all maner flesshe and fysshe is 
better rosted than soden, and if they be soden 
to broyle on a grydeyron, or on the coles, and 
they ben the more holsomer. 
 
[}The Regyment for the tyme of Somer, 
that is Iune, Iuly, and August. Ca. xi.}] 
 
THe Astronomyers in Somer ben clothed 
with lyghte gownes and syngle 
theyr shyrtes, & shetes that they lye in ben lynnen, 
for of all the clothes it is the coldest, they 
haue dowblettes of sylke, or of canuas, and 
[^f.F1r^] 
they ete lyght metes, as chekyns with vergyous, 
yonge rabetes, lectuse, purslayne, melo~s 
coucombres, peres, plu~mes, and such fysshes 
as are before named. And also they ete of metes 
that refressheth, also they ete lytell and often, 
they breke theyr faste or dyne i~ the morenynge, 
or euer the Sonne aryse, and go to supper 
or it discende, & they ete of the abouesayd 
metes, & soure sauce to gyue them an appetyte. 
They ete but lytell salte metes, and refrayne 
them from scratchynge, they drinke many 
tymes fresshe water soden with sugercandy, 
and also with other refressynge waters, and 
they do it alway whan that they ben greatly 
thrysty, saue onely at dyner and at suppertyme, 
for than they drynke feble grene wyne, 
or small ale, or syngle bere. And also they kepe 
them from ouer great trauayle, or ouer forsynge 
of them self, for in this tyme is nothynge 
more greuous, nor contageous than chaufynge. 
In this tyme & season they do eschewe 
the company of women, and they bathe them 
ofte in colde water to aswage the hete of theyr 
Bodyes enforced by laboures. Alwaye they 
haue with them sugre candy, or other sugre & 
dradges, wherof they take lytell & often and 
euery daye in the morenynge, they force them 
[^f.F1v^] 
by cowchynge and spyttynge to voyde fleumes: 
and voyde them aboue & byneth the best 
that thay may, and wasshe theyr handes with 
fresshe water, theyr vysage and mouthe. 
 
[}The regyment for Haruest, is Septembre, 
Octobre, and Nouembre. Ca. xii.}] 
 
BE it to vnderstande, in Haruest 
Astronomiers be clothed, 
after the maner of primetyme 
but theyre clothes ben a lytell 
warmer. And in this time thei 
Do theyr dylygence to purge 
and clense them, and lettynge them blode to 
tempre the humour of theyr bodyes For it is 
the moste contagyous tyme of the yere, in the 
whiche peryllous infyrmytes happeneth and 
cometh, and therfore they eate good holsome 
metes, as Capons, hennes, yonge pegyons 
that begyn to flye, and drynke good wynes 
and other good and holsome drynkes, without 
takynge excesse. In this tyme they kepe 
them from etynge of fruytes, for it is a daungerous 
season for the axes, and they say that 
he had neuer axes that neuer ete fruyte. In 
this tyme they drynke no water, and they, 
[^f.F2r^] 
put no parte of them in colde water, but their 
handes & theyr faces They kepe theyr heedes 
from colde in the nyght and morenynge, and 
slepe nat in the noone tyme: & kepe them from 
ouer great trauayle, and endure nat to moch 
hunger nor thyrste, but ete whan it is tyme, & 
nat whan theyr mawes be full. 
 
[}The Regyment for wynter Tyme, is 
Decembre, Ianuarye, and Februarye. 
Cap. xiii.}] 
 
MOreouer as Ptholomeus dyd, 
the Astronomyers nowe dothe 
in wynter clothe them in thycke 
gownes of roughe clothe, 
hye shorne well furred, withe 
foxe furre. For it is the warmest furre that is 
and cattes, lambes, and dyuers other thycke 
furres that ben good & holsome. In the tyme 
of Wynter Astronomyers do ete befe, & porke, 
and brawne, hartes, hyndes, and all maner, 
of venyson, partryches, fesauntes, and fowles 
of the ryuer, and other metes that thy loue 
best. For that is the season of the yere that 
nature suffereth moste great plente of vytayle, 
for the naturall hete that is drawen with-in 
[^f.F2v^] 
the body. In this tyme also they drynke often 
stro~ge wynes after theyr complection, as 
bastarde wyne, or osey. Two or thre tymes 
in the weke they vse good spyces in theyr metes. 
For this is the moste holsome tyme of all 
the yere, in the whiche cometh no syckenesse, 
but by great excesses & outrages done to nature, 
or by euyll gouernynge. Astronomyers 
say also that Prymtyme is hote and moyste 
of the nature of the ayre, complection of the 
Sanguyne, and that in the same tyme nature 
reioyseth, and the poores openethe, and the 
blode spredeth through the vaynes more than 
in any other tyme. Somer is hote and drye 
of the nature of the fyre, and of complection 
coloryke. In the whiche tyme one ought to kepe 
hym from all thynges that moueth to hete 
all excesse and hote metes. Haruest is colde & 
drye of nature of erthe, & complection of mela~coly, 
In the whiche tyme one ought to kepe 
hym from doynge excesse, more than in other 
tyme for daunger of syckenes, to the whiche 
that tyme is disposed. But wynter is colde & 
moyste of the nature of water, and of complection 
flumatyke, than a man oughte for to 
kepe hym metely warme, and meanely for to 
lyue in helthe of body. 
 
[^f.F3r^] 
[}Here after foloweth the .iiii. elementes, and 
the .iiii. complections of man. Cap. xiiii.}] 
 
THese they ben Ayre, Fyre, Erthe, 
and water. The .xxiiii. houres of 
the daye & the nyght ruleth Sanguyne, 
Coloryke, Melancoly, and 
Flumatyke. Syxe houres after 
mydnyght blode hath the maystry, and in the 
vi. houres before noone Coloure reynethe, 
and .vi houres after noone reygneth Melancoly, 
and the .vi. houres before mydnyght reygneth 
the Flumatyke. 
 
[}Here foloweth the Astrology of Ptholomeus. 
Capitulo. xv.}] 
 
SO as Ptholomeus and also 
dyuers other Astrologyens 
gyueth vs knowledge 
of the mouynges and propreyetes 
of the Heuens: and 
dyuers other thynges contayned 
in this present Compost, 
the whiche is so that eche other may co~pryse 
and knowe as they do. First one ought 
to knowe what the Fygure is, the disposycion 
[^f.F3v^] 
of the worlde, the nombre and ordre of the 
Elementes, and the mouynges of the skyes, 
appertayneth to be knowen of euery man of 
good and noble wytte. For it is a fayre thynge, 
delectable profytable, & honest, and ther-with 
it is necessarye for to haue dyuers other 
knowleges, and specially the Astrology of 
Ptholomeus, whiche sheweth how the worlde 
is rounde as a balle. And after wyse men 
saye that there is no thynge so rounde as it is 
For it is rounder than any thyng artificiall. 
Yet moreouer in this worlde we se no thynge 
nor neuer shall, that is so iuste & egally rounde 
as it selfe is, and it composed of the heuen 
and the .iiii. Elementes in .v. pryncypall partyes. 
After that a man ought to knowe that 
the erthe is in the myddes of the worlde, for it 
is the heuyest element. And vpon the erthe is 
the water or the see, but it coueryth nat all the 
erth, to thende that men & best~ may lyue ther 
in, and the partye that is vncoueryd is called 
the face of the erthe, for it is as the face of ma~ 
alwayes vncoueryd, and the partye that is, 
coueryd with water is the body of man that 
is clothed & hydde. On the water is the ayre 
that encloseth the erthe and the water, and is 
deuyded in thre Regyons, one is lowe where 
[^f.F4r^] 
as enhabyteth beestes and byrdes, another is 
meane where as ben the cloudes, the, whiche 
make the Impressions as lyghtnynges, thondres, 
and other, and is alwaye colde, and the 
thyrde is the hyest, where as is neyther wynde 
nor rayne, nor tempest, nor other impression, 
and there ben some mountaynes that attayneth 
vnto it as is Olympus that techyth 
the hyest Regyon of the ayre, and the element 
of fyre mounteth vnto the skye, and the elementes 
sustayneth the skyes, as the pyllers or 
postes sustayneth a house. Of suche mou~taynes 
is one in Affryke named Athlas. After 
that is the eleme~t of fyre, that is neyther flambe 
nor coles, but is pure and inuisible: for the 
great bryghtnes, for of so moche as the water 
is more clere and lyght than the erthe, and the 
ayre more clere and lyght than the water, of 
so moche the fyre is more clere, lyght, & fayrer 
than the ayre: and the skyes in equipolent ben 
more clerer, lyghter, and fayrer than the fyre, 
The whiche tourneth with the mouynges of 
the heuens, and the nexte Regyon of the ayre 
also, in the whiche is engendred comytes that 
ben called sterres, for that they ben shynynge 
and moueth as the sterres. After the sayinge 
of Ptholomeus and other Astronomyers the 
[^f.F4v^] 
fyre is inuysible for his subtylyte and nat for 
his clerenes, for of as moche as a thyng is more 
clere, of so moche it is more vysyble, for we 
se the skyes wel, but nat the fyre for it is ouer 
moche more subtyle than the ayre that is inuysyble 
for the same cause, the erthe and the water 
ben thycke, and therfore they ben vysyble 
 
The skyes ben neyther properly heuye nor 
lyght, harde nor softe, clere nor derk, hote nor 
colde, swete nor soure coloure nor sonne, nor 
suche other qualytes, saufe that they ben hote 
in vertue: for they may cause hete here byneth 
by theyr lyghtnes, mouyngs, and influences, 
and ben improperly harde, for they maye nat 
be deuyded nor broken. And also they ben improperly 
coloures of lyght in some partyes, & 
ben thycke, as ben the partyes of the sterres. 
In the whiche there maye no sterre, nor other 
partye be adiusted and put to, nor none may 
be demynysshed nor taken awaye, and they 
maye neyther encrease nor waxe lesse, nor be 
of other fygure than rou~de, nor they may nat 
chaunge, enpayre, nor waxe olde, nor be corrumped 
nor altered, but in lyght onely, as in 
tyme of the eclyps of the Sonne and Moone, 
nor they maye nat reste and stande styll, nor 
tourne onelye otherwyse, later nor sooner, in 
[^f.G1r^] 
partye nor in all, nor behaue them otherwyse 
than after theyr comyn course, but by miracle 
deuyne, and therfore sterres and skies ben 
of another nature, than the elementes and the 
thyngs in them co~posed, the whiche ben transmutable 
and corruptyble. The element~ and 
all thynges of them composed, ben enclosed 
withe the firste skye, as the yelke of an egge is 
enclosed within the whyte, and the firste skye 
is enclosed of the seconde, and the seconde in 
the thyrd, and the thyrde in the fourth, and so 
of other. The firste skye next the elemente is 
the skye of the Mone. And next it is the skye 
of Mercury. And next it the skye of Venus. 
Than is the skye of the Sonne. And nexte 
that the skye of Mars. Than is next the skye 
of Iupiter. And than nexte after that is the 
skye of Saturne. And thus ben the skyes of 
the planett~ after theyr ordre. The eyght sky 
is of sterres fyxed, and they ben called so, for 
that they moue more regulerly and after one 
guyse than the planettes do. And than aboue 
that is the first mobyle, in the whiche no thynge 
apperyth that Astrologyens may se. There 
ben some Astrologyens say that aboue these 
.ix. skyes is one immobyle, for it tourneth 
nat; and aboue that is one of Crystall, ouer 
[^f.G1v^] 
the whiche is the skye Imperyall, in the whiche 
is the throne of god, of the whiche skye the 
Astrologyens ought nat to speke, but onely 
of the firste mobyle, and that is contayneth al 
togyther called the worlde. Of one thynge 
they meruayle moche, that is howe god hath 
distrybuted the sterres, that he hath put none 
in the nynthe skye and hathe put so many in 
they eyght sky that they may not be nombred 
and in eche of the other .vii. but one onely, as 
aforesayde of the sonne, moone, and sters, as 
euydently apperyth hereafter. 
 
[}Here Ptholomeus shewethe more playnly 
of the foure Elementes, and of the symylytude 
of the erthe, and howe that euery, Planet 
is one aboue another, & sheweth whiche 
of them ben masculyne, as these fyue 
Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Sol, & Mercury. 
And of .ii. femynyn, as Venus, & 
Luna, and whiche of them is northly, 
& southly, and whiche ben oryentall 
or occydentall. Capitulo. xvi.}] 
 
SOme Mouyng ben of the skyes and planettes, 
that excedeth the vnderstandynge 
of the Astrologyens as the mouyge of the 
[^f.G2r^] 
fyrmamente, in the whiche ben the sterres agaynst 
the firste mobyle in an .C. yeare one 
degre, and the mouynge of the planettes in 
theyr episcycles, of the whiche howe well that 
Astronomyers be nat ygnoraunt of all, yet 
they make no mencyon here, for it suffysethe 
them onely of two, wherof the one is from 
oryent in to the occodent aboue the erth, and 
from occydent in to the oryent vnder it, that 
is called the dyurnal mouynge, that is to say 
that it maketh from day to day xxiiii. hours 
by the whiche mouynge the .ix. skye, that is the 
firste mobyle draweth after, and maketh the 
other skyes to tourne that ben vnder it. The 
other moment is of the .vii. Planettes, and 
is from occydent to oryent aboue the earthe, 
and from oryent in to the occident vnder it & 
is contrary to the firste, and ben the two mouynges 
that Astrologyens knowlegeth, and 
howe well that they ben oposytes, yet moue 
they contynually, and ben possyble, as it is 
shewed by ensample. If a shyp on the see cam 
from oryent in to occident, and that he of his 
owne mouynge went in the shyp softelye to-warde 
orient. Semblably the planettes ben 
transported with theyr skye from oryent in to 
occident by the dyurnall mouyng of the fyrst 
[^f.G2v^] 
mobyl. But later & otherwyse than the fyxed 
sterres, by that that euery planet hath his propre 
mouynge contrary to the mouynge of sterres, 
For the mone maketh a course lesse i~ a moneth 
aboute the erth than a sterre fyxed &, the 
son~e a course lesse in a yere, and the other planetes 
in cartayne tyme eche after the qua~tyte 
of his mouynge. Thus it apperyth that the 
planettes moue two mouynges. Ptholomeus 
saythe, pose by ymagynacion that all the 
skyes seased to moue of the dayly mouynge, 
the moone wolde make a course in goynge 
from the occydent in to the oryent in as moch 
tyme as lasteth now .xxvii. dayes, and .viii. 
houres, and Marcury, Venus, and Sol, wolde 
make in lyke maner course in the space of 
a yere, and Mars in two yere, and Saturne 
in .xxx. yere or ther aboute. For now they make 
theyr course of reuolucione, & acomplisshe 
theyr propre mouynges in the tyme here named. 
The propre mouynge of planett~ is nat 
streyghte from occydent to oryent, but it is a 
syde waye, and Astrologyens se them sensyble. 
For whan they se the moone before a sterre 
one nyght, the seconde, or the thirde nyght/ 
it is behynde nat streyghte towarde oryent/ 
but shall be drawen one tyme towarde Septemtryon/ 
[^f.G3r^] 
and another tyme towarde mydday/ 
& this is bycause of the latytude or largnes 
of the zodyake/ in the whiche ben the .xii. 
sygnes, vnder whom the planettes reygneth 
 
[}Of the equynoccial and zodyake: that ben 
in the .ix. skyes that contayneth the fyrmament 
vnder it. Capitulo. xviiii.}] 
 
AS in the concaue of the first 
mobyle Ptholomeus & other 
Astrologyens ymagyneth to 
be the ii. cyrcles/ and they ben 
ther royall/ the one is as smal 
as a lytell threde/ & it is caled 
equynocciall/ and the other is large in maner 
of a gyrdle or as a garlande of floures/ whiche 
they do cal the zodyake/ and these two cyrcles 
deuydeth the one and the other equaly/ & 
but nat streyght/ for the zodyake crosseth crokedly/ 
& the places where it croketh/ ben sayd 
equynoccial. For to vnderstand the equynocciall/ 
we se sensybly all the skye tourne from 
oryent in occydent/ and it is called the dayly 
mouynge/ or dyuernal mouynge/ than ought 
one to ymagyn a streyght lyne that passethe 
throughe the mydle of the erth co~myng from 
[^f.G3v^] 
the one ende of the skye to the other about the 
lyne is made this mouynge, & the two endes 
ben the two poyntes in the skye that moueth 
nat/ and ben called the poles of the worlde/ of 
the whiche poles/ one is ouer vs by the sterre 
of the northe/ that alwayes demonstreth hym 
self and aperith to vs/ and is the pole artyke 
or septemtryonall/ and the other is vnder the 
erthe alwayes hyd called the pole antertyke/ 
or pole australl/ in the myddle of the whiche 
poles/ in the firste mobyle/ is the cyrcle equynocciall 
equally before in the partye/ as in 
the other of the sayde poles/ and after this cyrcle 
is made and mesured the dayly mouynge 
of .xxiiii. houres that is a natural daye/ and 
it is called equynoccyall For that whan the 
sonne is in it/ that daye and the nyght ben 
equal thorghe the world. The large zodyak 
as sayd is in the first mobyle/ and also it is a 
gyrdle manerly fygured and sette with ymages 
of sygnes entrayled subtylly and well 
composed/ and sette with fyxed sterres/ as 
shynyng Carbuncles or precyous Gemmes 
full of great vertue/ sette by maystryse right 
nobly aourned. in the whiche zodyak ben .iiii. 
principall poyntes/ that deuideth them equallye 
in .iiii. partyes. One is hye called the solstyce 
[^f.G4r^] 
of Somer/ whiche whan the sonne is entred 
in Cancer/ it is the longest day of somer. 
Another is lowe called the Solstyce of wynter. 
whiche is whan the sonne is entred in Caprycorne/ 
than it is the shortest day of wynter 
and meane called equynoccyall of Haruest/ 
that the sonne entreth in Libra in the moneth 
of Septembre And the other is caled the equynoccyal 
of Prymtyme/ that the sone entreth 
in Aries in the moneth of Marche. The whiche 
.iiii. partyes deuydeth eche i~ thre egal partyes/ 
and maketh .xii. partyes/ that ben caled 
sygnes/ as Aries/ Taurus/ Gemini/ Cancer 
Leo/ Virgo/ Libra/ Scorpio/ Sagittarius/ 
Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces. Aquarius 
begenneth in equynoccyall and crosseth 
the zodyake, and whan the sonne is there it 
begynneth to declyne, that is to saye, approchynge 
Septemtryon, and toward vs it extendeth 
to the oryent. Than is Taurus seconde, 
Gemini the third, and so of al the other. Also 
euery sygne is deuyded in .xxx. degrees, and 
be i~ the zodiake .CCC.lx. degres, & euery degre 
deuyded by lx mynutes, euery mynut in 
lx. secondes, euery seconde in .lx. thyrdes and 
this partycion and deuysyon suffyseth to be 
vnderstande of Astronomyers. 
 
[^f.G4v^] 
[}Here after foloweth a very subtyll varyacion 
in the skye. Capitulo. xix.}] 
 
THe Astronomyers do knowlege a 
very subtyl variacio~ i~ the sky, and 
is for the steres fyxed be nat vnder 
the same degres of the zodiak that 
were created bycause of y=e= mouyng 
of the fyrmament, the which ben agaynst the 
firste mobyle in a .C. yere of one degre, for the 
whiche mutacyon the sonne maye haue other 
regarde to a starre, and other syngnyficacion 
than it had in the tyme passed, and also whan 
that bokes were made, for that the sterre hath 
chaunged his degree or sygne vnder whiche it 
was. And this often tymes causeth them that 
make Pronostycacyons. and Iugementes 
comynge to fayle. All the cyrcles of the skye 
ben narowe and small, excepte the zodyake, 
whiche is large, & co~tayneth in length .CCClx. 
degrees, and of largenesse .xii the whiche 
largenesse is deuyded by the mydes .vi. degre 
on that one sygne, and .vi on the other, & this 
dyuysion is made by a lyne named Ecliptike 
is the waye of the sonne, for the sonne neuer 
departeth vnder that lyne, & thus it is alway 
in the mydel of the zodyake, but the other planettes 
[^f.H1r^] 
ben alwayes on the one syde, or on the 
other of the sayd lyne, saue whan they ben in 
the heade or the tayle of the Dragon, as the 
Moone passeth twyse in a moneth, and yf it 
happen whan that it reneweth it is Eclypse 
of the sonne, & yf it happen in the full moone 
and y=t= it be ryght vnder the nadyr of the son~e 
it is generall eclypse, and if it be but a partie 
it is not sene. Whan it is eclypse of the sonne 
it is not generall throughe all the clymates, 
but onely in some, but whan it is Eclypse of 
the moone, it is generall ouer all. 
 
[}Of .ii. great cyrcles, that is to say one meridien, 
and the other Ozyron that entersequeth 
one the other, and crosseth 
dyrectly. Capitu. xx.}] 
 
MEridien is a great cyrcle ymagyned 
on the skye, whiche passeth 
by the poles of the worlde 
and by the poynte of the skye, 
ryght ouer our heedes/ whiche 
is called zenych, and whan the son~e is comen 
oute from Orient vnto that cyrcle it is myd 
day, and therfore it is called merydien, and y=e= 
halfe of the cyrcle is ouer the erth, & the other 
[^f.H1v^] 
vnder it that passeth by the poyncte of myd-nyght 
dyrectly opposyte to zenych, and whan 
the son~e toucheth that partie of the cyrcle it is 
mydnygth, and if a man go to warde oryent 
or occydent he hath newe merydyen, and ther 
fore it is soner mydday to them that be towarde 
oryent than to other, if a man stande styll 
his merydyen is one styll: or if he go towarde 
mydday or Septemtryon, but if he styre he 
hath other zenych, and these two cyrcles crosseth 
directly. Oziron is a great cyrcle that deuydeth 
the partye of the skye that we se from 
that we se nat, and Ptholomeus saith yf that 
a man were in a playne countre he shulde se 
Iustly halfe of the skye, the whiche is called 
the Emispery (that is to say) halfe espere and 
ozyron is ioynynge nyghe to the erthe, of the 
whiche ozyron the entre is the mydle, and is 
the place in whiche we ben, thus eche is al-wayes 
in the myddes of his Ozyron and zenyche 
is the pole, and, as a man transporteth 
hym from one place to another he is in the other 
places agaynst the skye, and hathe other 
zenyche and other ozyron all ozyron is ryght 
or oblyke. They haue right oziron that habiteth 
vnder the equynoccyall, and haue theyr 
zenyche in the equinoccyall, for theyr ozyron 
[^f.H2r^] 
intersequieth and deuydeth the equynoccyall 
euen by the two poles of the worlde, that in 
suche wyse that none of the poles of the worlde 
is reysed aboue theyr ozyron nor depryued 
vnder it but they that habyteth other where 
than vnder the equynoccyall haue theyr ozyron 
oblyke, for theyr ozyron foloweth and denydeth 
the equynoccyall syde waye and nat 
right, and there appereth to them of al tymes 
one of the Poles of the worlde reysed aboue 
theyr ozyron, and the other ben ouer hydde so 
that they se them nat, more or lesse after dyuers 
habytacions, and after that they ben of 
fernes from the eqyunoccyall, and the more 
that the pole is reysed the more is the Ozyron 
oblyke, and the other pole depryued, and 
it is to wete that there is as moche dystaunce 
from the oziron to the pole as it is from the zenyche 
to the equinocciall, and that zenych is 
the fourth partye of merydien or the myddes 
of the bowe dyurnall, of the whiche the two 
endes ben on the oziron. And also that of the 
pole vnto the equynoccyall is the fourth partye 
of all the roundnes of the skyes, and also 
of the merydyen cyrcle sythe that it passeth by 
the poses & crosseth the equinoccyall dyrectly. 
 
Example of the ozyron of Parys after the 
[^f.H2v^] 
opynyon of Ptholomeus & other Astronomyers 
ouer the whiche ozyron they saye that the 
pole is reysed .xlix. degres, wherfore they say 
also that from the zenych of Parys vnto the 
equynoccyall ben .xlix. degrees, & that from 
the ozyron vnto the zenych whiche is the .iiii. 
partye of the merydyen cyrcle ben .lxxxx. degrees, 
and from the pole vnto the solstyce of 
Somer ben .lvii. degrees, & from the solstyce 
vnto the equynoccyall ben .xxxiii. degrees, 
there ben from the pole vnto the equynoccyal 
lxxxx. degrees, & is the fourthe partye of the 
roundenes of the skye from the equynoccyall 
vnto the solstyce of wynter ben .xxxiii. degrees, 
and from the solstyce vnto the ozyron .xviii. 
Thus shall the equynoccyall ben reysed 
ouer the ozyron .xli. degrees and the solstyce 
of somer .lxiiii. degrees in the whiche solstyce 
is the sonne at the houre of none the lo~gest 
daie of somer. And than it entreth in to the sygne 
of Cancer, and is moste nerer our habytable 
p~tyes that may be. And whan the son~e 
is in the solstyce of wynter the shortest day of 
the yere at the houre of moon it entreth to the 
sygne of Capricorne And the sayd solstyce is 
nat reysed ouer the ozyron of Parys but .viii 
degrees. The whiche eleuacyons & rysynges 
[^f.H3r^] 
a man may fynde playnly, so that he knewe 
one onely, and in euery regyon in lyke wyse 
after the sytuacion. 
 
[}Also hereafter do folowe .ii. other great 
circles of the sky and .iiii. small. Ca. xxi.}] 
 
ON the skye ben two great Cyrcles, named 
coloures/ that deuydeth the skyes 
in foure egall partyes, & crosseth theyr 
selfe dyrectly/ and the one passeth by the poles 
of the worlde, and by the two solstyces, 
and the other by the poles also, & by the two 
equynoccyall. The firste small cyrcle is called 
the circle artyke by cause of the pole zodiake 
aboute the pole artyke, and his lykenes is 
to his opposyte, named the cyrle antertyke. 
The other two ben named tropykes, the one 
of somer and the other of wynter. The tropyke 
of somer is cause of the solstice of somer begynning 
of the sygne of Cancer, and the tropyke 
of the solstyce of wynter begynnyng of 
the sygne of Capricorne, and ben egally dystaunce 
one cyrcle from the other. Here ought 
to be noted that the distaunces of y=e= pole artyke 
to the cyrcle artyke, and the distau~ce of the 
tropyke of somer to the equynoccyall, & that 
[^f.H3v^] 
of the equinocciall to the tropyke of wynter, 
and from the Circle Antertike to the pole antertike 
ben iust egall ech of .xxiii. degres and 
a halfe or there about, than the dystau~ce from 
the equinocciall to the tropyke of somer, and 
from the cyrcle artyke to the pole make togyther 
.xlvii. degrees. The whiche take awaye 
of the quarter betwene the pole and the equynocciall, 
whereas ben .lxxxx. degrees. saue 
that there abydeth xliii. That ben the dystau~ce 
betwene the tropyke of wynter and the cyrcle 
antertyke, and these circles ben sayd lytell 
for they be not so great as the other ben. Neuertheles 
they ben deuyded eche by .iii. C. lx. 
Degrees, as the greatest.
