[^p.8^] 
[}Particular Places: 
OR, 
Poynts of Inquiry concerning 
Life and Death.}] 
 
[/1./] 
OF Nature durable, and 
lesse durable, in liveles 
bodies, and in Vegetables, 
no copious or Legall, but 
a summary briefe inquiry is 
made. 
 
[/2./] 
Of the Drinesse, Withering, 
and Consumption of livelesse 
bodies and Vegetables, of their 
manner and progresse in working, 
and also of hindring and 
staying of Drying, Withering, 
and Consumption, and the 
[^p.9^] 
preservation of the state of 
Bodies; and also of Mollifying, 
Softning, and Reviving, 
beginning to be affected with 
Drinesse, make diligent inquiry. 
 
[/3./] 
Yet no perfect exact inquiry 
is needfull concerning these 
poynts, included under their 
proper Title of Duration and 
Continuance, beeing not principall 
matters in this Inquiry: 
but such as doe onely affoord 
light to prolonging and restoring 
of Life, in living 
Creatures, subiect (as is aforesayd) 
to the same accidents 
but in a peculiar manner. Afterward 
the inquiry proceedes 
from livelesse Creatures, and 
Vegetables, unto living Creatures, 
and Man. 
 
[/4./] 
Of long-liv'd, and shortliv'd 
[^p.10^] 
living Creatures, with the due 
circumstances, causing their 
long lives, enquire. But the 
dureablenesse of Bodies being 
two-fold, one in Identity or being, 
the other in repayring 
of Vegetables and living Creatures, 
perfected by nourishment, 
therefore concerning 
nourishment and the wayes and 
progresse thereof, enquire in 
the Title of Digestion and nourishment, 
where they are particularly handled. 
 
The inquiry proceeds from 
living Creatures to Man, the 
principall subject, whereof a 
more exact and perfect inquiry 
is needfull. 
 
[/5./] 
Of the long Life of men, in 
respect of the Ages of the 
World, Countries, Climates, 
places of birth, and Dwelling, 
inquire. 
 
[^p.11^] 
[/6./] 
Of the length and shortnesse 
of Life in men, in regard of 
their stocke and Kindred, and 
in respect of severall Complexions, 
Constitutions, shapes 
and statures of the Body, measure, 
and space of Growth, 
and the making and proportion 
of the Limbes, inquire. 
 
[/7./] 
The long and short Life of 
Men is shewed by no Astrologicall 
inquiry, but by common 
and evident Observations 
drawne from Births in the seaventh, 
eight, ninth, and tenth 
Moneth, by night or day, and 
in what Moneth of the yeare. 
 
[/8./] 
How Mans Life is lengthned 
and shortned, by sustenance, 
Dyet, government of 
Life, exercise, and the like, and 
by Ayre, shewed in the aforesayd 
poynt of dwelling places. 
 
[^p.12^] 
[/9./] 
How Studdies, kind of Life, 
affections of the Soule, and divers 
accidents doe shorten and 
lengthen the life of Man. 
 
[/10./] 
Of Medicines prolonging 
life. 
 
[/11./] 
The signes of a long and 
short life, not denoting ensuing 
Death, (which belong to 
Physicall History) but being 
in health apparent, are observable 
by the Physiognomy, and 
such others. 
 
To the inartificiall inquiry 
of length and shortnesse of 
Life, is added an Artificiall 
inquiry, by ten practicall intentions, 
being of three sorts, 
and intending to stay Consumption, 
to Repaire and Renew 
Age. 
 
[/12./] 
Preservatiues against drinesse 
and Consumption, and to keep 
[^p.13^] 
the body from drying and 
consuming. 
 
[/13./] 
Of Nourishment and Digestion, 
being Repairers of the 
body, and how to improove 
and make them good. 
 
[/14./] 
How to repaire and renew 
age, and to soften and moisten 
hardnesse and drynesse. 
 
[/15./] 
And because the way of death 
without knowing the seate, 
house, and den of death is hard 
to be knowne, therefore these 
kinds of Death are declared, 
which want and necessity, 
whence consumption of Age 
proceeds, not violence doe 
procure. 
 
[/16./] 
Of the drawing neare of 
Death, and the necessary not 
violent causes thereof. 
 
[/17./] 
Lastly, the lively character 
of Age describing the 
[^p.14^] 
different state of the Body in 
youth and Age, by their necessary 
Effects and Defects. 
 
Of the different state of the 
[/18./] 
Body, and abillities in Youth, 
and in Age remayning undecayed. 
 
[^Extract 2, pp. 130-228^] 
 
[^p.130^] 
[}Medicines for long life.}] 
 
[/19./] 
MEdicines there are many 
for preserving Health, and 
and curing Diseases, but few 
[^p.131^] 
to prolong life: Therefore 
those notables Medicines called 
Cordials, shall be here propounded. 
For Cordials taken 
to fortifie and strengthen the 
Heart and Spirits against poyson 
and diseases, being with 
Iudgement used, may by all 
likelyhood be as powerfull to 
prolong life. These heere selected, 
and orderly set downe, 
are best. 
 
[/20./] 
Gold is exhibited, and used 
three wayes; in potable Gold, 
Gold quenched in Wine, or 
substantiall Gold, as Leafe- 
Gold, and powder Gold. Potable 
Gold was given first in 
dangerous desperate Diseases, 
for an excellent powerful Cordiall, 
receiving the virtuall 
effect from the spirit of Salt 
wherein it is dissolved; for 
[^p.132^] 
Gold would bee more soveraigne, 
could it bee without 
corrosive waters, or by Corrosives 
cleared of their venemous 
quality, dissolved. 
 
[/21./] 
Pearles are taken in loose 
powder, or dissolved in the 
sharpe juyce of greene Lemmons, 
or in spiced Comfits, 
and drinkes. The Pearle and 
the shell whereunto it cleaves, 
are of one nature, and in quality 
like the shells of River-Crabs. 
 
[/22./] 
Two Christalline precious 
Stones are chiefe Cordials, 
the Emerald, and Iacinth, given 
in the same manner as 
Pearles, but not usually dissolved; 
yet these glasse greene 
stones are of a sharp operation. 
 
The benefit and helpe received 
from these medicinall 
[^p.133^] 
Species, shall be hereafter declared. 
 
[/23./] 
Bezars Stone is of approoved 
vertue, recreating the 
spirits, and provoking gentle 
sweat. Unicornes Horne is 
of like esteeme with the Harts 
Horne, and the Bone of the 
Harts heart, Ivory, and the 
like. 
 
[/24./] 
Amber-Grise is very good 
to comfort and refresh the 
spirits. These Drugges following 
are of approved vertue.

[/25./] 
Prescriptions for Dyet being 
here onely delivered, hot 
waters and Chymicall Oyles, 
(by Chymists sayd to be under 
the Planet of Mars) having a 
destructive furious operation, 
and also hot biting Spices are 
to bee rejected, and waters 
must bee made more temperate, 
lively, and fragrant than 
Phlegmatick Distillations, or 
hot Extractions of the spirit of 
Wine. 
 
[/26./] 
Often letting blood having 
beene formerly much used, 
[^p.135^] 
and all Observations falling 
out fit and convenient, is good 
to prolong life, the old moysture 
of the body being thereby 
evacuated and emptied, and 
new introduced and bred. 
 
[/27./] 
Consumptious also and sicknesses 
procuring leanenesse, 
being well cured, doe lengthen 
life, the Body being thereby 
supply'd with new moysture 
after the consumption of the 
old. Therefore it is sayd, that 
to grow healthfull after such a 
Sicknesse, is to grow youthfull; 
therefore the procuring of sicknesse 
by Artificiall Dyets shall 
be hereafter declared. 
 
[}Intentions.}] 
 
INquiry having beene made 
concerning livelesse bodies, 
[^p.136^] 
Vegetables, living creatures, 
and Man; a new search by true 
and proper Intentions, resembling 
the paths of mortall 
life, shall be made, and more 
effectuall than all former contemplations 
of comforting naturall 
heate, and Radicall 
moysture, or of meates breeding 
good Blood; neither 
hot, nor Phlegmaticke, and of 
refreshing and recreating the 
spirits; or of Medicines of 
Gold, being of all mettals 
least subject to corruption; and 
of precious Stones recreating 
the spirits by their hidden 
qualities and cleerenesse; and 
of the Balsomes and Quintessences 
of living Creatures, 
which being contayn'd and received 
in Vessels, would 
give a proud hope of immortality. 
[^p.137^] 
And of the flesh of 
Serpents and Harts being powerfull 
to renew Life, the 
one changing his skinne, the 
other his Hornes; and the 
flesh of Eagles, because the 
Eagle changeth his Bill; and 
of one that by annointing himselle 
all over, (except the 
soules of his feete) lived 300 
yeeres, and never felt any other 
sicknesse, but onely a 
swelling of his feete: and of 
Artesius, who perceiving that 
his spirits grew old, attracted 
the spirit of a lusty young man, 
killing him for that purpose, 
and receiving it into his 
mouth with the young mans 
last Breath, living many 
yeeres by his Spirit; and of 
fortunate Houres according 
to Astronomie, wherein 
[^p.138^] 
medicines to prolong Life 
should bee gathered and compounded, 
and of the Planets 
influence powerfull to prolong 
life, and the life superstitious 
fables, and strange delusions, 
by which Reason being besieged, 
hath miserably yeelded 
up the Fort of beleefe. But to 
these materiall Intentions, touching 
the quicke of the matter, 
though not largely handled, 
much cannot be added, some 
few Admonitions onely concerning 
them are to be delivered. 
 
First, the Offices and Duties 
of Life being better than Life, 
the Prescriptions of our Intentions 
hinder not the Offices 
and Duties of Life, such being 
rejected, or lightly mentioned, 
and not insisted on. For 
[^p.139^] 
no serious Discourse of living 
in a Denne, or hole of a Rocke 
like Epimenides Cave, never 
befriended with any cheerefull 
Sun-beame, or Day-light, 
or of continuall Baths of prepared 
Liquors, nor of Searecloaths, 
keeping the body in a 
bagge, nor of thicke pargetting 
and painting used by Salvages, 
or of accurate dyets to prolong 
life, formerly kept by Herodicus, 
and in our Age more moderately 
by Cornarus Venetus, 
nor the like unprofitable idle 
projects are heere mentioned. 
But our Remedies and Precepts 
may be used without interrupting 
and hindering common 
duties and businesses. 
 
Secondly, it is a vaine conceit, 
to imagine that any Potion 
or Medicine can stay or renew 
[^p.140^] 
the course of Nature; 
which great Worke must bee 
brought about and effected by 
Application of divers Remedies, 
and being a new project, 
must bee wrought by unusuall 
meanes. Thirdly, some following 
Propositions are not 
grounded on approoved experiments, 
but on Reason, 
and our former Principles and 
suppositions are all cut and digged 
out of the Rock and Myne 
of Nature. And because mans 
body is in Scripture said to be 
the Soules upper garment, therfore 
no dangerous, but wholesome 
and profitable Remedies 
are here propounded. Besides, 
it is observable, that the same 
drugs are not good to preserve 
Health, and to lengthen life; 
for some being good to cheere 
[^p.141^] 
the spirits, and make them 
vigorously and strongly performe 
their duties, doe shorten 
life; others being powerfull to 
prolong life, unlesse prevention 
bee used, doe endanger 
health; therefore some Cautions 
and Advertisements shall 
bee inserted, leaving the 
choise of Remedies belonging 
to the severall Intentions, to 
the Readers discretion. For 
their agreeablenesse to different 
constitutions of bodies, to 
divers kinds of Life, and severall 
ages, and the Order observable 
in their Application, 
would bee too tedious to declare, 
and unfit to bee published. 
 
The 3. Intentions propounded 
in the Topicks, of staying 
consumption, perfecting reparation 
[^p.142^] 
and renewing Age, are 
enlarged into these ten Operations. 
 
[/28./] 
The first Operation is of reviving 
and renewing the Spirits. 
 
[/29./] 
The second Operation is of 
excluding or keeping out the 
Ayre. 
 
[/30./] 
The third of Blood, and 
heate breeding Blood. 
 
[/31./] 
The fourth of the juyce and 
moysture of the Body. 
 
[/32./] 
The fifth of the Bowels, and 
digestion of nourishment. 
 
[/33./] 
The sixth is of the outward 
parts attracting nourishment. 
 
[/34./] 
The seaventh is of making 
Dyet more nourishing. 
 
[/35./] 
The eight is of the last act of 
Assimilation, or converting into 
the substance of the body. 
 
The ninth is of making the 
[^p.143^] 
parts of the body tender, after 
they begin to wither, and waxe 
dry. 
 
[/36./] 
The tenth is of purging out 
old moysture, and filling the 
body with fresh new moysture. 
 
Of these Operations, the 
first foure belong to the first Intention, 
the second foure to the 
second Intention, and the two 
last to the third Intention. 
 
And because these Intentions 
may bee dayly practised, 
therefore under the name of an 
History, Experiments, Observations, 
Counsells, Remedies, 
Explications of Causes and 
Reasons are together blended 
and mingled. 
 
[^p.144^] 
[}The Operation on the Spirits, 
to make them continue youthfull, 
and to revive and 
renew them being 
decayed.}] 
 
[}The History.}] 
 
[/38./] 
THat the Spirits worke all 
effects in the Body, is most 
cleere and evident by divers 
Experiments. 
 
[/39./] 
And youthfull Spirits convey'd 
into an old Body, would 
like a great wheele turning about 
the lesser, make Nature 
move backward, and old folks 
become young. 
 
[/40./] 
In all Consumption by Fire, 
or age, the more moisture that 
[^p.145^] 
the spirit or heate doth devoure, 
the lesse durable is the 
substance. 
 
[/41./] 
The spirits working temperately, 
should not drinke or devoure, 
but sip the moysture of 
the body. 
 
[/42./] 
Flames are of two kinds, one 
suddaine and weake, working 
and vanquishing thinne substances, 
as the blazing flame of 
straw, and shavings of wood: 
the other strong, and constant, 
invading hard stubborne substances, 
as the flame of great 
wood. 
 
[/43./] 
Flames suddainly blazing, 
and weake, doe dry, consume, 
and parch the Body: 
but strong flames dissolve and 
melt the body, making it moist 
and soft. 
 
[/44./] 
Also some plasters and medicines 
[^p.146^] 
for swellings, drawing 
out thinne humours, doe harden 
the flesh; others by drawing 
strongly, doe soften. 
 
[/45./] 
And some Purgations doe 
sweepe and fetch away waterish 
thinne humours, others 
draw downe watery, stubborne, 
slymy matter. 
 
[/46./] 
Such spirits as are more powerfull 
to abate, and subject 
hard stubborne humours, than 
to avoyd thinne and prepared 
humours, will keepe the body 
lusty and strong. 
 
[/47./] 
The Spirits should bee composed, 
thicke in substance, hot 
and lively; not sharpe and burning; 
of sufficient quantity, not 
abounding, or swelling; and 
quiet in motion, not hoyting 
or leaping in an unequall unruly 
manner. 
 
[^p.147^] 
[/48./] 
Vapours worke powerfully 
on the Spirits, as those doe arising 
from sleepe, drunkennesse, 
melancholy, and merry 
passions, and from odours and 
sweet smells recreating the 
fainting spirits. 
 
[/49./] 
The Spirits are by foure 
sorts of meanes thickned: by 
flight, cooling, delight, and restraint; 
and first of the thickning 
by flight. 
 
[/50./] 
Bodies by generall driving 
and putting to flight, are forced 
into their Center, and so 
thickned. 
 
[/51./] 
The juyce of blacke Poppy, 
and all medicines procuring 
sleepe, doe thicken the spirits 
by flight. 
 
[/52./] 
Three Graines of Poppy-juyce 
will make the spirits 
curdle together, and quite 
[^p.148^] 
extinguish their working. 
 
[/53./] 
The spirits are not put to 
flight by the coldnesse of Poppy-juyce, 
and the like Drugs 
being hot; but the flight of 
the spirits doth make them 
hot and cooling. 
 
[/54./] 
The flight of the spirits from 
Poppy-juyce, is best discerned 
by the outward application, 
making the spirits withdraw 
and retire, and keepe 
within, untill the mortified 
part turne to a Gangrine. 
 
[/55./] 
In painefull incisions, or 
cutting for the Stone, or 
cutting off Limbes, juyce of 
Hemlocke is used to mitigate 
the paine, by putting the 
spirits to flight, and casting 
the Patient into a swoone. 
 
[/56./] 
The thickning of the spirits 
by Flight, and driving 
[^p.149^] 
inwards, is a good effect of 
Poppy-juyce, proceeding 
from a bad Cause, being the 
flight of the spirits. 
 
[/57./] 
Poppey was esteemed by 
the Graecians to bee a great 
preserver of Health, and 
prolonger of Life: the principall 
ingredient used by the 
Arabians called Gods hands, 
was Poppey-juyce, the bad 
qualities thereof being allay'd 
with other mixtures, as Treacle, 
Mithridate, and the 
like. 
 
[/58./] 
All Medicines thickning the 
Spirits, as Poppey doth especially, 
and staying and restrayning 
the Spirits unruly 
working and raging in pestilentiall 
Diseases, are good to 
prolong life. 
 
[/59./] 
A good quantity of Poppy-juyce 
[^p.150^] 
being found by experience 
to be comfortable, is taken 
by the Turkes to make 
them valiant; but to us, unlesse 
taken in a small quantity, and 
well allay'd, it is deadly poyson. 
 
[/60./] 
Poppy-juyce doth also 
strengthen the spirits, and excite 
to Venery. 
 
[/61./] 
The distilled water of wilde 
Poppy is good for Surfeits, 
Feavers, and divers Diseases, 
the spirits being therby thickned, 
and strengthened to resist 
any diseases. 
 
[/62./] 
The Turkes drinke the powder 
of an hearbe in a warme water, 
to increase their valour, 
and sharpnesse of wit; but a 
greater quantity thereof is of 
a stupefying power like Poppey. 
 
[^p.151^] 
[/63./] 
The East Indians refresh 
themselves before and after 
labour, by holding in their 
mouths, or eating a famous 
Roote called Betell, enabling 
also their acts of Generation; 
being also of a stupefying power, 
because it blacketh the 
teeth. 
 
[/64./] 
Tobacco, in this age growne so 
common, and yeelding such 
a secret delight and content, 
that being once taken, it can 
hardly be forsaken, doth lighten 
the body, and take off 
wearinesse; opening the pores, 
and voyding humours, but 
thickning the spirits; being a 
kind of Henbane, and doth 
like Poppy, buzzell and trouble 
the braine. 
 
[/65./] 
Some humours of the body, 
as those proceeding from melancholy, 
[^p.152^] 
are like Poppey-juyce, 
and doe cause long 
life. 
 
[/66./] 
Opium, or Poppy-juyce, the 
Leaves and seeds of both kinds 
of Poppey, also Henbane, 
Mandrake, Hemlocke, Tobacco, 
Nightshade, or Banewort, 
have all a drowsie stupefying 
power. 
 
[/67./] 
Treacle, Mithridate, Trifer, 
Paracelsus Gumme, Syrrop of 
Poppey, Pills of Hounds 
tongue, are compouded drugs 
of the same nature. 
 
[/68./] 
These Prescriptions prolong 
life by thickning the spirits by 
coolers. 
 
[/69./] 
In Youth keepe every yeere 
a coole dyet about May, the 
spirits in Summer being loose 
and thinne, and no cold humours 
bred: and take a Julip 
[^p.153^] 
of Poppey, and other hot ingredients, 
but not too strong, 
every morning between sleep, 
then keepe a spare diet for fourteene 
dayes afterward, forbearing 
Wine, and hot Spices. 
 
[/70./] 
Smoakes and steames being 
not too purgative to draw 
forth humours, but having a 
light operation on the spirits 
of the braine, doe coole the 
spirits as well as coolers: therfore 
a Suffumigation made of 
Tobacco, wood of Aloes, 
dry Rosemary-leaves, and a 
little Myrrh, being in the 
morning received into the 
Nostrills, is very wholesome. 
 
[/71./] 
But the Water of compound 
Opiate Drugs, the vapor 
rising in distilling, and the 
[^p.154^] 
heate settling downwards, is 
better to bee taken in youth, 
than the drugs: for the vertue 
of distilled water is in their vapour, 
being in other respects 
weake. 
 
Some Drugs, being like Poppy, 
[/72./] 
but not so strong, doe 
yeeld a drowsie cooling vapour, 
and wholesomer than 
Poppy, not shunn'd by the 
spirits, being thereby gathered 
together, and thickned. 
 
[/73./] 
The drugges like unto Poppy, 
and therewith used, are 
Saffron, and Saffron flowers, 
the Indian Leafe, Amber-Grise, 
Coriander-seed prepared; 
Amomum, Pseudamomum, 
Rhodian wood, water of 
Orange Blossomes, and an infusion 
of the flowers steeped 
in Oyle Olive, and a Nutmeg 
[^p.155^] 
dissolved in Rose-water. 
 
Vse Poppy sparingly at set 
[/74./] 
times, but these other Drugs 
being commonly taken, and 
in dayly dyet, are very soveraigne 
to prolong life. 
 
Pharmacopaeus in Calecut, by 
using Amber lived to one hundred 
and sixty yeeres of Age, 
and the Nobility of Barbary, 
by using the same drugge, are 
longer liv'd than the common 
people. And our long-liv'd 
Ancestors used Saffron verymuch 
in their Cakes and 
Broths. So much of thickning 
the spirits by Poppy, and other 
drugges. 
 
[/75./] 
The second way and meanes 
to thicken the spirits is by 
cold; for cold doth properly 
thicken, and by a safer operation 
and working than the malignant 
[^p.156^] 
qualities of Poppey, 
though not so powerfully; 
yet because coolers may be familiarly 
used in dayly dyet, 
they are better to prolong Life 
than drowsie Potions, or Drugs. 
 
[/76./] 
The spirits are cooled by 
breathing, by vapours, or by 
dyet; the first way being best, 
but difficult; the second good, 
and easie; the third weake and 
tedious. 
 
[/77./] 
The cleare pure Ayre which 
may be taken on the dry tops 
of mountaines, and in open 
shady fields, is good to thicken 
the spirits. 
 
[/78./] 
Also vapours doe coole and 
thicken, and Nitre hath in this 
kind a speciall operation, 
grounded on these Reasons. 
 
[/79./] 
Nitre is a kind of cold Spice, 
being so cold that it biteth 
[^p.157^] 
the tongue as hot Spices doe. 
 
[/80./] 
The spirits of all Drugges 
Naturally, not Accidentally 
cold, are few and weake; spirituall 
Drugges being on the 
contrary hot; Nitre onely having 
aboundance of spirits, is 
of a vegetable nature, and cold. 
For Camphire is spirituall, 
and cold in operation by accident, 
and the thinne quality 
thereof being without sharpnesse, 
doth lengthen the breath 
in inflammations. 
 
[/81./] 
Also Nitre mingled with 
Snow and Ice, and put about 
vessels, doth congeale and 
freeze the liquor within, and 
common Bay-salt doth make 
Snow colder, and more apt 
to freeze. But in hot Countries 
where no Snow falls, Niter 
is onely used. 
 
[^p.158^] 
[/82./] 
Sea-men and Souldiers, to 
make them valiant, doe drinke 
Gunne-powder before they 
fight, or joyne Battaile, as the 
Turkes doe Poppy. 
 
[/83./] 
Nitre doth allay the destroying 
heate of burning Agues, 
and pestentiall Feavers. 
 
[/84./] 
The Nitre in Gun-powder 
shunning the flame when a 
Peece is fired, doth make the 
cracke and report. 
 
[/85./] 
Nitre is the spirit of the 
earth; for any pure earth covered 
or shaded from the Sunbeames, 
so that nothing doe 
spring or grow thence, will 
gather store of Nitre, the spirit 
of Nitre being inferiour to 
the spirit of living creatures, 
and of Vegetables, and Plants. 
 
[/86./] 
Cattell drinking of water 
wherein there is Nitre, doe 
[^p.159^] 
grow fat, being a signe that 
the Nitre is cold. 
 
[/87./] 
Land and Grounds are made 
ranke and mellow by the fatning 
quality of the spirit of 
Nitre, which is in dung. 
 
[/88./] 
Therefore the spirit of Nitre 
will coole, thicken, and refresh 
the spirits, and abate their 
heate. For as strong Wine and 
Spices doe enflame the spirits, 
and shorten life, so Nitre composing 
and restrayning the spirits, 
doth lengthen life. 
 
[/89./] 
Nitre may bee used with 
meate, and eaten with Salt to 
the proportion of a tenth part, 
and put in morning Broaths, 
from three Graines to ten; or 
in drinke, and being used in any 
manner moderately, it prolongs 
Life. 
 
[/90./] 
As other Drugges besides 
[^p.160^] 
Poppy, being weaker, and safer, 
to bee taken in greater 
quantity, and oftner, doe condensate 
and thicken the spirits 
by flight: so Drugs of an inferiour 
nature and operation to 
Nitre, doe also coole and thicken 
the spirits. 
 
All Drugges inferiour to Niter 
[/91./] 
smell earthly, like good 
pure earth newly turn'd up, 
and digg'd: the chiefe whereof 
are Burrage, Buglosse, 
Burnet, Strawberry-leaves, 
and Strawberries, Cowcumbers, 
and fragrant Apples, 
Vine-leaves, and Buds, and 
Violets. 
 
[/92./] 
Next to these are Drugges 
of a hot smell, but cooling; as 
Balme, Citrons, and Lemmons, 
greene Oranges, Rose-water, 
roasted Peares, Damask 
[^p.161^] 
and Red Roses, and Muske-Roses. 
 
[/93./] 
These Fruits, inferiour to 
Nitre for thickning the spirits, 
should bee used raw, not roasted, 
their cooling spirits being 
by fire dispersed; therefore 
to infuse or squeeze them 
into Drink, or to eate, or smell 
to them raw is best. 
 
[/94./] 
The spirits are thickned also 
by the odour and smell of other 
Drugges inferiour to Poppey 
and Nitre. For the smell 
of pure fresh earth, comming 
from following a Plough, or 
digging, or weeding, and the 
smel of leaves fallen from trees 
in Woods, or Hedge-rowes at 
the beginning of Autumne, is 
good to coole the spirits: and 
especially wither'd Strawberry 
leaves; also the smel of Violets, 
[^p.162^] 
of the flowers of Pellitory of 
the Wall, of Blackberries, 
and Madre-selve, is cooling. 
 
[/95./] 
A Noble man of my acquaintance, 
who lived to bee 
very old, did usually after 
sleepe, smell to a clod of fresh 
earth. 
 
[/96./] 
Also Endive, Succory, Liverwort, 
Purslaine, &c. doe 
by cooling the blood, coole 
also the spirits, though not so 
soone as vapours and smells. 
So much of thickning the spirits 
by Flight. The third kind 
of thickning is by Delight: 
the fourth by the restraint of 
their cheerefulnesse, joyfulnesse, 
and too violent motions. 
 
[/97./] 
The spirits are mitigated 
and thickned by such acceptable 
pleasing Objects, as 
doe not draw them forth, but 
[^p.163^] 
afford them inward delight, 
whereby being collected into 
their Center, they enjoy 
themselves, and therein finde 
a sweete content. 
 
[/98./] 
The former Positions of 
drugges inferior to Opium and 
Nitre, being here remembred, 
further inquiry of thickning 
the spirits by cooling will bee 
needelesse. 
 
[/99./] 
The restraint of the violent 
affections and motions of the 
spirits, shall bee hereafter declared: 
now the thickning of 
the spirits having beene shewed, 
the qualification and temper 
of their heate follows. 
 
[/100./] 
The spirits should not bee 
hot, and sharpe, but strong, 
and lusty, to conquer and subdue 
resisting matter; not to attenuate 
& expell thin humors. 
[^p.164^] 
Spices, Wine, and strong 
drinke must be temperately used, 
and after Abstinence hath 
refreshed the appetite: and also 
Savory, Margerum, Pennyroyall, 
and all heaters that bite 
on the tongue, must bee seldome 
used: The heate by 
them infused into the Spirits 
being not operative, but 
a devouring heate. 
 
[/101./] 
These Hearbs strengthen 
the heate of the Spirits; Endive, 
Garlicke, Blessed-Thistle, 
young Cresses, Germander, 
Angelico, Wormseed, 
Vervin, Set-well, 
Myrrhe, Pepperwort, Elder-budds, 
and Parsley, and 
being used in Sawces and Medicines, 
are hot in operation. 
 
[/102./] 
Also of cooling Drugges, 
[^p.165^] 
compounded with Euphorbium, 
Bastard Pellitory, Stavesacres, 
Dragon-wort, Anacardium, 
Oyle of Beavers-stone, 
Hart-wort, Opoponax, 
Gumme of Agasillis, 
and Galbanum, and the like, 
to allay the drowsie stupefying 
power of Poppey, a 
very good Medicine to strengthen 
the spirits, and make 
them hot and lusty may bee 
made, like Treacle and Mithridate 
being not sharpe, nor 
biting on the tongue, but bitter, 
and of a strong sent, yet 
hot in the stomacke, and in 
working, or in their Operations. 
 
[/103./] 
The desire of Venery often 
stirred up and excited, but 
seldome satisfied in Act, 
doth strengthen the heate of 
[^p.166^] 
the spirits, and so doe some 
of the affections. So much of 
the heate of the spirits, being a 
cause of long life. 
 
[/104./] 
The spirits should not abound, 
but be few, and moderate; 
for a small flame devoures 
not so much as a greater. 
 
[/105./] 
A sparing Pythagoricall dyet, 
such as Monks and Hermits 
under the Order of St. Necessity, 
and St. Poverty used, is 
good to prolong life. 
 
[/106./] 
Also drinking of water, hard 
lodging, cold spare Dyet of 
Sallets, Fruits, and powderd 
flesh, and salt Fish, without any 
fresh warme meate, a haire- 
shirt, fasting, watching, abstinence 
from sensuall pleasures, 
doe abate and diminish the spirits, 
which being reduc'd to a 
[^p.167^] 
quantity sufficient to maintaine 
life, doe make lesser wast 
on the body. 
 
[/107./] 
But a higher Dyet, somewhat 
above those rigorous 
moderate Dyets, being kept 
in an equall constant manner, 
hath the same operation. For 
a great constant, quiet flame 
consumes not so much as a lesser 
which blazeth, and is somtimes 
bigger, sometimes lesser: 
and Cornarus Venetus keeping 
such a constant Dyet, and 
drinking and eating so many 
yeeres, by just proportion and 
weight, lived in perfect health 
untill hee was an hundred 
yeeres of age. 
 
[/108./] 
Also to avoyd inflammation 
of the spirits, a full-fed body 
not mortified by strict dyets, 
must use seasonable Venery, 
[^p.168^] 
lest the spirits swelling 
too much doe soften and destroy 
the body: so much of the 
moderate plenty of spirits. 
 
[/109./] 
The restraynt of the spirits 
motion is next considerable, 
for motion doth make the spirits 
hot. There be three Restrayners 
of the spirits, Sleepe, 
avoyding of violent labour, exercise, 
and wearinesse, and the 
governing and moderating of 
troublesome affections. And 
first of Sleepe. 
 
[/110./] 
Epimenides slept many 
yeeres in a Cave without any 
food, because the spirits in 
sleepe devoure not much radicall 
moysture. 
 
[/111./] 
Also Dormice and Bats doe 
sleepe in holes all the Winter, 
sleepe restrayning the consuming 
power of their vitall spirits, 
[^p.169^] 
so Bees wanting Honey, 
and Butter-flies and Flesh-flyes 
do live by sleep. 
 
Sleepe after Dinner, the 
[/112./] 
first Vapours of meate like a 
Dew ascending then into the 
head, is good for the Spirits, 
but unwholesome for the body. 
And sleepe is as nourishing 
as meate for old folkes, 
who should often take light 
Refections, and short naps, and 
beeing growne extreame olde 
should live in continuall ease 
and Rest, especially in Winter. 
 
[/113./] 
Thus moderate sleepe being 
sound and quiet, doth prolong 
Life. 
 
[/114./] 
To make one sleepe soundly 
and quietly, Violets are 
good, sod Lettuce, Syrrup of 
Roses, Saffron, Balme, Apples 
[^p.170^] 
eaten before going to Bed, a 
sop dipt in Malmsey, wherein 
a Muske-Rose hath beene 
steeped, or a Pill or Potion 
made of these Ingredients. 
Also all binding Drugges, as 
Coriander-seed prepared, and 
roasted Quinces, and Peares, 
doe cause sound and quiet 
sleepe: But a good draught of 
cleere cold Water is best to 
make young folkes having strong 
stomacks, sleepe soundly. 
 
Voluntary Extasies, and fixed 
profound Meditations, 
joyned with a quiet minde, 
doe thicken the spirits more 
than sleepe, making them rest 
from outward operations, as 
sleepe doth. So much of sleep. 
 
[/115./] 
Violent wearisome exercises 
and motions, as Running, 
Tennis, Fencing, are not 
[^p.171^] 
good, nor strayning of strength 
to the uttermost, as Leaping, 
and wrestling: for the spirits 
by such violent nimble motions, 
and straining of the 
strength being droven into a 
narrow roome, doe become 
more sharpe, and praedatory, 
or devouring: but Dancing, 
Shooting, Riding, Bowling, and 
such moderate Exercises are 
very healthfull. 
 
Some of the affections and 
passions of the minde doe shorten 
the life of man, and some 
doe cause long life. 
 
[/116./] 
By exceeding great joy the 
spirits are made thinne, loose, 
and weake, but by familiar 
common Recreations they 
are not loosened, but strengthened. 
 
[/117./] 
Joy arising from sensuall 
[^p.172^] 
pleasure is bad, but the remembrance 
of former ioy, or the 
apprehension of ioy to come 
conceived onely in the imagination 
is good. 
 
[/118./] 
An inward conceived ioy, 
sparingly vented, doth comfort 
the heart more than a vulgar 
immoderate expression of 
ioy. 
 
[/119./] 
Sorrow and Griefe, beeing 
without Feare, and not too 
heavy, and Grievous, doe 
prolong Life by Contracting 
the Spirits, which is a kinde 
of Condensation or Thickning. 
 
[/120./] 
Great Feares doe shorten 
Life; for though Sorrow and 
Feare doe both contract the 
Spirits, yet Sorrow doeth 
onely contract, but Feare 
mingled with Care and Hope, 
[^p.173^] 
doth heate and Vexe the Spirits. 
 
[/121./] 
Anger being close and suppressed 
is a kinde of vexation, 
making the spirits devoure the 
moisture of the body, but being 
vented and getting forth, doth 
strengthen the heate of the 
spirits. 
 
[/122./] 
By Envy the worst passion, 
the Spirits, and by them the 
Body are hurt and weakned, 
beeing alwayes in Action 
and Working, for Envy is 
sayde to keepe no Holydayes. 
 
[/123./] 
Pitty and Compassion of 
anothers misery, whereinto 
wee cannot possibly fall, is 
good, but Pitty reflecting 
backe, and exciting Feare of 
beeing in as bad a case, is 
bad. 
 
[^p.174^] 
[/124./] 
Shame lightly at the first 
drawing in the spirits, and afterwards 
sending them forth 
againe, doth make blushing 
bashfull Folkes commonly 
long-liv'd. But shame arising 
from Reproach, and continuing 
long, doth contract and 
choake the spirits. 
 
[/125./] 
Love not unfortunate, nor 
wounding too deepe, being a 
kind of joy, is governed by the 
rules prescribed for joy. 
 
[/126./] 
Hope being the best of all 
the Affections, and Passions, 
is very powerfull to prolong 
Life, if like a nodding Nurse 
it doe not often fall asleepe, 
and languish, but doe continually 
feed the fancy with beholding 
good Obiects. And 
therefore such as propound 
certaine ends and purposes to 
[^p.175^] 
be compassed, thriving and 
prospering therein according 
to their desire, are commonly 
long-liv'd: but having attayned 
to their highest hopes, 
all their Expectations and desires 
being satisfied, doe not 
live long afterward. 
 
[/127./] 
Admiration and light contemplation 
are very good to 
prolong Life, keeping the spirits 
busied in delightfull matters, 
and in a peaceable quiet 
gentle temper: So that all 
Philosophers, and observers 
of the Wonders of Nature, (as 
Democritus, Plato, Parmenides, 
Apollonius) were longliv'd. Also 
Rhetoricians, tasting onely 
matters, & following the light 
of speech, not obscure dark Philosophy, 
were also long-liv'd, as 
Gorgias, Protagoras, Isocrates, 
[^p.176^] 
Seneca. And as old men are Talkative, 
so Talkative men, doe 
often live to bee old men. For 
Talkativenesse is a signe of a 
light Apprehension, not binding 
or vexing the spirits: but 
subtile acute studies wearying 
and weakening the spirits, doe 
shorten life. So much of the 
motion of the spirits by the 
passions of the minde, some 
generall Observations not included 
in the former Division, 
doe follow. 
 
[/128./] 
The spirits must not bee often 
loosed, nor made thinne, 
being thereby loosed; for 
the spirits being once extenuated, 
loosened, and made 
thinne, are not easily collected 
and thickned. The spirits 
are loosed by excessive Labour, 
exceeding violent passions 
[^p.177^] 
of the minde, much 
sweating, much Evacuation, 
warme Baths, and intemperate 
or unseasonable Venery; 
also Care, Griefe, doubtfull 
expectation, sicknesse, 
sorrow, and payne, doe dissolve 
and loosen the spirits, 
and should therefore bee avoyded 
and shunned. 
 
[/129./] 
The spirits delight in Customes 
and Novelties; for customes 
not used untill they 
grow wearisome, and Novelties 
much desired, and then 
enjoy'd, doe wonderfully 
preserve the vigour of the 
spirits. Therefore Judgment 
and Care should bee shewed 
in leaving off Customes before 
they become loathsome 
and contemptible, and in 
making the desire of Novelties 
[^p.178^] 
stronger by restraint, and in 
altering and changing the 
course of our life, lest the 
spirits imploy'd in one setled 
kind of Life should grow heavy 
and dull: For though Seneca 
sayd well, A foole 
doth alwayes beginne to live; 
yet this Folly and many other 
doe lengthen life. 
 
[/130./] 
It is observable (contrary 
to common custome) that the 
spirits being in a good, quiet, 
sound temper, (discerned 
by the quietnesse and inward 
joy of the minde) should 
bee cherrished, not changed. 
 
[/131./] 
Ficinus saith, that Old men 
should comfort their spirits 
with the actions of their childhood, 
and youth, being a Recreation 
proper to Age. Therefore 
[^p.179^] 
the remembrance of former 
Education together is 
pleasant in conversation, and 
the place of Education is beheld 
with delight. So that the 
Emperour Vespasian would not 
alter his Fathers house, being 
but a meane building, because 
the old House did put him in 
remembrance of his Childhood: 
and besides, on festivall 
Dayes hee would drinke in a 
Silver-tip'd wooden Cup, 
Which was his Grand-mothers. 
 
[/132./] 
Also an alteration of life for 
the better, is acceptable and 
delightfull to the Spirits. 
Therefore Youth and Manhood 
having beene spent in 
pleasures proper and peculiar 
to those Ages, Old age 
should enjoy new delights, 
[^p.180^] 
especially moderate ease. 
Therefore Noble-men in 
their Age should live a retired 
kind of life, as Cassiodorus, 
having beene in great favour 
with the Gothish Kings of Italy, 
and accounted the soule 
and life of their Affaires, at 
fourescore yeeres of age retired 
to a Monastery, living 
there to 110. yeeres of Age, 
and there dyed. But such Retyrement 
should be before the 
body bee decayed, and diseased, 
for then all changes, 
though for the better, doe hasten 
death: and a retyred life 
being undertaken, their minds 
and thoughts should not be addicted 
to idlenesse, but imploy'd 
in pleasant delightfull 
studies, or in building and 
planting, 
 
[^p.181^] 
[/133./] 
Lastly, the spirits are recreated 
by labour willingly undertaken, 
but consumed by 
action or labour performed 
with unwillingnesse. Therefore 
a free kind of life by Art 
contrived, to bee at our owne 
disposing, and an obedient 
minde, not resisting, but yeelding 
to the power of fortune, 
doe prolong life. 
 
[/134./] 
And for the better governing 
of the Affections, the body 
must not bee soluble, or 
loose; for on all the affections, 
except those arising from melancholy, 
as Drunkennesse 
and Melancholy, such laxativenesse 
and loosenesse hath 
more power than on the heart 
or braine. 
 
[/135./] 
This operation of making 
the spirits continue youthfull 
[^p.182^] 
and lusty, not mentioned by 
Physitians, hath beene more 
diligently handled, because 
the readiest and most compendious 
way to prolong Life, is 
by renewing the Spirits, working 
suddainly on the body, 
as vapours and passions doe 
worke on the spirits in a direct 
not indirect manner. 
 
[}The Operation on the exclusion, 
or keeping out of the 
Ayre. 2. 
 
The History.}] 
 
[/136./] 
THe Exclusion or keeping 
out of the Ayre, doth in 
two respects lengthen life: 
[^p.183^] 
First, because the outward 
Ayre animating the spirits, and 
being healthfull, doth next 
unto the inward spirits, devoure 
the moysture of the body, 
growing thereby dry, 
and withered. 
 
[/137./] 
Secondly, by the Exclusion 
and keeping out of Ayre, the 
body being shut and closed, 
and not breathing forth at the 
pores, the detayned spirits 
by their working doe soften 
the hardnesse of the body. 
 
[/138./] 
The reason hereof is grounded 
on the infallible Axiom of 
the drynesse, the body being 
dryed by the emission and issuing 
forth of the spirits, but by 
their detayning melted and 
softned. Besides, it is a Position 
that all kind of heate doth properly 
[^p.184^] 
make thin and moysten, 
and doth onely accidentally 
contract and dry. 
 
[/139./] 
Dwelling in Caves and 
Dennes, the Ayre receiving 
there no Sun-beames, doth 
lengthen life; for the ayre being 
not excited by heate, cannot 
wast and consume the body. 
And by divers ancient 
Tombes and Monuments in 
Sicily, and other places, it is 
cleerely evident, that the stature 
of man was greater in former 
Ages than now, being of a 
great stature, and long-liv'd. 
Epimenides Cave is an ancient 
Fable. And as living in Caves 
was then usuall, so the Anchorites 
lived in Pillars, impenetrable 
by the Sun-beames, and 
the Ayre being unchangeable. 
The Anchorites, Simeon, Stilita, 
[^p.185^] 
Daniel, and Saba living in Pillars, 
were very long-liv'd. Also 
moderne Anchorites have 
lived in walls and Pillars unto 
a great Age. 
 
[/140./] 
Dwelling on Mountaines is 
next to living in Caves; for 
the Sun-beames pierce not, 
nor penetrate into Caves, and 
on the tops of Mountaines 
have no reflexion, and little 
strength. But on Mountaines 
having a cleare pure ayre, and 
drye Vallies below, whence 
no Clouds or Vapours doe 
ascend, being like those 
mountaines encompassing Barbary, 
whereon people live to 
an hundred yeeres of Age, it is 
good dwelling. 
 
[/141./] 
Such an Ayre, either in 
Caves, or on Mountaines, is 
not naturally praedatory, or devouring; 
[^p.186^] 
but our common 
Ayre being of a wasting quality 
through the warme heate 
of the Sunne, must be excluded, 
and kept out of the body. 
 
[/142./] 
The Ayre is excluded, or 
kept out by shutting or filling 
the pores. 
 
[/143./] 
Coldnesse of the Ayre, nakednesse 
of the skinne, washing 
in cold water, binders applyed 
to the skinne, as Masticke, 
Myrrhe, and Myrtle, doe shut 
& close the pores of the body. 
 
[/144./] 
Baths also made of astringent 
binding minerall waters, 
extracted from steele and 
glasse, doe strongly contract 
and close the skinne, but must 
be seldome used, especially in 
Summer. 
 
[/145./] 
Concerning filling; painting, 
[^p.187^] 
oyntments, oyles, and Pomanders 
doe preserve the substance 
of the body, as oyle-colours 
and Varnish doe preserve 
wood. 
 
[/146./] 
The ancient Brittaines painted 
their bodies with Woad, 
and were very long-liv'd; and 
so were the Picts, from the 
like painting of their bodies 
called Picts, or living Pictures. 
 
[/147./] 
The Virginians and Brasilians 
doe paint themselves, and 
are very long-liv'd; for the 
French Fryars lately found 
there some Indians who could 
remember an hundred and 
twenty yeeres since the building 
of Farnamburg. 
 
[/148./] 
Iohn of Times living to 300. 
yeeres of Age, being asked 
what Preservatives had 
[^p.188^] 
made him live so long? answered, 
Oyle without, Honey 
within. 
 
[/149./] 
The wild Irish also live very 
long, being used to annoynt 
themselves naked before the 
fire with old salt-peeter: And 
the Countesse of Desmond 
bred teeth thrice, and lived to 
140. yeeres of Age. 
 
[/150./] 
The Irish doe weare saffroned 
Linnen, and shirts, continuing 
long cleane, and lengthening 
life. For Saffron being 
a great binder, oyly, and hot 
without sharpnesse, is very 
comfortable to the skinne and 
flesh. I remember that an English 
man, being to goe to Sea, 
and having put a bag of Saffron 
within his Doublet, next 
his Breast, to avoyd paying of 
Custome, was in that Voyage 
[^p.189^] 
very healthfull, having been 
formerly alwayes sea-sicke. 
 
[/151./] 
Pure fine Linnen (according 
to Hypocrates advice) should 
be worne in Winter next unto 
the skinne: in Summer courser 
Linnen, and oyled; for the 
spirits being then very much 
exhaled and drawne forth, the 
pores of the skinne should bee 
closed and filled. 
 
[/152./] 
Annointing of the skin at the 
first rising out of Bed with 
Oyle-olive, or Oyle of Almonds 
mingled with Bay-salt, 
and Saffron, is good to lengthen 
life. But this annoynting 
must be with Wooll, or a 
soft spunge lightly done; not 
dropping on the body, but 
onely wetting the skinne. 
 
[/153./] 
For the body being drawne 
by a great quantity, and drinking 
[^p.190^] 
in a lesser quantity, should 
bee therefore lightly annoynted, 
or instead thereof oyled 
shirts may be worne. 
 
[/154./] 
But the Grecians and Romans 
formerly using this annointing 
with Oyle, left off now in Italy, 
lived not longer in those 
Ages, being used by all, except 
Fencers, onely after Bathing, 
hot Baths being of a 
contrary operation opening 
the pores by unctions and 
oyntments shut together and 
closed. Therefore Bathing 
without Annoynting is unhealthfull, 
but Annoynting 
without Bathing is very good. 
Besides, precious Oyntments 
were then used for delicacy 
and delight, not for health, or 
to lengthen life, as Virgil 
sayd: 
[^p.191^] 
Nec Cassia liquidi corrumpitur 
usus Olivi: 
Nor doth the use of Oyle decay, 
By using precious Cassia. 
 
[/155./] 
Annoynting is healthfull to 
keepe out cold in Winter, and 
good to keepe in the spirits in 
the Summer from loosening, 
and defend them from the 
praedatory devouring power 
of the ayre. 
 
[/156./] 
In annoynting with good 
Oyle, being good to prolong 
Life, foure Cautions arising 
from foure discommodities 
are observable. 
 
[/157./] 
The first discommodity is, 
that suppressing of sweat may 
breed diseases out of those excrementitious 
Humours, being 
not prevented by Purgations 
and Glisters. For 
[^p.192^] 
sweating, though healthfull, 
doth weaken nature, and shorten 
life; but moderate Purgatives 
work on the humours, not 
the spirits, as sweat doth. 
 
[/158./] 
The second discommodity 
is, that by heating and enflaming 
the body, the enclosed 
spirits venting not forth by 
breathing, may become hot. 
This inconvenience is prevented 
by a coole dyet, and by often 
taking such coolers, as in 
the operation of blood shal be 
mentioned. 
 
[/159./] 
Thirdly, annoynting may 
make the Head heavy; for all 
outward filling, striking back 
the vapours, doth drive them 
backe towards the Head: but 
Purgatives and Glisters, and 
closing the mouth of the Ventricle 
with restrictive binders, 
[^p.193^] 
and combing and rubbing the 
head with Lye, to cause the 
exhalations, and using exercises 
to vent humours by the 
pores of the skin, doe all prevent 
this inconvenience. 
 
[/160./] 
The fourth discommodity 
being of a subtiler nature, is 
the increasing of the detayned 
spirits by shutting the pores; 
for new spirits being without 
any venting of the old continually 
generated and multiplyed, 
would feed on, and 
waste the body; but this assertion 
is erronious, for the spirits 
being confined, are dull, 
(and venting by motion as 
Flame) are not so active and 
generative to increase in heate 
like a hot flame, but slow in 
motion: besides, this inconvenience 
may be remedied by 
[^p.194^] 
coolers, steeped in oyle of Roses 
and Myrtle, but Cassia, 
and heaters must bee shunned. 
 
[/161./] 
The linings of apparell for 
exhausting and drawing the 
Body, should not be of a watery 
but oyly substance; and 
therefore Bayes and woollen 
linings are better than Linnen. 
And sweete powders 
sooner loose their sent among 
Linnen, than among Woollen; 
Linnen beeing soft and 
cleane, but not so healthfull 
as Woollen. 
 
[/162./] 
The wild Irish beginning to 
grow sicke, doe presently take 
the sheets of their Beds, and 
afterwards wrappe themselves 
in the woollen Blankets. 
 
[/163./] 
Carded Wooll worne next 
the skin in Britches and Doublets 
[^p.195^] 
is very good. 
 
[/164./] 
Accustomed Ayre wasts 
not the Body so much as 
change of Ayre: Therefore 
poore men living in Cottages, 
and never changing their 
Dwellings, are commonly 
long-liv'd. But in other Respects, 
the Spirits beeing fresh 
and lively change of Ayre is 
good, foure yeerely remoovings 
beeing sufficient, that 
so neither Travayle, nor continuall 
residence in one place 
may proove wearisome. So 
much of excluding or keeping 
out, and avoyding the praedatory 
devouring power of the 
Ayre. 
 
[^p.196^] 
[}The Operation on the Blood, and 
cooling the heate of the 
Blood. 3.}] 
 
[}The History.}] 
 
THe two Operations following 
have (as Actives 
to Passives) Relation to the 
former, which endeavoured 
to keepe the spirits and ayre 
from wasting the body, as 
these shew how to make the 
blood, moysture, and body 
lesse subject to depraedation 
and wasting: but Blood watering 
the moysture and 
limbes, three powerfull rules 
concerning the operation on 
[^p.197^] 
the Blood shall bee first propounded. 
 
[/165./] 
First, Blood being cold is 
lesse dissipable, and subject 
to scattering abroad. There 
are two coolers more agreeable 
to the following Intentions 
than Julips or Potions. 
 
[/166./] 
In Youth Glisters not purgative 
or cleansing, but onely 
refrigerative, cooling, and opening, 
made of the juyce of Lettuce, 
Purslane, Liverwort, 
Sevegreene, or House-leeke, 
Fleawort-seed, with a temperate 
opening decoction, mingled 
with a little Camphire: 
but in Age, instead of House-leeke 
and Purslane, the juyce 
of Borage and Endive may be 
used, and these Glisters must 
be an Houre or more retained. 
 
[/167./] 
Secondly, in Summer a Bath 
[^p.198^] 
may be made of sweete lukewarme 
water, and new whey, 
and Roses, insteade of Mallows, 
Mercury, Milke, and 
such like mollifiers and softners. 
 
Annoynt the Body with 
[/168./] 
Oyle and thickning substances 
before Bathing, for receiving 
the refrigerating quality of the 
coolers, and repelling the water, 
the pores of the body being 
not shut too close, left outward 
cold strongly closing & 
shutting the Body, doe hinder 
cooling, and rather stirre 
up heate. 
 
Bladders also apply'd with 
[/169./] 
Decoctions and cooling juyces 
to the inferiour Region 
of the Body, beneath the 
Ribs downward, are a kind 
of Bathing, whereby the liquour 
[^p.199^] 
being excluded, the 
Refrigerating quality, or 
Coolenesse is onely received. 
 
The third Rule doth onely 
[/170./] 
qualifie the substance of 
the Blood, making it firmer 
and lesse subject to Dissipation, 
and scattering abroad, 
or to the working heate of the 
spirits. 
 
[/171./] 
To effect this Operation, 
powder of Gold, or Leafe-Gold, 
or powder of Pearle, 
precious Stones and Corrals, 
are good; being therefore 
much esteemed by the Arabians, 
Grecians, and also 
Modernes. Therefore to omit 
fantasticall Opinions, insinuation 
being made into the 
substance of the Blood, the spirits 
and heate having no power 
[^p.200^] 
to worke thereon, putrefaction 
and drying would bee 
thereby prevented, and Life 
prolonged; yet divers Cautions 
are observable: First let 
them bee exactly pulveriz'd, 
and made into powder; secondly, 
let their malignant 
quality, hurtfull to the veines, 
be taken away: thirdly, beware 
lest their long abode in 
the body, being taken with 
meate, or otherwise received, 
doe breed dangerous obstructions 
in the Bowels: fourthly, 
to avoyd Repletion, or filling 
of the veines, let them be 
seldome used. 
 
[/172./] 
Therefore take them fasting, 
in White-wine mingled with a 
little oyle of Almonds, and 
afterward use some exercise. 
 
[/173./] 
In this operation use Pearles, 
[^p.201^] 
Corrall, and Gold; for all other 
Mettals, having some malignant 
quality, are not so exactly 
pulveriz'd, or made into 
powder, and the powder of 
cleere grasse greene stones is 
bad, being a Corrosive. 
 
[/174./] 
But drugges of wood may 
be more safely and effectually 
used in Infusions and Decoctions, 
being good to make the 
Blood firme, and not dangerous 
for breeding of Obstructions; 
and their Infusions being taken 
in Dyet, or Drinke, having no 
dregs, doe easily pierce into 
the veines. 
 
[/175./] 
Drugges of Wood are Sanders, 
the Oke, and Vine; but 
hot woods having in them any 
Rozzen, or Gumme, are not 
good: but dry Rosemary- 
stalkes, being a shrub as long- 
[^p.202^] 
liv'd as many Trees, and such 
a quantity of Ivy-stalkes as 
will not make the Potion unsavory 
may be used. 
 
[/176./] 
Drugs of wood may be also boiled 
in Broths, infused into Ale, 
or Wine before they be setled 
or refined: But Guiacum, and 
such Drugges must bee put in 
before the Broaths are boyled, 
that the substance of 
the firmer parts of the Wood 
being dissolved, may remaine 
in the Broath: but whether 
Ash bee good in Potions is 
uncertaine. So much of the 
Operation on the Blood. 
 
[^p.203^] 
[}The Operation on the moysture 
of the Body. 4.}] 
 
[}The History.}] 
 
[/177./] 
TWo kinds of Bodies (formerly 
mentioned concerning 
living creatures) are hardly 
consumed: hard bodies, as 
Mettals and Stones; fat, as 
Oyle and Waxe. 
 
[/178./] 
Therefore the moysture of 
the Body must bee hardened, 
and made fatty or dewy. 
 
[/179./] 
Moysture is hardened by 
firme foode, by cold thickening 
the skinne and flesh, and 
by exercise compacting the 
juyce; that it may not bee soft 
and frothy. 
 
[^p.204^] 
[/180./] 
Beefe, Porke, Venison, Goat, 
Kid, Swanne, Goose, and 
Woode-pigeons; especially 
beeing powdred, also dryed 
Salt-fish, olde Cheese, and 
the like, are firme sollid 
meates. 
 
[/181./] 
Oaten bread, or Miscelline 
bread made of Pease, Rye, 
and Barley, is more sollid 
than wheaten bread, and 
the course Wheaten bread, 
or browne bread that is fulll 
of Brane, is sollider than 
White bread made of purer 
flower. 
 
[/182./] 
The Orcades feeding on fish, 
and beeing generally fish-eaters, 
are long liv'd. 
 
[/183./] 
Monkes and Hermites living 
sparingly on drye foode, 
commonly attayned to a great 
age. 
[^p.205^] 
[/184./] 
Pure water beeing mingled 
with Wine or Drinke, hardens 
the bodies moisture, and because 
the Spirit of the water is 
dull and piercing, Nitre may 
be therewith mingled. And so 
much for the firmnesse of nourishment. 
 
[/185./] 
People living abroad in the 
open ayre, the cold thickning 
their skinne and flesh, no longer 
liv'd than Dwellers in houses; 
and in cold Countries, the Inhabitants 
attaine unto a greater 
Age, than in hot Countries. 
 
[/186./] 
Many thicke cloathes on the 
bed, or backe, doe loosen and 
soften the body. 
 
[/187./] 
Washing the body in colde 
Baths, doth lengthen life, 
but hot Baths are very bad. 
Baths of binding Minerall 
[^p.206^] 
waters were formerly mentioned. 
 
[/188./] 
By an easie idle Life without 
exercise, the flesh is made dissipable 
and soft, being by stout 
exercises used without excessive 
sweating and wearinesse, 
compacted & hardned. Swimming 
is also a good exercise, & 
generally all exercises abroad, 
are better than within the 
house. 
 
[/189./] 
Frications by a kind of exercise 
fetching out, not hardning 
nourishment shall be hereafter 
handled in its proper and due 
place. 
 
[/190./] 
To make hard moysture, 
oily, and dewy, is a perfecter 
worke than hardning, being 
attended with no inconvenience, 
whereas hardners of 
moysture, staying the Consumption, 
[^p.207^] 
and hindering the 
Reparation, and Renewing of 
Nourishment, do thereby further 
and hinder long Life. 
But oilie and juycy Nourishment 
by bedewing the Body, 
is lesse dissipable, and more 
reparable. 
 
[/191./] 
This Dewy fat moysture 
of the Body is no tallowy 
fatnesse, but a Radicall Dew 
diffused and spread through 
the body. 
 
[/192./] 
Oily fat meates are not 
converted agayne into fat, 
perfect Substances returning 
not agayne into one and the 
same Substance, but Nourishment 
doth after maturation 
and Digestion breede an 
oylines in the bodies moisture. 
 
[/193./] 
For oyle and fat alone, 
and also in mixture and composition, 
[^p.208^] 
are hardly dissipated 
and wasted. For water is 
sooner consumed and Dryed 
than oyle alone, sticking longer 
in paper or a Napkin before 
it be Dried. 
 
[/194./] 
To breede this oylinesse in 
the body, roasted or baked 
meate, is better than boyled 
or stewed, or dressed in any 
kinde with Water, more 
oyle beeing Distilled and 
extracted out of drye substances, 
than moist. 
 
[/195./] 
And generally all sweete 
things doe moysten the body 
with this oylinesse, as 
Sugar, Honey, sweete Almonds, 
Pine-Apples, Pistacke-nuts, 
Dates, Raysons, 
and figs; but all sower, salt, 
sharpe meates doe breede no 
dewy oylinesse. 
[^p.209^] 
[/196./] 
Also Seeds, Nuts, and roots, 
the Maniches using no other 
dyet, are good with meat & in 
Sawces, for all kinde of bread 
beeing the confirmer of 
meats is made of Seedes or 
rootes. 
 
[/197./] 
But Drinke, being the Waggon, 
carrying downe meate, 
doth especially moisten and 
soften the body. Therefore 
Drinkes not sharpe or sower, 
but ripe and cleere are best, as 
VVine (beeing as the old wife 
sayd in Plautus) toothles with 
age; also stale Beere and Ale 
beeing not sharpe but ripe and 
pleasant. 
 
[/198./] 
Metheglin strong and olde 
is a good Drinke, but beeing 
incorporated with Sugar 
insteede of Honey which is 
sharpe, as the Water is 
[^p.210^] 
by Chymists thence extracted 
would bee better, especially 
after a yeare or sixe moneths 
age, the rawnesse of the water 
beeing then gone, and the 
Sugar growne subtil and spirituall. 
 
[/199./] 
But olde Wine and stale 
Drinke beeing subtill and full 
of oylinesse, are also Spirituall 
and sharpe, and not 
so Good; therefore Porke 
or Venison well boyled being 
laid into Vessels of Wine, 
Ale, or Beere, the spirits of 
the wine and of other lyquors 
feeding thereon will lose their 
sharpnes. 
 
[/200./] 
Also Beere or Ale, bread of 
Wheate, Barley, and Pease, 
with Potato roots, Bur rootes, 
and other sweete rootes, to the 
quantity of a third part, is better 
[^p.211^] 
to prolong Life, than drink 
made onely of Graine. 
 
[/201./] 
Flowers also being not sharp 
or biting, are good sawces and 
sallets for meate, as Ivy-flowers 
with Vinegar taste pleasantly, 
and Marigold leaves, 
and Betony flowers in broaths. 
So much of the operation in 
the bodies moisture. 
 
[}The Operation on the inward 
parts to make them digest 
and drive out 
nourishment. 5.}] 
 
[}The History.}] 
 
[/202./] 
HOw the Stomacke, Liver, 
Heart, and braine, 
the principalls parts and 
[^p.212^] 
Fountaines of Concoction, 
may be comforted, and made 
to performe their offices, by 
imparting Nourishment and 
spirits to the severall parts, 
and renewing the Body, Physicall 
Rules and Prescriptions 
doe declare. 
 
[/203./] 
The spleene, gall, reynes, 
midriffe, small guts, and lights 
being members serving the 
principall parts, are here considerable, 
because their Diseases 
cured by Physicke, may 
bee derived to the principall 
parts: But by good digestion, 
and the soundnesse & strength 
of the principall parts, life is 
prolonged, and the Body nourished, 
and kept from decaying 
in old age. 
 
[/204./] 
But Medicines and Dyets agreeable 
to the state of bodies, 
[^p.213^] 
and comfortable to the foure 
principall parts, are in Physicke 
prescribed. For Medicines 
and Physick are necessary 
to recover and preserve 
health, but Life is chiefly 
lengthned by a good Physicall 
diet, prescribed in these choise 
Receipts following. 
 
The stomack resembling the 
[/205./] 
good man of the house, and 
being the cause of all Concoction 
and Digestion, must be 
fortified and strengthened, by 
being kept temperately warm, 
retentive, and cleane without 
oppressing humours; not empty, 
or fasting, being nourished 
by it selfe more than by the 
veines, and lastly in appetite, 
whereby Digestion is sharpned. 
 
[/206./] 
Warme drinks are also very 
[^p.214^] 
good. For a famous Physitian 
would usually at Dinner & 
supper eat a messe of hot broth 
very greedily, and afterward 
wish that he could cast it up again, 
saying that he needed not 
broth, but the broths warmth. 
 
[/207./] 
At supper the first cup of 
wine, Beere, Ale, or any other 
kinde of Drinke, must bee alwayes 
warmed. 
 
[/208./] 
A draught of wine wherein 
Gold was quenched is good at 
meales, the Gold having no 
vertue, but as other mettals, 
yet Gold quenched in liquor, 
leaves therin a binding power, 
without other qualities belonging 
to metals. 
 
[/209./] 
Sopps of bread dipped in 
wine wherein Rosemary and 
Citerne barke have beene infused 
with sugar, are better 
[^p.215^] 
in the middle of meales than 
wine. 
 
[/210./] 
Quinces are good to strengthen 
the stomacke, but syrrup 
of Quinces taken alone after 
meales, and with vinegar before 
meales, is better than 
Quinces beeing somewhat too 
heavy for the stomacke. 
 
[/211./] 
Rosemary, Elecampane, Masticke, 
Wormwood, Sage and 
Mint, are exceeding good for 
the stomacke. 
 
[/212./] 
Pils of Aloes, Masticke, and 
Saffron, taken in winter before 
dinner, are also very good, the 
Aloes beeing first washed in 
Rosewater, and the infusion of 
Dragant in vinegar, and then 
dissolved in sweet fresh oyle of 
Almonds. 
 
An infusion of wormwood, 
[/213./] 
with a little Elecampane and 
[^p.216^] 
Sanders, may be sometimes used 
in Winter. 
 
[/214./] 
In Summer a draught of 
white Wine of the infusion of 
powder of Pearle, and powder 
of River Crevises shells, 
and a little chalke, doth very 
much refresh and strengthen 
the stomacke. 
 
[/215./] 
But all cold morning-draughts 
commonly used, as 
Syrrups, Decoctions, Whey, 
Beere, or Ale, are unwholesome; 
coolers being not good 
for an empty fasting stomack, 
but five houres after Dinner, 
and an Houre after a light 
Breakefast they may be used. 
 
Fasting often is bad for long 
[/216./] 
life, and so is also all kind of 
thirst; for the stomacke must 
be kept cleane, but alwayes 
moyst. 
 
[^p.217^] 
[/217./] 
The annoynting of the 
back-bone over against the 
mouth of the stomacke, with 
good fresh Oyle-olive, of the 
dissolution of Mithridate, is very 
co~fortable for the stomack. 
 
[/218./] 
A bagge of locks of Wooll, 
steeped in sharpe Wine, after 
the infusion of Myrtle, Cytron 
Barke, and a little Saffron, 
is good to be worne alwayes 
next the stomack. And 
so much of comforting the stomacke, 
handled more largely 
in other operations. 
 
[/219./] 
The Liver must be kept from 
Inflammation, drynesse, and 
obstruction happening in Age, 
the waterish loosenesse thereof 
being a disease. 
 
[/220./] 
To the Rules hereunto belonging, 
delivered in the Operation 
of blood, these choise 
[^p.218^] 
Prescriptions may be added. 
 
[/221./] 
Pomegranate-Wine, or 
Pomegranate-juyce newly 
squeezed into a glasse, may be 
taken in the Morning with 
some sugar, and a little Citron-bark, 
and three or foure whole 
Cloves, and used from February 
to the end of April. 
 
[/222./] 
Young Cresses taken either 
raw, or in broth, or drinke, are 
exceeding good, and also 
Spoonewort. 
 
[/223./] 
Aloes washed, and allayed, is 
hurtfull to the Liver, therefore 
not commonly to bee taken. 
Rheubarb dissolved in 
sweet oyle of Almonds, and 
Rose-water is good for the 
Liver, being taken before 
meate, because a dryer; and 
at severall times, either alone, 
or with Tartar, or a little 
[^p.219^] 
Bay-salt, lest by purging away 
the thinne matter the humours 
should become tougher 
and harder. 
 
[/224./] 
Take the Decoction of 
Steele twice or thrice a yeere 
to loosen Obstructions, and 
stoppings in the liver, two or 
three spoonefuls of Oyle being 
first taken, and the Body, 
especially the Armes, and 
fore-part of the stomacke afterward 
stirred by exercise. 
 
[/225./] 
Sweete Drinkes keepe the 
Liver from growing dry, Salt, 
hot and cold, especially being 
incorporated, and made of 
sweete Fruits and Roots, as 
Raysons, Iujuba, dry Figges, 
Dates, Parsnips, Potatoes, 
and Lickorish. Also Drinke 
made of Indian Maze, and 
other sweete Compounds, 
[^p.220^] 
is very good. It is an observation, 
that the keeping of the 
Liver fat and soft doth lengthen 
Life, and the opening 
of the Liver procures health, 
in obstructions joyned with infla~mations 
curing also drynes. 
 
[/226./] 
Succory, Spinage, and Beet, 
after their pith is taken out, 
being boyled in water with a 
third part of white wine, untill 
they bee soft, are with oyle 
and Vinegar good ordinary 
Sallets. Also Sperage-buds 
and stalkes, and Burre-rootes 
well sod and seasoned, and 
Broth made with young Vine-buds, 
and blades of greene 
Wheate are good. So much 
of strengthning the Liver. 
 
[/227./] 
Because the heart receives 
most benefit or harme by the 
vapours of the ayre drawne in 
[^p.221^] 
by breathing, or by affections 
and passions, therefore the 
former Rules concerning the 
spirits may bee thereunto applyed, 
but no Physicall Cordials 
but Antidotes, strengthening 
the heart and spirits to 
resist the allayed poyson. 
These Cordials are formerly 
mentioned. 
 
[/228./] 
A good ayre is better known 
by Experience than Signes. 
The best ayre is on a levell open 
playne, the soyle being 
dry, not barren and sandy; but 
naturally bearing wild Bettony, 
Fetherfew, and wilde 
Mints, shaded with some trees, 
and Black-berry-bushes, and 
watred with no great river, but 
with cleare gravelly brooks. 
 
[/229./] 
The Morning Ayre is healthfuller 
than the Evening Ayre, 
[^p.222^] 
which is accounted more pleasant. 
 
[/230./] 
An Ayre somewhat rugged, 
and stirred with a gentle winde, 
is better than a calme cleare 
Ayre; and in the Morning the 
west-wind is best, but the North- 
winde in the Afternoone. 
 
[/231./] 
Sweet odours and smells are 
very comfortable to the heart, 
yet a good ayre hath not alwaies 
a good smell; for as pestilent 
ayres have no very bad smell, 
so oftentimes wholesome aires 
are not very sweete and fragrant: 
but the odour and sent 
of a good ayre should bee interchangeably 
taken, for one continuall 
excellent odour or sent 
oppresses the spirits. 
 
[/232./] 
Nosegayes are good in the 
open ayre, but growing flowers 
yeeld the best odours and 
[^p.223^] 
sents, as Violets, Gilliflowers, 
Pinkes, Beane-blossomes, 
Linden-buds, Vine-buds, 
Honey-suckles, Pellitory-flowers, 
Muske-Roses, 
(other Roses yeelding no 
great sent) withered Strawberries, 
Blackberry-bushes 
in the Spring, Wilde Mint, 
Lavendar; and in hot Countries 
the Orange-tree, Citron, 
Myrtle, and Bay: Also walking 
and sitting in such sweete 
Ayres is very good. 
 
[/233./] 
Cooling smells are better 
for the Heart than hot sents: 
therefore in the Morning, and 
at Noone, the steame of perfumes 
made of Vinegar, Rose-water, 
and Wine, put into a 
Brasse-pan, being received 
into the Braine, is very good. 
 
[/234./] 
And wine powrd on the earth 
[^p.224^] 
digg'd or turn'd up, being no 
sacrifice, yeelds a good scent 
and smell. 
 
[/235./] 
Also Orange-flower water 
mingled with Rose-water, and 
Brisk-wine, and being smell'd 
unto, or infused into the 
nostrills, is very good. 
 
[/236./] 
Small Pills made of Amber, 
Muske, Lignum Aloes, Lignum 
Rhodium, Flower deluce-roots, 
Roses, Rose-water, 
and Indian Balsam being 
chewed, and held in the 
mouth, are comfortable for 
the heart and spirits. 
 
[/237./] 
Vapours arising from Medicines 
taken inwardly to strengthen 
and cherish the Heart, 
must bee wholesome, cleare, 
and cooling, hot vapours being 
naught; for Wine yeelding 
hot vapours, is like 
[^p.225^] 
Poppey in quality. Cleare 
vapours are such as have more 
vapour than exhalation, being 
not altogether smoaky, and 
oyly, but also moist. 
 
[/238./] 
The chiefest Cordials used 
in dyet are Amber-Grise, Saffron, 
Kermes, being hot and 
dry, and for coolers Buglosse, 
and Borage-roots, Oranges, 
Lemmons and Apples. Also 
powders of Gold and Pearle 
doe coole the blood, and stomacke, 
leaving no bad quality. 
 
[/239./] 
Bezar-stone being not taken 
in Broath, Syrrup, or Rose-water, 
but in Wine, or Cynamon-water, 
or some other 
water not hot or strong, is an 
approved Cordiall for the spirits. 
 
[/240./] 
Observe also that great constant 
and Heroicall desires doe 
[^p.226^] 
strengthen and enlarge the 
heart: and so much of the heart. 
 
[/241./] 
Opium, Nitre, and other inferiour 
drugs procuring sleepe, 
are good for the Braine, being 
the Animall spirits seate and 
residence, and protected or 
annoyed by the stomacke; 
and therefore stomacke Cordials 
are comfortable also for 
the Brayne, as these Receipts 
be, three wherof are outwardly 
& one inwardly applyable. 
 
[/242./] 
Bathe the feet every week in 
a bath made of Lye, Bay-salt, 
Sage, Camomile, Fennil, sweet 
Marjoram, & Angelico leaves. 
 
[/243./] 
Suffumigations also, or perfumes 
of dry Rosemary, dry Bay-leaves, 
and Lignum Aloes, (for 
sweet Gummes oppresse the head) 
are good every morning. 
 
[/244./] 
No hot drugs or Spices, except 
[^p.227^] 
Nutmegs, may bee outwardly 
applyed to the Head, 
but unto the soles of the feete 
they may be laid: but annointing 
of the Head lightly with 
Oyle, Rose-water, Myrtle-water, 
Salt, and Saffron mingled together, 
is very good. 
 
[/245./] 
A Morning potion of 3. or 4. 
graines of Oyle, of Bezars 
stone, with a little Angelico seed 
and Cynamon, once in 14 dayes 
being taken in the Morning 
doth strengthen the braine, and 
thicken & quicken the spirits. 
 
[/246./] 
All these Cordials taken in 
Dyet doe comfort the Braine, 
variety of Medicines being the 
Daughter of Ignorance, many 
Dishes breeding many Diseases, 
and many Medicines 
effecting few Cures. And 
so much of the Operation on 
[^p.228^] 
the principall parts, for extrusion, 
and driving out of nourishment.
