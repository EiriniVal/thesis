Of Drinke, and what things in the use thereof to be considered: of morning 
draughts, drinking betwixt meales, beginning or ending the 
meale with drinke, and drinking ton bed-ward.}] 
 
AFter meat it is seasonable, now, to come to 
drinke, the one being as necessary, if not more 
than the other. This liquid substance helpeth 
the distribution of the food thorow the whole 
body; withall, quencheth thirst: and as without 
[/1./] 
food, so likewise without drinke, the life 
of man cannot be prolonged. And although 
wee read of some, who without any drinke at 
all, have spunne out the whole threed of their 
life; as namely one [/2./] Lasyrtas Lasionius, Andrew 
of Argos Mago of Carahage, and Iulius Viator, a Roman Knight; yet is it 
most certaine, that without drinke, or some moisture to conveigh the 
meat thorow the body, man cannot subsist: and such persons were not 
of a sound constitution of bdoy; and that because they did not sweat at 
all, their bones being all solid without any marrow. And our stomack is 
not vnfitly compared to a pot with meat boyling in it, which without 
moisture, must needs be burnt up. Besides, drinke seemeth to be of 
a greater profit and utility to the body than meat it selfe, and the 
want thereof hardlier to be indured, it allaying both hunger and thirst, 
in man especially: and therefore the old [/3./] aphorisme holdeth here 
true: It is easier to be refreshed with drinke than with solid food. Drink is a thin 
liquid substance, quenching thirst, furthering the concoction and distribution of 
the food thorow the whole body, and often also apt to nourish the same. Drinke 
[/4./] 
is two-fold, either that common liquor, whereof all living creatures 
are partakers as well as man: or else it is desumed from beasts and 
plants; from the which a wholesome liquor or juice is expressed, fit for 
quenching thirst, and nourishing the body also. Now, some rules concerning 
[/5./] 
drinke are carefully to be observed; and first wee are not to indure 
[/6./] 
too much thirst, but moderately to drinke in time of need, especially 
at our meales. In the next place it is good to drinke little and often 
[/7./] 
at our meales; to the end there may be an exact mixture of our meat 
and drinke in the stomacke: neither are wee to follow the custome of 
the people of the East, to drinke most after meales, as is also the custome 
of our beasts. Thirdly, wee are not to beginne our meales with 
[/8./] 
drinke, but rather with solid food. Fourthly, wee are not to drinke betwixt 
[/9/] 
meales, for feare of disturbing and interrupting the concoction 
of the stomacke; except a very hot and dry stomacke, sometimes 
for feare of burning up the meat, plead privilege, for a cup. 
Fifthly, after bathing, running, or any other violent exercise, it is not 
[/10./] 
[^p.112^] 
good suddenly to drinke either water or strong drinke; but especially 
water, or small drinke. [/11./] Hippocrates maketh mention of a wrestler, who 
after violent motion and agitation of his whole body, and all covered 
with sweat, drinking a great draught of cold water, died suddenly: 
and this was also the fatall end of the famous Physitian Valerius Cordus. 
Many more such histories are related by the [/12./] learned Schenckius. And in 
France my body being then in the like case, and had almost bin made an 
addition to the former examples. For after a draught of cold water in the 
[/13./] 
heat of Sommer, I was immediatly after surpized first with a single, and after 
with a double tertian fever: and to adde yet unto my former miserie, I was shortly 
after, about the beginning of the canicular daies surprized with the blody flixe, 
(at that time epidemicall, and for the most part mortall in most places of France, 
especially Southward) the which, together with the former infirmities, did adhere 
unto me almost a quarter of a yeere; and recovered not my full strength againe 
for the space of a whole halfe yeere and upwards. Now as meat, so is 
drinke not to be excessively and inordinatly used, but stinted and limited 
to a certaine determinate quantity. And howsoever, I confesse, it 
is impossibe to regulate, and determine how much every particular and 
individuall person ought to drinke; and that by reason of the difference 
[/14./] 
of countries and climats, of divers and various constitutions, and severall 
obseruable circumstances; yet may we still aime at a certaine 
decorum, or golden mediocrity alwaies, as in other things, so in this diligently 
to be observed. The antients, as it seemeth, observed even a set 
number of draughts at their set meales; which [/15./] were 3, as witnesseth 
the Poet: and the same number was determined by the Synod of Nants. 
Democritus, as witnesseth Pliny, wrote a booke, wherein hee averreth, 
that no man ought to drinke foure draughts at one meale: and it was 
a saying of the antients, the first draught is good against drought, the 
second is for mirth, the third for pleasure and delight, and the fourth 
made one madde. But because the number of draughts is nothing, the 
quantity of the draught, being that wee are to build upon; therefore 
that was also regulated among the antients. 
 
[/16./] 
There were among the antient Romans three usuall measures for 
drinke, called by these names, triens, sextans, deunx. The milddlemost was 
the least, being under foure ounces, and with the which, sober people 
contented themselves: that called triens was about a quarter of our 
wine pint, not above foure ounces: the last was above our wine pint. 
Sober people contented themselves with the smallest measure; and 
such as assumed some more liberty, proceeded to the other: but 
intemperate persons would adventure on the last and biggest measure. 
[/17./] Cato allowed to labouring men, and such as wrought hard, about three 
English pints of wine aday; which, perhaps, was then ordinary for 
such kindes of people. 
 
But mee thinks I heare some, by reason of that which hath beene already 
[/18./] 
said, aske mee a question, whether a draught of drinke in a morning 
fasting, be not, in the rules of wholesome diet, to be allowed of? 
Their colour to cleare this their custome, is this: a draught in a morning 
(say they) washeth downe all ill humors, that lie in the stomack, 
or places adjoining, and withall, is good against the stone. I answer, 
[^p.113^] 
thy draught is either strong drinke, or small: if strong, then have 
I the authority of our famous antient Physitians on my side, that this 
is very hurtfull to the health. Indeede, during the Empire of Tiberius 
Cæsar (saith [/19./] Pliny) the Physitians some fortie yeeres agoe, appointed 
that people should drinke fasting; and that onely by meanes 
of some cunning Physitians, willing by some plausible novelty to skrew 
themselves into the favour of the people. And it seemeth there is some 
recent authoritie, at least to beginne our meales with drinke. But 
Galen is flat against this preposterous custome of drinking thus fasting; 
[/20./] 
averring, that to drink strong drink fasting, is very hurtfull for the nerves 
and nervous parts, and withall, hasteneth and procureth to the body many 
[/21./] 
dangerous diseases, as Epilepsie, Apoplexie, and many others. It is 
therefore farre better for thy health to eat a little before thou drinke. 
But some will say, I will take but a draught of small drinke, which is 
[/22./] 
good against the stone. To this I answer, that howsoever this be a 
seeming reason, yet to mee it is none at all: for, by this meanes thou 
causest the more speedie descent of those glutinous and feculent humours 
toward the kidnies and bladder; and by consequent, rather furtherest 
than hinderest either the generation or increase of the stone: 
as the like is also, by the unseasonable, and too frequent use of diureticall 
medicines often procured. But if thou wilt drinke, then the 
[/23./] 
best will be to eat a little before thou drinkest, and this, like a 
Sponge, will drinke up this liquor, and afterwards these superfluous 
excrements will at great leisure be thorow the guts expelled out of the 
body. Some hot and dry bodies, may, perhaps, plead for some privilege, 
who, of all others, are most to be excused, especially, if they be 
not rheumaticke; and in such a case, let not the drinke be too strong. 
And as for antient people, and cold constitutions, who, perhaps, will 
take it ill to be abbridged of their morning draught; of wines, muscadine, 
sweet canary, and the like, with a tost soked in them and eaten, 
are the best, and a cup of good wholesome ale, with a tost, some 
nutmegge and sugar may be allowed. But the ordinary use of morning 
draughts, being indifferently of every one used, is not so good for the 
health of the body, whatsoever our tost-pots prate to the contrarie. 
And now I proceed to the next. 
 
In the next place it may be demanded, whether it be good to begin 
[/24./] 
our meales, as likewise to end the same with a draught? As for the 
first, it hath beene by manr holden as an oracle to beginne the meale 
with drink; which was also held by the [/25./] Salernitan Schoole, and 
with us it is holden for an ordinary and inveterate custome to beginne 
our meale with a cup of sacke. Now, as in many other things, 
so in this particular also, can we set downe no certaine precise rule, 
which may fit every particular individuall constitution. But this, according 
to my opinion, and of our Physitians of the best note, is the 
best for health, in ordinary constitutions, and the most part of people, 
to beginne their meales with solid food. And from this rule none 
[/26./] 
is to be exempted, unlesse some hot dry constitution; and in such 
bodies, the pot may be washed, (as some use to say) or rather moistned 
[/27./] 
before the meat be put into it; providing alwaies there be no pottage, 
[^p.114^] 
or other liquid meats; in which case they may well supply the place 
of drinke. And besides, as concerning the use of such moist and liquid 
food, the more an ordinary stomacke useth thereof, the lesse drinke is 
[/28./] 
needfull; and not, as too many use needlessely and foolishly to drinke 
immediatly after hot pottage. And as concerning rheumaticke persons, 
I wish them to be sparing both in the use of pottage and drinke; 
especially when rheume is most busie. And as for a cup of sacke, it 
cannot be indifferently good for every one at the beginning of meales; 
but onely for feeble, phlegmaticke, cold and old constitutions, and 
that immediately before meales: for otherwise it may even hurt such 
[/29./] 
constitutions, especially, if subject to any diseases of the head and 
nerves: as Epilepsie, Apoplexie, Palsie, &c. Now to the next, whether it 
be good to finish our meale with meate or drinke? To finish the feast 
with a draught of good drinke hath beene alwaies a very ancient custome, 
as by many antient Authors appeareth, which I could easily 
[/30./] 
here make good, if I feared not to trespasse upon the Readers patience. 
[/31./] The Iewes, it seemeth, were accustomed both to beginne and end their 
feast with such a draught; and of the beginning therewith, the practice 
of our Saviour Christ in [/32./] Luke maketh it cleare. The English 
have long continued this custome, as witnesseth the learned [/33./] Erasmus; 
and is so used among the Germans, and many other Europæan people, 
even at this very day, being commonly used after the washing of the 
hands, which in Scotland they call the grace drinke: and from the 
washing of the hands, this drink tooke the name, and was called [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
or [^GREEK OMITTED^]. The Germanes call it Saint Iohannis segen, or 
Saint Iohns blessing. [/34./] Now by antient Authors it may appeare, 
that there were cups called after three severall names used about that 
time: one was drunke in honour of Iupiter, called Olympius, or in honor 
of all the gods: the second was in honor of deified men, whom 
they called Heroes; such as be our Popish canonized Saints: the third 
was in honor of Iupiter Saviour, called perfect, from the number of three, 
wherein is the beginning, the middle and the end. By some also this 
was called the cup of health or good lucke, which they dranke one to 
another: and by some also it was called the cup of their good spirit or 
God, which was used both at the beginning, and ending of their supper 
before they rose from table. And after this last cup was once drunk, 
then all the guests rose, and all was taken away; as may by that sacrilegious 
pranke plaied by Denis the tyrant appeare: who comming into the 
temple of Æsculapius within the city of Syracuse, where was the statua, or 
image of Æsculapius, with a table of pure gold standing by it, tooke a cup full 
of wine, adding these words, I drinke to thee Æsculapius, the cup of the good 
God or spirit, and with this word caused presently carry away this golden table. Among 
the Indians it was called the cup of Tantalus. But now to the solution 
of the question, whether is it better to close our stomacke with meat 
or drinke? I answer, that for the generall, and for the most part, it 
is holden, that it is best to close it up with meat; yet with a limitation, 
[^p.115^] 
that such as are hot and dry, and are troubled with thirst 
[/35./] 
may drinke a little at the latter end of their meale. And of such 
is Celsus to be understood, when hee willeth us to close up the stomacke 
with a cup of cold water (a custome I am sure would not be 
very welcome to the Swill-bowles of our times) and that of Hippocrates, 
who in feare of fumes and hot vapors arising up, and fuming 
into the head, adviseth us to use this water or else very thinne waterish 
white wine. But there are many pleasant astringent meanes 
which in such cases may better bee used; as namely, marmalad of 
quinces, of goose-berries, preserved quinces, conserve of barberries, 
of rasps, and many other such things astrigent and acid in taste. Howsoever, 
it is the best course ordinarily to close the stomacke rather 
with meate than drinke, according to this verse: 
 
Sit tibi postremus semper in ore cibus. 
Let a morsell of meat be ever last in thy mouth. 
 
Now the answer to the other question, whether it bee good to 
[/36./] 
drinke to bed-ward, or going to bed, is concluded to the negative, 
that we are not at all to drinke at that season, for feare of hindering 
concoction. But if the body be hot and dry, the stomacke especially, 
and the partie thereunto accustomed, and sometimes in extraordinary 
great thirst, heere something is to bee yeelded to necessity: 
in which case it is good to be sparing, and when concoction 
is almost finished, as foure or five houres after meales, a more 
liberall draught may then bee allowed. And this may likewise 
serve for an answer to that question, whether one may drinke betwixt 
meales? So that I shall not need to make any repetion, concerning 
[/37./] 
this point. As for very aged people, of cold windy stomackes, 
I shall not find fault wirh them, if they take a little 
draught of sacke, or such liquor at the end of their meale. 
 
[^p.116^] 
[}CHAP. XXV. 
Of Water as it is used for drinke, and severall waies of cooling the same, 
and correcting bad Waters.}] 
 
HAving discoursed of Drinke in generall, as 
wee have done in meats, so must wee here 
come to the particular sorts of drinke; amongst 
[/38./] 
which, Water offereth it selfe in the 
first place, as the first and most ancient; so 
the most common to all living creatures, most 
obvious and easie to come by. And although 
after the flood, wine came in request for mans 
use; yet by many passages, both of holy 
and prophane Writers (whom for brevities 
sake I here passe by) it may appeare that water was the most common 
and ordinary drinke, and wine used more at festivall times, and solemne 
meetings, than for their daily and ordinary use; and it is even 
at this day so used in many places. As for the division of waters, 
their variety and diversitie, I have already said sufficient, as also concerning 
the qualities: whereas, I shewed, that water was not of so cooling 
a qualitie, as hath beene by many, both Philosophers and Physitians 
hitherto deemed. A late [/39./] Writer confirmeth this same opinion 
by the authority of divers other writers, by valid and probable reasons 
thereto perswaded. The chiefe and principall reasons are desumed 
from the inbred principles of this element; as light, heat, agitation 
and mobilitie; which constitute and make the essence or being 
thereof: as also from the actions; as the manifold generative power, 
perspicuity, raritie; the taste also, bitter, salt and sweet, &c. Of 
the other quality of moisture there is no controversie. Now, concerning 
the drinking of water, wee are herein to consider three things, the good 
quantity, the quality, and the order. The qualities of the best water 
have already largely beene described, and that among all waters, 
raine water was the best; and next unto it, the best spring water, or 
good river-water. In quantity, it must not exceed: for so it would 
hinder the concoction of the stomacke. And as for the order, it must be 
drunke, as is already in the generall directions of drinke set downe; 
little, and often at a meale. Vsed before meales, it moistneth much dry 
bodies, and cooleth more than sacke, or any wine whatsoever, be it never 
[^p.117^] 
so small; and therefore fitter for hot and drie bodies, than wine or 
strong drinke. Vsed after meales, it inhibiteth and hindereth the hot 
vaporous fumes of strong drinke to ascend into the braine; and so is said 
to resist drunkennesse: but I advise weake stomackes to looke unto 
themselves, for feare of too much debilitation, proceeding from too 
much humectation. And howbeit in hot countries, their water, by 
reason of correction by the splendor of the Sunne-beames is accounted 
wholesomer than ours; yet might ours be farre more used than it is, 
especially by hot and dry bodies, especially such stomacks; and yonger 
people especially: but this is the mischiefe, that such commonly 
powre downe most strong drinke, by this meanes adding fewell to the 
fire, untill Fevers, inflammations, and such furious diseases, in the 
very Aprill of their age bring them to an untimely death. And the 
poorer sort, I am sure, might make more use of the same than ordinarily 
they doe; which would better become them than go a begging strong 
drinke; or which is yet worse, steale, to procure mony to buy it. And 
notwithstanding this our nicity, I know som honourable and worshipfull 
Ladies who drinke little other drinke; and yet injoy more perfect 
health than most of them that drinke of the strongest. Two things do 
most deterre people from the use of this noble antient drinke, the coldnesse 
and the crudity. As for the coldnesse, howsoever it doth often 
actually to the palat appeare such; yet have I shewed that there is no 
such intense cooling quality here to be feared. The other is the crudity; 
which is indeed nothing else but the abundance of moisture, 
wherewith it is indowed; and most offensive to weake and moist stomackes: 
and all is notwithstanding ordinarily imputed to the coldnesse 
of water. Some to correct what they deeme amisse in water, use 
to adde some sugar to it, and so thinke all is well amended, and is most 
practised by the female sex. But this is no good correction: for of this 
they cannot be ignorant, and experience teacheth no lesse, that sweet 
things doe rather hurt than helpe a weake and tender stomacke. And 
besides, Sugar being but temperately hot could adde but a little heat 
to such a drinke, if it were as cold as is supposed. Againe, sugar having 
no drying quality ascribed unto it; but rather a meane moisture, 
it will rather adde to, than detract ftom this moist quality. But in my 
opinion, the best correction is by boiling it first, and then if thou wilt, 
adde thereunto a little hony or sugar, and a little wine vineger (which 
well correcteth the moisture, and joined with the other sugar or hony, 
giveth it a pleasant rellish) thou maiest make thee a pleasant and 
wholesome drinke. 
 
Now as concerning the boiling of waters, there is a controversie about 
[/40./] 
the quantity, or how much should be boiled away; some willing 
to boile water to the wasting away of the third part, others of the 
[/41./] 
halfe, which others againe thinke too much; and indeed a meane is 
[/42./] 
the best, Againe, some would have water corrected by distillation; 
which I must needes confesse to be best, if not too costly: besides, 
[/43./] 
that it is not so easy every where, and at all times to be effected. Some 
straine it thorow a cleane linnen cloth; and some againe boile it with 
[/44./] 
sand. Some with corall beaten to powder correct the bitternesse of 
[^p.118^] 
waters; and some attribute a correcting qualitie to Penniroall. Pliny 
reports, that bitter waters are made sweet and potable by casting into 
[/45./] 
them a little meale or flowre of wheat; so that they may bee drunke 
within two houres after. I doubt this triall would hardly answere our 
expectation. And I am sure the practice of the [/46./] Prophet Elisha in 
healing the water with salt, was miraculous. It is familiar with mariners 
after the use of evill waters to eat garlicke. The Arabian Physitians 
[/47./] 
advise him, who is to remove his habitation to a place where 
waters are not good, to carry with him some of the earth where hee 
lived before, and mingle with his water, and being well strained, drink 
of it. 
 
[/48./] 
Now because oftentimes water is either somwhat warme, and therfore 
quencheth not the thirst so well; or else is not so cold as to please 
some nice and curious palats: therefore partly for pleasure and wantonnesse, 
and partly for necessity; especially when all manner of riot 
and excesse began to reigne, amongst many other things, were devised 
severall waies to coole both their water and their wine. And it 
cannot be denied that cold water doth better further the concoction of 
the stomacke than warme. And [/49./] Galen, in Sommer alloweth of very 
cold drinke; yea; even cooled with snow, and to such especially as 
labour hard, and use much exercise: but others that live idly, leading 
a sedentary life, and free from imployment, either of body or mind, he 
adviseth to drinke water, as nature hath produced it, without any alteration. 
Avicen wisheth alwaies to eat before they drinke water, and 
[/50./] 
to drinke sparingly and often at our repast, and out of a vessell with a 
narrow mouth; that so the draught may be the more moderate. There 
[/51./] 
were six several waies the antients used to coole their water, by means 
of the aire; which was familiar to the Ægyptians; as witnesseth [/52./] Galen. 
In the Sommer (saith he) the Ægyptians of Alexandria, having first 
well warmed their water, and put it up in close earthen vessells, exposed it to the 
night aire, and before Sun rising, set them in some shadie places of the ground, 
environed round about with cooling herbes. Sailers have beene seene sometimes 
to expose their water to the night aire, and afterwards cover 
their bottles with many clothes: and thus it is very certaine it reteineth 
still the cold quality. The reason why they thus boiled their water, 
was because that water once boiled receiveth sooner and easilier 
the impression of the cold aire; as witnesseth the [/53./] Prince of Philosophers. 
And therefore in Pontus, where they fish alwaies in frost, they 
besprinkle their angling rods with warme water (which afterwards 
congealeth and freezeth so much the harder) which serveth them instead 
of glue. The second way of cooling water, is, by letting it downe 
[/54./] 
in an earthen bottle into a deepe well: howbeit others are of opinion 
it receives some evill impression from this close water; and therefore 
[/55./] 
thinke it better to draw up the water, and so set it in it. The third way, 
is by injection of some salt peter, which afterwards for a while is stirred 
about with a sticke: howbeit this is not so well approved of, with 
whatsoever present satisfaction it may seeme to sooth us up. The 
fourth way, is by meanes of ice or snow. It was the invention of the 
[/56./] 
Emperour Nero to boile water, and then let it downe into a pit of snow. 
[^p.119^] 
[/57./] Athenæus saith, it was an old invention, howbeit others affirme it 
first found out by Nero. [/58./] The Turkes at this day familiarly use this 
kinde of cooling their drinke. The fift way, is by meanes of deepe cellars, 
[/59./] 
wherein in antient times, some were wont to set bottles full of 
hot water, and take them out againe colder than any snow. In Paris 
there are some such deepe cellars, wherein the smallest wines will 
seeme to the taste, twice as strong as they are in very truth. Besides all 
the premisses, water falling from a high place, acquireth unto it selfe 
a greater coldnesse than that which runneth softly in a river; and the 
[/60./] 
agitation and much stirring of the water furthereth not a little this 
cooling qualitie. And this for the present concerning the use of water 
shall suffice; what resteth shall be discussed in the diet of the diseased, 
which doth something also concerne them. 
 
[}CHAP. XXVI. 
Of wine: the various and severall sorts, with the right use, and for 
whom it is most fitting.}] 
 
IT may be my former discourse of water was to 
some unwelcome, who would more willingly, 
perhaps, heare of some more noble liquor; 
and therefore now from the water-pale to 
the wine-pot. Now although this same subject 
of wines alone might well fill up a larger 
discourse than this in hand; yet will I 
content my selfe with such things as shall 
be of greatest use for the health of mankind. 
And because al wines are not alike, differing 
in divers respects, it will therefore be for us very usefull to set downe 
[/61./] 
the severall differences. Wines therefore differ not a little one from 
another, and that in these respects following. The first difference 
[/62./] 
then is desumed from the age; for some wine is called Mustum, or 
[/63./] 
new wine; and others of longer continuance, one, two or three yeers, 
&c. New wine, before it be well purged from the lees, howsoever it 
may seeme to please the palat, by reason of a sweet pleasant and delectable 
taste; yet is it most dangerous for the health of the body. 
[/64./] for by reason of the thicknesse, grossenesse; and (as some call it) a 
tartareous substance, it is very windy, and apt to ingender all manner 
of obstructions, wind cholicke, and the stone it selfe, &c. But among 
all such wines, the white and Rhenish doe least harme; and that in regard 
they make the body soluble, and so all corruption is evacuated, 
and so in regard of their short abode within the body, they are least of 
all others offensive unto it. New wine pressed out of tart and sowre 
grapes is of all others the worst. The [/65./] Poet Ovid could well tell whether 
new or old wine were better, when he wishes to drinke wine of 
[^p.120^] 
the continuance of certaine Consuls; that is, so many yeeres old. And 
as the new wines are not to be allowed for ordinary use; no more are 
the very old wines better to be liked of: for then they become farre 
hotter, sharper, and sometimes bitter also. As for the certaine determinate 
time or age, when wine might safeliest be drunke, no man can 
certainely determine, for some lasted twenty, some more, some fewer 
[/66./] 
yeeres. Cicero at a supper with Damasippus was served with wine of 40. 
yeeres old. But the Emperor Caligula was presented with wine of 160. 
yeere old. Now the nature of such wines was this, that they were 
not to be drunke, unlesse mastered with much water. Our wines now a 
daies differ much from those in frequent use among the Ancients, the 
Romanes especially: for few of our ordinary wines will continue good for 
yeeres, as theirs did; yea a yeere, and sometimes lesse, will put them 
to the period of their longest endurance. Although I deny not but 
some of our sackes, and some such strong wines will continue good 
[/67./] 
farre beyond this prefixed period. The second difference is taken 
from the substance; some being thinne, perspicuous and very small, 
needing no admixture of water, called for this cause [^GREEK OMITTED^] such as 
grow plentifully about Paris, Rochell, and divers other places; as along 
the river of Rhene, in Thuringia, Misnia, &c. And yet Cardan thought 
no such wine grew in those regions. Others againe were of a thicker, 
and grosser substance, and may therefore be called [^GREEK OMITTED^], or bearing 
much water, as being of farre greater force and strength than the former. 
The third difference may be taken from the colour; some being 
[/68./] 
white in colour, some pale yellow, some fadder in colour, or of a high 
golden yellow colour; some againe of a blackish intense red, and others 
of a pale red colour. The yellow wines are the hottest, the red lesse; 
and the white least of all. And it is to bee observed, that mingling 
grapes of divers colours, the wine becommeth of a mixt colour: as the 
white and red grape mingled together maketh a claret; and the more 
red grapes be in the mixture, the higher coloured is this claret; and 
the more white grapes, the paler coloured it is; approaching both to 
the colour and quality of white wine; as is to bee seene in that wine 
[/69./] 
called from the colour of peach flowre, couleur du pesche. The fourth 
difference is taken from the taste, sweet, sowre, sharpe or bitter. The 
sweet are most nourishing, such as are commonly the high coloured 
red wine, and some sweet sacks brought unto vs from Greece, and other 
parts: such as are our malmesey, muscadine, browne-bastard, Canary, 
and some others of that colour; and our high coloured red wines, called 
vin de Graves. Some againe are of tarter taste, as most of our white 
and claret. Galen was of opinion, there were no sweet white wines; 
howbeit divers Provinces of France can now witnesse the contrary. 
And I doubt not but the Wine-brewers of the City of London have 
so well profited in their profession, that they are able to furnish any 
with as sweet wine of any colour as any other place whatsoever. The fift 
[/70./] 
difference is desumed from the smell, which in wine is also not a little 
to be regarded, and the wines of best smell are also ordinarily the hottest. 
Among our ordinary wines, that which smelleth like the raspe, 
as the French say, sent la fram boose, is esteemed the daintiest. But here 
[^p.121^] 
my meaning is not of any artificiall smell procured by the wit and 
invention of the vintner, no more than that which already hath bin 
spoken concerning the substance, colour and taste. Another difference 
may yet be desumed from the soile, and the naturall temper of the aire 
where such wines grow. And thus in one and the same country are so 
many severall sorts of wine to be seene, differing in goodnesse one from 
another; and yet far more those of one countrey from those of another. 
And thus we may apparently perceive what a great difference there is 
in the wines of that one kingdome of France. The wine of Orleance, although 
farre to the North, yet doth it exceed in goodnesse many others 
more to the South. And we see severall countries produce divers and 
severall sorts of wine, and some againe produce none at all: and that 
partly by the unfitnesse and coldnesse of the soile and climate; and 
[/71./] 
partly in some places, by meanes of the neglect and ill husbandry, or 
ignorance of the inhabitants. And there is yet another difference desumed 
from the faculties: for the thicke red coloured wine tending to 
[/72./] 
blacke, especially the sweetest, are of all others aptest to nourish and 
fatten the body. But whosoever useth them much, let him take heed 
of obstructions, the stone, the dropsie, &c. Such wines grow plenteously 
in Gascony, and from thence conveyed to their chiefe citie Burdeaux, 
and so to divers places of the Christian world. All sweet wines 
[/73./] 
loosen the belly more than any other kind. The other sweet wines, such 
as we named heretofore, are hotter than the former, and yeeld somewhat 
to them in this alimentary facultie; and are rather of the antient, 
and married people, yet sparingly to be used; than of the yonger sort. 
In France alone many severall sorts of wine, differing not a little in 
strength one from another. The wines of Orleance are of prime note for 
[/74./] 
goodnesse; as also the wines of Aniou and adjacent places are in no 
small esteeme: and those wines in so great request at the French court; 
[/75./] 
called vin de Coussy and D'Hay, are very wholesome and dainty wines. 
But the wine about Paris, Rochell, and many places of Xaintonge are but 
poore small wines in comparison of the former. Againe, in Gascoigne; 
but especially in Provence, Languedoc, and the south parts of that Kingdome 
are many strong and generous wines, eqnalling, if not exceeding 
divers wines of Italy it selfe. But it is now more than time, wee come to 
the temperature of wine, the knowledge whereof doth not a little 
make for our purpose. 
 
Concerning the temperature of wine, there hath been some controversie 
[/76./] 
among the learned, which we will leave to the schooles, & briefly 
declare that which we conceive to bee most profitable for our purpose. 
Wine then of all sorts, whatsoever, is undoubtedly hot, howbe 
[/77./] 
it some more and some lesse; and new wine is at first colder, and in 
[/78./] 
time acquireth a greater heat; insomuch that must or new wine is by 
Galen accounted cold; which must be understood comparatively, having 
respect to that it is afterwards. Now this heat acquired by the 
ebullution is of a great latitude and extent, according to the severall 
natures and ages of wines. Thinne small wines, especially white, 
[/79./] 
participate of least heat: old strong wines are very hot: that which 
is betwixt both these extremes, is also of a meane heat betwixt both. 
[^p.122^] 
[/80./] 
But now concerning the second quality, and joined with this first, whether 
it be moist or dry, is in like manner controverted. In a word, I 
thinke it to be actually moist, howbeit potentially dry, as we speake 
in the schooles. For howsoever it moisten, as is the nature of all liquors, 
yet hath it a certaine faculty of drying up superfluous moisture; as 
we see come to passe in many other liquors extracted out of hot simple, 
vegetables or mineralls: and yet this drying faculty differeth not a 
little according to the strength. It is moreover to bee observed, that 
[/81./] 
our wines much differ from the wines used in antient times, in regard 
of their strength. With us our new wines are hotter than our old, 
which by little and little, their heat decaying, grow dead: Vappescunt. 
Contrariwise, the wines of antient times being new, that is, not exceeding 
five yeeres age, were not so hot as those of greater age, which 
perhaps had atteined to ten or twelve yeeres. The longer they were 
[/82./] 
kept, the greater heat they contracted, which was not naturall; but 
procured by art: for they were accustomed to mingle with their new 
wine, pitch, rosen, brimston, plaster, ashes, &c; to adde smell and 
quicknesse to their wines. Some used also to smoake their wines: and 
for this end, had certain places in their houses built for this same purpose. 
Others againe mingled therewith sea-water fetcht superstitiously 
from the deepest Ocean. By so many poisons cause we wine to please 
our palats (saith Pliny) and yet wonder at the woe they procure us, yet inclining 
still to vice. Let Londoners, and others that frequent the city much, 
looke about them, and moderate their insatiable wine-bibbing humor, 
lest withall they drinke downe some of this stuffe, whereof Pliny here 
complaines. Sure I am our Vintners are as cunning, and witty in 
invention for their owne profit and commodity, as ever were any of 
the antients. But concerning the hot facultie of wines, it may perhaps 
be replied, how commeth it to passe, if all wines be hot and dry, it 
[/83./] 
produceth cold and moist diseases in the braine: I answer in a word, 
it commeth not so to passe properly by reason of these faculties; but 
by accident, these exhalations being by the braine quickly converted 
into such a substance. And that this is true may by this appeare, that 
the excesse of drinking of the strongest wines are aptest to ingender 
such diseases. 
 
[/84./] 
Now this noble creature moderately used, is a most soveraine meanes 
to restore and renew our decaied and dead spirits; and to preserve the 
naturall heat of the body: and for the great affinity it hath with the nature 
of man, and sympathy with the heart, it is as it were in a moment 
conveied thither; and so produceth that famous effect of [/85./] cheerefulnesse, 
so often in holy writ ascribed unto it. But the use of this so noble 
a creature is not indifferently to be permitted to every age, person 
and complexion. Plato would not have children to drinke any wine 
before the 22. yeere of their age. [/86./] Aristotle forbiddeth wine to nurses 
and children. [/87./] Hippocrates permitteth the use of it to some cacochymicall 
dispositions, and to women of a soft and soggy, or spongious 
flesh. [/88./] Galen setteth downe what constitutions it best befitteth. 
To those of mature and ripe yeeres he permitteth wine, but well watered; 
but to hot and dry constitutions, hee forbiddeth it altogether, 
[^p.123^] 
water better befitting the state of such bodies, to whom assenteth also 
[/89./] 
Hippocrates. As for old age, especially if very phlegmaticke by constitution, 
vvine is not to be denied them; it being for them a wholesome 
milke, and withall a convenient food for the preserving and cherishing 
of the radicall moisture, and innate balsame of their bodies. 
 
But from hence ariseth some doubt, in that I allow wine to old men; 
My doubt may seeme so much the stranger, in that it seemeth this opinion 
hath alwayes gone currant without any controll. But there is 
[/90./] a late writer, who hath contradicted this opinion, and would have 
them when they grow in yeeres, to use wine vvell diluted with water, 
and aftervvards vvhen they are novv atteined to decrepit old age, to 
give them onely hony-vvater, or boiled vvater to drinke. But I thinke 
fevv that read this, but vvill thinke this too rigid; and so am I of 
their mind. His reason is because (saith hee) hot strong wine drunke 
in abundance hath need of a like proportion of naturall heat to overcome 
it, otherwise it sowreth in the stomacke, oppresserh naturall 
heat, ingendreth crudities, and proveth the cause of many noisome diseases. 
But by his good leave, although a learned man, yet he delivers 
his opinion too lavishly and without limitation. Wine in old age moderately 
taken cheereth the spirits, furthereth concoction, and overco~meth 
crudities. The chiefe hurt befalleth old age by the too liberall 
use of strong hot vvines, in my opinion, is by way of exiccation, their 
bodies howsoever replenished with an accidentall and excrementitious 
moisture; yet the naturall Crasis and constitution of their bodies 
get, inclining to siccity. The excesse in the use of any sort of wine I 
allow not of. But I see no sound reason, why the moderate use of our 
Muscadines, sweet Canary sackes, and sweet nourishing red wines 
may not safely and to good purpose be allowed this age, which besides 
the former benefits may likewise by their mild fumes and vapors so 
irrigate the braine, that it may procure them quiet and comfortable 
sleepe to this age so acceptable. And by this moderate use I see not 
but it may likewise communicate a gentle warmth to all the parts of 
the body; although I am not of opinion this is the only use, as this Author 
seemeth to allege. 
 
And in the use of wine among the antients this is yet to be observed, 
that they were either to drinke this or water, there being no other in 
ordinary use among them, and therfore, wheras they allowed youth at 
the age of 22. to drinke wine, this is not a precept for us to practise, being 
furnished with so fit and wholesome drink, and so appropriated and 
fitted for this climat, and our complexions; and the which may safely 
to any age or complexion be exhibited; and being in our owne power 
to make it weaker or stronger, there is no danger in the use of our ale 
or beere. And besides, we must also withall consider that in the hot 
seasons of the yeere both wine, and other strong drinkes must more sparingly 
be used, but in colder seasons we may be bolder. Now againe, 
[/91./] 
among the antients wine was either drunke pure of it selfe without any 
mixture; or else diluted and mingled with water, and is used also 
in this our age. In antient times some added water to the wine, and 
some againe wine the water. Water was, and is used to be added 
[^p.124^] 
unto wine, to allay and qualifie the heat and fumes thereof, and is 
more frequent in those countries, where wine is their ordinary drinke. 
This mixture differeth according to the diversitie of the natures, of the 
parties drinking, the wine drunke, together with the severall times of 
drinking: all which points are learnedly and largely set downe by [/92./] a 
famous Italia Physitian; and which were too long for mee here to insist 
upon. But this I must advertise in briefe, that as young people, especially, 
hot and cholericke constitutions, ought not to drinke wine; so if 
they doe at any time drinke thereof, they ought to delute, or mingle it 
with a greater quantity of water than others: and the like I wish to 
be understood of the heat of Sommer, when as both smaller drinke, 
and wine more deluted is best. Some in stead of ordinary spring water, 
use rose water, and a little sugar, which is not amisse: and the like may 
be practised with Srawberry, Sorrel, Succory, or Endive water. But 
to determine the quantity of water, which differeth according to circumstances, 
is very hard: but the best will be for people to consider of 
that proverbiall speech, Every man is either a foole, or a Physitian. The 
meaning is, a man should observe what best befitteth the state of his 
owne body, and so accommodate all things accordingly. Many in hot 
countries where the wine groweth, sometimes use wine so sparingly, 
that they adde but a little quantity of wine to a great quantity of water; 
it may be not the fifth or sixth part. But with us, where wine is not our 
[/93./] 
naturall and ordinary drinke, this deluting, or mixture of wine and water 
is not so frequent; except sometimes in Sommer, where often, and 
most commonly sugar is also added thereunto, with some Borage flowers, 
and a sprig of Rosemary, which are not out of purpose; especially, 
if the wine be any thing tart, or sowrish. 
 
[/94./] 
And by the way I must here say something concerning the use of sugar 
with wines: It is a common custome thorow this kingdome, to adde 
sugar to all wine indifferently sweet or sowre, or whatsoever sort. I doe 
not deny but sometimes, to helpe a tart taste, or to inhibit the hot fumes 
of a vaporous or strong sacke, apt to flie up into the braines, a little sugar 
helpeth well: but to use it indifferently, with all sorts of wines, and 
without consideration of circumstances whatsoever (which is the 
ordinary and common custome) and that merely for wantonnesse, and 
to satisfie their lustfull desires, I hold it not convenient. Our neighbouring 
Nations, who abound in all sorts of wine, and most somewhat 
tartish in taste, yet never use this addition of sugar. And therefore, as I 
advertised already, so wish I all, especially our women (aptest in such cases 
to exceed) to use a moderation in the use of sugar. As for wines thus 
to be mingled with water; they must be indifferent strong, and withal, of 
an indifferent thinne substance. Wines of a grosse and thick substance, 
are not thus to be mingled with water; but rather moderately and sparingly 
drunke without any addition. And as for our Rhenish and small 
white wines, they need farre lesse water than other stronger. [/95./] Some 
wish that certaine houres before the wine be drunke, water be mingled 
therewith, that by this meanes there may be more perfect mixture 
of the one with the other. There is to this purpose a certaine antient 
speech recorded: Vinum lymphatum cito potatum generat lepram, Wine 
[^p.125^] 
mingled with water, suddenly drunke, ingendreth leprosie. But concerning 
wine this shall suffice. Of the use of wine in the sicke, in what diseases 
useful_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], and how to be used, hereafter in the diet of the diseased. 
 
[}CHAP. XXVII. 
 
Of Beere, Ale, Cider and Perry serving us in stead of Wine.}] 
 
NOw, because all countries are not furnished 
with this noble liquor of the grape, therefore 
our gracious God besides this element of water, 
with man-kind, common to all living 
creatures, hath furnished these our Northern 
Regions with other drinkes, which might to 
us supply the place of wine. This drinke hath 
[/96./] 
for its principall ingredients water and corne, 
and to season it, and make it keepe a long 
time in stead of salt, hath hop added to it. 
And that this is no new invention to make drinke of corne; but hath 
beene in frequent practice in antient times, may by the relation of our 
antient Physitians plainly appeare. The [/97./] Egyptians, it would seeme, 
were the first authours thereof. But it may be objected, that the antients 
doe likewise condemne this drinke, as most unwholesome for the 
body of man. [/98./] Dioscoride ascribeth to this drinke, which hee there 
calleth Zythum & Curmi, differing but little one from another, a noxious 
quality against the reines, nerves, and nervous parts; as the membranes, 
of the head especially: and affirmeth that it ingendereth 
wind, filleth the body with corrupt humours; and leaveth the body using 
it much, the leprosy for a legacie. [/99./] Galen singeth also the same song, 
and confimeth his assertion. But whatsoever was the opinion of the antients 
concerning that drinke, and that it was of that nature, I will not 
[/100./] 
deny; yet i am sure, the drinke wee make is both wholesome, and very 
agreeable to our nature; and besides, is farre otherwise prepared, than 
that of antient times. Now, of this drinke, there are two sorts; one brewed 
without hop, commonly called Ale; the other with hop, and 
[/101./] 
commonly called Beere. In Beere then, as in wine, there are many differences 
to be considered, where the first is taken from the corne it is 
made of; it being sometimes made of one grane, sometimes of another, 
and sometimes of more granes mingled together: but with us, most 
commonly malt is made of barlie alone, which doth also with us heere 
most abound. Some doe also mingle some oats with this drinke, and 
so make it more cooling for Sommer, very quicke to the taste, and 
wholesome for the bodie; the oat being of it selfe daintie, wholesome, 
and nourishing graine. Some to adde strength to their Beere, 
especially that called March-Beere, then brewed to last all the yeere, 
adde thereunto a few pease. In some places beyond seas, they make 
[^p.126^] 
Beere of Wheaten malt: as in some places of Saxony and in Bohemia; 
which much needs be good and wholesome, if no errour in the making 
be committed. Another difference againe is taken from the age and 
[/102./] 
duration of this drinke: some being very new, some very old, and kept 
a long time. Very new drinke is very hurtfull for the health, ingendring 
both wind and crudities with obstructions, and many diseases from 
thence proceeding; as hath beene said of new wine. That which is 
very long kept, must needs be strong; a_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] our March Beere, and some 
others; and yet are not so good for ordinary use, but rather now and 
then as physicke. The best and wholesomest, is that of middle age. 
A maine and principall difference is taken from the strength, and is 
[/103./] 
esteemed by the proportion of the malt to the liquor: and this varieth 
much, according to severall circumstances; as the place where one 
liveth, the persons who are to use it, the season and time of the yeere, &c. 
This neverthelesse is to be observed, that in Winter and cold weather, 
strong drinke is more tolerable than in Sommer, and warme weather; 
and to old age, there is a greater liberty allowed, than for younger 
people. Another difference is taken from the substance, thick or thinne, 
[/104./] 
and perspicuous or cleare. Thicke and muddy drinke is altogether unwholesome, 
and the mother of many diseases: and that which is cleare, 
is best and wholesomest; providing alwaies, that water be not too 
much master. Thicke beere ingendreth wind, all manner of obstructions, 
the stone, strangury, and many more dangerous diseases. Againe, 
that difference taken from the taste is not to be neglected; some being 
[/105./] 
bitter, some sweet, some sowre, &c. And this the age will often alter: 
for very new drinke, if much hopt, must needes be bitter: and very 
small drinke, if long kept, especially in Sommer, will grow sowre. A 
meane is best, that it be not too bitter, too hot and heady, nor sowre at 
all: and therefore another difference may be taken from the quantity 
[/106./] 
of hoppe, that a due proportion thereof be observed; it being hot and 
dry in the second degree, and sometimes weaker, and sometimes stronger: 
and too bitter drinke is more physicall than is for our ordinary use 
fitting. The best course then is to let the hoppe rot in the drinke (as 
the vulgar people) before wee drinke it. There is another difference 
[/107./] 
taken from the colour; some being of one, and some of another colour; 
some pale; some of a reddish, some of an amber colour, &c. The highest 
coloured drinke is not alwaies the strongest and wholesomest. That 
which looketh of a pure transparent yellow amber colour, like a pure 
sacke, is reputed the best. The best March beere, if well brewed, and 
no error committed, is often of this colour; and the goodnesse of the 
malt whereof it is made, and the fewell wherewith it is dryed, maketh 
[/108./] 
yet another difference, and often altereth both the colour and taste 
of the drinke. Straw is thought better than wood for drying of malt. 
In some places of this Iland, in the Northerne especially, they dry their 
malt with ling, or heath, called there hadder, which maketh very 
good malt; some also use furres, or whins, as some call them; and some 
againe; broome. But straw, and heath, or ling are the best; the solider 
the substance of the fewell is, the worse it is, there being the more 
danger of over-drying the malt, which may make both the drinke taste 
[^p.127^] 
worse, and looke with too high a colour. The Barlie whereof the malt 
is made must be good and fresh, not light, lanke, or worme-eaten, fusty, 
&c. And besides, it must not be made of Barly too new, before it 
hath sweat in the mow (as husbandmen use to speake) and is also to 
be made in a convenient season; I meane not in a hot season of the 
yeere, and therefore commonly called in the countrie, cuckow malt. 
The last difference is taken from the water whereof the drinke is brewed; 
[/109./] 
and the best, if it may be had, is to be preferred before the other, 
and in defect of the best, the next best is to be chosen. And what is 
the best we have already at large related: and we find here that many 
times our well water maketh the drinke looke of a higher colour than 
is sutable to the strength thereof. And to the water we may adde the 
fire wherewith it is boiled, which I thinke is best to be wood, and such 
as we allowed of in making of the malt. And yet I confesse good drinke 
is, and may be brewed with sea-coale, as wee see in all the city of 
London: and the fewell is not so materiall here as in making of malt, 
where the smoake toucheth it immediately. Now all these differences, 
except that taken from the hop, are common both to ale and beere; 
the which in our Ale here is but little, and in the Northerne parts of 
this Iland is none at all. And because the hop maketh some difference 
in these two drinkes, therefore it will be usefull to say somthing 
thereof. Of the temperature of barley, a very wholesome graine, somthing 
[/110./] 
hath beene said already, and something yet more shall bee said 
hereafter. As for the hop, it openeth the obstructions of the liver, spleen, 
and kidnies, cleereth the blood, and cleanseth choler, and therefore 
this drinke must needs be very wholesome. But if there bee too much 
hop in it, or yet drinke very new, the hop will wrong the head, by sending 
[/111./] 
up to it hot exhalations, and so procureth rheumes; and the 
bitterer the Beere is, the lesse it nourisheth. 
 
Ale againe is of a grosser substance, and nourisheth farre more; but 
is of a more oppilative and stopping faculty: and therefore such as 
[/112./] 
are obnoxious to obstructions ought to bee sparing in the use of this 
drinke. Such as are leane, and free of this feare, may freelier use it. 
And although hop added to beere would seeme to make it hotter than 
ale, yet when the strength of it wasted, and not much discernible in 
the drinke, in regard of its penetration, and scowring away of choler, 
and the ale having like quantity of malt in it, I think there will 
be but little or no difference in their heats. Howsoever both Ale and 
Beere are good wholesome drinkes; the which if any one will deny, 
I will appeale to our owne experience: for where can you find stronger, 
healthfuller, and lustier people, than in those countries, where this 
drinke is most ordinarily used? And in this I dare be judged by [/113./] 
forren Writers, who lived in countries where this drinke is not used. 
Who so desireth to know more of these drinkes, and their severall 
sorts, according to severall countries, may have recourse to [/114./] Placotonius, 
who hath written at large of this subject. And what was said 
before concerning the use of wine, may here bee understood of our 
strong Ale and Beere, that they are not good for young people, hot 
and cholericke complexions, and hot seasons of the yeere. And this 
shall suffice concerning these drinks. 
 
[^p.128^] 
There are yet some other drinkes expressed out of fruits, and in no 
[/115./] 
small use among many people, called by these two names, Cider and 
Perry. Cider is the juice expressed out of Apples, and sometimes attaineth 
to that excellency, that it emulates wine in strength and vertue. 
The sweet is more windy, as when it is new; and therefore is not to be 
used untill it be 4. or 5. moneths old at least. It is better or worse 
[/116./] 
according to the fruit it is made of; and is best for hot and dry cholerick 
bodies, hot livers, and melancholicke persons: they are of an opening 
and penetrative nature, opening obstructions notably. 
 
Perry is sweeter than Cider, and withall windier, taking its denomination 
[/117./] 
from Peares whereof it is made, and differeth little in 
vertue from the former. These drinkes are very frequent, and used for 
ordinary drinke in the Province of Normandy in France; as also in the 
shires of Glocester, Worcester, and Hereford here in England. They are 
both very good to quench thirst, and to cut tough phlegme. 
 
Besides these drinkes in most frequent and ordinary use among us, 
[/118./] 
there are yet many other sorts of drinkes in frequent use among many 
nations: as in many places of the Indies, and other countries they 
made a wine of dates; and others againe, make a dainty wine or 
drinke of rice. And many nations of the West-Indies make drinkes of 
certaine roots and herbs. And no question wee might make drinke of 
divers other fruits and plants, if we pleased. It is reported that that 
antient and warlike people called Picts, inhabiting in former times 
a part of the realme of Scotland, made a dainty drinke of the herbe or 
shrub, ling or heath; the making of which notwithstanding, neither 
for love nor mony (as we use to speake) nor any other meanes could ever 
from them be extorted.
