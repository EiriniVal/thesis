[}Of Exercise and 
Labour.}] 
 
BEcause a greate part of Healthinesse 
consisteth in a conuenient and oportune 
exercise of the Body, as Auicen 
and before him Hippocrates and Galen 
affyrme, needefull it is to haue a diligent 
eye and consideration therevnto. It is 
commended for many speciall causes, 
[/1./] 
but namely because it beeyng duely and 
seasonablie vsed, will not suffre the substance 
of ouermuch meate engendrynge 
Surphet to clotter and co~gele within the 
body, and also maketh the whole bodye 
light, nymble and actiue. Furthermore 
it keepeth and merueilously stirreth vp 
naturall heate, restoreth the powers of 
the whole body, and strengthneth all the 
vertues therof. Small and weake heate 
it encreaseth, and dayly dissolueth the superfluities 
[^f.C1v^] 
by litle & litle gathered within 
the body, and conuaieth the same to 
such places from whence they be conueniently 
sent out and expelled. It also maketh 
the membres a greate deale the apter 
to receyue nourishment, because the 
filth and excrementall matter of the bodie 
is thereby scattered and auoyded. 
 
Moreouer it openeth the cunduites of 
the body, & the courses or passages wherin 
the bloud (hauyng therto the conuenient 
ministerie of the naturall powers apoynted 
for that office) is easely receyued 
and conuerted into the substance of 
the member: whiche continual nourishment 
is most necessarie vnto mans life. 
For without this vertue, present death 
ensueth. This gayne and commoditie 
is also gotten by exercise, that by expellyng 
superfluous humours it excuseth a 
man from the vsuall receipt of Purgations 
and Medicines. For wee must be 
very circumspect and take greate heede, 
[/2./] 
as Plato saith in Timæo, that we mooue 
not the body with medicines, and specially 
Electuaries soluble, if wee may otherwise 
[^f.C2r^] 
choose: because although they 
doo purge, yet doo they inueterate: And 
although there be no poyson in them (as 
in deede in the most of them there is) yet 
are they very paynefull to be taken inwardly, 
because their office is contrarie 
to nature. For they draw away from 
the membres those humours which the 
powers of nature doo draw to the same 
for a nourishment: and also because beside 
the ill humours whiche they draw 
out, they doo for the most part also draw 
out those whiche be good, and the vitall 
spirites whiche maintayne and comforte 
life. It is not therefore without good 
cause, that the learned & wyse Doctours 
of this Arte haue written so muche and 
so diligently of Exercise, that men therby 
might shunne and auoyde many sortes 
of diseases, whiche els woulde assault 
the body, by reason of sundry surphets, 
and gurmandise. For the substance remayninge 
after digestion and distribucion 
of the meate and drynke, (whiche 
Nature beynge ouercharged, is not able 
to concocte and euacuate, beynge eftsoones 
[^f.C2v^] 
encreased by eatyng and fillynge 
gorge vpon gorge, must needes engendre 
diseases: In this case to auoyde and 
eschew the recept of purging medicines, 
which serue either to recure the body beynge 
thereby sicke, or els to preserue it 
from beyng sicke, Exercise is a thynge 
most co~modious as the causes of maladies 
doo beginne so dayly hereby to expel 
the same. These noble writers therefore 
were of this mynde, that if the residue 
of theyr preceptes (whiche hereafter shal 
also by vs bee recited) were obserued 
and kept, bodyly health might very well 
in this consistent Age be conserued, yea 
and not in this age onely, but also in the 
Age whiche goeth before, and the Age 
whiche commeth after, a verie few pointes 
beyng thereto either added or els altered. 
As for any particuler Regiment 
for old age, we do not in this place namelie 
pursue, because beside Galene it is also 
[/3./] 
at large described & set out by diuerse 
other learned Phisicions, and namely in 
a seuerall booke penned and published by 
that famous and excellent Grayehead 
[^f.C3r^] 
Antonius Fumanellus of Verona. 
Thou shalt therefore (Gentle Reader) 
with al thy deuoyre and diligence, so vse 
thy selfe, that thou mayest passe ouer and 
lead this flourishing time of thine age by 
thine owne wisedome and our holesome 
counsaile in health and welfare, to the 
glory of god and the profit of thy neighboure, 
for this age of Consistence is the 
very flowre and prime of a mans life. 
And by this meanes shalt thou so doo, if 
thou geeue diligent eare to the sounde 
counsayles of approoued Phisicions, by 
mee in this litle Booke breefely noted, the 
chiefest whereof is Exercise. And therefore 
Galen playnly writeth that all such 
of his freendes as tooke diligent and speciall 
regarde to Exercise were neuer 
sicke. But because not euery kinde of 
Exercise, nor euery time and hower is 
conuenient and meete for it, therefore 
will I declare bothe the time when it 
should be vsed, and also the particuler 
kindes thereof. 
 
Then is it a fit time (saieth Auicenna) 
to exercise the bodie when there be no 
[^f.C3v^] 
[/4./] 
ill humours in the same, least exercise 
by motion and calefactio~ should disperse 
the same through the bodie or cause them 
to decline and goe to some principall me~bre 
and part of the bodie and so to putrefie. 
Also when there is in the Stomake 
or Bowelles no great qua~titie of meate 
vndigested or humours crude & rawe, 
least inconuenience might ensue by the 
conueighance of them into the officiall 
members, before they be throughly boyled 
and concocted in the Stomake. Furthermore 
to go to the Stoole and exonerate 
nature before the time of exercise, 
is very holesome. Hippocrates, his counsaile 
[/5./] 
is, that a man shoulde laboure and 
chase himselfe before his meale: and 
therfore I thinke it very vnholsome immediatetly 
after meate to vse exercise, 
because the vehement accidentes of the 
mind and the stronge mocions of the bodie 
do hinder digestion and cause Putrefaction, 
but an easie and soft walking, 
that the meate may the better and the 
sooner descend to the lowest part of the 
Stomake where the same is better concocted) 
[^f.C4r^] 
is not to bee misliked but is 
thought to be very holesome and expedient. 
Therefore when the meate is passed 
downe from the Stomake and the 
time approcheth eftsoones to eate, then 
is exercise both fit and profitable. In Somer, 
about the Sunne risinge, least otherwise 
the bodie shoulde be annoyed 
with a double heate: and in the beginnyng 
of the Sprynge, and Autumne aboute 
twoo howers after the Sunne rysing, 
that the coldenesse of the mornynge 
may be auoyded. For as the heate of the 
noone time of the day is hurtful and noysome, 
so is the colde of the mornyng, and 
namely in Autumne, and winter to be 
eschewed. Notwithstandynge a man 
may exercise himselfe at home assone as 
he ariseth. In winter Auicen counselleth 
vs to exercise our selues within the 
house, or in some close couert place, about 
noone, hauyng the ayre a litle warmed, 
for feare least colde els should take 
away or hinder that commoditie that exercise 
bryngeth: For nothynge is more 
hurtful to the vertue Regitiue then cold, 
[^f.C4v^] 
namely if it be much, and at suche time 
as the body is hoat. Now wheras there 
be sundrie sortes of exercise, I will onely 
recite here suche as I know to be best 
and most agreable for them, vnto whom 
I namely haue penned and written this 
compendie. 
 
And first to beginne with walkynge: 
[/6./] 
which if it be soft, and not fast, nor apace 
is a weake exercise and may best be vsed 
in hoate moonthes, & in the beginnyng of 
Autumne, for at those times heate and 
drinesse cheifly reigneth. And therefore 
the body ought not to be more inflamed 
and dried by stronge motion and exercise 
especially in a Cholerique man. For 
truely there is no time in all the yeere, 
wherein the body ought lesse to be exercised 
then in Sommer, and therefore in 
hoat Regions and Climates, a softe and 
gentle motion is a greate deale better, 
and more requisite then strong motion, 
because nothyng doth so muche incende 
and enflame naturall heate, as laboure 
and moouing. Often and longe walking 
vsed without intermission, is a stronge 
[^f.D1r^] 
exercise and meeter too be vsed in the 
Springe season, because exercise in the 
Springe time by good reason ought to 
be greater and stronger then in So~mer. 
And therfore somwhat long deambulacion 
being pleasa~t withal, not wearisome, 
nor excessiue, is in my oppinion very 
meete and apt for this season of the yeere. 
I meane, it must be somwhat longe, to 
thend it may with more facilitie resolue 
suche superfluities as aboute that time 
were gathered and congeled together 
duringe the winter precedinge: and I 
would haue it to be somwhat gentle and 
pleasant, least the bodies should be set in 
a chafing heate with too much Agitacion 
and stirring, especiallie of them that are 
of a hoate complexion. For this kinde of 
softe and longe continuinge exercise is 
most agreeable & commodious to hoate 
and moyst bodies. A strong and veheme~t 
walking, especiallie vp and downe highe 
and vnequall places, as many times to 
goe vp and downe a ladder, or a stiepe 
hill, till a man pant and fetche his breath 
thicke and often with difficultie, is a very 
[^f.D1v^] 
good and comendable exercise, & best 
to be frequented in cold & moyst seaso~s. 
 
There is an other kinde of exercise, 
[/7./] 
whereof Galene wrate, but not conuenient 
for such as be graue personages and 
men muche busied with waightie affaires, 
or for such as haue not their heads 
in good temperature, which is called the 
Tenise. In which kinde of pastime, all 
members and partes of the body are equallie 
mooued, but it is hurtefull to the 
head by reason of often stowpinge: and 
therfore I counsell all them that delight 
to playe thereat, to stand holdinge theire 
heades vpright, whiche may be easely 
done, by striking and receauing the balle 
with a raquet. 
 
There is an other kinde of pleasaunt 
exercise fittest to be vsed in the countrey 
in seasonable and tempestiuious times 
[/8./] 
of the yeare, called Riding. It is highlie 
to be commended and is good for the head 
stomacke and intrayles, wherby men in 
the olde time got both health & pleasure. 
 
That exercise whiche Auicen teacheth 
to draw and bring down humours 
[^f.D2r^] 
from the head to the lower partes of the 
body is very profitable and to be done in 
[/9./] 
this sorte folowyng: Tie and make fast 
a stronge roape to some Beame or post, 
and through the same roape put a good 
bigge wodden Cudgell ouerthwart, and 
takyng holde with your handes at bothe 
endes of the Cudgell, lift vp and poyse 
your body so, that your feete touche not 
the grounde, and mooue your legges to 
and fro, hangyng still by your handes. 
But the bodie must be very well purged, 
lest when the superfluous humours 
be drawen downe to the lower partes, 
there be engendred an Abscesse, which is 
some impostume or course of euill humours 
to some one parte of the body. 
 
As for wrestling and daunsing, which 
be accompted amonge vehement exercises 
(because they be nothyng agreeable 
and fitting for a sage Magistrate nor for 
a serious Student) I haue nothynge to 
say: but this by the way I may not omit, 
that those persons which feede vpon 
grosse meates, and suche repast as bringeth 
stronge nourishment, may vse vehementer 
[^f.D2v^] 
exercise and stronger ambulations, 
as running, wrastling, hunting, 
quoytes, handeball, and to be breife all 
suche exercise as best agreeth with theyr 
nature, which may brynge difficultie in 
fetchyng the breath, augment heate and 
humecte the skynne and exteriour parte 
of the body, with a thin subtile sweate. 
For quicke and nimble exercise maketh 
the body leane and slendre, and the contrarie 
maketh it grosse and thicke: much 
exercise drieth the bodie, but meane and 
conuenable maketh it fat and corpulent. 
Notwithstandyng, for them that vse a 
slender diet and spare feedyng, a shorter 
ambulacion and smaller walkynge will 
suffice. Now, there be some whiche be 
of a very hoat temperature & compexio~ 
which ought not at all to be exercised: for 
such persons, a moderate walkyng, baynyng 
[/10./] 
or a gentle Fricasie and rubbynge 
shalbe fully sufficie~t. Al such are slender, 
leane and very Cholerique. And this 
is euermore to be noted, y~ a man must 
vse such moderation in his exercise, that 
he get not a lassitude or wearinesse therwith, 
[^f.D3r^] 
but assoone as he perceaueth the 
same to come vpon him, it were best for 
him to desist and leaue of. For the bodie 
with all his partes ought so to be exercised, 
that excremental matter by idlenesse 
and rest, be not gathered. But when 
you beginne to sweate, and the exercise 
seemeth not to be so pleasant as it did before, 
ceasse and leaue of, wypyng away 
the sweate from your bodie: then again 
after that you haue a litle paused and rested 
your selfe, the body must be refresshed. 
For in exercise aswell as in meate 
and drinke and all other thinges, there 
ought to be a conuenient measure vsed, 
so that the thyng it self be neither ouercharged 
with to much, nor yet debarred 
from that stinte and sufficiencie that is 
needefull and requisite, because by excesse, 
the powers are enfeebled and dissolued, 
and by want or defect, there is so 
muche of the vtilitie abated, as there lacketh 
of due sufficiencie. For our powers 
are muche strengthened and cheered, if 
with moderate and fit exercise they be 
refreshed and cherished. Now let vs 
[^f.D3v^] 
breeifly declare the kindes of small and 
gentle exercises, whiche (notwithstandyng) 
to the health of the body are needfull 
and expedient. The first sorte wee 
haue heretofore declared, that is to say 
a sweete and softe walkynge. 
Then there are Fricasies or Rubinges, 
whiche are the exercises of them that be 
sickly. For vnto them that be in perfit 
health, they are not sufficient, as Plato 
most elegantly, and after him Galen affirmeth. 
But we adiudge and thinke the~ 
to be very good both to mu~defie the head 
and diuert the fumes therof to the vttermost 
and extreame partes, and also to open 
the pores and conduites of the bodie 
therby to extenuate and expell subtill humours. 
In olde time, men vsed fricasie 
and vnction before and after euerie kind 
of exercise: before, to the end that the passages 
and pores of the bodie beinge opened 
by fricasie, the humours might haue 
more easie egresse: and after, beecause 
the matter, which did exude & come out, 
might be wiped away from the skin, and 
that which remained in the fleshe, might 
[^f.D4r^] 
be extenued and dissolued, which order in 
my oppinion is not to be misliked. And 
therfore my counsaile is, that before thou 
arise out of thy bed, either to rubbe or els 
to make some bodie els to rubbe, with 
warme hands or som warme linnen clothes, 
thy backe, breast and bealy easely & 
softlie, and thy armes and legges hardlie 
and stronglie, but suche partes as thou 
canst reache and come vnto, vse to rubbe 
thy selfe. For this fricasie and rubbinge 
concocteth crude humours, and also nourisheth 
and comforteth the whole bodie. 
And if thou chaunce to sweate, cause it 
with a soft rubbing and fricasie to be wiped 
of. Hippocrates saith that hard fricasie 
doth binde and consolidate the bodie, 
softe doth loose and mollifie, muche doth 
extenuate and diminishe fleshe, meane 
augmenteth and maketh it wax bourlie. 
It is good also when you goe to bedde if 
your head be heauie or payned with the 
murre or reume, to rubbe and wringe 
hard your legges and handes, for by such 
meanes the vapours that ascend vpward 
are deriued and brought downeward. 
[^f.D4v^] 
Also fricasie and rubbing the whole body 
in the eueninge, is profitable for them 
that be throughly wearie, or with drines 
to much molested, or with the Atrophie 
& consumptio~ pined and troubled: which 
being done, there should ensue an oyntement 
or perfusion of temperate oyle (if 
the auncient and laudable custome of 
vnction were not antiquated and growe~ 
out of vse as many other good thinges 
are) for it helpeth to the speedines and velocitie 
of frication, it looseth and suppleth 
the members that be stiffe and indurate 
and it comforteth and mollifieth the me~bers 
that are wearied. 
 
[/11./] 
To be rowed vppon the water in a 
wherrie or barge is an exercise gentlest 
and easiest of all other. Now ouer and 
beside the fricasies aforesaide, let vs particulerlie 
recite those motions that do exercise 
not all, but certaine partes of the 
[/12./] 
bodie. To shoote in a longe Bowe, to 
pitche or throwe great Stones or any other 
heauie thinges sittinge or standinge 
is the exercise of the armes and other 
partes next vnto them, albeit the whole 
[^f.E1r^] 
bodie may seeme to be therin exercised, 
In readinge, to speake at the first with a 
softe voice, and afterward to speeke lowder 
and lowder is the exercise of the 
Tongue, Breast, Throate and Lunges 
yea it is good for the ventricle or Stomacke 
also. But the exercise of the heade 
[/13./] 
must verie carefullie be looked vnto, because 
amonge al the partes of the bodie 
the braine is the coldest, and therfore his 
naturall heate must with all diligent 
heede bee conserued and kept, that it bee 
not distempered nor oppressed with the 
multitude and abundance of superfluous 
humours. Therfore euerie daye when 
thou arisest, after that thou hast beene at 
the stoole, rubbe thy head with a cleane 
drie linnen cloath somwhat warme, fro~ 
the foreparte of thy head backewarde to 
the hinderparte, and at the first, let thy 
fricasie be small and easie, but afterward 
harder and faster. Then kembe it with 
a cleane combe, beginnynge at the former 
and vpper part of the head bringing 
the Combe backeward, and then againe 
mundify and make it cleane with linnen 
[^f.E1v^] 
clothes as is aforesayd. And if the same 
clothes be a litle perfumed with poudre 
of Lignum Aloes, or Gelouers and drie 
Roses, their vertue is a greate deale the 
more to helpe the brayne and comforte 
the sences. Certes thou shalt feele a merueilous 
effect for the healthinesse of thy 
head if thou vse this ordre of fricasie and 
combyng. For therby naturall heate is 
excited and stirred vp, the pores are opened, 
(which beyng stopped, superfluous 
matter and humours are retayned and 
consequently the brayne payned and affected) 
but beyng opened, the same il humours 
and fumes are propulsed and dispersed, 
and the brayne is made sincere, 
stronge aand healthfull. There is an opinion 
setled in the heades of many now adaies 
and especiallie amonge the commo~ 
sorte, that it is not good for the head to be 
wasshed, alledgynge for their proofe an 
olde sayinge, common almost in euery 
mans mouthe, neuerthelesse for y=e= moste 
parte vntrue, which is this: Wash thy 
[/14./] 
hands often, thy feete seldome, but thy 
head neuer. Unto whom I do breeifly 
[^f.E2r^] 
make this aunswere, that such persons 
ought namely to wash their heds, which 
haue a moyst brayne, or suche as loue to 
haue their heare grow longe, because the 
inwarde superfluities whiche nature 
would expell, cannot haue passage to euaporate 
and vente out, but be retayned 
still, by reason that the pores be stopped 
with filthe that lieth at the rootes of the 
heare next the head, which filthe by conuenient 
and orderly wasshyng is taken 
away and clensed. And for this cause 
Auicen affyrmeth that it is not good to 
suffre the heare of the head and beard to 
grow longe, because they gather and retayne 
muche grosse filthe and baggage, 
stoppyng the pores about the rootes, if 
they be not wasshed away. To these 
namely, and to all others generally that 
vse wasshynge, Auenzoar geeueth in 
charge to be wasshed with warme water 
or Lie, and if you put into the same 
water or Lie, so it be not to stronge, a 
small handfull of drie Roses, and Lignu~ 
Aloes, and a litle Camomile or Betony 
for such as be somwhat of a colde nature 
[^f.E2v^] 
it is very wholesome. He that hath a 
weake head, colde and moyste, and his 
memorie thereby empayred, shall in my 
litle booke of the Arte of Memorie finde 
moste souerayne, singuler and easie remedies 
to satisfie his desire. As soone as 
the head is wasshed, it muste diligently 
and speedely be wiped and dried with 
warme drie linnen clothes, and well looked 
vnto, y~ it catche no harme through 
colde or wynde. But better it is, not to 
be wasshed at all, especially in winter or 
often, and namely for suche as vse to be 
shauen and notted, but the Fricasies and 
combynges aforesayde must duely be vsed, 
because (beside the aforenamed helps 
that they bryng) they merueilously preserue 
the sight. The proper and peculier 
exercise of the sight is to beholde and 
[/15./] 
looke vpon small letters and lightsome 
thinges: foreseene, that a measure therin 
be adhibited, notwithstandynge Auicen 
supposeth that small and confuse figures 
& subtile or litle letters are hurtfull 
to the sight and not to be looked on. 
The exercise of the Hearyng is to heare 
[/16./] 
[^f.E3r^] 
pleasant sowndes, yea and sometimes 
great clappes and hideous noyse: but in 
any wise aswell in this as in all others, 
too vehement and stronge obiects must 
be warely and circumspectly eschued. 
 
[}Of Bathes.}] 
 
BAynyng sometimes supplieth the office 
[/17./] 
of Labour, and standeth in steede 
of exercise, beyng either ayrie or watrie 
in sweete water, for of Mineral waters, 
whiche wee terme Bathes I will 
say nothing, sithens they rather serue for 
curyng of diseases. They must vse the 
ayrie Bayne fastyng, that are corpulent 
and grosse or haue abundance of concocte 
superfluous humours and excrements: 
but y~ watrie better accordeth with them 
that are slendre, whose vse is diuers and 
manifolde, accordynge as the degree of 
heate is more or lesse, whereof Galen 
writeth thus: Sweete warme waters 
if they be temperate, their vertu is hoate 
and moyste, if they be well and hoate, 
[^f.E3v^] 
their vertue and force is moyst and cold, 
but if they be hoater then they ought to 
be, theyr strength is in deede hoate, but 
not accordyngly moyst. For they cause 
the body to shiuer and quake, and purseth 
together the subtile pores thereof, in 
[/18./] 
so much that it can neither be humected 
outwardly with accesse of humour, neither 
sende out any of the excrementall 
matter that is within. Furthermore 
he saieth, that Bayninge orderlye vsed, 
mollifieth and soupleth harde and indurate 
fleshe, and fetcheth out all the excrementes 
and liquide matter that cleaueth 
and adhereth after digestion to the 
exteriour parte of the bodie. They that 
haue fat and corpulent bodies or else bee 
replete with aboundance of humours, 
may soone take harme by vsing disorderlie 
and vnduelie this bayning, but if they 
be first purged and ridde from them they 
may vse the benefit thereof, because it 
doth humect and moisten the pores and 
passages, and maketh the fumosities 
too bee dispelled and sent out. But 
as in all other thinges moderate vse 
[^f.E4r^] 
is alwaies to be preferred before immoderate, 
euen so fareth it by bayning. For 
a man may not be ouer hastie in aduenturinge 
to vse it, especiallie if the partie 
that is minded to be bained, be troubled 
with many humours gathered throughe 
continuall cruditie and vndigestion, or 
haue not longe afore enfarced himselfe 
with plentie of meate vnboyled and vncocted 
in the stomake, whiche crude humours 
being within the bodie (by reason 
of the vehement force of heate) cause obstructions. 
In very colde seasons, and in 
Sommer time they shoulde also be forborne. 
For in winter the humours beinge 
stirred and disquieted and a cold sodeinlie 
succeding, they are driuen to som 
necessarie part of the body, & there breede 
diseases and great annoyaunce. And aboute 
midsomer when heate chieflie raigneth 
and of it selfe resorteth to the exteriour 
partes, Bayninge doth disperse so 
much of the same heate as is yet remaininng, 
& by y~ meanes much weakeneth 
the inward powers. And vnlesse the age 
and place of man seeme otherwise to require, 
[^f.E4v^] 
they are at this time a great deale 
more to be eschewed. In deede no man 
doubteth but baines vsed at due and seasonable 
times, help the bodie verie much 
(for nothinge doth so well concocte and 
driue away il humours & corrupt iuyce 
as sleepe after bayning) but I say that the 
vse therof is very hurtfull, if they be vsed 
at inconuenient times and when they 
ought chieflie to be refrained. Now as 
concerninge washing in colde water, I 
do say that it is vtterly to be forborne of 
all such as are not therto accustomed, as 
being more hurtfull then profitable, vnlesse 
vrgent occasion of great heate and 
lustie youth do otherwise seeme to craue 
it. But he that would vse it, must be slender 
of bodie and somwhat of a colde constitucion, 
for it is apter to pearce into 
suche colde within the bodie and inner 
partes. It bringeth al the humours in a 
maner to one place of the bodie and maketh 
the sinewes and muscles stiffe and 
numme, and not nimble or readie to 
mooue, yea and sometimes it bringeth a 
man into distemperaunce and passions 
[^f.F1r^] 
much worse then these, if it be not verie 
aduisedly vsed. And amonge all others, a 
healthy and sound bodie so long as it is in 
growing and waxinge, must not be washed 
in cold water, least his groweth and 
waxing be thereby rebuked and hindered. 
But when he is come to his full 
growthe, then may he acquainte himself 
with colde bathes, because the bodie is 
therby cooled and strengthened, and the 
skinne made harder and thicker. And the 
fittest time thereto is the beginninge of 
Sommer, that ere winter come, by frequent 
custome, it may not turne to any 
hurtfull distemperaunce of the bodie, and 
let it beginne in a verye hoate daye the 
place where it is vsed beinge likewise 
hoate. 
 
[}Of Meates.}] 
 
NOw let vs say somwhat of meate 
and drinke. And herein I do firste 
geeue the to vnderstand, that it is 
best and holsomest to vse meates that be 
[^f.F1v^] 
simple. For simple meate by good reason 
is most profitable, but many and sundry 
dishes and diuers sortes of Uiande and 
Cates is most hurtfull and a great enemie 
to health. Our predecessors whiche 
liued very long without Sicknes were 
wont (as Galen & Auicen affirme) to 
eate at one meale fleshe, and at another 
bread onely. Yet would I not wishe thee 
to accustome thy self to one onely meate 
specially if thou be in youth: for Galen 
expounding one of the Aphorismes of 
Hippocrates saieth: Such thinges as we 
haue long times beene vsed vnto, yea although 
they be not of the best nourishing 
meates, are not so daungerous and hurtfull 
as other thinges are which in deede 
be far better, wherunto we haue not be 
accustomed. We must therefore (saieth 
he) now and then altre our diet, and vse 
to eate suche meates as before we vsed 
not. Neither ought we to bind our selues 
to any one kinde, least if we should (perchaunce) 
be driuen at any time to change 
that custome, we should straightwaies 
therupon fall sicke. And Cornelius Celsus, 
[^f.F2r^] 
counsaileth suche as be in health, to 
vse their ordinarie fare and plaine vsuall 
diet. But to eschue & forbeare much varietie 
of meates is vndoubtedly bothe 
better and wholesomer, because the stomacke 
[/19./] 
is to muche set a woorke and laboureth 
greatly in the digestyng & concoctyng 
of sundrie meates at once. It is 
thought good (and so it is in deede) to mingle 
moyst with drie, colde with hoat, and 
hoat with colde, sweete and toothesome 
with sower and eigre. But those meates 
whiche be in the meane or mediocritie of 
all excesse are most commendable. Of 
[/20./] 
whiche sorte is Breade, made of cleane 
corne, sufficiently leauened, well moulded 
and moderately baked: also the flesh 
of Hennes and Capons, Phesants, Partriches, 
Woodcockes, yonge Pigeons, 
Blackbirdes, Thrushes, Turtles and 
suche like small byrdes. Semblably, 
suche fishes as breede amonge Rockes, 
and stones, or aboute the Sea side, and 
suche as in taste are neither vnpleasant 
and vnsauerie, nor yet clammy and vnctuous, 
of whom heareafter we will particulerly 
[^f.F2v^] 
speake. Notwithstandynge 
meates must be vsed accordyng to the diuersitie 
that is in bodies: for they that 
haue very melancholique bloud, muste 
vse moyste and hoate meates, they that 
be Cholerique must vse colde and moist. 
But phlegmatique persons must eate 
such meates as haue vertue to drie and 
[/21./] 
calefie. Furthermore the bloud is made 
most perfit and pure by vsing moderate 
exercise and suche meates as engendre 
good iuice, beyng eaten at due and seasonable 
howers, and in such quantitie as 
is required and by moderate and tempestiuious 
drinkyng. And in meates, nothyng 
so wel encreaseth and maketh good 
bloud, as for them to be throughly concocted 
and perfitly boiled in the stomake. 
For thereby is more easely finished, the 
second concoction whiche is in the veines 
and Liuer, and also admitteth the thyrde 
digestion which is in y~ particuler membres 
and partes which be nourisshed. 
A due ordre therefore is to be kepte in 
[/22./] 
meates: as for example: that whiche is 
slippery and moyst before that whiche is 
[^f.F3r^] 
stipticke and harde: agayne that whiche 
is more easely concocted before y~ which 
is of slow digestion: as potched Egges 
before fleshe and suche like. Likewise 
suche as are of theyr owne nature soone 
corrupted, as Mylke and moyst fruites, 
as wee shall hereafter more largely declare. 
For when meate of easie digestion 
is eaten after that whiche is slowly concocted, 
it is holden backe, and stopped by 
the meate of slow digestion before taken 
that it cannot passe into the entrayles, & 
therfore the meate of easie digestion beyng 
perfitly concocted remayneth and is 
forcibly kept in the stomacke longer then 
it ought to be, whereby it is made very 
apt to corruption, whiche to health is very 
hurtfull and a great hindrance. But 
there be some meates betweene whom 
there is but small difference of digestion, 
as between a henne and a sucking Calfe, 
a Chicken and a Kidde, the flesh of a big 
olde Calfe and a yonge Bullocke, or 
Steere, in such respectes as these where 
the difference is so small, it skilleth not 
greatly, if they whiche be somwhat hard 
[^f.F3v^] 
to digest, be eaten before other of so~what 
lighter digestion. This (vnlesse I be 
much deceaued) was the opion of Galen, 
and not without good consideracion. For 
heauie meates and such as be of slow digestion, 
require a stronger and greater 
power digestiue. And all men (without 
exception) doo confesse and know that the 
lower part of the Stomacke or Maw in 
the act of concoction is stronger then the 
vpper and middle parte is. Therefore 
meates of easie digestion ought to be taken 
before those, which doo differ so farre 
from them in easinesse of concoction as 
the power of the lowest parte of the ventricle 
differeth from the first and middle: 
which difference ought to be referred to 
the discretion and iudgement of the skilfull 
Phisicion. Thus may the flesh of a 
Bullocke be eaten before the flesh of a 
bigge calfe, and the flesh of a suckinge kid 
or younge tender calfe after veale of a calf 
of bigger growthe: thus also may yonge 
Pigeons, Hennes, and Capons be well 
eaten before Partriches and Chickens. 
Neither needeth a man to feare least thei 
[^f.F4r^] 
should be corrupted in his stomacke, because 
they are not easely corruptible, and 
also because there seemeth to be such proporcion 
of digestion in a maner between 
these meates for facilitie or difficultie of 
concoction, as is between the vpper and 
the lowest part of the ventricle, and therfore 
they may at one and the same time 
be concocted in the stomack, because meates 
of hard digestion are sent to y=e= lower 
and stronger parte, and they of lighter digestion 
to the weaker. 
And also this must not be omitted, that 
we must altogether abstaine from crude 
and rawe meates, and take heede that al 
our Cates be cleanlie dressed, well seasoned 
and throughlie boyled or els rosted. 
But in any wise we must beware y~ we 
do not infarce & pamper our selues with 
to muche, and that we do not irrite our 
Stomack and prouoke an appetite with 
fine Iunkets and delicious Sauces. For 
meate excessiuelie ingurgitate and eaten 
althoughe it be of good iuyce and nourishemint 
[/23./] 
commonly engendreth and 
breedeth cruditie, laskes and vomit. Againe, 
[^f.F4v^] 
lesse then necessitie and nature requireth, 
is the cause why the bodie is not 
nourished, but weakened and enfeebled, 
and made vnhable to do his busines as it 
[/24./] 
did befeore, because the bodie is emptie 
and not able to distribute sufficient and 
conuenable nourishement to the spirite. 
[/25./] 
For euen as Repletion hindereth nourishment 
and rebuketh nature and the 
poore Animall: to all maner of abstinence 
causeth vomites, hurteth the ventricle, 
resolueth the powers of the bodie 
and encreaseth ill humours. And euen as 
an ill diet bringeth heauines and drowsie 
lumpishenes to the bodie and a dulnes 
to the wit and senses: so a conuenient 
and orderlie diet quickeneth the spirites 
and reuiueth the minde, making it more 
actiue and couragious to know and practi3e 
vertuous operations. 
 
[}Of Bread.}] 
 
NOw let vs particularlie declare the 
seueral kindes of meate and drink, 
[^f.G1r^] 
and first let vs begin with bread, whiche 
(as Nouius affirmeth) is called in latine 
Panis, a Pascendo, of feedinge. The best 
[/26./] 
Breade is made of fine wheate flower 
cleane boulted from all branne and other 
baggage, which grew on holesome grou~d 
sufficie~tly leauened, moderately seasoned 
with Salte, well moulded and throughlie 
baked, but not burned in the ouen. 
Auenzoar would that bread shoulde be 
eate~ the same day y=t= it is made whe~ it is 
colde, which then (as he thinketh) greatlie 
conserueth health, and after it be a 
day olde, he saieth it should not be eaten, 
because it hath lost his tymperatenes of 
complexion and the more it is hardened, 
the heauier is it to be concocted. Auicen 
his opinion is, that bread ought not to be 
eaten before it haue stoode one night, and 
as for hoate bread he vtterlie discomme~deth 
it, saying that it ought to be eschewed, 
because it is not (as he there affirmeth) 
receptible of nature, and also by 
reason of his warmenes causeth thirste, 
and by reason of his vaporous moysture 
swymmeth in the Stomacke, and is 
[^f.G1v^] 
longe ere it passe and descend into the entrailes. 
It doth also send an vnnaturall 
heate into the stomacke or ventricle, 
whereby it is checked, maistered and 
damnified. Therefore hoate bread must 
be eschewed, and also in sommer when 
it is aboue two dayes olde, and in winter 
after three daies age, it ought to be forborne. 
And we must be very circumspect 
in the fanning and making cleane of such 
graine and seedes as wee shall afterward 
eate. For of this let vs be well assured, 
[/27./] 
that although, we do not presentlie feele 
the dailie harme that by little and little 
encreaseth (vnperceaued of vs for awhile 
because of the smalenes thereof, yet notwithstandinge 
in continuance of time, it 
bringeth much inconueniences and disquietnes. 
And at length bursteth out to 
our great paine. Hauing spoken of bread 
which Homer termeth the pithe and marow 
of man and the sacred Scriptures 
affirme to corborate mans hart, and nature, 
let vs now likewise make the like 
discourse of wine, which of the same Authour 
is called the Strength of man and 
[^f.G2r^] 
in holie writte is sayed to cheere vp the 
minde and make the hart mery. 
 
[}Of VVine.}] 
 
WYne hath great vertue and sundrie 
[/28./] 
singuler effectes come by drinking 
thereof, as not onelie Aristotle & Galen 
but other phisicions of later daies haue 
noted and namelie the absolute and learned 
man Andrew Matheolus Senensis, 
[/29./] 
out of whose worke I do not excerpe and 
alledge any thing, least I should vainely 
seeme to make a Commentarie out of 
Commentaries, and like a vaine glorious 
person seeke to trimme vp my self 
with other birdes feathers, speacially sith 
his Bokes are to all persons and in all 
places to be had. And brieflie to declare 
my opinion, I say that wine moderately 
dronken clarifieth the Spirit & maketh 
[/30./] 
it lustie, and lightsome and of competent 
substance, it nourisheth and comforteth 
it, and greatlie refresheth the minde, 
wherfore not without good reason it is 
[^f.G2v^] 
endued with great power and singuler 
vertue to letifie and conserue nature. 
But being immoderatelie dronken and 
[/31./] 
ingluuiouslie swilled (as now adaies many 
vse to do) it is most hurtfull and the 
special cause of many greeuous diseases. 
For it endamageth and hurteth y=e= braine 
and all the sinewes & senses, and doth too 
much humect and moysture the whole 
bodie. Therfore it must be temperately 
dronken and good regarde had that it be 
of the best kinde, growinge in the best 
soyle, & here I will reken vp some kinds 
of the best, for all I neither can declare 
neyther will the breuitie of this small 
compendie permitte. 
 
That wine is best, whiche is neither 
to olde nor to new, but meane between 
bothe, well fined and cleare, reddish or 
of a citron couler, pleasant in tast and of 
a sweete smell, of suche relish (I say) as 
in tast seemeth neither to be very tarte 
and sharpe, nor yet very doulcet & sweet. 
For thynges sharpe and pontique, yea 
and sweete also do quickly cause obstructions: 
the one because they bynde, the other 
[^p..f.G3r^] 
because they passe into the veines 
and members vnconcocted, of which sort 
sweete wine is one of the chiefest. In so 
muche that Auerrois (althoughe he be a 
man not of the greatest aucthoritie in 
phisicke) affirmeth wine to be drawen of 
the Liuer vndigested euen assoone as it is 
dronken. But the drinkinge of white 
[/32./] 
wine being subtile and cleare and speciallie 
in sommer time, as it doth vnto other 
famous and expert doctours in phisicke 
so also vnto me doth it seeme verie 
good and commendable. For this is it, 
that Galen the prince of phisicions by actuall 
trial and experiment (yea Auerrois 
saieth the same also) affirmeth that he 
found in diuerse places of Italie, wherin 
was to be found neither sowernes, ponticitie, 
stipticitie, bitternes nor Sweetenes, 
which also engendred no inflacions 
and fumosities, and this wine onelie is 
without all such daungers and inconueniences 
as commonlie happen & chaunce 
after the drinkinge of other wines or of 
water. And therfore this wine is moste 
agreeable and fitte for stronge and mature 
[^f.G3v^] 
age or the age of consistencie, and 
for hoate complexions and namelye in 
Sommer for many causes, but chieflie 
because it causeth no headache but rather 
driueth it and taketh it awaye if it come 
throughe heate of the stomacke. Neere 
vnto it in goodnes is an other wine 
which in the olde time was named Ablutum, 
and in Italie (speciallie in Lumbardie) 
[/33./] 
it is commonlye termed by the 
name of Auicen his wine. And in this 
maner is it made, Take three partes of 
Muste and one parte of water, boyle the~ 
together till the fowerth part be wasted. 
Other some vse, when the Grapes be 
troden and the iuyce wringed out, to put 
water to it, in proporcio~ according to the 
strength and power of the wine, and the~ 
after a fewe dayes to put it in vesselles. 
But when the season of the yere is somwhat 
colde: or when the temperature of 
the bodie by reson of age or otherwise is 
faint and weake, Claret and Citron couloured 
wine (if no impediment and cause 
to the contrarie) is best and to be preferred 
before any other. 
[^f.G4r^] 
Whiche if it be endued with any fumositie, 
[/34./] 
the same may be qualefied and alayed 
with water least it stuffe the head, 
and cause thirst. Yet may it not be to 
much alayed and made thinne, for then 
doth it debilitate and weaken the stomacke, 
causing many fumosities in the 
same: but beyng moderately alayed and 
tempered it is muche praysed of Galen, 
because it qualefieth humours, exciteth 
and stirreth vp naturall heate and without 
harme pearceth the membres. 
Certes euery one of these kinds of wine 
are greatly avayleable to them that therwith 
be acquainted and accustomed. 
For it strengthneth vertue, expelleth 
Choler and Melancholy by prouokynge 
of vrine, quickly ripeth the good iuice and 
humours wherewith the body is humected, 
and maketh the ill humours to descend 
from the vpper partes to the lower, 
whereby the head is eased and holpen. 
But in drinkynge of Wine, there must 
be no lesse consideration had of the countreys, 
times and exercises, then of the 
affections, appetites and complexions of 
[^f.G4v^] 
men, that wee maye conserue them oderate 
with that y~ is agreeable therto, & amende 
the immoderate by their contraries. 
Therefore (as before I haue noted) 
to colde and drie complexions, the 
claret and sweet Wine (because it is verie 
hoate) is best, and the contrarie serueth 
best for hoate temperatures. Furthermore 
[/35./] 
those wines are to be forborne 
whiche be either very olde or very new: 
because the one heateth vnmeasurably, 
and the other neuer a whit, so longe as 
thei be new, which not onely helpeth nothing 
to digest the meate, but is it selfe 
rather very slowly and with much a doe 
decocted. Now, I thinke I neede not to 
counsell men to refrayne drinkynge of 
[/36./] 
Wyne when they be fastyng, or before 
they haue eaten so~what, because I write 
to such men as be sobre and modest and 
not to tossepottes and drunkards. For 
beyng drunken at any suche times, commonlye 
bryngeth many inconueniences 
and diseases proceedyng of Fleame, and 
namely the Apoplexie in suche case is 
much to be feared. After meales also to 
[^f.H1r^] 
drinke much is hurtefull, because it maketh 
[/37./] 
the meate in y=e= stomacke, to descend 
before it be sufficie~tly boiled & concocted. 
For while y=e= meate is in digesting in the 
stomack, we ought to refrain much drinking. 
But after y=t= the meate is descended 
fro~ the mouth of =e=Stomack & is sufficientlie 
concocted Auicen permitteth large 
and great drincking, to washe and mundefie 
the stomacke and to make the meat 
the better to pearce and be diffused into 
the veines: But till suche time, he lessoneth 
[/38./] 
vs to abstaine vnlesse great occasion 
of thirste otherwise require. And to 
quenche a drye thirste, it shall suffice eyther 
to drinke a litle at once, or in the 
Sommer time rather to rinse and wash 
your mouth w~ cold water. And it is very 
good to haue Pomgranards in store being 
of a middle relice, for they are good to 
eate, when throughe drinkinge of wine 
there is any vpbraidinge and mordicatio~ 
in the stomacke. Also to drinke after such 
meat as encreaseth ill humour (of which 
sort are Musheromes) Auicen vtterlie 
forbiddeth: semblably after such fruictes, 
[^f.H1v^] 
as Melons, Pompons, yealow Quinces 
and suche like. For wyne being dronke 
after suche fruictes, enforceth them to 
perce to the veines, whereby their corrupt 
iuyce is mixed with the bloude, and 
so is cause of the corruption thereof. But 
men now a dayes do cleane contrarie, for 
they loue to drinke with these and suche 
like fruictes the best wine they can gette 
as a remedie (for so they say) of fruictes, 
yea and sometimes they haue the phisicions 
themselues compaignions with the~. 
But if thou wouldest keepe thy stomack 
from the harme that proceedeth by the 
coldnes and moystnes of these fruictes, it 
were a great deale better to vse to take 
Aniseede, or Cinnamome, or ginger, or 
Honie and suche like. 
 
Heere as it were in the way of an addicion 
to the declaration of Wyne, I wil 
speake a woord or twaine more, to teache 
you to know whether your Wine bee 
pure, or els mingled. It is sometimes 
seene (as now in many thinges there is 
muche legierdemayne and deceite vsed) 
[/39./] 
that Wyne is mingled with Hony, to 
[^f.H2r^] 
make it sweete and pleasant. If it be 
thus abused and mixed, it may be easely 
knowen by this meanes. Take a few 
droppes of it, and powre them vpon a 
hoate plate yron, and the Wyne if it be 
pure being resolued, because it is thinner 
and subtiler, the Hony wil remayne and 
thicken, because it is of a groser and thicker 
substance. If you suspect, that your 
Wine be mingled with water, you may 
easely know whether it be so or no by 
[/40./] 
putting a Peare into it: for if the Peare 
swim a lofte and descende not to the bottome, 
then is the wine pure & vnmingled, 
but if it sinke to the bottome, it is an 
infallible token that it is mingled with 
water. Many suche pretie conclusions 
might here be shewed, but these for this 
matter are sufficient. As concernyng the 
hower when to eate these aforesayde and 
such like fruictes shall hereafter be declared, 
but first wee will shew of such meates 
as nourish best. 
 
[}Of Fleash.}] 
 
[^f.H2v^] 
AFter Breade and Wyne (two of 
[/41./] 
the cheefest mainteiners of mans 
life) fleashe is next in order to be 
spoken of. For Auicen sayeth, that fleash 
is a meate comfortynge the body and of 
neere transubstantiation and conuersion 
into bloud, specially the fleash of those 
beastes and fowles that be of the best 
nourishyng sort. And the wise Sages of 
our profession, commend as moste profitable 
for the conseruacion of healthe, amonge 
foure footed Beastes, the Fleshe 
of younge Kiddes and suckyng Calues, 
whiche be so muche the better if they be 
nourished with wholesome milke and in 
good pastures. For this is to be noted y~ 
of al Beastes which be of sound complexion 
and qualitie, the youngest are most 
wholesome, as Kiddes, Calues and such 
like: but of them that be moyst, the youngest 
are most harmefull. And therefore 
Auicen sayth, that Lambes should be a 
yeere olde before they be eaten. Notwithstandyng 
in this poinct the disposicion 
and temperature of the Countrey 
must be respected wherevpon Auicen 
[^f.H3r^] 
sayde that in the East and South partes 
of the world, Lambe and Mutten might 
without daunger be eaten, whiche in our 
moyst Countrey, and in moyst bodies is 
not alway expedient. Seldome therefore 
[/42./] 
and warelie must Lambe be eaten, 
and rather in the sommer and Autumne 
then at any other time of the yeere, because 
drinesse then beareth sway. And if 
wee eate therof in the Winter or in the 
beginning of the Springe, it were much 
better rosted then boyled. Younge 
Beeif bred vp in wholesome pasture and 
[/43./] 
well exercised and chased, is in the winter 
and Spryng not to be misliked, for 
then Uentres be moste hoate of nature, 
and sleape very longe as Hippocrates 
affyrmeth, and therefore they may the 
better digest heauie meates: but in sommer 
and Autumne, meates of light digestion 
must be vsed, because the internall 
and naturall heate is then weaker 
by reason of the heate of the Ayre. As 
for grosse meates that are drie and harde 
as cowes Beeif and suche like I vtterly 
disalow: because beside many other 
[/44./] 
[^f.H3v^] 
harmes that it bringeth by reason of the 
hardnesse of it, and difficultie to be digested, 
this namely is one, that it inferreth 
harme to the reasonable parte of man 
whiche is the minde. Porke or Hogges 
flesh nourisheth very much, and is pleasant 
and toothsome in taste, but if they be 
very younge, there fleash is too moyste 
and heauie of digestion, and therefore we 
must leaue it to ploughmen and labourers 
of stronger Stomackes. But being 
of middle age, as from sixe monthes to a 
yeere olde (if they be not to fatte) theyr 
fleash is restoratiue to them that neede 
meates of such operation & haue stronge 
Stomackes: for no kinde of flesh (saieth 
Galen) more nourisheth the body then it 
doth. The flesh of wild hogges are much 
commended, for by reason of their exercise 
and drye feedinge they are not greatlie 
moyste but in a manner temperate. 
The fleshe of an Hare is not good to bee 
[/45./] 
eaten often, but it is best about the beginninge 
of the springe or winter because of 
y=e= drinesse of it, for it maketh grosse bloud 
and melancholique humoure. But the 
[^f.H4r^] 
braine is good for them that haue verie 
moiste braines and tender softe bodies. 
 
Of fethered fowles there be manye 
sortes: wherof Hennes and Capons are 
holesomest in winter and in the beginninge 
of the springe, and Chickens in 
Sommer, and Autumne because they 
encrease good bloude and humours, and 
qualefie those that are ill. In this season 
[/46./] 
also Quailes, phesantes and young Partriches 
are excellent, for they be of a good 
concoction, nourishe singularlie well, and 
causeth few or no superfluities: and also 
they helpe the stomacke and binde the 
mouth thereof. I meane them that be 
young because they are more temperate 
then the elder. Auicen sayeth that the eatinge 
of Quailes is to be feared, leaste 
therby be engendred the crampe and the 
disease called Tetanus (whiche is a stiffenes 
and incensibilitie in the sinewes) not 
onely because they feede on the herb Elleborus 
(which of it selfe is venemous) and 
be therwith nourished, but also because 
the same perillous infection is in their 
fleshe. Notwithstanding this their venenositie 
[^f.H4v^] 
attributed to them by Auicen, 
and auowched by Galen, Lucretius and 
Plinie, I woulde not willinglie refuse 
them for sustentation, neither woulde I 
feare a whitte the incurring of any the aforenamed 
disease. For those kinde of 
Quailes that they wrate of, differ & are 
not the same that the Quailes here in 
this countrey are. The difference betweene 
whome and the other, is largelie 
set forth and described by Alexander 
Mundella in his sixt Epistle. 
 
As for sparrowes because they be exceeding 
[/47./] 
hoate and drie my counsaile is to 
be forborne and because they stir vp Venus 
merueilouslie, they are fittest to be 
left for olde men that haue you~ge wiues. 
Culuers and home doues are a litle heauie 
in concoction, specialie the you~ge Pigeons 
that are not yet flidge and cannot 
flie, because they haue in them superfluous 
humours. But when they be able to 
flie, they are excellent good meate and 
holesome, making good humour and are 
lightly digested. Wood Culuers because 
they bestirre and exercise themselues 
[^f.I1r^] 
more then the domesticall dooues do, are 
lighter of digestion. Auicen thinketh 
them best to be eaten in Sommer (I 
thinke for their moystnes) for els if they 
be eaten at any other season he apointeth 
the iuyce of a sower grape called Acresla 
& Coriandre to be eaten withall, to remooue 
and take awaye the heate that is 
in them. But I am of a contrarie opinion, 
for I thinke it is muche better to eate 
them in Autumne whiche is colde and 
drye and likewise in winter and beginninge 
of the Springe, and Northernly 
seasons, whose moysture is a good deale 
taken away in the rosting. But Turtles 
are farre better because the haue lesse 
[/48./] 
moysture, albeit many thinke that they 
be of a drye complexion, and yet not to 
[/49./] 
hoate: yea they haue a singuler vertue to 
comfort the braine and sharpen the wit, 
and may safelie be eaten in the later end 
of Autumne and in winter. The flesh of 
bigge water fowles are not very holesome, 
[/50./] 
because they make ill and blacke 
humour. The flesh of a ducke aswell the 
[/51./] 
wilde as the tame nourisheth very well 
[^f.I1v^] 
but it is heauie to digest. Therfore it is 
better for Labouringe men and stronge 
stomackes then for quasie and weake 
bodies. The winges of fowles do nourishe 
commendablie, because they be wel 
[/52./] 
exercised and easier to digest, retaynyng 
very few superfluities by reason of their 
frequent motion. The fleash that is about 
the bones is sweeter and better to 
digest then other: so is also the Fleash 
[/53./] 
of the right side. Loose and spoongie flesh 
as the Udders and the rootes of tongues 
is toothsome in taste, but slow of digestio~ 
but beeynge concocted, sometime they 
make phelgmatike nourishment, yet 
commonlie none but good. Marow and 
[/54./] 
the braynes are (as Auicen sayth) hurtfull 
to the stomacke. Also flesh that is fat 
is easely conuerted into Choler mixed 
with phelgme, and ill vapours. And 
therefore fattinesse in meate maketh verie 
small and the same ill nourishment, 
[/55./] 
and puffeth vp the meate in the bealy, 
Which made Auicen to thinke that verie 
litle of it, should be mingled with other 
flesh euen accordynge to that measure 
[^f.I2r^] 
that best agreeth to euerie mans delight. 
Also euery kinde of fleshe is commended 
[/56./] 
or discommended accordinge as 
it is in qualitie: for the more that the 
fleshe of Beastes doth degenerate from 
whytenes, the lesse good iuyce is therein 
it. And by all mens confession this is 
true, that of those beastes which be of one 
kinde, so longe as they be young and tender 
the make moyste nourishement: beynge 
in their middle or consistent age, 
their nourishement is hoater and dryer. 
But when they be olde, their fleshe is 
worst of all, because it encreaseth melancholique 
and excrementall humour, yea 
and the bigger bodied the worse. 
 
Wylde beastes and they that liue abroade 
in the fieldes, are hoater and drier 
then homishe and domesticall. All which 
(notwithstandinge) beynge vsed and taken 
at conuenient times and in due order 
that is to say accordinge as the qualitie 
of their temperature requireth, are 
thought nothinge at all to imbecile and 
hinder health. Salte meates meates (althoughe 
[/57./] 
they were moyste before) do retaine 
[^f.I2v^] 
a vehement power to drye and 
heate and geeue ill nourishement: and to 
be shorte, all maner of salte meate generally 
engendreth putrefiynge and rotten 
menlancholique bloude, and greatlie offendeth 
the lieuer. Therefore it must be 
seldome eaten and in moyst times of the 
yere, to witte in winter. Furthermore 
this sayinge of Auicen may not be pretermitted, 
that the fleshe of any blacke 
coloured beast and also of the male, is 
plesaunter and lighter then of others. 
And I haue thought good here also to recite 
the opinion of the expert man Auenzoar, 
who writeth that it is best to eate 
fleshe immediately or not longe after it 
is killed. And if they be somewhat harde 
(as the fleshe of wylde duckes and olde 
Turtles is) he thinketh it best, to haue 
them boyled in water within twelue 
howers after thei be killed, and in Sommer 
within seuen, of the whiche opinion 
Galen is also, which is in deede not to be 
[/58./] 
misliked, but both to be praised and followed. 
For the ayre doth alter them, wher 
by they are made apte to putrefaction, 
[^f.I3r^] 
when they remaine longe after their killinge, 
especiallie in a hoate & moist ayre. 
And this is verified & plainly to be seene 
in fishes, which (doubtles) are much better 
if they be dressed and eaten immediatelie 
after they be taken out of the water: 
and I am not ignorant that by reason 
of their watrish moystnes they wyll 
quicklie putrefie. And fleshe is better 
hoate then colde, speciallie in winter and 
Autumne: except kiddes fleshe whiche 
Auicen supposeth to be better and holesomer 
[/59./] 
when it is colde, because it then 
yeldeth no vapoure, but Lambe (he sayeth) 
is better when it is hoat. If the flesh 
be somewhat fatte, tender and verye 
moyst, it is best to roste it and speciallie 
in winter and the Springe, but otherwise 
it is best to boyle it, namely in So~mer 
and Autumne, because thereby they 
are of lighter concoction and keepe away 
siccitie or drynesse which at those times 
chieflie reigneth in mans body. Of rosted 
[/60./] 
fleshe the inner parte (because better 
moysture is gathered inwardlie) is better 
to be eaten then the vtter part. The 
[^f.I3v^] 
Spittes or broches beinge of Iuniper, 
[/61./] 
maketh al the meate to haue a pleasaunt 
and delightfull sauoure. Rosted fleshe is 
then best to be vnspitted and taken from 
the broche when it smelleth sweetest. 
For smellinge is the discouerer and token 
teller of tast. Thus muche of fleshe. 
 
Now wee speake somwhat of other 
sortes of nourishment, amonge whom 
[/62./] 
wee do affirme the Egges of a Henne, 
Partriche and Phesant to excell any other. 
Dioscorides commendeth them being 
halfe rosted that is to say meane betweene 
rere and hard, so that they may 
be supped, because they be then easely digested 
and increase good bloud. Auicen 
reckeneth them amonge soueraigne and 
cordiall meates, affirmyng the yolke to 
be of a laudable temperature: albeit he 
sayth in his second Canon, that the yolke 
inclineth to heate, and the white to coldenes, 
but the whole to be temperate. 
Serapio thinketh it to be more colde then 
hoate and not without good reason: for 
the whight of the egge is more colde then 
the yolke is hoate, because the yolke is 
[^f.I4r^] 
thought to be temperate or very neere to 
temperatenes. Egges wooulde be eaten 
before other meates because they are 
quicklie digested and soone descend from 
the mouth of the Stomacke, and nourish 
very quickly. For they haue all the proprieties 
that belongeth to good nourishment, 
& are soone transmuted into bloud, 
and leaue small superfluities: finallye 
they make subtile and cleare bloud wher 
by the principall member is nourished. 
For it goeth to the very hart, and for the 
dissolution of the substance of the spirite 
and cordiall matter it is a present remedie. 
Beyng harde rosted, they be of ill 
[/63./] 
nourishment, heauie to digest, causinge 
stinking fumes in the stomacke, and makyng 
the lower part of the belly stiptick, 
but poched, they do asswage and lenifie 
it. Wherefore Galen hath these wordes 
aboute the beginninge of his booke De 
Euchym. & Cacochym. Cockels (saith 
he) are accompted to be of a grosse iuice, 
and so are Egges, whiche are either sodden 
or rosted harde. If they be fried, they 
make il iuice and cause fumes in the stomacke 
[^f.I4v^] 
ere they be decocted, and do also 
corrupt other meates with whom they 
be mingled. But beynge measurably 
sodden and vsed, that is to wit somwhat 
rere, they are apt to digest, nourish, and 
encrease good bloud: so also are poched 
Egges good to asswage sorenesse & roughnesse 
of the throate. In milke and egges 
there is great abundance of fat and clammie 
moisture, the one appropriate to aliment 
and nouriture, the other to Sperm 
or seede of generation. The Egges or 
Spaune of fishes are nothyng so calefactiue 
and nutritiue: for so far as the flesh 
of Birdes is better then fishe, so muche 
are the egges: of fishes inferiour in goodnes 
to the egges of birdes Auicen alloweth 
the eatinge of Mylke in rype and 
[/64./] 
consistent age better then in adolescencie 
and therefore he thinketh it good for collerique 
persons, but ill for them that are 
phlegmaticke. Albeit he also sayeth that 
it is not good for th' entrayles, nor for the 
stomacke, and also causeth dimnesse of 
sight, hurteth the teeth, annoyeth the sinew, 
engendreth obstructions in y=e= Mefaraike 
[^f.K1r^] 
Ueines is soone corrupted, quickly 
sowreth and causeth headache. 
Wherefore that all these discommodities 
may be eschued, he woulde that it 
should be dronke alone, and after it is 
dronke to rest from labour, and then to 
sleepe and to eate nothynge vntill it be 
descended from the stomacke. But cheifly 
he warneth that in no wise vineigre, 
or sower meates be eaten after it. Yet 
do I counsell them that eate it, for feare 
least it should congele in their stomacks 
to put a litle suger or Salt, or pure hony 
vnto it, and to stirre it all together.
