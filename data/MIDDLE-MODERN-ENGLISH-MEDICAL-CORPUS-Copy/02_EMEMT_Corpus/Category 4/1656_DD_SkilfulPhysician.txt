[^f.A4r^] 
[}The DIRECTIONS for the 
Preservation of HEALTH.}] 
 
[}1. Of DIET.}] 
 
1. OPpresse not your stomack 
with immoderate 
or unseasonable 
eating or drinking. 
If you be in 
Health, do not eat or drink unlesse 
you have an appetite to it, and bee 
sure that you have an empty stomack 
before you eat, and to eat to 
fulness and overcharging of the stomack 
is not good. It is better to 
rise from Table with an appetite to 
eat more, then to sit down to Table 
without an appetite. 
 
2. Judg those meats most agreeable 
[^f.A4v^] 
to your body, which you desire 
most, and digest best, without any 
trouble to you; but eschue those 
meats hurtful to you, which you 
have eaten upon an empty stomack 
being in health, if after the eating of 
them, they cause soure and ill savoring 
belchings, with heaviness in 
your stomack. 
 
3. Observe this order in eating, if 
you have several dishes before you, 
first eat that which is of easiest digestion, 
and then eat that which is of 
harder digestion. 
 
4. If any do change their course 
of Dyet which they have used for a 
long time, as they who by high feeding 
and continual fulness, come to 
have a very fat and gross body, they 
resolve to use a more sparing Diet; 
or they who have been accustomed 
to a very sparing and low Diet, if 
on a sudden they come to have fulnesse 
and variety of Dyet; or they 
who have much used any thing, as 
[^f.A5r^] 
Tobacco, &c, which they resolve 
to forbear, let them observe these 
following Cautions: 1. Not to do 
it suddenly, but by little and little, 
for all sudden changes are hurtful to 
nature. 2. That they do it not, but 
in time of perfect health, because 
they are then best able to undergo 
such change. 3 That they do it not 
when they are much disturbed with 
businesse or otherwise; because when 
the mind is much disturbed, Nature 
is easily drawn to irregulate working 
to cause Diseases, and especially by 
a sudden change from that which 
hath been accustomed. 4. If a man 
hath accustomed himselfe to any 
thing the most part of his life time, 
howbeit this custome is bad, yet he 
cannot safely begin a change in his 
old age. 
 
5. Fasting from meat and drink in 
some cases is good, as in the increasing 
of acute Diseases, or if there be 
much crudity in the stomack; but 
[^f.A5v^] 
fasting unadvisedly used is hurtful; 
as to those who have melancholick 
or cholerick dry bodies, much fasting 
is very injurious; but to those who 
are phlegmatick, plethorick, fat, full 
of moist humours, temperance in 
their Diet, with often and seasonable 
fasting is very good. Likewise those 
who drink much as to be distempered 
thereby, if they eat before that 
drink be well digested, they undoubtedly 
wrong their bodies: and howbeit 
they are not then sensible of it, 
having a strong Constitution; yet 
certainly this will be a foundation of 
the decaying of nature. Extraordinary 
drinking doth very much dimihish 
the strength of Nature; and 
much more, if you add eating to excessive 
drinking. Experience maketh 
it appear to us daily in many, that 
excessive drinking or eating doth oppresse 
Nature, and causeth the decay 
of Nature even in the strongest constitutions. 
This is certain, that excessive 
[^f.A6r^] 
fulnesse, or too great want of 
what we should have, or any thing 
else which is not according to the 
course of Nature, is hurtful. 
 
6. Some use only one meal in a 
day, which is not to be commended, 
unlesse their digestive faculty be 
very weak and slow in its operation. 
Some use two meals in a day, others 
take three meals in a day, the which 
custome, as it is most generally received, 
so indeed it is most toe be approved 
of, if it be done with Discretion; 
viz. if you take such things as 
are most agreeable to you, and so 
much at a meal as may be easily digested 
before the next meal. It is a 
good rule of Diet, to eat often and 
little at a time, not to let the stomack 
be long empty, nor to eat again before 
it be empty; for to eat or drink 
(when we have meat in our stomack 
half digested, or almost digested) 
before the digestion be finished, it 
doth much disturb the digestive faculty, 
[^f.A6v^] 
pervert its operation, and so is 
the cause of many Diseases: but to 
keep the stomack alwayes in working, 
and to give it that whereupon 
it can work most easily, and to give 
it so much work as it can quickly performe: 
this doth encourage Nature 
to follow its work, it strengtheneth 
the digestive faculty, and preserveth 
it in its strength. By this rule, every 
one may order their own Diet well, 
if they rightly consider their strength 
and constitution, and condition of 
life. As those who stir much may 
feed oftner then they who use a sitting 
life; and those who have hot, 
cholerick, slender bodies, may feed 
oftner then those who have gross, fat 
or phlegmatick bodies. For they who 
have gross and ful bodies ought to 
use a sparing Diet, & to use such meats 
and drinks which are of little nourishment 
and of a drying faculty. But 
if you would know what time of the 
day you may feed most largely, I 
[^f.A7r^] 
answer, In the forenoon or in the 
morning, if you purpose to sup at 
night, that it may be well digested 
before supper time; for they who 
dine largely at noon, it is not probable 
that their dinner can be wel digested 
before Supper time, unlesse 
they be of a cholerick, hot constitution, 
for such have a quick digestion, 
and cannot eat much at a time. Now 
whereas many put the question, whether 
it is better to sup largely or dine 
largely: or if it be better to dine largely, 
and not to sup at all, whereas 
the common custome is to dine 
largely, and to use a light supper. I 
answer, If your stomack be not empty, 
if that which you have eaten before 
be not well digested, it is better 
not to sup at all, for the reasons already 
mentioned: but if your stomack 
be empty, and you have a good appetite 
to your supper, you may sup 
as largely as you may dine, so as you 
refrain from going to bed three or 
four hours after. 
 
[^f.A7v^] 
7. To eat of one sort of meat only 
at a meal, is best; but if you eat of 
several dishes, let them be such, as 
are neer of a Nature: for to eat of several 
dishes of disagreeing Natures, 
as to eat fish and flesh at the same 
meal, &c. it overthroweth the digestive 
faculty, filleth the body with 
discordant humours, and produceth 
strange bad Effects. 
 
8. To drink too sparingly at meals 
doth very much hinder concoction, 
to drink great draughts and seldom, 
doth weaken the stomack, which 
then is in concoction, and driveth 
down the meat too hastily, and corrupteth 
the whole body with overmuch 
moisture and crudity; wherefore 
it is best to drink often at meals 
and little at a time, and to swallow 
it down, not hastily, but leisurely; for 
the drink being mixt with the meats, 
by divers little draughts leisurely taken, 
tempereth them wel both for 
concoction and distribution. Ordinary 
[^f.a2r^] 
Beere is best at meals, and 
at the ending of your meal take 
some strong drink, viz. Wine 
or strong Beere to help concoction. 
Drink not betwixt meales, if you can 
possibly forbeare it, unlesse great 
thirst and drought of the stomack 
require it, and then only a little is to 
be taken. 
 
As for that custome commonly 
used, to drink fasting in the morning, 
it is not good for any but 
those who have a hot and dry constitution, 
or subject to obstructions, 
to allay the drought of the 
stomack, and to cleanse away slimy 
or obstructive humours, which are 
in the Stomack, Liver, Veines or 
Reines. 
 
9. It is a common custom and 
commendable, to set first on the 
Table bread and salt, and to take 
them last away, thereby shewing 
the necessary use of them at meals; 
and indeed they are to be reproved 
[^f.a2v^] 
who use not (as some do) bread 
or salt at their meals. For Salt 
helpeth concoction much, and preventeth 
the crudities of the stomack, 
and therefore it is good to 
eat much salt with fresh meats, ot 
to have your meats powdered. 
 
As for Bread, we may very well 
give it the first place at meales, 
for it yeildeth a nourishment very 
familiar to our Natures. Let your 
bread be the flower of the best 
Wheat, let it be fitly leavened: 
for so it is more easily digested, 
and yeildeth better nourishment; 
but if it be too much leavened, it 
is of heavy digestion, and of no 
commendable nourishment. Let it 
be temperately seasoned with salt, 
let it be light, well wrought, well 
baked, and eat it not over new, not 
too stale. When you eat flesh, eat 
twice so much bread as flesh. 
When you eat fish, eat thrice so 
much bread as fish, especially if 
[^f.a3r^] 
the fish be of the moister sort, that 
the superfluous moisture of it may 
be tempered by the driness of the 
bread; for they who eat little 
bread with their meats, commonly 
are troubled with windy crudities, 
watrish and impure stomacks. 
 
10. That you may know what 
kind of meats is best for you, take 
this general rule, use such meats as 
are most agreeable to the constitution 
of your body, to your age, and 
season of the year. Those who are 
of a hot cholerick constitution, 
should use meats of a moistning cooling 
nature. Those who are of a cold, 
dry, melancholick constitution, 
should use meats and drinks of a 
moistning and heating faculty. 
Those of a phlegmatick constitution, 
should use meats and drinks of 
a heating and drying faculty. Those 
of a sanguine complection, should 
[^f.a3v^] 
use a Diet of a temperate nature. 
And to those who have strong stomacks, 
meats of strong nourishment, 
and of slow concoction are 
most agreeable: but to them who 
have weak stomacks, as old or sickly 
people, &c. meats of lighter substance 
and of easier concoction are 
best. 
 
In respect of the season also, you 
must alter your Diet; in the Spring 
and Summer use a more sparing 
Diet then in Harvest or Winter. In 
the Summer use meats and drinks 
of a cooling and moistning faculty, 
in the winter let them be heating 
and drying; in the Spring let them 
be of a temperate nature, and not 
too nourishing; in the Harvest, let 
them be moistning, and moderately 
heating. 
 
I cannot here shew you particularly 
what things are cooling, or 
moistning, or heating, &c. because 
[^f.a4r^] 
I must be short being in a Preface, 
and I refer you to those who have 
treated largely of these things; viz. 
Muffets Improvements of Health. 
 
[}Of Sleep and Watching.}] 
 
Life cannot continue without 
food, and Health cannot be preserved 
without moderate sleep; for this 
refresheth the wearied spirits, and repaireth 
the decaued spirits, it furthereth 
concoction, and is a present 
help for Crudities; but if it be immoderately 
used, it is hurtful, it 
causeth defluxions, heaviness of 
the head, dulness of wit; cold 
phlegmatick Diseases, &c. therefore 
that you may use slep comfortably 
and profitably, have a care, 
that your sleep be seasonable, for 
as you should not watch when 
you should sleep, so you should 
[^f.a4v^] 
not sleep when you should be awake; 
and therefore eschue noon-sleeps, 
and too long morning-sleeps, 
as great enemies to health; 
for whatsoever is not according 
to the course of Nature, is contrary 
to Nature, and so will by little 
and little weaken Nature, and in 
the end overthrow it. Now we see 
it natural to all living and sensitive 
creatures to observe this rule, To 
sleep in the night time, and in the 
day to be provident to supply their 
wants; and therefore they who do 
contrary to this rule, are contrary 
to the course of nature, and wrong 
themselves, howbeit they are not at 
present sensible of it. And without 
doubt these two (which are 
both contrary to Natures rule) 
viz. unseasonable sleeping or watching, 
and unreasonable eating and 
drinking are the great causes which 
deprive us of Health, and shorten 
[^f.a5r^] 
our lives, as those especially who are 
rich find it by experience, who stay 
out of bed very late, and lye long 
in the morning, a bad custom: but 
as you tender health, sleep not in the 
mornings too long, unlesse honest 
occasions, or an ill disposition of 
body causeth much watching in 
the beginning of the night; then 
it is needful that you make amends 
by sleeping so much the longer 
in the morning: neither should 
you sleep at noone, for sleeping 
after dinner (if it is constantly used) 
causeth superfluous moisture of the 
braine, and causeth cold Diseases of 
the braine, as Palsies, &c. puffeth up 
the Spleene with wind, prepareth 
the body for Agues, Imposthumes, 
&c. 
 
Yet in some extraordinary cases 
sleeping after dinner may and ought 
to be used; 
 
1. If you have not slept 
[^f.a5v^] 
well in the night nor in the morning. 
 
2. If you be faint with excessive 
heat of the Season. 
 
3. Old people, because of their 
weaknesse, may sleep after dinner, 
or any other time when they 
can. 
 
4. Those who have slender and 
dry bodies, receive great benefit by 
sleeping after dinner; for it moistneth 
their bodies, and refresheth their 
spirits. But those who have full 
gross bodies, or who are of a sanguine 
or phlegmatick complexion, 
let them beware of sleeping after 
dinner. 
 
Now those who would sleep at 
noon must observe these things following. 
 
1. That they sleep not immediately 
after Dinner, but an hour 
after, or half an hour at least. 
 
2. That they sleep not lying, but 
[^f.a6r^] 
rather sitting with the body upright. 
 
3. That they sleep not over long, 
not above half an hour, or an hour at 
most. 
 
4. That they sleep not in a place 
too hot (especially in the Summer 
time) but rather enclining to cold: 
the most convenient place for any to 
sleep in at any time, is that which is 
not too hot nor too cold, not too 
close nor too open; and above all, 
it must not be dampish, for that is 
very hurtful to the body, especially 
to the head: you must have a care 
to keep your head and neck wel from 
the cold when you sleep. 
 
When you sleep, lye upon your 
right side; and not upon your left 
side, unlese it be to ease your body, 
when you are wearied with lying 
upon your right side: lye upon 
your left side as little as you can, 
for to lye upon the left side, hindreth 
[^f.a6v^] 
concoction, encreaseth the 
Diseases of the Spleene, causeth 
troublesome Dreames, &c. So 
likewise to lye upno your back when 
you sleep, is very unwholsome; it 
causeth troublesome sleeps, it causeth 
the Night-mare, it occasioneth 
the Lethargy, Palsies, Cramp, it 
heateth the Raines; it is very bad 
for those who are troubled with the 
Stone, or are inclined to it. 
 
Now if you would know how 
long you ought to sleep, observe 
this rule, That you should sleep, 
until you find the concoction of the 
stomack and liver be finished, the 
spirits well refreshed, and you find a 
lightsomnesse in the whole body, 
especially in the stomack and head. 
But if you find heavinesse in the body, 
head, and eyes, or stomack, or 
if you have ill favoured belchings, or 
&c. they signifie that you have not 
yet slept enough. 
 
[^f.a7r^] 
Again, the time of your sleep 
must be determined according to 
your strength and constitution; as 
those who are weak and sickly, or 
aged and children, must take longer 
time of rest, then those who are 
strong, or young, for whom seven 
or eight hours sleep is enough. And 
those who have dry, cholerick or 
melancholick bodies, need longer 
sleep then the phlegmatick or sanguine, 
or those who have grosse 
fat bodies; for it very much refresheth 
and moistneth dry bodies, to 
whom there is nothing more hurtful 
then too much watchfulnes. But 
too long sleep to phlegmatick, grosse 
bodies is very hurtful. 
 
It is a custome to warme the 
bed before we go to bed, which 
should not be used by those who 
are healthful and strong (unlesse 
fresh sheets be layed upon the bed) 
for it weakneth their bodies, and maketh 
[^f.a7v^] 
them tender. But it is good for 
them who are aged, or are weak 
by Nature, or lead a tender course 
of life, for such cannot well endure 
a cold bed, it may wrong 
them much: weak or tender Natures, 
are by very small occasions 
overcome and put out of their 
right courses. 
 
I conclude concerning sleeping 
and watching with this, That immoderate 
and unseasonable Sleeping 
weakeneth the natural heat, filleth 
the body with bad humours, and 
enclineth the body to cold, phlegmatick 
Diseases, dulleth the spirits and 
wit. 
 
And immoderate Watching dryeth 
the body too much, it turneth 
a sanguine constitution to be cholerick, 
and it turneth a phlegmatick 
constitution to be melancholick, 
it overdryeth the braine; it 
wasteth the spirits, it weakneth the 
[^f.a8r^] 
digestive faculty, enclineth the body 
to consumptions, &c. 
 
[}Of Exercise.}] 
 
The stirring of the body by walking, 
riding, some pastime, &c. If 
it be moderate and in fit time; it 
encreaseth natural heat, refresheth 
and quickneth the spirits, maketh 
the body lightsome and nimble, 
helpeth concoction, furthereth the 
expulsion of the Excrements and bad 
humours, &c. In any stirring industrious 
course of life, for the most part 
they live longer and healthier then 
those who use a sitting restful 
life. 
 
But you must have a care, that 
you use not too much stirring or 
motion of the body to weary your 
selfe too much; for this will consume 
the natural moisture, and waste 
[^f.a8v^] 
the spirits, encline the body to a Consumption, 
&c. 
 
Those who would use any kind of 
Exercise only for their Healths sake, 
let them not do it upon a full stomack, 
or immediately after eating, 
for the most part of Physicians do 
agree in this, that wee should not 
go about any exercise of the Body 
until the first and second digestion 
is compleated, when the stomack 
is light and almost empty. 
 
It will be good also to disburden 
your selves of the excrements 
of the belly, and of urine, 
before you begin your Exercise, 
lest the Excrements by the violence 
of the head of the Exercise, be drawn 
into the veines, or &c. whereby 
the blood may be orrupted, Obstructions 
caused, &c. And if you 
use any exercise or violent motion 
of the body immediately after 
meales, or while there is meat in 
[^f.a9r^] 
the stomack not digested, it marreth 
digestion, and causeth crudities 
and bad humours: whereupon will 
follow Scabs, Ulcers, Imposthumes. 
This is to be understood chiefly 
of those who use a restful life, and 
live tenderly. But those who live 
in continual exercise of their body, 
as labouring men, they need not be 
so cautious for the time or manner 
of their Exercise (for that to 
which our Natures are constantly 
accustomed, will not do us 
harme,) if men keep themselves 
to one constant course of Exercise, 
and not at any time to exceed 
their ordinary custome: but 
if they do things rashly and immoderately, 
otherwise then they 
use to do; as if they fall upon 
any work upon a full stomack; 
of if after violent hot working 
they are carelesse of themselves, 
and keep not themselves 
[^f.a9v^] 
warme, &c. Thereupon certainly 
will follow alterations of the body 
and Diseases. For that to 
which we are not accustomed, if 
it be violent and oppresseth Nature, 
it must of necessity work dangerous 
alterations in us. You must 
be very cautious in the doing of 
any thing to which you are not accustomed, 
until by constant use 
it beometh familiar to our Nature, 
and then it may be used safely, 
howbeit at first perhaps it was 
dangerous, if not used with great 
caution. 
 
A constant custome in any thing 
prevaileth much with Nature, so 
that a man may safely do that to 
which he hath been accustomed, 
which would be very dangerous to 
another. And therefore violent 
stirring of the body to those who 
have a restful life, or untimely exercise 
immediately after meales, is 
[^f.a10r^] 
hurtful; but to rise up after mael, to 
stand or to walk softly is good: 
and if it be in cold seasons of the year, 
let the place be temperate, not too 
hot nor too cold; if it be in the hot 
seasons of the year, walk in the open 
fields, nigh to some pleasant 
rivers after supper; but after dinner 
in some shadowed place, or 
some cool Arbour, &c. Observe 
this general rule concerning the 
place, after meals to stand or walk 
in, That it incline more to cold then 
to heat. For as the heat of Exercise 
imediately after meals, so the heat 
of a hot place by drawing our natural 
heat from the inward parts of 
the body to the outward, it marreth 
digestion, and filleth the body 
with crude humours, therefore 
after meals let your place be pleasant 
and moderately cool, your exercise 
gentle walking and pleasant discourse 
with merry companie; spend an 
[^f.a10v^] 
houre so, and thereby you shall 
find digestion furthered, your body 
much refreshed, natural heat and 
strength cherished and encreased. 
But when you use great motion 
of the body, as in travel, pastime, 
&c. do it moderately, so 
as you do not weary your selves 
too much, and oppresse the 
strength of nature: and in this moderate 
beneficial stirring of the body 
there may be several degrees observed, 
according to the constitution 
of the body, and season of the 
year. 
 
1. Those who have a grosse or 
phlegmatick body, should use 
much exercise, and should exercise 
themselves so, as thereby to provoke 
sweat; but they must have a care 
that they provoke not sweat immoderately, 
nor proceed to extreme 
wearinesse, for thereby the 
spirits and good humors of the body 
[^f.a11r^] 
will be too much wasted, and the fat 
of the raines melted. 
 
2. Those who have dry slender bodies, 
must use easie exercise: They 
must stirre their bodies no longer 
then the colour and flesh is 
sowhat ruddy, and the sweat begins 
to come out; too much motion 
of their bodies will bring them 
to a Consumption. 
 
Again your Exercise must bee 
according to the season of the 
yeare; for as the season is colder, 
so you may use stronger and 
more laborious exercises, and 
oftner: and as the season inclineth 
more to heat, so the exercise 
or motions of your body 
must be more moderate and 
calme. 
 
One thing I will add here, viz. 
Rubbing of the Body, which is 
much commended to us by all 
Physicians, and is found by the experience 
[^f.a11v^] 
of all who have used it, to 
be a thing very beneficial to the 
body, and it may well stand in 
stead of all other Exercises or motions 
of the body, to those who cannot 
have such Exercises, either because 
of their weaknesse, or &c. It 
stirreth up and encreaseth natural 
heat, it quickneth the blood, it 
strengthneth the parts, it drawes 
humours from the higher parts of 
the body to the lower parts, it 
concocteth crude humours, it 
strengthneth digestion, it draweth 
bad humours from the principal 
parts of the body; there is not any 
one thing which may be more commended 
then this, for the preservation 
of the strength of Nature. But 
as all other Exercises of the body, 
so rubbing of the body must be used 
with caution, viz. That those who 
have gross or phlegmatick bodies 
must rub over their bodies until 
[^f.a12r^] 
they provoke sweat; but those who 
have hot bodies, or dry slender bodies, 
they must rub their bodies 
until the fresh beginneth to swell, and 
groweth ruddish, and no longer. 
So likewise according to the Season, 
we must use rubbing more or 
lesse; as the season is colder, so must 
we use rubbing more, and less in hot 
seasons. 
 
The manner how it is to be done, 
is thus. Rub with your hands, or 
rather with a warme linnen cloth 
your shoulders, armes, breast, 
sides, thighes, Legs and feet; but 
the belly, stomack and back, especially 
neer to the reines must not be 
rubbed. If you can your selves do 
it, and not to have another to do it. 
it will be so a great deal better. You 
must do it when you lye downe at 
night, but then more gently; but 
in the morning before you rise do 
it more strongly; and when you 
[^f.a12v^] 
rise, have a care to keep your selves 
well from the cold. Begin your rubbing 
easily and softly, afterwards 
faster and harder; and while you are 
rubbing, lay a double cloth warmed 
to your stomack and belly. 
After you are risen, and have 
combed your head well backward, 
then rub your head and your neck 
with a warm linnen cloth, and (if it 
be a cold season) before the fire, 
remembring the Cautions concerning 
rubbing before mentioned. 
This rubbing of the Head and 
Neck, is especially to be commended 
to those who have moist 
heads, Students, and such as are 
troubled with Rhumes, Palsies, 
&c. 
 
[^f.b1r^] 
[}Of Excrements.}] 
 
1. To go to stool twice or once 
in the day at least, preventeth those 
many inconveniences which are caused 
by the too long stay of the Excrements 
in the body; but if you 
cannot do so by reason of costiveness, 
which is very hurtful, and hath 
many inconveniencies following it, 
therefore drink much, especially at 
meals, that thereby the stomack and 
intestines may be well moistned: 
this will keep the Excrements soft, 
and make the passages slippery. But 
if Nature is dull and slow to evacuation, 
it will be good to use some 
gentle loosening thing, at first once 
in two dayes for some time, then 
use it once in a day: and when you 
[^f.b1v^] 
have accustomed your self to go to 
stool so once in the day, Nature it 
selfe will afterwards observe that custome. 
 
2. Sweating is very good for 
gross phlegmatick Bodies; but 
those who have dry slender bodies, 
must use it very moderately; and 
those whose bodies are too much 
dryed by a Disease, or are enclining 
to a Consumption must exchew sweating 
as much as they can. 
 
3. Keep not Urine or Wind in 
your body, when Nature would 
void them, for they are very hurtful, 
if they be kept long in the body; 
and if you cannot break wind 
upward when it is in the stomack, ot 
break it downward when it is in the 
belly, then use something which is 
good against the wind: let it stay 
in you body as little time as you 
can, especially if it be bred (as 
most commonly it is) of Crudities; 
[^f.b2r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.b3.^] 
but when your body is free from 
Crudities, do not accustome your 
selfe to break wind, refraine from 
it then as much as you can; for if 
we bring Nature to a custome to 
break wind much, it is the way to 
make it breed wind. 
 
4. To use any thing to provoke 
the evacuation of phlegme at the 
mouth or nose, is not to be approved 
of; it is best to let Nature 
follow its own course, unlesse those 
Excrements of the mouth or nose be 
obstructed: or abound exceedingly 
by reason of a cold, or some other 
Cause. 
 
[^f.b2v^] 
[}Of Passions of the Mind.}] 
 
Eschew all excessive Passions, 
as excessive joy, excessive anger, 
excessive fear, &c. for they oftentimes 
cause weaknesse of the body, 
and Swounings, and oft times 
sicknesse, and sometimes sudden 
death. Likewise envy, extreme 
cares, continual fear and continual 
sadnesse, are great enemies to health 
and shorten life: but a quiet contented, 
cheerful mind, free from all 
these Passions, is a great supporter 
of Health and prolonger of 
Life. 
 
[^f.b3r^] 
[}Of the Choice of Aire.}] 
 
The best Aire is that which is 
pure, clear, and temperate, not 
too hot nor too cold, nor too moist, 
nor mixed with grosse moisture, 
or corrupt noisome vapours. Therefore 
shun that Aire which 
 
1. Evaporateth from corrupt 
Ponds, standing Pools, impure places, 
as nasty Ditches which are full 
of impurities, &c. 
 
2. Which is in Valleys or low places, 
which are shut up about with 
Hills, so as no wind can come to it to 
purifie it. 
 
3. Shun the Aire of Marish and 
moorish grounds. 
 
4. Shun foggy mists. 
 
5. Stay not in the night Aire; 
[^f.b3v^] 
nor in any moist or dampish Air, as a 
moist Easterly Air, or a moist Westerly 
Aire. 
 
An impure Aire which ariseth 
from corrupt impure places, infecteth 
the body, and causeth dangerous 
Diseases. 
 
An Aire which is too moist, 
or a Night aire encreaseth phlegm, 
and causeth Rheumes. 
 
The Aire of low and marish places, 
fill the body with gross phlegmatick 
humours, causeth paine in 
the joints, Cramp, Palsie, and 
other cold Diseases of the braine, 
&c. 
 
An Aire extreme cold (if we continue 
long in it) it weakeneth the 
brain and sinews, causeth Rheums 
and Coughs, weakneth natural 
heat; &c. 
 
An Aire too hot spends our spirits, 
weakneth concoction, dissolveth 
and draweth out natural 
[^f.b4r^] 
heat, it burneth the blood, &c. 
 
That Aire then is most wholsome 
which is temperate and clear; 
and therefore those dwellings are 
commended as the best, which are 
seated on high dry grounds in open 
Aire, far from low, marish or filthy 
places, for there the aire is most 
pure, subtile and temperate.
