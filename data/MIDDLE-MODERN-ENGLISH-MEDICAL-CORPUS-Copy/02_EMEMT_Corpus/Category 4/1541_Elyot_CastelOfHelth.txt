TO THE CONSERVATION 
of the body of mankynde, within 
the lymitation of helth (whiche as 
Galene saythe) is the state of the 
[/1./] 
body, wherin we be neyther greued 
with peyne, nor lette from doinge 
our necessary busynesse, doth belonge the dilygent 
consyderation of thre sortes of thynges, 
that is to say, 
Thynges Naturall, 
Thynges not naturall, and 
Thynges ageinst nature. 
 
Thinges Naturall be .vii. in number. 
[^Beginning of a list in two columns.^] 
Elementes. 
Complexions, 
Humours. 
[^A column change.^] 
Members. 
Powers. 
Operations and Spirites. 
[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
These be necessary to the beinge of helth, accordynge 
to the order of their kynde: and be alway 
in the naturall body. 
 
Thynges not naturall be syxe in number. 
[^Beginning of a list in two columns.^] 
Ayre. 
Meate and drinke. 
Slepe and watche. 
Meuinge and rest. 
[^A column change.^] 
Emptinesse and repletion, and 
Affections of the mynde. 
[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
Thynges ageinst Nature be thre. 
Syckenesse. 
Cause of syckenesse. 
Accident, whiche foloweth sickenes. 
 
[^f.1v^] 
Annexed to thynges naturall. 
Age. 
Colour. 
Fygure, and 
Dyuersitie of kindes. 
 
THE Elementes be those originall thinges 
vnmyxt and vncompounde, of whose tempera~ce 
and myxture all other thynges, hauynge corporall 
substaunce, be compacte: Of them be foure, 
that is to saye. 
[^Beginning of a list in two columns.^] 
Erthe. 
Water. 
[^A column change.^] 
Ayre and 
Fyre. 
[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
ERTHE, is the mooste grosse and ponderouse 
element, and of her proper nature is colde 
and drye. 
VVATER, is more subtyll and lyght thanne 
erthe, but in repecte of Ayre and Fyre, it is grosse 
and heuye, and of her proper Nature is colde 
and moiste. 
EYRE, is more lyghte and subtyll than the 
other two, and beinge not altered with any exteriour 
cause, is properly hote and moiste. 
FYRE, is absolutely lyght and cleare, and is 
the clarifier of other elementes, if they be vycyate 
or out of their naturall temperaunce, and is 
properly hote and drye. 
IT IS to be remembred, that none of the sayd 
elementes be co~monly sene or felt of mortal men, 
as they are in their originall being: but they, whithe 
by our senses be perceyued, be corupted with 
mutual mixture, and be rather erthy, watry, airy, 
and fyry, than absolutely erth, water, ayre, & fyre. 
 
[^f.2r^] 
[}Of the complexion of Man. Cap. 2.}] 
 
COMPLEXION is a combynation of two 
dyuers qualities of the foure elementes in 
one bodye, as hotte and drye of the Fyre: hotte 
and moyste of the Ayre, colde and moyste of the 
Water, colde and dry of the Erth. But although 
all these complexions be assembled in euery body 
of man and woman, yet the body taketh his denomination 
of those qualyties, whiche abounde 
in hym, more thanne in the other, as hereafter 
inseweth. 
 
The Bodye, where heate and moysture haue 
souerayntie, is called Sanguine, wherin the Ayre 
hath preeminence, and it is perceyued and knowen 
by these sygnes, whiche do folowe,

BEsydes the sayd complexions of all the hole 
bodye, there be in the partycular members, 
complexions, wherin if there be any distemperaunce, 
it bryngeth syckenesse or griefe in to the 
member. Wherfore to knowe the distemperature, 
these signes folowinge wold be considered. Forsene, 
that it be remembred, that some distemperatures 
be symple, and some be compounde. They

as longe as it is in good temperaunce, and therof 
is also two kyndes. 
Naturall and 
Unnaturall. 
 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
Choler naturall, 
	Naturall coler is the fome of bloud, 
	the color wherof is redde and clere, 
	or more lyke to an ore~ge colour, and 
	is hot and drye, wherin the fire hath 
	dominion, and is lyght and sharpe, 
	and is ingendred of the most subtyll 
	parte of matter decocte, or boyled in 
	the stomacke, whose beginninge is 
	in the lyuer. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
Unnaturall choler is that whiche is myxte or 
corrupted with other humours, wherof be foure 
kyndes. 
 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
Choler vnnaturall 
	Citrine or yelowe choler, which is of 
	the mixture of natural choler & watry 
	fleume, and therfore hath lesse heat 
	than pure choler. 
	Yelky, like to yelkes of egges, which 
	is of y=e= mixture of fleume congeled, 
	& choler natural, and is yet lasse hote 
	than the other. 
	Grene like to lekes, whose begi~ning 
	is rather of y=e= stomak, than of y=e= liuer. 
	Grene like to grene ca~ker of mettal, 
	& bourneth like venim, & is of exceding 
	adustio~ of choler or fleum: & by 
	these two ki~des nature is mortified. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
[^f.9v^] 
Melancoly or blacke choler is 
deuyded in to two kyndes. 
 
Naturall, whyche is the dregges of pure 
bloud, and is knowen by the blacknes, wha~ 
it issueth either downewarde or vpwarde, 
and is verily colde and drye, 
Unnaturalle, whyche procedeth of the adustion 
of colerik mixture, and is hotter and 
lighter, hauynge in it violence to kyll, with 
a daungerous disposition.

THYNGES not Naturall be soo called, by 
cause they be no portion of a naturall body, 
as they be which be called Naturall thinges: but 
yet by the temperance of them, the body beinge in 
healthe, is therin preseruyd. By the dystemperaunce 
[^f.14r^] 
of them, syckenesse is induced, and helth 
is dissolued. 
The fyrste of thinges not naturall is ayre, or 
breth which is properly of it selfe, or of some materiall 
cause or occasion, good or yll. 
That which is of it selfe good, hath pure vapours, 
and is of good sauour. 
Also it is of it selfe swifte in alteration, from 
hotte to colde, wherin the body is not moche prouoked 
to sweate for heate, ne to chylle for vehemency 
of colde. 
Ayre among al thinges not natural, is chiefly 
to be obserued, forasmoch as it dothe both inclose

[}THE SECONDE 
BOKE.}] 
 
[}Of Quantitie Ca. 1.}] 
 
THE Quantitie of meate muste be 
proporcioned after the substaunce 
and qualite therof, and accordinge 
to the complexion of hym that eateth. 
Fyrst, it ought to be remembred, 
that meates hote and moyste, 
whyche are qualyties of the bloudde, are soone 
tourned into bloudde, and therfore moche nouryssheth 
the body. Some meates do nourishe but 
lyttell, hauynge lyttell conformitie with bloudde 
in their qualities. Of them, whiche do nourishe, 
some are more grosse, some lyghter in digestyon. 
The grosse meate ingendreth grosse bloude, but 
[^f.16r^] 
where it is well concocte in the stomake, and well 
[/5./] 
digested, it maketh the fleshe more fyrme, and 
the officiall members more stronge, thanne fyne 
meates. Wherfore of men, which vse moch labor 
or exercise, also of them, which haue very cholerike 
stomackes here in Englande, grosse meates 
may be eaten in a great quantitie: and in a cholerike 
stomake biefe is better dygested than a chykens 
legge, forasmoche as in a hotte stomacke 
fyne meates be shortly aduste and corrupted. 
[/6./] 
 
Contrarywise in a colde or fleumatyke stomake 
grosse meate abydeth longe vndigested, and maketh 
putrified matter: lyght meates therfore be 
to suche a stomacke more apte and conuenyent. 
The temperate bodye is beste nourysshed with a 
lyttell quantitie of grosse meates: but of temperate 
meates in substaunce and qualytie, they 
maye safely eate a good quantitie. Foreseene alway, 
[/7./] 
that they eate withoute gourmandyse, or 
leaue with sommme appetyte. And here it wolde 
be remembred, that the cholerycke stomake doth 
not desyre soo moche as he maye dygest: the melancholye 
stomacke maye nat dygeste soo moche 
as he desyreth. For colde maketh appetite, but 
naturall heate concocteth or boyleth. Not withstandynge 
vnnaturall or supernaturall heate distroyeth 
appetite, and corrupteth dygestyon, as 
it appereth in feuers. More ouer, fruytes and 
herbes, specyally rawe, wolde be eaten in a small 
quantitie, all thoughe the persone be very cholerycke, 
for asmoche as they do ingender thynne, 
[^f.16v^] 
watrye bloudde, apte to receyue putryfactyon, 
whyche all thoughe it be not shortelye perceyued 
of theym that vse it, at lengthe they feele it 
by sondrye dyseases, whyche are longe in commynge, 
and shortelye sleeth, or be hardely escaped. 
Fynally, excesse of meates is to be abhorred. 
For as it is sayde in the booke called Ecclesiastycus, 
In moche meate shall be syckenesse, 
and inordinate appetite shall approche vnto choler. 
Semblablye, the quantitie of drynke wolde 
be moderated, that it excede not, nor be equalle 
vnto the quantitie of meate, specially wyne, whiche 
moderately taken, aydeth nature, and comforteth 
her, and as the sayde authour of Ecclesiasticus 
sayth, Wyne is a reioycinge to the soule 
and bodye. And Theognes saythe, in Galenes 
warke, A large draught of wyne, is yll. A moderate 
draught is not onely not yll, but also commodiouse 
or profytable. 
 
[}Of qualitie of meates, Cap. 2.}] 
 
QUalytie is in the complexion, that is to say, 
it is the state therof, as Hotte or colde, moist 
or dry. Also some meates be in wynter colde 
in acte, and in vertue hotte. And it wolde be consydered, 
that euery complexyon temperate and 
vntemperate, is conserued in his state, by that 
whyche is lyke therto in fourme and degree. But 
that whyche excedeth moche in dystemperaunce, 
by that whyche is contrarye to hym in fourme or 
[^f.17r^] 
qualytie, but lyke in degree moderately vsed. By 
fourme is vnderstand grossenesse, fynenesse, thickenesse, 
or thynnesse, by degree, as the fyrste, the 
seconde, the thyrde, the fourthe, in heate, colde, 
moysture, or drythe. 
 
[}Of Custome. Capit. 3.}] 
 
CUstome in feedynge is not to be contemned, 
or lyttell regarded: for those meates, to the 
whiche a man hathe bene of longe tyme accustomed, 
though they be not of substaunce commendable, 
[/8./] 
yet do they somtyme lasse harme than better 
meates, whervnto a ma~ is not vsed. Also the 
meates and drynkes, whiche do moch delyte hym 
that eateth, are to be preferrred before that, which 
is better, but more vnsauerye. But yf the custome 
[/9./] 
be soo pernyciouse, that hit needes muste 
be lefte, thanne wolde it be withdrawen by lyttelle 
and lyttelle in tyme of healthe, and not of 
syckenesse. For yf it shoulde be withdrawen in 
tyme of syckenesse, Nature shulde susteyne treble 
detriment, fyrste by the grief induced by syknesse, 
seconde by receyuynge of medicines, thirdly 
by forbearyng the thyng, wherin she deliteth.

[}Of the temperature of meates to be 
receyued. Cap. 4.}] 
 
TO kepe the body in good temper, to theym, 
whose naturall complexion is moyst, ought 
to be gyuen meates, that be moyste in vertue or 
power. Contrarywise to theym, whose naturalle 
complexion is drye, ought to be gyuen meates 
drye in vertue or power. The bodyes vntemperate, 
suche meates or drynkes are to be gyuen, 
which be in power co~trary to the distemperance, 
but the degrees are alwaye to be considered, as 
welle of the temperaunce of the bodye, as of the 
meates. For where the meates doo moche excede 
in degree the temperature of the bodye, they annoye 
the body in causyng distemperaunce, As hot 
wynes, pepper, garlycke, onyons, and salte, be 
noyfull to theym, whyche be choleryke, bycause 
they be in the highest degree of heate and drythe, 
aboue the iuste temperaunce of mannes body in 
that complexion. And yet be they oftentymes holsome 
to them, whiche be fleumatike. Contrarye 
wyse, colde water, colde herbes, and colde fruites 
moderately vsed, be holsom to cholerike bodyes, 
by puttynge away the heate, excedinge the naturall 
temperature: and to them, whyche be fleumatyke, 
they be vnholsome, and doo brynge into 
them distemperaunce of colde and moist.

[}what distemperaunce hapneth by the excesse

[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
[}Of breadde. Cap. 7.}] 
 
BReadde of fyne floure of wheate, hauynge 
no leuyn, is slowe of digestion, and makethe 
slymy humours, but it nourysheth moche: if it be 
leuyned, it digesteth sooner: breade hauing moch 
branne, fylleth the bealy with excrementes, and 
nourysheth lytell or nothynge, but shortly descendeth 
from the stomake: The meane betwene both 
sufficiently leuyned, well moulded, and moderatly 
baken is the moste holsome to euerye age, the 
greatest loues do nouryshe most fast, for asmoch 
[^f.19r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.16.^] 
as the fyre hathe not exhausted the moysture of 
them. Hotte breadde, moch eaten, maketh fulnes 
and thyrste, and slowely passeth. Barley breadde 
clenseth the body, and doth not nouryshe so moch 
as wheate, and maketh colder iuyce in the body. 
 
[}Of fleshe. Cap. 8.}] 
 
BIefe of Englande to Englysshemen, whiche 
are in helth, bringeth stronge nouryshynge, 
but it maketh grosse bloude, and ingendreth melancoly: 
but beyng of yonge oxen, not excedynge 
the age of four yeres, to them, whiche haue colerike 
stomakes, it is more conuenient, than chikens, 
and other lyke fyne meates. 
 
[}Swynes fleshe.}] 
 
Aboue all kyndes of fleshe in nouryshynge the 
body, Galene most commendeth porke, not being 
of an olde swyne, and that it be well digested of 
hym that eateth it. For it maketh beste iuyce, it 
is moste conuenient for yonge persons, and them 
which haue susteyned moch labour, and therwith 
ar fatigate, and become weake, yonge pigges are 
not co~mended before that they be one month old, 
for they do brede superfluous humours. 
 
[}Lambe.}] 
 
Is verye moyste and flumatike, wherfore it is 
not conuenient for aged men, except that it be very 
drye rosted, nor yet for theym, whiche haue in 
their stomake moche fleume. 
 
[}Mutton.}] 
 
Galene dothe not commende it, not withstanding 
[^f.19v^] 
[/10./] 
experience proueth here in this realme, that 
yf it be yonge, it is a right temperate meate, and 
maketh good iuyce: and therfore it is vsed more 
than any other meate, in all diseases. And yet it 
is not lyke good in all places, nor the shepe, whyche 
beareth fynest wolle, is not the swetest in eatynge, 
nor the moste tender. But I haue founde 
in some countrays mutton, whiche in whitenesse, 
tendernesse, and swetenesse of the fleshe, mought 
be well nygh compared to kydde, and in digestion 
haue proued as holsome. 
 
[}Kydde and ueale.}] 
 
Of Galene is commended nexte vnto porke, 
but some men do suppose, that in helth and siknes 
they be moch better than porke, the iuyce of them 
both being more pure. And here it is to be noted, 
that of all beastes, whiche be drye of their nature, 
the yongest be mooste holsome: of them that are 
moyste, the eldest are left hurtfull, 
 
[}Hare, Cony,}] 
 
Maketh grosse bloudde, it dryeth and stoppeth, 
but yet it prouoketh a man to pisse. Cony maketh 
better and more pure nouryshment, and is sooner 
digested than hare. It is well proued, that there 
is noo meate more holsome, or that more cleane, 
firmely, and temperatly norysheth than rabettes. 
 
[}Dere redde and falowe.}] 
 
Hippocrates affyrmeth the fleshe of hartes and 
hyndes, to be of yll iuyce, harde of digestion and 
drye, but yet it moueth vrine. Of falowe dere, he 
nor any other olde writer dothe speake of, as I 
[^f.20r^] 
remembred. I suppose, bycause there be not in all 
the world so many as be in Englande, where they 
consume a good parte of the beste pasture in the 
realme, and are in nothynge profytable, sauynge 
that of the skynnes of them is made better lether 
than is of calues: the huntynge of them beynge 
not so pleasaunt, as the huntynge of other venery 
or vermyne, the flesshe moche more vnholsome 
and vnpleasant, than of a redde dere, ingendring 
melancoly, and makinge many feareful dreames, 
and disposeth the bodye to a feuer, if it be moche 
eaten: not withstandinge the fatte therof, as som 
lerned men haue supposed is better to be digested, 
than the leane. 
 
[}Of Byrdes.}] 
 
THe fleshe of all byrdes, is moch lighter than 
the fleshe of bestes in comparison, most specially 
of those foules, whiche truste most to theyr 
wynges, and do brede in high countreys. 
 
[}Capons, Hennes, and Chyckens.}] 
 
The Capon is aboue all other foules praised, 
for as moche as it is easily digested, and maketh 
lyttell ordure, and moche good noyryshment. It 
is commodious to the breaste and stomake. 
Hennes in wynter, are almooste equall vnto the 
capon, but they do not make so stronge nourishement. 
Auycen sayth, if they be rosted in the bealy 
of a kydde or lambe, they wyll be the better. 
Chickens in sommer, specially if they be cockrelles 
are very conuenient for a weake stomake, and 
[^f.20v^] 
nourisheth a lytell. The fleshe of a cocke is hard 
of digestion, but the brothe, wherin it is boyled, 
louseth the bealy, and hauynge sodden in it colewortes, 
Polypodium, or Cartamus, it purgith yl 
humours, and is medicinable agaynste gowtes, 
ioynt aches, and feuers, which come by courses. 
 
[}Fesaunt.}] 
 
Excedeth all fowles in swetenesse and holsomnesse, 
and is equall to a capon in nourishynge, but 
he is somwhat drier, and is of some men putte in 
co~parison, meane betwene a henne & a partriche. 
 
[}Partryche,}] 
 
Of all fowles is most sonest digested: and hath 
in hym moche nutriment, comforteth the brayne, 
and maketh sede of generation, and receiueth lust 
whiche is abated. 
 
[}Quayles,}] 
 
Although they be of some men commended, yet 
experience proueth them to increace melancolye, 
and are of a small nourisshinge. 
 
[}Larkes,}] 
 
Be as well the fleshe as the broth, very holsom, 
eaten rosted, they do moche helpe ageinst the colyke, 
as Dioscorides sayth. 
 
[}A plouer,}] 
 
Is slowe of digestion, nourysheth lytell, and increaseth 
melancolye. 
 
[}Blacke byrdes or ousyls,}] 
 
Amonge wylde fowle hath the chiefe prayse, for 
lyghtnesse of digestion, and that they make good 
nouryshment, and lyttell ordure. 
 
[^f.21r^] 
[}Sparowes}] 
 
Be harde to digest, and are very hote, and styreth 
vp Uenus, and specially the brayns of them. 
 
[}Woodcockes,}] 
 
Are of a good temperaunce, and metely lyghte 
in digestion. 
 
[}Pygeons,}] 
 
Be easily digested, and ar very holsom to them, 
whiche are fleumatike, or pure melancoly. 
 
[}Goose,}] 
 
Is hard of digestion, but being yong and fatte, 
the wynges be easy to dygeste in a hole stomake, 
and noyrysheth competently. 
 
[}Ducke,}] 
 
Is hoter than goose, & hard to digest, & maketh 
wars iuice, sauing the braunes on the breast bone 
and the necke is better than the remnaunt. 
 
[}Crane and bustarde,}] 
 
Crane is harde of digestion, and maketh ylle 
iuyce, but beinge hanged vp longe in the ayre, he 
is the lasse vnholsome. Bustarde being fatte, and 
kept without meate a day or two afore that he be 
kylled, to expulse his ordure, and than drawen, 
and hanged as the crane is, beinge rosted or baken, 
is a good meate, and nourysheth well, if he 
be well digested. 
 
[}Hearon, Byttour, Shoueler,}] 
 
Beinge yonge and fatte, be lyghtlyer dygested 
than crane: and the byttour soner than the hearone. 
And the shouelar sooner than any of them: 
but all these fowles muste be eaten with moche 
[^f.21v^] 
gynger or pepper. & haue good olde wine drunke 
after theym, and soo shall they be more easylye 
dygested, and the iuyce commynge of theym, be 
the lasse noyfull. 
 
[}The partes and members of byrdes and 
beastes. Cap. 9.}] 
 
THe wynges brawnes and necke of gese, capons, 
hennes, fesaunt, partriche, and smalle 
byrdes beinge fatte, are better than the legges in 
digestion, and lyghter in nourishyng. Of wylde 
foule and pygeons beinge fatte, the legges are 
better than the wynges: the brawnes of ducke, 
teale, and wygeon except, whiche is better to dygeste: 
than the residue. 
 
[}The gysar or stomake}] 
 
Of a goose or henne beinge fatte with branne 
and mylke, beinge well sodden or made in poulder, 
is good for the stomake, in makinge it strong 
to digest, and nourysheth competently. 
 
[}The lyuer,}] 
 
Of a capon, henne, fesaunte, or goose, beinge 
made fatte with mylke myxte with their meate, 
is not onely easy to digeste, but also maketh good 
iuyce, and nourysheth excellently. But the lyuers 
of beastes be yll to digest, passethe slowly, and maketh 
grosse bloud, but it is strong in nourishinge. 
 
[^f.22r^] 
[}The inwarde of beastes, as trypes and 
chytterlynges.}] 
 
THe flesshe of them is more harde to dygest. 
And therfore although they be wel digested, 
yet make they not iuyce naturallye sanguyne or 
cleane, but rawe iuyce and colde: and requyreth 
a longe tyme to be conuerted in to bloud, 
 
[}The lunges or lyghtes}] 
 
Are more easy to digest, than the lyuer, and lasse 
nourisheth, but the nourishment, that it maketh, 
is fleumatike: albeit the lunges of a Foxe, is medicinable 
for them, which haue siknes of y=e= lu~ges. 
 
[}The splene or mylte,}] 
 
Is of yl iuice, for it is the chamber of melancoly. 
 
[}The harte,}] 
 
Is of harde fleshe, and therfore is not wel digested, 
nor passeth shortly, but where he is wel digested, 
the iuyce y=t= it maketh, is not to be dispraised. 
 
[}The brayne}] 
 
Is fleumatyke, of grosse iuyce, slowe in dygestyng, 
noyouse to the stomake, but where it is wel 
digested, it nourisheth moche. 
 
[}Marowe}] 
 
Is more delectable than the brayne, it is yll for 
the stomacke, but where it is well digested, it norysheth 
moche. 
 
[}The stones and vdders}] 
 
Beinge well digested, do nouryshe moche, but 
the stones are hotter with their moystnes, the vdders 
colde and fleumatike, they both do increase 
sede of generation, but the bloud made of the vdder 
[^f.22v^] 
is better than that, whiche cometh of the stones, 
excepte it be of calues and lambes. Also the 
stones of cockes, maketh co~mendable norishme~t. 
 
[}The head,}] 
 
The fleshe therof nourysheth moche, and augmenteth 
seede: but it is slowe of digestion, and 
noyeth the stomake, but to them, whiche vse moche 
exercise, it is not discommendable. 
 
[}The tounge,}] 
 
Is of a spu~gy and sanguine substance, but the 
kernelles and gristell, whiche are in the rootes, 
if they be wel digested, they make good nourishme~t: 
if they be not wel digested, they make fleme. 
 
[}The feete}] 
 
Beinge welle boyled and tender, in a holle stomake, 
dygesteth welle, and maketh good iuyce, 
and passeth forth easily. Galene commendeth the 
fete of swyne. But I haue proued, that the feete 
of a yonge bullocke tenderly sodden, and layde 
in sowse two dayes or thre, and eaten colde in the 
euenninge, haue brought a colerike stomake into 
a good digestion and slepe, and therwith hath also 
expulsed salt fleme and coler, and thus haue I 
found in my selfe by often experience: alway forsene, 
that it be eaten before any other meate, with 
out drynkynge immediatly after it. 
 
[}Of fyshe generally. Cap. 10.}] 
 
THe beste fyshe after the opinion of Galen, is 
that, whiche swymmeth in the pure sea, and 
is tossed and lyfte vp with wyndes and sourges. 
[^f.23r^] 
The more calme that the water is, the warse is 
the fyshe, they whiche are in muddy waters, doo 
make moche fleume and ordure: taken in fennes 
and dyches by warste, beinge in fresshe ryuers, 
and swyfte, be sometyme commendable: all be it 
generally, al kyndes of fyshe maketh more thinner 
bloud, than fleshe, so that it dothe not moche 
nouryshe, and it doth soner passe out by vapors: 
to a hotte colerike stomake, or in feuers, somtyme 
they be holsome, being newe, freshe, and not very 
harde in substance or slymy. harde fyshe is harde 
of digestion, but the nourishment therof is more 
firme, than that, which is softe: those which haue 
moche grosse humours in them, ar best, poudred. 
 
[}Of Butter. Cap. 11.}] 
 
BUtter is also nourishynge, and profiteth to 
them, whiche haue humours superfluouse 
in the breaste or lunges, and lacketh ripynge and 
clensynge of theym: specially if it be eaten with 
sugar or honye. If it be well salted, it heatethe 
and clenseth the more. 
 
[}Of Chese. Cap. 12.}] 
 
CHese by the hole sentence of all writers, letteth 
digestion, and is ennemye vnto the stomake. 
Also it ingendreth yll humours, and bredeth 
the stone. The chese which doth leest harme, 
is softe chese, reasonably salted, which some men 
do suppose, nourysheth moche. 
 
[^f.23v^] 
[}Of Egges. Cap. 13.}] 
 
EGges of fesauntes, hennes, and partryches, 
be of all other meates moste agreable vnto 
nature, specially if they be newe layde: If they 
be rere, they do clense the throte and brest. If they 
be harde, they be slowe in digestion. but beynge 
ones digested, theu do nouryshe moche. Meane 
betwene rere and harde, they digest conueniently 
and nouryshe quyckely. Egges well poched, are 
better than rosted. If they be fried harde, they be 
of yll nouryshment, and do make stynkynge fumes 
in the stomake, and do corrupt other meates 
with whome they be myngled. They be most holsome 
whan thay be poched, and moste vnholsome 
whan they be fryed. Dioscorides sayth, If they 
be souped warme, before any other meat, they do 
heale the grefes of the bladder and raynes, made 
with grauell: also sorenes of the chekes & throte, 
and spittyng of bloude: and they be good ageinst 
catars or stilling out of the hed into the stomake. 
 
[}Of Fruites. Cap. 14.}] 
 
FOr as moche as before that tyllage of corne 
was inuented, and that deuouringe of fleshe 
and fyshe was of mankynde vsed, men vndoubtedlye 
lyued by fruites, and Nature was therewith 
contented and satisfied: but by chaunge of 
the diete of our progenytours, there is caused to 
be in our bodyes, suche alteration frome the nature, 
whiche was in men at the begynnynge, that 
nowe all fruites generally are noyfull to manne, 
[^f.24r^] 
and do ingender yll humours, and be ofte tymes 
the cause of putrified feuers, if they be moche and 
continually eaten. Not withstanding vnto them, 
which haue abundaunce of coler, they be somtime 
conuenient, to represse the flame, which procedeth 
of coler. And some fruites whiche be styptike, or 
bynding in tast, eaten before meales, do bynd the 
bely, but eten after meales, they be rather laxatiue. 
 
[}Of Gourdes.}] 
 
GOurdes rawe be vnpleasant in eatinge, yll 
for the stomake, and almost neuer digested, 
therfore he that wyll nedes eate them, must boyle 
them, roste them, or frye them, euery waye they be 
without sauour or taste, and of theyr proper nature, 
they gyue to the body cold and moyst norishment, 
and that very lyttell, but by reason of the 
slyppernes of their substance, and bycause al meates 
whiche be moyste of their nature, be not byndynge, 
they lyghtly passe forth by the bealye. And 
being well ordred, they wyll be metely concoct, if 
corruption in the stomake do not preuent them: 
they be cold and moist in the seconde degree. 
 
[}Of Melones and Pepones.}] 
 
MElones and Pepones be almooste of oone 
kynde, but that the melone is rounde lyke 
an apple, and the innermoste parte therof, where 
the sedes are conteyned, is vsed to be eaten. The 
Pepon is moche greatter, and somewhat longe 
and the inner part therof is not to be eaten: They 
[^f.24v^] 
bothe are very colde and moyst, and do make yll 
iuyce in the body, if they be not well digested, but 
the pepon moch more than the melon, they do lest 
hurt, if they be eaten afore meales. Albe it, if they 
do fynde in the stomake fleume, they be turned in 
to fleume, if they finde choler, they be turned in to 
choler. Not withstandynge there is in theym the 
vertue to clense & to prouoke vrine, they be colde 
and moyst in the seconde degree. 
 
[}Cucumbers.}] 
 
CUcumbers do not excede so moche in moysture 
as melons: and therfore they be not so 
[/11./] 
soone corrupted in the stomacke: but in some stomakes, 
being moderatly vsed, they do digest wel: 
but if they be abundantely eaten, or moche vsed, 
they ingender a colde and thycke humour in the 
veynes, whiche neuer or seldome is tourned in to 
good bloud, and somtyme bryngeth in feuers. Also 
they abate carnall lust. The sedes as wel thereof, 
as of melones and gourdes, beinge dryed, and 
made cleane from the huskes, are very medycinable 
against syckenesses procedynge of heate, also 
the difficultie or let in pyssynge, they be colde and 
moist in the second degre. 
 
[}Dates,}] 
 
BE harde to digeste, therfore beinge moche eaten, 
and not wel digested, they annoy the head 
and cause gnawynge in the stomacke, and make 
grosse iuyce, and sometyme cause obstructyons 
or stoppynges in the lyuer and splene. And where 
[^f.25r^] 
there is inflammation or hardnesse in the bodye, 
they are vnholsome, but beinge well digested and 
temperately vsed, they nouryshe and make the 
fleshe firme, and also byndeth the bealy: olde dates 
be hotte and dry in the fyrst degree: newe gathered 
are hotte and moist in the first degree. 
 
[}Of Fygges.}] 
 
FIgges eaten, do shortely passe out of the stomacke, 
and are soone distributed in to all the 
partes of the body, and haue the power to clense, 
[/12./] 
specially grauelle, beinge in the raynes of the 
backe, but they make no substancial norishment, 
but rather somewhat lowse and wyndye, but by 
their quicke passage, the wynde is sone dissolued. 
Therfore if they be rype, they do least harme of any 
fruites, or almoste none. Dry figges and old, 
are more hotte and drye than newe gathered, but 
beinge moche eaten, they make yll bloudde and 
iuyce, and as some do suppose, do ingender lyce, 
and also anoyeth the lyuer and the splene, if they 
be inflamed, but hauinge the power to attenuate 
or make humours currant, they make the bodye 
soluble, and do clense the raynes. Also beinge eaten 
afore diner with gynger or pepper, or powder 
of tyme, or peny royall, they profyt moch to them, 
whiche haue oppilations or harde congeled matter 
in the inner partes of the body, or haue distillations 
or reumes fallyng into the breste and stomake. 
New figges are hot and moist, olde figges 
are hot in the first degree, and drie in the seconde. 
 
[^f.25v^] 
[}Of grapes and raisons.}] 
 
[/13./] 
GRapes do not nouryshe so moch as fygges, 
but beinge rype, they make not moche ylle 
iuyce in the body: albeit newely gathered, they 
trouble the bealye, and fylleth the stomacke with 
wynde. therfore if they be hanged vp a whyle, er 
they be eaten, they are the lasse noyfull. Sweete 
[/14./] 
grapes are hottest, and do lowse somewhat, and 
make a man thyrsty. Sowre grapes are cold, and 
do also lowse, but they are hard of digestion, and 
yet they do not nourishe. They whiche are in tast 
bytter or harryshe, be lyke to them that are soure. 
Raysons do make the stomake firme and strong, 
and do prouoke apetite, and do comforte weake 
bodyes, beinge eaten afore meales: they be hotte

AL appulles eaten sone after that they be gathered, 
are cold, hard to digest, and do make 
yll and corrupted bloudde, but beinge well kepte

after meales, they are right holsome, and doo 
confirme the stomake, and make good digestion, 
specially if they be rosted or baken, most properly 
in a cholerike stomake. They are beste preserued 
in hony, so y=t= one touch not an other. The roughe

cause good appetite, and preserueth the hed from 
drunkennesse: taken after meate, it closeth and 
draweth the stomake togyther, and helpeth it to 
digeste, and mollyfieth the bealy, if it be aboundantly
