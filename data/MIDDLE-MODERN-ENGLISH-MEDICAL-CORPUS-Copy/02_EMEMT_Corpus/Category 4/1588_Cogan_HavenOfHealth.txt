[}WHAT LABOR IS: 
The commoditie thereof, the difference 
of labors, the preparation to labor, the 
time, the measure of 
Labor.}] 
 
[}CHAP. 1.}] 
 
THE first word in order of that 
golden sentence proposed by Hippocrates, 
[/1./] 
is labour, which in this 
place signifieth exercise. For so is 
the word Labour commonly taken 
of Hippo. as Galen witnesseth, 
[/2./] 
saying: Hippo. is wont to take 
this worde Labour for exercise. 
[/3./] 
Labour then, or exercise, is a vehement mouing, the ende 
whereof is alteration of the breath or winde of man. Of 
[/4./] 
exercise doe proceede many commodities, but especially 
three. The first is hardnesse and strength of the members, 
whereby labour shall the lesse greeue, and the body bee 
more strong to labour. And that exercise or labour doth 
[/5./] 
strengthen the body, beside the witnes of Galen, where 
he sayth, By exercises also there commeth a certaine 
strength to the lymmes, when as both naturall heate 
is kindled, and a certaine hardnesse and patience is 
caused by rubbing the partes one with another: It is 
prooued by experience in labourers, who for the more 
part be stronger than learned men, and can endure greater 
toyle. Whereof wee haue a notable example in Milo 
[^p.2^] 
Crotoniates, who by the vse of carying a Calfe euery 
[/6./] 
day certaine furlongs, was able to carrie the same beeing 
a Bull. The second commoditie of labour is encrease of 
[/7./] 
heat. Whereby happeneth the more alteration of thinges 
to be digested, also more quicke alteration and better nourishing. 
The third is more violence of the breath or wind, 
[/8./] 
whereby the pores are cleansed, and the filth of the body 
naturally expelled. These thinges are so necessarie to the 
preseruation of health, that without them, no man may be 
long without sicknesse. For as the flowing water doeth 
not lightly corrupt, but that which standeth still: Euen 
so bodies exercised are for the more part more healthfull, 
and such as be idle more subiect to sicknesse. According to 
that saying of the Poet Ouid, 
[/9./] 
 
Cernis vt ignauum corrumpant otia corpus, 
Vt capiant vitium ni moueantur aquæ. 
[/10./] 
 
Which also is affirmed by Cornelius Celsus, saying: 
Slouthfulnes dulleth the bodie, Labour doth strength 
it: The one maketh vs soone olde, the other maketh 
vs long yong. Yea Galen himselfe is of the same minde, 
[/11./] 
for thus he saith: As sluggish rest of the body is a great 
discommoditie for the preseruing of health, So there 
is very great profite in moderate exercise. But there 
is great difference of exercises. For some are swift, as 
[/12./] 
running, playing with weapons, throwing of the ball. 
Some are strong or violent, as wrastling, casting the bar. 
Some are vehement, as dansing, leaping, footeball play. 
Againe, some are exercises onely, as those now rehearsed, 
& other mentioned of Galen not vsed among vs. Some 
are not onely exercises but workes also, as to digge or 
delue, to eare or plowe lande, or to doe any other worke 
appertaining to husbandrie, or whatsoeuer Craftes men 
of any occupation are wont to do for the vse & commoditie 
of mans life. For these as they are labors, so are they exercises, 
& do make a good state or liking of y=e= body, as Galen 
[/13./] 
declareth, & is found true by co~mon experience in Engla~d. 
 
[^p.3^] 
For husbandmen and craftesmen, for the more parte doe 
[/14./] 
liue longer and in better health, than Gentlemen and learned 
men, and such as liue in bodyly rest. Wherefore Galen 
himselfe sometime vsed rustical labours, especially in 
[/15./] 
Winter: as to cleaue wood, to punne Barley, and such 
like. Againe some exercises are appropried to the partes 
of the body, as running, and going are the proper exercises 
of the legges. Mouing of the armes vp and downe, or 
[/16./] 
stretching them out as in shooting and playing with 
weapons, serueth most for the armes and shoulders. 
Stouping & rising oftentimes, as playing at the bowles, 
as lifting greate waightes, taking vp of plummets or other 
like poyses on the ende of staues, these doe exercise 
the backe and loynes. Of the bulke and lungs the proper 
exercise is mouing of the breath in singing, reading, or 
crying. The musckles, and together with them the 
sinnewes, veins, arteries, bones, are exercised co~sequently, 
by the mouing of the partes aforesaide. The stomacke 
and entrals, and thighes, and reines of the backe are 
chiefly exercised by ryding. As for sitting in a boate or 
barge which is rowed, riding in a horse litter, Coache, or 
Waggen, is a kind of exercise which is called gestation: 
and is mixte with moouing and rest, and is conuenient 
[/17./] 
for them that be weake and impotent, or in long and continuall 
sicknes. But aboue all other kindes of exercises, 
Galen most commendeth the play with the little ball, 
which wee call Tenise, in so much that hee hath written a 
[/18./] 
peculiar booke of this exercise, and preferreth it before 
hunting, and all other pastimes. Because it may be easily 
vsed of all estates, as being of little cost. But chiefly for 
that it doth exercise all partes of the body alike, as the 
legges, armes, necke, head, eies, back and loynes, and delighteth 
greatly the minde, making it lusty and cheereful. 
All which commodities may bee found in none other 
kinde of exercise. For they streine more one part of the 
body than an other, as shooting, the armes, running, the 
[^p.4^] 
legges, &c. wherefore those founders of Colleges are 
highly to be praysed, that haue erected Tenis courtes, for 
the exercise of their Scholers: and I counsaile all students 
as much as they may to vse that pastime. Notwithstanding 
I restraine no man from his naturall inclination, 
for I know that to be true which Virgil writeth. 
[/19./] 
[/20./] 
 
Trahit sua quemq~ voluptas. And as Horace saith, 
Castor gaudet equis, ouo prognatus codem, 
Pugnis, quot viuunt capitum, totidem studiorum 
Millia.- 
 
[/21./] 
For in the Mount Olimpus in Greece, where the 
most principall playes and exercises of all the worlde 
were solemnly kept and vsed euerie fifth yere, first ordeyned 
by Hercules the Champion (as it is thought) al men 
did not practise one onely kinde of actiuitie, but euery man 
as he was minded, so hee applyed himselfe. There was 
wrastling, running with horses and on foote, turning, leaping, 
coursing with Chariots, contentions of Poets, 
Rhetoricians, musicians, disputations of Philosophers, 
and others. So I restraine no man from his naturall inclination, 
but I shewe what exercise is best by the iudgement 
[/22./] 
of Galen. But least that by the violence of heate 
kindled by exercise, any of the excrementes should hastily 
bee receiued into the habit of the body, also least 
some thing which is whole should by heauinesse of excrementes 
or violent motion bee broken or pulled out of 
place, or that the excrements by violence of the breath 
should stoppe the pores or Cundites of the bodie, the olde 
[/23./] 
Greekes and Romanes were wont to vse fricacies or 
rubbings before exercise in this manner. First to rub 
the bodie with a course lynnen cloth softly and easilie, and 
after to increase more and more to a hard and swift rubbing, 
vntill the fleshe doe swell and be somwhat ruddie: 
[^p.5^] 
then to annoint it with sweete oyle, stroking it euery way 
gentlie with bare handes. And of fricacies they haue 
[/24./] 
made generallie three sorts, first hard rubbing to binde or 
consolidate, then soft rubbing to loose or mollifie, and lastlie 
meane rubbing to augment and increase flesh. But 
this kinde of preparation whereof Galen hath written abundantly 
in his seconde booke De Sa. Tuen. is not vsed 
in England, and therefore I will ende it with a merrie 
tale of Augustus the Emperour and an olde Souldier. 
[/25./] 
On a time as the noble Emperour Augustus came to a 
bath, he behelde an olde man that had doone good seruice 
in the warres, rubbing himselfe against a Marble piller, 
for lacke of one to helpe him. The Emperour mooued 
with pittie gaue an annuitie, to finde him a seruant to 
waite vpon him. When this was knowen, a great sort of 
old soldiers drewe them together and stoode whereas the 
Emperour shoulde passe by, euerie one of them rubbing 
his backe against the stones, the Emperour demaunded 
why they did so, because (noble Emperour say they) wee 
be not able to keepe seruantes to doe it. Why (quoth the 
Emperour) one of you might clawe and rubbe an others 
backe well enough. So wiselie did he delude the practise 
of Parasites, according to the olde prouerbe, It is mery 
when knaues meete. Notwithstanding Maister Eliot 
reporteth of himselfe, that hee found greate commoditie 
in one kinde of fricacie, which is thus. In the morning 
[/26./] 
after we haue beene at the stoole, with our shirt sleeues or 
bare handes (if our flesh be tender) first softlie and afterwarde 
faster to rubbe the brestes and sides, downewarde 
and ouertwharte, not touching the stomacke and bellie, 
and after to cause our seruant semblably to rubbe ouertwharte 
the shoulders and backe beginning at the necke 
bone, not touching the raines of the backe, except wee 
doo feele there much colde and winde, and afterwarde 
the legges from the knee to the anckle, last the armes 
from the elbowe to the hande wrest. And for those that 
[^p.6^] 
cannot exercise their bodies at conuenient times, either 
because they are letted with necessarie businesse, or else by 
reason of vtter weakenesse, this kinde of rubbing may 
well bee vsed in steede of exercise. For rubbing is in 
steede of exercise as Georgius Pictorius writeth. But 
leauing all kind of fricacies to such as haue leasure, I prescribe 
none other preparation to bee vsed before exercise, 
[/27./] 
but onely euacuation of excrementes from all such partes 
as nature hath appointed therevnto. That is, when you 
are risen from sleepe, to walke little vp and downe, that 
so the superfluitie of the stomacke, guttes and liuer, may 
the more speedilie descende, and the more easilie be expelled. 
[/28./] 
That doone to wash your face and handes, with 
cleane colde water, and especiallie to bath and plunge the 
eyes therein. For that not onelie cleanseth away the filth, 
but also comforteth and greatlie preserueth the sight, (as 
Auicen writeth) whereof studentes shoulde haue a speciall 
care. Moreouer to extende and stretch out your 
handes, and feete and other limmes, that the vitall 
spirites may come to the vtter partes of the bodie. Also 
to combe your heade that the pores may bee opened to 
[/29./] 
auoide such vapours as yet by sleepe are not consumed. 
Then to rubbe and clense the teeth. For the filthinesse 
of the teethe is noysome to the braine, to the breath, 
[/30./] 
and to the stomacke. They may bee clensed (as Cornelius 
Celsus teacheth) by washing the mouth with 
[/31./] 
colde water, putting thereto a little vinegar. And 
with the same (if you list) you may gargarize or guddle 
in your throate, and after rubbe them harde with a drie 
cloth. Some vse to rubbe their teethe and gummes 
when they washe with a sage leafe or two, which is 
good to preserue them from corruption and abateth the 
ranke sauour of the mouth. All these thinges (which 
are sixe in number) are briefely comprehended in Schola 
Salerni, as followeth. 
 
[^p.7^] 
Lumina mane, manus surgens gelida lauet vnda. 
Hac illac modicum pergat, modicum sua membra 
Extendat, crines pectat, dentes fricet: ista 
[/32./] 
Confortant cerebrum, confortant cætera membra. 
 
After this preparation, as occasion shall serue, you 
may fall to exercise, yet first you must diligently consider 
where and when (that is to say) the place, and time. The 
[/33./] 
place where exercise is to bee vsed doeth cheefely concerne 
the ayre, which among all thinges, not naturall, 
as in habitation, so in exercise is greatly to bee regarded, 
[/34./] 
for as much as it doeth both enclose vs about, and also 
enter into our bodies, especiallie the moste noble member 
which is the heart, and wee cannot bee seperate 
one houre from it for the necessitie of breathing. Wherefore 
exercise must bee vsed in a good and wholesome aire, 
[/35./] 
which consisteth in foure pointes, first that it be faire and 
cleare without vapours and mistes. Secondlie, that it bee 
lightsome and open, and darke, troublous and close. 
Thirdly that it bee not infected with carraine lying long 
aboue ground. Fourthly, that it be not stincking or corrupted 
with ill vapours, as beeing neere to draughtes, 
Sinckes, Dunghilles, Gutters, Chanels, Kitchins, 
Churchyards, or standing waters. For the aire so corrupted, 
being drawne into our bodies, must of necessitie corrupt 
our bodies also. These foure properties are breefly 
conteined in two verses in Schola Salerni. 
 
Lucidus & mundus sit rite habitabilis aer, 
Infectus neque sit, nec olens fætore cloacæ. 
 
Nowe for the time when you shoulde exercise, that 
[/36./] 
diuine Phisician Hippocrates teacheth vs playnely, saying. 
Let labour goe before meate. Whose authoritie 
[/37./] 
Galen following, sayth, We must begin the preseruation 
[^p.8^] 
of health with labour, after that take meate, drincke, and 
so foorth. The time then most conuenient for exercise, is 
when both the first and seconde digestion is complete, as 
well in the stomache as in the veines, and that the time 
approcheth to eate againe. For if you doe exercise sooner, 
or later, you shall either fill the bodie with rawe humours 
[/38./] 
or else augment yellowe choler. The knowledge of 
this time is perceiued by the colour of the Urine, for 
that which resembleth vnto cleare Water, betokeneth 
that the iuyce which commeth from the stomache is 
crude in the vrines. That which is well coloured, not too 
high or base, betokeneth that the seconde digestion is 
nowe perfect. Where the colour is very high or redde, 
it signifieth that the concoction is more than sufficient: 
Wherefore when the Urine appeareth in a temperate 
colour, not red nor pale, but as it were guilt, then 
shoulde exercise haue his beginning. By this meanes 
doeth Galen trie out the time moste fitte for exercise. 
But because euery man hath not skill to iudge of Urine, 
or hath not leasure or oportunitie to viewe his Water 
in a glasse as often as hee woulde or shoulde exercise, for 
[/39./] 
the time moste conuenient, it shall bee sufficient to remember 
that Golden sentence of Hippocrates. Let exercise 
be vsed before meate. 
 
Which rule (as that famous Phisicion Fuchsius noteth) 
is vnaduisedly neglected in the Schooles of Germanie. 
For there the Schollers neuer exercise but 
foorthwith after meate, eyther leaping, or running, or 
playing at the Ball, or coyting, or such like. And the 
[/40./] 
same abuse is rife among vs heere in England, both in 
vniuersities and in the grammer Schooles. Wherefore 
it is no meruaile if Scholers oftentimes bee troubled 
with Scabbes and other infirmities growing of corrupt 
humours: because by that meanes greate store of 
rawe humours are ingendred and brought foorth to the 
Skinne: (according to the saying of Hippocrates) 
[^p.9^] 
If a man exercise vnpurged, byles will breake foorth. 
[/41./] 
Wherefore I counsaile all studentes not to exercise immediately 
after meate, for by that meanes the meate is 
conueied into all the members before it bee concocted or 
boyled sufficiently. Yet to rise vp after meate, and to stand 
vpright for a while, or to walke softly a little is very holsome: 
[/42./] 
that so the meate may descende to the bottome of 
the stomacke, where (as Auicenna writeth) resteth the 
vertue of concoction, and is one of the first lessons in Schola 
Salerni, To rise after meate. But hastie moouing driueth 
the naturall heate from the inward partes, and causeth 
ill digestion. As for craftesmen, and labourers, if any 
demaund the question howe they can haue their health, 
and fall to worke straight after they haue eaten, I answere 
with Virgill: Greate labour ouercommeth all 
[/43./] 
things. And as Galen writeth, We write these things, 
neyther to the Germanes, nor to other rude and barbarous 
nations, no more then to Beares and Bores, 
and Lyons, and such like: but to the Gretians, and 
to them which though they bee Barbarians by kind, 
yet they followe the facions of Greece. So I write 
not these precepts for labouring men, but for studentes, 
and such as though they bee no students, doe yet folowe 
the order and diet of students. Antonius the Romane emperour, 
[/44./] 
who liued in Galens time, and had a speciall care 
of his health, was wont to come to the wrastling place about 
sunne setting when dayes were at the shortest, and 
about nine or ten of the clocke when they were at the longest. 
[/45./] 
Whose example is any list to followe (as Georgius 
Pictorius doth interprete) hee shoulde exercise in Summer 
sixe houres before noone, and in the Winter in the 
after noone at Sunne going downe, and in the spring 
time neere by noone. But I restrain no man to the houre, 
[/46./] 
so it bee done according to the rules aforesayde, that is 
breeflie to conclude after the excrements bee auoyded, 
In an wholsome ayre, and before meate: Yet is it not 
[^p.10^] 
sufficient in exercise to obserue the time, the thinges proceeding, 
except wee keepe a measure therein: which also is 
taught by Hippocrates in the worde (mediocria). And 
although euerie man doth knowe (as Cicero sayth) that 
[/47./] 
a measure is best in all thinges, or that measure is a merie 
meane, yet fewe can hit that meane, as well in other 
thinges as in this, vnlesse they bee directed by a certaine 
[/48./] 
rule. Wherefore Galen, who leaueth nothing vnperfect, 
setteth downe foure notes, by the which we may knowe 
[/49./] 
howe long wee shoulde exercise, and when we should giue 
ouer. The first is to exercise vntill the flesh doe swell: The 
second, is vntill the flesh be somewhat ruddie: The third, 
vntill the bodie be nimble, actiue, and readie to all motions: 
The fourth is, vntill sweate and hot vapours burst 
foorth. For when any of these doe alter, we must giue ouer 
exercise. First, if the swelling of the flesh shall seeme to 
abate, we must giue ouer foortwith. For if we should proceede, 
some of the good iuyce also would be brought forth, 
and by that meanes the bodie should become more slender 
and drier, and lesse able to encrease. Secondly, if the liuely 
colour stirred vp by exercise shall vanish away, wee must 
leaue off, for by continuance the body would waxe colder. 
Thirdly, when agility of the limmes shall begin to fayle, 
wee must giue ouer, leaste wearinesse and feeblenesse doe 
ensue. Fourthly, when the qualitie or quantity of the 
sweate is chaunged, we must ceasse, least by continuance, 
the sweate bee greater or hotter, and so the bodie become 
colder and drier. But of these foure notes, sweat and swelling 
of the flesh, are the cheefest to be marked in exercise, 
as Hippocrates sheweth. In exercises sweate is a signe 
[/50./] 
of extenuation comming foorth by droppes, and as 
it were flowing out of little brookes: or else abating 
of the tumour. As who shoulde say, sweat and abating 
of the fleshe are two of the cheefest signes, to know when 
we should giue ouer exercise. This measure Pythagoras, 
that was first named a Philosopher, (though no Physitian, 
[^p.11^] 
hath yet defined in his golden verses. 
 
Thus latined by Vitus Amerbachius. 
 
Corporis & debes non intermittere curam, 
Inque cibo potuque modus sit, gymnasiisque. 
Hoc fiet lassum, si te non illa grauabunt. 
 
The same in effect is vttered by that excellent Greeke 
Orator Isocrates in his Oration ad Demonicum. Vse 
those exercises of the body, which may rather preuail 
thy health than thy strength: which thou mayest obtaine 
by this meanes, If thou leaue off from labour, 
while thou art yet able to labour. 
 
Nowe as I haue shewed what time we shoulde giue 
[/51./] 
ouer exercise, so heere I will ende my treatise of excercise, if 
first I shall declare, what remedie is to bee vsed against 
wearinesse, which commeth by immoderate labour, either 
voluntary or necessary, for wee can not alwayes keepe the 
meane, but wee must doe as cause requireth. Wearinesse, 
as all other infirmities of the body, is cured by the contrary: 
that is to say, by rest. According to the saying of 
Hippocrates: In euery motion of the body, when it 
[/52./] 
beginneth to be weary, then to rest by and by, is a remedy 
of wearines. For when the body is tyred through 
ouer much labour, and strength fayleth, and naturall moisture 
decayeth, then rest for a time recouereth strength, reuiueth 
the spirites, and maketh the limmes able to endure 
labour, whereas otherwise they would soone languish and 
pine away. Which thing Ouid well perceiued, as appeareth 
where he sayth, 
 
Quod caret alterna requie durabile non est. 
Hæc reuocat vires, fessaque membra leuat. 
[/53./] 
 
Where the Poet hath worthily added the worde (Alterna) 
that is to say (doone by course) for as it is not conuenient 
[^p.12^] 
alwayes to labour, so is it not good alwayes to 
rest. For that were idlenesse or slouthfulnesse, which corrupteth 
both the body and soule. For in the body through 
immoderate rest is ingendred cruditie, and great store of 
noysome humours. Wherefore Galen reckoneth Idlenesse 
or immoderate rest, among the causes of colde diseases. 
[/54./] 
And what inconuenience doth growe vnto the soule 
thereby, is taught by the example of King Dauid, who 
through his idlenesse committed adultery. 1. Sam. 
11. 1. But moderate rest doeth comfort both the body and 
[/55./] 
minde as Ouid writeth. 
 
Otia corpus alunt, animus queque pascitur illis. 
Immodicus contra, carpit vtrumque labor. 
 
Wherefore I will conclude with that notable sentence 
[/56./] 
of Galen: As sluggish rest of the body is a very great discommoditie 
to the preseruing of health, so no doubt in moderate 
motion there is verie great commoditie. 
 
[}Of studie or exercise of the minde in what 
order wee may study without hindrance 
of our health.}] 
 
[}Chap. 2.}] 
 
AS man doth consist of two partes, that is 
of body and soul, so exercise is of two sorts, 
that is to say, of the body, and of the mind. 
Hitherto I haue spoken of exercise of the 
body, now I will entreat of exercise of the 
minde, which is Studie: that is (as Tully 
[/57./] 
defineth it,) A continuall and earnest cogitation applied 
[/58./] 
to some thing with great desire. 
 
This kind of exercise (as Tullie writeth) is the naturall 
[/59./] 
nourishment of the mind and wit, for so he saith, The consideration 
[^p.13^] 
and contemplatio~ of nature, is as it were a 
certaine naturall foode of our mindes and wittes, 
and to a learned and skilfull man, to studie, is to liue. 
And likewise, there is so greate loue of learning and 
knowledge ingrafted in vs by nature, that no man 
can doubt, but that mans nature of it self, without 
any commoditie is drawen thereunto. Which thing 
may well be perceiued euen in little children: for as soone 
as they haue gotten strength to goe of themselues, they 
are as busie as bees, and they deuise a thousande toyes to 
be occupied in. Which motions no doubt proceede from 
the minde. For (as Tullie sayth) The musing of the 
[/60./] 
minde neuer ceaseth. Idlenesse therefore is not onely against 
[/61./] 
nature, but also dulleth the minde, as Ouid woorthily 
writeth: 
[/62./] 
 
Adde quod ingenium longarubigine læsum, 
Torpet, & est multo quam fuit ante minus. 
Fertilis assiduo si non renouetur aratro, 
Nil nisi cum spinis gramen habebit ager. 
 
Wherefore notable is that counsell of Isocrates ad 
Demonicum, Endeuour to bee laborious in body, and 
studious in minde: for as our bodyes are encreased 
by moderate laboures, so are our mindes by honest 
doctrine. Which lesson, Publius Scipio, who first was 
[/63./] 
named Aphricanus, wel followed as Tullie alleageth by 
the witnesse of Cato: whose saying (beecause it is worthy 
and most fit for studentes) I wil recite verbatim. Scipio 
[/64./] 
was wont to say; that hee was neuer more leasurelesse 
then when hee was leasurefull: and neuer lesse alone, 
then when hee was all alone. Of this saying Tullie 
speaketh as followeth. A noble saying surely and meet 
for a worthy and wise man: which declareth, that he 
both in his leasure, was wont to muse of matters to 
be done; and also in his solitarinesse, to debate them 
with himselfe, so as he was nothing idle at any tyme, 
and sometime he needed not the communication of 
[^p.14^] 
other. So those two thinges, leasure and solitarinesse, 
which bring a dulnes vppon other, made him the 
quicker. Leasure then and solitarinesse are two of the 
chiefest thinges apperteyning to studie. Which two who 
so hath obteyned, and is a louer of learning (as Isocrates 
speaketh) let him obserue these rules following: 
 
Mane cito lectum fuge, mollem discute somnum: 
Templa petas supplex &, venerare Deum. 
 
[/65./] 
Those thinges presupposed which I haue spoken of in 
the preparation of exercise of the bodie, this golden lesson 
of Lilie is next to be obserued. And if you goe not to the 
Church, yet forget not to serue God. And for this purpose 
no time is more co~uenient than the morning. Which 
[/66./] 
the Prophet Dauid euerie where witnesseth in his 
Psalmes, namely Psalme fiue, saying my voice shalte 
thou heare betimes o Lord: early in the morning will 
I direct my prayer vnto thee, and will looke vp. And 
for studie howe muche better the morning is than other 
times of the day, the reasons following may declare. First 
of all there bee thee planetes (as the Astronomers teache) 
most fauourable to learning. That is, Sol, Venus, and 
Mercurie, these three in a manner meeting together when 
night approcheth, depart from vs, but when day draweth 
neere they returne and visite vs againe. Wherefore the 
[/67./] 
best time for studie is earlie in the morning, when the 
Planetes be fauourable to our purpose. Againe when the 
Sunne ariseth, the ayre is mooued, and made more cleare 
and subtill, and the bloud and spirites of our bodies doe 
naturally followe the motion and inclination of the ayre. 
Wherefore the morning or sunne rising, is most fit for 
studie. Aristotle therefore in his Oeconomikes, not w~out 
[/68./] 
greate cause biddeth vs to rise before day, and sayeth, that 
it preuaileth greatly both to the health of the bodie, and 
to the studie of Philosophie. Whose counsel that famous 
[/69./] 
Oratour of Greece Demosthenes, diligently followed 
(as Tullie reporteth of him) Demosthenes sayed that 
[^p.15^] 
he was grieued, if artificers at any time did exceede 
him in diligence: whose good example I wish al students 
to folow, hauing alwaies in mind this short sentence. The 
morning is best for studie. And not to imitate y=e= practise 
of Bonacius a young man of whom Poggius the Florentine 
maketh mention. This Bonacius was woont to 
lie long in bed, and when he was rebuked of his felowes 
[/70./] 
for so doing, he answered smyling, that hee gaue eare to 
certaine persons who contended and disputed before him, 
For as soone as I wake (sayde he) there appeareth in the 
shape of women Carefulnesse and slouthfulnesse. Carefulnesse 
biddeth me to rise, and fall to some worke, and 
not to spende the day in my bedde. Contrariwise slouthfulnesse 
biddeth me lie still, and take mine ease, and keepe 
me from colde in my warme couch. Thus while they varie 
and wrangle, I, like an indifferent iudge inclining to 
neither part, lie hearkening and looking when they will 
agree. And by this meanes the day is ouerpassed or I 
beware. This young mans practise I leaue to loytering 
[/71./] 
Lurdeines, and returne againe to diligent studentes, who 
hauing vsed the preparation aforesaied must applie themselues 
earnestlie to reading and meditation for the space 
of an houre: then to remitte a little their cogitation, and 
in the meane time with an Iuorie combe to kembe their 
head from the forehead backewardes about fourty times, 
and to rubbe their teeth with a course linnen cloth. Then 
to returne againe to meditation for two houres, or one at 
the least, so continuing, but alwaies with some intermission, 
vntill toward noone. And sometimes two houres 
after noone, though seldome, except we be forced to eate 
in the meane season, for the sunne is of great power at the 
rising, and likewise being in the middes of the heauens. 
And in that part also which is next to the middes, which 
the Astronomers call the ninth part and the house of wisdome, 
the sunne is of great vertue. Now because the Poetes 
doe account the sunne as captaine of the Muses and 
[^p.16^] 
Sciences, if any thing bee deepely to bee considered, wee 
must meditate thereon especially the houres aforesaide. 
As for the residue of the day is conuenient rather to reuoulue 
[/72./] 
thinges reade before, than to reade or muse of new. 
Alwaies remembred that euerie houre once at the leaste 
we remitte a little while the earnest consideration of the 
minde: neither should wee meditate anie longer than wee 
haue pleasure therein. For all wearinesse is hurtfull to 
health, wearinesse of the bodie is euill, but wearinesse of 
the minde is woorse: and wearinesse of both woorst of all. 
For contrarie motions draweth as it were a man in sunder 
and destroyeth life. But nothing is more hurtfull than 
[/73./] 
studying in the night. For while the Sunne shineth ouer 
vs, through the power therefore the pores of the bodie are 
opened, and the humours and spirites are drawen from 
the inner partes outwarde. And contrariwise, after the 
sunne setteth the bodie is closed vppe, and naturall heate 
fortified within. Wherefore to watch and to be occupied 
[/74./] 
in minde or bodie in the day time, is agreeable to the 
motions of the humours and spirites: but to watch and to 
studie in the night, is to striue against nature, and by contrarie 
motions to impaire both the bodie and minde. Againe, 
by continuall operation of the ayre opening the 
pores, there followeth exhalation and consumption of the 
vital spirites, whereby the stomacke is greatly weakened, 
and requireth a renewing and repayring of the Spirites: 
which may best be doone in the night season when naturall 
heate returneth from without to the inwarde partes. 
Wherefore whosoeuer at that time shall beginne long and 
difficult contemplation, shall of force drawe the spirites 
from the stomacke to the heade, and so leaue the stomacke 
destitute: whereby the head shall bee filled with vapours, 
and the meate in the stomacke for want of heate, shall bee 
vndigested or corrupted. Well therefore sayth Erasmus, 
Night watchinges are thought very perillous. Notwithstanding 
I knowe that such as bee good students indeede, 
[^p.17^] 
hauing always in mind that notable saying of Plinius: 
that all time is lost which is not spent in study, do 
spare no time, neither night nor day from their bookes. 
Whereof Plinie himselfe hath giuen a goodly example, in 
[/75./] 
that by his owne testimonie, hee wrote that most excellent 
worke, called the history of nature, in the night, and at 
odde times: Yea, Galen in his olde age (as he writeth) 
was faine to eate Lettuse boyled, of purpose to make him 
sleepe, because in my youth (sayth he) of mine owne accord 
[/76./] 
I vsed to watch. And again he saith, I surmounted 
al my scholefellows in study, not only in the day time, 
but also in the night. As for pore students, they must folowe 
[/77./] 
the example of Cleanthes, who in the night time by 
drawing of water, got where withall to finde himselfe in 
y=e= day to study Philosophy vnder Chrisippus. Or as that 
excellent Poet Plautus, who was faine (for his liuing) to 
[/78./] 
serue a baker in turning a Querne or handmil, y=t= he might 
yet sometime apply his study. Wherefore let not pore students 
disdaine to do seruice in the day, that they may yet 
imploy sometime in the night. And if they waxe pale with 
ouermuch studie, it is no reproche, but a very commendable 
[/79./] 
signe of a good student. Yet would I haue none to studie 
so much, that thereby they should fall into sicknesse, or 
become melancholike, as Homere writeth of Aiax & Bellerophon. 
Thus much touching the time most conuenient 
for study: Now touching the place moste fit for 
that purpose, I am of Quintilians mind, that to studie 
abroad, where we may haue libertie to looke farre about 
vs, eyther by riuer sides, or in pleasant woods, or 
hilles, where the singing of birds, or the ayre may delight 
vs, is not so good as to study in a quiet close 
place, be it cha~ber, gallerie, or closet. For those things 
which delight, doe rather remit our cogitation, and 
withdraw our intention then procure it. Wherefore, 
Demosthenes vsed to study in such a place where no 
voyce coulde be heard, and where he had no prospect, 
[^p.18^] 
least that his eyes should alienate his minde from his 
present purpose. Whose example may teache all studentes, 
that a close place without noyse, not full of 
light is best to study in: nay, one light (by Quintilians 
iudgement,) is sufficient. And that light which is, 
should not come directly against our faces, for that is 
hurtfull to the sight, but it shoulde come alwayes on 
that side which is contrary to the pen hande. Also, to 
stande at our study, or to leane vpon some pillowe or 
Quishion, as long as wee may well endure it, is much 
better then to sit continually, because by that means, 
the bloud and humours, may haue more easy passage 
to all the parts of the body, and the excrements may 
the better descend: for by much sitting and cold, many 
studentes in their olde age (if happily they liue so 
long) fall to the gout, to the dropsie, and such like. But 
I woulde haue students whether they stand or sit, alwaies 
to reme~ber. That a measure is best in all things. 
And if it happen that we be cloyed with studie, then 
must we fall to recreation, and vse some honest play 
[/80./] 
or pastime: yet so as Tullie prescribeth, We may lawfully 
vse play and pastime, but euen as we sleepe and other 
[/81./] 
restings, at such time as we haue sufficiently ended 
graue and earnest causes, and the very manner of 
our play must not bee dissolute nor vnsober, but honest 
and pleasant. Whereof we haue a notable example 
in Valerius Maximus, of Sceuola that learned Lawyer, 
[/82./] 
who being wearied with lawe matters, was wont to recreate 
his minde with Tenise play, and therein is saide to 
haue excelled. Yet sometimes he played at Dice, and Tables, 
[/83./] 
when he had beene long busied in well ordering the 
lawes of the Citizens, and ceremonies of the Gods. For 
so he sayth, As in earnest matters hee shewed him selfe 
to be Sceuola, so in pastimes he shewed him selfe to be 
a man whome nature hath not made able to abide 
[/84./] 
continuall labour. Likewise, wee reade of Socrates the 
[^p.19^] 
Philosopher, who notwithstanding he was adiudged by 
the Oracle of Apollo, to be the wisest man in the worlde, 
yet for recreation hee blushed not to ride vpon a reede among 
his little children: And when hee was laughed to 
scorne of Alcibiades for so doing, hee answered him very 
[/85./] 
pretily, tell no bodie (sayth he) that thou sawest mee, vntill 
thou haue children of thine owne. As who should say, such 
is the affection of Parentes towardes their children, that 
they are not ashamed oftentimes to play the children with 
them. But of recreation of the body I haue spoken sufficiently 
before, and nowe I will speake somewhat of recreation 
[/86./] 
of the minde. For there be some pastimes that exercise 
the mind onely, as dice, tables, cardes, and such like, which 
because they are accounted vnlawfull games, and forbidden 
euen by heathen writers, as by the sage Cato in his 
[/87./] 
morall precepts, I will omit them: and if any student will 
vse them hee shall not doe it (by mine aduise) yet I will 
rehearse one example of dice playing, because it is famous. 
Caligula the Emperour (as Erasmus reporteth) when he 
[/88./] 
played at dice, gate more by lying and forswearing, than 
by true play. And vpon a time, yeelding his turne of casting 
[/89./] 
vnto his next fellowe, going foorth to the doore, hee 
espied two rich gentlemen of Rome passing by, whome 
straightway hee commaunded to be taken, and their goods 
to be seised to his vse. And so returning againe into the 
house very ioyfull, hee boasted, that he neuer had a more 
luckie cast at the dice. As Caligula gate those gentlemens 
goods, so thinke I all is gotten that is wonne by dicing. 
Therfore I let it passe, and return to my purpose. There 
is an auncient game called the Chesse, which was inuented 
after Polidorus Virgilius, in the yeare of the worlde, 
3635 by a certaine wise man called Xerxes, to mitigate 
[/90./] 
the mindes or heartes of Tyrants. For it declareth to a 
tyrant that maiestie or authoritie, without strength, helpe 
and assistance of his men and subiectes, is casuall, feeble 
and subiect to many calamities. This game is an earnest 
[^p.20^] 
exercise of the minde, and very commendable and conuenient 
for studentes, and may easily bee prouided to bee alwayes 
ready in their chambers. But for a minde wearied 
with studie, and for one that is melancholike, (as the 
[/91./] 
moste part of learned men are) especially those that be excellent, 
[/92./] 
as Aristotle witnesseth, there is nothing more 
comfortable, or that more reuiueth the spirites than Musicke, 
according to that saying of Hessus, 
 
Nam nihil humanas tanta dulcedine mentes, 
Afficit, ac melicæ nobile vocis opus. 
 
And because it is one of the liberall sciences, it ought 
the more to be esteemed of studentes. And that for good 
cause. For by the iudgement of Aristotle, Musicke is 
[/93./] 
one of those foure thinges that ought to bee learned of 
youth in well gouerned common wealthes: and in the 
fourth Chapter of the same booke, hee declareth that musicke 
[/94./] 
is to be learned, not onely for solace and recreation, 
but also because it mooueth men to vertue and good maners, 
and preuaileth greatly to wisedome, quietnesse of 
minde and contemplation. But what kinde of musicke euery 
student shoulde vse, I refer that to their owne inclination. 
Howbeit the examples following may declare, y=t= 
the Harpe of all instrumentes is moste auncient, and 
hath beene in greatest price and estimation. Orpheus 
[/95./] 
that auncient Poet and Harper moste excellent, (as the 
Poets surmised) did with his Musicke delight wilde 
Beastes, as Lyons and Tygres, and made them to followe 
him, and with his sweete harmonie, drewe stones 
and woodes after him, that is to say, mooued and qualified 
the grosse heartes and rude mindes of men. The 
Prophet Dauid, delighted in the Harpe, and with the 
sweete melody thereof, deliuered King Saul from the vexation 
[/96./] 
of the euill Spirite. Marsilius Ficinus speaking 
of himselfe sayeth, I also, (if I may make vnequall comparison) 
[^p.21^] 
doe proue oftentimes at home, how muche 
the sweete tune of the Harpe, and singing, doe preuaile 
against the dumpes of melancholie. And if euerie 
student could playe vppon instruments, it were the more 
commendable. For Themistocles (as Tullie writeth) 
[/97./] 
Because hee refused the Harpe at a feaste, was compted 
vnlearned. And Socrates when he was old, so much 
esteemed of Musicke, that he was not ashamed being old, 
[/98./] 
to learne among boyes to play vpon instruments. And 
how comfortable Musicke is to all sortes of men, we may 
playnely perceiue by labourers, for the galieman, the 
ploughman, the carter, the carier, ease the tediousnesse 
of their labour and iourney with singing and whisteling: 
yea the brute beasts be delighted with songs and noyses, 
as mules with belles, horses with trumpets and shalmes, 
are of a fiercer stomacke to their appointed ministerie. 
Wherefore I counsell all students oftentimes to refreshe 
their wearied minds with some sort of melodie. For so 
shall they driue away the dumpes of melancholie, and 
make their spirites more liuely to learne. And so I ende 
this treatise of labour. 
 
[}Of meate. Chap. 3.}] 
 
AFter labour there followeth in the sentence of Hip. 
Cibus, wherby he giueth vs to vnderstande, that meate 
must be taken after wee haue exercised. The necessitie 
whereof needeth no proofe, considering that nature hath 
[/99./] 
taught all liuing creatures to seeke by sustenaunce to 
maintaine their liues. The infant newe borne seeketh to 
sucke. The lambe, the calfe, the colte, yea the whelpe yet 
blinde gapeth for the dugges of the damme. For such is 
the state of man and beast touching the bodie, that the spirites, 
humors, yea the sounde substance of all partes doe 
continually wast and weare away: So that vnlesse by 
nourishment other like be restored, of necessitie the whole 
[^p.22^] 
must shortly be consumed. For life may wel be compared 
to the matche of a lampe, which if it bee not continually 
fedde with sufficient oyle is soone extinguished. Against 
this necessarie and natural imbecillitie and mortalitie of 
mankinde, God of his infinitie prouidence and goodnesse 
hath prouided foode, whereby to repaire, to restore and 
counteruaile so long as his good pleasure is the continuall 
impairing and decaying of our flesh. Wherefore it behooueth 
vs to haue a speciall care and regarde that wee vse 
such meates as may best nourish our bodies, and in no 
[/100./] 
wise binder our health. Which to perfourme it is necessarie, 
that in meates we consider sixe things. First the substance, 
secondly the quantitie, thirdly the qualitie, fourthly 
custome: fiftly time, sixtly order. These sixe are brieflie 
set downe in Schola Salerni, though not in like order as 
followeth: 
 
Quale, Quid & Quando, Quantum, Quoties, vbi dando: 
Ista notare cibo debet medicus bene doctus. 
 
These six I shall brieflie handle as they are proposed. 
 
[}The Substance of meates.}] 
 
Concerning the substance of meates, some are good 
which make good bloud, and some are ill which engender 
ill bloud. Which difference may easily be perceiued by the 
viewe of the treatise following diuided into three partes 
according to Galen. First I shall speake touching corne 
[/101./] 
or grayne, next touching herbes and fruites, lastly touching 
liuing and sensible creatures, and their partes perteyning 
to dyet. 
 
[}Of Wheate Chap. 4.}] 
 
Of all corne or grayne vsed in diet wheate is the chiefest. 
[/102./] 
Theophrastus describeth diuerse sortes of 
wheate, but the greatest difference in my iudgement is 
in the colour, for some is browner or blacker, and other is 
whiter and fairer. The best kinde of wheate was called in 
olde time Siligo, whereof was made the finest bread called 
[^p.23^] 
Panis Siligineus, which wee call manchet, and was plentifull 
among the Romaines, and other Nations also subiect 
to the Romaine Empire. And although Plinie preferre 
the wheate of Italie before all other, confirming the 
same by the saying of the auncient Poet Sophocles: And 
[/103./] 
to describe Italie so frutefull of white wheate, Yee as 
[/104./] 
I thinke we haue as good wheate in Englande, both red 
and white as may be founde in any Countrie in all Europe, 
and as good bread is made thereof, especially that of 
Yorke, which they call maine bread. Wheate in nature 
[/105./] 
is manifestly hotte, and beeing laide to outwardly in a 
medicine, is hotte in the first degree without any manifest 
[/106./] 
moysture. And touching the choice of wheate which is 
best to make bread withall, Matthiolus perfectly describeth: 
Wheate whereof the best bread is made, shoulde 
[/107./] 
be harde, thick, heauie, yealowe, brighte, full ripe, 
cleane, gowne in a fatte soyle. And if we cannot conueniently 
[/108./] 
prouide wheate that hath all the foresaide properties, 
yet let it be such as Galen requireth. Let it be harde 
wheate, that will not easilie be broken betweene the teeth, 
let it be thicke or close together, not loose or open: Let it be 
[/109./] 
heauie or weightie, let it be of yellowe colour. Of such 
wheate as this, may be made that bread which is best and 
most wholesome for youth and age, which ought to haue 
fiue properties. First it must be wel leauened, for breade 
[/110./] 
without leauen is good for no man. Howebeit in England 
our finest manchet is made without leauen. Next it 
ought to be light, for thereby it is knowen that the clamminesse 
[/111./] 
thereof is gone. Thirdly it ought to be well baked, 
for bread that is ill baked is of ill digestion, and sore 
grieueth the stomacke. Fourthly it must be temperately 
salted, for bread ouersweete is a stopper, and breade ouer 
salt is a drier. The fifth thing is that bread should be made 
of the best wheate, such as I haue spoken of before. 
These fiue properties are briefelie comprised in two verses 
in Schola Salerni. 
 
[^p.24^] 
Panis non calidus, nec sit nimis inueteratus, 
Sed fermentatusq~, oculatus, sit bene coctus, 
Et salsus modice, & frugibus validis electus. 
 
But the first verse conteineth two other notes touching 
bread. The one is, that it ought not to be eaten hotte, because 
it stoppeth much and swimmeth in the stomacke by 
[/112./] 
reason of his vaporous moysture, yet is the sauour of 
newe breade very wholesome, and reuiueth one out of a 
soune, as Arnoldus saith. The other is that we ought not 
to eate bread that is very stale or mouldie, for it dryeth the 
body and ingendreth melancholie humors. Wherevpon 
it followeth that bread to bee best, which is made of pure 
[/113./] 
flowre of good wheate, sufficiently leauened, somewhat 
salted, well moulded, well baked, neither too newe nor too 
old: that is to say, after Doctor Boord, that it be at least a 
day and a night olde, and not past fowre or fiue daies old, 
except the loaues be verie great, which definition Galen 
himselfe vttereth in these wordes: That breade is most 
easilie digested, which is well leuened, and well kneaded 
[/114./] 
or wrought, and well baked. Whereby it appeareth 
that all kinde of breade made without leauen is 
vnwholesome, and after Galen descendeth slowlie from 
[/115./] 
the stomacke, engendreth grosse humors, causeth oppilations 
of the liuer, encreaseth the weakenesse of the splen, 
[/116./] 
and breedeth the stone in the reynes. Wherefore cakes 
of all formes, Simnels, Craucknels, Bunnes, 
Wafers, and other things made of wheate flowre, 
[/117./] 
as Fritters, Pancakes and such like, are by this 
rule reiected. Seeing that wheate meale is not easily 
digested, vnlesse it be laboured with salte, with 
leauen, with mixture, with threshing, and with 
the Ouen. Howbeit nowe adayes common experience 
[/118./] 
prooueth in mens stomackes, that breade much 
leauened is heauie of digestion, and no breade is lighter 
than manchet, which is made of fine flower of 
[^p.25^] 
wheate hauing no leauen. And by the foresayd definition 
all loaues that are not baked in an Ouen, but vpon yrons 
or hotte Stones, or vpon the earth, or vnder hotte ashes, 
are vnwholesome, because they are not not equally baked, 
but burned without and rawe within. And of such 
loaues as are baken in an Ouen, the greatest Loaues doe 
nourish most, after Master Eliot, because the fire hath not 
consumed the moysture of them. But whether Breade 
[/119./] 
be made in forme of Manchet, as is vsed of the gentilitie, 
or in great Loaues, as it is vsed among the Yeomanrie, 
or betweene both, as with the frankelinges, it maketh 
no matter, so it bee well baked. Burned Breade and 
harde Crustes, and Pasty crustes doe engender adust 
[/120./] 
choler, and Melancholye humours, as sayth Schola 
Salerni. 
 
Non comedas crustam, choleram quia gignit adustam. 
 
Wherefore the vtter Crustes aboue and beneath, 
should be clipped away. Notwithstanding after Arnold, 
[/121./] 
the crustes are wholesome for them that bee whole, and 
haue their stomackes moyste, and desire to bee leane, but 
they must eate them after meate, for they must enforce 
the meate to descende, and doe comfort the mouth of the 
[/122./] 
stomacke. Browne breade made of the coursest of Wheat 
flower, hauing in it much branne, and that breade which 
Galen calleth Autopyros, that is, when meale wholly vnsifted, 
branne and all is made into Bread, filleth the belly 
[/123./] 
with the excrementes, and shortly descendeth from the 
stomacke. And beside that it is good for labourers, I haue 
knowne this experience of it, that such as haue beene vsed 
to fine bread, when they haue beene costiue, by eating 
[/124./] 
browne breade and butter haue beene made soluble. But 
wheate is not onely vsed in breade, but beeing sodden, is 
vsed for meate, as I haue seene in sundrie places, and of 
some is vsed to bee buttered. 
 
[^p.26^] 
But Galen himselfe (as hee writeth) trauailing into the 
Country, for want of other foode was faine to eate sodden 
[/125./] 
Wheate in an husbandmans house: but the next day 
after, hee and his mates that had eaten with him, were 
much greeued therby both in stomacke and head. Whereby 
hee concludeth that it is heauy and harde of digestion, 
but being well digested, nourisheth strongly, and strengthneth 
a man much: wherefore it is good for labourers. Of 
Wheate also, is made Alica and Amylum mentioned 
of Galen, things not vsuall among vs. Yet Amylum is 
taken to bee Starch, the vse whereof is best knowen to 
Launders. And Alica Saccharata is taken for Frumentie, 
[/126./] 
a meate verye wholesome and nourishing if it 
bee well made, yet in digestion much like to sodden 
wheate. 
 
As for the Turkie wheate, French wheate, and such 
like straunge grayne, I will ouerpasse them, because they 
[/127./] 
bee not vsuall in our Country of England. Yet of french 
wheate I can say thus much by experience, that in some 
partes of Lankashire and Chesshire they vse to make 
Breade thereof for their houshoulde, beeing mingled together 
with Barley, but for the Winter time onely. For 
when the heate of the yeere encreaseth, it waxeth rancke 
of sauour. Also, therewith they fatte their Swine, for 
which purpose it is greatly commended, and in my iudgement, 
it is more fitte to feede Swine than men. 
More of breade shall be spoken heereafter when I intreat 
of other grayne. 
 
[}Of Rie. Chap. 5}] 
 
SEcale commonly called Rye, a Grayne much vsed in 
Breade, almoste throughout this Realme, though 
[/128./] 
more plentifull in some places, than in other: yet 
the Breade that is made thereof, is not so wholesome 
[^p.27^] 
as wheate breade, for it is heauie and hard to to digest, and 
therefore most meete for labourers, and such as worke or 
trauaile much, and for such as haue good stomackes. 
There is made also of Rie mixed with wheate a kinde of 
breade named misseling or masseling breade, much vsed 
in diuerse Shires, especially among the familie. Which 
being well made after the order prescribed in the treatise 
of wheate, is yet better than that which is made of cleane 
Rie, but that which is halfe Rie and halfe Barlie is 
woorse. Rie laide outwardly to the bodie, is hotte 
[/129./] 
and drie in the seconde degree after Dodonæus, whose 
authoritie I alleage, because Galen hath written little 
or nothing thereof, except Typha be Rie, as Mayster 
Eliot iudgeth it: then is it in a meane betweene Wheate 
and Barlie. 
 
[}Of Barlie. Chap. 6.}] 
 
BArlie, whereof also bread is vsed to be made, but it 
doth not nourish so much as wheate, and after Matthiolus, 
[/130./] 
troubleth the stomacke, maketh colde and 
tough iuyce in the bodie, nourisheth little, and ingendreth 
[/131./] 
winde, yet some affirme that it is good for such as haue 
the gowte. Barlie is colde and drie in the first degree, 
[/132./] 
(and as Galen saith) how soeuer it bee vsed in breade, or 
ptisan, or otherwise, it is of cooling nature, and maketh 
[/133./] 
thinne iuice and somewhat cleansing. And in the tenth 
Chapter of the same booke, hee saith that barlie bread 
passeth very soone from the bellie. As of wheate, so 
likewise of barely there is great choyce to bee had, for 
some is better and some is woorse. Yet all barlie generally, 
considering the nature thereof, is more meete for 
drinke than breade, and thereof is made the best malte to 
[/134./] 
make ale or beere. And though barelie be colde, yet it 
[^p.28^] 
maketh such hotte drinke, that it setteth men oftentimes 
in a furie. 
 
[}Of Oates. Chap. 7.}] 
 
OAts, after Galen, haue like nature as barlie, for they 
[/135./] 
are drie, and digest in a meane, and are of temperature 
somewhat colde, also something binding, so that they 
helpe a laske, which I my selfe haue prooued in cawdles 
made with oatemeale. Yet Galen affirmeth, that 
[/136./] 
Oates are meate for beastes and not for men. Whose 
opinion in that point must bee referred to the Countrie 
where he liued. For if hee had liued in Englande especially 
in Lankashire, Chesshire, Cumberlande, Westmerlande, 
or Cornewale, hee woulde haue saide, that 
Oates had beene meate for men. For in these partes 
they are not onely prouander for horses, but they make 
malte of them, and thereof good ale, though not so 
strong as of barlie malte. Also of oates they make bread. 
Some in cakes thicker or thinner as the vse is. Some 
[/137./] 
in broade loaues, which they call Ianockes, of which 
[/138./] 
kinde of breade I haue this experience, that it is light 
of digestion, but something windie, while it is newe 
it is meetely pleasaunt, but after a fewe daies it waxeth 
drie and vnsauourie, it is not very agreeable for 
such as haue not beene brought vp therewith: for education 
both in diet and all thinges else is of greate force 
to cause liking or mislikinge. In Lankashire as I 
[/139./] 
haue seene, they doe not onely make breade and drinke 
of Oates, but also diuerse sortes of meates. For of 
the greates or grotes as they call them, that is to say of 
Oates first dried and after lightly shaled, being boyled in 
water with salt they make a kinde of meate which they 
[^p.29^] 
call water potage, and of the same boyled in whey, they 
[/140./] 
make whey potage, and in ale, ale potage: meates verie 
wholsome and temperate, and light of digestion: and if any 
man be desirous to haue a tast of them, let him vse the aduise 
of some Lankashyre woman. 
 
[}Of Beanes. Chap. 8.}] 
 
BEane, in cooling and drying is very neere in a meane 
[/141./] 
temperature. Greene beanes beefore they bee ripe 
are colde and moyst: but when they bee drie they haue 
power to binde and restraine. The substance of beanes 
is something clensing, and the huske is somewhat binding. 
[/142./] 
Pythagoras the Philosopher gaue foorth this saying 
as some interprete, absteine from beanes. Because 
they make the sight dull and rayse vp ill dreames (as 
Plinie sayeth.) But how so euer Pythagoras meant it, 
[/143./] 
true is that saying of Galen, be they neuer so long boyled, 
or any waye vsed they are windie. And againe hee 
[/144./] 
sayeth, beanes are a windie meate, and harde to digest. 
Wherefore they are meate for Mowers, as the 
Prouerbe is, and for ploughmen, but not for students. 
[/145./] 
Beeing sodden they are vsed to bee eaten as well greene 
as dry: the greene beanes they vse to butter, the other 
they eate with salt vnbuttered. Of greene beanes Galen 
[/146./] 
giueth this iudgement. If they be eaten greene before 
they bee ripe, the same happeneth to them which 
[/147./] 
happeneth to other frutes which bee eaten before 
they bee full ripe: that is, they geue very moyste 
nourishment to the bodie, and therefore full of 
excrementes, and that not onely in the bowelles, 
but also in the whole habit of the bodie. Also of 
beanes, in Leycester shire they make breade. I meane 
[^p.30^] 
not horse breade) which is commonly doone throughout 
Englande) but for their familie. But it can in no wise 
bee wholsome, beecause it filleth the bodie full of winde: 
Notwithstanding I knowe that such as haue beene 
brought vp therewith doe like it well. So greate a matter 
is it, to vse any thinge from our childhoode. 
 
[}Of Pease. Chap. 9.}] 
 
PIsum, Pease, after Galen are like in substance to 
[/148./] 
Beanes, and eaten after the same maner, yet they differ 
in two thinges. First in that they are not so windie as 
beanes. And next because they bee not so abstersiue or 
[/149./] 
clensing: and therefore they passe more slowly from the 
bellie. There be three sortes of Pease common among 
vs in Englande. The first, garden pease or hastie pease: 
[/150./] 
The seconde sorte is called graie pease: the thirde greene 
pease, both growing in the fieldes. The two first sorts 
are vsed to be eaten greene before they be full ripe. First 
they are sodden, then buttered, salted, and peppered. But 
if any student list to eate greene pease, let him spare no 
[/151./] 
pepper vpon them, for this is a general rule in Galen, for 
meates that be windie, whatsoeuer windinesse there is 
in meates, it is corrected by thinges which heate and 
[/152./] 
extenuate. Pease are commended in Schola Salerni on 
this wise: 
 
Pisam laudandam delegimus ac reprobandam: 
Pellibus ablatis sunt bona pisa satis, 
Sunt inflatiua cum pellibus atque nociua. 
 
That is, they bee wholsome to eate when the huskes 
be taken away, for if they bee eaten in the huskes they 
bee hurtfull and doe inflate. But howe they should bee 
eaten without the huske I doe not knowe, except it bee 
[^p.31^] 
in Pottage: for they are wont to bee blaunched as Almondes, 
but there is made of them a kinde of broth or 
[/153./] 
potage called Pease potage. Some make it with pease 
boiled whole, but that is not good. Other streine the pease 
after they be boyled, and that is best. And this kinde of 
potage is commended of Arnoldus, vpon the sayde verses, 
[/154./] 
for it maketh (sayth he) the belly laxatiue, and procucureth 
vrine, and vnstoppeth the veynes. Wherefore it is 
wholesome at such times as folkes vse grosse and oppilatiue 
meates, as on fasting dayes. And in England it is vsed 
[/155./] 
accordingly, for commonly pease potage is most eaten 
in Lent. If pease bee vnwholsome, then the bread which 
is made of it is vnwholsome, yet is it much vsed in Leycester 
shire. But I leaue it to Rustickes, who haue stomackes 
like Ostriges, that can digest hard yron. And for 
studentes I alowe no breade but that which is made of 
wheat as before is mentioned. 
 
[}Of Rice. Chap. 10.}] 
 
ORisa Rice, after Galen is something binding, and 
[/156./] 
therefore stoppeth or bindeth the bellie. And agayne 
he sayth: All men vse this graine to stoppe the bellie: 
[/157./] 
and they boyle it as Alica, yet is it more hardly digested 
and nourisheth lesse, and is not so pleasaunt in eating. 
But wee vse to make a kinde of Potage with Rice, called 
[/158./] 
Rice potage, which beeing well made with good milke, 
and spiced with Sugar and Cinamom, is very pleasaunt 
and easie of digestion, and restoratiue. For thus writeth 
Matthiolus, There bee some that say, that Rice increaseth 
[/159./] 
nature, beeing boyled in milke, with sugar 
and Cinamom. And in the same place he sayth, that it is 
very good to bee eaten in any kinde of laske or fluxe, especially, 
beeing first dried and after boyled in mylke, wherein 
[^p.32^] 
hotte stones haue beene quenched. But if any list to 
[/160./] 
make Rice potage properly for a fluxe, they may be made 
in this manner. Take a good handfull of oken barke, and 
boyle it in a gallon of running water to the halfe or more. 
Then streine it and let it coole, then take halfe a pounde 
of Iorden almondes, and beate them in a morter with the 
hulles and all on, after streine them with the foresayde 
water, and so with Rice, make rice potage. Rice may bee 
beaten with Almonde milke, and so it doth restore and 
comfort nature. Hitherto I haue entreated of such graine 
as is vsuall among vs in breade and meates, as for other 
[/161./] 
sortes named of Galen Legumina, in English pulse, as 
fetches, tares, fengreeke and such like I ouerpasse them, 
because they are not vsed as sustenance for man, but for 
medicine, or else as fodder for beastes. And nowe shall I 
speake of herbes and fruites. I meane of those that appertaine 
to diet, and as they bee vsed for meate, and not 
for medicine. For that belongeth to another part of phisicke, 
though I know that there may be as Hippocrates 
sayeth, medicinable meate. Which thing, as occasion 
shall serue, I will briefly touch for the behalfe of students. 
And of herbes I shall declare first such as be hotte, and 
after those that be colde.
