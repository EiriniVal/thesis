THere is a wisdome in this, 
beyond the Rules of Physicke: 
A Mans owne Obseruation, 
what he findes 
Good of, and what he 
findes Hurt of, is the best Physicke to preserue 
Health. But it is a safer Conclusion 
to say; This agreeth not well with me, therefore 
I will not continue it; Then this; I 
finde no offence of this, therefore I may vse 
it. For Strength of Nature in youth, passeth 
ouer many Excesses, which are owing 
a Man till his Age. Discerne of the 
comming on of Yeares, and thinke not, 
to doe the same Things still; For Age will 
not be Defied. Beware of sudden Change 
in any great point of Diet, and if necessity 
[^p.188^] 
inforce it, fit the rest to it. For it is a Secret, 
both in Nature, and State; That it is 
safer to change Many Things, then one. 
Examine thy Customes, of Diet, Sleepe, 
Exercise, Apparell, and the like; And trie 
in any Thing, thou shalt iudge hurtfull, 
to discontinue it by little and little; But 
so, as if thou doest finde any Inconuenience 
by the Change, thou come backe to 
it againe: For it is hard to distinguish, that 
which is generally held good, and wholesome, 
from that, which is good particularly, 
and fit for thine owne Body. To be 
free minded, and cheerefully disposed, at 
Houres of Meat, and of Sleep, and of Exercise, 
is one of the best Precepts of Long 
lasting. As for the Passions and Studies 
of the Minde; Auoid Enuie; Anxious 
Feares; Anger fretting inwards; Subtill 
and knottie Inquisitions; Ioyes, and Exhilarations 
in Excesse; Sadnesse not Communicated. 
Entertaine Hopes; Mirth rather 
then Ioy; Varietie of Delights, rather 
then Surfet of them; Wonder, and Admiration, 
and therefore Nouelties; Studies 
[^p.189^] 
that fill the Minde with Splendide 
and Illustrious Obiects, as Histories, Fables, 
and Contemplations of Nature. If 
you flie Physicke in Health altogether, it 
will be too strange for your Body, when 
you shall need it. If you make it too familiar, 
it will worke no Extraordinary Effect, 
when Sicknesse commeth. I commend 
rather, some Diet, for certaine Seasons, 
then frequent Vse of Physicke, Except 
it be growen into a Custome. For 
those Diets alter the Body more, and trouble 
it lesse. Despise no new Accident, in 
your Body, but aske Opinion of it. In 
Sicknesse, respect Health principally; And 
in Health, Action. For those that put their 
Bodies, to endure in Health, may in most 
Sicknesses, which are not very sharpe, be 
cured onely with Diet, and Tendering. 
Celsus could never have spoken it as a 
Physician, had he not been a Wise Man 
withall; when he giueth it, for one of the 
great precepts of Health and Lasting; 
That a Man doe vary, and enterchange 
Contraries; But with an Inclination to 
[^p.190^] 
the more benigne Extreme: Vse Fasting, 
and full Eating, but rather full Eating; 
Watching and Sleep, but rather Sleep; 
Sitting, and Exercise, but rather Exercise; 
and the like. So shall Nature be cherished, 
and yet taught Masteries. Physicians are 
some of them so pleasing, and conformable 
to the Humor of the Patient, as they 
presse not the true Cure of the Disease; 
And some other are so Regular, in proceeding 
according to Art, for the Disease, as 
they respect not sufficiently the Condition 
of the Patient. Take one of a Middle 
Temper; Or if it may not be found in 
one Man, combine two of either sort: And 
forget not to call, aswell the best acquainted 
with your Body, as the best reputed 
of for his Faculty.
