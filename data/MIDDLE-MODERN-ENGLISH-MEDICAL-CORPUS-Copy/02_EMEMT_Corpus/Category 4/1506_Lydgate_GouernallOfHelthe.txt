[^Lydgate, John: Gouernall of helthe^] 
 
[}Here 
begynneth 
a lytell treatyse 
called the gouernall 
of helthe With y=e= 
medecyne of y=e= 
stomacke.}] 
 
[^Extract 1, ff. A1v-B6r^] 
 
[^f.A1v^] 
[^A picture of four men omitted. The first is posing, the second is drawing his portrait, the third is sculpting and the fourth is looking at the heaven.^] 
 
IN this treatyse that is clypped gouernall of 
helth. What is to be sayd with crystes helpe 
of some thynges y=t= longe to bodely helth had 
& to be kepte or to bodyly helth lost & to be recouered 
& is departed in .viii. chapytres y=t= is 
to say. In the fyrste chapytre of the profyte of good 
gouernall of helth. In the seconde chapytre what is 
fyrst on morowe to be done. In the iii. chapytre of 
bodyly exercyse y=t= is to say besynes & his profyte. In 
the fourth chapytre of spyces of exercyse. In the fyfthe 
chapytre how a man sholde behaue hym in mete etynge. 
In the syxth chapytre how a man sholde behaue 
hym in drynkynge of his drynkes. In the seuenth 
chapytre what sholde be done after mete. In 
the .viii. chapytre of the noyse of euyll gouernaunce. 
 
[^f.A2r^] 
IT nedeth hym that wyll haue longe lyfe to knowe 
the craft of holsom gouernaunce. And so for 
to kepe contynuelly the helthe of his body/ for elles he 
may not come to his naturall ende/ but he shall dye or 
his kyndly tyme come/ and therfore thus sayth Galye~ 
the connynge. He sayth of holsome gouernaunce is 
meruaylous/ for it maketh a ma to lyue tyll he be olde 
and without sykenes in the last of his olde aege. Therfore 
the same Galyen after that he knewe the craft of 
holsome gouernaunce/ came neuer in to no sykenesse 
but selde/ that was into a fymera~ that is to say a sharpe 
feuer & that was for trauayll in vysytynge of his 
frendes/ aboute the comyn profyte/ for thus he sayth/ 
I take god to recorde & his au~gelles assygned to kepe 
me that who that wylfully and besyly wyll studye 
in y=e= treatyse of holsom gouernau~ce & wyll kepe all hole 
y=e= doctryne therof he shall neuer dye but on & vpon 
kyndly deth whiche deth is swete & softe without grete 
payne as the same Galyen wytnesse the in the dyfference 
of feuerys. But vnderstonde y=t= holsom gouernau~ce 
may not duely kepe that moest nedes be occupyed wyl 
hym or nyll hym and may not whan hym nedeth leue 
of for thy it nedeth hym that he haue that nedeth hym 
to his lyfe without trauayll and pencyfull and in all 
thynges that he be of free condycyon. And ferthermore 
it is to wete that .viii. thynges at the leest ben nedefull 
in holsome gouernaylle of the whiche the fyrste is 
a dyscrete chose of thoo thynges that shall be eeten or 
dronken. The seconde is welfull bodyly exercyse 
to foore meete and that tyll the swetynge begynne/ 
or namely tyll his wynde chaunge fro sloughe to swetenesse. 
The thyrde is well profytable and welle nedefull 
[^f.A2v^] 
that all that shall be eten be wele and small chewed. 
The fourth is that thou ete whyle thou hast talent 
to ete. The .v. is y=t= thou speke on morow tyll y=u= wake 
by thyne owne wyll/ for as Arystotle sayth not only 
in metes & drynkes be we nourysshed and fostred but 
also in slepe. The .vi. is y=t= thou take no mete & drynke 
in sorowe ne in care but in Ioye as moche as y=u= may 
The .vii. is that thou haue ne holde no colde in wynter 
ne in somer after blode letynge. The .viii. is that thou 
vse saffron in thy mete/ for it quyckeneth kyndly hete 
and comforteth thy dysgestyon and taryeth thyne olde 
aege and bryngeth in gladnes & letteth thyne humors 
fro rotynge and dryenge. 
 
IT is in storyes of our elders y=t= on a tyme a myghty 
kynge brought togyder thre of the beste leches 
that myght be/ of Ynde/ of Mede/ and of Grece. 
and he commau~ded them that eche of them sholde study 
to assygne y=e= beste medycyne whiche yf a man wolde 
vse sholde profyte hym to helpe of body & hym sholde 
nede none other medycyne. Truly the leche of Grece 
assygned and sayd that euery day a man to take .ii. 
his mouth full of hote water/ sholde make a man soo 
hole that hym sholde nede none other medycyne. And 
the leche of Mede assygned and sayd that it sholde profyte 
moche euery day fastynge to take gromel sede/ & 
I say sayd Arystotle y=t= he that slepeth so moche that he 
hath no heuynesse in his wombe of mete y=t= he toke to fore 
hy~ dare not drede of ony grete sykenes ne of y=e= gout 
Also who that eteth euery day erly seuen dragmes y=t= 
is to saye .xxi. peny weyghte of swete reysyns he dare 
not drede of flewmy sykenes & his mynde shalbe ame~ded 
and his vnderstondynge shall be slere/ and who y=t= 
[^f.A3r^] 
vseth in the tyme accordynge to his complexyon may 
be sure & drede not of the feuer quarteyne. Also who 
that etethe nottes & fygges w=t= a fewe leues of rewe y=t= 
day shall no venym hym noye. It was axed of Galye~ 
what medycyne were moost profytable & he answered 
abstynence. And co~stantyne sayth in his boke y=t= hyght 
vyatyk y=t= who so wyll kepe his co~tynuell helth kepe his 
stomak so y=t= whan hym nedeth mete leue it not ne take 
nomore therof than hym nedeth/ & the same vndersto~de 
of drynke/ also in holsom gouernau~ce sleeth/ wrath 
grete thought/ heuynes/ angre & suche other. For al 
ghostly accydentes y=t is to say sodeyne fallynge in to a 
ma~nes mynde outaken Ioye alonly drye & that moysteth 
netheles some heteth as wrath/ for thy wrath profyteth 
to flewmatyk men and it harmeth cleryk men. 
Moreouer it is to wete y=t= in lente season/ y=t= is to say in 
veer & in the begynnynge of somer chyldren be well at 
ease after the lykenes of tempred qualytes but other 
aeges ben well at ease in contraryous tymes as olde 
men in somer & yonge men in wynter/ also in holsome 
gouernau~ce kepe this rule yf thou wylte be hole & sou~de/ 
flee heuy charges be not wroth/ soupe not to late/ & 
fle vnder mele slepe wake after mete and eschew & spare 
strong drynkes & namely of wyne: hyde not thy pysse/ 
nor constrayne the not to syege/ kepe well these thre 
thynges/ gladnes in mynde/ trauayle in mesure/ & rule 
of mete/ and drynke as thou wolde/ ete boldly in wy~ter/ 
and in veer scarsly/ and in somer mesure wel thy 
metes/ and flee namely fruytes of auguste. Arystotle 
wrytynge to greate Alexandre and sayd syth to man 
is a bretyll body me semethe I sholde wryte vnto the 
some profytable thynge of lechecrafte yf thou wylte he 
[^f.A3v^] 
sayd besyly beholde the ensample of holsom gouernau~ce 
and lyue after this precyous ordre of dyet ye shall 
nede no leche out take accydentes of batayll/ & suche 
other/ what is fyrst on morowe to be done 
 
AFter that a man hath well and peasybly fulfylled 
his slepe loke he ryse & clothe hymselfe with 
good cloth and swete yf he haue them/ then he owethe 
to walke a lytell euenly to stretche out his lymmes & 
kembe his heed for why kembynge draweth out y=e= vapours 
y=t= come fro the stomak to y=e= heed in tyme of slepe/ 
& therwith loke that ye be besye to put out y=e= superfluytes 
of y=e= body in syegynge pyssynge coughyng and 
spyttynge/ then loke he wasshe his handes & his face in 
somer with colde water/ & in wynter with hote water. 
Then loke he praye & prayse his lorde after his doctryne 
of his lawe/ & vysyte the poore in god/ then yf he lyke 
hym he sholde studye or rede dyspute or talke and 
wyse mennes cou~ceyll saynge besyly here & in mesure 
be mery & flee vtterly wrath & sorowe in asmoche as 
he may/ & vse hymselfe mesurably to trauayle as walkynge 
or rydynge & in clene hyghe places fro myre & 
marros/ for this profyteth moche for it breketh wynde 
in a mannes body & strengeth & lengeth his lymmes 
& comforteth the hete of the stomack and strengeth his 
Ioyntes/ and melteth euyll humours. 
 
[}Of the body exercyse and of his profyte.}] 
 
WE owen vnto know by actours of lechecrafte 
that tho that shall lyue fayre and well in holsom 
gouernaunce/ ought to haue euyn and te~pered 
exercyse to fore mete for that gyueth to all the 
body tempered hete euyn and not passynge/ whiche 
sholde a mannes exercyse be/ a phecysyen dyscryueth 
[^f.A4r^] 
thus. Exercyse is a wylfull meuynge by whiche a mannes 
wynde is made grete & oft it nedeth y=t= this trauayl 
be wylfull/ & not stressed by nede but that he be all fre 
and werke after his owne wyll. And therfore laboure 
of carpenters & plowmen masones maryners & suche 
other is none exercyse of lechecrafte/ for it hath not properly 
wylfull meuynge/ marchauntes truely burgeys 
cloysterers & suche other walkynge well & longe/ but it 
is not properly exercyse of lechecrafte. But whanne a 
man walketh frely of his owne wyll/ & soo swyftly tyll 
he begynne to faynt & his wynde chau~ge/ then anone 
he sholde reste/ for yf he meuyd ony ferther/ it sholde be 
payne & fayntnesse/ & suche exercyse is cleped tempred 
for therby growe many godes to ma~nes body fyrst for 
therby is y=e= kyndly hete stre~gthed & eche & so ben other 
four vertues y=t= is to say/ vertu drawynge/ vertu defyenge/ 
vertu witholdynge/ and vertu out puttynge and 
so ben there .v. bodely wyttes/ y=t= is to say/ herynge/ seynge/ 
smellynge/ tastynge/ & felynge/ & so be~ ther thre 
myndly vertues/ y=t= is to say/ maginityf dyscretyf & memoratyf. 
And though erroure happed in all these werkynges 
of lechecrafte so it were not to notable & exercyse 
were as sholde be sholde neuer mannes body nede other 
medecyne/ for exercyse fulfylleth y=e= defautes of al 
other/ for they be not mery y=t= drede blodeletty~ge & such 
other/ but by exercyse may be heled netheles .ij. thy~ges 
ben nedefull to euery well exercysed y=t= is to say y=t= he be 
not to full ne to empy to full then wolde the humours 
louse and so were grete drede of the lyuer or som feuer 
or sodeyne dethe for thy in suche a case loke that there 
be longe dyscrete abstynence so that he be not to empty 
for than sholde his body be feble out of mesure and at 
[^f.A4v^] 
the laste for feblenes it must nedys lose/ therfore who 
that is to empty it nedeth y=t= he labour not tyll he be more 
& better releued. Truly auctours sayen y=t= exercyse 
is one of the hyghest & noblest thy~ge y=t= may be done 
of to mannes body & full nedefull it is in gouernall of 
helth & lengthynge of lyfe for why exercyse fulfylleth 
the medecynes of blodes & bathynges and suche other 
thynges/ & therin is no drede nor bytternes ne expenses/ 
but therin is pure recreacyon of body & of soule so 
it be done in clene places/ and than sholde men shewe 
themselfe to the clene ayer & delyte in seynge ferre & nere. 
water & londe/ heuen & erth/ grene & falowe And 
in all these he sholde prayse and worshyp our lorde god 
Fulgens dyscryuyth exercyse in a full manere thus 
sayenge exercyse is true kepynge of mannes lyfe and 
prycke of kynde slepynge & the fylth of foule colour & 
tendynge of slothes hete & wastynge of superfluytes & 
saddynge of lymmes & sleynge of sykenesses & dryuynge 
awaye of vyces medycyne of langores wy~nynge of 
tyme & dette of youth & Ioye of olde or age & helpe of 
helth enemye of ydelnes and dystroyenge of all euyll. 
But amonge all other thynges it is to wyte that exercyse 
mesureth mesurably heteth a mannes blode & 
dryeth it. And therfore mesurable flumatyke men sholde 
vse it & rest coleth a man & moysteth hym & that is 
good for coleryke men for thy he alone draweth hy~selfe 
from exercyse y=t= wolde fayne fayle Ioye and felycyte in 
this lyf. Galyen sayth y=t= grete purgacyons & vomytes 
sholde not be taken but selden & for grete nede for why 
Who so wyll eche moneth ones or twyes gretly purge 
hymselfe he shall bryng his body to many euyl vses 
for he shall enge~dre theri~ many noyons humours for 
[^f.A5r^] 
why eche day exercyse is fulled full to kepe a mannes 
helth for who y=t= eteth or drynketh moche/ maye not be 
hole but yf he wyll so~what slepe & swynke. Then these 
thynges y=t= be sayd it sheweth y=t= mesured exercyse hath 
many profytes for it/ styreth y=e= kyndly hete & openeth 
the poores/ & louseth colde and thycke tough humours 
And whan they ben loused bereth them out at the poores 
& maketh a ma~nes ioyntes slypper & lyght & it co~forteth 
all the membres of a mannes body. Wherfore 
noyous humours ben more holsomly pourged & mesured 
by exercyse than by laxatyues or vomytees/ for 
nother of them may be without empeyrement of kynde/ 
and ryght as due kepynge of kyndly exercyse is nedefull/ 
so other whyle is reste. For why reste in asmoch 
as it is contrary to exercyle/ some is bodyly/ some is 
ghostlye/ of whiche eche eyther yf it be mesured after 
that kynde wolde it is heleful both to the body and soule/ 
and yf it be not so it is contrarye. For why yf reste 
be to moche it enge~dreth nouryssheth and multypleth 
euyll humours and encreaseth moche corrupcyon. 
For why whan water restethe to moche it sty~keth/ so 
Iron and eche metall rusteth whan it resteth. 
 
[}The spyces of exercyse.}] 
 
SPyces of exercyse ben there well many as there 
ben dyuerse states of persones/ some ben stro~ge 
and some be feble/ some ryche and some poore/ and 
some prelates at the large and some subgeetes and enclosed 
& so~tyme weder is fayre & clere & so~tyme not soo 
but derke & rayne/ & therfore it nedeth to haue spyces 
of exercyse for why y=e= best spyce & y=e= fyrst is to walk to fore 
mete in hyghe places and clene. Another spyce is to 
[^f.A5v^] 
ryde & that is for ryche men/ but grete prelates muste 
haue other maner of exercyse for why in chambre shal 
be a grete corde knytted in the ende & hanged vp/ and 
take that corde with both hondes and stonde vpryght 
soo that thou touche not the erthe and stonde a good 
whyle then rynne as moche as thou mayste heder and 
theder with that corde and other whyle skyppe/ and yf 
this please the not haue a stone of .xxx.ii. weyght or there 
aboute and yf thou wylte haue helth therin ofte bere 
that stone fro that one syde of the house to that other 
syde/ or a longe whyle holde vp that stone or thou let 
it downe or bere it aboute thy necke/ or bythene thyn 
ho~des/ and so of other maners tyll thou faynt or thus 
holde a staffe in thy honde & lette another take it from 
the yf he may with euen draught/ or thus close a peny 
in thyne honde and lete an other take it yf he maye or 
thus holde thy breth as longe as thou mayst and then 
puffe it out as herde as thou mayst doo. And this 
maner of exercyse is full prouffytable to put out noyous 
superfluytees/ for why many superfluytees in slepe 
ben witholde~ therfore yf thou haue none other maner 
of exercyse holdynge of brethe helpeth it moche. 
Yet there ben other maners of exercyse for yonge 
men that ben lysty as to renne/ to wrastle/ to lepe/ too 
caste the stone/ and so of other playes/ also tempred 
fresshely companynge with a yonge broune woman is 
good in wynter/ and with a yonge whyte woma~ is gode 
in somer & is also good and helpynge in gouernyng 
of helth to boby but not to soule/ excepte to them than 
that mowen haue it by goddes lawes so netheles that 
there be so moche tyme bytwene y=t= he fele hy~self eased 
& lyghtned in his body and that he ete the better and 
[^f.A6r^] 
slepe the better. But therwith vnderstonde that asmoche 
as helpeth tempred compaynyenge soo moche noyeth 
dystempred companyenge and namely to moche 
for it coleth hym wasteth hym & febleth hym. For why 
mannes kynde is made of y=e= beste blode and best defyed 
that hastely may torne in to mannes lymmes. And 
for why whan a man casteth out that noble humours 
to moche he is hugely dyosclored and his body moche 
febled more then he lete four sythes soo moche blode 
oute of his body/ also who that moche deleth or companyeth 
flesshly with a woman lyghtly catcheth the palsey 
with more euyll. 
 
[}How a man sholde behaue hym in etynge.}] 
 
WHan a man hathe welle exercysed hym as it is 
sayd tofore/ rest a whyle after and whan a lytell 
fresshe whete brede well baked and somdele 
soured then drynke a draught of good clere wyne or 
other good sauery drynke then rest a whyle after & study 
in some wyse meanes the~ haue som solace & myrth 
w=t= thy frendes & with other honest co~pany. Then aye~st 
euyn take thy mete and supper moost sauourly but yf 
thy custome be there agaynst. But generall rule of all 
fysyke and leches/ is that thyn houre of etynge be wha~ 
y=u= arte ky~dly hu~gry/ & tofore ye hu~gre ete not/ but yf it 
be a lytel messe of good werme mete to prouoke thy~ appetyte 
with & whan thou hast appetyte let not/ for as 
a fecysyon sayth the stomak out of vse to suffer hunger 
fulfylleth y=e= body of roten humours. And then wyl 
a ma~nes body wex noughty humours/ bycause y=t= the 
colere is drawe~ to y=e= mouh of stomak/ so y=t= aft~ward wha~ 
he wolde ete he may not. Ferthermore it is to wytte y=t= 
[^f.A6v^] 
no man sholde ete but he knewe certaynly his stomacke 
voyde of that thynge that he ete to fore/ & that shall 
a man knowe by desyre that he hath to ete/ & by plente 
of spyttynge comynge vp to his mouthe. For who y=t= 
eteth without desyre of his mete shall fynde the kyndely 
hete of his stomacke colde/ & he that eteth with desyre 
he shall fynde kyndely his stomacke gyue vp a smel 
and sauoure lyke ensence/ by these & suche other sholde 
be vnderstonde of theym that haue mete ordeyned 
at theyr owne wyll/ and who that wyll not ete whan 
som euer that he myghte haue mete for they ben not 
bounden to the lawes of this crafte dyatory as to the 
qualytees of the metes/ vnderstonde that thylke mete 
whiche that moost gouerneth thyn helthe sholde not be 
passynge in ony qualyte/ for why/ metes that ben to hote 
brenne the blode as peper/ garlyk/ ouyons/ cresses/ 
sauge/ myntes percely/ and suche other/ and tho metes 
that ben to colde fresen the blode/ as letuse/ pursylam/ 
gourdes & suche other. And yf thy metes ben to 
watry then they rote the blode/ as ben melons/ cocumbres/ 
& yf thy metes ben to drye it throweth out thyne 
vytayle vertues & yf thy metes ben to fatte they lette 
thy dysgestyon and yf thy metes ben to swete they stope 
y=e= and make the constypute & costyffe & thy metes 
ben bytter they nourysshe the not. And yf thy metes 
be to salte they brenne noye & breke thy stomak and yf 
thy metes ben to soure they make y=e= sone olde. For thy 
none of these metes moche & contynuelly vse is good 
to helth of mannes body but only that mete is good y=t= 
is te~pored & lacketh to mykelnesse as be~ these good metes 
for helth of ma~nes body & holso~ la~be or yonge kyddes 
souky~g calues he~nes capo~s cheky~s p~tryches plouers 
[^f.B1r^] 
fesau~tes smale byrdes of y=e= felde and of the wode 
but not of the water. And whan the season cometh yo~ge 
rabottes & pygges feet ben good & other extremytees 
as groye~ and eres & scaled fysshe of clene rennynge 
water Rere eyren or egges. Also borage oxe tonges 
whete brede well bake & wel lauyned & somdele salted 
of y=t= that is one day olde or tweyne & of other that ben 
not to moche passynge in ony qualyte & yf we drede excesse 
of ony qualyte amende it by the contrary therof 
an insample yf y=u= be seke of euyll and toughe metes vse 
therfore sharpe metes & shorte as a lytell of harde chese 
scraped small and of lytell quantyte/ & also a pere or 
two or thre of the moost best fruyte to thy complexion 
& nature. Sothly salte metes soure and bytter may be 
ame~ded with swete apples swete metes ben amended 
with swete hony and good olde wyne & so of all other 
and yf thou wylte ete frute ete them fast cheryse/ grapes 
and almondes and after mete a fewe peres quynces 
and nottes a fewe whyle they ben grene and walnottes 
ben best but let y=e= skynne be clene pycked away 
fro the mete. Also the complexyon of a man sholde be 
loked to as yf he be tempred kepe hym so with lyke metes 
and drynkes and yf it be dystempred by his contrarye 
brynge it lytell and lytle ayen to tempre and for 
why to sangweyn men dystempred gyue malyncolyous 
metes and to malyncolyous men sangweyn metes 
& to flewmatyk men/ colered metes/ for euery euyl 
complexion may be brought to tempre. But yf necessaryes 
of lyuelode let it. And knowe wha~ y=u= wylte & note 
it for a souerayne notabylyte/ who y=t= eteth ofte mylk & 
fysshe ofte katche therof a lepre or a whyte scabbe. Also 
oft to vse hye coloured wyne & mylke togyd~ bri~geth 
[^f.B1v^] 
a man to both lepre and scabbe/ here none suffyseth of 
qualyte of metes as to the quantyte/ vnderstond that 
thy mete ne thy drynke sholde be no more/ but as thy 
kyndly helthe myghte ouercom it elles/ thy body shall 
wast & thy vertues vexe feble. And for the quantyte of 
metes drynkes may not certenly be spewed loke how 
thou felyst it hath done the moost good and suche qua~tyte 
vse. Ferdermore vnderstonde that no man sholde 
ete anone after his exercyse ne anone after he were 
bathed/ but fyrste rest hym a whyle so that he hungre 
& thenne whan he wyll ete yf he be a ryche man set tofore 
hym many meetes of whiche y=t= one is better than 
that other For a fecysyon sayth it shal better saue hym 
& beter nourysshe hym & skyll why for mete y=t= is taken 
with delyte the stomacke hugely coueyteth hastely katcheth 
longe holdeth & well defyeth & that mete that is 
best defyeth is moost nourysshynge for mannes body. 
Truly other mete y=t= is not defyed is taken with fulso~nes 
& defyeth not well/ for why a man desyre more moton 
the~ a capon y=e= moton shall rather be eten & so of all 
other metes. But there y=t= is moche dystaunce in qualyte 
of metes we may not doo thus & also beware y=t= it be 
none erraunt appetyte as in women y=t= ben with chylde 
& though it otherwhyle be ye shall it not alway be denyed. 
Ferthermore as Galyen sayth y=t= at one mele me~ 
sholde not ete dyuers metes & therfore at morowe ete 
but brede alone & at euen flesshe alone for whan two dyuers 
metes ben take at one male of the~ come two euylles 
one in eyther by it selfe a nother in them both togyder 
in themselfe for then one trauayleth to torne in to 
grete and heuy humours and that other in to subtyll 
and lyght in them both for if subtyll mete go before it 
[^f.B2r^] 
is fyrst defyed and goeth forth and draweth with hy~ 
the grete metes vndefyed and yf the grete metes goo 
fyrste to fore than the sybtyll mete is not medefyed & 
may not for the grete go forth & so it wexeth corrupte 
And whiche of these maners euer it be alway it is euyll 
but more euyll it is that the subtyll folowe the grete for 
the chaufynge/ and chaungynge in to kynde of raunes 
may be holpen/ but the chaungynge in to corrupcyon 
neuer or selden and of wonder harde is holpen. And 
therto accordeth Galyen a fycysyon & other doctours 
but neuertheles peraduenture a contraryous custome 
longe vsed may do awaye the corrupcyon. Also 
wete well that vertue of defyenge is ofte broken whan 
rawe mete is put on halfe soden for thone rawnes sheueth 
out the other & so the halfe soden is corrupte. Moreouer 
that no man ete so moche y=t= the stomak be euyed 
therwith ne that his appetyte cease. But who y=t= vseth 
grete exercyse and to moche & selde and therwith eteth 
vnruly and contyneth it he shall dye by sodeyn dethe 
or shall fele wycked syknes ye thoughe his mete were 
ryght good for by cause his degestyon is corrupte therfore 
kepe well thy stomak from to moche mete & drynke. 
And it so myshap ony tyme anone with water and 
oyle of suche other spue it out anone/ and than slepe 
and yf thou may not slepe walke softely vp and downe 
and .xxiiii. houres ete not after/ ne drynke not than ete 
a lytell with a draught of good clene wyne so the wyne 
be not to grete ne of hyghe colour & on the thyrde daye 
haue some exercyse & be bathed than ete a lytell after & 
after slepe & thou may than vse this electuare dyatryon 
as sayth a fycysyon. Two cause be of sykenesses y=t= is 
dyuerse metes & longe sytty~ge & moche ety~ge of dyuerse 
[^f.B2v^] 
metes for of them ben gendred dyuers humours some 
good & some euyll longe syttynge for then the mete 
y=t= is fyrste take is defyed or the laste begynne to defye 
and so that is defyed draweth with hym to y=e= lyuer 
y=t= is vndefyed and so these two ben cause of grete sykenesses. 
Also as olde wyse men saynge/ ma~ shold neuer 
ete his fyll at one mele in takynge dyuers metes for as 
a wyseman sayth no thynge is worse than to multeply 
metes & so to sytte longe therat for thy he sayth y=t= men 
in olde tyme were satysfyed at morowe w=t= brede alone 
& ther w=t= they sayd resonably the more mete sholde be 
towarde euyn/ but the custome were contrary for auycenne 
sayth y=t= hole men sholde better ete at ayenst nyght 
then on morowe for the kyndly hete is closed w=t=in 
the~ & gadereth about y=e= bowelles/ netheles flewmatyk 
me~ ete not to cold for they nede but lytel exercise to meue 
her ky~dly hete whiche mo weete by the morow But 
now the moost vsage is here agayne & amonge many 
men it is fou~de more holso~ to ete by day then by nyght 
& parauenture y=t= is skyll of custome And therfore thus 
sayth a wyse man short souper & lyght souper is selde~ 
greuous grete soupers noyen as leches teche we rede 
it ofte openly also as a uycenne sayth bytwene two etynges 
.xi. houres to be is p~fytable & so ete thryes in 
two dayes as to daye twyes and to morowe but ones 
and so to contynue forth so y=t= yf errour fall in twyes etynge/ 
and soo agaynwardefor that one must be ame~ded 
by that other sythe it is harde tolyue without errour 
in moreouer vnderstonde that men that haue 
good vnderstondynge/ etyngefor they wolde lyue but 
they that gone by flesshelynes wolde lyue for to ete & 
ontrary to nature. And wytte thou wel that too a 
[^f.B3r^] 
coleryk mannes stomacke whan the vertue is stronge 
and grete hete greate metes ben good. As be of porke 
grete venyson & grete bestly fysshes rough & grete brede 
salte mete flesshe halfe soden & grete myghty coloured 
wyne/ & yf y=e= hete of the stomacke be feble & yf he 
haue but lytell exercyse y=e= metes aforsayd wolde moch 
noye hym/ but to suche a stomacke gyue subtyll metes 
as chekens & small fysshes of stony renny~ge water. rere 
egges brede well baken & well soured small wyne & 
of clene & oryent colour not depe & suche other. But 
these metes sholde be corrupte of an hote stomacke/ & 
yf the vertu dygestyffe be in y=e= mene tyme of dyetyng 
as capons hennes partryches & suche other. Also and 
gouernau~ce of helth fle all cessyuous metes & namely 
these but yf it be for a medycyne/ fle also al frutes and 
all herbes y=t= ben not good as these namely/ cole wortes 
& letuse for they make maly~colyous blode Galye~ sayth 
y=t= my fader euer forbad me y=t= I sholde ete no newe frutes 
& grene yf I wolde be without sykenesse/ & whyle 
he lyued so dyd I & was also w=t=out sykenesse/ & whan 
he was deed I ete frutes & caught y=e= feuers/ & after y=t= 
I caught connynge to kepe myselfe I kepte me from 
frutes. And I had nomore y=e= feuers/ but yf it were a lytel 
sharp feuer called offymera & all my frendes y=t= kepte 
my doctryne/ kepte the~ fro~ frutes & had theyr helth/ 
Arnolde a grete clerke sayth thus. In lente lo~ge vsage 
of stoppy~ge metes/ as fysshe & pese potage therfor it is 
profytable fyrst to ete porrey of pesen/ for this is a wat~ 
that wyse men hath co~mended/ & thus it is made/ do 
pesen in fayre water all nyght & in the same water boyle 
them on the morowe a good whyle & then clense the~ 
and kepe the clensyng and whanne mete tyme cometh 
[^f.B3v^] 
do therto a lytell wyne pouder of spyknard a lytell saffron 
& clene small salte & then boyle it on a walme/ & 
so ete it for it openeth & clenseth well the capytall veynes 
of y=e= lyuer & y=e= wayes ofte of y=e= vryne/ & kepeth fro 
the stone & grauelles namely yf y=e= forsayd pesyn be soden 
in the forsayd water with persely. 
 
[}How a man sholde behaue hym in his drynke.}] 
 
THe lesse ye drynke at mete y=e= better it is euer so 
it be mesurably taken/ for a man sholde not at 
mete drynke moche lest it make mete to swy~me in his 
stomak/ wherfore me~ sholde dry~ke a lytell/ so y=t= the mete 
be well medled & te~pred togyder. And then lette it be 
a longe whyle or y=u= drynke ayen/ & tha~ drynke a grete 
draught at ones ne drynke not to moche after y=e= fyrste 
morcell in no maner of wyse/ but drynke ofte a lytell & 
a lytel of smal clene wyne best accordynge to helth & gouerny~ge 
of thy co~plexyon & nature/ & for helth of body 
is clene & small claret wyne not to newe ne to myghty 
so it be wel & proporsyonly tempered with y=e= quantyte 
of clene water. More ouer no man be so hardy to drynke 
fastynge colde water/ nor after y=t= he hath accompanyed 
with a woman nor after grete trauayle nor after 
exercyse tyll he haue fyrste rested hym/ nor by nyght namely 
yf he haue gloue tofore & for why longe slepe and 
fast slepynge is cure therto. 
 
[}What shall be done after mete.}] 
 
AFter whanne thou haste ete thou sholdest stonde 
or walke a lytell softely vp and downe tyll 
thy mete goo downe to the botom of the stomacke and 
thenne slepe a lytell yf that thou be vsed therto bothe y=e= 
day and the nyght namely slepe fyrst on thy ryght syde 
for that is kyndly for thy dygestyon shall be better for 
[^f.B4r^] 
the~n lyeth thy lyuer vnder thy stomack/ as fyre vnder 
a caudron. And after thy fyrste slepe torne on thy lefte 
syde y=t= thy ryght syde may be rested of thy longe lyeng 
theron. And whan thou hast layen theron a good whyle 
& slepte turne ayen on thy ryghte syde & there slepe 
all nyght forth/ & loke y=t= thou lye not to streyght ne to 
croked with thy legges but in a meane bytwene streyght 
& croked. And in no wyse lye not vpryght/ for the~ 
wyll the superfluytes abyde within the & turne to wycked 
& greuous euylles contrary to helth. Also to ly grouelynge 
on the wombe is good/ so y=t= thy brethe be not 
greuyd therw=t= & y=e= heuyer & the gretter thy mete be & 
the more thou haste taken therof/ euer the lenger thy 
nyght slepe be & euer the subtyler y=t= thy mete be and y=e= 
lesse thou haue euer the lesse sholde thy slepe be. For slepe 
is full helpy to olde men for it maketh them moyst 
and therfore sayth Galyen whan he was olde he ete 
letuses with spyces for he wolde slepe the better. More 
ouer slepe is full helpy to the dygestyon of thy metes 
but not anone after that thou hast eten for thou myghtest 
be strangled. Also wytte thou that yf a man byfore 
auauntyssyed of his body/ moche slepe then is not gode 
for hym for it wyll waste his moystenes/ and of one 
thynge beware that to longe slepe or to shorte febleth 
a mannes body and breketh it. And after thou hast ete~ 
take no latuaryes nor other hote thynges for they turne 
thy mete to corrupcyon nor anone after thou haste 
ete renne not nor ryde not to faste for then euery stre~ge 
meuynge thynge turneth thy mete to corrupcyon/ 
also y=e= vertu dygestyffe is nourysshed thrugh rest also 
after mete & tofore asmoch as y=u= mayst fle wrath sorow 
& pe~cyfulnesse & ryght as tofore me exercyses be~ good 
[^f.B4v^] 
so after mete they noye & rest is best. Moreouer Aueroys 
sayth ryght as colde water caste in a potte boylynge 
letteth y=e= boylynge for a tyme/ so to drynke after mete 
namely sone letteth y=e= dygestyon & maketh it to cease 
for a tyme/ & therfore it is not good after mete to drynke 
moche tyll the mete be defyed/ but after mete to suffre 
thrust somwhat is good. And yf y=u= wylte easely voyde 
thy stomacke stande after thy souper tyll y=u= wery 
or walke a thousande paces & wytte thou y=t= glotery & 
whan thy mete defyeth not well what euer y=e= case be bathynge 
ne blode lettynge ne exercyse ben not good but 
rest slepe abstynence & dyatryon pypyon. Exercyse is 
not good for therby sholde thycke rawe humours be lose 
& then therof the lymmes sholde be nourysshed & y=t= 
were euyll/ for why in suche exercyse y=e= kyndly hete is 
not comforted but more febled & strau~glyd for y=e= rawe 
humours are dyssolued for ryght as water quencheth 
fyre so rawe humours quencheth kyndly helth. 
 
[}Of noyes of euyll gouernaunce.}] 
 
THere be~ many y=t= only not vse euyl gouernau~ce 
i~ metes & dry~kes but also may~tene it/ & as they 
seyen be~ well at ease & well defyen & they scorne leches 
& otherwyse men that vse good gouernaunce for they 
byleue y=t= they sholde be excused of theyr errour by ther 
lo~ge custome for why custome is a ful stre~gth in kepy~g 
of ma~nes body. And y=t= sayd Galye~ thus custome is better 
defyed/ wherfor thus sayth Auycee~ euyll mete vsed 
is better the~ good mete not vsed y=e= co~trary of all these 
sayth Co~stantyne as it semeth thus glad they not y=t= vse 
euyll mete though they be not now hurte aft they shall 
not so escape/ herte me~ may say y=t= custom accordeth w=t= 
ky~de or if it accorde it shal be holde~ & if it accorde not & 
[^f.B5r^] 
be not roted it shall be caste away but not sodenly but 
lytell & lytell. For thy though it seme the~ y=t= good gouernaylle

befe olde salted or bestly fysshes or rawe flesshe or they 
that slepe to lytell/ or exercyse to moche after mete or 
out of mesure cold or hote and so of many other truly 
of suche it may be sayd. But yf they leue of/ they shall
