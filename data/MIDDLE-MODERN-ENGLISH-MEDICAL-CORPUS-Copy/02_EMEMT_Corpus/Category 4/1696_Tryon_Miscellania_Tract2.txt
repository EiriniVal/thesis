[}Healths Grand Preservative,

[}CHAP. I. 
Of the Nature and Operation of Bandy, 
Rumm, and Rack, which of 
late years are become as common 
Drinks amongst many, as Beer and 
Ale, not only in England, but also 
in all the West-Indies where the 
English inhabit, and of the evil 
consequences that do attend the 
Drinkers thereof.}] 
 
BRandy, Rumm, Rack, and other 
distilled Spirits are all very 
pernicious and hurtful to the 
Health of the Body, if not sparingly 
taken on extraordinary occasions in a 
Physical way; for the Intention of all 
such Chymical Preparations, when first 
[^p.2^] 
Invented, was for Medicinal uses, and 
not be used as Common Drink, as of late 
years indiscreetly they are, to the Destruction 
of many thousands, the frequent 
use of them contracting such 
grievous and stubborn Diseases, as for 
the most part are incurable. 
 
1. All such Spirits as are drawn by 
common Distillation, though those cruel 
Sulphurous Fires, where the Air hath 
not its free egress and regress, atheir Volatile 
Spirit and Balsamick Body, is as it 
were totally destroy'd: As for Example, 
take the best Sack (which is the 
Richest and most Cordial of all Wines, 
and hath the greatest Body) put it into 
a Limbeck, or any other Furnace of the 
like nature, and draw it off, and you 
shall have nothing but a strong harsh 
fiery Spirit or Brandy. The same you 
shall have if you distill Sugar, only it 
yields a stronger Spirit, for the more 
Balsamick the Body of any thing is, the 
stronger and fiercer is its Spirit, when 
that Balsamick Body, and the pure Volatile 
Spirits are destroyed or separated 
from it. Now here you will see, that 
the Volatile Spirit and sweet Cordial 
Qualities or Body, both in the Sack and 
[^p.3^] 
also in the Sugar, are destroyed, and 
there doth remain, as is said before, only 
a fierce harsh Brimstony Spirit, void 
of all the wholsome Qualities Sack and 
Sugar did contain; for the Volatile Spirit 
or Tincture, is the Essential Life of 
every thing, and its the maintainer of 
its Colour, Smell and Taste. Now these 
pure Spirits will not endure any violent 
Heat or harsh Fire, but through the fiery 
heat, and want of the free Egress and 
Regress of the Air, they presently become 
Suffocated, and then the sweet 
Balsamick Body is turned sour; for this 
sweet Balsamick Body is the pleasant 
Habitation of the Volatile Spirit, and this 
pure Spirit is the true Life of that Balsamick 
Body; they are inseparable 
Companions, the one cannot subsist 
without the other; destroy either, and 
both die. 
 
Therefore all such Spirits so drawn, 
do lose their Balsamick Body with all 
their Cordial Virtues and Tinctures, put 
what Herbs or Liquors you will into 
such Furnaces, they are presently Plundered 
of their natural Colour, and run 
off white, whereby it appears, that 
this common way of Distillation destroys 
[^p.4^] 
the pure Natural Virtues and Tincture, 
for from the Tincture proceeds all the 
Variety of Colours, both in Vegetables, 
Minerals, and Animals, so that such 
Spirits do only contain a harsh fierce 
fiery Nature, and for that Reason, if 
they be frequently Drunk, do Prey upon 
the Natural Heat, and by degrees weaken 
it, destroying the very Life of Nature, 
by way of Simile: for every Like 
works upon its likeness, whence it comes 
to pass, that in those who addict themselves 
to the drinking of these high 
Fiery or Brimstony Spirit, their Natural 
Heat grows cold and feeble, and 
their Appetites are weakened, they destoying 
the Power of the Digestive Faculty 
of the Stomach, so that many 
such People after Eating, are forced to 
Drink a Dram to help Concoction; all 
other Drinks proving too cold for them, 
which constrains them to continue Sooping 
of such Liquor; a sad Remedy, when 
we go about to help a mischief by encreasing 
the application of the same ill 
means which first occasioned it; for 
these wrathful Spirit, have awakened 
the Central Heat, which is Root of 
Nature, that ought not to have been awakened 
[^p.5^] 
or kindled, for if the Central 
Heat be stirred up by any unnatural 
Meats or Drinks, or other violence 
done to Nature, then presently follows 
the Consumption of the Radical Moisture, 
and the pure Spirits and lively Tinctures 
become Suffocated, wherein consists the 
Essential Life of Nature. And as in the 
before-mentioned Example, the pure 
Spirit and Balsamick Body in Sack will 
not endure those cruel harsh Sulphurous 
Fires, where the Air hath not its free Influence, 
but presently becomes suffocated, 
or destroy'd, & the most pleasant sweetness 
thereof turned into a Stink, so neither 
will the Radical Spirits and pure Oyl in 
the Body, endure those Sulphurous 
Flames, and fierce Spirits, without sustaining 
the like prejudice; for that pure 
Vertue or Essential Principle, which the 
Lord in in the Creation endued every 
thing with (which is the true Life thereof,) 
will not endure any violent Motion 
or harsh Fire to touch them; especially 
if the circulation of the Air be 
wanting, as it is in all such Distillations, 
for these Spirits are are so pure and subtle, 
that when any Injury is offered to 
them, they either evaporate or become 
[^p.6^] 
suffocated; for this Essential Powder or 
pure Life, is the Moderator or Friendly 
Quality in all Minerals, Vegetables and 
Animals, which doth mix and qualifie 
the harsh Fiery dark Principal, and 
does allay and moderate the cruel harsh 
Nature of the dark Fire, as does plainly 
appear in all the fore-mentioned Liquors, 
and also in Charcoal, for before 
the Sack, or any Balsamick Liquor, was 
put in the Still and drawn off, those very 
same fiery harsh Sulphurous Spirits 
were essentially in the Wine, or whatever 
else it be, for it is the Root of Nature, 
and the Original to every Life, 
but being mixed or incorporated with 
the Balsamick Body and pure Spirit, the 
fiery fierce Sulphurous Spirit is thereby 
swallowed up, and as it were hid and 
moderated; for in what thing soever 
the pure Balsamick Body is predominant, 
there this dark furious Spirit is hid or 
captivated; an Example whereof we 
have in Sugar, where when the sweet 
Balsamick Body is potent, there also 
this fiery Sulphurus Spirit is strong, 
but not manifest; but as soon as this Essential 
Spirit and Balsamick Body are 
separated or destroyed, this dark fiery 
[^p.7^] 
Brimstony Spirit appears in its own form, 
and becomes like a mad furious Devil 
in Nature, its cloathing being the dark 
Fire; for this Spirit hath lost its Sweet 
Water or Friendly Life in its Separation, 
which before did qualifie its harsh 
fierce Fire, it also loseth its pure Colour, 
or bright native Shine, because the Essential 
Oyl is consumed, in that Separation, 
so that there doth remain no 
true Life nor Light in it, but being set 
on Fire, its Flame is of a dim Brimstony 
colour, which demonstrates that the 
dark wrathful Properties of Saturn and 
Mars, and their fierce Fires are predominate 
in all such Liquors or Spirits. 
 
This is further manifest in Charcoal 
(as war hinted before) which is made 
of Wood, but in the making thereof 
the pure Oyl or sweet Water, which 
is the Essential Life of the Wood, is 
suffocated or destroyed, for from 
that Friendly quality, the Wood 
had its bright Shine or Flamo, which is 
of a benevolent refreshing Operation: 
Now this pure Oyl or Balsamick Body, 
the Essential Life and Moderator of all 
harsh fiery dark Fumes or Qualities in 
the Wood, being suffocated or totally 
[^p.8^] 
destroyed in the making it, whereby 
the Original dark Sulphurous Fire becomes 
strong and raging, giving greater 
and stronger Heat than the Fire of 
Wood, but its Flame is not bright, clear, 
and refreshing as that of Wood, but 
it is of dim Brimstony colour, sending 
forth strong fulsome Fumes and Vapours 
very offensive to the pure Spirits 
and Health of those that are near it; 
for having lost its pure Spirits and Oyl 
of Life, in its making into Charcoal, 
there does only remain in it, the fierce 
dark Original Fire, an untamable devouring 
Spirit in Nature; for every 
Quality in Nature hath power only to 
kindle and awaken its likeness; therefore 
all such things as have lost their 
pure Spirits and Balsamick Body in the 
Separation or Preparation, must needs 
endanger the Health, because they do 
awaken by Simile their own, or like 
Poysonous Properties in the Body; 
and if it were not so, a little Poyson taken 
into the Body, would not destroy 
the Life; but Poysons taken in, do by 
Simile joyn or incorporate themselves 
with the Internal Poyson or Destructive 
Principle in the Body, which before laid 
[^p.9^] 
hid, or as a Man may say, was moderated 
or captivated by the sweet Body 
and pure Spirits, even as the fiery Spirits 
of Brandy are in Sack or Sugar; but 
so soon as the outward Poyson that is 
taken in, Incorporates it self with the 
inward Poyson in the Body, it does so 
powerfully strengthen and awaken it, 
that in a moment it overcomes the pure 
Oyl of Life, and the pure Spirits become 
suffocated, and then the Natural Life 
is at an end, for every Property in Nature 
(both in the evil and also in the 
good) does with highest diligence seek 
out its likeness, and wheresoever it findeth 
its Simile, there it joyns Forces, and 
mightily stirreth up its own Quality; 
which when it happens in the Evil Nature, 
as it does in Brandy, Rumm, Rack, 
and other Distilled Liquors, then it endangers 
the Health and Wellfare of the 
Body. 
 
Nor is it otherwise in all sorts of 
Food and other Drinks, if the pure 
Vertue thereof be separated or any way 
destroyed, for then forthwith the dark 
Brimstony Spirit is set at liberty, which 
before the Separation, the Balsamick 
Body and pure Spirits did qualifie and 
[^p.10^] 
hold Captive, that it could not manifest 
its self in its own Nature, but being 
separated from the good Properties 
and Friendly Principle, this dark fiery 
sulphurous Spirit, becomes of a furious 
Nature and Operation, endeavouring to 
bring all in Subjection to it self; therefore 
such Liquors or Spirits frequently 
taken, burn up the Radical Moisture 
and Natural Heat, and are grreedy devourers 
of the sweet Oyl in the Body, 
whence proceeds General Obstructions, 
Crude Windy Humours, Consumptions, unnatural 
Heats and Flushings, loss of Appetite, 
Reachings to Vomit, and many other 
Disorders; and if those of the Female 
Sex take to drink such Spirits, as of late 
years they do too frequently, the Evils 
are doubled unto them. 
 
2. In all the before-mentioned Spirits 
that have passed through those cruel 
harsh Fires where the Air hath not its 
free Egress and Regress, the pure Spirit 
and sweet Body is totally destroyed, 
which is the Root of Motion and Fermentation; 
therefore such Spirits will 
not Work or Ferment as all other 
Drinks and Liquors will, even water it 
self; but you may put what quantity of 
[^p.11^] 
Sugar you will to Brandy, Rumm, or any 
other Distilled Spirits, they will continue 
a strong Fire, void of Mo ion or 
Fermentation; this doth further declare 
that all the good Principles and 
Vertues are destroyed by the Preparation, 
and that there remains only a 
strong fixed Fire, which has its Uses in 
Physick, as is mentioned before, but not 
otherwise. 
 
3. Such Spirits being frequently 
drunk, do generate various Diseases, 
according to each Mans Nature and 
Constitution, and the Climate whether 
hot or cold, for they do powerfully 
Prey upon the Natural Heat, consuming 
the sweet Oyl and pure Spirits, for 
the Balsamick Body and pure Spirits of 
all such Liquors being destroyed, in the 
Preparation, they become an Extream, 
which Nature in her simplicity hates, 
and for this Cause such Liquors cannot 
Administer any Proper or Agreeable Nourishment 
to the Body, or to the pure 
Spirits; it cannot give what it hath not, 
it hath only Power to awaken the Central 
Heat or Fire, which ought not to 
have been kindled; and this it doth by 
a Sympathetical Operation, for all 
[^p.12^] 
Meats and Drinks have power in the 
Body to awaken and strengthen their 
likeness; for this reason all Wise Men 
Skilled in the Mysteries of Nature, have 
commended simple Meats and Drinks, 
because most such things are as it were 
equal in their Parts, having no manifest 
Quality that does predominate violently 
over the other, but yet contains a 
sufficient Nourishment for the Body, 
and also for the Spirit; for Meats and 
Drinks ought to be equal in their parts, 
the Spirit ought not to be separated 
from the Body, nor the Body from the 
Spirit, but both ought to be Administred 
together; for the Body without the 
Spirit is of a gross heavy dull or dead 
Nature, and the Spirit without the Body 
is too violent and fiery, but the 
Health of Mans Body and Mind, doth 
chiefly consist in the equality of both; 
do not all Meats and Drinks wherein any 
Quality or Property of Nature is 
extream (whether it be in Vertue, or 
Harmfulness) if not sparingly taken, 
certainly discompose the Harmony both 
of the Body and Mind? For every Quality 
begets its likeness, and so on the 
contrary; Concord and Harmony are 
[^p.13^] 
maintain'd by their likenesses; if there be not 
a Sympathetical agreement between the 
Stomach and the Meats and Drinks, 
both in Quality and Quantity, the Unity 
and Concord of the Properties of 
Nature are immediately broken, whence 
proceeds various Diseases according to 
the degrees of the Disorder. 
 
This every one ought to understand, 
or else they may unadvisedly lay heavier 
Burdens than Nature can bear; for 
most Diseases are generated through 
surplusage of Nourishment. For unto 
weak Heats there ought to be Administred 
a proportionable Food, but stronger 
Heats will admit of stronger Foods 
and greater quantity, which all Persons 
might know, if they would but observe 
the Operation of their own Natures; 
for no Health nor Harmony can be continued 
where the parts do disagree among 
themselves. What Harmony can 
the most skilful Master of Musick make, 
if the strings of his Instruments be some 
too sharp, and others too flat; even so 
it is in the Elements of the Body, and 
also in the Mind. 
 
4. For Man is the most Beautiful and 
Perfectest of all God's Creation, and His 
[^p.14^] 
Image, called by the Antients, the lesser 
World; for in him is contained the true 
Nature and Properties of all Elements; 
Numbers, Weights, and Measures, 
therefore Man is both capable of, and 
and liable to receive all all Impressions, 
and to be influenced by all things he 
communicates with, or joyns himself 
unto, as all sorts of Meats, Drinks, Imployments, 
Communications, and whatever 
else he suffers his Will or Desires to 
enter into, the same things have power 
respectively to awaken their Similes, 
therefore all extreams are perilous to 
the Health: If Men and Women were 
but sensible of the danger, and terrible 
Diseases that are contracted by the 
frequent eating and drinking of those 
things that are unequal in themselves, as 
Brandy, Rumm and other Spirituous 
Drinks and high prepared Foods, they 
would not so eagerly desire them. Do 
not all or most that do accustome themselves 
to such things, quickly spoil their 
their Healths? Nature is Simple and 
Innocent, and the Simplicity thereof 
cannot be continued, but by Sobriety 
and Temperance in Meats and Drinks 
that are simple and harmless, which will 
[^p.15^] 
not only gratifie Nature, but contribute 
both due and moist Nourishment, 
for beyond all lushious fat, compounded 
Dishes of the Richest Food, and Spirituous 
Drinks, as it appears by many 
hundreds of poor People, who are constrained 
by pure necessity, not by Wisdom, 
to live for the most part on simple 
Food and mean Drinks, their Labour 
hard, Cloathing thin, open Air, 
cold Houses, small Fires, hard Beds, 
standing on Earthen Floors; by all 
which means, they are not only preserv'd 
in better Health, but also enabled 
to endure Labour with more ease 
and pleasure, than the Intemperately 
Superfluous can lie a Bed, or sit by the 
Fire. O then how excellent are the 
ways of Temperance and Sobriety! 
They free the Body from pain, and 
the Mind from perturbations, sweetening 
all God's Blessings, and giving the 
opportunity of time, which being well 
employ'd, affords many benefits both 
to the Body and Mind; for what advantage 
is it if a Man possess the whole 
World, if his Body be full of pain 
through Intemperance, which for the 
most part, no less affecteth and indisposeth 
the Mind. 
 
[^p.16^] 
5. Brandy, Rumm, and all strong Spirituous 
Drinks are far more dangerous 
in hot Climates and Countries than they 
are in cold, and do sooner there destroy 
the Health, though they be bad 
in both, except taken in a Physical way; 
I know this is contrary to the Vulgar 
Notion, but it is agreeable to Truth, 
Experience and Reason; for in hot Climates 
the Natural Heat is not so strong 
by reason of the forcible Influences of 
the Sun, which do powerfully exhale 
the Radical Moisture, open the Pores, 
and too violently evaporate the Spirits 
by continual Sweatings, which dulls 
the edge of the Appetite, weakening 
the Digestive Faculty of the Stomach, 
whereby the inclination to drink is increased, 
for which reason many desire 
hot Spiritual Drinks, because they find 
a present Refreshment, for all such 
Drinks do powerfully awaken the Internal 
Spirit by simile, and make Men 
quick, lively and brisk, during the time 
of their Operation, which is but for a 
moment, but afterwards they find themselves 
heavy, dull, and indisposed, and 
their Stomach feeble, cold, and raw, 
which does intice all that do accustom 
[^p.17^] 
themselves to such Drinks, To take a 
Hare of the same Dog, (as their Phrase 
is) and so they drink more, and are continually 
the more weakened, for all 
such fiery strong Drinks do not only 
Prey on the Natural Spirits, but also 
too violently do evaporate them. The 
very same Operation have all strong 
Drinks, as Wine and the like, if Temperance 
be wanting, but not so violently 
as the former. Therefore in hot 
Climates there ought to be double the 
Care and Temperance in Meats, Drinks 
and Exercises, as in Cold, of which the 
Natives of most hot Countries might be 
our Examples; for they do for the most 
part live very temperately, their Drink 
being generally Water, or Wine allay'd 
with Water, their Food mean, or more 
simple than ours, whereby they are 
better preserv'd in Health; for the Constitutions 
of all People in hot Climates 
are weaker, or at leastwise not so able 
to endure great Meals of Food, and superfluous 
drinking of strong Drinks, 
as they are in cold. For cold Countries 
make Men hardy, strong, and able to 
endure Intemperance, for which cause 
it is observed that most of the Northern 
[^p.18^] 
Climates are very Intemperate in drinking 
and eating, and in hot they are the 
contrary. And therefore our English 
are much Distemper'd, and many die 
when they Travel into the West and 
East Indies, because they take wrong 
measures, continuing the same disorder 
and intemperance as they did in their 
own Country, or rather encreasing it, 
which Nature cannot bear without manifest 
prejudice. 
 
6. It is to be noted, that those that 
do accustom themselves to the frequent 
drinking of the forementioned 
fiery Spiritual Drinks in all the Plantations 
in the West Indies, and also the 
common-eating of Salt-Fish and Flesh, 
which are all great Extreams, do thereby 
become very obnoxious to the dry 
Belly-ach, or Griping of the Guts, Dropsies 
and the Gout, for all such Food and 
Drink does violently stir up and consume 
the Natural Heat and Moisture, where 
the digestive Faculty of the Stomach is 
rendered unable to Concoct or make any 
perfect Separation, either of the Food 
or Drink, which oppresses the whole 
Body, whence are generated Evil Juices 
that fall into the Joynts, infeebling and 
[^p.19^] 
torturing them, and this is the Original 
of the Gout in other Complexions, 
these Disorders consume the Airy Flesh 
of the Bones, taking away their Natural 
Strength and Vigour, so that they 
languish away by degrees, and these you 
call Consumptions, in others for want of 
Heat and Moisture, the Excrement in 
the Bowels is contracted into so hard a 
Substance, that it cannot pass, and there 
is hardly a Medicine found that will 
cure it, this is that which the Learned 
call the Illiacal Passion, and the Vulgar, 
The Plague in the Guts, being one of the 
most tormenting Diseases in the World. 
And in other Bodies the Central Heat 
being wasted by such unfit Meats and 
Drinks, so that great part of the Food 
turns into a Flux of Humours, both 
Windy and Watry, which swell the 
lower parts of the Body, and this is the 
Generation of your Dropsies; but as 
God is always good, and his Hand-Maid 
Nature, an indulgent Mother, so 
they have as it were, chalk'd out the 
Means, and prescribed a Diet whereby 
these Diseases may be prevented, would 
Men but be so wise as to observe and follow 
it; for all hot Climates do furnish 
[^p.20^] 
the Natives with wonderful Variety 
and Plenty of Herbs and Fruits, far exceeding 
cold Countries therein, both 
in quantity and quality; for in those 
hot Regions, the Sun hath greater power 
to prepare all such things: And if our 
English would but accustom themselves 
to such harmless natural simple Foods 
and moderate Drinks, the forementioned 
Distempers would hardly be 
known. 
 
7. It is also to be noted, and much to 
be pitied, that of late years many English 
Women have betaken themselves to 
the drinking of Brandy and other Spirits, 
and have invented the Black-Cherry-Brandy 
which is in great esteem, so that 
she is no body that hath not a Bottle of 
it stand at her Elbow, or if ever so 
little Qualm or Disorder be on the Stomach, 
or perhaps meerly fancied, then 
away to the Brandy-Bottle; so that 
when such People come to be sick, which 
most of them are very subject unto, the 
Physicians do not know what to Administer, 
they having in their Health used 
themselves such high fiery drinks, that 
their Cordials seem like Water to 
them: Besides, there are many fatal 
[^p.21^] 
inconveniences attend the Female Sex, 
more than than the Male, in drinking 
such Drinks; most of which are not so 
proper to be publickly mentioned in 
this place, and therefore I shall forbear, 
but some I cannot but instance in; and 
though perhaps some Women too much 
addicted to the Delights of the Bottle, 
may be offended with me for telling 
them the Truth, and endeavouring to 
wean them from the Beloved Dram, yet 
to do them good, I shall venter the 
Hail-shot of their Tongues, and hope 
they will in time grow so wise, as not 
to indulge a foolish sottish humour, 
when it tends apparently to destroy, 
not only their own Healths, and shortning 
of their Lives, but likewise entails 
Diseases and Destruction on their poor 
Innocent Children; for it is not only 
against the Feminine Nature to drink 
strong Drinks, but also Destructive to 
the Generation of Mankind; it makes 
them Masculine and Robustick, filling 
them with Fury and Madness, and many 
other Indecencies, which are no less 
pernicious than shameful in a Woman. 
It also Distempers them by causing Fumes 
and Vapours to fly into the Head, generating 
[^p.22^] 
Wind in abundance. Therefore 
the Wise Antients did account it a 
Crime for Women to drink strong 
Drink or Wine, tho' their Countries did 
afford Wine in abundance; and good 
reason they had, for the whole preservation 
of Mankind resides chiefly in the 
Temperance and Government of the 
Women; if they are Intemperate, the 
Radix of Men is corrupted; are we not 
like to have very Fine, Hopeful, Healthy 
Children, when the Mother by excessive 
Pampering her unweildy Carcass, 
has contracted more Diseases than an 
Hospital? Or when they are put out to 
some Drunken Nurse, that instead of 
affording them wholsome Natural Milk, 
Suckles them up with the unconcocted 
Dregs of that Brandy with which she 
daily overcharges her filthy Stomach? 
 
The Nature of Women will not bear 
Excess in Meats and Drinks, as Mens 
will, without manifest danger to their 
Healths, and also to the Health of their 
Children; most Windy Diseases both in 
Women and Children, being caused by 
their Intemperance both in quantity and 
quality. They overcharging their Nature 
with Food containing too much Nourishment, 
[^p.23^] 
and Drinks that are too strong. 
This is chiefly observable amongst Wanton 
Citizens and the Richer sort of People, 
who pay dearly for the Lickerishness 
of their Palats, by the Diseases that thence 
arise, they being much more Distempered 
than the Ordinary pains-taking 
People. I confess their are hardly any 
Women in the World so Intemperate 
and such great Lovers of there Bellies 
as the English, nor is there any Nation 
more subject to Variety of Diseases; 
and therefore they are afflicted with divers 
Distempers, which Women in other 
Countries know nothing of. And 
as our Children are generally weak, 
Peuling, Rickety, and Sickly, so the 
occasion thereof is too evident, since 
they are almost made Gluttons from the 
very Cradle, their Mothers gorging 
and feeding them till they loath their 
Victuals, and often cast it up again; 
and when they have been Cramming all 
day, the good Woman entertains her 
Gossips with Stories, what a little Stomach 
her Child has, and that she can get 
it to eat nothing, and She wonders how it 
lives, and indeed so she may, but for a 
quite contrary reason, for this oppressing 
[^p.24^] 
Nature with Excess in Youth, is not 
only the cause of the Death of many, 
but in others it sows such Seeds, and 
lays foundations for Distempers, that 
they can scarce out-grow them, also 
many Women out of the like foolish 
fondness, give their Children strong 
Drink, which is very destructive to their 
Health. 
 
Nor is it become unfrequent, for 
Women not only to drink Brandy, but 
also to smoak Tobacco; which two things 
have a great affinity, Tobacco being an 
Herb of Mars, and its Poysonous fulsome 
attractive Nature from Saturn; 
the common use of it in Pipes is very 
injurious to all sorts of People, but 
more especially to the Female Sex, except 
it be taken very sparingly in a Physical 
way, for some watery and windy 
Diseases, but the usual taking of it 
destroys the Physical Vertues and Operation 
thereof; only the daily Smoaking 
it may be profitable to Gluttons, 
and those that Eat and Drink to Superfluity 
of Rich Food and strong Drink, 
and live idle lives, for such want Evacuations, 
but Exercise and Temperance 
were much better for their 
Health. 
 
[^p.25^] 
Tobacco and Brandy are certainly utter 
Enemies to Women, and also to 
their Children, for their Spirits and 
Balsamick Body, whence their true Life 
shines, is more volatile and tender than 
Mens, and their Natural Heat is not so 
strong, for this cause Women cannot 
bear or endure any extreams, either in 
Meats, Drinks, or Exercises, without 
manifest danger to their Healths, they 
being generally more sanguine than Men, 
and their Central Heat weaker, therefare 
all kind of inequality makes deeper 
Impression on them, and they are sooner 
moved to all kinds of Passions: for 
Women in their Radix are compounded 
more of the sweet Friendly Sanguine 
Nature, their Dignification being chiefly 
from the Element of Water, but the 
Root of Mens Nature is from the strong 
might of the Fire. And for the same 
cause Women are more Chaste than 
Men, and of colder Natures, tho' many 
Men do believe the contrary, but 
they are greatly mistaken in this particular, 
having no true understanding of 
Nature; they have judged thus hardly 
of Women, because many of them are 
[^p.26^] 
so easily drawn into inconveniencies 
by the pretended Friendship of Men, 
but I do affirm, that their being so easily 
overcome, is not from their unchaste 
desires, but chiefly from their Friendly 
Courteous Effeminate Natures, being 
of a yielding Temper, which is essentially 
in the Root of their Lives, and 
when a Man has once awakened in 
them the Love-string, which is quickly 
done, he may command them as he 
pleases; now finding them comply, they 
imagine that of them which they find in 
themselves: Not but that some Women 
are as unchaste as Men; but then 
such, through the Power of their depraved 
Free-Wills and Wanton Imaginations, 
have forced Nature out of her 
simple Innocent ways, compelling her 
often to do that which she perfectly 
loaths. 
 
The wise Antients understanding this 
Nature and Constitution of Women, 
and considering that the whole welfare 
and health of Mankind depended chiefly 
on their Temperance and Discreet 
Conduct, did therefore direct them to 
an higher degree of Temperance, and 
[^p.27^] 
thought it requisite, and so absolutely 
necessary, that both the drink allotted 
for Women in most Countries, was, 
and is to this day pure Water, and their 
Food as Innocent and Natural; they 
eat Flesh sparingly, living much on 
raw and boiled Herbs, Fruits and 
Greens, which is a most sublime Diet. 
And by this means their Women and 
Children are afflicted with such a 
number of cruel Diseases. There is no 
Country in the World where their 
Children and young People are so generally 
subject to the Small Pox, Kings-Evil, 
Joynt-Aches, and many Leperous 
and languishing Diseases; how many 
of them yearly die with Convulsions 
and Windy Distempers, which generally 
they receive from their Mothers? 
How many Miseries and aking Hearts 
do Women endure with their sickly 
Children? And what Women are free 
from Vapors and Windy Diseases, Fainting 
Fits, weak Joynts and Backs, their 
Blood corrupted, breaking out in small 
spots in the Flesh of several colours, 
their Stomach cold, and their Natural 
heat not able to digest their Food without 
[^p.28^] 
a Dram, &c? For all which Evils, there 
is no Remedy so long as our Women do 
continue the frequent Eating of fat gross 
Flesh (without Herbs) and other sweet 
high prepared Food, and drinking strong 
Liquors, as Brandy, &c. and taking Tobacco; 
for these things do continually 
heat the whole Body, thereby awakening 
the Central heat, which is very injurious 
to Women, for it presently 
sends Fumes and Vapours into the Head, 
and the fierce Fires with venomous Particles 
do penetrate the whole Body, 
drying up, and consuming the pleasant, 
moist, cool, airy Vapours, suffocating 
the pure Spirits, which otherwise would 
replenish the whole Body and sharpen 
the Appetite; it also dulls the Senses, 
and possesses the Blood with a sharp fretting 
humour, and hinders its free Circulation, 
causing the pure natural Spirits, 
whose habitation is in the Blood, 
to become impure, whence arises a general 
indisposition over the whole Body. 
Therefore all that love their own 
Health, or the good of their Children, 
ought to refrain such hurtful Food, and 
learn to know; that Brandy, Tobacco, 
and all such things, are to be taken 
[^p.29^] 
sparingly, and no otherwise than as People 
take Physick. 
 
[}CAAP. II. 
 
Of Flesh, and its Operation in the 
Body, and also on the Senses. That 
the continual eating thereof, without 
the due distinction of proper 
Times and Seasons, does darken 
the Spirits, and distempers Nature. 
Likewise of the Excellency 
of Herbs, Fruits, and their inward 
Operation on the Body and Mind.}] 
 
THE eating of Flesh was not allowed 
or practised in the first and 
purer Ages, when Men gave themselves 
to the Study of Wisdom, viz. To the 
Knowledge of themselves, and were 
partakers of God's secrets in Divine 
and Humane things, and enjoy'd 
Health and long Life, drawn out to the 
Age of many hundred years. For thus 
[^p.30^] 
the Holy Scripiure tells us, Gen. 1. The 
Lord said, Behold! I have given to you every 
Herb bearing Seed, which is upon the Face of 
all the Earth, and every Tree in which is 
the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, to you 
it shall be for Meat. And in another 
place it is said, Flesh with the Blood thereof, 
you shall not eat. It is not said, That 
the Lord made all Creatures for Man to 
eat, as I have heard many affirm, but 
he made them for his own Glory and 
Eternal Honour, and for the manifestation 
of his Wonders, and that Men should 
have Dominion over all Creatures and 
Created things, which Man hath lost 
by suffering his desires and imaginations 
to enter into the Bestial Nature, which 
does by degrees captivate the Noble 
parts in Men. But the Wise Ancients for 
divers Ages of the World, did know 
but little of the variety of Flesh and 
strong Drinks, or of compounded 
Dishes of twenty sorts of things, most 
of them of disagreeing Natures: No, 
their Food was simple and natural, easie 
to be procured without oppression to 
themselves, or to any of God's Creatures, 
as Herbs, Fruits and Grains, and 
pure Water for drink, which things are 
[^p.31^] 
endued with a most simple Nature and 
Operation, which neither dulleth the 
Head by Fumes, nor stupifies the Senses 
by Surplusage of Nourishment, but being 
well prepared, and eaten moderately, 
do nourish by way of Simile its like 
qualities in the Body, being of lighter 
digestion, and of a more Airy Operation 
than Flesh, being also void of all 
Inclinations, Senses, or Passions of 
Love or Hate, whose Original is more 
clean an nearer the Unity in Nature; 
therefore the Philosophical Antients in 
Former Ages, incouraged the eating of 
Herbs, Fruits and Grains, but on the 
contrary, made Laws against the common 
eating of Flesh without distinction. 
The Great and most Illuminated Prophet 
Moses did not admit the Children of Israel 
to eat any Flesh during their forty years 
March through the Wilderness: 'Tis 
true, when the People did Murmur, 
the Lord being provoked, gave them 
Flesh is his Wrath, and afterwards 
when they were admitted to eat Flesh, 
it was with such distinctions, and with 
so many circumstances as could not be 
performed, but by abundance of labour 
and trouble, and other inconveniencies, 
[^p.32^] 
by which Laws and Observations 
many of God's Creatures became 
of little or no use in the Creation, as 
Swine and the like, if indeed they had 
only been made for Men to eat. But 
the Lord never commanded his People 
in any Age to abstain from any thing, 
but it was always for their preservation; 
for Abstinence, Cleanness, and Sobriety 
in Meats, Drinks, Exercises, and 
Communications, do work wonderful 
Effects, and have a Sympathetical Operation 
both in the Body and Senses, 
rendering the Observers thereof Healthful, 
with brisk powerful Spirits, watchful, 
prudent, of good forecast, able 
to give Council, and for matters of 
Learning, they do easily grow to an 
Excellency in the knowledge of themselves, 
and in all other things whereunto 
they do apply themselves. And as 
for Prayers, Meditations and Contemplations, 
they do perform them with 
great Facility, Pleasure and Spiritual 
delight, being always fresh in their 
Minds, and free from Diseases in their 
Bodies. 
 
By this way of Sobriety, Cleanness 
and Temeperance, many of the Antients 
[^p.33^] 
became admirable both in Divine 
and Humane Wisdom; 'tis well known 
how Scrupulously the Pythagoreans (one 
of the most Learned and Mysterious of 
all the Sects of Gentile Philosophers) 
abstained from Flesh. The Divine 
Writer and great Prophet Moses, testifies 
that God made Man in his own Image; 
and that he should have Dominion 
over all things or Creatures, not 
that he should eat all things, or hurt 
himself by devouring them, nor suffer 
his desires to enter into them, nor theirs 
into him, for Man is a Prince in this 
World, and in him is contained the 
true Nature of all the inferior Creatures; 
for if it were not so, he could 
not be their Prince, nor be sustained by 
them. And tho' Man was made greater 
than other Creature that is visible, 
and to be Lord over all, yet nevertheless 
he having a Simile with the Nature 
of all things, is thereby rendered capable 
to be wrought on by every inferior 
thing he shall suffer his desires to enter 
into, and by degrees he is liable to become 
captivated unto that thing, be it 
either good or or evil; for every like 
(as I told you before) works on and 
[^p.34^] 
awakens its likeness; This was the reason 
why Moses commanded that unclean 
Beasts should not be eaten, that the 
Humane Nature might not mix or incorporate 
in it self the Beastial qualities; 
for every individual Man has essentially 
in him the true Natures and Essences 
of all the Beasts of the 
Field, and Fishes of the Sea, as also 
of all Herbs and Fruits, Stones and Minerals, 
and whasoever else can be 
thought of; for if this were not so, 
then Man would not be subject to be 
wrought on by all, neitheir would the 
various sorts of Food agree with him or 
nourish him. 
 
The wise Antients understanding 
this, and that every thing had power 
to attract unto it self such matter out of 
all things, as is capable to nourish its 
own Body, therefore in those days the 
eating of Flesh was not in such Reputation 
as of late years it hath been; 
especially as it is in England, who do 
make it their chief Food; all Vegetables 
and Fruits being in themselves of 
a clean simple Nature and Operation, 
which being well prepared and temperately 
eaten, have only power to waken 
[^p.35^] 
their Similies in the Body and Senses 
as foresaid. But on the contrary, 
all Beasts, especially unclean Beasts, are 
endued with all kind of Beastial Passions, 
as Anger, Revenge, Covetousness, 
Love and Hate, which Dispositions 
and Passions of the Flesh, but especially 
the Blood, doth retain after such Animals 
are killed; and for that reason it 
was, that the Blood of all sorts of 
Beasts was so strictly forbidden, for the 
essential Spirits dwell in the Blood, and 
in the Blood and Spirits lie hid all the 
Dispositions and Inclinations the Creature 
was endued withal, and therefore 
all sorts of Flesh that were permitted to 
be eaten, were to be well purged from 
the Blood. And also this same Blood 
was either to be consumed by Fire, or 
an hole made in the Earth and the Blood 
cast into it and covered, that the wrathful 
Spirits and Vapours thereof might 
not defile the Air, which is continually 
breathed into our Bodies; for when any 
Creature is killed, the great pain and agony 
they endure, does so powerfully awaken 
the Center of the wrathful Fire, 
and also the internal Poysons which are 
the Root of every Life, that the said fierce 
[^p.36^] 
Poysonous Spirits seize the Blood on 
their right Fountain of Preservation, so 
that the Blood does not only contain 
all the Natural Dispositions, Passions 
and Inclinations, but also the awakened 
Poysons and irritated Spirits which 
were violently stirred up by Death's 
stroke. For when the Natural Life is 
in danger (the continuation of which 
is so sweet unto all Creatures, and they 
do so unwillingly part with it, especially 
when the Creature is in perfect health, 
and strength) what a strange fear and 
dread must needs attend the Creature 
in this condition? And how strongly 
and violently are all the Centers and 
Powers of Nature stirred up? And 
then are awakened the revengful Spirits, 
which do contain the Blood, for 
that is their Habitation, which in this 
Agonous condition does often spread it 
self through the whole Body, and makes 
the Flesh look red, but this is generally 
drawn back again by the drawing away 
of the Blood where the wound is made. 
Now if this Blood be exposed to the 
open Air, these fiery dark wrathful 
Spirits do by degrees evaporate and incorporate 
themselves with the Air, and 
so defiles it, and renders it pernicious. 
 
[^p.37^] 
The very same is to be understood 
in all other Uncleannesses; and these are 
the chief Reasons why the Prophet Moses 
commanded the Blood either to be 
burnt on the Altar, or buried in the Earth, 
tho' there doth remain somewhat more 
to be said, why he commanded the 
Blood to be consumed on the Altar by 
Fire, which I shall forbear, and speak 
of it in its proper place; for those fiery 
wrathful Spirits that do evaporate 
themselves into the Air, being continually 
breathed into the Body by such People 
as do communicate near such places, 
as Slaughter-Houses, and the like, and 
more especially those that are of killing 
Imployments, those awakened wrathful 
Spirits do enter them, and powerfully 
incorporate themselves with their 
Similies; for this cause all Butchers 
and others, that do use such Trades, 
are more fierce and cruel, sooner moved 
to Wrath than others; killing is 
as easie and familar to them as Plowing 
the Land is to the Husbandman; and in 
a word, they are far more inclined to 
violence than Men of other Imployments 
are. 
 
[^p.38^] 
The same is to be understood in all 
other Trades, and also in Communications, 
as those that are brought up and 
have their Conversasions amongst Horses, 
are not most of them Robustick, 
Proud, Bold and Surly, like the Creatures 
they Communicate with; the same 
is likewise to be understood in many 
other hard working rough Trades and 
Imployments; are not most of them 
rash, head-strong, scarce endued with 
common Humanity? There is nothing 
so good, or so bad, but Man is capable 
of being captivated to it; from this 
ground it is that weak Inclinations, that 
a Man in himlself is hardly sensible of, 
may either by Imployments or Communications 
be made strong, which is 
one Reason why Mens Inclinations and 
their Love and Hate alters and changes, 
according to time, place, business, 
and communication, as some Men have 
declared, that they did not fear being 
overcome with Drink, Women, or 
the like Evils, because at that time 
they found no Inclinations to such 
things, nevertheless, Time, Opportunity, 
Communications, and other Circumstances 
concurring, many of them 
[^p.39^] 
have been overcome by those Vices they 
so little stood in fear of, though also 
Astrologick Configurations, and Influences 
have a share in altering and changing 
Mens Inclinations, and more especially 
when other causes concur: For 
this cause the most prudent is all Ages 
have advised all Men to avoid evil occasions, 
and the Apostle Paul saith, 
That Evil Communication corrupts good 
Manners, the truth of which no Man 
will or can deny. Now if Imployments, 
Communications, Labours, 
Words, and all kind of outward business, 
have so great power of changing 
and altering Dispositions and Inclinations, 
increasing them, and the contrary, 
how can we imagine but Meats 
and Drinks received into the Body, will 
have the same or greater Power and 
Operation, as those that feed much on 
unclean Flesh, as on Swine, and - that 
have their Conversation amongst Animals, 
are not many of them much like 
those Creatures, of sottish, dull, heavy, 
sordid Dispositions, yet subtle and 
cunning in a Beastial way? And on the 
contrary, those that drink Wine, and 
feed on the highest Food, have not they 
[^p.40^] 
Spirits accordingly? Also those whose 
Conversation is amongst Men, as Citizens 
and Merchants; have they not 
higher and greater Spirits, being more 
tractable and humane, fair and ingenious 
in all their Dealings, and Conversations? 
For all things have symphateticil 
Operation, whether it be Imployments, 
Meats, Drinks or Communications, 
every thing does secretly awaken 
its like property, which do often 
captivate the Spirit of a Man before he 
is sensible of it, being ignorant of the 
Nature and symphatetical Operation 
all things have with his own Nature. 
'Tis true, most Men believe that evil 
Company corrupts Manner, and will 
acknowledge that some sorts of Imployments 
do by degrees dispose People 
to Inhumanity, Violence and Cruelty; 
but if you tell them there is the same 
possibility and greater in Meats, to 
vary not only Mens Bodies, but also 
their Inclinations and Minds, they shall 
laugh at it as a ridiculous Dream, though 
in Truth it is a most certain Truth, and 
daily Experience (if we would but 
hear her Voice) bears Witness unto it. 
Why did Moses prohibit his People the 
[^p.41^] 
eating of Swines Flesh, seeing Swine are 
not serviceable unto Mankind any other 
way, but by being killed and eaten; 
and besides, a Swine is a Creature, that 
being well ordered, becomes as wholesome 
Nourishment, as some other Animals 
that are counted clean, though 
there is somewhat to be said against the 
grossness of that sort of Flesh; but the 
chief thing the Spirit of God in that 
great Prophet regarded, was, no doubt, 
the Spirit of that Creature whose original 
and predominant quality stands in 
the dark wrath of Nature, which is 
manifested by their shapes, cries, and 
tones, which Spirit the humane Nature 
ought not to joyn it self unto, lest it 
partakes of its Nature. Every thing 
having power to joyn its self with its 
likeness, and to strengthen its own property, 
Doth not Wine and strong Drink 
precipitate Men into Fury and Madness 
by Simile? That is, the Spirits in Wine 
do incorporate themselves with the 
natural Spirits, and violently awaken 
them, making them burn too fierce, 
which sets Nature into a Rage, awakening 
the Central Spirits till all parts of 
the Boy burn like Fire, till the Oyl be 
[^p.42^] 
consumed, and Nature begins to languish, 
becoming dull, heavy, and stupid. 
The very same Operation have 
all Food in the Body, and on the Spirits 
and Senses, but more slowly and 
hidden; for great meals of Food makes 
dull when first eaten, for all the time 
Nature is digesting, and making separation, 
(which is four, five, or six 
hours a doing) and then Nature begins 
to be brisk and lightsome; for what 
the Stomach and Natural Heat do perform, 
as to Fermentation and Separation 
with the Food, is done to Natures 
Hand by Art in all sorts of strong 
Drinks; therefore all such fermented 
strong Drinks have a present Operation, 
but let Drink be ever so strong, 
if it have not passed through Fermentation 
and Separation, it will lie heavy 
on the Stomach, and send dark and dulling 
fumes into the Head, if a quantity 
be drunk: Therefore great Meals of 
strong rich Food, do endanger the 
Health more than proportionable drinking 
of strong Drinks, especially in hot 
Countries, and in Summer time in colder 
Climates. That Dispositions and Inclinations 
are chang'd and alter'd by 
[^p.43^] 
Food, may further appear in all or 
most unclean Creatures, are they not 
made much fiercer, if raw flesh and 
blood be given them, their wrathful 
unclean Nature being thereby enraged 
and made stronger? And is not the very 
flesh of those Creatures Men feed on, 
altered either for the better or worse, 
according to the nature of their Food; 
what a vast difference shall there be as 
to the goodness or badness, wholesomness, 
or unwholesomeness of the Milk 
of the very same Cow, when she feeds 
upon fresh delicate Grass, Herbs, and 
Flowers, and when she is kept on course 
Brewers Grains, or the like? The Elements 
of Man's Body and natural Spirits 
are compounded of the same matter 
as other Creatures are, and in respects, 
subject to the same or like alterations; 
only the Holy Light and Grace of God, 
which enlighteneth every Man that 
cometh into the World, if obeyed, 
is sufficient to subdue most natural Inclinations, 
and to keep them within 
the bounds of Temperance; indeed 
this Gift is the only power by which a 
Man may overcome the Evil and deny 
himself. 
 
[^p.44^] 
2. Flesh is not so clean a Food as 
Herbs, Seeds and Fruits, for all sorts 
of Animals are subject to various Passions, 
but on the contrary, all or most 
Vegetables have a more simple and innocent 
Original, therefore their Operation 
on the body and Senses is as simple, 
having no power to awaken any 
property in the Body, but what is like 
themselves. Furthermore we see that 
no Creatures that are clean will eat 
Flesh, except they be taught it, and 
brought to it by degrees; on the other 
side, all such Animals as naturally will 
eat Flesh, are by all means counted unclean, 
as Dogs, Cats, Bears, Wolves, 
Foxes, and many others, both in the Sea 
and Land, and most Men will avoid the 
eating of such Creatures, as being unclean 
in the Root of their Natures. 
Therefore they desire such Food as hath 
affinity with them, for every Creature 
rejoyceth in its likeness. The Prophet 
Moses well understood this, when he 
commanded that unclean Creatures and 
Blood should not be eaten, because the 
Blood (as is mentioned before) doth not 
only contain the Spirits, but the very 
Humour, Dispositions and Inclinations 
[^p.45^] 
of the Creature, therefore it was to be 
killed and dressed in such a manner, 
by which the Blood and superluous matter 
was extinguished, and if Flesh should 
now be prepared after their way, we 
should not account it to have half the 
Vertue as it hath in our way of preparation. 
Indeed the way of killing and preparing 
of Flesh and Fish, that the Law-giver 
prescribed to his People, was to 
cleanse the Flesh from all Blood in which 
stand the Spirits, and all the Dispositions 
and Inclinations of the Creature 
lie hid. By this means the Uniting of 
the Bestial Nature with the Human, was 
in a great measure prevented; and for 
no other reason all unclean Beasts, 
Fowls and Fishes were so severely forbidden. 
All Created things have but 
one only Ground and Original. Every 
particular Creature contains the true 
Nature and Properties of the whole, 
only the qualities are in several degrees, 
one having one quality strong, and another 
the Center. For in every Creature 
one of the forms or properties do 
carry the upward Dominion, and other 
qualities lye as it were hid, but some 
times do manifest themselves, but that 
[^p.46^] 
property which is weakest may be awakened 
and made strong by its Simile, as 
often comes to pass. 
 
From this very ground proceeds all 
Sympathy and Antipathy, Concord and 
Discord in this World. For all those 
whose predominate qualities stand nearest, 
and have affinity to each other, such 
are friendly one to another, - but those 
whose predominate Propertise have 
Antipathy each to other, such slight one 
another, and if the Grace and Holy 
Light of God do not restrain them, they 
are very apt to speak Evil and Backbite 
one another. The same is to be understood 
in the Divine Principle of God's 
Love, those that through the Blessing 
and Favour of the Lord have, have obtained 
the Holy Gifts of the Spirit, 
be it more or less, all such People have affinity 
and bear good will each to other; 
except the false Prophet's Opinion get 
in amongst them, which is a Ravening 
Wolf. Every thing rejoyceth in its 
likeness, and the contrary in its death, 
therefore it is highly convenient, for 
every man to consider the Variety and 
the Possibility of ist own Nature, and 
that in himself is contained the true 
[^p.47^] 
Nature of every thing in the visible and 
invisible World, and that he bears a 
Simile with all things, and is both capable 
and liable to be drawn either to 
Vice or Vertue, by every thing he joyns 
himself to, whether Meats, Drinks, 
Communications, or whatever else a 
Man suffers his Will or Desires to run 
out after, or enter into, the same 
thing hath power to awaken its likeness, 
and for this cause all the Wise 
Men and Prophets have advised to 
Cleanness and Sobriety, and to the reading 
of Good Mens Books, which do 
stir up the good Faculties in the Soul, 
for all Books do bear the Image and Spirits 
of him that wrote them, and so 
by Simile do awaken the like Spirit 
and Desire; and so on the contrary, if 
young or old give themselves to the 
reading of Plays or Books of Romances, 
they will powerfully awaken by Simile 
the vain wanton Nature, which before 
lay as it were hid: Therefore it was 
said in the Revelations, Come out from 
amongst them, and be ye separated, lest 
you partake of their Evils. 
 
3. The Reason why most People love 
and so much desire Flesh more than either 
[^p.48^] 
Herbs, Fruits or Grains, is not because 
it doth afford either better Nourishment, 
or is pleasanter to the Pallate 
or Stomach, but it chiefly is because 
Man is departed in his Mind and desires 
from the innocent ways of God and 
Nature, and through his Free-will 
hath awakened the dark wrathful 
powers in himself, which have more 
Affinity with the Beastial Nature, than 
with Herbs or Fruits: For the Beasts are 
endues with the very same Passions in all 
respects as Men; if it had not been so, 
the Commandment hand not been so 
strict against eating of Flesh; for the 
Radix of Beasts and Men have a greater 
Affinity: And the more ignorant and 
sottish People are, the more they desire 
to eat Flesh, and the more Flesh they eat, 
the more Sottish, Ignorant, and Brutish 
they become. Also, the more the dark 
poysonous Wrath of God and Nature 
is stirred up, and the more it does predominate 
in Man, the more doth Man 
desire Food that hath a proportionable 
Nature. From this very ground it is 
that some sorts of Creatures esteem'd 
Unclean (whose predominant quality 
stands in the Wrath of Nature) do so 
[^p.49^] 
much desire unclean Food, because it 
hath unity with their Natures; the very 
same is to be understood of those 
Creatures which we call clean, they do 
as much on the contrary desire clean 
Food, viz. Fruits and Herb, because 
such things have the nearest Affinity 
with their Natures; and if Men had 
not departed from the Innocent ways 
of God and Nature, and suffer their 
Wills to enter into the Wrath and 
Beastial Nature, they would not so 
much desire Flesh; for Flesh cannot be 
eaten without violence done to Nature, 
for the Lives of all Beasts are as sweet 
to them, and they as much desire to 
continue them, as Men do, and as unwillingly 
part with them. And the 
Groanings of these Creatures that suffer 
Oppression and Pain, do awaken the 
Wrath in them that do it, which is a 
certain Retaliation or Reward; for all 
kind of Cruelty does stir up and awaken 
the Wrath of God in Nature, and so 
on the contrary, all Love and Concord 
does powerfully beget its likeness. 
 
Doth not every evil word, which does 
proceed and is formed from the Principle 
of Wrath and Passion, carry the power 
[^p.50^] 
of its Principle with it, and awaken 
its Simile in those to whom such words 
are directed? On the contrary, do not 
soft and pleasant words pacifie Wrath 
by awakening their Simile? Every Principle 
and Property in Nature must have 
its own Food, or else it loseth its 
Power and Strength. Mens coveting 
to eat so much Flesh, is too plain a sign, 
that they are departed from that Innocent 
and Simple Life for which they 
were made, and entered into the contrary; 
for if the Wrath of God in 
Nature were not awakened beyond its 
proper degree, and did not predominate 
over the Simple Innocent Life, 
then People would no more desire Flesh 
than out Holy Ancestors in the first 
Ages of the World. It is a token we 
are in gypt, when we hanker so much 
after the Flesh pots. As long as Men 
were partakers of, and followers of 
the true knowledge of God's Works, 
and lived in the simple path of Nature, 
which led to Health and long Life, 
Herbs and Fruits were in as great esteem 
as Flesh is now: It was a shame 
in former Ages, for a Man to be seen 
to buy Flesh, or to have carried it openly 
[^p.51^] 
in the Streets of Cities, but now the 
best Citizens count it the contrary, and 
make nothing to go openly to the Flesh-Markets 
in their Plush-Coats, and load 
a Porter two or three time a Week, 
with the Spoils of their Slaughtered 
Fellow-creatures; and if a Man comes 
to their Houses after Dinner, there he 
may behold a very unpleasant sight, viz. 
Greasy-Platters, Bloody-Bones, and 
pieces of fat flesh lie up and down the 
Kitchin, thereby rendered next door 
to a Slaughter-House. and this Trade 
is drove every day in the Week, but 
more especially in the day they call 
their Sabbath, tho' in truth they do not 
make it so, but rather a day of Feasting, a 
day wherein they bury the dead Bodies 
of Slaughtered Beasts, and a day on 
which our English Belly-Slaves and 
Gluttons, make their Servants do more 
work than any other day of the Week, 
as to dressing of Food. And day likewise 
whereon most People Cloath themselves 
in all their Bravery, and the 
Women go to Church to take notice 
who has the finest Cloathes and the 
newest fashions, &c. but why do I 
blame the Women, the Men have 
[^p.52^] 
been the occasion of all this and much 
more. 
 
If those of each Sex did hearken to 
the Voice of God and Nature, they 
would forsake such sinful Vanities, and 
not thus seek Death in the Error of their 
Lives; I have drawn the Curtain, and 
given them a brief view of Natures 
School, wherein the Sons of Wisdom 
learn to obey her Dictates, and by their 
prudent conduct and Temperance, avoid 
those many torturing Diseases of 
Body, and distracting perturbations of 
Mind, to which the rest of the World 
necessarily enslave themselves by their 
perverse folly. What I have delivered, 
is the very Doctrine of Nature, approved 
by Religion, justified by Reason, 
and confirmed by Experience: 
Those that wilfully slight so many Monitors, 
will scarce deserve Pity in their 
Misery.

[}CHAP. III. 
1. Of Cleanness in Food.}] 
 
WHat is more profitable for all Lovers 
of Health and Wisdom, 
than Food that is Radically Clean? And 
as Bread hath deservedly the first place, 
together with Herbs, and various sorts 
of excellent Fruits; so the next is Milk, 
which of it self is a brave, mild, and 
most friendly Food to Nature, very fit 
and profitable for all Ages and Complexions; 
and if it do not agree with 
some People, it is because their Stomachs 
are made sharp and sowred by superfluity 
of dainty Food, and the continual 
use of strong Drink. Also Milk 
being altered, it makes many sorts of 
wholesom healthy Food. Next to these, 
are various sorts of Flesh, which being 
killed in their proper Times and Seasons, 
and when they are free from their 
Uncleannesses, Surfeits, and other Inconveniences, 
which most Beasts are 
subject to; and if care be taken also 
[^p.54^] 
that they be well and moderately seasoned 
with Salt, and boyled in plenty 
of River or Spring-water (which is the 
best of all Waters, except Rain-water) 
they become wholesom Nourishment. 
For, River-water hath the advantage of 
running through various sorts of Earth, 
by which is sucks into it self a fat, oyly, 
and saline Quality, which the Surface 
of the Earth does plentifully afford; 
which also is the cause of all Vegitation, 
and the lovely Green Colour, which all 
Vegetables are cloth'd with, does arise 
from this Saline Quality. For these 
Reasons, River-water will Brew, Boil, 
and Wash, and it is more profitable in 
all Uses in Houswifery, than Spring or 
Pump-water, and far wholesomer for 
Men and Beasts to drink. Also your 
Vessel in which your Food is boiled, 
ought to be uncovered all the time it 
boils; for if the Air have not its free 
egress and regress, the pure Spirits in 
the Food become as it were suffocated, 
and then the food so prepared becomes 
dull and heavy; for the Air is the Essential 
Life of the Spirit; and all Food that 
hath not plenty of Water, and the free 
Influences of the Air, in its Preparation, 
[^p.55^] 
does certainly lose its natural Colour, 
with the pure Smell and Taste: 
For if those three Qualities be not preserved 
in all Preparations of Food, then 
the genuine Vertue and lively Tinctures 
are in part lost. The same is to be observed 
in all Physical Operations.
