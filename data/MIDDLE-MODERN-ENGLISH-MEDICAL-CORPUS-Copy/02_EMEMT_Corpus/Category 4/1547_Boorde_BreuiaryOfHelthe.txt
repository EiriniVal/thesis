in the fyrst boke named the Breuiary of health. 
 
[}The .11. Capitle doth shewe of a Demoniacke 
person the whiche is possessed of or with 
the deuil or deuils.}] 
 
DEmoniacus or Demoniaci be the latin wordes, 
In Greke it is named Demonici, in 
Englishe it is named he or they the whiche 
be madde and possessed of the deuil or 
deuils, and their propertie is to hurt and kyl them 
selfe, or els to hurt and kyll any other thyng, therfore 
let euery man betware of them, and kepe them 
in a sure custody. 
 
[}The cause of this matter.}] 
 
This matter doth passe al maner of sickenesses 
and diseases, and is a feareful and a terrible thyng 
to se a deuil or deuils should haue so muche and so 
great a power ouer a man as it is specified of suche 
persons diuerse tyme in the Gospel specially in the 
ix. Chapiter of Marke, Christ se~dyng his disciples 
to preache the worde of God, geuyng them power 
to make sicke men whole, lame men to go, blynd to 
see. &c. Some of the~ did go by a man that was possessed 
of deuils and thei could not make him whole 
Shortly to conclude, Christ did make him whole. 
The disciples of Christ asked of him why that thei 
could nat make y=e= possessed ma~ of the deuils whole 
And Iesus Christ sayd to them: this kind of deuils 
can nat be caste out without prayer and fastynge. 
[^f.5r^] 
Here it is to be noted that nowe a daies fewe or els 
none doth set by prayer or fastynge rega~rdyng nat 
gods wordes, in this matter I do feare that suche 
persons be possessed of the deuyl althoughe they be 
nat starke madde, and to shewe forther of demonyake 
persons the which be starke madde. The fyrste 
tyme that I dyd dwell in Rome there was a gentle 
woman of Germany, the whiche was possessed of 
deuyls and she was broughte to Rome to be made 
whole. For within y=e= precynct of S.Peters church 
without saint Peters chapell standeth a pyller of 
white marble grated rounde aboute with Yron, to 
the whiche our Lorde Iesus Chryst dyd lye in him 
selfe vnto in Pylates hall, as the Romayns dothe 
saye, to the which pyller all those that be possessed 
of the deuyll, out of diuers countries and nacions 
be brought thyther and as they say of Rome suche 
persons be made there whole. Amonge all other 
this woman of Germany which is .CCCC. myles 
and odde from Rome was broughte to that pyller 
I than there beynge present with greate strengthe 
and vyolently with a .xx. or mo men this woman 
was put into that piller within the yron grate, and 
after her dyd go in a preest, and dyd examyn y=e= woman 
vnder this maner in the Italyen tong. Thou 
deuyl or deuyls I do adiure the by the potenciall 
power of the father and of the sonne our Lorde Iesus 
Chryste and by the vertue of the holy Ghoste 
that thou do shewe to me, for what cause that thou 
doeste possesse this woman, what wordes was answered 
I wyl nat wryte, for men wyll nat beleue it 
but wolde saye it were a foule and great lye, But I 
[^f.5v^] 
dyd here that I was afrayd to tary any longer lest 
that the deuyls shulde haue come out of her and to 
haue entred into me remembring what is specified 
in the .viii. Chapiter of Mathew whan that Iesus 
Chryst had made .ii. men whole the which was possessed 
of a legion of deuyls. A legyon is .ix. M ix. 
C. nynety and nyne, the sayd deuyls dyd desyre Iesus 
Chryst that whan they were expelled out of the 
aforesayd two men y=e= they myght enter into a herde 
of hogges & so they dyd, and the hogges dyd ronne 
into the see & were drowned. I considerynge this, 
and weke of fayth & aferde crossed my selfe & durste 
nat to here & se no more suche matters for it was to 
stupendiouse & aboue all reason, yf I shulde wryte 
it, & in this matter I dyd meruell of an other thing 
yf the efficacite of such makinge one whole did rest 
in the vertue y=e= was in the pyller or els in y=e= wordes 
that the preest dyd speake. I do iudge it shulde be 
in the holy wordes that the preeste dyd speake, and 
nat in the pyller, for and if it were in the pyller the 
Bysshoppes & the Cardynalles y=e= hathe bene many 
yeres past & those y=e= were in my tyme, and they hath 
bene sence, wolde haue had it in more reuerence & 
nat to suffer rayne, hayle, snowe, & suche wether to 
fall on it, for it hath no couerynge, but at last wha~ 
that I dyd consyder y=e= the vernacle the fysnomy of 
Chryst & skarse y=e= sacrament of y=e= aulter was in maner 
vncouered. & all saynt _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]eters church downe in 
ruyne & vtterly decayed & nothynge set by, considerynge 
in olde chapelies, beggers, & baudes, hores 
and theues dyd lie w~n them, asses, and moyles did 
besyle within the precynct of the church, and byeng 
[^f.6r^] 
and sellynge there was vsed within the precyncte 
of the sayd churche y=e= it did pytie my herte & mynde 
to come and to se any tyme more y=e= sayde place and 
churche. Than did I go amonges y=e= friers mendica~tes, 
and diuers tymes I did se releuathes pro de 
functis hange vpon friers backes in walettes, tha~ 
I went to other religiouse houses, as to the Celestines 
& to the Charterhouse, & there I dyd se nullus 
ordo. And after that I did go amonges y=e= monkes 
and chanons & cardinalles, and there I did se horror 
inhabitans. Tha~ did I go round about Rome 
and in euery place I did se Lechery & boogery, deceyt 
and vsury in euery corner & place. And if saint 
Peter and Paule do lye in Rome, they do lye in a 
hole vnder an Aulter, hauynge as much Gold and 
Siluer, or any other Iewel as I haue about mine 
eye, and if it do rayne, hayle, or snowe, yf the wynde 
stande Estwarde, it shal blowe the rayne, hayle, or 
snow to saint Peters spelunke, werfore it makethe 
many men to thynke y=e= the two holy apostles shuld 
nat lye in Rome, specially in y=e= place as y=e= Romains 
say they do lye. I do merueyle greatly that such an 
holy place & so great a church as is in all y=e= worlde 
(except saint Sophis churche in Constantynople) 
shuld be in such a vile case as it is in. Consideryng 
that y=e= bysshoppes of Romes palyce, and his castel 
named castell angyl, standynge vpon the water or 
great riuer of Tiber w~in Rome, and other of their 
places, and al y=e= Cardinalles palyces be so sumptuously 
mainteyned, as well without as in maner w~in, 
and that they wyl se their Cathedrall churche to 
lye lyke a Swynes stie. Our Peter pence was wel 
[^f.6v^] 
bestowed to the reedifienge of saint Peters church 
the which did no good but to noryshe sin & to mainteine 
warre. And shortly to conclude I did neuer se 
no vertue nor goodnes in Rome but in bysshoppe 
Adrians dayes, which wold haue reformed diuers 
and many enormities, and for his good wyl & pretence 
he was poysoned within .iii. quarters of a 
yere after he did come to Rome as this matter w~ 
many other matters mo be expressed in a boke of 
my sermons, and now to co~clude who so euer hathe 
bene in Rome and haue sene their vsage there (except 
grace do worke aboue nature he shall neuer be 
good man after) be nat these creatures possessed of 
the deuyl. This matter I do remyt to y=e= iudgeme~te 
of the reders, for god knoweth that I do nat wryte 
halfe as it is or was, but that I do wryte is but to 
trewe, the more pitie, as god knoweth. Do nat you 
thinke that many in this cuntrie be possessed of the 
deuyl & be madde although they be nat starke mad 
who is blynder tha~ he y=e= wyl nat se, who is madder 
than he y=e= doth go about to kyll his owne soule, he 
that wyll nat labour to kepe the co~maundementes 
of god but dayly wyl breke the~ doth kyll his soule 
who is he that loueth god & his neighbour, as he 
ought to do, but who is he y=e= nowe a dayes do kepe 
their holy dayes, and where be they y=e= doth vse any 
wordes but swearynge, lyenge, or sclaunderynge, 
is the one ende of y=e= tale. In all the worlde there is 
no region nor cuntrie y=e= dothe vse more swearynge 
than is vsed in Englande, for a chylde y=e= skarse can 
speake, a boy, a gyrle, a wenche, nowe a dayes wyll 
swere as great othes as an olde knaue, and an 
[^f.7r^] 
olde drabbe, it was vsed that whan swearynge 
did come vp fyrst, that he that did swere shulde 
haue a philip_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] gene the knaue or drab a philip with 
a club that they do stagger at it, and than they and 
children would beware after that of sweryng whiche 
is a damnable synne, the vengeaunce of God 
doth oft hang ouer them, and if they do not amend 
and take repentaunce, they shalbe damned to hell 
wher they shalbe mad for euermore world without 
ende. Wherfore I do counsaile al suche euil disposed 
p~sons of what degre soeuer they be of, amend 
these faultes whiles they haue nowe leysure, tyme 
and space and do penaunce, for els ther is no remedy 
but eternal punishement. 
 
[}A remedy}] 
 
Wolde to god that the kinge our soueraigne Lorde with 
his most honorable counsell wolde se a reformacion for this 
swearyng and for heresies for the which sinnes we haue had 
great punyshment, as by dere price of corne and other vitaylis, 
for no man can remedy these sinnes but god & our kynge 
for there be a perilous nomber of them in Englande if they 
were diligently sought out, I do speke here of heretykes as 
for swearers, a man nede nat to seke for them, for in y=e= kinges 
court, and lordes courtes, in cities, borowes, and in townes 
and in euery house in maner there is abdominable swearyng 
and no man doth go about to redresse it, but doth take swearynge 
as for no synne, which is a damnable synne and they 
the whiche doth vse it be possessed of the deuil and no ma~ can 
helpe them but God and the kyng. For Demoniacus loke in 
the capitle named Mania.

passion in their slepe shall thinke and dreame that 
they do make water against a wal, a tree, or hedge 
or such lyke, and so dreaminge they do make water 
in their bedde. 
 
[}The cause of this impediment.}]
