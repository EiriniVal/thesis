MOses the moste faithefull seruaunt 
of the high God, beyng 
enspired by the holie ghost, and 
writing of the beginning of the 
worlde, dooeth euidentlie declare in the 
booke whiche is called Genesis. That almightie 
[/1./] 
God by his omnipotencie (after 
that he had made all other liuyng creatures 
in the world) he created Adam and 
Eue our firste parentes, blessyng theim 
and saiyng, encrease, and multiplie, and 
replenishe the yearth: whiche blessyng 
(although after it, through their transgression, 
thei were driuen out of the pleasaunt 
Paradise, and cast forthe into this 
vale of miserie, the yearth, them selues, 
[^f.1v^] 
and their posteritee, being cursed for their 
offence) yet it tooke soche effecte that all 
mankinde, whiche haue been since that 
tyme, vntill this daie, haue proceaded of 
theim and their posteritee, beyng ingendred 
by the coniunction of their pare~tes. 
[/2./] 
Soche was the wonderfull prouidence 
of God omnipotente, from the beginyng 
that all liuyng creatures, should contain 
in theim selues soche seede, as doeth sufffice 
to engender their like in their kinde, 
that thereby the frailtee and mortalitee 
of eche kinde of liuyng creatures, might 
by succession be preserued from vtter decaie, 
and remain from age to age: continually 
increasyng by many hundred yeres, 
to the settyng foorthe of Goddes glorie, 
which thyng as dooeth plainlie appere 
in euery kinde of creature: so it maie 
[/3./] 
sufficiently and moste manifestly be perceiued, 
by consideryng the state of mankind. 
Whose life, although for the moste 
part after Noes floode, it hath not exceaded 
an hundred yeares in one particular 
man, yet none can deny but at this daie, 
[^f.2r^] 
(beyng aboue fiue thousande yeres from 
[/4./] 
the beginnyng of the worlde) the nomber 
of men is so infinite proceaded of the 
two former persones our first parentes, 
that thei bee as the sande of the sea, or as 
the starres of the heauen, innumerable. 
The body therefore of eche mankynde, 
(the two former persones onely excepted) 
is ingendered of the seede of his parentes 
in his mothers wombe eche parte of the 
bodie, beyng their formed and fashioned 
by diuine nature, receiuyng no norishement 
of bloud vntill y=e= full time of birth. 
But after that the infante is borne into 
the worlde, as longe as it is tender and 
weake, it is fedde and nourished with 
milke, and when strenghthe is increased 
then meates are ministred to it of sondry 
[/5./] 
substaunce, & harder of digestion. Wherin 
if a due order and moderate measure 
be kept, and certain other necessarie circumstaunces 
obserued, whiche both reason 
and arte prescribeth as shalbee hereafter 
declared, then the bodie continueth 
alwaies vnto the laste age in safetie and 
[^f.2v^] 
healthe, moreouer eche member kepeth 
his naturall estate, and is both able and 
readie to doe soche functio~s and busines 
as nature hath ordained them to doe. As 
[/6./] 
the stomacke to haue a good appetite, and 
to digest and alter meates well, the liuer 
to engender good bloud, the raynes 
to seperate vrine from the bloud, & soche 
like, excepting alwayes some externall 
and violent outward cause, whiche maie 
hinder their operation, as a winde, a fall, 
or suche like, of whiche I entende not to 
speake further in this place. 
 
[}The seconde Chapiter. 
What thinges be requisite for hym 
to knowe whiche would kepe 
his bodie in health.}] 
 
THe preseruatio~ of health doth 
chiefly consiste in knowledge 
of the bodie, and in due & moderate 
vse of sustinaunce ministred 
to thesame. Of the firste parte I 
will chiefly intreate in this booke. 
 
[/7./] 
First it is requisite to come to y=e= knowledge 
of our bodies, by vnderstandyng 
[^f.3r^] 
whereof they are compacte and made. 
 
Secondarily, it is good and nedefull 
to knowe the differences of the partes of 
the bodie. 
 
Thirdly, their offices and powers, 
are to be considered. 
 
Fourtly, the diuersitie af humours. 
 
Last of all, the complexions of the bodies; 
are to be diligently marked: whiche 
thinges duely and exactely considered & 
noted. A meete diet may sone bee serched 
out, whiche if it bee obserued there is no 
doubte but health may be preserued and 
sicknes eschued so long as nature is able 
to sustaine the body, which thing Galen 
[/8./] 
the Prince of all Phisitions declared in 
him self, who although by nature he had 
a weake body which was subiect to many 
diseases in his youth; yet he confesseth 
hym self, that after eightene yeres of age 
beyng then somewhat skilfull in Phisicke, 
he so preserued his bodie, that from 
those yeares vntill the time of his death, 
which many reporte to be about the hu~dred 
yere of his age, he was neuer vexed 
[^f.3v^] 
with any sicknes, except it were with a 
[/9./] 
feuer called Ephemera, whiche lasteth 
but one daie, and that also he could easely 
haue auoyded, if he had not more regarded 
at sometyme to pleasure his friende 
with his arte, then to obserue in all pointes 
the exacte preseruation of his health. 
But peraduenture some will alledge for 
this one example, whiche is by hearesaie 
that they haue seen and dooe knowe diuerse 
Phisitions whiche be often subiect 
to sundrie diseases, as well as other sorts 
[/10./] 
of men. And therefore, this litle perswadeth 
them that any arte maye preserue 
a man lo~g in health: to whom I answere 
that there is greate difference betwene 
those that study Phisicke only to get a liuing 
thereby, and them that searche out 
the knowlege therof to guide their liues 
accordyng to the doctrine of it. Of this 
last sorte of Phisitions was Galen, who 
thought it agreate reproche bothe to the 
science and to himselfe, if this prouerbe 
might truly haue been verified of him. 
Aliorum est medicus ipse vlceribus non 
[^f.4r^] 
statens, that is to saye: he is Phisition to 
other, hymself beyng full of biles & sores. 
Of thesame sorte also, many other famous 
Phisitions haue been, and at this 
[/11./] 
present be, whiche men of indiffere~t and 
vpright iudgement doe and maye easely 
perceiue. But of the first sorte, if there 
haue been any, or by chaunce at this present 
bee, I thinke they are an example to 
discredite this noble scie~ce, onely to those 
that bee ignoraunt, rude and vnlearned, 
who for that cause are enemies of this 
arte. And therefore it is a true prouerbe, 
Scientia non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem, 
That is: none is enemie to any 
knowledge or science, but he that is ignoraunt 
in it: if any that bee vnlearned, 
[/12./] 
doe take occasion to despise Phisike as a 
vaine thyng, takyng example at the life 
of the first sort of Phisitio~s aforenamed, 
I thinke I may safely iudge that they do 
it of an obstinate stubburnes, or of a cancred 
hatred, or els of wilfull blindnesse, 
like as the vile Kenobites and Papistes 
at this prese~t daie, do seke meanes to discredite 
[^f.4v^] 
preachers as muche as they can, 
by scrupulous serchyng and examinyng 
of their liuing, which somtyme thei finde 
to disagree from their doctrine. God geue 
theim grace to repente in tyme, that thei 
laye no soche stumbling blockes in werkiynges 
waies. Now I will leaue them, 
and retourne againe to my purpose, declaring 
in order the thinges requisite to 
be vnderstanded, for the knowledge of 
our bodies, as is aforesaied. 
 
[}The .iii. Chapiter. 
Where of mannes body 
is compacte.}] 
 
[/13./] 
FIrst it is to be noted that ther 
are foure Elementes, that is: 
fyre, ayre, water, and yearth, 
whiche elementes haue in the~ 
contrarie qualities one to an other, that 
is, heate, colde, drienesse, and moisture. 
And the yearth is the loweste and heauiest 
element, and it is colde and drie by 
nature: Next the yearth is the water, beyng 
colde and moiste. The aire is aboue 
the water, and is hotte and moiste. Then 
[^f.5r^] 
cometh in the fire, which is the highest & 
the lightest element, being hote & drie. 
Of these foure elementes (according 
to the sentence of Hipocrates, & Galene, 
and all other Phisitions of that secte) nature 
hath framed and made eche mannes 
bodie. So that euery mans body is compact 
and doeth consiste of the fower Elementes 
[/14./] 
whiche are so mixed to gether by 
nature, that none of them doeth remaine 
simple and pure in mannes bodie. And 
therefore wee oughte not to thinke that 
pure fire or water, aire or earth, should be 
conteined in mannes bodie, if that he bee 
made thereof, because the elementes are 
not vnmixed in any liuyng creature, but 
like as in medicine made of waxe, pitche 
rosyn and tallowe, when the are melted 
together, there appeareth neither waxe, 
[/15./] 
nor pitche, nor rosin, nor yet tallowe, but 
a thyng compounded of their substaunce 
whiche retaineth their qualities, and yet 
is like none of them. Euen so in mannes 
body whiche consisteth of the fower Elementes 
being commixed by nature in his 
[^f.5v^] 
generation, none of the elementes is to 
be seen or perceiued simplie and seperatly, 
but there appeareth euedentlie a substaunce 
commixed and made of the elementes, 
whiche substaunce retayneth in 
it the qualities of theim, and yet is like 
none of the~. It shalbe sufficient therefore 
[/16./] 
(for hym that is not so muche addicte to 
his senses) that he will beleue nothyng 
but that whiche he maie see, feele or perceiue, 
with outwarde senses: When he 
seeth in the bodie any me~ber that is colde 
and drie, and harde as bones, gristles, or 
suche like, he maye consider that the substaunce 
of yearth is there, where he findeth 
his qualities, as like wise when he 
seeth bloud moist and liquide, he may perceiue 
that the element of water is there. 
[/17./] 
The great heate that is in a liuyng body 
may put hym in minde of the element of 
fyre: Like as also the breath of man maie 
sone perswade hym that the elemente of 
aire is in mannes body. This example I 
haue brought forth only to cause a deeper 
consideration of the coniuction of the .iiij. 
[^f.6r^] 
eleme~ts in mans body, whiche although 
it can not by iudged by outwarde senses, 
yet it is certainly to be credited that euery 
member in mans body be it neuer so 
smal, doeth consist of the foure eleme~tes. 
And therfore the auncie~t Phisitions desireth 
an element, saiyng it to be the lest 
and moste simple portion of that thing, 
whiche it doth constitute and make. The 
cause why the knowledge of the elme~tes 
is bothe mete and necessarie, as well for 
him that is studious to preserue helth, as 
[/18./] 
for the Phisition, is, that eche of them may 
vnderstande that health doeth consiste in 
a naturall temperature of heate, colde, 
drinesse, and moisture. And contrari wise 
that disease chaunce to the bodie by distempure 
of the saied foure qualities of the 
eleme~tes, for nature hath giuen to euery 
member of the body in the time of generation, 
a moste mete & apt temperature, 
from whiche if any member doe decline 
in heate, colde, drinesse or moisture, there 
followeth some desease in that member 
whiche is consequente to the qualitie aboundyng 
or wantyng. 
 
[^f.6v^] 
[}The .iiii. Chapiter. 
Of the difference of partes 
in mans bodie.}] 
 
THough the partes of ma~s body 
be many in nombre, yet thei are 
comprehended in a fewe diuisions. 
Note therefore that there 
be some partes of the body that bee called 
in Latine (Similares partes,) that is to 
saie, soche partes as beyng deuided, eche 
pece is like the whole parte, & maye well 
be called by thesame denomination and 
[/19./] 
name: As for example, the leaste peece of 
fleshe is to bee called fleshe, as the whole 
member from whiche it was separate. 
And these followyng bee commonlie called 
Simulares or like partes, that is, fleshe, 
bones, sinues, gristles, filmes, ligame~tes, 
Uaines, Arteries and suche like. Some 
other partes in the body: bee called in Latine 
Instrumentales or dissimilares partes, 
that is, instrumentalles and vnlyke 
partes, and soche members are compounded 
and doe consiste of the saied similarie 
[^f.7r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.6.^] 
and like partes: As the heade, the hande, 
the foote, and suche other members, that 
are compact of bones, sinues, fleshe, vaines, 
[/20./] 
& other afore named. Note also that 
of instrumentall members there bee two 
sortes: whereof they that bee of the firste 
sorte be called principall members. And 
thei are fower in nomber (that is to saie) 
the braine, the hart, the liuer, and the stones. 
And these are called principal members, 
because without the three firste, no 
man may liue. And without the last, the 
generation of mankinde should cease All 
other instrumentarie members besides 
these foure are lesse principall, and are 
to be coumpted of the seconde sorte. Note 
moreouer that to y=e= aforesaied foure principall 
members, there be foure ministers 
or handemaides, that is senues, arteries, 
vaines, and sparmatike vessels, whereof 
senues serueth for the brayne, Arteries 
[/21./] 
for the harte, vaynes serue for the liuer, 
and sparmatike vesselles for the stones. 
Thus muche haue I spoken for the generall 
difference of members in mans 
[^f.7v^] 
bodie: as for the knowledge of speciall, or 
particular dffrences of eche part of euery 
member, I referre the reader to bookes 
of Anatomies. 
 
[}The .v. Chapiter. 
Of the offices and powers of 
members in mannes body.}] 
 
[/22./] 
THe facultie vertue or power y=e= 
nature hath graffed in any me~ber, 
is the cause from whence 
the action, doyng, or workyng, 
of that member procedeth and springeth. 
It behoueth vs therefore first to searche 
out what faculties there bee in the bodie, 
that thereby the operations of members 
maie appeare. Note that there bee three 
diuerse faculties or powers whiche dooe 
gouerne the whole bodie of ma~. And thei 
be called in Latin Animalis facultatis, vitalis 
& naturalis that is the animall power, 
the vitall, and the naturall power. 
And these three faculties bee engraffed & 
doe procede from the three first principall 
members, that wee haue made mention 
[^f.8r^] 
of in the former Chapiter, (that is) from 
[/23./] 
the braine, the harte, and the liuer, from 
whiche members all other partes of the 
bodie receiue their force and vertue. For 
in the braine consisteth the facultie and 
power animall, whiche is deriued & sent 
from the~ce by sinewes that spryng there 
into all partes of the bodie, geuyng sense 
and mouyng throughout the bodie, and 
increasyng with. And therfore it is to be 
noted that there bee three sundrie actions 
or operations, that proceade from this 
facultie, into diuerse partes of the bodie. 
[/24./] 
The firste action whereof the power animall 
is cause, is outward sense, and that 
is doen fiue maner of wayes, that is, by 
seyng, hearyng smelling, tastyng and feling. 
The second action is volu~tarie mouyng 
of any member, wherby a man may 
moue any member of his bodie when he 
will, and staie it at his pleasure, as the 
mouyng of the legge, the arme, the head, 
the tounge, and suche like. The third action 
is inwarde sense, and wit, or vnderstanding, 
and it is called in Latine Princeps. 
[^f.8v^] 
[/25./] 
It may be called in Englishe principall 
or chief. And there be three kindes 
thereof, that is imaginacion or common 
sense, reason or phantasie: And memorie 
whereof (according to Philosophers opinions) 
the imaginacion consisteth in the 
formoste part of the braine ouer the forehead, 
and the phantasie remaineth in the 
middle of the braine. Laste of all, memorie 
is placed in the hindermoste parte of 
the braine aboue the noddle of the necke. 
[/26./] 
The seconde facultie or power, whiche 
is called the vitall facultie, doeth consist 
in the harte, whiche is the fountaine of 
life and naturall heate, and it spreadeth 
fro~ thence in arteries or pulses, that haue 
their first beginnyng there, into all partes 
of the bodie, giuyng life to the whole 
bodie, wherfore the chief accion and operacion 
of this facultie proceadyng, is the 
geuyng of vitall and liuely breath to all 
members, whiche thyng is performed 
by the pulses continually opening or risyng 
vp, and shuttyng or fallyng doune, 
whiche when thei open, thei drawe into 
[^f.9r^] 
themselues colde aier, whiche aire doeth 
recreate, stirre vp, and refreshe the power 
vitall, whereof also the power animall 
is engendred. But when the pulses or 
[/27./] 
Arteries shutte, thei expell and driue out 
soche fumous and smokye excrementes 
as are engendred through burnynge or 
boiling of humours in the whole bodie, 
for naturall heate is not vnlike to fire, 
whiche in boylyng of any liquour raiseth 
a great fume, euen so whe~ naturall heate 
will turne the substaunce of meates, receiued 
into the substaunce of the members 
of our body, first boileth them and 
trieth them, takyng so moche of them as 
is moste apte and mete. And the reste is 
expelled out of the bodie, and is called 
an excrement. 
 
The thirde and last facultie or power 
that gouernethe the bodie, is called the 
naturall facultie, whiche consisteth in the 
lyuer and it is sent from thence into all 
members of the bodie, in vaines whiche 
dooe there begynne and spryng, ministryng 
nourishement and foode to eche 
[^f.9v^] 
member. And note, that this facultie is 
the cause of fower sundrie operations, 
whiche it geueth to eche member, & that 
is attraction, retention, digestion and expulsion, 
whose vertues are as foloweth. 
Firste by the power attractiue euery me~ber 
doeth drawe vnto it soche Iuise and 
[/28./] 
foode as is metest to nourishe it. Secondarely, 
by the power retentiue, eche me~ber 
is able to keepe still and retaine the 
iuise that is drawen to it, vntill it bee altered 
and chaunged into the substaunce 
of the member that it should nourishe, & 
these two faculties are ministers, or ha~dmaides 
to the altring or disgesting facultie. 
Thirdly, by the digestiue or altering 
power, that iuyse whiche is drawen to 
any member and retained there, is digested, 
altered, and chaunged into an other 
substaunce, and by the same power also 
it is aglutinate and ioyned to the member 
whiche is to be nourished. And last 
of all, it is made like to y=e= member which 
it nourisheth. Fourthly, by the expulsiue 
power eche member is able to separate, 
[^f.10r^] 
expulse and driue from it al suche superfluitees 
as be vnprofitable, to nourishe 
that member and soche as nature is not 
able to alter and digeste, soche superfluities 
and excrementes, eche member hath 
power by the expulsiue facultiee to driue 
from it, lest if they should tarie long in 
any parte of the body, they would putrifie 
and rotte. These be the principall powers 
and operations, whiche I alreadie 
haue rehersed. But beside them other me~bers 
[/29./] 
that are lesse principall, haue their 
peculier operations: as the lunges draweth 
in, and sendeth fourth breath, the 
stomacke desireth meates and drinkes. 
The liuer draweth the iuyse of meates & 
drinkes out of the stomacke, & the guttes, 
and turneth it into bloude, the gall draweth 
colerique humours fro~ the bloude, 
the splene draweth melancholie humors 
[/30./] 
from the bloude. The raines drawe and 
separate vrine from the bloud, and sendeth 
it downe into the bladder. And diuerse 
other members haue peculier operations, 
whiche would be to long to reherse 
[^f.10v^] 
in this small treatise. 
 
[}The .vi. Chapiter. 
Of the diuersitee of humours 
in mannes bodie.}] 
 
[/31/] 
THere bee in the bodie of all mankinde, 
fower sondrie humours, 
that is, bloode, fleume, choler and 
melancholie: which humours are daielie 
nourished and engendred, of the iuise 
of meates and drinkes, receiued into the 
body, and there altered by naturall heat. 
[/32./] 
These humours, maie bee called the second 
elementes, or the elementes of ma~, 
for thei are equalle with the elementes, 
and thei haue also the qualities of Elementes. 
For blood is hote and moiste, 
like the aire, fleume is colde and moiste, 
like the water: Choler is hotte and drie, 
like the fire, and Melancholie is cold and 
drie like the yearth. These .4. humours, 
as long as the bodie is in health, doe remaine 
in soche porcion, as nature ordained 
theim in at the firste generacion of 
the bodie: and thei keepe their appoincted 
places, their colours, tastes, and operations, 
[^f.11r^] 
for whiche nature ordeined them, 
[/33./] 
Knowe therefore, that blood is engendred 
in the Liuer, of the iuise that is drawen 
out of the stomacke, and is more aboundaunte 
in a haile man, then any of 
the humours beside: it is spred from the 
Liuer by vaines; into al partes of the bodie, 
his vse and propertie is to nourishe 
eche member. And if the bloode be naturall, 
it is hote and moiste, or rather temperate: 
it is red in colour, and sweete in 
taste, whiche plainly appereth in healthfull 
folke. 
 
Fleume that is naturalle, is lesse in 
quantitie then blood, it is chiefly engendred 
in the stomacke, and it is as it were 
nourishemente halfe digested, or halfe 
tourned into bloode, whiche beyng drawen 
with the iuise of meates and drinkes 
to the Liuer, the greateste parte of it 
turneth into bloode. The vse and propertie 
of the rest of flegme, is to make the 
blood to flowe more quickelie in the vaines: 
and flegme also, because it is liquid 
and slipperie, it helpeth the mouyng of y=e= 
[^f.11v^] 
ioyntes. And note, that naturall flegme 
is cold and moiste in operacion, white in 
coloure, and without taste like water. 
Choler that is natural: is lesse in qualitie 
then Flegme. And note, that nature 
hath appoincted for it, a peculiar receptacle 
and seate, that is a bladder, hanging 
on the Liuer, commonlie called the 
Gall: lest if that Choler should bee mingled 
with the blood, all the bodie would 
be yelowe, as it is in the yelowe Iau~dise. 
And therefore nature hath ordained, that 
when Bloode is made in the Liuer, the 
[/34./] 
Gall draweth fro~ it Cholerike humours 
to make it the more pure. The vse and 
propertie of Cholere, is to flowe into the 
guttes, that it might scoure theim, and 
clense them from Flegmatike excreme~tes, 
and that it might helpe their excrecion 
(that is) that it might raise and stire 
vp the vertue expulsiue, to driue out the 
egestions in due tyme. The Choler that 
is naturall, is hote and drie in operacio~, 
yelowe in colour, and bitter in taste. 
 
[/35./] 
As for melancholie it is as it wer the 
[^f.12r^] 
dregges, and grounde soppes of Blood, 
which if it be naturall, it is leste in qua~titie 
of all humours. And it is to bee noted, 
that nature hath appoincted a member 
in mannes bodie, commonlie called 
[/36./] 
the Splene or Milt, which draweth from 
the blood, this blacke and yearthlie humoure: 
leste if it should flowe with the 
bloode in the vaines, it would make the 
colour of the whole bodie blacke, as it 
chaunceth in the blacke Iaundise, wherin 
Melancholie floweth all ouer the bodie, 
with bloud in the vaines. The splene 
therefore is ordained by nature, to drawe 
awaie the dregges, and thicke residence 
of the blood. The vse and propertie of the 
Melancholie in mannes body, is to nourishe 
the Splene, and to helpe the accio~s 
and operacions of the stomack: for it causeth 
the stomack to comprehende well in 
it selfe, meates that are receiued, and to 
retein and kepe them vntil thei be fully 
digested. The colour of naturall Melancholie 
is blacke like yearth: it is cold and 
drie in operacion, and sowre in taste. 
[^f.12v^] 
These are the qualities and quantities 
whiche are naturallie conteined in the 
humours of mannes bodie. But if it so 
chaunce, that any of these humours doe 
alter, by any meanes in qua~titie, colour, 
substaunce, taste, or place, then thei cause 
sickenesse little or moche, accordyng to 
the excesse or decreace, or malignaunte 
qualities of the humours, declinyng fro~ 
his naturall state, whiche for breuitie I 
let passe. 
 
[}The .viii. Chapiter. 
Of the complexions of

[/37./] 
THe aunciente Phisicions doe saie, 
that a co~plexion or temperamente 
is nothyng els, but a mixture of 
the fower elementes: that is Fire, Aire, 
Water, and Yearth, and the make .ix. 
sondrie kindes of complexions, one that 
is temperate, and eight that bee not temperate, 
whereof fower be simple, that is, 
hote or colde, or moiste, or drie. And iiij. 
bee compounde, that is, hote and moiste, 
or colde and moiste, hote and drie, or cold 
[^f.13r^] 
and drie But soche men as write, according 
to the capacitie, or vnderstandyng 
of the reader: thei doe saie, that a complexion 
is a mixture of the fower humours 
in ma~nes bodie, that is. Blood, Flegme 
Choler, and mela~cholie. And thei make 
but fower sondrie complexions, accordyng 
to the nomber of those humoures, 
whiche doctrine of theirs, although it be 
farre inferiour to the other, yet it is not 
vnprofitable, but worthie to bee marked 
of all memne: for, thereby thei maie haue 
cause to consider that somme humoure 
doeth abounde more in some one manne 
then in an other, whereby the qualities 
and disposicions of diuers men are altered. 
It is necessarie therefore, for him 
that would knowe, of what complexion 
hym selfe, or anye other persone is, to 
obserue and marke, as well the inward 
qualities and disposicions of the minde, 
as also the outwarde signes of the body, 
accordyng to the preceptes here next insuyng. 
 
[^Extract 2, ff. 44v-61r^] 
 
[^f.44v^] 
[}The .xi. Chapiter. 
A declaration of sickenes 
and health.}] 
 
I Thinke it were superfluous to 
declare that healthe is profitable 
and pleasaunt to all menne, 
since eche man daily doeth wish 
and praie, either for the restitucion, or for 
the co~tinuaunce of the same. But I suppose 
[^f.45r^] 
it be nedeful to declare; what health 
is, and wherein it consisteth, that thereby 
the ignoraunnt maie learne to know 
when thei are in perfecte health, & when 
thei be enclined to sicknesse. Note therefore, 
that healthe is a naturall affeccion 
and state of the bodie, wherein eche me~ber 
is able to doe that office and accion, 
that nature hath ordained it for, partly, 
as the stomacke to digeste perfectly, and 
to haue good appetite. &c. Note also, that 
[/38./] 
this naturall state doeth remain so long 
in eche member, as it kepeth the naturall 
temperature, that it should haue, in 
heate, cold, moistenes and drines: and also 
hath the same forme, quantitie, nomber, 
and place, that nature hath ordained 
it to haue. If these thinges bee present 
to eche member of the bodie, then is 
the hole bodie in perfect health. Excepte 
some externall cause dooeth hinder it, as 
a wounde, pricke, brouse, or some soche 
like outwarde euente, whiche doe deminishe 
healthe; and cause some sickenesse. 
Note therefore, that sickenes is contrary 
[^f.45v^] 
to health, and therefore it is not harde to 
knowe what sickenes is, and wherein it 
doeth consiste. Howbeeit, I will declare 
somwhat of it, that it maie bee the more 
plainlier vnderstanded of al menne. 
 
Sickenesse is an vnnaturall affection 
and state of the bodie, wherein some me~ber 
is hindred and letted, that it can not 
perfectly fulfil that office and action, that 
nature hath ordained it to doe: as when 
the stomacke dooeth lothe meate, or can 
not kepe it till it be digested. &c And note 
that this vnnaturall affecton of the bodie, 
[/39./] 
doeth consiste in the members of the 
bodie, three diuerse waies, for either it 
commeth by distempure of some member, 
so that it is hotter, colder, moister, or 
drier, then it should be of nature: Or els 
by vndecent fashion, quantitie, nomber, 
or place of some member, 
 
[/40./] 
Or last of all, by solucion and disheuering 
of some partes, by vlcers, impostumes, 
woundes, or soche like: whiche partes 
wer ordained by nature to be ioyned 
together and therefore the seperacion of 
[^f.46r^] 
them is a disease. These bee the diuersities 
of diseases, whiche when thei chau~ce 
in ma~nes bodie: there is a strief and battaill, 
betwene nature and them, whiche 
shall ouercome other. And if sickenes 
ouercome nature, then doeth death 
insue: but if nature dooe ouercome the 
sickenes, then the bodie by little and little, 
is restored to health again. And note 
that in this combate, betwen the disease 
and nature, the Phisicion is as it were a 
minister and aider to nature, to help her 
to ouercome the disease, by soche meanes 
as the arte of Phisicke doeth teache 
hym, maie beste be doen: For there are 
sondrie kindes of aides, whiche are to be 
sought out by this meanes. First, it is to 
bee noted, that this is a moste generalle 
[/41./] 
precepte in Phisicke: Contraria contrariis 
curantur, that is, diseases are cured 
by there contraries, and therefore, if the 
disease by a distempure of hotte, colde, 
moiste, or drie, whereby any parte of the 
bodie is altered from his naturall state, 
then to helpe nature against that distempure, 
[^f.46v^] 
you must applie or minister a medicine 
that is contrary to it, that is a cold 
medicine to a hotte disease, a hotte medicine 
to a cold disease, a drie medicine to a 
moiste disease. And this muste bee dooen 
with diligente obseruation, or els there 
is daunger in it, rather then profite. As 
for an example. If a little distempure of 
heate shoulde happen to a member of the 
bodie, there might bee applied so colde a 
medicine to it, that would alter the me~ber 
into a greater diste~pure of colde, then 
the heate was. Note therefore, that the 
temperature of eche member, muste bee 
learned & considered, whe~ it is in health, 
and then the distempure must diligently 
be noted, how muche it diffreth from the 
said temperature, for so moche must the 
medicine differ on the contrary parte. As 
for example. If a member were distempured, 
that it were twoo degrees hotter 
then it was beyng in healthe, then must 
the medicine bee twoo degrees colder, 
then the temperature of the me~ber was 
And so by the meanes, the twoo cold degrees 
[^f.47r^] 
of the medicine, will destroie and 
quenche the twoo hote degrees of distempure, 
and will bryng the member again 
into his naturall temperature. Thus is 
a due proportion diligently to be considered 
alwayes, betwene the disease and 
the medicine, or els ther will rather hurt 
then good insue. But if a disease be caused 
by aboundaunce of humours in the 
bodie, whiche striue to oppresse nature, 
then the phisicion helpeth nature by taking 
away some part of the aboundau~ce 
of those superfluous humours, whereby 
nature is the better able to ouercome y=e= 
remnaunt in shorte time. And note, that 
this taking awaie of humours is dooen 
diuersely, according as occasion best serueth. 
Sometyme by lettyng of bloode, 
sometyme by purgation or vomite: and 
sometyme by prouoking of sweate, or otherwise, 
these and soche like are sometime 
the doinges of the Phisicion, wherwith 
he helpeth nature; against the disease 
of repleacion, in whiche the former 
rule is obserued. That is, to heale by co~traries, 
[^f.47v^] 
for euacuation and pourgyng, 
bee contrarie to repleacion and fulnes of 
humours. But in dooyng of these thynges, 
there ought diligent heede to be taken, 
that thei bee attempted in a conuenient 
tyme: and that thei be dooen with 
good measure, that is, not to little, nor 
to moche. And further consider where, 
howe, and with what you were beste to 
worke, that nature maie therby receiue 
[/42./] 
more co~moditie then hinderaunce. Here 
therefore, the helpe of a skilfull and circumspecte 
Phisicion is moste requisite, 
for if euacuacion by pourging, bloodlettynge, 
sweatyng, or otherwise, be dooen 
out of tyme, out of measure, or contrarie 
to that whiche is requisite, as if you doe 
pourge, when bloodletting is onely necessarie, 
then is the disease aided against 
nature, wherby greater dau~ger of death 
dooeth ensue, then woulde haue dooen, if 
nature had been let a lone. But to conclude 
briefly, note that in all diseases the 
duetie of the Phisicion is, to vse the contrarie 
remedie to the disease, that healthe 
[^f.48r^] 
maie bee restored, as to take awaie that, 
whiche is superfluous, & to adde to that, 
whiche lacketh, to soften hardnesse, and 
to ratefie grossenes, and contrariwise, alwaies 
endeuouryng to recouer the naturall 
state of the member diseased. Likewise 
in hollowe vlcers and woundes, to 
cause fleshe to growe, and to set in again 
bones that are out of ioynt, and soche other 
like: alwaies addyng, subtractyng, 
or amendyng that whiche is wantyng, 
haboundyng, or out of his dewe forme 
and place. 
 
[}The xii. Chapiter. 
What thinges the Phisicion ought 
to knowe before he attempte the 
cure of any disease.}] 
 
I Haue declared sufficie~tly in the 
former Chapiter, how that it is 
the propertie of nature onely, to 
striue and fight againste diseases. 
[/43./] 
And how that the Phisicio~ is but the 
minister, and seruaunte of nature, either 
to adde soche thynges to her, as she maie 
vse to destroie the disease withall, or els 
[^f.48v^] 
by pluckyng cleane awaie, the greateste 
parte of that matter, whiche causeth and 
maintaineth the sickenes. And therefore 
it is mete and necessarie for the Phisicio~ 
before he minister any thyng, to learne 
and searche out perfectly, the cause of the 
disease, in whiche if he be ignoraunte, it 
is more by good fortune then by cunnyng, 
that he cureth any disease. For, 
how is it possible to help nature w~ that, 
that she hath nede of, except it bee firste 
knowen what she needeth, whiche none 
can knowe, excepte the cause of the disease 
be manifest to hym, so that he maie 
minister thinges directly, contrary to the 
cause of the disease. And therefore I can 
not but lamente the ignoraunce of the 
common people, that are perswaded, that 
one medicin is sufficient for one disease, 
not consideryng that one disease maie 
come of sondrie causes. And therefore it 
necessarilie requireth diuerse medicines. 
As for example, weakenesse of the stomake, 
that it cannot digeste well, or that 
it hath no good apetite, is one disease, 
[^f.49r^] 
whiche neuerthelesse may bee caused a 
dosen sundrie wayes, therefore the cure 
of it can not be alwaies with one medicine, 
but rather in eche cause with a sundry 
medicine. As if weakenes of the stomake 
come of a colde diste~pure of it selfe 
only, then it must be made hote be some 
meanes. If heate causeth the weakenes 
then it must be cooled. Likewyse you 
must moisten drines, and drie moisture. 
But if the weakenes be caused of some 
humour that doth abounde whiche hath 
flowed into the stomacke, or hath been 
there engendred, then muste that superfluous 
humour be pourged out, either 
by vomite or purgation, with a meeke 
medicine. As if it be fleme, with a medicine 
that expelleth fleme, if choler be abounding 
there, then muste it be soche a 
medicine as pourgeth choler. And likewyse 
for Melancholie, a mete purgation 
muste be vsed to drawe out the humour. 
But if the imbecillitie of the stomack be 
caused by a distillation and rewme that 
falleth out of the head into it, then is the 
[^f.49v^] 
cure to be wrought in the head, and not 
at all in the stomake. And likewyse if 
distempure of the liuer or splene, dooe 
weaken the stomake, the cure consisteth 
in heeling those members, and not in 
ministering any thyng for the stomake, 
for it willbe well as sone as they are cured. 
Thus it is declared at large in 
one example the diuersitie of causes in 
one disease, that thereby all men might 
likewyse consider that euery disease in 
eche member of the bodie may and doeth 
likewyse come of diuerse causes, against 
whiche cause [^ORIG. BLURRED^] the medicines bee not directly 
ministred, it auaileth nothyng, 
but rather hurteth, 
Therefore let no man thinke it sufficient 
for the Phisicion, if he knowe that 
a man hath soche a disease: as the ague, 
the Colicke, the Flixe, or soch other like, 
that then he may straight waye (if he be 
conning) minister a medicine mete for 
it. No, not so but he must first searche by 
[/44./] 
all meanes possible the verie cause of the 
disease, whiche the ignorau~t people haue 
[^f.50r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.46.^] 
long time been persuaded, that a cunning 
Phisition may doe in all diseases, 
by the onely sighte and inspection of the 
vrine. But alas, thei are craftely be witched 
or couetously blinded. For to come 
to the knowledge of the cause of some inwarde 
disease, the vrine profiteth nothing, 
And in moste inwarde diseases of 
the bodie, there ought as good regard to 
be had to the pulse, and to the disposicions 
and state of the brain of the sicke, as 
there shuld be of the vrine. Also the egestions, 
sweate, spettle, and other excreme~tes 
ar not to be neclected, in so moche 
as at some time, thei do declare the cause 
of the disease, and the state thereof, when 
the vrine sheweth nothyng at all. As for 
exa~ple. In a pleuresie, or in an inflamacion 
of the lunges, or in a squinancie, or 
soche like. There is more to be knowen 
by spittle, then by Urine, likewise in a 
laxe or in a bloodie flixe or in a Colike, 
or Iliacke, there is more certainetie of 
iudgemente to bee geuen by egestion or 
ordure, the~ is by vrine: whiche thinges 
[^f.50v^] 
those that bee not altogether addicte, to 
their own fantasie, maie quickly by good 
reason be perswaded to credite. For Urine 
is nothynge els but the watrie and 
waishe parte of the blood: for it is strained 
from blood in the Liuer, and sucked 
from thense into the raines, from whens 
it distilleth doune into the bladder, and 
so passeth forthe. Since therefore, vrine 
is the excremente that is separate from 
blood: there is good cause why it should 
shewe the estate of the liuer, and of blood 
in all partes of the bodie. And also it can 
well declare the estate of soche members 
as it passeth by, as of the raines, the blader, 
and soche like. But certainelie in other 
diseases that bee out of the vaines, 
and be distaunt fro~ the places, by which 
the vrine passeth, there is no certain iudgemente 
to bee geuen by the vrine, vnlesse 
the vehemencie of the disease, hath 
infected the blood or liuer, after some sort 
Neuerthelesse, soche is the ignoraunce 
of the common people, that they thinke 
him worthie of no estimatio~ in Phisick, 
[^f.51r^] 
whiche can not at the first sight of the vrine 
(although it hath been caried .xx. miles) 
tell whether it be a mannes water, 
or a woma~nes, and how the disease greueth 
the paciente, better then hymselfe, 
& also whether he shall liue or die, what 
disease so euer it be, whiche thinges vndoubtedly, 
in diuerse diseases are impossible, 
to be tolde by the onely sight of the 
vrine. And therefore it is thought meete 
for hym that will minister Phisick duely 
and rightfullie: First to se the pacient 
and to talke with hym or her, whether it 
be. Then to fele the pulse, & to obserue 
well the state thereof: next to viewe diligentlie 
the excrementes, not onely the 
vrine, but also the ordure, spitell and 
sweate. Laste of all to haue respect to the 
place where grief is, and to consider the 
accidentes that rise therof, not omitting 
to knowe the former diete, and trade of 
life of the sicke. These thynges then beyng 
diligentlie and seuerallie marked, 
the Phisicion maie more certainly learn 
the cause of the disease, the strength therof, 
[^f.51v^] 
and to what ende it will come, then 
be cou_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]de by seyng the vrine onelie. And 
by that meanes he maie minister a mete 
medcine for it, whereby the sicke shall 
sone finde ease, and hym self great good 
[/45./] 
same. Otherwise he might by his error 
and ignoraunce torme~t the sicke worse, 
and bring perill of death, to his vtter reproche. 
Thus haue I partelie declared, 
what thynges ought to bee knowen of 
the Phisicio~, that thereby he might withdrawe 
and take awaie, the fonde and folishe 
opinion, that a great nomber of the 
countrie dooe credite, to be true (that is) 
that the sight of the vrine is sufficiente 
inough for a cu~ning Phisicion, to know 
the disease of the sick, and the cause therof, 
and to minister apte medicine for it 
 
[}The .xiii. Chapiter. 
Of the vse and commodities of pourging 
and bloudletting.}] 
 
NOte that if the bodie of man 
doe abounde with humours, 
whiche are ready to oppresse 
nature, then whether ther be 
[^f.52r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.51.^] 
sickenes in the body presente by meanes 
af them, or if there be but dau~ger of sicknes, 
those humours muste bee euacuate 
out of the bodie, either by bloudletting 
or by pourging, or by vomite, swetting 
or bathes, or by some other kinde of euacuation. 
But I will speake here onely of 
euacuation by bloudlettinge and pourging. 
And firste of bloudletting. There 
be diuerse thinges to be co~sidered before 
bloudletting. The age of the patient, 
[/46./] 
the complextion, the time of the yeare, 
the region, the custome, the strengthe, & 
the vehemencie of the disease. The age 
must be considered, because children vnder 
14. yeares of age, and old folke may 
not be let bloud without great necessitie 
require it. The complexion is to bee noted, 
because a hote complexio~ hath large 
vaines and abou~deth with much bloud. 
And therefore thei may forbeare a good 
deale of bloud. But coole complexions 
haue narrowe vaines and little bloude, 
and therefore their euacuation must bee 
[/47./] 
small. The time of the yeare must bee 
[^f.52v^] 
marked that the weather bee not to hote 
nor to colde. And therfore the springtime 
is moste apte time for bloud letting, because 
it is temperate. 
 
The region and countree is rehersed, 
because it is to be noted that if the region 
be very hote or very colde, it is not good 
to let bloud: a temperate region is meatest 
for it. Custome is not to be neglected, 
for thereby we may know that they 
that haue bene acustomed to blede, may 
better suffer bloud.letting the~ those that 
neuer were letten bloud. The strengthe 
of the persone muste bee regarded, for if 
there be great weakenes, it is very dau~gerous 
to let bloud at all, except extreme 
necessitee compelleth. Also the veheme~cie 
of the disease is worthie to bee marked: 
for if it be a vehement disease, you 
must let bloud streight, if the former circumstaunces 
doe suffer it. 
 
These thinges considered, if thei will 
permitte bloud lettyng, and if it bee in a 
necessarie cause, it shalbe good and expedient 
to knowe in what signe the moone 
[^f.53r^] 
is, for you must take hede that she be not 
in the signe that gouerneth that member, 
wherein you entende to open the 
vaine, and also forsee that she be in soche 
a signe as is good to let blod in, whiche 
the table in the ende of this booke, wyll 
teache you. The vses and commodities 
of bloudletting, are as foloweth, First, 
this is a generall rule that bloudletting 
is a vere good and moste conuenient remedy 
for all diseases that bee engendred 
of aboundaunce, flowing or eruption of 
bloud, as be chiefly the feuers called Synochi. 
Also the phrenesie, squinancie, 
pleuresie, peripneumony, opthalmie, & against 
all inflammations, and impostumations, 
engendred of bloud in the lyuer, 
the splene, the raynes, the wombe, 
the share, the armeholes, the armes, the 
legges: to conclude in al inward or outwarde 
partes, wheresoeuer the inflamation 
bee, bloudlettyng is good for it, 
whether it be nowe present, or that there 
be daunger that it will shortely engender. 
Also bloudletting is good in ferues, 
[^f.53v^] 
whether they be continuall or intermittent, 
if so bee the obstructions and stoppinges 
of the vaines, be caused of immoderate 
repletion of humours. 
And note that bloudletting, dothe 
emptie and enuacuate from the bodieall 
humours alike, as well good as bad. 
[/48./] 
And therefore it is chiefly to bee vsed, 
when there is to great an aboundaunce 
in the bodie of bloud & other humours, 
whiche do straine and stuffe the vaines, 
that there is a great daunger and ioyperdie 
and breaking of some vaine, or 
bruysing out of some fluxe of bloud or of 
chokyng, and extinguish naturall heate. 
And therfore in soche cases you must let 
bloud with all spede, although sickenes 
be not already present. For by lettinge 
bloud in due season, the superfluous fulnes 
of y=e= vaines, is brought into a meane 
state againe the paines that came of fulnes 
and stretching of the vessels, bee eased: 
The heauines that was felt in the 
bodie is taken awaye, and the bodie is 
lightned, and made more quicke and 
[^f.54r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.53.^] 
nimble to doe all soche actions as nature 
hath ordained it to doe. Also it causeth 
naturall heat to haue a larger scope, 
and a free passage by opening and emptiyng 
the straightwayes and passages of 
the vaines and arteries. Last of all if it 
be done in time, it preuenteth diseases, 
into the whiche the bodie was ready to 
haue fallen. 
 
Many more commodities might here 
[/49./] 
bee rehersed of bloudletting, whiche is 
done when it ought, and as it ought to 
be done, but to conclude (omitting all other) 
note for a generall rule that, bloud 
letting is good against all kinde of diseases 
whiche be caused and engendred 
of bloud, not onely when the diseases ar 
present, but also it is good letting bloud 
to preuent any soche diseases if they bee 
forseen or feared, alwaies obseruinge 
that there be none of these impedime~tes 
aforesaid, whiche prohibete and forbidde 
bloud letting, except it bee in great necessitie 
and extremitie, for then as the 
prouerbe is, Necessitas non habet lege~, 
[^f.54v^] 
that is, necesitie hath no lawe. 
 
Here woulde I leaue of to speake of 
bloodlettyng, but that there commeth to 
my mynde the common opinion of the 
ignoraunt people, whiche do certainly 
beleue that if any persone bee let bloud 
one yeare, he muste bee lette bloude likewise 
[/50./] 
euery yeare, or els he is in (I can 
not tell) howe greate daunger, whiche 
fonde opinion of theirs, whereof soeuer 
it sprong at the firste, is no more like to 
be true, then I should saie, when a man 
hath a greate wound by chaunce in any 
part of his body, wherby he loseth muche 
bloud, after it is healed he muste nedes 
haue the like wou~d again the next yeare 
to auoide as muche bloud or els he is in 
daunger of greate sickenesse or of death. 
Whiche opinion if I did affirme it to be 
true (although it bee moste false) yet I 
might vse the like reason and autoritee 
to defende it, that the common people 
vse for theirs: for thei can saie nothyng, 
if thei bee asked why thei thinke so, but 
that thei haue heard many saie so. 
[^f.55r^] 
Therefore, I would wishe that no man 
should credite any longer this foolishe opinion, 
beyng moste false, vnlesse he can 
shewe good reason for it, whiche I am 
sure no manne can dooe. Marie this I 
thinke, that like as bloud lettyng is not 
good against al diseases, so also it is not 
good in all persones, but onely in those 
that will be content to vse afterwarde a 
moderate, and conuenient diet, Those 
therefore that doe abounde with bloude 
& wilbe let bloud to preserue themselfes 
from the daunger of any disease, that is 
like shortly to ensue and moleste them. 
They must longtime after bee contente 
to vse a moderate and conuenient diet, 
for those whiche be vntemperate & gluttonous 
in meates or great drinkers, and 
wyne bibbers, they do not only receiue 
no commoditie at all by bloud lettynge, 
but also often times they catche more 
hurte by it then they should haue hadde 
without it, for in three or foure dayes 
space after, thei fil and stuffe themselues 
with more rawe iuyces and humours, 
[^f.55v^] 
(by meanes of vnmesurable diet) then 
thei had before, and often times thei dye 
through conuultion, And therefore note 
that there is soche force & vertue in moderate 
diet to eschue & decline diseases, 
that without the obseruatio~ of it bloudletting 
is to no purpose. And therefore if 
the commo~ saiyng of the people be true 
in any body, that they must be let bloud 
often, if thei be ones let bloud, it is oneli 
true in soche as kepe an immoderate diet 
streight after bloud letting, and therfore 
I counsaile all men to beware of excesse 
in eating and drinking after bloud 
lettyng. Also note y=t= after bloud letting, 
none ought to walke apace or to runne, 
or to vse any vehement exercise, but let 
him be quiet and reste him self vntill his 
spirites be refreshed and quieted again. 
Note also, that nonne ought to slepe immediatly 
after bloudletting, but let him 
kepe himselfe quiet & watche, auoyding 
all contencion and exercise of bodie and 
mynde. About twoo houres after bloud 
letting, there may a little foode be taken, 
[^f.56r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.55.^] 
but let it be soche as wil make good iuice 
and nourishe a pace, within .iiij. howers 
after bloud letting or somewhat afore, it 
may be permitted to the pacient to slepe, 
so that it be prouided for and taken hede 
of, that he turne him not vpon the arme 
where the vaine was opened, nor that he 
doe not loosen the bande, and so lette the 
bloud flowe out again. Afterward lette 
him vse a straight and sparing diet, daily 
encreasing it be little and little, vntill 
you be come to your accustomed diet. 
 
And note that the morning is the metest 
tyme for blood lettyng, when euery 
digestion is perfectly finished, and the superfluities 
and excrementes of eche of 
them auoided out, whiche must be foreseen 
that thei be so. Or at the leaste in a 
time of necessitie the next apt time to let 
bloud is, when the stomacke is somwhat 
emptie, that is, sixe or eight houres after 
meate. Thus moche for bloudletting. 
Now for pourgyng, whose vse and commodities, 
I promised to declare. 
 
It is to bee noted, that euery kynde of 
[^f.56v^] 
purgation hath that secrete vertue and 
propertie in it self, that when it is receiued 
in a mans body and is prouoked to 
exercise, the vertue that it hath by naturall 
heate labouring to digeste it, then it 
draweth vnto it soche humour as it hath 
power and vertue to pourge. And therfore 
a pourgation is an euacuatio~ of vitious 
& corrupt humours, whiche trouble 
and moleste the bodie, but not of all 
corrupte humours alike. For eche pourging 
medicine doth draw vnto it one peculier 
& proper humour, (that is) either 
fleme or choler or melancholie, or waterie 
[/51./] 
humours. And therefore those that 
be perfectly in health, ought not to take 
a pourgation, since they doe not abounde 
with corrupte humours, wherefore in 
those when the medicine findeth no soch 
superfluous humours as it hath vertue 
to drawe, it consumeth and wasteth the 
bloud and the fleshe. And for that cause, 
whole folkes are not pourged by pourgations, 
but rather consumed & wasted, 
for it is manifest hereby, that pourgations 
[^f.57r^] 
be very perillous to them that bee 
in perfect health, whiche thinge is testified 
also of Hippocrates in the .xxxvij. 
Aphorisme, of his seconde booke, where 
[/52./] 
he saieth after this sorte. Qui corpore 
bene se habent hos purgare periculosum 
est, (that is) it is daungerous pourging 
of those that be in perfect health. Also because 
eche pourging medicine hath vertue 
to drawe one peculier humour, ther 
is good hede to be take~ that soche a medicine 
bee ministered, as hath vertue to 
drawe the humour abounding, and no 
other, or els in stede of moch good which 
it would do if it were conueniently ministred, 
it may contrariwyse doe moche 
hurte. According to the saiyng of Hipocrates 
in the last Aphorisme of his firste 
booke in this maner. Si qualia oportet 
purgari purgentur, confert, & facile ferunt, 
[/53./] 
si contra difficulter, that is, if soche 
thinges be purged as ought to be, it profiteth, 
and may easely be suffered, but if 
it bee contrariwise, it hurteth and may 
scarselie be borne, wherefore ther ought 
[^f.57v^] 
diligent hede to be take~ in the receiuing 
of a purgation, that it be ministred by a 
skilfull Phisicion, that hath certainly 
founde out what humour it is that haboundeth. 
But alas the greatest noumber 
of the common people doe holde an 
opinion, that if thei maie haue a medicine 
for a little money, whiche will prouoke 
them often to the stoole, what humour 
soeuer it pourgeth out, they are 
[/54./] 
safe inough: how bee it, I would wishe 
the~ hereafter alwayes to haue in minde 
this saiyng of the moste excellent Phisicion 
Hipocrates in the xxiij. Aphorisme 
of the first booke, Deiectionas non 
multitudine sunt estimanda, sed si talia 
deiiciantur, qualia conueniunt that is: 
egestions are not to be estemed for their 
greate qua~titie, but if soche humours be 
pourged out as ought to be (that is) soch 
vitious and corrupt humours as doe abounde 
and be superfluous in mannes 
body. There be diuerse thinges to be co~sidered 
of a Phisicion before he minister 
a purgation, as the qaulitie of the humour, 
[^f.58r^] 
the strengthe of the sicke, the age, 
the time of the yeare, & the disease. The 
quantitie of the humour is to bee cosidered, 
that he may knowe what kinde of 
humour is to be euacuate, and pourged 
out, for it must be onely that which troubleth 
the bodie with superfluous abou~daunce 
thereof. As if fleme doe abounde 
and trouble the bodie, he must minister 
a medicen, whiche purgeth fleme, and so 
likewise for other humours abounding 
The minister of medicen ought to haue 
respecte to the strengthe of the sicke, for if 
he be very weake and feble, there ought 
no purgation to be ministred vnto him, 
[/55./] 
because all purgations doe weaken nature 
and deminishe strengthe, and the 
stronger they bee, the more the weken. 
Let all men therfore beware of veheme~t 
and strong purgatio~s, lest they put their 
life in hasarde and daunger. By the age 
of the patient, the Phisicion is put in 
minde that children and old men ought 
not to receiue purgations, except great 
necessitie require it. The tyme of the 
[^f.58v^] 
yere is not to bee neglected, for there bee 
sometymes of the yere, wherein purgacions 
ought not to bee ministered, as in 
[/56./] 
Sommer, specially the Dogge daies, as 
thei are commonlie called, duryng the 
tyme that the Sunne is in Leo, for then 
is Nature burnte vp and made weake, 
that she is not able to suffer the force and 
violence of a purgacion, but the Spryng 
tyme is moste apte for Purgacions, because 
it is te~perate. Last of all, the Phisicion 
ought diligently to beholde & contemplate 
the disease, that he knowyng 
what kinde of disease it is, maie the better 
finde out of what humour it is caused. 
[/57./] 
As for example, if the Phisicion perceiue 
the disease to bee a tercian Feuer, 
straight waie he knoweth that it is caused 
of aboundaunde of choler, and therefore 
he must minister a medicin to purge 
choler, and so forthe in other diseases. 
 
Note, that if there bee none of the impedimentes 
aboue named, a purgacion 
is good to bee ministered, to all soche as 
haue aboundaunce of euill iuice or corrupt 
[^f.59r^] 
humours in y=e= bodie, for it draweth 
out the humour that doeth moleste, and 
thereby restoreth the bodie to his naturall 
estate again. But if a purgation be 
rashely ministred, either to one that nedeth 
it not, or at an vnmete time, or that 
it be soche a medicine as draweth not out 
the humour whiche then aboundeth, or 
[/58./] 
if the medicine bee vehement and very 
strong, it will surely put the pacient in 
daunger of his life. These thinges therfore 
ought to be well taken hede of by al 
men, lest they catche great hurte, when 
they hope for some profite. But if a purgation 
bee ministred discretely to hym 
that hath nede of it in due time, & by an 
apte medicine, whiche is able to drawe 
out the abounding humour in sufficient 
quanittie, then dooeth the medicene singuler 
commodities to the bodie, for it 
euacuateth and emptieth out all the causes 
of diseases and sicknesses, either present 
or to come, being engendred of any 
superfluous or corrupt humour, as bee 
feuers, tertians, quartains, quotidians, 
[^f.59v^] 
fluxes caused of rawe humours or sharp 
choler, Dropsies, Goutes, Palsies, Litargies, 
and diuerse other. Note that before 
[/59./] 
a purgatio~ be ministred, ther ought 
a medicine to be taken, whiche shoulde 
prepare the body & make it apt to purge, 
and therfore it is called a preparatiue, it 
is geuen for two causes, either to deuide 
extenuate, and make thinne, grosse and 
clammy humours, that thei maie be redie 
to flowe out, whe~ the medicine draweth 
them, or els it is geuen to open and 
vnstoppe the co~duites and vessels of the 
body, by which y=e= purgation must drawe 
the superfluous humour to it. And this 
is that whiche Hipocrates doth counsail 
in the first Aphorisme of this seco~d booke 
where he saith, Corpore cum qusq~; purgare 
voluerit, oportet fluuia facere, that 
is, when any man will pourge the body, 
he must make it flowing by opening & 
[/60./] 
vnopening the vessels. The moste mete 
time to receiue a purgation, is the morning, 
for then are all the digestions perfectly 
finished, and the stomake is without 
[^f.60r^] 
meate, there is hede to be taken, in 
what signe the Moone is before a purgatio~ 
be ministred, for some signes are good 
for it, and some are euill, whiche are declared 
in the table before, so that if any 
man desire to knowe a mete time for to 
pourge, there he may learne it. A purgation 
must be taken hote, for so it offendeth 
the stomack lesse, and it will worke 
the soner. Those that be apt to vomite, 
and are offended with the smell of the 
purgation, let the~ stoppe there nosethrilles 
[/61./] 
or smell some odoriferous thinge in 
taking of it. As soone as it is taken it is 
good to smell to a toste of browne bred 
dipped in vineger, & applie warme clothes 
to the stomake, and to washe the 
mouthe straighte after it is taken with 
odoriferous wine, or to chewe swete & 
pleasaunt things to take away the horrible 
taste of y=t= medicine, by this meanes 
vometyng shalbee eschewed. For one 
howers space, after the purgation is taken, 
let the paciente sitte still, and keepe 
hymself quiet and without slepe, that the 
[^f.60v^] 
strengthe of the medicine may passe to 
all partes of the body, if the purgation 
worke slowely, lette him walke vp and 
downe a good space if he can. When it 
worketh, in any case there must be hede 
taken that the pacient doe not slepe, for 
so the operation of the medicine woulde 
be stopped. Also in the time of pourging, 
immoderate heate and colde are to bee 
eschued, and therfore a very greate fier, 
and the colde and open aire are bothe 
hurtefull, for the bodie must be kept in a 
temperate heate. After that the purgation 
[/62./] 
is taken, except the stomake be very 
weake, it is beste not to eate any thing, 
lest the operation of the medicine should 
be hindred. After that the purgatio~ hath 
doon working, the patient must be nourished 
with a meane quantitie of some 
broth that will breede good iuice, and be 
easely digested, and after by little and litle, 
returne to his accustomed diet. 
 
Thus haue I as briefly as I coulde, 
declared the commodities of bloud letting 
and pourging, being well and duely 
[^f.61r^] 
ministred and vsed, and the disco~modities 
that will ensue of the~ both if they 
be at any time misused, wishing al men 
as they tender there health and life, to 
beware of those ignorau~t persones that 
[/63./] 
vse to epen but one kinde of vaine for al 
diseases, & occupie but one kinde of purgation 
againste all humours not considering 
at all, the time the strengthe, and 
age of the patient, nor the cause of the disease, 
nor any other of the circumstaunces 
afore named, but let theim seke for 
the counsaile and aide of one that 
is skilfull in phisicke, and circu~specte 
in his doinges. Who 
can cosider what neede 
they haue, and what 
is moste mete to be 
ministred vnto 
theim.
