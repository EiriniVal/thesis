[}Iohn.}] 
OF al pleasures and pastimes 
[/1./] 
mee thinke there is none 
like vnto good cheere, 
what shoulde a man doe 
but passe away the time 
with good fellowes, and make merrie, 
seeing we haue but a time to liue, cast 
away care, wherefore is meate and bellies 
ordained, but the one to serue the 
other? The flesh that we dayly encrease 
is our owne. Abstinence and fasting, is 
a mightie enemie and nothing pleasant 
to mee, and bee vsed of very fewe 
that loue themselues, but onely of beggers, 
and couetous sparers, which doe 
spare much, and spend little. 
 
[}Humfrey.}] I know well your goodly 
expence of time, I wis it is no maruell, 
although you make your bellie 
your god, and boast of it. You see that 
all lustie reuellers, and continual banket 
makers, come to great estimation, 
as for example, Varius Hælyogabalus, 
[^f.1v^] 
which was dayly fedde with many 
hundred fishes and foules, and was accompanied 
with manie brothels, 
baudes, harlots and gluttons, and thus 
it doeth appeare by your abhorring 
vertue, that of right you might haue 
[/2./] 
claimed a great office in Hæliogabalus 
court, if you had beene in those 
daies, but you haue an infinite number 
of your conuersation in these dayes, 
the more pitie. 
 
[}Iohn.}] What? good sir, I require 
not your counsell, I pray you bee 
your owne caruer, and giue mee leaue 
to serue my fantasie. I will not charge 
you, you are verie auncient and graue, 
and I am but young, wee be no matches. 
 
[}Hum.}] Good counsell is a treasure 
to wise men, but a verie trifle to a 
foole, if thou haddest seene those things 
which I haue seene. I knowe thou 
wouldest not be such a man, nor thus 
spend thy time. 
 
[}Iohn.}] What hast thou seene, that I 
haue not seene? 
 
[}Hum.}] I haue seene many notable 
and grieuous plagues, which haue 
[^f.2r^] 
fallen vpon greedie gluttons, as wasting 
their substance, disforming their 
bodies, shortning their pleasant daies: 
[/3./] 
and in this poynt to conclude with 
thee, whereas gluttonie remaineth, 
from thence is moderate diet banished: 
and those bellies that follow 
the lust of the eyes (in meates) in 
youth, shall lacke the health of all 
their bodies, in age if they liue so 
long. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Mee thinke thou canst giue 
good counsell, thou seemest to be seene 
in phisicke. I pray thee, is it so great 
hurt to delight in plentie of banquets? 
 
[}Hum.}] Sir, if it will please you to 
[/4./] 
bee somewhat attentiue, I will tell 
you. It is the verie graine whereof 
commeth stinking vomits, sausy faces, 
dropsies, vertigo, palsies, obstructions, 
blindnes, flixes, apoplexis, caters, and 
rheumes, &c. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Is it true that you haue said to 
mee? 
 
[}Hum.}] Would to God dayly experience 
did not trie it. I doe perfectly 
know it. And once thou shalt be a witnesse 
thereof, if thou come to age. 
 
[^f.2v^] 
[}Iohn.}] Then I beseech thee gentle 
friend Humfrey, declare to mee, whie 
there is such diuision among Phisitions. 
 
[}Hum.}] Thou seest among the Theologians 
there is much varietie, and 
[/5./] 
yet but one truth. Discords bee soone 
knowne of Musitions, and the Physitions 
be not ignorant of the generall 
natures of things. No diuision is although 
it doe so appeare: for regents, 
place, age, time, and the present state 
of mans nature must bee obserued, and 
not the olde rules in all poynts. For 
mans nature is sore altered and changed, 
into a viler sort than it was woont 
to bee. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Some doe report that men of 
[/6./] 
great estimation say: what needeth phisicke, 
it is but an inuention only for money, 
we see (say they) who liueth so wel, 
as they which neuer knewe phisicke, 
and so euill as these pothicarie men? 
 
[}Hum.}] Many men be more rich than 
wise, and more esteemed for titles of 
their honours and worships, than for 
any other vertue or cunning, such 
men in some pointes, be more ingratefull 
to naturall remedies than dogges: 
[^f.3r^] 
which can elect or choose their vomitting 
grasse, or birdes which can choose 
grauell or stones for their casting. 
But to conclude with thee in this matter, 
Plinie the great clearke, hath a 
thousand reasons, to proue them foolish 
[/7./] 
that will obiect agaynst physicke. And 
the authour of all things did well foresee 
[/8./] 
and knowe, what was good for 
mans nature, when hee stretched out 
so large a compasse round about the 
earth, with the noble Planets and 
signes, and their courses, influences 
and heauenly qualities, and garnished 
the earth with fruits, hearbs, flowers, 
leaues, graines, oyles, gums, stones, 
for mans comfort and helpe, and ordained 
the Physition for to helpe man. 
Thus the Almightie hath done (sayeth 
[/9./] 
Salomon.) And in recompence, God 
hath not appointed the Phisitions to 
be rayled vpon, or despised, but honoured 
[/10./] 
and rewarded: yea, esteemed of 
princes. And seeing good nature and 
wise men bee on my side: I force not 
of other mens phantasies, with whom 
neither good wisedome, nor good nature 
is guide. 
 
[^f.3v^] 
[}Ioh.}] Why is phisicke of such great authoritie, 
or hath it bin in estimation 
among olde fathers, May that be proued 
of thy parte? 
 
[}Hum.}] Yea that I can. 
 
[}Ioh.}] If thou canst bring in any reuerent 
fathers that loued phisick, I will 
not despise, but greatly esteme it, and 
desire counsell in demaunding of a fewe 
questions. 
 
[/11./] 
[}Hum.}] Phisicke hath beene in so hie 
an estimation, that the Gentiles did al 
consent, it came from the immortall 
gods. The Hebrues did well knowe it, 
[/12./] 
as Moises in the most auncient booke, 
called Genesis primo, doth describe the 
worke of the almightie God: of herbs, 
[/13./] 
fruites, and plantes, that Adam might 
teach the vertues of the~ to his children. 
[/14./] 
Iesus Sirack which was endued with 
the spirit of God hath lefte a laude behinde 
him greatlie commending Phisicke 
amongest the diuines of the Hebrues, 
[/15./] 
Mercurie amongest the Egiptians, 
Ouid doeth greatly commende 
Apollo, the inuenter of herbes, when 
they were almost out of memorie, he 
reuiued their vertues, and taught 
[^f.4r^] 
their nature to others that followed 
him. After that came in Aesculapius, 
which did many most excellent cures. 
[/16./] 
And Chiron, the instructer of Achilles, 
whose name can neuer die as long as 
the herbs Centauri, groweth vpon the 
earth, which is called after his name. 
Podaliri~us, & Mechaon, were two brethren, 
[/17./] 
in the time of the battel of Troy 
which were excellent Phisitions, and 
be greatly commended of Homer, who 
was more excellent than Hippocrates, 
[/18./] 
in the Ile of Coose: whose works 
will neuer die, for he brought in Phisicke, 
and digested it into faire bookes, 
for mans great health. Then came 
Galen, not vnknowne to all wise 
[/19./] 
and learned Phisitions. I coulde 
rehearse manie moe, but this shall 
suffise to prooue Phisicke to bee of 
greate authoritie amongst the olde fathers. 
 
[}Ioh.}] I pray thee friend Humfrey, 
what is phisicke? I would bee glad to 
learne some of thy knowledge, for thou 
hast a good order in talking, and seeme 
to be grounded of authority. Therfore I 
am sory that I haue co~tended with thee: 
 
[^Folio 4v-5r is missing from the original book.^] 
[^f.5v^] 
the aire, the time of the yeare, the 
custome of people, the maners of diseases, 
the fashions of mens diet. And 
this they will proue by true arguments 
and reasons, and will bee verie 
carefull for their patientes The disciples 
of those men, be the best scholers, 
therefore I counsell thee Iohn to loue 
wel Hippocrates the prince of Phisitions, 
[/20./] 
which began the best maner to 
giue rules to al the louers of phisicke. 
Of this writeth Galen, much lauding 
Hippocrates and his followers, and in 
these daies Leonhardus Futchius, Matheolus, 
&c. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Seeing thou hast spoken of 
sundrie partes of Phisitions, I pray thee 
what partes be there of phisicke? 
 
[}Hum.}] Truly there be fiue thinges 
[/21./] 
to be noted in phisicke, as fiue principall 
parts, as Galen saith: in lib. de 
[/22./] 
Elementis. The first is, to consider the 
nature of mans bodie. The second is, to 
keepe the bodie in health, and so defend 
it from sickenes and infirmities. The 
third is, to know all the causes, rules, 
and seedes, whereof the sicknes doth 
grow. The .iiii is Crises or iudgeme~t 
[^f.6r^] 
of the disease of thinges present, past 
and to come. The fifth is the best and 
most excelle~t, for it sheweth the maner 
of healing, dieting, fashion, order, and 
way to helpe the sicke bodie, and preserue 
the same, as long as man doth 
remaine in the state of life. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Thou hast spoken of the partes 
of phisicke, what is the forme maner or 
distribution thereof? 
 
[}Hum.}] It is distributed in 3. formes, 
one is natural, another vnnatural, the 
[/23./] 
iii. against nature. The first is, by 
those things whereof the body is compact, 
constituted or made, as Galen 
saith: in his .iii. booke of his Temperamentis. 
Cap. 4. The second is called 
not natural, as meates or things to 
preserue the bodie in health, they be 
not called vnnaturall, because they be 
against the bodie, but because the rash 
taking, or glotonous vsing of th~, may 
bring many thinges to the vtter destruction 
of the bodie. The third, bee 
things against nature, which doth corrupt 
the bodie or poison nature wherof 
Galen writeth. 
[/24./] 
 
[^f.6v^] 
[}Ioh.}] Now thou hast taught me short 
rules of the partes and formes phisicall, 
I pray thee shewe me some pretie rules 
of the complections of men, and that I 
may aptly knowe them with their properties, 
elements, temperaments, and 
humours. 
 
[}Hum.}] Upon my Lute some time, to 
recreate myselfe, I ioine with my simple 
harmonie, many plaine verses. Among 
all other one small song of the 
foure complections: wilt thou heare it? 
take that chaire and sit downe, and I 
I will teach thee my song. 
 
[}Ioh.}] I thanke thee. 
 
[}Humfrey.}] 
The bodies where heat and moysture dwel, 
Be sanguine folkes as Galen tell, 
With visage faire and cheekes rose ruddy. 
The sleepes is much & dreames be bluddy. 
[/25./] 
Pulse great and full, with digestion fine, 
Pleasantly concocting flesh and wine. 
Excrements aboundant, with anger short, 
Laughing very much and finding sport, 
Vrine grosse, with colour red: 
Pleasant folkes at boord and bed. 
[^f.7r^] 
Where cold with moisture preuaileth 
Flegmatike folks be alwaies such, (much, 
[/26./] 
Fatnes softnes, haire plaine and right, 
Narrow veines and colour white, 
Dull of wit, no heart, too bold, 
Pulse very slow, disgestion cold, 
Sleeping ouer much, vrine grosse and pale, 
Spittle white and thicke thus ends the tale. 
 
Choler is hot and drie as fire, 
Leannesse of lims and puffed with ire. 
Costiue bellies with lite sleepe. 
Dreames of fier, or wounds deepe. 
[/27./] 
Sallowe coloured, or tawrie red, 
Feeding on salt meats, and crustes of bread, 
Voice sharpe, and quickenes of wit, 
Vrine yellow and saltnes of spit, 
Pulses swift, and verie strong, 
Cruell countenance, not anger long. 
 
Melancholy is cold, and very drie. 
As here in rime the signes will trie, 
Haire plaine, and verie thin, 
[/28./] 
A leane wretch with hardnes of skin. 
Colour whitelie, or like to lead, 
Much watch, and dreames of dread, 
And stiffe in folish fantasie, 
Disgestion slowe, and long angrie. 
Fearefull of minde, with watrie spitle. 
Seldome laughing, and pulse little 
[^f.7v^] 
Vrine waterie, and verie thin, 
The colde earth, to him is kin. 
 
[}Ioh.}] This is a good song, and I will 
learne it, for though it seeme not verie 
pleasant, yet I perceiue it is profitable. 
Now thou hast spoken of the signes of 
the .4. complections, I praie thee teach 
mee shortly, howe to knowe the elements. 
 
[/29./] 
[}Hum.}] They be the foure beginners 
vnmingled and vntempered, from 
whose mixtures euerie corporall thing 
hath his substance. 
 
[}Ioh.}] What be the partes? I pray 
thee tel me. 
 
[}Hum.}] Foure, the one is earth the 
heauiest matter and grossest, which is 
colde & drie, and melancholy. And the 
other is water, which is lighter and 
[/30./] 
more subtil then the earth, and of nature 
is cold, moist, and fleugmeticke. 
Then is ayre more purer and lighter 
then water, and if it bee not altered 
[/31./] 
with any other straunge cause, it is 
hot and moist and sanguine: Then fier 
is most light, pure and cleare, a clarifier 
and a clenser of al the other elementes, 
when they are corrupted, and is of his 
[^f.8r^] 
owne nature hote, drie, and cholericke. 
 
And of these foure Elements, both 
man, beast, fishes, foule, hearbe, stone, 
mettall, haue their proper working, 
not of one of the Elementes alone, but 
of all: some more and some lesse, according 
to their natures. 
 
Hippocrates saieth: after the soule is 
[/32./] 
gone from the bodie, the body doeth 
returne to the first matter whereof it 
was made: And to conclude, all things 
that be made vpon earth, shall returne 
vnto the earth againe in tyme. 
 
[}Ioh.}] What, might not men, beasts, 
fish or foule, hearbe or tree, bee of one 
element aswell as of foure? I pray you 
tell me. 
 
[}Hum.}] No, for Aristotle saith: Deus 
& natura nihil agunt frustra, God and 
nature hath doone nothing in vaine. 
And if any thing vpon the earth sencible 
[/33./] 
were of one element, no sicknesse 
could hurte it, nor disease corrupt it, 
but euerie thing liuing vppon the 
earth, seeing it hath had beginning, 
it must needes haue ending, to whom 
these foure complexions doeth belong 
[^f.8v^] 
if they do greatly abound or diminish 
or withdraw their vertues with quantities 
or qualities. 
 
[}Ioh.}] May a man see any of the Elements? 
 
[}Hum.}] The thing which men do see 
be none of the foure Elements: not 
earth, but earthie, not water, but watrie, 
not ayre, but airie, not fier, but 
firie. But the things which man doth 
[/34./] 
feele, be the foure Elements, as earth, 
aire, fier, and water. And these be the 
vttermost simples of complexions, diuersly, 
and specially, alone of them 
selues, or mingled with other, taking 
sundrie and diuers effectes, maners, 
condidions, formes and qualities, both 
in man and beast, and euery liuing 
thing, sensible and insensible. 
 
[}Ioh.}] What is the complexion of the 
quarters of the yeare, and names of 
signes? 
 
[}Hum.}] The spryng time when bloud 
[/35./] 
doeth increase: Summer when red 
colour doeth rule: Haruest when colour 
[/36./] 
aduste, or melancholy doth reigne. 
Wynter when fleugme doeth abound 
in full strength. It is called wynter 
[^f.9r^] 
from the twelfth day of December, 
vnto the tenth daie of March: This season 
is colde and moiste, it is called 
spring time, from the .xii. day of March, 
and endeth about the .xii. day of Iune. 
Summer begins about the .xii. day 
of Iune, and endeth about the .xii. day 
of September. Autumne or Haruest, 
beginneth about the .xiii. daie of September, 
and endeth about the .xi. daie 
of December. Capricornus, Aquarius, 
& Pisces, be winter signes, Aries, Taurus, 
& Gemini, be signes for the spring. 
Cancer, leo, and Virgo be the signs for 
Summer. Libra, Scorpio, and Sagitari, 
be the signes for haruest. And the sun 
goeth through al these xii. signs in xii. 
months. And y=e= Moone goeth xii. times 
through each of the foresaid signs once 
in the yeere, and do take sundry effects 
in man, beastes, and fruits, in the said 
signes: hote or cold, moist or drie. 
 
[}Ioh.}] What be the complexions of 
medicines? 
 
[}Hum.}] Those things that ouercome 
and gouerne the body, as purgations, 
expulsiues, &c. These be called medicins, 
[/37./] 
and those things that nourisheth 
[^f.9v^] 
and augmenteth the bodie, bee called 
meates. For the complexions of meats 
and medicines bee knowne by their 
tastes, as coldnes, hotnes, moistnesse, 
[/38./] 
drines, bitternes, saltnes, sweetnes, fatnes, 
sharpnes, stipticke, and clammie. 
And because thy request is to haue 
prescribed vnto thee, but onely a little 
gouernment of health: I will shewe 
vnto thee another of my little songs, 
in plaine meetre, how thou shalt know 
meates and medicines by their tastes. 
 
[}Iohn.}] That is my chiefe desire, I will 
heare thee, say on. 
 
[}Humfrey.}] 
Cold quencheth the cholers pride, 
[/39./] 
Moist humecteth that which is dried, 
The flowing moisture, by proofe I trie, 
Is wasted of humours hote and drie, 
The subtill foode, that is piersing quicke, 
The clammy meates, maketh it thicke, 
Bitter things cleanse and wipeth oft, 
And expell fleugme, and maketh soft. 
Salt drieth, and resolueth fleugme tough, 
Fat nourisheth, and makes subtile inough. 
Stiptike or rough taste on the tongue, 
Bindeth and comforteth appetite long, 
Sweet things in clensing, is very good. 
[^f.10r^] 
It dissolueth much, and nourisheth blood. 
These things well vsed, nature will please, 
But abusing them beastly, bringeth disease. 
 
[}Iohn.}] In good faith, me thinks thou 
sayest well, for there apeare perfite reasons 
in these thy prety rules. Now thou 
hast declared vnto mee, the signes of 
complexions of men: with the way 
and apt knowledge of meates by their 
tastes. I would faine learne, shortlie 
the temperaments and complections of 
mankinde. 
 
[}Hum.}] There was neuer so discreet 
nor wise phisition, that either feared 
God, or pitied mankind, or loued his 
owne honestie, would take in hand either 
to prescribe diet, or to minister 
medicin to any body, before he wel did 
consider, and wisely wey with himself, 
the temperament, mixture or co~plexion 
of mankind: first, whether he were hot 
or colde, moist or drie, fat or leane, or 
[/40./] 
indifferent betwene them both: tempered 
by health, or distempered by sicknesse, 
as the extremities of hotenesse, 
coldnesse, moistnesse, and drynesse. 
Therefore Iohn, these things may not 
bee forgotten: you must note also the 
[^f.10v^] 
foure ages of mankinde, & first the tender 
state of children, which beginneth 
at the birth, & so continueth vntill xv. 
yeres next after their said birth: Their 
temperaments or complections, be hot 
and moist, very like vnto y=e= seed wherof 
they bee procreated, then next vnto 
childhood or innoce~t age. Youth which 
is the second part of life, beginneth to 
reigne, his temperament or complection 
hath rather more firy heat, than perfite 
naturall heat, and this second age, 
[/41./] 
continueth for ten yeares, as Galen 
sayth. Well, in these two first states of 
life, let all naturall fathers & mothers 
bring vp their youth, set God before 
[/42./] 
their eyes, for they haue no smal charge 
committed vnto them, that must giue 
account to God, how they haue brought 
vp their children: and they that in these 
yeres do spare correction, truly be grieuous 
enemies vnto their children, and 
at last shalbe reco~pensed with shame, 
when they shall see misfortune & wretchednesse 
fall vpon the fruites of their 
owne seeds. For men haue smal profite 
of their corne, which be choked and ouercome 
with Thistles, Bryers, and 
[^f.11r^] 
Brakes which were not weeded in 
time, much lesse of their children, 
which haue receyued neyther correction 
nor honest learning in due season. 
If the keepers of gardens be carefull 
ouer their late sowne seedes, and 
tender hearbes, which are in daunger 
to bee destroyed of euerie frost: 
What shoulde good fathers and mothers 
doe for their children, whose 
tender and youthfull yeares bee caryed 
away, and ouercommed of euerie 
foolish fantasie, and it is no maruaile. 
But this shall suffice for the 
wise, and smally profite the fooles: 
but to my matter which I tooke in 
hande, I will returne vnto the thirde 
age of mankinde, which is called the 
lustie state of life, and beginneth at 
xxv. yeares, and continueth vnto xxxv. 
This age is hote and drie, and verie 
[/43./] 
cholericke, as Galen sayth: This 
part of life is subiect, to manie burning 
and extreeme feuers, and hote 
vlcers: therefore it is necessarie to 
knowe this temperament of complection, 
which is called cholericke, 
as plainely may appeare by age, 
[^f.11v^] 
strength, diet, vrine, &c. 
 
This is the best time for mankind 
to trauell in, with godly exercise in 
science, arte, and profitable trauelles 
in his vocation, putting in practise, 
the vertues which he hath learned in 
youth, for this is the sommer part of 
life, wherein all goodly frutes do florish 
[/44./] 
in euerie good occupation. This is 
the very haruest, to gather the precious 
corne, and the frute of their labours 
against the colde stormes and cloudie 
daies of their aged winter, wherein 
the bodie shallbe weake, and the eies 
sight decay, and the handes tremble, 
and therefore it is not comely to see 
the state of age, without rest, which in 
the time of youth, did honestly trauell. 
For there is a grace giuen to many 
creatures vnreasonable, both beastes 
and foules: to make prouision before 
hande, what is then to be required of 
men reasonable, as foloweth in these 
verses. 
 
THe Bird in time her nest can make, 
The Bee will build his house full fine, 
The Crane with stone in foot wil wake, 
[^f.12r^] 
The Conie will carue vnder the myne, 
The Squirel in trees her nuts can keepe, 
Against colde winter to feed and sleepe, 
And should not a man well foresee, 
In youth to know his old degree? 
 
Then from .xxxv. or few yeres folowing, 
the lusty braunches of youth, 
begin to abate his pleasant leaues, 
flowers and fruit by litle and litle wil 
decay, raw humors, crampes, dropses, 
quaterns, melancholy, will then draw 
neer. The riots, surfets, sore labours, 
bearing of extreame burdens, wrestling, 
actes venerous with the abuse of 
youth, wil then spring forth, to the detriment 
of age and sodaine decay of 
life, in especiall of drunkardes. 
 
[}Ioh.}] What, be the places of bloud, 
Choler, Fleugme, & Melancoly, naturall 
or vnnatrual? Thou hast not made 
a particular distinction of their proper 
places, but generally thou hast spoken 
well in thy song. 
 
[}Hum.}] There are also other descriptions 
of the foure humors very necessarie 
to bee knowen, and their places 
whereas they dwell within the 
[^f.12v^] 
body, and first of bloud, as Galen saieth: 
in his first booke of effected places, 
bloud (saieth he) that is in the pulses, 
doeth greatly differ from the bloud of 
the veines, for the bloud of the pulses 
is thinner, yelower and hotter, and 
this bloud, may bee called the gouernor 
[/45./] 
of life. The spring and fountaine of the 
bloud generall is in the liuer, which 
serueth euery veine of bloud, and 
this bloud in colour is verie redde. 
Fleugme is white, & is ingendred in 
the stomacke, and at length by the 
vertue of naturall heate, pure steame 
is turned into bloud. There be also 
watrie, slimy, glassie, grosse, salt, sower, 
thicke, hard binding, and extreme cold 
steames, which in dede be vnnaturall, 
that bee engendred thorowe surfets, 
coldnes or idlenes, bringing to the body 
many noisome deseases. There is also 
choler, which is yelowe, whose place 
in the body is the gall, which commeth 
of the clensing or purifying of 
bloud: and this choler is cleare, hote 
and drie, and the comforter of decoction. 
Greene choler, or choler myngled 
with fleugme, be vnnaturall, melancholie 
[^f.13r^] 
naturall: in the Splene 
is nothing but the sixe degrees, or heauie 
residents of the bloud, the naturall 
melancholie is knowen by his 
blackenesse, the vnnaturall commeth 
of the burning of choler, and is lighter 
and hoter, browne of colour, sower 
of taste, and putteth the bodie in great 
daunger: as madnesse, blacke ianders, 
continuall feuers, and sodaine deadly 
diseases. Therefore my friend Iohn, 
remember this short description of humours, 
[/46./] 
as the wordes of Galen and Auicen 
say. 
 
[}Iohn.}] Thus I haue heard thy seuerall 
placing of the foure complections 
of bloud, Choler, Fleugme and 
Melancholie, and is there anie distinct 
hotenesse, coldnesse, moystnesse, and 
drinesse, in anie other creature besides 
man? tell me. 
 
[}Hum.}] Not onely in man, but 
in beastes, fish, foule, serpents, trees, 
hearbes, mettals, and euerie thing 
sensible and insensible, according to 
their natures, and bee equally mingled 
or tempered togither, which is called 
meane temperance, or else exceedeth 
[^f.13v^] 
in degrees, which is called intemperance, 
hote and moist, may be compounded 
together, so may colde and 
drie, hote and drie, colde and moist 
example, A cholericke man, hote and 
[/47./] 
drie: a fleugmatike man, colde and 
moyst, &c. Of hearbes, as Hysope and 
Rew, hot and drie, Purslen and Cowcumbers, 
cold and moist, &c. But temperaments 
or complections of men, 
beasts, and trees, be some hoter, some 
colder, according to their natures. As 
a Lion is hoter than a cholericke man, 
Pepper is hotter than Cloues. And 
though there be degrees in more hotnesse 
or more coldnesse, yet they are 
called but hote or cold, as men after labour 
or trauell, they will say they are 
hot, but the fire which people warme 
them at, is hotter. 
 
Also there bee things repugnant 
to temperaments, as moyste and 
drynesse together, heate and coldenesse 
together, as fyre to bee colde 
or the water of his owne nature to 
bee hote, which water peraccidence 
of the fire is made hot: and fire 
quenched by the water. And euerie 
[^f.14r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.13.^] 
thing exceeding greatly with distemperaunce 
or wanting temperaunce or 
complexion, do eftsoones come to an 
end, as man by extreme sicknesses, 
surfets or woundes, or finally age, 
lacking naturall vertue. Of heate and 
moistnes of trees and hearbes, from 
whom iuice and sap is withdrawen, 
[/48./] 
these things of necessitie must needes 
die, and come to corruption, as Galen 
and Aristotle saie. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Whether be men or women of 
colder complexion? 
 
[/49./] 
[}Hum.}] Auicen saieth: like as men 
be hot an drie, so be women colde and 
moist. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Yea but Lucian, saieth: they be 
perillous hot of their tongues & full of 
venim: though I am no phisicion, yet 
can I make a description of that member, 
[/50./] 
for I am oftentimes stinged with 
it, I would to God they had beene wormed 
when they were young, but when 
they are olde, they are past all cure: but 
the best medicine that I haue, it is a 
gentle herbe called Rewe, of which I 
am neuer without great store. 
 
[}Hum.}] Mankinde was borne naked 
[^f.14v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.13.^] 
to this ende, that hee might cloathe 
[/51./] 
himselfe with other creatures: which 
hee brought not into this world with 
him, as cloath, leather, harnesse 
made of iron, for his defence, because 
he is the chiefe creature. But horses 
of nature haue hard hooffes, Lions 
sharpe teeth, Porpentines sharp 
prickes, which is their continuall and 
naturall armour, as thinges euer 
prepared to debate and strife, and 
by no Art can scant bee tamed. The 
Rose as pleasauntly as shee doeth appeare, 
and as sweetely as shee doeth 
smell, spring not further without a 
greate number of sharpe prickes. 
Therefore it is tollerable for men to 
beare with them whom nature hath 
sealed and marked for his owne. 
With that humour most cholericke, 
digresse from this thy communication, 
and let vs talke of thinges more profitable, 
for in deede this is pleasant to 
no man. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Seeing thou wilt not describe 
me these particular members, of which 
wee haue spoken, I would bee glad to 
know the partes of mankinde, with a 
[^f.15r^] 
short description of his members. 
 
[}Hum.}] Members be simple and also 
compound, the simples be ten in number, 
the cartillages, the gristles, the 
bones, veynes, and synewes, arteries, 
pannicles, lygaments, cordes, 
[/52./] 
and the skinne. Members compounded, 
bee those that be ioyned and builded 
together of simple members, as the 
handes, face, feete, lyuer, and heart, 
and so compounded members be made 
of simple. 
 
Some of the compounded members 
be called principalles: as the heart 
from whence the arteries springs, the 
braine, from whence the sinewes 
springes, the liuer which is the well of 
the bloud, from whence the veines doe 
spring, and the stones of generation 
from whence the seed of life springeth: 
but those compounded members that 
bee principall bee all the other members 
except the simple, as the nose, the 
eares, the eies, the face, the necke, the 
armes and legges, and the braines and 
chiefe substaunce of our flesh, bee compounded: 
members of sinewes, and 
couered with panacles which bee of a 
[^f.15v^] 
sinew nature, but that sinewes giue 
feeling to all the whole bodie: euen as 
the arteries giueth sprituall bloud 
from the heart to euerie member. The 
whole body is couered with filmes and 
skinnes. Out of the head springeth 
hard matter issuing from the place 
called the pores, to purge vapours and 
smoke from the braine, which ascendeth 
out of the stomacke into the heart 
and is cleansed through pia mater, called 
the tender couering of the braine 
or spirites animall. And therefore as 
some partes of the bodie being diuided 
in sunder, be each like vnto the other 
and yet called by the name of the 
whole, as for example: When the 
bones be broken in sunder, or the flesh 
cut into diuerse peeces, or the bloud 
[/53./] 
powred into sundrie vessels, a peece 
of flesh is still called flesh, a fragment 
of a bone, is called a bone, and a drop 
of blood is called bloud: Euen so a 
hande, arme, veyne, or such like vnseparate 
partes beeing diuided into 
peeces, or called by the name of the peeces 
and not by the name of the whole 
part (as is before). But my friend 
[^f.16r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.15.^] 
Iohn, to make a large description of 
Anatomie, it were too long for mee, 
but shortly I will say some thing. And 
first, the definition thereof is, when 
the bodie of a dead man or woman, 
[/54./] 
is cut and opened and the members 
diuided, or for the want of dead bodies 
to reade good bookes, as Galen, Auicen, 
&c. And it behooueth them that 
cutteth a deade corpse, to note foure 
[/55./] 
things. First, the nutrimentall members, 
as the liuer with the veynes: 
the second is, the members spirituall, 
[/56./] 
as the heart with the arteries: the 
third is, the animall members, as the 
head, braines and sinewes: the fourth 
and last, be excrements of the bodie, as 
armes, legges, skin, haire &c. Of these 
said members, with the bones, is all 
the bodie compounded. And like as 
euerie tree and hearbe, haue their 
rootes in the earth, and their braunches 
springeth vpward, euen so the 
rootes of mankinde, haue the beginning 
in the braine, and the sinew and 
branches groweth downeward: in the 
which braine, dwelleth the vertues of 
imagination, fantasie, memorie, &c. 
[^f.16v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.15.^] 
And these animall vertues, be placed 
as it were heauenly aboue al the members, 
communicating their heauenly 
influences, down vnto the heart, as to a 
prince, or chiefe ruler within the body 
which giueth life to euery part therin. 
Thou shalt consider, that the hart was 
the first that receiued life from the sporites, 
and shalbe the last that shall die. 
Note also, that as there be noble sence 
giuen to the body, as seeing, hearing, 
smelling, tasting, feeling: euen so nature 
hath foure principall vertues: 
first Attractiue, the second Retentiue, 
the third Digestiue, the fourth Expositiue. 
Attractiue is that by the which euery 
part of the body draweth the fuel 
of life, & serueth the vertue disgestiue 
and the Retentiue doeth holde the 
meate vntill it be readie to be altered 
and changed. Digestiue doth alter, and 
maketh the foode like vnto the thing 
that it nourisheth, as fleme, bloud, &c. 
Expulsiue separateth them from the 
other, the good from the bad. Thou 
oughteth also most chiefly to learne the 
knowledge of the veines, and for what 
sicknesse, they must be opened, and 
[^f.17r^] 
what medicins either in sirups or pils 
thou must vse. And first marke this figure 
of the Anatomie here present before 
thee, with the heauenly signes, because 
I haue not painted at large the 
seuerall parts of the said Anatomie. 
[^A picture of the Zodiac man omitted.^] 
 
[^f.17v^] 
The middle veine of the forehead 
is good to be opened against Megrim, 
forgetfulnes, & passions of the head. 
And they that be let blood of this, or any 
other veyne, must first haue their head 
purged with pillule Chochi Rasis, or 
some purgation, but first vse thinges to 
extenuate matter, as syruppe of Buglosse, 
&c. 
 
Against Leprosy and deafnes. Let 
bloud the two veines behind the eares 
and vse the said pilles or els pillule 
Aurea Nicholai or Arabice, or co~fectio 
Hameth minor. 
 
Against replexion or too much blood, 
or bloud in the eies, flowing in the 
head, vpon the temple veines called 
Artiers, for they bee euer beating. And 
vse to purge with pillule Artritice Nicholai 
or puluis, ad epithema Hepatis. 
 
Against Squinancie, stopping the 
throte, and stopping of the breath: Let 
bloud the veines vnder the tongue. 
And for this vse Philoniumaius Necholai 
and Gargarismes pilule Bechie 
and oxymel Simplex. 
 
Ueines called Originales, open not 
[^f.18r^] 
without great counsaile of a learned 
Physicion, or cunning Chirurgion. 
They be in the necke, and haue a great 
course of bloud, that gouerneth the 
head, and the whole body. 
 
Against short winde, and euill bloud 
aproching to the heart, and spitting 
bloud. Open the vaine called Corbiaca, 
or heart veine, in the arme. Use 
thinges to extenuate, as Aromaticum. 
Chariophillatum Mesue, serapium ex 
Absinthij in colde time, serapium Boraginis 
hote time, and pillle stomachi. 
 
Agaynst palsie, yellow Iaundies, 
burning heats, and apostumations of 
the liuer. Open the liuer vein vpon the 
right arme. Take Serapium ex endiue, 
Diamargariton frigidum Auicennie. 
 
Against dropsy, open the veine betweene 
[/57./] 
the belly and the braunch, the 
right side against the said dropsy, and 
the left side against the passions of the 
milte, but bee not rash, vnlesse ye haue 
the consaile of one well seene in the 
Anothomie. Use pillule Hiere cum 
Agarico. 
[/58./] 
 
Agaynst the stopping the secrete 
[^f.18v^] 
tearmes or fluxions of women, or helping 
the Emerods, and purging sores, 
Open the veine called Sophane vnder 
[/59./] 
the ancle. Theriaca Andromachi, Pillule, 
Mastichine, Petri de Ebano. 
 
Within twentie houres after one 
is infected with the pestilence, comming 
sodenly: Open the vein between 
the wrest of the foote, and the great toe. 
Use Serapium Cichorij, and Pillule 
pestilentialis Ruffi. 
 
Against stinking breath: Open the 
veyne betweene the lip, and the chin. 
Use for this Catharicum imperiale. Nicho. 
Alexandri. 
 
Against the toothake: Open the 
veine in the roofe of the mouth. And 
first purge with Pillule. Choci Rasis, or 
with pilles of masticke. 
 
[/60./] 
Against quartens, tercians, and 
paines of the left side: Open the splene 
veine, commonly called the low veine, 
with a wide cut, and not deepe; For 
Chirurgions nicely pricking or opening 
veynes, with little Scarisfactions, 
doe let out good pure bloud, and 
still retaine, grosse, colde, and drie 
earthly matter, to the great hurt of 
[^f.19r^] 
their patients. And albeit many more 
veynes might here be spoken of, and 
thier vtilities, yet this shall well suffice 
by Gods grace to keepe all people 
in health, that vpon iust cause haue 
these veynes opened: except olde men, 
women with childe, and children, vnder 
xiiii. yeares of age, or men after 
diuerse agues. For bloud letting, will 
then engender perillous palsies, as verie 
excellent Phisitions haue well declared. 
And after one be infected with 
the pestilence xxiiii. houres, before hee 
[/61./] 
haue receyued medicine, or bloud letting, 
miracle helpeth him, but truly no 
medicine hath vertue to doe it. 
 
[}Ioh.}] This same figure although it 
appeareth in many bookes: yet verie 
fewe do vnderstand it in all points, such 
be the secrete workes of nature. And 
whereas thou hast well spoken of some 
veynes, and apt medicines for the body: 
I would faine see the true forme and 
shape of the bones. 
 
[}Hum.}] Oh Iohn, it were a long time 
to shewe the singular members with 
compounds, as Galen doth in his booke 
of the partes and bones. It requireth 
[^f.19v^] 
onely one worke, but I haue taken in 
hand to teach thee but a Gouernment 
of health: notwithstanding at thy request, 
I will briefly rehearse the number 
of the bones, no lesse true than 
newe, which is, the verie timber, or 
postes whereupon our fraile flesh is 
builded, beginning in our mothers 
wombes, and ending in earth the mother 
of all things. And as the noble 
prince Auicen affirmeth, the number 
of all the bones, be two hundred fourty 
and foure, beside Sasamina, & Os laude. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Thou hast spoken of the opening 
of veynes, and medicins conuenient 
to cleanse the bloud, with the number 
of bones, but thou hast not spoken 
of coneuenient time when to let blood, 
nor of the state or age of them whose 
veynes should be opened. Therefore I 
would be glad to learne, not onely time 
of bloud-letting, but also, of purging, 
the belly vomits, bathings, neesings, and 
rubbing of the bodie, &c. 
 
[/62./] 
[}Hum.}] Euery thing hath his time 
conuenient, and must bee done with 
sober discretion, and not with rash 
ignorance, which killeth an infinite 
[^f.20r^] 
number. Therefore the cause must be 
knowne, and the time obserued, as Galen 
writeth in the Commentarie of 
[/63./] 
the Afforismes of Hippocrates, manie 
bodies be extinguished by sudde~ death, 
in whom is extreme fulnesse, or aboundance. 
For aboundance of blood or 
any other humor sayth Aristotle, is the 
[/64./] 
cause of many sickenesses, and those 
men that vse much gluttonie in 
Winter, shall bee apt to receyue manie 
diseases in the Spring time. 
Therefore when the bodie hath extreme 
heat, fulnes of veynes, flushing, 
with sodain rednesse in the face, grosse 
and red vrine, and such burning heate 
in the night that let the sleepe, &c: then 
it is tyme to euacuate the bodie, with 
some purgation, bloud letting, or abstinence 
as the strength and age of 
the patient will serue. For manie diseases, 
be helped by discrete bloud letting, 
as Plurises, hot Feuers, Frensies, 
[/65./] 
Repletion, or Surfets taken 
with ouermuch eating or drinking, 
as Galen sayeth. The letting of bloud 
dryeth vppe the superfluous moysture 
of the bellie, helpeth memorie, 
[^f.20v^] 
purgeth the bladder, quieteth y=e= braine, 
warmeth the marrow, openeth the organs 
of hearing, helpeth digestion, induceth 
sleepe, &c. Unto this agreeth Rasis, 
[/66./] 
saying, it helpeth greatly against 
Leprosie, Squinances, Appoplexes, 
Pestilences, &c. But olde men, children, 
or women with childe, ought not 
to be let bloud, nor also those people 
that dwell in colde regions, may not be 
let bloud, because the bloud is the chief 
warmer of nature. The people that 
dwell in hot regions, if they be letten 
bloud, it will dry their bodies, for blood 
is the chiefe moister of nature. Therefore 
is the heate of Sommer, and the 
coldnesse of Winter, forbidden to open 
veynes, or let bloud, except for a stripe, 
[/67./] 
or sudden chaunce, as Rasis sayth, the 
spring of the yeare is the chiefe time 
[/68./] 
to let bloud in the right arme, or right 
foote, in the veyne called Mediana. 
Which veyne must bee opened as well 
at other times in the beginning of sicknesses, 
as hot feuers, and plurisies, &c. 
as Basilica should bee opened in the 
middle, or toward the ende of a sickenesse. 
Purgations ought to bee ministred 
[^f.21r^] 
with great discretion, and not 
rashly to be taken, for euerie trifle as 
thou hast heard me speake of bloud letting. 
So obserue the selfe same rules 
in purgation, as time, person, qualitie, 
[/69./] 
or quantitie. For Hippocrates sayeth, 
without doubt it is needfull to 
purge the superfluitie of the bodie. As 
of bloud doe abound to take things to 
purge blood. If fleugme be supefluous, 
then take things to cleanse his superfluitie. 
If choler bee too ardent hote, 
vse things to extinguish: If melancholy 
be too extreme then taste things to 
bring him into a meane. And not to 
[/70./] 
purge one humour with the medicines 
of an other, but to take them in due order 
and aptnes. For the said humors 
as Valarius Cordus. Mesue, and Nicholas, 
teach the maner of making of the 
most excellent purgations with their 
[/71./] 
quantities. And as in blood letting 
sleepe must bee auoyded for viii. or xii. 
houres after them: so when your purgations 
be taken, aire is to be auoided 
and to kept close for ii. or three daies 
or more, as the malice of the disease, or 
power of the purgations be, & the counsaile 
[^f.21v^] 
of Rasis must bee followed: which 
[/72./] 
sayth, oftentimes to take Purgations 
or laxatiue medicines doeth make the 
bodie weake, and apt to the Feuer 
ethicke, and specially in verie leane 
or weake persons, they that bee verie 
fat haue small guts and veynes, purgations 
bee verie noisome vnto them. 
But strong bodies hauing large vessels, 
may sustaine purgations without 
any hurt, but strong purgations, either 
in pils or potions, if they any thing do 
exceede be verie hurtfull: therefore the 
baces or quantities may not exceede. 
And also they must bee made as pleasant 
as Art can doe them, vnlesse they 
[/73./] 
offend the stomacke. Hippocrates giueth 
counsell that men should not mingle 
medicins with meate, but to take 
them three or foure hours before meat, 
or else so long after. Unlesse, they bee 
pils called Antecibum, which may bee 
taken at the beginning of supper, or 
else Pillichochi, a little before sleepe, 
two hours after supper. The best time 
[/74./] 
of purgations is in the spring time, as 
the doctors doth affirme: the apt dayes 
and signes are commonly knowne in 
[^f.22r^] 
the English Almanacks, calculated into 
English. As in the writings of master 
[/75./] 
Leonard Digges, and of William 
Kenningham, a learned student both in 
Astronomie and Phisicke, with manie 
mo good men that taketh paynes to 
profite the common wealth. There is 
another maner of purging of the bodie 
[/76./] 
by vomit, for it clenseth from the midriffe 
vpward, if they haue large brests, 
and be cholericke persons. It is good againt 
dropsies, & leprosies, & better in 
[/77./] 
summer than in winter, as Hippocrates 
saith: and wholsomer one houre before 
supper than at any other time, and 
not to be vsed as a custome: for the custome 
[/78./] 
of vomits hurteth greatly the 
head and eies, and maketh the stomack 
so feeble, that it will scant beare anie 
meates or drinkes, but eftsoones cast 
them vp again. They which haue narrowe 
throtes and breastes, and long 
neckes, vomits be neither apt nor good 
for them. And Auicen saith, that vomits 
[/79./] 
ought to bee twise in the Moneth 
for the conseruation of health, but 
[/80./] 
that which is more doeth hurt the bodie. 
There is another kinde of the 
[^f.22v^] 
clensing of the body by sweating, as 
with hot drinkes, warme clothes, perfumes 
made of Olibalum brimstone, 
niter, &c. There is also bathes, and 
sweating in hot houses for the pockes, 
scurffe, scabbles, hemerodes, piles, 
which hot houses haue the vertue of 
[/81./] 
helping the saide diseases. But if any 
that be of an whole temperate complexion 
do sweate in drie hot houses, 
it doth them much harme: as hyndring 
their eyesights, decaying their teeth, 
hurting memory. The best bathing is 
in a great vessel, or a litle close place 
with the euapuration of diuers sweete 
hearbes wel sodden in water, which 
haue vertue to open the poores softly, 
letting out feeble and grosse vapors, 
which lieth betwene the skinne and 
[/82./] 
the flesh. This kinde of bathing is good 
in the time of pestilence, or feuer quarten: 
in the end of the bathes, it is good 
to anoint the body with some sweete 
oyle, to molifie and make soft the 
sinewes. And thus to conclude of bathing, 
[/83./] 
it is verie holsome, so that it be 
not doone vppon an emptie stomacke, 
palsies may come thereby, or to take 
[^f.23r^] 
sodaine colde after it, there foloweth 
an other purgation, called neesing or 
sternutacion which is beneficial for the 
[/84./] 
bodie if it be vsed vpon an empty stomacke. 
Twyse or thrice in a morning 
with a leafe of Bittony, put into thy 
nose, it helpeth memory, good against 
opilation, stopping, and obstructions: 
[/85./] 
Suppositers be good for weake people 
or children, made with Hieria Picra 
[/86./] 
and hony, made in the length of a finger: 
Scarifiyng or boxing, as Galen 
saith, applied vnto the extreme partes, 
as the legges, and the armes, doth 
great helpe vnto the body, in drawing 
watery humour away from the body, 
but boxing is not good for the brest, applied 
thereto in hote feuers, is daungerous. 
Glisters made according to 
[/87./] 
arte, be good for them which be too 
weake to take purgation. The maner 
of the said glisters, because they be not 
here to be spoken of at large, I entend 
by Gods grace to set forth in my next 
[/88./] 
book of helthful medicins. Purgations 
venerous, there be so many practicioners 
thereof, that I neede to write no 
rules but this, that affection, lust and 
[^f.23v^] 
fantasie, haue banished chastitie, temperance, 
and honestie. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Plaine people in the countrie, 
as carters threshers, ditchers, colliers, 
and plowmen, vse seldome times to 
wash their hands, as appeareth by their 
filthynes, and as verie few times combe 
their heads, as it is seene by floxe, 
nittes, grease, fethers, strawe, and such 
like, which hangeth in their haires. 
Whether is washing or combing things 
to decorate or garnish the body, or else 
[/89./] 
to bring health to the same? 
 
[}Hum.}] Thou seest that the deere, 
horse, or cowe, will vse friction or rubbing 
them selues against trees both 
for their ease and health. Birdes and 
haukes, after their bathing will prune 
and rowse them selues vpon their 
[/90./] 
braunches and perkes, and all for 
health. What should man do, which is 
reasonable but to keepe himself cleane, 
and often to wash the handes, which is 
a thing most comfortable to coole the 
heate of the liuer, if it bee done often. 
the handes be also the instrumentes 
to the mouth & eies, with many other 
thinges commonly to serue the bodie. 
[^f.24r^] 
To wash the handes in cold water is 
very holsome for the stomake and lyuer, 
[/91./] 
but to wash with hot water engendreth 
rheumes, wormes and corruption, 
in the stomacke, because it 
pulleth away naturall heate vnto the 
[/92./] 
warmed place, which is washed. Frication 
or rubbing the bodie, is good to 
be done in the mornings after the purgation 
of the belly with warme clothes, 
from the head to the brest, then to the 
belly, from the belly to the thighes, 
legges, and so forth. So that it be done 
downwarde, it is good. And in drie 
[/93./] 
folkes to be rubbed with the oyle of 
camomill. Kembing of the head is good 
in mornings, and doth comfort memorie, 
it is euil at night and openeth the 
[/94./] 
pores. The cutting of the haire, and 
the paring of the nailes, cleane keepeing 
of the eares, and teeth, be not only 
thinges comely and honest, but also 
holsome rules of Phisicke for to be superfluous 
things of the excrements. 
 
[}Ioh.}] The chiefe thing that I had 
thought to haue demanded, & the very 
marke that I would haue thee to shote 
at is to tell me some thing of dieting 
[^f.24v^] 
my selfe with meate and drinke, in 
health and sickenesse. 
 
[/95./] 
[}Hum.}] There is to be considered in 
eating, the time of hunger or custome, 
the place of eating and drinking, whether 
it be colde or hote, also the time of 
the yeere, whether it bee Winter or 
Summer: also the age or complexion 
of the eater, and whether he bee whole 
or sicke: also the things which be eaten, 
whether they be fish or flesh, fruit 
or herbes. Note also the complection 
and temperaments of the said meate 
hot or colde, drie or moyst, and most 
chiefly, marke the quantitie, and so 
forth. And like as lampes doe consume 
the oyle which is put vnto them 
for the preseruation of the light, although 
it cannot continue for euer: so 
is the naturall heate which is withing 
vs preserued by humiditie and moystnesse 
of bloud and fleugme, whose chief 
engenderer be good meates & drinkes. 
As Auicen saith de ethica, When naturall 
heate is quenched in the bodie, 
then of necessitie the soule must depart 
from the bodie. For the workman 
can not worke when his instrument is 
[^f.25r^] 
gone. So the spirits of life, can haue 
[/96./] 
no exercise in the body when there is 
no naturall heate to worke vpon. 
Without meate saith Galen, it is not 
possible for any man to liue, either 
whole or sicke: and thus to conclude, 
no vital thing liueth without refection 
and sustenaunce, whether it be 
animall reasonable, or animall sensible, 
without reason or any vital thing 
insensible, both man, beast, fish, and 
worme, tree, or hearb. All these things 
be newtrified with the influence or 
substaunce of the foure Elementes or 
any of them. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Well Humfrey, thou knowest 
my complexion and disorder of my 
diet what remedy for me, that haue liued 
like a riotter? 
 
[}Hum.}] I know it well thou arte flegmatike, 
[/97./] 
and therefore it is long yer 
thy meate be disgested. When thou 
dost eate fish and flesh together, it doth 
corrupt in thy stomack and stink, euen 
so doth hard cheese and cold fruits. And 
olde poudred meates, and raw hearbes 
ingender euil humors: so the diuersity 
of quality & quantity of diuers meats, 
[^f.25v^] 
doth bring much paine to the stomack, 
& doth engender many diseases, as thou 
[/98./] 
maist reade in the first booke of Galen: 
Iuuementis membrorum. cap .iiij. And 
the Prince himselfe sayeth in 3. prim. 
[/99./] 
doct. 2. cap. 7. Saying, nothing is 
more hurtfull than diuerse meates to 
be ioyned together. For while as the 
last is receyuing, the first beginneth to 
digest. And when the table is garnished 
with diuerse meates, some rosted, 
some fried and baked, some warme, 
some colde, some fish, some flesh, with 
sundrie fruites, and sallets of diuerse 
hearbes to please thine eye, remember 
with thy self, that the sight of them 
all is better, than the feeding of 
them all. 
 
[/100./] 
Consider with thy selfe thou art a 
man and no beast, therefore bee temperate 
in thy feeding, and remember 
[/101./] 
the wise woordes of Salomon. Be 
not greedie, sayeth hee, in euerie eating, 
and bee not hastie vppon all 
meates: for excesse of meates bringeth 
sickenesse, and gluttonie commeth 
at the last into an vnmeasurable 
heate. Through surfet haue manie 
[^f.26r^] 
a one perished, but hee that dieteth 
[/102./] 
himselfe temperately, prolongeth 
his life. Therefore grosse fish, lambs 
flesh, the in-meates of beastes, rawe 
hearbes, pigges braines, and all slimie 
meates, bee euill for thee: but late 
suppers is woorst of all, and specially 
if they bee long, for it causeth painfull 
nights to follow. But Galen sayeth 
in his Booke De ethimia, the 
meates which bee without all blame, 
bee those which bee betweene subtill 
and grosse. Good bread of cleane wheat, 
flesh of capons or hennes, phesants, 
and partriches, pigeons, and turtle 
doues, blacke birdes, and small fielde 
birdes, rosted veale, or boyled mutton: 
These doe engender good bloud sayeth 
[/103./] 
Galen. Note also, that any other 
meate that thou doest eate at supper, 
although it seeme repugnant to a fleugmaticke 
stomacke, if thou sleepe well 
after it, and feele no paine, thou mayest 
vse it as a meate necessarie. And 
when thou canst not sleepe well, if the 
default came through meate, marke 
that meate or drinke, although it appeare 
pleasant, refuse it as an enemie. 
 
[^f.26v^] 
And whereas thou hast vsed euill diet 
as a custome in abusing time, quantitie 
and qualitie, by little and little 
bring thy selfe into good order, and to 
time, both for thy breakfasts, dinner, 
and supper. Prouided alway to eate 
good things, but not many things. For 
like as repletion or abundaunce of 
meate is an enemie to the bodie, and 
the soule, and bringeth sodaine death: 
euen so is emptinesse a shortner of 
[/104./] 
time, a weakner of the braine, a hinderer 
of memory, an increaser of wind, 
choler, & melancholy. And oftentimes 
to many bringeth sudden death also, 
except nature haue some thing to 
worke vpon, as I did tell thee before: 
vse some light things at breakfast of 
perfite digestion, within foure houres 
after that receiue thy dinner obseruing 
the good order of diet, drinking 
wine or beere oftentimes, and little at 
once, eschewing great draughts of 
drinke, which is vsed among beasts, 
[/105./] 
and mingle thy meate with mirth, 
which is euer the best dish, at the boord, 
and be thankefull to God. And so leaue 
with an appetite, passing y=e= time wiselie 
[^f.27r^] 
betweene dinner and supper, with 
exercise, labour, study or pastime, vnto 
the ende of sixe houres, and then begin 
thy supper, prouided that it bee shorter 
than thy dinner, eating thy meate by 
little and little: for greedie and sudden 
eating is hurtfull to nature, as Galen 
[/106./] 
sayth in his Diatorie. Note also, that 
thou maist eate more meat in Winter 
than in Summer, because thy naturall 
heate is enclosed with thy bodie in 
Winter, but vniuersally spread in 
Summer. Also cholericke men may as 
lightly digest beefe, bacon, veneson, 
&c. With as much speede and litle hurt 
as the fleugmatike man may eate, rabit 
chicken, and partridge, &c. But the 
melancholie man through the coldnesse 
[/107./] 
of the stomacke hath not that 
strength in the stomacke as hee hath 
promtpnes in wil: to eat things warm 
and moyst be good for him. The sanguine 
[/108./] 
man is not so swift in this digestion, 
as the hote cholericke man is. 
But notwithstanding, he hath good digestion 
through the humiditie and 
warmnes of bloud, and coueteth to eat 
sweete things, which greatly augment 
[^f.27v^] 
the bloud: therfore sharpe sauces made 
with vineger, onions, and barbaries 
bee wholesome. Purslen, sorrell, small 
fishes that feede vppon the stones in 
fayre running waters, cowcumbers 
and pure French wine partly delayed 
with water, bee good for the saide sanguine 
men: to keepe them from much 
encrease of flesh. 
 
[}Ioh.}] Thou hast shewed vnto me a very 
discrete and wholsome order of diet 
particular to my selfe, and partly to other 
complexions: but what rule or prety 
Gouernment is for sicke folks? 
 
[}Hum.}] They that be sodainlie vexed 
[/109./] 
with sharpe sicknesses, must haue thin 
diets, with water gruell, thin mutton 
or chicken pottage without any fat or 
thicknes, violet leaues, endiue leaues, 
and such like cooling hearbes, and let 
their drinkes be made of Tezantes, 
thus doe to them that haue hot sharpe 
sickenesses, occasioned of choler. And 
also colde siroppes of endiue, violets, 
sugar, water, and vinegar, sodden together 
bee verie wholesome. But if 
sickenesses bee long of continuance, 
their diet must bee the thicker, and 
[^f.28r^] 
their meates made the stronger: specially 
if their diseases be cold: with the 
flesh of cocks, capons, temperate wine, 
stewed broath, with wholsome hearbs, 
as buglos, borrage, basill, parcely, and 
finkle rootes, with some maces, 
dates, damaske prunes, reisins of the 
sunne, and such like. Sirops of Isope 
[/110./] 
and citeron, prouided that they neyther 
take meate nor medicine immediately 
before, or soone after their fittes: 
posset ale with clarified hearbes, excepted, 
which they may take, for their 
comfort, according to the estate of their 
disease, for such as be sicke must haue 
meate, contrarie to their complexion. 
For they that be colde, must haue hote 
meate, and medicines. And they that 
be drie, must haue moyst thinges. 
But they that bee hote must haue colde 
thinges, for the ardent heate of the fire 
is quenched with the moystnesse of 
the water, and so the quantitie of one 
qualitie, ouercommeth the qualitie 
of an other. And in deede, Phisicke 
sayeth, the bodies that bee hote, must 
be fed with things like, as they that be 
moist, with moyst things to preserue 
[^f.28v^] 
their moistnes. They that be hote, 
with hot things to preserue their heate 
and such like. But when they doe exceede 
in heate, cold, moist or drie, then 
let the qualities of moistnes, be tempered 
[/111./] 
with drienes, and the coldnes 
with warmnes. For like as man delighteth 
in things of like, as the cholericke 
man, cholericke things, euen so 
do beasts, and fruites, as the Colloquintida, 
which is bitter, delighteth in 
bitter ground. Hote spices delight to 
grow in hot ground, and euery fruit 
and hearbe doth delite in the thing 
that is of like: euen so doth man in his 
foode. But in al things let him beware 
of distemperaunce, surfites or repletion 
reare suppers and drunkennesse. 
 
[}Ioh.}] But if a man feele great griefe 
after meates or drinkes, what way is 
there then for to helpe him? 
 
[}Hum.}] Use walking vp and down, 
[/112./] 
and perhappes that will disgeste, as 
Auicen saieth: And Rasis sayeth, to 
[/113./] 
walke a hundreth paces after meate, 
is holsome, for it comforteth disgestion 
prouoketh vryne, and giueth one power 
and strength of stomacke to eate 
[^f.29r^] 
his supper. But the counsaile of Galen 
[/114./] 
must here be obserued. Which saieth: 
there is no meate but it will corrupt 
or stinke, if the bodie be cast into a sodain 
heate, by strong trauel soone after 
meate, which corruption of disgestion 
is the mother of all diseases, and the 
[/115./] 
beginner of all infirmities, as Auicen 
reporteth: And if you see this will not 
helpe to disgest your ingorged full stomake, 
then prouoke your selfe to 
sleepe lying vppon your right side, leaning 
toward your breast and belly, 
laying your warme hand vpon your 
breast, as Auerois saith: the power of 
[/116./] 
disgestion is made strong when a man 
sleepeth. For naturall heat that is drawen 
inwardly with warmnes, or heat 
hath power to digest. But if sleepe ease 
you not, prouoke vomit or fast it out, 
and this is the counsell of many learned 
men. For it is no meruaile although 
many meates corrupt one 
man, which be of sundrie and diuers 
workinges in the stomake, liuer and 
[/117./] 
veine, for the qualities doe hinder 
nature as much as the quantities. And 
take heed, these signes and euill tokens 
[^f.29v^] 
be not found in youth. The paines of 
all your members with idlenes and 
wearines, to go or moue your bodie. 
Sodayne great blushing or rednesse 
in your face, veines swelled and puffed 
vp, red bryne, and grosse skinne, exte~ded 
or stretched out with fulnes, like 
a blowen bladder and ful pulses, small 
desire to meat, il rest & griefe in sleepe, 
seeming in sleep to beare some intollerable 
burden, or dreaming to be speechlesse: 
these be the euill & dangerous tokens 
of replection. And of this I giue 
you warning, for it hath slaine as 
manie by aboundance, as hunger hath 
killed through scarcitie.
