[}The .vij. Chapytre doth shewe howe 
the hed of a howse, or a howseholder 
shulde exercyse hym selfe, for the 
helth of the soule & body.}] 
 
AFter that a man 
hath prouyded all thynges 
necessary for his howse and 
for his howseholde, expedyent 
it is for hym to knowe, 
howe he shuld exercyse hym 
selfe both bodely and ghostly. For there is no 
catholycke or chrysten man lyuyng, but he is 
bounde in conscyence to be more circu~specter 
aboute the welth of his soule then the helth of 
his body. Our sauyour Iesus Chryst sayth, 
what shall it profyte vnto man yf he geat all 
the worlde, and lese hym selfe, and bryng hym 
[^f.D1v^] 
selfe to a detryme~t, wherfore it appereth that 
a man ought to be circumspecte for the helth 
and welth of his soule. For he is bounde so to 
lyue, that nyght and day and at all houres he 
shulde be redy, than whan he is called for to 
departe out of this worlde, he shuld nat feare 
to dye, saying these wordes with saynt Ambrose. 
I feare not to dye, bycause we haue a 
good god, whan a man hath prepared for his 
soule, and hath subdued sensualyte, and that 
he hath brought hym selfe in a trade, or a vsage 
of a ghostly or a catholycke lyuynge in obseruyng 
the co~maundementes of God, than 
he must study to rule and to gouern them the 
whiche be in his howseholde, or vnder his custody 
or domynyon, to se y~ they be not ydle, 
for kynge Henry the eyght sayd when he was 
yong, ydlenes is chefe maistres of vyces all. 
And also the heade of a howse must ouer se 
that they the which be vnder his tuyssyon serue 
god the holy dayes as dylygently, yee and 
more dylygentler than to do theyr worke the 
feryall dayes, refraynynge them from vyce 
and synne, compellynge them to obserue the 
co~maundementes of God, specyally to punysshe 
swearers, for in all the worlde there is 
not suche odyble swearyng as is vsed in Englande, 
[^f.D2r^] 
specyally amonge youth & chyldren, 
which is a detestable thyng to here it, and no 
man doth go aboute to punysshe it. Suche 
thynges reformed than may an howseholder 
be glad not cessynge to instruct them the whiche 
be ygnorant, but also he must contynewe 
in shewynge good example of lyuynge, than 
may he reioyse in God and be mery, the whiche 
myrth & reioysyng doth lengthen a mans 
lyfe, and doth expell syckenes. 
 
[}The .viij. Chapytre doth shew howe 
a man shulde ordre hym selfe in slepynge 
and watchynge, and 
in weryng his apparell.}] 
 
WHan a man hath 
exercysed hym selfe in the 
daye tyme as is rehersed, 
he may slepe soundly and 
surely in god what chaunce 
so euer do fortune in the 
nyght. Moderate slepe is moste praysed for 
it doth make parfyte degestyon, it doth nourysshe 
the blode, and doth qualyfye the heate 
of the lyuer, it doth acuate, quycken, & refressheth 
the memory, it doth restore nature, and 
[^f.D2v^] 
doth quyet all the humours & pulses in man, 
and doth anymate, and doth comforte all the 
naturall and anymall and spyrytyall powers 
of man. And such moderate slepe is acceptable 
in the syght of God the premysses in the 
aforesayd Chapytre obserued and kept. And 
contraryly i~moderate slepe and sluggyshnes 
doth humecte and maketh lyghte the brayne, it 
doth ingendre rewme and impostumes, it is 
euyll for the palsy whyther it be vnyuersall or 
partyculer, it is euyll for y~ fallynge syckenes 
called Epilencia, Analencia, & Cathalencia, 
Appoplesia, Soda, with all other infyrmytyes 
in the heade, for it induceth and causeth 
oblyuyousnes, for it doth obfuske and doth 
obnebulate the memorye and the quyckenes 
of wyt. And shortly to conclude it doth perturbe 
the naturall, and anymall, and spyrytuall 
powers of man. And specyally it doth 
instygate and lede a man to synne, and doth 
induce and infer breuyte of lyfe, & detestably 
it displeaseth God. Our lorde Iesu Chryste 
dyd not onely byd or co~mau~de his dyscyples 
to watche, but dyd anymat them and al other 
so to do saying. I say not onely to you watche, 
but to all men I say watche. And to Peter 
he said, myghtest not thou one houre watche 
[^f.D3r^] 
with me, althoughe these holy scryptures 
with many other mo the whiche I myght allygate 
for me, althoughe they be not greatly referred 
to this se~ce, yet it may stande here with 
my purpose & matter without reprehensyon. 
These matters here nede not to be rehersed, 
wherfore I do returne to my purpose, and 
do say that the moderacyon of slepe shulde be 
mesured accordyng to the natural co~plexyon 
of man, and in any wyse to haue a respect to 
the strength and the debylyte to age & youth, 
and to syckenes & helth of man. Fyrste as 
concernynge y~ naturall complexyon of man, 
as sanguyne and colorycke men .vii. houres 
is suffycyent for them. And nowe consyderynge 
the imbecyllyte and wekenes of nature 
a flemytycke man may slepe .ix. houres or more. 
Melancoly men may take theyr pleasure, 
for they be receptacle and the dragges of all 
the other humoures. Secondaryly youth 
and age wolde haue temporau~ce in slepynge. 
Thyrdly, strength maye suffre a brount in 
watche, the whiche debylytye and wekenes can 
not. As I wyl shew by a famylyer example. 
There were two men set at the dyce togither 
a day and a nyght & more, the weke man said 
to hym I can playe no longer. The stronge 
[^f.D3v^] 
man sayde to hym fye on the benche whystler 
wylt thou sterte away nowe. The weke man 
to satysfye the stronge mannes mynde, appyted, 
& desyre playeth with hys felow throughe 
y~ which he doth kyl hym selfe. The stronge 
man doth hym selfe lytel pleasure all thynges 
consydered, the whiche I do passe ouer, 
wherfore I wyll retourne to the sycke man, 
whiche maye slepe at all tymes whan that he 
maye get it, but yf he maye slepe at any tyme 
best it is for hym to refrayn from slepe in the 
day, & to take his naturall rest at nyght whan 
all thynges is or shulde be at rest and peace, 
but he must do as his infyrmyte wyll permyt 
and suffre. whole men of what age or complexyon 
soeuer they be of shuld take theyr natural 
rest and slepe in the nyght, & to exchew 
merydyall slepe. But an nede shall compell a 
man to slepe after his meate, let hym make a 
pause, and than let hym stand and leane and 
slepe agaynst a cupborde, or els let hym sytte 
vp ryght in a chayre & slepe. Slepynge after 
a full stomacke doth ingendre dyuerse infyrmyties, 
it doth hurte the splen, it relaxeth the 
synewes, it doth ingendre the dropsyes and 
the gowte, and doth make a man loke euyll coloured. 
Beware of Veneryous actes before 
[^f.D4r^] 
the fyrste slepe, and specyally beware of such 
thynges after dyner or after a full stomacke, 
for it doth ingendre the crampe, the gowte, 
and other displeasures. To bedwarde be you 
mery, or haue mery company aboute you, so 
that to bedwarde no anger nor heuynes, sorowe 
nor pencyfulnes do trouble or disquyet 
you. To bedwarde, and also in the mornyng 
vse to haue a fyre i~ your chambre to wast and 
consume the euyll vapours within the chambre, 
for the breath of man maye putryfye the 
ayre within the chambre. I do aduertyse you 
not to stande nor to syt by the fyre, but stand 
or syt a good waye of from the fyre takynge 
the flauour of it, for fyre doth aryfye & doth 
drye vp a ma~nes blode, and doth make sterke 
the synewes & ioyntes of man. In the nyght 
let the wyndowes of your howse, specially of 
your chambre be closed, whan you be in your 
bed lye a lytel whyle on your left syde, & slepe 
on your ryght syde. And whan you do wake 
of your fyrste slepe make water yf you fele 
your bladder charged, and than slepe on the 
lefte syde, and loke as ofte as you do wake so 
oft tourne yourselfe in the bed from the one 
syde to the other. To slepe grouelynge vpon 
the stomacke and belly is not good, oneles 
[^f.D4v^] 
the stomacke be slow and tarde of digestyon, 
but better it is to lay your hande or your bedfelowes 
hande ouer your stomacke, than to 
lye grouelyng. To slepe on y~ backe vpryght 
is vtterly to be abhorred, when y~ you do slepe 
let not your necke nother your shoulders, nother 
your handes nor fete, nor no other place 
of your body lye bare vndyscouered. Slepe 
not with an empty stomacke, nor slepe not after 
that you haue eaten meate one houre or 
two after. In your beed lye with your heed 
somwhat hygh, lest that the meate which is in 
your stomacke thorow eructuacyons or some 
other cause ascend to y~ gryfe of the stomacke. 
Let your nyght cap be of skarlet, & this I do 
aduertyse you for to cause to be made a good 
thycke quylt of cotton, or els of pure flockes 
or of clene woull, and let the couerynge of it 
be of whyte fustyan, and laye it on the fether 
beed that you do lye on, and in your beed lye 
not to hote nor to colde, but in a temporaunce. 
Olde auncyent doctours of Physycke sayth. 
viii. houres of slepe in So~mer & .ix. houres of 
slepe in wynter is suffycyent for any man, 
but I do thynke that slepe ought to be taken 
as the complexyon of man is, whan you do 
ryse in the morenynge, ryse with myrth and 
[^f.E1r^] 
remembre God. Let your hosen be brusshed 
within and without, and flauour the insyde 
of them agaynst the fyre, vse lynen sockes or 
lynnen hosen next your legges, whan you be 
out of your bedde stretche forth your legges 
and armes and your body, coughe and spyt 
and than go to your stole to make your egestyon, 
and exonerate your selfe at all tymes 
that nature wold expell. For yf you do make 
any restryction in kepynge your egestion or 
your vryne or ventosyte, it maye put you to 
dyspleasure in bredyng dyuers infyrmyties. 
After you haue euacuated your body, & trussed 
your poyntes, kayme your heade oft, and 
so do dyuerse tymes in the daye. And wasshe 
your handes and wrestes, your face and eyes 
and your tethe with colde water, & after that 
you be apparelled walke in your gardayne or 
parke a thousande pace or two, & than great 
and noble men doth vse to here masse, & other 
men that can not do so, but must applye theyr 
busynes, doth serue God with some prayers, 
surrendrynge thankes to hym for his many 
folde goodnes, with askyng mercye for theyr 
offences, & before you go to your refection 
moderatly exercyse your body with some labour 
or playing at the tennys, or castyng a 
[^f.E1v^] 
bowle, or paysyng wayghtes or plomettes of 
ledde in your handes or some other thynge to 
open your poores, and to augment naturall 
hete. At dyner & supper vse not to drynke of 
sondry drynkes, & eate not of dyuers meates 
but fede of two or thre dysshes at the moste. 
After that you haue dyned & supped laboure 
not by and by after, but make a pause syttynge 
or standyng vpright the space of an houre 
or more with some pastyme, drynke not moch 
after dyner. At your supper vse light meates 
of digestyon, & refrayne from grose meates, 
go not vnto bedde with a ful nor emptye stomacke. 
And after your supper make a pause 
or you go to bedde, and go to bed as I sayde, 
with myrth. Furthermore, as co~cernynge your 
apparell in wynter nexte your sherte vse to 
were a petycote of skarlet, your doublet vse at 
plesure, but I do aduertyse you to lyne your 
Iacket vnder this fasshyon or maner, by you 
fyne skynnes of whyte lambe & blacke lambe, 
and let your skynner cut both the sort~ of the 
skynnes in smale peces tryangle wyse, lyke 
halfe a quarel of a glase wyndow. And than 
sewe togyther a whyte pece and a blacke lyke 
a hole quarell of a glasse wyndowe, & so sewe 
vp togyther quarell-wyse as moche as wyll 
[^f.E2r^] 
lyne your Iacket, this fur for holsomnes is 
praysed aboue sables or any other furre, your 
exteryall apparell vse accordynge to your honour. 
In so~mer vse to were a skarlet petycote 
made of stamele or lynsye wolsye. In wynter 
and so~mer kepe nor your hed to hote nor bynde 
it to strayte, kepe euer youre necke warme. 
In so~mer kepe your necke and face from the 
so~ne, vse to were gloues made of goote skynnes 
perfumed with amber degrece. And beware 
in standynge or lying on the grownde 
in the reflyxyon of the so~ne, but be mouable. 
If you shall co~mon or talke with any man, 
stande not styll in one place yf it be on the 
bare grownde, or grasse, or stones, but be moueable 
in such places, stande nor syt vpon no 
stone nor stones, stand nor syt long bareheed 
vnder a vawte of stone. Also beware that you 
do not lye in olde chambres whiche be not occupyed, 
specyally such chambres as myse, rattes, 
and snayles resorteth vnto, lye not in suche 
chambres the whiche be depryued clene 
from the so~ne & open ayre, nor lye in no lowe 
chamber except it be borded. Beware that you 
take no colde on your feete and legges, and 
of all wether beware that you do not ryde nor 
go in great and impyteous wyndes. 
 
[^f.E2v^] 
[}The .ix. Chapytre doth shewe that 
replecyon or surfetynge doth moche 
harme to nature/ and that abstynence 
is the chefyst medyson 
of all medysons.}] 
 
GAlen declaryng Hypocrates 
sentence vpon eatynge 
to moche meate saith. More 
meate than accordeth with nature 
is named replecyon, or a surfete. Replecyon 
or a surfet is taken as well by gurgytacyons 
or to moche drynkynge, as it is taken 
by epulacyon of eatynge of crude meate, or 
eatynge more meate than doth suffyce or can 
be truely dygested. Or els replecyon or a surfyt 
is whan the stomacke is farced or stuft, or 
repleted with to moche drynke & meate, that 
the lyuer whiche is the fyre vnder the potte is 
subpressed that he can not naturally nor truely 
decoct, defye, ne dygest, the superabundau~ce 
of meate & drynke the which is in the potte 
or stomacke, wherfore dyuers tymes these impedymentes 
doth folowe, the tou~ge is depryued 
of his offyce to speke, the wyttes or sensys 
be dull & obnebulated fro~ reason. Slouth 
[^f.E3r^] 
and sluggyshnes consequently foloweth, the 
appetyde is withdrawen. The heade is lyght 
and doth ake, and full of fantasyes, & dyuers 
tymes some be so sopytyd, y~ the malt worme 
playeth the deuyll so fast in the heade, that all 
the worlde ro~neth rownde aboute on wheles, 
then both the pryncepall membres & the offycyall 
membres doth fayle of theyr strength, 
yet the pulsys be full of agylyte. Such replecyon 
specyally suche gurgytacyons doth ingender 
dyuers infyrmytes thorowe the whiche 
breuite and shortnes of lyfe doth folowe. 
For the wyse man sayth, that surfetes do kyll 
many men, and temporaunce doth prolonge 
the lyfe. And also it is wrytten Eccle. xxxvii. 
That there doth dye many mo by surfette, 
than there doth by the sworde, for as I sayde 
surfetyng ingendreth many infyrmytes, as 
the Idropyses, the gowt~, lepored, sausfleme 
& pymples in the face, veheme~t impressyons, 
vndygest humours, opylacyons, feuers, and 
putryfaccyons. And also it doth perturbate 
the heade, the eyes, the tounge, and the stomacke, 
with many other infyrmyties. For as 
Galen sayth, ouer moche replecyon or surfeting, 
causeth strangulacion and soden death, 
for as I sayde, the stomacke is so inferced, 
[^f.E3v^] 
and the lyuer is so sore obpressed that naturall 
heate and the poores be extyncted, wherfore 
abstynence for this matter is the moste 
best and the parfytest medysone that can be. 
And in no wyse eate no meate vnto y~ tyme 
the stomacke be euacuated of all yll humours 
by vomet or other conuenyent wayes, for els 
crude and rawe humours vndygested wyll 
multiply in the body to y~ detryment of man. 
Two meales a daye is suffycyent for a rest 
man, and a labourer maye eate thre tymes a 
day, & he that doth eate ofter lyueth a beestly 
lyfe. And he that doth eate more than ones in 
a day, I aduertyse hym that the fyrste refeccyon 
or meale be dygested or that he do eate 
the seconde refeccyon or meale. For there is 
nothynge more hurtfull for mans body than 
to eate meate vpon meate vndygested. For 
the last refeccyon or meale wyll let the dygestyon 
of the fyrste refeccyon or meale. Also 
sondry meates of dyuers operacyons eaten 
at one refeccion or meale, is not laudable, nor 
it is not good to syt longe at dyner and supper. 
An houre is suffycyent to syt at dyner, 
and not so longe at supper. Englande hath 
an euyll vse in syttynge longe at dyner and 
at supper. And Englysshe men hath an euyll 
[^f.E4r^] 
vse, for at the begynnynge at dyner and supper 
he wyll fede on grose meates. And y~ best 
meates which be holsome and nutratyue and 
lyeth of dygestion is kept for seruauntes, for 
whan the good meate doth come to the table 
thorowe fedyng vpon grose meate, the appetyde 
is extynct whan y~ good meet doth come 
to the table, but ma~nes mynde is so auydous 
althoughe he haue eate ynoughe whan he seth 
better meate come before hym agaynst his appetyde 
he wyll eate, wherupon doth come replecyon 
and surfetes. 
 
[}The .x. Chapytre treateth of al maner 
of drynkes, as of water, of wyne, 
of ale, of bere, of cyder, of meade, 
of metheglyn, and of whay.}] 
 
WAter is one of 
the foure Elements~, of 
the whiche dyuers lycours 
or drynkes for 
ma~nes sustynaunce be 
made of, takyng theyr 
orygynall and substaunce of it, as ale, bere, 
meade, and metheglyn. water is not holsome, 
sole by it selfe for an englysshe man, consyderynge 
[^f.E4v^] 
the contrarye vsage, whiche is not concurraunt 
with nature, water is colde, slowe, 
and slacke of dygestyon. The best water is 
rayne water so be it that it be clene and purely 
taken. Nexte to it is ro~nyng water, the whiche 
doth swyftly ro~ne from the Eest in to the 
west vpon stones or pybles. The thyrde water 
to be praysed is ryuer or broke water, the 
which is clere ro~nyng on pibles and grauayl. 
Standynge waters the whiche be refresshed 
with a fresshe spryng is co~mendable, but standyng 
waters, and well waters, to the whiche 
the sonne hath no reflyxyon, althoughe they be 
lyghter than other ro~nyng waters be, yet they 
be not so co~mendable. And let euery man be 
ware of all waters the whiche be standynge, 
and be putryfyed with froth, duckemet, and 
mudde, for yf they bake, or brewe, or dresse 
meate with it, it shall ingender many infyrmytes. 
The water y~ which euery man ought 
to dresse his meate with all, or shall vse bakynge, 
or bruyng, let it be ro~nyng, and put it in 
vessels y~ it may stande there .ii. or .iii. houres 
or it be occupyed, than strayne the vpper parte 
thoroughe a thycke lynnyn cloth, and cast 
the inferyall parte awaye. If any man do vse 
to drynke water with wyne, let it be purely 
[^f.F1r^] 
strayned, and than seth it, and after it be cold 
let hym put it to his wyne, but better it is to 
drynke with wyne stylled waters, specyally 
the water of strawberes or y~ water of buglos 
or the water of endyue, or y~ water of cycory, 
or the waters of southystell, and dau~delyon. 
And yf any man be combred with the stone 
or doth burne in the pudibnude places, vse to 
drynke with whyte wyne the water of hawes, 
and the water of mylke, loke for this matter 
in a boke of my makynge named the breuyary 
of health. 
 
 [}Of wyne.}] 
 
All maner of wynes be made of grapes, 
excepte respyse the whiche is made of a bery. 
Chose your wyne after this sorte, it must be 
fyne, fayre, & clere to the eye, it must be fragraunt 
and redolent hauynge a good odour 
and flauour in the nose, it must spryncle in 
the cup whan it is drawne or put out of the 
pot in to the cup, it must be colde & pleasaunt 
in the mouth, and it must be strong and subtyll 
of substaunce: And than moderatly dronken 
it doth acuate and doth quycken a mans 
wyttes, it doth co~fort the hert, it doth scowre 
the lyuer, specyally yf it be whyte wyn it doth 
reioyce all the powers of man, and doth nowrysshe 
[^f.F1v^] 
them, it doth ingender good blode, it 
doth comforte and doth nourysshe the brayne 
and all the body, and it resolueth fleume, it 
ingendreth heate, and it is good agaynst heuynes 
and pencyfulnes, it is ful of agylyte, 
wherfore it is medsonable, specyally whyte 
wyne, for it doth mundyfye and clense wou~des 
& sores. Furthermore the better the wyne 
is, the better humours it doth inge~der, wyne 
must not be to newe nor to olde, but hyghe 
wynes as malmyse maye be kepe longe. And 
bycause wyne is full of fumosyte, it is good 
therfore to alaye it with water. wynes hyghe 
and hote of operacyo~ doth comfort olde men 
and women, but there is no wyne good for 
chyldren & maydens, for in hyghe Almayne, 
there is no mayde shall drynke no wyne, but 
styl she shal drynke water vnto she be maried, 
the vsuall drynke, there & in other hyghe countres 
for youth is fountayn water, for in euery 
towne is a fountayne or a shalowe wel, to 
the which all people that be yonge and seruau~t~, 
hath a confluence and a recourse to drynke. 
Meane wynes as wynes of Gascony, frenche 
wynes, & specyally raynysshe wyne that 
is fyned is good with meate, specyally claret 
wyne. It is not good to drynke nother wyne 
[^f.F2r^] 
nor ale before a man doth eate somwhat, althoughe 
there be olde fantastycall saying~ to 
the contrarye. Also these hote wynes as malmesye, 
wyne course, wyne greke, romanysk, 
romny, secke, alygaunt, basterde, tyre, osay, 
Muscadell, caprycke, tynt, roberdany, with 
other hote wynes, be not good to drynke with 
meate, but after meate, & with oysters, with 
saledes, with fruyte a draught or two may be 
suffered. Olde men maye drynke as I sayde 
hyghe wynes at theyr pleasure. Furthermore 
all swete wynes and grose wynes doth make 
a man fatte. 
 
[}Of ale.}] 
 
Ale is made of malte and water, and they 
the which do put any other thynge to ale then 
is rehersed, except yest, barme, or godesgood, 
doth sofystical theyr ale. Ale for an englysshe 
man is a naturall drynke. Ale must haue these 
propertyes, it must be fresshe and cleare, it 
muste not be ropy nor smoky, nor it must haue 
no weft nor tayle. Ale shuld not be dronke 
vnder .v. dayes olde. Newe ale is vnholsome 
for all men. And sowre ale and deade ale the 
which doth stande a tylt is good for no man. 
Barly malte maketh better ale the~ oten malte 
or any other corne doth, it doth ingendre 
[^f.F2v^] 
grose humoures, but yette it maketh a man 
stronge. 
 
[}Of bere.}] 
 
Bere is made of malte, of hoppes, and water, 
it is a naturall drynke for a dutche man. 
And nowe of late dayes it is moche vsed in 
Englande to the detryment of many englysshe 
men, specyally it kylleth them the which be 
troubled with the colycke, and the stone & the 
strangulion, for the drynke is a colde drynke: 
yet it doth make a man fat, and doth inflate 
the bely, as it doth appere by the dutche mens 
faces & belyes. If the bere be well serued and 
be fyned & not newi, t doth qualyfy y~ heat of 
the lyuer. 
 
[}Of cyder.}] 
 
Cyder is made of the iuce of peeres, or of 
the iuce of aples, & other whyle cyder is made 
of both, but the best cyder is made of cleane 
peeres, the which be dulcet, but the beest is not 
praysed in physycke, for cyder is colde of operacyon, 
and is full of ventosyte, wherfore it 
doth ingendre euyll humours, and doth swage 
to moche the naturall heate of man, & doth 
let dygestyon, and doth hurte the stomacke, 
but they the which be vsed to it, yf it be dronken 
in haruyst it doth lytell harme. 
 
[}Of meade.}] 
 
[^f.F3r^] 
Meade is made of ho~ny and water boyled 
both togyther, yf it be fyned and pure it preserueth 
helth, but it is not good for them the 
whiche haue the Ilyacke or the colycke. 
 
[}Of metheglyn.}] 
 
Metheglyn is made of ho~ny & water, and 
herbes, boyled and sodden togyther, yf it be 
fyned and stale, it is better in the regyment 
of helth than meade. 
 
[}Of whay.}] 
 
whay yf it be wel ordered, specyally that 
whay the which doth come of butter, is a temporate 
drynke and is moyst, and it doth nourysshe, 
it doth clense the brest, and doth purge 
redde colour, and good for sausfleme faces. 
 
[}Of poset ale.}] 
 
Poset ale is made with hote mylke & colde 
ale, it is a temporate drynke, and is good for 
a hote lyuer, and for hote feuers, specyally yf 
colde herbes be soden in it. 
 
[}Of coyte.}] 
 
Coyte is a drynke made of water, in the 
which is layde a sowre and a salt leuyn .iii. or 
.iiii. houres, the~ it is dronke, it is a vsual drynke 
in Pycardy, in Flaundres, in Holande, in 
Brabant, and Selande. 
 
To speake of a ptysan, or of oxymel, or of 
[^f.F3v^] 
aqua vite, or of Ipocras, I do passe ouer at 
this tyme, for I do make me~syon of it in the 
Breuyary of health. 
 
[}The .xi. Chapytre treateth 
of breade.}] 
 
AVycen sayth, that 
breed made of whete maketh 
a man fatte, specyally when 
the breade is made of newe 
whete, and it doth set a man 
in temporau~ce. Breade made of fyne flower 
without leuyn is slowe of dygestyon, but it 
doth nourysshe moche yf it be truely ordered 
and well baken, whan the breade is leuened it 
is soone dygested as some olde Aucthours 
sayth, but these dayes is proued the contrary 
by the stomacke of men, for leuyn is heuy and 
ponderous. Breade hauynge to moche brande 
in it is not laudable. In Rome and other 
hyghe countres theyr loues of breade be lytell 
bygger then a walnot, and many lytell loues 
be ioyned togyther, the whiche doth serue for 
great men, and it is safferonde, I prayse it 
not. I do loue manchet breade, and great loues 
the whiche be well mowlded and thorowe 
[^f.F4r^] 
baken, y~ brande abstracted and abiected, and 
that is good for all ages. Mestlyng breade is 
made halfe of whete and halfe of Rye. And 
there is also mestlyng made halfe of rye and 
halfe of barly. And yll people wyll put whete 
and barly togyther, breade made of these aforesayde 
grayne or cornes, thus poched togyther 
maye fyll the gutte, but it shall neuer do 
good to man, no more than horse breade or 
breade made of beanes and peason shall do, 
howbeit this matter doth go moche by y~ educacyon 
or the bryngyng vp of the people, the 
which haue ben nourisshed or nutryfyde with 
suche breade. I do speake nowe in barlyes or 
maltes parte to be eaten and also dronken, 
I suppose it is to moche for one grayne, for 
barly doth ingender colde humours, and peason 
and beanes, and the substaunce co~mynge 
from theym repletyth a man with ventosyte, 
but and yf a man haue a lust or a sensuall appetyd 
to eate and drynke of a grayne bysyde 
malte or barlye, let hym eate and drynke of it 
the whiche maye be made of otes. For hauer 
cakes in scotlande is many a good lorde and 
lordes dysshe. And yf it wyll make good hauer 
cakes consequently it wyll do make good 
drynke or euyl, euery thyng as it is handled. 
[^f.F4v^] 
For it is a co~mon prouerbe, God may sende 
a man good meate, but the deuyll may sende 
an euyll coke to dystrue it, wherfore gentyll 
bakers sophystycate not your breade made of 
pure whete, yf you do where euyl ale brewers 
and ale wyues for theyr euyl brewyng & euyl 
measure, shuld clacke and ryng theyr tankardes 
at dym myls dale, I wold you shuld shake 
out the remnaunt of your sackes standynge 
in the te~mes vp to the harde chynne and. 
iii. ynches aboue, that whan you do come out 
of the water you myght shake your eares as a 
spanyell that veryly co~meth out of the water. 
Gentyll bakers make good breade, for good 
breade doth comforte, confyrme, and doth stablysshe 
a ma~nes herte, besyde the propertyes 
rehersed. Hote breade is vnholsome for any 
man, for it doth lye in y~ stomacke lyke a sponge 
baustyng vndecoct humours, yet the smel 
of newe breade is co~fortable to the heade and 
to the herte. Soden breade, as symnels and 
crackenels, and breade baken vpon a stone, or 
vpon yron, and breade that saffron is in, is 
not laudable. Burnt breade, and harde crust~, 
& pasty crustes, doth ingendre color, aduste, 
and melancoly humours, wherfore chyp the 
vpper crust of your breade. And who so doth 
[^f.G1r^] 
vse to eate y~ seconde crust after meate, it maketh 
a man leane. And so doth wheten breade 
the which is ful of brande. Breade the whiche 
is nutrytyue & praysed in physycke shuld 
haue these propertes. Fyrste it must be newe, 
but a daye & a nyght olde, nor it is not good 
whan it is past .iiii. or .v. dayes olde, except the 
loues be great, nor it must not be moldy nor 
musty, it must be well muldyd, it must be thorowe 
bake, it muste be lyght & not heuye, and 
it must be temporatly salted. Olde breade or 
stale breade doth dry vp the blod, or naturall 
moyster of man, & it doth ingender 
euyll humours, and is euyll and tarde 
of dygestyon, wherfore there is no 
surfet so euyll as the surfet 
of eatynge of 
euyll breade. 
 
[}The .xij. Chapyter treateth of potage, 
of sewe, of stewpottes, of grewell, 
of fyrme~te, of pease potage, of almon 
mylke, of ryce potage, of 
cawdels, of culleses, and of 
other brothes.}] 
 
[^f.G1v^] 
AL maner of lyquyd 
thynges as potage, 
sewe, & all other 
brothes doth replete a 
man that eateth theym 
with ve~tosyte. Potage 
is not so moch vsed in 
all crystendom as it is 
vsed in Englande. Potage is made of the lyquor 
in the which flesshe is soden in, with puttyng 
to chopped herbes, and otemel and salt. 
The herbes with the whiche potage is made 
with all, yf they be pure, good, and clene, not 
warme eaten, nor infected with the corrupt 
ayre descendynge vpon them, doth comforte 
many men, the ventosyte notwithstandyng. 
But for asmoch as dyuers tymes, many partes 
of Englande is infected with the pestylence, 
thorow the corrupcyon of the ayre, the 
which doth infecte the herbes, In such tymes 
it is not good to make any potage, nor to 
eate no potage. In certayn placs beyonde see 
where as I haue traueyled in, in the pestylence 
tyme a general co~maundment hath ben 
sent from the superyoryte to the co~monalte, 
that no man shuld eate herbes in suche infeccyous 
tymes. 
 
[^f.G2r^] 
[}Of sewe and stewpottes.}] 
 
Sewe and stewpottes, and grewell made 
with otmell, in all the which no herbes be put 
in, can do lytel displeasure, except that it doth 
replete a man with ventosyte, but it relaxeth 
the belly. 
 
[}Of fyrmente.}] 
 
Fyrmente is made of whete and mylke, in 
the whiche yf flesshe be soden, to eate it is not 
co~mendable, for it is harde of dygestyon, but 
whan it is dygested it doth nourysshe, and it 
doth strength a man. 
 
[}Of pease potage & beane potage.}] 
 
Pease potage and beane potage doth replete 
a man with ventosyte. Pease potage is 
better than beane potage, for it is sooner dygested, 
& lesser of ventosyte, they both be abstercyue, 
and do clense the body. They be co~pytent 
of nutryment, but beane potage doth 
increase grosse humours. 
 
[}Of almon mylke & of ryce potage.}] 
 
Almon mylke and ryce potage, Almons 
be hote and moyste, it doth comforte the brest 
and it doth mollyfye the bely, and prouoketh 
vryne. Ryce potage made with almon mylke 
doth restore and doth comforte nature. 
 
 [}Of ale-brues, caudelles, & colesses.}] 
 
[^f.G2v^] 
Ale brues, caudelles, and colesses for weke 
men and feble stomackes, the whiche can not 
eate solydate meate is suffered. But caudels 
made with hempe sede, and collesses made of 
shrympes doth comforte blode and nature. 
 
[}Of ho~ny soppes and other brothes.}] 
 
Ho~ny soppes & other brothes of what kynde 
or substaunce soeuer they be made of, they 
doth ingender ventosyte, wherfore they be 
not good nor holsome for the colycke nor the 
Illycke, nor other inflatyue impedymentes 
or syckenesses, specyally yf ho~ny be in it, the 
sayinges of Plyne, Galene, Auycene, with 
other Aucthours notwithstandynge, for in 
these dayes experyence teacheth vs contrary 
to theyr sayinges & wrytyng~, for althoughe 
the nature of man be not altered, yet it is weker, 
and nothynge so stronge nowe as when 
they lyued. &c. 
 
[}The . xiij. Chapitre treateth of whyt 
meate, as of egges, butter, chese, 
mylke, crayme. &c.}] 
 
IN England there is 
no egges vsed to be eaten, but 
hen egges: wherfore I wyl fyrst 
wryte & pertract of hen egges. The yolkes of 
[^f.G3r^] 
hen egges be cordyalles, for it is temporatly 
hote. The whyte of an egge is viscus & colde 
and slacke of digestyon, and doth not ingender 
good blode, wherfore whosoeuer that wyl 
eate an egge, let the egge be newe, and roste 
hym reare and eate hym, or els poche hym for 
poched egges be best at nyght, & newe reare 
rosted egges be good in the mornynge so be 
it they be tyred with a lytell salte and suger, 
than they be nutryue. In Turkey and other 
hyghe chrystyan landes anexed to it, they vse 
to seth two or thre busshels of egges togither 
harde, and pull of the shels, & sowse them, and 
kepe them to eate at all tymes, but hard egges 
be slowe and slacke of dygestyon, and doth 
nutryfye the body grosly. Rosted egges be 
better than sodden, fryed egges be nought, 
Ducke egges & gese egges I do not prayse, 
but fesaunt egges and partreges egges physycke 
syngulerly doth prayse. 
 
[}Of butter.}] 
 
Butter made of crayme, and is moyste of 
operacion, it is good to eate in the mornyng 
before other meates, Frenche men wyll eate 
it after meate. But eaten with other meat~ it 
doth not onely nowrysshe, but it is good for 
the breste and lunges, and also it relaxe and 
[^f.G3v^] 
mollyfye the bely, douche men doth eate it at 
all tymes in the daye, the whiche I dyd not 
prayse when I dyd dwell amonge them/ consyderyng 
that butter is vnctyous, and euery 
thynge that is vnctyous is noysome to the 
stomacke for as moche as it maketh lubryfactyon. 
And also euery thyng that is vnctious 
That is to say butteryshe, oyle, grese, or fat 
dothe swymme aboue in the brynkes of the 
stomacke, as the fatnes doth swymme aboue 
in a boylynge potte, the excesse of suche 
nawtacyon or superfyce wyll ascende to the 
oryse of the stomacke, and doth make eructuasyons/ 
wherfore eatynge of moche butter at 
one refection is not co~me~dable, nor it is not 
good for theym the whiche be in any ague or 
feuer, for the ventuosyte of it dothe auge and 
augment the heate of the lyuer, a lytell porcyon 
is good for euery man in the morenynge 
yf it be newe made. 
 
[}Of Chese.}] 
 
Chese is made of mylke, yet there is .iiii. 
sortes of chese: whiche is to say, grene chese, 
softe chese, harde chese, and spermyse/ Grene 
chese is not called grene by the reason of 
colour, but for the newnes of it/ for the whey 
is not halfe pressed out of it, and in operacyon 
[^f.G4r^] 
it is colde and moyste. Softe chese not to 
new nor to olde is best, for in operacyon it is 
hote and moyste. Harde chese is hote and dry 
and euyll to dygest. Spermyse is a chese the 
which is made with curdes and with the iuce 
of herbes, to tell the nature of it I can not/ 
consyderynge that euery mylke wyfe maye 
put many iuces of herbes of sondry operacyon 
& vertue, one not agreynge with another. 
But and yf they dyd knowe what they dyd 
gomble togyther without trewe compoundynge, 
and I knowynge the herbes, then I 
coulde tell the operacyon of spermyse chese, 
Yet besyde these .iiii. natures of chese, there is 
a chese called a rewene chese, the whiche yf it 
be well orderyd doth passe all other cheses none 
excesse taken. But take the best chese of all 
these rehersyd, yf a latel do good and pleasur 
The ouerplus doth inge~dre grose humours 
for it is harde of dygestyon, it maketh a man 
costyfe and it is not good for the stone. Chese 
that is good,oughte not be to harde nor to 
softe, but betwyxt both, it shuld not be towgh 
nor bruttell, it ought not to be swete nor sowre, 
nor tarte, nor to salt, nor to fresshe, it must 
be of good sauour & taledge, nor full of iyes 
nor mytes, nor magottes/ yet in hyghalmen 
[^f.G4v^] 
the chese the whiche is full of magotes is called 
there the best chese, and they wyll eate the 
great magot~ as fast as we do eate comfet~. 
 
[}Of Mylke,}] 
 
Mylke of a woman, and the mylke of a gote 
is a good restoratyue, wherfore these mylkes 
be good for them that be in a consumpcyon, 
and for the great temperaunce the whiche is 
in them it doth nowrysshe moche. 
 
Cowes mylke and ewes mylke, so be it the 
beestes be yonge and do go in good pasture, 
the mylke is nutrytyue and doth humect and 
moysteth the membres, and doth mundyfye 
and clense the entrayles, and doth alleuyat & 
mytygate the payne of the lunges & the brest 
but it is not good for them the whiche haue 
gurgulacyons in the bely, nor it is not al the 
best for sanguyne me~/ but it is very good for 
melancoly men, & for olde men and chyldren 
specyally yf it be soddyn, addynge to it a lytell 
sugre. 
 
[}Of Crayme.}] 
 
Crayme the which dothe not stande longe 
on the mylke & soddyn with a lytell suger 
is nowrysshynge. Clowtyd crayme and rawe 
crayme put togyther, is eaten more for a sensuall 
appetyde, than for any good nowrysshement. 
[^f.H1r^] 
Rawe crayme vndecocted eaten with 
strawberyes, or hurtes is a rurall mans bauket. 
I haue knowen such bankettes hath put 
men in ieoperdy of theyr lyues. 
 
[}Almon butter.}] 
 
Almon butter made with fyne suger and 
good rose water, and eaten with the flowers 
of many vyolettes, is a co~mendable dysshe, 
specyallye in lent whan the vyolet~ be fragra~t 
it reioyseth the herte: it doth comforte y~ brayne: 
& doth qualyfye the heate of the lyuer. 
 
[}Beene butter.}] 
 
Beene butter, is vsed moche in lent in dyuers 
countres, it is good for plowmen to fyl 
the panche, it doth ingender grose humours, 
it doth replete a man with ventosyte. 
 
[}The .xiiij. Chapytre 
treatyth of Fysshe.}] 
 
OF all nacyons & cou~tres, 
Englande is beste seruyd 
of Fysshe, not onely of all maner 
of see fysshe, but also of fresshe 
water fysshe, and of all maner of sortes 
of salte fysshe. 
 
[}Of See fysshe.}] 
 
[^f.H1v^] 
Fysshes of the see the which haue skales or 
many fynnes, be more holsomer than y~ fresshe 
water fysshe, the whiche be in standynge 
waters. The elder a fysshe is so moche he is 
the better, so be it that the fysshe be softe and 
not solydat, yf the fysshe be faste and solydat 
the yonger the fysshe is, the better it is to dygest: 
but this is to vnderstande, that yf the 
fysshe be neuer so solydat it muste haue age/ 
but not ouergrowen: except it be a yonge porpesse 
the which kynde of fisshe is nother praysed 
in the olde testament nor in physycke. 
 
[}Fresshe water fysshe.}] 
 
The fysshe the whiche is in ryuers and brokes 
be more holsomer, than they the which be 
in pooles, pondes, or moot~, or any other sta~dynge 
waters, for they doth laboure and doth 
skower them selfe. Fysshe the whiche lyueth & 
doth feede on the moude, or els do feede in y~ 
fen or morysshe grou~de, doth sauer of y~ moude 
whiche is not so good as the fysshe that fedyth 
and doth skowre them self on the stones 
or grauell or sande. 
 
[}Of Salte fysshe.}] 
 
Salte fysshe, the whiche be powderyd and 
salted with salte, be not greatly to be praysed 
specyally yf a man do make his hoole refectyon 
[^f.H2r^] 
with it the qualyte doth not hurte, but the 
quantyte, specyally suche salte fysshes as wyll 
cleue to the fyngers whan a man doth eate it. 
And y~ skyn of fysshes be vtterly to be abhorryd, 
for it doth ingender vyscus fleume and 
color adust. Al maner of fysshe is colde of nature, 
and doth ingender fleume, it doth lytell 
nowrysshe/ Fysshe and flesshe oughte not to 
be eaten togyther at one meale. 
 
[}The .xv. Chapitre, treateth of 
wylde fowle, and tame 
fowle byrdes.}] 
 
OF al wylde foule, 
the Fesaunt is most 
beste: Althoughe that a 
partreche of all fowles 
is soonest dygested. 
wherfore it is a restoratyue 
meate, and dothe 
comforte the brayne and the stomacke: & doth 
augment carnall lust. A wood cocke is a meate 
of good temperaunce. Quayles & plouers 
and lapwynges doth nowrysshe but lytel, for 
they doth ingender mela~coly humours, yonge 
turtyll doues dothe ingender good blode. 
[^f.H2v^] 
A crane is harde of dygestyon, and doth inge~der 
euyll blode. A yonge herensew is lyghter 
of dygestyon than a crane. A bustarde 
well kylled and orderyd is a nutrytyue meate. 
A byttoure is not so harde of dygestyon as 
is an herensew. A shoueler is lyghter of dygestyon 
than a byttoure, all these be noyfull 
except they be well orderyd and dressyd. A fesaunt 
henne. A more cocke and a more henne 
except they be sutt abrode they be nutrytyue 
All maner of wylde fowle the whiche lyueth 
by the water they be of dysco~mendable nowrysshement. 
 
[}Of tame or domestycall fowle.}] 
 
Of all tame fowle a capon is moste beste. 
For it is nutrytyue and is soone dygestyd. 
A henne in wynter is good and nutrytyue. 
And so is a chyken in somer, specyallye cockrellys 
and polettes, the whiche be vntroden. 
The flesshe of a cocke is harde of dygestyon: 
but the broth or gely made of a cocke is restoratyue, 
pygyons be good for coloryke & melancoly 
men, gose flesshe and ducke flesshe is 
not praysed except it be a yonge grene goose 
yo~ge peechyken of halfe a yere of age be praysed, 
olde pecockes be harde of dygestyon. 
 
[}Of Byrdes.}] 
 
[^f.H3r^] 
All maner of smale Byrdes, be good and 
lyght of dygestyon, excepte sparowes whiche 
be harde of dygestyon, Tytmoses, colmoses 
and wrens, the whiche doth eate spyders and 
poyson be not co~me~dable, of all smale byrdes 
the larke is beste: than is praysed y~ blacke byrde 
& the thrusshe. Rasis and Isaac prayseth 
yonge staares, but I do thynke bycause they 
be bytter in etyng, they shuld inge~der colour. 
 
[}The .xvi. Chapytre treatyth 
of flesshe, of wylde and 
tame beestes.}] 
 
BEefe is a good meate 
for an Englysshe man, 
so be it the beest be yonge, & 
that it be not kowe flesshe. 
For olde beefe and kowe flesshe 
doth ingender melancolye and leporouse 
humoures: yf it be moderatly powderyd that 
the groose blode by salte may be exhaystyd, it 
doth make an Englysshe man stro~ge the educacion 
of hym with it co~syderyd. Martylmas 
beef whiche is called hanged beef in the rofe 
of the smoky howse is not laudable, it maye 
fyll the bely, and cause a man to drynke, but 
[^f.H3v^] 
it is euyll for the stone, and euyll of dygestyon 
and maketh no good iuce. If a man haue 
a peace hangynge by his syde and another in 
his bely, that the whiche doth hange by the syde 
shall do hym more good yf a showre of rayne 
do chaunse: than that the which is in his bely, 
the appetyde of mans sensualyte notwithstandynge. 
 
[}Of Veale.}] 
 
Veale is nutrytyue meate: and doth nowrysshe 
moche a man, for it is soone dygestyd, 
wherupon many men doth holde oppynyon 
that it is the beste flesshe and the moste nutrytyue 
meate that can be for mans sustenau~ce. 
 
[}Of Mutton and lambe.}] 
 
Mutton of Rasis and Aueroyes, is praysed 
for a good meate, but Galen dothe not 
laude it, and sewrely I do not loue it consyderyng 
that there is no beest that is so soone 
infectyd: nor there doth happen so great murren 
and syckenes to any quadrypedyd beeste 
as doth fall to the sheepe. This notwithstandynge, 
yf the sheepe be brought vp in a good 
pasture and fatte and do not flauoure of the 
wolle it is good for sycke persons, for it doth 
ingender good blode. 
 
Lambes flesshe is moyste and flumatycke 
[^f.H4r^] 
wherfore it is not all the best for olde men, excepte 
they be melancolye of complexyon, it is 
not good for flumatyke men to feade to moche 
of it doth hurte. 
 
[}Of Porke browne, bakon, & pygge.}] 
 
where as Galen with other auncyent and 
approbat doctours doth prayse porke I dare 
not say the contrarye agaynst them, but this 
I am sure of, I dyd neuer loue it: And in holy 
scrypture it is not praysed, for a swyne is 
an vnclene beest and dothe lye vpon fylthy & 
stynkynge soyles, and with stercorus matter 
dyuers tymes doth fede in Englande, yet in 
Hyghalmen and other hygh countres except 
(spayne & other countres anexed to spayne) 
doth kepe theyr swyne clene, and dothe cause 
them ones or twyse a daye to swy~me in great 
ryuers, lyke the water of Ryne, whiche is aboue 
Coleyne, but spaynyerdes with the other 
regions anexed to them, kepe the swyne more 
fylthyer than englysse persons doth. Further 
more, the Ieue, the Sarason, the Turkes, co~sernynge 
theyr polytycke wyt and lerenyng 
in physycke, hath as moche wyt, wysdom, reason, 
and knowlege for the sauyte of theyr body: 
as any chrysten man hath, and noble physycyons, 
I haue knowen amonges them: yet 
[^f.H4v^] 
they all lacked grace, for as moche as they do 
not knowe or knowledge Iesu chryste, as the 
holy scrypture tellyth vs and them. They louyth 
not porke nor swynes flesshe, but doth vituperat 
& abhorre it, yet for all this they wyll 
eate adders, whiche is a kynde of serpentes, 
as well as any other crysten man dwellynge 
in Rome, & other hyghe countres, for adders 
flesshe there is called fysshe of the mountayn. 
This notwithstandynge physycke doth approbat 
adders flesshe good to be eaten, sayinge 
it dothe make an olde man yonge, as it 
apperyth by a harte eatyng an adder makyth 
hym yonge agayne. But porke doth not so, 
for yf it be of an olde hogge not clene kepte 
it doth ingender grose blode, & doth humect 
to moche the stomacke, yet yf y~ porke be yonge 
it is nutrytyue. 
 
Bacon is good for carters and plowmen, 
the whiche be euer labourynge in the earth or 
dunge, but & yf they haue the stone and vse 
to eate it they shall synge wo be the pye: wherfore 
I do say that coloppes and egges, is as 
holsome for them: as a talowe candell is good 
for a horse mouth, or a peese of powdred beef 
is good for a blereyed mare, yet sensuall appetyde 
must haue a swynge, all these thinges 
[^f.I1r^] 
not withstandynge, porke is conuertyble to mans 
flesshe. 
 
[}Of Brawne.}] 
 
Brawne is an vsual meate in wynter amo~ges 
Englysshe men, it is harde of dygestyon 
the brawne of a wylde boore is moche more 
better than the brawne of a tame boore. yf a 
man eate nother of them bothe it shall neuer 
do hym harme. 
 
[}Of Pygges.}] 
 
Pygges specyally sowe pygges is nutrytyue 
and made in a gelye, it is restoratyue so 
be it the pygge be fleed the skyn taken of, and 
than stewed with restoratyues, as a cocke is 
stewed to make a gely. A yonge fatte pygge 
in physicke is syngulerly praysed yf it be wel 
orderyd in the rostynge, the skyn not eaten. 
 
[}Of Kydde.}] 
 
Yonge Kyddes flesshe is praysed aboue all 
other flesshe, as Auicen, Rasis, & Aueroyes 
sayth, for it is temperate and nutrytyue although 
it be somwhat dry. Olde kydde is not 
praysed. 
 
[}Of wylde beestes flesshe.}] 
 
I haue gone rownde aboute crystendome 
and ouerthwarte crystendom, & a thousande 
or two and more myles out of crystendom, 
[^f.I1v^] 
yet there is not so moche pleasure for harte & 
hynde, bucke, and doo: and for roo bucke and 
doo, as is in Englande, & although the flesshe 
be dispraysed in physycke/ I pray god to sende 
me part of the flesshe to eate physycke not 
withstandyng. The opynyon of all olde physycyons 
was & is that venyson is not good 
to eate pryncipaylly for two cause, the fyrste 
cause is that the beest doth lyue in fere: for yf 
he be a good wood man, he shall neuer se no 
kynde of deere, but at the .x. byt on the grasse, 
or brosynge on the tree, but he wyll lyfte vp 
his hed & loke aboute hym, the whiche co~meth 
of tymorysnes, and tymorosyte doth brynge 
in melancoly humours. wherfore all Phyonsuchons 
sayth that venyson which is the seco~de 
cause doth ingender coloryke humours & 
of trueth it doth so: wherfore let them take the 
skyn and let me haue the flesshe, I am sure it 
is a lordes dysshe, and I am sure it is good 
for an Englysshe man, for it doth anymate 
hym to be as he is: whiche is stronge and hardy/ 
but I do aduertyse euery man for all my 
wordes not to kyll and so to eate of it except 
it be lefully, for it is a meate for great men. 
And great men do not set so moch by y~ meate 
as they do by the pastyme of kyllyng of it. 
 
[^f.I2r^] 
[}Of Hares flesshe.}] 
 
A hare doth no harme nor dyspleasure to 
no man, yf the flesshe be not eaten, it maketh 
a gentylman good pastyme. And better it is 
for the hound~ or dogges to eate y~ hare after 
they haue kylled it, as I sayd than man shuld 
eate it: for it is not praysed nother in the olde 
Testament nother in physycke, for the byble 
sayth the hare is an vnclene beeste. And physycke 
sayeth hares flesshe is drye and doth ingender 
melancoly humors. 
 
[}Of Conys flesshe.}] 
 
Conys flesshe is good, but rabettes flesshe 
is beste of al wylde beestes/ for it is temperat 
and doth nowrysshe, and syngulerly praysed 
in physycke, for all thynges the whiche dothe 
sucke is nutrytyue. 
 
[}The .xvij. Chapytre, doth treate 
of pertyculer thynges, of 
fysshe and flesshe.}] 
 
THe heddes of fysshe, 
and the fatnes of fysshe specyally 
of Samon and Conger 
is not good for them the whiche 
be dysposed to haue rewmatycke 
heddes. And y~ heddes of lampryes 
[^f.I2v^] 
& lamprons, & the strynge the whiche is within 
theym, is not good to eate. refrayne from 
etynge of the skynnes of fysshe, and flesshe & 
bornet meate, and browne meate, for it doth 
ingender viscus humours, and color & melancoly. 
And doth make opylacions. The braynes 
of any beest is not laudable excepte the 
brayne of a kydde, for it is euyl of digestyon 
and doth hurte a mans appetyde and the stomacke, 
for it is colde and moyste, and viscus 
a hote stomacke may eate it, but it doth inge~der 
grose humours. The brayne of a wodcocke 
and of a snype and suche lyke is co~mestyble. 
The foreparte of all maner of beestes & 
fowles be more hotter and lyghter of digestyon, 
than the hynder partes be. The marye of 
all beestes is hote and moyste, it is nutrityue 
yf it be wel dygestyd, yet it doth mollyfy the 
stomacke, and doth take away a mans appetyde. 
wherfore let a man eate peper with it. 
The blode of all beestes & fowles is not praysed, 
for it is hard of digestyon. All y~ inward~ 
of beestes and of fowles, as the herte the lyuer 
the lunges, and trypes, and trylybubbes: 
wyth all the intrayles, is harde of dygestyon, 
and doth increase grose humoures. The fatnes 
of flesshe is not so moche nutrytyue as 
[^f.I3r^] 
the leenes of flesshe, it is best whan leene and 
fat is myxte one with another. The tunges 
of beestes be harde of dygestyon and of lytell 
nowrysshement. The stones of a cockrell, & 
the stones of other beestes that hath not done 
theyr kynde be nutrytyue. 
 
[}The .xviij. Chapitre, treatyth 
of roste meate, of fryed meate 
and of bake meate.}] 
 
WIth vs at Mou~tpylour, 
and other vnyuersyties 
is vsed boyled meate 
at dyner, and roste meate 
to supper: why they shulde 
do so I can not tell onlesse 
it be for a consuetude. For boyled meate 
is lyghter of digestyon than rosted meate is. 
Bruled meate is harde of digestyon, & euyll 
for the stone. Fryed meate is harder of dygeston 
than brulyd meate is, and it doth ingender 
color and melancoly: Bake meate which 
is called flesshe that is beryd, for it is buryd i~ 
paast, is not praysed in physycke. All maner 
of flesshe the which is inclyned to humydyte 
shulde be rostyd. And all flesshe the whiche is 
[^f.I3v^] 
inclyned to drynes shulde be sodde or boyled. 
 
Fysshe may be sod, rostyd, brulyd & baken, 
euery one after theyr kynde, and vse & fasshyon 
of the countree, as the coke and the physycyon 
wyll agre and deuyse. For a good coke 
is halfe a physycyon. For the chefe physycke 
(the counceyll of a physycyon excepte) dothe 
come from the kytchyn, wherfore y~ physycyon 
and the coke for sycke men muste consult 
togyther for the preparacion of meate for sycke 
men. For yf the physycyon without the coke 
prepare any meate excepte he be very experte, 
he wyll make a werysse dysshe of meate, 
the whiche the sycke can not take.

[}Of Artochockes, and Rokat.}] 
 
There is nothynge vsed to be eaten of Artochockes
