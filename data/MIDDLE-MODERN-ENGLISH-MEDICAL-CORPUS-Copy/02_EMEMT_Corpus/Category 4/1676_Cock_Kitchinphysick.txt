[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
[}Laz.}] I Am glad, Sir, to find you 
within: I have brought 
you a water, and desire your opinion 
of the party that sends 
it. 
 
[}Phil.}] Not to keep you in 
suspense, without any more ado, 
there is no certain judgement 
to be given by Urine; 
whatever is done that way, 
which so amuseth you and others, 
is by collusion, fraud and 
confederacie. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[}Laz.}] Why then, Sir, do you 
Physicians permit us to bring 
our Waters? besides, there are 
those, that do undertake to tell 
us, who, and what the party 
is; whether they shall live or 
dye, and much more to this 
purpose, which I forbear to 
trouble you with. 
 
[}Phil.}] Well Lazarus, take it 
for an undoubted truth, that 
they are all but impudent lyes, 
and contriv'd stories to drive 
on some design and interest: and 
if you will credit me, some of 
the chief and archest of them 
have confest as much to me; 
besides, (as ignorant (as you 
make your self) you cannot 
imagine such silly illiterate persons, 
as generally they all are, 
that boast of these mighty deeds, 
and upon enquiry are found to 
be either conceited Women, or 
some decay'd, bold, ignorant 
[^p.19^] 
Mechanicks: nay, High waymen, 
Bauds, and common Strumpets, 
Gypsies, Witches and 
Conjurers, commonly call'd 
cunning men and women 
should be most famous in this 
profession. Is it to be supposed, 
that all Universities, Colleges 
and learned Societies, (as our 
Mempsis will have it) throughout 
the whole world, could remain 
ignorant, after the greatest 
endeavours they could use, as 
upon Record, and in all their 
Writings they solemnly protest 
they do) if any such thing as 
these persons boast of by Urin, 
or their Universal Medicines, 
were to be known or attain'd 
unto? 
 
[}Laz.}] Truly, Sir, there is 
something in what you say, and 
it seems to call in question ones 
discretion to believe all that is 
talk'd of: But I pray, Sir, would 
[^p.20^] 
you not have us then bring the 
Patients water when we come 
to you? 
 
[}Phil.}] Yes, by all means good 
Lazarus, bnt not with any expectation 
of conjuring; for 
though there be no certain 
knowledge of any Disease, nor 
any safe judgement to be given 
only by the Urine; yet it serves 
often times to indicate or hint 
something to us. 
 
[}Laz.}] If Urine be thus uncertain, 
and insignificant; I pray, 
Sir, then how came this custom 
into such request, and what still 
continues the repute and use 
of it? 
 
[}Phil.}] All the account I can 
give you of the original and 
growth of this errour is, chiefly 
the ignorance, and credulity of 
the vulgar, either in not apprehending 
the devices, secret 
combinations, and strategems of 
[^p.21^] 
these jugling Uro-manticks; or else 
the peoples mistake, and fond 
conceit in thinking the Physicians 
chiefest skill lay in the Urine, 
meerly because they observed 
them to view usually the 
water, when they visited the 
sick; and on this mistake, but 
chiefly to prevent the charge 
of visits, as also the Physicians 
condescention to the imposition, 
has occasion'd the use of 
this pernicious custom. But 
because there are some other errors 
I would advise you of in 
their proper place, I shall conclude 
this Section, with these 
few directions. 
 
[}I.}] 
 
That whenever you visit the 
Physician, you ever bring with 
you the sick persons water: only 
that it may be in a readiness, 
if the Physician sees occasion to 
[^p.22^] 
require it, but not with any expectation 
of being resolv'd any 
thing that is certain and material 
by it. 
 
[}II.}] 
 
Though the Physician should 
omit to ask, yet do not you 
forget to tell him all you know 
of the sick: tell him his age, 
sex, calling, complexion, habit 
of body and constitution: his 
customs in eating and drinking, 
and what course of life he has 
led: what time he was first taken: 
whether he has a vomiting, 
or looseness, or both: whether 
he sleeps much, or wants it, 
or has a cough, stitches, or pains 
in any part: whether his thirst 
be great, or he sweat much, and 
in what part most, or whatever 
else the sick person at that present 
labours under, and complains 
of; and be sure you do 
[^p.23^] 
not conceil what Medicines he 
has already taken by the advice, 
or perswasions of others; 
and who they were. 
 
[}III.}] 
 
Let your visits be at the beginning, 
and first onset of the 
Disease, and not be put off till 
the last, which makes the Disease, 
not only the more difficult, 
but dangerous also, and oftentimes 
proves fatal: you may as 
well, when your house is on 
fire, forbear going about presently 
to quench it. 
 
[}IV.}] 
 
When you have the direction 
of such a Physician as you 
ought to confide in; be sure 
you keep to him, and punctually 
in every particular observe his 
[^p.24^] 
directions; a little error herein, 
be it in your Diet or Physick, 
may be your death: and run 
not from one Physician to another, 
though perhaps more eminent 
and able than the first: 
it being a most certain truth, 
that Multitudo Medicorum, & 
Medicinarum, &c. A multitude 
of Medicines and Physicians do 
very often destroy the sick - But as 
to our present concern about 
Diet; take notice: That 
 
[}I.}] 
 
All tender, temperate, sedentary, 
and sickly people, all Infants, 
aged, idle and decrepit 
persons ought to eat often, but 
yet very little at once; because 
much food, (like much fewel 
thrown upon fire) extinguisheth 
their natural heat: and as 
weak and wasted bodies are to 
[^p.25^] 
be restored by little and little, 
so also by moist and liquid Aliments, 
rather that dry and solid, 
because, that kind of Diet 
does nourish soonest, and digest, 
and distribute easiest. 
 
[}II.}] 
 
Those that have an imperfect 
health, or are under any manifest 
Disease, and eat much, and 
get little strength by eating; 
'tis a sign they have used themselves 
to too full a Diet: and the 
more you cram and cherish such 
bodies; the less they shall thrive 
by it, but grow worse and worse; 
because, by much feeding, you 
do but increase the vitiated and 
bad humours, which should be 
wasted by Bleeding, Purging, 
or Abstinence. And this should 
caution all good Women, 
Nurses and Chymists, how they 
[^p.26^] 
importune, and impose upon 
sick persons, their comfortable, 
Cordial, and good things (as 
they call them) and continually 
encourage the sick, say the 
Physician what he will, to be 
eating one good thing or other 
to encourage the 
[/1./] Archeus: To reform 
this, and other unreasonable 
customs in Diet, was instituted 
in Old times, that Order 
of Physicians call'd Clinicks, 
or such as directed the 
diseased how to order themselves 
in sickness, which is now 
(the more is the pity) left to the 
discretion of every idle, conceited 
and ignorant Nurse or 
Gossip. 
 
[}III.}] 
 
Never, though in perfect 
health, eat at once, till your 
Appetite be quite satisfied: eat 
[^p.27^] 
not till you have an Appetite, 
and eat not so long till you have 
none, was Galens rule, who 
lived an hundred years without 
any manifest sickness: This 
Rule also the Emperour Aurelian, 
Cato, Seneca, and all the famous 
Dietists carefully observed, 
and without it esteemed 
Physick, but an insipid and 
insignificant thing - When we 
want our healths, we complain 
that we have taken cold, or 
eaten something hard of digestion, 
or make some such frivolous excuse 
or other; whereas, the real 
cause lyes in a long continued 
disorderly diet: 'Tis rare unless 
we offend in quantity, that any 
food that is common to us or 
mankind, does offend us by its 
Quality; if there be any such 
thing as Qualitie, as there is 
not, says Mempsis. 
 
[^p.28^] 
[}IV.}] 
 
If you have eaten or drank 
too much at once, use so much 
Exercise or Abstinence, before 
you so transgress again, as will 
perfectly digest the superfluity 
and excess of your former eating 
and drinking; or else there 
will be a necessity of being beholden 
to the extraordinary 
helps of Physick to prevent 
Gouts, Catarrhs, Scorbuts, loss 
of appetite, Crudities, Obstructions, 
Palsies, and what not? 
 
[}V.}] 
 
If you eat a large breakfast, 
eat no dinner: if you eat no 
dinner, eat an early supper: if 
you eat a supper, eat no breakfast: 
if no breakfast, eat an early 
dinner; and by this means 
[^p.29^] 
you will keep your stomack 
clean, strong and vigorous, and 
preserve thereby a good digestion, 
and distribution of your 
food. Custom and company 
cause us commonly (more than 
thirst and hunger) to eat and 
drink: but when hunger and 
thirst invite us; 'tis to be preferr'd 
before occasion and opportunity: 
But if you resolve 
both to breakfast, dine and sup, 
let your suppers be early and 
largest, your dinners least, and 
all the time after supper (if your 
occasions will permit) be dispos'd 
to honest and innocent recreations 
and mirth. 
 
[}VI.}] 
 
Keep constantly to a plain, 
simple, and single Diet: none 
enjoy more health, and live 
longer, than those that avoid 
[^p.30^] 
variety and curiosity of meats 
and drinks, which only serve to 
entice us to our own ruine: 
Note also, that when you are 
directed to a Diet, you keep 
most to those Aliments in that 
Chapter, which least offend 
your stomack, and most refresh 
& please your fancy, to this end 
let the sick, or some for him, be 
often reading over the ensuing 
Chapters for Diet: and if your 
food be solid, hard or dry, besure 
to chew it well, and drink 
the oftner. 
 
[}VII.}] 
 
Begin your meals, with something 
actually hot, and such 
things as nourish most, viz. 
things that are sweet, thin, luscious 
and liquid, moist, slipery, 
and most passible, as Cherries, 
Apples, Pears, but above all 
things Flumory: But all solid, 
[^p.31^] 
hard, dry, acid, sower, sharp 
and astringent meats and drinks 
are to be used last. 
 
[}VIII.}] 
 
If at any time, yet at meals 
drink not much at once, rather 
drink often and little: This 
will make the meat and drink 
mix well in your stomach; prevent 
Fluctuations, crudities and 
sower belchings; also (for most) 
morning, draughts of strong 
drinks and frequent compotations, 
or tipling betwixt meals 
are to be avoided. 
 
[}X.}] 
 
When you are in perfect 
health or temper, eat and 
drink things temperate: and 
when distempered and sick, eat 
and drink things contrary to 
[^p.32^] 
your distemper and sickness, 
though not contrary to your 
stomach and appetite: you may 
gratifie Nature, but not your disease, 
v. 8. If your Disease be cold, 
your Diet (though it dislike your 
fancy) must be both actually and 
vertually hot: and if your Disease 
or Constitution be hot, 
your Diet must be cold or 
cooling; and so of all other 
Diseases according to the Chapters 
hereunto annex'd: and ever 
more remember, that an 
erroneus, and irregular Diet 
will undo, all that the Physician, 
or Physick can do for you: 
and Galen (a man as much to be 
believ'd and depended on as 
Mempsis) in his Tract de Theriae 
affirms all Remedies ineffectual 
without due Diet. 
 
[}X.}] 
 
The particular Chapters for 
[^p.33^] 
Diet (there being variety enough 
in every Chapter) must 
be exactly kept to; and no other 
food made use of, than is 
mentioned in those Chapters, 
till the Disease be cured, let 
standers by, and Dogmatick 
Chymists, say what they will 
to the contrary: 'tis keeping 
to a proper Diet that cures, 
and without this, they do but 
Insanire, or act like mad-men 
that either give or take Physick. 
 
[}Lastly.}] 
 
And above all things; devoutly 
invocate God for his Benediction, 
without which, neither 
Paul nor Apollo, Galenist 
nor Chymist, Food nor Physick 
can do any thing; as is more 
amply thus signified in the 
words of Sirac to his son Jesus: 
In thy sickness pray unto 
the Lord, and he will make thee 
[^p.34^] 
whole: Leave off from sin, and 
order thy ways aright; and 
cleanse thy heart from all wickedness: 
Then give place to the 
Physician; for the Lord hath 
created him: the hour may come 
that their endeavours may have 
good success: for they also shall 
pray unto the Lord, that he would 
prosper that, which is given for 
the prolonging of life: for the 
Lord hath created food and Medicines 
out of the Earth, and he 
that is wise will not abhor them: 
and he hath given men skill, that 
he might be honoured in his marvellous 
works; for, of the Most 
High only cometh Healing. 
 
[}Phil.}] But to come a little 
nigher the business I aim at: 
pray tell me Eugenius, what sick 
people have lately been with 
you? and how mannage you 
that affair of Paupers? 
 
[}Eugen.}] There was with me 
[^p.35^] 
just now a Lazar, so afflicted 
with the Bloody flux, and so 
extremely indigent; that he 
has neither house nor home, 
friend nor money, and what to 
do with him, I know not. 
 
[}Phil.}] Give him two or three 
drops of the Doctors Pseudo-chymical, 
Alexi-stomachon: A 
good draught of Pepper poet, 
Egg-caudle, Mace-ale, mull'd 
Sack, or burnt Claret; it may be 
will do as well. 
 
[}Eugen.}] But Sir! the man is 
almost dead, and starv'd with 
cold and hunger, and has no 
two or three shillings, nor farthings 
to buy the Doctors 
drops, or a bit of bread! 
 
[}Phil.}] You must resolve then 
to relieve him, or let him 
dye. 
 
[}Eugen.}] That's a hard saying: 
I am loth he should perish, and 
yet to relieve all that may on 
[^p.36^] 
this account come to me, is to 
ruine my self. 
 
[}Phil.}] That's more than you 
know Eugenius: Providence is 
not so dead and dull a thing, 
as too many make it: he that 
bad the young man sell all he 
had, and, &c. knew how to recompence 
his Faith, and confidence 
in God: besides, you 
and I, have our names for 
nought, if we look no further 
than self and interest: Be but 
you faithful in not imposing 
upon poor; and careful in serving 
and saving the Patient, 
(be he poor or rich) and never 
question an honest satisfaction: 
As Paupers cannot pay, so also, 
prudent and generous Patients 
will not, let Art and Industry 
go unmaintain'd. 
 
[}Eugen.}] Wou'd you have me 
then, Sir, give him Physick 
gratis? 
 
[^p.37^] 
[}Phil.}] I, I, Eugenius; good 
convenient food and money 
too, if you are convinc'd he is 
such a real pauper, as he says 
he is; or else all the Alexi-stomachons, 
Polyceas, Panaceas, 
and Ambrosiopæas, that you, or 
the Hermetick Doctor can give 
him, will do him little good: 
here, bid him provide him a 
good warm lodging, and buy 
himself a pound or two of Rice, 
and let him torrifie, or parch it 
a little, as he is to use it, in a hot 
fire-shovel or frying-pan; or 
bake it for bread with a few 
Seeds, Nutmeg, Pepper or Cynamon, 
and eat nor drink any 
thing but Rice, thus prepared 
with scalded Milk, or Milk and 
Water, for seven or eight days, 
and your Patient, Eugenius, may 
live, to deride, and laugh at all 
the twelve-penny drops of Chymists, 
and charitable cheats of 
[^p.38^] 
poor needy Mountebanks and 
Mechanicks. 
 
[}Eugen.}] Would you have me, 
Sir, use nothing else but Rice? 
'Tis a great disease he labours 
under, and methinks Rice 
should not master it. 
 
[}Phil.}] If it does not; give him 
often a dose of honest Diascordium, 
or (if that should fail) of 
our Hypnotick tincture, and 
Cordial Spirits: But you forget, 
Eugenius, that I told you, 
great diseases may be cured by 
keeping to ordinary Medicines 
proper for them. 
 
[}Eugen.}] But Rice, Sir, is no 
Medicine: 'tis so common 
a food, that I wonder you 
should count it for Physick any 
more than Bread! 
 
[}Phil.}] I count Bread, and every 
thing we eat and drink 
Physick, provided it be contrary 
to a Disease: For instance, 
[^p.39^] 
if instead of a loose and moist 
belly, your patient was troubled 
with a hard, dry, and 
costive belly; what Medicines? 
what Alexi-stomachons and Panpharmacons 
can do more, if so 
much, as such meats as moisten 
the guts and stomach? Sc. 
Pruens, Pears, Apples, Butter, 
Oyl, Watergruel, Flumory, 
French barly, Spinage, and 
many such like moist and anodine 
Aliments, of which hereafter: 
and when the bowels and 
stomach are over moist, relax'd, 
and slippery as in your present 
Patient; what can Physick do 
more than gradually, as Rice 
does, both heal, alter, bind, dry 
and strengthen; especially as 
it may be cook'd? And you 
would find it, Eugenius, a hard 
task to tell me of any one Disease, 
that I cannot hope to relieve 
or cure by a proper Diet, 
[^p.40^] 
and very little else, as safely and 
surely, though not perhaps so 
suddenly, as the proudest Medicine 
the Chymist can produce. 
 
What Disease is there that 
proceeds not from some of the 
simple or compound qualities; 
and though no man is so compleatly 
wise, as to explicate 
them in all their causes and effects, 
which makes Mempsis absolutely 
deny, their is any such 
thing as qualities, which is no 
less absur'd, than to affirm 
there's no such thing as Summer 
and Winter, or Fire 
and Water, because in all things we 
know not their causes and effects, 
and yet 'tis certain, they 
really exist, and are (by the Suns 
absence, or more immediate 
presence) made up of such qualities, 
as we call, hot, dry, cold 
and moist: and as certain 'tis, 
[^p.41^] 
that all essential Diseases are 
caused, and all Medicines cure 
those essential Diseases, by some 
or all of those four qualities, 
hot, cold, dry or moist: And 
what meats are there not, as 
well as Medicines, that are not 
in one degree or other opposite 
to those causes? And if so, 
as so it is, what hinders then (as 
strange as the Chymist makes 
it) that food may perform 
those cures, and if you please, 
not improperly be call'd Physick, 
there being this only difference 
betwixt Food and Physick, 
that in health Nature, i.e. 
his Archeus, requires things Homogeneal, 
or of like qualities 
and temper to its self; but in 
sickness, things Heterogeneal, or 
of contrary qualities to the Disease, 
the neglect of which absolute 
and necessary distinction 
makes the Chymist so sceptical 
as he is. 
 
[^p.42^] 
Of such force and power is 
food for the preventing and 
curing diseases, that I could 
name you no meaner a Master 
of Physick than Avicen himself, 
who cured (to use his own 
words) innumerable Diseases 
by Diet; and esteemed it so 
honest (as indeed it is) safe, 
easie, pleasant, and useful a 
science, that no good, nor 
wise men (but the Chymist) 
would neglect or undervalue it: 
However, if Diet should, (as in 
some sudden and great Diseases, 
it sometimes does) prove ineffectual, 
you are hereby no more 
prohibited the judicious use of 
greater Medicines, in such great 
and violent Diseases, than the 
blowing up houses, to prevent 
and put out fires, when such 
natural and rational helps as 
water will not do it. And that 
I may no longer detain you 
[^p.43^] 
from what at first I most intended; 
I shall without any more 
ado, in several distinct Chapters 
propose you a proper Diet 
for Diseases; by the help of 
which, our Cordial Spirits, &c. 
I can with the satisfaction of a 
good conscience assure the Reader, 
that he may safely, and 
with good success (especially 
where the Physician cannot visit 
the Patient) practise on himself, 
and avoid the danger of 
putting themselves into the 
hands of Pseudo-Chymists, silly 
Women, Mountebanks, Mechanicks, 
Fortune tellers, and 
such like cheats. And to do 
this, there needs not much 
more, than to be directed, or 
have the opinion of some honest 
and able Physician, whether 
your Disease be mixt, or 
comes immediately from a hot, 
a cold, a dry, or moist cause, 
[^p.44^] 
and then, as you are directed 
by these ensuing Chapters; to 
use a mixt or simple Diet contrary 
unto that cause. 
 
[}Chap. I. 
 
Treats of a Cold or cooling Diet, 
for Hot Diseases and Constitutions.}] 
 
THere is nothing that we 
can think on, that belongs 
to Aliments so absolutely 
necessary, so good cheap, 
and easie to be attain'd, as water, 
without which the whole 
Universe must stand still, or run 
into immediate confusion. 
 
It's peculiar prerogative is, to 
moisten, cool, relax, relieve 
ease pain, evacuate, thicken, 
thin, and contributes something 
to all the active and passive 
[^p.45^] 
Qualities, Dryness, only 
excepted: By its cold and moist 
Qualities it quenches Choler, 
and Lenifies sharp, acid, salt, 
and adust humours, and relieves 
all inflamations, inward and 
outward, and is the only potent 
refuge for all volatil, saline, 
thin and sharp bloods. 
 
A glass of good spring Water, 
with a little toast, and a little 
loaf-suger mix'd, is a very 
good mornings draught, for all 
hot, lean, sanguine, cholerick, 
and hectick persons. So is Water 
Caudle made thus: Take 
three pints of Water, boil in 
it a little Rosemary or Mace, 
till it comes to a quart, then 
beat up an Egg and put some of 
the scalding hot water to it, 
then give it a wame or two; 
aad with a little Sugar, drink it 
hot or cold; three pints of 
Spring water put to one pint 
[^p.46^] 
of Milk with Sugar-candy, or 
double refin'd Sugar, is a drink 
that Princes may, and do often 
refresh themselves with. So also 
is running Water with a Lemon, 
and some part of the Rine 
slit into it thin, and a little Sugar 
and Wine put to it; or Syrup 
of Raspberries, Baum, Violets, 
Mint, or Clove-gilly-flowers; 
you cannot take too much 
of it, in ardent Fevers out of a 
bottle cork'd close, and a quill 
run through the cork to drink 
out of: Note, that raw cold 
Water, in Fevers, Inflamations, 
and Cholerick Thirst, being 
drank at once in great quantity 
may cause obstructions, and many 
dangerous Diseases, as Dropsies, 
&c. 
 
But if you first boil well the water, 
and use it after it is again perfectly 
cold, instead of obstructing 
it will deobstruate, or open obstructions, 
[^p.47^] 
and may thus be given 
at any time, in all sorts of Fevers, 
either malignant or ardent, especially 
it a little White-wine 
Vinegar be mix'd with it. 
 
That Water is best, which is 
insipid, or without taste, clean, 
light and bright; but to make 
bad water good, and good water 
better, boil it well, and then 
let it cool again before you 
use it. 
 
Of Water is made Water-gruel 
(the sick man's Food and 
Physick) when the Archeus abhors 
all Cordials and high Diet: 
this is ever very acceptable and 
pleasing, and consequently, not 
to be neglected by Mempsis 
himself, there are these several 
ways of making it: 
 
Take two pints of River or 
Spring Water, boil it first, and 
then let it cool again; then put 
to it a due proportion of Oatmeal, 
[^p.48^] 
a handful of Sorrel, and 
a good quantity of pick'd and 
well wash'd Currants, (eston'd 
Raisins of the Sun, and other 
ingredients, as the Disease will 
permit, may also be added) tye 
up these ingredients loosely in 
a fine thin linnen cloth or bag: 
boil them all well together 
(with or without a little Mace, 
Nutmeg, Rosemary, &c. as occasion 
offers) when 'tis sufficiently 
boil'd, strain the Oat-meal, 
and press out all the juyce or 
moisture of the Currants and 
Herbs; throwing away the 
husks; as you eat it, sweeten it 
with a very little Sugar, Salt, 
Butter, and fine Manchet may 
be added, unless the Disease be 
very acute: Or, 
 
Take a quart of water, put 
to it a spoonful or two of Oatmeal, 
and a little Mace, when 
it is sufficiently boil'd, put in 
[^p.49^] 
it seven or eight spoonfuls of 
white, or Rhenish-wine, to 
make it more nourishing (if 
the Disease will bear it) beat 
up an Egg with a little Sugar, 
and put some of the hot liquour 
to it, and then give it a walm or 
two: Or, 
 
Take tamarinds or Pruens, 
wash them in several Waters, 
then stone them, and cut them 
small; boil them in a sufficient 
quantity of Water and 
Oatmeal, and strain the juyce 
from the flesh, as you did the 
Currants, and add to it a little 
Sugar when you eat it. 
 
All sorts of Broths, Ptisans, 
and Suppings made of Barley 
clean pick'd, hul'd, and wash'd 
in many waters, is very pleasing 
to persons sick of hot Diseases; 
So are all tart, sharp and 
sowre things, as Verjuyce, Barberries, 
Vinegar, Gooseberries, 
[^p.50^] 
Cervices, Oranges, Lemons, 
dryed Grapes, or our common 
red Cherries dryed, quench 
thirst, cool, cause appetite, and 
please most sick Pallats, Sorrel, 
is a most noble and useful 
plant; Possets made of it, are 
excellent in ardent or malignant 
Fevers, the Green-sauce 
made of it, is the best of all 
Sauces for Flesh, Gooseberries 
not full ripe, scalded, and eaten 
with good Water, a little Sugar 
and Rose-water, Marmalade of 
Gooseberries is also a dainty repast 
for weak and sickly persons, 
so is their Quideny, the 
Quideny of Currants, both 
white and red, do the like; so 
do Barberries either preserved, 
or in the conserve, and many 
such like dainties made by ingenuous 
Gentlewomen; Tamarind 
Possets are also very pleasing, 
and profitable in all 
[^p.51^] 
hot Diseases: 'Tis made thus: 
 
Take three pints, or two 
quarts of Milk, boil in it about 
two peny worth of Tamarinds 
(which you may buy at the 
Apothecaries) until it turn the 
Milk, then strain it from it 
Curds: Thus is made White-wine, 
Rhenish, Lemon, Orange, 
Sorrel, Pippin, and all Possets 
made of Sowre things, which 
are excellent in Fevers, and all 
Diseases coming of Choler; Vinegar 
Possets will do as well as 
any. 
 
Apples quodled, and eaten 
with Water, Sugar, and Verjuyce, 
are grateful to a hot and 
dry constitution: So Pruens 
stew'd with Sorrel, Verjuyce, 
or Juyce of Lemon, Endive, 
Succory, Dandelyon, Spinage, 
Beets, Purslain, Borrage, Bugloss, 
Violet, Strawberries, Cynqfoyl, 
Raspeberries, Mulberries 
[^p.52^] 
Burnet, Quince, Plantain, 
Dampsons, Lettice, Cucumbers, 
Eggs potch'd into Water, Vinegar 
or Verjuyce, and eaten 
with Sorrel sipits or Vinegar, and 
fine Sugar may be permitted 
persons, whose Disease is not 
acute, or Eggs beaten in a Platter 
with Butter-milk to a moderate 
thickness, and sugar'd is 
also excellent. 
 
Two-Milk Posset: that is, 
boil a quart of Milk, to this 
put a pint of Butter-milk, take 
off the Curd, and you have a 
pleasant Posset: This Bocheet 
made of Ivory is also excellent. 
 
Take Spring-water three 
pints, boil it away to two; 
when it is cold, put to it one 
ounce of shavings of Ivory, a 
few Coriander, or Carryway-Seeds; 
you may add also as many 
bruised Currants as Ivory, 
[^p.53^] 
put them all in a Tin Coffee-pot, 
adding as you think fit, a little 
liquorish, and let them stand 
simpering by the fire, four or 
five hours, then strain them, and 
keep the liquor in the pot to 
drink when you will as Coffee; 
to make it a more pleasant repast, 
you may put a little Rhenish-wine 
to it, and dulcifie it 
with a little powder of white 
Sugar candy. Cullis, and Jelly of 
Ivory and Harts-horn is a good 
Restorative Diet; for hot maciated 
persons, make it thus: 
 
Take a Chicken or young 
Cockerel, Pheasant, Snipe, or 
Wood cock; those that have 
not too much money, may take 
Hogs feet, Lambs, Calves, Pigs-pettitoes 
or Trotters; or take 
the bones of Veal, Mutton, 
Hens, Pullets, Capons, &c. 
which have sinews sticking to 
them; Boil all, or any of these 
[^p.54^] 
in the water wherein French 
Barley has first been boiled, 
throw away the Barley, and 
add to the Water some shavings 
of Ivory, and a few Currants, 
or estoned Raisins; when the 
broth is throughly boiled, strain 
it, and when it is cold it will 
Jelly; take from it when 'tis 
cold all the fat from the top, 
and dregs at the bottom; and to a 
Porenger of this melted, put 
the yolk of a new laid Egg 
beaten up with the Juyce of an 
Orange, and a little Sugar, and 
let it stew gently a little while, 
and so drink it. 
 
[}Note.}] 
 
That all salt, and bitter, and very 
sweet things; and all hot 
and dry things, are to be avoided 
while you use this diet, 
and are advised so to do by your 
[^p.55^] 
Physician, as Pepper, Ginger, 
Cynamon, much salt, Tobacco, 
Brandy, and wine unless mix'd 
with Water, strong Beer and 
Ale, and meat especially much 
rosted, and very fat: But 
cooling Odours, as Vinegar 
or Water, wherein Rose leaves, 
Violets, or any sweet temperate 
Herbs have been steep'd; or a 
turf of fresh earth often smelt 
to; or to receive much the 
sent of Cow-dung is good and 
necessary for hot blooded people. 
 
[^p.56^] 
[}CHAP. II. 
Treats of a Hot Diet, for Cold 
Diseases and Constitutions.}] 
 
THe intent of hot Aliments 
is to heat and dry a cold 
and moist Constitution; to 
cherish and restore our Native 
heat, when it is deficient, by 
any cold accident or disease. 
If Food vertually hot, exceed 
the second degree of heat; as 
Garlick, Onyons, Mustard, Radish, 
Brandy, &c. It may not 
then improperly be called Physick; 
and more fit to be used 
so, than as food; and though 
our bodies are best preserved 
by things con-natural, or moderately 
[^p.57^] 
hot; yet when we do 
accustom them to things immoderate, 
as much Wine, Brandy, 
Tobacco, &c. We seldom 
long escape death, or some great 
disease: But away with these 
distinctions of qualities, says 
Mempsis: All that concerns this 
Chapter, is to mind you of 
such things as are contrary to a 
cold disease, a faint, weak, vapid 
and watery blood: and 
'tis endless to assert all that may 
be said of this subject: I shall 
therefore only single out such 
as are sufficient. This Cullis is 
counted excellent. 
 
Take a large Cock, Capon, 
Sparrows. Partridge, Snipes or 
Wood-cocks, boil all, or any of 
them, in a gallon of Spring-water, 
till they fall in pieces, or 
come to a Pottle: then take off 
all the fat when 'tis cold, and 
[^p.58^] 
put to it two quarts of White-wine, 
and then boil it again to 
a Pottle: then clarifie it with 
two or three Whites of Eggs: 
then dulcifie and Aromatize 
it, with about a quarter of 
an ounce of Cinamon grosly 
beaten, and about four ounces 
more or less of fine Sugar: 
colour it with Saffron, and perfume 
it with a grain or two of 
Musk, or Amber-greese; and 
to make it more cordial and 
costly, add to in confect. of Alchermes, 
and Hyacynth, q. v. 
strain it through a gelly bag 
two or three times, and eat it 
alone, or mix it with other 
broths. Or, 
 
Take Calves feet, Cow-heel, 
fresh Pig-pork, Veal or Trotters, 
let them simper ten or 
twelve hours by a soft fire, in a 
sufficient quantity of Springwater, 
[^p.59^] 
with Mary-golds, Rosemary, 
Time, Savory, Sweet-marjoram, 
Mace, or Cinamon: 
when 'tis almost boil'd enough, 
add to it a crust of bread, then 
strain it: To make it more 
nourishing, put to it, as you 
eat it, the yolk of an Egg and 
Sugar. Or, 
 
Take a quart of Sack, burn it 
with Rosemary, Nutmegs or 
Mace, then temper two or three 
new laid Eggs, with four or five 
spoonfuls of it: Give it a walm 
or two with the Eggs, and add 
to it Sugar to your content: 
Thus also for cheapness it may 
be made with Ale, stale-beer or 
Sider: Or, 
 
Take two or three spoonfuls 
of Brandy, put to it a pint of 
Ale, boil the Ale and scum it, 
then put to it Sugar and drink 
it: Or, 
 
[^p.60^] 
Take three or four leaves of 
Sage; twelve leaves of Garden, 
or Sea-scurvy-grass, shavings of 
Horse-radish root, as much as 
will lye on a shilling, Raisins 
of the sun eston'd, Num. 20. 
put them into a quart bottle of 
Ale or Beer, after two or three 
days you may drink it constantly 
for your ordinary drink against 
the Scurvy, Dropsie, 
Green-sickness, or any cold 
Disease. 
 
Egg-caudle, and all sorts of 
broths, Bocheets, Caudles, Cullices, 
Jellies, and liquid Aliments, 
made with Flesh, Eggs, 
Sugar, Sweet-fruit, Wine, or 
Aromatick Spices, nourish more 
and sooner than things that are 
solid, and in the substance, 
and on this account, no diet 
can exceed Eggs eaten any ways. 
 
[^p.61^] 
Take any flesh reer-rosted or 
boil'd (Mutton is best) press 
from it the Juyce or Gravy: 
let it simper over a soft fire, 
with so much white or Rhenish 
Wine, as there is Gravy: 
to which add the yolk of Eggs 
as you see occasion, Sugar, and 
a little Cinamon, Nutmeg or 
Mace; drink often four or five 
spoonfuls of it, or eat it with 
crums of fine Manchet, or Naples 
Bisket: The bottom of any 
well-seasin'd Venison Pasty, 
or meat Pye stew'd in a sufficient 
quantity of Wine and 
Water, or Ale and Water, or 
Water only makes a good stomach 
Potage. 
 
All aromatick Plants, all exalted 
Sauces with Anchovaes, 
Saffron, Shalots, Pepper, Ginger, 
Cloves, Cinamon, Nutmeg, 
Mace, Mustard, or Horse-radish 
[^p.62^] 
roots, Chervil, Cresses, Mint, 
Peny-royal, Taragon, &c. 
Steept, slic'd or shred into Sack, 
are good Sauces for cold and 
crude stomachs. 
 
[}Note.}] 
 
That Ambrosiopæa's, or our Cordial 
Spirits, much Flesh, and 
good Wine moderately taken, 
may be used while you are under 
this diet: Rich aromatick 
scents, odours, and perfumes 
are also excellent: Galen 
counted them the solace 
and support of his life: The 
sauce and food of his Spirits; 
and that Reverend Divine, 
the learned Hooker, found 
them to fortifie nature, that 
he could not live without them: 
And certainly, most distempers 
incident to a cold and moist 
[^p.63^] 
brain (the original and prime 
cause of most diseases) are prevented, 
relieved or cured by 
Aromatick Odours: these and 
good Air, are says, ('tis Hippocrates, 
I think) the [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
charms against all 
evil. 
 
[^p.64^] 
[}CHAP. III. 
 
Treats of a moist diet for dry 
diseases and constitutions.}] 
 
MOst of those things mentioned 
in the first Chapter 
against hot diseases, may be 
useful also against dry, because 
such diseases as are hot, are generally 
also dry; and therefore 
it is, that moisture and dryness 
are counted passive qualities: 
But besides what are already 
mentioned in that Chapter, 
there's nothing can come in 
competition with Milk: and 
had Gods providence confined 
us only to this Aliment, and 
[^p.65^] 
bread we had no cause to complain 
of his bounty. 
 
'Tis generally suppos'd to be 
of a cold and moist temper; 
but being nothing else but 
white blood, I rather think it 
(as blood is) temperately hot 
and moist, and so like the blood 
of our bodies, that nothing can 
exceed it for nourishment, and 
therefore 'tis that Milk in acute 
distempers is accounted offensive, 
unless alaid with water: 
Asses Milk for Medicinal use is 
in greatest repute, because 'tis 
not so thick, to obstruct, nor 
so thin as not to nourish: both 
which may be performed by 
Cow-milk, either by taking 
from it the Cream, call'd Fleet-milk 
or putting to it a due proportion 
of Whey, especially if 
the Whey be first well boil'd, 
and put to it cold, and then it 
[^p.66^] 
will answer all the intents 
of Asses milk: But such as are 
sound, and under no manifest 
distemper, stand in no need of 
these cautions and directions, 
nor can err in eating it, only 
observing: 1. That they do 
not eat it raw and cold, when 
they are hot: 2. Not to eat it 
on a full stomach, or mingled 
with other meats: this makes 
children so subject to Worms: 
3. Use no violent motion immediately 
after it. - A draught 
of warm Milk from any Cow; 
('tis but conceit and opinion 
to count on a red-Cow, more 
than a red-Woman: the brown 
and black of both Kine are 
best, so that they are young, 
well fed, and well flesh'd) their 
Milk, I say, taken in bed about 
an hour before you rise, is an 
absolute refection for a hot, 
[^p.67^] 
lean and dry constitution, if you 
put a little Sugar, or Salt in it, 
you need not fear its curdling or 
corrupting. This trifle made 
of Milk is pleasant: Take a 
quart of Milk; boil in it a blade 
of Mace: then take it from the 
fire, and dissolve in it two or 
three spoonfuls of fine Sugar: 
then when 'tis blood-warm, put 
to it about a spoonful of Runnet, 
stir it, and dish it out for 
a wholesome repast: some do 
it with Cream instead of Milk, 
they are both good: There 
are many of the like nature, 
which this short Essay will not 
permit of. 
 
Fish of all sorts is also cold 
and moist, especially those that 
live in fresh waters, but Fish 
that dwell in salt waters, and 
among Rocks, and gravel Rivers 
are best. Fresh-cod, 
[^p.68^] 
Whiting, Shads, Place, Flounder, 
Sole, Bream, Barbel, Smelts, 
Carps, Gudgeon, Pearch, Pikes, 
Roche, Mullets, Jacks, or broths 
made with these, and Oysters, 
Cockles, crums of bread, and 
yolks of Eggs are fine feeding 
for sick maciated people. 
 
Fruit of all sorts, Pears, Apples, 
Prunes, &c. Stew'd, rosted, 
boil'd or bak'd, are good 
also against dry Diseases; Carrots 
Cowslips, Purslain, Letice, 
Asparagus, ripe Mulberries, Spinache, 
Strawberries, Dates, Violet 
leaves, Sweet-almonds, Mallows, 
Beets, Endive, Succory, 
Borage, Burnet, Liquorish, Scorzonera, 
Raisins, Currants, 
Whey, Wheat, French barley, 
Oatmeal Puddings, Frumety; 
but above all things Flumory, 
the worth of which is known 
[^p.69^] 
to few: 'tis made thus: Take 
half a peck of Oatmeal, take 
from it the superfine flowre, 
put it to soke three or four 
days in a stand, or any earthen 
Vessel, with so much water as 
will more than cover it, shift the 
water every day to take away 
the bitterness of the Oatmeal, 
let it stand in the last water till 
it sowre: and when you would 
use it, stir it well together, and 
strain so much as you would 
use at once: then boil it up to 
the consistence of a gelly, and 
eat it at any time cold or hot, 
with a little White-wine or Sugar, 
Sack, Claret, Sider or Oat-Ale; 
though it seems worst, 
that sort of Flumory is best 
which looks cleer and sheer, 
and tastes sharp and sowre: 
Thus also may be made Flumory 
of Wheat, Rice, French 
[^p.70^] 
barley, &c. Frogs and Snailes 
are counted good food in 
France, so may Toads, Spiders, 
or any Vermine, if they come 
from thence: Our English Hens, 
Cocks, Veal, Lamb, Chickens, 
Kid and Capons, are, I think, 
every whit as good for saline, 
hot and dry bodies: If your 
Lamb and Veal be very young, 
you ought to stick it with 
Cloves or Rosemary, as you 
do Beef; and it eats more 
pleasant, and is more wholesome. 
The brains of most Animals 
are over moist and 
Phlegmatick: But the Rumps, 
Tails and Tongues of all Beasts, 
(but one) are temperate and restorative. 
The Lungs also of 
Flesh and Fowl are good for 
hot and dry constitutions: So 
are the Eyes, Gizards, Sweet-breads, 
and feet of most creatures 
[^p.71^] 
especially boil'd. Cassia 
or Currants boil'd in Chicken 
or Veal-broth, cools, moistens, 
and loosneth the belly: This 
is also a good, cool, moist, 
cheap and nourishing potage: 
boil any Mutton or Veal in 
water, with or without Oatmeal; 
when the Meat is a little 
more than half boil'd, put in 
it a bundle of sweet Herbs, 
and the green leaves of Marygolds, 
Sorrel, Spinage, Lettice, 
purslain, Violet, and 
Strawberry leaves: add to 
these a sufficient quantity of the 
tender part of Asparagus, or a 
good quantity of green Pease 
will do as well, especially if 
you bruise some of them before 
you put them in: Or boil 
Damask Pruens in two quarts 
of water; after they have 
boil' a quarter of an hour, 
[^p.72^] 
put to them a saucer full of 
wheaten bran; let your bran 
only steep in the hot water 
till 'tis cold, then strain it, and 
sweeten it with Sugar, and 
drink it frequently: Or steep 
a pound of Pruens, and a very 
little Liquorish in three or 
four pints of cold water, thirty 
or forty hours, and drink it 
for common drink: Or this 
Emulsion: Take Raisins of the 
Sun ston'd, and Currants of 
each a small handful, Lettice 
and Purslain seed of each 
bruised two or three drachms, 
boil them in a Gallon of 
Spring water to a Pottle; then 
blanch two or three ounces of 
Almonds, and bray them in a 
stone Morter: strain the liquor, 
and put into it the Almonds; 
the strain it again, 
and with fine Sugar make an 
[^p.73^] 
Almond Milk, and drink it 
blood warm, as often as you 
will. In short, nothing moistens 
the body more than much 
sleep, ease and rest, and living 
in such a moist Air as Lambethmarsh, 
Hackney, or Dengy hundreds: 
And though that Air 
is simply best, which is most 
serene, clear, sharp and dry; 
Nay, our Native Air, though 
by its simpathy with our first 
matter, often times most repairs 
and mends our decayed 
Natures; yet sometimes a gross, 
thick and moist Air, or indeed 
any Air opposite to the 
Disease we labour under, must 
by us always be reputed best: 
it being a sure rule that all 
things cure best by contraries, 
be it Air, Aliments, Food, Physick, 
or any of the non-naturals. 
 
[^p.74^] 
[}Note.}] 
 
That while you are directed this 
Diet, all things are to be avoided, 
which are forbidden 
in the first Chapter. 
 
[^p.75^] 
[}CHAP. IV. 
 
Treats of a drying diet, for moist 
Diseases and Constitutions.}] 
 
BRead, is so inseparable a 
companion of life, that 
neither sound or sick can subsist 
without it; and did I not 
stand in awe of time, and 
feared prolixity: I would write 
its Paragraph, and make mankind 
sensible, how with this, 
Milk or Water, and very little 
else, we might contemn the 
curiosities of a Court, and encounter 
with death it self. Epicurus 
(that Cormorant and 
Monster of men) only with his 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] could entertain 
himself so well; that he could 
dispute felicity with Kings: 
[^p.76^] 
and in his morals tells us, that 
when he would entertain himself 
more splendidly, he mended 
his chear with a little Milk, 
and found so much satisfaction 
by it, that he bids defiance to 
the pleasures, which the ignorant 
and sensual world so much 
like, and cry up in magnificent 
feasts, great entertainments, 
rich Wines, costly Meats and 
Junkets: and certainly says our 
wise man, most that have addicted 
themselves to variety, 
extravagancy and excess, have 
thereby either loaded themselves 
with new cares, or contracted 
new vices; and so become 
obnoxious to various and 
great troubles, and frequently 
commit Rapines, Cheats, violating 
Justice, Faith, and Friendship, 
and many times precipitate 
themselves into grievous 
[^p.77^] 
Diseases, losses and disparagements; 
which by Frugality, 
Temperance and Sobriety they 
might have avoided: Nature 
requires little, opinion much, 
and he that has not this faculty 
of abdicating from his desires, 
his mind is like a Vessel full of 
holes ever filling, but never 
full; and to him, that is not satisfied 
with a little, nothing 
will ever be enough: and whosoever 
covets no more, than 
that little he enjoys; however 
the world (deceived by vain opinion) 
may account him poor, 
yet he really is the richest man 
alive; and the way to make 
ones self truly great and rich, 
is not by adding to ones riches, 
but by detracting from our desires; 
and what reason is there, 
then says our brave Philosopher, 
that any man should stand 
[^p.78^] 
in fear of Fortune, or court 
it's favour, since few or none 
are so poor, as to want long 
these things, or ever was reduced 
to a lower ebb, than 
Sallets, Bread and Water; nor 
know I, whether more than 
this, with a quiet mind, and 
good appetite (without which 
none need eat) is worth contending 
for. How many by 
high drinks and dyet, riot, and 
luxurious compotations have 
dyed on their Close-stools, expired 
in privies, and took their 
leaves of this base world over 
a Chamber-pot, or at least, only 
out-liv'd the conflict, with 
Gouts, Palsies, Catarrhs, Surfeits, 
and many other ignominious 
Diseases: and what great 
matter can be expected in 
Church or State, from that 
man whose joynts are infeebled, 
[^p.79^] 
his sinews relaxed, his head 
clowded, eyes bleered, and 
mouth full of curses and clamours, 
and all by reason of 
debauchery, excess and luxury; 
which chokes rather than 
cherisheth Nature, and clogs 
the Veins and Vessels with such 
superfluous moisture, that no 
Meats nor Medicines can command 
those unmanly Diseases, 
that are the effects of it: and 
though Bread will do as much 
as any thing, yet, unless temperance, 
abstinence, or a spare 
diet be joyned with it, all 
that Physick or Food can do 
is in vain. No persons are 
more offended with Crudities, 
Worms, Fluxes, and Defluxions 
than those that eat none, 
or too little Bread: No Flesh, 
Fish or Fruits that we can feed 
on, but putrifie and convert 
[^p.80^] 
to slime and water for want of 
it: No country, no place, no 
people; (in some sort or other) 
are without it: Some 
bake it, some broil it; others 
fry, tost and boil it; some 
make it of dry'd Fish, some with 
roots of Plants, and Barks of 
Trees: some with Seeds, Nuts 
Acorns: Among our selves 'tis 
made of Barley, Rye, Oats, 
Misceline, Wheat; of all which 
Barley Bread is worst, and 
Wheaten best, especially if it 
be not too fine, and without 
leven, or spoil'd in making or 
baking: The crum is best for 
Cholerick, the crust for Phlegmatick 
and moist constitutions; 
or they may eat it tosted: the 
newer it is, the more it nourisheth; 
the older it is, the 
more it drys: I have known 
Children cured of the Chin-cough 
[^p.81^] 
by drinking little, and 
eating much Bread; 'tis good 
also against the Rickets: and 
the reason why Fluxes, Surfeits, 
Fevers and many other 
Diseases, are so rife in Fruit-time, 
is, because Bread is not 
eaten with them: the more 
moist and liquid our meats are, 
the more Bread is to be eaten 
with them: dry houshold 
Bread, Manchet or Bisket, eaten 
for a Breakfast, for Supper 
or last at meals, with a little 
Wine, is the only refuge for 
Rheumatick and moist constitutions. 
Galen, by much study, 
was troubled with distillations, 
but preserved himself 
many years by eating no other 
Breakfast or Supper, than Bread 
dipt in Wine, and with good 
Odours. Rice made into Bread, 
or dry'd in an Oven, and steep'd 
[^p.82^] 
in Wine or stale strong Beer, 
and the boil'd or bak'd with 
a little Pepper, Seeds, or Cinamon 
is good, so are all spiced, 
and Aromatick Aliments: Eggs 
rosted and eaten with Pepper, 
much Salt or Cinamon, and a 
glass of Wine or good Drink. 
after them, nourish and dry 
much: All Wild Fowl, Partridge, 
old Pigeons, Ducks 
and Geese; Stares, Trushes 
and Black-birds; Larks, Sparrows, 
Teel and Widgeon, 
Rabbets, Beef, Mutton, Venison 
and Hare dry rosted, dry 
up Rheum: Broth made with 
Rabbets, Rice, Sorrel, Sage, 
Sparrows, &c. All sowre things 
also dry much, as Vinegar, Verjuyce, 
Orange, Lemon: Allum 
posset is incomparable for a 
gargel to hinder defluxions, 
or take it inwardly in hot 
[^p.83^] 
and moist distempers: Make it 
thus: Take a lump of Roch-Allum, 
put it into a quart or 
two of boiling Milk, stir it till 
it is very well curdled; take 
off the curd, and drink it hot, 
in malignant and putrid Fevers: 
Broths made of China 
and Sarsa; or let all your Beer 
and Wine be drank out of a 
Lignum Vitæ cup: Some have 
abstain'd from all manner of 
drink, for many months: there 
are many other things that 
might be added to dry a moist 
Disease and Constitution, 
which we omit, because most 
of the Diet in the second 
Chapter against cold Diseases, 
may be used here as a drying 
Diet. 
 
[^p.84^] 
[}Note.}] 
 
That our Ambrofiopææs, or 
Cordial Spirits, at, after, 
or before meats may be 
used, while you are under 
this diet: But Milk, 
much Sugar, Much Drink, 
and all moist things, 
mentioned in the third 
Chapter must be omitted; 
But Abstinence, a spare 
diet; much excercise, little 
sleep, especially in the 
day-time, and presently 
after feeding is pernicious, 
for fat, Phlegmatick, 
and moist bodies; 
[^p.85^] 
for hot, lean and dry 
bodies 'tis necessary, especially 
in Summer and hot Seasons. 
 
[}The Conclusion.}] 
 
And the summ of all is 
this: when a Pauper and 
sick person comes to me; I 
direct him (if any) no more 
Physick that is absolutely 
necessary; next I bid 
him keep a proper diet, or 
take a proper Cordial against 
his Disease. If his 
Disease comes from a hot 
cause, I bid him keep (till 
[^p.86^] 
he recovers) to the Medicines 
and diet belonging 
to the first Chapter. If 
from a cold cause, then to 
use no other Diet and Medicines 
than is contained 
in the second Chapter. If 
from a moist or dry cause, 
then to the Diet, and Directions 
in the third and 
fourth Chapter. If Diet 
and our Cordial Drinks 
do not do, then I recommend 
them to the Stove 
and Artificial Bath, mentioned 
in the second part 
of these Dialogues; and 
if then, and there they 
mend not, you may conclude 
[^p.87^] 
their case desperate 
and more fit for the Divine 
than Physician.
