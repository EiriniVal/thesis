[^f.A2r^] 
[}The fyrste chapter dothe shewe where a 
man shulde buylde or set his howse or 
place for the helth of his body.}] 
 
A Man of honoure, 
or worshyp, or other estate, 
the whiche dothe pretende, 
to buylde a howse or any 
mansyon place, to inhabyte 
hym selfe: Or els doth pretende to alter 
his howse, or to alter olde buyldynge in to 
co~modyous and pleasaunt buyldyng, not 
onely for his owne proper co~modyte, welth 
and helth, But also for other men, the whiche 
wyll resorte to hym, hauynge also a respect 
to his posteryte. Fyrste it is necessary 
and expedyent for hym to take hede what 
counseyll god dyd gyue to Abraham, and 
after that to take hede what counsell God 
dyd gyue to Moyses, and to his chyldren 
of Israell, as it apereth in the .xiii. chapter 
of Exodi And the .xx chapter of Numeri. 
And the .vi. chapter of Deutronomii. And 
also in the Boke of Leuites, sayeng fyrst to 
Abraham. Go thou forth of thy countre, & 
[^f.A2v^] 
from thy cognacion or kynred, and come 
thou in to y=e= countre, the which I wyl shewe 
to the a countre, abundyng & plentyful of 
mylke & ho~ny. Here is to be noted that 
where there is plentye of mylke, there is 
plentye of pasture, and no skarsyte of water. 
And where there is plentye of ho~ny, there 
is no skarsyte, but plentyfulnes of woddes. 
For there be moo bees in woddes, and 
so consequently abundau~ce of ho~ny, than 
there be bees or ho~ny, or waxe in the hyues 
in gardynes, or orchardes. Wherfore it apereth 
that who soeuer that wyl buylde a ma~syon 
place or howse, he must cytuat and set 
it there where he must be sure to haue both 
water and wod, except for pleasure, he wyl 
byulde a howse in or by some cytie or great 
towne, the whiche be not destytude of such 
co~modyties. But he the whiche wyll dwell 
at pleasure, and for profyte and helthe of 
his body, he must dwell at elbowe rome hauynge 
water and wod anexed to his place 
or howse. For yf he be destytuted of any of 
the pryncipalles, that is to saye, fyrste of 
water for to wasshe and to wrynge, to bake 
[^f.A3r^] 
and to brewe, and dyuers other cause specially 
for peryll the which myght fall by fyre 
it were a great disco~modyous thynge. And 
better it were to lacke wodde, than to lacke 
water, y=e= premysses co~syderyd althoughe 
that wod is a necessary thynge not onely 
for fewell, but also for other vrgent causes 
specyallye co~sernynge buyldynge and reperacyons. 
 
[}The seconde chapter doth shewe a man, 
howe he shulde buylde his howse or 
Mansyon, that the prospecte be 
fayre and good for the conseruacion 
of helthe.}] 
 
AFter that a man haue 
chosen a conuenyent soyle 
and place accordynge to his 
mynde and purpose to buylde 
the howse or mansyon on. 
He must haue afore cast in his mynde, that 
the prospecte to and fro the place, be pleasaunt, 
fayre, and good to the iye, to behold 
the woddes, the waters, the feldes, the vales 
[^f.A3v^] 
the hylles, & the playne grounde. And that 
euery thynge be desent and fayre to the iye 
not onely within the precynct of the place 
apoynted to buylde a mansyon or a howse 
to the co~modyties about it, but also it may 
be placable to the iyes of of all men to se and 
to beholde whan they be a good dystaunce 
of from the place, that it doth stande co~modyously. 
For the co~modyous buyldynge of 
a place doth not onely satysfye the mynde 
of the inhabytour, but also it doth co~forte 
and reioyseth a mannes harte to se it, specyally 
the pulcruse prospecte. For my conceyte is 
such that I had rather not to buylde 
a mansyon or a howse, than to buylde 
one without a good p~specte i~ it to it, & from 
it. For & the iye be not satysfyed, the mynde 
can not be co~tentyd And the mynde can 
not be contentyd, the harte can not be pleased, 
yf the herte and mynde be not pleased 
nature doth abhorre. And yf nature 
do abhorre, mortyfycacion of the 
vytall and anymall and spyrytuall 
powers do consequently 
folowe. 
 
[^f.A4r^] 
[}The thyrde chapter doth shewe a man to 
buylde his howse in a pure and a 
freshe ayre, to lenght his lyfe.}] 
 
THere is noo thynge excepte 
poyson that doth putryfye 
or doth corrupt the blode of 
man. And also doth mortyfye 
the spyrytes of man, as 
dothe a corrupte and a contagyous ayer. 
For Galyen terapeutice nono sayth, whether 
we wyl or wyl not, we must graunt to 
euery man ayer, for without the ayer no 
man can lyue. The ayer can not be to clene 
and pure consyderyng it doth close & doth 
compasse vs rounde aboute, and we do receyue 
it in to vs, we can not be without it, 
for we lyue by it, as the fysshe lyueth by the 
water. Good ayer therfore is to be praysed 
For yf the ayer be fryske pure and clene aboute 
the mansyon or howse, it doth conserue 
the lyfe of man it doth co~forte the brayne 
and the powers naturall & ingendryng 
and makynge good blode, in the whiche co~systyth 
the lyfe of man. And contraryly euyll 
[^f.A4v^] 
and corrupt ayers doth infecte the blode, 
and dothe ingendre many corrupte humours, 
and doth putryfye the brayne and 
doth corrupt the harte, & therfore it doth brede 
many deseases, & infyrmities thorough 
the whiche mannes lyfe is abreuyated and 
shortenyd. Many thynges doth infecte putryfy 
and corruptyth the ayer, the fyrste is 
the influence of sondy sterres, and standynge 
water stynkynge mystes and caryn lyenge 
longe aboute the grounde, moche people 
in a small rome lyeng vnclenly and beynge 
fylthe and sluttysh. Wherfore he that 
dothe pretende to buylde his mansyon or 
howse, he must prouyde that he do not cytuat 
his howse nygh to any marshe or morysshe 
grou~de. And that there be not nygh 
to the place stynkynge and puterfyed sta~dyng 
water pooles, nor morysh, but at lestwyse, 
that suche waters do stande vpon a 
stony or a grauell grounde myxt with clay 
and that some freshe spryng haue a recourse 
to noryshe and to refreshe the sayd standynge 
waters. Also there must be circu~spection 
had that there be not aboute the howse 
[^f.B1r^] 
or mansyon stynkyng dyches, gutters nor 
canelles nor corrupt dunghylles, nor synckes 
excepte they be oft dyuers tymes mundyfyed, 
and made clene: Swepyng of howses 
and chambres ought not to be done, as 
longe as any honest man is within the precyncte 
of the howse, for the douste doth putryfye 
the ayer makynge it musty & dence. 
Also nyghe to the place, let nother hempe 
nor flexe be wateryd, and beware of the 
snoffe of candelles, and of the sauoure of 
apples, for these thynges be contagyous, 
and infectyue. Also mystye & clowdy dayes 
impetous and vehement wyndes, troubelous 
and vaperous wether is not good 
to laboure in it to open the poores to let in 
infectious ayer. Furthermore beware of 
pyssyng in drauftes, and permyt no co~mon 
pyssynge place be aboute the howse or ma~syon, 
and let the co~mon howse of esement 
be ouer some water, or els elongatyd from 
the howse. And beware of emptyeng of pyspottes 
and pyssyng in chymnes, so that all 
euyll and contagyous ayers may be expellyd, 
and clere ayer kept vnputryfyed. And 
[^f.B1v^] 
of all thynges let the buttery, the celler, the 
kytchyn, the larderhowse with al other howses 
of offyces be kepte clene, that there be 
no fylth in them, but good and odyferous 
sauours. And to expel and expulse all corrupt 
and contagyous ayer. 
 
For whan the plaages of the Pestylence 
or the swetynge syckenes is in a trowne or 
countre, at Mountpylour, and in all other 
hyghe regyons and countres, that I have 
ben in, the people doth flye from the contagyous 
and infectyous ayer, preseruatyues 
with other councell of Physycke, notwithstandynge. 
In lower and other baase countres, 
howses the whiche be infectyd in towne 
or cytie, be closed vp, both dores & wyndowes, 
and the inhabytours shal not come 
abrode, nother to churche nor market, for infectynge 
other, with that syckenes. 
 
[}The fourth chapter, doth shewe vnder 
what maner and fasshyon a man shulde 
buylde his howse and mansyon. 
in exchewynge thynges the 
whiche shulde shorten the 
lyfe of man.}] 
 
[^f.B2r^] 
WHan a man dothe begyn 
to buylde his howse or 
mansyon place, he muste 
prouyde (sayth Jhesus 
christe) before that he begynne 
to buylde, for all 
thynges necessarye, for 
the performacion of it, leste that whan he 
hah made his foundacion, and can not fynysshe 
his worke that he hath begon, euery 
man wyll deryde hym sayenge. This man 
dyd begyn to bylde, but he can not fynyssh 
or make an ende of his purpose, for a man 
must consyder the expence before he do begyn 
to buylde, for there goth to buyldynge 
many a nayle, many pynnes, many lathes 
and many tyles or sklates, or strawes, besyde 
other greatter charges, as tymber, bowdes, 
lyme, sande, stones or brycke, besyde 
workemanshyp, and the impleme~tes. But 
a man the whiche haue prouyde, or hath in 
store to accomplysse his purpose, And hath 
chosen a good soyle and place to cituat his 
howse or mansyon, and that the prospecte 
be good. And that the ayer be pure fresshe 
[^f.B2v^] 
and clene. Then he that wyll buylde, lette 
hym make his foundacion vpon a grauell 
grounde myxt with clay, or els let hym buylde 
vpon a rocke of stone, or els vpon an 
hyll or a hylles syde. And ordre and edyfy 
the howse so that the pryncipall and chefe 
prospectes may be Easte and West specially 
Northest, Southest, and Southwest, for 
the merydyall wynde of all wyndes is the 
most worst, for the South wynde doth corrupte, 
and doth make euyll vapours. The 
Est wynde is temperat fryske and fragra~t 
The West wynde is mutable. The North 
wynde purgeth euyl vapours, wherfore better 
it is of the two worst that y=e= wyndowes 
do open playne north, than playne south, 
although that Ieremy sayth from y=e= north 
dependyth all euyl And also it is wrytten 
in Cantica ca~ticorum. Ryse vp north wynde, 
and come thou south wynde and perflat 
my gardyn, make the hall vnder such a fasshyon, 
that the parloure anexed to the hed 
of the hall. And the buttery and pantry be 
at the howse ende of the hall, the seller vnder 
the pantry, set somwhat abase, the kytchyn 
[^f.B3r^] 
set abase from the buttry and pantry 
co~mynge with an entrye by the wall of the 
buttry, the pastry howse, & the larder howse 
anxed to the kytchyn, than deuyde the lodgynges 
by the cyrcuyte of the quadryuyall courte, 
and let the gate howse be opposyte 
or agaynst the hall dore standynge abase, 
& the gate house in the mydle of the fronte 
entrynge into the place, let the pryue chamber 
be anexed to the great chamber of estate 
with other chambers necessarye for the 
byldynge, so that many of the chambers 
may haue a prospecte in to the Chapell, yf 
there be an vtter courte made make it quadryuyall 
with howses of casme~tes, but one 
stable for horses of pleasure, use no fylthe 
nor dunge be within the courte, nor cast at 
the backesyde, but the dunge to be caryed 
far from the mansion. Also the stables and 
the slauter howse a dyapery yf any be kept 
shulde be elongatyd the space of a quarter 
of a myle from the place. And also the bake 
howse & brewe howse shuld be a dystance 
from the place and from other byldynge. 
Whan all the mansyon is edyfyed and bylt 
[^f.B3v^] 
there be a moote made aboute it, there shulde 
some fresshe sprynge come to it, and dyuers 
tymes the moote ought to be skowryd 
and kept clene from mud and wedes. And 
in no wyse let not to the fylth of the kytchyn 
descende in to the mote. Furthermore it is 
a co~modyous and a pleasaunt thyng to a 
mansyon to haue an orecherde of sondrye 
fruytes, but it is more co~modyous to haue 
a fayre gardyn repleatyd with herbes of aromatyke 
and redole~t sauoures, in the gardyn 
maye be a poole or two for fysshe, yf 
the pooles be clene kept. Also a parke repletyd 
with dere and conys, is a necessary and 
a pleasaunt thynge to be anexed to a mansyon. 
A doue howse also is a necessary thinge 
aboute a mansyon place. And amonge 
other thynges a parer of buttes is a decent 
thynge aboute a mansyon, and other whyse 
for a great ma~ necessary it is to passe his 
tyme with bowles in an aly, whan all this 
is fynysshed, and the ma~syon replenysshed 
with impleme~tes, there must be a fyre kept 
contynually for a space to dry the contagyous 
moystnes of the walles & the sauoure 
[^f.B4r^] 
of the lyme & sande And after that a man 
may lye and dwell in the sayde mansyon, 
without takynge any maner inconuenyence 
of syckenes. 
 
[}The .v. chapter doth shewe howe a man 
shulde ordre his howse consernynge 
the implementes to comforte the 
spyrytes of man.}] 
 
WHan a man hath bylt 
his ma~syon, and hath 
his howses necessarye 
aboute his place, yf 
he haue not howshold 
stuffe, or impleme~tes, 
the whiche be nedefull, but must borow of 
his neyghbours, he than is put to a shyfte, 
and to a great afterdele, for these men the 
whiche doo brewe in a botell and bake in a 
walet, it wyll be longe or he can ley Iacke 
and salet. yet euery thynge must haue a begynnyng, 
and euery man must do after his 
possessions or abylyte, this notwithstandynge 
better it is not to set vp a howseholde 
[^f.B4v^] 
or hospytalyte, then to set vp howsholde 
lackynge the performacion of it, as nowe 
to ronne for maler, and by & by, for salte, 
nowe to sende for breade, and by and by to 
sende for a shepes hed, & nowe to sende for 
this, and nowe to sende for that, and by & 
by he doth sende, he can not tel for what suche 
thynges is noo prouysion, but it is a 
great abusyon. Thus a man shall lose his 
thryfte. And be put to a shyft, his gooddes 
shall neuer increase, and he shall not be in 
rest nor peace, but euer in a carke & care. For 
his purse wyll euer be bare. Wherfore I do 
counceyll euery man, to prouyde for hym 
selfe, as soone as he can. For yf of implementes 
he be destytuted, men wyl call hym 
lyght wytted. To set vp a howse, & is not 
able to kepe man nor mowse. Wherfore let 
euery ma~ loke or he lepe. For many cornes 
maketh a great hepe. 
 
[}The .vi. chapter, doth shewe howe a 
man shulde order his howse, and 
howsholde. And also therin 
to lyue quyetly.}] 
 
[^f.C1r^] 
WHo so euer he be that wyl 
kepe an howse, he muste 
ordre the expenses of his 
howse accordi~g to y=e= rent 
of his landes. And yf he 
haue no landes, he must 
ordre his howse after his 
lucre wynnynge, or gaynes. For he that 
wyll spende more i~ his howse, than the rent 
of his landes, or his gaynes doth attayne 
to, he shall fall in to pouerte, and necessyte 
wyll vrge cause and compell hym, to sell 
his lande or to waste his stocke, as it is dayly 
sene by experyence of many men, wherfore 
they the which wyll exchewe suche prodygalyte, 
and inconuenience, must deuyde 
his rentes porcyon and expences, wherby 
he dothe lyue in to thre equall porcions or 
partes. The fyrste parte must serue to prouyde 
for meate & drinke, and al other necessary 
thyngs for the sustentacion of the howseholde. 
The seconde porcion or parte must 
be reseruyd for aparell not onely for a ma~nes 
owne selfe, but for all his howsholde, 
and for seruauntes wages deductyng some 
[^f.C1v^] 
what of this porcion i~ almesse dede to pore 
neyghbours, and pore people fulfyllynge 
other of the .vii. workes of mercy. The thyrde 
porcion or parte must be reseruyd for vrgent 
causes in tyme of nede as in syckenes 
reparacion of howses, with many other cotidyall 
expences besyde rewardes & the charges 
of a mans laste ende, yf a man do exsyde 
this ordre he may soone fall in dette, 
the whiche is a daungerous thynge many 
wayes besyde the bryngyng a man to troble. 
And he that is ones behynde & in trouble, 
he can not be in quyetnes of mynde, 
the whiche dothe perturbe the herte, and so 
consequently doth shorten a mannes lyfe. 
Wherfore there is noo wyse man, but wyll 
exchewe this inconuenyence. And wyll cast 
before what shall folowe after. And in no 
wyse to set vp a howsholde before he hathe 
made prouysion to kepe a howse. For yf a 
man shall bye euery thynge that belongeth 
to the kepynge of a howse with his peny, 
it will be longe or he be ryche, and longe 
or he can kepe a good house. But he is 
wyse in any conceyte y=t= wyll haue or he set 
[^f.C2r^] 
vp his howsholde .ii. or .iii. yeres rent in his 
cofer. And yf he haue no landes, then he 
muste prouyde for necessary thyngs or that 
he begyn howsholde, lest he repent hym self 
after, throughe the whiche he do fall in to 
pensyfulnes, and after that in to syckenes 
and dyseases, lyuynge not quyetly wherby 
he shall abreuyat his lyfe. 
 
[}The .vii. Chapter doth shewe howe the 
heed of a howse, or a howsholder, shuld 
exercyse hymselfe, for the health 
of his soule and body.}] 
 
AFter that a man hath prouyded 
all thynges necessarye 
for his howse, and for 
his howsholde: expedient it 
is for hym to knowe howe 
he shuld exercyse hymself both bodely 
and ghostly. For there is no catholike or christe 
man lyuyng, but he is bounde in co~science 
to be more circumspecter aboute the welth 
of his soule, than the health of his bodye. 
Our sauyoure Iesus Christe sayth: What 
[^f.C2v^] 
shall it profyte to man yf he get al the worlde, 
and lose hymselfe, and bryng hymselfe 
to a detryment. Wherfore it appeareth that 
a man ought to be circumspect for the helth 
and welth of his soule, for he is bou~de so to 
lyue that nyght & daye and at all houres 
he shuld be redy, than whan he is called for 
to departe out of this worlde he shulde not 
fere to dye, sayenge these wordes with S. 
Ambrose, I fere not to dye, for we haue a 
good God. Whan a man hath prepared for 
his soule and hath subdued sensualyte, and 
that he hath brought hymselfe in a trade or 
an vsage of a ghostly or catholyke lyuyng 
in obseruyng the co~maundementes of god. 
Than he muste studye to rule and gouerne 
them the whiche be in his howsholde or vnder 
his custody or dominion, to se that they 
be not ydle. For kyng Henry the .viii. sayd 
whan he was yonge. Idlenes is cheife maystres 
of vyces all. And also the heed of an 
howse must ouerse, that they the whiche be 
vnder his tuission serue god the holy dayes 
as dylygentlye se, and more dylygentlyer, 
than to do theyr worke, the feryall dayes refraynyng 
[^f.C3r^] 
them from vyce and synne, compellyng 
them to obserue the co~maundementes 
of God, specyally to punyshe swerers, 
for in al the world there is not such odeable 
sweryng as is vsed in Englande, specially 
amonges youthe and chyldren, whiche is a 
detestable thynge to here, and no man doth 
go aboute to punyshe it. Suche thynges reformed, 
than maye an howsholder be glad, 
not ceasyng to instruct them the whiche be 
ygnoraunt, but also he muste contynue in 
shewynge good example of lyuynge, than 
may he reioyce in God & be mery, the whiche 
myrth and reioysyng doth length a ma~nes 
lyfe, and doth expell syckenes. 
 
[}The .viii. Chapter doth shewe howe 
a man shuld ordre hymselfe in slepynge, 
and watche, and in werynge 
of his apparayll.}] 
 
WHan a man hath well exercysed 
hymselfe in the daytyme 
as is rehersed, he maye slepe 
soundly & surely in god, what 
[^f.C3v^] 
chaunce soeuer fortune in the nyght. Moderate 
slepe is most praysed, for it doth make 
perfyte dygestion. It doth noryshe the blod 
and doth qualyfy the heate of the lyuer. It 
doth acuat, quycken and refreshe, the memorye. 
It doth restore nature, & doth quiet 
all the humours & pulses in man, 
and doth anymat and comforte all the naturall, animall, 
and spyrytuall powers of man. And 
such moderat slepe is acceptable i~ the syght 
of God, the premises in the aforesayd chapter 
obserued and kept. And contraryly, immoderat 
slepe and sluggyshnes doth humiate 
and make lyght the brayne, it doth engendre 
rewme and Impostumes, it is euyl 
for the palsy, whether it be vniuersal or pertyculer, 
It is euyl for the fallyng sycknes 
called Epilencia, Analencia, and Cathalencia, 
Appoplesia, Soda. With all other 
infyrmytes in the heed, for it enduseth oblyuyousnes, 
for it doth obfuske and doth obnebulat 
the memorie and the quyckenes of 
wyt. And shortely to conclude it doth perturbe 
the naturall, anymall and spyrytuall, 
powers of man, and specially it doth instygat 
[^f.C4r^] 
and lede a man to syn~e, and doth induce 
and infarre breuyte of lyfe & detestably 
it dyspleaseth God. Our Lorde Iesu 
Christe dyd not onely byd his dysciples to 
watche, but dyd animat them and all other 
so to do, sayenge. (I say not onely to you 
watche) but to all men I say watche. And 
to Peter he sayd mightest not thou one houre 
watche with me. Althoughe these holye 
scriptures with many other mo, the whiche 
I myght allygat for me, although they be 
not greatly refarred to this se~ce, yet it may 
stonde here with my purpose & matter without 
reprehension. These matters here nede 
not greatly to be rehersed. Wherfore I do returne 
to my purpose, and say that the moderacion 
of slepe, shuld be mesured according 
to the naturall complexion of man, and in 
any wyse to haue a respect to the strenght 
and debelytie to age & youth, and to syckenes 
& health of man. Fyrst as consernyng 
the naturall helth of man. Sanguyne and 
colorycke men .vii. houres of slepe is sufficient 
for them. And nowe consyderyng the 
imbecilite and wekemes of nature: a flumaticke 
[^f.C4v^] 
man may slepe .ix. houres or more: melancoly 
men may take theyr pleasure, for 
they be the receptacle and the dredges of al 
the other humours. Secondly youth & age 
wolde haue temperau~ce in slepyng. Thyrdely 
strength may suffre a bront i~ watche the 
which debelyte and wekenes may not. As 
I wyl shewe by a famylyer exa~ple. There 
was two me~ sat at the dyce togyther a day 
and a nyght, and more, the weke man sayd 
to hym, I can playe no longer, the stronge 
man sayd to him, fye on the bench whystler 
wylt thou start away now, the weke man to 
satysfy the stronge mans mynde, appetyte 
and desyre playeth with his felow through 
the whiche he doth kyll hymself, the strong 
man doth hymself lytel pleasure, althyng 
consydred the whiche I do passe ouer. Wherfore 
I wyl returne to the sycke man, which 
may slepe at all tymes, whan he may get it 
but yf he may slepe at any tyme, best it is 
for hym to refrayne from slepe in the day & 
to take his natural rest and slepe in y=e= night 
and to eschew merydyall slepe, but yf nede 
shall compel a man to slepe after his meat, 
[^f.D1r^] 
let hym make a pause, & than let him stand 
and leane agaynst a cupborde and slepe, or 
els let hym syt vpright in a chayre & slepe: 
slepynge after a full stomacke doth ingendre 
dyuers infyrmyties. It doth hurte the 
splen, it relaxith the synewes, it doth ingendre 
the dropses and the gowte, & doth make 
a man loke euyll colored. Beware of venerious 
actes before the fyrst slepe, and specially 
beware of suche thynges after dyner, 
or after a full stomacke, for it doth ingendre 
the crampe and the gowte and other displeasures. 
To bedward be you mery, or haue 
mery co~pany about you, so that to bedward 
no anger nor heuines, sorow nor pencifulnes 
do troble or dysquiet you. To bedward 
and also in the mornyng vse to have 
a fyre in your chambre to waste and consume 
the euyll vapoures within the the chambre: 
for the breth of man may putryfy the ayre 
within the chambre: I do aduertise you not 
to stande nor to syt by the fyre, but stande 
or syt a good way of from the fyre, takyng 
the flamour of it, for fyre doth arysye and 
drye vp a mans blod, and doth make sterk 
[^f.D1v^] 
the synewes and Ioyntes of man. In the 
nyght let the wyndowes of your howse specially 
of your chambre be closed. Whan ye 
be in your bed, lye a litell whyle on youre 
left syde, and slepe on your ryght syde, 
and whan you do wake of your fyrst slepe make 
water yf ye fele your bladder charged, & 
than slepe on the left syde, and loke as ofte 
as as you do wake, so oft turne your self i~ the 
bed from one syde to another. To slepe grouelyng 
vpon the stomacke and bely, is not 
good, vnless the stomacke be slowe & tarde 
of digestion, but better it is to lay your hande 
or your bedfelowes hande ouer your stomacke 
than to lye grouelyng. To slepe on 
the backe vpright is vtterly to be abhorred 
whan that you do slepe let not your necke, 
nother your shulders, nother your handes, 
nor fete, nor no other place of the body lye 
bare vndyscouered. Slepe not with an emptye 
stomake, nor slepe not after that you 
haue eaten meate an houre or .ii. after. In 
your bed lye with your heed somwhat hygh 
lest that y=e= meate which is in your stomacke 
thorowe eructuacions or some other cause, 
[^f.D2r^] 
ascende to the orife of the stomack, let your 
nyght cap be of skarlet, and this I do aduertyse 
you, cause to be made a good thycke 
quylte of Cotton or els of pure flockes, 
or of clene wolle, and let the coueryng of it 
be of whyte fustian, and lay it on the fether 
bed that you do lye on, and in your bed lye 
not to hote nor to colde but in temperau~ce. 
Olde auncient doctors of Phisycke sayth 
.viii. houres of slepe in so~mer: and .ix. houres 
in wynter is suffycient for any man, but I 
do thynke that slepe oughte to be taken, as 
the complexion of man is. Whan you aryse 
in the mornyng, ryse with myrth, and reme~bre 
God. Let your hosen be brusshed within 
and without: and flauer the insyde of them 
against the fyre. Vse lynyn sockes or lynyn 
hosen nexte your legges. Whan you be out 
of your bed stretche forth your legges and 
armes and your bodye, coughe, & spyt, and 
than go to your stole of egestyon, and exonerate 
your selfe at all tymes that nature 
wold expell, for yf you do make any restriction 
in keping your egestion or your vryne 
or ventosyte, it may put you to displeasure 
[^f.D2v^] 
in bredynge of dyuers infyrmyties. After 
you have vacuated your body, and trussed 
your poyntes, kayme your heed oft, and so 
do dyuers tymes in the daye. And wasshe 
youre handes and wrestes, youre face and 
eyes, and youre teth, with colde water, and 
after that you be apparaylled, walke in to 
your gardayne or in to your Parke a thousande 
paace or two. And then great and 
noble men doth vse to here the Communyon. 
And other men that can not do so, but 
must apply there busynes, doth serue God 
with some prayers, surrendrynge thankes 
vnto hym for his manifolde goodnes, with 
askynge hym mercy for theyr offences. 
 
And before you go to your refectio~, moderatly 
exercise your body with some labour 
or playenge at the Tenys, or castyng of a 
bowle, or pasyng weyghtes or plommettes 
of lead in your handes, or some other thynge, 
to open the poores, and to augment naturall 
heate. At dyner and supper vse not 
to drynke of sondry drynkes, and eate not 
of dyuers meates, but fede of two or thre 
dysshes at the moste. After that you haue 
[^f.D3r^] 
dyned and supte, labour not by and by after 
but make a pause syttynge or standynge 
vpryghte, the space of an houre or more & 
with some pastyme, drinke not moche after 
dyner; at your supper vse hyghe meates, of 
dygestyon and refrayne from groose meates, 
go not to bed with a full nor an emptye 
stomacke. And after your supper make 
a pause or you go to bed, and go to bed as 
I sayde with myrth. 
 
FUrthermore as concernynge your apparayll. 
In wynter next your sherte, 
vse you to were a petycote of skarlet, your 
Doblet vse at your pleasure, but I do aduertyse 
you to lyne your Iaket vnder this 
fasshyon or maner, bye you fyne skynnes 
of whyte Lambe & blacke Lambe, and let 
your skynner cut both the sortes of the skynnes 
in small peces tryangle wyse, like halfe 
a quarell of a glasse wyndowe, and than 
sewe togyther a whyte pece and a blacke; 
lyke an whoole quarell of a glasse wyndowe, 
and soo sewe vp all togyther, quarell 
wyse as moche as wyll lyne your Iaket. 
This furre for his holesomnes is praysed 
[^f.D3v^] 
aboue Sables or any other kynde of furre. 
Your exteriall apparayll vse accordyng to 
your honour. In so~mer vse to were a skarlet 
Petycote made of stamell, or of lynse 
wolfe, in wynter and so~mer kepe not your 
heed to hote, nor bynde it to strayght, kepe 
euer your necke warme. In Sommer kepe 
your necke and face from the sonne, vse to 
were gloues made of Goote skynnes, perfumed 
with Ambredegrece And beware in 
standynge or lyenge on the grounde in the 
reflection of the sonne, but be mouable. If 
you shall commen or talke with any man, 
stande not styll in one place, yf it be on the 
bare grounde, or grasse, or stones, but be 
mouable in suche places, stande or sytte, vpon 
no stone or stones, stande nor syt not 
longe bare heeded vnder a vaute of stone 
Also be ware that you do not lye in no old 
chambres, whiche be not occupyed, specyallye 
suche chambres as Myce and Rattes, 
and snayles reforteth vnto. Lye not in 
no suche chambres the whiche be depryued 
cleane from the sonne, and open ayre 
Nor lye in no lowe chamber exepte that 
[^f.D4r^] 
it be bowrded Beware that you take noo 
colde on your feete, and legges. And of all 
wether beware that you do not ryde nor go in great and impytous wyndes.
