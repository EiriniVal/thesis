[}Regimen sanitatis.}] 
 
Anglorum regi scripsit schola tota salerni. 
Si vis incolumem/ si vis te reddere sanum. 
Curas tolle graues. Irasci crede propbanum. 
Parce mero. cenato parum. non sit tibi vanum 
Surgere post epulas. somnum fuge meridianum. 
Non mictum retine. non comprime foxiter anum. 
Hec bene si serues/ tu longo tempore viues. 
 
THis littell boke was compiled at 
the instance & for the vse of the moste noble 
and victorious kynge of Englande/ and of Fra~ce/ 
by the doctours and phisitians of the vniuersite 
of Salerne/ to conserue and kepe mans body in 
good helthe and prosperite. The auctor in the begynnynge 
of this boke teacheth .viij. generall doctrines/ 
whiche here after be specified and also declared. 
The firste doctrine is to eschewe & auoide 
(if we desyre corporall helthe) greatte charges/ 
thought and care. For thoughte drieth vp mans 
body/ hurtynge and leauynge the spiritis in desolation 
and comfortles: whiche so lefte/ and full of 
of heuines drieth vp the bones. In this doctrine 
be co~prehended melancolynes and heuines/ whiche 
greatly hurte the body: for by their operation 
the body waxeth lene and colde/ the harte shrynkethe 
vp/ the wytte and vnderstandynge cometh 
dulle/ the reason troubled/ & the memorie vtterly 
marred. Yet neuerthelesse/ it is very expedient for 
fatte and corsye folke to be some tyme pensyue and 
heuy/ that there by they may moderate the ranke 
[^f.B1v^] 
heate of their spiritis/ and make their bodies leaner 
and more sklender. The seconde doctrine is/ 
to eschewe anger. For anger in lyke maner drieth 
vp the boby/ and excessiuely chaffeth & inflameth 
the membres. And to greatte heate (as writethe 
Auicen in the firste dist. and fyrste chap. of the iij. 
doctrine) drieth vp mans body. Secondly anger 
hurtethe by the heate and infla~mation of mans 
harte/ and lettethe also the operations of reason. 
Some there be that naturally/ or by sickenes/ or 
chance of poyson/ are colde: for suche folke to be 
angrye is verye necessary for their bodily helthe/ 
that their naturall hete by suche meanes may be 
stered vp/ gotten/ and kepte. The thirde doctrine 
is to eate and drynke sobrely: for eatynge & drynky~ge 
excessiuely causeth vs to be vnlusty/ drousy/ 
& slouthfull/ hurtynge & infeblynge the stomake. 
Many other inconuenientises (as saith Auicen in 
the chap. of wyne and water) groweth and chanceth 
throughe excesse of meates and drynkes/ as 
here after shall be declared. The .iiij. doctrine is/ 
to make a lyght souper. For to moche meate take~ 
at nyght causeth and ingendreth gnawynge and 
payne in the bealye/ vnquietnes/ let of naturall 
rest/ and other grefes/ whiche we fele and se by experie~ce: 
the whiche here after shalbe more playnlye 
declaredde. The .v. doctrine is to walke after 
meate. For therby the meate disce~deth to the bottum 
of the stomake/ where (as Auicen sayth) restethe 
the vertue of digestion. For the mouthe of 
the stomake desireth foode/ and maketh digestio~. 
[^f.B2r^] 
The .vj. doctrine is to eschewe slepe inco~tinent after 
meate/ whiche causeth helthe and auoideth diuers 
infirmities/ as hit is after shewed in these 
verses: Febris/ pigrities &c. The .vij. doctrine is to 
make water as ofte as nedethe: For who that kepeth 
or holdethe his water longer than nature requirethe/ 
shall auoide it with great peyne: and so 
hit may chance that dethe shall folowe/ as Auicen 
saith in his .xix. dist. li. iij. and chaptre of the difficulte 
of makynge of water. Also to kepe the dregges 
and superfluite of mans foode longer tha~ nature 
requireth/ ingendreth many inco~uenientises 
in the body. For the liuer and veynes called meseraikes/ 
drie vp (for the moste parte) the humors 
of the forsayd superfluite/ and so made hard/ can 
nat be auoided: and thus causethe opilations in 
the guttis and ventosites/ and (so it may chance) 
impostumes: as after shall be shewed. The .viij. 
doctrine is/ that one doynge his easement and auoydyng 
ordeurs and filth of the body/ shuld nat 
moche inforce and constrayne his fundement: for 
so doinge the emerardes & fistule shal greue hym/ 
and the fundeme~t many tymes is mysordred and 
thrust out of his propre & naturall place. Finally 
thauctor saythe/ that who so wyll obserue the forsayde 
doctrines/ shall lyue longe in good helthe 
and prosperite. 
 
Si tibi defitiunt medici/ medici tibi fiant 
Hec tria. mens leta/ requies/ moderata dieta. 
 
Here thauctor gyuethe .iij. generall remedies to 
conserue in helth al creatures/ and specially noble 
[^f.B2v^] 
men. The firste is to lyue ioyfullye: for ioye and 
myrthe causeth man to be yonge and lustye. By 
moderate ioy and myrthe youth is conserued/ naturall 
vertue co~forted/ the witte sharped/ & therby 
man is more prompt/ quicke/ and of abilite to do 
all good and honest operation. Nor it is nat sayde 
without a cause that our ioy and myrthe muste be 
moderate. For whan it is without measure/ it ingendreth 
dethe bothe bodilye and goostlye. This 
moderate ioy is mooste conuenient for them that 
haue moche care and trouble. Whiche ioy may be 
gotte by the vse of delicate meates and drynkes/ 
by auoidynge of suche thynges as ingendre melancoly. 
And also (as Auicen sayth in his .xj. boke 
& chap. of faylynge of mans harte) by dwellynge 
and accompanyng amonge our frendes. The .ij. 
remedy is tra~quillite of mynde/ of vndersta~dyng/ 
and of thoughte. For noble men throughe theyr 
great busynes and charges/ are moche more greued 
& troubled tha~ other meane persones. Great 
care of mynde and vnderstandyng distroyeth the 
natural rest of man/ most expedient for noble me~/ 
whiche moste co~monly are naturally drye and colerike: 
for whom rest is ryght profitable and conuenient. 
The .iii. remedy is moderate diete/ that 
is to eate and drynke moderately. And after shall 
be declared what inconueniences growe through 
excesse of meates and drynkes. 
 
Lumina mane manus surgens gelida lauet vnda. 
Hac illac modicum pergat. modicum sua membra 
Extendat. crinem pectat. dentes fricet. ista 
[^f.B3r^] 
Confortant cerebrum/ confortant cetera membra. 
Lote cale/ sta/ pasce/ vel infrigisce minute. 
 
Here are declared .vj. doctrines/ whiche conforte 
mans brayne & the other membres of the bodye. 
The fyrst is whan we ryse in the mornynge yarly 
to wasshe our eies with clere colde water. The eies 
wolde be wasshed to cle~se away the ordure and 
fylthynes that hange in the bries of them. And 
Auicen saythe in the .xiij. dist. of his iij. boke/ and 
chap. of conseruacion of the eies/ that the souera~st 
thyng to mundifie and clense/ and to make sharpe 
of syght the eies/ is to open them/ and so to put & 
[/1./] 
plunge them in clere water. And agayne he sayth 
in the .iij. dist. and chaptre of feble syghte/ that to 
bathe and plunge the eies in clere water/ & therin 
to open them/ co~forteth and concerueth the sight/ 
and specially of yonge folke. The reason why the 
eies muste be clensed with colde water/ is bycause 
euerye thynge muste be conserued by that that is 
lyke hit. For Galen in his .iij. boke de reg. saythe/ 
that hotte bodies haue nede of hotte medicins/ & 
colde bodies colde medicins: Considerynge than 
that mans eies be colde of nature: hit standethe 
with reaso~/ they shulde be washed with colde water 
& nat with hotte. The .ij. doctrine is to washe 
our handes whan we be vp in the mornynge/ for 
they be intrumentes ordeyned to kepe & to mundifie 
the membres/ by the whiche the sup~fluites 
of the brayne be expulsed and auoided/ as by the 
nostrils/ the eies/ the eares/ and other naturall 
conditis. And therfore the ha~des specially oughte 
[^f.B3v^] 
to be washed with colde water/ for the washynge 
of the handes with hotte water engendreth wormes 
in the bealy: and specially to washe them in 
hotte water incontinent after meate/ as Auicen 
saythe in the .xvi. dist. of his .iij. boke/ the .v. treatice/ 
the chap. of wormes. For the wasshynge of 
handes in hotte water incontinent after meate/ 
draweth the inwarde and naturall heate of man 
to the exterior partis/ and so the digestion is vnp~fet: 
the whiche vnp~fet digestion is the principall 
cause that wormes be engendred. The thirde doctrine 
is to rome a lytell hither and thyther whan 
we are rysen from reste/ that so the superfluites of 
the stomake/ guttes/ & lyuer (as the grosse matter 
of the vrine) may y=e= spediler be thruste vnder. 
The .iiij. doctrine is competently after reste to extende 
and stretche out our handes/ fete/ and other 
lymmes/ that the lyfely spiritis may come to the 
exterior partis of the bodye/ and so cause the spiritis 
of the brayne to the more quicke and subtile. 
The .v. doctrine is to combe our heed in the mornynge/ 
to open the pores of the heed/ to auoide suche 
vapours as yet by slepe were nat consumed: 
and also to quicke~ the spiritis of the brayne. Farther 
more to combe the heed is very holsome/ and 
specially for aged me~. And Auicen saith in the .iij. 
dist. of his .iiij. boke/ and chap. of feble sight/ that 
to co~be the heed is holsome/ specially for olde men. 
Therfore one shulde dayly & ofte combe his heed. 
For ofte combyng draweth vp the vapours to the 
superior partis/ and so seperateth them from the 
[^f.B4r^] 
eies. The .vj. doctrine is to washe and purge the 
tethe. For the filthynes of the tethe causethe the 
brethe to stynke. And of the filthynes of the tethe 
growethe certeyne vapours/ that greatly anoye 
the brayne. Farther more the filthynes of y=e= tethe 
myngled with thy meate/ causethe the meate to 
putrifie in the stomake. Auicen in his .vij. dist. of 
the .iij. boke and chap. of co~seruacion of the tethe/ 
teacheth how we may kepe the tethe from ache & 
[/2./] 
stynche. That is to washe the mouthe with wyne 
twyse a moneth: but to make the brethe swete/ it 
muste be boyled with the roote of spurge. Who so 
euer vsethe the forsayde decoction & medicine shall 
neuer haue the tothe ache. In the laste verse are 
certeine generall rules: The first is that after we 
haue washed and bathed our selfe/ we muste kepe 
vs warme: For than the cunditis of the bodye/ 
that is the pores/ bene open: wherby colde wyll 
perce in to the bodye/ and ingendre in vs diuers 
diseases. The .ij. is/ that after we haue dyned or 
taken our repast/ we muste for a whyle stande vp 
ryghte/ that so the meate may discende to the bottum 
of the stomake/ and tha~ walke a litel softely: 
for hasty mouynge driueth naturall hete from the 
interior partes to the outwarde/ and causeth il digestion. 
The .iij. is/ that one of colde complexion 
shulde nat warme hym selfe to sodaynly/ but lytell 
and lytell. for sodayne change hurteth nature: as 
Galen sayth in the glose of this canon: Secundum 
multum et repente &c. All stronge thynges and of extreme 
nature corrupt the body. 
 
[^f.B4v^] 
Sit breuis aui nullus tibi somnus meridianus. 
Febris/ pigrities/ capitis dolor/ alq~ catarrus 
Hec tibi proueniunt ex somno meridiano. 
 
Here are declared .iiij. inco~uenientices enge~dred 
by after none slepe. Fyrst the after none slepe causeth 
and inge~dreth feuers by reason of opilatio~s. 
For the naturall hete and spirite of man by daye 
draweth to the outwarde partes of the body: and 
therfore digestion by day is but feble: But whan 
naturall heate and spiritis of ma~ drawe to the inwarde 
partis of the bodye: than throughe theyr 
motion naturall heate is stered vp: and therfore 
the nyght is the very season of perfite digestion: 
and the vndigested & rawe humours are y=e= cause 
of opilations/ whiche opilations enge~dre feuers/ 
as Auicen saythe in the .j. dist. li. iiij. and chap. of 
putrifaction. Secondly after none slepe causethe 
man to be slouthfull in his operations & busines/ 
by the reason afore sayde/ for grosse humours and 
vndigested cause mans spiritis slowelye to moue 
the bodye: For as a subtile quicke spirite causeth 
lyghtnes of body/ so a lumpishe spirite causeth a 
sluggishe boby. Thyrdly/ the after none slepe enge~dreth 
[/3./] 
heed ache: For the grosse and vndigested 
meate that remayneth in the stomake lyfte vp to 
the brayne grosse vapours/ whiche trouble hit. 
And of very co~sequens/ if vapours of gros mattier 
be stered vp & caused/ they must also be gros. 
For Galen saythe in the glose of this aphorisme: 
qui crescunt &c. that hit muste nedes folowe/ that all 
thynges be lyke those thynges/ of whom they be 
[^f.C1r^] 
engendred. The .iiij. inco~uenience is the pose and 
reume. Reumes be humours that rounne from 
one membre to an other/ and as they rounne in diuers 
partis of the bodye/ so they haue diuers names. 
For whan the reume cometh to the lightes/ 
they be called catarri: and whan they discende to 
the chekes/ they be called branchus: and whan 
they come to the nose/ they are called corizam: as 
appereth by these verses: 
 
Si fluit ad pectus/ dicatur reuma catarrus/ 
Ad fauces branchus/ ad nares dico corizam. 
 
But besides the reaso~s of the diseases before rehersed/ 
there be many other reasons/ and more effectuell. 
The cause of the first inco~uenie~ce/ that is 
of feuers/ whiche some tyme are called putrified 
feuers/ and some tyme feuers effimeres. A feuer 
effimere is enge~dred of vapours and smudge fumes 
kept and reteined after the after noone slepe/ 
the whiche absteynynge from slepe is wont to co~sume. 
The forsaide smudge fumes mixyng them 
selfe with mans spiritis engendre an vnordinate 
and a stra~ge feuer called effimere. The putrified 
feuer is ingengred of the humidites in man vndigested/ 
and augme~ted by the after noone slepe. 
The .ii. inconuenience that is to be slowe in operation 
and motions/ chanceth by reason that by the 
after noone slepe the humidites and fumes in ma~ 
are reteined about y=e= muskyls/ veynes/ & iointis/ 
and causeth the forsayde membres to be astonyed 
and a slepe: and therfore the bodye after dyner is 
slowe and heuy in operations. The thyrde inconuenience 
[^f.C1v^] 
(that is the heed age) cometh/ as is before 
declared in the .ij. inco~uenie~ce: that is to say/ 
by the humidites & vapours reteined in the body 
throughe slepe and rest: whiche by suche meanes 
are troubled and moued towarde the brayne/ and 
so cause the heed age. The .iiij. inconuenience is 
(that is the catarr~) signyfyenge al maner of reumes/ 
chanceth to man and vexeth hym/ through 
vapours and fumes/whiche are wonte to be dissolued 
& co~sumed by watche/ by slepe they drawe 
to the inwarde partis of ma~/ and fume vpwarde 
towarde the brayne: whiche fumes ingrossed by 
colde/ retourne to the lowe partis caterrisans of 
mans bodye. Auicen in the .xiii. dist. li. j. in the .ij. 
doctrine and .ix. chap. allegeth many other inconueniencis 
& diseases engendred of the after noone 
slepe. The firste disease is the goute and palsey. 
Whiche greue vs/ by reason that the humidites/ 
that are wonte to be dried vp and co~sumed by the 
heate of the sonne/ and by watche remayne styll 
in the body. The seconde is the color/ and corrupcion 
of the face/ through the wattrishe humidites 
lyke vnto mans vrine myngled with the bludde/ 
whiche are wonte to be wasted by watche/ y=t= nowe 
with the bludde they ascende towarde the brayne 
& the face/ and cause it to swelle/ and to waxe pale. 
The thirde inco~uenience is/ that after noone slepe 
ingendreth the splene/ and that by the kepynge in 
of the grosse melancoly humours by the day rest. 
For as watche with the heate of the day (whiche 
do open) gyueth mouynge and way to melancoly 
[^f.C2r^] 
humours/ by the strayte cundites of the body: so 
the daye slepe letteth and distroyeth the passages 
and p~pre wayes of them: & specially it destroyeth 
the cundites/ y=t= come from the splene to the mouth 
of the stomake/ made to prouoke mans appetite/ 
by whiche cundite all melancoly superfluites are 
wonte co~monly to be clarified. The .iiij. is/ that 
after noone slepe mollifieth the veynes/ by cause 
the humedites/ whiche are wonte to be desolued 
by the day watche/ can nat be resolued: whiche so 
remaynynge in mans body drie vp the veynes. 
The .v. inco~uenience is/ that ma~ by reason of rest 
or slepe/ losethe his appetite/ for lacke of humors 
resolution: whiche resolution is chiefe and principall 
cause of y=e= appetite. An other reason is the replenisshynge 
of the stomake by fumes and humidites/ 
mollifieth and fyllethe the mouthe therof. 
The .vi. inco~uenience/ that after noone slepe doth 
engendre/ is impostumes/ by meanes of humidites 
encreased by y=e= day slepe/ whiche drawe to one 
membre or other/ and so cause it to swelle. Auicen 
sayth/ that besides all these aforsayde/ there be .ij. 
other speciall causes/ that proue the after noone 
slepe to be hurtfull. The fyrst is/ that the day rest 
is soone corrupted/ bycause the heate of the daye 
draweth the corporall heate to the exterior partis 
of man: but the nyght rest dothe clene contrarie/ 
for it draweth the corporall heate of man towarde 
the inwarde partis. Of the whiche two motions 
there is engendred a violent mocion that distourbethe 
nature. And therfore they that wyll slepe & 
[^f.C2v^] 
rest them by day: are counsayled to slepe in darke 
places/ and in the shadowe. The .ij. cause is that 
the day reste maketh a man vnlusty/ drousy/ and 
as halfe a ferde/ and that by the changynge of nature 
from his olde custome/ that is from digestio~ 
of his meate: yet nat withstandynge that the after 
noone rest is generally dispreysed/ & the nyght 
reste greatly co~mended and preysed/ yet the slepe 
that is taken in the mornyng from iij. houres before 
the sonne rysynge/ tyll .iij. of the clocke after y=e= 
sonne is rysen/ is nat to be dispreysed: As Hippocrates 
saith in his .ij. boke of pronostic. Slepe co~uenient 
and naturall taken by nyght or by day is 
allowable/ and contrarie is hurtfull: but the mornynge 
slepe of all the day is left worthy dispreise. 
And all be hit the day slepe and at after noone are 
forbyden by olde fathers and doctours/ yet for all 
that/ nowe adayes slepe taken in the day tyme is 
nat greatly to be blamed specially as Bartrutius 
saythe/ if these .v. condicions therin be diligently 
obserued. The fyrst is/ if hit be customably vsed: 
The .ij that it be nat taken immediatly after dyner. 
The .iij. that one slepe nat with a lowe heed. 
The .iiij. nat to slepe to lo~ge. The .v. nat to be waked 
sodeynly & ferfully/ but with good moderatio~. 
 
Quatuor ex vento veniunt in ventre retento. 
Spasmus. hydrops. colica/ vertigo. quatuor ista. 
 
Here are declared .iiij. inconueniences that come 
by to longe holdynge of wynde in mans bodye. 
The fyrst is called the crampe. The ventosites of 
the body/ ronne ofte amonge the iointes & veynes 
[^f.C3r^] 
fyllynge them with wynde. Of the whiche fyllynge 
co~methe retraction and wrynkelynge to gether 
of the veynes. And Auicen saythe in his .ij. 
dist. the crampe is a disease that lyethe in the veynes: 
by the whiche the membres of man moue & 
extende them selfe. This crampe is diuers: one 
is caused by replenyshynge: wherby the membre 
is made shorte and great/ and wrynkelynge to gether 
as lether/ or a harpe strynge/ throughe the 
matter/replenyshynge the me~bres. This kynde 
of crampe cometh sodaynely. There is a nother 
kynde of the crampe moche lyke a taboret: whiche 
inforceth the membre after his lengthe & largenes 
to crompull to gether like parchement cast 
in the fire. This kynde of crampe cometh slowly. 
The seconde inco~uenience is called the dropsye/ a 
materiall disease enge~dred of mattier ryght colde 
entrynge and inflatynge the membres or places 
of mans body/ in whiche is the regiment/ that is 
the digestion of meates and humours as the stomake/ 
the lyuer/ and the voide places about the 
bealye. For dropsye neuer engendreth/ but whan 
the lyuer is corrupt by reaso~ of the bludde. There 
be .iij. spices of dropsy. Iposarca/ asclides/ & tympanites: 
& of the tympany this .ii. inco~uenie~ce is 
vnderstande. A tympany (as sayth maister Bartruce) 
is inge~dred of ill co~plextion/ by coldenes of 
the stomake/ & lyuer/ nat sufferyng mans drynke 
or meate to be co~uerted in to good humours/ but 
tourneth them in to ventosites/ whiche if they be 
auoyded by belchynge/ by sweate/ or other wyse/ 
[^f.C3v^] 
they wyll stoppe the wayes of voida~ce. Also these 
ventosities gether to gyther betwene the places 
of the bealye called mirac/ and siphax/ and there 
ingendreth the dropsy. The .iij. inconuenience/ is 
called the colike/ a perillous & a paynefull disease/ 
it ingendreth in a gutte named colon. Like as the 
disease called ilica/ is ingendred in one of the guttes 
called ylion. And these .ij. diseases are ingendred 
by ventosites closed in the guttes. The .iiij. 
inconuenience and disease is the heed ache called 
vertigo: whiche maketh a man to wene that the 
worlde turneth: the ventosites of the brayne causeth 
this infirmite: whiche drawe~ to the brayne/ 
& myxte with the lyuely spiritis/ causeth the heed 
age called vertigo. Auicen in his .xvj. dist. reherseth 
these inconuenie~ces with other: and he sayth 
that ventosites kepte longe/ cause and ingendre 
the colicke/ by reason they assende and gether to 
gether/ feblysshynge the guttes. And some tyme 
ingendreth the dropsye: and some tyme darkenes 
of syght/ and some tyme the megryme/ and some 
tyme the fallynge yuel/ and some tyme it runneth 
in to the ioyntes and causeth the crampe. 
 
Ex magna cena/ stomacho sit maxima pena 
Vt sit nocte lenis/ sic tibi cena breuis. 
 
Here we be taughte to make a lyght souper. For 
to moche meate lettethe mans naturall reste/ and 
causeth anguyshe & gnawyng in the bealy/ & causeth 
the face to breake out: & maketh one to haue 
a heuye heed in the mornynge/ and an vnsauerye 
mouthe. Here this question cemeth well to pourpose. 
[^f.C4r^] 
Whether a man shulde eate more at dyner or 
at soupper? For a diffinicion here of/ it is to be noted: 
that after the quantite of the bodye more or 
lesse/ meate is conuenient at soupper/ or at dyner. 
For other the bodyes be holle and sounde/ orelles 
sycke. If they be sycke eyther incline to materiall 
sickenes/ or to vnmateriall: Yf y=e= sickenes be nat 
caused through some humour: one may eate the 
more at soupper: bicause in suche sickenesses/ nature 
only endeuereth to digeste the meate. If the 
sickenes be materiall/ one maye eate the more at 
diner/ as it is declared in the .iiij. treatise in th .v. 
chap. of the curation of fallynge sickenes on this 
wyse: He that can nat be sufficed with one repast 
in a day/ bicause he is other wyse accustomed/ he 
must deuide his meate in thre partis/ and eate .ij. 
partis at dyner/ and the other parte after temperate 
exercise at soupper. The reaso~ here of is this: 
For in suche sesonne y=e= feble nature hath helpe by 
the naturall heate of the sonne to digest/ and the 
superfluites there by are more resolued/ wherfore 
the refection shulde be larger at diner tha~ at soupper. 
And more ouer bycause the heate of the day/ 
whiche causeth digestion/ ioyneth with the naturall 
heate of mans body: and so by day are .ij. sondrye 
heates to helpe the digestion: but it is nat so 
in the nyghte. Lyke wyse nature endeuereth by 
night to digest the sup~fluites. Therfore it shulde 
nat be hyndred to digest with to moche meate. 
And though it be so that the naturall heate of ma~ 
be in many thynges fortified in the nyght: as by 
[^f.C4v^] 
retraction of the spiritis and reductio~ of slepe: yet 
that selfe heate can nat digest .ij. diuers thynges/ 
as the meate/ & the sup~fluites. Than it foloweth 
that suche folke shulde eate lesse at souper. If the 
bodyes of suche seme hole/ or elles be verye hole/ 
stronge/ & without any sensibilite of superfluites/ 
auoydynge all through theyr vigour/ as myghty 
bygge men: suche may eate more at soupper. For 
the nature of these bodies/ labour only by nyghte 
to digest the meate receyued: and nat to rype the 
superfluites: for in a maner they haue none. Also 
they labour onely to fortifie theyr bodies/ whiche 
waxethe more stronger by nyghte/ than by daye: 
bicause the bludde and corporall spiritis be ingendred 
by nyght in a more quantite/ and better deuided 
throughe out the bodye. If the bodies be nat 
greatly disposed/ as is rehersed: but are disposed 
to be lyghtly sicke: Than whether they trauayle 
and labour sore co~tinually with theyr armes and 
handes or nat: hit is best they eate more at dyner 
than at soupper. For meate is nat onely taken to 
norishe & restore y=e= body: but also to make moyste/ 
to ouer sprynkylle and water the membres/ that 
through great labour and trauaile they waxe nat 
drie: and lyke wyse to withsta~de the dissolution of 
naturall heate. Nor suche trauayle & labour letteth 
nat theyr true digestion. For we se by experience/ 
that they eate twyse or thryse in a daye with 
good appetite/ and good digestion. If the bodies 
be nat apte nor disposed to labour co~tinually/ as y=e= 
bodies afore rehersed: hit may chance .ij. wayes: 
[^f.D1r^] 
For either they labour very sore/ but nat continually: 
or they labour febly: wherby sup~fluites encreace. 
They that trauayle moche: as in rydy~ge 
or goynge aboute theyr worldlye busynes/ shulde 
eate more at soupper than at dyner: bycause the 
vnaccustomed great trauaile wolde nat suffre the 
meate taken at dyner to digest/ but corrupte hit. 
Yea and farther through superfluous mocion the 
naturall heate is disolued/ & spredde in euery me~bre 
of the body: whiche in the nyghte draweth to 
the inwarde partis of the body/ and is the principall 
cause of good digestion. And therfore a good 
and a large soupper is more expedient for them/ 
than a large dyner. Also the same p~sons were nat 
brought vp before this sesonne in suche great trauayle: 
and therfore theyr bodyes are full of humidites: 
whiche lyttell meate at dyner maye resyste 
y=e= resolutions caused by great motions & trauaile. 
But in case they trauaile lyttell and easelye by the 
way/ to eate more at dyner tha~ at soupper is best: 
as hit is declared in sicke bodies/ for they most co~monly 
are feble bothe of co~plection & of digestion/ 
and the heate and lyght of the sonne co~forte theyr 
naturall heate and spiritis. Also the reason herof 
is this/ the corporall cu~dites and passages by day 
are open: wherfore the sup~fluites of the body are 
sooner expulsed by daye than by nyghte. Farther 
they ought to eate but lyttell meate by nyght: for 
tha~ nature is greatly occupied to digest rawe humours: 
the whiche slepe must digest and brynge 
to good poynt. And though the digestion to digest 
[^f.D1v^] 
great repletions of meates/ and the superfluous 
humours be holpe by the night. Yet neuer y=e= lesse/ 
the streingthynge therof is nat sufficie~t to digest 
great repletions of meates/ and also superfluous 
humours. And weteth well/ y=t= custome in eaty~ge 
moche or lyttel at dyner or soupper/ oughte to be 
regarded/ and kepte. For custome is good and necessary/ 
for helthe of y=e= body/ and to cure sickenes: 
as appereth .li. ij. of sharpe diseases. For sodeyne 
change of custome is very hurtfull/ and specially 
for olde folkes. For nature can nat beare nor yet 
suffre sodeyne mutation. And thus it is well proued/ 
that we ought to eate more at dyner than at 
soupper: and that bicause sickenesses are most co~monly 
materialles/ yet for all that/ if a man coude 
be contented with one repast in a day/ it were better 
to take it at soupper/ than at dyner: so that he 
be nat diseased in the eies/ or the brayne: for than 
it were better to take it at dyner/ than at soupper. 
For the repletion of the soupper/ hurtethe sore the 
brayne and the eies. And witteth well that nat onely 
the repletion of the soupper/ hurteth the stomacke/ 
but also al maner of other repletions. For 
they ingendre opylations/ feuers/ putrifactions/ 
the lepre/ and vndigested humours. And Auicen 
(in the .xiij. dist. of his iij. boke/ and chap. of thinges 
that hurte the stomake) sayth/ that al maner 
of repletions hurt the stomake: nor y=e= great eater 
by repletion augmenteth nat his bodye/ for he digesteth 
nat his meate: but he that eateth moderately/ 
hath alwayes some appetite/ & increaseth 
[^f.D2r^] 
his body: for he digesteth well his meate. Therfore 
we ought to take good hede we hurte nat our 
stomake by ouer moche repletion: nor y=t= we make 
nat our selfe poursye/ and the pulse to beate more 
vehemently. In lyke maner repletion that inge~dreth 
lothynge of meate/ ought principally to be 
eschewed/ but specially whan it cometh of ill meates. 
For if hit come by ill meates/ hit ingendreth 
payne in the ioyntes/ in the raynes/ in the liuer/ 
and the goute: and generally al other fleumatike 
diseases. And if it come by clene meates: it inge~dreth 
sharpe feuers/ and hotte impostumes. It 
foloweth than that this repletion muste be eschewed 
aboue al other. For it greueth both soule and 
body. Secondly we muste take hede we ouer fylle 
nat our stomakes: and vtterly distroye our appetite: 
but we muste kepe some appetite: and specially 
they that haue a stro~ge and a good appetite. 
Some there be that haue a feble appetite/ & these 
ought to eate more than their appetite requireth. 
 
Tu nunq~ comedas/ stomachum nisi noneris ante 
Purgatum/ vacuumq~ cibo quem sumpseris ante 
Ex desiderio poteris cognoscere certo 
Hec tria sunt signa subtisis in ore dieta. 
 
Here are certeine co~mandementes/ whiche man 
desyrynge helth/ muste of necessite obserue & kepe 
more duely than eate or drynke. The fyrste is/ he 
shulde eate no maner of meates/ without his stomake 
be net/ and purged of all yll humours/ by 
vomet or other co~uenient wayes. For if a man receyue 
meate with corrupte humours into his stomake: 
[^f.D2v^] 
they wyll myngle them selfe to gether and 
cause the meate newely eaten to corrupt. The seconde 
is/ to eate no more tyll the fyrst meate eaten 
be digested and auoyded out of the stomake. For 
there is nothynge more hurtfull to mans bodye/ 
than to caste meate vpon meate nat digested/ but 
only begunne to be digested. For the meate last taken/ 
shall let the digestio~ of that y=t= was first eaten: 
and the digestion of the meate firste taken/ shalbe 
first finyshed: whiche departeth to the lyuer by y=e= 
veines called miseraikes/ and therewith cariethe 
the meate laste taken nat yet well digested. Wherof 
rawe humours and vndigested be multiplied 
in mans bodye. Farther in the texte are put .ij. tokens/ 
to knowe whan the stomake is voide of the 
meate before taken. The fyrste is verye hunger. 
And for a knowlege hereof/ witteth well y=t= there is 
ij. maner of hungers/ very hunger/ and feyned 
hunger. Uery hunger is discriued by Galen in y=e= 
co~ment of the canon of the aphorisme/ Indigentia 
non oportet &c. Uery hunger (saythe he) is whan a 
man nedeth meate: But fayned hunger is an appetite 
to haue meate/ thoughe the bodye hath no 
nede therof. And as verye hunger cometh by contraction 
and corrugation of the veynes procedy~ge 
from the mouthe of the stomake/ by sugillation of 
the membres nedynge meate: so in lyke wyse feyned 
hunger is wonte to be caused of them that co~strayne 
that they shulde p~uoke the mouthe of the 
stomake/ the membres hauyng no nede of foode/ 
as by colde thynges harde or sharpe. And of this 
[^f.D3r^] 
signe & .ij. precept precedent/ Auicen .iij. j. doct. ij. 
cap. de eo quod &c. saythe: No man ought to eate 
but after he hath a luste: Nor he shulde nat tarye 
longe therin/ whan lust pricketh/ onles it be a feyned 
luste/ as the luste of kronkers/ of suche whose 
stomake aborrethe meate: For to endure hunger 
longe fylleth y=e= stomake with putrified humours. 
And after in the same chap. he saythe: That who 
so euer loue their helth/ shulde neuer eate tyll they 
haue a sure luste: nor tylle theyr stomake and vppermoste 
entrayles/ be voided of the fyrste foode. 
For the dangerust thinge that may chance mans 
body/ is to receiue meate vpon dndigested meate. 
The .ij. that signifieth true luste/ or very hunger/ 
is sklendre diete precede~t: that is small sustina~ce 
before taken: for wha~ hunger foloweth there vpo~ 
it is verye true hunger. Farther more knowe ye/ 
that to eate moche and of sondry meates mixed to 
gether at one repaste or refection/ is worste of all: 
as fleshe and fishe/ chekyns and porke: and after 
to p~longe the tyme in eatyng: For the first meate 
begynnethe nowe to digest/ whan the other are 
brought to the table: and so the partis of y=e= meate 
are vnlyke in digestion: So that the fyrste taken 
are digested/ or the last taken come to the myddes 
of theyr digestynge: And this causethe that some 
partis corrupt other some. And this thyng Auice~ 
iii. j. doct. cap. ii. de eo &c. warneth/ sayeng: There 
is nothynge more dangerous than to myngle diuers 
sustinances to gether: and after to prolonge 
the tyme in eatynge. For whan the laste meate is 
[^f.D3v^] 
receyued/ the fyrste is welnere digested. Therfore 
the said meates in diuers of theyr partis (as touchy~g 
digestion) be nat lyke. But yet witteth well/ 
that prolongynge of tyme in eatynge moderately 
[/4./] 
(as an houre space) to chawe and swolowe our 
meate well/ is allowable/ & helpeth moche to the 
conseruation of helthe. For good chawynge and 
swalowynge downe is as halfe a digestion: And 
ill chawyng of the meate doth either let digestio~/ 
orels doth greatly hyndre it. But prolongynge of 
tyme in eatynge/ with talkynge and tellynge of 
tales .ij. or .iij. houres/ is ryght hurtfull: & therof 
are ingendred the diseases before rehersed. 
 
Persica. poma. pira. lac. caseus. et caro salsa. 
Et caro ceruina. leporina. caprina. bouina. 
Hec melancolica sunt/ infirmis inimica. 
 
Here are declared .x. maner of meates or foodes 
that ingendre melancolye/ and are vnholsome for 
sicke folkes. Of whiche the fyrst is eatynge of peches: 
[/5./] 
Wherof Galen .ij. alimentor~/ cap. ix. sayth/ 
the ieuce of peches/ and their materiall substance 
is soone corrupted and vtterly yll. Wherfore they 
ought nat as some say/ to be eate~ aft other meate. 
For they swymmynge aboue are corrupted. But 
this oughte to be mynded/ whiche is a commune 
thynge/ that all that is moyst/ slyppery/ & lightly 
gothe vnder/ shulde be eaten fyrste: and so shulde 
peches: whiche swyftely go to the bottum of the 
stomake/ and make way for the meates that come 
after. But whan they be eaten last/ they corrupte 
them selfe and the other meates. And thus it appereth/ 
[^f.D4r^] 
that this sayenge ought to be vndersta~de 
of peches eaten afer other meate. For whan they 
be eaten before meate they be good for y=e= stomake/ 
mollifie the bealye/ and prouoke the appetite: as 
Auicen in the .ij. Canon & chap. of peches saythe: 
Ripe peches be good for the stomake/ & gyueth an 
appetite to meate. And farther he saithe: They 
ouhgte nat to be eaten after other meate: for they 
corrupt after/ but they must be eaten before. Like 
wyse Serapion/ in y=e= chaptre of peches/ by auctorite 
of Dioscorides/ saithe: Rype peches are good 
for the stomake/ and they mollifie the bealy: But 
whan they be nat rype they make a man costiue: 
and whan they be drie they bynde sorer. And decoction 
made of drie peches and dronken/ doth let 
the flowynge of humidites to y=e= stomake & bealy. 
And the pouder of peches cast vpo~ y=e= place where 
one bledeth/ stancheth the bludde. And al though 
peches haue these medicinable vertues aforsaid: 
yet bicause they inge~dre putrified humours/ they 
be hurtfull to sicke folkes/ and specially wha~ they 
be nat taken dewly. Peches be colde in the fyrste 
degree/ and moyst in the seconde. The seconde is 
[/6./] 
peres/ or eatyng of peres. The cause is/ for peres 
(and generally al maner of newe and rawe frute) 
fylle y=e= bludde with water/ boylynge vp in the body: 
And so prepareth the bludde to putrifie/ and 
by consequens hurtfull for sicke folkes. Peres/ as 
Auicen in .ij. canon~/ and chap. of them/ sayth/ engendre 
the colicke. But yet peres aboue all frute 
make folke fatte. And therfore hogges fedde with 
[^f.D4v^] 
peres/ are made fatter tha~ w~ any other frute. And 
bicause peres inge~dre ventosites/ and so cause the 
colicke: therfore they be vsed to be eate~ with suche 
frute that breake or auoide ventosites: or elles to 
withsta~de the ill operation of these frutes/ drynke 
after them/ a draughte of olde wyne of good sauour. 
And the sweter sauour that peres haue/ & 
the more doulce/ the better they be. And also sodde 
peres be better tha~rawe: and they may be sodde 
with anys sede/ fenell sede/ & suger. The thirde is 
[/7./] 
eatynge of apples: whiche as Auicen saythe (.ij. 
can~. cap. j.) to eate often and moche cause ache of 
the senowes. And also apples haue an yll p~prete/ 
in enge~dryng ventosites in the seconde digestion/ 
wherfore they be vnholsome for sicke folkes. And 
also for lyke cause as hit is before sayde of peres. 
And these sayenges of peres and apples oughte 
speciallye to be vnderstande whan they be rawe/ 
and nat whan they be sodde or roste. And nat only 
these frutes shulde be eschewed of them that that be 
sycke/ but also all other frutes that fyll the bludde 
with boylynge water: as newe frute/ whose ieuce 
boylethe in mans bodye as hit were must or newe 
wyne. And ieuce of frute boyle without in a vessell 
and that is through the hete of the sonne that remayneth 
in them whan they ryped. These newe 
frutes/ through boylynge of their ieuce/ cause the 
bludde to putrifie. All though wha~ they be eaten 
they comfort a mans bodye with theyr moysture. 
And for this cause Auicen forbyddeth them specially 
eatynge of frute/ y=t= haue the ague/ in his .iiij. 
[^f.E1r^] 
dist. and chap. of the vniuersall cure/ sayenge: All 
frutes hurte them that haue the ague/ throughe 
theyr boylynge and corruptyng in the stomake. 
The iiij. is eatynge of mylke: the cause why eatynge 
[/8./] 
of mylke is nat good/ is bicause it is lyghtly 
corrupted/ and turneth vnto fume or sharpenes 
in the stomake/ as in theyr stomake specially/ that 
are diseased with putrified feuers; & therfore they 
that haue a putrified feuer are forbyden eatynge 
of mylke. And to them also hit is hurtfull y=t= haue 
the heed ache/ to them y=t= haue the swyns pockes/ 
& to many other: Wherof Hippocrates speakethe 
in the Aphorisme: Lac dare caput &c. to gyue them 
mylke that haue the heed ache is verye hurtefull. 
Yet nat withstandynge in some diseases/ mylke is 
agreable for them that haue the tysike/ the feuer 
etike/ and for some other: as Hipp. saith in y=e= afore 
allegate aphorisme. And also folowynge/ some 
thinge shall be saide wha~ we come to Lac ethicis &c. 
And all though mylke in the forsayd diseses is blamed/ 
yet in them that be holle it is allowable/ and 
that if it be well digested in the stomacke & lyuer. 
For tha~ it washeth the e~trayles with it wattrishenes/ 
and hit mundifieth with hit buttrines: and 
striueth agaynst venomous humours: and with 
hit chese moysteth the membres/ and alleuiateth 
the grefes of the brest: and hit doth mitigate the 
shotynge or prickynge of the longes/ guttes/ raynes/ 
entrayles/ and of the bladder: and it is good 
agaynst prickynge humours in the entrayles. 
Farther more mylke is good for te~perate bodies/ 
[^f.E1v^] 
whose stomake is clene from colerike and flumatike 
humours. For to suche folke mylke well digested 
is great nourysshynge/ hit ingendrethe good 
bludde/ it nourisheth the body/ and conuenientlye 
moysteth and makethe faire y=e= exterior partis: as 
Isaac saith in the vniuersall dietis. And there also 
he sayth by auctorite of Ruffus: that they that 
wyll drynke mylke/ must drynke it fastynge: and 
it must be dronke hotte from the cowe: and to eate 
nothynge tyll that be digested: and nat to labour 
nor stere aboute moche than. Yet seldome or at no 
tyme one shulde forbeare walkynge/ but than one 
muste walke an easye pace/ tyll he parceiue hit be 
discended to the bottum of y=e= stomake. But mylke 
is vnholsome for these bodies that be diste~pered. 
For in hotte bodies it is soone turned in to colerike 
fumosite. In suche as be colde/ hit tournethe to 
sharpenes and putrifaction. Also mylke is vnholsome 
for an vnclene stomake: for therin it corrupteth. 
[/9./] 
Touchynge the choyce of mylke/ hit is to be 
noted/ that meane mylke is to be chosen for nourishement/ 
and nat thynne mylke/ as mylke of a camell/ 
or of an asse: nor the most fatte and grosse is 
nat to be chosen/ as mylke of kyne & shepe: wherfore 
goottis mylke shulde be chosen. For hit is nat 
so wattrishe as camels mylke: the whiche is nat 
apte to nourishe/ by reason of humidite/ and hit 
maketh a man to laske: Nor it is nat so fatte/ nor 
so grosse/ nor so full of curdes and butter/ as kowe 
mylke and shepis mylke is: whiche by reason of 
theyr fatnes/ stoppethe veynes/ and engendre ve~tosites: 
[^f.E2r^] 
and is more harder of digestion tha~ is necessary 
in gouernance of helth. Therfore mylke of 
a gootte/ nat to nere kyddynge tyme nor to farre 
from it/ and that goth in a good pasture/ & whan 
pastures be at the best/ shulde be chosen. The .v. 
is eatynge of chese: and it may be vnderstande of 
[/10./] 
all sortes of chese/ but specially of olde chese. The 
reason is bycause newe chese is colde/ moyst/ and 
of grosse substance/ and harde of digestion: & engendreth 
opilations and the stone: and helpeth or 
co~serueth mans helth (by way of nourisshement) 
very littell or nothynge: And olde chese is hotte & 
drie/ by reason of the salte therin/ hit causeth digestion: 
but yet of it selfe/ it is harde of digestion/ 
& of small nourisheme~t/ and hurteth the stomake/ 
& drieth ouer sore/ & agreeth wors tha~ newe chese. 
But chese betwene bothe/ neyther newe nor olde/ 
[/11./] 
nat to tough nor to brittill/ to harde nor to softe/ to 
swete nor to sower/ nat to salte/ nor to full of eies/ 
of good tallege & of good sauour whan it is cutte/ 
whiche tarieth nat lo~ge in the stomake/ made co~ueniently 
of good mylke/ sufficiently oyly. Suche 
chese is good and shulde be chosen afore all other: 
whereof after meate we shulde eate a lyttell quantite: 
for moche in qua~tite/ in way of nourisheme~t 
is vniuersally ill/ and hurteth the stomake/ & wyll 
nat digeste/ and engendreth opilations/ the stone 
in the raynes/ grosse humours in the body/ & ventosites. 
Therfore that chese is onely good that co~meth 
out of any gardes handes. The .vj. is salte 
[/12./] 
meate: dryed with salte or smooke/ and of what 
[^f.E2v^] 
kynde of best so euer hit be/ hit engendreth grosse 
bludde and melancoly: and so per co~sequens/ it is 
vnholsome for sicke folkes: nor holsome for them 
that be hole: as Auicen .ij. j. doct .ij. cap. xv. about 
the ende/ sayth: that salte flesshe nourissheth but 
littell/ and that it is grosse/ & enge~dreth yl bludde. 
[/13./] 
The .vij. is hartis fleshe/ whiche lyke wyse enge~dreth 
melancolye bludde/ as witnesseth Rasis Alma~ 
.iij. cap. de animalibus siluestribus et domesticis. 
[/14./] 
The .viij. is hare fleshe/ whiche lyke wyse engendreth 
melancoly bludde/ as Rasis sayth in y=e= place 
afore allegate: This fleshe enge~dreth more mela~colye 
than any other. And of this Isaac in dictis 
vniuersalibus sayth: that hare fleshe shulde nat 
be eaten as meate/ but onelye vsed in medicines. 
And witteth well that hare fleshe & hartis fleshe/ 
whan they be olde oughte vtterly to be eschewed: 
yet neuer the les they may be eaten/ & they be best 
before caluynge tyme/ that theyr drines may be 
tempered with the age: And yet they ought to be 
eschewed excepte they be fatte. For their drines is 
tempered with theyr fatnes. The .ix. is goottis 
fleshe. The .x. is oxe fleshe. For these be melancolye 
flesshes. For Isaac in dictis vniuers. saythe: 
[/15./] 
Gootis fleshe and oxe fleshe be worst/ hardest/ and 
slowest of digestion: and whan they be digested/ 
they engendre grosse bludde and melancoly. And 
Auicen in his .ij. canon of goottis fleshe saythe: 
Goottis fleshe is nat very good/ and p~chance the 
humour is very yll. And lyke wyse ye shal vnderstande 
of goottis fleshe and cowes fleshe: whiche 
[^f.E3r^] 
are worse than the forsaide fleshes/ gootis and oxfleshe. 
For of them Auicen in the .ij. Canon the 
chap. of fleshe/ sayth: Cowe fleshe/ hartis fleshe/ 
wylde goottis fleshe/ and great foules enge~dreth 
the feuers quartans. And yet farther he saythe of 
cowe fleshe: that cowe fleshe nourissheth moche/ 
and engendreth grosse melancoly/ and melancoly 
disseases. And he saythe farther that cowe fleshe 
engendreth lepre. And of goottis fleshe he saythe 
that hit is absolutely yll. And for as moche as hit 
is touched in y=e= texte what fleshes shulde be eschewed/ 
specially of .iiij. footed bestes: me semeth hit 
were conuenient/ to shewe/ what fleshe of iiii. footed 
bestis are to be chose~. And in the choyce of fleshes 
[/16./] 
the phisitians agree nat. For Galen and certeyne 
other say/ that porke is best. Some other/ 
as Auicen/ Rasis/ and Auerreoys say/ that kyddis 
fleshe is beste. Yet nat withstandynge Auerroys 
in the .v. coll. blamethe Auicen/ by cause he sayde 
porke was beste: yet he sayde it nat as though he 
helde therwith/ but after the christen opinion. 
Some other preyse vele aboue all other. The .ij. 
is/ a man may knowe the best fleshe of .iiij. footed 
bestis & y=e= goodnes/ therof many maner of wayes. 
Fyrst by great nourisshynge/ whiche thinge betokeneth 
harde digestion/ & by the lykenes of mans 
fleshe: and this wise porke is better tha~ any other 
fleshe/ fyrste for the lykenes vnto mans fleshe: as 
witnesseth Galen .iij. alimentor~/ where he sayth: 
That porke is like mans fleshe/ may be knowen/ 
by that that many haue eaten ma~s fleshe in stede 
[^f.E3v^] 
of porke/ and coude nat perceiue neither by the sauour 
nor the taste/ but that hit had bene porke. 
And Auicen .ij. canon~. cap. de sanguine/ saythe: 
Mans bludde and hogges bludde be like in euery 
thynge: so that there haue bene that haue solde 
mans fleshe in stede of porke/ whiche thyng was 
nat spied/ tyll a mans fynger was fonde amo~ge y=e= 
fleshe. Auerrois writeth y=e= same in the .v. coll. cap. 
de carne. Secondely/ Porke nourisheth greatly. 
For Gal. saithe .iij. alimentor~/ that porke aboue other 
fleshe nourishe mooste: wherof those that be 
called athlete haue beste experience. And after in 
the same boke he saythe: One can eate no fleshe y=t= 
nourisheth more tha~ porke. Thirdly porke enge~dreth 
a stedfaste and a stronge nourishement/ resistynge 
resolution. This is Galens opinion in the 
places afore rehersed/ where he preferrethe porke 
aboue all other fleshe: and in his .viij. boke de ingenio/ 
he saythe/ Porke of all fleshe is moste laudable: 
so that it be wylde brought vp on montaynes: 
and next porke kyd. And lyke wise in .v. tera. 
he saith: Of al fleshe of .iiij. footed bestis porke is 
most laudable/ whiche is temperate in heate and 
moysture: and engendreth better bludde tha~ any 
other fleshe: so that hit be of yonge swyne/ that is 
of a yere or .ij. olde/ whether hit be wylde or tame: 
nor yonge suckers are nat so good: for theyr fleshe 
is mooste moyste. And of a more lykelyhod wylde 
porke broughte vp in the woddes/ is better than 
tame brought vp at home: for tame porke is more 
clammy tha~ it ought to be. And of wylde hogges 
[^f.E4r^] 
fleshe or boore/ Auicen .ij. Canon~/ cap. de carne/ 
sayth: Christen men and their folowers say/ that 
[/17./] 
the best wylde fleshe that is/ is of a wylde swyne. 
For besides that that it is more light than y=e= tame 
swynes fleshe/ it is of more strengthe and moche 
more nourishynge/ and more soner digesteth: and 
in wynter there can be no better fleshe. So tha~ it 
foloweth that hogges fleshe is ryghte good & holsome 
for their bodies that be yonge/ hole/ stronge/ 
occupied in labour/ and nat disposed to opilatio~s: 
& for them that desyre to be fatte. For suche haue 
nede of moche nourishement: and harde of digestion. 
And therfore Rasis .iij. Alma~soris/ cap. de 
virtute carniu~/ saith: Grosse fleshe is conuenable 
for them y=e= labour moche: but clene fleshe is beste 
for them that do contrarie wyse. Auicen wyll the 
same .iii .i. ca. de regimine eius quod comeditur. sayenge: 
They that labour moche maye better a way with 
grosse meates than other. The choyce of good fleshe 
standeth in .iij. thynges: in temperance of co~plection/ 
in lightnes of digestion/ and ingendry~ge 
of good bludde: that is to say/ the better fleshe is 
of temperate complection/ easy of digestion/ and 
temperate in engendrynge bludde/ betwene hotte 
and colde/ sklendernesse/ and grossenes. And for 
this cause kydde fleshe is better & more laudable 
than any other fleshe/ after the mynde of Rasis/ 
Auicen/ and Auerrois. For Rasis. iii. Alma~soris/ ca. 
de animalibus/ siluestribus et domesticis. saythe: Kydde 
fleshe is temperate/ without any yll mixion: the 
whiche though it ingendre temperate bludde/ yet 
[^f.E4v^] 
hit is nat conuenient for laborers: but yet for all 
that/ no nother fleshe shulde be preferred before 
it. Hit is nat so weke/ that man strength is minished 
therby: nor the nourishynge therof is so moche 
grosse/ y=t= replecion shulde come of it/ or grosse 
bludde be engendred. The bludde also that is engendred 
therof/ is betwene subtile and grosse/ hotte 
and colde. Nor this fleshe is nat mete for greatte 
labourers/ but for attemperate yonge folkes/ vsynge 
meane exercise. For this fleshe engendreth 
bludde/ that by myghty exercise of labour is sone 
resolued/ but nat with meane trauaile. And (touchynge 
the inte~tion) as kydde fleshe is better tha~ 
any other housolde fleshe/ so gottis flesshe is better 
tha~ any other bredde in the woddes. And next 
to kydde flesshe many phisitians/ as Rasis and 
Auerrois/ put mutto~. And Auerrois saith .v. coll. 
cap. de carne: That mooste part of phisitions are of 
this opinio~/ saue Galen whiche laudeth nat mutton. 
And he thynketh that veale nourisheth more 
than mutton. And perauenture Galen vndersta~deth 
here the betternes of nouryshement of that 
that is to nourishe moche/ and to gyue nourissheme~t 
more harde of resolution/ whiche more agreeth 
vnto veale than mutton/ syns mutton is of 
more humidite. Thirdly the goodnes and choyce 
of fleshe maye be taken by reason of theyr smalle 
cla~mynes/ and by theyr good sauour: and herein 
veale is better than any other fleshe. And this is 
shewed of Auerrois .v. coll. ca. de carne/ sayenge: 
And veale is good fleshe bicause hit is nat cla~my/ 
[^f.F1r^] 
colde/ nor drie as befe is/ and veale hath a swetter 
sauour than any other fleshe: and in these poyntis 
it is better than kydde fleshe: for in kyd fleshe 
one may perceiue a clammynes before it is sodde: 
and in that y=t= veale inge~dreth better humours/ it 
is better tha~ kyd. And thus it appereth playnely 
what is the cause of controuersite amonge phisitians 
[/18./] 
touchynge the choyce of flesshes. Farther 
witteth well/ that the fleshe of drye co~plection/ is 
better nere caluynge tyme tha~ farre from it: And 
therfore kyddis and caulues be better tha~ goottis 
and oxen: bicause their drines is abated with the 
humidite of theyr yongnes. But fleshe of beastis 
of moyst complection/ is better and more holsome 
in age than in youthe. For theyr ouermoche humidite 
is dried moche awaye/ as they encreace in 
age: And therfore wethers of a yere olde are lesse 
cla~my and more holsomer than suckynge la~mes: 
and lyke wyse porkes of a yere or .ij. olde/ are better 
tha~ yonge pygges. And therefore Auicen saith 
well .iii. i. cap. de reg. eius quod comeditur. It behoueth 
y=t= the meate/ that conserueth helth shulde be suche 
as the fleshe of kydde or a suckyng caulfe is/ or la~mes 
of a yere olde. By these reasons it apperethe 
than that the fleshe of goottis male and female/ 
of olde mutton/ of befe/ of olde porke/ and specially 
of brawne/ of pygges/ and of suckynge lammes/ 
is nat verye holsome for the conseruation of 
mans helthe: but the fleshe of yonge caulues/ of 
yerelynge wethers/ and porke of a yere or .ij. olde/ 
is conuenient inoughe to eate to preserue mans 
[^f.F1v^] 
[/19./] 
helth. And it is to be well noted/ that fleshe enclyned 
to drynes/ muste be sodde: and inclynynge to 
humidite/ muste be rosted/ to attempre theyr humidite: 
And therfore the fleshe of conys/ haaris/ 
hartes/ calues/ and kyddis/ shulde be sodde: and 
porke and la~me rosted: for sethynge attemprethe 
the drynes. And herby appereth/ that in moyste 
seasons/ and for moyst complections fleshe disposed 
to drynes/ shulde be rosted: and in drie seaso~s/ 
and for complections drie and olde/ moyst meates 
be more conuenient. 
 
Dua recentia/ vina rubentia/ pinguia iura. 
Cum simila pura nature sunt valitura. 
 
Here in this texte bene expressed dyuers nouryshynge 
meates. The fyrst are newe layde egges/ 
[/20./] 
whiche be of that sorte/ that in littell qua~tite nourishe 
moche/ as saythe Auicen .ii. canon~. cap. de ouis. 
and lyke wyse he saythe in .iiij. j. cap. j. Thynges 
(sayth he) of smalle quantite and great nourishement 
are egges and cockes stones. And the selfe 
same he repetethe in manye other places. Touchynge 
the choyce of egges/ witteth well that the 
egges of hennes/ pertriches/ and fesances yonge 
and fatte are very good in regiment of helth/ and 
simply/ better tha~ any other egges: For the prest 
daughter sayde/ that lo~ge egges and smalle were 
the best of all/ as in these verses: 
 
Filia presbiteri iubet pro lege teneri. 
Quod bona sunt oua/ candida/ longa/ noua. 
 
Farther/ poched egges/ are better than egges 
rosted hard or rere/ and they be of great nourishement/ 
[^f.F2r^] 
and of good and lyght digestion/ and enge~dre 
bludde speciallye proportionable to the harte: 
Wherfore they be excedynge good for suche as be 
recouered from sickenes/ for aged folke/ and for 
weake p~sons/ and specially the yolke. For Auicen 
in the treatise de viribus cordis saith: that the yolke 
of egges/ of foules whose fleshe is goad to be eate~/ 
as of hennes/ pertriches/ and fesantis/ thoughe 
they be nat medicinable for the harte/ yet they co~forte 
ryghte moche. And he addethe folowynge: 
That they be lyghtly turned in to bludde: & after 
they be turned/ they haue small superfluite: And 
therfore they comforte mooste specially the harte. 
And farther he saythe/ that they be excellent good 
to restore the spiritis & bludde of the harte: Rere 
rosted egges are lyghtly digested/ and they ease y=e= 
longes and the breste/ and mollifie the bealy te~perately/ 
but they nourishe nat to moche as poched 
egges. Harde egges sodde are harde of digestio~/ 
and they nourishe the body grossely/ descendynge 
slowly to the stomake/ & slowly they entre therin: 
Farther witteth well/ that egges by the dressinge 
[/21./] 
of them are made better and worse. For eyther 
they be rosted/ sodde/ or fried/ or sodde with some 
brothe. Rosted egges be more grosse than sodde/ 
and more harde of digestion: for the herthe or fire 
driethe vp theyr substanciall humidite. And they 
be rosted .ij. wayes: For either in the shelles they 
be raked in the hotte imbers/ orels they be broken 
in the shelles: They that be broken be worse than 
the other: but they that in the shelles be raked in 
[^f.F2v^] 
the hotte imbers are done .ij. maner of wayes/ either 
they be all raked in the imbers/ orels sette vpon 
imbers & coles with parte vncouered. They 
that be al couered be worse: for by reason that the 
heate of the fire goth about them/ the fumosites/ 
are kepte styll in/ they that be sette vpon the ymbers/ 
parte vncouered/ auoyde out the fumosites 
and be mundified. They be better sodde~ in water 
tha~ rosted: for the humidite of the water striueth 
with the heate of the fire/ drienge their humidite. 
And so they be dressed .ii. wayes: For eyther they 
be sodde in the shelles/ orels broken in the water. 
Sodden in the shelles are worse than the other. 
For the shelles lette dissolution of fumosites and 
grossenes. Whan they be poched/ the heate of the 
water temperately perceth in/ and maketh more 
pure theyr grossenes: and takethe awaye the yll 
smell and sauour. Wherfore poched/ they be most 
holsome/ and worst fried: For fried they ingendre 
most yll humours/ and hurte the stomake/ & causethe 
[/22./] 
fumosite and corruption/ and maketh one to 
lothe his meate. But sodde in some good brothe 
are betwene bothe/ rosted and poched. Also wytteth 
well/ that there is a diuersite in an egge/ touchynge 
his co~ponde partis. For the yolke is temperately 
hotte: The white is colde and clammye/ 
and hardlye digesteth/ and the bludde also therof 
[/23./] 
engendred/ is nat good. And as the forsayde egges/ 
that is to say of hennes/ pertriches/ and of 
fesantis/ be more co~uenable in y=e= regime~t of helth: 
so egges of duckes/ gees shouelardis/ & suche like 
[^f.F3r^] 
foules/ are vnhlsome in the regiment of helthe/ 
and shulde be eschewed. The .ij. is redde wyne. 
[/24./] 
Where vpon ye shall vnderstande/ y=t= wynes differ 
in colours. For some wynes be whyte/ some claret/ 
some citrine/ and some blacke. White wyne is 
febler tha~ any other/ colder and lesse nourishyng/ 
but they leest hurte the heed/ and they make one 
to pysse better than other. That they be weaker 
than other wynes appereth: for after Galen. sup~. i. 
canone. iii. p~ticule regiminis acutorum. Weake wyne is 
hit/ that leest heteth or enflameth/ & lesse greueth 
the brayne than other. That white whyes be colder 
than other apperethe by Galen in the co~ment 
of the canon iii. partic. reg. acutorsi. where he saythe 
of white wyne/ thus: It is impossible that white 
wyne shulde greatly enflame any man. And after 
he saith: White wyne enflameth or heteth leest of 
all wynes. Whiche thynge is trewe/ if one wyll 
make co~parison betwene white wyne and redde of 
one countre growynge/ and none other wyse. For 
the redde wynes of Fra~ce are nat so hotte/ nor yet 
so stronge as the whyte wynes of some other cou~tre. 
And therfore the co~parison muste be made betwene 
the wynes of one maner and countre: and 
that they nourishe lesse than other wynes appereth 
by Galen in the co~ment of this aphorisme. ii. 
particule aphoris. It is easyer to fyll one with drinke 
than with meate: where he saythe: Watterysshe 
sklender & white wyne/ is vniuersally neighbour 
to water: and as touchynge nourishement is like 
water/ wherby it prouoketh one to pisse/ and nourisheth 
[^f.F3v^] 
the body but lyttell.
