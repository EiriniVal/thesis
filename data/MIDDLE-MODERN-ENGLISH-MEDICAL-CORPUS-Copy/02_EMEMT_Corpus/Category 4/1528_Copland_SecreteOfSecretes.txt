[}& Of the dyfference of astronomy.}] 
 
ALexander fayre sone/ I praye the/ that 
yf thou mayst do it/ that thou ryse not/ 
nor eate/ nor drynke/ nor do ony other thy~ge/ 
but by the councell of some that knoweth 
and hath the scye~ce in knowlegynge 
the sterres and astronomye. And thou shalte wyte 
my dere sone that almyghty god hath made nothynge 
without cause/ but hath done euery thynge 
reasonably. And by certayne scyences and wayes/ 
the wyse phylozopher Platon sought and felte the 
operacyons of all thynges composed of the foure elementes/ 
and the humoures contraryes. And hadde 
also the knowlege of the thynges created and formed 
And also my dere sone Alexander I praye the beleue 
not such fooles which say y~ y=e= scye~ce of y~ planettes is 
so harde to be knowe~/ & that none maye come therto. 
Surely they be fooles and wote not what they say. 
[^f.D4v^] 
It is a noble thyng to knowe thynges whiche be to 
come. Yf thou knowest the thynges whiche be to come/ 
thou and other p~sones may put remedy by good 
prayers. And requyre the creatoure that hath ordeyned 
them to retourne theyr malyce/ & ordeyne them 
otherwyse. Thynke not dere sone that god hath ordeyned 
& predestynate such thynges/ but that by his 
power he may chaunge them otherwyse whan he 
pleaseth. wyte thou dere sone y~ y~ good people pray to 
our creatoure w~ orysons & deuout petycyons/ by fastynge 
& sacrefyces/ by almesse & other maner/ axyng 
of pardon of theyr synnes/ & doynge penaunce/ y~ our 
lorde may retorne & reme~bre suche predestynacyons 
whiche other do feare so moche. Retorne we dere 
sone to our fyrst purpose/ wyte thou y~ astronomye is 
deuysed in .iiij. p~tes. That is to wyte in ordynaunce 
of sterres. In y=e= dysposycyon of sygnes/ & of theyr elongacyons. 
Of the moeuynge of the son~e. And this partye 
is called scyence of astronomy: The other parte is 
of y~ knowlege of the moeuynge of the skyes & of the 
mone. And this partye is called astronomy. And is y=e= 
worthyest/ of sterres/ planettes/ & sygnes. And there 
is .M.xxviij. planettes sygned/ and formed/ of y=e= whiche 
we shall speke more playnly. 
 
[}[^The Latin abbreviation symbol for con- omitted.^]. Of the gouernayle of helth.}] 
 
HElthe amonge all thynges is to be gote~ 
and hath more than ony myght of rychesses. 
For y=e= kepyng of helth is by vsynge 
of equal thynges conioyned to the body/ 
as by attemperaunce of humoures. 
[^f.E1r^] 
For the gloryous god hath ordeyned the~/ and gyuen 
dyuers remedyes to the attemperau~ce of the humoures 
to the kepyng of helth. And hath shewed it to his 
holy men and prophetes/ & to many other Iust men 
whiche he dyde chuse and enlumyned with the holy 
goost/ in his sapyence dyuyne/ and myghty. And 
hath gyuen them the gyftes of the scyence/ of these 
thynges here after folowynge. These phylosophers 
put the begynnyng of it. That is to wyte they of ynde/ 
of Grece/ and of Athenes. whiche phylosophres 
were Iust and perfyte/ and theyr wrytynges were 
the begy~nynge of scye~ce & secretes. For in theyr wrytynges 
is nothynge founde to be reproued nor spylt/ 
but approued of all wyse men. 
 
[}[^The Latin abbreviation symbol for -rum omitted.^]. Of the gouernayle of seke people.}] 
 
ALl wyse and naturall phylosophres say y~ 
man is made and composed of foure contrary 
humours/ the which haue alway 
nede to be susteyned with meate and dry~ke. 
The substaunce wherof behoueth to 
yssue and be corrupte yf ony do alway eate and drynke/ 
and he sholde waxe weyke and fall in grete dyseases/ 
and haue many inconuenyences. But yf he eate 
and drynke te~peratly and reasonably/ he shall fynde 
helpe of lyfe/ strength of body/ and helth of all the me~bres. 
The wyse phylosophres saye that yf any man 
trespace the god of nature/ and the good maner of lyuynge/ 
be it in to moche eatynge and drynkynge/ or 
to moche slepynge/ or wakynge/ in to moche walky~g 
or restynge/ beynge to laxatyfe/ or to moche letynge 
[^f.E1v^] 
of blode or to lytell/ it can not be but he must fall in many 
dyseases/ and greues. Of the whiche dyseases I 
haue bryefly founde/ and therin wyll I shewe the 
my councell/ & remedye for the same. All wyse phylosophres 
accordeth in one sayeng. who so kepeth hym 
fro ouermoche eatynge & drynkyng/ & frome y~ excesses 
aforesayd & kepeth temperau~ce/ he shal be helthfull 
of his bodye/ & lyue longe. For I can fynde no ma~ 
but he is of this opynyon/ & wyll saye y~ all delectable 
thynges of the worlde/ be it in pleasure of y~ body/ it 
is but for to lyue y~ longer in them. But for a more secrete 
ye ought to enforce you to do suche thynges as 
ben belongynge to longe lyfe/ & not to folowe the appetyte/ 
y~ is to wyte/ not to put lye meate upo~ meat. 
And dere sone I haue herde often spoken of ypocras 
which kept many tymes dyete to the~de y~ he myght 
lyue & endure the longer. Not for to lyue and endure 
for y~ meate & drynke. Also dere sone it is grete holsomnesse 
to be purged of superfluytees & euyll humours 
whiche ben in y~ body. 
 
[}A. In how many maners a man may kepe his helthe.}] 
 
GOod sone I praye the haue in thy mynde 
stedfastly these certayne instruccyo~s and 
kepe the~. Knowe thou that helth is chyefly 
in two thynges. The fyrst is lete a ma~ 
vse suche meates & drynkes as he hath be~ 
nourysshed with. The seconde that he purge hym of 
yll humours that be corrupte & greue hym. For y=e= body 
of man is fedde w~ meates & drynkes whiche nourysshe 
[^f.E2r^] 
it by naturall heate that dryeth/ nouryssheth 
and fedeth y~ moystnesse therof. 
 
[}B. Of dyuers meates for y~ stomake.}] 
 
WHa~ y~ body is fat & full of vapours grosse 
meates is good for it. & of y=e= nourysshy~g 
of suche a body/ y=e= dygestyo~ is grosse/ & 
of grete qua~tyte for y=e= great heate/ & vapours 
of y=e= body. And wha~ the bodye is 
sklneder & drye/ subtyll & moyste meates be good for 
it. And y~ dygestio~ therof is of smal qua~tyte for y~ streytnesses 
of y=e= coduytes. And it is grete wysdome & scyence 
for a man to vse suche meates as ben good & appertene~t 
to his co~plexyo~/ that is to wyte yf he fede hym 
w~ hote meates te~peratly. But yf the heate be to greuous 
& bre~nynge w~in the body by ouer stronge wynes 
& hote meates/ or other accydentes/ tha~ co~trary 
meates & drynkes wyl do grete ease & prouffyte/ y~ is 
to wyte suche as ben colde. [}Of the stomake.}] 
 
Yf thy stomake be to hote tha~ hote & cours meates 
be good. For such a stomake is lyke a myghty fyre for 
to bre~ne gret weyght of logges. But wha~ y~ stomake 
is colde & feble tha~ it is good to haue lyght & subtyle 
meates. [}The sygnes to knowlege y~ stomake.}] 
 
The sygnes of a stomake y~ is of an yll & weyke dygestyo~ 
is wha~ y~ body is vnlusty/ heuy/ & slouthful/ y~ 
face is swolle~/ & he yaneth ofte~/ & hath payne in his 
eye~/ & bolketh often & rudely/ & y=e= bolkyng is sowre & 
vnsauery/ watry & stynky~g/ & therby is bree~de wyndes 
& swellynge of the bely & y=e= appetyte of meaet is 
marde. Therfore swete sone beware of meates and 
drynkes y~ may hurte or be contrary to thy helth. 
 
[^f.E2v^] 
[}C. An epystle of grete value.}] 
 
MOost dere sone Alexa~der sythe it is so that 
the body of man is corruptyble by dyuersyte 
of co~plexyon/ & of contrary humours 
that ben in it/ wherby ofte~ there cometh 
corrupcyo~ to it/ I thought to delyuer the 
some thyng y~ shall be necessary & prouffytable to the. 
In the whiche I wyll treate of the secretes of physyke 
whiche shall please the. For certayne dyseases come 
to a kynge whiche be not honest to shewe to physycyens. 
And yf thou wylt obserue this lesson/ thou 
shalt haue no nede of physycyens/ except in causes y~ 
may come in batayle/ the whiche may be exchewed. 
Alexander fayre sone/ whan thou rysest frome thy slepe/ 
walke and stretche thy membres egally and combe 
thy heed/ for stretchyng of the lymmes gyueth force/ 
and combynge reyseth the vapoures that ben come 
in slepynge and putteth them frome the stomake 
In somer wasshe thy heed in colde water/ whiche 
shall yelde the naturall heate/ and shall be cause of appetyte 
to meate. Than clothe the with goodly and ryche 
apparell. For the hert of man delyteth in the beholdyng 
of precyous meates & clothy~g. Than rubbe 
thy tethe with some cours lynnyn/ or other thynge 
that is hote and drye of co~pleccyon/ and swete of smell 
for it is holsom for the tethe/ and kepeth them clene/ 
clenseth the stenche of the mouth/ and clereth the voyce/ 
and gyueth appetyte to eate. And rubbe thy heed 
often in the same wyse for it openeth the claustres of 
the brayne/ and thycketh the necke and other membres/ 
and clenseth the face and the syght/ and prolongeth 
stowpynge of of aege/ and amendeth the blode. 
[^f.E3r^] 
Also anoynt the somtyme with swete smellynge oyntementes/ 
as the tyme requyreth/ for in suche swetenesse 
thy hert taketh grete pleasure/ & is nourysshed 
therby. And y=e= spyryt of lyfe taketh refeccyon in good 
odoures: and the blode re~neth meryly thrugh y=e= vaynes 
of the body. After that take somtyme an electuary 
of a wood called Aloes/ and of Rubarbe whiche is 
a precyous thynge/ to the pryce of foure pens. Which 
thou shalte fynde wryten in the boke of physyke/ and 
this shall do the moche good/ for it voydeth the heate 
of the mouth of the stomake/ and warmeth the body 
and wasteth wyndes/ and maketh good taste and sauoure. 
After this I cou~cell y~ that thou be often with 
thy noble and wyse men of thy realme/ & speke to the~ 
of thy besynesses that thou hast to do. And gouerne 
them sadly accordynge to theyr good customes. 
 
[}D. Of the maner to trauayle.}] 
 
OR euer thou eate or thyn appetyte cometh 
at thyn houre accustomed do som 
trauayle/ that is to wyte walke or ryde 
a lytell/ or do some other worke/ for 
it helpeth y=e= body moche/ it voydeth all 
ventosytees/ and maketh the body lyghter stronger 
and lustyeth the stomake/ and wasted euyll humoures 
of the body and maketh the flewme of the stomake 
descende. [}Of the maner of eatynge.}] 
 
Fayre sone wha~ thy meate is set afore the/ eate of 
suche as thou desyrest moost/ resonably/ with well 
leuayned breed. And eate of such as ought to be fyrst 
eaten. For there be two maners of dygestyo~ of meat 
[^f.E3v^] 
in a man that is to wyte/ softe/ & harde. For in the boto~ 
is moost heat for to make meat/ bycause it is moost 
flesshly/ and nyghest the heat of the lyuer wherwith 
the meate is soden and dygested. 
 
[}E. Of abstynence of meat.}] 
 
Wha~ thou eatest/ eate by leasure/ though 
thou haue grete appetyte to eate. For 
yf thou eate gredely noughty humoures 
do multyply/ the stomake is laden 
the bodye is greued/ the hert is hurte/ 
and the meate remayneth in the stomakes botome 
vndygested. 
 
[}F. How pure water ought not to be dronke~.}] 
 
ALso beware dere sone that ye drynke no 
pure water/ specyally whan thou haste 
eaten meate. But yf thou be wont therto. 
For as soone as the water is vpon the 
meat/ it coleth y~ stomake/ and quencheth 
the heate of the dygestyon and comforte of the meat 
It letteth dygestyon and greueth the body. Yf thou 
must nede drynke water alone/ take it the moost temperatly/ 
and as lytell as thou mayst. 
 
[}G. Of the maner to slepe.}] 
 
WHan thou hast taken thy refeccyon and 
hast luste to slepe/ lye downe on a softe 
bedde and slepe temperatly. Aud fyrst 
lye downe on the lyfte syde/ and slepe 
theron a reasonable space/ for the lyfte 
syde is colde and hath nede to be warmeth. And yf 
thou fele ony payn in thy bely or in thy stomake/ tha~ 
[^f.E4r^] 
lay therto a souerayne medycyne/ that is a warme 
lynnen cloth layde theron. Wyte y~ dere sone that trauayle 
is good/ and gyueth heate to the stomake. But 
after dyner it is a noughty thynge/ for the meat abydeth 
vndygested in the botome of the stomake/ and 
therof be bredde many dyseases. And slepe before fedynge 
is not good/ for it maketh the body leane and 
dryeth the humoures. But slepynge after fedynge is 
good/ for it fulfylleth y=e= body & gyueth force/ & nourysshyng 
therto. For wha~ y~ body of ma~ resteth/ tha~ y~ natural 
heat draweth y=e= heat y=t= was spredde in all y~ me~bres 
in to y=e= boto~ of y=e= stomake/ & gyueth stre~gth therto 
vpo~ y~ refeccyo~ of y~ meat. And heat requyreth rest. 
Therfore some phylosophres haue sayd y~ it is better 
& holsomer to eat at nyght than in the mornyng/ for 
the eatyng in y=e= mornynge bycause of y=e= heat of y~ day 
greueth y=e= stomake/ & y=e= body is more trauayled therw~. 
And moreouer y~ p~sone chauffeth i~ trauaylyng doynge 
his besynesse/ in goyng & speky~g/ & many other 
thy~ges y~ belo~geth to y~ body of ma~/ by y=e= which heat 
y~ is outwarde towarde none/ y~ naturall heat y~ is inwarde 
is weyked & appeyred/ & y~ meate is harde to 
dygest. But at nyght it is more easy & lesse greued w~ 
y~ heat of traueyle. And y~ hert & me~bres of ma~ be~ more 
in quyet by y~ coldnesse of y=e= nyght/ that gyueth naturall 
heat to the stomake. 
 
[}H. The kepyng of custome or wont.}] 
 
THou shalt vnderstande my dere sone that 
he that is wonte to eate but one meale ofte~ 
is dyseased/ for y=e= stomake is wi~out dygestyo~ 
& y=e= body hath smal nourysshy~g. And 
he y~ is acustomed to eate at one time ones 
[^f.E4v^] 
another tyme twyse he shal lyghtly perceyue that it 
doth hym harme/ for custome chargeth nature. 
 
[} I. How one ought to chaunge custome}] 
 
ANd yf nede constreyne the to chau~ge thy 
custome/ do it wysely/ that is to wyte by 
lytel and lytell. And so by the grace of god 
thy chaungynge shall be good. But aboue 
al thynges beware that thou eate not 
tyl thou fele thy stomake empty and that it hath made 
good dygestyon of the fyrst meale. And this thou 
mayst knowe by y~ desyre that thou shalt haue to thy 
meate: and by thy spatle that tornyth subtylly in thy 
mouthe. And yf thou eate without nede or appettyte 
the heate of thy stomake shall be made colde as yse. 
And yf necessyte be y~ thou must eate/ & haue an appetyte 
therto/ y=e= kynde heate of thy stomake wyll be as 
hote as fyre/ & of good dygestyo~. And beware y~ wha~ 
thy appetyte cometh that thou eate not forth w~/ for it 
wyll gadre yll humours of thy body in to thy stomake/ 
whiche wyll hurte thy brayne. And yf thou tary 
ouer lo~ge or thou eate/ it wyl feble thy stomake/ & the 
meate wyll do thy body no good. And yf so be y~ thou 
mayst not eate as soone as thy appetyte requyreth/ 
and y~ thy stomake be ful of yll humours/ do so y~ thou 
mayst vomyte or thou eate/ & after y~ vomyte take an 
electuary/ and eate surely. 
 
[}K. Of the foure seasons of the yere.}] 
 
[^f.F1r^] 
OUr intencyon is to treat in this boke of y~ 
foure seasons of the yere/ with the qualyte/ 
propryete/ contraryte/ and dyfference 
of eche of them. And they ben certayne 
seasons of the yere deuyded as foloweth. That is to 
wyte prymtyme or vere begynneth whan the sonne 
entreth in the sygne of Aries/ and lasteth foure score & 
xiij. dayes/ and .xviij. houres/ & the fouthe parte of 
an houre. That is to wyte frome y=e= .x. day in y~ ende of 
Marche/ to y=e= foure and twenty day of Iune. And in 
this season the dayes & nyghtes ben egall of length 
The wether is fayre. The warme wether cometh. 
The snowes melte/ ryuers renne swyft and clere/ & 
waxe warme/ the moystnesse of the erthe ryseth to y~ 
heyght of trees/ and causeth them to smel swete. Medowes 
and graynes sprowte and corne groweth/ & 
all floures take coloure/ byrdes ben clothed with newe 
robes/ and enforce them to synge. Trees ben decked 
with leues and floures/ and the landes with sedes. 
Beestes engendre and all people take strength & 
lust. The erthe is arayed goodly/ & is as a fayre bryde 
clothed with Iewelles of dyuers coloures bycause 
she sholde seme the fayrer at her weddynge. 
 
[}L. Of prymtyme/ and what it is.}] 
 
THe prymtyme is hote & moyst temperatly 
as the ayre. This season y~ blode moeueth 
and spredeth to all the membres of the body/ 
and the body is parfyte in temperate 
complexyon. In this season chekyns/ kyddes/ 
and poched egges ought to be eaten/ with letuses 
[^f.F1v^] 
& gotes mylke in these thre monethes. Prymetyme 
begynneth whan the sonne entreth the sygne of 
Aryes and lasteth .xcii. dayes/ an houre and a halfe 
fro the .x. day of Marche to y=e= .x. day of Iune. In this 
season is the best letyng of blode of ony tyme. And tha~ 
is good to trauayle and to be laxatyfe. And to be bathed. 
And to eate suche thynges as wyll purge y=e= bely. 
For all dyseases that cometh/ eyther by purgyng 
or bledynge/ retorneth anone in this prymetyme. 
 
[}M. Of somer and what it is.}] 
 
SOmer begynneth wha~ the sonne entreth 
y=e= fyrst poynt of the creuyce & lasteth .xcii. 
days/ & an houre & a half That is to wyte 
fro y~ .x. day of Iune to y~ .x. day of septe~ber 
In this seaso~ y=e= days be lo~ge & y~ nyghtes 
short. And i~ al regyo~s e~creaseth & abateth theyr heate 
& y~ see is calme/ & y~ ayre meke & fayre. The flours wyther 
& serpe~tes encrease & shed theyr venym/ & sprede 
theyr stre~gth. The myghtes of ma~nes body be fortyfyed. 
And all y~ world is ful of welth/ as y~ fayre bryde 
y~ is goodly stature & in p~fyte aege. The seaso~ of somer 
hote & drye/ & tha~ coler is moeued. And i~ this seaso~ is 
good to beware of all thy~ges y~ be hote & drye of co~plexyo~. 
And take hede of to moche eatyng or drynkynge 
for therby is y=e= kyndly heate quenched. In this seaso~ 
eate meates of colde & moyst co~plexyo~/ as veale/ mylke 
w~ vyneygre/ & potages made w~ barly meale. Eate 
fruyt of eygre sauour/ as po~megarnets/ & drynke 
small wynes/ & vse not the co~pany of wome~. In this 
season lete the not blode/ but yf grete nede co~pell the. 
Use lytell trauayle/ & seldome bathynge. 
 
[}N. Of Autumpne/ or heruest.}] 
 
[^f.F2r^] 
HEruest entreth wha~ y~ sonne cometh in 
to y~ fyrst degre of the balaunce & lasteth 
xci. dayes & an houre & a halfe. That is 
to wyte fro the .x. daye of Septe~bre to y=e= 
x. daye of Decembre. In this season the 
day & nyght be of one length. And tha~ y~ dayes waxe 
short & y~ nyghtes longe. The ayre is derke/ & y~ wyndes 
entre the northen regyons or septe~tryo~. The wether 
chau~geth/ & y~ ryuers & spryges waxe lesse. The 
orcheyardes & fruytes wydreth. The beaute of erthe 
fadeth. Byrdes cease theyr syngyng. Serpe~tes seke 
theyr holes wher they assembled theyr lyuyng in somer 
for y~ tyme of wynter. The erthe is as an olde naked 
woman y~ gooth fro youth to aege. This season of 
heruest is colde & drye/ this tyme blacke coler is moeued. 
In this seaso~ is good to eate meates y~ be hote & 
moyst as cheky~s/ lambe/ & drynke olde wynes/ eate 
swete reasyns. And kepe y=e= from all thynges y~ brede 
blacke coler/ as lyenge w~ wome~ more than in somer/ 
nor bath y=e= not but yf grete nede requyre it to be done. 
In this season yf a man haue nede of vomytynge/ do 
it at none in the hotest of y~ day. For at y~ tyme al y~ sup~fluytees 
of mannes body gadreth togyder Also it is 
good to purge y=e= bely w~ a medycyn ordeyned therfore 
& other thy~ges y~ be~ to expulce blacke coler & to refrayne 
humoures. 
 
[}O. Of wynter and what it is.}] 
 
Wynter cometh wha~ y~ son~e e~treth y~ fyrst 
degre of y~ sygne of Caprycorne & lasteth 
lxx. dayes/ & an houre & a halfe. And begy~neth 
y~ .x. day of Decembre/ and co~tynueth 
to y~ .x. daye of Marche. In this 
[^f.F2v^] 
seaso~ y~ nyghtes be lo~ge & y~ days short/ it is veray colde. 
The wynes be in y=e= presse/ & y~ leues fall/ & herbes 
leeseth all theyr strength/ or the moost parte. All bestes 
hydeth them in caues and pyttes of hylles. The 
ayre and the wether is darke. And the erthe is lyke 
an olde decrypyte persone/ that by grete aege is naked 
and nygh to the deth. Wynter is veray colde and 
moyst/ & than behoueth the vse hote meates/ as chekyns/ 
hennes/ motton/ and other hote & fatte flesshe/ 
eate fygges/ nuttes/ and drynke grene wynes. And 
beware of to moche laxe and bledynge/ & eschewe co~pany 
of women/ for it wyll feble thy stomake/ and bathes 
be good. And for the grete colde the natural heate 
entreth in to the body/ and therfore the dygestio~ is 
better in wynter tha~ in somer. And in heruest the bely 
is colde/ and than the poores ben open by heate of 
the season/ and reproueth the naturall heate of all the 
partes of y~ body. And therfore the stomake hath but 
lytel heate/ wherby the dygestyon is febled/ and the 
humours assemble there. 
 
[}P. Of naturall heate.}] 
 
SOne Alexa~der I pray y~ kepe the kyndly 
heate of thy body/ and thou shalt haue lo~ge 
helth. For the body of man dyeth in .ij. 
maners. One is by grete aege the which 
ouercometh the body and dystroyeth it. 
The other is accydentally/ as by wepen/ sykenesse 
or other aduenture. 
 
[}Q. Of thynges that fatteth the body.}] 
 
[^f.F3r^] 
Ryght dere sone these ben thynges that fatteth 
the body. That is to wyte ease of the 
body and fyllynge it w~ deynty meates and 
drynkes/ & mylke/ and tha~ to slepe on a soft 
bed. All swete smellynge floures in theyr 
season/ and bathynge in fresshe waters. But yf thou 
bathe the/ tary not longe in it/ and haue swete smellynge 
thy~ges in y~ bath. And neuer drynke wyne but 
it be well tempered w~ water. And specyally in wynter 
make water of floures called Assynini and put it 
in to thy wyne/ for it is hote of nature. And in somer 
vse vyolettes and floures of malowes & other thynges 
that be colde/ & vse to vomyte ones in a moneth 
specyally. For vomytes wassheth the body and purgeth 
it of wycked humoures and stynke that is in it. 
And yf there be but few/ humoures in the stomake/ 
it conforteth the naturall heate. And whan thou hast 
vomyte wyllyngly/ the body wyll fyll it with good 
humydyte and be of good dysposycyon to dygest. And 
yf thou gouerne the thus/ thou shalt be mery at thy 
hert/ lusty with reasonable helth and good vndersta~dyng/ 
glory & honour/ & ouer al thyn enemyes vyctory. 
Also I wyll that thou delyte in the beholdyng of 
goodly persones/ or in redynge of delectable bokes/ 
or in weryng of precyous garme~tes/ and goodly Iewelles/ 
as the tyme requyreth. 
 
[}R. Of thynges that leaneth the body.}] 
 
THese ben the thynges that maketh the body 
to be leane/ weyke/ and drye/ to moche eatynge/ 
to moche trauelynge/ to moche walkynge in the 
[^f.F3v^] 
so~ne/ to moche goyng/ to moche slepyng afore noone 
melancoly/ feare/ to bathe in water of the nature of 
brymstone/ eatynge salt meates/ to moche drynkynge 
of olde wyne/ to be to laxe/ and ouermoche letynge 
of blode. For ypocras sayth that he y~ batheth him w~ 
a full bely/ or lyeth with a woma~ shal haue sykenesse 
in his entrayles. And also to re~ne/ or to ryde/ or to moche 
trauayle after meat bredeth a grete dysease called 
palsey. And moche eatyng of fysshe, or mylke and 
wyne togyder ypocras sayth it wyl make one lazar. 
 
[}S. Of the fyrst parte of the body.}] 
 
OF y~ .iiij. partes of y~ body the heed is y=e= fyrst. For 
in y=e= heed gadreth all sup~fluytees/ and euyll humoures/ 
whiche thou shalt fele and knowe by these 
sygnes folowyng. The eyes be~ troubled/ the heryng 
is thycked & y~ nosestrylles be~ stopped/ yf thou fele suche 
a dysease take an herbe called wormwood/ and sethe 
it in swete wyne tyll the halfe be wasted/ tha~ holde 
it in thy mouth & wasshe it many tymes therwith 
tyl thou fele y~ it dooth y~ good/ & eate whyte mustard 
sede powdred w~ thy meate. And yf thou do not thus 
thou mayst happe~ to haue som dysease/ & specyally in 
thyn eyes/ in thy brayn/ & in other p~tes of thy body. 
 
[}T. Of the seconde parte of the body.}] 
 
THe seconde parte of the body is the bulke/ 
yf dysease come there thou shalt knowe it 
by these sygnes folowynge The to~gue is 
lette/ y=e= mouthe is salt/ bytter/ & vnsauery 
The mouth of the stomake is sowre with 
[^f.F4r^] 
grefe in all thy me~bres. It behoueth y~ to eate but lytel 
& to vomyte/ tha~ eate a lytel sugre of roses w~ aloes 
& take good co~fortyng spyces & eate an electuary named 
Dionisiu~. And yf thou do not th~/ thou mayst fal 
in dysease of y~ syde/ of y~ raynes/ & feuers/ & specyally 
of y=e= togue wherby y=u= shalt not p~perly speke/ & dyuers 
other maladyes. Decoccyon of ysope is good. 
 
[}U. Of the thyrde parte of the body.}] 
 
THe thyrde parte of the body is the wo~be/ yf it 
be co~bred w~ euyll humoures y=u= shalt knowe it 
by these sygnes. The bely wyll swell w~ payne & styfnesse 
in y=e= knees goynge a slowe pace. It behoueth to 
vse some subtyle & lyght meates/ as is sayd before w~ 
the gouernynge. And yf y=u= do not thus there wyl folowe 
ache in the hyppes/ in the mylte/ in the back/ and 
other ioyntes/ and in the lyuer/ w~ yll dygestyon. 
 
[}X. Of the fourth parte of the body.}] 
 
THe fourth p~te of the body be~ y~ genytours. yf superfluyte 
& noughty humoures gadre in the~ 
y=u= shalt knowe it by these sygnes. The appetyte wyl 
waxe colde/ & reednesse wyll appere vpo~ the~ & vpo~ y~ 
share. Tha~ must y=u= take a sede called Apij w~ fenell sede 
& y=e= rote of mugwort/ & of another called Acha~ & atracies. 
And w~ these herbes put y=e= rotes in good whyte 
wyne/ & drynke a qua~tyte of it euery mornyng w~ a lytell 
water & hony & eate not moche after it. And yf y=u= 
do not th~ y=u= shalt haue payne in y~ bladder/ & lyuer/ & 
shalte not pysse/ & shalt haue grefe in y=e= intrayles and 
lunges with brekynge of the stone. Swete sone Alexander 
I haue rede also the hystoryes of a myghty 
kynge/ whiche assembled all the best phylosophres 
[^f.F4v^] 
that were in ynde and Grece. And co~maunded them 
to make a medycyne so prouffytable that he sholde nede 
none other for his helth. The Grekes sayd he that 
drynketh euery morny~g twyse his mouthfull of warme 
water shall haue a good ende/ and shall nede none 
other medycyne. The physycyens of ynde sayd that 
it is good to eate euery day fastyng a qua~tyte of greynes 
of whyte hony. And me semeth that who so taketh 
one of these sayd medycynes by reason shall not 
haue payne in his wombe/ nor ought not to feare palsey/ 
nor gowte/ nor ache in his Ioyntes. And who so 
eateth euery mornynge .vij. dragmas of clustres of 
swete wyne grapes/ shall not feare y=e= dysease of flewme/ 
and it wyll amende his mynde/ and claryfy his 
vnderstandynge/ and he nedeth not to to doubt feuer 
quartaynes. And who so eateth in the mornynge a 
fygge with nuttes and a quantyte of leues of rue, y~ 
day shall not nede to feare venym. 
 
[}Of naturall heate.}] 
 
Moost myghty kynge I requyre the to study the 
maner to kepe the naturall heat of thy body/ with y~ 
moysture therof/ in the whiche two thynges lyeth 
the helthe of thy persone. And knowe thou that the 
destruccyon of the body cometh in two thynges/ one 
is naturall/ and the other agaynst nature. And for y~ contraryte 
of the complexyon of man/ and whan aege 
surmounteth y~ body it behoueth for to dye. Other 
wyse vnnaturally by adue~ture/ as by wepen/ or stones/ 
or by sykenesse and lacke of helpe/ or by venym/ 
and other chaunces. 
 
[}Of the qualytees of meates.}] 
 
Forthermore it is good that thou knowe the nature 
[^f.G1r^] 
of meates/ for some be~ grosse/ or cours/ & some ben 
lyght & subtyle. The subtyle bredeth thy~ne blode/ & 
good/ as pure wheate/ chekyns/ & new layde egges 
Grosse meates ben good for suche as ben of hote humours/ 
labourers/ fastyng/ and y~ slepe after meales. 
Meane meates bredeth no hote nor superfluous humours/ 
as the flesshe of lambes/ yo~ge porke/ & other 
that be~ hote and moyste/ but suche meates chaunge 
often in rostynge to hardnesse/ to heate/ and dryenesse 
And they ought to be eaten forthwith after the rosty~ge/ 
and ben good yf they be so taken w~ good spyces. 
Some meates brede melancoly/ as befe/ cowes flesshe/ 
and all flesshe that is cours and drye Other that 
brede and fede in moyst and watry/ & shadowy places 
ben more subtyle/ better and holsomest. 
 
[}Y. Of the nature of fysshe.}] 
 
Fysshes that ben of small substau~ce/ & thynne 
skynnes/ easy of eatynge/ bredde in rennynge 
waters nyghe the see be~ better & lyghter 
than they that bredde in y~ see or fresshe ryuers. 
But fysshe that bredeth in y~ see is holsomer tha~ 
fresshe ryuer fysshe. Therfore beware of fysshe of grete 
substaunce w~ harde skynnes for suche be~comynly 
venemous. 
 
[}A. Of the nature of waters.}] 
 
THou ought to knowe y~ clere re~nynge waters 
that ben nyghe to cytees in pure grounde as 
small brokes be the best and lyghtest. Water that cometh 
[^f.G1v^] 
out of stony erthe where as is moche fumosytees 
is heuy/ co~tagyous/noysom. Water of puddles 
or fenne full of frogges/ addres/ and other venymous 
wormes be vnholsom. The sygnes of good water is 
to be clere/ lyght/ & of good colour/ y~lyghtly dooth sethe 
and lyghtly coole. In suche waters nature delyteth 
salt. Water of y~ see is fymusshe and laxeth y~ wo~be/ 
& water of y~see is hote and heuy bycause it moeueth 
not/ & the sonne is dayly ouer it/ and it bredeth 
coler/ and creaseth the mylt and the lunges. The dry~kynge 
of waters with colde stomake fastynge afore 
dyner greueth the body/ and quencheth the heate 
of the stomake. But drynkynge of water after dyner 
warmeth the stomake and bredeth flewme. And moche 
of it corrupteth the meate in the stomake. Thou 
oughtest to drynke colde water in somer and warme 
water in wynter/ and not co~trary wyse. For warme 
water in somer mollyfyeth and weyketh the stomake/ 
and wasteth the appetyte. And in wynter colde 
water que~cheth the heate/ and destroyeth the instrumentes 
of the brest/ it noyeth the lyghtes and lu~ges 
and bredeth many greues. 
 
[}B. Of the nature of wyne.}] 
 
THe nature of wyne that groweth on mou~taynes 
nygh to y~ sonne is dryer tha~ that/ 
that groweth on the playne grounde/ in 
moyst places/ & shadowes wyne is good 
for aeged people/ and suche as be moyst & 
flewmy. And enoyeth them that be yonge and hote. 
And wyne warmeth & delyuereth colde and cours 
[^f.G2r^] 
superfluytees. The reeder and thycker that wyne is 
the more it bredeth blode. But yf it be stro~ge and bytter/ 
tha~ it is called the fyrst blode and the fyrst norysshyng/ 
and hath the nature of drynke and medycyne 
And often dronke~ it noyeth the body and nouryssheth 
it not. And wha~ wyne is naturally swete/ it noyeth 
the stomake with smellynges and wyndes/ but such 
wyne is comynly swete of co~plexion/ and suche as 
groweth in large feeldes stretcynge towarde the 
mountaynes and valees hauynge swete clustres/ & 
& rype/ and be not gathred tyll the myght of the substaunce 
of the bery is gone with the moystnesse/ and 
y~ the vyne and the grape be somwhat wydred. And 
thou shalt knowe that wyne ought to be of an eygre 
taste sharpe and pleasaunt/ and haue thycke lyes on 
the botome of the vessell/ and fayre and clere aboue & 
whan thou hast fayre and good wyne drynke temperatly 
therof y~ ease of thy body/ as the tyme requyreth. 
For it stre~gtheth the stomake and the heates of 
y~ body/ and helpeth dygestyon and kepeth frome corrupcyon/ 
and rypeth the meate in the membres/ puryfyeng 
it/ & worketh in the~ tyll it be co~iunct in good 
blode/ & nourysshynge/ and trauayleth & reyseth the 
heat of the body temperately. And kepeth a man sure 
if wycked humours/ it gladdeth the hert/ & maketh 
fresshe colour in the face. It quyckeneth the mynde & 
soupleth the to~gue/ & destroyeth all melancholy/ & make 
a man bolde/ & to have good courage & appetyte. 
And hath many other good propryetees. But yf wynne 
be outrageously take~ many inconuenyences come 
therby. It troubleth y=e= brayne/ y=e= mynde/ y=e= wyttes/ 
y~ vnderstondynge. It maketh the vertue of natural 
[^f.G2v^] 
heate wylde/ & causeth forgetfulnesse. It co~breth the 
to~gue & weyketh all y~ synewes & lymmes of y~ body. 
It maketh the eyes reed & blered. It chau~geth y~ colour/ 
& destroyeth y~ body/ & maketh cours & noughty 
blode. It marreth dygestyon. It causeth to many 
wordes/ & to muche slepe. It maketh y~ mouthe stynkynge. 
It letteth y~ goynge/ & dystroyeth y~ sede of ma~ 
& bredeth lepry. Beware therfore y~ thou drynke not 
wyne outrageously/ but moeue & change y~ nature 
therof w~ rewbarbe whiche causeth y~ lyuer to lyue. 
And wyne w~ Rubarbe hath many vertues as is fou~de 
playnly in bokes of physyke. Howbeit Rubarbe & 
wyne be bothe deedly veny~ yf they be outragyously 
take~. And surely all euyls cometh of wyne vnmeasurably 
dronken. 
 
[}C. Of goodnesse & harme y~ cometh of wyne.}] 
 
NOble kynge Alexa~der/ forgete not to take 
tarte syropes in y~ mornyng fastynge 
whan flewmatyke humours habou~de 
to moch. For it is proufytable & wasteth 
the~ moche. Also I meruayle y~ ony man 
may dye or be seke that eateth breed of clene and good 
wheat/ holsome & good flesshe/ & drynketh good wyne 
of grapes temp~atly. And yf he kepe hym fro to moche 
drynkyng/ eatyng/ & trauaile. yf sykenesse ouercome 
such a man he must be healed as a dronke~ man. 
That is to wyte he must be wasshed w~ warme water/ 
and tha~ set ouer a re~nyng water betwene .ii. grene 
wylowes/ & his stomake anoynted wan oy~teme~t 
of sandres/ or sandalles/ & haue a fumygacyo~ of fra~ke~se~ce: 
& other swete spyces/ & it wyll do hym moch good 
And yf ony ma~ wyll forsake holly y~ drynkyng of wyne/ 
[^f.G3r^] 
he ought not to leaue it sodeynly at ones but lytel 
& lytell/ & to me~gle it euery day w~ water more & more/ 
tyll at the last there be nothynge but clere water. 
And so he may kepe his helth & good co~plexyon. Th~ 
gouerne thy body yf thou wyll lyue longe. And kepe 
my doctrynes/ & consydre these thynges folowynge 
wherin nature conforteth gretely. That is to wyte. 
Goodly pastymes/ syght of grete rychesses/ grete reuerence/ 
vyctory ouer enemyes/fedyng on good meates/ 
noyse of mynstralsy/ syght of precyous garmentes/ 
often herynge of good tydynges past and to come/ and co~munycacyon 
with fayre gentylwomen.

[}Of the physonomy of people.}] 
 
AMonge all other thynges of this worlde 
I wyll that thou knowe a noble and meruaylous 
scye~ce that is called physonomy 
by the which thou shalt knowe the nature 
and condycyo~ of people. And it was fou~de 
by a phylosophre named Physonomyas/ the whiche 
sought the qualytees of the nature of creatures 
In the tyme of the sayde Physonomyas reygned 
the moost wyse physycye~ ypocras. And bycause the 
fame of physonomyas and his wysdome was so gretely 
spredde/ the dyscyples and seruantes of ypocras 
toke his fygure secretly/ and bare it to Physonomyas 
to here how he wolde Iuge and say by y~ sayd 
fygure of ypocras. And bade hym say and tel the qualyte 
therof. whan Physonomyas had well beholden 
it/ he sayd. This man is wrangeler lecherous and 
rude. This herynge the dyscyples of ypocras/ they 
wolde haue slayne Physonomyas/ and sayd to hym. 
Aa fole this is the fygure of the best man of the worlde. 
Wha~ Physononomyas sawe them thus moeued/ 
he appeased them the best waye that he coude with 
fayre wordes saynge. I knowe well that this is the 
fygure of the wyse ma~ ypocras. And I haue shewed 
you by scyence as I knowe. whan the dyscyples were 
come to ypocras they tolde hym what Physonomyas 
[^f.H4r^] 
had sayd. And ypocras sayd. Truely Physonomyas 
hath tolde you the trouthe/ and hath left no 
thynge of my complexyon in the whiche ben all my 
vyces. But reason that is in me ouercometh and ruleth 
the vyces of my complexyon. Dere sone I haue 
shortely abreged to the/ the rules of this scyence 
of Physonomy/ the whiche shall infourme the gretely. 
yf thou se a man with salowe coloure/ flee his 
company/ for he is inclyued to the synne of lechery/ 
and to many euylles. yf thou seest a man that smyleth 
lyghtly/ and whan thou beholdest hym he wyll 
loke shamfastly and wyl blusshe in his face and sygh/ 
with teeres in his eyes yf thou blame hym for ony 
thynge/ surely he feareth the and loueth thy persone 
Beware of hym as thy enmy that is tokened in his 
face/ and hym also that is mysshapen. The best co~plexyon 
that is/ is he that is of meane coloure with 
browne eyes & heere/ and his vysage betwene why 
and reed/ with an vpryght body/ with a heed of metely 
bygnesse/ and that speketh not but of nede be/ w~ 
a softe voyce/ suche a complexyon is good/ and suche 
men haue about the. yf the heeres be playne and 
smothe the man is curteys and meke/ and his brayne 
is colde. Harde heere and curled is a token of foly & 
lewdnesse. Moche heere on the brest and on the bely 
betokeneth very yll or very good complexyo~ naturally 
and is very amerous/ and kepeth in his herte the 
iniuryes y~ hath be~ done to hym. Blacke heere betokeneth 
to loue reason & Iustyce. Duskysshe eyes betokeneth 
fooly/ & lyghtly to be angry. Gray eyes betokeneth 
honeste/ & louy~ge peas. Bygge eyes betokeneth 
to be~ enuyo~/ vnshamefast/ slowe & vnobedye~t. 
[^f.H4v^] 
Eyes meane betwene blacke and yelowe is of good 
vnderstandyng/ curteys/ and trusty. Wyde retchynge 
eyes and a longe face betokeneth a ma~ malycyo~ 
and yll. Eyes lyke an asse alway lokyng downe is of 
harde nature and nought. waueryng eyes with a lo~ 
face betokeneth gyle/ rennynge mynde and vntrusty 
Reed eyes betokeneth to be stro~ge and of a grete courage. 
He that hath spekles about his eyes/ whyte/ 
blacke/ or reed/ is the worst of all other men. Thycke 
heered eye lyddes is an yll speker/ he that hath them 
hangynge longe to his eyes/ is neyther true nor clene. 
He that hath heere ynough bytwene his two browes 
and be thyn~e and not to longe/ is of a good and 
grete vnderstandyng. A sklendre nosed man is soone 
angry. A longe nose hawked to the mouthe/ is a 
toke~ of honeste and hardynesse A snytted nose is a token 
to be soone vexed. wyde nosethrylles in a man is 
slouth and boystousnesse and soone angered. A brode 
nose in the myddes is a grete speker/and a lyer. But 
y~ best is he that is meane neyther to wyde nor to close. 
The vysage that is ful & flat/ and that is not swollen 
nor to bygge is a token of an yll persone/ enuyo~/ 
iniuryous /and a wra~geler. But he that hath a meane 
vysage of fourme of chekes and eyes/ neyther to 
fat nor to leane/ he is trusty/ louynge/ and of grete vnderstaudynge/ 
wyse and full of seruyce and wytte. 
He that hath a wyde mouthe loueth batayle and 
is hardy. He y~ hath thycke lyppes is folysshe. And he 
that hath a wrynkled face is a lyer/ and careth not of 
many debates. He that hath a sklender face is of grete 
reason. He that hath a lytell vysage and yelowe of 
colour is deceyuer/ dronken/ and euyll. Full eyes & 
[^f.I1r^] 
smothe chekes is soone angry. Small eeres betokeneth 
foly/ and lechery. He that hath a small voyce 
& speketh thycke loueth feyghtynge. He that hath 
a meane voyce/ neyther to bygge/ nor to lytell/ is folysshe 
and vnreasonable. And he that speketh to moche 
with a sklender voyce/ is not ouer honest/ and of 
smal care. He that hath a femynyne voyce is soone angry/ 
and of yl nature. A softe voyced man is often angry 
and e~uyous. He that hath a fayre voyce/ is folysshe/ 
and of hyghe courage. He that speketh lyghtly/ 
lyeth often/ and is a deceyuer. And he that speketh w~out 
moeuynge his handes/ is of grete wysdome and 
honeste. He that hath a sklender necke/ is hote/ deceytfull/ 
and folysshe. He y~ hath a grete bely is proude/ 
lecherous/ and vnwyse. He that hath a large 
brest/ thycke sholdres/ and bygge fyngers/ is hardy/ 
wyse/ gentyll/ and of good wytte. He with a sklender 
backe agreeth neuer with ony other. He y~ hath his 
brest & backe egall/ is a token of honeste. Hye reysed 
sholdres/ is a toke~ of lytell fydelyte/ nought/ and sharpe. 
He that hath longe armes rechynge to the knee/ 
is of grete boldenesse/ sadnesse/ & lyberalyte. Shorte 
armes betoken that he loueth socour/ and is folysshe. 
Longe palmed handes with longe fyngers/ is ordeyned 
to lerne many scye~ces/ and artes/ and specyal 
handy craftes/ and be of good gouernau~ce. Fyngers 
short and thycke/ betoken foly. Shorte thycke fete 
and flesshy/ betokeneth to be folysshe/ and full of iniury. 
A lytell lyght fote/ is a man of smal vnderstandynge. 
A sklender fote sheweth a man to be symple/ and 
of small knowlege. He that hath a thycke fote is hardy 
and folysshe. The length of y~ legges/ & the heles 
[^f.I1v^] 
betoken strength of the body. A thycke flesshy kne/ is 
soft and weyke. A man that gooth a grete pace/ is 
wyllynge in all thynges/ and to hasty. He is of a 
good nature and complexyon/ that hath softe flesshe 
and moyst/ meanely smothe and rough/ and that is 
kyndly betwene reed and whyte. He that hath a 
smothe contenaunce/ softe heere & playne/ with meane 
eyes of bygnesse/ with a well proporcyoned heed/ 
a good necke and suffycyent in length/ with sholders 
somdele lowe/ and his legges and knees metely flesshed/ 
his voyce competent clere/ y~ palmes of his handes 
and fyngers longe/ and not thycke/ and that he 
laughe but lytell/ and that is no mocker/ with a smylyng/ 
chere and mery/ is of good co~plexyon. Howbeit 
dere sone I commaunde the not to Iuge al vpon one 
sygne/ but consydre all the tokens of a man whiche 
moost habounde and sheweth y=e= foly in hym/ and holde 
the to the best and moost prouffytable party.
