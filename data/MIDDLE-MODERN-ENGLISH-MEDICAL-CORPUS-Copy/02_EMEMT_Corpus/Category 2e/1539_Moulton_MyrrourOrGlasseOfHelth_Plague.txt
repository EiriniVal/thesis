[^f.A7r^] 
[}Here begynneth the fyrst 
parte of this booke that sheweth dyuers 
causes how the pestilence 
may be gendred. 
Cap. i.}] 
 
COnsidering that this treatyse, 
is very nedefull and 
necessary against the syckenesse 
of y=e= Pestile~ce. And 
for a comon welth and health of the 
kynges lyege people: I Thomas 
Moulton doctour of diuinitie, of the 
order of y=e= Frere preachers, the which 
for to gather moueth me for dyuers 
causes. The one is prayers of myne 
owne brethren. 
 
Another is cause of prayers of 
many worthy gentyles. 
And another is compassion that I 
haue of the poore people, that was & 
is destrayed euery day therby for defaute 
of helpe. 
 
[^f.A7v^] 
And the fourth cause that moued 
me moste of all pure conscience, for 
euery christen man and woman, is 
bounde by the lawe of conscience, & 
they knowe theyr euen christen in 
great peryll or that is lykely to fall 
to great myschyefe to helpe them if 
he may by hys wytte with his trauayle, 
and with his goodes. And 
these foure causes moued me to compounde 
and to gather this treatyse, 
and to set it in printe so in Englysh 
that euery man both lerned, & lewde 
ryche and pore may the better vnderstande 
it, and do thereafter. And so 
euery man woman, and chylde, to 
be theyr owne phisycion in tyme of 
nede, against the vengeaunce and corrupcion 
of the pestylence that nowe 
is reygnyng with other diseases many 
mo, and this treatyse for the pestylence 
is deuyded and parted, in 
thre partes and consequently ensueth 
[^f.A8r^] 
the, seuen dayes with the planettes 
with the natures and exposicions 
of the .xii. sygnes deuyded by the .xii. 
monethes of the yeare, with the remedies 
for many dyuers other diseases 
that hurteth and greueth the body 
of man. 
 
And the first part of this boke telleth 
dyuerse causes howe the pestylence 
may be gendred. 
 
The seconde parte telleth howe 
man, woman, and chylde, shall preserue 
& kepe them selfes from the pestilence, 
if so that ma~ woma~, or child, 
be curable that falleth therin. 
 
The thyrd part telleth the remedy, 
helpe & medicine against y=e= pestile~ce. 
 
The fyrst part I saye of this treatyse 
as I tolde, be shewed dyuerse 
causes, whiche may be the grounde 
of this Pestylence, that nowe raygneth. 
I fynde by the treatynge of 
foure Doctours, the foure pillers y=t= 
[^f.A8v^] 
vpholdeth holy churche. That is to 
say, s. Austin, s. Ierome, s. Gregory & 
s. Ambrose, where they speke of this 
matter, they say that synne that rayneth 
among the people. And namely 
that synne that reygneth amo~g headme~. 
And the gouerners of the church 
and of the lawe, is cause of the Pestilence, 
vengeaunce taken for Synne. 
Hereof I fynde insample, and fygure 
in holy wryte. In the seconde 
boke of kynges, in the .xxiii. Chapiter. 
There sheweth holy wryte openly, 
that for the sinne of king Dauid 
God sent vnto him his prophete, and 
gaue him choise of thre thinges, whether 
that he had leuer that GOD 
should sende vpon hym for his sinne 
and of his people, hunger seuen yere 
or elles he had leuer that he shoulde 
sende vpon hym pursuyt of enemies, 
and to be ouercome of them, thre monethes, 
or yet that he had leuer that 
[^f.B1r^] 
he should sende vpon him Pestilence 
thre dayes and thre nightes. And tha~ 
kyng Dauid truly choose pestilence, 
so that from that tyme that he had 
chosen thus pestyle~ce, or it was none 
of the day, there was dead .xxvii. thousand 
of his people. And than kynge 
Dauid sawe that vengeaunce was 
taken for his synne, by Pestylence, 
mournyngly with great sorowe and 
great compassion of herte, he cryed 
God almyghty mercy. And whan he 
had done, anone the pestile~ce seaced. 
 
Also for synne that reigned in the 
people hydous pestylence hath bene 
taken as was showed on Hierusale~ 
as telleth vince~t in speculo historiali 
and Eusebius telleth the same. Therfore 
euery ma~ in what degre or what 
state he be put away synne through 
hertely sorowe, and very contrycion 
askyng of god mekely mercy and forgeuenes 
entierly w=t= Christ of mouth 
[^f.B1v^] 
and satisfaction doyng penau~ce for 
his sinnes, then he putteth away the 
cause of pestylence that in case is ve~geaunce 
taken for synne. And sothely 
sauyng we ought not to deme lyghtly 
of goddes preuites, this maye 
be wel one cause of this hydeous pestylence 
that now is reygnyng. 
 
And they saye generally in this realme, 
and south it is that many tokens 
are shewed that men lykely deme 
that syn is cause in part of this pestilence, 
as the corrupt ayre & the venyme 
therof the whiche was caused 
by a coniunccion of Saturne & Iouis 
the whiche planettes their workyng 
within few yeares, and the malyce 
of the coniunccio~ & of other syn, 
this left in the ayre and beneth, the 
which malyce & venym hath his respect 
and his influe~ce more in the conplexio~ 
of man tha~ of beast, inasmuch 
as the working of the coniunccion, & 
[^f.B2r^] 
of other synne was more principally 
in the syn of mankynd than in the sin 
of another maner of beast. But the 
workyng of other coniunccions dyuers 
are before hande, had their workyng 
in the signes of other beastes & 
their influe~ce in y=e= co~plexio~s of them. 
 
And therfore the malyce of the coniunccio~s 
was cause why that the moren 
fell of suche beastes more than of 
other that time. But thys coniunccio~ 
aforesayd, the whiche was wrought 
more princypally in the synne of mankynde 
more than of any other whose 
venym and malyce yet reygnyng, is 
the cause of the corrupcion of the 
ayre, the which ayre corrupt is cause 
of the pestylence that nowe is reignyng, 
but neuertheles if so be that it 
be impossyble by all Phylosophers, 
that the Element of the ayre should 
in his owne kynde, and in his owne 
substaunce be corrupt or elles infect. 
[^f.B2v^] 
sythen it is symple and cleane is his 
substaunce wrought without any venome 
or corruption. Neuertheles yet 
by the waye of vaporous fumosities 
and humours the which that are corrupt 
and drawen from the earth beneth 
by vertue At tractyfe of the bodies 
that ben aboue, and mengyd w=t= 
the ayre so by Accidental cause is the 
ayre corrupt & in parte cause of this 
pestyle~ce. But than thou mayst meue 
against me, and say that if so were y=t= 
the venemous ayre, and the corrupcion 
therof, should be cause of pestilence, 
or elles man, woma~ and chyld 
shuld be infect thereby, that it semeth 
euery man, woman, & chylde, should 
be infect & corrupt by the pestilence. 
In the cou~trey there the ayre corrupt 
is reignyng, sythen the ayre in such a 
place is common to all maner of me~. 
To this aunswered Auicen in his ca~non 
in the part there he treteth De 
[^f.B3r^] 
cura februm: that if al the pestylence 
ayre be reygnyng in a countrey, and 
if it be common to all the inhabitau~tes 
of that country, yet there shall 
none be infect there with, but they y=t= 
be replet and ful of corrupt humours 
the whiche corrupte humours haue 
their respect and accordyng to receyue 
the corrupcion and the venym of 
the ayre els in what contrey, or city 
that such ayre were corrupt or venomed. 
In al maner of men that receyueth 
that ayre in the same countrey, 
or in the same cytie should be venemed 
and dead thereby, ye se well and 
knowe well, that the Element of the 
fyer, hath no predomination nor wil 
not bren but mather that is Conbustible, 
and accordyng to receyue fyre. 
On the same wyse the Element of 
the ayre that is pestylence corrupte 
infecteth neyther man, woman nor 
chylde, but suche as haue such venemyd 
[^f.B3v^] 
& corrupt humours within themselfe 
disposed to the same, the Pestylence 
therof in suche tyme that suche 
pestylence ayre reygneth in. 
 
After dyuersytye of venemous humours 
and corrupcion in men reygnyng. 
And through the workyng 
of that venemous pestylence ayre or 
dyuers syckenes and perelous gendred 
in man, woman and chyld. And 
this alteracyon in kynde is wrought 
by the malice and influence of the co~iunccion 
aforesayde, the whiche malyce 
of coniunccion, is lykely to bee 
cause of many other wonderfull alteracions 
betwxit kynge and kynge, 
lorde and lorde, man and man woma~ 
and woman, father and son, brother 
and brother, and many other. Also it 
is lykely to be cause of deposyng of 
lordes out of lordeshyppes and inhaunsynge 
and inhyghyng of knaues. 
And emperours of myghty men 
[^f.B4r^] 
spoylyng and destroyng of kyngdomes 
and lordshyppes. Also it is lykely 
to be cause of greatte fiers greatte 
mystes, & great waters by land. And 
cause of many great peryls by y=e= sea. 
 
Also it is likely to be cause of many 
wonderfull tokenynges of great 
wyndes and many other wonderfull 
thinges. Also destroyng of many sectes, 
and principally of the Sarasins 
secte, and of many other wonderfull 
syckenes. Also the Sismy of holy 
churche is lykely to ceise and dyuers 
states to end, & therw=t= many thinges 
is likely to fal by the iugement of astronomy, 
the whiche I wil not writ 
for dyuers causes. But knowe it 
well all maner of menne, that these 
thynges, I reherse not as thynges 
tolde by prophesy, but as conclusio~s 
folowynge and shewed hy Astronomy, 
and also by astrolagy, for as declareth 
Ipocras in his booke that 
[^f.B4v^] 
he made (De Epidimia) there shall 
neuer physition be true in workyng 
ne sure practisor of physike, but he 
worke & practyse by rules of Astronomye 
for Ipocras sayth that it is 
impossyble that a man shall cure a 
syckenes but if he knowe the cause 
of his sycknes, there is some syckenes 
y=t= is caused by mouynge & working 
of the bodies aboue, y=e= which a 
man may not know w=t=out Astronomy 
and Astrology tha~ it semeth wel 
that it is impossible to a man to cure 
sickenes generally, but he can of Astronomy 
and of Astrology. For as 
I fynde in libro Interprecationum 
al the foure Eleme~tes, and al other 
thynges, beneth that bene compou~d 
of them are gendred by the course of 
the planettes aboue. And all the lyuely 
bodies beneth haue iu part, ther 
being their heale, and their syckenes 
by the mouyng of the bodies aboue. 
 
[^f.B5r^] 
Thus endeth the fyrst part of this 
pestylence treatyse. 
 
[}Here foloweth the seco~d part that 
showeth how man should preserue 
and kepe hym from 
the Pestylence. 
Cap. ii.}] 
 
THe second part of this treatyse, 
is howe thou shalt gouerne 
and preserue thy selfe from the 
malice of the pestylence ayre, and 
from the venym and corrupcion that 
is gendred therby. The whyche partye 
is princypall cause of this pestyle~ce 
that now is reygnyng. The fyrst 
and the principall preseruacion there 
agaynst is this. To gouerne y=e= well 
and wysely and for to flye al that 
may gendre any Feuer or ague. First 
thou nedeth to kepe the seuerally fro~ 
all maner of excesse and outrage of 
meate and drinke, and namely from 
[^f.B5v^] 
all maner of feuores meates, as 
Gose, Douebyrdes, Malardes, Uenyson, 
Lampraye, Scate and Elis. 
And also other feuores meates, eate 
no great meate no vnnyons, nor lykes 
nor garlyke nor no fruyte. For 
all these gathereth and engendreth 
vnkyndely heates and so bryngeth a 
man to an agu, and he be in anywise 
of night dispositio~ therto. And vse no 
bathes nor stues swete not to much 
for all openeth the pores of a mans 
body and maketh the venemous 
ayre to enter, and for to infecte the 
bloud & the spiritual me~bres of man 
and for to destroye al lyuely spirites 
in man. Also kepe the from haunting 
of Lechery, for that both openeth 
the pores and destroyeth the kynde 
naturall. And also infebleth the spirituall 
membres, and the lyuely spirites 
of man 
 
Also in the tyme of pestilence in no 
[^f.B6r^] 
wyse suffer to great thruste, and yf 
thou thrust, loke thou drynke but mesurably, 
and not but for to slaken thy 
thrust and namely suche drynkes as 
wyll abate thy heate as is Tysan water 
mengeled with vyneger or water 
of Borage, water of Letuse, water 
of Roses, water of Scabyous, water 
of Turmentyll, water of Diten 
myngled in euen proporcion or elles 
by them selfe. For these drinkes yf 
the pestylence reigne in the heate of 
the Somer ben profitable, and soueraynly 
to them that ben Colyrike of 
co~plexion. For they be hoter & drier 
then other. Also to slepe on after nones 
& whan thou shalt go to bed, shyt 
thy dores and thy wyndowes close. 
and in an earthen panfull of Charcole 
fyer caste this powder made of 
these thynges of Lorell leuys dryed, 
Rosemary dryed and Frankensence, 
of eche of the~ a lyke much & cast halfe 
[^f.B6v^] 
a sponeful of this powred in the fyer 
 
Also vse fyer in thy chamber all 
the times of the day and of the night 
of these thinges as fier of Ienoper & 
if y=t= may not get this Ienoper make 
the fier of clene drye Aschewode, and 
vse to case in the fyer alwaye, frankensens, 
Storax, Calamint, Lapdanum, 
and the fumosyties of these and 
the smoke, if the ayre be corrupt of y=e= 
vertu Attractiue of the lyuely spyrites, 
and the spyritual members out 
warde by the vaynes of the hert, and 
so inuenomes it and these hasteth a 
man to his death. But if the nature 
of the pestilence be gendred betwyxt 
the thygh and the body, it is a tokenyng 
that it commeth from infection 
of the lyuer, and tha~ if the matter appere 
in the scher besyde the preuy me~bers 
blede on the fote in the same syde, 
on the vayne that is betwixte thy 
great too, and the next too, for if the 
[^f.B7r^] 
botche be drawing thether And thou 
blede on the arme the matter tha~ wil 
draw vp agayne to the lyuer, and so 
to the harte, & that is perillous. And 
if the botche be more out ward to the 
syde and fetther from the preuy members, 
blede the~ on the vayne betwene 
the ankle and the fote, and the hele, 
or els on the vayne that is vnder the 
ankle that is called the Sopheme: or 
els loke that thou be sone ventused 
with a ve~tosing best beneth y=e= botche 
but that is very paynful. Neuertheles 
in case that the vayne may not be 
taken, or els that the vayne may not 
blede, it must nedes be suffred, in such 
peryll may thou be. If the matter appere 
in the clensing place of the head 
consyder well on what syde it appereth, 
and blede on the vayne, or on 
the arme, the which vayne lyeth next 
the Cardyacle, the whiche Cardiacle 
lieth in the middes of the arme right 
[^f.B7v^] 
in the bouthe of the arme, or els blede 
on the vayne that is on the hande, 
that is betwyxte the thombe and the 
nexte fynger, or els be ventosed betwyxt 
the shoulders. But take good 
hede, that whan some euer thou haste 
blede of anye of these vaynes, take 
good hede that thou slepe not after 
thy bloude lettyng of .xiii. houres. If 
thou be ryche and may well spende. 
than it were good to haue this Pome 
Ambre euermore in thy hande, 
holde it to thy nose that thou may receyue 
the sauer and smel thereof for 
comfortyng of thy brayne (and of all 
other Spritual membres the which 
thou shalt make thus. Take Lapdanum 
puryd an ounce storax Calamyte 
dysolued, Roses, Cloues, Maces 
of eche one thre half peny weight 
and make them in pouder that ought 
to be made in pouder, and fyue sponefull 
of oyle debay, an once of virgyn 
[^f.B8r^] 
wax and dissolue them. And when 
they be dyssolued: put all together & 
mengle them well vnto they be colde 
and make thereof a ball the quantitie 
of a wall nutte: and that is called 
the Pome ambre, the sent or the 
smell therof, wyll comforte the lyuely 
spyrytes in manne, and if thou rule 
the thus as I haue taught y~, thou 
may hy the grace of god and by thys 
gouernaunce preserue thy selfe from 
the pestilence. 
 
Thus endeth the sencond part of 
the pestylence treatyse. 
 
[}And here foloweth the thyrde parte 
that sheweth, and a man be taken 
with the pestilence what remedy and 
medecyne is best therfore. cap. iii.}] 
 
HEre the third part of this treatyse 
telleth what is agaynste 
this syckenes of the pestilence that 
reigneth amo~g the people, and what 
medycyne is best therefore. Auicen 
[^f.B8v^] 
in his Canon on the part, there he 
treateth De dura februm, there is no 
sycknes that falleth in kind but ther 
is medycyne in kynde for in. Therefore 
if so be it be taken in dew tyme, 
than if thou shalt fall into this syckenes 
loke that thou be letten bloud as 
I haue tolde. And if there be any feuer, 
or any ague annexed therto and 
the corrupt blode be drawen away, 
on this bleding as I haue told. (And 
the pryncypall membres ventused) 
the hart ought them to be comforted 
with good Letwares or with cold water 
stylled, the whiche Letewaris be 
these that wyll wythdraw vnkyndely 
hetis, as conserue of vyoletes conserue 
of Borage, co~serue of Buglos 
drawen with suger decoct with water 
of Turmentil, water of Endiue 
water of Roses, water of Borage, 
myngled by euen porcions. And the~ 
take these euery daye, & euery houre 
[^f.C1r^] 
of the day, with water of turmentyll, 
water of Scabious, water of Uiolettes, 
or els water of Endyue. 
 
Also it were nedefull to haue this 
water distylled of these herbes of Detyne, 
of Scabious, of Turmentil, of 
Vyolettes, of Endyue, and Letyse, & 
for to drynke these myngled wyth 
whyte wyne of gascan, or els of Rochel 
wyne, and namely the whyles y=e= 
vnkyndly heate reygneth. 
 
Also it were nedefull to haue water 
of Roses, and of Byttayne, to 
washe thy temples with all, and thy 
pulse withal of thy arme & thy ha~des 
 
And also it were nedeful to take of 
the last, that is to say of Rose, and of 
Betane, and put therof in a saucer 
of pewter, or in a syluer pece, & chaufe 
it a lytell, and lape a linnem cloth .iiii 
folde and wete it therein. And the 
whyle thou art in the great beate of 
the ague lay the linnem cloth wete in 
[^f.C1v^] 
the water vpon thy temples, and vpo~ 
thy forhead, and another vpon thy 
lyuer. Take also two other clothes 
lapped and wete on the same wyse, 
and lay in euery arme hole one. And 
this practysyng shall doo the great 
ease whether thou be curable & shall 
lyue or vncurable and shall dye. 
 
But the moste nedefull thynge of 
al if so be that this apere in any wyse 
aforesayde, is for to drawe the botch 
by craft away fro~ the clensyng place 
a great space from the hart. And that 
shal I tell the how, and in al my practysyng 
in physyke this .xviii. yeare, I 
wyste it neuer fall but twyse & that 
was not long of the medecyne. And 
one other time but of other defautes 
the whiche I will not wryte at this 
tyme, though it wyl expel and woyde 
it. And loke in the tyme of pestylence 
that they codmares be alway freshly 
washen and after the washing, loke 
[^f.C2r^] 
that they be dypped in the fyne water 
of Roses, and on the same wyse the 
kertchefe that thou lappest thy head 
in one nyghtes and let it drye by the 
fyer: and not by the pestylence ayre. 
And when thou layest the downe to 
slepe, lay vnder thy head and vnder 
the ende of the pyllowe that is towarde 
thy vysage, Rosemary, Isope 
Souerayne myntes, Perial rial, Lorel 
leues, put in thy mouthe Mases, 
and Cloues, or els Nutmigges, loke 
euery day that thou take of fyne triacle 
proued the quantite of a bene and 
a halfe. Also beare in thy purse these 
maner of spyces, Maces, Clowes 
Quybybes; Canell: or elles Cynamon, 
and chewe therof, and eate therof 
all the tymes of the daye. 
 
And if thou be a pore manne and 
maye not intende too the costes of 
these thynges. Take then euerye 
daye fastynge nyne syppes in fyne 
[^f.C2v^] 
vyneger of whyte wyne, or elles of 
read wyne, and drinke to them a saucer 
full of vyneger, or thou passe out 
of thy house of place. 
 
Also one of the beste gouernaunce 
of all is in bloode lettyng: for thou 
shalt vnderstande that a man is in 
spirituall members pryncypall, that 
is for to saye the hart, the lyuer, and 
the brayne, & euery one of these hath 
his place geuen him by kynde by the 
whiche he may auoyde all suche superfluyties, 
and cleare hym selfe. 
 
The herte hath his clensyng place 
in the arme houle 
 
The clensyng place of the liuer is 
betwyxt the thyghe and the body. 
The clensing place of the Brayne 
is vnder the eares of the eares rotes 
and in the throte. 
 
Then this syckenes of the pestylence 
commeth thus: whan the pores 
of a man are open, then firste entreth 
[^f.C3r^] 
the venemous and the corrupt ayre, 
and as soone as it hath maystry and 
mengled with mannes bloude, than 
runneth it to the harte that is rote & 
grounde of mans lyfe, for to destroye 
mankynde, and for to infect and destroye 
all lyuely spirites in a man, & 
so fynally for to kyll and sle him, but 
the harte and the clene bloude flyeth 
all that is noyous and contraryous 
vnto kynde. And in asmuche as in 
hym is expelled all such maner of corrupcion 
and venemous from him to 
his clensyng place to thi arme hole: 
But than for that place is sometime 
stopped that it may not out, and it 
passeth than to the pryncypall member 
next y=e= is the lyuer for to destroye 
it. And then it doth as the harte doth 
in his kynde, and expelleth it from 
hym to his clensyng place betwyxte 
the thyghe and the body, for it is also 
spared in case and stopped it maye 
[^f.C3v^] 
not out but passeth the meates and 
the vaynes vnto the thyrd principal 
membre that is the braine but then 
he woulde expell it to his clensyng 
place that is vnder the eares, and it 
may not in case out therfore the stoppyng 
and the sparyng of the meates 
and pores and for thyckenes of the 
fowle and corrupt blode, and the venemous 
mater is mouyng that is 
myngled therewith, and thus long 
tyme the mater is mouyng or it resteth 
in any place some tyme twelue 
houres, and sometime .xxiiii. houres, 
and sometime more & sometime lesse 
after the degre & the gentylnes, & the 
greatnes af the sickenes corrupcio~s

then at the last so~tyme within .xxiiii. 
houres it passeth not out of y=e= cle~sing

groundeth hym euermore and setteth 
hym on a vayne, & letteth the bloud 
than that it may not haue his kyndly 
course by the vayne as he should

all the pryncypall & spiritual members 
are infect, and thus sleeth man. 
 
Thus endeth the thyrde part of 
this pestilenre treatyse. And hereafter 
foloweth the .vii. dayes with the
