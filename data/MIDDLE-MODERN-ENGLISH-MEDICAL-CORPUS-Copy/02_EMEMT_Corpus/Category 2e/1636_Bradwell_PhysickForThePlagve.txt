[}PHYSICK 
FOR 
THE SICKNESSE.}] 
 
[/1./] 
THe word Plague in 
English, signifieth, A 
Sharpe Punishment of 
what kind soever. As 
we may reade many 
were the Plagues inflicted 
on the Egyptians: 
and some of us in 
Indignatio~ wil threaten 
to plague those 
that highly offend us. 
But it is usually and most properly taken for that 
dreadfull affliction which in Latin is called Pestis, 
or Pestilentia; in Greeke [^GREEK OMITTED^], which signifies A 
Deadly Fretting, and it is the same with [^GREEK OMITTED^] a 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], quod efficiat Defectum Hominum. Or [^GREEK OMITTED^], 
Pernities seu Exitium. Hippocrates gives it a name 
of distinction, calling it [^GREEK OMITTED^], Morbus 
Communis, a Common or popular Disease. 
 
[/2./] 
But we must understand that there are two sorts 
[^p.2^] 
of Plagues that be Epidemicall. Viz. A Simple, and 
a Putrid Plague. 
 
[/3./] 
The Simple Plague, is The very Influence of the 
striking Angell executing the vengeance of God upon 
[/4./] 
the Bodies of Men. This kind of Plague ariseth from 
no distemper of Blood, putrifaction of Humors, 
or influence of Starres; but falleth meerely from 
the immediate stroke of Gods punishing Angell 
(Such were the Plagues, Exod. 12 Num. 11. 16. 25. 
Also, 2 Sam. 24. and 2 Kings, 19.) whereof some 
dye suddenly without any precedent complaint 
or conceit of Infection. Others againe, though 
they be sicke before they dye; yet their first taking 
hath beene after an extraordinary manner. 
For I observed in the last great Plague heere in 
London, (Anno 1625.) That some felt themselves 
manifestly stricken, being sensible of a blow suddainly 
given them, on the Head, necke, backe, or 
side: Sometime so violently, that they have been 
eyther almost, or altogether over-turned: and after 
these and such like stroakes some have dyed, 
and those that recovered, escaped without humane 
helpe: For this kind of Plague, as it is rare, so 
it is also by all Art of Man incurable. Therefore 
[/5./] 
no Method but Repentance, no Medicine but 
Prayer, can avert, or heale this stroake: Of all 
Antidotes for the Body, that Triacle which is made 
of the Flesh of earthly Serpents, is the best esteemed. 
But for the Soule, that only which is made of 
the Bloud of that Brazen Serpent that was lifted vp 
on the Crosse for our sinnes. Hee that by a lively 
Faith applyeth the benefit of our Blessed SAVIOURS 
[^p.3^] 
Sufferings to the sicknesse of his Soule, 
shall undoubtedly recover (if not health here) 
heaven hereafter. 
 
[/6./] 
The Putrid Plague, is a Popular Feavor venemous 
and Infectious, striking chiefly at the Heart, and 
for the most part is accompanied with some Swelling, 
which is eyther called a Blayne, a Botch or a Carbuncle, 
or else with Spots called GODS Tokens. This 
comes of Putrifaction of the Bloud and Humors 
in the Body, which it pleaseth God sometimes to 
make the Instrument of his punishing Iustice, 
mixing it with the Simple Plague before mentioned. 
 
[/7./] 
This Putrifaction may be caused by the Influence 
of the Starres, who doe undoubtedly worke 
upon all sublunarie bodies. For Astrologers are 
of opinion, that if Saturne and Mars have dominion 
[/8./] 
(especially under Aries, Sagitarius, and Capricorn,) 
a Pestilence is shortly to be expected. 
Or if these two (the most Malevolent) be in Opposition 
to the gentle Planet Iupiter; as the Poet 
singeth: 
Cælitus imbuitur tabe difflatilis aura 
Mars quando obijcitur Falcitenensq; Iovi. 
 
[/9./] 
The Windes likewise are led into theyr motions 
by the motions of the Starres; The Planets 
(especially the Sunne) by extracting the earths exhalations 
(which are the substance of the Winds) 
doe set them so on worke. And the Windes are 
some by nature wholsome, and some unwholsome. 
The South-wind blowing from the Meridian 
[^p.4^] 
is of nature hot and moyst, and full of showers. 
Now when by the influence of the Planets 
this Wind bloweth long and bringeth continuall 
raine, it causeth much moysture in all Airie and 
Earthy bodies, and so much the more by how 
much the milder it is. This moysture being in 
such abundance cannot be digested nor attenuated 
by the Sunnes heat; and therefore setling together 
it must needs putrifie; and that so much the sooner, 
because the heate of the Sunne (not being able 
to extract all) does inflame the remnant, by which 
inflamation the putrifaction becomes the greater. 
In this manner are the windes in cause: and moreover 
they doe sometimes transferre the Contagion 
from one region to another; as Hippocrates affirmes 
the Plague to be brought over the Sea from 
Æthiopia into Greece, by the South-wind. 
 
[/10./] 
Now if the Starres be pestilently bent against us, 
neyther Arts nor Armes, Perfumes nor Prayers, can 
prevaile with them, who have neyther pitie nor 
sense, nor power to alter their appointed motions. 
But Hee that commandeth their course, and 
altereth them at his pleasure: Hee that made the 
Sunne and Moone to stand still for Iosuah, yea drew 
the Sunne tenne degrees backe for Hezekiah, and 
caused the Starres to fight in their courses against 
Sisera. He, and He onely is able to heale all infections 
that can arise from their influences. The 
Cure of this Cause therefore is the same with the 
former. 
 
[/11./] 
Other Causes there be also of this Putrid Plague. 
Namely, corrupt and unwholsome Feeding, stenches 
[^p.5^] 
of unsavorie and rotten Dung-hils, Vaults, 
Sinckes, Ditches and dead Carions; as the Poet 
affirmes; 
Corpora fæda iacent, vitiantur adoribus auræ. 
These are the Maintaining Causes of the Contagion 
after it is begun. So is likewise the unseasonablenesse 
of the Weather: Quum tempestiva intempestive 
redduntur: as sayth Hippocrates, When the 
weather is unseasonable for the season of the 
yeare; being hot when it should be cold, moyst 
when it should be dry: and on the contrary. 
 
This kind of Plague is by Art curable in as many 
as it pleaseth GOD to send and sanctifie the 
right meanes unto. 
 
[/12./] 
The former is most properly called The Plague, 
being the immediate Stroke of Gods hand. This, 
The Sicknesse, because infectious, and many times 
Curable. 
 
For this therefore doe I intend to prescribe a 
course of Physicke, such as both my much reading, 
and also my manifest Experience in the last 
great Visitation, have preferred to my best approbation. 
 
[/13./] 
Wherein I will first open the way of Preservation, 
after that, shew the Signes of being Infected, 
and then the Course of Cure. 
 
[/14./] 
In the way of Preservation, it is first necessary 
to be considered, whether it be Infectious or no: 
And then who are most or least subject (according 
to naturall reason) to receive this Infection. 
[/15./] 
 
This Putrid Plague, is (as I have sayd in the 
[^p.6^] 
Definition) venemous, which is granted of all both 
Physitians and Philosophers. Now by Venom or 
Poyson, we commonly understand some thing that 
has in it some dangerous subtle quality that is able 
to corrupt the substance of a living body to 
the destruction or hazard of the life thereof. This 
working is apparent in this Sicknesse, by his secret 
and insensible insinuation of himself into the 
Vitall spirits, to which as soone as hee is gotten, he 
shewes himselfe a mortall enemy, offering with 
suddaine violence to extinguish them. His subtle 
entrance, his slye crueltie, his swift destroying; 
the unfaithfulnesse of his Crisis, and the other 
Prognostick signes; and the vehemencie, grievousnesse 
and ill behaviour of his Symptomes, all being 
manifest proofes of his venemous quality. For 
in this Disease the Seidge, Vrine, and sweat, have 
an abhominable savour, the breath is vile and noysome: 
Ill coloured Spots, Pustles, Blisters, swellings, 
and vlcers full of filthy matter arise in the 
outward parts of the Body: Such as no superfluitie 
or sharpnesse of Humors, nor any putrifaction 
of matter (without a venemous qualitie joyned 
with it) can possibly produce. 
 
[/16./] 
But though it may thus by the Learned be acknowledged 
to be Venemous; yet is it by many of 
the Ignorant sort conceited not to be Infectious. 
 
To satisfie such, I define Infection or Contagion 
to be That which infecteth another with his owne 
qualitie by touching it, whether the medium of the 
touch be Corporeall or Spirituall, or an Airie Breath. 
Of this kind there are divers Diseases that are infectious, 
[^p.7^] 
though not so deadly as the Plague. As 
for Example, Itch and Scabbinesse, Warts, Measels, 
small Pox, the Veneriall Pox; these by rubbing, 
and corporeall touches doe infect: Also soare 
Eyes doe by their Spirituous beames infect other 
eyes: And the Pthisick or putrified Lungs doe 
by their corrupt breath infect the lungs of others. 
But the Plague infects by all these wayes, and 
such sicke bodies infect the outward Aire, and 
that Aire again infects other Bodies. For there is 
a Seminarie Tincture full of a venemous quality, that 
being very thin and spirituous mixeth it selfe with 
the Aire, and piercing the pores of the Body, entreth 
with the same Aire, and mixeth it selfe with 
the Humors and spirits of the same Body also. 
 
For proofe of this, we see by daily experience, 
that Garments, Coffers, nay walls of Chambers 
will a long time retaine any strong sent, wherwith 
they have beene fumed. Now the Sent is meerly 
a Qualitie, and his substance is the Aire, which is also 
the Vehiculum wherein it is seated and conveighed. 
So does the Pestilent Infection take hold, 
though not sensibly (for the strongest Poysons 
have little taste or smell) yet certainly; as experience 
testifies: for Garments, and Houshold-stuffe 
have beene infected, and have infected others. As 
Fracastorius tels of a Furred-Gowne, that was the 
death of 25. Men in Verona, Anno 1511. who one 
after another wore it, thinking still they had ayred 
it sufficiently. And if Alexander Benedictus 
may be beleeved, Feather-beds will keepe the Contagion 
seaven yeares. Other experiences we have 
[^p.8^] 
also of live Poultry, which being applyed to the 
soares, are taken away dead, having not been wounded, 
crushed, nor hurt any whit at all. And many 
that have beene Infected, have plainly perceived 
where, and of whom they tooke it. 
 
[/17./] 
But (say some) then why is not one infected as 
well as another? I have eaten of the same dish, 
drunke in the same cup, and lyen in the same bed 
with such sicke ones, and that while their Soares 
were running: yet never had so much as my finger 
aking after it. 
 
[/18./] 
To this I answer, there may be Two speciall 
Causes for this. The first and Principall Cause 
is the Protection of the Almighty, which preserves 
some as miraculously as his Iustice strieks others. 
Thus through his Mercy he often preserves those 
that with faithfull and conscionable care doe 
Christian offices about the Sicke; being warrantably 
called thereto, and not thrusting themselves 
eyther presumptuously, or rashly into the 
businesse without a just, and reason-rendring 
Cause. For GOD has given his Angels charge 
over vs, to keepe vs in all our wayes, as the Psalmist 
sings. 
 
And secondly, every pestilent Contagion is not of 
the same nature, nor hath equall conformity with 
every Constitution, Age, or manner of Living: 
For some Contagion is apt to infect onely the Sanguin 
complexion, some the Cholericke, some the 
Phlegmaticke onely: Some Children, some 
Youths, some those of Ripe age, some Antient people; 
some the Rich, and other the poore onely: 
[^p.9^] 
And where the Seminarie Tincture hath no Analogie, 
there is none, or verie flight Infection. 
 
[/19./] 
And first those are most apt to be Infected, that 
have thin Bodyes and open pores; and whose hearts 
are so hot, that they need much attraction of Aire 
to coole them. 
 
Also, they whose Veynes and Vessels, are full of 
grosse humors, and corrupt juyces (the venemous 
matter being thicke, and therefore unapt to breath 
through the pores) their putrefaction is increased 
by the inward heat, and so driven to malignitie; 
and thence onward to a Pestilent qualitie. Hence 
those bodies that are moist and full of Phlegmaticke 
humors, whose veines are straight (and therefore 
apter to intercept then entertaine those well 
well concocted juyces that would make the purest 
Bloud) and the thicknesse of whose skin denies 
the transpiration of excrements: these are easily 
poluted and infected. 
 
And such are Women, especially women with 
childe; for their bodies are full of excrementitious 
humors, and much heat withall, which is as 
oile and flame put together. Also Virgins that are 
ripe for marriage, are apt to receive infection, and 
being once stricken, seldome or never escape without 
great meanes. Quia spirituosum semen in motu 
cum sit facile succenditur; vel quia intus detentum 
facile corrumpitur, & in veneni perniciem abit. Minderexus 
de Pestilen. c. 10. 
 
Also young Children, in regard of their soft, tender, 
and moist bodies; and likewise because they 
feed on moister meats, and feed with more appetite 
then judgment. 
 
[^p.10^] 
Likewise, the more Pure and delicace Complexions, 
whose bloud is finer and thinner then others, 
is so much the more apt to receive mutation: and 
the Contagion insinuates it selfe into all the humors; 
But first and most easily into Bloud; Choler 
next, more slowly into Phlegme, and most rarely 
into Melancholy. 
 
Those that are fearefull likewise, as I shall 
prove anon, when I treat of Passions of the 
Minde. 
 
Those that are very Costive, or have their water-stop'd; 
the noysome vapours that are by these 
excrements engendred, make the body apt to infection. 
And such as in former times have had 
customary evacuations by sweat, Hæmerrhoids, 
Vomitings, Menstrua, Fontanels, or other like vents 
for noxious humours; and have them now stopped. 
 
Those that Fast too long (their bodyes being 
emptie) receive more ayre in then they let out: 
and (their spirits being weakned for want of due 
nourishment) they have lesse strength to resist 
the contagion. 
 
On the other side Gluttons and Drunkards (let 
them argue what they will for the filling of the 
veynes, as they use to say, to keepe out the evill 
ayre) can never be free from crudities and distemper'd 
bloud; which easily takes infection: 
As Hippocrates testifies, when he sayes: Corpora 
impura quo magis aluntur; eo magis laduntur. Impure 
bodyes the more they are nourished the more 
they are endangered. 
 
[^p.11^] 
Poore people (by reason of their great want) living 
sluttishly, and feeding nastily and unwholsomly, 
on any food they can with least cost purchase, 
have corrupted bodyes, and of all others 
are therefore more subject to this Sicknesse. 
 
And yet the Rich are also as subject in too much 
pampering dyet, bringing themselves thereby to 
an Athleticke habit, which Hippocrates in the third 
Aphorisme of his first booke, proves to be very dangerous 
at all times. 
 
Furthermore, nearenesse of Bloud or Kinred, by 
Sympathy of nature, is another aptnesse. 
 
And lastly, those that are continually conversant 
with the sicke, are in greatest danger, though 
many escape through Gods mercifull protection. 
 
[/20./] 
But Old folkes, whose bodyes are cold and dry, 
Confident Spirits, whose very courage is an Antidote, 
if they keepe their bodyes cleane by a regular 
course of life. And those that have the Gout, in 
whom the nobler parts of the body doe expell 
the noxious humors to the ignobler. 
 
Milch-Nurses because their Children sucke the 
evill juyces from them with their milke. These 
are in the way likely to escape: but if the Nurse 
be infected, the childe cannot recover it. 
 
Also those that have Fontanels, or any other 
kinde of Issue; as Vlcers, Hæmerrhoids, or plenty 
of other evacuations, whereby the hurtfull humors 
are dreyned away. 
 
And lastly, those that keepe themselves private; 
using good Antidotes and meanes præservative: 
such are least subject to Infection. Diogenes Laertius 
[^p.12^] 
lib. 2. sayes, that Socrates (by temperate and 
discreet diet) lived in Athens divers Plague-times, 
yet was never touched with it. 
 
[/21./] 
Now what this Dyet Preservative is, I will 
briefly shew you. 
Dyet consists of Sixe Points: 
 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
viz. 
	Ayre. 
	Meate and Drinke. 
	Repletion and Evacuation. 
	Exercise and Rest. 
	Sleepe and Watching. 
	Passions of the Minde. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
They are composed also in these two Verses. 
Aer, Esca, Quies, Repletio, Gaudia, Somnus: 
Hæc moderata juvant, immoderata nocent. 
 
These indeed are the sixe Strings of Apollo's Viall, 
wherein consisteth the whole harmonie of 
health. If these be in tune, the body is sound: But 
any of these too high wrested, or too much slackned 
(that is immoderately used) makes a discord 
in nature, and puts the whole body out of tune. 
 
[}For Ayre first.}] 
 
[/22./] 
Ayre is that which we draw in with our breath 
continually, and wee cannot live without it one 
minute; for it is the food of our Spirits, and 
therefore we had need take heed that the ayre we 
draw be pure and wholsome. The whole streame 
of Opinion runnes upon a cold and dry Aire, so 
commending the North and East windes, as most 
[^p.13^] 
wholsome: and condemning the Hot and Moist 
[/23./] 
aire engendred by the South and West windes, as 
the fittest matter for infection, because most apt 
to putrefaction. So Hippocrates (in the 2=d=. of his 
Epidem.) saith, that in Cranon a Citie of Thessalie, 
there arose putrid Vlcers, Pustuls, and Carbuncles, 
through the hot and moyst constitution of the ayre. 
And Galen (in 1. de Temperam. c. 4.) affirmeth, 
that the hot and moyst constitution of the ayre, doth 
most of all breed pestilent diseases. And from these 
mouthes, a multitude of late Writers have learnt 
to speake the same thing. Yet we know that the 
hot and dry weather also, may cause a contagious 
ayre. So saith Avenzoar in his 3. Booke, 3. Tract. 
and 1. chap. And Titus Livius (in lib. 1. decad. 4.) 
recordeth, that Rome was infected with the Plague 
by a Hot and Dry distemper of the Aire. Wee also 
may remember, that the Summer 1624. was an 
extreame dry and parching Summer: and we cannot 
forget that this last Summer was not much unlike 
it. The Contagion indeed this yeare was begotten 
beyond Sea, and was rock'd hither in 
sicke bodyes; but our Ayre I feare will prove a 
Nurse though not a Mother to it: This Spring answering 
to the fore-past Summer in heate and 
drouth. 
 
[/24./] 
Now to avoyde the mischiefes of unwholsome 
ayre; Hippocrates the Prince of Physitians, 
(in his Booke de Natura humana) gives this counsell. 
Providendum est ut quam paucissimus aeris influxus 
corpus ingrediatur, & ut ille ipse quam peregrinus 
existat: Regionum etiam locos in quibus morbus consistat, 
[^p.14^] 
quantum ejus fieri potest permutare oportet. 
 
Others advise in threee words. Cito, Longe, 
Tarde, which Iordanus calls an Antidote made of 3. 
adverbs, thus versifying upon them. 
Hæc trisa tabificam pellunt adverbia Pestem; 
Mox, Longe, Tarde; Cede, recede, redi. 
 
But I will not teach to flee; for too many with 
Dedalus put on wings the last great visitation, 
that with Icarus dropt downe by the way. Onely 
[/25./] 
my counsell is this. Let every one keepe himselfe 
as priuate as he may: Shun throngs of people, and 
all wet, close, and stinking places. Walke not abroad 
before, nor after Sunne. Keep moderation 
between heat and cold in all things; yet rather 
encline to heate a little, because of drying up superfluous 
moystures. Let the streets bee kept 
cleane; washing the channels every morning and 
evening, and sweeping away all durt, leaves, 
stalkes, and rootes of hearbes, and offals; leaving 
no dunghils nor other noysome matter in the 
[/26./] 
streets. Also in the evenings it is good to purifie 
the ayre with Bonefires, but especially with Fire-workes: 
or rather with discharging of peeces: for 
Gunpowder is exceeding drying by reason of the 
Salt-peeter and Sulphur with which it is made, and 
by the crackes that it gives, the Ayre is forcibly 
shaken and attenuated, and so opened to let in that 
purification, which is immediately made by the 
fire that goes along with it. This way is commended 
by Levinus Lemnius, de Ocultis Naturæ Mirac. 
lib. 2. cap. 10. Also by Crato in consilio 275. By Raymundus 
[^p.15^] 
Mindererus lib. de Pestilentia cap. 20. and 
all the late Writers. 
 
[/27./] 
Within doores observe, that little houses must 
not be pestered with many Lodgers, for it is best 
(for those that are able) to have shift of Beds and 
Chambers to lie in, that the ayre in them may be 
kept free and sweet. Keepe every roome daily 
very cleane, leaving no sluts corners. Let not 
Water stand so long in any vessell as to putrifie; 
which in hot weather it will soone doe. Make 
Fires every day in everie roome, in quantitie according 
to the largenesse of the roome, and the 
temperature of the weather. Perfume them and 
all the houshold-stuffe in cold and moist weather 
with Frankinsense, Storax, Benjamin, Pitch, Rosin, 
Lignum aloes, Lignum Rhodium, Iuniper-wood, or 
the Berries. In hot and drie weather with Rosewater 
on a hot Fire-shovell, or some such like 
coole fume in a perfuming-pot. Strew the Windowes 
and ledges with Rew, Wormwood, Lavender, 
Marjoram, Penyriall, Costmary, and such like in cold 
weather; but in hot with Primroses, Violets, Rose-leaves, 
Borrage, and such cooling scents. 
 
[/28./] 
For Garments, avoide (as much as may bee) all 
leather, woollen, and furres: also velvets, plush, 
and shagge. Choose such as may be watered, as 
chamlets, grograms, paropas, philip and chenyes, and 
such like: for their gumminesse excludeth the infectious 
aire best. Have shift, and shift often; and 
still as cloathes are left off, perfume them well. 
 
Beware of buying old clothes, Bedding or 
such like stuffe: for if they have beene used by 
[^p.16^] 
the infected, they are verie dangerous, as I told 
you before in the authoritie of a furr'd Gowne, and 
Feather-beds. 
 
[/29./] 
Carrie in your mouth a peece of Citron-pill, or 
for want of that, of Lemon-pill; a Clove, or a 
peece of Tormentill Root. Or if any will resort to 
me in Golding-lane, I will soone provide for 
them Lozenges to hold in their mouth, fit for their 
constitution, and such as I have had good experience 
of, the last great Plague time. 
 
[/30./] 
Carry in your hand a Lemon stucke with cloves, 
sweet Marjoram, Lavender, Balme, Rew, or Wormwood; 
as the constitution of your braine shall require. 
For beleeve by my experience, that many 
did enflame their braines, and so fell into the 
Sicknesse they shunned in the last great Contagion, 
by smelling to, and carrying things in their 
[/31./] 
mouthes too hot for their complexion. Camphor 
also, though it be accounted an excellent coole 
fume for ill aires, yet those that have cold and 
weake stomacks are very much weakned by the 
use of it. 
 
But beware of unsavourie smels and stinking odours: 
For though Dioscorides commends Galbanum, 
and Cardan the burning of Leather, Averroes 
a potion of Vrine, and others the smelling to 
Horse-dung: yet I stand to it, that sweet and pleasing 
odours are more proper; because they dilate, 
restore and comfort the Spirits; whereas 
the contrary doe contract, and repugne them; 
and so weaken the faculties. I intend to have also 
preservative waters to dip Spunges in for severall 
[^p.17^] 
Constitutions, to be carried in Boxes to smell to: 
As also, preservative Pomanders of choyse vertue. 
 
[/32./] 
The next point of Dyet, is Meat and Drinke. 
Let your meate be alwayes good and sweet, temperate 
betwixt hot and cold, and not too moyst 
or flashie: easie of digestion, and such as makes 
the best Bloud. 
 
[/33./] 
Such are Beefe, Mutton, Lambe, Kid, and Cony. 
Turkey, Capon, Pullet, Partridge, Pheasant, 
Pigeons, Turtles, Larkes, Black birds, Thrushes, and 
Finches. All Water-fowles are naught. The Hearts 
of Red and Fallow Deere, are speciall good: 
so also are those of young Steeres, Calves, Kids, 
and Lambes: beeing cordiall, both by reason of 
Sympathy, and solidnesse of the flesh, which causeth 
them to be the lesse corruptible. 
 
[/34./] 
Of Fish, (which should be eaten but seldome, 
though it be of the best kinde) the elected are fresh 
Salmon, Trout, Barbell, Shrimps, Playse and Flounders, 
(when they are firme, not flashy) Smelts, Makarell, 
Gudgion, Mullet, Soale, Gurnard, Lobster, 
and Cray-fish. But Eeles, Lamperns, and Lampreys, 
with all such as delight in Mud, are to bee avoyded. 
 
[/35./] 
Egges of Hennes and Turkeys, are good. 
 
[/36./] 
Oyle and Butter, are kindes of Antidotes against 
venome; and Butter-milke may now and 
then be used by hot Constitutions. 
 
[/37./] 
Fruites must be eaten but sparingly. 
 
Those that wee may be most bold withall, are 
[^p.18^] 
sowre Cherries; Plums, and Gooseberries before 
they be full ripe, having a sowre taste. Also Peaches, 
Quinces, Pomgranads, Oranges, Limons, Medlars, 
Services, Mulberries, Raspes, Strawberries, and 
Currans, which being not full ripe are astringent, 
but ripe doe loosen the body. But of Walnuts, Filbers, 
and Small-nuts, the elder are the better. Dryed 
Fruits also are good, whether they bee Peares, 
Plums, Cherries, Figs, Raisons, or Prunes. Moreover, 
Pease, Beanes, and Artichokes, may be used sometimes 
by leane and spare Bodies. If other Fruits 
that are colder and moyster bee longed for; eate 
after them an Orange with a little fennell and salt. 
 
[/38./] 
The best Rootes are Onions, Leekes, and Radishes, 
for these are vertuous against venome. But they 
offend hot heads, and weake eyes. 
 
[/39./] 
Of Herbes; Rue, Wormwood, Balme, Mints, Pennyryall, 
Rosemary, Sage, sweet Marjorum, and Time. For 
Sallets and Sauces, Burrage, Buglosse, Violets, Fennell, 
and especially Sorrell; Olives also, and Capers. 
 
[/40./] 
Vineger, Verjuice, juice of Limons and Oranges; 
which for their drynesse resist putrifaction, and 
for their coolnesse, Feavors. But those colder 
stomackes that are offended with them, may temper 
them with Wine and Spices. Yet there must 
be cautious usage of hot spices, and all salt meates, 
lest they inflame the Bloud; though in regard of 
their drying and heating quality they be usefull 
in some bodies, and at some times; especially for 
cold and waterish stomackes: Others must mixe 
them with Vineger, Verjuice, or the juice of Limons 
or Oranges. 
 
[^p.19^] 
[/41./] 
Note here, That Vineger is of a speciall vertue 
against putrifaction, as AMBROSE PAREY in the 
8. Chapter of his Booke of the Plague proveth, by 
the use of it in washing dead bodies with it before 
they are Embalmed, that they may keepe 
[/42./] 
sweet the longer. But it is not so good for Women, 
because it offends the Mother (as CRATO affirmeth, 
Consil. 275.) therefore they must allay it 
with white Wine and Sugar. 
 
[/43./] 
Note also, that Cabbages, Coleworts, Lettuce, 
Pompions, Musk-Mellons, and Coucumbers, are very 
dangerous meates in contagious times; neither 
doe I approve of any other rootes, then Garlicke, 
for rusticke bodies; and for others Onions, 
Leekes, and Radishes (as I said before) onely. 
 
[/44./] 
Roasting is the best way of dressing Flesh, and 
Frying or Broyling of Fish. 
 
[/45./] 
Broths are but for Sicke and weake ones fit: And 
then they must be sharpned with a little Vineger, 
or juice of Lemmons. For (as MANARDUS sayes, 
lib. 5. Epist. 3.) the body ought rather to be dried 
then moystened. 
 
[/46./] 
And so then for Drinke, it must be as little as 
may well be borne; good and pure, whether it be 
Beere, Ale, or Wine, (for Mede, Vsqubaq~, Bragget, 
&c. I account them rather Medicines then parts 
of Food) But neither heady, too sweet, nor too 
small. To a weake stomacke and a feeble Nature, 
[/47./] 
Wine is an Antidote against all Poysons; as CELSUS 
lib. 8. de Re Medica cap. 27. affirmeth. And 
Senectutis summa est medicina, as AETIUS teaches, 
Tetr- 1. serm. 4. cap. 30. But let not those that 
[^p.20^] 
are young and strong, make a common use of 
them in Contagious times: For it must needs 
breed Inflamation, after which followes Putrifaction, 
which is a fit host to entertaine such an 
ill guest as the Pestilence. 
 
[/48./] 
Wheaten-Bread of a Day old, and a little leavened 
is absolutely the best for healthy people. 
Light Biskets also with Anise-seeds is very good. 
 
[/49./] 
For the strict Quantitie of Eating and Drinking, 
I cannot stint every mans stomacke; but 
must conclude with HIPPOCRATES, Aph. 17. lib. 
1. Concedendum est aliquid Tempori, Regioni, Ætati, 
& Consuetudini. The Season, Place and Custome, 
must beare some sway in these things. Only 
beware of Sacietie or Glutting: For the same 
Hippocrates in his 17th. Aphorisme, in the 2. Booke. 
Sayes, that Meate and Drinke immoderately taken, 
causeth Sicknesse. For from thence arise Crudities, 
which (sayth GALEN, in Comm. 2. in Hippocr. de 
Natur. Humana.) breed new Diseases. Therefore 
hearken to AVICEN, Who adviseth alwayes to rise 
from Meate with some remainder of appetite: for 
within halfe an houre, or thereabouts, as soone as the 
meate first eaten beginneth to digest, our hunger ceaseth, 
lib. 1. Fen 3. Doct. 2. cap 7. And hence it is, 
that some (greedily following the sense of their 
appetite onely) over-charge their stomackes even 
to vomiting, before they feele themselves satisfied: 
because though the vessell be over-full, 
yet appetite is not appeased till Concoction have 
begun her worke upon some part of that which is 
already received. 
 
[^p.21^] 
[/50./] 
And here I cannot but justly taxe those that 
give up themselves to disorderly Dyet. For the 
lives of many are so monstrous, that HELIOGABALVS 
was but a pingler to them. 
 
The Dutch may yeeld up theyr seas of Drinking, 
and strike sayle to the English. Men loose 
theyr good names, and are faine to get new ones, 
as to bee called Blades and Roarers, as if they had 
beene begotten by drunken Cutlers, or bruitish 
Bulls. There was one DIOTEMVS of Athens, 
that was called the Tunnell, for his filthy delight 
in Drinke, and drinking in a Tunnell. What doe 
many in this Land (too too many in this Citie) but 
rise to Drinke, drinke to fall, fall a sleepe of necessity; 
and ere they are halfe sober, fall a drinking 
drunke againe. That as VALERIVS AVRELIANVS 
the Emperor was wont to say of BONOSVS, 
a Spaniard, Such are borne, not to live, but to drinke. 
 
[/51./] 
If any of that Luxurious sect beate this time 
sober, let them but listen to the testimonies of 
learned Experience, and they will tell them into 
what bodily dangers they plunge themselves by 
this detestable disorder. 
 
[/52./] 
HIPPOCRATES has an Aphorisme to this purpose, 
that Meate and Drinke immoderately taken 
causeth Sicknesse. 
 
[/53./] 
PAVLVS ÆGINETA goes yet further, saying; 
That the Veynes being filled too full, are afflicted, distended, 
or else broken: obstructed, filled with winde 
and over-charged. And of all diseases, hee affirmeth, 
That over-charging of the vessels is the 
worst. 
 
[^p.22^] 
[/54./] 
GALEN affirmes, that Drunkennesse, and Crudities 
(which arise from intemperance) doe breed 
new diseases. 
 
[/55./] 
And in another place, he sayes, Whereas Wine 
moderately taken increaseth Naturall heate; as being 
his proper aliment: by Drunkennesse commeth 
Astonishment of the Braine, Falling sicknesse, or some 
maime either to sence or motion. And so, the best 
meates which afford most nourishment, being immoderately 
eaten, ingender cold Diseases. 
 
[/56./] 
But AVICEN more particularly layes downe 
the dangers that follow this over-repletion, in 
these words. Eating mush nourisheth not, but fills the 
Body with Crudities, and raw humors, stops the pores, 
weakens the powers of Nature; causes putrifaction, 
mixed feavors, short breath, Sciatica and joynt Aches. 
 
[/57./] 
Againe, in another place hee speakes Drinking, 
thus: Much drinking of Wine in Sanguine and Cholerick 
Complexions, over-heats the bloud, and causeth 
Choller to superabound; and by too much repletion of 
the veynes and Vessels, there may follow a hot Apoplexie, 
and suddaine death. In Cold Complexions, it 
breeds diseases of the Sinewes; and that for two causes. 
The first is the over-moystning of the Nerves; the 
other the turning of the drinke into Vineger before it 
it can passe through the Body. So the Nerves are by 
the former relaxed, and by the latter corroded, whereupon 
followes the cold Apoplexie, Astonishment, 
Senslesnesse, Lethargie, Palsey, Trembling of the 
Limbes, and convulsions of the Mouth. 
 
And what these have said of Wine, the same is 
true likewise of all oiher strong Drinkes. I hope 
[^p.23^] 
these lines will keepe such men the soberer in this 
dangerous time; and in that sober tune, the time 
may touch their hart strings so, that Sobrietie may 
let in Religious meditations (which continuall 
Drunkenesse has lock'd out of doores.) And then 
Repentance may draw them to GOD, and him 
neerer to them; and so they may become new 
Creatures. Which the Father for his Sonnes sake 
grant. 
 
[/58./] 
In the meane time, let those that are in health 
eate Flesh; but the Sicke the Iuices of them rather, 
because aliment must be made more easie and 
quicke for their supply. And for such weake 
ones, Veale, Chicken, Caponet, Partridge, and Pheasant, 
are to be boyled till all the vertue of the meat 
be boyled out, and then the Broth to be strained 
hard, that the flesh may be left juicelesse, so will 
all the strength of the meate be in the broth; 
which you may spice with some of these powders 
following: 
 
Take of Red Saunders halfe an ounce, Cynnamon 
iij. drams and halfe, Saffron halfe a dram. 
Make them into fine Powder. 
Or else 
Take of Cynamon halfe an ounce, Cloves and 
Saffron, of each halfe a dram, Red Corall ij. 
Scruples. And the weight of all in Sugar. 
Make of them a fine Powder. 
 
But Women (dum Menses effluunt) must not 
use Saffron so much. For such therefore this Powder 
is better. 
 
[^p.24^] 
Take Harts-horne, red and yellow Saunders, of 
each ij. drams, Cloves and Cynamon, of each 
one dram. 
Make a fine Powder. 
 
Let all be more sparing in Dyet now, then at 
other times: Eate little, and Drinke lesse. But 
never goe out of doores Fasting. 
 
[/59./] 
Take therefore first of some Antidote, of 
which kind the Apothecaries shops are (or ought 
to bee) alwayes stored with these: 
 
That is, 
Theriaca Andromachi, Venice Triacle. 
Theriaca Londinensis, London Triacle. 
Mithridatium Damocratis, Mitridate: 
Electuarium de Ovo Imperatoris, 
Antidotus magna Mathioli, 
Confectio Liberans, 
Dioscordium. Of any of these, take the quantity 
of a Nutmeg. 
Confectio Alkernes, 
Confectio de Hiacyntho. 
Of eyther of these, take the quantitie of an Hazell-nut. 
 
If you would choose to take Powder rather; 
Pulvis Contra Pestem Montagnanæ. halfe a 
Dram. 
 
Of Waters, there is - 
Aqua Angelicæ, 
Aqua Theriacalis. Of eyther of these halfe 
an Ounce, either with white Wine and a few drops 
of the juice of a Limon; 
[^p.25^] 
Or, Aqua Bezoartica Langii. Aqua Cælestis Mathioli, 
for the richer sort, with a drop fo Oyle of 
Vitriol, in halfe an ounce of eyther. 
 
But for such as abhorre the taste of Physicke, 
and had rather take their Antidote in forme of 
Pills then otherwise; let a skilfull Apothecarie 
make this masse of Pills.

Of which ten, fifteene, twenty, or two shillings 
graines may be taken at once in one, or two, or 
three Pills, as the party can swallow them in bignesse. 
 
Those that are offended with the heate of Triacle, 
or other of the hot Antidotes above named: 
may use this Opiate made by an Apothecarie; 
which is excellent for hot complexions.

[/60./] 
Neither must women with childe be over-heated 
with common Antidotes. Therefore theirs 
must be onely of Terra Lemnia, Bole Armoniack, 
Harts-horne; Conserves and Syrups of Roses, Violets, 
and Betony. Or a little Mithridate, with twice as 
much conserve of Borrage or Buglosse. Likewise, 
the species de gemmis frig. or of Diamargarfrig. 
in Borrage, Buglosse, and Carduus water. 
Or else such may have this Antidote made for the~.

[/61./] 
For young Children, there is nothing better or 
fitter then Bole Armoniack, or Terra Lemnia, with 
a little Tormentill roote, or Citron pills, made into 
fine Powder, and mixed with their meates, butter, 
and broths; for their breakfasts. And because 
they are not much to be tampered with by 
internall medicines, annoint the region of their 
heart with oyle of Hypericon, every morning and 
evening: or with oleo Scorpionium, or oleo corcino: 
or else let them commonly weare next their skin 
over their heart, such a Quilt as this. 
 
Take of red Roses 2. drams, red saunders, red corrall, 
& spodium, of each one dram, Zedoarie 
[^p.27^] 
lignum aloes, cynnamon, cloves, citron-pill, 
saffron, of each halfe a dram. 
Sew it up in a peece of red Sarcenet or Calico, moysten 
it with a little Rose-vineger, so heat it 
and apply it warme. And when it waxeth dry 
moyst it, and heate it so againe 
 
[/27./] 
And take this note by the way. 
 
When you suspect a Childe to have the wormes 
in a contagious time, use not Wormseed, nor those 
common trifles; but order him as in danger of 
Infection: for that disease comming of so much 
putrefaction as it does, is apt to receive contagion, 
as tinder to take fire. Give it (therefore) ten 
or twenty graines of this Powder following. 
 
Take of Harts-horne one dram, citron pill, rootes 
of Angelica, and Tormentill, Rheubarb, and 
Coralline, of each halfe a dram. 
 
Make all into a fine powder; and give the aforesaid 
quantity in a little Carduus water, sweetned 
with some sugar. 
[/63./] 
 
After the taking of any of these Antidotes, abstaine 
from all meat and drinke for two or three 
houres. And then eate a piece of Bread and 
butter strewed with a little grated Nutmeg. Or 
Bread and Sallet-oyle, spiced with the powder of 
Tormentill rootes. Or a piece of Bread sopped in 
White-wine, allayed with a little Vineger. 
 
[/64./] 
Let your Dinner be about high noone, and then 
eat not of above two of three several dishes. Your 
Supper at five or sixe a clocke in the evening, and 
then let one dish suffice. For it is a pretty saying, 
[^p.28^] 
and worth the noting. In the Morning a little is enough, 
at Noone enough is but a little, but at Night, a 
little may be too much. 
 
[/65./] 
Goe not to bed till three or foure houes after 
Supper, lest sleeping upon a full stomacke, you 
hinder digestion. And so I bid good night to 
the second Point of Dyet. 
 
[/66./] 
The third Point, is Repletion, and Evacuation. 
When you arise in the morning rub your sides, 
armes, thighes, and legs downward gently, your 
clothes being on, combe your head and rub it. 
Hake, spit, and blow your nose, to evacuate the 
excrements of your head and stomacke. Then assay 
to make water, and to goe to stoole, and labor 
to bring your body to this dayly custome. For 
The body ought especially to bee kept free from superfluities: 
saith Galen. lib. 1. de Differ. Feb. cap. 4. 
Therefore if you be costive, use some supposistory 
or Clyster; and suffer not two whole dayes to 
passe without such evacuation. 
 
[/67./] 
It is necessary that every one that hath so much 
understanding, doe learne to know whether he be 
Phlethorick or Cacochymick; If Phlethorick (that is 
full of bloud, as those that live in high feeding) 
it will appeare by his high colour, full veynes, 
pulse greater and more frequent then it used ordinarily 
to be, pursinesse, heavinesse and dulnesse of 
body, and such like signes. If you bee costive, 
take a common Clyster first; then be let bloud, according 
to the appointment of some skilfull Physitian, 
and so ordered afterwards according to 
Art. 
 
[^p.29^] 
[/68./] 
If Cacochymick, that is, full of grosse and corrupted 
humors, which will appeare by the palenesse 
and ill colour of the face, defective strength, 
and the like. He must be well purged, which none 
but a Physitian can safely prescribe, and that upon 
examination of his Body and Vrine. 
 
[/69./] 
But as a generall rule, all doe appoint some 
purging medicine twice or thrice in a weeke, to 
keepe the Body free from the increase of superfluous 
humors. To this purpose the Pills of RUFFUS 
(which are common in every Shop) are very apt 
and good. Or, if you please use these of mine, 
whereof I had happy experience in the last great 
Visitation. 
 
[/70./] 
Rs. Aloes Rosatæ, unc. 1.

Make Pils of 8. 10. or 12. graines a piece; and 
take 2 or 3. at a time; either at bed time, or after the 
first sleep: you may take them in Syrup of Roses, or 
conserve of Violets: or if you will, in the yolke of a 
reare egge. And it is good to drink after them 
when you rise in the morning, in cold weather a 
little draught of white Wine mixed with Balme-water. 
In hot weather, white-Wine and Succorie-water, 
with a drop or two of oyle of Vitrioll in it. 
 
But those that cannot take Pills, may have 
this Syrup made for them. which for his excellent 
[^p.30^] 
vertue in this case, is called Syrupus Divinus, 
the Diuine Syrup.

Take two or three spoonefuls of this, more or 
lesse as it workes: But keepe very warme, for 
it causeth sweat as wel as seidge. In a Manuscript 
of my Grandfather BANISTERS, I finde this called 
St. AMBROSE his Syrup. The same a little altered 
is in RENODÆVS his Disponsatorie; and hee 
hath added two drams of Diagredium. Let men 
of judgment doe as they please; I like it best as I 
have set it downe. RENODÆUS gives it this Title 
(not acknowledging any Author) Syrupus qui reddit 
corpus mundum a superfluitatibus; & per consequens, 
cor, cerebrum, hepar et omnia alia membra 
confortat. Which commendations agrees with 
my Title: for it is worthy of all commendations. 
 
[/72./] 
That Morning that you take your Purging Medicine, 
you must forbeare your other Antidote. 
 
Women with childe, must be kept solluble onely 
[^p.31^] 
with mild Suppositories, and gentle Glysters, wherein 
a little new drawne Cassia is to be used. Or else 
a milde Potion made with some Pectorall Decoction, 
and a little Cassia: for stronger purgatives, will 
endanger abortion. But these ought to be directed 
by a good Physitian. 
 
[/73./] 
Young children also with a Violet comfit, (for a 
Suppository) dipped in sweet sallet oyle: or else a 
little Cassia newly drawne, dissolved in a small 
draught of Chicken-broth; or a litttle Manna in 
the like broth, or in posset-drinke. 
 
[/74./] 
Beware of Bathings, especially in open standing 
waters, within the Region of the Aire infected. 
 
[/75./] 
If Vrine or Menstrua stop, repaire speedily to 
the Physitian for counsaile. 
 
[/76./] 
Fly Venus as farre as you may, for in these times 
she has but an ill name. 
 
[/77./] 
Sweat comming easily of it selfe; and within 
dores (the house being well aired) is good, so it 
exceed not. But abroad it is dangerous. 
 
[/78./] 
Lastly, it is good to keepe open all Issues, and 
running sores; because Nature will labour to expell 
any venom to such a Common-sewer. 
 
[}The fourth Point, is Exercise and Rest.}] 
 
Lazinesse encreaseth superfluous humours, and 
over-violent labour, wasteth away the nourishing 
[/79./] 
ones. But moderate exercise (ad ruborem non ad sudorem) 
stirreth up and nourisheth Naturall heate, 
helping Concoction and Evacuation; if also it be used 
in seasonable times and convenient places. 
[/80./] 
The best Exercise is walking with a little stirring 
[^p.32^] 
[/81./] 
of the armes. The Time, in the morning: and 
the place, eyther in a pure ayre abroad, or in a 
purified ayre at home, in some large roome, where 
is little or no company, by the heate of their bodies 
and breaths, to distemper the Aire. But at 
all times beware of taking cold; for great colds 
and rheumes doe easily putrid Feavors, and they 
as easily prove Pestilent. 
 
[}Sleepe and Watching is the fifth point.}] 
 
Sleepe eyther immoderate or unseasonable, hindereth 
digestion, and causes crudities, quels the 
vitall and dulls the Animall Spirits. Watching also 
over-much, dries up and inflames the good Bloud, 
and weakens all the powers of Nature. 
 
Let your sleepe therefore be seasonable, and not 
superfluous. Not upon your dinner, unlesse custome 
commands it; and then take it but vaping 
for halfe an houre or so, sitting in a Chaire 
upright. 
 
Three houres at least after a light Supper goe 
to Bed; where let five or sixe houres suffice for 
sleepe. Lye conveniently warme, the Chamber 
dores and windowes being shut to exclude the 
night ayre. But beware of sleeping or lying on 
the ground or grasse: for the nearer the earth the 
more deadly is the Aire. And the immediate 
stroake of the cold vapors rising from the ground 
is dangerous at all times. 
 
[}The Sixt Point of Diet, is Passions of the Mind.}] 
 
[/82./] 
All kindes of Passion, if they be vehement, doe 
[^p.33^] 
offer violence to the Spirits; yea though they be 
of the better and more naturall sort. 
[/83./] 
 
As Laughter (if unbridled) doth runne even 
life out of breath, and greatly perplexeth the Body: 
in so much as the brest and sides are pained, 
the breath is straitned, and sometimes the Soule 
it selfe, is (as I may say) laughed out of her skin. 
 
[/84./] 
For so it is recorded of CHRYSIPPVS, That 
onely upon the sight of an Asse eating Figges, he 
brake into such an unmeasurable laughter, that he 
fell downe and dyed. 
 
And XENXIS that excellent Painter (who made 
a most curious beautifull Picture of the Spartan 
HELEN) upon the sight of a very ill favoured old 
woman, burst out into such a profuse laughter, 
that he laugh'd himselfe to death. 
 
[/85./] 
Now this is a disease of the Spleene, called Risus 
Sardonius, with which I have knowne some of 
my acquaintance not long agoe grieved. 
 
[/86./] 
But sometimes immoderate Ioy, lives not to the 
age of Laughter, when it bindes the vitall Spirits 
so close together that it choakes the heart instantly: 
[/87./] 
For so SOPHOCLES the Tragedian, receiving 
a wonderfull applause of the people for the last 
Tragedy he wrote; was so over-joyed at it, that 
he became a Tragedy himselfe and dyed upon it. 
 
The like is recorded of one RHODIAS DIAGORAS, 
who when he saw his three Sonnes all at 
one time crowned with victory at the Olympian 
games, ranne to meet them: And while hee embraced 
them in his armes, and they planted theyr 
Garlands on his head, hee was so overcome with 
[^p.34^] 
joy, that he turned theyr Ensignes of victory into 
the penons of his Funerall. 
 
[/88./] 
Sorrow on the other side afflicts the Heart, disturbes 
the Faculties, melts the Braine, vitiates the 
humours, and so weakens all the principall parts; 
yea, sometimes sinkes the Body into the grave. 
 
[/89./] 
As ADRASTVS King of the Argives, beeing 
told of the death of his Sonne, was taken with so 
violent a Sorrow, that he fell downe and dyed immediatly. 
 
And so IULIA the Daughter of Iulius Cæsar, 
and wife to POMPEY, when shee heard the tydings 
of her Husbands death, made that houre the 
last witnesse that she had liv'd only to heare it. 
 
[/90./] 
Anger is also so furious a Passion, that it violently 
disturbes the Spirits and Faculties; as appeares 
by the shaking and tossing of the Body too 
and fro; the fierie sparkling of the Eyes, the colour 
comming and going, now red, now pale; so 
that all the humours appeare to be enflamed (especially 
Choller,) and the Spirits hurried this way 
and that way: sometimes thrust outward, and 
presently halled in againe. By which violent motions 
an unnaturall heat in the Spirits, and corruption 
in the humours are ingendered. Hereupon 
many times follow Burning Feavors, Palsies, violent 
Bleedings, losse of Speech, and sometimes Death 
it selfe. 
 
[/91./] 
NERVA the Emperour being highly displeased 
with one REGVLVS, fell into such a fury against 
him that he was stricken therewith into a Feavor, 
whereof he dyed within a few dayes after. 
 
[^p.35^] 
WENCESLAVS King of Bohemia, in a rage conceived 
against his Cup-bearer, would needs kill 
him presently with his owne hand; but his endeavour 
was his owne deaths man, striking him with 
a Palsey, that shooke him shortly after into ashes. 
 
VALENTINIANVS the Emperour, in a fierce 
fury would needs destroy the whole Country of 
Sarmatia but his unruly rage brake a veyne within 
him, and his owne life-bloud ended his bloudy designe. 
 
In the yeare of our Lord 1523. A poore old 
man in the North part of Devonshire (dwelling in 
a part of a little Village called Little Podderidge) 
came to a Worthy Knights house (Sir THOMAS 
MONKE by name) dwelling in the same Parish, 
(which was called St. Merton) in whose house I 
at that time was. And the old man standing at 
the Buttery hatch to receive some Beere: because 
the Buttery mayd did not presently fill his Tankerd 
at his call, he fell into such a fury against her, 
that with the very passion, hee presently fell 
downe, was taken up for dead; was with much 
a doe by me recovered to life and sence, but 
never spake againe, and dyed within two dayes 
after. 
 
[/92./] 
Feare likewise gathers the heat and Spirits to 
the heart, and dissolves the Brayne, making the 
moysture thereof shed and slide downe into the 
externall parts, causing a chilnesse and shaking over 
all the Body; and falling upon the gullet, 
makes one to swallow when they should speake: 
It abuses the Fancie and Sences, brings a Lethargie 
[^p.36^] 
upon the Organs of motion, and condemnes 
the heart to deadly suffrings. 
 
[/93./] 
As CASSANDER the sonne of Antipater upon 
the sight of ALEXANDER the Great's statue, was 
stricken with such a terrour, that he could hardly 
make his legs leave trembling so farre as to carrie 
him out of the place. 
 
Nay to come nearer to our purpose. In the 
last great Plague-time here in London, in Anno Domini 
1625. One George Bicker-staffe a Taylor 
dwelling in Silver-Street, having charge of the 
house of the Right Honourable the Lord WINDSOR 
in Mugwell-streete, (where I then Lived) 
and comming thither one Evening in the twilight; 
as he was standing all alone in the Parlour, 
sudainly a great noyse came ratling downe the 
Stayres, from the upper roomes. At which (although 
my selfe have beene eye witnesse of manly 
valour in him at other times) hee was so beyond 
reason affrighted, that hee ran out of the 
house into the Street, halfe breathlesse, and almost 
speechlesse, looking very ghastly; which 
made many inquire the cause; which as soone as 
hee could make them understand, some boldly 
ventur'd in, and found nothing but a Fawne, that 
had been tyed up in the Garden, and was now got 
loose, and (the Hall doore being left open) had 
got up into the great Chamber. The neighbours 
made themselves merry with the Taylors manhood: 
But hee went home (it being the Fifteenth 
day of October) fell into a Feavor, which turned 
within a few dayes into the Plague, whereof hee 
[^p.37^] 
dyed on the Six and twentieth day of the same 
moneth: having continued in perfect health 
from the beginning of the Contagion to this 
fore-mentioned houre of his mis-informed feare. 
Now this Feare did not arise from danger of Infection, 
and yet it drew it on. How much more 
then does the feare of the same cause then worke 
it? I need bring no Examples for proofe: for in 
every place I heare living witnesses of such as dyed 
of the Plague, stricken onely with the feare of 
it: And therefore I cannot thinke any mans ignorance 
can plead against it. 
 
[/94./] 
Yet I will give a reason for it, because of all 
Passions, Feare is the most pestilently pernicious: 
And this it is: Feare enforces the vitall Spirits 
to retire inward to the heart: By which retyring 
they leave the outward parts infirme, as appeares 
plainly by the palenesse and trembling of one in 
great feare. So that the walls being forsaken 
(which are continually besieged by the outward 
ayre) in comes the enemy boldly; the best spirits 
that should expelled them having cowardly sounded 
retreat: In which with-drawing, they draw 
in with them such evill vapours as hang about the 
outward pores; even as the Sunne drawes toward 
it the vapours of the Earth. And hence it, that 
Feare brings Infection sooner then any other occasion. 
 
[/95./] 
This therefore; and all other Passions must (by 
a wise watching over our selves) be beaten off, 
whensoever they but offer to set upon us. But 
these are diseases of the Soule, whose Physicians 
[^p.38^] 
are Divines. They must Purge out the Love of 
this World, and the distrust of GODS Providence, 
minister the Cordials of Faith, Hope, Patience, and 
Contentednesse; and Ordaine the strict Dyet of Holy 
Exercises Wee that are Physitians to the Body, 
are but Chyrurgians to the Soule; wee can but 
talke of Topicall remedies; as to apply Mirth, 
Musicke, delightfull businesse, good Company, and 
lawfull Recreations; such as may take up all time 
from carefull thoughts and passionate affections: 
Then have wee done. And so have I now with 
the sixe Points of Dyet; and likewise with the 
first part of my Method, which is the way of Preservation. 
 
[/96./] 
The second Part (which now succeeds) discovers 
the Manner and Signes of being Infected. 
 
[/97./] 
The Manner is, that It strikes chiefly at the Heart, 
(as I sayd in the Definition:) which is apparent by 
this, that at the first Infection or instant of being 
taken, the vitall Faculty sinkes, and languishes, the 
whole strength of the Body is suddainly turned 
to weaknesse; the vitall Spirits are greatly oppressed 
and discouraged. Whereas the Animall Facultie 
commonly remaines (for a while) in good 
plight, and perfect in the use of Sense, Vnderstanding, 
Iudgement, Memory, and Motion. The Naturall 
Facultie also is not so presently hurt, but 
there is Concoction and all other functions performed 
by the Liver, Stomacke, Guts, Reynes, Bladder, 
and other parts, as Nature requireth. Though 
[^p.39^] 
indeed in a little time (the Venome being very 
strong) these and the Braine also are overcome. 
As appeares by the Symptomes that follow; as Lethargies, 
Frenzies: Vomitings, Fluxes, &c. which 
I shall reckon up in the Conclusion. 
 
Take notice therefore, That as soone as the venemous 
matter strikes to the Heart; that the Contagion 
has now found out the Prince of the Vitall 
parts: who if hee want armour of proofe to resist 
(eyther of Naturall strength, or forged out by 
Arts Cyclops, the Physitian) is presently taken prisoner 
by his venemous enemy; who soone after 
[/98./] 
takes possession of the Arteries, and Veynes. 
 
[/99./] 
In this conflict; the Pulse (which useth to be 
the truest intelligencer of the Hearts well or illfare) 
becomes now languishing, little, frequent, 
and unequall. Languishing, by reason that Native 
heate lessens, and a heate contrary to Nature 
increases: Little, because oppressed: Frequent, 
from Natures strife: Vnequall, partly from the 
Feavor, and partly from the Malignant vapour 
that besiedgeth the Heart. Concerning the Pulse 
also, Rodericus a Castro, de Peste Hamburgensi, has 
this Signe in these very words. Manus, dum 
Medico porrigunt Pulsum, quodam modo retrahuntur 
cum tremore; quod a veneno fit cor ipsum pungente, 
& Signum mihi diutina experientia indubitatum 
est, ut eo solo sæpissime Pestilentem affectum 
cognoverim. This have I also tryed and found 
true. 
 
And from this ground did I find another that 
[^p.40^] 
never fayled me; If in reaching out the hand the 
former signe appeared not; then if I suspected it 
to be the Plague, I would touch the Pulse something 
hard, and if it were the Plague it would not 
fayle Cum tremore manum retrahere. The reason 
is, the stopping of the course of the Pulse drives 
the venome something back to the heart, by which 
is caused a kind of suddaine Passion. 
 
[/100./] 
The next Signe is, the enemies Ensigne hung 
out at the windowes: The Eyes are various in 
turning, and sometimes fiery shining; the lookes 
sad, and the Face changing colour: which shew 
that the radicall humour begins to waste, and the 
Spirits to waxe dry and enflamed. 
 
[/101./] 
Then followeth Lightnesse of Giddinesse of the 
Head; Drouth, and Bitter tast in the mouth, which 
proceed from the superfluitie of Choller, aggravated 
by the mixture of the venemous vapours. 
 
[/102./] 
Vomiting likewise of vitious matter, being (according 
to redundancie of any of the humours) 
sometimes waterish, of Flegme; sometime yellow 
or greenish, of Choller; sometimes leaden or 
blackish, of Melancholy. But this is from the virulencie 
of the Venome, vexing the veynes and fibres 
in the coate of the Stomacke: not from any 
strength of Nature to expell the poyson; as appeareth 
in that no ease, but increase of accidents 
succeedeth the exoneration. 
 
[/103./] 
After which, followes a painfull Hicket, or Yexing; 
by the progresse of the venome working convulsively 
on the fibres of the Stomacke. 
 
[^p.41^] 
[/104./] 
Shortnesse of breath also, and often sighing shew 
the heart is enflamed, and would faine exchange 
the over-heated ayre within the body, for that 
which is coole without. 
 
[/105./] 
Then begin the Spirits to sink, through the fierce 
gripe of the venemous vapour that now insults 
over the yeilding heart. The externall parts become 
cold and shake-ripe, while the internall 
are over-hot with the inflammation of the 
Bowels. 
 
[/106./] 
By this time the venom is gotten up into the 
watrish humors of the Braine, and infecting them, 
causeth Head ache: while the hot vapours (getting 
betwixt the two mother membranes) cause 
[/107./] 
painefull prickings there, whereupon follow restlessenesse 
of the Body, and Lacke of Sleepe, and upon 
these Frenzie, except the Braine be full of 
moysture; and then the head is over-heavie and 
[/108./] 
Lethargick. 
 
Sometimes also the Venom workes it self from 
the substance of the Braine into the Sinewes, causing 
[/109./] 
Cramps, and Convulsions. 
 
[/110./] 
The Vrine is altogether untrue, therefore unworthy 
the fellowship of faithfull signes. And 
the most faithfull, are the Soares, and Spots (if they 
be right) called Gods Tokens. 
 
[/111./] 
But before we describe them, let me expresse 
my sorrow for what I had dayly observation of, 
in the last great Visitation. Many undertooke the 
cure of the Plague then, who knew no more then 
to sweat the Patient, and apply outward drawing 
medicines to the Soares: nay the Chyrurgerie worke 
[^p.42^] 
was well performed by some, and yet I dare say 
many dyed for the lacke of skill to encounter 
these symptomes now specified. And yet there 
are many moe such; all which I will reckon up, 
to see if I can shake the consciences of such impudent 
Quack-salvers, as dare without learning venture 
to enrich themselves by filling Graves. 
 
There is commonly, 
1 Trembling of the heart, fainting or sowning. 
2 A Feavor, though not easily discerned at first. 
3 Cardialgia, commonly called Heart-ache. 
4 Vomiting, and Loathing in the stomacke. 
5 Extreame Thirst, and vile taste in the Mouth. 
6 Head ache, and pricking paines there. 
7 Swimming, or Vertigo. 
8 Losse of Memorie, and Foolish behaviour. 
9 Want of sleepe. 10 Delirium, or Frenzy. 
11 Convulsions, or Cramps. 
12 Lethargie, or extreame Drowsinesse. 
13 Sharp paines in the Eares. 
14 Opthalmia, or inflamation of the Eyes. 
15 Bleeding at the Nose. 
16 The tongue and mouth enflam'd and furr'd. 
17 Spitting of Bloud. 
18 Squinansie. 19 Pleuresie. 
20 Very short Breath, and continuall sighing. 
21 Drye Cough. 22 Iaundise. 
23 Swelling of the Belly with externall paine. 
24 Colick, and Iliak Passions. 
25 Extreame Costinesse. 26 Wormes. 
27 Flux of the Belly: eyther Lieuteria, or Diarrhæa. 
28 Bloudy Flux. 
[^p.43^] 
29 Swelling of the Testicles very painefully. 
30 Suppression of Vrine. 
31 Extreame heate, and paine in the Backe. 
32 Swelling of the Feet and Legges with intollerable paine. 
33 And sometimes, Such immoderate Sweat 
horribly stinking, that it affrights the Physitian 
from his course of sweating the Patient, and yet 
for all this sweat the deadly danger increaseth. 
 
And not one of these Symptomes can bee cured 
by the common Method of such cases: Because of 
the venemous quality that is mixed with them. 
 
When I had well informed my selfe of these 
things, and saw how little they were regarded of 
others. I was stricken with wonder to see, with 
what peaceable consciences some men went a killing. 
And I began to doubt whether it were not 
better for a man to be at peace with Ignorance, 
then to carry his trembling heart in his hand, as I 
did al that time. Yet then it pleased God to blesse 
my labours and counsailes, and to let a very small 
number faile under my advice.
