[^Extract 1, pp. 1-21^] 
 
[^p.1^] 
[}An Excellent Medicine, to Prevent 
the PLAGUE.}] 
 
TAKE Sage of Vertue, Rue (otherwise 
called Hearb-Grace) Elder 
Leaves, Red Bramble Leaves, and 
VVormwood, of each of them a good 
handful; stamp them altogether, and then 
strain them through a fine Linnen Cloth; and 
put to the Juice a Quart of perfect good 
VVhite-VVine, and a good quantity of 
VVhite-VVine Vinegar: Mingle them all together, 
and put thereto a quarter of an Ounce 
of VVhite Ginger, beaten to small Powder. 
Use to drink this Medicine every Morning fasting, 
for the space of Nine Dayes together, 
the quantity of a spoonfull at a time, and 
this will (by Gods help) preserve you, 
for the space of a whole Year. 
 
[^p.2^] 
[}An approved Medicine after Infection.}] 
 
IF it fortune, that one be stricken with the 
Plague, before he hath taken the former 
Medicine; then take the things rehearsed, and 
put thereto a spoonful of Bettony VVater, and 
as much Scabios VVater, and a pretty quantity 
of fine Treacle, and temper them well together, 
and let the Patient use to drink it often, and it 
will expell the Venome or Poyson forthwith. 
But if the Botch do happen to appear, then 
take a good quantity of Elder Leaves, Red 
Bramble leaves, and Mustard Seed; stamp them 
well together, and make a Plaister thereof; apply 
it to the Sore, and it will draw forth all the 
Venome and Corruption. 
 
[}Those that fear the Plague, and are not Infected, 
let them take of this Drink hereafter following, 
which is twice in every Week, half a spoonful 
at a time: It hath been observed, that never 
any one dyed of the Sickness, that did take it in 
time.}] 
 
TAke three Pints of Malmsey, a handful of 
Rue, as much of Sage; boyl these to a 
Quart, then strain out the Herbs, and then take 
an Ounce of Long-Pepper, Vinegar and Nutmegs, 
all beaten small in a Morter, and put into 
[^p.3^] 
the VVine, and boyl it a little; then take it off, 
and put into it one Ounce of Mithridate, two 
Ounces of the best Treacle, and a quarter of a 
Pint of Aqua-Vitæ, and put all into the VVine, 
and so keep it. 
 
[}The Use of it.}] 
 
If any be Infected, take one spoonful of it 
as soon as the Party doth presume himself Infected, 
lukewarm; and so goe to Bed, and sweat 
two or three hours; and then dry the Body well, 
and keep warm, and drink no cold Drink, but 
warm Drink and Caudles, and Posset-Drink, 
with Marigold Leaves and Flowers: VVhen 
the Party hath sweat, and is well dryed with 
warm Clothes; and so long as the Party is ill, 
take a spoonful Morning and Evening. 
 
IF you fear you are Infected, or feel any Kernel 
rising, or any Apostumation burning or 
pricking, abstain from Sleep, for Sleep leadeth 
the Venome to the Heart. That Day that you 
are Infected, eat but little, or no Food; for evil 
Humours so fill you, that they take away your 
Stomack: Or if you do eat, then do you covet 
to sleep, and feel a great burning, with a 
kind of shuddering, as it were, through Cold: 
You have also a great Pain in the fore part of 
the Head: You cannot endure to ride, or to 
[^p.4^] 
walk, or any motion of the Body; but are dull, 
lumpish, and given wholly over to sadness and 
drowsiness. 
 
To prove, that these are Arguments, that 
you are Infected; let any Man, finding his Body 
in this Distemper, not stir or walk (which I 
counsel him to do; for to goe into the Air, and 
to use motion, keepeth the Poyson longer from 
the Heart) and he shall find within one half 
Day, some Impostume rising under his Armhole, 
in his Groyn, or behind his Ear. 
 
The first thing therefore (after you feel 
your self thus) is, with all speed, to be let 
blood; when you are let blood, sleep not all 
that Day; you must be let blood on the same 
side the Swelling appears, if so be the Impostume 
arise before you sleep: but if it prick after 
you have slept, then be let blood on the contrary 
side: As if there be a swelling under the 
left Arm, then be let blood on the right Arm, 
If thou art faint or weak after letting blood, 
then sleep a little, yet every half hour stir thy 
Body too and fro. If the Impostume wax bigger 
and bigger, it is a good sign that the Venome is 
driven from the Heart, and will come forth. 
To ripen it, do thus; Stamp Leaves of Elder, 
and mix that Juice with Mustard-Seed; of this 
make a Plaister, and lay it on the Swelling. 
 
[^p.5^] 
[}These Things ought duly to be looked unto, viz.}] 
 
IT is very convenient, that you keep your 
Houses, Streets, Yards, back-sides, Sinks and 
Kennells sweet and clean, from all standing 
Puddles, Dunghills, and corrupt Moystures, 
which ingender stinking Savours, that may be 
noysome, or breed Infection. Nor suffer no 
Doggs to come running into your Houses; neither 
keep any, except it be backward, in some 
Place of open Air; for they are very dangerous, 
and not sufferable in time of Sickness, by reason 
they run from Place to Place, and from one 
House to another, feeding upon the uncleanest 
things, that are cast forth in the Streets; and are 
a most apt Cattel to take Infection of any Sickness, 
and then to bring it into the House. 
 
[}For Ayring your Rooms.}] 
 
Ayr your several Rooms with Charcole-fires, 
made in Stone Panns or Chaffing dishes, and not 
in Chimneys; set your Panns in the middle of 
the Rooms; ayr every Room once a VVeek (at 
the least) and put into your Fire a little quantity 
of Frankincense, Juniper, dryed Rosemary, 
or of Bay-Leaves. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}To Smell to.}] 
 
The Root of Enula-Campana, steeped in Vinegar, 
and lapped in a Handkerchief, is a special 
thing to smell unto, if you come where the 
Sickness is. 
 
[}To taste or chew in the Mouth.}] 
 
The Root of Angelica, Setwall, Gencian, Valerian, 
or Cinnamon, is a special Preservative against 
the Plague, being chewed in the Mouth. 
 
[}To Eat.}] 
 
Eat Sorrel, steeped in Vinegar, in the Morning 
fasting, with a little Bread and Butter. Sorrel 
Sauce is also very wholesome against the 
same. 
 
[}To Drink.}] 
 
Take Rue, VVormwood and Scabios, steep'd 
in Ale a whole Night, and drink it fasting every 
Morning. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
The Root of Enula-Campana, beaten to 
Powder, is a special Remedy against the Plague, 
being drank fasting. 
 
[^p.7^] 
[}Another.}] 
 
If any feel themselves already Infected, take 
Angelica, mixt with Mithridatium; drink it off, 
then goe to Bed, and sweat thereon. 
 
[}Another special Preservative.}] 
 
Take an Egge, make a hole in the top of it, 
take out the white, and the yolk, and fill the 
shell only with Saffron; roast the shell and Saffron 
together, in Embers of Charcole, untill the 
shell wax yellow; then beat shell and all together 
in a Morter, with half a spoonful of Mustard-Seed: 
Now so soon as any suspition is had 
of Infection, dissolve the weight of a French 
Crown, in ten spoonfulls of Posset-Ale, drink 
it luke-warm, and sweat upon it in your naked 
Bed. 
 
[}Drink for ordinary Dyet.}] 
 
So near as you can, let the Patients ordinary 
Drink, be good small Ale, of eight dayes old. 
 
[}For Vomiting.}] 
 
Vomiting is better than Bleeding, in this 
Case; and therefore provoke to Vomit, so near 
as you can. 
 
[}To provoke Vomit.}] 
 
Take three Leaves of Estrabecca, stamp it, & 
drink it in Rhenish VVine, Ale, or Posset-Ale. 
 
[^p.8^] 
[}For Purging.}] 
 
If the Party be full of gross Humours, let 
him blood immediately upon the right Arm, on 
the Liver Vein, or in the Median Vein, in the 
same Arm; so as no Sore appear the first Day. 
 
[}A very wholesome Water, to be Distilled.}] 
 
Steep Sorrel in Vinegar four and twenty 
hours; then take it out, and dry it with a Linnen 
Cloth; then Still it in a Limbeck; drink four 
spoonfulls, with a little Sugar; walk upon it till 
you sweat, if you may: if not, keep your Bed, 
upon it. Use this before Supper on 
any Evening. If the Patient happen to be 
troubled with any Swellings, Botches, Carbuncle, 
let him sweat moderately now and then. 
 
[}Outward Medicines to Ripen the Sore.}] 
 
Take the Root of a White Lilly, roast it in a 
good handful of Sorrel; stamp it, and apply it 
thereto very hot, let it lye four and twenty 
hours, and it will break the Sore. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take a small quantity of Leaven, a handful of 
Mallows, a little quantity of Scabios, cut a white 
Onion into pieces, with half a Dozen Heads of 
Garlick; boyl these together in running Water, 
[^p.9^] 
make a Poultess of it, and then lay it hot to the 
Sore. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take a hot Loaf, new taken forth of the 
Oven, apply it to the Sore, and it will doubtless 
break the same: but afterward bury the same 
Loaf deep enough in the Ground, for fear of any 
Infection; for if either Dogg, or any other 
thing, do feed thereon, it will infect a great 
many. 
 
[}For Ayring Apparel.}] 
 
Let the Apparel of the Diseased Persons be 
well and often washed, be it Linnen or Woollen; 
or let it be ayred in the Sun, or over Panns 
of Fire, or over a Chaffingdish of Coals; and 
fume the same with Frankincense, Juniper, or 
dryed Rosemary. 
 
[}To Preserve from the Infection of the Plague.}] 
 
Take Garlick, and peel it, and mince it small, 
put it into new Milk, and eat it fasting. 
 
[}To take the Infection from a House Infected.}] 
 
Take large Onions, peel them, and lay three 
or four of them upon the Ground; let them lye 
ten Dayes, and those peeled Onions will gather 
all the Infection into them, that is in one of 
those Rooms: But bury those Onions afterward 
deep in the Ground. 
 
[^p.10^] 
[}Against the new Burning Feaver.}] 
 
if the Patient be in great heat, as most commonly 
they will; take of fair running Water, a 
pretty quantity; put it on a Chaffingdish of 
Coals; then put thereinto a good quantity of 
Saunders, beaten to Powder, and let it boyl half 
an hour, between two Dishes; that done, put a 
couple of soft Linnen Clothes into a Dish, wet 
the Cloths well in Water and Saunders, and apply 
the same, as hot as you can suffer it, to your 
Belly. 
 
[}To procure Sleep to the Sick Persons, that are 
Diseased, either with the Plague, 
or the hot Feaver.}] 
 
Take of Womans Breast-Milk, a good quantity; 
put thereunto the like quantity of Aqua-Vitæ; 
stir them well together, and moysten 
therewith the Temples of the Patient, and his 
Nostrills; lay it on with some Feather, or some 
fine thin Ragg. 
 
Butter-Milk, in this Contagious Time, is 
generally wholesome to be eaten; and is a good 
Preservative, against either the Plague, or the 
Pestilent Feaver. 
 
[^p.11^] 
[}A 
PRAYER 
Against the 
PLAGUE.}] 
 
OMnipotent God, and most merciful 
Father, bow down thine Ear to 
our Requests, and let thy gracious Eye 
look upon the Miseries of thy People. A 
long time have the Vials of thy Wrath 
been held open, and have powred thy 
Divine Vengeance on our sinful heads. 
O Lord, we confess, that Sodom and Gomorrah, 
were never so wicked, as we have 
been, and are still: The Jewes were never 
so hard-hearted towards thee (our 
God) as we are; who hourly Crucifie 
thy Son Jesus Christ, in our vile Bodies. 
[^p.12^] 
Yet behold, we cry to thee for Mercy; we 
repent what is past, and are contrite and 
sorry, that we have been stubborn Children, 
to a Father so mild, and ready to 
pardon. Stay therefore thine Arm, and 
let not the Arrow of Death, strike our 
Young Men into their Graves, nor our 
Old Men to the Earth. Call home thy 
Angells of Wrath, whom thou hast sent 
forth, and let no more of thy People perish, 
under the heavy Strokes of This 
Dreadful Plague, which is now a Dweller 
amongst us. Grant this our Request, and 
all other whatsoever, needful to Soul or 
Body, for his sake, in whose Name thou 
denieth nothing, Amen. 
 
[^p.13^] 
[}A 
PRAYER, 
For those that are not Visited.}] 
 
OH most Mighty and Merciful Lord 
God, in whose hands are health 
and sickness, who at thy pleasure canst 
kill and comfort; I do confess, that my 
Sins call louder for Justice, than I can 
cry for Mercy; and I deserve all Plagues 
and Punishments, in this Life, and the 
Plague of Plagues, in the Life to come, 
Damnation both of Body and Soul: But, 
O Lord, be thou more merciful, than 
I can be sinful; and in Jesus Christ be 
reconciled unto me, and purge me, and 
cleanse me from all my sins. And I beseech 
thee, Oh heavenly Father, at 
whose Commandement the Angells passed 
[^p.14^] 
over the Houses of the Israelites, 
when it struck the Egyptians (if it be thy 
blessed will) that this present Sickness 
may pass over me, and my Family. We 
do confess, O Lord, that I and others 
have deserved the Plagues of Egypt; but, 
O Lord, howsoever keep us from the 
greatest Plague, which is hardness of 
heart; and if it be thy pleasure, withhold 
thy heavy hand from us. Do not 
correct us in thine anger, nor yet chastise 
us in thy heavy displeasure; but in 
thy mercy release us. And if it be good 
unto thee, that I and others should taste 
of this birter Cup, strengthen our Faith, 
increase our Hope, augment our Patience; 
that so we may rest in thy Peace, 
rise in thy Power, and remain in thy 
Glory; and that for Christ Jesus sake, 
in whose Name we further call upon 
thee, saying, Our Father, which art in 
Heaven, &c. 
 
[^p.15^] 
[}A 
PRAYER, 
For those that are Visited.}] 
 
OH Lord God, thou best Physician, 
both of our Souls and Bodies, 
who canst bring to the Grave, and pull 
back again, whom thou pleasest; which 
wert moved at the Prayers of Moses for others, 
of Ezekiah for himself; O Lord, 
hear me for others, others for me, and 
all of us for thy Son; and look with the 
Eye of mercy upon me, whom it hath 
pleased thee, at this time, to visit with 
the Plague and Sickness: O Lord, I 
am held in thy fetters; Oh thou which 
hast bound me, loose me; and, if it tend 
unto thy glory, and my good, restore 
my health unto me. O Lord, I have 
[^p.16^] 
been an unprofitable Servant all my Life 
time: Oh then, let me not then be bereft 
of the Life of Nature, when I begin 
the Life of Grace; but if thou hast 
disposed of me otherwise, increase my 
Patience with my Pains; shew thy 
strength in sustaining my weakness, and 
be my strong Fortress, in this hour of my 
Tryal; give me grace to apprehend and 
apply all the merits and mercies of 
Christ unto my Soul; and, O Lord, let 
thy Comforter oppose the Tempter, in 
such a measure, that he may not prevail 
against me; but as thou makest me 
like Lazarus, full of Sores, so let also 
thy Angells carry me into Abrahams bosome. 
O Lord, I intreat, let me obtain, 
even for his sake, for whom thou 
hast promised, and bound thy self, to 
hear and help the afflicted, even thy 
Son, and my Saviour, Christ Jesus: 
To whom, with thee, and thy blessed 
Spirit, be all Praise, &c. 
 
[^p.17^] 
[}Meditation 1.}] 
 
IT cannot chuse but be a grief unto a Christian, 
to see how many murmur in this Visitation; 
some fearing the Plague in their Persons, 
others in their Purses; some being loth to lose 
their Goods, others to leave the World, not 
fearing to say with despairing Cain, their Punishment 
is greater than they can bear; and 
thus do they undervalue Gods Mercy in his Justice, 
in whose Vial is not only Wine, but also 
Oyl: Had he delivered us up to Famine, it 
would have been a Burthen farr more grievous; 
and had he delivered us up into the hands of 
our Enemies, as he hath done some Neighbouring 
Nations, it had been likely, that we 
should not only have been banished from our 
Country, but that all hope should have been 
banished from us: How much better is it then, 
as David chose, to fall into the hand of God, 
than into the hands of Men; and to be visited 
with this Plague, than to be Plagued with our 
Enemies: The Lord give us grace to repent and 
amend, that he may cease to afflict us; and grant, 
that being once cleansed, we may sin no more, 
lest a worse Evil happen unto us. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[}Meditation 2.}] 
 
IT is true indeed, that Sin was the first Cause 
of this Sickness; but as God doth not the 
Works of Mercy, so he doth not the Works of 
Justice, without a means. Our Sins were the 
Parents of this Pestilence, but it is a question, 
how God brought it in, there is no Man can absolutely 
determine, but many may conjecture, 
And (I fear me) it was the want of Charity, 
and the neglect of the Poor, in this City, which 
partly caused this Infection; for how can it be 
otherwise, but that, where multitudes are pestered 
together in a little room, and in it have 
but little comfort; as no Raggs, to cover their 
nakedness; no Linnen to shift them from filthiness, 
it cannot chuse but cause them noysomeness, 
and by consequence Infection: If then 
the rich Men desire to leave to be miserable, let 
them learn to be merciful, and free the City 
from the multitudes of Poor. 
 
[}Meditation 3.}] 
 
IT is strange thing, to see the difference of 
Men; and to consider, how the Seed of 
Andam, being composed of the same Matter, 
should so differ in Manners: For here you may 
[^p.19^] 
see one so timerous of Sickness, that he dares 
not goe to Church, for fear of Infection; being 
so full of base Cowardise, that he is fearful to 
gather a Rose, lest he should prick his Fingers; 
neglecting his Souls welfare, for fear of his Bodies 
sickness; notwithstanding, he can trudge to 
Westminster, about Quarrels and Contentions. 
But on the contrary side, another so audacious 
and presumptuous, that he seemeth to challenge 
the Pestilence, and seeketh it at Playes, searcheth 
it from one Tavern to another, as if he 
dared Gods Judgements to encounter with him; 
both of which are extreme Follies. We must 
part, viz. from our frail Life. I will therefore 
resolve, not so much to fear the Evil of Sickness, 
as to commit the Evil of Sin; neither so 
much Sin, as to seek out Sickness: The one is a 
sin against my Soul, to deprive it of the Food 
which is offered; and Tantalus like, to starve it 
under the means: The other is a sin against my 
Body, to seek to impair the health of it; but 
howsoever, both of them against God: The 
one being Timidity, the other Timerity; the 
one Fear, the other Folly; the one shewing 
himself faint-hearted, the other fool-hardy. 
 
[^p.20^] 
[}A Remedy, sent to the Lord Mayor of 
London, by King Henry the Eighth, 
against the PLAGUE.}] 
 
TAKE a handful of Sage, a handful of 
Hearb-Grace, a handful of Elder Leaves, 
a handful of Red Bramble Leaves; stamp them 
all, and strain them through a fine Cloath, with 
a quart of VVhite-VVine; and then take a 
quantity of Ginger, and mingle them together, 
and take a spoonful of the same, and you shall be 
safe for twenty four Dayes; Nine times taking of 
it, is sufficient for a whole Year, by the Grace of 
God. And if it be so, that the Party be stricken 
with the Plague, before he hath drank this 
Medicine, then take the Water of Scabios a 
spoonful, of Water of Bettony a spoonful, and a 
quantity of fine Triacle; and put them all together, 
and cause him to drink it, and it will expell 
all the Venome. If the Fotch appear, then 
take the Leaves of Brambles, Elder Leaves, Mustard 
Seed, and stamp them together, and make 
a Plaister thereof, and lay it to the Sore, and that 
shall draw out the Venome, and the Party shall be 
whole, by the Grace of God. 
 
[^p.21^] 
[}M. H. Receipt against the Plague.}] 
 
TAke Setwel Root, to the quantity of 
half a Walnut, and grave it; of 
Triacle-Jean, one good spoonful; of 
Wine-Vinegar, three good spoonfulls; of 
fair Water, three spoonfulls: Make these 
more than luke-warm, and so drink them 
off warm in your Bed, and sweat six or 
seven hours after. Drink Posset-Ale, 
made with small Drink, as your thirst 
requireth; so that you expect an hour 
and a half, after the Potion taking, before 
your first drinking, and it will drive 
forth the Plague. Let the Posset-Ale be 
luke-warm, at the first draughr, but after 
as you like it, so it be not quite cold. 
 
These two Medicines have Cured above a 
thousand People, in this City, the last Plague 
time; And none hath took it in time, but scaped.
