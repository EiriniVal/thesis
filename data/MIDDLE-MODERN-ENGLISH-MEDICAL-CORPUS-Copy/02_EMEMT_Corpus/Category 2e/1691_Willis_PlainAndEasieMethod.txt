[^Extract 1, pp. 1-74^] 
 
[^p.1^] 
[}A Plain and Easie 
METHOD, &c.}] 
 
IN time of Pestilence, because 
a Physician cannot 
easily, or often, be consulted 
with; Therefore it 
behoveth all Persons, as well 
Poor as Rich, to be furnish'd 
with Remedies against that Contagious 
Disease; and certain Rules, 
or a Method how to use them: 
Which Method being very plain, 
and almost the same to all 
People, consists chiefly in these 
[^p.2^] 
two Parts, viz: How to preserve 
the Whole from takeing 
Infection; And how to 
cure the Sick that are infected. 
 
Touching the First; Though 
the surest way is to fly from it, 
yet in regard this cannot be done 
by all, some Means should be 
us'd to secure [so far as it is possible] 
those that are forced to 
stay by it. Such Means of Prevention, 
either concern the 
Publick Magistrate, which are 
already sufficiently known, and 
commonly practis'd in all places 
that are infected, and it would 
be superfluous to repeat them 
here; Or else such as belong to 
private Persons, what ways every 
Man that lives in, or near 
an infected place, may arm himself 
[^p.3^] 
against the danger of Contagion; 
Which should be endeavour'd, 
as well by purifying 
the Air we breathe, as also by 
fortifying our selves against 
taking the Infection at our 
Nostrils, Mouth, or Pores of 
the Body, which are the chiefest, 
if not the only parts the Poison 
creeps in at. 
 
That the Air we breathe in 
may be wholesome, all Things, 
that may advance or add to the 
corruption of it, should diligently 
be removed; our Houses, and 
Streets kept clean; all Filth, and 
whatever may cause noisom 
smells, be taken away; and amongst 
other things, the smell of 
Sope-Suds, and Lye, in the washing 
of Clothes, be avoided; this, 
Experience has taught to be very 
[^p.4^] 
dangerous; as 'tis observed by 
Diemerbroek and Uander Heyden. 
 
Besides the suppressing of Vapours 
that may increase the infection 
of the Air, it is to be 
purg'd of that Malignity it brings 
with it from other infected places; 
and this is done by great 
Fires, which should be continually 
kept, except the Weather be 
too hot, and by Fumes of Sulphur, 
Nitre, Frankincense, Pitch, 
Rosin, Tarr, and the like, which 
every day should be burnt in 
the Room we most frequent, also 
before our Doors, and on the 
tops of our Houses. Of simple 
Medicines to be us'd for this purpose, 
Brimstone is commended 
for the best that is; 'Tis likely 
that Vitriol, which partakes much 
[^p.5^] 
of the like acid Spirit, may be 
very proper; but in regard 'tis 
not easily combustible, make 
this mixture, and strew of 
it on Coals in a hot Chafing-dish. 
 
Take green Vitriol calcin'd, 
Saltpeter, and 
Sulphur, of each a 
pound, beat them well 
together, and keep it for 
use. 
 
In close Rooms, and in hot 
Weather, Vinegar with Rue, 
or Wormwood, chopt small, 
and evaporated in a perfuming 
Pot; or else Pestilential Vinegar 
[as we shall describe] 
thrown on a hot Brick. Or 
[^p.6^] 
take Myrrh, Galbanum, Ammoniac, 
of each half an 
Ounce; boyl these in a Quart, 
or three Pints of White-Wine 
Vinegar, 'till they 
are all dissolv'd; put half a 
spoonful of this at a time 
on a hot Brick. 
 
Some commend Slakeing of 
Lime, supposing the fume that 
ariseth from it, may purifie the 
Air: 'Tis possible, if this be done 
with Vinegar, either simple, or 
impregnated with Alexipharmacal 
Medicines, it may be more effectual. 
 
Next to the Cure of the Air, 
to render that as wholesom as 
we can; we must arm our selves 
against taking in that Malignity, 
which [notwithstanding all means 
[^p.7^] 
or purifying it] shall still remain 
mixt with it. Now because the 
Spirits are commonly the first 
that receive Infection; We must 
fortifie them, that they may not 
easily admit the approaches of 
their Enemy, which when they 
are in full vigour and expansion, 
they will repel, and as it were 
keep off at a distance; Therefore 
Wine and Confidence are a 
good Preservative against the 
Plague: But when the Spirits, 
through fear, or want of supply, 
do recede, and are forc'd 
to give back, the Enemy enters, 
and first seizeth them, and thence 
gets into the Blood and Humors; 
Therefore much Fasting 
and Emptiness are bad: But 
every one should Eat and Drink 
at convenient Hours, in such 
[^p.8^] 
manner and measure, as may 
always keep the Spirits lively 
and chearful, and endeavour to 
compose his Mind and Affection 
against fear and sadness. 
 
But besides keeping the Spirits 
in a good height, and more 
especially when that cannot be 
done, as in Persons that are 
naturally fearful, and of a tender 
Constitution, the Spirits 
should constantly, as it were, be 
kept arm'd with such Remedies 
as resist the Poyson; that is, 
the use of proper Antidotes against 
the Plague. 
 
I shall set down some Preservatives 
to be taken of every 
Morning, and again at Night, 
by those that live in infected 
places. 
 
[^p.9^] 
Take of Conserve of Wood-Sorrel 
four Ounces; 
Confectio Liberans, 
and Mithridate, of 
each half an Ounce; 
Salt of Wormwood 
two Drams; Confection 
of Hyacinth one Dram; 
Tormentil Roots, and 
fine Bole, of each half 
a Dram; Pestilential 
Vinegar half an Ounce; 
mix all with Syrup of 
Citron; Take as much 
as a Nutmeg, Night 
and Morning. 
 
[^p.10^] 
For the Poorer Sort, that Medicine 
of the Ancients, may be 
proper, viz. 
 
Take of Rue two handfuls, 
Figs and Walnut-Kernels, 
of each twenty 
four, common Salt half 
an Ounce; Which beat 
all together in a Mortar, 
till it be well mix'd; 
Take of it as much as a 
Nutmeg every Morning 
and Night. 
 
This Medicine may be several 
ways advanc'd, by adding some 
Alexipharmacal Remedies to it, 
as by putting Salt of Wormwood, 
[^p.11^] 
instead of common Salt, and 
by adding an Ounce of Venice 
Treacle, to the whole Composition. 
 
For those that cannot take an 
Electuary, these Tablets may be 
proper to eat, about one Dram 
at a time, two or three times 
a day. 
 
Take of the Roots of Virginian-Snakeweed, 
Zedoary, Contrayerva, 
Species Liberans, 
of each two 
Drams; Camphire 
two Drams; mix all 
finely pouder'd, then dissolve 
eight Ounces of 
[^p.12^] 
fine Sugar in Pestilential 
Vinegar; Boyl 
it Candy high, and adding 
the Pouder to 
it, make all into Lozenges. 
 
For some that are of a hotter 
Constitution, and a high 
Sanguine Temper, it may be 
proper to take every Morning a 
spoonful of Pestilential Vinegar in 
a little Carduus water, or plain 
Wallnut water; or else drink a 
draught of Posset-Drink, made 
with a Spoonful of that Vinegar. 
 
Let the Pestilential Uinegar 
be made thus. 
 
[^p.13^] 
Take of the Roots of Angelica, 
Butter-Burr, 
Tormentil, Elecampane, 
of each half an Ounce, 
Virginian -- Snake-Weed, 
choice Zedoary, 
Contrayerva, of 
each three Drams; 
Leaves of Scordium, 
Rue, Goats-Rue, of 
each one handful; Marigold 
Flowers, Clove-gilloflowers, 
of each 
half a handful; Seeds 
of Citron and Carduus, 
of each two Drams; 
Cut and bruise these, and 
[^p.14^] 
put them in a Glass-Bottle, 
with three Pints of 
the best Vinegar, to 
digest for ten days. 
 
When the Stomach, by frequent 
taking of one sort of 
Antidote, begins to loath it: 
In such Cases the use of it may 
be changed into some other: 
And if the Stomach withal should 
be ill, and defective, in Appetite 
and Digestion; let the Party take 
every Morning, ten or twelve 
Drops of Elixir Proprietatis, 
in plain Wormwood Water, or else 
in Wormwood Wine. 
 
Those that have Coughs, and 
ill Lungs, may take five or six 
Drops of Balsum of Sulphur, 
made thus. 
 
[^p.15^] 
Take Flower of Sulphur, 
two Ounces, melt it in an 
Earthen Dish glaz'd on 
the fire, then put to it 
two Ounces of Salt of 
Wormwood; stir it 
for a Quarter of an Hour, 
taking care that it does 
not catch fire; Then put 
into it of Aloes, Myrrh, 
Olibanum, finely pouder'd, 
of each one Dram, 
of Saffron half a Dram; 
Keep this stirring half a 
Quarter of an Hour; 
Take it off, and put half 
an Ounce of it pouder'd, 
[^p.16^] 
to digest in five or six 
Ounces of good Spirit 
of Wine; It will take 
in a short time a very 
excellent Tincture: Which 
keep for use. 
 
Or else this Balsam may be 
made with Spiritus Theriacalis 
Camphoratus, and so will be 
more effectual against the Plague, 
Or which is more applicable to 
use, 
 
Put an Ounce of that Pouder 
newly made, into a 
pretty large Glass, and 
put to it a Quart of 
[^p.17^] 
good Sack; Set it in a 
gentle heat, for three or 
four Hours, it will take 
a Tincture: And of this 
one may take half a Spoonful 
at a time: And I 
suppose two Spoonfuls in 
a convenient Vehicle, 
may be a good Sudorifick 
to be given one that is 
infected. 
 
Though Purging in time of 
Pestilence is not good, as Diemerbroek 
by frequent Examples 
has observ'd, yet in Cachochymick 
Bodies, it may be convenient 
once in a fortnight, to take a 
Dose of Pillulæ Ruffi; Take 
[^p.18^] 
half a Dram at Night, and next 
Morning take the wonted Antidote, 
as at other times. 
 
Also for those that live in an 
infected Air, that there is suspicion 
that they may daily take in some 
pestiferous Vapours, which fermenting 
with the Blood and 
Humours, may insensibly at last 
break out in the Plague; it 
may not be amiss, once or 
twice a week, to take pretty 
large Sweats in their Beds: 
And this to be done, especially 
if the Party has had any occasion 
whereby he may suspect himself 
to have been more open to 
infection, or that he has taken any: 
After such Sweat he should keep 
his Chamber the forepart of the 
day, till the Pores are reduc'd to 
be as they were before. 
 
[^p.19^] 
To provoke such a Sweat: 
Take of Venice Treacle, 
one Dram; dissolve 
it in three Ounces of 
Carduus Water, add 
a Spoonful of Syrup 
of Pestilential Vinegar; 
Or take a Draught of 
Posset-Drink, made with 
Pestilential Vinegar; 
In which boyl a few Petasitis 
Roots: To promote 
and continue the 
Sweat, take Posset-Drink 
with Meadow-Sweet, 
or else with Carduus, 
or Marigold-Flowers 
boyl'd in it. 
 
[^p.20^] 
Besides the daily and constant 
use of such Alexipharmacal Remedies, 
there are other Means, 
which occasionally and sometimes 
continually shoulde be taken. 
For in regard we always draw 
in the Air at our Nostrils and 
Mouth, these parts should be 
well guarded with some Antidotes, 
that may keep out the poysonous 
Vapours from entring in, 
and especially as often as upon occasion 
we are more nearly expos'd 
to danger of Infection. To this 
end, some things to smell to, others 
to be held in the Mouth, 
chew'd, and swallow'd down, are 
frequently to be insisted on. 
 
That which seems at once to fulfil 
most of these intentions, is taking 
of Tobacco in a Pipe; the Smoke 
of this secures those parts which 
[^p.21^] 
lye openest, and at once intercepts 
the Contagion from the 
Brain, Lungs, and Stomach: Nay 
more than this, it stirs the Blood 
and Spirits all the Body over, and 
makes them shake off any poysonous 
Matter that adher'd to them: 
Insomuch that Diemerbroek accounts 
it not only a Preservative, 
but tells us, that himself, when 
he was several times infected, by 
taking five or six Pipes of Tobacco 
together was presently cur'd. And 
amongst us in England 'tis reported, 
That in the last great Plague, 
no Tobacco-Shop was infected: 
If 'tis not of so great virtue still 
amongst us, the reason is, because 
most Men have been accustomed 
to take is so excessively; 
wherefore it is grown so familiar 
to them, that it produceth no alteration 
[^p.22^] 
when it should be us'd as 
an Antidote. 
 
Besides the frequent use of Tobacco, 
which doubtless in time of 
Plague may be profitable for them 
that can take it; others, and also Tobacconists, 
at some times should be 
furnished with something to smell 
to when they pass through infected 
Places. Wormwood and Rue, Galbanum, 
Castor and Vinegar are good: 
The vulgar practice of putting 
Mithridate, or Treacle, or Tar in 
their Nostrils, may be very useful; 
or to have a Pomander to carry in 
ones hand, or put into the top of 
a Staff. 
 
Take of the Roots of Contrayerva 
and Virginian-Snakeweed 
pouder'd, 
[^p.23^] 
of each Two Drams; 
of the best Myrrh pouder'd, 
half an Ounce; of 
Camphire half a Dram. 
Let it be made a Pouder. 
 
Part of this may be enclos'd in 
a fine Silk Bag, and oftentimes 
dip it in Pestilential Vinegar, and 
so smell to it. To the other part of 
this, add Oyl of Nutmegs by Expression, 
and Oyl of Cap-ivy, of 
each a Dram, or as much as will 
make it into a Mass; also add 
of Balsam of Peru one Scruple. 
Dip Cotton Wool in Elixir Proprietatis, 
inclose it in fine Silk, and 
put it in the head of a Staff, or 
Civet Box, to smell to. 
 
For Medicines to hold in the 
Mouth, and chew on, Roots of 
[^p.24^] 
Zedoary, Contrayerva, and Snakeweed 
are very good; also Roots of 
Enulacampane, Angelica, and Master-wort; 
these either alone, or macerated 
in Vinegar, and dried again. 
Myrrh is very excellent: 
Some commend Tobacco, and 
chew it almost continually. 
 
These are the chiefest Remedies 
which help to keep Infection out 
of the Body. There is yet another 
sort which serves to let it out, 
and carry it away, before it grows 
to a head, viz. Issues, which have 
been found by often experience 
to be good Preservatives in time 
of Plague: For as much as Nature 
having a constant vent for 
excrementitious matter thrown off 
the Blood, by the same way expels 
poysonous Atoms soon after 
they are receiv'd into the Body. 
 
[^p.25^] 
Concerning Rules of Diet I 
need not say much, because such 
Precepts are commonly known: 
'Tis to be observ'd in general, that 
only wholsome Food should be 
taken: Very salt Meats, as hang'd 
Beef, Bacon, Pork, salt Fish, also 
shell-Fish, most kind of Herbage 
and raw Fruit should be avoided. 
The Meals should be moderate, 
and eaten in due season. Some 
Antidotal Things may be taken 
with the Meat, or mix'd in the 
Sauce; Clove Gilloflowers pickled, 
also Citron Peel and Juice, 
Rasberries, Currants, Pomegranate 
Juices, Pestilential Vinegar, and Mustard, 
made with the Seeds of Thlaspi, 
may be of some good effect. 
 
These kind of Remedies, and 
manner of living, ought chiefly 
to be insisted on as Preservatives 
[^p.26^] 
against the Plague. Those that 
are timorous and of tender Constitutions 
require a support from 
the use of more means; whereas 
Persons that are strong, and of a 
bold temper, have need of the less 
Remedies. But 'tis not safe for any 
to be so confident as to dare to 
converse with infected People, or 
live in the midst of Contagion 
without any Antidote at all. 
 
In the use of means, caution is 
to be had, that strong and hot Cordials 
be not too often taken, nor 
yet indifferently by all People; for 
that will inflame the Blood, and 
make it apt to kindle a Fever, which 
at such times soon turns to the 
Plague. 
 
The like caution is to be had 
against immoderate drinking of 
Wine; though a moderate proportion 
[^p.27^] 
chears and fortifies the 
Spirits, yet too much greatly disorders 
them, and thereby People 
are more expos'd to take Infection. 
 
Letting of Blood in time of 
Plague has been observ'd to be very 
pernicious; so also oft or 
strong Purging; for the Veins 
being emptied either way, will 
readily suck in whatever poysonous 
Atoms lurk in the outward 
Pores of the Body, which being 
admitted, become the more prevalent, 
because the Spirits being 
depauperated, are less able to subdue 
or repel them. 
 
Thus much of the way of Preservation: 
Next we are to treat 
of the Cure of those that are infected. 
 
The Cure of the Plague admits 
of no Delay; neither indeed 
[^p.28^] 
is there need of any deliberation 
what ought to be done; 
but as soon as any one finds 
himself infected, let him forthwith 
take to his Bed, and having 
pray'd to Almighty God for 
his Blessing, begin to use the 
Means. 
 
If the Party is much oppress'd 
at his Stomach, and strains to 
vomit, or else with vomiting 
throws up bitter and stinking 
Matter; let him presently take 
a large draught of Carduus, or 
Camomile Posset-Drink, and in 
it either half a Dram of Salt of 
Vitriol, or two Ounces of Liquor 
of Squills, and with his finger or 
a Feather, fetch up what is contain'd 
in his Stomach; but take 
no Antimonial Medicine, that 
will work beyond the Stomach. 
[^p.29^] 
As soon as he has vomited, [or if 
there is no occasion for this Evacuation] 
let him presently be 
put into a Sweat, and continue 
for twelve hours, more or less, 
according as his strength will 
hold out, and not sleep in 
it, or not till the latter end 
of it. 
 
If when he begins to Sweat, 
or endeavours it, his Vomiting 
still persists, then apply to the 
pit of the Stomach a Toast of 
White-Bread, spread over with 
Treacle or Mithridate, and dipt 
in Claret-Wine or Pestilential Vinegar, 
made Scalding hot in a 
Peuter Dish; Wrap this in fine 
Linnen, and apply it very hot. 
 
After a plentiful Sweat for 
twelve, fourteen, or eighteen 
hours, give him some Refective, 
[^p.30^] 
as Broth, Caudle, Mace-drink, or 
the like; and a little while after 
suffer him to sleep if he can. Then 
give him temperate Cordials by 
way of Confection or Julep, or 
both; which repeat every third or 
fourth hour: Also at the time 
that the Party settles to sleep, lay 
Vesicatory Plaisters behind the Ears, 
and under the Arm-pits, and also 
in the Groin. 
 
After he has slept, or endeavour'd 
it, and his Spirits are pretty 
well refresh'd, at a moderate 
distance from the first sweating, 
viz. Eighteen, or Four and Twenty 
hours, sooner or later, according 
as Symptoms are more or less 
urgent, and his strength is able, 
repeat the Sweating again; and 
so proceed through the whole 
Cure; one while Sweating, and 
[^p.31^] 
another while refreshing his Spirits 
by temperate Cordials and 
Sleep; betwixt whiles administring 
fit Nourishment, until such 
time as the Symptoms are abated 
wholly, and either the Disease 
terminated, or else the Malignity 
is driven all out in Boyls or 
Carbuncles; which how they 
must be order'd, shall be set 
down. 
 
Though the same kind of Sudorificks 
may be given indifferently 
to most People, yet because 
there is variety of such Medicins, 
in respect both of the Matter 
and Form of them, therefore 
some choice may be had in the 
administration of them, that so 
we may comply with the Patient's 
taking them best in this 
or that kind of Form; and also 
[^p.32^] 
that those that are hotter be 
given to Persons of a cold Temper, 
and those Medicines which 
are more temperate to such whose 
Constitutions are hot: I shall 
set down several Forms of Sweating 
Medicines, which are given 
either in Potion, Bolus, or 
Pouder. 
 
[}Potions.}] 
 
Take of Small Plague 
Water, Two Ounces; 
Pestilential Vinegar, 
half an Ounce; of Venice 
Treacle, one 
Dram; mingle them. 
 
[^p.33^] 
Take of Compound Scordium 
Water two Ounces; 
Treacle-Water half an 
Ounce, Venice Treacle 
one Dram, Salt of 
Wormwood one Scruple, 
Spirit of Vitriol 
Six Drops: Mingle 
them. 
 
Take of Butter Burr-Water 
three Ounces; 
Venice Treacle, Diascordium, 
of each one 
Dram, Pestilential Vinegar 
one Spoonful: Mix 
them. 
 
[^p.34^] 
Take of Carduus Water 
Four Ounces, Pestilential 
Vinegar One Ounce, 
Pestilential Extract One 
Scruple: Mix them. 
 
Or make some Posset-Drink 
with Pestilential 
Vinegar; in a Draught 
of it dissolve one Dram, 
or a Dram and a half, of 
any of these Confections, 
adding one Scruple of 
Salt of Wormwood. 
 
In a Spoonful or two of 
[^p.35^] 
Treacle-Water, or 
Vinegar, or both mix'd; 
give fifteen or twenty 
Drops of Spirit of 
Harts-horn, or of the 
simple Mixture from half 
a Dram to a Dram; 
or of Balsam of Sulphur, 
from ten to twenty 
Drops, or fifteen Drops 
of Elixir Proprietatis. 
 
For the Poorer sort, make 
Posset-Drink with Pestilential Vinegar, 
and boyl in it some Butter-Roots, 
and give a Draught hot. 
 
Or make this Potion which 
Henricus a Bra magnifies above 
all other Remedies, from 
[^p.36^] 
the Experience of it in a great 
Plague once raging in his Country. 
 
Take Celandine and 
Rue, of each one handful, 
Marigold Flowers 
half a handful; boyl these 
in a Quart of White-Wine 
Vinegar; strain 
it out, and keep it in a 
Glass Bottle; give two 
or three Spoonfuls; in 
which dissolve of Venice 
Treacle, or Mithridate, 
one Dram. This 
will provoke Sweat 
very powerfully. 
 
[^p.37^] 
Some others commend a Decoction 
of Guaiacum, to provoke 
Sweat with it, as in the cure of 
the French Pox. 
 
A plain Decoction of Rue in 
White Wine, with a little Vinegar 
added to it, is highly commended 
by others. 
 
Seeds of Rue pouder'd, and 
one Dram of it mix'd with half 
a Dram of Treacle, dissolv'd 
with White-Wine, is accounted an 
excellent Sudorifick. 
 
Sudorifick Medicines may be 
given in Pouder thus. 
 
Take of Virginian Snake-weed, 
Contrayerva, 
[^p.38^] 
and Gascoigne Pouder, 
or Lady Kent's Pouder, 
of each one Scruple; give 
it in two Spoonfuls of 
Posset Drink, or of a 
Cordial Julep, or in Syrup 
of Gilloflowers. 
 
Take Pouder of prepar'd 
Toad one Dram, Pouder 
of Hyacinth half a 
Dram: Mingle them. 
 
Take of Bezoartica Mineralis 
half an Ounce, 
of Species Liberans 
two Scruples, Camphire 
[^p.39^] 
eight Grains: Mingle 
them. 
 
Take of the Flower of 
Sal Armoniac half a 
Scruple, of Cerusse of 
Antimony one Scruple, 
of Bole Armenick 
one Scruple: Mingle 
them. 
 
Give any of these in a Spoonful 
or two of any Liquor, or 
in a Spoonful of Sack, with as 
much Pestilential Vinegar; half 
an hour after, drink a draught 
of Posset-Drink with Medesweet, 
or Woodsorrel boyl'd in it. 
 
[^p.40^] 
Take of the Pouder of Ivy 
Berries one Dram; give 
it in a draught of warm 
White-Wine, with a 
Spoonful of Pestilential 
Vinegar. 
 
Take Pouder of the 
Roots of Carline 
Thistle; Give it in the 
same manner. 
 
Likewise Pouder of Butter 
Burr Root, given in 
the same manner, provoketh 
Sweat powerfully, and 
[^p.41^] 
expelleth the Poyson of the 
Plague. 
 
Take of Zedoary Root 
that is gummy and 
sound, one Ounce, Sugar 
Candy one Ounce and 
an half, Camphire half 
an Ounce; mix all in a 
fine Pouder: The Dose 
is one Dram in some 
distill'd Water. 
 
If the Patient can best take 
his Medicine in a Bolus. 
 
Take of Venice Treacle 
one Dram, Tormentile 
Roots, Bole prepar'd, 
[^p.42^] 
of each one Scruple, Syrup 
of Gilloflowers 
as much as sufficeth. 
 
Take Diascordium, Confectio 
Liberans, of 
each half a Dram, or 
two Scruples, Salt of 
Wormwood one Scruple, 
Conserve of Roses 
vitriolated half a Dram, 
Syrup of Gilloflowers 
as much as is 
sufficient. 
 
Take of Conserve of 
Roses half a Dram, 
Balsam of Sulphur, 
[^p.43^] 
fifteen Drops; mix them. 
Take Posset Drink 
half an hour, or an 
hour after any of 
these. 
 
When many People are sick, 
and there is not leisure to compound 
every Dose of these Medicines 
severally, there should be 
a large mixture of each kind made 
up together, which may immediately, 
and without trouble be 
distributed into Doses. 
 
[}For Sweating Potions thus.}] 
 
Take a Quart of Small 
Plague Water, of Compound 
Water of Scordium 
[^p.44^] 
and Pestilential 
Vinegar, of each 
a Quarter of a Pint, 
of Syrup of Gilloflowers 
two Ounces, 
Venice Treacle one 
Ounce, of Diascordium 
and Confectio 
Liberans, of each half 
and Ounce, Pestilential 
Extract, Salt of 
Wormwood, of each 
two Drams; put all together 
in a large Glass, 
shake them well together, 
and after it has stood 
Four and Twenty Hours, 
[^p.45^] 
make use of it: Pour out 
three Ounces of the clear, 
and two Ounces of it 
turbid or shaken just 
before: This may serve 
for fourteen or sixteen 
days. 
 
[}Mix a Pouder thus.}] 
 
Take of the Pouder of Confectio 
Liberans, one 
Ounce, Roots of Contrayerva, 
Virginian-Snakeweed, 
Tormentile, 
Bole prepar'd, 
of each two Drams,

pouder'd, half an Ounce, mix 
all very well. The Dose 
is from one Dram to 
one Dram and a half, 
or two Drams. 
 
Or take of the Pouders of 
Prepar'd Toad one Ounce, 
and of Confectio Liberans 
half an Ounce, mix 
them. The Dose is 
from one Dram to 
one Dram and a half. 
 
For an Electuary to be distributed 
into several Doses, that of 
Hermannus Uander Heyden is 
a very good one, and as he asserts, 
[^p.47^] 
approved by frequent Experience. 
 
Take of Diascordium one 
Ounce and a half, of 
Venice Treacle two 
Drams, of Confectio 
Hyacinthi one Dram, 
Pouder of Nutmegs, 
Rue Seeds, Root of 
Angelica, Enulacampane, 
of each one Dram 
and a half, Wine Vinegar 
(or rather Pestilential 
Vinegar) one 
Ounce, Oyl of Sulphur 
fifteen drops, Syrup of 
Juice of Citron as 
[^p.48^] 
much as sufficeth: make up 
all together. The Dose 
is from one Dram and 
a half to two Drams. 
 
Or take of Conserve of 
Wood Sorrel, half a 
Pound, of Mithridate 
four Ounces. The Dose 
is two Drams. 
 
In time of Sweating, give the 
Patient Posset Drink made with 
Pestilential Vinegar; boyl in the 
Milk Scordium or Marigold Flowers; 
if he is very dry, boyl Medesweet, 
or Wood Sorrel; if he is ill at Stomach, 
and apt to vomit or faint, 
give Claret Wine burnt with Cinnamon 
[^p.49^] 
and Zedoary Root, and Mint 
Water mix'd with it: Or else 
give him Beer boyl'd with a 
Crust of Bread and Mace, and 
sweetn'd with Sugar. Besides, to 
the richer sort give now and then 
a draught of a Cordial Julep, and 
sometimes a Dose of a Cordial Electuary; 
which kind of Medicines 
should be given likewise after 
Sweating is over, once in three 
or four hours, of one or other, 
to refresh the Spirits, and to keep 
the Malignity from the Heart. 
Give him no cold Beer in two 
or three days. After Sweating 
wash the Mouth with White-wine 
Vinegar and Rose Water: Also dip 
a Spunge in the same warm, and 
gently stroke the Temples of the 
Head, and Nostrils with the same 
[^p.50^] 
Between whiles give of the Medicines 
following. 
 
Take Woodsorrel Water, 
and Dragon-Water, 
of each Four Ounces; 
Scordium Water, two 
Ounces; Treacle Water 
(or Plague Water) 
one Ounce and a 
half; Syrup of Gilloflowers 
(or of Juice 
of Citrons) two Ounces; 
Pearle finely pouder'd 
one Scruple; Spirit 
of Vitriol twelve 
Drops: Mix them. 
 
[^p.51^] 
[}Or make a Decoction thus.}] 
 
Take of Harts-Horn 
rasp'd, and Ivory, of each 
three Drams; a Pear 
main sliced, Wood-sorrel 
half an handful: 
Boyl these in three Pints 
of Water, till a third 
part is wasted; Strain 
it on two Ounces of Conserve 
of Gilloflowers, 
or Woodsorrel, or 
Red Roses: Let it 
infuse an hour: then stir it, 
and strain it out: Give a 
Quarter of a Pint warm. 
 
Whereas we give Emulsions 
[^p.52^] 
made with such a Decoction and 
Almonds, and cold Seeds in Fevers, 
Diemerbroek affirms, upon his 
frequent Observation, Emulsions 
never do well in the Plague. 
 
Take of the Conserve 
of Woodsorrel four 
ounces, of the Rob of 
Goosberries or Rasberries 
two Ounces, 
Species Diarrhodon 
Abbatis two Drams, 
Confectionis Liberantis 
one Dram and a 
half, of Prepar'd Pearl 
half a Dram, Red Coral 
prepar'd one Dram, 
with a sufficient quantity 
[^p.53^] 
of Syrup of Juice of 
Citron: Let it be 
made an Opiate: 
The Dose is one 
or two Drams often 
in a day. 
 
Sometimes the Plague is accompanied 
with dangerous Symptoms, 
to which if Remedies are not suddenly 
applied, all we do besides 
is to little purpose. Such Accidents, 
which call for respective 
ways of Cure, are chiefly Fluxes 
of Blood, and Loosness of the Belly, 
and Vomiting. 
 
The first use to happen several 
ways, viz. at the Nose and 
Mouth, by Stool or Urine, by 
the Hæmorrhoids, and in Women 
by Menstrual Purgations: Some 
[^p.54^] 
of which, as by Urine always, 
and oft times by Stool, are mortal; 
none of them ever tend to 
good Therefore in all such cases, 
Remedies must be administred 
which may stop Bleeding: And 
though Sweating and Refection of 
the Spirits be still the principal 
intention of Cure; yet the other 
must come in as collateral with 
both of them; and Medicines 
that restrain Fluxes of Blood be 
mixed both with Sudorificks and 
other Cordials, and also be administred 
with Diet too. 
 
In all Hæmorrhages Sudorificks 
must be compounded of Medicines 
that are temperate, and not 
astringent. 
 
[^p.55^] 
[}For Potions they be made thus}] 
 
Take Pimpernel Water, 
or Tormentil Water 
two Ounces, of Scordium 
Water six Drams, 
of Vinegar that has 
Tormentil Roots infus'd 
in it, two Drams, 
Confection of Hyacinth 
one Dram, of prepar'd 
Bole half a Dram, 
Extract of Tormentil 
one Scruple, of Syrup 
of Coral three 
Drams. 
 
[^p.56^] 
Or make Posset Drink 
with Tormentil Vinegar, 
boyl in it a Root 
of Tormentil and 
Bistort; in one draught 
of it dissolve of Venice 
Treacle two Scruples, 
Confection of Hyacinth, 
prepar'd Bole, 
of each one Scruple. 
 
Make this Apozeme, and give 
two or three Ounces three or four 
times in a day. 
 
Take of Tormentil Roots 
half an Ounce, Bistort 
three Drams, Red Sanders 
[^p.57^] 
one Dram, of 
Pomegranate Peel one 
Dram, St. Johns Wort, 
Plantane and Burnet, 
of each half a handful; 
Flowers of Roses, 
and Pomegranates, 
of each one Dram and a 
half; of Plantane Seeds 
one Dram: Boyl these in 
three Pints of Water till 
a Pint is wasted; strain 
it, and add to it of Syrup 
of Coral two 
Ounces, Confection of 
Hyacinth two Drams: 
Mingle them. 
 
[^p.58^] 
[}Pouders may be compounded 
thus.}] 
 
Take of Confectio Liberans, 
or Confection 
of Hyacinth half 
a Dram; Tormentil 
Roots, Fine Bole, of 
each one Scruple; Pearl 
and Coral prepar'd, 
of each half a Scruple: 
Give it in a Spoonful 
of Syrup of Coral, with 
a Spoonful of Tormentil 
Vinegar. 
 
[^p.59^] 
[}Make a Bolus thus.}] 
 
Take Confection of 
Hyacinth and Venice 
Treacle, of each 
half a Dram; Tormentil 
Roots and prepar'd 
Bole, of each one 
Scruple; of Extract of 
Tormentil half a Scruple, 
of prepar'd Pearl 
six Grains, of Syrup 
of Coral as much as is 
sufficient. 
 
For Juleps and Confections, 
to give in, and betwixt 
[^p.60^] 
Sweating, they be compounded 
thus. 
 
Take of Medesweet Water 
eight Ounces, small 
Plague Water, Scordium 
Compound Water, 
of each three Ounces; 
of Syrup of Coral 
two Ounces, Confection 
of Hyacinth two 
Drams, of Tormentil 
Vinegar half an Ounce; 
Mix them: Give four 
or five Spoonfuls every 
third hour. 
 
Or take of Conserve of 
[^p.61^] 
Red Roses four Ounces, 
of prepar'd Coral two 
Drams, of prepar'd 
Pearl half a Dram, 
Confection of Hyacinth 
and Alkermes, 
of each one Dram, of 
Tormentil Vinegar 
half an Ounce; or as much 
as is sufficient: Make it 
up into an Electuary: 
Give once in three 
or four hours as 
much as a Nutmeg. 
 
These kinds of Remedies, which 
are proper in Hæmorrhages, are 
also to be used in Fluxes of the 
Belly; likewise by Women with 
[^p.62^] 
Child, because other more hot 
Medicines may provoke an Abortion. 
 
[}Make Tormentil Uinegar thus.}] 
 
Take Roots of Tormentil, 
Bistort dried 
and sliced, of each an 
Ounce, Cinnamon half 
an Ounce, Red Sanders 
one Dram: Bruise all 
very well, and put to it a 
Quart of White-Wine 
Vinegar; digest it in 
a common Furnace for 
four days: At the same 
time take Red and 
White Coral finely 
[^p.63^] 
pouder'd, of each half 
an Ounce; Dragons 
Blood, Blood-Stone, 
of each one Dram; Fine 
Bole, two Drams: Digest 
these in the same 
manner with a Quart of 
Vinegar: Then strain 
out both the Liquors, 
and mix them. 
 
[}Let Extract of Tormentil 
Roots be made thus.}] 
 
Take Tormentil and Bistort-Roots, 
of each one 
Ounce; of Cinnamon 
half an Ounce, of Red 
[^p.64^] 
Sanders two Drams, 
Salt of Wormwood 
half an Ounce; bruise 
all together, adding of 
Tormentil Vinegar 
two Ounces; put it in 
a Vessel to digest with 
three Pints of Medesweet 
Water: Strain 
it, and evaporate it with 
a gentle heat in Balneo 
Mariæ to the Consistency 
of Honey. 
 
In the Cure of the Plague, if 
a course of Sweating, timely administred, 
do plentifully succeed, 
and withal other private Excretions 
be either prevented or presently 
[^p.65^] 
supprest, the Patient may 
be judg'd to be in a hopeful 
condition; and sometimes the 
Venom is quite expell'd, without 
any other accident: But for the 
most part, because the Poyson, 
by fermenting the Blood and 
Humours, is soon greatly encreas'd; 
so that all of it, especially 
the grosser Particles, cannot 
easily evaporate, it settles 
in the outward Parts, and there 
causeth the swelling and breaking 
out of divers kinds: Those 
that require any application of 
Remedies, are Boils and Carbuncles. 
 
The first of these commonly 
happen in Parts that are very 
Glandulous; as behind the Ears, 
under the Armpits, and in the 
[^p.66^] 
Groin: They arise with a hard 
Swelling, which ought to suppurate 
and break, and the Corruption 
to be drawn all out, by 
the running of the Sore for some 
time: These Tumors call'd 
Bubo's, should be ordered thus. 
 
If a Blister is not rais'd on, 
or near the place already, 'tis 
good to apply a Vesicatory Plaister 
just below it, but on the 
Tumor it self to apply some 
drawing Medicine, to attract the 
Venom outward; as at first, the 
Fundament of some living Fowl, 
or else a Colewort-Leaf dipt in 
scalding Water, and dried again, 
and smear'd over with Oyl of 
Lillies or Scorpions. To ripen 
the Sore, lay on Pultises or Plaisters; 
or rather first Pultises, and 
[^p.67^] 
then Plaisters, when it tends to 
suppuration; which should be renew'd 
every twelve hours at least. 
 
[}For Pultises.}] 
 
Take an Onion and 
White Lilly Roots, 
boyl them, or else wrap 
them in a wet Paper, 
and roast them in the 
Embers, afterward stamp 
both together, adding a 
little Treacle, and Oyl 
of Lillies as much as 
is sufficient: Or else roast 
a Fig with either or 
both these above-nam'd, 
[^p.68^] 
and make a Pultis in the 
same manner: Or else 
with either, or all above-named 
Remedies, add 
an handful of Scabious 
or Sorrel wash'd; and 
after beat all into a 
Pultis. 
 
Take Pimpernel roasted 
on the Embers, 
mollifie it with Oyl 
of Scorpions, adding 
a little Pouder of 
Myrrh and Venice 
Treacle, and lay it to 
the Sore. 
 
[^p.69^] 
Some do commend live 
Frogs to be applyed, 
and renew'd as oft as they 
die. 
 
For a Plaister to break the 
Sore when it is open'd, 
Diachylon with 
Gums; or else those two 
Emplaisters, viz. Emplastrum 
Paracelsi, 
and de Fuligine, mention'd 
by Diemerbroek, 
pag. 213. Paracelsus his 
Plaister is there thus 
order'd to be made. 
 
[^p.70^] 
Take of Gum Oppopanax 
two Ounces, Seraphin 
or Sagapen four 
Ounces, Bdellium three 
Ounces, Galbanum 
one Ounce, Olibanum 
two Drams; let them be 
dissolved in Vinegar, 
and strain'd, and adding 
the Pouder of a 
dried Toad and 
Frog, of Natural 
Brimstone one Ounce, 
of Camphire one 
Dram: Let it be 
made a Plaister to 
[^p.71^] 
be put upon the 
Tumor, and renewed 
every six hours. 
 
[}Emplastrum de Fuligine, 
or Plaister of Soot, is thus 
made.}] 
 
Take of Chimney Soot 
ten Drams, Leaven, 
Turpentine, Butter, 
of each one Ounce, Venice 
Sope one Ounce 
and a half, of Honey 
of Roses six Drams, 
Common Salt half 
an Ounce, the Whites 
of two Eggs, Treacle 
[^p.72^] 
and Mithridate, 
of each two Drams: 
Let them be mixed. 
For the Poorer sort, 
Shoemakers Wax is 
as good as any. 
 
If when the Tumor is ripen'd, 
it do not soon break of it self, 
it is best to open it by Incision; 
and when it is broken, put in a 
Pledget dipp'd in Turpentine 
mix'd with the Yolk of an Egg; 
or dress it with Basilicon alone, 
or the Liniment or Arceus. 
 
A Carbuncle, which is the 
other kind of Plague-Sore, which 
requires the operation of the 
hand, happens but seldom in 
any of the Emunctories [and 
[^p.73^] 
when it does it portends ill] but 
useth to be in most places else: 
It ariseth with angry Pustules, 
sometimes one, sometimes many; 
which soon grow discolour'd, 
and tend to Mortification, and 
the substance mortified must 
be cast out, and then the hollow 
Ulcer which remains must be 
healed. 
 
When a Carbuncle first appears, 
Diemerbroek commends to be 
applied to it for the first and second 
day, a Red Colewort Leaf, 
smear'd over with Rape Oyl: The 
same Author mentions a Pultis 
which he us'd for the most part, 
renewing it three or four times 
in four and twenty hours, till the 
Core was taken out; and then 
Digestive Medicines, and others 
[^p.74^] 
succeedingly are to be us'd, as in 
other Ulcers. 
 
Take Scabious and Devils 
Bit, of each two 
or three handfuls, stamp 
them, and then beat them 
with the Yolks of 
two Eggs, and a little 
Salt; lay it to the 
Carbuncle warm, renewing 
it three times in 
a day at least.
