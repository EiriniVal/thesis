[^f.A4r^] 
[}A Treatise of the 
Pestilence.}] 
 
[}The first Chapter sheweth the first 
cause of the disease.}] 
 
IN treating of the disease 
called the Plague or 
Pestilence, I minde not 
to be ouer long, or curious, 
as they that write 
exquisitely and perfectly 
of the matter: onely I will set downe a 
few thinges, necessary, and sufficient for 
the commoditie, & profite of them, which 
in this cause shall haue neede of helpe. 
 
First therfore I wyl shew the causes 
of the disease: & secondly preseruatiues 
whereby a man may be kepte from the 
sicknesse: thirdly, the tokens, whereby 
he that is diseased maye gather, and vnderstande, 
whether he be infected wyth 
the plague or no: fourthly, and last of al, 
I wyll sette downe some remedies and 
medicines to cure the diseases. Some 
Physitians recite foure principal causes 
of the Pestilence. The first pertayneth 
[^f.A4v^] 
to Diuinitie, the seconde to Astronomie, 
the third and fourth to Physick. As touching 
that which pertaynes to diuinitie, 
our sinne and wickednesse, (the principal 
cause of al our miserie and calamitie,) is 
one cause of this disease. As may apeare 
by the words of Moses vnto the Israelites: 
who among manye other curses, 
and punishments for sinne, reciteth the 
[/1./] 
Pestilence as one, saying: If thou wilte 
not obey the voice of the Lord thy God, 
to keepe and to doe all his commaundementes 
and his ordinaunces, whiche I 
commaunde thee this day: then all these 
curses shal come vppon thee, & ouertake 
thee. Cursed shalt thou be in the towne, 
& cursed in the fielde, &c. The Lord shall 
make the Pestile~ce cleaue vnto thee, vntill 
he haue consumed thee, from the land 
[/2./] 
which thou goest to possesse. Moreouer, 
[/3./] 
we reade that seuentie thousande of the 
Israelites died of this disease, for the 
sinne of Dauid their King. I thinke no 
man wil deny, but y=t= hereby it is euident 
that sinne is a cause of the Pestilence euen 
among vs. For whatsoeuer thyngs 
[^f.A5r^] 
are written afore time, are written for 
our learning: and the punishment of the 
Israelites, is an example to vs, that we 
[/4./] 
should auoyd sinne, lest their plagues fal 
vpon vs. For their God is our God, and 
he hateth sinne in vs, as he did in them, 
and there fore punisheth it in vs, as hee 
did in them. Therefore I saye sinne is a 
principal cause of the Pestilence: wherby 
God punisheth not so muche those, 
whom he taketh therby out of this life: 
as those that remaine aliue. For they 
that liue, feele the smarte of the plague, 
when as the other, manye of them, dye 
Gods seruants, and for this transitorie 
life, enioy that, which neuer shal end. If 
oure owne experience doe not teache vs 
this, we may perceiue it by the foresayd 
punishment of King Dauid, to whom it 
had not beene so greeuous to haue dyed 
himselfe, as to leese his subiectes, in the 
multitude whereof, he through a worldly 
wisdome trusted more than in the almightye 
power of God. Therefore God 
diminished the number of them by the 
Pestilence: to teache him, and all other 
[^f.A5v^] 
Princes, not to put their trust in y=e= multitude 
of menne, (bicause it is his owne 
worke to preserue the state of Realmes, 
& to giue victorye in battell:) and also to 
teache vs, and all men, that sinne is a 
cause of the plague, aswel as of other ca 
lamities y=t= happen vnto men. Although 
this cause be supernaturall, (as some 
tearme it,) and not properly pertayning 
to Phisicke: yet those Phisitions are not 
to be misliked, which in reciting y=e= causes 
of this sicknesse, note this in the first 
place, as the roote of the residue, vppon 
the whiche the other do depend, & consequently 
doe followe: the whiche beeing 
expelled, the other shall not bee perceyued 
to our hurte, but shall vanishe euen 
as the smoke, when the fire is taken away. 
Therfore these Phisitions are like 
vnto good & faithfull Chirurgians, whiche 
seeke the bottome of the wound, and 
heale it throughly. But they that prescribe 
preseruatiues onely againste the 
third and fourth cause of the plague, are 
like vnto vnskilfull Chirurgians that 
heale the wounde withoute, and leaue 
[^f.A6r^] 
corruption in the fleshe, whiche shortely 
after breaketh out to further inco~uenience. 
For they that are preserued from 
the Pestile~ce, or are healed of it, may be 
sure, if the corruption of sinne remaine 
within them, that a greater plague wil 
folow. For God sendeth this, and diuers 
other calamities, for the punishment of 
sinne: as oure sauiour signifieth, saying 
to the man that he hadde healed: Behold, 
thou art made whole, sin no more, 
[/5./] 
leaste a worse thing happen vnto thee. 
Howbeit, I graunt that we may learne 
by the word of God, that he se~deth sicknesse, 
trouble, and miserie often tymes 
to good men, not for sinne onely, but for 
diuers other causes: yet this, that I 
haue saide, remaineth moste true, that 
Sinne is one, and the principall cause 
of the Pestilence. 
 
[}The second Chapter sheweth the second 
cause of the Pestilence.}] 
 
THe second cause is giuen by Astronomers, 
and is called an euill constellation: 
[^f.A6v^] 
which they know by the placing 
of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, 
in the firmament, or circles of Heauen, 
and by their coniunctions, oppositions, 
& other aspectes of the one to the other. 
Of this cause I do not thinke it needfull 
here to speake, especially in such maner 
as the Astronomers doe, who by their 
Ethnicall phrases, and kindes of speach 
in their Alminackes and Prognostications, 
do seeme to fauor or foster the Idolatrie 
of the Heathen: who worshipped 
those celestiall creatures as Gods. 
For they speake of them, either as of 
Gods, or (at the least) as of liuing Princes, 
indued with reason, and beeyng in 
great power, and authoritie. Moreouer, 
wheras they write their Prognostications 
to the vse of the vnlearned, I know 
not to what purpose they set downe the 
motions of the planets, with their termes 
of Arte, only known to themselues. 
If the Art be profitable for Phisicke, let 
them keep it to themselues, and vse it in 
their practises: if it bee profitable for 
husbandrie, let them write that onelye 
[^f.A7r^] 
whiche is according to the capacitie of 
husbandmen: Whiche being done, I 
thinke husbandmen shall haue little vse 
of their writings. 
 
For although husbandrie did (perhaps) 
first proceede of the knowledge of Astronomy, 
as diuerse other trades necessary 
for the life of man, haue their beginning 
of Geometry, and natural Philosophy, 
yet I think husbandmen, and men of other 
faculties, whiche are altogither ignorant 
in these Artes, are more skilfull 
and wise, through their daily practise, in 
the vse therof, than they themselues that 
are professors of the Artes. Thus much 
by the way, by occasion of the seconde 
cause of the Pestilence. 
 
[}The third Chapter sheweth the third 
cause of the Pestilence.}] 
 
THe thirde cause, (whiche more properly 
belongeth to Phisicke,(is the 
corruption of the ayre: whiche beyng 
corrupted, is apte to infect mans body. 
For euery man that liueth, draweth the 
[^f.A7v^] 
breath which we haue, of the aire round 
about vs. If it be stinking, venomous, 
and corrupt, the body of man y=t= is neare 
to it, is in danger of corruption, wherof 
oft times is ingendered the Pestilence. 
The aire is corrupt, either generally in 
diuers Cities, or Countries: or particularly, 
in some one place. 
 
Generally (as Astronomers write) by 
an euil constellation, or by y=e= filthy matter 
of a Comete, caused by y=e= constellation: 
Particularly, in a fewe houses, or 
streetes, through the stincke of chanels, 
of filthie dung, of carion, of standing 
pudles, and stincking waters, of seeges, 
or stinking priuies: of sheding of mans 
bloude, and of deade bodies, not deeply 
buried, (which happeneth among Souldiors:) 
of common pissing places, and 
such like. Finally a gret company dwelling 
or lying in a smal roome, (especially 
if those roomes be not very clenly kept, 
& perfumed,) do inge~der a corrupt aire, 
apt to infect those that are in it: whiche 
infected perso~s and their infectious clothes, 
may infect a whole Citie, and the 
[^f.A8r^] 
Citie may infect the country that resorteth 
vnto it, or vnto the which the inhabitants 
thereof do resorte. For a venomous 
aire is like vnto fire, whiche burneth 
that is nighe vnto it: if the matter 
be apt to take fire. Wherby it commeth 
to passe somtimes, that as a litle sparke 
consumeth a whole Town: so one house 
or streete, infecteth the whole Citie and 
Country rounde about it: the persons 
I meane of the Citie and Country, that 
come within the compasse of the infectious 
aire: if their bodies be apt to be infected. 
I say a venomous aire infecteth 
[/6./] 
not all, but those only, whose bodies are 
apte to be infected. For if the ayre were 
of power to infect all that come wythin 
the compasse of it, then in a generall 
corruption of y=e= aire, none should escape 
infection, whiche commeth not to passe. 
For, as fire burneth, but not Iron and 
stone, as it dothe strawe, cole, and wood: 
so a corrupte aire hath power to infect, 
but those bodies onelye, that are apte to 
receiue the venomous operation thereof. 
Therefore, vnlesse vnto this thirde 
[^f.A8v^] 
cause of the Pestile~ce, the fourth be added, 
it is of no force. 
 
[}The fourth Chapter sheweth the 
fourth cause of the Pestilence.}] 
 
THE fourth cause is the aptnesse of 
mans body, through euill humors 
to receiue y=e= effecte of a venomous aire, 
putrifying and corrupting the bodie: 
whereof the disease is ingendered. The 
bodie is made apte to be infected by the 
abuse of things not naturall, (as Phisitions 
tearme them,) that is to saye, by 
taking of meate and drinke out of measure, 
specially by feeding of many dishes 
at one meale, or by too much lack of good 
nourishing meate, by too much sleepe, or 
watching, by too much laboure or ease: 
Finally, by too muche anger, griefe of 
minde, and feare of the disease. As all 
these things are dangerous: so the laste 
is sufficient of it selfe to infect the body, 
and consequently to bring deathe, as I 
haue heard it declared by dyuerse examples. 
 
[^f.B1r^] 
Hitherto, I haue shewed of what 
things chiefly the Plague doth proceede, 
to the end, that euery man may the better 
escape it, from the whiche there is 
no better preseruatiue, than to auoide 
the causes. 
 
For, as it is an olde saying, so euerye 
man maye easily perceiue it to be true: 
Sublata causa, tollitur effectus, when the 
cause is remoued, the effecte followeth 
not. If the cause of warre bee taken away, 
wee shall haue peace: so if wee auoide 
the cause of sicknesse, wee shall 
haue healthe. If fire bee not laide to the 
woodde, it cannot burne: so, if there bee 
nothing that bringeth or causeth the 
Plague, we cannot be infected. Therefore 
it serueth our tourne very much, to 
know the causes thereof. 
 
For it is a very true saying, Fœlix qui 
potuit rerum cognoscere causas, he is happy 
that can vnderstande the causes of thinges. 
By vnderstanding the causes of 
good thinges, we may the more easilye 
obtaine that which is profitable for vs: 
and by vnderstanding the causes of euill 
[^f.B1v^] 
thynges, wee maye the more easily auoyde 
that whych is hurtefull vnto vs. 
 
Therefore I haue sette downe the 
causes of the Plague. Nowe, it foloweth, 
that I write of the preseruatiues, 
whereby a man may be kept from this 
disease. 
 
[}The fift Chapter, wherein is mentioned 
a preseruatiue against the first 
cause of the Pestilence.}] 
 
IN this part we must haue an eie to 
the causes. For except the preseruatiues 
be of force, and also contrary, or 
(as I may saye) enimies to the causes: 
they cannot preuaile against them. For 
preseruatiues are to the causes of diseases, 
as watchmen are to theeues. If the 
watchmen be strong ynoughe, and also 
haue a minde to resist the theeues, they 
will keepe the house from robbing: but 
if they lack of stre~gth, or if they consent 
vnto the robbers, and let the~ haue their 
purpose: they rather doe harme than 
good to him y=t= appointed them to watch. 
[^f.B2r^] 
So the preseruatiues must be suche, as 
are contrarie to the causes of diseases, 
and able to resist them, or else they can 
not keepe a man from sicknesse. The 
first cause of the plague is Sin. Therefore 
it is requisite if possibly it might be, 
that we did in all points abstaine from 
it. But forasmuch as the corruption of 
our flesh is suche, that we sinne often 
times, and there is no man liuing, that 
without Pharisaicall, Papisticall, and 
Phantasticall arrogancie can say, hee is 
voide of wickednesse: it remaineth, that 
with al speed, before the ripenesse of our 
sinne stir vp Gods wrath againste vs to 
plague vs: it remaineth (I say) that we 
purge, and cleanse oure selues from all 
sinne and wickednesse. Sinnes are eyther 
Publique or Priuate. Publique 
offences, or (to speake more properly,) 
offences that are committed by a multitude 
openly, so that they are manifest 
to the eies of al men, must be purged by 
Publique aucthoritie: and Priuate, or 
secret offences, euery priuate man must 
seeke to purge of hymselfe l. Although 
[^f.B2v^] 
I knowe, that of the twoo, publique 
offences are more daungerous, as the 
which are cause of warre, famine, and 
pestilence, of captiuitie, of the spoyle of 
mens goods, of destruction of the people, 
and of the subuersion of kingdomes. 
Yet, forasmuche as it perteineth not to 
my purpose, in this treatise, to speake of 
these offences, I let them passe. For as 
in many things perteining to Phisicke, 
I referre the richer sorte to the counsell 
of the lerned Phisitions: so in this matter, 
I referre them that are in authoritie, 
to the sermons, and writings of the 
lerned diuines. But as it doth little good 
to cut off the toppes of weedes in a garden, 
and not to dig vp the roote, bycause 
most commonly they wil come vp thicker 
than they did before: so it is almoste 
a laboure in vaine, to shew means how 
to purge the wickednes of priuate me~, 
vnlesse publique offences bee firste cured. 
For as from the root commeth nourishment 
to herbs both good and badde, 
whereby they grow and flourishe: so by 
publique offences, the wickednesse of 
[^f.B.3r^] 
priuate men is encreased, & maintained, 
or (at the least)so hid and couered, that 
it cannot be perceyued. These offences, 
whiche I call publique, doe annoye the 
whole bodie, not without some griefe of 
the principall members of the common 
weale: which being vncured, I persuade 
my selfe, that the operation of my poore 
medicines, prescribed vnto the inferior 
partes, wil be very small. Therefore, I 
wishe all them that are in authoritie, to 
aske counsell of God, who speaketh vnto 
vs in his word. If they be not students 
of Diuinitie, and therfore mistrust their 
own iudgement, let them resort to Sermons, 
and to the writings of the learned 
Diuines. Let the~ ask of them whether 
these dayly customes of running to 
playes, and enterludes, and to bearebaitings, 
aswell vppon the Sabboth daye, 
ordeined for the seruice of God, as vpon 
other daies, appointed for me~ to worke: 
whether daily haunting of Tauerns, & 
Alehouses, both early in the morning, & 
in the after noone, whereof proceedeth 
drunkennes, the cause of much mischeef: 
[^f.B3v^] 
whether common dicing, and other idle 
and hurtful pastimes: whither resorting 
to harlots company: do displease God, 
and prouoke hym to plague vs, or no? 
 
Let them aske of them, whether that 
playes vpon the Sundayes be godly exercises, 
fitte for the sanctification of the 
Saboth day or no: vnto the which, light 
persons for the most part resorte: where 
(throughe lighte communication of one 
with another,) occasion is ministred of 
further inconuenience: which is not so 
secrete, nor so small, but that honest me~ 
do both perceiue it, and speake of it. Finally, 
let the Magistrats ask of the godly 
Preachers, whether they that resorte 
daily to Bearebaitings, are not aswell 
worthie to be whipped oute of a Common 
weale, as those vagarant persons, 
whiche wil not worke, & yet seeke 
to liue vpon other mens labours. For if 
search were made, it wold be fou~d, that 
no small nu~ber of them that haunte the 
Beare gardens, are not of anye greate 
wealth, and yet they spend their money, 
and leese their time, whiche shoulde rather 
[^f.B4r^] 
bee bestowed in labouring for the 
maintenaunce of themselues, and theyr 
familie. But (as I saide) referring them 
that are in authoritie, to the counsell of 
the learned Diuines, for the redresse of 
these and suche like matters, I let them 
passe, and wil speake of priuate wickednesse. 
 
[}The sixte Chapter sheweth briefly, 
how priuate wickednes may 
be purged.}] 
 
HAd I not said, that I mind not to be 
ouer long or curious, some woulde 
looke here, that I shoulde set downe all 
kinde of priuate or secrete offences. For 
in Phisicke, they that are learned in the 
Art, do first shew the disease, what it is, 
and after the preseruatiues, and medicines 
for the same. The like order in other 
Artes is commendable. But if I 
followe it, I shall make a large volume 
contrarie to my promise. Therefore, as 
in other places, I omitte many things: 
so in this, I will referre the godly Reader 
to the writings of the Euangelists, 
[^f.B4v^] 
Prophets, and Apostles, and to the sermons 
of learned men, and will onely set 
[/7./] 
down that whiche is written in Ecclesiasticus, 
in the whiche booke Iesus the 
sonne of Sirach hath these wordes: My 
sonne, faile not in thy sickenesse, but 
pray vnto the Lorde, and hee will make 
thee whole: Leaue off from sinne, and order 
thine hands aright, and clense thy 
hearte from all wickednesse. 
 
Here the wise man teacheth vs twoo 
thynges, whiche are medicines in time 
of the Pestilence, & preseruatiues before 
it commeth, that is to saye, Prayer, and 
Repentaunce. Repentaunce, (whiche 
chiefly co~sisteth in forsaking of wickednesse 
and amendment of life,) must goe 
before: then our Prayer that followeth, 
shall be acceptable vnto GOD. 
 
[/8./] 
For hys eies are vppon the righteous, 
and his eares are open vnto their 
prayers: but sinners he wil not heare. 
Althoughe all menne are sinners, yet 
when we repent, GOD putteth away 
oure synne, and we are accompted as 
righteous in his sight. In this case, if 
[^f.B5r^] 
wee praye vnto him, he will graunt vs 
those things that are conuenient for vs. 
What are the partes of Repentaunce, 
howe we ought to praye, and other circumstances 
belonging to these things, 
the ignorant reader hath to learne, as is 
aforesayde. 
 
This may be sufficient in this shorte 
treatise, for the preseruatiues againste 
the first cause of the Pestilence. 
 
[}The seuenth Chapter sheweth the preseruatiues 
against the second cause 
of the Pestilence.}] 
 
THe second is linked to the first, and 
last causes, as the effect of the one, 
and cause of the other. For the euyll 
constellation causeth an infectious aire, 
and an aptnesse of mannes bodie to receiue 
the effect thereof, whiche constellation 
is not so muche euill of it selfe, 
as per Accidens, bycause wee are sinners. 
But if the Astronomers dare 
saye, that the Starres, or the motion 
of them, (created of GOD from the 
[^f.B5v^] 
beginning,) whiche maketh the constellation, 
is euill of it selfe, (the trueth 
therof I referre to the Diuines to dyscusse:) 
yet I dare say, that the operation 
thereof, coulde haue no force to the 
hurte of man, if we were his faithfull 
seruauntes, and did continuallye walke 
in his commaundementes. For vnto 
the children of GOD it is sayd: Feare 
not the signes of Heauen. So little cause 
[/9./] 
haue they to feare the signes of Heauen, 
that for their sakes GOD altereth 
the course of the starres, whych he 
[/10./] 
hymselfe created. For the commoditie of 
the Israelites, he staied the course of the 
Sunne, so that one daye was as long as 
two. For Ezechias sake he brought the 
Sunne tenne degrees back. In that text 
where this is written, if a degree be taken 
as Astronomers take it, and as I do 
take it, for the thirtith part of a signe in 
the firmament, it may be thought, that 
that moneth was ten dayes longer than 
other monthes are. If it were so, it is no 
more wo~derful tha~ other miracles, whiche 
God hath wrought for his children. 
 
[^f.B6r^] 
For where as the Egyptians were 
[/11./] 
plagued with tenne greeuous plagues, 
the Israelites, Gods chosen people, whiche 
dwelled hard by them, were not touched 
therewith. And for theyr sakes 
[/12./] 
he made the bitter waters sweete, and 
gaue them drinke out of a rocke, and 
foode from heauen. For their sakes, he 
[/13./] 
made the waters of the riuer Iordan go 
backe: yea, and the waters of the great 
sea. He made the sea drie ground, so that 
[/14./] 
his people went safely through the middest 
therof. For their sakes he sent hailestones 
[/15./] 
from heauen, and slue their enymies. 
For the three yong mens sakes, 
that woulde not bowe downe to the Image 
that the idolatrous king had commaunded 
to be worshipped, God turned 
the heate of the fire from them, vppon 
their enimies, that put them into the 
hote burnyng ouen. For Daniels sake, 
[/16./] 
who woulde not worshippe the idoll 
Bell, nor the Dragon: God stopped seue~ 
Lions mouthes, into whose den he was 
put: which Lio~s, though they were kept 
without meate seuen dayes, yet they neuer 
[^f.B6v^] 
opened their mouth against Daniel: 
in the meane time, God prouided sustenaunce 
for him. These and many other 
like wonderfull woorkes of Almightie 
God, are written for our learning, that 
we worshipping him aright, might haue 
confidence in him without fear, what so 
euer the signes of the heauens do threaten 
against vs. 
 
For if God, for the commoditye of his 
children, after the course of the starres, & 
of the waters: if for their commoditie, he 
quench the heate of the fire, and stay the 
rage of the fierce and hungrie Lions, 
if he wonderfullye preserue them from 
plagues, and slaye their enimies: wee 
maye be sure, if we forsake our wickednesse, 
and keepe his lawes, the operation 
of the starres shall haue no force to hurt 
vs. Therfore it followeth, that the same 
preseruatiues, which serue against the 
first cause of the Pestilence, that is to say 
Repentance, and Prayer, are very good, 
and auailable against an euill constellation: 
the which beeing well vsed, the other 
that are to be taken againste the 
[^f.B7r^] 
third and fourth causes, will take the 
better effect. 
 
This that I haue sayde, the Astronomers 
will not deny. And if they giue 
anye other preseruatiue againste the seconde 
cause, than this which I haue set 
downe, I thinke it superfluous & vaine: 
as I doe all the publishing of their practises 
Astronomical, ouer & aboue that, 
whiche it teacheth vs, to discerne one 
time of the yeare from another, and to 
direct men from place to place, from sea 
to sea, from land to land, and from countrie 
to countrie. Some reason of my opinion 
I haue alreadye giuen: vnto the 
whiche I adde, that in diuerse points, it 
draweth mens mindes from depending 
vppon Gods prouidence, & moueth them 
to directe their actions by the motions 
of the Starres. Therfore I doe not 
thinke their Arte necessarie, or profytable 
in a Christian common weale, further 
than is aforesayde. I thynke rather, 
that the burning of their bookes 
woulde be as acceptable a sacrifice to 
GOD, as that of the Ephesians: 
[/17./] 
[^f.B7v^] 
whose bookes of curious Artes consumed 
with fire, were valued at fiftye 
thousande peeces of siluer. For theyr 
Arte is vnlawfull, and forbidden by 
GOD his lawe, in these wordes following. 
If a man, or woman, haue a 
spirite of diuination, or southsaying in 
[/18./] 
them, they shall dye the death, they shal 
stone them to death, their bloud shall be 
vpon them. 
 
Let none of them be found amo~g you, 
[/19./] 
that maketh his sonne, or his daughter 
go through the fire, or that vseth witchcrafte, 
or is a regarder of times, or a 
marker of the flying of foules, or a sorcerer, 
or a charmer, or that counselleth 
with spirites, or a southsayer or y=t= asketh 
counsel at the dead. 
 
If they say that no clause, in these sentences, 
maketh against their Arte, (I 
meane diuination, or iudiciall Astronomie,) 
I doubt not, but that the Hebrue 
Grammarians wil easily proue the contrarie, 
by y=e= signification of the Hebrue 
wordes, out of the whiche language, 
these lawes of God are translated. If 
[^f.B8r^] 
this question did pertain to my purpose, 
I would stande longer vppon it: but I 
let it passe, and will returne to my preseruatiues. 
 
[}The eighth Chapter sheweth the 
preseruatiues against the third 
cause of the Pestilence.}] 
 
THe third cause was sayde to be the 
corruption of the ayre. The preseruatiue 
is, to auoyde, as much as may be, 
those things aforesayde, that cause corruption. 
In the which, good heede muste 
be taken of clothes, and also of dogges, & 
rattes, that haunt infected places. Syr 
Thomas Eliot, in his castle of healthe, 
sayth, It hath beene seene, that infected 
stuffe lying in a cofer fast shutte for the 
space of two yeares, and then being opened, 
hath infected those that stood nigh it, 
who soone after died. And he that willeth 
to kill al the dogs, (vnlesse they be tied 
vp,) in time of infection, giueth not the 
worst counsel. Not many yeares since, 
I knew a Glouer in Oxforde, who with 
his familie, to the number of ten or eleuen 
[^f.B8v^] 
persons, died of the Plague: whiche 
was sayde to be brought into the house 
by a dogge skinne that his wife bought, 
when the disease was in the Citie. It is 
good therefore, when it is in anye house, 
well to aire in the Sunne, or at the fire, 
the clothes that the infected persons do 
weare, that they lye in, or that are neere 
vnto them, For the fire is a good purger 
of euill ayres: it is of force to drawe 
the venome thereof vnto it, and to consume 
it. So that if the fire be betweene a 
man, and the infected person, or place, 
it taketh awaye the force of the euyll 
ayre. 
 
Therefore the counsell of Physitians 
is, to make a fire at all times, especially 
in the morning, and euening, in the 
houses, and also without in the streetes, 
where the disease reigneth. It is writte~ 
that y=e= famous Phisitian Hippocrates, 
was a meane to preserue the citie, and 
countrie of Athens, from the daunger of 
the Pestilence, by making greate fiers 
in the streetes, and all aboute the towne 
by night: at whiche time (bicause of the 
[^f.C1r^] 
absence of the Sunne,) the ayre was 
most contagious: whereby the inhabitants 
were deliuered fro~ certain death, 
whych they were persuaded should haue 
come among them. I say not as some ignorantly 
do, nor as the Atheniens (whiche 
knewe not GOD) thoughte: that 
Hippocrates preserued the Cittie: but 
that he was a meane to preserue it, by y=e= 
ordinaunce of God: who as many times 
miraculously, so for the most part, worketh 
by ordinarie meanes: who hath giuen 
to herbes, and other his creatures, 
vertue to expell diseases: and also hathe 
giuen vnto men knowledge and vnderstanding 
thereof: whyche he vseth as 
his instrumentes, wherewith he worketh, 
when, and vppon whome, it pleaseth 
him. 
 
This I write by the way, that when 
the vertues of hearbes, and other Gods 
creatures are mentioned, we depende 
chiefly vpon his prouidence, & alwayes 
with the eyes of our faith looke vppon 
him, as the chiefe worker of al good thinges, 
without whome nothing can take 
[^f.C1v^] 
effect to our commoditie. Wyth thys 
minde we maye be bolde to seeke to the 
Physitian, and to vse suche things as 
God hath created for our health. Co~trariwise, 
if a man refuse them in time of 
necessitie, when the Phisitian is readye 
to minister them after this sort: I take 
him to be a tempter of God, or as one 
accessarie to his owne death. After thys 
sort I counsell al men against the thirde 
cause of the pestilence, to vse the fire, vnto 
the which it is good to adde perfumes 
of Juniper, Incense, & such like: & as the 
time of the yere serueth, green boughes, 
sweete floures, and hearbes, are to be set 
and strewed in the houses, and streetes: 
as well where the disease reigneth not, 
as in places infected. 
 
Finally, it is good to hold in the mouth 
and to bite of the Orenge peele, or of the 
roote of the herbe called Angelica. Here 
note by the way, that where I saye, or 
signifie that persons, or places infected 
must be auoyded: I counsell not any ma~ 
whose vocation requireth, or the necessity 
of the diseased, or charitie bindeth to 
[^f.C2r^] 
be present with the infected: I counsell 
them not (I saye) to absent themselues 
from them: but rather to preferre the 
commaundement of God before theyr 
owne safegarde, vsing suche things as 
GOD hath ordeined for the preseruation 
of mans helth. For in so doing their 
life shall be nothing the shorter. 
 
[}The ninth Chapter speaketh of the 
preseruatiues against the fourth 
cause of the Plague.}] 
 
I Sayd y=e= fourth cause of this disease 
is, the aptnesse of mans body to receiue 
the effect of a corrupt aire: for preseruation 
whereof, those things aforesaid 
must be auoyded, which ingender euyll 
humours, or other wise make the bodie 
vnable to expel euill aire. 
 
The firste of these, is the taking of 
meate, and drinke out of measure, and 
too much lacke of it. Of the former the 
riche are in daunger: by the latter the 
poore are pinched. But the riche can 
finde meanes by purgations to expel the 
[^f.C2v^] 
superfluitie of euill humours: whyche 
in time of necessitie is verye requisite. 
Howbeit it is a co~mon saying, that many 
purgations, and other such euacuations, 
doe weaken the body, diminish the 
naturall moysture that prolongeth life, 
and therfore hasten death. 
 
For auoyding of the which inconuenience, 
I would shew them a better remedie, 
if they coulde learne it: and that 
is this: That they diminishe some parte 
of their excesse, and giue it to their honest 
neyghbours that can not worke: and also 
to them that labour, whose charge is 
such, that they are not able to maintayn 
their familie. 
 
This is more healthfull for themselues, 
better fer a Common weale, and 
more acceptable to GOD. Further 
of this matter I neede not to write: For 
the meaner sorte, that laboure truely in 
that trade, whiche God hath appointed 
them, haue not muche to feare the corruption 
of their bodies: who must eate, 
and drinke: sleepe, and watche: laboure, 
and rest, as they may: and take such medicines 
[^f.C3r^] 
as they are able. I knowe that 
against this cause, and the former, the 
learned Physitians prescribe many preseruatiues, 
curious, and costly: as choice 
of meates, and drinkes, perfumes, sauours, 
things to be eaten, and dronke: 
things to washe the teethe, hands, face, 
and head: letting of bloud, purgations by 
pouders, pilles, and electuaries, and 
such like. They that are able, and wylling 
to take these things, (if they haue 
not a Phisitian at hand,) may vndersta~d 
them by the bookes of these learned me~, 
that haue already written of this matter: 
namely, sir Thomas Eliot, D. Faire, 
and diuerse other. 
 
Therefore commending vnto the reader, 
for this purpose, onelye the hearbe 
Carduus Benedictus (the vertues wherof 
are hereafter sette downe,) I make 
an end of this part of my treatise. 
 
[}The tenth Chapter sheweth the tokens, 
wherby a sicke ma~ may vndersta~d, 
whether he be infected with 
the Plague, or no.}] 
 
[^f.C3v^] 
IN y=e= next part is to be declared, what 
are y=e= tokens, which shew that a ma~ 
is infected with the Plague. Firste, for 
the most part, there appeareth about the 
eare or necke, or vnder the arme-holes, 
or about y=e= flanke of the infected person, 
an Aposthume, or swelling, with a Feuer, 
or Ague: or in some other part of the 
body, a greene, blacke, or euill coloured 
sore. This (I say) appeareth for the most 
part, but not alwayes. Therefore, for the 
more certainty, the other tokens folowing 
must be considered. An other token 
is, a greate pricking and shooting in the 
body, especially in those foresayd places, 
the necke, armeholes, and flankes. The 
third is an outragious heate within the 
bodie, as if a man were in the fire: & yet 
oftentimes y=e= outward parts are so cold, 
that it maketh a man to shake, as if he 
were in a Feuer. This inward heate is 
ioyned with much heauinesse of y=e= head: 
drinesse of the mouth, & extreme thirst. 
Where vpon, in some followeth a maruellous 
desire to sleepe, so that they can 
not be kepte waking: othersome can 
[^f.C4r^] 
not sleepe, but are out of quiet, & raue as 
though they were falne into a Phrensy, 
or are like them that dote. Other signes 
are, hardnesse to drawe the breathe, or 
muche labour to take winde: whiche in 
some is so straight, that they can scarse 
speake. Also the breath stinking: greate 
pain of the head: faintnesse, sluggishnesse, 
weakenesse of the lims: the bodye verye 
heauie, & dul: the sweat stinking: the pulsies 
beating thicke, small, and deepe: anguishe, 
& pensiuenesse of minde: pain in y=e= 
mouth, of y=e= stomack: no apetite to meat: 
often vomitting, the vomit being bitter 
and of diuerse colours: bitternesse, and 
blacknesse, or yellownesse, and drynesse 
of the tongue: the vrine much like vnto 
beastes stale, troubled, thicke, and stinking, 
or at the firste like cleane water, 
then blackishe, and at the last troubled, 
and for the moste parte, without any 
residence: chaunging of sight, so that 
there commeth sometimes to the patientes 
eyes, as it were a yellow coloure, 
and sometimes all that he beholdeth he 
thinketh to be green: paine of the mouth 
[^f.C4v^] 
or an vnaturall taste, bitter, sower, or 
stinking. These are the principal signes 
of infection: and yet not certaine tokens 
of the Plague. For it may be sometimes 
in a man without any of them: and also 
some of these tokens are in manye, that 
are not infected with this disease. Here 
it is not impertinent to note, that where 
y=e= Plague raigneth, there are scarsly any 
other diseases besides, or if there be, they 
wil shortly after be turned into it This 
is the opinion of learned Physitians, 
and seemeth to agree with reason. For if 
euil humors, make a man apt to receiue 
infection: it is not maruell that they whiche 
are diseased (bycause their sicknesse 
proceedeth of corruption in the bodie,) be 
infected with the Pestile~ce, if they come 
within the compasse of the venomous 
aire. Therfore D. Faire in his treatise of 
the Pestilence, sayeth for a certaintie: 
What childe so euer is vexed wyth the 
wormes in time of the Plague, is infected 
with it. For it is a matter (sayth he) 
so disposed to the Pestilence, as Brimstone 
is to be kindled of the fire. Thys 
[^f.C5r^] 
may suffise: as touching the signes and 
tokens of the disease. 
 
[}The eleauenth Chapter speaketh of 
the cure of the Pestilence, and sheweth 
the vertues of Carduus 
Benedictus.}] 
 
LIke as for preseruetiues, so for the 
cure of this disease, mani things are 
prescribed of Phisitians: as choice of 
meats, perfumes, letting of bloud, cupping, 
vomiting, electuaries, pilles, potions, 
pouders and plasters: al which, (as 
ouer costly) I omit: which, they that are 
disposed, may vnderstand in other mens 
writings. I mind onely to set downe the 
vertues of two hearbes, vz. Carduus 
Benedictus, and Angelica: which being 
known, as they may help against many 
infirmities, so they are much commended, 
both as preseruatiues, & medicines 
against this disease. Howbeit, it seemeth 
they were knowne but of late yeares. 
For Doctour Turner writeth of them, 
among those wherof there is no mention 
[^f.C5v^] 
made of Dioscorides, Galene, Plinie, 
and other old Authors. Also that which 
he writeth expressely of Carduus Benedictus, 
doth signifie the same. Although 
(saith he) dyuers of the later writers, 
haue gone aboute to make Carduus Benedictus, 
a kind of Atractilis: yet for al 
that, the description is found not perfectly 
to agree vnto it. It is written that 
[/20./] 
it was set out of India, vnto the Emperoure 
Fredericke, as a pretious medicine 
against many diseases, and griefs. 
It is called in English most co~monly, 
Cardo Benedictus: and in Italian, Herba 
Turcha. Thus he writeth of the 
Hearbe, and after sheweth the 
vertues thereof out of the 
later writers. 
[^Three dots forming a point-down triangle.^] 
 
[^f.C6r^] 
[}The vertues of Carduus 
Benedictus, that is to saye in Englishe, 
The blessed Thistle: which for the operation 
and greate efficacie, that GOD 
hath giuen vnto it, may wel be so called: 
the properties wherof are diligently gathered 
oute of D. Turners Herball, 
and other vvriters, and partly 
proued by the 
Gatherer.}] 
 
[}First it helpeth the heade and 
the partes thereof.}] 
 
THe hearbe eaten, or the 
Pouder or iuyce of the 
hearb drunke keepeth a 
man from the head ach, 
and migram, and also 
dryueth it away, when 
it is gotten. Being taken in meate or 
drinke, it is good againste disinesse, and 
the swimming giddinesse of the heade: 
it comforteth the brayne, sharpeneth 
the witte, strengthneth memorie, it is 
a singular remedye agaynste deafenesse: 
for it amendeth thicke hearing. 
It prouoketh sleepe. The iuyce of it 
layde vnto the eyes, quickeneth the 
[^f.C6v^] 
sight: Also the water in the whiche the 
pouder, or hearbe dryed is steeped, hathe 
the same effecte, if the eies be washed 
therewith. The hearbe eaten, is good for 
the same purpose. The water or iuyce 
dropped into the eies, cureth the reddenesse, 
bloudshotten, and itching of them. 
 
And some write, that it doth strengthen 
the teeth, they being washed & rubbed 
with a cloth dipped in the water or 
iuyce thereof. The pouder stauncheth 
bloude, that floweth out of the nose, being 
applied to the place. 
 
[}Secondly, it helpeth the stomacke.}] 
 
THe brothe of the hearbe, otherwyse 
called the decoction, drunk in wine, 
is good for an euill stomack it helpeth a 
weake stomack, & causeth an appetite to 
meate. Also the wine wherin it hath bin 
boiled, doth cleanse, and mundifie the infected 
stomacke. The pouder therof eaten 
with Hony, or drunk in wine, dothe 
ripe, and digest colde flegme, purgeth, & 
bringeth vp that which is in the breast, 
[^f.C7r^] 
scouring the same of grosse humors, and 
causeth to fetch breath more easily. The 
hearb chewed in the mouth, healeth the 
stinche of the breath. 
 
[}Thirdly, it helpeth the heart.}] 
 
THe pouder being take~ before a ma~ 
be infected, preserueth him from y=e= 
Pestilence. And a dram of it, or a Walnutte 
shell full, taken immediatly after 
a man feeleth himselfe infected, expelleth 
the venome of the pestilent infection fro~ 
the heart: so that if a man sweate afterwarde, 
he shal be deliuered incontinent. 
The same effect hath the herb, boiled in 
wine, or in the vrine of a healthful man 
child, & drunke. I mean the decoction, or 
licour, from the which the herb is strained, 
after that it hath bin boiled therin. 
 
The leaues, pouder, iuyce, or water 
of the herbe drunk, and the patient well 
couered with clothes, and sweting three 
houres, expelleth all poyson taken in at 
the mouth, and other corruption, that 
doth hurt and annoy the heart. 
 
[^f.C7v^] 
[}Finally, it helpeth the Liuer, Lungs, 
and other partes of the body.}] 
 
THe hearb boyled in wine and dru~k 
hote aboute a quarter of an houre 
before the fit, and the patient afterward 
wel couered in the bed, driueth away al 
agues. The pouder & water of the herb 
drunk with wine, hath the same effecte. 
The iuyce drunke with wine, is good againste 
shorte wind, & the diseases of the 
Lungs. Also it is good against y=e= ach of y=e= 
body: it strengthneth the me~bers of y=e= 
whole body. The herb boiled in y=e= vrine 
of a helthful manchild, and drunke, doeth 
help against the Dropsie: breaketh 
all Aposthumes: maistereth the falling 
sicknesse. The pouder eaten or drunke, 
helpeth againste the stitches in the side. 
It is also good for them, that beginne to 
haue the Consumption, called the Ptisicke. 
The herbe eaten, doth strengthen 
the trembling and palsy members. The 
pouder ministred in a Clister, helpeth a 
gainst the Collick, & other diseases of y=e= 
[/21./] 
guts. The water drunke, hath the same 
[^f.C8r^] 
effect. The iuice drunk with wine, or the 
hearbe boiled in wine, and drunke hote, 
breaketh the stone, and driueth out grauell: 
being sodden in water, and the patient 
sitting ouer it, so that the hote vapoure 
may come vnto the diseased place, 
it helpeth againste the same infirmitie. 
After the same maner being vsed, it is 
good against the greene sicknesse. Also it 
healeth the griping paines of the belly: 
it openeth the stopping of the me~bers, 
pearceth and causeth vrine. The leaues 
boyled in wine, and drunke as is aforesaide, 
prouoke sweate: consume the euill 
bloude, and ingender the good. Also the 
wine or water, in the which the hearbe 
is boiled, being drunke, consumeth the 
euill humors, and preserueth the good. 
It is good for one that is brused wyth a 
fall, or otherwise. The leaues, iuyce, 
broth, pouder, and water of the herbe, is 
very good to heale the canker, & olde rotten 
festered sores. The leaues brused, or 
punnd, and laid to, are good against burnings, 
hote swellings, carbuncles, and 
sores that be hard to be cured, especia_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ly 
[^f.C8v^] 
for them of the pestilence: and also they 
are good to heale the bitings of venomous 
worms, and serpents, or creeping 
beasts. Finally, the downe, comming 
of the floures thereof, when the seede is 
ripe, doth heale cuts and newe wounds, 
without paine. 
 
Thus much of Carduus Benedictus 
gathered oute of the Herbals of diuers 
learned men, which although it may be 
sufficient, yet I haue thoughte good here 
to sette downe that, which two painfull 
and skilfull Physitions, Matthiolus, and 
Fuchsius, haue written hereof in Latin: 
whose words, as (perhappes) they may 
bring some credite to that whiche is alreadye 
written: so in them something 
more may be learned, or at the lest somthing 
is vttered for the better vndersta~ding 
of that aforesaide. Their wordes 
in English are as followeth. 
 
[}The properties of Carduus Benedictus, 
out of Matthiolus.}] 
 
CArduus Benedictus, is a plante of 
gret name and fame, specially against 
[^f.D1r^] 
the Pestilence, and also againste deadly 
poysons: aswell taken inwardly, as laid 
outwardly to the stingings, and bitings 
of venomous beasts. They are healed 
with this herbe, that are sicke of a quartane, 
or other Agues that come with a 
colde: and that by the drinking of the 
decoction, or stilled water, or a dramme 
of the pouder: in like maner being dro~k, 
it helpeth infa~ts that are troubled with 
the falling sicknesse. The decoctio~ taken 
in Wine, doth mitigate the paine of the 
guttes, and reines, and other griefes of 
the belly. It prouoketh sweat. It killeth 
the wormes, and helpeth againste other 
diseases of the wombe. The hearbe it 
selfe, aswell greene, as dried, both drunk 
& laid outwardly to the grief, doth heale 
y=e= greeuous, & swelling soares called Ulcers: 
(that is, such as breede in the fleshe, 
without any outward cause, as a stripe 
with a weapon, or biting of a beast) & couereth 
the flesh with skin. Therefore, it 
is mingled with y=e= drinke made of Guacum, 
wine, and water, for the~ that haue 
y=e= Fre~ch pocks. Thus much Mathiolus. 
 
[^f.D1v^] 
[}The properties of Carduus Benedictus, 
out of Fuchsius.}] 
 
CArduus Benedictus taketh awaie y=e= 
stoppings of the inward bowels: it 
prouoketh vrine: breaketh the stone: and 
helpeth them that are stung of venomous 
beastes. They saye also, that they 
are not infected, that take it in theyr 
meate, or drinke, before they come into 
the euill aire: and manye doe persuade 
themselues, that it muche helpeth them 
that are alreadie infected. Moreouer, all 
men agree vpon this: that it is a remedy 
against the bitings of Serpe~ts & Scorpions. 
Finally, the later writers saye, 
that it cureth very greate paines of the 
head, taketh away giddinesse, recouereth 
the memorie, being taken in meate, or 
drink: also y=t= it healeth festering soares, 
especially of the Pappes, and Teats, if 
the pouder thereof be laid vpon it. Thus 
muche Fuchsius. 
 
By this we vndersta~d, with how 
great vertue, God hath indued, & (as I 
may say) hath blessed this herbe. It helpeth 
[^f.D2r^] 
the body within and without. It 
helpeth almost all the principall members 
of the body, as the braine, the hart, 
the stomack, the liuer, lungs, & kidneys. 
I may say it is a preseruatiue against al 
diseases: for it prouoketh sweat, wherby 
the body is purged of much corruption, 
which doth breede diseases. Also it expelleth 
all venome and infection. It consumeth 
euill bloud, and all naughtie humors, 
whereof all diseases are ingendred. 
Therfore giuing God thankes for 
his goodnesse, which hath giuen vs thys 
hearb, and all other things for our commoditie, 
lette vs vse it as neede shall require. 
 
[}The twelfth Chapter sheweth, howe 
Carduus Benedictus may be taken.}] 
 
HEre is to be noted, that we may vse 
this herb, & enioy the vertues therof 
foure maner waies. First in the greene 
leafe: secondly in the pouder: thirdly, in 
the iuyce: and fourthly, in the distilled 
water. Unto these may be added the licour, 
[^f.D2v^] 
in whiche the hearbe is boiled. 
For the most part, the vertue that is in 
Sinne, is in them all: so that in dyuers 
diseases, for the which the hearb is medicinable, 
for lack of the one, a man may 
vse the other. The greene leafe may be 
taken with bread and butter, as we vse 
to take Sage and Parcely in a morning 
to breakefast. And if it seeme too bitter 
in the taste, it may be take~ with hony in 
steade of butter. It may be also taken in 
potage boiled among other hearbs. Finally, 
being shred small, it may be very 
well drunke with Ale, Beere, or Wine: 
specially posset ale, or burnt wine. It is 
giuen somtimes in Beere with some Aqua 
Composita put to it, & that without 
any harme, when the stomack of the patient 
is weake, & he not trobled with any 
hote disease. The iuice of it is either 
outwardely applied to the bodie, (as is 
also the leafe, pouder, and water sometymes:) 
or else it is receyued by the 
mouth into the body. 
 
Being receiued into the body, it may 
be taken in Potage, euen as the greene 
[^f.D3r^] 
leafe: or with Wine: which if it be burned 
and drunke hote, it is the better. If 
you list, you may boile it with Wine, & 
Hony, or Sugar to make it sweete, and 
then drinke it warme. 
 
The pouder may be taken with hony 
vpon a kniues point, or with bread and 
Hony if you list, or else it may be drunk 
with Ale, Beere, or Wine. The distilled 
water may be drunk by it selfe alone, or 
else with white Wine before meate, or 
with Sack after meate, specially if the 
stomack be weake and colde. 
 
The licour or brothe in the whiche 
the hearb is boiled, maye be made thus. 
Take a quart of running water, seeth it 
& skim it, the~ put into it a good handfull 
of the hearbe, and let it boile vntill the 
better parte of the licour be consumed: 
then drinke it with wine, or if you liste 
with Honie, or Sugare, to make it the 
more pleasa~t in the tast. Or else make a 
potion on this wise: Take a good handfull 
of the leaues, wyth an handfull of 
raisons of the Sun, washed and stoned, 
and some sugar Candie, & Licorise slyced 
[^f.D3v^] 
small, boyle them all togither in a 
quarte of water, ale, or wine: if it be too 
bitter it maye be made sweete, as is afore 
saide. 
 
Moreouer, it is to be noted, that the 
pouder and water of the hearb is moste 
to be regarded, and specially the water: 
for they may be long preserued, so that a 
man may haue them alwayes in a readinesse 
to vse, as need shall require, whe~ 
as he cannot haue y=e= iuice, nor the grene 
leafe. And the water (which only is void 
of bitternesse) may be drunke by it selfe 
alone: for the stomacke and taste wyll 
beare it, and like of it aswel as of Rose-water. 
Notwithstanding, if the seede bee 
sowne as soone as it is ripe, a man maye 
haue the hearb both winter and so~mer, 
fro~ the time that it beginneth to grow, 
vntill the seede waxe ripe againe. Therfore 
I councell all them that haue Gardens, 
to nourish it, that they may haue it 
always for their owne vse, and the vse 
of their neighbors that lacke it. 
 
[^f.D4r^] 
[}The thirteenth Chapiter speaketh of 
the time, and quantity, to be obserued 
in taking of Carduus Benedictus.}] 
 
HEre (perhaps) some man will aske a 
question of y=e= time, & qua~tity: which 
things are to be considered in taking of 
medicines. As touching the time, if it be 
taken for a preseruatiue, it is good to 
take it in the morning, or in the euening 
before a man go to bed, bicause that is a 
conuenient time to sweat, for him, y=t= feeleth 
not himselfe greatly diseased. But 
if a ma~ take it to expel any disease, it is 
good to take it whe~soeuer he feeleth any 
greefe in his body, and immediatly to go 
to bedde and sweate. Howbeit it is 
not necessarie vppon euerye griefe to 
sweat, after the taking of the medicine. 
 
As touching the quantie, a man neede 
not be so carefull in taking this hearbe, 
as in taking those medicines, that doe 
purge veheme~tly, by egression, (as some 
terme it,) or by vomite. For in taking 
them, if great discretion be not vsed, in 
considering the time, the quantitie, and 
[^f.D4v^] 
the state of a ma~s body, they may cause 
presente deathe: or otherwise they maye 
muche trouble a man. But in ministring 
this hearb, it is not so: in taking 
wherof a man may vse his owne discretion, 
and the iudgement of his stomack. 
 
This I counsell all men that minde 
to vse it, y=t= when they or anye of theirs, 
are diseased, they deferre not the time, 
but take it presently, as soone as it may 
be gotten: and that they do not think it 
sufficient to take it once: but that they 
take it three or foure times at the least. 
 
[}The fourteenth Chapter sheweth 
the properties of Angelica.}] 
 
NOw I haue written that I thinke 
sufficie~t of Carduus Benedictus, bicause 
(perhaps) ynough of it cannot bee 
gotten for them that haue neede: I will 
adde vnto it an other herb of much like 
vertue, called Angelica, that if the one 
be lacking the other may be taken. As 
touching the name, the latest writers, in 
my iudgeme~t most to be credited in this 
[^f.D5r^] 
matter, find no other name for it, neither 
in Englishe nor in Latine. Howbeit, I 
knowe that some, much to be commended 
for their learning, & also for the publishing 
of the same, to y=e= benefite of their 
countrie, haue giuen it other names: 
but I thinke by errour. If we English 
it as the Latine word soundeth, we may 
call it, Hearbe Angel: or, the Angelical 
or Angelike Hearbe. Uppon what occasion 
this excellent name was first giuen 
vnto it, I know not: vnlesse it were 
for the excellent vertues thereof, or for 
that God made it knowe~ to man, by the 
ministerie of an Angel. I suppose the 
former cause rather to be true. Howbeit, 
as I am not able to proue the other: 
so I thinke no ma~ can giue any good reason 
to the contrarie. For this we know, 
that GOD hath made his Angels ministring 
spirites, to serue vs, for the safegarde 
of our soules, and also of our bodies. 
But vppon what occasion so euer 
the name was giuen, it is excellent, and 
so are the properties: which be these that 
follow. 
 
[^f.D5v^] 
[}The Vertues of Angelica, out of 
D. Turners Herball.}] 
 
ANgelica is hote, and drye, at the 
leaste in the third degree. All the latter 
writers agree vppon this, and experience 
proueth the same: that it is good 
against poyson, pestilent aires, and the 
Pestilence it selfe. The Practicioners of 
Germanie write thus of it: If auy man 
be sodenly taken, eyther with any Pestilence, 
or with any sodaine pestilente Ague, 
or with too much sodayn sweatting: 
let him drinke of the pouder of the root, 
halfe a dramme, mingled with a dram 
of Triacle, in three or foure sponefulles 
of the water of Angelica, distilled out 
of the rootes, and after go to bed, and couer 
himselfe well, and fast (at the leaste) 
three houres after: which if he doe, he 
shall beginne to sweate, and by the 
helpe of GOD, he shall be deliuered 
from his disease. For lacke of Triacle, a 
man may take a whole dramme of the 
root of Angelica in pouder, with so much 
of the distilled water as is aforesayde, & 
[^f.D6r^] 
it will haue the same effect. The roote 
of Angelica wel steeped in Uinegre, and 
smelled vpon in time of the Pestilence: 
and the same Uineger, being sometime 
dronke fasting, saueth a ma~s body from 
y=e= Pestilence. But in my iudgement, it is 
better to take an Orenge, or Lemmon, 
cutte off the toppe, picke out the meate, 
pricke it fall of small holes, put into it a 
piece of a Sponge, Wool, Cotten, or fine 
linnen Cloth, dipped in the foresayd Uineger, 
and diuerse times smell vnto it. 
 
For the better keping in of the sponge 
or cotten, &c. you maye fasten the toppe 
vnto it againe, with a threed, as they do 
a cappe vnto a paire of kniues. With 
this you may be bolder to venter where 
the Pestilence is, than if you had a great 
sort of other medicines. 
 
The water distilled out of the rootes 
of Angelica, or the pouder of the same, is 
good againste gnawing and paine of the 
bellie, that commeth with colde, if the 
bodie be not bounde withall. And it is 
good against all inwarde diseases: as the 
Pleurisie, in the beginning, before the 
[^f.D6v^] 
heate of the inflamation be come into 
the bodie. For it disolueth and scattereth 
abroade such humours, as vseth to giue 
matter to the Pleurisie. Moreouer, it 
is good for the diseases of the Lunges, if 
they come of a colde cause: and for the 
Stranguria~ of a cold cause, or of a stopping. 
It is good for a woman that is 
in trauell with childe. It is good also to 
driue winde away that is in the bodye, 
and to ease the paine that commeth of 
the same. The roote may be sodden in 
water, or in wine, as the nature of him 
that is sicke doth require. The iuyce of 
the roote, put into an hollowe tooth, taketh 
away the ache, and so likewise doth 
the distilled water put in at the eare. 
 
Moreouer, the iuyce, and the water also 
of Angelica, quickem the eye sight, and 
breake the little filmes that go ouer the 
eyes: wherof darknesse doth rise. Of the 
rootes of Angelica, and Pitche, maye be 
made a good Emplaster, against the bytings 
of madde beastes. The water, 
the iuyce, or the pouder of the root, sprinkled 
vpon the diseased place, is a verye 
[^f.D7r^] 
good remedie against old, and deep sores. 
For they do scoure, and clense them, and 
couer the bones with fleshe. The water 
of the same, in a colde cause, is good to be 
layd on places diseased with the Goute, 
and Sciatica. For it stancheth the pain, 
and melteth awaye the tough humours 
that are gathered togither. The seede is 
of like vertue with y=e= root. The wild Angelica, 
that groweth here, in the lowe 
woods, and by the water sides, is not of 
suche vertue, as the other is: Howbeit, 
the Surgions vse to seeth y=e= roote of it in 
Wine, to heale greene woundes. These 
Properties, I haue gathered out of the 
Practicioners of the Germanes: I haue 
not as yet proued them all my selfe, but 
diuerse of them I haue proued, and haue 
founde them to be true. Al these are D. 
Turners woordes, sauing that in stead of 
a costly hollowe ball of Siluer, Tinne, 
or Iuniper wood, I haue set downe the 
peele of an Orenge, or Le~mon: the meat 
whereof is also commended by Physitians, 
to be both a preseruatiue, and a medicine, 
agaynst poyson, and the infection 
[^f.D7v^] 
of the Pestilence. 
 
[}The vertues of Angelica out of an 
other learned man.}] 
 
THe late writers say, y=t= the rootes of 
Angelica are co~trarie to al poison, 
the Pestilence, and all naughtie corruptio~, 
or euil, or infected aire. If any bodie 
be infected with y=e= Pestile~ce or Plague, 
or els is poisoned, they giue him streight 
way to drinke a dramme of the pouder 
of this roote, with Wine, in the winter: 
and in Summer, with the distilled water 
of Carduus Benedictus: then they 
bring him to bedde, and couer him, vntil 
he haue swette well. The same roote 
being taken fasting in the morning, or 
but onely holden in the mouthe, doeth 
keepe, and preserue the bodie, from the 
infection of the Pestilence, and from all 
euil aire, and poison. They say also, that 
the leaues of Angelica, pownd with the 
leaues of Rue, and Honie, are verie good 
to be layde vnto the bitinges of madde 
Dogges, Serpentes, and Uipers: if in- [^The word breaks here, the following page beginning with a repetition of the last 11 lines of this page.^] 
[^f.D8r^] 
bring him to bedde, and couer him, vntill 
he haue swett well. The same roote 
being taken fasting in the morning, or 
but onely holden in the mouthe, doeth 
keepe, and preserue the bodie, from the 
infection of the Pestilence, and from all 
euill aire, and poyson. They say also, that 
the leaue of Angelica, pound with the 
leaues of Rue, and Honie, are verie good 
to be laide vnto the bitinges of madde 
Dogges, Serpents, and Uipers: if incontinent 
after the hurte, the Wine be 
dronk, wherein the roote, or leaues of 
Angelica haue boyled. 
 
[}The Conclusion of the Booke.}] 
 
THus muche I haue thought good to 
write of the Plague, & of these hearbs 
Carduus Benedictus, & Angelica: whiche 
(as some men vse to speake,) is called a 
great secret: either bicause it is not knowen 
to many men, or else bycause they 
would haue it kept close, and knowne 
but to a few. But I do not thinke meete, 
that any thing should be secrete, which 
may be profitable for man. For GOD 
hath not made any thing for the vse of a 
[^f.D8v^] 
fewe, but for the commoditie of all me_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
And we y=t= are the children of God, ough_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
to frame our selues so, that we may b_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
like affectioned vnto our father, who i_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
beneficiall to all men: who hath mad_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
his Sunne to shine, & his raine to raine 
vpon the wicked, as well as vpon th_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
good, that is to say: who feedeth all me_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
both good and bad. For by heat and mo_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sture, 
which proceede from the Sunn_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
and the raine, all things growe vpon th_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
earth, whereby mans life is mainteined. 
Hereof I conclude, that for as much as 
Almightie God is good vnto all men, we 
ought to be like minded, and not to keepe 
any thing secrete, nor to hide any thing 
from man that may profite him. Thus I 
make an end, willing all men rightly to 
vse the good creatures of God, and to 
giue him heartie thankes for 
all his benefites.
