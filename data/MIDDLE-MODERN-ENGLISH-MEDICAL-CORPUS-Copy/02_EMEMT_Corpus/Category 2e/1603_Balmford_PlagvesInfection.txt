[}A short Dialogue concerning 
the Plagues 
infection.}] 
 
[}Professor.}] 
 
SIR, I make bold to trouble 
you, and to desire your resolution 
in a point wherewith I 
finde the minds of manie honest 
men (better acquainted with the 
Scriptures than I am) much cumbred and 
perplexed: I cannot be quiet till I be resolued; 
therefore pardon my boldnesse I 
pray you. 
 
[}Preacher.}] Neighbour, you are very 
welcome: for I take you to be of that 
discretion, that you will not (as manie 
do) trouble your selfe and others with 
friuolous, or curious questions. And 
therefore if I were as able as willing, 
you should not go away vnresolued: 
[^p.2^] 
but you shall haue mine opinion with 
all faithfulnesse, and then iudge therof 
in the sobrietie of wisedome. Tell me 
then: What is the matter? 
 
[}Prof.}] May it please you: We heare 
your selfe, and other faithfull Preachers 
in this Citie, reproue such as (for the co~fort 
of their soules) come to Church, either 
with plague sores, or out of infected 
houses. As also those, that of charitie visite 
such as haue the plague, and accompanie 
the diseased of that disease, vnto 
the graue. In all which duties we thinke 
(with your fauor) that Preachers should 
rather incourage then discourage vs. 
Now because I am vnder your ministerie, 
and you haue publikely willed vs to 
resort to you for satisfaction, if we either 
vnderstand not, or approue not any 
thing by you deliuered: I am bold to 
come and craue your satisfaction accordingly. 
 
[}Preach.}] You do well, & I thank you: 
for there be too many that runne counter 
in a contrarie course. For whereas 
[/1./] 
they should be swift to heare and slow 
[/2./] 
to speake, they haue heauie eares, and 
[^p.3^] 
readie tongues to speake euil of things 
[/3./] 
they know not, and so scandalize (that 
[/4./] 
is, stumble) themselues and other, in 
hearing the word, which is to be heard 
[/5./] 
not as the words of men, but as indeed 
the word of God. But I pray you tell 
me, in what sense, and for what reasons 
haue you obserued me and other 
Preachers to reproue the offendors 
you speake of? 
 
[}Prof.}] Truely Sir, sith you put me to 
it, I must acknowledge mine infirmitie: 
for assoone as I heare you or other begin 
to checke Pietie and Charitie, (so seeming 
to me) I am presently so troubled, 
that I cannot vnderstand, much lesse 
rightly remember, what hath bene deliuered. 
 
[}Preach.}] If it be so with you, who 
professe the obedience of faith, how is 
it with the rude multitude, whose imaginations 
are in no good sort brought 
into captiuitie to the obedience of 
Christ? But we see the words of Christ 
fulfilled: That we do not vnderstand 
[/6./] 
his talke, because we cannot heare his 
word. Me thinkes, professors should 
[^p.4^] 
attribute so much to their teachers, yea 
such as they acknowledge to be faithfull, 
[/7/] 
as to heare with the Athenians, 
and to examine with the Bereans. For 
[/8./] 
doth the law of God iudge a man, before 
it heare him? But truely ye presume 
too farre in censuring your teachers, 
as those that checke Pietie and 
Charitie. What? Is this Pietie, with 
an high hand to breake godly Orders 
of a gracious Prince set downe for preseruation 
of life? Is this Charitie, presumptuously 
to hazard the liues, God 
knoweth of how many? Is this either 
Pietie or Charitie, wilfully to runne 
our selues into mortall daunger? 
 
[}Prof.}] I am enforced of conscience to 
confesse it to be a fault, that we haue presumed 
to censure our teachers, and that 
so seuerely, before we well vnderstood 
and humbly examined their doctrine: 
for by our deed we speake that in Gods 
eares, which irreligious people, by word 
vttered to Ieremiah his face, viz. The 
[/9./] 
word that thou hast spoken vnto vs in the 
name of the Lord, we wil not heare it of thee; 
but we will do whatsoeuer goeth out of our 
[^p.5^] 
owne mouth. But pardon me, and let me 
now with your patience intreate you to 
proue, not by mans pollicie, but by Gods 
word (according to your profession) that 
Princes may inhibit, or forbid the works 
of Pietie and Charitie. 
 
[}Preach.}] Neighbour, you still begge 
the question, which is the common fallacie 
of the common sort, who dote vpon 
whatsoeuer commeth out of their 
owne mouth, as you said. For it is in 
question, whether the workes you co~mend, 
be the workes of Pietie & Charitie 
or no. But I will shew you by the 
word of God, that Princes both may 
and ought keepe from assemblies, such 
as be no lesse daungerous to them, tha~ 
one scabbed sheepe is to an whole flock, 
and restraine the whole and sound fro~ 
vnnecessarie running into eminent 
daunger. This I will do vpon condition, 
that you will then shew me, what 
reasons you haue to doubt of so cleere a 
truth, or obiect against any thing I 
haue said, or shall say, that I may either 
satisfie you, or reforme mine own 
iudgement. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}Prof.}] If I do not so, my second error 
will be worse than the former: for then I 
should be like them that pretended with 
protestation to be informed by Ieremiah, 
[/10./] 
but yet obeyed not his voyce, when it 
was against their mind: for the truth is, 
the longer we talke, the more I remember 
what is muttered by the common, 
and what obiected by the better sort. 
 
[}Preach.}] Upon this condition I proceed, 
yet so, as not intending any large 
discourse: for I neede not, speaking to a 
professour; and I would you should 
haue time enough to propound al your 
doubts. In one word therefore consider 
well this argument: Kings and 
[/11./] 
Queenes ought to be nurcing fathers 
[/12./] 
and nurcing mothers to the Church, so 
as that Gods people may leade a quiet 
and a peaceable life, in all godlinesse 
and honestie. But this is an honest 
thing before God and men, that Kings 
should (out of a fatherly care) preserue 
their subiects from destruction, by infection, 
[/13./] 
as wel as by the sword. As Dauid 
was no lesse carefull for his people, 
when the Pestilence raged, than valiant 
[^p.7^] 
in defending them against their enemies. 
Againe, what other thing do 
sundrie lawes and customes of Israel 
teach vs? Priests were forbidden to 
[/14./] 
drinke wine or strong drinke, that they 
might put difference betweene the 
cleane and vncleane: that euery leaper 
[/15./] 
and euery one that had an issue, and 
whosoeuer is defiled by the dead, shold 
be put out of the host: that garments 
[/16./] 
and houses defiled by leprosie, should 
be destroyed: that euery one to do the 
[/17./] 
worke of nature, should go out of the 
hoast: and that the dead were buried 
[/18./] 
out of the citie. What (I say) do these 
[/19./] 
lawes and customes (well considered) 
[/20./] 
teach vs in their equity, but that Gods 
people should be carefully preserued 
from filthinesse and contagion? Let vs 
a litle better consider the lawes of Lepers, 
as most nearely concerning vs, 
and we shall find that they were not 
onely to haue markes to be known by, 
but also to giue warning to companie 
[/21./] 
approaching, by saying: I am vncleane, 
I am vncleane. Whereby it is euident, 
that Lepers should shunne other, and 
[^p.8^] 
other should shun them. And it is as euident, 
that they were not to come into 
the house of God. For a King being a 
[/22./] 
Leper, was kept out thereof all the 
dayes of his life. Much more may Moses 
[/23./] 
(a Magistrate) shut Miriam (though 
his sister) out of the hoast for 7. dayes. 
But the plague is more daungerously 
[/24./] 
contagious being mortall, then the Leprosie 
which is not mortall: therefore 
Princes and Magistrates (which are 
called sheapheards) may and ought to 
be very carefull, to keepe the sound fro~ 
the infected, and the infected from the 
sound, especially in assemblies. As the 
sheapheard is carefull to keepe scabbed 
sheepe from his flocke, and his flocke 
from scabbed sheepe. Let this suffice for 
this time: let me now heare your 
doubts. 
 
[}Prof.}] As king Agrippa said vnto Paul: 
Almost thou perswadest me to become a 
[/25./] 
Christian, so I may say, you haue almost 
chaunged my mind. But yet for my promise 
sake, and for further resolution, I 
will propound certaine doubts: and will 
first begin with that which I know doth 
[^p.9^] 
most trouble most men, especially of the 
poorer sort. To wit, they thinke it most 
extreame crueltie, to be barred from going 
abroad to seeke reliefe or maintenance 
for them and theirs, except they 
either had sufficient of their owne, or 
their wants were supplied. 
 
[}Preach.}] I am of the same mind: for 
Lepers might go abroad to seeke reliefe: 
[/26./] 
but yet in such sort, as hath bene 
shewed. And so I could wish that our 
[/27./] 
infected poore, sith they must needs go abroad, 
wold reme~ber y=e= 10. Lepers, how 
they stood afar off, & lift vp their voyce, 
when they craued helpe of our Sauior: 
so they would go abroad in such sort as 
authoritie directeth: to wit, out of the 
most frequented way, and with a rod 
in their hand. I say with griefe (must 
needes) for if authoritie had regarded 
these things betimes, when there were 
but few infected houses, they might 
haue bene well shut vp and prouided 
for, till they were cleansed, either of 
their owne, or the common charges. 
But what say you to those, who are 
not so poore, but that they may keepe 
[^p.10^] 
their houses at their owne charges, till 
they be cleansed? 
 
[}Profess.}] They thinke it an hell to be 
so long shut vp from companie and their 
businesse: the neglecting whereof is the 
decay of their state. 
 
[}Preach.}] Indeed this impatiencie is 
the cause why so many smother the 
plague in themselues and their families, 
so long as they can to the hazarding 
of life: but I aduise them to consider 
the resolution of Paul, which was, 
[/28./] 
neuer to eate flesh rather then he would 
offend his brother: much more ought 
they patiently to endure a litle restraint 
and losse, rather then to indanger 
[/29./] 
the life of many. O Bloud is a grieuous 
[/30./] 
and crying sinne! and therefore 
[/31./] 
Dauid would not drinke the water of 
the well of Beth-lehem though he longed 
for it, because it was gotten with 
the ieopardy of liues, but called it blood. 
[/32./] 
Let them beleeue that God is able to 
giue them more then they loose by following 
his direction. Let them know 
what this is: I will haue mercie, and not 
[/33./] 
sacrifice. Let them shew their faith by 
[^p.11^] 
patience. For he that beleeueth, maketh 
[/34./] 
no hast, being assured of Gods promise: 
that in quietnes and confidence shall be 
their strength. Let them imitate Moses 
[/35./] 
and Aaron, who were as hastie in behalf 
of their sister Miriam, but yet were perswaded 
by God to shut her out of the 
host seuen dayes. Thus much for these 
goers abroad. But what say you now 
for those that come to Church, in whose 
behalfe you seemed much affected at the 
first. 
 
[}Profess.}] I was indeed affected as I seemed: 
but that which you haue said to goers 
abroade, belonging for the most part 
to commers to Church, hath stopped my 
mouth: and the rather because I remember 
the King, who was kept from the 
Temple, whiles he liued, for the Leprosie. 
[/36./] 
Why then (thinke I) should not the 
infected with the Plague be content to 
forbeare for a while, sith in the Plague 
they vsually mend or end in short time? 
 
[}Preach.}] God be praised, for now you 
vnderstand and remember well, I haue 
therefore the lesse to say: only this, touching 
the comfort of soule, which they 
[^p.12^] 
desire by comming to Church. I pray 
them examine what true comfort they 
can haue, when they consider that they 
are more dangerous than they who go 
abroad. For in the Church they sit by it, 
and that in a throng and heat: whereas 
if they humble themselues vnder Gods 
hand, and tarie at home, though taking 
it as a part of their crosse that they keep 
so long from the Church; I doubt not 
but that they shall find God (who turneth 
his childrens bed in time of sicknesse) 
[/37./] 
as a sanctuary to them. And this 
[/38./] 
I further say, that he rather is in the assembly 
[/39./] 
of saints, who is there in spirit, 
[/40./] 
though absent in body; then he that is 
present in body, but absent in spirit. 
 
[}Profess.}] All this (I vnderstand) concernes 
such as being infected themselues, 
do yet come to Church. But what say you 
to those who haue spacious houses, so as 
they come not neere the sicke of their family, 
and be sound themselues: may not 
they come to Church as well as those, betweene 
whom and the infected there is 
but a wall? 
 
[}Preach.}] They may, as I am perswaded. 
[^p.13^] 
But all things are not expedient 
[/41./] 
which are lawfull. For many too foolishly 
fearefull (another extremitie of this 
time, as generall and daungerous, as 
Presumption) knowing their houses to 
be infected, wil verily suppose that they 
haue beene about the sicke, and that the 
plague is in their garments; and therefore 
if it fal out so that they sit together, 
their fearefull conceipt may breede the 
Plague. 
 
[}Profess.}] O sir, are you of that mind, 
that the Plague may be in a garment, and 
the partie not sicke; and that one may 
take the Plague onely with feare, and do 
you beare with such a conceipt? 
 
[}Preach.}] No, I do not. But I deeme 
them guiltie of their owne bane, who 
take it with such a conceipt. And yet I 
thinke euery charitable Christian will 
grieue at the heart, that he should be the 
occasion of such a fright, and could wish 
that he had rather been from the church 
a moneth, especially being in some sort 
Gods prisoner, and the affrighted hauing 
likelyhoods that either he or his 
garment might be infected. That a garment 
[^p.14^] 
may be infected, and the Plague 
taken onely by feare, experience and 
reason do make manifest. Concerning 
the former, it hath beene proued that 
clothes of infected persons layed vp and 
not well ayred, being opened though a 
yeere or more after, haue instantly renewed 
y=e= Plague. Againe, we perceiue 
by the smell that garments wil retaine 
the sent of Wormewood or muske for a 
long time: the cause is not in the sent 
by it selfe considered, but in the ayre 
which is the subiect of the sent. The 
plague in a garment is a poysoned aire 
(being according to the nature thereof 
called by the learned the Death of the 
ayre) proceeding from the partie infected, 
and infecting the garment, though 
not perceiued by smell: as the open, 
cleere and wholesome ayre of the heauens 
is healthfull for the body, though 
[/42./] 
not perceuied by smell. Lastly, leprosie 
infecteth garments: and he that sleepeth 
or eateth in an house, shut vp for leprosie, 
must wash his clothes: which argueth 
that infection may be by the ayre, 
sith a man may eate in the house, and 
[^p.15^] 
not touch the walles infected. If Leprosie 
be so contagious, much more the 
Plague, which is a stronger poyson, because 
it infecteth and killeth. 
 
[}Profess.}] This is more then euer I heard 
and considered, and I think it reasonable: 
but I cannot conceiue how the garment 
can be infected, and yet the person that 
weareth it escape the Plague. 
 
[}Preach.}] I will shew you that in a 
word. Do you not consider that either 
the infection may be but weake, or the 
party of a strong and healthfull constitution. 
Cinders will not set fuell on fire 
so soone as burning coles: neither will 
greene wood be so soone kindled as chips 
and drie deale-boord. 
 
[}Profess.}] I now see and in some sort assent 
to your opinion: proceed therefore 
I pray you to giue reasons why by onely 
feare a man may be infected with the 
Plague. 
 
[}Preach.}] The spirit of a man will sustaine 
[/43./] 
his infirmities: but a wounded spirit, who 
can beare it? saith Salomon. By spirit here 
is meant a comfortable heart, which animateth 
a man in all troubles: but if 
[^p.16^] 
that fayle, hee is soone ouerthrowne. 
From the heart proceed (as Phisitions 
say) vitall spirits, whereby man is 
made actiue and couragious. If they by 
feare be inforced to retire inward, the 
outward parts be left infirme: as may 
appeare by the palenesse and trembling 
of one in great feare, so that as enemies 
easily scale the walles of a towne 
abandoned by souldiers: so the Plague 
(especially in a season disposed to infection) 
doth find readie passage into the 
outward parts of a man, destitute by 
feare of the vitall spirits which should 
[/44./] 
correct y=e= same. Againe, as faith maketh 
vs partakers of Gods helping hand, so 
[/45./] 
vnbeleefe depriueth vs thereof: & feare 
(aduersarie to faith) pulleth to the wicked 
the euill which he feareth. 
 
[}Profess.}] By this conference I haue learned 
to feare more then I haue done, and 
yet to take heed of feare: to feare because 
the plague may be caried about in garments, 
and therefore may infect me, keeping 
company with one that is co~uersant 
with the infected, I being peraduenture 
not of so strong a constitutio~ as the party. 
[^p.17^] 
To take heede of feare, lest I be guiltie of 
mine owne bane. 
 
[}Preach.}] Your collection is good, especially 
if you remember the distinction 
of feare in that sense which I haue often 
taught it: to wit, Feare is contrary 
[/46./] 
either to Security, and so it may be called 
Needfulnesse, or to Faith, and so it 
is cousin germain to Despaire. But hoping 
[/47./] 
that now you see our doctrine against 
vnruly and vncharitable going 
abroad of the infected, either in person 
or garments, not to be a checke to Pietie 
and Charitie, I pray you tell me, 
what you can say for vnnecessarie and 
desperate running to the sicke and buried 
of the Plague? 
 
[}Profess.}] What? I tell you (be it without 
offence) that many maruell (I will 
not say, cry out) that Preachers, who 
should be examples of loue and faith in 
[/48./] 
visiting the sick according to their office, 
do yet so flatly speake against the expresse 
words of Christ. For doth not he 
say: That we shall be iudged at the last 
[/49./] 
day, according to our workes of charity, 
and amongst the rest, our visiting, or not 
[^p.18^] 
visiting the sicke? 
 
[}Preach.}] O neighbour, you now lay 
on loade! I must therefore ease (a litle) 
the shoulders of Preachers whom you 
charge heauily, for not visiting the sick 
of the Plague; before I can nimbly encounter 
your maine obiection. Surely 
ye Professours, who so vrge this pretended 
dutie, are farre from the louing 
care and kindnesse of the Israelites, 
[/50./] 
who would not suffer Dauid to hazard 
himselfe in battell, lest if he, being 
woorth tenne thousand of them, were 
slaine, and the light of Israel should be 
put out. Againe, ye forget that Christ 
said to him that desired to burie his 
[/51./] 
father: Follow thou me, let the dead burie 
their dead. If ye did consider this 
well, you could not but thinke, that as 
[/52./] 
Paule said, Christ sent me not to baptize 
but to preach: so Preachers may say: 
Christ hath sent vs not to visite the 
sicke, but to preach, and thereupon co~clude; 
that the lesse dutie (if a dutie) especially 
being daungerous, must giue 
place to the greater, and the visiting of 
a few sicke and lesse capable of instruction, 
[^p.19^] 
must giue place to the teaching of 
the whole congregation, and more capable 
of doctrine and comfort. Now if 
they visite euery one that is sicke, how 
can they attend vnto reading, and follow 
[/53./] 
Christ in the most proper and necessarie 
worke of the ministerie? Lastly, 
[/54./] 
I see not (but herein I humbly submit 
mine opinion to the Church) that 
visiting the sicke is a proper dutie of a 
Minister, as he is a Minister. For as 
none can ordaine officers in the Church 
[/55./] 
but Christ, so none (as I am perswaded) 
[/56./] 
can prescribe duties to those officers, 
[/57./] 
but Christ. But I cannot find 
where Christ prescribeth visiting of the 
sicke, as a Ministers dutie. If not 
Christ, why should any surcharge Ministers, 
and the rather because they 
are not (no not the best) sufficient for 
[/58./] 
duties prescribed? Did not the Apostles 
[/59./] 
pronounce it an vnmeet thing to be 
hindred from giuing themselues continually 
to prayer, and to the ministration 
of the word, by ministring to the 
poore, and therefore put ouer that duty 
to speciall men? If the Apostles extraordinarily 
[^p.20^] 
assisted, by the Spirit, both 
with gifts and blessing, cast off an impertinent 
burthen (yea such an one as 
is no lesse necessarie then visiting.) Alas, 
why should Ministers, who neede 
all helpes (as much reading, diligent 
conference, and frequent meditation,) 
be further charged than they are by 
Christ? Indeed I confesse that a Minister 
ought (as you said) to be an example 
of all good workes, especially of that 
as being the fittest man to satisfie the 
[/60./] 
doubtfull conscience, to humble the 
stubburne heart, and to comfort the 
wounded spirit. 
 
[}Profess.}] I neuer heard this matter 
doubted of before. But (I pray you Sir) 
[/61./] 
doth not Iames say: Is any sicke among you, 
let him call for the Elders of the Church? 
Doth he not vnderstand Ministers by 
Elders? If so, doth not this place proue 
plainely, that it is a Ministers dutie to 
visite the sicke? 
 
[}Preach.}] I say not but that it is a 
Ministers dutie to visite the sicke, for 
example sake: and as he is more able to 
do good than other, but not as he is Minister. 
[^p.21^] 
I graunt also, that long since the 
same doctrine from this place hath bene 
gathered, which you now apprehend. 
So as vpon the same, Papistes haue 
grounded their bastard Sacrament of 
Extreame vnction. Which taken away, 
[/62./] 
the cursed people (which know not the 
[/63./] 
law) neither care to know it (being euer 
addicted to superstitious vanities) 
must needes (forsooth) in stead thereof, 
haue a Minister to visite their sicke, 
though they be more then halfe dead. 
As in stead of Dirgies and Trentals, 
they must haue funerall Sermons for 
fashion sake. Thus the holy Ministery, 
and most glorious name of God must 
be abused and taken in vaine, by following 
the vaine humour of arrogant 
Folly, which neuer cared for Ministers, 
or Sermons (as al ought to haue 
done) in time of health. I graunt that 
some Professors (for all this Plague, 
whereby humours (I trow) should be 
mortified) haue a mind, that funerall 
Sermons attend their credit. So stro~g 
a temptation is the Pride of life incouraged 
by Custome. But to come to the 
[^p.22^] 
point: this place of Iames doth not 
proue, y=t= it is the proper dutie of a Minister 
to visite the sicke. For the Elders 
were sent for to heale the sicke by prayer 
and oyle, according to that miraculous 
grace which was then bestowed 
[/64./] 
vpon them, for confirmation of the 
Word: so that I am of your mind, that 
teaching Elders be here vnderstood. 
Which gift discontinuing, this Canon 
is annulled: so that in time of Pestilence, 
it is absurdly concluded: that because 
Iames inioyed Ministers to go 
to heale the sicke, therefore Ministers 
must vpon euery call aduenture their 
liues, by visiting the sick of the plague. 
Againe, if it be the proper dutie of Ministers 
to visite the sicke, as it was the 
proper gift of Elders, for confirmation 
of the word, to heale with oyle, then 
none must visite the sicke but Ministers, 
[/65./] 
as none must minister the Sacraments 
[/66./] 
(which properly belong to their 
function) but they. Lastly, this word, 
Elders in the plurall number, putteth 
me in mind, that Ministers were in 
the primitiue Church, assisted with 
[^p.23^] 
other Elders, (for there were two sorts 
[/67./] 
of Elders) who looked to the manners 
[/68./] 
of people, and with Deacons who looked 
[/69./] 
to the poore, that they themselues 
might attend their studie, prayer, preaching, 
and the Sacraments. Why 
then should we thinke, that visiting 
the sicke, was laid vpon them as a dutie 
properly pertaining to their ministerie? 
But rather that Elders by spirituall 
comfort, and Deacons by outward 
reliefe visited the sicke as there 
was need: so that the Minister was 
not troubled but in extraordinarie necessitie. 
As when none but he could satisfie 
the despairefull conscience, or 
mind doubtfull in a fundamentall errour, 
of one likely (otherwise) to die 
out of the faith. In which case, I thinke 
a Minister ought to hazard his life. My 
reason is: It is the reueiled will of God 
that he must saue a lost sheepe: but it is 
[/70./] 
Gods secret, whether he shall be infected. 
And the rather because of the promise 
made to him that walketh in his 
[/71./] 
way. The premises considered touching 
ordinarie visitation, thus I conclude, 
[^p.24^] 
that as Ministers are exemplarily 
(but not as Ministers) to releeue 
the poore, according to their abilitie, 
and where they haue some speciall calling: 
so they are exemplarily (but not 
as Ministers) to visite the sicke, according 
to their leysure, and where they 
haue some speciall calling. 
 
[}Profess.}] I know not whether I should 
be glad or sad, for drawing from you 
so probable, and (it may be) a profitable 
discourse: but I will suspend my iudgement, 
sith you submit your opinion 
to the censure of the Church, and 
proceede (with your fauour) to require 
the iustifying of that vncharitable 
doctrine (so seeming) against visiting 
the sicke of the Plague, and so contrarie 
to Christ his iudgement, as hath 
[/72./] 
bene shewed. 
 
[}Preach.}] But haue you shewed 
that the plague is expressed? And haue 
you neuer heard, that there be few 
rules so generall, but they admit some 
exception? By the same iudgement prisoners 
are to be visited, and yet none 
were bound in conscience to go into the 
[^p.25^] 
dungeon there personally to visit Ieremy, 
[/73./] 
though he were the Lords prophet. 
Againe, you vtterly mistake the point: 
for the question is not whether the sick 
of the Plague are to be visited; which 
God forbid that any Preacher should 
gainesay: but whether they are to be so 
visited and with such resort, as other 
sicke of diseases not contagious. Lastly, 
in the place so much vrged, Christ doth 
not necessarily require personall visitation 
(though that also be comfortable in 
cases conuenient, and so required accordingly) 
but real, that is, by releefe, either 
brought, sent or procured: for in the 44. 
[/74./] 
verse of that chapter you may find, Ministring 
to Christ vsed, for all other 
workes of Charitie before specified. 
Whereby it is manifest, that Christ requireth 
not so much personall visiting, 
as charitable ministring to the necessitie 
of the sick. Of all other, Princes and 
Magistrates (who are foster-fathers 
and shepheards) are to visite the sicke. 
But who will say they are to do it in 
person, and not rather by a faithfull 
care, that the sicke of thr Plague be wel 
[^p.26^] 
prouided for. 
 
[}Profess.}] But how can the sicke be wel 
prouided for, if none do personally attend 
them? and if none be bound in conscience 
personally to visite, how shall they be attended? 
 
[}Preach.}] All this is true. But husbands 
and wiues, parents and childre~, 
masters and seruants, neare neighbors 
and deare friends, are mutually to attend 
each other: if otherwise conuenient 
attendance cannot be procured. 
 
[}Profess.}] Why do you adde this condition? 
 
[}Preach.}] Because life is precious: so 
[/75./] 
that we must not destroy the dam with 
[/76./] 
the yong: and therfore seeing the plague 
sweepeth where it findeth many together, 
life ought to be preserued with as 
much care as may be, by separating the 
sound from the infected, except there be 
necessary cause of the sound, or some of 
their attendance or repaire. Moreouer, 
it may be that the sound, or some of the~, 
be profitable members in the Church, 
or common wealth: now the more hope 
there is of good by them, the more care 
[^p.27^] 
there ought to be of their preseruation; 
according to the peoples care for the 
safetie of Dauid, before spoken of. 
 
[}Profess.}] In my conscience this seemes 
to be very true: but I pray you tel me what 
you think of them who send their seruants 
vnto the Pest-house. 
 
[}Preach.}] Right wel: especially if they 
want conuenient roome & other means 
at home: for I vnderstand of the Cities 
right honorable and christian prouisio~ 
for that house: I know diuers there wel 
vsed, and thence well returned: and it is 
extant in print, that when there were 
buried in and about London 3385. in 
one week, yet of all pestred in that house 
there were buried but six. And therfore 
I condemne those that raised a slander 
vpon that house, holding them as despisers 
[/77./] 
of gouernement, and wicked ill 
speakers of them that are in authoritie. 
 
[}Prof.}] If you conuersed amonst people 
as I do, and must do, I know your spirit 
would be grieued to see how ready 
they be to lay hold on euery light occasion 
and false report, to speake their wicked 
pleasure of Gouernors. O that they 
[^p.28^] 
would consider the example you lately in 
a Sermon vrged of a plague kindled amongst 
[/78./] 
the Israelites, for charging Moses 
and Aaron with killing Corah and his rebellious 
complices. Well, God amend vs 
all, and giue vs grace to humble our selues 
vnder this his heauie hand, that we may 
[/79./] 
be raised again and comforted, according 
to the dayes he hath afflicted vs. Now I 
speake of co~fort (that we may go on with 
the main matter) I wold know (if it might 
be without offence) whether you would 
haue those pittifull creatures that are torme~ted 
with the plague, to want the comfort, 
which they may take by the very presence 
of their good neighbors & friends, 
much more by their comfortable words? 
 
[}Preach.}] O neighbour! I wish them 
all true comfort of body and mind, the 
Lord knoweth, and I graunt that the 
very presence of those we loue, is very 
comfortable in time of sicknesse: but yet 
I aduise all visited with that deadly 
and contagious disease, to manifest 
their mortification from vnnecessarie 
desires, & their charitable loue to their 
friends, by not desiring them to come 
[^p.29^] 
into far greater daunger than their presence 
can do good, without necessarie 
cause. And let them remember how 
Dauid refused that water which was 
[/80./] 
gotten with ieopardie of life, and called 
it bloud, though he had longed for it, 
& the daunger was past. As for comfortable 
words, I likewise acknowledge 
their speciall vse: but before I answer 
that point, let vs consider how needfull 
it is (especially in time of mortality) to 
hide in their hearts the word of life, lest 
wee be iustly punished with want of 
comfortable words, when we most 
need them: according to that of Amos, 
where a famin of the word is threatned 
[/81./] 
to despisers of the Sabboth, and that at 
such a time, when to find the word, they 
would run from the East to the West. 
Now to the point. Sith all sicknesse (especially 
the plague, vntill the worst be 
past, when co~fortable words are not vsually 
in great request) maketh vs vnfit 
for long & learned discourses, & therfore 
short sente~ces may (through Gods blessing) 
do much good: whereby attendants 
& frie~ds, repairing for necessary causes, 
[^p.30^] 
may sufficiently comfort the afflicted, 
according to that which is required by 
the Apostle, in Thess. 4. 18. except there 
be extraordinary neede of resolution or 
consolation, whereof I haue spoken before. 
[/82./] 
Again, the Spirit of God is called 
a Comforter, because he bringeth the 
words of Christ vnto remembrance: 
and that especially in time of need, as 
[/83./] 
when we iustifie wisedome before authoritie, 
so when we are sick. For when 
[/84./] 
the outward man perisheth, the inward 
man is renewed: so that we often heare, 
not onely men but euen children also, 
speake diuinely and admirably in their 
sicknesse. We may the rather make account 
of this holy assistance, if we follow 
Christ his counsel in laying vp his 
[/85./] 
words in our hearts, and praying for 
the holy Ghost. All the premises considered, 
I hope that you are now of my 
mind, touching the restraint, as of the 
infected from the sound, so of the sound 
from the infected. 
 
[}Profess.}] Indeede I confesse that your 
probable discourses haue won (I know 
not how) a certaine inclination to your 
[^p.31^] 
opinion, but yet I must suspend my resolution, 
till you haue answered certain obiections 
against the maine grounds of 
your opinion: but before I come to them, 
let me haue but one word with you about 
buriall. I say but one word: for if those 
that are infected in person or garment, 
are to keep from Church for a time conuenient: 
and if friends are to forbeare resorting 
to friends sicke of the Plague, except 
they haue necessary cause, then I may 
(of my selfe) conclude, that we are not to 
throng after infected corpses (which haue 
no good thereby) without some reasonable 
cause. That one word (I spake of) is 
this, I would gladly know (if I may obtaine 
that fauour) your iudgement, concerning 
the direction of authoritie, that 
but sixe persons, besides the Minister, 
Clerke and bearers, should accompany 
infected corpses. 
 
[}Preach.}] I dare not presume to iudge 
of the determinations of authoritie 
without sufficie~t reason, which I want 
in this case: but rather I am perswaded 
(according to that I am commaunded 
by these words, Honor thy father and mother) 
[/86./] 
[^p.32^] 
to indge the best, and take it as an 
argument, that authoritie careth more 
for the liuing then for the dead, their 
pompe so dangerous in these times and 
not necessary, as wise men thinke. But 
mine own opinion is this I could wish 
y=t= friends of the diseased would respect 
the preseruation of life more than complements 
of buriall. But I vtterly mislike 
that infected persons should thrust 
into the throng, and it grieueth me to 
heare how the poorer sort, yea women 
with yong children, will flocke to burials, 
and (which is worse) stand (of purpose) 
ouer open graues, where sundry 
are buried together, that (forsooth) all 
the world may see that they feare not 
the Plague. This peruerse course of too 
too many, in doing that which authority 
forbiddeth, and despising that which 
authoritie commandeth, to wit, fasting 
and praier, occasioneth me to obserue a 
notable proportion betweene y=e= plague 
& the wickednes of this time: by which 
proportion, God seemeth to teach men 
to say in their hearts, we would not be 
ruled, neither by reason nor authority, 
[^p.33^] 
therefore are so many, as it were distracted 
in their sicknesse, and by no 
meanes to be ruled: so that some leape 
out of the windowes, and some runne 
into y=e= Thames. As the rough speeches 
of Ioseph caused his brethren to say: As 
[/87./] 
we would not heare Ioseph, so this man 
will not heare vs. I rather obserue this 
proportion betweene the vnrulinesse of 
our sinne, and the vnrulinesse of this 
sicknesse, because I find in the Scriptures, 
that the Plague was especially 
threatened against, and inflicted vpon 
wilfull offendors. At your leysure consider 
these places. Leuit. 26. 23, 24, 25. 
Num. 14. 37. and 16. 41, 45, 46. 2. Sam. 
24. 1, 2, 3, 4, 15. and you will perceiue 
as much. But now let me heare one of 
your obiections against the grounds of 
mine opinion. 
 
[}Prof.}] The ground whereon you build 
your opinion, of separating the sound 
from the infected, is the law of Lepers. 
Which (vnder your correction) seemeth 
to be no rocke, but a sand, because that 
law was meerely ceremoniall. 
 
[}Prea.}] Nay Sir, my ground is the 
[^p.34^] 
mortall contagion of the Pestilence, 
which we call the Plague. Indeed I receiue 
confirmation from the law of Lepers. 
For thus I reason: If such care 
is to be had of infection which is not 
mortall, much more of y=e= Plagues infection 
which is mortall. And this argument 
holdeth good, your obiection notwithstanding. 
For the lawes of separating 
[/88./] 
women in time of their flowers, 
and not eating strangled beasts, were 
ceremoniall: but yet husbands are 
now to forbeare the act of matrimonie 
in that time, and all are to take heede 
how they eate of strangled flesh, and 
both are to be heeded in naturall consideration 
of bodily hurt, which is still 
to be feared, in such copulation and eating. 
So Leprosie is still infectiue, as 
experience sheweth: if now, why not 
then, notwithstanding the lawe of Lepers 
was ceremoniall? And the rather 
because in Sacraments and ceremonies, 
there must be a resemblauce betweene 
the signe and the thing signified: 
so that, as we obiect against Transsubstantiation, 
and say: If the substance 
[^p.35^] 
of bread and wine be taken away 
by consecration, how can there be 
bodily nourishment? if no nourishment, 
how can our spirituall feeding be 
resembled? So I say to you, If in the 
Leprosie there were no infection, how 
could the contagion of sinne be signified? 
 
[}Prof.}] I graunt that in Leprosie there 
was somewhat to signifie a sinne to be 
shunned. But that was Pollution, not Infection. 
For vpon occasion of this question. 
I haue read both the Chapters co~cerning 
[/89./] 
Leprosie, and find them still 
mention Vncleanenesse, and neuer Infection. 
Againe, if the Leprosie were infectiue, 
how chaunced it that the Priestes, 
who so often viewed the Lepers, were 
neuer infected? 
 
[}Preach.}] Do not you consider, that 
though all vncleanenesse be not infectiue, 
yet all infection is vncleane, and 
therefore you might haue vnderstood 
Infection as well as any other Pollution, 
by the word Uncleanenesse. And 
though you find not the very word Infection, 
yet you may find enough to 
[^p.36^] 
make it euident, that the Leprosie is 
[/90./] 
infectiue. For it was not to be pronounced 
Leprosie, except it were found 
spreading and fretting as a Canker, or 
[/91./] 
Gangrene in a mans bodie. And why 
was the Leper to couer his lips, and to 
[/92./] 
to cry, I am vncleane, I am vncleane, but 
to giue warning, that none shold come 
within the infection of his breath? As 
for the Priestes escape, that is to be attributed 
to the prouidence of God, who 
set him on worke. As he promised to 
[/93./] 
preserue Ieremy and Paule for that 
[/94./] 
cause. 
 
[}Prof.}] If my memorie faile me not, I 
haue heard you say, that the ceassing of 
[/95./] 
Man, presently after the children of Israel 
had eaten of the corne of the land of 
promise, teacheth vs not to depend vpon 
extraordinarie meanes (viz. Miracles and 
such like) when we may enioy ordinarie. 
So I thinke it may be said, we are not to 
suppose the extraordinarie prouidence 
of God, in preseruing Priests viewing 
the Lepers, where we may find and ordinarie, 
to wit, their not touching of Lepers, 
whereby they might be defiled. 
 
[^p.37^] 
[}Preach.}] How find you that to be the 
cause? Sith you find not in both your 
Chapters Touching spoken of. Whereas 
in the next Chapter you find Pollution 
[/96./] 
communicated by touching and 
not otherwise in the vncleannesse of a 
man by fluxe of seed, and of a woman 
by issue of flowers. Nay in this case of 
of Leprosie, a man is become vncleane, 
[/97./] 
by going into an house shut vp for Leprosie 
in the wals, which he need not 
to touch, as hath bene said. So that if 
[/98./] 
you consider your two Chapters well, 
it may rather appeare to you, that as 
the infection of the Plague, so of the 
Leprosie was communicated by the 
ayre, and not onely by touching. But 
suppose that Pollution not Infection, 
were the cause that cleane men should 
shunne vncleane Lepers, lest they 
should be defiled, not infected; yet this 
makes for my purpose. For if Pollution 
be to be shunned, much more Infection, 
and that deadly. 
 
[}Profess.}] I see I must either depart not 
fully satisfied, or come to a point which 
I haue hitherto auoyded, because I wold 
[^p.38^] 
not offend you, whom I haue heard so 
earnest against it, so as you haue pronounced 
it to be a bloudie errour, to wit, 
It is stiffely maintained by no small number 
of people, that the Plague is not contagious. 
 
[}Preach.}] I graunt that mo than a 
good many do more stiffely than wisely 
maintaine that bloudie error, so I will 
call it againe and againe. For most of 
that many do wilfully maintaine that 
opinion, because they cannot abide to 
be Gods prisoners. It is a death to be 
out of companie, and they had rather 
indanger a thousand liues, than want 
any part of their pleasure or profite. As 
may appeare by the discouered course 
of many, who hold the Plague to be 
infectiue, while they and theirs be wel: 
but when they or theirs be infected; the~ 
(forsooth) the Plague is not infectiue. 
So their reason followeth and is framed 
to their will, and not their will 
followeth reason to be ruled thereby. 
But me thinkes euery reasonable man 
should say to his owne soule: O let me 
be sure mine opinion touching the infection 
[^p.39^] 
of the Plague (whether negatiue 
or affirmatiue) be vndoubtedly 
true, lest by maintaining an error, in a 
case and time of so great mortalitie and 
vnspeakeable miseries, I do infinite 
hurt. For if it be true that the Plague 
is contagious, then of necessitie, he 
that maintaineth the contrarie, is guiltie 
of the bloud of so many, as are incouraged 
by his opinion to runne into 
daunger. On the other side, if the 
Plague be not contagious, then he 
that maintaineth the contrarie, is guiltie 
of all the wants and miseries of so 
many as want conuenient reliefe, not 
ministred for feare of contagion, apprehended 
by the maintenance of his opinion. 
But neighbour, I wonder that 
any should deny the Plague to be contagious 
against so generall and wofull 
experience. Do not the botches, blains 
and spots (called Gods tokens) accompanied 
with rauing and death, argue 
a straunger infection, then that of the 
Leprosie, to be iudged by botches and 
spots? Doth not the ordinarie experience 
of laying liue Pigeons to plague 
[^p.40^] 
sores, and taking them presently dead 
away, and that one after another, demonstrate 
mortall infection? In that 
the Plague rageth and raigneth especially 
amongst the younger sort, and 
such as do not greatly regard cleane 
and sweete keeping, and where many 
are pestred together in alleyes or houses: 
is not this an argument of infection? 
Thousandes can directly tell, 
where, when, and of whom they tooke 
the Plague. Doth not all this make it 
more then manifest, that the Plague 
is contagious? All Magistrates, all 
Diuines, all Phisitians, all learned 
men, and all wise men, in all ages, 
haue held the Plague to be contagious. 
Dare any but blind bayard, be so impudent 
to deny it, without such reasons, 
as may sway against so great experience, 
and so great authoritie? If 
you haue any such, I pray you let me 
heare them. 
 
[}Profess.}] That I haue any such I cannot 
say, in regard of the weaknes of my iudgment, 
as also of the probabilitie (at least) 
of that I haue heard already spoken to the 
[^p.41^] 
contrary: but such as they be (if it please 
you) I will bring them out, humbly desiring 
your answers. The first, is thus vrged 
with open mouth: This opinion of infection 
doeth vtterly ouerthrow charitie towards 
the visited by the plague, being the 
cause, why they by whose meanes the sick 
and sound are especially to be prouided 
for, do runne away, viz. Magistrates, Ministers, 
(such I meane as indeed were neuer 
faithful, for (blessed be God) many 
faithful remaine) Phisitians and rich men: 
and why so many be thrust out of doores, 
perish in town and field for want of help, 
and are so cruelly vsed by country people: 
so that it is a very countermaund to Christ 
his iudgement concerning visitation of 
the sicke. But by that which hath bin said, 
[/99./] 
and by gathering from the last point we 
talked of, that the precise commaundement 
[/100./] 
touching Lepers to be separated 
from Church and companie, was no hinderance 
to their visitation, but that they 
were to be ministred vnto, according to 
their need: I am for my part induced to 
lay the blame of all this vncharitable dealing 
vpon the excessiue feare of people, 
[^p.42^] 
occasioned perhaps, but not well grounded 
vpon the opinion of the Plagues infection: 
for though the Plague be to be 
feared, because of the infection, yet (as I 
take it) not so excessiuely and inordinatly. 
For of such feare, the cause is want of 
faith, rather then the opinion of infection; 
as I may partly gather from that which 
[/101./] 
you deliuered before: I will therfore propound 
an argument (so deemed) which 
we haue not yet handled. 
 
[}Preach.}] Stay here a while, for I can 
not but thanke God that you iudge so 
rightly betweene mine opinion, and 
others feare of infection. If Professors 
would wisely obserue what is taught, 
there would not be so many spiders to 
suck ranke poison out of sound doctrine. 
Then might we hold the plague in the 
nature thereof to be contagious, and 
men would not take occasion before it 
be giuen, of excessiue and inordinate 
feare: then might we inuey against excessiue 
and inordinate feare, and men 
would not take occasion before it be giuen, 
of inordinate and dangerous presumption: 
but foolish men (as wise men 
[^p.43^] 
obserue) are euer running into extremities. 
If Paul teach, that we are iustified 
[/102./] 
by faith, without the works of the law; 
the carnal gospeller taketh occasion before 
it be giuen, to neglect good workes. 
And if Iames teach, that faith without 
[/103./] 
workes is dead, the arrogant Papist 
taketh occasion before it be giuen, to aduance 
good workes to merite and supererogation. 
Mine heart bleedeth to heare 
of the crueltie and inhumanitie you 
mentioned: so that if I were in the cuntrey, 
I would (by Gods grace) set my 
selfe against those damnable effects of 
inordinate feare, and make it euident 
that the Plague is not so contagious 
as excessiue feare makes it to be. But 
now I follow this course (which God 
blesse) because I liue where the contrarie 
sinne of Presumption is more generall, 
and more dangerous; both because 
of that bloudy errour, as also of the absence 
of Magistrates, who should see 
good orders put in execution: through 
which default it is come to passe, that 
men, women and children with running 
sores, go commonly abroade, and 
[^p.44^] 
thrust themselues into company, so that 
some haue perceiued when they tooke 
the infection of such. How many may 
be supposed to haue taken the infection 
from such, though they perceiued it not? 
I would be loth to make Magistrates 
neglecting their charge, guiltie of all 
this bloud: but (if I were in place) I 
would humbly and earnestly intreate 
them, seriously to consider the nine first 
verses of the 21. of Deuteronomy, where 
they may learne, how fearefull they (of 
all other) should be of bloud-guiltines. 
But leauing them to Gods direction, I 
pray you propound your argument so 
deemed. 
 
[}Profess.}] That I will, and (as neare as I 
can) in such sort as it is inforced. If the 
Plague be contagious, why is not one infected 
as well as another? I haue lyen in 
bed with many that haue had the plague-sores 
running on them, I haue bene still 
about them, when they swet, their sores 
brake, and breath went out of their bodies, 
and yet I (and a great number besides 
me, who haue done as much) had neuer 
the plague yet, and trust neuer shal, so long 
[^p.45^] 
as I haue a strong faith in God: for is it 
not written, Thou shalt not be afraid of the 
[/104./] 
pestilence, for thousands shal fal besides thee, 
yet it shall not come neare thee; for thou hast 
said, The Lord is my hope. 
 
[}Preacher.}] This aduenturous argument 
standeth vpo~ two point, viz. first 
the escaping of some, and secondly their 
strong faith. Concerning the former, I 
answer, (in the name of the opponent) 
[/105./] 
Is thine eye euill because God is good? Wilt 
thou by thy bloody errour poison other, 
because God hath glorified his speciall 
prouidence ouer thee? Is this thy thankfulnesse 
for so great deliuerance, to obscure 
Gods prouidence by attributing 
thine escape to this, that the plague is 
not infectiue? Consider better the very 
text alleaged for thy strong faith, and 
you may (if you will) see clearely, that 
God doth hereby set forth his prouidence, 
in that he preserueth those that 
trust in him, and walke in his wayes, 
by Angels, and then, when by the pestilence, 
thousands fall about them: for 
the greater the daunger is, the greater 
is Gods prouidence in deliuering his 
[^p.46^] 
people, as may further appeare by their 
[/106./] 
walking vpon Lions, Aspes, and Dragons, 
mentioned in the same Psalme. 
Therefore take heede how you obscure 
the prouidence of God, and draw many 
into daunger by denying the plague to 
be contagious; lest as he that feared 
[/107./] 
not the day of the Lord, met with a 
Beare when he had escaped a Lion: so 
you meete with a iudgement heauier to 
you, though you still escape the plague. 
But neighbour, I will turne my speech 
to you, praying you to consider this 
Psalme wel, and you shall see me proue 
from the same the Plague to be contagious. 
For if an extraordinary prouidence 
of God be manifested in preseruing 
those that beleeue from pestilence, 
then is the pestilence very dangerous: 
as be the Lion, Aspe and Dragon, but 
the former is true, therefore the latter. 
If then the pestilence be dangerous to 
one that is the middest of thousands 
dying thereof, it must needes be so by 
contagion: as may further appeare, in 
that it is called noisome; and in that it 
[/108./] 
is said, it shall not come neare thee. But let 
[^p.47^] 
vs trie the strength of the former part 
of that huge argument, layed downe in 
this forme. Many haue bene with the 
sicke of the plague, when they swet, &c. 
& yet are not infected, therefore it is not 
contagious. Certaine Priests said to 
a Philosopher, All these monuments 
which you see in this Temple, be in remembrance 
of so many deliuered from 
shipwracke, by prayer to the God of 
this Temple. But (quoth the Philosopher) 
can you shew me how many 
prayed, and yet perished? As the Philosophers 
answer was stronger against 
their God, then the Priests obseruation 
was for their God: so it maketh much 
more to proue the plague to be contagious, 
to say: an hundred (if not a thousand) 
infected by being where the 
plague is, may be brought for one that 
escaped. Againe, if that argument be 
good, then these be as good: Many haue 
had the plague sores and were sick, and 
yet died not; therefore the plague is not 
in it owne nature mortall. Many run 
vpon the mouth of a canon, and escape, 
therfore canon shot is not murthering. 
[^p.48^] 
Profess. We see the canon shot to kil, 
but we see not the Plague to infect. 
 
[}Preach.}] By common experience it is 
obserued, that souring of drinke, and 
other effects follow thunder, wherunto 
they are attributed: and children take 
the small pockes comming where they 
be: though it be not seene how thunder 
and being where small pocks are, cause 
such effects. Why then should we not 
feare aswell the pestilence that walketh 
in darknes, as the plague that destroyeth 
at noone day: sith by common experience 
it is obserued, that thousands 
fall sicke of the plague presently vpon 
their being where it is, though it be not 
seene how y=e= infectio~ is conueyed. Truly 
the commo~ people herein do litle differ 
from brute beasts: in that (for the most 
part) they are moued by sense, and not 
by reason. 
 
[}Prof.}] I feare it is so in too many: for going 
amongst the~, I hardly perceiue one of 
ten once looke for help, though they haue 
a rising of the plague in some part of their 
body vntil they be heart sick, & then often 
they seeke for help too late. Whereas if in 
[^p.49^] 
reaso~ they wold co~sider, that as the plague 
may be some good time in the garme~t, before 
it infect the outward parts, so it may 
be in the flesh a good while, before it 
strike the very heart, no doubt they wold 
betime preuent the worst. Through 
which default I am perswaded hundreds 
do perish daily: but commending such to 
Gods gracious prouidence. I pray you 
tell me what causes are giuen by the learned, 
why so many escape, though they 
be continually in so great daunger of the 
Plague, as hath bene said. 
[/109./] 
 
[}Preach.}] There be causes both naturall 
and diuine. For naturall causes 
I referre you to learned Phisitians. 
Onely I will shew you somewhat, 
which euery reasonable man (as I 
thinke) may conceiue. Before any qualitie, 
good or bad, can qualifie any subiect, 
the subiect must be first disposed 
thereunto, or capable thereof. The Salamander 
liueth in the fire, though the 
flie, playing with the flame of a candle 
is consumed therewith. Gun powder 
takes fire presently, but so doth not 
chalke. So persons of a tender constitution, 
[^p.50^] 
or corrupt humours sooner take 
the Plague, then those that be of a 
strong constitution, & sound bodies, as 
[/110./] 
hath bene said: & some infected are much 
fuller of poisonfull corruption then other. 
The infirmities of many women 
in trauell, and other diseases turne vnto 
the Plague. We see few auncient 
people die in comparison of children, 
and the younger sort. Lastly of those 
that keepe a good diet, haue cleane and 
sweet keeping, liue in a good aire, vse 
reasonable and seasonable preseruatiues, 
and be not pestred many in one 
house, or haue conuenient house-roome 
for their houshold, we see few infected 
in comparison of those, that faile in all 
these good meanes of preseruation, and 
yet will thrust themselues into danger. 
This well considered, may not an argument 
be drawn from hence, to proue 
(euen by reason) that the Plague is not 
so infectiue as faithlesse people conceiue, 
and therefore they need not feare 
the Plague so extreamely as they do? 
But I will proceed to the diuine causes 
or reasons. The chiefe whereof is this: 
[^p.51^] 
God worketh al things after the counsell 
[/111./] 
of his owne will, and therefore he 
[/112./] 
hath mercie on whome he will haue 
mercie, and none shall die but they who 
[/113./] 
are appointed. For though the Pharisies 
[/114./] 
sought to lay hands on Christ, yet 
they could not, before the appointed 
time came: and therefore be y=t= Plague 
neuer so contagious in it owne nature, 
none can be smitten with it, but those, 
whom God hath specially appointed. 
 
[}Profess.}] Here I remember an opinion 
of some people (with whom I conuerse) 
whereby they seeme to the~selues, 
to reconcile the difference, touching the 
Plagues infection; and that is this. Let 
one (say they) go neuer so daungerously 
where the Plague is, he cannot die before 
his time, and yet indeed he may take 
the sicknesse. What thinke you of this 
opinion? 
 
[}Preach.}] What thinke I of it? as I 
do of other opinions which brain-sicke 
men (despising the word of God, and 
ministerie thereof do forge in their 
owne phantasticall braine-pans. How 
wittie soeuer it seeme to them, I tel you 
[^p.52^] 
it sauoureth strongly of Epicurisme. 
For doth God dispose of capitall and 
principall, and not of lesse matters, as 
Epicures dreame? Shall we say: The 
[/115./] 
issues of death belong to the Lord, and 
shall we doubt with the Philistims, 
[/116./] 
whether sicknesse be by chaunce? If 
they knew the Scriptures they might 
[/117./] 
learne, that God forgetteth not sparrowes, 
[/118./] 
but so regardeth them, that 
without him, not one of them falleth 
to the ground. Doubtlesse Gods prouidence 
is the same, though not alike 
manifest, in litle and great matters. 
 
[}Profess.}] The more I conferre with 
you, the more I perceiue (I thank God 
for it) the presumptuous wit of foolish 
men, and herein I see euidently, that they 
measure the infinite prouidence of God, 
by the shallownesse of their owne capacitie. 
The Lord graunt vs grace to vnderstand 
[/119./] 
according to sobrietie. I haue another 
argument against the opinion of infection 
from the prouidence of God, but 
I would first heare some mo causes or 
reasons, why so many escape so great 
danger of infection. 
 
[^p.53^] 
[}Preach.}] Neighbour you still harpe 
vpon, so many, so many. I tell you they 
be few or none in comparison of them, 
who daily are infected by being within 
daunger of the Plague. As for your desire 
to heare mo causes, I am content 
to satisfie the same. But I must first tel 
you, that he is happy who can know 
the causes of things, to the end you 
may content your selfe with those few 
I can presently gather out of the word. 
God preserueth some to manifest his 
power and prouidence. As may appeare 
by the 91. Psalme before discussed: 
[/120./] 
and by Esa. 1. 9. (2) God will take 
none hence before they haue done him 
all that seruice, which in his counsell 
was appointed, as appeareth by these 
places, Luk. 13. 31, 32, 33, and Act. 13. 
36. (3) God reserueth some for an heauier 
iudgement, as may appeare by 
these places: I. King. 19. 17. 2. King. 8. 
10, 15. Amos 5. 16, 17. And 4, towards 
some he perfourmeth his promise in 
preseruing them, in their wayes: that 
is, wayes whereinto God calleth the~: 
according to the 91. Psalme, vers. 11. 
[^p.54^] 
For which cause Priests, though taking 
often view of Leprosie, were preserued, 
as I shewed before, and keepers, 
[/121./] 
buriers, and such as haue necessarie 
cause of comming to the infected of 
the Plague, are (for the most part) now 
preserued. So that Peter may boldly go 
on the water when Christ biddeth him 
come. As you may reade, Mat. 14. 28, 29.
