THough these Observations have been abroad these several 
years, yet coming but lately to our view, we could 
take no sooner notice of them. Divers are not inconsiderable; 
e. g. Of a Pleurisy, ending in an Abscess in the Thigh: Of 
an Abscess in the Thigh evacuated by Vrine: Of a great clew 
of wormes voided by crude Mercury taken inwardly: Of a Pleurisy 
cured without Blood-letting: Of the Bones of a fætus drawn 
out of the Mothers belly, she surviving and bearing several children 
afterwards: Of the opening of an Vterus closed from the 
birth: Of a bigg Stone found in the Emulgent veins of a Boy 
of 9. years old: of a Pin swallow'd and breaking out of the 
Thigh 4. years after: Of a Nose cut off by the hand of 
Justice, and happily set and healed on again, by receiving it, 
when it fell off, into a warm loaf of bread cut in the middle, 
and so sowing it on: Of a Hen, bringing forth 5 well-formed 
and live chickins immediately out of her belly, which kill'd 
her: Of an odd heat in the extreamest parts of the body, whilst 
the intetmediat ones betwixt them and the heart were very cold: 
Of a Quartan cured by drinking very new Beer, and sweating 
largely upon it: Of an Eye taken out of the Head of a living 
man, which being examin'd had all its humors converted into 
a tallowy matter: Of strange Convulsion-fits, accompanied 
with vomitings of odd matter, happily cured: Of an unusual ease 
of Melancholy, in which the Patient abhorred most kinds of 
me_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]t, drink, vessels, and almost all people, fancying them to 
[^p.1019^] 
have toucht or been toucht by Epileptical persons: Of a Stone 
generated in the Tongue: &c. 
 
Having inquired of an observing Correspondent, living in 
the Country, Whether he had met with any such Instances as 
was mentioned above, of a Viviparous Hen, he returned this 
Answer, that at Wackton in Norfolk, 2. or 3. years since, 
there was a Hen, which bigg with Eggs, upon some account 
could not lay, but after a time dyed; and then being opened, 
there was found in the Ovarium a perfect chick, which was 
offered to a Physitian in those parts to preserve.
