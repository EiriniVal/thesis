[}The Relation it self of that pretended Discovery,

as it is to be found in the Journal des 
Scavans, of Feb. 8. 1672.}] 
 
THE Discovery made about twenty 
years since by M. Pecquet of the Ductus 
Thoracicus, seemed not sufficient to clear 
up all the Difficulties to be met with in the 
New opinion, which this Channel hath 
occasion'd, concerning Sanguification. 
 
It might be said among other things, 
That there appears no reason, why Nature, 
which does nothing without design, 
should carry the matter of the Blood into 
the Sub-clavials, and thence make it 
descend by the Trunck of the Vena Cava, 
[/2./] unless it be to keep the Chyle from 
entring all at once and altogether pure 
into the Heart, and that the mixture, 
which is made of the Chyle with the Blood 
along this way, may dispose the Chyle, 
by a kind of contagious fermentation the 
[^p.5008^] 
more easily to receive the character of the 
Blood in the Heart: But that this might 
be more conveniently done, the Ductus 
Thoracicus being inserted into that trunck 
of the Vena cava which ascends to the 
Heart, because that this way is shorter, 
and is equally favourable to this commixture. 
 
It might also be objected, that, supposing 
this commixture were of importance, the 
Ductus Thoracicus should communicate 
with the inferior trunck of the vena cava as 
well as with the superior, to the end that the 
moiety of the Chyle being mixt with the 
blood that comes from on high, and the 
other moiety with the blood that comes 
from beneath, (B) [/3./] it might the more easily 
be altered by this commixture. And 
this Objection seemed the more rational, 
because, it being very likely that the 
Blood, which returns from the parts in 
which it hath received some impression 
in penetrating their porosities, communicates 
to the Chyle these same dispositions; 
there was reason to desire, that the 
Blood which re-ascends might in some degree 
impress the peculiar character of the 
inferior parts, as that, which comes from 
the upper parts, impresses upon it that 
which belongs to it. 
 
(C.) [/4./] Add hereunto, that the Blood 
which re-ascends to the Heart, must be 
more perfect than that which descends; 
because it comes from being purified in 
the Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys; so that 
it is capable to give (D.) [/5./] to the Chyle 
good impressions. 
 
(E.) [/6./] Lastly, it might be said, that, supposing 
it be necessary that not only a portion 
of the Chyle pass through the Heart, 
to give it some kind of refreshment, but 
also that all the Chyle be conveyed thither 
for to be converted into Blood; 
the small orifices, which the ductus thoracicus 
hath in the subclavials, seem not to 
[^p.5009^] 
be large enough for that purpose. 
 
(F.) [/7./] The Observations, that have been 
made in the beginning of this year in his 
Majesties Library, by searching carefully 
the passage of the Ductus Thoracicus in the 
Body of a Woman, did shew, that these 
difficulties were well grounded. For, it 
hath been found by divers Experiments, 
made about this matter, that there ascends 
at least so much Chyle through the 
Trunck which is beneath the Heart, as 
there descends through that which is above 
it. 
 
These Experiments have appeared considerable, 
in regard that they confirm 
those, which were also made by the same 
Royal Academy of the Sciences about five 
years since, and which were inserted in 
the 7th Journal des Scavans 1667. [/8./] But 
this last Experiment 
hath been clearer and 
ampler then the first, 
in that the Communication, 
which the first 
time appeared to be only with the left 
Emulgent vein, hath been found this second 
time not only with this vein, but 
also with the two Lumbary veins, which 
are inserted in the Trunck of the inferior 
vena cava. 
 
As to the manner of proceeding, in the 
presence of the whole Company, for 
finding this Communication, it was this: 
After there had been shewed the Commerce 
of the Ductus thoracicus with the 
Right Ventricle of the Heart by an injection 
of Milk, which having been syringed 
into the beginning of this Channel, 
issued in great quantity through this ventricle; 
we tyed the Trunck of the vena 
cava above the Heart, so that nothing 
might pass that way; and the Trunck of 
the Emulgent and that of the Vena Cava having 
been opened above long wise, some 
milk, ready to boyl, was (G.) [/9./] injected 
[^p.5010^] 
into the Emulgent through the left Lumbary 
vein (which we have ever observed to 
come from the Emulgent,) and at the same 
time we saw it come away through the other 
Lumbary. 
 
This Experiment having been several 
times repeated without our being able to 
see the track, which we had observed under 
the Pleura, when the first Discovery 
of this Communication was made; which 
track seemed to shew the way, which the 
Thoracick branch keeps to entertain a 
communication with the inferior vena cava: 
We resolved to attempt a more easie and a 
more certain method of discovering this 
branch, than the usual dissection of the 
vessels, performed by severing their proper 
tunicles from a multitude of membranes 
and fatnesses, which lying and embarassing 
them, render this work very difficult; 
especially when the vessels are not 
filled with blood to make them visible, and 
because they are composed of more delicate 
tunicles, than those of the Veins. 
 
(H.) [/10./] This way was, to syringe into the 
Trunck of the ductus thoracicus a Composition, 
that might run into it being hot, and 
which by being refrigerated might become 
solid enough to afford a greater facility to 
follow and trace the channels, in the cavity 
of which it should be thus hardened. 
And this design succeeded in part. For, 
the Composition filled the whole ductus 
thoracicus and ascended as far as into the 
sub-clavial; but there passed nothing into 
the channel that makes the communication 
sought for, though care was had to 
warm the ambient parts by several injections 
of warm milk, to the end that the 
Composition might not harden before it 
had penetrated into all the conduits. We 
also tryed to inject the same Composition 
through the Lumbary that issues out of the 
Trunck, if its valves would permit it; 
but they stopped all that we endeavoured 
[^p.5011^] 
to make pass that way, and neither the 
milk nor the wind would ever enter there. 
 
(J.) [/11./] The advantage we had from the 
Injection of this Composition into the 
said Ductus, was, that we very distinctly 
saw the figure and the whole structure of 
it, when the Composition wherewith it had 
been filled, was refrigerated and hardned. 
For we found, that that ductus did ascend 
unto the right side of the heart, keeping 
one and the same size, which was no 
more than 1/12 of an inch; that afterwards 
it was enlarged to 1/6 of an inch in 
diameter; that in this enlargement its 
tunicle on the right side of the vertebræ 
was, as 'twere, pierced by four small 
holes, distant 1/12 of an inch from one another, 
and all disposed in a row; into 
which holes the said Composition had not 
been able to penetrate; that the same 
ductus, after having retaken its first size, 
had two appendixes fashioned like sacks; 
that there was yet a third appendix beneath 
the dilatation; that the first and highest 
appendix was of the form and bigness of a 
small phaseolus; that the third, which 
was beneath the dilatation, was like to the 
second; that they had all a streight orifice; 
and that the last was full of chyle conspissate, 
so that the Composition could not 
enter there, as it had done into the other. 
 
The Importance of these Observations 
ought to incite the Curiosity of those that 
are addicted to Anatomical researches, 
and to engage them to examin with care 
this New communication, to attain at last 
a clear accompt thereof.
