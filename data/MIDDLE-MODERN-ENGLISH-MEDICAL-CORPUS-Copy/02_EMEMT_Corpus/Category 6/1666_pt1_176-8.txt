[}II. Nicolai Stenonis de Musculis & Glandulis Observationum specimen; 
cum duabus Epistolis Anatomicis.}] In the specimen it self, the Author, 
having described in general, both the Structure and the Function 
of the Muscles, applies that description to the Heart, to demonstrate 
that that is also a true Muscle: Observing first, that in the substance of 
the Heart there appears nothing but Arteries, Veins, Nerves, Fibres, 
Membrans; and that that, & nothing else is found in a Muscle; affirming 
withall, that which is commonly taught of the Muscles, and 
particularly of the Heart's Parenchyma, as distinct from Fibres, is 
due, not to the Senses, but the Wit of Anatomists: so that he will not 
have the Heart made up of a substance peculiar to it self, nor considered 
as the principle of Innate heat, or of Sanguification, or of vital 
spirits. He observes next, that the Heart performs the like operation 
with the Muscles, to wit, to contract the Flesh; which action 
how it can have a different cause from that of the Contraction 
made in the Muscles, where there is so great a parity and agreement 
in the Vessels, he sees not. And as for the Phænomena, that 
occur, of the Motion of the Heart, he undertakes to explicate them 
all, from the Ductus or Position of the Fibres; but refers for the performance 
of this undertaking to another Treatise, he intends to 
publish. 
 
As to his Observations abous Glanduls, he affirms, that he has 
been the First, that has discover'd that Vessel, which by him is call'd 
[^p.177^] 
Salivare Exterius, passing from the Parotides (or the two chief Arteries that 
are on the right and left side neer the Throat) into the Mouth, and conveying the 
Spittle: Where he also gives an account of several other Vessels and Glanduls, 
some about the Lips; others under the Tongue; others in the Pallate &c. To 
which he adds the Vessels of the Eye-lids, which have their root in the Glanduls 
that are about the Eyes, and serve for the shedding of Tears. He mentions also several things about the Lymphatick vessels, and is of opinion, that the knowledge 
thereof may be much illustrated by that kind of Glanduls that are called Conglobatæ, 
and by their true insertion into the 
[/1./] 
veins; the mistake of the latter whereof, 
he conceives to have very much misled 
the Noble Ludovicus de Bills, notwithstanding 
his excellent method of dissection. 
And here he observes first, that all the 
Lymphatick vessels have such a commerce 
with the Glanduls, that none of them is 
found in the body, which either has not its 
origine from, or is inserted into a Glandule: 
And then, that Glanduls are a kind 
of Strainers, so form'd, that whilst the Blood passes out of the Arteries into the 
Veins through the small Capillary vessels, the Serous parts thereof, being freed 
from the Sanguineous, are by vertue of the heat expell'd through fit pores into 
the Capilaries of the Lymphaticks; the direction of the Nerves concurring. 
 
Of the two annex'd Epistles the First gives an account of the dissection of two 
Raja's or Skates, and relates that the Author found in the bellies of these Fishes 
a Haddock of 1 1/2 span long, and a Sole, a Plaise and nine middle-sized Sea-crafishes; 
whereof not only the three former had their flesh, in the fishes stomack, turn'd 
into a fluid, and the Gristles or Bones into a soft substance, but the Crafishes had 
their shels comminuted into very small particles, tinging here and there the Chyle 
near the Pylorus; which he judges to be done not so much by the heat of the Fishes stomack, as by the help of some digesting juyce. Coming to the Uterus of 
these Fishes, he takes occasion to examine, with what ground several famous Naturalists 
and Anatomists have affirm'd, that Eggs are the uterus exposed or ejected 
out of the body of the Animal. Taking a view of their Heart, he there finds but 
one ventricle, and discourses of the difficulty arising from thence. As for the Lungs, 
he saw no clearer footsteps of them in these, than he had done in other Fishes: 
but within the mouth he trac'd several gaping fissures, and found the recesses of 
the Gills so form'd, that the water taken in at the mouth, being let out by these 
dores, cannot by them re-enter, by reason of a skin outwardly passing over every 
hole, and covering it. Where he intimates, that though Fishes have not true Lungs, 
yet they want not a Succedaneum thereto, to wit, the Gills; and if water may be 
to Fishes, what Air is to terrestrial Animals, for Respiration: asserting, that 
whereas nothing is so necessary for the conservation of Animal life as a reciprocal Access and Recess of the Ambient to the sanguineous vessels, tis all one, whether 
that be done by receiving the Ambient within the body, or by its gentle passing 
by the Prominent vessels of the Gills. 
 
The other Epistle contains some Ingenious Observations, touching the way, by 
which the Chicken, yet in the shell, is nourish't, videl. not by the conveyance of 
the Yolk into the Liver by the Umbilical vessels, nor into the Stomack by the 
[^p.178^] 
Mouth, but by a Peculiar ductus, by him described, into the Intestins, where, according 
to his alledged experience, it is turn'd into Chyle: which he affirms, he 
hath discover'd, by taking an Egge from under a brooding Hen, when the Chicken 
was ready to break forth, and when he was looking for the passage of the 
Yolk, out of its integument into the Liver, by finding it pass thence into the Intestins, 
as he found the White to do by the mouth into the belly. Whence he 
inclines to infer, that, since every fætus takes in at the mouth the liquor it 
swims in, and since the Chicken receives the white of the Egge into the mouth, 
and the yolk by the new discover'd ductus into the Intestins, it cannot be certainly 
made out, that a part of the Chyle is conveyed into the Liver, before it passes into 
the Heart: Exhorting in the mean time the Patrons of the Liver, that they would 
produce Experiments to evince their Ratiocinations. 
 
[}III. Regneri de Graeff, de Succi Pancreatici Natura & usu, Exercitatio Anatomico-medica.}] In this Tract, the Industrious Author, after he has enumerated the 
various opinions of Anatomists corcerning the use of that kernelly substance; 
call'd Pancreas (in English, the Sweetbred) endeavours to prove experimentally 
that this Glandule was not form'd by Nature, to separate any Excrementitious 
humor, and to convey it into the Intestins, but to prepare an useful juyce out of 
the Blood and Animal spirits, of a somewhat Acid taste, and to carry the same 
into the Gut, call'd Duodenum, to be there mixt with the Aliment, that has been 
in some degree already fermented in the Stomack, for a further fermentation, to 
be produced by the conflax of the said acid Pancreatick juyce and some Bilious 
matter, abounding with volatile Salt, causing an Effervescence; which done, that 
juyce is, together with the purer part of the nourishment, carried into the Milkie 
veins, thence into the common receptacle of the Chyle and Lymphatick liquor, and 
so through the ductus Thoracicus into the right Ventricle of the Heart. 
 
This Assertion, first advanced (saith the Author) partly by Gothofredus Mebius, 
partly by Franciscus de le Boe Sylvius, he undertakes to prove by experiments; 
which, indeed, he has with much industry, tried upon several Animals, to the end 
that he might collect some of this juyce of the Pancreas for a taste: which having 
at last obtained, and found it somewhat acid, he thereupon proceeds to deliver 
his opinion both of the constitution and quantity of this Succus in healthy Animals, 
and the vices thereof, in the unhealthy: deriving most diseases partly from its too 
great Acidity, or from its saltness, or harshness; partly from its paucity or redundancy: but especially, endeavouring to reduce from thence, as all intermittent 
Feavers (of all the Phaenomena whereof he ventures to assign the causes from this Hypothesis) so also the Gout, Syncope's, Stranguries, Oppilations, Diarrhæs, Dysenteries, Hysterical and Colick passions, &c. All which he concludes with mentioning 
the waies and remedies to cure the manifold peccancy of this juyce by Evacuations 
and Alterations. 
 
This seeming to be a new as well as a considerable discovery, it is hop'd, that others 
will by this intimation be invited to prosecute the same by further experiments, 
either to confirm what this Author has started, if true, or to rectifie it, if he 
be mistaken.
