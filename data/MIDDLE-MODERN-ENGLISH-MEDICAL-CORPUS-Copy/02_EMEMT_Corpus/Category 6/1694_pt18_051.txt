[}V. Part of a Letter to Dr. Clopton Havers, 
S. R. S. giving an Account of an extraordinary 
Hæmorrhagia at the Glandula Lachrymalis.}] 
 
SIR, 
SInce my coming to this place I have with a very 
strange Case. An Icterical discontented Woman 
having a desire to dye, wholly rejected the help of Medicine, 
and within three Months being well nigh her 
end, there happened an Eruption of Blood out of the 
Glandula Lachrymalis of one of her Eyes, without any 
External Injury: There was an evacuation of lbij. of 
Blood within the space of Thirty Hours. About a 
Week after the same Sluce was opened again, and she 
bled till she dyed. Now, I would fain to know what 
Blood-Vessels come to that Gland, from which such a 
vast quantity of Blood should be cast forth in so short 
a time.
