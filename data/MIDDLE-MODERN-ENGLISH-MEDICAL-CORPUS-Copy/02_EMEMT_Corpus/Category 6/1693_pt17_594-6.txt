[}V. Some Observations in the Dissection of a 
Ratt, communicated by Mr. R. W. S.R.S.}] 
 
THE Fore-Feet of a Rat resemble those of the Castor. 
The Hair is also some Fine, some Course; 
as in that Animal. The Tail scaly, with Hairs between 
[^p.595^] 
every Scale, like the Castors, which shews these two 
Animals to be something a-kin; and indeed the Water-Rat 
comes very near to the Beaver, and makes it's 
Holes in the bank-sides of Ponds after the same manner. 
 
The Penis in the Rat has a particular Passage near 
the Navel, as in Squirrels; and not at the Anus, as in 
the Castor. 
 
The Liver is full of little Specks as big as Pins Heads, 
which are the little Glands thereof. 
 
There was no Gall-Bladder, but a Ductus Felleus; 
possibly the Bladder was inclosed in the Parenchyma of 
the Liver, as it is in some Animals. 
 
The Cæcum was much larger than the Stomach, and 
in shape like that of the Castor. 
 
The Testicles lay not behind, but in the Groins on the 
Os Pubis. These were like a Bottom or Skein of Thred 
rumpled up together, which was visible through the 
Coats of the Testicle. This Thred continued of near 
the same Size in the Epididymides, only towards the 
Deferentia it grew larger, as is seen in the Figure. It 
was tender, and not easie to be unravel'd, so that I could 
not draw out above Three Quarters of a Yard. 
 
The Prostatæ lay under the Spermatic Arteries. 
The Kidneys were whitish with their Succenturiati, 
as in the Figure annext. At the Neck of the Bladder 
were inserted the Vesiculæ Seminales, transparent and 
fill'd with the Semen. 
 
Toward the End of the Penis, which had a Bony 
Gristle, were two large Glands, emptying themselves 
near the End of the Penis, and contained a Substance like 
Cream, as in the Dormouse, observed by Swammerdam.
