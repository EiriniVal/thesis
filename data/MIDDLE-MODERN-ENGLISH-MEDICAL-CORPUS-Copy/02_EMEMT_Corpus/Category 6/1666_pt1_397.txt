[}III. ANATOME MEDULLAE SPINALIS, 
ET NERVORUM inde provenientium, 
GERARDI BLASII, M. D.}] 
 
The Author shews in this little Tract a way of taking the entire 
Medulla Spinalis, or Marrow of the Back, out of its Theca or 
Bony Receptacle, without Laceration; which else happens frequently, 
both of the Nerves proceeding from it, and of the 
Coats investing it; not to name other parts of the same. This 
he affirms to have been put into practice by himself, by a fine 
Saw and Wedge; which are to be dexterously used: and he produceth 
accordingly in excellent Cuts, the Representations of the 
Structure of the said Medulla thus taken out, and the Nerves, 
thence proceeding; and that of several Animals, Dogs, Swine, 
Sheep. 
 
He intermixes several Observations, touching the Singleness 
of this Medulla, against Lindanus and others; its Original, vid. 
Whether it be the Root of the Brain, or the Brain the Root of it: 
its difference of Softness and Hardness in several Animals; where 
he notes, that in Swine it is much softer than in Dogs, &c. 
 
He exhibits also the Arteries, Nerves, and Veins, dispersed 
through this Medulla, and inquires, Whether the Nerves proceed 
from the Medulla it self, or its Meninx; and discourses 
also of the Principle and Distribution of the Nerves; referring 
for ampler information in this and the other particulars, to 
that Excellent Book of the Learned Dr. Willis, De Anatome 
Cerebri.
