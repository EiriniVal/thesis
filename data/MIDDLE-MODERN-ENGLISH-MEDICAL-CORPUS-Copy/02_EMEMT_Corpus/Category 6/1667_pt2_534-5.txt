& USU PVLMONUM.}] 
 
THis Author is of opinion, that all those Philosophers, who 
have hitherto inquired into the Nature and Use of Respiration, 
have only caught the shadow of it, nothing of the substance. 
And of this he gives this for the chief reason, because they have 
been too negligent in considering the first manifest motion of the 
Breast and Lungs in a Fætus; which particular being understood 
he thinks it very easie to judge of the Respiration of born Animals. 
He scruples not to reprehend the immortal Doctor Harvey, for 
having excluded from the office of the Lungs the use of Refrigeration; 
which he pretends to have asserted himself by most evident 
Experiments, and uncontroulable Reasons. 
 
To represent distinctly, what he undertakes to make out in this 
Tract, we may take notice of thse particulars. 
1. He takes pains to refute the Doctrine of Attraction, and to 
substitute in its place the Doctrine of Pulsion or Intrusion of Air into 
the Lungs. 
2. He endeavours to assert, that the Lungs do not fall down, 
but are by the Breast contracted. 
3. He affirms, to have clearly shew'd, what is the proper function 
and work of the Diaphragme, and other Muscles serving 
for Respiration. 
4. He pretends, to have experimentally evinced the Genuine 
Use of Respiration, and the Benefit thence resulting to the Animal 
Life. 
 
[^p.535^] 
In short, He makes Respiration to be a Motion of the Thorax 
and Lungs, whereby the Air is sometimes implled by the Nose, 
Mouth and Wind-pipe into the Lungs; and thence again expelled; 
farther to elaborate the Blood, by Refrigerating it, and by 
seperating its fuliginous steams, and so raise it to its ultimate and 
highest perfection, for the Conservation of the Life of Animals. 
 
Notice may be taken here by the by, that this Author in his 
Preface promises the publishing of a Treatise about Insects, in 
which he ingages to shew many wonderfull things in those little 
and seemingly contemptible Creatures, and in particular to demonstrate 
to the Eye the very method and manner how a Caterpiller 
is transmuted into a Chrysalis or Aurelia: By performing of 
which, he hopeth, he shall make the Curious bear more easily the 
loss of Dr. Harvey's Treatise on that Subject.
