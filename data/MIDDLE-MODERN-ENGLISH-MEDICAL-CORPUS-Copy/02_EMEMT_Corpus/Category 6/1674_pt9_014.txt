[}II. MEDICINA MILITARIS, or a Body of Military 
Medicines experimented, by Raymundus Mindererus, 
late chief Physitian of the Electoral Court of Bavaria, &c. 
English't out of High-Dutch. London, in 8=o=. 1674.}] 
 
THis Tract, though it be small in bulk, seems to deliver 
matters of no small use, both in War (which it was 
chiefly calculated for,) and in Peace; forasmuch as it comprehends 
Medicines, and Medical and Chirurgical Practices, 
for all sorts of common diseases, and other defects and 
infirmities of the Body; and is especially recommendable upon 
the account of the easie and cheap preparation of the remedies 
and helps requisite to cure and relieve diseased and 
wounded bodies; though they are not easily to be used without 
the direction of some good Physitian or Chirurgion. 
 
The Author was a person of great note in his time, and 
seems to have been a man of much Experience as well as 
Charity; delivering the particulars, contained in this Book, 
chiefly upon his own tryal and success, though partly 
also upon that of his skilful Collegues and other honest 
persons.
