[}II. NATHAN. HIGHMORI de HYSTERICA 
& HYPOCHONDRIACA PASSIONE, Responsio 
Epistolaris ad Doct. Willis Med. Londinensem. 
Londini, 1670. in 4=o=.}] 
 
THe occasion of Writing this Epistle, was, That 
the Learned Dr. Willis in his Pathologia Cerebri 
undertakes to confute the Causes of the Hysterick 
and Hypochondriack Passions, as they are assigned 
by our Author in his Exercitations, concerning these 
two Symptons, published An. 1660. Who thereupon 
thought himself obliged to write this Defence, in behalf 
of what he had formerly delivered upon this 
Subject. 
 
The Controversie, as to the former of these Passions, 
consists in this, Whether the cause of it is to 
be referred more immediately to the Genus Nervosum, 
and it be primarily a Convulsive Symptom, depending 
on the Brain, and the Nerves thereof; or whether it 
ought to be imputed to the Blood, rushing too impetuously 
into and stuffing up the Lungs? Hence 
[^p.1090^] 
Dr. Willis asserts the former, and objects against the 
latter, of which, the Vindication is undertaken in this 
Epistle; wherein it is considered among divers other 
things. 1. That the Hysterick Passion is not always 
accompanied with Convulsions; where also the existence 
of the Succus nutritius (on which Dr. Willis 
his Doctrine seems to depend) is called in question, 
and several Arguments alledged to the contrary. 
2. That, if the Succus nutritius in the Nerves, be 
by a violent explosion dilated, and that by the means 
of Fixed Salts mixed in the Nerves with Acid ones 
(according to Dr. Willis;) the same may happen upon 
the Concurrence and Conflict of the like Salts in 
the Blood. 
 
Concerning the Hypochondriack Passion, the Question 
between these two Physitians, is, Whether the first and 
chief cause of that distemper, be the Weakness and 
Laxeness of the tone of the Stomach and its Fibres, 
whereby a vicious Chyle and Blood is generated, that 
causes such a Fermentation, upon which do ensue 
Trembling and Palpitations of the Heart, Swoundings, 
Fear, Sadness? &c. This is affirmed, and here further 
asserted by our Author, but denied by Dr. Willis; 
concerning which, the Reader will finde the best satisfaction 
in perusing the Writings themselves of 
both parties. 
 
In the mean time he may please to take notice here, 
that Dr. Highmore in this Epistle, intersperses some not 
inconsiderable Remarks concerning the Use of the 
Spleen, which part he endeavors to free from those 
[^p.1091^] 
imputations it is commonly charged with, being of 
opinion, That the Blood is originally depraved not 
by the Spleen, but its matter by the Stomack.
