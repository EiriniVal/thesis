[}An Extract of a Letter 
Written by Dr. Durston from Plymouth Novemb. 28. 1669. giving 
an Account, why the late Big-breasted Woman was 
not open'd after her Death.}] 
 
SIR, IT was design'd to have examin'd the Viscera of Eliz. 
Travers, but her Aunt, who was with her and 
took care of her, fell into such a passion upon the proposal of 
opening her, that she seem'd to be for the time besides her 
self; and I could not by any art get her out of the Chamber, 
where the Corps was laid out, till she saw her nail'd up in her 
Coffin. I never saw such fondness shewn to a dead Body; and 
I was sufficiently troubled to be thus disappointed by a fond extravagant 
Woman: But yet I believe, if I had examin'd the 
Entralls, I should have seen little or nothing extraordinary. For, 
to the last, I could perceive no ill smell from her Breath, or streightness 
upon the Chest, or painfulness in her Breathing; and the 
Egesta per urinam, &c. were well enough. If any thing 
worth Observation do further occurr in these parts, I shall upon 
every opportunity communicate it to you, who am, &c.
