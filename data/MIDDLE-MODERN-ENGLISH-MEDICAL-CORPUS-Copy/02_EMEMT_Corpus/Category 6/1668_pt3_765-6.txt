[}A Note, 
Relating to the formerly publisht Narrative about Empty Tubes, 
serving for a decay'd sight; imparted by the same Author 
in a Letter of August 10. 1668.}] 
 
SIr, I pray you, give notice, That I have now tried Convexe 
Spectacles, which about 3 years agoe (before my sight fell 
into this decay) agreed very well for my use; and putting these 
[^p.766^] 
Glasses into the Tapers, I found the smallest Prints somewhat 
larger, but not so clear, so distinct, nor so pleasing to the Eye, as 
when I use the Empty Tapers. Also I am so confirm'd, that 
these empty tapers do preserve, strengthen, 
and in some small degree recover the 
sight. [/1./] And I find my self best at ease 
with those Leathern Tubes, I first used; 
and rather without any fastning to the 
bone of the Spectacles: For, as they 
hang in that slight manner, I can with a 
touch of my finger raise them up, or 
bow them down, divide them or unite to 
take in the same object, which is more than I said at first. And 
I put them off and on as speedily and as easily as any other Spectacles.
