[}An Account 
Concerning a Woman having a Double Matrix; as the Publisher hath 
Englished it out of French, lately printed at Paris, where the Body 
was opened.}] 
 
This Figure (which in the Cut here annex'd is the II.) reprsents the two 
[/1./] Matrixes, 
found januar. 6 
1669. by Benoit 
Vassal Chirurgeon, 
opening the Body of a woman of 32. years of age, of a sanguin Constitution, 
and a masculin port. These two Matrixes were so well disposed 
by an extraordinary contrivance of Nature, that the True one had conceived 
eleven severall times, viz. 7. males and 4. femals, all born at 
the full time, and all perfectly well form'd; but they were at last follow'd 
by a brother yet a fætus, that was conceiv'd in an adjunct Uterus, in a 
place so little capable of distension, that seeking enlargement, after it had caused 
to the Mother for two months and an half grievous symptoms, did at 
last, being of the age of about 3. or 4. months, break prison, and found 
its grave in that of its mother, by a very great effusion of blood in the 
whole capacity of her abdomen; which cast the mother into such violent 
convulsive motions for 3. days together, that she dyed of them. VVhereupon 
the said Uassal, after, having embalmed the parts, he had made 
at his house for a whole month together the particular dissection thereof, 
before all the most Curious and knowing Physitians, Chirurgeons, Apothecaries, 
Mid-wifes, and other Searchers of Nature, that are in Paris, 
thought good to preserve the History thereof by committing it and the 
Figure of the parts spoken of, to the Press, together with a Table, for 
better explanation; which we think fit here to annex in Latin:
