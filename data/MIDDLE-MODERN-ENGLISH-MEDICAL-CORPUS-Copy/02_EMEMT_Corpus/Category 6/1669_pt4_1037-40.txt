II. Instead of the other Book, of which we purposed to give here 
[^p.1038^] 
au Accompt, we find our selves oblieged somewhat to enlarge that which 
was, for want of more leisure, too cursorily g_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ven in Numb. 49. of 
Dr, Witties Answer to Hydrologia Chymica, concerning the Scarbrow 
Spaw. To do therefore right to this Worthy person, we ought among 
other things to take notice of what he saith in his Preface; That when he 
first published his Book, he had found the Scarbrough Spaw, even in 20. years 
Experience, to be eminently succesful in the Cure of very many diseases, which 
had resisted all rational Methods, that had been used either by himse_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]f, or others 
of his Faculty. That now his Practice had been near 30. years, and 
that now he can add some considerable Cures, which he hath not hitherto 
expressed. 
 
Now to sollicit this Learned Doctor and others for theit farther Discovery's 
of Sanative Waters, and to add weight to the Argument; we may 
observe, that A. 1634. Dr. Thobias Whitaker, a famous Physitian of 
Norwich, Published in English a discourse [^GREEK OMITTED^], or Of Drinking 
Mineral Waters; particularly reflecting upon a Mineral Water then 
discovered in Norfolk, and producing the Joynt-advice of all Antiquity 
(as he pretends,) at least of the best Writers, n_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]mely of Hippocrates, 
Galen, Avicenna &c. generally against all use of Mineral Waters either 
to be taken inwardly, or for any outward application. This Discourse 
is recmmended by the express approbation and elogies of Dr William Clement, 
Fellow and Register of the Colledge of Physitians in London, and 
by Dr. Alex. Read Fellow of the s_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]me Colledge. 
 
This may give fit Caution against the rash Use of _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]uch Waters, when 
ordinary Medicins may be effectual; and to take the advice of skilful 
Physitians in the Use of them. And for the Poor, which are not able 
to retain Physitians, nor to pay Apothecaries, they must abide the adventu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e 
of rep_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]iring to those kind Fountains, which doe not unfrequently 
cure, when all other costly and tedious Methods doe faile. And here 
they may find the Suffrage of many Curious and Inquisitive Authors, and 
the evidence of much Experience: Here they may see the real and great 
performances of Cures, and what are the particul_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]r Cures, what the 
particular Ingredients, and what the mixtures, together with the several 
ways of Analysing the Waters &c. 
 
As to the Sanative Properties in general of many Minerall Fountains 
(besides the numerous Experiments of all sorts of people for many Ages 
in some places, and of late discovery in other places) Dr. Wittie recites 
the Judicious testimony of Dr. French and Dr Dean concerning the 
Knarsborough Spaw; Doctor Jordan concerning the Baths in Somersetshire; 
Dr. Heer's Spadocrene; Doctor Frambesarius and Dr. Ryetius 
of the Sauvenir in Germany, Dr. Fallopius de Therm. Aquis and the 
Sp_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ws in Germany and Rome, de Dalneo Aponitano, and the water at 
_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]a: O_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] such waters in general, Parac_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]lsus and Helmont: And this 
[^ORIG. BLURRED^] _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]s_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ription of St. Mungo's Well at Cockgrave. To which we 
[^p.1039^] 
may now add Astrap-well in Northampton, lately discovered, together 
with that at Stall-bridge in Somersetshire, which last begins also to be in 
high esteem for extraordinary Cures of the Scorbute, Asthma &c. which, 
besides common fame, is (as we were freshly informed by a worthy friend) 
attested by Dr. Highmore, who affirmes also upon his own Tryal, that 
it hath a larger proportion of the Minerals, than Astrap-water; but 
that the force holds not, if removed from the Spring-head. And Dr. 
Wittie hath himself sufficiently asserted the Vertues of the Scarborough-Spaw; 
and particularly, that it cured the Asthma, Inveterate Catharrs, 
Hecticks, Consumptions, Scurvy, Dropsy, and other diseases, when they 
seemed incurable: That an Alderman of Hull (to whom himself, and the famous 
Dr. Primrose, were, 15. years agoe, joyntly Physitians for the 
Asthma) h_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]d in few d_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ys perfect cure by the Spaw, and is yet living to 
vouch the testimony: So that all the neighbourhood are taught by frequent 
experience to sing the old Song of Claudian, which he made for his Aponus. 
 
Publica morborum requies, commune medentum 
Auxilium, præsens Numen, inempta Salus. 
 
And this old Record may put us in mind, that lofty Groves and healing 
Fountains have been reputed Holy in old times, and we can show the 
Hospitals, which have been long agoe built and endowed on purpose to entertain 
the poor p_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ssengers in their travels to such waters. This I had not 
here mentioned, but to introduce our Authors weighty remark; That these 
Waters loose all their virtues, yea their quantity and bulk also, though _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n 
Glasses, and under the Hermetick Seale, if removed from the Fountain-head; 
that then they became suddenly putrid, ill-colored, loosing the tast 
and s_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]nt, and being very noxious, and begetting the J_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]undise and worse diseases 
The like is affirmed by Dr French, that the Knarsborough Water expires 
through Glass and the firmest Seales. And Dr. Heer affirmes of his 
Spadocrene, that by such removals, illas a communibus nihil discrepasse, ut 
quibus singulis lagenis aquæ vitrum (which is guessed to be half a pint) decesserat. 
He adds; Decedit etiam quantitati - si fons hic alio transferatur - 
quia spiritu turgentia plus loci, quam eo privata, occupare amant. And Frambesarius 
reports as much of the Sauvenir, that in bottles well healed up, 
there wanted to every lagena (fl_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sk) one Glass of its measure (doubtless 
through the losse of the volatile Spirits.) Here we want instruction, Whether 
the decrease was as well of Weight as of Bulk or Quantity. 
 
Whatever these Spirits be, which will neither endure to travel from the 
place, nor will be confined in any botle, not under any Seal; Dr. Wittie 
undertakes to evince by good Proofs, and manifold indications, that these 
Scarborough waters have a mixture or tincture of Iron, Allum, Nitre, and 
probably of a small dose of Common Salt: Nay, he affirmes punctually 
(p. 175, as upon his own Experiment, that 5. quarts of this water contain 
at the least an Ounce of Minerals, and in dry years, 10. drams; 
And yet that the usual dose for women to remove the Green sickness is [^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
quarts of water, and sometimes more, 
 
[^p.1040^] 
He further voucheth his own Trial (p. 179.) that Knarsborough-water hath 2. Ounce 
of Salt in a Gallon, though it be 40. miles distant from the S_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]a: And that he hath 
found also by tryal, the 16th part of the Nothern Sea-water near Scarborough to be a body 
of Salt (an Ounce of Salt for every pint;) and he conceives the Souther_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] Seas to contain 
a greater proportion of Salt. Here we must distinguish, that the 2. Ounces of Salt 
above mentioned, to be found in every Gallon of Knarsborough-water, belong to the 
Well there called the Sulphur-well: And for the healing properties of the Sweet well 
(as they call the other Well at Knarsborough) he refers to the Ingenious and illustrious 
Experiments of Dr. French and Dr. Dean. 
 
All which being considered, we cannot but add, that whoever discovers such healing 
waters, and publickly prescribes the safe and right use of them, does really distribute 
larger aud nobler Almes, than if he built and endowed a Savoy. For this prolongs life, 
and re_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ores health, (whch is sometimes better than life) both to rich and Poor, to Natives 
and strangers, to Neighbors and Travellors. 
 
We cannot take off our hands here, without annexing our Authors related Experiment 
of Carps (p. 25.) which were taken out of Ponds newly drained, and being 
put with fresh watter into a Copper Brewing-vessel, to be preserved but for one night, 
were all found dead in the morning. This he imputes to the poisonous steams of the Copper 
communicated to the cold water. 
 
Among the Causes of Hot-Springs, he doth (p. 181.) alledge a considerable remark 
on an Observation, made by the late Lord Fairfax, of some heaps of White powder, 
which he found sweat out of the Earth near Bath (in Somersetshire,) which being 
put into the water, makes it hot; as my self (saith the Doctor) did experience 5. or 
6. years after his Lordship had taken it up. 
 
As to his last Experimental Demonstrations and Observations, How the fall of Rain 
and Snow may generally and most frequently be the cause of our purest, liveliest and 
most lasting Springs, they doe all agree most punctually in all ci_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]cumstances, with the 
Experiences and Observations of an Antient and very W_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]rthy Gentleman, who lives on 
the side of Mendip-hills, and hath had his Eyes always from his Youngest d_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ys upon 
the fairest and fullest Sources and Amnery's, I say not of Mendip but I think I may 
say of this Island. This Gentleman hath given to a friend of his the Instances and 
Particulars under his own hand, both for the Springs about Mendip, and in other parts 
of England; and hath many other Antient Witnesses to joyn with him in the same Certificate. 
And yet Dr. Wittie attributes much (some will say, more than enough) to 
the Conversion of Air into Water in the Subterraneous Channels: For the Illustration 
of which he himself knew a Sergeant, belonging to Hull, who in a Diabete did void above 
6. quarts or 12. pounds of Urine every 24 hours, f_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]r some weeks together, till all 
his Musculous parts were dissolved into Urine; the measure whereof did farr exceed the 
weight of his whole Body, and of his Meat and Drink: In all this time he drank not 
3. pints of drink in a day. I know not whether I dare allea_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]g_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] here Sir Kene_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]m Digby's 
re_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ltion, he recited of the Nun, which voided 200 pounds of Water, as from her bladder, 
every 24. hours, for some weeks together: or that Older record of a si_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]k Maid in Italy, 
who did every day voyd 36. pints or pounds of Urine for the space of 60. days; during 
which time there were collected 1740. pounds of Urine more than the weight of all 
her Meat and Drink, that she had taken. Horum & similium sides penes Authores est_[^ORIG. BLURRED^].
