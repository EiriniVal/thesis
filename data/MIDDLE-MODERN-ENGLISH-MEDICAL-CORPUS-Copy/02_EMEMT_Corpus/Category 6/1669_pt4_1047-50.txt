[}An Extract of a Letter 
Written by the Learned Dr. William Durston, Physitian at Plimouth, 
to the Right Honorable the Lord Vice-Count Br_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]uncker 
as President of the R. Society; concerning a very sudden and excessive 
Swelling of a Womans Breasts.}] 
 
My Lord 
IN obedience to the comm_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]nds of the Right Honorable the 
Lord Ambass_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]dour for Barbary, I present y_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ur Lordship 
with a Phæmonenon an_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] matt_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]r of fact in Nature, which, for 
its rarity and p_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]odigiousness, may, with a lesser check to me f_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]om 
your Lordship for the pr_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sumption, and a lesser regret for the 
[^p.1048^] 
avocation, obtain the favour of your perusal. The thing is 
evident, and shews itself, and can w_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]thall be attested by thousands, 
but above all the rest by his Excellency, the said Lord 
Ambassadour, who was an Eye-witness of it, and imposed this 
task on me, of giving your Lordship a perfect Narrative of the 
wonder, which is as follows; 
 
Elizabeth Trevers, 23. or 24. years of age, fair of complexion, 
brown-hair'd, of an healthy constitution, low of stature, 
of honest repute, but of mean and poor parentage, near 
this Town, was on Friday July 3d. 1669. in good health, and 
went well to bed, where she took as good rest and sleep, as ever 
before, but in the morn_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ng, when she awaken'd, and attempted 
to turn herself in her bed, was not able, finding her Bre_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sts 
so swell'd, that she was affrighted to an astonishment. Then 
endeavoring to sit up, the weight of he_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] B_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]sts fastned her to 
her bed; where she hath layn ever since, yet whithout all 
pain and weakness either in her Breasts, or in any other 
part. 
 
This being nois'd abroad, several Physitians and Chyrurgions 
resorted to her: some proposed cutting off her Breasts, 
which I was wholly against, advising for the present only an emollient 
and temperately wa_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]me fotus, and once gave her a Bolus 
with ******; upon the taking of which she had ten motions 
deorsum, and the swelling somewhat abated; but the M_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]id 
was so weaken'd upon it for 2. or 3. days after, that I durst not 
attempt any thing of that natu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e since; sed quia passa fuit suppressionem 
mensium per sex retro menses, Diuretica non nulla, & 
sanguinis menstrui prolectamenta præscripsi, i_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]tending also Phlebotomy. 
The Tubuli or pipes of the Br_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]asts are all very hard and 
swelled; and indeed the whole breasts seem to be nothing else 
but those tubuli, and little or nothing of wind or water. As 
near as we can guess, the left breast weighs about 25. pounds, 
but the right somewhat less. And the skin of the B_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ck, 
Neck and Belly seem to be drawn towards the Breasts _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]o serve 
for the distension. The measures of the Breasts are thes_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]; 
 
[^p.1049^] 
See Fig. III. 
 
The Circumference of the right Breast 2. Feet. 7. Inch. 
O_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] the left Breast 3. Feet. 1 1/2 Inch. 
The length of the right Breast from the Coller-bone 1. Feet. 5 1/2 Inch. 
The length of the left Brest 1. Feet. 7 1/2 Inch. 
The breadth of the right Breast as it lyes 1. Feet. 1 Inch. 
The breadth of the left 1. Feet. 4 1/2 Inch. 
 
Thus farr, My lord, the matter of fact, faithfully related. 
 
Now what should occasion those monstrous tumors of the 
whole Breasts, and that so suddenly in one night, keeps us in 
great suspence. There occurs nothing in this point satisfactory 
in the writings of Platerus, Rhodericus a Castro, Fontanus, 
Forestus, or any other of the Moderns, that I have seen, writing 
de Morbis Mulierum, suitable to what may be offer'd upon the 
Data of the Circulation of the Blood, the Lymphæducts, and 
the Vasa Chylifera Thoracica, and probably some C_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]pillary vessels 
branching thence (in their progress to the Sub-clavials) 
through the Intercostal Muscles into the Breasts. I humbly 
beg pardon for this tediousness &c. 
 
Plymouth, July 1=o=, 1669. 
 
This Narrative having been produced and read at the R. Society, 
and the Author of it thanked for his communication, and desired 
to impart what he should further observe in this very odd Accident, 
he was pleased to write, some while after, a second Letter to 
the Publisher, as follows; 
 
Sir. 
I Had written to you ere this, but that I unhappily mislaid your 
Letter among other papers; but having, after much search, 
found it again, I return the Most Honorable Society and 
you my very humble thanks for your invitation of me 
to continue my Observations about the vnusuall swelling 
of the Breasts, heretofore described. 
 
About the beginning of this month, our prodigious woman 
in Coughing brought up at several times some blood; but this 
I soon took off; and at that time there appeared several cutaneous 
ulcers upon her Breasts and other parts, & abunde~ in verendis 
(ut a~ sæminis edocebar) which last I cured; but those on 
her breasts in part remain, and daily discharge, by the sole application 
[^p.1050^] 
of Cole-leaves, [^ORIG. BLURRED^] good quantity of sanious matter. And 
the Patient complaining also at that time of grievous interjuncture 
pains, especially vpon the Tibiæ, I suspected &c. and applyed 
Empl. de Ran, *** and gave her 3. succeeding mornings 
*** for a dose. The third day, it wrought sursum & 
deorsum pretty briskly; after which her pains vanish't and many 
of those vlcuscula; and her breasts (which, since her Case; 
formerly sent up, were grown considerably bigger and very painful) 
much less'ned, and her pains also; and she, though 
drooping much before, and out of hopes of life, exceedingly 
revived. This indicated to me, what I was further to do for 
her. I gave her on sunday last ***; which wrought upward 
plentifully; and she daily gets strength since, aud her Breasts 
abate. I designe to salivate her, in hopes to correct that vitious 
ferment, which is spued out of the Genus nervosnm into the 
Breasts, and contributes much to those tumors. But I shall 
now stop my hand, &c. 
 
Plymouth Septemb. 17. 1669.
