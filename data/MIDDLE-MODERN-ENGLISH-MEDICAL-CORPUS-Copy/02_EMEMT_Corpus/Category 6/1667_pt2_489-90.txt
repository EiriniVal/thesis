[}An Advertisement concerning the Invention of the Transfusion 
of Bloud.}] 
 
THE Author of these Papers returning now to his former Exercises, 
which by an extraordinary Accident he was necessitated to interrupt 
for some months last past, thought fit to comprise the Transactions of all 
the Months omitted in one Tract: In the very beginning of which he must 
inform the Reader, that if himself had published that Letter, which came 
abroad in July last, Concerning a new way of curing sundry diseases by Transfusion 
of Bloud, written to Monsieur de Montmor, &c. by J. Denis Prof. of 
Philosophy, &c. he should then have taken notice, as he doth now, of what 
[^p.490^] 
is affirmed in that Letter about the time and place of the Conception of that 
Transfusing design; and intimated to the Curious, that how long soever 
that Experiment may have been conceived in other parts (which is needless 
to contest) it is notorious, that it had its birth first of all in England; 
some Ingenious persons of the Royal Society having first started it there, 
several years ago, (as appears by their Journal) and that dextrous Anatomist, 
D. Lower, reduced it into practice, both by contriving a method 
for the Operation, and by successfully executing the same: wherein he 
was soon overtaken by several happy Trials of the skilful hand of D. Edmund 
King, and others, encouraged thereunto by the said Society; which 
being notified to the world Numb. 19. and 20. of these Transactions, Print-Novem. 
19. and Decemb. 17. 1666; the Experiment was, soon after that 
time, heard of to have been tried in forein parts, without hearing any 
thing then of its having been conceived ten years ago.
