[}III A Philosophical Essay, declaring the probable CAVSES of STONES 
in the Greater World, in order to find out the Causes and Cure of the Stone 
in the Kidneys and Bladder of Men: by D. Thomas Sherley, Physitian 
in Ordinary to his Majesty, Londini in 80.}] 
 
THe Ingenious Author of this Essay having proposed to himself 
to publish a Medicinal Tract concerning the most probable Cause 
of the Stone in the Bodies of Animals, found it necessary to premise 
this Inquiry into the Causes and Nature of Petrefaction in the greater 
World in general; to see, whether the Causes be not the same in both, 
or at least bear not some analogy or resemblance to one another. 
 
In the doing of which, he thought good to relate a number of select 
Histories of Petrifications, and then to examine the causes by which 
they were performed. In which latter part, having waved the Aristotelian 
doctrine of this point, nor found a full satisfaction in that of the 
vulgar Chymists, he closeth with that ancient Hypothesis, which imports, 
that Stones and all other Sublunary Bodies are made of Water condensed 
by the power of Seeds, which by the vertue of their fermentive Odours 
perform these transmutations upon matter. For the better understanding 
of which he premises some Generals, and then descends to 
particular proofs of what he asserts: concerning which we can do no 
better than to remit the Reader to the Author himself.
