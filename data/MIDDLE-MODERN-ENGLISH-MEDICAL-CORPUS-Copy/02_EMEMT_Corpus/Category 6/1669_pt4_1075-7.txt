[}A Letter 
Written by an Intelligent and Worthy English Man from Paris, 
to a Considerable Member of the R. Society in London, 
concerning some Transactions there, relating to the Experiment 
of the Transfusion of Blood.}] 
 
SIR, 
YOu have such a Relation to the Royal Society, that I think 
my self obliged to impart unto you the Honourable mention, 
I heard of that Noble Institution in the Grand Chambre 
[^p.1076^] 
of the Parlement here, on Thursday last, that Society being then 
publickly instanc'd in for the Source of Noble Experiments, and 
having the Precedency of those in Germany, Italy, and other places 
of Europe; in that order, wherein the Orator thought fit to 
rank them. 
 
The Occasion of mentioning it was, That one Monsieur Denys, 
a Physitian, had been question'd before the Lieutenant Criminel 
here for the Death of his Patient (a Man that had been 
stark Mad for several years) who had expired under his hands, 
while he was Transfusing Blood into him, according to the New 
Experiment. The Operation had been twice perform'd with 
good success; the Patient having had thereupon a good interval 
of two Moneths after the first, and all hopes of a longer after the 
second, had it not been for the debauches in Wine and Brandy, 
that he fell to, soon after the Operation. He was a Brittan by 
birth, and the Original of his Madness, Love. That which Mr. 
Denys, his Advocate, very much gloried in, was, that (besides that 
the Experiment had been practised with good, at least with no 
ill, success, in England, Germany, Italy, Holland, &c. and defended 
in Theses in almost all the Universities of France) there were 
two persons, a Man and a Woman, present in the Audience, that 
received a benefit to Admiration from the Experiment, after 
they had been abandon'd by all Physitians and other helps. 
 
In Justifying the Introduction and Use of New Experiments 
he said, That the Most precious Life to this State (viz That of 
his Most Christian Majesty) had been saved by the Administration 
of a lately invented Emetique. 
 
This Advocat was the Son of Monsieur le Premier President 
de la Moignon. The same was, not long since, in our Court, and 
is, I perceive, well known to it, and infinitely satisfied with the 
Civilities he had received from several persons there Though 
this was his first Action, yet his performance was a Master-piece, 
and he had an Audience sutable; all Friends, I suppose, to his 
Family: among them were the Duke of Enguyen, the Dukes of 
Luynes, Mortemar, Chaulne, and a World of other Great Persons, 
Men and Women. 
 
The Pleading for the Widow Plaintiff will be on Thursday 
next; but any odds would be laid on the Defendants side; though 
[^p.1077^] 
some partial Men here are more than suspected to set on the Widow. 
Pardon, Sir, this Interruption, and believe me, 
Yours, &c. 
 
Paris. Nov. 30. 1669.
