[}A farther Account of an Observation above-mentioned, 
about white Blood.}] 
 
Since the Printing of the former Sheet, there is this farther 
account from the same hand. Mr Boyle, 
 
I have at length, according to your desire, receiv'd from 
the Ingenious Dr. Lower, an account in Writing of the Observation 
about Chyle found in the Blood; which though 
you may think strange, agrees well with some Experiments 
of his and mine, not now to be mention'd. The Relation, 
though short, comprizing the main Particulars of what he 
had more fully told me in Discourse, I shall give it you with 
little or no variation from his own Words. 
 
[^p.118^] 
A Maid, after eating a good Break-fast, about seven in 
the Morning, was let Blood about eleven the same day in 
her Foot; the first Blood was receiv'd in a Porringer, and 
within a little while it turn'd very white; the last Blood was 
received in a Sawcer, which turned white immediately, like 
the white of a Custard. Within five or six hours after, he 
(the Physitian) chanced to see both, and that in the Porringer 
was half Blood and half Chyle, swimming upon it 
like a Serum as white as Milk, and that in the Sawcer all 
Chyle, without the least appearance of a drop of Blood; 
and when he heated them distinctly over a gentle Fire, they 
both harden'd: As the white of an Egge when 'tis heated, 
or just as the Serum of Blood doth with heating, but far 
more white. This Maid was then in good health, and onely 
let Blood because she never had her Courses, yet of a very 
florid clear Complexion.
