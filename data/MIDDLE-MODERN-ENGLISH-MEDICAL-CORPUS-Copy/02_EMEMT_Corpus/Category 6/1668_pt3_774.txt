[}An Extract of a Letter lately written by an observing person 
to a Friend of the Publisher, concerning the vertue of 
Antimony.}] 
 
I Tryed that a Boare, to whom I had given an ounce of crude Antimony 
at a time, putting him into the Sty, would be fat a fortnight 
before another, having no Antimony, upon the like feeding. 
Antimony will recover a Pig of the Measles; by which it 
appears to be a great purifyer of the Blood. I knew a Horse, that 
was very lean and scabbid, and could not be fatted by any keeping, 
to whom Antimony was given for two Moneths together 
every morning, and that upon the same keeping he became exceeding 
fat. One of my own Horses having had the fashions, 
and being cured, had notwithstanding extream running leggs; so 
that after he had passed the course of Farryers twice, to be cured, 
it was not done; but upon my giving him Antimony but one 
week, he was presently healed. 
 
The manner of using it, is this. Take one drachme of crude 
Antimony powder'd for one Horse, and when you give him his 
Oats in a morning, shake it out upon his Oats in a little heap in 
the middle: If he be hungry, and you keep off his head from 
every other part of the Oats, he will snap it up in his mouth at 
one bite, when you let him goe. Some Horses greatly like it, 
others refuse it after the first. If he refuse it, cover it with Oats 
thinly; its done: or make it in Balls.
