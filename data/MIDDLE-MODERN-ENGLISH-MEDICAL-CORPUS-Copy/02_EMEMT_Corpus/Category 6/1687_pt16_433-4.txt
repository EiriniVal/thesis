[}A Conjecture at the Quantity of Blood in Men, 
together with an Estimate of the Celerity of its 
Circulation. By Allen Moulin, M. D. Reg. S. S.}] 
 
IN a Sheep weighing alive 118 l. we found but 5 l. 1/4 of 
Blood which is but 12/472 of the weight of the Sheep. In 
a Lamb weighing 30 l. 1/2 when living, but there was but 
1 l. 1/2 of Blood which is nearly a 20th part. 
 
In a Duck weighing alive 2 l. 14 Ounces 50 gr. we 
found an Ounce a half and 53 gr. of Blood, which is less 
than a 28th of the whole weight of the living Duck. 
 
In a Rabbit weighing 10 Ounces, 7 Dr. and 50 gr. we 
found 2 Dr. 57 gr. of Blood, which is about a 30th Part. 
 
In the right Ventricle and Auricle of the Heart of a 
Dog, I found 6 ounces of Blood, after that I injected into 
the jugular Vein a Liquor that coagulated the Blood. I 
found a greater quantity of Blood in the Heart of another 
Dog, whom I treated after the same manner. The Hearts 
were much distended by the Blood found in them. I shall 
therefore suppose, that 4 ounces only were received at a 
time by these Hearts without force, that is naturally: And 
least I should suppose a greater quantity of Blood to be 
admitted at a time than really is, I will suppose a Man's 
Heart, which is much larger, (and has much larger Vessels 
than those I speak of) to receive but 4 ounces at each 
Diastole. Allowing 75 Pulses to every Minute, there will 
be 4500 in an hour, and 18000 ounces of Blood transmitted 
in that time. This last Number is the Product of the 
foregoing 4500, being multiplyed by 4, the Number of 
Ounces at a Diastole. 
 
[^p.434^] 
Now if we shall suppose that a Man's Blood bears the 
same Proportion to his weight, as that of any of the aforesaid 
Animals had to its weight, which in a Lamb was the 
greatest, being 1/20 part, it will follow that the quantity of 
circulating Blood in a Man weighing 160 l. will not exceed 
8 l. or 128 ounces; according to which computation 
the Blood will circulate 140 times in an hour. But let us 
suppose that instead of 8 l. the masse of Blood in such a 
Man be 12 l. it will follow that it will circulate between 
93 and 94 times in an hour; which is a circulation and 
half, and somewhat more, every minute. I take this last 
computation to be very modest, when especially it is considered 
that in the Lamb when opened, there was scarce a 
dram of Blood; in the Sheep not 3 oun. to be seen. From 
the celerity of the motion of the Blood now mentioned, 
we may give a good account of the suddain Refection with 
victuals, and particularly such as are liquid: we may also 
account for the quick passing of Urine, from the same 
thing; and also the quick motion of the Chyle into the 
Breasts of Nurses, without supposing unknown passages, 
from the Stomach or any other part into the Bladder and 
Breasts. 
 
Half an ounce of Blood at a Diastole is the greatest 
quantity that I remember any Anatomist supposes to gett 
into the Heart, and they suppose the quantity of Blood in 
the Body to be between 15 and 25 l. by which it will appear 
how their computations and mine differ.
