to the Right Honourable the Earl of Nottingham. 
London, Printed for Peter Buck, 
at the Sign of the Temple near the Inner-Temple-Gate, 
Fleetstreet. In Octavo. 1694.}] 
 
THE Design of this Book, as the Author says 
himself in his Preface, is to state the Boundaries 
of Ancient and Modern Learning, that so Men may 
[^p.265^] 
know which to recur to as their Guides, if they would 
be Masters of any particular part of Knowledge; it being 
in his Opinion a very pernicious thing, and very 
destructive to the Increase of Solid Learning, to rest upon 
the Ancients where the Moderns have succeeded them; 
or to study Second-hand Books upon Subjects which 
have been borrowed from the Ancients; especially since 
he pretends to prove that in some things either of them 
have so far out-done the other, that it cannot be a matter 
of Dispute amongst able Judges, to which side one 
ought to give the preference. Hereupon, in order to 
make out this Proposition, he divides his Discourse into 
three general Parts. (1.) He enquires what Sciences the 
Ancients may have been supposed to bring to Perfection, 
chiefly because they got the start by being born first. 
(2.) Wherein the Ancients have excelled the Moderns, 
and why they may have been supposed to have been so. 
(3.) Wherein the Moderns have out-done the Ancients. 
Under the first Head he reckons Ethicks and Politicks; 
under the second Oratory and Poesie; all the other parts 
of Learning have either been improved by the Moderns, 
or the Question cannot well be decided (Chap 1.) 
 
He begins with Ethicks and Politicks. Here he supposes 
that the Ancients might have been as well skilled 
as the Moderns, since nothing but Experience is requisite 
to understand those things, which the Ancient Ægyptians, 
Greeks, and Romans could not miss of, who 
lived in formed Societies for so many Ages; accordingly 
he Instances in Aristotle's Ethicks to Nicomachus, Xenophon's 
Cyrus, Theophrastus's Characters, Tully's Offices, 
and several other Ancient Books as Master-pieces in their 
respective kinds, of Moral and Political Knowledge. 
Yet all this, according to out Author, requires no particular 
strength of Genius to compleat it, since the Chineses 
and Peruvians seem to have done as great things 
towards the raising of wise and lasting Governments, 
[^p.266^] 
which must be the effects of extraordinary Skill in this 
part of Knowledge, as any of those Nations which are 
so much commended for Civil Prudence. (Chap. 2.) 
 
Next he goes to Oratory and Poesie. He supposes that 
Virgil, and Homer, and Horace, and Terence may have 
been better Poets than any of the Moderns in their several 
ways; and that Demosthenes and Cicero have not 
been equalled by Modern Orators. He thinks that the 
Excellency of the Greek Poetry might at first proceed 
from the manageableness of the Greek Language, and 
afterwards from the great Veneration which was paid to 
their Poets, which made very many put in for the Prize, 
of whom some few, one or two at least of a sort, arrived 
to so great an Excellency, that others have despaired 
to equal them, since Imitation in those things, not only 
neauseates but clogs Mens Parts. The Constitution of 
their Governments, which were chiefly Republican, obliged 
them likewise to study Oratory, as a likely way 
to rise in their several States, for which Reason, as amongst 
many Rivals, some grew very Excellent, so 
when their Liberty was taken away by the Macedonians, 
their Eloquence decayed along with it. The same Reasons 
may in his Opinion be assigned for the Rise and Decay 
of the Roman Eloquence and Poetry. Though in 
some sort of Composures, Histories for Example, where 
Oratory has but a Secondary share, he believes that the 
Moderns may have equalled the Ancients; and he thinks 
that the Memoirs of Philip Comines, and F. Paul's History 
of the Council of Trent, may be set against any of the 
Histories of the Ancients with which it can be proper 
to compare them. (Chap. 3.) 
 
This leads him to Examine Monsieur Perrault's Hypothesis, 
who asserts that Modern Eloquence, and Modern 
Poetry are preferrable to the Ancient: There he goes 
through the several Reasons which Monsieur Perrault 
brings to establish his Hypothesis, and concludes that 
[^p.267^] 
they are insufficient; particularly he seems to think it 
very hard Measure, that the Translations of the Pieces 
of Eloquence of the Ancients should be set against Original 
Pieces of the Moderns, since every Language has 
Beauties of its own, which can never be reached in another, 
though never so exact and elegant. (Chap. 4.) 
 
In the Fifth Chapter he considers Ancient and Modern 
Grammar, as it comes under the Cognizance of Criticks, 
or of Philosophers. For the first, which he calls Mechanical 
Grammar, he supposes that some Moderns have 
understood the Analogy of the Greek and Latin as well 
as any of the Ancients; and he thinks that Modern 
Tongues have been as critically scanned as any of the 
Ancient ones, especially English and French, which he 
particularly instances in. For Philosophical Grammar, 
he recommends Bishop Wilkin's Essay towards a Real 
Character and Philosophical Language, and the Third 
Book of Mr. Lock's Essay of Human Understanding, as 
Original Pieces that Antiquity has nothing to set against. 
(Chap. 5.) 
 
When he comes to compare Ancient and Modern Architecture, 
Statuary, and Painting, he abridges what 
Monsieur Perrault had said already upon the same Subjects 
in his Parallel of the Ancients and Moderns, wherein 
he gives the Moderns every where the Preference, 
without interposing his own Judgment. (Chap. 6.) 
 
After this he comes to enquire into Ancient and Modern 
Philosophy and Mathematicks; but before he speaks 
particularly of them, he examines Sir W.T.'s Hypothesis 
of the History of Learning step by step, against 
whose Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning, a great 
part of his Book seems to be levelled. Sir William 
Temple had exceedingly commended the Learning of 
Pythagoras and the Ancient Sages of Greece, as also that 
of the old Ægyptians, Chaldeans, Arabs, Indians, and 
Chineses. Our Author thinks that Pythagoras's chief 
[^p.268^] 
Excellency lay in Political Knowledge, and that though 
he was a better Mathematician and Philosopher than any 
Man of that Time, yet since he is commended chiefly 
for finding the XLVII Proposition of the First Book of 
Euclid, his Skill in those matters was, comparatively 
speaking, but very indifferent, which he also affirms of 
the Ancient Sages. (Chap. 7, 8.) 
 
From them he goes to the Egyptians, of whom he 
observes, That more may be challenged from them, than 
from other Nations, because their pretences to exactness 
in Recording Inventions and Traditions have been more 
considerable. Yet he thinks that their History could 
not be extraordinary, since both the Time when the 
Pyramids were built, and that when their great Hero 
Sesostris lived could never be determined by the Ancientest 
Writers no extant: That all the great Ancient 
Inventions in Geometry, though its Original be owing 
to them, are conveyed to us by Greeks as their own Inventions: 
That their Medicine was wholly built upon 
Astrological or Magical grounds: That their Pretences 
to the Philosophers Stone, seem to have been Father'd 
upon them by later Alchemists: That their skill in Anatomy 
was so small, that they believed that the Heart 
increased Annually two Drachms in weight till Men were 
50 years old, and afterwards decreased as gradually; 
for which reason, according to them, no Man could 
live above 100 Years: That with all their boasted Curiosity, 
they seem never to have sailed 200 Miles down 
the Nile into Æthiopia; since till about Plato's time, 
they could not give a clear Solution of the Annual Inundations 
of that wonderful River: And in short, That 
their greatest Skill lay in making Wise and Prudent 
Laws, which were worth going so far as the Greeks went 
to fetch them. (Chap. 9, 10.) 
 
He thinks that the Chaldean Learning was not so excellent 
as the Ægyptian; that the Assyrian History, which 
[^p.269^] 
we have from the Chaldeans, contradicts the Jewish: 
That the Chaldean Astrology was downright Knavery: 
And that for other things, had they been very considerable, 
there would have been more Memorials of them 
preserved. Tha Arabian Learning is, according to him, 
all in a manner owing to the Greeks, so that its Antiquity 
or Extent cannot here be alledged. (Chap. 11.) 
 
He believes the Chinese Natural Knowledge to be very 
inconsiderable, and their Speculative Skill in Medicine 
entirely Phantastical: To prove which he produces a 
long Citation out of an Old Chinese Book, called, Nuy-Kim, 
Printed by Cleyer in his Specimens of Chinese Physick. 
(Chap. 12.) 
 
He divides the Grecian Learning into Four Parts; Logick, 
Metaphysicks, Mathematicks, and Physicks. Logick, 
as it is the Art of Disputation and Method, is in his Opinion, 
to be ascribed to the Ancients; as it is the Art 
of Invention it is more owing to the Moderns, since the 
Methods of Invention which the Ancients made use of, 
seem to be entirely lost. Here he commends Des Cartes's 
Meditations, Tschirnhaus's Medica Mentis, and Mr. Lock's 
Essay of Humane Understanding. In Metaphysicks he thinks 
the Writings of Des Cartes and his Followers may be 
set agains all that the Platonists say upon those Subjects, 
though they of all the Ancients Discourse the most upon 
Spirits and Incorporeal Substances. (Chap. 13.) 
 
When he speaks of Ancient and Modern Mathematicks, 
he produces a Discourse of that Excellent Geometer, 
Mr. John Craig, who endeavours to prove that Modern 
Geometry is of infinitely larger extent than the Ancient; 
and that it has been enlarged by Methods in a 
good measure unknown to, or at least, not comparatively 
cultivated by the Ancients, which are, Algebra 
and the Method of Indivisibles; the particular Advantages 
of the former of which in improving Arithmetick 
and Geometry he does at large insist upon (Chap. 14). 
 
[^p.270^] 
Afterwards when he comes to Physicks, our Author 
observes that there are several Instruments and Arts, 
which are necessary Tools to a good Philosopher, that 
have been either invented, or very much improved by 
Moderns, for want of which it was impossible for the 
Ancients to understand Nature so well as it has since 
been understood. Among Instruments wholly Modern 
he reckons, (1.) Printing, which is useful to all Learned 
Men alike. (2.) Engraving upon Wood and Copper, 
which is peculiarly useful to all Writers of Natural History 
and Mathematicks. (3.) Telescopes, first invented 
by Zacharias Joannides, a Spectacle-Maker of Middleburgh 
about the Year 1590, whereby the Heavens 
have become more accessible to Modern Astronomers 
than they were to the Ancients. (4.) Microscopes, the 
Invention of the same Joannides, of infinite use in discovering 
the Texture of Minute Bodies. (5.) Baroscopes, 
by which the Comparative Gravitation of Air 
upon Terrestrial Bodies may be found out. (6.) Thermometers 
to adjust the variations of Heat and Cold. 
(7.) Air-pumps, very useful in discovering many hidden 
Properties of the Air. (8.) Pendulum Clocks, necessary 
for Astronomers in Measuring small Subdivisions 
of Time, when they make their Observations. (Chap. 15.) 
 
Amongst Preliminary Arts he reckons Chymistry and 
Anatomy: By Chymistry he understands the Art of Separating 
Bodies by Fire; and he observes that though 
the Ancients could refine Metals from their Dross to a 
good degree, yet for want of Aqua Fortis they could 
not part them from one another so well as they can at 
present. He says, Chymistry, properly so called, is 
mostly owing to the Arabs, and that the Greeks knew 
scarce any thing at all of it; but yet that the use of Chymical 
Preparations in Physick is almost entirely owing 
to the Physicians of this and the last Age, since the Time 
of Paracelsus. (Chap. 16). 
 
[^p.271^] 
Of Anatomy he says, That the Ancients Skill in it 
reached only to those Parts that are discoverable by the 
naked Eye, and even there not so far as the Moderns 
have carry'd it in any one Particular: That the Extent 
of the Ancients Knowledge in that matter may be certainly 
known from the Anatomical Discourses of Galen: 
That if we descend to Particulars, the Anatomy of the 
Brain was not known to any tolerable degree before 
Malpighius and Willis: That the Ancients knew little of 
the Texture of the Eye, in comparison of what may be 
found in the Writings of Dr. Briggs: That the Glands 
which supply it with moisture, are by no body so well 
described as by Monsieur Nuck: That the Ear, with its 
inner Cavities, was little known before Monsieur Du 
Verney: That the knowledge of the Texture of the 
Tongue is owing to Malpighius; of the Glands of the 
Mouth, Jaws, and Neck, to Wharton, Steno, and Nuck; 
and of the Lungs, to Malpighius: That the Primary 
use of the Lungs was wholly unknown to the Ancients, 
who had no Notion of the Circulation of the Blood; 
since all that can be collected from the Writings of Hippocrates, 
Plato, and Aristotle, is, that the Blood had a 
constant recurrent Motion through the Body, which 
they could not distinctly describe: That this Motion 
through the Veins to the right Ventricle of the Heart, 
thence through the Lungs into the left, and so through 
the Arteries over the whole Body till it meets again 
with the Veins, first called by Cæsalpinus the Circulation 
of the Blood, was first discovered by Servetus, 
then pursued somewhat further by Columbus and Cæsalpinus, 
and at last made perfectly Intelligible by Dr. Harvey, 
whose Discoveries were lately made compleat by 
Mons. Leuwenhoek: That the Texture of the Heart was 
first discovered by Dr. Lower, of the Coats of the Stomack 
by Dr. Willis, of the Fibres of the Intestines by 
Dr. Cole, of the Chyliferous Vessels by Assellius and 
[^p.272^] 
Pecquet, of the Lacteal Vessels in Women by Monsieur 
Nuck, and of the Liver by Malpighius: That the Ductus 
Pancreaticus was first discovered by Wirtsungus, and 
the Spleen and the Reins found to be Glandulous Bodies 
by Malpighius: That the Lympha and its Ducts were 
never thought of, till they were discovered by Bartholin, 
Rudbeck, and Jolliffe: That Dr. Havers found out 
Mucilage in the Joynts, with the Glands which preserve 
it: And lastly, That the Anatomy of Bruits has 
been as carefully examined as that of Men, of which he 
gives several Instances. (Chap. 17, 18, 19.) 
 
In Treating of Philosophy, he begins with Natural 
History, and with that of Elementary Bodies and Minerals 
as the simplest. He observes that the Ancients 
knew little of the Nature of Air; that though Aristotle 
believed it to gravitate, yet his Disciples so little understood 
him, that they asserted the quite contrary; that 
the Doctrine of its Spring is owing to our truly Noble 
Countryman Mr. Boyle, whose Histories of the most conspicuous 
qualities of Terrestrial Bodies have much enlarged 
that part of Natural History. In his Account of 
Minerals he instances in the Loadstone, whose Noblest 
Properties were Anciently unknown; and he enlarges 
upon their use, with the increase of Wealth and Knowledge, 
which thereby have accrued to these European 
Nations, in these two last Ages. (Chap. 20.) 
 
Of the Natural History of Plants he Observes, that 
all Ancient Descriptions are confused and lame, and in 
number very deficient: That nothing which they did 
can be compared with Gerhard's, Parkinson's, and Bauhines 
Herbals, much less with Mr. Ray's, who first drew 
up a Methodical History of all the Plants yet known. 
(Chap. 21.) 
 
Of Insects he Observes, That the Ancients only medled 
with the most Remarkable sorts, and there rarely 
took notice of any but the most conspicuous things: 
[^p.273^] 
So that all which Malpighius and Rhedi say concerning 
their Generation, all that is in the Writings of Goedartius 
and Swammerdam concerning the Time and Nature 
of their Transmutations, may be looked upon as wholly 
new. And as for Histories of larger Animals, he pretends 
that Willoughby's Histories of Birds and Fishes, Ray's 
Synopsis of Quadrupeds, besides a great many Modern 
Discourses upon particular Animals, are without comparison 
better than the Histories of Artistotle, Ælian, 
or Pliny. (Chap. 22.) 
 
Afterwards he inserts a Discourse written by that most 
excellent Astronomer Mr. Halley, concerning Ancient 
and Modern Astronomy and Opticks; who says, that the 
Ægyptian and Chaldean Astronomy was little worth in 
it self, and the Greek Astronomy not much better, if 
compared with the Modern: That Ptolemy's Hypothesis 
of the Planetary Motions cannot be set against Kepler's 
and Newton's; nor Hipparchus's Catalogue of the Fixt 
Stars against Tycho Brahe's and Herelius's: That the 
Ancients could know but little of Opticks, since they 
were so meanly skilled in Perspective; and of Dioptricks, 
they were wholly ignorant, since they had no Notion 
of the Properties of Refraction, which Des Cartes first 
reduced to a Science, (Chap. 23.) 
 
Of Musick he determines nothing positively, but seems 
to think that since the grounds of Musick have always 
been the same, and that the Moderns use more Gradations 
of Half-Notes and Quarter-Notes than the Ancients; 
and that the Symphonys of the Ancients were only Consorts 
of several Voices and Instruments to the same Part; 
that Modern Musick, considered as Art, is perfecter 
than the Ancient, which was so much extolled by those 
that heard it, because it was the most excellent they 
had ever heard, and so had a right to the greatest Commendations 
which they could give it. (Chap. 24.) 
 
[^p.274^] 
Of Medicks also he determines nothing, as to Ancient 
and Modern Methods of Practice, only allows Hippocrates 
to have been a very great Genius, perhaps not 
equalled by any Physician that have come since: Yet 
considering how much Botanicks, Chymistry, and Anatomy 
have been enlarged, he thinks that Modern Theories 
of Diseases are much more valuable, than Ancient 
ones, for want of those helps, could possibly be. (Chap. 25.) 
 
In speaking to Ancient and Modern Methods of Philosophizing, 
he gives the preference to the latter; because 
no Principles of Nature are there allowed, but what are 
in themselves intelligible; and the business of forming 
Parties is now in a manner out of doors, and Mathematical 
Reasonings are constantly urged as valid ways of 
Proof, in all Physical Enquiries where they can be brought 
in: Hereupon he takes occasion to enlarge upon the 
Design of the ROYAL SOCIETY, and hints at 
the great things which its Members have effected towards 
the compleating of Physical Knowledge (Ch. 26.) 
 
Having gone through those Sciences which lye equally 
open to Men of all Ages to make Discoveries in, he goes 
on to those which have their whole Foundation in Antiquity, 
wherein by consequence the Moderns seem to 
have no Pretence to a Comparison; such as Philology 
and Divinity. Yet he says, that if we consider how 
much Printing has altered the state of Learning, how 
wide a thing Antiquity is in all its compass, how many 
things rarely meeting in one man, are requisite to make 
a Man a through Critick; we ought to conclude, that 
though every Age of Antiquity knew it self better than 
we can pretend to know it, yet in the gross, the Scaligers, 
the Vossius's, the Ushers, the Seldens, the Bocharts, 
and such Modern Philologers have had a greater extent 
of Ancient Learning, than any single Man among the 
Ancients could possibly have (Chap. 27.) 
 
[^p.275^] 
And as to Divinity he says, That though the Scriptures 
and the Writings of the Ancient Fathers be the 
Foundations upon which every Divine ought to build; 
yet if we consider that the Text of the Bible it self by 
a familiar conversation with the Oriental Languages is 
now better understood: That Casuistical Knowledge lies 
as obvious now as ever it did: That the Art of Preaching 
is more Methodical, and by consequence more Instructive: 
That Controversies have been managed more 
nicely, and more exactly, we must allow Modern Divines 
to have been the better Workmen, though the Matter 
which both they and the Ancients have joyntly 
wrought upon, has been the same. (Chap. 28.) 
 
His last Chapter is employed about Answering some 
Reasons which Sir W. T. assigns for the decay of Learning; 
such as, (1.) Disputes in Religion; which in his 
Opinion have rather increased Knowledge than otherwise, 
since the Spirit of Opposition, when once raised, 
will shew it self in every thing as well as in those matters 
which first gave it Life. (2.) Want of Favour from 
Great Men, of which, according to him, there is not so 
much Reason to complain, considering that the French 
King, Q. Christina, and several others whom he there 
mentions, lived all of them in this Age. (3) Pedantry; 
which also he pretends to be in a manner quite Banisht 
out of the World. 
 
The whole Book seems to be designed for a Vindication 
of that sort of Learning, which it is the intention 
of the Royal Society to promote, for which Reason probably 
he took no Notice that he had the Honour to be a 
Member of that Body.
