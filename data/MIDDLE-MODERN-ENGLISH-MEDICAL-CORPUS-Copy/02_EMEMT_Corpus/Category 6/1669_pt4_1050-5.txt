Sir 
YOur last publisht Transactions N=o= 51. have administred 
the occasion, and the Candour, I know you possess, 
hath encouraged me to give you this trouble. In your enlarged 
accompt of D. Witties Answer to Hydrol. Chymica, p. 1039. 
l. 21. you say; This I had not here mentioned, but to introduce onr 
Authors weighty remark; That these waters loose all their virtue, 
yea their quant and bulk also, though in Glasses and under the Hermetick 
seal, if removed from the fountain-head &c. Now, Sir, 
'tis a truth, if not universally, yet generally known and assented 
to by unlearned as well as learned, that some sort of Medicinal 
[^p.1051^] 
waters loose their virtue, if remov'd to any considerable 
distance from their fountain head; but others do not, at least 
not so soon. To this last sort belong such, as are our Barnet, 
Epsham and Dullidge waters; to the other sort belong our 
Tunbridg, Astrap and [/1./] Stall-bridge-waters; 
and all such _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ike here or else where: And the 
common usage of the Sick, taken from the 
advise of their Physitians, and the Experience 
of all, in repairing to those respective 
places, sufficiently proues the common consent thereunto. 
 
But though the effect be so plain and manif_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]st, yet the cause 
thereof seems not to me so pl_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]inly discovered; and because you 
are pleased to your fo_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]e-cited words to subjoyne these; And even 
their quantity and bulk also, though in Glasses and vnder the 
Herm. Seal &c: I suppose, you intimate and offer, that the 
cause of the loss of their Medicinal vertues is upon the loss of 
their qua_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]tity and bu_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]k: which also you aptly strengthen by the 
authority of the fam_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]us Doctors, French, ab Heer, and Frambesarius; 
and then in a _[^ORIG. BLURRED^]arenthesis you put altogether, and cautiously 
say (doubtless thorough the loss of the Volatile Spirits) &c. 
And in the beginning of the very next paragraph you goe on 
thus; Whatever these Spirits be, that will neither endure to travel 
from the Place, nor will be confined in any bottle, nor under any seal 
&c. So that the sum of your Conjecture (for as other you propose 
it not) is, That this losse consists in the Avolation of some 
most subtle and penetrating Spirituous parts, not to be imprisoned 
by any inclosure imaginable, but will find their way out, and 
leave the waters bereft of virtue, and decreased in quantiy too, 
and (what more is) perhaps of their weight also, especially if 
they loose of thtir quantity. But to this last you modestly add, 
Here we want instruction, whether that decrease was as well of weight, 
as of bulk &. 
 
That this Conjecture of yours concerning the Cause of the 
loss of virtues in these waters carried from their Spring, may be 
true, I do not absolutely deny, but further acknowledge, that 
it is the sentiment of very many, if not all, Physitians and Naturalists, 
that have concern'd themselves with the consideration 
thereof; and I my self have entertained the very same 
[^p.1052^] [^Original misnumberd as p.1054.^] 
thoughts of it, and doe not now but suppositively relinquish 
them. But having lately, in reading Tachenius's Hippocr. Chymicus 
(newly recommended by your self in N=o=. 50. of your 
Transact.) found c. 16. somewhat relating to this matter; I 
began by the encouragement of his authority to resume some 
Conjectures touching the same, which I had, if not abandoned, 
yet kept supprest in silence, which indeed are of another 
kind, but how true I yet know not. Wherefore I thought, 
it might not be very un-accepable to you, if I desired you, 
publickely to give notice of these Conjectures, that the Learned 
may reason and find out the truth of them; whence may result 
no few nor very unuseful discovery's for the increas of knowledge, 
the benefit of mankind, and the glory of the Creator 
of all. In order thereunto I desire, you will propose these or 
such like Q_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]eries; 
 
1. Whether by Chymical researches it wes ever yet or c_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]n 
be found, that such waters as the above-said, ever yielded either 
a Vinous or an Acid, or any other sort of Spirits, that 
were eithet inflammable, or un-inflammable, or flying over the 
Helm from the fire. 
 
2. Whether all these sorts of Waters, when they are most 
closely stopt up, and so let stand, or conveyed to some distance, 
doe not let fall a sd_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]iment (most commonly) yellowish, or 
of some such colour, when they are become effæte in their 
vess_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ls. 
 
3. Whether, when they are let stand only, and not moved 
by carriage, they do not sooner become castrated, and sooner 
precipitate an Ochre to the bottom? 
 
4. Whether such an Ochre is not found in all their Spring-heads, 
and Streams also; but more in the Head than in the 
Streams, especially if issued there-from to a good distance. 
 
5. Whether it may not be found upon due Observation, that 
two Bottles of the said waters, whereof the one being indust_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ously 
stopped, the other left unstopt, and both equally permitted to 
stand still or equally moved, will not equally loose their virtues 
Medicall in the same space of time, and have the same precipitated 
sediment, and be of the same taste, colour, and alike diminisht 
in quantity, with divers others such like circ_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]mstances? 
 
[^p.1053^] [^Original misnumbered as p.1055.^] 
6. Whether two Vessels, diversified in their matter, and 
consequently in their parts, pores and figures of the whole (as 
e.g. a Glass-bottle and an Oxe-bladder, or any two such like) 
fill'd with such waters, will not yeild the like Phænomena in all 
circumstances, as in the 5th Query are mentioned? 
 
7. Whether it may be devised, how to prevent all precipitation 
of a sediment in the Waters vesseled up; and then to observe 
thereupon, whither their vertues would not be kept entire 
during such a prevention? 
 
8. Whether any Observer ever found the Waters enervated 
but found withall an Ochre, let fall to the bottom or sides of the 
containing vessel? 
 
9. To be brief, Whether the Phænomenon of loss of vertues 
in such Waters may by an Hypothesis of an intestine Precipitation 
of their parts, wherein those vertues consisted, be as well 
(if not better) explicated, than by the Hypothesis of an Avolation 
of Spirituous parts through all Vessels and closures 
whatsoever? 
 
Which Hypothesis that it may be the better weighed, I shall 
only exhibit it, and leave it to the Ingenious and Learned to 
conclude concerning it. 
 
First therefore it is generally received amongst most, especially 
the more polite, Chymical Authors and Students, That, if 
any Medical vertues be in Minerals or Metals, it consists in their 
Sulphurs; which are of a Volatile and Alcalisate property; especially 
when not intimately conmmix't with, or after commixtion 
perfectly freed from their Mercurial parts. 
 
Next, its as much received, even to become a Cymical Maxime, 
That Acids aud Alcaly's mutually operate upon one another 
to a satiety, to an abating, and (if circumstances correspond) 
to an utter amission of their former activities, and lastly to a 
production of a Tertium neutrum. 
 
Again they alike conclude, that Salts act best in a State of 
Solution, All which Premises thus concenter in this Hypothesis; 
 
That the Waters, which materially make some Springs, passing 
underground by the veine of some Mettal, which yet is 
in fieri, having first taken up of an Acide Salt which is in the 
Earth, thereby catcheth hold on the immature Sulphur of that 
[^p.1054^] [^Original misnumbered as p.1055.^] 
Mettal, and presently glides it along with it self to the Springs 
orifice, and from the moment of the Sulphur and Acide Salt's 
meeting and contact begins a mutual action and reaction upon one 
another which never ceaseth; till both are imperceptibly spent, and 
blended into a new Body, which then the water lets fall, an_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] we 
call an Earth, Ochre, or Sediment: After the production of 
which Ochre, the Medicinal vertues of the immature Sulphur 
is lockt up into the inseparable embraces of the A_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]ide Salt, 
and so is lost, or at least disappears. But this mutual action 
and reaction may last, till the Waters issue out of the Earth, 
and for some small time longer, and so long their Medical vertues 
are to be imparted, and no longer. 
 
This, Sir, is the Hypothesis of Tachenius (if I rightly apprehend 
him) which I send, not to have it Justle out the 
more received one, or any other that may be proposed; but 
that it may have its Tryall, and accordingly may live or dye. 
I could alledge more in its behalf, especially in the particular 
of such a Body, as we commonly call an Ochre; resulting from 
divers Experiments of Vitriol: but I have trespassed too much 
already to hope for pardon from any, but &c.
