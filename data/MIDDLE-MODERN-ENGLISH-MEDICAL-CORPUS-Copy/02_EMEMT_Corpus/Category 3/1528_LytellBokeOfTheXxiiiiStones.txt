[^f.A2r^] 
[}The fyrst Saarde. Capitulo .i.}] 
 
SAarde and Garnat/ 
and Almandines/ and 
Iargonce be all concreed 
togyther/ but Iargonce 
hath the vertue 
of these stones/ and it 
is the most fynest/ and 
it gyueth a gentell red 
colour/ and maketh a man mery and glad/ 
and kepeth hym longe yonge/ and in great 
trouth/ and maketh a man to forget his co~trarye. 
And also it stau~cheth/ blode and he 
that beryth it vpon hym/ nedeth nat to 
drede to touche no euyll vermyn. And also 
he may passe all parellous places sewrely 
without daunger/ and in what place that 
he cometh to/ to be lodged in/ he shall be 
gladly receyued & haue good chere/ And 
any thyng that he asketh that is of reason 
shall nat be denyed hym/ nor warned hym. 
 
[}The Topace. Cap~ .ij.}] 
 
Topace is of a yelowe colour/ & there be 
of dyuers maners of Oryent/ & of Arabye/ 
[^f.A2v^]

cooleth a man/ and healeth hym of a 
syckenesse that is called the Fye in fre~che/ 
and who so euer haue this fye/ and serue 
it about with a Topace stone/ it shall neuer 
growe more/ a Topace draweth in se~blau~ce 
to the moone: for whan the moone 
is fowle and rayny/ this sayd stone is the 
more troublous/ and derker of his colour. 
And whan the moone is fayre & clere/ this 
stone is the more clerer/ & of more gentyll 
colour. And who so euer beryth this stone 
vpon hym/ he shall loue the better to be 
chaste of his body/ and reme~bre hym selfe 
to beholde and loke vp to the celestiall Reame 
of heuen. This stone is of the colour 
and aszur/ a kynge ought to beholde and 
loke often on this Topace/ for it gyueth 
good remembraunce to hym that kepeth 
it/ to thynke on the kindgome of heue~ that 
neuer shall fayle/ a Topace is best as he 
is fou~de and groweth/ but he is nat so plesaunt/ 
and therfore he is neuer the better 
to be polisshed/ but yet he leseth nat his 
vertue: nor his strength/ a Topace ought 
to be set in golde. 
 
[}The Emeraude. Cap~ .iij.}] 
 
[^f.A3r^] 
An Emeraude passeth all grene thynges 
of grenesse/ The fynest Emeraudes

that it shall nat empeyre in hym that hath

and maketh a man to be of temperate 
wordes/ and heleth a man of the syckenesse 
of the herte/ And also it is passyng 
good agaynste the Gowte/ & agaynst tempestes/ 
& agaynst longe syckenesse: who so 
bereth an Emeraude vpon hym/ it shall 
cause hym to lyue in clennesse/ and in clene 
lyfe/ and hate to speke vnclenly and vyllonously/ 
and be the better wyllyd to contynewe 
hym/ and maynteyne him selfe fayre 
& clene/ and to thynke on his owne soule/ 
and the more to loue clene & honest sportes 
and games/ & good werkes. For god hym 
selfe gaue to this said stone/ these vertues.

in the forhede/ And they seke & fynde these 
Emeraudes/ and when they go for them/ 
they be all armed/ and so they seke the said 
stones in the sayd floode of Paradyse terrester/ 
and there they fynde them. And the 
said Gryffo~s flye all about and seke these 
sayde folkes/ that haue but one iye in the 
forhede: and they do theyr power to take 
away the stones fro the~/ for they be ryght 
fearse & angry with them/ that they bere 
them away/ but these sayd folkes be so armed/ 
that the sayde fowle Gryffons may 
do them no harme. That Emeraude that 
is most clennest and passynge grene/ he is 
moost gentyll/ precyous and best.

the Rubye is put in/ it shall heale hym/ & 
he that loketh & beholdeth this stone/ and 
is in ferme and good byleue/ it comforteth 
hym: and he shall forget his contarye/ by 
the vertue that god hath put in this stone. 
And also this sayde stone/ fedeth a mans 
syght/ and comforteth the hert & the body 
and getteth a man good lordshyp aboue

also besyde the sayd Rocke/ be founde dyuers 
Saphyrs but they be nat so moch of

man from poyson: and from prysonynge. 
And if a man be in pryson it helpeth hym

he is in. And also his setters if he be settred/ 
& he be in good byleue to god warde 
he shalbe delyuerde by the grace and vertue 
that god hath gyuen to the sayde Saphyr. 
And also the Saphyr is good to accorde 
men togyther/ if they be at debate 
And also for to vndo wychecraftes and Sorserye 
Also the Saphyr is good for all boches/

[^f.A5r^] 
drynke that water/ & it shall put away all 
the brennynge heate of a mans body/ and 
make hym to tremble/ & sease all aches & 
dolours. And also it healeth a man of the 
Iannesse: and also the Saphyr when it is 
put to a mans iye/ it breketh the webbe/ & 
putteth away the fylth/ & make a bodyes 
iyen fayre & clere. And god conceylles the 
said Saphyr stone/ & kepeth it in clennesse 
and also god gyueth hym wytte/ & great 
vnderstandynge. And to knowe the Saphyr 
it is lyke the colour of the Fyrmament/ 
but it is so beauteous in the syght/ 
that it is lyke blewe colour. And who so

hym alway in goodnesse/ and goodnesse 
cometh alway vnto hym.
