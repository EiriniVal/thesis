[}THE 
QUEENS CABINET 
OPENED. 
OR 
The Pearl of Practice. 
Accurate, Physical and Chyrurgical 
RECEIPTS.}] 
 
[}Dr. Butlers Preservative against the Plague.}] 
 
TAke Wood Sorrel, and pick it 
from the stalk, and pound it very 
well in a stone Mortar; then 
take to every pound of beaten 
Sorrel a pound of Sugar finely beaten, and 
two ounces of Mithridate, beat them very 
well together, and put them in pots for your 
use; take every morning before and after 
the infection for some time together of this 
Conserve, as much as a Walnut. 
 
[^p.2^] 
[}Dr. Butlers Cordial Water.}] 
 
TAke Pimpernel, Carduus, Angelica, 
Scordium, Scabious, Dragon, and still 
these severally in a Rose-Still; and when 
you have a pint of the water of every of 
these sorts of Herbs, then mingle all these 
together very well, and dissolve in it half a 
pound of Venice Treacle, then still all these 
together, and mingle the stronger water 
with the small; six spoonfuls of this water 
made blood warm, given to one sick of the 
Plague, driveth all venome from the heart. 
It is excellent, so used, for the small Pox, 
or for any Pestilent Feaver.

of the Oak, and Sena, of 
each four ounces, Carraway seed, and Anniseed, 
of each half an ounce, Liquorish two 
ounces, Maidenhair, and Agrimony, of each 
one little handful, Scurvey half a bushel; 
beat all these grosly, and put them into a 
course Canvas bag, and hang it into three 
gallons of strong Ale; when it is three days 
old drink it. 
 
[^p.3^] 
[}Dr. Giffords Amber Pills for a Consumption.}] 
 
TAke of Venice Turpentine one ounce 
washed, and six grains of the Powder 
of white Amber, mix them together, and 
set them in a clean pot upon Embers, and 
let it not stand too hot; to try whether it 
be enough, take a drop, and let it cool; 
if after it is cold it be stiff, and will not 
cleave to the finger, it is enough: then 
take of the Powders of Pearl, White Amber, 
and Coral, of each a quantity, as a 
quarter of an ounce of the inner bark of 
an Oak, a quarter of an ounce of Cinnamon 
and Nutmegs, of each as much, and three 
ounces of hard white Sugar; make all these 
into a powder, and seeth them, and put the 
Pills into them; before you take them, you 
must be well purged, after which you must 
take three of the aforesaid Pills wrapped up 
in the powder, what else you will, and in the 
morning take the yolk of a new laid Egg 
warmed a little, and put into it as much of 
the Powder as will lye on a shilling, and 
sup it off; let this be used some time together, 
and there will be great benefit found 
by it. 
 
[^p.4^]

earthen pan for two dayes, stirring it often, 
then strain it, and with four pound of powder 
Sugar (or two pound if you mean not 
to keep it long) boyl it to a Syrup, then 
take it off, and when it is almost cold, put 
to it Diamargaritum Frigidum one dram 
and a half, Diambra four scruples. Take 
thereof a spoonful or two for many mornings 
together, and when you awake in the night, 
if there be cause; you may also add 
to some part of it Saffron to make it more 
Cordial, by putting some powder of Saffron 
in a linnen cloth tyed up, and so milking it 
out into the syrup, let the substance thereof 
remain in the cloth, and take thereof 
sometimes. Approved. 
 
[^p.5^] 
[}A Cordial Electuary for stuffing of the Stomach, 
or shortness of breath.}] 
 
TAke a pint of the best Honey, set it on 
the fire, and scum it clean, then put to 
it a bundle of Hysop bruised small before 
you tie it up; let it boyl well till the Honey 
taste of the Hysop, then strain out the Honey

Angelica Root, the weight of sixpence, 
powder of Elecampane root, the weight of 
six pence, Ginger and Pepper, of each the

pour all into a clean gally-pot, stirring it 
always till it be through cold, and keep it 
close covered for your use. When any are 
troubled with stuffing at the stomach, or 
shortness of breath, let them take of this 
Electuary, with a bruised Liquorish stick, 
and they shall sensibly find much good by it. 
This was Queen Elizabeths Electuary for 
these infirmities. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}Mr. Covets Medicine for the Palsie.}] 
 
TAke a pint of the strongest Mustard, 
set it in an Oven for two or three times, 
till it be as thick as a hasty pudding, the Oven 
must not be too hot to burn it: then 
set it on a chafindish of coles till it be dry 
enough to make into powder. Take half 
an ounce of Betony powder, and mix it with 
the said powder, and sweeten it with Sugar-candy 
to your taste. Take of this every

[}A receipt to help Digestion.}] 
 
TAke two quarts of small Ale, put to it 
red Mints one handful, as much of

bottle, stop it close with a strong cork, and 
shake it oft. After it hath stood ten dayes, 
pass it through a Jelly bag, and give two or 
three spoonfuls of it for a great Cordial. 
This way you may also make Lavender 
Wine for the Palsie, and other Diseases. 
 
[}Dr. Bassa an Italian. An approued Receipt to 
break the Stone in the Kidneys.}] 
 
IN the Month of May distill Cowdung, 
then take two live Hares, and strangle 
them in their blood; then take the one of 
them, and put it into an earthen vessel of 
pot, and cover it well with a mortar made 
of Horsedung and Hay, and bake it in an 
Oven with houshold bread, and set it still in 
an Oven two or three dayes, baking it anew 
with any thing, untill the Hare be baked or 
dryed to powder; then beat it well, and 
keep it for your use. The other Hare you 
must flea, and take out the guts only; then 
distill all the rest, and keep this water: then 
take at the new and full of the Moon, or any 
other time, three mornings together as 
much of this powder as will lie on a sixpence, 
with two spoonfuls of each water, and it will 
break any Stone in the Kidneys. 
 
[^p.8^] 
[}Dr. Bassa's Remedy for a bloody Vrine, or to 
Break a stone in the Bladder.}] 
 
Take the water of distilled Saxifrage, 
Coriander, Parsley and cod of Broom 
when they be green, the berries of white 
Thorn stilled when they be ripe; they must 
be stamped stones and all, and then distilled; 
the green hulls of Walnuts when they be 
ripe stilled, Raisins of the Sun stilled; every 
one of these waters must be stilled by it self. 
Then take an equal quantity of each, as a 
pint of Aqua spirita; put them all together, 
and still them in an ordinary still, or 
in B. after scum the water nine or ten days: 
and take of this water for ten or fifteen 
dayes, five or six spoonfuls at a time in the 
morning fasting, and use to take it after a 
day or two once in a mouth. 
 
[}Syrup of Turnips.}] 
 
First bake the Turnips in a pot with 
houshold-bread, then press out the Liquor 
between two platters; put a pint of 
this Liquor to half a pint of Hysop-water, 
and as much brown Sugar-candy as will 
sweeten it; and boyl it to the consistence 
[^p.9^] 
of a Syrup. It is very good for a Cold or 
Consumption. 
 
[}Syrup of Citron peels.}] 
 
TAke the outermost fresh peels of Citrons 
cut in small pieces, and pour 
on them two quarts of water, then wring 
it through a cloth; put to the Liquor one 
pound of powder Sugar, boyl it to a Syrup, 
and when it is sodden, put four grains of 
Musk to it, dissolved in Damask Rose-water. 
This Syrup cooleth not. It defendeth from 
the Plague. 
 
[}A Cordial Syrup to cleanse the blood, open 
Obstructions, prevent a Consumption, &c.}] 
 
Take Rosemary flowers, Betony, Clove-gilly-flowers, 
Borrage, Broom, Cowslip 
flowers, red Rose leaves, Melilot, Comfrey, 
Clary, Pimpernel-flowers, of each two

all these into six quarts of Claret wine, 
put to it fourteen pound of ripe Elder-berries, 
make the Wine scalding hot, then put 
in the flowers, Currans, and Elder-berries, 
cover the pot, and paste it very close, set it 
in a Kettle of warm water to infuse forty 
[^p.10^] 
eight hours, till the vertue of the ingredients 
be all drawn out, then press it out hard, and 
put to every pint of the liquor one pound 
and three quarters of powder sugar, boyl 
and scum it till you find the syrup thick enough; 
when it is cold, bottle it, and keep it 
for your use. Take two spoonfuls in a morning, 
and so much in the afternoon, fasting 
two hours after it. 
 
[}A medicine for a Dropsie, approved by the 
Lady Hobby, who was cured her self by it.}] 
 
TAke Caraways, Smallage, Thime, Hysop, 
Watercresses, Pennyroyal, Nettle 
tops, Calamint, Elecampane roots, of

pounds, boyl them in six quarts of running

Sack, Liquorish twelve ounces, sweet Fennel-seed 
one ounce bruised, and a quarter of 
an ounce of Cummin-seed bruised; boyl all 
these above half an hour, then strain it, and 
keep it for your use, nine spoonfuls in the 
morning fasting, and as much at three or 
four a clock in the afternoon, use it for some

[^p.11^] 
[}Dr. Adrian Gilberts most Soveraign Cordial 
Water.}]

roots, Elecampany roots, Set-Wall 
roots, green Pennyroyal, Comfrey blossoms 
and leaves, Juniper berries, of each a pound; 
Balm, Carduus Benedictus, Dragon, Feaverfew, 
Wormwood, of each two pounds; 
steep all these in the lees of strong pure venient 
Clarret wine for nine dayes, every day 
twice turning them to mingle them well in 
the Lees, then distill them in a Limbeck 
with a read clear head, with two pound of 
shaved Harts-horn, and Ivory, twelve ounces; 
draw as long of it as you may in several 
pottle glasses: the first is accounted the 
best and uncompounded, and the perfectest 
against the Plague, spotted Feavers, and 
small Pox, ordinary Feavers, divers times 
experienced by my self, either to prevent, 
or in the time of these sicknesses. If you 
[^p.12^] 
will compound it because the water hath an 
ill taste, then take the first gallon of the 
water, and mix it with a pottle of the best 
Malaga Sack, and put into them three 
pounds of Raisins solis stoned, Figs one 
pound and a half, the flowers of Clove-gilly-flowers, 
Cowslips and Marigolds, blue 
Violets, of each two pound, red Rose-buds 
one pound, Ambergreece, Bezoar stone, 
clarified Sugar, Anniseeds, Liquorish, and 
what else you please. 
 
These are Adrian Gilberts Receipts, having 
had experience of them most constantly 
sure. The uncompounded Water is 
the more excellent: and if in time of infection 
one take two spoonfuls of it in good 
Beer or white-Wine he may safely walk 
from danger by the leave of God. If any 
of the former Diseases attach any person, 
then he must take four ounces the first 
water, and mix therewith either the Syrups 
of Violets, Clove-gilly-flowers, or Angelica, 
as the Disease is: one spoonful of the Syrup 
is sufficient for four ouncess of the water. 
So take it three time. 
 
[^p.13^] 
[}For a swoln face.}] 
 
Take Oyl of Elder and Plantain water, 
of each one ounce, beat them well together,

the Sun stoned, and figs sliced, of each 
one pound, Dates stoned and cut small half 
a pound, Rosemary flowers, wild Time, 
Spearming of each one handful, Organs or 
wild Marjoram, Bugeloss, Pimpinel, of

fire, put into the Receiver a quarter of a 
pound of brown Sugarcandy beaten small, 
four grains of Amber-greece, forty grains 
of prepared Pearl, and half a book of leaf 
[^p.14^] 
gold cut very small; you must mingle the 
strong water with the small, and let the Patient 
take two spoonfuls of it in the morning 
and as much at going to bed.

TAke three spoonfuls of Mint-water, and

spoonful thereof; especially when he or she 
goeth to bed.

and to help Digestion.}] 
 
TAke pure searced Sugar two ounces 
and wet it with the Spirit of Wormwood; 
then take a little Gum Tragacanth

three-pence; lay them upon plates, and dry 
them gently in an Oven, and keep them in

and roots, red Mints, of each one

three ounces of Mithridate or Treacle, and

and keep the first and second waters by 
themselves; and when there comes no more 
by distilling, put more Wine into the Pot 
upon the same stuff and distill it again and 
you shall have another good water. This 
water must be kept in a double glass close 
stopped very carefully. It is good against 
many infirmities, as the Dropsie, Palsie, Ague, 
Sweating, Spleen, Worms, Yellow and 
Black Jaundies; it strengthneth the Spirits, 
Brain, Heart, Liver and Stomach. Take 
two or three spoonfuls when need is by it

cure of the Plague, doth highly commend it
