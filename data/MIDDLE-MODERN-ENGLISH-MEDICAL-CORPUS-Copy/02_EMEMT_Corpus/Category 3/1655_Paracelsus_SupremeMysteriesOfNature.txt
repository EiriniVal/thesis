[}The Prologue.}] 
 
IT is without doubt, that 
many will be much ravished 
with admiration, 
when they see these 
my Writings brought 
into the light, because 
of the admirable effects 
& vertues which 
are found in Metals, being first rightly and 
[^p.92^] 
duly prepared with the hand and art: 
which among many people, are held and 
accounted to be superstitious and wicked 
operations, and against nature; that they 
are idolatrous operations, and that the 
help of the Devil is used to bring them to 
perfection. They say, How can it be possible, 
that Metals being engraven upon 
only with Characters, Letters and Words, 
should have any such power, unless they 
were prepared through the Craft and Assistance 
of the Devil? To these we Answer, 
I hear you give Credit to them, and 
do believe that they have power and virtue, 
being prepared by the help of the Devil, 
and do operate through him; And 
are you not able also to believe that God, 
who is the Creator of the whole Work of 
Nature, hath as much power in Heaven, 
and also that he giveth power and virtue 
to those operations in Metals, Herbs, 
Roots, Stones, and such like things? But 
in your judgment you seem to make the 
Devil more wise and powerful, than the 
only Omnipotent Lord God, who of his 
great Mercy, hath Created all Metals, 
Herbs, Roots, Stones, and all things 
whatsoever, that live, or move, in, or 
upon the Earth, Water and Air; and hath 
[^p.93^] 
endued them with their several degrees of 
virtue, for the benefit and use of mankind: 
It is also most certain, and approved by experience 
evidently, That the Changes and 
Mutations of time, have great and powerful 
strength and operation; and that 
chiefly in Metals, which are made in a certain 
determinate time, as it is manifest to 
many, and very well known to us by sundry 
experiences. No man likewise can 
teach that Metals are dead substances, or 
do want life; seeing their oyls, salt, sulphur, 
and quintessence are the greatest Preservatives, 
and have the greates strength 
and virtue to restore and preserve the life 
of man, before all other Simples, as we 
shall teach in all our Remedies assigned 
thereunto: Certainly if they had not life, 
how could they help Diseases, and restore 
the decayed Members of the Body, by putting 
life, and stirring up corporal vegetation 
in them: as in Contractures, the 
Stone, Small-pox, Dropsie, Falling-sickness, 
Phrenzy, Gout, and several other 
Diseases, which for brevities sake I omit to 
mention. Therefore I say, That Metals, 
Stones, Roots, Herbs, and all other Fruits 
have life in them, though of divers kinds, 
according to their Creation and growth, 
[^p.94^] 
and the due observation of the time contingent 
thereunto. For the times have 
in them singular power and virtue; which 
manifestly appeareth, and may be proved 
by sundry Arguments, which we shall not 
here produce, since they are so commonly 
known. For it is not our intent here to 
treat of things that are so cleerly known; 
but of more weighty and undiscerned secrets, 
which to sence seem contrary. 
 
Characters, Letters, and Signes, &c. 
have several virtues and operations; 
wherewith also the nature of Metals, the 
condition of Heaven, and the influence of 
the Planets, with their operations, and the 
significations and proprieties of Characters, 
Signes, and Letters, and the observation 
of the times, do concur and agree 
together. Who can object that these Signs 
and Seals have not their virtue and operations, 
one for infirmities in the head, being 
prepared in his time; another for the 
sight; another for gravel in the Reins and 
Stone, &c. but every one is to be prepared 
in his own proper time, and helpeth 
such and such infirmities, and no other; as 
drink is to be taken within the body, and 
not otherwise: but all this is to be done 
by means, by the help and assistance of the 
[^p.95^] 
Father of all Medicines, our Lord Jesus 
Christ, our only Savior. 
 
But if any one shall object, that Words 
and Characters have no virtue; and say as 
well as others, That they are of no more 
power than a bare Mark, or naked Cross 
or Signe; Also, that [^GREEK OMITTED^], hath no 
more power in the Greek tongue, than in 
the German, but only signifies the death 
of a Serpent, or some such thing: Let him 
tell me, who believeth such things, from 
whence it comes to pass, That Serpents in 
Helvetia, or Suevia, do understand these 
Greek words, Osii, osija, osii; since the 
Greek tongue is not so vulgar in those 
Countries, that venemous worms should 
understand it, or in time learn it? How 
should they come to understand them, or 
in what Universitie have they learned 
them, that as soon as ever they hear these 
words, they will immediately stop their 
eares with their tayles, that they may not 
hear them again? For no sooner do they 
hear these words, but immediately they 
lie still, contrary to their natures, not hurting, 
or offering to bite or cast any venome 
at any man; and afterwards if they hear 
any man to approach towards them, they 
suddenly fly into their holes. If thou dost 
[^p.96^] 
say that nature doth effect this, it is the 
same which I did expect thou shouldest 
answer: but if Nature worketh this upon a 
Serpent, why doth she not the same among 
all other Creatures? But if you should 
say, That the noise of the mans voice effecteth 
it, and that thereby the Serpents 
are terrified and stupified; or that it is 
done by any power in man; why then 
do they not in the same manner lie still 
when a man maketh a far greater noise, either 
crying out, or dischargeth a Gun, or 
the like? 
 
Characters and Seals have likewise in 
them wonderful virtue, which is not at all 
contrary to nature, or superstitious: Also, 
if you say that words are of no effect, 
but as the bare voice of men; I say on the 
contrary, if you write the same words in 
Parchment, or Paper, in a selected time, 
and put it upon a Serpent that is taken, in 
what manner you will, he will remain and 
lie still, as if you had spoken the same 
words. 
 
Neither is it any wonder, that Medicines 
can help men not taken into the body, 
but only hanged about the neck as Seals: 
For it is common to the Bladder with 
Cantharides, That it turneth his Urine 
[^p.97^] 
into Blood, that holdeth Cantharides 
close in his hand, the Bladder holding the 
Urine, and containing it that it cannot 
pass out of the Body, the hand being held 
far from the Body. 
 
Some Creatures do retain the same virtue 
after they are dead, as I prove by the 
Bird called the Kings Fisher, whose skin 
being taken off from his carcase, and being 
dried, and hanged up upon a nail, will cast 
his feathers many years, and new ones will 
grow again; and that not only for one or 
two yeers, but many yeers one after another. 
 
But if you further enquire, out of what 
Author or Writer I read of these virtues, 
or where I learned such experience; I answer 
you Sophisters and Contemners of 
the Gifts of God, that very Nature her 
self demonstrated before your eyes, doth 
far excel all the Authors and Writers of 
the world. I pray tell me which of your 
Authors of Writers taught the Bear, when 
his fight is dimmed by reason of the abundance 
and superfluity of his blood, to go 
to a stall of Bees, which by their stinging 
him, pierce his skin, and cause an effusion 
of the superfluous blood? What Physitian 
prescribed the herb Dittany to be medicine 
[^p.98^] 
for the Hart? or who taught the Serpent 
the virtue of Briony and Dragonwort? 
who taught the Dog to take Grass 
for his Cordial and Purge? And who 
prescribed the salt Sea-water to the Stork 
for a Clyster? Did you teach this knowledge 
to them? or do not they teach you? 
The same might I speak of infinite other 
Animals, that know naturally the Cure of 
their own Diseases. What! Have the 
Bruit-beasts taught the Medicinal Art? 
If you say, It's a Natural instinct, and that 
Nature teacheth them, so say I too. If 
Nature hath infused so much reason into 
Bruit-beasts, how much more should 
men learn thereby, who are made according 
to the Image of God, the Creator of 
all things; and are indued with reason 
from God, to consider and contemplate 
such things? 
 
Also to say that things ourwardly applied, 
and not substantially entring into 
the body, cannot Cure any Diseases, is 
false: For the Sun, which giveth us light, 
warmth, splendor, and infuseth life into 
all things, penetrateth into the most occult 
and close Mansions of the Earth; and 
doth vivifie and quicken all things that lie 
under the earth, even to the centre thereof. 
 
[^p.99^] 
For who can deny that in Spring-time, 
especially, the Sun penetrateth into the 
most secret places of the earth, giving 
heat and warmth thereunto, when it shines 
only upon the upper part thereof? From 
whence the roots of all things therein receive 
juyce, strength, and life? and why 
therefore may not the splendor of Nature, 
and the influences of the Heavens, Stars, 
Planets, and other means which we use to 
extract out of Metals, Herbs, Stones, and 
such like things, give their virtue into the 
bodies of men, and penetrate into the inner 
and private members thereof? as into 
the Nervs, Veins, and other internal Defects 
lurking in the flesh and blood of 
men, and have been there a long time 
growing. Diseases, Infirmities, and Accidents, 
are divers; so likewise are the 
several Cures thereof to be opposed to 
them according to their qualities, in their 
peculiar dayes and times: Against which 
also, Metals do best of all help; being 
prepared and used in due time and means: 
As if I should undertake to Cure the Leprosie 
with Gold; what should hinder 
but that an Oyl made thereof may Cure it 
by Unction? Also, if I should anoint the 
Small Pox with Oyl of Mercury, do you 
[^p.100^] 
think I am able to Cure them with this 
Mercury? without doubt; especially if I 
observe a fitting time for this purpose, 
without which last means, all anointings 
are in vain, although the sick were bathed 
in Oyl of Mercury: But in such Diseases 
where the Mercurial medicines are not sufficient, 
we ought then to use other remedies: 
which unless I should do, having a 
due respect to the observation of time, not 
only the Unctions, and all labor besides, 
will be in vain and fruitless, but they will 
bring the Patient into a worse condition: 
for it is most certain, that Diseases come to 
men for the most part from the power and 
influences of the Stars upon the bodies of 
men, yet not so suddenly that the same can 
presently be perceived, like a stripe, or the 
Falling-sickness. But they do encrease in 
process of time by little and little as it were 
a distillation, as oyl causeth water to wax 
fat by drops falling into it. A man may also 
perceive his own defects, by the shrinking 
or decaying of his Members, loss of 
Appetite to meat and drink, pain, &c. according 
to the condition and property of 
every Disease, the operations of the Stars, 
and the accidents by the Air, prepared and 
attracted upon us.

Of the Mysteries of the Signes 
of the Zodiack: 
 
Being the Magnetical and Sympathetical 
Cure of Diseases, as they 
are appropriated under the 
Twelve Signes ruling the parts 
of the Body.}] 
 
[}CHAP. I.}] 
 
[}Of the Common Griefs of the Head.}] 
 
THe Common Diseases and Pains 
of the Head are various: Some 
proceed from our own proper 
petulancy, through the excess 
of meat and drink; others come 
from evil vapors ascending from 
the Stomach to the Head, and they proceed from 
[^p.102^] 
several Causes, which in this place we intend 
not to treat of; but only of the more grievous 
Diseases of the Head, which follow. 
 
[}CHAP. II.}] 
 
[}Of the Falling-Evil.}] 
 
THe first thing to be taken notice of in this 
Disease, is the signs of the Falling; whether 
they happen at certain equal times, months, 
dayes, and hours, and how often; or whether 
they be unequal, happening at divers times; and 
whether a little before they fall, the Patients do 
use to shake and stagger a little, or whether they 
fall to the ground suddenly, and unawares: which 
being perceived, if they fall at certain times and 
hours, then the Disease doth not take them so 
suddenly; neither do they presently fall. But if 
it come at unequal times and hours, the contrary 
will be seen to happen; to wit, the falling 
comes upon them unawares. The first kind, to 
wit, when there is little shaking and staggering 
before the fall, is mortal: But if they perceive 
the fall before it come, the Disease is accounted 
not to be so dangerous, but more Curable; which 
proceedeth not from Nature, as the first; nor is 
not common therewith, wherfore it less weakeneth: 
The first brings Phrensie, and Madness; but 
the other is a falling Disease. The Cure of these, 
is thus; 
 
[^p.103^] 
First, Consider in what day, and what hour he 
Fell the last time, and write it: then see what 
Planet rules that hour; also the sign and degree 
of the Patient are to be known. 
 
Then the yeers of the Patient are to be numbred, 
and his Sex, which also keep noted in writing; 
then give this Medicine every day in the 
morning to drink; which followes, 
 
+R of the Spirit of Vitriol, Quintessence of Antimony, 
each 5 drops. Quintessence of 
Pearle, 4 drops. 
 
Give all these in the morning to the Patient 
to drink in a little draught of Rose-water, and 
let him fast four hours afterwards: Let him use 
this proceeding by the space of 29 dayes; and in 
the mean time, prepare the Lamen following, 
made after this manner, 
 
+R of pure Gold, +o +s and when the Moon 
comes to the 12 degree of Cancer, then lignifie 
the Gold in an Earthen-pot, and then let it be 
poured out into pure clean water. Afterwards 
mark when there comes a Conjunction of two 
Planets in the Heavens, and at that time precisely 
melt again this Gold, and in the point of the 
Conjunction, poure in +o +s of the most perfect 
and fine [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^], and that there may be an equal mixture 
of the [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] and [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. When this matter is poured out, 
and cold, make it into a Plate, that it may be 
four fingers bredth on both sides; then cut it into 
the form of a triangle, as appears in this figure. 
 
[^p.104^] 
[^Illustration of a triangle omitted.^] 
 
Heat this Lamen 
very hot 
in the fire, and 
then let it rest 
until you find 
the Moon in 
the same signe 
& degree that 
she was in at 
the time of the 
coming of the 
last fit before; 
and in the same hour, carve and ingrave these 
Signs and Characters, beginning with the Letters 
as they are set uppermost, in the Lamen of Gold 
and Silver. And you must make haste, that the 
Figures and Marks be all made and finished in 
the same hour, or else all your labor is in vain. 
The signe of the Planet of the hour in which the 
Fit of the Disease fell, is first to be engraven in 
the middle of the Lamen, as you may see it is in 
this foregoing Figure, which was made for James 
Seitz, Bishop of Salisburgh, now living; who fell 
in the hour of [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^]: Make the rest of the Signes as 
you see in the Figure, only this excepted, that for 
a Woman, instead thereof you shall put this Character [^Two figures omitted.^]: 
and under the other the Age 
of the Patient, as in the Figure you 
shall see 34, so many yeers old was 
the said James Seitz. Therefore the 
number of yeers is to be written to 
every Disease according to the Age 
of the Patient 
 
[^p.105^] 
The Figure being now prepared according to 
the directions; after a Fit cometh, command 
that his Hair be shaven off from the Crown of 
his Head, according to the Latitude of the Lamen: 
Then presently where he fell and lieth, 
with art and industry pour some of the Secret before 
prescribed into his mouth, and so hold him 
that it may descend into his Stomach; then 
forthwith apply the Lamen to the place shaven, 
so that the Sculpture may touch the naked flesh, 
and let it be bound on that it fall not off; which 
being done, let the Patient be carried to some 
place where he may quietly sleep. And after that 
Fall, without doubt he will never Fall more, although 
he hath had the Disease 30 yeers: But 
let him alwayes wear the Lamen about his neck, 
and shave his Hair at every Months end, in the 
same place where they were first shaven. 
 
[}CHAP. III.}] 
 
[}Some other Figures to Preserve the Sight.}] 
 
MAke thee a round Lamen of the best Lead 
in the hour of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], the [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] being in the Signe 
of [^Symbol of Aries omitted.^], and in the same hour; to wit, in the hour 
of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], engrave the Signes and Letters which you 
see written in the following Figure: Afterwards 
in the hour of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] make a Copper Lamen of the 
same Quantity and Form as the Leaden one; 
when [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] is in the signe [^Symbol of Capricorn omitted.^], the Characters which 
[^p.106^] 
you see in the Figure, are to be engraven. And 
then both Figures are to be kept and preserved 
so long until [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] comes into Conjunction with [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^]: 
and then in the point of the Conjunction both 
the Figures are to be conjoyned together so, that 
the Characters and Signes may mutually touch 
one another; then close them fast with Wax, that 
they receive no moisture, and sew them up in a 
piece of Silk, and hang it about the Neck of the 
Patient on the day and hour of [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^]. This is the 
best Remedy to recover the Sight of the Eyes, 
and to preserve the Eyes from Pain and Diseases. 
It preserveth the Sight in old Age, as perfect as 
it was in youth.

[^p.107^] 
[}CHAP. IV.}] 
 
[}Against Driness in the Brain, and other 
Diseases in the Head.}] 
 
TAKE of the following Metals, well refined: 
 
Of Gold, +Q +s Of silver, +Q ii. Of Copper, +Q i. 
Of Tynne, +o iii. 
 
Let them be all melted together in the point 
of the new Moon; then pour them out, and of 
that Mass make a piece of Plate of what Latitude 
you will: After that these Metals have been 
melted together, they must not be put into the 
fire any more. When the Planet [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^] is in his own 
House, to wit, in [^Symbol of Pisces omitted.^], let these Characters and 
Signes be engraven in the inner-side of the Money, 
and in the back-side of the Money let those 
words be written which you see in the following 
Figure, in the superior part of the Circumference 
of the Money: then let there be made a 
Ring of pure Gold, and affixed thereunto when 
the Moon is declining, for it to be hanged by: 
it matters not in what day the Ring be made, so 
that it be done in the hour of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^]. This Money 
being thus prepared, let it be hanged about the 
Neck of the Patient in the point of the new 
[^p.108^] 
Moon. It is of wonderful operation against all 
Diseases of the Head, and Brain. 
 
[}For Diseases of the Brain.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of amulets with some text and symbols.^] 
 
[}CHAP. V.}] 
 
[}Against the Palsey, a most excellent Secret.}] 
 
FOr the Consolation of those that are afflicted 
with the Fits of the Palsey, to write a Remedy 
thereof, that not without cause, it may be 
called my Archidox, seeing it excelleth all other 
Cures: Although some Ancients have thought 
(but falsely) that this Disease is incurable. Therefore 
if any one be in any manner taken with this 
Disease, let him thus do, 
 
+R of pure Gold, +o ii. of Lead, +Q ii. 
 
Both these Metals ought to be most purely refined. 
And first, when the Sun sets, going under 
the Earth, in the same hour (which you shall calculate 
according to the time of the year) melt the 
Gold in a new Earthen melting-pot, made and 
prepared for this purpose. Which being done, 
immediately after the Sun is set, cast the Lead into 
the Gold, and forthwith pour them out together, 
for the Lead will be dissolved by the Gold 
in a moment: Keep this Mass. Afterwards when 
[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] is in the 12 degree of the signe [^Symbol of Leo omitted.^], melt again 
this matter of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] and [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^], and it will appear like 
Bell-metal; to which adde 3 drams of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^]: but let 
it not be long in melting, but pour it out, and 
keep it. Then when [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] comes into the 12 degree 
[^p.110^] 
of [^Symbol of Scorpio omitted.^], melt this matter again, and cast into it one 
dram of [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^], & presently pour it out; but cast it into 
a broad form, because it admits not of any impression 
neither of the Hammer or Scissers. Then 
keep it till [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] enters into the signe [^Symbol of Aries omitted.^], which 
commonly happens 
every yeer on the 
10 day of March: 
Then engrave the 
Characters with the 
Signes and Words 
on both sides as you 
see them drawn in 
this Figure, and begin 
to engrave them 
in the hour of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^], 
and finish them before 
the end of that 
hour. It needs not 
be observed what 
day the same be 
done, only this, that 
[^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] be in [^Symbol of Aries omitted.^], as is abovesaid. 
The Money 
being thus prepared, 
is to be kept; 
And when the Palsey taketh any one, 
let the time, day, and 
hour be diligently enquired of the beginning of 
the Disease; and the same hour of that day, let 
the Signe be hanged about his Neck. This is a 
great Mystery: but in the mean time let the 
Aurum Potabile of our description be administred 
to the Patient. 
 
[}Against the Palsey.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of amulets with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
[^p.111^] 
[}CHAP. VI.}] 
 
[}Against the Stone and Sand in the Reins.}] 
 
THe Money against the Stone, consists of 
4 Metals: to wit, of Gold, Silver, Tynne, 
and Lead: As followeth. 
 
+R of Gold, +Q iii. of Silver, +Q iii. of Tynne, +Q i. 
of Lead, +Q i. ss. 
 
Let all these Metals be melted together in a 
new Melting-pot for Gold, on Saturday at 10 of 
the Clock before noon, [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] increasing; which being 
melted, cast in Saltpeter mixed with Tartar, 
for this cause only, to make them the more 
tractable, and easie to be molten and wrought 
upon. Afterwards, let them be poured out and 
cast into the form of a Lamen, and let it be cut, 
and polished, and filed in the hour of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] and day 
of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^]; but as yet, let nothing be engraven thereon. 
Also, the Ring is not to be forged, that it 
come not into the fire any more after the melting, 
but is to be formed with a File: wherefore 
the Lamen is to be poured out, and cast the larger 
and broader, that the Ring and Lamen may be 
both one piece. And if it can be, let the Lamen 
be so poured out after the melting, that by 
the mixture of divers Metals, especially of the 
Lead and Tynne, the brittle matter may evade; 
[^p.112^] 
and the substance remain hard, that it may not 
be wrought with the Hammer, nor cut with Scissers. 
This being done, then look for the Moon; 
and in the point of the New Moon, then begin 
the Sculpture: and make haste, that one side of 
the Lamen may be finished in that hour, which is 
marked with the Letter A. Afterwards, let this 
Money be safely kept until some day of [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^], when 
[^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] is in Aspect with some good Planet, as [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^], [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], or 
[^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^]; then let the Words and Characters be engraven 
on the other-side, marked with B, in the hour 
of [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^], as you see them in the following Figure. 
Then let the Lamen be hanged about the Neck 
of the Patient that hath the Stone, when the 
Moon is decreased, on the day and hour of [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. The 
Ring ought to be made of Iron, to which the Lamen 
is hanged. Let the Patient also drink Wine 
every morning, wherein the said Seal hath been 
steeped all night, and afterwards hang it about 
his Neck again. This doth wonderfully expel 
the Stone, and Sand or Gravel out of the Reins; 
for which thing also Spirit of Roman Vitriol is 
good to drink.

[^Omitted two images of amulets with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
[^p.113^] 
[}CHAP. VII.}] 
 
[}Of the Members of Generation.}] 
 
THe loss of Strength and Virtue in the Members 
of Generation, is a certain Sympathy 
proceeding from gross Fatness, which as a certain 
Spasma impedites the power of the Members 
of that place. This happens by divers accidents; 
some whereof are natural, others are 
against nature, by Witchcraft. For the Remedy 
of the natural Passion, we use this remedy: Let 
these Words, with the Characters adjoyned, be 
written in new Parchment, which afterwards is 
to be bound about the nut of the yard. 
 
AVGALIRIOR [^GREEK OMITTED^] [^HEBREW OMITTED.^] 
 
[^Figures omitted.^] 
 
This Writing in Parchment ought to be renewed 
every day by the space of 9 dayes, before 
Sun-rising every morning, by binding it, or 
rowling it with the Writing backwards about 
the Prepure, and there let it remain night and 
day; and as often as you renew the Parchment, 
or change it, let the old-one, which you take off, 
be burnt to ashes, and let the Patient drink it in 
a draught of warm wine. This is a most excellent 
[^p.114^] 
Remedy, to be had with the least cost. But 
if any one desires to be preserved from these evils, 
let him wear about his Neck a Lamen of Silver, 
with the same Words and Signs engraven 
thereupon: Or if one make a Lamen of Gold, 
and engrave the same Words and Characters 
thereupon, it will be far better. But when it 
happens that this Disease is brought upon 
any one by Witchcraft, or some Diabolical Art, 
wrought by the malice of wicked people; let the 
Patient take a piece of Horse-shooe found in 
the high-way, of which let there be made a Trident-Fork 
on the day of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], and hour of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^], as 
you see in this Figure following. 
 
[^Omitted an image of a three-pronged fork with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
The Fork aforesaid being made, let those 
Words with their Caracters be engraven upon 
the Three teeth, as you see in the Figure. And 
upon the Handle thereof, those Words and Signs 
which you see in the Figure, on Sunday before 
Sun-rising: which being done, let the Fork be 
fastned in the ground under a running Stream of 
Water, so deep, that the handle may not be seen, 
and that it cannot be found: by this means, thou 
[^p.115^] 
shalt be delivered in 9 dayes; and the person 
that hath wrought this mischief upon thee, shall 
get somthing himself in that place, from which he 
shall not so easily be delivered: So we ought to 
resist Diabolicall Arts by Nature, as Christ by 
the holy Scripture proposed to the Devil in the 
Wilderness. 
 
[}CHAP. VIII.}] 
 
[}That a Horse shall live Sound a long time.}] 
 
SOme will think that I write Witchcraft, or 
some such like things; which are far absent 
from me. For this I certainly affirm, That I write 
nothing here, which is supernatural, and which 
is not wrought and effected by the power of nature 
and Celestial influences; and whereof, for 
the most part, we are not altogether ignorant. 
As this: Let a Sadler make a Bridle for a Horse 
of a Lyons Skin, and upon the Reyns thereof let 
these Words and Characters following be written 
in their certain time. And you shall perceive 
this Horse to live not like a Horse, but like 
a Man; and longer, and his strength not to be 
abated: So that you do not use him extraordinarily, 
contrary to his wonted custome. Also, according 
as you apply those Bridly-reins to him, 
he will live thirty or forty yeers, more or less, 
contrary to the common term of a Horses life. 
The Bridle is thus to be prepared, that it serve 
[^p.116^] 
him for a Halter, without a Bit. The Leather-Dresser 
ought to prepare this Skin in the hour 
of [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^], that is, then to put it into his Pit, which 
being so prepared, let the Sadler cut the Thongs 
of it in the hour of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^], and afterwards make it 
into a Bridle when you will. To this Bridle is 
to be affixed the Lamens following in the hour 
of [^Symbol of Mercury omitted.^] upon the Thong of the Head, made of 
Tynne. 
 
[^Figures omitted.^] 
 
Upon the Thong, 
going down from 
the Fore-head to 
the Nose, let there 
be affixed these which follow, made of Copper 
in the hour of [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. 
 
[^Figures omitted.^] 
 
The following Lamens ought to be made 
of Silver, in the hour of [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^]; And affixed to the 
Bridle in the hour of [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^]. 
 
[^Figures omitted.^] 
 
These which are 
last, ought to be 
made of Gold, 
and affixed to 
the Bridle in the 
hour of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^]. 3.9. 
And apply this Bridle to the Horse in the 
hour of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], then you shall see with what power 
[^p.117^] 
Nature worketh in Words and Characters, 
where time is duly observed. 
 
[}CHAP. IX.}] 
 
[}An admirable Oyntment for Wounds.}] 
 
SImpathy, or Compassion, hath a very great 
power to operate in humane things: As if 
you take Moss that groweth upon a Scull, or 
Bone of a dead body that hath lain in the Air, 
to wit, 
 
Take of that Moss, +o ii. of Man's Grease, +o ii. 
of Mummay, and Man's Blood, each +o ss. 
Linseed Oyl, +Q ii. Oyl of Roses, and 
Bole-Armoniack, each +Q i. 
 
Let them be all beat together in a Morter so 
long, until they come to a most pure and subtil 
Oyntment; then keep it in a Box. And when any 
wound happens, dip a stick of wood in the 
blood, that it may be bloody; which being dryed, 
thrust it quite into the aforesaid Oyntment, and 
leave it therein; afterwards binde up the wound 
with a new Linen Rowler, every morning washing 
it with the Patients own Urine; and it shall 
be healed, be it never so great, without any Plaister, 
or Pain. After this manner, you may Cure 
any one that is wounded, though he be ten miles 
distant from you, if you have but his blood. 
[^p.118^] 
It helpeth also other griefs, as the pain in the 
Teeth and other hurts, if you have a stick wet in 
the Blood, and thrust into the Oyntment, and 
there left. Also, if a Horses foot be pricked 
with a nail by a Farrier or Smith, touch a stick 
with the blood, and thrust it into the Box of 
Oyntment, and leave it there, it will Cure him. 
These are the wonderful Gifts of God, given for 
the use and health of man. 
 
[}CHAP. X.}] 
 
[}The Weapons-Oyntment.}] 
 
THere may also an Oyntment be made, wherewith 
if the Weapons be anointed (wherewith 
a wound is inflicted) the said wounds shall 
be cured without pain. This is made as the other, 
except only +o i. of Honey, and +Q i. of Ox-fat is 
to be added to this. But because the Weapons 
cannot alwayes be had, the Wood aforesaid is 
better. 
 
[^p.119^] 
[}CHAP. XI.}] 
 
[}Against the Gout.}] 
 
TAke of Mummy, Mastick, Red Myrrhe, 
Olibanum, Ammoniacum, Oppopanax, 
Bdelium, each +o ii. Vitriol, lb ii. 
Honey, lb ii. Tartar, +o i. ss. Aquavitæ, 
gal. iii. 
 
Let them be all Distilled together into an Oyl. 
Then take little Flyes, such as are bred in the 
dead Carcasses of Horses, and make an Oyl of 
them, being well bruised. With which Oyl of 
the Horse-flies, mix +o ii. with +o iv. of the other 
Oyl: These two Oyls being well mixed together, 
let them be Distilled again, and let this 
Distilled Oyl be preserved. 
 
Then prepare the Characters, in manner following. 
 
+R of pure Gold, pure Silver, filings of Iron, 
each +Q i. of Lead, +Q ii. 
 
Let them be all melted together in the hour of 
the New Moon, by a very strong fire, that the 
filings of the Iron may be melted. For they will 
hardly melt, wherefore some Boras is to be added 
to them. Then let all the melted matter be 
[^p.120^] 
poured out together upon a broad smooth stone, 
that it may make a thin Lamen: for it cannot be 
wrought with the Hammer afterwards, because 
of the Iron: afterwards, when [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] is in Conjunction 
with [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^], in the same hour let the Characters, 
Words, and Signes of the Lamen be engraven 
thereupon, like two stamps of a piece of Money; 
and let them be finished in that hour. 
 
[}For the Gout.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of amulets with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
Let both the said pieces of Money be engraven 
only on one side, in the hour of the said conjunction 
of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] and [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^]; and let them so kept, that 
they touch not one another. 
 
Afterwards let there be made a Sigil of pure 
Gold, not so thick as the other Lamen: when [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] is 
in Conjunction with [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^] or [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^], let the Characters, 
Signes, and Words be engraven thereon. But 
note, that the Seals are to be conjoyned together 
when there is a Conjunction of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] and 
[^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^]: The second face of the Golden Seal, marked 
[^p.121^] 
with the number 2, is to be turned against the 
engraven face of the superior Seal which hath 
not the Image of a man, and is marked with the 
number 4. But if [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] be in Conjunction with [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^], 
then the second face of the Seal marked with the 
number 2, is to be turned upon the face of the 
upper Seal, which hath engraven upon it the 
image of a man, and is marked with the number 
5. And when [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] comes to the 6 degree of [^Symbol of Cancer omitted.^] in 
the same order as is before shown, let the pieces 
of Money be both joyned together, the Gold 
being placed in the middle. Let them be all 
bored with one hole through the middle, and 
fastened together with an Iron-wyer, and let the 
Patient hang them about his neck. And let his 
Members be anointed with the Oyl before 
prescribed: hereby you shall try the powerful operations 
of Nature, even in such as are over 60 yeers 
old. 
 
[}The Picture of Golden Money for 
the Gout.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of coins with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
[^p.122^] 
[}A Sympathetical Oyntment against 
the Gout.}] 
 
Let the Blood of the Patient afflicted with 
the Gout, be reserved: And that you may know 
how to use it, Distil a Water from it in Balneo 
Maria. 
 
Take hereof, +o vii. to which adde, of Oyl of 
Roses, Venice Sope, each +o +s of Man's 
Grease, Bears Grease, juyce of Sengreen, 
each +o i. Marrow of an Ox, +o ss. 
 
Let them be all gently boyled in a vessel of 
Brass, till they come to the thickness of an Oyntment; 
continually stirring it, lest it burn: Afterwards 
upon the eight day of the Moon's encreasing, 
let the Soles of the Feet of the Patient 
be pricked with an instrument, as it uses to be 
done in Applications for the Winde: and the 
place grieved being in this manner opened, let 
them be anointed with this Oyntment very hot, 
that it may penetrate. And by so doing 9 weeks, 
he shall be Cured cleer of the Gout. 
 
This Oyntment will last 10 yeers in its full 
force and virtue, being kept in a cold place. 
 
[^p.123^] 
[}CHAP. XII.}] 
 
[}Against Contractures.}] 
 
OYl of Sulphur against Contractures and 
shrinking of Sinews, is not to be contemned, 
but rather to be esteemed as a principal 
Remedy against such infirmities. This Oyl is 
made as followeth: Take of the best Sulphur, 
lb. xv. Sublime it in a Cucurbite of Earth 
through a Glass Limbeck. Put the sublimed matter 
in a cool Cellar to dissolve, and in success of 
time, it will be resolved into an Oyl. Then make 
the following Composition. 
 
+R of Oyl of Sulphur, +o ii. Black Soap, +o iii. 
Aquavita, +o v. Oyl Olive, Oyl of Roses, 
each, +o i. 
 
Let all these be boyled, as the other, unto an 
Oyntment for the Gout; alwayes having a care 
that the flame take it not: Let the Members be 
very well anointed with this Unguent for 
30 dayes; causing the Patient to sweat in a dry 
Bath. It excellently helps contracted Members. 
 
[}A Seal for Contractures.}] 
 
Take what quantity you please of Gold thrice 
purified by Antimony: or if you will, the weight 
[^p.124^] 
of a Ducat. Adde to it a little Boras, and melt 
it when [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] is in the 19 or 20 degree of [^Symbol of Capricorn omitted.^]; and 
cast into it, as soon as it is molten, 30 grains of 
the filings of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] under the same hour. Which being 
melted and mixt together, pour them out together, 
and let them so remain until [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] is in the 
same degree of [^Symbol of Scorpio omitted.^]: Then melt it again, and cast 
in 30 grains of the filings of Iron, and pour it 
out again as the first. Then keep it till [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] is in [^Symbol of Leo omitted.^]: 
and then form and fashion it fit for the Sculpture; 
which ought to be done in the hour of [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^]. You 
need not any further calculate according to the 
Course of [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^], till the Seal comes to be applied, 
having only respect to the hour beforehand, let 
the Signes which you see here drawn in the Figure, 
be engraven on both sides of the Money: 
This Money muse be sewed up in a fine Cloth; 
and is to be hanged about the Neck by the Cloth 
only, and not by its own body, in the day and 
hour of [^Symbol of Jupiter omitted.^], [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] encreasing. 
 
[}For Contractures.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of coins with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
[^p.125^] 
[}CHAP. XIII.}] 
 
[}For Womens Terms.}] 
 
AN inordinate Flux of this Disease, doth extremely 
grieve many Women, sometimes 
divers years: by so much the more healthy 
and strong such women are, by how much 
they have their Courses in their ordinary seasons, 
and are then delivered from them. From 
whence arises a twofold way of reducing them 
into due order. The first is, to stay the Flux, and 
reduce it into a due course: the latter is to be 
used in the defects thereof, to provoke them to 
an ordinary Flux: the defect of them bringeth 
death; wherefore to provoke them, let there be 
formed of pure Copper, without mixture of any 
other metal, a Seal in the hour of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], as is in the 
following Figure: But if the same cannot be 
perfectly finished in that hour, let it then remain 
unperfect until the same hour of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^] comes 
again, and then perfect it: The form whereof 
must be this. 
 
[^p.126^] 
[}For the Menstruæ.}] 
 
[^Omitted an image of an amulet with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
This Sigil ought to be formed with a File into 
one piece, and is to be bound with a string upon 
the Back of the woman through two Rings, 
applying it at the beginning of the Back-bone 
upon the Testes, laying the Sculpture upon the 
flesh, and that in the hour of [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^]. 
 
But if Nature suffer through too much abundant 
Fluxes, let the Characters be engraven in 
pure Silver in the hour of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^], on both sides of 
the Money, as they are drawn in the following 
Figure. Then let them be wrapped and sewed 
up in silk, (for it must not be applied to the naked 
flesh) and let it be bound upon the Navel 
of the Woman, turning that face next her body 
which is marked with the number 10. And afterwards 
when the Flux begins to stay, let her 
[^p.127^] 
wear it 30 dayes, and then take it off: for if she 
wear it any longer, there is danger lest they be 
quite driven away and stopped; and so cause a 
greater hurt than the first. 
 
[}For the Menstruæ.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of coins with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
[}CHAP. XIV.}] 
 
[}For the Leprosie.}] 
 
THis Disease comes to the Lepers from their 
Nativity, and not only by accidents. Wherefore 
we have many other Remedies for them, 
conducing much unto the Cure thereof. It is 
certain that Aurun Potabile drunk, doth palliate 
and hide the Leprosie, but not quite take it out 
of the blood. The cause whereof is, because every 
clean and sound man hath Balsom, but the 
[^p.128^] 
Leprous persons have none in them; by reason 
whereof also it comes to pass, that they have no 
health in them: also, a congealed Member wanteth 
Balsom; and therefore it is insensible when 
the strength of the Gold comes into the Stomack, 
which afterwards distributeth it into the 
several Members of the Body; from thence resulteth 
a certain humidity 
which ingendereth 
the Balsom; wherefore 
the Leprosie ceaseth to 
increase, so long as there 
is any virtue or strength 
of the Gold in the Stomach. 
Also, a Physitian 
cannot know or discern 
the Disease of Leprosie, 
if the Leprous person 
hath drunk Gold 
three dayes before his 
visitation. We intend 
not to speak in this 
place of such as are manifestly 
infected, but only 
of such whose Disease 
is doubtful. 
 
[}For the Leprosie.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of coins with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
If any do use the Sigil 
above written, and 
such like Remedies, let 
them not doubt of help. Let this kinde of Sigil 
be made of pure Gold, and wrought into a Lamen 
in the hour of [^Symbol of Saturn omitted.^], but the Characters ought 
to be ingraven in the hour of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^], when [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] is in [^Symbol of Leo omitted.^], 
[^p.129^] 
and [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] in the same sign; which usually happens 
in July. Let it be hanged about the Leper in 
the hour of [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], the Moon increasing: Let the Patient 
also drink Wine, wherein the same Sigil 
hath been some time steeped. 
 
It ought to be renewed every year in July, for 
this Sigil loseth its force in a year. 
 
The Leprosie working so strongly in the body 
of man, wherein it fixeth root. 
 
[}CHAP. XV.}] 
 
[}For the Vertigo.}] 
 
MAny who do labour with this disease, the 
Heaven and Earth seems to them to turn 
like a wheel, and all things to run round. To 
others there seems a kinde of a Circle to flie before 
their eyes. This is a kinde of the Falling-Evil 
or Palsie more or less. For there is such a 
Convulsion of the Brain, that the Spirits of the 
Sight and the Brain, are impedited by a certain 
gross thick vapour ascending from the Stomach 
to the head, through the optick Nerves. Against 
this Disease make the Sigil which follows. 
 
In the hour of Mars, and day of Jupiter, the 
Moon in Aries, which is the best Aspect of Mars; 
but see that she hath no evil Aspect from any other 
Planet. 
 
[^p.130^] 
Take of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] +Q +s of [^Symbol of Mars omitted.^] +Q ii. of [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] +q v. 
 
Let these 3 Metals be purely refined and melted 
together into one. Let them be poured out 
and wrought into a very thin Lamen, and formed 
with a little Ear; afterwards when the Moon is 
in the 12 degree of Taurus, engrave the Signes 
which follow, and apply it to the Patient in the 
hour of the New Moon, on the very point that 
it first beginneth. 
 
Use this Remedy with the Seal: 
 
+R of Organum, grains 4. Of Unicorns-horn, 
grains 2. Musk, grain 1. Spirit of 
Vitriol, grains 6. 
 
Let them be administred every morning in a 
spoon, about 3 a Clock after mid-night, continuing 
it 13 dayes; and after every time taking it, 
rest one hour. 
 
[}For the Vertigo.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of coins with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
[^p.131^] 
[}CHAP. XVI.}] 
 
[}For the Cramp.}] 
 
MAke a mixture of Sol, Luna, Venus, and 
Mars; and let it be wrought into a Lamen, 
and thereof make a Sigil when the Sun is 
under the Earth, in the hour of Saturne. And 
then in the hour of Jupiter engrave these Characters 
and Signes with the words in the hour of 
the Sun; and apply it in the hour of the Sun 
when he is under the earth. 
 
You may also make a Ring of the said Metals, 
on which engrave the same Signes, and wear the 
Ring on the finger of the Heart; but this ought 
to be done in the time, day, and hour before prescribed. 
 
[}CHAP. XVII.}] 
 
[}For the trembling of the Heart.}] 
 
THe Hearts of men do somtimes suffer trembling, 
especially of Nobles and great 
men; for seldom doth this Disease take poor 
and mean men or women. From whence may 
be seen how God Almighty hath so artificially 
[^p.132^] 
distributed passions to every state and Condition 
for their correction and admonition, without 
respect of persons. It is not to be numbered 
amongst easie Diseases: for where it begins to 
rule, it casts the Patient upon the earth, and bereaveth 
him of strength and sense, and somtimes 
of life. It riseth from the Membranes and receptacles 
wherein the Heart is involved, it being 
compressed with corrupt and ill Flegm. Against 
this, make a Sigil as follows, observing the 
due times. 
 
First, in the day and hour of [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^], take of [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] +o ss. 
which put and keep in a melting-pot until the 
hour of the Sun, which is the 4 hour following 
in the order of unequal hours; then melt it with 
the fire, and the [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] being melted, cast in two 
ounces of [^Symbol of Sun omitted.^] purely refined, as the [^Symbol of Moon omitted.^] ought to be: 
these two Metals being well melted and mixt 
together, leave them to cool in the Melting-pot 
by themselves, and keep them till the hour of 
Venus next following: then melt them again, and 
cast in two drams of pure [^Symbol of Venus omitted.^], and pour it out; then 
work it into a Lamen with a Hammer, & prepare 
it ready for the engraving of the Signes: then 
mark when the Moon and Venus behold one another 
with a good Aspect; then engrave upon the 
Money these two Signes which you see here. 
 
[^Figures omitted.^] 
 
[^p.133^] 
Afterwards in the point of the New Moon engrave 
these three Characters following under the 
other two. 
 
[^Figures omitted.^] 
 
Let it rest from that New Moon untill the next 
Full Moon, and in the point of that Full Moon 
in the same face of the Money over all the Signes 
let these following words be written. 
 
[}For the trembling of the Heart.}] 
 
[^Omitted two images of coins with some writing and symbols.^] 
 
This being done, mark when the Sun enters 
Leo; and in the same hour of his ingression, inscribe 
the Characters and Words you see in the 
other figure, on the other-side of the Money; 
and let them all be begun and ended the same 
hour. 
 
This Sigil being thus prepared and finished, is 
to be hanged about the Patients Neck in the 
[^p.134^] 
hour and point of the Full Moon, that it may 
touch his naked flesh upon his Heart. 
 
Against this trembling of the Heart, there is also 
a most excellent secret; our Aurum Potabile, 
and Quintessence of Pearl, of our description, 
also oyl of Coral prepared as followeth. 
 
[}The manner of Preparing Oyl of Coral 
against the trembling of the 
Heart.}] 
 
+R of Coral, lb i. Of Common Salt, 
manip. 3. 
 
Let them be wrought into a most fine powder, 
and put it into a Glass strongly Luted according 
to the sequent description: Take common Clay, 
or Potters white Clay, ashes made of the bones 
of the heads of four-footed Beasts, filings of 
Iron, Glass in powder, common Salt, Ceruse, 
&c. which being wet, mingle them together, &c. 
put the luted Glass with the matter into Ashes 
contained in an Iron Kettle, according to art; 
kindle first a gentle fire, and increase it by degrees 
until the Spirit and Fumes do pass into a 
Vessel below; then increase the fire more vehemently, 
until there remaineth no more moisture. 
This Oyl is a most excellent Remedy for the 
trembling of the Heart, taken alone by it self, 
without any thing else added to it. 
 
[^p.135^] 
[}An Appendix concerning Ruptures of 
the Bones.}] 
 
In what manner soever Bones are broken, they 
are excellently well knit and consolidated, with 
the following Unguent, and are all orderly 
joyned. 
 
+R of Honey +o ii. Of Antimony, and Oyl of 
Vitriol +Q ii. Of Badgers Grease, Deers Sewet, 
Bears Grease, and Sope, each +o i. Turpentine +o i. ss. 
VVax +o ii. 
 
Let them be boyled into an Oyntment, and 
therewith let the Ruptures be anointed with a 
hot hand against the fire; it wonderfully Cures, 
Heals, and Consolidates, above all other. 
 
[}The end of the first Treatise.}]
