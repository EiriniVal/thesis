[}THE 
Expert Lapidary: 
OR 
A Physicall Treatise of the 
secret Vertues of Stones.}] 
 
[}1. Jacinth.}] 
 
OF these there are two kindes, red, which 
is the best; the other like a Carbuncle, 
which is presently changed by 
the fire, and of a small bigness. 
 
This Stone being carried about a man, preserveth 
a man from hurt by lightning, and preserveth 
him from the plague; if it be brought near 
to any that hath the plague, it loseth its lustre, 
splendor, and brightness; so it doth being 
brought near to any poison; being beaten into 
powder, and so taken inwardly, or born whole 
about a man, it provoketh sleep, and encreaseth 
honour and wisedom. 
 
Authors for this, Cardanus and Wicker. 
 
[^p.264^] 
[}2. Saphire.}] 
 
THis being born about one, helps all diseases 
of the skin, as Morphew, Itch, Scabs, 
Ring-worms, & c. keeps back sweating, makes 
men chaste, causeth strength, and a good colour, 
takes away vain fears, helps Necromancy, and 
troubles by Necromantick Apparitions, by divine 
gift; it makes the minde quiet, godly, and safe; 
being drunk inwardly, it helps such as are bit by 
venomous Beasts and Scorpions, inward Ulcers, 
Poyson and Pestilence, flesh growing in the Eyes, 
strengthneth and maketh glad the heart, being 
mixed with other Medicines for the same purpose; 
it asswageth Carbuncles by being touched 
with it; being worn, it defends from the Pestilence; 
inwardly taken, it helps Ulcers in the 
inner parts, and burstness. 
 
Authors for this, 
 
Albertus magnus, Garcias, Cardanus, Dioscorides, 
and Gallen. 
 
[}3. Emerald.}] 
 
OF Emeralds there are three sorts, the best 
comes from Scilicia, and is the softest; 
the next from Peru, which is harder, and not so 
deep a colour, but more perspicuous and glistering; 
the third (which is the worst) comes from 
the West Indies, and is of a dull colour, scarce to 
be seen through; scarce any that come from Peru 
are without spots. 
 
[^p.265^] 
They rejoyce most in their own light, and are 
of more force by night, then by day; no Stone 
more safe to carry about one, then this, the Saphire, 
and Jacinth. 
 
This Stone stayeth lust, and according to Cardanus, 
and Albertus magnus, they will break, if 
they be about a man when he deflours a Virgin. 
 
Being born about one, it stayes the Vertigo, 
or dizziness in the head, strengthens the memory, 
stayes inordinate passions and affections, 
helps the sight, causeth love of Study, encreaseth 
riches; being held under the tongue, it is 
good to divine with, it causeth eloquence. 
 
Being taken inwardly, it cureth the Falling-sickness, 
bloody Flux; it resisteth Poison, and 
helps vain fears, as of Fairies, Night-Hags, Devils, 
& c. it helps folly and anger, and brings a 
good condition. 
 
Cardanus, Albertus Magnus, Garcias, and 
Aristotle. 
 
[}4. Ruby.}] 
 
RUby is a red Stone shining like fire, it restraineth 
lust being born about one; but 
most of all, being taken inwardly, it resisteth the 
Pestilence, preserveth the body sound, strengthens 
the vital spirits, thereby taking away evil 
thoughts, and making the man nimble-witted, 
chearful, and therefore fortunate. 
 
Cardanus, and Wicker. 
 
[^p.266^] 
[}5. Granate}] 
 
OF this Stone there are two sorts, East and 
West, and the West are supposed to be 
best, the_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] are of the quality of the Earth and 
Fire; being worn outwardly; or taken inwardly, 
they resist sadness, but take away sleep; they 
streng_[^ORIG. BLURRED^]hen the heart but hurt the brain as much; 
they stir the blood and make men angry. The 
Easternly work the same effects, but not so violently. 
 
Cardanus, and Wicker. 
 
[}6. Sardine.}] 
 
OF Sardine there are three sorts in the Indies, 
to wit, red, fat, and that with silver 
creases, but the best of all come from Babylon; 
being born about one, they keep away evil 
dreams, quicken the wit, bridle in the blood and 
choller, and make men conquerours in strifes and 
suits of Law, and encrease riches. 
 
Cardanus, Pliny. 
 
[}7. Diamond.}] 
 
A Diamond is the hardest of all Stones, and 
most effectual in whatsoever vertue it 
hath; it wonderfully prevails against night-fears, 
therefore must of necessity prevail against 
melancholly and choller adust; or it may do it 
by strengthning the heart, for fear comes 
[^p.267^] 
through weakness of the vital spirits, and is 
known by the beating or motion of the heart. 
It is reported to make those infortunate that 
wear them: for it is so to the Heart, as the Sun 
is to the Eye, though it be light it self, yet it dazles 
the eyes, and makes them blinde, if you 
look upon him; the best way then to wear them, 
is at a distance from the body; they make men 
undaunted, therefore they are best for Cowards 
to wear: they are ill to wear for dishonest people, 
for they make them bold to do mischief. 
 
Cardanus, and Garcias. 
 
[}8. Amethist.}] 
 
OF these there are two sorts, the one white 
like Christal, and hardly known from it; 
the other of a Violet colour: the best are 
brought out of India, they make men staid, and 
watchful; being bound to ones Navel, they keep 
him from drunkenness, they are profitable in 
fights and huntings; they quicken the wit, take 
away sleep, and vapors that flow into the head; 
being laid in Wine all night, and the Wine drunk 
in the morning, they make women fruitful, and 
resist poison. Cardanus. 
 
[}9. Bezoar.}] 
 
THere are two sorts, East and West Bezoar; 
the East is best, it hath no obnoxious quality 
with it, if you take never so much of it; being 
taken inwardly, it is profitable against the bitings 
[^p.268^] 
of venomous beasts, and all melancholly 
diseases, as Leprosie, Itch, Scabs, Quartane Agues, 
Ring-worms, &c. It hath been known to cure 
men past hope, and left off by Physicians, and 
hath restored them to their former health; it resisteth 
poison; a little of it in powder being 
put upon a Wound made by a venomous Beast, 
sucks out the poison: or being made into Lozenges 
with Rose-water, it is a Preservative against 
all manner of poison. 
 
Garcias. 
 
[}10. Topaze:}] 
 
TOpaze is a Stone of a green colour, being 
rubbed upon a Physical Whetstone, to wit, 
a Whetstone of Cypress, it produceth an Oyl 
which will cure diseases in the Eyes; also it is 
helpful for Dropsies and Consumptions. If you 
put it into a vessel of boiling water, it cools the 
water so, that you may presently thrust in your 
hand, and take it out, without any hurt to your 
hand. 
 
Epiphanius, Albertus magnus. 
 
[}11. Snakes Stone.}] 
 
CAtch a Water-snake, and draw a string 
through his tail, and hang him up with 
his head downwards, a vessel of water being under, 
into which he may gape, and after certain 
hours or dayes he will vomit a Stone, which falling 
into the water, will drink it all up: this 
[^p.269^] 
Stone being bound to the Belly of one that 
hath the Dropsie, draweth out, and drinketh up 
al the water. 
 
Hollerius. 
 
[}12. Toad Stone.}] 
 
A Todes Stone by gentle touching, or stroaking, 
takes away the pain, inflamation, and 
swelling from any Wound, made by any venomous 
Creature, and instantly draws out the poison; 
therefore if a Rat, Bee, Wasp, Spider, 
Hornet, or any other venomous Creature, have 
hurt any part about thee, touch the place gently 
with this Stone, and the pain and swelling will 
cease. 
 
Take a Toad, and tied her up in a purse full of 
holes, and lay it in an Emmet-hill, and when the 
flesh is all eaten away, you may finde the Stone, 
if there be any; for all Toads have it not. 
 
If you accidentally get such a one, and desire 
to know whether it be right or no, hold it near 
to a live Toad, and if it be good and true, she 
will proffer to take it away. 
 
Wicker, Lemnius. 
 
[}13. Alectorius.}] 
 
THis is a Stone found in the ventricle of an old 
Cock; it is of the bigness of a Bean, it maketh 
him that beareth it, beloved, constant, 
and bold; maketh them beloved of Women, 
[^p.270^] 
and strong in the sports of Venus, being held 
under the tongue it quencheth thirst. 
 
Lemnius, Albertus Magnus. 
 
[}14. Jasper.}] 
 
IAsper being borne about one, stops Bleeding, 
helps Travel in Women, stayes Lust, cures 
Agues and Dropsies, and chears the heart. 
 
Garcias, Albert. Mag. Mathiolus. 
 
[}15. Nephriticus.}] 
 
THis is a stone which being borne about one, 
stayes the pains in the Reins, and Stomach, 
expelleth Stone, and Gravel. 
 
A certain man being troubled with the Stone, 
wearing this Stone about him, voided so much 
Gravel, that he feared the quantity would do 
him harme being cast out, it was so exceeding 
great; therefore he laid off the Stone, and presently 
he voided no more Gravel; but being 
pained again, he wore the Stone, and presently 
the pain ceased, and abundance of Gravel; and 
small Stones came from him; for it is of that 
admirable faculty, being borne about one, next 
the skin, that it preserves from the pain of the 
Stone, and cools the Reins. 
 
Another of ten years of age was pained with 
the Stone, and wearing a Bracelet of these 
Stones, never was troubled with it afterwards. 
 
Nich. Monardis, Wicker. 
 
[^p.271^] 
[}16. Tiburones.}] 
 
IN the Indian sea are caught fish, called Tiburones, 
being great, strong, fighting fish, and of 
a terrible aspect, which daily fights with the Sea 
Wolves; in their heads is found three or four 
Stones, and sometimes more, very white, great 
and heavy; so that sometimes one of them 
weighs two pound: the powde_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] of them cureth 
the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, and difficulty 
of Urine; and is of no taste at all. 
 
Nich Monardis. 
 
[}17. Blood-stone.}] 
 
THis is a kind of Jasper, being worn next the 
skin, it stops bleeding either at the nose 
or mouth, or by wound; it stops the Hemorrhoydes 
or Piles, and stayes the Courses in Women: 
this it doth (as experience teacheth) either 
by dipping the Stone in cold water, and 
holding it it in the hand, or by binding it to the 
place, so it touch the skin. 
 
N. Monardis. 
 
[}18. Hæmatites.}] 
 
LApis Hæmatites is binding and a little heating, 
and extenuating; it cures Scars and 
[^p.272^] 
Scurf in the eyes, being mingled with Honey; 
and eyes that be Blood-shed, being mingled with 
Womans milk: it is given in Wine against difficulty 
of Urine, and overflowing of the Courses 
in Women; and in Juyce of Pomegranates, to 
such as Vomit blood. 
 
Wicker. 
 
[}19. Sea Sand.}] 
 
IF a man that hath the Dropsie, stand up to 
the neck in Sea-sand, by the Sea-side, in a 
hot day, it will drink up all the water and cure 
the Disease. 
 
Wicker. 
 
[}20. Whetstone of Cypress.}] 
 
A Whetstone of Cypress, that which comes 
off from it by whetting, stayes the falling 
off of Hair, and causeth it to grow in bald places, 
it keeps the breasts of Virgins from growing; 
being drunk with Vinegar, it consumes the 
Milt, and cures the Falling sickness. 
 
Wicker. 
 
[}21. Ætites,}] 
 
THere are four sorts of these, but the best 
comes from Affrick, and are found in an 
Eagles nest, which is very little and soft having 
another little one within it; and is thought to 
be the female. The Male come from Arabia, 
[^p.273^] 
and is hard like a Gaul, having another hard 
Stone within it, and is of a reddish colour, 
 
The third somes from Cypress, and is like that 
which comes from Affrick, but is bigger, and 
hath sand and little stones within it. 
 
The fourth is called Taphiusius, from the place 
whence it comes, and is found in Rivers; it is 
white and round in form: this is the worst of all. 
 
These all joyntly are called Lapis pregnans, or 
a Stone with Childe, because it carries another 
Stone within it. 
 
If this Stone be given to a thief in bread, he 
cannot swallow it down, or if you boil it in any 
thing, and give the Decoction to any that hath 
stollen any thing from you, he cannor drink 
it though the Stone be out. 
 
Being bound to the Neck or Arm of a Woman, 
it strengthens conception, and stayes miscarriage; 
in the time of her Labour, if it be 
bound to the inner part of her Thigh, near the 
place of conception, it causeth her to have an 
easie labour, almost without any pain: but be 
sure you take it away so soon as she is delivered, 
for fear of further mischief. 
 
Pliny, Disocorides, Lemnius. 
 
[}22. Chelidonius.}] 
 
IF you take young Swallows out of their nest 
before the full Moon, you shall finde two 
little Stones in their Ventricles: the one reddish, 
the other black: these ought never to 
touch the earth, but be kept close wrapped up 
in Bullocks or Stags leather; the former being 
[^p.274^] 
bound under the Armeholes, helps the Falling-sickness, 
the other Feavers. 
 
Thus Albertus Magnus. 
 
Some say if you prick out their eyes, the Old 
one will bring a Stone which will recover their 
sight; and some say she doth it by Celandine; 
the Stone will remain in their Ventricle: I have 
tried this, I pricked out the eyes of some in a 
nest, and not of others; and I found the Reddish-stone 
in the Ventricle of one, whose eyes I 
pricked out, and she could see again; but in 
those whose eyes were not pricked out, there 
was none; but I never observed the Lunation. 
 
Also they say if you break their Legs, she will 
bring a Stone which will instantly cure them; 
which Stone will be found in the nest. 
 
[}23. Lincyrius.}] 
 
LApis Lincyrius, being cast among burning 
coles quencheth them; and if you wrap it 
up in a Linnen cloth, not onely that, but the 
cloth also, will remain unburned even in the 
midst of the hottest fire. 
 
It wonderfully helps forward the Travail of 
Women. 
 
Epiphanius. 
 
[}24. Jet. 25. Amber.}] 
 
IEt being beaten into a very fine powder, and 
given to a Woman fasting, in White Wine, 
will presently make manifest whether she be a 
Virgin or no; for if she presently make Water, 
[^p.275^] 
her Virginity is lost; if not, the contrary. 
 
The same effect also hath Amber; both of 
them, or either of them being hung about ones 
Neck, are profitable against distillation of 
Phlegm into the Throat and Lungs. 
 
Baptista Porta. Mathiolus 
 
[}26. Lapis Lazuli.}] 
 
IT is a Stone of a Sky colour; the best of them 
have spots in them like stars of gold, and are 
found in Gold Mines: being given inwardly, 
they purge Melancholly notably. So they do 
meanly: being carried about one, they make the 
bearer of them merry, fortunate, and rich. 
 
Dioscorides, Cardanus, Med. Florentini. 
 
[}27. Blatta Bizantia.}] 
 
BEing beaten into powder, and snuffed up into 
the Nose, helps the fits of the Mother, 
and such as have the Falling sickness; being 
taken inwardly, it looseneth the Belly. 
 
Dioscorides, Medici Coloniensis. 
 
[}28. Pearls.}] 
 
PEarls help trembling in Old men, Convulsions 
and Frenzies, preserve the body sound, 
and restore lost health; both amend and increase 
milk in Nurses, correct the seed and failings 
in the parts of generation, helps eating Ulcers, 
Cankers, and the Hemorrhoydes. 
 
Dardanus Wicker. 
 
[^p.276^] 
[}29. Corral.}] 
 
OF Corral there are three sorts, Black, White, 
Red; the first is most rare, the second most 
common, the third most excellent. 
 
Let a Childe newly born take ten grains of 
Red Corral in powder, in a little Breast Milk, before 
it taste any other food, and it wll never 
have the Falling-sickness. 
 
Generally it takes away all inward griefs, 
restores weak and sick bodies, by strengthning 
the heart, resisteth all Diseases, growing in 
children, by strengthening nature; cureth all 
Fluxes in Men, Women, and Children; it stops 
blood flowing from any part, it stops the Tearms 
in Women if they be immoderate, else not; 
and brings their bodies to good temperature. 
 
Arnoldus, Mathiolus, Wicker. 
 
[}30. Turkey Stone.}] 
 
THis Stone being worn in a Ring, as sickness 
comes, or death draws nigh, so it loseth its 
lustre; it looks perfectly blew, in sickness pale; 
a little before death perfect white: and so it 
looks if brought neer to any Poyson. 
 
This treatise was revised, and for want of 
time, left to posterity without addition.
