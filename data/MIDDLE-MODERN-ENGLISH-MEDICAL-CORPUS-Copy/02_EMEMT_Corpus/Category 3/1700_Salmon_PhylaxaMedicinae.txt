[^A preface and a list of medicines including prices omitted.^] 
[^Extract 1, pp. 4-25^] 
 
[^p.4^] 
[}CHAP. I. 
 
Aqua Regulata, Our Eye Water.}] 
 
I. TAke Fennel Water, or 
White or Damask Rose 
Water five quarts; Salt 
of Vitriol half an Ounce. Saccharum 
Saturni, two drachms and an 
half: Dissolve, digest ten days, and 
filter through brown Paper: Then 
take rectified Spirit of Wine six or 
seven Ounces, dissolve therein fine 
Aloes, choice Opium, of each five 
drachms; Let it settle, then decant the 
clear, and filter it; in this filtred liquor 
dissolve Camphire five drachms: 
joyn these two Liquors together, and 
add thereto Regulus of Antimony, 
or Crocus Metallorum in very subtle 
Powder, five Ounces: Shake all 
well together three or four times a 
day, for ten or twelve days; then let 
it settle, and keep it quiet upon the 
faces for use. 
 
II. This is inferiour to no Eye-Water 
extant, but is one of the 
best Remedies yet known for 
Blindness, dimness of the Sight, 
Pin and Web, Pearls, and most 
other Infirmities of the Eyes; it 
eases all manner of Pains, and 
cures Diseases of the Eye to 
a miracle. 
 
III. It takes away Suffusions, 
Clouds, Pearls, Bloodshot, only 
by washing therewith three or 
four times a day: It cures sore 
Eyes, running Eyes, salt, hot and 
sharp Rheums in the Eyes, Ulcers, 
Fistulas &c. having made several 
see, who to my knowledge have 
been long blind. It is a powerful 
and magistral Water for this 
purpose, and therefore ought to 
be kept as a Jewel. 
 
IV. If there be any Sores or 
Ulcers in the Eyes, you will find 
the Water the more beneficial, if 
you dissolve a little Virgin Honey 
therein, and then use it 
as aforesaid. 
 
V. It cures all sorts of Ulcers 
in the Mouth, Throat and Nostrils, 
or in any other part of the 
Body, whether Scorbutick or Venereal; 
you may wash the Ulcers 
with Cotton or Lint dipt in the 
Water. 
 
VI. It is a most excellent thing 
for Ulcers and Sores in the privy 
parts of Man or Woman, it eases 
the Pain, cleanses the part, 
astringes, and in a little time 
compleatly heals the Ulcer only 
by washing, or injecting of it 
with a Syringe (fit for those parts) 
three, four or five times a day. 
 
VII. It is of singular use in 
easing Pains of the GOUT, 
repelling of the Humors, and 
resolving of the tartarous matter, 
by bathing the part affected 
therewith Morning and Evening, 
and applying Stuphes wet therein 
to the same. 
 
VIII. It is of excellent use 
against all manner of Scabs, 
Pustles, breakings out, Tetters, 
Ringworms, Morphew, Scurf, 
Spots, and other deformities of 
the Skin, by washing them with 
[^p.5^] 
it six or seven times a day, for 
some days, and applying Cloaths 
wet in it, over the said Defects 
for a few Minutes. 
 
IX. Being drawn up the Nostrils, 
or cast up with a Syringe, 
it is a good Errhine to purge the 
Head of Flegm, Wind and Water, 
and eases the vehement Pains 
thereof: You may use half an 
Ounce at a time, or more, an 
hour or an hour and an half 
before bed-time; it purges 
strongly by the Nose all watry 
humors; helps the Lethargy 
and noise in the Ears, and brings 
away Catarrhs. 
 
X. The Temples being bathed 
therewith, and then linnen 
Cloaths dipt in the same, and 
applyed to the part, gives 
present ease in the most vehement 
Headach, allays the force 
of Frenzies and Madness, takes 
away Watchings and Restlessness, 
and provokes Sleep and Quietness. 
 
XI. Lastly, after due purging, 
it cures the Gonorrhœa in Men, 
and the Whites in Women, being 
injected into the Yard or Womb 
with a fit Syringe, five or six 
times a day. Price twelve pence 
an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. II. 
 
Aqua Bezoatica, Our Cordial or 
Plague Water.}] 
 
I. TAke Virginia snake root, 
Contrayerva, Zedoary, of 
each six Ounces: Cinnamon, four 
Ounces, Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, 
Cubebs, Cardamoms, Caraways, 
Bay-Berries, Juniper-Berries, 
Gentian, Winter-Cinnamon, 
Jamaica Pepper, Black Pepper, 
Ginger, of each three Ounces: Saffron, 
Cochenele, Limon Peels, Orange 
Peels (the yellow only) of each two 
Ounces: Rosemary and Lavender 
Flowers, Angelica, Bawm, Mint, 
Pennyroyal, Sage, Savory, Time, 
Sweet Marjoram, of each three 
handfuls: Spirit of Wine three 
gallons: bruise what are to be 
bruised, and digest all together for 
twelve or fourteen days: then put 
thereto white Wine four Gallons: 
distil all in a proper Alembick with 
its refrigeratory, and draw off three 
gallons of pure Spirit, which reserve: 
then change the Receiver and draw 
off two Gallons of a Cordial water, 
which keep by it self, and make one 
half of it into a syrup with fine Sugar. 
Then take Venice Treacle, 
Mithridate of each three pounds and 
a half, which dissolve in the above 
reserved Spirit: digest twenty days, 
shaking it two or three times a day; 
then let it settle, and decant off the 
clear Tincture: to the Magma put 
the other half of the Cordial Water, 
mix, digest and shake it for 
twenty days, then decant and mix 
it with the former Tincture. Mix 
these Tinctures with the above prepared 
Syrup and keep them in a Glass 
close stopt for use. This if you so 
please you may perfume with Musk, 
Ambergrise of each a Scruple. 
 
II. This Water is good in 
Sadness, Melancholy; and dejection 
of Mind; is profitable 
against Pains and afflictions of 
the Spleen and Hypochondres. 
It is a very great Cordial, revives 
all the Spirits, exhilarates, and 
makes merry a sad and drooping 
Heart. 
 
[^p.6^] 
III. It powerfully resists Poyson, 
Plague, small-Pox, and 
all sorts of malign Feavers: it 
cures the biting of all sorts of 
Serpents and other venemous 
Beasts: it strongly provokes the 
Terms, and is of profitable use 
in the fits of the Mother. 
 
IV. It is a good Stomachick, 
comforts the Head, Brain, Nerves 
and Bowels, by warming 
them: it causes a good Appetite 
to Food, and a strong Digestion, 
by strengthning the internal 
faculties of the Stomach, expelling 
Wind, easing the Colick, 
and taking away sickness at 
Heart and Stomach. 
 
V. It is a very admirable thing 
against Diseases of the Head and 
Nerves, as Head-ach, Megrims, 
Vertigo's, Lethargies, dulness, 
Drowsiness, Palsies, Apoplexies, 
and the like: and it may be of 
good use to be continually drunk 
by such as are affected with the 
Falling Sickness, or have any Distemper 
proceeding from cold 
and moisture of the Brain. 
 
VI. It is very profitable against 
the stupefaction of the Senses, 
Catarrhs, defluxions of Rheum, 
Rheumatisms, Faintings, Swoonings, 
suffocation of the Womb, 
or Fits of the Mother: it provokes 
Urine, and is very good 
against the Stone, Gravel, or Slime 
in the Reins and Bladder. 
 
VII. This Water is Sudorifick, 
Alexipharmick, and Antefebritick; 
it is powerful against all 
sorts of Pestilential Feavers, as 
also against Hecticks, and Consumptions. 
It is a Cordial, 
Cephalick and Neurotick, and 
a great Restaurative: it opens 
Obstructions, attenuates, and is 
excellent against all cold and 
moist Diseases. 
 
VIII. It cures the biting of 
Mad Dogs, expels the Poyson of 
Vegetables or Animals, quickens 
the Senses, restores the decays 
of Nature, comforts the Brain, 
clears the Eye-sight, repairs the 
weakness of the Memory, and 
brings again the lost Speech. 
 
IX. This Water is good also 
against Surfeits, Coughs, Colds, 
Catarrhs, &c. It is excellent 
against Pains and Stitches of the 
Sides, and is prevalent against a 
Pleurisie (more especially being 
mixt with equal parts of our 
Guttæ Vitæ or Cordial drops) 
being Anodyne and causing rest. 
 
X. The Dose and manner of 
using it. You may give from 
half a spoonful to two spoonfuls, 
or more at a time, in the Morning 
fasting; a little before Dinner, 
and at night going to Bed. 
It may also be taken in the same 
Dose, at any time of the Day 
or Night, upon any Fainting, 
Swooning, or sickness at Stomach, 
or if any other emergent occasion 
requires it. Price six Pence 
an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. III. 
 
Catharticum Argenteum, Or our 
Silver Purge.}] 
 
I. TAke of the best native Cinnabar 
reduced into fine 
Powder, five Ounces: fine Silver 
in Leaves, an ounce and a half: 
the best Copper in small Filings a 
drachm and an half: dissolve each 
[^p.7^] 
apart in double Aqua fortis, or the 
best Spirit of Nitre: make a precipitation 
of the Calces, which you 
shall free from the corrosive Spirits 
of the A. F. or Spirit of Nitre 
according to Art. These Calces 
dissolve again apart in Spirit of 
Honey, or Spirit of Salt; precipitate 
again and sweeten as aforesaid; from 
which being mixed together, you 
shall three times burn off rectified 
Spirit of Wine. The Calces thus 
sweetned and dryed, you shall put 
into a Glass Matrass, upon which 
you shall affuse our universal Menstruum 
fourteen Ounces (which is 
the Menstruum of the World, and 
a true dissolvent;) set them in a 
philosophick heat, or the Fire of 
Nature, for twenty four Hours; 
so will it radically dissolve the 
Calces, and bring them into their 
first matter: this Dissolution decant, 
filter, and keep it for use. Vpon 
the remaining Calx undissolved (if 
any be) affuse more of the Menstruum, 
which digest, decant and 
filter as aforesaid. Thus continuing 
the affusion of new Menstruum, 
so long till the whole Calx is dissolved, 
you will have at last, an almost 
colourless, smelless, tastless Liquor, 
especially if it be mixt with any 
other Vehicle. 
 
II. Here is to be noted, that 
this Menstruum adds little of 
vertue to the Medicine, but only 
by accident, as more perfectly 
dissolving and opening the Bodies 
of those several Calces, whereby 
their potestates or powers more 
easily mingle themselves with the 
sanguineous mass, and thereby fix 
their Character upon the habit 
of the whole Body. 
 
III. By means of this Menstruum, 
the purging of the Medicine 
is not only certain, but 
determined to a certain time; 
for whereas without this Dissolution, 
the Particles of the Calx 
might too closely adhere to the 
Tunicles of the Stomach, causing 
a continual working, sometimes 
for two, three or four days together; 
now no such thing can 
be, by reason of this liquid form, 
whereby it is seldom known to 
work above two, three or four 
hours at most. 
 
IV. If the Stomach be foul, 
it will cleanse it, and work gently 
both by Vomit and Stool; if 
the Stomach be not foul, it only 
works downwards; if it be given 
in a small Dose, it works neither 
upward nor downwards; and yet 
by a constant taking it for some 
time, as 2,3, or 4. Months, it 
cures almost incurable Diseases, 
without any manifest alteration. 
 
V. In all chronick Diseases, it 
ought to be used, (as well as for 
Purging) in a dietetick way, constantly 
giving of it in a few drops, 
as two, three, four, six, eight or 
ten, as is hereafter expressed, 
and five or six times a day, by 
which means it insensibly alters 
the whole habit of the Body, and 
may indeed serve instead of many 
other Diets in these very cases: 
for this is very certain, 
That unless the whole habit be 
absolutely altered, no cure can 
be expected; for the cure in such 
Diseases, always follows the alteration 
of the habit, as every 
Man experienced in Physick does 
sufficiently know. 
 
VI. This Silver-Purge opens 
all Obstructions of the Bowels, 
[^p.8^] 
as Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Reins, 
Womb, Mesentery, and lacteal 
Veins: but here is to be noted, 
That it ought to be given in Obstructions 
of the Lungs for twelve 
or sixteen days, in such a proportion, 
as it may neither vomit 
nor purge, and that in all the Liquor 
the sick drinks, five or six 
times aday. In other cases you 
may give it in the largest proportion, 
that is fit for the Age 
and strength of the person. 
 
VII. It cures Agues and Feavers 
of all sorts, at two, three 
or four times taking, and I have 
oftentimes cured an Ague with 
it, at once taking, yea Tertians 
and Quartans. 
 
VIII. It is a most specifick Remedy 
for the cure of most chronick 
Distempers, as hypochondriack 
Melancholy, Quartans, 
pains of the Stomach, swelling 
of the Liver and Spleen, Cachexies, 
Greensickness, stoppage 
of the Terms, &c. 
 
IX. It cures almost all Diseases 
of the Head, as Headach, 
Megrim, Frenzy, Madness, Fallingsickness, 
Apoplexies, Convulsions, 
Palsies, Lethargies, 
Vertigoes, and other like Distempers 
of the Brain. 
 
X. It carries off the impurities 
of the Stomach, cleanses the 
Blood, restores it to its course 
and circulation, cherishes the 
Heart, revives the vital Spirits, 
restores the functions of all the 
Parts, adding to the Body strength 
and vigour. 
 
XI. It perfectly cures the Gout, 
given in the paroxysm, so as it 
may not work; but when the 
Paroxysm or Fit is over, so as that 
it may work strongly; exhibiting 
also every Night (in the intervals 
of purging) a Dose of our 
Cordial Pills, in Chap. 50 following. 
 
XII. It cures the Scurvy, 
Dropsie, and Kings-Evil, almost 
to a Miracle, so also the Jaundice, 
Sciatica, Worms, Rickets, 
in Children, Consumptions occasioned 
through manifold Obstructions, 
Fits of the Mother, 
and most other stubborn Diseases 
not to be cured by vulgar Medicines. 
 
XIII. It is also eminently good 
in the cure of all running Sores, 
old Ulcers, Fistula's, Pox, &c. 
in any part of the Body, or proceeding 
from what cause soever. 
It cleanses the Body, discharges 
it of its Feculencies, and removes 
or destroys the most pernicious 
symptoms. 
 
XIV. The Dose and manner of 
taking it. It is commonly given 
either as a Diet, whereby the 
Body is only altered; or with an 
intention to purge. If as a Diet, 
give two, three, four, six, 
eight or ten drops at a time, four, 
five or six times a day, in Beer, 
Ale or Wine, according as the 
sick is in Age and Strength. 
 
XV. If it be given with an 
intention to purge, give to Infants 
(quoad capax) from five to ten 
drops. To Children of four, six, 
eight, ten or twelve years of 
Age, from ten to fifteen drops. 
To Youth, from ten to sixteen 
years of Age, from fifteen to 
twenty drops. From sixteen or 
eighteen to forty fifty or sixty 
years of Age, from fifty to a 
hundred drops; which is from 
[^p.9^] 
about four scruples, to a drachm 
and half, or two drachms, always 
observing this, to increase 
the dose every time, till you find 
it works enough. 
 
XVI. Give it in Broth, Beer, 
Ale, or Wine, and that every 
fourth, fifth, or sixth day, in 
the morning fasting; having some 
broth, mace Ale, or Posset-drink 
to take after it: being mixt with 
its vehicle, no stomach can refuse 
it. One ounce will make 
four, six, eight or ten several 
doses, according to the sex, years, 
and strength of the Patient. 
Price five shillings an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. IV. 
 
Tinctura Corallorum composita, 
Tincture of Coral Compound.}] 
 
I. TAke levigated powder of 
Coral, affuse thereon most 
sharp Spirit of Honey (made of 
Honey p. j. sand p. ij. distilled in 
a sand Furnace) and in twenty four 
hours the Spirit will be tinged of a 
deep yellow: decant, and put on 
more Spirit of Honey, and digest 
as before, reiterating this till it 
will tinge no more: then filter the 
Tinctures, and gently distil off the 
Spirit to dryness: upon the dry matter 
put the best rectified Spirit of 
Wine, which digest till it is red: 
decant and put on fresh, digesting 
to dryness as before; this reiterate 
till all the Tincture is extracted. 
Filtrate these Tinctures, and abstract 
the Spirit by distillation; then 
upon the magma affuse new Spirit 
of Wine, so will you have a pure 
Tincture, as deep as the redest Wine 
and throughly transparent. 2. Take 
a quarter (of the weight of Coral) 
of pure Oriental Bezoar: Levigate 
it into a most subtil Powder, and 
make a strong Tincture thereof, in 
the same manner, as before you 
made the Tincture of Coral. These 
two Tinctures reserve. 3. Take an 
eighth part (of the weight of Coral) 
of Saffron, and with the highest 
rectified Spirit of Wine extract a 
very strong and deep tincture in six 
or seven days; filtrate it, and then 
mix it with the reserved tincture of 
Coral and Bezoar; digest and circulate 
twenty days, then filtrate it 
again through brown Paper: so 
will you have a glorious transparent 
tincture, and as red as Blood, which 
keep in a Glass close stopped for use. 
 
II. You may also otherwise extract 
a tincture of Coral, by digesting 
the levigated powder thereof in 
Oyl of Citrons or Limons; which 
being tinged, you may draw off the 
Oyl, and with the best rectified 
Spirit of Wine, or Spirit of Wine 
nitrated, or vitriolated (viz. by 
digesting equal parts of S.V. and 
Oyl of Vitriol together, and distilling 
in an Alembick in sand with a 
gentle fire, and then with a stronger, 
that they may pass together, reiterating 
this thrice, and then circulating 
for forty days:) you may draw the 
pure red tincture of Coral, for the 
purpose aforesaid. 
 
III. This compound tincture 
of Coral is so strong and powerful, 
that it takes away all Impurities 
from the blood whatsoever, 
is a great Cordial, and of Wonderful 
Virtue against all diseases 
proceeding of putrefaction, being 
used for some days: it is so 
wonderful an enemy to putrefaction, 
[^p.10^] 
that it is scarcely possible 
for any impurity to remain 
in the Blood. 
 
IV. It is a great Vulnerary 
and Traumatick, curing all curable 
wounds at once dressing, 
and therefore is of extraordinary 
use in spitting of Blood, especially 
if it be caused from the rupture 
of a Vein: it revives the Spirits, 
cheers the Heart, and mightily 
restores in Consumptions. 
 
V. It is of singular use in 
burning and malignant Fevers, 
as the Measles, small Pox, Calenture, 
spotted Fever and the 
Plague, being as it were a Balsom 
of Life, and vital Powers, 
exalting nature to her highest 
Degree, by quickning the native 
Fire and Heat. 
 
VI. It is of good use in Hecticks, 
rectifies, distempers of 
the Head, cures Apoplexies, 
Epilepsies, Convulsions, Lethargies, 
Vertigo's, and such like: 
It prevails also against diseases of 
the stomach and heart, as in 
digestion, want of Appetite, 
Loathing, Vomiting, Fainting 
Swooning, Palpitation, sickness 
of Heart and melancholy habit 
and disposition of Body. 
 
VII. It is so great a de-obstructer, 
that it cures the Rickets 
in Children (their joynts also 
being bathed with Powers of 
Amber) and is found by experience 
to be admirable to comfort 
and warm the Stomach and 
Womb, and to cure a Chlorosis 
or Green sickness, and Cachexia. 
 
VIII. And as it extinguishes 
the preternatural heat of Fevers; 
so also it comforts the natural 
powers, restores the radical 
moisture, fortifies the Spirits, 
and gives relief in Deliriums, 
Frenzy, Madness, Obstructions 
of the Terms, Wind in the 
Bowels and Womb, &c. 
 
IX. The Dose and way of taking 
of it. You may give from ten 
drops, to thirty, forty or sixty, 
as the sick is in years and strength: 
and you may give it in white 
Wine, Sherry, or Canary, or 
in any proper Cordial water; 
and that three, four, five or six 
times a day, as you see occasion. 
Price five shillings an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. V. 
 
Tinctura stomachica nostra; Our 
stomachick tincture.}] 
 
TAke tincture of Salt of Tartar, 
tincture of Antimony, 
of each a pound: black Pepper 
in fine Pouder eight ounces: 
Cardamoms in pouder & Camphir, of 
each two ounces, digest them in the 
said tinctures for forty days in a 
Glass close stopt, shaking it once 
or twice every day, then being well 
settled, decant the clear Liquor, 
which filtrate through brown Paper; 
so will you have a glorious, transparent, 
blood red tincture, of almost 
infinite Virtues, which keep 
in a Glass close stopt for Use. 
 
II. This tincture receives its 
name from its admirable property 
of warming, comforting, and 
strengthning the stomach, taking 
away stomach-sickness, and pains 
there, loathing, vomiting, indigestion, 
want of appetite, and 
wind in the same, and parts adjacent. 
 
[^p.11^] 
III. It is a most excellent thing 
to sweeten the Blood, open all 
Obstructions of the inward parts, 
as of the Liver, Spleen, Lungs, 
Womb, Reins, and Bladder. 
It brings down the Terms obstructed, 
and is powerful against 
the Green-sickness, Dropsie, 
Jaundice, Consumption, Asthma, 
Pleurisie, Melancholy, Ulcers, 
inward and outward, Scabs, and 
other Breakings out. 
 
IV. It is of admirable use against 
all sorts of Fevers, continual, 
putrid, and Pestilential, as 
Measles, small Pox, spotted 
Fever and Calenture; it represses 
the exorbitance of the Fever, 
takes away all the Symptoms, and 
causes rest and ease. It is singular 
against the Plague, and all other 
Diseases arising from sharpness 
and obstructions of the humours, 
or stagnation of the Blood. 
 
V. It is an excellent remedy 
in all cases of putrefaction of the 
Blood and Humours; prevails 
against Rheumatisms and Gouts, 
cuts tough flegm, and dissolves 
Tartarous matter, lodging in the 
Ventricle: it is good against 
sighing and sadness, pains and 
stitches in the sides, and helps 
Trembling and Palpitation of the 
Heart. 
 
VI. As this tincture is a notable 
Apetitive, so it works all its 
effects powerfully, yet with a 
World of sweetness and pleasure; 
it opens obstructions in the Pancreas, 
Mesentery, and Meseraick 
Veins, dissolves the stagnation 
of the Blood, and all the most 
tenacious Viscosities wheresoever 
in any part of the Body, most 
potently provoking the Terms, 
if given for some days according 
to Art. 
 
VII. It provokes Urine, and 
is good against Gravel, Slime, 
and Viscous matter both in Reins 
and Bladder, purifying the whole 
Mass of Blood, and taking away 
the malignity of the humours, in 
any disease whatsoever, especially 
in the Kings-Evil, scirrhose and 
Leprose tumours, &c. in so much 
that there is scarcely the like general 
remedy in the whole Art of 
Physick. 
 
VIII. It hastens and facilitates 
the Birth, and brings away the 
Secundine or after-birth, yea the 
child although dead. It is a present 
remedy against the Colick 
and after-pains, as also in the 
Gripings of the Guts and Bowels, 
more especially if it be mixt 
with equal parts of our Guttæ Vitæ, 
or Cordial drops. 
 
IX. I cured with this tincture 
a certain Woman of an inveterate 
pining and wasting, a supposed 
incurable Consumption, accompanied 
with vehement dolors 
of the Bowels, after a two years 
despair, when she was so weak 
she could not stand alone without 
two to hold her, looking like 
(as it were) the picture of Death, 
and given over as past hopes, by 
several able and learned Men. 
 
X. She alone taking of this 
Medicine in Sack, or Milk, or 
Ale sweetned, but most commonly 
in Milk, morning, noon, 
and night, and sometimes five 
or six times a day (drinking no 
drink without it) for about a 
month or five weeks time, was 
restored to the wonder of all that 
knew her. 
 
[^p.12^] 
XI. The Dose of it is, so much 
as will make the Vehicle as hot 
as the sick can well endure it: 
you may give from ten drops to 
twenty, thirty or more, as you 
see occasion, viz. five, six or seven 
times a day. It may also be 
given in some proper Syrup or 
Julep. Price two shillings six pence 
an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. VI. 
 
Tinctura Bezoartica nostra; 
Our Cordial or Bezoartick Tincture.}] 
 
TAke Carpobalsamum eight Ounces: 
Virginean snakeroot, Contrayerva, 
Zedoary, biting Cinnamon, 
Winters bark, Bayberries, of 
each four Ounces. Cloves, Mace, 
Nutmegs, Opium, of each one 
Ounce: Saffron, Cochenele, Ginger, 
of each half an ounce, bruise what 
are to be bruised, and affuse thereon 
rectified Spirit of Wine nitrated 
a Gallon: digest twenty days, shaking 
it two or three times a day; 
then letting it well settle, decant the 
pure clear tincture, in which dissolve 
Camphir two ounces: keep it 
in a Glass close stopt for use. You 
may if you please prepare it with 
tincture of Salt of Tartar instead 
of the restified Spirit of Wine, and 
it will be yet more excellent and 
powerful, but a great deal the 
dearer. 
 
II. This tincture is Cephalick, 
stomachick, Cardiack and Hysterick; 
also sudorifick, carminative, 
alexipharmick, diuretick, 
and Anodyne. It is a notable 
Antifebritick, and powerfully 
resists the force of burning, malignant, 
and pestilential Fevers, 
as the Fever Causos, Measles, small 
Pox, Purples, Spotted Fever, 
Calenture, sweating sickness and 
Plague. 
 
III. It is singularly good against 
hypochondriack Melancholy, 
Quartans, and other Chronick 
diseases of like kind; it is 
an Antidote against all sorts of 
Poysons, the bitings of mad Dogs, 
Serpents, Vipers, and other Venomous 
creatures: and is good 
to kill worms in Children. 
 
IV. It mightily strengthens 
and comforts the animal Spirits, 
fortifies the Brain, and cures all 
diseases thereof, proceeding from 
cold and moisture, or a flux of 
flegmatick and viscous humours 
to the same, as the Apoplexy, 
Falling-sickness, Lethargy, Carus, 
drowsiness, dulness, sleepiness, 
Headachs, Megrims, Vertigoes, 
Convulsions, Palsies, and 
other diseases of like kind. 
 
V. Drawn up the Nostrils it 
gently purges and cleanses the 
Head of cold, moist and pituitous 
humours, and makes a great 
evacuation by the Pallat and 
Nose, and so used (as well as 
taken inwardly) it is very profitable 
against all the aforenamed 
diseases of the Head. 
 
VI. It revives and restores the 
Vital Spirits, chears the Heart, 
strengthens the Bowels, revives 
languishing Nature, and fortifies 
the whole Body: It is excellent 
good in Consumptions, hecticks, 
faintings, tremblings, Palpitation 
of the Heart, with other 
Cardiack passions. 
 
VII. It marvellously strengthens 
[^p.13^] 
the stomach, warms and comforts 
it, provokes Appetite, helps 
Digestion, and takes away nauseousness, 
loathing and Vomiting: 
and is of singular good 
use for such as are affected with 
a vehement pain in that bowel. 
 
VIII. It is profitable against 
fits of the Mother, fainting and 
Swooning; it cleanses, warms, 
comforts and strengthens the 
Womb; and being often and 
long taken by Barren Women, 
who are of a soft, cold and moist 
constitution, it takes away that 
indisposition, and causes fruitfulness. 
 
XI. It provokes sweat powerfully, 
and expells all manner of 
Venom, poyson, and malignity 
through the pores of the skin: 
It expells Wind from all parts 
of the Body, yea, from the 
Veins and Arteries; it gives present 
ease in the Colick, Griping 
and Wind in the stomach and 
bowels, and refreshes all the 
Viscera. 
 
X. It provokes Urine and the 
Terms, facilitates both birth and 
after-birth, takes away afterpains 
in Child-bed Women, clears 
the passages of the Urine, and 
expels sand or gravel, and slime, 
from the Reins, Ureters, and 
Bladder. 
 
XI. The Dose and way of taking 
it. As a preservative you may take 
a quarter of a spoonful of something 
less of it in the morning 
fasting; a little before dinner; 
and last at night going to bed. 
Curatively, give it when and as 
often as the exigence requires; 
and if it be the Plague, or any 
other malign Fever, let the sick 
be in bed, and well covered; 
then give it from a quarter of 
a spoonful to half a Spoonful, in 
a Glass of Sack, burnt White-Wine, 
or some proper Julep; 
reiterate it in like manner for 
three or four days at least; and 
after give a quarter of a spoonful 
every morning and night. For 
fainting, Swooning, &c. give it 
at the time of the Fit. Price 
twelve pence an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. VII. 
 
Tinctura Hysterica, Our Tincture 
against Fits.}] 
 
I. TAke powers of Amber five 
pints: Castoreum in fine 
powder, Horse hoofs, or Ox horns 
rasped, of each six ounces: mix 
and digest forty days in a warm 
Balneo Mariæ, shaking the Glass 
two or three times a day: then being 
setled, decant the clear tincture, 
and keep it for use. You may make 
this tincture also, with tincture of 
Salt of Tartar, or tincture of Antimony, 
as you please your self. 
 
II. This was invented against 
those called Hysterick Fits; viz. 
Suffocation, or Fits of the Mother, 
for which it is a most admirable 
thing (and has indeed 
scarcely any equal.) 
 
III. It is not only of wonderful 
force against Fits of the Mother, 
but also against the Colick, 
Wind, Vertigo, Megrim, Falling-sickness, 
Palsie, Apoplexie, 
Trembling, Palpitation of the 
Heart, Carus, Lethargy, obstructions 
and weaknesses of the 
Head, Brain, Nerves and Womb. 
 
[^p.14^] 
IV. It quickens the Senses, 
revives the Spirits, attenuates, 
opens, discusses, strengthens, 
resists poyson, provokes Urine 
and the Terms: being held in the 
mouth, it helps the Tooth-ach, 
and being taken inwardly, or 
outwardly bathed with it, is a 
most admirable thing to ease 
pains. 
 
V. It is a most powerful 
thing to cause Sweat, and as 
good a sudorifick as is ordinarily 
to be met with, expelling 
Tartarous Diseases, as the Scurvy, 
Pox, Dropsy, Jaundice, 
Gout, Rheumatism, &c. It expells 
Wind in any part, and by 
its balsamick virtue resists putrefaction, 
expelling the Malignity 
of the Measles, small Pox, 
spotted Fever, Plague, Poyson, 
biting of mad Dogs, &c. 
 
VI. It is found be experience 
to open the most inveterate obstructions 
of the Womb, and 
Mesentery, as also of the Liver, 
Spleen and Bowels, and therefore 
is profitably given in the 
Cachexia, green Sickness in 
Virgins, Rickets in Children, as 
also to kill worms whether in old 
or young. 
 
VII. The Dose and manner of 
taking it. You may give it in 
White or Rhenish-wine, or in 
Sherry or Canary, according to 
the intention; or in any proper 
Syrup, or Julep: give it out of 
the Fit, in the morning fasting, 
and last at night going to bed: 
but if any Fit comes, give it in 
the time of the Fit. The dose 
is from twenty drops to forty, 
sixty or more, according to age 
and strength. Price half a Crown 
an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. VIII. 
 
Tinctura cathartica nostra. Our 
purging Tincture.}] 
 
I. TAke the Spirit of Juniper, 
Aniseeds or Caraways five 
quarts, choice Sena twenty ounces: 
Powder of Jalap five ounces: mix 
them, and digest in a warm Balneo 
Mariæ eight or ten days, shaking 
the Glass two or three times a day: 
then being settled, decant the clear 
tincture for use. This tincture may 
also be made with tincture of Salt 
of Tartar, or tincture of Antimony. 
 
II. It is an exceeding good 
thing against all Chronick, hypochondriack 
diseases, as Dropsies, 
Jaundices, Scurvy, Gout, 
and head-achs, Megrims, Vertigo's, 
lethargies, dullness, and 
drousiness, and other cold and 
moist distempers of the Head 
and Brain. 
 
III. It powerfully opens obstructions 
and takes away pains 
of the Liver, Spleen, Mesentery 
and Womb; is good against 
nauseousness, Loathing and Vomiting, 
and cleanses a foul stomach, 
causing a good Appetite 
and Digestion, opening, cleansing 
and comforting all those 
parts. 
 
IV. It cures Gouts, Rheumatisms, 
Kings-evil, Cachexia, 
and other stubborn and rebellious 
diseases: it prevails powerfully 
against loathing in Virgins, the 
green Sickness, and other like 
distempers incident to that sex, 
and so admirably takes them away, 
that they never return 
gain. 
 
[^p.15^] 
V. It is a very excellent thing 
to cure all hard, difficult, and 
chronick diseases, and is profitably 
given in the Pox, Gonorrhœa, 
Scabs, Leprosies, Morphew, 
old and running sores, Ulcers, 
Fistulaes, Hypochondriack Melancholy, 
and other like inveterate 
and malign diseases. 
 
VI. It takes away the causes 
in Fits of the Mother, and is so 
great a thing against the Scurvy, 
that it has but few equals: for 
it purges admirably, and powerfully 
evacuates all watery humours 
by stool, after a pleasant 
and wonderful manner. 
 
VI. It purges all humours even 
to a Miracle, but chiefly 
such as are watery, things viscous, 
and Melancholy, and is 
of exceeding use to such as are 
itchy, mangy, or Leprous, or 
have old filthy running sores about 
them, especially in the 
Leggs, and parts depending. It 
removes Scabs, and Venereal 
botches, and mightily facilitates 
the cure of the French Pox, being 
given after the use of Mercurials. 
 
VIII It provokes Urine, and 
potently brings away whatever 
obstructs the passages of the Urine 
in the Reins, Ureters or Bladder, 
as Gravel, Sand, Slime and viscous 
humours. It also empties 
the stomach and bowels of all 
their filth, cleanses like Soap, 
and performs even desperate 
Cures. 
 
IX. The Dose and manner of taking 
it. You may give of it from 
half a spoonful, to a spoonful, 
two spoonfuls, or more, as you 
see occasion, respecting also the 
Age and strength of the Sick 
to Children and weak persons, 
you must give but a small dose; 
to elder and stronger persons a 
greater: give it in a Glass of Ale 
or White-wine sweetned with 
Sugar, or mix it with a little 
Syrup, and so take it. Let it be, 
given in the morning fasting, 
drinking warm broth, mace-Ale 
or possetdrink after it, and keeping 
warm; as in taking other Purges: 
and let it be repeated twice 
a week or more as need requires. 
Price twelve pence an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. IX. 
 
Guttæ vitæ Nostræ; Our cordial 
Drops.}] 
 
I. TAke the best Philosophick Spirit 
of Wine, or tincture of Salt 
of Tartar, or tincture of Antimony, 
five quarts; Or take Powers of 
Cloves, Carraways, Aniseeds, Limons 
and Rosemary, of each a quart: 
mix them together, and put it in 
five Glasses, holding somewhat more 
than a quart a piece, into each 
Glass a quart. Into the first Glass 
put Theban Opium ten ounces, dissolved 
in a part of the same Powers. 
Into the second Glass put 
Saffron and Cochinele (the latter in 
fine powder) of each one ounce. Into 
the third put Castoreum, freed 
from skins and fat, and reduced 
into powder, two ounces. Into the 
fourth put Cloves and Nutmegs in 
powder, of each an ounce. Into 
the fifth put Virginean snakeroot 
bruised, Zedoary in gross powder, 
of each one ounce. Digest all several 
a month in a place neither hot 
[^p.16^] 
nor cold, shaking them twice a day. 
Then let the Opium stand three days 
without shaking (as also the tincture 
of Saffron, &c.) Decant the 
clear Opiate tincture into a great 
Glass holding about six quarts, 
which reserve. To the Magma of 
the Opium, put the clear decanted 
tincture of Saffron, shake them well 
together twice a day for three days, 
then let the Glass stand, (as also 
the third Glass containing the tincture 
of Castor) three days without 
shaking, after which decant 
the clear tincture of the Saffron 
from the Opiate Magma, and put 
it to the tincture of Opium in the 
great Glass. To the Opiate Magma 
put the clear decanted tincture 
of Castor, which shake well together 
twice a day for three days; 
then let the Glass stand (as also the 
fourth Glass containing the tincture 
of Cloves, &c.) three days, without 
shaking; after which decant 
the clear tincture of the Castor, and 
put it to the tincture of Opium in 
the great Glass as aforesaid. To the 
Opiate Magma put the clear decanted 
tincture of Cloves, which shake 
well together twice a day for three 
days; then let the Glass stand (as 
also the fifth Glass containing the 
tincture of Virginean Snakeroot, 
&c.) three days without shaking; 
after which decant the clear tincture 
of Cloves, and put it to the tincture 
of Opium in the great Glass, as 
before. Lastly, to the Opiate Magma, 
put the clear decanted tincture 
of Virginean Snakeroot, which 
shake together twice a day for three 
days; then let it stand three days 
without shaking; decant the clear 
tincture, and put it to the former, 
the which keep in a Glass close stopped. 
In this mixt tincture dissolve 
Narcotick Sulphur of Vitriol one 
ounce: choice Camphire five ounces: 
shake them, digest ten days, and 
keep the whole in a Glass bottle, 
close stopt for use. 
 
II. This medicament is as well 
a preservative from, as a cure 
for, all pestilential and infectious 
diseases: it preserves health, represses 
Melancholy, causes chearfulness, 
and cures the bitings or 
stingings of any Mad Dog, Serpent, 
Viper, or other poysonous 
creature, and powerfully 
expells poyson. 
 
III. It cures the Vertigo, Epilepsy, 
Apoplexy, Palsy, Trembling, 
Depravation of the Senses, 
Frenzy, Madness, want of Sleep 
and Rest, inveterate pains of 
the Head, Megrim, suddain 
Coughs, Colds, Asthma's, difficulty 
of breathing, bleeding in 
any part, Spitting of Blood, sickness 
at stomach, Palpitation, 
swooning, and other passions of 
the Heart. 
 
IV. It is a most admirable thing 
against the Colick, Griping of 
the Guts, Wind, pain of the 
stomach and Spleen, Illiack passion, 
sharp and corroding humours 
in the Bowels, and all 
other pains whatsoever: It cures 
a Diarrhœa, Dysenteria, and 
Lienteria, the flux of the Liver, 
overflowing of the Terms, 
and Whites in Women; and is a 
famous remedy to prevent miscarriage. 
 
V. It is of good use against 
Scabs, Psora, Leprosie and elephantiasis, 
by taking away the 
acrimony of the humours, sweetning 
the Blood, and expelling 
[^p.17^] 
the filth and malignity thereof 
through the Pores of the skin; 
for it powerfully provokes sweat, 
being taken last at night going 
to bed. 
 
VI. It chears the Heart, revives 
the Spirits, makes a glad 
Soul, strengthens the whole Body, 
comforts the Stomach, helps 
Appetite and indigestion, removes 
Languishing, corroborates 
the faculties, restores wastings, 
and decays of Nature, is 
profitable against pining, and 
cures a lingring Consumption, if 
taken in due time, or before the 
Patient is past cure. 
 
VII It is so good a thing against 
spitting of Blood, pissing 
of Blood, bleeding at the Nose, 
and all other fluxes of Blood in 
any part of the Body, that there 
is scarcely any thing superiour to 
it, and therefore is found to be 
profitable in all Consumptive 
weaknesses, Phthisicks, Ulcers, of 
the Lungs, &c. 
 
VIII. It is good against the 
Stone and Gravel, slime, filth, 
and Viscous humours in the Reins, 
Ureters and Bladder, for it gives 
present ease and rest, provokes 
Urine, and takes away the heat 
and sharpness thereof; cures the 
Dysuria, Ischuria, and strangury, 
helps Ulcers of the Bladder, 
strengthens the Genitals, and 
after an admirable manner, 
assists and fortifies nature. 
 
IX. I have given these Drops 
in the Measles and small Pox with 
singular advantages; I have given 
them to near two hundred 
Children in the small Pox, as 
also to elder persons both Men 
and Women, and always with so 
good success, that no one has yet 
dy'd under my Hand of those distempers, 
who have assiduously 
taken them according to my order 
and directions. 
 
X. They are of most excellent 
use for all such as are troubled 
with Gouts, whether in Hands, 
Arms, Hips, Knees, Leggs or 
Feet; as also for all such as are 
afflicted with vehement and painful 
Rheumatisms, pains from the 
Scurvy, or Pox, Sciatica's, Quartan 
Agues, and other Melancholy, 
cold and moist diseases arising 
from sharp, Vitious, and Tartarous 
humours: they give ease 
upon the Spot. 
 
XI. They are also very powerful 
in many affects of the 
Womb; they cure weaknesses, 
Whites, Gonorrhœas, and other 
Lassitudes of those parts, after 
due purging. They prevail against 
all vehement pains of the 
sides, Stitches, Pleurisies, and 
such as languish from poysons 
formerly given, labour under 
Hecticks, and the most intolerable 
pains. 
 
XII. These Cordial drops restore 
radical moisture, comforting 
every member and part of 
Mans Body: they cure the toothach, 
and Pains in the Ears, and 
the like, being held in the mouth, 
and dropt into the pained Ear. 
They are also an excellent remedy 
against vehement Vomiting, 
stopping it in an Instant, whether 
it proceeds from wind, cold, 
sharp humours, or surfeits. 
 
XIII. They are a preservative 
from, and cure of the Plague, 
Pestilence, spotted Feaver, Calenture, 
or any other like infectious 
[^p.18^] 
disease; and being infected 
they are a remedy beyond expectation; 
for they perform their 
operations (which is chiefly by 
sweat, and sometimes by Urine) 
with great safety, speed, dexterity, 
and ease, being fitted for 
any person of what age, sex, or 
quality soever, strengthning the 
Brain, chearing the Heart, comforting 
Nature, restoring the 
Body and reviving all the Spirits, 
Natural, Vital, and Animal. 
 
XIV. The quantity to be taken 
at a time. This is to be regulated 
according to the age of the 
sick; to a Child of a month, 
quarter, half year, or year old, 
you may give from five drops to 
ten: from a year to two, three, 
four, or five years old, you may 
give from ten to sixteen drops: 
and to elder persons from six or 
seven years of Age to twelve or 
fourteen, you may give from 
sixteen to twenty four drops: 
from fourteen years of Age to 
twenty, thirty, forty, sixty, 
eighty years and upwards, you 
may give from twenty four to 
forty, fifty, or sixty drops at a 
time, which in ordinary cases 
may be the highest dose; and may 
be safely given to women with 
Child, being excellent to prevent 
miscarriage as aforesaid. 
 
XV. The Dose and manner of 
taking them. Let them always be 
taken at night going to bed, and 
that also every night, if need 
requires: and let them be exhibited 
in Canary, or white Wine 
and Sugar, Mace-ale, or the like; 
or you may give them in a little 
Syrup, or some proper Julep, 
and so to be covered down, and to 
rest upon them. If they be taken 
for a Cough which is troublesom 
in the day time, or for 
prevention of any illness, let 
them be taken in the morning 
fasting in a Glass of Sack, and 
you need fear no hurt that day. 
Price two shillings six pence the 
Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. X. 
 
Tinctura Martis: Tincture or Extract 
of Steel.}] 
 
I. DIssolve filings of Steel in 
Oyl of Vitriol one part, 
mixed with Water two parts: filter 
it hot and crystalize: exsiccate the 
Ctrystals, stirring them continually, 
so have you a purple Crocus: extract 
therefrom a Tincture with distilled 
Vinegar; then in Balneo 
Mariæ abstract the Vinegar, and 
edulcorate the remainder, by often 
drawing from it fair Water, and 
extract with Spirit of Wine. 
 
II. Or thus: Dissolve Filings 
of Steel in purified juice of Limons, 
digest for a Month, then 
filter into a glass Vessel, and in 
a Sand heat inspissate to the consistence 
of a liquid Extract. 
 
III. Or thus: Take Filings 
of Steel one pound: Sal Armoniack 
two pound: mix and distil in a Retort, 
with a gentle Fire at first 
then with a stronger: the Magma 
remaining edulcorate by much washing: 
then put it into a Cucurbit 
and with Spirit of Wine extract 
Tincture: decant and put on new 
Spirit, till the Magma will yield 
no more Tincture; then abstract 
the half of the Spirit by an Alembick, 
[^p.19^] 
and the Tincture remaining 
filtrate through brown Paper, and 
keep it for use. 
 
IV. Or thus. Take reverberated 
Filings of Mars one pound; 
dulcified Spirit of Nitre three 
pounds; digest them together for 
two days, or till the Spirit is tinged 
of a rubicund colour; decant and 
keep it for use. 
 
V. Or thus. Take filings of 
Mars a pound; fair Water eight 
ounces; Oyl of Salt one ounce; 
digest all together two or three days, 
stirring the matter twice a day; 
then add Crystals of Tartar three 
ounces, mixed by degrees with a 
sufficient quantity of Spring Water; 
boyl all for two hours, in an 
iron Pot, always adding fresh Water, 
as the other evaporates. Being 
settled, filtrate the clear, and 
evaporate to the consistence of a thin 
Syrup; add a half part of rectified 
Spirit of Wine, and keep the Tincture 
for use. 
 
VI. Or thus. Take rust of Iron 
made by dew, twelve ounces; white 
Tartar two pounds; powder and 
mix them together, boyl them in a 
great iron Pot, with two gallons of 
rain Water for twelve hours; stir 
with an iron Spatula from time to 
time, and put in more Water (but 
boyling hot) as the former consumes; 
at length let it settle a while, so 
have you a black Liquor, which is 
the Tincture. Filtrate and evaporate 
it in an earthen Pan over a 
sand heat, to the thickness of a Syrup, 
or till a pellicule shall arise. 
 
VII. All these preparations of 
Steel are singularly good, so that 
here is scarcely any preference: 
but if one may make an Estimate, 
the third, fourth and sixth 
Recipe's are thought to have the 
precedence, the one being a 
pure red Tincture; the other a 
noble Extract, of an admirable 
sweetness in its tast, being reduced 
to such a thickness, that it 
might keep the better; but the 
three prescripts, yea, all of them 
are of one and the same vertue. 
 
VIII. The Tincture or Extract 
of Steel, is a very great 
Aperitive, opens the most inveterate 
Obstructions of the Liver, 
Spleen, Pancreas, Mesentery, 
Reins and Womb; is a most excellent 
thing against Cachexies, 
Dropsies, and stoppage of the 
Terms, for it sweetens the acid 
humor, which is the cause of all 
Obstructions. 
 
IX. It is a perfect cure for the 
green Sickness in Virgins, Rickets 
in Children, Quartan Agues, 
and hypochondriack Melancholy, 
for which last, there is scarcely 
any greater Remedy. It cures 
the Scurvy, and takes away a 
Schirrhus both of Liver and 
Spleen. It is said also to be a 
specifick against the Jaundice, 
Black and Yellow, Dropsies and 
Kings Evil. 
 
X. It takes away all Obstructions 
of the Reins. Ureters and 
Bladder. It is a powerful Remedy, 
and has a singular property 
to attenuate Atra bilis and Melancholy. 
And in all deplorable 
Diseases proceeding from corruption 
of Humors, it is a most admirable 
Remedy. It rectifies the 
Stomach, and sets it to rights, 
which is the root of most diseases 
afflicting Mankind. 
 
XI. It strengthens all the internal 
[^p.20^] 
Viscera, dissolves all coagulated 
Humours and tartarous 
matter, and has been found profitable 
against Rheumatisms, 
Gouts, the Stone, and other tartarous 
Diseases afflicting the Liver, 
Spleen or Mesentery. 
 
XII. It temperates the acrimony 
of acid humors, and performs 
all the Cures aforesaid, 
when all other Remedies are ineffectual; 
moreover it is known 
to be a specifick for killing Worms 
in Children. 'Tis indeed a noble 
Medicament, beyond thousands 
of others. 
 
XIII. The Dose and way of using 
it. The Tinctures may be given 
from ten drops to forty, and if 
they be given in a greater Dose, 
as from half a drachm to a drachm 
they move to vomit, expelling 
both Choler and Flegm; the best 
way is to begin with ten or twelve 
drops, and so to increase two 
drops every day, till it moves to 
Vomit. The last prescript may 
be given from half a drachm to 
a drachm. Let them be given in 
Beer, Ale, Wine, or some 
convenient Syrup, every morning 
fasting. Price two Shillings 
six pence an Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. XI. 
 
Tinctura Antimonii: Tincture 
of Antimony}] 
 
I. TAke of the best Antimony; 
Salt of Tartar, ana, what 
you please; melt them in a Crucible 
red hot for the space of half an hour; 
then the matter being taken out and 
freed from the fæces, whilst hot, 
let it be reduced into powder: To 
which put of the best rectified, or 
rather Philosophick Spirit of Wine, 
so much as may cover it three or 
four Inches over: digest together 
for some time, till the Tincture is 
extracted, after which evaporate 
the superfluous part of the Spirit. 
Basil. 
 
II. Or thus. Take Hyacinth 
Glass of Antimony levigated one 
ounce, Spirit of Venus three ounces, 
digest in a Glass close stopt for fourteen 
days, shaking it once or twice 
a day, till the Spirit is of a sanguineous 
Colour: decant so as it may be 
free from the fæces, and distil by 
a Retort, till it is of the thickness 
of Oyl; (some say, to dryness) 
with a gentle fire. To the rubicund 
matter at bottom put Alchool of S.V. 
or Philosophick S.V. to overtop it 
three Inches: digest in a warm place 
for ten or twelve days; then decant, 
evaporate to one half, and keep the 
remaining, (which is the true tincture 
of Antimony) close stopt for 
vse. Margrave. 
 
III. Or thus. Take Hartman's 
Sulphur of Antimony, extract a 
tincture from it with spirit of Salt, 
abstract the Spirit; and extract again 
with Philosophick S.V. or Tincture 
of salt or Tartar, till the 
tincture is deep; then abstract the 
superfluous part of the Spirit. 
Salmon. 
 
IV. Or thus. From Antimony 
in powder, extract a red Tincture 
with Spirit of Vitriol by digestion 
in Ashes; then decant and abstract 
the Spirit in B.M. with a gentle 
Fire, till the drops be yellow: to 
the remaining add S.V. rectified; 
digest, and abstract in B.M. with 
a gentle Fire, till the drops are yellow 
again. Faber. 
 
[^p.21^] 
V. Or thus. Take Vitriol calcined 
to redness, q. v. put to it the 
strongest spirit of Vinegar, digest 
three days in a gentle heat, and decant 
the Tincture: in this liquor 
put Crude Antimony q.s. digest till 
the Menstruum becomes yellow, 
decant and put on new, mix the 
Tinctures, and abstract to the thickness 
of Honey: Then extract the 
Tincture with the best rectified S.V. 
which abstract in part; keeping the 
remainder for use. Mynsicht. 
 
VI. The Tincture of Antimony 
is one of the most excellent of 
Medicines; and all these are excellent 
preparations of the same, 
and indeed the best yet known: 
but of these the first three excel. 
 
VII. It opens Obstructions, 
attenuates slime and Tartarous 
humours in any part of the Body, 
and strongly provokes sweat. 
It removes all stoppages whatsoever 
in all the principal parts, as 
Liver, Spleen, Gall, Mesentery, 
Womb, Hypochonders, 
and Bowels, and sends out the 
offending matter, by Urine, Sweat, 
and the Emunctories. It gives 
ease in the Colick, provokes 
the Terms, and cures the Green 
sickness: but these last it does 
more powerfully, if mixt with a 
fit proportion of Tincture of 
Mars. 
 
VIII. It is powerful against the 
Palsy, Apoplexy, Epilepsy, 
Vertigo, Lethargy, and all diseases 
of the Brain and Nerves, proceeding 
from Cold and Moisture; 
and cures the Plague, and all pestilential 
and malign Feavers to 
Admiration, if given in a proper 
Vehicle: and is indeed one 
of the Greatest Antifebriticks in 
the World. It provokes the 
Terms given in a fit season. 
 
IX. It may be given dietetically 
in the Leprosy and French 
Pox, in which diseases, it performs 
much more than Guajacum, 
Sarsa, and such like: For certainly 
it is one of the greatest 
purifiers of the whole mass of 
Blood, that is yet known. 
 
X. It is a specifick against Melancholy, 
Pleurisies, all sorts of 
Feavers, Coagulation of the 
Blood, Gouts, Rheumatisms, 
Scurvy, Measles, Small Pox, 
and the like, powerfully expelling 
them by Sweat. It resists 
Poyson, and is a powerful Antidote 
against all Contagion whatsoever. 
It is also an excellent 
Traumatick and Vulnerary, curing 
wounds both inward and 
outward. 
 
XI. It wonderfully strengthens 
the Heart and Stomach, restoring 
a lost Appetite, and causing digestion: 
and although a hot Medicine, 
yet it sensibly cools the 
preternatural heat of the Blood, 
as is evident, when it is given 
in all vehemently hot and burning 
Feavers, wherein the heat 
vanishes like Lightning. It is 
certainly a most excellent remedy 
against the greatest and most 
inveterate diseases. 
 
XII. It is truly a great Cordial, 
in all fainting, and swooning 
fits, sickness at Heart, cold 
Sweats, &c. vastly beyond all 
the cold slipslops vulgarly prescribed 
by Physicians. I hold it 
a most excellent thing to be given 
for a year together against 
the Gout, Kings Evil, Rheumatisms 
[^p.22^] 
Hypochondriack Melancholy, 
the Dropsy, falling Sickness; 
and other diseases which 
require a long course of Physick. 
 
XIII. The Dose and manner of 
taking it. You may give it from 
ten drops to twenty, thirty, 
forty, fifty or sixty. And when 
given to sweat, may be given 
from a dram to a dram and half: 
You may give it morning and evening 
for ten, twenty or thirty 
days together, against all acute 
Diseases: and so also against 
Chronick; but afterwards in 
Chronick Diseases you may give 
it dietetically in a smaller dose, 
You may Exhibit it for Sweating 
in Our Aqua Bezoartica; but in other 
cases where it is taken morning 
and evening, you may give 
either in the same Water, or in 
Ale, Wine, Mead, &c. The Price 
five shillings an ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. XII. 
 
Spiritus Anticolicus, seu Alcholizatus; 
Spirit against Colicks.}] 
 
I. TAke rectified Spirit of Niter 
half a pound; of the best 
rectified Spirit of Wine a pound; 
mix them together, and digest for 
forty days; then put them into a 
glass Retort with a long neck in 
Sand, applying a very capacious 
Receiver, and distill to dryness; 
first with a very gentle Fire, for 
otherwise much of the volatile Spirit 
will be lost; afterwards with a 
stronger, till all the Spirit be come 
over, The Vessel being cooled, cohobate 
the distilled Spirit, and repeat 
the cohobation three or four 
times in like manner. So have you 
a Spirit most wonderfully volatile, 
and most fragrant and odoriferous, 
which kept in a Glass very close stopt 
for use; being taken pro Circulato 
majori Paracelsi. 
 
II. This is the highest Volatile 
acid in the whole Republick of 
Medicine, penetrating in a very 
short space the whole human Body 
from Head to Foot, and therefore 
is profitable in almost infinite 
Diseases, being a powerful attenuator 
and incider. 
 
III. It is a most admirable Diuretick, 
inferiour to no other 
Medicament, for it powerfully 
provokes Urine, and opens all 
Obstructions in the Reins, Ureters 
and Bladder; and expels 
from all those parts Stones, Sand 
or Gravel, Slime and other Tartarous 
Matter. And I am perswaded 
from the experience I 
have had thereof, That it transcends 
all other Medicines in 
breaking of the Stone; and that 
if such a thing be possible to be 
done by any Medicine, it may 
be done by this. 
 
IV. It is a great Alexipharmick, 
and resists putrefaction in 
the highest degree, it cures the 
Plague and all manner of putrid, 
malign and pestilential Feavers, 
driving the Poyson and malignity 
of the Disease from the Heart, 
and expelling it through the 
Pores of the Skin by Sweat. 
 
V. It is a most admirable Febrifuge, 
extinguishes the preternatural 
heat of all burning 
Feavers, takes away all their evil 
Symptoms, and famously quenches 
[^p.23^] 
Thirst; and therefore is 
profitable in all great Inflammations 
in any part of the Body, 
but chiefly of the Lungs. 
 
VI. As the Medicine is highly 
acute, so it as mightily conduces 
to the cure of many chronick 
Diseases, as the Scurvy, Cachexy, 
Dropsie, Jaundice, Quartans, 
hypochondriack Melancholy, 
Herpes, Scabs, Itch, Leprosie, 
and other malign eruptions of 
the Skin; prevailing also against 
several inveterate Diseases 
of the Head and Brain. 
 
VI. It opens Obstructions in 
all parts of the Body, almost to 
a Miracle; so that setting aside 
the Tincture of Steel, there is 
not a greater deobstructer in the 
World. It is good in Peripneumonia's, 
and most other Diseases 
of the Breast and Lungs, as 
Coughs, Colds, Asthma's, shortness 
of Breath, Wheazing, difficulty 
of Breathing and such 
like 
 
VIII. It is a great Antipleuretick, 
and by the relation of 
some Physicians which have used 
it in that case, a most famous 
Medicine against that Disease. 
It is resolutive, discussive, sudorifick, 
Alexipharmick and Anodyne; 
takes away the unnatural 
Fermentation of Humors, and 
is a great specifick in the Colick, 
being given in a little Cinamon-Water, 
or fair Water, and also 
mixed with a little Oyl of Nutmegs 
and Civet, and anointed 
on the Navil. 
 
IX. It is good in Gargarisms 
and Lotions, to stop Gangreens, 
take away rotten Flesh, Corns, 
Warts, as also to heal Cankers, 
Sores and Ulcers in the Mouth 
and other parts. It is preferable 
before A. F. for making Fucuses 
for the Face, being clear and delicate, 
whereas those made with 
A. F. rather blacken than whiten 
it. 
 
X. The Dose, and way of using 
it. You may give it from ten to 
twenty drops, two scruples or a 
drachm, according to the occasion 
and necessity: it may be taken 
in Beer, Ale, Mead, Wine, 
Water or Syrup. If it be given 
all day long in all that the sick 
drinks, you may give it from 
ten drops to twenty, or twenty 
five, as need requires. Otherwise 
give it Morning, Noon and 
Night, from half a drachm to a 
drachm, in the vehicles aforesaid. 
Price two Shillings six pence an 
Ounce. 
 
[}CHAP. XIII. 
 
Spiritus Anodynus noster. Our 
Spirit easing Pain.}] 
 
I. TAke powers of Amber, or of 
Limons, or of Aniseeds, a 
gallon: Thebian Opium eight ounces: 
choice Camphir six ounces: 
dissolve the Opium and extract the 
Tincture thereof with the powers 
first, which being very clear settled, 
decant off into another Glass, and 
if you please filter it: in this clear 
Tincture dissolve the Camphir, by 
degrees, by grinding it in a pure clean 
glass Mortar, then mix all together, 
and keep it for use. 
 
II. This Medicine receives its 
name from the admirable faculty 
[^p.24^] 
which it has of easing Pain, in 
any part of the Body: and this 
it performs as well by outward 
application, as by inwardly taking 
of it, or upon occasion by 
both these ways together. 
 
III. It gives immediate ease 
in all intolerable pains of the 
Head, as the Headach, whether 
new or old, Megrim and pains 
in the Teeth and Ears; as also 
pains in the Nose, and roof of the 
Mouth, although proceeding 
from the French Pox: and this 
it does by barely bathing the places 
affected, therewith twice a 
day, and applying a cloth thereon, 
dipped in the same. 
 
IV. It eases pains in the Neck, 
Convulsions, Cramp, and such 
like, though never so vehement, 
in any part of the Body, as also 
stitches and pains in the Stomach 
and Sides, the Pleurisie and bastard 
Pleurisie, pains in Womens 
Breasts coming from Cold, or 
Milk curdled, or from Blows, 
&c. by bathing the said afflicted 
parts therewith two or three 
times a day as aforesaid. 
 
V. It gives ease in all intolerable 
pains in the Shoulders, Arms, 
Hands, Fingers, or joynts of 
those parts, proceeding from 
cold and moisture, or from Blows 
or Strains, or the Gout, or French 
Pox, or any tartarous matter 
lodged in the part. 
 
VI. It is of singular use in 
Gangreens, to bath withal, twice 
a day at least: for if the Mortification 
be not compleat, it presently 
retrieves it, calling back 
again the baffled Spirits; and 
secures the part against any future 
assaults of the Disease. 
 
VII. In all manner of vehement 
pains of the Bowels and Belly, 
Convulsions of the Mesentery, 
the Colick, griping of the 
Guts, Wind, &c. as also in all 
manner of Afterpains in Women 
in Childbed, there is no greater, 
speedier nor more admirable a 
Remedy; for in these causes it 
gives relief almost in a moment; 
by well bathing the part, and applying 
over the parts a Flannel 
well warmed and moistned in 
the same, with repetition of the 
bathing at least two or three 
times a day, according as you 
see need require. 
 
VIII. In all manner of pains 
of the Hips, Thighs, Knees, 
Leggs, Shinbones, Ankles, Feet 
and Toes, coming from extream 
weakness, bruises, falls, blows, 
strains, colds, defluxions of humours, 
tumors or any tartarous 
matter or gelly in the Joynts, or 
proceeding from the French Pox, 
the Scurvy, a Rheumatism, 
Cramp or Gout, &c. there is 
no more present Remedy, than 
by bathing the said parts, two, 
three, or more times a day, with 
this our Anodyne Spirit. 
 
IX. It is an admirable thing 
in all weaknesses of the Joynts, 
the Rickets in Children, and vehement 
pains in the back, whether 
of Men or Women; as also 
for the Stone, Sand, Gravel or 
Slime, and vehement pain in the 
Yard in making of Water, by 
bathing therewith, and injecting 
it into the Yard with a Syringe, 
being first mixed with a fit proportion 
of Water. 
 
X. The Dose and manner of taking 
it inwardly. In all the aforesaid 
[^p.25^] 
Diseases it will be of mighty 
consequence to take it inwardly, 
for being so taken also, it performs 
the work to a miracle. The 
Dose is exactly the same with the 
Guttæ Vitæ in the ninth Chapter, 
to which I refer you: And 
you may take it also after the 
same manner, at the same times, 
and in the same vehicles, chiefly 
at Night going to Bed. Price 
twelve pence an Ounce.
