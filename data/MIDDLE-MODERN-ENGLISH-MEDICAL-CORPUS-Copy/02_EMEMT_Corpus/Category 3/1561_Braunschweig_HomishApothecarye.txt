[^f.2r^] 
[}The first chapter is concerning the head 
and his partes.}] 
 
[}For fallinge of the heyre of the head.}] 
 
MAke lye of the ashes burnt of doues dounge/ and washe the heade 
[/1./] 
therewyth. But if ye can not get doues dounge/ take leaues of oken 
tre/ and seth the middelmost rippes of them in water/ & wash 
the head oft there w=t=/ letting it dry by it selfe/ y=t= helpeth very well. 
 
Or els take the ashes burnt of litle frogges/ make a lye therwyth/ wash 
the head oft therewyth/ that hindreth the falling of the heyre. 
 
But for y=e= drye skaldes of it called in Latin Furfur Porrigo or Pityra 
[/2./] 
seth the rotes of Malowes in water/ & wash y=e= head oft therwith/ and they 
shall fall of. He y=t= hath a scalfering head/ let thesame take y=e= course bra~me 
[/3./] 
or wheat/ & cast sething hote water vpon the~/ let the~ stand one day & night: 
after y=t= let it be strayned through a cloth/ & put a litle vinegre thereto/ & strake 
it vpon the head/ & moyste~ it oft therw=t=/ y=t= doth driue the scelfering away. 
 
If one hath a head that can not be healed let him take thick creme and 
[/4./] 
anoynte the head therewith well in the euening and morning thre wekes 
continually/ but let the head be first wel and bare shauen/ y=t= the creme maye 
the better pearse in/ washe the head euery thyrde daye wyth strong warme 
lye/ that the head may be chased therwyth: at the last rensch the head with 
colde lye/ thesame draweth the heate out of it/ after that let it drye/ & anoint 
it agayn as before. Of thys wyse mayest thou heale & clense a head/ though 
it were harde crusted with corruption. 
 
But if any hath had vnclene scurfes or scabbes vpon the head/ & is healed 
of the~/ howbeit it pilleth as though it wold break vp agayn/ let him strake 
or anoynt it with oyle of flaxe sede or lyne sede/ let him frot the heade fore 
therewyth: thesame maketh the skin stronge/ harde and also cleane/ that it 
breake vp no more. 
 
[}For lyse and nittes.}] 
 
TAke the heades of herbe Gitt or Nigella/ and burne them to ashes/ put 
[/5./] 
swynes grese thereto/ and strake or kemme the heyres therewyth/ that 
dryueth awaye lyse and nittes. 
 
Or els bye quicksiluer for a penny/ and slake it with fastinge spatle/ put 
thereto half an vnce of swines grese or butter/ anoynte therewyth a kamb/ 
and kembe thy head therewyth/ thesame driueth awaye and killeth all the 
nittes. But if it is in summer or haruest/ that thou mayest haue the rootes 
of wilde saffron/ take the iuyce of them: wher the same is straked/ ther slayeth 
and driueth it away the liste/ and also lise of the priuy membres. 
 
Or els take a litle pece of the clothe that goldsmythes washe the gylted 
vessels wyth/ and strake the place therewyth where they are/ and they do 
fall of: and thys cloth mayest thou vse to twenty men/ and it maye be kepte 
yearly and dayly/ and remayneth good to vse/ specially for ouerbrowes and 
[^f.2v^] 
eye liddes/ wherein the same vermin called the lise of priuye membres do 
[/6./] 
growe/ and maye be vsed without daunger. 
 
For the lise of the head/ take a penny worth of lorel or baye berries/ bray 
the~ to pouder/ tye the~ in a linnen cloth/ seth thesame in running water/ and 
wash the head there with. Thesame vertue hath also the roote of Bearfote 
beaten to pouder. 
 
[}Of payne in the head.}] 
 
THe payn of the head co~meth somtime of his oune disease/ somtime of other 
[/7./] 
me~bres/ as of the stomake: somtime of outward accidentes/ as of 
beating/ falling or sunheat: somtime of wounding/ somtime of colde: so~tyme 
of heat/ somtime of superfluitie of blood/ somtime ca~ it not be sayde by what 
occasion/ somtime co~meth y=e= sicknes or diseas by it selfe/ & the same lasteth co~tinually. 
But most chefely cometh it by y=e= vpbraything of y=e= stomak into the 
head: to heal this/ is necessary to know of what complexion the disease is/ y=t= 
thou mayst purge & cle~se it therafter. If thou wilt than help him/ take hede 
of what complexion y=e= disease is. If it cometh of y=e= blood/ the same is hote & 
[/8./] 
moyst/ y=t= shalt thou know therby/ if the payne is most in y=e= forpart of y=e= head/ 
& then are those veynes read y=t= are by the eyes/ the face rede and hote/ y=e= veynes 
vnder the eyes are pale/ the veynes of the te~ples beate fearcely/ y=e= veyne 
of the puls beateth fast and sore/ and is great/ his vrine is reade and thicke/ 
hys bodye louse. These are the euident tokens of the blood. 
 
[/9./] 
If the headake cometh of Colera/ that is/ of hote and drye complexion/ y=t= 
shalt thou know therby: The nose is hote and aketh for heate/ the tounge is 
great and drye/ he is thyrsty/ and can slepe but litle: and when he slepeth/ he 
fighteth & is vnquiet/ the veyne of his pulse is litle and feble/ & feleth y=e= grefe 
most in the right side. The same nedeth not to blow his nose/ for nothing issueth 
out of it/ by reason of the great heate. 
 
[/10./] 
If the headake commeth of flegma/ that is/ of colde and moyst complexion 
or nature/ the same hath greater grefe in the hindermost part of y=e= head 
then the for part/ and can slepe better: he is heuy in all his members/ he is litle 
thyrsty/ the veynes of his pulse are greate and feble. 
 
[/11./] 
But if y=e= headake cometh of Mela~coly/ the~ hath he y=e= most grefe in y=e= left 
syde of the head. Galen sayth: the head is diuided into foure partes: In 
the fore parte hath blood the dominion/ Colera in the right syde/ Mela~coly 
in the left syde/ & flegma beareth rule in the hindermost part. 
 
If the headake cometh of blood/ then let him blood in y=e= head veyne called 
[/12./] 
Cephalica/ in y=e= hand by the thumbe/ or els in the forhead. Take hede also 
lest his age of youth (wherby he might be to feble) hinder the: or els y=e= tyme: 
the same must be kept wyth dietynge/ as I shall teache hereafter. 
 
If the headake cometh of Colera/ thesame must be let blood at the lyuer 
[/13./] 
veyne/ and geue him to eate prunes of Damaske/ and foure cheries though 
they be dryed/ take oyle of roses or violettes/ put thereto as much vinegre/ 
anoynte his head therwyth wher it greueth or aketh/ dip two he~pe~ clothes 
therin/ & let him hold the~ in his hand/ y=e= same draweth out y=e= euil heat: but if 
ye can not haue the oyle of roses/ take the whyte of egges/ rose water and 
[^f.3r^] 
vinegre/ and do thus: Set his fete in hote water/ and rub his legges well 
dounwarde: and if he will not haue the~ washed/ then let him dyppe the fete 
in colde water/ and lay him doune to rest/ and not slepe by day time/ but beware 
for heate and wyne. Howbeit if he will drincke wyne/ let it be soure/ 
and wel mixt/ let him also drinke water sodden wyth barlye/ thesame doth 
coole him/ & let him take otherwhyles sugar candy into his mouth/ to slake 
the thyrst/ or els agayne co~fect of cheries or prunes. But he must beware of 
salt meates and flesh/ without it were of chycken/ or els let him eat soure vnrype 
grapes/ or els the iuyce of them/ or sorel. Let him vse a litle vinegre in 
his meat/ but no spice nor ought y=t= chafeth: & take hede he be lose in y=e= bellye. 
If nede constrayne the/ take Venice sope or alume/ make pilles of it/ & vse it 
for a suppository. But if ye haue y=e= rootes of betes/ strake the~ a litle w=t= salte/ & 
[/14./] 
put them vp into the fundament/ or els seth hony till it be black in an earthe~ 
vessel/ put a litle salt thereto/ & make pilles of it/ and vse them likewise. If ye 
haue not hony/ take the iolke of an egge/ & as muche salt/ seth thesame together/ 
and make pillets thereof/ the bignesse of a haselnut or filberte/ and put 
that into the bodye/ thesame retayneth the sege. If it is a man/ let him beware 
of women/ for they are hurtfull for him/ also of mostarde/ garleke/ onyons/ 
lekes and suche lyke. If the headake co~meth of superfluity of blood/ 
[/15./] 
then make him thus to bleth at the nose without smarte: Take sedes of red 
nettels/ and braye them to pouder in a morter/ blow a littel of the same pouder 
[/16./] 
into his nose with a quill. But if ye can not get sedes of nettels/ put a 
hole of the herbe called Millefoyl or Yarbe into the nose/ and rubbe y=e= nose 
outwardly softly/ and then shal it bleth. But if it be in winter/ and canst get 
nether Chyrurgeon to let blood/ nor nettels/ nor nettels sede/ nor yet no millefoyle/ 
and wouldest gladly drawe the blood from the head/ then take two 
sack bandes/ and binde or tye them first about the legges aboue the knye/ & 
let it fo abyde the space of halfe a Pater noster: then lose it agayne/ and tye 
it agayne. Do this the space of a quarter of an houre: than tye his armes aboue 
the elbowe lykewyse/ thus shalt thou drawe al the blood from y=e= head. 
But ye must handle thys thing warelye/ leste ye let the numbre to longe to 
be tyed/ whereby the membre might be asconnyed or choked. 
 
But if the heade burne to sore/ take the iuyce of Porceleyne/ and strake 
[/17./] 
the head and tempels therewyth/ or where the most heate is. 
 
If the heade doth ake so sore/ (by reason of a morre or runninge) that he 
[/18./] 
can not snoffe hys nose/ than were it good to vse confectes made of the apothecaries/ 
called Nasalia/ and put them thereinto/ or els Margerim wrechen 
together/ and put into the nose/ for the same draweth out all euell humors. 
If ye can not haue the same nother/ the~ take a grene rote of betes/ as 
longe as a finger and a halfe/ sharped a litle and brused/ put thesame into 
the nose/ and let it abide the space of a quarter of an hour/ thesame draweth 
out also all euell humors. 
 
But if ye can not haue thesame nother/ than take the sede of Cokle/ that 
is founde in the corne/ beate it to pouder/ put the same into the noyse/ that 
draweth sore. Or els take a pot/ and put rapes into it/ and seth them/ than 
holde thy nose ouer it/ that the vapor or hote breth ascende so into thy head/ 
that thou do euen sweat with it. 
 
[^f.3v^] 
Or take water cresses dryed/ not in the sunne/ but in the ayer/ braye the 
same to pouder in a morter/ or within your handes/ syft it through a lynnen 
cloth. Howbeit if it would be to long to drye it in the ayer/ then drye it in an 
ouen/ when the bread is drawen/ or els in a stoue or hote house. 
 
[/19./] 
But if one hath payne in the head of Melancoly/ his disease is come by 
colde/ and of drye complexion. Dicte thesame and gyue him to eat meates y=t= 
are hote and moyst/ to chafe hys nature and moyst hys body. If he haue no 
sieges/ then geue him the fourth part of an vnce or iij. drames of Diacarthami/ 
before daye breake/ and let him walke vp and doune/ vntill he get a siege. 
But when the siege is done/ then gyue hym some thynge to comfort him 
or that may restore hys strength/ as suppinge or broth of chekins/ or yonge 
beafe/ and mixe somtime a litle beaten saffron in hys meate. After that may 
ye geue him a fewe pigges fete/ for the same make hys veynes tender and 
moyst/ & geue him somtyme in the morning or daye tyme milke to drincke/ y=t= 
is sodden with egges: that strengtheneth hym/ and geueth nature force. Also 
oughte he to bath somtime a litle in a bath made with Fenel or Heysede/ 
gathered vpon a heye loft/ & otes straw: but ye may not bath to long nor to 
hote. If in bathing the sweat will not in short space issue/ the~ go out: for the~ 
is not the bath good for thy/ & kepe thy selfe warm after it/ lest thou do take 
colde vpon it/ & beware of all meates that may coole & dry the/ as mustard/ 
garleke/ onyons/ lekes/ also of harde or olde chese/ Martinmasse beafe/ Haringe/ 
read haringe/ Lynge and suche lyke. 
 
But if the headake commeth of flegma/ namely of cold and superfluous 
[/20./] 
moysture/ then is it necessary to purge the heade wyth pilles Cochie/ and 
pilles De iera. Beware of suche thinges as coole/ and bringe corrupte moisture/ 
as fruyte/ water/ fleshe/ fresh chese/ new bread/ and all that is of euel digestion. 
His temples ought to be anoynted wyth oyl of Camomille. But if 
thou hast not oyle of Camomill/ then take two egges shelles full of floures 
of Camomil/ grene or seere/ and seth them in wine and water together/ and 
when it is sodden to the halfe/ then strayne it through a cloth/ and put ther-to 
butter/ so much as a gouse egge/ and then boyle the water and wyne awaye: 
Bath his fete also in a depe tob/ euen vntill the knees/ that the hote 
breth maye thorow warme his body/ & he may sweat. Into this water put 
two handfulles of floures of Camomille/ and a handful of heysede well sodden. 
If he do sweat well/ laye hym to slepe/ & couer him warme: if he coulde 
sweat in the bed/ that should do hym good/ then gyue hym a litle grene ginger/ 
and a litle coriander stiped a night longe in vinegre and dryed agayne/ 
thesame doth chafe his head and stomack/ and consumeth the euel humors/ 
that rise out of the stomack into the head/ and trouble the braynes/ that same 
doth it swage. Geue him also in the morninge fastinge/ if he can bear it/ 
and let him fast two houres there vpon: Take thre quarters of an vnce of 
aqua vite/ a peny weyght of beaten saffron/ and a peny weyghte of beaten 
Cinamon/ half an vnce of Buglossen or Oxetunge water/ mixe these together/ 
let them stand a day and night/ then shall it be tempered the one with/ 
the other. Thys doth warme hys stomack/ riseth into hys head/ dryeth hys 
moyst braynes/ wherof his disease commeth in the heade. Let him eat meates 
of good digestion/ and not to muche at ones: for so longe the stomack is 
[/21./] 
[^f.4r^] 
colde and moyst can it not digest wel/ and if he eate much/ therof waxeth it 
full of slyme and filth/ and many diseases growe of it/ as payne in the head/ 
greuous couginges/ agues/ gripinges in the belly/ wormes/ payne in y=e= mother 
or matrice/ and many other: and if the payne lieth in the heade/ then let 
him be bathed/ specially wyth these herbes: Take of Valeriane and Fenell 
of eche a hand full/ Ootes straw two handfull/ a peck of Ootes/ but if thou 
hast no Ootes/ take the straw only/ Heysede/ of euerye one iij. handfull/ put 
thesame into a litle sack/ and seth it in a kettel wyth water/ bath therwith/ 
and when he is thorow warm and sweateth/ then rensch hym wyth louke 
or bloode warm water/ and cast a cloth or twayne ouer hym for coolinge/ 
laye hym doune/ couer hys body and head warme/ that he may also sweate 
in the bed: afterwarde take some of the coueringe awaye/ let him slepe a litle 
in the bedde/ and after that geue him a good broth of a pollet or chycken/ 
or els a supping of yong beafe or veele that is not ouerfat/ or els the broth of 
graye peasen/ with beaten saffron the bignes of a pease: but he maye nether 
eat nor drink to much/ & then rest a litle. If he can/ let him sweat a litle after 
it/ & be alway still/ both in the bath and also bed/ as he is in the heat or sweating/ 
lest he become to fel. The head washen wyth lye/ wherin are sodden y=e= 
floures of Camomil/ taketh away the euill humors of the head and braines 
y=t= are gathered ther in with cold: thesame doth also the water where in floures 
of Camomil are sodde~/ & put vpon the head. But if y=e= head did thus ake/ 
[/22./] 
by reason of a constipacion or stopping/ so y=t= ye could not wel take breth/ the~ 
bye halfe an vnce of Cinomon vnbeaten/ and eate oft a litle thereof/ or els 
take a pece of bread/ stipe it in wine/ and strowe Cinamon beaten vpon it/ 
eate the same/ that taketh awaye the stoppinge/ minisheth the slyme/ of the 
whych the stoppinge is engendred. 
 
This medicin doth also minish greatly/ and taketh awaye the payne in 
the head: Take a pint of wine/ warme thesame/ then take four yolkes of egges/ 
beate thesame in the wine/ and moysten hys head well therewith: the 
same draweth out the heat/ and alayeth the payne. 
 
But if the head ake were come of cold ayer or windes/ the~ wash y=e= head 
[/23./] 
with water/ wherin are sodden y=e= floures & herle of Camomil/ after y=t= strake 
y=e= forhead/ te~ples & stomak wyth y=e= foresayd oyle or butter/ or els stipe soft clothes 
therin/ & lay the~ into the neck/ the same draweth out the euil moystnes 
& cold/ & warmeth y=e= head. Water distilled of Betony/ & a cloth dipped there 
in/ & pressed wel out agayne/ and then wrapped or tyed hard about y=e= head/ 
restoreth the head that was distempered wyth cold moysture (euen y=t= some 
fall into frensy) ryght well to his former estate. But if thou canst not get the 
water/ but canst haue the herbe/ then seth the same in wyne/ mixt wyth the 
third deal water/ and vse the same in stede of the distilled water. 
 
[}A wounderfull experience for the headacke.}] 
 
SEt a dish or platter of tynne vpon the bare head filled with water/ putte 
an vnce and an halfe/ or two vnces of molten leade therein/ whyle he 
hath it vpon the head. Or els make a garlande of Veruayne/ and wear it 
daye and night/ that helpeth wounderfully. 
 
[^f.4v^] 
Lykewyse mayest thou take two hand full of Veruayn/ thesame mayst 
thou chappe small/ & seth them in a quart of wine/ put the~ into a littel sack/ & 
laye them hote vpon the heade/ twise or iij. tymes/ that healeth well. 
 
[}A slouggish or slepery disease.}] 
 
THys disease commeth gladly and lightely of colde & much moystnesse/ 
[/24./] 
specially to a good folke/ because their naturall heate is gone. This disease 
is thus knowen: they haue alway great heat/ whereof the cause is an 
impostumacion/ y=t= lieth in the head behinde/ and his vrine is pale and thick. 
By reason of y=e= disease & y=e= trublinge of his head & braynes/ he lieth or sitteth/ 
makinge semblance as though he dyd slepe/ and yet doth not: he wendeth & 
waltereth/ & happely his head & fete do mete together: thesame must be healed 
of thys wise: Bye a litle nysing pouder/ or els take the sede of y=e= Nigella 
that is founde in the corne feldes/ beate and vse them in stede of the nysinge 
pouder/ or els vse the floures of mustarde sede/ or take beaten Mergerim 
gentle/ put any of these into hys noyse oft tymes/ and cause him oft to nyse. 
Rubbe also the soles of his fete oft wyth warme water/ vinegre & salt/ with 
a wollen cloth/ the palme of his handes also/ and kepe his belly louse wyth 
suppositories of alum/ or other/ as I haue taught before/ and let him be layd 
in a place where much light is: let also much communication be had wyth 
hym/ to hinder him of his slepe/ and kepe him from slepinge. But if he hath 
great heate/ then maye he be bathed in a bath/ that the vncleane heat and 
moystnesse maye auoyde from him/ and anoynte hys heade wyth water/ 
wherein are sodden Camomille/ Anis and Wormwood. Roses drye or grene 
were good also/ of eche a few/ that the water be not to stronge: for the 
washynge and bathynge doth muche good to the heade/ by reason it doth 
comfort the same. 
 
To the patient may be gyuen Diapenidion/ Diagalanga or Pliris cum 
musco/ made in the Apothecarye. 
 
But if the vrine is rede/ and the pulse beateth sore/ then commeth the disease 
by heate: let him then vse colde medicines/ as confect of roses or violettes. 
Also were it good ofte to burne the heyre of a man before hys nose/ and 
he so to receyue the sent thereof. 
 
Galen sayth: He that hath payne in the hindermost part of his head/ the 
same must be let bloode vnder the chynne/ speciallye on the ryght syde. 
 
[}A medecin awaking a man sore, and withstandeth slepe greatly.}] 
 
Seth or boyle Rew or Herbe grace and vinegre of lyke quantite in a couered 
[/25./] 
vessel/ and when it is sodden/ put a litle more vinegre to it/ and put y=e= 
Rew into a litle cloth/ & put it then agayn into the vessel wher y=e= vinegre is: 
& when thou wilt awake hym/ then take the cloth/ holde it to his nose/ and 
browes/ & to his temples/ thesame awaketh hym continentlye/ & causeth to 
slepe nomore. Stronge vinegre holden to his nose/ so that he holdeth in hys 
breth/ doth lykewyse: for he awaketh/ and specially a fether dipped in stro~g 
vinegre/ and thrust into the nose so far that he be constrayned to nyse. 
 
Penyreal dipped in vinegre/ and holden to the nose/ doth likewyse. 
 
[^f.5r^] 
Two thinges hinder a man of his slepe/ the one is natural/ the other vnnatural. 
[/26./] 
The vnnatural hindrance of slepe weryeth a man/ and coleth him 
inwardely. 
 
But he that hath payne in the heade by reason of exhalation or vpbraythinge 
oute of the stomak into the head/ let the same eate ripe quinces after 
breakfast/ that are well rosted/ thesame refrayne the vpbraythinge into the 
head/ and driue dounward to the siege. 
 
But if the vpbraythinge come by reason of a colde stomacke/ then were 
it good to eate Coriander sede/ after breakfast/ the whych is stiped in vinegre 
a daye and a night/ and dryed agayne/ thys withstandeth the vpbraytynge 
of the stomack. 
 
Or els gyue him to drinke the iuyce of Wormewoode/ so muche as conteyne 
an egges shell/ with as much wyne: this same is good for the euil euaporacion 
or risinge vp into the head. 
 
They whyche are inclined to this disease of the heade/ oughte to be litle 
sturringe/ and beware of meates that be of euell/ digestion as Martimasse 
beefe/ salt fishes/ or moulberries: for they cause euel euaporacions to rise into 
the head. 
 
Him also that hath headake/ and woteth not whereof it is/ mayest thou 
[/27./] 
heale of thys wyse: Take a penyworth of pepper/ & as much beate~ mustard 
sede that is not steped/ mixe these two together/ let him take there of in hys 
mouth so great as a small beane/ and remoue it wyth his tonge hyther and 
thyther/ let him kepe it thus in hys mouth a whyle/ and it shall drawe the 
euell humors out of the head into the mouth. Thys must be done fastinge/ 
and thre houres in the daye. 
 
[}Headake of muche nisinge.}] 
 
IF a man doth nyse much/ that cometh by reason of colde in the head/ him 
[/28./] 
mayest thou heale of this wise: Purge the head with pillule auree/ or pillule 
de hiera picra/ after that let him eat nutmegges/ Coria~der and Clares/ 
and let him oft smell at Castoreum/ or els put a drop of Oleum benedictum 
into his nose and eares in the morning/ that chafeth/ & let him eate oetmeel 
gruell/ and drinke wyne or stale bier or ale/ nother let him eat meates that 
be moyst of complexion/ but drye. 
 
[}Of apostemation in the head and braynes.}] 
 
THe braynes are greued many waies/ somtime of y=e= stomak/ whe~ a man 
[/29./] 
eateth meates/ that the stomake can not digest/ and lye sliminge & rotting 
in the stomack/ yelding an vpbraythinge into the head/ wherof y=e= head 
hath euer payne/ and thereof are the braynes diseased. 
 
Somtime engendreth an apostemacio~ in the braynes of some litle skinnes/ 
that enuiron the braynes/ thesame are called Phrenesis. He that hath y=e= 
[/30./] 
same apostemation/ can not slepe/ and becommeth somtyme mad. Thesame 
apostemation commeth somtyme of Colera/ when y=e= same is inflamed/ and 
breateth vp into the heade. It commeth also of hote bloode/ that lyeth in 
[^f.5v^] 
the harte/ and bratheth vp into the braynes: he that hath thesame apostemacion/ 
hath also great drought in the mouth/ and the tounge waxeth black/ & 
he beco~meth read vnder y=e= eyes/ & specially about y=e= nose/ & such apostemacio~ 
haue they most/ y=t= are of hote & drye complexion/ whe~ they labour or trauail 
to much. He y=t= hath this disease/ y=e= first iij. dayes when it ouertaketh him/ 
must he let blood in y=e= Cephalica/ that is the veyne of the head/ and the same 
daye ought he to let blood in y=e= forehead/ or els ser horselcaches or blood suckers 
thereto. But if the horselcaches will not sucke/ then anoynte the temples 
wyth wyne/ then do they sit to by and by. 
 
Good hede ought to be take~ to them and wel kept/ geue the~ none other 
meat/ the~ bread steped in almondes milke. Geue the~ almond milke to drink 
& beware of meates of hote complexion/ let the~ be still & quiet/ & beware of 
vexynge and anger/ or els becomme they lightly franticke and madde. 
 
Al men y=t= haue feble braynes ought to beware of beanes/ for they trouble 
[/31./] 
the braynes/ and cause heuy dreames/ the braynes and head sycke. The 
lentilles do lykewyse/ for they cause euell bloode/ and stop the bowels & veynes/ 
that they can not sweate/ & that in such men as labour not/ tender and 
sycke feble/ they hurte the breste/ the lightes/ the eyes/ the skinne aboute the 
braynes/ and all the veynes of the body: Contrary to this are speces/ which 
comforte and fortifye the bodye/ head and brayes. 
 
[}Of whirling in the heade.}] 
 
[/32./] 
MAny are whom the heade whyrleth so sore/ y=t= he thinketh the earth 
turneth vpsyde doune/ y=e= same also hath payne in y=e= eye~/ he thinketh 
y=t= a sorte of flyes do flye before his eyen: those may be healed of this 
wyse: They maye drinke no stronge drinkes nor wine/ without it be wel alayed 
wyth water/ & to the~ ought to be geue~ pilles made of half an vnce of 
Aloe/ & a peny weyght of Mastix/ geue him of them euery night fyue/ y=e= bignes 
of smal beanes/ and geue him after y=t= Diamargariton or Dianthos/ or 
els Diapliris/ for thesame comforte the head and stomack/ and anoynte his 
head wyth oyle of Camomille. 
 
Or els take Betony/ whose leaues must be dryed in the shadowe/ and 
made to pouder/ thesame strowe or strake vpon a pece of bread/ beyng stiped 
in wyne/ and eate thesame in the morninge and at euen/ thesame restoreth 
the braynes. Or els take Cerfoil or Cheruill sodden in water/ and lay 
it to the temples and forehead/ thesame warmeth the braynes and heade/ & 
take Pennyreal made to pouder/ and drinke it wyth water of Pennyreal. 
Comin refraineth the whyrling/ comforteth the braynes/ and maketh them 
to growe agayne or encrease. 
 
[}Another for the whyrlinge.}] 
 
COmmen stiped in vinegre thre dayes longe/ and after dried agayn/ & 
at night when one will go to bed/ kept hole in the mouth/ & chawed 
as longe as a man can/ at the last swalowed doune/ etc. Some eat it made 
to pouder/ but it is not so good. 
 
If it were a sicknes feruent/ by reason of an exceding colde or whyrling/ 
[^f.6r^] 
then take the braynes of a hogge/ rost the same vpon a grede yron/ and cut 
slices therof/ & strowe a pouder there vpon made of Cummin/ Peonye sede 
& Penny real in like qua~tite: this is very good/ put therto so much miscelde~ 
of an oke/ as any of y=e= other spices made to pouder also/ & geue it to y=e= patie~t/ 
let him vse this iij. or iiij. tymes after another/ & he shall be healed. For it driueth 
out all superfluous humours of the braines/ and drieth & sharpeneth it. 
 
[}VVhen a man can not slepe.}] 
 
OFt tymes commeth that a man can not slepe by reason of the heat of 
[/33./] 
y=e= braynes mouing/ somtyme by reason of the read colera/ whiche is 
hote and drye/ somtyme by reason of the black colera/ which is colde & drye/ 
when melancoly is risen into the head/ somtime commeth it by reason of exceding 
heate/ that is risen into the head of swete moystinesse. 
 
If the waking come of melancolia or sorowfulnesse/ then becommeth a 
[/34./] 
man strayght about the cheste or stomake/ & his heat is dry: y=e= colour also of 
his skin is altered. But if y=e= waking come of y=e rede colera/ then waxeth hys 
[/35./] 
skin rede colored also/ then gyue him barly water to drinke. But if the waking 
come of the black colera/ then becommeth the skin of the patient pale/ 
and he hath muche carefulnesse/ anguish and pensifnesse. But if it commeth 
of phlegma/ then becommeth the patient heuy and slouggish. 
 
It is to be considered/ that if a man watche much/ it maketh him heauy 
[/36./] 
of courage/ and that commeth by reason hys membres drye/ wherein lieth 
the power of the bodye/ and it hindreth also the digestion of the stomacke/ 
whereof are engendred euill moystures in the bodye. 
 
If the weaking is caused by colera/ then washe hys head wyth water/ 
[/37./] 
wherein are sodden leaues of violettes/ or els Lettis/ or the sede of it/ & strake 
the heade wyth women milcke. 
 
Alume the bignes of a great bean kept in the mouth/ draweth the moistnesse 
out of the heade: after that washe the mouth with water/ and beware 
of all thynges that are hote of complexion. 
 
If the waking be caused by reason of heate/ take whyte or black poppy 
[/38./] 
sede/ braye thesame in a morter/ poure water therin/ and make a milke of it/ 
which geue him to drinke. Or els seth the toppes of black poppye in milke/ 
and let him drinke it. Take a dish of black poppy sede/ beate it well/ temper 
it wyth water blood warme/ that it waxe as a thick milke/ moysten there-in 
a fyne linnen cloth a hand broade/ and as longe that it maye go aboute 
hys heade: thesame doeth coole hys heade/ and if he awake aboute myd-nighte/ 
do it agayne. Howbeit ye must take hede/ that if he haue no sicges/ 
then geue hym to bedwarde halfe an vnce of syrope of Violettes/ wyth an 
vnce of warme water/ mixte together/ but let it be colde when ye wyll 
ministre hym thesame: geue hym also to drinke creame/ or potage of peasen 
sodden wythout anye salte or fatnesse/ onlye peasen/ and let hym drincke 
thesame blood warme in the mornynge/ lett hym after thys lye hygh wyth 
the head/ well couered/ and let him fast herevpon sixe houres. Neuerthelesse 
if he waxe faynte/ and hath had a siege/ then maye he eate and drinke a litle/ 
but be ware of excesse. 
 
[^f.6v^] 
The crounes vpon the poppy heades sodden in milke/ make of the same 
a pappe/ and thereof at night: the same maye be geuen a yonge childe/ and 
it causeth to slepe fast and restlye. Or els take Betony/ and laye it vpon hys 
heade. 
 
If one slepeth vnrestly/ let him eat lettice: but is it a chylde/ let the Lettice 
be well sodden in water/ and geue him the same to drinke. 
 
[}Of one that hath the palsye.}] 
 
THe palsey taketh men sundery wyse/ for somtime commeth the disease 
[/39./] 
by anger/ somtyme by colde/ somtyme by superfluous eatinge and drinkinge/ 
whereof is engendred in man ouermuche slyme/ whereby the veynes 
are stopped/ or els that the blood encreaseth excessiuely/ and ouercommeth 
the harte/ or els strayth in the membres/ of the which is caused the palseye. 
It taketh men also that be lecherous/ whose mary in the bones waysteth & 
cooleth/ so that vnwares all his force fayleth/ and he finally doth dye. 
 
Somtyme doth it take anye of the membres that haue ben maymed/ 
and not well healed/ whereof they waxe somtyme sere/ and can not suffre 
the heate of the harte/ whiche is cause of theyr death and destruction/ and 
the membre becommeth lame and wrye. 
 
This disease taketh somtyme the one membre/ as hand or fote/ somtyme 
[/40./] 
the halfe body/ or the tonge/ so that a man can not speake: somtyme co~meth 
it of ouermuche ioye/ heuinesse/ meate or drincke/ ouermuche laboure/ reste/ 
slouthfulnesse/ feare/ swonnynge/ hartequake/ and of superfluitye of bloode/ 
flegma/ colera or melancoly. 
 
Somtyme is the cause/ that the two strynges/ comminge doune from 
the brayne through the backbone into the fete: through the one goeth the naturall 
heate/ and through the other the colde/ that the same stringes ( I saye) 
are stopped/ ether the one or both. Wherfore/ in whatsoeuer membre is stopped 
thys stringe/ that the naturall spirit can not come into the same/ it wareth 
lame. Let euery Physicion or Chirurgeon therfore rule him after this/ 
and well and exactly knowe/ and serche the cause of the disease/ that he may 
the more certaynly knowe how to heale the patient. 
 
If moysture is cause of the disease/ then muste the same be minished by 
[/41./] 
suche thynges as consume it/ warme and comforte the bodye/ of thys wyse: 
Take Lauender/ Sage/ Cousloppe called herbe Paralisis/ Reu/ Iuniper 
berryes/ of eche a handfull/ a pint of Aqua vite/ a quarte of stronge whyte 
wine/ putt all these into a greate potte/ and set it into a kettel wyth water/ 
and let it seth well. Wyth thys wyne streke the lymmes greued twyse in the 
daye/ and let them drye agayne by them selues/ and drinke twyse in the day 
of this wyne/ at euery tyme so much as an egges shell conteyneth. 
 
But if the disease is comme by reason of superfluitye of blood/ then must 
[/42./] 
he be letten bloode incontinentlye. And if the disease is in the righte syde/ 
then let him bloode in the lefte syde: If it is in the lefte syde/ then lette him 
bloode in the ryght syde/ in the arme/ and geue hym halfe a dragme or triakle 
in a bath/ wyth warme wyne/ wherein Castoreum hath ben sodden. 
But if thou haste not Castoreum/ then take Lauender or Sage water/ 
[^f.7r^] 
drinke that/ the same helpeth. But if thou haste not the water also/ seeth the 
herbe ether of them in good wyne/ and drincke it. Or els take fyne Sage/ 
Lauender/ of eche thre handfull/ let them stepe in thre pintes of wyne xiiij. 
dayes/ after that styll and drinke it. If ye can not stylle it/ then seth the wine 
wyth the herbes/ and geue hym to drinke of it. 
 
[}If the palsey hath taken a man, and his membres were so holye 
taken, that he doth not feale when he is touched vpon 
the same, then let him be bathed drye 
of this wise.}] 
 
COuer a bathynge vessell well and close/ laye brickestones in the fyre/ 
[/43./] 
that they waxe glowynge hote. Take also Iuniper berries/ Mullen 
called Tapsus barbatus/ and reade Organ/ of eche foure hand full/ seth the 
same well in a kettel well couered/ or els in a pot/ and putte sixe quartes of 
good wyne thereto/ put hote water in the bathynge vessell/ that it be well 
warmed. And before thou entrest into the vessel/ take two tyles that be hoted/ 
put them into a tobbe/ and poure of thys foresayde wyne vpon them/ so 
that euen the very bathynge vessell be warmed wyth it: then set the patient 
in the vessell/ and take alwaye a stone out and into the tobbe/ and poure of 
the wyne vpon it/ vntill he do sweate. But ye must beware lest he do bath 
to hote/ that he faynt not/ or that he bath not to longe. Of thys bath are all 
hys membres chafed/ and that helpeth hym very well. Whe~ he goeth furth 
out of the bath/ then let him laye himselfe vpon a bedde: and if his stre~gth is 
so good/ that he can sweat in the bed/ that is very good for him. Let him also 
beware for takynge colde. And when he waxeth drye/ then let hys lamed 
lymmes be straked wyth water of Lauender. If ye haue not the water/ 
then take the wyne wherein Lauender hath ben sodden wyth Sage/ or 
els Sage alone/ do thys thre tymes in the daye. If he hath streingth sufficient/ 
then let him be bathed ix. dayes longe/ euerye daye ones. He ought also 
to be anoynted wyth halfe an vnce of Castoreum made to pouder/ with ij. 
vnces of oyle of oliue warmed/ let hys limmes be anoynted therewith threfe 
in the daye/ if he can suffre if. 
 
[}To restore agayne membres that be lamed 
or taken.}] 
 
TAke Sage and seth it in water/ put it into a longe pott: if the disease 
[/44./] 
is in the handes/ then putte alwaye one hande into the pott/ that the 
exhalacion come to it so hote as ye can suffre it/ tyll it do sweate. After that 
take halfe a pounde of Aqua vite/ and a hand full of Sage/ and as muche 
Rue/ cut them small/ and seth them in the Aqua vite/ in a pott wyth a narrowe 
mouth/ well stopped/ and so putte into sethynge water. 
 
If the Aqua vite is dronke in of the herbes/ than put more therin/ & seth 
it vntil it boyled/ then put a litle therof into a gobblet or other crewyse/ wel 
close/ and chafe it so warme as ye can suffre if: stype a softe or fyne cloth 
[^f.7v^] 
therein/ and strake the patientes lymmes therewyth be a fyre. After y=t= take 
oyle of Camomille/ and put thereto as much Aqua vite/ and strake thesame 
wyth a soft linnen cloth about the ioyntes of the paciente. The cloth oughte 
to be made of thys wyse/ that it be as longe/ that it maye couer the ioynte 
holy: then winde a black shepes skinne about the ioynture/ euery euen and 
morow/ xiiij. dayes continually. 
 
But if the Palsye hath taken a foote/ arme or knee/ then put the herbes 
out into a tob/ laye a pece of wood therevpon/ set the fete ther on/ and couer 
the tob close. And when it waxeth colde/ then chafe it agayne wyth a hote 
bricke/ and bath the membre/ as afore. But if the disease were in ether of the 
houkels or shoulders/ then must the foresayd herbes be putt into a litle sack 
or bagge/ beynge brode and longe halfe a yarde/ and then seth it/ and laye it 
hote vpon the taken membre: and when it waxeth colde/ then to laye another 
strayghte waye in the place/ and anoynte hym as before/ and kepe the 
membre that is taken allwaye warme. Lette hys meat and drincke be allwaye 
seasoned wyth beaten saffron/ according as he couled. Lette him also 
eate oft yonge hogges or porckes fete/ sodden wyth rapes: the same comfort 
the synewes. Or els let him vse in stede of saffron/ Cinamon/ or els the soueraygne 
Buglosse. 
 
[}For trembling or shakinge of the handes.}] 
 
Washe thy handes oute of a Lauor wyth colde water/ and let them dry 
[/45./] 
by them selues/ as oft as thou doest wash them: but it were better if ye layd 
Sage there in. 
 
If a man standeth in feare of the Palsye/ let the same eate euerye mornynge 
two or thre mustard sedes/ and two pepper cornes. The same is assured 
for the same disease that daye. 
 
[}Of dronkennesse.}] 
 
Dronkennesse commeth oft by superfluous and vndigested vapor/ braythynge 
[/46./] 
vp/ and troubling the braynes. Lykewise doth also the Son/ wyth 
ouerchafynge heade/ whereof the braynes waxe feble/ and mans heade aketh: 
which accident dronken folke doth ouertake also. Dronkennesse doth 
also weaken the wytte and body of man wyth the memorye so sore/ that he 
knoweth nomore what he doth/ then an vnreasonable beast. 
 
It chaunceth otherwhyles to some folke/ to be dronken/ and yet do not 
[/47./] 
drinke ouermuche: and that happeneth two maner of wayes: Fyrste that 
they haue so great payne/ or wept so much/ that thereby their braynes and 
head are become feble: and when they drinke/ the drinkinge doth so muche 
the soner strike into theyr braynes. Besydes thys are many men/ that by nature 
haue a feble head and braynes/ though they are no great drinkes/ and 
therfore doth the drinke runne sone into theyr heades. This also happeneth 
diuerse wayes: First/ because the drinkes are to stronge for them. Secondly/ 
because the wedder or place where they drinke/ are to hote for them/ or 
els the Sonne hath febled their braynes. Thyrdelye/ if they are in a whote 
[^f.8r^] 
place and much noyse/ whych they are not accostumed/ wyth that doth the 
drinke swetely ouercomme them/ etc. 
 
If the dronkennesse is of hote complexion/ then anoynte hys head with 
[/48./] 
oyle of roses/ or oyle of violettes/ or both mixte together/ anoynte (I saye) 
hys head and temples there wyth: after y=t= geue him to drinke water of Poppy/ 
beaten wyth water of roses/ and mixte together lyke milke. After that 
set his fete into a warme water/ rub them wyth salt/ wyth a wollen cloth/ & 
then anoynte them wyth oyle of violettes/ that the vapors maye synke doune 
out of the head. After the same cause him sieges with pilles of alume or 
sope/ or els wyth the yolke of an egge and salte. Let hys drinke be barly water/ 
or els syrop of violettes/ wyth as muche agayne blood warme water to 
drinke. All thys haue I chefelye shewed therefore/ that if a man douteth/ he 
maye knowe how to helpe him selfe. 
 
I rede/ that if a man do eat thre carnels of Almondes/ he doth not lightely 
waxe dronken. He y=t= knoweth he is greued wyth that impediment/ the 
[/49./] 
same ought so much the more take hede to him selfe/ lest that rudenesse and 
misbehaucour happen to hym: for it maketh feble euery mannis body and 
soule/ his vnderstandynge/ witte and honestie/ etc. 
 
If a man is greatly thyrstinge/ and dare not drinke his fill/ the same shal 
[/50./] 
slake hys thyrste of thys wyse: Lette him take flint stones/ the bignesse of a 
Wallnut/ and laye them in colde water/ and nowe and than lette him take 
one of them into his mouth/ that shall make hym moyste. 
 
[}For the fallinge euell.}] 
 
AGaynst the falling euell or syknesse/ take miscelden of oken tre wyth 
[/51./] 
the barke an vnce miscelden/ of Pere tre half an vnce/ the parynge of 
the toppet of hertes horne a quarter of an vnce: make of these thynges a 
pouder/ and geue the patient thereof to drincke/ the more he drinketh therof/ 
the better it is/ and thys must he do fastinge. 
 
Putte also of the pouder into a cloth/ and laye it vnder hys head wythoute 
hys knoweledge/ and lette hym slepe there vpon. 
 
Thys pouder must he vse in the morning fastynge/ and to bedwarde at 
euen/ and lette the pouder be refreshed euerye night. Lette also the pouder 
to be layde vnder hys head/ and the pouder that he drinketh/ be of like weighte. 
Thys doth helpe hym. 
 
Macer writeth that the rootes of Peony be verye good for the fallinge 
syknesse/ if they be hanged aboute the necke. Galene dothe also write of a 
[/52./] 
chylde/ whych had the roote of Peonye hanging about hys neck/ and was 
fre all that whyle of the fallinge sicknesse/ that it was about it: and when it 
was fallen of by chaunce/ than gat it his former disease agayne. 
 
Hipocrates sayth also/ that he dyd tye a chylde of fyue yeares the rote of 
Peony aboute the necke/ and it rose continentlye agayne from the fallinge 
sycknesse/ and was hole: and thus is it twyse proued. 
 
If it be a man y=t= is greued wyth thys disease/ let thesame take a he Wolues 
harte/ and make it to pouder/ and let him vse that agaynste the disease: 
but if it is a woman/ let her take a she Wolues harte/ &c. 
 
[^f.8v^] 
[}A wounderfull pouder for the falling sycnesse.}] 
 
TAke a liuinge or quick molle/ open him/ and take out the entrailes/ and 
[/53./] 
cast them awaye. After that put the Molle wyth skinne and alltogether 
into an earthen or stone pott/ stoppe the same wel and close wyth clay/ 
set it then by the fyre/ and let it stande vntill the moll is consumed holye to 
pouder. After that laye the same pouder vpon a marbel stone/ that is clene 
washed/ & take the iuyce of Cousloppe leaues or rotes two vnces/ & grinde 
the same wyth the pouder in the Sonne. The nexte daye grinde it agayne 
wyth the iuyce/ & agayne the thyrd daye/ and let it alway drye in the Son. 
After that take the rotes of Basil/ and stampe them/ and take an vnce of y=e= 
same iuyce/ and mixe them together wyth the forsayd pouder/ as is sayde of 
the Cousloppes/ but no more saue ones. After take the rotes of Gentian dried/ 
& make a pouder thereof: of thissame pouder mixe a quarter of an vnce 
with the forsayd pouder. After that take an vnce and an halfe of the rote of 
Peony/ made to pouder/ and mixe it wyth y=e= pouder specifyed before. Hange 
also a root of Peony about the neck. Drinke of the forsayd pouders a quarter 
of an vnce wyth bloode warme wyne/ lye doune to bed/ and couer thy 
selfe warme. After that in thy meate to beddewarde put the other quarter 
of the pouder/ and do so whyle the pouder lasteth. Eate litle at nighte/ no 
entrayles of beastes/ as harte/ lyuer/ &c. nor sucker/ and kepe good diet/ and 
thou shalt be hole. 
 
[}To knowe whether a man be possessed wyth an euill 
sprit/ and how he maye be holpen.}] 
 
INsania/ in Latin signifyeth Madnesse/ thesame commeth somtyme 
[/54./] 
of euill meates/ somtyme of ouermuche drinckinge/ or if a 
man beynge hote/ drinketh colde drinke/ somtyme of superfluous 
slyme that lyeth in the stomacke of meates that be not well digested/ 
somtyme of meates that be hote of complexion/ as are garleke/ pepper 
and suche lyke. Somtyme doth it come of the bytynge of a mad beast/ 
or of an infecte ayer/ or anger/ or ouermuche sorowe/ somtyme also of euyll 
moysture/ or that a man hath had no naturall siege a great season/ and the 
corruption is rotten within him/ and the vapors are risen vp into his head/ 
and the braynes are perfumed and corrupte therewyth/ whyche causeth a 
man then to be wytlesse and ragious. 
 
If the madnesse commeth of the blood/ then doth man singe and is merye/ 
[/55./] 
somtyme thynketh he/ that he is in heauen/ or els that some bodye talketh 
to hym/ saynge he is God/ or an angel: somtyme that he is ryche and 
welthy. 
 
[/56./] 
But if the madnesse commeth of congeled or burnt bloode/ the same are 
somtyme a litle mery/ after that waxe they angrye/ crye and beate themselues 
[/57./] 
and another. 
 
If it commeth of colde and drought/ then doth he alwaye gloome/ wepe/ 
and feare hym/ that is not to be feared. Somtyme thincketh he that the 
stickes and strawes he seeth/ are serpe~tes/ todes or such venemout beastes/ 
[^f.9r^] 
he crepeth into the darcke/ bendeth his handes together/ wening some body 
will take ought out of them: somtyme croweth he like a cocke/ somtyme 
barketh he like a dogge/ and many such folish toyes vseth he. 
 
[/58./] 
But if it commeth of Flegma/ then are hys braynes corrupt and slymed 
wyth colde/ and thereof becommeth he madde: to suche one doth the deuill 
gladly accompany/ and so is he possessed. 
 
He that is becomme madde wyth sadnesse and heuinesse/ to him oughte 
[/59./] 
fayre be spoken and made merye/ manye thinges shoulde be promised him/ 
and some be geuen. If it is a man/ thesame ought to be refreshed wyth weomen/ 
thesame auoydeth anger. But if it is a woman/ thesame ought to be refreshed 
wyth men/ and to their company admitted: thesame bringeth them 
to their right minde agayne. It is good also to geue them meates of good 
digestion/ as mutton/ chykens/ new layd egges/ whyte breade and drinkes 
not to stronge. If they haue no sieges/ then gyue the~ pillulas cochie to bedward/ 
thesame purge the heade. It is to be considered also/ that if he haue 
muche blood/ then ought he to be letten in the middelmost veyne of the forhead: 
sixe dayes after ought he to be letten blood vpon both the handes/ by 
the thombe in the Cephalica. Let him vse meates and drinkes cold of complexion/ 
let him not drinke wine. 
 
[}Thys drinke were good for suche one.}] 
 
TAke a dishe full of barly/ Licoris an vnce and an halfe/ cut y=t= same smal 
[/60./] 
and take an handfull of Waybred/ and seth all this in a quare of fayre 
water/ strayne it than through a cloth/ and let him drinke of it. It is good also 
to wash his head in lye/ where in floures of Camomille are sodden & Veruine/ 
of eche a hand full in a quarte of water/ thesame comforteth the head. 
 
If the madnesse were of Flegma or of superfluous colde/ whereby the 
[/61./] 
braynes were cooled/ then let him eat meates that maye warme him/ & let 
him kepe hym selfe warme: but first ought he be purged of thys wyse: Take 
the leaues of Sena/ made to pouder a quarte of an vnce/ fyne sucker halfe 
an vnce/ and an egges shale full of aqua vite as muche of Buglosse water/ 
as muche of good whyte wyne/ and so muche broth of Peasen/ as alltogether: 
lette the same be warme/ and put all these thinges together/ and beate 
them well: of this geue him to drinke in the dawninge/ or when the daye 
breaketh. If he will not take it by him selfe/ then open his mouth by force/ 
and poure it into thesame. The thyrde daye after geue hym to bedward iij. 
pilles of cochia/ and let no ayer come to him. 
 
If it is in winter/ then kepe him warme in a close chamber both night 
& daye. But if it is in summer/ then laye him in a chamber that is somwhat 
high/ and make him a fyre of Iuniper wood/ whereon the berries are/ for y=t= 
is very good for him. It were good also to put saffron into his drincke and 
meates/ his best meates were old hennes or cockes well sodden/ for they do 
both warme and comforte him. 
 
And if he hath greate heate in his head/ then make him thys collyrium: 
[/62./] 
Take Housleke and leaues of Roses of like quantitie/ well beaten and mixt 
wyth womens milke/ strake the same aboute his temples/ thesame couleth 
[^f.9v^] 
the blood/ and alayeth the raginge: let him beware of stronge drinkes. 
 
If a man is madde/ and it is not knowen wherof it commeth/ take the 
[/63./] 
lounge or lightes of a Goate buck/ and binde the same warme aboute hys 
heade/ thesame alayeth the rage. Or els take a blacke henne/ and open her 
quicke vpon the backe/ and laye the same so warme to the head. But if it is 
a woman or mayden/ then take the lounge or lightes of a Goate. 
 
If a man becommeth madde of colde/ then were it good furth wyth to 
[/64./] 
take a black henne quicke/ and rippe the same vp vpon the backe/ and laye 
her wyth blood and all vpon the head: for the same doth warme his heade 
and braynes very well. 
 
[}A good drinke for one that rageth/ and specially 
it if is come of colde.}] 
 
TAke a quarter of an vnce of beaten saffron/ half an vnce of Cinamon/ 
[/65./] 
half an vnce of aqua vite/ and put this into a pint of wyne. 
The speces ought to be knitt in a linnen cloth. And let him drinke 
a good draught therof in the morning and eueninge. 
 
It is good also if he vse speces in his drinke prepared of thys wyse: Take 
[/66./] 
a quarter of an vnce of Saffron/ Cynamon a quarter of an vnce/ Clowes 
a quarter of an vnce/ Sugar an vnce/ make therof a confection: the-same 
doth comforte the head and braynes very well. Or els geue hym the 
sedes of Peony beaten small/ temper the same wyth wine/ and geue it hym 
to drinke/ that getteth hym hys wittes. 
 
It is good also to take the harte and liuer of a fyshe called a Pyck/ and 
[/67./] 
put thesame into a pott wyth glowyng hote cooles/ and holde the same to 
the patient/ so that the smoke maye entre into hym. If he is possessed/ he can 
not abyde that smoke/ but rageth and is angry. 
 
It is good also to make a fyre in hys chamber of Iuniper wood that is 
grene/ and caste into the fyre Franckincense and S. Ihons grasse or S. 
[/68./] 
Ihons worte: for the euill spretes can not abyde thys sent/ & waxe angrye/ 
wherby may be perceiued whether a ma~ be possessed of an euel spret or not. 
 
The cure of all these euils is (without God will punishe them of a seuerall 
wyse.) They shall take and vse two egges shels ful of Aqua vite/ & thre 
[/69./] 
tymes as muche of other wine/ mixte among it/ a quarter of an vnce of pouder 
of Sene/ thesame let hym vse thre morninge fastinge. Or els let hym 
vse Aqua vite/ where in is styped fumitory/ or the mary of Walwurt/ or the 
stone Lazulus/ or Garmander/ or Brake of the wall/ whyche all do purge 
black colera or Melancoly: For wyth purginge black colera/ is the splene 
clensed/ and there wyth auoyd the straunge thoughtes and imaginacions/ 
the pensiffenesse and melancoly is dryuen out/ and the braynes get agayne 
theyr force or strength/ and are encreased. Wherfore if this be done/ then is 
the euell sprete or will dryuen out/ and all wycked thoughtes are forgetten. 
If man be thus tended/ than commeth he agayne to hys ryght naturall vnderstandinge. 
Neuerthelesse the forsayde medecins must be ministred to 
hym ether whan soueuer the panges come vpon hym/ or whan he semeth to 
be fre of them/ that they maye minishe by processe of tyme/ or els hinder so 
[^f.10r^] 
muche the lesse. If any chylde weare Peony sede about hys body/ no euell 
sprete can hinder him. 
 
Item x. or xij. sedes of Peony beaten wyth wyne/ & then dronke/ auoyde 
[/70./] 
the disease called Incubus/ that is the Mare/ whych is a sycknesse or fantasye 
oppressinge a man in his slepe/ that him semeth a great weyght/ lye vpon 
his body/ wherfore he groneth and sigheth/ but can not speake. 
 
[/71./] 
If a man were desperate or frantike by fantesyes and hys wittes were 
spred abrode/ if thou wilt gather agayn y=e= scattered wittes: the~ take a greate 
basin/ set it sedelinges to a wall/ so that it do leane holy vpon the wall/ then 
take a lauer wyth a cock full of water/ set that hygh vpon a coupborde or other 
thyng/ open y=e= cock a litle/ so y=t= the water drop by litle and litle vpon y=e= basin/ 
and make a ringinge/ and runne out of the basin agayn. Into this chamber 
or place lay the patient/ so that he can not se this/ nor let not much be spoken 
to him: then doth he muse and fantasye so much vpon y=e= dropping & ringing/ 
what it maye be/ willing gladly know what it is/ y=t= at the last he fasteneth 
his wittes/ & gathered them agayne. If the water fayle/ the~ fill y=e= lauer 
agayne. Also may be geuen to him the souerayne water of Buglosse.
