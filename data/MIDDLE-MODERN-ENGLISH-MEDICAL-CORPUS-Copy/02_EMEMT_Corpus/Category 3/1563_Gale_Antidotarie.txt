[}The seconde booke of 
the Antidotarie, Contayning the medicynes 
compounde: and their waye of composition, 
with theyr vertues and properties. 
by Thomas Gale Mayster in 
Chirurgerye.}] 
 
IN the former booke (louynge 
Reader) of thys Antidotarye I 
haue set oute breefelye and eke 
compendiouslie, such medicines 
simple and compounde as are 
required in the curatiue intentions 
of Chirurgerye: nowe I thynke good in 
this seconde booke, to declare the compositions 
of all such co~poundes as are there remembred, 
and be of most price in the arte. Vnto whiche 
I haue also added no smal number of vnguents 
oyles, Balmes, Emplasters, Cerotes, wounde 
drynke, &c, of myne owne inuention. And here 
note, that there is difference betwyxt the grecians, 
and the later writers, touchinge the 
names of these compound medicynes. For the 
Grecians dyd call vnguentes onely aromatick 
oyles, wherewyth they dyd annoynt the body. 
The Cerotes they called suche medicynes as 
receyued into their composition oyle and waxe. 
Emplasters be medicynes whyche take into 
their composition dyuers kyndes of symples, 
[^f.7v^] 
but chefelye metallyen bodyes and these are so 
longe to be boyled together, vntill they wyll no 
longer defyle, and cliue to the handes. Cataplasmes, 
be medicines standing on herbes, flowres 
oiles, wheat, barly, ote, beane and other flower. 
Which are not so long to be boyled on the fyre, 
as emplasters are. Trochisce, be compositions 
made rounde and were deuised to keepe longe 
tyme such symples in their force which do enter 
in other compositions. Pouders be medicynes 
beaten and made subtile and fyne lyke mootes 
of the sonne, as they call them. Waters are 
prepared diuers wayes by the arte of Alchimie. 
Decoctions, lotions, and iniections, be liquors 
and other thynges boyled together and then 
strayned. What quantitie of euerye symple 
should be admitted to euerye forme of composition 
can not in generall rules be set oute, but 
doth varye accordynge to the curatiue intentions. 
Perticuler formes of compoundes suche 
as be of moste price, and vsed: shall folowe in 
thys saconde booke: as also there way to make 
them, and to what vse they serue: begynnynge 
fyrst wyth vnguentes.

in, it shall dye there rather then go out of it. To

doth, but more effectually all thynges. Beyng

be it neuer so yll: and also, Noli me tangere all 
diseases brede of steame and colde humours it 
healeth them, yf a linnen cloth dypped in it be 
layde vpon the place where the grease is, it putteth 
away vtterly the palsey and all trimblinge 
of members, it strengthneth meruelously the sinewes: 
[^f.36r^] 
it is whotter then the first and second, if 
a man put a droppe of it in hys hand, it perceth 
strayte without greefe. To conclud, it doth many 
other thynges, and all diseases rysen of a cold 
cause, it health them, if they vse it ryght according 
to arte. All this is Lullius sayng.
