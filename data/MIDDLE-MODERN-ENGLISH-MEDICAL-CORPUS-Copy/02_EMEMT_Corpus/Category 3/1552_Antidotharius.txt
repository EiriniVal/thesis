And weake of this that is nede to weke in

[}To make a grene wounded 
playster.}] 
 
THe good grene wounded playster, that 
the newe surgyans occupy, that heleth 
all fresshe woundes without tentes, & it is a 
[^f.A2r^] 
mundificatiuum, a conglutinatiuum, and a 
consolidatiuum, and this plaster is, of many 
and dyuers maners of sundry maysters made 
some take moche Rosyn, and lytell waxe. 
Some moche waxe, and lytell Rosyn. And 
some take waxe & Rosyn alyke moch, and 
some take no Rosyn at all. Therfore ye shal 
know as ye wyl that this same playster shal 
more heale than clense, lyke as it is nedely in 
the wounde of the hede, & in a simple wounde 
there as no substaunce is loste. If that ye 
take more waxe in weyght so moch the lesser 
take of Rosyn in weyght, and let them twayne 
euery time in his weyght and as ye wyl that 
it clense more takyng to her the matter, lyke 
as a depe stytched wounde, whiche maketh 
moche mater than shall you take more Rosyn 
than waxe, as ye haue sayd If ye wyll 
that the playster shall make flesshe to growe 
and shall serue to all woundes whiche somewhat 
hathe loste of his substaunce, than take 
Rosyn, and waxe of eche a lyke moche, or yf 
ye wyll that it make the skyne, and that the 
wounde shulde close, than take waxe alone, 
and no Rosyn, and as in this playster is moche 
Rosyn, and lytell waxe, then it is called a 
mundificatiuum, and attractiuum that is, 
[^f.A2v^] 
clensynge, and drawynge out the matter, yf 
ther be therin moche waxe and lytell Rosyn, 
than it is called conglutinatiuum, that is together 
leuynge and closynge of the wounde. 
And if there be therin waxe and Rosyn lyke 
moch: than it is called incarnatiuum that is 
flesshe makynge in the wounde. Or yf there 
be therin waxe & no Rosyn, than it is called 
consolidatiuum, that is healyng and skyne 
makyng. And this playster is made thus. 
Take resine de pino, that is whyte rosyn, 
Mayden waxe, of eche two pounde, & that rosyn 
which is clere as Turpentyne. Deresute

seth the paler it waxeth. But these herbes be 
not so holsome as the other be, neuerthelesse 
some maysters doth this sap therin, and they 
knowe not what vertue and power they haue. 
The Nyghtshawe coleth and softeth, so 
dothe the Eldre also, and Celidonia cleseth 
therfore as ye put in this salue moch Rosyn, 
so may ye the better this same sap do therto 
and .ii. or .iii. ounces of Myrta, than clense it

withoute a mundificatiuum for that
