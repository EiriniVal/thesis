[}De Aloe. Ca. I.}] 
 
[^An image of a plant omitted.^] 
ALoe is hote & drie 
of complexion in 
the .ii. degre Aloe 
is made of the iuce 
of an herbe named 
Aloen. But 
we call it Cynibre 
This herbe 
groweth in Inde 
Perse/ and Poole/ And there ben iii. maners 
of Aloen/ Cycotryn/ Epatye and Cabalyn/ 
And it is made in this maner. The 
herbe is powned and y=e= Iuce wronge out/ 
and set on the fyre/ and whan it boyleth it 
is taken from the fyre and sete in the sonne 
to waxe thycke/ and that is take vpperest 
is the moost pure/ and that is Cycotryne/ 
That in the myddes is Epatye/ And that 
in the botom is Cabalyn/ whiche is cours 
and erthy/ and that opynion is fals/ But 
we say that they ben made of .iii. dyfferent 
herbes/ not of kynde but in goodnesse 
as of dyuers good grapes ben made dyfferent 
wynes. The best Aloe is the Cycoreyne/ 
and it is knowen by the colour that is 
yelowe/ drawynge to browne/ and specyally 
whan it is broken the powdre of it is 
lyke powdre of saffron/ and also the substau~ce 
of it whan it is broken in small pyces 
is clere and subtyle/ & breketh lyghtly 
And also is it knowen whan it stynketh 
not nor is to bytter/ and somtyme is gommy/ 
and somtyme bryttyll. The colour of 
Aloe epatye is lyke y=e= colour of lyuer/ drawyng 
to blacke/ and hath holes here and 
there lyke the endes of vaynes and the substau~ce 
therof is deed and vnclere and hath 
the sygnes of the Cycotryne/ saufe that it 
is weyker of colour. Aloe Cabalyn is 
blacke and dymme/ the substaunce therof 
is erthy & very bytter with horryble stynkynge 
sauour. This Aloe cabalin is somtyme 
made so craftely that is semeth Epatye 
or Cycotryne And though in this boke 
we put the craftynesse or deceyt or medycynes/ 
It is not bycause we wolde not that 
it sholde be made/ but to eschew y~ frawde 
of them that selleth it/ and thus it is made 
deceytful. It is put in vyneygre w~ Oryent 
saffron with a lytell of a nutmygge or 
other swete smellynge spyce/ and than broken 
in the peyces very small. And bounde 
with thredes/ and it is put often in vyneygre 
and than dryed/ and so is done x. or .xii. 
tymes tyll it chaungeth colour and smell 
& it is styreth so longe that it semeth Epatye or 
Cycotryne/ so y~ scantly is ony dyffere~ce 
to be seen/ but it is knowen in the brekynge/ 
for than it stynkyth/ and so dooth 
not the other two. And it is to be knowen 
that all thynge of his nature ought to be 
Aromatyke and of swete smell/ for y=e= sweter 
it smelleth the better it is. And so all 
thynges that in theyr kyne ought to haue 
ony sauour y~ moost comyn is best/ except 
Aloe/ for how be it that it ought to be bytter 
of his nature/ yet the lesse it is byt_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
the better it is. 
 
[}To purge flewmes. A}] 
 
[^f.A1v^] 
Aloe hath vertue to purge & clense flewmes/ 
and humours of melancoly. Also it 
hath vertue to confort the senewy membres/ 
& auayleth agaynst colde humours 
conteyned in the stomake/ and easeth the 
payne of the heed caused of fumes rysynge 
fro the stomake. 
 
[}To clere the syght 
and scabbeys. B}] 
 
It clereth the syght and vnstoppeth the 
opylacyons of the lyuer/ and the mylt/ it 
prouoketh the floures to women/ and clenseth 
the superfluytees that ben out of the 
pudens or preuy membres/ yf it be caused 
of colde. It healeth the scabbeys/ and 
yeldeth good colour to them that haue none 
comynge by sekenesse. 
 
[}To stoppe the blood of 
a wou~de. C}] 
 
It stoppeth the blood of a wounde/ and 
closeth it/ yf playsters be made with whyte 
of an egge/ and oyle/ layde to the wou~de 
often. And is good agaynst fallynge of 
the heare. 
 
[}Agaynst flewmatike 
humours. D}]

indygestyon/ with .ii. drammes of Mastyke/ 
yf it be colde it chauffeth/ and yf it 
be feble it conforteth 
 
[}For the stomake. E}] 
 
For the same a grayne of aloe gyuen w=t= 
hony clenseth the stomake/ and procureth 
dygestyon. Pewdre of Mastyke and aloe 
medled togyder/ and soden in white wyne 
ought to be gyuen for the same. Or elles 
drawe the tongue out of the mouthe as ferre 
as ye may/ and lay .ii. graynes of Aloe 
depe theron that it may be swalowed/ and 
though Aloe be bytter in the mouthe/ yet 
it is swete and good in the stomake. And 
therfore it is called Glistonia/ that is to 
say bytter. Epiglistonia is that it is swete 
for the stomake. 
 
[}For payne of the heed. F}] 
 
Also the Ierapigra wherin is put good 
Aloe auayleth to the payne in the heed and 
clereth the syght. 
 
[}For the syght G}] 
 
Also Iera co~sra~tyne medled with good 
Aloe is profytable for the syght. Also to 
claryfye the syght. Aloe take~ onely/ or w=t= 
Mirabolamum confect and dronke. Take 
two dra~mes of Aloe/ and one of Mastyke 
or of dragantum with Syrope and luke 
warme water for that is proued to claryfy 
the syght. 
 
[}For the lyuer 
and for the mylte. H}] 
 
Agaynst opylacyon of the lyuer or of y~ 
mylte/ take Aloe w~ iuce of smalache warme/ 
or make decoccyo~ of y~ rotes of smalache/ 
percely/ fenell/ benworte/ & sparge w~ 
two drammes of mastyke/ and vse it ii. or 
iii. tymes in the weke. This decoccyo~ prouoketh 
the floutes to women a supposytory 
made of tryfera magna with powdre 
of Aloe Epatye vpon it. 
 
[}For yll colour. I}] 
 
Agaynst yll colour caused of the coldenesse

specyally yf it come by opylacyon of the lyuer. 
Take a dramme of Aloe/ and halfe a 
dra~me of mastyke with an vnce of worm 
wood .ii. tymes in the weke/ and it wyll 
preserue from fallynge in to the dropsy in 
the begynnynge as we haue proued it. 
 
[}For wormes in the bely 
and eares K}] 
 
The powdre of Aloe taken with hony 
fleeth wormes in the bely/ and with the 
herbe Percicarya called Arssmert/ it sleth 
wormes and beestes/ that is entred in to 
the eares yf it be dropped in them. 
 
[}For fallynge of the heare. L}] 
 
[^f.A2r^] 
Agaynst fallynge of the heate/ boyle 
the rote of an olde olyue tre in vyneygre/

[}De ligno Aloes Cap. ii.}] 
 
[^An image of a plant omitted.^] 
ALoes is a wood and is hote and 
drye in the .ii. degre. This wood 
is founde in a flode of hye Babylone 
nygh wherby renneth a ryuer of Paradyse 
terrestre/ and some saye that by the 
swyftnesse of the same ryuer that wood is 
brought thyder. Other saye y=t= it groweth 
on the hylles and desertes afore sayd/ and 
byforce of the wynde/ and by aege of the 
trees it falleth in that ryuer/ and y~ dwellers 
by y~ sayd ryuer ferre fro the sayd hylles 
do cast nettes in that water and take 
by this wood. There ben .iii. maners of 
this wood/ one is founde in an ylond called 
Cume/ and that is y~ best of all. There 
is in another yle called Tamear/ and is 
not so good: The other is in an yle called 
Franne/ and that is the worst. The fyrst 
is knowen bycause it is heuy full of knottes/ 
and smelleth swete/ and hath a bytter 
sauour/ and the colour is blacke or lyke 
russet. The seconde kynde of Aloes is not 
so heuy/ nor so bytter/ nor so well smellynge/ 
and is lesse in vertue. The .iii. is some 
what whyte and is not bytter/ and hath 
no sauour but yf it be made by crafte/ and 
it is called seruleu~. The tre Aloes is cou~terfayte 
in the mountaynes of a countre 
called Almaphea with a wood or tre named 
Camelia/ lyke vnto lignum Aloes/ 
for it is heuy/ knotty/ and of swete smell 
and some call it wylde Aloes. This wood 
is rubber w=t= tynne or leed to make it chau~ge 
colour/ & eare waxe is put on it to make 
it bytted/ and that it loke russet. Than it 
is boyled in wyne/ wherin is powdre of 
good Aloes with muske to make it smell 
swet/ & thus it is so tourned that scantly it 
is knowe~ from the good Aloes. But there 
is dyffere~ce/ for it is harde vnder the tethe 
and wha~ it is chewed that that is within 
hath no bytternesse. 
 
[}To confort the stomacke. A}] 
 
The wood or lignum Aloes conforteth 
the stomacke and maketh good dygestyon 
It is good agaynst the feblenesse or y~ hert 
and of the brayne. Agaynst the cordya_[^ORIG. BLURRED^] 
passyon and swownynge/ and agaynst the

in the mornynge drynke the wyne/ also y=e= 
decoccyon therof with auens/ and mastic 
procureth dygestyon/ & conforteth the stomake 
and brayne. For them that ben to delycate. 
Take .ii. dra~mes of lygnu~ aloes & 
clowes/ & lay them in wyne one nyght/ & 
drynke the wyne in the mornynge w~ rose 
water. Suche wyne may be kept longe in 
vertue by reason of the Aloes. 
 
[}For the brayne. B}] 
 
Agaynst swownynge and feblenes of y~ 
brayne. Take Sirope with powdre of 
lignum Aloes/ the bone in a hertes herte/ 
clowes/ and roses/ and sethe them all togyder 
with suger. Fumygacyon made of 
lignum Aloes and gyuen to a woman benethe 
prouoketh the floures/ and helpeth 
the suffocacyon of the matryce/ and it behoueth 
the woman to be wrapped with 
clothes that the same come not in her nose. 
Inlykewyse Tryfera magna is a confeccyon/ 
whiche taken with wyne/ that hath 
be soden with lignum Aloes pronoketh y=e= 
floures. Or elles take Trifera magna 
fyrst/ and than the sayd wyne. The smoke 
of lignum Aloes conforteth and heteth y=e= 
colde brayne and all the weyke membres 
of the body. 
 
[}De Auro. Golde. Ca .iii.}] 
 
AUrum. Golde is the moost attempered 
of all metalles. Now 
be it is hote/ but y~ heet is meane 
without excesse/ therfore it is put in no 
degre. Golde is made of a vayne of y=e= erthe 
by decoccion or meltynge/ and by the same 
decoccyon the superflue is deuyded and is 
called Cucuma auri/ the scu~me of golde. 
[^An image of a man emptying a pot onto a table omitted.^] 
We wyll not as now determyn howe 
many maners of Golde there be/ nor how 
they be knowen. 
 
[}Agaynst elefance. A}] 
 
Golde hath vertue to conforte & to clense/ 
and therfore it is good agaynst elefance/

sco~me of golde and oyle taketh away the 
skall fro the heed and the face. It may 
be demaunded how golde dooth confort/ 
syth it is not dygested/ and entreth not in 
to the substau~ce of the body & nouryssheth 
not For solucyon herof. It is to wyte 
that of thynges that confort/ some cofort 
onely/ by cause they repayre the spyrytes 
as thynges that smell swetely/ other conforteth 
by cause they restore the membres 
as meate and drynke. Other restrayne the

[}De Apio. Smalache 
or stammarche. Cap. viii.}] 
 
There be dyuers maners of Apium 
or Smalache/ as shall be shewed 
here after/ but we speake of the comune. 
Fyrst it is hote in the begynnynge 
of the thyrde degre/ and drye in the myddes 
of the same. It is a comune herbe/ the 
sede therof is moost of vertue/ the rote is 
nexte/ and than the leues. And therfore 
whan it is founde in receptes. Recipi apii 
that is take smalache without addycyon 
[^f.A5r^] 
[^An image of a plant omitted.^] 
the sede is to be taken. It hath dyuers names/ 
as Apium sillinu~ Albal Carasis/ or 
Sascarpsi. 
 
[}For strangory. A}] 
 
The iuce of smalache soden with Saxifrage 
is good for them that haue the stra~gory/ 
and pysse drope by drope/ & for them 
that haue dyssury and may not pysse/ take 
y~ same drynke in the mornynge with Mel 
Solaris. Phylipendula/ and sethe them 
togyder and strayne them/ than put therto 
suger and make a Syrope/ and drynke it. 
 
[}For stoppynge of the lyuer. B}] 
 
Iuce of Smalache soden with Tamaryke 
vnstoppeth the oppylacyons of the lyuer/ 
and of the mylt. Or elles sethe rotes 
of smalache/ parcyly/ & fenell & drynke it. 
 
[}For Iaundys. C}] 
 
For Iaundys/ cause of opylacyo~ do make 
a Sirope of the iuce of Smalache and 
fenell soden with the iuce of Fumoterre/ and 
suger/ and that destroyeth the flewme. 
For them that haue the dropsy called Leucoflemence 
or yposarca. Take a pounde 
of the iuce Smalache and an vnce of Mastyke/ 
sethe them togyder/ and strayne the~

make a purgacyon/ than sethw Agaryc w~ 
the iuce of Smalache in the apple of colloquintida 
called a gourde of Alexandre/ 
or in a rote called malu~ terre/ or swynes 
brede/ and with the water and decoccyon 
gyue it to the pacyent: It is to be noted 
that Smalache is not good for women 
with chylde/ for by the myght of it/ it breketh 
the strynges that the chylde is bou~de 
within the matryce. It noyeth the Epyle~tykes 
that fall/ for it moueth the maters 
and humours/ and causeth them to moue 
in to the vpper partyes. There is another 
maner of Smalache called Apium ramium/ 
wylde smalache. Also there is Apiu~ 
risus/and Apium Emorroidarium/ and 
all ben smalaches. 
 
[}For the backe. F}] 
 
Apiu~ ramium soden in wyne and oyle/ 
layde to the reynes/ and bely appealeth y~ 
ache/ and the strangury/ and it is called 
Apium/ by cause it is good for the reynes

and his absence lessed foloweth y~ co~trary/ 
that myrth/ and by consequence risus 
that is laughter/ & therfore it is sayde 
Splen ridere facit. The mylte causeth to 
laugh/ for it clenseth the blode of humour 
melancolyke. 
 
[}Agaynst stra~gury & dyssury. K}] 
 
Apium risus soden in water or in wyne 
is good agaynst stra~gury/ dissury & esurie 
Also the decoccyon therof alone auayleth 
chyefly agaynst the stone. The lactuary 
called Litiontipon gyuen with decoccyon 
of apium risus/ prouoketh the floures in 
women. And lete fume be made vnder or 
elles the iuce put warme in to the matryce. 
Some say that yf it be take~ at y~ mouth 
it sleeth a man in laughyng/ and it is founde
