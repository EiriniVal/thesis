[}THE SECRETS 
OF ALBERTVS 
MAGNVS.}] 
 
[}The first Booke of the Vertues 
of Hearbes.}] 
 
ARistotle the Prince of 
Philsophers saith in many 
places, that euery science 
is of the kinde of 
good things: But notwithstanding, 
the operation sometime is 
good and sometime euill: as the science is 
changed vnto a good, or to an euill end, to 
the which it worketh. Of the which saying, 
two things are concluded: The first 
is that the science of Magicke is not euil, 
for by the knowledge of it, euill may bee 
eschewed, and good by meanes thereof, 
may be followed. 
 
[^f.A3v^] 
The second thing is also concluded, for 
so much as the effect is praised & so highly 
esteemed for the end, and also the ende 
of science is dispraised, when it is not ordained 
to good, or to vertue. It followeth 
then that euery science or facultie, or operation, 
is sometime good, and sometime 
euill. 
 
Therfore, because science of Magicke 
is a good knowledge (as it is presupposed) 
and is somewhat euill in beholding of 
causes and natural things, as I haue considered 
and perceiued in very many ancient 
authors: yea and Albert my selfe 
haue found out the truth in many things 
and I suppose or imagine the trueth to be 
in some part of of the Booke of Chirander, 
and also the booke of Alchorac. 
 
First therefore, I will shew and declare 
the natures and vertues of certaine 
Hearbes. Secondly, the operation & estimation 
of certaine Stones, and their vertues. 
And thirdly of certaine Beastes, 
and the vertues of them.

[^End of the list.^] 
 
All these forenamed hearbs shalt thou 
find in their seuerall places, with their 
wonderfull operation, and workings, but 
yet if thou dost not obserue the times and 
seasons, wherin they should be ministred 
and put in practise, all thy labour is of 
none effect. 
 
[^f.A4v^] 
The first hearbe is called with the men 
of Chaldee, Elos, with the Greekes, 
Matuchiol, with the Latins, Elitropium 
with the Englishmen, Marigolde: whose 
interpretation is of Elion that is the son, 
and Tropos that is alteration, or change, 
because it is turned according to the sun. 
The vertue of this hearb is maruellous: 
for if it be gathered, the Sunne being in 
the signs Leo in August, and wrapped in 
the leafe of a Lawrell, or Bay tree, and a 
Wolfes tooth added thereto, no man shall 
be able to haue one word to speake against 
the bearer thereof, but words of peace: If 
any thing bee stollen, and the bearer of 
the things before named, lay them vnder 
his head in the night, he shal see the theefe 
and all his conditions. Moreouer, if the aforesaid 
hearbe bee put in any Church, 
where women be, which haue broken 
matrimony on their part: they shall neuer 
be able to goe forth of the Church, except 
it be put away. And this last point 
hath been proued, and is very true. 
 
The second hearbe is named of the 
Chaldee Roibra, of the Greekes Olieribus, 
[^f.A5r^] 
of the Latins, or Frenchmen Vrtica 
of Englishmen a Nettle. He that holdeth 
this hearb in his hand, with an hearb called 
Milfoile, or Yarrow, or Nosbleed, is 
sure from all feare, and fantasie, or vision. 
And if it be put with the iuyce of 
Housleeke, and the bearers hand bee annointed 
with it, & the residue put in water, 
if he enter in the water where fishes 
be, they wil gather together to his hands, 
adding thereto ad piscellum. And if his 
hand be drawn forth, they wil leap again 
to their own places, where they were before. 
 
The third hearb is named of the Chaldees 
Lorumboror, of the Greekes Allamor, 
of the Latins Verga Pastoris, of the 
Englishmen wilde Teasell. Take this 
hearbe, and temper it with the iuyce of 
Mandrake, and giue it to a bitch, or to any 
other beast, and it shall be great with 
a yong one in the owne kinde, and shall 
bring forth the birth in the owne kinde, 
of the which yong one, if the gum toothe 
be taken and dipped in the meat or drink, 
euery one that shall drinke thereof, shall 
[^f.A5v^] 
begin anon battell, and when they would 
put it away, giue to him the iuice of Velarian, 
and peace shalbe anon among them 
as before. 
 
The fourth hearb, is named Aquillaris, 
of the Chaldees: because it springeth in 
the time, in which the Eagles build their 
nests. It is named of the Greeks Vallias, 
of the Latins Celidonia, and of English 
men Celindine. This hearbe springeth in 
the time which swallows, & also the Eagles 
make their nests If any man shall 
haue this hearb with the heart of a Mole 
he shall ouercome all his enemies, and all 
matters in suite, and shall put away all 
debate. 
 
And if the before named hearb, bee put 
vpon the head of a sicke man, if he shal die 
he shall sing with a loud voyce, if not, hee 
shall weepe. 
 
The fift hearbe is named of the Chaldees 
Itrisi of the Greeks Vorax, of the 
Latines Prouinca, or Prouinsa, of Englishmen 
Perwinke, when it is beaten 
vnto powder with wormes of the earth 
[^f.A6r^] 
wrapped about it, and with an hearb called 
Semperuina, in English Housleeke, it 
induceth loue betweene man and wife, if 
it be vsed in their meats. And if it shall 
be put to the mouth of the beast called the 
Bugill, and he shall breake anone in the 
midst. And this was proued of late time. 
 
If the said confection be put in the fire 
it shall be turned anone, vnto blue colour. 
 
The sixt hearb is named of the Chaldees 
Bleith, of the Greeks Ketus, of the 
Latines Mepeta, of Englishmen Calaminte, 
otherwise Peniroyall. Take this 
hearb and mixe it with the stone, found in 
the nest of the bird called a Lapwing, or 
blacke Plouer, and rubbe the belly of any 
beast and it shall be with birth, and haue 
a yong one, very blacke in the own kind. 
And if it be put to their nostrils, they shal 
fall to the ground anone as dead, but a 
little space after they shall be healed. Also 
if the aforesaid confection bee put in a vessel 
of bees, the bees shall neuer flie away, 
but they shall gather together there. And 
if the bees be drowned, & look as they were 
dead, if they be put in the aforesaide confection, 
[^f.A6v^] 
they shall recouer their life after a 
litle time, as by the space of one houre, for 
it is proportioned to the quality lost. And 
for a sure proofe, if drowned flies be put in 
warme ashes they will recouer their life 
after a little space. 
 
The seuenth hearbe is named of the 
Chaldees Algeil, of the Greeks Orum, of 
the Latines Lingua canis, of Englishmen, 
Hounds toung. Put thou this hearb 
with the hart of a yong frog, and her matrice, 
and put them where thou wilt, and 
after a litle time all the dogs of the whole 
towne shall be gathered together. And if 
thou shalt haue the afore named hearbe 
vnder thy formost toe, all the dogs shall 
keepe silence, and haue no power also to 
barke. If thou put the aforesaid thing in 
the necke of any dog (so that he may not 
touch it with his mouth) he shalbe turned 
alway round about like a turning wheele 
vntill he fal vnto the ground as dead, and 
this hath been proued in our time. 
 
The eight hearb named of the Chaldees 
Mansela, of the Greekes Ventosin, 
[^f.A7r^] 
of the Latins Iusquianus, of the Englishmen 
Henban. Take thou this hearb, and 
mixe it Cum regalis hermodatalis, put 
them in the meat of a mad dogge, and hee 
will die anone. And if thou put the iuice 
of it with the aforesaid thinge in a siluer 
cup it shall be broken very small. Also if 
thou shalt mixt the aforesaid thing with y=e= 
blood of a yong Hare, and keepe it in the 
skin of a Hare, all the Hares will bee gathered 
there vntill it be remoued. 
 
The ninth hearb is named of the Chaldees 
Ango, of the Greeks Amala, of the 
Latines Lillium, of the Englishmen a lilie. 
If thou wilt gather this hearbe (y=e= sun 
being in the signe of the Lyon) and mix it 
with the iuyce of the Laurel, or Bay tree 
and afterward thou put that iuice vnder 
the dung of cattel a certaine time, it shall 
be turned vnto wormes, of the which, if 
powder be made, and put about the necke 
of any man or in his cloathes, he shall neuer 
sleepe, nor be able to sleepe vntill it bee 
away. Many more things may bee done 
with the vertue and iuice of this aforesaid 
hearb. 
 
[^f.A7v^] 
And if thou put the aforesaid thing vnder 
the dung of cattell, and annoint any 
man with the wormes breeding therof, he 
shal be brought anon vnto a feuer. And if 
the aforesaid thing be put in any vessell 
where there is cows milk, and be couered 
with the skin of any cow of one colour, al 
the kine shall loose their milke. 
 
The tenth hearb is called of the Chaldees 
Luperar, of the Greeke, Assisena, of 
the Latins Viscus querci, Of Englishmen 
Missell toe. And it groweth in trees, being 
holed through, This hearbe with a certaine 
other hearbe, which is named Martegon, 
that is Silphion or Laserpitium, 
as it is written in the Almans language, 
it openeth all lockes. And if the aforesaid 
things mixed together, be put in y=e= mouth 
of any man, that thinketh any thing, if it 
should happen, it is set on his heart, if not, 
it leapeth back from his hart. If the aforesaid 
thing be hanged vp to a tree with the 
wing of a swallow, there the birdes shall 
gather together within the space of fiue 
miles. And this last was prooued in my 
time. 
 
[^f.A8r^] 
The eleuenth hearbe is named of the 
Chaldees Isiphilon, of the Greekes Orgelon, 
of the Latines Centaures, of Englishmen 
Centory, which saith, that this 
hearbe hath a meruellous vertue, for if 
it be ioined with the blood of a female lapwing 
or blacke Plouer, and put with oile 
in a lampe, all they that compasse it about 
shall beleeue themselues to be witches; so 
that one shall beleeue of another, that his 
head is in heauen & his feete on the earth. 
And if the aforesaid thing bee put in the 
fire when the stars shine, it shall appeare 
that the starres run one against another, 
and fight. And if the aforesaid plaster bee 
put to the nostrils of any man, he shall fly 
away sharpely, through feare that he shal 
haue, and this hath beene prooued. 
 
The twelfe hearb is named of the Chaldees 
Coloria, or Coloricon, of the Greeks 
Calamor, of the Latines commonly Saluia, 
of the Englishmen Sage. This hearb 
being purified vnder dung of cattell, in a 
glasen vessell, bringeth foorth a certaine 
worme or bird, hauing a taile after the fashion 
of a bird, called a black mack or Ousell, 
[^f.A8v^] 
with whose blood, if any man be touched 
on the breast, he shall loose his sence 
or feeling the space of fifteene dayes and 
more. And if the aforesaid Serpent bee 
burned, and the ashes of it bee put in the 
fire, anon there shal be a rainebowe, with 
an horrible thunder. 
 
And if the aforesaid ashes be put in a 
lampe and kindled, it shall appeare that 
all the house is full of Serpents and this 
hath been proued of men of late time. 
 
Many more worthy things may be experimented 
and put in practise, but yet I 
counsell thee so goe forward, and by much 
reading thou shalt gather much knowledge, 
and by much knowledge thou maiest 
attaine to vertue. 
 
[^f.B1r^] 
The 13 heard is named of the Chaldees 
Olphauas, of the Greeks, Hiliorion, 
of the Latines Vrbena, of the Englishmen 
Veruin. This hearbe (as Witches 
say) gathered, the Sun being in the signe 
of the Ram, and put with graine or corne 
of Piony of one yere old, heals them that 
are sicke of the falling sickenes, And if it 
be put in a safe ground, after 8 weekes, 
wormes shall be ingendred: which if they 
shall touch any man, he shall die anon. If 
the aforesaid thing be put in a doue or culuer 
house, all the doues or culuers shall 
there gather together. And if the powder 
of them be put in the sunne, it maketh the 
Sun seeme blew. If the powder be put 
in a place where men dwel or lie between 
two louers, anon there is made strife betweene 
them. 
 
The 14 hearbe is named of the Chaldees, 
Celayos, of the Greekes, Casini, of 
the Latines Melisopholos, of Englishmen 
Smallage. Of the which hearb Master 
Floridus maketh mention. This 
hearbe being gathered greene and taken 
with the iuyce of the Cypresse tree, of one 
[^f.B1v^] 
yeare put in gruell, maketh the gruell to 
appeare full of wormes, and maketh the 
hearer to be gentle and gracious, and to 
vanquish his aduersaries. And if the aforesaide 
hearbe bee bounden to an Oxes 
necke, he will follow thee whether soeuer 
thou wilt goe. 
 
THe fifteenth hearbe is named of the 
Chaldeis Glerisa, of the Greekes Isaphinus, 
of the Latines Rosa, of Englishmen 
a Rose. And it is an hearbe, whose 
floure is very well knowne. Take the 
graine or corne of it, and the corne of mustard 
seed, and the foote of a Weasle: hang 
all these in a tree, and it will neuer beare 
fruite after. And if the foresaid thing bee 
put about a net, fishes wil gather together 
there. And if Magaris shall be dead and 
put in the aforesaide commixtion halfe a 
day, it shall recouer the life although it 
be not forthwith yet gotten. And if the aforesaid 
powder be put in a lamp, and after 
be kindled, all men shal appeare black 
as the diuell. Also if the aforesaid powder 
be mixed with oyle of the Oliue tree, and 
quick brimstone, or the house annoynted 
[^f.B2r^] 
with it, when the Sunne shineth it will 
seeme all in a flame. 
 
The sixteenth hearbe is called of the 
Chaldeis Caturlin, of the Greeks Pentaphyllon, 
of the Latines Serpentina, in 
English Snakes grasse. This hearbe is 
well enough knowne with vs: this herb 
put in the ground, with the leafe called 
three leafe grasse, engendereth red & green 
Serpents, of which, if powder be made, 
and put in a burning lampe, there shall 
appeare abundance of serpents. And if it 
be put vnder the head of any man, from 
thenceforth he shall not dreame of himselfe. 
 
The manner of woorking all these aforenamed 
things, that the effect may be 
good in their planets, is in their houres, & 
dayes, and great regard had to the obseruation 
of their due times. 
 
[^f.B2v^] 
There be seuen hearbs that haue great 
vertue, after the minde of Alexander the 
Emperour, and these haue their chiefe 
vertues of the influence of the Planets. 
And therefore euery one of them taketh 
their vertue from the higher naturall 
power. 
 
The first is the hearbe of the Planet 
Saturnius, which is called Affodilius. 
Affodilly, the iuice of it is good against the 
paine of the reines, and legs: let all them 
that suffer paine of the bladder eate it, the 
root of it being a little boild. Likewise, if 
men possessed with euill spirits, or madde 
men beare it, in a cleane napkin, they bee 
deliuered from their disease: and if suffereth 
not a diuell in the house. If children 
that breed their teeth beare it about them, 
they shal breed them without paine: It is 
good that a man beare with him a root of it 
in the night, for he shall not feare, nor yet 
be hurt of other. 
 
The second is the herbe of the Sun, 
which is called Poligonia, or Coraligiola. 
This hearb taketh name of the 
[^f.B3r^] 
Sunne: for it engendreth greatly, and so 
this hearbe worketh many wayes. 
 
Others calleth this hearbe Alchone, 
which is the house of the sun: This herb 
healeth the passions & griefes of the heart 
and stomach; He that toucheth this hearb 
hath a vertue of his signe or Planet. If 
any man drinke the iuyce of it, it maketh 
him to do often the act of generation: And 
if any man beare the roote thereof, it helpeth 
the griefe of the eies: and if he beare 
it with him before hee haue any griefe, 
there shall come to him no griefe of his 
eyes. It helpeth them also that be vexed 
with the phrensie, if they beare it with 
them in the breast. 
 
It helpeth them also that are diseased 
with an impostume in the lungs, and maketh 
them to haue a good breath, and it auaileth 
also to the flixe of melancholious 
blood. 
 
The third is the hearbe of the Moone, 
which is called Chynostates. The iuyce 
of it purgeth the paine of the stomach and 
breastplates: the vertue of it declareth 
that it is the hearbe of the Moone. 
[^f.B3v^] 
The floure of this hearbe purgeth great 
spleenes and healeth them, because this 
hearbe increaseth and decreaseth as doth 
the Moone. It is good against the sicknes 
of the eyes, and maketh a sharpe sight. It 
is good against the blood of the eyes. If 
thou put the roote of it breyed vpon y=e= eye, 
it will make the eye maruailous cleere, 
because the light of the eyes Propinquatum 
miston, is of the substance of the 
Moone. It is also good to them that haue 
an ill stomacke, of which cannot digest 
their meate, by drinking the iuyce thereof, 
moreouer it is good for them that haue y=e= 
swine pockes. 
 
The fourth bearbe is called Arnoglossa, 
plaintaine. The roote of this hearbe is 
maruellous good against the paine in the 
head, because the signe of the Ram is supposed 
to be the house of the planet Mars, 
which is the head of the whole world. It 
is good also against euill customs of a 
mans stones, and rottennesse or filthy 
biles, because his house is the signe Scorpio, 
and because a part of it holdeth Sparma, 
that is, the seed which cometh against 
the stones: whereof all liuing things bee 
[^f.B4r^] 
engendered and formed. 
 
Also the iuyce of it is good to them that 
be sicke of the perrillous Flixe, with excoration 
or raysing of the bowels, continual 
torments, and some blood issuing foorth, 
and more it purgeth them that do take & 
drinke thereof, from the sicknesse of the 
flixe of blood or emorhods, and of the disease 
of the stomacke. 
 
The fift is of the hearbe of the planete 
Mercurius, which is named Pentaphilon, 
in English Cinquefoile or the fiue 
leaued hearbe, of other Pantactuilus, 
of others Sepe declinans, of certaine Capedolo. 
The roote of this hearbe braied 
and made in a plaister, healeth wounds 
and hardnesse. 
 
Moreouer, it putteth away quickly the 
disease called the swines pockes, if the 
iuyce of it be drunken with water, It also 
healeth the passions or greefes of the 
breast, if the iuyce of it be drunken. It also 
putteth awap the toothach. And if the 
iuyce of it be holden in the mouth, it healeth 
the greefes of the mouth: and if a man 
beare it with him, it will be to him a help. 
[^f.B4v^] 
Moreouer if any man wil aske any thing 
of a king or prince, it giueth aboundance 
of eloquence if he haue it with him, and 
he shall obtaine the thing he desireth. It 
is also good to haue the iuyce of it, for the 
griefe of the stone, and the sicknes which 
letteth a man that he cannot pisse. 
 
The sixt, is the hearbe of the Planet 
Iubiter, and it is named Acharon of certaine 
Iusquianus, Henbane. The root of 
it put vpon botches healeth them, & keepeth 
the place from inflamation of blood. 
If any man shall beare it before the greef 
come vpon him, he shal neuer haue botch. 
 
The root of it also is profitable against 
the gout in the feet, when it is brayed and 
put vpon the place that suffreth the paine 
or grief. And it worketh by vertue of those 
signes which haue feet, and looke vpon the 
feet: and if the iuyce of it be drunken with 
hony, or with wine and hony sodden together, 
it is profitable against the griefes 
of the liuer, and all the passions thereof, 
because Iupiter ruleth the liuer. 
 
Likewise, it is profitable to them that 
would do often the act of generation, and 
[^f.B5r^] 
to them that desire to be loued of women 
if they beare it with them, for it maketh 
the bearers pleasant and delectable. 
 
The seuenth is the hearbe of the planet, 
Venus and is called Pisterion, of some 
Hierobotane, id est, sterbo columbaria & 
vrbena Veruin. 
 
The root of this herb put vpon the neck 
healeth the swine pockes, apostumes behinde 
the eares, and botches of the neck, 
and such as cannot keepe their water. 
It healeth cuts also, and swelling of the 
euill, or fundament, proceeding of an inflamation 
which groweth in the fundament, 
and the Emorhods. If the iuyce of 
it be drunke with hony and water sodden 
it dissolueth those things which are about 
the lungs and lights. It is also of great 
strength in veneriall pastimes. If any 
man put it in his house or vineyard, or in 
the ground, he shal haue great store of increase: 
Moreouer the root of it is good for 
all those which will plant vineyards or 
trees. If infants beere this hearbe, they 
shall be very apt to learne, and loue learning, 
and they shall be glad and ioyous. 
[^f.B5v^] 
Yet this is to be marked, that these herbs 
be gathered from the three and twentieth 
day of the Moone, vntil the thirtith day 
beginning the signe Mercurius by the 
space of a whole houre, and in gathering 
make mention of the passion or greefe, and 
the name of the thing, for the which thou 
doost gather it, and the selfe hearbe: notwithstanding, 
lay the hearb vpon wheat, 
or Barley, and vse it afterward vnto thy 
vses.

[}If thou wilt know whether thy wife be 
chaste or no.}] 
 
TAke the stone which is called Magnes 
in English the loade stone, it is of sad 
blew colour, and it is found in the sea of 
Inde, and sometime in the parts of Almaine, 
, in the prouince which is called 
East France. Lay this stone vnder 
the head of a wife, and if she be chast, shee 
will embrace her husband if shee bee not 
chast, she wil anon forth of her bed. Moreouer, 
if this stone be put brayed and scattered 
vpon coals, in foure corners of the 
house, they that be sleeping, shall flee the 
house and leaue all. 
 
[^f.B7r^] 
[}If thou wilt be made inuisible.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Ophethalmins, 
and wrap it in the leafe of the 
Laurell or Bay tree, and it is called, Lapis 
obtelmicus, whose colour is not named, 
for it is of many colours, and it is 
of such vertue, that it blindeth the sights 
of them that stand about. Constantinus 
carrying this in his hand, was made inuisible 
therewith. 
 
[}If thou wilt prouoke sorrow, feare, terrible 
fantasies and debate.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Oniz, 
whose colour is blacke, and that kinde is 
best that is full of blacke veines. It commeth 
from Inde vnto Araby: and if it 
be hanged vpon the necke or finger, it 
soone stirreth vp sorrow and heauinesse in 
a man, and also terrors and debate, and 
this hath bin proued by men of late time. 
 
[}If thou wilt burne any mans hand 
without fire.}] 
 
[^f.B7v^] 
TAke the stone which is called Fetipendamus, 
which is of yellow colour, 
and if it be hanged vpon the neck of any 
man it healeth Articum: also if this stone 
be griped straightly, it will burne the 
hand, and therefore it must bee touched 
lightly and gently. 
 
[}If thou wilt kindle the minde of any 
man to ioy and make his wit sharpe.}] 
 
TAke the stone which is called Sylonites, 
it groweth in y=e= bosome of a snaile 
of Inde, called Corcuses, and there is of 
diuers kindes of it, as white, redde, and 
purple colour. Other say, that it is greene, 
and found in the parts of Persia: and 
as olde Philosophers say, if it be tasted, it 
giueth knowledge of certaine thinges to 
come. If it be put vnderneath the tongue, 
especially in the first Moone, it hath a vertue 
onely for an houre. Therefore beeing 
in the tenth moone, hath this vertue 
in the first or tenth houre: but there is 
mouing in the order, because, when it is 
vnder the toong, if our thought bee of any 
[^f.B8r^] 
businesse, whether it ought to be or no: if 
it ought to bee, it is fixed stedfastly to the 
heart, so that it may not be plucked away: 
if not, the heart leapeth backe from it. Also 
Philosophers haue saide, that it healeth 
ptisicos, and weake men. 
 
[}If thou wilt that seething water come 
foorth anon after thou hast put in thy 
hand.}] 
 
TAke the stone which is called Topazion, 
for the Ile Topasys, or because it 
sheweth a similitude like gold, and there 
be two kindes of it: one is vtterly like 
gold, and this is more precious. The other 
kinde is of the colour of saffron, and 
of brighter colour then gold is, and this 
is more profitable. It hath beene prooued 
in our time, that if it be put into seething 
water, it maketh it to runne ouer: but if 
thou put thy hand in it, the water is 
quickly drawne out: and this there was 
one of our brethren than did it at Paris. 
It is good also against Emothoicam et 
Stimaticam, or lunatike passion or greefe. 
 
[^f.B8v^] 
[}If thou wilt plucke of the skin of thine, 
or another mans hand.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Medora, 
of the region Media in the which the 
people dwelling are called Medy. And 
there be two kinds therof, black & greene. 
It is said of old philosophers, and also of 
Philosophers of latter times, that if the 
blacke be broken, and resolued in hot water, 
if any man wash his hands therein, 
the skin of his hands shall be plucked off 
anone. Philosophers say also, that it is 
good against the gout, and blindnesse of 
the eyes, & it nourisheth hurt & weak eies. 
 
[}If thou wilt that a man suffer no paine 
nor be tormented.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Memphitis, 
of the citty Memphis: it is a stone 
of such vertue, as Aaron and Hermes say 
if it be drunken and mixed with water, 
and giuen to him to drinke, which should 
happen to be burned, or suffer any torments, 
that drinke induceth so great 
[^f.C1r^] 
vnablenesse to feele, that he that suffereth 
feeleth neither paine nor tormenting. 
 
[}If thou wilt make a fire continually vnable 
to be quenched or put out.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Abaston, 
and it is of the colour of yron, & there 
is found very much of it in Arabia. If 
that stone be kindled or inflamed, it may 
neuer be put out, or quenched, because it 
hath the nature of the first feathers of the 
Salamander, by reason of moystly fatnes 
which nourisheth the fire kindled in it. 
 
[}If thou wilt ouercome thine 
enemies.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Adamis, 
in English speech a Diamond, It is 
of a shining colour & very hard, insomuch 
that it cannot be broken but by the blood 
of a Goat, and it groweth in Arabia or in 
Cipres. And if it be bound to the left side 
it is good against enemies, madnes, wilde 
beasts, venimous beasts, and cruell men, 
and against chiding and brawling, and 
against venim, and inuasion of fantasies, 
[^f.C1v^] 
and some call it Diamas. 
 
[}If thou wilt eschew perils and terrible 
things, and haue a strong heart.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Agathes, 
and it is black, & hath white veines. 
There is another of the same kinde, like 
to white colour. And the third groweth 
in a certaine Ile, hauing blacke vaines 
and that maketh to ouercome perils and 
giueth strength to the heart maketh a 
man mighty pleasant, delectable and helpeth 
against aduersaries. 
 
[}If thou desire to obtaine any thing from 
any man.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Alectoria, 
and it is a stone of a cocke, and it is 
white as the Christall, and it is drawne 
out of the cocks gisar, or maw, after that 
he hath bin gelded more then foure yeeres 
and it is of the greatnesse of a beane. It 
maketh the belly pleasant and stedfast, 
and put vnder the tongue, it quencheth 
thirst. And this last hath beene prooued in 
[^f.C2r^] 
our time, and I perceiued it quickely. 
 
[}If thou wilt ouercome beasts, and interpret 
or expounde all dreames and 
prophesie of things to come.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Esmundus 
or Asmundus, it is of diuers colours, 
it putteth away poison, & maketh 
a man to ouercome his aduersaries, and 
the gift of prophesying, and the interpretation 
of all dreames, and making a man 
to vnderstand darke questions hard to be 
vnderstood or assoiled. 
 
[}If thou wilt haue good vnderstanding 
of things that may be felt, and that 
thou mayst not be made drunke.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Amaristus, 
it is of purple colour, and the best 
is found in Inde, and it is good against 
drunkennesse and giueth good vnderstanding 
in things that be vnderstood. 
 
[}If thou wilt ouercome thine enimies 
and fly debate.}] 
 
[^f.C2v^] 
Take the stone which is called Bexilus 
it is of pale colour and may be seene thorough 
as water, beare it about with thee, 
and thou shalt ouercome all debate, and 
shalt driue away the enemies, and maketh 
thy enemy meeke. It causeth a man 
to be well mannered, as Aaron saith, it 
giueth also good vnderstanding. 
 
[}If thou wilt foreiudge, or coniecture of 
things to come.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Celonites, 
it is purple and diuers other colours, 
and it is found in the head of the 
snaile. If any man will beare this stone 
vnder the tongue, he shall foreiudge and 
tell of things to come. But not withstanding 
it hath no vertue but shining. 
Prima cum fuerit, acceusa, & crescens monoytes 
in Vltima descendente. 
 
So meaneth Aaron, in the booke of vertues 
of hearbs & stones. 
 
[}If thou wilt pacifie tempests and goe ouer 
flouds.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Cora 
[^f.C3r^] 
some be red and some white. And it hath 
beene prooued that it stemmeth anon blood 
that putteth away the foolishnesse of him 
that beareth it, and giueth wisdome. And 
this hath beene proued of certaine men in 
our time: and it is good against tempests 
and perils of flouds. 
 
[}If thou wilt kindle fire.}] 
 
Take the Chrystall stone, and put it 
nigh vnder the circle of the Sunne, that 
is to say against Sunne, and put it nigh 
any thing that may bee burned, and incontiently 
the heat of the Sunne shining 
will set it a fire: and if it be drunke with 
Hony it increaseth milke. 
 
[}If thou wilt that the Sunne appeare of 
bloody colour.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Elitropia, 
it is greene like to the precious stone 
called the Cmeraud: & it is sprinkled 
with bloudy drops. The necramancers 
call it Gemmi babilonica, the precious 
stone of Babylon, by the proper name. 
[^f.C3v^] 
But if it be anointed with the iuyce of an 
hearbe of the same name, and be put in a 
vessel full of water, it maketh the Sunne 
to seem of bloody colour: as if the Ecclipse 
were seen. The cause of this is, for it maketh 
all the water to bubble vp vnto a litle 
cloude, which making the ayre thicke, 
hindereth the Sunne that she cannot bee 
seene but as it were red in a thicke color, 
a little after the cloude goeth away by 
dropping down like dew, as it were drops 
of raine. This also borne about a man, 
maketh a man of good fame, hole and of 
long life. It is said of old Philosophers, 
that a man annointed with an hearbe of 
this name, as we haue said before: excelleth 
with vertue, and Elitropia is found 
many times in Cipresse and Inde. 
 
[}If thou wilt make water cold that seetheth 
on the fire.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Epibretes, 
which put in water against the 
eye of the sun, putteth forth fiery beames 
of the Sun: and it is said of old and new 
philosophers, if it be put in seething water, 
[^f.C4r^] 
the bubbling vp or seething will soone 
cease, and a little after, it will waxe colde 
and it is a shining and ruddie stone. 
 
[}If thou wilt eschew illusions & fantasies 
and ouercome all causes or matters.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Calcedonius, 
and it is of pale browne colour 
and somewhat darke: if this bee pierced 
and hanged about the neck, with the stone 
which is called Sinerip: it is good against 
all fantasticall illusions, and it maketh 
to ouercome al causes or matters in iuice, 
and keepeth the body against thy aduersaries. 
 
[}If thou wilt be pleasant.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Celidonius, 
of which there is some that is 
blacke and some somewhat red, and it is 
drawn out of the bellies of swallows. If 
that which is somwhat red be wrapped in 
a linnen cloth, or in a calues hide, & borne 
vnder the left arme hole, is good against 
madnesse, and old sicknesses and diseases, 
and the sleeping or forgetting malladies, 
[^f.C4v^] 
and Contra epidimiam, which is a scab 
that runneth through the whole bodie. 
 
Euax saith, that this stone maketh a 
man eloquent, acceptable and pleasant. 
The blacke stone is good against wilde 
beasts, and wrath, and bringeth the businesse 
begun to an end. And if it be wrapped 
in the leaues of Celidon, it is said 
that it maketh the sight dull: and they 
should bee drawne out in the moneth of 
August, and two stones are found oftentimes 
in one swallow. 
 
[}If thou wilt be victorious gainst thy 
aduersaies.}] 
 
TAke the stone which is called Bagates, 
and it is of diues colours. The 
ancient Philosophers say, that it hath 
beene prooued in the prince Alcibes, which 
how long he did beare it, he had alwayes 
victory: & it is a stone of diuers colours, 
like the skin of a kid. 
 
[}If thou wilt know any thing to come.}] 
 
TAke the stone which is called Bena, 
which is like a Beasts tooth, and put 
[^f.C5r^] 
it vnder thy tongue. And as Aaron & the 
old Philosophers say, as long as thou 
doest hold it thou mayest coniecture and 
tell of things to come and thou shalt not 
erre in any wise for iudging. 
 
[}If thou wilt that thy garment cannot be 
burned.}] 
 
TAke the stone which is called Histmos, 
which as Isidorus saith is like 
to Saffron, and it is found in a part of 
Spaine This stone bloweth like a paire 
of bellowes, by reason of the windinesse 
in it, It is found night the Gades of Hercules, 
that is two Iles, by the further 
parts of Spaine beyond Garnade, and if 
this stone be set in a garment, it cannot 
be burned in any wise, but shineth like 
fire. And some men affirme that the 
white carbuncle stone, is of this kinde. 
 
[}If thou wilt haue fauour or honour.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Tabrices, 
and it is like the Christall stone. The ancient 
Philosophers, as Euax and Aaron 
say of it, that it giueth eloquence, fauour, 
[^f.C5v^] 
and honour, and it is said moreouer, that 
it healeth euery dropsie. 
 
[}If thou wilt driue away fantasies and 
foolishnesse.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Chrysolitus, 
and it is of the same vertue with 
Attemicus, as Aron and Euax say, in the 
booke of the natures of hearbs and stones 
This stone set in gold, and borne, driueth 
away foolishnesse, and expelleth fantasies. 
It is affirmed to giue wisedome, and it is 
good against feare. 
 
[}If thou wilt iudge the opinions and 
thoughts of others.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Garatides, 
it is of blacke colour: Let one hold 
it in his mouth, and it maketh him that 
beareth it, merry and in fauour, and well 
esteemed with all men. 
 
[}If thou wilt haue victory and amity.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Nichomay, 
and it is the same that is called Alabaster, 
[^f.C6r^] 
and it is a kind of marble, and 
it is white and shinings, and ointments 
are made therof to y=e= burying of the dead. 
 
[}If thou wilt that a man sleeping tel thee 
what he hath done.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Quirim 
this stone is found in the neast of the 
Lapwing or blacke plouer. 
 
[}If thou wilt obtaine any thing of a man.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Radianus, 
and it is blacke, shining through 
which when the head of a cocke is giuen 
to Emotes or Pismires to eat, it is found 
a long time after, in the head of the cock. 
And the same stone is also called Tonatides. 
 
[}If thou wilt make that neither dogs, nor 
hunters may hurt any beast which 
they hunt.}] 
 
Put before them the stone which is 
called Luperius, and it wil runne soone to 
the stone. 
[^f.C6v^] 
This stone is found in Lybia, & al beasts 
run to it as to their defender. It letteth 
that neither dogs nor hunters may hurt 
them. 
 
[}If thou wilt burne any mans hand without 
fire.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Vnces, 
which we called before princi penapti 
which is fire, and it is as fire. If any man 
straine hard this stone, it burneth soone 
his hand, like as if it were burned with 
a materiall fire, which is a maruelous 
thing. 
 
[}If thou wilt eure melancholly, or a feuer 
quartaine in any man.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Lapis 
lazuly. It is like to the colour of the heauen: 
and there is within it little bodies 
of gold: and it is sure and prooued that it 
cureth melancholy and the feuer quartan. 
 
[}If thou wilt make any mans wit sharpe 
and quick, & augment his riches, and 
also prophesie things to come.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Smaragdus, 
[^f.C7r^] 
in English an Emeraud: and it 
is very cleare, shining through and plain 
but that of yellow colour is better. It is 
taken out of the neasts of gripes or Griffons, 
it doth both comfort and saue, and 
being borne it maketh a man to vnderstand 
well; and giueth to him a good memory, 
augmenteth the riches of him that 
beareth it, and if any man shal hold it vnder 
his tongue, he shall prophesie anon. 
 
[}If thou wilt make a rainbow to appear.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Iris, 
and it is white like to a Christall, foure-square 
or hauing hornes, if this stone be 
put in the beames of the sunne, by turning 
backe it maketh a rainbow soone to 
appeare in the wall. 
 
[}If thou wilt make a stone that will neuer 
be made hot.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Gallasia 
it hath the figure of the haile, and the 
colour and hardnesse of the diamond. If 
this stone be put in a very great fire it 
[^f.C7v^] 
will neuer be hot. And the cause is, for it 
hath the holes so straight together, that 
the heat may not enter into the body of 
the stone. Also Aaron and Euax say, that 
this stone borne, mitigateth wrath, lecherie 
and other hot passions. 
 
[}If thou wilt know whether thy wife lyerh 
with any other married man.}] 
 
Take the stone called Galeritis, which 
is the same that is called Catabres, and 
it is found in Lybia and Britannia, the 
most noble Isle of he world, wherein is 
contained both countries, England and 
Scotland. It is of double colour blacke, 
and of the colour of saffron, and it is found 
gray coleured, turning to palenesse. It 
healeth the dropsie, and it bindeth the bellies 
that are loose. And as Auicenna saith, 
That if the stone be broken and washed 
or be giuen to a woman to be washed, if 
she be not a virgin, she will shed her water, 
if she be a virgin, then the contrary. 
 
[}If thou wilt ouercome thine 
enemies.}] 
 
[^f.C8r^] 
Take the stone which is called Draconites, 
from the dragons head. And if 
the stone bee drawne out from him aliue 
it is good against all poysons, and he that 
beareth it in his left arme, shall ouercome 
all his enemies. 
 
[}If thou wilt engender loue betweene any 
two.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Echites, 
and it is called of some Aquileus, because 
the Eagles put these in their nests. 
It is of purple color, and it is found nigh 
the bankes of the Ocean sea and somtime 
in Persia, and it containeth alwaies another 
stone in it which soundeth in it, whe~ 
it is named. It is said of ancient Philosophers, 
that this stone hanged vpon the 
left shoulder, gathereth loue betweene 
the husband and the wife. It is profitable 
to women great with childe, it letteth 
vntimely birth, it mitigateth the perill 
of making afraid, and it is said to be good 
to them that haue the fallingsicknes. And 
as the men of Chaldee say and affirme 
that if there be any poyson in thy meate, 
[^f.C8v^] 
if the aforesaid stone be put in, it letteth 
that meat may be swallowed downe: and 
if it be taken out, the meate is soone swallowed 
downe, and I did see that this laste 
was examined sensible of one of our brethren. 
 
[}If thon wilt make a man sure.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Tepistites. 
It is found in the sea, it is shining 
and ruddie: and it is said in the Booke 
of Alchorath, that if it be borne before the 
hearth, it maketh a man sure, and refraineth 
and mitigateth all seditions, and discords. 
It is said also that it mitigateth 
the flyes with long hinder legs, which 
burneth corne with touching of it and deuoureth 
the residue, foules cloudes, haile, 
and such as haue power of the fruits of 
the earth. And it hath beene prooued of 
philosophers of late time, and of certaine 
of our brethren that it being put against 
the Beame of the Sunne putteth foorth 
fiery beames. Also if this stone be put in 
seething water, the seething wil soon cease 
and the water will be cold a little after. 
 
[^f.D1r^] 
[}If thou wilt that strangers 
walke sure.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Hiacinthus, 
in English a Iacinct, it is of many 
colours. The green is best, and it hath 
redde veines, and should be set in siluer: 
It is said in certaine Lectures, that there 
is two kinds of it, of the water, and of the 
Saphire. The Iacinct of the water is yellow 
& white. The Iacinct of the Saphires 
is very shining yellow, hauing no watrishnes 
& this is better, and it is written 
of this in lectures of philosophers, that it 
being borne on the finger or necke, maketh 
strangers sure and acceptable, to 
their ghests. And it prouoketh sleepe for 
the coldnesse of it, and the Iacinct of Saphire 
hath properly this. 
 
[}If thou wilt be saued from diuers chances 
and pestilent bits.}] 
 
Take the stone which is called Orithes, 
of which there be three kinds, one 
[^f.D1v^] 
black, another greene, and the third, of the 
which one part is rough, & the other plain, 
and the colour of it is like the colour of a 
plate of iron, but the greene hath white 
spots. This stone borne, preserueth from 
diuers chances, and perils of death. 
 
[}If thou wilt make Peace.}] 
 
TAke the stone which is called Saphire, 
which commeth from the East 
into India and that of yellow colour is 
the best, which is not very bright, it makth 
peace and concord, also it makes the 
mind pure and deuout to God: further, is 
strengtheneth the minde in good things, 
and keepeth a man from too much inward 
heate. 
 
[}If thou wilt cure a virgin.}] 
 
TAke y=e= stone which is called Saunus 
from the Ile Sauna. It doth make 
firme or consolidate the minde of the bearer 
of it: and being bound to the hand of 
a woman trauelling with childe, it hindereth 
the birth, and keepeth it still in the 
wombe. Therefore in any such occasion it 
[^f.D2r^] 
is forbidden, that a woman in that state 
should not touch this stone. 
 
THou shalt finde many other like 
things in the booke of Mines, of Aaron 
and Euax. 
 
The manner of doing things, consisteth 
in this, that the bearer of any of 
these things, be a cleane person, but especially 
in his bodie. 
 
[^f.D2v^] 
[}Explicit.}] 
 
ISidorus seemeth to say, that Licania 
hath in the head a stone of most noble 
vertue, and is of white colour, which 
brayed, giuen to them that haue the 
stranguilon, to drinke, it loseth perfectly 
the vrine and shortly healeth, it putteth 
away the feuer quartane. Also it taketh 
away a white spot or pearle in the 
eye. Also if a woman with child beare it 
on her, she looseth not her birth: moreouer 
the flesh of them sodden and eaten 
is good for them that haue an exulceration 
or sore in the lungs, with a consumption 
of all the body, and spitting of 
blood. Also the powder of the beasts, 
with rinde or barke of trees, and some 
graines of Pepper, is profitable against 
the Emerodes and growing out of flesh 
about the buttockes. Likewise they being 
raw, brayed with rindes of barke of 
trees, breake ripe impostumes. 
 
[^f.D3r^] 
[}The third Booke of Albertus 
Magnus, of the vertues 
of certaine Beasts.}] 
 
FOrasmuch as it hath beene 
spoken in the booke before of 
certaine effects, caused by the 
vertue of certaine stones, 
and of their merueilous vertue or operation: 
now we will speake in this Chapter 
of certaine beasts. 
 
[^A list in two columns, the columns are here represented in tab-delimited form.^] 
Aquila 	An Eagle 
Casso 
Bubo 	A shrike Owle 
Hircus 	A goat Bucke 
Camelus 	A Camel 
Lepus	A Hare. 
Expetiolus 
Leo 	A Lion 
Foca 	A Porpaise 
Anguilla 	An Eele 
[^f.D3v^] 
Mustela 	A wesel 
Vpupa 	A Lapwing or plouer. 
Pellicanus 	A Pellican 
Cornus 	A Crow 
Milnus 	A kite or gleid 
Turtur 	A Turtle 
Talpa 	A Mole 
Merula 	A black mack or owsel. 
[^End of the list.^] 
 
AQuila, the Eagle is a bird very well 
knowne of the men of Chaldee, it is 
called Vorax, and of the Greeks Rimbicus. 
Aaron and Euax say, that it hath a 
marueilous nature or vertue. For if the 
braine of it bee turned into powder, and 
mixed with the iuyce of Hemlocke, they 
that eat of if, shall take themselues by the 
haire, and shall not leaue their hold, so 
long as they beare that they haue receiued. 
The cause of this effect is, for that the 
braine is very colde, insomuch that it engendreth 
a fantasticall vertue, shutting 
the pores by smoake. 
 
CAsso is a beast that is knowne very 
well, It is called Rapa amongst the 
Chaldees, and of the Grecians Orgalo. 
[^f. D4r^] 
Aron saith of this. If the feet of it be born 
of any man, he shall neuer be vexed, but 
he shall desire alwaies to go forth. Also he 
that beareth the feet of it, shall alwayes ouercome, 
and shall be feared of his enemies. 
And he saith that his right eie wrapped 
in a wolues skin, maketh a man pleasant, 
acceptable and gentle. And if meate 
be made of the aforesaid things, or powder 
giuen to any man in meat, the giuer 
shall be greatly loued of him that receiueth 
it. This last was proued in our time. 
 
BVbo, a shrike Owle, is a Bird very 
wel known, which is called Magis of 
the Chaldees, Hisopus of the greeks, there 
be maruellous vertues of this foule. For 
if the heart and right foot of it, be put vpon 
a man sleeping, he will tell thee whatsoeuer 
thou shalt aske of him. And this 
hath been proued of late time among our 
brethren. And if any man put this vnder 
his arme hole, no Dog will barke at him, 
but keepe silence. And if these things aforesaid, 
ioyned together with a wing, if 
it be hanged vp to a tree, birds will gather 
together to that tree. 
 
[^f.D4v^] 
HIrcus, the Goat bucke is a beast well 
enough known, it is called of the 
Chaldees Erbichi, of the Greeks Massia. 
If the blood of it be taken warme with 
vineger and the iuyce of Fennill, and sodden 
together with a glasse, it maketh the 
glasse soft as dowe, and it may be cast against 
a wall, and not broken: And if the 
aforesaid confection be put in a vessel, and 
the face of any man be anointed therewith, 
marueilous & horrible things shall 
appeare, and it shall seeme to him that he 
must die: And if the aforesaid thing bee 
put in the fire, and there be any man that 
hath the falling sicknesse, by putting to 
the loadstone, he falleth suddenly to the 
ground as dead, and if the water of Eeles 
be giuen to him to drinke, he shall be cured 
quickely. 
 
CAmelus, the Camell is a beast 
known, well enough. It is called of 
the Chaldees Ciboi, of the greeks Iphim. 
If the blood of it be but in the skin of the 
beast called Stellio, and then set on any 
mans head, which is like a Lizard, hauing 
[^f.D5r^] 
on his backe spots like stars, it shall seeme 
that he is a Giant, and that his head is in 
heauen. And it is said in the booke of Alchorath, 
of Mercurie, that if a lanterne anointed 
with the blood of it, be lighted, it 
shall seem that men standing about, haue 
Camels heads, so that there bee no outward 
light of another candle. 
 
LEpus, the Hare is a beast very much 
known, of the Chaldees it is called 
Veterillium, and of the Greeks Guolosa, 
the vertue of it is shewed to be maruellous, 
for Euax & Aaron said, that the feet 
of it ioined with a stone, or with the head 
of a blacke Owsel, moueth a man to hardinesse, 
so that he feare not death. 
 
And if it be bound to his left arme, he 
may so whither he will & he shal returne 
safe without perill. And if it be giuen to a 
dog to eat, with the heart of a Wesell, 
from thenceforth shall he not cry out although 
he should be killed. 
 
EXperiolus, is a beast well enough 
knowne, if the cloue of it bee burned 
and consolidated, and bee giuen in meate 
[^f.D5v^] 
to any horse, he wil not eat for the space of 
three dayes: and if the aforesaid thing be 
put to a litle turpentine it wil be cleare, & 
secondly, it shall be made as a cloude in 
blood, and if it be cast into a little water a 
while, an horrible thunder shall be made. 
 
LEo, a Lyon is a beast well knowne, 
he is called of the Chaldees, Balamus 
of the Greeks, Beruth. If thongs of leather 
be made of the skin of him, & a man 
gird himselfe withall, hee neede not feare 
his enemies: and if any man will eate of 
the flesh of him, and drinke his water for 
three dayes he shal be cured from the feauer 
quartan: and if any part of his eyes 
be put vnder a mans arme hole, all beasts 
shall fly away, bowing down their heads 
to their bellies. 
 
FOca, a Porpaise is a fish wel known, 
of y=e= Chaldees it is called Daulumber 
of the Grecians Labor, this fish is of diuers 
natures. If the tung of it be taken & 
put with a little of the heart of it in water, 
for a surety fishes wil gather there together. 
And if thou wilt beare it vnder thy 
[^f.D6r^] 
arme hole, no man shall be able to get victory 
against thee, for thou shalt haue a 
gentle and pleasant iudge. 
 
ANguilla, an Eele, it is a fish sufficiently 
knowne. The vertues of it is 
maruellous, as Euax and Aaron say: for 
if it die for fault of water, the heart remaining 
hole, and strong vineger taken and 
mixed with the blood of the foule, called 
in Latin Vultur, which some call in English 
a Gripe, and some a Rauen, and put 
vnder dung in any place, they shall all 
how many soeuer they be, recouer their 
life, as they had before. And if the worme 
of this Eele be drawen out, and put in 
the aforesaid confection the space of one 
moneth, the worme shall be changed into 
a very blacke Eele, of which, if any man 
eate he shall die. 
 
MVstella, the Wesell, is a beast sufficiently 
known. If the hart of this 
beast be eaten yet quaking, it maketh a 
man to know things to come, and if any 
dog eat of the heart with the eyes and 
tongue of it hee shall soone loose his voice. 
 
[^f.D6v^] 
VPupa, the Lapwing or black plouer, 
is a birde sufficiently knowne of the 
Chaldees, it is called Bordicta, of y=e= greeks 
Ison: The eyes of it borne, make a man 
grosse or great, & if the eyes of it be borne 
before a mans breast, all his enemies shal 
be pacified: and if thou shalt haue the head 
of it in thy purse, thou canst not be deceiued 
of any merchant. This hath bin proued 
of our brethren. 
 
PEllicanus, the Pellican is a bird well 
knowne, It is called of the Chaldees 
Voltri, and of the Greeks Iphalari. The 
vertue of it is maruellous. If yong birds 
be killed & their heart be not broken, and 
a part of her blood be taken & put warme 
in the mouth of the young birds they will 
againe soone receiue life as before. If it be 
hanged vp to the necke of any bird, it shal 
flie alwayes, vntil it fall dead. And if the 
right foot of if be put vnder any hot thing 
after three moneths somewhat shalbe engendred 
quicke, and shal mooue it selfe of 
the humor and heat, which the bird hath. 
And Hermes in the book of Alchorath, & 
Plinius doth witnesse this. 
 
[^f.D7r^] 
COrnus, called of some a Rauen, and 
of others a Crow, the vertue of this 
foule is maruellous, as Euax and Aaron 
rehearse. If her egges be sodden, and put 
againe into the nest, the Rauen goeth 
soone to the red sea, in a certain Ile, where 
Aldoricus or Alodrius is buried, and shee 
bringeth a stone wherewith she toucheth 
her egges, and the egges be as rawe as 
they were before: It is a maruellous 
thing to stirre vp sodden egges. If this 
stone be put in a ring, and the leafe of the 
Lawrell tree vnder it, and if a man bee 
bound in chaines, or a doore shut, be touched 
therewith, he that is bound shall bee 
loosed, and the doore shall be opened: and 
if this stone be put in a mans mouth, it 
giueth him vnderstanding of all birdes. 
The stone is India, because it is found 
in India, as some men say, and some say 
in the red sea. It is of diuers colours, and 
maketh a man to forget all wrath,as we 
haue said aboue in the same stone. 
 
MIlnus, a Kite or Gleide, is a birde 
common amongst vs, of y=e= Chaldees 
[^p.D7v^] 
it is called Bisicus, of the greeks Melos. If 
the head of it be taken, and borne before 
a mans breast, it giueth to him loue and 
fauour of all men and women. 
 
If it be hanged to the necke of a hen, 
she will neuer cease to run, vntill it be put 
away: and if a cocks combe be anointed 
with the blood of it, hee will crowe from 
thenceforth. There is a certaine stone 
found in the knees of this bird, if it be looked 
craftily, which if it be put in the meat 
of two enemies, they shalbe made friends 
and there shal be made very great friendship 
among them. 
 
TVrtur, a Turtle, is a birde very well 
knowne, it is called Merlon, of the 
Chaldees, of the Greekes Pilax. If the 
heart of this foule be borne in a Wolues 
skin, he that beareth it, shal neuer hane an 
appetite to commit lechery from henceforth. 
If the heart of it be burned, and put 
aboue the egges of any foul, there can neuer 
yong birds be engendred of them from 
thenceforth: and if the feet of this foule be 
hanged to a tree, it shall not beare from 
thenceforth. 
 
[^f.D8r^] 
And if an hairy place, or an horse be anointed 
with the blood of it, and with water 
wherin a Mole was sodden, the black 
haires will fall of. 
 
TAlpa, a Mole, is a beast very well 
knowne. The vertue of this beast is 
maruellous, as it is rehearsed of Philosophers. 
If the foot of it be wrapped in the 
leafe of a Lawrell tree, and bee put in the 
mouth of an horse, hee will flie for feare: 
And if it be put in the nest of any foule, 
there shall neuer come foorth young birds 
of these egges: And if thou wilt driue away 
Moles, put it in a pot, & quicke brimstone 
kindled, all the other Moles shall 
come together there: & the water of that 
decoction maketh a blacke horse white. 
 
MErula, a blacke macke or Owsel, is 
a foule very well knowne, and the 
vertue of it is maruellous. For if the feathers 
of the right wing of it be hanged vp 
in the midst of an house, with a redde 
leafe, which is neuer occupied, no man 
shall be able to sleepe in that house, vntill 
it be put away. Moreover if the heart of it 
[^f.D8v^] 
be put vnder the head of a man sleeping, 
if you aske him any thing, he shall tell all 
he hath done with a high voyce. 
 
The manner of doing these aforesaid 
things, that the effect may bee good and 
profitable, is that it be done vnder a fauourable 
planet, as Iupiter and Venus, 
as this is in their dayes and houres. If 
any man therefore will doe these things 
truely, without doubt, he shall find truth, 
and very great effect and vertue, in the aforesaide 
things as I haue prooued and 
seene oftentimes together, with our brethren 
in our time: therfore let a man consider 
here, which shall find plenty of those 
aforesaid things, that he possesseth a Lord 
ship of vertues. For if they hane done in 
their contraries, as a good effect in a malicious 
signe, his vertue and effect should be 
hindred by his contrary, & therby good and 
true things growe to be despised. We see 
by daily experience, very many people 
are deceiued in true things, which if they 
had knowne, and kept the qualities of 
signes, or the right measure of times and 
seasons, they should haue gained their wil 
[^f.E1r^] 
and effect, in the aforesaid things. 
 
Isidorus seemeth to say, that the ashes 
of a great frog, tyed to a womans girdle, 
restraineth the comming of a womans 
naturall purgation. 
 
And in probation, if it be bound about 
a hennes necke, no blood shall come out of 
her, or of any other beast. 
 
Also if it be tempred with water, and 
the head or any other place be annointed 
therewith, here will neuer grow. 
 
If any man beare a dogs heart on his 
left side, all dogs shal hold their peace, and 
not barke at him. 
 
If any man will bind the right eye 
of a Woolfe on his right sleeue, neither 
men nor dogs may hurt him.
