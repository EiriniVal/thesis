[^Extract 1, ff. A4r-D8r^] 
 
[^f.A4r^] 
[}Abies.}] 
 
ABies is called in 
greke Elate, in english 
a firre tree, in 
duch, Ein dannen,

naturally and 
in certeyne gardines pla~ted and set

in englishe Sothernwod, in duche Affrush, 
in frenche Auronne. There are two kyndes 
of Sothernwod, the male and the female. 
The male groweth plentuously in gardines 
in Englande, but the female dyd I neuer see 
growing in Englande, it is founde 
in Italy in plentie inough. Sothernwod is 
hote and dry in the thirde degree. 
 
[}Absinthium.}] 
 
Absinthium is called in greke. Apsinthion, 
in englishe wormwod, in Duche wermout, 
in french, Absince or Aluyne. There 
are three kyndes of wormwod, beside the 
commune wormwod, wormwod pontike, 
called in latin Absinthium ponticum, in englishe 
[^f.A4v^] 
maye be also called wormwod gentle, 
it is called of Mesue and of the Potecaries 
of Germany Absinthium romanum 
the Coloners call it graue crut, the Freses 
call it wylde rosmary. The beste kynde of 
thys wormwode gentle or pontike that I 
haue sene came from Rome, an other kynde 
of the same is to be had in Anwerp and thorowe 
al Germany in plentie. The seconde 
kynde is called in latin Absin-thium marinum 
and Seryphum, it groweth co~monly

certeyne tymes to come, it is plentuous in 
Northumberlande by holy Ilande, and in 
Northfolke beside Lin, at Barrowe in Brabant, 
and at Norden in est freslande. Some 
take thys herbe agaynst the trueth for pontike 
wormwod. The thirde kynde is called 
in latin Absinthium santonicum, I neuer se 
the herbe but ones, it maye be called in englishe 
frenche wormwod. Oure commune 
wormwod is called in latine Absinthium 
rusticum. And here is to be marked that 
they are farre deceiued that vse this for po~tike 
wormwod. I report me to Galene (xi. 
Methodi medendi) whether it be so or no. 
Pontike wormwod, is hote in the fyrste degree 
and dry in the thirde. Sea wormwod 
is hote in the seconde degree and dry in the 
[^f.A5r^] 
fyrste, frenche wormwod is weaker then 
Sea wormwod is. 
 
[}Acanthium.}] 
 
Acanthium is called in greke Acanthion, 
it is named of some herbaries carduus asininus, 
I haue not hearde the name of it in 
englishe, but I thynke it maye be called in 
englishe otethistle, because the seedes are 
lyke vnto rough otes, or gum thistle, or cotten 
thistle, because it is gummy and the leaues 
haue in the~ a thynge lyke cotten, which 
appeareth when they are broke~. It groweth 
in gardines in Bonony, I haue also sene it 
in England in gardines, but neuer a brode. 
The herbe is of an hote & a subtile nature. 
 
[}Acanthus.}]

in gardines and in the greatest plentie that 
I euer sawe it, I did see it in my Lorde Protectours 
graces gardine at Syon, some erre 
sore whiche abuse for thys herbe berefote. 
The rote of bra~keursine drieth and cutteth 
humours lyghtly, and is of subtile partes. 
the leaues haue power metely to dryue humours 
to their places. 
 
[}Aconitum.}] 
 
[^f.A5v^] 
There are .ij. kindes of the berbe called

in a wodde besyde Morpeth 
called Cottingwod. It hath foure leaues 
lyke vnto great pla~taine, & in the ouermost 
top a litle blacke bery lyke a blacke morbery,

opening, but gladen is colde, vnsauery and 
astringent. I thynke that the great Galanga
