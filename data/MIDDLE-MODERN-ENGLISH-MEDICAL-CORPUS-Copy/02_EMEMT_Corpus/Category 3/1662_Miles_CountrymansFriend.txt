[}Here is a rare way to prevent any manner of sickness 
whatsoever.}] 
 
TAke milk new from the Cow, 
about the quantity of a halfe 
pint porringer full; and if it 
be not warm enough of it self, 
set it a little while upon some 
warm embers, and then you 
must have the quantity of halfe a pennyworth 
of Saffron, tyed up in a little holland rag, and 
that end of the rag as the Saffron lieth in, dip 
it into the milk, and squeez the end of the 
rag that it may drop into the milk, so dip the 
Saffron rag into it six or seven times, one after 
another; every time you squeez the rag, you 
must do it with your thumb and fore-finger, 
and when you have so done, lay your Saffron 
[^f.A4v^] 
rag aside, and put a spoonful of life-hony into 
it, and stir it with a spoon, and when your honey 
is dissolved, let the party that is ill drink 
it up, and this take when they find themselves 
first amiss; it prevents almost any desease and 
drives away evil humours from the heart and 
is a rare defensiive, it prevents either Pox or 
Plagne, or any other cruel diseases; taking this 
potion but three mornings, and three evenings.

YOu that are troubled with convulsion fits, 
observe this rule; that it is the best time 
at the new of the Moon, or after the full, to 
begin to take any thing against the convulsion 
fits, take your Elethergie of gold as much at 
a time as will lie on a groat; after you have 
made it into a powder, and put it into your 
broath, into any manner of broath, or milk, 
or posset-drink; always when you go to 
meals, or to your diet; And if the the party

BEgin to take this, which I shall prescribe 
here for the Falling-sickness, much about 
[^f.A5r^] 
the same time, as is above mentioned concerning 
the convulsion fits; Let the party that is 
afflicted, have a pye, and three young Ravens 
baked in it, or a pye with three young Jeas 
baked in it; and let the party so afflicted, eat 
of it three times a day, a little quantity at a 
time: take a handful of Sage, red Sage, and a 
quart of white Wine; if you cannot have it, 
take a quart of fair spring water, and boyl the 
Sage in it very gently, until it be boyled half 
away; Then take it off, and set it a cooling, 
and when it is cold, put it into a glass, and if 
you can have it, put to it two grains of the 
Countess of Kents powder, & that you may have 
at the Apothecaries; and when you go to use

[}A rare and easie way to cure corns in the feet.}] 
 
IN the first place soak your corns in warm 
water, that will soften them, that you 
may cut them with ease, spread a plaister of 
Flossunguentorum on a little thin bit of lambs 
leather, And so many corns as you have, make 
so many little plaisters to cover the places 
where the corns are; the plaisters will stick salt, 
and in one day it will soften them, that you 
[^f.A5v^] 
may cut them at your ease, then you must have 
a little unslact Lime, and the best crown soap 
mixt together; a little quantity of each will 
serve the turn; then lay a little of this on each 
corn that is ready cut, and open a Raisin of the 
Sun, to lay over each place; where you have 
laid your soap and Lime, then wrap a linnen 
cloath about your foot, and make it fast; and

oyl, and Linseed oyle, and put them together, 
then take a peny worth of red lead and 
a peny worth of white Lead, and a peny worth 
of soft sealing wax, and a peny worth of verdigrease, 
put these with the other oyles into a

a little before you set it to the fire, then 
you should have a spotellet; it is at one end like 
a spad; then your pot of salve being set to 
the fire, you must stir it constantly; it will 
change of several colours as it stands against the 
fire; but when you perceive black spots arise 
in your salve; then it begins to be enough, 
[^f.A6r^] 
stir constantly, and when it is black all over, and 
riseth all frothy, it is enough, then you must 
have a little bole or bason almost full of fair 
cold water, to set the bottome of your salve 
pot into; this is to cool the heat of the salve, 
by setting the pot into the water, and still you 
must keep it stirring, until it be cold; then it 
is ready for your use. You may spread this 
salve upon dry oaken leaves, or Primrose 
leaves, or fine holland rags, or fine writing paper; 
and if the sore be very broad, or long, 
you may spread it on London brown paper, 
and apply it to the sore. There was of this 
salve sent to the Hospital, and it cured such 
sores that the Cyhrurgeons did admire at the 
vertue of it, & proffered many peices of gold for 
the receipt of it; But the authour of this book 
obtained the art in making this salve, by keeping 
a gentleman company, that used much to 
frequent the gentlemans house where this salve 
was made, this hath cured sore legs that should 
have been cut off. Probatum est.

company with any foul or unclean person; go 
this way to work, first, either to help your selfe, 
or your friend, Take a dram of Pulvus-sanctus,

stir it about with a knife; and then drink it 
up, and then take good store of posset drink 
after, that it may cause the purge to work lustily; 
you must begin alwayes to take a purge in 
a morning fasting, but if you are of a strong 
constution, I would wish you to take a dram 
of Extractum rudi, and make it into four or 
five little pils, and drink either posset-drink, 
or strong Ale, or Beer to cause it to work, then 
after it hath worked well, take some warm

then take a thin cloath, and strain

a little close jug bottle, and put to it two ounces 
of the best hard Sugar, and let the Sugar 
dissolve in it, and when you go to use it, shake 
it together, and the quantity that you must 
take is as followes; if the day be very hot 
take a spoonful at a time often in the day time, 
or otherwise three times a day; The Author

or if you be so well provided, instead of washing 
it with water, wash it with the juice of 
Lemond, and you must wash it in a little white 
Gally pot, and let it stand in the same pot covered 
with a white paper; so you may take it 
three times a day, at the end of a knife point, 
an indifferent quantity at a time, or you may 
take it in little pils, rolled in Sugar, upon a 
trencher; and if you will you may add to it 
Sanguis draconis, or the blood of a Dragon 
beat to powder, and so you may mix it with 
the pils, and these pils worketh a gallant effect

is, the female sex delighteth in clean linnen.
