[}THE 
POORE MANS 
PLASTER-BOX, 
Furnished with divers excellent Remedies, 
for suddaine mischances, and usuall infirmities 
which happen to Men, Women, and 
Children in this Age.}] 
 
[}For a small wound or hurt with Sword, Knife, Axe, 
or any other edge Toole.}] 
 
MY full intent and desire is to give 
direction to the poore and plaine 
people, such as cannot (for their 
remote living) get a Chirurgion, 
or else (dwelling where they may 
be had) want meanes to pay 
them for their paines; such people 
when they have any wound 
that is superficiall, (I meane 
which is not very deepe) whether it be done with Sword, 
Knife, Axe, Sithe, or Sickle,, it makes no matter. Let them 
ioyne the lippes of the wound together so even as they can, 
and beate the white of an Egge with a little salt, and apply 
it with fine Flax or Lint made of an old cleane cloath, and 
[^p.2^] 
roule it so neately as you can. The next day open it and 
apply one of those wound-salves mentioned in this Booke, 
or else you may take sallet Oyle and a little Suggar, and 
dip Lint therein, and apply it. 
 
Or take Mouse-eare and pouder it, and strew it in a greene 
wound, and it will heale it. 
 
Also wilde Tansie chopt small, one handfull, Egs two; 
mingle them and fry them with sweet butter well washed 
from the salt, then strayne them, and it will be a good salve 
or greene wounds. 
 
Or take Horse-taile or shave grasse and pouder it, and it 
will ioyne greene wounds and heale them. 
 
Brugle or Prunel strained and laid on a wound both heale 
it. 
Or Uervaine stamped with Honny and laid on as a plaster, 
healeth a wound or old soare in short time. 
 
Comfry is a hearbe knowne to most people, take the 
leaves thereof and bruise them, and lay them on the wound 
and it will heale it. It is of such vertue that if the leaves 
be boyled in white wine and water, or water alone, (for 
neede) and put Honny therein, and drinke it morning and 
evening, it heales all hurts and bruses inwardly. 
 
[}A good Plaster for greene wounds.}] 
 
Take one pound of sheepes Suit, of Bittony, Millfoyle, 
and Scabious, of each one handfull: of sweet Butter without 
Salt halfe a pound; beate all these together in a Morter, 
and let them stand seaven dayes in a moyst place till 
they be mouley; then boyle them and let them be well 
strayned, then cut halfe a pound of Wax in small peeces, 
and Rosin as much, boyle them with the strained Juices, 
and you have a good and needefulll plaine Plaster; use it 
boldly, and you shall find it will performe what was promised. 
 
[}A good Vngnent for wounds.}] 
 
Take Turpentine one ounce, oyle of Roses foure spoonefulls, 
[^p.3^] 
two yolkes of new laid Egges, mingle all these 
together and apply it on Lint, and over it lay the former 
Plaster. 
 
But if it be for a wound where the flesh is brused, then 
lay it thicke on with fine Flax, and over it the whites of the 
Egges mingled with oyle of Roses, and roule it gently up. 
 
[}A good cooling Plaster for greene wounds.}] 
 
Take Ceruse three ounces, and sallet Oyle one pint, boyle 
them till it be reasonable thicke, and then ad to it two ounces 
of yellow wax, so have you a good Plaster. 
 
[}An Vnguent for wounds.}] 
 
Take Turpentine of Uenice two ounces, Honny of Roses 
one ounce, Barly meale halfe an ounce, then mingle them, 
and if it be too thicke, adde a little oyle to it and use it. 
 
[}A good Vnguent for brused wounds.}] 
 
Take Rosin, Pitch, and Wax of each two ounces, of sallet 
Oyle one pint, boyle them, and you shall have a good blacke 
oyntment. 
 
[}An excellent Balsome for wounds.}] 
 
Take sallet Oyle one pint, Wheate purged from the 
huskes and beaten, two ounces; put your Oyle and Wheate 
together, then take S. Iohns wort, valerian, and Carduus 
Benedictus, of each one ounce; infuse them in one pint of 
white wine eight houres, then put your Oyle and wine together - 
and let them boyle till the oyle have consumed the 
wine: then straine it and adde to the liquor foure ounces of 
good Turpentine, and let it boyle a little on a gentle fire, 
and you shall have a good Balsome, which you must use 
warme, and use a Plaster over it if you will; if not, dip 
[^p.4^] 
a cloth in the Balsame, and lay it over the wound as you 
would a Plaster. 
 
[}Another good Oyle for wounds.}] 
 
Take oyle Olive halfe a pint, gum Elemny one ounce, 
Aqua vitæ three spoonefulls; boyle them to the consumption 
of the Aqua vitæ, and you shall have an oyle to cure all 
wounds. 
 
Sometimes the wound about the edges, and round about 
the wound, is very much inflamed and red, so that the patient 
cannot take any rest day or night; if it be in the beginning, 
use oyle of Roses thereto, and over all apply a linnen 
cloth, wet in one part of vinegar and two parts of faire water; 
or make this oyntment and lay it thereon: 
 
[}Vnguent.}] 
 
Take oyle of Roses one pint, Ceruse finely beaten two 
ounces, Camphore one quarter of an ounce; mingle them in 
a stone Mortar till it come to a perfect bodie, and you shall 
have a good cooling salve. 
 
[}A Poultis for the same.}] 
 
Take Mallowes, and Checkweede, one handfull of each, 
bruise them small and boyle them in Cowes milke, with a 
little Barly meale, and put some oyle of Roses to it, and 
apply it warme. 
 
Many times there growes a proud flesh in the wound 
which must be taken away ece that the wound will heale; 
to doe this take allome and burne it on a Tyle, and then 
pouder it and strew of the pouder on the proud flesh. Also 
you may use a red pouder which you may buy at the Apothecaries, 
but you had best to apply it with the burnt Allome; 
mingle them together, and it will worke the better. 
 
Also you may take greene Copperasse, and burne it in a 
pot till it be white and use it; it will doe its worke well, but 
it will worke painefully: but if you mingle some of these pouders 
with some unguent above written, it will worke the 
gentlier. 
 
[^p.5^] 
I would wish you, if you have any neighbour that hath 
skill in Chirurgery, to take his counsell in this case; for 
though the advise of many simple and pratling women, many 
honest people have beene spoyled, therefore take no such 
advise. 
 
[}For bleeding of a wound.}] 
 
If a wound bleed much, take the white of an Egge and 
some milldust, mingle them and lay it on with Flax or 
Lint, and binde it fast, and it will stop the bleeding; it hath 
beene often tryed and never failed. 
 
Or if you be in the field that you can have none of these 
things at hand, then doe thus, it is both easie and certaine. 
Take of the Messe that growes at the roote of an Oaken 
Tree, and lay it on the wound, and binde it close, and it will 
stop the blood. 
 
Also take old and cleane linnen, burne it as you doe Tinder 
to strike fire with, and lay it on the wound, and it will 
stop the blood. These two last remedies I have seene used 
in the warres, when nothing could be gotten nor any Chirurgion 
was by to helpe the wounded men. 
 
That wholesome Hearbe Sage stamped and layd to a 
wound, will stanch the blood. 
 
The like doth Hearb-Robert, Pinckneedle, or Cranesbill; 
it groweth commonly in hedges, bruise them and lay 
them on the wound. 
 
Cinque-foyle or fiveleaved grasse doth the like, also 
Lysimachia or Lousestrife hath the same vertue. 
 
[}For bleeding at the nose.}] 
 
I have many times seene men bleede so fearefully at the 
nose, that unlesse there had beene present helpe, the parties 
had dyed; yet by these medicines and helpes following they 
were presently recovered. 
 
Let the party lye on his backe, and let him have a wet 
cloth to receive the blood in, that his cloathes may be kept 
cleane: then bathe his Temples with cold water, and lay a 
double napkin wet in water and vinegar in his necke, and 
[^p.6^] 
hold your two fourefingers hard on his Temples, and tell 
him also that it is stanched, though it bleede still; for that 
will worke strangely on his imagination and I have often 
found, so that he will gather strength suddainly, and the bleeding 
will cease. 
 
I have found good successe by applying a cloth (wet in viniger 
and water) to the privy members; also by binding 
of the Arme on the same side with a garter, as the Chirurgions 
doe when they will let one blood: but you must not 
keepe it so bound longer than you may tell forty, but loose it 
and bind it againe; so doing till you finde that the blood is 
diverted, and stayd. 
 
[}A pretty way to stanch bleeding at the Nose.}] 
 
If the party bleede on the right side, then bow downe the 
little finger of the patient on the right side; if the patient 
bleed at the left nostrill, then bend the little finger of the 
left hand. I received this as a truth from a friend, if you 
prove it, you can receive no hurt by it. 
 
[}Another remedy for bleeding at the Nose which 
hath helped divers to my knowledge.}] 
 
Take Aloes one ounce, Mill dust, haires of a hare cut 
very small, whites of Egges, of each sufficient; take fine 
Flax and wet in it; when it hath beene well mingled, then 
make them pyramid-like, and put one of them into the 
nose that bleeds. I knew a woman of good fashion, who 
told me when shee was 16. yeares of age shee was taken 
with a great bleeding at the nose; this Flux of blood notwithstanding 
all the counsell of Physitians and of Chirurgions 
dured for the space of 48. houres, so that she was so 
weake that they expected her departure out of this life. An 
old woman comming in amongst other women and seeing 
her lye in that pittifull case, said that if Mugwort were applyed 
to the soles of her feete, questionlesse the bleeding 
would stay. In briefe, Mugwort was applyed, and she was 
suddainly helped. Thus much for bleeding at the nose, an 
accident by which many have lost their lives: but use these 
[^p.7^] 
remedies that I have set downe, and with Gods helpe you 
shall be able to helpe both your selfe and your friends. 
 
[}Of wounds comming by biting of beasts.}] 
 
The biting of madde dogges brings many times great 
danger, and for want of knowledge many dye of it, twelve 
Moneths after, as may be seene daily; if therefore any one 
be bitten, enquire whether the beast were madde or not; if 
the dogge or other beast that bit were not mad, then so much 
the better, and you neede feare the lesse. 
 
If the wound be little, wash it with Uinegar and Honny; 
then lay some Treacle to it mingled with Turpentine and 
Butter, or else Garlicke and Onions stamped with Butter. 
 
If the dogge were mad then take Treacle and wine, and 
rub the soare till it bleede, then apply Lint dipt therein, and 
over it Garlicke or Onions stamped and mingled; doe this 
seaven dayes together, and then apply other salves wherewith 
you cure wounds withall. 
 
It were good that the partie so bitten should take something 
inwardly to defend the heart, for the which take of Ueuice 
Treacle the eight part of an ounce with some sweet 
wine; but if you have none, then take stale beere, mingle 
them and make it warme, and let the patient drinke it off 
and sweat after it. 
 
This Uenice Treacle you may buy at the Apothecaries; 
it is of such rare worth, that I could wish that every countrey 
man had of it in his house, the vertues are many, some 
of which I will set downe in these few words. 
 
[}Venice Treacle}] 
 
Doth cure all paines of the head in man or woman that 
comes through cold it is excellent good for all that are heavy 
hearted and fearefull, for those that have the falling 
sicknesse or any defluxion that proceedes from a cold cause, 
it helpeth the toothach and the falling of the pallat, if the 
[^p.8^] 
place where the paine is be touched with it, and a plaster 
layd on the temple from whence the Flux commeth; it is 
good for the Squinancie, and helpes the dead palsie in the beginning; 
it is good for the paine of the stomacke, spitting 
of blood, for the griping of the belly and the bloody Flux; 
it helpeth the Crampe and those that are taken with Convulsions, 
which is drawing of the mouth and other members 
on the one side. 
 
It breakes the stone, causeth the monethly termes, and 
destroyeth all infirmities of the wombe. 
 
It is good for the Gout, Sciatica and paines of the Hips; 
but principally it is given for a helpe against poyson; it helpeth 
exceedingly against the bitings of mad Dogges or any 
other living thing, whether it be inwardly applied or outwardly 
on the wound, it helpeth those that are troubled with 
the quartan Ague, being taken a little before the fit commeth. 
I use to give it for the Ague with Carduus Benedictus 
water; iust when that they feele the fit comming let them 
take it and so sweate after it, it never yet failed me in this. 
 
[}Of falls and bruses.}] 
 
Often times it chanceth that many men in building fall 
from off the house, and many times lye as though they were 
dead with the paine thereof. 
 
Also in felling of Trees men are soare brused, and not 
having remedy for them, they often perish for want of 
health: if such a misfortune come to thy friends or servants, 
doe as I shall direct thee, and feare not to doe much good with 
little charges. 
 
If the partie falne lye without mooving as one dead, to 
know whether he be dead or not, doe this. Stop his nostrills 
and lay a feather or a little wooll on his mouth, and if there 
be any breath in him, they will stirre; If then that there is 
life in the partie, put a little Pepper in his nose to make him 
sneese: and if he doe bleed with sneesing, it is the better. 
 
If you can get any to doe it, let him blood in the arme; my 
[^p.9^] 
reason is this: the blood with the fall is fled inwardly to the 
heart, and lyes there in such quantity, that unlesse it be diverted 
by opening a veine, it is in danger to putrifie and corrupt 
the inward parts, and so occasions death. 
 
If the bruise be on any part of the body (I meane under 
the head) annoint it with oyle of Roses, or give him some 
hot comfortable drinke to make him sweate, as good Muskadine, 
old Sacke, or Sacke and sallet Oyle; or Treacle 
and Carduus-water, and apply this outwardly. 
 
[}A Poultis for bruises.}] 
 
Take Cammomile, Wormewood, of each one handfull, 
red Rose leaves halfe a handfull, Barly meale one handfull, 
boyle them soft in water, and put fresh butter or oyle of 
Roses to it, and lay it hot on the place that is hurt, and cover 
him warme. 
 
Wine Uineger and Sugar given to drinke is good, for it 
prevents all putrifaction and rottennesse, also if it be a 
little bruise, apply a cloth that is well wet in water and salt, 
for it is good. 
 
[}A most excellent easy meanes for those that are hurt by 
falls or bruised: it is often approved and fouud 
good to my knowledge.}] 
 
Take a Weathers skinne so soone as it is fleade off, and 
strew it with fine salt, and lap the patient so falne therein, 
but annoint him first with Oyle of Roses, and so let him 
sweate. 
 
Then for inward meanes give him this drinke hot. 
 
[}A drinke for bruises.}] 
 
Take Plantaine leaves, and S. Iohns wort, Bittonny, 
Tansy, fiue leaved grasse, Colts foote, of each halfe a handfull, 
sweet Margeram, and Sage one handfull: stampe them 
[^p.10^] 
and boyle them in three quartes of white wine, but if you 
have no white wine, then boyle them in running water, add 
to it Honny, and boyle away the third part of it, then straine 
it and drinke thereof warme, morning and evening. Probatum 
est. 
 
Wild-Sage boiled in white wine or in water with Honny 
is excellent for all falls or bruises. 
Likewise Pellitory of Spaine cald in English Masterwort, 
boiled in wine, or water and Hony, is very good for the same. 
 
[}A Poultis for blowes or stroakes.}] 
 
Take Barrowes grease, Bran of Wheate, Fenegreke 
meale, Honny and wine, seeth all together and apply it to 
the bruise or stripe; it helpeth with speed and giveth ease. 
 
There is in Ireland a certaine spring that sendeth forth a 
muddy or fat water, this water through the heate of the Sun 
becommeth hard as a stone, and is of a darke blew like our 
Salte, and it is called Irish Slate: this Slate being scraped 
with a knife and drunke in Beere, Oyle or Wine, is good 
for all bruises, falls and also for the loosenesse of the belly. 
 
[}A good remedy for a poore man.}] 
 
If the man faln or bruised be so poore that he hath no bed to 
sweat in, then annoynt him with this following, and set him 
for to sweat in horse dung up to the chin, and cover his head 
with hay, this is so good meanes as may be used, but it is 
neither cleanly, nor chargeable. 
 
[}The Oyntment.}] 
 
Take a pound of sweete butter, put it in a frying pan, then 
take of parsly, and mosse, of each one handfull of Rew or 
hearbegrace, halfe a handful. chop them small and fry them 
in the butter till that the hearbes be dry, then straine them 
and annoint the partie falne therewith. 
 
[^p.11^] 
If that the patient, be falne on his backe that there is 
great paine, and yet no bone broken or out of Joynt, then doe 
thus. 
 
Take halfe a pecke of Bran, boyle it in water that it be 
almost dry: then put to it two pound of Butter and stirre it 
well, then put it in a trough and let the man hurt lye on his 
backe therein. 
 
Doe thus three times the day, and when it is cold renew 
it with hot Bran out of the kettle. 
 
Then annoint him with Dialthea, or Spermaceti, or else 
one of the former Oyntments. 
 
[}To drive away setled or blacke blood.}] 
 
Take hard white Sope, commonly called Castle-Sope, 
cut it in small peeces; take of this Sope foure ounces, of 
anguentum Dialthea two ounces, of the best Aqua vitæ one 
quarter of a pint, melt them and annoint it twise a day. 
 
[}A drinke for a poore man that is bruised.}] 
 
Take earthwormes dryed, and oaken coales beaten, infuse 
these in Uinegar foure houres, then straine them and 
adde to it of Madder foure graines, warme it and drinke it. 
 
[}For one that is beaten on the face that it is 
blacke and blew.}] 
 
Take the iuce of wilde Saffran roote, and annoint it, or 
the iuce of Solamons Seale, Vng: Album, and the white of 
an egge, mingle them and annoint it in the morning, evening, 
and at noone. 
 
[}This is approved for blacke Eyes.}] 
 
Take the roote of blew flower Deluce, beate it with red 
rose water, then lay betweene a linnen Cloth and apply it 
[^p.12^] 
to the eyes, this never failes. 
 
[}An Oyntment to soften all hard lumps, swellings, and Bruses, 
in any part of the Body; whether it cometh 
of inward or outward cause.}] 
 
Take Mallow rootes one pound, Lint seed halfe a pound. 
Cut your rootes, and bruse your seedes then steepe them in a 
pottle of water three dayes: at the three dayes end seeth them 
till the water be as a Slyme, then take one pint thereof, and 
mingle it with Hens grease, Goose grease, and Neates-foote 
oyle, of each halfe a pint; boyle them till the watrish part be 
consumed, then ad Waxe six ounces, Rosyn three ounces, and 
of Turpentine one ounce: let them boyle a little; and when 
you take them off mingle them in a morter till it be cold, and 
reserue it to your use. 
 
[}For Deafenesse and paine in the Eares.}] 
 
Many times poore men (that want the helpe of a Physition) 
by the want of means are troubled with deafenes and 
paine in the Eares: it cometh many times through cold, or 
by grosse humors stopping of the eares, or by an Impostum, 
or els some thing falne into the eare; those that are so troubled 
speake very low, and are troubled in their Sleepe. 
 
In a Sun-shyning day looke in his eare to see the occasion 
of his paine, if any thing be falne into it, seeke to get it out, 
with some small Instrument: or doe this, let one person, or 
other blow into the eare so strongly as possible he can, and 
that a pretty space, then on a suddain let him sucke so strongly 
as he can: this is a good way to get any stone, graine, or 
any other thing out of the Eare. 
 
[}For a Worme or Fly got in the Eare.}] 
 
Put therein a drop of oyle of Wormewood, or the Iuce of 
nut-rindes, or peach leaves, or doe this. 
 
[^p.13^] 
Take a ripe Apple of good savour, cut it in two, and hollow 
it that the eare may come into it: apply this warme 
when you goe to bed, and in the morning you shall find the 
worme dead in the Apple. 
 
[}For Singing, or Piping in the Eares.}] 
 
Put oyle of Hempeseede warme into the eare, and stop it 
with sheeps wooll, and let the Patient leape and use exercise, 
then lye downe on the side that he is payned, to see if any 
thing will run out. 
 
[}To restore Hearing.}] 
 
Stampe Earth-wormes, Emets egges, and the leaves of 
hearbgrace; boyle these in Sallet oyle, and let one drop fall 
into the eare warme, 
 
[}For one that is Deafe.}] 
 
Take Rosemary and Rew, of each, halfe a handful: Chop 
them and boyle them in vineger, when that they are boyled, 
take a funnell that will fit the mouth of the pipken, wherein 
the hearbes were boyled, cover it with the funnell and 
receive the fume into the eare, then put in a drop or two of 
oyle of bitter Almonds, and let him sweate after it. 
 
Take greene Ash and put it into the fire, it will drop forth 
a liquor: this save and put into the eares that are payned, 
and it will cease the paine. 
 
[}This is good for all paines in the Head, and for Deafenes.}] 
 
Take Sallet oyle, Scalion seed, and the blades of leekes, 
with Wormewood and Rosemary, boyle these, and being 
strayned put one drop into thy eare, then stop it and lye not 
on the same side in sixe houres after 
 
[^p.14^] 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take the fat of an Eele roasted, take an Onyon and 
Sengreene that groweth on the Tiles, beate all these together 
and straine it, and put thereof into thy eare warm, and it 
will take away deafenesse. 
 
[}Against all Diseases that afflict the Eyes.}] 
 
There are many diseases incident to the Eyes, and they 
proceed of divers causes; they are written of at large in sundry 
bookes of learned men: and are not to be understood of 
every meane capacity, therefore I will passe over the causes, 
and for the signes, they are apparent enough, therfore I will 
set downe sundry approoved remedies for them. 
 
[}To draw backe the humores that offend the Eyes.}] 
 
Take leaven, figges and mustardseed, beate these into a 
paste, and put to them a little vineger, and lay as much behinde 
in the necke as a five shilling peece of silver, this will 
draw a blister in one night, the next day cut the blister and 
lay to it a Colewoorte leafe, and it will draw it and heale it, 
this is safe and workes without danger. 
 
[}A Plaster to stop the Reume.}] 
 
Take Gum Elemny, and make a plaster on a little veluit 
or leather, and apply it to the Temples, and it will stay 
the Reume, that floweth to them. 
 
Also take white frankensence and make a plaster, it will 
doe the like. 
 
[}For hot Running Eyes,}] 
 
Take an Apple, cald a Pomewater, boyle it in running 
water, then take of the pap and mingle it with a little white 
[^p.15^] 
bread crum that is soaked in a womans milke that gives a 
man Child sucke, put of this betwixt a fine linnen cloth and 
lay it to your eyes when that you goe to bed, and you shall 
finde great ease therein, this is without danger, and found 
perfect good. 
 
[}For a pearle growing in the Eye.}] 
 
Take ground Iuye, put some white wine thereto and 
stampe it, then straine it and put one drop into the sore Eye, 
morning and evening, and it will cure it without faile. 
 
[}Another for the same.}] 
 
Take the white of an egge, and the Iuce of Perritory of 
the wall, beat them well together, and scame them: then put 
thereof into the Eye, and it will helpe it by Gods assistance. 
 
[}Others for Red and blood-shotten Eyes.}] 
 
Take new cheese often washed in faire water, beate it 
with the white of an egge and apply it to the eye, this is approoved. 
 
Take white Suggar-Candy, beate it very fine and put 
some of it into the eie, this is a secret, that hath holpen many. 
 
Take the gaule of a Partridge, put some into the Eyes, 
and it will helpe the dimnesse of the sight. 
 
The same doth the gaule of a Turtle dove, or the blood of 
a house dove. 
 
The Iuce of checkweed hath the same vertue. 
 
[}An excellent water for soare Eyes, and to cleere the Sight.}] 
 
Take foure sponefuls of white rose water, white Copperis, 
as much as a pease, ginger pared full as much, three Cloves: 
let these stand three houres in a beere glasse and with a feather 
scame off that which doth arise, then straine it and keep 
it in a viall, close stopped, and drop therof into your eye when 
you go to bed. 
 
[}A salve for Red and running eyes.}] 
 
Take fine pouder of Tutty, foure parts; May butter three 
[^p.16^] 
parts, Oyle of roses, two parts; melt these and mingle the 
powder till it be cold, and anoynt your Eyes therewith. 
 
[}For the Tooth-ach many approoved Remedies.}] 
 
The Tooth-ach, is a paine wherewith many people are 
much troubled, and it is a paine (being not mortall) the 
greatest of all other. 
 
The cause proceedeth from the Sinews, being very hot, 
or very cold, or else a great quantity of humors falling from 
the head to the gummes. 
 
The signes are expressed by the patients grievous complaint, 
therefore I will set downe some remedies that I 
know are approved, and will give ease to the poore Patient. 
 
[}A plaster for the Temples to stay the humour 
that falles on the Gummes.}] 
 
Take Dragons blood, and pouder it, then mingle it with 
the white of an egge, and apply it to the Temples on both 
sides. 
 
[}An excellent Oyle for the teeth, which hath 
helped many to my knowledge.}] 
 
Take a sheete of white paper, teare it in small peeces, and 
burne it in a pewter dish, and there will come an oyle from 
it, with this oyle touch the aking tooth, or if it be hollow stop 
it with some of this oyle, it cureth it presently and is quickly 
gotten. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
A learned and worthy Chirurgion on a time was grievously 
troubled with the Toothach, he used all the meanes, 
that he could thinke on for ease, but he found none; an old 
woman, coming to his house by chance and seeing him so 
payned, bid him to take a Clove of garlick and roast it, and 
lay it to his payned tooth; he did so, and was presently eased, 
[^p.17^] 
thus Ambrose of Paris, sets down in his, booke of Chirurgery. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take salt mixt with dow, and bake it against the fire, 
and so laide on the Tooth easeth it presently. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
When thou art troubled with the Tooth-ach, take good 
Aqua vitæ, and snuff up a little into the nostrill of the same 
side wherin you are payned, and that will ease you. 
 
Also take good Methridate and rub your gummes where 
you are payned, and that will helpe presently. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Boyle henbane roote in vineger, and take of the vinegar 
and hold it in your mouth, and that doth ease it. 
 
Boyle Coliquintida in vineger and hold it in your mouth, 
it helpeth. 
 
[}To breake an hollow Tooth.}] 
 
Fill the Tooth with Crowes dung, and it breakes the 
Tooth, and ceaseth the payne. 
 
Take the roote of Pellitory of Spaine, and hold it in your 
mouth on the same side, and it helpeth without faile. 
 
Pepper, Salt, and Garlick, beaten and put in a cloath and 
held in the mouth, is very good. 
 
[}For an hollow Tooth.}] 
 
Fill the Tooth with Treakle, and then take a sharpe stick 
of an Ash and burne it in the fire, and whilst it is lighted put 
it in the hollownesse of the Tooth, and it will leave aking. 
 
But the best thing that you can do for a tooth that is hollow, 
is to plucke it out, or else it will be ever painefull, and 
corrupt your other teeth: but take heed that you meete with 
one that is expert in tooth drawing, least he break the Iaw, 
or pul forth a wrong tooth, as it once happened to a poore man 
that would have a Tooth drawne. 
 
[^p.18^] 
Merry tales sometimes easeth paine, and I know the 
Toothach is painefull: if it would ease you I care not much 
to tell you a tale of a Tooth-drawer. 
 
[}A good Tooth-drawer.}] 
 
In a Country village there dwelt a Tooth-drawer which 
was so famous in his Art that he was sought after farre and 
neere: this Tooth-drawer had a lusty young man to his servant, 
who had seene many Teeth drawne by his master, 
(with an Instrument, cald a Pellican, which will draw 
two teeth at one time unlesse it be skillfully handled) yet never 
had he drawne any, which made him resolve that the 
next that came to have a Tooth drawne in his masters absence, 
he would venture on him. It chanced that a simple 
plaine man came on a day (when his master was at dinner) 
to have a tooth drawne, my yong Barber was glad of that, 
and bid him sit downe: and to worke he went with him 
with a Pellican, but see how it chanced, he for want of skilll 
set the Pellican so that with his lubbers strength he drew out 
two of his sound teeth, and left the rotten in his head. 
 
The man perceiving this began to cry out upon my yong 
Tooth drawer and said that he had spoyled him, the Tooth-drawer 
seeing his error, and fearing his masters correction: 
(having a quicke wit) said to the Country man, friend let 
not my Master know that I did draw you two teeth out, for 
if he doe, he will make you pay for two; the poore man, fearing 
his words, to save his purse, paide him for one tooth, and 
caried the other as secret as though he had stolne it, and the 
third that pained him, he carried home in his head. Take 
heed how you draw teeth therefore. 
 
[}For the falling downe of the Pallat of the mouth.}] 
 
The cause of it is the recourse of humors from the head 
to that place; it is knowne by the sight, and great difficulty in 
swallowing of meate. 
 
[^p.19^] [^Original misnumbered as p.16.^] 
Take salt well dryed, and pepper beaten, mingle them 
together and touch the pallat therewith. 
 
[}A Mouth Water.}] 
 
Take three branches of Rosemary, nine sage leaves, and 
twenty Acorne cups; boyle them in a pint of water with one 
spoonefull of honny, and so much allome as an hassell nut, 
wash it with this water being well warmed, and it will 
helpe it, it is also good for a sore throate. 
 
Lay a whole egge that is hard sodden, (the shell being 
pilled of and the egge brused) to the Crowne of the head. 
 
Bakers leaven being layed to the crowne of the head helpeth 
it. 
 
The Ashes of Colewort rootes burnt, and put with your 
thumbe to the pallat, doth help it by drying up of the humors. 
 
[}For the Cough and hoarsnesse.}] 
 
The Cough commeth of superfluous humours that commeth 
from the head, or of cold, dust, smoake, and such like; 
hoarsenes is when the humour falleth into the windepipe: 
for this I will set downe some few, but good remedies for 
the poorer sort, for the rich let them use the counsell of the 
Physition, who is to be honored for our healthes sake. 
 
Seeth Bay berries in water, and receive the fume thereof 
at your nostrils and eares, and that will dry up the distilling 
humor. 
 
[}A good remedy.}] 
 
Take halfe a pinte of good aqua vitæ, and two ounces of 
fine suggar, set them on the fire, and when it beginnes to be 
hot, set fire thereon, and let it so burne that it may be like a 
surrup: take thereof morning, and evening, two spoonefuls 
at a time, and you shall finde great comfort by it. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take mustard seede and beate it grossly, then put it into 
[^p.20^] 
blew figges and eate three of them morning and evening, it 
doth dissolve the grosse humors, and openeth the Conduits 
of breathing. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Almonds, and blanch them, then stampe them with 
honny and eate of it, it easeth a long continued Cough. 
 
Some old women, say that a cold Apple eaten to bedward, 
is good for the Cough. Let them, that have over hot stomackes 
use it, for my part I know a good Cup of buttered 
Ale is not amisse, and that is my medicine. 
 
[}For one that hath suddainely lost his strength, and 
through debility of the vitall, and naturall 
spirits, is ready to fall into 
a Consumption.}] 
 
This cometh commonly after some great evacuations, as 
some greate fluxes of the belly, or some vehement motion, also 
sorrow, feare, and of intemperate, and disordered living; 
you may know it by faint sweates, and weakenes of all parts 
interior, and exterior: let the patient eate meate of light disgestion 
and of good nourishment, and above all things avoyd 
anger, and let him use merry, but honest Company. 
 
Let the patient eate every morning two egges, that are 
reare roasted, and let him mingle with them, white Sugar-candy, 
nutmegs beaten, and white amber, of each alike; this 
is very nourishing. 
 
[}An excellent Drinke for all those that are 
weake or in a Consumption.}] 
 
Take two gallons of small Ale, Almonds blanched halfe 
a pound, Aniseeds, three ounces, foure sticks of good liquerish 
slyced, red roseleaves, two branches of each: boyle them, till 
halfe be consumed, then straine them, and adde to it one 
quarte of good malmsie, drinke thereof, morning and evening, 
two houres before you eate; this drink preserveth a man 
[^p.21^] 
from the Cough, makes a man of a strong constitution, and 
helpeth very much against the Consumption. 
 
[}An approoved remedy used by a learned German 
Doctor with great successe.}] 
 
Take of your garden Snailes, and put them in a bucket 
with a handfull of salt, and they will scoure themselves, from 
their slyme, then wash them agayne in fresh water, then 
boyle them in other water, but not much but onely, that you 
may picke them out of their houses; being out of their houses, 
boyle them in a pottle of new milke so long that they are all 
to peeces, and the milke thick thereof, then straine them, and 
adde Sugar-candy that is very white, three ounces, foure fat 
Nutmegs slyced, Cinamon beaten halfe an ounce, sixe dates 
clensed, and cut very small; boyle all these againe, on a soft 
fire a little while, and then reserve it to your use, drinke 
thereof first, and last, and you shall finde great profit by it. 
 
[}Another good medicen for the same.}] 
 
Take a good plumpe Cock, put it into a gallon of running 
water in a close pot that is well covered, adde thereto three 
branches of Rosemary, halfe an ounce of Cinamon, grosly 
beaten, one ounce of Chyna roote, sixe Cloves, one Nutmegge, 
a little sweete Margeram, and the bottom of a penny 
white loafe; boyle these til half be consumed, then take up 
the Cocke, and let the patient smel thereto, for it will strengthen 
his spirits, and let him drinke the broath, as he hath a 
stomacke. 
 
[}Against fluxes of the Belly:}] 
 
The fluxes of the Belly, is a disease that weakens a man 
very much in a short time; it is caused often times by eating 
of much raw fruite, also by great heate or cold, and cheefly by 
vlcers in the bowels, by receiving of unproper medicens 
inward, that are purgative. 
 
Above all things, let the patient take heede of using much 
[^p.22^] 
cold drinke, and let him keepe his belly very warme, and not 
sit long on the close stoole, or other place, where he easeth 
himselfe 
 
Venice Treakle is good for all fluxes of the belly. 
 
[}A good and pleasant Medicine.}] 
 
Take sallet oyle, halfe a pint, of nutmegs beaten halfe an 
ounce, of Cinamon, one ounce, of mace, a quarter of an ounce, 
of fine sugar, halfe a pound; mingle these together, and eate 
of it, three or foure times a day, it hath cured many to my 
knowledge. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take blanched Almonds and boile them in hony till they 
be blacke, and eate them fasting, it doth restaine the fluxe 
wonderfully. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take old cheese and toast it, and then dry it, and take therof 
with Sugar, and it stoppeth very much. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take pouder of Comfry rootes and acorne cups, Cinamon 
grosly beaten, and one Nutmegge slyced; boyle these in a pottle

egges to it, and eate thereof every morning, it is exceeding 
good. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take a Slate tyle; burne it, and then pouder it very fine, 
and mingle it with three yolkes of egs, and bake it in a pan 
and eate it, this cured one that had it halfe a yeare. 
 
[}Another secret of worthy esteeme.}] 
 
Take a pottle of milke, and boyle it in an earthen pot till 
[^p.23^] 
the fourth part be consumed; then have a quarte of plantaine 
water, and put one pint into it, and so let it boyle, til the fourth 
part be consumed, then put in the other pint of water and let 
it boyle as before, till the fourth part be consumed; then reserve 
it, and drinke three times a day thereof, this is a sure 
and good receite. 
 
[}Counsell for the laske.}] 
 
Make a board hot, and sit thereon, also apply a hot Trencher 
to your navill, and it will ease you. Take also of Irish 
slate, and drinke it, it is very good. 
 
[}Of wormes in the Body.}] 
 
Wormes are engendred divers waies, but cheefly they are 
bred with putrified phleame, in the Stomacke or Bowels; 
from this disease proceedeth great paine in the stomacke and 
Belly, with a great desire of meate: many people die of them, 
for they breed sharpe feavers which are dangerous, therefore 
I will set downe some remedies, such as I know have beene 
tryed and approoved good. 
 
[}Remedies.}] 
 
The best and safest way is to take of pure Aloes, beate it 
to pouder, and take a little in the cold pap of a roasted Apple; 
this is knowne to be good, and may be given to the weakest 
people. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Let the Patient drinke raw milke, foure dayes together, 
the first day give him garlicke, stamped in Milke to drinke, 
and put a little suggar therein. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Tansie, and a little Worme-wood, and boyle it in 
a quarte of water, then straine it, and put hony thereto, and 
seeth it, and scame it; drinke heereof morning and evening, 
and it will kill all Wormes whatsoever. 
 
[^p.24^] 
[}Another.}] 
 
Boyle scraping of Hartes horne in Milke, and drinke it, 
and it will helpe you. 
 
Also Garlicke boyled in Milke, is excellent therefore, if 
the Navell be anoynted with bitter Almonds, and the iuce 
of Worme-wood, it will kill them. 
 
[}A Plaster.}] 
 
Take the iuce of Worme-wood, and a little Oxe gaule, 
mingle these with a little Wheaten meale, and the white 
of an egge, and spreade it on a leather, and lay it round about 
the Navell, it will cause abundance of Wormes to be 
avoyded. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take the iuce of Mint, Ribwoort, Orpin, Peachleaves, 
and housleeke; mingle these with strong vinegar, Ore gaule, 
oyle of Peaches, and Smallidge seede beaten, make an oyntment 
and use it to the Belly and Navell, or els make it a 
plaster as was taught before. This is approved. 
 
[}For the Emeroyds or Piles.}] 
 
There are certaine reins which end in the fundament, 
these many times are oppressed with mellancholy blood. so 
that they are vere painefull and doe oftentimes bleed exceedingly, 
for this infirmity use some of these remedies that 
follow. 
 
[}A good remedy, that is often approoved.}] 
 
Take three little bagges, made of old linnen cloth, fill 
them with wheaten meale, let them be of that bignesse, that 
they may be so great as a goose egge; when that they are filled 
then put some white wine over a chafing-dish with coales 
and let the bagges be through hot therein, and apply one to 
[^p.25^] 
the fundament, and when that is cold, take a nother doe this 
for the space of halfe an houre, morning and evening. 
 
Annoy at the place afterward and lay thereto with a little 
wooll, oyle of Roses, rubbed in a leaden morter till it be of a 
leaden Colour. 
 
This hath given many men ease, when divers other things 
failed, therefore take it as a great secret. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take the leaves of henbane, and purslaine, cut them very 
small, then take crummes of whitebread, and boyle all 
these in milke, till they be very soft; then put the milke 
from them, and beate them with the yolke of a hard roasted 
egge, and oyle of Roses, and apply it to the fundament, it 
doth helpe the same very speedily. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take an Unguent that the Apothecarie calleth populeon, 
and of the unguent called Album, mingle them together and 
apply it. 
 
Also the unguent called Pompholigos is very good applyed 
plasterwise. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Eldern leaves the least, that be tender, and Chickweed, 
fry these with sweete butter, till that the hearbes are 
dry, then straine them, and with the liquor that cometh forth 
anoynt the piles, and dip wooll therein, and apply it. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
If that the piles be swolne and are painefull, yet doe not 
run, then boyle horehound in water and wine, and salt, put 
it into a close stoole, and sit over the same, and receive the 
fume into your body, so hot as you may suffer it, then lay the 
hearbe so boyled to the fundament. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Mullen, by some called Mullet, the leaves thereof 
[^p.26^] 
be hoary, and white; boyle of these leaves in Wine, and bath 
it with the liquour, and then lay of the leaves to the place, 
where your paine is, and it helpeth. 
 
[}For the Stone in the Reines or Bladder.}] 
 
The Stone is a grievous and pittifull disease, and the 
poore are much troubled with it, as well as the rich; it proceedeth 
from great heate, which doth dry up grosse humors into 
hard Stones, which descend from the kydnies, into the bladder, 
tormenting the poore Patient with intollerable pain; in 
this disease the counsell and skill of a learned Physition, is 
needfull, yet for the comfort of poore people, that cannot alwaies 
have their good assistance, I will set downe certaine 
good choyce remedyes, that have helped many. 
 
[}Remedies for the Stone.}] 
 
Take nine Iuie berries, dry them, and give them in white 
Wine warme, it doth mightily provoke vrine, and purgeth 
gravell. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take the stones that are found in a Haddocks head, beate 
them to pouder, and drinke them in white Wine. 
 
The stone cald Oculus Cancri doth the same. 
 
The stones of Medlers poudred doth the like. 
 
The like doth the stone that is found growing in the gall 
of some Oxen. 
 
[}Receive this as a great secret.}] 
 
There is a Beast which lives in the Sea, in the West-Indies, 
called a Sea-Cow, or Mannatee, this beast or fish, 
hath certaine stones that grow in his head; the pouder of this 
stone drunk in Wine, or other liquour causeth the taker therof 
presently to make water and to voyde gravill: many that 
hath traveld in those parts will affirme this for truth. 
 
A learned Author saith, that if you doe annoynt your yard 
[^p.27^] 
and the share, with the blood of a Foxe the stone will breake 
incontinently, for saith the same Author, put a stone into the 
blood of a Foxe, and it will breake in three dayes. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take egge shels dry, them and beate them unto a pouder, 
it will breake the Stone, it hath beene prooved. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Boyle seaven heads of Garlike, in raine water, and give 
the same water to the patient for to drinke, three dayes together, 
it is prooved for to helpe in this disease. 
 
[}A Remedy for the Stone strangely found out.}] 
 
A certaine High Dutchman, being very well skild in cutting 
for the Stone, was on a time called to an old Gentleman, 
which was very much troubled with that Infirmity, he 
having searched him, found the stone to be of such an extraordinary 
bignesse, that he would not deale with it, a while 
after this Gentleman dyed, he being acquainted with his 
friends, desired to open him for to see the stone, in breife he 
did, and found it so great, and of such a length, and hardnes, 
that he wondred thereat, for it was so big that he made a 
haft for a knife thereof; this knife he being once at supper, 
left on the Table, and the cloath being taken up, the knife 
was (unwittingly) taken up with it, and so cast on one side 
with the fragments; next day he missed his knife, and search 
was made fore it, and it was found in a voyder, amongst 
scrapings and peeces of Raddish rootes: but so strangely altered 
that he greatly wondered thereat, for through the vertue 
of the Radish (against that disease) the haft was found 
wholly to be consumed: which made him ever after, for to 
use Radish, against that disease. 
 
Whether this be true or not, I will not examine, but this 
I know. Take a Radish roote and steepe it in white Wine, 
all night, and give it to drinke, to one that cannot make his 
[^p.28^] 
water, it will worke very effectuall, and voyd both water and 
gravill. 
 
[}Of the swelling of the Cods.}] 
 
The swelling of the Cods cometh by outward, and inward 
occasions, the inward cause is abundance of bad humors, 
which often times take their course to those parts, much offending 
the poore patient with great paine; this cure cheifly 
consisteth in remooving of the cause by phisicall meanes. 
 
The outward cause of this swelling, is taking of great cold, 
also blowes and strokes; the signes are apparent, great swelling, 
and rednesse, with extraordinary paine. 
 
[}A Remedy.}] 
 
Take one pint of new milke, the crums of white or wheaten 
Bread, one handfull of Chickweede, one handful of mallowes, 
chop the hearbes small, and boyle them in the milke: 
then adde thereto a quarter of a pound of sweete butter, and 
apply this warme to the part that is pained, and trusse it up 
with his shirt or napkin, and in short time he shal find ease. 
 
[}Another Remedy if it be red or inflamed.}] 
 
Take Beane meale, halfe a pint, sallet oyle, a quarter of 
a pint, (if you have no oyle, take sweete butter) vinegar a little, 
mingle all these together, and apply it cold, you shall see 
it worke effectually, above your expectation. 
 
[}When the Cods are sweld with much paine.}] 
 
Take wheaten bran, and the dregges of strong ale, boyle 
these together and put a peece of sweete butter thereto, and 
apply it to the part hot. This will give ease without faile. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take beane Flower, and mingle it with the iuce of walwort 
and sweete oyle, apply it to the Cods and it taketh away 
the swelling incontinent. 
 
[^p.29^] 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Cow dung and dissolve it in Wine, and fry it with 
sweet butter, and it taketh away the swelling of the cods. 
 
[}For Warts, and Cornes.}] 
 
Warts are of divers formes, and very troublesome, by 
reason that for the most part, they are on the hands, which 
are continually used, they proceede of a mellancholly humor, 
and are cured according to their formes; Corns proceed most 
commonly from wearing of straite shooes, they are cause of 
much paine, by reason they doe most commonly, grow on or 
about the feete. 
 
For the first that are called Warts, if they doe grow in 
such a forme, that they are lesser at the roote, than at the head, 
then knit a silke thread about them and every day tye it 
straiter, at the last it will cut the wart off without bleeding, 
if you doe wet your thread in Mercury water, it will be the 
better: if it be bigger at the roote than at the head, then put 
Brimstone, in pouder thereon and set fire to it, and so burne 
it out, though this be painefull, yet it is the best way, and wil 
not suffer them to grow againe. 
 
[}Remedies for Wartes.}] 
 
Take the iuce of marrigolds, and wet your wartes therwith, 
and dry them against the Sunne, do this three or foure 
times, and it will cure them. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take a red Snaile and bruse it with salt, and take the iuce 
and wet the wartes with it, and it will kill them. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take - wartwort, or spurge, and wet them with the iuice, 
and it will heale them. 
[^p.30^] 
Purslaine rubbed on the Warts consumeth them. 
 
[}Remedies for Cornes.}] 
 
The best way is to cut them so deepe as you can. But it 
were best to tye a little peece of veale, all the night on the 
Corne, and cut it in the morning. 
 
After that you have cut the Corne fill up the hole with the 
sand that growes on the bottom of a foule chamber pot, and 
over it lay a plaster of red waxe. 
 
[}Another}] 
 
Take a Cowes gaule, and wet it therewith, and it will 
plucke it up by the rootes. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take of the pouder of Aristabours, and mingle it with 
Barrowes grease, and it will make it fall in foure dayes, 
then put Copperice into the hole. 
 
[}For the Gout.}] 
 
The Gout is caused as the Phisitions hold opinion, by excesse, 
as surfetting, drunkennesse, much using of Womens 
company, immoderate exercise, and also by much ease; the 
doctors know better how to give names to it than to cure it, 
for a Welchman hath not more names (and harder) than it 
hath; as for example, they call it Sciatica, Chiragra, Podagra, 
pechiagra, Gonagra, and Arthritica; it commonly keepes good 
company, as Bishops, Cardinals, Dukes, Earles, Lords, 
Knights, Judges, Gentlemen, and Merchants; the reason is 
(as it is thought) for the bad entertainement that it once had, 
at a poore mans house, when master Gout was a traveller, 
which a witty, and well conceited Author sets downe in this 
manner. 
 
[^p.31^] 
[}A tale that is true enough.}] 
 
A great while agoe, when Monsieur Gout was not so rich 
(as now he is;) he was forced to travell, as other poore men 
are sometime, in his travel he met with a spider, whose iourney 
lay as Mr. Goutes did: they being both benighted, they 
sought lodging, and came to a poore mans house, which the 
Gout tooke up for his lodging, for he being alwayes a laisie 
companion, would goe no farther, but the Spider being 
more nimble, went to a rich mans house, and there tooke up 
his lodging for that night: the next day they met againe, and 
asked each other of their entertainement the passed night, 
mine saide the Gout, was the worst as ever I had, for I had 
no sooner touched the poore mans legs, thinking ther to take 
my rest, but up he gets, and to threashing he goes, so that I 
had no rest the whole night. And I, saide the Spider, had no 
sooner begun to build my house, in the rich mans chamber, 
but the Mayde came with a broome, and tore downe all my 
worke, and so fiercely did pursue me, that I had so much adoe 
to save my life, as ever I had. 
 
Seeing it is so then, saide the Gout, we will change lodging, 
I will goe to the rich mans house, and thou shalt goe 
to the poore mans: they both were well content, and did so, 
and found such ease and rest in their lodging, that they resolved 
never to remoove, for the Spider builded and was not 
troubled, the Gout he was entertained with a soaft Cushion, 
with downe Pillowes, with dainty Caudels, and delicate 
broathes; in briefe: he did like it so well, that ever since he 
takes up his lodging with rich men, where I desire that he 
should take his rest, rather than in my poore house. 
 
Then may one say, if that poore men be free of it, what need 
I to speake thereof? I doe it for poore prodigals, who often 
spend their monies, yet keepe this disease. 
 
[}Remedies to ease the Gout.}] 
 
Take the fat of a Cat, Goose grease, Badgers grease, Fox 
[^p.32^] 
grease, of each alike; then take Iuy, Sage, Bay leaves, Rosemary, 
white Wax, yolkes of roasted egges, with a quantity 
of red Snailes: bruse them together & them put into a pot that 
hath holes made in the bottome for that purpose, and let it be 
close covered that no ayre may issue forth: put under this pot 
another that is whole, and bury them into the earth, so farre 
as the mouth of the uppermost pot, then make a good fire 
thereupon, and you shall have in the bottome of the lowermost 
pot a precious oyntment that is good for the Gout. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Tyme, and the white of an egge, beate them together, 
and apply it plasterwise and it is both a good and healthfull 
medicen for the Gout. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Hares dung, mingle it with wine and apply it warme, 
and it healeth those that are pained with the Gout. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Use a bath of Sea water, and it will ease you. 
 
Also a bath wherein Dock-leaves, and Emmets with 
their egges have beene sodden, doth the like. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Wormewood, Walwoort, Wheate bran, Goates 
dunge; boyle them in vinegar till the vinegar be consumed, 
then stampe it and apply it hot. 
 
[}For all manner of Burning whether it be with fire, 
pouder, lead, oyle, or any other thing.}] 
 
Divers times it happens, that Men, Women, and Children, 
come to strange mishaps by burning and scalding, and 
the friends, and parents of the parties so burnt (by reason of 
their remote dwelling, and want of skill in such casualties) 
[^p.33^] 
are not furnished with such remedies as are to be used in 
such accidents; for the releefe of them onely, I have set downe 
such things as are both good, and easy to be gotten uppon such 
occasion, you may be bold to use them, for I know them safe 
and sure. 
 
[}For burning with common Fire.}] 
 
Take fresh butter and melt it, then poure it into cold water, 
and wash it so long that it be so white as snow; then poure 
the water off, and reserve the butter in a pot, with this only 
dresse the burning, and it shall fetch al the fire out; that being 
done, heale it with some skinning salue, as you shall find 
in the booke. 
 
Whether it be oyle, milke, or water, wherewith the patient 
is scalded withall, you neede use no other thing to fetch 
the fire out but this. 
 
[}For burning with Iron, Lead, Copper, or any other mettle.}] 
 
If the burning be with any mettle, as Iron, Lead, or such 
like, then shall you not presently apply fat things to it, but do 
as I shal direct you, and you shall be sure to find benefit by it. 
 
Take nightshade water, and snow water, mingled, and apply 
it to the burning with linnen cloath doe this 24. houres 
together, in which time the fire will be out of it; then do this. 
 
Take fat Bacon, cut it in small peeces, and melt it then 
poure it into snow water, and beate it that it be very white, 
then apply it thicke to the burning, and you shall finde, that 
it will doe what you did expect. 
 
When the fire is out, use some skinning plaster, these 
things are plaine, but sure. yet to give full satisfaction to all, 
I will set downe some other things that are approoved. 
 
[}Remedies.}] 
 
Take oyle of nuts, and common Wax, melt them together 
and use it. 
 
Lintseed oyle, or common oyle will doe the like. 
 
[^p.34^] 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take Lime, and wash it in nine severall waters, then 
mingle it with common oyle, but stirre it exceedingly; with 
this annoynt the place, and it will helpe it. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take the white of an egge, and mingle it with oyle of Roses, 
or common oyle, till it becom an oyntment; apply it with 
cloth thereto, and it will heale without any great or manifest 
scarre. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
If the skin be not broken, then stampe Onions with salt, 
and apply it with linnen cloath. 
 
Or use blacke soape, or honny mingled, and it will keepe 
it from blistering, but take heede that you use it not where 
that the skinne is broken, for it will cause great paine. 
 
[}Another.}] 
 
Take butter milke, wet cloathes therein, and apply it to 
the burning, and it will take the fire out of it; also cheese 
curdes will doe the like. 
 
[}Of the small Pockes, and Measels.}] 
 
The small Pockes, and measels is common in England, 
and other Countries, and therefore they neede no description; 
yet for the furtherance of ignorant people, I will in few 
words set downe, how that you may know when one is infected, 
and also what is best to be done in this disease. 
 
[}Signes.}] 
 
The signes when one is infected are these, first he, or shee 
is taken with a hot feaver, great paine in the back, stopping 
of the nose, beating of the heart, hoarsenes, rednesse of the 
Eyes, with paine and heavinesse in the head pricking in 
the whole body, drynesse in the mouth, shortnes of the breath 
and difficulty in breathing 
 
[}Good Signes.}] 
 
When they doe soone and in short time appeare, and that 
in their comming forth, they doe looke red, and after that 
[^p.35^] 
they come forth, they doe looke white, and with speed they doe 
come to ripen; when they do draw the breath easily, and that 
the Feaver doth leave them, these are good signes. 
 
[}Ill Signes.}] 
 
When the Pockes lye hidden in the flesh, and do not come 
forth, or if after their comming, they doe suddainly strike 
in againe, and vanish away, or that they doe looke of a black 
blewish, or greene, colour, that the sicke doe often swound, if 
their breath is drawne with paine, if he have a great scouring, 
if that the pockes come double, that is, one growing 
within another, or when they doe rise like blisters, and suddainely 
fall flat with a hard blacke crust, as if it had beene 
burned, all these are ill signes, and death most commonly 
doth follow them. 
 
[}The Cure.}] 
 
For the Cure hereof, you must ffrst strengthen the inward 
parts and drive the disease outward, and then have a care 
that both inward and outward, parts be not hurt thereby. 
 
To drive them forth, keepe the sicke body in a reasonable 
heate, and give unto him the weight of sixe pence of good 
Treacle in Burrage water. 
 
Or take a quart of posset ale, a handfull of Fennell seede, 
boyle them till a third part be consumed, then straine it, and 
put thereto sixpence weight of Treakle, and a little Saffran, 
give of it to drinke, morning and evening, halfe a pint at a 
time. 
 
Or take a quarte of ale, put thereto Rosemary, and sweete 
Margeron, and Sage, with three Bay leaves and a little saffran; 
boyle them all and drinke thereof a little, and sweate if 
you can. 
 
Also Saffran boyled in milke, is very good to drinke hot, I 
have knowne good women use this to their Children, with 
good successe. 
 
[}To preserve the Eyes.}] 
 
Take Rosewater, six spoonefull, Womans milke, that 
[^p.36^] 
gives a boy sucke, three spoonefull, Sugar candy a little 
mixt together; apply it to the eyes, with a three double cloath 
till the danger be past. 
 
[}To preserve the Eares.}] 
 
Put a drop of oyle of Roses, warme into them ere that he 
sweate. 
 
[}To preserve the Nostrils.}] 
 
Let him smel to red rose vinegar, or boyled with saunders. 
 
[}To preserve the Throate.}] 
 
Let him hold alwaies white Sugar Candy in his mouth, 
and as it melteth, swallow it downe. 
 
[}To preserve the Lungs.}] 
 
Give him to drinke Barly water, wherein Liquerish hath 
beene boyled. 
 
[}A Salve for them after they are come forth.}] 
 
When that they are come forth and begin to grow white, 
then take a pinne, and open them on the top and thrust out 
the matter inclosed very gently, for it is that matter that by 
its sharpenesse, eates into the flesh, and leaves such pits as 
you shall often see in the faces of those that have had the smal 
Pockes; when you have done thus, then annoint the places 
with this oyntment following. 
 
[}An oyntment for the Pockes.}] 
 
Take Eldernleaves, one handfull, Marigolds two handfull, 
French Mallowes, one handfull, Hogs grease, halfe a 
pound, bruse them and boyle them till they be crisp, then 
straine it and keepe it to your use. 
 
If you annoynt them with the oyle of sweete Almonds, it 
healeth them very faire. 
 
Some use in the sommer time, to touch them every day 
with the iuce of Marigolds, and so healeth them. 
 
[^p.37^] 
[}For spots in the face when that they are well.}] 
 
Take iuce of Lemons, and mixe it with bay salt, and touch 
the spots therewith often times in the day, for it is excellent 
good. 
 
[}How to open the Eye-lids, that are fastned 
together with the Pockes.}] 
 
Boyle Quince-seedes and Mallowes in faire water, wet 
double cloathes therein and lay them over the Eyes, continue 
this till you can open them, and then if you perceive any 
web or filme to be growne over the sight, put white Sugar 
Candy poudered into it, or you may dissolue it in Rosewater.
