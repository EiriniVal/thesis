[}PHARMACOPOEIA 
BATEANA.}] 
 
[}LIB.I. 
Of Compound Internals.}] 
 
[}CHAP. I. 
Of WATERS.}] 
 
[}I. Aqua Aluminosa, Alumed 
Water.}] 
 
Bate.] +R ALUM and 
White Vitriolana: 
mix 
them together, 
and 
boil them in an earthen Vessel, with 
a gentle Fire, till they become like 
a Stone: pouder it; and to every 
spoonful thereof, add boyling Water 
a quart: dissolve and filter. It is 
profitable against Wounds, Ulcers, 
Fistula's, &c. washing them therewith. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. If to every pint 
of this Liquor you add +o ij. of Spirit 
of Wine or Brandy, it will be 
almost of double vertue to that of 
the prescript. 
 
§ 2. For Spirit of Wine has a 
wonderful power, being mingled 
with fit Medicaments to cleanse, 
purify, heal, and glew together 
Wounds and Ulcers, especially 
those of the nervous parts, which 
it does safely, as we have taught 
in our Ars Chirurgica, lib. 5. cap. 12. 
Sect. 25, 26, & 35. 
 
§ 3. I know by almost a thousand 
Experiences, that this Alumed 
Water, is a most admirable 
thing against a Herpes miliaris, and 
all manner of Tettars and Ringworms, 
or Serpigines, and such like 
breakings out in any part of the 
Body, tho' of never so many years 
standing. 
 
§ 4. The way of using it is 
thus: Put some of it into an 
earthen Bason, over a Chafing-dish 
[^p.2^] 
of Coals, and with a Cloath 
let the diseased bathe well the place 
affected, as hot as they can endure 
it, for a quarter of an hour or 
more at a time; and do it two or 
three times a day, or oftner, as 
need requires. 
 
§ 5. It will in a short time 
cure the Tettar, let it be never 
so inveterate and rebellious. 
 
§ 6. I cured two Gentlewomen 
of inveterate Tettar's herewith, 
the one of which had been troubled 
with the distemper above 
twenty years. 
 
§ 7. It is also a most admirable 
Injection in a Virulent Gonorrhœa, 
or the Whites in Women, 
Universals being premised, injecting 
therewith warm three or four 
times a day. 
 
§ 8. It is also a good Collyrium, 
curing weeping Eyes, and 
strengthning them, taking away 
Clouds, Films, Pearls, &c. 
 
[}II. Aqua Animalis, The Animal 
Water of Horse-dung.}] 
 
Bate.] Take Horse-turds newly 
made, N=o= xij. White-wine a Gallon: 
sweet Fennel-seeds, Parsly-seeds, ana 
+o ij. Grocers Treacle, or Molosses, 
lb j. Polypody of the Oak, Butchers 
Broom, Liver-wort, and M ij. Ginger 
+o iij. mix and distil according 
to Art with a gentle fire. It prevails 
against Pleurisies, Pains, Rheumatisms, 
&c. Dose ad +o iv. sweating 
upon it. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It is not only 
good against Pleurisies, which is 
the chief design of the Medicine, 
but also against the Gravel and 
Stone, whether in the Reins or 
Bladder, as also Pains and Stoppages 
in the Urinary Parts, it dissolving 
the mucous Matter to a miracle. 
 
§ 2. It may be given to old or 
young from +o ij. ad +o vj. and may 
be repeated four times in twenty 
four hours. 
 
§ 3. But it will be much more 
effectual, if you add to every Dose, 
as it is taken, twenty or twenty 
five drops of Spirit of Sal Armoniack, 
in the Case of a Pleurisy; 
or fifteen Grains of Sal Prunellæ 
in Nephritick Diseases. 
 
§ 4. +o vi. of it immediately 
given upon a Surfeit is an admirable 
thing, and might save the 
Life of many a poor Creature, 
which otherwise for want of it 
would be lost. 
 
[}III. Aqua Antiphthisica, A Water 
against Phthisicks.}] 
 
Bate.] +R The Blood of a Calf 
new killed, freed from its Fibres, 
by beating together lb iij. Venice 
Turpentine ten Ounces; Liquorice 
not dried lb j. Raisons stoned 
+o xij. Fat Figs, N=o= 100. Garden 
Snails, N=o= 70. fresh Orice-roots 
+o vj. Spanish Tobacco cut +o ij. Crums 
of White-bread lb j. mix and distil 
according to art. Dose +o ij. with its 
proper quantity of Oyl swimming 
thereupon, being all mixt together 
with a Pectoral Syrup, and taken for 
fifteen days. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. If this Medicine 
should receive a gentle Fermentation 
before Distillation, it 
would be so much the better, for 
by that means the Sulphur of the 
Fruit and Turpentine, being more 
[^p.3^] 
intimately mixt with the Aquous 
parts of the Blood and Snails, a 
more volatile Liquor would come 
over the helm. 
 
§ 2. Ox Blood, or Sheeps or 
Lambs-blood, may equally serve 
in the same Case: But I have 
found by experience, that Hogs-blood 
exceeds them all. 
 
§ 3. This in some Constitutions 
will gently Vomit, and in others 
cause a most admirable Expectoration, 
cleansing and healing 
Ulcers in the Lungs to a wonder, 
and thereby cure Consumptions, 
take away Coughs and Colds, shortness 
of Breath, and Obstructions of 
the Lungs, and cause a free breathing. 
 
§ 4. If it is given for the 
Cure of Ulcers of the Lungs, or 
Consumptions, it would be good 
to mix it with a little Tincture of 
Catechu, made with common Spirit 
of Wine. 
 
§ 5. But if it is given in Coughs 
or Pleurisies, or Obstructions of 
the Lungs, then it would be profitable 
to add to each Dose +q j. of 
Spirit of Sal Armoniack, or de 
Cornu Cervi. 
 
[}IV. Aqua Antiscorbutica, The Water 
against the Scurvy.}] 
 
Bate.] Take Leaves of Fumetary, 
Water-cresses, Scurvy-grass 
both sorts, Brook-lime. ana M. xij. 
Harts-tongue, Cichory, Pine-tops, 
Germander, Horehound, Agrimony, 
Centory the less, ana M. x. mix: Roman 
Wormwood, Liverwort, ana 
M. iv. Bryony Roots +o viij. Roots of 
Female Ferne, Dock, Bitter-sweet, 
inward Bark of the Ash; ana +o vj. 
Ash-keys +o i +s. Seeds of Angelica 
+o +s. all being fresh and bruised, add 
Rhenish-wine lb vj. in which a red 
hot Iron has been twenty times quenched: 
Express all strongly out with a 
Press, and distil the Liquor in 
B.M. (adding Troches of Capers 
poudered +o vj. Lime of Mars +o i +s.) 
to the thickness of Honey, the Magma 
evaporate to the consistency of an 
Extract, which keep for the Antiscorbutick 
Extract. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. I think it 
would be more effectual if Plantane-leaves 
and Roots, M. x. were 
also added, because that Herb is a 
peculiar thing against the Scurvy. 
 
§ 2. It is an excellent Antiscorbutick, 
and a Water that may be 
profitably given in all cold and 
weak Stomachs, and such as cannot 
digest their Food. 
 
§ 3. It opens Obstructions of 
the Viscera, sweetens and strengthens 
the Blood, preserves its Crasis, 
and is profitably given not only to 
young Girls against the Green-sickness, 
and in Scorbutick Rheumatisms, 
but also to aged People, 
to comfort and strengthen them. 
 
§ 4. Which it effectually does 
if given ad +o ij. Morning and Evening, 
(a little dulcified with white 
Sugar) for fifteen or twenty days 
together. Dose of the Extract a~ 
+Q j. ad +Q ij. 
 
[}V. Aqua Antiscorbutica altera, The 
other Antiscorbutick Water. 
Micklethw.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Leaves of Aron, Garden 
Scurvy-grass, Water-cresses, 
common Wormwood, ana. M. vj. fresh 
Orange-peels +o iv. Nutmegs +o ij. infuse 
[^p.4^] 
for a Night in a Gallon of Brunswick 
Beer or Mum, and distil according 
to Art. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. You may profitably 
add to the Composition 
Brook-lime, Rochet, A.M. iij. Mustard-seed, 
Radish-seed, ana +o iiij. 
 
§ 2. The four Ounces of Orange-peels 
must only be the yellow 
Rind pared off from the 
white, which in this case is of no 
great worth. 
 
§ 3. It is a good Antiscorbutick, 
given with other things to the 
same intention. 
 
§ 4. It purifies the Mass of 
Blood, cures its Discrasy, and facilitates 
its Circulation; and is very 
profitable for such Women or 
Maids as have an Obstruction of 
their Courses. 
 
Dose by it self (sweetned) is 
from +o j. to +o ij. in the Morning 
fasting; and in obdurate Obstructions 
it may be given from +o ij. 
to +o iv. either alone by it self; 
or mixt with a glass of White Port 
Wine. 
 
[}VI. Aqua Bechica, a Water against 
a Cough.}] 
 
Bate.] Take Leaves of Ground-Ivy, 
Colts-foot, Oak of Jerusalem, 
and lb iij. Hyssop, Rosemary, Penny-Royal, 
Horehound, ana lb i +s. roots 
of Elecampane and Liquorice, and 
lb i +s. Orrice Florentine +o xij. Figs 
cut lb iij. of the best Saffron, Anniseed, 
sweet Fennel-seed, ana +o +s. 
Spirit of Wine lb x. Fountain Water 
lb 48. digest a while, and distil 
by a Vesica lb xxiv. or xxx. for 
to make the Syrupus Tolutanus Magistralis. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. The Title shews 
the chief design, as being good 
against Coughs, Colds, Stoppages 
of the Brest and Lungs, Wheesings 
and such like. 
 
§ 2. Dose a~ +o ij. ad iv. sweetned 
with white Sugar-Candy at 
Night going to Bed; it may also 
be taken in the day time in like 
manner, when the Cough proves 
troublesome. 
 
§ 3. And it may serve for a 
Vehicle to take Balsams of Sulphur 
in, or any other Pectoral or Antiasthmatick 
Medicine. However 
the Prescript tells you, it is to 
make the Magistral Suryp of Bals. 
de Tolu. 
 
§ 4. In Coughs or Colds you 
may mix +o ij. or iij. of it with 
a Spoonful of Tincture of Catechu, 
and so give it in a glass of old 
Malaga at Bed-time; or if the 
Cough is vehement, and there is 
also pain, instead of the Catechu, 
you may mix with it 12 or 16 
drops of the Anisated Balsam of 
Sulphur. 
 
§ 5. It is also good against a 
Pleurisy, whether Vera or Notha; 
but then in this case the Dose is to 
be mixed with gut. 15 or 20 of the 
Spirit of Sal Armoniack or Spirit. 
de Cornu Cervi. 
 
[}VII. Aqua Benedicta, the Blessed 
Water.}] 
 
Bate.] Take unslakt Lime lb j. 
to which affuse boiling Water lb viij. 
after the Ebullition is over, and it 
is sufficiently settled, filter it and 
keep it for use. Dose +o iij. or iv. 
thrice a day, or to be used as common 
drink for a Month; being drunk it 
[^p.5^] 
does much good in many cases, as 
in redness of the Face, Pustules, &c. 
in the King's Evil, Asthma, Phthisick 
or Consumption of the Lungs, 
Empyema, malign Dysenteries, watery 
and scrophulous Tumors, flux of 
the Whites, running Gout, Morphew, 
Freckles, Herpes, Tettars, Gangreens, 
Oedema, Swellings of the 
Knees and Shins, common Ulcers, 
with a Flux of Humors, &c. and 
in the cure of the Diabetes it is a 
most excellent Remedy. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. If a few Cloves, 
Jamaica Pepper, or some other Spice 
be infused in it to give it a relish, 
it will be so much the better. 
 
§ 2. It is certainly an excellent 
thing to sweeten the Blood 
and Humors, and to absorb the 
acid Juices lodging in them, by 
which means it prevails against 
Heart-burnings, Soreness of the 
Stomach, Griping of the Intestines, 
and such like. 
 
§ 3. You may make an excellent 
Injection for a Virulent Gonorrhea 
with this Water, thus; +R of 
this Lime Water +o x. Mercurius dulcis 
levigated +o j. mix, and shake 
them so long together, till the Mercurius 
dulcis precipitates down to 
the bottom of a black colour. 
 
§ 4. This Water is to be injected 
into the Yard with a Yard Syringe, 
or into the Womb with a 
Womb Syringe, always shaking the 
Bottle before you put the Syringe 
into it; and it may be used three, 
four, or six times a day, as need 
requires, letting the Patient make 
Water before-hand, if occasion 
be. 
 
§ 5. It cures also Tettars, 
Ring-worms, Herpes, and other 
Leprous breakings forth, if washed 
therewith, and some of the 
black Pouder strewed thereon. 
 
[}VIII. Aqua Benedicta Composita, 
The Blessed Water Compound.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Fresh Liquorice +o j. 
Bark of Sassafras +o +s. Raisins of 
the Sun stoned +o vj. Nutmegs +Q vj. 
Aqua Benedicta aforegoing lb vj. infuse 
without heat for two days, then 
strain and keep it for use. It is better 
than the former, and more efficacious 
in several Cases. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It is not only 
good against the afore-named 
Diseases, but it is also an excellent 
Pectoral, opening Obstructions of 
the Brest and Lungs, sweetning 
the acid Humours, and cleansing 
the Body of them. 
 
§ 2. And may be of good use, 
to be taken some few days before 
the Exhibition of a Purge or Vomit, 
for that it not only opens but 
also loosens the toughest Humour. 
Dose +o iij. two or three times a 
day. 
 
§ 3. It is an incomparable Remedy 
against the stagnation of the 
Blood, being given with Spirit. 
de Cornu Cervi, or Spirit of Man's 
Blood, or Spirit of Millepedes, 
or Earth-worms, in a Glass of 
Wine. 
 
§ 4. And it will serve also to 
all the Intentions and Purposes of 
the former Prescript, being used 
accordingly by those directions; 
and may be profitably used against 
Cancerous Tumors and Ulcers. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}IX. Aqua Camphorata, Camphorated 
Water.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Roman Vitriol, fine 
Bole, and +o iv. Camphir +o j. mix and 
make a pouder, of which put +o j. to 
boiling Water lb iv. remove it from 
the fire, and let the Fæces settle. 
With this Water, being warmed, 
wash any Ulcer: It stops all Defluxions, 
cleanses, dries, strengthens, 
fastens the Teeth, hinders Putrefaction, 
cures Ignem sacrum, Scabby 
Hands, and prevails wonderfully 
against Ophthalmies, Epiphora, and 
other Diseases of the Eyes. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. To reduce the 
Camphir into subtil Pouder, you 
must first drop upon it a small quantity 
of rectified Spirit of Wine, 
so with a Knife, or in a little Mortar, 
you may immediately rub it 
till it is impalpable, without which 
you will be troubled to bring it to 
a fine Pouder. 
 
§ 2. This Water is a good Collyrium, 
and prevails against all 
Diseases of the Eyes, taking away 
Mists, Clouds, Films, Pearls, 
Blood-shot, or any other Distemper 
which obfuscates the sight. 
 
§ 3. It also cures Ulcers in the 
Eyes, by washing them therewith 
two or three times a day; and is 
a most admirable thing against 
Herpes, Tettars, Ring-worms, or 
other breakings out in any part of 
the Body. 
 
§ 4. Tho' it may cleanse and 
dry Ulcers, and these in the Mouth 
also, yet I think it not a very convenient 
Medicament to be applied 
often to the Teeth, because all 
sorts of Vitriol are apt to blacken, 
discolour, or foul the Teeth, 
&c. 
 
[}X. Aqua Caryophyllorum, Water of 
Clove-Gillyflowers.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Clove-gillyflowers 
new gathered lb ij. Dates lb j. Anniseeds, 
Liquorice, ana +o j. Lees of 
Wine lb xxiv. digest and distil in an 
Alembick lb iv. to which add Sugar-candy 
+o iv. and hang it in a Nodule, 
Cloves N=o= iv. Musk and Ambergrise 
ana gr. v. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It is an excellent 
Cordial-water, good against 
Faintings, Swoonings, Sickness 
at Heart, Oppression of the Spirits, 
Wind, Gripings, and such 
like; and is very profitable to be 
given against the Plague, and all 
manner of pestilential Fevers, 
proceeding from Putrefaction. 
 
§ 2. It chears the Heart, revives 
the Spirit, comforts Nature, 
drives away Melancholy, making 
merry and pleasant; but by reason 
of the Musk, you must be cautious 
not to give it to Women troubled 
with Vapours or Hysterick 
Fits. 
 
§ 3. It strengthens the Brain 
and Memory, fortifies the Animal 
Spirits, and is good against 
cold Distempers of the Head. Dose 
+o j. in Wine or other convenient 
Vehicle, upon any Paroxysm or 
Fit. 
 
§ 4. As for the Dates; they 
add nothing to the Virtues of the 
Water, but are only a Charge; 
my advice therefore is, to leave 
the Dates out, and to put in instead 
of them, Jamaica Pepper +o iij. 
Nutmegs thin sliced +o ij. Caraways 
[^p.7^] 
+o j. Cloves well bruised, Winters 
Cinnamon, ana +o +s. 
 
§ 5. Nor is the Sugar-Candy 
to be put in before distillation; 
but it is to be made into fine Pouder, 
and put into the bottom of 
the Receiver, upon which the Water 
as it distils is to fall. 
 
§ 6. Being thus prepared, it is 
an admirable Stomatick, and wonderful 
good against Sickness at 
Heart, Melancholy, and pernicious 
Vapors from the Spleen, Reins and 
Womb. 
 
[}XI. * Aqua Cephalica, A Water 
for the Head.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Male Peony-roots +o iv. 
Roots of Angelica, Valerian, ana 
+o i+s. of Avens +o j. Leaves of Sage, 
of Rosemary, Betony, Marjoram, 
Bawm; Flowers of Lavender, Betony, 
Peony, Marigolds, Sage, Rosemary, 
Lilly Convally, of the Tile 
Tree, ana M. j. Stæchas +o i+s. Red 
Roses, Cowslips, and M. ij. Lignum 
Rhodium, yellow Sanders, ana +Q vj. 
Nutmegs +o i+s. Galangal +o +s. Cardamoms, 
Cubebs, ana +Q iij. infuse 
in the best White-wine lb xiv. for ten 
days, then add of the best Cinnamon 
lb j. digest for two days, and 
distil according to Art. It is profitable 
against the intemperature of 
the Head, Head-ach, &c. Dose 
two spoonfuls: Let it be drawn 
up the Nostrils, bathed well upon the 
Temples, and places about the Ears, 
dropt into the Ears, and held in the 
Mouth: And Lint dipt in it may be 
applied to the Nape of the Neck: it 
gives comfort to many, tho' to others 
it is used in vain. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. You must not 
draw it off to dryness, least the 
Matter tasts of Burning, unless you 
distil in Balneo, then you may be 
more secure. 
 
§ 2. But if you have not the 
conveniency of a Bath, but must 
make use of a Copper Vesica, with 
its-Worm, you must when you distil, 
add a Gallon of Water; 
then may you draw off, nearly your 
whole quantity, or so much according 
to the strength which you design 
it. 
 
§ 3. You may give it from +o ij. 
to +o iv. in any cold Distemper 
of the Head: But in hot Distempers 
it will make the pain 
worse. 
 
§ 4. If to the Composition 
you add Winters Cinnamon, Jamaica 
Pepper, ana +o j. Cloves well 
bruised +o ss. the Water will be much 
more Cephalick. 
 
[}XII. * Aqua Cerasorum Composita, 
Water of Black Cherries 
compound.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Black Cherries with 
their Stones well bruised, lb x. Red 
Cows Milk new milked, two Gallons: 
Leaves of Violet, Bramble, 
Self-heal, Wood-bine, ana M. iv. distil 
according to Art. Dose half a 
pint twice a day. It is a most powerful 
Remedy in the Cure of a Tympanites. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. This ought to 
be distilled in Balneo, if you would 
make the Medicine well; and then 
you may draw off the matter to 
dryness. 
 
[^p.8^] 
§ 2. The Water is Stomatick 
and Astringent; and is of good 
use for those who have old Sores, 
running Ulcers, Fistula's, &c. which 
are hard to Cure. 
 
§ 3. It may be used as a Vehicle 
for most other Medicines, 
especially for such as are appropriated 
to the Head, Heart, Stomach, 
and Womb, and is of singular 
Use for the Curing of Consumptions. 
 
[}XIII. * Aqua Chalybeata, Steeled 
Water.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Mars cleansed +o iv. 
White-wine lb iv. digest in the Sun, 
shaking the Glass every day, so long 
till the Wine grows black, and the 
Mars becomes altered in its colour; 
then add Juice of fresh Strawberries 
gently pressed forth lb iv. Sperma 
Ceti, Rhubarb, Mummy, ana +o +s. 
distil to dryness. Dose three or four 
Ounces twice a day in Fistula's or 
Ulcers of the Urinary parts, Apostems, 
Hemorrhoids, Pissing of 
Matter, Bruises, Coagulated Blood, 
&c. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It is a good 
Medicine before Distillation, in 
my Opinion, much better than after, 
being only filtrated. 
 
§ 2. It cures the Green-sickness 
in Virgins to a Miracle, and 
makes them have a good colour in 
their Faces, even in three or four 
times taking, presently taking away 
all their faintness, weakness, 
and indisposition to stir up and 
down. 
 
§ 3. Dose ab +o j. ad ij. in a 
Glass of Ale or Wine. 
 
§ 4. It also is good against 
Consumptions and dries Ulcers and 
Fistula's, wonderfully disposing 
them to a present healing. 
 
§ 5. Being distilled, it has 
some of the same Virtues, but 
scarcely of half the strength, and 
therefore is to be given in double 
the Dose. 
 
§ 6. But this advantage you 
have by Distillation, that tho' it 
may not be of half the Vertue, 
yet it is five times more pleasant 
than that undistilled. However, 
The former is preferable; and 
truly my Experience has confirmed 
it. 
 
[}XIV. * Aqua Chamæmeli Composita, 
Camomil Water Compound.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Camomil Flowers, 
M 30. cut, bruise, and infuse in Water 
stilled from Camomil it self, lb x. 
Spanish Wine lb xvj. digest for twenty 
four hours, then express; and infuse 
a second time fresh Flowers 
M. xx. Express again, and the third 
time infuse fresh Flowers M. xij. then 
add the yellow of Orange-peels fresh 
+o ij. Pontick or Roman Wormwood, 
Centory, Penny-Royal, Origanum, 
ana M. ii+s. Seeds of Dill +o ij. of 
Anise, Fennel, Caraways, Cumin, 
Carduus Ben. Ladies Thistle, ana 
+o i+s. Bay and Juniper-Berries, ana 
+o +s. Nutmegs +o iij. digest a sufficient 
time, then distil according to 
Art. It is prevalent against Wind, 
Cholick, Stone, Obstruction of the 
Courses. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It warms the 
Stomach, expels Wind, opens Obstructions 
of the Urine, and brings 
away Sand, Gravel, or other matter 
[^p.9^] 
stopping the Passages. 
 
§ 2. It is a Specifick against 
Pleurisies, Stitches, and Pains of 
the Side, coming from Cold or 
Wind, or both. 
 
§ 3. Dose ab +o j. ad +o iij. in the 
Morning Fasting. It is also found 
by experience to be good against 
intermitting Fevers or Agues. 
 
§ 4. It is a singular thing against 
Obstructions of the Spleen, 
and has been proved to be of good 
Use in Hypochondriack Melancholy,

thing against Consumptions,

be given in a Hectick, if the Sick 
drinks plentifully new Cows Milk,

Lime-water, which extinguishes 
the preternatural heat.

the Stomach and Bowels, or where 
sharp humors abound.

good against Faintings and Swoonings, 
and has the Vertues of the 
former, but is thought to be not 
altogether so hot. 
 
§ 2. It strengthens the Stomach, 
and very much revives the 
Spirits. Dose from three spoonfuls 
to six, either alone, or in any 
fit Vehiculum. 
 
§ 3. It is used more as a Cordial, 
than in Asthmatick distempers, 
and is singular good for lingring 
Consumptions, and where 
there is a wasting and lowness of 
the Spirits, and a decay of Nature. 
 
§ 4. It is good against nauseousness,

good success in Consumptions, Pinings, 
and Decays of Nature, and 
may be taken Morning, Noon and 
Night, from two Ounces to four, 
either alone, or in some fit mixture. 
 
§ 2. I have proved it in Consumptions 
oftentimes, giving it 
with Tinctura Martis, and by this 
mixture, have done wonders. 
 
§ 3. And so mixt, it may be 
given in Red Poppy-water, as a fit 
Vehicle, or with Spiritus Opii, the 
making and use of which we have 
declared at large, in Cap. 2. Sect. 
58. next following. 
 
§ 4. And being used with that 
Spiritus Opii, or with Spiritus Rhœados 
Crapularius, described in Sect.

up and down in it. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. Some parts of

whiten. 
 
§ 2. It also heals Ulcers, dries 
up Tettars, or other Breakings 
out in the Skin, taking away Scurff, 
Morphew, Sun-burnings, and other 
like Deformities. 
 
§ 3. But it ought to be used 
twice a day; and after the skin 
has first been Bathed for a pretty 
while, with almost scalding hot 
Water, whereby the Pores will 
be opened, and so made the more 
fit to receive into it the vertues 
and efficacy of the Medicine.

as well: +R Milk Water lb ij. 
smooth bits of Alum N=o= vj. or vij. 
weighing in all about half an ounce, 
which being shaked up and down in 
the Water, it is then to be used 
as the former.

Besides, that it wonderfully 
helps in an Alopecia, or falling of 
the Hair; it is very good against 
Deafness, being dropt into the 
Ears. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. If you infuse 
Pouder of Pomegranate-peels in it 
after Distillation, it will be more 
powerful to hinder a falling of the 
Hair. 
 
§ 2. Also if you infuse therein 
Black Pepper +o j. to lb j. of the 
Water, it will be of more than 
[^p.11^] 
treble strength in causing Hair to 
grow upon bald places. 
 
§ 3. And if you infuse Ant 
Eggs in it, being first bruised, it 
will be more prevalent against 
Deafness and thickness of Hearing; 
all which things you may use

Water in the Prescript. 
 
§ 3. These things thus jointly 
used, prevail also against the Scurvy 
and Dropsy, and all other ill habits 
of Body. 
 
§ 4. If to the Composition you 
add Leaves of the biting Arsmart 
lb iij. or Onions chopt small, 
lb i ss. the Receipt will be much the 
better.

distilled in BM. to dryness; otherwise, 
if in a Copper Vesica 
with its Alembick, you must add 
Water lb iv. or vj. and then draw 
but half off to avoid burning. 
 
§ 2. It is a good thing against 
Sand, Gravel, or mucous Matter 
obstructing the passages of the 
Reins and Bladder. 
 
§ 3. It is said to Cure a Strangury 
or Disury, from what Causes 
soever, except that from a great 
and hard Stone in the Reins or 
Bladder. 
 
§ 4. It is a good thing to open 
Obstructions, expel Wind out of 
the Stomach and Bowels, ease 
Cholick Pains, and facilitate the 
Birth of a Woman in Labour, especially 
being mixt with Powers 
of Penny-royal.

and is powerful to cause expectoration: 
Dose some spoonfuls

Salmon.] § 1. It takes away 
Wheesings and Shortness of Breath, 
and is prevalent against most Distempers 
of the Lungs, which obstruct 
or hinder Breathing. 
 
§ 2. Dose +o j. ad ij. in which 
ten or twelve drops of Spirit of 
Sal Armoniac may be mixt: thus 
taken it is good against Quinsies, 
Pleurisies, and the like. 
 
§ 3. If you give the Syrup of 
Fox-Gloves with this Water, it most 
effectually Cures Consumptions; I 
have done such great Cures by it 
thus given in Consumptive People, 
and such as have been given 
over as uncurable, as have put me 
into an amazement. 
 
§ 4. But then it is to be continued, 
and given for some considerable 
time, till it is manifest the 
Obstructions causing the Consumption 
are perfectly removed, and 
the Patient evidently regains flesh 
and strength. 
 
[}XXIII. Aqua Embryonum, a Water 
to preserve the Child in the 
Womb.}]

Pearled; an Electuary made of 
Conserve of Red Roses, Clove-gilliflowers,

Salmon.] § 1. This Medicine 
daily taken, nourishes the Child 
in the Womb, and prevents Miscarriage 
where it is feared, as also 
in such as are accustomed to 
it. 
 
§ 2. It is Cordial also, and restores 
in Consumptions. 
 
§ 3. If you distil in BM. you 
may draw off to dryness; otherwise 
you must add Water to prevent 
burning. 
 
§ 4. In Cases of Miscarriage, 
you may give it thus: +R Tincture 
of Catechu (made with common 
Spirit of Wine) +o +s. of this Water, 
from +o ij. ad +o iv. Mix for a

Evening. 
 
§ 5. Or you may give it mixt

Gentian, Zedoary, Liquorice, 
ana +o j. macerate in White-wine 
lb viij., for two days, then distil according 
to Art. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. You may distil 
in BM. to dryness; otherwise 
if in a Copper Vesica, you 
must add Water to prevent the 
Empyreuma. 
 
§ 2. This Water is profitable 
against the Plague or Pestilence, 
and all manner of malign and pestilential 
Fevers, &c. 
 
§ 3. It may either be given alone 
from +o ij. ad +o iv. or used as 
a Vehicle to convey other Medicines 
for the same intention, in letting 
the sick be in bed, and sweating 
well upon it. 
 
§ 4. In my Opinion, if three 
or four good large Limons were 
thin sliced and put (after Distillation) 
into the Water, it would 
be so much the better. 
 
§ 5. For that the particles of 
that acid Juice, certainly destroys 
all the Vermiculi, or Miasmata, 
which are the Progenerators of the 
Plague, or Pestilence; and also 
more powerfully overcome it when 
the Infection is begun. 
 
§ 6. For this reason it is, Vinegar 
is put into almost all our 
Plague-Waters, by Sylvius, Barbet, 
and others of the more learned 
Physicians. 
 
§. 7. Also if to the Composition 
you should add Jamaica Pepper 
bruised +o v. Winters Cinamon 
bruised+o iij. the Medicament would 
be very much the better. 
 
[}XXV. * Aqua Febrifuga, The Febrifuge-Water.}]

of Carduus Ben. of Carduus Mariæ, 
of Sorrel, ana +o ij. Leaves of 
Scordium, Goats Rue, ana M. iv. then 
distil according to Art. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. This Water is 
profitable against all manner of 
Fevers, whether continent, continual, 
or intermitting, commonly 
called Agues. 
 
§ 2. You may either distil in 
a Copper Vesica, adding a convenient 
quantity of Water to keep 
it from burning, or distil in a 
Glass Body in BM. then may you 
distil to dryness. 
 
§ 3. This Water is also good 
for a cold and weak Stomach, fainting 
Fits, Palpitation of the Heart 
and such like. 
 
§ 4. Dose two, four, or six 
spoonfuls, according to the Age, 
Sex, and as necessity requires.

of Pismires.}] 
 
+R Bate.] +R Of the larger Pismires 
(gathered in May or June) 
[^p.14^] 
lb j. Honey lb ij. Spring-water lb j. 
mix, and distil according to Art. 
Dose one Spoonful. It provokes 
Vomiting, and cures Tertian Agues. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. Let it be distilled 
in a Glass Body in Balneo; 
otherwise, if in a Copper Vesica 
tinn'd within, you must not draw 
off much above a quart, least the 
Water tasts of burning, and so the 
Medicine be spoiled. 
 
§ 2. If it be fermented before 
Distillation, it will make an Aqua 
Magnanimitatis, which will be 
good against Melancholy, Sadness, 
and dejectedness of Mind. 
 
§ 3. If this Water is mixed 
with Powers of Vipers (gut. 30. 
to +o ss. of the Water) it powerfully 
removes impotency, tho' of 
long standing: but they must be 
thus used for some considerable 
time. 
 
§ 4. Also the Instruments of 
Generation ought to be anointed 
daily Morning and Evening with 
this Oyl: +R Oyl of Ben +o iv. Chimical 
Oyls of Sassafras, Pulegium, Origanum, 
Savin, Limons, Lavender, 
ana +Q +s. mix them for use. 
 
[}XXVII. Aqua Fortis Duplex, Double 
Aqua Fortis, or Dissolvent 
of Silver.}] 
 
Bate.] It is made of Nitre and 
Vitriol, ana: distilled by a Retort 
according to Art. It dissolves 
Silver and Copper. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. Filings of Venus 
or Luna in Leaves may be dissolved 
by this Water: which being 
dissolved, the Water may be 
separated by BM. and the Calx 
of Luna, &c. will remain at bottom. 
 
§ 2. If you dissolve the Calx 
again in double the quantity of 
fresh AF. abstracting, and putting 
on fresh continually, you will at 
length find the Metal reduced to 
an Oyl at bottom. 
 
§ 3. For the fresh AF. does 
every time divide the Metalline 
Particles into infinitely finer and 
finer Atoms, till at length they become 
as it were a perfect Oyl, according 
to the Opinion of Paracelsus. 
 
[}XXVIII. Aqua Fortis Aluminata, 
Aqua Fortis made with Alum.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Alum, Nitre, ana lb j. 
Vitriol lb +s. mix and distil according 
to Art. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It is to be distilled 
by a Retort, as the former, 
and serves for the same uses. 
 
§ 2. But this is much better 
for some work than the former, for 
that it blacks not so much as that 
does; as in the dissolving of Pearls 
or Corals. 
 
§ 3. It is also better for the 
dissolving of Silver in order to the 
making its Crystals for the Pilulæ 
Lunares, which see in its proper 
place. 
 
[}XXIX. Aqua Herpetica, A Water 
against Tettars, Ring-worms, 
Itch, Scabs, Herpes, &c.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Roch Alum +o j. White 
Vitriol +o ij. best White-wine Vinegar

Leaves of Green Tobacco, M. j. boil 
to the consumption of a third part, 
[^p.15^] 
strain, and add burnt Vitriol +o +s. 
mix, and keep it for use. Cloths 
being wet in a sufficient quantity 
of this Water, are to be laid upon 
the Herpes, and permitted to 
dry on, four times, viz. till (the 
Scabs yet sticking on) a new skin 
be generated underneath. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It not only cures 
Herpes, but also Scabs, Itch, Tettars, 
Ring-worms, and other breakings 
out of the skin. 
 
§ 2. And I heard a certain Lady 
say (who constantly used it) 
that it will take away Lentils, Freckles, 
Pimples, Sun-burning, Tannings, 
and such like Deformities. 
 
§ 3. You may either use it 
with a Cloth, as aforesaid, or only 
by bathing the parts affected several 
times a day, but then you must 
be sure to let it be always very hot 
when you use it, so will it do five 
times more good than if you should 
use it cold; because hot it the better 
opens the pores, and penetrates 
the skin. 
 
§ 4. If you steep good Virginia 
Tobacco in the Water, and 
then use it for the purposes specified, 
it will be much more effectual 
to all the intentions for which 
it is designed. 
 
§ 5. You may regulate the 
Proportions thus: +R Of this Water 
lb ij. Tobacco grosly cut, stalks 
and all +o ij. Infuse in a gentle Balneo 
48 hours, and keep it for use 
upon the fæces. 
 
[}XXX. * Aqua Hirundinum, Water 
of Swallows.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Live Swallows N=o= 40. 
Castoreum +oj. White-wine lb iij. distil. 
It prevails admirably in cure 
of the Epilepsy. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. If you distil 
in BM. to dryness, and cohobate 
four or five several times, your 
Water will be so much the stronger 
and better. 
 
§ 2. For at length by many 
Cohobations, the Volatile Salt will 
in some measure ascend and mix 
with the Water, which at the first 
distillation it will not. 
 
§ 3. It is an excellent thing 
indeed in the cure of the Epilepsy: 
Dose ab +o j. ad. +o iij. every Morning 
for forty days together. 
 
§ 4. And if in every Dose iv. 
or vj. Grains of Sal Volatile Cranii 
Humani be added the Medicine 
will be so much the better. 
 
§ 5. You may give it either 
alone, or in Black-cherry-water, or 
Peony Water, Simple or Compound. 
 
[}XXXI. * Aqua Hormini Composita, 
Water of Clary Compound.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Leaves of fresh Clary 
bruised, M. xij. Spirit of Wine lb ij. 
distil to drynes: to the distilled 
Water cut fresh Clary, M. x. Flowers 
of Arch-angel, or dead Nettles, 
M. vj. and distil a second time: repeat 
the affusion and distillation with 
fresh Herbs and Flowers, adding also 
Nutmegs +o j. the Liquor distilling 
is to be received in a Glass upon 
double refined Sugar +o vj. Ambergriese 
gr. iij. tyed up in a Rag, and 
hung within the Vial. It is of great 
use (among young and tender Women) 
for preventing Abortion; it 
also stops the Whites. 
 
[^p.16^] 
Salmon.] § 1. You must distil 
it every time in a Glass Body, 
in BM. it being digested or macerated 
twenty four hours before 
distillation; and then you must 
draw off the Spirit with a gentle 
Fire. 
 
§ 2. It is good for the intention: 
But if you put into every 
quart of the Water Catechu in fine 
Pouder +o ij. and so make a Tincture, 
it will be ten times stronger to all 
the purposes aforementioned, and 
will also stop the most violent flux 
of the Terms. 
 
§ 3. Dose one or two spoonfuls 
at Night; but it is better to give 
it in Red Poppy-water, or with 
Spiritus Opii, than to give it alone. 
 
§ 4. And so used, it is much 
more prevalent in all the Cases aforementioned, 
especially where 
any pains or bearings down are 
present, or any show of the Terms; 
and those Women which thus use 
it according to my directions, I 
am sure will give me thanks for this 
my advice. 
 
[}XXXII. * Aqua Hungarica, The 
Queen of Hungary's Water.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Fresh Rosemary Flowers 
lb ij. Alcohol of Wine, i.e. the 
highest and best rectified Spirit lb iij. 
digest and distil, S.A. It prevails 
against the running Gout and Sciatica. 
Dose to one spoonful twice 
a Week. The Face and parts affected 
may be daily washed therewith; 
it may also be drawn up the 
Nostrils, as in the use of the Aqua 
Cephalica. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It is of singular 
good use against Palsies, Cramps, 
Convulsions, the Falling-sickness, 
Vertigo, Lethargy, Megrim, Head-ach, 
and indeed most Diseases of 
the Head, Brain, and Nerves, proceeding 
from a cold Cause. 
 
§ 2. It may be outwardly Bathed 
upon the part twice a day 
(for it is a neat and cleanly Medicine) 
as also drawn up the Nostrils 
against the Vertigo, Head-ach, 
Megrim, &c. 
 
§. 3. Inwardly it may be taken 
against all the same Diseases, 
as also against dimness of sight, 
cloudiness of Eyes, and even blindness 
it self, where it proceeds from 
an inward cause. 
 
§ 4. Nor do I believe there is 
any better specifick in the World, 
against weakness of the sight, hurt 
of the Optick Nerves and Palsies, 
than this very Water is. 
 
§ 5. But it ought to be taken 
every day about a spoonful at a 
time in a Glass of pure Ale or 
Wine, or some other convenient 
Vehicle, as Black-cherry-water, 
Aqua Lactis, &c. for a quarter of 
a year together, or more; yea, 
half a year if need requires. 
 
§ 6. In external pains of the 
Gout, Sciatica, &c. as also in vehement 
Cholicks (for which it is 
an admirable thing) it will be much 
more powerful, if you add to it 
(to every quart of the Water) +o ij. 
of the best Camphir; and then to 
Bathe the place affected therewith. 
 
§ 7. As also to take a spoonful 
of it at a time, in a Glass of 
Sack, in the most excruciating 
Cholick. 
 
[^p.17^] 
§ 8. This Water is a thing I 
have used many years in my practise, 
and have found it of singular 
use to a great number of Diseases, 
more than I have here time 
to enumerate. I always keep great 
quantities of it by me, and have sent 
it through the Nation, to the most 
considerable Persons of the Kingdom, 
Ladies of Quality, Physicians, 
Chirurgians, &c. 
 
§ 9. Those who desire it, may 
be supplied with what quantities 
they please, as good as can be made 
by Art, at very reasonable Rates. 
 
§ 10. It is good also to preserve 
against the Measles, Small-pox, 
Plague, or Pestilence, and other 
infectious Diseases.

common Wormwood, ana M. v. Rue 
M. iij. Angelica M. ij. being bruised, 
add new Milk three Gallons, mix and 
distil in a common Still. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It is better if it 
be distilled in a common Vesica 
tinn'd within, with a very gentle 
Fire, but much better if it be distilled 
in a Glass Body in BM. for 
then you may distil to dryness, 
and never hazard an Empyreuma, 
or taste of burning. 
 
§ 2. The intention of this Medicine 
is to be used as a general Vehicle 
to take many other Medicines 
in, it being much better and pleasanter 
than Beer, Ale, Wine, Water, 
Broaths, or Posset-drinks. 
 
§ 3. However it is good against 
Poyson, the biting of Venemous 
Creatures; and is many times used 
to quench thirst in Violent, Continual, 
and Burning, or Malignant 
Fevers, where other Liquors being 
given would be prejudicial. Dose 
+o ij. ad vj. 
 
[}XXXIV. * Aqua Lactis Cardiaca, 
A Cordial Milk-water.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Sweet-scented Apples 
(as Pippins and Pearmains) with 
their peels and kernels lb xij. Bawm, 
Scordium, ana M.x. Zedoary, Tormentil, 
ana +o viij. new Milk lb x. 
mix and distil S.A. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. It ought to be 
distilled as we have before directed; 
and then you have a pleasant 
Cordial Water to be used as a Vehicle 
to give any Cordial Medicines 
in, against fainting Fits, Palpitation 
of the Heart, Swooning, 
and other Distempers of the Præcordia. 
 
§ 2. Thus: +R Of this Water 
a~ +o ij. ad iv. plus minus, Cinamon-water 
+o iij. Tincture of Coral +Q i. 
Confectio Alkermes +q ij. Syrup of 
Clove-gilliflowers, q. s.mix for a 
Cordial Draught. 
 
§ 3. If to the Composition you 
add Angelica, Borrage, Bugloss, ana 
M.vj. Cucumbers (if in season) 
lb j. the Water will be much more 
Cordial and Pleasant. 
 
§ 4. Besides, it will be an excellent 
Antiscorbutick; and may 
be given to Children in the Gripes, 
and vehement Torsions, of the 
Guts, Convulsions, Consumptions, 
Rickets, &c. 
 
[^p.18^] 
[}XXXV. * Aqua Lactis Nephritica, 
Nephritick Milk-water.}] 
 
Bate.]+R Leaves of Althæa, 
Pellitory of the Wall, Cleavers, ana 
M. iv. Roots of Althæa +o xij. Liquorice 
+o iij. of White Saxifrage +o iv. 
new Milk lb xij. mix and distil, 
S.A. Or thus: +R Whites of 
Eggs, with the shells, (the yolks 
being taken away) N=o= xxiv. beat 
them well together, then add Milk 
warm from the Cow lb viij. mix and 
distil according to Art, with a gentle 
fire. Dose half a Pint every 
Morning, for fifteen or twenty 
days; and afterwards once or twice 
a Month, or for two or three days 
together, about the New and Full 
Moons. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. This is chiefly 
to be used as a Vehicle to convey 
other Nephritick Medicines in, after 
this manner: +R Of this Water 
a~ +o iv. ad viij. Oleum Tartari per 
deliquium +o iij. Pouder of Winter-Cherries 
+q j. mix for a Dose. 
 
§ 2. This Water ought to be 
distilled in a Glass Body in BM. and 
then you may distil to dryness, otherwise 
it is impossible to avoid 
an Empyreuma. 
 
§ 3. If to either of the Prescripts 
you add, Parsly M. viij. Biting 
Arsmart, M. vij. Winter-cherries 
lb j. Daucus-seeds, Onion-seeds, 
ana +o vj. and then distil as directed, 
the Medicament will be the 
more powerful to the designed 
Intention. 
 
§ 4. Also it would be good 
after distillation, to put into the 
Water the Ashes of the Feces, 
well calcin'd, for thereby the saline 
parts of the Ingredients will 
be communicated thereto, which 
otherwise it would want. 
 
[}XXXVI. * Aqua Lactis Pectoralis, 
A Pectoral Milk-water.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Garden Snails bruised 
lb j. Hogs-blood lb ij. Maiden-hair, 
Ground-Ivy, ana M. iij. Harts-tongue, 
M. ij. Liquorice, Aniseeds, ana +o iij. 
Jujubs, Raisons, ana +o iv. Milk 
warm from the Cow, lb xij. mix and 
distil S.A. It is a good Pulmonick, 
profitable against the Phthisick, 
Consumption, Pining, &c. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. In my opinion, 
if Sal Armoniack +o vj. be added 
and dissolved in the Milk and Hogs-blood, 
and then distilled, it will be 
much more powerful to the purpose 
intended. 
 
§ 2. It is good against Coughs, 
Colds, Obstructions of the Lungs, 
Shortness of Breath, and other 
Diseases of those parts. 
 
§ 3. You may give it from an 
Ounce to +o iij. especially mixt with 
some pectoral Syrup; and is used 
as a Vehiculum to convey any Pectoral 
Medicine down the Throat 
in. 
 
§ 4. Or it may be prescribed 
thus: +R Of this Water +o iij. Syrup 
of Violets +o i+s. Spirit of Hartshorn, 
gut 25. mix for a Dose, to 
be given in the Paroxysm, and at 
other times, Morning and Evening. 
 
[}XXXVII. * Aqua Lactis Scorbutica, 
Milk-water against the Scurvy.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Sea Scurvy-grass, 
greater Housleek, ana M. xij. Water-cresses, 
[^p.19^] 
Brook-lime, Grass, ana M. vj. 
Chervil M. iv. Milk warm from the 
Cow lb xij. mix and distil S.A. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. Distil in a Glass 
Body in BM. The Title shews 
the use: Dose +o iv. or more at a 
time, every Morning fasting. 
 
§ 2. But its chief design is 
to be a Vehicle to convey other 
Antiscorbutick Medicines in. 
 
§ 3. One of the greatest Antiscorbuticks 
in the Republick of 
Medicine is the greater Plantane, 
and not inferior to that, is our 
common Cucumber, and therefore 
they ought to be added to the 
Composition. 
 
§ 4. You may take Plantane 
M. viij. Cucumbers lb iij. Winter-cherries 
lb j. Horse-Radishes scraped 
+o iij. which mix with the other Ingredients. 
 
[}XXXVIII. Aqua Lamii Composita, 
Water of Dead Nettles 
Compound.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Flowers of the White 
Arch-Angel M.x. Comfrey M. viij. 
Clary M. iv. Dates N=o= 24. Nutmegs 
+o iij. Cassia Ligna +o j. Wine and Milk, 
ana lb vj. mix and distil to driness. 
It is used in the over-flowing or 
flux of the Whites in Women; 
Dose +o iv. at a time. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. If you distil to 
driness, you must do it in a double 
Vessel, to avoid burning. 
 
§ 2. And if to every quart of 
Water you add +o ij. of the best 
Catechu in fine pouder, it will be 
much more powerful to the end 
designed. 
 
§ 3. The Water will extract a 
good Tincture from the Earth and 
make it an excellent Medicine 
against the over-flowing of the 
Terms also, or any inward Flux of 
Blood, spitting of Blood, pissing 
Blood, &c. 
 
§ 4. Whereby it will be prevalent 
against Consumptions, Phthisicks, 
violent Coughs, Catarrhs, or 
any Flux of Humours. 
 
§ 5. The Tincture may be given 
ab +o j. ad +o iij. at Night going 
to Bed in a Draught of Ale. 
 
[}XXXIX. * Aqua Melluminata, Honeyed-water 
Alumed.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Leaves of Oak, Ribwort, 
Bramble, Straw-berries, Cinque-foil, 
Bugloss, Yarrow, Woodbine, 
Sage, Rosemary, red Roses, ana M. ij. 
Chips of Guajacum +o iv. Rhodium 
+o ij. Roots of Bistort +o j. Sulphur 
Vive +o i+s. Vitriol +o j. Alum +o iv. 
Honey lb ss. Water lb viij. boil to the 
consumption of one half, strain, and 
the fæces being settled, you may keep 
it for a year. It is used with Oyl 
of Sulphur, for to cure Ulcers of 
the Mouth and Gums: with Flowers 
of Nitre it is the best Remedy 
against Pustules. 
 
Salmon. § 1. Besides what the 
Author has prescribed it for, it is 
a most excellent thing against all 
manner of Tettars, Ring-worms, 
Herpes, or other like breaking 
out, proceeding from a virulent, 
salt and sharp Humour. 
 
§ 2. But this you must observe 
in the use of it, that the Patient 
must Bathe with it for a quarter 
of an hour, or more, at a time, as 
hot as they can endure it, else it 
will not so effectually answer the 
intention. 
 
[^p.20^] 
[}XL. Aqua Mercurialis, Water of 
Mercury sublimate.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Roots of White Lillies 
+Q ij. Spring-water, q.s. boil 
and strain to lb j. of which add, 
bitter Almonds blanched +Q ij. make 
an Emulsion. In this dissolve (by 
grinding in a Glass Mortar) Mercury 
sublimate +Q ij. and make a most 
White Water, S.A. It takes away 
redess and pustules in the Face, for 
which it is a most certain Cure: 
touch the places often with the Water, 
drop by drop at a time, and 
drying it always with a Rag. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. This Water 
seems to whiten at first, and without 
doubt it is of good use, if 
wisely used, to take away the defilements 
of the skin. 
 
§ 2. But it ought to be used 
with caution and discretion, and 
not for a constancy, least the infinitely 
small particles of the Mercury 
should by degrees, in length 
of time, insinuate themselves into 
the flesh, and in process of the use 
corrupt the Bone. 
 
§ 3. For an ordinary use, and 
with much less danger, the Water 
of the Gryphs Mercurii is much better 
to be used, which is thus made: 
 
§ 4. +R Sublimate +o j. in fine pouder: 
Water boiling hot lb iv. put the 
Water upon the Mercury, in a Whiteware 
Bason, and dissolve; or dissolve by 
boiling in an earthen Pipkin: then 
precipitate with Oleum Tartari per 
deliquium: the Mercury being fallen, 
decant the Water for use. 
 
§ 5. It is admirable to wash 
any old Sore or running Ulcer 
withal, and to bring it to a speedy 
healing; and to cleanse and 
beautify the skin, and take away 
the deformities thereof. 
 
[}XLI. Aqua Odorifera, Sweet, or 
Perfumed Water.}] 
 
Bate.] +R Oranges and Limons, 
ana N=o= vj. Roots of Florentine, Orrice, 
white Sanders, Cinnamon, ana 
+o ij. Mace, Cloves, ana +Q vj. Flowers 
of Lavender, M. iv. of Roman 
Camomil and Rosemary, ana M. ij. 
Leaves of Marjoram M. ij. Basil M. iij. 
Styrax Calamit, +o iij. Benjamin 
+Q v. Damask Roses M. xv. round Cyperus 
+o ss. Fountain-water lb xxx. distil 
all in an Alembick according to 
Art, drawing off only the first lb xv. 
to every pint of which add (tied 
up in a Nodule) the best Musk, 
gr. ij. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. The Musk ought 
to be mixt with a third part of a 
Volatile Sulphur, such as is in that 
of Civit, to open its Body, adding 
a few drops of Juice of Limons, to 
make it exert its odour more powerfully, 
thus: 
 
§ 2. +R Musk. gr. ix. Civit gr. 
iij. grind them together on a Stone 
or in a small glass Mortar, to which 
add Juice of Limons gut. iij. or 
iv. 
 
§ 3. This being put in a Nodule, 
will sweeten or perfume 
twice the quantity of Water that 
the Musk will do alone: and will 
make almost an incredible Odour. 
 
§ 4. The Water it self is used 
as a Perfume, or it may be used 
in place of Rose-water. 
 
§ 5. And is a most excellent 
Vehicle to make any Cordial Julep 
[^p.21^] 
up withal, for it admirably 
comforts and recreates the Animal 
Spirits. 
 
[}XLII. * Aqua Omnium Florum, All 
Flower-water.}] 
 
Bate.] It is made of Cows-dung 
gathered in May, adding to it a 
third of White-wine, and then distilled. 
Or thus: +R Fresh Cows-dung, 
Snails with their Shells bruised, 
ana, mix and distil in a common 
Still. This Water is said to be 
good against the Gout, running 
Gout, Rheumatism, Stone, Stoppage 
of Urine, &c. being very effectual: 
Dose +o iv. at a time. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. This is a Water 
of general tendency, being a 
Spirit extracted from the Sulphur 
of Plants in general. 
 
§ 2. It is not only good against 
the afore-named Disease, but a 
most excellent thing against the 
Scurvy in particular, as also against 
the Palsy, and other Distempers 
of the Nerves, Blood, and Humours. 
 
§ 3. There was a certain Woman, 
who from the most obscure 
Fortune set up for a Doctress, and 
undertook the Cure of all Diseases 
with this only Remedy, or rather 
the same worse made; and 
from the state of a Beggar became 
Mistress ofmore than Twenty thousand 
pounds. 
 
§ 4. This she gave in all Distempers 
and against all Diseases; 
and so happy and successful she 
was, that she cured almost all 
such who were given over by others 
for uncurable, and it was rare 
that any thing came under her 
hands that miscarried. 
 
§ 5. This was her Catholicon, 
this her excellent secret, by which 
she did such wonders in the Art 
of Physick: +R Fresh Cows-dung 
gathered in the morning, lb xij. 
Spring or River-water lb xxx. mix 
and digest twenty four hours; let 
it settle, and then decant the clear 
brown Tincture. 
 
§ 6. It is without doubt a 
good thing, and so much the 
better, because of its general 
tendency, and being constantly 
used with such an approved 
success. 
 
§ 7. By reason it is extracted 
from Cows-dung, it has a pretty 
kind of sweet scent, as if it 
was perfumed with Musk, or 
some other odoriferous thing. 
 
§ 8. Her usual proportions 
and way of giving it was thus: 
She ordered the Patient to take 
about five or six Ounces in the 
Morning fasting, and last at Night 
going to Bed; and if the Disease 
was rebellious or stubborn, as much 
half an hour, or an hour before 
Dinner. 
 
§ 9. And if there was any external 
affect, to Bathe the part 
two or three times a day therewith 
very hot, for a quarter of an 
hour at a time. 
 
§ 10. By this only, and alone 
thing and method, she did even 
almost incredible things. 'Tis 
true, the Medicine is but a 
mean thing, but not to be despised. 
 
[^p.22^] 
[}XLIII. Aqua Opthalmica, Eye-Water.}] 
 
Bate.] It is made of the Water 
from Gum Gujacum, distilled by 
Retort in Ashes, mixt with Brick-dust, 
with a moderate Fire; the 
Oyl being separated, and the Water 
being rectified, and mixed with 
white Rose-water, S.A. It is a most 
excellent Remedy in Diseases of the 
Eyes. 
 
Salmon.] § 1. This is the acid 
Water of the Gum, which being 
rectified is to be mixed with its 
equal weight or quantity of the 
Rose-water, or double or tripple 
quantity, according as the Patient 
is less able to endure the pain 
and smarting. 
 
§ 2. And with which the Eyes 
are to be washed two, three, or 
four times a day, and at Night 
going to bed, after washing, a little 
Virgin-honey is to be put into 
them. 
 
§ 3. It will be good to dissolve 
in this flegm of Gum Guajaci, 
Roch Alum, in every pint of the 
Water, of the Alum +Q ij. and of 
White Vitriol +Q +s. by which it will 
be made more effectual. 
 
§ 4. These things being dissolved 
in it, it is to settle for fourteen 
days, and then to be easily 
decanted from the feces, and 
filtered through brown Paper; 
and so to stand again to settle, and 
be decanted, that all the Terrene 
Particles may be perfectly separated, 
and the Water becomes 
purely clear; and then it will 
be an admirable thing indeed. 
 
§ 5. It may be used three, four, 
or five times a day, as you see the 
vehemency of the Distemper requires; 
it strengthens the part, and 
stops all sorts of defluxions into 
the same.
