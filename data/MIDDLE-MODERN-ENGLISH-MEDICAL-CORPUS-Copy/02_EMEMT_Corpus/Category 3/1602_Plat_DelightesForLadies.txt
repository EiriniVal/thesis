[}Secrets in Distillation.}] 
 
[}1. How to make true spirit of 
wine.}] 
 
TAke the finest Paper you can 
get, or else some Virgine 
parchment, strayne it verie 
right and stiffe ouer the glasse bodie, 
wherein you put your sacke, 
malmsie or muskadine, oyle the 
paper or virgin parchment with a 
pensil moistned in the oile of Ben, 
and distill it in the Balneo with a 
gentle fire, and by this means you 
shall purchase only the true spirit 
of wine. You shall not haue aboue 
two or three ounces at the moste 
out of a gallon of wine, which ascendeth 
in the forme of a cloude, 
without any dewe or veins in the 
[^f.E2r^] 
helme, lute all the ioyntes well in 
this distillation. This spirit will 
vanish in the ayre, if the glasse 
stand open. 
 
[}2. Howe to make the ordinarie spirit of 
wine that is solde for 5. shillings, & 
a noble, a pinte.}] 
 
PVt sacke, malmesie, or muskadine 
into a glasse bodie, leauing 
one thirde or more of your 
glasse empty, set it in balneo, or 
in a pan of ashes, keeping a softe 
and gentle fire, drawe no longer 
then till all or most part wil burne 
away, which you may proue nowe 
and then, by setting a spoonefull 
thereof on fire with a paper as it 
droppeth from the nose or pipe of 
the helme, and if your spirit thus 
drawn haue any phlegme therin, 
the~ rectify or redistil y=e= spirit again 
in a lesser body, or in a bolt receiuer 
in sted of an other body, luting 
a small head on the top of the steel 
[^f.E2v^] 
thereof, and so you shall haue a verie 
strong spirit, or else for more 
expedition, distill fiue or sixe gallons 
of wine by a Limbecke, and 
that spirit which ascendeth afterward, 
redistil in glasse as before. 
 
[}3. Spirits of Spices.}] 
 
DIstill with a gentle heat either 
in balneo, or ashes, the strong 
and sweete water, wherewith you 
haue drawen oile of cloues, mace, 
nutmegs, Iuniper, Rosemarie, &c. 
after it hath stoode one moneth 
close stopt, and so you shall purchase 
a most delicate Spirite of 
each of the saide aromaticall bodies. 
 
[}4. Spirit of wine tasting of what vegetable 
you please.}] 
 
MAcerate Rosemarie, Sage, 
sweet fennell seedes, Marierom, 
Le~mon or Orenge pils, &c. 
[^f.E3r^] 
in spirit of wine a day or two, and 
then distill it ouer againe, vnlesse 
you had rather haue it in his proper 
colour: for so you shall haue it 
vpon the first infusion without any 
farther distillation, and some 
young Alchimists doe holde these 
for the true spirits of vegetables. 
 
[}5. How to make the water which is vsually 
called Balmewater.}] 
 
TO euery gallon of claret wine, 
put one pound of green balm 
Keep that which commeth first & 
is clearest, by it selfe: and the second 
& whiter sort which is weakest, 
and commeth last, by it selfe, 
distill in a pewter limbecke luted 
with paste to a brasse pot. Drawe 
this in May or Iune whe~ the herb 
is in his prime. 
 
[}6. Rosa-solis.}] 
 
TAke of the hearbe Rosa-solis, 
gathered in Iuly one gallon, 
[^f.E3v^] 
pick out all the black moats from 
the leaues, dates halfe a pounde, 
Cinamon, Ginger, cloues, of each 
one ounce, graines half an ounce, 
fine sugar a pound and a halfe, red 
rose leaues, greene or dryed foure 
handfuls, steepe all these in a gallon 
of good Aqua Composita in 
a glasse close stopped with waxe, 
during twentie daies, shake it wel 
together once euerie two daies. 
Your sugar must be powdred, your 
spices brused onely, or grosselie 
beaten, your dates cut in long slices 
the stones taken awaie. If you 
adde two or three graines of Amber 
greece, and as much muske 
in your glasse amongst the rest of 
the ingredientes, it will haue a 
pleasant smel. Some adde the gum 
amber with coral and pearl finely 
poudred, and fine leafe golde. 
Some vse to boyle Ferdinando 
bucke in Rosewater, till they haue 
purchased a faire deepe crimson 
colour, and when the same is cold, 
[^f.E4r^] 
they colour their Rosa-solis and 
Aqua Rubea therewith. 
 
[}7. Aqua Rubea.}] 
 
TAke of muske sixe graines, of 
Cinamon and ginger of each 
one ounce, white sugar candy one 
pounde, pouder the sugar, and 
bruse the spices grossely, binde 
them vp in a cleane linnen cloth, 
and put them to infuse in a gallon 
of Aqua co~posita in glasse close 
stopped twentie foure houres, shaking 
them togither diuers times, 
then put thereto of turnesole one 
dram, suffer it to stand one houre, 
and then shake al together, then if 
the colour like you after it is setled, 
poure the cleerest forth into 
an other glasse: but if you wil haue 
it deeper coloured, suffer it to 
worke longer vppon the turnesole. 
 
[^f.E4v^] 
[}8. Steeuens Aqua composita.}] 
 
TAke a gallo~ of Gascoign wine, 
of ginger, galingale, cinamo~, 
nutmegs & graines, Annis seeds, 
fennel seeds, and carroway seeds, 
of each a dram, of Sage, mints, red 
Roses, Time, Pellitorie, Rosemary, 
wild thime, camomil, lauender, of 
each a handfull, braie the spices 
small, and bruise the herbs, letting 
them macerate 12. houres, stirring 
it now and then, then distill 
by a limbecke of pewter, keeping 
the first cleare water that co~meth 
by it self, & so likewise the second. 
You shal draw much about a pinte 
of the better sort from euery gallon 
of wine. 
 
[}9. Vsquebath, or Irish aqua vitæ.}] 
 
TO euery gallon of good Aqua 
composita, put two ounces of 
[^f.E5r^] 
chosen liquerice bruised, and cut 
into small peeces, but first clensed 
from all his filth, and two ounces 
of Annis seeds that are cleane & 
bruised, let them macerate fiue or 
sixe daies in a wodden Vessel, stopping 
the same close, and then draw 
off as much as will runne cleere, 
dissoluing in that cleare Aqua vitæ 
fiue or six spoonfuls of the best 
Malassoes you can get, Spanish 
cute if you can get it, is thought 
better then Malassoes, then put 
this into another vessell; and after 
three or foure daies (the more the 
better) when the liquor hath fined 
it self, you may vse the same: some 
adde Dates & Raisons of the sun 
to this receipt; those groundes 
which remaine you may redistill 
and make more Aqua composita 
of them, & of that Aqua co~posita 
you may make more Vsque bath. 
 
[^f.E5v^] 
[}10. Cinamon water.}] 
 
HAuing a Copper bodie or 
brasse pot that will holde 12. 
gallons, you may well make 2. or 
3. gallons of Cinamon water at 
once. Put into your body ouernight 
6. gallons of conduit water, 
and two gallons of spirit of wine, 
or to saue charge two gallons of 
spirit drawne from wine lees, Ale, 
or lowe wine, or sixe pound of the 
best and largest Cinamon you can 
get, or else eight pound of the second 
sort wel brused, but not beaten 
into pouder: lute your Lymbeck, 
& begin with a good fire of 
wood & coals, till the vessel begin 
to distil, then moderate your fire, 
so as your pipe may drop apace, 
and run trickling into the receiuer, 
but not blow at anie time: it 
helpeth much heerein to keep the 
water in the bucket, not too hot, 
by often change thereof, it must 
[^f.E6r^] 
neuer be so hot but that you may 
well indure your finger therein. 
Then diuide into quart Glasses 
the spirit vvhich first ascendeth, 
and vvherein you finde either no 
taste or a very small taste of the 
Cynamon, then may you boldely 
after the spirit once beginneth to 
come strong of the cinamo~, draw 
vntill you haue gotten at the least 
a Gallon in the receiuer, and 
then diuide often by halfe pintes 
and quarters of pintes, least you 
drawe too long: which you shall 
knowe by the faynte taste and 
milky coulour which distilleth 
in the ende: this you must nowe 
and then taste in a spoone. Now, 
when you haue drawen so much 
as you finde good, you may adde 
thereunto so much of your spirit 
that came before your Cinamon 
water, as the same will well beare: 
which you must find by your taste. 
But if your spirit and your Cinamo~ 
be both good, you may of the 
[^f.E6v^] 
aforesaid proportion wil make vp 
two gallons, or two gallons and a 
quarte of good Cinamon water. 
Heere note that it is not amisse to 
obserue which glasse was first filled 
with the Spirit that ascended, 
and so of the second, thirde, and 
fourth: and when you mix, begin 
with the last glasse first, & so with 
the next, because those haue 
more taste of the Cinamon then 
that which came first, and therefore 
more fit to bee mixed with 
your Cinamon water. And if you 
meane to make but 8. or 9 pintes 
at once, then begin but with the 
halfe of this proportion. Also that 
spirit which remaineth vnmixed 
doth serue to make Cinamon water 
the second time. This way I 
haue often proued & found most 
excellent: take heede that your 
Limbecke be cleane and haue no 
maner of sent in it, but of wine or 
Cinamon, and so likewise of the 
glasses, funnelles and pots which 
[^f.E7r^] 
you shall vse about this worke. 
 
[}11. How to distill Isop, thime, lauender, 
Rosemary, &c. after a new and excellent 
manner.}] 
 
HAuing a large Pot containing 
12. or 14 gallons, with a Limbecke 
to it, or else a copper body 
with a serpentine of 20 or 24. gallons, 
and a copper heade, beeing 
such a vessell as is commonly vsed 
in the drawing of Aqua vitæ, fill 
two partes thereof with faire water, 
and one other thirde part 
with such hearbes as you woulde 
distill, the hearbes being eyther 
moist or drie it skilleth not greatly 
whether, let the hearbes macerate 
all night, and in the morning 
begin your fire, then distil as before 
in Cinamon water, beeing 
carefull to giue change of waters 
to your colour alwaies as it needeth: 
drawe no longer then you 
feele a strong and sensible taste of 
[^f.E7v^] 
y=e= hearb which you distill, alwayes 
diuiding the stronger from the 
weaker, and by this meanes you 
shall purchase a water farre excelling 
any that is drawen by a common 
pewter still: you may also gather 
the oyle of each hearb which 
you shall finde fleeting on the top 
or summity of your water. This 
course agreeth best with such 
herbs as are not in taste, and will 
yeeld their oile by distillation. 
 
[}12 How to make the salt of hearbs.}] 
 
BVrne whole bundles of dryed 
Rosemary, Sage, Isop, &c; in a 
cleane ouen, and when you haue 
gathered good store of the ashes 
of the hearb, infuse warme water 
vpon them, making a strong and 
sharpe Lee of those ashes, then euaporate 
that Lee, & the reside~ce 
or setling which you finde in the 
botto~ therof, is the salt which you 
seek for. Some vse to filter this lee 
[^f.E8r^] 
diuers times before euaporation, 
that their salt may be the clearer 
and more transpare~t. This salt according 
to the nature of the hearb 
hath great effects in physicke. 
 
[}13. Spirit of hony.}] 
 
PVt one part of honey to 5. parts 
of water, when the water boileth, 
dissolue your honey therein, 
skimme it, and hauing sodden an 
houre or two, put it into a wodden 
vessell, and when it is but bloud 
warme, set it on worke with yeaste 
after the vsuall manner of Beere 
and Ale, tun it, and when it hath 
lyen some time, it will yeelde his 
spirit by distillation; as wine, beer 
and ale will do. 
 
[}14. To distil Rosewater at Michaelmas 
and to haue a good yeeld as at any other 
time of the yeare.}] 
 
[^f.E8v^] 
IN the pulling of your Roses, first 
diuide all the blasted leaues, the~ 
take the other fresh leaues, and 
lay them abroad vpon your table 
or windowes with some cleane 
linnen vnder them, let them ly 3. 
or foure houres, or if they bee 
dewy vntil the dewe be fully vanished, 
put these rose leaues in great 
stone pottes, hauing narrowe 
mouthes, and well leaded within, 
(such as the Goldfiners call their 
hookers, & serue to receiue their 
Aqua fortis, bee the best of all others 
that I know) and when they 
are well filled, stop their mouthes 
with good corkes, eyther couered 
all ouer with waxe or molten 
brimstone, and then set your pot 
in some coole place, and they wil 
keepe a long time good, and you 
may distill them at your best leasure. 
This waie you may distill 
Rosewater good cheape, if you 
buy store of Roses, when you find 
a glutte of them in the market, 
[^f.E9r^] 
wherby they are solde for 7. pence 
or 8. pence the bushell, you then 
engrosse the flower. And some 
hold opinion, that if in the midst 
of these leaues you put some broken 
leauen, and after fill vp the 
pot with Rose leaues to the top, 
that so in your distillatio~ of them 
you shal haue a perfect Rose vinegar 
without the addition of anie 
common vinegar. I haue knowen 
Reseleaues kept well in Rondlets, 
that haue been first well seasoned 
with some hote liquor and Rose-leaues 
boiled togither, and the 
same pitched ouer on the out side, 
so as no aire might penetrate or 
pearce the vessell. 
 
[}15. A speedy distillation of Rosewater.}] 
 
STampe the leaues, and first distill 
the iuice being expressed, 
and after distil the leaues, and so 
you shall dispatch more with one 
Stil, then others do with three or 
[^f.E9v^] 
foure stils. And this water is euerie 
way as medicinable as the other, 
seruing in all sirrups, decoctions, 
&c. sufficiently, but not altogether 
so pleasing in smell. 
 
[}16. How to distill wine vinegar or good 
Aligar, that it may bee both clear & 
sharpe.}] 
 
I Knowe it is an vsuall manner among 
the Nouices of our time 
to put a quart or two of good vinegar 
into an ordinary leade~ still, 
and so to distill it as they do all other 
waters. But this way I do vtterly 
dislike, both for that heere is no 
seperation made at all, and also 
because I feare that the Vinegar 
doth cary an ill touch with it, either 
fro~ the leaden botto~ or pewter 
head or both. And therefore 
I coulde wish rather that the same 
were distilled in a large bodie of 
glasse with a head or receiuer, the 
same being placed in sande or ashes. 
[^f.E10r^] 
Note that the best part of the 
vinegar is the middle part that ariseth, 
for the first is fainte and 
phlegmatick, and the last wil taste 
of adustion, because it groweth 
heauie toward the latter end, and 
must be vrged vp with a great fire, 
and therefore you must nowe and 
then taste of that which commeth 
both in the beginning & towards 
the latter end, that you may receiue 
the best by it selfe. 
 
[}17. How to draw the true spirit of roses, 
and so of all other hearbs and flowers.}] 
 
MAcerate the Rose in his own 
iuice, adding thereunto being 
te~perately warm, a conuenie~t 
proportion either of yeast or ferment, 
leaue the~ a few daies in fermentation, 
till they haue gotten a 
stro~g & heady smel, beginning to 
incline toward vinegar, the~ distill 
them in balneo in glass bodies luted 
to their helms (happily a limbecke 
[^f.E10v^] 
wil do better and rid faster) 
and drawe so long as you find any 
sent of the Rose to come, then re-distill 
or rectifie the same so often 
till you haue purchased a perfect 
spirit of the Rose. You may also 
ferment the iuice of Roses onelie, 
and after distill the same. 
 
[}18. An excellent Rosewater.}] 
 
VPon the top of your glasse bodie, 
straine a haire cloth, and 
vpon that lay good store or Rose-leaues, 
either drie, or halfe drie, 
and so your water will ascend verie 
good both in smell and in colour. 
Distill either in balneo, or in 
a gentle fire in ashes, you may reiterate 
the same water vppon fresh 
leaues. This may also be done in 
a leaden Still, ouer which by reason 
of the breadth you may place 
more leaues. 
 
[^f.E11r^] 
[}19. An excellent way to make the extract 
of all Vegetables.}] 
 
EXpresse a good quantity of the 
iuice thereof, set it on the fire, 
and giue it onely a walme or two, 
then it will grow cleere: before it 
be cooled, pour away the cleerest, 
filter with a peece of cotton, and 
then euaporate your filtred iuyce, 
till it come to a thicke substance, 
and thus you shal haue a most excellent 
extracte of the Rose, Gilloflower, 
&c. with the perfect sent 
and taste of the flower, whereas 
the common waie is to make the 
extracte eyther by spirit of wine 
faire water, the water of the plant, 
or some kind of menstruum. 
 
[}20. To make a water smelling of the Eglantine, 
Gilloflowers, &c.}] 
 
DRie the hearbe or flower, and 
distill the same in faire water 
[^f.E11v^] 
in a limbecke, draw no longer the~ 
you find sent in the water that issueth, 
reiterate that water vpon 
fresh herbes, and distil as before, 
deuiding the sweetest fro~ the rest. 
 
[}21. A Skottish handwater.}] 
 
PVt thyme, Lauender, and Rosemary 
confusedly together, the~ 
make a lay of thicke wine Lees in 
the bottom of a stone pot, vppon 
which make an other laye of the 
said hearbes, & then a lay of Lees, 
and so forwarde, lute the pot wel, 
bury it in the ground for 6. weeks, 
distill it, & it is called Dames water 
in Scotland. A little therof put 
into a bason of a co~mon water maketh 
very sweet washing water. 
 
[}22. How to draw the bloud of hearbes.}] 
 
STampe the hearb, put the same 
into a large glasse, leauing two 
parts emptie (some commend the 
[^f.E12r^] 
iuice of the hearbe onely) nip or 
else lute the glasse very wel, digest 
it in balneo .15. or 16. daies, and 
you shall finde the same very red, 
diuide the watrish part, and that 
which remaineth is the bloud or 
essence of the hearb. 
 
[}23. Rosewater, and yet the Roseleaues 
not discoloured.}] 
 
YOu must distill in balneo, and 
whe~ the bottom of your pewter 
Still is through hotte, put in a 
fewe leaues at once and distill 
them: watch your Still carefully, 
and as soone as those are distilled 
put in more. I know not whether 
your profit will requite your labour, 
yet accept of it as a newe 
conclusion. 
 
[}24. How to recouer Rosewater, or any 
other distilled water that hath gotten 
a mother, and is in daunger to 
be musty.}] 
 
[^f.E12v^] 
INfuse your water vpo~ fresh Rose 
leaues, or vpon Rose cakes broken 
all in peeces, and then after 
maceration for three or foure 
houres with a gentle fire, redistill 
your water. Do this in a Limbeck, 
take heed of drawing too long for 
burning, vnlesse your Limbecke 
stand in balneo. 
 
[}25. To drawe both good Rosewater, and 
oyle of Roses together.}] 
 
AFter you haue digested your 
Rose leaues by the space of 3. 
moneths, sicut ante, num. 13. eyther 
in barrels or hookers, then distill 
the~ with faire water in a limbeck, 
draw so long as you finde anie excellent 
smell of the Rose, then diuide 
the fatty oile that fleeteth on 
the top of the Rose water, and so 
you haue both excellent oile of 
Roses, and also good Rosewater 
togither, and you shall also haue 
more water then by the ordinarie 
[^f.F1r^] 
way, and this Rosewater extendeth 
farther in physicall compositions, 
and the other serueth best 
for perfumes and casting bottles. 
You may also distill the oyle of 
Lignum Rhodium this way, sauing 
that you shall not neede to macerate 
the same aboue 24 houres in 
your water or menstruum before 
you distill: this oyle hath a 
most pleasing smell in a 
manner equall with 
the oyle of 
Roses.

Aprill, with a receiuer of glasse set 
vnder the boring thereof to receiue 
the same, doth perform the 
[^f.G9v^] 
same most excellently & maketh 
the skin very cleare. This sap will 
dissolue pearl, a secret not known 
vnto many. 
 
[}7. A white fucus or beauty for

the face.}] 
 
TAke three pintes of conduit 
water, boyle therein two ounces 
of French barly, change your 
water, and put in the barly again: 
repeate this so long, till your water 
purchase no colour from the 
Barley, but become verie cleare: 
boyle the last three pintes to a 
quart, then mixe halfe a pinte of 
white wine therein, and when it is 
cold, wring the iuyce of two or 
three good Lemmons therein, & 
vse the same for the Morphewe, 
heate of the face or hands, and to 
cleere the skinne. 
 
[}12. Skinne kept white 
and cleare.}] 
 
WAsh the face and body of a 
sucking child with breast 
milke, or Cowe milke, or mixed 
[^f.G11r^] 
with water, euerie night, and the 
childes skinne will wax faire and 
cleare, and resist sunburning. 
 
[}13. An excellent Pomatum to clear 
the skinne.}] 
 
WAsh Barrowes grease often 
times in May dewe that 
hath bin clarified in the sun, till it 
bee exceeding white, then take 
Marshmallow rootes scraping off 
the outsides, then make thin slices 
of them and mixe them, set 
them to macerate in a seething 
balneo, and scumme it well till it 
bee throughly clarified and will 
come to roap, then straine it, and 
put now and then a spoonefull of 
May-dewe therein, beating it till 
it be through cold in often cha~ge 
of May-dew, then throw away that 
dewe, and put it in a glasse couering 
it with May-dewe, and so reserue 
it to your vse. Let the mallowe 
[^f.G11v^] 
rootes be two or three daies 
dryed in the shade before you vse 
them. This I had of a great professour 
of Arte, and for a rare and 
dainty secret, as the best fucus 
this day in vse. 
 
[}14. Another minerall fucus for 
the face.}] 
 
INcorporate vvith a woodden 
pestle and in a woodden mortar 
with great labour foure ounces 
of sublimate, and one ounce of 
crude Mercury at the least sixe or 
eight houres (you cannot bestowe 
too much labor herein) then with 
often change of colde water by 
ablution in a glasse, take awaie the 
salts from the sublimate, change 
your water twise euery day at the 
least, and in seauen or eight daies 
(the more the better) it will bee 
dulcified, and then it is prepared. 
Lay it on with the oyle of white 
poppey. 
 
[^f.G12r^] 
[}15. To take away chilblanes out of the 
hands or feete.}] 
 
BOyle halfe a pecke of Oates in 
a quart of water, till they waxe 
drie, then hauing first annointed 
your handes with some good Pomatum 
& well chafed them, hold 
them within the oates as hotte as 
you may well suffer them, couering 
the bowle wherein you put 
your handes with a double cloth 
to keep in the steame of the oats. 
Do this three or foure times, and 
you shal finde the effect. The same 
Oates will serue to bee sodden 
with freshe water three or foure 
times. 
 
[}16. To helpe a face that is red 
or pimpled.}] 
 
DIssolue common salte in the 
iuice of Lemmons, and with a 
[^f.G12v^] 
linnen cloth, pat the patients face 
that is full of heate or pimples. It 
cureth in a few dressings. 
 
[}17. Aliter.}] 
 
TAke of those little whelkes or 
shels which some do call giny 
money, wash fiue or sixe of the~, & 
beate them to fine powder, and 
infuse the iuyce of Lemmons vpon 
them, & it will presently boyl: 
but if it offer to boyle out of your 
glasse, then stop the mouth therof 
with your finger, or blow into 
it. This will in a short time bee 
like an ointment, with which you 
must anoint the heate or pimples 
of the face often times in a daye 
till you find helpe. As the ointme~t 
dryeth put more iuyce of Lemmons 
to it. This of an outlandish 
Gentlewoman, and it is an assured 
remedy if the heate bee not very 
extreme. Some haue found by experience, 
[^f. H1r^] 
that bathing of the face 
with hote vinegar euery night 
when they go to bed doth mightily 
repell the humour. 
 
[}18. Aliter.}] 
 
QVilt baye salte well dryed and 
powdered, in double linnen 
sockes of a prettie bignesse, let the 
patient weare them in wide hose 
and shooes day and night, by the 
space of fourteene dayes, or till he 
be well, euery morning and euening 
let him drie his sockes by 
the fire and put them on againe. 
This helped M. Foster an Essex ma~ 
and an Atturney of the Common 
pleas within these few yeares, but 
now deceased, whose face was for 
many yeares together of an exceedinge 
highe and firye colour, 
of my owne knowledge, and had 
spent much money in Physicke 
without anie successe at all, vntill 
[^f.H1v^] 
he obtained his remedie. The patient 
must not take any wet of his 
feete during the cure. 
 
[}19. Aliter & optime.}] 
 
TAke halfe a pound of white distilled 
vinegar, two newe laid 
Egges with their shelles, two 
spoonfuls of the flowers of brimstone, 
let these macerate in the 
vinegar by the space of three 
dayes: then take out the Egges, 
and pricke them ful of holes with 
a needle, but not too deepe, least 
any of the yolke shoulde happen 
also to issue, let that liquor also 
mixe with the vinegar, then 
straine all through a fine cloath, 
and tye vp the brimstone in the 
cloth like a little ball, dippe this 
ball in the strained liquor, when 
you vse it, and pat it on the place 
three or foure times euerie daye, 
[^f.H2r^] 
and this will cure any red face in 
twelue or fourteene dayes. Some 
do also commende the same for 
an approued remedie against the 
morphew; the brimstone bal must 
be kept in some close thing from 
the ayre. 
 
[}20. How to take away any pimple from 
the face.}] 
 
BRimston ground with the oyl 
of Turpentine, and applied to 
any pimple one houre, maketh 
the flesh to rise spungeous, which 
being annointed with the thicke 
oyle or butter that ariseth in the 
morning from new milke sodden 
a little ouer night, will heale and 
scale away in a fewe daies, leauing 
a faire skinne behinde. This is 
a good skinning salue. 
 
[^f.H2v^] 
[}21. To helpe any Morphew, sunburning, 
itch, or red face.}] 
 
STeepe two sliced Lemmons being 
large and faire in a pinte of 
Conduit water, leaue them foure 
or fiue daies in infusion couering 
the water, then straine the water, 
and dissolue therein the quantitie 
of a hasell nut of sublimate (some 
hold a dramme a good proportion 
to a pinte of water) finely powdered: 
let the patient wet a cloth 
therein, and rub the place where 
the griefe is euery morninge and 
euening a little, till the hew doe 
please her: you may make the 
same stronger or weaker according 
to good discretion. 
 
[}22. For the Morphew.}] 
 
TAke a pinte of distilled vinegar, 
laie therein two newe laid 
[^f.H3r^] 
egges whole with their shelles, 
three yellowe Docke rootes picked 
and sliced, two spoonefulls of 
the flowers of brimstone, and so 
let all rest three daies, and then 
vse this liquor with a cloth, rubbing 
the place three or 4. times 
euerie daye, and in three or foure 
dayes it commonly helpeth: put 
some bran in your cloth before 
you moisten your cloth therein, 
binding it vp in forme of a little 
ball. This of Master Rich of Lee, 
who helped himselfe and a gallant 
Ladie therewith in a few dayes. 
 
[}23. To take away the freckles in 
the face.}] 
 
WAsh your face in the wane 
of the moon with a spunge, 
morninge and euening with the 
distilled water of elder leaues, 
lettinge the same drie into the 
skinne. Your water must bee distilled 
[^f.H3v^] 
in Maie. This is of a Trauailer, 
who hath cured himselfe 
thereby. 
 
[}24. To cure any extreame bruise vpon a 
sore fall, on the face, or any other me~ber 
of the body.}] 
 
PResently after the fall make a 
greate fire, and applie hote 
cloathes one after another without 
intermission, the patient sta~ding 
neere the fire for one houre 
and a halfe, or till the swelling be 
cleane abated. This I knewe proued 
with good successe in a maid 
that fell downe a paire of staires, 
whereby all her face was extremely 
disfigured. Some holde opinion 
that the same may bee perfourmed 
with clothes wet in hote 
water and wroonge out againe 
before application. Then to take 
away the chaungeable colours, 
which doe accustomablie followe 
all bruises, shred the roote of a 
[^f.H4r^] 
greene of growing flower deluce, 
beate it with red rose water, and 
grinde it till it come to a salue, 
apply the same, & in a fewe houres 
it taketh away all the colours: but 
if it lie too long it will rayse pimples, 
and therefore so soone as the 
colours be vanished, immediately 
remooue the salue. 
 
[}25. How to keepe the teeth 
cleane.}] 
 
CAlcine the tops and branches 
of Rosemarie into ashes, and 
to one part thereof, put one part 
of burnt allome, mixe them well 
together, and with thy finger first 
moistened a little with thy spettle, 
rubbe all thy teeth ouer a prettie 
while euerie morning till they be 
cleane, but not to galling of thy 
gums, then sup vp some fair water 
or white wine, gargling the sa~e vp 
& down thy mouth a while, & the~ 
[^f.H4v^] 
drie thy mouth with a towel. This 
of an honest Gentleman and a 
painefull gatherer of physicall receits. 
 
[}26. Sweet and delicate dentifrices or 
Rubbers for the teeth.}] 
 
DIssolue in foure ounces of 
warme water, three or foure 
drammes of gumme Dragagant, 
and in one night this will become 
a thicke substance like gellie, 
mingle the same with the powder 
of Alablaster finely grounde and 
searced, then make vp this substance 
into little round rolles, of 
the bignesse of a childes arrowe, 
& foure or fiue inches in length. 
Also if you temper Roset or some 
other colour (that is not hurtful) 
with them, they wil shew ful of 
pleasing veines. These you may 
sweeten either with Rosewater, 
Ciuet, or muske. But if your teeth 
[^f.H5r^] 
be verie scaly, let some exper 
barbar first take off the scales with 
his instrument, and then you may 
keepe them cleane by rubbing 
them with the aforesaide rolles. 
And heere, by those miserable experiences 
that I haue seene in 
some of my neerest friendes, I am 
inforced to admonish all Gentlewomen 
to be carefull howe they 
suffer their teeth to bee cleansed 
and made white with anie Aqua 
fortis, which is the Barbars vsuall 
water: for vnlesse the same be both 
well delayed, and carefullie applied, 
shee may happen within a fewe 
dressings to be forced to borrow 
a ranke of teeth to eate her dinner, 
vnlesse her gums do helpe her 
the better. 
 
[}27. A delicate stoue to sweat in.}] 
 
I Know that many Gentlewomen 
as well for the clearing of their 
[^f.H5v^] 
skins as cleansing of their bodies, 
do now and then delight to sweat. 
For the which purpose I haue set 
downe this manner following, as 
the best that euer I obserued. Put 
into a brasse pot of some good 
content, such proportion of sweet 
hearbes, and of such kind as shall 
bee most appropriate for your infirmitie, 
with some reasonable 
quantitie of water, close the same 
with an apt couer, and well luted 
with some paste made of flower 
and whites of Egges: at some 
parte of the couer you must let 
in a leaden pipe (the entraunce 
whereof must also bee well luted) 
this pipe must bee conueyed thorough 
the side of the Chimney, 
where the pot standeth in a thicke 
hollow stake, of a bathing tubb 
crossed with hoopes according to 
the vsual manner in the top, which 
you may couer with a sheete at 
your pleasure. Nowe the steame 
of the pot passing thorough the 
[^f.H6r^] 
pipe vnder the false bottome of 
the bathing tub, which must bee 
boared full of bigge holes, will 
breath so sweete and warme a vapour 
vpon your bodie, as that (receiuing 
aire by holding your head 
without the tub as you sit therin) 
you shall sweat most temperately, 
and continue the same a longe 
time without fainting. And this is 
performed with a small charcoale 
fire maintained vnder the pot for 
this purpose. Note that the room 
would be close wherein you place 
your bathing tub, least any sodain 
cold should happen to offend you 
whilest your bodie is made open 
and porous to the aire. 
 
[}28. Diuers sorts of sweet or hand waters 
made sodainly or extempore, with the 
extracted oyles of spices.}] 
 
FIrst you shall vnderstande that 
whensoeuer you shall drawe 
[^f.H6v^] 
any of the aforesaid oyles of Cinamon, 
Cloues, Mace, Nutmegs or 
such like, that you shall haue also 
a pottle, or a gallon more or lesse, 
according to the quantity which 
you drawe at once, of excellent 
sweete washing water for your table, 
yea some do keepe the same 
for their broths, wherein otherwise 
they should vse some of the 
same kind of spice. But if you take 
three or foure drops onely of the 
oyle of Cloues, Mace, or Nutmegs 
(for Cinamon oyle is too 
costly to spend this way) and mingle 
the same with a pinte of faire 
water, making agitation of them 
a prettie while together in a glasse 
hauing a narrowe mouth, till they 
haue in some measure incorporated 
themselues together, you shall 
find a verie pleasing and delightfull 
water to wash with, and so you 
may alwayes furnish your selfe of 
sweete water of seuerall kindes, before 
such time as your guests shal 
[^f.H7r^] 
bee readie to sit downe. I speak not 
here of the oile of spike, which will 
extend verie farre this waye, both 
because euerie gentlewoman doth 
not like so stronge a sent, and for 
that the same is elswhere already 
commended by another Author. 
Yet I must needes acknoweledge 
it to be the cheaper way, for 
that I assure my selfe there may be 
fiue or six gallons of sweete water 
made with one ounce of the 
oile, which you may buy ordinarily 
for a groate at the most. 
 
[}29. An excellent sweet water for a casting 
bottle.}] 
 
TAke three drams of oile of 
Spike, one dramme of oyle of 
Thyme, one dram of oyle of Lemmons, 
one dram of oile of cloues, 
then take one graine of Ciuet, 
and three graines of the aforesaid 
composition well wrought together. 
[^f.H7v^] 
Temper them well in a siluer 
spoone with your finger, then put 
the same into a siluer boll, washing 
it out by little and little into the 
boll with a little Rosewater at 
once, til all the oyle be washed out 
of the spoone into the boule, and 
then doe the like by washing the 
same out of the boule with a little 
Rosewater at once, till all the sent 
be gotten out, putting the Rosewater 
still in a glasse, when you 
haue tempered the same in the 
boule sufficiently. A pinte of Rosewater 
will bee sufficient to mingle 
with the said proportion: and if 
you finde the same not stronge enough 
of the ciuet, then you may 
to euery pinte put one graine and 
a halfe, or two graines of ciuet to 
the weight of three graines of the 
aforesaide composition of oyles. 
 
[}30. To colour a blacke haire presently 
into a Chesnut colour.}] 
 
[^f.H8r^] 
THis is done with oyle of Vitrioll, 
but you must doe it verie 
carefully not touching the skin. 
 
[}31. A present and delicate 
perfume.}] 
 
LAy two or three droppes of liquid 
Amber vpon a glowing 
coale, or a peece of lignum aloes, 
lignum Rhodium, or storax. 
 
[}32. To renew the sent of a 
Pomander.}] 
 
TAke one graine of ciuet, and 
two of muske, or if you double 
the proportion it will bee so 
much the sweeter, grind them vpon 
a stone with a little Rosewater, 
and after wetting your hands with 
Rosewater, you may worke the 
same in your Pomander. This is a 
sleight to passe away an olde Pomander, 
but my intention is honest. 
 
[^f.H8v^] 
[}33. How to gather and clarifie 
May-dewe.}] 
 
VVHen there hath fallen no 
rain the night before, the~ 
with a cleane and large sponge, 
the next morning you may gather 
the same fro~ sweet hearbs, grasse, 
or corne: straine your dewe, and 
expose it to the sunne in glasses 
couered with papers or parchment 
prickt full of holes, strain 
it often, continuing it in the sun, 
and in an hote place till the same 
growe white and cleere, which wil 
require the best parte of the summer. 
Some commend May dewe 
gathered from Fennell and Celandine, 
to be most excellent for 
sore eyes, & some commend the 
same (prepared as before) aboue 
Rosewater for preseruing of fruits 
flowers, &c. 
 
[^f.H9r^] 
[}34. Diuers excellent sentes for gloues, 
with their proportions and other circumstances, 
with the manner of perfuming.}] 
 
THe Violet, the Orenge, the 
Lemmon duely proportioned 
with other sentes, performe this 
well, so likewise of Labdanum, 
Storax, Beniamin, &c. 
 
The manner is this. First lay 
your vmber vpon a few coales till 
it begin to cracke like lime, then 
let it coole of it selfe, taking away 
the coales, then grinde the same 
with some yellowe ocre, till you 
perceiue a right color for a gloue: 
with this mixture wash ouer 
your gloue with a little haire-brush 
vpon a smooth stone in euerie 
seame and all ouer, then hang 
your gloues to drie vppon a line, 
then with gum Dragagant dissolued 
in some Rosewater, & ground 
with a little oyle de Ben, or of 
[^f.H9v^] 
sweet Almonds vpo~ a stone, strike 
ouer your gloues in euerie place 
with the gum and oyle so ground 
together, doe this with a little 
spoonge, but bee sure the gloues 
be first throughly dry, and the colour 
well rubbed and beaten out 
of the gloue; then let them hange 
againe till they be drie, which will 
be in a short time. Then if you will 
haue your gloue to lie smooth and 
faire in shewe, goe ouer it againe 
with your spoonge, and the mixture 
of gumme and oyle, and drie 
the gloue yet once againe. Then 
grinde vppon your stone two or 
three graines of good muske, with 
halfe a spoonefull of Rosewater, 
and with a verie little peece of a 
spoonge take vp the composition 
by a little and little, and so lay it 
vpon your gloue lying vppon the 
stone. Picke and straine your gum 
Dragagant before you vse it. Perfume 
but the one side of your 
gloue at once, and then hang it vp 
[^f.H10r^] 
to drie, and then finish the other 
side. Tenne graines of muske wil 
giue a sufficient perfume to eight 
paire of gloues. Note also that 
this pefume is done vpon a thin 
Lambes leather gloue, and if you 
worke vpon a kids skin or goates 
skin, which is vsuall leather for 
rich perfumes, the~ you must adde 
more quantitie of the oyle of Ben 
to your gumme, and go ouer the 
gloue twise therewith. 
 
[}35. Sweet bags to lie among linnen.}] 
 
FIll your bags only with lignum 
Rhodium finely beaten, and it 
will giue an excellent sent to your 
linnen. 
 
[}36. To make haire of a faire yellowe or 
golden colour.}] 
 
THe last water that is drawne 
from honey being of a deepe 
red colour performeth the same 
[^f.H10v^] 
excellently, but the same hath a 
strong smell, and therefore must 
be sweetned with some aromatical 
bodie. 
 
Or else the haire beeing first 
cleane washed and then moistned 
a prettie while by a good fire in 
warme allum water with a spunge, 
you may moisten the same in a 
decoctio~ of Turmericke, rubarb, 
or the barke of the Barberie tree, 
and so it will receiue a most faire 
and beautifull colour. The Dogberrie 
is also an excellent berrie 
to make a golden liquor withall 
for this purpose, beate your allum 
to powder, and when the water 
is ready to seeth, dissolue it therin: 
foure ounces to a pottle of water 
will be sufficient, let it boyle a 
while, straine it, and this is your 
allom licour wherewith you must 
first prepare the haire. 
 
[}37. How to colour the head or beard into 
a Chesnut colour in halfe an houre.}] 
 
[^f.H11r^] 
TAke one part of lead calcined 
with sulphur, and one parte of 
quicke lime, temper them somewhat 
thin with water, lay it vpon 
the haire, chafing it well in, and 
let it dry one quarter of an houre 
or thereabout, then wash the same 
off with faire water diuers times, 
and lastly, with soape and water, 
and it will be a verie naturall haire 
colour. The longer it lyeth vpon 
the haire the browner it groweth. 
This coloureth not the flesh at all, 
and yet it lasteth verie long 
in the haire. Sæpius 
expertum.
