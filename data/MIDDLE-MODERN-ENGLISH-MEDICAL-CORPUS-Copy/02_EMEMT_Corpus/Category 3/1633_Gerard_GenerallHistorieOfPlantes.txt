[}THE SECOND BOOKE OF 
THE HISTORIE OF PLANTS: 
 
Containing the description, place, time, names, nature, and 
vertues of all sorts of Herbes for meate, medicine, 
or sweet smelling vse, &c.}] 
 
WE haue in our first booke sufficiently described the Grasses, Rushes, 
Flags, Corne, and bulbous rooted Plants, which for the most part are 
such as with their braue and gallant floures decke and beautifie Gardens, 
and feed rather the eyes than the belly. Now there remaine certaine 
other bulbes, whereof the most (though not all) serue for food: 
of which we will also discourse in the first place in this booke, diuiding 
them in such sort, that those of one kinde shall be separated from another. In handling these and such as next succeed them, we shall treat 
of diuers, yea the most part of those Herbes that the Greekes call by a 
generall name [^GREEK OMITTED^] and the Latines, Olera: and we in English, Salletherbes. 
When we haue past ouer these, we shall speake of other plants, as they shall haue resemblance 
each to other in their externall forme. 
 
[}CHAP. 1. Of Turneps.}] 
 
[}The Kindes.}] 
 
THere be sundry sorts of Turneps; some wilde; some of the garden; some with round roots 
globe fashion; other ouall or peare fashion; and another sort longish or somwhat like a Radish: 
and of all these there are sundry varieties, some being great, and some of a smaller sort. 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 THe Turnep hath long rough and greene leaues, cut or snipt about the edges with 
deepe gashes. The stalke diuideth it selfe into sundry branches or armes, bearing 
at the top small floures of a yellow colour, and sometimes of a light purple: 
which being past, there do succeed long cods full of small blackish seed like rape 
seed. The root is round like a bowle, and sometimes a little stretched out in length, growing very 
shallow in the ground, and often shewing it selfe aboue the face of the earth. 
 
2 This is like the precedent in each respect, but that the root is not made so globous or 
bowle-fashioned as the former, but slenderer, and much longer, as you may perceiue by the figure 
wee here giue you. 
 
3 The small Turnep is like vnto the first described, sauing that it is lesser. The root is much 
sweeter in taste, as my selfe hath often proued. 
 
4 There is another sort of small Turnep said to haue red roots; and there are other-some 
whose roots are yellow both within and without; some also are greene on the outside, and othersome 
blackish. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
The Turnep prospereth wel in a light, loose, and fat earth, and so loose, as Petrus Crescentius saith, 
[^p.232^] 
that it may be turned almost into dust. It groweth in fields and diuers vineyards or Hop gardens 
in most places of England. 
 
The small Turnep groweth by Hackney, in a sandy ground; and those that are brought to 
Cheape-side market from that Village are the best that euer I tasted. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
Turneps are sowne in the spring, as also in the end of August. They floure and seed the second 
yeare after they are sowen: for those which floure the same yeare that they are sowen are a degenerate 
kinde, called in Cheshire about the Namptwitch, Mad neeps, of their euill qualitie in causing 
frensie and giddinesse of the braine for a season. 
 
1 Rapum majus. 
Great Turnep. 
[^An illustration of a turnip omitted.^] 
 
2 Rapum radice oblonga. 
Longish rooted Turnep. 
[^An illustration of a turnip omitted.^] 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
The Turnep is called in Latine, Rapum: in Greeke, [^GREEK OMITTED^]: the name commonly vsed in shops 
and euery where is Rapa. The Lacedemonians call it [^GREEK OMITTED^]: the Boetians, [^GREEK OMITTED^], as Athenæus reporteth: 
in high Dutch, Ruben: in low Dutch, Rapen: in French, Naueau rond: in Spanish, Nabo: 
in English, Turnep, and Rape. 
 
[}The Temperature and Vertues.}] 
 
[/1./] 
The bulbous or knobbed root, which is properly called Rapum or Turnep, and hath giuen the 
name to the plant, is many times eaten raw, especially of the poore people in Wales, but most 
commonly boiled. The raw root is windy, and engendreth grosse and cold bloud; the boyled 
doth coole lesse, and so little, that it cannot be perceiued to coole at all, yet it is moist and windy. 
 
[/2./] 
It auaileth not a little after what manner it is prepared; for being boyled in water, or in a certaine 
broth, it is more moist, and sooner descendeth, and maketh the body more soluble; but 
being rosted or baked it drieth, and ingendreth lesse winde, and yet it is not altogether without 
winde. But howsoeuer they be dressed, they yeeld more plenty of nourishment than those that are 
eaten raw: they do increase milke in womens brests, and naturall seed, and prouoke vrine. 
 
[/3./] 
The decoction of Turneps is good against the cough and hoarsenesse of the voice, being drunke 
in the euening with a little sugar, or a quantitie of clarified honey. 
 
[/4./] 
Dioscorides writeth, That the Turnep it selfe being stamped, is with good successe applied vpon 
[^p.233^] 
mouldie or kibed heeles, and that also oile of roses boiled in a hollow turnep vnder the hot embers 
doth cure the same. 
 
The young and tender shootes or springs of Turneps at their first comming forth of the 
[/5./] 
ground, boiled and eaten as a sallade, prouoke vrine. 
 
The seed is mixed with counterpoisons and treacles: and being drunke it is a remedie against 
[/6./] 
poifons. 
 
They of the lowe countries doe giue the oile which is pressed out of the seed, against the after 
[/7./] 
throwes of women newly brought to bed, and also minister it to young children against the 
wormes, which it both killeth and driueth forth. 
 
The oile washed with water doth allaie the feruent heat and ruggednesse of the skin. 
[/8./] 
 
[}CHAP. 2. Of wilde Turneps.}] 
 
[}The Kindes.}] 
 
THere be three sorts of wilde Turneps; one our common Rape which beareth the seed whereof 
is made rape oile, and feedeth singing birds: the other the common enemy to corne, which 
call Charlock; whereof there be two kindes, one with a yellow, or els purple floure, the 
other with a white floure: there is also another of the water and marish grounds. 
 
1 Rapum syluestre. 
Wilde Turneps. 
[^An illustration omitted.^] 
 
2 Rapistrum aruorum. 
Charlocke or Chadlocke. 
[^An illustration omitted.^] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 WIlde Turneps or Rapes, haue long, broad, and rough leaues like those of Turneps, but 
not so deeply gashed in the edges. The stalkes are slender and brittle, somewhat hairie, 
of two cubits high, diuiding themselues at the top into many armes or branches, 
whereon doe grow little yellowish flowers: which being past, there doe succeed small long cods 
which containe the seed like that of the Turnep, but smaller, somewhat reddish, and of a firie hot 
[^p.234^] 
and biting taste as is the mustard, but bitterer. The root is small, and perisheth when the 
seed is ripe. 
 
2 Charlocke, or the wilde rape, hath leaues like vnto the former, but lesser, the stalke and leaues 
being also rough. The stalkes bee of a cubite high, slender, and branched; the floures are sometimes 
purplish, but more often yellow. The rootes are slender, with certaine threds or strings 
hanging on them. 
 
There is also another varietie hereof with the leaues lesse diuided, and much smoother than 
the two last described, hauing yellow floures and cods not so deeply joynted as the last described: 
this is that, which is set sorth by Matthiolus vnder the name of Lampsana. 
 
3 Water Chadlock groweth vp to the height of three foot or somewhat more, with branches 
slender and smooth in respect of any of the rest of his kinde, set with rough ribbed leaues, deeply 
indented about the lower part of the leafe. The floures grow at the top of the branches, vmble 
or tuft fashion, sometimes of one colour, and sometimes of another. The root is long, tough, 
and full of strings, creeping and putting forth many stalkes: the seed vessells are short and small. 
Bauhine hath this vnder the title of Raphanus aquaticus alter. 
 
2 Rapistrum aruense alterum. 
Another wilde Charlocke. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
3 Rapistrum aquaticum. 
Water Chadlocke. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Wilde Turneps or Rapes, doe grow of themselues in fallow fields, and likewise by highwayes 
neere vnto old walls, vpon ditch-bankes, and neere vnto townes and villages, and in other vntoiled 
and rough places. 
 
The Chadlocke groweth for the most part among corne in barraine grounds, and often by the 
borders of fields and such like places. 
 
Water Chadlocke groweth in moist medowes and marish grounds, as also in water ditches, 
and such like places. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
These doe floure from March, till Summer be farre spent, and in the meane season the seed is 
ripe. 
 
[^p.235^] 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Wilde Turnep is called in Latine Rapistrum, Rapum syluestre, and of some, Sinapi syluestre, or 
wild mustard: in high Dutch, Hederich: in low Dutch, Herick: in French, Vclar: in English, 
Rape, and Rape seed. Rapistrum aruorum is called Charlock, and Carlock. 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
The seed of these wild kindes of Turneps as also the water Chadlock, are hot and drie as mustard 
seed is. Some haue thought that Carlock hath a drying and clensing qualitie, and somewhat 
digesting. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
Diuers vse the seed of Rape in steed of mustard seed, who either make hereof a sauce bearing 
[/9./] 
the name of mustard, or else mixe it with mustard seed: but this kinde of sauce is not so pleasant 
to the taste, because it is bitter. 
 
Galen writeth that these being eaten engender euill blood: yet Disoscorides saith, they warme the 
[/10./] 
stomacke and nourish somewhat. 
 
[}CHAP. 3. Of Nauewes.}] 
 
[}The Kindes.}] 
 
THere be sundrie kindes of Nape or Nauewes degenerating from the kindes of Turnep; of 
which some are of the garden; and other wilde, or of the field. 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 NAuew gentle is like vnto Turneps in stalkes, floures, and seed, as also in the shape of 
the leaues, but those of the Nauew are much smoother; it also differeth in the root: the 
Turnep is round like a globe, the Nauew root is somewhat stretched forth in length. 
 
1 Bunias. 
Nauew Gentle. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
2 Bunias syluestris L'Obelij. 
Wilde Nauew. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
2 The small or wilde Nauew is like vnto the former, sauing that it is altogether lesser. The 
root is small, somewhat long, with threads long and tough at the end thereof. 
 
[^p.236^] 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Nauew-gentle requireth a loose and yellow mould euen as doth the Turnep, and prospereth in 
a fruitfull soile: he is sowen in France, Bauaria, and other places in the fields for the seeds sake, as 
is likewise that wild Colewort called of the old writers Crambe: for the plentifull increase of the 
seeds bringeth no small gaine to the husbandmen of that countrey, because that being pressed 
they yeeld an oile which is vsed not onely in lampes, but also in the making of sope; for of this 
oile and a lie made of certaine ashes, is boiled a sope which is vsed in the Lowe-countries euery 
where to scoure and wash linnen clothes. I haue heard it reported that it is at this day sowen in 
England for the same purpose. 
 
The wilde Nauew groweth vpon ditch bankes neere vnto villages and good townes, as also vpon 
fresh marshie bankes in most places. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
The Nauew is sowen, floureth and seedeth at the same time that the Turnep doth. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
The Nauew is called in Latine Napus, and also Bunias: in Greeke [^GREEK OMITTED^]: the Germaines call it 
Steckruben: the Brabanders, Steckropen: in Spanish, Naps: in Italian, Nauo: the Frenchmen, 
Naueau: in English, Nauew-gentle, or French Naueau. The other is called Napus sylvestru, or 
wild Nauew. 
 
[}The Temperature and Vertues.}] 
 
The Nauew and the Turnep are all one in temperature and vertues, yet some suppose that the 
Nauew is a little drier, and not so soone concocted, nor passeth downe so easily, and doth withall 
ingender lesse winde. In the rest it is answerable to the Turnep. 
 
[/11./] 
The seeds of these taken in drinke or broth are good against poyson, and are vsually put into 
Antidotes for the same purpose. 
[/12./] 
 
[}CHAP. 4. Of Lyons Turnep, or Lyons leafe.}] 
 
Leontopet alon. 
Lyons leafe. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
LYons Turnep or Lyons leafe, hath broad 
leaues like vnto Coleworts, or rather like the 
pionyes cut and diuided into sundry great 
gashes: the stalke is two foot long, thicke, and 
full of iuyce, diuiding it selfe into diuers branches 
or wings; in the tops whereof stand red 
floures: afterward there appeareth long cods in 
which lie the seeds like vnto tares, or wilde 
chichs. The root is great, bumped like a Turnep, 
and blacke without. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
It groweth among corne in diuers places of 
Italy, in Candie also, and in other Prouinces towards 
the South and East. The right honorable 
Lord Zouch brought a plant hereof from Italy 
at his returne into England, the which was planted 
in his garden. But as farre as I doe know, it 
perished. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
It floureth in winter, as witnesseth Petrus Bellonius. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
The Grecians call it [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is, Leonis 
folium, or Lyons leafe: Plinie doth call it also 
Leontopetalon: Apuleius, Leontopodion: yet there is 
another plant called by the same name. There 
bee many bastard Names giuen vnto it, as 
[^p.237^] 
Rapeium, Papauerculum, Semen Leoninum, Pes Leoninus, and Brumaria: in English Lyons leafe, and 
Lyons Turnep. 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
Lyons Turnep is of force to digest; it is hot and drie in the third degree, as Galen teacheth. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
The root (saith Dioscorides) taken in wine doth helpe them that are bitten of Serpents, and it 
[/13./] 
doth most speedily alay the paine. It is put into glisters which are made for them that bee tormented 
with the Sciatica. 
 
[}CHAP. 5. Of Radish.}] 
 
[}The Kindes.}] 
 
THere be sundrie sorts of Radish, whereof some be long and white; others long and blacke; 
some round and white; others round, or of the forme of a peare, and blacke of colour; some 
wilde, or of the field; and some tame, or of the garden, whereof we will intreat in this present 
chapter. 
 
1 Raphanus sativus. 
Garden Radish. 
[^An illustration of the radish omitted.^] 
 
2 Radicula satiua minor. 
Small garden Radish. 
[^An illustration of the radish omitted.^] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 THe garden Radish sendeth forth great and large leaues, greene, rough, cut on both 
sides with deepe gashes, not vnlike to the garden Turnep, but greater. The stalkes bee 
round and parted into many branches; out of which spring small floures of a light purple colour, 
made of foure little leaues: and when they be past, there doe come in place sharpe pointed cods 
huft or blowne vp toward the stalke, full of spungious substance, wherein is contained the seed, 
of a light browne colour, somewhat greater than the seeds of Turneps or Coleworts. The root 
is grosse, long, and white both without and within, and of a sharpe taste. 
 
[^p.238^] 
2 The small garden Radish hath leaues like the former, but smaller, and more brittle in handling. 
The stalke of two cubits high, whereon be the floures like the former. The seed is smaller, 
and not so sharpe in taste. The root is small, long, white both within and without, except a little 
that sheweth it selfe aboue the ground of a reddish colour. 
 
3 Radish with a round root hath leaues like the garden Turnep: among which leaues springeth 
vp a round and smooth stalke, diuiding it selfe toward the top into two or three branches, 
whereon doe grow small purplish floures made of foure leaues apeece: which being past, there 
doe come in place small long cods puft vp or bunched in two, and sometimes three places, full of 
pith as the common Radish; wherein is contained the seed, somewhat smaller than the Colewort 
seed, but of a hotter taste. The root is round and firme, nothing waterish like the common 
Radish, more pleasant in taste, wholsomer, not causing such stinking belchings as the garden 
Radish doth. 
 
4 The Radish with a root fashioned like a peare, groweth to the height of three or foure cubits, 
of a bright reddish colour. The leaues are deeply cut or iagged like those of the Turnep, 
somewhat rough. The floures are made of foure leaues, of a light carnation or fleshie colour. The 
seed is contained in small bunched cods like the former. The root is fashioned like a peare or long 
Turnep, blacke without and white within, of a firme and solide substance. The taste is quicke 
and sharpe, biting the tongue as the other kindes of Radish, but more strongly. 
 
3 Rhaphanus orbiculatus. 
Round Radish. 
[^An illustration of the radish omitted.^] 
 
4 Rapharus pyriformis, siue xadice nigra. 
The blacke, or Peare-fashion Radish. 
[^An illustration of the radish omitted.^] 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
All the kindes of Radish require a loose ground which hath beene long manured and is somewhat 
fat. They prosper well in sandie ground, where they are not so subiect to wormes, as in other 
grounds. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
These kindes of Radish are most fitly sowen after the Summer Solstice in Iune or Iulie: for being 
sowen betimes in the spring they yeeld not their roots so kindly nor profitably, for then they 
doe for the most part quickly run vp to stalke and seed, where otherwise they doe not floure and 
seed till the next spring following. They may be sowen ten moneths in the yeere, but as I said 
before, the best time is in Iune and Iulie. 
 
[^p.239^] 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Radish is called in Greeke of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Galen, and other old writers [^GREEK OMITTED^] in shops, 
Raphanus, and Satiua Radicula: in high Dutch, Rettich: in low Dutch, Radus: in French, Raifort: 
in Italian, Raphano: in Spanish, Rauano: in English, Radish, and Rabone: in the Bohemian tongue, 
Rzedfew. Cælius affirmeth that the seed of Radish is called of Marcellus Empericus, Bacanon; and 
so likewise of Aetius in the second chapter of the second booke of his Tetrabible: yet Cornarius 
doth not reade Bacanon, but Cacanon: The name of Bacanum is also found in N. Myrepsus, in the 
255. Composition of his first booke. 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
Radish doth manifestly heat and drie, open and make thin by reason of the biting quality that 
ruleth in it. Galen maketh them hot in the third degree, and drie in the second, and sheweth that 
it is rather a sauce than a nourishment. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
Radish are eaten raw with bread in stead of other food; but being eaten after that manner, they 
[/14./] 
yeeld very little nourishment, and that faultie and ill. But for the most part, they are vsed as sauce 
with meates to procure appetite, and in that sort they ingender blood lesse faulty, than eaten alone 
or with bread onely: but seeing they be of a harder digestion than meates, they are also many 
times troublesome to the stomacke; neuerthelesse, they serue to distribute and disperse the nourishment, 
especially being taken after meat; and taken before meat, they cause belchings, and 
ouerthrow the stomacke. 
 
Before meate they cause vomiting, and especially the rinde: the which as it is more biting than 
[/15./] 
the inner substance, so doth it with more force cause that effect if it be giuen with Oximel, which 
is a syrupe made with vineger and hony. 
 
Moreouer, Radish prouoketh vrine, and dissolueth cluttered sand, and driueth it forth, if a good 
[/16./] 
draught of the decoction thereof be drunke in the morning. Pliny writeth, and Dioscorides likwise, 
that it is good against an old cough; and to make thin, thicke and grosse flegme which sticketh 
in the chest. 
 
In stead hereof the Phisitions of our age doe vse water distilled thereof: which likewise procureth 
[/17./] 
vrine mightily, and driueth forth stones in the kidnies. 
 
The root sliced and laid ouer night in white or Rhenish wine, and drunke in the morning, driueth 
[/18./] 
out vrine and grauell mightily, but in taste and smell it is very lothsome. 
 
The root stamped with hony and the powder of a sheepes heart dried, causeth haire to grow in 
[/19./] 
short space. 
 
The seed causeth vomite, prouoketh vrine: and being drunke with honied vineger, it killeth and 
[/20./] 
driueth forth wormes. 
 
The root stamped with the meale of Darnell and a little white wine vineger, taketh away all 
[/21./] 
blew and blacke spots, and brused blemishes of the face. 
 
The root boiled in broth, and the decoction drunke, is good against an old cough: it moueth 
[/22./] 
womens sicknesse, and causeth much milke. 
[/23./] 
 
[}CHAP. 6. Of wilde Radish.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 WIlde Radish hath a shorter narrower leafe than the common Radish, and more 
deeply cut or iagged, almost like the leaues of Rocket, but much greater. The 
stalke is slender and rough, of two cubits high, diuided toward the top into many 
branches. The floures are small and white: the cod is long, slender, aud ioynted, wherein is the 
seed. The root is of the bignesse of the finger, white within and without, of a sharpe and biting 
taste. 
 
2 The water Radish hath long and broad leaues, deeply indented or cut euen to the middle rib. 
The stalke is long, weake, and leaneth this way and that way, being not able to stand vpright without 
a prop, in so much that yee shall neuer find it, no not when it is very young, but leaning down 
vpon the mud or mire where it groweth. The floures grow at the top made of foure small yellow 
leaues. The root is long, set in sundrie spaces with small fibres or threds like the rowell of a spur, 
hot and burning in taste more than any of the garden Radishes. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
The first growes vpon the borders of bankes and ditches cast vp, and in the borders of fields. 
 
[^p.240^] 
The second growes in ditches, standing waters, and riuers; as on the stone wall that bordereth 
vpon the riuer Thames by the Sauoy in London. 
 
1 Raphanus syluestris. 
Wilde Radish. 
[^An illustration of the radish omitted.^] 
 
2 Raphanus aquaticus. 
Water Radish. 
[^An illustration of the radish omitted.^] 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
They floure in Iune, and the seed is ripe in August. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
The first of these is Rapistrum flore albo Erucæ folijs, of Lobell: Armoratia, or Rapistrum album 
of Tabernamontanus: and Raphanus sylvestris, of our Author: in English, wilde Radish. 
 
The second is Radicula sylvestris of Dodonæus: and Rhaphanus aquaticus, or palustris of others: in 
English, water Radish. 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
The wilde Radishes are of like temperature with the garden Radish, but hotter and drier. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
[/24./] 
Dioscorides writeth, that the leaues are receiued among the pot herbes, and likewise the boiled 
root, which as he saith, doth heate, and prouoke vrine. 
 
[}CHAP. 7. Of Horse Radish.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 HOrse Radish bringeth forth great leaues, long, broad, sharpe pointed and snipped about 
the edges, of a deepe greene colour like those of the great garden Docke, called, 
of some Monkes Rubarbe, of others Patience, but longer and rougher. The stalke 
is slender and brittle, bearing at the top small white floures: which being past, there follow small 
cods, wherein is the seed. The root is long and thicke, white of colour, in taste sharpe, and very 
much biting the tongue like mustard. 
 
2 Dittander or pepperwort, hath broad leaues, long, and sharpe pointed, of a blewish greene 
colour like woad, somewhat snipt or cut about the edges like a sawe. The stalke is round and 
[^p.241^] 
tough: vpon the branches whereof grow little white floures. The root is long and hard, creeping 
farre abroad in the ground, in such sort that when it is once taken in a ground, it is not possible to 
root it out, for it will vnder the ground creepe and shoot vp and bud forth in many places farre 
abroad. The root also is sharp and biteth the tongue like pepper, whereof it tooke the name pepperwort. 
 
3 This which we giue you in the third place hath a small fibrous root, the stalke growes 
vp to the height of two cubits, and it is diuided into many branches furnished with white floures, 
after which follow seeds like in shape and taste to Thlaspi, or Treacle mustard. The leaues are 
somewhat like those of Woad. This is nourished in some Gardens of the Low Countryes, and 
Lobell was the first that gaue the figure hereof, and that vnder the same title as wee here giue 
you it. 
 
1 Raphanus rusticanus. 
Horse Radish. 
[^An illustration of horseradish omitted.^] 
 
2 Raphanus syluestris Offic. Lepidium Æginetae Lob. 
Dittander, and Pepperwort. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Horse Radish for the most part groweth and is planted in gardens, yet haue I found it wilde in 
sundrie places, as at Namptwich in Cheshire, in a place called the Milne eye, and also at a small 
village neere London called Hogsdon, in the field next vnto a farme house leading to Kings-land, 
where my very good friend master Bredwell practitioner in Phisick, a learned and diligent searcher 
of Simples, and master William Martin one of the fellowship of Barbers and Chirurgians, my 
deere aud louing friend, in company with him found it, and gaue me knowledge of the place, where 
it flourisheth to this day. 
 
Dittander is planted in gardens, and is to be found wild also in England in sundry places, as at 
Clare by Ouenden in Essex, at the Hall of Brinne in Lancashire, and neere vnto Excester in the 
West parts of England. It delighteth to grow in sandie and shadowie places somewhat moist. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
Horse Radish for the most part floureth in Aprill or May, and the seed is ripe in August, and 
that so rare or seldome seene, as that Petrus Placentius hath written, that it bringeth forth no seed at 
all. Dittander floures in Iune and Iuly. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Horse Radish is commonly called Raphanus rusticanus, or Magnus, and of diuers simply Raphanus 
[^p.242^] 
syluestris: of the high Dutch men, Merrettich, Krain or Kren: in French, Grand raifort: of 
the low Germaines, Merradus: in English, mountaine radish, Great Raifort, and Horse Radish. 
It is called in the North part of England, Redcole. 
 
Diuers thinke that this Horse Radish is an enemy to Vines, and that the hatred betweene 
them is so great, that if the roots hereof be planted neere to the Vine it bendeth backward from it, 
as not willing to haue fellowship with it. 
 
It is also reported that the root hereof stamped, and cast into good and pleasant wine, doth 
forthwith turne it into vineger: but the old writers doe ascribe this enmity to the vine and Brassica, 
our coleworts, which the most ancients haue named [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
 
Dittander is described of Pliny by the name of Lepidium in his 19. booke, 9. Chapter: likewise 
Ægineta maketh mention of this plant, by the name Lepidium: in shops, Raphanus syluestris, and 
Piperitis: the Germans call it, Pfefferkraut: the lowe Dutch men, Pepper cruyt: the English 
men, Dittander, Dittany, and Pepperwort. 
 
3 Lepidium Annum. 
Annuall Dittander. 
[^An illustration of dittander omitted.^] 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
These kindes of wilde Radishes, are hot and 
drie in the third degree: they haue a drying and 
clensing quality, and somewhat digesting. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
[/25./] 
Horse Radish stamped with a little vineger put 
thereto, is commonly vsed among the Germanes 
for sauce to eate fish with, and such like meates, 
as we doe mustard; but this kinde of sauce doth 
heate the stomacke better, and causeth better digestion 
than mustard. 
 
[/26./] 
Oximel or syrupe made with vineger and honie, 
in which the rindes of Horse radish haue 
beene infused three dayes, causeth vomit, and is 
commended against the quartaine ague. 
 
[/27./] 
The leaues boiled in wine, and a little oile 
oliue added thereto and laid vpon the grieued 
parts in manner of a Pultis, doe mollifie and take 
away the hard swellings of the liuer and milte; 
and being applied to the bottome of the belly is 
a remedie for the strangurie. 
 
[/28./] 
It profiteth much in the expulsion of the secondine 
or after-birth. 
 
It mittigateth and asswageth the paine of the 
[/29./] 
hip or haunch, commonly called Sciatica. 
 
It profiteth much against the collicke, strangurie, 
and difficultie of making water, vsed in 
[/30./] 
stead of mustard as aforesaid. 
 
[/31./] 
The root stamped and giuen to drinke, killeth 
the wormes in children: the iuyce giuen doth 
the same: an ointment made thereof, doth the like, being annointed vpon the belly of the child. 
 
[/32./] 
The leaues of Pepperwort but especially the rootes, be extreame hot, for they haue a burning 
and bitter taste. It is of the number of scorching and blistring simples, saith Pliny in his 
20. booke, the 17. chap. and therefore by his hot qualitie, it mendeth the skin in the face, and taketh 
away scabs, scarres, and manginesse, if any thing remaine after the healing of vlcers and such 
like. 
 
[}CHAP. 8. Of Winter Cresses.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
THe Winter Cresses hath many greene, broad, smoothe and flat leaues like vnto the common 
turneps, whose stalkes be round, and full of branches, bringing forth at the top small yellow 
floures: after them doe follow small cods, wherein is conteined small reddish seed. 
 
[^p.243^] 
1 Barbarea. 
Winter Cresses. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
It groweth in gardens among pot herbes, and 
very common in the fields, neere to pathes and 
high wayes, almost euery where. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
This herbe is green all winter long, it floureth 
in May, and seedeth in Iune. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Winter Cresse is called of the Latines, Cardamum, 
or Nasturtium Hibernum, of some, Barbarea, 
and Pseudobunium: the Germanes call it 
S. Barberen kraut: in lowe Dutch, Winter 
Kersse. 
 
It seemeth to be Dioscorides his [^GREEK OMITTED^], that is 
to say, false or bastard Bunium: in English, 
winter Cresses, or herbe Saint Barbara. 
 
[}The Nature.}] 
 
This herbe is hot and drie in the second degree. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
The seed of winter Cresse causeth one to 
[/33./] 
make water, and driueth forth grauell, and helpeth 
the strangurie. 
 
The iuyce thereof mundifieth corrupt and filthy 
[/34./] 
vlcers, being made in forme of an vnguent 
with waxe, oyle, and turpentine. 
 
In winter when salad herbes bee scarce, this 
[/35./] 
herbe is thought to be equall with Cresses of 
the garden, or Rocket. 
 
This herbe helpeth the scuruie, being boiled 
[/36./] 
among scuruie grasse, called in Latine Cochlearia, 
causing it to worke the more effectually. 
 
[}CHAP. 9. Of Mustard.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 THe tame or garden Mustard, hath great rough leaues like to those of the Turnep, but 
rougher and lesser. The stalke is round, rough, and hairie, of three cubits high, diuided 
into many branches, whereon doe grow small yellow floures, and after them long cods, slender 
and rough, wherein is contained round seed bigger then Rape seed, of colour yellow, of taste 
sharpe, and biting the tongue as doth our common field mustard. 
 
2 Our ordinary Mustard hath leaues like Turneps, but not so rough, the stalkes are 
smooth, and grow sometimes to three, foure, or fiue cubits high, they haue many branches, and 
the leaues vpon these branches, especially the vppermost, are long and narrow, and hang downeward 
on small stalkes; the cods are short, and lie flat and close to the branches, and are somewhat 
square; the seed is reddish or yellow. 
 
3 The other tame Mustard is like to the former in leaues, and branched stalkes, but lesser, and 
they are more whitish and rough. The floures are likewise yellow, and the seed browne like 
the Rape seed, which is also not a little sharpe or byting. 
 
4 This which I giue you bere being the Sinapi sativum alterum, of Lobel; and the Sinapi 
album of the shops, growes but low, and it hath rough crooked cods, and whitish seeds; the stalks, 
floures, and leaues, are mnch like the first described. 
 
5 The wilde Mustard hath leaues like those of shepheards purse, but larger, and more deeply 
indented, with a stalke growing to the height of two foot, bearing at the top small yellow floures 
made of foure leaues: the cods be small and-slender, wherein is contained reddish seed, much 
smaller than any of the others, but not so sharpe or biting. 
 
[^p.244^] 
1 Sinapi sativum. 
Garden Mustard. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
3 Sinapi sativum alterum, Dod. 
Field Mustard. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
4 Sinapi album. 
White Mustard. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
5 Sinapi syluestre minus. 
Small wilde Mustard. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[^p.245^] 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Our ordinarie Mustard (whose description I haue added) as also the wilde and small grow 
wilde in many places of this kingdome, and may all three be found on the bankes about the back 
of Old-street, and in the way to Islington. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
Mustard may be sowen in the beginning of the Spring: the seed is ripe in Iuly or August: It 
commeth to perfection the same yeare that it is sowen. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
The Greekes call Mustard, [^GREEK OMITTED^]: the Athenians called it [^GREEK OMITTED^]: the Latines, Sinapi: the rude and 
barbarous, Sinapium: the Germanes, Sensf: the French, Seneue and Moustarde: the low-Dutch-men, 
Mostaert saet: the Spaniards, Mostaza, and Mostalla: the Bohemians, Horcice: Pliny calls 
it Thlaspi, whereof doubtlesse it is a kinde: and some haue called it Saurion. 
 
These kindes of Mustard haue beene so briefely treated of by all Writers, that it is hard to 
giue the right distinctions of them, and a matter of more difficultie than is expected in a thing so 
vulgarly knowne and vsed: I will therefore endeauour in a few words to distinguish those kindes 
of mustard which are vulgarly written of. 
 
1 The first is Sinapi primum of Matthiolus and Dodonaeus; and Sinapi sativum Erucæ aut Rapifolio 
of Lobel. 
 
2 The second I cannot iustly referre to any of those which are written of by Authours; for it 
hath not a cod like Rape, as Pena and Lobel describe it; nor a seed bigger than it, as Dodonaeus affirmeth; 
yet I suspect, and almost dare affirme that it is the same with the former mentioned by 
them, though much differing from their figures and description. 
 
3 The third (which also I suspect is the same with the fourth) is Sinapi alterum of Matthiolus, 
and Sinapi agreste Apij, aut potius Laueris folio, of Lobel: and Sinapi sativum alterum of Dodonaeus. 
 
4 The fourth is by Lobel called Sinapi alterum sativum; and this is Sinapi album Ofsicinarum, as 
Pena and Lobel affirme, Aduers. pag. 68. 
 
5 The fifth is Sinapi syluestre of Dodonaeus: and Sinapi syluestre minus Bursæ pastoris folio, of Lobel. 
It is much like Rocket, and therefore Bauhine fitly calls it Sinapi Erucæ folio: in English it may be 
called Small wilde Mustard. 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
The seed of Mustard, especially that which we chiefely vse, doth heat and make thinne, and also 
draweth forth. It is hot and dry in the fourth degree, according to Galen. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
The seed of Mustard pound with vineger, is an excellent sauce, good to be eaten with any grosse 
[/37./] 
meates either fish or flesh, because it doth helpe digestion, warmeth the stomacke, and prouoketh 
appetite. 
 
It is giuen with good successe in like manner to such as be short winded, and are stopped in the 
[/38./] 
breast with tough flegme from the head and braine. 
 
It appeaseth the tooth-ache being chewed in the mouth. 
[/39./] 
 
They vse to make a gargarisme with honey, vineger, and mustard seed, against the tumours and 
[/40./] 
swellings of the Vuula, and the almonds about the throat and root of the tongue. 
 
Mustard drunke with water and honey prouoketh the termes and vrine. 
[/41./] 
 
The seed of mustard beaten and put into the nosthrils, causeth sneesing, and raiseth women sicke 
[/42./] 
of the mother out of their fits. 
 
It is good against the falling sickenesse, and such as haue the Lithargie, if it be laid plaisterwise 
[/43./] 
vpon the head (after shauing) being tempered with figs. 
 
It helpeth the Sciatica, or ache in the hip or huckle bone: it also cureth all manner of paines 
[/44./] 
proceeding of a cold cause. 
 
It is mixed with good successe with drawing plaisters, and with such as waste and consume 
[/45./] 
nodes and hard swellings. 
 
It helpeth those that haue their haire pulled off; it taketh away the blew and blacke marks that 
[/46./] 
come of bruisings. 
 
The seed of the white Mustard is vsed in some Antidotes, as Electuarium de ouo, &c. 
[/47./] 
[/48./] 
 
[^p.246^] 
[}CHAP. 10. Of Rocket.}] 
 
[}The Kindes.}] 
 
THere be sundry kindes of Rocket, some tame, or of the garden; some wilde, or of the field; 
some of the water, and of the sea. 
 
1 Eruca satiua. 
Garden Rocket. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
2 Eruca syluestris. 
Wilde Rocket. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 GArden Rocket, or Rocket gentle, hath leaues like those of Turneps, but not neere so 
great nor rough. The stalks rise vp of a cubit, & somtimes two cubits high, weak and 
brittle; at the top whereof grow the floures of a whitish colour, and sometimes yellowish; 
which being past, there do succeed long cods, which containe the seed, not vnlike to rape 
seed, but smaller. 
 
2 The common Rocket, which some keepe in Gardens, and which is vsually called the wilde 
Rocket, is lesser than the Romane Rocket, or Rocket-gentle, the leaues and stalkes narrower, and 
more iagged. The floures be yellow, the cods also slenderer, the seed thereof is reddish, and biteth 
the tongue. 
 
3 This kinde of Rocket hath long narrow leaues almost such as those of Tarragon, but thicker 
and fatter, resembling rather the leaues of Myagrum, altogether vnlike any of the rest of the 
Rockets, sauing that the branch, floure, and seed are like the garden Rocket. 
 
4 There is another kinde of Rocket, thought by that reuerend and excellent Herbarist Carelus 
Clusius to be a kinde of Cresses; if not Cresses it selfe, yet cousine germane at the least. Vnto 
whose censure Lobelius is indifferent, whether to call it Rocket with thinne and narrow leaues, or 
to call it Cousine to the kindes of Cresses, hauing the taste of the one, and the shape of the 
other. The leaues are much diuided, and the floures yellow. 
 
5 There is is a wild kind of Sea-Rocket which hath long weake and tender branches trailing 
[^p.247^] 
vpon the ground, with long leaues like vnto common Rocket, or rather Groundswell, hauing small 
and whitish blew floures; in whose place commeth small cods, wherein is contained seed like that 
of Barley. 
 
6 Besides these there is another plant, whose figure which here I giue was by our Author 
formerly set forth in the precedent chapter, vnder the title of Sinapi syluestre; together with a large 
kinde thereof, vnder the name of Sinapi sativum alterum. Now I will onely describe the later, 
which I haue sometimes found in wet places: The root is woody: the stalke some foot long, crested, 
and hauing many branches, lying on the ground: the leafe is much diuided, and that after 
the manner of the wilde Rocket: the floures are of a bright yellow, and are succeeded by short 
crooked cods, wherein is contained a yellowish seed. 
 
3 Eruca syluestris angustifolia. 
Narrow leaued wilde Rocket. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
4 Erucanasturtio cognata tenuifolia. 
Cressy-Rocket. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Romane Rocket is cherished in Gardens. 
 
Common or wilde Rocket groweth in most gardens of it selfe: you may see most bricke and 
stone walls about London and elsewhere couered with it. 
 
The narrow leaued Rocket groweth neere vnto water sides, in the chinkes and creuises of stone 
walls among the morter. I found it as ye go from Lambeth bridge to the village of Lambeth, vnder 
a small bridge that you must passe ouer hard by the Thames side. 
 
I found Sea Rocket growing vpon the sands neere vnto the sea in the Isle of Thanet, hard by a 
house wherein Sir Henry Crispe did sometimes dwell, called Queakes house. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
These Kindes of Rocket floure in the moneths of Iune and Iuly, and the seed is tipe in September. 
 
The Romane Rocket dieth euery yeare, and recouereth it selfe againe by the falling of his 
owne seed. 
 
[^p.248^] 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Rocket is called in Greeke; [^GREEK OMITTED^]: in Latine, Eruca: in high Dutch, Rauekenkraut: in French, 
Roquette: in Low-Dutch, Rakette: in Italian, Ruchetta: in Spanish, Oruga; in English, Rocket, and 
Racket. The Poets do oft times name it Herbasalax: Eruca doth signifie likewise a certaine canker 
worme, which is an enemie to pot-herbes, but especially to Coleworts. 
 
The first is called Eruca satiua, or Hortensis major: Great Garden Rocket. 
 
2 The second, Eruca sylucstris: Wilde Rocket. 
 
3 This third is by Lobel called Eruca syluestris angustifolia: Narrow leaued wilde Rocket. 
 
4 Clusius fitly calls this, Nasturtium syluestre: and he reprehendeth Lobel for altering the name 
into Eruca Nasturtio cognatatenuifolia: Cressy-Rocket. 
 
5 The fifth is Eruca marina, (thought by Lobel and others to be Cakile Serapionis,) Sea Rocket. 
 
6 Eruca aquatica: Water Rocket. 
 
5 Erucamarina. 
Sea Rocket. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
6 Eruca aquatica. 
Water Rocket. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
Rocket is hot and dry in the third degree, therefore saith Galen it is not fit nor accustomed to be 
eaten alone. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
[/49./] 
Rocket is a good sallet herbe, if it be eaten with Lettuce, Purslane, and such cold herbes; for being 
so eaten it is good and wholesome for the stomacke, and causeth that such cold herbes do not 
ouer-coole the same: otherwise, to be eaten alone, it causeth head-ache, and heateth too much. 
 
[/50./] 
The vse of Rocket stirreth vp bodily lust, especially the seed. 
 
[/51./] 
It prouoketh vrine, and causeth good digestion. 
 
[/52./] 
Pliny reporteth, That whosoeuer taketh the seed of Rocket before he be whipt, shall be so hardened, 
that he shall easily endure the paines. 
 
[/53./] 
The root and seed stamped, and mixed with Vineger and the gall of an Oxe, taketh away freckles, 
lentiles, blacke and blew spots, and all such deformities of the face. 
 
[/54./] 
 
[^p.249^] 
[}CHAP.11. Of Tarragon.}] 
 
Draco herba. 
Tarragon. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The description.}] 
 
TArragon the sallade herbe hath long and 
narrow leaues of a deepe greene colour, 
greater and longer than those of common Hyssope, 
with slender brittle round stalkes two cubites 
high: about the branches whereof hang 
little round flowers, neuer perfectly opened, of a 
yellow colour mixed with blacke, like those of 
common VVormewood. The root is long and 
fibrous, creeping farre abroad vnder the earth, as 
doe the rootes of Couch-grasse, by which sprouting 
forth it increaseth, yeelding no seede at all, 
but as it were a certaine chaffie or dustie matter 
that flieth away with the winde. 
 
[}The place.}] 
 
Tarragon is cherished in gardens, and is encreased 
by the young shootes: Ruellius and such 
others haue reported many strange tales hereof 
scarse worth the noting, saying, that the seed of 
flaxe put into a radish roote or sea Onion, and so 
set, doth bring forth this herbe Tarragon. 
 
[}The time.}] 
 
It is greene all Summer long, and a great part 
of Autumne, and floureth in Iuly. 
 
[}The names.}] 
 
It is called in Latine, Draco, Dracunculus hortensis, 
and Tragum vulgare by Clusius; Of the Italians, 
Dragoncellum; in French, Dragon, in English, Tarragon. 
 
It is thought to be that Tarchon which Auicen mentioneth in his 686. chapter: but he writeth 
so little thereof, as that nothing can certainly be affirmed of it. Simeon Sethi the Greeke also maketh 
mention of Tarchon. 
 
[}The temperature and vertues.}] 
 
Tarragon is hot and drie in the third degree, and not to be eaten alone in sallades, but ioyned 
with other herbes, as Lettuce, Purslain, and such like, that it may also temper the coldnes of them, 
like as Rocket doth, neither doe we know what other vse this herbe hath. 
 
[}CHAP.12. Of garden Cresses.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 GArden Cresses or Towne Cresses hath small narrow iagged leaues, sharpe and burning 
in taste. The stalks be round, a cubite high, which bring forth many small white flowers, 
and after little flat huskes or seede vessels, like to those of she pheards purse, wherein are 
contained seeds of a browne reddish colour. The roote dieth when the seede is ripe. 
 
2 There is another kinde in taste like the former, but in leaues farre different, which I recouered 
of seedes, sent me from Robinus dwelling in Paris. The stalkes rise vp to the height of a foot, 
garnished with many broad leaues deepely cut or indented about the edges: the middle of the 
leafe is deckt and garnished with many little small leaues or rather shreds of leaues, which make 
the same like a curlde fanne of feathers. The seede is like the former in shape. 
 
3 Spanish Cresses riseth forth of the ground like vnto Basill, afterwards the leaues grow 
larger and broader, like those of Marigolds; among the which riseth vp a crooked lymmer stalke, 
[^p.250^] 
whereupon do grow small tufts or spokie rundles of white flowers. The seede followeth, browne 
of colour, and bitter in taste. The whole plant is of a loathfome smell and sauour. 
 
4 Stone-Cresse groweth flat vpon the ground, with leaues iagged and cut about the edges 
like the oake leafe, resembling well the leaues of shepheardes purse. I haue not seene the flowers, 
and therefore they be not exprest in the figure; notwithstanding it is reported vnto me, that they 
bee small and white of colour, as are those of the garden Cresses. The seed is contained in small 
pouches or seede vessels, like those of Treacle mustard or Thlaspi. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Cresses are sowne in gardens, it skils not what soile it be; for that they like any ground, especially 
if it be well watered. M. Bowles found the fourth growing in Shropshire in the fields about 
Birch in the parish of Elesmere, in the grounds belonging to M. Richard Herbert, and that in 
great plenty. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
It may be sowne at any time of the yeere, vnlesse it be in Winter; it groweth vp quickly, and 
bringeth forth betimes both stalke and seede: it dieth euery yeere, and recouereth it selfe of the 
fallen or shaken seed. 
 
1 Nasturtium hortense. 
Garden Cresses. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Cresses is called in Greeke [^GREEK OMITTED^]: in Latine 
Nasturtium; in English Cresses: the Germaines call 
it kersse: and in French, Cresson: the Italians, Nasturtio, 
and Agretto: of some, towne Cresses, and 
garden Karsse. It is called Nasturtium, as Varro and 
Plinie thinke a narribus torquendis, that is to say, of 
writhing the nosthrils, which also by the loathsome 
smell and sharpnesse of the seede doth cause 
sneesing. The first is called Nasturtium hortense, 
Garden Cresses. 2 Nasturtium hortense crispum, Garden 
Cresses with crispe, or curled leaues. 3 Nasturtium 
Hispanicum, or Latifolium; Spanish Cresses, or 
Broad-leaued Cresses. 4 This is Nasturtium petræum 
of Tabernamontanus (and not of Lobell, as our 
Author termed it.) Stone Cresses. 
 
[}The Temperature.}] 
 
The herbe of garden Cresses is sharpe and biting 
the tongue; and therefore it is very hot and 
drie, but lesse hot whilest it is yong and tender, by 
reason of the waterie moisture mixed therewith, by 
which the sharpenesse is somewhat allaied. 
 
The seede is much more biting then the herbe, 
and is hot and drie almost in the fourth degree. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
[/55./] 
Galen saith that the Cresses may be eaten with 
bread Velutiobsonium, and so the Antient Spartanes 
vsually did; and the low-Countrie men many times doe, who commonly vse to feed of Cresses 
with bread and butter. It is eaten with other sallade hearbes, as Tarragon and Rocket: and for 
this cause it is chiefely sowen. 
 
It is good against the disease which the Germaines call Scorbuch and Scorbuye: in Latine, 
[/56./] 
Scorbutus: which we in England call the Scuruie, and Scurby, and vpon the seas the Skyrby: it is 
as good and as effectuall as the Scuruie grasse, or water Cresses. 
 
Dioscorides saith, if the seed be stamped and mixed with hony, it cureth the hardnesse of the 
[/57./] 
milt: with Vineger and Barley meale parched it is a remedie against the Sciatica, and taketh away 
hard swellings and inflammations. It scoureth away tetters, mixed with brine: it ripeneth felons, 
called in Greeke, [^GREEK OMITTED^]: it forcibly cutteth and raiseth vp thicke and tough humors of the chest, 
if it be mixed with things proper against the stuffing of the lungs. 
 
Dioscorides saith it is hurtfull to the stomacke, and troubleth the belly. 
 
[^p.251^] 
3 Nasturtium Hispanicum. 
Spanish Cresses. 
[^An illustration of a plant omitted.^] 
 
4 Nasturtium Petreum. 
Stone Cresses. 
[^An illustration of a plant omitted.^] 
 
It driueth forth wormes, bringeth downe the floures, killeth the child in the mothers womb, 
[/58./] 
and prouoketh bodily lust. 
 
Being inwardly taken, it is good for such as haue fallen from high places: it dissolueth cluttered 
[/59./] 
bloud, and preuenteth the same that it do not congeale and thicken in any part of the body: 
it procureth sweat, as the later Physitions haue found and tried by experience. 
 
[}CHAP. 13. Of Indian Cresses.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
CResses of India haue many weake and feeble branches, rising immediately from the ground, 
dispersing themselues far abroade; by meanes whereof one plant doth occupie a great circuit 
of ground, as doth the great Bindeweede. The tender stalkes diuide themselues into sundry 
branches, trailing likewise vpon the ground, somewhat bunched or swollen vp at euery ioint 
or knee, which are in colour of a light red, but the spaces betweene the ioints are greene. The 
leaues are round like wall peniwort, called Cotyledon, the footestalke of the leafe commeth forth 
on the backeside almost in the middest of the leafe, as those of Frogbit, in taste and smell like the 
garden Cresses. The flowers are dispersed throughout the whole plant, of colour yellow, with a 
crossed starre ouerthwart the inside, of a deepe orange colour; vnto the backe part of the same 
doth hang a taile or spurre, such as hath the Larkes heele, called in Latine Consolida Regalis, but 
greater, and the spurre or heele longer; which being past there succeed bunched and knobbed 
cods or seede vessels, wherein is contained the seede, rough, browne of colour, and like vnto the 
seedes of the beete, but smaller. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
The seedes of this rare and faire plant came first from the Indies into Spaine, and thence into 
France and Flanders, from whence I receiued seede that bore with me both flowers and seede, 
especially those I receiued from my louing friend Iohn Robin of Paris. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
The seedes must be sowen in the beginning of Aprill, vpon a bed of hot horse dung, and some 
[^p.252^] 
fine sifted earth cast thereon of an handfull thicke. The bed must be couered in sundry places 
with hoopes or poles, to sustaine the mat or such like thing that it must be couered with in the 
night, and layd open to the Sunne in the day time. The which being sprung vp, and hauing gotten 
three leaues, you must replant them abroad in the hottest place of the garden, and most fine 
and fertile mold. Thus may you do with Muske-Melons, Cucumbers, and all cold fruits that require 
haste; for that otherwise the frost will ouertake them before they come to fruit-bearing. 
 
They may also be sowen in good mold like as other seeds, and vsually are. 
 
Nasturtium Indicum cum flore & semine. 
Indian Cresses with floure and seed. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
This beautifull plant is called in Latine, Nasturtium Indicum: in English, Indian Cresses. Although 
some haue deemed it a kinde of Conuolvulus, or Binde-weed; yet I am well contented that 
it retaine the former name, for that the smell and taste shew it to be a kinde of Cresses. 
 
[}The Nature and Vertues.}] 
 
We haue no certain knowledge of his nature or vertues, but are content to refer it to the kindes 
of Cresses, or to a further consideration. 
 
[}CHAP. 14. Of Sciatica Cresses.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 SCiatica Cresses hath many slender branches growing from a stalke of a cubit high, with 
small long and narrow leaues like those of Garden Cresses. The floures be very small, 
and yellow of colour, the seed-vessels be little flat chaffie huskes, wherein is the seed 
of a reddish gold colour, sharpe and very bitter in taste. The root is small, tough, white within 
and without, and of a biting taste. 
 
The plant whose figure I here giue you in stead of that with the narrower leaues of our Author, 
hath leaues somewhat like Rocket, but not so deepe cut in, being only snipt about the edges: 
[^p.253^] 
the vpper leaues are not snipt, nor diuided at all, and are narrower. The floures decking the tops 
of the branches are small and white, the seed vessels are lesse then those of Cresses, and the seed it 
selfe exceeding small, and of a blackish colour; the root is woody, sometimes single, otherwhiles 
diuided into two branches. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
It groweth vpon old wals and rough places by high waies sides, and such like: I haue found it in 
corne fields about Southfleete neere to Grauesend in Kent. 
 
Iberis Cardamantica. 
Sciatica Cresses. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
It floureth according to the late or earely 
sowing of it in the fields, in Iune and Iuly. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Sciatica Cresses is called in Greeke [^GREEK OMITTED^], and 
[^GREEK OMITTED^]: in Latine Iberis: of Plinie, Heberis, and 
Nasturtium syluestre, and in like manner also Lepidium. 
There is another Lepidium of Plinie: in 
English, Sciatica Cresse. The first described 
may be called Iberis Cardamantica tenuifolia, 
Small leaued Sciatica Cresses. The second, 
Iberis latiore folio, broad leaued Sciatica Cresses. 
 
[}The Nature.}] 
 
Sciatica Cresse is hot in the fourth degree, 
and like to garden Cresses both in smell and 
in taste. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
The rootes gathered in Autumne, saith Dioscorides, 
[/60./] 
doe heate and burne, and are with 
good successe with swines grease made vp in 
manner of a plaister, and put vpon such as are 
tormented with the Sciatica: it is to lie on 
the grieued place but foure hours at the most, 
and then taken away, and the patient bathed 
with warme water, and the place afterwards 
anointed with oile, and wooll laid on it; which 
things Galen in his ninth booke of medicines, according to the place greeued, citeth out of Democrates, 
in certaine verses tending to that effect. 
 
[}CHAP. 15. Of Banke Cresses.}] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
1 BAnke Cresses hath long leaues, deepely cut or jagged vpon both sides, not vnlike to 
those of Rocket, or wilde mustard. The stalkes be smal, limber or pliant, yet very tough, 
and wil twist and writhe as doth the Ozier or water willow, wherupon do grow small 
yellow flowers, which being past there do succeed little slender cods, full of small seedes, in taste 
snarpe and biting the tongue as those of Cresses. 
 
2 The second kinde of banke Cresses hath leaues like vnto those of Dandelion, somewhat 
resembling Spinach. The branches be long, tough, and pliant like the other. The flowers be 
yellowish, which are succeeded by smal long cods, hauing leaues growing amongst them: in these 
cods is contained small biting seed like the other of this kinde. The smell of this plant is very 
vngratefull. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Banke Cresses is found in stonie places among rubbish, by path waies, vpon earth or mudde 
walls, and in other vntoiled places. 
 
[^p.254^] 
The second kinde of banke Cresses groweth in such places as the former doth: I found it 
growing at a place by Chelmes forde in Essex called little Baddowe, and in sundrie other places. 
 
If our Author meant this which I haue described and giuen you the figure of, (as it is probable 
he did) I doubt he scarce found it wilde: I haue seene it in the garden of Master Parkinson, 
and it groweth wilde in many places of Italy. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
They flower in Iune and Iuly; and the seed is ripe in August and September. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Banke Cresses is called in Latine Irio and Erysimum: in Greeke [^GREEK OMITTED^], and of some, [^GREEK OMITTED^] according 
to Dioscorides: Theophrastus hath an other Erysimum. The first is called Irio, or Erysimum by 
Matthiolus Dodoneus, and others. Turner, Fuchsius and Tragus call it Verbena fmina, or recta. The 
second is Irio alter of Matthiolus, and Saxifraga Romanorum, Lugd. It may be called Italian Banke 
Cresses: or Roman Saxifrage. 
 
1 Erysimum Dioscoridis, Lobelij. 
Bancke Cresses. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
2 Erysimum alterum Italicum. 
Italian bancke Cresses. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Nature.}] 
 
The seed of bancke Cresses is like in taste to garden Cresses, and is as Galen saith of a fierie 
temperature, and doth extreamely attenuate or make thinne. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
[/61./] 
The seed of bancke Cresses is good against the rheume that falleth into the chest, by rotting 
the same. 
 
[/62./] 
It remedieth the cough, the yellow jaundise, and the Sciatica or ache of the hucklebones, if it 
be taken with hony in manner of a lohoc and often licked. 
 
[/63./] 
It is also drunke against deadly poisons, as Dioscorides addeth: and being made vp in a plaister 
with water and hony and applied, it is a remedie against hidden cankrous apostumes behind 
the eares, hard swellings and inflammations of the pappes and stones. 
 
[/64./] 
The seeds of the Italian Banke Cresses, or Roman Saxifrage taken in the weight of a dram, 
[^p.255^] 
in a decoction of Grasseroots, effectually cleanse the reines, and expell the stone, as the Authour 
of the hist. Lugd. affirmes.

[}CHAP. 16. Of Docke Cresses.}] 
 
Lampsana. 
Docke Cresses. 
[^An illustration of the plant omitted.^] 
 
[}The Description.}] 
 
DOcke-Cresses is a wilde Wort or 
pot-herbe hauing roughish hairy 
leaues of an ouerworne greene colour, 
deepely cut or indented vpon both sides 
like the leaues of small Turneps. The stalkes 
grow to the height of two or three cubits, and 
sometimes higher, diuiding themselues toward 
the top into sundry little branches, whereon do 
grow many small yellow floures like those of 
Hieracium, or Hawke-weed; which decaying, are 
succeeded by little crested heads containing a 
longish small seed somewhat like Lettice seed, 
but of a yellowish colour: the plant is also milkie, 
the stalke woody, and the root small, fibrous, 
and white. 
 
[}The Place.}] 
 
Dock-Cresses grow euery where by Highwaies, 
vpon walls made of mud or earth, and in 
stony places. 
 
[}The Time.}] 
 
It floureth from May to the end of August: 
the seed is ripe in September. 
 
[}The Names.}] 
 
Docke-Cresses are called in Greeke, [^GREEK OMITTED^] 
in Latine, Lampsana, and Napium, by Dodonæus: 
Tabernamontanus calleth this, Sonchus syluaticus: 
Camerarius affirmes, That in Prussia they call it 
Papillaris. 
 
[}The Nature.}] 
 
Docke-Cresses are of nature hot, and somewhat abstersiue or cleansing. 
 
[}The Vertues.}] 
 
Taken in meate, as Galen and Dioscorides affirme, it ingendreth euill iuyce and naughtie nourishment. 
[/66./] 
 
Camerarius affirmeth, That it is vsed with good successe in Prussia against vlcerated or sore 
[/67./] 
breasts. 
[/68./]
