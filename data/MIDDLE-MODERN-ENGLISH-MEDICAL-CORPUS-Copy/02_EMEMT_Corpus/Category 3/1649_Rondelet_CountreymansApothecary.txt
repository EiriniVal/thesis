OR, 
A Treatise of Succedanea's, 
One Ingredient used for another in 
the administring of Physick. 
 
The learned worke of William Rondeletius 
sometimes Regius Professor 
Monspeliensis. 
 
Translated into English for publique good.}] 
 
AFter I had a long time considered and 
enquired concerning those Ingredients 
which Physitians use in administring 
Physick, instead of such as are prescribed, 
but are not to be got (commonly termed Succedanea;) 
at length I lighted upon the Treatise of 
that most learned man, and famous Practitioner 
William Rondeletius concerning the same; which I 
thought fit to publish in English, for the generall 
good of my native Countrey, as a Piece very profitable 
and usefull; and have for the easier finding 
them out digested the Simples into an Alphabeticall 
order, that so the benefit may be the greater. 
 
Physicians are often forced to use one Simple in 
the place of another; for every soile doth not 
bring forth all Simples, nor can they everywhere 
meet with most proper Ingredients. In the Countrey 
[^p.2^] 
they are forced to use such Simples as are at 
hand; and in asmuch as upon sudden occations proper 
Ingredients are not at hand, but the present 
must be used, therefore they must necessarily make 
choice of such Simples as may with most safety be 
administred instead of those which are most proper, 
but cannot at present be had; as we read Galen 
did, and that with good successe, in the like case; 
For wanting Euphorbium to draw forth stings out of 
the flesh, he did instead thereof take from the Hives 
Propolis, that which Bees make at the mouth of 
their Hives to keep out the cold. 
 
These Succedanea are now more necessary then 
ever they were; both because at this day we want 
many of those simples which ancient Physicians did 
prescribe, and made use of, being they were supplied 
with a plentifull and fertile increase thereof 
in their own Countreys, Eastern and Forraigne; 
and also for that counterfeit, and (by the crafty invention 
of Jews and Merchants) adulterate Medicines 
are transported, which if we reject, we must 
of necessity substitute others in the place thereof; 
besides many ancient simple Medicaments, formerly 
well known, and very common, are at this day 
exolete, and grown out of knowledge. Very many 
usefull compositions were devised and found out 
by the Arabians, and most soveraigne remedies of 
great use among them, the Simples whereof (by 
reason of the barbarousnesse of their terms) are 
altogether unknown unto us. For we are ignorant 
what they mean by those uncouth strange names, 
or else want the Simples themselves. 
 
But in the choice and use of these Succedanea, 
that most pernicious custome among Physitians is 
deservedly to be rejected, which hath now for 
many yeeres been much in use, though to the great 
prejudice and wrong of Patients; in which, in 
[^p.3^] 
compounding Medicines, they confusedly mingle 
all such Drugs which are commended or prescribed 
usefull in such a disease to be applied to the 
part affected, or but soveraine for some symptome; 
so that having made use of all of the same quality, 
they have not left unprescribed one Herbe or Drug 
which may be used instead of another; whereas, if 
they would content themselves with one, two or 
three Herbs, the Apothecary would never be destitute 
of Succedanea; But because quantity will be 
necessary, for one handfull adde two; for two, 
three or foure, & c. Hence will ensue a double benefit; 
first, the more certain working of the Physicke, 
and a more easie and speedy preparing thereof; 
and secondly, the greatest grace of his Art, the 
Physitian will appeare to abound with variety of 
Drugs and Succedanea, when in his Recipies he can 
double, vary, and change his Drugs, and to understand 
more then the ordinarysort of Mountebanks 
and Empericks. As for example, if in his decoction 
he hath prescribed Borrage, but in defect thereof 
substitutes wild Buglosse or contra; again if garden 
Endive be wanting, to prescribe the Juice or Syrope 
thereof; if Succory be not to be had, to prescribe 
Lyons tongue or Broad-leafe, for ground 
Pine, Germander, or contrary; but what shall the 
Apothecary doe, if he prescribe all Drugs in one 
and the same Recipe? certainly it will prove no other 
then that Poeticall Chaos, a rude and indigested 
lump. 
 
Let them consider and continually call to mind 
that of Villanovanus; it is deceit, cousenage to 
use compounds where simples may be easily had. 
 
Let them leave off that bad custome, and avoyd 
it as a dangerous rocke; let them likewise beware 
of naughty, covetous, dishonest, unlearned, and 
unskilfull Apothecaries, who greedy of wealth and 
[^p.4^] 
profit, commend an hodge-podge of even halfe 
rotten and putrified Drugs. Some do this that they 
may boast their store, or else out of ignorance or 
pride; and if any learned Physitians do it, it is that 
they may not seem to be lesse experienced in the 
knowledge of Drugs, then in the vertue and use 
thereof. 
 
Lastly, since there are some wholsome and fit 
compositions, by experience and reason received 
and approved, invented by ancient Physitians, we 
ought to search out, approve, and provide some 
Succedanea, that so soveraigne and excellent medicines 
may be prepared, which in that respect are 
no waies to be refused and rejected, because with 
such good successe some Succedanea, not inferiour 
to the simples prescribed, may with equall benefit 
accomplish and effect all the promises of genuine 
or naturall Physicke. 
 
Let your Succedanea be as neere as may be, of 
the same genus and species, nature and kind.

The Drugs that 
are to be used 
one instead of 
another, whether 
in inward 
or outward causes 
	must agree in 
	vertues & operations 
	both 
		secret 
		and 
		manifest, 
	and in consistence, 
	and be alike 
	in 
		taste

[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
Some Drugs may by change be used in outward 
remedies which are not to be used in inward applyings, 
as the Juice of Carline Thistle may be used 
for the Juice of Lettice outwardly, but must not be 
taken for it inwardly, because it is poyson. 
 
Sometime not the whole simple, but some parts 
must be substituted, or used instead of another as 
[^p.6^] 
in a Muccago Mussilage of the seed of the Herbe 
Fleabane for a Muccago Mussilage of the seed of 
Quinces: all the seed of the Herb is not to be 
used, because the inward part thereof differs in 
temperament from a Mussilage, and is thought to be 
venemous; nor may the Quince Apple be used for 
the seed of the Quince, because they differ in operation 
and consistence. 
 
Some recipeis or prescriptions in some remedies 
may be used instead of one another, as a conserve 
for the syrrop of the same simple whether of fruit, 
flower or root: as the conserve of Maidenhaire may 
be used for the syrrop of the same in opiates- 
but in the prescribing of the syrrop it cannot be 
so, because the forme or rule of the Physick will 
not permit it: For liquid druggs must be used instead 
of liquid, therefore if the syrrop be prescribed 
and not at hand, the destillation or decoction 
of the Herb is to be used instead thereof. 
 
In some Candids or preserves, we may use the 
syrrop of the conserve, because they are conserved 
in the syrrop, as the syrrop of the conserve of Lemons, 
for the syrrop of Lemon pill; the syrrop of 
the Conserve of the roote of Buglosse, for the syrrop 
of Buglosse. 
 
Emplaisters and oyntments may be mutually 
used one for another; in case the part affected may 
be found to admit thereof: as the plaister of filii 
Zacharie, for the resumptive oyntment, and 
contra: but in the paines of the breast or stomack 
unlesse the stifnesse thereof be dissolved, or otherwise 
mollified, it is not to be used, because plaisters 
when they are laid on, hinder the ribs from dilating, 
enlarging themselves, and the freenesse of 
breathing. A plaister of Cerusse or white lead, 
for unguentum album, unlesse the inflammation doe 
forbid it, which will not admit of neither hard nor 
stiffe remedies. 
 
[^p.7^] 
[}Divers other medicines may be used instead one of t=he= 
other; provided that their vertue and operation b=e= 
the same.}] 
 
PIlls may be used instead of confections, and 
contra. as Hiera simply or aloes for the pils 
made of it, and the Herbe Benedicta or holywort, 
and contra. for Pills to purge Phlegme, electuary 
diacarthame purgative with Lemon: for Pills to 
purge choler or melancholy, electuary of the 
juice of Roses and contra; so that the quantity of 
every one be observed. The doses of the Hiera 
and such like Electuaries are to be augmented by 
reason of the quantity of honey, which doth allay 
the strength of the Physick. 
 
A Syrrop, for Eclegma or a lohoch, if it be taken 
by dissolving in the mouth: as the syrrop of Jujuba 
for Lohoch sound and approved, the syrrop of 
Poppeyes for Diacodion. 
 
A powder for a Trochiscus and contra. as the 
species of Diarrhodon for the Trochus of Diarrhodon, 
a Trochus of Squills, for a Lohoch of the same, 
the quantity being either augmented or diminished 
according to the nature and quality of the disease 
and the scope of Physick 
 
In simples sometimes the parts are not strictly 
observed, as Turbith the root for Agarick in a Trochus, 
and contra. Thus a simple may be put for a 
composition or contra. as Colocynthis wild gourds, 
or Colloquintida in a lesse quantity, for Agarick; 
and a double or treble dose of wild Saffron for Agarick, 
and contra. And yet a simple Medicine 
for this use to be put in the place of another is 
hard to be found, which can truly, everyway 
and in every part agree as Avicennas testifies, because 
two simple medicines in case of want of others 
of like vertue and efficacy can scarce safely 
[^p.8^] 
be applyed instead thereof. Which since it proves 
so difficult, he did apply sometime two, sometime 
three of equall weight and measure, sometime in 
a doubled and trebled medicine, the fift or eight 
part of another Medicine being added; because 
(saith he) there are very few medicaments which 
are wholely like others in temperament and operation, 
or the same in consistence in grossenesse or 
thinnesse of the parts, and in other the hidden 
properties. 
 
[^Beginning of a flowchart figure.^] 
The use of 
druggs or medicaments 
in 
compositions 
is various and 
changeable in 
respect, either 
	Of 
		The heat 
		the coldnesse 
		the 
		moistnesse 
		the drinesse. 
			In the beginning 
			of the first, 
			or in the middle 
			and first degree, 
			and so of 
			the rest. 
	Or 
		Of the parts the 
		clamminesse, the 
		taste, the smell, 
		the colour. 
			the grossenesse. 
			or the thinnesse. 
[^End of a flowchart figure.^] 
 
And therefore that which is like another in 
temperament, ofttimes differs from it in the 
grossenesse or thinnesse of the parts, or some other 
faculty and quality; as some thinke they may use 
Galanga or sweet cane for Folesfoot, or wild Spikenard, 
& yet they do not agree in every operation; 
for galanga can onely provoke urine, and bring 
downe womens courses, and therefore to be supplied 
for Spikenard in prescriptions to provoke 
them: it hath no vertue to cause vomitting as 
Spikenard hath. In like manner the Hyacinth 
may be used instead of Anchusa or Buglosse Orchanet: 
but if there be need of Anchusa for the Colour, 
as in oyntments, the Hyacinth is not proper: 
but instead thereof, dyers lacca or Red gum; Brasile, 
[^p.9^] 
red Santalum, Painters Lacca or red gum, 
or scarlet Dye. Assa dulcis or that sweet gumme 
is not to be used for Assa fœtida because of the 
smell, as Avicennas did in the griefe of the wombe, 
so by a sweet smell to have forst it upward, 
but it drawes towards sweet, flies from stinking 
sents or smells. 
 
Some druggs are used for taste; which yet are 
not convenient in every particular, as Honey, and 
Manna may be used for Sugar in some sorts of remedies 
as in laxative medicines, but in no wise in 
binding receits; for Manna is more loosening 
then either Sugar or Honey. Muccus a Mussilage, 
is usefull in a bloody Flux, and is used for a Lenior. 
Fenegreek, which makes a Mussilage 
but hot, and therefore not to be used in spitting 
of blood, as in externall remedies, as in the inflammation 
of the upper skin of the eyes, in which 
the white of an egge is preferred in the beginning 
and increase of the griefe, but in the stay and 
declining thereof a Mussilage fenegreeke is commended. 
 
Those druggs which may be made use of instead 
of others, are not yet to be added in every sort of 
remedies; as Myrrhe may be used for Bdellium 
in Pills and oyntments, but in Pills made of Bdellium 
it must in no wayes be added, for Myrrhe 
causeth a greater Flux of blood and of the Hemerods, 
as also of womens courses. Therefore in 
those druggs that are substituted this rule is to be 
observed, that the supposititious drugg, that is used 
in the Room of the adulterate genuine drugg, can 
effect the same which the genuine should, whether 
it be to heate, to coole, to make moist, to dry, to 
bind, to loose, or to concoct. For Wormewood 
(simply taken) Sea Wormewood, or Southernewood 
may be used; for Sea Wormewood, or 
[^p.10^] 
Wormewood of Mount Taurus, Roman may be 
used; For Roman, the Wormwood which growes 
in the place where thou dwellest. 
 
This may be done in the choise of all Herbs, 
they may be of any Countrey, yet let your choise 
be of such an one as is an Herb of the neerest bordering 
Country, or at least of the same temperature, 
of which sort is Craux vulgarly Gallo a Province 
of Creet, where growes the best and greatest 
store of our narrow leafe Thyme and Epithymon 
or that which growes oft upon it. In the second 
place Herbs of moist Countreys, if it be a 
scortching Summer, may be used for Herbs of an 
hot Countrey, which Galen informes us he did in 
preparing a Theriace or remedy against Poyson, 
using the rocke-parsley of another Countrey for 
Macedonian rock parsley; and yet the temperature 
of the Country ought to be observed, for the 
Countrey doth very much adde to, or diminish 
from the vertue and goodnesse of the medicament; 
for the Sclavonian Flower deluce we may use the 
Venetian, and for the African the Florentine.

And lastly, all herbs of the same species or sort 
may be used for another, unlesse something discovered 
forbid, as in Perwinkle or which Dioscor. 
writes that one sort gripes or frets, another loosens 
the belly, another gathers and removes choller 
& phlegme, but the chief sort staies womens courses, 
and the Dysentery or bloody-flux. So the wilde 
Cucumber and Garden melons, and Colocynthis 
differ in their operation; but this is wont to be 
found in very few herbes. 
 
Also heed is to be taken to the parts; for some 
differ in their qualities, as the root Medium decocted 
stayes womens courses, being taken for certain 
daies: but the seed thereof taken in Wine brings 
them down. The seed of Juniper may be taken inward, 
but the shavings are discovered to be deadly 
to kill. The Juice of the herb Coriander is thought 
to be mortall, and yet the seed medicinall. Therefore 
it is better for Physitians to use universals at 
no time, but rather particulars; for, for the most 
[^p.15^] 
part there is the greatest difference betwixt those 
which would be thought the neerest.
