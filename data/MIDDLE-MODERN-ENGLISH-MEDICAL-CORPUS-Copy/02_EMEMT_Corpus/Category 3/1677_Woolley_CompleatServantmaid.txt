[}Directions for such who intend 
to be House-keepers to Persons 
of Honour or Quality.}] 
 
THose persons who would qualifie 
themselves for this employment, must 
in their behaviour carry themselves grave, 
solid and serious; which will inculcate into 
the beliefs of the persons whom they are to 
serve, that they will be able to govern a Family 
well. They must endeavour to gain a 
competent knowledge in Preserving, Conserving, 
and Candying, making of Cates, 
and all manner of Spoon meats, Jellies and 
the like. Also in distilling all manner of 
Waters. They must likewise endeavour to 
be careful in looking after the rest of the 
Servants, that every one perform their duty 
in their several places, that they keep 
good hours in their up-rising and lying 
down, and that no Goods be either spoiled 
or embezelled. They must be careful also, 
that all Strangers be nobly and civilly used 
in their Chambers, and that your Master or 
[^p.36^] 
Lady be not dishonoured through neglect or 
miscarriage of Servants. They must likewise 
endeavour to have a competent knowledge 
in Physick and Chyrurgery, that they 
may be able to help their Mamed, sick and 
indigent Neighbours; for commonly, all 
good and charitable Ladies make this a part 
of their House-keeper's business. 
 
[}Directions for Distilling of Waters}] 
 
[}To make Aqua mirabilis.}] 
 
TAke three pints of White Wine, of Aqua 
vitæ and juice of Celendine, of 
each a pint; one dram of Cardamum, one 
dram of Mellilot-flower, Cubebs a dram, 
of Gallingal, Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace, Ginger, 
of each a dram: Mingle all these together 
over night; the next morning, set them 
a stilling in a glass Lymbick. This admirable 
Water dissolveth the swelling of the 
Lungs, and restoreth them when perished: 
It suffereth not the Blood to Putrifie, neither 
need he or she to breath a vein, that useth 
this excellent Water often. It cureth the 
Heart-burn, and expelleth Melancholy and 
[^p.37^] 
Flegm, it expelleth Urine, and preserveth 
a good colour in the face, and is an utter enemy 
to the Palsie. Take three spoon-fuls 
of it at a time, morning or evening, twice 
a week. 
 
[}To make Dr. Stephens his Famous Water.}] 
 
Take a Gallon of Gascoin Wine, of Ginger,

into the Wine, and so let it stand sixteen 
hours, stirring it now and then; then distil it, 
in a Limbick, with a soft fire. The first pint 
of the Water by it self, for it is the best. 
 
The principal use of this Water is against 
all old Diseases; it preserveth Youth, comforteth 
the Stomach, cureth the Stone, of 
what nature soever, using but two spoonfuls 
in seven days. It preserved Dr. Stephens 
ten years Bed-rid, that he lived ninety 
eight years. 
 
[^p.38^] 
[}An excellent Water for the Eyes.}] 
 
Take a new laid Egg and roast it hard, 
then cut the shell in the midst, and take out 
the yolk, and put some white Coperas where 
the yolk was; then bind the Egg together 
again, and then let it lie till it begin to be 
a Water; then take the White forth from 
both sides the Egg, and put the same into a 
glass of fair running Water, and so let it 
stand a while, then strain it through a fair 
Linnen Cloth, and keep it close stopped in 
a glass; and therewith wash your eyes morning

small, and put them into a narrow mouthed 
pot, and put to them five quarts of White 
Wine; stop it close, and let it stand three 
days and nights, stirring it morning and evening; 
then take the Herbs from the Wine, 
and distill them in an ordinary Still; and 
when you have distilled the Herbs, distil 
the Wine also; wherein is Vertue for a weak 
Stomach. Take three or four spoonfuls at 
any time.

[}To make Mint-Water}] 
 
Take two parts of Mint, and one part of 
Worm-wood, and two parts of Carduus; 
put these into as much new Milk as will soak 
them: Let them infuse five or six hours, 
then distil it as you do Rose-Water; but 
you must often take off the head and stir 
the Water well with a stick. Drink of this 
Water a Wine-glass full at a time, sweetned 
with white Sugar to your taste. 
 
[}To make a very good Cordial-Water: 
without stilling.}] 
 
Take two quarts of Brandy, and keep it

Liquorish, of each of these half 
an ounce bruised; Long Pepper and Grains, 
of each one dram bruised, Elecampane one 
[^p.41^] 
quarter of an ounce bruised: Let all these 
steep in the Brandy a fortnight; then pour 
it out into a long glass softly, so long as it 
will run clear: then put more Brandy into 
the glass where the Ingredients are, and let 
that stand three weeks; and so long as you 
find there is any strength in the Ingredients, 
still put in more Brandy, and let it stand every 
time longer and longer. Then take 
your first two quarts of Brandy which you 
poured of, and put in it four ounces of white 
Sugar-candy, and so much Syrup of Clove-Gilliflowers 
as will colour it, with store of 
Leaf Gold: Give two spoonfuls at a time.

to drive out any infection and venomous 
humours. 
 
[}To make Poppy-Water.}]

them in a common Still; then let the distilled 
Water be poured upon fresh flowers, and 
repeated three times; to which add two 
Nutmegs sliced, Red Poppy flowers a pugil, 
White Sugar two ounces; set it to the fire to 
give it a pleasing sharpness, and order it according 
to your taste. 
 
[^p.42^] 
[}To make Rose-Water.}] 
 
Stamp the Leaves, and first distil the 
Juice, afterwards distil the leaves; and so 
you may dispatch more with one Still, than 
others with three or four; and this Water is 
every way as Medicinable as the other; serving 
well in all Decoctions and Syrups, 
though it be not altogether so pleasing to 
the smell. 
 
[}To make Spirits of Roses.}] 
 
Bruise the Rose in his own juice, adding 
thereto, being temperately warmed, a convenient 
proportion, either of Yeast or Ferment; 
leave them a few days to ferment, 
till they get a strong and heady smell near 
like to Vinegar; then distil them, and draw 
so long as you find any scent of the Rose to 
come; then distil again so often, till you 
have purchased a perfect Spirit of the Rose. 
You may also ferment the juice of Roses only, 
and after distil the same.

and keep the first Water, for it is best. Of

1. It is good to heal any wound inward 
or outward, being squirted warm into the 
inward wound, being applyed to the outward 
wound with fine lint or linnen, anointing 
also those parts thereabouts, it 
not only taketh away the pain, but also 
keepeth it from any inflammation, and also 
draweth forth all broken bones, or any 
other thing that might putrifie or fester it, 
so that the brains or inwards, as the Liver, 
Guts, nor Heart be not troubled, it will heal 
it in four or five days dressing, so that nothing 
else be applied thereunto. 
 
2. It healeth any burning or scalding, 
and healeth also any bruise or cut, being 
first anointed with the said Oyl, and a piece 
of Linen cloth or Lint dipt in the same, being 
warmed and laid into the place, it will 
heal it without any scar remaining. 
 
3. It helpeth the head-ach by anointing 
the Temples and Nostrils therewith.

any other beast.

being never so deep in any part of the body, 
being applied as aforesaid is directed for a 
cut.

being used as in a cut, but it will require 
longer time to help them. 
 
9. It is good for one infected with the 
Plague or Meazles, so as it be presently taken 
in warm broth, the quantity of a quarter 
of an ounce four mornings together and

10. It helpeth digestion, anointing the 
Navel and Stomach therewith when the 
party goeth to bed, it will stanch any blood 
of a great wound, by putting a plaister of 
Lint therein, and tying it very hard. 
 
11. Take the quantity of a Nutmeg in

of Olive of the best, of good red Lead one 
pound, white lead one pound well beaten 
to dust, twelve ounces of Spanish sope, and 
incorporate all these very well together in

an earthen pot, well glazed before you put 
them to boyl, and when that they are well 
incorporated that the sope cometh upward, 
put it upon a small fire of Coals continuing 
it on the fire, the space of an hour and an 
half, still stirring it with an iron ball upon 
the end of a stick, then make the fire something 
bigger, until the redness be turned 
into a gray colour, but you must not leave 
stirring till the matter be turn'd into the colour 
of Oyl or somewhat darker, then drop 
it upon a wooden Trencher, and if 
it cleave not to the finger it is enough, then 
make it up into Roles it will keep twenty 
years, the older the better.
