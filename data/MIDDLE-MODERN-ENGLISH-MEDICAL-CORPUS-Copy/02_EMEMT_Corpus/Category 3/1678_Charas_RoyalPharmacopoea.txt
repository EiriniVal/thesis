[}CHAP. I. 
Of Juices.}] 
 
I Shall not here stay upon Juices or Liquors which may be drawn out of Animals, 
as Blood, Flegm, Urine, Serosities, Sweat, &c. Nor upon those which may be 
drawn from their parts by assation, pressing, or otherwise, as the Gravies, and 
Liquors of Meats, &c. Nor upon such as are to be drawn from the stock of Minerals, 
as Oyl of Petroleum, or Naphta, and several bituminous matters, but only upon 
the Juices of Plants. 
 
The Juice is the same in Plants, as the blood in Animals: and it may be defin'd to 
be a liquid substance, which making a part of the composition of Plants, communicates 
to the rest of the parts, that which is necessary for their support, as also for their 
growth. This Juice issues out sometimes of it self, sometimes it is drawn forth by incision, 
or some other way more artful. This Juice is more or less liquid, according to 
the several concoctions which it has received from Nature, either in the Plant, or above 
or without the Plant. It is sometimes Watry, sometimes Winy, sometimes Oyly, 
Gummy, Rosiny, Bituminous. It is also sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, eager, 
sharp, insipid. And as sometimes it has no scent, sometimes it is odoriferous, sometimes 
it stinks, sometimes it is black, sometimes white, green, blew, yellow, red, &c. It 
is also more or less abounding, according to the Nature and condition of the Plant. 
Sometimes it is so inwardly united, and so profoundly conceal'd among the other substances, 
as not to be perceiv'd by the ordinary senses, nor be distinguish'd but by separating 
it by the means of fire. Such are the Juices or Liquors which issue from the 
dryer sort of Woods in Distillation, as also the Juices drawn from the Horns and 
bones of Animals, though seemingly very dry. The Juice is also sometimes mix'd with 
[^p.53^] 
substances so viscous, and tenacious, though soft, that it cannot be separated but by the 
means of fire. Nevertheless, these juices are not to be taken barely and purely, for 
that part which I have called Flegm, and which I have acknowledg'd for one of the five 
principles, of which every mixt body ought to be compos'd; for sometimes they themselves 
are compos'd of some or other of the other principles, which is easie to prove 
by the separation which the Artist may make thereof. 
 
In which respect, I am not of the opinion of those that make the Juices, which issue 
out of Plants of themselves, to be Excrements. For then the most essential part of the 
Plant would be taken for an Excrement; and if it were an Excrement, it ought to be 
rejected. And yet we gather very carefully, purchase very dear, and use to good advantage 
these pretended Excrements, as Myrrh, Bdellium, Tacamahacca, Storax, Benjamin, 
Natural-balsom, and several others which the Plants throw out of their barks, and which 
cannot but be accounted the best part of their composition. But now of those Juices 
that are to be prepar'd, and depend upon the skill of the Apothecary. 
 
These Juices are drawn almost from all parts of the Plants; some by cutting the 
bark, to be afterwards dry'd in the Sun, as are the Juices of Scammony, Aloes and Poppy: 
Others by bruising and pressing. Thus as well Oyls as Aqueous Juices, are drawn 
from several Herbs and several Flowers; several Fruits and several Seeds. Such are the 
Juices of Carduus, Endive, Succorie, Burrage, Bugloss, &c. for Herbs. The Juices 
of Roses, Violets, Peach-flowers, red Poppies, &c. for Flowers. The Juices of Mulberries, 
Apples, Cherries, red Goose-berries, Barberries, &c. for Wine-Fruits. The 
Juices of Olives, Walnuts, Small-nuts, Almonds, Pine-apples, Pistaches, &c. for Oily 
Fruits. The Juices of the four greater cold Seeds, as also from the Seeds of Poppies, 
Danewort, Henbane, Marjoram, &c. for Oily Seeds. The other Juices are drawn by 
the addition of some Liquor; which cannot be avoided when the parts of the Plant are 
dry by accident, or that they have not moisture enough in themselves. Such are the 
Juices of Senna, Rhubarb, Angelica, Liquorice, Hellebore, &c. which are drawn forth 
by the addition of Liquor, and which being filter'd, are evaporated over a small fire; 
to the consistency of an Extract, of which they bear the name, and of which I shall speak 
in the Third Part of this Pharmacopœa. 
 
Generally we bruise in a Marble-Mortar, or made of some hard-stone, with a Pestle 
of Wood, the Herbs, the Flowers, the Fruits, the Seeds, out of which we intend to 
draw the Juices, and then put them into a strong Cloth, or Bag, and squeeze out the 
Juice, either with your hands, or in a Press between two flat-pieces of Tin, Iron, or 
Wood. Then we let the Juice stand for some days, or else we expose it some days to the 
Sun; and then we pour out the clearest softly by inclination; and keep it so, or else 
strain it through Hippocrates breeches; or through some cloth-strainer, if the Juice be 
not clear enough, or if it be aqueous. The Juices of Herbs which are to be first made 
use of, or which ought to be clarify'd and boil'd with Sugar, or honey, or to be mingl'd 
and boil'd with Oyntments, and Emplaisters, have no need of all this care. But the 
Wine-Juices of Fruits must be well-clarify'd. For they must first be expos'd to the Sun, 
then strain'd, to the end that by that heat and digestion, and by that straining the grosser 
parts of the Juice may be separated from the pure. These Juices are to be run 
through a bag, or rather through brown-paper, and they may be boil'd up with 
Sugar or honey, or be kept in bottles fill'd up within a small matter of the top; which 
vacancy must be fill'd with Oyl of sweet Almonds, to hinder the air from getting in 
and putrifying the Juice. However, after that, be careful to stop the bottles well, and 
to keep them in a place moderately cool, to make use of as occasion serves: At which 
time pour away the Oyl, and make use of the pure Juice, throwing away the feces. 
The Juices of Roses, and Peach-flowers, require the same care as the Wine-Juices. 
 
Take notice that in drawing forth Acid red Juices, particularly that of Granates, 
you must do it in Glass-Vessels, or Gally-pots, or of glaz'd Earth, have your hands very 
clean, and take an especial care that no Iron come near it, for fear of spoiling the 
colour. The Juice and also the Syrup of Kermes require the same care, for they lose 
their colour in Vessels of Iron or Copper. 
 
To draw forth the Juice of certain viscous Plants, such as are Purslain, Burrage, 
Bugloss, and the like, the best way which I have found, is to put them whole into a 
Copper-Bason, tinn'd within, over a moderate Charcoal-fire, and there to keep them, 
stirring them from time to time, till some part of the Juice be got together at the bottom 
of the Bason. Then separate this Juice by inclination; and set the Bason again upon 
the fire, and continue to keep it there and to stir the herbs, and to separate the Juice 
[^p.54^] 
by inclination, till you have Juice enough. By this means you will have less trouble, 
have sooner done, and the Juice shall be much more pure, then by bruising the Herbs. 
I refer the Oylie-juices of Fruits and Seeds till I come to speak of Squeez'd-oyls. 
 
[}CHAP. II. 
Of Infusions, and Decoctions.}] 
 
I Thought it best to discourse of Infusions and Decoctions immediatly after Juices, 
by means whereof the more succulent and essential parts of Medicaments are imparted 
to the Liquors. Besides, Decoctions and Infusions are made use of in so many 
Galenical Compositions, that I deem'd it convenient to give some general Rules, before 
I go any farther. They are sometimes made use of to soft'n and boyl Medicaments, 
and sometimes to take away or correct some bad quality: but their chiefest use 
is to communicate their Vertue to some Liquor, and to unite and assemble in one Liquor 
the Vertue of several Medicaments joyn'd together. 
 
Infusions differ from Decoctions in degree of heat, and time in boyling. For Infusions 
are oft-times made without fire: and when there is any need of it, it must be 
very moderate, and require a long time; sometimes for several hours, sometimes for 
several days. Whereas Decoctions are at an end in a quarter, half, or a whole hour, 
and that the longest seldom exceed five or six hours. I have joyn'd these two Preparations 
together, by reason of the great affinity which they have one with another; 
and for that many times Infusions precede Decoctions. 
 
Decoctions differ according to the Substance of the Mixt-body which you are to 
boyl. For such Mixt-bodies as are of a compact substance and hard to penetrate, require 
a longer boyling, then they that are of a middling substance; and these again 
require more boyling then those that are of a tender substance. The same diversity 
of Substances requires also less or more Liquor. For there must be more for Medicaments 
that require long boyling, then for those that require less: For a long Decoction 
requires much moisture. The ordinary proportion is six times the weight of 
Liquor to the Substance boyl'd. But if the matters be of a compacted substance, you 
may make use of eight, nine or ten times the weight in Liquor. And if the Substances 
are very solid indeed, you may advance to twelve or sixteen times the weight of Liquor. 
You must also take notice that Medicaments of a compact Substance will endure a more 
violent fire and longer boyling then those of a middling or a tender Substance: and some 
there are which are not put into the Decoction, till you are ready to take it off the 
fire. Others there are which have only need of a bare Infusion to communicate their 
Vertue to the Liquor. So that it is absolutely necessary for an Apothecary to know the 
various Substances of Medicaments, to judge by that how he ought to regulate their Infusion 
or Decoction; because that Prescriptions never mention the regulation of the 
Decoction, nor the degrees of fire, nor the length of time requisite for the Decoction, 
which is all left to the prudence of the Apothecary. 
 
And now to proceed in order; When you are to make a Decoction of several Medicaments, 
you must begin with the most solid, such as are Woods, then put in Roots 
and Barks, after that Fruits; next to them Herbs, Berries and Seeds; Flowers must be 
reserv'd to the last. You must rasp, or bruise or cut very small the Woods, Roots and 
Barks, slit the Fruits, chop the Herbs, and bruise the Berries and Seeds, and put in the 
Flowers as they are. 
 
This Rule however is not so general but that it may have its exception. For a wood 
of a thin and spungie Substance requires less boyling then a wood more close and solid. 
Barley whole endures as much boyling as wood. On the other side Aromatic-roots 
and woods will not endure long boyling; but the better parts will dissipate. Barks, 
Fruits and Aromatic-seeds, require only a bare Infusion. Liquorice-root is put in after 
the Herbs. The Maidenhairs, or Capillaries, at the same time with the Liquorice or 
immediately after. The Cold-seeds at the same time as the Flowers. The Flowers of 
the Water-Lilly endure as much boyling as the Herbs. 
 
You must observe the same order in the Decoctions of Animals; for the Horns and 
Bones require longer boyling then the Flesh. Beef requires more boyling then Mutton, 
Mutton then Veal or Capon, and both more then young Pullet. 
 
[^p.55^] 
These general Rules will be much more demonstrable in the progress of these Discourses. 
And though the various examples of Decoction which you will meet with, 
might suffice, I will not omit to give you here certain Examples, which will serve for 
certain Decoctions, which have been prescrib'd without putting down the Medicaments 
of which they ought to be compos'd.

The Raw-Tartar is prescrib'd in this Decoction, as well to communicate to the Water 
the vertue of the Medicaments therein prescrib'd, as to retain in some sort their 
volatile parts; and to prevent dissipation during the Decoction. And though I do not 
contradict the opinion of those that would avoid boyling the parts of Aromatic Plants, 
especially in uncover'd Vessels; nevertheless I believe we may yet allow something to 
[^p.57^] 
the ancient Customs, provided there be requisite care tak'n. The Roots of Peonie, 
Valerian, Orrice and Acorus are to be well bruis'd, as also the Misletoe of the Oak, 
and the raw Tartar, and then put into an Earthen glaz'd pot, with the quantity of 
water prescrib'd: and having cover'd the pot, boyl the Decoction over a gentle fire, 
during a small quarter of an hour; then put in the cut Herbs, and covering the pot, let 
them boil a quarter of an hour longer: then put in the berries and seeds, and cover the 
pot again, and after having given them four or five wambles more, put down the flowers 
into the Decoction, cover the pot, and take it off from the fire; and when it is half 
cold, strain it gently from the sediment. 
 
[}CHAP. III. 
Of Juleps, and Apozems.}] 
 
I Shall not go about here to set down the Juleps of Roses, and Violets of the Ancients, 
nor any other of the same Nature, as being now out of use; their consistency and 
name being now chang'd into those of Syrups. I shall only say that the name of Julep 
has been formerly given to certain liquid compositions, made with distill'd Waters, 
or slight Decoctions, which are boil'd with Sugar, to a consistency much thinner 
then that of Syrups: For they had no design to keep them, but prepar'd them as they 
had occasion. The name of Julep is still now-a-days giv'n to certain Remedies, which 
have some agreement with the Juleps of the Ancients; but they are less sweetn'd with 
Sugar, and less fit to keep: For usually they never put above an ounce of Sugar, or an 
ounce and a half of some Syrups, to six or eight ounces of some distill'd Waters, of 
some decoction, or some other Liquor. We never boil these Liquors with the Sugar 
or Syrups, but only mingle them together when they are to be given to the patient, 
who may drink them as their ordinary drink, abating some thing of the quantity of Sugar 
and Syrups mix'd therewith. All these Juleps may be made tart with Spirits or Acid 
Juices. But they will not keep above twenty-four hours in the Summer in a cool 
place, and not above two or three days in the Winter. 
 
Apozems are Medicines very near the Nature of Juleps: But they admit of a greater 
Number of Medicaments, which render them less pleasing. They are seldom compos'd 
of any thing but the Decoctions of the various parts of plants. And hence it 
is, that they have deriv'd their Name. For the Greek word [^GREEK OMITTED^], signifies to 
boil, from whence [^GREEK OMITTED^], Decoctum, or, a thing boil'd. I could insert here several 
Examples, but I refer the Reader to the Decoctions of the preceding Chapter, which 
may be call'd Apozems. We may add purgative Medicines to these Decoctions, 
and dissolve therein several Syrups, as they are intended for this or t'other Disease. 
 
[}CHAP. IV. 
Of Emulsions and Almond-Milks.}] 
 
EMulsions are liquid Medicines very pleasing to the taste, whose colour and consistency 
is very like to that of Milk. They are usually compos'd of Seeds, or Oily 
Fruits, beat'n in a Marble-Mortar, with a Woodd'n-pestle, and then dissolv'd in distill'd 
Waters, or in slight Decoctions, which you must strain and press out, and 
sweeten with Sugar or Syrups. 
 
Emulsions are prepar'd for several purposes, especially to temper the excessive heat of 
the Lungs, and of all the Brest; to take off the sharpness and acrimony of the humours, 
and to asswage the boiling of the Blood, the heat of the Urine, and the Reins. For which 
reason they are us'd not only in stoppages of the Urine, and in Gonorrhea's, but also in 
Inflammations of the Natural parts of those that are troubl'd with Venereal Distempers. 
They are also successfully us'd to temper the excessive heat of the Entrails, and to provoke 
sleep and rest. Emulsions are also very proper to sweet'n the Acrimony of the 
Humours in Dysenteries, to asswage pains, and heal Excoriations. Of all which 
[^p.58^] 
things it will be convenient to give some examples; and first, for the Distempers of the 
Lungs, and Brest.

into those of White-poppy and Water-Lillies.

Almond-Milks, Butters are easie to make; known to, and made use of by several

The usual way is to prepare them of two ounces of blanch'd-Almonds, which must 
be stamp'd exactly in a Marble-Mortar with a Woodd'n-Pestle, afterwards dissolv'd in 
eight or ten ounces of the decoction of barley cleans'd, or in the Water where Veal 
or Pullets have been boyl'd. Then strain and press the whole, and add to the straining 
an ounce of fine Sugar, and never so little Rose-water, or if you please, Orange-flower-water. 
You may add an ounce of Syrup of Violets, Water-Lillies, or White-poppy 
instead of Sugar if there be occasion. 
 
[}CHAP. V. 
Of Potions, Mixtures, and Bolus's.}] 
 
POtions are so call'd, because they are to be drank. The Materials of them are very 
various, by reason of the different Indications, Judgements, and insight of them 
that prescribe them; for that may be call'd a Potion which is as ill prepar'd, as that 
which is well prescrib'd, and as well prepar'd. Besides Purgative-Potions are as well 
to be accompted potions, as those which are accompted Astringent or Cordial, Sudorific, 
or Diuretic, &c. As Potions are not made without liquors; those which are 
made use of are sometimes simple, as fair Water, Wine, Milk, Whey, &c. and 
sometimes waters distill'd, Infusions, Tinctures, Decoctions, Juices, &c. Sometimes 
several liquors are mingled, one among another. Sometimes also to these liquors are 
added Powders, Salts, Opiates, Confections, Magisteries, Elyxirs, Oyls, Essences, &c. 
Juleps, Apozems, Emulsions, Almond-Milks, and Diets, may be call'd Potions as well 
as Medicines. We also prepare Potions Emetick, Diaphoretic, Pectoral, Cephalic, 
Somniferous, Anodynes, Aperitives, Diuretics, Cordials, Stomachical, Hepatical, 
Splenetic, Hysteric, Vulnerary, Arthritick, Carminative, Dysenteric, and for several other 
purposes: So that Potions may be made after a thousand fashions for every Disease, 
since we may make use of various Remedies and different Doses according to the 
intention of the Physician. 
 
That which many modern Physicians call Mixture, may be reckon'd in the same rank 
with Potions. But Mixtures differ in this from Potions, that their use is more frequent 
and longer, and because there is not so much drank of them at a time; for being compos'd 
of powerful Medicines, they operate in less quantity, and work those effects by 
repetition, which could hardly be done at once taking. These Mixtures are usually a 
mixture of distill'd Waters, more or less, compounded of Elixirs, distill'd-Oyls, volatile, 
fix'd, or Essential Salts, Spirits, Tinctures, Essences, Extracts, pretious Stones, 
[^p.60^] 
Syrups, and many other Remedies, well-chosen, and well-proportion'd in their Doses, 
which are to be taken from time to time in a little Spoon, in the Intervals between the 
Patients meals. 
 
The difference of Mixtures may be very great, according to the diversity and complication 
of Diseases, and the Judgement of the Physicians, that prescribe them. 
Mixtures are also sometimes made of a more thick consistency, not much unlike that of 
ordinary Opiates, which is for the accommodation of such Patients, as cannot take 
Remedies in Drink. These Medicines may be compos'd of the same Medicaments 
made use of in the preceding mixtures, excepting the Liquors, instead whereof we put 
Conserves or Confections: They are given upon the point of a Knife, or wrapt up in 
Wafers, or otherwise. 
 
Bolus's are internal Remedies, usually a little more solid then Opiates; invented 
meerly for the benefit of such Patients as cannot indure to swallow liquid drinks, or 
cannot away with their scent or taste. They are also profitable to make the best advantage 
for the swallowing of certain Medicines, whose weight would keep them always 
at the bottom of the Glass, were they mingl'd in liquor, as in several preparations of 
Mercury and Antimony: There may be as much diversity in Bolus's, as in Potions. 
They make them of Electuaries, Confections, Conserves, Pulps, Powders, Salts, Oyls, 
Essences, Extracts, Syrups, and an infinite sort of Medicines, of which there must be 
some that are solid and dry enough to thicken those that are too liquid, or too soft. 
Bolus's are taken usually a good while before meals, sometimes upon the point of a 
Knife, but generally wrapt up in Wafers, powder'd Sugar, or powder of Liquorice, 
Fruits roasted or raw, or some confection, or other substance that prevents the Bolus 
from being either smelt or tasted. 
 
[}CHAP. VI. 
Of Gargarismes, Masticatories, and Errhines, or Tents 
to put up into the Nostrils.}] 
 
GArgarisms, are liquid Medicines, design'd for Diseases of the Throat, Mouth, Palate, 
and Gums, as also to free the Head from excessive moisture. They are usually 
compos'd of distill'd waters or decoctions, wherein they mix sometimes Salts, 
sometimes Spirits, Syrups, Honeys, Vinegar, and sometimes several Juices. Gargarisms 
are never swallow'd, but only gargl'd and held for some time in the mouth, then spit 
out again, continuing the use thereof as long and as often as necessity requires. These 
Gargarisms are as well known, and as usual as any other sort of Medicine, and 
there are enough to be found in several Authours, to spare the swelling of these 
Sheets. 
 
Masticatories, are also call'd Apophlegmatismes, because their chief work is to 
bring down flegm from the Brain. For which purpose we make use of several simple 
Drugs, and particularly of divers parts of Plants, as roots of Orrice, Pellitory of Spain, 
Cyperus, or English Galenga, true Acorus, or Aromatic-reed, Grains of Staves-acre, 
Cubebs, Cardamom, all the Peppers, Mustard, Rocket, Sage, Rosemary, Mastick, Time, 
Savory, Tobacco, &c. which Medicines being chaw'd, by their heat and acrimony have a 
peculiar qualitie to draw down flegm from the Brain, and to void it by the mouth. Trochisques 
may be also made thereof by pulverizing them, and incorporating them with 
Oxymel, or Syrup of Cassidony, to hold in the mouth, and to masticate when they are 
dry: or else to make thereof a kind of paste, to tye up in a Linnen-Cloth like a knot 
and so to champ them between the teeth. 
 
Errhines are so call'd, as being Medicines design'd to be put up into the Nostrils. 
They were invented for the same use as Apophlegmatismes. But they operate with 
more force, because they carry their vertue directly to the Brain, through the Conduits 
of the Nostrils, and powerfully stir up and move the Expulsive faculty. Errhines are 
sometimes liquid, and proper to be snufft up through the Nostrils; sometimes in Powder, 
to be either snufft up, or blown into the Nostrils; sometimes like a thin Oyntment, 
and sometimes like a Tent small at one end. Liquid Errhines are usually made of 
the Juices of Marjoram, Betony, Sage, Roots of Beets, Sow-bread, Orrice, &c. Or of 
[^p.61^] 
the Decoctions of the same Plants, or of Lettice, or Lillies of the Valleys. The Powders 
are made of Marjoram, Betony, Orrice, Nicotian, Oleander, Colts-foot, white-Ellebore, 
and Euphorbium, upon some extraordinary accompts: Those that are made 
up in Liniments will admit the same things into their compositions; and must be incorporated 
with Oyl of Roses or Orrice, and a little wax, or with Oyl of Laurel. The 
more solid Errhines are chiefly to stop bleeding at the Nose: They are usually compos'd 
of Balausts, or the Flowers of the wild-Pomgranate-tree, of Bole of the East, Terra 
sigillata, Mastick, and Man's-blood or Swines-blood dry'd; or of some such 
kind of astringent Medicaments pulveriz'd, and incorporated with the white of an 
Egg or Down of a Hare, to make Tents thereof to be put up and held in the Nose. 
Some there are that make an addition of white-Vitriol. 
 
[}CHAP. VII. 
Of Injections, and Pessaries.}] 
 
INjections are liquid Medicines sometimes injected into the private parts of Nature, 
and sometimes into wounds: Clysters may be also call'd Injections. The ingredients 
are different, according to the difference of the Distemper. Wine, Distill'd-waters, 
Lime-waters, Sea-waters, Spirit of Wine, Milk, Whey, Oyls, Balsoms, and 
several other Liquors; as also several Juices, and divers Decoctions and Infusions of 
several parts of Plants, and several Minerals. Usually Syringes are made use of for the 
application of these Injections, and they must be always warm'd before they be us'd. 
Sometimes several Ingredients and Preparations are dissolv'd in these Liquors, as Salts, 
Powders, Extracts, Syrups, Honeys, Trochisques, Gums, Elixirs, and several other 
things, according as necessity requires. Sometimes also we dip Tents, Feathers and 
Bolsters into Injections for the cure of Wounds. 
 
Under the name of Pessaries, are comprehended all Medicines not liquid, which are 
put up into the Secret-parts of Women. But by the word Pessary, strictly tak'n, is to 
be understood a sort of solid Medicine, about a fingers length, sometimes somewhat 
bigger, which is put up into the Secret-parts with a Riband fasten'd to one end. These 
Pessaries are made pyramidical, round, close and smooth, for fear of hurting the parts. 
These Remedies are prepar'd for several purposes; the chief of which are to provoke 
the menstruum's, or to stop them: to hinder the falling down of the Matrix, to 
cure Fluxes against Nature, or to heal Ulcers, or other mischiefs that may happ'n to 
those parts. The Body of the Pessary is made of some slight polish'd-wood, or some 
piece of Linnen made up close and hard; cover'd with a kind of Sheath of Velvet, or 
some other Silk-stuff, the seams whereof cannot hurt. Then fill the Velvet with Cotton 
or Wool, that it may be as hard as if it were of Wood or Cork; and daub all the 
outside of the Pessary with some Liniment, or some other mixture proper for your purpose. 
Pessaries may be also made of Lead, hollow like a little Cane, and cover'd with 
Velvet, like the former. In all which there must be a difference observ'd between Maids 
and Women; as well in reference to the hardness, as the bigness of Pessaries, appropriating 
the lesser and softer to the first. 
 
Aromaticks that are sweet and free from acrimonie are very proper to render Pessaries 
effectual: whether it be to consume the vapours of the Matrix, or to op'n the passages, 
and to provoke the menstruums: For we observe that good Smells seem to comfort 
that part. For which reason such Liniments where Musk, Ambergrise, Civet, and 
other good Smells are mix'd, are successfully us'd upon those occasions. Though you 
must be very careful not to let them come near the Noses of some Persons, upon whom 
those Sweet-smells would work a contrary effect. The Bodies of Pessaries prepar'd to 
stop the menstruum's, are made up with astringent powders, very finely pulveriz'd, incorporated 
with Wax and Oyl of Mastick melted together, fill'd into some piece of thin 
Taffaty, and anointed without-side with the same Oyl. These Pessary's are very good 
to stop extraordinary losses of Blood, and the falling of the Matrix. If the Pessaries 
are design'd for the cure of any Ulcer, or any other disease in the neck of the Matrix, 
the Pessary must be anointed with some Linement or convenient Medicine in that part 
which is most able to reach it. 
 
[^p.62^] 
[}CHAP. VIII. 
Of Clysters, and Suppositories.}] 
 
CLysters, call'd by the Greeks Enemata, are also Injections, and liquid Medicines, 
injected through the Fundament into the Intestines, for the cure or ease of several 
Maladies. They are call'd Clysters or Washings, because their use is to wash the 
Intestines. 
 
Clysters are prepar'd for several purposes, sometimes to cool the Intestines, sometimes 
to moist'n them; sometimes to soft'n and soak the harden'd excrements, or to 
stir up the expulsive Faculty, to dispel the wind, to asswage pains, to facilitate the Expulsion 
of the Urine, to draw forth or kill the Worms, to ease Women in Labour; 
to provoke their menstruum's, and to appease Hysteric-passions, to asswage tormenting 
Gripes, and to make a diversion of Humours or Vapours, which flie to the Head, Stomach, 
Brest, Reins, or any other parts of the Body. 
 
Clysters are usually compos'd of the Decoctions of Roots, Herbs, Seeds and Flowers, 
of different vertue, according to the intention of the Physician. The Decoctions are 
for the most part made in fair Water, but many times in Milk, Whey, Meat-broths, 
ordinary Spanish-wine, Urine, Oxycrat, Hydromel, and several other Liquors. 
And besides the ordinary Roots and Flowers, which are boyl'd for Clysters, 
many times there is an occasion to mixe Laxatives, such as are Senna, Coloquintida, 
Rhubarb, and many others, and to dissolve therein the Strain'd-decoctions of Opiats, 
Honeys, Syrups, Sugar, Salts, Yolks of Eggs, Turpentine, Oyls, Extracts, and many 
other things, which it would be too tedious to repeat. The forms of Clysters are so 
familiar, that it is to no purpose to insert them. 
 
Suppositories are solid Medicines about the length and bigness of the little Finger, 
round and pyramidical. They were invented for the convenience of those who have an 
aversion to Clysters, or of such whose Sickness and constitution will not admit of them. 
The ordinary ingredient of Suppositories is Common-honey, Bay-salt, Salt-gemme, or 
Aloes, or Coloquintida in powder, or some Hiera, or Laxative Electuary. Sometimes 
Suppositories of Sope cut round and small at the end will suffice. Some there are 
that make use of Muscardins, or bits of Paste made of Gum-Tragacanth, Rose-water 
and Musk. So that in these things every one is at liberty to make choice of what he 
likes best. 
 
[}CHAP. IX. 
Of Wines.}] 
 
ALL the World knows that the Grape is the Fruit of the Vine; and that Wine is the 
Juice of the Grape; but this Juice would not be true Wine, did it not undergo 
a Fermentation; and if the subtle parts had not by that means been separated from the 
grosser, and by that means were not become capable of operating as they do: Not 
that their Fermentation gives to the subtle parts of the Wine their utmost purity. For 
that requires other means, as you shall hear in the third part of this Work; and therefore 
I shall here at present only describe the preparation of two sorts of Wine most in 
use, the first of which may serve as an Example how to prepare any other. 
 
[^Beginning of a list in two columns.^] 
[}Vinum Absinthii.}] 
 
+R. Summitat. floridarum siccarum Absinthii

in doliolum, quod pintas Parisienses quinquaginta 
aut circiter contineat. Impleatur dolium

qua per acta, quod per fermentationem deperditum 
est Vino suppleatur, & diligenter dolio obturato, 
servetur Vinum. 
 
[^A column change.^] 
[}Wormwood Wine.}] 
 
+R. Of the Flowrie drie-tops of the bigger 
or lesser Wormwood, Fasc. j. Shred them 
and put them into a little Vessel containing 
fifty pints of Paris, or thereabouts. Fill 
the Vessel with the Juice or Vine-clusters 
newly press'd forth, and set the Vessel into 
a Wine-Cellar to ferment. The Fermentation 
being over, supply the waste of the Fermentation 
with Wine: then carefully stopping 
up the Vessel, keep the Wine. 
[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
[^p.63^] 
They that can endure the bitterness of Great-Wormwood, may make choice of it for 
the preservation of this Wine: But the nicer sort choose the little, whose vertues are 
no less then those of greater. Take the Flowerie-tops, and having weigh'd out the quantity 
prescrib'd, shred them and put them into a little Bag, which is to be so fasten'd 
to the bung-hole, as to hang in the midst of the Liquor. Place the Vessel in the Cellar, 
fill it with the Juice of clusters newly squeez'd, and let it stand for two months, during 
which time the Wine will ferment and be fully charg'd with the smell, taste and vertues 
of the Wormwood. When the Ebullition of the Wine is over, fill up with white-wine, 
burnt-wine, or Spanish-wine the waste of the Fermentation: Then stop up the 
Tub, and keep the Wine for your use. 
 
The Juice of the New-gather'd-grapes is to be preferr'd before all sorts of Wine, 
for the preparation of Wormwood-wine, and of all compound Wines; because that 
Juice being newly squeez'd forth, by subtilizing and disengaging it self from its terrestrial 
parts by Fermentation, penetrates more inwardly the ingredients which are 
put into it; and operates more effectually then a wine could do already fermented, 
whose subtle parts are subject to dissipation. For this Juice loses nothing to speak of 
in its Fermentation with the Wormwood; but the same flegm which the ordinary wine 
loses in its own. And in the mean time by means of the heat which the Fermentative-spirits 
excite in it, it is better able to penetrate the body of the wormwood, and to 
charge it self with its vertue, then otherwise it would be. By this means also it may 
be kept a long while, provided the Vessel were full and close stopt. 
 
Wormwood-wine is very much commended against the Diseases of the Stomach 
and Liver, especially proceeding from a cold cause. It dissipates wind and crudities, 
it helps and increases the appetite, kills worms, resists putrefaction; helps concoction 
and distribution of the nourishment, and consumes bad humours. It brings down 
the vapours that rise from the Matrix, and op'ns its obstructions, and is very proper for 
the Green-sickness, and to provoke the menstruums. Take three or four ounces in a morning fasting, for several days, as you find it requisite.

[^A column change.^] 
[}Stibiated Wine, vulgarly Emetic; or 
apt to provoke vomiting.}] 
 
+R. Of Glass, Regulus of Antimony, or 
if you had rather, Crocus Metallorum, or 
Magnesia Opalina, finely powder'd +o iij. 
Spanish-wine or strong French-white-wine 
two Paris-pints: Put them together in a 
Glass-bottle, and the Bottle being carefully 
stopp'd, let them macerate eight days in a 
temperate place, and let them be oft'n 
stirr'd; and at length let them be all kept 
together, that when it is to be us'd, the 
clear wine that swims above the Antimony, 
may be pour'd forth by inclination, and 
so tak'n. 
[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
Having Glass or Regulus of Antimony, or Magnesia Opalina, well prepar'd and 
finely beat'n upon a mortar, it is an easie thing to prepare Emetic-wine. For it is 
sufficient to get a good Glass-bottle, and to put the prepar'd Antimony into it, and 
to pour the prescrib'd quantity of wine into it, then to stop up the Bottle, to set it 
in a temperate place, to shake it from time to time for seven or eight days together, 
and to keep the wine and the Antimony together in a Bottle well-stopp'd, to make 
use of as occasion serves, pouring out by inclination, and taking the clear wine that 
swims above the Antimony, to such a quantity as is requisite; taking care not to raise 
the bottom, for fear some part of the Antimony should mixe with the wine. Upon 
which this observation is to be made, That the prescrib'd dose of wine and Antimony 
need not be too religiously observ'd. For though there should be a little more or a 
little less of the one or of the other, it would not signifie much, since oft'n Experience 
teaches us that the wine takes to it self no more of the vertue of the Antimony, then 
it is able to receive; and that the lying with the Antimony one, two or more months, 
as the wine might do, renders it nothing more strong then that which has lain but 
eight days, if it be oft'n shak'n. 
 
[^p.64^] 
You shall observe also that the same powder of Antimony, upon which the wine has 
staid a long time, and which has imparted its Emetic and Purgative Quality to it, is still 
able to impart as much vertue to more new wine, if macerated with it, and that after 
that wine is sufficiently strong of the Antimony, and spent, the same Powder will serve 
again several times for the same use. And that if you be but careful always to pour out 
the wine gently, and to take always only the clear, you shall find very near the same 
weight of the powder as at the first maceration; which is more confirm'd by the trial 
which we make of Cups of Regulus of Antimony, which will give a Purgative and Emetic 
Quality to the wine, which shall be fill'd and kept in them but for some few hours: and 
then again bequeath the same vertues to new wine in the same space of time, and will 
still afford the same qualities to other wine, as long as the life of one, or several men 
continues to make tryal of it, without perceiving in the Cup any diminution of its 
weight or vertue. 
 
Emetic Wine purges upwards and downwards ill humours, especially those that are 
bred in the Stomach. It operates with more or less violence according to the constitution 
of those that take it, or according to the superfluity or small quantity of matter 
which it meets with. And therefore it is much more proper for persons that are full 
of humours, then for those that are not so much troubled with them, and it is better at 
the beginning then at the end of a sickness, when the Patient is weak. It may be given 
alone from one, to two, three, or four ounces, a good distance before Meals, according 
to the Age, Strength, and Nature of the Disease. It may be mingled also among 
Purgatives. Where note, that if the Purgatives are too strong and exceed in 
quantity the Emetick-wine, then it acts as they act, and works only downwards. But if 
it surmount the Purgatives in quantity and strength, it constrains them to work as that 
does, upwards and downwards. 
 
Emetic-wine is never giv'n to those that are narrow-Chested, nor to those that are 
hard to vomit, or if there be any fear of any Inflammation of the Bowels. 
 
[}CHAP. X. 
Of Vinegars.}] 
 
VVE may say of Vinegar, that the first Original of it is the Juice of Grapes, as 
well as of Wine. But the Juice of the Grape must be made Wine by Fermentation 
before it can be turn'd into Vinegar. And though Vinegar may be made of 
Beer or Cider, as also of water; I hold, that good and true Vinegar is only to be made 
of Wine. Some attribute the only cause of the acidity of Vinegar to the dissipation of 
the volatile Spirits of the Wine. But it seems that they have not sufficiently examin'd this 
business. For they that know the Nature and Original of acids, and the effects which they 
are able to act upon Salts and Spirits, especially upon volatiles, will as much attribute to 
them the turning of Wine into Vinegar, as to the absence of the volatile Spirit of 
Wine. For although before this alteration, some part of the Spirit of Wine may 
chance to be dissipated, yet we are to believe, that the corruption which happens to 
wine, happens through the disproportion of its parts, and that the excess of the acid is 
the chief cause of turning wine into Vinegar. For so long as the flegm, the volatile 
and tartarous parts which contain the acid, keep nigh a just proportion together, the 
Wine continues good. But when any one of those parts predominates, there must of 
necessity happen some corruption, which proves to be more or less according to the 
Quantity and Nature of the part which predominates, which causes very great differences 
in the decay of the Wine. For when the Wine decays through excess of 
flegm, it grows greasie, and turns. But though the flegm be able to enervate the 
force of the volatile part of the Wine by its own corruption, and by its excess, it cannot 
nevertheless destroy it, as it destroys almost entirely the tartarous acid part. 
Whence it comes to pass, that though no good Vinegar can be made of Wines grown 
greasie, and turn'd; Yet in Distillation you may draw from hence as much volatile 
Spirit, as from Wines neither greasie nor sowr. And you might draw from hence 
altogether quite as much, but that the abundance of flegm, which caus'd the corruption of 
the Wine, in part takes up the place of the volatile Spirit. The excess of the volatile 
Spirit happ'ns very rarely to Wine, and though it should exceed the other parts in 
[^p.65^] 
quantity, as it is very able to preserve it self without them, it would never corrupt 
them, but would make the Wine violent and reaking, so that it would be less serviceable 
for common use, and would intoxicate sooner: But when the Tartarous part surmounts, 
it draws to it the nitrous part of the Air, which is in some sort Homogeneous 
to it, and multiplying it self by a little and a little, instead of chasing away the volatile 
Spirit, which it has surmounted in quantity, it unites it self strictly to it, to make it in 
some measure conformable to its own Nature, while the flegm is no longer able to temper 
the acid which has got the upper hand of it. Vinegars by their acidity slack'n the 
activity of the Salts, and volatile Spirits; joyning themselves to them, and altering their 
action; and are successfully made use of in Distempers caus'd by the Salts, and volatile 
Spirits, or by humours that participate of their Nature, chiefly Choleric humours, 
to which purpose acid Fruits and Juices are usually administred with good 
success.

[}Vinegar of Roses.}] 
 
+R. Of dry red Roses, the white being 
nipt off, one pound; of very tart Vinegar, 
lb viij. Put them into a Glass-Vessel 
well stopp'd; set them in the Sun for fifteen 
or twenty days, then strain and press 
them out. Let the straining be again 
set in the Sun during the same time, with 
the like weight of Roses. Let it be 
strain'd and press'd out, and let the Vinegar 
be kept. 
[^End of a list in two columns.^] 
 
Take the great buds of Provence-Roses, and cut away the white part at the bottom. 
Dry the red part in the hot Sun, if it may be done, at least in the Air, as soon as possible 
may be. Take a pound of Roses thus dry'd, and put them into a strong glass-bottle; 
upon which you must pour eight pints of good Vinegar, and having stopt the bottle, 
expose it to the Sun for fifteen days or three weeks; then strain and press out the 
whole, and return the straining to the same Vessel, over a pound of fresh Roses; then 
stop up the bottle, and expose it to the Sun as long as before: then strain the Vinegar 
and squeeze the Roses, and keep the Vinegar for your use. You may, if you 
please, leave the Roses in the Vinegar, and strain it only when you have occasion 
for it. 
 
Vinegar of Roses is as much us'd in Dyet, as in Physick. It cuts, cleanses, tempers, it 
gives an appetite, it provokes sleep being apply'd to the Fore-head, it removes the 
Acrimony of the fix'd Salts, it moderates the activity of the volatile, it kills the Worms, 
stays Vomiting, stays the Operation of Purgatives, cools Inflammations, assists Expectorations, 
and loosens Flegm, stops the Piles being taken inwardly, and applied outwardly; 
resists Putrefaction, and is good to smell to in noisome and Pestilential seasons. It is 
mix'd among several Liquors, as also in Liniments, Unguents and Emplaisters. 
 
Vinegar of Roses may serve as an example for the making of several Vinegars, made 
of Flowers, as of Elder, Gilli-flowers, Rosemary, Sage, Marigolds, &c. But because these 
flowers do not abound so much in moisture as the Rose, you may take the pains to dry 
them, or at least to half-dry them, not to dissipate their good parts.

[}Vinegar of Squills.}] 
 
+R. Two Sea-Onions of an indifferent 
bigness, peel off the outward Rind, and 
take out the heart with a knife made of a 
Reed; the thin slices between the outmost 
skin and the heart divide into parts, 
and expose them for many days to the Sun, 
till the superfluous moisture be consum'd. 
Of those put a pound into a large stone-Jug, 
and pour upon them eight pints of 
very sharp White Vinegar, or rather 
Spirit of Vinegar. Stop the Jug, and set 
it in the Sun for forty days. Then having 
strain'd and squeez'd the thin slices, keep 
the Vinegar for your use.

[^p.66^] 
They that have travelled into Spain and Portugal, have there met with two sorts of 
true Sea-Onions, one of which being white, is call'd the Male; the other being red is 
call'd the Female. The white is usually somewhat the lesser: it is in taste like the red 
one, but a little thought more tart: However the vertues of both are the same. These 
Squills are Onions that grow by the Sea-shore, the Root whereof is large, short, close, 
and bended. In the Months of August and September, they put forth a round, sleek, shining 
stalk altogether bare, of a whitish colour enclining to Grideline, as big as a Man's 
finger, about two Cubits high, surrounded at the top with several little white-flowers enclining 
to purple, growing like an Ear; after which follows a black-seed like that of ordinary 
Onions which is ripe in October and November. The leaves of both Squills are 
like those of a Flower-de-luce, but bigger; they begin to sprout forth in November and 
December, and grow dry and die in May or June. The white is accounted better then 
the red because of the colour. 
 
The drying of the slices was only intended to correct any ill quality which may be in 
them; for as much as all that is dissipated by the Sun, is only a superfluous moisture, void 
of any considerable vertue; and therefore care is tak'n to prevent that superfluous moisture 
from taking away the strength of the Vinegar, and causing it to putrifie, in regard 
there is flegm enough in the Vinegar without having any need to multiply it. 
 
Dioscorides and Matthiolus most highly applaud the vertues of Vinegar of Squills, and 
affirm that by taking three ounces every Morning, two hours before any eating, and taking 
a little walk after it, it will preserve a Man many years in perfect health. That 
he shall never have any Disease in Mouth, Throat or Stomach. That he shall have a 
voice always clear and clean, respiration free, quick sight, hearing good, an excellent 
complexion. That he shall be free from Windiness: That all the parts of the body 
shall do their Offices: That he shall be always fit for business, never have an ill breath; 
shall digest whatever he eats, and turn it into good nourishment, and have a kindly evacuation 
of the Excrements. That it will recover the Pthysical, though far gone; very much 
help the Epileptic, abating the effects of the Disease, and quite taking them at length away, 
if the Disease be new. That it will give ease in the Gout, and diseases of the 
Joynts; open obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, Mesentery, and other parts: and in 
short will procure soundness of health, and a prolongation of Life. But because our 
Physicians seldom prescribe this Vinegar, I have not made Tryals enough to confirm 
what those great Men have writt'n.
