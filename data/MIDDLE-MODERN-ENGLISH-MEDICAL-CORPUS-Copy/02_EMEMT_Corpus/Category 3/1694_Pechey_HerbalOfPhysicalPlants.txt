[}THE 
English Herbal 
OF 
PHYSICAL PLANTS.}] 
 
[}A}] 
 
[}ABele-tree. See Poplar.}] 
 
Adders-tongue, 
in Latin Ophioglosum. The 
Root has many thick Fibres, 
bound together; especially 
if it grows in 
good Ground. It tastes at 
first sweet, but leaves an 
Acrimony and Bitterness on 
the Palate. It has a tender 
Stalk, about an Hand high, 
which sustains one Leaf, 
that is Oyly, and without 
Nerves; sometimes narrow 
and somewhat long, sometimes 
broad somewhat 
round and erect; of a 
sweetish and clammy taste. 
A two-fork'd Tongue rises 
from the Leaf where 'tis 
joyn'd to the Stalk, which 
grows sharp by degrees, 
and is a little indented. 
'Tis common in Meadows, 
and moist Pastures. It 
springs in April, and fades 
in July. 
 
'Tis an excellent Wound-Herb, 
either taken inwardly, 
or outwardly applied. 
For Ruptures, or Bursten 
Bellies, Take as much of 
the Powder of the dry'd 
Leaves as will lye on a Six-pence, 
or less, according to 
the Age of the Party, in 
two Ounces of Horse-tail, 
or Oak-bud-water, sweetned 
with Syrup of Quinces. 
[^p.2^] 
Use it every Morning for 
the space of fifteen Days. 
But before you enter upon 
the Use of this, or any other 
Medicine, the Gut, if it fall 
into the Cod, must be reduc'd 
by a Chirurgeon, and 
a Truss must be worn to 
keep it up, and the Party 
must avoid all violent Motions, 
and lie as much as 
may be in Bed, or on a 
Couch. Fabritius Hildanus 
says, That some have been 
cured of great Ruptures by 
lying in Bed, when they 
could be cured no other 
way. 
 
The Oyl of it, made in 
the following manner, is 
full as good for Wounds 
and Ulcers as that of 
St. John's-wort: Take one 
handful of the Leaves, 
pound them in a Stone-Mortar, 
and boil them in a 
Pint of Oyl of Olives 'till 
they are dry; strain it, and 
keep it for use. 
 
Common Agrimony, in 
Latin Agrimonia. Most 
commonly it has but one 
Stalk, two or three Foot 
high, and sometimes much 
higher. 'Tis round, hairy, 
full of Pith, surrounded 
with Leaves plac'd at a 
distance alternately, above 
an Hand in length. The 
Leaves consist, for the most 
part, of four little Leaves, 
wing'd on both sides, and 
much indented all about; 
they have Veins, and are 
hairy, but the Down is 
not very conspicuous; they 
taste a little acrid, and are 
somewhat styptick. The 
Flowers smell sweet; they 
grow alternately to the 
Shaft, in a long Series; 
and upon the Top-branches, 
like an Ear of Corn. 
They are of a Saffron-colour, 
and are compos'd of 
five Leaves; at the Basis 
of every Leaf there are 
two Ears that embrace the 
Stalk. The Root is blackish, 
thick, and of an astringent 
Taste. 
 
It cleanses and strengthens 
the Blood, and opens 
Obstructions of the Liver; 
wherefore 'tis good in 
Dropsies, for an ill Habit 
of Body, and the Jaundice. 
Let those that are afflicted 
with these Diseases use for 
their ordinary Drink, Ale 
or Beer wherein the Leaves 
[^p.3^] 
of Agrimony have been infus'd. 
For instance; Put 
eight handfuls of the Leaves 
into a Vessel containing 
four Gallons, drink of it 
when it is clear. 'Tis used 
outwardly in Baths and 
Lotions. 
 
The Powder of the dried 
Leaves is much commended 
by Riverius to prevent 
involuntary Urine. Take 
of the Powder half a Dram, 
of Conserve of Roses a sufficient 
quantity; make a 
Bolus to be taken at Bed-time, 
for the space of three 
Weeks. 
 
Alder-tree, in Latin Alnus. 
'Tis large, and spreads 
much if it like the place it 
grows in: The Bark is 
brown, and the Wood redder 
than Elm or Yew; the 
Branches are very easily 
broken; the Bark of the 
Branches is of a brownish 
Colour and spotted, and 
yellowish within, and tastes 
bitter and unpleasant: The 
Wood is white, and full of 
Pith: The Leaves are 
broad, round, and nervous, 
and somewhat like the 
Leaves of the Hasel-tree; 
they are indented, green, 
shining, and clammy. It 
bears short, brown Aglets, 
like the Beech or Birch-tree. 
It grows near Water. 
 
The green Leaves of this 
Tree applied to Tumours, 
discusses them, and takes 
off Inflammations. Being 
put into Travellers Shooes, 
they ease Pain, and remove 
Weariness. A black Colour, 
like Ink, is made with 
the Bark of Alder, rubb'd 
off with a rusty Iron, and 
infus'd in Water for some 
Days. Some use it to 
dye. 
 
Black Alder,in Latin 
Alnus nigra baccifera. 'Tis 
a small Tree, which sends 
forth many streight Twigs 
from the Roots, about three 
Yards high, of the thickness 
of the Thumb, divided 
into tender Branches. 
The outward Bark is 
brown, but sprinkled with 
Sky-colour'd Spots; which 
being taken off, another 
appears of a Saffron-colour. 
The Substance of the Wood 
is clear, and easily broken; 
nigh the middle 'tis 
[^p.4^] 
brownish, and has a great 
deal of Pith. The Leaves 
are somewhat round, and 
end in an obtuse Point, and 
are of a shining dark-green 
Colour. The Flowers are 
small and palish. The Berries 
are first green, then 
red, and at last black, and 
of an unpleasant Taste. 
'Tis often found in moist, 
woody Places. 
 
The yellow and middle 
Bark, beaten with Vinegar, 
cures the Itch in a few 
Days. 
 
The inward Bark, especially 
of the Root, purges 
Watery Humours; for 
which Reason 'tis good in a 
Dropsie: But it ought to 
be dried in the Shade, because 
when it is green it 
occasions Vomiting: And 
the Decoction of it ought 
to stand two or three Days 
before 'tis used. 
 
Alexanders, in Latin 
Hippocelinum. It has a 
thick Root that is white 
within; it smells sweet, 
and tastes acrid, and somewhat 
bitter. The Stalk is 
above a Yard high, full, 
branchy, channell'd, and 
somewhat red. The Leaves 
are larger than the Leaves 
of Marsh-Smallage, and the 
Pieces rounder: They are 
of a deep Green; they 
taste sweetish, and like 
Garden-Smallage. It has 
Tufts or Umbels of white 
Flowers. The Seed is thick, 
black, and channell'd. 
 
'Tis frequently used in 
Broths in the Spring-time, 
to cleanse the Blood, and 
strengthen the Stomach. 
The Root pickled is a good 
Sauce. Half a Dram of 
the Seeds powder'd, and 
taken in White-wine, provokes 
Urine. 
 
Angelica, in Latin Angelica. 
The Herb it self, 
but especially the Root and 
Seed, are hot and dry. It 
opens and attenuates, and 
is Sudorifick and Vulnerary. 
It moves the Courses, 
hastens Delivery, is good 
for Mother-fits, and in malignant 
Diseases, and for 
the Plague; and it expels 
Poison. The Root of it is 
allow'd by all Physicians to 
be very cordial and Alexipharmick. 
 
[^p.5^] 
For Preservation against 
the Plague, the Root, infus'd 
in Vinegar, is to be 
held frequently to the Nose, 
or chew'd in the Mouth: 
For the Cure, Take one 
Dram of the Powder of the 
Root alone, or half a Dram 
mix'd with a Dram of Venice-Treacle, 
every sixth 
Hour, to provoke Sweat. 
 
The Root or the Stalks 
candied, are reckon'd very 
good, being eaten in a 
Morning, to prevent Infection. 
They are also useful 
in cold Diseases of the 
Lungs, and take off a 
stinking Breath. 
 
[}Lozenges to be held in 
the Mouth in the 
Plague-time.}] 
 
Take of the Extract of 
the Roots of Angelica and 
Contra-yerva, each one 
Ounce; of Extract of Liquorish 
three Drams; of 
Flowers of Sulphure, sublim'd 
with Mirrh, five 
Drams; of Oyl of Cinnamon 
eight Drops; of fine 
Sugar twice the weight of 
all the Ingredients; with 
the Mucilage of Gum-Tragacanth, 
made in Scordium. 
water, make Lozenges 
See Dr. Hodges, for the Prevention 
of the Plague, in 
his Book of the London-Pestilence, 
p. 231. 
 
Apple-tree, in Latin 
Malus. The English Apples 
being accounted the best in 
Europe, I will mention particularly 
those that are most 
esteem'd amongst us. 
 
[}First, Those that are 
soon ripe, and soon 
decay.}] 
 
The Gineting, the Margaret 
or Magdalene, the King-Apple, 
the Aromatick or 
Golden-Russeting, the Flax-Apple, 
the Spice-Apple, the 
Summer-Queening, the Gono-farther 
or Cat's-head, the 
Good-Housewife or Bontradue, 
the Giant-Apple, the Pome-water, 
the Summer-Pearmain, 
the Kirton-Pippin or Holland-Pippin, 
'tis called Broad-eye 
in Sussex; the Orange-Apple, 
the Summer-Belleboon, the 
Paradise-Apple, the Famagusta, 
the Codling, the Costard-Apple, 
the Sops-in-Wine. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}Secondly, Winter-Apples, 
and such as 
last long.}] 
 
The Winter-Queening, the 
Quince-Apple, the Winter-Pearmain, 
the Nonesuch, the 
the Pealing, the Leather-Coat, 
the Winter-John, the 
Pome-Roy, the Lording, the 
Julyflower-Apple, the Pear-Apple, 
the Greening, Lones-Pearmain, 
the Green-Russeting, the 
Red-Russeting, the 
Winter-Fillet or Violet, the 
Winter-Belle or Bonne, the 
Oaken-Pin, the John-Apple 
or Deux Ans, the Westbury, 
the Winter-Reed, the Flower 
of Kent, the Winter-Chesnut, 
the Maligar-Apple, the 
Short-Tart, the Pelmell, the 
Thrift, the Winter-Clary, the 
Fig-Apple. 
 
[}Thirdly, The Apples 
that are best for 
making Cyder.}] 
 
The Redstreak, the Bromsberry-Crab, 
the Golden-Pippin, 
the Gennet-moil, the 
Westbury-Apple, the White 
and Red Mast-Apples, the 
John-Apple, the Under-Leaf 
the Winter-Fillet, Elliots, 
Stocken-Apple, Bitter-Scale, 
Claret-Wine-Apple, Arrier-Apple, 
Richards or Grange-Apple, 
Coling-Apple, Olive-Apple, 
Fox-Whelp, Pippins 
and Pearmains mix'd, the 
Gilliflower. 
 
The Vertues of Apples 
are various, according to 
the different Tastes of them. 
Those that are sowre and 
harsh are astringent, and 
therefore are good in Fluxes 
of the Belly: And when 
they are roasted they are 
proper Food for those that 
have Fevers. Sweet Apples 
are somewhat hot, and 
loosening. Such as are a 
little acid, are agreeable to 
the Stomach, and chear the 
Heart. Rotten Apples take 
off Inflammations and Swellings 
of the Eyes. The 
Core of an Apple cut out, 
and a Dram of Frankincense 
put in, and roasted 
with the Apple, and eaten, 
opens Obstructions of the 
Lungs, and is good for 
Difficulty of Breathing. 
The same applied outwardly 
to the Side, eases 
the Pain of it. 'Tis best to 
[^p.7^] 
eat Apples two or three 
Hours after Meals. 
 
[}The Altering Syrup of 
Apples.}] 
 
Take of the Juice of fragrant 
Pippins two Quarts, 
of the Leaves of Garden 
and Wild-Bugloss, of the 
Flowers of Violets, each 
one Pound; boyl them in 
B. M. and clarifie them; 
add seven Pounds of fine 
Sugar, and a Pint of Rose-water; 
boyl them to a Syrup. 
One Ounce of this 
Syrup, taken Morning and 
Evening, is good for melancholy 
People. 
 
[}The Purging Syrup of 
Apples.}] 
 
Take of the Juice and 
Water of fragrant Pippins, 
each one Pint and an half; 
of the Juice and Water of 
Borage and Bugloss, each 
nine Ounces; of the Leaves 
of Oriental Sena half a 
Pound; of Anise and Fennel-seeds, 
each three Drams; 
of Dodder of Crete two 
Ounces; of White Agarick, 
and the best Rubarb, 
each half an Ounce; of 
Ginger and Mace, each 
four Scruples; of Cinnamon 
two Scruples; of Saffron 
half a Dram: Infuse 
the Rubarb with the Cinnamon 
a-part, in White-Wine 
and Juice of Apples, 
each two Ounces: Infuse 
the rest of the Ingredients, 
except the Saffron, in the 
Waters above-mentioned; 
the next Day pour on the 
Juices, and put them on a 
gentle Fire; take off the 
Scum, and strain it; then 
add four Pounds of White 
Sugar, and boyl it to a Syrup, 
the Infusion of Rubarb 
being put to it, and 
the Saffron being tied up 
in a Rag, and dipp'd often 
in it, and squeez'd out. 
This Syrup is a very proper 
Purge for melancholy 
People, but will 
scarce purge enough by it 
self; wherefore take two 
Ounces of it in three 
Ounces of the Decoction 
of Dodder; which see among 
the Vertues of Dodder. 
The Confection of 
Alkermes is made with 
Juice of Apples, and the 
Ointment called Pomatum. 
[^p.8^] 
Cyder is good for the 
Scurvy. 
 
Apricock-tree, in Latin 
Malus Armeniaca. The 
English Apricocks are better 
than the French or Italian, 
and more wholsome than 
the Peach. The Oyl of the 
Kernels is excellent for Inflammations, 
and Swellings 
of the Hemorrhoids; and 
for Pains of the Ears. The 
Kernels eaten, cure the 
Heart-burning. 
 
White Arch-Angel, in 
Latin Laminum album. It 
has many fibrous Roots, it 
creeps awry in the Earth 
like Mint; the Stalks are a 
Foot or two Foot high, 
four-square, and pretty 
large; but they are smaller 
near the Earth, and 
weak, so that they can 
scarce stand alone: They 
are empty, pretty hairy 
and branchy, and have a 
few Joints, and near the 
Earth seem of a Purple 
Colour when the Sun 
shines on them. The 
Leaves are plac'd by Pairs, 
opposite to one another, 
like Nettles; those on the 
Bottom-stalks are plac'd on 
long Foot-stalks, those on 
the Top-stalks on short 
Foot-stalks, and have a 
short soft Down. The 
Flowers encompass the 
Stalks at the Joints; they 
are white, large, and hooded, 
without rather pale 
than white. It flowers at 
the Latter End of April, or 
the Beginning of May. 
 
One handful of the Herb, 
beaten up with Hog's Lard, 
and applied to King's-Evil-Swellings 
in the Neck or 
Throat, discusses them. A 
Conserve of the Flowers is 
much commended in the 
Whites: But the Cure of 
them by the following Method 
is much safer and surer. 
 
Bleed once, and purge 
thrice with two Scruples 
of Pill Coch. Major. Then 
take of Venice-Treacle one 
Ounce and an half, of the 
Conserve of the yellow Pill 
of Oranges one Ounce, of 
Diascordium half an Ounce, 
of Candied Ginger and 
Nutmegs, each three 
Drams; of the Compound 
Powder of Crabs-eyes one 
Dram and an half; of the 
outward Bark of the Pomegranate, 
[^p.9^] 
of the Root of 
Spanish Angelica, of Red 
Coral prepar'd, of the Trochisc, 
de Terra Lemnia, each 
one Dram; of Bole-Armenick 
two Scruples, of 
Gum-Arabick half a Dram, 
with a sufficient quantity 
of Syrup of dried Roses: 
Make an Electuary. Take 
the quantity of a large 
Nutmeg in the Morning, 
at Five in the Afternoon, 
and at Bed-time; drinking 
upon it six Spoonfuls of the 
following Infusion. 
 
Take of the Roots Elecampane, 
Master-Wort, Angelica 
and Gentian, each 
half an Ounce; of the 
Leaves of Roman-Wormwood, 
of White Arch-Angel, 
and the lesser Centory, 
and Calamint, each one 
handful; of Juniper-berries 
one Ounce: Cut them 
small, and infuse them in 
five Pints of Canary: Let 
them stand in Infusion, and 
strain it only as you use it. 
 
Stinking Arrach, or Orrach, 
in Latin Atriplex Olida. 
'Tis easily known by 
its stinking Smell, which is 
exactly like Old Ling. It 
grows in Places where there 
is Rubbish, but it is not 
common. A Conserve 
of the Leaves, or Syrup 
made of the Juice, is good 
for Mother-fits, and Women's 
Obstructions, the 
quantity of a Nutmeg of 
the Conserve being taken 
Morning and Evening, or 
two Spoonfuls of the Syrup 
at the same Times. But 
the following Plaster must 
be applied to the Woman's 
Navel. 
 
Take of Galbanum, dissolv'd 
in Tincture of Castor, 
and strain'd, three Drams; 
of Tacamahaca two Drams: 
Mingle them, and make a 
Plaster, and spread it on 
Leather, having an Hole cut 
in the middle. 
 
The Woman must be also 
purg'd three or four times 
with the Pill Coch. Major, 
viz. Take of the Pill Coch. 
Major two Scruples, of Castor 
powder'd two Grains, 
of the Peruvian Balsam four 
Drops: Make four Pills, to 
be taken at Five in the 
Morning, and let her sleep 
after them. 
 
[^p.10^] 
After purging as above 
directed, let the Woman 
take of the Conserve or Syrup, 
as before mentioned, 
thirty Days, drinking presently 
after a Draught of 
Wormwood-Beer or Wine. 
Or, if she do not like the 
Conserve or Syrup, let her 
take the following Pills for 
the space of a Month. 
Take of the Filings of 
Steel eight Grains, of Extract 
of Wormwood a sufficient 
quantity: Make two 
Pills; let her take them in 
the Morning, and repeat 
them in the Evening; and 
so Morning and Evening, 
drinking a small Draught 
of Wormwood-Beer presently 
after. 
 
Common Arsmart, in 
Latin Persicaria. It has a 
single, small, woody, white 
Root, with many Fibres. 
It has many Stalks, a Foot 
or two Foot high, solid, 
round and smooth, branchy 
and jointed: When the Sun 
shines on them they are of a 
reddish Colour, otherwise 
of a yellow Green. The 
Leaves embrace the Stalks 
at the Joints, and are plac'd 
on short Foot-stalks: They 
are of a pale Green, not 
spotted, smooth: They are 
like Peach-leaves. The 
Flowers grow upon the upper 
Stalks and Branches, in 
spiky Heads, and are very 
small. Some of them are 
useless, no Seed succeeding 
them; these consist of four 
Leaves. Others are always 
shut, and contain a pretty 
large, three-square, shining 
Seed that is black when 'tis 
ripe; and these are red 
without. This Plant has an 
acrid and biting Taste: It 
grows in watry Places, and 
Ditches. 
 
'Tis plainly hot and dry: 
'Tis chiefly used outwardly 
in Wounds, hard Swellings, 
and old Sores. 
 
The Water of Arsmart 
is of great use in the Stone 
of the Kidnies or Bladder, 
a Draught of it being taken 
every Morning for two or 
three Months together. A 
Country-Gentleman us'd a 
Load of this Herb in a 
Year to make the Water, 
wherewith he cured many 
of the Stone. The Root 
or Seed put into an aching 
hollow Tooth, takes off 
[^p.11^] 
the Pain. There is scarce 
any thing more effectual to 
drive away Flies: For, 
whatever Wounds or Ulcers 
Cattel have, if they 
are anointed with the Juice 
of Arsmart, the Flies will 
not come near, tho it is the 
Heat of Summer. 
 
Artichoke, in Latin Cinara. 
The Germans and 
French eat the tender Stalks 
boyl'd, with Vinegar and 
Butter: And the Italians 
seldom boyl the Heads, but 
eat them raw, with Salt, 
Oyl and Pepper. They 
are said to provoke Venery, 
to restore Nature, and 
strengthen the Stomach. A 
Decoction of the Buds provokes 
Urine. 
 
Asarabacca, in Latin 
Asarum. It has many 
Heads shooting from the 
Roots, whereon are many 
smooth Leaves, every one 
upon a Foot-stalk by it self: 
They are rounder and bigger 
than the Leaves of Violets, 
and thicker; and of a 
darker green shining Colour 
on the upper side, and 
of a paler Green underneath. 
Among the Leaves 
near the Earth are six-angled 
purplish Husks, that 
are hairy, and plac'd on 
short Foot-stalks; these contain 
the Seeds, that are like 
the Stones of Grapes. They 
have within a white Marrow, 
that tastes somewhat 
acrid. 
 
It purges violently, upwards 
and downwards, 
Flegm and Choler. 'Tis 
Diuretick also, and forces 
the Courses: Wherefore 
Wenches use the Decoction 
of it too frequently, when 
they think they are with 
Child. 'Tis good in the 
Dropsie and Jaundice. 
 
Take of the Leaves of 
Asarabacca six, seven, eight, 
or nine; bruise them, and 
pour upon them three Ounces 
of White-wine; strain 
it. Take it in the Morning, 
or at Four in the 
Afternoon: Drink large 
Draughts of Posset-drink 
after every time it vomits. 
Or, 
 
Take of the Powder 
of the Root one 
Dram, or four Scruples; 
Oxymel of Squils one 
[^p.12^] 
Ounce and an half; mingle 
them, and take it in a 
draught of Posset-drink. Use 
Posset-drink in the Working 
of it, as above-directed. 
 
The Ash-tree, in Latin 
Fraxinus. The Seed of the 
Ash powder'd, and taken 
in Wine, forces Urine. The 
Juice of three or four 
Leaves taken every Morning, 
makes those lean that 
are fat. The Bark and the 
Wood dry and attenuate, 
and are supposed to soften 
the hardness of the Spleen 
by a Specifick Quality. 
The Juice of the Leaves 
and tender Twigs, taken 
in the Morning daily, in a 
small quantity, is said to 
do good in Dropsies. One 
Dram of the Seeds powder'd, 
and taken in Wine, 
is also beneficial in the 
Dropsie. The Salt of it 
provokes Sweat and Urine. 
 
Avens, in Latin Cariophillata. 
The Root grows 
oblique, sending down sometimes 
thick Fibres into the 
Earth. 'Tis of an Aromatick 
taste and Smell, like July-flowers. 
Several Stalks rise 
from the same Root, two 
Foot high, or higher, round, 
hairy, small, and full of 
Pith, garnish'd with Leaves 
plac'd alternately; they 
are branchy at the top. 
The Leaves that come 
from the Root are hairy 
and winged, small Wings 
being here and there joyned 
to the Middle-rib. The 
Extremity of the Leaf is 
cut in deep. The Leaves 
that are on the Stalks consist 
of two Wings that are 
pretty large, which adhere 
to the Stalk at the Basis of 
the Foot-stalk, as if they 
were Ears; and they have 
three Jags at the End, almost 
like a Bramble. The 
Flower does not come from 
the Bosom of the Leaf, but 
grows opposite to it, and 
has long Foot-stalks, and 
five yellow Leaves, like 
Tormentil. The Cup is 
composed of ten Leaves; 
five large, five small. Many 
yellow Threads stand 
round the Head, which 
grows into a roundish Bur, 
compos'd of a great many 
Seeds, placed thick together; 
each of them has a 
Tail that turns back at the 
End, whereby they stick 
to Clothes. It grows in 
[^p.13^] 
Hedges and Bushes, and 
flowers in May or June. 
 
'Tis somewhat astringent; 
it strengthens, and 
discusses; 'tis Cephalick 
and Cordial, and resists 
Poisons. 'Tis chiefly used 
inwardly to cure Catarrhs, 
and for quickening the 
Blood when it is coagulated. 
Wine wherein the 
Root has been infus'd has 
a fine pleasant Taste and 
Smell: It chears the Heart, 
and opens Obstructions. 
The Root infus'd in Beer 
is excellent for strengthening 
the Joints and Bowels. 
Two Ounces of the Root, 
or an Handful of the Herb, 
boyl'd in a Quart of Water 
or Posset-drink, to the Consumption 
of a fourth Part, 
has been us'd successfully 
in curing Agues, especially 
Tertians, being taken two 
Hours before the Fit, or in 
the Fit. 
 
[}B.}] 
 
BArbery-tree, in Latin 
Berberis. The Berries 
cool, and are astringent; they 
provoke Appetite, and 
strengthen the Stomach; 
and therefore the Conserve 
of them is frequently used 
in Fevers, a Loosness, and 
the Bloody Flux. The inward 
Bark of the Branches 
and Root, infus'd in Whitewine, 
is an excellent Remedy 
for the Jaundice. 
The Juice of the Berries, a 
Decoction of the Bark, or 
the Juice of the Leaves, 
mix'd with Vinegar, cure 
the Pain of the Teeth occasioned 
by Fluxion. The 
Conserve of it frequently 
taken, cures Inflammations 
of the Mouth and Throat; 
or the Mouth being gargled 
with some of the Conserve, 
dissolv'd in Water 
and Vinegar. 
 
Barley, in Latin Hordeum. 
The French-Barley is 
much used in Fevers, and 
for Diseases of the Breast, 
and for Heat of Urine. A 
Pultis of Barley-meal and 
Butter is very Anodine, and 
eases painful Tumours. 
 
[}Barley-water.}] 
 
Boyl two Ounces of 
French-Barley in Fountain-water, 
[^p.14^] 
change the Water 
twice; boyl it the third 
time in a Quart of Water, to 
a Pint and an half; adding 
Liquorish half an Ounce, 
Violet-leaves and Strawberry-leaves, 
each one handful; 
sweeten it with Sugar, 
or Syrup of Violets. 
 
[}The Cinnamon-water 
with Barley.}] 
 
Infuse twelve Ounces of 
Cinnamon in four Quarts 
of Barley-water prepared 
by it self, without the Liquorish 
and other Ingredients; 
distill them in B. M. 
 
Garden-Basil, in Latin 
Ocymum.'Tis about nine 
Inches high, and has many 
four-square Branches that 
are somewhat red, and a 
little hairy, The Leaves 
are like Pellitory-Leaves, 
they are smooth; some are 
indented, some not: They 
have a fragrant Smell, but 
do not taste very well. 
The Flowers are white, or 
of a purplish Colour; they 
smell sweet, and are plac'd 
on long Spikes, in Whirls. 
The Seed is small, and 
black. The Root is woody, 
black and fibrous. It grows 
only in Gardens. 
 
It comforts the Heart, 
and expels Melancholy: It 
cleanses the Lungs, and 
moves the Courses. 'Tis 
an Ingredient of three Compound-Waters 
in the London-Dispensatory, 
viz. Gilberts-water, 
Briony-water, 
and the Celestial-water. 
 
Wild-Basil, in Latin Acinos. 
It has but one thin 
Root, with but a few Fibres. 
The Stalks are one 
Hand high, hairy, red, 
four-square, branchy, tho' 
near the Earth they seem 
round. There are two 
Leaves at each Joint, and 
their Foot-stalks are contrary 
one to another; they 
are like wild Thyme, but 
larger; they are indented 
about the Edges, are green 
above, underneath whitish: 
Their Nerves are conspicuous, 
they are plac'd upon 
short Foot-stalks. The 
Flowers are dispos'd like a 
Whirl at the top of the 
Stalks and Branches, and 
shew themselves of a purple 
Colour. The Cup is 
[^p.15^] 
oblong, channell'd, big-bellied, 
but narrow at the 
Neck. It grows of its own 
accord upon chalky Hills, 
and on dry and gravelly 
Ground. It flowers in June. 
 
The Virtue of it is not 
certainly known; and, indeed, 
one would judge by 
the Smell and Taste, that 
it had no great Virtue, tho' 
Schwenckfeld says that 'tis 
hot and dry, and that it 
forces the Courses, and the 
Birth, and removes Melancholy. 
 
Baulm, in Latin Melissa. 
'Tis reckon'd among 
the Cordial-Herbs. It removes 
Melancholy, and 
cheers the Heart. 'Tis 
much commended for 
Fainting and Beating of the 
Heart, and for the Palsie 
and Falling-sickness, and 
for other cold Diseases of 
the Brain. Put the green 
Leaves into Canary-wine, 
and drink a Glass or two 
at Meals, it provokes the 
Courses, and Child-bed-Purgations; 
and is good 
for Mother-fits, and cures a 
Stinking Breath. For Madness, 
Take one Handful of 
the Leaves, cut them small, 
and infuse them in four 
Ounces of Brandy; add of 
prepar'd Pearl half a Dram; 
the Dose is two Spoonfuls 
Morning and Evening. 
This was counted a great 
Secret at Montpelier. For 
Melancholy, Take of the 
Conserve of Balm one 
Ounce, of the Conserve of 
Bugloss and Borage-flowers, 
each half an Ounce; of 
Confection of Alkermes one 
Dram; make an Electuary 
with the Syrup of the five 
opening Roots: Take the 
quantity of a Nutmeg 
Morning and Evening for 
the space of a Month, being 
first purg'd once or 
twice. A Maid was cur'd 
of deep Melancholy, and 
the Green-sickness, by the 
use of this Medicine. 'Tis 
us'd in Baths to comfort 
the Joints and Sinews; and 
for Diseases of the Womb. 
It flowers in June, July and 
August. 
 
Bay-tree, in Latin 
Laurus. A Decoction of 
the Bark, Berries and 
Leaves makes a good Bath 
for the Diseases of the 
Womb and Bladder. The 
[^p.16^] 
Berries are very effectual 
against all Poison of venomous 
Creatures, and the 
stinging of Wasps and Bees, 
and also in the Plague, and 
infectious Diseases; and 
therefore are an Ingredient 
in the London-Treacle. 
They procure the Courses; 
and 'tis said that seven of 
the Berries taken inwardly, 
will hasten Delivery, and 
expel the After-Birth. Being 
made into an Electuary 
with Hony, they cure 
old Coughs, and Shortness 
of Breath, and stop Rheums; 
they expel Wind, and provoke 
Urine, and comfort 
the Stomach. The Oyl 
which is made of the Berries 
is very useful in cold 
Diseases of the Joints and 
Nerves. The Electuary of 
it is frequently used in Clysters, 
to expel Wind, and 
to ease the Pain of the 
Cholick. So do the Berries 
themselves. 
 
[}A Clyster for the Cholick.}] 
 
Take of the Leaves of 
Mercury, Marsh-mallows, 
Pellitory of the Wall, each 
one Handful; of the Flowers 
of Camomil one Dram; 
of the Seed of Caraways, 
Cumin, of Bay-berries powder'd, 
each one Ounce; 
boyl them in clear Posset-drink, 
to three quarters of 
a Pint of the Liquor strained: 
Add three Ounces of 
Mercurial Honey, (which 
see among the Vertues of 
Mercury) of Hiera Picra 
two Drams. Make a Clyster. 
 
Beans, in Latin Faba. 
They are the chief Diet all 
the Summer-time in some 
Places, and are certainly 
very nourishing. A poor 
Country-man, when Corn 
was dear, dieted his Children 
only with Beans dried; 
and they were better colour'd, 
and fatter, than other 
Children. 
 
The Distill'd Water of 
the Flowers provokes Urine; 
and is much used for 
beautifying the Face, and 
taking Spots from thence. 
For the Gravel, make a 
Lee of the Ashes, strain it, 
and sweeten it with Sugar: 
Take six Ounces, with 
twenty Drops of Tincture 
[^p.17^] 
of Cinnamon in it. One 
that voided Blood by Stool 
three or four Months, was 
cured by eating Red Beans 
boyl'd in Milk, Morning 
and Evening, when other 
Medicines would do no 
good. They provoke Venery; 
but they are windy, 
and occasion troublesom 
Dreams. 
 
Bears-foot, in Latin 
Helleboraster.It grows only 
in Gardens. The Powder 
of the Leaves kills 
Worms in Children: But 
it is a churlish Medicine. 
 
Beech-tree, in Latin 
Fagus. The Leaves of the 
Beech-tree bruis'd, and applied 
to hot Swellings, discusses 
them. The Water 
contained in old and hollow 
Oaks and Beech-trees, 
cures the Itch in Men, 
and Cattel when they are 
mangy. 
 
White-Beet, in Latin 
Beta alba. It has a woody 
Root, of the thickness of 
the Little Finger, pretty 
long, and white. The 
Leaves are of a light green 
Colour, thick, and succulent; 
of a nitrous Taste. 
The Stalk is four Foot high, 
or higher, small, and channell'd; 
and has many 
Wings, wherein are the 
little Flowers, in a long 
Series, consisting of yellow 
Tufts. The Seed is round, 
rough and brown. 
 
Sea-Beet, in Latin 
Beta Maris. 'Tis like the 
White-Beet, but the Leaves 
are smaller and greener. 
They are plain and equal; 
and have sometimes red 
Veins, and sometimes not. 
The Stalk is also less. 'Tis 
common in salt Marshes, 
and on the Sea-shore. 
 
Beet is hot and dry, and 
loosens the Belly by reason 
of its Nitrosity. 'Tis an 
Errhine, especially the 
Root; for the Juice of it, 
received into the Nostrils, 
occasions Neezing. The 
young Plants, with their 
Roots, gently boyled, and 
eaten with Vinegar, procure 
an Appetite, extinguish 
Thirst, and suppress 
Choler in the Stomach. 
Beet, amongst the Ancients, 
was much taken notice of 
for its insipid Taste, Martial 
[^p.18^] 
reproaches it in the following 
Distick. 
 
Ut sapiant fatuæ fabrorum 
prandia Betæ, 
O quam sæpe petet vina piperque 
coquus? 
 
The Juice of this Herb, 
drawn up into the Nostrils, 
powerfully evacuates Phlegmatick 
Humours from the 
Brain, and cures inveterate 
Head-aches. This is 
counted a great Secret by 
some. 
 
Wood-Betony, in Latin 
Betonica. It grows in 
Bushes and Woods. The 
Flower is commonly purple, 
sometimes white. 
 
Many Vertues are attributed 
to this Plant, taken 
any way. Scroder describes 
the Vertues, in short, thus. 
'Tis hot and dry, acrid 
and bitter. It discusses, attenuates, 
opens and cleanses. 
'Tis Cephalick, Epatick, 
Splenetick, Thoracick, Uterine, 
Vulnerary, and Diuretick. 
'Tis used frequently, 
inwardly and outwardly, 
especially in Diseases of 
the Head. 'Tis observed, 
that the Faculties of the 
Root are quite different 
from the Vertues of the 
Leaves and Flowers; for, 
'tis very nauseous in the 
Mouth and Stomach, and 
occasions Nauseousness, 
Belching and Vomiting: 
The Leaves, on the contrary, 
are Aromatick, and 
of a pleasant Taste, and 
agreeable to Nature in 
Food and Physick. Counterfeit 
Tea, made of Sage, 
Betony and Ground-pine, 
sweetned, and drank hot, 
is very good for the Gout, 
Head-ach, and Diseases of 
the Nerves; and eases 
Pain, occasioned by these 
Diseases. 
 
Common-Bilberries, in 
Latin Vaccinia nigra vulgaris. 
This small Bush has 
many green, angled Sprigs, 
a Foot, or two Foot high, 
which are hard to break. 
They are divided into many 
Branches, whereon there 
are many tender, green 
Leaves; about an Inch 
long, and half an Inch 
broad. They are sharp-pointed, 
smooth, and curiously 
indented about the 
Edges, They taste partly 
[^p.19^] 
acid, and partly harsh. The 
Flowers are placed, each 
on a Foot-stalk, among the 
Leaves: They are of a 
pale-red Colour, with a 
Saffron-colour'd Thread in 
the middle; and, in form, 
are like a Water-Pitcher. 
To each Flower succeeds 
one Berry, like to a Juniper-berry; 
which is rather 
of a Violet-colour when it 
is ripe, than black. At first 
tasting of the Berries they 
seem pleasantly acid, but 
they leave somewhat that 
is nauseous upon the Palate. 
It flowers in May: 
The Fruit is ripe in August, 
and sometimes in 
July. 
 
The Berries are cooling, 
and astringent. They are 
very agreeable to an hot 
Stomach, and quench 
Thirst. They cure a 
Looseness, and the Bloody-Flux, 
occasioned by Choler: 
And are good in the 
Disease called Cholera morbus. 
They stop Vomiting, 
and take off Feverish 
Heats. A Syrup made of 
the Juice of the Berries, 
is most agreeable: viz. 
Take of the Juice strain'd, 
one Pint; Fine Sugar, one 
Pound and an half: Boyl 
it to a Syrup with a gentle 
Fire. Take one Spoonful 
at a time, or mix it with 
three Ounces of some proper 
Water. 
 
Birch-tree, in Latin, 
Betula. The Branches of 
this Tree are small and 
flexible, and most of them 
hang downwards. The 
Bark is very various; 
when the Tree is young 
'tis yellow, or brown; afterwards 
it grows lighter. 
It bears long Buds, like 
Long-Pepper. It grows frequently 
in cold and watery 
Places, and on moist 
Heaths. The slender Twigs 
of it were formerly used 
for the Magistrates Verge: 
Now they serve to discipline 
Boys, and to tame 
wild Horses, and to make 
Brooms, and to catch Birds 
with Bird-Lime, and Bands 
for Fagots. Fishermen in 
Northumberland fish a-nights 
by the Light of this Bark: 
They put it into a cleft 
Stick, which serves for a 
Candle-stick and so they 
see how to use their Three-teeth'd 
Spear for killing 
[^p.20^] 
Fish. In Alsatia the best 
Hoops are made of Birch. 
 
The Leaves are hot and 
dry, cleansing, resolving, 
opening, and bitter: For 
which Reason they are of 
no small use in a Dropsie, 
and the Itch, and the 
like. The Bark is Bituminous, 
and is therefore 
mix'd with Perfumes that 
are to correct the Air. 
The Fungus of it has an 
astringent Quality; upon 
which Account it stops 
Blood miraculously. 
 
This Tree, in the Beginning 
of Spring, before the 
Leaves come forth, being 
pierced, yields plentifully 
a sweet and potulent Juice, 
which Shepherds, when 
they are thirsty, often 
drink in the Woods. Tragus, 
Helmont, Charleton, 
and others, commend the 
Virtue and Efficacy of this 
Liquor, and not undeservedly 
for the Stone in the 
Kidnies and Bladder, for 
Bloody Urine and the 
Strangury. This Tree begins 
to yield its Juice about 
the Middle of February, 
and sometimes not till the 
Beginning of March. Tragus 
also commends it for 
the Jaundice. Some wash 
their Faces with it, to take 
off Spots, and to beautifie. 
Dr. Needham cured Scorbutick 
Consumptions with it: 
He used to mix with it 
good Wine and Honey. 
Rennet infused in the Juice, 
preserves the Cheese from 
Worms, says Tragus. The 
Juice of Birch cures Warts, 
and Pimples in the Face, 
if it be washed with it in 
the Day time, Morning and 
Evening, and permitted to 
dry on. 
 
The Greater Bistort, or 
Snake-weed, in Latin Bistorta 
major. The Stalks 
are sometimes more than 
two Foot high, small, 
smooth, and jointed at the 
Top; whereon are Ears of 
Flowers of a Flesh-colour; 
and being unfolded, they 
consist of five small Leaves, 
with Tufts of the same Colour 
in the middle. The 
Seed is brown, or almost 
black, and triangular. The 
Leaves are smaller than 
those of sharp-pointed 
Dock; above of a dark-green 
Colour, below gray. 
[^p.21^] 
The Root represents a 
crooked Finger, is red, and 
very astringent. 'Tis common 
in the Meadows and 
Pastures about Sheffeild in 
Yorkshire, and in several 
other Places of that County. 
It grows also plentifully 
in some Meadows 
about Tamworth and Fasely 
in Warwickshire. 
 
It cools and dries. The 
Root of it is very astringent, 
harsh, alexipharmick, 
and Sudorifick. 'Tis chiefly 
used to take off Vomiting, 
and to prevent Abortion, 
and the like. The 
Powder of the Root, mixed 
with Conserve of Roses, 
does wonderfully stop 
Spitting of Blood, and the 
Bloody Flux, and other 
Fluxes. It stops the Courses 
when they are immoderate. 
The Powder sprinkled 
upon Wounds, stops the 
Blood. 
 
Take of the Roots of 
Bistort and Tormentil, each 
one Ounce; of the Leaves 
of Meadow-sweet, Burnet, 
Wood-Sorrel, each one 
handful; of Burnt Harts-horn 
two Drams; of Shavings 
of Harts-horn and 
Ivory, each two Drams: 
Boyl them in three Pints of 
Fountain-water, to two; 
add towards the End three 
Ounces of Red Roses; 
strain them. The Dose is 
six Spoonfuls often in a 
Day. 
 
Upright-Blite, in Latin 
Blitum erectius. It has a 
red and single Root, with 
some small Fibres. It roots 
deep in the Earth if the 
Place be agreeable to it; 
otherwise it is fibrous. The 
Stalk is nine Inches high, 
channell'd, smooth, solid; 
sending forth many Branches, 
near the Earth longer 
than the very Stalks. The 
Leaves are plac'd sometimes 
opposite to one another, 
but oftner alternately. 
Their Foot-stalks are 
an Inch long, smooth, and 
not so frequent as in other 
Blites. The Leaves resemble 
the Leaves of Wild-Marjoram, 
but they are 
somewhat bigger; from the 
Wings whereof, and from 
the Extremities of the 
Branches, come forth small 
purple Flowers, in Clusters. 
The Seed is small, and 
[^p.22^] 
black. It grows plentifully 
upon Dung-hills, in 
Hop-grounds, and upon 
fat Earth. 
 
It mollifies, cools, and 
tastes insipid. 
 
Blue-Bottles, in Latin 
Cyanus. The Root is 
woody, and fibrous. It 
has many Stalks a Foot 
and an half, or two Foot 
high; they have Angles, 
are hoary, and divided into 
Branches. The lowermost 
Leaves have sharp 
Jags, like Scabious, or Dandelion; 
the other are long, 
and as broad as a Blade of 
Grass; and have Nerves, 
that run along them: They 
are Sky-colour'd, or whitish. 
The Flowers come 
from little Heads that are 
compos'd of Scales; they 
consist of little jagged 
Horns, and are commonly 
of a Sky-colour, sometimes 
white, or of a light red, 
or purple. The Seed is 
contain'd in the little Head 
of the Flower. The whole 
Plant tastes dry, and somewhat 
nauseous, and has no 
good Smell. It grows commonly 
among Corn. 
 
The Flowers and the 
distill'd Water are useful 
for Inflammations of the 
Eyes, and for the Blearedness 
of them. The Juice 
of the Flowers distill'd, is 
good for putrid Ulcers. 
The Powder of it, taken 
inwardly, is very effectual 
in the Jaundice. The 
Flowers infus'd in Spirit 
of Wine, or in common 
Water, impart their Colour 
to the Liquor; and 
they also colour Sugar very 
curiously, as do the 
Flowers of Succory, and 
the like. 
 
Borrage, in Latin Borrago. 
'Tis very cordial; 
and the Flower is one of 
the four Cordial-Flowers. 
The distill'd Water, and 
the Conserve of the Flowers, 
comfort the Heart, relieve 
the Faint, chear the 
Melancholy, and purifie 
the Blood. This Herb is 
suppos'd to be Homer's Nepenthe; 
by the Juice whereof, 
mix'd with Wine, he 
was wont to expel Sorrow. 
The Water of it is good 
for Inflammations of the 
Eyes, and for all Fevers; 
as is also the Conserve of 
[^p.23^] 
the Flowers. The Conserve 
of the Flowers mix'd 
with Wine, is said to open 
Women's Obstructions. 
 
To chear the Heart, 
Take of the Conserve 
of Borrage-Flowers one 
Ounce, of the Confection 
of Alkermes two Drams; 
mix them: The Dose is 
the quantity of a Nutmeg 
two Hours after Meals, 
drinking a Glass of Canary 
presently after it. 
 
Box-tree, in Latin Buxus. 
This Tree is always 
green, and full of Branches. 
The Bark is white and 
rough. The Substance of 
it is very hard and yellow, 
and very heavy, and without 
Pith. It has many 
Leaves; they are smooth, 
more obtuse than the 
Leaves of the Myrtle, 
firm, and sometimes concave; 
and, which is worth 
Observation, they are double: 
They smell pretty 
well, but taste ill. A great 
many of these Trees grow 
on Box-hill, near Darking 
in Surrey. 
 
'Tis seldom used in Physick. 
The Oyl drawn from 
the Wood, is much commended 
for the Falling-Sickness, 
and Pains in the 
Teeth. 'Tis said, the Decoction 
of the Wood cures 
the French-Pox, as well as 
Guiacum. 'Tis chiefly used 
by Turners. 
 
For the Pain of the 
Teeth, drop two or three 
Drops of the Oyl upon a 
little Lint, and stop the 
hollow Tooth with it, and 
it will soon give Ease. 
 
Bramble, in Latin Rubus. 
The Ancients attributed 
many Virtues to almost 
every part of this 
Plant. The Leaves, the 
Buds, the Flowers, and the 
Fruit are astringent; but 
the Fruit, before it is ripe, 
is very astringent; wherefore 
it is good for Vomiting, 
and all Fluxes. 'Tis 
good for Sore Mouths; 
and is commended by some 
for the Scurvy, and not 
without Reason; for, in 
quality and figure, 'tis like 
the Cloud-Berry of the Alps, 
which is a Specifick for this 
Disease; and therefore we 
need not charge Children 
[^p.24^] 
so strictly not to eat them. 
They do, indeed, occasion 
Children's Heads to be 
scabby; but it is because 
they eat immoderately of 
them: And so any other 
Fruit would produce the 
same Effect. A pleasant 
and generous Wine may be 
made of the Juice of the 
Berries, press'd out, and 
fermented with a little Sugar. 
A Syrup made of the 
Juice, is very good for Heat 
of Urine. 
 
'Tis most commonly 
prescrib'd in Gargarisms to 
cure Sore Mouths: Take of 
Bramble-tops, of the Leaves 
of Columbine, Cyprus and 
Sage, each one Handful; 
boyl them in two Quarts 
of Water wherein Iron has 
been quench'd, till one is 
consum'd: Add, Allum, 
one Dram and an half; 
Hony of Roses, one Ounce: 
Make a Gargarism, wherewith 
wash the Mouth often 
in a Day. 
 
White-Briony, in Latin 
Brionia albæ. The Root 
is as thick as ones Arm, 
white and fungous, of a 
bitter and acrid Taste. It 
sends forth pliant Twigs, 
channell'd, and somewhat 
hairy; which spread themselves 
far and wide by the 
help of their Tendrels, and 
climb up every thing that 
is near. The Leaves are 
like Ivy-leaves, but larger; 
they are hairy, and green. 
The Flowers, joyn'd together, 
come out of the Wings 
of the Leaves, and are of a 
whitish Colour. It grows 
frequently in Hedges. 
 
It purges strongly Watery 
and Phlegmatick Humours. 
'Tis proper for the 
Diseases of the Spleen, Liver 
and Womb; for it opens 
the Obstructions of 
those Parts. It drains the 
Water of Hydropical People 
by Vomit and Stool. 
It provokes the Courses, 
helps Delivery, cures the 
Suffocation of the Womb, 
and the Asthma. 
 
Juglers and Fortune-tellers 
make wonderful Monsters 
of this Root, which, 
when they have hid in the 
Sand for some Days, they 
dig up for Mandrakes; 
and by this Imposture these 
Knaves impose on our 
[^p.25^] 
Common People. Conserve 
of White Briony-Roots, 
taken twice a Day, 
to the quantity of a Nutmeg, 
for a long time, cures 
the Falling-Sickness, and 
Mother-Fits. A piece of 
the Root put into the Pot 
the Sick drinks out of, does 
the same. The Compound-water 
of Briony is most in 
use. I have used this Composition 
that follows, with 
excellent Success, in Women's 
Obstructions; and 
it is, undoubtedly much 
better in Hysterick Diseases, 
than the common Compound-water 
of the London-Dispensatory. 
Take of 
dried Briony-Roots, beaten 
to a gross Powder, two 
Ounces; of the Leaves of 
Rue, and dried Mugwort, 
each half a pound; Savine 
dried, three quarters of an 
Handful; of Featherfew, 
Cat-mint and Penny-royal, 
dried, each half an Handful; 
of the fresh yellow Pill of 
one Orange; of Mirrh half 
an Ounce, of Castor two 
Drams, of the best Nants-Brandy 
one Quart: Put 
them into a Glass, and let 
them infuse six Days in 
warm Ashes; then strain 
the Liquor off, and keep it 
in a Glass-bottle, well stopped. 
The Dose is half a 
Spoonful, to be taken in 
three Ounces of Penny-royal-water, 
sweetned with 
Sugar, Morning and Evening. 
 
The Lees of Briony, called 
in Latin Fœcula Brioniæ, 
are made after the following 
manner: Take what 
quantity of the Roots of 
Briony you please, slice 
them, and press out the 
Juice; this being kept in 
Vessels unmov'd, will in a 
few Hours depose the Lees, 
or Fœcula; which being separated 
by pouring the 
Water away gently, must 
be dried in a Glass-Vessel. 
They are used in a Dropsie. 
 
Common-Brook-Lime, 
in Latin Anagallis aquatica. 
It grows commonly in little 
Brooks. 
 
It heats and moistens 
moderately. 'Tis chiefly 
used in the Scurvy; it 
powerfully expels the Stone 
of the Kidnies and Bladder; 
it provokes the Courses, 
[^p.26^] 
and expels a dead 
Child. Outwardly applied, 
it cures Inflam'd Tumours, 
and St. Anthony's 
Fire. 'Tis much of the 
same virtue with Watercresses, 
only not so strong. 
 
Country-people cure 
Wounds with Brook-lime, 
mix'd with a little Salt, 
and a Spider's Web, and 
applied to the Wound, 
wrapp'd about with a double 
Cloth. 
 
Brook-lime boyld in Water, 
applied to blind Piles, 
has presently eas'd the Pain, 
when other Medicines 
would do no good. Fabricius 
says, he knew a large 
Ulcer that possess'd almost 
the whole Leg, and reached 
almost to the Bone, 
was cured in a Scorbutical 
Person only with Brook-lime 
boyl'd in Beer, and 
applied twice a Day. But 
it is most commonly used 
inwardly to cure the Scurvy: 
Take of the Juice of 
Brook-lime, Water-cresses 
and Scurvy-grass, each half 
a Pint; of the Juice of 
Oranges, four Ounces; 
fine Sugar, two Pounds; 
make a Syrup over a gentle 
Fire: Take one Spoonful 
in your Beer every time 
you drink. 
 
Broom, in Latin Genista. 
'Tis common in Sandy 
and barren Grounds. 
It flowers at the Latter End 
of April. 'Tis Splenetick, 
Nepthritick, and Hepatick. 
It expels the Stone, and 
purges Watery Humours 
upwards and downwards, 
by Stool and Urine: 
Wherefore it is of great 
use in Obstructions of the 
Liver, Spleen, and Mesentery: 
And in the Dropsie 
and Catarrhs, the Flowers, 
the Seeds, and Tops are in 
use. 
 
The Leaves, the Branches, 
and Tops, boyl'd in 
Wine or Water, or the 
Juice of them, are good in 
a Dropsie, and all Obstructions 
of the Kidnies 
and Bladder; for they 
partly purge watery and 
superflous Humours by 
Stool, and partly by Urine: 
One Dram of the 
Seed does the same. The 
Flowers, when they are 
green, are commonly pickled, 
[^p.27^] 
and make an agreeable 
Sauce; for they provoke 
Appetite, and force Urine. 
The Ashes are most in use, 
and frequently commended 
in the Dropsie: Take of 
the Ashes of Broom one 
Pound, infuse them cold in 
two Quarts of Rhenish-Wine, 
adding to it half 
an Handful of Common 
Wormwood: Take four 
Ounces of the clear Liquor 
in the Morning, at 
Four in the Afternoon, 
and in the Evening, every 
Day. 
 
Broom-rape, in Latin 
Orobanche. 'Tis two Foot 
high, or more; the Stalk 
is streight, round and hairy, 
pale or yellowish, or 
brownish; whereon are 
Leaves that are narrow 
and longish, if they may 
be called Leaves, for they 
seem rather the Beginning 
of Leaves: They soon fade, 
and Flowers succeed them, 
which are on a Spike, like 
the Flowers of Orchis, but 
at a greater distance; they 
are of a dull yellow Colour. 
The Root is round 
and scaly, and tastes very 
bitter. The Flowers smell 
pretty well. 
 
The Herb candied, or 
the Root, is of excellent 
use in Diseases of the 
Spleen, and for Melancholy. 
An Ointment made of 
it, with Lard, is good to 
discuss hard and Scirrhous 
Tumours. 
 
Butcher's-Broom, in Latin 
Ruscus, or Bruscus. 'Tis 
a Foot and an half high, 
and sometimes three or 
four Foot high: It has many 
tough Branches, and is 
full of Leaves, and they 
are like the Leaves of the 
Myrtle; they are ridged, 
nervous and prickly; they 
have no Foot-stalks; they 
are hard and strong, and 
taste bitter. At the Middle 
of the Leaf is plac'd a 
small Flower, on a very 
short Foot-stalk. When first 
it rises it represents a little 
Bunch of small Needles; 
but being open'd, three little, 
broadish Leaves appear. 
A round Fruit succeeds 
the Flower, that is 
larger than the Berries of 
Asparagus; 'tis reddish and 
sweetish. Under the Skin 
of it lie two great yellow 
Seeds, bunching out on one 
side, and plain on the other: 
[^p.28^] 
They are very hard. The 
Root is thick, oblique, and 
has many Fibres that are 
white and long, like the 
Fibres of Asparagus. 
 
The Root is one of the 
five opening Roots. 'Tis 
chiefly used for Obstructions 
of the Liver, the Urine, 
and the Courses. The 
Syrup of the five opening 
Roots is much in use, and 
is prepar'd in the following 
manner: Take of the 
Roots of Butcher's-Broom, 
Fennel, Asparagus, Parsly 
and Smallage, each two 
Ounces; Fountain-water 
three Quarts; digest them 
hot, then boyl them in B. 
M. to the Liquor pressed 
out hard, and clarified, 
add eight Ounces of Vinegar, 
and five Pounds and 
an half of fine Sugar; 
make a Syrup with a 
gentle Heat. The Dose 
is two Spoonfuls, in four 
Ounces of any proper distill'd 
Water. 
 
Buck-thorn, in Latin 
Rhamnus Catharticus. This 
small Tree is common in 
the Hedges in some places. 
The outward Bark 
is black; there are two 
within, one green, the other 
yellow: The Wood 
is pale, and hard. It has 
many Branches, that are 
plac'd most commonly opposite 
one to another; and 
it has hard, ridged and 
long Thorns plac'd among 
the Leaves, the Ends of the 
Branches being thorny also. 
The Leaves are like 
the Leaves of a Crab-tree, 
but smaller; they are 
pointed, of a dark Green, 
indented, and nervous, 
and have an astringent 
Taste. It has many small 
Flowers together, of a light 
green Colour; each consists 
of four Leaves. The 
Berries succeed the Flowers: 
Great Numbers of 
them are plac'd at the 
Roots of the Thorns, upon 
pretty long Foot-stalks: 
When they are ripe they 
are black, and full of 
green Juice. They have 
three or four triangular 
Grains, which have a 
blackish Bark, and a white 
Marrow that does not taste 
ill. The Taste of the Berries 
is bitter, and astringent; 
and the Juice has a 
certain peculiar Taste. 
[^p.29^] 
The Berry of this 
Shrub yields three sorts of 
Colours. Those that are 
gather'd in Harvest-time, 
and dried, and powder'd, 
and infus'd with Water 
and Allum, make a yellow, 
or rather a Saffron-colour; 
and is now in use for painting 
of Playing-Cards and 
Leather. Those that are 
gather'd in the Autumn, 
when they are ripe and 
black, being pounded, and 
kept in a Glass-Vessel, afford 
a delicate Green, 
which is called Sap-Green, 
and is much used by Painters. 
Those that remain on 
the Trees till the Feast of 
St. Martin make a red 
Colour. The Berries are 
purging, a Dram, or a 
Dram and an half of them 
being taken at a time. 
Some take fifteen or twenty 
of the Berries at a time: 
But they work so powerfully, 
that they are not to 
be given in Substance to 
weakly People. The Syrup 
is most in use: Take 
of the Juice of ripe and 
fresh Berries, gather'd in 
September, 2 Pounds, let it 
clear by standing; then 
add of Cinnamon and 
Nutmegs, each three 
Drams; infuse it in B. M. 
for the space of a Day; 
then press them out, and 
add a Pound and an half 
of White Sugar, and make 
a Syrup in B. M. 
 
Bugle, in Latin Bugula. 
The Stalk is foursquare, 
empty, and hairy; 
an Hand, or half a Foot 
high. The Leaves are indented, 
like the Leaves of 
the greater Water-Brooklime; 
two are plac'd by 
Intervals, opposite one to 
another; of a Violet-colour, 
or purple, or green: 
They taste at first sweet, 
afterwards bitter and astringent. 
The Flowers 
come out of the Wings of 
the Leaves, in a short hairy 
Cup, that is divided into 
five parts: They are of 
a Sky and changeable Colour, 
and of a sweetish 
Taste. The Root is small 
and fibrous, and tastes 
more astringent than the 
Leaves. 'Tis common in 
Woods, and moist Meadows; 
and flowers in May. 
 
The Virtues are much 
the same with those of 
[^p.30^] 
Self-heal. 'Tis Vulnerary, 
either taken inwardly, or 
outwardly applied. 'Tis 
us'd in the Jaundice, in Obstructions 
of the Liver, 
and for Stoppage of Urine. 
An Ointment made of the 
Leaves of Bugle, Scabious 
and Sanicle, bruis'd, and 
boyl'd in Lard till they 
are dry, and then press'd 
out, is of excellent use for 
all sorts of Ulcers and 
Bruises, and to heal 
Wounds. 'Tis one of the 
Ingredients for the Wound-Drink 
of the London-Dispensatory, 
commonly called 
The Traumatick Decoction. 
 
Bugloss, in Latin Buglossum. 
It has many Stalks 
coming from the same 
Root, about three or four 
Foot high, round and 
rough, with ridgid Hairs. 
'Tis branchy at the top, 
whereon the Leaves grow 
without Foot-stalks: They 
are many, narrow, oblong, 
of a Sky-colour'd Green, 
not wrinkl'd, like Burrage; 
they end in a sharp Point, 
and are hairy on both sides, 
and equal about the Edges 
from the Wings of the 
Leaves; and sometimes at 
their Sides, or lower, or a 
little higher, the Branches 
rise. The Flowers come 
on the top of the Stalks 
and Branches, from a Cup 
compos'd of five oblong, 
norrow, sharp, hairy pieces; 
the Flowers are less 
than those of Borrage, and 
consist of one Leaf, of a 
light purple Colour; an 
oblong Thread grows up 
from the bottom of the 
Cup, which is encompass'd 
with four Seeds that are of 
a russet Colour and wrinkled 
when they are ripe. 
The Root lives many 
Years, is black without, 
and white within. It flowers 
in June and July, and 
the Summer after. 
 
It has the same Virtues 
with Borrage. The Flowers 
are of great use in Melancholy 
and Hypochondriack 
Diseases, and are 
reckon'd among the four 
Cordial Flowers. A Person 
was cured of the Falling-Sickness 
by the constant 
Use of the Flowers 
in Wine for half a Year. 
Take of the Leaves of 
Bugloss, Borrage, Balm, 
[^p.31^] 
Fumitory, Water-cresses, 
and Brook-lime, each four 
Handfuls; of July-flowers, 
Marrigolds, Borrage-flowers 
and Cowslips, each 
three handfuls; the outward 
Barks of six Oranges, 
and of four Limons: All 
being cut and bruis'd, pour 
upon them four Quarts of 
Posset-drink made with 
Cyder; distill them in a 
cold Still, and mingle all 
the Water. Take three 
Ounces Night and Morning. 
 
Bur-dock, in Latin 
Bardana. It has a single, 
thick Root, that grows 
deep in the Earth; without 
black, within white. 
The Leaves are plac'd upon 
long Foot-stalks; they 
are very large, green above, 
and hairy under; 
they have a thick, short 
Down; they are not exactly 
round, but a little longish, 
and end in a sharp 
Point; they have short, 
small Prickles about the 
Edges, that are scarce visible. 
The Stalk is two 
Foot and an half high, or 
higher; thick, round and 
hairy, and of a purplish 
Colour, and full of Pith; 
the Leaves are plac'd on 
them alternately, at small 
distances; they branch out 
almost from the bottom. 
The Flowers are plac'd on 
the top of the Stalks and 
Branches, and come out of 
rough Heads, or Burrs, 
with crooked Prickles; 
they are purplish; the Burs 
are apt to stick to Clothes. 
The Seed is pretty large, 
oblong, and of a brown 
Colour. 
 
'Tis Drying, Pulmonick, 
Diuretick, Diaphoretick, 
Cleansing, and somewhat 
Astringent. 'Tis good in 
an Asthma, for the Stone, 
and Spitting of Blood; for 
old Sores, and Swellings 
of the Spleen, and of all 
other Parts in Gouty Diseases, 
wherein it is peculiarly 
proper. The Seed is 
an excellent Lithontripick, 
being powder'd, and taken 
in Small Beer or Posset-drink. 
The Leaves are 
applied outwardly, to old 
Sores, and to Burns. The 
Seed powder'd, and taken 
forty Days together, cures 
the Hip-Gout. 'Tis said, 
it provokes Venery. 
 
[^p.32^] 
Take of the Seeds of 
Bur-dock two Drams, 
of Wild-Carrot-Seeds one 
Dram, of Salt of Amber 
one Dram, of Oyl of Nutmegs 
half a Scruple, Balsamum 
Capivii a sufficient 
quantity; make small Pills, 
take four Morning and 
Evening. This is a good 
Diuretick Medicine. But 
the Root is chiefly us'd. 
 
Take of the Roots of 
Bur-dock three Ounces, of 
Sarsaparilla six Ounces, of 
the Wood of Guaiacum 
three Ounces, of the Bark 
of the same one Ounce, 
of the Roots of Notty 
China three Ounces, of 
Sassaphras one Ounce and 
an half, of Harts-horn and 
Ivory, rasp'd, each one 
Ounce; of Red and White 
Sanders, and of the sweet-smelling 
Flag, each six 
Drams; of Raisins of the 
Sun, ston'd, one Handful; 
of the Seeds of Anise 
and Fennel, each half 
an Ounce: Infuse them in 
eight Quarts of Fountain-water 
for twenty four 
Hours in B. M. and cover 
the Vessel close; then boyl 
it with a gentle Fire, till a 
third part of the Liquor is 
is consum'd; towards the 
latter end of Boyling, add 
of the Tops of Eye-bright, 
Betony, dried Sage, and of 
the Cordial-Flowers, each 
one Pugil; of Woody Cassia 
half an Ounce; of Nutmegs, 
number two; strain 
it for use. Take half a 
Pint four times a Day. 
 
Burnet, in Latin Pimpinella 
vulgaris, sive minor. 
It has a long, slender, 
brown Root, with some 
Fibres. The Stalks are a 
Foot, or two Foot high, 
angl'd, branchy, and of a 
light red Colour. At the 
top of the Branches are 
small Heads, from whence 
arise small purplish Flowers. 
The Seeds are short, 
and four-square. It has 
many long, wing'd Leaves, 
that lie on the Ground, 
which consist of several 
small, roundish Leaves, 
green above, and grayish 
underneath, finely indented 
about the edges, and set 
on each side of a Middle-rib. 
It grows commonly 
on chalky Ground, and in 
hilly Pastures. 
 
[^p.33^] 
'Tis Cordial, and Alexipharmick. 
The green Herb 
is put into Wine, to chear 
the Heart; and it renders 
it very pleasant, by imparting 
an Aromatick Smell 
and Taste to it. 'Tis a 
good Preservative against 
the Plague, and other contagious 
Diseases. 'Tis also 
astringent: Of excellent 
use in immoderate 
Fluxes of the Courses and 
Belly, and in all Hemorrhages, 
and to dry and 
heal Wounds and Ulcers, 
and the Biting of a Mad 
Dog. The following Water 
was much us'd in the 
last London-Plague: Take 
of the Tops of Burnet, 
Rosemary, Wormwood, 
Sun-Dew, Mugwort, Dragon's 
Scabious, Agrimony, 
Balm, Carduus, Betony, 
the Lesser Centory, one 
Handful each; of the 
Roots of Tormentil, Angelica, 
Peony, Zedoary, 
Liquorish and Elecampane, 
each half an Ounce; of 
the Leaves of Sage, Celandine 
and Rue, of the 
Leaves and Flowers of 
Marigolds, each one Handful; 
cut them, and infuse 
them three Days in four 
Quarts of the best Whitewine, 
then distil them 
carefully, and keep the 
Water for use. The Dose 
was four Spoonfuls. 
 
Butter-bur, or Pestilent-wort, 
in Latin Petasitis. 
First it sends forth a Stalk 
about nine Inches high, that 
is concave and downy, 
with narrow, sharp Leaves 
on it. At the top is a long, 
spiked Head of Flowers, of 
a purplish Colour. When 
the Flowers fade, and the 
Stalks die, large Leaves 
succeed, like the Leaves of 
Colts-foot, but twice or 
thrice as large, or larger; 
hook'd near the Foot-stalk; 
they are almost round, and 
indented about the Edges. 
The Root is thick and bitter, 
and creeps much. It 
grows in moist places, and 
near the Banks of Rivers 
the Spike and Flower flourish 
in April. 
 
'Tis much us'd in 
Pestilential Fevers. 'Tis 
also reckon'd good in 
Coughs, and for an Asthma. 
It expels the broad 
Worms of the Belly, and 
provokes Urine and the 
[^p.34^] 
Courses. 'Tis outwardly 
applied to Bubo's, and Malignant 
Ulcers. 'Tis us'd 
also to provoke Sweat, and 
to expel Malignity: Take 
of the Root of Bur-dock, 
Virginian Snake-weed and 
Contrayerva, each one 
Dram; of Cochinell and 
Saffron, each half a Dram; 
make a Powder. The 
Dose is half a Dram, to 
be taken in a proper Water. 
 
Butterwort, or Yorkshire-Sanicle, 
in Latin Pinguicula. 
The Root has 
some white Fibres, that 
are pretty large considering 
the smalness of the 
Plant. It does not grow 
deep. Six or seven of the 
Leaves lie on the Earth, 
and sometimes more; of a 
pale yellow Green; they 
look greasie, and shine as 
if they were besmear'd; in 
length two Inches, and in 
breadth about one; they 
are somewhat blunt at the 
Ends, the Edges are smooth, 
the upper part of the Leaf 
is cover'd with a very short 
Down, which is scarcely 
seen. Some Foot-stalks, 
about an Hand high, arise 
amongst the Leaves; at 
the top of each is plac'd 
one purplish Flower, of 
one Leaf, divided into five 
parts. It grows in marshy 
Places, and on moist Hills. 
 
The Leaves bruis'd and 
applied, cure fresh Wounds. 
Country-People cure Chaps 
in Cows Dugs, and Chaps 
and Swellings on their 
Hands, by anointing them 
with the fat Juice of this 
Herb. The Welsh make a 
Syrup of it, wherewith 
they purge themselves: 
They also boyl the Herb in 
Broth for the same purpose, 
for it purges Flegm very 
briskly: They also make 
an Ointment of it, which is 
of excellent use for Obstruction 
of the Liver. The 
Leaves beat, and applied 
to Parts affected with Pain, 
ease the Pain. 'Tis reckon'd 
Vulnerary, and very good 
for Ruptures in Children.
