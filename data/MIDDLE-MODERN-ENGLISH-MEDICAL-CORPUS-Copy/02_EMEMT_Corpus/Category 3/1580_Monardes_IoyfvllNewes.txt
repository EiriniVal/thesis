[^f.1r^] 
[}THE FIRST PART OF 
THIS BOKE TREATETH OF THE 
thinges that are brought from the Occidentall Indias, which 
serue for the vse of Medicine, and of the order that must 
be kept in taking the roote called Mechoacan, wherein 
are discouered great secretes of Nature, and great 
experiences: made and compiled by Doctor 
Monardus, Phisition of 
Seuill.}] 
 
IN the yere of our Lord God, 
a thousa~d, foure hundreth ninetie 
two, our Spaniards were 
gouerned by sir Christopher 
Colo~, being naturally born in 
the cou~trie of Genoua, to discouer 
the Occide~tal Indias, that 
are called at this day, the newe 
world, and they discouered the 
first land thereof, the xi. day of 
October, of the said yere: & from that time vnto this, they 
haue discouered many & sundry Islandes, and muche firme 
land, as wel in that cou~trie, which they cal the new Spaine, 
as in that which is called the Peru, where there are manie 
Prouinces, many Kingdomes, and many Cities, that haue 
contrary and diuers customes in them, in which there haue 
beene founde out, thinges that neuer in these partes, nor in 
any other partes of the worlde haue beene seene, nor vnto 
this day knowen: and other thinges which nowe are 
brought vnto vs in greate abundance, that is to say, Gold, 
Siluer, Pearles, Emeraldes, Turkeies, & other fine stones 
of great value. Yet great is the excesse and quantitie that 
hath come, and euery daie doeth come, and inespecially 
of Golde and Siluer, that it is a thing woorthy of admiration 
[^f.1v^] 
the great number of Melons, which haue come from 
thence, besides the great quantity of pearles which haue stored 
the whole world: also they doe bring from those partes, 
Popingaies, Griffons, Apes, Lions, Gerfaucons, & other 
kinds of Haukes, Tigers wool, Cotton wool, Graine to die 
coloures with al, Hides, Sugars, Coppar, Brasill, the wood 
Ebano Anill: and of all these, there is so great quantity, that 
there commeth euery yeere, one hundred ships laden therewith, 
that it is a great thing, and an incredible riches. 
 
And besides these great riches, our Occidentall Indias 
[/1./] 
doe send vnto vs many Trees, Plants, Hearbes, Rootes, 
Iuices, Gummes, Fruites, Licoures & Stones that are of 
great medicinall vertues, in the which there be founde, and 
haue been found in them, very great effectes that doe exceede 
much in value and price all the aforesayde thinges, by so 
muche as the corporall health is more excellent, and necessary 
then the temporall goodes: the which thinges all 
the world doth lacke, the want whereof is not a litle hurtefull, 
according to the greate profite which wee doe see, by 
the vse of them to follow, not onely in our Spayne, but also 
in all the world. 
 
And this is not too bee meruelled at, that it is so, for the 
[/2./] 
Philosopher doeth say, that all Countries doe not yeelde 
Plantes and Fruites alike: for one Region yeeldeth such 
Fruites, Trees, and Plantes as an other doeth not: wee 
doe see that in Creta onely groweth the Diptamo, and the 
Incence onely in the region of Saba, and the Almaciga 
onely in the Islande of Chio, and the Sinamom, Cloues, 
and Peper, and other spices onely in the Islands of the Maluca, 
and many other thinges you haue in diuers partes of 
the worlde, which were not knowne vntill our time, and 
the people of olde time did lacke them, but Time which is 
the discouerer of all thinges, hath discouered them vnto vs 
greatly to our profite, considering the greate neede that wee 
had of them. 
 
[^f.2r^] 
And as there are discouered new regions, newe kingdomes, 
[/3./] 
and newe Prouinces, by our Spaniardes, so they 
haue brought vnto vs newe Medicines, and newe Remedies, 
wherewith they doe cure many infirmities, which, if 
we did lacke them, woulde bee incurable, and without anye 
remedy: of which thinges although that some haue knowledge, 
yet they be not common too all people, for which 
cause I did pretend to treate, and to write, of all things that 
they bring from our Indias, apperteyning to the arte and 
vse of Medicine, and the remedie of the hurtes and diseases 
that wee doe suffer and endure, whereof no small profite 
doeth followe to those of our time, and also vntoo them that 
shall come after vs: in the bewraying whereof I shall be the 
first, that the rather the followers may adde herevnto, with 
this beginning, that which they shal more knowe, and by experience 
hereafter finde out. 
 
And as in this Citie of Seuill, which is the Porte and 
skale of all the Occidentall Indias, we doe knowe of them 
more, then in any other partes of all Spayne, for bicause 
that al things come first hither, where by better intelligence 
and greater experience it is learned: so doe I, with practice 
and vse of them this fourtie yeeres, that which I doe cure in 
this Citie, where I haue informed my selfe of them, that 
haue brought these thinges out of those partes with muche 
care, and I haue made experience thereof, with many and 
diuers persons, with all diligence and foresight possible, and 
with much happy successe. 
 
[}Of the Anime and Copall.}] 
 
THey do bring from the new Spaine 2. kinds of Rosine, 
[/4./] 
that be both much alike one to the other, the one 
is called Copall, and the other Anime. The Copall is a 
Rosine verie white, and of muche brightnesse, it is 
[^f.2v^] 
brought in certaine great peeces, which are like too peeces 
of Diacitron very cleare, it hath an indifferent smell, 
but not so good as the Anime: with this Copall, the Indians 
did make perfumes in their sacrifices, & so the vse thereof 
was frequented in the Temples, by their Priestes. 
 
And when the first Spaniardes went too those partes, 
[/5./] 
the Priestes went out to receiue them, with little firepots, 
burning in them this Copall, and geuing to them the smoke 
of it at their noses: wee doe vse heere to perfume with it in 
diseases rising vpon coldenesse of the head, in the place of 
Incence, or Anime: it is hotte in the seconde degree, and 
moyst in the first, it is resoluatiue, and softneth by some watrish 
partes, that it hath. 
 
The Anime is a gumme or Rosine of a greate Tree, 
[/6./] 
it is white, it draweth neere to the coulour of Incence, it is 
more oyly then the Copall is, it commeth in graines, as the 
Incence doeth, although somewhat greater, and beyng broken, 
it hath a yellowe collour, as Rosine hath: it is of a very 
acceptable and pleasaunt smell, and put vppon burning 
coales, it doth consume very quickely. 
 
It differeth from our Anime, that is brought from 
[/7./] 
Leuante, which is not so white, nor so bright, insomuche 
that some doe say, that it is spice of Charabe or Succino, 
which is called Amber congeled, wherwith they doe make 
[/8./] 
Beades, but it is not so, for that the Charabe is a kinde of 
Pitche, that is founde in the Germayne Sea, and it is taken 
out of the Sea in great peeces, with a dragge of Iron, 
so that it seemeth to come foorth of some Fountaines, into 
the Sea, after the maner of pitch, and beeing come foorthe 
vnto the colde ayre, it congeleth, for because there is seene in 
the same, peeces of stickes, & other superfluities of the Sea, 
cleauing vnto it, and in this they shall see the errour of them, 
that say that it is Gumme of Alamo; and of others, that it 
is of the Pinetree. 
 
[/9./] 
Of our Anime Hermolaus Barbarus, a man most excellenly 
[^f.3r^] 
learned doeth saie, that it is gathered about the place 
[/10./] 
where Incence is founde, and that lande or soile, is called 
Amintin and therefore the thing is called Anime. 
 
That which is brought from the newe Spaine, is gathered 
from certaine Trees, of a reasonable greatnesse, by 
way of incision, as the Incence, and Almasiga are gathered: 
we do vse thereof for many infirmities, and principally 
for the griefe of the head, and paines therof, caused of humours, 
[/11./] 
or of colde causes, and for sluffyng in the head, that 
thereof doeth proceede, after euacuation, perfuming therewith 
the chambers in the Winter season: and where as are 
generall infirmities, it doeth purifie and correct the Aire, 
and they doe perfume therewith their head kerchers, when 
that they doe goe to sleepe: for them that doe suffer paines 
in the head, and occasions thereof, it doeth profite to perfume 
the head of him that is so diseased, it doeth comforte 
the head vnto such as haue it debilited, or weakened, and 
doe suffer paines by occasion thereof: they doe put it also 
in plaisters, and in seere clothes, where as is neede of comfort, 
and to dissolue, especially cold humours, or windinesse: 
they doe vse it also in place of Incence, as well in the perfumes, 
as in the aforesaide. 
 
It doeth comfort the braine, applied in the forme of a 
[/12./] 
plaister, and euen so likewise the stomacke, and all partes 
being full of Sinewes, made after the fashion of a Sere 
cloth with the third parte of Waxe: it taketh out the cold of 
any member, whatsoeuer, being applied therevntoo for a 
long time, with refreshing it. It is hotte in the second degree, 
and moist in the first. 
 
[}Of the gumme called Tacamahaca.}] 
 
AND also they doe bring out of the newe Spaine 
[/13./] 
an other kinde of Gumme or Rosine, which the 
Indians doe call Tacamahaca, and the same 
name did our Spaniardes giue it, it is Rosine 
[^f.3v^] 
taken out by incision of a tree, being as great, as a Willow 
tree, and is of a verie sweete smell, it bringeth foorth a red 
fruite, as the seede of Pionia. 
 
This Rosine or Gumme, the Indians doe much vse in 
[/14./] 
their infirmities, chiefly in swellinges in any part of the bodie, 
wheresoeuer they bee ingendred, for that it dissolueth, 
ripeneth, and maruellously desolueth them. And euen so, it 
taketh awaie any manner of greefe, that is come of a colde 
cause: as humours, and windinesse: this the Indians doe vse 
very commonly, and familiarly. And for this effect the Spaniardes 
hath brought it. 
 
[/15./] 
The colour is as the colour of Galnano, and some doe 
say that it is the same, it hath white partes like to Amoniaco, 
it is of a good smel, and the tast is like, insomuch that being 
cast vpon hotte burning coles, and giuing the smoke 
thereof at the nose of a woman that doth swoone, or els hath 
last her feeling by suffocation of the Mother, it doeth cause 
her to come quickely, and easily to her selfe. And the Rosine 
[/16./] 
putte to her nauell, after the manner of a plaister, causeth 
the Mother to keepe in her place: and the vse thereof is so 
much amongest women, that the most parte which is spent 
thereof, is for this effect, for that they doe finde themselues 
very much eased by it, taking awaie from them all manner 
of chokinges of the Mother, and comforting the stomacke. 
Some that bee curious doe adde thereuntoo Amber and 
Muske, and so it is better then alone. It is alwaies fixed, 
without melting of it selfe, vntill that it bee al wholie wasted. 
 
And where it doeth most profite, is for to take awaie 
any manner of griefe, caused of colde humours and windie, 
[/17./] 
and beeing applied vnto them in manner of a plaister, it taketh 
them away, and dissolueth them with greate admiration: 
it doeth cleaue in such sorte, that vntill it hath done, 
and wrought his effect, it can not bee taken away, and the 
selfe same it doeth, being laide vppon swellinges, for that it 
[^f.4r^] 
consumeth and desolueth them, and if there bee any desire to 
ripen them, it doeth it, and that very quickly. 
 
It is also a remedie verified, and experimented, 
[/18./] 
that it doeth profite much in Reumes, and Runnings, 
wheresoeuer they goe, for it taketh them awaie, putting 
a small peece of linnen cloth with this Rosine, behinde 
both the eares, or the eare on the parte which runneth, 
for that it doeth restraine the running of them: and applied 
vnto the temples of the head, in manner of a plaister, 
it doeth withholde the runnings and the fluxe, that runneth 
[/19./] 
to the eyes, and to the partes of the face: it taketh away the 
tothe ache, although that the tothe bee hollowe, by putting 
a little of this Rosine into the hollowe, and if therewith the 
rotten tothe be burned, it maketh that the corruption goeth 
no further: and being laide after the maner of a plaister in 
the hollownesse of the necke, or griefe of the shoulders, it 
taketh away the paynes: mingled with the thirde parte of 
storax, and a little Amber made in a plaister, for the stomacke, 
[/20./] 
it doeth comfort it, and causeth appetite to meate, 
it helpeth digestion, and dissolueth windines: after the same 
sort put vpon the moulde of the head, it comforteth, and taketh 
away the paines thereof. In the Sciatica, or paynes 
[/21./] 
of the hippes put therevnto, the effect thereof is greate: 
and likewise it is so in all paynes of the ioyntes: and in any 
[/22./] 
payne of the body whersoeuer it be, chiefly if it come of cold 
humours, or mixt: For because with his resolution, it hath 
partes of binding, which doe giue a maruellous comforting 
in ioyntes, or in hurtes of Sinewes, putting that alone, 
[/23./] 
it doeth heale and cure them, for greate is the experience, 
that wee haue of it, ingenderyng foorth with matter: 
it taketh away an extreeme colde: ordinarily it is applyed 
[/24./] 
so all griefes: I doe mingle therewith the thirde parte of 
yellowe Waxe, for that will be applied the better, and the 
vse thereof is so celebrated, that the people knowe no other 
[/25./] 
remedy for any grief, but only the vse of this Rosine, so that 
[^f.4v^] 
it bee not inflamations very hotte, and also in them after 
[/26./] 
the first furie is past, and the fearcenesse thereof, it doth profite 
much for to dissolue the rest: it is hotte in the beginning 
of the third degree, and drie in the second. 
 
[}Of the Gumme Caranna.}] 
 
THey doe bring from the firme Lande, by the waie 
of Cartagena, and number de Dios, A Rosin of the 
[/27./] 
coulour of Tacamahaca, somewhat cleare, and 
thinne, called in the Indians language, Caranna, 
and this woorde and name our Spaniardes haue geuen it, 
and it hath in maner the smel of the Tacamahaca, although 
it bee somewhat more strong of smell, it is very oylie, and 
it cleaneth fast without melting, for the clamminesse that it 
hath. It is a newe Medicine, and brought hither about a 
tenne yeeres past, and the Indians doe vse it in their infirmities 
against swellinges, and in all manner of griefes, and 
now in our partes it is much esteemed, for the great effects 
that it doth worke. 
 
It doth profit and heale the same infirmities, that the Tacamahaca 
[/28./] 
doth, but it woorketh more speedily, so that many 
infirmities, wherein the Tacamahaca doth not so much effect, 
the Caranna doth easily heale. There was one that did 
suffer paines in his shoulders, the w=t= paines hee had suffered 
a long time, in such sort, that he could not stirre his Armes, & 
[/29./] 
hauing vsed a great time the Tacamahaca, yet hee was not 
healed, vntil hee had put thereunto the Caranna, and thereby 
in three daies he was made whole. In the griefes of the 
Iointes, and the Gout Arthetica, it hath a maruellous effect, 
[/30./] 
being applied vnto the grief, so that it be not an inflammation, 
of very hotte humour, for it taketh it awaie, with 
much easinesse. In old swellinges, as well in humours as 
[/31./] 
in windes, it dissolueth, in griefes caused by defluxe or running 
[^f.5r^] 
of cold humours or mixed, it worketh a meruellous effect: 
in all paines of the Sinowes, and griefes of the head, 
[/32./] 
and griefes that thereof do proceede, it profiteth much. 
Surely, it is a medicine to dissolue and to take away griefs 
of great efficacie, and doth make his worke with great certaintie 
in new greene wounds, especially of the Sinewes: 
it doeth much profit, and greatly in ioyntes, in the which I 
[/33./] 
haue seene done only therewith very great workes: it is an 
intercepting to staie the fluxe and running of the eyes, and 
other partes applied behinde the eares, and in the temples 
[/34./] 
of the head. It is very fattie and oylie, and hot more then in 
the second degree. 
 
And it is to be noted, that all these Rosines the Indians 
[/35./] 
doe gather by way of Incision, by geuing cuttes in the 
Trees, of which forthwith the licour doth droppe out, and 
from thence they gather it. 
 
[}Of the Oyle of the Figge tree of Hell.}] 
 
FRom Gelisco, a Prouince in the newe 
[/36./] 
Spaine, they bring an Oyle or Licour, 
that the Spaniards haue called, oyle of 
the Fig tree of Hell, for that it is taken 
from a tree that is no more nor lesse the~ 
our Fig tree of Hel, aswel in the Leafe, 
as in the Fruite: it is the same that wee 
doe commonlie call Chatapucia, or Cherua, it is also milkish 
as ours is, for that it is more burning in the Indias for 
the grosnes of the earth. 
 
The Indians doe make this oyle, as Dioscorides doeth 
[/37./] 
shewe, in the first booke, the xxx. Chapter, that is, do pounde 
the seede, & seeth it in water, and after it is sodden, then they 
gather the Oyle that swimmeth vppon it, with a Spoone, 
and this is the maner to make Oyle of fruite and Seedes, 
and Bowes of trees: It is verie much frequented and vsed 
of the Indians. As for expression or wringing out the iuice, 
[^f.5v^] 
they doe not knowe how to doe it, for lacke of knowledge, 
this kind of oyle principally is better drawen out this way, 
than by expression. This Oyle hath greate vertues, as by 
[/38./] 
the vse thereof hath beene seene, as well in the Indias, as 
in our partes, and all that I will say, is of very greate 
experience, and much vse thereof in many persons: it doeth 
heale and cure all infirmities caused of cold humours, and 
[/39./] 
windines, it doth dissolue al hardnes with mollification, and 
all inflammations being windie: it taketh away all manner 
of paine in what parte soeuer it bee, chiefly if it come of any 
[/40./] 
colde cause, or windines, for that in this, it maketh a meruellous 
woorke, dissoluing greate windinesse, wheresoeuer 
it bee, and especially in the belly: and with this they do 
heale a windy Dropsie, & lykewyse al kinds therof, annoynting 
[/41./] 
therewithal the Belly, and Stomacke, taking some 
droppes therof with wine, or other licour appropriated, that 
it may auoyde the citrine water, and make the winde to be 
expelled: and if they doe put it in any maner Glister, or Medicine, 
geuen so it doeth auoyde out the citrine water, and 
doth expell Windes with more assuraunce than any other 
[/42./] 
Medicine. In the griefes of the Stomacke of cold humors, 
and windes, and Colicke, it worketh great effect, anointing 
therewith, and taking some droppes thereof, and principally 
they do this in that mortall disease called the Ileon, which 
is a cetrayne filthines that purgeth at the mouth. It doeth 
[/43./] 
auoyde fleame principally, in griefes of the Iointes certain 
droppes of this oyle taken with the broth of some fat foule, 
it doeth empt away the humour that causeth the paine, it 
doeth heale the olde sores of the head, that doth yelde much 
[/44./] 
matter. 
 
A Gentleman that did vomit his meate the space of many 
[/45./] 
yeeres, did anoynt his stomack with this oyle, and therewith 
did recouer & neuer vomitted again: It doth vndoe Opilations 
[/46./] 
of the inner parts of the body, & of the stomacke, & 
of the Mother, anoynting it therewith. And vnto yong children 
[^f.6r^] 
and Boyes, that cannot goe to the Stoole, anoynting 
[/47./] 
the lower parte of the Nauill with this oyle, it doeth prouoke 
them to the stoole: and if they haue wormes, it doeth 
expell and kille them, chiefly if they giue them a droppe 
or twoo with milke or with some fat grosse thing. And for 
[/48./] 
those that haue lost their hearing, it causeth it to be restored 
to them, with a maruellous worke, as it hath beene seene by 
many experiences. In griefes of Iointes, and in griefes of 
swellinges, so that they come not of a very hotte cause, it taketh 
[/49./] 
them away and doeth dissolue them: any of the me~bers 
beeing drawen together, and annoynted with this Oyle, 
[/50./] 
they doe extende and the Sinowes are mollified with it, taking 
away the griefe if that there bee any: it taketh away 
any markes or signes, wheresoeuer they bee in the face, 
[/51./] 
principally, and the Morphewe which women many tymes 
bee troubled withall, the anoynting with this Oyle, doeth 
take it away, and consumeth it, not with litle conte~t to them 
that vse it. It is hotte in the first parte of the thirde degree, 
and moyst in the second. 
[/52./] 
 
[}Of the Bitume~ which is a kind of pitch.}] 
 
THere is in the Islande of Cuba, certaine 
[/53./] 
Fountaines at the Sea side, that do cast 
from them a kinde of blacke Pitch of a 
strong smell, which the Indians doe vse 
in their cold infirmities. Our people doe 
vse it there to pitche theyr Shippes 
withall, for it is well neere lyke vnto 
Tarre, and they doe mingle therewith Tallowe, to make 
it Pitch the better. I doe beleeue that this is Napta, which 
[/54./] 
the auncient wryters doe speake of. Possidonio sayeth, that 
there are twoo Fountaynes thereof in Babylon, one whyte 
and the other blacke. 
 
[/55./] 
That which is brought fro~ the Indias, we do vse against 
[^f.6v^] 
griefes of the Mother, for that it doeth reduce the Mother 
to her place. And if it rise on high, then put it to the Nosethrilles, 
and if it come downe to the lower partes, putting 
thereto a wet tent with this Pitche, it causeth it to go vpwarde, 
to her place: and likewise it doeth profite, being applied 
to cold Infirmities, as the other Medicines do which 
we haue spoken of. It is hotte in the second degree, & moist 
in the first. 
 
[}Of liquid Amber, & the Oyle therof.}] 
 
FRom the newe Spaine they doe bring a Rosine that 
we call Liquid Amber, and one like Oyle that wee call 
Oyle of Liquid Amber, that is to say, a thing that wee 
doe most set by, and as precious as Amber, or Oyle 
thereof, both of them being of sweete smell & of good sauour, 
and especially the Oyle of Liquid Amber, which is of sauour 
[/56./] 
more delicate and sweete than Amber. A Rosine taken 
out by incision from certaine trees very great and faire, and 
full of leaues, which are like to Iuie, and the Indians doe 
call them Ococol. They carrie a thicke rinde, of the colour 
of Ashes, this rinde being cut, doth cast out the Liquid Amber 
thicke, and so they doe gather it, and because the rinde 
hath a smell very sweete, they do breake and mingle it with 
the Rosine, and when it is burned, it hath a better smell, in 
so much, wheresoeuer the trees are, there is a most sweete 
smell through all the fields. 
 
When the Spaniardes came the first time, to that place 
[/57./] 
where it groweth, and did feele such a sweete smell, they 
thought that there had beene spices, and trees thereof. 
 
There is brought much quantitie of Liquid Amber into 
[/58./] 
Spaine, insomuch that they do bring many Pipes, and 
Barelles full thereof to sell for Merchaundise, for heere 
they raise profite thereof, to perfume in thinges of sweete 
[^f.7r^] 
smelles, wasting it in place of Storax, for that the smoke 
and smell doeth seeme to be the same: and also they doe put it 
into other confections of sweete smelles to burne, and suche 
like thinges. It casteth from it so muche smell without burning 
of it, that wheresoeuer it be, it cannot be hidden, but 
doth penetrate many houses and streetes with the sweete 
smell, when there is quantity of it. 
 
It serueth much in medicine, & doth therein greate effect, 
[/59./] 
for that it healeth, comforteth, dissolueth, and mittigateth 
payne applied vnto the Moulde of the heades by it selfe, or 
mingled with other thinges Aromaticall, it doth comfort 
the braines, and taketh away the paines of any manner of 
griefe, proceeding of a coulde cause layed after the manner 
of a Playster therevnto, it doeth also mitigate, and take away 
the paynes, & griefes of the stomake, wherein it doth 
a maruellous effect, applied after the maner of a Stomacher. 
[/60./] 
For that it doth comfort the Stomake, and doeth dissolue 
windes, and helpe digestion, and take away rawnesse 
it causeth the meate to be well digested, it geueth lust to eate: 
it is made of Liquide Amber, spreade abroade vpon a sheeps 
skinne, in the forme of a breastplate, mingled with a little 
Storax, Amber and Muske, it is a Playster which doeth 
profite muche in all that I haue sayed. There is knowne of 
this playster very great experience, in this Citie, for the 
good effect that it worketh: it is hot in the ende of the second 
degree, and moyst in the first. 
 
Out of this Liquid Amber, is taken the Oyle that is called 
[/61./] 
the oyle of Liquide Amber, the which in his smel is more 
sweet, it is taken out of the Liquide Amber when it is newly 
gathered, putting it in parte where it may distill of it selfe, 
(the more subtill) is the perfectest and best of all. 
 
Others there be that do presse it, because the more quantitie 
thereof may be taken out, & they bring it for merchaundise, 
for that they vse to dresse Gloues therwith for the common 
people, and in this trade there is much spent. 
 
[^f.7v^] 
It is vsed in Medicine for many diseases, and it is of 
[/62./] 
greate vertue to heale colde diseases, for it healeth excellently 
well al partes wheresoeuer it be applied, it dissolueth and 
mollifieth any maner of hardnes, taking away the paynes: 
it dissolueth the hardnesse of the Mother, and openeth the opilations 
thereof. It prouoketh the Monethly course in women, 
and it maketh soft any maner of hard thing. It is hotte 
wel neere in the third degree. 
 
And it is to be noted, that many doe bring this Storax 
[/63./] 
very thin from the Indias, which is not so good, for because 
that they make it of the bowes of the trees, cut in peeces, 
and sodden, and they gather the fatnes that swimmeth vpon: 
and the Indians doe sell the buddes of the trees whereout the 
Liquid Amber is taken, made in handfulles, & doe sell it in 
their market places, for to put amongst their clothes, which 
causeth them to smell, as of the water of Angels, & for this 
purpose the Spaniards doe vse it. 
 
[}Of the Balsamo.}] 
 
THey doe bring from the newe Spayne that licour 
most excellent, which for his excellencie and meruellous 
effectes, is called Balsamo, an imitation of the 
true Balsamo, that was in the land of Egypt, and for 
that it doeth such great workes, and remedie so many infirmities, 
there was geuen to it such a name. It is made of a 
tree greater than a Powngarnet Tree, it carrieth leaues 
like to Nettles: the Indians doe call it Xilo, and we doe call 
the same Balsamo. It is made two maner of waies, the one 
is by the way of incision, cutting the rynd of the Tree, which 
is thinne, geuing many small cuttinges, out of the which 
there commeth a clammish licour, of colour white, but it 
is little and moste excellent, and very perfect. The other fashion 
is, whereby the Indians doe vse too take out licour of 
[^f.8r^] 
the trees, which is a common vse amongst them is this: they 
take the bowes and the great peeces of the trees, and make 
them as small, as they can, and then cast them into a greate 
kettle, with a good quantity of water, & so boyle them vntill 
they see it sufficiently done, and afterwarde they let it coole, 
and gather vp the oyle that doeth swimme therevppon with 
certayne shelles, and that is the Balsamo that commeth too 
these partes, and that commonly is vsed: the colour therof is 
Alborne, which is likened to blacke, it is of most sweet smel, 
and very excellent. It is not conuenient, nor it ought to bee 
kept in any other vessel then in siluer, (Glasse or Tinne, or any 
other thing glassed, it doeth penitrate and doeth passe 
through:) the vse thereof is onely in thinges apperteining 
to Medicine, and it hath been vsed of long time, well neere 
since the new Spaine ws discouered, for that incontinent the 
Spaniardes had knowledge of it, because they did heale 
therewith the woundes that they did receiue of the Indians, 
being aduised of the vertue thereof by the same Indians, and 
they did see the saide Indians heale and cure themselues 
therewith. 
 
When it first came into Spayne, it was esteemed as 
[/64./] 
much as it was reason it shoulde be, for that they did see it 
make meruellous woorkes, one ownce was woorth tenne 
Duccates and vpwardes, and now it is better cheape: the 
first time that they carried it to Rome, it came to be woorth 
one ounce, one hundreth Duccats: & after that they brought 
so much and such great quantity, that it is nowe of small value: 
this commeth of the abundance of thinges. And when 
it was very deere all men tooke profite of the profite of it, 
and since it came to bee of so lowe a Price, it is not so 
[/65./] 
muche esteemed beeyng the selfe same Balsamo, that it 
was then when it was worth one hundreth Duccates 
the ounce. Surely if the Indias had not beene discouered, 
but onely for the effecte, to send vs this meruellous 
;[/66./] 
licour, the labour had been wel employed which our Spaniardes 
[^f.8v^] 
haue taken for that the Balsamo that was vsed to be 
had in Egypt, it is many yeeres since it failed, because the 
Vine from whence it came, dried vp, wherby you haue now 
none in the worlde. Our Lorde God did thinke it good in 
place of that to geue vs this Balsamo, of the newe Spayne, 
the which in my iudgement in Medicinal vertue, is no whit 
inferiour vnto that of Egypt, according to the great effects 
that we doe see in it, and the great profite that it doeth, which 
we doe see in Medicines, in three wayes: that is to say, it is 
[/67./] 
taken at the mouth, or it is applied outwardly, or it serueth 
in thinges of Surgery. Taken in the morning fasting, it 
healeth the shortnesse of breath: it taketh away the diseases 
of the bladder: it prouoketh the Menstrues of Women taken 
and applied with a Pessary: it taketh away the olde paynes 
of the stomake, licking certayne droppes thereof in the morning 
fasting, layde vpon the palme of the hande, and so continued: 
it doeth comforte the stomake: it doeth rectify the 
Liuer: it maketh a good colour in the face, it maketh a good 
breathing, it openeth the Breast, it vndoeth opilations, and 
conserueth youth. I know a person of much estimation that 
did vse it, and beeyng of great yeeres, did looke like a young 
[/68./] 
man, and liued after he vsed it without occasion of any euill. 
They which haue beene troubled with a dry cough haue vsed 
it, and to some it hath beene profitable, and some Gentlewomen 
that haue not brought foorth Children, haue vsed 
it in tentes for too purge the Mother, and it hath done 
them good. 
 
It hath beene also applyed outwardly in all manner of 
[/69./] 
griefes caused of coulde humours, or of windes. For that 
beyng continued, it taketh away very well and manner of 
griefe, applied hot, with a little fether, and laying there-vpon 
a cloth wet with the selfe same Balsamo, it is dissoluatiue, 
and so it doeth consume and vndoe swellinges colde 
and olde. It strengtheneth any part where it is put vnto, 
the foreparte of the heade it doeth comforte meruellously, 
[^f.9r^] 
and taketh away the paynes thereof, consuming any manner 
of humour or colde that is in it: it taketh away the palsey 
by annoynting the Foreheade and Necke, and the 
partes that bee impotent, and it doeth profite in all infirmities 
of Sinewes, and shrinkinges of them. Applied 
vnto the stomacke, it helpeth digestion, and comforteth it, 
dissoluing windinesse: and if there bee any opilation, it openeth 
it. And also the opilations of the inner partes it 
dieth mollifie and soften: it taketh away the payne of the 
Stone in the Kidneies or Raynes, beyng layde hot vppon 
the grieued place: in the paynes of the Bellie or Stomake 
caused of colde or wyndes, beeyng put therevnto hot, 
or layed vppon hotte. Breade taken out of the Ouen, it taketh 
them away, it prouoketh Vrine, and them that cannot 
pisse, applying it outwardly, and taking a fewe drops 
thereof, it doeth vnloose and expelleth it: in the paynes 
of the ioyntes it hath meruellous effect, and in these it hath 
a speciall Prerogatiue, and especially in the Sciatica, dissolueth 
any manner of hardenesse or swelling that remayneth 
in any such griefe: in paynes of the Sinowes it is a 
meruellous remedie, and in all runninges of fluxe, it doeth 
stoppe and heale. 
 
This Balsamo being applied in practice of Surgery hath 
great effectes, of it selfe, or mingled any other way with medicine, 
that hath vertue to doe the effect whersoeuer it is applied, 
and to shew all the vertues thereof, it would be verye 
long. I do remit it to him that shall vse it, that he may make 
the myxture that shall be necessary and conuenient. 
 
The balsamo is a verye common and vsed remedie for 
[/70./] 
woundes being newe, for that it doth cure them by the first 
intention, gleweing together the partes without making 
matter, and where there be bruses that cannot be glewed 
togither, it doeth a verye good worke, makyng digestion 
with readinesse, and in the rest of the workes that 
appertaine to Surgerie, it doth that which is conuenient 
[^f.9v^] 
vntill the woundes be whole, and for this cause the vse ther-of 
is a common medicine in all surgery for poore folkes, seeing 
that as with one medicine all effectes are wrought there-with, 
that are necessary: & it is a common thing to say, that 
when one is hurt, let Balsamo be put therevnto, and so they 
doe, & it doth heale them. In the woundes of Sinewes it 
woorketh a meruellous effect, for that it doeth both cure & 
heale. It healeth better then any other medicine doeth, it resisteth 
colde, the wounds of the head it healeth very well, not 
hauing the Skull broken, nor perished. 
 
Any manner of woundes beyng freshe it doeth heale in 
any parte of the bodie wheresoeuer they bee, so that there 
be no more in it but a simple wounde. In ioyntes what 
manner of wounde soeuer it bee, it doeth make a maruellous 
woorke: The vse thereof is very common in this Citie, 
in woundes. For that you haue fewe houses, but you 
haue Balsamo in them for this effect, so that in wounding of 
any person foorthwith they goe to the Balsamo, for with little 
quantitie thereof they doe cure and heale, and many 
times with putting of it once euery thirde day, they finde 
the wounde whole. In olde sores applied by it selfe, or with 
any other oyntment, it doeth mundifie, and fill them vppe 
with fleshe. 
 
In large feuers Paroxismales beyng layde halfe an houre 
before the colde doeth come, vppon the moulde of the heade 
very hot, the patient being very well couered with clothes, 
and taking forthwith fiue or sixe droppes thereof in wine, it 
taketh away the colde, in three or foure times doing it. It is 
of a sharpe sauour and somewhat bitter, wherby are seen the 
dry partes and comfortatiue that it hath: it is hot and dry in 
the second degree. 
 
I will not let to write of a certayne Hearbe, which the 
[/71./] 
Conquerours of the newe Spaine doe vse for the remedy of 
their wounds, and shottes of arrowes, which vnto them was 
a great remedie in their troubles, and it was discouered by 
[^f.10r^] 
an Indian, which was Seruaunt too a Spaniarde called 
Iohn Infant. He was the first that vsed it, they did call it, 
and doe call it at this present day, the Hearbe of Iohn Infant: 
this hearbe is little, they gather it greene, and beate 
it, and so they lay it simply vpon the wound: it doth restraine 
and stoppe the blood, and if it be a wounde in the fleshe, it 
doth cause it to growe together, and healeth it by glewing 
the partes. The woundes of the Sinewes, and other 
partes it doth comfort, mundifie, and ingendreth flesh in them 
vntill they be whole, and because they doe not find this hearb 
in all places, they bring it made into pouder, for that it 
worketh the same effect as well as being greene, and the 
pouder, as some say, doth it better than the hearbe. 
 
As this hearbe, so likewise haue you many other in all 
the other partes of the Indias, that haue the same and other 
properties & doe worke meruellous effects: and to write of 
euery one of them particularly, it were needefull to make a 
greater volume, then wee doe pretende of this that we shall 
entreate of. 
 
Three thinges they bring from our Occidentall Indias, 
which at this day bee celebrated in all the worlde, and 
with them they haue made & doe make the greatest workes 
that euer were made in medicine, & there were neuer the like 
made, by any other medicine that vnto this day hath beene 
knowen, for that the nature of al three is to cute infirmities 
which without this remedy be incurable, and to woorke the 
effectes that doe seeme to bee thinges of woonder, and these 
are notorious, not onely in these parts, but in all the worldes 
the which thinges are the wood that is called Guaiacan, the 
China and the Sarcaparillia. And for that it seemeth that 
the China doth come from Portingall, and that the Portingales 
doe bring it from their Orientall Indias, and not fro~ 
ours, I wil say what is to be said herafter when we do speak 
thereof. And therefore let vs beginne with Guaiacan, as of 
a remedie that first came from the Indias, and as first of the 
[^f.10v^] 
best of all, as experience hath shewed, and the vse thereof in 
so many yeares. 
 
[}Of the Guaiacan and of the 
holie Wood.}] 
 
THe Guaiacan, that is called the wood of 
[/72./] 
the Indias was discouered forthwith, whe~ 
the first Indias were fou~d, which was the 
Island of Sancto Domingo, where is great 
quantity thereof. There was an Indian 
that gaue knowledge thereof to his Maister, 
in this maner. Ther was a Spaniard 
that did suffer great paines of the Poxe, which he had taken 
by the company of an Indian woman, but his seruant being 
one of the Phisitions of that countrie, gaue vnto him the mater 
of Guaiaca~, wherewith not onely his grieuous paynes 
were taken away that he did suffer, but he was healed verie 
well of the euill: with the which many other Spaniardes, 
that were infected with the same euill were healed also, the 
which was communicated immediatly, with them that came 
from thence, hither to Seuill, and from thence it was diuulged 
throughout all Spaine, and from thence through all the 
world, for that the infection was sowen abroade throughout 
all partes thereof: and surely for this euill it is the best, & the 
most chiefe remedy of as many as hitherto haue been found, 
and with most assuraunce, and most certeintie, it healeth 
and cureth the sayde disease, if they be wel handled: and this 
water giuen as it ought to be, it is certaine that it healeth it 
most perfectly, without turning to fall againe, except the 
sicke man doe returne to tumble in the same bosome, where 
he tooke the first infection. 
 
Our Lord God would from whence the euill of the Poxe 
came, from thence shoulde come the remedy for them. Since 
it is knowne that they came into these parts from the Indias, 
[^f.11r^] 
and first of all from Sancto Domingo. The Poxe bee as 
common amongest the Indians, and as familiare, as the 
Measelles bee vnto vs, and well neere the most part of the 
Indians, both men and women haue them, without making 
thereof any scruple, and they came first in this sorte. 
 
In the yeere of our Lorde God 1493. in the warres 
that the Catholike King made in Naples, with King 
Charles of France, that was called Greathead, in this time 
sir Christofer Colon, returned from the discouerie that hee 
had made of the Indias, which was Sancto Domingo, and other 
Islands, & he brought with him from Sancto Domingo, 
a great numbers of Indians, both men and women, which 
he carried with him to Naples, where the Catholike king 
was at that tyme, who had then concluded the warres, for 
that there was peace betweene the twoo Kinges, and the 
hostes did communicate together, the one with the other. 
And Colon being come thither with his Indians, the most 
part of them brought with them the fruite of their countrie, 
which was the Poxe. And the Spaniardes began to haue 
conuersation with the Indian women, in such sorte, that the 
men and women of the Indias, did infect the Campe of the 
Spaniardes, Italians, and Almaines, for the Catholike 
king had then of all these Nations, and there were many 
that were infected with the euill. And after the hostes commoned 
together, the fire did kindle in the campe of the king 
of Fraunce, of which it folowed, that in short tyme the one 
and the other were infected with this euill seede: and from 
thence it hath spred abrode into all the worlde. 
 
At the beginning it had diuerse names: the Spaniards 
[/73./] 
did thinke that it had beene giuen them by the Frenchmen, 
and they called it the Frenche euil. The Frenchemen 
thought that in Naples, and by them of the Countrie, the 
euill had beene giuen them, and they called it the euil of Naples. 
And they of Almaine seing that by conuersation with 
the Spaniardes, they came by it, they called it the Spanishe 
[^f.11v^] 
Skabbe, and other called it the Measelles of the Indias, 
and that very truely, seing that from thence came the 
euill in the beginning. 
 
Amongest the great Phisitions of that tyme, there were 
[/74./] 
sundry great opinions of the cause, and originall of the infirmitie. 
The one sorte sayde that it came of the euil melancholie 
meates, that the hostes of necessitie had eaten, as 
wilde hearbes, and many gardeine hearbes, and rootes of 
hearbes, Asses, and Horses, and other lyke things, that 
ingender such lyke infirmities, corrupting and buruyng 
the blood. Others there were, that did attribute it to the 
coniunctions of Saturne and Mars, and they did apply it 
to the heauenly influence, and gaue thereuntoo diuers and 
sundry names. Some called it the Leprosie, others Swine 
Poxe, other Mentegra, others the Deathly euill, others 
Elephansia, without certaine assurance what disease it 
was. For they were ignoraunt that it was a new disease, 
and they would reduce it to some already knowen and written 
[/75./] 
of. And nowe we come to our Guaiacan, whose name 
was giuen by the Indians, and of them very well knowen, 
and so they haue called it and do call it, in all the world, calling 
it also the woodde of the Indias. Of this woodde many 
haue written and much, one sort sayeng that it was Ebano, 
others that it was kinde of Boxe, with many other 
names wherby they haue named it. It is a new tree and neuer 
seene in our partes, nor in any other of the discoueries, & 
as the country is newe, so is the tree a newe thing also. 
 
Whatsoeuer it be, it is a great tree, of the greatnesse of 
[/76./] 
an Oke: it casteth out many bowes, the rinde it doth cast 
from it being dry, greate, and full of Gumme, the hart 
thereof is very great, it is well neere lyke to blacke, all is 
very hard as much and more then Ebano is. It casteth forth 
a little leafe and hard and euery yeere it bringeth foorth yellow 
flowers, out of the which is ingendered a round fruite, 
with litle kernelles within it, of the greatnesse of a Medler: 
[^f.12r^] 
of these Trees there is greate aboundance in Sancto Domingo. 
 
And after this they haue founde an other Tree, of the 
kind of this Guaiacan, in Saint John de Puerto Rico, which 
is an other Ilande neere to that of Sancto Domingo, such an 
other tree as that is, sauing that it is lesse, & the body of the 
tree and the bowes are smaller, & it hath scarsely any harte, 
or if it haue any, it is very little, and that is in the body of the 
tree, for that the bowes haue none at all: It is of more sweete 
smel and more bitter then the Guaiacan, that is nowe vsed in 
our tyme, I meane that of Sancto Domingo, and for his maruellous 
effectes, they call it the holy Woode, & surely with 
reason: for that it is of a better working then that of Sancto 
Domingo, which is seene by experience, but euen aswell the 
one & the other is a maruellous remedy, to cure the disease 
of the Poxe: of the which and of euery one of them a water 
is made, and is taken for this infirmitie, and for many 
others in this forme. 
 
They take twelue ounces of the wood made small, and 
[/77./] 
twoo ounces of the Rinde of the same woodde broken, and 
they cast it to steepe in three Pottels of Water, in a newe 
pot, that will holde somwhat more, for the space of xxiiii. 
houres: and the pot being well stept, they seeth it ouer a soft 
fire of kindled Coales, vntill the twoo Pottels bee sodde away, 
and one remayning. And this is to be noted at the time 
the water is put to it, putting therein one Pottle, they dip 
in a little Rodde, and doe marke howe high the water of 
one Pottle reacheth, and by that measure and marke they 
shall see when the twoo are sodde away, and the one Pottell 
remayneth. After the water is sodden, they set it to coole, & 
straine it, and keepe it in a glassed vessell, and forthwith vppon 
the said sodden woodde, they poure foure Pottels of water, 
and seeth it till one bee sodden away, and this water 
must bee strayned and kept apart, and it must bee taken in 
this forme. 
 
[^f.12v^] 
After that the sicke man is purged by the counsell of a 
[/78./] 
Phisition, let him be put into a warme Chamber, and kept 
from the colde and from ayre, and beeing laied in his bedde, 
let him take early in the morning tenne ounces of Water, 
of that which was first made wel warmed, and let him bee 
couered so that he may sweate wel, & let him kepe his sweat 
at the least two houres, & after he hath swet, let him be made 
cleane from his sweat, & take a warme Shirt, and the rest of 
his Linen clothes, & foure houres after he hath swette, let 
him eate Reasings, Almonds and Bisket, and that in reasonable 
quantitie. Then let him drinke of the water that was 
made at the second tyme, the quantity that he hath need of, 
and of the selfe same let him drinke in the day time, & eight 
houres after hee hath eaten, let him returne to take the first 
water, and let him take other tenne ounces well warmed, 
and then sweate other twoo houres, and after his sweate let 
him bee made cleane, and then bee couered againe with 
warme cloathes, and one houre after hee hath swet, let him 
make his supper of the same Reasings, Almonds, and Bisket, 
and drinke of the second Water. This order he must obserue 
the first fiftiene daies, except hee haue some notable 
weaknesse, and in such case hee must bee succoured with geuing 
him to eate of a young Chicken, iointly, with the rest of 
the Diet: and in them that be leane, that cannot beare so precise 
Diet, it is sufficient that they take it for nine dayes, and 
at the end of them they may eate a little Chicken rosted, & if 
in case the sicke person be debilited, and that he cannot suffer 
the Diet, let him haue from the beginning a very small 
Chicken, going forwarde increasing in the proces of tyme, 
and beeing past the 15. dayes, let him returne to purge 
himselfe at the sixtiene dayes end, & let him take the waight 
of fiue shillinges of the substaunce of Canafistola, taken out 
by Strayner or other thing respondent thereunto, and 
that day let him drinke no strong Water, but of the simple, 
and the next day after the Purgation, let him returne to 
[^f.13r^] 
the aforesayde order, taking in the morning and euening 
the strong water with his sweatinges, and eating and drinking 
the same. Sauing that in place of a Chicken hee 
may eate halfe a rosted Pullet, or somwhat more, and 
this seconde tyme let him take it for other xx. daies, in the 
which tyme hee may ryse, and walke about his chamber, 
being apparelled and kept warme. And at the end of them, 
hee shall returne to purge him selfe an other tyme, and 
must haue a speciall care to keepe good order, and after hee 
hath take~ the water for other fortie dayes, must keepe himselfe 
from women and from wyne especially: and in place 
of wyne, hee must drinke the simple water of the woodde, 
which if he wil not doe, then let him drinke of water sodden 
with Anise seede or Fenell seede, supping little at night and 
eating no flesh. 
 
This is the best way that the water of the wood ought 
[/79./] 
to be taken, which doeth heale many infirmities incurable, 
where other Medicines could not worke the same effect, & 
this water is the best remedy that is in the worlde, to heale 
the disease of the Poxe, whatsoeuer or of what kinde soeuer 
it bee, for that it rooteth it out for euer without any 
more comming againe, and in this it hath his principal prerogatiue 
and excellencie. This water is also good for the 
Dropsy, for the shortnes of breath, for the Falling sicknes, 
for the diseases of the Bladder, and of the Raynes, for the 
paynes of the Ioynts, for all euils caused of cold humors, 
for ventositie, and other dangerous and importunate diseases, 
where the ordinary benefites of Phisitions haue not profited. 
Chiefly it excelleth where the euil dispositions be, that 
haue proceeded at any tyme from the disease of the Poxe. 
There be many that with this wood haue made sundry mixtures, 
making Syropes therof, and surely with good effect. 
But my iudgement and opinion is, that he which shall take 
the water of the wood, ought to take it in the maner as is aboue 
saide, without any mingling thereof, for that by expeperience 
[^f.13v^] 
it hath beene seene so to make the better woorke. 
This water is good for the teeth, making them white, and 
fastning them, by continual washing of them therewith: it is 
hot and dry in the second degree. 
 
[}Of the China.}] 
 
THe Second Medicine that commeth from our Indias, 
is a roote called the China. It seemeth that I 
should slaunder it, to say that the China groweth in 
our Occidental Indias, since commonly the Portingales 
doe bring it from the Orientall Indias. 
By this you shall vnderstande, that Syr Frauncis de 
Mendosa, a worthy Knight, when hee came from the newe 
Spayne and Peru, shewed to mee a greate Roote, and 
other little rootes, who asked mee, what rootes they were? 
I aunswered that they were rootes of the China, but that 
[/80./] 
they seemed to mee to bee very freshe. Hee sayde to mee, 
that so they were, and that it was not longe since that 
they had beene gathered and brought from the new Spaine. 
I maruelled that they had it there, for I did beleeue that in 
the China only it had growen: he said vnto mee, that not only 
there was in the newe Spaine the China, but that also wee 
shoulde see brought greate quantitie of Spicerie from the 
place which that China came from. And I beleued it when 
[/81./] 
I saw the contract that he made with his maiestie, to bring 
into Spaine great quantitie of spicerie, that hee had begon 
to set and to plante, and I saw greene Ginger brought from 
thence, as also the China. 
 
This China is a roote lyke to the roote of a cane with 
certaine knottes within it, whyte and some with the whytenesse 
hath an alborne colour: it is red without, the best is 
the freshest, that which hath no holes, if it bee weightie, 
and not worme eaten, and that it haue a fatnes as if it were 
congeled, and it hath an vnsauery tast. This Roote doeth 
[^f.14r^] 
growe in the China, which is the Orientall Indias neere 
to Siria and Sirciana. It groweth neere to the Sea, onely 
with the roote they helpe themselues, with the which the 
Indians bee healed of greuous diseases. And therfore they 
haue it in great estimation: they do heale al maner of large 
diseases therewith: and also the sharpe diseases: especially 
Agues, with the Water of it, prouoking Sweats, and 
by this way they heale many. It prouoketh sweat maruellously. 
 
It is wel neere xxx. yeeres since that the Portingales 
[/82./] 
brought it to these parts with great estimatio~, for to heale al 
manner of diseases, and especially the disease of the Poxe, in 
the which it hath wrought greate effectes, and the Water is 
giuen in this forme. 
 
The sicke person beeing purged as is most conuenient, 
[/83./] 
must take one of the Rootes and cut them small vnto the 
thicknesse and greatnes of a three penny peece, and so being 
cut, shall way one ounce, and cast it into a newe Pot, 
and thereupon shall poure three Pottels of Water, and 
so shall lye a steeping there xxiiii. houres, and the Pot beeing 
stopt, let it seeth at a soft fire of kindled Coales, vntill 
half be sodden away, & one Pottel & half remaine, and this 
is to be knowen by the order of the Measure as aforesaid, in 
the water of the Wood. And after that it is colde, let it bee 
strained and kept in a glassed vessel. There must be care taken, 
that it stande in some hotte or warme place neere to the 
fire, for that therwith it doeth preserue the vertue the better, 
and dureth longer tyme, before it be corrupted. 
 
The sicke man being lodged in a close conuenient Chamber, 
[/84./] 
must take in the morning fasting tenne ounces of the 
sayde water, as hotte as he can suffer it, and he shall procure 
sweat, & keepe it two houres at the least. After the sweat hee 
shal bee made cleane, and shall take a Shirte, and cleane 
clothes, & warme them, and shall lye downe againe twoo or 
three houres in the bed quietly, after hee hath swet. And 
[^f.14v^] 
afterwarde let him apparell himselfe, and beeing well 
warmed remayne in his Chamber, in the which he shal be 
kept from cold & the open ayre, with all the pleasure of good 
company and conuersation: he shal eate at xi. of the clocke, 
halfe a Chicken sodden, or a quarter of a Henne, with a 
little Salt. At the beginning of dinner he shal drinke a dishfull 
of Broth, and foorthwith eate of the Pullet, eating at 
the beginning a little, and hee shal ende with Marmelade. 
His drinke shal bee of the water hee tooke in the morning, 
for that heere is no more then one water, hee may at the beginning 
after the Broth is taken, begin too eate Reasinges, 
without theyr little Graynes, or Prunes without 
theyr stones: theyr bread must bee Crustie, well baked, or 
Bisket. If hee will drinke in the day tyme, hee may doe 
so with taking of a little Conserua, and drinke of the same 
water, and beeing eight houres past his Dinner, let 
him lye downe in his Bedde, and take other tenne ounces 
of the same water, the which being hotte hee may drinke, 
and procure sweate: two houres after he hath sweat, let him 
be made cleane, and take a cleane shirte, and cleane clothes 
warme, and after one houre let him sup with Co~serua, Reasinges 
and Almondes, with some Bisket, and drinke of the 
selfe same water, and last of all eate Marmelade, vpon the 
which he may not drinke. Thus he may continue xxx. dayes 
continually, without neede of any more Purgation then the 
first, and hee may sit vp, so that he go wel cloathed, vsing in 
this tyme all content and mirth, and keeping him selfe from 
al that may offend him. 
 
After that he hath taken this water in this sort, hee must 
[/85./] 
keepe good order, and good gouernement for fortie dayes 
continually. And hee must drinke no Wine, but water made 
of the China, that was before sodden, the which hee shall 
keepe after it is sodden, setting it to dry in a shadowie place, 
and that China being dry, must be kept to make water for other 
40. dayes, to drinke after the taking of the first water: 
[^f.15r^] 
seething one ounce thereof in three Pottels of water vntil 
one halfe be sodden away, and this water let him drinke continually. 
And aboue all thinges let him keepe himselfe 
from women: and he must alwayes haue care, that as well 
in the water of xxx. dayes, as in the water of the fourty daies, 
that the China be steeped in the water xxiiii. houres before it 
be sodden. 
 
[/86./] 
There be many diseases healed with this water, al kinds 
of euill of the Poxe, all olde Sores, it resolueth all swellinges 
and knobbes, it taketh away the paynes of the 
ioyntes which they call the Arthetica Goute, and any other 
kinde of Goute that is in any particular member or place, 
and especially the Sciatica, it taketh away olde paynes of 
the head and of the stomake. It healeth all manner of runninges 
of Rewmes, it dissolueth Opilations and healeth the 
Dropsie. It maketh a good colour in the face, it taketh awaie 
the Iaundies, and all euill complexion of the Liuer & 
rectifieth it, and in this it hath a greate prerogatiue. And by 
this meanes these infirmities are healed. It healeth the Palsey 
& all infirmities of the Sinewes, it healeth all diseases 
of Urine, it taketh away Melancholy, and all infirmities 
comming of colde diseases. It doth comfort the stomake, it 
doth dissolue windes meruellously, and also Agues long and 
sharp, as quotidians: the taking of this water as it is conuenient, 
so doth it roote them out, and take them away. The 
which thing it doeth by prouoking of sweat, in this it doth 
exceede all other Medicines, and some will say that in Pestilent 
Agues, by prouoking sweat it healeth them. It is dry 
[/87./] 
in the second degree with very litle heate, the which is seene 
by the other waters of the wood. And as Sarcaparillia which 
doth heate and drie, so this doth not, nor leaueth any impression 
of heate. 
 
Surely it is a notable Medicine, in the which I haue 
[/88./] 
founde greate effectes for the Diseases which I haue spoken 
of.
