the waight of Suger to y=e= waight 
of Uiolet flowres, but to all other 
flowres put .iii. partes of Suger to 
i. parte of the flowres. 
 
[}The vertue of the same.}] 
 
COnserue of Uiolet Flowres is 
good against the heate and influmation 
of Coler, called yellow 
Coler, it quencheth thirstities, 
it maketh y=e= Belly moyst & soluble.

y=e= burni~g & heat of hot feuers. 
 
[^f.C3r^] 
[}The vertue of the conserue 
of Elder flowres. Cap. xxiij.}] 
 
COnserue of the flowres of Elder 
is good agaynst the morphewe, 
it clenseth the stomack, and y=e= whol 
body from scabbs. Gather the clusters, 
or bunches whereon y=e= flowres 
grow when they are newe blowne 
and spreade: lay them vpon a fayre 
sheete abrode in a Chamber a daye 
or two tyll ye shal perceue y=e= flowre 
wyll shake off and fall awaye, then 
pyke them cleane, and make therof 
conserue, as ye do of other Flowres. 
 
And whereas it is more holsome 
then pleasant, therfore put some other 
conserue (suche as ye luste) amongst 
it, when ye wyl occupy it. 
 
[}The vertue of the conserue of

[}To make conserue of Elecampana 
Rootes. cap. xxvi.}] 
 
TAke the roots of Elecampane 
wash the~ clene, slice them in to 
peeces as big as your your thumbe, 
seeth them in faire water, tyll they 
[^f.C4r^] 
bee tender, take them vp, & powne

put therto in the second sethi~g 
the bodie or treble waight of sugre

[}To make conserue of Acorns or Gladon. 
With the vertue of the same.}] 
chapter. xxvii.}] 
 
TAke the roots of yellow flowre

grownde, otherwise called a 
Flag roote, washe them and scrape 
them, seeth them, and order them 
as ye doo of Elecampana now 
[^f.C4v^] 
last before rehearsed, and so kepe it. 
This conserue is good againste all 
sicknesse of the brain and synowes, 
and against all deseases of fleume, 
vnto women it oppeneth naturall 
course and termes. 
 
And you muste generally learne, 
that in makyng conserues, Frutes 
and Roots are made with fyre and 
seething: but Flowres are made w=t=out 
fyre or seething. Moreouer the 
more Suger or Honey is put into 
the~, so it be not past .iii. li. to .i. the 
conserue shal continew the better. 
 
[}To make Marmalade of 
Quinces. Cap. .xxviii.}] 
 
AFter that your Quinces ar sodden, 
ready to be kept condict as before 
in the chapter is written, then 
with some of the liquor wheri~ thei 
were sodden (but without anispice) 
[^f.C5r^] 
beate them and drawe them as ye 
wolde do a Tarte, then put some ouer 
the fyre to seethe softlye, and in 
the seething strew by little & little 
of pouder of suger, y=e= waight of the 
Quinces, or more, as your tast shall 
tel you, stir it continually, put ther 
to some pure rosewater, or damask 
water, let it seeth on height til it be 
wal standyng, which thing ye may 
know, by takyng some of it vpon a 
colde knife and let it keele, if it bee 
stiff, then take it off & boxe it while 
it is warme, and set it in a warme 
and dry ayre, yf you wyl gylde your 
Marmalade, do as afore is spoken 
of a Marchpane. 
 
The beste makyng of Marmalade 
is when the Quinces haue 
layne long & are through ripe, and 
very yellow, as in lent season. 
 
And forasmuche as Quinces 
[^f.C5v^] 
are bynding and therfore not good 
for some sickefolkes costife, it is 
necessary to put a good ma~y of ripe 
apples of good verdure, as Renet, 
Pyppen, Lording, Russetyng, Pomeriall, 
Rex pomorii, or any other 
apple that is pleasant raw among 
them, being fyrst drawne, for a tart 
and then sodden amonge the other 
matter of Quinces. Thus shall you 
make your Marmalade, somewhat 
souple, and also encrease the quantitie 
and verdure of the same, specially 
if it be well dashed with swete 
water. 
 
[}To make Marmalade of Damsins 
or Prunes. Cap. xxix.}] 
 
TAke Damsins which ar ripe, 
boyle them on the Fyre with 
a lyttle fayre water tyll they 
bee softe, then draw them through 
a course Boulter as ye make a tart 
set it on the fyre agayne seethe it 
[^f.C6r^] 
on height with sufficient suger, as 
you do your Quinces, dash it with 
sweete water. &c. and box it. 
If you wil make it of Prunes, euen 
likewise doo put some Apples also 
to it, as you dyd to your Quinces. 
 
This wise you may make Marmylade 
of Wardens, Peares, apples, & 
Medlars, Seruits or Checkers, 
strawberys euery one by him selfe, 
or els mixt it together, as you thi~k 
good. 
 
[}To make conserue of Strawberies, 
With the vertue of the same. 
chapter. xxx.}] 
 
TAke Strawberies .i. quart clene 
picked and washed, set them on 
the fyre til they be soft, strain them 
put thereto two times as much suger 
in powder, as waight of the 
strawberies, let them seeth tyll the 
suger be incorporated w=t= y=e= straberis 
[^f.C6v^] 
put it in a Glasse of earthen Pot 
well glased. 
 
[}The vertue of the same.}] 
 
The conserue of Strawberies 
is good against a hot liuer, or burning 
of the stomack, and specially 
in the seruent heate of an ague. 
Thus make conserue of Damasins 
and Prunes. 
 
[}To make conserue of Cheries 
and Barberies. Cap. xxxi.}] 
 
LYkewise ye must make co~serue 
of Cheries, and also of barberis 
sauing that these require more Suger 
then the other do which ar not 
so sowre as they bee. 
 
Here is to be noted, that of conserues 
of Fruits mai be made marmalade, 
for when your conserue is 
sufficiently sodden, and ready to be 
take~ off the~ seeth it more on height 
and it wyll be Marmalade. 
[^f.C7r^] 
Moreouer some make their conserue, 
Marmalade & Syrops with 
cleane Suger, some with cleane 
Hony clarifyed, some with Suger 
and Hony together. And after the 
opinion of diuers great Clarkes, 
Honye is more holsome, though it 
be not so toothsome as suger. 
 
[}To make Succade of Peels 
of Oranges and Lemons. 
Chapter. xxxii.}] 
 
Fyrste take offe your Peeles by 
quarters and seeth them in fair 
water from .iii. quartes to .iii. 
pynts, then take them out, and put 
to as much more water, and seethe 
them lykewyse and so doe agayne, 
till the water wherin they are sodden 
haue no bitternesse at all of the 
Peeles, then are they ready. Now 
prepare a Syrop as ye doe for quinces 
condict in syrop in y=e= .xiiii. 
[^f.C7v^] 
chapter before written: seeth them 
in the Syrope a while, a keep them 
in a Glasse or Pot. 
 
[}To make greene Gynger. 
chapter. xxxiii.}] 
 
TAke the Rases of cased Ginger 
of the fairest, and vse them as 
foloweth, lay a broad lane of faire 
sand vpon a low flore on y=e= grownd 
halfe a foote thicke, then laye your 
Rases of Ginger vpon the sande in 
order, couer the Ginger with more 
sand .iiii. or .v. fingers thick. sprinkel 
the sand ouer faite with water, 
twice euery day, that it be moyste, 
thus dayly do tyll ye shall perceaue 
your Rases to be soft. Then take 
vp your Rases: wash them & scrape 
them cleane, haue & Syrop readye 
made as aboue is sayde, seeth them 
in it till they be wel seasoned, take 
them vp and with some of y=e= Syrop 
cast the~, or put the~ in a pot of stone. 
 
[^f.C8r^] 
[}To make Pepper soft: With the 
vertue of the same.}] 
 
AFter the same manner with 
sand ye may make pepper soft 
and with lyke Syrop season & kepe 
them. Ginger & Pepper in syrop 
comforteth a colde stomake, & helpeth 
much to good disgestion. 
 
[}To make all kinde of Syrops. 
chapter. xxxiiii.}] 
 
TAke Buglosse, Borage, white 
Endiue, of each .i. handfull, of

let them seethe vpon a softe fyre 
well styrred for burnning too. 
[^f.C8v^] 
vntyll it come to the thicknesse of 
liue Hony, then keepe it in Gallypots, 
if you put .i. pynte Malmzey 
in the second seethi~g, it wyl be better. 
When it is perfecte, haue sixe 
graynes of fine Muske in powder, 
stirre it amongst your Syrop as ye 
put it in the Gallypot, and couer it 
 
This Syrop will last many yeres 
and is excellent against swowning 
and faintnesse of hert, it co~forteth 
the Brayne and Sinewes, if it bee 
vsed as muche as a Hasell Nut at 
once, at your pleasure.

MEdicines ar made diuers and 
sundry wayes, some by leues, 
some by sedes, some by rootes, some 
by Herbes, some by flowres, & some 
by fruits: Such leues as are put to 
medicins shuld be gatherd whe~ thei 
[^f.E7r^] 
be at at theyr full wexing, ere that 
their coullour be chaunged, or that 
they fade any thing. 
 
Sedes when they be ful ripe and 
the moystnes somwhat dried away 
Flowres shoulde be taken when 
they be fully open ere they begin 
to fade. 
 
Herbes should be gathered when 
they be full of Sappe, and ere they 
shrink. 
 
Rootes should be gathered when 
the leaues fall. 
 
Fruites shoulde be taken when 
that they be at their ful growth, or 
when they fal, & the heuier y~ fruite 
is, the better, & those that be great 
and light in ponderation chuse not 
them, and those that be gathered 
in fayr, wether be better then chose 
that be gathered in rayne. 
 
And those Hearbes that groweth 
in the Feldes are better than those 
that groweth in Townes, in
