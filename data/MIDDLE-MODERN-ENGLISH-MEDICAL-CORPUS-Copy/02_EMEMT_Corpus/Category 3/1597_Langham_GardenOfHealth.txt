[}Acatia.}] 
 
ACatia stoppeth the Laske, and the 
termes, and setteth the loose matrix 
in the naturall place being drunke 
with red wine. 2 It is good to be laid 
to serpigo or wilde fire, all inflamations 
and hot tumours, wheales, and 
hote blisters of the mouth, and with 
eye medicines to heale inflamations, 
blastings and swellings of the eyes 
being applied. 3 It maketh the haire blacke being often washed 
with the water wherein it hath beene soked: The leaues and 
tender crops of Acatia doe settle and strengthen members that 
are out of ioynt, if they be bathed in a hot bath, or stewe made with 
the broth thereof. 4 Being ground with vineger, it abateth the 
pusshes of the lepry. (See Sloes.) 5 In plasters it helpeth swellings, 
and humours in the eyes wonderfully, drinke it for the 
flixe, seethe it in the water of decoction of Pomegranates, or in 
vineger, and drink it to kill wormes. 6 Use it in a pessary to stop 
the flowers, to stop fluxes, vse subfumigatio~s thereof, or els drink 
it. Seede distilling vse Acatia. 7 It helpeth the holy fire, apostumes 
and woundes of the eyes, it stoppeth the termes, it healeth 
creeping sores, the falling of the matrix, it stayeth vomiting, and 
strengtheneth the stomake, and ceaseth paine. (See Sloes.)

[}Acorus, or Gladen.}] 
 
DRinke halfe a spoonefull of the pouder of the Roote with 
white wine, and vse it as much in thy pottage to heale the 
elfe cake and hardnesse of the side. 2 Stamp the roote and streine 
it with some Rew and Mints in Ale, and make possets therewith, 
and drinke the ale of them to expell vrine. 3 The broth of the 
roote procureth vrine, is good for the paines of the side, liuer and 
brest, the gnawing of the guts, drawings together or burstings, 
and for womens griefes as Iris is, it wasteth away the milte, 
and helpeth the strangurie, & the bitings of serpents. 4 Drinke 
a scruple of the roote against all inward bruises with foure ounces 
of honied wine. The roote is much vsed among preseruatiues 
and Treacles. 5 The broth is good against the swellings 
of the stones, and all hardnesse and gathering of humours being 
sodden in wine and laide to. 6 The iuice driueth away the 
darknesse of the eyes. 7 The roote punned with a little Verdigreice, 
a little of the roote of great Centorie and little hony, 
draweth foorth all kindes of thornes, splints, and broken bones. 
8 The roote mixt with vineger and applied, doeth consume and 
waste colde tumours and swellings. 9 The iuice rubbed on the 
place, driueth away and killeth the stinking wormes, and mothes 
called Cimici. 10 Halfe a dram of the seede taken with vineger 
wasteth and cureth the hardnesse of the milte. 11 For the griefes 
of the liuer and milte, bruise one pound of Acorus, and steepe it 
three dayes in vineger, then seethe it to the one halfe, then streine 
it, and put hony to it, and seethe it againe till the vineger be consumed, 
and take of this Oximel dayly in the morning with the decoction 
of Acorus. 12 If any beare Acorus about them, they 
shall not haue the bloody flixe, nor the crampe. 13 Seethe Acorus 
in water & vse for the plurisie, the griefes of the chest or brest, 
and of the liuer or milte, the strangurie and painefull making of 
[^p.3^] 
water. 14 Stampe the roote and seethe it in water to the third 
part, and drinke thereof three dayes, it doeth wonderfully bring 
forth the vrine, and healeth the strangurie. 
 
Note that the same roote or herbe is not to be vsed in Agues. 
Calamus Aromaticus, or the roote of Asarabacca may supply 
the want of it. (See in their places.) 
 
15 For the stitch in the side drinke pouder of it with a draught of 
Malmesie. 16 Tooth ache apply a piece of the roote to the tooth 
that aketh. 17 For venom or poyson drunke, stampe Gladen 
that groweth on hte grounde and Dragons, and drinke it with 
wine. 18 To dry vp wounds and to heale them vp with cleane 
flesh, although the bone be bare, apply powder of the roote with 
hony. 19 For the dropsie in the belly & feete, and to kill wormes, 
stampe a good quantity of the root and streine it in white wine and 
drinke it. 20 Fluxe to stop, seethe bramble berries in water of 
the decoction therof and vse it, but if thou haue an ache, bathe in 
the decoction of it, or wipe thee ouer with cloth weeted therein. 
 
21 Iaundies, bath in the decoction of Gladen and Ciclamen, 
or stampe them and drinke them with water and couer thee to 
sweate. 22 Flowers to cause, make a pessary of the roote, and 
anoynt it with oyle de Bay or common oyle, and cast thereon 
powder of Wallwort, and put it in all night till it prouoke it to 
bleede. 23 Prickes and bones to drawe out, stampe the roote 
and apply it. 24 Drinke it to heale bruisings. 25 Boyle it 
in water or ale, and streine it with hony, and boyle it againe, and 
scum it, and drinke it warme in the mornings two houres before 
meate to purge watrish humours, and for the dropsie. 26 The 
conserue thereof made with the pappe of the rootes, two or three 
times so much hony or rather sugar, comforteth the stomacke, and 
nourisheth and looseth tough flegme downe wardes marueilously, 
and is good for the sickenesse of the braine, and sinewes, and all 
diseases coming of flegme, and openeth the naturall course and 
the termes. 27 Stampe the roote of Gladen, and drinke it with 
stale Ale, and the iuice of Fumiterie morning and euen fifteene 
dayes, and vse this ointment therewith, stampe snayles, and Red 
dock rootes, and boyle them with Barrowes greace, and put 
thereto brimstone and Mercuerie ana, and anoynt any skab therewith, 
and bee whole though it be of seuen yeeres continuance. 
[^p.4^] 
28 To bring downe the flowers seethe Gladen rootes in strong 
vineger or wine and receiue vp the fume thereof into the matrix 
closely, &c. it neuer faileth, and therefore beware that you be not 
with childe. 29 Face euill coloured distill the rootes of Acorus, 
and of Turnips in a limbeck, and drinke thereof fiue ounces 
before meate fifteene dayes. 30 Stingings of serpents, apply 
powder of the vpper partes with wine. 31 To dissolue impostumes 
vnder the eare, boyle the rootes and stampe them with salt, 
and apply them. 32 Belly bound, drinke the iuice with the 
yolke of an egge hote as may bee suffered. 33 Milt griefes, 
drinke it with wine, sight to cleare put in the iuice.

ADders tongue, stampe it with Swines grease, and apply it 
to all swellings, inflamations, ring wormes, and shingles, 
and to heale all woundes and cuts with speede. 2 It is singular 
good to heale wounds both inward and outward, and for all burstings 
[^p.5^] 
and ruptures being sodden in wine and drunke. 3. Seeth 
it in water, and drinke it against all hot feuers, inflamations of the 
liuer, and all inward and outward heates. 3 Stampe it with 
swines grease, and vse it to all burning and spreading sores, hote 
swellings and impostumes, and the holy fire. 4 Apply it to a 
wound either greene or drie to heale it speedely, drinke the decoction 
of it to heale al inward wounds and al other griefes. Apply it 
to the newe ruptures of children, and binde it hard with a trusse. 
5 Seeth it with Sallet oyle while it is greene, and so it helpeth 
both swellings and sores, wounds, &c. 6. Being wrapt in Uirgins 
waxe, and put into the left eare of a horse, it causeth him to 
fall as if he were dead, but being taken out, he riseth againe.

[}Agnus castus.}] 
 
AGnus castus is a singular good remedy for all such as would 
liue chaste: for it withstandeth all filthie desire to lechery, it 
drieth vp the seede of generation, whether it be taken in powder 
or decoction, or that the leaues be strawed in the bed to sleepe vpon, 
and therefore is called chaste, cleane, or pure. 2 The seede 
drunke dissolueth the windinesse in the stomake, intralles, bowels, 
and matrix, and all other partes of the body, and openeth and cureth 
all hardnesse and stopping of the liuer and milte, and is good 
in the beginnings of dropsies, one ounce being drunke with wine. 
3 Taken by it selfe, or with Peneroiall, it prouoketh termes, and 
so it doeth, put in as a pessarie. 4. Some mixe it with oyles and 
ointments that are made to heate, mollifie, and heale the hard and 
stiffe membres that are waxen dead, sleepie, benommed or wearied, 
it cureth also the clifts and chops of the fundiment and great 
gut being laide to with water. 5 Agnus castus driueth all venemous 
[^p.6^] 
beastes from where it is scattered or burned. 6 It healeth 
all venemous bitings being applied, or the seede therof drunke. 
7 It helpeth hardnesse, stoppings, apostumations, and vlcers of 
the matrix, if women sit in the decoction or broth therof. 8 The 
leaues with butter doe dissolue the swellings of the coddes being 
applied. 9 A branch or rod thereof caried in the hand, defendeth 
the bearer from chafing and wearinesse. 10 The seede drunke 
increaseth milke. 11 With vineger and oyle, it is good for 
the frensie and letargie. 12 The leaues sodden in wine and 
honie, heale the vlcers and sores of the mouth and gummes. 
13 For satyriasis or standing of the yarde, eate the seedes thereof, 
or seethe it in wine, and plaster it to the reines and secret partes. 
14 Agnus castus sodden in vineger with Fenell, is good against 
the dropsie. 15 Sodden in salt water with Sage and Smallage, 
and the hinder part of the head washed therewith, helpeth the letargie. 
16 Being either drunke or caried about one, it taketh away 
luste. 17 A plaister thereof applied, helpeth the head ache 
that commeth of euill humors. (See Tutsan.)

[}Alecost, Costmary, or Maudlinwort.}] 
 
ALecost, Costmary, or Maudlinwort, either alone or with 
Persnipseedes boyled in wine and drunke, cureth the gripings 
and torments of the belly or guts, and the flixe. 2 The 
conserue of the leaues made with sugar, doth warme and drie the 
braine, and open the stopping therof, and helpeth reumes & distillations 
taken in quantitie of a beane. 3. Used in meates, as 
[^p.7^] 
Sage and other hearbes, especially in sallads and sawses (for the 
which it is excellent) it yeldeth a proper sent or taste: Alecost and 
Maudlin be of equall vertues, they comfort the stomake. 4 The 
iuice drunke killeth wormes both small and great: it is good for 
the cold mother, it strengtheneth y=e= stomake, whether it be drunke 
or applied, and stayeth vomiting. 5 The herbe strawed or burned 
driueth away serpents, and is good against their poysons. 
6 Being sodden in wine and drunke, it is good for them that haue 
drunke Opium, or other venemous things, and for biting of serpents, 
especially one dramme of y=e= powder of the roote thereof taken 
in wine, with the like waight of the seedes of wilde Persnips. 
7 It hath the nature of Feuerfue in all things, and it is good for 
women to sit in the decoction thereof to prouoke sweate, and to 
drawe downe the termes, and auoide the paine that commeth by 
retention of them. 8 The same stamped and applied taketh away 
hardnesse and swelling in any place. 9. The flowers of 
Maudlinwort sodden and drinke, killeth great wormes in the 
belly, causeth sweate, and openeth the obstructions of the liuer, 
milte, kidness and bladder. The hearbe sodden in water is 
good for the hardnesse and swelling of the belly & matrix. 10 The 
flowers sodden in lee, and the head washed therewith, taketh away 
the skurfe and skab thereof, and killeth lice: the flowres laide among 
clothes, defendeth them from mothes. 11 Stampe the 
hearbe with Melilote, and apply it but once to cuts of veines to 
heale them: eate the powder thereof with honie for the griefes of 
the mouth. 12 It healeth the greefes of the breast & lungs, it 
breaketh impostumes, draweth euill humors from the head, and is 
good for the stomake. 13 use it to drawe euill humors from the 
eyes, and for the griefes of the breast, lungs, stomake, and reines.

ALkakengie, red Nightshad, or Winterchery, the leaues are

serueth for, as Morrell it selfe outwardly, but not to bee eaten. 
2 The fruite openeth the stopping of the liuer and kidneis, cleanseth 
the bladder, and prouoketh vrine. 3 And therfore very good

[}Allder.}] 
 
ALder is good against impostumes and swellings in the 
throte, and kernels, or almonds vnder the tongue euell as 
well as the shales or greene pilles of Walnuts, it dieth blacke colour. 
2 The leaues be much vsed against hot swellings, vlcers, 
and all inward inflamations. 3 The same are good to bee put 
into the shooes of them that are surbated and wearie, to mitigate 
the heate and paine. 4 The greene leaues with their dewe in the 
mornings, are good to be strawed in chambers to voyde fleas, the 
chamber being first swept. The barke with olde iron put into water, 
maketh blacke as inke. The wood neuer rotteth in water nor 
in moyst ground, but rather turneth into stone. 5 The iuice of 
the barke is good for a burning. 6 the iuice of blacke Allder 
which is yellowe, being steeped in wine or beere and drunke, causeth 
to vomit vehemently, & cleanseth the stomake. 7 The same 
[^p.11^] 
boyled in vineger and holden in the mouth, swageth tooth ache, 
and cureth skurfe and fretting sores being applied. The leaues 
cause kine to giue good store of milke, if they eate them, for they 
are good fodder.

[}Angelica.}] 
 
ANgelica is good against all poyson and venemous bitings, 
so that it is better to haue it & Magistrantia, Louage, Gentian, 
Elecampana, Aristolochia, & Petasites, then al Arabike and 
forraine wares. 2 It is called the roote of the holy Ghost, and of 
all heale: it expelleth poyson and rotten blood, and warmeth the 
body. 3 Halfe a dramme of the roote, with one dramme of Triacle 
drunke with three or foure spoonefull of the water thereof, 
and the body well couered to sweate, and forbearing other things 
three houres after it, driueth foorth the plague, and deliuereth the 
sicke body, if no Treacle can be had, take a whole dramme of the 
powder of the roote. 4 The roote smelled vnto being steeped in 
vineger, and a little of the vineger drunke fasting now and then in 
the plauge time, preserueth the body from the plague. 5 The 
water of powder of the roote deliuereth the body from torments 
comming of colde, the pluresie, ruptures, griefes of the lunges, 
whereof come grieuous coughes, the dropping of the vrine, the 
[^p.26^] 
strangurye, the stopping of the flowers, swellings and windines, 
and such like, and so doeth decoctions and potions made with the 
roote thereof sodden in wine or honie. 6 Put the water into hollowe 
teeth for their ache, and into the eares for their ache. 7 Put 
the iuice or water into the eyes to cleare them and sharpen the 
sight, and to take away the webs & mystinesse: put the iuice, water, 
or powder into olde and deepe vlcers, to couer the bare bones 
with flesh. 8 Apply the water to the goute, sciatica, or any ache 
or bruises, to dissolue humors that are gathered together: mixe the 
powder with pitch, and apply it to all venemous bitings. 9 The 
seedes haue the same vertues that the rootes haue: the rootes, 
seede or water, is excellent good against all inward diseases: it 
scowreth the gatherings of the plurisie when it beginneth: it helpeth 
corrupt lungs, it is good against the chollike and strangurie, 
it prouoketh termes, it helpeth inflamations and swellings. 
10 Drop the iuice of the roote into the eyes to quicken the sight, 
and to clense them from all filth, and put it into teeth that ake to 
auoide the ache. 11 The water or powder is excellent good against 
rotten vlcers and kankerous sores to clense and heale them: 
put a piece of gold into the iuice of Limons 24. houres, and drinke 
it with a little wine and powder of the roote of Angelica, to helpe 
the plague though all hope were past. 12 The roote taken fasting, 
or but holden in the mouth, preserueth the body from all infection 
of the plague or poyson. 13 If any be infected, let them 
drinke one dram of the powder straightwayes in Winter with 
wine, and with water of Scabious, or of Carduus benedictus in 
Sommer, or with Rose water, and couer him well to sweate both 
for the plague and poyson. 14 The leaues stampt with Rue and 
Honie, are very good for the bitings of mad dogs, serpents, and 
vipers, if shortly after the hurt taken, the partie drinke of the wine 
wherein the leaues or roote haue beene sodden. 15 For the pestilence, 
any sudden pestilent ague, or too much sudden sweating, 
drinke halfe a dramme of the pouder of the root with one dram of 
Treacle, and iii. or iiii. spoonefull of water of the roote, and couer 
thee well to sweate iii. houres. 16 It is good for all inward diseases, 
especially such as come of colde cause, and for women in 
trauell, it expelleth winde. 17 The roote or seede may be sodden 
in wine or water as the disease requireth, and so it healeth all inward 
[^p.27^] 
vlcers, bruses, and congealed blood, and strengtheneth the 
stomake. 18 The powder of the roote is good against all swooning 
passions of the heart, it is gathered in Autumne, and kept 
two or three yeeres, it cleanseth the lungs, breast, guts, reines and 
bladder. 19 The hearbe sodden in water, healeth all inwarde 
wounds, strengtheneth the heart, and dryeth vp all superfluous 
moysture, as the dropsie and tympany. 20 It helpeth against vomiting 
and weakenesse of the stomake, and being sodden with 
Rue, hony and wine, it deliuereth from the bitings of serpents, 
snakes, &c. and also any pricke or wound. 21 It quencheth all 
carnall rage of youthfull lust, if one eate halfe a dramme of it: it 
hath many other vertues, for the which fewe hearbes are to be 
compared vnto it. 22 Tooth-ache put in a peece of the roote, 
breath stinking of garlike chawe it, it may be vsed for like purposes 
as Carduus benedictus. 23 Powder of the leafe or roote 
cleanseth and healeth rotten vlcers, kankers and sores, and couereth 
the bones with flesh, (See Blessed thistle.) 
 
Swooning and all passions of the heart, drinke two ounces of 
Angelica water, with a little Cinamon water, and one scruple 
of powder of the roote sundry mornings.
