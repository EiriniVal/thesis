[^Extract 1, ff. B1v-G4v^] 
 
[^f.B1v^] 
FOR the dislike that I haue conceiued in the vse and practise 
of Tabacco, I take it to be grounded on eight principall 
reasons and arguments. 
 
1 First, that in their vse or custome, no methode or order 
is obserued. Diuersitie and distinction of persons, tymes 
and seasons considered, no varietie of accidents and diseases 
pondered. 
 
2 Secondly, for that it is in qualitie and complexion more hot 
and drye then may be conueniently vsed dayly of any man: 
much lesse of the hot and cholericque constitution. 
 
3 Thirdly, for that it is experimented and tryed to be a most 
strong and violent purge. 
 
4 Fourthly, for that it withereth and drieth vp naturall moisture 
in our bodies, therby causing sterrilitie and barrennesse: 
In which respect it seemeth an enemie to the continuaunce 
and propagacion of mankinde. 
 
5 Fiftly, for that it decayeth and dissipateh naturall heate, that 
kindly warmeth in vs, and thereby is cause of crudities and 
rewmes, occasions of infinit maladies. 
 
6 Sixtly, for that this herb or rather weed, seemeth not voide 
of venome and poison, and thereby seemeth an enemie to the 
lyfe of man. 
 
7 Seauenthly, for that the first author and finder hereof was 
the Diuell, and the first practisers of the same were the Diuells 
Priests, and therefore not to be vsed of vs Christians. 
 
8 Last of all, because it is a great augmentor of all sorts of melancholie 
in our bodies, a humor fit to prepare our bodies to 
receaue the prestigations and hellish illusions and impressions 
of the Diuell himselfe: in so much that many Phisitions 
and learned men doe hold this humour to be the verie seate 
of the Diuell in bodies possessed. 
 
[^f.B2r^] 
[}A VVarning for 
Tabcconists. 
 
The first Reason.}] 
 
TOuching the first; Where no method 
or order is vsed, ther resteth 
in all artes and other actions humaine, 
naught else but dissolation 
and confusion, a thing, as in 
the Common weale it is pernicious, 
so in the preseruation of 
mans health it hath been alwaies 
adiudged most dangerous. 
 
But that in these our daies, in this land of England, 
this new come simple of the West commonly knowne 
with vs by the name of Tabacco: is without all method 
and order of most men receiued, may be apparant by 
this, that it is taken early in the morning, and also very 
late at night: in the morning fasting, and in the euening 
feasting and on a full stomacke. In the beginning, middle, 
and ende of meales. To be short, at all times, at all 
houres, and of all persons, this Indian stranger most familiarly 
is receiued: for the smoake of Tabacco seemeth 
to the fauorits thereof at no time vnseasonable. Neither 
that it ought to bee tied to reasons and rules (being 
perhaps a thing in it selfe more irregular and vnreasonable) 
seeing that by experience (as they thinck) 
they haue found great good & profit by the vse therof. 
 
They boast much of this their experience as a sufficient 
[^f.B2v^] 
ground for this their disorder. But their experience 
not grounded on reason, but rather repugnant 
thereto, and contrary to common sence also, is a motiue 
sufficient for the simple, but no way an argument 
for the wiser sort, to daunce after their vnsauory and 
vnpleasant Tabacco pipe. 
 
[/1./] 
Galen in his Comment on his first booke of Hippocrates 
Aphorismes: sheweth that the art of Phisicke standeth 
on two legges, Reason and Experience: Whereof 
if either bee wanting, the whole art is lame and maimed. 
 
[/2./] 
For as Reason without Experience is very vncertaine: 
so is Experience without Reason very perillous and dangeroes; 
especially in matters inwardly to be taken and 
receiued into mens bodies, the which as they are diuers 
and differing in nature and complection, so are 
they also diuersly in diet to bee ordered, and by farre 
contrary medicines in their sicknesses cured. 
 
[}For Example.}] 
 
[/3./] 
The diet conuenient for youth, is no waies agreeable 
to old age: neither is that diet which is appropriat 
to elder yeeres, any way profitable to youthfull 
and growing age. 
 
And bodies of temper dry, require things in nature 
and qualitie moist. But moist complections and maladies 
growing of superfluities of humours, are more 
commonly remedied by things of nature drying and 
[/4./] 
disiccatiue. By which last meanes wee see by experience, 
that some diseased of the dropsie (no doubt a 
colde and moist affect) haue receiued great helpe by 
the frequeut vse of this Tabacco. For the siccety, & dri'th 
[^f.B3r^] 
of this simple, together with his heat, in a body hidropicall, 
hauing fit matter & great store of cold humors 
to worke vpon, doth no doubt in that respect further 
their health, and yet can it not be iustly inferred heere 
of, that Tabacco simply taken without respect of times, 
persons, sexe, age, temperament and disease, any waies 
to be either profitable or else commendable. 
 
[/5./] 
Also fasting and abstinence for meate is assigned 
by Hippocrates in his Aphorismes, for a good remedie against 
full and repleat bodies. 
 
[/6./] 
Abstinuisse decet nimium quibus humida membra, 
humida desiccat corpora nempe fames. 
 
But yet the same Hippocrates denieth that kinde of 
abstinence to bee any waies conuenient for growing 
yeeres, or for the sicke of feuers consuming, & for such 
as are not accustomed therevnto. 
 
[/7./] 
Humidior victus pueris pariterq; suetis, 
Conuenit, accensis corporibusq; febri. 
 
[/8./] 
Moreouer some bodies receiue helpe and ease by 
purging and euacuation, as the bodies of wrestlers, & 
such as are come to the top and extreame height of fulnesse, 
of whom Hippocrates speaketh of in his 3. Aphorisme 
of his booke. 
 
[/9./] 
Ad summam veniens habitudo athletica molem 
noxia, cum non quo progrediatur habet. 
Vno namque statu cum non consistere possit, 
est in deterius retro necesse ruat. 
Vnde fit vt corpus confestim soluere possit, 
quo poterit rursus conuenienter ali. 
 
And yet the same author in his Aphorismes doth testifie, 
purges no way to bee conuenient for sound and 
[^f.B3v^] 
healthie bodies: for saith hee, 
 
Sana corpora difficulter purgantia medicamenta 
ferunt, et cito a purgantibus exoluuntur. 
 
And to be short, neither one nor the other remedy 
can in any respect preuaile, if it be applied out of his 
due time and season: for, 
 
[/10./] 
Temporibus medicina valet, data tempore prosunt, 
et data non apto tempore vina nocent. 
 
And truely as no one kinde of diet can fit all sorts of 
bodies: So no one kinde of remedie can aptly be applied 
to all maladies, no more then one shooe can wel 
serue all mens feete. 
 
What reason therfore haue these Tabacconists (I pray 
you) to offer this their Tabacco after one and the selfe 
same order to all men, ages, and complections indifferently, 
making no scruple of the fitnesse of time, quality 
of the disease, or temperament of the person to 
whom they offer it. 
 
What thing can be more absurd and phantasticall, 
then to minister one & the selfe same remedy to contrary 
& repugnant affects, hot & cold, dry and moist, 
emptie and repleat, acute and cronicall, which for the 
more part haue deeper rootes, and are of longer continuance, 
then can sodenly be blowne away with a puffe 
of a smokie Tabacco pipe, yea & some of them can hardly 
be remoued by the great paynes, care & cunning of 
the expert and learned in Phisicke: for, 
 
Non est in medico semper releuetur vt æger 
Interdum docta plus valet arte malum. 
 
[/11./] 
And yet these Tabacco fauorits hold no disease so incurable 
but that in some measure it receiueth either 
[^f.B4r^] 
cure or ease by this Tabacco. 
 
But I assure you many diseases being of themselues 
and their owne nature, light and of easie cure, may by 
the vntimely vse of this same, become altogether incurable, 
such are, the first step or degree to an Heticke, distemper 
of heat in the Liuer, oppilations of the Lungs, 
and such like. 
 
And truely if nothing else should make one out of 
fancie with the vse of Tabacco, it might be sufficient for 
an equall iudge to thinck with himself how vnnaturall 
a thing it is to peruert the naturall vse & offices of the 
parts of the bodie, for by the force of Tabacco the 
mouth, throte, and stomacke, (appointed by nature for 
the receipt of food & nourishment for the whole body) 
are made emunctuary clensing places and sincks, 
(supplying heerein the office of the most abiect and 
basest part) for the filth and superfluous excrements of 
the whole body. 
 
[}The second Reason.}] 
 
THe second reason against the ordinarie 
vse of Tabacco, is taken from the excesse 
of his two manifest qualities of heat 
and dri'th, which Monardus and others 
also haue affirmed to come neere to the 
third degree of excesse in either qualitie. 
 
So that if men of hot and dry constitution should 
often vse the feume of Tabacco, no doubt they should 
increase much their distemper, for like added to his 
like, increaseth the resemblance & similitude the more 
[^f.B4v^] 
[/12./] 
according to that Axiome in Philosophie. Omne simile additum 
simili reddia ipsum magis simile. Whervpon Aristotle 
[/13./] 
in his 8. booke and 29. Chap. De animalibus, inferreth, 
that a Snake if he eate of a Scorpion waxeth farre 
more venemous then he was before. 
 
But I neede not to stand long vpon this point, seeing 
that daily practise & experience teachth vs, that heat 
increaseth heat, & things cold, do increase in vs a greaer 
cold, the like may bee said of the other qualities of 
dri'th and moisture, so that in natural reason and common 
sence it seemeth true that the extreame & violent 
dri'th & heat of Tabacco, maketh it far vnfit & vnwholsome 
for thin & cholericke bodies. And so is it also for 
youth and such as grow, for Qui crescunt plurimum habent 
innati caloris, this naturall heat in youth, by the immoderate 
vse of this fierie fume would soone turne 
vnto a heat vnnaturall, and thereby be occasion of infinite 
maladies. 
 
But I hold it a thing very dangerous, not onely for 
the yonger sort, but also for all other ages and constitutions 
whatsoeuer, to bee ouer bold with Tabacco. For 
it doth not onely consume and dissipate naturall heat 
in them (by increasing of the vnnaturall) but it wasteth 
also & drieth vp radicall moisture (the principall 
subiect of natiue heat) so that heereof insueth in the 
bodie great store of crud & vndigested humours, the 
effects of immoderate heat in vs. 
 
For it is not fierie nor immoderate heat in vs, but 
rather a milde & vnctuous warmth, consisting in a temperate 
& moderate moisture that performeth as well 
concoction as all other naturall actions in vs. 
 
[^f.C1r^] 
Which thing is very apparant & conspicuous in such 
as are afflicted with hot & burning Feuers: In whom 
as the fierie heat appeareth most, so crude and vndigested 
humours doe abound more then in such as are 
cleare of such extremitie of heates. Neither doe their 
humors at any time come to perfect digestion in them, 
vntill the rigor and violence of that fierie heate be in 
some sort (by cooling diet and medicine) repressed. 
 
Much lesse therefore are the patrons of Tabacco to 
bee beeleeued in this, that hot and burning Agues (rising 
of corruption and putrefaction of choler & blood 
in the veines or about the principall parts of mans bodie) 
may bee cured with an infusion of Tabacco leafe 
in white Wine steeped all night. 
 
For as it was euer an aphorisme & maxime in Phisicke, 
that as like is maintayned by his like, So was it 
also of like certaintie in the same art, that Contraria a 
contrarijs currantur. Contraries are cured by their contraries. 
I meane contrary rather to the disease, or to 
the cause of the disease. 
 
But what contrarietie I pray you can be found betweene 
Tabacco and a Feuer tercian or burning Ague: 
When as they manifestly agree in their principall qualities 
of heate and dri'th: both equally falling in excesse 
of either of them; The like may be said of other 
effects proceeding of the same of like causes. 
 
But to let the diseased passe, and to come to those 
which are of perfect health, I take it very dangerous 
and hurtfull for them often to vse this Tabacco feume: 
for therby great part of that humour is dissipated, wasted, 
spent & cast foorth of the body by often vomits, 
[^f.C1v^] 
seeges, swets and continnall spittings and coughings, 
which in processe of time would turne to good blood, 
and holsome nurrishment for the bodie. 
 
For Crude and watrish humors (which for the most 
part are all those which by this medicine are) are 
oftentimes very necessary for many vses in the body: 
As for pliant motion of the Ioints, and principally for 
nurrishment of the flegmaticke and colder parts. 
 
And it is a receiued opinion amongst the best Phisitions 
that nature (being a prouident & carefull nurce of 
mankinde) hath purposely left this Crudie humour in 
our bodyes, to the intent that we might euer haue 
some thing in store to nourish vs, if happely we should 
at any time want other foode. 
 
[/14./] 
But that no small part of our nurishment is drawne 
away by the vntimely vse of this Tabacco, may manifestly 
appeare by those men, who before the vse thereof 
were grose and soggy, but after they haue acquainted 
themselues with this kinde of practise, they became very 
leane and sclender. 
 
So that no doubt, if they desist not in time from farther 
vse therof, ther is no small suspition least that they 
shall therby fall into Consumptions, & to that of the most 
dangerous sorts called of the Phisition, Marasmos proceding 
of want of substanciall nurrishment, & dissipation 
of naturall heat and decay of spirits in the body. 
 
And heerein I cannot but wonder much at the ouer 
sight of some, who otherwise being learned and wise, 
yet in this seeme very Paradoxicall, when as they contend 
to proue Tabacco to be a great nurrisher. For beesides 
that, it is manifest that it taketh away great part of 
[^f.C2r^] 
our nurrishment, by the extreame euacuation it procureth, 
it is also (by meanes of his great heat & drynesse) 
very vnapt to breed any good nurishment in vs. 
 
To this may bee added, his vnpleasaunt and vngratefull 
smell, insomuch that the tasters thereof 
beare away with them in their bodyes and breath, 
the loathsome Tabacco sent, long time after. 
 
So that it is very euident and manifest that as well in 
respect of his substance (ouer hot & dry) as also of his 
vnpleasing & stinking sent, it is neither fit to nurish the 
humerall & solide parts, nor yet apt to refresh & comfort 
the spirits of man, be they naturall in the Liuer, vitall 
in the hart, or sensible or animall in the braine and 
sinewes. For as touching the humours in vs, they are 
aptest nourished by such things as are either humorall 
and moyst, or else may easely bee turned and conuerted 
into a liquid and thin substance. 
 
And as for the hard and solede parts of the body, as 
bones, sinewes, vaines & artires they cannot receiue 
any nutriment of any thing before it bee first turned 
into some moist and liquid substance also apt to be suked, 
& drunck into the former parts, & afterward by the 
force of natures worke, assimulated, hardened, & transformed 
into the very nature & substance of the parts 
by it nurished. But as for the spirits, it hath ben a question 
much disputed on amongst the Philosophers, (as 
Aristotle, Plato, and others) of old time, & their expositers 
since; whether smels or odours may any wayes 
nourish the same. And (if I be not deceiued) they all 
agree in this, that mens spirits doe feele great comfort 
and refreshing by such sweet and pleasant sauours as 
[^f.C2v^] 
are founded & subiected in some moyst & vnctuous 
matter. But this priuiledge cannot in any respect bee 
graunted to Tabacco, both for that hir sauour is very vnsauorie 
& stincking, & also because it is placed & founded 
in a very dry and withered substance Insomuch 
as that the tasters and drinckers thereof, thincke it not 
fit to bee taken, vntill it bee thoroughly parched and 
dryed, that thereby it might the better receiue the 
force of the fire, & the sooner be kindled therwith. 
 
[/15./] 
Now that sweet and pleasant sauours & delightfull 
fumes, doe greatly refresh our spirits and recreate the 
sences, it is euidently perceiued by our vsuall practise: 
When to the feeble and languishing persons, and to 
such as faint or sound, we presently offer them the 
sent of Rosewater mixed with a little vineger, that it 
might the more speedely peirce; and the sicke person 
feeleth great comfort thereby. 
 
[/16./] 
But on the contrary, stincking & filthie smels, are so 
far from refreshing vs, as that they vtterly extinguish & 
quell our spirits in vs; and to some procure hastie and 
vntimely deaths, or at the least some vncurable maladies, 
and loathsome diseases. 
 
[/17./] 
Ambrose Parye a French Chirurgion not vnlearned, & 
in his profession most expert, reporteth of himselfe in 
the 12. Chapter of his treatise of the plague, that visiting 
a certaine pacient of his, that had by meanes of 
the plague a botch in his flancke or groyne, and other 
blanes elsewhere in his body: Whilst rashly hee vnfolded 
the bed clothes, the better to take view of the 
sores, hee was sodainely stroke into a sound with the 
stincke & loathsome breath that steymed from these 
[^f.C3r^] 
vlcers, & perced vp to his braine through his nosthrils, 
in such sort as that he hardly recouered his life. Afterward 
being recalled to his sence & feeling againe, hee 
thought the house wherled round, & had fallen sodenly 
downe againe, if happely he had not taken better 
holde of the bed post, and stayed himselfe. 
 
How noysome and irkesome a thing vnpleasant and 
stincking sauours be to the braynes of men may easely 
bee coniectured by the vsuall custome of most men, 
who neuer passe by any vnsauory place, but they 
streight wayes stop their noses & mouthes with their 
hands or other meanes, least that the ill vapor or stench 
therof should any waies offend or loath their braine. 
 
But to come to our Tabacco, if any man doubt of his 
[/18./] 
ill sauour & bad sent, I refer him to the report of those, 
who haue had longest tryall therof. No doubt, except 
they be altogether shamelesse, they will truely informe 
him therof. I remember that being called once to the 
cure of an honorable Earle now departed this life, amongst 
[/19./] 
other learned and expert Phisitions, there 
hapned one to be called, who as in times past he was 
Chimicall, so in the vntimely vse of this plant he seemed 
to bee ouer fantasticall. It fortuned the very morning 
that he came vnto his Honors presence, he had (according 
to his accustomed wont) taken his mornings 
draft of Tabacco, with the fume wherof, he so perfumed 
his Lordships bedchamber in such sort, as that the 
Earle being meruaylous anoyed therwith, told me after 
the departure of the former Phisition, that from 
thence foorth hee had rather lose the benefit of that 
mans counsell in Phisicke, then to indure such a horrible 
[^f.C3v^] 
a fume againe. This good D. being demaunded of 
other Phisitions, (wherof two were hir Maiesties) the~ 
present, what reason he had for this his custome; answered 
that he would not but for 100 pounds he had 
vsed this feume at first, for thereby he found great ease 
for his cold reumatick & stomacke. But now said he, I 
would that I could so easely leaue it, condicionallie I 
had giuen 300 pounds more, for I finde my selfe hart 
sick that day, till I haue tasted thereof. 
 
No doubt the long and dailie vse of drincking Tabacco, 
had accustomed his stomack to draw to it watrish 
and rewmetick matter in great aboundance, the quantitie 
wherof, vrged nature to seeke meanes for the expelling 
the same againe, which could, by no other 
thing be more fitly performed then by Tabacco it selfe. 
 
For as it hath a powre & faculty to draw to the stomacke, 
(as other strong purges haue) so likewise hath 
it a property and vertue to expell forth the same, no otherwise 
then all other purges haue. But heerein it differeth 
from other purges, that it seemeth to be of a far 
more thin & subtile nature then other purges bee, by 
meanes wherof, nature is so pricked and forced oftentimes 
in such violent sort, as that it causeth violent euacuation, 
as well by stoole vomits and swetes, as also 
by saliuacion, coughing & spittings, which thing other 
purges vsually doe not, albeit they be very forceable, 
violent and strong. 
 
So that heereof is gathered the fourth reason beefore 
aleadged, that Tabacco is not familiarly to be vsed 
beecause it is a vehement and violent purge. 
 
[^f.C4r^] 
[}The third Reason.}] 
 
I Neede not stand long on this 
[/20./] 
point, to proue Tabacco to bee a 
strong and violent purge: for that 
in daily practise & common experience 
the same is most euide~t 
and manifest to most men. And 
to doubt of that which of it selfe 
is perspicuous, were grose stupiditie, and to denie that 
which is to our sence most cleere and euident, were 
a point next to extreame folly. 
 
The often scowrings, fluxes, vomets, swetes, and 
other immoderate euacuations insident to this simple, 
doe testifie the same to purge most violently. 
 
Furthermore, Tabacco is found to be of that stre~gth 
& force, that the verie maceration or infusion of one 
leafe thereof in white wine ouernight doth procure 
strong and extreame vomits. 
 
It is as yet fresh in memorie, that diuers yong 
Gentlemen, by the daylie vse of this Tabacco, haue 
brought themselues to flixes and disenteries, and of 
late at Bath a Scholler of some good accompt and 
[/21./] 
worshipfull calling, was supposed to haue perished 
by this practise, for his humours beeing sharpened 
and made thin by the frequent vse of Tabacco, after 
that they had once taken a course downward, they 
ran in such violence, as that by no Art or Phisicks 
skill they could be stayed, till the man most miserably 
ended his life, being then in the verie prime and vigour 
[^f.C4v^] 
of his age. 
 
But no purge, (be he familiar or gentle, or else violent 
and hurtfull) ought by the rules of Phisicke to 
bee familiarly and daily vsed of any man that hath respect 
either of his life, or regard to his health. 
 
[/22./] 
For as concerning such as are in perfect health Hippocrates 
the Prince of Phisitions in the 36. Aphorisme of 
his second booke affirmeth: Corpora sana si per medicamenta 
purgantur exoluuntur celeriter; & quæ prauo cibo 
vtuntur. Sound and healthie bodies (sayth he) soone 
wast and consume, by the vse of purging medicines. 
In like case doe they which feede on corrupt and vnwholesome 
meates. 
 
[/23./] 
Likewise the same author in the 37. Aphorisme of 
the former booke, sayth, that Qui corpora habent commoderata 
ijs purgationes difficiles sunt. To such as are in 
health purging medicines are very dangerous. And 
truely this his assertion seemeth to be grounded vpon 
good & substanciall reason. For wheras the vertue and 
operacion of the purge is to draw & expell foorth of 
the body such corrupt & vnholsome humours as haue 
any affinitie or likenesse in substance with the purge; & 
in healthy bodyes finding none of that disposition & 
nature, the purge then either loseth his operation and 
action, & therby is conuerted into some bad humour 
in the bodie, or else it draweth and expelleth foorth 
humours very profitable & necessary for the nurrishment 
and sustentation of the body. And therefore 
all purges must needes bee to sound and healthy bodyes 
very perillous and dangerous. 
 
[^f.E1r^] 
And as for sicke and diseased men, they ought onely 
to vse purging remedies at such times as their bodies 
and humours shall be made fit and apt for the operatio~ 
of the purge, according to that counsell of Hippocrates 
in his tenth Aphorisme of his second booke, saying: 
Purganti quoties vacuas medicamine corpus, 
quo bene res Cedat, fluxile redde prius. 
 
So often as thou purgest, so often also ought you 
[/24./] 
to make your bodies apt thereto, and the humours (to 
be purged) fluxible, that the parts and passages of the 
body being open, and the humours apt to runne, the 
purgation might worke with lesse torments and griefe 
to the partie purged. 
 
So that it seemeth very apparant true, that neither 
in health, nor yet in sicknesse, that so vntimely and vulgar 
vse of Tabacco (beeing before prooued a violent 
purge) can be vsed without great hurt and danger. 
 
Neither ought this kind of remedie to be giuen at 
any time, but in causes of extremitie, and in desperate 
diseases onely. For that it is an extreame and desperate 
medicine. Extremis enim morbis extrema remedia adhibe~da 
[/25./] 
sunt, saith our Hippocrates. And in his comment vpon 
the same Aphorisme, sheweth all strong purges to be 
reckoned amongst extreame remedies. 
 
[}The fourth Reason.}] 
 
THe fourth argume~t against this newcome 
simple, was that it drieth vp 
and withereth our vnctuous and radicall 
moisture in vs, and therby seemeth 
an vtter enemie to the continuance 
and propagation of mankinde. 
This may be prooued in this sort. 
 
[^f.E1v^] 
That thing which depriueth the body of norishme~t 
and foode, doth also wither & dry vp our naturall and 
radical moisture: (because this hath his refreshing and 
sustentation from the purest part of the blood ingendred 
of our nourishments). But Tabacco was shewed 
before to depriue vs of our norishment, in that it spendeth 
and euacuateth out of vs by spitting and sweats 
& otherwise much of that matter that in time would 
proue in vs good blood & good foode for our bodies. 
And therefore Tabacco must needs be said to be a great 
decaier and witherer of our radicall moysture before 
specified. 
 
Moreouer Tabacco by meanes of his great heat and 
immeasurable drinesse, dissipateth naturall heate and 
kinde warm'th in our bodies, and thereby is cause of 
defect of good concoction & perfect disgestion in vs. 
The humors therfore in vs by this meanes made crude 
and rawe, can be no fit aliment or nutriment for the 
vnctuous and substantiall humiditie, wherin with moderate 
and kindly heate the Philosopher esteemed the 
life of man to consist. 
 
And last of all, wheras the sperme & seed of man, is 
supposed (by the Phisitians & natural Philosophers also) 
to be framed of the purest & finest part of his blood 
by the actio~ & vertue of kindly warm'th working therin; 
the blood being now vndigested & crude, and the 
naturall heate peruerted & corrupted by the immoderate 
vse of this hellish smoake, reeking foorth of Plutoes 
forge, what sperme or seed shall we expect to come fro~ 
them that daily vse or rather shamefully abuse this so 
apparant an enemy to the propagation therof, as wel if 
you respect the materiall cause of seed consisting in the 
[^f.E2r^] 
perfectest & most concocted parts of the blood) as his 
efficie~t (resting in the moderatio~ of naturall heat) both 
greatly altered and decayed by the vse of Tabacco. 
 
Hereby it must needs in co~sequent follow, that the 
continuation & propagation of mankinde (consisting 
principally in his perfect & vncorrupt seed) is in these 
men much abridged. 
 
And for certaine proofe that Tabacco dryeth vp the 
sperme & seed of man, I heare by faithfull relation of 
such as haue much vsed it; That whereas before the vse 
thereof, they had bene long molested with a fluxe of 
seed, co~monly called with vs the running of the reines, 
and of the Phisitian Gomorrhæa, (proceeding in them 
by reason of great quantitie & abundance of that matter 
seeking vent forth of the bodie) they were in short 
space eased of this affect by the onely vse of this medicine. 
For no doubt, this fierie fume, dried vp the superfluitie 
of that matter, which by reason of her thin and 
great quantitie, easily dropped from them. But if they 
persist ouer long in the practise therof, no doubt more 
of that spermaticall humiditie wil be dried vp in them, 
the will be conuenient for their health, or for the increase 
of their like; wherby the propogatio~ & co~tinuation 
of mankind in this world must need be abridged. 
 
[}The fift Reason.}] 
 
THe fift argument against Tabacco 
was, that it dissipateth naturall heate, 
and thereby was occasion of rawe 
and vndigested humours in the bodie. 
 
This thing in part hath bene demo~strated 
before in the chap. precedent, 
[^f.E2v^] 
to which may here be added, that where naturall 
and kind heat is by any meane made more violent and 
fiery, there the parts of the body are made more hard 
and dried, and thereby the more vnfit and vnapt to 
drinke or receiue into them such liquid and moist matter, 
as by the daily foode should accrue and grow to 
them. Wherevpon it falleth forth, that that humiditie 
that should bee conuerted into the nature & substance 
of the sollide parts, is made (by meanes of their not admission 
thereof) excrementall and superfluous. 
 
For it is not a thing either strange or absurd in Philosophie, 
that things of qualitie drie, may by an accidentall 
meanes, be cause of superfluous moisture. We 
see this thing confirmed by Galen himself, in his second 
[/26./] 
booke and second Chapter, De temperamentis, and also 
by Auicen. 
 
We see by experience, that old persons being naturally 
drie in their sollide parts, and haue for that cause, 
their skin parched, their faces withered, their sinewes 
stiffe, their backes stouping, and yet who doubteth but 
such persons haue in their intrailes and inward parts, 
great store of flegmaticke and excrementall moistures, 
proceeding of want of good digestian and concoction 
in those parts. 
 
And truly those superfluities do the more abound 
in them, for that their firme and sollide parts (as Sinewes, 
Bones, & Flesh, Veines, Artiers, and Ligame~ts) 
are too drie and hard to receiue and sucke vp so much 
of that alimentall humour which Nature dooth daily 
send to them for their sustenance and reliefe. 
 
And hereof is seene in daily experience, that olde 
folk are troubled most with rewmes, Catarres, coughs, 
[^f.E3r^] 
spatterings, vomits, scourings, and such like. 
 
And that old age is naturally drie and hard, Galen 
[/27./] 
declareth in these words: Senum temperies sicca est, pro 
exemplo sunt arbores, Na~ quoties senescunt magis exiccantur. 
 
We see also that the earth in Haruest time being ouer 
dried and parched with the heate of the Sommers 
Sunne, cannot so speedily suck and drinke vp such sudden 
showres of raine, as at that time most vsually doo 
happen. 
 
And therefore about that time of the yeare we see 
the greatest land flouds to appeare, and most harmes 
to happen to men by losse of their Hey carried away 
thereby. 
 
All which proceedeth by reason of the great siccetie 
and dri'th of the earth at that season, causing it to be far 
vnapt to receiue that sudden moisture flowing on the 
face thereof. 
 
In like case the firme and sollide parts of mans body, 
being ouer drie and hardned by the long and continuall 
vse of Tabacco, do with the more difficultie receiue 
and imbybe into them the alimentall humiditie 
before specified: and therfore they remaine more copious 
in the body. 
 
[}The sixt Reason.}] 
 
THe sixt Reason against Tabacco was, 
that this Plant seemeth not voyd of suspition 
of a venemous and poysoned nature, 
and therefore ought not so carelesly 
or confidenly to be vsed. 
 
[^f.E3v^] 
The venemous and poisoned substance and nature 
of Tabacco, is manifested and prooued by this, that it 
is daily experimented, and before was prooued by vs, 
to be a violent and most forceable purge. 
 
[/28./] 
Galen in his second booke De ratione virtus, and 12. 
Section, holdeth for a certaintie that all vehement and 
violent purges, haue in them some deliterious & poysoned 
nature, & a facultie or operation cleane contrary 
to the nature of man. 
 
And in the sixt of his Epidenickes, the same Galen 
affirmeth, that in times past purging medicines were 
esteemed deliterious, for that they (being taken in any 
large quantitie) were offensiue to nature, destroying 
and wasting the same. 
 
In good Authors I finde three kinds of deliterious 
[/29./] 
medicines. The one in manifest qualitie, either excessiue 
hote, as Calcanthum, or else extreame cold (as Mandrake) 
or Opium. 
 
[/30./] 
Of the second sort, are those which by their owne 
poysoned nature and substance, be deadly offensiue to 
the takers therof, and they being receiued but in small 
dose or quantitie, kill and poyson the takers thereof. 
Such are venemous musrumps, Napellum, Taxicum, 
and such like. 
 
[/31./] 
Of the third kind of deliterious and deadly medicines, 
be such, as are by reason of their veheme~t & violent 
euacuation, most daungerous and perillous, if in 
any large quantitie they be assumed. Such be Enphorbium, 
Præcipitate, Eleterium, and Tabacco it selfe. 
 
Which last as it is deliterious by violent euacuation, So 
it is also very pernicious and hurtfull in his manifest and 
euident qualities of extreame dry'th and heate included 
therein. 
 
But touching his violent euacuation and purging 
qualitie, it hath bene sufficiently shewed before. This 
[^f.E4r^] 
one thing may be added therevnto, that Tabacco is in 
this respect more perillous, for that it is taken without 
due preparation and correction. 
 
For it is confessed of all Phisitians, that euery purging 
[/32./] 
medicine if it be strong (in respect of the deliterious 
& bad qualitie it hath) ought to be artificially corrected 
before it be take~, least he communicate his bad 
and venemous nature, to the stomack & inward parts. 
 
Herevpon it is a vsuall custome in Phisicke, to mixe 
with purges, Mastich, Cloues, Cinamome, Ginger, 
Aniseeds, Nutmegs, and such like sweete and aramaticall 
Spices, partly to take away the vngratefull sent of 
the purge, and partly to defend the vitall spirits, & principall 
parts, from the malice and hurt which otherwise 
would happen by the ill qualitie of the purge. 
 
Out of this rule of preparation of purges, onely 
Aloes Succotrine is by Mesnes excepted. Which as hee affirmeth 
is so farre from ill qualitie and deliterious nature, 
as that it is commonly giuen with other purges to 
amend & correct their venemous & malitious nature. 
 
But what correctiues I pray you in our time and 
Countrey are there vsed in this Indian Tabacco, which 
the more simple & sincere it is, the more holsome and 
effectuall it is adiudged to be? And if it haue by any 
meanes any aramaticall spices shufled amongst it, it is 
straight reiected and condemned for naught & counterfeit. 
 
I denie not but that since Hippocratus and Mesnes 
time, there haue beene found out sundrie purges by 
the latter Arabians, which for that they worke gently 
and without offence, are called of them, Benedicta Medicamenta: 
Blessed and safe medicines, and therefore 
[^f.E4v^] 
haue need of no preparation to be vsed with them for 
their correction. Such are thought to be Manna of Calabria, 
Camarinds, Cassia of Rhubarbe. But this Tabacco 
(now in vse) is of an other keye, and no waies to be accounted 
Benedictum in working, but rather diabolicall 
and hellish: for that it worketh with extremitie, torments 
and griefe. 
 
[/33./] 
And that it is also in substance and nature deliterious 
and venemous, may be gathered by the symtomes 
and accidents which doo immediately follow and ensue 
the large drinking therof. That are, violent vomits, 
many and infinite stooles, great gnawings and torments 
in the guts and inward parts. Coldnesse in the 
outward and externall members, Crampes, Convultions, 
cold sweats, ill colour, and wannesse of skinne, 
defect of feeling, sence, & vnderstanding, losse of sight, 
giddinesse of the head and braine, profound and deep 
sleepe, faintnesse, soundings, and to some hastie and 
vntimely death. All which, or the most part of them 
concurring, do manifest a poisoned qualitie or venemous 
nature in the thing receiued. 
 
[/34./] 
And it is the more daungerous for that it hath in it 
the effects of contrary and repuguant poisons: for albeit 
it be in qualitie very hotte & drie, yet hath it a stupifying 
and benumming effect, not much vnlike to 
Opium or Henbane: which ere held to be colde in the 
extreamest degree. And albeit, it be apt to suffocate or 
strangle like to Gipsum or playster of Parrise, yet doth 
it purge & scoure as violently as Precipatate or Quicksiluer 
sublymed. 
 
I cannot resemble the poysoned force of this Tabacco 
to any thing more aptly, then to the venome of a 
[^f.F1r^] 
[/35./] 
Scorpion, which neuer receiueth cure but from the 
Scorpion it selfe, bruised or annointed on the place 
stung. In like case the venemous impression left in the 
stomacke by Tabacco, receiueth no ease by any thing 
else whatsoeuer, but by Tabacco onely, eftsoone reiterated 
and resumed. This onely difference seemeth to 
be betweene these two poysons, That the venome of 
the Scorpion hath his perfect and absolute cure from 
the Scorpion it selfe, but that of Tabacco hath onely a 
certaine ease and paliation for a time by the fume of 
Tabacco receiued; but after perfect and absolute cure, 
this Tabacco by it selfe a thousand times resumed or reiterated, 
admitteth none. 
 
[/36./] 
Neither do I take it of great importance which is by 
some alleaged; That many here in England do take the 
fume of Tabacco without hurt or inconuenience, and 
without any such strange accidents following. For the 
custome of taking Tabacco with vs, is in that maner, as 
that, it neither profiteth, nor yet hurteth much. 
 
[/37./] 
For what great inconuenience (I pray you) can 
happen to the taker thereof, when as he receiuing it at 
the mouth, doth straightway puffe it forth againe, or 
snuffeth it out at his nostrels, before it can haue sufficient 
time and space, to imprint his malicious and venemous 
qualitie in their bodies? 
 
[/38./] 
Fewe or none do take it downe their throates, and 
such as let it passe down, they mince it in such sort, and 
swallow it in so small quantitie, as that no great detriment 
can happen to them thereby. 
 
But if happily any, more audacious then circumspect, 
shall let downe any large quantitie thereof, then 
shal you euidently perceiue in him, most of those accidents 
[^f.F1v^] 
before specified. 
 
I am not ignorant that many perillous and deadly 
poysons are sometimes taken into the body without 
offence and daunger, but then they are either in very 
[/39./] 
small quantitie (as I spake before) or else so repressed 
and corrected with other Cordialls, as that they cannot 
offend, but sometimes they bring great commoditie 
and profit with them. 
 
For example, the flesh of Vipers in Treacle is so tempered 
and corrected, that it profiteth much to such as orderly reciue 
it, against any poyson or contagion whatsoeuer. And 
quick-siluer well mortified, is often giuen, & inwardly 
taken, against many infirmities, with good successe. 
 
So in like maner we denie not but that in smal quantitie 
Tabacco may be taken of any man without peril or 
imminent danger, & especially being corrected & purified 
by the force of the fire wherewith it is ministred. 
 
[/40./] 
For that fire sometimes doth represse the poisoned 
vapour of venemous things, may be prooued by the 
testimony of Seneca, who (in his 2. booke of his natural 
[/41./] 
questions, and 31. Chapter, going about to shewe the 
reason why that poisoned and venemous beasts do neuer 
engender wormes within them, vntill such time as 
they be first striken with lightning) saith, that wormes 
are engendred of humours apt to receiue life. But 
such be farre differing from such as are of a venemous 
or poisoned disposition or nature, for they are altogether 
aduersaries and enemies to life. This poisoned 
and venemous nature in Serpents (once striken with 
lightning) is in them wasted, dissipated & dispearced, 
by meanes of the fire in the lightning, and the humors 
remaining after in them, beeing freed fro~ venome and 
[^f.F2r^] 
poison, may the more aptly be conuerted into things 
bearing life, and to wormes themselues. 
 
It may also be assigned out of Mercurialis for an other 
[/42./] 
reason, why wormes are not engendered in poisoned 
serpents, because that wormes haue their originall 
from vndigested and crudie humours in the body: But 
Serpents haue no such in them: for all their humours be well 
and perfectly digested. Which may well bee gathered by 
the fragrant and sweete smell, and pleasant smell and 
sent, which breathing from their bodies, is left behind 
in those places where they vsually haunt. 
 
But here may be obiected, that if Tabacco were of 
[/43./] 
that poysoned nature (as wee haue affirmed) then no 
doubt, the Indians (who vsually drinke it) should haue 
long since bin poisoned therewith. But hitherto they 
haue found no such hurt, but rather great commoditie 
and manifest benefit thereby. As appeareth by Monardus 
in his Treatise of Tabacco. 
 
To this may be answered, that the oddes and diuersitie 
[/44./] 
of their bodies and humours from ours, may alter 
much the case. Or else, that long custome and familiar 
vse of this Tabacco from their infancie, hath confirmed 
their bodies, to suffer & endure the same without hurt 
or offence: for custome altereth nature. 
 
In like case I read in Galen in his 3. booke of simples, 
[/45./] 
and 18. Chap. of a certain old woman that nourished 
her selfe long season with poisoned Hemlockes By litle 
and litle (saith he) shee accustomed nature thereto, that at 
length, this poyson became familiar to her, and no way offensiue, 
but rather nourishing to her body. 
 
Auicen also in his Treatise de Viribus Cordis, alleaging 
Rufus an auncient Phisitian for his authour, reporteth 
[^f.F2v^] 
that there was a yong maid, who being fed & norished 
long time with poyson, liued her self in perfect health. 
And yet with her venemous breath she poysoned and 
infected all other persons that came neare to the same. 
 
[/46./] 
Plynie in his 7. booke & 2. chap. of his naturall history. 
And Aulus Gellius, noct attic. 16. cap. II. And Siluius 
Italicus in 8. lib. doo all testifie that in times past there 
were certain people in Italy (Marsitians by name) who 
vsually handled and sold, yea and fed on also the flesh 
of Vipers. Which of all Serpents are accounted most 
malignant and venemous. 
 
[/47./] 
And Virgil in his 7. Aeneid. faineth those people to 
be the ofspring of Circes, and that they had a naturall 
gift giuen them by her, to tame & enchaunt that kind 
of Serpent: and also to qualifie & delay the venemous 
and poysoned nature thereof. 
 
[/48./] 
Of these men Galen maketh mentio~ in his II. booke 
of simple medicines, where he co~fesseth, that being at 
Rome, he inquired diligently of those people (tearmed 
Marsi) of the nature & qualitie of vipers, and how they 
differed from the other Serpent called Dipsas. Because 
(saith he) they were expert and cunning in them. 
 
[/49./] 
So that it is manifest & apparant by the testimonies 
before rehearsed, that custome may alter & change nature 
and the qualitie of things, according to that vsuall 
Co~suetudo alter at natura~. Custom changeth nature, & at 
le~gth turneth into nature it self; for it is an other nature. 
 
The like is seene in the East Indies, where the Turkes 
familiarly vse Opium in large quantitie, which to vs but 
in very small dose is experimented to be manifest poyson: 
onely long vse & familiar practise hath made this 
vnconuenient for their bodies. 
 
[^f.F3r^] 
And so no doubt if our countrey men from their 
infancie had by litle and litle vsed to take this Tabacco 
fume or other poyson whatsoeuer, they should haue 
had as litle cause to feare the daunger thereof, as the 
Turkes haue of their Opium, or the old Marsitians had 
of Vipers, or the West Indians haue of their Tabacco. 
But for want of that Custome, it fareth with vs in that 
sort, that if we take any great quantitie of the Opium 
before specified, we shall rather die on the sudden, or 
else fall into that kinde of dead sleepe, as that we shall 
by no other meanes then by the Arch-angels trumpet 
(sounding at the latter day) be awakened thereout. 
 
To this may be added a secret vertue and specificall 
qualitie giuen the Indians by nature, whereby they 
are not ouercome by this kinde of poyson, as other 
Nations be. For Sextus Empericus reporteth in the like 
[/50./] 
case, that one Attienagoras Argivus had a gift giuen by 
nature euen from his birth, that hee could bee hurt by 
no venemous Beast or Serpent whatsoeuer. And that 
certaine people of Aethiopia did naturally feed & nourish 
themselues with the flesh of Scorpions. 
 
But we Englishme~ may not safely presume that this 
specificall vertue & hidden qualitie doth abide or lurk 
in vs, seeing that by far weaker poisons then these, we 
sustaine infinit perils, and often incurre death it selfe. 
 
Wherefore we haue the lesse cause to venture on 
things in reason suspected to be of a venemous & poysoned 
qualitie, because forsoothe the Indians doo it 
without offence. 
 
Neither is it of any great waight or moment which 
is alleadged of the Tabacco patrons for her commendation, 
that Marriners and Sea-faring men, neuer 
[^f.F3v^] 
found any remedie so forceable against the Scuruie 
and other diseases of like nature, commonly incident 
to that kinde of people (by meanes of the foggy ayre 
in the Sea, and their vnholsome diet) then is the fume 
of Tabacco. 
 
The reason of this profit in Marriners may bee, 
because their bodies after long lying on the Seas, are 
filled and stuffed with badde and corrupt humours, 
on the which the force and power of Tabacco dooth 
worke, drawing and purging them forth of the body, 
no otherwise then other strong purges expell and 
purge forth such corrupt humours as haue any similitude 
or likenesse to themselues. 
 
But as strong purges taken of sound and holsome 
bodies (as I shewed you before) be very perillous and 
dangerous: So truly is Tabacco, being taken of such as 
are cleare and voyd of such impure and corrupt matter, 
which to the Marriners is most familiar and 
vsuall. 
 
The like is seene of other poysons, which when 
they find any of their owne qualitie & nature in mans 
body, or that hath any likenesse or similitude to them, 
they drawe forth the same (the like couering his like) 
and leaue the sound and healthy humours cleare and 
vnspotted. 
 
But when no such poisoned matter is found in the 
bodie, then dooth the poyson or venome receiued, 
worke on the good humours, vtterly corrupting and 
destroying them. So that it is apparant that sometime 
venomes (to venemous and poysoned persons) may 
be profitable & medicinable. But to sound & healthy 
[^f.F4r^] 
bodies they can neuer happen without danger. 
 
[}The seuenth Reason.}] 
 
THe seuenth reason against Tabacco 
was, that this hearbe seemed to bee 
first found out and inuented by the 
diuell, and first vsed and practised by 
the diuels priests, and therfore not to 
be vsed of vs Christians. 
 
That the diuell was the first author 
hereof, Monardus in his Treatise of Tabacco dooth 
sufficiently witnesse, saying. The Indian Priests (who 
no doubt were instruments of the diuell whom they 
serue) doo euer before they answere to questions propounded 
to them by their Princes, drinke of this Tabacco 
fume, with the vigour and strength wherof, they 
fall suddenly to the ground, as dead men, remaining 
so, according to the quantitie of the smoake that they 
had taken. And when the hearbe had done his 
worke, they reuiue and wake, giuing answeres according 
to the visions and illusions which they saw whilst 
they were wrapt in that order. 
 
And they interpreted their demaunds as to them 
seemed best, or as the diuell had counselled them, giuing 
co~tinual doubtful answers, in such sort, that howsoeuer 
they fell out, they might turne it to their purpose, 
like vnto the Oracle of Apollo. As 
 
Aio te Æacide Romanos vincere posse. 
 
Which might be vnderstood, that either he might 
ouerthrow the Romanes, or that the Romanes might 
ouercome him. 
 
[^f.F4v^] 
But yet in more plaine words, the same Monardus a 
litle after declareth the Diuell to bee the author of 
Tabacco, and of the knowledge thereof, saying: And 
as the Diuell is a deceiuer, and hath the knowledge 
of the vertue of hearbes; so hee did shewe them the 
vertue of this hearbe, by meanes whereof they might 
see the imaginations and Visions that hee representeth 
vnto them, and by that meanes dooth deceiue 
them. 
 
Wherfore in mine opinion this practise is the more 
to be eschued of vs Christians, who follow & professe 
Christ as the onely veritie and truth, and detest and abhorre 
the diuell, as a lyar and deceiuer of mankinde. 
 
[}The eight and last Reason.}] 
 
THe last, and that not the least argument 
against Tabacco, was that it is a 
great encreaser of melancholy in vs, 
and thereby disposeth our bodies to 
all melancholy impressions and effects 
proceeding of that humour. 
 
[/51./] 
Galen in his second booke of temperaments 
and 3. Chapter, defineth Melancholy to 
be the very sediment and dregges of bloud; which is 
so farre thicker & colder then bloud, as yeallow choller 
is held to be thinner and hotter then the same. 
 
And this melancholy humour is said to bee of two 
sorts; the one naturall, the other vnnaturall. 
 
The naturall is that thicke part of the bloud before 
rehearsed. The vnnaturall is not the sediment or 
[^f.G1r^] 
grounds of good bloud, but rather a certain burnt and 
parched matter rising of the adustian and scorching of 
the other humors, that is, of phlegme, yealow choller, 
and of the former sediment of pure bloud, which we 
termed naturall melancholy. 
 
And albeit it seemeth very vnlike that phlegme (being 
of nature cold and moist) may by any adustian be 
turned into swoart and blacke choller; yet in qualitie 
and disposition that humour doth often represent and 
resemble melancholy it selfe. And therefore Galen holdeth 
sometimes melancholy to bee ingendered of 
phlegmy ouer-hardned and dried. 
 
The contrarietie and diuersitie of these vnnaturall 
melancholies, doth hang and depend on the contrarietie 
and difference of the humours whereof they bee 
engendered. 
 
All these sorts of melancholies are augmented and 
encreased much in such as often accustome themselues 
to the fume of Tabacco. 
 
For first, touching the natural melancholy, it is manifest 
that the thicker and grosser that the bloud is, the 
more of that thicke and earthly sediment it shall containe. 
But Tabacco thickeneth and engrosseth the 
bloud, and therefore Tabacco engendereth in vs a 
greater store of that thicke and grosse sediment which 
wee defined to bee of Galen called naturall melancholy. 
 
The Maior or first Proposition is manifest, for all 
liquid and moist things are the more thicke, or thinne, 
and cleare, according to the quantitie of the grounds 
and feces mixed in the same. For if the groundes 
[^f.G1v^] 
be many, then is the matter or humor troublesome 
and thicke. But if the dregges or feces be fewe, then 
is the humor cleare and thin. 
 
The Minor or second Proposition of the former 
Sillogisme, may be proued in this sort. All those things 
which waste and consume the purest & thinnest parts 
of the blood, doo cause the same blood to remaine afterward 
more grosse and thicke, and therfore may iustly 
be said to thicken the blood. 
 
But Tabacco wasteth and absumeth the liquid and 
thin part of our blood, and therfore Tabacco may iustly 
be said to thicken the same. The Maior Proposition 
being euident, needeth no farther proofe. 
 
The Minor is prooued by daily and vsuall practise 
and experience of such as commonly doo drinke this 
Tabacco. For thereby doo they purge great store of a 
cleare and thin humour, which would mixe it selfe 
with the blood, and cause the same to be more liquid 
and fluent, and in time also (by good Concoction) 
turne into pure and subtile blood, apt to feede and norish 
the bodie. 
 
And albeit melancholy (being of nature cold) seemeth 
to haue no need of phlegmetique and thin humours 
to be mixed therewith (least that his colde distemper 
be greatly increased thereby): yet of necessitie 
some store of this crude and raw matter is required 
to runne with the melancholy Iuice, to moderate 
and temper his extreame siccetie and drythe, and to 
defend it from Induration & hardnesse. The increase 
whereof in our bodies, breedeth dulnesse, sottishnesse, 
and blockishnesse. All which are the vsuall effects of 
[^f.G2r^] 
ouer-hardened and dryed melancholie. 
 
For melancholy ouer hardened, if it come once 
to be cooled, it is extreame cold as Iron. Which being 
heat, is extreame hotte; and being cooled againe, 
is extreame cold also. 
 
So this hard and drie melancholy once depriued 
of naturall heate by the inordinate vse of Tabacco 
fewme (the fierie heate of the one dissipating the naturall 
and lesser heate of the other) can yeeld nothing 
else but the effects of an excessiue and immoderate 
colde cause lying in the veines, and mixed with the 
blood. Such are esteemed to bee dulnesse of conceit, 
blockishnesse, mopishnesse, and sottishnesse, one 
of the worst kindes of accidents that commonly ensue 
ouer-hardened, cooled and dryed melancholy in our 
bodies. 
 
Againe, such as the partes of the blood be, such 
also is thought the blood to bee, and as the blood 
prooueth, so likewise are the spirites affected, for they 
doo issue and proceed from the blood it selfe. And 
such as the spirites are, such also is adiudged to be the 
temper and dissipation of the heart and braine: and 
as the braine is disposed and affected, so likewise are 
the vertues of conceit, imagination, vnderstanding, 
and remembrance, affected and disposed also. All 
which in particular, by sundrie examples were easie 
to prooue, for him that is but meanely seene and slenderly 
read in Philosophie sayings, that the sanguine 
man by meanes of the puritie of his blood, hath his 
braine and inward parts well tempered, his sences 
cleare, his spirites light and subtile, his heart bold and 
[^f.G2v^] 
merrie, his minde affable, curteous and ciuil. Whereas 
on the contrary part, the melancholy person by reason 
of the superfluous earthly and drie matter mixed 
with his bloud, hath his complexion more wan and 
swarte, his conceit of braine more dull and hard, his 
minde giuen to sollitarinesse and priuate life. For 
those two humours of bloud and melancholy, are in 
both their qualities very repugnant and contrary. 
The one beeing hotte and moyst, the other colde 
and drie. 
 
But here me thinkes I heare you say, what maketh 
this Idle discourse of bloud and melancholy, of the 
disposition of the braine and spirits to your purpose, 
or to the reputation of Tabacco? 
 
Forsoothe very much. For heereby it appeareth 
that the continuall practises of Tabacco, destroy the puritie 
and clearenesse of their bloud, in that as I prooued 
before, it hardeneth and thickeneth the same. 
And in thickening it engendereth dull & melancholy 
spirites, which make blockish and sottish conceits, 
and a timerous and deiected mind not fit or conuenient 
for man that delighteth in ciuilitie and societie of 
others. For seeing that the fewme of Tabacco yeeldeth 
no good foode or nourishment to the pure blood, but 
rather troubleth and corrupteth the same, it is thereby 
most plaine and euident, that it ingendreth in vs most 
dull and troubled spirites, also tasting and sauouring 
much of that loathsome fewme and duskish smoake 
which riseth & steemeth vp to the braine by the roofe 
and pallate of the mouth, first sent thither through the 
Tabacco pipe full charged with Tabacco dust, and afterward 
[^f.G3r^] 
scorched and incinerated by the extreame heate 
of the parching fire. 
 
This darke and smoakie fume, pearsing the cauities 
and ventricles of the braine, no otherwise, then a melancholy 
winde or adust vapour (rising from an adust 
Liuer, or obstructed splene) do breed in vs terror, and 
feare, discontentment of life, false and peruerse imaginations, 
and fantasies most strange, no way depending 
vpon iust cause or grounds, and alwaies a melancholy 
spirit, a fearfull and timerous minde. For truly the inward 
darknesse and obscuritie of the braine, doth appall 
and terrifie our inward sences and minde also, in 
no lesse sort then doth the externall darknesse or myst 
of the outward aire, terrifie & appall the same. 
 
And if any man be so farre blinded with Tabacco, 
that he will not admit for true, that the vapor or fume 
thereof ascending to the braine, is darke and swart of 
colour, and of qualitie excessiue drie; let him but cast 
his eyes on the smoake issuing forth of the nosthrils of 
the Tabacconists, or to the smoakie tincture left in the 
Tabacco Pipe after the receit thereof, and he shall easily 
reclaime his error. This swart & sottish tincture cleaueth 
so fast to the inward part of the Pipe, as hardly by 
any meanes but by the extreme heate of the fire it may 
be cleared from thence. And no doubt the like impression 
doth the same leaue in our braines, and in the 
cauities thereof. So that the animall spirits ingendred 
in those places, can no lesse but (participating thereof) 
sauour of the same, no otherwise then wine put into 
an vnsauorie and mustie bottle, doth euer sauour of a 
mustie taste. 
 
[^f.G3v^] 
Neither am I any waies ignorant that Aristotle in 
his Problems holdeth that melancholy doth help and 
profit much to the sharpening & quickning of the wit 
and vnderstanding: and that melancholy persons are 
deemed of him the most wisest. But this kinde of melancholy 
(which Aristotle talketh of) is altogether naturall, 
and no way engendreth of the Tabacco smoake. 
For it is the sediment and groundes of the pure & perfect 
[/52./] 
blood, in colour like golde, or somewhat inclining 
to purple: litle in quantitie, and somewhat shining. 
The spirits which issue from this kinde of melancholy, 
are verie light, fine and subtile, not much vnlike to the 
spirits of wine well distilled, and artificially rectified: 
which is by art and force of the fire drawne out of the 
feces or grounds of pure wine. And the spirits rising 
from this drie melancholy humor, are the thinner and 
the more subtile by reason of the closenesse & straightnesse 
of the pores of the same matter: and they are the 
more firme & constant in their action, by meanes that 
they issue and proceed from an humor more compacted 
and close vnited. 
 
The subtilitie therefore and stabilitie of these spirites, 
rising from such a naturall melancholy, doeth 
much further the sharpning of the wit and vnderstanding 
of man. 
 
But the like cannot be expected of the spirites rising 
of that kinde of melancholy which is engendred 
by the abuse of Tabacco. For this sort of melancholy 
humor is neither bright & shining like to molten gold, 
nor yet the grounds of pure and perfect blood, but rather 
an earthly and adust matter, not much vnlike 
[^f.G4r^] 
stoncole or scorched earth. So that the spirites issuing 
from it must needs be of a diuers and farre contrarie 
qualitie and nature. 
 
Last of all, melancholy being of nature cold and 
drie, had in reason need of some thin and liquid humor 
to be mixed therewith, to temper his extreame 
siccetie and drythe: which is the qualitie of most offence 
and annoyance in it. For as phlegme offendeth 
most in cold, so doth melancholy falt most in drynesse. 
 
Tabacco therefore ought in no respect to be familiarly 
vsed of the melancholy person, because it is excessiue 
drie, both in his manifest qualitie, and likewise by 
accidentall meanes of his immoderate purging and 
euacuation, by meanes whereof, great part of that liquid 
and moyst matter is purged out of the body that 
should retaine and keepe it in perfect state and temper. 
And for that Tabacco is confessed to be hotte, almost in 
the third degree of excesse, therfore his drithe and siccetie 
is thereby made the more vehement, and vntollerable. 
 
So that it is apparant that vnnaturall melancholy, 
whether it be made of adustian of bloud, choller, or 
phlegmy, or else of the sediment of them, scorched 
and as it were incinerated, hath no small encrease by 
the vntimely vse of this phantasticall deuice of Tabacco 
smoake, leauing in our bodies a fierie impression and 
drie distemper, not easily remedied. 
 
And therefore in my opinion all melancholy persons, 
of what state or condition soeuer they bee of; and 
especially Students and Schollers, ought to bee very 
[^f.G4v^] 
well aduised in the vse of so pernitious and dangerous 
a thing, least that in them, naturall melancholy be conuerted 
into vnnaturall, and this also, either into a corrisiue 
and adust humour apt to inflame the braine, or 
else into a matter to hard and drie, as that it be altogether 
hurtful and offensiue to the vnctuous and radicall 
moisture of the life of man: and thereby occasion a 
hastie and vntimely death. For no longer can life continue, 
then naturall heate bee refreshed with an ayrie 
and moderate moisture included in the radicall 
humour, and appointed by nature for 
the reliefe and sustentation 
of the same.
