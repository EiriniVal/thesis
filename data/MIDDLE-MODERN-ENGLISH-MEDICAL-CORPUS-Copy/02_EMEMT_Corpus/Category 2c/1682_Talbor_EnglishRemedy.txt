[}THE 
ENGLISH REMEDY: 
OR, 
TALBOR's 
WONDERFUL SECRET.}] 
 
QVinquina, or Kinakina, 
is the Bark of an Indian 
Tree, of the bigness 
of a Cherry-Tree, 
whose leaves much resemble the 
leaves of a young Oak, and beareth 
a fruit not unlike to an Acorn, 
the figure thereof given by 
Johnstonus may be seen at the end 
of the History of Trees written by 
Mantissa. 
 
[^p.2^] 
It is hardly as yet thirty years 
since this Drug became known in 
Europe: since that time many Authors 
have wrote of it, as Johnstonus, 
James Chifflet, Denis Touquet, 
in his Royal Garden of Plants; 
Roland Sturmius, Melipus, Conigius, 
Gaudentius, Brunatius, Wolfangus, 
Hœferus, Willis, Rolfincius, 
a Physitian of Leyden that 
hath added to Scroderus, M. de 
Muve, in his Pharmaceutick Dictionary, 
the Author of the Treatise 
of the Cure of Feavers, &c. 
And last of all Mr. Lemery in 
the fourth Edition of his Course of 
Chymistry: several other curious 
Remarks are to be found in our 
Journals of Medicine upon the 
same subject. 
 
[^p.3^] 
These Authors do not all agree 
upon the Etimology of its name, 
nor upon the place from whence 
it is brought; for some affirm that 
it comes from China, and therefore 
many have called it Cortex sineasis, 
and to distinguish it from that 
Root which is called China or Kina, 
they have named it Quinquina, 
or (which is the same thing) 
Kina-kina: others again who are 
more in number, maintain that 
it is brought from Peru, where 
the Feaver or Ague is called Quina, 
whence comes the name Quinquina; 
That the Natives of that 
Countrey call it Gannateride; that 
because of its extraction it ought 
to be called in Latin, Cortex Peruviana, 
and in the vulgar Language 
the Bark of Peru, and that 
[^p.4^] 
the name of Jesuits Powder by 
which it commonly goes, was 
given it, because the Jesuits were 
the first that brought it from America, 
of which Peru is a part. 
However the matter be, they 
begin now to call it in Latin, Cortex 
febrilis; and the Spaniards 
name it, Palo de Culenturas, i.e. 
Feaver-wood. 
 
The reason why it was thought 
to come from China, was because 
much of it was brought from 
Portugal, but that makes nothing 
against the common opinion, because 
it is known that the Portugueze 
have Commerce with both 
Indies. 
 
Some Authors make two kinds 
of Quinquina, one which they 
say is wild and of little value, 
[^p.5^] 
and another which they think is 
cultivated, and therefore say that 
it is better of the two; but 
to make a true estimate of their 
quality, it were fit one should 
be upon the place where they 
grow. 
 
It is certain nevertheless that 
the goodness of it may be known 
by some marks which experience 
hath discovered; for the best 
hath always its upper rind or skin 
cut transversally or crossways 
with pretty deep streaks or lines, 
and long-ways withv ery superficial 
ones when it is fresh, and now 
the most part of the little squares 
or interstices of its skin, are of 
a silver white colour; it is otherways 
of a clear reddish colour, 
compact, very bitter, and gives to 
[^p.6^] 
the boxes wherein it is kept a 
sweet and pleasant smell. 
 
But it is to be observed that 
that smell is much weaker and 
less aromatick than the scent of 
Cassia Cariophilata, which by 
cheats is Sold for Quinquina, mingling 
it with the bark of Cherry-Tree, 
which for some days before 
they have steept in Water 
wherein Aloes hath been dissolved; 
and this is a very culpable 
sophistication, seeing these kinds 
of barks have nothing of the virtue 
of Quinquina. 
 
There is besides this, another 
way of cheating the Publick as to 
the matter of the Jesuits Powder 
for there are some Droguists that 
infuse it entire, and having by 
that means extracted the first 
[^p.7^] 
Tincture out of it, for their own 
advantage, sell it afterward at 
the same rate as if it had not lost 
his chief virtue. 
 
Hitherto the price of Quinquina 
or Jesuits Powder, hath been very 
various and uncertain. When it 
was only in the hands of the Jesuits, 
it was sold at Rome and Paris 
for Eight or Nine Shillings 
Sterling the Dose, which consisted 
only of Two Drachms; but so 
soon as Droguists began to Trade 
in it, it began to fall in Price, so 
that Three or Four Years ago, 
the best might have been had for 
about Forty Shillings the Pound 
weight; but no sooner began the 
English Remedy to be in vogue, 
but men began every where to 
make Experiments with the Bark 
[^p.8^] 
of Peru, which much enhansed 
the value of it: yet that was not 
all which raised it to the highest 
price; for Sir Robert Talbot observing 
that Febrifuges were prepar'd 
which came very near his 
own, and fearing least some body 
at length might discover it, resolved 
to buy up all the Quinquina, 
that he could find at Paris, 
and the other chief Towns of 
France, and of England also. The 
execution of this Design making 
some noise, several Physitians, 
Chirurgeons and Apothecaries, 
thought it concerned them, to 
make all hast to provide themselves; 
and some that they might 
not be wanting in Precaution, 
caused a considerable quantity 
of the Bark to be brought from 
[^p.9^] 
Roan and Bourdeaux, so that 
Mr. Audry and Mr. Vilain, the 
two most famous Droguists in 
Paris, having Sold all they had 
at the Rate of about Fifteen 
Pound the pound-weight; and 
not being able to procure any 
more from any place, for above 
a Fortnight there was not 
a bit to be had at any Droguist's 
shop in Paris, nevertheless some 
small quantity came at length, 
but it was held up so dear, that 
it was like to have gone off at 
the rate of an Hundred Crowns 
the pound-weight: since that 
time the Merchants having imported 
much from Spain and 
Portugal, and the English Remedy 
having lost the Advantages 
of the Mode; the price of that 
[^p.10^] 
Commodity hath fallen daily, in 
so much that at preset it does 
not yield above Four or Five 
Pound the pound-weight; and I 
make no doubt, but that in a 
short time a Fleet from the 
West-Indies will make it much 
cheaper. 
 
Amongs the Authors whom 
I have named, there are some 
who endeavouring to explain 
the properties of Quinquina or 
the Jesuits Powder, according to 
the principles of the ancient 
Medicine, think it enough to say 
that it is hot and dry in the beginning 
of the Second Degree: 
and some others of the number 
of those who have introduced 
bad Principles into the New-Philosophy, 
think to mend the 
[^p.11^] 
matter by saying, That Quinquina 
as an Alkali stops the motion 
of the acid which occasions 
the Feaver: but that is to illustrate 
one obscurity by others 
that are far more obscure. 
 
That we may give the World 
somewhat more satisfactory as 
to that point, we must in the 
first place, (with Willis,) take 
our measures from Experience, 
and allow with him, That all 
things which are actually bitter, 
have great virtue in sifting preternatural 
fermentations; and 
upon that account it was that 
the Root of Gentian was heretofore 
in so great reputation for 
curing of Quartan Agues; and 
that the Flowers of the lesser 
Centaury, the Root of Contrayerva, 
[^p.12^] 
and Serpentaria, the leaves 
of Wormwood and Chervil, Scammony, 
and many other bitter 
Drogues, are really Febrifuges, 
though in virtue far inferior to the 
Jesuits Powder. 
 
Having laid down this from 
undoubted Truth, we must now 
enquire into the Natural Causes 
which produce Bitterness in 
mixt bodies; now supposing (as 
it is reasonable we should) that 
the true, Elements of Bodies are 
acid, liquid, fiery, etherean, and 
terrestrial corpuscles; it will be 
a very easie matter to discover 
those Causes; for seeing all bitter 
things penetrate the Tongue, in 
such a manner that they leave 
therein a sense of their action for 
a long time after, and that of 
[^p.13^] 
all the elements none are so proper 
as acids to produce that 
effect, we must conclude that 
they are predominant in mixts 
which have that tast; but also 
since being mingled with many 
liquid corpuscles, they produce 
only sharp and corroding liquors, 
as the spirits of Salt, Vitriol, Alum, 
&c. that being joyned to 
fiery corpuscles, they make only 
Causticks, as corrosive sublimat; 
the spirit of Nitre, cauteres, &c. 
and that being in intimate conjunction 
with Sulphurous and 
Oily Particles, they only produce 
sweet mixts, as Honey, Sugar, &c. 
It follows that none but terrestrial 
corpuscles mingled with 
them in a proportionable quantity, 
can produce a bitter tast, 
[^p.14^] [^Original misnumbered as p.15.^] 
and in effect the more of Earth 
there is in Salt, the bitterer it is, 
and on the contrary, the more 
it is refined and depurated, the 
less bitter it is: thus Sea Salt 
dissolved in a moist Air, and 
afterward filtrated through 
brown paper, has no other tast 
than of an acid spirit, though 
before that dissolution and filtration 
it was considerably bitter. 
 
Now since among the Elements 
that I have named, the 
acid is heaviest, and by consequence 
the coldest; and that 
though the terrestrial be not so 
heavy as it, nor yet as the liquid, 
yet it is more ponderous than 
the fiery and ethereal, we may 
say that it is temperat; I mean, 
of a quality equally distant from 
[^p.15^] 
the two extreams, and that so, 
being with the acid predominant 
in a mixt body, the mixt must 
certainly be cooling, or at least 
proper to preserve the just temperament 
of our body. 
 
But because there are no bitter 
things made up solely of acid 
and terrestrial corpuscles, and 
that there are some wherein either 
the fiery, the ethereal or 
liquid particles are likewise in a 
considerable quantity; so there 
are some more or less bitter, and 
even more or less cooling and 
temperate; but if we mind the 
dryness of Quinquina, and yet 
how unapt it is to take fire, it 
will not be hard to conclude, 
That the three Elements which I 
have named last, enter but in a 
[^p.16^] 
very small quantity into the 
composition thereof, and that 
by consequence amongst all bittter 
mixts none can be of a more 
temperate quality than it. 
 
From the Principle which I 
have now laid down concerning 
the nature of Quinquina, all the 
other properties thereof may be 
deduced; for seeing its predominant 
parts are the acids, whose 
property is to coagulate the 
more substantial liquors, such 
as Blood, Milk, &c. and the terrestrial 
which by absorbing the 
humidity and unctuosity that relaxates 
the solid parts, does bind 
and strengthen them; of necessity 
it must be stiptick and astringent, 
and it is in effect in these 
two qualities principally, that the 
[^p.17^] 
rarity and wonderfulness of its 
operation does consist, as I have 
made appear in former observations. 
 
But it is not to be thought as 
some have imagined, that this 
property of binding renders it 
so fixative as to keep within 
the febrifick matter, or other 
morbifick causes dispersed in 
the humours, or adhering to 
the solid parts, it it so far from 
that, that by reviting the homogenious 
parts of the blood, 
it seperates them from the heterogenious 
or superabundant 
parts, whereby it facilitates their 
expulsion, for which Nature alone 
does often labour in vain, 
in the same manner as by 
strengthning and fortifying 
[^p.18^] 
the viscera, it puts them in a 
condition of resisting all attacks, 
and of discharging themselves 
of the Impurties that 
oppress them. 
 
Experience well agrees with 
these remarks, for the heat that 
dries up and consumes the Hecticks 
is often extinguished by 
the use of several Preparations 
of the Jesuites Powder. It is no 
less powerful against all other 
internal Inflammations, Feavers, 
and generally against all extraordinary 
and preternatural 
Fermentations; in a very short 
time it rectifies the depraved 
motion and the altered consistency 
of the mass of Blood, and 
it many times occasion such 
[^p.19^] 
salutary evacuations, that having 
dreined the sourse of Dropsies, 
by the depuration of the 
natural voices, which through 
their depravation and transudation 
were become the antecedent 
cause of it, that it becomes 
the principal cause of 
the expulsion of the extravasated 
Superfluities which were 
the conjunct cause of the same. 
 
It is nevertheless strange, that 
among so many Authors, who 
with admiration have written 
of its effects, not so much as 
one have taken the pains to explain 
them by their true causes, 
nor indeed thought that it 
could be done; for Willis, who 
without doubt hath spoken 
[^p.20^] 
most judiciously on that subject 
limits himself to this, that having 
never seen any other 
such like effects, and not being 
able to ground a general 
conclusion upon a particular 
experiment, all that is to be 
done is to endeavour to understand 
and well observe the 
phœnomina that depends thereon, 
without troubling ones 
self with the efficient principles 
thereof. 
 
But to make appear how far 
one may err in the explication 
of things, when they are not 
known by their proper causes, 
it will not be amiss here to relate 
some opinions of that Author 
touching the effects of the 
[^p.21^] 
Jesuits Powder upon the mass 
of Blood: The first is that it 
always causes therein a certain 
Fermentation that only destroys, 
that of the Feaver because 
it proceeds from another 
cause: Now the Jesuites Powder 
does indeed sift the fermentation 
of the Blood and the other 
Humours, but not excite any 
it self: The Second is, that it 
maintains its effect no longer 
than it is in the Vessels, and 
that so soon as all the parts 
thereof are spent and gone, 
the disposition that it had suppressed 
infallibly wears, in so 
much that the Relapse is as certain 
as the stopping of the 
Fit: Nevertheless, the contrary 
[^p.22^] 
appears daily almost, to any 
who knows how to use it aright: 
to be short, the Third is, 
that it stops not the Fits of the 
Feaver, neither by fixing nor 
yetby resolving the Blood as other 
febrifuges do; nevertheless 
it is certainl ytrue that the principal 
effect of bitter, astringent 
and stiptick febrifuges is, the 
reuniting of the proper parts 
of the blood divided and scattered 
by the disordered Animal 
Spirits, or by Heterogenious 
and superfluous matters. 
 
The Author of the Additions 
to Scroderus has had no 
better luck, in saying that Quinquina, 
or the Jesuites Powder 
cures the Feaver by the virtue 
[^p.23^] 
that it hath in Precipitating the 
Fabrick Ferment, for besides 
that it is hard to be understood 
how a matter contained within 
Vessels, and mingled with the 
Blood, can be Precipitated by 
a Medicine whose principal 
action is directly opposite to 
that of evacuatives; those kinds 
of Precipitations being only to 
be made by Urines, by little 
and little, and in a considerable 
space of time, cannot rationally 
be attributed to the Jesuites 
Powder, that acts so 
powerfully, and so suddenly 
produces its effect, that many 
times a single Dose of it, stops 
and prevents the immediately 
approaching fit of an Ague. 
 
The Author of the Cure of 
[^p.24^] 
Feavers and Agues by Quinquina, 
who makes the cause of the 
Feaver to consist in a certain 
Acide Ferment, refers the effects 
of that Medicine to the 
faculty that it hath of subduing, 
mortifying, and resolving 
that Poison; but that Author 
hath not minded, that if in effect 
Quinquina were able to destroy 
or even to expel the Acides 
that are in the blood, it 
would not be taken without entirely 
perverting that Liquor, 
seeing it would deaden or drive 
out the very Acides that make 
naturally a part of the same, 
and that it must necessarily lose 
its form and be changed into 
another kind of juyce, if the 
greatest part of one or the other 
[^p.25^] 
of its Elementary principles 
were taken from it. 
 
Mr. Lamery in his new course 
of Chymistry is not so wide of 
the Truth, when he says that 
Quinquina does fix and coagulate 
the Feaverish Humor, much 
in the same manner as an Alcali 
sifts the motion of an Acide 
Salt; for in effect it is the 
property of that remedy, to 
rally, bring together, and reunite 
the parts of the liquid body 
wherewith it is mingled, as often 
as it is put in action by necessary 
dispositions; but that 
Author hath omited to take 
notice that this reunion is only 
made of the proper parts of the 
blood, and that the Febrifick 
matter remains confounded in 
[^p.26^] 
the superfluous Serosity wherewith 
it is evacuated, either by 
Transpiration or by the way of 
Urine. 
 
The Principle that I have Established 
is of another Nature 
than the Opinions which I have 
now related; it is plain, clear, 
just, and every way conforms 
to all the Experiments that 
have hitherto been made upon 
the Jesuits Powder, and I cannot 
tell but that I may say to 
all that shall be made hereafter, 
for whether it be given for 
our sort of Feavers, or for another, 
for Vapours (against 
which I take it to be very good) 
for Dropsies, or for other Distempers, 
wheter it be given 
in Substance, Infusion, Tincture, 
[^p.27^] 
Opiat, Extract, or 
Quintessence: I am persuaded 
that its pincipal effect will always 
be to separate the proper 
and Homogenious parts of Liquors 
from those that are Heterogeneous 
and of a different 
Nature to them, to reunite 
the one, and by that reunion 
to facilitate the expulsion 
of the others, yet with this 
difference, that that effect will 
be more or less considerable, 
according to the good or bad 
use and Administration that 
shall be made therof. 
 
Moreover, That we may 
not too slightly pass over the 
different Preparations that may 
be made of Quinquina, I am 
not to omit that Pol Fincius 
[^p.28^] 
describes a kind of Essence of it, 
which is nothing else but its 
Tincture Extracted with excellent 
Wine, and afterward gentlely 
evaporated: That Sturmius 
makes a description of another 
much like to it, that the 
Author of the Cure of Feavers 
by Quinquina, will have it to 
be given in Bolus Extract, Fermented 
Liquors, and in Infusions 
made in Wine, Ale, Distilled 
Waters, Tisance, and in 
common water, that Mr. Lamery 
gives the Preparations of 
a Tincture, of an Extract, and 
of a Salt of Quinquina, that 
there are other ways of preparing 
it to be found in several 
Authors which I think needless, 
[^p.29^] 
to cite, and that after all the more 
simple and less artificial of all these 
preparations are the best, as will 
appear iu the description of the 
English Remedy; which being to 
be preferred to all that have hitherto 
been prepared with Quinquiua, 
ought to serve us as a Pattern, 
untill we have discovered 
some more Excellent. 
 
It is an Error in Physick to make 
a hodge-podge of a great many ingredients 
(though they be much of the 
same efficace) to satisfie one and 
the same indication; and therefore 
as Quinquina or the Bark of Peru, 
whereof I have now given you the 
History, is without contradiction 
the surest of all simple Febrifuges, 
so is it the only basis of the English 
Remedy, and it will even appear 
[^p.30^] 
by the following description, that of 
the Physitians, Chyrurgeons, and 
Apothecaries, that have endeavoured 
to imitate it, those who have 
prepared it most simply, have come 
the nearest to it, and hereby it is 
evident that that Author who boasted 
every where that he had found 
it out, was very far from it, since he 
always immagined that the virtue 
of Quinquina might be improved 
by fermenttaion, and by the addition 
of the flowers and salt of lesser 
Centaury, White Tartar, Sal-Armoniack, 
Sassafras-wood, Juniper-berries, 
and some other ingredients. 
 
To conclude, though that Remedy 
consists in several different preparations, 
yet still they refer indifferently 
to the principle of simplicity 
that I have mentioned; and this 
[^p.31^] 
will better appear in the Receipts of 
them, that Sir Kobert Talbor gave 
the King, and which are here transcribed 
with all the exactness that 
the matter requires. 
 
[}The first infusion of Quinquina, or 
the Jesuits Powder making a part 
of the English Remedy.}] 
 
TAke a pound of the best bark 
of Quinquina beaten to a 
subtil powder and searced, besprinkle 
it interchangably for the space 
of a day or two with the decoction 
of Anis and the juice of Parsley, 
then put the powder into an Eearthen 
Pitcher holding about fifteen 
or sixteen quarts, pour upon it 
gently and still stirring the matter, 
asmuch good Claret Wine as the 
[^p.32^] 
Vessel will hold, and having afterward 
stopt it well, let your mixture 
infuse for the space of eight days 
without setting it near the fire, but 
not forgeting to stir it two or three 
times a day with a stick or instrument 
fit to stir the bottom, afterward 
having poured off your 
liquor, through a close strainer, 
put it into glass bottles, which being 
well stopt and placed in a dry 
place not too Airy, will preserve 
it in full force and virtue two or 
three months and more. 
 
[}Directions given by the most Christian 
King's Chief Physitian, 
concerning the use of this first 
infusion.}] 
 
This first infusion, which is the 
strongest and bitterest, is to be given 
to stop the fits of an Ague or 
[^p.33^] 
Feaver that one would Cure, the 
Dose of it for those of Age and 
strong persons, is five or six ounces, 
that is about half an English 
pint; but for those who are naturally 
delicate, of a hot constitution, 
or not much accustomed to 
Wine, this Dose ought to be a 
fourth part less, a third part, yea 
and sometimes one half less, observing 
to correct each Dose with 
the addition of a little of the juice 
of a Lemon or an Orange, when 
there is no consideration that hinders 
from choosing the most convenient 
time to give the first Dose 
of that infusion, it ought always 
to be at the end of a Fit, but seeing 
in Quartan Agues that choice 
might retard the Cure for three 
or four days, in that case it may 
[^p.34^] 
be usefully given the night before 
the next fit that is expected; but 
then it is good to fortifie each 
Dose, by some drops of the Essence 
or Tincture whereof we shall speak 
hereafter. 
 
After one hath began to give 
of this infusion, he must continue 
to make the Patient take it once 
every three hours untill the time 
of the next fit, unless in time of 
sleep, which ought never to be interrupted, 
and renew again the use 
of it in the beginning of the intermission, 
but with this observation, 
that after the Patient hath missed 
one Fit, it will be enough to give 
a Dose in the morning fasting, and 
another a long time after Supper; 
which is only to be be continued 
for five or six days. 
 
[^p.35^] 
[}The second infusion of Quinquina, 
making part of the English Remedy.}] 
 
Take the setlings or remainder 
of the former infusion, put it into 
the same Earthen Pitcher, or into 
another of he same bigness, with 
half a pound of fresh Jesuits Powder 
prepared as hath been said, fill 
the Pot with the same Wine, and 
observe in general, as well for the 
preparation as the preservation of 
that second infusion, all the circumstances 
directed for the first, 
with this difference only, that for 
the making of this, ten days are 
to be employed. 
 
[^p.36^] 
[}Directions given by the King's 
Chief Physitian, concerning the 
Vse of this second infusion.}] 
 
When after the Feaver hath 
ceased, the first infusion hath been 
given morning and evening for the 
space of six days, the use of the second 
is to be begun and continued 
for Eight days, observing the 
same Dose as of the first, but only 
once a day in the morning when 
the Patient awakes. 
 
[}The third infusion of Quinquina, 
making part of the English Remedy,}] 
 
Take the settlings of the second 
infusion, and without any addition 
put it again into the same 
[^p.37^] 
Pitcher with the same quantity 
of Wine, and having let it 
stand in infusion for the space 
of ten days, and observed the 
directions prescribed for the 
preparation and preservation of 
the two former infusions, keep it 
for the use hereafter mentioned. 
 
[}Directions given by the Kings 
chief Physitian concerning the 
use of the third Infusion.}] 
 
The eight days preseribed for 
the use of the second Infusion 
being expired, we must begin 
with the third, which is then 
sufficiently strong. It is not to 
be given for the first fortnight 
but in one Dose every other 
day, and then to desist by degrees, 
[^p.38^] 
that is, for the next fortnight 
to reduce it to a Dose 
once every third day, and so to 
continue until the Patient hath 
taken of all the three Infusions 
about eight quarts. 
 
[}The Essence or Tincture of Quinquina, 
making part of the 
English Remedy.}] 
 
Take two Ounces of Quinquina, 
Pulverised, searched and 
then Alkolized upon a Marble 
Stone, put it into a Glass Bottle, 
and pour upon it eight 
Ounces of the best Spirit of 
Wine, set your Bottle in the 
Sun for the space of fifteen days, 
taking care to stir and shake it 
well at least once a day, afterward 
[^p.39^] 
pour off your Tincture, 
and keep it in a Bottle closely 
stopt, to be used as occasion 
shall require. 
 
[}Directions given by the Kings 
chief Physician; concerning the 
use of the Essence or Tincture 
of Quinquina.}] 
 
Besides what hath been said 
touching the use of this Essence 
or Tincture, when we spake of 
the time of giving the first Infusion, 
it is still to be observed 
that the virtue of each Dose of 
that infusion is to be encreased 
and fortified by the addition of 
five, six or even seven or eight 
drops of this Tincture, as often 
as the contumacy of the Ague 
[^p.40^] 
hath resisted its operation after 
several Doses; but this addition is 
to be regulated by a skiful Physitian, 
who is to take his indications 
from the nature of the Disease, 
and the dispositions of the 
subject. 
 
[}An Opiat prepared with Quinquina, 
making part of the English 
Remedy.}] 
 
Take what quantity you please 
of Jesuits Powder, prepared as is 
above directed, and incorporate 
it with a sufficient quantity of the 
syrup of Lemons, or of Grimes if 
it be for a Woman with Chlld; 
reducing all into the consistencie 
of an Opiat by an exact mixture. 
 
[^p.41^] 
[}Directions given by the Kings 
Chief Physician, concerning the 
use of the Opiat.}] 
 
There are some Patients upon 
whom the first infusion 
though fortified by the addition 
of the Essence or Tincture 
has not sufficient virtue 
to stop the Ague fits; to these the 
specifick is to be given in substance, 
and the best and most 
commodious way of doing it, 
is the Opiat that is now described, 
it may be given from four 
to six Drachms, once or twice 
a day according as need shall 
require, and that either upon the 
point of a Knife, in a Wafer, or 
in what other manner one 
pleases. 
 
[^p.42^] 
[}A Purging Wine making part of 
the English Remedy.}] 
 
Take an Ounce of good 
Hiera Pica, and infuse it for 
the space of eight days in half 
a Pint or a little more of Claret 
wine, observing to stir the bottle 
wherein you have put it, only 
once a day for the first three 
days, and not at all to move or 
shake it during the other five, 
afterward pour out your infusion 
gently by inclining the 
bottle, into another bottle which 
is to be closely stopped, and 
keep it for the use follwing. 
 
[^p.43^] 
[}Directions given by the Kings Chief 
Physitian, concerning the use of 
this Purging-Wine.}] 
 
When by reason of the Patients 
repletion, or a supervement 
constipation the belly must be 
opened, we must add to each quart 
of the infusion of Quinquina three 
or four spoonfuls of the above-described 
Purging-Wine, mingling 
all exactly together, and use 
it in the same manner as hath been 
directed when we spoke of the infusions, 
that is to say, in a greater 
or smaller quantity, according as 
it shall happen in the time of the 
first, second, or third infusion, and 
also according to the indications 
taken from the present state of the 
Patient, and of the Disease. 
 
[^p.44^] 
It is observed that when there 
is no considerable repletion, and 
that the costiveness is but moderate, 
simple glysters made of Milk 
and the yoalks of Eggs, are to be 
preferred before all kinds of purgatives, 
too great a loosness of the 
belly being always contrary to the 
operation of the specifick. 
 
[}Other Directions given by the 
Kings Chief Physitian, concerning 
what is to be oserved during 
the course of the English Remedy.}] 
 
As it is sometimes useful to open 
the belly during the use of the 
English Remedy, so at other times 
it is of great importance to stop it 
when by a preceding or supervenient 
loosness, the digestion is 
[^p.45^] 
weakened, and the chyle rendred 
impure; for such dispositions are 
very much contrary to the Cure 
of Agues: in such a case it is 
necessary that besides the Doses 
of the specifick that are given 
every day, there be at least two 
given mingled with an equal part 
of the tincture of Roses, extracted 
upon hot embers with common 
water, and without the addition 
of the spirit of Vitriol, or any other 
acid spirit; for that effect an ounce 
of red Roses is sufficient for a quart 
of water: this tincture is extracted 
in twenty four hours, and after 
it is poured off, three ounces of 
good white Sugar is to be added 
to each quart. 
 
In time of the intermission of the 
Fits, and as much as may be at the 
[^p.46^] 
usual hours of eating, the Patients 
may feed upon what their appetite 
enclines them to, and choose 
such food as Nature seems to desire, 
without any reservation, unless 
it be of salt Pork and Bacon, 
yet still observing to prefer solid 
food before liquid, and in case of 
thirst or hunger, not to drink untill 
a quarter of an hour, and not 
to eat till an hour after each Dose 
of the Specifick, that the distribution 
and digestion that ought 
to be made thereof be not interrupted. 
 
It is moreover to be observed, 
that water and tizanne or barley-water 
do weaken the virtue of 
the remedy, and that so, Wine and 
Water, Beer or Ale, such as men 
drink when they are in health is 
[^p.47^] 
to be preferred before all other 
Bevrage. Furthermore, seeing the 
operation of the Specifick tends 
always to the recovery of strength, 
and that other remedies do necessarily 
diminish it, they cannot be 
used both at a time, without interrupting 
many salutary operations, 
and without exposing the 
Patients to an almost certain danger, 
and especially those who by 
their proper Constitution, by Age 
or the Contumacy of the Disease, 
are already much weakened and 
extenuated; and therefore, as we 
have just now observed, the operation 
of the Remedy cannot be 
more efficaciously assisted than by 
the use of the most nourishing 
meats, because they concur with 
it to the reparation of strength, 
[^p.48^] 
and put the Patients in a condition 
of enjoyning perfect health 
so soon as the Ague is stopt. 
 
Nevertheless a prudent Physitian 
who intends to give the Specificker 
may sometimes by Bloob-letting, 
Purging, and other ordinary 
Medicins, correct tha bad 
dispositions of the body, that might 
hinder the benefit which is to be 
expected from it; but these Remedies 
being only to be considered 
as simple preparatives, they 
are always to be used before the 
Specifick, which is never more 
powerful than when it is given 
by itsself. 
 
[^p.49^] 
[}Other Observations of the Kings 
chief Physician, concerning the 
Virtues of he English Remedy.}] 
 
Never did Remedy better deserve 
the name of a specifick Febrifuge; 
for never did any as yet 
come to our knowledg, that hath 
so speedily and securely stopt, and 
cured Feavers and Agues, as that 
hath done. The truth is, Quinquina, 
which maketh the basis of 
it, and which we have had knowledg 
of for about thirty years, does 
almost infallibly stop the fits of 
Intermittent Feavers, when it is 
given in substance in white, some 
without other ceremony; that is 
to say, according to the method 
Prescribed by the Jesuits, who 
[^p.50^] 
were the first that brought that 
Bark into Europe; And in Authors 
that have written since that time 
some other preparations are to be 
found which are believed to be 
more efficacious; but experience 
hath convinced us, that these Authors 
had not as yet found out 
the securest method to prevent 
those troublesome relapses, which 
to this present rendered that Remedy 
contemptible, and we must 
confess that we are in some manner 
obliged to Sir Robert Talbor, 
for having given us a Preparation 
much to be preferred before all 
others, whether he hath been the 
inventer of it, or that he hath hit 
upon it by chance; and it may 
be said, that his boldness (which 
would have been taken for a criminal 
[^p.51^] 
rashness in any but an Emperick) 
hath not a little contributed 
to the knowledg which we 
have at present of its use and manner 
of application. 
 
The most wonderful effects of 
this Febrifuge appears in all intermittent 
Feavers, which are its 
true object; for it stops, and 
in fine wholly Cures Quotidian 
Agues, Tertian, double Tertian, 
Quartans, double and tripple 
Quartans, and sometimes also other 
kinds of Feavers; for there 
are come continued Feavers, which 
having kinds of Intermissions and 
Regular Paroxysms observable by 
some small cold in the extremities 
of the Body, or some horror 
and shivering betwixt the Shoulders, 
are cured by the specifick, 
[^p.52^] 
almost as speedily and securely 
as the true Intermittent Feavers; 
and this happens often in 
respect of slow Hectick Feavers 
accompanied with a Consumption, 
such as Children are commonly 
affected with, because 
they have certain inequalities of 
remission and augmentation 
which give ground to the Remedy 
to exert its virtue to second 
the attempts of Nature, 
and by consequence to reduce 
the blood unto its former disposition, 
and to restore the Stomach 
to its Natural strength, 
so that for the futue providing 
only good and well digested 
Chyle, it sends a Vivifying humidity 
to all the parts, which 
corrects their dryness and restores 
[^p.53^] 
the lost Plumpness and 
good habit of body. 
 
It is nevertheless to be observed, 
that since the matter of 
continued Feavers is diffused 
through the whole mass of 
blood, that herein it causes acorruption 
hard to be rectified, and 
that it wholly takes up Nature 
without giving her any respite, 
she cannot be in a condition to 
concur the with Specifick, but till 
by blood letting and Purging, 
the impure and Heterogeneous 
matter be in some manner expulsed, 
the irritation of the Spirins 
calmed, and the humours 
be in good enough temper to 
return into favour with Nature, 
without which the Specifick, 
which does not always excite 
[^p.54^] 
regular Evacuations, is not 
powerful enough to put a stop 
to the sedition, and compose 
the disorder, which is then in 
the great Vessels, and in all the 
other principle and more necessary 
parts of the body. 
 
For the better understanding 
of the abovementioned directions 
and observations, I would 
have it remarked, That every 
thing that occasions an extraordinary 
agitation in the spirits, 
humors, and generally in the 
liquid and fluid parts of our 
body, may be considered as the 
primitive cause of Feavers, that 
is to say, of those irregular motions 
which happen so often in 
the mass of blood, but seems 
the same motions would be 
[^p.55^] 
quickly rectified by Nature, 
were they not kept in being by 
some permanent cause, and 
that besides, by discomposing 
all the œconomy of Nature, 
they corrupt the Ferments that 
serve for Digestion, and by that 
means render the Chyle impure, 
and of a bad quality; the 
depraved Chylification may be 
looked upon as the immediate 
and antecedent cause of Feavers; 
so that a Remedy cannot 
truly be a Febrifuge, unless all at 
once it correct both the bad 
disposition of Stomach, and of 
the Ferments, of which I have 
been speaking, and that is the 
proper effeet of the English 
Febrifuge, for like the most part 
of bitter Medicaments, it is 
[^p.56^] 
very Stomachical, being proper 
to consume the superfluous 
humidities, and to restore the 
bone of the relaxated Fibres of 
the Ventricle, and by that means 
to encrease the dimished appetite, 
and retrive it when it is 
wholely lost, from whence depends 
the perfect digestion of 
the Victuals, even of the most 
solid Food; I cannot tell if 
one may not affirm it to be also 
more Cordial: for besides, 
that it re-establishes the scattered 
forces of the Body, and the 
decayed natural heat, it fixes 
the heterogeneous Particles 
that cause the Fermentation of 
the Blood, and rallies and calls 
together those which have been 
divided and scattered during 
its ebullition. 
 
[^p.57^] 
This Augmentation of force 
and heat makes it sometimes 
appear as if this Febrifuge did 
re-kindle the Feaver after the 
taking of the first Dose; but it 
only augments it, that it may 
the better engage with it, and 
that apparent disorder is the surest 
sign of its triumph: for the 
more violent it renders one fit, 
the more we may be assured 
that it will not be followed by 
another. 
 
Many Physicians cannot conceive 
how this Remedy which 
seems onely to be fixative, can 
radically cure Feavers and Agues 
(but it is to be observed 
that though it causes not always 
a sensible evacuation, yet 
it so powerful seconds the inclinations 
[^p.58^] 
of nature, that during 
its operation the heterogenious, 
impure or superfluous matters, 
are most commonly forced out 
to the superfice of the body, to 
be evacuated by insensible transpiration, 
and even very often 
by copious sweats, as also it is 
sometime the occasion of a critical 
looseness of the belly, and 
in many Patients, the way of the 
urine serves for so salutary an 
evacuation, that is cures both 
together, the Quartan Ague and 
the Dropsie occasioned by it. 
 
Furthermore, though the 
most certain and regular operation 
of the English Remedy, 
be to stop the fits of intermittent 
Feavers, yet the use of it is 
not to be thought of dangerous 
[^p.59^] 
consequence; it causes no trouble 
in the œconomy of Nature, 
being like other bitter temperate 
medicaments, incapable of 
making any bad impression on 
mans body, for the reunion that 
it makes of the parts of the 
blood, always facilitates the expulsion 
of morbifick Causes, 
and though they should partly 
stay within after its operation; 
yet by means of it they are corrected 
and reconciled to nature, 
or at least by reiterated and 
continual digestions, they are 
at length conconcted, ripened 
and dissipated, 
 
[^p.60^] 
[}Observations of the Kings chief 
Physician, concerning the practice 
of Sir Robert Talbor, in 
the preparation and distribution 
of his Remedy.}] 
 
The greatest secret of most of 
Empiricks, consists only in disguising 
the the Drugs that they make 
use of; for since they are the very 
same whereof Physicians know 
the Nature and Properties, they 
could not make them pass for secret 
Remedies, unless they are affectedly 
gave them an air of novelty; 
thus did Sir Robert Talbor in the 
preparation of the Jesuits Powder, 
either to make it be believed that 
the virtue of his Febrifuge did not 
depend on that Book, or to make 
[^p.61^] 
it be though that he understood 
it much better than those that had 
made use of it before him; for it 
was very ordinary with him to besprinkle 
six Drachms of Red Roses 
with two Ouuces of the juice of 
Lemons; and afterward to infuse 
them for the space of four hours 
in six Pound of Fountain water, 
to make use of that infusion for 
the making of his Remedy, adding 
thereunto eight ounces of 
Quinquina, powdered and besprinkled 
with four ounces of 
the Juyce of Fennel Root, and 
put into infusion only for the 
space of twelve hours. 
 
Sometimes instead of that 
Juyce he would employ the 
Juyce of Smallage Leaves, and 
at other times again that of 
[^p.62^] 
Parsley, especially in Tertian, 
and double Tertian Agues. 
 
In continued Feavers, he assured 
us, that on the contrary 
he made use of the Juyces of 
the Plantin and Lettice, and in 
Malignant Feavers of the Decoction 
of Scorsonera. 
 
In Quotidian Agues he commonly 
besprinkled his Powder 
with Vinegar of Squills, at the 
proportion of one ounce upon 
eight of the Jesuits Powder, 
which he afterwards infused 
sometimes in Rhenish Wine, and 
sometimes in White Wine. 
 
For Quartan Agues he preferred 
the Juyce of Pentaphyllum 
(Cinquefoil) and made his 
infusion sometimes in Spanish 
Wine. 
 
[^p.63^] 
In slow and Hectick Feavers, 
he used the Juice of Colts Foot 
and Ground Ivie, and made his 
infusion in one part of Wine, 
two parts of Barley Water, and 
one part of the Tincture of Roses. 
 
He followed that Practice indifferently 
for both Sexes, only 
with this difference, that with 
Women he ceased the use of 
his Remedy during their Courses, 
and Prepared it for those 
that were with Child, or in 
Child-Bed, in this manner; After 
that he had wet his Quinquina 
with two ounces of the 
Juyce of Quinces, he infused it 
in equal parts of Wine and the 
Tincture of Roses. 
 
[^p.64^] 
In respect of Complicated 
Agues, he observed always to 
give his Febrifuge either in the 
Declension of the Fit, or in the 
beginning of the sweating, but 
that circumspection was commonly 
the more useless, that 
without considering, if these 
kinds of Feavers were the cause 
or the effects of other Distempers, 
he always bent himself 
wholly to the Cure of them; 
and it was by sticking to that 
pernicious Maxim, that he erred 
so grosly in the Disemper 
of the Dauphin of France, whose 
Feaver proceeding from Vomiting 
and the weakness of his Stomach, 
was encreased considerably 
by the use of his Febrifuge, 
and on the contrary ceased of it 
[^p.65^] 
self, when Remedies were only 
applied to correct the indisposition 
that was the cause of it; not but 
that that Remedy hath some virtue 
against Vomiting and weakness 
of the Stomach which proceed 
from Crudities, Indigestion, and 
Relaxation of the Fibres of the 
Stomach; but it is absolutely contrary 
to those that are raised by 
a hot intemperature of the Viscera, 
and fomented by the irritation 
of overflowing choler, as that 
of the Dauphins was. 
 
Hence one may judg how dangerous 
it is to trust the life and 
health of men, to the conduct of 
such kind of People, whose knowledg 
is always too much limited, 
to reach beyond the general Rules 
and Directions contained in their 
[^p.66^] 
Receipts, and to descend into the 
exceptions that are indicated by 
sound judgment, experience, and 
the Principles of a judicious Doctrine. 
 
It is true, Sir Robert Talbor did 
not always observe the directions 
prescribed in his Receipt, touching 
the time of the infusion of 
Quinquina; but in that he was the 
more to be blamed: for besides 
that, it is impossible that that Bark 
can in twelve; nay, even in twenty 
four hours, impart all its bitterness 
and virtue to the Wine; 
there is still much more time required 
to have the infusion so depurated 
as it is to be wished, that 
it may not be nauseous, nor apt 
to cause obstructions in the capillary 
Vessels, which hath caused 
[^p.67^] 
troublesome inconveniences to 
many who have been treated by 
that Emperick. 
 
Upon the same account it was, 
that in these late times thinking it 
best to give the Jesuits Powder in 
Bolus, and by that means to revive 
in some measure the antient 
and primitive method, which was 
to give it in substance; he hath 
often been the cause of many Diseases 
far more pernicious than the 
Ague, which he pretended to 
Cure, the different Juyces wherewith 
he besprinkled his Powder, 
being incapable to render it so distributive 
as not to stick in some 
part. 
 
But what preference soever the 
infusions contained in the description 
of the English Remedy may 
[^p.68^] 
deserve, it is still true that seeing 
they cannot be safe but by the 
right use of them, it is no wonder 
if their effect hath sometimes badly 
corresponded to the undertakings 
of Sir Robert Talbor, since 
he gave them indifferently in all 
times of the Feaver, which cannot 
be stopt in the beginning, 
without unpleasing consequences, 
that indisposition, to speak properly, 
being only a kind of Crisis 
excited by nature to force out of 
the Vessels, Crude impure and 
superfluous matters, which by consequent 
cannot be stop too early, 
but that the ferments will lurk 
and remain in their Focus's quarters, 
and subsist in full force, 
which hath been the cause of those 
dangerous relapses, that first 
[^p.69^] 
brought the Jesuits Powder into 
contempt, which notwithstanding 
is a most excellent Febrifuge. 
 
I do nevertheless acknowledg 
that there are some occasions, 
wherein in the very beginning of 
the Feaver an urgent danger seems 
to demund a speedy truce; but 
when, to have time to looæ about 
us, we have capitulated with the 
Disease, we have procured an advantage 
that cannot withou great 
danger be abused, and whereof we 
cannot secure our selves the possession, 
but by observing the Maxims 
long since received, concerning 
the use of the Jesuits Powder; 
that is to say, without ordering a 
Diet, Blood Letting, and especially 
Purging, which by experience we 
know to be of indispensable necessity. 
 
[^p.70^] 
And now since I speak of Purging, 
I ought not to omit to say 
that it may be practised with success, 
before, or in the time, and after 
the use of the specifick, observing 
the following Directions. When 
there is nothing that hinders from 
preparing the Body to receive the 
Jesuits Powder, the essential part 
of that Preparation consits in 
Purging Patients well, after they 
have been once or twice Let Blood, 
and that with relation to the quantity 
of the superfluities and the 
degrees of repletion. When the 
action of the Ferments seems to 
resist the operation of the Febrifuge, 
and that therefore one is obliged 
to administer Purgatives in 
the very time of using it, its force 
is to be augmented, or the Doses 
[^p.71^] 
doubled, to the end that by the 
motion of the matters which are 
to be evacuated, the perturbation 
of the Blood be not encreased. 
In fine, when after we have done 
with the Remedy, we would by 
Purgatives prevent relapses, it is 
better to give moderate and reiterated 
Purges, than to give stronger 
Doses, and in less number. 
 
Furthermore, the ambition of 
Sir Robert Talbor having enclined 
him to extend the use of his Remedy 
beyonds its efficacy, it is 
well known that he hath given it 
on divers occasions for continued 
Feavers, wherein there was neither 
intention nor remission to be 
observed, which was always attended 
with tragical symptoms, 
and very often with death it self; 
[^p.72^] 
for that Remedy can never be 
successfully given in those kind of 
Feavers, unless when some manifest 
Paroxysms are observed, that 
they continued for several days, 
that the Patients have been Purged 
by all ways, and that they stand 
in need of a respite to recollect 
strength, and so to relieve Nature, 
and give her time to perfect the 
Cure of the Distemper, which in 
vain she strove to furmount without 
that aid and assistance. 
 
He was guilty of a no smaller 
fault, in forcing, if I may say so, 
his Patients to drink Wine, and 
to eat solid Food during the whole 
time of continued Feavers, and 
in time of the Fit in Agues; for 
though in the abatement of the 
one, and the intermission of the 
[^p.73^] 
others, that kind of nourishment 
may back and fortifie the operation 
of the Remedy; yet they 
considerably oppress the Patients, 
when Nature is taken up in defending 
her self against the vigour 
of the Distemper that attacks her, 
and then it appears that the prudence 
and skill of a Learned and 
Experienced Physician, are at least 
of as great relief on such occasions, 
as the most efficacious and salutory 
Medicines. 
 
I have no more to say to shew 
how little confidence we ought 
to have in such kind of Empiricks, 
but that it is strange that 
this man who hath prescribed 
to us so may juyces, and such 
like trifles about the composition 
of his Febrifuge, whereof 
[^p.74^] 
the principle effect is only to be 
attributed to the Jesuits Powder, 
should conceale the use that 
he made of Opium, whereof he 
many times added some drops 
of Tincture to this Febrifuge, 
which may be of great advantage 
when it is given seasonably 
in over watchings, light 
headedness, and loosness, which 
are frequent symptoms in Feavers, 
and always allayed by the 
virtue of that excellent Medicine, 
 
I hope the Reader will take in 
good part, that I describe in this 
place a Febrifuge Opiat prepared 
with Quinquina, and afterward 
explain its effects, with relation 
to the Nature of Feavers and Agues. 
 
[^p.75^] 
[}An Excellent Febrifuge.}] 
 
Take of the Jesuits Powder, 
the Flowers or Leaf of lesser 
Centaury subtilly Pulverised, 
and of Treacle, of each a like 
weight, make them into an Opiat, 
of which the Patient twice 
a day shall take the weight of a 
Drachm and a half, during 
the space of six days, drinking 
upon it a Glass of good Claret 
with Plantin or Bugloss water. 
 
[}Reflections upon the use of this 
Febrifuge.}] 
 
The excellency of a Remedy is 
very often the cause why it is despised. 
Antimony hath been in 
[^p.76^] 
our days a manifest instance of this, 
but the Jesuits Powder, and the 
English Febrifuge continue us 
more plainly of the truth of it 
so soon as chance or industry hath 
discovered a secret for any particular 
distemper; the people lay 
hold on't as of a Publick Good, 
and apply it indifferently to all 
sorts of evils; and if on some occasion 
it succeed not, as it must 
unavoidably come to pass, it is 
cried down with as much Zeal and 
Precipitance as it was brought in 
vogue. This is the fortune of all 
the new Febrifuges, having seen 
wonderful effects of them in some 
kinds of Feavers, men took them 
for Vniversal Remedies; but so 
soon as they found them produce 
bad consequences in others for 
[^p.77^] 
which they were not proper, it was 
then generally concluded that it 
was dangerous to make use of 
them. For this reason, that all 
scruples may be removed, which 
people may frame to themselves in 
the use of this Febrifuge. I have 
thought it pertinent carefully to 
engage into the Nature of Feavers, 
and to mark their differeces, 
to observe those which are 
submitted to this Remedy, and 
those to which it may prove prejudicial, 
and lastly to prove 
with how much usefulness it may 
be employed, when that is done 
with all care and necessary circumspection. 
 
Two motions are to be conceived 
in the blood, ihat of the whole 
[^p.78^] 
which is the circulation, and another 
of the parts proceeding from 
its liquidity. A Feaver is a 
fermentation of the blood, fermentation 
is an irregular motion 
of the insensible parts (motus 
intestinus partium insensibilium) 
We must look into the causes 
of the regular motion of this liquid 
body, that by the rule of 
contraries we may discover those 
of the irregular motion. 
 
There are two causes that maintain 
Vniformity in the motion of 
the blood. 1. Its quantity, and 
the constantly equal force of the 
spirits, which are the immediate 
movers and impulsers of all the 
parts that compose this liquid 
mass. 2. the just proportion of 
the same parts, as well in their 
[^p.79^] 
quantity and quality, as in their 
scituation, that is to say, when the 
Sulphureous, Acide, Watry and 
Earthy corpuscles, are not only in 
a laudable proportion as to quanty; 
but likewise are so well adjusted, 
and united together, that 
they no ways annoy one another, 
and are moved by the Spirits or 
Celestial matter that animates 
them, in a regular and uniform 
motion. As long as things are 
thus, it may be said that the blood 
is in its Natural state of Health, 
and to that end the Author of Nature 
hath not only made our body 
transpirable, thereby to give vent 
to the too great quantity of Spirits, 
but hath also put in different 
places, Bowels and percolatories 
designed to siltrate the superfluous 
[^p.80^] 
and exceeding parts, which 
might trouble the purety of that 
Liquor. 
 
From thence it may inferred 
that there are two immediate causes 
of the fermentation of the 
blood, the first is the too great 
quantity, or the tor great motion 
of the spirits, which may be excited 
by the heat of the Sun, violent 
excercise, watching, fasting, 
hot and spirituous nurishment; 
and the passions and perturbations 
of the mind, and from thence 
it is that all Feavers Ephemeræ 
or of one days continuance, and 
simple Synoches, which are the 
slightest of all, and may be cured 
by transpiration alone do arise, the 
second is the mixture of irregular 
and fermentative corpuscles (rerum 
[^p.81^] 
non miscibilium mixtio) 
which confounding the order and 
alliance of the parts of the Blood, 
raise a Sedition there, and deprave 
its motion. And of these Bodies 
some only raise a simple Fermentation, 
which at length may be governed 
and subdued by Nature, and the 
others being more Malignant and 
Venemous, cause Coagulations, Dissolutions, 
and Collignations in the 
mass of Blood, and can in no manner 
be corrected. From the former 
of these proceed all intermittent, 
erratick, and continued Feavers, 
which are called subintrant, 
and from the other spring Burning, 
Pestilential, Malignant and spotted 
Feavers. It is now to be considered 
in what parts of our Body, and 
how these humours are produced. 
 
[^p.82^] 
Though I have said that there 
are parts viscera appointed for the 
separation of the superfluities of the 
blood, yet seeing they do not always 
discharge their functions aright, either 
through a fault in themselves, 
or through the too great abundance 
of the same superfluities, the same 
are hurried away by the rapidity 
of the circulation, as filth is carried 
away by the impetuous current of a 
River; but in the same manner as 
there happens a turning in that River 
where the water is stiller, and 
where all that filth turning slowly 
with the current stops; so these heterogeneous 
bodies turn aside by the 
cœliack Artery into the branches of 
the Vena Porta, where the Blood 
circulates more slowly, and which 
for that reason may be compared 
[^p.83^] 
to a Lake or standing Pool of Water 
in respect of the other vessels: 
there it is where wanting their former 
agitation, they have the means 
of fastening and uniting together, to 
produce obstructions which are the 
primive Causes of all Feavers of 
the second order, and sometimes, 
but seldome, of those of the third, 
as I shall now illustrate. 
 
The Blood cannot be long stopt in 
a place without being exasperated 
and growing eager. 
 
The spirits which are constantly 
in motion flie away, and carry with 
them first the more volative parts, 
then the sulphureous which blunted 
and edge of the Salts, and kept them 
as in fetters; which is the cause 
that these bodies having now nothing 
to stop their activity, break off and 
[^p.84^] 
diffuce themselves through the mass 
of Blood to raise and ferment it, untill 
that being dispersed and dissolved 
in the serosity, they are expelled 
by the ordinary ways, or otherways 
do so adjust and accommodate 
themselves with the other parts, 
that they disturb their alliance and 
motion no more. 
 
There is nothing in Feavers but 
may be explained by this systeme. 
 
The obstruction and the ferment 
which remains in that part which 
is called the Focus, make the Periodick 
Fits and Paroxysms, which 
are sometimes quicker and sometimes 
slower, according as the exasperated 
humour is more gross or more 
subtile: the duplicity of Focus's or 
Magazines make the double intermittent 
Feavers. In a word there 
[^p.85^] 
happen sometimes so many of these 
nests, that giving no respite, they 
cause continued Feavers, which may 
be called subintrants. 
 
But it sometimes happens that 
these acid Salts, wheter through 
their their too long continuance in a 
place, or by an excessive heat of the 
entralls, acquire a pretty violent 
degree of corrosion, and are exalted 
to that height as to become venemous 
enough for spoiling, and wholly ruining 
all the œconomy of the blood, 
and causing those Feavers which by 
a general name are called Malignant; 
but since the more common 
cause of these Feavers, are Vrsenical 
Salts diffused through the Air 
which we breath, or lurking in 
the Food we eat, and that it is 
rare that our Natural heat which 
[^p.86^] 
is mild, should produce in our Bodies 
that which the most violent fire of 
Chymists can hardly perform in their 
Vessels, I said it was the less ordinary 
causes of those kinds of Feavers. 
 
Having laid down these Principles, 
I say that this Remedy is 
useless for the first, and dangerous 
for the third kind of Feavers; 
useless for the first, because they are 
commonly cured of themselves, and 
dangerous for the third, because a 
venemous Body, and such as in no 
ways can be subdued nor corrected 
ought never to be fixed; on the contrary 
it ought with all expedition to 
be driven out by sweats, or by other 
ways of evacuation: But I maintain 
that this Remedy answers all 
the indications that we can have 
for the Cure of those of the second 
order. 
 
[^p.87^] 
The Expication which I have 
given of these Feavers, which by a 
general name may be called intermittent, 
furnishes me with four 
indications for their Cure. 1. To 
stop the Fermentation of the Blood. 
2. To fix and correct the Acid which 
is the cause of it. 3. To dissolve, 
attenuate and drive out by the ordinary 
ways of evacuation the gross 
humours that make obstructions. 
4. And lastly to repair the loss of 
the Suplhureous and Vnctuous Corpuscles 
which sweetened the Blood, 
and which are evaporated by its 
offervenscencie. 1. The feaverish ebullition 
of the Blood is sufficiently 
stopt by the terrestrial and astringent 
parts of the Quinquina or Jesuits 
Powder, and by the lesser Centaury 
and the Opium that enters the 
[^p.88^] 
composition of the Treacle. 2. After 
so many fair experiments, we 
have no cause to doubt, but that 
the fixed Salt of the Quinquina is 
the true corrective of the Fermentative 
Acid of the Feaver. 3. Of 
all the ingredients that enter the 
composition of Treacle, there is 
none but drives out by sweating 
and Vrine the impurites of the 
Blood. Lastly we may be easily 
persuaded that the lesser Centaury 
is most proper for restoring the Sulphureous 
parts of the Blood which 
have been dissipated in the Fermentation, 
if we consider its wonderful 
virtue in consolidating of wounds; 
and if we observe that the reuniting 
of separated parts, is only performed 
by a Balsamick and Vnctuous 
Sulpher wherewith that Plant 
[^p.89^] 
abounds. The wine that is given 
immediately after contributes 
much also to that effect, especially 
when the activity of its spirits 
is checked by the mixture of the 
Plantin water, which on this occasson 
I should prefer before that 
of Bugloss. I pretend not for 
all this to exclude the general 
and common remedies of Physick. 
Nay, I maintain, that in 
the beginning once or twice Bloodletting, 
according to the strength 
and repletion of the Patient are 
necessary, as well for facilitating 
the circulation of the blood, as for 
remedying the pains of the head, 
and oppressions that Blood swelling 
in the fermentation, may cause in 
passing through the capillary vessels 
of the Brain and Lungs. This 
[^p.90^] 
Remedy is not to be given till first 
by a dissolution of Cassia or Catholicum, 
the excrements of the 
lower region, which may trouble 
its operation, be evacuated. And 
lastly, seeing the blood, like other 
Liquors in their ebullition, drives 
always towards the Mesentery a 
great many impure and fœculent 
parts like a scum, it is necessary 
in the declension of the evil to 
purge them out, if one would prevent 
relapses, and sometimes more 
troublesome consequences. 
 
Seeing it appears by the remarks 
of the Kings chief Physician, 
and by the foregoing reflexions, 
that Opium may usefully 
be added to the English Remedy, 
and other Febrifuges of 
the same Nature; I make no 
[^p.91^] 
doubt but that you will Read 
with pleasure the Natural History 
of that excellent Medicine.
