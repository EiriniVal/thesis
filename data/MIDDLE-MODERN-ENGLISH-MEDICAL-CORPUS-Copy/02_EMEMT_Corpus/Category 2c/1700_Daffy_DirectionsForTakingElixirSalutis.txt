[}DIRECTIONS 
for Taking 
ELIXIR SALUTIS 
Or, the Famous 
Purging Cordial, 
known by the Name of 
DAFFY's Elixir Salutis.}] 
 
[}The First general Observation.}] 
 
FOR such Persons as are opprest with Chronical Distempers, 
whether the Gout, Stone, Collick, Pthisick, Dropsie, &c. 
and have (divers Years) been tortured and bowed down 
under the Burthen of them: I say, for Distempers habitual to, and 
radicated in the Body; it cannot be rationally be expected that this 
(or any Means under Heaven) may on a sudden effect their Cure, 
any more, than that a small Shower of Rain (after a long season 
of Summers Drought) should presently revive the parched and 
dying Flowers and Herbs of the Field, and restore them to their 
lively verdure and greenness: To persons therefore infected with 
these Chronical Distempers, and disposed to use the means of this 
my Drink, I give this advice, that they take the same according to 
the ensuing particular Directions, and patiently wait upon the 
Almighty Physician of Soul and Body for his Blessing, and I 
doubt not, but they (as well as others have) will find very much 
relief, at least by ease of their pains, if not the perfect cure of 
their disease; which some Aged persons have happily experienced. 
[^p.2^] 
Moreover, let not the Patients (having taken this 
Drink) impatiently expect its operation of working with them, 
on a sudden; for experience hath found that on some Bodies 
it is 6 hours, some 8, and on some 12 hours, before it works: 
and in most Distempers, its operation is so gentle and moderate, 
that Patients may (with safety) follow their business and occasions, 
either at home or abroad. 
 
[}The Second general Observation.}] 
 
LEt the Patient (afflicted with any of the Distempers, in the 
Book of my Cordial Virtues mentioned) have a due regard to 
the state and condition of his or her Body: If the Body be Costive, 
(as most generally Persons under such Distempers are) the 
first dose (if the Age, and strength of nature will permit) to be 
three spoonfuls at the Patients going to Bed, and the like dose at 
the up-rising in the Morning: But in case the Body be Laxative, 
then let the first dose over-night be one spoonful, and another at 
the up-rising in the Morning, and so let the dose be increased by 
one spoonful each time, if the Patients strength may admit, till 
it comes to three spoonfuls, which (without good advice) none is to 
exceed. In taking the same, let the Patient use as much exercise 
and stirring, as strength of Body may admit. Here likewise observe, 
the Patient ought to avoid Melancholy, and keep a good 
dyet; and it is convenient to take a mess of Broth, or something 
warm, an hour after the Morning dose, which is found more 
proper than Posset-Ale. 
 
[}The Third general Observation.}] 
 
THis Drink hath been many Years experienced of so innocent 
and sure operation, that it may be safely taken at any season 
of the year; for neither heat nor cold can obstruct its influential 
operation on the Body. Moreover, this Drink will retain its Vertue, 
though kept two years together (as divers persons have found) 
but I suppose it may be kept much longer. Another Virtue and 
innate Propriety of this drink (distinguishing it from all othe 
Physick whatsoever) is, that at the Patients leaving off the same, 
the Patients Body remains not Costive, but in a very good healthrful 
temper and lightsome condition. 
 
[^p.3^] 
[}The GOUT.}] 
 
LET the Patient (having competent strength of Nature) take 
three spoonfuls of this Elixir in the Morning fasting, and 
the like Dose last at Night; the which course let it be followed so 
long as the Patients strength of Body will bear it, and especially 
if the pains be found to move from one joynt to another: I advise 
the Patient to be active, and use as much stirring exercise as conveniently 
may be. Here Note, That after four Doses, or twelve 
spoonfuls taking, the Patient may, (if the same be found to work 
five or six times a day) intermit a day, and then return to the 
Drink; taking then two spoonfuls in the Morning, one spoonful 
an hour before dinner, and two spoonfuls last at Night; but let 
not the patient, finding not his expectation answered on a sudden 
lay aside the further use of this Choice Remedy; for although 
some have been Cured of this torturing malady in taking out of 
one half-point Bottle of this Drink, yet some require a Pint, and 
others more, according as the Disease hath more or less seated and 
rivetted it self in the Body. 
 
[}The Stone or Gravel in the Kidneys.}] 
 
IF the Patients pain lye most, either in the Reins or the Flank, 
it is an Indication, whereby he or she may conclude, the Malady 
is the Stone or Gravel in the Kidneys; then the Patients age 
and strength of Nature admitting, let him, or her, take the full 
Dose, or three spoonfuls last at Night and first in the Morning, 
and presently after it use as much stirring exercise as may be, and 
although Riding may at that time be burthensome, yet it would 
prove very profitable and advantageous; for by using extraordinary 
exercises and agitations of the Body, divers have been the sooner 
discharged of this torturing distemper, as hath been experienced by 
Mr. Crawley (in the printed Sheet of those Drinks Virtues mentioned) 
who by taking but three spoonfuls of this Drink, and riding 
ten miles upon it, voided three Stones, each as big as a Horse 
bean, (as he himself testifieth.) 
 
[^p.4^] 
[}STONE in the Bladder.}] 
 
LET the Patient afflicted with the Stone in the Bladder, consider 
the bigness of it, and take the full Dose of three spoonfuls 
last at Night, and the like first in the Morning, continuing the 
same for three days; then intermit two days, and return to it, 
then taking only two spoonfuls last at Night, and the like Dose 
first in the Morning, which course let the Patient observe, and by 
the Lords Blessing, the Stone will be found to wast gradually, and 
in conclusion, to come away; but patience is to be exercised, for 
although Thomas Hinas voided away the Stone in nine spoonfuls, 
or three Doses taking, yet that great Stone voided by the said 
Mr. Crawley, was nigh twelve months in wasting, before it could 
come away, and was then rendered so soft, that it crumbled away 
between the fingers. 
 
[}Exulcerations of the Kidneys.}] 
 
FOR the Uxulceration of the Kidneys, rendering the Patients 
Urine like Blood: Let the Patient keep to the direction of the 
second general Observation, and so first open and clease the Body 
for two days; and then for two days, Night and Morning, take 
one spoonful or two (according to the measure of strength) and 
then intermit two days, and after, take one spoonful at night, and 
one in the Morning, and one an hour after dinner: This method 
in taking the same, hath, by the Lords Blessing, been found eminently 
successful in the healing and cleansing any Exulceration 
of the Reins or Bladder. 
 
[}Collick and Griping in the GUTS.}] 
 
LET the Patient (at any time of Pain) take 3 Spoonfuls, which 
may ease or mitigate the Pain; and if he or she be not discharged 
of the Pains, let him, or her, take three Spoonfuls more, 
Five Hours after; but if the Patient be a costive, or corpulent 
Body; let such a one take a Dose of 4 Spoonfuls in the Pain Fit, 
and (if the Pain continue) 4 Spoonfuls more six Hours after; 
for this Distemper is usually sadly violent, and must be followed 
close; and this Means (thus taken) fails not, by the Blessing of 
[^p.5^] 
Almighty God, to become Master of this sad Malady. Afterwards 
(for cleansing the Body of the Dregs of it) let the Patient 
lessen the Dose, according to Directions of the general Observations. 
 
[}PHTHISICK.}] 
 
LET the Patient weigh and consider the 3 general Observations, 
and (according to Direction thereof) open and cleanse the 
Body, for Four Days; and after that, take only Half a Spoonful, 
when the Cough is perceived coming upon him or her, and 
one Spoonful, an Hour before Dinner; and this Course (followed) 
will by degrees gain Power over, and waste the Distemper; yea, 
and strengthen Nature against it; and this Course may be taken. 
even in Winter, when the distemper is predominant and strongest 
upon the Patient; by which means, he or she will (by the Lord's 
Blessing) find the Breath free, and the Cough exceedingly abated, 
if not taken away: But as to youthful Persons, that are not far 
gone in this sad Malady, a Pint of this Drink in the Spring, and as 
much in the Fall (taken as before directed) will (by God's Blessing,) 
not fail of their perfect Cure. And unto aged People, afflicted 
with this Distemper, it doth so far aid Nature, and strengthen 
them, as in the following Winter to render their Lives pleasant 
to them; provided always, that the Patient be moderate in 
drinking, have a care to prevent taking cold and keep a good Diet. 
 
[}DROPSIE.}] 
 
IF it be predominant upon the Patient (known by the bigness of 
the Belly, swelling of the Limbs and Face) let the Patient take 
4 Spoonfuls first in the Morning, and the like Dose last at Night, 
for 4 Days together, then intermit 2 Days, and afterwards keep 
to 3 Spoonfuls at Night, and the like Dose in the Morning. 
 
[}SCURVEY.}] 
 
THE Scurvey, (known by knots in the flesh, and blue spots in 
the skin) let the Patients keep to the directions in the three 
general observations, having due regard to the strength of their 
bodies, and take the drink two days, intermitting two days, for 
the space of a month, and then take only one spoonful in the 
morning, and another an hour before dinner. 
 
[^p.6^] 
[}SURFEITS.}] 
 
LET the Patient take the ordinary Dose, of three spoonfuls at 
night, and three in the morning, for six times without intermission; 
and doubt not, but (by the Lord's blessing) the same will 
be found successful to his or her Relief and Cure, tho' the height 
of the distemper had brought the Patient very low, and nigh the 
gates of death: And I would advise others, and particularly such as 
are apt to drink much Wine (bad and sophisticated Wines being 
very frequent and fatal in this City and elsewhere) that they do 
upon the least illness and disposition of Body, apply themselves 
unto this choice Remedy, either the same night, or the 
next morning, or both; for this Drink is experienced a choice 
Antidote for preventing of Surfeits insensibly stealing upon men, 
and expelling out of the Body that malignant Matter, which is 
the occasion and rise thereof. 
 
[}PESTILENCE.}] 
 
LET the Patient, when first smitten with this Visitation, or with 
illness accompanied with any symptom of the Distemper (regard 
being had to the direction of the three general Observations) 
take three spoonfuls, or less, of this Drink (according to the Patients 
strength or weakness of Body) and so proceed as occasion 
shall require; and I question not, but (thro' Mercy) the same will 
be found an effectual means, as well for overcoming the Distemper, 
as for strengthening Nature, and restoring Health (unless the 
Patients Visitation be the Messenger of Death) as hath been happily 
experienced, and will be attested by divers persons in my 
own and other Families, which stay'd in the City in the time 
of the last great Visitation, and were Visited, and yet thro' God's 
Goodness do still remain in the Land of the Living. 
 
[}Fits of the Mother, and Vapours from the Spleen.}] 
 
LET the Patient (having regard to the direction of the general 
Observations) begin with one, or with two Spoonfuls of this 
Drink, and so continue and raise the Dose, according to what the 
Patients strength may admit, remembring that the greatest Dose 
[^p.7^] 
prescribed is not to exceed three Spoonfuls, and let the proper 
Dose be taken at any time whatsoever, when the Fit is found to 
be coming upon him or her. 
 
WHen Women, either by reason of taking Cold, or any other 
accident, find an Obstruction of their Flowers tho' it be 
in Child-bed, give them three spoonfuls of this drink at any time, 
(either at night or day) and thro' God's Blessing they will find 
all in good order again; of which excellent virtue, in this drink, 
divers Women, and my own Wife (when in Child-Bed) have 
found comfortable experience, aud will attest to others. 
 
[}GREEN-SICKNESS.}] 
 
LET the Patient duly observe the direction of the three general 
Observations, using as much stirring Exercise, as strength will 
permit; and in four days time, she will, by the Blessing of God, 
find her Distemper diminish, and in taking of an half pint Bottle, 
the Cheeks and Lips will return to their former Rose-colour. 
 
[}CHILDRENS Distempers.}] 
 
FOR CHILDREN'S DISTEMPERS, whether the Worms, 
Rickets, the Stone, Convulsions, Gripes, King's Evil, Joynt-Evil, 
or any Distemper proceeding from Wind or Crudities, gendred 
by means of undigested Matter, (the effect of their cold and 
weak Stomachs) which is the grand and original cause of these 
their distempers: The way of administring this drink must be 
on this manner; to a Babe of a Month old, give (in time of its 
affliction) half a Child's Spoonful thereof, mixed with double 
the quantity of small Ale, not exceeding this Dose, nor oftner 
than once in 12 hours time; To a Babe of half a year old, let the 
Dose be half a middling spoonful of the drink, with double the 
quantity of small Ale. To one of a year old, one spoonful, with 
the like quantity of small Ale. To a Child of four years, one 
spoonful of the drink alone. To one of seven years old, two 
spoonfuls; and to one of 12 years old, two spoonfuls and an 
half; in any of these Distempers, not exceeding one Dose in 12 
hours, except only in the Gripes, and then, one dose every five 
hours; where observe, that in most of these distempers it hath 
[^p.8^] 
pleased God so to bless this means, that two doses have been successful 
to Babes and Children's Cure: Here Note, that the strength 
of the Child, and of its distemper, will be a more sure Guide for 
appointing a proper Dose, than the Child's Age. 
 
[}The Stone in Babes and Children.}] 
 
AND if the Distemper by the Stone, observe the same directions 
in administring this Drink to Babes and Children, of all ages, 
as is above prescribed for those under other distempers; except 
only, that distemper of the Gripes; and this Drink gradually wasts 
the Stone, and turns Stones to Gravel, bringing them away as soft 
as Meal, and brings away Worms, as skins; it also brings away a 
slimy substance, some black, some green, (the cause of these distempers, 
which manifold experience hath fully confirmed. 
 
[}Convulsion Fits.}] 
 
MOreover it hath also been experienced, that unto a Child of 
seven Years old (afflicted with the Gripes or Convulsion Fits in 
extremity) there hath been found necessary the same dose, as for a 
Man, being three spoonfuls, and five Hours after, the like Dose. 
 
[}Consumptions, bad Digestions.}] 
 
LET Consumptive Persons, of either Sex, take one spoonful of 
this drink an hour before dinner, and another such dose, an 
hour after dinner; for many weak Consumptive persons have 
(through the Lords blessing) experienced the same very successful 
in strengthning weak Nature, converting their food into good 
nourishment, and instrumental in restoring their strength. 
 
[}Agues.}] 
 
LET the Patient (an hour before the expected time of the Fit) 
take three spoonfuls, being at what time soever; and two 
spoonfuls six hours after: (which done) let the Patient observe the 
Directions of the second general Observation. 
 
[}Piles.}] 
 
LET the person afflicted, diligently folly the Direction in the 
second general Observation; it having been lately found to be 
successful. 
 
[}FINIS.}]
