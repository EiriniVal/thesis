[}A BRIEFE DISCOVRSE 
OF THE MEDICINE 
called Mithridatium.}] 
 
WEe doe read in y=e= Romaine 
histories, that 
Mithridates a Puisante 
king of Pontus 
& Bithinia, for causing 
all y=e= Romaines 
in Asia to bee slaine, 
and the Proconsul 
Oppius to bee cast in 
prison, was assaulted by Silla, discomfited by 
Lucullus, and lastly vtterly vanquished by 
Pompey the great: and when this valiaunte 
king perceiued himselfe to be ouercome, and 
that he was to be taken of his enemies: first 
he destroyde his wyfe & daughters with poyson, 
and then tooke the same poyson, desiring 
rather so to dye, then as a captiue to fal into y=e= 
hands of his enemyes: But hauing dronken 
much of the poyson, could not dye therewith, 
and then caused his seruant Bistocus a frenchman 
(as it is written) to kill him with a 
sword. Such was the magnanimity of this 
mighty king to escape the hands of the Romaines, 
y=t= he might not bee caried to Rome, 
[^f.A2v^] 
and in captiue maner be shewed in triumph. 
For this noble king was not only valiante in 
warre, but also in phisicall matters very expert, 
had the knowledg of many hearbes, and 
making tryall of sundry simples that doe resist 
poyson in men condemned to dye, as Galen 
writeth in his first booke de Antidotis, and 
finding some to remedy y=e= poison of Spiders, 
some of Scorpions, some to doe good against 
the byting of Uipers, others of mad Dogs, 
many to remedy the poison of hearbes, and so 
sundry others to help the venime of sundry 
poisons: he endeuoured to make a mixture 
of diuerse simples, hoping thereby to haue a 
ready remedy against all kindes of poison, & 
the same was termed after his name Mithridatium: 
wherein he was nothing deceiued. 
For this noble king in his life time vsed much 
and often y=e= medicine. And (as it is written) being 
subdued by the Romaines, and making 
choise rather to dye then to be led captiue to 
Rome, attempting to kill him selfe with poison, 
and taking of it great quantity, tooke no 
harme thereof, for that his body (as y=e= history 
saith) by vse of y=e= medicine altered, & resisted 
the action of the poison. Notwithstanding 
his wife and two daughters dyed before 
his face with the same poison. Since that 
[^f.A3r^] 
time, the efficacy and strength of y=e= medicine, 
hath in all ages (euen vnto these our dayes) 
bene confirmed. For after that Pompey the 
great had co~quered this valiante king, search 
made in his Closets, amongst sundry Iuels, 
many secret medicines to expell diuerse poisons, 
and to cure other internall diseases, 
were founde: where also was the description 
of this medicine. And albeit Pompey, as a 
martiall man, had greatest care of other 
matters, yet aduertised what goodnes might 
come by such secret medicines, commaunded 
one Pompeius Lineus his libertine, well 
seene in sciences, to conuert all those medicines 
written in the Pontike tongue, into latine. 
And it doth appeare by the history, that 
many volumes of phisicall maters were there 
founde, which perused and considered of by 
Asclepiades, in those dayes a famous phisition 
in Rome, were by him commended, and at 
his petition translated into latine, whereof 
Pliny writeth in his 25. booke. Of so many 
excellent medicines left by Mithridates, none 
was so highly esteemed, & so well accompted 
of in all respectes, as that termed Mithridatium: 
whose excellent vertues against poison 
were first approued in Mithridates owne 
body, and after confirmed by y=e= Romaines. 
 
[^f.A3v^] 
In trueth a man may iustly blame the historyographers, 
which in describing the noble 
actes of Pompey the great, doe so slenderly 
passe ouer this his facte, in translating of this 
medicine experienced of this noble king. For 
in my iudgeme~t things iustly weighed, none 
of all Pompeyes valiante feates of armes, no 
not the royall triumph made at Rome to declare 
the victory in co~quering king Mithridates, 
hath so largely aduaunced his name, 
as the making knowen to the world of this 
medicine. For the profit of y=t= victory came only 
to Rome, and the triumph and praise for y=e= 
same done at y=t= time in Rome: But the profit 
of this medicine hath bene by his meanes imparted 
to y=e= whole world, & the co~mendation 
and praise for the same, is iustly to be yeelded 
from all the world in all ages and times: So 
that as all the world is greater then Rome, & 
all times more then one age, so doubtlesse 
more renowme is due vnto Pompey for diuulging 
of this medicine, then by the conquering 
of this king, or by the triumph for the 
same. Although in the Emperoure Nero his 
time, succeeded a learned phisition called Andromachus, 
who to the imitation of this medicine 
compounded an other, adding to the description 
of Mithridatium the flesh of Uipers, 
[^f.A4r^] 
and some other simples, which medicine 
he called Theriaca, of the Greeke worde 
[^GREEK OMITTED^], which doth signifie a wilde and venemous 
beast, whereof the Uiper is one. Yet 
this ought not to imbase any praise due to 
Mithridates for compounding of Mithridatium. 
For all men doe know that it is easier 
to adde to a thing done, then to finde out the 
same, and greatest praise is to be geuen to the 
first inuentor. So that the dishonour y=t= came 
to Mithridates by Pompey his victory was 
not so great, as the praise and commendation 
for the inuenting and compounding of Mithridatium. 
And his calamity to be ouerthrowen 
is greatly easied, his ignomy to be 
co~quered after a sorte aduaunced, that by the 
same this medicine was diuulged, which 
happely would not haue bene performed, at 
y=e= least so generally, had he dyed otherwayes, 
and not bene by Pompey ouercommed. For 
had not Mithridates in him selfe approoued 
the excellency of the medicine, purposing to 
haue killed him selfe rather then to come into 
the handes of the Romaines, surely the notable 
vertues of the medicine would not so 
well haue bene belieued. And had not this 
king in that his miserable estate made triall 
in his owne body, who would haue belieued 
[^f.A4v^] 
that a mans body might by any meanes be 
brought so strongly to resist poison; Who but 
one in so desperate a case, would attempt to 
take strong poison vpon the credit of any medicine; 
Great good therefore to the whole 
world this ouerthrowe of Mithridates did 
breede: And great renoume thereby came, 
not to the conqueroure onely, but to the conquered: 
to the one for inuenting, to the other 
for diuulging of so great a medicine, which 
for these two thousand yeares hath bene of all 
men in all ages had in great estimation, not 
in Pontus onely & Bithinia, & Greece adioyning 
to the same, but in all other nations and 
countryes where any learning is, commended 
by all writers, Grecians, Arabians, and 
Latinists. And what greater assurance can 
there be of the notable vertues of this medicine, 
then the confirmation of the same from 
Mithridates to this our time, then that all 
phisitions of the world in all ages, times, and 
places, in Greece, in Arabia, in Italia, in all 
partes of Germany, in France, in Spayn, in 
Portingal, in Hungaria, in England, in 
Scotland, Moscouia, Tartaria, Sueuia, yee 
in all partes of Asia, Aphrica, and Europa, 
euen amongest the saluage and barbarous nations, 
hath and doth greatly esteeme of Mithridatium, 
[^f.A5r^] 
and so of Theriacle, and seeke 
and prouide for them to serue their countryes 
in cases of neede. How carefully all princes & 
rulers, hath & doth take order for the well co~pounding 
of these medicines. Doubtles had 
not experience confirmed their excellent qualyties, 
the estimation would not haue so many 
yeares continued: but longe before this 
our age, would haue bene diminished, and by 
this time come to nothing. Great therefore 
are these medicines, and in a heigh degree to 
be esteemed. And albeit great prayse and co~mendation 
is due to both medicines (I meane 
Mithridatium and Theriacle) yet greatest 
praise is to be geuen to Mithridatium. First 
because of his antiquytie, which was of Mithridates 
inuented, & approued many yeares 
before Theriacle was compounded. For long 
after Mithridates was ouerthrowen, Andromachus 
phisition to Nero y=e= Emperour, & very 
expert in co~fecting of medicines) as Galen 
writeth in his first booke de Antid.) with 
diligence considering the composition of Mithridatium, 
chaunged some of the simples, 
toke out some, and added others, supposinge 
by that alteration to make the medicine more 
perfite, & of mightyer force against poison. In 
which consideration be added the flesh of vipers 
[^f.A5v^] 
to the composition of Mithridatium, 
and leauing out some simples vsed of Mithridates, 
added others, in number moe, and (as 
he thought) of greater power against poyson. 
Whereby it may reasonably bee gathered, y=t= 
Andromachus not fully satisfied with the co~position 
set downe by Mithridates, supposing 
some defect in it, by that his alteration, endeuoured 
to make an other medicine in all degrees 
more perfite, in which no want might 
be found, and so he addressed the same, and called 
it Theriaca. Whereby no doubt some 
good time after, Mithridatium was lesse esteemed, 
and the credit thereof much imbased, 
vntill time by longe experience had sufficiently 
declared, wherein Theriacle doth excell 
Mithridatium, and in what poynts Mithridatiu~ 
is not onely not inferiour to Theriacle, 
but of more efficacy then it. 
 
So Galen in his first booke de Antidot. 
writeth. Because of the flesh of Vipers in Theriacle, 
it is much better in the byting of the Viper 
then Mithridatium. But in all other effects, 
Theriacle can not onely not doe more then Mithridatium, 
but is inferiour. The same Galen 
in 2. de Antidot. writeth in like sorte. We will 
begin (saith he) with the description of Mithridatium, 
for it is stronger against many poisons 
[^f.A6r^] 
then Theriacle, though this be better against 
the byting of the Viper. Whereby we 
may gather y=t= where Andromachus endeuouring 
to make a more perfit medicine, then y=t= 
lefte of Mithridates, did in some part accomplish 
his purpose, leauing a medicine excelling 
the other in one particular thing, but not 
of like efficacy generally. It happened therefore 
in this case (if a man may compare natures 
actions to arte) as in y=e= framing of ma~, 
who doth in all actions exceede all creatures, 
yet not so generally, but y=t= in some one action 
some one beast doth excel man, as we reade y=t= 
the Ægle hath perfiter sighte then man, the 
Dogge doth passe man in smelling, the Ape 
in agility, the Tiger in swiftnesse. But whosoeuer 
will with reason conferre all actions, 
he shall find in all together, that man passeth 
all creatures, for such is his constitution and 
temperature, that moe and perfiter actions 
doe proceede from man the~ any one creature. 
So it came to passe, that Andromachus indeuoring 
to make a medicine of greater perfection 
then Mithridatium, obtayned that in 
one thing his medicine excelled, but in many 
other was inferiour to Mithridatium. For a 
man may gather the vertues of these two medicines, 
at large displaied in Galens workes, 
[^f.A6v^] 
into three orders. First that they are good 
against the byting and stinging of venemous 
beastes, be they Serpentes, Scorpions, mad 
Dogges, or others. Secondly they serue to 
cure all kinde of poysons taken into the body. 
Thirdly to remedy other inwarde diseases. 
Now it is certaine, and long experience hath 
confirmed, that both these medicines haue 
strong and mighty vertues to remedy al three 
kindes of effectes: yet no doubt one of them 
is in some effectes of more power then the other. 
As Galen writeth that Theriacle for y=e= 
byting of Uipers, is stonger then Mithridatium: 
In other it doth exceede Theriacle. 
So we may iustly conclude with Galen, that 
against the byting & stinging of beastes, Theriacle 
hath more force: But for inward poisons 
& inward diseases, truly Mithridatium 
is of more might. Wherefore albeit both medicines 
are noble, & greatly to be desired, yet 
Mithridatium is to be accompted of greater 
price, as hauing more generally stronger vertues, 
and seruing to moe purposes. 
And it may be obiected, that in Theriacle co~piled 
by Andromachus are many simples added, 
which haue great vertue against diuerse 
kindes of poysons, and happely are therein of 
more efficacy, then those in Mithridatium, 
[^f.A7r^] 
left out by Andromachus in his Theriacle. 
Whereby it may be coniectured, that Andromachus 
making choyse of the simples, selected 
such as were of greatest force to remedy 
poisons, & omitted the weaker, adding in their 
place, some other of more stre~gth: so it is probable, 
y=t= Theriacle so compiled, is of greater 
myght in all kinde of poysons. But Galen in 
his workes declareth, that experience in his 
time did shewe the contrary, and reason confirmeth 
the same. For let the simples in Theriacle 
be in number moe, and in qualytie of 
greater efficacy, yet it must be remembred, 
that it is certayn, that when in compositions 
some one simple is set as the base and ground 
of that medicine, that that simple doth drawe 
the force and strength of all y=e= rest to his property 
and action, and so euery such compound 
is specially good in that one thinge for which 
it was deuised. Now when Andromachus 
did make the flesh of vipers as the base and 
grounde of his Theriacle, it foloweth that the 
same doth drawe to it the qualities and vertues 
of all the simples in Theriacle: so it doth 
come to passe, that Theriacle is far better the~ 
Mithridatium, against the bytinge of vipers 
and such venemous beasts. And for that all other 
simples in it, are caried by the flesh of the 
[^f.A7v^] 
vipers, to exercyse their force strongly therin, 
they haue the lesse power to remedy other poisons. 
When no such thinge was intended in 
the composition of Mithridatium, it is agreable 
to reason that the simples in it euery 
one retayneth his owne power and property, 
and so one such quality or forme doth 
resulte by the myxture, of great strength against 
all poysons. Moreouer it is certayne 
that in the composition of Mithridatium, are 
fewer simples in number then are in the confection 
of Theriacle, then it followeth that 
when like quantity of both is taken, as for example, 
+Q j, surely a greater portio~ of euery 
one simple is taken in Mithridatium, and 
lesser in Theriacle, the lesser quantity must 
needes haue lesser strength in remedyinge other 
poysons, saue that, to the which the base 
or grounde doth call them. So it remayneth 
fyrme that Galen writeth, as obserued in his 
time, that Theriacle is in deede better then 
Mithridatium in bytinge of vypers and like 
beastes, and that Mithridatium exceadeth 
th' other in remedying all other poisons taken 
into the body and inward diseases. Wherefore 
in this our countrey where no such perill 
and danger is of vipers, Mithridatium by 
good reason ought to be reputed of greater estimation 
then Theriacle. 
 
[^f.A8r^] 
[}Of the composition of Mithridatium.}] 
 
IT shall not be amisse in this 
place, to declare the composition 
of this medicine. And 
it is to be noted, that where 
all writers doe greately co~mend 
it, yet certayne it is, 
that they do not in one sorte describe the makinge 
of the same. But almost euery authore 
hath a seuerall description, differinge in the 
number of the simples, and also in y=e= proportions 
and quantities. In time past y=e= Apothecaries 
in making of Mithridatium, folowed 
most the description of Nicolaus Prepositus, 
of Auicenna, and of Nicolaus Mirepsicus, 
some of Ætius, some of Paulus. The former 
descriptions contayninge aboue one hundred 
simples, were long and laborious, and required 
many supplyes, for simples vnknowen. 
Wherefore in these our later daies, in which 
learned men haue examined euery thing perfitly, 
the most part haue commended one of y=e= 
three compositions expressed by Galen in 2. de 
Antid. of the which, two were taken (as Galen 
wryteth) out of the bookes of Andromachus. 
The first found without name is attributed 
[^f.A8v^] 
to Andromachus, as compounded by 
him, of others supposed the very same, which 
was found in the closets of kinge Mithridates, 
& after transcribed in the workes of Andromachus. 
The second description is also 
recyted out of Andromachus bookes, vnder 
the names of Antipater and Cleophantes. 
The thyrd is referred to Damocrates: It doth 
not appeare by any thing written by Galen, 
which of these three compositions is best to be 
folowed. And so of y=e= learned men of our time, 
some hath vsed the one, and some the other. 
Many doe best like of the first description attributed 
to Andromachus, both for that Andromachus 
by the opinion of Galen and of all 
other auncient wryters, was adiudged very 
skilfull in co~pounding of medicines, & therein 
did farre excell all phisitions of his time, 
and also because it may bee iustly gathered, 
that that description is the very same, which 
Mithridates vsed. For in y=t= Andromachus 
was phisition to Nero the Emperour of 
Rome, it appeareth that he obtayned to see 
and to consider, of all the bookes which 
found in Mithridates closet, were translated 
into latine by Lineus the grammarian, and 
brought to Rome. And it is not agreable to 
reason, that Andromachus studying to make 
[^f.B1r^] 
a more perfit medicine then that which came 
vnder the name of Mithridatium, woulde 
also inuent an other vnder the same name. 
But it is very probable that Andromachus 
with diligence perusinge the recept of Mithridatium, 
vsed of Mithridates, would leaue 
it in such forme as Mithridates compou~ded 
it, and deuise an other by the same, which hee 
meant to make more perfite. Andromachus 
therefore not alteringe the description of Mithridatium, 
but leauing it in the same forme 
as it was founde, confected an other, which he 
called Theriaca. And where we doe reade in y=e= 
2. de Antid. of Galen, an other recept set 
downe vnder the name of Theriaca Mithridatis, 
with assertion that the kinge vsed the 
same: yet it seemeth not to be y=t= Mithridatium 
which was fou~d in the closet of that king. For 
all writers doe confesse, that Andromachus 
long after added to that recept of Mithridates, 
the flesh of vipers: so that Mithridatium 
compounded by Mithridates had not in it the 
flesh of vipers, and that Theriacle which Galen 
in that place calleth Theriaca Mithridatis, 
doth receaue the flesh of vipers, so it foloweth 
that it is not the Mithridatium vsed 
of Mithridates. And he that will with diligence 
peruse that recept mentioned of Galen, 
[^f.B1v^] 
by the name of Theriaca Mithridatis, shall 
finde it in y=e= simples not much differing from 
Theriaca Andromachi, and many things repeated 
twyse in diuers clauses doth argue an 
imperfection: that Galen may be thought in y=t= 
place to speake after y=e= common opinion, whe~ 
hee affirmeth it to be the same which Mithridates 
vsed, being in deede farre different 
from that medicine. Wherefore we may reasonably 
conclude, that the first recept transcribed 
by Galen in 2. de Antid. out of Andromachus 
workes, is in truth the selfe same 
that Mithridates vsed, and in mine opinion, 
in that respect the better to be liked, and the 
rather to be followed. For what better assurance 
can we haue of the true and perfect confection 
of this medicine, then that which was 
deliuered by Mithridates? and what description 
can more assure vs of the effects of this 
medicine, then y=t= composition which Mithridates 
followed, who first gaue so notable 
proofe of the medicine, and thereby the first 
credite to the same? So that if by discourse of 
reason it may be proued, that an other description 
is more artificiall and more agreable 
to the rules of confection of medicines: yet in 
mine opinion this description, being the same 
that Mithridates vsed, set downe happely by 
[^f.B2r^] 
the king, more according to experience then 
art, is rather to be folowed then any other, 
thought more cunningly addressed. Neuerthelesse 
it is not to be deemed that kinge Mithridates 
was altogether vnskylfull, when 
many volumes concerning phisike were found 
in his closet, & translated into latine, brought 
to Rome. And it appeareth that he taking 
delight in medicinall matters, had about him 
dyuerse phisitions, who mighte artificially 
dispence the simples in Mithridatium. And 
Galen in the sayd booke de Antid. commendeth 
the discription of Mithridatium attributed 
to Andromachus: whereby it appeareth, 
that this description of Mithridatium 
is not addressed altogether without arte. For 
which cause, y=e= learned of our time, haue great 
reason to preferre that description of Mithridatium 
before others. Albeit some do more 
esteeme the composition of Damocrates, as 
with more arte and more cunning dispensed. 
Notwithstanding because it is very likely y=t= 
the precept attributed to Andromachus, as 
found in his bookes, is the selfe same that 
Mithridates vsed, and hath of many, in this 
our countrey, of late yeares bene folowed: I 
thought best in this place to expresse y=e= same, 
as I doe finde it in Galen, in 2. de Antid. and 
[^f.B2v^] 
is in many antidotary bookes allowed, which 
is as foloweth.

BEcause many learned men of this age doe 
best allowe the description of Mithridatium, 
deliuered by Damocrates, as more artificially 
done, in which the rules of compounding 
of medicines are more exactly followed, 
and is in truth easier to be made of the Apothecaries, 
better digested in orders, not hauing 
so small diuisions in the proportions, as 
this attributed to Andromachus, and so may 
better be made of the Apothecary in what 
quantity shall seeme good to him: therefore 
[^f.B3v^] 
I doe thinke it not amisse in this place to recite 
that description also of Mithridatium of 
Damocrates, as the same is expressed in the 
second booke of Galen de Antidot. that such 
as shall thinke better to follow the same, may

of Mithridatium.}] 
 
[^f.B4v^] 
IT is of all men of our age co~fessed, 
and taken for a truth, 
that medicines compounded 
haue their vertues, and doe 
their effectes according to the 
nature of the simples whereof 
they are compounded. So it must needes followe, 
that Mithridatium compounded of many 
simples, hath diuers & sundry properties, & 
those agreable to the ingredience. And wheras 
in Mithridatium are simples differing in 
quality, some hauing power to heate, some 
other to coole, yet the greatest number are in 
quality whot and dry. And albeit these being 
contrary, and repugnant, do make alteration 
the one with the other: notwithstanding it 
must needes follow, that those reactions not 
being infinite, at the last one forme and quality 
must result in the compound, agreable to 
the natures of those simples, which doe beare 
and cary dominion. Now whereas in Mithridatium 
y=e= most simples haue quality to heate 
and dry: it followeth that Mithridatium 
hath a whot and dryinge power. And as compounds 
must haue a time of fermentation, and 
rypening (for the reactions of the simples are 
not perfited in a moment) So the quality or 
forme which doth aryse by the workinge of 
[^f.B5r^] 
one simple with an other, hath not his perfection 
presently after y=e= mixture, but a certayne 
space of time must be geue~ before we can iustly 
expect the true action of the medicine compounded, 
as proceeding from the forme of the 
medicine, which doth resulte by fermentation 
of the working of the simples in y=e= compound. 
So that before y=e= due time, we may not loke for 
the vertues aunswerable to the composition, 
but that some one simple aboue the rest may 
shew his quality, that the compound medicine 
may do an effect aunswerable to that simple, 
and not as proceeding from the whole co~position. 
In which respect, Galen wryteth that 
Theriacle newly made, doth greately prouoke 
sleepe, by reason that Opium (that is the ioyce 
of Poppy prepared) myngled in it, being of 
greater force then other simples, before fermentation 
doth exercise his quality more then 
the rest: and after that his quality is by fermentation 
with other simples broken, he can 
not so strongly do his operation. So Theriacle 
after the iust time of fermentation doth not so 
mightely prouoke sleepe, as newe Theriacle 
doth. The same is obserued in Mithridatium, 
and all other compounds, that immediately 
after myxture, the qualities of the simples 
are strongest, and shewe their powers 
[^f.B5v^] 
best. But certaine it is, that after due time of 
working, when the compound is fully rype, no 
one simple doth worke in it according to his 
owne nature, but by the reactions one common 
nature doth result, which cannot be attributed 
to any one or moe simples, but may 
be truely sayd a common nature arysinge out 
of all the ingredience, and from that forme the 
actions of the compound do proceede. Which 
forme is to vs not certainely knowen, y=e= effects 
are best learned by experience. Wherfore it is 
very wysely wrytten of Ioannes de sancto Amando 
in his exposition vpon the antitodary of 
Nicolaus, that it is better alwaye to vse a medicine 
compound exercised, then one lately inue~ted 
whereof we haue no experience. For although 
we may by discourse of reason gather 
that y=e= compound, as Mithridatium, is whot 
and dry, because y=e= simples wherof it is made, 
are the most part whot and dry, and then experience 
doth confirme this coniecture: yet other 
qualities of Mithridatium and of other 
compounds are not so easely knowen by any 
discourse or method, but chiefly learned by experience. 
For the co~mon forme from whence 
many secrete vertues doe procede, is not knowen 
by any learning or methode. So it must 
needes follow, that the actions of y=e= same forme 
[^f.B6r^] 
are not learned by methode or doctrine, but 
chiefly by experience. In which respect also, 
we haue reason to retaine the description deliuered 
by Mithridates, before any other, for y=t= 
that noble king gaue better proofe in himselfe 
of the vertues of the medicine, then any other 
hath of it by any other composition. 
 
[}That Mithridatium is not so whote as Theriacle, 
compounded after Andromachus description, 
which is in these dayes most 
followed: and that it may more 
safely bee vsed.}] 
 
Some learned men of 
our time, by reason go 
about to discourse, and 
prooue, y=t= Theriacle is 
not in qua~tity so whot 
as Mithridatium, & 
in that respect doe inferre, 
that it may more 
safely bee vsed. Which they doe gather, 
for that in Theriacle a greater quantity of 
Opium (that is the ioyce of Poppy prepared) 
is, then in Mithridatium, whose cooling 
power doth much abate the heating qualities 
of other medicines. This argument in these 
[^f.B6v^] 
two medicines newly made, before ferme~tation 
is perfite, may take place. For then in deede 
euery simple retayning his owne vertue, Opium 
may remitte the whot qualities of the rest: 
at what time neither of these medicines is generally 
to be vsed, but for some speciall point, 
as Galen to prouoke sleepe, doth counsell new 
Theriacle. But after fermentation is perfited, 
all the simples one altering the other, euery 
one hath qualities so broken, that not one 
retayneth his owne nature: then surely the co~mon 
forme resulting, doth follow the simples 
which doe beare dominion, and they in both 
these medicines are whot and dry, and y=e= whot 
and dry simples in Theriacle are moe in number, 
and of greater force, then in Mithridaiium: 
as may appeare to him that will compare 
both confections. Whereby it followeth that 
the common quality arysinge in Theriacle, 
doth heate more then that in Mithridatium. 
Neyther the increase of Opium doth in proportion 
aunswere the strength of heating in it: 
neither hath it any such force so greately to 
contemper the simples, as these men doe imagine. 
For although Opium hath speciall property 
aboue other medicines to induce sleepe, 
yet his cooling quality (of many writers) is not 
accompted so great, for it hath so strong bitternes: 
[^f.B7r^] 
that many doe suppose that it hath a myxt 
nature, consisting of many whot partes: if it 
be true that Galen wryteth in his 5. booke of 
simples, that all bitter thinges are whot, and 
being certaine y=t= Opium doth stupefy, & strongly 
cause sleepe, it is of some inferred y=t= that power 
doth rather proceede of a property of substaunce, 
then altogether depend of his cooling 
quality. Wherefore it is not without reason 
affyrmed by learned men wryting hereof, that 
Mithridatium doth not so strongly heate as 
Theriacle: and experience doth also confirme 
the same. For who so vseth these medicines, 
doubtles he shall finde that Theriacle rightly 
compounded after Andromachus description 
(which is in all this treatise to be vnderstood, 
and is in these dayes of the Apothecaries most 
commonly made, and so of the wyser sort in 
most vulgare vse) doth heate more then Mithridatium, 
which is confessed of the wryters, 
commenting vpon the antidotary of Nicolaus, 
and in this our age of many learned 
men affyrmed. For which cause, many in these 
dayes without daunger do vse Mithridatium 
when neede requireth. In so~mer time, & whot 
seasons, very few and seldome Theriacle. And 
Galen doth expresly forbyd to gieue Theriacle 
to children. More safe therefore is the vse of 
[^f.B7v^] 
Mithridatium then of Theriacle, not onely in 
respect of the heating quality, which seemeth 
lesse, & more gentle in Mithridatium: but also 
in respect that a greater quantity of Opiu~ 
is in Theriacle. For admit that Opium by fermentation 
sustayneth great alteration, notwithsta~ding 
y=e= common forme of Theriacle taketh 
some infection of Opium, y=t= some effecte 
declining to his nature, doth also proceede, 
and the more, if that stupefying and dormitory 
power in Opium, doth depend rather of property 
of substance, the~ of manifest cooling quality, 
as some do argue. For the properties of 
substance in medicines, haue not like alteration 
by fermentation, as the manifest qualities 
haue by reaction: we may therefore feare the 
common and often vse of Theriacle for y=e= quantity 
of Opium in it. For like reason, often vse 
of Theriacle may be suspected, because of the 
flesh of vipers added to it, as the base & grou~d 
of the medicine. For notwithstanding y=e= great 
care of the place, of the time, of the kinde obserued 
in taking and choosing of the viper, the 
diligence in preparing, the care of myxture 
with other things, for the better correction of 
the malignity of y=e= beast, which hapely might 
remaine in the flesh: yet a man may doubt of 
some errour co~mitted, in so dau~gerous a case. 
[^f.B8r^] 
And though all thinges therein bee ryghtely 
done, yet some little quality of the nature of y=e= 
beast will remayne, that a man may suspect 
often to vse the medicine. And where kinge 
Mithridates was expert in phisicall matters, 
it is not to be adiudged but that he did aswell 
know the nature of the flesh of vipers, as hee 
knewe the venime of the beast: so it is very 
likely that he purposing to compounde a medycine 
to be often taken for his safty against 
poison, did of purpose make it without the 
fleshe of vipers, knowing that if he shold haue 
added that, he myght not with like safty haue 
dayly vsed y=e= same. And what learned men doe 
so often in these dayes counsell Theriacle, as 
do Mithridatium? and we doe in this our time 
with lesse daunger and more security, for the 
measels, the smale pockes, the wormes, and for 
internal diseases in children, geue Mithridatium 
then Theriacle. We may therefore in 
mine opinion iustly conclude, that Mithridatium 
is a medicine more generally to be vsed, 
& may oftener and with more safty be geauen 
then Theriacle. 
 
[}Of the age and keeping of 
Mithridatium.}] 
 
[^f.B8v^] 
Wwhere we haue sufficiently declared 
that compounde medicines 
must haue a time of fermentatio~ 
before they be brought 
to vse: this place requireth that 
we doe declare the tyme, when Mithridatium 
is sufficiently fermented and come to his perfection. 
Galen in his bookes de Theriaca doth 
write exactly of the time of fermentation of 
Theriacle, affirming that it is throughly concocted 
in xii yeares, not denying but y=t= it hath 
concoction in shorter time, as in 5. and in 7. 
yeares, so that we are to iudge that Theriacle 
is not sufficiently ripe to bee vsed before fiue 
yeares, and in 7 yeares is better digested, & in 
xij yeares hath his full fermentation, and perfect 
concoctio~. Yet Ætius and Paulus Ægineta 
doe measure the concoction of Theriacle in 
shorter time. For Ætius sayth that Theriacle 
is fermented in xij monethes, and that it may 
be vsed after one moneth in some cases, and so 
affirmeth that it endureth to thirty yeares. 
Where Paulus appointeth y=e= age of Theriacle 
to be twenty yeares, therein he doth not greatlye 
differ from Ætius: for hee making the 
terme of Theriacle to be 30 yeares, doth also 
say that then it is good in light diseases. So 
that by Ætius, Theriacle may be vsed after xij 
[^f.C1r^] 
monethes, and continueth in good perfection to 
20. yeares, and after declineth, that at 30. yeares 
it is aged, yet may it be vsed in deseases which 
are not very great. Our later writers doe generally 
better allowe of Ætius & Paulus opinion 
for the age of Theriacle, then of Galens: 
and some suppose an errour or fault in y=t= place 
in Galen: and so they doe affirme y=t= Theriacle 
is fully concocted in the space of xij monethes, 
and then may bee sold of the Apothecary: and 
that the same being well kepte, will continue 
in good strength 20. yeares, and after doth decline 
and waxe weaker, and yet may be vsed 
when it is 30. yeares olde, but it is then as an 
old man decayed, and weake of strength. 
Of Mithridatium the former writers haue 
set downe no time of concoction, leauing to a 
wyse man to determyne of y=t=, which is written 
accordingly of Theriacle. For bycause these 
two medicines are confected of many simples, 
not greatly differring, they haue many things 
co~mon: so as y=t= which is of y=e= one affirmed, may 
bee applied to the other. Notwithstanding as 
in the number & nature of y=e= simples, they doe 
not in all poynts agree: so no doubt in y=e= age of 
these medicines some difference is to be allotted: 
yet such, as a man exercised in these matters, 
may easely supplye. For in that Theriacle 
[^f.C1v^] 
hath in it the flesh of vipers, and a greater 
portion of Opium, then is in Mithridatium, it 
is certaine that Theriacle requireth a longer 
time to his concoction: for the flesh of vipers 
must haue perfect fermentation with the simples 
for his correction. In like sorte Opium 
doth aske a long time of fermentation, & for y=t= 
cause Galen .12. de Method. Medend. saith, y=t= 
Philonium is not to bee vsed in a yeare after 
it is compounded, and that the vse of it after 
ij. iij. or iiij. yeares, is more without daunger. 
Whereby hee geueth vs to vnderstande, that 
medicines which doe receaue Opium, require 
longe time of fermentation: so that Theriacle 
receauing a greater portion of Opium 
then Mithridatium, ought to haue a larger 
space to be concocted, then it. Now if Theriacle 
hath his perfection in one yeare, surely 
Mithridatium is throughly fermented in sixe 
monethes, and may be kept in good strength, 
not only as some haue writen to three, or foure 
yeares, but to x or xij yeares: and except we 
shall to such time proroge his olde age, there 
will be no proportion in y=e= times. For if Theriacle 
being cocted in one yeare, doth last to 20. 
yeares before it doth waxe olde, suerly by the 
lyke proportion, Mithridatium not well fermented 
vnder six monethes, may iustly be said 
[^f.C2r^] 
to co~tinue in good efficacy to 10. or 12. yeares. 
And as Theriacle after 20. yeares waxeth old & 
feeble: so Mithridatium after 10. or 12. yeares 
doth decline, that being 20. yeares old, is then 
decayed and of litle force. As we may probably 
determine these times, so there can be no 
certainty set to leade vs to the time. For if the 
simples be not in good perfection, or the same 
orderly and well according to art compou~ded, 
or otherwayes the medicine not well kept: 
then it will sooner wax old, & lose his strength. 
But as Galen writeth, to these great medicines, 
great care must be had of the choise of y=e= 
simples, that they may be had in y=e= readiest perfection. 
And like dilige~ce must be gieuen, that 
the confectioner may in all pointes doe his duty, 
not in making only, but also in keeping y=e= 
medicine. And therefore princes are greatly to 
bee commended, which doe by theyr authority 
prouide, that these medicines myght be well 
ordered. And for that many doe in these dayes 
procure Mithridatium, to haue it in their 
houses ready to vse, it is good to know y=t= it is 
best kept in vessels of glasse, of siluer, and of 
gold, and that it is not so good to keepe y=e= same 
in Tinne vessels, for that they are often corrupted 
with ledde, and gather a ceruse matter, 
as Galen writeth in his first booke de Antid. I 
[^f.C2v^] 
wish therefore that the marchaunts may hereof 
be admonished, which doe commonly bryng 
Theriacle from Venice, in vessels of ledde, 
wherby no small dau~ger may grow in so noble 
a medicine, & so greatly esteemed. So wee 
must not fill the vessell to the toppe, as we say 
brime full, but leaue some reasonable space, 
for the medicine to worke, to exhale, & breath: 
and for that cause, Galen counsayleth to open 
the vessell somtymes. 
 
[}Howe to knowe good Mithridatium.}] 
 
WEe doe read in y=e= booke of Galen 
de Theriaca ad Pisonem, & 
in his bookes de Antidot. how 
diligently hee labored to gieue 
certen notes and rules, how a 
man might know the goodnes 
of Theriacle, and when the same was perfit: 
and so did in those his workes set downe both 
rules and proofes thereof. So carefull in old 
time wryters were, that wee might be assured 
of the goodnes of these noble medicines, seruing 
in so great affectes, and in such common 
vse. But such is y=e= malice of many which seeke 
gaine, that of the greater price a thinge is, the 
more sophistication they vse in it: y=t= if meanes 
were not declared, to discerne the good from 
[^f.C3r^] 
the bad, the sophisticated from y=e= true: no man 
might assure himself of the certaintie of any 
thing in estimation. It is therefore very necessary, 
to shew how men may know when Mithridatium 
is good and perfite, and when the 
same is naught & corrupted. And for y=t= Galen 
in his foresaid bookes, hath labored to declare 
this in Theriacle, we will apply the same to y=e= 
examination of Mithridatium. For in y=t= these 
medicines haue a great affinitie, they doe in 
most thinges so concurre, that y=e= same which is 
said of y=e= one, may be applyed to y=e= other. First 
therefore in consistence of substance, if Mithridatium 
be well and artificially compounded, 
it ought to haue an equality of substance, not 
drie nor ouer liquide, and moyste, not to arise 
in clots and lumpes, but it must be in substance 
coherent, equall, and smooth. In smell 
it must rese~ble the simples whereof it is made, 
and yet not to offer to the nose, the smell of any 
one simple aboue the rest, but to yelde a common 
odoure arising by fermentation of all the 
simples, not peculier to any one, nor vngratefull, 
but answerable to the ingredience, resembling 
no rottennes, nor mustines. 
In like sort, the taste must not expresse any one 
simple, but be as a common sapore, resulting of 
all the simples: so that if in tasting of Mithridatium, 
[^f.C3v^] 
you may manifestly discerne or discry 
any one simple in it, surely that Mithridatium 
is not well confected. Therefore it may not 
haue in it any excesse of vngratefull bitternes, 
which doth sometimes happen, when the confectioner 
doth either take hony ouerold, or 
boyle y=e= same ouermuch. So it may not shew 
to the taste any sowrenes, which happeneth if 
the wyne vsed be not well chosen, or not well 
handled in the compounding. 
 
It seemeth that Andromachus in his Theriacle 
had a great care of the coloure of it, and 
for that cause only (as some do write) did adde 
vitreoll prepared, to yelde to it an exact blacknesse. 
But Mithridates attending rather the 
goodnes, then by coloure to please y=e= eye, had 
no such care of the coloure, and so is thought 
to put nothing into Mithridatium to gieue it 
any fresher coloure then the simples woulde 
yeelde. Notwithstanding Mithridatium truly 
made, hath his coloure conuenient arising of 
the simples, which ought to be a little rednes 
declining to yealownesse, which coloure, after 
due fermentation, doth appeare with some 
freshenes, & by time in keeping, the same doth 
decline to an obscure darknes. Although at y=e= 
first it may be thought hard to iudge of Mithridatium 
by these signes, yet after a man 
[^f.C4r^] 
is exercised in often vewing, tasting, and smelling 
of Mithridatium, his sauoure, coloure, & 
taste will be so familiar, that a man shall quickly 
discerne the true from the mingled, the sophisticated 
from the right compou~ded. A man 
therefore that wil iudge herein, must often see, 
taste, and smel to Mithridatium, vntil his senses 
bee throughly acquainted with the qualities 
of the medicine, and then hee shall not bee 
easely deceaued. 
 
For better certainty of the perfection and 
goodnesse of Theriacle, Galen doth mention 
of certaine experiments to be made for triall 
thereof: as to gieue the same to such as haue 
ben either hurt externally by some venimous 
beaste, or haue taken inwardly some poison. 
Whereof princes haue made trial in co~demned 
persons, casting the~ to vipers, or gieuing 
vnto them some strong poyson, & after causing 
them to take of Theriacle the quantity 
of a nutte: and experience declared, that 
such as tooke Theriacle escaped the venime 
of the poyson, and they which tooke it not, dyed. 
Which proofe experienced in Theriacle, 
may also be applied to the triall of Mithridatium, 
and in that by all auncient writers Mithridatium 
is reputed of greater force then 
Theriacle, in curing all poysons inwardly taken: 
[^f.C4v^] 
It followeth, that if it be good and truly 
made, it must remedy such as haue taken 
poison into the body. And because co~mon 
persons haue not like oportunity to make this 
experiment in men co~demned, as princes haue: 
therefore we may in other beasts (as in dogs, 
in cokes and hennes, being domesticall creatures) 
experience the same, geuing to these 
beasts some poison, and after Mithridatium: 
and if the beast doe take no harme by the poison, 
we may be assured of the goodnesse of the 
medicine. And y=e= like is to be expected, if you 
gieue the remedy before the poyson be taken. 
For the medicine doth not onely defend the body 
from the venime of the poison, after it is taken: 
but also preserue, if it be first vsed: as we 
read of king Mithridates. In like maner Ætius 
biddeth vs to gieue to a doue, to a henne, or 
to a dogge, the quantity of two scruples of 
Opium, and straight after to minister to the 
same, Mithridatium, dissolued in some liquore, 
and if it be good and pure, the beaste 
shall sustaine no harme by the Opium. 
 
Galen deliuereth as a certaine signe of the 
perfect goodnes of Theriacle, to gieue it to 
one that hath taken a purgatiue medicine. 
For (saith he) if it be perfect good, the medicine 
will not purge at all: if after the taking 
[^f.C5r^] 
of Theriacle, y=e= medicine doth his operation, & 
purge neuerthelesse: surely then y=t= Theriacle 
is vnperfect, & not good. We do not read this 
signe applied to Mithridatium: yet I see no 
cause but y=t= we may proceede in like maner to 
try y=e= goodnes of it. For it is certaine y=t= no one 
simple is in y=e= co~position of Theriacle (which 
may be sayd to stay y=e= working of y=e= purgatiue 
medicine) which is not in Mitrhridatiu~. For 
where Theriacle doth abou~d with y=e= flesh of vipers, 
put as the base of the medicine, no wryter 
hath attributed to y=t= parcell any such property. 
The like may be sayd, if you discourse 
through all the simples added to this confection 
of Theriacle, and not in Mithridatium. 
Therefore it seemeth most agreeable to reason, 
that the property to stay the working of a 
purgation, doth proceede from the common 
forme of Theriacle: and so we may with like 
reason expect the same effect in Mithridatidatium, 
and rather in Mithridatium, because 
all writers doe confesse that it is of greater 
force for inwarde poisons, and inward affects, 
then Theriacle. Therefore I may co~clude, that 
Mithridatium gieuen after a purgatiue medicine, 
will better stay or diminish y=e= working 
thereof, then Theriacle: and our experience 
in common practise, doth confirme the same. 
[^f.C5v^] 
For in this our age, who doth after purgatiue 
medicines (to bridle their ouerworking) so 
often gieue Theriacle, as Mithridatium? 
Wherfore no doubt we may make triall of y=e= 
perfection and goodnes of Mithridatium, in 
like sorte as Galen writeth of Theriacle, that 
is to say, to minister to one a purgatiue medicine, 
and after to gieue to the same man a reasonable 
quantity of Mithridatium: and if the 
medicine doth not worke according to his nature, 
or that his operation be lesse the~ it ought 
to be, surely that Mithridatium is very perfect 
and good. Otherwyse, if y=e= medicine doth 
proceede in his action to purge, and the same 
appeareth not diminished by the taking of 
Mithridatium, then we may greatly doubt of 
the goodnes of the Mithridatium. 
 
[}How we may make good Mithridatium. 
in these dayes.}] 
 
I am not ignorant that diuers later writers 
do constantly affirme that in this our time we 
cannot make either good Theriacle or good 
Mithridatium, for that they say we do lacke 
many simples going into their compositions, 
and must vse others to supply, and so may iustly 
doubt whether y=e= supplies doe in all points 
[^f.C6r^] 
aunswere the true simples, and they which we 
haue are brought from farre cou~tryes, long 
iournies, some by la~d, some by sea, especially to 
vs in England, whereby they may be thought 
greatly weakned, and to loose much of their 
strength and vertues, before we haue them. 
So they conclude, that we cannot by any diligent 
meanes, make these medicines in that 
perfection as the auncient writers did, and so 
we may not so exactly looke for the effects of 
these medicines promised by the olde writers. 
Whereto it may bee sayd, that in parte this 
allegation is true, and in deede a fewe yeares 
past, when this fault was found, it was more 
truer then now it is. For in truth when good 
learning began to spring after barbarisme, 
the~ in deede great was y=e= wa~t of true simples, 
not in these two medicines only, but in many other 
moe. But now in this our time all things 
are called to a better examination, and it is certain 
that few simples are now lacking, namely 
to y=e= making of Mithridatium: and it is also 
euident y=t= the care of phisitions and of y=e= Apothecaries 
(I meane of y=e= better sort) is so honest 
and so great, y=t= they doe not only diligently 
procure from y=e= places (where the simples 
which goe to the compositions of these medicines 
do grow) the very true: but also prouide 
[^f.C6v^] 
that the same may in those cou~tries be gathered 
out of conuenient places, in due times and 
seasons. And y=e= help of so many and great nauigations 
into forrain dominions (more in these 
our dayes vsed, then of longe time before vs) 
doe gieue so good oportunity to haue true and 
good simples, y=t= to say truly what I do thinke 
of this our age, I doe verily belieue that we 
haue as true and as good simples, as Galen 
had in his time: especially such as are requisite 
to the making of Mithridatium. For 
we do reade what a dooe Galen made to haue 
pure and good Cinnamum, and made it an 
Emperoures worke to procure the same, and 
in lacke of Cinnamum did sometimes substitute 
double qua~titie of Casia. Whosoeuer wil 
with diligence examine the sackes of Canella, 
brought from the new found cou~tries in great 
plenty in these dayes, may easely finde the perfect 
kindes of Cinnamum, agreable to the description 
of y=e= old wryters: & also the true Casia. 
We may also vndersta~d, how in old time 
things were sophisticated by the monume~ts of 
old writers. And who doth not now perceaue 
and acknowledg many errors in Dioscorides 
bookes, in deliuering the descriptions of simples, 
not so well knowe~ in his time, as now by 
these nauigatio~s made manifest; Many things 
[^f.C7r^] 
written by the auncient authors, by hearesay, 
are now to the eye made euident and knowen. 
Wherefore it is true y=t= now in this age things 
are so exactly examined, & so diligently sought 
for, and so painfully cared for: that in truth I 
doe suppose we may make in this time Mithridatium, 
in very good perfection: and the simples 
wanting, are few in number: y=e= substitutes 
for the same, by learned men so well considered 
of, & so aptly appointed: that we neede not so 
greatly to doubt thereof, but may iustly expect 
th' effects attributed to the medicine, if not in 
so large manner as the auncient writers haue 
deliuered, yet in such resonable sorte, y=t= we may 
esteeme of the medicine, as of a precious iewel, 
as of a thing good against some drie poisons, & 
diuers internall and pestilentiall diseases. 
 
[}Mithridatium made in England is rather 
to bee chosen, then that which is 
brought from Venice and other 
countryes beyond the 
Sea.}] 
 
SOme haue ben of opinion, that Theriacle & 
Mithridatium may better be made in other 
countryes, (as namely at Venice, and Constantinople) 
then in England: affirming that 
[^f.C7v^] 
moe and better simples are growing there, 
which wee doe lacke: and that such simples 
which are found neither in these countreys, 
nor in England, but are procured from y=e= east 
and west Indians, do sooner and in better perfection 
come to those places, then to vs. Surely 
if things be rightly weighed, this allegation 
is not true. For the partes of Italy, and the 
territories about Constantinople, haue very 
few or no simples growing in their soyles, 
which do not spring in England, required to 
the composition of Mithridatium, and many 
are founde in England in better perfection 
the~ there. As namely, who doth not graunt the 
best saffron to be in England, & all trauelers 
which come into England, do confesse that our 
soyle doth produce very good plantes (as 
namely Scordium) in better kinde than other 
countreys: and some strangers do send into 
England often for some of our simples, which 
do go into the composition of Mithridatium. 
It is also well knowen, that straunge herbes 
transplanted hither, and some of seedes sowen, 
doe very kindely spring in England, which is 
also confessed of some later writers in theyr 
Herballes. And where few simples requisite 
to make Mithridatium are wanting (as not 
growing in England) it seemeth most true, 
[^f.C8r^] 
that they which doe growe here, are most 
kindly for vs (for natiue things are best aggreable 
to our constitutions.) So y=t= whereas the 
most simples in number required to the composition 
of Mithridatium, are found naturally 
to spring in England: I see no cause why 
we should not best allow of it made heere: neither 
ought y=e= paucitie which we do lacke, to 
draw vs better to esteeme of a forrayne medicine 
made of all forrain things. And as I dare 
affirme that in this countrey we do lacke as 
few simples which go to the making of Mithridatium, 
as any of the forenamed places: so 
I may iustly pronounce, that such which are 
wanting to them, and to vs also, may and are 
as easily, and in as short time transported to 
vs, as to them. For in these dayes, the spices 
and other thinges brought from y=e= Indians by 
nauigation to Lishburn, and thence to other 
cou~treys of Europe, may as soone be transported 
to vs as to Venice. Where in times past 
such marchandise were caried from the east 
Indians to Alexandria by land vpon Camels, 
that trade is now decayed, and for y=e= most part 
such drugges are imported by sea, and y=e= ships 
doe commonly light in some part of Portingal: 
so that it is easie to see that our Apothecaries 
in England, may with as good conueniency 
[^f.C8v^] 
procure the~ from those places, and in as 
good perfection, as the marchau~ts of Venice 
or of Constantinople. Neuerthelesse if any 
thing lacking with vs, doe come to Venice: it is 
soone transported thence to Antuerp (as in the 
space of 24. dayes) & so to vs. Wherefore I doe 
not co~ceaue, why any man should thinke y=t= our 
Apothecaries in England, ca~not make Mithridatiu~ 
in as good perfection as other cou~tries 
doe: but rather we ought to adiudge y=e= contrary, 
that it made here, is in as good perfection, 
and more agreable to our natures & constitutions, 
then y=t= which is co~pounded in other countreys, 
as altogether made of strau~ge simples, 
which haue no affinity with our bodies. And if 
we do with iudgement co~sider how vncertaine 
wee are of the true confection, when it is done 
in places so farre from vs: it may make vs 
greatly to feare, least they which do co~pound y=e= 
medicine, hauing more care to gaine, then truly 
to dispence y=e= same, will neither make choise 
of the best simples, neither vse diligence in the 
mixture. And if the princes of the countryes 
with carefull lawes prouide, that the confectioners 
shall doe their duties truely, in compou~ding 
and obseruing the things needeful to the 
well handling of so noble a medicine: who can 
assure himselfe of the truth of the marchaunt 
[^f.D1r^] 
in transporting y=e= same; whose profession is by 
his marchaundize to gaine, & so no doubt will 
vse meanes euery way to increase his profite, 
that we may iustly suspect, that they doe very 
seldome bring into England from Venice 
or Constantinople, any Theriacle or Mithridatium 
vnmingled: & the better skill they haue 
in their trade, with more arte they can sophisticate 
their waxes, to deceaue the iudgement 
of the buyer, that I greatly doe doubt y=t= litle 
or none at all of these medicines are brought 
true and sincere vnmixed: as hath bene tryed 
when straungers in England haue purposly 
examined both Theriacle and Mithridatium 
compounded in London, with other brought 
from the sayd countryes, & haue gieuen praise 
to that made in London: as maister Hughe 
Morgane her Maiesties Apothecary can witnes, 
whose confections haue bene better commended 
by strangers, then any of other places. 
Farther whereas of Mithridatium there are 
diuers descriptio~s, not all of like goodnes (as 
I haue before declared) how can we tell what 
compositions the confectioner followed; hereof 
y=e= marchau~t not hauing care, can not informe 
vs: so we remaine vncertaine of the true knowledge 
of the medicine, not hauing knowledg of 
the simples vsed in that wee buy: and as wee 
know not assuredly what kinde of Mithridatium 
[^f.D1v^] 
we doe buy: so we remaine vncertaine of 
the medicine: And where wee haue declared y=e= 
Theriacle & Mithridatium haue their times 
of fermentation, of their duraunce, and that 
after a certaine age they decline, waxe old, & 
feeble: we cannot know the time of that which 
is forraine made: so we haue vncertaine medicine, 
and shall be vncertaine how long we may 
keepe the same. All which circumstances may 
be easly knowne, in that which is made in England. 
Galen in his bookes doth not allowe 
of Theriacle kept in Tinne vessels, affirming 
that they are corrupted with ledde, the ceruse 
whereof doth corrupt y=e= medicine. What shall 
we then say to our marchauntes, which doe 
bring Mithridatium & Theriacle from other 
countryes in vessels of ledde? doe not these 
medicines take of y=e= vessels great corruption, 
and notwithstanding are solde to the great annoyance 
of the Queenes subiects? Wherefore 
if we doe truely weigh in the ballance of reason, 
that which I haue here written) and yet 
much more may in this matter be sayd) surely 
we shall not onely confesse that none of these 
medicines, specially Mithridatium, made in 
forraine places, are, or ought to be so greatly 
esteemed, as those which are made at home in 
England. And we may truely confesse that we 
[^f.D2r^] 
are iustly punished in expending our money vpon 
forraine things, when we haue & may haue 
better at home. And it is very lamentable to 
consider, y=t= straungers doe dayly send into England 
a false & naughty kinde of Mithridatium, 
& Threacle, in great barrelles, more then a 
thousand weight in a yeare, and vtter y=e= same 
at a lowe price, for iij. d. or iiij. d. a pound, to y=e= 
great hurt of Her Maiesties subiects, and no 
smale gaine to straungers purses. Wherefore 
to conclude, I do counsell all English men rather 
to buy Mithridatium truly made in England, 
then that which is brought from other 
cou~tryes. And here it is to be wished, that our 
most gratious Soueraigne thereof informed, 
may by Her magistrates doe, as in olde time 
Emperoures of Rome did, that is, by her edict 
take order, that our Apothecaries may 
with care and diligence select the simples 
which doe go to the making of this medicine, 
that the true may bee gotten in their best perfections, 
and the same truely chosen may bee 
rightly dispensed, and in all pointes according 
to arte well ordered, the time of fermentation 
duely obserued, the maner of keeping, in good 
sorte performed: and so all things rightly administred 
by her Maiesties carefull ordinaunces, 
I doe not doubt, but y=t= wee shall in this 
[^f.D2v^] 
our countrie haue both Mithridatium & Theriacle 
in good perfection, that we may finde 
the great effects and noble vertues of both, so 
largely deliuered by the auncient writers in 
their monuments.
