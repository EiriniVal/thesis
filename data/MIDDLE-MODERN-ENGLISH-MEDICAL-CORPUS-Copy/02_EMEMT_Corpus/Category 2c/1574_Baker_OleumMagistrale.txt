[}The composition of the Oyle 
called Oleum Magistrale inuented 
by one named Aparice.}] 
 
FIrst you shall take 
a quarte of the best and 
oldest white wine y=t= may 
be gotten, Oil Olif of the 
oldest iij. pound then put 
therto these floures & herbs folowing, to 
wit. The floures and leaues of Hipericon 
half a P. Cardus benedictus, a quarter 
of a P. Valerian a quarter of a P. of the 
least Sage a quarter of a P. of euery one 
of these you shall take the leaues & flowers 
if it be possible. Then let all these 
steep xxiiij . houres in the aforesaid wine 
and Oile, the next day boile them in a 
nealed pot or in a copper vessel, vpon a 
soft fire vntil such time as the wine be al 
consumed, alwaies stirring it with a 
Spattle. 
 
After you haue thus doon: take it from 
the fire and strain it, and to the strayning: 
put a P. and a half of good Venice 
Turpentine, then boile it again vpon a 
soft fire the space of a quarter of an houre, 
then ad therto Olibanum v. vnces, 
Mirrah iij. vnces. Sanguis draconis. one 
[^f.1v^] 
vnce, and so let it boil til the Ince~ce and 
the Mirrah be dissolued, then take it of 
and let it stand til it be colde, then put 
it into a glasse Bottle and set it viij. or 
x. dayes in the Sun and keep it to your 
vse. 
 
[}The maner to apply the saide 
Oyl according to the qualities of the 
vvounds or diseases, dooth consist 
in these vi. things folowing.}] 
 
[}To the patient, to the preparatife, to 
the wound, or disease, to the plaister 
and to the diseased parte.}] 
 
FIrst the hurted and afflicted partie 
must vse this Regiment folowing, 
that is to say, to keep no 
straight diet, neither in eating nor drinking 
for fear of weakning the body and 
hindring of his helth. So that he may 
eat and drink, as he was accustomed to 
doo before he was hurt. As for example, 
he may eat to his dinner new laid Egg~, 
Mutton, wilde foule of the woods, principally 
when they haue bled, and likewise 
at night ye may roste any of these, and 
if he were accustomed to eat grose meat~ 
in his helth, as Porke, Onions, Garlick 
[^f.2r^] 
and such like, he need not to forbere them 
but to vse them according as his apetite 
wil serue him and also to drinck wines, 
if he haue vsed them before he was hurt. 
 
Yet neuertheles if he be a body filled 
with humours, and giuen to a Feuer or 
any other inconuenience: he must vse 
his meats and drincks with discretion, 
and if he drinck any wine it must be delayed 
with water. Notwithstanding 
Aparice did neuer forbid any kindes of 
meats to his patients which they were 
accustomed to vse in their helth. 
 
Secondly, if the wound be great: the 
patient ought to keep his bed, if he cannot 
keep his bed: yet at the least he must keep 
his Chamber without taking any ayre 
which might anoy him. 
 
Thirdly, hee must keep an order in 
his lying, that is to say, he may not alwaies 
lye on one side: but ofte~ turn from 
one side to an other, aswel vpon the wunded 
part as otherwise, and espetially an 
houre before he be drest, to the end that 
the humours may discend to the greef, 
which ought to be vsed in wounds aswel 
with cuts as with pricas as shalbe said 
in his proper place. 
 
Fourthly, he must indure the Oil as 
[^f.2v^] 
hot as euer it can be possible, for it is the 
nature of the Oile tobe applyed seething 
hot, for the hotter he is applyed: the stronger 
he is in operation. It is needful also 
that he abstain from the company of women 
for because y=t= it would bring great 
inconueniences vnto him, and not for 
the time of his healing: but also xx. dayes 
after, and principally if the wound were 
great. 
 
[}A Preparatif.}] 
 
TO prepare the wound before the applying 
of the Oil, you shall take good 
white wine and boil it with one handful 
of Encence, (which is onely to comfort) 
with the which you shall wash the wou~d 
as hot as the Patient can suffer, bothe 
within and without, then wipe it very 
wel with a clene linen cloth before that 
you apply the Oyl, which shalbe shewed 
heerafter, the occasion and the time how 
to apply it: and when the afore said washing 
shall not be vsed. 
 
[}Of the Oyle.}] 
 
THe said Oil, the more older it is: the 
better it is and of the greater effect. 
And you shall remember (as before hath 
[^f.3r^] 
been said) to apply it as hot as may be, for 
by this meanes he shal the finelier perce 
and heale the wound the sooner. 
 
[}The time of dressing of the wound.}] 
 
IT is necessarye that if the wound 
come by any bitings or broosings: 
that he be dressed twise a day, and likewise 
to all other as shalbe said heerafter. 
 
That is to say, in winter at viij. of the 
clock in the morning, and at three of the 
clock at night. And in Summer at ix. of 
the clock in the morning, and at iiij. at 
night, because they be the moste co~uenient 
houres. But if they be green wou~ds: 
after the first dressing you shall not need 
to chaunge it again vntil the next day. 
 
[}The differences of diseases.}] 
 
THe wounds & diseases doo differ, for 
some are olde & some are new, some 
in one parte and some in an other, as 
in the hed, armes or legs, and other places, 
for the which the wounds doo differ, 
as shalbe shewed heerafter of euery one 
particulerly, and also the maner & vsage 
to applye the said Oile according to the 
maner and greef of the diseased parte. 
 
[^f.3v^] 
[}The vse of the Implaister that is tobe 
applyed with the Oyle vpon the 
diseased parte.}] 
 
FIrst for wounds of the hed, you shall 
shaue away the heares or iij fingers 
breadth round about the wound. 
And then stay the blood with lint or tow 
beeing dipt in the said Oyle, with the 
which you shall fil the wound, and vpon 
that apply a linnen cloth ij. or three double, 
which shall couer all the place, (as 
far as the here hath been shauen away) 
beeing steped in the prepared wine before 
mentioned, and afterwards wrung 
out then role it vp. This is it that ought 
tobe applyed at the first dressing. Also 
this is tobe vnderstanded, that at y=e= first 
dressing the prepared wine ought not to 
bee vsed for feare of causing the flux of 
blood. 
 
Also you shal note that if the wound 
be very great, or in a dangerous place, 
by the which meanes there might ensue 
a flux of blood: you shall dresse it but once 
a day at the first and second dressing, and 
from that time foreward, at euery dressing 
you shall wash the wound with the 
prepared Wine aforesaid bothe within 
and without, the~ wipe it very clene with 
[^f.4r^] 
a fine linnen cloth that the wound may 
be made clene within and without, for 
it is very needful. 
 
Then afterwarde you shall fill the 
wound with Oyle and couer it with lint 
steeped in the same, and vpon that again 
apply a linne~ cloth ij or iij. double round 
about beeing dipt in the said said Oyle. 
And then vpon that again lay an other 
cloth moistened in the said Wine and 
wrung as aforesaid. 
 
This is the particuler order of all maner 
of wounds and must be vsed til such 
time as you perceiue the wound is vpon 
healing, and then you shall heale it vp 
with this Unguent folowing. 
 
[}The manner to make the Vnguent 
and how it ought tobe vsed.}] 
 
TAke of the said Oile Magistrale, Venis 
Turpentine and new Wax, of 
eche like quantitie, set it on the fire in a 
little pan, alwaies stirring it the space of 
a quarter of an houre. Then take it from 
the fire and let it cool, and whe~ it is colde: 
put it in a box and keep it to your vse. 
And when you shall haue occasion to vse 
it: it wil serue bothe for the Unguent, 
and the Implaister. You shall apply the 
[^f.4v^] 
Unguent vpon Lint and lay it to the 
greef, and afterwards a little dry Lint 
vpon that, and then applye vpon that again 
an Implaister made with the forsaid 
Unguent, 
 
[}Heer foloweth the particuler orders 
how to apply this Oile Magistrale 
in euery disease}] 
 
FOr wounds of the head, you must 
haue a good consideration whether 
it were doon with stone, staffe or fall, or 
such other like accidents which are commonly 
called contusions. So that if the 
wou~d be healed vp, and that there be ingendered 
any Apostume or accidents 
(which may chaunce by contusion or brusing 
of y=e= vessels or breking of the bones) 
it would be a great offence to the brain. 
 
Wherfore to auoide such inconueniences, 
you shall order it in this sort, that 
is, you wall shaue the heare of the place 
round about it, and then wash it very 
wel with the said Wine, then wipe it 
very clene, and anoint it round about 
with the said Oile, and lay round about 
it linnen clothes steeped in the said Oile, 
and vpon that again other linne~ clothes 
steeped in the said wine, which shalbe 
[^f.5r^] 
vsed for the space of v. or vi. dayes or according 
to the greef of the place. 
 
[}For vvounds of the legges.}] 
 
IF the wound be in any of the legs, 
and the muscles or sinewye partes, 
beeing cut ouerthwart: it must be stiched 
according to the bignes of the wou~d, or if 
therebe any dislocatio~ of y=e= bone: you shal 
place him in his due order after the best 
maner. Then you shall wash the wound 
bothe within and without with the said 
wine, & if you fear any accidents whiche 
might happen by th'offence of the wou~d: 
you shal wash the whole member w=t= the 
said wine. As if it be in y=e= arme, from the 
shoulder to the fingers ends, & if it be in 
the thigh: down to the ends of the toes. 
Afterwards anoint the whole member 
with the said Oile & lay round about it 
a linne~ cloth steeped in y=e= said Oil, & vpon 
y=t= another double cloth beeing steeped 
in y=e= aforsaid wine & wrung. And the~ role 
it in such sort y=t= it be neither to straight 
nor to slack, & as for y=e= rest of y=e= cure: you 
shall finish it in such order as hath been 
shewed before in the wou~ds of y=e= hed, but 
if it chau~ce that the wound be very great 
and that there be loce bones which must 
be had out: you shall apply a tent in the 
[^f.5v^] 
lower parte of the wound, for feare lest 
the wound should shut vp to soon, and by 
that meanes might fall to some inconuenience. 
Therfore you shall keep in the 
tent til such time, as you haue taken 
out all such things as is against nature. 
 
[}Of wounds made with Hargubush 
and thrusts with Swoords, Pikes, 
and such other like.}] 
 
FIrst it is necessary to stay the flux of 
blood as before hath beene said in 
wounds of the hed, then wash the wou~d 
with the foresaid wine and wipe it very 
clene. And if it fortune that the wou~d 
perce through the member: you shall 
tent bothe sides of the wound, according 
to the length therof, to the end that you 
may purge the wound of Contusion or 
brused blood, which might remain in it 
& so to be drest twise a day. And you shall 
dresse bothe sides of the wound, as before 
hath been said, bothe in the washing and 
anointing. And if it be so that the wound 
perce through y=e= body: you shall tye y=e= tent 
with a threed lest it should slip into the 
body and so anoy the Patient. And also 
day by day as occasion shall serue to shorten 
the Tent. 
 
[^f.6r^] 
[}Of svvellings and Apostumations.}] 
 
IN what part of the body soeuer ther 
chaunce any Apostume or swelling 
whether that it wil come to matter or resolue: 
you shall bathe the greeued place 
with the aforesaid wine being warmed 
and lay theron linnen clothes (beeing steped 
in the said wine and wrong) a good 
breadth round about the place, as before 
hath been said. And if you see y=t= it resolue: 
apply the sayd Oile and wine vntil such 
time as it be whole. And if it come to 
suppuration: you shall vse it as before 
hath been taught. 
 
[}For the Hemerhoids.}] 
 
YOu shall wash them with the foresaid 
wine, and then apply your Oil 
with linnen clothes, as afore said and 
vpon that your prepared Wine. 
 
[}For colde Gouts.}] 
 
FIrst you shall anoint all the whole 
greeued place with the said Oil, then 
apply linnen clothes vpon that, beeing 
steped in scalding water, and wrung 
very hard. This doon three or foure 
times: shall cease the pain. 
 
[^f.6v^] 
[}For Cankers.}] 
 
IF the Canker be not opened: the 
washing with the said Wine, and 
the pledgets steeped in the said Oil and 
applyed wil cause him to ope~, and when 
he is opened, you shall prosecute the cure 
as afore hath been said. 
 
[}For pain in the Raines.}] 
 
YOu shall anoint the Raines very 
wel with the said Oil from the ridge 
of the back to the belly, then vpon that 
apply a linnen cloth beeing steped in seething 
water and wrung hard as before 
hath been said, & vpon that again great 
pledgets of Towe, and you shall wrap 
his legges very warme with hot clothes 
and let him lye down vpon his bed and 
couer him warme, then wil he begin to 
swete, which sweate wilbe an occasion 
of his helth. 
 
[}For olde Vlcers.}] 
 
YOu shall first cut the lips of the Ulcer 
with a very sharp Razur, then 
wash it very wel with the foresaid wine 
and so finish the rest of the cure as before 
hath been said. 
 
[}Finis.}] 
 
[^f.7r^] 
[}Galenes third Book of the 
composition of medicens.}] 
 
GAlen (the father 
and light of Phisick) seeing 
the great abuse whiche 
was in his time in 
the curing of wounds 
and hurts of Nerues or 
Sinewes: thought it necessary (in this 
his third Book of the composition of medicens) 
generally to intreate and write 
the method or maner of curing wounds 
in y=e= Nerues or Sinewye partes, which 
cure before Galenes time was much abused, 
and many patients suffered bothe 
terrible torments with losse of their limmes 
and also greeuous conuolsions and 
painful cramps, not without dau~gerous 
feuers and great putrifaction, hastening 
vntimely death. 
 
So that there was none that had the 
perfect cure therof, for at the beginning: 
they vsed conglutinatiue and knitting 
[/1./] 
medicins, which they ought not to haue 
doon. And if there chaunced any inflamation: 
then they fomented the afflicted 
place with hot water, and applyed Cataplasmus 
[^f.7v^] 
of whete meale, boyled with 
Hedrælæqin, that is to say Oil and water 
boyled togither, in the which was a 
great error and contrary to all true method, 
for in so dooing: the diseased parte 
quickly corrupted, and came to putrifaction, 
by reason of vnnatural heat and to 
[/2./] 
much moisture, which are the onely and 
cheefest causes of putrifaction. 
 
Neuerthelesse it dooth not followe 
that at all times drying & cooling things 
ought tobe vsed, because that the colde is 
an enemy to the Sinewes, as Hippocrates 
[/3./] 
testifieth, wherfore there must be 
vsed drying things tempered with moderate 
heat or at the least more declyning 
to heat then to colde, which ought tobe of 
a suttle and percing substance, for heate 
alone dooth not ingender putrifaction, except 
it be mixt with abu~dant moisture. 
 
And after these things beeing well 
considered: there must be diligent regarde 
[/4./] 
whether the Sinew be vncouered 
or not, for if the sinew be vncouered: the 
medicen ought not to be so strong, for in 
such a case, gentle and milde medicens 
are most meet where the Sinew is bare 
otherwise it wil bring moste perrillous 
accidents. 
 
[^f.8r^] 
These medicens that are heer rehersed 
are of a thin suttle substance or nature 
as Succus cerenæus, Succus medicus, 
[/5./] 
Sagapenum of the East, Euphorbium 
of the West, and the iuce of Tithimales. 
Of minerals or medicens which 
are found in the Earth, some be very suttle 
as Aphronitru~ id est Nitrispuma, 
the frothy parte of Nitrum, which easely 
wil dissolue or be melted in water. Likewise 
these are suttle, Nitrum beronicum 
and Asia Petra, the floure of which 
among all earthly medicens is the most 
suttle Of metalls Lorpin and Sulphur 
be both suttle and hot. After these Misy, 
verdigrece and Chalcitis a mineralls of 
Lime, the which be very hot and somewhat 
astringaunt. 
 
Therfore in the compounding of suche 
suttle medicament~: we commonly burn 
or at the least wash and such like to mitigate 
the fircenes of their corosiue & fretting 
nature as Chalcitis. And next to 
this are placed Spodium, Pompholix, 
Psoicum & Chrisocolla, medicens of suttle 
substance, without any smarting 
heate. And of the like qualities are Succus 
laurinus and Cedrinus, that is to 
say the iuce of Bayes and Cedre. Neuerthelesse 
[^f.8v^] 
the Bay is not so suttle as the Cedre. 
And of the like qualities and kindes 
is the licour or water of Lixiuii whiche 
the Greeks call Stacta, and yet Oile of 
Cedron is of a greater and more excellent 
vertue, although that the said Lixiuii 
be made of suttle things moste finely 
and artificially burnt. 
 
[}The composition of this said Lixiuii.}] 
 
Is of a wilde Figge tree, whiche the 
Greeks call Erineon, and of Tithimales 
burnt. The best of y=e= said Tithimales is y=t= 
which the Greeks call Characias, which 
is the male & the greatest moouer. The 
Corne which the Greeks call Sitera that 
is to say Whete, and Eruus or Orobus 
is the moste suttlelest, considering that 
they haue no great facultie to heate. 
 
You shall vnderstand that the moste 
parte of Simples whiche are suttle and 
fine are hot. And those which are of grocer 
substa~ce, colde, the reason is euide_[^ORIG. BLURRED^], 
for the heate is suttle and light, and the 
colde: thick and heauy, and dooth bothe 
represse and binde togithers. 
 
Yet for all that some colde Simples 
haue a sharp qualitie with suttle substance, 
yet in operation it is cooling, as 
[^f.9r^] 
Uinagre, for among all the Simples it 
[/6./] 
is moste suttlest. 
 
Therfore it is necessary to haue good 
knoweledge in the nature and qualitye 
[/7./] 
of simples, wherof medicens haue their 
beeing. For without the knowledge therof: 
it is not possible to doo any thing in 
this art, and especially in the cure of Sinewes 
worthy commendation. It suffiseth 
not to haue great store of Receipts, 
except ye knowe the particuler nature 
of euery simple. And with hauing knowledge: 
he shalbe able to frame his composition 
him self, according as the nature 
of the greef shall require. 
 
The parfit knoweledge of Simples 
is in three thinges, that is to say, of 
plants, of metalles, and of liuing things, 
and it is not sufficient to see them once 
[/8./] 
or twise: but you must marke and beholde 
them often, as in their beginning, 
growing, state, and declination. For by 
[/9./] 
this beholding: you shall knowe in what 
time it is best to gather them, if they be 
not gathered in their due time: the heat 
of the Sun will burne and take away 
their vertue. And also the place where 
they must be kept ought tobe temperate 
in heat & moisture, for feare of chau~ging 
[^f.9v^] 
their nature or vertue, for without the 
knowledge therof it is not possible for a 
Chirurgian to haue the true vnderstanding 
and method to compound medicens 
nor to gouerne well the curation of diseases. 
 
So then it is necessary to knowe the 
nature and facultye of Simples whiche 
is amply shewed in many good Bookes 
and especially by Galen in his Booke of 
Simples. 
 
I finde a certain history in the foresaid 
Author the which I think may wel 
[/10./] 
and fitly be rehersed in this place, to 
make this more plain to y=e= reader. Upon 
a certain time there was brought to Galen 
a childe, hauing a co~tusio~ or broose vp 
on the first ioynte of his middle finger in 
such sort y=t= the whole ioint began to putrifye 
& corrupt, the~ Galen applyed to the 
putrified parte a Cataplasme or Pultise, 
made with Barly mele & wax, & fome~ted 
it with the Lixiuii rou~d about the afflicted 
place, but where there was greefe 
and pain: he made fome~tation with hote 
Oyle, and then after the moisture was 
drawen out, by the applying of dry wul, 
he vsed a medicine made with Oil, wax 
and Euphorbium, by the which meanes 
[^f.10r^] 
he preserued the ioynt. The like he did 
to an other which came to him in winter 
[/11./] 
which had great colde with pain in 
his Knee continually, the which he cured 
in like maner with Oile and Euphorbium, 
for the Sinewes and tendones 
doo receiue all one curation, and the accidents 
that chaunceth to the one: chaunceth 
to th'other. For the names of such 
passions or greefs it is no matter, for because 
it is not the names that doo either 
good or harme. But it is the facultie of 
the medicins which doth all. Let vs return 
to the cure. 
 
Afterwards the said Childes finger 
began to putrifie more and more, and he 
began to feel pain and greef vpwarde in 
the whole places. Then Galen in the 
place of Barly mele: y=e= tenth day, did vse 
the mele of Orobus w=t= the said Lixiuii, 
or Stacta wherewith the Patient began 
[/12./] 
to amend, and within iij. dayes was 
eased of his pain, sauing that there remained 
in y=e= brused place, a certain Neruous 
or knotty substance muche like vnto a 
great tendone y=e= which was redy to fall, 
& after beeing half rotte~: fel all togithers, 
which did make many think, seeing this 
knotty substance: that the Sinew had 
[^f.10v^] 
been altogithers rotten, which was for 
lack of the knoweledge of their Anothomy, 
[/13./] 
and for lack of that knowledge they 
did not consider how the Tendones or 
Cordes are couered with the said Nerues, 
Membrana as defensatiues, not 
only throughout the inside of the ha~d: but 
fro~ thence go in order to all the fingers. 
 
Then after that Galene had taken 
away that which was putrified from the 
said broose: the corde was very sound and 
clene, & then he vsed Trosis dissolued in 
Sapa, & applyed it in y=e= foresaid Neruous 
parte, & made particuler vnction again 
and in like maner vsed the Pultis, and 
the anointing with Euphorbium as afore 
said. And when he had thus doon: the 
fourth day, did think with him self what 
medicin that were best then to applye, 
and considering that if there were no 
inflamatio~ or diste~perance: it were best 
to apply skinning things, but if there 
were any inflamation: then he thought 
best to vse moderate drying things without 
Cicatrising or skinning. 
 
And when he did see there was inflamation: 
he vsed the medicament that 
is called the green Plaister of Epigoni, 
which the Greeks call Isis. The whiche 
[^f.11r^] [^Original misnumbered as f.10.^] 
Emplaister you shall finde in his second 
book of composition of medicins in generall, 
then afterwards for to finish the 
cure: he vsed an other medicine composed 
as foloweth.

had thus vsed it: the~ he came to sicatrisatises 
and for the outwarde parte 
he applyed Euphorbium 
mingled with Wax 
& Rosin in forme 
of an Emplaister. 
 
[^f.11v^] [^Original misnumbered as f.10.^] 
[}Method for the curation of 
the wounds of Nerues or Sinewes 
and of what facultie the medicins 
which must be applyed 
ought tobe.}] 
 
GAlen in his method of wou~ds 
of Nerues, did vse Liquid medicins 
and sometime Emplaisters. And without the 
wound about the place, hee applyed very 
soft Wul with hot Oile. Sometimes 
also he vsed Oil with a little Uinagre. 
 
[/14./] 
But in such sort that the colde vertue 
of the Uinagre was without offence, neuerthelesse 
the suttlenes or persing vertue 
did remain, and two or three times 
a day did vnbinde the wou~d to see if the 
medicine did make any fretting in the 
Ulcer or sore. And if it caused any greef 
or pain: then he fomented it with Oil as 
hot as the patient could indure. 
 
For if it be but warme: it wil doo more 
[/15./] 
hurt then good, and much worse if it bee 
colde, for the colde dooth stop and hinder 
out breathing of the member. But the 
heate dooth resolue and make thinner. &c 
 
As for the vse of water: it must bee in 
[^f.12r^] 
such sort vsed that at no time in the curation 
it touch y=e= Ulcer. Therfore when it 
dooth chau~ce y=t= there remaineth any cluttered 
or congeled blood tobe taken away 
out of the wound: it must be doon w=t= Oil. 
 
And for an example: Galen reciteth 
[/16./] 
an history of one which beeing hurt, was 
foure dayes without the feeling of anye 
pain, and when he did see that ther was 
no inflamation: he we~t abrode about certain 
ernest busines which he had to doo, 
the wether beeing very colde and taried 
somwhat long: then he returned to his 
house with great greef and pain, euen to 
the very nape of his neck. Then Galen 
beeing called after that he did see the pain 
that the Patient was in: made fomentation 
with hot Oil all about the pained 
place, and applyed great quantitie of 
wul moistned in Oil, and the liquid medicins 
made with Euphorbium and Castorum, 
and by this meanes the paine 
was eased, and after that he had slept: all 
the accidents did cease. 
 
Therfore it is very profitable to applye 
the Wul very warme, and so continew 
it whether it be applyed with 
Oile, or Oile and Uinagre, which may 
wel be doon, if you apply also vpon it dry 
[^f.12v^] 
Wul. 
 
And if it be in the Winter: the patient 
must keep his house vntill the fift or 
sixth day of his greef. For if he be free fro~ 
inflammation vntill the seuenth day, 
and that he feel no maner of pain or greef 
then he is without daunger. 
 
Also you shall keep in memory that in 
this maner of cure, colde Oile & astringent 
is contrary. But there must be vsed 
the suttlest Oile that may be gotten, 
as very olde Oile, for lack of the 
medicine that is made of Euphorbium 
or Uinagre, or other such proper medicine: 
Galen dooth teach to take in their 
rowme, Propolis beeing very new, liquid 
and fat, and very olde Leuen, or 
els of the iuce of Tithimall, with newe 
Leuen, or Propolis liquified in Oile 
with Leuen, dissolued in very sharp Uinagre, 
and the Oile must be very olde. 
 
The Floures that are tobe vsed to 
[/17./] 
make Pultasis or Cataplasemus of: are 
Farina, Fabaru~, Orobi, id est erui Lolii. 
Ciceris vel Lupinorum, Amarorum 
polenta, made of Barly with Oximel, 
these Cataplasmus bee not onely good in 
boisterous people: but also to all others, 
whether there be any inflamation or no. 
 
[^f.13r^] 
For lack of these aforesaid medicins 
you may vse these Cataplasmus folowing, 
that is to say Propolis beeing new, 
Liquid and fat, and apply it vpon the 
wound, somtime with Leuen alone and 
somtimes with bothe, & somtimes with 
mele of Orobis and Leuen, but the Leuen 
must be very olde, and contrarywise 
the Propolis must be new. If it be olde: 
you must soften it with Oile by the fire, 
or in the Sun, or els you may vse the 
iuce of Tithimales mingled with Leuen 
or Oxelam, the Uinagre must be very 
sharp wherwith the Oxelam is made. 
 
These be medicens which may soon be 
[/18./] 
had in a redines for lack of others, whiche 
at necessitie Galen did vse in wou~ds 
of Nerues. By this you shall note then 
that the medicins whiche be applyed in 
wounds of Nerue, in what maner so euer 
it be: ought tobe actually hot, and for 
the punctures or prickings of Te~dones, 
the medicen which is made of Euphorbium 
and olde Oile, in the fourme of a 
Liquid cerat is very good and proper. 
 
And with the said medicin Galen did 
heale one which was hurt in a tendone, 
within the space of foure dayes. 
 
Then there was one y=t= (seeing the good 
[^f.13v^] 
successe that he had with the Euphorbium 
and Oile) thought to take an example 
by the said curation, and did vse new 
Euphorbium, wherof did folowe greate 
heat and pain with corrosion in the Ulcer, 
in so much that he was constrained 
to call Galene to remedy it, the whiche 
by fomentation of Oil and Uinagre did 
appease the pain and diminish the accidents, 
wherfore it dooth appeer (as before 
hath been said) that you must not neglect 
to haue the knoweledge of the faculties 
and kindes of approoued medicins, 
[/19./] 
and of them whiche wil soon loose their 
strength, from the others which doo keep 
and maintain long time. For Euphorbium 
[/20./] 
is one of these kindes y=t= wil loose 
his heat very soon, which is easy (by the 
coulour) tobe knowen. For if it be new: it 
is of an asshie couloure. But if it be olde: 
it is of a pale or yelowe colour, & for that 
cause it is very dry, & wil hardly be dissolued 
in new Oil, for in y=e= mingling it doth 
drink vp the Oile incontinent, wherefore 
[/21./] 
to dissolue it wel: it must not be mingled 
togither with Oile all at one time, 
but laboured in a morter by little and little 
for fear of running togithers. 
 
Euphorbium is one of the Simples 
[^f.14r^] 
which wil soon loose his heate, and dooth 
not keep long, which is knowen easely 
only by the colours without tasting of it. 
 
[/22./] 
Truely when it is olde, it is not of an 
Asshye coulour as it is when it is new, 
but it dooth decline toward a pale or yelowish 
colour, and if it be new: in the tasting 
of it, it will bee so hot that it wil 
burn the tung But if it be olde: you shall 
feel no great heate in it, neuerthelesse, 
Euphorbiu~ dooth keep his vertue longer 
then Tapsia, for Tapsia in i. yeer loseth 
his stre~gth very much & in ij. yeers loseth 
his stre~gth vtterly & is good for nothing. 
But Euphorbiu~ if he be good when he is 
new, y=t= is to say if he be hot & burning as 
safore said: he wil last three yeeres, somtimes 
foure yeeres & to the fifth, but the 
he dooth vi. loose all his force & strength. 
 
For whiche cause Galen did vse often 
times olde Oile without wax, for because 
that the Euphorbium was of fiue 
or six yeeres of age. So that the vse of the 
Euphorbium cannot be comprehended 
by waight, for when it is new: ye must 
put twise so much Oile, and three times 
so much Wax, and if it be olde, the more 
Oile shalbe put to it and the lesse Wax. 
 
Wherfore if you will make the forsaid 
[^f.14v^] 
medicament in fourme of a Liquid 
[/23./] 
cerat: you shall put foure times so muche 
Oile as Wax. But if you wil make it 
in fourme of a Plaister: you shall put 
therto as much Oile as Wax, and principally 
if the Wax be olde and dry. For 
if the Wax be new: you shall not need so 
much Oile, and lesse in Summer then 
in Winter. 
 
[}For to make Emplastrum Carotodes.}] 
 
That is to say a Cerat or Ciroene, 
you shall take of the best wax, liquid it in 
Oile, then ad to the vi. parte of Euphorbium, 
and temper it, as aforesaid, or els 
as foloweth. 
 
Rec. Euphorbium, drachmas. 1. wax, 
drach. 6. Oile, drach. 5. or 6. And for because 
that the Wax is not so cleauing 
and viscus as Rosin or Pitch is: ye shall 
ad to either of the Cerats, Pich or Rosin, 
or of bothe, and then ye shall not need so 
[/24./] 
much Oile as you should haue doon, if it 
had been made onely with Wax. And 
this is to be noted that you ought to haue 
a diligent regarde to the moisture or drynes 
of the Rosins, for you haue so~e more 
dryer then other some, and others again 
be more liquid. Of the dryest of these 
[^f.15r^] 
kindes is that whiche some call Fricta, 
and others Colophonia. After the same 
kinde dooth folow, that which is brought 
in erthen pots, which is vnclarified, and 
when it is clarified: it is like the fore named 
Fricta. 
 
There is an other kinde which is called 
Pityinon phisema, that is to say German 
Pich which is more dryer then the 
other two aforsaid, the which Galen did 
iudge not tobe vsed in this cure because 
of his vncleenes but did vse the (afore 
said) Fricta. 
 
Ther be diuers kindes of these (as 
before hath been said) of the which some 
[/25./] 
wil remain more liquid the~ other some, 
for the Turpentine wil remain moste 
liquid, the other dooth soon dry, as Strobolina 
and Abiotina, and of these two, 
the hottest is Strobolina, and next vnto 
them in heat: is Turpentine. 
 
As for the Rosin of Cipres I doo not reken, 
for Galene neuer durst nor would 
vse it in any Plaisters to be applyed to 
Narues, because it is astringant. The 
[/26./] 
best and principall of all these kindes 
of Rosins: is Turpentine not for his 
heat, for Strobolina and Abietina (as 
before hath been said) are hotter. 
 
[^f.15v^] 
The whiche Turpentine Galene 
did vse by experiments, the great vtillitie 
that was in it to mundify, to resolue, 
and to drawe, and is very comfortable to 
the Nerues: witnesses also therunto Dioscorides 
and Anabarzeus. 
 
And when you wil haue the Cerat very 
cleauing: you shall put to the more Rosin 
(as is afore said) and mix it according 
with the Oile and wax. 
 
[}The Emplaister which Galen did vse.}] 
 
YOu shall take of Turpentine, and 
put therto three times so much wax. 
Then ad to them the xij. parte of Euphorbium, 
if you knowe not whether 
the Euphorbiu~ be exactly hot or no: you 
must prooue when the medicine is made 
by this meanes, that is, ye shall strike a 
little of it vpon a linnen cloth, and apply 
it vpon the thigh or arme, and there let 
it remain for a certain time, and if you 
perceiue that it dooth somewhat warme: 
then is the midicine temperat, and if it 
[/27./] 
doo cause no maner of sensible heat, or els 
that he giue more feruent heat then he 
ought: it is certain y=t= the medicine is either 
to weke or to strong. The heat may 
be diminished by adding the more of Oyl 
[^f.16r^] 
and wax, and also it may be augmented 
by adding to of the Euphorbium, for the 
confection of these kindes of medicins, 
the Propolis is y=e= best and most conuenible 
[/28./] 
amo~g all other kindes of Rosins, but 
it ought tobe new & fat, because it will 
the better drawe to the outwarde parte, 
the thick vapours, and superfluous humours, 
but Rosins are to be mingled 
with Wax, onely to giue thicknes and 
forme to plaisters, and are not so conueniable 
in this curatton as Propolis is. 
 
Therfore you shall note that in tender 
& soft complexions: y=e= medicins ought 
not tobe so strong, as in strong & boisterous 
complections. For y=e= Cerat which is 
mingled with olde Oile is very conueniable 
in some, and likewise Fermentum, 
that is to say Leuen, is very good so 
it be olde, for the older it is the better, because 
it dooth bothe resolue and attract 
more then new, moreouer Sulphur Viuum 
is very good in these afore said compositio~s, 
and it may be vsed with Tetrapharmacu~. 
Also Aphronitrum may be 
vsed and Beronictum litrum, so that it 
be not grauely, which may also be mingled 
with Tetrapharmacum. 
 
Arsenicum wich is called in the Attique 
[^f.16v^] 
tung, Arenicum, beeing mingled 
[/29./] 
with Tetrapharmacu~ is profitable, and 
for lack of these you shall vse Sandaracha 
as of Lime quenched and vnquenched, 
[/30./] 
washed & vnwashed. But there must be 
lesse of the vnwashed then of that which 
is washed: for because that it is more 
sharper then that which is vnwashed. 
 
Now then to haue the perfit knoweledge 
to heale wounds of Nerues, it is 
[/31./] 
needful to knowe the end and intention 
of the cure, likewise the facultie of simple 
medicines the which in this cure ought 
to drawe and resolue without excessiue 
heat and without great sharpnes or byting. 
And likewise it is needful to know 
[/32./] 
and vnderstand perfectly the Anathomye. 
And the nature and complexion of 
the members of the body, and perfectly 
to vnderstand the difference between 
the Tendones membranes & ligament~ 
for when occasion shall serue to stich any 
wound: you must not touch the te~dones, 
for the Tendones and the muscles haue 
coniuncion togithers, therfore when the 
muscles be seperated: there must be very 
good heed taken in y=e= stitching of them, 
lest you cause pain, for if they doo indure 
any pain: it causeth conuulsion, and 
[^f.17r^] 
then afterwarde turneth to putrifaction, 
and so all the partes there abouts dooth 
suffer the like accidents, yet neuerthelesse 
the musculous flesh may wel be stitched 
as shalbe heerafter said. Therfore 
to haue perfit knoweledge of the Tendons, 
this is to be vnderstanded, that 
therbe two kindes: that is to say, the one 
round like vnto a corde, for which cause 
the ancient writers haue so called them: 
the others be flat like vnto membranes, 
wherof some passe along by the thighe 
neer vnto the knee. Also they are within 
the palmes of the hands and the soules 
of the feet. 
[/33./] 
 
Now we wil return to the matter, 
in wou~ds of Nerues you must not make 
fomentation with hot water, as the Phisitions 
before Galenes time did: nor yet 
vse Cataplasmus made w=t= wheat meal, 
and boyled with Hidrelæum, for Galen 
made onely fomentation with Oile, and 
the medicines aforsaid, by which menes 
he healed many. And beeing but of the 
age of xxviij. yeeres, at whiche time hee 
came from Alexandria into his owe contrey, 
did inuent and deuise the maner to 
cure the wounds of Nerues: and since 
[/34./] 
that time hath doon many goodly cures, 
[^f.17v^] 
by the method and midicines aforesaid. 
And now for an example marke this 
history which is recited. 
 
Upon a time (among others) there 
was a certain Captain at war, the whiche 
had a wound in his thigh, transuersales; 
the whiche wound was of a great 
deapth, that the one side was drawen vpwarde 
& the other downwarde towarde 
the knee, & for to heale the said wound: 
Galen did not dout to stich it in the musculous 
partes. Neuerthelesse he gaue 
good respect in touching of any Tendon, 
for he knew that the muscles might wel 
be stitched without daunger and not the 
tendones, albeit that some ancient Phisitions 
doo stich but onely the vpper lips 
of the skin, though the wound be neuer so 
deep for they did fear to stich y=e= muscles, 
and there were others whiche would 
stich the fleshey parts of the muscles, but 
they were of the vpper parte of the wou~d 
and not in the depth. 
 
Wherfore when there did chaunce any 
deep wound beeing transuersales: he 
did boldely stitch the musculous partes. 
As for the other wound~ made according 
to the length of the member: it is not 
needful to stitch them, for with good and 
[^f.18r^] 
conuenient rowling the musculous parts 
may wel be agglutinated. 
 
Therfore they which be ignorant in 
the Anothomy, doo fear to stich the membranes 
with the muscles, but Galen beeing 
learned in that matter, did stiche 
[/35./] 
them safely & without danger, although 
that the large Tendones are muche like 
the membranes, yet for all that, there is 
difference, for the Tendones be more 
hard and of a grocer substance, then the 
said membranes be. Except it be in the 
muscles of Abdomen, which the Prince 
Auicenna calleth Mirac, for in y=t= place 
they be very tender and suttle, as the 
membranes be in all points, except it be 
in the straight muscles. 
 
By this it appeereth that the iij. parte of 
Phisick which the greeks call Chirurgia 
that is to say, the which is exercised by 
handy operation. Pharmaceutice, that is 
to say by medicines as to y=e= Apothecary. 
Diaitetice, by regiment of the life, haue 
need one of the other: wherfore he whiche 
dooth take vpon him this profession: 
ought exactly to be exercised in these iij. 
 
[/36./] 
After that he first hath had the perfet 
knoweledge of the Theorick, that is to 
say speculatiue, in the whiche is taught 
[^f.18v^] 
the method to cure by reasons and Demonstrations, 
and if he be ignorant in any 
of these: he is not worthy to be called 
a good Chirurgion, and shall neuer be able 
to doo any thing, which shalbe to the 
profit or easement of his Patients. 
 
[}The composition of medicines 
for wounds of the Nerues made 
of metalles.}] 
 
AMongst the metalls you must 
auoid them which are astringant, 
and principally in the 
prickings of the Sinewes. 
 
[/37./] 
But the abstersiues, as Aeris squama, 
& others are profitable. And this must be 
noted y=t= all metalls are partly of a groce 
and terrene substa~ce, because that there 
dooth contain in them, much earthy nature, 
wherfore they doo require to be prepared, 
to the end that they may be more 
suttle. One way to prepare them is this. 
 
First the said metalls ought to be laboured 
[/38./] 
in a morter, onely with very 
strong Uinagre, which hath a pearcing 
facultie, and ought to be so laboured very 
long. 
 
Ther be some of the said metalls that 
[^f.19r^] 
wil not wel be beaten, although they be 
very long labored. Neuerthelesse they 
may easely be dissolued as Chalcitis, misy 
and such like, but others may be beaten 
and redused into poulder, as Aeris 
Squama and such others. And this you 
shall note, that Chalcitis & Erugo if they 
be burnt: they haue lesse sharpnes in the~, 
wherfore the greater quantitie may be 
occupyed when any medicine is made. 
 
The Pastils or Trocis of Andronis 
Poluidas and Pacion, be right excellent 
and conueniable in wounds of Sinews, 
so that they be dissolued in Sapa as they 
[/39./] 
ought. 
 
Sapa is made of Must, that is to say 
[/40./] 
sodden Wine, but the said Must ought 
to be made of sweet Raysons, and not of 
sower, which are Abstersiues and of the 
latter running of the Tub, the whiche 
wine must be boyled vnto the consumption 
of the half, and with the said Wine 
the Pastils may be dissolued, to be applyed 
vnto the Nerues which lye bare. But 
when you vse them, you shall take that 
kinde of Polidas, for they be moste temperate, 
and principally in those bodyes 
which are temperate & tender, in which 
bodyes all y=e= kindes of Pastils ought not 
[^f.19v^] 
tobe vsed, but medicins according, which 
we haue al redy spoken of, and wil speak 
heerafter, for all bodies be not of one temperature, 
for they differ in three things, 
that is to say, as for their temperature, 
secondly in the augmentation of their 
age, and last in their states and exersises, 
as they whiche woork much, or liue 
idlely. Wherfore it foloweth that no 
medicine can bee conuenient, in all bodyes. 
[/41./] 
And for this cause you must haue 
two sortes of medicines, the one strong: 
and the other weke, and then when necessitie 
[/42./] 
dooth require, the mixtures may 
be according to the temperature of the 
body. 
 
[}Medicins for strong and boisterous 
people.}] 
 
Rec. Aeris squama parte. 3. Misyos 
crudi partes. 2. Chalciteos cruda parte 
1. Ceræ parte. 12. At the beginning when 
Galene prepared this medicament: hee 
did put to it Arsenicon, and after that 
when he sawe that it was superfluous: 
he left it out.

Rec. Misyos vsti. Chalcities vstæ, Erugini

part, 3. Ceræ, part. 5. 
 
For to make these medicines, the 
quantitie of the Oile ought to exceed the 
quantitie of the Wax, as if there be viij. 
[/43./] 
vnces of Wax, you shall put xij. vnces 
of Oile (which is a pound) and the Oile 
must be like the Oile of Sauen, that is to 
say, of a suttle substance, and not astringant, 
and the olde Oile is best. Wherefore 
new Oil which the Greeks call Homotribes, 
is neither good nor conuenient. 
 
After that the metalles haue beene 
wel beaten long time with Uinagre: you 
shall ad to of Thus, but it must be white 
and good, then again you shall beat it 
with the metalls, before y=t= you ad to the 
Cerot, but the quantitie of y=e= Thus shalbe 
the half of the medicins, for to make 
the medicine in a meane temperature. 
And if you wil make it more weak: you 
[^f.20v^] 
shall ad to more then the half of Thus. 
 
And if you wil haue the medicin more 
sharper: you shall not put to the halfe of 
Thus in the forsaid medicine. It is expedient 
that ye mingle some Rosin w=t= the 
Wax and Oil, neuerthelesse you ought 
to consider, that if you doo put to it Strobolina, 
that y=e= medicin wilbe more stronger 
and sharper, and if you put to it of 
Terebenthine: the medicin wilbe more 
softer and meane in sharpnes, and if you 
wil haue it between bothe: you shall put 
[/44./] 
to it Abietine or Beniamin larix, which 
is one of the moistest Rosins, and is of 
substance like vnto liquid Pich, whiche 
some merchants and Factors sel for Terebenthine, 
to them that knowe it not, 
nor can discerne the one from the other. 
 
Yet not withstanding there is great 
difference which may be easely kowen 
by the taste and by the sharp smel which 
he hath more then Terebenthine, neuerthelesse 
their strength dooth not differ 
much. 
 
Wherfore if you wil make your medicine 
in forme of an Emplaster: you shall 
mingle with your Wax, the vi. parte 
of the said Rosin, which is for a pound of 
wax: ij. vnces of Rosin, and if it be liquid 
[^f.21r^] 
and fat, half an vnce shall suffise. And 
when you wil not make the medicin in 
forme of an implaister: you may leaue 
out the said Rosin, but you may ad to of 
Galbanum so~times asmuch as of Thus 
according as need dooth require. For 
when you put to asmuch Galbanum as 
Thus: the medicament is the gentiller, 
and when you will haue it more stronger: 
you shall put to it but half so muche 
Galbanum, and sometimes the lesser 
waight or quantitie, as if there be iiij. 
[/45./] 
dragmes of Thus, and iiij. drams of Galbanum: 
the medicine shalbe the more 
mitigatiue and gentle. But if you put to 
but ij. drams of Galbanum: the medicine 
wilbe somewhat stronger. Wherfore 
in sensible and tender bodyes or Cacochime 
it is expedient to haue the medicine 
to be prepared with the more quantitie 
of Galbanum. Then when you 
wil make your medicine tobe applyed 
to the Nerue beeing bare or discouered: 
you shall not put in so much Galbanum 
for fear of causing pain, for the Sinews 
beeing bare may not abide any strong 
medicine. 
 
Among the simples, Uinagre is sharp 
and very painful, and for that cause Oil 
[^f.21v^] 
is applyed with it, and also sometimes 
Galbanum, and for lack of Galbanum: 
you may take such greaces that are of 
fine & suttle substa~ce, as of wilde beasts, 
that is to say, of Lions, wilde Bores, 
Leopards or Beares. 
 
Likewise of flying foules, as of wilde 
[/46./] 
Ducks and such other like, in their sted 
you may take of Cocks, Hennes or Chikens, 
but this is tobe noted that the greaces 
of wilde flying fowles and whiche 
[/47./] 
doo liue abrode in the feelds, are better 
then of them whiche be nourished about 
the houses, for those whiche be nourished 
within or about any houses: are more 
heauy, and their fat is of a more grose 
substance and more moist, for because 
that they are shut vp, & haue no scope to 
flye or run as the others doo, for the exercise 
& stirring of their bodyes dooth lighten 
and make fine their grose humours. 
 
When you wil haue your medicin of 
the thicknes of a Cerot: the~ must be added 
to the third or fourth parte of Wax, 
or if the greace be very moist: you may 
put to the one half of Wax, and so after 
such sort as shalbe thought good, but if 
the greace be mene between bothe, that 
is to say neither to dry nor to moist: you 
[^f.22r^] 
shall ad to the third part of wax, the whiche 
Cerot shalbe proffitable for many 
purposes, and is called Diasteaton, that 
is to say made with Talow and greace. 
 
[}The Medicine which is called 
Dieuphorbium.}] 
 
WE haue spoken heertofore of 
the qualitie, nature and facultie 
of the Euphorbium, 
and after what sorte it wil 
keep, & how in time he looseth his stre~gth 
and how he must be knowen by his coulour 
and substa~ce. Now we wil intreat 
of the medicines whiche are compounded 
with the said Euphorbium, and is 
made as foloweth. 
 
Rec. Euphorbii, parte, 1. Ceræ partes 
3. Olei, partes, 4. 
 
To the composition of this medicine 
the wax ought to be triple, that is to say, 
iij times so much in respect as of the Euphorbium 
and the Oile the fourth part, 
[/48./] 
but the Euphorbium must be new and 
good The vse of this medicine is profitable 
in the punctures of Nerues, and especially 
when it is feared y=t= the wou~d wil 
close vp, therfore it is necessary to haue a 
[^f.22v^] 
respect to the stre~gh of y=e= medicin, for if it 
be to weke y=e= qua~tity of Euphorbiu~ may 
be augmented, somtimes there may be 
added to the half of Euphorbium, & somtimes 
asmuch as of wax or more. Namely 
if the Euphorbiu~ be olde, for it must 
be according to the strength of the patient. 
But if the medicine be to strong: 
you may weaken it by adding to of some 
Oil, or els to make an other more weaker 
according to the forme and maner aforesaid. 
And if you wil knowe whe~ the 
medicine is to strong: you shall marke 
these signes that folow, that is to wit, if 
the Patient feeleth great heat with Erosion, 
[/49./] 
or if the partes about it be hotter 
then they were before, or if the pricking 
pain bee more raised vp then it ought to 
be, or if the side of y=e= said prick haue any 
inflamation. 
 
Therfore for to chuse apt and conuenient 
medicins: it is needful to make the 
composition in the which there is put iij. 
times so much wax as new Euphorbium, 
the whiche is more stronger then 
the other. If there be v. times so muche 
Wax: the co~position shalbe more weke 
and gentle. And if there be iiij. times so 
much wax: the composition shalbe mene 
[^f.23r^] 
between bothe. And if you wil haue your 
[/50./] 
Unguents such as the Phisitions call Acopa, 
[/51./] 
that is to say taking away of werines 
or pain: you shall put to iiij. times 
so much Oile as Wax. But if you wil 
haue it in forme of a liquid Cerot: you 
shall put to double of Oile to the Wax 
and if the Wax be dry: you shall put to 
of Oile ij. partes and a half, whiche is to 
say, for one pound of Wax, ij. pound and 
a half of Oile. And if you wil make it 
plaister wise: there must be added asmuch 
Wax as Oil, namely if the weather 
be temperat. And if the wax be to 
olde and dry, and that the weather be 
colde: there must be somwhat more Oil 
then wax. But if the wax be new and 
moist, and the weather hot: there must 
be somwhat more Wax then Oile, that 
is to say, for one pound of wax: xiij. vnces 
of Oile, & in the composition of the medicine, 
for the better mingling of the Oile 
and Wax togither: you shall ad to some 
Rosin and principally of Terebenthine 
or in sted Colophonia, and if you doo ad 
asmuch of it as of Wax: the Pich dooth 
make the consistance of the Cerot, and 
note, that which is moste liquidest: is 
the best, euen in like sorte as of the Rosins. 
[^f.23v^] 
And if the Rosin be liquid, as is the 
new Terebenthine: it shall suffise to 
put in the third parte, in respect of the 
Wax. 
 
When Galen did compound any medicine, 
wherin is Rosin and wax, it is to 
be vnderstanded that hee ment not that 
which was dry and olde: but such kindes 
of Rosin and Wax that were of a mene 
substance, for els beeing mingled with 
the others wil soone dry and loose their 
strength, and that for two causes. The 
first by the intemperature of heat of the 
weather, and secondly by the reason of 
beeing to long kept. As for Propolis: it is 
no other thing but white Wax, and it 
is more conueniable in plaisters and Cerots 
then Rosin or Pitch. And more 
Galene dooth account Terebenthine among 
the Rosins, and is moste conuenient 
of all the Rosins in the for said plaisters 
and Cerots. 
 
[}Medicines made of Simples whiche 
wil dissolue.}] 
 
THese Simples which folowe are liquible, 
that is to say, which wil dissolue 
vpon the fire, and whereof Cerots 
and Plaisters be made, and may 
[^f.24r^] 
be boiled with moist things as with water, 
Wine and Uinagre. 
 
The simples, which are these that folowe, 
Propolis, Wax, Rosin, Ladanum 
and Seuum, that is to say, Talowe, and 
Galbanum, whiche must be prepared in 
a double vessel co~monly called Balneum 
Mariæ, whiche is asmuch to say, in putting 
of the foresaid simples within some 
vessel, and then to set it in a Cauldron of 
water vpon the fire. There are also simples 
y=t= wil aswel dissolue without fire as 
with fire, in moist things as Gutta Ammoniaci, 
y=e= licour of Sagapeni, Panacis, 
Cerapion and Oppoponax. 
 
Rec. Oppoponacis, Galbani, Terebenthine, 
Propolis, ana parte. 1 
 
You ought to take good heed that your 
Propolis be neither dry or olde, but for 
lack of the other: you may put in such as 
may be gotten, but it must be double in 
waight and the other Simples must be 
new and liquid. 
 
[}A nother of the same effect.}] 
 
Rec. Aseti sexta 1. Picis. 1. pound. Oppoponacis 
4. vnces, the Pitch must be 
boyled with the Uinagre. Et fiat. 
 
[^f.24v^] 
[/52./] 
These medicins afore named are good 
in punctures of Nerues, and for biting of 
mad Dogs, and principally for a wound 
made by any venemous beast, by the reson 
that they are percing, and doo keep the 
sides of the wound from shutting togither 
by the whiche meanes the venim 
which lyeth within: shall the more easely 
be drawen out. But for because that 
the said medicines are strong: you must 
vse them in strong & boisterous bodyes. 
 
And if the said diseases, doo chaunce in 
tender and delicate people, as wome~ and 
little Children: then they must be liquified 
with some kinde of Oil, or resolutiue 
Unguent, namely Amaricum and Oppobalsamum. 
 
Then afterwards with Irinum and 
Comagenum, and in sted of these Susinum 
and Ciprinum, or if these be not to 
be had: you shall take Oil. Or if it be in 
Alexandria, you shall take Oleum recinum 
and Rhaphaninum, for surely there 
is abundance of this aforesaid in Alexandria, 
& also through all Egipt. But there 
is not tobe found Oleum sinapinum but 
with great dificultie, the which Oile if it 
be put in the afore said medicament: there 
is no dout but that it will be much more 
[^f.25r^] 
stronger and better to keep open the punctures 
of the Nerues, and if you haue no 
Oppoponax to make the: said medicin 
withall: you may take Sagapenum dissolued 
in Uinagre, Rosin or Propolis, 
[/53./] 
or some greaces, beeing very olde so that 
they be sharp, and of a suttle substance, 
as of a Lyon, Leopard, Beare or Fox or 
els of wilde Ducks. 
 
Or els these greaces folowing beeing 
very olde, of a Bul or of a Gote. And this 
is to be noted, that the older the greaces 
be: the more sharper, and namely the 
greace of a Hog the whiche is more soft 
and moist then all the aforesaid. And of 
the like nature is Wine and Uinagre 
and Mary, but of all Maryes: the best is 
the mary of a Hart, or of a Calf. Of these 
aforesaid medicines Galene dooth counsail 
to haue in a redinesse, the whiche he 
did alwaies vse in punctures of Nerues, 
wherwith he had good successe. 
 
[}The vse of Pigeons dung.}] 
 
FOr because that Pigions dung is 
sharp: it must be vsed in the stead 
of Euphorbium, neuerthelesse it is of a 
more suttle substance the~ Euphorbium, 
wherfore it is more conuenie~t in strong 
[^f.25v^] 
and boisterous people, as rusticall bodyes 
dryed with labours, Galen sometimes 
did mingle metalls togithers beaten 
in Uinagre in the forme (as before 
hath been said) and by that meanes the 
medicine was made more sharp, euen 
as though he had put in Uerdegrece. 
 
[}Of Medicines called Diabotanum, 
that is to say, made of 
herbes.}] 
 
GAlen the interpreter of Phisick 
and lerned in all thing~: 
would omit nothing whiche 
did appertain to the curation 
of wou~ds of Nerues, for whiche 
cause he hath taught diuers maners 
of curations, to the end that if the one 
should faile: they should haue others at 
all times when need required, and also 
when vpon the suddaine a Chirurgian 
is called to visit any Patients, wheras 
the Simples requisit cannot be gotten, 
therfore Galen right wisely hath taught 
the way to compou~d medicins for wou~ds 
of Nerues with hearbes in stead of the 
mettalls aforesaid. 
 
First the said Galen did compound 
[^f.26r^] 
medicines for wounded Nerues of those 
herbes which were of a suttle substance, 
[/54./] 
that is to wit of Dictamus, Amaracus, 
and Malus terræ whiche is Aristolochiæ, 
moreouer he did make some in the 
which he did put in Marou amaricum, 
which is Margerum, Polium argemonæ, 
whiche is called Aigrimony, Chamapitis 
id est vina artetica centaurium 
Radicis omnium, Aristolochiarum, 
Draconculi, Ficus agrestis, Brionia, Althea, 
Iridis, Acori mei, Asari phoud est 
Valeriana, Gentiana and Panacis. All 
the which herbes and roots afore named 
Galen hath written and declared in his 
Books of Simples. And this you shall 
note, that because they haue a bitterish 
tast without abstersion or immoderate 
sharpnes: they are co~uenient in wound~ 
of Nerues, and how they ought tobe vsed 
marke this that foloweth. 
 
[/55./] 
First they must be dryed, then stamped 
and beaten very fine, then searced 
through a fine searce. For if it be of a 
groce substance: it is not conuenient in 
wounds of Nerues, which dooth require 
the moste suttle and finest that may be, 
(as before hath been said) then after that 
these hearbes and Rootes be finely poudred: 
[^f.26v^] 
they must be mingled with Wax 
and Oyle, in suche sort as we haue said 
of Euphorbium.
