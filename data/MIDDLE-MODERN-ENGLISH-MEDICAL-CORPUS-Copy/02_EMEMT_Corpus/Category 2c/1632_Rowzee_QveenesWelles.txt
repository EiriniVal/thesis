[}A 
TREATISE 
CONCERNING THE 
Nature and vertues of Tunbridge 
Water in KENT.}] 
 
[}CHAPTER I. 
Of Water in generall.}] 
 
ALbeit my maine scope 
in this following discourse, 
be concerning 
Tunbridg water, yet 
will it not be altogether 
fruitlesse, or vnpleasant, I hope, 
to the Reader, if I say something, 
as it were by way of Preface, touching 
water in generall. Water is a 
substance absolutely necessary, 
that no living creature can subsist 
without the benefit of it, nor no 
[^p.2^] 
tree bring forth its leaues and fruit, 
nor any plant its seede, if they be deprived 
of that vivificall moisture, 
which maketh them all to grow and 
prosper. That this is true, you may 
obserue it in Summer, for if Raine 
be wanting but a few weekes, how 
hinderly be all things? How doe 
all plants wither in that seaso~, when 
they should chiefly flourish? For 
this cause perhaps it was, that Hesiodus 
thought water to be the most 
ancient of all the elements. Of this 
opinion also was Thales Milesius 
one of the seaven wise Grecians, 
who made water the sole principle 
of all things, Empedocles likewise 
junping with them, sayd that all 
things were made of water; and 
Hippon in [/1./] Aristotle termes the soule 
water. Hippocrates goeth not so farre, 
but yet he calleth water and fire the 
two principles of life. True it is, that 
by water Hippon doth vnderstand 
our seede, and Hippocrates our radicall 
[^p.3^] 
moisture. The Latins vpon 
The Etymologie of the word Aqua, 
water, doe derive it from a~ et qua, 
quasi a~ qua vivimus, vel a~ qua omnia 
fiunt, by which we liue, or out of 
which all things are made. Others 
will haue it quasi æqua, because there 
is nothing more equall and smooth 
then water, when it is not tossed 
with the winde. But [/2./] Iulius Cæsar 
Scaliger disliketh these Etymologies, 
and will deriue aqua from the 
obsolete Greeke word [^GREEK OMITTED^], which 
anciently did signifie water. This Element 
seemeth to challenge a kinde 
of rule and dominion over the rest, 
for it easily transmuteth ayre into it 
selfe, extinguisheth fire, and devoureth 
earth. And to goe no higher, 
then our grand-fathers memory, nor 
farther then our neighbours, the 
Ocean Sea swallowed vp aboue one 
hundred thousand Acres of ground 
at one clap in Holland. Nay it aspireth 
even vnto the heavens, and 
[^p.4^] 
which is strange, it doth not onely 
get vp thither in it selfe alone, but 
carrieth with it whole sholes of fishes, 
heapes of stones, and divers other 
heavy substances, which afterwards 
fall down with it. Most creatures 
liue without fire, without water 
none; & with water onely, without 
any other sustenance, a [/3./] Spanish 
mayden is reported to haue lived a 
long time; and Albertus writeth of 
a Melancholy man, who by the 
space of seven weekes lived with 
water onely, one draught of which 
he tooke but every other day. The 
[/4./] Lord Verulam also hath produced 
his opinion of late, and holdeth that 
Trees and Plants liue and are nourished 
meerely by water, and that the 
earth is as it were, but a Stabilimentum 
vnto them, to keepe them steadie, 
and from being beaten downe 
by the winde. Hee proveth it by 
Rose bushes, which being put into 
water, without any earth, & kept vpright 
[^p.5^] 
in the same, not onely brought 
forth leaues, but faire Roses also, 
And the [/5./] royall Prophet sayth, that 
a tree planted by the rivers of water, 
bringeth forth his fruit in due season. 
Much more might be sayd concerning 
water, but because I intend to 
be briefe, let this suffice. 
 
[}CHAPTER II. 
Of the differences of water.}] 
 
IN the Creation God sayd, [/6./] let 
there be a firmament in the middest 
of the waters, and let it divide the 
waters from the waters. And GOD 
made the firmament, and divided the 
waters, which were vnder the firmament, 
from the waters, which were aboue 
the firmame~t. [/7./] And David saith, 
that the Lord sitteth vpon the flood, 
that is vpon the Orbe of the waters; 
and where he exciteth the creatures 
[^p.6^] 
to laude the Lord, he speaketh thus, 
[/8./] Praise him ye heavens of heavens, and 
the waters that be aboue the heavens. 
Those waters are likened in another 
place to a [/9./] terrible chrystall, and sayd 
to be, as it were, [/10./] a paved worke of 
Saphir stone. [/11./] And some go so farre, 
as to define the place and seate of 
those waters, and say, that they are 
as much aboue the primum mobile, 
as the primum mobile is aboue the 
elementary waters, but whether 
they ever were there to take the iust 
distance, I doe not know. That there 
should be water aboue the firmament, 
many men thinke it strange, 
and yet the deluge, besides the expresse 
word of God, proved it to be 
true. For if all the water of all the 
Seas, Lakes, Ponds, Rivers, & Fountaines 
in the world, had been drawn 
vp into the heavens, in like manner, 
as we doe in distillations, yet would 
not their quantitie haue increased, 
but there would haue returned back 
[^p. 7^] 
againe, by raine, no more, then was 
ascended vp, nor so much neither 
perhaps, because though you be never 
so carefull in your distillations, 
and vse Glasse vessels neuer so well 
luted, yet will you still receiue some 
losse; and so the flood had not gone 
fifteene cubits aboue the highest 
mountaines. But why this should 
be stranger, then all the rest of the 
wonderfull works of God, there is 
no reason. The massie and heavy 
Globe of the earth and water standeth, 
as it were, an æquilibrio in the 
center of the world, suspended by 
the omnipotencie of God. Nay all 
his workes are vniversally so admirable, 
that there is no lesse wonder 
in the smalest Gnat, then in the biggest 
Elephant, in the least weede, 
that creepeth vpon the ground, then 
in the tallest Cedar. But of those 
waters, which are aboue the firmament, 
and of those, which were gathered 
together vnder the firmament, 
[^p.8^] 
namely the Seas, wee speake 
here but by the way, though concerning 
the Seas divers curious and 
pleasant questions might bee handled, 
as touching the saltnesse of it, 
the ebbing and flowing of the same, 
why it can endure no impure things, 
and the like. These things I say, 
might bring some delight to the 
Reader, but they are beyond our 
scope, and therefore I will onely 
speake briefly of thosewaters, which 
are potable, and in common vse amongst 
vs, either for dyet or Physicke. 
 
They are commonly divided into 
Fountaine-water, River-water, 
Well-water, raine-water 
and pond-water. The preheminence thereof is 
commonly given to Spring-water, 
but in generall that water is accounted 
best and wholesomest for dyet, 
which is pure, and without any tast, 
but such as water should haue. For 
most water retaineth some savour of 
[^p.9^] 
the ground through which it runneth, 
and albeit to those, who doe 
not vse to drinke water, it be imperceptible, 
yet divers of those, who 
drink nothing but water, will as easily 
perceiue a difference betwixt water 
and water, as wee doe betwixt 
beere and beere, or wine and wine. 
The best water also is lightest, but 
that lightnesse is not to be considered 
by waight (for snow-water is 
most light, and yet vnwholesome) 
but by the thinnesse of the parts 
thereof, and by the speedy heating 
and cooling of the same, as Hippocrates 
well observeth. Let this suffice 
to haue beene briefly touched 
concerning the differences of waters 
in generall, and let vs now say something 
with like brevitie concerning 
the originall of Springs and Rivers. 
 
[^p.10^] 
[}CHAPTER III. 
Of the originall of Springs and 
Rivers.}] 
 
IT is a common received opinion, 
derived from Aristotle, that the 
generation of water proceedeth 
from ayre condensated into the 
same, in the bowels of the earth, and 
distilling, as water doth with vs 
from a Limbicke. But it is hard to 
imagine how the nature of ayre 
should bee so speedily corrupted, 
and turned into water, and in that 
quantitie too, that should maintaine 
the continuall course of so many 
Springs, and so great a number of 
Rivers as are in the world, divers of 
which are of such vastnesse, and of 
So swift a course, that a man might 
justlythinke, that the whole element 
of ayre, which in its owne narure is 
[^p.11^] 
but very thinne, should scarcely suffice 
to maintaine the course of that 
aboundance of water one only day. 
And as for the reason they alledge, 
that ayre is retained within the concavities 
and porosities of the earth, ad 
vitandum vacuum, which nature 
doth abhorre, and afterwards is 
converted into water, it is but a very 
weake one; For those concavities are 
still full of ayre, as well else-where, 
as where Springs and Rivers doe 
flow. But if the transmutation of 
ayre into water, were the only cause 
of the flowing of all Springs and Rivers, 
surely their streams must needs 
be but narrow, & their course slow, 
and of small continuance. Besides, if 
this were true, how could the Sea, 
thinke you, containe that excessiue 
aboundance of water, which perpetually 
runneth into the same? The 
ancient opinion then is the truer, 
that all fountaines and rivers come 
from the Sea, and are transcolated 
[^p.12^] 
throught the veines and porosities of 
the earth, where in their passage they 
leaue their saltnesse. Plato Aristotles 
Master was of this opinion, and before 
him Thales Milesius; as also 
[/12./] Philo, [/13./] Seneca, and [/14./] Georgius 
Agricola, which without question 
they had learned from the Hebrewes. 
For thus speaketh the Preacher, 
[/15./] All the Rivers runne into the 
Sea, yet the Sea is not full, vnto the place 
from whence the Rivers come, thither 
they returne againe. This is a most 
cleare and expresse text, and which 
alone shall suffice to proue this 
point, especially seeing the rule and 
law of Nature doth suffragate vnto 
the same; For wheresoever there is 
a repletion, there must needs an evacuation 
bee. But some perhaps 
may say, wee see indeed all Rivers 
runne into the Sea, but we doe not 
see how they come from it. True, 
but when wee see that for all the abundance 
of water, which runneth 
[^p.13^] 
continually into the Seas, the same 
are not increased thereby, but remaine 
still the same, we must needs 
imagine that they disburthen themselues 
some where. For otherwise, 
the waters had long agoe overwhelmed 
the world, and reached vp 
even vnto heaven, seeing that the 
[/16./] Flood, caused but by raine of forty 
dayes, ascended fifteene cubits aboue 
the highest mountaines. Besides 
our very senses may perswade 
vs, that the originall of Springs and 
Rivers is from the Sea; for divers 
Springs of fresh water are in sundry 
places, which seeme to sympathize 
with the Sea, and to imitate the motion 
thereof by a kind of ebullition. 
And which is strange, and yet a 
thing avouched by divers good Authors, 
those things which were cast 
into the River of Alpheus in Grecia, 
were afterwards found in the 
fountaine called Arethusa, neere Syracu 
(a in Sicilie, though there bee a 
[^p.14^] 
great distance of Sea and land betwixt 
them, which gaue occasion to 
the ancient Poets (who did vse to 
involue all the secrets of nature in 
their fables) to faine that Alpheus 
and Arethusa were a couple of Iovers, 
which were transformed, the 
one into a River, and the other into 
a fountaine, and of them speaketh 
[/17./] Ovid, saying 
 
In latices mutor, sed enim cognoscit 
amatas, 
Amnis aquas, positoq; viri, quod 
sumpserat, ore, 
Vertitur in proprias, quo se mihi 
misceat, vndas. 
 
But whereas I said before, that 
for all the water, which runneth into 
the Seas, they remaine still the 
same, I would not be mistaken, for 
I know that the Seas haue somtimes 
gone beyond their ordinary bounds 
and limits, but it hath beene when 
[^p.15^] 
they were, as it were commanded so 
to doe by their Creator for the punishment 
of mens wickednesse, or 
whensoever men haue gone about 
to alter the naturall seate and state 
of the same, and the ordinary course 
of Rivers. 
 
Of Gods judgements there are diverse 
examples, as [/18./] Olenus & Helice, 
two of the 12. Cities which made 
the Common-wealth of the Achæans, 
which a little before the battell 
of Leuctra were drowned by the sea. 
Antissa, Tindaris, Burrba had the 
like fortune also, being swallowed 
vp by the Sea, together with all their 
Inhabitants. And that it might the 
[^p.16^] 
better appeare that the finger of 
God was in it, all such, as thought 
to haue escaped by shipping, perished 
as well as the rest, being drowned 
& overwhelmed by the waues. 
And of those who haue endevoured 
to contract and pin vp the Sea into 
narrower limits, by wrlls, dikes, and 
other workes, diverse of them haue 
often sustained great dammage by 
the same; as for example, the Hollanders, 
who, as we said before, lost 
aboue 100000. acres of ground by 
such meanes, which the Sea, after 
the overthrow of all their dikes and 
[^p.17^] 
strong workes, tooke away from 
them, as it were by Letters of reprisalls. 
This were enough to teach 
men that it is but in vaine to goe against 
the order established by God, 
and the ordinary course of Nature; 
yet it is worth the noting also, and 
a thing not to be considered without 
admiration, that all those Princes, 
who purposed to cut the Isthmus of 
Peloponesus, which is a necke of land 
betwixt two Seas, containing according 
to Mercator in his Atlas Major, 
some fiue miles in breadth, dyed 
all before the worke was begun, as 
Caligula, C. Cæsar, Demetrius, Nero, 
and Domitianus. 
 
[}CHAPTER IIII. 
Of waters of strange nature 
And effects.}] 
 
ALL Springs of Waters are 
actually, either hot or cold. 
Of those hot Springs some 
[^p.18^] 
are of so excessiue heate, that a man 
would thinke it were water boyling 
vpon the fire; and amongst other 
there is a veine of it running vnder a 
streete in a village called Porcet neere 
the City of Akin in Germanie. In the 
middle of this streete there is a hole, 
which they call Hell, with three or 
foure barres of yro~ over it, in which 
the neighbours round about, in the 
Sommer time, when they haue no 
fire, doe vse to seeth their egges, 
letting them downe with a Net into 
the water, and in a small space of 
time they may be boyled hard; of 
which I was twice an eye-witnesse, 
being there first in the yeare 1610. 
after the siege of Galick, and the yeelding 
of the Towne to the States, 
with that braue Souldier, Sir Horace 
Vere, now Lord of Tilbury, & the second 
time with that worthy Knight, 
Sir Henry Palmer, now Controller 
of the Navie. The cause of those hot 
Waters is commonly ascribed to 
[^p.19^] 
Mines of Sulphur or brimstone inflamed 
within the bowells of the 
earth. But few of those hot waters, 
as at Akin, Porcet, in the Pyrenean 
Mountaines, at Bathe in Sommersetshire, 
and elsewhere, haue any great 
or extraordinary taste of brimstone, 
as they should of necessitie haue, if 
brimstone melted and burning were 
the cause of their heate, that minerall 
being of so piercing a nature, and of 
so extensiue a facultie, that never so 
little of it burning vpo~ a few coales, 
when our women dry their tiffanies, 
filleth a whole room with the strong 
sent of it. Besides, such a great quantitie 
of water running continually, 
and so many yeares and ages together, 
had long since extinguished 
those fires; or if there were such 
flames within the bowells of the 
earth, the same would long agoe 
dryed vp the water, and reduced the 
earth into ashes. Another reason 
there is, that you shall finde no hot 
[^p.20^] 
Springs where fires doe breake out, 
and albeit the hill Vesuvius & Mount 
Ætna burne continually, yet are 
there no hot Springs about them, 
though they be environed by the 
Sea. And for all the late wonderfull 
and extraordinary eruption of fire 
out of the said hill Vesuvius, or Monte 
de Soma, as they call it now; which 
hath beene so violent, that the houses 
of Naples, which are eight or as 
others say twelue miles from the 
same, were all covered very thicke 
with the ashes thereof, yet doe they 
not write that the water which gushed 
out at the foote of the said hill 
was hot. 
 
Besides, albeit there be many hot 
waters in Italie (for those that haue 
written of them, reckon few lesse 
than threescore) yet shall you see no 
where a mixture of the fire and water in 
those parts. Which makes me thinke 
with some, that the cause of the 
heate of those waters proceedeth 
[^p.21^] 
from their motion and agitation in 
the bowels of the earth, falling from 
Cataracts and broken Concavities in 
the same. 
 
That this may be true, it may 
Be proved by the Sea, for though 
it be actually cold, yet if it be tossed 
by a Tempest but of three or 
foure dayes (and it is seldome that 
a storme lasteth longer) the water 
thereof will sometimes become 
very hot. Besides, we haue many 
very Sulphurous Springs, which are 
never but cold; as for example, one 
of the foure Springs vsed at the Spa 
called Geronster, which tasteth so 
strong of the brimstone (as my selfe 
can speake by experience) that diverse 
of those, who drinke of it, are 
constrained to hold their noses whilest 
they are a drinking, and the Sulphurous 
fumes of it are so piercing, 
that they doe speedily intoxicate 
the braine, and cause drunkennesse, 
though it be but for a little time, 
[^p.22^] 
being soone discussed away. [/19./] 
 
Now for the other Springs, which 
are actually cold, there are sundry 
differences of them, according to 
the severall substances they doe run 
through, and the nature and effects 
of some of them are very admirable. 
Some doe turne into stone whatsoever 
is cast into them, especially if the 
things cast in be of a loose and porous 
substance, as leather, balls, gloues, 
and such like; and Plinie and others 
describe diverse Springs of that nature. 
 
But not to goe out of this Island 
for examples, there is a Spring of 
that nature in Wales in a peece of 
ground belonging to Sir Thomas 
Middleton. And the quicke activitie 
of some of those Springs is wonderfull, 
[^p.23^] 
and almost incredible; for 
Bodinus doth [/20./] affirme, that he hath 
seene stickes of wood, strawes, and 
such like small things convertes into 
stone in Lacu Piceno et Alliensi fonte 
Avernorum, within the space of 
two or three houres. So that Plinies 
assertion, who [/21./] saith, that earth is 
turned into stone in a fountaine of 
Gnidus within the space of eight 
moneths, is no more to be wondred 
at. The same Author, namely, Plinie, [/22./] 
maketh mention of two fountaines, 
the one called Cerone, which 
maketh the sheepe, that drinke of it, 
to beare blacke wooll, and the other 
Melan, which maketh the wooll of 
the sheepe, which drinke of it white, 
and if they drinke of both, their 
wooll will become of two colours; 
And of another called Crathis, which 
procureth whitnesse, and of a fourth 
called Sibaris, which causeth blacknesse 
in the sheepe and Oxen, which 
drinke of the same. Nay, the same 
[^p.24^] 
effect is seene also in men, which 
drinke of them, for those that drinke 
of Sibaris, become blacker, harder, 
and of a curled haire, and such as 
drinke of Crathis waxe whiter, softer, 
and of a smooth haire. He bringeth 
in also other Waters, which 
haue the like effect in changing the 
colour of such as vse them. He saith 
likewise, that there are two Springs 
in Bæotia, neere the river of Orchomenus, 
whereof the one strengtheneth 
memorie, and the other causes oblivion. 
A fountaine in Arcadia called 
Linus preserveth conception and 
hindreth aborsement, and on the other 
side, the river called Amphrisus 
maketh women barren. Cydnus, a river 
of Cilicia helpeth the Gowt in 
the feete, as appeareth by the Epistle 
of Cassius Parmensis to Marcus Anthonius; 
and contrariwise by the vse of 
the Water, which is in Træzene, all 
men get the Gowt in their feete. 
All such as drinke of a lake called 
[^p.25^] 
Clitorius, beginne thereby to hate 
wine. Polyclytus relateth, that the 
water of a fountaine in Cilicia serveth 
in steade of Oyle; And Theophrastus, 
that the like is done by the 
water of a Spring in Æthiopia; and 
Lycus, that the water of a fountaine 
in India burneth in a Lampe. The 
like is also at Ecbatana. Iuba speaketh 
of a Lake amongst the Troglodytes, 
which for the hurt it doth, is called 
the mad-like, and saith that it is bitter 
and salt thrice in a day, and then 
fresh, and so againe at night. The 
same Author also maketh mention 
of a Spring in Arabia, which bubbleth 
vp with such force, that it casteth 
forth whatsoever is throwne 
into it, though it be never so waightie. 
There are two fountaines in 
Phrigia, the one called Clæon, and the 
other Gelon, having those Greeke 
names from their effects, for the first 
maketh men cry, and the second 
makes them laugh. There is an hot 
[^p.26^] 
Spring at Cranon, and yet without 
excessiue heat, which being mingled 
with Wine, and kept in a vessell, 
keepeth the same hot by the space of 
three dayes. There is a river in Bithynia 
called Olachas, into which if 
perjured persons be throwne, they 
feele as much heate, as if they were 
in a flaming fire. In Cantabria there 
are three Springs but eight foote asunder, 
which running together 
make a goodly river, and every one 
of them by turnes becommeth dry 
twelue times, and sometimes twentie 
times a day, so that a man would 
thinke there were no more water in 
it, whilest in the meane time his next 
neighbours be full, and flow continually. 
There is a brooke in Iudea, 
which is dryed vp every Sabbath. 
In Macedonia, not farre from the sepulcher 
of Euripides, there are two 
brookes running together, the one 
having very wholesome water, and 
the other poisonous and deadly. 
[^p.27^] 
Quod si quis, saith [/23./] Plinie, fide carere 
ex his aliqua arbitratur, discat in nulla 
parte nature majora esse miracula. If 
any man thinke, that some of these 
things are part beliefe, let him learne 
that there are no greater miracles in 
any other part of nature, than in Waters. 
But if any man desire to know 
more concerning the various nature 
and effects of Springs and Rivers, 
let him reade the thirteenth dialogue 
of Simon Majolus, Bishop of Vultuaria, 
in that Tome of his Workes, 
which he intitleth Dies Caniculares, 
and there he will finde wherewith 
to satisfie his curiositie. I passe now 
to mineral and medicinable springs, 
which vse to be drunke. 
 
[}CHAPTER V. 
Of Minerall and Medicinable Springs.}] 
 
MInerall waters, by their manifold 
turnings and windings 
vnder the ground, are 
[^p.28^] 
as it were impregnated with diverse 
vertues and faculties of the severall 
mineralls, through which they run, 
and draw with them, either the faculties, 
or substance of the same, and 
sometimes both. And therefore as 
meere purenesse commandeth ordinary 
Springs and Wells, so doth the 
various mixture of severall things, 
though somtimes of a contrary and 
repugnant nature, procure commendation 
to medicinable waters. Some 
of them are beholding for whatsoever 
they haue to the severall kinds 
of earth, which they passe through, 
and licke, as it were, by the way, as 
Bole, Ocre, Rubricke, Chalke, and the 
like; Others to liquors or congealed 
juyces, as, Allum, Bitumen, Brimstone, 
Nitrum, Coperose; And others 
againe to Mettalls, as gold, silver, Iron, 
Copper, Tinne, Lead. There 
are some also, which owe their vertues 
to stone, as Crystall, Marble, 
Pumice stone, Lapis Hæmatites,and 
[^p.29^] 
the like; and others to the roots of 
trees & plants, though these be rare, 
either because trees doe not roote so 
deepe, or by reason that medicinable 
springs are commonly in barren 
soyles, as on the contrary wheresoever 
there is a fruitfull soyle, there 
are no minerall or medicinable 
springs to be found. Out of all 
these subterraneall substances diverse 
springs draw sometimes contrary 
faculties, or at least such as 
haue but small affinitie one with another, 
and from hence it happeneth 
that oftentimes one & the same medicinable 
spring cureth diverse diseases, 
which are either contrary one 
to another, or at least haue but small 
affinitie together. It is of this as it is 
of Theriake or Mithridate, which 
are compotions co~sisting of a great 
number of simples of contrary and 
repugnant natures, as it were hudled 
together by chance; and yet when 
those compositions haue had their 
[^p.30^] 
due fermentation, and that those severall 
simples haue wrought one 
vpon another, and become to be incorporated 
together, there resulteth 
afterwards an vniversal forme in the 
composition, which maketh it excellent 
for most diseases, and as it were 
a generall Panpharmacon. And in 
that regard some doe merrily call 
Mithridate the father, and Treacle 
the mother of all medicines. But 
that we may the more accurately distinguish 
betwixt minerall Springs, 
we must consider the nature of the 
mineralls, and looke which of them 
haue affinitie together, & which not. 
Bitumen, Salt, Sulphur, Coperose, Copper, 
are hot, and therefore they haue 
a facultie to cut, cleanse, open, dry, 
extenuate, and disperse. [/24./] Albertus 
Magnus, and after him Andernacus 
and others, doe reckon Sal nitrum 
with these, and hold it to be hot, 
which might be granted them, if by 
nitrum they vndersood that nitrum, 
[^p.31^] 
whereof [/25./] Hippocrates, [/26./] Dioscorides, 
[/27./] Plinie, [/28./] Galen doe speake; But I doe 
not thinke that either Albertus or Andernacus 
ever saw it, because it began 
to be scantie & hard to be found 
in the time of those ancient Authors 
before cited after Hippocrates. But 
our Saltpeter, which is now called 
Nitrum amongst vs, is as farre from 
that ancient Nitrum, 
 
Quantum Hipanis veneto Dissitus 
Eridano. 
 
For if gunpowder were not enough 
to proue the coldnesse of Nitrum, in 
which its opposition and contrarietie 
to Brimstone is so manifest, yet 
were the Sal prunellæ of the Chymists 
(which is nothing but Nitrum purified 
from its dregs with Flores sulphuris) 
sufficient to evince it, a very 
little of it put into a glasse of Wine, 
making it so cold, that one is scarce 
able to drinke it. And to this purpose 
[^p.32^] 
I remember that when I was in 
Holland, the Prince of Orenge, Maurice, 
was wont alwayes in the Summer 
time to haue some of it throwne 
into the water, where his Wine lay 
a cooling. That Sal prunellæ also is 
the best remedie against the heate, 
drinesse, & roughnesse of the tongue 
in all feavers, and especially in that 
Hungarian-feaver called Prunella, 
from that symptome, which gaue 
likewise the name of Sal prunellæ to 
that purified Nitrum, by reason of 
the excellency of it in asswaging the 
same. And the more to confirme 
this, one of the foure springs of the 
Spa called Tounelet, and consisting 
chiefly of Nitrum, is so very cold, 
both in the mouth, and in the stomacke, 
that few can endure it, and 
in that regard it is very little frequented; 
and during my stay there 
I doe not remember that I ever saw 
at it more then a Capuchin friar, and 
another Clergie man, who vsed it 
[^p.33^] 
for the heate of their livers; in which 
case it may doe good, if the stomack 
be not too weake. 
 
Silver, Iron, Tinne, Lead, are accounted 
cold, and by reason of their 
astringencie, to be at least in the second 
degree. Gold is likewise placed 
amongst these, though a man 
might perhaps with better right account 
it temperate. Now in regard 
of this varietie, some springs are called 
Nitrous, Sulphurous, Bitaminous, 
Aluminous, & c. according to the onely 
or predomina~t minerall, of which 
they doe participate. But yet some 
there are, in which it is a very difficult 
matter to know the same. So the 
Vberlingunians in Suevia doe dispute 
to this day, whether their minerall 
Spring proceed of Lead or Copper. 
In like manner, the Italians are not 
well agreed whether the vertue of 
the mineral water about Lucca commeth 
from Iron or from Allum. 
And a great man, that was one of the 
[^p.34^] 
chiefest Chymists of this age, doubted 
whether he should call the Empsenses 
Aquæ Aluminous or Nitrous; 
so hard a thing it is exactly to distinguish 
in things, that are compounded 
and permixt. But it is now time 
we should goe to Tunbridge water. 
 
[}CHAPTER VI. 
Of Tunbridge Water.}] 
 
THe water commonly knowne 
here amongst vs by the name 
of Tunbridge water, are two 
small Springs contiguous together, 
about some foure miles Southward 
from the towne of Tunbridge in Kent, 
from which they haue their name, 
as being the nearest Towne in Kent 
to them. They are seated in a valley 
compassed about with stony hills, 
so barren, that there groweth nothing 
[^p.35^] 
but heath vpon the same. Iust 
there doe Kent and Sussex meete, 
and one may with lesse than halfe a 
breath runne from those Springs into 
Sussex. 
 
It pleased our gracious Queene 
Marie to grace this Water by her 
presence two yeares agoe, so that 
those Springs may justly be called, 
as some doe call them now, Queene 
Maries Wells. The taste of the water 
is not vnpleasant to those, who 
haue a while beene vsed to it, and it 
is a sure thing, that no man is able to 
drinke halfe so much of any other 
liquor, though never so pleasant vnto 
him, as he may of this, What other 
mineralls it runneth through, 
besides Iron and the rubrick of Iron, 
which is seene on the ground, over 
which the water runneth, is not yet 
well knowne, for there hath beene 
as yet no digging neare about the 
same. The greater part of those that 
drinke of it, are purged by stoole, 
[^p.36^] 
and some by vomit, as well as by vrine, 
which perhaps should argue 
some other mineralls, besides Iron. 
The same may peradventure be discovered 
in after times. Howsoever 
thought there were no other mineralls 
thereabout, besides Iron, yet 
Iron being a mettall, and all mettals, 
according to the Chymicks, proceeding 
of two principles, Sulphur and 
Mercury, wheresoever there are any 
mettalls bred, there must also of necessitie 
their principles be. 
 
Besides this, all mettalls haue also 
their peculiar salts, and Iron in particular 
hath a great deale of volatill 
salt, which is it that dissolveth in the 
Chalybeate wine now so much in vse. 
Now Iron is of an astringent and 
corroborating facultie, and hath an 
opening vertue withall, as may be 
seene by the powder of steele (steele 
being nothing but a defected Iron) 
which is vsed with good successe in 
the greene sicknesse, and in all other 
[^p.37^] 
diseases proceeding from obstructions. 
But here I shall seeme perhaps 
to some to contradict my selfe, in 
making Iron both astringent and opening, 
which the vulgar thinke to 
be two qualities inco~patible in one 
subject, and yet they are deceived, 
for to open and corroborate haue 
no such repugnance, but that they 
are together in many Simples. Now 
co~cerning those two Springs, a question 
often arise amongst those 
who are there a drinking, which of 
them should be the better and stronger, 
but being so contiguous and 
neare together, certainly there can 
be no manifest ods betwixt them, 
and though I often tasted of both 
immediately one after the other, 
yet can I not say, that I ever found 
any perceptible difference betwixt 
them. Yet will I not denie, but that 
it may so fall out, that at sometimes 
the one may appeare stronger than 
the other, according as the Water 
[^p.38^] 
may participate more of the vertue 
of the mineralls at one time, than at 
another; But I thinke that there can 
be nothing constant in it, though 
they may alternatiuely something 
differ one from another. This shall 
suffice to haue beene spoken concerning 
those Springs. It followeth 
now that we make an enumeration 
of the chiefest diseases their water 
may be vsed for, wherein wee will 
chiefly follow experience, seeing it 
is an empiricall remedy, & yet so, as 
we shall not exclude reaso~. For albeit 
it be empericum remedium, yet must 
we not vse it altogether empirically, 
nor make it a Panpharmacon, or a Panacea, 
a medicine for all diseases, and 
send thither promiscuously all sorts 
of Patients, as some Physitians doe 
to the like Springs, when they are at 
a nonplus with them, and after a long 
time can doe no good vpon them in 
Chronicall diseases; For then they 
send them to those minerall waters, 
[^p.39^] 
tanquam ad sacram anchoram. Which 
causeth those Springs to become infamous, 
and to loose the credit they 
justly deserue (the common people 
ordinarily judging of things by the 
event) when some miscarry after the 
vse of the same, either because they 
were alreadie too farre spent when 
they were sent thither, or by reason 
their diseases were not to be cured 
by that remedie. 
 
[}CHAPTER VII. 
The chiefest diseases, against which 
Tunbridge water may be vsed 
with good successe.}] 
 
BEing now to reckon vp the 
chiefest diseases, which Tunbridge 
water is good for, wee 
will not goe a capite ad calcem, from 
the head to the heele, but beginne at 
that, which it is most generally good 
for, and that is obstructions, which 
[^p.40^] 
are the causes of infinite diseases. 
This water then doth effectually open 
all manner of obstructions, 
wheresoever they be lurking, and 
especially the obstructions of the 
mesaraicall veines, of the spleene, and 
of the liver, and that better, then any 
Apozemes or other physick whatsoever. 
For those obstructions being 
stubborne, and requiring a great 
deale of Physick to be removed, and 
Physicke being both loathsome and 
chargeable, people grow weary of 
it, before a Physitian shall haue run 
a quarter of the course, which is necessary 
for the remooving of those 
obstructions; and that is the reason 
that so many are troubled with chronicall 
lingering diseases, which in 
their owne nature are not incurable; 
but onely remaine vncured, either 
because the Patient is not able or 
willing to vndergoe such a course of 
Physicke, as is requisite for his recovery, 
or because hee loveth his 
[^p.41^] 
purse too well. But these Waters 
bring no charges, and after one hath 
beene vsed a little while to them, 
the taking of them is not troublesome 
at all, but the longer a man 
continueth the vse of them, the more 
he may, and being taken in a large 
quantitie, they cannot chuse but open 
effectually. Wherefore they are 
of excelle~t vse for all diseases, which 
haue their dependencie vpon obstructions, 
as all long and tedious agues, 
quartanes, and the like; for a 
dropsie, the blacke & yeallow jaundice, 
the Schirrhus Lienis, or hard 
swelling of the spleene, which the 
common people call an ague cake, 
the scurvie, the greene sicknesse, the 
whites in women, and the defect and 
excesse of their courses. And albeit 
this last assertion seemeth to haue 
some repugnancie, in that we ascribe 
two contrary effects to one and the 
same agent, yet there is no such matter, 
for the one is done by opening 
[^p.42^] 
of obstructions, and the other either 
by cooling the bloud, when it is too 
hot and sharpe, and so provoketh 
nature to expulsion, or by corroborating 
& strengthning the retentiue 
facultie. And it is the propertie of 
all equivocall agents to varie their 
operations according to the varietie 
of their objects, and of the matter 
they worke vpon; so the Sunne melteth 
Waxe, and hardeneth Clay. 
This water doth also cut and extenuate 
tough, clammy, and (if I may 
so speake) Tartarean flegme, and in 
that regard it may be much available 
for those, who are vsed to be 
troubled with the Colicke, when 
such an humor is contained in their 
gutts. 
 
It scowreth and cleanseth all the 
passages of vrine, and therefore is 
good against the gravell & the stone 
in the kindneyes, Vreteres or bladder, 
where also it dissolveth and washeth 
away a kinde of clammy flegmatick 
[^p.43^] 
exreme~t bred in the bladder, which 
sometimes stopping the passage of 
ones water, maketh him beleeue that 
he is troubled with the stone, as 
happened to one, that was himselfe 
a very skilful and famous stone-cutter, 
who being fully perswaded that 
he had a stone in his bladder, gaue 
himselfe to another of the same professio~ 
to be cut at Namurs; But when 
he was cut, nothing was found in his 
bladder, but such a tough humour, 
which might haue beene dissolved 
and voyded with facilitie by the 
helpe of the Spa water, which was 
but a dayes journey from him. It is 
good also (in regard of the astringent 
and healing facultie it hath) for all 
inward vlcers, and especially for 
those of the kidneyes and bladder, 
and of the Musculus sphinater, which 
openeth and shutteth the same. And 
in confirmation thereof divers haue 
bin cured of a bloudy vrine, which 
had long troubled them, & amongst 
[^p.44^] 
the rest a worthy Kentish Gentleman, 
with whom I went thither the 
last yeare. 
 
It is good also against all inveterate 
Dysenteries or bloudy Flixes: 
as also all other Fluxes of the belly, 
whether it be Leienteria, Diarrhæa, 
or Fluxus hepaticus. It doth likewise 
extinguish all inward inflamations 
and hot distempers, and yet for all 
that the stomacke is no whit hurt by 
the actuall coldnesse thereof, but rather 
corroborated and strengthned, 
and appetite provoked, yea in some 
but too much, as in my selfe for one; 
For whensoever I dranke either at 
the Spa or at Tunbridg, I was never able 
to fast with patience vntill noon, 
but must needs offam latranti stomacho 
offerre, cast a bit to my barking 
stomack, before the rest of my company 
went to dinner. For this cause 
when I was at the Spa, a Spanish Physition, 
who was come thither with 
the yong Prince Doria (who was then 
[^p.45^] 
but a youth) would not let him take 
the water aboue two or three dayes, 
when he saw such an effect in him, 
fearing that he would receiue more 
hurt by the excesse of his appetite, 
than benefit by the water; and so after 
a long and troublesome journey 
from Italy thither, he returned home 
without any profit. The nerues or 
finewes, and the originall of them, 
the braine, are strengthened by the 
vse of this water, and consequently 
it is good against the palsie, inclination 
to an apoplexy, lerhargie, and 
such like diseases of the head. 
 
And some Paralyticks haue beene 
seene, who sometimes voyed all 
their water by vrine, and at other 
times were as effectually purged, 
as if they had taken a strong potion, 
and withall sweated aboundantly 
all their body over. All there evacuations, 
and vomitting also, are 
sometimes seene in other diseases, as 
well as in that; Nay besides that in 
[^p.46^] 
some women you shall haue an evacuation 
by vrine, & per menses simul 
& hæmorrhoidas. The cause of all 
Rheumes and Distillations is likewise 
remooved by the helpe of this 
water, and all diseases cured, which 
haue their dependencie vpon the 
same, for all that verse of Schola Salernitana, 
 
Iejunes, vigiles, sitias, sic rheumata 
cures. 
 
Convulsions also, Head-ach, Migraime, 
& Vertigo, are driven away 
by the vse of the same, if the patient 
be constant and not too soone weary. 
Against vomitting and the hickot, 
it is vsed with good successe. 
Those that are troubled with hypochondriacall 
melancholie find a great 
deale of ease by this water. It helpeth 
also the running of the reines, 
whether it be Gonorrhea simplex or 
Venerea, and the distemper of the 
[^p.47^] 
parastatæ arising from thence, as likewise 
a certaine carnositie, which 
groweth sometimes in the conduite 
of the vrine, nay and the Poxe also, 
the water having notable potentiall 
drying facultie. It driveth away 
besides all manner of wormes, whether 
they be ordinary ones, or ascarides 
or tæniæ. It may be vsed also 
for the Gowt, but it must be with 
some caution, and the body must be 
extraordinarily well prepared and 
purged before, because it hath somtimes 
brought the fit vpon some, 
who were well when they came thither. 
Outwardly applied it doth 
helpe sore eyes, red pimples, and other 
externall infirmities. More diseases, 
which haue affinity with these, 
it may be vsed for, but I will content 
my selfe with this enumeration 
of the aforesaid ones, and passe to 
the time, manner, and order of taking 
the water. Yet must I not forget 
in the behalfe of women, to tell 
[^p.48^] 
them that there is nothing better against 
barrennesse, and to make them 
fruitfull, if other good and fitting 
meanes, such as the severall causes 
shall require, be joyned with the water. 
 
[}CHAPTER VIII. 
Of the time, manner, and order of taking 
Tunbridge Water.}] 
 
SOme that shall reade the next 
foregoing Chapter, will perhaps 
say, that I make this water 
a direct Panpharmacon, a remedie 
for all diseases, and therefore wiil 
giue small credite vnto it. But for 
all that, daily experience doth, and 
if it continue to be vsed, will more 
and more confirme what I haue said 
to be true. For very few of those, 
who liue at the Spa (whose Water 
hath great affinitie with that of Tunbridge) 
[^p.49^] 
and in the Country about it, 
and make that Water their ordinary 
drinke, as many doe, and my selfe 
haue seene there very aged people, 
that did never drinke any thing else; 
few of them, I say, are troubled with 
headach, heart-burning, stone, obstructions 
of the kidneyes, liver, or 
spleene, falling sicknesse, & the like, 
and as for the Iaundise, Dropsie, and 
Scabbes, they doe not know what 
they are. My selfe during my stay 
there being once rid out to take the 
ayre with a couple of Gentlemen, 
and a showre of raine comming, we 
made to a Countrey house neare 
hand to shelter our selues, and after 
the taking of a Pipe of Tobacco, I 
requested the goodman of the house 
(who was a very old man, and yet 
fresh and lustie, and with very few 
gray haires) to giue vs a cup of his 
beere, but he answered me, that he 
never had had any beere in his house, 
if we would drinke good Pouhon, it 
[^p.50^] 
was at our service, and he had a fresh 
vessell of it abroach. Pouhon is the 
name of that Spring of the Spa, 
which standeth in the middle of the 
Towne, and by the same name they 
call also the Water thereof. But to 
returne to our matter, 
 
Temporibus medicina valet, data 
tempore prosunt, 
Et data non apto tempore, vina nocent. 
 
and so water. The time then of taking 
those waters, is either the season 
of the yeare, when to come to 
them, or the time of the day, when 
to drinke of the same Concerning 
the season of the yeare, Sommer is 
the fittest, when there is a settled 
warme and dry weather,as in the 
dog dayes especially. 
 
Cum Canis arentes findit hiulcus 
agros. 
 
[^p.51^] 
And the chiefest moneths be Iune, 
Iuly, August, and September, although 
the Dutch, who naturally loue good 
Beere and Wine better than Water, 
vse to haue this riming verse in their 
mouthes, 
 
Mensibus in quibus R. non debes 
bibere Water. 
 
And according as the yeare prooveth, 
a man may sometimes come 
sooner, and continue later. In generall, 
whensoever the weather is 
cleare and dry, the water is then best, 
as well in the Winter, as in Summer, 
yea in hard frostie weather the Water 
is commonly strongest, the antiperistasis 
of the ayre hindering that 
there is not so great an evaporation 
of the minerall spirits of the Water. 
For when the weather is rainy or 
misty, and that Iupiter doth per cribrum 
mingere, pisse through a sieue, 
as Aristophanes merrily speakes, the 
[^p.52^] 
water looseth much of its vertue. 
My selfe haue knowne at the Spa a 
Friar of the reformed order of Saint 
Frauncis, a good honest temperate 
man, who assured me, that having 
beene there three whole yeares together 
continually for the stone (of 
which he shewed me a boxe almost 
full, of severall formes and bignesse) 
and taking the Water all the while, 
both sommer and winter, when the 
weather was seasonable, he found 
divers times the water better, stronger, 
and of a more speedy passage in 
frostie weather, then in the middle 
of Sommer, without ever perceiving 
any inconvenience by the water, 
no more at that time, then in 
Sommer, for all he did alwayes 
drinke it cold. 
 
For some that vse to take it in cold 
weather, doe warme it, but sure the 
water cannot chuse by that meanes 
but loose a great deale of its vertue, 
which in the warming evaporateth 
[^p.53^] 
away, seeing that in the very transporting 
of it, the same doth happen. 
When the Spa water is bottled to be 
sent away, albeit those who haue the 
charge of it, be never so carefull in 
stopping the Bottles close with boyled 
Corke, and pitching them over, 
yet will the minerall spirits finde 
way, in so much, as when you come 
to open them, you shall still finde 
some want, and sometimes a prettie 
deale, especially of the water of the 
Savenier, which is more subtile and 
spirituall, than that of Pouhon. But 
to returne to the matter, there is no 
more to be said, but that in a word 
the Water is alwayes best when the 
weather is clearest and driest. 
 
Now concerning the time of the 
day, the morning, when the Sunne 
is an houre more or lesse, high, is the 
fittest time to drinke the water. For 
when the Sunne beginneth to be of 
force, it doth attract some of the minerall 
spirits, and the water looseth 
[^p.54^] 
some of its strength; and betimes in 
the morning it is also best walking. 
And you are so to drinke the water, 
as you may haue taken the quantitie, 
which you intend to take that 
day, within as small a space of time, 
as conveniently you can, without 
oppressing your stomack too much, 
as within an houre, or lesse, if you 
be able. Those that lye not too very 
farre from the Springs, and are able 
to vse their legges, shall doe better 
to come thither afoote, than to ride, 
because so they shall heate their bodies 
more. Yet doe I not intend they 
should be so hot, as to sweate, or to 
be readie to sweate, for that would 
doe hurt, but I meane onely that 
their naturall heate should be something 
awaked and excited, because 
then the water will be the better attracted, 
and haue the more speedie 
passage. After every glasse, or every 
two or three glasses, according as 
you shall be able to take it, it will be 
[^p.55^] 
good to take a few Carraway comfits, 
or Coriander-seede, some Galingall, 
Zedoar, Elycampane, Angelica-roote, 
or such like, to helpe the digestion 
and passage of the Water. 
In some it is necessary, that they 
should haue some Electuary, Lozenges, 
or the like, appropriated to the 
griefe, for which they take the Water. 
 
Diverse doe take Tobacco after 
their water, which I doe not dislike, 
especially if they hold it a good 
while in their mouthes, before they 
puffe it out. Moderate exercise after 
it is very available, but I vtterly 
dislike it, if it be too violent, as running, 
leaping, jumping, as some in 
wantonnesse vse to doe. For that 
kinde of exercise is rather a hinderance, 
than a helpe, to the digesting 
of their water, and many times all 
the good it doth, is to bring it vp againe, 
weakening by that meanes 
their stomacke, which in vomitting 
[^p.56^] 
doth alwayes suffer. True it is that 
if the stomacke be foule, it is not amisse 
sometimes so to doe, and I am 
not against it. After you haue taken 
your full quantitie, it will doe well 
to walke and stirre there vp and 
downe, and to compose your selfe 
to mirth with the rest of the companie; 
For those that looke to reape 
benefit by Tunbridge, must turne away 
all cares and melancholy. 
 
In your returne to your lodging, 
I hold it better to ride, than to goe 
afoote, because sitting vpon your 
horse, the inward parts, as the muskles 
of the belly, the guttes, and the 
stomacke it selfe are thereby borne 
vp and contracted, and by the jogging 
of the horse moderately stirred, 
and so consequently your water 
will be the better digested. The 
signe of the through-concoction of 
the same is commonly when your 
vrine beginneth to haue a tincture 
and to be coloured, and then may 
[^p.57^] 
you goe to dinner; But of this wee 
will speake of purpose when wee 
come vpon diet. I saide before, that 
the best time of the day to take the 
water was betimes in the morning, 
and I meane also it should be the 
onely time for that day. For I haue 
knowne some, who tooke it twice a 
day, namely, in the afternoone also, 
but I could never approue of it, and 
my reaso~ is, that if they take it soone 
after dinner, their meate will not be 
digested, and the water forcing to 
make way for it selfe, will draw 
with it the Chylus raw and vnconcocted, 
and so cause crudities and 
obstructions, which will doe a great 
deale more hurt, than the water can 
doe them good; And if they take it 
later after dinner, their water will 
not bee digested before Supper. 
Once a day then is enough, least you 
haue worse speede by making too 
much haste. Now for the whole 
quantitie of the water to be taken in 
[^p.58^] 
one morning, it is a thing, which 
cannot justly be defined, in regard 
of the difference of bodies in age, 
sexe, strength, and other circumstances; 
But generally those that 
are able to drinke most, receiue the 
most benefit, so that they doe digest 
and voyde their water well. And 
here it is, if any where, that the 
Greeke Proverbe should take place, 
[^GREEK OMITTED^] aut bibe, aut abieither 
drinke, or be gone; If you cannot 
tipple, this is no place for you. Yet 
must every man ever haue this generall 
rule in memorie, a juvantibus & 
lædentibus optima judicatio, the best 
judication or direction is from those 
things, which doe good, and from 
such as doe hurt. You shall see some 
that arise to a great quantitie, and 
 
Invenies illic, qui Neftoris ebibat 
annos, 
 
Three hundred ounces, according 
[^p.59^] 
to Nestors yeares. Yea, and some a 
greater quantitie. And it is a thing, 
that will make the very wome~ there 
filling the glasses to laugh, to see 
some patients sent thither by ignorant 
Physitians, and appointed to 
take ten or twelue ounces of water, 
and arise perhaps to twentie or thirtie 
ounces. But this may be a rule 
for a body of competent yeares and 
strength to beginne at thirtie, fortie, 
or fiftie ounces, and to arise by degrees, 
increasing their quantitie every 
day, to an hundreth, an hundreth 
and fiftie, or two hundred ounces, 
more or lesse, as they shall be able, 
and so againe to decline and decrease 
by degrees, ending where they began, 
when they are to leaue the water. 
 
As for the time of every mans stay 
there, it is a thing which cannot be 
defined; for in some diseases some 
weekes suffice, in others diverse 
months are not enough, nay in some 
[^p.60^] 
they haue neede to come thither the 
next yeare, and the next to that too. 
This I hope will suffice for the time, 
manner, and order of taking Tunbridge 
water, I will now passe to the 
preparation of the body of such as 
are to take it. 
 
[}CHAPTER IX. 
Of the preparation of the body of 
such as are to take the Water.}] 
 
I Haue set downe before the chiefest 
diseases, which may be cured 
by the helpe of this water, 
but I am not so to be vnderstood, as 
though I meant that the water alone 
were sufficient for the same in all of 
them, without any other helpes. 
For albeit this be an empiricall remedie, 
yet must it not be vsed altogether 
empirically, but with reason, discretion, 
[^p.61^] 
and circumspection, otherwise 
hurt, rather than good, will follow 
the vse of it. Many haue falne 
into diseases, as feavers and agues, 
by coming vnadvisedly and vnprepared 
to those waters, although, 
as we said before, there is nothing 
better for agues, then they are, if 
they be rightly and advisedly vsed, 
the body being first prepared and 
purged. For although bloud by a 
sole distemper of heate may cause a 
feaver, yet cannot the other humors 
doe it, as [/29./] Galen well observeth, 
vnlesse they putrifie, which they 
will not doe if the body be free from 
obstructions, and perspirable, and 
therefore that body, which is to be 
taken with an ague, must first be obstructed. 
Now these waters being 
very diureticall, when they meete 
with a foule body, having a repletion 
of grosse humors, they easily and 
speedily carry the same with them 
into the veines, which not being able 
[^p.62^] 
to giue passage to such a quantity 
of humors, they are thereby obstructed 
and stopped, and those humors 
being there retained and wedged 
in, and not perflated or ventilated, 
they inflame and putrifie, and so 
produce a putride feaver or ague. 
Wherefore those that loue their 
health and life, must before they 
vse the water, if they haue not a 
very pure body, prepare and purge 
the same to prevent all inconveniences. 
 
Now according as bodies doe 
differ in sexe, age, temperature, 
qualitie of the peccant humour, and 
other circumstances, so must they 
accordingly diversly be prepared 
and purged. And in that regard we 
haue not thought it good to set 
downe here any formes thereof, but 
referre those that shall come to the 
water, to the advise and counsell of 
learned, and skilfull Physitions, and 
such as are withall well acquainted 
[^p.63^] 
with those kinde of waters, which is 
the maine point. And as for those, 
that come farre off, they may take 
Physicke at Tunbridge, and it will be 
best for them so to doe, because if 
they take Physicke before, and presently 
travell vpon the same, it may 
produce some danger. 
 
If the resort to the Water continue, 
and that there be competent 
company at the same, I doe purpose 
by the grace of God to be there every 
Sommer (for it is a place I like) 
and if any be pleased to conferre 
with me, I will be readie to afford 
them my best counsell; and they 
shall finde there varietie of Physicke 
appropriated to the severall diseases 
which the Water is to be vsed for. 
Neither is it enough to prepare the 
body and take Physick before comming 
to the Water, but it is requisite 
also, in some diseases, to take something 
now and then during the time 
they vse the Water, to helpe the 
[^p.64^] 
working of it, and to cause a happie 
and prosperous effect by the same, 
and so much the more, because some 
are not able, either by reason of businesse, 
or otherwise, to stay there a 
competent time, and therefore haue 
need of some other helpe. For some 
diseases are so stubborne and difficult 
to be eradicated, that we must 
fight at all weapons against the 
same, and yet all little enough too. 
Some vnlookt for accidents also 
happen there sometimes, which 
haue neede to be redressed and holpen 
by other meanes. But of these 
things neither my selfe, nor any man 
else, can speake but in generall 
termes, and therefore I will conclude, 
and passe to the dyet requisite 
to be observed there. 
 
[^p.65^] 
[}CHAPTER X. 
Of the Dyet to be observed by those 
that vse Tunbridge Water.}] 
 
DYet amongst Physitians is taken 
in a larger signification, 
that it is with the vulgar, for 
besides meate and drinke, it comprehendeth 
ayre, motion, and quiet, 
things retained and voyded, sleeping 
and watching, and the passions 
of the minde. All these must be 
rightly ordered, both to preserue, 
and to restore health. As for ayre, 
it must be taken such as it is found 
there, and I thinke there is no great 
exception to be taken against it, being 
thereabout pure and wholesome 
enough. Of motion and quiet wee 
haue said something before, when 
we spake of exercise, as also of the 
passions of the minde, when we wished 
all such as come to the Water, 
[^p.66^] 
to compose and frame themselues 
to mirth, and to leaue all cares and 
melancholy at home. Concerning 
sleeping & watching, a moderation 
must be observed therein, though it 
be better to sleepe something too 
much, then to watch too long, and 
therefore you shall doe well to Sup 
betimes, and to goe to bed betimes, 
animo securo, quieto & libero, that the 
first, second, and third concoction 
may be ended, before you take the 
water. And as for things voyded 
and retained, you must endevour to 
haue the benefite of nature by all 
manner of ordinary evacuations, as 
by stoole and vrine, and the private 
excrements of the braine, at the 
mouth and nose. And thus much in 
briefe concerning those things, wee 
will now come to meate and drinke. 
Bread is commonly, and with most 
men, the chiefest part of foode, and 
therefore though alwayes, yet here 
more especially, you must haue a 
[^p.67^] 
care to haue bread of good pure 
wheate, well handled and seasoned 
in the making, and well baked; For 
the excrements & ill humors, which 
are heaped by the vse of ill bread, 
are worse than those, which proceed 
from meate. Ravell bread generally 
is wholesomer, than manchet, and 
not so apt to breede obstructions, 
having some of the branne left in it, 
which is detergent, and maketh it 
passe the better. As for meate, let 
every one feede vpon that, which he 
hath beene most vsed to, so it be 
good meate, yeelding good nourishment, 
and of easie digestion, and let 
him shunne the vse of sawces, which 
haue much butter & spices in them. 
For it was a good admonition of 
Disarius, a learned Physitian, in 
[/30./] Macrobius, Vitandos esse cibos, qui 
vltra sitim & famem appetentiam producerent, 
that those meates were to 
be avoyded, which did lengthen 
appetite beyond hunger and thirst. 
[^p.68^] 
If you can, be you contented with 
one dish at a meale, for multa fercula 
multos morbos ferunt, many dishes 
bring many diseases, and perniciosa 
sentina est abdomen insaturabile, an 
vnsatiable belly is a pernicious sinke. 
In foule bodies especially, over-feeding 
doth a great deale of hurt, according 
to that Aphorisme of [/31./] Hippocrates, [^GREEK OMITTED^]. 
The more you nourish foule bodies, the 
more you hurt them. In a word, 
a moderate sober dyet is alwayes 
best, but especially here. As for the 
kinds of meate, albeit amongst the 
flesh of fourefooted beasts, Porke 
and Veale be chiefly commended in 
our bookes, yet here in regard of 
their moisture, I preferre Mutton 
before them. And if Porke be to be 
avoyded much more Pigge, Lambe, 
and such like flashy meate. As for 
Beefe, though it be discommended 
by most Authors, yet good Beefe, 
[^p.69^] 
well fed, and of an indifferent age, 
may be vsed without scruple, especially 
by such as haue beene accustomed 
to it, for those Authors were 
never acquainted with our English 
Beefe. If Oxen indeede be killed 
when they are so olde, that they be 
past labour, their flesh cannot be 
wholesome, nor is to be commended. 
But for our good succulent 
Beefe here, I verily thinke, that if 
those Authors were aliue againe, 
and should taste of it, they would be 
so farre from forbidding it, that to 
the contrary they would commend 
it. For if they doe so much commend 
Veale, I see no reason they can 
haue to discommend good succulent 
Beefe. 
 
Besides Mutton and Beefe, you 
may sometimes haue Capons, 
Hens, Pullets, Chickens, Pigeons, 
Partridges, Pheasants, black-birds, 
and other small birds, Rabets, and 
the like. And because some Hares 
[^p.70^] 
are sometimes caught about Tunbridge, 
it is a question, which some 
aske, whether those who are there 
at the waters, may feed vpon them. 
They are growne infamous and banished 
from most Tables vndeservedly, 
out of a conceit that they are 
melancholy meate. But I will now 
take their cause in hand, and vindicate 
them from that imputation, if I 
can, saying with Martial, 
 
Inter aves turdus, si quis, me ludice, 
certet, 
Inter quadrupedes gloria prima lepus. 
 
And least I seeme to giue too easie 
an assent to the Poet, (though he 
was not a meere Poet, but well 
grounded in naturall Philosophie) 
I will striue to proue, that it is not 
melancholy meate, but meate for 
melancholy men. 
 
First, I will bring in [/32./] Galen to patrocinate 
[^p.71^] 
vnto him, who preferres 
the bloud of a Hare, before that of 
Hens, Pigeons, and all other birds, 
and saith that it is most sweete and 
daintie. Now if Hares bloud be so 
good, how can the flesh thereof be 
nought, which is made and produced 
by it, flesh being nothing else 
but bloud coagulated and converted 
into the same? 
 
The same Author [/33./] saith also, that 
Hares flesh breedeth better bloud, 
than Mutton or Beefe. And if these 
two come every day to the Tables 
even of the noblest and richest persons, 
why should the poore Hare, 
which is better, and yeeldeth better 
nourishment then they, be banished 
from the same? 
 
After Galen, learned Heurnius reckoneth 
Hares flesh in the first place 
amongst those meates, which alter 
melancholy in the kidneyes, but to 
alter and free from melancholy, and 
to breede melancholy, cannot both 
[^p.72^] 
be done by one kinde of meate. For 
if any man would flie here to similitude 
of substance, or to an hidden 
propertie, he should deserue to be 
hissed at. But they say it is melancholy 
fearefull creature. What reason 
they haue to call him so, vnlesse 
it be because he shunneth & runneth 
away from the dogs, which pursue 
him, I doe not know; But if that be 
all, doe not Wolues, Bulls, Beares, 
yea and Lyons also, the like? If wee 
may beleeue those, who haue beene 
in Africa, an old woman there, or a 
childe with a sticke in their hands 
doe driue away Lyons, as wee doe 
dogs here. And a Hare is not so 
fearefull, but that you shall see some 
of them turne about, and looke vpon 
the dogs after a daring manner. 
They doe not lye in holes and burrowes, 
as Conies doe, which in that 
regard should be more melancholy, 
and yet they are in most common 
vse amongst vs, and accounted the 
[^p.73^] 
best meate. And as for their foode, 
it is the same with that of Partridges, 
the excellencie whereof is no 
where controverted, and with the 
vse of them onely the Poxe may be 
cured, as Cardan holdeth, who could 
speake of it by experience, as having 
had that disease seven times, as himselfe 
witnesseth in that booke of his, 
which he entitleth De vtilitate ex 
adversis capienda; and sure his witnesse 
is not to be rejected. Let the 
Hare then returne in vse, and be readmitted 
to his former preheminence, 
so he be not too old, but of 
a competent age, as of a yeare or 
lesse. But as for water-foule, you 
shall doe well to abstaine from the 
same. 
 
Concerning fish, though it be for 
the most part vnwholesome, and apt 
to breede excrementitious and slimie 
humors, yet for a change you may 
sometimes eate some river-fish, that 
is firme and not slimie, as Trouts, 
[^p.74^] 
Gudgeons, Pikes, Perches, and the 
like, either broyled, or boyled in 
Wine (if you will goe to the charges) 
rather than in Water, and corrected 
with Fenell, Spearemints, 
Thyme, Rosemary, Parsley or the 
like. But for Mints in particular, let 
those women, that come to the water 
for fruitfulnesse, refraine the 
same, because it is thought it hindereth 
conception. At your fruit you 
may vse some Raisins of the Sunne, 
a bit of Marmelade, a roasted Wardon, 
or Pepin mith Carrowayes, or 
the like; But in all this you must be 
sparing. 
 
Now for and end of all, I must repeat 
what I haue touched before, 
namely, that you avoyde varietie of 
dishes. For the nature of severall 
meates being diverse,and sometimes 
cleane opposite and contrary one to 
another, & some sooner concocted, 
and other later, from hence those evills 
will arise, against which you 
[^p.75^] 
come to seeke helpe from the water, 
as crudities, wind-gripings, paine of 
the reines, obstructions of the mesaraicall 
veines, rawnesse of the Chylus, 
and consequently of the bloud, 
which shall be made of the same, 
and such like inconveniences, which 
by a sober and moderate dyet may 
be avoyded. 
 
Thus much concerning meate. As 
for drinke, good ordinary cleare 
Beere, and of an indifferent strength 
and age, is best, and it is the ordinary 
drinke of this Island, and which agreeth 
best with the nature of those 
which are bred in it. Yet if any having 
beene vsed to drinke Wine at 
meales, desire to continue the same, 
I am not against it, if so be they be 
not of too hot a constitution, and 
haue no principall part offended 
through excesse of heate; For a cup 
of Wine or two at meales doth but 
helpe to make the better digestion. 
And for that purpose Sacke or Claret 
[^p.76^] 
are better than white Wine, because 
white Wine, by the diurecticall 
faculty it hath, passeth too soone 
away, and before the Chylus bee 
throughly perfected, and so it may 
carrie some of the Chylus rawe and 
vnconcocted with it, and consequently 
breede crudities and obstructions. 
And thus much concerning dyet. 
 
[}The Conclusion of this Treatise.}] 
 
HAving briefly runne through 
the chiefest things needfull 
to be knowne and practised 
by such, as shall desire to vse this 
Water, I will here end with an exhorration 
vnto them to be well advised 
concerning the nature of their 
diseases before they come, and when 
they are come, to obserue the rules 
& directions contained in this Treatise, 
as also to be constant in the vse 
[^p.77^] 
of the Water. And although perhaps 
some of them perceiue little or 
no benefite at first by the same, yet 
let them not be discouraged, but 
persevere in the vse of it. For some 
having beene there once with small 
or no profit at all, the next yeare 
after, vpon a second tryall, haue returned 
home perfectly cured. It is 
the ordinary reward of the constancie 
and perseverance in the end to hitte 
the marke they ayme at. Every 
thing in this world hath a certaine 
period, before which it cannot 
come to a full perfection. And so 
herewith I wish all happie and prosperous 
successe to all such, as shall 
come to these Springs, and will be 
readie at all times to affoord them 
my best helpe and councell. 
 
Now as for this Treatise, I doe 
not looke it should haue a priviledge 
aboue all other writings, to be exempted 
from controllement and 
carping; For it were better lucke, 
[^p.78^] 
than any man ever had, that exposed 
himselfe to the censure of the world. 
There are farre more fooles, than 
wise men in the world, and as a Spaniard 
well observeth, Vnloco haze 
ciento, one foole maketh an hundreth 
more such (most men having their 
wittes pinned vpon another mans 
sleeue) and the greater foole commonly 
is the bolder censurer, which 
maketh Bookes to be variously received, 
liked, and entertained, according 
to the varietie of the Readers 
vnderstanding and capacitie. 
 
Pro captu lectoris habent sua fata 
libelli. 
Vpon the readers wit the fates of 
Bookes depend. 
 
But the best is, that I ever was regardlesse 
of the multitude, as well in 
this, as in this, as in all things else. If the judicious 
Reader finde any just fault 
with any thing contained in this 
[^p.79^] 
Treatise, let him remember that humanum 
est errare, that to erre is incident 
to the frailtie of our humane 
nature. But I never was so wedded 
to mine owne opinions and conceptions, 
but that vpon better information, 
I ever was, and ever will be 
willing to acknowledge mine errours, 
if I committed, or shall commit 
any, without esteeming it any 
shame so to doe, no more than 
many good and worthy Authors 
haue done, when 
they published their 
retractations. 
 
[}FINIS.}]
