[^SECRETE OF SECRETES^]

|P_48 
[\f. 14r\] [}The Prologe of the Seconde Booke}] 
For sothe now Y wille teche the medycynes and other privitees 
that shall be sufficient y-now to the conservacion of thy helthe, 
so that thow shalt nede none other leche, the which conservacion 
of sanyte and of helthe is better and precioser than any medecyne, 
and they ben full necessarie to the, and to the gouernaill of the 
worlde. 
 
[}Of conservancie of helthe}] 
And vnderstonde wele that ther is no way to do no thyng by, neyther 
to gete no thynge by, but only by myght and potencie. And 
potencie is not had but by helthe. And ther is no helth, but there 
as egalnesse is of complexions. And that may not be had with-out 
attempraunce of humours and conservancie of sanite, and in 
getyng of many other thynges. And revelacion þerof was made to 
holy philosophers, the servantes of God, and to rightfull and to 
prophetis such as were chosen and lighted with the spirite of 
dyvyne sapience, and endowed them with yiftes of science. Of 
them the other philosophres that have be sithe toke thair begynnyng, 
bothe Indiens, Persiens, Grekes, and Latynes, and wrote 
vpon thair principles, of artis and sciences the secretes, for in their 
writyng is no thynge founed, no thynge reproved, but of full wise 
men approved. Who-so-euer is cause of perdicion of hym-self, 
thurgh moch spekyng, he may be cause of perdicion of others. For 
we chese that that we love, and asken that that we intenden. For 
soth, wete þow shalt that the most highest God and gloriosest, 
amonge all oþer philosophres most He illumyned the Grekes, and 
inflamed them with knowyng and getyng of sciences and of the 
privetees of naturell thynges. Of these elleswhere Y made feith 
to the, wherfor here-after Y entende [\f. 14v\] to procede and purpose to 
determyne in this booke, our Lord therto grauntyng. Accorded 
for sothe ben all wise and naturel philosophres, that a man is 
componed of opposed elementes, and of 4 contrarye humours, 
that at all tymes nedith norisshyng and drynkes, the which yf he 
lak, the man is corrupted in his substaunce. And yf he vse that to 
|P_49 
oft or to scarce, he rynneth debilite of siknesse, and other inconvenientes 
many. And yf he vse it temperatly, he shall fynde 
helpe of lyf, bodely strength, and of all his substance helth. Fully 
therfore they ben accorded, that who trespasseth the due maner 
hereof, full or fastyng, slepyng or wakyng, in movyng or rest, in 
dissolucion or extencion of the wombe, or in blode-lettyng, he shall 
not escape stronge sikenesse, and wexyng infirmytees, of the which 
all and euery Y purpose to determyne vndre short congruyte, 
yevyng a full certayne doctryne vpon the kyndes of siknesse, and 
vpon thaire remedies. Also they all accorden that who can be ware 
of to moch and of to lytell, conservyng an evenesse and temperance 
in dyetyng, he shall have helth and longe lyf. For Y 
founde [{nevere{] there philosophres that discorded fro this, that 
is to sey, how that all delites and plesances of this world, 
honoures and flesshly lustes, naturely desireth to endure, wherfor 
who coueyteth forto lyve, studye he to gete to thynges þat ben 
apropred to enduryng, and tho that kepeth lyf, and renovnce he 
the lustes of his propre wille and flesshly desires, and be ware all 
way of superfluous and crapulous surfetes in etyng [{and{] drynkyng. 
For Y herde sey that Ypocras kept a diete and surfete therby in 
maner of feblenesse of his body, and a disciple of hys spake thus 
to hym, ‘O worthy doctour, yf thow woldest ete wele, thow 
sholdest not suffre so moche feblenesse of thy body.’ Ypocras 
aunswered thus, ‘Sone, Y ete for to lyve, but Y lyve not for to ete. 
Foode is had forto endure with, not enduryng for foode.’ 
 
‘Truly,’ seid he, ‘I have know full many that while they lyved 
they dem[{y{]n[{u{]ed þ[{ai{]r foode, and absteyned tham fro comestions 
and of other flesshly appetites, sparyng glotonye, lyvyng 
temperatly by dyetyng, wher-thurgh [\f. 15r\] they were of the most 
holest of body, of good operacion, of longe lyf, of assured appetite, 
and of good movyng.’ And this [{is{] openly proved in the 
Arrabiens and in tham that oft walked in wildernesse and desertis. 
|P_50 
Therfor it is an open argument that abstinence fro comestions, 
fro constipacions and superfluyte, is the hyghest helthe. 
 
[}In how many maners is helthe conserved}] 
O Alexandre, in medecynes is conteyned the most certeyn and 
most veray techyng, that the conseruance of helth standeth principally 
in 2 thynges. First that a man vse convenient metes accordyng 
to his age, to the seson and tyme of the yere, and to the 
custume of his nature, that is to sey, that he vse such metes and 
drynkes with the which he hath be brought forth before, the which 
confermed his nature, þat is to say, that accordeth with his complexion. 
Secondly, that he be purged of all superfluous and corruptif 
humours. And vnderstande wele that the bodies of men, 
that ben receptacles of mete and drynke, ben thynned and resolued, 
as wele the bodies resceyvyng as the foode that is resceyved. 
At the first they ben resolued by the hete naturell that drieth vp 
the moisture of the bodies, and is norisshed and fedde with the 
same humydite. Resolued they ben also by the hete of the sone 
and of wynde, that drieth vp all the moistur of bodies and of 
floodes. For whan the body is hote and vaporable, than is good to 
vse grete metes, for that that is dissolued, and passeth fro the 
body, wolle be of grete quantite and of grose substance, for the 
grete hetes and vapoures of the body. And whan the bodies ben 
thynne and drye, than sotell and moist metes ben good. For that 
that is dissolued fro the body shall be of smale quantite, for his 
streite issues. Certeyn therfor be it a techyng to conseruacion of 
helthe, that a man vse metes conuenient to his complexion. 
Example of grace: if any be of hote nature, vse he temperatly 
hote metes, and if he be of cold nature, vse he temperatly colde 
metes. The same sey Y of a moist and drye bodye. Therfor yf hete 
be augmented and in-flame with to grete a swellyng, that is, than, 
other for hote metis and strong, other for hete outward lordshippyng 
and [\f. 15v\] myghtyest, than opposed and contrarye metes helpen, 
that is to sey, coolde. For grosse metes and stronge ben good to 
a stronge and an hote stomak, for it fareth as a stronge fire, that 
|P_51 
hath myght to brenne grete wode. But whan the stomak is cold 
and feble, than vse he sotell and light metes, for that stomak is 
likened to a fire that brenneth but reedis, lockers and sotell wode. 
The tokens of a good stomak ben lightnesse of the body, clernesse 
of vnderstandyng, mevyng, and good appetite. The signes of a 
bad stomak is: that [{it{] is feble of digestion by hevynesse of body, 
nesshnesse of flessh, sleuthe, swellyng of face, oft openyng of his 
mouth, gref of eyen, foule and bad rechyng and the savour to be 
sowre, dol, bitter, aiselly, watery other stynkyng, and therof ben 
engendred wyndes and swellynges in the wombe, and his appetite 
is lost. Yf the thynge be in grete quantite, therof cometh spetyng 
and strecchyng of the extremytees, reflexions of lymes, quakyng of 
the body, gapyng of the mouthe, and many other harmes that ben 
contrary to helth, and ben destructifes of the body and corruptifes 
of nature. Therfor, most clement Emperour and Kyng, thow 
sholdest full diligently kepe the fro the forseid inconveniences. 
 
[}Book 3 
Here foloweth a full profitable epistle of full grete price, 
yevyng a rule to lyve, for conservacion of helthe, in the 
which ben many necessaries of the secretes of medicyne. 
Some clepen this epistle a booke by hym-self, and it hath 
the prologe of John of Spayn that translated it out of Grewe 
and Arrabik into Latyn and sende it to Dame Thephayne, 
Quene of Spayn, vndre þis fourme: To Dame Thephayne, 
Quene of Spayn, John of Spayne sendeth gretyng, or 
helthe, &c.}] 
 
O Alexandre, sith the body is corruptible, and corrupcion happeth 
therto of opposicion of complexion and of humours that ben 
ther-yn, it is sittyng to me by this present werk to write vnto the 
some maner of profites, and at all necessary, and of secretis of the 
art of medicyne. With the which be gretly contented, sithen it is 
vnhonest that a leche shold know all the infirmytes of kynges. If 
diligently thow be-hold this exampler, and after the order of this 
full precious booke, while thow lyvest shalt nede [\f. 16r\] no leche, but yf 
plage of pestilence other woundes in fyghtyng or bataill happe tham, 
|P_52 
omwhile all may not [{be{] shoned. Therfore, Alexandre, it behoveth 
the, whan thow risest fro slepe, walke esely and strecche 
thy lymes and kembe thyn hede, for of strecchyng of thy lymmes 
is thy body strengthed, and the combyng of thy hede draweth 
out and putteth a-way all the vapours that while thow slepest 
assendeth to thyn hede. In somer wassh with colde water, and in 
wynter with hote, for tho thynges constreyneth and holden the 
vapourantes hetes of þe hede or body, and therof wolle grow desire 
of appetites to ete wele. Than clothe the with the best and softest 
clothes and array the with the best garnementis, for naturelly thy 
lyf is gladed therwith, and thy vertue and myght with fairenesse 
and shynyng of clothes is delyted and comforted. Than shalt thow 
froyte thy tethe and gomes with leves wele sauoured and hote and 
drye [{of{] nature, other with leves of grene trees of bitter nature or 
sovre. That helpeth and profiteth moch. They clenen the tethe and 
the mouthe. It melteth fleme, it clenseth the tonge and clereth the 
speche. More-ouer, it stereth appetites and wille to eete. Than 
resceyve the fvme of appropred fumygacions to the seson of the 
yere. Tha[{t{] profiteth moche, that openeth the closes of the brayn, 
and yeveth wexyng to the armes, maketh the nek fatte. It clarefieth 
þe visage and the sight, it strengtheth the 5 wittes, it shonneth and 
tarieth hoorenesse. After that, vse the best vngementis in wirchyng 
and sauour, accordyng to the seson of the yere, for with good odoure 
is the soule plesed and refeid, for that is his foode, and the soule 
comforted, the body is strengthed, the bloode rynneth and conforteth 
all the vaynes thurgh the plesaunce of the soule. Afterward 
take a pocion of a lectuary made of aloes citryn and of rvbarb of 4 
peny-weight, for that moche profiteth: it draweth flewme fro the 
mouthe of the stomak, it moveth coller, it putteth a-way ventosite, 
and yeldeth the movthe wele savoured. Afterward sitte with nobles 
and estates, and speke with wise men, after the custume of kynges 
and of prynces. And do that, that sitteth the forto do [{first{] whan 
wille of etyng cometh to the, about the hovre that thow hast vsed 
afore. [\f. 16v\] Than meve thy body with esy labour as in goyng or 
rydyng, other by some of oþer exercise, for therof wolle growe moch 
profite to the body and mervelously helpeth it. It veseth a-way and 
|P_53 
breketh all ventositees, it streng[{e{]th the body and lighteth it, it 
kyndli[{t{]h hete in the stomak, it constreyneth the joyntes of the 
body, and breketh the superflue humours, and maketh flevme descende 
to the stomak, that is a-boylyng with mete by hote and drye. 
Afterward se that many metes come before the, and of such as 
thow likest and kanst chese, ete thow accordyng to thyn appetite, 
with brede lightly reised, wele and perfitly lavayned and new and 
wele bake, and wele fro bran sarsed, meenly with salt savoured, 
settyng before that that shold be sette afore. Example of grace: 
yf thow take dissoluyng potages, it dissolueth, and retentif potages 
constreynen; but yf the resoluer be take be-fore, the constreyner, 
take after, is slippered and make light degestion and goode egestion. 
And yf thow vse the restreynyng first, the dissolver, for 
because of his soft workyng, sheweth ill after, and in maner confovndeth 
both. And yf thow vse in oone mete many nesshe and 
sleper potages that wolle sone be digested, necessarye it is that he 
take first the potage retentif, that the hete of the bothom of the 
stomake may there leve his car[{n{]osite, for the hete that is there is 
caused of the nyghnesse of the lyver, that maketh decoccion there. 
This done, me most be ware of to moche etyng, be the mete never 
so good, and withdraw the hand, while he hath appetit and desire 
to ete. For of superfluyte of mete is the stomak stopped, the body 
greved, the inwitte hurt, and the mete vndigested abideth in the 
bothom noyovs, and vndified. Also restrayne the, and be ware 
of drynkyng of water vpon thy mete, lest thow accustume it, for it 
coldeth the stomak, and restrayneth the fire, and quencheth the 
hete of digestion, confoundeth the mete, and gendreth impediment, 
specially if moch be dronke, for ther is no thynge worse than 
it to the helthe of mannes body. And yf it may [{not{] come otherwise 
but nede arteth the to drynke water, as for hethe of the tyme, 
oþer [\f. 17r\] for takyng of hote metes, other for hete of body other of 
stomak, lette it be cold, and lytell in quantite. 
 
[}Of the maner and wise of slepyng}] 
Whan thow risest from thy mete, in a sete, other in a covche, vpon 
soft strawed clothes and sotell straw, rest the, and slepe temperatly, 
|P_54 
first on thy right side, and after on the left, and theron full-fille 
thy slepe, for the lift side is colder, and nedeth þerfor more 
calefaccion. But yf thow fele eny greuance in thy stomak or wombe, 
than take a necessarye medecyne. Put on thy wombe an hevy, hote 
shert, and gripe or hull in thyn armes a fair hote maiden. And yf 
thow reche sourely, wete wele that thy stomak is coldred. To 
remedy that, drynke hote water with some eygre sirope, and it 
wolle purge vp the emprisoned mete corrupted and vndigested, 
that causeth grete distruccion of the body. Movyng and exercise 
before mete stirreth to the stomak naturell hete. But after mete it 
noyeth, for than descendith esely the mete vndecoct to the lower 
part of the stomak, and therof is gendred inclusion of wyndes, 
and many-fold of other badnesse and vnprofites. Vnderstande also 
wele, that slepyng before mete maketh a body thynne, and dryeth 
vp his moysture and consumeth it. But after mete mervelously it 
refressheth the body, filleth it, strengtheth it, and norissheth it, 
for while the man slepeth the body resteth, and than the naturell 
hete that ronne[{th{] thurgh all the body, is drawen inward to the 
stomak and to his bothom. Than is the stomak strengthed in decoccion 
of the mete, than the resonable vertue asketh his rest. 
And þerfor some philosophres seid, that eve suppers more profiteth 
the body þan noone metes, for the noone mele resceyveth the hete 
of the day whan all wittes worcheth, and the inwitte is wexed, 
so that what me hireth than, it is roted neyþer resoned, and that for 
man-is many-fold thoughtes, and many other vnprofitable inconveniences 
that cometh aboute hym thurgh hete and movyng. 
And at merydie, the naturell hete is shad by all the outward [\f. 17v\] part 
of the body, wherby the stomak is febled to digest the mete. And 
sothly in the eve souper happeth the contrarye, for the body may 
have tranquyllite of his labour, and than may rest body and soule. 
And also the nyght naturelly is cold, that dreveth the naturell hete 
to the inward part, or to the lowest, of the stomak. 
 
[}Of kepyng of vsage or of custume}] 
Also it is not [{to be unwyst{], that who that vseth to ete twyes a 
|P_55 
day, if he wold kepe o certayn houre and o certayne mele, sothly he 
shall suffre therby ano[{y{]. And so shall he that now eteth but ones 
a day, and before he was vsed to ete twies, for his stomak may not, 
ne wille not, diffie and digest his mete, and it norissheth hym not. 
For who-so-euer all-wayes before obserued a certayn houre in 
etyng and drynkyng, and he sodeynly chaungeth that houre to 
a-nother, he shall mow sone perceyve that it profiteth not his 
nature but hurteth it. For custume is a-nother nature. Therfor yf 
any necessitee that hath no lawe compelleth the to chaunge thyn 
vsage, thy dyet in etyng, do it discretly and wisely, that the 
chaunge be by lytell and lytell, o tyme after a-nother, and so with 
the helpe of God it shall be wele. And be wele ware er thow ete eft 
sones, that thy stomak be clene and voide fro the first mete, and 
that shalt thow know by thy appetite and hungery desires, and by 
thynnesse of thy spetell that sotelly wille rynne in thy mouthe. 
For who so euer taketh mete habondantly without nede of his body, 
that is with-out wille and appetite, the last eten mete shall fynde 
the naturell hete as a gelle, for the plente of coold humours that 
vndefieth the mete. So is the stomak wexed that the last take mete 
fyndeth no hete, for to moche intendyng or beynge ther-to-gedre. 
For many thynges intended, the witte is the lasse to euery of them. 
But who-so-euer eteth with good wille, desire and appetit, than þe 
mete fyndeth hete in the stomak, as fire kendeled and redy to boyle 
and digest it. And whan euer [{in{] thy stomak good appetite [\f. 18r\] 
cometh to the, forth-with yf thow maist, ete and aunswere it. For 
els ille humours wolle descende in to it, and draw downe to them 
all the superfluyte of the body, that shall trouble the brayn with 
fulle badde vapours, and afterward, whan hete cometh, the mete 
in the stomak shall be but tepide hote and vndigest, and not profiteth 
the body, but rather noyeth it and sleeth it. 
 
[}The 4 Boke that treteth of the 4 tymes of þe yere 
Of veer, somer, hervest and wynter}] 
Oure intencion in this booke is shortly for to determyne of and 
vp-on the 4 tymes of the yere, vpon the qualite and proprete 
|P_56 
of euery tyme of them, and of thair variance. For sothe, Alexandre, 
thow sholdest suerly kepe tho 4 tymes of the yere that ben thus 
distingued. 
 
[}Of veere}] 
Ueer begynneth whan the sonne entreth the signe of Aries, and 
dureth 93 daies, 23 houres and 15 minutes of an houre, that is to 
sey, it begynneth the 11 day of March and endith the 13 day of 
Juyn. At his begynnyng, day and nyght ben even of oo length. In 
regions, the tyme waxyng swete, the aier waxeth clere, softly 
blowen the wyndes, snowes dissoluen, ryvers rynnen. Amonge 
montaynes walleth welles, moysture is exhaunced to the tree toppe, 
braunches budden, sedes rysen, cornes wexen, medowes wexen 
grene. Faire and fressh ben flovres, clad with newe leves ben trees, 
the soile is arraied with herbes and grasses. Engendren bestes, 
pastures ben arraied and resumen a newe strength, briddes syngen, 
the nyghtyngale sovneth and resonett. The erth all fully resceyve[{th{] 
his garnementis and fairenesse, and is as a faire spouse 
and a full specious damysell arraied with broches, and clad with 
many-fold coloures that she may appere to me in the day of hir 
mariage. Veer also is a tyme that is hote and moist, and that 
temperatly, and is lyke to the aier. And [\f. 18v\] in it is the blode meved, 
and is shad thurgh all the parties of the body, and ther-in profiteth 
all thyng that is lyke and even of complexions, that is to sey, 
temperat. And so most thy diete be in that tyme. Italiens tha[{n{] 
vsen to ete chekons, corlewes, egges (not passyng v at a mele), 
wilde betis that Arabiens clepen scariol, and then vse they to 
drynke gotis mylke. No seson of the yere is better than he, neyther 
profitabler to lettyng of blode. It is not bad to vse women ther-yn, 
so it be not ayenst the lawe, and to meve þe body, and to lose the 
wombe, to entre and to vse bathes and swetis, to drynke spices 
for digestion. And than purgacions shold be take. What-euer 
errour happe in þe medicynes, whether be it by digestion or diminvacion, 
other of to moche digestion other of inanycion, this seson 
with his humydite and habilite in party restoreth. 
|P_57 
[}Of somer}] 
Somer begynneth whan the sonne entreth the signe of the 
Crabbe, and dureth 93 dayes, 9 houres, 20 minutes of an houre, 
that is to sey [{it begynneth{] the [{xiii{] day of June and durith tille 
the 14 day of Septembre. In this tyme ben the dayes at the lengest, 
and nyghtes in all regions discresen, hetes cresen, wyndes swollen, 
tranquyllite in the [{s{]ee, clernes in the aier, cornes dryen and 
rypen, serpentes comen forth, venymes ben shad, bodily vertues 
ben strengthed, and þe world is as a spouse full in the body and age, 
with hetes swellyng. Somer tyme is hote and drye, wher-in collir 
stirreth. Me most in that seson be ware and absteyne fro all thynge 
that is hote and drye in complexion, for they wolle stirr collir. 
Fro to hote metes and drynkes, and fro crapulous etyng, me most 
absteyne, lest the naturell hete queynt therby. Ete that tyme all 
thyng that is colde and moist of complexion, as veel, with vynegre, 
or eysell, cucurbitis and pulletis ensayned, potage also made vp on 
barly floure, and frutis of egre savour, as soure apples, pome 
garnatis. [\f. 19r\] And vse scarcely veneryen actis, fro all bledyng be ware, 
and specialy in pryncipall veynes, but yf nede art it, and scarcely 
also entre bathes. Therfor ete in that tyme, as be-fore is rehersed, 
cold and moiste metes, so that with coldnesse the violence of hete, 
and with moisture the malice of drynesse, may be repressed. In 
like wise thurgh all the sesons of the yere me most with contrari[{e{]s 
cure contraries. 
 
[}Of hervest}] 
Hervest begynneth whan the sone entreth the signe of Libra 
and conteyneth 89 [{dayes{], 6 houres. This is fro the 14 day of 
Septembre vnto the 12 day of Decembre. In this tyme dayes and 
nyghtes ben lyke longe, in the seconde tourne. And here-in the 
nyght accreseth, the aier wexeth cold, the northern wyndes 
blowen, the tymes chaungen, the flodes decresen, welles dymynven, 
greves wydreth, frutis enden, the face of therth lakketh fairenesse, 
voules asken hote regions, bestes thaire dennes, serpentes 
crepen in thair holes, and theder gadre foode for the wynter. The 
world is like a woman of full age lakkyng clothes, [{l{]evyng yougth 
|P_58 
and hastyng to age. The hervest is colde and drye, wheryn ryseth 
malencoly. Me most therfor in þat seson vse hote and moiste metes 
as chekons, lambe, wyne olde and sotell, and swete grapes. Be ware 
of all thyng that gendreth malancolie, movyng of the body, and 
vsyng of veneryne actes, more than in somer. Vse þan baynes. And 
purgacions, yf nede be, in this tyme may be had and take. In this 
seson, yf me nede, me may take vomytes, and that meenly, about 
noone or whan þe day is hotest, for in such houres ben engendred 
and gadereth all superfluytees in man. Purgacion of the wombe or 
of the body shall be take that tyme, and perismon and agnaricon 
and all other thynges that draweth blak collir and repressen the 
humours of melancoly. 
 
[}Of the wynter}] 
The wynter begynneth whan the sone entreth the signe of [\f. 19v\] Caprycorne 
and conteyneth 88 dayes, 15 houres, 14 minutes, that is 
to sey, from the 12 day of Decembre, tille the 11 day of Marche. In 
this tyme the nyght is longest and the dayes shortest, colde hath 
myght, wyndes ben sharp, the leves of trees [{all{] fallen [{down{], 
all grene thynge dyen and waxen hard as stones, the most part of 
bestiall kepe tham in caves of montayns, for the most cold and 
moisture þat is than, the aier is derk, the tyme blak, the bestes 
quaken, for the seson febleth the vertues of thaire bodies. And than 
is the worlde as an olde woman, greued and decreped in age, lakkyng 
clothes, neygh to deth. The wynter is colde and moist, wher-in 
flevme is augmented, wher-in me most chaunge oure dietyng. Than 
turne to hote metes of hote matir and nature, as coluer peions, 
moton, and rosted metes, and all fat soupyng and hote metes, as 
figis, nottis and fyne rede wyne and hote letuaries. Absteyne thein 
fro lousyng of the body and lettyng of blode, but yf it nede the 
more. Vse not to moche mete, noþer venereyn actes, lest that digestion 
be febled. Than me most chaunge thaire. In chafyng of þe 
body, in enoyntyng therof, and frotyng, [{vse{] oynementis hote. 
And vse temperat bathes. It noyeth not moche in that seson to vse 
women, movyng of body, grete drynkyng, moch etyng, for because 
of cold outward the naturell hete draweth inward and causeth

good digestion. In veer and somer, the wombe is colde, and the 
povres open, and the hete is shad thurgh all the body, and 
the stomake hath litell þerof, and so digestion is letted and the 
humours moved. Vnderstande þis wele, and God kepe the, and 
farewell. O Alexandre, kepe wele þis precious prefixed diet and 
hede euery part therof. Conserve naturell hete, for as longe as 
temperat hete is in a man, and moisture not passyng the myddell, 
than therof cometh naturell hete, and than helth in lyf is like to 
abide, and so sanyte may be longe kept. For in 2 maners age 
cometh. In that one by due law and cours of nature, in wexyng 
colde, and the body wastyng and drying, and so destroying the 
creature. A-nother maner accidentall, as of sikenesse and of other 
causes, and bad cures and hedynges. 
 
[\f. 20r\] [}Of thynges that fatten the body and maken it lene}] 
These fatten and moysten the body: surete, fulsomnes of swete 
metes and of dyuerse drynkes that ben swete, as mylke and meth, 
hote drenkes other sharp, and slepyng after mete vpon soft beddes 
and the place wele savoured, accordyng to the tyme, in colde places 
and moist, and seeld entre into swete bathes of fressh water and 
litell tariyng ther-in, that the body take moysture of the bathe and 
not the bathe of the body, for thurgh tarying there the body wold 
be febled. All redolent herbes that accordeth with the helthe of 
the body loke that they be in it, as, in the wynter, wermode that 
is of hote nature; roses also and violettes, and all colde herbes, in 
the somer. A vomyte also wassheth the body and purgeth the 
stomak of all bad humours and putrified. And whan fewe humours 
be in the stomak the hete is comforted forto digest and forto dewe 
the body and yeve it humydite and fatnesse. And moche the more 
and profitabler yf he be mery and glad, and yf he myght have 
resonable glory and honoure, and of his enemyes victorye, hope 
and trust in the peple, in pleyes and sightes to delyte, to se faire 
faces and vesages, and beholde delitable bokes, and to here swete 
songes and delitable, to laugh amonge tham that loven hym, to be 
clad in the best clothyng of colour and teyntour, and to be wele 
an-oynted with the best accordyng oynementis to the tyme. Of 
|P_60
the contrarye these dryen, feblen and maken leene the body: 
to ete and drynk lytell, labour oft, and to moche stonde in the sone, 
with-out mesure walke, slepe before mete vpon hard beddes, to be 
vexed in mynd, to entre bathes there as sulphure water is, and sitte 
longe ther-yn, vse ete drye, salt, and resty mete, and to drynke full 
olde wyne oft, to take and make many seeges, oft to lette blode and 
to lak mesure ther-in, to be to besy in venerien actis, to be vexed 
with bad thoughtes, to have drede oft and sorow. All these and 
many other dryen and feblen the body. 
 
[}A rewle of Ypocras}]
If any man constipat or replete entreth bayn, or bath, the dolour 
[\f. 20v\] of ydropesye, other of the intestines and bowels, he may be sure of. 
Also who deliteth with a woman the belly full, he shall be paraletik 
yf he vse it moch. Neither is good than to rynne ne to ride moche. 
Who to-geder oft eteth fyssh and drynketh mylke with-all, lepre or 
perell in his eye it disposeth. Wyne and mylke in like wise worchen. 
This litell werk vnto Kyng Alexandre, the prynce of leches wrote, 
that he, thurgh the tenoure therof and the maners obserued, shold 
nede none other leche. 
 
[}Here foloweth the 5 Boke of the 4 pryncipall lymmes, and 
first of the passions and sikenesse of the hede and his 
remedies}] 
The body is dyvyded in 4 parties. The first part is the hede. Whan 
any superfluyte is gendred ther-in, thow maist know it by these 
signes: that is to sey, by dazovnesse of eyen, hevynes of browes, 
repercussion of the tymples, the sownyng of the eeres and stoppyng 
of the nastrels. Who-so-euer feele this happe to hym, take and 
boyle efros in pelletes in swete wyne, with the rootes of pullege, 
and wast half, and of the residue euery mornyng put a sponefull 
in thi mouth, tille thow fele that it profiteth the. And vse with thy 
mete mvstard sede of a peny weight, wele poudred, with confitis 
thurgh xij oignementes: that he vse to slepe with. If he leve that 
|P_61 
and for-yitte it, it is to be doughted of perieleus siknesse, that is 
to sey, corrupcion of his sight, dolour of his brayn, and many other 
infirmitees, fro the whiche at all tymes God kepe the. 
 
[}Of syknesse of the brest and his remedies}] 
The brest is the 2 part. If ther-in be gendred superfluytees, these 
signes foloweth: the tonge is hevy, the movth bitter, in the stomak 
moch sowrenesse, and he felith the cough. Me most therfor lisse 
etyng and drynkyng, vse vomytes, and ther-after take sugre 
roset, with a stik of aloes, and shave it, and after that take the 
quantite of a notte of the grete electuarye that is made with ligne 
aloes, vt supra. 
 
And yf thow do not so thow may lightly cacche the passions 
of thy side and reynes and rynne into an excesse and into other 
siknesses. 
 
[}Of sikenesse of the genytaill and thair medecyne}] 
[\f. 21r\] The coddes ben [{þe oþer{] parties. And yf any superfluyte be 
gadered in tham, or impediment, to lak appetit is the signe therof. 
Who feleth hym greved ther-in, he most take 2 herbes, drochachen 
and arianes, and boyle herbe and rote in white wyne, and euery 
mornyng vse it, tempered with water and hony, and absteyne fro 
moche etyng and drynkyng. 
 
And yf he leve behynde this medecyne, he may be aferde of 
dolour of coddis, of the longis, and of the stone. 
 
[}Oppynyons of philosophers}] 
It is writte in olde storyes that a myghty kyng brought to-gedre 
the best leches of Indiens, Grekis, and Medis, and Persiens, and 
enyoyned them to make hym a medecyne that, it vsed, me shall 
nede none other medecyne. Holsomly, seid the Greke, that who 
wold take euery mornyng hote water, other rose water 2 sponefull 
seuerelly, it wille cause helth and that he shall nede none other 
medecyne. And the Persien seid that it profiteth moche to take 
fastyng, of the greynes of myle. I for sothe sey that who slepeth 
so moch that he fyndeth no ponderosite in his body, and specially 
|P_62 
wombe, he nedeth not to be a-ferd. And who eteth euery mornyng 
7 dragmes of radissh, bake, wele sweted, he nede not fere no sikenesse 
of flewme neyther govt, his mynde therby wolle be amended, 
his intellect lighted. And who in tyme convenient vseth it accordyng 
to his complexion, he shall be sure and have no cause to drede 
feuere quartayn. And who vseth to ete nvttes with fyges and with 
a fewe braunches of rewe, venyme that day shall not anoye hym, 
O high Kyng, studye in all wise to kepe and hold thy naturell hete. 
For as longe as temperat hete is in the man, and moisture naturell, 
the hete is tempered and strengthed, for helthe restoreth in tham 
twayn. And vndrestande wele in this place that destruccion and 
corrupcion of the body cometh of 2 causes, that one is naturell, 
that other innaturell. Naturell cometh of repugnancie and contradiccion 
of 4 contrarie qualitees, as thus drynesse lordshippeth the 
body. Corruption for-sothe [\f. 21v\] cometh a-yenst kynde, of some actuell 
or accidentall cause, as of bataill, or spornyng with a stone, other 
of other chaunces, by siknesse oþer ill counseill. 
 
[}Of knowyng of metes}] 
Of metes some ben sotell, some grosse, and some meen. Sotell 
engendreth clere blode and good, and they ben white, chekons of 
hennes wele norisshed and fatte, and egges. For-sothe, grosse 
metes ben good to hote men, and labourers, and for diners to them 
that slepen after noone. Meene metes engendren none inflammacion, 
neither superfluyte, as lambe, kyd, wether castrot, and all 
flessh that ben hote and moist. Nathelesse it semeth that moisture 
faileth in these fleshis whan they ben rosted and wexen hard, and 
so hote and drye. Therfor yf any such flessh be rosted, ete it hote 
and sone, and specially whan any spices is rosted with them, for 
than it is best. Metes that engendren malencoly ben bugles, befes, 
kyne, and suche other grosse flessh. Nathelesse bestes of that nature, 
wele fed and yonge, brought forth in watery and moist shadowed 
pasture, ben best, swettest, and holsomest. The same may me sey 
of fisshes. And vndrestand wele that fisshes of smale substaunce, 
of sotell skynne, and light to be chaved, the which ben brought 
forth in salt water rynnyng, ben lightest and best. Nathelesse the 
|P_63 
fisshes that ben engendred in the see and brought out of it, ben 
holsomest. Me most beware of tho fisshes that ben of grete substance, 
and of hard skynne, for such fisshes comonly ben venemous. 
And at this tyme of fisshes this is sufficiant, for in the boke 
that Y made the of potages and medecynes, thow shalt fynd this 
mater sufficiantly determyned. 
 
[}Of blode-lettyng by fleobotomye, and of houres therto 
competent}] 
Yf thow wolt lette blode, se that the moone be assendyng and past 
the coniunccion and the sones orbe, and se that she be not in the 
Crabbe, Fisshes, neither Yonglynes. And more be ware þat the 
moone applie to the sone of none aspect, and specially 4le or 
opposicion. And be ware that the mone make no coniunccion bad 
in watry signes, and se that Mercury be not in thascendent, 
neyther in the 7 hous. The same sey Y of Saturne. And vndrestond 
that the last half of the mones mo[{n{]the is better to lette blode in 
than is the first. And [\f. 22r\] lette the moone be in Libra or Scorpion, 
with-out aspect or raies of the noyous planetes, other of bad 
sterres fix, for and she be in the second half reproued or infortuned, 
than is she werst of all. But in kuttyng or garsyng of the 
flessh, lette the mone be accresyng to his light without loke of ony 
noyous sterre, and not opposid to Mercury, but joyned with Venus, 
other biholdyng Venus and Mercury of frendlinesse. Whan the 
moone happeth in thascendent, than hath she domynacion there, 
and so she hath in euery of the 12 houses, aduerbialy, now good, 
now bad, now strong, now feble. But euer be ware of hir in thascendent. 
 
[}Of takyng of medycynes, and houres therto competent}] 
Whan thow wolt take ony medecyne laxatif, sette the mone in the 
Scorpion, Libra, other in Pisces. But be ware that she neygh not to 
Saturne, for than congeleth she the humours and the medecyne 
in the body. And the ferther she be fro Saturne, the better it is. 
But drede not her beyng with Mercury. Therfor thynk that þe 
begynnyng of thi werk, and the surenesse of thy body, after the 
|P_64 
good constellacion of the moone, and her absence fro noyous 
sterres and after her prosperite in her ascense. 
 
[}Of yevyng of medecynes and of houres therto appropred}] 
Ar thow yeve medecyne, se in what signe the sone is. And yf it be 
in a colerik signe, me most make sharper the medcyne. And yf in 
a melancolik signe, moche more. And yf in a flevmatik signe, moch 
lasse. After the qualite and reson of the signe whan it is hurt and 
constreyned, the nature of the wombe is to be lax. More-ouer, 
thow most se in like wise yf the mone be in a colerik, flevmatik, 
other malancolik signe. And yf the bothe luminaries be-hold and 
resceyve other in colerik signes, the medecyne than yeve shall 
some men litell anoye, and yf they in malencolik signes do so, 
moche lasse, for it is but seld vsed. But yf they bothe be in flevmatik 
signes, the medecyne take lightly worcheth, and specialy 
yf the moone be accresyng. 
 
[}The [{6{] booke, of the nature of certayn herbes and stones, 
and of Aristotles secretes.}] 
[\f. 22v\] [{O{]f the qualite, proprete and vertue of some herbes, and of thair 
profites by short trete in this chapiter &c, I wolle determyne, but 
in oure other booke fully of thaire proprete and of the strengthes 
of herbes, and natures of plantis, we have declared. And therfor 
what we sey now of plantes and stones, as touchyng þis werk it is 
now. But now, Alexandre, thow shalt wele vndrestand that as in 
plantes ben dyvers natures and strengthes, so in stones beth many 
kyndes and vertues. The price of thair fairenesse and the profites 
ben inestimable, and specially they be convenient to the mageste 
roiall of a prince, for they maken faire the diademes of kynges, þei 
comforten the sight of the eyen, they plesen the soule. It arraieth 
the dignite. And [{by{] thair vertues full gracious, siknesse ben expelled 
fro men-is bodies, and with-out them litell worth is medecyne, 
and specialy where me wold have grevous siknesse put a-way. 
Full grete and mervelous vertue is bothe in plantes and in stones, 
|P_65 
but fro mankynd they ben hid. But we in oure boke of stones and 
plantes have þeir propretees and vertues more fully exponed. In 
primis, therfor, O Alexandre, I wolle yeve the amonge the 
secretes the grettest þat þurgh Goddes myght shall helpe the 
to bryng about thy purpose, and to kepe secre the privete. Therfor 
take the stone animal, vegetable, and mynerall, the which is no 
stone, neither hath the nature of a stone. And this stone is like 
in maner to stones of montaynes, of mynes, and of plantes animal, 
and it is founde in euery place, in euery tyme, in euery man, and 
it is conuertible to all colours, and ther-in ben contened all 
elementes, and it is cleped the litell world. And Y wolle name hym 
by his propre name, as þe comone peple calleth it, that is to sey, 
the terme of an egge, that is to sey, the philosophers egge. Dyvyde 
hym therfor in 4 parties, for euery part hath o nature, and than 
compone hym egally and proporcionly, so that ther be no dyvysion 
ther-in neyther repugnance, and thow shalt have thy purpose, 
God grauntyng it the. This maner is profitable, but Y wolle 
dyvyde hym [\f. 23r\] to the in speciall operacions. Dyvyde it in 4, and 2 
maners may be do wele, and with-out corrupcion. Therfor, whan 
thow hast water of the aier, and aier of fire, and fire of erthe, than 
shalt thou have fully this craft. Dispose therfor thy aiery substaunce 
by discrecion, and dispose the substance, by cause, by 
moisture, and hete, till þei accorde and joyne, and discorde nether 
deceuere not. And than joyne to them 2 vertues operatifes, water 
and fire, and than is thy werk accomplisshed. For and thow medled 
it with water soole, it will make it white, and yf thow medle it 
with fire, it wolle be rede, God grauntyng. Oure fader Hermogenes, 
that is cleped treble in philosophie, he spoke best ther-in, seiyng: 
Trouth hath hym so, and it is no doute, that the lover to the heigher, 
and the heigher to the lower aunsweren. The worcher forsoth of 
all myracles is the one and sool God, of and fro Whom cometh 
all meruelous operacions. So all thynges were created of o soole 
substance and of o soole disposicion, the fader wherof is the 
sone, and the moone moder, that brought hym forth by blast or 
aier in the wombe, the erthe taken fro it, to whom is seid the increat 
fader, tresour of myracles, and yever of vertues. Of fire is made 
erthe. Depart the erthe fro the fire, for the sotiller is worthier than 
the more grosse, and the thynne thyng than the thik. This most 
be do wisely and discretly. It ascendith fro the erth into þe heven, 
|P_66 
and falleth fro heven to the erthe, and therof sleith the higher and 
the lower vertue. And [{þus{] it lordship[{pes{] in þe lower and in the 
heigher, and thow shalt lordship aboue and beneth, which forsoth 
is the light of lightes, and therfor fro the wolle fle all derknesse. 
The higher vertue ouer-cometh all, for sothe all thynne thyng doth 
in dense thynges. After the disposicion of the more world rynneth 
this worchyng. And for this prophetisyng of the trynyte of God 
Hermogenes i[{s{] called Triplex, trebill in philosophie, as Aristotle 
seith. Of the mervailes of this world is that stone, that fighteth 
with waters and wyndes. Thow shalt se [\f. 23v\] hym rise vp on the water, 
whan the waters rynnen with wyndes. And it is born in the 
Mediterrayn See. His proprete is this: yf thow take this stone and 
put hym in a-nother stone, and bere hym with the, this is impossible: 
that any host shall endure ayenst the, other resist ayenst the, 
but fle hedyngly before the. Ther ben 2 stones of mervelous vertue, 
that ben found in derk places, of the which one is white, that other 
is rede, and ben found in spotillissh waters. Thair operacions ben 
these: the white begynneth to appere vpone the water in the fallyng 
of the sone, and abideth vpon the water till mydnyght, and than 
begynneth to discende downward, and at the sone rysyng she is 
at the bothome. The rede stone worcheth contrarye, for whan the 
sone ariseth she begynneth to appere, and so to mydday, and than 
begynneth to descende tille the sone-fallyng. The propretees of tho 
2 stones also ben these: yf thou woldest honge of the rede stone 
a weight of a car[{a{]t vpon one of the hors of thyne host, the hors of 
thyn host shall not cesse neying tille þu put the stone a-way. The 
operacion of the white stone is the contrarie, for the horse that bere 
it shall never nye tille thow remove it a-way. Therfor they be good 
to stere thretyng, and to werkes of hostes. The propretees of tho 
stones also ben these: yf two stryve to-gedre, put the white stone 
in one of thair mouthes, and yf he be in the right he shall anon 
speke, and yf he be not, he shall wex dombe as long as it is in his 
mouth. The rede stone worcheth to the contrarye. And Y wille 
determyne to the the propretees and vertues of stones in enchauntementis, 
and of some [{plantes{], in the next tretys. Thow hast fully 
of the precedentes knowen, whan Y treted to the [{of{] nature[{s{] and 
secretis of kynde, of thair degrees, of disposicion of plantes, and of 
disposicion of mynerall after the essense and beyng therof, and 
|P_67 
whan it resceyveth his propre fourme after his nature and begynnyng, 
fro the natures above, that is myghtyest and lordshippyng 
there-in. And in plantis water is myghtyest in nature, and in 
mynerall the erthe, and in [\f. 24r\] stones. Plantes resceyveth their nature 
of water by extension, as water resceyveth it by movyng and impulsion 
of wyndes in his place. And as water is of dyuers figures, 
so dyuers figures ben in plantes, for all figures ben ther-in. And 
sithen water is most myghtyest in plantes, and it sheweth not but 
by diffusion, and Mercury is worker of dissolucion of waters, and 
in his heven vncessably worcheth it, than he must gouerne it as 
euery planet gouerneth that thyng þat is accordyng and conuenient 
to his nature. Example of grace: Saturne gouerneth the erth, 
Mercury the water, Jupiter the aier, the sone the fire. These 
inconvenientes be not found in the planetes but in the operacions 
that they have, contynuell and perpetuell, by the vniuersell vertue 
aboue, that is above all the vertues of these operacions, but here is 
no place to sheve the highnesse therof. Natheles here Y make 
mension, for it is full necessary and profitable for the tretis suyng, 
in the which we shall declare of other thynges, and of indyvyduis of 
certeyn vegetable plantis. Therfor the knowlechyng of the propretees 
of these thynges bilongeth to philosophers. Forsoth the 
operacion of naturell thynges pertenyth leeches. And Y wolle 
that thy prudence be not hid, that all thyng lakkyng light of þe 
nombre vegetable is gouerned of Satourne and yeve to hym, and 
all thynge that flovreth and is lumynous is yoven to be gouerned 
of Mercury, and all thyng vegetable that floureth and bereth no 
frute is yove to Mars and by hym gouerned. After-ward compone 
and joyne these dyvysions, and sey all vegetable beryng forth frut 
[{not florisshyng{], as palme, is yove to Saturne, and to the sone, 
and all florisshyng not beryng fruyt, is ruled by Mercury and Mars. 
Also some vegetables ben by bowes, some by seedes, and some 
ben with-out seedes or plantacion. Therfor is shewed openly that 
euery spice of vegitable hath his propre disposicion, that is complexioned, 
and foloweth the vertue, of one of the planetis, other of 
more, after he hath take it, and helpeth euery proprete the vertue 
of the planet þat he is propred to [\f. 24v\] by vertue naturall that disposeth 
|P_68 
his spices vnto hete, sauour, odour and figure. And the naturell 
soule gedreth all the propretees and vertues naturell, for they 
rynnen therfro and foloweth it, and yeveth enduryng to them, 
for as long tyme as their nature have signified and diffined. For 
there is none act with-out movyng, and no operacion with-out 
terme. And so shalt thow fynde some spices anoying, and some 
helpyng, and some engendren gladnesse, and some love, some 
hate. Some geven reuerence and honour to the berer, some abieccion 
and contempt. Some causeth fals dremes, some trew visions. 
Some gendreth man-hode and strength, some sleuth and feblenesse. 
Some heleth the bodies and kepeth þem fro venyme 
mortell, some corrupteth the body, and inducith in tham deth. 
And I shall make to the mencion of all these spices, with open 
argumentis and probacions therof. Sothly that spice of vegetable 
that engendreth reuerence and honour, it is a tre havyng leves 
wrapped to-gedre. The fourme of the leves and fruyt is rounde, 
the tre of hym-self is moist and most swete of odour. Who-so-euer 
taketh of that tree in his name and bereth it with hym, the vertue 
of hym yeveth hym reuerence and honour. And ther is a-nother tre 
that ryseth as longe as a mannes arme, havyng longe leves and 
moist, havyng ther-in white leves. Who-so-euer bereth a substance 
therof, he shall be honoured and exalted. And ther is a-nother tre 
that hath full grete leves, and his palmites ben streight vpon the 
erth, and the odour is good. And who-so-euer bereth therof he 
shall be glad, light, worthy and myghty. With hym it is not good 
for to stryve or fight, for his aduersary shall be slayn, and in his 
operacion [{he{] shall have victorie. And of spices of trees is a certayn 
spice that hath cropp, and is planted, havyng oblong leves, 
and the leves falleth fro the tree as she bere fruyt, and she hath 
3 rede oblong floures of swete savour and odour. Who eteth tho 
floures, he shall have joye and laughter, and who plukketh it vp 
with leves and crop, and shaketh a-way the flour thynkyng of any 
femynyn persone, that wolle stere her to kendle [\f. 25r\] in his love. Ther 
is a-noþer tre cleped androsmon, and it groweth in þe land of Zyn, 
and it is pleted to-gedre, havyng dry leves, and full lytell and 
passyng smal sedes rounde, and withyn white. Yf þu take 7 cornes 
of þat sede in the name of ony persone and bray þem in his name, 
Venus arisyng, so that her ray[{i{]es touche them, yeve it hym to 
drynk or ete, and þi drede shall abide stille in his hert, and euer 
|P_69 
he shall obeye the, duryng all þi lyf. And of spices and plantes 
ther is oone þat gendreth langour, whos crop is planted, whos 
bowes strecchen out as long as a man-is arme. Þe floures ben white, 
havyng leves and beryng no fruyt. Of þe proprete it is of Mars and 
of Mercury, the nature of it of fire and of thaier. Þe berer þerof 
shall never be with ou[{t{] langour while it is on hym. And þer 
is anoþer of the kynde of plantes, and it is sanatif, the sede þerof 
sowe, the rotes square, the leves rounde, the floures of celestyn 
colour. And the sede ben rede, and the odour swete and of good 
tast. Who drynkeþ therof or smelleth, þe odour of it heleth hym 
of þe pose, oþer of melancoly of thoughty mynde, of swellyng of 
feere, of frenesy, and of many other siknesse. There is a-nother 
plant cleped farrolidon and gendreth [{hate and contempt{]. 
 
Ther is anoþer plant cleped matynison and it is worthy to gete 
love and reuerence therby. O Alexandre, I have fulfilled that I 
promysed to the to trete vpon, and openly I have soiled it. Therfor 
alwayes be manly and vertuous, and þe glorious God gouerne, 
dresse and kepe the, Whos goodnesse euery creature perceyveth.
