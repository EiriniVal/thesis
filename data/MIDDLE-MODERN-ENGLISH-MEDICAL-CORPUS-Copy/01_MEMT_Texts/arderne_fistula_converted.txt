[\f. 141v\] [}Of the ploge of fistula in ano, and of þe 
manere of þe leche, and of instrumentis 
necessary for þe fistule.}] 
 
[{I, I{]ohn Arderne fro the first pestilence that was 
in the 3ere of oure lord 1349 duellid in Newerk in 
Notyngham-shire vnto the 3ere of oure lord 1370, and 
ther I helid many men of fistula in ano. Of whiche the 
first was Sire Adam Eueryngham of laxton-in-the-clay 
byside Tukkesford; whiche Sire Adam, forsoth, was in 
Gascone with sir Henry, that tyme named Erle of 
derby and aftir was made duke of lancastre, a noble and 
worthi lord. The forsaid sir Adam, forsoth, suffrand 
fistulam in ano, made for to aske counsel at all the leche3 
and cirurgien3 that he my3t fynde in Gascone, at Burdeux, 
at Briggerac, Tolows, and Neyrbon, and Peyters, 
and many other places. And all forsoke hym for vncurable; 
whiche y-se and y-herde, þe forseid Adam hastied 
for to torne hom to his contre. And when he come 
home, he did of al his kny3tly clothinges and cladde 
mornyng clothes, in purpose of abydyng dissoluyng, or 
lesyng, of his body beyng ni3 to hym. At last I, forseid 
Iohn Arderne, y-sou3t and couenant y-made, come to hym 
and did my cure to hym and, oure lord beyng mene, I 
helid hym perfitely within half a 3ere; and aftirward, 
hole and sounde, he ledde a glad lif by 30 3ere and more, 
ffor whiche cure I gatte myche honour and louyng þur3 
al ynglond. And the forseid duke of lancastre and many 
othir gentile3 wondred ther-of. Aftirward I cured hugon 
derlyng of ffowick of Balne by Snayþe. Aftirward I 
|P_2 
cured Iohn Schefeld of Bri3twell a-side Tekyll. Aftirward 
I cured sir Reynald Grey, lord of Wilton in Wale3 
and lord of Schirlond biside Chesterfelde, whiche asked 
counsel at the most famose leches of yngland, and none 
availed hym. Aftirward I cured sir Henry Blakborne, 
clerk, Tresorer of the lord Prince of Wale3. Aftirward I 
cured Adam Oumfray of Shelforde byside Notyngham, 
and sir Iohn, preste of the same toune; and Iohn of 
holle of Shirlande; and Sir Thomas hamelden, parsone 
of langare in the Vale of Beuare. Aftirward I curid frere 
Thomas Gunny, custode of the frere Mynours of 3orke. 
Aftirward, in the 3ere of oure lord 1370, I come to 
london, and ther I cured Iohn Colyn, Mair of Northampton, 
that asked counsel at many leche3. Aftirward 
I helid or cured Hew Denny, ffisshmanger of london, 
in Briggestrete; and William Polle, and Raufe Double; 
and oon that was called Thomas Broune, that had 15 
holes by whiche went out wynde with egestious odour; 
that is to sey, 8 hole3 of the to[{ne{] party of the ersse, 
and 7 on the tothir side; Of whiche some hole3 was 
distant fro the towell by the space of the handbrede of a 
man, so that bothe his buttokis was so vlcerat and 
putrefied with-in that the quitour and filthe went out ich 
day als mych as an egg-shel mi3t take. Afterward [\f. 142r\] I 
cured 4 frere3 prechours, that is to sey ffrere Iohn Writell, 
ffrere Iohn haket, ffrere Petre Browne, ffrere Thomas 
Apperley, and a 3ong man called Thomas Voke. Of 
whiche forseid som had only on hol y-distaunte fro the 
towel by oon ynche, or by two, or by thre. And other[{s{] 
had 4 or 5 hole3 procedyng to the codde of the testicle3; 
And many other maners of whiche the tellyng war ful 
hard. All thise forseid cured I afore the makyng of this 
boke. Oure lord Ihesu y-blessid God knoweth that I lye 
not, and therfore no man dout of this, þof-al old famous 
men and ful clere in studie haue confessed tham that 
thei fande nat the wey of curacion in this case. ffor god, 
that is deler or rewarder of wisdom, hath hid many thingis 
fro wise men and sli3e whiche he vouchesaf aftirward for 
to shewe to symple men. Therfore al men þat ar to 
come aftirward witte thai that old maistre3 war no3t 
|P_3 
bisie ne pertinace3 in sekyng and serchyng of this forseid 
cure. But for thai mi3t no3t take the hardnes of it at the 
first frount, thei kest it vtterly byhinde þair bak. Of 
whiche, forsoþ, som demed it holy for to be incurable; 
oþer applied doutful opinions. Therfore for-als-miche 
in hard thingis it spedith to studiers for to perseuere and 
abide, and for to turne subtily thair wittes. ffor it is opned 
not to þam that ar passand but to tham þat ar perseuerand. 
Therfore to the honour of god almy3ti that hath 
opned witte to me that I shuld fynde tresour hidde in the 
felde of studiers that long tyme and [{with{] pantyng breest 
I haue swette and trauailed ful bisily and pertinacely in 
diuanudiis. As my faculte sufficeþ without fair spekyng 
of endityng, I haue brou3t for to shew it openly to tham 
that cometh aftur, our lord beyng me[{ne{] and this boke. 
No3t that I shewe myself more worthi of louyng of suche 
a gifte than other, but that I greue not god, and for the 
dragme that he hath giffen to me that I be not constreyned 
for treson. Therfore I pray that the grace of the holy 
gost be to this werke, that he vouch-saf for to spede it; 
that tho thingis whiche in wrokyng trewly I am ofte 
tymes experte, I may plenerly explane tham in this litel 
boke. And this I sey that I know no3t in al my tyme, 
ne hard not in al my tyme, of any man, nouþer in 
yngland ne in partie3 bi3ond þe see, that kouthe cure 
fistula in ano; outake a frere minour that was with the 
prince of Wale3 in gascon & gyan, whiche rosed & bosted 
hym that he had cured the forseid sekenes. And at 
london he deceyued many men; and when he mi3t no3t 
cure som man, he made suggestion to tham that no man 
mi3t cure tham, and that affermed he with sweryng that 
3if the fistule war dried, that the pacient at the next shuld 
no3t eschape dethe; whiche, forsoþe, y-lefte & forsake of 
hym I cured perfitely. And to remoue false opinions of 
ignorant men, for witnes I putte experience. Auicen, 
forsoþ, seiþ, 'experience ouercomeþ reson'; and galien 
in pantegni seiþ, 'No man [\f. 142v\] ow for to trust in reson 
al-oon but 3it it be proued of experience.' And he seith 
in anoþer place, 'Experience without reson is feble, & 
so is reson withoute experience fest vnto hym.' Neþerlesse 
|P_4 
I afferme no3t that I mi3t hele al ffistulae in ano. ffor 
som ben vncurable as it shal be seid [{more fully{] within 
when I shal trete of tham. ffirst it bihoueth hym that 
wil profite in this crafte that he sette god afore euermore in 
all his werkis, and euermore calle mekely with hert and 
mouth his help; and som tyme visite of his wynnyngis 
poure men aftir his my3t, that thai by thair prayers may 
gete hym grace of the holy goste. And that he be no3t 
y-founden temerarie or bosteful in his seyingis or in his 
dedes; and abstene he hym fro moche speche, and most 
among grete men; and answere he slei3ly to thingis 
y-asked, that he be no3t y-take in his wordes. fforsoth 
3if his werkes be oft tyme knowen for to discorde fro his 
wordes and his byhestis, he shal be halden more vnworthi, 
and he shal blemmyssh his oone gode fame. Wherfore 
seiþ a versifiour; 'vincat opus verbum, minuit iactantia 
famam'; 'lat werke ouercome thi worde, for boste 
lesseneþ gode lose.' Also be a leche no3t mich laughyng 
ne mich playing. And als moche as he may withoute 
harme fle he þe felawshippe of knafes and of vnu[{n{]este 
persones. And be he euermore occupied in thingis that 
biholdith to his crafte; outhir rede he, or studie he, or 
write or pray he; for the excercyse of bokes worshippeþ 
a leche. ffor why; he shal boþ byholden and he shal 
be more wise. And aboue al þise it profiteth to hym 
that he be founden euermore sobre; ffor dronkenne3 
destroyeth al vertu and bringith it to not, as seith a wise 
man, 'Ebrietas frangit quicquid sapiencia tangit': 'Dronkenes 
breketh what-so wisdom toucheth.' Be he content 
in strange places of metes and drinkes þer y-founden, 
vsyng mesure in al thingis. ffor the wise man seith, 
'Sicut ad omne quod est mensuram ponere prodest, Sic 
sine mensura deperit omne quod est': 'As it profiteth to 
putte mesure to al thing that is, So without mesure 
perissheþ all þing þat is.' Skorne he no man. ffor of 
that it is seid, 'Deridens alios non inderisus abibit': 'He 
that skorneþ other men shal not go away vnskorned.' 
3if ther be made speche to hym of any leche, nouther 
sette he hym at nou3t ne preise hym to mich or commende 
hym, but thus may he curteysly answere; 'I haue 
|P_5 
no3t vrey knowleche of hym, but I lerned no3t ne I haue 
not herd of hym but gode and honeste.' And of this shal 
honour and thankyngis of eche party encresse and multiplie 
to hym; aftur this, honour is in the honorant & no3t 
in the honored. Considere he no3t ouer openly the lady 
or the dou3ters or oþer fair wymmen in gret mennes 
[{houses{] ne profre tham no3t to kisse, ne touche not 
priuely ne apertely thair pappes, ne thair handes, ne 
thair share, that he renne no3t into the indignacion of the 
lord ne of noon of his. In as moche as he may, greue he 
no seruant, but [\f. 143r\] gete he thair loue and thair gode wille. 
Abstene he hym fro harlotrie als wele in wordes as in 
dedes in euery place, for 3if he vse hym to harlotery in 
priue places som tyme in opene place ther may falle to 
hym vnworship of yuel vsage; aftir þat it is seyde, 
'Pede super colles pedes vbi pedere nolles.' 'ffart vpon 
hille3 and thou shalt fart whar thou wolde no3t agayn thi 
wille3.' And it is seid in anoþer place, 'Shrewed speche 
corrumpith gode maners.' When seke men, forsoth, or 
any of tham bysyde comeþ to the leche to aske help or 
counsel of hym, be he no3t to tham ouer felle ne ouer 
homely, but mene in beryng aftir the askyngis of the 
persone3; to som reuerently, to som comonly. ffor after 
wise men, Ouer moche homelynes bredeþ dispisyng. 
Also it spedeþ þat he haue semyng excusacions that he 
may not incline to þair askyngis, without harmyng or 
without indignacion of som gret man or frende, or for 
necessarie occupacion. Or feyne he hym hurt, or for to be 
seke, or som other couenable cause by whiche he may 
likely be excused. Therfor, 3if he will fauoure to any 
mannes askyng, make he couenant for his trauaile, and 
take it byforehande3. But avise þe leche hym-self wele 
that he giffe no certayn answer in any cause, but he se 
first þe sikenes and the maner of it; and whan he haþ 
seen and assaied it, þof-al hym seme that the seke may 
be heled, neþerlesse he shal make pronosticacion to þe 
pacient þe perile3 to come 3if the cure be differred. And 
3if he se þe pacient persewe bisily the cure, þan after 
that þe state of þe pacient askeþ aske he boldly more 
or lesse; but euer be he warre of scarse askyngis, ffor 
|P_6 
ouer scarse askyngis setteþ at not both þe markette 
and the thing. Therfore for the cure of fistula in 
ano, when it is curable, aske he competently, of a 
worthi man and a gret an hundred marke or fourty 
pounde, wiþ robe3 and fee3 of an hundred shillyng 
terme of lyfe by 3ere. Of lesse men fourty pounde, or 
fourty marke aske he without fee3; And take he no3t 
lesse þan an hundred shillyngis. ffor neuer in all my lyf 
toke I lesse than an hundred shillyng for cure of that 
sekenes. Neþerlesse do another man as hym þink better 
and more spedefulle. And 3if the pacientes or thair 
frende3 or seruaunt3 aske by how moche tyme he hopeth 
to hele it, euermore lat the leche byhete þe double þat 
he supposeth to spede by half; that is 3if the leche hope 
to hele þe pacient by twenty wekes – that is the comon 
course of curyng - adde he so many ouer. ffor it is better 
that the terme be lengthed þan the cure. ffor prolongacion 
of the cure giffeþ cause of dispairyng to the paciente3 
when triste to the leche is moste hope of helthe. And 
3if the pacient considere or wondre or aske why that he 
putte hym so long a tyme of curyng, siþe þat he heled 
hym by the half, answere he that it was for that the 
pacient was strong-herted, and suffrid wele sharp þingis, 
and that he was of gode complexion and hadde able flesshe 
to hele; & feyne he othir causes pleseable to the pacient, 
ffor paciente3 of syche worde3 are proude and delited. Also 
dispose a leche [\f. 143v\] hym that in clothes and othir apparalyngis 
be he honeste, no3t likkenyng hymself in apparalyng or 
berying to mynistralle3, but in clothing and beryng shew 
he the maner of clerkes. ffor why; it semeth any discrete 
man y-cladde with clerkis clothing for to occupie 
gentil menne3 borde3. Haue the leche also clene handes 
and wele shapen naile3 & clensed fro all blaknes and filthe. 
And be he curtaise at lorde3 borde3, and displese he no3t 
in wordes or dedes to the gestes syttyng by; here he many 
þingis but speke he but fewe. For a wise man seith, 
'It semeth more to vse the eres than þe tunge'; And in 
an-oþer place, '3if thou had bene stille thou had bene 
holden a philosophre.' And whan he shal speke, be the 
worde3 short, and, als mich as he may, faire and resonable 
|P_7 
and withoute sweryng. Be war that ther be neuer 
founden double worde in his mouthe, ffor 3if he be 
founden trew in his wordes ffewe or noon shal doute in 
his dede3. Lere also a 3ong leche gode prouerbe3 pertenyng 
to his crafte in counfortyng of paciente3. Or 
3if pacientes pleyne that ther medicynes bene bitter or 
sharp or sich other, than shal the leche sey to the pacient 
thus; "It is redde in the last lesson of matyns of the 
natiuite of oure lord that oure lorde Ihesus criste come 
into this world for the helthe of mannes kynd to the 
maner of a gode leche and wise. And when he cometh 
to the seke man he sheweth hym medicynes, som li3t 
and som hard; and he seiþ to the seke man, '3if þou 
wilt be made hole þise and þise shal thou tak.' Also 
in another place in an omely vpon the gospel of the sone3 
of Zebedee, wher þer moder askid seying, 'lord, sey þat 
my two sones sitte in thy kyngdome, þe tone on þi ri3t 
hand and the toþer on the left.' And Ihesus answeryng 
seide, '3e wote neuer what 3e aske'; þan seid he to the 
sone3 of Zebedee, 'May 3e drink þe chalice þat I am to 
drink?' Þai seid to him, 'We may'; as 3if he seid to 
þam, '3if 3oure soule or mynd couaite þat deliteþ, 
drinke þe first þat soroweþ or akeþ.' And so by bitter 
drinkis of confeccion it is come to the ioyes of helþe." 
Ouer that hym ow to comforte þe pacient in monysshyng 
hym that in anguisshe3 he be of gret hert. ffor gret hert 
makeþ a man hardy and strong to suffre sharp þingis 
and greuous: And it is a gret vertue and an happy, ffor 
Boecius seiþ, De disciplina scolarium, 'He is no3t worþi of 
þe poynt of swetnes that kan no3t be lymed with greuyng 
of bitternes. ffor why; a strong medicyne answerith 
to a strong sekenes.' And þeron seiþ a wise man, 'Be 
no cure sene heuy or greuous to the to whiche foloweþ 
ane heleful effecte.' And in anoþer place it is seid, 
'happy or blessid he þat day þat ordeyneþ mery 3eres.' 
And anoþer seith, 'he may neuer be in reste of body þat 
is oute of reste of soule; I wil suffre lesse þingis þat I 
suffre no3t more greuous.' It semeþ a gret herted man 
for to suffre sharp þingis; he, forsoþ, þat is wayke of 
hert is no3t in way of curacion, ffor [\f. 144r\] why; for soþe in al 
|P_8 
my lyf I haue sene but fewe laborante in þis vice heled 
in any sikenes: þerfore it is to be-war to wise men þat 
þei entremette no3t with sich. ffor whi; Þe wise man 
seiþ, 'All þinges ar hard to a waik hert man, for þai 
trow euermore yuelle3 to be ny3e to þam; þei drede 
euermore, þai suffre no þingis, þai are euermore vnstable 
and vnwise; þerfore a versifiour seiþ of tham, 'Quominus 
nil pacior paciendi me tenet horror': þat is þof-al I 
suffre no-þing, vgglynes of suffryng holdeth me. Also 
it spedeth þat a leche kunne talke of gode tale3 and of 
honest that may make þe pacientes to laugh, as wele of the 
biblee as of other tragedie3; & any othir þingis of which it 
is no3t to charge while3 þat þey make or induce a li3t hert 
to þe pacient or þe sike man. Discouer neuer the leche 
vnwarly the counselle3 of his paciente3, als wele of men as 
of wymmen, ne sette no3t oon to anoþer at no3t, þof-al 
he haue cause, þat he be no3t gilty of counsell; ffor 3if a 
man se þe hele wele anoþer mannes counsel he wil trist 
better in þe. Many þinges, forsoþe, bene to be kepte 
of a leche, wiþoute þese þat ar seid afore, þat may no3t 
be noted here for ouer moche occupying. But it is no3t 
to dout þat if þe forseid be wele kepte þat-ne þai shal 
giffe a gracious going to þe vser to þe hi3te of worship 
and of wynnyng; for Caton seiþ, 'Virtutem primam puta 
esse compescere linguam': The first vertu trow you to be 
to refreyne þe tong. Aftur al þise it houeth that he 
knowe þe names of þe instrumentis þat perteneth to þe 
cure of þe fistule, withoute whiche a leche may no3t wele 
spede hym. Of whiche þe first is called 'Sequere me' 
- 'follow me' - whose shap is shewed wher þe instrumente3 
ar paynted. [^FIGURE OMITTED^] And it is called 'Sequere me' for it 
is þe first instrument pertenyng to þat werk; for a lech 
ow for to serche þer-with þe way of þe fistule whider it 
goþ, wheþer by þe midde3 of longaon or no3t. And it 
ow to be made on þe same maner as wymmen vseþ in 
þair heuede3, and of þe same metal; and it ow to be 
smal þat it may li3tly be plied & replied. And be þe 
heuede3 als little as þai may wele be, elle3 þai mi3t no3t 
wele entere þe mouþ of þe fistule for þe streitnes of it. 
|P_9 
ffor why; oft tyme3 ffistule in ano hath ri3t smale hole3, 
so þat som tyme þai shew no3t but þat þer appereth 
bolnyng in þe mouþes of þam. Afterward is þer 
anoþer instrument, þat is called 'Acus rostrata,' a 
snowted nedle, for it hath þe tone heued like a snowte, 
and in þe toþer an y3e like a nedel by whiche þredes 
ow to be drawen agayn by midde3 of þe fistule, as it shal 
be seid within in his place. And it ow to be of siluer, as 
it is paynted; and it ow to be no gretter ne lenger in þe 
snowte þan as it is paynted, but it ow to be longer atte 
þe left, þat it contene in al 8 ynches in lenghþe. Þe 
þrid instrument is called 'tendiculum,' and it ow to be 
made of boxe or of anoþir competent tree, nouþer 
lenger ne gretter þan his shap is paynted. And it 
ow to haue an hole þurgh in þe side, as it is peynted, 
In whiche hole be þer putte [\f. 144v\] in a wrayst, by midde3 
of whiche wraiste in þe ouer ende shal be a litel hole 
þurgh whiche shal be putte þe two ende3 of grete þrede 
four folde, goyng atte firste by þe towel and þe hole of 
þe fistule; whiche þrede is called ffrenum cesaris, and 
the whiche also goyng atuyx þe wraiste, in wraistyng þe 
skynne atuyx þe tewel & þe fistule be faste constreyned 
aboue þe snowte of þe nedel, vnto þat kittyng be done. 
'Siringa' is an holow instrument by þe midde3, and it 
ow to be made of the shappe as it is peynted here, 
nouþer gretter ne lenger, but euen after þe shappe as it 
is peynted here; ne haue it no3t but oon hole in þe neþer 
ende or smaller ende, as it is peynted here. 

|P_11 
[\f. 145r\] [}Of þe aposteme3 in þe lure causyng þe fistule, 
and þe cure of tham.}] 
2. [{T{]hof-al þe principal entent was for to trete de 
fistula in ano, Neþerles it spedeþ first for to touche somwhat 
of aposteme bredyng þer-in or ni3e, siþe oft tyme 
aposteme3 bredyng þer bene cause of fistule or of cancre. 
ffor, after auctours, Aposteme y-bred in any place of þe 
body, if it be not y-helid by þre or four moneþes, it is 
turned into a fistule or a cancre. Therfore when ther 
falleth ane aposteme in þe lure or ni3e þou shalt knowe 
it by þese signes; þat is by bolnyng, akyng, brynnyng, 
3ekyng & prikkyng. And the pacient for akyng and 
anguissh may nouþer sitte ne ligge ne slepe. Whiche 
apperyng, ffirst it is to labour to þe slakyng or esyng of 
the akyng and brennyng and of oþer accidente3 without 
repercussione. ffor in þe lure ow no3t to be repercussion, 
siþe it is ane emunctory, and in emunctorie3 ow it no3t to 
be done; þese bene emunctorie3: - þe armeholes, þe 
þeholes, þe chawelle3, &c. And witte þou after 
Gilbertyne þat ane aposteme beyng within þe lure is 
cured with þe infusion of oile roset in which is ceruse 
distempred, or led brent, or litarge, or all þise if þai be 
hadde, or with þe 3olk of an ey. And he be euermore 
warre of paynyng of egestion. And 3if his wombe be 
costyue be it softned þat þe hardnes of þe ordure bryng 
no3t in anguissh in egestion doyng. And be it softned 
with ane emplastre of malue3 & swynes grese; Or with 
water of decoccioun of malue3 and branne, with oile or 
butter fressh, or suche other, and be it 3ette in by a 
clisterye. Therfore take oyle roset and medle it with þe 
3olke of a rawe ey in euen porcion. Aftir putte it in a 
little bleddere, þan take a Nastar of tree and putte it in 
þe bladder and bynde it aboute wiþ a strong þrede, and 
enoynt þe for ende wele with oyle roset, and softly putte 
it in þe lure and presse þat is in þe bleddre with þi 
fyngres in-to þe lure. Þis, forsoþe, swageþ and 
softeneþ þe brynnyng, þe prikkyng, smertyng & 
akyng, and comforteþ þe membre in boþe cause, þat is 
|P_12 
boþe in hote and colde. ffor, after auctores, Oile roset 
coldeþ ane hote membre and hoteþ ane colde membre; 
and it doþ many oþer profites þere and in al þe 
membres of þe body. And þerfore a gode leche puruey 
hym þat he want neuer oyle roset, siþe þer procedeþ of 
it many helpyngis to mannes body; for why; after Galien 
to euery akyng hote oile roset is mytigatif. Vpon þe 
aposteme, forsoþe, vtward be putte a gode emplastre and 
ri3t maturatif of diaquilon resolute with oile roset, or oile 
of lilie3, or of camamill, or dialtred, or comon oyle, þat is 
oyle of olyue, or swyne grese, or gandres, or maulerdes, 
or hennes grese. ffor whi; diaquilon þus y-ordeyned and 
put-to matureþ colde materie3 & resolueþ & mollifieþ 
hard materies. Also be þer made suche a vntment þat is 
ri3t mitigatiue. Recipe: tame comon malue3 M. i or M. ij, 
& brisse þam in a morter, and put þam in a quart of 
oyle of olyue3 and lat þam putrifie þerin 7 dayes or 9. 
After boile þam long at þe fire vnto þe oile be wele 
grene; after cole it and [\f. 145v\] kepe it: þis oyntment is ry3t 
mitigatiue of akyng of aposteme3, and mollifie3 þan if it 
be put vpon [{tham{] hote with lana succida. Lana succida 
is wolle þat groweth atuix þe legge3 of ane ewe about þe 
vdder, ful of swet, no3t y-wasshe, and it opneþ strongly 
and consumeth; oyle, forsoþe, of propirte holdeþ opne 
and draweth and swageþ akyng. If, forsoþ, þou haue 
no3t lanam succidam þan dippe a lyn clout in þe forseid

þat it fal not away. Also ane emplastre of þe forseid 
malue3 is a ful gode maturatif and mitigatif of akyng in 
aposteme3 of þe lure and of wymmen3 pappe3, and to al 
oþer aposteme3 þat nedeþ maturacion. And it is made 
þus. Recipe: malue3 tame M. i. or ij; seþe þam in

and presse oute þe watre of þam, and aftir hakke þam 
small wiþ a sharp knyf on a clene borde; þan frye þam 
in a panne ouer þe fire with comon oyle or butter or 
swynes grese, Or, if þe pacient be riche or noble, with 
som of þe forseid oile3. And aftir vpon clene stuppes be 
it put on þe aposteme. And witte þou here þat if þou 
may haue wormed it profiteþ mich in curyng if it be 
|P_13 
soden & made wiþ þe forseid malue3, for þat emplastre 
is best mitigatiue of akyng of pappes, & bryngeþ in 
quytour and conforteþ þe place, and makeþ þe mater 
for to vapour by þe pore3. And for certeyn it availeþ 
in al aposteme3 in euery place of þe body, and also in 
many brissure3. With þis emplastre in cures of pappes I 
haue y-gette many worshippe3 and benefetes, for certaynly 
it is soueraynly mitigatyue. But witte þou after all 
auctours - and I haue proued it for certayn experience - 
þat ane aposteme bredyng nere þe lure owe not to abide 
to it breste by itself, but þe leche owe bisily for to fele 
wiþ his fynger þe place of the aposteme, and wher-so is 
founden any softenes, þer, þe pacient no3t wittyng, warly, 
be it boldely opned wiþ a ful sharp lancette, þat þe 
quitour and þe corrupte blode may gone oute. Or elle3, 
forsoþe þe gutte or þarme þat is called longaon, þat 
deserueþ to þe lure, shal be bristen wiþ-in þe lure, and 
presed byfore þat þe aposteme be bristen withoute-forþe. 
Whiche case byfallyng, if it al-oonly brest within it is of 
hard cure, and þan shal þer be ragadie3 or frousinge3, 
fforsoþ if it briste boþe within and with-out, þan may 
it neuer be cured but by a ful experte cirurgien in his 
crafte. ffor than may it þe firste day be called a fistule; 
siþe a fistule is no3t elle3 þan ane vlcus vndesiccable, 
and for it is vndesiccable, þerfore by consequens it is 
vncurable, siþe no wonde ne vlcus may be heled but if 
it may be dried. Som tyme it bifalleth som men for to 
haue ane hole apperyng outward al-oonly, persyng þur3 
þe longaon within þe lure by þe space of ane ynche 
or of tuo, and bisyde þat anoþer hole with-out, no3t 
persyng þe longaon with-in-forþ. And I haue sene som 
haue 7 or 9 hole3 on þe tone party of þe buttokkis, and 
6 or 5 on þe toþer party, of whiche noon of þam, 
outake oon, persed longaon. And I haue sene som haue 
2 or 3 hole3 on þe buttokke, and 2 or 3 descendyng 
[\f. 146r\] doun into þe codde of þe testicule3. And I haue sene 
som haue oon hole or many in þe tone buttok, and oon 
or tuo on þe party of þe 3erde persyng als wele longaon 
as þe 3erde. And in þis case, as by my demyng, sich 
pacientes bene vncurable, and þat for fistulyng of þe 
|P_14 
3erde. And þat may be knowen, for som-tyme þe 
sperme goþ oute by þe hole of þe 3erde infistulate, and 
som-tyme vryne or bothe. Neþerlesse I cured a preste, 
at lincolne in þe house of Maistre Giffray Scrope, þat 
had aposteme in his 3erde, of whiche als wele vryne as 
quitour come doune into his codde, and sometyme blode 
went oute by þe hole of þe 3erde, and his testicules war 
bolned out of mesure. Therfore, first, I putte on his 
testicule3 oon oyntement ruptorye, and I made an hole by 
whiche went out bothe vryne and quitour; þis i-do, þer 
shewed ane bolnyng vnderneþe in þe 3erde ri3t be þe 
lure, whiche I opned wiþ a ruptorie; whiche y-opned, 
þer went out boþe quitour and vryne. Whom y-cured 
perfitely, oure lord beyng mene; but for certeyne his lure 
& longaon war vnhurte. And witte þou þat þis cure	 
was ful hard. Þerfore in suche þingis be a leche avised 
and discrete. Also a leche owe to be circumspecte in his 
askyngis, þat he enquere bisily of þe pacient if he fele 
ony tyme ventosite3 or egestion3 go out by þe holes of 
þe fistule. Also enquere he of þe pacient 3if he fele 
any heuynes or greuousnes in his heued; Or if it appere 
to hym þat þe house some-tyme is turned vp-so-doune 
as it shuld falle, and þe pacient may no3t for drede of 
fallyng enclyne to þe erthe; And if þe pacient fele 
akyng and heuynes or greuousnes in his lende3 and 
feblenes in his stomake. Also sey he to þe pacient þus: 
'I wote þat þe kynde of þe fistule is soche þat	 
somtyme it is opned by itself and putteþ out quitour, 
somtyme þikke and somtyme þynne, somtyme watery 
and somtyme blody. And sostyme it is closed be itself, 
& so by a moneþ or more þer renneþ no-þing out; and 
eft-sone3 it bigynneþ to ake or þat it caste out quitour. 
And aftirward it is opned by itself, and renneþ as it is 
seid afore, and aftirward it is sperred.' ffor suche pronosticacions 
shewep and tokneth to þe pacient þat þe 
leche is experte in þe knowyng of þe fistule, and so þe 
pacient wil better trist vnto hym. And witte þou, aftir 
Bernard of Gordon, þat þe synowe3 closyng and openyng 
þe lure haþe festnyng with þe stomake and wiþ þe 
ventricule3 of þe brayne, And for this cause suche 
|P_15 
paciente3 ar som tyme vexed in þe heued and in þe 
stomak. When þe leche, forsoþe, haþ talked þus to 
þe pacient, as it is seid, and þe pacient aske & persew 
for to be cured of hym, aske þan first þe si3t of þe 
sekenes; Whiche y-sene, be þe leche war þat he put 
no3t his fynger in þe lure of þe pacient, ne shewe no 
pryue instrumente3 wher-of þe pacient my3t wonder or 
be aferd; or if perauenture þe pacient haue wilyly bro3t 
in with hym any leche for to aspye, as I haue oft tyme 
sene. But considere þe leche bisily þe maner of þe 
fistule, & perceyue if it be curable. 3it a leche ow for 
[\f. 146v\] to feyne perile3 and hardenes of curyng, and for to make 
pronosticacions wilely þat þe sikenes askeþ long tyme 
of curyng, for þat þat þe medicyne3 y-putte to may 
not abyde long for purgyng of þe wombe, and for moche 
moystenes goyng out of þe lure, and for many oþir 
lettyngis, as for þe lure is to streyte, or þe buttokkes be 
to grete or hard, or for þe pacient is waike of herte or vnobedient 
for to persew his cure or for to kepe his diete, and 
for many oþer þat hym ow for to feyue on his owne heued 
þat he supposeth be necessarye. And þise pronosticated, 
if þe pacient stond stedfastly þat he be cured, or aske 
if he may be cured, þan sey þe leche þus: 'I dout no3t, 
oure lord beyng mene, and þi gode pacience folowyng; 
3if þou wilt competently make satisfaccion to me, as sich

of couenant, of whiche couenaunt – al excusacione y-put 
abak - take he þe half byfore hande3; And þan assigne 
a day to þe pacient when he will bygynne. In þe mene

his instrumentis; þat is to sey þat he haue first two 
spongie3 or þre at þe lest, & a rasour or a ful sharp

restrictyue of blode, and warme or leuke watre, and all

oþir necesarie3, þat no-þing wante þat the leche may 
nede in his wirchyng. And ouer al this it is best & 
most sikir þat he kutte no3t in þe lure ne do no violence 
ne greuousnes to it in þe tyme þat þe mone is in Scorpion,

þur3 benefice of nature, be cured of þe fistula in þe legge3

And þat mi3t be for, after Ypocras, alle sekene3 ouþer is

When for-soþ thou knowe3 þat he þat haþ fistule

Which if byfall witte he with-out dout þat þe longaon

when it is nede be it remoued. And considere þe lech 
bisily þe wounde ymundified if it be wele tretable and

Aftirward be þer putte aboue siche ane Emplastre: 
Recipe – þe Iuyse of smalache or merch, wormode, 
Molayne, walworte, Sparge, waybrede, Mugworte, auance, 
petite consoude, wodbynd. Of alle þise herbes, if þou 
may haue þam, take euen porcion, outtake of wodebynde, 
of whiche, if it may be hadde, be taken þe triple or 
quadriple. If al, forsoþe, may not be hadde, take þe 
toþer þat þou may haue, and namely þe þre first 
named wiþ wodebynd if þou may haue it. The confeccion 
is þus: - Take þe Iuse of þe herbes, and be it 
medled wiþ als mich of wele clarified hony, al-wise 
mouyng on an esy fire, and boile tham so long vnto þat 
þe watrynes of þe Iuyse be somewhat þikned; whiche, 
y-take of þe fire and keled, kepe it in a gode potte. It 
may laste al one 3ere or tuo; þerfore when þou wilt vse 
þerof, take of it als mich as it is nede, and putte þerto 
als miche of whites of eiren, wele y-bette and scomed, and 
moue þam togider. Aftir be þer put to þam of subtile 
mele of whete als moche as sufficeþ, and medle þam wele 
to-gidre; þan putte [\f. 148v\] to a litle oyle of olyue, or of fressh 
buttre scomed at þe fire, wiþ als miche virgine wax 
|P_31 
togidre dissolued at þe fire by it self; þan first putte 
aboue þe iuse to þe fire wiþ hony and white of eyren, 
and mouse þam all wayse wiþ a sklyse þat þai cleue 
not to þe panne. When forsoþe it is wele hote but not 
wele y-soþen, be þe wax molten wiþ oile or buttre, as it 
is seyde aboue; whiche y-molten and þe forseid þingis 
beyng hote - þat is to seye þe hony, þe iuse, and þe 
white of eyren - be þai 3etted togidre, and so euermore 
mouyng strongly wiþ a spatour, seþe þam on a softe 
fyre vnto þey be made oon body: whiche y-do, sette it 
of þe fire, and it beyng hote, putte to of terebentyne als 
moche as sufficeþ and moue it strongly wiþ a spature 
vnto þat þe terebentyne be dronken in. And if it be 
nede for to chaufe it more for þe terebentyne, loke þat it 
suffre no3t mych hete, for in seþing loseþ terebentyne 
his my3tes. Þise y-do, be it yputte in a box and 
y-kepte to vse. Take of þis and wiþ a spatour or with 
þi þombe strech it vpon clene lyn stupe3 and softe, and 
put it vpon þe lure, and aboue put a lyn cloute and 
bynde it, as it is seyde, in þe cure of cuttyng. Þis 
emplastre, forsoþe, is called 'diaflosmus,' for molayne 
þat is called flosmus. And not oonly it availeþ in þis 
forseid cure but also in cuttyng of þe fistule; ffor why; 
it heleþ wele alle woundes, þof-al þai be horrible, & 
also bolnyngis in wounde3 and in brissures; and it seseþ 
wele þe akyngis of woundes and of brusours. And it 
eseþ wele þe akyngis and þe bolnyngis of ioyntures; 
þis, forsoþe, haue I ful ofte proued. I sey, forsoþe, 
þat þis emplastre i-had, it is no3t nede in þe forseid 
case3 to renne to oþer medicynes. And witte þou þat 
þer is a naturel vertu in walwort þat moste wele restreyneþ 
blode of woundes, and akyng and bolnyng of 
woundes and of al membre3 it doþ best away. Witte 
þou þat þat confeccion aboue þat receyueþ Smalache, 
wormode, moleyne, sparge, &c, wiþ clarified hony soþen 
togidre at þe fire and kept by itself in a vessell is called 
'Tapsimel.' When, forsoþe, þer is added þerto white 
of eiren and oyle, wiþ wax and whete floure and terebentyne, 
 and ar soþen togidre, þan it is called 'diaflosmus.' 
And þus ow þam to be proporcioned: - Recipe. tapsimel, 
|P_32 
white of eiren - ana +o iiij; whete floure +o iij; oyle, wax - 
ana +o iij; terbentyne +o ij. And witte þou þat if in þe 
tyme of þe makyng of Tapsimel may be founden a litel 
pety morel whiche bereþ white flours and blak grapes or 
berie3, it shuld for certayn make ri3t noble þe emplastre 
diaflosmus. And petite morel is called in fflaundres 
'Naghtstach.' And witte þou þat þe iuse of it doþe 
best awey þe pustules in childres mouþes. 

If forsoþe, þer be many holes persed to-gidre, þan owe 
þe leche als sone as he may for anguissh of þe pacient, 
after þe reperacion of þe first wounde, as it is seid afore, for 
to knytte wiþ a þrede, as it is seyde afore, þe toþer holes 
strongly. Or, if he may, þat is better þat þey be kutte 
al fro oon hole to an-oþer, acu rostrata, þe snowted 
nedle y-putte in þe hole, or som lynne tent, kutte þam 
to þe grounde wiþ a rasour or wiþ a launcete. Whiche 
holes, [\f. 149r\] forsoþe, y-brou3t into oon, be þe wounde als 
soon y-filled of puluer sine pari; Aboue the poudre, forsoþe, 
I putte stupes kutte small, or coton, or carpe of 
lynnen cloþe. Aftir putte aboue þe forseid emplastre 
diaflosmus, and be it bounden as it is seid, and ich day 
oone3 reparailed. I sawe a man of Northamptoun þat 
had þre holes in þe lefte buttok, and þre in þe 
testicle3 codde, and al persed fro oon to anoþer by þe 
midde3 of longaon; whom I cured wiþ cuttyng of al þe 
holes at oon tyme, of longaon as wele as of oþer. Of þe 
kuttyng, forsoþe, of longaon, blode went strongly out, 
for þe fistule was ri3t depe; wherefore þe pacient 
swowned; þerfore I putte to a sponge wette in cold watir 
and receyued þe blode. Aftirward I put in þe kuttyng 
of longaon restrictyues of blode, of whiche it is seid 
aboue, and a gode sponge y-wette in cold watre. I made 
þe pacient for to sitte in a chayer, and als soon þe blod 
was cesed. And aftir refetyng of mete and drink, he went 
into his bedde and sleped wele all þe ni3t, wiþoute 
goyng out of blode. In þe morne, forsoþe, he had hym 
wele; þe seconde day, forsoþe, after þe kuttyng I 
filled all þe woundes of puluer sine pari, and as it 
is seid afore in all þingis, with oile and an ey and 
salus populi and diaflosmus I helid hym finaly wiþ 
|P_33 
in 14 wekes. Whiche, forsoþe, as he seid, he vnder3ede 
þe cure of meny leches, And suffred it ten 3ere. 
And witte þou þat I saw neuer man vnder my 
hand suffre swounyng, outake hym þis; he was forsoþe 
corpulent and waike of hert, but neþerlesse aboute þe 
fourty day after þe kuttyng he rode. I heled anoþer 
man þat had a fistule in þe same maner in all þingis, 
outake þat longaon, was no3t persed; whom I cured wiþ 
kuttyng in þe same maner as it is seid of þe first. I 
haue sene som men hauyng oon hole aloon ni3 þe lure 
þat persed no3t þe longaon, whom I heled wiþ puluer 
sine pari finaly; but for þe mouþe of þe vlcere was 
ouer streit, first I put aboue of vnguento ruptorio of calce 
viue & sape for to large þe mouþe of the fistule; of whiche 
it shal be treted afterward among oþir confeccions. I haue 
sene som men haue tuo holes byside þe lure, of whiche oon 
persed þe longaon and þe toþer persed in no place, but it 
was oonly symple by itself in þe flesshe, hauyng no passyng 
to þe tother hole. Of whiche was such a cure: - The 
hole nerre þe lure was cured wiþ kuttyng or byndyng; 
þe toþer, forsoþe, wiþ poudre sine pare y-put in and 
diaflosmo, and oon emplastre þat is called Neyrbone put 
aboue, whos confeccion shal be shewed aftirwarde. I saw 
also, and, oure lord beyng mene, I heled perfitely a man 
þat had ffistula in ano on þe ri3t side and on þe lefte 
side; whiche, forsoþe, had on þe lefte buttok 8 hole3, and 
þre in þe ri3t buttok; and wiþin was longaon persed 
toward þe ri3t side oonly. But neþerlesse all þe holes of 
aiþer party of þe lure answered togidre in þe grounde 
þat was proued þus. I toke a siryng of siluer and a 
bleddre y-bounden aboute ful of sanguis veneris, and þe 
siryng y-putte in þur3 oon hole and þe bleddre compressed 
wiþ þe fyngers, þe oile in3etted [\f. 149v\] went out by al 
þe holes togidre on boþe sides, and neþerlesse þe hole 
of longaon answered no3t but to oon hole oonly, and þat 
in þe ri3t buttok; þe soþefastnes of whiche þing was 
proued wiþ þe instrument þat is callid sequere me, and 
wiþ acu rostrata, wiþ ful gret hardnes and bisynes; 
þe cure of whiche was suche: ffirst euery day in þe 
lefte buttok þur3 oon of þe holes I 3etted in sanguis 
|P_34 
veneris wiþ þe forseid siring and bledder; whiche y-do, 
I putte in tuo tentes or þre, or lard of pork or swyne in 
þe larger holes; after þat þe depnes of þe fistules asked, 
þe heuedes, forsoþe, of þe tentes war tokned with 
þredes drawen þur3 þe middes wiþ a nedell, þat þe 
tentes shuld no3t be drowned in þe grounde of þe fistules 
when þe tentes war put in. And I putte aboue þe 
emplastre þat is called Neyrbon strecchid vpon lynne 
cloutes, and dewly y-bounden aboute þe lendes wiþ a 
girdill and cloutes y-shapen as it is seid afore. I lefte it in 
pece vnto þe morne. At morne, forsoþe, þe emplastre 
remoued, þer appered aboue 3e emplastre ful putrid 
quitour in superflue quantite. Eftsones in þe secounde 
day I reparailed it in al þingis as in þe first day, and it 
bifell as in þe firste day; and so it continued almost by a 
moneþ. When þe quitour; þerfore, bigynne to lessen 
somwhat, and the bolnyng somwhat to cese, and þe 
colour and þe substaunce of þe skynne for to turne to 
his ovne naturel habitude, þan at þe first turned I to þe 
principale cure of þe fistule with persyng of longaon, 
whiche I cured finaly wiþ byndyng of a þrede in þe hole 
of longaon. Þe toþer hole3, forsoþe, beyng bisyde it I 
cured wiþ cuttyng and with puluer sine pare. Euermore 
continuyng þe cure wiþ þe siryng in þe lefte side, and 
wiþ tentes als long as þay wolde entre in, and þe emplastre 
Neyrbon y-putte aboue, and salus populi and vnguento 
Arabico, vnto a loueable ende wiþ goddes help aboute 
half a 3ere I cured hym, and lefte hym in pece. Also þer 
bene som men þat haþ fistules no3t apperyng outward, 
but þay putte out miche putred & watrye humour, and 
som-tyme clere blode, and somtyme blode y-medled wiþ 
quitour. And þai disese myche þe pacientes and febleþ 
þam. And oft-tymes suche maner sikenes bene toward 
þe rigbone of þe bak ni3 þe lure, þat þay may be feled 
wiþ a fynger. But wheþer pay may be feled or no3t be 
þer done suche a cure wiþ whiche I haue cured many 
men. Be þe pacient putte vpon a bedde wyde opne 
agaynes a wyndowe, li3t shynyng, and þe legges y-raised 
vp and wiþ a towel y-hungen or wiþ a corde ordeyned 
to þis werk; whiche y-do, be þe lure y-opned wiþ 
|P_35 
tonges so y-shape þat when þe vtward endes bene 
streyned togidre þe inner endes be opned & agaynward. 
Or if þe leche kanne ymagyne more couenable instrumentis 
to þe forseid werk to be done, for so moche loued 
be god þat streyngþes mannes witte in godes. þe lure, 
forsoþe, y-opened, and þe sikenes bisily y-sene, be þe 
hole of þe sikenes y-filled wiþ puluer sine pare, and 
coton y-putte aboue; be þe tonges warly drawen out þat 
þai spill no3t þe poudre, or þat þei hurt no3t þe pacient. 
Whiche y-drawen out, and þe legges laten doun, late þe 
pacient long reste or þat he go, þat þe poudre be [\f. 150r\] no3t 
letted for to go; and abide it stille vnto þat þe 
pacient clense his wombe; and if þe pacient may abstene 
hymself fro þe pryuè by two dayes, it war full necessary 
to hym. When þe pacient, forsoþe, ow to be reparaled, 
þan be þe lure wasshen and dried; whiche y-wasshen, be 
þer 3ette in of a 3olk of an ey wiþ sanguis veneris to 
esyng of þe ake þat comeþ of puluer sine pare, and to 
þe clensyng of þe vlcer of flessh mortified by þe forseid 
poudre. And þis cure continue þe leche by fife dayes 
or mo, þat is to sey of þe 3olk and of sanguis veneris, 
vnto þat he se þe pacient wele alegedde of þe first 
akyng. Whiche y-do, þan owe þe leche in þe best 
maner þat he may for to opne þe lure and bisily biholde 
wiþin, and considere if þe sikenes be mortified; whiche 
is knowen if þat þe vlcer seme depper þan it was sene 
afore þe puttyng in of þe poudre, and also by oþer 
tokenes þat a gode leche fyndeþ more experte of long 
exercise. In þis þerfore to be yknowen be no3t þe 
leche slowe; for why; þer shal folow no3t litle louyng 
þerof þerfore if it be no3t mortified be it eftsones 
filled of puluer sine pare, and be it sewed in all þingis as 
it is seid afore, wiþ þe 3olk of an ey, & wiþ sanguis 
veneris, vnto þat he se efte-sones þe pacient wele alegged, 
as it is seid afore. When, forsoþe, he. troweþ þat it is 
mortified, þan it is to turne agayne to anoþer cure, þat 
is to sey þat he take þe 3olke of an ey to whiche be 
added þe half parte of tapsimell, and als miche as sufficeþ 
of poudre of alumme 3ucaryne y-brent. And be it so 
made þat it may be 3etted in by a Nastar of tree; and 
|P_36 
þis cure be continued al-oonly by þre or foure dayes: 
 þe fourþe, forsoþe, or þe fifthe day aftir þis medicyne 
done to, be þe vlcer reparaled wiþ þe 3olk of an ey and 
sanguis veneris þre or foure dayes continued. And so 
owe þe leche for to chaunge his hande fro oon medycyne 
to anoþer, vnto þat he se þe superflue moistene3 firste 
goyng out for to cesse; þat is tokne of cure or help beyng 
ni3e. þan, forsoþe, may he with vnguento arabico and 
salus populi finaly spede þe forseid cure aboute four & 
tuenty wekes, or more or lesse, aftir þat þe pacient be 
obedient and bisy; ffor why; gret spede of werk standeth 
in þe paciens and bisynes of þe pacient. And it is to 
witte þat in all vlcerie3 beyng wiþin þe lure, or moiste 
ragadiis puttyng out quitour or blode, þis I sey þat þe 
vlcere3 be no3t bubones, i. e. owles, of whiche it shal be seid 
aftirward, for þai be al vncurable: þat if a leche may 
no3t wiþoute grete anguissh, als wele of hymself as of þe 
pacient, opne þe lure of þe pacient wiþ tonges, as it is 
seide afore, þan owe þe leche oonly putte in of tapsimell 
and puluer sine pare medled togidre in suche þiknes þat 
it may be 3etted in by a nastare of tree. For why; þis 
medicyne mortifieþ wele and clenseþ putred flessh in an 
vlcere. But witte þou þat euermore aftir þe 3ettyng in 
of tapsimell wiþ þe forseid poudre, þou ow in þe nexte 
reparalyng for to 3ette in wiþ a nastare of tre of þe 3olk
