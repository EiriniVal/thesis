[^JOHN OF BURGUNDY, PLAGUE TREATISE 1^] 
 
|P_73 
Here begynnyth a noble tretis maad of a good phisician 
John of Burdeaux for medicina agenst the pestilence evil and 
it is departed into iiij capters. The first telleth, how man shal 
kepe hin in tyme of the pestilence, that he falle not in the 
evel. The seconde telleth home the sikenes cometh. The iijde 
telleth medicine ageyn the evel. The iiij telleth houw he shall 
be kept in it. 
 
The clerc seith in the first chaptre that for ye default of 
good rulyng ane dyetyng in mete an drynke men fallen often 
into this sikenes. Therefore whenn the pestilence regneth in 
countre, the man that wol be kept fro that evel hym nedeth 
hym to kepe fro outrage and excesse in mete and oke drynke. 
ne vse noo bathes. ne swete not to moche for alle thyse 
openeth the porys of the body and maketh the venonys ayre 
to enter and distroyeth the lyfly spirites in man and enfebleth 
the body and souueraignely hauntyng of lecherye, for that enfebleth 
the kymde and openeth the pores, that wicked ayre 
may entre and enuenygne the spirites of man. Also vse litel or 
noughte of these, garlik, vuyons [\onyonys\], lakes en other suche 
metes that bringeth aman into on vnkyndely hete. Also suffre 
not gretly thurst that tyme and yef thou thruste gretly, leke 
thou drinke but mesurably to sleke thy thurste, and the best 
drynke were colde water menged with vinaigre or tysan for 
that maner of drynke is right good namely to theym that be 
coleryk of complexion. for thei ben hote and drey and comonly 
lene of body. 
 
The seconde chaptre telleth how this sikenes cometh and 
what is cause thereof. In men ben iij principal parties and 
membres, that is to seye, the hert, the lyver and the brayne, 
and eche of these haue their clensyng place, wher he may putte 
oute his superfluitees and clense hym. the hert hath his clensyng 
place vnder the armes. The clensyng place of the lyver 
is bytwene the thyes and the bodye and in theez holys. But 
the clensing place of the brayne is under the eares or under 
the throte. Then this evel cometh thus. whenne the pores ben 
open for some cause aforsaid, the aeyr venemous enterth and 
anon [\?\] mengeth with mannes blood and so renneth to the 
hert, that is grounde and rote of lyfe of mannys kynde for to 
destroye it and slee the man. The hert kyndely fleeth that is 
ageyne it and putteth the venym to his clensyng place and be 
cause that that place is stopped, that it may not oute. it passeth 
to the next principal parties, that is the lyver, for to destroy it. 
And hit in the same wyse putteth it to his clensyng place, and 
for that is stopped, also that is may not oute, it passeth to the 
thrid principal partie, that is the brayne, and he putteth it to 
the clensyng place xij houres or more. And thenne at the 
laste win xxiiij oures, yef it be not passand out with bledyng, 
it festnyth in som place and casteth aman into an agu and maketh 
|P_74 
a bocche in som of the three clensyng places or nyghe 
theym. 
 
The iij, chaptre telleth how may be helpe agayne this 
evel and whenne it may be wel helped. Whoo soo falleth in 
this evel and feleth any pryckyng or flakeryng of blood, it is 
tokenyng toward this sikenes. Therfor they sholde sone yef 
thei may withinne the fyrste houre or withinne vj houres after, 
and yef it be not yette, thenne drinke not ne ete or it be, and 
tarye not over xij houres, for al that tyme the matter is moeving 
for cause aforesaid. And certaynly bledyng by tyme on 
the veynes that I shal telle, shal have it aweye. But yef it 
passe xxiiij houres for the matier thenne is gadered and 
harded and wol not passe out of the veyne though it be 
smyten. Neverthelis, yef aman blede, then it shal not harme, 
but it is not siker, that it may helpe; yef the matier be gadred 
vndre the armehole, it cometh of the herte and thenne blede, 
on ye veyne yat is called the cardiac and on the same side 
whet ye evel is in. Or elles ther is ij harmes of oon. Oone is 
yef thou blede in the other side, the gode blode and clenne 
in thy bodye not corrupte ne venemyd shall be drawe out, and 
the evel shal dvelle, stylle and the bodye is fabler for the defaulte 
of good blood, that wolde have holped the kynde. That 
other harme is for that the blode, that is envenymed, shal passe 
overtward the herd and envenygne it and hast aman to his 
endyng. Yef ye sykents be bitwene the thies and the body, 
it is of the lyver, and thenne yef the matier appere in ye innermore 
syde of the privye [\priny?\] thing [\members\], blede 
on ye fote and the same side, and that that be on ye veyne 
betwixt grete too and the too, that is next is. For it the bocche 
be ther and thou blede on the arme, the mater wol drawe up 
agayne to the principal parties, the hart or ye lyver, and doo 
harme. Also yef the matiere [\ala bocche\] be more 
outewaid to the syde and ferther fro the pryve thing [\glace\], 
blede on the veyne bitwene the ancle and the hele or on the 
veyne, that is under the ancle, that is called sophena, or elles 
be thou ventused on the thyes with a boxe beside the bocche. 
Yef the matiere appere in the clensyng place of ye lyver hed 
or the armes, blede on the veyne, that is called cephalica, that 
is to seye the hedde veyne on the same arme and he lyeth 
above the cody veyne, scilicet cardiac in the bought of the 
arme, or elles blede on the veyne, that is above the hande, 
bitwene se thombe and the next fynger, or elles be thou ventused 
bitwene the shulders with boxes, tyl the blood be drawen 
oute. And the principal membre thus clensed, the hert shulde 
be conforted pith colde electuaries to tempre the grete hete 
yerof. Dithee it were good to have water stilled of these iiij 
|P_75 
herbes: ditana, pimpernell, tormentill and stabiouse. And this 
is agode medicine in the sikenes and to kepe fro hit. 
 
The fourthe captre talleth, hov that aman shal be kepte, 
that is fallen into the sikenes. Whiles aman is in the sikenes, he 
sholde be dieted mesurably for the fever agueis evermore 
with this sikenes. And while aman is in this fever ague of 
this sikenes he sholde not ete flesshe gretly, but yef it were 
litel chekyns soden with water or fresshe water fysshe or 
other fresshe fysshe rosted to ete with vinegre. Also it is good 
thenne to ete potage of almondes and drynke tysan or in the 
hete smal ale an thynne. And yef the sike man covereth gretly 
to drynke wyn, gyve hye therfore vinegre medled with water, 
but white wyne of the Rene is beter than rede to use mesurably 
yinne [\?\]. Also it is good to use a powder that is good 
ageyn all venym, that is maade of these herbes or som 
of them, that may beste be goten: ditane, pimpernelle, tormentil, 
scabious, bole armonyac and terra sigillat, the ji last 
named spicers have to selle. Everiche of the herbes or spicerye 
brayed by them helfe and drinke with wyne or ale dryveth 
out venyme by the same place, where it hadde entre, 
yef a man be veneme. Therfore whoo that dredeth hym of 
his sekenes, kepe hym fro thynke envennemyd as in the frost 
chaptre, and whoo soo is yerinne doo by tyme and rule hym as 
the other capiters of this tretis techen hym, and through the 
growe of god he shalle fro this sekems kept and deliverd, for 
yer is no sikenes in kynde, that hath holpe it in kynde.
