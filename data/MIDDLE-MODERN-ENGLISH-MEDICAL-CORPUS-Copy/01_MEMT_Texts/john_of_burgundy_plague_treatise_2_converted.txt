|P_182 
[\f. 43r\] Et iam incipit tractatus Iohannis de Barba alias dicti Iohannis de 
Burdegalia extractus in lingua Anglicana contra morbum pestilencialem 
siue epidemialem. 
 
Here begynnyth a noble tretys made of a gode phisician [\f. 43v\] 
Iohn of Burdeux for medycyne ageyne the pestilence evill. And it is departid 
in foure chapitres. The furst tellith hou a man shall kepe hym in tyme 
of pestilence that he fall nat into that evill. The ij=d= tellith hou this sekenes 
coomyth. The thrid tellith medicyn ayen this evill. The foourth tellith 
hou he shall be kepte in hit. 
 
This clerk seith in the furst chapitre that for defaute of gode reulyng 
& dietyng in mete & drynk men fallen often into this sekenesse. Therefor, 
whan the pestilence reyneth in countre, the man that will be kept from 
that evill hym nedith to kepe [\f. 44r\] hym from outrage & excesse in 
me[{t{]e & drynk, ner vse no batthis, ne swete not to mych, ffor all these 
openeth the porys of the [{b{]ody & makith the venemous air to entre & 
distroith the lyfly spiritis in man & enfeblith the body; & souereynly hauntyng 
of lechery, for that both enfeblith the kynde & openeth the pooris 
that the wikkid air may entre & envenym the spiritis of man. 
 
Also, vse litill that tyme frutes but yif that bee soure frutes & litill 
or nought of these: garlyk, onyons, leekis, or othir such metis þat bryngith 
a man into vnkyndly hete. Also, suffir nat gretly [\f. 44v\] thirst that 
tyme. And yif thou thirst gretly, looke thou drynke but mesurably to slake 
thi thurst & the hete. And the best drynk were colde watir mengid with 
vynegre or tysanne, for þat maner of drynk is right gode namly to them 
tha[{t{] be coloryk of complexion, for they arn hote & drye & comonly 
lene of body. 
 
[}Capitulum Secundum}] 
The secunde chapitre tellith hou this sekenesse coomyth & what is 
þe cause thereof. In man [{are{] iij principall parties & membris: the harte, 
the lyver, & the brayne; & euerych hath his clensyng place where he may 
put out his superfluytees & clense hym. 
 
The harte hath his clensyng place [\f. 45r\] vndir the armes. The 
|P_183 
clensyng place of the lyver is betwene thee thies & the body & these hooles. 
But the clensyng place of the brayne is vndir the eares or vndir the throte. 
 
Than this evill comyth þus. Whan the poris ben opyn for sum cause 
aforeseide, the air venemous entrith and anon mengith with a mannys 
blode and so renneth to þe harte that is grounde & roote of lyf & mannys 
kynde for to distroy it and sle the man. The harte kyndely sleeth that 
is ageyne it & contrarius to it & puttith the venyme to his clensyng place. 
And by cause that þat place is stoppid þat it may not oute, it passith to 
þe [\f. 45v\] next principall parties, that is the lyver for to destroy it. And 
it on the same wise puttith it to his clensyng place, and for that is stoppid 
also that it may not oute, it passith to the thrid principall party, that is 
the brayne, and he puttith it to his clensyng place and yit it may not oute 
there. And thus a long tyme it is moevyng or that it rest in any place 
xij houre3 & more. 
 
And than at last with-in xxiiij hours, yif it be not passand oute 
with bleedyng, it fastenyth in sume place & castith a man in an ague & 
make a bocche in sum of the iij clensyng places or nygh them. 
 
[}Capitulum Tertium}] 
The iij chapitre tellith help ageyns [\f. 46r\] this evill and whan 
it may be wele helpid. 
 
Who-so feelith any prikkyng of blode or flakeryng, it is token towarde 
this sekenesse. Þerfor, they shulde blede sone yif it myght bee within 
the furst houre or within vj hours aftir. And yif it be not yit, than drynk 
not ne ete or it bee & tary nat ovir xij hours, for all þat tyme the mater 
is mouyng for cause aforesaide. 
 
And certeynly bledyng betyme on the veynes that I shall tell shall 
haue it awey, but yif it passe xxiiij houres, the mater than is gedird & 
hardid and will not passe oute of the veyne though yt be smyten. Nevirthelees, 
yif a [\f. 46v\] man blede than, it shall not harme, but it is not 
sikyr that it may helpe. 
 
Yif the matir be gadird vndir outhir armehole, it comyth of the hart, 
and than blede of the veyne þat is callid cardiak, and on the same side 
that the evill is in, or els is there ij harmes of oon. Oon this: yif thou 
blede on the othir side, the gode blode & clene in thy side not corrupte 
ne venymed shall be drawe oute, and the evill shall duell stille. Than 
the body is febler for defaute of gode blode that wolde haue helpid the 
kynde. That othir harme is for that the blode that is venymed shall passe 
ovir-thwart the harte & envenyme it [\f. 47r\] and haste a man to his 
endyng. 

|P_184 
Yif the seekenesse be betwene thee thies and the body, it is of the 
lyvir. Than yif the mater appere in the innermore side of the priuy thyng, 
blede on the foote and the same side, and that shall be on the veyne betwix 
the grete to & the to þat is next it. Ffor yif the bocche be there & 
thou blede on the arme, the mater will drawe vp ageyne to the principall 
parties of the harte or the lyver & do harme. 
 
Also, yif the mater bee more outewarde to the side & ferthir fro the 
priuy thyng, blede on the veyne betwene the anklee & the hele or on the 
veyne that is [\f. 47v\] evyn vndir the anklee, that is callid sophen, or 
els be thou ventusid on thee thee3 with a box beside the bocche. 
Yif the mater appere in the clensyn[{g{] place of the hede or the armes, 
blede on the veyne that is callid cephalica, that is to sey the hede veyne, 
on the same arme. (The hede veyne lieth aboue the bodye veyne: scilicet, 
cardiak in the boought of the arme.) Or els blede on þe veyne that is 
aboue the hande, betwene the thombe & the next fynger. Or els be thou 
ventusid betwixt the shuldirs with boxis to the blode be drawen out, and 
the pryncipall membre thus clensid, the harte shulde be [\f. 48r\] confortid 
with colde electuaries to tempir the grete hete thereof. 
 
Sithen it were gode to haue watir stillid of these iiij yerbes: ditane, 
pimpernell, turmentill, & scabious. And this is gode medicyne in this 
sekenesse. 
 
[}Quartum Capitulum}] 
The fourth chapitre tellith hou that a man shall be kept that is fallyn 
into this sekenesse. 
 
Whiles a man is in this sekenes, he shuld bee dietid mesurably, for 
the feuer ague is evirmore with this sekenes. And while a man is in the 
feuer ague of this sekenes, he shuld not ete flesshe gretly but yif it were 
litill chekons sothen with watir or [\f. 48v\] fressh-watir fisshe or othir 
smale fressh fisshe rostid to ete with vynegre. 
 
Also, it is gode than to ete potage of almandis and drynk tysan or, 
in the hete, small ale & thyn. And yif the seke man coovet gretly to drynk 
wyne, geve hym therefor vynegre medlid with mych watir, but white wyn 
of the Ryne is bettir than red to vse mesurably therein. 
 
Also, it is gode to vse a poudir that is gode ageyn all venyme, that 
is made of these erbes, or sum of them þat may best be goten: ditane, 
pimpernell, turmentill, scabious, bolle armoniak, and terra sigillata. Þe 
too last namyd, spicers haue to sell. 
 
Euerich of these erbes or spicery [\f. 49r\] brayde by them-self and 
|P_185 
droonkyn with wyne or ale dryveth oute venyme by the same place where 
it hadd entree yif a man bee venymed. 
 
Therefor, who that dredith hym of this sekenesse, kepe hym from 
thyng envenymed in the first chapitre. And who-so therein do by tyme 
and reule hym as the othir chapitres of this tretys techyn hym and 
tho[}r}]ugh the grace of God, he shall from this sekenesse be kepid & 
delyu[}er}]ed.
