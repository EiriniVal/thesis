[^DE SPERMATE^] 
 
|P_161 
[\f. 28r\] Sperme of man descendith of al the humours of the body 
that it be made more subtile in nature of the iiij humours 
of mannes body. Forsoth this sperme hath nerues and veynes propirly 
even drawyng from al the body to the testicules or ballokkes, 
that nervis and veynes of frotyng and chaufyng of man and 
womman putten out as with smytyng of jrn and stone fuyre, 
whiche nervis and veynes bien dyuersed from the nervis and veynes 
of the vryne. Vryne forsoth hath propir nervis and veynes, þe 
whiche bien his. 
 
Note that the sperme of man is strengger and hotter than 
the sperme of womman. Forsoth the sperme of womman 
is the nutryment and norisshyng of mannes sperme. After the nature 
of the sperme principaly of more subtile nature of bloode 
[\f. 28v\] and fleame and [\red\] coler and [\blac\] coler forsoth in the tyme that man and womman 
felawshipen with frotyng and chaufyng of nervis and veynes, 
thei putten out that is complete and animat that associat to the 
sperme of the womman receivith with suche a spirite in þe matrice 
|P_163 
of the womman, wher it fattith of the heete of the matrice and with 
a spirite attract and drawen to bi subtile arteries. 
 
Note for why ther is another spirite whiche cometh bi subtil 
arteries and favourith the matrice withoutfurth and anoþer 
spirite is whiche norisshith with either sperme in the 
matrice. He forsoth whiche is spirite withoutfurth ne suffrith 
nat the spirite withynfurth to go out but constreyneth hym to 
norisshe and to warme the chield. After forsoth ther comyth into the 
matrice suche another spirite beyng of more subtile nature of bloode 
and joyneth hymsilf with the sperme and turnyth it into carnal 
and fleshly nature bi heete of the matrice til the lyver tornyth fleame 
into bloode in ij vessels in whiche he workith strongly his werk 
with vertue of the galle. Nor it is no wounder for whi the lyver yieldiþ 
with his grete werkis and with his werkis of the galle into bloode, 
for whi grete werkis nedith to that tornyng that is hevyng in bloode. 
But the spirite, whiche is of more subtile nature of bloode, þerof 
nedith [\nat\] suche werkis, for whi he turnith that sperme that he owiþ 
|P_165 
more lightly of more subtile nature of bloode bi the heete of the matrice 
into bloode. 
 
To whom or fro whom, that is to say sperme or toguyder 
spermes of man and womman but to whom to suffre 
incongrue or vncovenably sittith bi natural heete and euery day drawith 
bloode to his norisshyng and to drawe torneth into flessh. 
After that forsoth passith flessh into forme and shap of man. þo 
thynges forsoth whiche is nat animate neither growith ne mynushiþ. 
But sperme euery day growith bi natural spirites, and to 
growe cometh that part of man to his nature and propirte, havyng 
similitude and liknes othyng with another, that is to say sharp 
thynges with sha[{r{]pe thynges hath the similitude, nat fynger with 
|P_167 
fynger, arterie with arterie, as joyntes, bones, and so furth in other 
thynges. First forsoth bien formed the shuldres, of whiche the 
hede and sides and armes and elbowes, of the sides the reynes, 
of the reynes the ribbes after toguyder with joyntes, and after 
that oon is forme of another. Furthermor bien formed nerves and 
[\f. 29r\] veynes, and after that innermore nature alwey sendith his armony 
to the nutryment and norisshyng of al the body withyn and without. 
The bowels forsoth bien made of the spirite. 
 
It is to be noted for a soth that at thend of xxx daies the 
figure of man appierith and the figure of womman at 
xl daies. After that forsoth whiche figure appierith, growith 
the chield and fattith, and than the mowth openyth. From that 
bigynnen bones to engrosse of heete comyng in the matrice bi the natural 
spirite. He forsoth hath heete and vertu to comforte al the body bi that 
spirite. 
 
|P_169 
It is to be noted that bones bien made principaly of iiij 
humours, as of the heviest nature of bloode purged, mory forsoth 
of that more subtile nature of that hevy bloode. The bones 
forsoth bien sharped of the composicioun and makyng of fyngers, 
handis, and feete. 
 
It is to be wist and knowen that bi 3 monethis past in þe 
man and iiij in the womman bigynne the veynes to issue 
to the constitucioun and makyng of the nailes. From than bigynneþ 
the chield to moeve in the wombe, and after that menstr[{ua{]t of bloode, 
whiche is made cotidianly of mete and drynke in the bodie of the 
moder, dryven into the briest, willyng to issue with his subtilite 
bi poores [\which (it)\] openyth and cometh into the teatis and ther of heete and 
humydite chaungith the teatis into whitnes and swetnes. But þe 
more part of that menstruat descendith into the matrice to norisshe 
the chield. And so cotidianly the chield is norisshed of bloode descendyng 
to the matrice, whiche, that is to say menstruate, put out bifore the 
tyme conceived. Witnes Ipocras seyeng, "I sawe a womman preignaunt 
|P_171 
with chield leten bloode bi the arme and so the thrid day 
sent out abortief." The causes therfor considred whi it fille, it 
appierith the nature of the womman to withold bloode to the 
reformacioun of hir chield. No wounder that a man hath nat menstruat 
so as womman, for whi a man hath poores bi whiche his 
bloode issueth, whiche torneth into pilis, as it appierith in armes 
and in feete and in other parties, bi mowth and nose sendith out a 
strengger spirit than a womman, bi whiche is dryed the humour 
of that bloode whiche is sent out bi swet. So his bloode, dryed 
from his propir heete the fume of hymsilf gendrith, whiche issueþ 
bi mowth and nose and bi swet and bi pilis, whiche subtile 
pooris issuen. Forsoth a womman sendith nat so moche out as a man, 
[\f. 29v\] for whi she is nat of so moche heete. 
 
Forsoth if the matrice be long and strait, long and sclender 
shal the chield be. If it be short and straite, short and 
sclender shal the chield be. If it [\be short and grete,\] short and grete shal the chield be. 
If it be grete and long, grete and long shal the chield be. 
 
|P_173 
It is to be noted that a womman hath vij cellis or receptacles 
wher sperme is received. Forsoth if sperme fal in 
oo vessel or in many, so many chieldren bien formed as vessels receyven 
sperme. That if sperme fal in the right side of the 
matrice, it shal be a man, and this comyth bi nature of the lyver, 
whiche is equaly hote and moiste of nature, and the galle, that is 
hoote and drye of nature. Forsoth if the sperme of man beyng [\fieble\] falle 
in the right side of the navil and be associed to the sperme of the 
womman strengger than hymsilf, lieful it may be a man, but only 
he shal be wommanly, as it is in sum men, as in wordis, in maners, 
and in many other thynges, and to so moche fieblenes mannes sperme [\may become\] 
that the chield shal be of both kyndes. If sperme falle in the 
lift side, it shal turne into femynyne nature, and this cometh of 
the mylt, havyng cold and dry nature, and of the nature of fleame, 
that is cold and moist. That if the sperme of the man prevale 
the sperme of the womman in the lift side, it may liefully 
torne into wommankynde, oonly shal withold sum manly tacchis, 
as generaciouns, berd, and grete wordis, etc. And suche fiebilnes 
may the sperme of womman bicome that it may be made 
|P_175 
of either kynde, as it is saide above of the man. Also if sperme 
fal in the right side of the womman, he shal be of lifly strength, 
and if the lift side of the womman, but of the fiebilnes of the 
sperme, as it is saide, it shal become. It is to be noted also that 
if the sperme of man be strong and without debilite or fiebilnes, it shal 
be a man, if it be fieble, a womman. 
 
It is to be wist and knowe that the organs of sperme bien 
veynes and arteries, in whiche bloode is torned into sperme 
in this maner. Forsoth so as it turnyth bloode into the teates 
of womman into mylke bi sum decoccioun, so bloode is turned into 
scotorisiton, that is to say substaunce heete and humydite, havyng the 
figure of fleame in arterijs and veynes to the norisshyng of hem, and 
to norissh veynes and arteries turnyth tho substaunces into sperme, þat 
the sperme therof ascendith to the hede and with grete subtilite of 
[\f. 30r\] veynes and poores descendith from thens bi ij veynes and ij arterijs 
vnto the testiculis. It is to be wist for a soth that to sum man it is wont 
to come that the sperme descendyng from the hede stoppith the pooris of the 
nostrels and eeris that the vital or quikly breth may neither entre nor 
|P_177 
issue. Forsoth after that in so moche it growith in his veynes and arterijs 
that it may nat descende, therfor ther is associat to hym grete multitude 
of bloode, and gendrith in his jowis suche a passioun whiche is cald in 
Greeke liqoides and in Latyne lupus, that is to say stranglyng. 
 
And therof may be proved that sperme principaly is made of 
bloode and secundarily of other humours, for whi men above maner 
vsyng Venus werkis failyng sperme sheden bloode. Forsoth if it 
may wele descende from the hede without any jmpedyment, it goeth 
dividyng hymsilf bi a veyne and an arterie to a testicule and bi anoþer 
veyne and another arterie goeth to another testicle, whiche testicules han 
iiij pannycles, of the whiche ij han heete and humydite, other ij han 
acucioun, whiche acucioun ooneth the sperme. Thei han also iiij vessels, 
that is to say the veynes abovesaide and arterijs, and iiij semytories, 
|P_179 
that is to say pannycles, wherof ij reteynen the right and [\veray\] 
and natural sperme of right seede. Other ij bien ahenes, that is to say 
drawyng and purgyng sperme. Forsoth sumtyme whan sperme 
to descende watery fleame that from theym bien withhold and put 
out sumtyme slepyng, sumtyme wakyng, whiche, that is for to say 
semytories, alwey liquite, of whiche sharp liquore the testicules receyven 
a grete jiche and brennyng, wherof the wil of Venus werkis 
gendrith. 
 
|P_181 
The testicules han also ij nervis hangyng and descendyng from 
the chief bon of the nek and to the fundament of the bodie. 
And it is to be noted that oo veyne of sperme is propirly voide from 
other whiche receivith that sperme to thother iiij veynes. He forsoth 
thei receiven of other comyng from al parties and from bones havyng 
mary, whiche veyne leedith that sperme to the hede, wherof iiij of þe 
forsaide veynes is of suche nature. Oon is next the reynes. Anoþer 
next the hert and the stomac, the thrid in the briest beyng strecchiþ 
next the lung, the iiij forsoth is nygh the formosite or shap vngous 
and gibbous or of nail, in whiche is power of bloode, wherof it shedith 
bi al the body, of whos superfluite growen and bien born spasmes, 
|P_183 
apoplexies, diafragmes, apostemes in many maners, and many other 
passiones. In the briest forsoth power of fleame, wherof shedith out 
bi al the bodie, of whos superfluite is made asmes. Forsoth þe first 
[\f. 30v\] asme is made of corrupcioun of the aire entryng to the lunges. The 
secunde forsoth of fumosite of fleame to the hede ascendyng and 
from thens goyng ageyn to the lunge, and apoplexies, diafragmes, 
and apostemes of many kyndes, and other passiones cronite in musculis 
of the briest, whiche bien organs spirites, whiche to hym drawith to þe 
lunge and from hym sendith into al the cordis the word to puttynges 
out and many other passions. 
 
|P_185 
Blac coler forsoth hath his power in the reynes, wherof rennyth 
bi al the body, of whos superfluite bien born passions 
in reynes, as the stone, and sperme and therof wastith, and ache in the 
wombe gendrith so that sumtyme a man may nat hold his vryne, and 
sumtyme he may nat sende it out. And in al the nervis vnto the feete 
the reynes also suffrith of drynes cometh therof, wherof as [\with\] a womman 
lith first and suffrith solucioun beyng of fieble sperme. Vpon the 
reynes also gendrith aposteme, of whiche sumtyme bien made wormes 
and other passions. 
 
It is to be wist that the abovesaide humours han propir seetis 
and dyuers from theym of the whiche it is saide in whiche 
thynges thei han their powers. Forsoth the propir setis of bloode is the 
lyver, fleame forsoth the lung, of coler rede the galle, blac coler 
the milt. [\Rede\] coler [\with\] the power that he hath in the stomac he puttith 
it out sum fumosite of the hede, wherof comen aches, that is 
|P_187 
to say diafragmes, apostemes, and other passiouns. Therof also descendith 
catarris to the lung, wherof cometh asmes, ptises, and 
pustules or bleynes gendren in the lunge. Whan forsoth the sperme 
descendith from the hede, he takith to the veynes abovesaide and arterijs 
whiche descenden to the testicules. And it is to be wist that bifore 
it come to the testicules, descendith bi tho places in whiche 
the humours abovesaide exercisen their power, and euerywher that 
they comen, takith the nature of that humour whiche ther dwelliþ. 
In vnfrago he is made hote and moist, in the briest he chaungith into 
cold and moist, fforsoth in the hert and stomac in heete and drye, 
and for whi sperme, as it is saide, receivith the propirte of the iiij 
humours. Therfor a man of theym made reteigneth and witholdith 
the propirte of hem, liefully oo propirte more he hath. Forsoth the nature 
of the sperme complete in the reynes, descendith to the testicules that 
ther it be clensed and complete and receyved into the matrice of the 
womman. 
 
It is to be noted that if the sperme of man overhabunde the 
sperme of the womman, the chield shal be like to the fader in 
[\f. 31r\] face and other thynges. Forsoth if the sperme of the womman habundith 
over toguyder, he shal be like to the moder in al thynges, but for whi the sperme 
|P_189 
of hir is the nurishyng of the mans sperme. If forsoth thei bien 
equal, he shal hold the face and chier of eyther. It happenyth also sumtyme 
that the humour of that oon ouerhaboundith the humours of that 
other, the chield shal nat be like neither fader ne moder, for whi other humours 
enfieblen, that is for to say for the superfluite of that oon. Sumtyme 
forsoth of holle fader and holle moder we see a chield born halt, 
laame, or croked mowth or nose havyng, and so appierith a chield to 
have dyuers forme of fader and moder for the superfluite of humours or 
also sumtyme for the chaunge, for whi that power that the sperme hath 
in his place, the same nature it hath in the matrice. It happith 
that of the fader occupied with dyuers passiouns or of the moder drawith 
the chield toguyder with passiouns, sumtyme also of norisshyng 
of mylk. 
 
It is to be seen that if the sperme of man have power in al the 
body, so nature hath power in the matrice. So forsoth bloode, 
of whos subtilite is made sperme, hath power to go bi al the body, 
so sperme that therof is made hath power to go bi the body without 
|P_191 
voluptuosite or lust of the man slepyng or wakyng. So and as 
nature of the body to folowe the iiij chaunges of the day chaungith 
the body after tho, so nature chaungith sperme in the matrice after 
the chaunges. Nature of mannes body propirly is saide the subtilite 
of the fumosite principaly of bloode, secundarily forsoth of other 
humours, also of aire dryvyng and moevyng that bloode into veynes 
and arterijs, whiche subtilite fixed in flessh is the temperament or 
temperaunce of al the membres and humours, witnessyng Galien. 
For whi nature is the meane degre in heete and humydite and temperament 
of commyxtioun, wherof comen viij that sum bien 
colerik, sum sangwyn, sum flewmatic, sum malencolic. But 
this was and al wern of the same nature. But it may that nature 
|P_193 
to chaunge in sum man outher bi age or bi tyme or bi diete or bi 
sum other, but natural propirtes wern the same. So as of bloode, þe 
whiche naturaly wrathes, liefully senden out wrath from the herte, 
procedyng outher bi tyme or bi other, alwey bien of bloode, and so it may 
be seen that nature chaunghith nat but his propirtes, and so restith nature. 
Forsoth so as fuyre first sharply kyndelith and after that restith 
and nat oonly leesith his nature, so nature liefully first kyndelith 
and sharpith and after restith and nat oonly chaungith. Also it 
is to be noted that if sperme fal in iiij tymes of bloode, the nature of 
[\f. 31v\] hym chaungith and sikelith after the nature of bloode, wherof a 
man therof made hath rede colour, his vpper browes hevy, the 
veynes of the tymples hevy and ful of bloode, sangwyn eyn 
and clowdy or alwey habundaunt of passiouns, face and lippes 
rede, the gommes habundaunt with bloode. Of bloode alwey rennyng 
from the nosethrilles. Forsoth of the throte with moche 
bloode hevy, horse, and fieble of speche, the throte also of hym, 
hede, mowth, and teeth wont to ake, the heris tenden to rednesse, his 
|P_195 
goyng and walkyng moderatly and manerly, passiouns of rewme 
of bloode and sinocha and other passiouns whos natures bien of 
bloode. 
 
Forsoth whan sperme fallith in tymes of rede coler, the 
[{n{]ature of hym chaungith to the propirte of rede coler, the 
body forsoth wherof it is compownd and made is white and rede 
to the colour citryne, the heris like citryne, gret veynes and large, 
and ful rede eyen and therfor citryne, colour often of chiere is grene. 
Mowth and throte and alwey spittyng bittyr and drye, 
his thies, knees, and feete shuln ake. In subtile veynes fevers or accesse, 
and broken bones shal be seen vnto hym and dry rewme bi al 
the body, wherof growith the passioun of the goute and ache in 
wombe, as dissinterie, transumpcioun of the wombe, lienterie, in 
sleepe dreede, ache in the forhede, and sharp in walkyng. 
 
Forsoth if in the tymes of fleame, he shal be sike after the 
|P_197 
nature of his body and often white of colour with grete eyen 
and large and sumtyme like the eyen of hawkis, hevy eyeliddis, here 
crulled, hevy voice and grete, sleepith hevily and often stertith, in 
the mowth fleame haboundith, hevy in walkyng, many passiouns, moche 
cowgh, aufmerines, asmes, apostems, estropoms, colic, wil to vomyte 
or to cast, sumtyme the quartan, palasy, natural solucioun, and other 
whiche proceden of fleame. 
 
That if it be in tymes of blac coler, after it he is formed blac 
of colour and of chiere and in partie white, blac eyen and dry 
and sharp of sight, blac here, subtil of voice and nat high, often 
lawghyng for the milt, wherof procedith laughter, sharp in walkyng 
and nat hardy, passiouns of the quartan and sumtyme cotidian, 
mania, that is to say obliuioun or foryeteful of mynde, cardia, 
that is trouble of herte, nesropoma, that is ache in the reynes, palasy, 
stonyed and douteful of mynde, fantasies above maner, in al 
|P_199 
armonyes and melodies grete ache of bones to hym, whiche growen 
[\f. 32r\] of blac coler. Thiese thynges told bi philosophers to Galien whi 
chaungith nat the nature of other beestis bi the nombre of thiese 
tymes, houres, signes, and planetis so as the complexioun of man 
bi houres, tymes, signes, and planetis varieth. That so assoiled 
shortly for whi the body of mankynde is of veray necessite to be to the 
forsaide armonyes more swift, as lightly he levith alle, and the soule 
intendith fantasie. For whi as other beestis lackyng reason nat made 
ne lierned to suche myrthes, but only at mannes biddyng, nat in substaunce 
but in vertu of sapience and wisdam, wherof the soule of man, as 
in his reason goeth furth to the vniuersite, takyng the bodies of al for whi 
specialy in jmagynacioun, so therof parfite werkis of soule organs 
whiche is theoric and practik. For whi if hevy and vnresonable 
|P_201 
beestis were like to mannes complexioun, nat so certaynly were it, that 
is to say nat to so moche if certayne maner and tyme al thynges shuld be 
conceyved, neither so subtily al speculatiefs fantasies amytted. Therfor 
of so moche of his agilite he hath and of humours, whan he bigynneþ 
in the wombe of humours to transferre the propirtes of planetis and 
signes and to lotte the propirtes with variable workes. But the nature 
of vnresonable beestis is nat so chaunged after the nombre 
of houres and tymes ordeigned or the werkis of planetes and signes. 
But as the first of alle is made the propirte of alle bien of oon complexioun. 
For whi a beest what nombre is to hym colat or chosen, 
|P_203 
wherof as whan oon is made swift, anothe[{r{] slowe, oon is made litel, 
another is made grete, wherof this alonly bien alwey of the same 
complexioun. If forsoth thei folowen to the ful nombre of lettres, 
al other wise, other goeth bifore other, so as now other shewith 
fonnyshly, and so furth. But nat to so moche in hem prevailith þe 
nature of the sperme of hem as it tornyth that and fastenyth 
in the propirte of humours to whos tyme and houre thei bien deputed, 
but agenst the infirmyte or sike matier of their sperme drawith 
the half spryng and of the humours in their nature, for whi to 
|P_205 
so moche fix and inconuertible is the sperme of hem, of other either of 
theym al. But sumtyme it happith a partie to be chaunged that 
in al thynges is contrarie, for whi bitwene while to be agible and 
conuertible is, as the strength of houres and tymes and domynacion 
of humours preuailith to the sperme to that how to be chaunged. 
For whi and if in eueriche and synguler tymes al and eueriche humours 
shulde have domynioun in euery man as of hym alwey shal 
prevaile the strength of the humour in whiche humour he is born, 
but as of debilite or fiebilnes of the sperme sumtyme fallith as 
oon growith and thrivith in man the strength of the humour in þe 
[\f. 32v\] whiche tyme or houre he is born. 
 
Thei bien told of other philosophres to Porphiry how and 
in what maner in bodies substaunce other may be or to be 
|P_207 
or joyned in dedly substaunce, seyeng this to be fieble now to be faire 
that substaunce incorporat may be in dedly substaunce. Contrarie the 
whiche Porphirius seith, "A veray thyng and apt is what substaunce 
is in bodies in substaunce vndedly. But nat so as the iiij elementes 
bien joyned jn constitucioun or makyng of any other substaunce, 
but of soule spiritual with censible vertu of body, whiche bien the 
vertues of the body joyned with the word of God, and this cause is nat 
straunge to the cognicioun or knowlage to be the substaunce vncorporat 
to the humylite to the constitucioun of another substaunce, after whos 
|P_209 
complexioun that substaunces holden hemselven in their propirtes and 
differencis, alwey growyng bi hymsilf, that is to say to aduertise, 
and of his altitude never is accidental, folowyng to the altitude of his 
substaunce for whi he evene fulfillith, and of his difference distroieth 
euery and al accidental differently corporat or bodied, and non accidentals 
different may be ferme and stable in their substaunce." Thus seith 
Porphirius to the ostensioun of conjunccioun of the soule with the 
body, and bi this he confermyth that the word of God is in the substaunce 
of man. To this he schewith that Ysagogas hath made, in 
whiche he makith dyuersites or differences to be of soule stidefast 
and vnmortal and difference of body to be mortal. 
 
|P_211 
To the spermate spirite bien iij vertues, wherof the firste 
is necessite, the secunde is vertu. The thrid is organ. Necessite 
hath ij operaciouns, for whi it is to kepe heete and the norisshment 
of the lifly spirite. Vertu forsoth is the complement. Organ 
rennyth to al the operaciouns of the soule. Forsoth that spirite 
of whos organ he is accorded strecchith hymsilf bi arteries and 
veynes, yevyng in veynes the bloode to chaunge hymsilf the natural 
bloode and spiritual lyf. Fume forsoth goyng furth of heete of 
bloode is to norissh sperme, for whi fume spiritual sendith hymsilf 
to material veynes, beyng to anymacioun or soulyng of al the 
body and norisshyng, whiche a part turnyth into flessh, [\a part\] sendith 
|P_213 
out bi poores to the procreacioun of heris. Neither only it is fume 
of bloode, rather he hath the admyxture subtilite of spirit rennyng 
bi al the body. Bloode forsoth purged bi the lyver. Spirit forsoth in 
arterijs clarifieth of fume of heete to the hert comyng, of whos cliernesse 
a part shewith bi suche arterijs to the hede and entrailes, clarifieth 
[\f. 33r\] bi the heete above procedyng from the herte, and clarified goeth 
bi ij arteries in nervis whiche bien armonies in ventricules of the 
hede, vnto the soule, to whom of his grete subtilite connexith or byndiþ 
the soule, bi whiche the soule mynistrith his fantasy armony of al the 
body and tho armonyes bi hym to al the body. Bien saide armonyes of 
|P_215 
devictritijs and of many another for whi that spirit is corporat and 
he is the same soule with this reasoun for whi to mynistre fantasie 
censible and wit of the body cuttyng hymsilf in parties yevith to 
the body and of this accidental may be, for whi the armonyes of the hede 
in so moche neede, consumpt and wasted, drawith another spirite bi the 
same arterijs to the norisshment of the soule, for whi if he were substancial 
in hymsilf, it were no nede to drawe another. For whi bi this and 
|P_217 
that soule co[{r{]porat or bodied he werkith. Porphirius sum considerith 
nat the soule but considerith the lifly spirite racional. And therfor 
Porphirius hath compowned and made Ysagogas as bi theym shal be 
shewed that corporat spirite to be to thuse of the soule, nat the same 
soule. But Socrates, Plato, Aristotil, Theodorus, Platoniciens, 
Andronices, Perypaticis, Pophilijs, and many mo other of oon wil 
affermen that neither bodi is, neither bi lawe of place holdith, neither 
hymsilf seeth, for whi whan al the body with his vertu illumyneth to 
eueriche progresse withoutfurth, nat as in his substaunce suffrith any 
scisscioun, and so as the air illumyned of the sonne, so is the body of 
|P_219 
the soule, so as the aire evene berith the eyen of al thynges first jntelligence 
bi light of the sonne, so the soule the armony of the body and 
first and secunde intelligence bryngith evene bi spiritual light of 
his sapience. And so as the light of the sonne, whiche is vncorporat, 
fulfillyng his office suffrith no divisioun, so and the soule, whiche 
is vncorporate, departith without corrupcioun from the soule. Ginnomios 
the philosopher saith no wounder to be the soule, whiche is the 
substaunce in body, may be separat and departed from the body with 
fuyre, whiche is in vnder the bodies, may be departed from woode to 
|P_221 
whiche he is joyned and torne in his matier without corrupcioun of hym. 
So forsoth the soule, whiche is the substaunce vncorporate, 
may hymsilf suffre to be separat from the herte withoute his 
corrupcioun. Evene born in symilitude of soule to the symilitude 
of the sonne. So as the light of the sonne in al his lightis excersith 
his strength, nedith non other strength whiche he drawith as 
to the complement of his first vertu, so and the soule. Aristotil 
saith in Phisic to be v parties of the soule: phitic, that is to say 
stiptic, norisshyng, that is to say witte, quintic catatepen, that 
[\f. 33v\] is strength to go furth to euery place, oretic, that is to say reason. The 
|P_223 
soule, whiche whan he is greved of nature of the bodie, whan nature 
of his body goeth to the iiij elementis, that is suche part 
of the soule, therof to the substaunces of incamynaces as stones 
beren or bryngen or forsoth for the nutryment or norisshyng, that 
is to say therof to trees, from trees to beestis, from beestis to 
man, whan as to maner water devided in partis, whiche afterward 
|P_225 
bien reduced in man, whiche, if it be goode and pure, yieldith þe soule 
cliere in hevene. But Porphirius, nat consentyng to Aristotil, 
saith that non of thiese partes departith from the substaunce of 
soule, as other philosophers seyn, a newe soule in the most medlyng 
and associed to the sperme in the matrice or to be associed to þe chield 
formed in the matrice, wherof if it be evil, a man seeth in beest, 
therof yieldith to man water, if it be cliere, goeth into glorie [\or þrote\]. Porphirius 
shewith this maner nat to be don what of resonable soule 
may nat com from [\…\] into beest, from man into man, wherof in the 
hevene. It is to be wist that sperme nat alwey descendith 
animat from man in the matrice, but than in as moche whan it 
|P_227 
is constitute of God what ought to be gendred chield, so moche 
is the soule sociat to the sperme. Porphirius saith agenst þe 
Stoiciens the soules to be creat in euery man and put in the body first 
compowned in the matrice and al the bodie newe and temporatly 
creat to be dedly and shewith in this and the werk of God to be 
fieble, whan so as to be in euery day creat. But it is to be wist 
that forsoth sum han their lif stabil and stidefast from the 
bigynnyng, and so it is no neede to God to make euery houre and 
tyme newe thynges. 
 
Ipocras saith that if a womman receyve sperme in 
the first or the secunde houre of the yeere bi nyght or 
day, the chield of propirte shal be sanguyn. That if in iiij, 
v, or ij be conceived, shal reteign the propirte of rede coler. 
Tho forsoth houres bien his. That if in viij or ix be conceived, 
reteigneth the propirte of fleame. That if in x, xj, 
or xij hour of concepcioun, reteigneth the propir nature to 
whom. Ipocras seith that if the matrice of man take the 
sperme in the houres of sangwyne or in the houris of fleame 
|P_229 
or coler rede or coler blac, sum turnyth in the nature and propirte 
of tho houres and tymes. For whi if the nature of man have 
power to chaunge al the parties of the bodie into the nature 
of houres, so hath he power to chaunge sperme beyng in þe 
[\f. 34r\] matrice in the abovesaide nature, and therfor the chield reteigneþ 
the nature of bloode, for whi the sperme of the man received in the 
houres beyng of bloode. What if the concepcioun be of the chield 
in houris of sanguyn or bloode and the sperme of man in the houres 
of bloode, of fader and moder the concepcioun be in houris of coler, 
that is to say if the sperme be in the lift part, lieful the fader 
and moder bien conceived in houris of rede coler, as the infant may 
nat drawe to hym the figure of rede coler of the fader and moder 
for the coldnes of the lift part, hath his beyng passioun more of 
fleame or of blac coler as of rede coler, and tho passiouns ne bien 
nat so sharp as if it were in the right side, and lieful in that partie 
the strength be of blac coler, and for the coldenes of it therof be 
made the vertu of fleame so moche as the infant of bloode takith 
[\of\] the passioun the bigynnyng. If forsoth sperme be in the right side 
|P_231 
of the matrice, the chield forsoth be conceyved in the hour of sangwyn, 
the fader and moder in houres of blac coler, the more liefully he reteyneth 
the figure of fader and moder and of the nature of rede coler 
than of the nature of sanguyn, only he reteigneth the propre passioun 
from his bigynnyng, that is to say of bloode. Whiche passions 
bien thiese: pleuresis, spasme, aposteme, causon, and other suche 
maner passions he hath and of bloode acuicioun of rede coler. 
That if in the houris of sanguyn the fader and moder bien conceived, 
forsoth the chield be in the houris of rede coler, the chield forsoth shal 
reteigne the figure of sanguyne of fader and moder, more only than 
he shal reteigne the figure of rede coler, the propre passions of whiche 
he shal reteigne, whiche bien thiese: ffeuer tercian, sinochus, dissintery, 
arpomony, cephalargie, frenesy, ictericy, and suche other like. That 
if it fal in the lift partie and the sone or doughter be conceyved 
in the houres of blac coler, fader and moder in the houres of sangwyn, 
the doughter shal reteign more the figure of sanguyne of fader and 
moder than the figure of rede coler, for whi of the frigidite and cold 
of blac coler, whiche is in that partie, and of the cold of fleame tempereþ 
|P_233 
rede coler, the propirte only shal reteyne the passioun of rede coler, for 
why for the coldenes is lasse sharp than in the right side. That if concepcioun 
be in houris of blac coler, the fader and moder bien conceived 
in the same houris, and sperme be in the lift part, the mayden shal be 
malencolious naturaly, epilentic, paralitic and after that splenetic, 
quartanly, foolissh, dulle, shal be like to fader and moder, nor 
in any maner shal mow temper hir nature, whiche and thiese thynges 
toguyder suffrith. That if concepcioun be in thiese tymes of the 
[\f. 34v\] same houres and fader and moder bien conceived in the same so that the 
sperme be in the right side, for the nature of heete comyng from þe liver 
and the galle tempereth the nature of that chield, so sum nat alwey 
hath the passiouns abovesaide, and if he have, he hath hem temperate. 
It is to be wist that heete that he receivith from the lyver and galle 
is of accidental, therfor who that leesith nat the propirte of place that 
he hath of the houres of blac coler, whiche houres determynen bi course 
of planetis, and so as it is to vndirstonde of houres of rede coler and of 
al other what so they bien determyned bi cours of planetis. That if the 
doughter in the houres of blac coler, the fader forsoth and moder in þe houres 
|P_235 
of flewme, of the fader and moder so moche shal reteigne the figu[{r{]e of blac 
coler and from tho parties hath the propirtes of passiouns. That if in the 
right side the sperme and fader and moder conceived in the houris of fleame, 
so the chield shal reteigne the figure of blac coler, the figure only of 
sanguyne more reteyneth of fader and moder of fleame temperat, but 
the propirte of passiouns reteigneth of blac coler, whiche passions bien 
nat so sharpe. That if the concepcioun be in the houres of fleame, 
of fader and moder and the concepcioun toguyder so that the sperme 
be in the lift side, the womman shal be flewmatic and fieble of nature 
and suffre cotidian, lienterie, cephalargie, armopome, that is ache 
of al the membris, netropomy, that is ache of the jlijs, calopotomye, 
that is ache of the matrice, and many other passiouns hath and part of 
the passioun comyng of blac coler for the affynite of fleame. That if 
concepcioun be in the houres of fleame in the right side, the chield shal 
suffre of the same passiouns, but temperatly for the sanguyn of rede coler. 
That if fader and moder bien conceived in houres of fleame, the mayde 
forsoth in the houris of sangwyn, of nature of fader and moder shal have 
|P_237 
the nature and passioun of fleame, but nat only tho passiouns mown 
bien sharp in hir for the more propirte that she hath of sanguyne. That 
if of fader and moder the concepcioun in houres of sanguyn, the mayde 
biforsaide in houres of fleame, hath the propirte of sanguyn of fader and 
moder and of rede coler equaly, but the more propirte of passioun hath 
of fleame, whiche passiouns bien tempered bi bloode. That if the concepcioun 
be in houres of sanguyn, of the fader forsoth in the houres of fleame, 
the moder in the houres of blac coler, shal reteigne part of the figure of 
the fader, forsoth of the figure of the moder nothyng, but the debilite and 
fiebilnes and inhereys of the moders part shal have, of bloode forsoth he 
shal have the principal figure and passioun. That if the concepcioun 
be in the houres abovesaide in the lift partie, of the moder side cometh the 
more part of figure, bloode and equalite of figure reteigneth of fader 
[\f. 35r\] and moder, but the propirte of passiouns he hath so moche of bloode, for why 
for the coldnes of the lift partie bien nat so sharp as tho whiche bien in the 
right partie. For whi if a chield be conceived in the houres of blac coler but the 
more part of passioun he hath of rede coler, forsoth the lesse part he hath 
accidently of bloode and blac coler, wherfor the passiouns bien sumwhat 
|P_239 
temperat. That if concepcioun be in the lift partie in the houres 
abovesaide, the womman shal reteigne the more part of blac coler, the 
lasse part of fader, and moder no, propirte of passioun hath of blac coler, 
whiche bien sharp. That if concepcioun of a chield and of the fader 
shal be in houres of rede coler, concepcioun of the moder in houres of 
fleame or sanguyne, the more part shal reteigne the figure of 
the fader, to coler forsoth rede meane, to the moder lesse, passioun of rede 
coler. That if concepcioun be in lift part in the houres abovesaide, 
equaly shal have figure of fader and moder, but litel of rede coler, þe 
whiche bien comparate. That if concepcioun be in the right side in the 
houres of fleame, of the fader forsoth [\and\] of the moder in the houres of sanguyn, 
the more part figure he shal have of the fader, the meane of the moder, þe 
lesse of fleame, passiouns of fleame and sanguyn. That if concepcioun 
be in the lift part, the more part of figure shal be had of blac coler 
and fleame, lesse of the moder, and of the fader nothyng, passiouns of 
fleame and blac coler. That if concepcioun shal be in the houres of sanguyn, 
|P_241 
shal have the figure of the fader. And if the sperme of the fader 
habounde over and be sanguyne, than of the partie of the fader shal be 
al the figure, passiouns of sanguyne sharp. That if concepcioun of 
al be in the houres abovesaide in the lift partie and the sperme of the 
moder be fieble, so the doughter shal reteigne the more figure of the 
moder, the lasse of blac coler. That if sperme of the moder be fieble, 
of the fader forsoth holle and strong, al the figure shal be had of 
the fader, the fiebilnes of the body of the moder, to the passiouns of 
sanguyne, part of blac coler accidently. That if concepcioun of 
al shal be in houres of sanguyn coler rede and the sperme of the fader 
shal be fieble, evenely of theym both shal receive the figure, sumwhat 
only he shal have of rede coler. That if thei bien equal and holle, of 
both he receivith [\al\] the figure the infant shal have of rede coler and 
sharp passiouns. That if concepcioun in the houres abovesaide be 
in the lift partie and eithers sperme fieble bien, the part of the figure 
shal have of blac coler, and as moche he hath [\of both\] and passiouns of rede coler. 
|P_243 
That if sperme of the fader be holle and the sperme of the moder fiebil, 
[\f. 35v\] the figure shal have part of the fader, of the moder forsoth but a 
litel. That if sperme of the moder be holle and of the fader fieble, 
the figure shal have parte of the moder and a parte of the fader. And if 
the sperme of the moder overhabounde, the figure shal have the more 
part of the mode[{r{]. That if concepcioun of al shal be in the houres 
of fleame and both spermes bien holle, the figure shal have þe more 
part of the fader, the lasse of the moder. That if the spe[{r{]me of the 
moder be fieble and of the fader strong, a litel he shal have of þe moder 
and more of the fader. That if the sperme of the fader be fieble and of 
the moder strong, the figure shal reteigne equaly of both. That if 
both bien fieble, al the figure shal have of fleame, a litel of sanguyn 
and rede coler for the right side, passiouns of fleame and accidently of 
sanguyn and rede coler. That if it be in the synistre or lift partie in 
the placis abovesaide and either sperme be fieble, litel shal he have 
of both, that is to say of blac coler he shal have more than of fleame 
|P_245 
for the coldnes of that oon partie. That if thei bien equal and 
sanguyn, the figure shal reteigne of both equaly, a litel forsoth to 
blac coler and accidently. That if spermes habounde and bien holle, the 
more shal he have of the fader than of the moder. That if concepcioun 
of al shal be in the houres of blac coler and eithers sperm bi fieble, of 
both the figure shal receive a litel, more forsoth of blac coler, sumwhat 
of rede coler accidently. If forsoth sanguyn be made, of both 
the figure shal reteigne and a litel of blac coler and of rede coler 
accidently. That if the sperme of the moder overhabounde, more 
the figure of the moder. And if the sperme of the fader overhabonde, 
the more he shal have of the fader and passiouns of blac 
coler. That if thei bien both holle, the figure shal reteigne of both, but 
more of the moder and lasse of the fader. And if the sperme of the 
moder be fieble and of the fader holle, equaly of both the figure 
shal reteigne and of blac coler more. That if the sperme of the 
moder overhabounde the sperme of the fader, more he shal have of the 
moder and a litel of the fader, forsoth more passioun of blac coler and 
|P_247 
lasse of fleam[{e{]. If the sperme of al bien in the matrice, of the fader of 
theym the[{i{] shuln bien of grete eloquens. If fader of a chield and vncle 
or of that chield and of his fader bien conceived in houres of 
sanguyne, the moder forsoth of the chield in the houres of fleame, 
and the sperme of that moder overhaboundith the sperme of 
the fader, so only that it be fieble, so the infant shal nat drawe 
the figure of the fader, for whi his sperme is overcome of the 
sperme of the moder, neither of the moder, for hir sperme is 
fieble. Whan forsoth the chield hath the bigynnyng of 
houris sanguyne so as the vncle of hym, reteigneth the figure 
[\f. 36r\] from hym. If the fader shede his seede in the houris of sanguyn and the 
moder be conceived in the same houres, of whos sperme be strenger 
and holer, be the sperme of the man fieble, the chield may nat reteigne 
the figure of the fader for the fiebilnes of his sperme. If forsoth 
the sperme of the moder be strenger than the sperme of the man hir 
propirte, but afterward overcomyng sum other passioun outher of fleame 
or of blac coler or sum other fiebil humour, now the chield may nat reteigne 
|P_249 
the figure of the moder, and for whi the aunte of that chielde 
is conceived in the houre of sanguyne, so and as the chield, of whom 
the sperme reducith the sperme of his moder to his nature. That 
sperme, that is the wey of the chield sharpyng hymsilf in the 
vij day, may nat come in the figure of fader and moder, for thiese 
abovesaide passiouns comen in the figure of the soule. If forsoth 
the sperme of the vncle be strengger than the sperme of the aunte, 
so shal the chield hold and reteigne the figure from the vncle, if it be 
conceived in the same houres. Now the chield, beyng in the iij 
place from his vncle or from his aunte, hath help of his figure 
and nat of fader or moder, beyng in the secunde place, so for whi 
the sperme alwey hath be fieble, so for whi the werkis of the planetis 
wont to mynister the prosperite after vnevene nombre to 
aduersite after evene nombre. If forsoth both spermes be of sanguyne 
in the secunde place, it lettith nat what the chield receive 
the figure of fader or mode[{r{] and his propirte receivith of the houres 
in the whiche he is conceived, but his effect takith of the nature 
of planetis and whiche or sum is gramatic or dialotic, etc. 
|P_251 
If forsoth the spermes of fader and moder hath bien fieble, þan 
neither houre nor the secunde place shuln lette what he receyve 
the figure of vncle or of aunte, and that be don for the nature 
of the thrid place and for the natures of the same houres in þe 
whiche thei bien conceived. It happith bifore and sumtyme 
that the doughter is nat like non of hir parentis, and that is 
for the nature of the planetis. Sumtyme a chield is born dum, 
without feete, without hede, without eyen, without heryng, etc. 
And therof I promitte me and afferme to yield reason, witnesse 
of Ipocras, that of al the substaunces of animate or souled bodies 
bien ligat, bounden, and joyned in planetis and signes, nexed 
to the iiij elementis, and this to prove bi auctorite of Alisaundre, 
|P_253 
Emperour of Macedonye, so seyeng tha[{t{] Nectanabus his fader and 
after the werkis or nature of planetis, whan he lay with his 
moder Olimpiade, bi his mathematic magic and astronomye 
[\f. 36v\] wold nat suffre hir to chield but in suche houre in which he wold nat 
hym to reteigne the figure of fader or moder but of the operacioun of þe 
planetis and signes. He considred the sonne com into Lyoun and 
Saturne into the Boole, of whom he wold his sone to be born 
and figure and nature principaly to be reteigne than of any other 
signes and planetis, as the thyng afterward evene preved. Of 
the Lyoun forsoth he hield crisp of heris and cit[{r{]yne colour and 
froward aspect or looke, wrathful face, and of moche strength. And 
for whi the egle reteigneth the propirte of the Lyoun in that only that 
the egle flieth hier than any other brid and sharper of sight, so 
had Alisaunder of his signe and egles eye and nose in maner of an 
egle, and for whi the sonne hath his cliernes above al other planetes, 
|P_255 
of the propirte of the sonne so beyng in the Lyoun, in his nativite 
he had domy[{ni{]oun and lordship vpon al the world. Of nature forsoþ 
of the Boole reteigned froward frunt or forhede and the werke of 
highnes and ferocite or woodenes. Forsoth it is of the boole to tily 
therth with grete ingeny and wit and simpilnes of faire werke, 
and for whi the dragon hath propirte in the signe of the Boole and 
in gretnes and in witte, so had Alisaunder of the dragon sharp teeþ 
and anothe[{r{] eye like to the dragon. And so as Saturnus is highest 
of al planetis and with humydit[{e{] and subtilite differencith and overcometh 
al the werkis of other planetis, so Alisaunder had the highnes 
of werke above al men.
