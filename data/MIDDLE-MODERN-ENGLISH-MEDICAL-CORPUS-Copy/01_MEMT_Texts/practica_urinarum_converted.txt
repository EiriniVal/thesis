[\f. 14r\] It is vndirstonde who-so will loke an vrine hym behouyth to considre 
three thynges. Ffirst, he must aske the age of the pacient and hou long 
his seknes hath holden hym, and what tyme it toke hym first, and which 
tyme of the day or of the nyght it greuyth hym most. Also yif the vrine 
were made & brought in a clene vessell and that it were the first watir 
aftir mydnyght. Also þe dyete of the pacient, whethir he hath vsid high 
metis and drynkis or els lowgh. Also it [\f. 14v\] behoovith to considir 
the substaunce of the vryne, whethir it be thik or els thyn; and the qualite, 
wheithir it bee high or lowgh of colour; and the quantite, wheithir it be 
litill or muche; and the contentis and the clowdis that be therein, and 
in which region they be in, and yif the[{y{] be ovirall in-liche colourd, or 
yif it be more remisse in oon region than in anothir; or yif it be of too 
colours or yif it [{be{] ouirall inliche colourid, both intencion & remission. 
 
Than it behoovith principally to wit by consideracion of the vryne 
and by askyng also what the maladie is, wheþir [\f. 15r\] it bee a feuere 
or an-othir maladie, whethir it be also in the begynnyng or in the endyng 
or els in statu. 
 
Also, when thou hast vndirstande all this and the vryne of the pacient 
is brought to the, thou must considir thre thynges in euery vryne, 
that is to sey the substaunce, the colour, & sedimen. One is cause of colour; 
a-nothir is cause of substaunce; the thrid is cause of sedimen. 
 
Nowe in euery mannys body is iiij qualitees: hote & colde, moyste 
& drye. Hete & colde, the[{y{] are causers of colours. Drynesse and [\f. 15v\] 
moistnesse, they bee cause of substaunce. Hete is the cause of red 
coloure. Colde is the cause of white coloure. Drynesse is cause of thyn 
substaunce. Moistnesse is cause of thik substaunce. 
 
As þus yif the vryne of the pacient be red & thik, it signifieth that 
blode hath more dominacion than anothir; why? for blode is hote & 
moyste. 
 
Yif it be red & thyn, it shewith þat colere hath dominacion, for why 
coler is hote & drye. 
|P_180 
Yif the vryne apere white & thik, it betokenyth flewme, for flewme 
is colde & moiste. 
 
Yif the vryne shewe white & thyn, it signifieth malencolie, for malencolie 
is colde & [\f. 16r\] dry. 
 
Whan thou hast considird all this tofore, I shall shewe the vryns & 
the colours by picture. Deo gracias. Qd. B. R.
