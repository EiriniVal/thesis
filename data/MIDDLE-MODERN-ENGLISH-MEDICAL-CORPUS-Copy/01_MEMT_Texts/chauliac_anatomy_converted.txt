[\f. 16a\] Þe selfe hert is bounden with þe pulmon, & it is sustened & festned bi 
mediastinum, Of which it is shewed þat it haþ colligaunce with al 
membre3. Also it sheweþ þat it is of so grete dignitee þat it may no3t 
longe tyme sustene passions. 
 
Aboue þe selfe hert weyves þe pulmon for to refresh it, of which þe 
substaunce is. softe. þynne. spongious. & white; with-in which ar 
insered .i. implanted .3. kyndes of vessele3 .s. þe braunche of þe vene 
arterialis, which, as it is said, springeþ of þe ri3t uentricle of þe herte, 
And þe braunche of arterie uenalis, þat comeþ from þe lefte uentricle. 
And with þise þe braunche3 of trachea arteria, bringing to it aier for 
þe hert. which uesselle3 forsoþ bene diuided bi alle þe pulmon to þe 
most litel partie3. 
 
Þe pulmon forsoþ haþ .5 lobos or pennes: 2. in þe lefte partie & 3. 
forsoþ in þe ri3t partie. Bihynde þe pulmon toward þe 5a. spondile passeþ 
mery or ysophagus, of which it is seid aboue. And also þer passeþ an 
holowe veyne ascendyng, of which it shal be seid with-in, boþe passyng 
bi diafragma. 
 
And also þer passeþ þe arterie aborchi, ascendyng fro þe hert. And 
al þise with trachea makeþ a stok, replete vn-to þe gulet with pannicle3 & 
strong ligamente3 & glandelous flesh. 
 
Sewyngly in þe brest bene .3. pannicle3. ffirst is a pannicle which 
fro with-infourþ couereþ al þe rybbes, which is seid pleura. 
 
Þe 2. is mediastinum, which diuideþ al þe clibane in-to þe ri3t part & 
to þe lefte. 
 
Þe 3. is diafragma, which diuideþ alle þe spirituale3 [\f. 16b\] fro þe nutriue3. 
And it is componed of pleura & of ciphac & þe cordose pannicle, sprongen 
on þe middes, & of nerues, sent vn-to hym fro þe spondile3, & of 
carnose flesh most biside þe ribbe3. Of which it is shewed þat [{it{] is a 
muscle whos operacioun is to brething, And his iuuament to expulsioun 
of superflwitees, as G seiþ. 
 
[}Off anathomye of þe wombe & of the parties of it. Capitulum Sextum.}]
|P_116 
The wombe is equiuocate to .2. þinge3 as now present here. ffirst 
it is taken for þat. þat arabic translacioun calleþ þe stomac. 
 
þe stomac forsoþ in grec translacioun is seid mery or ysophagus. 
In arabic forsoþ stomac is seid þe wombe. In þe second it is take forsoþ 
for al þe region of nutriue3 membres, & so it is take here. 
 
Aboute þe wombe inquire we in folowing Mundine þo .9. þinges 
which beþ inquired in oþer membre3. ffirst of þe posicioun & of þe site 
of it generale & totale it is sene þat is is vnder þe regioun of spirituale 
membres. 
 
Of particuler posicioun & site it is sene þat þe orificiale party, which 
olde men called precordiale, is to-ward þe forcelle. þe stomocal partie is 
fro þens vn-to .3. fyngers ny3 þe vmbilic .i. nauelle. 
 
The vmbelic partie & sumeniale is fro þe vmbelic donward. 
 
Þe Ipocundrie3 bene on þe sides vnder þe ribbes. 
 
Þe ylie3 forsoþ aboue þe haunches. The nombre of þe partie3 of þe 
wombe & þe anathomye of it may no3t wele be sene but if þe wombe, as it 
seide aboue, bene opned after long & ouerthwert. 
 
And it þus opned, be þer considered þe partie3 of it contenyng & 
contened. 
 
Parties contenyng on þe forþer partie bene Mirac. & ciphac. On þe 
hynder partie þe .5. spondile3 of þe reyne3 And þe flesh vnder-put to 
þam. 
 
Mirac realy is componed of .4. partie3 .s. of fatnes, of þe skyn, & of a 
carnose pannicle, & of muscle3, fro which procedith corde3. 
 
Ciphac is no3t but one pannicle fro with-infourþ cleuyng to þe selfe 
mirac. Of which sheweþ þe difference of Mirac & of ciphac. 
 
Partie3 contened bene .7; first is 3irbus, afterward þe entrale3, 
After þe stomac, þe lyuer, þe splene, þe mesentarie, & þe reyne3, ffor 
þe vesic & þe matrix shal be seid in þe anathomie of þe haunche3. 
Of which it is to sewe bi ordre. And first it is knowen anence al men of 
þe skyn, of þe fatnes, & of þe carnose pannicle. 
 
Muscle3 bene made in þe wombe for to strengþ it. And with þat þai 
help oþer membre3 to þair superfluitee3 to be put oute. And after G 
|P_118 
4=o=. de utilitate & 6=o= cerapeutice þer bene .8. in nombre vi3 .2. longitudinale3,

of þe wombe at ri3t angle3. 
 
4. transuersale, of þe which .2. springeþ at þe costes .i. ribbes of þe 
ri3t side & goþ to þe lefte side of þe bone3 of þe haunches & of pecten, 
And oþer 2. at þe lefte costes to þe ri3t partie of þe sidebones, crossyng 
by þe myddes of þe wombe to þe fourme of þe lettre .X. 
 
Þise muscules raised vp & kut a-way, þer appereþ ciphac. which of G 
is seyd peritoneum, of pery. þat is aboute & tendo þat is to goo, As it 
war goyng aboute. which is a pannicle, neruous, subtile & hard, ordeynd 
to þat þat it defende þat þe muscule3 compresse no3t þe naturale membr3, 
& þat it be no3t li3tly brusten & þe þinge3 contened gone oute, as it 
falleþ in þam þat bene brusten. And þat it shulde bynd þe entrelle3, 
And þat it shulde helpe membre3 to put out þinges to be put out. And 
þus is shewed te disposicion of þe contenyng partie3 of þe selfe wombe. 
 
Of which is shewed þat G seid in .6=o= cerapeutice þat wlneracions & 
suycions bene more perilous & more hard about þe myddes of þe wombe 
þan about þe sides, ffor þo partie3 bene more tractable & more eductible 
of þe entrale3 þan oþer partie3. 
 
Also it is shewed þat in woundes persyng þe wombe þer shal no3t be 
made gode incarnacioun bot if þat cifac be sewed with myrac. 
 
Þise y-seye, it is to go to þe partie3 contened with-yn þe wombe, wher 
first comeþ to 3irbus. þat of G is seid omentum or epiglonun of epy [\f. 17a\] 
þat is aboue & plenon þat is to shewe out, as it were shewing out 
aboue al; which is a pannicle, inuoluyng & coueryng þe stomac & þe entrele3, 
of 2. dense tunicle3 & subtile, vnderput to þam selfe to-gider, with 
many forsoþ arterie3 & veyne3 & no3t a litel fatnes about þe coste3, 
ordeynd for to hete or chaufe þe forsaid membre3 in 4=o=.de vtilitate capitulo 
14=o=; Of which þe springyng is at þe partie3 which bene after þe backe 
of þe selfe peritonei .i. ciphac. Of which it is shewed þat, when þe forsaid 
particle goþ oute in þe woundes of þe wombe, þat it is li3tly alterate for 
þe fatnes; And þat it is to be bounden & no3t to be kutte, dredyng þe 
emorosogie after G in cerapeutica loco prealligato. 
|P_120 
After forsop for þat þe entrele3 letteþ þe vision of þe anathomie of 
oþer membre3, it is to be seid of þam. 
 
Entrale3 forsoþ bene vessele3 made with .2. tunicle3 to parfourme 
þe first digestioun And for to anadise i. for to giffe chile to þe lyuer 
hem selfe, þe veyne3 miseraices beyng mene, & ordeynd for to put out 
þe feci superfluitee. 
 
Þe nombre of entrele3 is 6.; þof al þei bene al continued, Neþerle3, 
þai haue alle diuerse fourmes & offices bi which þai bene distingued. 
vi3. 3. smal & also many grosse, The nombre of which is put of G 4=o=. 
de utilitate capitulo. 26=o=. ffirst forsoþ with-in þe wombe is fisis .i. portanarie 
or duodenum. 
 
Þe .2. is ieiunum, .3. subtile, .4. cecum, .5. colon, 6. rectum. In 
which after þe ende bene muscule3, which gouerneþ þe superfluitee3. 
 
And þat þe anathomie be better sene, it is to bigynne at þe last entrele, 
which is called rectum or longaon. And þat þe fece3 let no3t, be it 
bounden toward þe vpper partie in .2. place3, And be it kut in þe middes 
of ligature, And be þe lower partie lefte, And be it proceded in discarnand 
vnto biside þe Ilie3 wher þe entrele colon bigynneþ, which is grosse, 
cellulate, in which þe fece3 resceyue þaire fourme. And it haþ in lengþ 
wele .2. armlong. And it declyneþ mych toward þe lefte reyne. And in 
ascendang toward þe splene, it reuolueþ it selfe at the forþer party at 
þe ri3t side of þe stomac vnder þe 3. penule of þe lyuer, where it resceyueþ 
a porcion of colre, which exiteþ it to put out. 
 
And in reuoluyng it descendeþ to þe ri3t reyne to þe terme .i. ende of 
þe haunche. where bigynneþ monoculus or cecus, for it semeþ for to 
haue but one hole, þof al it haue .2. ri3t nere to-gider; bi þe tone goþ 
in þe mater, & bi þe toþer it goþ out. 
 
It is called also saccus to þe maner of þe stomac siþ it is the toþer 
stomac. And it is short of a gode palme; And for þe ny3nes þat it 
haþ to þe inguyne3, And for þat is is no3t wele bounden, in crepature3 
more redely it descendeþ doun in-to osseum After Auicen. 
 
And fro it springeþ ylion, which is a smal entrale .long. wele of .7. or .8. 
armelengþ. And it is reuolued mych aboute þe ilie3 & þe backe. 

|P_122 
Afterward þou shale fynde þe entrale ieiunum, & it is named so of 
þe voidenes þat is made of te multitude of þe miseraices & of þe porcion 
of þe colre ysent a-tuix it & þe portanarie, To which is contenued 
duodenum. for þe lengþ of it is of 12. fyngere3. And also it is called of 
þe office. for it is þe nyþer porte .i. 3ate of þe stomac as mery is þe vpper. 
 
Of which ye may se in þe passions of þe entrale3 þe inuencioun .i. 
fyndyng of clistere3 & place3 wher remedie3 owe to be applicate. ffor in 
colica in þe forþer partie & aboute þe ri3t parte & þe lefte, In yliaca 
aboute þe sides. And also þat þe woundes of þe smal entrale3 be no3t 
cured for þai ar more panniculose; þa[{i{] of þe grosse or somtyme 
[{for{] þai ar more carnose. And þat þu see better oþer þinge3, it is 
gode for to bynd toward þe portanarie and for to kitte as þou dide aboue. 
And be þe entrale3 drawen out. 
 
And see first, if þu wil, mesentarium, which is no3t els þan a texture of 
innumerable veyne3 miseraices, ramified of o veyne seid porta epatis 
to þe entrale3, And couvered & defended of pannicle3 & ligamente3, 
conioynyng þe entrale3 with þe backe, ful of fatnes & glandelous flesh, 
seid comonly rodol, which þu shalt see separately fro þe entrale3. 
[\f. 17b\] And þat i-cast out, se þow þe anathomie of þe stomac. 
 
Þe stomac or þe wombe is þe organ of þe first digestion generatif 
of chily. 
 
Wherof as þe miseraices bene preperatorie3 of digestion of the 
chime of the lyuer, So the mouth of the stomac is preparatorie of digestioun 
of chile. wherfor seiþ Auicen; norishing in masticacion haþ 
som digestion to which deserueþ mery or ysophagus to þe vpper partie 
for to bringe mete3 to þe same. And þe entrale3 with þe miseraices for to 
put out noieous þinges And for to distribue profitable þinges, digest and 
chilosated in it. 
 
It is forsoþ as a promtuari or seler or spense comon of al particle3, 
sette in þe middes of a beest, after G. 4=o= de utilitate Capitulo primo 
And þof al it be set in þe middes vnder þe breste or thorax, Neþerle3, þe 
vppermore partie of it declyneþ a litel to þe lefte side toward þe 12. 
spondile wher diafragma is termined, þe lowar partie forsoþ toward þe 
ri3te side. 

|P_124 
Þe acte of þe stomac forsoþ is for to dygeste bi þe hete of his owne 
carnositee of his grounde .i. bothme, As seid Auicen, And bi oþer hetes 
geten bi his nei3bours. It haþ forsoþ þe lyuer of þe ri3t side. chaufing 
hym as aboue with his lobe3 or his fyngers, And þe splene of þe lefte 
side with his fatnes & veyne3, sendyng to hym with þat malincolie for to 
excite his appetite. 
 
And aboue, þe hert, quikyng hym with his arterie3, And þe brayne, 
sendyng to hym a braunch of nerue3 toward þe vpper partie for to fele. 
 
Also it haþ, descendyng downe of þe partie of þe backe, þe veyne3 
Kylym & aborchy And many ligament3 with which it is bounden to þe 
spondile3 of þe reyne3. 
 
And þus is shewed þe acte, þe posicion, & þe colligance of it. 
 
The nombre forsoþ of þe partie3 of it, as it was seid of mery, is of 2. 
tunicles, .vi3. carnous fro with-outforþ, neruous fro with-inforþ; with 
villes forsoþ longitudinale3 for to drawe or make attraccioun, with 
transuersale3 forto withholde or make retencioun, latitudinale3 for 
to put out or make expulsion. 
 
Þe fourme of it & þe figure is rounde, euenlonge to þe maner of a 
cucurbite y-croked; in crokyng, so þat þe holes yseid bene þe more 
hi3e partie3 of þe bodi of it, And þat. þat þer bene no3t done vnauised 
goyng out of þinges contened. 
 
Þe opne quantite of hym comonly haldeþ .2 or 3. pyncherie3 of 
wyne. It may thole or suffre many passiones. 
 
In curacion we bene holpen by þe anathomie. ffor remedies to þe 
vpper partie may helpe fro þe partie of þe .12. spondile, And of þe 
forþermore party fro þe forcelle nerehand to þe vmbilic. Sewingli it 
is to be seid of þe lyuer. þe Lyuer is þe organe of þe second digestioun 
generatiue of blode, sette vnder þe false coste3 in þe ri3t side. 
 
It has fourme of þe mone, gibbus toward the coste3, holowe toward 
þe stomac, with .5. lobe3 or penule3 to þe maner of a hand aboue comprehendyng 
þe stomac. 
 
Þe lyuer haþ as oþer entrale3 a pannicle couering hym, to which bi 
cause of feling comeþ a litel nerue. 
 
Þe selfe lyuer with his pellicle is bounden with diafragma, And bi 
sewing with þam aboue wiþ strong ligamente3, And with þe backe & 
|P_126 
stomac & entrale3. & it haþ colligance with þam & with þe hert & 
with þe reyne3 & also with þe testicles & oþer membre3. 
 
Þe substaunce of þe lyuer is rede carnous, as if it war coagulate 
blode, implanted þorgh alle of veyne3 & of arteries, as it shal be seide. 
 
Þe lyuer forsoþ þof al it be componed of many þynge3, Neþerle3 it 
haþ one symple particle .vi3. flesh, bi which it is bigynny[{n{]g of blodyng 
& of veynes; ffor-whi after þat G seiþ in 2=o=. de uirtutibus naturalibus 
capitulo vltimo Et in .4=o=. de utilitates capitulo 5=o=.: As of muske in vegitee 
.i. a maner vessel bi boilyng bene made .3. substance, So of 
chile in þe lyuer bi decoccion be made .3. substaunce .s. 2. superfluitee3 & 
a naturale substaunce with aquosite comon to oþer humours, by oure 
comon scole seid massa sanguinaria, contenyng in yt selfe .4. substaunce3 
naturale & nutrimentale; And is shewed completly in 2=o=. de elementis. 
 
Þise humours forsoþ, which [\f. 18a\] bene engendred of chile in þe lyuer, 
as it is seid, bene double. Som bene naturale, seid of naturalitee of 
nutricion, Som no3t naturale. Naturale3 with þe blode bene send to al 
þe body to be engendred & noreshed. No3t naturale3 bene sequestrate & 
sent to place3 ordeyned for som helpynge3, Or þai bene sent & put out 
fro þe body as colre to þe chest of þe galle3, Melancolie to þe splene, 
fleume to þe iuncture3, þe watery superfluitee to þe reyne3 & to þe uesic. 
 
Þai bene put out fro þe body & þai goo with þe blode. And somtyme 
þai putrefie & make febre3. Som bene put out to þe skyn or bene resolued 
vnsensibly or sencibly by swet or bi scabbe or bi pusculacions 
or apostemacions. 
 
Þerfor þer bene .4 humours naturale & 4 no3t naturale & aquosite, þe 
which olde men named Bloode, ffleume. Colre. Malencolie. The which, 
y-gendred in þe lyuer, bene distribute bi þis maner: 
 
ffro þe concauitee of þe lyuer gooþ oute a veyne seid porta. which, 
partied in vnnumerable veynes miseraices, implicate in þe stomac & in 
þe entrale3, drawith & bereþ al þe succosite of chily to þe lyuer. 
 
And it with his rotes distribuyþ it þor3 al þe lyuer. 
 
ffro þe gibbosite forsoþ of þe same lyuer goþ out a veyne seid concaua, 
or Kylys, which also with his rotes metyng to þe oþer draweþ out fro 
|P_128 
al þe lyuer þe blode engendred in it. And it in ramifiyng vpward & 
dounward, as it was seid aboue, distribueþ & bereþ þat blode to al þe 
body to be noreshed, where is p[{er{]fetly done þe digestioun þe .3. & 
þe .4. 
 
Also fro þe selfe lyuer goþ oute propre weyes & colatorie3. beryng þe 
superfluitee3 of þe forsaid digestioun to þair propre places, which 
shal be seid. Of which is shewed þe acte, þe posicioun, þe substaunce, 
þe colligance, & oþer þinge3, which bene inquired in þe lyuer as in 
oþer membre3. 
 
It is ouer for to sey of þe sikene3 þe lyuer after þat ye seen may suffre 
many sikene3, of which his sanguinacioun is hurt which is þe propre acte 
of it. And þer is made cachochimia i. yuel chyme & ydropesis. Wher 
þe ydropisis is errour of þe digestyue in þe lyuer after G in de uirtutibus 
Et 6=o=, de egritudine & sinthomate. 
 
Þerfor it semeþ of þinges isaid þat medecene of þe lyuer owe to be 
applicate in þe ri3t side, And for þe substance of it It oweþ for to stipticite. 
 
After þe anathomie of þe lyuer it is to be seid of þe particule3 to þe 
which bene sent þe superfluytes gendred in it, as it is nowe seid. And 
first of þe chiste of þe gall. 
 
Chest of þe galle is a purse or a pannicler vesic, sette in þe Concauitee 
of þe lyuer about þe myddes penule or lobe, ordeynd to receyue þe colric 
superfluitee which is y-gendred in it. which purse forsoþ haþ 2. hole3 or 
necke3 oned to-gider at som litel distaunce after Mundyne. 
 
Þe tone is direct toward þe myddes of Þe lyuer for to resceyue þe colre. 
 
Þe toþer to þe ground of þe stomac & to þe entrale3 for to clense 
and put out colre to þam for þair utilitee3. Of which may be sene þe 
site & þe place, þe acte & þe substance, þe fourme, þe partie3 & þe 
colligance, & þe quantite. And þat þat is contened in it perauenture 
holdeþ a glas fulle. 
 
3e may consider also þat it may suffre opilacions boþ in þe comon necke 
& in þe owne proprietee3. 
 
When in þe comon necke, þen colre is no3t drawen to ne put out, but 
it abideþ with þe blode & citrineþ þe vrine & al þe body. When in 
his owne proprietee3, þe iuuamente3 which he doþ in þo membre3 to 
|P_130 
which it was sent, defaileþ, & it engendreþ yuel accidente3 after G .6=o=. de 
egritudine & sinthomate & 5=o= interiorum. 
 
Þe splene is receptorie of melancolious superfluitee gendred in þe 
lyuer, Ordeyned in þe lefte partie, transuersly halsing þe stomac, þe 
substance of wham is rara .i. þyn, spongious, more blac þen of þe lyuer. 
It haþ an euelong figure, as it were quadrangulere; & it is bounden by 
his pannycle with þe coste3 after hys gibbositee, And after his concauitee 
with [\f. 18b\] þe selfe stomac & with 3irbo. 
 
Þe splene haþ 2. waies. Bi þe tone it draweþ the superfluite seid fro 
þe lyuer. Bi þat oþer it sendeþ it to þe stomac for þe iuuamente3 y-said. 
 
Þe splene may suffre many sikenes, most redely hardnes & opilacions 
for þe mater yseyd, þat if of þise he suffre defect of mundifying þe 
lyuer, þe body is made þynne .i. lene & discolorate; If defect of sending 
to þe stomac, þe appetite is hurte, as þise þinge3 bene radde ubi supra. 
 
Solucions of continuyte bene no3t so perilous in it as in þe lyuer. 
Splene suffreþ more strong medecene3 þan doþ þe lyuer. 
 
It is properly purged bi þe wombe. 
 
It is medicyned aboute þe lefte place as G seiþ 13=o=. cerapeutice. þe 
reyne3 bene particle3 ordeynd for to mundifye þe blode fro þe aquous

Þer comeþ to þe reyne3. veynes & arterie3 & nerue3, of which þe 
pannicle of þam is ymade. 
 
Þe Reyne3 be bounden with þe backe. 
 
Þe Reyne3 haþ talowy fatnes on euery side. 
 
Byhynde þe reyne3 biside þe spondile3 bene þe lendes, aboue which 
þai ligge as it war in þair pilowes. 
 
Atuix bone reyne3 aboue þe spondile3 passen vena Kilis and aborchy

Þe Reyne3 may suffre sikene3 many, namely opilacioun3 and þe stone. 
3e see in euery side hard maner of curyng. þe which forsoþ yseen, 
3e may cast al away out þe stomac. if þer owe to be made anathomie

Of which it is to be seid bi ordre. 
 
Of partie3 contenyng as to mirac & ciphac & 3irbus it was seid yno3 in

And þer alsone toward þe partie of þe lure is in euerychone a grete 
hole, Of which seiþ G 16=o= de utilitate Capitulo 9=o=.: In þe middes atuix 
of þe heued of þe thie And of þe bones of þe share it was necessari to 
be made a grete hole & a way bi which shulde deseende nerue3 & muscle3 
& veynes & arterie3, which fro aboue bene boren donward. þai bene 
also of þe party of þe pecten streyt to þe maner of a fynne or a gille, 
enioynyng þam in þe pecten. 
 
And þof al it be one bone realy. neþerle3, it haþ .3. nominacions, And 
for-þi of som men þai bene seid .3. bone3 .s. os .i. bone ylij of þe 
vppermore partie Os .i. bone pectinis or pubis fro aforeforþ, Os 
femoris in þe middes. 
 
Of þe partie3 contened þe first þat comeþ to is þe vesic, which is a 
receptorie as a bason or a sac of þe superfluitee of þe vrine ouer-colate 
fro þe reyne3 in-to it, of which þe substance is pannicler, strong, componed 
of 2. pannicle3. 
 
Þe fourme of it is rounde. 
 
Þe quantite as it war of a pyncherye. 
 
Þe site of it in-mediatly vnder þe pecten. 
 
In it forsoþ bene implanted .2. longe waie3 descendyng fro þe reyne3, 
which bene called pori vritides, goyng in diagonaly bi þe sides of it, 
beryng þe vrine fro þe selfe reyne3. 
 
Ther is also in it a carnous necke. with muscle3 closyng & opnyng, 
goyng out fro it reflexibily i. crokyngly, in men passing bi perineum, 
vn-to þe 3erde. 
 
In wymmen with-out reflexion unto .3. fyngers with-in the vlue, 
bi which is put out þe vryne with-outforþ. 
 
Of which þinges is y-shewed þe acte, þe posicion, þe substaunce, & oþer 
þinge3, which bene inquired in oþer membre3. 
 
Also it is shewed þat it is redy to opilacions for þe necke, And to þe 
stone for arenous i. grauely vrine which it takeþ and withholdeþ of it. 

|P_136 
Þer is had þe maner of Ciryngyng. 
 
Also it sheweþ þat in þe necke & wiþ-out þe sewyng of perinei 
oweþ to be done inscision for þe stone, as it shal be seid in þe medicacioun. 
 
Spermatic vessele3 bene som certayne veyne3 which springeþ biside þe 
reynes, descendyng fro vena Kily & aborchi, beryng blode to þe testicle3 
als wele of man as of womman, In which bi more vttermore digestion 
it is made sperme. 
 
Sperme is sede & burionyng of mannes nature. In men þai bene put 
outward for þe testicles of þam bene utward, In wymmen þai abide 
with-inforþ for þe testicle3 of wymmen be with-inforþ, as it shal be 
seid. 
 
Of which þinges it is shewed þat, for be springing of þise vessels, þe 
sperme sauoureþ þe nature of þe lyuer, of þe hert, & of þe reyne3. 
And by þe nerue3, which bi cause of delectacion descenden fro þe brayn 
to þe testicle3, þe brayn haþ comunicacion of þis, & bi consequens .i. 
sewing al þe body. 
 
Þerfor þe sperme after þis is decised fro al þe body no3t forsoþ 
in mole .i. gretne3, bot in vigour i. strengþ, as haldeþ þe Consiliator 
dynus. 
 
Sewingly bi cause of wymmen it shal be seid of þe matrice. 
 
Þe matrix forsoþ is þe felde of manes generacioun, & bi consequens 
it is an organe susceptiue .i. takyng. 
 
Þe site of which is a-tuyx þe vesic & þe longaon. 
 
Þe substaunce of it is pannicler, componed of 2. tunicle3. 
 
Þe fourme of it is rounde, cellulate i. chambred, with .2. hornys or 
arme3. 
 
In þe heued of which is litel testicle implanted in þe vpper partie, 
of þe partie afore forsoþ hauyng a large canale. 
 
It is forsoþ as a yerd reuersed or put inward in 14=o=. de utilitate particlari 
 
It haþ forsoþ 2. arme3 cellulate with testicle3 as þe burse of þe testicle3. 
 
It haþ a comon wombe in þe midde3 as þe partie3 pectinale3. It haþ 
a necke canulate with-inforþ [\f. 19b\] as þe 3erde. It haþ also a wlue as þe 
balane & þe mitre. Also it haþ a tentigo as þe prepucie .i. huske. 
Also it haþ longitude as þe 3erde of 8. or .9 fyngers. And þof al it haue 
no3t bot .2. bosome3 or concauitee3 opne shewed to þe nombre of þe 
|P_138 
pappes, Neþerle3 it haþ ychone of þam threfoldly cellulate & one in þe 
myddes, So þat after Mundyne þer bene founden in it .7. receptacle3. 
 
It haþ colligance with þe brayn, with þe hert, & with þe lyuer, & 
with þe stomac. And it is bounden with þe backe. Atuix it & þe pappe3 
bene continued vene lactale3 .i. mylken veyne3 & menstruale3, wherfor 
seid G vbi supra þat Ipocras seid milke to be broþer to menstrue3; wherfor 
it bifalleþ no3t after þe same tyme þe menstrue3 wele to be done And a 
womman to giffe mylke to sowken. 
 
Þe sekene3 of the matrice bene many; þe maner of medicynyng bi 
pessarie3 is founden of it. & þis of þe matrice. 
 
Vnder forsoþ the forsaid particule3 is founden longaon or þe ri3t 
entrale, þat 3e left aboue in þe anathomie of þe entrale3, which is receptyue 
of superfluitee3 of þe first digestion; Of which þe substance is pannicler 
as of oþer entrale3. The longitude of it is of a palme, nerehand direct 
to þe Reyne3, liggand aboue ossa caude. 
 
Þe nyþer partie of it is said anus. About it bene .2. muscle3 opnyng & 
speryng it. And þer bene applied .5. braunches of veyne3, which bene 
called emoroidale3. 
 
It haþ grete colligance with þe vesic. And for-þy in sikene3 þai 
bene þam selfe compaciente3 to-gidre. 
 
Afterward þe longaon raised vp, þu shale mow see þe veyne3 & þe 
arterie3 & þe nerue3, How þai bene ramified & delegate .i. sent to þe 
partie3 byneþforþ. Of partie3 passyng forþ wiþoutforþ, Se we first of 
dindimo & of osseo, Aboute which bene .2. þynge3 to be seen; ffirst 
contenyng þynge3, þe seconde contened. Contenyng þinge3 bene als 
many þinge3, how many was seid aboue in þe wombe, ffor þe partie3 of 
þise springeþ of þe parties of þam: Of mirac. mirac, of cifac ciphac, 
hyngyng with-outforþ, passyng aboue þe bone of pectinis. 
 
Þe bigynnyng of which, while3 it goþ out, is called dindimus for it is 
doubled. 
 
Þe ende forsoþ osseum or burse of þe testicle3. 
 
Partie3 contened bene .3.; ffirst bene þe testicle3, which bene þe 
principale organe3 of mannes generacion. 
 
In þam forsoþ is þe sperme perfited, Of wham þe substaunce is 
|P_140 
white, carnous, & glandelous. Afterward bene þe spermatic vessele3, 
comyng fro þe aboue-seid, which bene double, .s. dilatorie .i. beryng 
& expulsorie .i. puttyng out. 
 
Beryng bene þe veyne & þe arterie which bene seid for to springe of 
vena Kily & aborchi. 
 
Puttyng out bene þo which, ascendyng byside þe necke of þe vesic, 
putteþ out þe sperme in-to þe hole of þe 3erde, And with þat þer is a 
nerue suspensorie & censitiue, which descendeþ to þe testicle3 / þerfor 
þer bene with-in dyndym & þe burse þe 4. bodie3 yseid. Of which 
it is shewed þat toward þe inguine in Mirac & ciphac oweþ for to be & 
is an hole, bi which descendeþ doun fro aboue .3. bodie3 seid .s. þe veyne & 
þe arterie dilatorie & þe nerue. And with-out biside þe necke of þe 
vesic at þe rote of þe 3erde þe toþer forte, by which descendeþ & is put 
out þe sperme in þe canale of þe 3erde. Also it is shewed þat when þe 
hole toward þe enguine is dilated out of kynd, þe bodie3 aboue as 
3irbus & þe entrale3 may go oute & descende in þe dindym & in þe 
osseo & makeþ rupture & crepiture .i. brustyng. 
 
Also, if it be oþer matere, hernia. 
 
Þe sanacioun .i. holyng of which, shal be seid with-inforþ. 
 
Sewingly it is to be seid of þe 3erde. The 3erde forsoþ is þe agricultor 
.i. þe tiller of mannes nature, Sewingly þe way of þe vrine. 
 
Þe substance of which is componed of skyn, muscle3, tenonte3, veyne3, 
arterie3, nerue3, & grosse ligamente3. It is sette & implanted aboue os 
pectinis. þe ligamente3 comeþ fro osse sacro [\f. 20a\] & þam þat ligeþ to it. 
 
Þe veyne3, the arteries, þe nerue3, þe flesh, þe skyn be bro3t to it fro 
þam aboue. 
 
I[{n{] it forsoþ bene 2. canale3 or principale passynge3, vi3. of sperme & 
of þe vrine. 
 
Þe ende of þe 3erde is called balanum, þe hole mitra. þe huske prepucium. 
þe quantite – a comon 3erde oweþ for to be of 8. or .9. fingers 
with mesurable grossene3. It bi-houeþ forsoþ it for to be proporcionale 
to þe matrice. Pyneum is þat þat arabic translacioun calleþ peritoneum, 
|P_142 
& it is seid þe place atuix anum & putibundum i. atuyx þe lure & þe 
3erde. 
 
Aboue which is a suture .i. a seme which foleweþ þe liniacion of þe 
3erde & of þe burse. 
 
Þe enguyne3 bene þe emunctorie3 of þe lyuer, & þai bene glandelous 
fleshe3, ordeynd in þe plicature3 of þe þies. 
 
Þe buttokes or þe lendes bene grosse musculous fleshe3, ordeynd 
aboue þe bone3 of þe þies. At þe last in þe haunches descendeþ doun 
muscule3, cordes, & ligament3, mouyng & byndyng þe þie3 & þe grete 
legge with þe selfe haunches. 
  
[}Off anathomye of þe legges or of þe grete fete. Capitulum .8.m.}]
The grete foote or þe grete legge dureþ fro þe iuncture of scia vnto þe 
extremitee3 of þe too3. And for þat þe particles of sich a fote or legge 
accordeþ mych with þe particle3 of þe grete hand, as G deduceþ in 3=o=. 
de utilitate, ffor als mych þis grete foote or grete legge is diuided in-to 
3. parties as þe hand was diuided aboue. 
 
One partie forsþ of þe grete fote or legge is seid coxa .i. þe þie. þe 
toþer parua tibia .i. litel legge þe 3=a=. forsoþ þe litel fote. It is soþ 
þat greca translacioun calleþ crus þat arabic calleþ coxam, & tibiam 
þat he calleþ crus. 
 
Bot it is no3t to be charged of þe name3 so alonly þat þe þing be þe 
same Digestis per totum. 
 
Þe grete fote with al þe partie3 of it is componed as þe grete hande, 
of skyn, flesh, veyne3, arteries, nerue3, muscule3, tenonte3, colligacions 
.i. ligamente3, & bone3, Of which it is to be seid bi ordre. Of veyne3 
and arteries opne shewed be þer made a sermon togidre for þe cause 
alleged aboue. 
 
Þerfor after þat þe veyne3 in ramifying fro þair bigynnynge3 descended 
in þe last spondile, þai bene diuided in .2. partie3, Of which one goþ 
to þe ri3t þye, anoþer to þe lefte þie. & þer þai bene diuyded in 2. 
grete braunches. One goþ to þe vttermore partie, anoþer to þe ynnermore 
partie. And in ramifying þai descends bi þe legge to þe ancle3 & 
to þe feete.
