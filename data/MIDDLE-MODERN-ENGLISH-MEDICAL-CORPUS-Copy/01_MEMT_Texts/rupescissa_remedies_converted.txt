[^RUPESCISSA, REMEDIES^] 
 
|P_207 
[\Book Two: The Book of General Remedies\] 
[\f. 33v\] Hic incipit secundus liber, De generalibus remediis. 
In the name of oure Lord Ihesus Crist, here biginneth the ij boke þe 
whiche is callid The Boke of General Remedies in curing and helyng alle maniere 
men of infirmitees. 
 
For the furst boke, þe whiche is the Consideracion of Quynte Essence, is of 
so grete vertue þat of hymsilf al oone þat alle infirmitees curable mowe be helid; 
yit sum men mowe rede and inquere of þe heuenely cunnyng and bigynnyng of 
quynte essence þat I haue y-shewid here bifore. Neuerthelees, þough thay haue see 
and radde this matiere, yit þay haue not þ'intellection þere-of ner consideracion ner 
can not bringe his conclusion to a purpoos in defending and putting away of 
vnhappy and casuel chaunces of nature. 
 
But in this ij boke, I shal teche the remedies alle infirmitees soudaynely to 
hele and cure myraculousely. And with þees heuenely medicines, alle holy lyuers 
|P_208 
shal be made able, wilful, and strong to alle parfite laboure and werkes of vertue. 

Here is the furst remedy: How the fleblenes of olde men may be curid and 
to remedie thaire impedimentz and to restore in holy lyuers youthe and lustynesse 
with þe helpe of God. 
 
Here is the furst remedie and maistrie to cure and helpe the vnprofitablenes 
of olde men and repairing ayen of [\f. 34r\] youthe as hit was afore and restoring of 
nature loste, and to conserue nature in grete helthe and gladnesse vnto þe tyme of 
whiche God hath assigned vnto vs. 
 
Take quynte essence y-made of watre ardent in the vaisshel of circulacion, 
þe whiche is ful rectified and brought to grete merualleuse swetnesse as þe furst 
boke sheweth and techeth to put þere-on quynte essence of golde and perle. 
And lete olde men vse this goldyn watre and drinke þere-of bothe erly and late, at 
euery tyme þe quantite þat wil goo in a note shale. And in fewe dayes he shal 
|P_209 
come to so grete helthe þat hymsilf shal seme to be broughte into þe state and 
lustynesse of xl wintre age. And in hymsilf he shal seme þat he is as yong as 
euer he was. 
 
But greet maistrie is here to vse þis quynte essence mesurably and sildum, 
þat youthe may be recouerid and helthe goten ayen and nature restorid in his owen 
kinde and alwey to be kepte withoute any notable augmentacion or dymynucion. 
And hit is nedeful in this matiere þat he vse good wyne in alle his melys yn þe 
whiche þou may sette quynte essence of golde and perle, as ye haue herde me 
teche of in the furst boke bifore. 
 
[}The ij=de= remedie is ayens deeth and to reyse men fro deeth to life.}] 
Yn this chapitre we clepe þaym dede in whoom we stonde in doute of 
|P_210 
þaire life and þe whiche been so nigh deeth þat phisike and leches forsaken thaym 
for þay been destitute of th'actes of lyfe. But hit muste be considerid þat the 
persone may sumwhat swallowe. To this dede man we shal do cure and helpe and 
hym fonde to arise and leue and speke parfitely hele, inlesse þenne þe last daye of 
lyfe be come, þe whiche is assigned of God to hym. 
 
To areise a dede man as we spake of bifore, lete hym vse quynte essence 
[\f. 34v\] with þe whiche the youthe hath be restored and renued. As sone as a lite 
þere-of is entrid into þe stomake of hym, anone hit bringeth into þe herte þe 
beemes and colour of naturalle lyfe. And þou shal see hym anone arise and be 
right stronge and be myraculeusely cumfortid, the whiche is a meruail of hym as 
who seyeth was able to be grauyd vndre erthe. And yf þou wilte do hit soudaynely 
not withstanding, many a man wil take þis for a scorne, ne-for-þenne high 
miracles been wrought in þis crafte. 
 
Take þe herbe celidoyne whos frute and flours been of goldyn colour, and 
take þere-of the iiij elementz aftre þe maistrie of þe furst boke. Þenne put of 
þ'element of fire of þe celidoyne and putte in þe forseide quynte essence, þe 
quantite of a whete corne, and put hit in his mouthe. And as sone as hit is in his 
stomake, he shal arise and speke. Þenne chere hym and cumforte hym and yeue 
|P_211 
hym euer more of quynte essence til he be vray hole and curid atte vttremest, but 
yf God commande vttrely to deye. 
 
And I seye to þe of vraye trouthe þat þis is þe highest maistrie in 
transmutacoun and chonging of kinde and to saue man is life in þis wise. And 
þere is noo leche now-a-dayes þat can come to þis cunnyng or crafte. And he þat 
wil þis crafte vse or do lete hym haue alle his matieres reedy. 
 
[}Here is the iij remedie in helping of a lepre and in the hyding and puttyng 
yn of hym.}] 
 
Oure Lord God hath sette no peyne for synne in this worlde vttrely but þe 
strookes of infirmitees, þe whiche been horrible. And among alle sikenesses, þe 
plage of lepre is moste cursid and moste lothesum to man and sumtyme harde to be 
curid and sumtyme impossible. For sumtyme hit cometh of þe sending of God as 
þe lepre was sente to þe Constantyne of Grece, þe [\f. 35r\] whiche might not be 
curid but by vertue of oure Lord that sende hym þat sikenes. 
 
But we shal speke here of a plage of lepre þe whiche cometh to a man of 
corrupcion of nature but not by commandement of oure Lord ne suffrance of oure 
|P_212 
maker. And þis sikenes is vndrestonde in ii maner wise. Sumtyme leprenes 
comyth of fadre and modre and sumtyme leprenes cometh of þe principal humours 
þat been putrified and corrupte to nought. And as to þe furst, þat cometh of fadre 
and modre, hit is ful harde or ellis inpossible to be curid. The ij=de= is þis: Yf hit 
be contynued and rotid, hit is ful harde to be curid but not ynpossible. And on þis 
lattre lepre we purpose to do cure, ffor ofte tymes grete lordes and worthy been 
vexed and blemyshid þerewith. 
 
Therefore, by þe licence of God we shal take þis heuenely priuete, quynte 
essence, with quynte essence of gold and perle and hit wil cure hit parfitely. 
 
And yf hit haue indured in a man terme of his life, hit shal dissimule þe 
plage of lepre, for hit wil frete and waste þe corruptible humours, what condicion 
or what qualite þat thay been, and settith alle humours of equite in temperance. 
And hole humours that been any þing appeirid, hit cumforteth. 
 
And yf hit so be þat a plage of lepre come to a man soudaynely, vse aqua 
ardent til þat quynte essence be redy. And I seye to þe of autorite of oure Lord 
Ihesus Crist, þat not oonely quynte essence heleth þe lepre but aqua ardent also. 
Eyther hit heleth þe lepre or hit dissimuleth þe lepre. 
 
And here I shal telle the a greet priuite and a profitable in þis maistrie and 
|P_213 
curing of lepre. Take watre of strowberies þe whiche is swete smylling frute and 
moyste; and þis watre in cure of lepre hath a heuenely vertue. And trowe wel þat 
quynte essence and strawbery watre [\f. 35v\] togedre heleth the lepre wondrefully 
and mervailleusely. And I knowe wel þat with aqua ardent hit doeth þe same. 
And I knowe wel þat watre of strawberyes, of experience, þat hit is ful goodly in 
cumforting nature and þe stomake and putteth oute menstrues, i. woman is wil. 
And hit putteth awey brennyng humours and hit putteth aweye veneym fro þe 
stomake and þe body. And hit helpeth muche to concepcion. 
 
[}Here is þe makyng of strawbery watre.}] 
Take ripe strawberies and put þaym in a vaisshel made of jounkz of þe 
see, and lete hit be of þe grettest younkes; and lete þaym putrifie and receypue þe 
watre distilling of þaym in faire violles and vse hit. 
 
The spiritualle vertue of þis watre is to breke fressh webbes of þe eyen of 
|P_214 
bothe humours which is hote. Hit holdeth not muche þe sighte and hit drieth þe 
terys in bothe cause; and hit clensith þe impedimentz of the sighte in bothe cause. 
 
And I sawe a wyman rawe and fressh in þe face smyten with bladders and 
bleynes of lepre and smyte with a hete, þe whiche was heled myraculeusely and 
sone with þe waisshing of þis watre. 
 
And his vertue is a hunthrid-folde more with aqua ardent and more spedier 
in wirking þanne withoute hit; and hit is muche more mervaillous with quynte 
essence. Kepe þis wel and þou shalt not erre, yf God wil. 
 
Hit nedeth not to vse venymes and suych oþer perillous matieres and 
labours inportable, þe whiche are vsid of many leches. 
 
[}The iiij remedie the whiche is ayenst alle kynde of hurtyng and scabbes of 
þe skynne.}] 
The watre of goodly wirking þe whiche I taught þe to make on þe furst 
boke in þe xiij canon in þe ix chapitre þe whiche begynneth, "God þe maker of alle 
|P_215 
pryuitees" hit. [\f. 36r\] helith alle kinde of scabbe and fretyng awey of þe skynne 
and morfewe and ryueles in þe handes, þ'armes, þe legges, þe necke, þe shuldres, 
þe hammes and the fete and alle oþere lymes. 
 
And whenne holy lyuers goon on thaire fete in trauailling by the world and 
been hurte on þaire fete, put to þe feet of hurting sal tartre calcyned and anone hit 
shal be helid. For hit hath a maniere strength of quynte essence for hit is of þe 
same kinde. 
 
This watre of God is making helith alle ycches and degges. But hit is 
nedeful þat thees men vse oure quynte essence byfore seyde or elles aqua ardent, 
for þere-of the inward humours been purgid and been brought to kindely according 
in thaymsilf. 
 
Put in þy aqua ardent suiche thingz þat wil purge þe humours that been 
fauty; and take thaym oute of þe tables of þe furst boke of thaire propre chapitre. 
 
[}The v chapitre to cure the pallesye.}] 
Alle clerkes according and seyeng, þe pallesie is ingendrid and causid of 
|P_216 
habundance of viscous humours, the whichen shytten the weyes and vertues of 
moving and veyling. And alle thay seyen þat þoo thingz þat been vratife and ouer 
brennyng and desiccatife been contrary in curyng of þis maladie. But þoo þingz 
that been curatife and helyng þis sikenes muste be hote and moiste, temperate, and 
sumdele drauyng and cumforting þe synowes, and cuttyng and departyng þe 
viscosite. 
 
And for noo suche thing might be founde in kinde, þerefore ful fewe men 
þere been that covde hele þis sikenes. For alle suyche þingz that been sharpe and 
departing þe humours and voiding been feyling þe body. And whenne þe lymes 
been fleublid with suche thingz, þay shal be stroyed vtterly. But God of Gloire 
and Maker of Nature hath ordenned to men þat han [\f. 36v\] the pallasie oure 
quynte essence bifore seyde, the whiche abouue alle thingz in this worlde is made 
to cumforte man is body and hit to restore in forme of temprance. 
 
And put in hym quynte essence of suyche þingz that purgen fleaume and 
humours that been viscous, as a lite of euforbe or turbith or eldre or saffron. And 
þenne withoute any thing yf þe sikenes be curable, he shal be helid, enlesse þenne 
hit be withstande of þe wille of God. 
 
And also þou shalt make hym a stewe hote and moiste of herbe yue and 
sauge, the whiche han a godly strength and a heuenely to cumforte the joyntz and 
|P_217 
synowes and brayen and þe moving vertue of man. And yf þou haue noo quynte 
essence a redy, vse in his absence aqua ardent til hit be redy; for aqua ardent is 
grete in wirking and helping of man is body and helth ayenst alle sikenes, yf any 
matiere of wirking be put þere-yn. But þou muste contynue this remedie long 
tyme for this grete sikenes must haue long tyme of helyng yf hit haue long indurid. 
 
[}The vj remedie is for thoo that been consumed in alle the body and ouer 
leene men, as men of tendre complexion and tendre wymen and children and thoo that han the tisik and the ethike.}] 
Oure quynte essence that I haue shewid here bifore shal cure alle thees, 
for þat cumforteth al fleuble nature and restorith hit that is loste and kepith a man 
whenne he is restorid. And yf þou desire to restore notably þe flessh þat is 
consumed and suyche persones that been ouer leen, draue oute the iiij elementz of 
th'erbe celidoyne aftre þe maistry of the furst boke and take þere th'element of 
ayer, the whiche is good oyle, [\f. 37r\] and medel hit with quynte essence or with 
aqua ardent, and vse this. And withynne fewe dayes, he shal be fatte and 
wondrefully restorid. Þere is noon thing to this remedy. 
 
|P_218 
[}The vij remedy is ayenst [{infirmitees{] fantesies and lewde imaginacions 
and contagious steryngz of the deueil.}] 
Vray experience techeth the colerik men haue certayn imaginacions of 
þaymsilfe, though suyche be youen to þaym of kinde of þe humour. And thoo 
þat been fleumatike han oþer fantasies. And thoo þat been sanguine been occupied 
in sundre labours. And thoo þat been ful of malencoly been thoo persones þe 
whiche abouue alle men been replete with most meruaillous thoughtz. For that 
humour ascendeth fully to þe brayen and distrueth alle þe mightes of þe brayen and 
gendrith notable imaginacions and clowdes and horrible thoughtz, bothe sleping 
and waking. And suych men been of þe gouernnance and generacion and 
disposicion of þe kinde and nature of Saturne and namely yf thay bee of ille 
condicion. 
 
|P_219 
To suyche maner thoughtz deueillz gladly assenten and shew on þaym 
pryue temtacions rennyng in thaire thoughtz. And thees men been thus y-turmentid 
and with suyche thoughtz been compelled of þaire owen kinde passions 
to strife and speke to thaymsilf and dispute with þaymsilf þat men mowe here 
þaym. And þees men often tymes been of malencolie humour and with deueillz, 
and sumtyme falle in despeyre and sleen þaymsilf. 
 
The cure of suyche men, yf hit be þe wille of God, is thys: Lete hym vse 
oure quynte essence byfore seyde or watre ardent. And put þere-yn a lite quantite 
of sene or fumyterre or þe herte or the mery of walworte or a thing þat is callid 
lapis lazule, [\f. 37v\] and vse this discretely. And thay shal bee helid perfitely, ffor 
this quynte essence doeth not oonely heele hit but hit putteth awey malencoly. And 
aqua ardent doeth þe same yf any matiere purging malencoly be put þere-yn, and 
þat purgeth þe splene and lettith derke thoughtes. And a malencolie hert and a 
sorowful herte hit gladith. And þe brayen and þe pores there-of hit mundifieth and 
bringeth yn gladde thoughtz. And hit taketh awey þe crafte and temptacions of 
|P_220 
deueillz, and putteth awey vtterly and casteth awey thoughtz and wicked despeyre 
and maketh a man to forgete ille. And hit tourneth a man to his natural witte. 
 
[}The viij remedi ayenst dreede hit is and vnstedefastnesse and destroyeng 
of þe herte and losing of strengthe, and to restore þe vertue and the hardiesse of strength.}] 
Now I shal shewe the that þe whiche man is witte ner vndrestanding may 
not take ner with noo tunge shewe ner telle þe mervaillous vertues þe whiche God 
hath made and ordenned in quynte essence and also in aqua ardent. And yf oure 
Lord haue assigned suyche vertue in aqua ardent, hit semeth wel more þat þe 
meruaillous wirking of Almighty God shuld be in vray quynte essence, and so hit 
is. 
 
Thenne putte yn oure quynte essence: herbe piony, herbe angille, oþer wise 
callid ayglentife, i. saffron, and quynte essence of gold and perle y-medlid 
togedre. And lete hym vse this. And soudaynely þat man þe whiche is ouer come 
with ouer muche gastenesse shal leve his dreede and gastenesse and myraculeusely 
be cumfortid and wondrefully recoure þe strengthe þe whiche was loste of greete 
tymorosite. And hit shal restore [\f. 38r\] hym to hardiesse and put deeth at nought 
|P_221 
and drede noo peril. And he shal bee so hardy þat meruaille is to seye, for he shal 
seme his strengthe so mighty þat he is able to breke and perische iren walles. 
Bilyue þis wel for a sothe, for I telle þis of experience as I haue prouyd. 
 
Therefore, here is a sleygthe and a cautelle þat Cristen princes in 
ordennance of batailles to haue in tunnes and vesshellz, aqua ardent made redy of 
þe herbes and þe golde and perle afore seide þere-ynne, y-put, and þenne yeue to 
euery champion and man of that bataille halfe a cuppe fulle or þere aboute in þe 
bigynnyng of the turment and of þe bataille. 
 
This pryuite shuld be kepte fro alle ennemyes of Holy Churche, for sothe 
I seye to the, suyche þingz shuld be kepte and hidde fro tirantz. This is not to be 
shewed to euery man in comune. 
 
[}The ix remedy is ayenst wicchecrafte and sorcerye and chaching awey 
deueillz.}] 
Holy writte in þe Boke of Thobie, þe vj chapitre, techeth vs opennely by þe 
vertue þat God hath wroughte in bestes þat we mowe put away deueillz fro oure 
howses and dwellingz. As we finde in the precepte, Raphael, þe viij chapitre, 
|P_222 
Tobie put a parte of a fisshe mawe vppon firy coles and with þe smoke þere-of he 
chachid þe deueil awey, þe whiche was callid Asmodeus. But þ'angel Raphael, in 
the vj chapitre seyeth, "Yf þou take and put a litil porschon of þe herte of a fissh 
vppon quyke coles, þe smoke of hit casteth oute al kinde of deueilles bothe fro man 
and wyman in somuche þat thay shal neure vexe thaym no more." Ergo, hit 
foloweth þat vertue in bodily thingz of þe creacion of God haue grete strengthe to 
put awey þe kinde of deueilles bothe fro man and wyman. 
 
And here is [\f. 38v\] the question the whiche is moeued among dottours of 
theologie: Vtrum per talem virtutem a deo in rebus corporalibus concreatam 
possunt demones in rei veritate fugari an non. That is to seye, wethre by suyche 
vertue of God hath ordenned and made in bodily thingz, may deueillz be put awaye 
or not? But noon of thaym þat I knewe or sawe to myne vndrestanding hadde noo 
felyng, but bi siche a vertue and strengthe oure bodies been purgid and disposid þat 
deueillz may not fynde noo malyncoly humours or any other that is according 
thereto to wirke withynne vs. And al by cause of vertues that God hath yeue in 
good thingz of þe whiche thoo humours been purgid. And otherwise deueilles 
been not purged fro vs as þay veylid and seide. 
 
|P_223 
But what opinions þat any man holde or vse, this is þe doctrine and bilyue 
yeue to vs of al Holy Churche, þat yf any particle or parte of þe herte of a fissh 
bee put vppon quyke coles, þe smoke þere-of putteth oute al maner kinde of 
deueilles bothe fro man and wyman in somuche þat thay shal nomore come to 
thaym. And þus shal þou voide suche speche though þow make noo ful answere to 
þe question. 
 
Þenne thay tournid þis question, i. for þis skele, for thay sawe deueillz 
withoute bodies, but þay might not take þaym, yit bodily vertue may bringe 
violente ac naturally to þe spiritualle substance of spiritz and angelz, to whom we 
seye þe contrary. For God hath made in spiritz and also angelz of man a sensible 
powere, not flesshly but spiritually, by þe whiche hit suffrith actions and passions 
of dyuers thingz and bodily vertues. As ye wel knowe þat spiritz may fele 
þ'actions and peynes of þe fire of helle. And this is oure bileue, þat oure spirit 
whenne hit is passid and departid fro oure body hath suyche a power sensitife. 
[\f. 39r\] Hit foloweth wel and sheweth, ffor hit is þe sentence of þe worthy Doctour, 
Saint Augustyn, as he expresly shewith & techith in þe Boke of þe Spirite and 
Sovle. 
 
|P_224 
And for men þat holden opinions ofte tyme been deceipued þat þenke þat 
bodies wirke not in spiritz but þ'actions of bodies, þe whiche bee noo bodies. 
But thingz þat been spiritualle in wirking mowe suffre actions with sensible powere 
of þe spiritz of angelz, and man may be leyde and applied togedre proporcionally. 
We shal not for þayre fleuble coniections and fals opinions goo oute of þe weye 
and vary fro the texte of the Bible. And yf we canne not vndrestande and take þe 
maner doyng there-of, þenne shal we sette oure sovle in oure witte in the 
thraldome and subiection of þe seruice of Crist and to the worship of Holy 
Scripture. And þat euery goodly creature may vndrestande what I meen, I wote 
wel euery holy lyuer knoweth and vndrestandeth þat noo thing in þis worlde made 
is simpliciter and pleynely simple yn forme in likenes as God is. For yf hit were 
so, euery thing in this world made shuld declyne fro the simplenes of God. What 
woundre is hit yf alle spiritz of angelz þay been long, brode, and deupe, yt haue 
þay noo bodies ner noo sensible power in felyng by þe whiche þoo þat haue noo 
bodies but formes of bodies may rather suffre and wille þenne thay þat been 
bodies? 
 
Therefore, euery man þat hath witte and vndrestonding affirmeth with 
þ'angel Raphael þat actions and spiritualle propretees of sum bodily þingz putten 
away alle kinde of deueillz in dede and sum actions spiritualle pleasen þaym and 
|P_225 
sum displeasen þaym. 
 
Deme not in þyself þat I haue ymagined þis of þe newe, for in the colacions 
of Vitis Patrum, a holy abbot affirmed and shewed in his sermons þat sum of þe 
vnclene spiritz haue delite and luste gretely in lecherie and in flesshly 
[\f. 39v\] likingz bothe of men and of wymen, though thay haue noo bodely substance as 
man or beste. And though thay haue suyche luste in lecherie, yit haue þay noo 
bodily seede ner complexion whereby thay may make kindely generacion. 
Therefore, thay take shappe and figure of wyman is body and þenne comuneth and 
deliteth with men and receip[{u{]eth complexion of thaym. And þenne þay 
chongen into the figure of man and þenne thay dele with wymen and geten children 
on þaym with þe forseide seede of man. 
 
Therefore, why shuld this holy man seye þat thay deliten in suyche lustes 
and temptacions but yf þay hadde a spiritualle powere sensible and veyling in þe 
whiche þay suffren suyche actions and felyngz? 
 
Þerfore, leueth suche opinions voyde and lete vs seye þat openne experience 
sheweth. For deueillz han suyche delectacions in þingz that is of þe complexion of 
Saturne and of þe mone and most specially of Mars and þat is wel provid in þe 
pryuetees of nygramancy. For to any ille deede or wickednes he is most t'obserue 
and kepe þe constillacions of two wicked planettz, Saturne and Mars, and oþer 
|P_226 
while of þe mone, as we see in þaym þat suffren influctions and wirking of þe 
mone þe whiche ofte tymes been vexed wickedly of þe deueille as hit sheweth in 
þaym þat han þe falling ille and suyche other that been hirte of þe influence and 
moeuyng of þe mone. But alle maner werkes of nygramancy þat been to 
inuocations or inchantementz muste bee wrought vndre th'obseruance of þe mone 
or ellz hit is nought worth. 
 
And for Saturne hath þe condicions and þe sadnes of leede and is in his 
kinde erthely, blacke, derke, and pryvy cloos and stincking, yeuy[{n{]g power on 
[\f. 40r\] foule placz and blacke stynckyng weyes vndre þ'erthe and derke wodes 
and blacke and solitaire dwelling and horrible. Yn þees places comunely, 
deueillz han þaire conuersacion and appering as we may proue by collacions and 
worthy sermons of Vitis patrum. 
 
And for þe mone hath his kinde wirking vppon þe night and crosse weyes 
and in oþer weyes and journayes. And in suche placz deueillz gladly assenten and 
apperen to þaire sectes and þaire seruantz. 
 
But þoo þingz þat been of þe nature and kinde of Jubiter and of þe sunne, 
þe whiche been beneuoleus planetz and gentil of kinde, displeasen þaym and been 
|P_227 
contrary to thayre wirking to alle deueillz. And þay fle þe lightnes of þe sunne 
and þe presence of Jubiter. 
 
And here is a openne euidence þat þingz þat been in this worlde sum han þe 
figuracion of heuenely joye and sum presenten to vndrestonding þe state and 
gouernnance of helle. 
 
But þe sunne and Jubiter and gold and al þing þat gladith by reason of 
light and clerenes and gladnes, þay presenten þe grete gladnes and gloyre of God a 
high. But blacke Saturne and þe clowdy mone and blacke, and derke presons and 
blacke presenten þe figure and condicions of helle, hauen hate, and dispisen þe 
clerenes and gloriousenes of God and alle blessid þingz, and haten gretely the 
sunne and þe clerenes þere-of and alle thinges that causen any gladnesse. And þay 
haten alle þe weyes and stappes of figures and ymages þat been participatife and 
parteners of þe joy of paradix, with þe whiche man may bee highly cumfortid and 
gladid. And þay lothen heuene and alle heuenely dwellingz. And þay naturaly 
deliten in derkenes and shadowes, yn [\f. 40v\] wreth and sorowe and malencolye 
and alle suyche þingz that presenten and shewen þe complexions of helle. 
 
And aftre þis gouernnance, whenne oure quynte essence is so heuenely and 
brought to so grete swetnes, as hit were, of þ'odoure and sauour of paradise with 
|P_228 
the whiche man may lightly be cumfortid and gladyd, and alle soroweful fantasies 
and deueillz hit putteth aweye opennely, ffor þe condicions þere-of is euene 
contrary to þe deueillz and putteth þaym bothe fro man and wyman as possible 
may be by reason and nature. 
 
And yf þou wil do hit spedefully and maisterfully, put þer-to quynte 
essence of perle and golde with þe seede of a herbe þe whiche is callid perforator 
minor or ypericon, and in openne langaige of Guyenne hit is callid trascalayn. 
The seed þer-of is callid of notable philosophres ffuga demonum, the chaching 
awey of deueillz, and ofte tyme hit hath be prouyd þat þe seed þere-of hath put 
awey wode deueillz fro dyuers dwellingz of houses. And yn oure tyme hit putte 
awey a crueille deueil fro a yonge mayde. But hit wircheth muche more in kinde 
and yf þe seede and þe herbe been gadrid togedre, for hit berith in hymsilf þe 
kinde condicions of ij planettz, þat is þe sunne and Jubiter, þe whiche influence 
and condicions agasten þe deueil by reason and euidence afore seyde. 
 
For Holy Writte in þe Boke of Thobie nor in noon other place nameth not 
the fyssh of whom we shal take þe mawe or þe hert, shal lye in þe fire, and smoke 
þerewith þe deueillz shal be put awey. And also many philosophres in many 
experiences haue founde þat yf þe galle of any fissh, and specially of a fissh þat 
|P_229 
is callid saringrany, and put hit into a boxe of junyper and, yf any man be 
turmentid or vexed with wicches or sorcery or temptid or ouercome with 
deueilles, [\f. 41r\] put the boxe in a fire whenne ye goo to bedde and lete hit 
smoke in al the hows. And with þe smoke, al þe sorcerie and wicchecrafte and the 
werkes of the deueil and spiritz also shal be put awey. 
 
This junipre hath a grete vertue and wondreful, for yf þou make a fire of 
junipre and make askes þere-of a goode quantite and put þer-on oon quyke coole of 
junipre and coure hit with warme askes. For and þou leye oon quyke sparcle of 
fire þere-on and lete hit lie so þe space of a hole yere, and þou shal finde fire ynow 
whenne þou comys þere-to. And þat may be seyde a grete meruaille. 
 
And þe gumme of junipre and al that comyth of hym is vertuous. And 
writers layen hit vppon thaire parchemyn whenne þay write. And here is a grete 
euidence þat sith he may not be wasted and brent in a hole yere, ye may deme wel 
þat he is of þe kinde and rote of noble moystenes. And þerefore hit is profitable to 
man is life, for hit receipueth his kinde influence of þe beste planettz fro abouue. 
 
And philosophres haue be informed with many experiences þat the galle of 
a blac dogge stynketh somuche, i. displeaseth þe deueillz. Yf þe hows be springid 
þerwith, al wicchecrafte and deueillz shal be put awey and þere may noo sorcerie 
be wrought in þat hows. And þay seyen þat þe blode of a dogge is abhominable to 
|P_230 
þat crafte. For yf þe walles of a hows been sprynged þerwith, þere may noo 
sorcerie be doo in þat hows and alle deueillz shal fle awey, but in noon otherwise 
but as þe deueil Asmodeus was put awey with þe mawe of a fissh, as Thobie 
seyeth in þe furst boke, the viij chapitre. 
 
And yf any fals crafte be wrought with benes or oke kernellz or oþer fruite 
or with nedeles þat þe sudary clothe of the dede man lieng ynne bee sewid with, 
and yf wicches wold destroye the and make þe to forsake thy place and lothe hit 
and þou may not avoyde hit with [\f. 41v\] the crafte to fore seyde, philosophres 
seyen þat þou shal close withynne rede quyke siluer and close faste and hide hit 
pryuely vndre þe bed of þe pacient or of hym þat is so vexed, and hit shal cesse. 
 
An other remedy þere is after Holy Churche. Take prestes or suyche 
persones as haue receyued power of Holy Churche and in þe name of oure Lord 
Jhesus Crist, with holy þingz and holy obseruance, þay shal put þaym awey and al 
þing þat is contrary or suspecte to þe feyth. Other forboden by Holy Churche 
þay mowe put awey and alle thees thingz that han be seyde and shal be seyde and 
reherchid herebifore vndre correction of Holy Churche. And I haue seyde here 
noo thing but as Holy Churche seyeth and confirmeth. 
 
|P_231 
[}The x remedi is ayenst lise, ycchyng, hetz, the whiche been sprunge in 
man is body.}] 
The nurisshyng and generacion of lys and of ycche and of hete in 
man is body is of humours putrified, for roten humours by nature been put oute 
and putrified by þe porys of þe skynne and þe mouthe of þe porys. And with 
corrupte humours, wormes and lis been gendrid and ycche and hete of the skynne, 
þe whiche vexen men and suffre not to slepe. And by cause hit is ingendrid of 
corrupcion, þere is noo thing in this worlde medicinal þat better and more naturally 
may cure hit and kepe hit fro putrefaction and consume humours corrupte þenne 
may oure quynte essence, yf þou haue hit redy at hande; or elles take þe beste aqua 
ardent þat þou may gete. For by þ'ordennance of God, hit suffrith noo dede flessh 
to rote nor fissh yf hit be put þere-yn. Ergo hit is right mighty to kepe quyke 
flessh [\f. 42r\] fro rotyng and putrifaction. And this liquour repugneth and is 
contrary to putrefaction and generacion of hete, ycche, and lys. 
 
And whenne my mortalt ennemys ayenst reason wondrefully heulden me in 
|P_232 
prison and in derkenesse, and with þees passions and grete bordon of irons I 
suffrid grete penance and was almost oure-come, and þorough licence of my 
keper, a holy man brought to me aqua ardent and waisshed al my body þerewith. 
And oonely with þat waisshing I was curid and made hole. But I shal teche the to 
make hit an hunthrid folde strenger. 
 
Put ynne thy aqua ardent quyke siluer, staphizagre, and his vertue and 
wirking shal be gretely increchid to sle vermyne in somuche þat thay shal be put 
awey with þe sauoure þere-of and sle thaym. Also quyke siluer is dedely poyson 
to thaym as in þat miraculeuse vertue of God sheweth hit opennely. And yf 
þou putte quyke siluer with gleyre of an egge & medle þaym and shake þaym 
strongely togedre and mortifie þaym and put þere-ynne a long liste of lynne clothe 
and lete hit drinke vp the gleire and quyke siluer togedre, and þenne sewe hit with 
an other liste of lynne clothe--leste þe quyke siluer falle of and gurde þe þerewith 
or bere hit on the--and hit shal put awey alle lys and sle thaym and þay shal falle 
fro hym, þat meruail hit is to seye; and of experience I know hit. Yf þou put 
|P_233 
þere-ynne staphizagre and medle alle togedre, and his might and vertue shal be 
strenger. 
 
And ye shal vndrestande þat þe cure of lys is sumtyme inpossible and 
namely ayenst deeth as hit sheweth in Þ'Actes of þ'Apostellz, þe xij chapitre. As 
hit is seyde, Percussit autem angelus Domini Herodem eo quod non dedisset 
honorem Deo, et consumptus [\f. 42v\] a vermibus exspirauit. And as we haue in 
the Croniclys, the Emperour of Rome with noo remedye of medicyne might not 
be curid ner holpe of his lys. 
 
Here I haue openned a trewe cure and a possible by quynte essence and ye 
haue hit to vse euenyng and morownyng, and to drynke aqua ardent and to waisshe 
þy body þerwith, and medle quyke siluer and staphizagre þere with thy aqua 
ardent, and anoynte þy body þerewith. 
 
[}The xi remedie is to putte awey veneme and to cure hym that is 
poysoned.}] 
The plage of venem is curid with þingz that been moste contrarious there-to. 
What þing is moste contrary to deeth, but life? Ergo, þere is noo thing in þis 
|P_234 
world þat is so contrarious to venem as is aqua vite and moste special quynte 
essence, as I haue seyde bifore. For in þis worlde is noon thing so contrary to 
dedely thingz as is oure quynte essence, ffor hit kepith þe life and increcheth hit 
and kepeth þe herte and putteth awey al contrariousenes. And as sone as hit is in 
the, hit renneth to þe herte and putteth awey alle lesions and heurtz mightiest in 
wirking; and þer is grete bataille with þe veneym. And atte laste hit putteth oute 
þe veneym fro þe body or elles hit putteth hit awey fro þe herte. 
 
And put in þis quynte essence þingz þat been contrary to veneym and 
comforten þe hert, as quynte essence of golde and perle, saffron, pionye, 
arglentife, and þe beste triacle and rue, fenoil, radissh; and his vertue shal be a 
hunthrid folde bettre. And put þerynne alle maner stoones þat been profitable to 
put awey veneym. Put hit withynne quynte essence or aqua ardent and hit shal 
yeue the strengthe and proprietes of hym [\f. 43r\] and his vertues shal be multiplied 
wondrefully. 
 
And whenne þou has put alle þees thingz in oure quynte essence, thenne put 
hit in a noble glasyn vaisshel and close hit wel, þat hit vapore not oute in noo 
wise. And whenne þou supposis to be inpoysenid of any suspecte seruantz, vse 
here-of a lite quantite in the morowenyng yn þe name of oure Lord Jhesus Crist 
|P_235 
and pray to God of helpe; and þere shal noo veneym noye the that day, with the 
grace of God. 
 
[}The xij remedy is ayenst the febre quartayne and alle passions of 
malencolye in man is body. And here is cunnyng to purge þaym and þe maistrie 
there-of.}] 
That leche in al this world is holde moste wise among alle þe whiche in 
fewe dayes can hele þe febre quartane, for þat sikenes is long induryng and noyeth 
riche men and hyndreth poure men and letteth holy men fro God is seruice. Hit 
putteth awey gladnes and bringeth yn sorowe and wasting of þe body, and ofte 
tyme hit bringeth a man to deeth. And sum men magnifie and prechen and praysen 
þaymself muche and seyen þaymsilf cunnyng and seyen þay wil put hit awey in 
fewe dayes and seyen hit is noo cunnyng and hiden þaire ignorance and seyen hit is 
not profitable to cure þayme, ffor he is but a deedely creature. But alle leches 
seyen and accorden þat þe quartane is ingendrid of grete abundance of copy of 
malencolye, þe whiche is corrupte withynne þe body. And for þat humour is erthe 
and of þe kinde of slowe Saturne, þerefore, þ'actions of þis infirmite been in þe 
|P_236 
herte and hit indurith in man custumably often tymes ouer an hole yere. 
 
And yf þou wil soudaynely cure þis infirmite and in short tyme, þou shal 
doo hit with quynte essence, for hit consumeth humours corrupte and superflual 
and hit bringeth nature to equyte of [\f. 43v\] kynde. Hit bringeth yn gladnes and 
sorowe hit putteth away. And hit putteth awey fro alle þe bodye malencolie. 
Igitur ablata causa remouebitur et effectus, that is to seye, whenne þe cause of 
any infirmite is remote and doon awey, þenne is þ'effecte and wirking of þat 
infirmite awey. 
 
And here is þe maniere and curing of hym. Yf þou haue noo quynte 
essence, take a li. of þe beste aqua ardent and put þer-to the pethe of þe mery of 
walworte – and namely of white walworte – and yeue of that euenyng and 
morowenyng to þe pacient ij walnotz shellz fulle or lesse. And he shal be curid 
anone. And lete hym contynue þis remedy til he be hole. And þis is trewe of vray 
experience. 
 
But take þis for a general revle. Turne to þe canon of þe furst boke; and 
þere in þe table of laxatifes þou shal finde þos thingz þat purgen malincoly. And 
put of thaym in thy aqua ardent and take but lite þere-of at oones, þat the matiere 
bi litel and litel may be digestid and voyde in þe same forme. For hit is bettre to 
|P_237 
wirke by litel and litel of curing of þis infirmite þanne soudaynely to gryue nature 
and kinde. 
 
And many philosophres seyen þat a tothe draue oute of a quyke beste, yf a 
man bere hit vppon hym, hit shal delyuer hym fro þe febre quartayne. Also þay 
seyde þat the jus of a herbe callid pympernelle be put into the nostrilles of hym 
whenne þe quartayne bigynneth to shake hym, and he shal be helid, yf God wil. 
 
[}The xiij remedy is ayenst impedimentz and medicines and þe perilles 
þat fallen in yeuyng of medicines and ayenst gryeuance to man is body of þe 
gouuernance of lechis.}] 
Fro the bigynnyng of þe worlde into þis day, alle philosophres han 
laborid with grete swette and besynes aboute medicines laxatifz for iij thingz. The 
furst is þat by laxatifz, kinde [\f. 44r\] and vertue shal not awey. The ij=de= is þat 
þay sle not. The iij=de= is whenne neede, spedefully and effectually withoute any 
peril to wirke in ferre parties of þe body and mightily to bringe corrupte humours 
|P_238 
fro þens. But þees iij mighten neuer be founde parfitely. For whenne þay 
maken any voidance or laxatifz by crafte, þenne þe vertue of kinde is appeirid and 
þe body is fleublid and hat grete lesions and hurtyngz. And so þere mighte noo 
certeyn mesure be founde what we shuld yeue to eury man in certayne. For alle 
bodies been not like in taking of receiptz; ner þe doze nor þe porcion may not be 
like to euery man nor alle bodies been not like mighty to suffre and receipue 
þ'actions of medicines and receiptz. For hit is not all oone in wirking of leen men 
and sklendre and femynyne kinde as hit is in sad flesshly men and thicke. And 
þerefore, sumtyme hit heleth men and sumtyme sleith men, þat is to seye, yeuyng 
of medicines and receiptz in thees dyuers wise wyrchen in maniere to fore seyde. 
And so laxatifz, þe whiche been veneym, sumtyme hurten þat oone parte and 
sumtyme helen on þat oþer parte. 
 
But among alle solempne medicines, high leches and cunnyng commenden 
aloe and praysin hit highly. For as þay veylen and seyen, hit hath leste power to 
lesse any vertue of kinde and causith ful lite hurtyng of kinde in a man. For hit 
wil rather cumforte þe membris as hit proueth wel and euidently by Johan Eheban 
of Mesue in his Boke of Simple Medicines. 
 
|P_239 
But God of his high goodnes hath made quynte essence of aqua ardent in þe 
vaisshel of circulacion y-rectified atte fulle, as hit is made in the furst boke. And 
quynte essence þere-with made of man is blode rectified in þe same wise, and 
quynte essence of gold and perle. Alle thees to [\f. 44v\] gedre maken humours of 
euene qualite in kinde, as hit sleeth alle febres yf þou putte þere-ynne suyche 
thingz that purgen corrupte humours by cause of þe strength and horribilite of þe 
sikenes. 
 
But loke þou be wise in putting yn of þi matiere. And hit shal put awey 
alle inconuenientz bifore seide. For oure quynte essence and aqua ardent also 
kepen and increchen nature and suffren noo vertues to be loste. And in somuche 
as þe receiptes been veneym and contagious, yit quynte essence is euene contrary 
þere-to, yf ye vse your medicines and laxatifz mesurably, as I shal teche þe 
hereaftre. 
 
And for oure quynte essence is more meenable and subtiler in wirking and 
more perisshing þenne oþer thinges. And þerfore he berith moste sharpely and 
mightyest with hym alle laxatifz to membris ferre of and to diepe places and so to 
ferre places; and bryngeth oute noyous humours miraculeusely. 
 
And þere is an other thing the whiche leches couthe neure shone in 
|P_240 
yeuyng of medicines laxatifz; but often tymes thay braken hit vp ayen and so þe 
labour of þe leche and the coste of þe medicine is loste and þe pacient vnholpe. 
But by oure quynte essence or aqua ardent, suyche vomettz and causes been put 
away. For yf þe quynte essence of any laxatife thing be put in oure quynte 
essence spiritualy, hit suffrith noo maniere vomett ner braking to be ingendrid in 
þe stomake. For þe spirituale receipued shuld not be voyded, yit hit semeth 
possible þat þe humours þat been ingendrid in þe stomake shuld be voide by 
vometing. And many of þees medicines been venoym and hurten often tymes 
of þaire owen kinde. But with quynte essence or aqua ardent, hit doeth not so for 
þorough cumforte of quynte essence, hit is not hurte. 
 
Now I shal yeue þe remedis ayenst perillz þat might falle in yeuyng of 
medicines laxatifz with quynte essence [\f. 45r\] or aqua ardent. For I seide bifore 
þat medicines laxatifz wirken more strenger and sharper with aqua ardent þenne 
withoute hit. Therefore take þis for trouthe, þat the quantite of any medicine þat 
|P_241 
is assigned by any cunnyng to be take to any sike creature withoute harme of 
deeth. Yf þat same medicine be yeue with aqua ardent, hit sleeth a man, for þe 
medicine shal wirke x tymes more with aqua ardent þenne withoute hit. 
 
And yf ye wil trowe me, I shal yeue to you a exemple. I was grieuousely 
sike in þe breste and fulle of viscous humours. And I toke of yerepigra and of 
euforbe ana oz. semi and þere-of I made pillulz to þe gretenesse of a smalle chery. 
And iij pillulz oonely þere-of I put in a litel watre ardent and brake þaym smalle 
with my fyngre and receipued hit late at euenyng. And by þe power of God, þe 
medicine wrought after mydde-nyght merueilleusely x tymes or day by sieging 
or voiding bynethe. And aftre þat I toke my reste and sleupe. I arose al hole at 
morowe and gladde withoute any heurte bothe in sight and yn my lymes. 
 
Therefore ye shal vndrestande þat yf a man toke x of þees pillulz, þe 
smallest þat he mighte chese and vse þaym, and þay shal not wirke somuche 
withoute aqua ardent as iij shuld with aqua ardent. And þerfore, wisedame wolde 
þat þou put oone of þees in aqua ardent and assaye how þat wol wirke in þe 
pacient; to sum ij or iij til þou finde cure and experience þat þe medicine helpeth 
and cureth þe persone. For here is a generalle roule what þou shal yeue to euery 
man, for sum man is mightier þan sum, sum been flesshy, and sum leen. And 
þerfore þe wirking is diuers in persones and þou may not yeue y-like muche to 
euery man. And here þou may see what profite hit is to receipue medicines with 
|P_242 
quynte essence or aqua ardent, ffor yn this crafte hit peireth not the kinde nor þe 
sight, [\f. 45v\] ner hit sleeth not. And yf þou wil proue þis wisely, hit shal bringe 
humours fro remote places and kepeth awey veneym fro medicines and kepeth a 
man fro vometz. For good hit is to take but litel of þees þingz in þy quynte 
essence; and hit shal hele the verraily. 
 
This chapitre is clepid þe key of þis crafte, withoute whos vndrestanding 
þere may noo man clerely and trewly noo maniere medicine, laxatife, nor receipte 
mynistre. 
 
[}Here is the xiiij remedie ayenst the febre quartayne and the cure there-of.}] 
Alle leches han discernyd þat a febre contynual is y-gendrid of putrefaction 
of blode and of corrupcion of humours in his body. Therefore, þe cure of þat is to 
purge blode and to remoeue away al þe corrupcion þere-of and alle humours that 
been veneym and inparfite to make thaym equale and to repaire nature lost. And 
whenne hit is restorid, to maynteyne and kepe hit. And oure quynte essence 
wirketh and fulfilleth alle þees thingz. 
 
Ergo, hit moste needes folowe þat hit moste cure þe febre contynual of 
whom I spake bifore. For experience sheweth opennely þat watre ardent putteth 
away watery humours and corrupte fro blode. And sith hit is so, þat hit kepith 
|P_243 
rawe flessh and dede fro corrupcion, by more reason hit shuld kepe the blode of a 
lyuely creature fro corrupcion and putrefaction. But for cause þat aqua ardent is 
not fully departid and depurid fro þe hete of þe iiij elementz, þerefore, I wol not 
þat þou vse hit in curyng of þe febre contynual. But quynte essence ful and 
parfitely rectified in þe furste boke, þe whiche is hote nor moiste nor drie as þe 
iiij elementz been, this quynte essence heleth sikerly and [\f. 46r\] trewly alle þe 
passions of þe febre contynual, and namely quynte essence of gold and perle. And 
yf þou wil cure hym parfitely, take quynte essence aftre þe forme of þe furst boke 
y-made of man is bloode. And þat same quynte essence helith perfitely þis 
infirmite, not oonely to drinke þere-of but also yf þou waisshe or enoynte þi 
temples þer-with and þe pulse veynes of euery parte of þe body. 
 
And yf þou put þees ij quynte essence togedre, þat is to seye, þe furste 
quynte essence & quynte essence made of man is blode, þenne shal þou haue a 
trewe medicine. And yf þou wilt increche hit in wirking, put in þees quynte 
essences: þe quynte essence of cassia fistula or þe jus of mercurie wisely 
proporcined. And þe cure shal be an hunthrid folde bettre. 
 
And yf any other humours been fovnde fauty or corrupte with blode, putte 
þere-ynne quynte essence of suyche þingz as purgen þoo humours as þou shal finde 
|P_244 
in þe table of purgacions and laxatifz; and with þe helpe of God þou shal be curid. 
Vndrestande wel in thy herte what I haue seyde and þou shal not faille yf þou 
wirke wisely aftre þe reules þe whiche I haue taughte þe, both in þe furst boke and 
in þe secunde, þe whiche is present. 
 
[}The xv remedie is ayenst þe febre terciane; and here is cure of hym.}] 
A febre tercian aftre doctrine of wise men is ingendrid of grete 
plenteuousenes of rede colere and putrefaction of hym. And yf þou wil hele hit 
soudaynely, take quynte essence yf þou haue hit or elles aqua ardent and put þere-yn 
a lite rubarbe or elles aloes or saffron colour or sum oþer thing of þe tables of 
þe furst boke that purgeth colere. And put þere-to a good quantite [\f. 46v\] of 
þ'erbe of endyue and vse this euenyng and morovenyng. And withoute any 
doute he shal be helid hastily and sone. 
 
[}The xvj remedie is ayenst a febre cotidian and þe cure of hym.}] 
|P_245 
Alle maistres been accordid þat þe febre cotidian is ingendrid of 
putrefaction of fleaume and supefluite þere-of; and suyche fleaume is colde and 
moyste. Oure quynte essence or aqua ardent hath grete strengthe and meruaillous 
to waste and put away þe grete colde; and of watrenes and putrefaction hit hath a 
dyuers wirking in consumyng þere-of and ofte þe humydite. And fetteth oute þe 
rote þere-of and heleth hym profitably. Þerefore, put þere-ynne a lite euforbe aftre 
þe doctrine and reules of grete leches and wise or eldre or oþer the whiche purgen 
fleaume as þou may finde in þe table of þe furst boke; and vse hit euenyng and 
morovnyng. And he shal be helid anone, yf God wil. 
 
[}The xvij remedie is ayenst a sharpe febre and lunatike men and of madde 
men and foles. Here is þe cure of thaym.}] 
Here experience sheweth by reason alle maniere werkes þat aqua ardent 
ascendith vppe to the heede and maketh men drunke. And sith hit is so þat þe 
sharpe febre hath his wirking in þe region of þe heede, þerefore hit is necessary to 
the to haue oure quynte essence bifore seyde and quynte essence of gold and perle. 
|P_246 
But in an other parte þou moste haue quynte essence of man is blode ratified; 
and put þere-to quynte essence of rose watre and violette and borage and of letuce 
and medle þaym togedre and vse hit in þe name of oure Lord Jhesus Crist. And 
þou shal haue a parfite and a heuenely medicine [\f. 47r\] and þou shal be curid 
þerewith. 
 
And often tyme a sharpe febre is ingendrid of a brennyng violent colere and 
blode; and sumtyme of a blak brennyng colere; and sumtyme of oone of thees and 
sumtyme of ij togedre and sumtyme of alle iij. And aftre þat, þe sharpe febre is 
sumtyme highere and sumtyme lowere in dyuers degrees. And to alle þees degrees 
of adustions of blode curith and helpeth quynte essence of man is blode with þe 6 
parte of oure quynte essence. And yeue hit to þe pacient and he shal be sone hole, 
yf God wil. 
 
And whenne þou seest þe pacient sum what to mende, þenne put yn þe 
quynte essence of blode, þe quynte essence tofore seyde, i., the v parte of oure 
quynte essence. And whenne he is more holer, put hit to þe iiij parte and 
aftrewarde to þe iij parte and so lesse til hit be al awey. And so þou shal vse atte 
laste but oure quynte essence. 
 
And also þe sharpe febre hath maniere alienacion of witte and visions of 
|P_247 
diuers þingz and fantasies. And here by þou shal vndrestande what humours been 
aduste and been cause of þat sharpe febre. Yf so be þat þe pacient seme to see 
blak thingz, þenne blak colere is aduste. And yf he see golden thingz, rede colere 
is aduste. And if he see rede thingz and effusion of blode, þe blode is aduste. 
And yf he seme to see alle þees iij, þenne alle the humours þat we spake of bifore 
been fauty. 
 
Thenne to cure þe frenasie and þe madnes and þe woodenes of þaym þat 
han þis sharpe febre and to swage hit at fulle, take a good quantite of populeon and 
þe beste vin aigre þat þou may haue and a good quantite of gardyn rue and grynde 
hit smalle and medle al togedre; and medle þerewith quynte essence of man is 
blode, [\f. 47v\] yf þou haue any. And with this heuenely confection þou shal 
wrappe þe heede al cloos of þe pacient and put of þe same confection to his nose 
thrillz. And þis same doeth put awey þe frenasie anone and alle fantasies þat 
been shewid to hym. And hit putteth awey woodnes and lunatikenes and restoreth 
discrecion and witte and bringeth hit to knowelaiche and maketh hym to haue reste. 
Kepe þis wel and haue good perseuerance in thy wirking and God shal saue the. 
 
[}The xviij remedie is to cure the iij emitrices.}] 
|P_248 
Thay that by crafte of medicines knowen iij emytrices the whiche sumtyme 
genderen in oure body ful perillous; thay knowe þe lasse emytrice, þe myddel 
emitrice, and þe more emitrice. Emytrice is a febre þe whiche is gendrid of 
corrupte humours and contrari in kinde, þe whiche is causid of fleaume 
putrified, and so þe febre is colde and moyste; and of rede colere putrefied and 
so þe febre is hote and drie. And so in þe body been ij febres contrary in kinde, 
as a febre whiche is causid of fleaume, for þat is colde and moyste; and of rede 
colere putrified also and so þe febre is hote and drie. And so in þe body been ij 
febres contrary togedre. 
 
And by nature a inprudente leche wolde suppose þe cure of þaym to be 
inpossible. For yf þou woldest yeue to þe pacient ayens þat is hote and drie, 
colde and moyste, þenne þou shuldes increche þe febre þat is colde and moiste. 
And yf þou yeue ayens þe febre colde and moiste, hote and drie, þenne þe febre 
whiche is hote and drie shal increche withoute any doute. And yf þou yeue hym 
hote and drie, colde and moiste euene porcion, þat oone shal lette þat other in 
|P_249 
wirking, and the pacient vnheled. 
 
Wherefore, þe trewe cure here [\f. 48r\] of is this. Þou shal yeue hym 
oure quynte essence bifore seide and lete hit be euene half medled with quynte 
essence of man is blode and quynte essence of gold and perle and with a lite quynte 
essence purgyng thoo humours þat been fauty. And with þis doze alle emytrices 
shal myraculousely be helid and sone passe awaye. 
 
And here ye shal see how many emitrices been in oure body and how thay 
been ingendrid. As often tymes, as any of þe iiij principalle humours been 
corrupte togedre in oure body may be founde, as þou shal see bothe þe furst and þe 
secunde and þe thridde and many other, as fleaume and rede colere. The furst 
maniere is of fleaume and colere aduste. The secude maniere is of fleaume and 
blak colere. The thridde is of fleaume and blak colere aduste. The iiij=the= is of 
blode and fleaume aduste. The v and þe 6 been causid and ingendrid of many of 
thees. And by þees þou may vndrestande and dyvyne oute many of thees 
emitrices. 
 
[}The xix remedie is ayenst þe febre pestilence and þe cure there-of.}] 
|P_250 
Hit were but a fantasie and a folie to seke remedie whenne þe sikenes is 
incurable, as whenne deeth is sent to slee þe peuple of þe high commandement of 
þ'emperalite of our Lord Jhesus Crist. For we see autorite of Holy Scripture þat 
pestilence often tymes is nurisshed and suffred of God to slee þe peuple, in suyche 
a cooste where God wil þat vengeance falle vppon this man or þat wyman. We 
purpose not in þis purpoos and in swyche cause to doo noo remedies, ffor hit is 
harde to stryue ayens þe pricke and þat God of his high emperalite sendeth þe 
pestilence to slee þe peuple as witnessyng þe scripture in Deutronomye þe xviij 
chapitre homini sicut dicitur. [\f. 48v\] Si audire nolueris vocem Domini Dei tui vt 
custodias et facias omnia mandata eius veniant super te omnes maledictiones iste. 
Maledictus eris in ciuitate. Et infra adiungat pestilenciam dominus consumet te de 
terra. Percuciet te dominus egestate febre et frigore ac ardore et estu et aere 
corrupto ac rubigine et persequatur te donec pereas. Hec Moyses ymmo Deus per 
eum et infra percuciet te Dominus vlcere Egipti et partem corporis per quam 
stercora egerunt scabie quoque prurigine ita ut curari nequeas percuciat te 
dominus cecitate ac furore mentis. Et est propositum. 
 
I pray you what man is he þat wille presume þe febre pestilence to be 
curable þe whiche cometh of þe wille of God sith þe holy texte seyeth bifore þat 
|P_251 
þay may be vncurable; þerefore, hit is but a fantasie to take suyche thingz a hande 
sith thay been insauable. 
 
And þe forme of þis volume atte th'ynstance of menke chosen men, I 
determyned in þis matiere in þe tyme of þe grete pestilence þe yere of oure Lord 
Jhesus Crist M=l= ccc xlviij. And þenne I disputid with many wise men to begynne 
þis pourpoos and to bringe hit to a short conclusion. 
 
And ye shal vndrestande þat men mowe deye ij or iij maniere wise. Oone 
maniere wise by natural deeth, as God hath ordeyned to vs, þe whiche we mowe 
not passe by noo witte nor reason. An other wise by violence. And þerefore to 
thees ij maniere wises þer may noo maniere medicine auaille. But anoþer 
maniere þere is for a man may deye vnreasonably byfore þe terme þat God hath 
ordeynid to man, as in to muche etyng or by to grete abstinence or dispeyre or 
negligence to shone the peril of deeth and so slee hymsilf. And in þis wise, 
whenne God sendeth þe vengeance of pestilence to certayne persones of þe peuple 
to slee þaym and hurte þaym and mahayme þaym, þe whiche God commandeth not 
to be sleyn, yit þay mowe wille [\f. 49r\] fully and negligently deye, yf þay wil. 
For God made man and yaue hym fre wille and fre choise to chese bothe good and 
ille. 
 
|P_252 
And yf we shal do any cure vnto thys pestilence, here is general reule. 
Where God sendith pestilence of þ'influence of Saturne as ye mowe see in þe 
plage of lepre, reume, consumyng of þe body, passion of þe breste, and alle 
suyche as been causid of þe pestilence colde in man. Or elles febre pestilence 
with spitting of blode þe whiche is causid of þ'influctions of Mars, and also 
aposteumes vndre þe myddereve to strangle þe herte, and boicches and blaynes and 
moste in þe necke or elles in his armeholes, and brennyng sores and felounys and 
carbunclys and many oþer brennyngz. And sum been causid of þ'influctions and 
of þe malice of Mercurie, as in armoles and byles in þe brevys vndre armepittz 
and in þe berde and in þe breste. And sum malice is causid of þ'influctions of 
þe mone, as þe falling ille horrible dremys, þe whiche make men madde or any 
other pestilence or sikenes of þe sonde of God. Alle þees been parfitely helid and 
curid with oure quynte essence, for hit putteth awaye parfitely alle thees malices 
and hit shal neure noye þe, yf God wille. 
 
|P_253 
But in þe febre pestilence and in alle brennyngz and blacke and 
brennyngz, put with oure quynte essence half as muche of quynte essence of man 
is blode and put þer-to þe rote of lange du buef or elles alle þ'erbe of wodesoure 
and a lite aloe epatike, euforbe, yerapigra, and quynte essence of þe rote of þe lilie 
and of golde and perle and mayden here and isope. And alle þees curen and been 
contrary to suyche febres and aposteumes. And hit is nedeful þat þou put in 
þe forsaide laxatife quynte essence and lete hym vse there-of euery day oones, and 
threys in þe wike vse þees laxatifz and nomore; but vse alle oþer quynte essence 
bifore seyde withoute any laxatife. And euery day vse [\f. 49v\] there-of an egge 
shelle ful at oones and of good watre ardent; and iiij or vj tymes in þe day vse at 
euery tyme a Frenche note shelle ful and þe corrupte aier withoute any doute shal 
not noye the. And loke þou vse thees thingz þat leches finde in þaire bokes, þe 
whiche been contrary to pestilence. And lete þaym vse pillulz in quynte essence or 
in aqua ardent aftre þe bokes of phisike; but lete þaym vse hit seldum and lite at 
oones. And make fumigacouns strongly iij tymes a day with encense and myrre 
resyne and treburtyne and rue and many other. And here is þe parfite cure of 
|P_254 
pestilence bifore seyde. 
 
[}The xx remedie is [{ayenst{] the febre þe whiche is causid and gendrid in 
þe crampe to hele hit.}] 
Most wisest leches affirmen and seyen þat þe febre is oonely causid and 
ingendrid in þe crampe. And þay þat been experte of þis seyen yf þe rubbe or 
freete and rubbe alle þe parties of þe body where þe crampe and þo febre is with 
spereworte til þe pacient be curid and þe peril and þe malice of þe crampe bee 
cessid and sette in temprance. And aftre doctrine of wise men, þe crampe 
propriely cometh of hurting and fleblenes of synowes, as hit sheweth in þaym 
þat vsen elebre. And þere is noo thyng more spedeful to put away þe crampe 
þenne oure noble quynte essence or aqua ardent in his absence. Laus deo.
