[\Chapter I, The Head 
Part 1, Headache\] 
|P_1 
[\f. 48\] If þe hed-ache be of hete, lete him vse coolde þingis, 
as watir of endyue or of roses, and specialy sugur roset 
and sugur of violet. And let him kembe his hede with an 
yuery kombe oftetymes, for þat is gode in euery ache of þe 
hede. And let him wasshen his fete with warme salte 
watir. And let him abstyne him from moche waking, and 
moche þou3t, and from þe company of women, and moche 
baþing. 
 
Sugyr roset is þus made: Take a pounde of sugir and 
halfe a pounde of tendir roses lyues, and stampe hem wel 
togedir til þey be smale grounden and wel medlid with þe 
sugir. And þen do þat in an erþen vessel and set it in 
þe sunne þritty dayes aftir mydsommer. And euery day, 
styre it [\f. 48v\] twies, ones in þe morwetide and ones in þe 
euentide. But whan xv daies ben y-passid, take halfe 
a pounde of sugir not ful smale-y-grounded and medle it 
with þe toþir with þin handes. And when þo þritty daies 
ben y-passid, put it in a boxe and kepe to-close. This 
sugir roset is gode for euery fluxe of þe wombe and for 
|P_2 
yuelis þat comen of coler, þat is to sey, of hete and 
drienes. 
 
In þe same wise is sugir of violettis y-made. And 
þat is gode for al maner of vnkynde hetis, and for sekenes 
of þe breest, and of þe sydis, and of þe ly3te, and of 
þe lyver, and for þe cardiacle, and for þe feuer tercian. 
 
But if þe hede-ache be of flevme, þat is to sei, 
of cooldenes and of moystnes, let him wasshe his fete 
with warme salt watir euery ny3te. And let him often 
kembe his hede with [\f.49\] an yvery combe. And of þe asshis 
of heyne-houe and of elern bowes in grete quantite, and 
of þe asshis of egrimoyn and of betayn, make lye and 
wasshe þerwith his hede, for þis is gode boþe for falling 
awey of heris and to do awey þe ache. Anoynte also his 
hede with oyle of ellern eiþir of syneuey. Also take 
galbanum and do it in a pece of leþer, and ley it to 
þat place þat akiþ. And make a plastir of whete mele 
and of marche, wormode, heyhoue, rwe, fenel, and louage. 
And let him leve malencolious metis, as oxe flesshe and 
veneson; and fleumatike metis, as white metis, bottir, 
ches, mylke, porke; and salt fysshe, and fresshe fysshe þat 
is ful fleumatik, and also elys and congir. And lete him 
ete noo raw peeris ne applis, ne onyons, ne suche oþer 
rawe þingis. Nottes he may ete, but not meny. And let 
|P_3 
him vse þe sau[{ce{] [\f. 49v\] of garlike and of pepir, gynger, 
clowes, myntes, peletre, and vynegre. And gode clere 
white wyne is gode for him. And let him absteyne him 
from long fasting and also from ydelnes, from wraþþe, 
from waking, and from colde. Baþeng is gode, but not 
ofte-tymes. 
 
If þe ache be of malencoly, þat is to sey, of drines 
and of colde, let him vse al-þinge as þoughe it were of 
flevme. But let him vse oxymel to purgen him of malencoly: 
eiþir simple oximel eiþir oxymel compovned. 
 
Symple oxymel is made of hony and of vynegre, two 
partis of vynegre and þe þirde parte of hony, y-medlid 
togederis and soden. 
 
Oxymel componed is made on two maners: Summe is 
made of oximel simple and of oþer þingis y-put þerto, 
as oximel squilli[{ti{]ke and oximel of radiche. Þe toþir 
oximel componed is made of oximel [\f. 50\] simple and of many 
oþir maner þingis. 
 
Oximel squilli[{ti{]ke is þus made: Take an oynon of þe 
see þat is clepid in Latin squillia and do awey þe vttir 
shellis of þe oynon, for þei be to hote. And as meny as þou 
doist awey of þe vttermest, so meny do awey of þe innemest, 
for þei ben to colde. Take þen hem þat ben in þe myddil, 
and seþe hem in vynegre, and aftirward clense hem. And kast 
|P_4 
þerto þe iii part of hony and make it vp. 
 
Oximel of radiche is þus made: Take þe rote of 
radiche and kit it into smale þynne rollis, and seþe 
hem in vynegre. And aftir clense hem and streyne hem 
And do þerto þin hony as it is seyde now. 
 
Oximel componed is made of meny þingis, and it defieþ 
and loseþ malencoly, and departiþ it, and makeþ it þynne 
and openeþ þe weies þat ben stoppid of þe lyver and also 
of þe spleen. Take þe rote of marche, fenel, parcil, 
calamynte, tyme, rosmaryn, [\f. 50v\] syngrene, and oþer herbis 
þat purgen malencoly. And if þou wilt haue it stronge, 
do seen þerto. And streyne it and aftir þat caste þerto 
þin hony. If þou wilt 3eue a man oximel componed, 3yue 
him first oximel simple. But if þe hede-ache comeþ of 
þe sikenes of þe stomake or of eny oþir sikenes or of eny 
oþer membre, hele þat sekenes and þan þe ache wole awey. 
And if it comeþ of moche waking, make him to slepe. And 
if it comeþ of angir, or of sorowe, or of moche fasting, 
make him to leue suche þingis and drawe him to do þe 
contrary þingis. 
 
And if he haue a demegreyn, þat is, þe ache of oon 
side of þe hede, let him vse pillules Arabie, for þei ben gode for 
euery sikenes of þe hede, and for euery 
ache of þe hede, and purgen al noiful humours of þe 
|P_5 
brayn, and maken [\f. 51\] a man glad. Þei doen awey heuynes, 
and sharpen a mannes wittes and a mannes sy3te, and saven 
his mynde. And þei suffren not a man to be hoor tofore his 
tyme. And also þei helpen a man þat haþ þe turnyng of his 
brayn and þe demegrayn. And þei ben good for men 
and women also. 
 
And þei ben made on þis wise: Take of alloes epatike, 
dr. iiii; of brome, of mastike, of baies of lorer, of 
scamonye, and of clowes, of eche of þes, oz. i. And 
medle þes with þe iuse of caule eiþir of fenel. And 
do þerto a litil hony forto kepen it, for hony wol keke 
al maner medisyns þat it is put to from appeiring. A 
man þat haþ þe hede-ache of ony humour in his hede shulde 
not eten comyn, ne anees, ne noon oþir aromatike þyngis, 
[\f. 51v\] for þey wolen heve vp smokis to þe hede þat shulde 
encrese þe ache. And if þer be ony emplastir leide to 
þe hede, it must be warme, þoughe it be made of hote 
herbis, to habate þe coolde of þe heed, for if it be 
leide al coolde to þe heed, it wole do harme to þe brayn. 
 
For þe demegreyn: Take sangdragon and tempere it 
with þe white of an eye wel-swonge, and make a plastir 
as brood as þe soor is. And þus do twies or thries til 
þou be hool. And in leyeng to of þe plastir and when 
it is plastrid, sey þis Colet in worship of Seynt Joon 
|P_6 
Baptist: Perpetuis nos domine Sancti Iohannis Babtiste; 
tueri, presidere, etc. Anoþir medisyn for þe same: Take 
auence, myllefoyle, and ruddes, ana, dr. iii; and þre 
croppis of bawme. Stampe hem smale and drinke hem with 
ale. And reste þe vppon þe soore side. 
 
[\Chapter I, Part 2 
Other Sicknesses of the Head\] 
[\f. 52\] In a mannes hede þer ben many oþer sikenessis as 
wel as aches. And somme sekenessis comen of fume and 
smokis þat fleen about a mannes brayn, as turnyng vp 
of þe brayn and scotomy. Oþer sekenesses ben of humours 
þat ben y-turned to postemes in sum parti of þe brayn 
as frenesy, þat is a postem of coler in þe foreparty of 
þe brayn; and woodnes and leesing of mannes wit and 
of reson þat is a postem in þe myddel of þe brayn; and 
litarg[{i{]e þat is leuyng of mannes mynde þat makeþ 
him for3eful and is a postem in þe hyndir party of 
a mannes hede; and epilencie þat comeþ of an humour 
þat filleþ þe partis of a mannes brayn þat shulde 
be voyde of suche humours, and makeþ a man for þe 
tyme to leesen his wit and his meving. And he 
lieþ stil as þoughe he were [\f. 52v\] deed. Anoþir yvel 
is callid appoplixie, þat comeþ of humours þat 
stoppeþ þe poores of þe brayn, and makeþ a man to 
leve his wit for þe tyme and al maner meving, saaf 
oonly breþing. Þat is þe difference bitwixte it and 
|P_7 
epilencie. 
 
Scotomye is suche a sekenes of þe brayn, þat it 
makeþ a man to seme þat he seeþ flies or blacke þingis 
in þe eyer. Turnyng of þe brayn makeþ a man semen þat 
al-þinge þat he seeþ as it semeþ to dronken men: þat þe 
house goeþ aboute hem and þat þe weie riseþ a3enst hem. 
And þis sekenes comeþ of þe stomakes greuaunce, eiþir of 
smokes, eiþir of humours þat ben aboute þe brayn. And if 
it be of þe stomake, þes ben þe tokenes: Þe herte lepiþ 
and haþ grete greuaunce. And aftir mete, þe greuaunce 
takiþ a man. And when þey bowen hem doun, her brayn 
turneþ, [\f. 53\] þat is to seie, hem semeþ þat þo þingis þat 
lien stille rennen aboute. But if þis sikenes come of 
blode, þese ben þe tokenes: His temples mouen faste; 
hevynes of his browes; and moche þou3t of rede þingis, as 
of brenyng of laumpes; and bleding of þe nose; þycke vryn 
and rede, and derke above as blode. 
 
Of coler, þes ben þe tokenes: bitternes of mooþ, 
gnawing at þe herte, þyn vryn and ful rede and ful derke 
above. 
 
Of malencolie, þes ben þe tokenes: sournes of mouþe, 
and 3elewenes of þe vryn and þinship, and wiþholding of 
fluxes. 
 
Of flevme, þes ben þe tokenes: greuaunce aftir 
|P_8 
mete, and ache of þe sidis, and meeting of watres and 
of reynes, and of white þingis, and vnstablenes of þou3t. 
 
And if þe greuaunce come of þe stomake, [\f. 53v\] it lasteþ þe 
whiles þe smoke comeþ from þe stomak to þe hede, and 
aftirwarde it cesiþ. And þer is ache, and greuaunce, 
and abhominacion in þe mouþe. And a man may feele hou 
þe smoke goeþ vp into þe heed. And þe helpe þerof is 
to caste or to spue. And grete boistous metis þat wole 
not be defied li3tly, þou shalt not ete. And leve late 
soopers. And grete metis, and cavl-wortis, and strong 
ale, and benes, and peesen, ete þou not. But vse þou 
suche metis þat wolen eesely be defied. 
 
If þe greuaunce comeþ of blode, leting of blode is 
profitable on þe heed veyne, and so it is in euery sikenes 
of þe hede þat comeþ of blood. If it is so þat he þat 
is sike be replet of blood or of ony oþer humour, let him 
dieten him as it seide of þe hede-ache. [\f. 54\] And let him 
vse þes pillules þat purgen þe heed of yuel humours, 
and also þei ben good for þe si3te and for þe hering. 
Thus þei ben made: Take of alloes þat is wel wasshen, 
oz. ii; of mirabolani, ana kebulis, indorum; reubarbe, 
mastike, wormod, roses, violet, sene, agarike, cuscute, 
of eueriche ylyche moche, dr. i. Tempere al þis with 
þe iuys of fenel. And if þou wilt make it sharpe, caste 
|P_9 
þerto dr. vi & 1/2 of scamonie y-poudrid. And make þerof 
gobettis of þe gretnesse of a fygge and 3yue of hem xi or 
xiii at oo tyme, for þei ben ful laxatif. And if þou 
wilt purge him of coler, double or treble mirabolani. And 
if it be for flevme, double kebulis and agarike. And 
if it be for malencoly, double ynde and sene. Þat þing 
þat purgeþ coler, purgeþ blode. [\f. 54v\] A profitable salt 
and a þing þat purgeþ alle humours of a mannes hede, and 
it is gode for akyng of ioyntis, and for þe potagre, and 
for þe dropesy, and is þus made: Take of salt armoniac, 
of cost, xii oz.; of blacke pepir, oz. v; of comyn, of 
gynger, of white pepir, of fenel, of canel, of eueriche 
yliche moche, dr. iii; of clowes, of zedwale, of galengal, 
of quibibis, of cardamomum, yliche moche, dr. iii; of 
ysope, of tyme, of origanum, of carewey, of anees, of 
marche, of parsil, of louage, ana (of eueriche), oz. 
1 & 1/2. Make of al þes a poudir and vse it instede of 
salt with þi metis. And if þou wilt make it a laxatif, 
caste þerto dr. ii of scamonie and drinke it with meþe. 
Anoþir good salt þat purgeþ þe hede, and bynemeþ þe 
derkenes of þe y3en, and it doeþ awey þe ache of þe 3eeris, 
and [\f. 55\] is good for þe palesy: Take of salt armoniake, 
oz. vi; of diagredii and euforbie, oz. i; of pepir, gynger, 
comyn, fenel, anees, marche, ameos, lovage, cardamomum, 
|P_10 
parseli, of eueriche, oz. i And make poudir of hem 
and 3eue þe seke þerof on morwetide dr. iii with wyne 
or with meþe. 
 
And if þou wilt make delicat purgacions for hem 
þat ben norisshid in delitis, make hem in forme of watir 
and 3eve hem to drinke. Take an herbe þat is callid 
elleborus niger, and squinantum, and esula, and seene, 
and seþe hem in wiyn, and distille þat wyn into watir, 
and vse þat to purge þe of malencoly. 
 
Also sugir of borage is good in euery greuance 
of malencoly, and it is made of borage floures like-wiys 
as sugir roset is made of rooses. And oken apples soden 
in wiyn [\f. 55v\] maken þe wiyn medicinable forto destroie corrupte 
humours and smokes þat ben in a mannes hede. 
 
[\Chapter I, Part 3 
Frenzy\] 
Frenesy is a brenyng postem in þe foreparty of a 
mannes brayn or in þe skynnes of þe brayn. And sum postem 
is of corrupte blode, and sum of corrupt colere, and sum 
of boþe togedir. Comen signes, þat folowen þis sikenes 
is: moche waking, and lacking of good witt, wreeþ and 
wodenes, and sodeyn risinggis vp, and sodeyn fallinggis 
dovne. 
 
But if it is of colere, þese ben be tokenes: grete 
wille to fi3te and to smyte, drines of þe mouþe, blacknes 
of þe tonge, myche sharpe and bitter ache, and moche 
|P_11 
stering of þe hert. And his pisse is swarte rede and 
his y3en ben swollen. 
 
But þe tokenes of blood [\f. 56\] is a clene colour of þe 
visage. Þei lacken hir wit and þreten men and mysseien 
hem. And þei ben aboute to pullen oute strees and stickis 
of þe wowes. But if it be not a very frenesy but is 
comen of sum oþer postem, as of þe stomake or of þe breest, 
þen þese ben þe tokenes: a grete pouse, and a swifte, 
and a þick; and þe vrin is white and þinne. Þe cause 
þerof is, for þe hote colerik mater þat shulde make þe 
vryn reed and shulde com donward with þe vryn, and it 
passeþ vpward into þe heed and þat makeþ a man frentike. 
And þis sikenes oþirwhiles is a sikenes bi himselfen, 
oþirwhiles it foloweþ annoþir sikenes. If it is a sikenes 
bi himsilf, it may [\f. 56v\] be þus y-holpen. First lett him 
rubbe softly þe soles of his fete with vynegre and wiyn 
and salte. And if he mowen not wel take a purgacion 
for his heed, make a clistre in þis wise: Take þe hocke 
and þe holy-hock, waxe, cene, fenel, salt, and mercury, 
and seeþ al þes in watir. And aftir þey ben soden, streyne 
hem and put to hem hony and oyle. And let þe seke resceyve 
it by his fundement. Aftirward shaue his heed and leie 
þerto a warme plastir of coolde herbis to dryue awey þe 
smoke þat comeþ to þe brayn. Aftir þis is doon, if 
|P_12 
it nedeþ, take a 3onge whelpe and slit him a-two. And 
caste awei þe guttis and ley it al hoot to þe fore-hede 
And when he is coolde, ley to anoþir, for þe moo þat 
þou ley to, þe bettir it is. But [\f. 57\] if tou hast but oon 
when he is coolde, put hote watir in him and ley him to 
eftsones. Aftirward take oz. i of popilion, and dr. i of 
opium, and dr. ii of henbane, and dr. iii of blacke popi 
And poudir hem and medle hem with popilion, and with 
þe mylke of a woman þat fedeþ a meide childe, and with 
þe iuse of syngreen. And make þerof a plastir and ley 
it warme on þe heed ny3e his foreheed. And if his sleep 
a-swagid his foly, it is a good token. And ellis, it 
is yuel. And wasshe his heed with þe iuse of marche 
and with vynegre, or with oyle of roses, or with þe iuse 
of solatre, or with iuse of marche and oile of rooses 
And let him kepe cilence and speke not. And lete him 
be let blode in þe v[{e{]yne þat is in þe myddil of þe 
foreheed. And let him streyne his neck [\f. 57v\] þe while with 
a towal. And if he blede not ynowe, take a watir leche 
and kit of his taile, and do him in þe myddil of his 
foreheed above þe nose or on þe templis bisidis þe y3en 
And let him soke oute þe blood til he haue sokid as moche 
as a blode-letting is. And if he is not holpe bi al þis 
doyng, take þe iuse of letuse and of portulake, and medle 
|P_13 
hem with oyle of rooses or of violet, and a dramme and 
an half of opium. And anoynte þerwiþ his templis and his 
forheed. And if litarg[{i{]e comeþ to a frentike man, it is 
a token of deeþ. But if þe frenesi come to him þat haþ þe 
litarg[{i{]e, it is a good token. And it is profitable to 
strawe his house wiþ colde herbis and to make colde 
[\f. 58\] watir to renne ny3he his chambre. And in euery sikenes 
if it be ful grevous in þe begynnyng, worche with stronge 
medicyns. And if þe sikenes be easi, bigynne with esy 
medicynes. 
 
[\Chapter I, Part 4 
Mania\] 
Mania is an-oþer sikenes of þe myddil party of þe 
brayn and comeþ of a postem in þat parti. But oþirwhiles 
it is a sikenes himsilf, and oþirwhiles it foloweþ anoþir 
sikenes. And summe comeþ of blood, and sum of coler, and 
sum of malencoly. But of clene flevme it comeþ neuermore, 
for flevme is white as þe brayn is and þerfor it may not 
appeiren it. And if it comeþ of blood, þe greuauce is with 
lawghing. And if it be of coler, it is with a fers wodenes. 
[\f. 58v\] And if it be of malencoly, it is with moche drede. 
And if it is of coler and malencoly medlid togedir, he 
lawgheþ and fi3teþ togedir. And so if it is of oþer 
humours, it haþ þe propirtees of þo humours. But comonly 
þo þat han þis sikenes of malencoly, þei han moche sorowe, 
and dreden myche of þing þat is not to drede, and þenken 
|P_14 
on þing þat is not to þenke on. And hem semen þat þei 
seen dredeful þingis when þei seen no-þyng. And hem semen 
þat þei seen blacke develis eiþir monkis þat shulden slee 
hem. And sum wenen þat hevene wole falle dovne on hem 
and sum þat þe erþe wole falle vndir hem. And þei han 
myche desire aftir lechis [\f. 59\] and aftir medicynes. And when 
þei han hem, þei 3eue litil feieþ to hir wordes. And þei 
desiren to be in derke placis and bi hemsilfen. But 
þo þat han þis sikenes of blood loven to walke aboute 
ryvers, and in þe feldis, and in fair gardens, and in 
li3t placis. And þei loven compeny and myrþe. And if hem 
lackiþ suche þing, hem semen þat þei ben ny3e deed. But 
þo þat han it of coler loven wrastlyngis, and fi3tingis, 
and lepingis, and oþer dedes of hardynes, and crieng, and 
myche noise, and suche oþir þingis. 
 
And if þis sekenes be of coler or of blood, it is y-holpen 
as þe frenesy eiþir þe heed-ache þat comeþ of heet. 
But if it is of malencoly, he muste leve [\f. 59v\] malencolious 
metis and vsen metis þat ben moiste, as fisshe, an ripe 
fruytis, and borage, and suche oþer, and herbis þat ben 
inscisif, as calament, and herbis þat ben dissolutif, as 
fenel and parsily. But he shal not euermore vse moiste 
metis, lest his blode be corrupte and his complexion 
appeirid be þerbi. And þes erbis ben profitable for hem: 
|P_15 
arage, letuse, spinage, betis, purslane, oynons, carses, 
carloke, anet, fenel, mynte, calament. And þes metis 
þat ben moiste ben profitable, as lambren, and kiddis 
of oon 3eer, and sooking beestis, and hennes, and chekenes, 
and partriche, and suche oþer; also fisshes of ryvers 
smale and grete, and þe fyss[{h{]es þat ben not fat, ne 
fisshes of stony placis. And let him vse his metis y-di3t 
[\f. 60\] wiþ gynger, and cardamomum, and saffron, and clowes, 
and coliandre, and carewei, and comyn. And let him blede 
in þe necke-pitte. And comforte him with myrþe to do 
awei his heuynes. And if þei fomen at hir mouþ as a 
wode dogge þat were y-bete, it is a token of deeþ withyn 
vii dayes. And if he castiþ moche and volatiþ boþe mete 
and drinke, and þat litil þat he resceyueþ stondeþ him 
but in litil profite, ne he may not suffre hete of þe 
sunne ne of þe fyer, ne he may not slepe but litil and 
lieþ doun-ri3t, þes ben þe tokenes of deeþ. And if he 
haue not þes signes, 3yue him pillules made of wiyn drastis 
and of whete flour whan he is fasting. Also take of anyse, 
oz. i; of parsely, oz. iiii; of pepir, oz. iiii; of epityme 
[\f. 60v\] þat is þe flour of tyme, oz. iii; mel, quasi semis; 
and 3yue it him wiþ watir. And euery-þing þat is good 
for þe feuer quarteyn is good for þis sekenes. And in 
euery sekenes and lesing of a mannes witte aftir his 
|P_16 
purgacion, let him be cuppid in þe two neþir sidis of þe 
hede a litil aboue þe necke, eiþir bitwene þe two shuldir-bladis. 
And in euery lesyng a mannes witte, make him a 
clistre in þe begynnyng of mynte, and rwe, and suche 
oþir þingis. And it profiteþ to suche men to baþen hem 
oþirwhiles, but to dwelle þerin a litil while. And a 
special medicyn [\f. 61\] for þis sikenes is lapis armenicus y-3oven 
in pillulis eiþir in decoccions, y-wasshe eiþir 
vnwasshe, but vnwasshe it wole make a man to caste. And 
if alle þese medicyns helpiþ him not, þe laste remedy is 
to slitte þe skyn and open þe skulle. 
 
[\Chapter I, Part 5 
Lethargy\] 
Litargye is a sekenes þat makeþ a man so fo3eteful, 
þat when he haþ do a þinge, he ne haþ no mynde tat he did 
it. And þis sekenes comeþ oþirwhiles of to moche corrupte 
fleume in a mannes hede, oþirwhiles of a posteme þat is in 
þe hyndir parte of a mannes hede þer-as his mynde is. 
And if it be a postem, þes ben þe tokenes: a continuel 
fever, myche sleep, for3etefulnes. [\f. 61v\] When þei ben clepid, 
vnneþe þei wolen answere. And when her mouþ is opened, 
vnneþe þei moun close it. And þis sekenes is called 
a coolde frenesy. But if it comeþ of flevme, þes ben þe

putte þerto a litil wexe and ley it on his hede warme. 
Also oyle of castorie, and oyle of piretre, and oyle

Epilepsy\] 
Epilencie is þe falling yvel, and it comeþ of a 
moyste humour þat fulfilliþ þilke placis of þe hede þat 
shullen be voyde, and stoppiþ þe hyndre parte of þe hede 
þer-as is þe begynnyng of þe sekenes, and febliþ þe senewis 
And þerfor when þe accesse of þis sikenes comeþ to man, 
it makiþ him for a tyme to leese his felyng [\f. 65\] and his 
mevyng. Oþirwhiles þis sikenes comeþ of humours þat ben 
in þe hede, and þan it is clepid epilencie; and oþirwhiles 
of fumes þat comen into þe heed oute of his seeke and 
feble stomake, and þanne it is callid analempsie. And 
|P_21 
oþirwhiles it comeþ of greuaunce of oþir membris, and 
þanne is it callid cathalempsie. But of epilencie þer 
ben ii kyndes, þe more and þe lasse. In þe more epilencie, 
þe principal places of þe brayn ben al-togedir y-stoppid. 
Wherefore in her accesse, þei felen no-þing, and þei 
fomen at her mouþe, and al her bodi qwakiþ, and it is ful 
harde to helen hem. In þe lasse epilencie, þe principal 
placis ben y-stoppid, but not al-togedir [\f. 65v\], and þerfore 
in her accesse þei felen sum-what, and al þe bodi ne 
qwakiþ not, but þe hyndre parti of þe heed. And in 
epilencie, tremblyng of þe bodi is an yuel signe, but 
in þe palesie it is a good signe. Fomyng here is a good 
signe, but in appoplexie it is an yvel signe. And þe 
ofter þat þei fallen dovn and risen vp soon a3en, þe 
bettir signe it is and þe raþir þei movn be y-heelid. 
And if þe sekenes be of þe humours þat ben in þe heed, 
þese ben þe tokenes: hevynes of þe heed and confusion 
of her wittes, slouþe, dymnes of þe y3en, bitinge of her 
tunge, and her pisse, and her kynde, and her dritte passen 
awey fro hem a3enes her wille, and so þei fallen doun 
[\f. 66\] and mown feel no-þing, and namely in þe grettir epilencie. 
And if þis sekenes be of flevme, þou maist knowe it by 
þe tokenes of fleume, as by softenes, and whitnes, and 
slouþe and myche slepe. And if it be of malencoly, 
|P_22 
þou maist knowe it by blackenes, and lennes, and oþer 
tokenes of malencoly. If it be of hem boþe togedir, 
þe tokenes ben y-medlid togedir. 
 
Analempsy comeþ of a fume or of a smoke of þe stomake 
[{þat is{] malencolike. The tokenes herof ben abhominacion 
to mete and to drinke, tremblyng of þe herte, pricking 
of þe stomake, and flevmatike metis and malencolious 
metis doeþ hem harme. And oþirwhiles [\f. 66v\] þey fallen not, 
but ben ful feble aboute þe tyme of her acces. And þeir 
sekenes may be of flevme, of coler, and of malencolye. 
Of whiche of hem it is, þou maist knowe by þe signes of þe 
humours. 
 
Cathalmepsie comeþ of a venemous smoke þat comeþ 
from fer into þe heed and þer he is coolde. And þis 
smoke comeþ of a blood þat is bri3te and brenyng in summe 
partie of a mannes body. And þerfore it makiþ a man ful 
hoot withouteforþe and to haue a swifte breþing. And 
it afraieþ ful moche his y3en and oftentymes makiþ him 
to sowne. And he haþ oþirwhiles a feuere þerwiþ. And 
if he be callid in þe tyme of his acces, he 3eueþ noon 
answere. And if he speke, it greueþ him soor. [\f. 67\] And his 
y3en watren and ben ri3t soor and he haþ an hote swete 
in þe delyuerance of his axes. And his breþe stynkiþ 
oþirwhiles. And if eny of þes þre maneris fomen moche 
|P_23 
white fome when þei ben y-fallen a-dovne, and streynen her 
teeþ togedir, þen it is of flevme. And if he closiþ 
his y3en as þoughe he slepte and fomeþ no-þing, but ariseþ 
vp soone, þen it is of coler. But if he wexiþ blacke, 
and turneþ asidis his mouþ, and streyneþ his handis togedir, 
and lieþ stille as þoughe he were deed, and fomeþ but 
litil, þen it is of malencoly. 
 
Men þat han epilencie or analempsie shullen be dietid 
with metis þat ben temperat coolde. And þes metis ben 
good for hem: hennes, feisantis, and partriches, and 
suche [\f. 67v\] oþer, and shalid fisshe, and also borage, and 
parsely, and fenel, and good clere wiyn of Gasqwyn, but if 
it be for hem þat han cathalempsie. And let hem absteyne 
hem fro malencoolies metis, as beef and al maner of caulwortis, 
fro benes and peses, and mylke and oþir white 
metis, and fro betis, and marche, and oþir salt metis, 
and also fro rostid or fried, and from watir foules, 
and fysshes of myry watris, and from hertis fleisshe, 
and shepes fleisshe, and swynes fleisshe, and from notis 
and applis, and barliche brede and rye bred, and from 
baþing, and cumpanye of wymen, and from wreeþ and crieng. 
 
And 3yue him þat haþ þis sekenes oximel squillitike, 
or oximel of radiche, or þis oximel þat now foloweþ to 
defie þe mater of his sekenes: Take þe seedis of pyonye, 
|P_24 
and sauge, wormod, neteles [\f. 68\], horehone, lauendre, auence, 
carses, and seen. Make of þes oximel likewise as þou 
makist þes oþir oximellis. And put to þis oximel þe seedis 
þat breken þe stoon. But to hem þat han cathalempsie, 
put borage, and ypericon, and cuscute, and epithyme. 
An-oþer oximel: Take þe poudir of euforbe, and 
staphie, and peretre, and puliol, and suche oþir, and 
seeþ hem in vynegre and wiyn. And aftir make vp þin 
oximel. 
 
Aftir al þis, 3yue him a purgacion: Take alloes, 
þe wilde gorde þat is clepid in Latin collaquindida, 
bdellie, opoponac, eleborus niger, gumme arabike, of 
eueriche, oz. ii; of euforbe, oz. 1/2. Make of þes 
pillulis with þe iuse of horehovne. Also lapis armenicus 
is good for him þat haþ þis sekenes. And aftir foure 
daies, let him blede at þe hede veyne. And if he haue 
moche blode, let [\f. 68v\] him be garsid and y-cuppid on þe 
necke. 
 
A good pocion: Take a porcion of sauge, of pyony in 
lasse quantite þen of sauge, of castorye lesse þen of piony, 
of antimonye lesse þen of castorie. 
 
Anoþir: Take opoponac, castore, sandragun, antimonie, 
of eueriche yliche moche, and 3yue þe seke in what maner 
þou wilt. 
|P_25 
Special þingis for þis sikenes ben, crowes eiren 
y-eten, antimonie, piony, and ysope y-ete or y-dronke. 
For children: Piony and ysope ben beste herbis, to hange 
pyony aboute þeir neckis, and to 3eue hem ysope to ete or 
to drinke. 
 
Whan a man is fallen doune by þe falling yvel, sle 
a dogge and 3eue him þe galle to drinke. And he shal 
not falle nomore of þis sekenes. And let him bere rwe 
alwey in his honde and oftentymes smelle þerto. Anoþer: 
3yue [\f. 69\] him in drinke antimonye, castorie, olibanum, 
houndistonge, fenel root, of eueriche yliche moche. 
Anoþir, when he falliþ dovne, 3eve him to drinke of 
valerian, of sanicle and of rwe, and he shal neuer haue it 
more. 
 
A sirup for þis sekenes: Take þe seed of pyony, and 
sage, wormod, nettelis, and horehoune, and seeþ hem in 
wiyn. Or ellis clarifie þe iuse and wiyn y-medlid togedir 
with þe white and þe shellis of eggis ouer an esy fier. 
And aftir it is clensid, 3yue him to drinke. Thus þou 
shalt clarifie al maner iuse of herbis, with þe white and 
shellis of eggis. And if þe seke be costif, 3yue him of 
watir of a clisterie þat centorie, and anet, and camemyl, 
and mellilot ben y-soden yn, or make him a biting 
suppository. [\f. 69v\] An oynement for þis sekenes, and if a man 
|P_26 
haue þe epilencie, þou shalt anoynte his rigge-boon; and 
if it be analempsie, þou shalt anoynte his wombe before þe 
stomake; and if it be catalempsie, þou shalt anoynte þe 
membre fro whom þe sekenes comeþ: Take of castore, oz. ii; 
of piretre, of oyle de bay, of staphyne, of euforbe, of 
eueriche of þes, oz. i & 1/2; of syneuey, nytre, pepir, of 
eueriche, oz. i; of oyle and waxe, quantum sufficit. 
 
Anoþer onement: Take hondistonge, planteyn, betes, 
souffri watir þat brymston is medled wiþ, as watir of 
hoot baþes or oþir watir þat begynneþ to seþe, and put in 
þis watir fenel, louage, sisymbre, violet, centrum-galli, 
sage, and oold sowes grees, and lete it seþe a good while. 
Aftir it is wel y-soden, gader al þat þat hoveþ aboue 
[\f. 70\] þe watir and anoynte him þerwiþ. And vndirstond þat 
bitter medicynes been good for þe heed and for þe stomake, 
and speciali þo þat han myche of alloes. Also let hem 
þat han þe epilencie ete bytymes, for fasting is yuel for 
hem, and loking in glas, and yuel smellis and stinkes, but 
if it be of rwe, or castore, or amoni, or of antymony. 
And loking on gith y-poudrid wole make hem falle doun 
anoon. But to loke on gite hool doeþ hem good, and it 
wole make hem to rise vp soon. But to hem þat [{han{] 
analempsie, it is good to faste, if [{her he{]dis be not 
feble. It is good f[{or hem þat{] han epilencie to be let 
|P_27 
blood [{on þe{] veyne þat is bitwene þe þomb[{e and þe 
fin{]gir þat is nexte him. 
 
An [{oyle þat dis{]solueþ coolde humour[{s and wastiþ{] 
[\f. 70v\] hem is þus made: Take a povnd of lorel leves, of Englisshe 
rwebarbe, and lauriole, ana, libra i, and stampe hem and 
þen seþe hem in a povnd of wiyn and in a povnd of oyle. 
And seeþ hem so long, til þat þe wiyn be wastid. In 
epilence, anoynte her hedes with þis oyle; in analempsie 
her stomake; in cathalempsie, þe place þat þe sekenes 
comeþ fro. And þis oyle is also good for aking of þe 
heed þat comeþ of coold, and for [{þ{]e palesye, and for þe 
crampe þat comeþ [{of{] plente of humours aboute þe senewis, 
and for cold govtis. 
 
[\Chapter I, Part 7 
Apoplexy\] 
[{A{]poplexie is a sekenes þat com[{eþ o{]f stopping of 
þe principal pla[{cis þat b{]en in a mannes brayn þrow 
[{sum co{]rrupte humour. And þis [{sikenes b{]ynemet a mannes 
wit [\f. 71\] and his felyng for þe tyme and al maner meving 
wiþouteforþe, saaf only breþing. Ther ben þre kyndes of 
þis sikenes, a more, and a lasse, and a mene bitwene hem 
two. The more sleeþ a man þe first day, for it is 
incurable. The meen sleeþ a man withyn þre daies, or ellis 
turneþ into a palesie; þe lasse withyn vii daies, or turneþ 
into palasie. And þis sikenes comeþ of moche flevme or of 
moche corrup blode þat filliþ þe principal places of a 
|P_28 
mannes brayn. And if it be in so grete plente þat it 
filliþ al þe brayn, þen it makeþ a man to leese his wittis 
as his sy3te, his hering, his tasting, his smelling, and 
his meving also. Þis is þe more apoplexie. But if þe 
humour stoppe not but þe hyndre [\f. 71v\] place of þe brayn þer-as 
þe senewes han her begynnyng, þan it bynemeþ not a mannes 
wittis, but his meving. And þis is þe lasse apoplexie. Þe 
meen is þe more violent þen is þis, but not so violent 
as þe grete. And þis sikenes falliþ to fleumatike men, 
or to men þat han to moche blode, and lyven in moche ease, 
and eten moche, and drinken moche, and waisshen moche, and 
kemben moche her heed. And þis sikenes is y-knowe by 
certeyn signes as oþir sikenessis ben, as by heuynes of þe 
heed, and stronge breþing, and aking of þe heed withouten 
eny encheson or cause, a feuer, slouþe, turnyng of þe 
brayn, deerkenes of si3t. And if it is of blood, þe face 
is rody, and pale if it is of fleume. Þe face is 3elow or 
blacke if it is of malencoly. [\f. 72\] And mysturnyng of þe face, 
also falling dovne to grounde, is a grete token. But þat 
comeþ in epilencie and in sekenes of þe herte þat is 
callid syncopis. But þoughe falling a-doun be a token of 
al þes sekenessis, it is not in oon maner in hem alle. 
For in apoplexie, man wexiþ reed when he is y-falle. 
And his veynes swellen aboute his templis and his y3en, 
|P_29 
and þoughe his y3en ben open, he seeþ no-þing. And he 
fomeþ at his mouþe, but þat is a token of deeþ. And his 
axes dureþ longe, as a day or two. In epilencie, summe 
partis of þe man han þe crampe and is y-turned aside. 
And his body trembliþ and qwakeþ, and oþirwhiles he 
fomeþ, and þat is a good token, and þat his axes is ny3e 
doon. Falling of syncopis is wiþ discoleryng of þe face. 
And he lyeþ as þoughe he were deed, withouten crampe and 
withouten [\f. 72v\] tremblyng and fomyng also. And soon he riseþ 
vp. Apoplexie þat comeþ in þe waxyng of [{þe{] moone is 
incurable, and namely if it be þe more apoplexi. But if it 
comeþ in þe wanyng of þe moone, it is not so greuous. And 
if he desireþ diuerse metis, and as soon as he seeþ hem, he 
haþ abhominacion of hem, it betokeneþ deeþ. And if he 
haþe not suche tokenes, he may be y-holpen by medicynes. 
And if it be of blode, let hem blede in þe heed veyne 
of þe arme, if he be of stronge complexion. And þat 
is a souereigne remedy in eche apoplexie, of what humour 
þat it be. If þe body be ful of humoures and if it be 
of eny oþir humour þan of blode, let his body be purgid 
wiþ stronge medicynes, as with iera [{a{]logodion, or 
iera pigra, or theodoricon [\f. 73\], or stomaticon, or with 
þes pillules if it be of fleume or malencoly: Take 
of alloes and of euforbe yliche moche, and medle hem 
|P_30 
with þe iuse of like. And make of hem pillulis and 3yve 
þe seeke. And if he be feble þat he may not be let blode, 
ne haue siche stronge purgacion, let his hede be schaue. 
And make a plastir of syneuei and of vynegre, and medle 
þerwith castor and euforbe, and ley it on his heed. 
 
Anoþir good plastir: Take femygreke and whete 
bran, and seþe hem in a litil wiyn. Also let þe heed 
be anoyntid with hote oynementis y-made of euforbe, castor, 
piretre; or þe iuse of marche and euforbe y-medlyd togedir; 
or þe iuse of rwe, of carses, and of sauge y-medlyd with 
þe oþer. [\f. 73v\] And if þe greuaunce falle doun in þe chyne, 
let him be anoyntid with þe same oynementis vppon þe 
cheyne. And þen let him be waisshid with þe watir þat 
camemyl, mellilot, anet, sansuke, ben y-soden yn. And 
make a plastir of þe iuse of centory, and of netles, 
and of saalt, and ley to þe hyndre party of þe heed. 
And if he be costiffe, make him a clistir þat is sharpe 
and biting, of hocke leeues and betes soden in watir. 
And put hony and oyle þerto. And let his fondement be 
anoyntid with bolles galle. Or make him a suppository of 
nytre, dr. ii; of castor, dr. 1/2; of scamone, and hony 
þat sufficeþ þerto. Or make a suppository of white sope 
þat is harde, and anoynte it with bolles galle and with 
salte. Blacke soope and white soop ben good for brenyng 
|P_31 
[\f. 74\] or scalding, so þat it lye þer-vppon þre or iiii houres 
anoon aftir þe hurting. And þei also ben good for scabbis 
and forto opene þe pooris of þe skynne, and it makiþ þe 
skynne white. 
 
Also in worching of þis sekenes and of alle oþer, 
begynne with esy medicyns and aftirwarde with strengir. 
And when he greneþ, put a wegge bitwene his teeþ to holde 
his mooþe open. And robbe his mooþ with tostid brede 
þat is y-wette in þe iuse of myntis. And make him to 
smelle to a gootis horne þat is y-brent. But alle þes 
medycyns shullen be doon in þe lasse apoplexie and not 
in þe more, for þat is incurable. And þei muste be dietid 
with hoot metis and drinkis. And in passing awey of þis 
sikenes, good wyn is good for hem. And vndirstonde 
[\f. 74v\] þat a feuer is profitable in þis sikenes, and in þe palesy 
also, and þe crampe þat is in replecion of blode. And 
þou maist make þat in þis wise: Ley þe seke man bitvixte 
two good fyres and 3yue him to drinke good stale ale. 
And let him ete garlike a good quantite and aftirward 
drinke a gode drau3te of stronge and fresshe wiyn, so 
þat it be warmed. And put þeryn a gode quantite of pepir. 
And anoynte al his body with oyle de bay or of lorer

poudir þat noieþ þe i3en, and oþirwhiles it comeþ of 
humours þat fallen doun into þe i3en, as of blode, of 
coler, of fleume, or of malencoly. And if it be of blood 
þes ben þe tokenes: reednes of þe i3en, and hete, and 
swelling, with moche heuynes boþe of þe i3en and also 
of þe forehede. And also þe i3en ben moyste and weping. 
And whan þe liddes ben y-closid, þei felen moche [\f. 75v\] sharpenes 
wiþynforþe, as þoughe þer were grauel in her y3en. And 
her face is ful of blode. 
 
Of coler, þes ben þe tokenes: redenes of þe y3en 
|P_33 
þat is not a cleer redenes as is þat þat comeþ of blode, 
but a maner brovn-rede. And þei ben hote and smerting: 
grete ache and greuaunce wiþouten swelling of þe i3en. 
But if it be of flevme, þer is more swelling and lasse 
ache. And þe watir þat flowiþ on ny3tis-tyme fro þe 
y3en is viscouse as bridlym, and makeþ hem sumwhat blere-y3ed. 
And her y3eliddis cleuen togedir, and þei felen 
moche heuynes and greuaunce in her y3en. And if þe ache 
comeþ of malencoly, þe i3en swellen but litil, ne þei 
ben not ful hoot ne ful rede. And þe humour þat comeþ 
fro hem waxit [\f. 76\] harde and is of mene colour, not ri3t 
white ne ri3t brovn. Oþirwhiles þe ache of þe i3en comeþ 
of þe browis and of sum humour þat is in hem. Of what 
humour þat it is, þou maist knowe bi þes foreseide tokenes. 
 
Also ache of þe y3en comeþ oþirwhiles from þe stomake. 
And þe ache is grettir aftir mete þen bifore. And if it 
comeþ of colde humours þat ben in þe stomake, let him 
caste and brake aftir mete. And vse purgacions þat serven 
to þe humour þat makiþ þe ache. And oþirwhiles þe 
greuaunce of þe i3en comeþ of rewme of þe hede. þan 
hele þe hede of þat rewme and þe y3en shal be hool. 
 
And forto auoide þis rewme, pillules of diacastor 
ben good and ben þus y-made: Take of castor, of 
mirabolani, of eche of hem, [\f. 76v\] dr. iii; of muske, a greyn 
|P_34 
and an halfe; of alloes, dr. i; of ase, myrre, euforbe,

boþe of þe more and of þe lasse, agarike, mastike, sal 
armoniac, zedoare, anisi, of eche of þes, sc. i and ix 
greynes; of saturey, ysop, camedreos, pileol mounteyn,

caperis, of eche, xi greynes; of anacardi, sauyn, gencian, 
of þe ryndes of mandrake, of eche, xi greynes; of 
peusadanum, wormod, of eche, vii greynes; of yreos, xiii 
greynes and þe þirde parte of halfe an handful. And 
make herof pillulis of þe quantite of a notte. Þese 
ben gode for þe greuaunce of þe hede, and for þe palesy, 
and for þe lyuer, and þe splene, and þe reynes, and for 
al colde sekenes. But for þe greuaunce of þe y3en þat 
comeþ of rewme, þou shalt put of þes pillulis in wiyn 
and put þat in þin noseþrillis. And take poudir of 
|P_35 
piretre, and staphizagre, and mastik and chewe hem in 
þi mooþ. Or mylte hem with wexe and þen leie it on a 
lynen [\f. 77v\] cloþe to þy forehede, for it dissolueþ þe flevme, 
and drieþ þe brayn, and clereþ þe si3te. And anoynte 
þe forehede with oile of lorer or of piliol, or ellis 
make a serid clooþ, and of þe poudre of mastike, and 
of olibanum, and citre, and wax y-put þerto and hony. 
Or let hem blede on þe cop of þe nose. Or let him baþe 
him, or make a stwe with hoot herbis. And make him suche 
a purgacion as Y tolde in þe sekenes of þe hede. 
 
But if þe ache of y3en be of blode, let him blede 
at hede veyne of þe arme, or let him be cuppid or garsid 
in þe necke-pitte, or bitwene þe two shuldris. And if 
it be of coler, 3yve him a colog[{og{]e, þat is to sey, 
a medicyn þat may clense him and purge him of coler, 
as mirabolani citri, [\f. 78\] or oximel y-made with colde herbis, 
or an electuarie made with þe iuse of roses and oþir 
colde þingis, or pillulis þat ben y-made of þe fyue kyndes 
of mirabolani. And aftir his purgacion, ley þe medicyns 
to his y3en. 
 
Dieting of suche men shal be as of men þat han þe 
feuer tercian. And let hem absteyne hem fro wiyn and 
al fried metis, and rostid metis, and salt metis, and 
biting metis, and soure metis. And let hem be in derke 
|P_36 
placis. And whan þei slepen, let þeir hedis lye hi3e. 
And her metes muste be suche þat may be li3tli defied, 
and her drinke smale, þat is, stale and clere, or as 
smale as watir. 
 
Special medicyns for ache of y3en þat comeþ 
hete, as of blode þat is [\f. 78v\] hote and moyst, or of coler 
þat is hote and drye, þei muste be colde forto be, 
mytigat[{i{]ues, þat is to sey, to aswage þe violence of 
þe ache. And þey must be colde to be repercussyues, 
þat is to sey, to smyten a3en fro þe y3e þe humour þat 
is cause of þe ache. And þes two kyndes of colde medicyns 
han þei, þat ben, mytigatiues and repercussiues. But Y 
wole not þat þou vse alwei mytiga[{ti{]ues and repercussiues, 
but oþirwhile dissolutiues, þat is to sey, hote medicyns 
þat mowen dissolue þe mater of þe sekenes ri3t as þe 
hete of þe sunne dissolueþ yis or snowe into watir. Ne 
Y wole not þat þou vse euermore dissolutiues, but 
oþirwhilis confortatives to comforte þe y3e, for if hote 
medicyns eiþir to colde weren y-leide to þe y3e 
contynueliche, þei shulde hurte [\f. 79\] þe y3e as moche as þe 
ache doiþ. And so it fareþ of eueriche ache where-þat-euer 
it be in a mannes bodi. And þerfore in þe begynnyng 
of þe ache, thou shalt 3eue confortatiues to comforte 
þe membre þat akiþ, for but if þe membre be stronge forto 
|P_37 
worche himsilfe, þe strengþe of þe medicyn shal but litil 
auaile: Þe medicyn is but an helper and þe principal 
is þe membre þat is seke. And þerfore it nediþ to haue 
confortatiues in þe begynnyng þat ben neiþir ful hote ne 
ful colde. And in þe waxyng of þe sekenes and whan þe 
sekenes is most greuous, let him vse medicyns þat ben 
confortatiues and dissolutives y-medlid togedir. And in þe 
passing [\f. 79v\] awey of þe sekenes, þou shalt vse dissolutiues. 
 
But þou muste vndirstonde þat of þes medicyns, sum 
ben symple and sum ben componed. Simple medicyns ben, as 
of oon herbe by himsilf, or of oon watir þat is y-made 
of oon herbe, or of hony, or of oyle de olif, or of oon 
gumme, or of oon spicery by him-silf. 
 
Componed medicens ben made of two þingis, or þre, 
or of meny þingis y-medlid togederis. And of simple 
medicyns, sum ben hote and dissolutiues, and sum ben colde 
and mytigatiues and repercussiues. Of hote medicynes þat 
ben dissolutiues, sum ben stronge dissolutiues and sum 
ben feble dissolutiues. 
 
Stronge dissolutiues ben, rede netil, rwe, celidon, 
bawme þat is an onyment, [\f. 80\] camfer, alloes, aumbir, þe 
galle of eueriche beste, euery salt, and euery-þing þat 
is ful corisiyf and freting. Þerfore suche stronge 
dissolutiues muste be medlid with esy mytigatiues or 
|P_38 
repercussiues whan þe ache is bowing aweiward. 
Feble dissolutiues ben, þe 3olke of an egge, þe 
iuse of myntes, of basilicon, of sansuke, verueyn, endiue, 
þe leues of madir, hote crommes of whete brede y-springid 
with wyne or with rose watir; also þe iuse of fenel, 
of eufrace, of hayhoue, of licium, þe iuse of sloon 
sarcacolle, acacia, muske, þe watir of a vyne, hony, 
þe blood of a coluir or of an hen or cheken, and lymail 
of golde. And whan þe ache stondiþ and neiþir waxiþ 
ne abatiþ, suche muste [\f. 80v\] be y-medlid with esy 
repercussiues. 
 
Repercussiues ben also sum ful stronge and sum ben 
feble. Stronge repercussiues ben y-clepid stupefacris, 
for þei a-stonyen a membre þoroughe her colde and so þei 
make a membre to leese boþe his ache and his felyng. 
And for þeir greet violence, þou shalt not take hem in 
þe ache of y3en ne in noon oþer ache, but if þe ache 
be þe more violent and perlouse. And suche percussiues 
ben þe rynde of mandrake and þe fruyt þerof, and also 
henbane, and morel, and orpyn, and popy sede, and nameli 
of þe blacke popi. 
 
Feble repercussiues ben y-clepid mytigatiues, for 
þei aswagen þe ache and comforten þe membre. And suche 
ben womanes mylke [\f. 81\] and asse mylke, þe white of an ey, 
|P_39 
and oile of roses, and of violet, and lynsede. Þes ben 
feble repercussiues; and portulake and þe iuse of solatre 
and syngrene, þes ben stronge repercussiues. 
 
Of componed medicyns, þer ben many þat ben profitable 
for þe ache of y3en þat comeþ of hete. Oon is þis: Take 
watir of roses, and þe white of eggis, and womanes mylke, 
and a litil white wiyn. And þerwiþ let him wasshe his 
y3en. Anoþir: Seþe fenel rotis, and violet, and popi 
sede in watir. And þerwiþ anoynte his y3en. And do 
psillie in watir of roses and ley þat vppon his y3en 
al ny3t in þe maner of a plastir. And ley þis plastir 
on his templis: Take roses, anyse, and ceruse þat is 
clepid blank plum and white lede, and sandragon, and 
[\f. 81v\] gumme arabike, of eueriche yliche moche, and stampe hem, 
and tempere hem with watir of roses and white of eggis 
y-made into gleir. And leie þis on his forehede and on 
his templis. And let it lye þer þre daies. 
 
Anoþir plastir: Take þe iuse of violet, and þe 
gleir of eggis, and watir of roses, and barly mele, and 
make þerof a plastir, and ley on his y3en. Or take þe 
iuse of syngreen, and womanes mylke, and þe whyit of an 
egge, and þe iuse of endyve if þou wilt, or ellis þe watir 
of roses, and medle hem togedir. And wete a cloute þeryn 
and ley vppon his y3en. 
|P_40 
Also in a grete ache of þe y3en, þou maist wasshe 
hem with warme watir þat femygreke and mellilot ben y-soden 
yn, if it is so þat þei flowen not, for if þei 
flowen, þei shalle [\f. 82\] not be wasshen with warme watir. 
But make a strictory and ley to his hede, of encense and 
barly mele, or whete mele and gleyr of eggis. But if 
his body be ful moyst and his hede be replete with humours, 
make him no strictory, but 3yue him a purgacion acording 
to þe humours þat maken þe ache and þe flowing of þe y3en. 
And whan þe flowing cesyþ or waxiþ lasse þen it was, þen 
vse repercussiues and mytigatiues. And if þe ache be ful 
violent, þen vse not only colde þingis, but medle hem 
with hote þingis so þat þe hote þingis mowen sumwhat 
dissolue þe mater of þe ache, and þe colde þingis mowen 
aswage þe violence of þe hete of þe ache. And in þe 
ende and in þe declinacion of þe ache, vse dissoutiues. 
And whan þou [\f. 82v\] wilt wasshe a mannes y3en, if his greuaunce 
encresiþ, leue it. And ellis, continue it. In a rotid 
and in an olde greuaunce of þe y3en, it is profitable 
forto be baþid in a hote baþþe, and aftirward forto drinke 
a good drau3t of malmesyn or of sum oþir gode wiyn, and 
aftir þat to take a good slepe and a soot. Also þe iuse 
of chikenmete þat haþ a rede flour and þe iuse of grapes 
þat ben not ripe ben gode. And þe iuse of planteyn and 
|P_41 
of verueyn y-medlid togedir ben also gode. And y-medlid 
with þe gleyr of eggis, it is for ychyng of þe y3en and 
forto do awei þe blode þat is in hem. And þe same doiþ 
þe crummes of an hote loof y-spreynt with þe watir of 
roses if þe ache is of hete, and if it is of colde, with 
wyin. Also licium y-medlid with womanes mylke or with 
white wiyn [\f. 83\] and y-leide on þe y3en doit awei þe ache, 
and þe ychyng, and þe blode. A plastir y-made of þe iuse 
of radiche, and of nettil seed y-stampid, and carsede, 
and mastike, and olibanum, and rye mele, if þey be plastrid 
to þe forehede, shal not suffre noon hote humour flowe 
at þe yen. And if þe y3en smerte and mowen not suffre 
fyer ne li3te, take valerian, and marche, and planteyn, 
and syngrene, of eueriche yliche moche, and take þe iuse 
of hem and medle it with soure whete brede and make 
þerof a plastir, not to harde ne to nesshe, and ley it 
colde to his y3en. But ley a þynne cloute bitwene þe 
plastir and his y3en, and in oon ny3t it shal hele him, 
þoughe þe y3en be coverid with blode. 
 
A collirie: Take of [\f. 83v\] amyde, ceruse, gumme arabike, 
dragagantum, of eueriche, dr. iii; of opium, sc. i; and 
tempere hem with þe white of eggis or with watir of roses. 
And see þat alle þe poudris þat ben y-put in colliries 
be y-beten as smale as it may ben, and aftirward y-bultid 
|P_42 
þoroughe a smale lynen clooþ y-doblid or ellis bi a farcer, 
for if it be but bostously y-bultid or farcid, þei shal 
greue þe y3en. And wasshe þe yen with watir of roses 
or eufrace, or of fenel, or with malmesyn, or whijt wiyn, 
or þou doo þy colleri into þe y3en. But if þe ache 
of þe y3en come oþirwhiles of colde, as of flevme or 
of malencoly, or ellis of þe pose, if it comeþ of þe 
pose, hele þe pose as Y shal telle in þe chaptir of þe 
pose. And if it comeþ [\f. 84\] of flevme, purge hit as Y tolde 
in þe hede-ache and in oþir sikenessis of þe hede. And 
if it be of malencoly, purge it. And aftirward let him 
be stwid ouer a stewe fyue or seuen tymes, þat is made of 
wormod, of betayn, of fenel, of sauge, of þe floris of 
tyme, of camemil floures, of mellilot floures, of hockis, 
and marche. Alle þes muste be soden in wiyn and watir 
y-medlid togederis, þe toon halfe wiyn, and te toþir 
halfe watir. And let him holde his y3en and his hede 
ouer þe stewe. And aftirward take a lynen cloþe or coton 
and wete in þe watir. And anoynte þerwiþ his y3en. And 
let him be cuppid in þe neþir parti of þe hede bihyndeforþe 
or bitwene his shuldir-bladis. Or let him blede 
on þe veyne of þe elbowe. And sette [\f. 84v\] an horne al aboute 
þe elbowe and cuppe him þer. But vndirstonde þat al þes 
blode-lettinggis shullen raþir be y-doon þer-as þe ache 
|P_43 
comeþ of hete, þen of colde. Also take rwe and hete 
it on an hote tiyl stoon, and make þerof a plastir, and 
ley it on his y3en. Or wete a lynen clooþ in þe iuse 
of rwe and of fenel and ley on his y3en. And wasshe 
his y3en in þe euen and in þe morewe in þe watir of lily 
rotis or in white wiyn þat spikenard is soden yn. Or 
ellis wasshe hem with white wiyn þat mellilotum, and popi, 
and comyn ben soden yn, or with whijt wiyn þat olibanum 
and roses ben soden yn, or with whijt wyne þat bras or 
golde han ofte ben y-qwenchid yn, or with wiyn þat gynger 
and rwe han ben soden yn, or ellis [\f. 85\] take peritorie, 
and put it in a bagge and make a plastir þerof aftir 
þe brede and þe quantite of þe y3e and ley it to colde. 
Or make a plastir of barly mele or of bran y-soden in 
white wiyn y-put in a bagge and y-leide on þe y3e, for 
þis heliþ þe ache þat comeþ of colde. Or seþe in wiyn 
femygreke mele or of lynen-sede, or of mellilotum in a 
bagge and ley it on þe y3e. A colliry: Take of licium, 
acacie, amyde, sarc[{ac{]olle, calamynt, encense, of eueriche, 
dr. i; of opium, x greynes. Tempere it wp with þe 
iuse of fenel and of eufrace. And aftir, drie it þries 
or foure siþes in þe sunne. And tempere it aftir his 
drieng in þe same iuse. And siþ drie it vp and put þerof 
in þe y3e in þe morewe and in þe [\f. 85v\] euene. And it doiþ 
|P_44 
awey hede-ache þat comeþ, of colde and heliþ blerid y3en, 
but it is sumwhat bityng. 
 
[\Chapter II, Part 2

Obtalmye is a postem in a mannes y3e þat comeþ of 
corrupte humours þat fallen a-dovn into a mannes y3e. And 
þis postum is oþirwhiles withyn, and oþirwhiles withouten. 
And in boþe places, it comeþ of blode, or of coler, or of

þe necke-pitte, or behynde þe hede in þe two hornes þat 
ioynen to þe necke. And if he be costif, 3eue him a laxe. 
And also baþing is profitable for him, and gode dieting, as

Y seyde in þe laste chaptir. And lette [\f. 86v\] him not waisshe

of oo kynde: þe cloþe is þicker þen þe web, and þe nayl

For þe web, clooþ, or nayl þat is curable, fasting,

of soure grapes, or of fenel, or in whijt wiyn. But þer ben 
þre kyndes of tuchie: whijt, rede, and blacke, and eueriche 
oon of hem is mitigatif, [\f. 89v\] and repercussif, and corrosif, but 
þe white is more repercussif in þe hete and in reednes of þe 
y3en; þe black is mitigatif; and þe rede is more repercussif. 
 
And meny of þes grete corrosiues muste be wasshen 
in diuerse þingis to abaten her malices. Calamina shal 
be xx syþes y-qwenchid in þe iuse of fenel, or in a childis 
vryn, or in a womanes mylke, or in wiyn of pomgarnad. 
Cathmia shal be ix siþes y-waisshen in gotis mylke, or 
in asse mylke, or in a womanes mylke. Alloes shal be 
ix tymes y-waisshen in þe iuse of fenel. Antimonie and 
bras y-brente in þe same maner shullen [\f. 90\] be y-qwenchid 
and y-waisshe, for þey be moste violent corrosiues. And 
aftir þeyr waisshing, þei mowon be y-put in colliries. 
 
Summe þingis ben y-waisshe to haue more violence 
þen þei hadden, as encence y-waisshe in þe iuse of celidon 
and meny oþir þingis þat seruen for oþer sekenessis by 
waisshing lesen moche of her violence, as lapis lazuli, 
and lapis armenicus, y-wasshen in watir, and spurge sede 
in oyle. And scamonie in þe iuse of planteyn is not so 
laxatif as it was tofore, ne aloes, and it be y-waisshen, 
is not so sotil and so persyng as it was. 
 
And medicyns ben oþirwhiles y-brente to encresen her 
|P_49 
[\f. 90v\] violence, as attrament and calamina. Summe ben brente to 
be þe more sotil, as a watir cankre, þat is y-3ove to men 
þat ben etike. Summe þingis ben y-brente for þei shullen 
be þe bettir y-poudrid, as syndel; summe to leesen his 
venemousnes, as a scorpion when it is taken for þe stone. 
And grettir medicynes þat ben of grete mater, þoroughe 
brenyng, þei wexen þe more violent. Sotil medicyns in 
brenyng lesen her violence, and mene medicyns þat ben notte 
ri3t sotil ne ri3t grete. But in making colliries þat ben 
corrisyues, þou muste medle with corrisiues mitigatiues and 
confortatiues, as when þei ben y-poudrid, [\f. 91\] tempre hem 
with watir of roses, or with þe iuse of planteyn, or of 
fenel, or of eufrace, or of rewe, or with þe blode 
of a lapwynge or of a swalewe. And aftir, drye hem in 
þe sunne. And do so iii or iiii tymes. And þen poudir it 
smale and bolte it þoroughe a smale clooþ. And aftir medle 
it with þe iuse of oon of þe foreseide herbis, or with 
þe blood of a capon, or of an hare, or of an ramme, or of 
a boor. And so do it in þe y3e. But see þat þy colliries 
ben not to stronge and violent, for harmyng of þe y3e. 
And if ony suche be in þe y3e, put in it anoon womanes 
mylke. And gader it [\f. 91v\] oute as clene as þou may. And 
aftirwarde ley to þe y3e mytigatiues and confortatiues, 
as dragagantum resolved in coold watir. 
|P_50 
Eiþir take þe mussilage of psillie þat is þus made: 
Take þe seed of psillie and put it in a vessel of colde 
watir. And þe watir shal wexe þicke as gely or as gleyr 
of eggis. Wringe it þoroughe a clooþ and kepe it. For 
it is callid mussilage. And in þe same maner þou may make 
mussilage of oculus Christi. Boþe ben good mitiga[{ti{]ues. 
 
A gode colliry: Take of sarcacolle, encense, gumme 
arabike, and of amyde, dr. iii; of licium, mirre, and 
ceruse, dr. ii; of alloes, tucie, roses, and of campher 
dr. i; of opium, sc. i. And when þou 3euest a [\f. 92\] man 
colliries, boþe before and aftir, anoynte þe y3en with 
watir þat roses or planteyn ben y-soden yn, in greuaunce 
þat comeþ of hete; but if it comeþ of colde, with watir 
eufrace or of fenel. In coolde causes, vse medicyns siche 
as is y-rehersid in þe laste chaptir, and þe colliries of 
þis chaptir. But or þan þou 3yue him colliries, make him a 
plastir of been mele in a bagge y-soden in wiyn, or of 
gynger and a litil hony, or of suche oþer as it tolde 
in þe laste chaptir tofore þis, and also baþing and 
strictories as it is y-tolde þer. 
 
Anoþir colliry: Take alloes, and mirre, and encense, 
calamina, ceruse, tuchia, of eueriche, yliche moche; 
[\f. 92v\] of amyde, sumwhat more; of opium, wel lasse. And make 
þerof a colliry.

[\Chapter II, Part 3 
Web, Cloth, and Nail\] 
Other sikenessis þer ben of þe y3en. Oon is a web 
or a wem þat coueriþ þe myddis of þe y3e. And þis is 
in two maners: Oþirwhilis he is whiyt and þynne, and 
oþirwhiles he is þicke, as when obtalmye is not cleen yhelid 
vp but þe rote abydeþ stille. Oþirwhiles þe web is 
not whijt, but reed eiþir blacke. But when al þe y3e is 
couerid, þen it is clepid a clooþ. And when it coueriþ 
þe oon corner of þe y3e, þen it is clepid vngula. And þis 
greuaunce comeþ of corrupte humours as obtalmie [\f. 93\] doiþ. 
And it shal be helid by corrosyues, confortatiues, 
repercussiues, mytigatiues, and strictories, and blood-lettinggis, 
like as obtalmie is y-helid. But if it comeþ 
of obtalmye or of hurting of þe y3e þat is not wel y-helid, 
þou maist vsen consolidatiues in þy colliries, 
as sarcacolle, or alloes, mirre, encense, emachites, 
sandragon, with þe whijt of an egge, or with þe iuse of 
planteyn, or with þe iuse of auence. And in þe begynnyng, 
it is good to vse mollificatiues if it be so þat þe y3en 
ben not ful moist. And aftir, worche with corrosiues, first 
with eesy, [\f. 93v\] and aftir with strengir. 
 
If it be nede of mollificatiues, take womanes mylke, 
and þe watir þat þe hocke and þe holihocke ben y-soden 
yn, and lynseed, femygreke, with þe iuse of fenel, and 
þe watir þat dropeþ of a snayl when it is wel priked. 
|P_52 
And þe beste of al is oyle of notes þat is þus maad: 
Take notes and seeþ hem in watir al hool. And aftirwarde 
breke hem, and take oute þe kernels, and stampe hem. 
And aftir þat, wringe hem þoroughe a clooþ. And þat 
oyle is a noble mollificatif. And if þe greuaunce be 
of newe, take þe iuse of chekenmete or of rede popi. And 
þat shal sufficen. Or ellis make a colliri [\f. 94\] of mirre 
alloes, licium, with þe iuse of fenel. Or take licium 
and campher and temper hem with þe iuse of fenel. And 
if þes freten not awey, take sum strengir freteris, as os 
sepie, spume of þe see, calamina, and tucie: Þat is þe 
best of hem al. Or seþe salte in vinegre and poudir it. 
And put in þe i3e, for it fretiþ awei þe web. And so 
doiþ þe iuse of celidon and of verueyn, if þe sore be newe. 
Also take a rede snayl and salte him in a bacyn. And let 
him lye so iii=e= daies. And aftir, set þe bacin a-slont 
and sidingli, þat þou may rescyue þe licour into a clene 
vessel. And close it. And take of þis watir and put in þe 
i3e. And let it be þeryn þre daies; þan do awei þe pece 
þat it haþ y-freten awei. And aftir, do oþir licour þat is 
eesi in his i3e. 
 
A good poudir to freten [\f. 94v\] awei eueriche kynde of web in 
a mannes i3e, and þoughe it be olde so þat mollificatiues 
goon before: Take of amyde, of sarcacolle, dr. ii; of 
|P_53 
roses, dr. 1/2; of tucie, dr. 1/2. Tempere hem with þe 
iuse of eufrace or fenel. And aftir, drie þat in þe sonne. 
And þan do þerof in þe i3e. And if he may not suffre it, 
medle it with þe blode of an henne, or with þe iuse of 
eufrace, or plantein, or egrimoyne, or verueyn, or endyue, 
or filago, or celidon: Þer is no better medicyn for þis 
greuaunce. 
 
And vndirstonde þat þe beste maner to make poudirs 
smale for þe i3en is to rubben hem with þe iuse of þe 
foreseide herbis, or on a barbours [\f. 95\] wheston, or in a 
clene-scourid bacyn. Also þe iuse of þe iii-leuyd gras 
þat haþ white spekis is good for þe web, and also golde or 
laton y-robbid on a wheston with vynegre til þe vynegre be 
þicke, and aftirward y-dried is gode. And it drieþ moche 
þe y3en. 
 
Poudir of lede shall þus be made: Take lede and melte 
it ouer þe fier and stere it with a grene haselne sticke. 
And it wole turne to blacke povdir, and þat is good for 
þis greuaunce. Whan þou comfortist þe y3e, comforte him 
boþe withyn and withoute. And also comforte þe stomake, 
for þat is profitable for þe y3en. And in drye y3en, vse 
moyste corosiues; [\f. 95v\] and in moyste y3en, drye corosives; in 
olde greuaunces, stronge corosiues; in newe, esy corosiues. 
For þe web in þe i3en or pyn: Take eufras and stampe it. 
|P_54 
Þen streyne it þoroughe a clooþ and lete it clere. And put 
in þe i3e of þe clere duringe þre daies at eue and at 
morwe. And he shal be hole. Probatum est.
