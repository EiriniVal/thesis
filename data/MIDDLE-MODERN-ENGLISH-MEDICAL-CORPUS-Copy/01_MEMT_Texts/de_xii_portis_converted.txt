the aire of the nature of wynter whiche aire sharpith fro fuyre 
and with the sharpyng troublith and so gendrith grevous

sharpith nature of water with whiche sharpyng therof as 
cendith suche a fumosite in the aire of whiche troubled aire 
gendren grevous passiouns whiche bien cold and moiste

with to hym the heete from fuyre and somoche of the wynter 
hoote and moiste and gendren over grete passiouns whiche bien 
propirly of veer in wynter bien forsoth hoote and moiste It 
is to be wist that the power of signes and planetis nat in 
the same maner be haven hem silf in al tymes of al therth ffor 
whi whan therth is divided in .vij. parties of the nature of 
the .vij. planetis It is to be wist that in the yeere of Capricorn 
whiche is cold and dry shalbe in somer more drie and cold in 
thoo parties of therth whiche propirte drie of his planete þat 
is to say Saturne whiche is cold and drye fforwhy whan other 
parties of therth bien cold and drye only of the nature of Capri 
corn and power that he hath in that tyme more bien moved and 
troubled than other whiche bien nat of their propirte that is to 
say signes and planetis That if the yeere of hem be nat certeyn 
therth ne hath no charge to moeve of hem but in wynter and 
this than be don bi nombre that is to say whan the planete 
is vnder or supposite to his owne propir signe Tho londis forsoþ 
whiche bien nygh the power of the mone and Cancer for the 
affynite of cold that thei han thei bryng in comocioun . 
and moevyng in their yeere nat only somoche as thei bryng in

moist so as Cancer and luna fforsoth other londis whiche bien 
neither cold ne hoote bien naturaly liefully in bryngge þe 
contrarie and conmocioun or moevyng only but a litel 
In like wise the lioun and the sonne yeven more mocioun 
[\f. 38v\] to thoo londis whiche is propirly to hem subiect than to other Thoo 
londis whiche bien subgect to libra and Aries liefully yevith nat 
commocioun as to his ovne propir lond only for the affynite of heete 
thei yeven to it the more commocioun than to other of whom thei 
han non affynite If forsoth it be the yeere of the lyoun and þe sonne 
|P_324 
as it is saide in al that yeere thei yeven commocioun of thyng 
If otherwise only thei yeven in Somer the commocioun in .iij. 
monethis and this is as it is saide bi nombre It is to be wist that 
ther is another chaunge only in therth after this that it be separat or 
departed bi playnes and mountaynes whiche sum forsoth is ny 
the sonne sum nygh the westyng or goyng doun sum nygh the 
Semptemtrioun That chaunge confermyth Ipocras and other 
philophers to come of many causes and therfor comaundith 
Ipocras that a leche busie hym and see whether the chaunge of

the passiouns comen of the nature of the lond / than shalbe 
another experiment if otherwise of evene chaunge of tymes 
naturaly and accidentaly thei comen and asken another ju

of tymes whether the passioun be substancial and þe chaunge 
accidently . or the chaunge substancial and the passioun ac 
cident Sumtyme forsoth it woneth to come to passioun cole

the chaunge of tymes differencith from his propirte lieful

 This forsoth sonner may be helid bi suche pociouns in this tyme
