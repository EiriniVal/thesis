[^QUINTE ESSENCE^] 
 
|P_1 
[\BOOK 1.\] 
[\f. 10\] 
With þe my3t, wisdom, & grace of þe holy trynite, I write 
to 3ou a tretice in englisch breuely drawe out of þe 
book of quintis essencijs in latyn, þat hermys þe prophete and 
kyng of Egipt, after the flood of Noe, fadir of philosophris, 
hadde by reuelacioun of an aungil of god to him sende, þat 
þe wijsdom and þe science of þis book schulde not perische, 
but be kept and preserued vnto þe eende of þe world, of alle 
holy men from al wickid peple and tyrauntis, for greet perilis 
þat my3te falle þerof. For wiþinne þis breue tretis, wiþ þe 
grace of god, I wole more determine of practif þan of theorik. 
3itt ben boþe nedeful The firste and souereyneste priuyte þat 
god, maker of kynde, ordeyned for mannys nede, how þat olde 
euangelik men, and feble in kynde, my3te be restorid, and haue 
a3en her firste strenkþis of 3ongþe in þe same degree þat is in 
al kynde, & be mad hool parfi3tly, except þe strok of þe 
þundir blast, & violent brusuris, and oppressynge of to myche 
betynge Also perilous fallyngis of hi3 placis, to myche abstynence, 
& oþere yuel gouernaunce a3ens kynde, And also þe 
teerme þat is sett of god, þat noman may a-schape, as Iob seiþ in 
latyn "Breues dies hominis sunt &c." Forsoþe philosophoris 
|P_2 
clepen þe purest substaunce of manye corruptible þingis elementid, 
'quinta essencia,' þat is to seie, 'mannys heuene,' drawe out 
by craft of mani; for whi, as quinta essencia superior, þat is, 
heuene of oure lord god, in reward of þe .iiij elementis, is 
yncorruptible & vnchaungeable ri3t so [\f. 10b\] quinta essencia superior 
inferior, þat is to seie, mannys heuene, is incorruptible, 
in reward of þe .4. qualitees of mannys body; and so it is 
preued naturaly þat oure quinta essencia, þat is, mannes heuene, 
in it-silf is incorruptible; and so it is not hoot and drie wiþ 
fier ne coold and moist wiþ watir ne hoot & moist with eyr, 
ne coold and drie wiþ erþe; but oure quinta essencia avayliþ to 
þe contrarie, as heuene incorruptible But vndirstonde þat oure 
qui[{n{]ta essencia is nou3t so incorruptible as is heuene of oure 
lord god; but it is incorruptible in reward of composicioun 
maad of þe .4. elementis; & it hath .iij. names by the philosophoris, 
þat is to seie brennynge watir þe soule in þe spirit of 
wyn, & watir of lijf But whanne 3e wole concelle it, þanne 
schal 3e clepe it 'oure quinta essencia'; for þis name, & þe 
nature þerof, ri3t fewe philosophoris wolde schewe but sikurly 
þei biriede þe truþe with hem. and witiþ weel that it is clepid 
brennynge watir; and it is no brennyng watir: forwhi, it is not 
moist ne coold as comoun watir; for it brenneþ, & so doiþ not 
comyn watir; ne it is nat hoot and moist as eir, for eir corrumpiþ 
a þing a-noon, as it schewiþ weel by generacioun of flies, 
& areins, and siche oþere; but sikirly þis is alwey incorruptible, 
if it be kept cloos fro fli3t Also it is not coold and drie as erþe. 
for souereynly it worchiþ & chaungiþ. And it is not hoot and 
drie as fier, as it schewiþ by experience; for hoot þingis it keliþ, 
& hoot sijknessis it doiþ awey Also þat it 3eueþ incorruptibilite, 
and kepiþ a þing fro corruptibilite [\f. 11\] and rotynge, it is preued 
þus Forwhi. what pece of fleisch, fisch, or deed brid, be putt 
þerinne, it schal not corru[{m{]pe ne rote whilis it is þerinne 
miche more þanne it wole kepe quyk fleisch of mannys body 
from al manere corruptibilite and rotynge This is oure quinta 
essencia, þat is to seie, mannys heuene, þat god made to þe conseruacioun 
|P_3 
of þe .4. qualitees of mannys body, ri3t as he made 
his heuene to þe conseruacioun of al þe world And wite 3e for 
certeyn þat manye philosophoris and lechis þat ben now, knowe 
nou3t þis quinta essencia, ne þe truþe þerof Forwhi; god wole 
not þat þei knowe it; for her greet brennynge coueitise & 
vicious lyuynge Forsoþe quinta essencia superior, þat is to seie, 
heuene of oure lord god bi him silf Aloone 3eueþ not conseruacioun 
in þe world, and wondirful influence, but by þe vertue 
of þe sunne, planetis, and oþere sterris; ri3t so oure quinta 
essencia, þat is, mannys heuene, wole be maad fair wiþ þe sunne 
mineralle, fynyd, schynynge, incorruptibile; and euene in qualite 
þat fier may not appeire, corrumpe, ne distroie. and þis is verry 
gold of þe myn, of þe erþe, or of þe floodis gaderid for gold of 
alkamy maad with corosyues distroieþ kynde, as aristotle and 
manye oþere philosophoris prouen and þerfore good gold naturel, 
& of þe myn of þe erþe, is clepid of philosophoris 'sol' in 
latyn; for he is þe sonne of oure heuene, lich as sol þe planet is 
in þe heuene aboue; for þis planete 3eueþ to gold his influence, 
nature, colour, & a substaunce incorruptible. And oure quinta 
essencia, mannys heuene, is of þe nature [\f. 11b\] & þe colour of heuene 
And oure sol, þat is, fyn gold of þe myne, schal make it fair, ri3t 
as sol þe planete makiþ heuene fair and so þese two togidere 
ioyned schal 3eue influence in us, and þe condiciouns of heuene 
and of heuenly sonne in as miche as it is possible in deedly 
nature, conseruacioun and restorynge of nature lost, & renewynge 
of 3ongþe And it schal 3eue plenteuously heelþe: and so it 
is preued by astronomy aboue, þat sterris þat haþ influence vpon 
þe heed and þe necke of man as ben þe sterris of aries, taurus, 
and gemini, 3euen influence syngulerly vpon~ Gerapigra galieni 
And þerfore it haþ a synguler strenkþe, by þe ordynaunce of 
god, to drawe awey þe superflue humouris fro þe heed, þe necke, 
and þe brest, and not fro þe membris byneþe And so I seie of 
spicis þat drawiþ humouris fro þe knees, þe leggis, and þe feet, 
þat resseyuen a synguler influence of þe sterris of Capricorn, 
Aquarie and pisces, & ri3t so of oþere, et cetera Comounne 
3e not þis book of deuyne secretes to wickid men and auerous; 
|P_4 
but kepe 3e it in priuytee Take þe beste wiyn þat 3e may 
fynde, if 3e be of power; & if 3e be ri3t pore, þanne take 
corrupt wiyn, þat is, rotyn, of a watery humour, but not egre, 
þat is, sour, for þe quint essencia þerof is naturaly incorruptible 
þe which 3e schal drawe out by sublymacioun And þanne 
schal þer leue in þe ground of þe vessel þe .4. elementis, as it 
were, rotun fecis of wiyn But firste 3e muste distille þis wiyn 
.7. tymes; & þanne haue 3e good brennynge watir Forsoþe, 
þis is þe watri mater [\f. 12\] fro which is drawe oure quinta essencia 
Thanne muste 3e do make in þe furneis of aischin, a distillatorie 
of glas al hool of oo. pece, wiþ an hoole a-boue in þe heed, where 
þe watir schal be putt yn, and be take out And þis is a 
wondirful instrument þat þat þing þat by vertues of fier ascendith 
and distillith wiþinne þe vessel, per canales brachiales, þat is, by 
pipis lich to armys, be bore a3en, and eftsoones ascendith, & 
eft descendiþ contynuely day and ny3t, til þe brennynge water 
heuenly be turned into quintam essenciam And so bi continuelle 
ascenciouns & discenciouns, þe quinta essencia is 
departid fro þe corruptible composicioun of þe .4. elementis. 
For bifore þat þing þat is twies sublymed is more glorified, and 
is more sotil, and fer from þe corrumpcioun of þe .4. elementis 
more separat þan whanne it ascendith but oonys; and so vnto 
a þousand tymes, so þat by contynuel ascendynge and descendynge, 
by the which it is sublymed to so myche hi3nes of glorificacioun, 
it schal come þat it schal be a medicyn incorruptible 
almoost as heuene aboue, and of þe nature of heuene And 
þerfore oure quinta essencia worþily is clepid 'mannys heuene' 
And aftir manye daies þat it hath be in þis sotil vessel of glas 
distillid 3e schulen opene þe hoole of þe vessel in þe heed þat 
was selid with þe seel of lute of wijsdom, maad of þe sotillest 
flour, and of white of eyren, and of moist papere, ymeyngid so 
þat no þing respire out And whane 3e opene þe hoole. if þer 
come out a passynge heuenly swete flauour þat alle men þat 
come yn naturely [\f. 12b\] drawe þerto. þanne 3e haue oure quinta 
essencia and ellis sele þe vessel, and putte it to þe fier a3en 
til 3e haue it. 
 
|P_5 
And anoþer maner worchinge of oure quinta essencia is 
þis Take þe noblest and þe strengest brennynge watir þat 3e 
may haue distillid out of pure my3ty wiyn, and putte it into 
a glas clepid amphora, with a long necke and close þe mouþ 
strongly wiþ wex; And loke þat half or þe þridde part be fulle; 
and birie it al in hors dounge, preparate as it is seid hereafter 
so þat þe necke of þe glas be turned dounward, & þe botum 
be turned vpward, þat by vertu of þe hors dounge þe quinta 
essencia ascende vp to þe botum. And þe groste of þe mater 
of þe watir descende dounward to þe necke And aftir manye 
daies, whanne 3e take it out, softly lift vp þe glas as it stondith, 
and 3e schal se in þickenes and cleernesse a difference bitwene 
þe quintam essenciam sublymed, and þe grose mater þat is in þe 
necke þe wondirful maistry of departynge of þat oon fro þat 
oþer is þis Take a scharp poyntel, or a pricke of yren, & 
peerse into þe wex þat hongiþ in þe mouþ of þe glas a3ens þe 
erþe and whanne 3e haue peersid al fully to þe watir, take out 
þe poyntel or þe pricke And þat erþely watir wole first come 
out þat is in þe necke and so til it be come out vnto þe 
departinge bitwixe it and þe quinte essence, þat is, mannys 
heuene sublymed. and whane 3e se þat þis quint essence wole 
renne & melte aftir þat þis erþely watir be voydid, putte þanne 
swiftly 3oure fyngir to þe hoole, & turne vp þe glas, and þanne 
3e haue þerinne oure quinte essence, [\f. 13\] and þe erþely watir wiþoute 
aside. And þis is a passyng souereyn priuytee. 
 
The þridde maner is, þat 3e take a greet glas clepid amphora, 
and seele it weel, and birie it weel in þe wombe of an hors al 
togidere, and þe purete of þe quinte essencie schal be sublymed 
aboue, & þe groste schal abide byneþe in þe botme take out 
softli þat þat fletiþ a-boue; and þat þat leeueþ bihynde; putte it 
to þe fier. 
 
The .iiij. maner is þis. take what vessel of glas þat 3e wole, 
or of erþe strongly glasid, and þer-vpon a round foot of glas 
wiþ a leg. and seele þe vessel with his couertour, þat þe rod 
of þe foot of þe glas wiþinne þe vessel honge in þe eyr, þat þat 
þing þat ascendith to þe couertour in þe maner of a pott boilynge 
|P_6 
descende doun a3en by þe foot of þe glas. and this instrument 
may 3e do make wiþoute greet cost The fifþe maner is, þat þe 
brennynge water be .10 tymes distillid in hors dounge contynuely 
digest. 
 
The science of makynge of fier wiþoute fier wherby 3e 
may make oure quinte essence wiþoute cost or traueile, and 
withoute occupacioun and lesynge of tyme Take þe beste horse 
dounge þat may be had þat is weel digest, and putte it wiþine 
a uessel, or ellis a pitt maad wiþ þe erþe anoyntid þoru3out with 
past maad of aischin. And in þis vessel or pitt, bete weel togidere 
þe dounge; And in þe myddil of þis doung, sette þe vessel of 
distillacioun vnto þe myddis or more For it is nede þat al þe 
heed of þe vessel be in þe coold eir þat, þat þing þat bi vertu 
of þe fier of þe doung þat ascendith þerby be turned into watir 
[\f. 13b\] by vertu of cooldnes of þe eir and falle doun a3en and ascende 
vp a3en. and þus 3e haue fier wiþoute fier, and but wiþ litil 
traueile. 
 
Also anoþer maner of fier. sette 3oure vessel forseid to þe 
strong reuerberacioun of þe sunne in somer tyme, and lete it 
stonde þere ny3t and day. 
 
Here I wole teche 3ou how pore euangelik men may haue 
wiþoute cost, and almoost for nou3t, þe gracious influence of 
gold, and þe maner of þe fixynge of it in oure heuene, þat is, 
oure quinta essencia. if 3e be pore, 3e schal preie a riche man 
þat is 3oure freend to leene 3ou a good floreyn of florence and 
anele it vpon a plate of yren as yren is anelid. and haue biside 
3ou a uessel of erþe glasid, fillid ful of the beste brennynge watir 
þat 3e may fynde. & caste into þe watir þe floreyn anelid. and 
loke þat 3e haue a sotilte and a slei3þe to quenche sodeynly þe 
fier, þat þe watir waaste not; and be weel war þat non yren touche 
þe watir. but af[{t{]er caste into þe watir þe floreyn, and do so .l. 
tymes or more, for þe oftere þe bettere it is And if 3e se þat þe 
watir waaste to myche, chaunge it þanne, and take newe, & do 
so ofte tymes. and whanne 3e haue do 3oure quenchour, putte 
alle þe watris togidere And 3e schulen vndirstonde þat þe 
vertu of brennynge watir is sich þat naturely it drawiþ out of 
|P_7 
gold alle þe vertues & propirtees of it, & it holdiþ incorrumptibiletee 
& an euene heete. [\f. 14\] þanne meynge þis brennynge 
watir þus giltid wiþ oure quinte essence, and vse it. but be war 
þat 3e quenche not þe floreyn in oure quinte essence; for þanne 
it were lost And if it so be þat 3e haue not þis brennynge watir 
redy, þanne quenche 3oure floreyn in þe beste whi3t wiyn þat 
may be had For sikirly þe philosophore seiþ, þat wiyn hath 
also þe propirtee to restreyne in it þe influence and vertues of 
gold And whanne 3e haue do 3oure werk, 3e schal wite þat þe 
floreyn is als good, & almoost of þe same wei3te, as it was 
afore þerfore vse wiyn or brennynge watir giltid, so þat 3e may 
be hool, and wexe glad, and be 3ong. And þus 3e haue oure 
heuene, and þe sunne in him fixid, to þe conseruacioun of mannys 
nature and fixacioun of oure heuene, þat is, oure quinte 
essence. 
 
The science how 3e schule gilde more my3tily by brennynge 
watir or wiyn þan I tau3te you tofore, wherby þe water or 
þe wiyn schal take to it my3tily þe influence & þe vertues 
of fyne gold. 
 
Take þe calx of fyn gold as it is declarid here-aftir in þis 
book, and putte it in a siluer spone, and anele it at þe fier. 
& þanne caste þe cals of the gold in þe brennynge watir 
or in wiyn .l. tymes, as I tau3te 3ou tofore wiþ þe floreyn. and 
3e schule haue 3oure licour by an hundrid part bettir gilt þan 3e 
had tofore wiþ þe floreyn Forwhi. fier worchiþ more strongly 
and bettere [\f. 14b\] in sotil parties þan it doiþ in an hool plate And 
also brennynge watir or wiyn drawiþ out more my3tily bi a 
þousand part þe propirtees of gold fro smale parties anelid, þan 
it doiþ fro a þicke plate And 3e schal vndirstonde þat wiyn 
not aloonly holdiþ in it þe propirtees of gold, but myche more 
þe propirtees of alle liquibles if þei be quenchid þerinne. and þat 
is a souereyn priuite: Forwhi, if 3e quenche saturne liquified 
in wiyn or in comoun watir .7. tymes, and aftirward in þat wiyn 
or watir 3e quenche mars manye tymes, þanne mars schal take 
algate þe neischede and þe softnes of saturne And þe same 
schal venus do, & alle oþere liquibles or ellis, And 3e 
|P_8 
quenche mars in whi3t wiyn or in comoun watir manye tymes, 
and aftirward in þe same wiyn or watir 3e caste saturne liquified 
ofte tymes, þanne wiþoute doute 3e schal fynde þat þe saturne 
is maad ri3t hard Therfore þe propirtees of alle liquibles may 
be brou3t into wiyn or watir; but myche more my3tily into 
brennynge watir good and precious. 
 
The science to make a fier, þat is, wiþoute cole, withoute 
lyme, wiþoute li3t, worchinge a3ens al maner scharpnes or 
accioun of visible fier, ri3t as worchiþ þe fier of helle And 
þis priuytee is so vertuous, þat þe vertu þerof may not al be 
declarid. And þus it is maad. Take Mercurie þat is sublymed 
with vitriol, [\f. 15\] & comen salt, & sal armoniac .7. or .10. tymes 
sublymed and meynge hem togidere by euene porcioun. and 
grynde it smal, and leye it abrood vpon a marbil stoon; and by 
ny3te sette it in a soft cleer eir, or ellis in a coold seler; and þere 
it wole turne into watir And þanne gadere it togidere in to 
a strong vessel of glas, and kepe it This water forsoþe is so 
strong, þat if a litil drope þerof falle vpon 3oure hond, anoon it 
wole perce it þoru3-out; and in þe same maner it wole do, if it 
falle vpon a plate of venus or Iubiter, into þis watir, it turneþ 
hem into lijknes of peerl. who so coude reparale & preparate 
kyndely þis fier, wiþoute doute it wolde quenche anoon a brennynge 
sijknes clepid þe fier of helle. And also it wolde heele 
euery cor[{os{]if sijknesse. And manye philosophoris clepiþ þis 
þing in her bookis 'sal amarus,' al þou3 þei teche not þe maistrie 
þerof If it be so þat þis firy watir breke þe glas, and renne out 
into þe aischen, þanne gadere alle togidere þat 3e fynde pastid in 
þe aischen and leye it vpon a marbil stoon as afore, and it wole 
turne into watir. And þis is a greet priuytee. 
 
The science to brynge gold into calx Take fyn gold, and 
make it into smal lymayl: take a crusible wiþ a good quantitee 
of Mercurie, and sette it to a litil fier so þat it vapoure 
not, and putte þerinne þi lymail of gold, and stire it weel togidere 
& aftirward [\f. 15b\] wiþinne a litil tyme 3e schal se al þe gold 
wiþinne þe Mercurie turned into erþe as sotil as flour. þanne 
3eue it a good fier, þat þe Mercurie arise and go his wey; or ellis, 
|P_9 
and 3e wole, 3e may distille and gadere it, puttynge þer-vpon a 
lembike and in þe corusible 3e schal fynde þe gold calcyned and 
reducid into erþe And if 3e wole not make lymayl of gold, 
þanne make þerof a sotil þinne plate, as 3e kan, and putte wiþinne 
þe Mercurie al warm; and 3e schal haue 3oure desier And 
in þis same maner 3e may worche wiþ siluir Thanne take þe 
calx of þese two bodies, and bere hem openly wiþ 3ou; and þer 
schal noman knowe what þei ben And if 3e wole bere hem 
more priuyly wiþoute ony knowynge, þanne meynge hem wiþ 
pich melt, or wex, or ellis gumme, for þanne noman schal knowe 
it what it is. And whanne 3e wole dissolue ony of þese calces 
by hem silf, putte eiþir by him silf in a test, or ellis þe pich or 
þe wex in which þei ben ynne; and anoon schal come out verry 
gold & siluer as þei were tofore. 
 
Now I wole teche 3ou þe maistrie of departynge of gold 
fro siluir whanne þei be meyngid togidere Forsoþe 3e woot 
weel þat þer be manye werkis in þe whiche gold and siluir 
be meyngid, as in giltynge of vessel & Iewellis þerfore 
whanne 3e wole drawe þe toon fro þat oþir, putte al þat mixture 
into a strong watir maad of vitriol and of sal petre. and þe 
[\f. 16\] siluyr wole be dissolued, and not þe gold: þanne 3e haue þat 
oon departid fro þe toþir And if 3e wole dissolue þe gold to 
watir, putte þanne yn þe watir corosyue, Sal armoniac; and þat 
watir wiþoute doute wole dissolue gold into watir. 
 
The science to drawe out of fyn gold v=ta= essencia is þis 
First 3e schal reduce gold into calx, as I tolde 3ou tofore 
þanne take vynegre distillid, or ellis oold vryne depurid fro þe 
fecis, and putte it in a uessel glasid; and þe liquor schal be in 
þe hei3þe of 4. ynchis; and þerinne caste þe calx of gold, & 
sette it to the strong sunne in somer tyme, þere to abide and 
soone aftir 3e schal se as it were a liquor of oyle ascende vp, 
fletynge aboue in maner of a skyn or of a reme. gadere þat awey 
wiþ a sotil spone or ellis a feþere, and putte it into a uessel of 
glas in þe which be putt watir tofore. and þus gadere it manye 
tymes in þe day, into þe tyme þat þer ascende nomore and aftir 
do vapoure awey þe watir at þe fier. And þe v=ta= essencia of þe 
|P_10 
gold wole abyde byneþe. And manye philosophoris clepiþ þis 
quinta essencia an oile incombustible, þat is a greet priuytee 
And if 3e wole fixe þis quinta essencia in oure heuene, þat it 
may wiþoute doute restore a3en to man þat nature þat is lost, 
and reduce him a3en into þe vertu of þe strenkþe of 3ongþe, and 
also lenkþiþ his lijf into þe laste terme of lijf set of god Now 
forsoþe I haue toold 3ou þe souereynest [\f. 16b\] priuytee and restorynge 
of mannys kynde, and in part greet þing þat schulde not be 
schewid Forwhi. þis oyle, þat is to seie, quinta essencia of gold, 
hath þe mooste swetnes and vertu to a-swage and putte awei þe 
ache of woundis, and for to heele woundis, oolde sooris, and 
manye wondirful yuelis Also in þe same maner 3e may drawe 
out of siluir, quinte essencie 
 
The science to drawe out of antymony, þat is, mercasite 
of leed, þe v=te= essencie, is a souereyn maistrie, and a priuytee 
of alle priuytees Take þe myn of antymony aforeseid, 
and make þerof al so sotil a poudre as 3e kan þanne 
take þe beste vynegre distillid, and putte þerinne þe poudre 
of antymonye, and lete it stonde in a glas vpon a litil fier 
into þe tyme þat þe vynegre be colourid reed. þanne take þat 
vynegre awey, and kepe it clene, and putte a3en þer-to of oþere 
vynegre distillid, and lete it stonde vpon a soft fier til it be 
colourid reed. & so do ofte tymes. and whanne 3e haue gaderid 
al 3oure vynegre colourid, putte it þanne in a distillatorie. and 
first þe vynegre wole ascende; þanne after 3e schal se merueilis: 
for 3e schal se as it were a þousand dropis of blessid wiyn 
discende doun in maner of reed dropis, as it were blood, by 
þe pipe of þe lymbike þe which licour, gadere togidere in a 
rotumbe and þanne 3e haue a þing þat al þe tresour of þe world 
may not be in comparisoun of worþines þerto aristotle seiþ þat 
it is his lede in þe book of secretis, al þou3 he [\f. 17\] telle not þe name 
of þe antymonye aforseid Forsoþe þis doiþ awey ache of alle 
woundis, and wondirfully heeliþ. þe vertu þerof is incorruptible 
& merueilous profitable it nedit to be putrified in a rotombe 
and seelid in fyme, and þanne it worchiþ greet priuytees Forsoþe 
þe v=ta= essencia of þis antymony þat is reed, in þe which is 
|P_11 
þe secreet of alle secretis, is swettere þan ony hony, or sugre, or 
ony oþir þing. 
 
The science in the extraccioun of þe .5 essencie from blood, 
and fleisch, & eggis To 3ou I seie, þat in euery elementid 
þing, þe .5. essencie remayneþ incorrupte: it schal be þanne 
þe moost þing of merueyle if I teche 3ou to drawe out þat 
fro mannys blood reserued of Barbouris whanne þei lete blood;

Here bigynneth the secunde book of medicyns The first 
medicyn is to reduce an oold feble euangelik man to þe firste 
strenkþe of 3ongþe Also to restore a3en his nature þat is 
lost, and to lenkþe his lijf in greet gladnesse and perfi3te heele 
vnto þe laste teerme of his lijf þat is sett of god 3e schal take 
oure 5=ta= essencie aforeseid, þat is to seye, mannys heuene, and 
þerinne putte a litil quantite of 5 essencia of gold and of peerl. 
and þe oolde feble man schal vse þis deuyn drynk at morn and 
at euen, ech tyme a walnote-schelle fulle and wiþinne a fewe 
dayes he schal so hool þat he schal fele him silf of þe statt and 
þe strenkþe of xl 3eer; and he schal haue greet ioie þat he is 
come to þe statt of 3ongþe. And whanne his 3ongþe is recouerid, 
and his nature restorid, and heelþe had, it is nedeful þat litil and 
seelde he vse 5 essence Also it is nedeful þat he vse ofte good 
wiyn at his mete and at þe soper, in þe which be fixid þe 5. 
essence of gold, as I tau3te 3ou tofore. 
 
The secunde [\f. 19b\] medicyn is to heele a man, and make hym 
lyue, þat is almoost consumed in nature, and so ny3 deed þat 
he is forsake of lechis. but if it be þe laste teerme of his lijf 
sett of god, 3e schal 3eue him oure quinte essence of gold wiþ a 
litil quantite of watir of celendoyn 3drawe, and meynge it wiþ 
þe oþere þingis aforeseid and anoon as þe sike hath resceyued 
it into his stomak, it 3eueþ to þe herte influence of naturel heete 
and of lijf. and þanne 3e schal se him rise vp and speke, and 
wondirfully be comfortid and strenkþid þerby þanne comforte 
him wiþ ministracioun of oure quinte essencie afore seid, and he 
schal be al hool but if it be so þat god wole algatis þat he schal 
die And I seie to 3ou truly, þat þis is þe hi3este maistrie þat 
may be in transmutacioun of kynde; for ri3t fewe lechis now 
lyuynge knowe þis priuytee.

The þridde medicyn is to cure þe lepre þat is causid of 
corrupcioun and putrifaccioun of ony of þe principal humouris 
of man; but not þe lepre þat comeþ to man of kynde of 
þe fadir and of þe modir leprous, - for it is callid morbus 
hereditus, - ne þe lepre þat is sent of god by his plage, but þat 
þat is causid oonly of rotun humouris take oure 5 essence 
aforeseid, wiþ þe quinte essence of goold and peerl, a litil quantite 
at oonys, and vse it in maner as I seide afore and wiþinne a 
fewe daies he schal be partily hool þerof. and if 3e haue non 
preparate redy oure 5 essence, þanne take in þe stide þerof fyn 
brennynge watir but þat oþer is bettere. 
 
Also, drawe a water of þe fruy3t of strawbery or mulbery 
tree, whanne it is ripe, and waische þe lepre þerwiþ. þis watir 
is of so greet vertu; for a souereyn maistir took it a leprous 
[\f. 20\] womman, þat wiþ þe waischinge oonly of þis watir, withynne 
schort tyme was maad al hool but sikirly þe vertu þerof is

The 4 medicyn is to cure palsie vniuersel. Forsoþe alle 
philosophoris seyn þat þe palesye vniuersel comeþ of haboundaunce

þingis þat schal cure þis sijknes be temperate, hoot, and moist, 
and a litil attractyue, and to þe synous confortatyue Therfore, 
blessid be god, makere of kynde, þat ordeynede for þe man

restorynge, and temperatly worchynge þerfore fixe 
þerinne þe 5 essence of þo laxatyues þat purgen flewme & 
viscous humouris, as a litil of euforbie, or turbit, or sambucy. 
& þanne wiþoute doute, if god wole, þe paralitik man schal be 
hool wiþ comfortynge and restorynge of kynde, if 3e make him 
a stewe hoot and moist with herbis, þat is to seye, eerbe yue, 
& sauge, þat haue an heuenly strenkþe to comforte þe joynctis, 
& þe senewis, and þe vertu motyue. and if 3e haue not redi 
preparate oure 5 essence, þanne take fyn brennynge watir til it 
|P_17 
be redy, and lete þe pacient drynke þerof a litil in fyn wiyn. 
and also he schal waische al his body and his extremytees wiþ 
brennynge watir ofte tymes. and lete him vse þis a good while, 
& he schal be hool. 
 
[\f. 20b\] The .5 medicyn for a man þat is almoost al consumed, 
& waastid in al his body, and ri3t leene, as þat man þat

is oure 5 essence Forwhi. it comfortiþ þe feble nature; and 
þe nature þat is lost it restoriþ, & so restorid it preserueþ 
And þerfore if 3e wol restore þe fleisch of a leene mannys body 
almoost consumed awey, drawe þanne a watir of celidoyne, and 
take þerof a litil quantite, and meynge wiþ oure 5 essence if 3e

togidere and þerfore þe feuere agu is þe posityue degree, and 
in þe superlatyue degree, comparatif gree & superlatif gree 
For þe feuere agu haþ comounly alienacioun of witt, & schewynge 
of þingis of fantasy And 3e schal knowe weel whiche 
ben þe humouris adust þat causen þe feuere, be þese [\f. 24\] tokenes 
Forwhi, if þe pacient seiþ þat he seeþ blak þingis, þanne blak 
coler, þat is, malencolie, is adust & if he se þingis of gold 
reed coler is adust if reed þingis, and schewynge of bloodt 
þanne blood is adust And if he seiþ þat he seeþ alle þese .iij, 
þingis, þanne alle þe humouris ben adust For as myche as 
brennynge watir ascendiþ to þe heed, and gladly wole a man 
drynke And siþ þat feuere agu regneþ in þe regioun of þe 
heed þe philosophoris counceilis þat þe pacient schal not 
resceyue it in þis sijknes but it is nedeful þat he take 
oure 5 essence of gold and of peerl, meynging þe 6 part of 
5 essence of watir of rose, violet, borage, and letuse and 
þanne 3e schulen haue an heuenly medicyn to cure perfi3tly þis 
sijknesse. 
 
For to cure þe frenesye and woodnes, or ellis at þe leeste 
to swage it take a greet quantite of popilion, and þe beste 
vynegre þat 3e may haue, and a good quantite of rewe domestik, 
weel brayed, and meyngid wiþ þese forseid þingis; and biclippe 
þe heed and þe feet of þe pacient with þis medicyn; and sum 
þerof putte to his nose-þrillis. þis medicyn anoon puttiþ awey þe 
frenesye & þe schewynge of fantasies it curiþ also wode men 
& lunatike men. and it restoriþ a3en witt and discrecioun, & 
makiþ al hool and weel at eese. 
 
The .13. medicyn is to put a-wey þe craumpe fro a man. 
for as myche as wise men seyn þat þe craumpe cometh of þe 
hurtynge & þe febilnes of þe senewis, as it schewiþ sumtyme 
yn medicyns maad of elebore, þer is no þing þat puttiþ awey þe 
|P_23 
craumpe as doiþ oure 5 essence aforeseid, or ellis [\f. 24b\] brennynge 
watir in stede of it. 
 
The .14. medicyn, to caste out venym fro mannys body 
take oure 5 essence, and putte þerine fleisch of a cok, neysch 
soden & sotilly brayed, note kirnelis, fyn triacle, radisch, 
& garleek smal brayed, and oþere þingis þat ben goode 
to caste out venym, as comoun bookis of fisik declariþ 
And also, to comforte þe herte, putte yn oure foreseid 5. essence, 
þe 5. essence of gold and of peerl. and he schal be delyuerid 
þerof & be hool. 
 
The .15. medicyn, to make a man þat is a coward, hardy 
and strong, and putte a-wey almaner of cowardise and drede 
I seye 3ou forsoþe þat no þing may telle alle þe myraclis vertues 
þat god haþ maad in oure 5 essence, and not al oonly in 
him, but also in to his modir, þat is to seye, fyn brennynge 
watir. for to cure þis sijknesse, take a litil quantite of oure 5 
essence, & putte þerto double so myche of brennynge watir, 
and a litil quantite of þe iuys of eerbe pione and of saffron distillid 
togidere, and a litil of 5 essence of gold and of peerl; and 
3eue it him to drinke. and aftir sodeynly, as it were by myracle, 
þe coward man schal lese al maner drede and feyntnes of herte, 
and he schal recouere strenkþe þat ys lost by drede, and take to 
him hardynesse, and he schal dispise deeþ; he schal drede no 
perelis, and passyngly he schal be maad hardy. þis is trewe, for 
it haþ ofte tymes by oolde philosophoris [{bene{] preued þerfore 
it were a greet wisdom þat cristen princis, in bateilis a3en 
heþene men, hadde wiþ hem in tonnes brennynge watir, þat 
þei my3t take to euery fi3tynge man half a ri3t litil cuppe ful 
þerof to drynke in þe bigynnynge of þe batel. & þis priuyte 
owith to be hid from alle enemyes of þe chirche; and also 
[\f. 25\] princis and lordis ministringe þese þingis schulde not telle 
what it is. 
 
The .16. medicyn a3ens þe feuere pestilenciale, and þe 
maistrie to cure it. forsoþe holy scripture seiþ þat summe 
tymes oure lord god sendiþ pestilence to sle summe maner 
of peple, as it is seid deutronomium 28 in þis maner. "Si 
|P_24 
audire nolueris vocem domini dei tui, ut custodias et facias 
omnia mandata eius, veniant super te omnes maledicciones; iste 
maledictus eris in ciuitate &c." et infra; "ad-iungat tibi pestilenciam 
donec consumat te de terra, percuciat te dominus egestate, 
febre, et frigore, ardore et estu, et aere corrupto ac rubigine, et persequatur 
donec pereas" hec ibidem; et infra "percuciat te dominus 
vlcere egipti, et partem corporis per quam stercora egerantur. 
scabie quoque, et prurigine, ita ut curari nequeas; percuciat te 
dominus necessitate ac furore mentis" Therfore a gret fool 
were he þat wolde presume to cure þese plagis of pestilence þat 
ben vncurable, þat ben sent of god to ponysche synne Also 
3e schal vndirstonde þat men may die in .iij. maners. in oon 
maner by naturel deeþ, in þe teerme þat is sett of god In 
anoþir maner bi violent deeþ, and also in þe .iij. maner occasionaly 
wiþinne þe teerme þat is sett of god; as þo men þat to 
myche replecioun, or to greet abstynence or by disperacioun, or 
ellis by necligence, sle him silf but sikirly alle oþere maner 
of feueris pestilence þat god suffriþ to come to mankynde by 
perilous influence of yuele planetis, by þe grace of god & good 
gouernaunce may be curid partialy wiþ oure 5. essence. and 
þerinne putte a litil of aloes epatik & euforbij, & a litil of 
ierapigra galieni & of 5 essence, of þe rote of lilie and also 
of gold & peerle, capilli veneris [\f. 25b\] and ysope; for þese þingis 
ben nedeful to siche feueris & apostemes it is nedeful also 
þat wiþ þese þingis þer be sich a quinta essencia laxatyue þat 
wole purge þe superflue humouris þat abounde; and þat þe 
pacient so myche resceyue in a natural day þerof þat he may 
go weel oonys to sege; and so lete him vse þis laxatif .3. in þe 
woke; But be weel war þat he take wiþ oure quinta essencia 
but ri3t a litil quantite of þe laxatif at oonys, as I tolde 3ou 
tofore, for peril þat mi3te bifalle. & euery day take he by þe 
morowe an eye-schelle ful of good brennynge watir, and þe corrupt 
eyr schal not noye him; & also vse in þe dayes, two or 
þre smale pelotis pestilenciales in oure 5 essencia, or in brennynge 
watir; & al þe hous of þe pacient schal be encensid 
|P_25 
strongly .iij in þe day wiþ frank-encense, mirre, & rosyn, 
terbentyn & rewe. and þis is perfi3t cure for þe feuere pestilence 
And þus 3e may, wiþ þis 5 essencijs, cure alle þese sijknesses 
aforeseid, and manye oþere, as it were by myracle, if 3e 
worche disc[{r{]eetly as I haue toold 3ou tofore Now here 
I make an eende of þis tretis þat is clepid þe mooste & þe
