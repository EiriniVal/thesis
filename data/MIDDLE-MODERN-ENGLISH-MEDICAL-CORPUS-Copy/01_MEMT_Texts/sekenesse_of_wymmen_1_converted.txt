[^SEKENESSE OF WYMMEN 1^] 
 
|P_27 
[\f. 60r\] Here be gynnes þe sekenesse of wymmen wech ys clepyd 
þe moder id est matrix . Ye schal vnderstonde þat 
wymmen hafe las heete yn þem þen men, and more moystnesse 
for defaute of heete þat schuld drye hyre humours and hyre moystenesse, 
but neuer þe lese kynde hathe ordeyned wymmen a purgacyoun 
of bledynge at certayn tymes, to make hyre bodyes 
clene and hoole of sekenesse, þe whych purgacioun of bledyng 
þey hafe from tyme þat þey ar xij yeere of age in to þe tyme 
of fyfty yeere. And som hafe it lengere as þei þat be of hye 
complexioun and be norysched with hote metys and drinkys, and 
lyuoun yn mych rest, and þey hafe þis purgacyoun euery moneth 
oones, but when þey ben with childe ore þat þey be of drye complexioun 
and laboure muche. For when þey byn with chylde 
tyll þei be delyuered þey haue nat þis purgacioun, fore þen 
þe childe yn hyre wombe ys norysched with þe blode. And if þey 
hafe purgacioun in syche tyme, yt betokenneth þat þe childe refuseth 
þat blode and þen þe childe is seke and lyke to dye, ore it be borne. 
Wymmen beyng of hye complexioun þat faren well and hafe 
myche ese, hafe þis purgacioun oftere þen oones yn a moneth. 
And þe blode þat passeth from hem in þis purgacioun yt cometh oute 
of þe veynes of þe matryce. The matrix ys a skynne þat þe 
childe ys closed yn in his modere wombe, and mony of the 
greuaunce þat wymmen hafe ar caused of þe moder þat we calle 
þe matrix. Oon ys mych flooynge oute of tyme of þis blode 
and yt febuls wymmen mych, a noþer ys stoppynge of þis blode 
be fore sayde, a noþer ys suffocacyoun of þe matrice, a nothere 
ys precipitacyoun, a noþer when þe matrix fleythe with yn forthe, 
a noþer is a posteme of þe matrice, a noþer is swellynge of 
þe matrix, a noþer is greuaunce yn bering of childe or 
hardnesse or þey may be delyuered, a noþer ys goynge oute of 
|P_29 
[\f. 60v\] þe moder be nethe forthe, a noþer ys with haldynge of þe 
secundyne, a noþer is ache of þe modere. 
Wyth haldynge of here blode þat sche may not hafe here purgacyoun 
yn due tyme ys caused of dyuerse maners, as of 
hete or of colde of þe modere, or of hote or of colde humours 
of veynes of þe modere, or of humours enclosyed yn þe moder, 
or of gret drynes of hire complexioun, or mych wakyng 
or of mych thynkynge, or of gret angure or of myche 
sorowe, or of myche fastynge. Generally sygnes and 
tokens of þis sekenesse ben age ache and greuaunce and 
heuynesse from þe nauyl to þe priuy membre, and ache of 
þe reygnesse and of all þe ryge boon, and of þe forehed 
and of þe nekke, and of þe yen and of infeccyoun of he bryes, 
þat ys to saye chaungynge of hire coloure yn to a nothere 
coloure þen þey schulden hafe. Also heuynesse a boute 
þe mowthe of hyre wombe and of here stomakes. And 
ache a boute þe schuldren blades bothe be fore and behynde 
and heuynes of here thyes, of hyre hyppes and 
of hyre hammyes and of hyre legges. And þey hafe sumtymys 
a vnskylfull appetyte to metys þat ben not acordynge 
vn to þem, as to ete colys. And hyre face 
ys yuell colerd. And som tymes þey wax wannysche 
yn hyre visage. And othere whyles in þis sekenesse 
þey hafe wyll to comyn with man and doon. And þen 
þey bringes forth childerne þat are mesyllys, or elles þey 
hafe oþer foule sekenesse and long with haldynge of 
þis blode maketh wymmen othere whyles to fall yn to 
a dropsy, and sum tyme it causythe þe emoroides, sum 
tyme yt greuyth þe hert and maketh þem to hafe a 
cardyakull. Sum tyme yt afrayeth þem fallyng as 
þey had þe foule euyll, and so lye a daye or ij 
|P_31 
[\f. 61r\] as þey were ded. And if þat þis wythholdynge be 
fore thyknesse of blode þat stoppythe þe endys of þe veynes of þe 
modere þat þe blod may not floo yn dew tyme, þen hire vryn 
wyl be red sum tyme as blode, and in tyme þey schuld hafe hyre 
purgacyoun it wyl be derke and þe veynes of hire body wyl be 
ful of blode and hire yeen clere red. And if þis stoppyng be 
caused of coleryk humours, þen þey fele brennynge and prikkyng 
with yn forthe and þen hire vryn ys hygh of coloure and fatty. And 
in tyme of hire purgacioun a iij or iiij dayes afore þey be delyuerd 
when þey go to pryvey of colerik matere herd as yt 
were brent, and hyre yeen ben of swart rede coloure. And if yt 
be caused of flewme, þen hire vryn is fatt and discolerd and 
yn tyme of here purgacyoun þey ben delyuered of fleumatyk mater. 
When þey goon to pryuey þat ys whyght and thynne, hire colour 
ys febull and þere yeen swell som what. And if be 
caused of malecoly, þen þei fele mych heuynesse be neythe 
forthe, þen hyre vryn ys dyscolerd and thynne and þer yn ys 
sum tyme axen, smale grauayle as axen. Sum tyme it is 
blak and fat and þer yn be lytul blake metys and derke and 
yn tyme of here purgacioun if þey delyer þem of ony þynge it 
is but lytull. And wymmen þat be stopped, here vryn is medelt 
with lytul blake smale axen as it were of coles. Sum tyme 
yt ys whyght and thykke and darke as mylke, sum tyme 
whyght and þynne with squames mater hangynge yn þe vryn 
or smal blake bodyes medult with þe vryn. And also 
sum tymes þer ben corrupt humours yn þe modre with oute þe veynys 
and þei letten wymmen of þer purgacioun, þe which ben oon 
of iij humors, as flewme, malencoly, or coloure. Tokennys 
of flemme ben þese: ful mych moystenesse, and þei hafe 
no corage to man, and þey fele mych heuynes from þe 
nauyl downwart and when þey hafe a purgacioun þey 
delyuerd þem of mych flewme with þe blode þat þey be purged 
of, and hire veynes ben whyght and mych drawyng to 
whyte. And if syche humours be resoluyd vn to wynde, þey 
fleen vp to he hert and makeþe a woman fal yn to a 
|P_33 
[\f. 61v\] cardiakull. But when þer ys myche malencoly yn þe moder, 
þei hafe litull lust to medull with ony man, and when 
þey doon, þere passeþe lytull mater from þem. Also þey felen 
mych colde and heuynes be neythe þer nauyll. And 
þei fele as it were a colde wynde meuyng yn þe modere, 
and yn tyme of hire purgacioun þei ben delyuered of lytull 
mater, and þat is medult with a swart yeloo coloure. And the 
mowthe of þe modere, þat is to say hire priuy membre, ys a stonyed 
and hathe but lytul lykynge nor lytul lust. And þer 
vryn is sum tyme swart yelowe, sum tyme þynne and 
febull of coloure. But when þer is mych colre in þe moder, 
þey felen hete þeryn, ache and prycchynge and hardnesse, and 
þei ben hote a boute þe mowthe of þe modre, and hafe gret 
desyre to man þat tyme, and sone þey delyuer þem of mater 
but it ys but lytull in quantite, and yn tyme of þer purgacioun, 
if þey be delyuerd of ony blode, it is but lytull and of swart 
rede coloure. [}For to helpe hem of þis sekenesse.}] 
Ther ben mony dyuerse medycynes as blode lettynge 
yn oþer placyes to delyuer þem of blode þat þey may not be 
purget of, and þat is profetabull, lest þei fall in to a cardiacle 
or yn to a dropcy, as atte veynes of þe gret toon. Or to 
be garsed, or þe legges be neyþe þe sparlyuere boþe 
be fore and be hynde, or to be copped be neythe þe pappys 
ore be neyþe þe reygnes be hynde. Or stwe þem yn erbys 
to opon the weynes of þe modere þat þe blode may rathere 
hafe ys yschoe, and if þe stoppynge be caused of colre, 
let make þem a stew of herbes þat ben openynge, as of 
pollypodion, sauyn, madyre, rosmarye, comyne, affodyll, 
mugwort, calament, and syche oþer, and let þem syt on 
a sege stole ouer þe erbes, when þey are wele y soden and 
hote, and þer with let þem drinke a drawte of wyne þat polipodion 
and mugwort ar soden yn. And som tyme let 
make hire right wrothe, and oþer whyles right sory, and 
|P_35 
[\f. 62r\] som tyme ryght mery. And let here vse hote sauces, and 
kene as garlek, and ofte let baþe þem yn bathes made 
of herbes a boue sayde and let þem walke mych and 
trauayl mych, and ete wel and drinke well and so þey may 
be purget hyghly of here blode. And a boute þat tyme of þe 
mone þat þey schuld hafe þere purgacioun, if þey hafe noon let 
þem blede a gode quantite at þe gret too, and yn a oþer tyme 
at þe oþer too, and euery weke ones. Let þem vse to be baþed 
in sych erbes be fore sayde, and sche may be holpen al yf 
hire sekenesse hafe dryed longe. But if þis sekenesse be 
of colde, furst gyf hyre þis medycyn to make þe mater more 
abull to passe a way. Take radyche, fenell, percell, 
dauke, marche, þe rotes of þese and not þe leuys, and þer to 
take þe leuys of rue, mugwort, sauyn, calament and origanum. 
If þou hafe not y nowe of al, take þem þat may be gotoun. 
Sethe hem yn vynegure tyl þei be well soden, þen clense 
yt and cast vn to þy vynegre halfe so mych of hony as þe 
vynegre is, and let þem too boyle to gedure a whyle ouer þe fyre. 
When it ys colde, let hyre vse þer of a quantite a ij dayes or iij 
but medull it with þe watre þat radyche and madere ben soden yn 
and þen let stwe here and baþe here with erbys a fore sayde, þer 
yn let hyre drinke a drauthe of wyne þat sauyn, mugwort, 
or madyre haþe ben soþen yn. And if þey hafe no purgacioun, 
let þem blede a gode quantyte of blode as y sayde be fore. 
Suppositoryes ben conuenyent fore þis sekenesse and þey schal 
be put in hire priuey membre as men put suppositoryes yn a mans 
fundament to purge hys wombe, but suppositoryes ordeynd 
fore wymmen schal be bounden with a threde a boute hire thyes 
lest þey werun y drawen all yn to þe moder, and it ys profetabull 
vn to vse þem a iiij dayes or v, be fore þe tyme of þe moneþe 
þat þey schull hafe hyre purgacioun and so þey may more esely 
be purget et certum. Oon ys take tyriacull dyatessoron and j 
+Q oþer of cocle, and as myche of mirre, and stampe þem to geder 
with coton, and make þer of a suppositore as gret as þy fynger and 
|P_37 
[\f. 62v\] put yt in hyre pryuy membre, but a noynte it furst with þe juse of 
mercurye. Or elles take þe rote of hook, or of mader, and larde 
yt with scamonye and a noynte yt with hony, and put yt yn, or amoynte 
oon of þe forsayde rotes with hony, and þen springe þer vp on 
þe poudere of scamonye, and put it yn, in like wyse ye may do with 
þe rote of lupynes þat is mych betture, and oþer take þe rote of 
marche, of þe quantite of þy fynger all grene and larde it with þe 
rote of pelettre of spayne, and syth put þat rote in erthe a 3eyne 
a xiiij nyght or iij wokes, þen take it vp and wype it clene and 
put it in here priuey membre, a day and a nyght, afture ward 
take it oute and a noynte yt with oyle of lorer or with mete oyle 
and put it yn efte sonys and let it lye tyl sche hafe hyre purgacioun

it oute. And þe same vertu haþe þe rote of accory if it be 
dyght in þe same wyce. But or sche vnderefonge þis supposytore 
þou shalt seþe sauyn and myntes and puliall and 
bay leuys yn watre and let þe woman setten ouer þat watre 
a gode whyle. An oþer medycyn. Take þe floure of cockell 
and medull yt with coton and make a suppositore þer of. An oþer. 
Take of pelettre and pyrettre ana +Q iii, of cockull j, of 
diagredion as mych, poudre alþes and put þem yn a 
lytull lynyn bagge as mych as a fynger, ty þer to a threde 
and let hyre put þe bagge as depe yn as sche may pull 
it oute lyhgtly, fore it woll make hyre a noon to hafe purgacyoun 
and if þe membre be fore with in forthe of þese suppositores, anoynt 
hyre membre with oyle of roses or of violet or with mete oyle and 
fresche butture. Oþer medicynes þer be weche if a woman 
drinke þer of þei wyll make þem to hafe purgacioun or delyuer 
hyre of a ded childe if þer is ony with yn hyre. As bawme y 
dronken and þe iuse of marche, of leek, or of tannesey, or of 
townecrasse. But and þis sekenesse come of sorowe or 
of angre, let make here mery and gif hyre confortabull metes 
and drinkes and let hyre vse to baþe hyre oþer whyles. And if 
|P_39 
[\f. 63r\] yt be of mych fastynge or myche wakynge, dyet hyre with gode 
metes and drinkys þat mowe make hyre hafe gode blode and 
make hyre mery and glad, and lefe heuynesse and heuy thouthes. 
 
[}Gode electuaryes fore þis sekenesse.}] 
Theodorycon emperycon and theodoricon anacardi, 
and trifera magna, and diaspermaton is þe best best of all þese 
to helpe wymmen of þis sekenesse et certum. 
 
[}Dropcy of þe modere.}] 
Dropcy of moder comes oft of wyth holdynge of 
blode þat sche schuld be purget of, and þen sche may not 
be heled, tyl sche be purget. Oþer wyles it comythe of wynde 
and of fleumatyk humours þat ben in þe moder, and if a woman 
swel with þis dropcy as and sche were with chylde, þer ben dyuerse 
tokennes to knowe oon from a noþer. Fore þis swellynge comes 
sodenly, þat oþer doþe not so, þis swellynge comeþ oþer whyles 
and sum tymes vanyscheþe a way, but þat oþer abydeþe 
tyl sche be delyuered of chylde, þis walkeþe from place 
to place, þat oþer doþe not so. Also þis hathe vncertayne meuyng 
but þat oþer comys certaynly, as at certayne tymes boþe be day and 
be nyght. But in dropcy of þe modere þe chekes ben nesche 
an[{d{] softe and febully colourd, but wymmen with childe be sum 
tyme wel colourd, and oþer whyles hard, þer is also a gret difference 
betwix þe dropcy of þe moder and þe wyndnes of þe 
moder. Fore wyndnes woll sone vanysche a way, þe dropcy 
wil not so. Also þe wyndnes ys som tyme on þat oon syde 
of þe modere, and som tyme in þat oþer syde, but þe dropcy occupeþe 
al þe modere. And wynde ys alway with yn þe modere and may not 
be with oute gret febulnesse of þe modere þat is not my3thy to 
defende þe fleumatyk humours þat ben with yn hyre, ne to put 
þem a wey from hyre. [}For to helpe þis sekenesse.}] 
Furst it be houeþe þat þe moder be purged of humours 
þat ben with yn hyre, and þat is tolde in þe precipitacyon of þe 
|P_41 
[\f. 63v\] moder and with yn haldynge of blode. Neuer þe lese, make 
hire a stwe of tyme and calament, origanum, sauerey, lauandre, 
rue, pulioll, mugwort and of loryf leuys and of þe croppys of 
henbane and comyn, and of euery kynde of marche, and þy 
let hire byde in þe stwe as longe as sche may, and when 
sche goþe oute of þe stwe, let plastre þe erbys on þe modere. 
 
[}A gode suppositores to purge wymmen.}] 
Take þe meyle of a cockle and medull yt with hony and make 
yt sad as paste is þat bred is made of, and wynde yt yn a soft 
lynnen cloþe and put þat in hire priuy membre, and let yt lygge þer all 
nyght or lenger if it nede, and if smart with yn forthe for kenesse 
of þe kockell, a noynt it with oyle roses or with oyle of vyolet or sych 
oþere as fresche butture. [}Fleynge of þe modere.}] 
Yt comeþe of kene coleryk vmoure þat cleuyþe a boute þe modere 
with yn forþe, and tokens þer of ben þese: brennynges, pricchinges 
and smartynge with yn forþe, and som tyme þe modere is by leuyd 
and scabbed with yn of sych vmours, and þen sche schall fele mych 
ychynge. For to helpe hem of þis sekenes. Let purge þem with 
þe electuare de succo roses, þen l[{et{] [{m{]ake þem a stwe of colde herbes 
and afturward let þem blede at þe veyne with in þe ancle. Afturward 
let temper hauer with cowe mylke and cast yt yn to þe modyre þorugh 
hyre priuy membre with a pyssary as we purge a man at ys fundament 
with a clistere, and do cast yn at oon tyme þe quantite of a pounde, and 
let hire be seruyd þus þe þrid day, id est from iij dayes to iij dayes til 
sche be hole. Or elles poundre þe seed of whyte popy and gummy of 
Arabyk and draggrantes and spodie ana, medull þem with rayne wature 
and make rounde balles of þem and when nede ys, medel hem with 
cowe mylkes and gif yt hire with a pissare at hire priuy membre. Also a 
noynte hyre with þe mary of a calfe, or with fresch butture or sum oþer 
sych softe þynge and in clensynge of þe modere of sych corupt 
vmours be war þat þer come no vyolent þing in here, lest þou make 
þe wombe baren for euer more, but vse þou þinges yn pyssaryes 
þat mowe comfort þe moder, id est matricem. 
|P_43 
[\f. 64r\] [}To myche floynge of blode.}] 
At þis membre comeþe to myche floynge in mony maners 
as of gret plenty of blode or of kenes of blode þat þorugh

or of febulnesse of þe womman þat may not halde þe blode with

If yt be in þe furst maner, þe womannes veynes ar þen ful of 
blode in dyuerse places of hyre body, and if it be in þe secounde 
maner, when þey hafe þer floures, þat is to say when þey blede,

And if it be yn þe þryd maner þe blode comeþe softly an[{d{]

stoppe þe blode of þis flooynge ne no maner flux, but if

hyre with mates and drinkes þat geren but lytul blode, as frute 
|P_45 
[\f. 64v\] and herbes, and let þem blede at þe veyne of þe arme, or

and acasia and colofony and make þer of a suppositore. Or medell 
al þese with þe juse of plantayne and plastre yt 
boþe before and be hynde vp on þe modere. Oþer medycyns 
þat staunchen þe bloode flux ben gode here fore. 
Gif it be caused of kenesse of blode let hyre blede a lytul 
quantite in þe arme, and let hire drinke a lytull ius of myntes, 
of popy, and plantayn eclarifyed and skemed and 
þat wyll staunche þe bledynge and if þou do þer to þe ius of þe 
daycy and poudre of galles þat men make ynke of, wull 
sounde and hele þe veynes þat byn brokyn þorough neschnes

in hire potage and violet to abate þe kennesse of þe blod. 
And let hire vse purslane and mynte and plantayn 
and rooses in medycynes to make þe blod to cese. And let 
hire vse comfery, daycy and galles and sangdragon, and 
mummy and bole in medycynes. Also a litull quantite of 
rayne water to sound þe veynes þat are broken. And take 
ceruse, þat is blank plumme, and almondes and mussilage of 
þissle and þe whygt of a ney and water of roses, oyle of

and let hire vse gode moton and fat hennes and all 
metes, ryes and frumenty make þyk mych mannys blode and potage 
made of orage and bletys make þynne blode. Also let þem 
vse zuccor roses and diapapauer. And þes pille late and 3eerly recipe

make þem of þe quantyte of a bene and gif hire too or iij

a sowkyng calfe and bren it alto powdere, medell þe poudre 
with þe forsayde pille, þei are mych betture. Also take hertes horne 
wel y brent and egge schelles well y brent tyl þey be whyght, 
but take iij so mych of hertes horne as of egge schelles and 
poudre al to geder and let hyre vse þat in hyre potage, in sauce, and 
yn drinke, or elles take lynseed all hole and sethe yt in schepys 
mylke, or yn gotes mylke and let hire hete it with fenygreke þat ys

ys gode to staunche þe flux. And if sekenes be of 
febulnes of þe womanys complexion, let hire vse confortabul metes 
and drinkes and 3uccor roset, diapapauer and þe ius of mynt resolued 
y clarified and so cast þer to a quantite of violet and sugar. Or 
elles take encense and mynt and sangdragon, mastix, violet and 
storage; medell all þese to geder with þe ius of plantayne and vynegre. 
And plastre yt on hire schare and on hire reynes. And if þis seknes 
be caused of brekyng of veynes, þen þe forsayde suppositorys 
and electuaries ben gode fore þem. Oþer medycynes þat be gode 
to staunche þe blody flux be gode here. As take a fat ele 
and ley it al quyk on þe soles and let þe woman stonde þer 
ouer þat þe smoke com yn to hire priuy membre or yn to a mannys 
fundament if þat he hafe þe flux. And in þe same maner doo 
with colofony. A prophetabull baþe for þis sekenes, and also for 
þe flux. Take a gode quantyte of reyne water, and þe fyfþe 
part of strong vynegre and seþe þer yn þe rynde of a blak plumtre
