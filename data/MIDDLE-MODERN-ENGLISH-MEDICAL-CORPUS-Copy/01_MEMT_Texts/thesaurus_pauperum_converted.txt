Brother I pray the for charite that thou write to me a fewe 
medecynes that I myght help pore folk that falleth into 
sekenes and beth vnkonnyng to helpe hem sylfen and of 
vnpower to huyre hem leches. My brother Ihesu Crist 
that is the principal leche of mennys bodyes and also 
of ther soules yeue me grace so to write and in such maner 
that it mow be plesyng to god and profytable to the peple and graunt you 
grace so to do your medecynes that thay may do the peple good that they 
serue god the bettyr when they ben hole. For brother god sendeth both 
good men and yvyl men dyuers syknes both for her own profite and for other 
mennys prophite and heleth hem aftyrward when hym liketh. For 
thaugh a leche telle what is a mannys syknes and what maner medecyne 
is good for that syknes and another man maketh his medicyne 
and yeveth it to hym it is certeyn that god is yever of his hele 
and but yf god like that a man be heled that travayle of leches avayleth 
but lyt. Brother hou is it that god sendeth good men? I leve 
wel that he maketh shrewes syke to withdrawe hem from her shrewdenes 
and to make hem thynk on hym in her syknes that ne wold not 
thynke on hym in thayre syknes. My brother for iii enchesons. 
On for they buth nat prowde of the godenes and the grace that they 
haueth passyng other men. And in this wise seynt powle was seke 
and thries he prayed to god to haue had hele of his syknes. And god 
answerd to hym and said my grace suffiseth to the for vertu is made 
perfite in syknes. God sendeth also good men syknes here for they 
shuld haue the more blysse herafftir yf they taketh her syknes in pacience 
and without grucchyng. And in this wise Lazer was syke that 
lay ful of buyles at the riche mannys yate and aftirward he lay in 
Abrahames bosom when the riche man was buyried in helle. And god 
punyssheth good men with seknes for the thrid encheson for profite of 
[\f. 29v\] other men. And thus Iob and Toby were syke to yeue other men ensample 
hou pacient they shuld be and thanke god in her syknes for it 
is goddis sonde that cometh both to good men and to shrewes for moche 
profite. Brother seth thou sayst that god sendeth men syknes and 
helth hem aftirward when hym liketh wherto shuld eny man studien 
in lechecraft syth god yf hym liketh may hele a man wythout leches. 
And yf he wil that a man be nat heled trauayle of leches nys but in 
vayne? My brother god yeueth his vertu in word in ston and in 
grasse and bestis for profite of mankynd and yeueth some men grace 
to knowen whiche thynges buth profitable for syk men and which thynges 
ben noyful and euery man shuld desire to dispende the grace 
that he hath to the worship of god and to help his bretheren and ther
for men shuld studien in lechecrafft and in al other craftis to such purpos. 
And thogh it be profitable to a man for to be syke and plesyng to 
god yet a syke man may desire for to be hole for to plese god the more 
and profite his bretheren also more in hele than he doth in syknes. 
And to this entent a man shuld yeue his brother a medecyne to hele 
hym of his syknes. And right as god maketh som men pore and sendeth 
other men riches to releuen him bothe for hur own profite and for 
profite of her bretheren that they releueth right so he sendeth som 
men syknes and yeueth other men grace for to hele hem for profite of 
hem bothe.

Now brother go we to our mater and telle me how many maner 
of syknes foloweth men for me thynketh that it were good 
to knowe. Brother ther be iii maner of syknes. On is cleped malice 
of complexion. That other is cleped malice of composicion. The thrid 
is departyng of thilke parties that shuld ben togedre. Malice of complexion 
is whenne the complexion of a mannys body is apeyred with 
[\f. 30r\] with hete other with cold outher throgh drynes outher through moystenes 
and such maner syknes ben feueres and ydropisies for in feueres a manis 
body is hottir and drier than it shuld be and in ydropisies a mannys body 
is more cold and moyst than yt shuld be. And yf such syknes be into 
al a mannys body than they ben icleped vniuersal syknes. And if they 
ben but in certen parties of a mannys bodie than they be cleped particuler 
syknes. Malice of composicion is when eny part of mannys body 
is other maner shap than it shuld be be kynde. Departyng of thilke 
parties that shuld be to gedir is when eny part of a mannys body 
is cutte atweyne other eny ioynt is out of lyth. Euery syknes that cometh 
to man is on of this thre syknes. Brother syth thou hast 
spoke of malice of complexion telle me what is a mannys complexion 
and wherof it cometh and whether al men ben of on complexion 
or buth nat. Telle me hou I may know a mannys complexion. 
 
[} Capitulo iij=o=}] 
Brother ther be foure humours in a man of the which humours 
a mannys body is norisshed and of thilke humours ben blode 
color malencolie and flewme. Blode is hot and moyst in his 
kynde and therfor men that ben sangweyne in complexion ben 
hot and moist in his kynde for plente of blood that they haue. Color 
is an humour that is hote and drie. Malencolye is an humour 
that is cold and drie and so men that ben malencolie in hir complexion 
ben cold and drye. Flewme is an humour that is moist and cold 
and flewmatik men be moist and cold. And euery man is of on of this 
foure complexions. And yf he be changed from on complexion 
in to another throgh mete or drynke outher moch travayle outher 
wakyng outher moche thynkyng or any other thyng he shal falle 
in to seknes of malice of complexion. Of these foure humours 
is the blode imade that renneth al about a mannys body and norisheth 
[\f. 30v\] the parties of al mannys body. And whan ther is moche color in a mannys 
blode then he is colerik of complexion and yf ther is moche flewme than 
he is flewmatik and yf ther is moche malencolye than he is malencolik 
vt supra and yf he haue moche klene blode than he is sangwyne. And 
me may knowe mannys complexion by hir stature and by hir colour and 
by hir maners. For sagnwyne men ben of medle stature and of rody colour 
and thay ben louyng and large inough in spendyng and good syngers and 
of lawhyng chier and hardy inough and benygne. Colorik men ben of 
hye stature and of yolow and blak colour hasty men and hardy angry and 
proude. Malencolik men ben of short stature and of pale colour and swart 
as askyn and they ben solitarie and gastful envious and of moche thynkyng. 
Flewmatik men ben of moche slepe and slowth and of moche spittyng and 
of hie stature and of colour white and they ben nat hardy to fyght. 
 
[}Capitulo .iiij=o=}] 
Brother telle me now which thynges maketh a man chaunge 
his complexion and whether a man be of the same complexion 
that he is when he is born into his lyves ende or ellys that 
he chaungeth his complexion throgh fallyng into syknesse. Brother 
a man hath two maner of complexion. On is cleped a natural 
complexion and that nys nat chaunged but is euer more of on 
kynd fro tyme that a man is born for to he be ded and that complexion 
cometh of humours and they ben in the sad membres of a man 
as of his bones and of his senywes and of his other parties but his other 
complexion is cleped accidental complexion that may be changed 
for that cometh of the iiij humours that ben spoke of rather and they 
may be chaunged in two maners. And so that complexion may be chaunged 
in ij maners. On maner is this: complexion is changed kyndelich many 
[\f. 31r\] sythes or than he deye ffor man hath iiij tymes of his lyfyng. In 
the first tyme he hath mochel hete and moystenes and so in that tyme 
he is of sangwyne complexion. In the second tyme he is hote 
and drye and so he is of colorik complexion. In the thrid tyme a man wexeth 
cold and druye and than he is malencolik in complexion. In the fourth 
tyme he is cold and moyst and than he is flematik in complexion and 
that complexion dryeth til a man be ded. And thus this accidental 
complexion is kyndelich changed withouten eny fallyng in to syknes. 
Also in another maner a mannys accidental complexion 
is vnkyndelich changed and than it maketh a man falle in to syknesse 
and such changyng cometh in many maner wyse as in chaungyng 
of metis other of drynkes. Also in takyng to moche outher to lytel 
of mete and drynk in slepyng to moche other wakyng to moche 
outher travaylyng to moche bathyng to moche or restyng to moche 
thynkyng to moche gret joye gret sorowe gret angir gret hete other 
of cold outher of drynesse outher of moystenes of the place and of the 
eyre that a man is in. Any of al thes may change a mannys complexion. 
Metes and drynkes changeth a mannys complexion ffor 
to such kynde as they ben of they draweth a mannys complexion. 
For hote metes and hote drynkes draweth a man from a cold complexion 
and cold metes and cold drynkes and moist metes and druye 
metes drawyth a mannys complexion to such kynde as they ben 
of. Muche wakyng and muche walkyng moche travaylyng and moche 
thought moche angir and moche bathyng maketh a man to wex 
coloryk. Moche rest and moche ease maketh a man moist and abateth his 
complexion moche joye maketh a man moyst and hote for the tyme 
[\f. 31v\] of his joye and aftirward and sorowe maketh a man cold and drie 
in complexion. The ayre and the place that a man woneth in turneth 
a mannys complexion to such kynd as they ben of both into hete and 
into cold in moystenes and in drynes. And while a mannys complexion 
is he shuld ben in hete and in colde in moystnes and in drynes that 
while a man ys hole but when a mannys complexion is vnkyndlych 
chaunged by any of thes thynges that we haue spoken of 
than a man falleth in to syknes that is called malice of complexion. 
 
[}Capitulo V=o=}] 
Brother thou hast ytold me nowe generally of complexions 
and syknes and of enchesones that chaungeth a mannys complexion 
that maketh hym syke. Telle me of medecynes generallich 
and what maner of medecyne me shal yeue a seke man whether 
medycynes that accordeth with a mannys syknes outher medycynes 
that ben contrarie to a mannys syknes. Brother ther ben ij maner 
of medicines. On is cleped a symple medicine another is cleped 
compowned medicine. A symple medicine is but of on 
thyng as oyle and herbes and rotes of herbes a watirs imade of herbes 
and wyne and hony and sedes but symple medycynes. Compowned 
medicynes ben made of ij symple medicines or of more 
and ther be many medicynes of that kynd as tretis emplastours 
oynementis pociouns that ben cleped drynkes electuaries sirupes 
watris oyles. Thes ben profitable for syknes. Tretis emplastours 
oynementis and oyles shul be withoutforth a mannys body and vpon his 
sore pocions electuaries sirupes and watirs ben yordeyned to ete 
and drynke to comfort a man wythynforth and for to distroye his sekenes. 
Also sekenes ben yheled with medicynes that ben contrarie to 
[\f. 32r\] syknesse and hote seknes ben yheled with cold medicynes and moist 
syknes with druy medicynes and druy syknes with moist medicines 
and syknes that cometh of angir and of sorow ben heled with joy and murth. 
But neuertheles otherwhiles syknes ben iheled with medicynes that ben 
accordyng with hem and nat with contrarie thynges for sores that 
ben ybrent or yscalded ben yheled with hote medicynes that draweth 
out the vnkyndlich hete and cold medicynes encloseth the hete within 
and in feueres that ben hote to drynk cold watir and mylke is nat medicynable 
but noyful and cold medicines yleyd upon a membre that 
is vnkyndeliche hote encreseth hete and the syknes of the membre. For 
yf a mannys hed be right hote and he put it in to cold watir outher in
to snow it shal be moche more hottir than it was before. And the cause 
is for the colde stoppeth the poores and closeth the hete withynforth in 
lesse place than it was before and euery thyng is of grettir myght 
whan it is to gedir than it is departed abrood. And so otherwhiles 
hote medicynes heleth hote syknes and cold medicines heleth cold 
syknes but temperat medicynes in hete and in cold ben most profitable 
for al maner of syknes.

Brother leches haue a queynt maner writyng and hard for to rede 
in makyng of hir medicynes. Brother when ye seeth in 
bookes of phisique thes writynges R. that is comynly the begynnyng 
of hir medicines ye shul vnderstond Recipe that is to say take. Ana is 
as moche for to say as of iche ilich moche. A pound is writen thus li. j. 
and li. ij and half a pound thus li. di. othur thus li. +s. A quarter of 
a pound is writen thus qrt. li. An handful is writen thus. M. j. Half 
[\f. 32v\] an handful is wryten thus M. +s or thus M. di. An vnce is writen 
thus +o j outher thus j vnce. Half an vnce is writen thus +o +s outher thus 
+o di. And a quarter of an vnce is writen thus +Q ij. Also a dragme 
is writen thus +Q j. And half a dragme is writen thus +Q +s outher 
thus +Q di. A scripulle is written thus +q j. And ye shul vnderstond that thre 
scripulles maken a dragme and viij dragmes maketh an vnce and xij vncez 
maketh a pound. And somme men take xvj vnces for a pound as marchauntes 
don but phisiciens for the more part taketh xij +o for a li.

Brother I pray the that thou telle me of hurtynges and of medecynes 
that ben good for hurtynges. Brother in many 
maner wise men ben hurt and in diuers places and som hurtynges 
ben old and som beth newe and right as hurtynges ben diuers so they 
haue dyuers medicines. For otherwhiles a mannys hed is broken other whiles 
ycutte otherwhiles ishoten outher ystekyd and so of other 
parties of mannys body. Otherwhiles the flesshe is cutte otherwhiles 
a veyne other whiles a senowe other whiles a bone and thes diuers 
hurtynges most haue dyuers medicines. Yef a mannys hed be 
bruysed with a staff with out brekyng of the skynne first me most 
iweten whether the sculle be broken or no and also whether eny 
of the ij skynnes that goth about the brayne ben apeyred or no the 
which skynnes ben icalled in Latyn pia mater and dura mater. Of the 
brekyng of the sculle thes ben the tokenes. A man leseth both his apetite 
and the defying of his mete he waketh moche and slepeth heuely he 
maketh vryne with grevance he goth to pryue with greuance also 
he falleth into som feuere vnnethe he may breke an note betwene his 
[\f. 33r\] teth and yt greues hym to chaw crustes outher hard bred. Thes ben the 
toknes of brekyng of a mannys sculle whether the hurtyng be with woundes
or without wound. And yf the sculle be tobroken it is drede lest eny 
of the ij skynnes be tobroken that goth aboute the brayne. Yf dura 
mater is tobroken outher ihurt that is the vtter skyn thou shalt jknow 
be thes signes. The hed aketh and his chekis waxeth red and his jen 
appeyreth both of colour and of sight and his tong blaketh. But yf pia 
mater is hurt that is the jnner skynne hym lakketh slep and his speche 
waxeth smal and his sight wexeth dulle and out of his nesethrulles 
outher his eris floweth blood outher quyttour and he is costeffe 
and twies or thries in a day he falleth into an axcesse of the feuere 
and that is a perilous signe for that is the signe of deth. Otherwiles 
the skynne is bowen inward with a stroke and not broken. Than he shal 
wake moche and slepe litel and when he slepeth he hath a gret trauayle 
in his slep. He is frentyk and fareth as though he wold arise vp 
and taken wepen for to fyght. Otherwhiles the hed is toswolle with 
the strok and the sculle nat apeyred and thou myght jknow be the 
signes that be contrarie to the tother signes that we told of rather 
for he may ete wel and drynk wel and slepe wel and he falleth in
to no feuere for his hurtyng. And there as thes toknes ben yt is certeyn 
that neyther the scolle neyther the skynnes that wryeth the brayn 
be nat hurt. And yf the hed swelle without brekyng of the sculle than 
it shal be heled with medicines that mow dissolue the swellyng as 
with emplastours imade with mogwort and rywe wermot and comyn 
and oynons iponed al to gedir and sith isoden in mete oyle. 
This emplaster shal be often ichanged for to the swellyng be abated. 
 
[\f. 33v\] And if the swellyng abateth nat than yt semeth the mater wil torne in
to quyttir and than lay theron plastres for to ripe it. Take therto emplastour 
made of wermot and of hokkes and mogwort of euerich of hem an handful 
and poune hem to gedir with iiij vnces of swynes grece and cast therto 
iiij vnces of whete mele and a litel wyne and iij of hony and sethe this 
to gedir to the thiknes of the emplastour and ley it on the swellyng 
for to it be ripe to breke. And thes beth the toknes of rypyng: ache or 
pricchyng in the sore and nesshyng of the sore. And when it is fullich 
ripe open it and in the lowest place and thrust out the quyttour clene 
and hele it vp with this trete: take the just of merch ruyen 
floure hony and swynes grece and medle al thes to gedir and ley 
thes on the sore til the quyttour be clene ygadred out and the hyenes 
of the sore be abated and the moystenes also. And than be aboute to 
fylle the hole of the sore with flesshe and that thou shalt do in 
this wise: cast encense and mastyk pich ipoudred and wax to the trete 
that thou madest tofore and so hele vp the sore. And with this trete thou 
maist hele al maner rysyng and eke bocches aftir that they be brokyn 
and yf thou be in doute lest the flessh wol festir cast alume 
ypoudred in the sore and thou shal help it and save the flesh from festring. 
And when the flessh is regendred hie ynough yf thou wilt that it 
be nat moche asene ley theron the red 
oynement outher apostolicon 
outher medle old gottes chece with hony and ley theron.
