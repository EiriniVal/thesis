[^SECREET OF SECREETES^] 
 
|P_330 
[\f. 49\] [}Of the difference of astronomye}] 
ALexendre deere sonne, I pray the, and it may be, that thou 
nothir ryse nor sitte, nor eite nor drinke, nor do no thinge, with-oute 
the counseill of som notable clerke that hath the perfeccion 
of the science of astronomye. Lating the wite for certayn, that the 
gloriouse God hath mad no thinge withoute cause and grete reson. 
And by this weye the noble doctoure Plato laboured to enquere 
and vndirstand of alle thinges that ben made and composed of the 
f[{ou{]re qualitees and humors contrarye. And so he had the knowlege 
of alle thinge that is create. And more-ouer I pray the, gyue 
nothir feith nor credence to som foolys that seyn that the science 
of constillacions of the planetes [\f. 49v\] may nat ben vndirstande, for 
truly they wote nat what they seyn. Latinge the wite, that to the 
|P_332 
vndirstandinge of man is no thinge impossible. There ben othir 
that ben litle wyser, that holden oppinion that [{at{] the first making 
of all thinges oure Lorde ordeyned of euery thinge what shall falle 
in conclusion, and by this means astronomye shuld nat be nedefull 
nor profitable to no man. Suche men ben foolys, and wote nat 
what they seyn. For yf a thinge most nedys falle, thou shalt the 
more easely bere it and the more temperatly suffre it with lesse 
greuaunce. And by this ensaumple, whan thou vndirstandyst that 
wynter is comyng, thou makyst thy purueaunce of woode, cole, 
and othir nedfull thingis, wherby thou suffrest the more easely 
and with lesse peyne the feruent colde and sharpnesse of wyntyr. 
And in the same wyse of somyr, to eite colde meytes, and ordeyne 
for the grete hete. And also whan a grete famyn and hungre shuld 
come, to make thy purueaunce of corne and of all othir vitailes, 
for to passe it more lightly, and suffre bittyr perilles of hungre. 
Than it is behouefull and expedient to knowe the thinges that 
may falle. And yf thou vndirstande a perill comynge, wherto thou 
can finde no remedye, than with thy good peeple make deuoute 
prayer to oure Creatoure that so hath ordeyned, that of His diuine 
grace He may turne the perilles to an othir weye. And thinke nat 
that God hath ordeyned the destinyes of alle thinges in suche 
wise but He may breke thaim as Hym liketh best. Right dere sonne, 
I lat the wite that the good peeple may [\f. 50\] so please oure Lorde with 
deuoute prayers, fastinge, oblacions, and allmes-dede with othir 
good deedys, that He will of His habundaunt grace turne and 
reuoke the perillis that the peeple douted so miche. Than turne 
we agayne to oure first purpose. Lating the wite, that astronomye 
is diuided in iiij. parties. That is to sey, in the ordinaunce of the 
secrees, in the disposicion of the signes, and of lenghthinge and of 
the meuing of the sonne, and this parte is called science of 
astronomye. The othir is to vndirstande the qualite and the maner 
of the meuing of the firmament, and the berthe of the signes vpon 
suche thinges as ben vnder the firmament of the moone, and this 
parte is called the more digne parte of astronomye, and is sciences 
of the sterres, planetes, and signes. And wite ye well that there 
be .M=l=xxviij. planetes fixed and stabled, wherof we shall make 
mencion hereaftir. 
 
|P_334 
[}Of the gouernaunce of thaim that ben seeke}] 
DIere sonne, I lat the wite that alle the wyse and naturall philosophirs 
sayn that man is made and fourmed with .iiij. elementes 
contrarye, whiche most all-wey be susteyned with meyte and 
drinke. And yf the nature of man be nat fedde and susteyned with 
meyte and drinke, the substaunce most nedys be corrupt and failled. 
Neuerthelesse, yf he shulde eite and drinke alwey he shuld be the 
weyker and falle to seekenesse and grete inconuenientes. But yf 
the man eite and drinke temperatly and by reson, he shall finde 
therynne grete helpe, strengthe and helthe of his body [\f. 50v\] and 
membres. The wyse philosophers seyn all of oon accorde that 
yf the man passe the cours of nature and temperate maner of 
lyuinge by, in etynge or drinkinge to miche, slepinge or wakinge 
to miche, or going or restinge to miche, or going to miche or to 
litle to pryuee, or in latinge bloode to miche or litle, he most 
needys falle into grete seekenesse. And the philosophirs seyn of 
oon accorde that he that kepith him from etynge and drinking 
to miche, with the circumstaunces aboue rehercid, kepinge temperaunce, 
he shall haue hele and longe lyf. And for certayn, I finde 
no philosophre but he kepith this oppinion, saying that all the 
delites of this world, be it in delicious meytes, in richesse, worship, 
or in flesshly desires, ben nat ordeyned but for to endure and lyue 
lenger, and sith it is soo that man desireth longe to lyue and endure, 
he most diligentlye doo and perfourme that that longeth therto 
with mesurable temperaunce. Also I haue herd of Ipocras, that 
kept certayn dietes to lyue and endure the lenger, nat to lyue 
and endure for to eite and drinke. And it is holsum at som tymes 
to pourge the superfluitees and ille humours that ben with-ynne 
the body. 
 
[}In how many maners helthe may be preserued}] 
DEre sonne, I lat the wite that helthe is kept principally by .ij. 
weyes. First, that the man vse of such meites and drinkes as he 
hath ben norysht and brought vp with. The secunde is, that he 
purge him of the yll humors and corrupcions whiche greeuyn 
him inward. 
 
|P_336 
[}Of diuers meytes}] 
[\f. 51\] WHan the body is hoot and full of hoot fume, than grete meytes 
ben good and profitable. And that that is norissht in that body 
shall be mykyll and of greet quantite, thrugh the grete hete of the 
body. And whan the body is slendre and drye, than smale and 
subtile meytes ben good. And that that is norisht in that body 
shall be of litle quantite be-cause the condytes ben streight. And 
it is a grete wisdome whan a man vsith good meytes accordinge 
to his complexion. That is to sey, whan a man is of hoot nature, 
that he vse temperately of hoot meytes, but yf the heete of the 
stomac be bolden and growen with superfluitees of hoot meytes 
and hoot wynes, or by othir cause, than is best and profitable coold 
meytes for him. 
 
[}Of the stomac}] 
WHan thy stomac is good, stronge, and hoot, than vse grete and 
hoote meytes, for than thy stomac is likenyd to the grete fire 
that with his might brennyth a loode of woode. But whan thy 
stomac is coold and weyke, than vse smale and subtile meytes. 
 
[}The tokenys to knowe the stomac}] 
THe signes of the stomac coold and of feble digestion ben 
suche: whan the body is ill at ease, heuy, and full of slaugth, and 
the face bollen and gape often, and is yien [{ben soore and he 
bolkethe{] for[{th{]e right foule, avoiding ill sauoured wynde by 
the whiche ben engendred wyndy bollnes of bely, and with-draweth 
[\f. 51v\] thappetite of meyte. And theise signes betokne an yll 
stomac, therfore be ware of alle suche meytes and drinkes as ben 
contrarie to thyne hele. 
 
[}Epistle of grete pryse}] 
[{D{]Ere sonne, hou be it that mannys body is corruptible and 
often fallith in to corrupcions and sekenesse by-cause of the contrarye 
humors that ben in him, we therfore haue purposed to write 
in this booke som thinges that shall be to the needfull and profitable, 
whiche I haue drawen out of the secrete medicyne whiche 
shall be to the plesaunt and agreable. For at som tymes may falle 
|P_338 
seekenesse to a kinge whiche is nat honeste to shewe to the 
phisicians. And yf thou wilt cleerly vndirstande and considre my 
doctrines, thou shalt haue no neede of phisike, but yf it be in cace 
of bataile. Alexander, diere sonne, whan thou rysest from sleepe, 
goo a litle weye, and strecche out thy membres egally, and kembe 
thy hede, for the strecching of the membres yevith strenght, and 
the kembing taketh vp the fumous smoke that is comen vp to the 
hede in thi sleepe. And in somyr wassh thyn hede with colde 
watyr, and that shall kepe ynne the heete of the hede, and yiue 
appetite to meyte. And than see that thou be clothid in faire and 
preciouse clothinge, for the lyf and the herte taken grete delite 
and counforte in the sight of faire clothinge. And aftir, rubbe thy 
teeth with som barke or othir thinge that is hote and drye with 
a bitter sauoure, for it is profitable for to kepe thaim cleene, and to 
take awey the stenche of the [\f. 52\] mouthe, and to make the voice more 
cleere. And also vse oft to doo rubbe thyne hede and thy body, 
for that is holsom, and causeth the sparring of the brayne to open, 
and encreecyth the nekke, and maketh the face the more cleere, 
and amendith the blode, and causeth that the man is [{nat{] so sone 
balled. And see that thou be annoynted with good and sweete 
smellyng oynementes, for in the swete sauoure takith the hert 
grete pleasire, lating the wite, that alle thinge that is swete sauouring 
is to the herte meite norisshinge and grete delite. And whan 
the hert hath taken his refeccion in the good sauoure, than the 
blode rennyth in grete myrth in alle the veynes of the body. And at 
som tymes thou shall take a lectuarie of a woode called aloe, whiche 
thou shall finde writen in the booke of medicines, and also of 
reuballe, whiche is a precious herbe, to the weight of .iiij. pens, 
and this shall take the fleume from thy mouthe and stomac, and 
yiueth hete to the body, and driueth awey the wynde, and yiueth 
good sauoure. Moreouer I counseile the that thou comon often 
with the noble and wise men of thy reame, of alle suche maters as 
thou hast a-doo, and gouerne thaim graciously aftir the custumes. 
 
[}The maner to trauayle}] 
WHan thyne appetite comyth to eite, and the houre accustumed 
is come, than take a litle trauayle before thy meyte, that is to sey, in 
walkinge or dooyng som occupacion, and that helpeth well the 
|P_340 
[\f. 52v\] body, and dryeth a-wey the wyndynesse, and maketh the body 
mightier and lighter, and counforteth the stomac, and wasteth 
the yll humours of the body, and causeth the fleume of the stomac 
to descende. 
 
[}The maner to eyte}] 
DEre sonne, whan the meite is before the, eite of that that thou 
desirest mooste, with brede that is resonable laken with leueyn, 
and eite first the meite that aught to be eiten first. And yf man 
haue ij. maner of meites, that is to sey, of harde digestion and of 
soft, he aught first to eite the meyte of hard digestion, and after to 
eite of that that is of soft digestion, for in the botome of the stomac 
is gretter hete to digeste the meyte, for the hete of the lyuer is 
nygh, which causeth the meyte to boile in the stomac. 
 
[}Of abstinence}] 
WHan thou eytist, halde the streight vp, and eite by layser, 
though thou haue grete appetite to thy meyte. For yf thou eite to 
hastilye, the humours multiplie and ouercharge the stomac, to thy 
grete hurt, and greuaunce of the body, and the more abideth in 
the botome of the stomac. 
 
[}Of drinkinge of pure watyr}] 
ALso d[{r{]inke nat pure watyr, and in speciall after that thou 
hast eyten thy meyte, but if thou haue vsed i[{t{] custumablely,for 
the colde watyr [\f. 53\] that is drunken aftir thy meyte coldith thy 
stomac, and qwenchith and lettith the hete of digestion, to the 
greuaunce of the body. And yf so be, for the grete habundaunce of 
hete in thy body or stomac, or through hote meytes, thou most 
needys drinke colde watir, than take it temperatlye and as litle 
as thou may. 
 
[}The maner to sleepe}] 
AFter that thou hast taken thy refeccion, than slep[{e{] vpon a soft 
bedde temperatly. And first slepe an houre vpon the right syde, and 
than turne vpon thy left side and slepe alle that is resonable, for the 
lift side is colde. And yf thou feele any soore in the baily or in thy 
stomac, than, for a souerayne and counfortable medycyne, take 
a warme shert and ley it vpon [{thy stomac{], or elles take in thyne 
|P_342 
armes a faire maide and holde hir surely. Latinge thi wite, that 
trauayle before meyte is good, and yiveth heete to the stomac, but 
aftir meite it is contrarie, for than the meite abideth in the botome 
of the stomac, vndigeste, wherof ben engendred diuers seekenesse. 
And wilt thou wite that slepe before meyte is nat good, for it 
maketh the body lene and dryeth the humors. But the slepe aftir 
meite is good and holsome, for it filleth the body, and yevith it 
strenght and norisshing. And whan a man slepith, the body 
restith, and the naturall hete that is a-brode in all the membres 
draweth and resorteth to the stomac, and yeuith it strenghth of 
digestion vpon the refeccion of the meite. And than the naturall 
[\f. 53v\] vertu askith his quiete rest, wherfore som philosophres han seid 
that it is bettyr to eite at evyn than in the mornynge, and for this 
reson: the meite that is taken in the mornynge greuith the stomac, 
be-cause of the hete of the day, and maketh the body the more 
weery. And, in the othir partie, a man cha[{f{]ith himself with 
goinge or dooinge som othir occupacions. And for the grete hete 
that apperith in the noon tyde, the naturall hete of the body is enweyked, 
and enpeireth the might of the stomac, and causeth it 
to be wors of digestion. But for to take his refeccion at euyn, the 
body is the bettyr at ease, and lesse greeuid of the laboure of the 
day, and the hert and membres of the man ben in more rest, because 
of the colde nyght, whiche yeuith naturall heete to the 
stomac. 
 
[}Of kepinge of mannys hele}] 
THou aught to vndirstande, that he that custumablely takith his 
meyte at .ij. tymes in the day, and than brekith his custume and 
eiteth but onys in the day, it is yll and greuous to the body. And in 
the same wyse, he that is vsed custumablelye to eite but onys, and 
chaunge it, and eite twys. For than the stomac hath no vertu to 
digeste the meite, and [{it{] abideth in the stomac vndigeste, with-oute 
any norisshinge. And that is accustumed to take his refeccion 
at a certeyne houre, yf he chaunge that houre and take it at 
an othir, he shall in breef tyme apperceyue that it dooth him hurt 
and greuaunce, for custume chaungeth nature. 
 
|P_344 
[}How a man aught to chaunge his custume}] 
[\f. 54\] ANd yf nede constreyne the to chaunge thy custume doo it 
wysely, that is to wite, to chaunge it by litle and litle, and so by 
Goddys mercy thy mutacion and chaunge shall be good and nat 
greuous. And beware that thou eite no meyte tyll thou knowe for 
certayn that thy stomac is void, and that he haue digestion of the 
firste meite. And th[{i{]s shall thou vndirstande by the desire that 
thou shall haue to thy meyte, and thy spatill shall subtilye stire 
in thy mouthe. And yf thou eite thy meite withoute neede and 
appetite, it will cause the hete of thy stomac by processe to be as 
colde as the glas. And yf thou take thy meite with good appetite, 
the naturell hete of thy stomac shall be as the fire, and make 
good digestion. And whan thyne appetite is come, loke that thou 
take thy meite without longe taryenge. For yf thou make taryinge, 
thy stomac takith his full refeccion of the yll humors that ben in 
the body, whiche shall trouble the brayne, and enwyke the stomac, 
and the meite shall doo no profite to the body. And, in cace be thou 
maist nat take thi meite so soone as thy appetyte is come, and that 
thi stomac be full of yll humors, do so that thou may haue a vomyte 
or thou eite, and than a lectuarye or othir thinge that is counfortable. 
And than eite surelye. 
 
[}Of the .iiij. seasons of the yere}] 
OVre intencion is to declare in this book the .iiij. ceasons of the 
yere, and the qualite and propirte of yche of thaim, and the contrariete 
and difference [\f. 54v\] of the same. Whiche ceasons ben diuided 
as here-aftir folowith, that is to sey: vere, somyr, autumpne, and 
wynter. Veer begynneth whan the sun entrith in the signe of Aries 
and endureth .iiij.=xx= xiij dayes, x[{x{]iij. houres, and the fourth parte 
of an houre, that is to wite, fro the xth. day of the ende of Marche 
vnto the xxiij.=ti= day of June. And in this ceason ben the nyghtys and 
the dayes egall in thaire regions. The tyme is swete, the wyndes 
risen, the snowes meltyn, the ryuers enforcen thaire cours, and the 
humors of the erthe taken heete, whiche ascendith to the height 
of trees, and causeth thaim to florissh. The medues refresshen 
thaire verdure, all maner seede and corne springeth and groweth, 
alle maner floures taken thaire fressh colours. And the birdes 
renwen thaire fressh clothinge, and payn thaim to vtter thaire 
|P_346 
swete and melodious songes. The trees ben spredde with greene 
leuys and floures, beestes engendren, and alle thinges taken might 
and vertu. The erthe taketh beaute, whiche is like to the faire 
spouse that is clothid in riche and precious clothinge, which 
causeth to seeme miche fairere. 
 
[}Of the ceason of veer and what it is}] 
WEer is hote, and temperate with humor. In this ceason mannys 
bloode meeuith and spreedith in all the membres of the bodye, and 
the body takith perfite compleccion. And in this ceson shuld be 
eiten chikenys, kyddes, and egges till .vi. and no moo at onys, and 
eite letuse that is egre, whiche is called in som cuntree karioles. 
Eite also gotes mylke. And in this ceason is bettir to be lat bloode 
than in [\f. 55\] any othir ceason. And allso it is good to trauayle, and to 
haue the bely softe, and to swete, and walke, and to bath him-self, 
and to eite suche meites as will purge well the baily, for all the 
wastinge that thou shall haue through bleedinge or digestion is 
soon recouerde. 
 
[}The ceason of somyr and what it is}] 
SOmyr begynneth whan the sun entreth in the first pointe of the 
signe of the Crabbe, and endureth iiij.=xx= xij daies, xxiij.=ti= houres, and 
the iij.=d= parte of an houre, that is to say, from the xxiij.=ti= day of 
June vnto the xxiiij.=ti= day of Septembre. In this ceason ben longe 
dayes and shorte nyghtys. And in all regions the hete encrecith, and 
the wyndes swage, the see is pleasaunt and meeke, the aere is swete, 
as the cornys drien, the serpentes growen and cast out thaire venyme. 
The vertu of mannys body is fortified and perfourmed, and alle 
the worlde is replenysht with goodys. And this ceason is likenyd 
to the spouse that is faire and plesaunt in hir parfite age. And this 
ceason is hoot and drye. And beware of all thinges that ben of hote 
and drye compleccion duringe this tyme. And be ware also that 
in this ceason thou eite nat, nor drinke nat, to miche. And eite 
suche meites as ben of hum[{ide{] and colde compleccion, as the 
flessh of calf, mylke with vineger, potage made with barly mele, 
frutes that ben of egre sauoure, and pome garnadys. And drinke 
but litle wyne, and dele but litle with womman. In this ceason 
|P_348 
be nat let bloode but yf grete neede cause it, and vse litle trauaile 
[\f. 55v\] and litle bathinge. 
 
[}Of the ceason of autumpne, and what he is}] 
[{A{]Utumpne entreth whan the sonne entreth in the first degree 
of the Leon, and lasteth .iiij.=xx= and viij. dayes, and .xxvij. houres, 
that is to sey, from the xxiiij. day of Septembre vnto the xxij=ti= day 
of [{Dec{]embre. In this ceason, the nyghtes and the daies ben egall 
of lenght. The aire troubleth, the wyndes entren in thaire region, 
ryuers and springes discreecyn, the gardyn drieth, the frutes 
waxen ripe, the beaute of the erthe fadith, the birdes seekyn the 
warme cuntreis, the beestes axen the cauys and warme places, the 
serpentes seekyn thaire repaire, where they gete thaire liuinge for 
wynter. The erthe is as the olde womman that is naked, and passed 
youthe, and age draweth neere. The tyme is colde and drye. And 
therfore, this ceason, eite hoote meytes, as chykenys, lambys, and 
drinke olde wyne and eite swete reysons. And beware of all thinges 
that engendreth blac colour, as to walke to miche, or to mich 
leying with womman. And take no bathe, but yf it be grete nede. 
And yf a man haue grete nede of a vomyte, take it at noon tyme, 
for that is the warmest houre of the daye. And at that houre superfluitees 
and humors gadren in the bodie. And also it is good in this 
ceason to purge the belye with a medicyn called asmon and asmacon, 
and by alle othir thinges whiche withdrawyth the blac 
coloure and refrayneth the humours. 
 
[\f. 56\] [}Of wynter ceason, and what it is}] 
WYntyr begynneth whan the sun entreeth in the first degree of 
the signe of Aries, and endureth .lxx[{x{]ix. daies and xxiij.=ti= houres 
from the xxij.=ti= day of [{Dec{]embre vnto the xx.=ti= day of Marche. In 
this ceason, the daies ben shorte and the nyghtes ben longe, the 
colde is grete, the wyndes ben sharpe, the leuys fallyn downe, and 
alle thinges lose thaire verdoure for the moost parte. And the 
bestes rasoorten to cauys or dykes for the grete colde, the aire and 
the tyme waxeth blak, and the erthe is like to a womman of grete 
age, naked, and in decrepitude nygh to deth. And by-cause the 
wynter ys colde and moist, it is good to vse of hoote meytes as 
|P_350 
chikenys, hennys, moton, and othir hote flessh and fatte. Also vse 
figges, nottes, and rede wyne. And beware that thy belye be nat 
softe, nor blede nat. Also hurt nat thy stomac thrugh eytinge and 
drinkynge to miche, or with hawntinge wommen to miche. 
Neuyrthelesse, in that ceason the felauship of wommen is good, 
to take it temperatlye, and bathinge is good. Lating the wite, 
that through the grete colde the naturall hete gadreth in the body, 
and therfore the naturall digestion in the stomac is bettre in 
wynter ceason and in veer, than in the othir .ij. ceasons. For in 
somyr and autumpne, the bely is colde, and the naturall hete of the 
body is spred abrode, so that the stomac hath litle parte therof, 
whiche causeth the wors digestion. 
 
[\f. 56v\] [}Of the naturall heete}] 
ALexander, deere sonne, I pray the, aboue all thinges, kepe well 
the naturall heete of thy body. For as longe as the kyndelye and 
temperate heete is in thy body, thou shall haue good heele and 
longe lyf. Doing the to wite, that a man dyeth by .ij. sundry weyes. 
Oon is bi kyndely nature of age, whiche werith oute and ouerthroueth 
the man. And an othir weye is through accident casueltees, 
by glayues, seekenesses, or by som othir aduenture. 
 
[}Of the thinges that maken the body fatte}] 
DEre soone, that thinge that makyth a man fatte is whan a man 
takith his rest, and filleth him with diuers swete meytes, and 
drinkes swete wyne and mylke, and than slepe vpon a softe bedde, 
and smelle alle thinge that is [{swete, and in especiall take bathes 
of fresshe water, in the which be{] swete smellinge herbys. And tary 
nat longe therynne, for longe tarying enweyketh the man. And 
drinke no wyne but if it be sufficiently temperate with watyr, or of 
an herbe called alchemyn. And put som in thy wyne for it is of 
hoote nature. And in somyr vse of violet floures, of malowes, and 
othir thinge of colde nature. And take a vomyte onys in a moneth, 
and in especiall in the somyr, for the vomyte wasshith the body, 
and purgeth him of the ylle and stinkinge humours beinge with- ynne. 
And yf they be but litle humors in thy stomac, it will 
counforte thy naturall hete. And whan thou hast had a vomyte 
withoute violence, the [\f. 57\] body shall take his fillinge of good fatnesse 
and humiditee, and the stomac shall be well dispoosed of digestion. 
And if thou reule the vndir this forme thou shall haue joye 
|P_352 
and mirthe, good heele, reson and vndirstandinge, with glorye, 
worshippe, and victorie of thyne enmyes. Moreouer, I will avise 
the at som tymes to take delite and disporte and playe, and to see 
goodly menne and faire wommen, and to rede bookes that ben 
plesaunt and delectable, and were faire clothinge aftir the ceason. 
 
[}Of the thinges that maken the body leene}] 
THere ben certeyne thinges that causeth the body to be leene 
and drye and the weykere: that is to say, to eite and drinke to 
miche, to miche trauaile, to longe beinge in the sun, to miche 
going, to miche sleepinge before dyner, to be full of melancolye 
and pencyfnesse, and to be bathid in watirs that ben of sulphur 
kynde, to eite salt meytes, drinke olde wyne, to miche goinge to 
pryue, to miche bleedinge. Latinge the wite that he that bathith 
him the bely full, he shall haue seekenesse in the ynner parties 
of the body, and in the same-wyse cace, he that lieth with a 
womman the bely full, and also that aftir his meite rennyth or 
rideth or trauaileth to miche. Therof will enswe a grete sekenesse 
called paralatike. And he that often etith fyssh and drinketh mylke 
and wyne to-gedir, Ypocras seith he shulde be a lepre by lyklyhode. 
 
[}The first parte of the body}] 
[\f. 57v\] THe body is diuided in iiij. parties. The first parte is the heede, 
wherynne gadreth superfluites and yll humors, whiche thou shall 
feele and knowe by theise signes folowinge: the yien waxen 
troubelous and dymme, the browes swellyn, the nosethrilles ben 
straight. And yf thou feele any of theise signes, take an herbe called 
aloyne, and lay it in swete wyne, and make it to boile with a roote 
called pugilchiny, so longe that half of the wyne be wasted. Put 
som therof in thy mouthe, and kepe it longe ynne, all-wey wasshing 
thy mouthe, till that thou feele that it doo the good. And allso eite 
with thy meite the seede of whight mustarde, beten in poudre, 
and it [{shall{] ease the greetly. And yf [{thou{] doo it nat, it may 
folowe grete seekenesse in thyne yien and brayne, and in othir 
parties of the body. 
 
[}The secunde parte of the body}] 
THe breste is the secunde parte of the body. And yf seekenesse 
come therynne, thou shall knowe it be theise signes folowing: 
thy tunge shall be letted, thy mouthe shall be salt and byttyr, or 
|P_354 
ellys swete, the mouthe of thy stomac shall be egre, and thy 
membres shall be sore. Thou most eite litle, and haue a vomyte. 
Take a litle sugre rosett with aloe and mastic, and alle that eite 
to-gedirs. Or elles take som good spice confortatif. And aftir this 
thou shall eite with good appetite. And aftir thy meite take 
a lectuarye clepid dionision, whiche is made with aloe, galingale, 
and grasegrinte. And yf thou doo it nat, there may folowe doloure 
and seekenesse in the hede, and feuers, [\f. 58\] with impediment of the 
tunge and othir diuers seekenesse. 
 
[}The thryd parte of the body}] 
THe third parte of the body is the belye. And yf yll humors 
come therynne, thou shall vndirstande it by theise signes folowinge: 
thy bely shall swelle, and thou shall haue doloure and sterkenesse in 
the knes, and thou shall goo heuily. Thou most be pourged bi som 
light and subtile medicyne, like as I tolde here-before in the 
gouernaunce of the breste. And if thou doo it nat, thou may 
lightlye haue doloure in thyne hip bones, in the splene, and in the 
bak, and in the jointes, and seekenesse in the bely and in the lyuer, 
with ill digestion. 
 
[}The fourthe parte of the body}] 
THe fourthe parte of the body is the genitories. Whan superfluitees 
and ill humors gadren therynne, thou shall vndirstande 
by theise signes: thin appetite shall appeire, and a reednes shall 
come to the stonys and vpon the share. Thou most take an herbe 
callid apium, and fenell sede, and the roote of archemese or of an 
othir herbe called smallache, and ley thaim alle in good whight 
wyne. And of that wyne euery day drinke a litle in the mornynge 
with a litle watir and hony. And eite nat to miche. And yf thou doo 
it nat, it will enswe seekenesse in the bladder and in the lyuer, and 
thou nat pisse [\f. 58v\] easely, and so shall thou haue doloure in the entrailes 
and longys, and thus may it engendre the stone. Deere 
sonne, I haue red an historye that there was a mighty kinge 
whiche was assembled to the best phisicians that were in Inde 
and in Grece. And he desired of thaim to make him suche a 
medicyne that he shulde neuer neede othir hele. The phisicians of 
Grece seid that it is good and profitable to drinke euery mornynge 
twys his mouth full of hoote watyr. He shall be hole, and haue no 
|P_356 
neede of othir medycyne. The phisicians of Inde said that it is good 
and profitable to eite euery mornynge, fasting, certeyne cornes of 
whete myle and nasturcij. And me seemyth that the man that 
sleepith sore shulde haue no seekenesse by reson in his bely, ne nor 
he aught nat to dreede the palsye nor goute nor doloure in the 
jointes. And who that eiteth euery day alibi aurei, vij dragmes, and 
with oo[{ue{] passes and of swete reysens, he shall be sauf for fleume, 
and he shall haue the bettir memorye and the more cliere vndirstandinge, 
and he shall be sauf from the feuers quarteyns. And 
that eiteth nuttes and figges, with a fewe leuys of rue, he is that 
day sauf from all venyme. Moreouere, I pray the to kepe well 
the naturall heete, with humiditees in mannys body. He shall haue 
heele. Latinge the wite, that the destruccion of the body comyth 
of .ij. soundry causes. The first is naturall. The secunde is ayenst 
nature. That is naturall is for the contrariete of the compleccion of 
man. And whan age ouercometh the body, than he most nedys 
dye. The othir, that is ayenst nature, comyth by casuell auenture 
with glayues [\f. 59\] or seeknesse, through ill gouernaunce. And on the 
othir partie, it is good to haue knowlege of the nature and kynde 
of meites, for som ben subtile and som ben grete, and som is 
a meane betwixe bothe. Latinge the wite, that subtile meites engendreth 
good bloode and chere, that is to sey: good whete, hennys 
chikenes, eggys. And grete meites ben good for him that is hoote, 
and vseth laboure, and trauaile after meite. The meite that is small 
and in meene engendreth noo swellinge nor superfluitees of alle 
humors, that is to say, lambe, capons, and othir suche as ben hote 
and moiste. How be it that at som tymes suche flessh, whan it is 
rosted, makith the bely harde, hote, and drye, yf suche meite be 
taken temperatlye, whan it is hoote, it is good and profitable to 
the body.
