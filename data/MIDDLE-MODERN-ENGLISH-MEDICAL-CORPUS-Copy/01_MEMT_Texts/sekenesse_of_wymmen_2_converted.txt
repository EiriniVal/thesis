[^SEKENESSE OF WYMMEN 2^] 
 
[\f. 65v\] [}Suffocacio matricis.}] 
Suffocacyon of þe moder is when a womans hert 
her lyghtes ben þrust to gedur be rysyng of þe moder so þat 
þei lese hir breþynge & men calle it a cardiacle, for it ys 
a greuaunce of þe hert. For when þer comyþe a corrupt smoke 
from þe moder yn to þe hyndre party of þe head, and oþer whyles 
be þe rygge boon, and oþer whyles be þe brest yn to 
þe forthur party of þe hed. And for þe brayn of wymmen ys 
mor myghty þen hir hert, þer for þe smoke wyl not abyde 
in þe hede but smyteth downe in to þe hert and greueþe 
þe hert myche & makeþ it to close to gedur more þen it schuld 
do be kynde. And yn þis sekenes wymmen fal doune to ground 
as þey had þe fallyng euyll and ar swollon at þe hert. And 
þis accyse endureþe sum tymes too dayes or iij. And þis comeþ 
of dyuerse causes as of with haldynge of blode þat þey schulde 
be purget of, or yt comeþe of corrupt vmours with yn þe moder, 
or of corrupt sede beynge in þe moder, or a boute þe stonys 
of þe moder, for wymmen when þat þey comyn with men þey 
be delyuered of sede þat passeþ from þe stonys of þe moder as 
men ben delyuered of sede þat passeþ from þe stonys þat ben yn 
hir 3erde. And right as men fall yn to dyuerse sekenes for with 
[\f. 66r\] haldynge of her seed with yn hem, ryght so do wymmen. 
But when wymmen hafe þis sekenes or þei fall doun, þei fele mych 
ache and greuance from her nauyl donwart, and þey bowen hem 
doun to heer knees for greuaunce and halden þer wombe & clippen 
yt hard with hir handes and make oþer men to þrast þer wombe and 
þey halden hir tethe to gedur and aftur fallen downe as þei wer 
ded. Oþer whiles þey bete þe erthe with hir handes. And þis greuaunce 
þat comeþ of with haldynge of blode. Men schal best knowe it 
be þe pacyent tellynge, for sche may best wete wheþer sche be purget 
of hir blode as sche schuld be. But and it come of corrupt vmours 
þat ben in þe moder, þat may be in ij maners as of hote humours þat ben 
yn þe moder or of colde. If þe humours be hote, sche feliþe brennyng 
and prycchynge in þe depnes of þe moder wher of ben resolued 
hote humours and smokes þat disparpleþe ouer al in þe body. And so 
makeþe hir to hafe an vnkynde hete in maner of an agu. And if 
þe humours be colde, sche feliþe mych colde & mych heuynes in þe 
depnes of þe moder & þer of ys resolued a colde smoke þat smyteþ vp 
yn to þe hed be hynde þe rygge boon and be þe stomak also. And 
sche feliþe sum tymes gret greuaunc3 a boute þe splene yn þe lyft 
syde. And if it be of corrupt sede as y sayde befor, þen þe 
greuaunce ys with oute þe forsayde tokenns but neuer þe lees 
þe moder semeþe replete of syche maner of moystenes. Ffor to 
helpe þem of þis sekenes it ys nedefull to purge þe moder 
of blode and it be yn þe furst maner as of corrupt humours, if it 
be in þe seconnde maner of corrupt humours, or yn þe þryd maner. 
Neuer þe lees if it be in þe fourþe maner yt is for þem to comyn 
with man in lawful maner as with þer husbondes & elles þat and 
with oþer þinges sayde in þe chaptre of withhaldyng of blode þou may 
be holpen. Neuer þe lees þat tyme þat wymmen hafe hir accesse þey 
mow nat receyue no stronge medycyns to purge þem but, if þey 
be of stronge complexion and þer for when þey ben in þer accesse, 
medull oyle de baye and oyle of roses to gedre of boþe y lyke 
mykull and þer with a noynt hir armes, handes, legges and 
fete and do set an horne on hir schare with oute ony garsynge. 
And let hir smel stynkynge þynges as felthe y brent oþer houndys 
oþer gootes here or schepys horne or olde schoon or a 
weke weet in oyle tent and quenched a3eyn. Or elles 
[\f. 66v\] take þe poudre of castorye and galbanum resolued yn vynegre 
& as myche brymston and psillium & pensadanum. Put þer to a peny 
wy3ht of petroleon & do þer to, cast þer of on þe coles so þat þe smoke 
come to hir noyse and from þe nauyll doun wart to hir priuy 
membre let a noynte wel with gode smellynge oynementes & 
oyles and make hir fumygacyon be neþe forþe of smellyng 
þinges and as muske or 3elocassia, amber, camphory, encense 
gallia muscata, storax, calamus aromaticus, lignum aloes, 
bawme & cetera. Also in tyme of hir accesse doo bynde hir thyes 
and hir legges to gedur and frote well þe sooles of hyr fete 
with vynegre and salt & make to hir a fumygacion be neþe forþe 
of swete smellynges þinges so þat smoke ne þe smellynge 
com not to hir nose but let hir to stynkynge þinges as y saide 
be for and make hir to fnese with pouder of castory, of peper, 
and euforbe & peletre cast in to hyr nose. Oþer in tyme of hir 
accesse gif hir treacull and a noynt þe mowþe of þe moder 
with well smellyng oyntementes. A goode fumygacion for to 
wakynn þem yn tyme of hir accesse: take of pensadanum 
+Q vij, of galbanum +Q xij, of coost as mych of peper xj cornes, 
and a lytull bawme þo þat may be stomped. Stompe þem to poudre 
but resolue galbanum in vynegre & cast þer to doo þer to on þe coles 
and do hange hir hed ouer þe smoke. Þese medycyns schal be 
don when sche ys in hir accesse when þat sche is fallen doun 
but be for and aftur þou must gif hir medycynes to make hyr 
hafe a purgacion be for sayde. And, if þe humours be of colde 
þat makeþe hir to hafe þe greuaunce, do þe baþe hir in a baþe of 
hote erbys and when sche comeþe oute of þe baþe gif hir a 
drau3ht of wyne þat comynge and gynger be soden yn. And, if 
it be of corrupt sede, let hir be ofte tymes be garsed be 
neyþe þe sparlyuer, be hynde, and eke be for. And let hir blede 
at þe veyne þat is vndur þe ancle and at þe gret too and let 
grynde yn a morter louage and warmade & seþe þem in a 
lytull watre and plastre it from þe mouthe of þe stomak to hir 
pryuey membre and as myche on hir bakkes and on hir sydes 
with oute ony oþer þinge oþer warmode be hym self ryght wel. 
Also, take sal gemme & sal nytre poudre hem & temper hem with 
vynegre and salt watre and weet a weke of coton þer yn 
[\f. 67r\] and put it in to hir priuey membre and it wyll deliuer hir of 
hir corrupt sede. And let þem eschewe metes encresen sede 
boþe in man and in womman as ben yelkes of egges fresche 
flesche and namely porke, sparouys, pertriches, quayles, breyne of 
bestys, and stonys of bores, bullys & namely wulfes and also

be þe hete consumynge þe sede oþer lasseþe and mynecheþ þe 
sede of man or woman as herbes þat ben colde and drye 
as agnus castus & cetera. 
 
[}Precipitacion of þe moder}] 
Precipitacyon of þe moder ys anoþer sekenes when 
þe moder falleþe from hir kyndely place and þat may be 
on too maners wyce: oþer a syde or doun ward. If yt falle on syde, 
men may knowe be þe greuaunce of þe syde, and, if yt be 
dounwart, yt may be fall on to maner: oþer al oute of þe wombe 
or nat fully oute. If yt fall not fully oute, þei fele myche 
greuaunc3 aboute þe schare and a boute þe reygnes. If yt 
go all oute, þe woman may se þat hir selfe. Þis sekenes 
comyþe of with haldynge of blode þat þei schuld be purget 
of, or of corrupt humours þat been in þe moder makeþ it fall 
a doune or a syde or þe moder falleþ doune oute at þe 
wombe for paralicy þat þe moder haþe kau3t of colde as long 
syttynge on a colde stoon or for long a bydynge yn a cold 
baþe or of myche drinkynge of colde watre. And þen þe 
moder haþe þis paralicy, it falleþ doune at þe wombe with 
oute greuaunce or ache oþer whyles þe moder falleþe 
oute for greuaunce had in berynge of childe. And, if þe greuaunce 
be of with haldynge of blode or of corrupt humours þat ben in þe 
moder þat þrusten doune hir and oute of hir place wheþer þey 
ben hote or colde, þou mayst knowe be tokennys tolde in þe next 
chapter be for þen þe moder may be heled be purgacyons & cetera. 
But, and yt come of paralicy, do hir vse þe oximell be for sayde and 
syþe gyfe hir theodoracon empericon aftur þe þrid day and make 
hir a stu of calamynte, origanum, lauandre, sauge, carlokkes, 
[\f. 67v\] prymeros, comfery & rue. And þoo sche comeþ oute of þe stu, gif 
hir treacull with wyne þat sauge ys soden yn & þe next day aftur 
let hir blede at þe veyne vndur þe ancle and make hir an oyne 
ment of cletes and of oyle, of nottys, and wax fried to gedur 
& wrongon þorogh a cloþe. & siþe cast þer to þe pouder of encense 
and mastix & þer with anoynt hir boþe be for and be hynde or 
medull þe ius of cletys & of agrippa to gedur ouer þe fyre and 
þer with a noynte hir be for and be hynde from þe nauyl doun 
wart and þer a boue lay þe wull of a schepe þat is eschore & 
vn wasche or a noynte hir a boue þe schare and a boute þe 
reygnes with hote hony & þer on springes þe poudre of mastix 
encense & of hertys horne brent & of colofony or pycche & 
poudre of crasseed and þen couer hir with a skynne be for and be 
hynde. And for þese medycyns be gode if it be of colde humours 
with in þe moder but, when it comeþe of hote humours with yn 
þe moder, þen gif hir a lectuare made of rosys & syþe make hir 
a stu of colde herbys and aftur let hir blede yn þe veyne vndre 
þe ancle and a noynte hir with colde oynementes & oyles þat ben cold. 
Or take as myche of hony as of oyle and cast comyn to hem & seþe 
þem to gedur & weet þer yn wull vn wassch or a blak felt & ley 
yt from be nauyll doun wart and som what a boue. But & þe moder 
fall oute of þe wombe be neþe forþe, if it be when sche 
haþe borne a childe, let þe mydwyfe put yt in a þeyne with hir 
hande. But furst a noynte hir said hand with oyle and when yt 
ys put yn make hir a fumygacion of mathees or of dry oxe 
dryt y cast on þe coles beneþe forþe or let hir smell to well 
sauerd þinges. And if þe moder wyl not lyg3htly be put yn a3eyn, 
seþe warmod and mugwort in watre and put þe woman in þat 
watre while it ys warme vn to þe pappys and let hyr syt þer 
yn a gode while and, when sche ys comyn oute of þe watre, let 
softely put in þe modur a3eyn and hynde it vp with cloutes so þat yt 
fall no mor oute. But furst ley hyr reygnes hyer þen hyr schuldren 
& let hir ly so ix houres þat þe moder may resorte 
yn to hir kyndely place. & when þe moder ys yn, take poudre 
of galles, notmygge, spykanard, & of clowes and temper þat. Poudre 
with oyle of pyliall & put yt in a smale soft lynnen cloþe and make 
[\f. 68r\] yt of þe schappe of an ey. Þen put yt yn to hyr pryuy membre to 
let þe moder þat it fall not oute a 3eyne. Þen make a plastre of crassed 
bayes, comyn, & gynger. Hete hem in a vessell ouer þe fyre & siþe medull 
with hony & let hir lye ix dayes and in þat while diet hir with metes 
and drinkes þat sche go not oft to sege ne to make oft watre. Oþer 
whiles som wymmen hafe so gret penaunce þat þe skynne þat ys 
betwix þe ij pryuy membris brekes in too yn beringe of þe 
childe and all in oon hole and so þe moder falleþ oute and 
waxeþ harde. To helpe wymmen of þis myschefe: Furst 
seþe buttur and wyne to gedre þer with softely handfull þe moder 
and tawhe yt til it be nesche. Siþe put yt in softely a 3eyn & 
sowe it to gedre þat pees þat ys brokon with a silken þrede and a 
quarell neld in iij places or yn iiij. Syþe do pyche on a softe 
lynnen cloþe and ley it to þe priuey membre and þe stynke 
of þe pyche schal make þe moder drawe in to hir owne place. 
Afturward make pouder of confery and canell, & strawe þat 
pouder in þe sore tyl it be hole and let hir lye as y sayde be 
for a v or ix dayes. And ete and drinke but lytull þat tyme 
and kepe hir warme and þat sche ne ete and drinke syche mete 
and drinke as myght cause hir to cacche a kowhe. Also, to kepe 
wymmen from þis myschefe in tyme þat þey traueyll of childe: Let 
make a round þynge of þe schap of an ey of smal lynnon 
cloþe & put yt in to hir priuy membre or yn to hir fundament 
and at euery tyme þat sche enforseþ hir to be delyuerd let þrust 
þe ball in to hir fundament and it schall saue þe skynne 
from brekynge. 
 
[}Wynde yn þe moder.}] 
Ouer myche wynde yn þe moder yt groweþe wymmen mych and 
þat comeþe som tyme from with oute sum tyme from with yn and yt 
mekeþe þe moder to ache and to dwell. And tokens of such 
wynde ben swellynge & mych burlynge in þe baly and generally 
gnawynge and walkynge of þe wynde with yn þe moder. Ffor þis 
sekenes þei must vse electuaryes þat wyll consume and distry wyndes 
as dyaspermaton & diacuminum . Also, oþer þinges of leuys of coste 
as comyn, anyse, þe seed of fenel, stanmerche, caruy, louage, & 
of crasses, & perytory emplastred with oute and with yn in maner of 
[\f. 68v\] medycyn wil distry wynde. & comyn sod soft yn water or whi3t 
wyne emplastred with oute ys god. Off senuey soden & rapes yn 
wattre and þat watre wasche hir wombe well doune to þe priuy 
membre and yt also. And hir be baþed in watre þat hokkys & peritore 
ben soden yn and frote wel hir wombe with þe erbes and when 
sche comeþe oute of þe baþe, emplastre þe erbes al warme vn to 
hir wombe. Oþer medycyns þat ben gode for wynde in mannys 
guttys and for stycchys ben good for þis sekenes as a plastre made 
of caluer donge stampe yn a morter with gotes talowhe. Aftur 
cast þer to a lytul pyche and frye hem wel to gedur. So make a 
plastre þer of and ley yt vp on a pece of leþer and ley it warme 
to þe wombe. Or take þe erthe be for a bestys mawnger þat 
ys troden & be pyssed with bestes heete þat 3erthe a 3eynes þe fyre 
and ley it wher þe greuaunce ys. And let þem absteyne þem 
from metes þat ben wyndy as froo pesys, benys, fycches fryte 
and rawhe erbys. 
 
[}Ffor aposteme yn þe moder.}] 
The posteme yn þe moder bredeþe yn dyuerse partyes oþer 
whiles in þe mouþe of þe moder, id est in vulua, oþer whyles with 
yn forther. If it be in þe depnes of þe moder, þen sche feliþe 
mych ache from þe myrefe doun to þe pryuy membre & þer sydes 
swell and þey hafe greuaunce to breþe & to drawe breþe. 
But þe grettes greuaunce ys a bout her schare & hir reygnes 
and þis posteme ys gedred to gedre and caused som tyme 
of hote humours som tyme of colde. If it be of blode, þen þer 
ys mych pryching þer as þe mater of þe posteme ys gedurd to gedre 
and þey hafe comynly a contynualle feuer but not ful stronge, 
and þe veynes of hir legges be swollon, hyr vryn ys clere reed 
& oþer whiles dym red, and maner swart yeloo a boue vndur þe 
serkull. If it be of coler, sche haþe þe same tokennys but þey 
ben mor violent þen blode. If it be of fleume, sche feliþe boþe 
greuaunce and heuynes yn þe moder and þen vryn ys trobully 
& febullych colourd & colour of axen vndur þe cercle. If it be 
of malencoly, sche haþe mych heuynes in þe moder and þe veynes 
of hir legges ben swart yeloo colour and her vryn also. And so 
som tyme þe vryn ys of þe colour of leed and þey hafe an hesy 
[\f. 69r\] feuer. But, when þer ys aposteme yn þe moder and þe vryn ys 
whyte þynne, þat ys a febul sygne. Ffor to helpe wymmen of 
þis sekenes: Ffurst let þem blede at þe veyne vnder þe ancle. 
Afturward, yn þe furst be gynnyng of þe posteme, ye must 
vse colde plastres repercussiuis to drife þe mater a 3eyn ward. 
As þus, make a plastur of þe jnmast pylynge of hempe & of þe 
ius of solatre warmed and leyd to þe posteme, & ij or iij renewd 
yt a day, also a yeyenes þe posteme. A noynte þe wombe with 
oyle of roses or of violet. And if þe postem be of hete or of 
hote humours, let hir ete cold erbys as purslane, letyues, 
endyue and drinke þe watur of þem stylled. When þe postem 
ys full waxen, make plastres to make yt rype & nesch to breke. 
As þus, make a plastre of whete mele and lynsed or of fenygrekes 
meduld with lye but let not þe lye be ful stronge. Oþer medull 
with syche lye barlye mele and make þer of a plastre. But, and þe 
posteme be of colde vmours, gyfe hir yn syrupys and yn electuaryes 
þe sedes of fenel, persyll, marche, dauke, carue, & sych 
oþer. And þe by gynnynge of a colde postem, make plastres of 
origane, ysope, centorye, rue & celydoyne y soden yn wyne 
and ley it to all warme. When þe postem ys ful waxen, þen 
make plastres to make it ripe. Oon ys take whete mele & oyle 
of violet and hony, or make a plastre with snayles with hony and 
whete mele soden to gedur, or make a plastre of þe rotes of 
affodyl stamped with reysinges and dry fyges and soden yn oyle 
with lye wyne and oyle, or make a plastre of sowrdowhe 
soden yn oyle or of rue or of fenell soden in wyne with oyle 
or fenell seede so y sod, and do anoynte hir with hote noynte 
mentes as with deute or marciaton. Oþer þynges þer byn also to 
make þe posteme nesche and ripe as grece of an hen or of 
a goos & mary of an hert or of a calfe & reed waxe & oyle 
of roses & womans mylke with þe whyte of an ey. Þes ben gode 
boþe to plastre with oute & perfetabull also to be reseruyd with yn forth 
þorogh a pissare at þe priuy membre. And when þe posteme ys 
brokon, þou schalt knowe yt be quytur and corrupcion þat comyþe þer 
of. Take þen methe warmode and do þer to iij partes of dispumed 
hony and let hir receyue þe wey3te of a pounde þer of þorogh. 
[\f. 69v\] A pissary to make þe moder clene or ellis: Take oþer medycyns 
tolde a for in þe chaptur of fleynge of þe moder. 
 
[}Woundys yn þe moder.}] 
Also woundes of þe moder ben helyd with þe ius of plantayn 
and of solatre with whyte of an ey and þe ius of purslane & 
if þy veynes ben broke þei schull be heled with þe ius of centey, 
bole, sang draco, & syche oþer þynges and with mynt & with rounde 
astrology. 
 
[}Cancur of þe moder.}] 
Cancur of þe moder ys seldom heled. Wherfor þer of we speke 
but lytull, ffor physicyons say þat cancres þat been y hyd yt ys 
bettur þat þey be on helyd þen heled. But neuer þe lees þis 
oynement ys perfetabull and for ycchynge of þe moder also: 
Take a gourde þat is ripe and pare hym with oute & clense hym 
of þat þat ys with yn hym, þen stampe hym small and put yt in 
a pot ouer þe fyre with oyle and wax. Cast þer to þe poudre of 
mastix and schepis talogh and, when þey wel soden to 
gedur, cast þer to oli banum and let. Þem boyle to gedur well. 
Þen clense it þorogh a cloþe and þer with a noynte it with yn 
forth and þis oynement ys gode for brennynge and scaldyng. 
But when sych a sore ys a noynted þer with, ley a bouere þe sore 
y vye leuys soden well yn wyne. 
 
[}Ache of þe moder.}] 
Ache of þe moder comeþe oþer whyles of a ded born child 
þat ys borne on tyme for þe moder haþe gret lykynge & confourt 
of þe childe þat ys with yn hir. And, when it ys borne ded, þen 
sche makeþe a kyndely moornynge and wemytacion ry3ght 
as a cowe doþe when þat sche haþe lost hyr calfe. And þat 
sorowynge ys ache of þe moder. Som tyme þe moder akeþe 
for colde and som tyme for hete but þat ys full seldom. And if 
yt be colde, þen þer ys ache and prikkyng yn þe moder yn 
þe lyft syde and oþer tokenns tolde be for and herfor. Take 
pyllyall origanum and bay leues calamynt & hokkes. 
[\f. 70r\] Sethe þem & þer with wasche hir wombe from þe nauyll 
doun wart to þe pryuey membre. Þen take cloys and spycanard, 
notmyges, and galyngale and make hir of hem a fumygacion 
be neþe forþe. But for ache þat wymmen 
hafe when þat þei hafe born childe: Take rue, & mugwort, 
& camphory stampe hem wel to gedre yn a morter 
with oyle of pyliall and hete yt at þe fyre and wrappe it 
wel with a cloþe from þe nauyl dounwart. Also for ache 
þat comeþe of hardnesse of þe moder: Take saxifrage, & 
ground swyly, olde coule mugwort, hokkes, betayn, and 
do seþe þem in watre and do þe woman syt in þe watre 
vn to þe pappys. And when sche comeþ oute þer of, make 
hyr a plastre of hokkes, of wermot, and of camphorye with 
oyle of pulliol or oyle of bayes and hote. Ley it on þe 
moder. Some tyme when a woman ys delivered of childe, 
þe moder walkeþe from oon place to an oþer & akyþe for 
as mych as sche ys sodenly emptyd. Ffor þat take þe croppys 
of ellern, stampe þem, & wring out þe ius. With þat ius & mele 
and with eyren make þynne cakys and fry þem with fresche 
grece and þat schall cese þe ache & if hir warme wyne to 
drinke þat comyn haþe be soden yn. 
 
[}Greuaunce of þe moder.}] 
It comeþe yn dyuerse wyce as yn mysturnynge of þe 
childe in his comyng forth þat is when his hande or ys 
fote comeþ forþe be for, also of gretnesse of þe childe 
as when þe childe is well waxen or when þe child 
haþe cawth a drepcy and þat mydwyfe and wyfe ken 
be gretnesse of þe wombe. Some tyme it comyþ of 
febullnes of þe moder þat is nou3t my3thy to put þe 
chylde oute from hir and þis may be on too maners: 
as of sekenes þat þe womman haþe had þat haþe febullyþe 
hir myche, or elles for gret þought as when sche conceyueþe 
in tendre age. Som tyme yt comeþ of stoppyng of 
[\f. 70v\] þe moder and þat may be yn too maners: as of fatnesse þat stoppeþ 
þe mouth of þe moder as yt ys in fat wymmen, or of malecoly 
þat stoppeþe þe moder as yn syche wymmen þat with halden þe 
blode þat þey schuld be purged of or þat þey conceyued. Also it comeþ 
when þe childe ys ded born and tokens þer of ben: Oon 
ys þei fele no meuynge ne sturrynge of þe childe. A oþer ys þey 
fele gret ache and greuaunce a boute þe nauyll and þe second 
day of hir trauellynge hir mouthe stynkeþe. An oþer ys dysslucyon 
of hir face & of all hir body. Anoþer ys þey desyre þynges 
þat ben contrary to hem. Anoþer ys þei mowe not wel slepe. 
Þus þe seuon tokens schewen þat þey hafe gret penaunce to 
make watre and to go to sege and þey felen gret greuaunce 
a boute þe schare. And, if þat childe come not forthe as he 
shulde, þe mydwyfe may put yt yn a 3eyn and helpe yt 
with outen ony oþer medycyn. But, and þe greuaunce be of ony 
oþer encheson, make hir a baþe of hokkes, fenygreke, lynseed, 
warmot, soþern wode, & mugwort soden in watre and doo 
hir baþe hir þer yn a gode while. And when sche comeþ oute 
of þe baþe, let a noynt hir from þe nauyll doun wart with buttur, 
and with deuty, & with arogon & be hynde also. Þen make hir 
a fumygacion of spynacard & of þe rotes of coste. Also when 
sche comeþ oute of þe baþe, and sche be ryche gif hir +Q s of

þe rotes of cooste & mugwort in wyne & do þer to +Q ij of boles 
gall & let hir drinke þat when sche comeþe oute of þe baþe. 
Or elles temper borage with wyne & gif hir þat to drinke, or 
make a plastre of mugwort soden in watre from þe nauyll 
to hir priuy membre, ffor þat makeþe a woman sone to be delyuerd 
of child if it be ded in hir wombe and it draweþ 
oute þe secondyne. But let yt not ly to longe for yt woll 
drawe þe moder al oute. Also ciclamen y strawed vndur 
a woman whyles þat sche trauelþe makeþ hir sone to be delyuerd. 
Also þe ius of verueyne dronkon warme makeþe a 
woman sone to be delyuered & draweþ oute þe secondyne 
and makeþ a woman þat ys stopped sone to hafe hir purgacion 
of blode. Or let hir drinke an ey schell full of ius of leke. 
[\f. 71r\] or of detayne. Tokens when a woman schal be sone 
delyuered been þese: gret sturrynge and meuynge yn hir 
wombe and som tymes al þe wombe meuyþe vp to þe

þer ys myche hardnesse a boute þe nauyl and þen þe childe fast 
sturriþe to passe from his moder. Þen let stoppe þe nesche thyrles 
of hir þat þe spyrites may go doun to þe moder & conforte 
hir þat sche myght þe sondure be delyuered of hir burþen and

frote þe soles of hir fete and þe palmes of hir handys with 
vynegre & salt bawme emade in maner of suppositore makyþe 
þem sone to be delyuered and drawne oute þe secondyn 
also, but it makeþe hyr baren euer mor aftur. Also þe ius of 
rue and of mugworte makeþe þem sone to be delyuered 
of childe if it be ded borne in hir wombe. Also yt ys 
perfetabull to make hir to fnese with poudre of peper, or of

þe same plastred on hir wombe makeþe þe childe to com 
oute oþer quyk or dede. 
 
[}Secundina matricis.}] 
The secondyne ys a litull skynne þat is a boute þe 
childe in his moder wombe right as a þynn skynne, a 
cornell of a notte. And oþer whyles a woman ys delyuerd þer of 
when þat sche beryþe childe and oþer whiles yt a bydiþe still 
yn hir for febulnes of þe moder þat comeþe of mych fastynge, 
or of gret angur, or wrath, or of smytynge, or of longe flux 
of þe wombe, whech þinges often slethe a childe in þe moder 
wombe & þen þe moder delyuered hir of þe childe but þe 
secundyne a bydeþ styll. And þen schall þe mydwyfe a 
noynte hir handys and with hir nayles pulle oute þe seconndyne 
and sche may and elles make a subfumygacyon 
[\f. 71v\] of gotes hornys and of clees of hir feet so þat þe smoke may 
come vp in to hir priuey membre. Oþer take salt and axen of 
a vyne y brent temper hem with watre & gif hir to hir drinkes. 
Also makeþ a baþe of hokkes, holy hok, fenigrekes, 
origanum, and calamynt, & make hir syt in þe watre vp to 
þe nauyll and, when sche comeþ oute of þe baþe, a noynt

bay, arogon, & deute. With þe same anoynte hir sydes and 
hir bakke a boute þe reygnes. Also take þe ius of percely 
and of leken medel þem with oyle of pulyall & gif hir to

gif hir þen medycyns be for sayde. In case þat sche

Some wymmen hafe corrupt matre as quyttur as passynge

medycynes and, if þei be yonge wymmen, þen do seþe 
karlokkes or skyrwyttes in wyne & let hir syt ouer þe smoke 
þer of þat it come to hir priuey membre. Or take pulyall & make 
poudre þer of and put yt in a bagge so brod and so longe 
þat it may hyll boþe þe priuey membre of þe woman & ley it 
to & bynde yt well þat yt fall not a wey.
