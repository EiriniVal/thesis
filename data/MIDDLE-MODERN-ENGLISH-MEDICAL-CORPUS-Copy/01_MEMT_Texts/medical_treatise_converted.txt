In somere he beres a smal reed floure. 
Propere to syght is his coloure. 
Al dey agaynes vnderoun & none. 
He will hym sprede and vndonn. 
[\f. 8b\] And agaynes þe euen tyde.

Als sais maister Betanicus. 
It schal out cast þe fendes myght. 
And turne wykede mannys syght

[\f. 9a\] And also a womman of childynge. 
But moderworte most gaderyd be 
When þe mone is in ariete [\sic\]. 
3it says þe maister in his maistrye. 
This gres is better grene & drye. 
If he be gadered & haue his kende.

That man or woman has sum tyme take.
