[^GALEN, DE INGENIO SANITATIS^] 

[\f. 183r\] [}In þis book bene vii chapitres contened and in þe first he putteþ vnder what 
þing out of kynde a sekenes is conteyned}] 
Ri3t dere frende Nero as it acordeþ þe significaciouns of wyrchyng for to 
be considered of þe essencion or beyng of kynde and of þe sekenes so it 
is nedeful þat þe science or þe connyng of þe þings with w<h>ich curacioun or helyng 
schal be giffen for to be perceyued of þe same essencion or beyng. It is no3t profitable 
forsoþe þat þe significacions of helyng or curyng and þo þing with which it 
is helyd or cured be diuerse. Forsoþe what þing þat is it scheweþ <more> it self þan anoþer 
þing. Bot for þat al men bene acorded in þis it is no3t nedeful þat we dispute 
of þam siþen it is no gret þing ne no gret party of arte or crafte as metoycens 
þat is wirchere with experimentz supposen and demeþ. Þei sei forsoþe: When a stone 
is bredde in þe bledder alwais and <or> vtterly it is out of kynde. It scheweþ þat it 
awe for to be kest out fro þe body. Also wertys and þo þings which 
ar in þe holownes of woundes as fann fattenes pultez and such þings which 
vtterly bene diuerse fro þe body. What þing forsoþe falleþ or crepetur <ruptus> or brestyng 
of bowellez fallyng dovne or descendyng. And þat toucheþ to þe cheynyng þat som 
membre be mouedde fro h[{i{]s place. It scheweþ to vs þat we awe for to reuoke and bryng 
it a3eyn vnto his ovne propre place. Bot it is knowen to þe þat þe science or konnyng 
of þis arte or crafte is of none wytte or connyng siþen it is notifieþ vn to þe comon peple. 
Bot neuerþelesse þof al comon peple knowe þis neuerþelesse þei knowe not 
þe þinge with which þai awe for to <do and> wirke. Þis forsoþe is þe fulfillyng of þe crafte 
and in þe which lechys bene nedeful. Þerfor þe significaciouns ar to be taken 
of þe beyng or essencion of þe sekenes which þof all þai be þe bigynnyng and 
grounde of al þe arte and crafte of medycyne and a parte þer of. Neuerþelesse þai 
bene no3t worthy parties or dere sithen þai ar knowen to comoun puple bot þe 
laste science or knowyng of significacion þat scheweth þe bigynnyng of þe curacion 
or þe helyng . Neþerlesse þat when it schal be tretyd with experimentz it is called 
metoyce. If for soþ it be treted with reson it is called logice þat is resonable. 
Metoycenns forsoþe seiþ þat all þings ar to be treted with experimentes or experience. 
We forsoþe sey þat som þings bene knowen with experiment and som þings 
with reson ffor why all þings ar nower knowen ne perceyued with experience al one 
ne with reson all one. Bot it biho[{ueþ{] vs no3t for to dispute ymedly in þis place 
of þe doctryne or techyng of þise siþen ich þing is to be treted in his ovne place. 
 
[\f. 183v\] And syþe þe discipline of þis boke is no3t bot after resoun it acordeþ to vs for to dispute 
here with resouns al one þat we may see how mych resoun is more worthy and mi3ty 
þan experiment. Þerfor lat vs see wheþer we may encerch bi any crafte or wytte 
how we may putte <out> away þo þingz þat bene ouer mych and straunge fro þe kynde 
of body and turne a3eyne þe membrez to þo placez fro þe which þei be gone out 
and conioyne and festne þe separacioun or disseueryng which toucheþ to þe iuncture of 
þe body and wher <forsoþe> it acordeþ for to help to sich bi experiment al one. Bot it is 
knowen to me þat crafte and wytte bene of þe cures of sekenes bot þe bigynnyng 
al on of þis crafte is to be intended or taken entent to which is hadde of euery 
sekenes as exemple þus. Separacione of þe iuncture which is called dissolucion or 
lowsyng of vneuened. <It> is nedeful þat it be souded which separacion if it be 
in þe bone it is seid brekyng. If it be in þe flesch it is called awonde or 
brissyng. Bot neþer lesse þe separacion þat is called awonde <it> is made of cuttyng 
or scheryng brissyng forsoþe with out cuttyng. Bot our entencion scheweþ 
al þise þingz for to be souded. Neþerlesse it is to see wheþer þat þat it scheweþ to 
be entent may be perfourmed in ych place or no3t. Wherfor I sey sich þingz 
mow no3t bene perceyued bot of þaim þat vseþ and excerciþe medicine or lechcraft. 
None ydiote forsoþe knoweþ þat þe <unnous or> sinny parte of þe mydrefe and þe sutiler 
smale bowelles or entrelz may no3t be sowded. And also þe sutyle part of þe 
of þe [\sic\] cheke of þe tete <or pappe> and þe forskyn of a mannes 3erd þat be wounded of scharp 
humours may onywyse be helede <as> it schuld be heled if it war in þe flesche. 
Also þei know no3t wheþer þe breking of a bone may be souded as it schuld 
be souded if it ffel in þe flesch. Also it is vnknowen þat þe brekyng of 
bones may be souded of þat al one bi which it lapped and bounden. Also he 
þat is no leche knoweþ no3t þat brekyng of bones of þe heued may be souded 
with þat with which it is lapped or with a noþer þing. Also in passions of þe herte of 
of þe longez of þe stomake and þe lyuer if þei be of þis same maner or spice 
þei wate <know> no3t how þam awe for to be cured. Also þai wete no3t wheþer 
þei may be heled or no3t. Þerfor he þat is no lech knoweþ alonely þe first 
[\f. 184r\] entencion of þe þingz þat is þat ich wonde awe to be souded. Wherfore þe knowlech 
of placez to be heled and no3t to be heled is þe bigynnyng of þe accione or 
wirkyng of a crafty lech which is of tuo maners bot none of þe þrid maner 
þat is bi resoun and experiment. Bot it is opne [\?\] þat long tyme is nedeful in 
experiment of þingz to bene assayed. Reson for soþe and science is of comprehendyng 
þe essencion <.i. complexioun> of kynde of þingz <.i. medicynes and sekenes> and serchyng of þe substance of euery membre 
of his wirkyng also and of his helpyng and his composicion or makyng. With þe 
which science forsoþe may be knowen which passions bene curable and 
which incurable and how þe curable bene for to be cured. 
 
[}Þe .ij. chapitre in which he determineþ of cure of wondes þat bene in fleschy membres 
repreuyng þe Worchyng of Tesyke}] 
Wherfor I schal bigynne at som symple woundes as þus. A wonde beyng in 
þe ouerparty of fleschy membres is most symple. Þis wounde forsoþ if it haue 
medlyng of none oþer þinge <.i. cause or sekenes or accident> it is schewed þat it owe al only to be sowded. Forsoþe 
if it be holowe we schal haue double intencion in it for whi it is a compouned sekenes 
siþen þe wounde is separacione of þe innyng <or iuncture> and þe holownes for soþe is diminucion 
of lessenyng of a party of þe body. Wherfor som of þise entencion som tyme scheweþ 
somþing for to be incurable as a holow wounde þat no3t alonly haþe loste flesch 
bot also bones. It is impossible forsoþe sich maner holownes connably for to be fulfilled. 
Þe wounde neþerles schal mow be souded. Wherfor I sey sych þings may no3t be knowe 
bot with reson or with experiment <or experience>. Tesike forsoþe nouþer excersized resoun ne experiment 
ne sette no3t to on his party any þing certeyn ne schamed no3t any maner wise 
of his wordes in which he is alenge. Þerfor turne we a3eyn to hym askyng of 
hym how þat a holow wonde þat has lost flesch alon schal bigynne for to be cured. 
Bot I suppose þat he schal sey forsoþe <it is> to be heled with medicynes putte to genderyng 
flesch. Þerfor þan cuttes þu away for to haue refuyte for þi þat þu grauntes þat 
it may be heled with sych þings. Þerfor sei þe medicynes. Bot I wote þat he ansuereþ 
þat it is thure <encense> aristologye poudre of barlych ypoudred oppoponace sich oþer 
at þe last I sey wheynes <or wher> he hadde <þe> connyng of þis þings. Nerþelesse I wote 
þat he seiþ þat þei wer hadde or founden with experience. Þerfor sey what has þou 
added of þi party siþen it is knowen to þe comon peple þat a holowe wonde 
[\f. 184v\] owe to be fulfilled with flesch and þen has medicynes fulfillyng of holownes 
knowen of experiment. Forsoþe þu has experiment in hateredyn and wrecch as fleyng 
fro it ne þu art no3t worth ne my3ty in reson. Bot as I se þu <may no wise> be disseuered 
fro experiment. Whosom euer forsoþe may no3t schew reson of þat þing þat he treteþ 
of it is certeyn þat he haþe þe knowyng of þat þing <after> experiment. Tesike 
þerfor putte abak gowe a3eyne to þaim þat labours in experimentz al on. Sey þei 
þerfor how þai had þe discipline of þis medicyne þat is made of yreos aristologie 
and thure <encense> and how þei wist þe toþer medicine in which plantaun oppoponac 
also cathimia ywaschen is putte. But I know þat þei wil answer þus what perteneþ 
to vs þat wo serch and seke how þai war founden. Wheþer it sufficeþ no3t to vs 
þo þingz which olde men tretid of which seying sich þings afore addes to oþer 
þings. Þei sei jt is possible þat þise þingz war notified and knowen bi slepyng or 
dreme or bi any chaunce as if som medicyne festned or ibued with oþer þingz war 
3yuen to any man. Þise men forsoþ 3iffeþ now no reson what nede or necessite 
was to hym to whome <it> is 3iffen. Wherfor it semeþ all þise for to be aleugenesse 
and wodenesse. Bot þe þrid answer for soþe of þam is somwhat resonable. 
Som symple men forsoþe seiþ. Som man assaiand on þis wise medicynes sawe 
þat som my3t no3t som tyme gendre flesch in som mennes bodies þan he perceyued 
þat one medycyne acordeþ no3t euenly to all kyndes ffor whi in which astrology 
gendereþ no3t flesch. Thus <encense> schal be acordyng and conuenient and in which encense 
profetteþ no3t yreos <gladwyn> is seen to help. Wherfor he demed many medicynes for 
to be medled þat diuerse natures and kyndes schuld be helpen bi þo þings which 
ar conuenient to þam. Wher for I sey þat it is no3t nedful no necessite for to 
work on þis wise if þei know couenably þe kyndes and natures of þe body 
and of þe medicynes bot boþe þe vnknowe. Neuerþeles þei renne no3t in to 
mych errour medlyng to gidre þise simple medicynes. I trow forsoþe þat 
þai war medlyd of olde men and take þane as certeyn þings þat I haue 
taken of þam. Neþerlesse þis reson haþe to lytel sithen it is no3t profite 
after certayn arte or crafte. For why when þei biheld þis medlynge 
[\f. 185r\] þei know no3t tuo þings. One for þei medled no3t bot þo þings alone þat bene 
like in spice or maner. Anoþer for somtyme it is possible þat som medlyngs 
of <a> medicyne noye when oþer profette. Bot it is knowen to þe þat þei putrefien 
most if it be hete and þe body abounde of ille humours oftetymes fluyng 
to þe wondes. Forsoþe we be no3t syker or sure þat ne þe membre wounded 
putrefie or drye. Of þe same wise it bifalleþ of wex most if it be melten 
in oile. For whi al þise þings putrefyeþ woundes. Vertegres forsoþ poudred 
and putte in woundes engendreþ no3t putrefaccion. Neþerles it bringeþ forth akyng 
gnawyng and sich apostemes þat if abyde long in hem it schal gendre acrampe. 
Þerfor oile wex and vertgres on nomaner engendreþ flesch in holow woundes wherfor 
none of metoycens ymedlid þise. I forsoþe schal medle þise and oþer simple þingz 
to holownes neþerles in þat quantite in which it bihoueþ siþen þise noyeþ no3t for 
ane vertu bot for opposicion or contraried of diuerse vertuz. Bot siþe it is possible 
flesch to be made in holow woundes bi þe temperance of tuo contrary þingz wherfor 
it is no3t impossible flesch to be engendred of the composicion of oile wex and vertegres.
