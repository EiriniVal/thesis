[\f. 1v\] [}Regimen Sanitatis}] 
 
[\f. 2\] This booke, made for the rule and gouernaunce of mannis 
body to kepe him in helth and goode disposicion of body, 
was sent fro þe grete philosophir Aristotill to the nobill 
prince King Alexander, of the which here begynnith the 
prologe. 
 
O nobil king, if thou wilt diligently rede and vnderstonde this 
litil booke and tretice, and rule thi selfe aftir the doctrine, rulis 
and preceptis in this booke or tretice writtin, thou shalt kepe thy 
selfe in helth and goode disposicion of body, and haue continuaunce 
of long life. Yitt notwithstanding the doctrine of this booke, thy 
life may be shortid by othir chauncis, as of warre or othir perellis. 
To preserue the frome deth happyng by such meanis, this booke 
helpith not, but [\f. 2v\] onely to preserue the from deth which commith 
by sekenes. Here endith the prologe, and begynnith the 
booke of gouernaunce for the helth of mannis body, the 
which conteynith xv doctrines or preceptis, of þe which 
here begynnith the first doctrine. 
 
When thou rysist fro slepe in þe morning, first stretch thy 
lymmis, þi leggys, thine armis, thy shuldris, thy necke, thyne hed. 
This availith to sett thy lymmis in dwe ordre. Aftir þat, kembe 
thine hed, for þat openith þe poris of þe hed, that fumositeis which 
ascendith fro þe stomake in tyme of slepe by opening of þe poris 
|P_4 
may departe fro the. This doone, if it be somir season, wesshe thi 
hondis, bifore þu goist oute fro thi chambir, with colde watir, for 
þe coldenes of þe watir shettith þi naturell poris, and lettith þi 
naturell hete to passe from the, which wold passe if þi poris were 
not closid. And when þu commist fro thy chambre, walke [\f. 3\] temperatly 
a competent season bifore thou put thy self to any oþir 
occupacion. 
 
[}The secund doctrine or precept:}] 
SE that thi clothis be precious and ri3t feire to the eye, for beaute 
and preciousenes of þe clothis li3tenith and gladdith the spiritte of 
man, which gladnes of spiritte is cause of a continuaunce in helth 
like as heuynes of spiritte and sorow inducith sikenes. Hit causith 
also a man to be more quick in all his deedis, and þe bettir to 
execute all that perteynith to his office. 
 
[}The thridde doctrine or precept:}] 
Dayly in the morning rubbe and clense þi mouth, and rubbe þi 
teith with the leuis or barke of a soote tre and bitter withall, as 
with the barke or leuis of the bay tre. Þis manir of doing clensith 
thy tieth and mouth, and resoluith flewme, by the meane wherof 
thou mayist more clerely [\f. 3v\] speke withoute cowghing or speting. 
Also it excitith þine appetite to mete. 
 
[}The fourth doctrine or precepte:}] 
In þe m[{orni{]ng vse sum fumigacions. Let brenne such þingis 
a[{s c{]ausith a soote fume, as incense, juniper, gale or levis of þe 
baytre. And se þat þu receiue þe fume with þi nose, for þis 
openith þe clausuris of þi brayne and disposith well þi hede, it 
strengthith þi lymmis, þi shuldris and þi armis, it makith a[{ll{] 
þi face and thy countenaunce gladly, and prolongith þe from age, 
and lettith þe horenes of þe hede, and it conforteth [{all{] thy five 
bodely wittis. 
 
[}The v doctrine or precepte:}] 
Aftir all þis anointe þi selfe with precious oynementis and sweete, 
for sweete sauour is mete to the spiritte: it gladdith, refresshith and 
confortith þe [{spirit{]te like as holsum mete confortith þe body. 
Which conforting of þe spiritte causith þe hert to be glad and 
|P_5 
makith þe bloode pl[{aye{]full to renne in to þe veynis for the 
delectacion of þe hert. 
 
[}The sixte doctrine or precept folowith:}] 
[\f. 4\] In þe morning bifore þu [{go{]st furth, vse certeine electuaryis aftir 
þe councell of men experte in phisike. Also þu shal [{ta{]ke of þe 
roote of rubarbe iij peny-[{we3t{] diuerce tymes in þe morning 
bifore þi going oute [{a{]mong þe peple. For þis medicin profitith 
gretely to purge and remoue flewme from þe mouth of þe stomake. 
Hit dryith awey e[{uyl{] humours of þe body, it expellith and 
remouith fumo[{site{]is and wyndis within the body, it makith þi 
mouth to be well sauourid, and all þi persone. Entre thi councell 
and provide what [{is nee{]din[{ge{] for þi comon w[{eal{]. 
 
[}The vijth precepte or doctrine.}] 
If [{it{] cum to þe a grete appetite to et<e th>ough it be b[{i{]f[{or{]e 
þine oure acc[{u{]s[{to{]mid, yit [{thou m{]ay go to thi dyner [{con{]uenient 
[{acc{]ording to þin [{ap{]petite when i[{t c{]ummith, if it 
be gret. For ellis shall þi naturall hete labour vpon corrupt [{hu{]mours. 
This wise to folow þine ap[{peti{]te when it cummith if it be 
grete avail[{ith{] many [{w{]ysis. [{It{] st[{re{]nthith thi body and 
li3tenit[{h{] it. It kindelith þe hete of þi stomak and [\f. 4v\] remouith 
flewme. Which if thou wilt not ete when þi grete appetite cummith, 
it dullith þi stomak and destruith þin appetite ay[{en{]s anoþir tyme. 
 
[}The viijth doctrine.}] 
When þu art sett att þi mete, se þi metis be holsum, and in plente of 
diuerse kyndes of metis, and ete of þem þat þin appetite moste 
meuith þe to, but ete sumwhat lasse þen inowgh, and rise sumwhat 
with an appetite. 
 
[}The ixth doctrine:}] 
Ete þi liquid metis as potagis or sewis in þe bigyn[{in{]g of þi 
refeccion. If þu first ete þi substancial me[{tis{], and aftir þi liquid 
metis, it sha[{ll c{]ause a confusion in þi stomak. And if þu shall 
[{eit{] a[{t{] one refeccion diuers potagis, sum rinning potagis and sum 
stonding, ete first þi rinning potage, and aftir þi substanciall 
m[{ete{] in þe midd[{ist{], and last þi stonding potage, as ge[{l{]yis 
and such oþir last of all. Also se þi grete mete be et[{in{] first and 
receiuid in the botom of þi stomake, for þer is gretir hete þen in þe 
over parte of þi stomak, and þ[{er{]for lett li3t metis of digestion be 
lattir ete, for lesse hete is for [\f. 5\] such metis sufficient. 
 
|P_6 
[}The xth. doctrine or precept.}] 
Also se þi brede be made of pure flour clene departid fro þe branne 
and sumwhat levenid. But yitte in all þi diete for-gete not to leue 
with an appetite, for who so wille ete til he hath fulfillid his appetite 
hath more þen ynou3h, and so shall his mete ly in þe botom 
of his stomak not digestid. 
 
[}The xjth doctrine or precepte:}] 
Se þu be no grete drinker: þough þi drink be neuir so pleasant, 
numbir þi drinkyngis. Se þey be not verray many in one diete, betwene 
þi drinkingis se þer be a competent space, and se þi dra3t 
be not ouir grete, but mesurable. And aftir þi mete biware þu 
drinke no watir, be it neuir so pleasaunt vnto þe, for drinking of 
watir aftir þi mete coldith þi stomak and quenchith þi naturall 
hete. But if þi desire be so grete aftir þi mete to drink watir, for 
grete hete of þe season, drink but litil, and se þe watir be well tastid 
and verry colde. 
 
[}Þe xijth doctrine.}] 
When þu art a-rise fro mete, walke a litil vpon soft gresse. [\f. 5v\] And 
if þu wilt slepe aftir þi dyner, lett þi slepe be litil and short, 
and begyn þi slepe vpon þi ri3t side a litil season, and þen turne on 
þi left side and so make an ende of þi slepe. And be ware þu slepe 
not bifore mete, for such slepe shall make þi body ouir leene, and 
dry þi moisture naturall. But moderate slepe aftir mete shall refressh 
þe, and kepe þe in goode disposicion of body. 
 
[}Þe xiijth doctrine.}] 
When þu hast ete þi mete, be ware þu ete not eftsonis, vn-til þi 
mete bifore receiuid be perfitely digestid. And when þat is, þu 
shalt knowe by .ij. tokenis. One is when þine appetite cummith to 
þe ayene after þi mete which þu hast receyuid. Anoþir tokin: if þi 
spettel be sotel, and li3tly will destende in to þi mouth. Iff þu take 
mete withoute appetite, þi naturall hete is feblid. And if þu haue 
a newe appetite, þi naturall hete is accendid. 
 
[}The xiiijth. doctrine.}] 
When þine appetite cummith, sone aftir, fall to þi mete, for if þu 
absteine þe long fro þi mete aftir þine appetite is cum, þi stomake 
shalbe fillid with corrupt humouris which [\f. 6\] he drawith to him of 
þe refuce and superfluite of þe mete bifore digestid, and of such 
corrupt humours receyuid in þe stomac by abstinence of mete aftir 
|P_7 
þine appetite is cum, thine hed and þi brayne shall gretely be 
troublid by aking and oþir diseasis. 
 
[}The xvth doctrine tretith of þe iiij seasons of þe yere:}] 
Thou must diligently take hede of iiij ceasons of þe yere which þis 
wise be namid: Ver, Estas, Autumpnus, Hyemps. First 
Ver begynnith in March and continuith til þe hote somir begyn. 
Estas begynnith in þe monnith of June and durith to þe middis of 
August. Then begynnith Autumpnus, callid Hervest, and durith 
to þe middis of Nouembir. And þen begynnith Hyemps callid 
wintir, and durith til þe begynning of Ver. The disposicions of þies 
iiij ceasons of þe yere ben þies: Ver is temperate, hote and moiste, 
like vnto þe eyer. Þen begynnith mannis bloode to encrese. Diett 
according for þat season be boylid capons and chicons. Also 
amongis herbis, letuce be holsum. Amongis liquouris þat [\f. 6v\] norisshith, 
gotis milke is ri3t norisshing. Among grete flessh, yong 
kidde and fatte. Also as for bloodeletting þat ceason callid Ver is 
most according. þis season also is conuenient for laxis, and baynis 
drye and moiste, also to take aromatik pocions made with spices. 
And if ony þing hath happenid in þe yer bifor, by wey of medicine 
or oþir, þis season may all be restorid and refourmid by þe menis 
bifore rehercid. Then folowith a season callid Estas or summir, 
and is commonly excessifly hote and drie. And in þis season encrecith 
rede coler, and is like to fire which is excedingly hote and 
drye. In þis season þu hast nede to absteyne the fro replecion 
of mete and drink, and in manir vse abstinence more þan in Ver, 
and in especiall to absteine fro metis and drinkis þat be hote in 
wirking, and to vse metis þat be colde and moiste, and in sawcis to 
vse vinagre and sorel savce, and in fruitis to vse such þat be sumwhat 
egre, as orangis and pomegranatis, to vse moiste baynis 
mesurably, and vttirly to eschiwe dry baynis for þat season, also 
þen to be ware of letting of bloode, but if grete nede require, [\f. 7\] 
walking and exercise moderately according, in þe morning and 
late towardis ni3t. Aftir þis folowith Autumpnus or harvest, 
which is sumwhat cold in þe regarde of þe summer, and also dry, 
and is like to þe erth, which is colde and drie. And in þis season 
arisith and encrecith melancoly, callid in Latin Colera nigra. In þis 
season þu must absteine þe fro suche metis and frutis þat gendrith 
melancoly, as fro olde towgh bef and moton, fro olde gotis flessh, 
|P_8 
and in þis season þu mayist vse baynis and also laxis to purge 
melancoly. Aftir þis folowith Hyems, callid wintir, which tyme is 
colde and moiste like to watir. It begynnith toward thende of 
Nouembre and continuith to Ver. In þis tyme of wintir conuenient 
it is to ete hote metis and dry, as dove birdis, bakemetis well spicid, 
rostid gete, swanis, wilde foule, drink goode rede wyne and mi3ty. 
Also þe potagis se þat þei be hote in wirking and well spicid. Absteine 
fro laxis and letting of bloode, but if grete nede require. In 
þis ceason þu mayist vse oynementis and anoint þi body, and aftir 
rubbe it ayenst þe fire and dry it ayene. In þis [\f. 7v\] season vse no grete 
abstinence from mete, for þen mannis digestion is strong and mi3ty. 
 
NOw, mi3ty prince Alexander, kepe well this litill booke for þe 
gyding of þi body as a jvell precious, for by þis þu shalt kepe 
þi naturall moistur, and so folowith þi naturall hete, for so long 
abydith naturall hete as doith naturall moistur, in so much as 
naturall hete is radicate and kept in naturall moistur as in his 
naturall fundament and ground. Thies ij, þat is to say, naturall 
hete and naturall moisture, well kepte, continuith bodyly helth 
and life. And age shall not gretely grow vpon þe. For man waxith 
olde for one of ij causis. One cause is for wasting of naturall 
moysture, and grete drynes, wherof growith febilnes of body. 
A-nothir cause, which is accidentall, as by sekenes, wher vnto 
man fallith for lak of goode guyding of his body, as in þis booke 
is shewid. Thies be þo þingis þat makith mannis body well flesshid 
and not lene, but raþir moiste: to ete and drink moderatly metis 
and drinkis þat be sumwhat sweete. [\f. 8\] Att s[{u{]m seasons to drink 
warme gotis milke is holsum, and it preseruith well naturall hete 
and moistur. Hit is also conuenient onis in a monith to provoke a 
vomitt; it clensith þe stomak fro corrupt and rottin humours. When 
few humours be in þe stomak þen is þe body in goode confort, and 
is in goode disposicion to digest mete receyuid, and hath goode 
moistur. And þe bettir for helth and digestion if þe man haue ioy 
and gladnes, and with þat goode fortune, as glory, worship, fame 
and worship of þe peple, victory of his ennemyis. Also if he may 
beholde beauteuous parsonis, and delectabil bookis, and here 
pleasaunt songis, and be in cumpany of such as a man louith, and 
to were goode clothis, and to be anoyntid with swete oynementis. 
And ayenwarde þies be þe þingis which chiefly disposith ill and 
feblith þe body: to ete litil and drink much, to laboure ouir much, 
|P_9 
and stond oft in þe sonne, to walke ouir much, to slepe bifore 
mete, to slepe vpon hard strawe, to wassh in watir vnholsum, to ete 
salt mete and dry, as bacon or beefe, in especiall [\f. 8v\] such as hath 
hongyd long in þe smoke, to d[{ri{]nke very old wynes, in speciall ny 
the lyis, to be lette oft bloode, to haue þe cumpany of women oft, 
ofte to be in drede and to haue grete sorow. Þies be such þing þat 
bringith a man soone to grete sikenes and febilnes of body and soone 
to his ende. Here endith the booke of goode gouernance and 
guyding of þe body, writtin by Aristotill to þe full nobill 
prince King Alexander, to kepe him in helth and to preserue 
him in long life.
