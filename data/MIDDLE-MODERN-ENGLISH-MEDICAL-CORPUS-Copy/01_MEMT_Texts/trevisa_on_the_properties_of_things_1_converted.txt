ET DE SINGULIS EIUS PARTIBUS DE 
QUIBUS SACRA SCRIPTURA FACIT MENCIONEM. AMEN.}] 
For we haue ispoken of þe propirtees of humoures, now it 
falliþ to speke somwhat of þe disposicioun of membres þat ben 
imaad and componed of þe forseid humours. And first of þe 
propirtees þerof we schal speke in general, and þanne of eueryche 
somwhat in special. 
 
[}De membrorum proprietatibus in generali. Capitulum I=m=.}] 
Avicenna seiþ þat membres beþ bodyes imaade of þe firste 
mellinge of humours; oþir, as it is iseide super Iohannitium, a 
membre is a stedfast and a sad partye of a beest icompouned of 
þinges þat ben liche oþir vnliche, and is i-ordeynede to somme 
special office. And by þat þat he is clepid stedefast partie, it is 
distingued from þe partie þat is not stedefast, as a spirit. 
 
In þat þat he is maad of þinges þat beþ liche and vnliche is 
vndirstonde double diuersite of membres. þe firste diuersite is 
simple and of parties þat beþ iliche; þat oþir diuersite is compouned 
of þinges of craft and of office. For þe membres þat haþ 
parties of þe same kynde [{wiþ{] alle þe membres beþ iclepid 
membris iliche and symple. And so blood is a symple membre, for 
eueryche parte of blood is blood, and so of oþir. Suche simple 
membres and liche beþ raþir in kinde þan þe membres of lymes 
and of office for þe semple parties of þe lymes þat beþ icompouned; 
and þe simple parties beþ raþir in kinde þan þe þing þat is icompowned. 
 
þe membres and þe lymes serueþ to fele and meue and beþ þe 
instrumentis of þe soule, as hoond, foot, and ei3e, and oþir suche, 
and beþ nedeful in diuers qualitees and quantites to þe worchinge 
of þe soule. Kynde makeþ instrumentis of þe body couenable to 
þe vertu of þe soule. The soule haþ diuers vertues; and þerfore 
|P_164 
diuersite of membres and lymes is nedeful, as it farith in hondis 
in þe whiche beþ many fyngres, diuers in qualite and quantite þat 
þey mowen holde grete þinges as wel as smale. 
 
And for þe soule hath þre maner of worchinge þat hatte animalis, 
naturalis, and spiritualis 'of felynge, of kynde, and spiritual', þe 
membres and lymes beþ nedeful to [{þese worchinges of þe soule. 
And so þe membres þat folwith þe vertue of felinge beþe ycleped 
souled and ben nedeful to{] schape felinge and wilful meuynge in 
alle beestis, as þe brayn, synewis, ei3en, and oþir instrumentis of 
felinge. þe membres þat [\f. 37rb\] beþ obedient to þe vertue of 
leuynge beþ iclepid spiritualia vitalia, and beþ imade for to drawe 
breþ and spiritis of lif to slake hete and saue þe lif, as herte and 
longen and oþir suche. þe membres þat serueþ þe vertu of kynde 
beþ iclepid naturalia, as membra nutritiua þat serueþ to fedinge 
and norischinge. Some of hem lediþ and chaungiþ þe mete into 
þe kinde of membris, as þe stomak and lyuour and oþir suche. 
And somme serueþ to gendringe and to kepe and saue þingis in 
kynde, þat general be distinguid by special and special by synguler. 
For [{when{] alle þe singuleres schal be corrupt, it nediþ þat he be 
restored by þe vertue of þe gendringe, and so isaued in special 
beynge þat it be not al ilost. 
 
Somme oþir membres serueþ to þise membris generatif and 
helpiþ hem; and membris helpiþ eiþir oþir. þise membris þat 
serueþ beþ profitable in many maner wise. Some makeþ redy, some 
purgiþ and clensiþ, somme defendith, and somme bereþ aboute. 
þe firste makeþ redy, as þe lymes of wittis serueþ to þe brayn, 
herte, longes, lyuere, and stomak, and to oþur suche. þe secounde 
beriþ forþ, as þe synewis takeþ þe spirit of felynge of þe brayn, 
and bereþ forþ to alle þe membris to make meuynge and felinge. 
Also þe arteries serueþ þe herte; and veines serueþ þe lyuer. For þe 
arteries takeþ þe spirit of þe herte, and beriþ forþ to make þe puls; 
and þe veynes takeþ blood of þe lyuour to norische and to fede þe 
body. þe þridde beþ pur[{g{]ynge and clensinge, and puttiþ of 
superfluitees and þingis þat greueþ, as þe hooles of þe nose in þe 
heed, and þe weye be þe whiche þe herte sendiþ out superfluyte of 
|P_165 
smook to þe longes þat it be iput al out. Also þe caase of þe galle 
and þe splene clensiþ and purgiþ þe lyuour of superfluites of 
colera and melencolia, as þe reynes clensiþ of wattry materes. þe 
ferþe defendiþ, as þe tweyen skynnes in þe skulle defendiþ þe 
brayne from gref and hurtinge. And phisicians clepiþ þise tweyne 
skynnes þe harde modir and þe mylde modir. Also þe bones of þe 
brest deffendiþ þe herte and þe ouerparties of þe arme; and þe 
tendirnes of þe ribbis deffendiþ þe lyuour. 
 
Among þe spiritual membres þe herte is chief; for he is principal 
welle of a best and foundement of kinde hete. þe longus, þe [\f. 37va\] 
skynnes, þe [{armes and þe{] arteries helpiþ þem by meuynge and 
drawynge aier to kele þe hete from þe herte, þe smale skynnes 
of þe herte and of þe mydref, and oþur suche. Of membres 
of kynde and of fedinge, þe lyuour is chief. þerinne is digestioun 
imade of blood, by þe whiche al þe body is ifedde. To þe seruyce 
of þe lyuour þe membris [{þat{] beþ ny3e þerto beþ i-ordeyned. 
 
Herof it foleweþ þat somme membres [{beþ{] principal and rootes 
and foundementes; and som beþ þe membres of office þat fongiþ 
of þe forseid membres þe influens and worchinge of vertue, and 
kepiþ þe beest, and serueþ eueryche oþir. And somme beþ iliche, 
þat Constantyn clepiþ omiomerata, þat is 'symple and of one kynde 
wiþ þe parties þerof', as to oure knoweinge. For eueryche par[{t{]ye 
of fatnes is fatnes, and so of oþir. þanne gedre þou hereof þat membres 
of kynde i-ordeined to craft makeþ þe souled body parfite, and 
takeþ of þe soule þe influens of vertue. Also som beþ i-ioyned 
togidres in a wondirful proporcioun þat hatte armonica; for þe 
more beþ icouplid to þe lesse, and þe lesse to þe more [{wiþ þe{] 
senewis and oþir bendes. Also þise membres serueþ iche oþir, and 
comuneþ here werkes and vertues and here worchinges; for þe 
ouer 3eueþ influens and gouernaunce to þe neþire; and þe neþire 
holdeþ vp þe ouere; þe myddel and mene coupleþ and oneþ þe 
ouere and þe neþere in worchinge. þe ei3en ri3tliche[{þ{] and reuleþ 
þe [{n{]eþere membres; þe feet and þe þi3es holdiþ and beriþ vp þe 
|P_166 
wi3te of oþir membres; þe hondes and armes helpiþ and defendeþ 
boþe þe ouere and þe neþere. 
 
Also as longe as membres beþ ireuled be þe soule, þey beþ 
profitable and hool to parfite worchinge and perfeccioun of þe 
body. But if he lesiþ þe gouernaunce of spirites, þey beþ greuous 
to oþir del of þe body. Also þe membres of pure and clene complexioun 
ben more able to be obedient to þe worchinge of þe 
spirit. þerfore libro 16=o= Aristotel seiþ þat þe heed haþ litil [{fleissche 
and litil{] fatnes to haue þe bettir witte and vndirstondinge. And 
þat in cas is for þe spirit in þe synewis of felinge is myche ilette in 
his passinge by hardnes and greetnes of fleissche. 
 
þe membres beþ so isette togedres þat, for þe byndinge and 
knettinge togedres, eueryche haþ compaciens of oþir. þerfore þe 
membre lesse igreued haþ compaciens of þe membre þat is more 
igreued. [\f. 37vb\] And þerfore if on membre is ihurt, þe humours 
of þe oþir membres renneþ and comeþ to þe sore place. So it is 
iseide in amphorismorum: a greet soore and an ache swagiþ þe sore 
ache in anoþir membre, and binymmeþ moche del of þe ache þerof: 
as it fareþ in hem þat haþ þe frenesye, in þe whiche if þe þighes 
and þe armes beþ harde iwronge, þe hedeache wiþdrawiþ. For þe 
spiritis and þe humours renneþ and comeþ to þe membre þat is 
harde iwronge, and so þe hed is i-esed. Also þe sotillicher þe 
membres beþ of substaunce and of composicioun, þe soore[{r{] akeþ 
and feliþ þe sonnere þe grief of hurtinge, as it fareþ in þe ei3e þat 
is more igreued wiþ a litil poudir þan þe hoond oþir þe foot wiþ 
a grete wounde, and þat is for þe nobilte of þe ei3e. For þe spirit 
of felinge hat more maistrie in þe ei3e þan in þe oþir. þerfore a litil 
hurtinge in þe ioyntis of membris in þe senewis of felinge is most 
greuous, for by let of suche membres þe vertu of felinge and 
meuynge is principalliche and most hastiliche ilet; and þe armonye, 
acoord, and oneinge of al þe body is dissolued and todeled. 
 
Also by errour of kinde in gendringe of membris somtyme 
[{happiþ{] superfluites of membres þat beþ to many and wondirlich 
ischape, as it is iseide libro animalium 17=o=: somtyme and ofte 
a beest is iseye with on body and many hedes, as a serpent was iseye 
with tweye hedis; and þat is no wondir but for it is seldene iseye. 
|P_167 
Also somtyme an ey haþ tweye 3olkes þat beþ distigned atweye by 
one webbe and calle; and þat happiþ for comynge togedre of twey 
sedes þat drawiþ eiþir to oþir in diuers tymes no3t longe atwinne. 
He seiþ also þat it happiþ ofte þat of suche an ey comeþ a membre 
wondirliche ischape, as a chicke with one body and one hede and 
foure feet and iiii. wynges, as is iseye. And as Aristotel seiþ þere, 
þis wondirful errour happiþ moost in scheepe and in geete and 
in bestes of many broodes. And þerfore he seiþ þat in olde tyme 
a goot bucke was iseye with hornes in þe þighes. þis wondir 
schapinge and superfluites in membres falliþ generallich of þe 
superfluyte of matire and defaute of þe vertue informatiue. þerfore, 
he seiþ in þe same book, we schal trowe þat þis wondirliche schap 
in membres comeþ of þe mater whanne þe vertu of worchinge is 
strong and þe matere [{oþir minished{] oþir by occasioun to litil. 
þanne it happiþ þat many membres beþ iseye, and in alle is defaute 
[\f. 38ra\] and lacke; for þe vertue for defaute of kynde oþir of 
matere my3te not at þe fulle worche, as he fondid. So seiþ he. 
 
þe vertu of worchinge in case worchiþ noþing parfitliche or at 
þe fulle. Augustinus de civitate dei libro 16=o= capitulo 8=o=, Austin 
spekeþ of men þat hatte cenocephales, and beþ wondirliche ischape 
and han houndes hedes and berkinge in stede of voyce. And he 
spekeþ of oþir withoute nolle and necke and with ei3en in þe 
schuldres. Also he seiþ þat in his tyme was a childe ibore þat was 
tweyne in þe ouerp[{ar{]tye, and on in þe neþere partye; for he 
hadde tweye hedes and tweye brestes and foure hondes and one 
wombe and tweye feet. And many suche þinges Austyn rehersiþ, 
and in alle suche is assigned errour of kynde. 
 
Also among þe membres is gret diuersite in dignite and order; 
for somme 3eueþ of hymself and takeþ nou3t of oþir: as þe herte 
takeþ no3t of oþir, as Aristotel seiþ. Neuerþeles þe herte 3eueþ 
to oþir lif and meuynge. And somme 3eueþ and takeþ, as þe lyuour 
and brayne takeþ strengþe of þe herte, and be principalles of 
vertues; for þey 3eueþ vertues to oþir membres. And somme 
membres neyþir 3eueþ ne takeþ, and stondiþ in here oune vertue 
by þe menynge of phisiciens, as þe membres of on kynde iliche 
with here owne partyse. And somme membres takeþ and 3eueþ 
not, as þe membres þat beþ instrumentis and takeþ of þe brayn 
|P_168 
þe vertue of feling and of meuynge and somtyme of aieþir. For þe 
vertue þat he takeþ he sendiþ no3t furþer; for þe y3e [{may not 
3eue þe vertu of seynge þat he fongiþ of þe brayne{] to þe hondes 
nor to þe feet nor to oþir membres; nor þe ere may 3eue þe vertu 
of heringe to oþir membres, and so of oþir. And neuerþeles þise 
membres beþ most nedeful to þe body; for by here proper office 
he reuleþ þise oþir membres of þe body, but it be in som cas ilette 
in here worchinge, as ihurt oþir corrupt. 
 
It is propur to alle þe membres of office to putte hemsilf to 
perile for þe principal membres, as somtyme þe hond puttiþ itself 
kindeliche wiþouten auisement for þe defens of þe heed. Also a 
membre þat is in good hele helpeþ þe membre þat is sike and sore, 
and drawiþ þe matere of þe euel to itself, and helpiþ þe membre 
þat is sike and sore. And so often þe hole membre is ihurt for þe 
membre þat was sike. If a membre is irooted oþir deed it is greuous 
to itself and to al þe body; and þerfore is none oþir remedye but 
kutte it of þat he destroye not and corrumpe al þe body. And be 
þis inou3 of þe membres in [\f. 38rb\] general at þis tyme.
