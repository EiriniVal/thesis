|P 
[}Here begynneth a lytyll treatyse schortely 
compyled and called ars moriendi / that is 
to saye the craft for to deye for the helthe of 
mannes sowle.}] 
WHan ony of lyklyhode shal deye / thenne 
is moste necessarye to haue a specyall 
frende / the whiche wyll hertly helpe and praye 
for hym & therwyth counseyll the syke for the 
wele of his sowle / & more ouer to see that alle 
other so do aboute hym / or ellys quyckly for to 
make hem departe. Thenne is to be remembred 
the grete benefeytes of god done for hym 
vnto that tyme / and specyally of þ=e= passyon of 
our lorde / and thenne is to be rede somme story 
of sayntes or the vij psalmes wyth þ=e= letanye 
or our lady psalter in parte or hole wyth other 
And euer the ymage of the crucyfyxe is to be 
hadde in his syght wyth other. And holy water 
is oftymes to be cast vpon and about hym 
for auoydyng of euyll spirytes þ=e= whiche then~e 
be full redy to take theyr auauntage of the 
sowle yf they may. And thenne and euer 
make hym crye for mercy and grace & for the 
helpe of our blessyd Lady & of other sayntes in 
whome afore he hadde a synguler trust & loue 
and thereupon to make his prayers yf he may. 
Whan deth cometh or ony greuous pangys / 
or other grete sykenes / thenne prayer or deuocion 
asswageth / wherfore it is wysdome for 
one to praye afore ony sykenesse come / & also 
whan one may in his sykenes yf he wyll not 
be deceyued. So he is happy & may be glad 
that suche a tyme of most nede hath a feytfull 
frende & that wyll say besyde þ=e= prayers a fore 
rehersed & cause other also to say deuoutly in remembrau~ce 
of þ=e= charyte of Jh~u cryst & of his 
passyon & for to haue þ=e= rader his mercy & helpe 
iij p~r nosters & iij auees with a credo And therwith 
to exhorte him by a prest or for nede by an 
other in the maner as it foloweth. 
 
BRoder or syster remembre wel that god 
seyth by his prophete & eua~gelyst. Blyssed 
be tho that deye & departe in our lorde / that 
is to say from the worlde and his pleasurys 
and deye in the trewe fayth of the chyrche and 
repentaunce for hyr synnes. Syr ye haue 
|P 
grete cause to be glad for to departe from this 
wretchyd worlde and fall of alle mysery / and 
thynke that ye nedes must departe / and desyre 
hertely to be wyth Jhesu cryst your maker redemer / 
& lord god / for he shal gyue to you now 
your enherytau~ce that he dyde bye for you with 
his precyous passyon & blood / wherfore this 
tyme of your departyng shall be better to you 
than the tyme of your byrthe / for now all sykenesse 
sorow and trouble shall departe now 
from you for euer. Therfore be not agreuyd 
wyth youre sykenesse and take it not wyth 
grutchyng but take it rather by all gladnesse 
See at all tymes that ye be stable in your 
faythe and byleue and say your Credo yf that 
ye may or ellys desyre a nother hertely to doo it 
for you here afore vs openly. And arme you 
euer wyth the sygne of þ=e= crosse + as a crysten 
man for your defence ageynst youre ghoostly 
enemyes / in þ=e= whiche doyng / god wyll be gretly 
pleased & the rather take you for one of his 
folke by proteccyon and grace & as his chylde 
of saluacyon. Haue euer a good & trew byleue / 
& no thyng may be Impossyble vnto you 
And euer beware that ye fall not in dyspeyre 
for that gretly wolde dysplease god / & can not 
be remedyed. And remembre þ=t= synnes done afore 
tyme shall neuer hurt you as to dampnacyon / 
yf they please you not now & that ye be 
sory for hem. Saynt Jerome seyth / yf one 
sholde take his sekenesse or his deth with grutchyng / 
it is a token that he loueth not god suffycyently / 
alle is ryghtwyse that we suffre. 
Desyre with saynt austyn of our lorde here 
to be cutte wyth trybulacyon & to be brenned 
wyth sykenes & sorowe / soo þ=t= ye may be saued 
herafter for euer. Now meke your self & be 
sory that ye haue ben so vnkynde to please & to 
kepe his co~maundementes & presume not as 
of your self ony goodnesse / & say wyth all mekenesse 
thus. Good lord Jhesu cryst I knowleche 
that I haue synned greuously / & by thy grace 
I wyll gladly amende me yf I shold lyue / haue 
mercy now of me for thy bytter passyon. 
Than aske hym thyse questyons folowynge 
a fore his deth. 
 
BE ye glad that ye shal deye in cristen byleue. 
Lete hym answere / ye / knowe ye þ=t= 
|P 
ye haue not so well lyued as ye shold / ye / haue 
ye wyll to amende yf that ye sholde lyue / ye / byleue

borne of blessyd marye / ye / Byleue ye also that 
Jhesu cryst deyed vpon þ=e= crosse to bye mannes

therefore / ye / Byleue ye þ=t= ye may not be saued 
but by his passyon & deth / ye / As long as 
þ=e= soule is in your body thanke god for his deth 
& haue a sure trust by it & his passyon to be saued. 
And counseyll hym to say yf þ=t= he may

PPut crystys passyon betwyx me & myne 
euyll werkys / & betwyx me & his wrathe 
Now lorde god be mercyfull to me a synner.

The famose doctour Johan gerson Chau~celler

vnto hym thyes iij vertues folowyng / soo 
that they be sayde & done wyth all the herte deuoutly. 
The fyrst is that thou shalt say Blessed 
lord I knowleche that I haue synned greuously 
ageynst thy goodnesse thus and thus

in what place þ=t= euer he be / he may be sure that 
he is in the state of grace and saluacyon and 
that he shall haue euerlastyng lyf though all 
he had done all the synnes of the world. And 
yf he decessyd wythout ony other confessyon for 
lack of a preest as slepyng or sodeyne deth / he 
sholde be saue suffryng a fore harde payne in
