[^BENVENUTUS GRASSUS^] 
 
|P_49 
[\p. 1\] A grete phylosopher and a profunde phycycyane clepid 
Benuonucius Grapheus, after the sentence of þe olde auctors 
of phelozophie and of phisyk whiche he had radde, and 
after hys propre experyence the wych he had by long contynuance 
of his owne practik yn dyuerse parties of the world, 
boyth yn hote regyons and colde, by influence and help of 
goddys grace, compilyd and made a boke of the sekenes of eyon 
and of her curys: and entitled thys boke and clepid it Deus 
oculorum. 
 
Of the which boke yn the fyrst chapitre he declarith what an 
eye ys and the makyng þerof [\p. 2\] after [{the opinion of the 
auntient phisitions{] and also after his own seying: a eye is a 
rounde holow thyng, herde os the balle of the foote, 
ful of clere water, set in the well of the hede 
to minystre lyght to the body by influence of the vysyble spyrit 
sent from the fantastical celle by a synew clepid neruus obticus, 
with the helpe of a gretter light mynystryde from withoute. And 
conueniently ys the place where the eye is sett clepid the well of 
the hed, for the habundance of watery humors and teris, the 
whych often yssu þer bycause sumtyme of sorow and 
heuynes of herte, sumtyme of ioye and gladnes, and sumtyme 
for habundance [\p. 3\] of superfluytees of humors causid of cold. 
And forasmuche as euery naturall man hath such ij wellis, 
|P_50 
nature hath sett in euery hed ij eyon. Thus þan bryefly [{is{] 
shewid by this auctor what euery eye is. 
 
Consequently he shewyth how an ey is made. Ffirst he rehersyth 
the opynyon of a gret leche clepid Johannicius and after he 
puttyth hys owne opinyon. Johannicius in his Ysagogys seyth 
that an ey hath vij tunycles, or vij cootis, iiij colors, and iij 
humors. The first tunicle or cote ys clepid rectina, the secunde 
secundina, the thirde scliros, the iiijth aranea, the vth vuea, the 
vjth cornea, the [\p. 4\] vijth and the last coniunctiua. The first 
coler is niger, that is blak; the ijde is subalbidus, whytyshe; the 
iijde is varius, that is dyuerse in color; the iiijth is blancus, 
yolow. The first humour is callid uitrius, glassy or like glas; 
th[{e{] ijde ys cristallinus, like cristal; the iijde is albigenius, 
like the white of an egge. Thus sayth Johannicius. 
But Benuonucius varieth from hym in cotys and yn colours, 
ffor as he seyth an ey hath but ij tonycles or cotys, as he hath 
proued by hys anothomie of eyon; þat ys to sey by [{incytion{] 
or kuttyng of a dede body. The fyrst cote he callyth "saluatricem," 
that is a sauyour, for it [\p. 5\] sauyth and kepyth the 
humors. [{[\f. 2\] Yif the first happeth to be broke or thorowe anythinge 
ys perforate, and for that hole may not holde the humors of the ey3en, 
wareþorwe it seuwith that all the substaunce of the ey3en is wasted and the 
ey3e withe his humors ys consumed. The tonicle of the ei3e ys that clere 
sercle the which to many it apperethe blak, to other appereth variaunce; and 
by the myddell of the ei3e ther is an hole, the which hole is said "pupilla," 
anglice the "appell of the ey3e," bi the whiche the visible spirite comyng 
by þe holwe nerffe, hathe his outegoyng, and taketh lyght of a [\f. 2v\] grete 
clerte.{] The secunde tonycle or cote he callyth "discoloratam," 
þat ys discolurde or of no colour. Ffor as he sayth, in the ey of 
hymselfe ys propurly no colour, but dyuersytees of colurs þat 
|P_51 
apperen yn the ey. For when the cristallyne humor ys nygh 
the tonycle of the ey, than the ey semyth of oon colour. And 
whan yt ys in the myddys, þan it semyth of another colour. And 
when yt ys depe wythyn, þan it semyth of the iijde colour. 
Wherof he concludyth þat the ey of ytselfe ys discolurd and hath 
no colurn propurly. 
 
Tho men þat haue the humors lowe set and wythyn her eyon 
semen blake and þei see best [\p. 6\] for a tyme, but when þei cum 
abowt xxxti wynter or more þan here syght begynnyth to peyre. 
Thei also þat haue the humers set aboute the middys of the 
eyon, þei communly se wele yong and olde; and the colour of 
the eyon ys meueable blak that we call grey. But often yt ys seyn 
þat in þis maner of eyon obtalmie, þat is derknes of sy3t, and 
panniclus, that is smale webbys, and oþer dyuerse dyseasis, 
whych shal[{l{] he declaryd hereafter, thei grow rather þan yn 
oþer maner of eyen colourid. 
 
But þei þat haue humours situat or set nygh besyde the 
tonnycles haue eyen varied of diuers colours, and hangyn mych 
yn whitnesse and [\p. 7\] hir syght is not right goode neþer yn 
yowgth nor age. Ffor yn þo maner of eyon haue bendyng 
humors of teris more þan yn oþer; ffor when the uisible spirite 
descendyng down by the holow synews fynde aboute the tonycle 
fresche habundance and plente of corupte humors, þei ben the 
sunner disgregat and dyssolued from the humors. Also ys the 
sight the feblere yn them þan yn þo that haue þer eyon meueablye 
blake. 
 
In tho propurly þat haue grey eyon the sy3t duryth better þen 
yn other, ffor the cristallyne beyng resydent yn the middys 
makyth the visual spiritys to [\p. 8\] abyde þere; wherby the 
glassy humore and the tonycle of the ey ys kept yn, þat it may 
not redely be disgregat and disparbolyd. 
 
But yn þem that haue þer humurs depe downe, the whych 
|P_52 
causyth the ey to seme blak, as I sayd before, better þan oþer 
seyn for the depth of the cristallyne humor. Fro the spirite of 
sy3t, commyng from the synew obtik, fyndyth the large space 
and fulfillyth all the concauyte of holownesse of the ey ere yt 
passe from the glassy humor and the tonycle. But os ys sayd it 
dureth not in many to age, for comunly in thyes maner of eyen 
ar oftener gendred [\p. 9\] cateract and fumous sy3t than yn oþer. 
And as for the humors thys auctor and [{Johannicius{] 
accorde yn. [{[\f. 3v\] Ther ben thre humours of the whiche the first is 
said albugineus for it is lyche the white of the naye of a henne. The secunde 
is cleped humour cristallyn for it is liche to the cristall. The thirde humour, 
humour vitreus, humour glasy, for it is liche white glasse. Wherfore it is to 
vndyrstonde that ther ys a maner holwenes in the ouer partie of optici 
nerffe, and that holwenes is full of water yelwisshe and departed in thre 
partis and in thre diuisiouns: in kynde, in name, [{not{] in figure, and 
in felynge. Wherfor the first spice in kynde of felynge ys liche the white of 
an aye. And the second as it were a fresshe gumme. The third hathe in 
felynge as it were swynes larde whan it is soden. And alle ben in substaunce 
and ben nought departed and ben in one figure, saue they haue a 
distinccion in the felyng and in name. Wherefor the first is that Johannicius 
albuginem, the secunde cristallyne, the third vitreus. 
 
Of the complexions of humoures and of the substaunce [\f. 4\] of whom 
they ben nourshed. Therfor y saye that the complexioun of the first albuginosi 
humour is colde and moyste. The 2e forsothe is colde and drie, id est 
cristallyn. The thirde is colde and drie, that is vitreus. But netheles it 
hathe lesse of coldenes than of drinesse; for his coldenesse is temperate into 
hete of blode, the whiche is in the ey3eleddes, þe whiche is more ny3 than 
any othir humour. And sithen that humour vitreus and cristallynus ben 
nourshed of the gummosite of the neruis, and the humour albugenosus is 
nourshed of the viscosite of the brayne.{] 
 
Now after he hath tau3t what an eye is and how it ys mayd 
|P_53 
and of the colour and of the humors of eyon, he consequently 
bygynneth to trete of the infirmytees of an ey and after of the 
curys. And fyrst he begynnyth to trete of cateract. 
 
And after hys doctrine a cateracte is nou3t ellys but a 
corupt water or a water congyeld lyke a crude, gendred of 
humors of the ey, dystemperd betwyx the tonycle, and set 
before the [\p. 10\] ly3t of the eye and the crystallyne humor. And 
of this maner of cateract þer be vij maner of dyuers spices, 
wherof iiij be curable and iij uncurable. And fyrst he tretyth of 
the iiij curable. 
 
He seyth þat the fyrst of þe curable cateractys ys lyke ryght 
bri3t whyte chalke or alabastre vele polyshyd and is causyd of a 
stroke yn the ey wyth a styk or wyth a stone or any oþer outwarde 
vyolence. The secunde cateractte curable ys sumwhat 
white and lykenyd much to a celestyal color, and this procedyth 
from the stomake and is comunly causyd of wykkyd [\p. 11\] 
metis, wherof a groos fumosytee resoluyd ascendyth vp ynto the 
brayn and from thens fallyth downe into the eyon. The thyrde 
cateractte curable ys also whytyshe but it turnyth into the color 
of ashes and is comunly gendrid of the payn of the hede, as the 
mygrym and such other, and is causid of gret sorowe sumtyme 
and of grete heuynes cawsyng grette wepyng, and sumtyme of 
much colde and much watche and such oþer. And the iiijth spice 
of cateracct curable ys of sytrynne color and it ys comunly 
gendryd of exces meete and drynk yndegest, and also of gret 
labour and sumtyme humurs [\p. 14\] malencoly. 
 
Thyes iiij spices ben curable, but neuer tyl þei ben grown and 
confermed with his signe; and the tokyn of hyr complexion or 
confermyng is when the pacyent seyth ry3th nowght but yf it be 
bry3tnes of the sunne by day or the mone by ny3t or a lanterne. 
And many lewde leches not knowyng the causes nor propertes 
|P_54 
of thyes maner of cateracties weyn to cure þem with purgacions, 
powders, and plastrys, but thei be disceyuyd. [{[\f. 5\] Forwhy 
thoo cataractes ben vndyr the tonicles of the ey3en and ben engendred of 
humours of the ey3en, that is the humour albuginoys. Fforwhy thorugh 
accacioun of the forsaid causes, the humour albuginoys ys dissoluid in 
partye and hit rotith; and that roted is as it were water congelid and 
crudded. And it is putten afore the lyght and afore the ey3e appill, bitwene 
the tonicle and the cristallyne humour; the which the Sarazyns and the 
Arabies clepen hit "amesarca," that is in Latyn "aqua putrefacta," in 
Englisshe "water yroted" in the ey3e. Of the whiche it sheweth openly that 
they mowen nought be holpon withe poudres neither with other medecyns 
yputte in the ey3e, sithen the mater and all the humours of the ey3en withyn 
the tonicles ben conteyned.{] For thyes maner of diseasys may not 
be curid oonly by medycyns, neyther ynward or outwarde nor 
princypally, but by thys craft that ys callyd "ars acuaria," [\p. 15\] 
that ys to saye the craft of nedyl. In whych craft whoso wyll 
procede artyfycyally he must begyn thus: 
 
Ffyrst he must porge his brayn with pelett callyd pillule 
Iherosolimitane, wherof thus is the makyng: Take turbite, 
aloes, epatica - of euerych an ownce; macys, quibybus, mastic, 
and dylle - of eche of þem a dram. And beete þem into pouder 
and confecte þem with the jows of rose, and make þerof pelatis. 
 
And when he hath youen the pacyent purgacioun, on the day 
next foloyng abowt ix of the clok whyle he is fastyng do hym 
sitte ouerthwart [{a forme{] , rydyng-wyse; and sytte you also 
on the stoke yn lyk wyse face to face. And do the pacyent [\p. 16\] 
to holde the hole eye cloos with hys oon hande, and charge hym 
that he syt stydfastly styl and styre not. And þen blysse the and 
begyn thy craft in the name of Ihesu Cryste. 
 
And with thy lyft hand lyft vp hys oon eylyd, and with þin 
oþer hande put yn thy nedyl made þerfore on the forþer syde 
from the nose. And softly thyrl the tonycle saluatrice, and alwey 
|P_55 
wryth thy fyngers too and fro tyll þou touche wyth the poynt the 
corupte water, the whych ys the cateracte. And then begyn to 
remeue downward from aboue wyth the poynte the sayd corrupte 
water fro beforne the sy3th, and dryue yt down beneth 
[\p. 17\] and þere kepe it styl with the poynt of the nedyl as long as 
þou mayst say iij or iiij tymes "pater noster." 
 
Than remeue esely the nedyl therfro. And it hape to ryse vp 
ayen, bryng it down ageyne to the corner of the ey to the erewarde. 
But here beware þat after tyme the nedyl hath towchyd 
the cateract þou schalt no more wrythe thy fyngers to and fro tyl 
þat it be set yn hys place as it ys seyd before. And þan softlye 
drawe out thy nedyl as þou put it yn, alway thyrllyng thy 
fingurs to and fro tyl yt be all owte. 
 
And anon make a plaster of coton or of flaxe herdis [\p. 18\] 
with the whyte of an egg and ley it on the sore eye. And do 
hym lye down in hys bed wyde opon ix days. After charge hym 
that he ster not hys eye all that tyme. And thryys yn the day and 
tryys yn the nyght, remeue the playster. And he to lye yn a 
derke house. And for hys dyet the ix days, lete hym ete rere 
eggis wyth breed. And yf he be yong and strong, lete hym 
drynk water; and yf he be yn age, lete hym drynk wyne medlyd 
water. Som byd hym ete fresch flesche and hennys, but we 
forbedde yt, for þei be noryshyng of mych blode – ther myght 
be gendryd yn the eyon that [\p. 19\] my3te be contrary to oure 
cure. 
 
When the ix days ar past, make on the eye a tokyne of the 
crosse and let hym ryse vp and wasche wele hys face and hys 
eyon wyth fayr colde water. And after that doo hys occupacion 
that he hath to doon. And in thys wyse be curyd all the cateractis 
curable, and who that wyll cure hem oþerwyse shall dyseyue 
þemselfe, ignorant of the true craft of curyng. 
 
And thys crafte aforesayde ys callyd the nedyll crafte, for it ys 
excercysed and don with the nedyll. But alway beware that the 
nedyll be of golde or of syluer or of clene [\p. 20\] Spanesh laten, 
|P_56 
and yn no wyse of yren nor of stele. And þat ys for the hardnesse 
þat dyssoluyth suche as yt towchyth. Another cause ys for yf the 
cateract be harde yn drawyng down therof, the poynt my3te 
ly3tely breke, for yron and stele arne frayle and brytyll, and so 
the poynt abydyng yn the eye my3te cause [{a{] consumpcion 
of the eye thorugth habundance of terys and gretnese of payne. 
[{[\f. 6v\] The third forsoth the nedill of yren more greuethe and more 
wey3th, and the pacient felithe his hardenes more than it were of siluer or of 
golde. But of siluer or of golde boþe ben full good for her clennes and her 
softenes, but golde moste clarifiethe for his dominium for it is moste in his 
propriete.{] 
 
Thys spyce of cateract is, as the aucter seyth, easely and sone 
cured. But yit þei þat ben cured seen not ryght wele, forasmuch 
as the [\p. 21\] humor yn the eye ys yn party dysgregat and 
dyssoluyd by the stroke and be bruser therof, whych stroke was 
cause of the cateract. 
 
The secunde spyce of cateract curable, yf it be welle cured 
with the nedyl as it is seyd before, the ly3te turneth ayen to hys 
fyrst brygh[{t{]nes, for by purenes of the humurs whych be 
not dyssolued and also for habundance of the vysible spyrit yn 
the eye. And therfore tho þat be cured of thyes maner of cateract 
see better 
after then those that be cured of the other cataracte caused of a 
strook or outward blowe. 
 
The thyrde spyce of cateract curable after that yt ys cured 
with the nedyl and the syght recouered, yf it dure not long yn 
[\p. 22\] that astate [{then let{] it be holpen with oþer medicynes, 
as with oure electuarie that we call diolibanum Salernitanum 
and wyth good dyet as yt schal be tolde after. The 
makyng of oure diolibanum ys thys: 
|P_57 
Take olibanum ij vncys; clouys, notemygys, notys of Indie, 
saferon, of eche lyke - that ys of ycche a dram and an halfe; of 
good castor a dram. Bete all thyes to powder and sars þem and 
confete hem togedder wyth claryfyed hony, and make electuarye. 
And of thys lete the pacyent resceyue yn the mornyng 
fastyng the quantite of a good chasteyn or of a walnot, and 
[\p. 23\] at eue to bed-ward as much. And for hys dyet [{let him{] 
vsyn dygestyble metys hote and moyst, whych engender good 
blode. And let hym beware of contrarius metys, and for cowes 
fleshe, ghetys fleshe, and eelys, and such oþer, and specyally of 
rawe onyons, for they be specyally contrarius, as I have prouyd 
be experyence. Ffor many haue come too me with cateractys 
not fully confermede: I made hem, quod he, to ete rawe onyons 
to conferme with the cateract, and they were sone spede. Wherfore, 
rawe onyons be noyows to the sy3te. And yn wynter lett 
nat the pacyent drynk hoote wynes [\p. 24\] yn whych be put 
sawge and rewe. And abstene he from commenyng of women, 
nor let nat hym com in no bath nor stew. And yff he wyll 
algattis bath hym, lete hym enter to a stewe or fat wyth the 
water of the decoccion of camamyl or oþer swete smellyng 
herbys, but lett hym kepe hys hede without the wessyl þat the 
fume cum not ynto hys eyon, for þat were noyous. The forsayd 
electuarye of diolibanum Salernitanum ys also good, as he 
seyth, to avoyde terys and to dystroye þem. And so yt ys also for 
al maner payne of the mygryme that ys caused of flume. 
 
The iiijth spyce of [\p. 25\] cateract curable, þat ys of colour 
citryne, ys herder þan any of the oþer and also yt ys rownd. 
Wherfore yt may not be leyd ryght downe yn the ey, for yt wyl 
not abyde þere for the rowndnesse and hardnes þereof. And 
þerefore yt must be leyd yn the corner of the ey to the erewarde, 
and þere be kepte with the nedyll a good whyle as yt ys 
beforeseyd. 
 
|P_58 
But hyer fynyally I wyl 3e knowe, 3e þat wyll be practyfe yn 
the acurye crafte, þat noon of þies iiij curable cateractes yt 
nedyth to doon from clene metys abstynence, as I haue prouyd 
by experyence, [\p. 26\] saue oonly yn the thyrde spyce, where 
neuerthelesse yt behouyth alwey to haue confortatiuus and neutrytyuus 
of the vysible spiryt yn the eyon. 
 
The iij cateractes vncurable be thyes: The fyrst lechys of 
Salerne call guttam serenam, and thys ys the sygne of knowyng: 
The pyupyl of the ey, þat ys place yn the myddys of the eye 
where ys the resydence of the sy3te, ys blake and clere as towe yt 
hade no spotte, and the ey ys meuyng alwey with the lyddys 
tremelyng as tow þei were ful of quyksyluer. And thys cateract 
[\p. 27\] ys causyd of a corrupcion of the moders wombe. And 
þerfore tho comunly that haue thys cateracte byth blynde borne, 
off whom, quod he, I haue assayd with dyuerse medycyns to 
cure many, but yt wolde neuer be: I cowd neuer heer þat ony 
such was cured. But nat forþan I perceuyd wele þat of thies 
maner cateractys were dyuersytee, ffor sum of them my3te see 
the bry3tnes of the son and went be the way wyth opon ey as 
thow þei had perfy3tly seyn. And sum my3te see the stature of a 
man and of a best or of another thyng and not els. And [\p. 28\] 
sum had thys lytle parte of ly3te to her lyues ende, and of sum yt 
vanyshyd avaye and þei hade no more sy3te as towe þei neuer 
had none. [{[\f. 7v\] Wherefore yif me yeue all the golde of the worlde 
and all the leches thorugh trauailled ther, none of hem with no medecyn 
may helpe but oure lorde Jhesu Crist thorow his vertue.{] Wherfor I 
wyll that ye knowe all thyes maner of cateractes ben vncurable, 
lesse þan God cure þem, ffor the neruys obtyk be so opylate, 
that ys such maner of synewes ben so stoppyd and mortifyed, 
þat no medycyn may helpe yt. And þerfor thyes cateractys we 
clepyn guttam serenam, ffor yt ys gendyrde of a corrupcion 
commyng downe from the brayn yn the maner of a drope of 
water whych corruptyth and dyssoluyth [\p. 29\] all the humurs of 
the ey; that fro thens foreward the concaue or the holow synewys 
|P_59 
be so stoppyd and ouerlayd that the vysyble spiryte may 
no more passe down by them. 
 
The secunde maner of cateractys vncurable ys the whych 
apperyth withyn the ey of grene color, lyke water stondyng yn 
watry placys not much meuyd nor renewed. [{[\f. 8\] Wherfor 
kno[{w{] well that this maner of cataractes comethe into the ey3en litell 
and lytell, but it comethe sodenly so fro that houre forward he seithe no 
more.{] And thys cateracte ys the worst of all oþer and ys gendred 
and causyde of ouermych coldnes of the brayn, of gret 
betyng yn the hede, fer fastyng, and such other. 
 
The thyrde vncurable cateracte ys when the pupil [\p. 30\] ys 
dylated and sprede abroode so fer that no cerkyl may be seyn 
withyn the tonycle. [{But 
all the naterall lyght after that it is so spredde abrode that none helpe may 
helpe hem that longethe to the medecyne.{] [{And whoso laboreth to 
cuer any of these 3 cataractes doth losse his labor.{] 
 
Now after the doctryne and knowlege of cateractes and the 
nombre of them, and whych be curable and whych nat, and the 
cures of the curable and the knowlege of the causes of 
vncurable – now I wyll, quod he, speke of oþer sekenes causyd 
and occasyonyd of the iiij humors, as blode, flewme, color, and 
malyncolye. But first of the sekenes causyd of blode, for oftentymes 
[\p. 31\] for multitude of blode þer growyth a rednes yn the 
ey with a grete brynnyng, and after yt tornyth into grete ycche. 
And thys dysease makyth the here of the eylyddys to fall awey, 
and of many yt semyth of non here. And yf thys sekenes be nat 
curyd in a yere, yt wyll make the eyelyddys to turne vp and 
make the pacyent bleryed. Wherfor ere yt cum to the poynt, yt 
may be curyd, quod he, with my colery that ys clepyd colerium 
Iherosolimitanum that ys mayd yn thyse wyse: 
 
Take tutie of Alexandrye an vnce and beyt to smale powder, 
|P_60 
and temper yt with ij pounds [\p. 32\] of whyte wyne, þat ys a 
quarte. And put yt yn a new erthyn pote, and put þerto an vnce 
of dry roses and boyl yt wyth a sokyng fyre tyl the wyne be half 
wasted. Then clense yt through a lynnyn cloyth and kepe yt 
yn a vyall of glas. And morn and yeuen put yt ynto hys eyon. 
And yf yt be takyn betymes, the pacyent schal be curyd withyn 
a weke or ij at moost. And wyth thys, quod he, I haue holpyn 
manny. 
 
Neuerthelesse, or the practyser begyn, lete hym make the 
pacyent, yf he be yong, to blede on the veyne yn the myddys of 
the [\p. 33\] hede. Yf he be agyd, purge hys brayne wyth pullyalys 
or pelatys made ayen ycche, thus made: 
 
Take aloes, epatyk, sandalys rubeus, esule, rubarbe ana half 
an vnce; turbit, catapucie minoris, and agaryk ana a quarteron 
of an vnce; and confect hem with the jus of mugworte. And lete 
the pacyent resceyue therof after þeir strength. And truly þies 
peletys ar not good only for ycche of eyon, but also for all maner 
ycche and skabe of what humor þat euer yt be causyd. And thies 
arn clepyd pillule Benuenuci. 
 
Also ther ben other sekenes of eyon causyd and engendrede 
[\p. 34\] of blode, as obtalmies and panniculus. And thyes happyn 
to be engendred more abowte the ende of August and so 
forth to the ende of Septembre more thanne oþer tymes of the 
yere, for bycause of chaungyng of the eyre. Obtalmies comunly 
haue þer domyne or power þat tyme for bycause of dyuersytees 
of frutees þat be eten at that tyme, and by occasyon of obtalmyes 
be founde yn the eye pannycles. 
 
Than yt ys conuenyent to tell what ys obtalmye and what ys a 
pannycle. Obtalmye ys a corrupte blode gendryd of hote 
humurs, and communly yt stondyth [\p. 35\] of the whyte of the 
eye and rownde abowte the tonycles and the blaknes of the eye. 
And yt commyth with a grete furour and brynnyng and habundance 
of terys þat anoon the eyn bolne, and on such wyse þat 
from þat tyme forth the pacyent may haue no reste nor slepe, 
|P_61 
ffor euer yt semyth to hym þat hys eyn were ful of grauel or 
thornes or smoke. To thys maner of sekenes, be yt yn yong 
folkys or aged, thys ys the cure: 
 
Take a sarcacollum album and bete yt wele to pouder yn a 
brasym morter, and of pouder put the eye ful and lette hym ley 
wyde opyn tyll the powder be consumed. And yn the [\p. 36\] 
meanetyme make a plaster of flaxen herdys and wesshe þem 
welle togydder yn cold water and presse out all the water yn 
thyn honde. And then ley yt on the seke ey, the pacyent lyyng 
alwey wyde opyn. And anoon thow schalt see þat he schal 
begynne to rest and to sclepe. 
 
Thys maner of infirmyte the grete lechys of Salerne clepyd 
obtalmyam, but I, quod Benuonucius, calle yt torturam tenebrosam, 
ffor so much as it commyth with so greet a torment þat 
it makyth the eye dymme and derke. And the forseyd medycyne 
ys callyd puluerem [\p. 37\] benedictum, the blessyd powder; ffor 
with þat powder, wythoute ony oþer blode lettyng or purgacion 
or oynement, I haue holpyn many of thys maner of sekenes. 
 
Knowe 3e þat euyl curyng, euyl kepyng, vnknowyng lechys, 
folowyng errors for lak of dewe crafte with theyr impertynent 
medycynes, add yn sorow vpon sorow and peyn opon peyne, by 
occasyon wherof many a pacyent comme neuer to helth. And 
yn sum occasyon of suche contraryous medycyns, the eyon with 
all þeir concauytee apeeren wythout the lyddys, that þei be foul 
disfygurde and [\p. 38\] dyshonurde and yit þei see not. And 
when þei ar come to th[{is{] plyte, þere may no medycyne 
helpe þem, forasmuche as the eye ys dyssauerd and departed 
from hys inwarde sy3te or place and mortyfyed yn all hys substance. 
And yit sum oþer ther be þat by occasyon of obtalmie ar 
gretly troublyde yn þere eyen, fumous and often wepyng for 
evyll keepyng and for that they ete contraryous metys. But yit 
|P_62 
þei arn not vncurable. Wherfor yf ony such come to your cure, 
ffyrst pourge hys brayne with thies peletys: 
 
Take polypodie, esule, myrabolanys, cytryne, [\p. 39\] 
rubarbe ana ounce 1; masticys, cubibys, saferon, spygnarde, 
nucys Indicem, cynamon ana a drame. And þan medyll them 
with mylke and yeue to the seke after hys strength. And after 
thys purgacion, yeue hym morne and yeue of the electuarie 
dyolibanum or Salernitanum, os yt ys sayd beforn in the cure of 
the iij curable cateract. And on the morn put yn hys ey of the 
powder callyd puluis nabetys (the makyng therof and the vertu 
yt schal be tau3t hereafter yn the cure of the iij pannycles). And 
at eve put theryn of the powder callyde [\p. 40\] puluis Alexandrini, 
as it ys seyd a lytle before. And thys do tyll the pacyent be 
ful hoole, and yn meanetyme kepe hym from contraryus metys. 
 
Now after the obtalmie I wyll speke of pannyclys and her 
curys, whych be gendryde of superhabundance of blode (as 
obtalmies be in dyuerse wyse). In tyme of euyl keepyng and 
after by grete peyne fallyng yn the heede ys causyd the 
mygreym, wherthrugh the peyne descendyth ynto the templys 
and ynto the [\p. 41\] browys and makyth the veynes to bete, of 
whych peynful betyng the eyon arn trowblyd. The pannyclys 
arn gendryd yn the eyon yn iiij wyse, as thus: 
 
The fyrste pannycle apperyth yn the ey as the seyd of a 
corne clepyd in Laten milys and yn Ynglych myleseed. Thyes 
greynes or cornellys of myle growen yn the tonycle saluatrice; 
and in sum place they arn clepyd guttatici, and yn oþer places 
pedacelle, and in Naples þei ar callyd creature. The secunde 
pannycle ys that whych apperyth [\p. 42\] on the tonycle saluatryce 
lyke a spotte yn the face or lyk a frakyn or the scale of a 
fysch. The iijd apperyth on that on partye of the ey as a flake of 
snowe when yt snewyth. The iiijth ys when all the ey aperyth 
white and no blaknes aperyth neþer on the tonycle nor on the 
ly3te. 
 
The cure of the fyrst ys: put no medycyne nor withyn nor 
|P_63 
wythoute, ffor þis infirmytee may not be curyd wyth laxatyvs 
nor wyth pouders nor wyth coleryes nor wyth electuaryes nor 
wyth cauteryes, ffor all þies raþer noye þan helpe. Ffor thys 
maner [\p. 43\] of pannycle ys curyd wyth thys precious oynement: 
 
Take xl tender croppys of bremell and stampe hem as smale 
as sause; and a goode handful of rewe and powder of alabastre 
halfe a pownde; fenkyl seed poudered halfe an vnce; oyle of 
roses a pounde. All thyes encorporate togydder, put þem yn a 
new erthen pott wyth a quarte of whyte wyne, and to all thyes 
put iiij vnces of drye floures of camamyl and of wexe an vnce. 
Then boyle yt wyth easy fyre tyll all the wyne be consumed and 
wasted so ferforth that yt semeth to frye. [\p. 44\] After thys anon 
put þerto the whyte of vj eggys and alway stere tyll þei be 
yncorporate togydder; thanne streyne yt þorugh a lynnyn 
cloyth. And thys oynement ys callyd preciosum vnguentum 
alabastri, the prescyous oynement of alabaster. Wyth thys 
anoynt the temples of the pacyent and the forhede down to the 
browys, which oonly curyth thys pannycle þat aperyth as greynes 
of milie. Thys precyous oynement hath many grete vertues, 
for not oonly yt avaylyth for thys manner of pannycle þat 
apperyth as grene of milie, but also [\p. 45\] where any man fele 
any dysease yn the body, lete hym anoynte hym þereof and he 
schal fynde ease. And yf a man haue a wounde, let hym ley of 
thys onement þertoo and yt schal clense yt and close yt. Also for 
the toothake anoynte thy cheke þer ayenst, and anon yt slakyth 
the payne. Also yf women haue payn yn ther matrice, ete of 
thys oynement as a lectuarye and anoon schal be delyuerd of 
ther payn. Also men in axesse ymade to be anoynted on the 
stomake on the hondys and on the feete and the reynes, and 
anoon to be delyuerd [\p. 46\] and releuyd. Also thys oynyment 
ys for euery mygryme and for euery payne of the ey, yf the 
pacyent be anoynted therwyth - the forhede, the templys, and 
browys. 
 
|P_64 
The secund panycle I wyll 3e knowe. But yf yt be curyd anon 
yn the begynnyng of the growyng þereof, yt wyll not be curyd 
after (the pacyent schal wele se). Ffor when yt ys incarnate and 
hardened vpon the tonycle, þow 3e wolde wyth your twycchys 
lyft it vp and kut yt wyth a rasoure, 3e mowe not so sotyllye kut 
yt but þat 3e shuld kut the tonycle therwyth, wyth whych [\p. 47\] 
kut all the substance of the ey shuld be destroyed anoon. Wherfore 
I counsel yow that when 3e se thys maner of pannycle not 
new but incarnate and harded vpon the tonycle of the eye, take 
yt not in cure, for 3e may haue no worschype þerof but hurtyng 
your name and fame among the people. Neuerthelesse yf 3e 
comme þerto while yt ys new growe and not incarnate vpon the 
saluatryce, cure yt on thys wyse: 
 
Ffyrst yn the [the] begynnyng make a cauterye in the templys 
wyth a rownde cautarye, whych as I schal shew you [\p. 48\] 
afterwarde among my cautaryes, for fire drawyth and dissoluyth 
and cons[{umeth{] and suffryth no pannycle to be incarnate 
vpon the tonycle. And so by drawyng dissoluyng and consumyng 
by þat place cauteryzed, thys maner of pannycle ys 
consumyd wasted and dystroyed and the ey able to be claryfyed 
with the medycyns folowyng. When thys cauterye ys made lyke 
as seyd, anoon put into the pacyent ey, lying wyde open, of the 
powder callyd puluus nabetus, whych [\p. 49\] schal be tau3t 
after. And whyle [{he{]lyeth wyth the powder yn hys ey, take 
iiij crabbys and rost þem, doo awey the pyllys wythoute and the 
coore wythyn, and incorporate them wyth the whyte of an egg 
in maner of a oynement. And ley yt on a plaster of clene flexen 
herdys and bynde yt to the eye wyth a lynnen cloyth. And so let 
yt be from morn tyll yeue, and þen make a new plaster from 
yeue tyl the morn. And thus shall 3e cure al maner of pannycles 
|P_65 
whyle they ar new, and the pacyent schall recouer ly3t and syght 
perfy3tly, to the louyng of gode. 
 
[{[\f. 13\] [}Of the therd pannicle and the cure of it}]
Of the thridde maner of pannicle ys that the whiche apperethe fro the 
on partye of the ey3e as it were whan it snowyth a fleke of snowe. And we 
sayne that same cure ye shull do as we haue saide in the 2e pannicle, as ye 
haue afore, þat is to saye with a [{ca{]uterye in the templis and ye shull 
putte in the ey3e of the pouder nabatis. But natheles putte therto with hym 
this medicyn, the whiche also is gode ayenst the whitenesse of the ey3en, 
forwhi it blakethe the tonicle and it distroiethe the spotte and the whitenesse, 
that is webbes, of the ey3en, and this is the medicyne: 
 
Take ounces 9 of fyne tree of gode aloes, and also hauethe a newe 
platter of stonye erthe full of firy colys. Than lay that aloes tree on the quyk 
colys, and on that other side haue ye a moche clene basyn that maye 
ouerkeuery þat stonen plater withe the colys, so that it may take all that 
smoke and reseyue it into the basyn. And [\f. 13v\] that fume yreseyued, 
than haue ye a nabiatis ounces 9, poudred, and in that bacyn where that 
the fume of aloes ys receyued, medle hym theryn with a 
brasyn pestell till it be made into a right sotill pouder. With that forsaide 
fume of the poudre, medle hem well togiders. Whan this poudre ys ymade 
þus as y haue asayde, than do of this poudre twyes a day naturall, that is 
at the morwe and at euen, into the ey3e. And aboue that laye a plastre 
ymade of applis, as I haue taught you in the secunde pannicle, þan bynde it 
to withe a bonde till it come to his hele ayen. And we haue delyuered and 
ycured many folke with these cures witheouten numbre. 
 
Nowe we shull teche you of what spice ye shull make poudre nabatis 
of, whiche is the properte to deliuer the secunde and the iijde pannicle. The 
zu[{c{]ere nabatis ys made after Arabie tung and Saracenys speche, and 
Turkes clepen it zucre gylop. We Cristin men clepen it zucre nabatis and 
also zucre candi of Alexandri. Of these zucre candi of Alisaunder we make 
|P_66 
poudre nabatis, the whiche poudre doithe many grete merueiles to the 
pannicles [\f. 14\] of the ey3en. Ffirst it makethe nesshe that pannicle for his 
grete moystenes. Secunde it swagethe the ache for his swetenes and his 
mekenes. 3e it distroiethe redenes of ey3en for his purite of [{h{]is hete. 4e 
it fretethe the webbes in the ey3en for [{h{]is hardenes, forwhi or that it be 
dissolued and it be ybrought into water, myghtly it fretethe the webbe. 5 it 
comfor[{te{]the the sight; for yeff any hete be in the ey3en it purifiethe it, 
and also it clereþ the sight and it quickethe the visible spirit. 6 fore [\for\] it 
constraynethe teres yef the teres were of colde humours, for thorugh his hete 
it withtemperethe the coldenes of humours. 
 
[}Of the 4þe pannicle and the cure of it}] 
Of the ferthe pannicle ys whan the ey3e apperethe all white and none 
blake ys ther yseyn, neyþer nothinge of the tonicle of the ey3en neither of the 
sight. Than wete the well that þat fallethe fore the moche akthe that is 
comen doun by the mydward of the heuyd with grete wodenes and furosite, 
and it enclosethe the ey3en all aboute. And for that grete anguisshe of akþe 
the ey3e wexethe white and apperethe in colour as shynyng alabaustre, and 
the pacient fro þens [\f. 14v\] forward seethe nought or yif any of lyght shewe 
yit he seethe but feblyche. Ffor hym semethe that all the worlde ys white, 
and he may not knowe ne shewe o thing from anothir thinge, and his ey3en 
ben alway wateryng and all the naturall white of þe ey3en appereth rede all 
aboute the tonicle ywhited. 
 
The cure of this ys first ye shull make a cautarye in the neysshe of the 
heued, as ye shull see in our cauterijs. And whan ye haue ymade a cautery, 
take to whites of eyren and putte hem in a disshe that is newe and swynge 
hem till they make skume, and afterward lete it rest. And after that kest 
away that skume; and that clere water putte theryn a pece of clene coton 
and, the ey3en yshitte, lay ther abouen x tymes in the daye and x sithes in 
the nyght till the pacient be parfitely hole. With this cures we haue ycured 
to the ffulle the 4e pannicle, fforwhy it is yprouyd and parfitelich it 
|P_67 
worshippithe the leches crafte. Wherefore bethe well ware in these foure 
pannicles and beth nought bolde to putte other medicynes into the ey3e but 
thoo that we han wreten to you. Ffor I do you to vndirstonde þat these 
pannicles were neuer withe none other [\f. 15\] medecyns that ben violent, 
but rather they [{engender{] sorowe and woo and akthe more on anoþer 
woo.{] 
 
[\p. 50\] [}Off the infyrmitees of flewme}]
And lyke as blode arne gendryd obtalmyes and pannycles, 
ry3te so by occasyon of flewme arn gendrid oþer dyuerse 
sekenes. And specyally iiij, of whych the fyrst ys habundance of 
terys by whos grete fluxe the eylyddys arn so molifyed and 
made soft þat withyn grow herys whych pryk the balle of the ey 
contynuelly. Of whych prykkyng the eyon be so troubled þat the 
pacyent may not opon hys eyon. Som boystious and vnconnyng 
leches pullen awey [\p. 51\] the herys, and þan pacyent seeth for a 
tyme. But when the herys growe ayen, than commyth they to 
wors astate, for the more þat þei be pullyd, the gretter and the 
harder they waxen [{and cause farr more greatter paine{] - 
and sum tyme for oon growyth iij or iiij. And tho pryk the eyon 
as swynes brystyll and trouble so the eyon that the pacyent may 
not vpon hys eyon, and many lesen her syght wyth all the 
substance of þer eyon by occasyon of such heyres. Wherfore þis 
dyssease must be cured oþerwyse þan thus. 
 
Take ij nedylles of the length [\p. 52\] of thy lytyll fynger, and 
put a threde thorugh the eyon of boyth, and bynde þem wele 
togydder. Than with thy fyngers lyfte vp the ower eylyde, and 
with these nedyllys take so of the ledder where theys herys 
growe þat the pacyent may opon and schyt hys eyon. And þan 
bynde wele thyse nedlys togydder at boyth endys, and so lett it 
be tyl the nedyls fall away by þemselfe wyth the pese of ledder 
that was betweyne þem. The whych doon, put no medycyne yn 
|P_68 
the wonde þat the nedlys haue mayd, for yt shall hele wele 
ynowe [\p. 53\] by ytselfe, but yf any pannycle or rankyll be 
gendyrde on the ey by vyolence of the peyn and þat schall be 
curyd with the powder callyd puluis nabetus put yn the ey twyes 
on the day tyl the ey be claryfyed and ful helyd. And wyth thys 
sekenes of eyon, quod my autor, I founde moo ywoxen yn 
Calabur þen in ony oþer prouynce, and specyally of women. 
And thys preciosus powder we calle puluis nabetus, and yt ys 
mayd of sugyr, whych in Arabyk tong the Sarasyns call sugar 
gelypp, and Crysten men cal yt sugar candy of Alexander. 
[\p.54\] Thys powder ys goode and syker to hole al sekenes of 
eyon. 
 
The second sekenes cawsyd of flewme in the eyon ys when þei 
appere trobled and ful of venys closed with a pannycle so that 
the pacyent may not wele se. And thys sekenes we calle pannum 
vitreum off whych thys ys the cure: 
 
Ffyrst at the begynnyng doo shaue of all the hede, and than 
cauterye hym with a rownde cauterye yn the soft of hys hede 
and wyth a long cauterye yn hys templys. Whych so doon, put 
yn hys eyon oonys of þis pouder of candye onys of the daye 
[\p. 55\] tyl he receyue ayen ful sy3te. And twyes yn the monyth 
pourge hym wythoute wyth pelettes callyd pulule Iherosolomitane, 
and when he goyth to bede lete hym resceyue of our 
electuarye clepyd dyaolibanum Salernitanum tyl he be hole. 
And of thys sekenes we founde many mo pacyentes yn Tuscia 
[{and{] Marchia þen yn ony oþer contreys. 
 
The thyrde infirmytee caused of flewme: when the ey 
apperyth carnous or fleshly, whych carnosyte or fleshelynes, yf 
yt be woxen harde vpon the eye a yere or ij or mo, yt may not 
be cured, neiþer wyth [\p. 56\] pouders, neþer coloryus, 
for it shuld nothyng avayle. Wherfore, as I sayd before, the 
pacyentes hede must be shauyn and cauteryzede ffyrst, as I 
|P_69 
sayd yn the cure before. And on the nexte day after, opyn the 
pacyentes eyon wyth your fyngurs and with a rasure cut all the 
carnosytee, so warly and so sotylly þat 3e touche not the tonycle 
saluatrice, whych Iohannycius clepyth the coniunctyfe. But 
rounde abowt the tonycle betwene the blak and the whyte, soft 
and sotylly cut yt tyll 3e haue reysed all the carnosytee. Whych 
so doon, fyll the ey ful [\p. 57\] of the powder of candie without 
ony oþer thyng. Then doo the pacyent shitt hys ey and þeron ley 
a plaster of coton or of flaxen herdys wyth the whytte of an egg, 
and xv days after chaunge the plaster twyes on a day. And after 
xv days make thys plaster: take an handful of an herbe callyd 
cardus benedictus, sowthystyl yn Englych, stampe yt wele and 
medyl yt with halfe the whyte of an egg. And make a plaster of 
coton or flaxen herdys and ley yt on the ey iij days, remeuyng 
the plaster euery [\p. 58\] daye, eche day twyes, morn and yeue. 
And after iij dayes complete, leue all plasters and lete the 
pacyent sye with open ey. And euery daye at morn put yn the 
sore eyon of the powder callyd puluis benedictus, and at eue of 
the powder callyde puluis nabetus, tyl he be perfy3tly hoole. 
And yn the meanetyme let hym abstene hym from elys, 
oyneones, and befe and all oþer queysy metys. And with thys 
maner of medycyne, quod myn autor, I haue holpen and curede 
without nombre of people. Of thys sekenes, quod he, I fonde 
mo in Sardonia [\p. 59\] than yn oþer countrees. 
 
The forth sekenes causyd of flewme yn the ey is when the 
eyon apere bolleyn and be allweys wepyng, and the pacyent 
may not opyn hys eyon for the ponderosyte and the heuynes of 
the ouerlyddys. And yf 3e wyll, quod he, be verryly certyfyed of 
thys sekenes, turne the ouerlydde of the ey with your fyngers 
and 3e schal se it appere all fatty, and the fatnes shall be greynous 
as much as the greynes of a myle. Whych sekenes Sarasyns 
and yn Arabye ys callyd iherafrumaxyn, þat ys to sey scab yn 
the eye. [\p. 60\] And thys sekenes ys gendred of superhabundance 
of salt flewme. To whych sekenes do thys cure: 
 
|P_70 
Fyrst 3e must pourge the stomake and the brayne of the 
pacyent with þis resceyte: Take turbyt, aloes, epatyk, rubarbe 
lyche of ycche an vnce; then take the juce of the roote of 
walworte a pounde and the forseyd thynges poudered and resoluyd 
yn the sayd jus. And let yt stond all a nyght, and betyme or 
the morn clense yt, and lete the pacyent take þerof fastyng a 
good quantite. And on the nexte day after that wyth your 
fyngurs tornyth the eylyddys, and [\p. 61\] softly with a twycche 
lyft the carnositee and with a rasure begynne to cut the greynes 
yn fatnese tha[{t{] ys vnder the eyelede, euyn from that oon 
lacrymal to the tooþer. Whych doon, plaster the eye wyth herdys 
and the whytte of an egg, and so do ix days, eche daye 
chaungyng the plaster twyes. And after the ix days lay þerto the 
playster gracious aforseyd, [{[\f. 18\] the whiche ys ymade of cardus 
benedictus with the white of an eye{], twyes on the daye iij days 
foloyng, after whych tyme lat the pacyent haue hys eyon opyn. 
And alwey at yeven put yn hys ey of oure colerye callyd colerium 
Alexandrinum, whych ys tau3t before yn [\p. 62\] the cure 
of the thyrde pannycle, tyl he be perfytely hoole. And wyth 
thys, quod he, I haue curyd muche people. 
 
And of thys sekenes I founde moyste yn Barbarye 
among the Sarasyns. And when I was þer, quod he, I fonde 
women vsyng thys cure: They tooke the braunches of the fyg 
tree and turnyd the eyelyddys, and with the leuys they rubbyd 
the sore place tyl the eyledys weren all blodye. And many were 
amendyd þerby, but yt lastyd not long. And som rubbyd þat 
fatnes wyth suger; for a tyme þei were amendyd, but soon 
[\p. 63\] after yt tornyd ayen into the fyrste estate. 
 
And now I wyl teche yow practysers a merveilous and a 
precious lectuarye for the forsayd terys, and yt ys thys: Take 
olibam, castorij, nootmygges, nucys Indie, clouys, cubibes ana 
an vnce; and of the leuys of laurei, spynarde, saferon, cardomomi 
|P_71 
ana a quartron; halfe an vnce seedys of dylle; of smalache, 
basylycon seede, of alexander, of annes, and of fenel ana 
halfe an vnce; drye neppe, pulyal, ysop, sede of rewe ana iiij 
drammes; seed of henbane, whytte popee, muske, [\p. 64\] campher 
ana a dram. Bete all thyes to powder and sotylly sarce 
them, saue the olybanum; that must be boylyde wyth claryfyed 
hony tyl yt be molton. Then take yt from the fyre and power yt 
ynto a feir plater large and of tree wyth the oþer powders, and 
wyth a lytyl ladyl styre yt togyddyr tyll the spycys be yncorporate 
wyth the hony; and lete yt be kept styll yn the same 
plater. And 3e shall cure your pacyentes: Yeue them at yeue 
when þei goo to bede of thys lectuarye the quantite of a chesteyne. 
And thys lectuarye, quod he, ys callyd meruelous [\p. 65\] 
and prescious ffor yt doth many prescious merueleus. Hyt dystroyth 
the teres and flewme, yt warmyth the brayn, it puttyth 
awey the peyne of the mygreyme, it openyth the eyon, it 
releuyth the eylyddys and clarifyth the syght. It is also good for 
the eyon þat haue the gowte and the palsye, item for them þat 
haue loost their speche or haue impedyment yn spekyng. Al 
thyes I haue preuyd, quod he, and as I here wryte so haue I 
founde and manny haue I holpen. 
 
[}Off the infirmytees causyd of coolore}]
[\p. 66\] Now after thys, quod the autor, I shall trete of the sekenes of 
the eyon causyd of coler, whych byth ij. Wherof the first ys 
causyd of superhabundance of coler yn the stomake, of the 
whych ys resoluyd a corrupte fumosytie þat ascendyth vp to the 
brayn with greete furowre and pyne, wherof the eyon be so 
troublyd þat betwene þem and their obiecte, þat ys the thyng, ys

feire and bryght, and neiþer yn the eyon nor wythoute ys no 
spot [\p. 67\] aperyng; and þerfore the defaute of thys ys not yn 
the eye but in the stomake, and þerfore no medycyne schal be 
put yn the ey but in the stomake. And the cure þerof shal be 
with a electuarye mytigatyf and aperytyf, whych shal swage the 
|P_72 
peyne and opyne the opylate holes - neruys - þat þe uisible spyryt 
maye frely passe þereby. And þus shal be the lectuarye 
made: 
 
Take rubarbe, esule minorys, rede sawnders, mirabolys 
cytrine ana iiij vnces; the rotys of fenel, sperages, brusces, parcely, 
smalach, [{u{]i[{t{]acelle, cycorye, [\p. 68\] capyllys 
veneris ana of eche an handful; polypody of the oke ij vnces. 
Boyl all thies herbys yn feir water to the halfe be wasted, and 
þen clense yt. Than take the forseyd spycys wele powderd and 
put þem to the seyd lycour wyth ij pounde of suger and make 
þerof a syrup laxatyff. But when 3e put the spycys and suger, 
beware þat yt boylle not after but lytle, for þan shal the spycys 
lese theyr wertu and her myght. And when it ys redy clense yt 
ageyn, and of thys syrup lete the pacyent drynk twyes yn the 
weke. [\p. 69\] And yn the menetyme lete hym abstene hym from 
contraryous metys and from such as byth of harde dygestyon, 
and also lete hym be cauteryzed on the templys besydys the erys 
as 3e, quod he, schall se assygned in my cauteryes. 
 
The secunde sekenes causyd of color ys whan þer aperyth 
vpon the tonycle of the eye before the syght as yt were a thyn 
clowde yn a clere eyre, and vnneth yt may be seyn. And thys 
sekenesse fallyth not but to þem to whom and yn whom coler 
reygnyth and when þei be yn an accesse. And when the acces ys 
[\p. 71\] goon, thys dysease remayneth for lak of due cure 
betyme. And for þat absteyne not from contraryous metys, but 
for thys sekenes thys ys the cure: 
 
Take a saphyr and breke yt yn a morter ynto sotyl powder, 
and the powder to be kept yn a vessyl of golde. And onys on the 
day put of þat yn the pacyentes eye, and he shall be hoole yn 
schort tyme. The same doth the galle of a bawson yf yt be dryed 
and powderred and put yn the eye [{[\f. 20\] onys a day, and he 
|P_73 
shall be deliuered at full thorugh this medicyne. Also take fenell sede ounces 
iiij on the tother side and thre parties of poudre nabatis on the tone side, 
and in a brasyn morter make poudre of the forsaide gumme and medle it 
and afterwarde do hem bothe into the morter togiders till bothe be right 
sotill and do this poudre into the ey3e. And fforsothe it dothe thre thingis: 
first it freteth the webbe, 2e and it softethe and clerethe the ey3e and it 
conseruethe light till [{h{]is lyues ende. Wherfor on þe [\f. 20v\] gumme 
of fenell Ypocras and Galien and all the olde leches were accorded togeders 
and helde it for a high medecyn, and wete ye well that they nemenyd it none 
gumme but fenell, for þey nould naught shewe wherein his vertue was. And 
for certayne we wole shewen ffor they praysed the herbe and the sede but 
nought the gumme, though they couthe hit but they hidden where that the 
verray trewth was. Wherfor with that holy herbe we haue delyuerd many, 
and that þat was hidde nowe it is open and proued.{] 
 
[}Off the infyrmytees of malencolye}]
[\p. 72\] For the humor malencoly ys gendyrd y[{n{] myche peple, 
many dyuerse dysease yn eyon come þerof, wherof oon ys thys. 
Sumtyme for the habundance of malencolye the brayn ys so 
troublyd þat the nerfe obtyk ys so opylate and stoppide þat the 
vysyble spyryt may not passe the ryght wey. And when thys 
nerfe ys oppylate and ouerleid þen aperen afore the pacyentes 
eyon as yt were fleyng flyes yn the ayre on the daylyght. And of 
a lanterne of ly3te or of the moone, yt [\p. 73\] semyth þat yt were 
iiij, and yf he loke yn the face of a man yt semyth to hym the 
same. Thys maner of sekenes yt happenyth to them raþer þat be 
naturally malycolyus when þei vexen aged, raþer than to men of 
oþer complexion. Wherfor the practysers when 3e se such a 
pacyent put no medycyne yn hys eye but make hym a lectuarye 
mytygatyff and aperytyff, whych schall swage the peyn and 
open the opylacion of the hole neruys þat the spyryt of syght 
may passe esely by them. And þus it shal be made: [\p. 74\] 
 
|P_74 
Take suger, lycoryse, eufrasie, siler mownten, and hylwort 
ana halfe a pounde; off the seedys of rewe, basylycon, urtice 
vltra marine, fenel, alexander, smalege, caruy ana ij vnces; 
masticus, clowys, notmygges, cynomom, cubibe, gumme of 
almandys, cerase, pyonie, gummarum Arabici, draganti, 
safron halfe an vnce; grana cytemorum, pioniorum an vnce. All 
thyes muste be betyn togydder to smal pouder and wele sarsed 
and þan confect wyth goode suger and make a lectuarye. And of 
thys lete the pacyent [\p. 75\] ete fyrst at morn and laste at yeven, 
and he shal be hoole. Thys sayd lectuarye ys not oonly good for 
thys sekenes but also for all tho whych see not clerely but haue 
yn maner a myste yn þer eyon, causyd eiþer of thou3t and grete 
heuynes of a grete weepyng or of wacche or of fastyng or of such 
oþer. And þerfor thys lectuarye ys clepyd clarificacio oculorum, 
this ys the clarifyers of eyon. 
 
Ther ys also anoþer sekenes causyd of malyncolye and yt ys 
when the payne sodonly ascendyth ynto [\p. 76\] the eyon and so 
greuou[{s{]ly þat it semyth the eyon wolde stert oute of theyr 
places, and þei aperyn passyngly bollen. And of thys maner of 
pacyentes som lese holy þer syght, and som seen but feblye. 
And not forthan all thyes may be holpe yf they be cured yn the 
begynnyng of theyr sekenes wyth thyes medycynes that I shal 
sey yow. Ffyrst the stomake and the brayn must be porged wyth 
our pelates of comforth, whych ar made on thys wyse: 
 
Take aloes, epatyk, mirabolys cytryne, turbyt, [\p. 77\] saunders, 
citrine, rubarbe ana half an vnce; scamony, safrone, 
balsami, mirre, mastyci, lygnum aloes, olibanum album, agaricus, 
nuces Indie, succum [{liqueritiae{], the seed of smalache, 
letuce, cicorie, basylicon ana of each a drame. Bet all ynto 
powder and confecte þem wyth the jows of roses and make 
pelatys, and yif yt the pacyent after hys power. And when the 
|P_75 
stomake and the brayn ben powrged, ley on the ey my plaster 
clepyd emplastrum laudabile, whych ys made on thys wyse: 
 
Take [\p. 78\] sowre apples, þat ys crabbes, and roost þem 
hoote yn the embrys tyll they soft; then voyde away the parow 
and the core and bruse þem wele yn a morter. And to iiij 
crabbys put the whyte of an egg glayre and bray þem togeddyr 
tyl þei be incorporatte yn maner of an oynement. And of thys 
lawdable plaster ley on flexen herdys and plaster yt on the 
eye twyes on the daye, morn and yeuen. And yn thys wyse ye 
shal cure thys maner of disease yf it be aplied and vsed at the 
begynnyng. Of thys plaster thyes be vertues: [\p. 79\] ffyrst yt 
swagyth the bolnyng, it settyth the eye fyxe yn hys place, it 
lesseth the payn, and refreshyth the syght; and for thies causes I 
cal it laudable, that ys worthy to be praysed. 
 
Also superhabundance of the humor of malencolye is often 
gendryd yn the ey a dysease callyd vngula, a nayle, for it ys 
muche lyke a fyngernayle, and begynnyth comonly to growe in 
lacrimabili minore, þat ys to sey yn the corner of the eye to the 
ere-ward. And the course of the growyng ys toward the pupil, 
þat ys to sey to the sy3te. And yf it [\p. 80\] be not cut away or it 
ocupye the pupil and let the sy3ght, afterwarde it wyll not be 
easely curyd. Also sumtyme þere growyth anoþer vngyll in the 
corner of the eye nexte the noose, and yf thies ij happyn to be 
knyt togydder and to occupye all the eye and to let all the 
sy3ght, þan it ys more hard to cure. But not forthan boyth be 
curable but by grete dyscrecion and sotyl workyng or wrythyng 
of the honde, and þis must be the cure: 
 
Take a twych of syluer and þerwyth sotylly lift vpe [\p. 81\] the 
vngle from the tonycle [{[\f. 22v\] and so with a rasour kutte her{], 
procedyng forthe to the lacrymal where he toke hys growyng. 
And when it is all cut awey wyth a rasour sotilly, lete the 
pacyent spere yn hys eye and lay þerto a plaster of the whyte of 
an egg x dayes folowyng, twyes on the day renewed, whych so 
past lete hym wash hym with hote water. And þan put yn hys ey 
|P_76 
at morn and euyn of my powder callyd puluis nabetus tyl the 
eye be clere sufficyently. And yn the menetyme lete hym 
absteyne hym from contraryous metys, and noon oþer medycyne 
yn the eye. [\p.82\] 
 
It happyth sum tyme þat the malencolyous humor habundant 
yn the brayn begynnyth to haue hys course by the eyon, and for 
the superhabundance þereof it makyth the eyledys to wexe drye. 
And þat drynes tornyth after to an ycche and to brynnyng, and 
the cause of thys brynnyng and ycche ys for that he tooke no 
purgacion yn the begynnyng of the sekenesse nor absteyned 
from contraryous metys. Off thys dysease thus ys the cure: yf 
the pacyent be yong, lete hym blode on the veyne yn the myddys 
of the forhede. Whych so doon [\p. 83] cure hym with a 
colerie clepid colerium ruborum, thus made: 
 
Take xlti tendyr croppys of the bremyl and stampe them as 
smale as sauce and put it yn a new erthen pot with a quarte of 
goode whyte wyne and boyle it wyth an esy fyre tyl halfe be 
consumede. Than clense yt and kepe it yn a glasse, wherof 
twyes yn the day put yn the pacyentes eye and noon oþer thyng 
tyl he be hole. And thys colerie ys goode ageyne al skaldyng and 
rednesse of the maladie of the forseyd sekenes. Quod the autor, 
I fonde mo yn Rome than yn any [\p. 84\] othir prouince. 
 
Moreoure of such superfluyte of malencolie sumtyme þere 
grouyth a corupte humor wythout the eye betwyxte the place 
where the here growyth and the eyelydde, whych bolnyth not 
oonly the eyelydde but all the eye wyth halfe the face, but it 
hurtyth not the eye. And men of Tuskan calle it humeris benedictum; 
them of Rome call it nexionam; and men of Cicile and 
Grekys cal it papulam; but the citramowntayns and Frenshemen 
and oþer cal it maledictam - and no wonder, for yt growyth 
with grette soroues and [\p. 85\] grete peyn. And thies ben 
the knowyng þerof: it makyth the eyledys al harde, red, and 
bolnyn and kepyth the ey so shyt þat the pacyent may not open 
it. Off whych disease thys is the cure: 
 
|P_77 
Take fyne pure flowre of olde whete and 3elkys of egges as 
much of ech an vnce; of safron a drame. And stampe them wele 
togeddyr wyth womans mylke, mollifi yt tyl yt be as an oynement, 
wherof make a plaster and lay it to the sore. And 
betweyne the ij eylyddys ley a smayl lyst of lynnen cloyth to 
kepe [\p. 86\] þat noon of the plaster entre ynto the ey. 
And iij tymes doo þis plaster. It gederyth toogheder all the 
humors into oon place; than after rypeth it; and for the þryd yt 
swagyth the payn. And wyth þis many haue ben holpen of thys 
disease. 
 
Anoþer medicyne also for the same: Take a lilie roote and 
roost yt yn hoot embers; take also crabbys and rooste hem yn 
the hoote fyre or embrys - is better tyll þei be roost. Þan avoyde 
the perrowr and the core and stampe þem and the root 
togydder, as mych by weyght of the [\p. 87\] toon as of the tooþer, 
tyl þei be welle incorporate and temper þem with the whitte of 
egges tyll þei be wele liquyde. And plaster the sore wyth this 
onyment tyl all the humor be consumyd and that the ey may 
open and shytte. And on the stepe of the wonde there the sore 
was ley on an oynement callyd vnguentum subtile, whych ys 
made thus: 
 
Take aloe, epatik, hennys grece, oyle of bitter almandys, and 
white waxe ana of ycche one ounce, and incorporate them 
togheder into an oynement. And þis shal consowdyn and subtilizen 
so the [\p. 88\] skyn of the wonde þat þer shal no step 
apperyn yn the wonde. 
 
Also I counsel yow þat ye haue wyth you vnguentum alabastrum, 
and yn euery cure of the eyon onys yn the day, þat is at 
even, anoynte the pacyentes forhede, templys, and browis 
þerwyth, ffor þat helpyth your medicyns and swagyth the peyne 
and suffryth not the humors to descend to the hurt place and it 
makyth the pacyent to haue rest. 
 
Moreoure, quod Beneuucius, I wyl þat 3e practysers 
|P_78 
[{know{] that many of þem þat suffre this seid sekenes cum 
[\p. 89\] to me with þeir eylydys reuersed foule for lak of sufficyent 
cure, as þei sey to me, and so yt was yn whos eure yt 
procedid. Ffor wyth a rasor I deuyed it suttilly and discretely 
the eylyd from the cycatryes of the wonde, so þat the eyelede 
myght turne up and down. Which so doon, I made a lytyl 
pylowe of lynnen cloth yn the maner of a lytyl chyldys fynger 
and wett it in the whyte of an egg and layd þer vpon and bonde 
it to wyth a lynnen bande to the nexte remeuyng a3en. And so 
contynue þis [\p. 90\] medycyne daylly to the xv daye, and than I 
made an oynement of hennys grece and of whyte wexe. And 
þerwyth I anoynted the pelowe lyke as I dyd before wyth the 
whyte of an egg and leyd it on the cicatryce or on the wonde, 
like as I haue doon before tyl it was perfi3tly sensowdid and the 
eylyde hole and yn good astate. Or els sumtyme I made a 
pelowe of a sponge and leyd it on the wounde, for the propurte 
of the sponge is to distroye waste flech, to drawe and to quyken 
the spiryt [\p. 91\] of the blode, and to consowdyn and knit the 
wounde and to bryng yt to good astate. 
 
And on thys wyse, quod he, I cured all that hade þere eylydys 
turnyd by the same cause. Neþerthelees of thys turnyng of the 
eyleddis of superhabundance of superfluite of blode not curid 
wythyn a yere, beware the practisers that 3e enter not the vtter 
parte of the eyelydde, but wyth a twycche sotilly lifte vp the 
corner where the wast fleche ys vnder the eyelyd. And wyth a 
rasur cutt it so discretly þat 3e touche not the parte of the eylede 
that [\p. 92\] the here growyth. Whych so doon, ley þerto such 
smale pelatis as it ys saidyn the cure before, and change it twyes 
on the day till it be ful hoole. And of thys maner of seke folkys I 
found moyst yn Tuskeyn than yn any oþer prouince. 
 
And also of the malencolyus humor, quod the autor, ther is 
gendrid yn many men a sekenes that growyth betwene the nose 
|P_79 
and the ey, and it apperyth lyke the pece of a long and it [{is{] 
grauelous and voydyth allway fylth, and communly it towchyth 
withyn the ouer eyelede and also the neþer. And [\p. 93\] in many 
placis thys sore is clepyd muri or wulgalpus, off whych thys ys 
the cure: 
 
Wyth a twych sotylly lyft vp the sore and wyth the poynt of a 
rasour cut yt vp by the roote. And then wyth a hoote yron 
cauteryse it yn the place where the sore tooke hys orygynal 
begynnyng so weryly that 3e hurt not the eye, and annoynt it 
with the oynement callyd vnguentum subtile tyll it be hoole. 
 
In the fyrst partye of thys tretys, 3e practysers, quod my 
autor, I declared to yow [\p. 94\] what an eye is and how it ys 
maid, after myn opynyon and oþer menys also, and what is a 
cateracte and how many spycys be þereof curable and how 
many vncurable, and how the cure of the curable ys and how þe 
cure of the vncurable ys by an easy delyuerance of honde by a 
craft callyd ars acuaria, that is the crafte of the nedyl. And after 
yn the secunde partye I tau3t yow of the infirmitees of eyon that 
be caused inwarde by occasyon of distemperance of the iiij 
humors, þat [\p. 95\] ys to wyt blode, color, flewme, and malyncolye, 
and þeir cures. And now yn thys thyrde partye and last of 
my tretys, I wyll tel yow of þies hurtis and diseases causyd yn 
eyon from wythouteward, as wyth smytyng of stekkys and 
stonys and staues or ony such oþer. Wherfore here ere that I 
procede to any specyall cure, I generally counseyl yow that 
when 3e se any suche come to yow, socowre them wyth the 
whyte of an egg - and as sone as 3e mowe, leyng to the ey a 
plaster made of flexen hurdys and the whyte of [\p. 96\] an egg. 
And yff it happen for the grete payn the humurs of the eye be 
distroyd and dyssoluyd, and thys plaster renewith iiij sythes on 
the day and twys on the ny3te xv days togydder. And yf it 
happyn by the hurte takyn the tonycle to be hurte or brokyn, 
|P_80 
put twyes on the day and oonys of the nyght of a medycyne 
founde be practyffe callyd virtus a deo data, whos makyng shal 
be tau3t anoon after. But forþan ley not the forseyd plaster 
tyl the forseyd tyme be past, and also foryetyth not anoyntyng 
the pacyentys templys, hys forhede [\p. 97\] and his browes with 
the prescyous oynement of alabastrum. And yf þei that be hurte 
or smyten wyth thys be not curyd on the seid wyse betymes at 
the begynnyng ere that theey begynne to bolne or to roote, þei 
shal neuer be cured nor helyd wyth any oþer medycyne. 
 
Ffor I wyll 3e knowe iij grete vertuous of the white of an egg, 
and specyally for suche smytyng. The first it swagith the sorow 
and the payn, the secunde it constrenyth the humors of the eyon 
and purifyeth the eyon, the thyrd it suffryth no superfluyte of 
humors [\p. 98\] to come into the eyon. And as for the medycyne 
callyd virtus a deo data that knyttyth and sowdeth the tonycle 
ageyn yf it be brokyn, and it is made on thys wyse: 
 
Take xij strenus of new freshe leyd egges of white hennys and 
put them in a morter and labur them wele with a pestel tyl thei 
be wele yncorporate togydder yn maner of a oynement. And 
þan put it yn a vessel of glase and put it yn the eye, as it ys seyd 
before, twyes on the daye and oonys on the nyght. Ffor lyke as 
othyr consolydatyfe oynementys [\p. 99\] consowdyn and purifye 
othir wondys, so thys vertu youen of god consowdyth the tonycle 
of the eye yf it be hurte and purifie[{th{] the eye. And with 
thys ryght vertuous medycyne many one haue I cured and 
holpen - men, women, and chyldren - yn dyuers placys. 
 
Amonge whych yn a cetee callyd Messana was brought to me 
a chylde whos eye was oute yn the myddys so that I myght se iij 
humers, and wyth thys forseyde medycyne I saued hys eye 
hoole. But he myght not see for hys ey was cataracte of the 
vyolence of the [\p. 100\] stroke, as it ys declaryd beforn yn the 
fyrst spice of the curable cataract. Wherfore I lete hym be so iiij 
|P_81 
monethys after tyll the cataract was confermed, and þan I cured 
hym as I haue tau3t beforn yn the curable cataract. On thys 
wyse shall 3e cure all tho þat arn hurte in the ey wyth stroke or 
smytyng - and not os lewde leches arn wont to doo wyth a 
plaster made of waxe and powder of comyn, whych they leyd 
hoot to the ey hurte and broken. For yf the tonycle of the eye be 
hurte or brokyn, anoon it drawyth [\p. 101\] all the substance of 
the eye and consumyt the humors. For wex of his propurtee 
drawyth and consumyth, and commyn dyssoluyth and meltyth. 
And thus by drawyng, dyssoluyng, and consumyng, the eye ys 
distroyed and ys foule dysfigured. And the ey be smytyn and 
hurte wythoute brekyng of the tonycle, than this plaster drawyth 
þereto the spyrit and the humors and causyth grete sorowe 
rounde abowte the eye, and so betyth boyth the ey and the 
templys that often the ey ys wasted and dystroyed þerby, as I 
haue often [\p. 102\] founde yn dyuers placys. Also sum haue lost 
þeir sy3te wyth plasters made of wormewode and olibanum and 
of such hote and dissouatyfe thyng. Wherfore I counsel you to 
beware of all suche plasters, and haue allweye yn all hurtys of 
eyon caused of owtwardys by stroke or smytyng to the gracyous 
medycyne of the whyte of egges that I haue tolde, yf 3e wyll not 
erre. 
 
But here it ys to be noted and vnderstonde that yn my Laten 
[{co{]py lacked an hoole chapytere, in which tretys of [\p. 103\] 
hurtys taken aboute the eyon, as by strokys of the forehede and 
the browys, the eylyddes, the boyth lacrymalles, the temples, 
and such oþer of their cures. And moreouere the nexte chapyter 
folowyng in the begynnyng lakked sumwhat, but not muche as 
I suppose, wher he tretyth of watry eyon and of teres, of corrupte 
humors lyke teres whych leches callen festeles. 
 
[{[\f. 28v\] [}Of smytyng of [\f. 29\], þe ey3eliddes and in the temples and

Now we shull teche of the smytyng the whiche ben ayenst the ey3e, as

abought the ey3e though it towch not the ey3e; the ey3e apperethe clere and 
neuerthelesse hit hathe losten his lyght, ffor that smytyng neruus opticus is

Also þe smytyng of the templis, it distourblethe the humours of the ey3en; 
fforwhy the pacient may nought clerelich se summe tyme, and yef it so be it

Wherfor whan ye see any such, beholdethe into þat ey3e and yef the balle of

whan he hathe these signes, as we haue ysaide, dothe no cure ffor the

habundeþ [\f. 30\] and wexethe more and more and it entrethe into the 
|P_83 
ey3en and than they appere alwey teryfull.{] Wherfore, quod 
Benuynucius, of them oure lorde Ihesu yaue knowlege and 
experiens of the infirmytees of eyon, humors and complexyons, 
and the cures. Yf practysers wyll [\p. 104\] verely be 
certyfyed wheþer the humor be a ffistula or a clere tere, do 
þus: puttyth your secunde fyngers ende, whych ys callyd index 
(the shewyng fynger), betwene the nose and the lacrimall, 
besyde the neþer eyelede, and þere shall 3e se the corrupte 
humor that is the mater of the fystyl goyng oute by the poyntys 
of the eyeleddys betwene the nose and the eye. But many 
boystus leches and ignorant, not knowyng the very place of 
yssuyng of the corrupte, whych ys the mater of the fystyll, but 
weenyng that the goyng out of the corrupcioun were yn the [\p. 
105\] myddys of the lacrymal besydys the nose betwyxt boyth 
the eyeledys, and þei vsen for to cure a craft that ys a cause of 
lesyng of manny mans sy3thtys. And it ys thus: 
 
They taken an hoote yron and make a cauterye vpon the nose 
yn the myddys of the lacrimall betwyx the ouere ylede and the 
neþer lyd, weenyng for to dry vp the place where the corrupt 
mater of the fystyl ys gendryd. But þei do not curee but deforme 
foule the face yn the place whych þei cauteryze, and many, as I 
haue seyd, deforrem and dystreyen the sy3th [\p. 106\] of the 
vysyble synews that arn clepyd nerui optici, goyng betwyxt 
besyde the nose, by the cautaryzacion ben dried and the sy3te 
destroyed. Wherfore yf 3e wyll not dysteyne your name nor hurt 
your pacyentes in cure of thys maner of fystyl, leue thys forseyd 
lewde craft and do as I schall teche yow: 
 
Ffyrst clense the pacyentys stomake wyth the peletys of Ierusalem 
wherof the makyng ys tau3t before. Whych purgacion 
made, þen 3e shall make a lytle insysyon wyth the poynt of a 
rasor betwyxt the neþer eylyd and the nose, so dyscretly 
[\p. 107\] that 3e touch not the eyelede and the nose neþer the substance of 
the eye. And thys incysion or kuttyng shal be but oonly þorugh 
the skyn in lenghtwyse. In whych yncysion put the grane of a 
|P_84 
fecche and lay þeron a lytle pylowe made of lynnen cloth and 
bynd it wyth a lynnen bende that the fecche remoue not from 
the place where it is leyd, and so lete it lye tyl the nexte day. 
Than remoue the fecche and yn the hole that it hath made ley of 
the coresey and mortyificat powder whych I shall teche yn the 
ende of the tretis [\p. 108\] ageyne all maner of fystylles whersoeuere 
they be. Whych powder put yn, do the pacyens shyt hys 
eye that the powder may not entre, or vpon the eyelyd lay a 
plaster of coton or flexen hardys iwet yn the whyte of an egg, 
and bynd it þerto wyth a lynnen bande tyl the nexte day. And 
þan anoynte yt or ley þerto clene freshe swynes grece tyl the 
mortifyed fleshe be reysed vp wyth the powder and the place 
remayne opyn. And than shal 3e se the place putrifyed wher the 
begynnyng of the corrupte mater of the fystyl was and how the 
cowrs [\p. 109\] þereof yn the lacrymall shal be dryed. And after 
thys take a lytle pece of a sponge the quantyte of a fecche and ley 
yt yn the hoole that the powder mayd tyl it be pourgyd and 
dryed, ffor the propurte of the spounge ys to opyn, to consume 
wykkyd humors. And when the place ys dryed boyth be the 
poynt of the lacrymall and the cicatryce made by the fyrst incysyon, 
than leue the sponge and ley þereto nat els but fayre lynet 
of feyr lynnen cloth wythoute ony maner of oynyment tyl yt be 
perfy3tly consowded - and so shall the[{y{] be delyuerd 
wythout perell. [\p. 110\] Neuerthelees euery ny3te whyle he ys 
yn curyng when he goth to bedde, yeue hym of oure electuarie, 
callyd electuarium mirabile, the quantite of a chasteyn. 
 
Now I haue shewed, quod he, the knowlege of corrupt terys, 
wherof ben caused fystyllys and the cures of them. Now I teche 
yow the verry knowlege of verry terys and yn what place they 
veryly spryng. Many mene wene that wepyng terys come out of 
the eyon, but yt is not so. For theyr yssue ys oute of the eyeledys 
boyth the ouer and the neþer at the holes [\p. 111\] yn the lacrimal 
|P_85 
besyde the nose at the ende of the grounde of the herys, as 3e 
shall euydently aspye yf 3e wyll reuerse and turne the eyledys. 
But nat forthan þere is different causes of teres whych spryng 
out of the ouer eylede and whych spryng oute of the nether, ffor 
tho whych come out of the nether eyelyde proceden from the 
hert, eyther for sorow, drede or smart, and be caused by a 
maner of vyolence. But they be not durable nor abydyng, for 
when the cause þerof cesyth þei sesyn. But the teres 
[\p. 112\] whych cum oute of the hoole of the ouer lyd of the ey proceden 
from the brayn and be causid of sum corrupcion of habundans, 
of superfluytee of humors, and her cours ceceth not but yf the 
mater be pourgyd and holpen wyth oure electuaryes and cautaryes, 
lyke as we haue tau3th beforne. 
 
Now after that I haue tau3th yow, quod he, of the hurtys that 
comme to the eyon outwarde, as by strokys yn the forhede, 
templys or browys, and naturally of corrupte [\p. 113\] and 
naturale terys; now wyll I speke of the hurtys whych casually 
falle vnto dyuers artifycers, as to masons, myllers, wryghtys, 
smythes, and oþer. Ffor yt happyth þat sum of here fragmentys 
sterte ynto there eyes vnwysyli, and rechelesly be left þeryn tyll 
þei be incarnate vpon the tonycles of the ey; and the payn 
causeth contynually þer eyon to water so that the pacyent may 
no[{t{] wele opon hys eye. And of thyes 3e schal fynde som þat 
haue the fragment of ston or of styke opon the lyght incarnat, 
som besyde the lyght, and som betwene [\p. 114\] the blak and the 
white. And of all thyes þer ys but oon maner of cure, and yt ys 
thus: 
 
Make the pacyent to sytt downe and bakwarde to ley hys 
hede betwene your legges. And þen doo hym shyt hys hoole eye, 
and after open the sore eye and wyth a nedyll of syluer deuyde 
the fragment from the place þat it ys on so sotelly and so discretely 
that yn no wyse 3e hurt not the tonycle, but lede it so 
|P_86 
softly and so sotylly yn the maner of a barbor vpon a mans 
berde. And so ledyng forth the nedyll by maner of shauyng, 3e 
shall remoue it from the place wher it lay. [\p. 115\] And that 
doon, 3e shall easely haue it out, and yit yn the place wher yt lay 
be made a grete pyt. Put into the eye of the oynement callyd the 
vertu youen of god whych I taugte before, and on the eye 
withoute lay a plaster of flaxen hurdys wyth the whyte of an 
egge twyes on the day and oonys of the nyght. And withyn iij 
dayes he shall be hoole. And yf the fragment be long þeron and 
be not cured on this seyd wyse, all the tonycle shall wex whyte 
and the pacyent shall lese hys sy3te. 
 
Moreouer here wyll I teche yow practysers a crafte to 
[\p. 116\] take out an hawe from the eye be ensample of a cure that I dyd 
oonys yn Tuskayne in a cite callyd Iuk, where was brou3t to me 
a man þat hade an hawe yn hys ey of the smytyng of a whete 
yere ouerthwart, but the nethyr ende appered outwarde on the 
tonycle, and yt appered as it doth when it is on a mannys fynger 
betwene the fleshe and the nayle. And yn thys I dyde thus 
indede proceden: 
 
Ffyrst y avysed me wele and wysely wher the hawe entred, 
and þere sotylly I kut without any trouble of the tonycle. And 
þan hade I rede ij nedyls [\p. 117\] myghtyly knytt togeder by the 
eyon yn maner of a twycch. Of whych oon I put the poynt vnder 
the hawe on the same syde wher yt went yn, and betwene the 
tonycle and the poynt of the toþer nedyl I put aboue the hawe. 
And after that sotylly I streyned them togydder, and so wyth 
softe wyndyng of þat oon honde and sotyll rollyng it wyth the 
oþer honde, I drew oute the hawe. Whych doon, anoon I put 
ynto the eye of the oynement aforesayd callyd virtus a deo data, 
twyes on the day, tyl the tonycle was sowdyd and the ey hoole. 
And þus do [\p. 118\] 3e in lyke wyse yf 3e wyll gett your worschyp 
and your pacyent helth. 
 
It also happeneth sum tyme folkys by the styngyng of sum 
venemous beste yn the eye, as by waspys or attercoppys or ony 
|P_87 
such oþer, or with any infecte ayre that men calle blastyng, 
wherthorugh the ey wexeth so bolnyn that the pacyent may not 
opyn hys eye and the payne growyth so greueous þat he may 
haue no rest. Wherfore when 3e see any such haue the recours 
to the gracyous herbe callyd cardus benedictus, sowthystyl. 
[{[\f. 33\] And these ben the signes to know hem, for he hathe two lyknes in 
herselfe. Firste for it hathe litell leuys and the 2e grete leuys and brode, and 
we sayne that all ben of on complexioun and of one sauour and hauen one 
vertue, and it makethe a citren flour.{] Take þerof an handful and 
stampe it and temper it [\p. 119\] wyth halfe the whyte of an egg, 
and þereof make a plaster wyth coton or flexe herdys, and the 
eye shitt ley it theron and bynd it þereto with a lynnen bend so 
that it remoue nat therfro. And so let it leye tyl it be drye, and 
after þat it is drye ley to another, and so tyl the bolnyng be 
hoole. Thys plaster ys callyd gracious for it swagyth bolnyng 
and yt puttyth awey blode from the eye, it swagyth the peyne 
and dystroyth the venym. And yf it happen sum tyme sodeynly 
that the eye wex rede and sore brennyng, so þat [\p. 120\] 
the pacyent thenk þat hys eye were ful of grauel, with thys 
gracious plaster he shall ben holpen as sone as it is leyd þereon. 
And for thies causes and oþer, thys plaster ys callyd gracious. 
 
Thys þan tau3th by thys autor, Beneuucius, the specyall hurtys 
of eyon boyth inwardly and outwardly caused and the specyall 
cures of the same. Now here yn the laste ende of thys 
booke he techeth generall medycyns, and fyrst he techyth powders 
and after coleryous and fynally he techyth a general dyatorye 
for al maner of such pacyentis. [\p. 121\] 
 
Ffyrst as towchyng powders, I sey to yow in the name of 
Ihesu that powder mayde of the margaryte put yn the eye 
whych hath a clowde lyke a thynne clowde sprede abrode yn the 
clere eyre, hit helpit it. The same doth a jasper powdryd; also yf 
the eye be red or blody, it puttyth it awey. Also cristall sotylly 
powderd doth the same that the jasper doth and also largyth the 
eye. Also a saphire powderd dooth iij thyngys in the eye: it 
|P_88 
fretyth the webbe, it sharpyth the sy3te and constrenyth 
[\p. 122\] the pupyll, and clarifyeth all the eye. And after that it ys onys 
entryde into the eye, it may neuer be apeyred wythout grete 
hurte. Also powder of the berall fretyth away yn the eye 
an[{d{] comfortyth all the humors. But here it ys to be markyd 
þat wyth all thies powders wyth eche of them must be medled 
powder of suger captyu to temper and to restreyne her my3ty 
vyolens, and in thys proporcyon: ij partys ben of suger and oon 
of the oþer powder. And thys powder must be kept yn a boxe of 
gold or of syluer, and twyes in the day [\p. 123\] morn and euyn 
put into the eye. 
 
And not oonly of precyous stonys but also of gommys and of 
oþer thyngys may be made ful holsom powders for eyon. And as 
for g[{u{]mmys take the gomme of olyues and make þereof 
powder, and þat fretyth the webbe and claryfyeth the eye. 
Gomme of fenkyll doth the same and also quykenyth the visible 
spiritys and sharpet the ly3th. Also gumme of bitter almondes 
doth the same. And the bitter plumbes gumme the same. And 
wete 3e wel wheresoeuer the powder of the seid gummes be put 
yn the eyon for the webbe or [\p. 124\] pannyclus, they shall 
helpe and nothyng hurte. 
 
Also take suger candy and washe it wele and wype it wyth a 
lynnen cloth tyl it be drye and þan powder it. Thys powder 
fretyth the webbe and clarifyeth the syght and doyth many oþer 
woonderful thyngys when it is entred into the eye. Also take 
tutie of Alexandre sotyl and grene and powder it and medyl it 
wyth suger captyu, even quantitees. Thys powder restreynyth 
teres and fretyth the webbe, puttyth aweye bolnyng of the eyeledys, 
and distroyth the ycche þereof and the blode [\p. 125\] of the 
eyon. Also take the strenys of egg and medyll them wyth suger 
captyu and bray them togheder in a brasyn morter yn the 
|P_89 
maner of a sawce, and it yn a wesyll of glas and dry it all at the 
son and þan powder it and þerof put yn þine eye in whych ys a 
webbe, and it shall frete it wythoute peyn or violence an[{d{] 
claryfie the sy3te. Also take the dragons roote and scrape awey 
clene the berke and stampe it and wryng out the jus and medyl 
it wyth powder of sarcocolle yn thys maner proporcion: that is 
[\p. 126\] ij scruples of the jows and half an vnce of the powder, 
and drye yt at the son and powder it. And thys ys goode for the 
webe in the eye, [{[\f. 35\] and in many stedis it is cleped mobilion and 
in Cecile and in Calabre and in Poile, pustile. Me fyndeth many suche, 
and ye shull hele þese pacientis first whiles they ben newe and fresshe erly 
and at euen, and these medicynes that ye fynde good and yproued ye shull 
haue hem afore honde. Also sponge marina yclensed from sonde and ybrent 
in a newe potte and make poudre, and it shall freten the clowde and 
blackethe the tonicle and it clerethe the sight.{] 
 
Also an vnce of spyce callyd lignum aloes, and bren it 
betwene ij bassyns so that the smoke goo not out. Whych 
doone, than take 1 vnce of suger captyu and stampe it in the 
ouer bassyn wyth the smoke and make a powder of them both. 
After thys stampe the brend lignum aloes in the same basyn þat 
it was brend yn, and medyll þerewyth a drame of goode muske 
and iiij dramys of amber wele smellyng. Than put [\p. 127\] both 
powders yn on basyn and make of all oon sotyl powder. This 
powder fretyth the forseyd clowde and clarifyeth the sy3te and 
comforteth the vysible spirit and restrenyth teres causyd of cold 
humors and comforteth the brayn, lyftyng vp the eyledys, and 
dystroyth the peyn of the mygreym. [{[\f. 35\] But wyseliche dothe 
that noo asshes falle into the bacyn noþer [\f. 35v\] coles, and all shalt thou 
poudry and kepe it in a boiste of siluer.{] 
 
Also the gall of a beste callyd castor medled with the juys of 
an herbe clepyd morsus galline of whych herbe be ij spyces: oon 
beryth a rede floure the oþer a violet floure. That whych beryth 
|P_90 
the rede floure ys callyd domina, the oþer [\p. 128\] ancilla; and 
notwythstondyng this diuersytee of floures, þei ben both of oon 
complexion and of oon sauor and of oon similitude, saue þat 
floure. Take the jous of thys herbe and put yn the thyrde proporcion 
and medyl it togheder and so myche of the powder of 
sarcacolle that yt be as sade as past; þan dry it at the son. Than 
powder it ageyn and medyll it wyth suger captyu, for it is 
vyole[{n{]t. 
 
Also take the galle of a bere and medyll it wyth the powder of 
margarytys and drye them at the soon. Than powder it [\p. 129\] 
ageyn, and loke þer be ij partys of galle and oon of powder. Also 
take the galle of an eglee and yncorporate þerwyth the powder 
of iaspe and drye it yn the son. Than m[{e{]dyl it wyth the 
powder of suger captyu so that ij partys be suger and oon of 
galle and of the jaspe. [{[\f. 36\] It shall frete the clowde and caust oute 
blode, and it shall allight and swagen the greuance of the ey3eliddes.{] 
 
Also the oyle of olyfe put ynto the ey meruelusly fretyth the 
webbe or clowde, but it ys ry3te vyolent. Wherfore at euyn 
when 3e put the oyle yn the eye, ley aboue the plaster þat is 
callyd emplastrum laudabile to temper the vyolens of the oyle. 
Also jowus [\p. 130\] of a sowre crape. Take xxti crapes ere they 
be rype, confecte them wyth oure powder callyd Alexander yn 
the maner of a past and drye it in the sone and powder it a3en 
and medle it wyth the powder of suger captyu, dowble to the 
oþer powder. Thys fretyth myghtely the sayd clowde and dystroyeth 
the rednes of the eyeledys and claryfyeth the sy3te. 
 
Now after the doctryne of powders the autor techith dyuers 
colories for diuers sekenes that fallyth yn the eyeledys and letten 
the sy3te and wasten the [\p. 131\] tonycle and lette the pacyent to 
haue hys rest. And fyrst ayen rednes of the eyelyddys: take totye 
of Alexander and of amatist stone, sandragon, reed corall, good 
|P_91 
aloes, epatik euyn porcioun of eche halfe an vnce; sarcacolle, 
spykenard, safron of eche a drame; suger candy an vnce; camphir, 
mirrus, olibani, mastyk of eche halfe a drame; the rootys 
of parcely, fenel, and wormode of eche halfe an hanful. Breke all 
thyes thyngys togydder yn a morter and after put them yn a feyr 
basyn and temper þem wyth iij [\p. 132\] pyntys of good whyte 
wyne and after put yt yn an erthen pott, boylle it togheder wyth 
a softe fyre tyll the wyne be halfe wasted. Then clense it 
thorugth a lynnen cloth and kepe it yn glasse and put þerof yn 
the pacyentys eye morn and eve tyll it be hoole. 
 
Also a3en the seyd sekenes of the eyledys and the rednes 
therof: take totye of Alexander halfe an vnce; of antemonie, 
erys vsti, suger captyu of eche an vnce and an halfe; and roses 
dryed as muche. All thyes thyngys, saue roses pouderd, put yn 
a erthen pote wythe [\p. 133\] iij pyntys of whyte wyne boyllyng 
wyth soft fyre tyll halfe be wastede and vse thys as the oþer 
beforn. 
 
Also anoþer colerie for the same: take an vnce of totye Alexandre 
and xl croppys of bremel and stampe them toghedyr as it 
were sawce with iij pyntys of whyte wyne yn a new erthen potte. 
Boyle it togheder to the halfe and vse it as the toþer. Thies 
forseyd coleryes byth moyst preuyd for the seyd sekenes of the 
eyeledys, but they arn not good for the webbe yn the eye but 
raþer n[{o{]yous, for wyne ys constriktyfe [\p. 134\] and confyrmatyffe. 
And þerfore yf colerie be made wyth wyne and be put 
yn the eye that hath a webbe, the pacyent shall neuer be hoole 
nor holpyn þerewyth but rather appayred. 
 
Also take totye and sarcacolle of eche halfe an vnce; roses 
sedys ij vnces; camphyr ij drammys. Pouder thyes togheder and 
boyll them in a quarte of whyte wyne to the thyrd parte, and put 
ij dropys yn the sore eye and it wyll put awey rednes of the eyon 
and restreyne teres. Also a3en watrye eyon: yff the pacyent 
|P_92 
drynk [\p. 135\] erely fastyng auream Alexandrinam wyth wyne, 
streyneth teres maruelously. Also medyll sarcacolle wyth womans 
mylke and dry it at the son and eftsones do the same, and 
than powder it and put it yn the eye whych is dusty or mysty. It 
cleryth well the sy3th. 
 
Now fynally drawyng to the ende of thys booke, Benuenucius 
spekyth to hys dysciplis concludyng thus: O 3e my dyscyples 
whych wyll be practysers yn cures off sore eyon, lyke as 3e haue 
herde me teche, [\p. 136\] so werke. And pray 
god wyth laude and thankyng þat he wyll wytsayff of his specyall 
grace to performe your cures to hys worshype and your 
pacyentys helth. And alwey haue awarenes in your cures to 
mesurable dyet of your pacyentys and to kepe them from contraryous 
metys tyll þei recouere perfy3te helth. That ys to wyt 
froo beef, gootys flech salted, from stoke fysshe, from elys, from 
onyons, from garlyk, from commenyng of women, from bathes, 
from sawcys, from grete werynes, from grete [\p. 137\] labour, 
from ouer myche wacche and fastyng. Lete hym not goo 
abroode yn the wynde nor yn the soon, nor loke yn no lanterne 
ly3te tyll they be recouered. Lete them ete rere egges wyth 
breed; yff þei be yong, lete them drynk water; and yff they be 
olde, lete them drynk wyne with water. And yff the cure tarye 
þat nature helpe not, yeve them fleshe of yong gootys gelded, 
soden and not rooste, tyll they be recouerede. 
 
Deo gracias.
