Be a leche wele puruied þat he haue a couenable 
instrument for clistrye3 to be ministred; þat is þat he haue a 
pipe of tree, namely of box, or of hesel þat availeþ mych, 
or of salowe, to þe length of 6 ynche3 or 7 with on hole 
alon; ffor old men vsed pipes holed in þe side. Bot witte 
þou for certayne þat, as I haue lered be experience, a pipe 
with one holo availeþ more, and 3etteþ better in þe 
|P_75 
liquore. Afterward haue he a swyne3 bledder, or a 
nete3 bledder, no3t blowne to myche, which þou schalt 
preparate þus for to be kept. Take þe forseid swyne3 or 
nete3 bladder when it is dry, and putte þerin a sponeful of 
comon salt, of water als mych, of hony als mych as of 
watre; latte þam be dissolued togidre in þe bledder by 
tuo daies naturale, And euery day tuyes or þries be þe 
bledder turned or shaken about, þat it may be wette of 
þe liquore on euery side. Afterward be þat putte out 
þat is þer-in, and be þe bledder blowne, and be þe 
mouth bonden þat þe wynde go no3t out, and hyng it in 
ane vmbrose place vnto þat þer be had nede þer-of. 
Þis preparacion, forsoþ, kepeþ þe bledder fro corrupcion 
long tyme, And fro fretyng of worme3, and makeþ þe 
bladder strong and able to þe vse of the forseid werk. 
Be þe clistrye made þer after my maner, for it is li3t bot 
no3t lesse effectuale. Many þings bene profitable to þe 
confeccion of clisteries, if þe lech mi3t haue al redy. Bot 
oft-tyme þe leche may no3t fynde in euery place al þing3 
necessary to hym; þerfor it schal no3t vnworschip a lech 
for to spede profitabily with fewer þings and li3ter. Old 
leche3, forsoþ, ordeyned costiuous clystrye3, greuous and 
li3t, and þai putte in cassiam fistulam, mirobalan, rerepigre 
and oþer laxatiue3; which clisterie3, forsoþ, after þair 
receyuyng, made þe paciente3 more constipate, i.[{e.{] encostyued, 
þan þai war before; And þerfor long tyme3 and 
oft tyme3 I haue proued and bene experte a li3ter maner 
of clystrying and more effectuous, as wele in childre and 
wymmen as in men, als wele in 3ong men as in olde men; 
And in diuerse case3 as in wounded men, constipate men, 
and febrous men, and in colica & yliaca. And I spedde 
effectuously with sich a clistre þat is þer made. Recipe 
malue3 comon and grene camamille, or drye if þou may 
haue it, and brisse þam a litel, and sethe þam in watre 
vnto þe watre become grene; þan tak whete branne als 
myche as sufficeþ, and putte it to þe forseid herbis and 
boile it a litel; afterward cole it, and to þe colyng adde to 
ane handful of salt and clene hony or oile; and be al wele 
|P_76 
resolued, mouyng it with a spature or with þi hande; þis 
confection, forsoþ, may be kept by a fourtni3t if it be 
nede. If malue3, forsoþ, or camamille may no3t be 
hadde, with water & branne and salt without any oþer 
þing þe forseid nede schall be sped wele yno3 for certayn. 
ffor whi; for certayne if a lech wanted all oþer þing3, 
with water alon & salt boiled togidre and 3ette in by a 
clistrye bringeþ out squiballe3. 

[\f. 164v\] Bot witte þou þat þise bene necessary to þe confeccion 
of clistrie3, þat is to sey, Hony, oile, butter, salt, swyne3 
grese, sope white and blak, oile of camamill, oile of rwe, 
& oile of malue3, sanguis veneris, & c. Of which forseid 
white sope may euer more be necessary to a leche, for it 
y-putte in þe forseid decoccione and þer schaken wele 
with þe hande mych strengtheþ þe clistrye; and þis may 
euer more be had redy. Also hony when it may be hadde 
doþe grete help in euery clistery. Þise bene herbe3 
necessary to þe werk of clistry, scilicet Violette, malue3, 
camamill, mercurialis, watercresse, caule lefe3, peritorie, 
& c. Of which som wircheþ mollifying, as malue3; some 
dissoluyng, as camamill, peritorie, and oþer. Bot wytte 
þou þat in clistrying þe leche owe for to augmente and 
lessen þe proporcion of salt after þat þe vertu of þe pacient 
may thole, i.[{e.{] suffre, for þe tendernes of longaon, and 
after þat he seþe þe pacient strong, softe or hard for to 
avoiden. ffor grete quantite of salt makeþ sone þe clistery 
for to haste to þe goyng out, And mene quantite bryngeþ 
no3t out so sone. Þerfor be þe lech waker in þis þat he 
be no3t negligent ne fole-hardy in his wirchyng. ffor it is 
werk of a perfite maistrye. ffor þe which I haue geten ane 
hundreþ tyme3 grete honour with lucre in diuerse place3. 
ffor whi; at london when lumbarde3 of-tyme3 ministred 
clisterie3 on þair maner to colic men and oþer men constipate, 
ne my3t no3t availe, I, forsoþ, with þe forseid 
maner of clistriyng, at þe first tyme within þe space of a 
forlong or of tuo, I deliuered þe pacient for certayne, our 
lord beyng mene. When þou wilt forsoþ giffe a clistre, 
Tak of þe forseid decoccion half a quart at þe moste and 
putte it in þe bladder, and putte þe gretter ende of þe 
|P_77 
pipe into þe bladder, and bynde it faste; and anoynte þe 
forþer end of þe pipe with fresch swyne3 grese, or with 
butter, or with popilion, or with comon oile, or with hony. 
And putte in þi fynger, anoynted first with some of þe 
forseid þings, into þe lure; And alsone putte in þe pipe of 
þe clistre into þe lure. And þan ow þe leche for to presse 
þe bladder with þe liquore atuix his honde3 and 3ette in 
þe liquore. And if he fynde as it war ane obstacle in 3e 
wombe lettyng þe entryng of þe liquore, as it oftyme3 
falle3, þan draw agayne a litel þe pipe, and he schal fele 
þe liquore entre, and þan 3ette in al þe liquore; which 
y-3ette in, make he þe pacient for to lye grouelyng aboue 
his bedde, and frote & robbe his wombe vpon þe nauyl 
with his owne hand or with anoþer manne3; [\f. 165r\] And enforce 
he hymself als long as he may for to withhold þe clisterye, 
And when he may no longer hold it, go he to a sege 
made redy with a basyne standyng vnder-neþe and þer do 
his nede3. And se þe lech þe egestions, wheþer it be blode 
or putride flemme &c, or wormes or squiballe3 indurate, 
or wheþer colre go out or quiter &c. And þus may þe 
leche be certified what is to do in euery cure. Ouer 
þat þis is namely to be written, þat when þe lech ministreþ 
clistery to any man, þat in 3ettyng in þe liquore with þe 
clistery þe liquor alsone stirt out vpon þe hande3 of þe 
leche, so þat þe pacient may no3t withhold it ne receyue 
it; and þat dure 2 daies or 3, for certayne sich a pacient 
is disposed to þe deþ without dout, þat is if þe liquor 
3etted in be no3t ouer scharp of þe salt. Þerfor be þe 
leche circumspecte, for ful seldom haue I sene þis reule 
faile for certayn, bot neþerlesse it holdeþ no3t euer, þat is 
if þe sekene3 go agayne to wele-fare. Also it is to 
witte þat when þe leche haþe wele clensed, bi þe clistery, þe 
wombe of fece3 and oþer superfluite3 seid afore, þan profiteþ 
it mych for to 3ette in a clistery made of decoccione 
of malue3, if it may be hadde, and of branne and of butter 
& oile or swyne3 grece. If malue3, forsoþ, may no3t be 
had, þan be it made only of decoccion of branne and of 
þe toþer seid aboue, and be it 3etted in by þe clistery. 
|P_78 
Be þis clistery forsoþe made without any salt, And þan 
owe þe pacient for to withhold it strongly by al a ni3t and 
longer. And þis schall conforte þe bowelle3 and schal mollifien 
þam, and schal kepe þam fro constreynyng vnto þai 
be filled with new fece3. Elle3, forsoþ, of þe voidene3 of 
þe bowelle3 þe bowelle3 schuld be constipate, as I haue oft 
tyme sene. It is to witte þat in curacione of þe colic 
no medicyne so sone helpeþ as clistery; ffor why; þis 
bryngeþ out hard squiballe3 of what euery cause þai be 
withholden, And it avoideþ soueranly ventosene3, and 
wonderfully putteþ out viscose flemne & putrified. Wherfor 
I haue oft-tyme3 cured many paciente3 with clistery 
without any oþer medicyne, And oft-tyme3 within 3 houre3. 
And þerfor it spedeþ for to wirk first with a clistre in 
colic & yliaca passions; ffor þe lower bowelle3 avoided of 
þair superfluite3, þe ouer bowelle3 may more li3tly putte 
out fro þam þair superfluite3 to þe lawer bowelle3. As 
auicen seiþ, al þe bowelle3 of a mannes wombe ar continued 
with venis miseraicis, out-take longaon, for longaon 
is no3t continued to þam. Wherfor þe lyuer may drawe 
to hym fro ouer bowell somwhat, And by þis is it 
schewed þat if ane hole man bi any case be distitute 
of appetite of [\f. 165v\] mete and drynk, þat he may no maner 
ete, þat by þe infusion into þe lure by a clistrye of any 
norischyng liquore, as of any potage or mylke of almande3 
or sich oþer, þe lyuer mygth draw þerof to hymself and 
so norisch þe body. Þerfor witte þou þat clisterie3 no3t 
only availeþ to seke men and constipate, as of þe colic or 
of sich oþer, bot it availeþ to al men beyng in þe febre3, 
als wele acue3 as crenic, i.[{e.{] long tyme lastyng, And to 
euery inflacion of þe wombe, and to ventosite of it, and 
torcions, i.[{e.{] gryndyng. And som-tyme it availeþ mych 
in som fluxe3 of þe wombe; And for certayn it availeþ 
mich to hole men, constipate and no3t constipate, if þai 
be purged twyse at lest or 3 or four tyme3 in a 3ere with þe 
forseid clisterie3; þat is tuyse in wynter, and in vere as it 
war after lentyn one3, in somer one3, or ofter tyme if nede 
be. ffor why; þe benefite of it may no man noumbre; 
ffor as it helpeþ fair in necessite, be it preserueþ þam þat vseþ 
it fro harme & necessite: be it þerfor had in reuerence. 

|P_79 
[\f. 166r\] 19. [{O{]f atramente3, i.[{e.{] of vitriole3, bene many 
kynde3; And þat is better þat is more grene and þat is 
founden in þe yle of Crete; and it is called comonly dragante, 
bot no3t dragagante, ffor dragagant is a white gumme 
and clere like vnto gumme arabic. Also þer is a spice of 
vitriol þat is called vitriolum romanum, i.[{e.{] coporose; 
And it is of 3alow colour in reward of þe grenner vitriol. 
And þer is one of white colour bot no3t schynyng, and 
þat is seid to availe to þe cure3 of ei3en. Vitriol is hote 
and drye in þe 4 degre after platear, And þer ar 4 
maners þerof: Indicum, þat is founden in ynde, and þat 
is white; Arabicum þat is founden in arabye, and þat is 
3elow; And ciprinum þat is founden in Cipre, and þat 
is grene; And romanum þat is coprose, þat is more grene 
is competent to medicyne. It haþe strenght of dissoluyng, 
consumyng, fretyng. It may be kepte by 10 3ere effectualy. 
Also vitriol combuste be itself or with salt combuste 
vputte vpon a venemyd wonde draweþ þe venym 
fro byneþ vnto aboue. Also puluer of vitriol combuste 
streyneþ blode in euery place if it be putte by itself or 
with iuyse of any herbe streynyng blode, as of rede 
netle, or bursa pastoris, or moleyne, or walwort. Also it 
is seid to availe agayns polipe in þe nose if it be putte 
into þe nose with a tente of coton and melle rosette medled 
with 3olk of an ey; it freteþ superflue flesch, and putte 
into a fistule mortifieþ it. And also it y-medled with 
 diaquilon or apostolicon and y-put vpon on fraudulent vlcere3 
in dry membre3, it cureþ þam meruelously in drawyng, 
and mortifieþ þam and freteþ þam. Also if vitriol be 
combust it is lesse mordicatyue, but his dryne3 is not 
lessened. fforsoþ al spice3 of vitriol bene scharp after 
lesse and more, and þai haue þair scharpne3 in þair superficite; 
And when þai ar combuste þai bene exsiccatyue 
without grete mordicacion, and so in exsiccand þai gendre 
flesch, and most in drye membris and bodie3. ffor why; 
Vitriol y-put to diuerse membris or diuerse membris it is 
sene to haue diuerse effecte In dry bodie3, for as coloric 
|P_80 
and malencolious; And also putte in dry membre3 when 
it fyndeþ strong membre3 agaynstayndyng to his strenght, 
þan may he no3t bot dry superfluite3 y-founden in vlcere3 
or in wonde3; which forsoþ y-dried, nature gendereþ flesch. 
In moist bodie3, forsoþe, as in fleumatike men and childre 
and wymmen, and in moiste membre3 of þe bodie, þe 
membre3 bene feble and may no3t withstande to þe strength 
of þe vitriol; and so þai suffre liquefaccion of it, and so 
putrefaccion is augmented in þe wonde. And as it wirkeþ 
þus in diuerse bodie3, so wirkeþ it in diuerse complexions 
and diuerse membris. And it doþe no3t þus for contrariouste 
of operacion þat it haþe in itself, bot for 
contrariouste of complexions to which it is y-putte; As 
fire doþ diuersely in dyuerse þings. ffor whi; lede or 
oþer metalle as bras and siluer y-put to þe fire ar molten 
of þe fire; tyle, stone3, and erþen potte3 y-putte to þe fire 
ar hardened; and þise be no3t done for þat þe fire haþe 
contrarious wirkyng in hymself, bot for contrariouste of 
nature of þe forseid þin3. [\f. 166v\] Wherfor seiþ galiene, if þer 
be tuo þings euen in helþe, and þe tone be in a dry 
membre and þe toþer in a moiste, þat þat is in þe dry 
membre nedeþ more dry medycyne. Emplastre3, forsoþ, 
þat ar putte to membre3 owen to be of o kynd to þe 
membrys, after Iohn Damascene: Tak of vitriol als 
mych as þou wilt, i.[{e.{] 2 vnce3 or 3 or 4, and putte 
in ane erþen potte whos mouþe be wele stopped with clay 
distemperate with horse dong, þat is called lutum sapien 
and sette it to dry; þe which y-dried, sette þe potte with 
þe vitriol among cole3, and make a softe fire by one houre; 
And after ane houre make it stronger, and blow strongly 
with belowe3 2 houre3, and after lette in pece vnto þat þe 
fire defaile by itself. And þe potte y-colded, be it opned, 
and þou schalt fynde attrament, i.[{e.{] vitriol, of rede 
colour cleuyng to þe side3 of þe potte; whiche remoued 
fro þe potte, be it poudred subtily vpon a stone, and putte 
it in a strong leþer bagge and kepe it to þine vse. By sich 
combustion is his natural hete alterate aud so it is colded, 
and so his mordicacion is dulled; wherfor it may restreyne 
blode in nose3 and wounde3 and lure and marice. Also it 
|P_81 
availeþ agayne3 þe cancre and agayn3 venemous aposteme3 
and fraudulente3; And to teþe or gome3 freten or gnawen 
medled with symple hony, or better with melle rosate; Or 
best if þat licium, i.[{e.{] iuyse of caprifoile with clarefied 
hony be soþen to þe þikne3 of hony, and be medled with 
puluer of vitriol and putte vnto þe gome3; ffor whi; 
Iuyse of caprifoile þat is called licium availeþ bi itself to 
al þe vice3 of þe mouþe. Also vitriol y-medled with hony 
and licium putte þer-in helpeþ to vlcere3 of ere3, and to 
þe quitour of þam and fretyng. Also vitriol combuste 
when it is medled with puluer of hermodactile3 and putte 
vnder-neþ þe tung it helpeþ to þe ranule. & Ane oyntment 
þat availeþ to cancrose vlcere3, and to wonde3, and to 
aposteme3, of which floweþ out blode, and to yuel carbuncle3 
þat ar called pestilenciale3, and to aposteme3 þat 
ar made of yuel mater, is made þus: Recipe of old swyne 
grese +o iii, vitriol +o iiii. Be þe grese molten ouer þe fire & 
be it coled, and breke long tyme þe vitriol with oile in a 
brazen morter, and afterward medled with þe grese ouer þe 
fire, and make ane oyntement mych fruyteful. If þou 
wilt make it in maner of one emplastre, putte þer-to wax 
and blak pich, for pich haþe strenght or vertu of drawyng 
fro partie3 bineþ to aboue, and þe same doþe vitriol. 

20. Alum 3ucaryne is called comonly alumglasse. It 
is hote and dry in þe 4 degre. It is a 
veyne of þe erþe y-knowen yno3, bot how mych it is more 
clere & schynyng so mych is it better. It haþe strenght of 
consumyng and of gretly desickyng. It availeþ with hote 
vinegre agayn3 inflacions of þe gome3; And it availeþ in 
medicyne3 agayn3 þe scabbe. Also poudre of it combuste 
profiteþ mich bi itself, or y-medled with hony, [\f. 167r\] in mundifying 
of li3t cure3. It mundifieth, forsoþ, with a stiptikne3 
and in þat þat it is stiptik it is confortatyue of membre3, 
for al stiptik þing3 bene repressiue of humours. Þer is, 
forsoþe, anoþer kynde of alum þat is called alumen scissum, 
comonly alum plume, and it haþe þrede3 and it may be 
diuided and ryuen in sondre. And it is ri3t gode, and it 
haþe þe same vertue3 as alum glasse. Alum glasse is 
|P_82 
brynt þus: Tak a tile stone or a scarþe of a potte, and 
putte it in þe midde3 of brynnyng cole3 so þat þe cole3 
touch it no3t, and in þat scarþe putte þe hole pece of alum, 
and alsone it will melt as it war yse, and boile, and afterward 
it wexeþ hard; and in boilyng it will blow and wex 
hi3e in drying and wexing white. And lat it be stille so 
in þe fire vnto þe blowyng and boilyng vtterly cese, and 
to it be bro3t into ful white colour; þe which y-sene, sette 
it fro þe fire and poudre it ful smal vpon a stone, and in a 
leþer bag kepe it to þine vse. Water of alum is made þus: 
Tak a quantite of it als mich as þou wilt, and breke it at 
þe best, to which be added to 8 partie3 of gode vinegre 
and strong, and so boile þam in a panne at þe fire vnto þat 
þe half parte of al-togidre be consumed. Afterward	 
remoue it fro þe fire and cole it; And þis is called watre 
of alum, which availeþ agayn3 ychyng of scabbe of salt 
flemne. And þis watre mundifieþ in coldand, bot watre 
of sulphur mundifieþ in hetyng or chaufand. 

21. Viride es i.[{e.{] vertgre3, is hote and drye. It is ful 
penetratyue and dissolutyue, and it prikkeþ and brynneþ 
and melteþ, and repressiþ putrefaccion. Wharfor, after 
galiene, [{cap.{] 4 de ingenio, of wex and oile and vertgrese 
may be made anoyntement temperato. ffor whi; vertegrese 
is ful mich penetratife, dissolutiue, pungityue, vrityue, 
and liquefactyue. And al þise ar repressed and dulled of

22. [{A{]rsenic & auripigment bene boþe one, bot 
arsenic is no3t so fair as auripigment; neþerlesse 
boþe haue a 3alow colour, but auripigment is gretter 
and more schynyng, and more disesy for to grynde for his 
þredine3; for in substance he is like vnto plaistre of paris. 
Bot arsenic is as it war puluer in reward of auripigment, 
and it is more li3tly broken; And when it is broken it 
haþe as it war vermilion within it, of rede colour and of 
a3our colour; which vnkunnyng men saiþ to be realgre, & 
|P_83 
þat is falce. ffor whi; realgre is ane artificial confection 
made of alkenemistre3 bi sublimacion, as arsenic sublimed, 
And for certayn þai ar no3t different in operacion in any 
þing, out-take þat realgre is of rede colour, and arsenic 
sublimed is of white colour; bot neþerle3 arsenic entreþ in 
confeccion of realgre, And forþi realgre is called of som

It is forsoþ dissolutyue, attractyue, and mundificatyue, 
And it haþe in it a vertue putrefactyue by which

or ane vlcere, þat þai may no3t be assimilate, i.[{e.{] 
liken to membre3, and engendre superflue flesch or dede 
flesch. Also it availeþ in medicyne3 agayn3 þe scabbe, þe 
tetre and white morfee y-medled with blak sope. And 
for þat we made mencion of arsenic sublimed, þerfor it is 
to witte þat no leche bot if he be more experte in cirurgie 
presume for to wirk with realgre or arsenic sublimed. ffor 
of þam ar bredde many disese3 for þair distemperate 
violence. ffor why; þai boþe wirk with one maner and 
violence, and þat more violently þan cautery of fire. And 
if any man ow for to vse þam, þam owe to be putte to in

þou þat auripigment is desiccatyue, consumptiue, euaporatyue, 
eradicatyue, putrefactiue, ruptyue and cauteriatyue. 
Also witte þou þat of arsenie sublimed or of realgre, þat 
one3 in a tyme in þe bigynnyng of my practi3ing, when I

þrid daie, forsoþe, þe place wher þe puluer was putte 
appered of ri3t blak colour, and þe paciente3 war so feble 
|P_84 
þat þai war almost dede. Þan I anoynted þair legge3 with 
oile of rose or popilion, And I fomented þe leggis in 
hote water for to euapour yuel humours contened in þe

þinne, with oile of rose. Aboue þe larde putte I ane 
emplastre of þe 3olkes of raw egge3, And stuppe3 of lyne 
aboue for to hold þe larde. And aboute þe 9 daie þe place 
combuste beganne to dissolue in þe circumference and for 
to putte out quiter. And þe place no3t reparate bot fro 
þe þrid day to þe þrid daye I continued euer-more þis cure	 
in þe forseid maner, vnto þat al þe mortified flesch within 
was fully putte out þe which, forsoþ, putte out, þe bone of 
þe legge appered bare with a wounde ri3t horrible; þe 
which y-sene, I filled þe wonde of stupe3 y-kitte smalle, 
and putte þam aboue þe naked bone; and I putte in of þe 
3olk of a raw egg wele temperate with sanguine veneris, 
and I filled al þe wounde þer-with; and so euery day one3 
reparalyng it vnto þe quiter biganne to cese, and þe side3 
of þe wounde byganne for to sonde or conglutinate. And 
witte þou þat when þe side3 of þe wounde come to þe

þe ignorance of þe comon puple, euery day I schoue þe 
bare bone with instrument preparate þer-to, entendyng 
for to gendre flesch vpon þe bare bone. And I putte to

schauying euery day continued in þe maner of ydiote3, 
as I seid afore; a daye, as I schoue þe forseid bone, þe 
bare bone vnder þe instrument moued vp and downe; 
þat, forsoþ, perceyued, I meruailed ouer mesure, neþerle3 
I perceyued of þat þat þe scbauyng of þe bone profited 
noþing: fro þan forþe I lefte þat werk, and I putte noþing 
elle3 in þe wounde bot licium with melle rosate and 3olk 
of a raw aye ymedled togidre, with carped stupe3 of lyne, 
and so fro day to day continuyng vnto þe forseid bone, 
|P_85 
flesch growyng vnder-neþe appered hi3er þan þe extremite3 
of þe wounde, and was made more moueable and more; 
þe which ysene, I putte þe poynt of a knyfe vnder þe side 
of þe bone and I raised it a litel, and al þe bare bone stirt 
out, and rede flesch had filled al þe space where þe bone 
laye, and blode went out. Þat bone, forsoþe, had in length 
4 ynche3, and 2 in brede; in þikne3, forsoþe, it was drawne 
out almost vnto þe merewgh of þe bone; And þis was in 
þe schyne bone. After þe seperacion, forsoþe, of þe bone, 
I cured finaly þe wounde with licium and mel rosate and 
raw 3olk of an ey and puluer sine pari. And þe pacient 
recouered wonderfully his goyng; he was, forsoþe, a 3ong 
man. And as it fell on þe tone man, one þe same maner 
felle it of þe toþer. And witte þou þat I putte no3t of 
puluer of arsenic in þe legge3 of þe forseid men ouer þe 
quantite of a corne of senvey, and neþerlesse þe wonde3 
þat come of þe arsenic passed fully þe lengthe and þe brede 
of a manne3 hande. Þerfor vnexperte men be wele war

And þis availeþ to þe cancre in þe mouþe, and in þe lure,

watred with gode white wyne or rede, and þan may þe

owe no3t to be waschen with watre afore þe brissyng, 
and moste when þer owe to be made licium to cure3 of þe

þis proued I in þe legge of a grete man hauyng a pustle, 
In curyng of which al medicyne3 defailed; and with þis

þou þat þis puluis bigileþ neuer þe paciente ne þe cirurgene, 
for it doþ not wickedly. ffor whi; if þe cirurgene bene 
vnkunnyng and putte þis puluis in a wonde or in ane

þe wonde; bot neþerlesse no3t without mordicacion. ffor, 
for certayne, if þis puluis war no3t mordicatyue it schuld

when þis puluis is putte in a wounde or in ane vlcere, be

and so latte it be wiþout remouyng by two nyghte3. [\f. 169r\] After 
þis tyme, forsoþ, when þou remoue3 þe emplastre and þe 
coton or þe stupe3 putte aboue þe puluis, If þe puluis

replete with flesch. And if, forsoþ, in þe first

And aboue al-togidre þe emplastre Nerbone; and so lat 
it abyde by a naturale day or more after þe estimacion of 
þe discrete leche. And when þe dede flesch goþ out of þe 
vlcere or of þe wounde, be it reparailed as it was seid afore. 
And to a leche be þis a reule, þat puluis corrosyue be 
neuer remoued in a wonde or ane vlcere byfor þat it wille 
wilfully go out. Also þer is anoþer reule in which I haue 
sene erre in my tyme almost al men no3t practi3ours bot 
fole3; þat is to say of þe ofte remouyng of wounde3 or 
vlcere3. Siche operacion, for-soþe, spedeþ no3t, bot letteþ 
couenable effecte of curyng. And þat by þis reson, for 
natural hete in þe body, which is principal actour of 
curyng, expireþ out of ofte remeuyng of a wounde or of 
ane vlcere, and so is letted digestion of humours comyng 
to þe wounde or to þe vlcere, Wherfor þer may no3t be 
nade generacion of quitour and, by sewyng, ne purgyng 
of þe wounde. Wherfor superflue humours rennyng to þe 
wounde ar gedred togidre and ar holden stil more and 
more; wherfor þe bolnyng in þe wounde is augmented 
|P_88 
and, by sewyng, þe ake; for þe tone is occasion of þe toþer. 
Wherfor þe wounde or þe vlcere waxep hard and foule, 
and for þe quitour þat it owed of ri3t to putte out, it 
sendeþ out watry humour & venemous, and so ofte-tyme3 
of li3t hurtyng ar made incurable yuele3. Also þer is 
anoþer errour in ofte remeuyng of wounde3 or of vlcere3; 
ffor as seiþ philosophre3, aier chaungeþ þe body and by 
consequens þe wounde, and þat may be proued by experience. 
Þe breþ of a menstruous woman noyeþ vnto 
wounde3 if sche ne3en nere; Or of þe lech if he haue 
liggen with his wife or with anoþer woman menstruate, or 
if he haue eten garleke or onyons. Bot be þis maner of 
wirchyng boldly holden, þat a lech be content only of ane 
reparacione in þe day, þat is if he haue þe medicyne3 
contened in þis boke. ffor when he seþe a wounde or ane 
vlcere wele cast out quitour, and þe bolnyng for to vanysh 
away, and þe akyng for to be cesed, and þe membre for 
to come agayne to þe first habite and colour, helþe is 
at þe dore if þe pacient be we[{le{] gouerned, i.[{e.{] if he 
slepe wele in ni3tes. In slepe, forsoþ, nature wirkeþ 
better aboute digestion of euery mater beyng in þe 
body or in þe membris. Bot for þat slepe is oftyme 
letted of akyng, þerfor bifore al þing3 be it laboured 
þat þe akyng be cessed. [\f. 169v\] ffor akyng3 afor al oþer þings 
no3t only presseþ downe vertue3 of þe body but also of þe 
medicyne3. And þat þing soueranly mitigateþ oile of rose 
in hote cause, or oile of camamille in cold cause, for it 
is hote and resolutyue, of which it schal be seid afterward. 
Also ane emplastre of hony and branne and a litil 
vinegre fried togidre mitigateþ euery akyng for certayne. 
And witte þou þat þo þing3 þat ar putte aboue makeþ to þe 
closyng-in of naturale hete and excludyng of þe aier. Be 
þise þing3 seid afore of remeuyng of wounde3 and vlcere3 
comended wele to mynde; And be it done boldly as it is 
seid, ffor oftyme3 in many case3 I was no3t wount for to 
remoue bot fro þe þrid day into þe þrid day, and þat 
namely in hurtyng of þe schynne3; and I sped wele, And I 
cured many hard þing3 and forsaken of oþer men with þis 
puluis sine pari and oþer emplastre3 y-named. And I 
|P_89 
saw neuer in al my tyme þis forseid puluis defaile, outtake

25.[{A{]nd for þat many men couaiteþ for to here 
name3 of oile3 and of emplastre3 and of oyntement3, 
þerfor I haue putte þair name3 to þam. One for 
þe rednes and swetne3 is called sanguis veneris. Of 
french, forsoþ, for ladie3 is called sank damours or sank de 
pucell, ffor why; venus was called godde3 of luffe. 
Sanguis veneris ow þus to be made: Recipe puluis of 
alcannet +o i. and putte it in a quart of comon oile, and þe 
oile schal become rede to likne3 of blode, wheþer it be 
boiled at þe fire or no3t, for it may be made on boþe 
maners; and be it kept to vse in ane erþen potte or a 
pewdre potte. Þis maner of confeccion of sanguis veneris 
is ri3t gode for þe alkenet þat is cold and drye in þe first 
or second gre. ffor þis alkenet consumeþ humidite3 of 
wounde3 and of vlcere3, for it is subtiliatyue and resolutyue 
without mordicacion, and carminatyue & appertyue, 
and exsiccatyue with stiptikne3. Wherfor it is gode in 
hote aposteme3 with litel mater in þe bygynnyng, for it is 
cold and drye and þerfor it is repercussyue and exsiccatyue 
of hote aposteme3. Also it helpeþ to synues and iuncture3, 
and vlcere3 of þe mouþe in drying. And it medled with 
vinegre & ynoynted helpeþ to þe akyng of þe heued. Sanguis 
veneris heleþ wele, and purgeþ, and defendeþ fro drede 
depe wounde3 made wyth knyfe or arow, and holow vlcere3, 
if it be putte in with stuppe3 of lyne, And emplastre 
Nerbone putte aboue, And it doþe al þing3 þat perteneþ to 
cure of a wounde or of aposteme, and þat in a fair maner. 

[\f. 170r\] Bot witte þou þat Sanguis veneris may be made on 
anoþer maner, and þat to noble men, if þe lech may haue 
in tyme of his confection al þings necessarye vnto his 
confection, þat is to sey þe blode of a maiden virgyne or 
of a maiden damisel about 19 or 20 3ere, which was neuer

When þou wilt, forsoþe, vse þerof, tak a party of it or al,

[\f. 172r\] And afterward when þou may haue flours of camamille, 
take þe forseid oile with þe braunche3 of camamille and 
boile þam eftsone3 vpon þe fire; and as it is seid afore, 
putte to a litel watre or elle3 a litel vinegre, þat is better, 
þat þe oile may be more penetratyue, and boile it vnto þe 
wastyng of þe watre or of þe vinegre; and þat is knowen 
by boiling of þe oile made with noyse; þan cole it, and 
3ette it ri3t hote vpon þe floure3 as it was seid. Oile of 
camamille is temperate, and it is a blissyd þing of many 
helpyngs, and it is a conuenient resolutyue, and of akyng 
sedatyue, and it is prohibytyue of curse3 of humours for a 
litel stiptikne3 in it. It comforteþ synowe3 and al synuy 
membrye3; It helpeþ to þe akyng of þe heued, And generaly 
it availeþ to al akyng, and it is conuenient to al complexions, 
and it is ri3t subtile. And als mych as it 
dissolueþ so mych conssumeþ it.

In tast it is as war bitter, bot in vertu anence old men it 
is deemed expert and effectuale, and kynde & free to 
medicyne in many vse3; witnesse plinius, diascoride3, 
macrobu3 and many oþer, whos rote3, rynde3, and branche3 
and leue3 and floure3 bene profitable in medicyne3. It

intercutanie3 wher-so-euer þai bene gedred in þe body. 
Also it availeþ most agayn3 brissyngs of membre3 and 
falle3, if þe membre3 be fomented in his decoctions. ffor 
why; it mitigateþ þe akyng, it ceseþ þe bolnyng, it ministreþ 
vertue and strength to synowe3 and to ioynture3. It 
availeþ agayne3 bolnyng of þe womb of cold y-dropisy, if 
his Iuyse be dronken with hony and comyne. And witte 
þou þat þe Iuyse of walwort, or þe poudre of it if it be 
hadde redy, is namely in euery medicyne þat is restrictyue 
of blode. Þe maner of makyng and kepyng of it is as þe 
maner of licium seid afore. 
 
41. Valence of scabious or of Iacee albe is þus made: 
Recipe Iuyse of scabious in somer, and cole it þur3 a cloþe; 
and tak swyne3 grese clensed of þe skynne3 and stamp it 
wele in a morter in smytyng it bot no3t in brekyng 
vtterly; and euermore putte in a litel of þe iuyse to þe 
grese þat it may wele be imbibed and þat þe talow may 
be made grene; þe which y-done, tak þat grese and couer 
it with þe forseid iuyse and so late it stand 9 daie3. And 
after 9 daie3 take eftsone þe forseid grese with þe iuyse 
and stamp it as afore, and putte out þat þinne watryne3 
and discolored þat goþ out þerof, and so lat it stande 5 
daie3. [\f. 173v\] After þe 5 day eftsone tak new Iuyse of scabious 
and stamp it, as it is seid, with þe forseid grese; þe which 
|P_98 
y-done, latte it rest in a vessel with þe iuyse al a fourtny3t; 
which tyme ouerpassed, eftsone3 bete it as it is seid 
afore, and purge it of þe watrine3, and putte it in a clene 
vessel, and lat it stand stil anoþer fourtni3t, And þan 
brisse it wele vnto þat it be al of grene colour. And whan 
þe nedeþ for to vse þerof, as vnto þe antrax, putte þerof 
with þi fynger vpon clene stuppe3 of lyne, and strech it 
and lay it on þe antrax anoynted with oile of rose, and 
remeued it no3t by a naturel day. ffor without dout it 
schal slee þe antrax and swage þe akyng, and brist it and 
vtterly cure it. And þis medyc[{in{]e is called Valence of 
scabious for þe valow of it. It may be kepte many 3ere3, 
bot it is better if it be euery 3ere renewed and bette newly	 
with oile roses, and putte vp agayne vnto it nede. And 
witte þou þat scabious y-dronken sleep þe antrax, and 
putteþ away þe venym of it fro þe hert þat it sle no3t þe 
pacient. Also þe same herbe ydronken turneþ inward 
aposteme3 to outward and putteþ þam out insensibily. 
Also witte þou þat new scabious & fresch y-brissed with 
swynes grese and putte vpon antrax sleep it in a day 
naturel, and takeþ away þe akyng for certayne. Bot for 
þat scabious may no3t euermore be had redy & fresch, þerfor 
was þis medicyne made þat may long be kept, þat 
wonderfully sleeþ þe antrax and vtterly cureþ it, as I haue 
proued myself ane hundreþ tyme3. Also witte þou þat 
Iacea alba is scabious, bot Iacea nigra is matfelon. And 
witte þou þat þat scabious þat groweþ among corne3 with 
ane heuenly flour is better þan þat þat groweþ in mydowe3 
þat haþ no flour. After diascorides trowe þou to þis þat 
it haþe no pere to þe forseid þing3 wonderfully to be 
done, and þat softely. I haue proued it a hundreþ tyme3 
for certayne. 
 
42. Valence of wormode is þus made: Recipe iuyse of 
wormode, smalach, plantayn, and with swyne3 grese clensed 
wele of þe skynne3 brisse it wele and long togidre in 
maner as it is seid afore of þe valence of scabious; þe 
which y-done, kepe it to þin vse. Þis valence of wormode 
availeþ to brissyngs of legge3 and of schynbone3, and to 
wounde3 þat ar made in þe muscle3 [\f. 174r\] of þe arme3 and of þe 
legge3 with a strey3t wounde, as of a knyfe or of ane arowe, 
|P_99 
[^FIGURE OMITTED^] 
|P_100 
or of sich oþer. And it availeþ to al wounde3 for to hold 
þam opne, and for certayne it mitigateþ wele þe akyng. 
When þe nedeþ for to vse þerof in wounde3, 3ette in first of 
oile of rose3 or of violet 2 droppe3 or þre, and anoynt al 
þe wounde about of þe same oile3, and þe membre þat is 
hurt. And afterward putte aboue of þe forseid valence 
vpon softe stupe3 of lyne, and bynde it competently, and 
lat it so abide a naturel day. Þis medicyne, forsoþ, 
represseþ wele bolnyng and akyng and holdeþ þe wounde 
opne, and gendreþ quitour, and draweþ out venym of þe 
wounde, and quencheþ þe brynnyng of þe membre. Þis 
oyntment, forsoþ, luffed I mych: with þis medicyne cured 
I a fischer at london, which was hurt in þe lacert of his 
arme of þe prikkyng of a scharp yren standyng on þe 
gymewe3 at þe frere Carome3; Wherfore he was almost 
dede, what of akyng, bolnyng, and brynnyng, and what 
of þe vncouenable cure of a barbour þat putte in þe 
wounde scharpe tente3 of lynne cloþe, and putte aboue 
diaquilon. His cure, forsoþ, remoued away, I putte to 
about euensang-tyme of þe forseid valence with anoyntyng 
of oile of roses, And bifore cokcrow þe pacient was 
delyuered of akyng and þe arme biganne for to swage, 
and in the mornyng he sleped wele, and þe arme was 
purged of quitour by the wounde. Bot witte þou þat I 
putte no tent in þe forseid wounde, bot al-only with 
3ettyng in of oile and puttyng aboue of þe valence without 
any-þing atuix I cured hym finaly; wherfor I gatte 
mych honour. At nothyngham, forsoþ, I cured anoþer 
perfitely with þe forseid medicyne, þat was smyten in þe 
arme, bot no3t þorow, with a knyfe; of whos life men 
despaired for akyng and anguysch of þe pacient.

wex, and kepe it to þine vse. And when þou wilt vse 
þerof, Anoynt his front, his pulse3, his temple3, his armehole3, 
and his lone3 of his heud and his fete, and alsone 
he schal slepe so þat he schal fele no kuttyng. Þis is 
also if a man may no3t slepe for oþer cause, as in febre3 
or sich oþer, for þis oyntment ouþer schal giffe hym

is done to hym. And þis proued I myself for 
certayne. And witte þou þat it spedeþ for to draw hym 
þat slepeþ so by þe nose and by þe cheke3 and by þe berde, 
þat þe spirite3 be quickened þat he slepe no3t ouer ristfully. 
Also be þe lech warre þat he giffe no3t opium
