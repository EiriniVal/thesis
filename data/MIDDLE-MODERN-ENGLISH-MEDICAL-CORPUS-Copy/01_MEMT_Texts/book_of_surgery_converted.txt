[^BOOK OF SURGERY^] 
 
[\f. 6r\] Ryght as betwyx wheter and darnell whyll 
þe erbes be grene and schewes not schape 
of þe erys than ys ther so gret lyknes in the erbe 
that þe darnell fro þe whete may not be 
dysseueryd but whan þe erbe of whet aperyth 
than may þe darnell opynly be knowyn 
well inowgh fro þe whet. Ryght so in 
same maner of wyse as longe as falsed vnder 
þe color of trewth ys hyde yt may not 
be dysseueryd ther fro. And for that nowadays 
in surgery þe darnell of arror with þe 
whete of trewth growys to gedyr amonge 
full sympyll letteryd men sum be fantasyd of a 
penyzous in diuerse ynglysch bokys and for 
the gret lyknes þat ys betwyne þe grene 
whete and þe darnell be for þe herynge 
dyscrescion may not be gyffyn betwex them 
as longe as thei be hyd vndyr þe color of 
ynnorance. But whan þe error of trewth ys 
knowyne than may þe darnell of error 
be pullyd owt be þe rote and castyn away. 
Therfor þat þe darnell of surgery may be 
done away yt ys nedfull þat þe eyrys of 
þe whet of trewth may be mad opyne be 
þe knowlege of þe pryncypylles of this crafte 
of surgery. Wherfor to þe worschype of all 
myghty gode and his glorios modyr saynt 
Mary and all halows and to þe prophete of all 
crysten pepull and namly of studyars of 
practyzars in surgery I haue compylyd and made 
this boke jn þe yer of owr lord M=I=CCCC & 
xlvj jn þe wyche I haue set þe pryncypylles 
[\f. 6v\] with the secundarys as þe kalendyr makyth mencyon. 
 
[}Capitulum of comon thynges þat ar nessessary to 
a surgen and what ys a surgyne and how he 
owyth to gouerne hym in all hys curis 
both dowtfull and dowtfull}] 
Sirurgia .i. sugery yt ys sayd of this word 
aros of grew þat ys to say in hand in ynglysche 
and of gyros a word of grew þat ys to say wyrkynge 
in ynglysche as who sayth connynge of 
handewerke. Wherfor yt semyth þat throw 
konnynge of surgery seknes may be remevyd 
away and helth may be kepyd after þat yt ys 
possybyll to be in generall. 
 
Practyse of surgery ar dyuerse þat ys to say to 
wyrke in softe membrys and in harde in generall. 
But in specyall ther ar v þat ys to say connynge 
to wyrke in postumes and konnynge to teche 
to wyrke in woundys and konnynge to wyrke 
in vlceres and festurys and old sorys and cankyrs 
and connynge to restore flesch agayne and awoyd 
place with medycyns. Comown jnstrumentes parteynand 
to þe same to surgery ar ij þat ys to 
say comon jnstrumentes perteynand of medycyne 
and comyne jnstrumentes of yrone. Instrumentes 
of medycyne ys dyetynge with powdyrs 
drynkes anoyntmentes and emplastrys conuenyent. 
Instrumentes of yrone sum ar to 
kyte as scherys rasours and lancettes and sum 
jnstrumenttes to brene wych ar cald cautarryes. 
And sum jnstrumenttes to draw owt 
diuerse thynges as tonges pynson. And sum to 
know depnes of sorrys as spatturs and 
[\f. 7r\] sergours and sum be to sew as nedyll and pypys. 
And yt ys nedfull to a surgyne to hau thus 
many propertes of oyntmenttes in store with in 
hym þat ys to say a maturatyfe onyment a 
consondynge onyment a clensynge onyment a 
kelynge onyment and an hetynge onyment. 
A surgene owyth to haue thes condycyons. 
On ys to be eloquent and lettyrd. Þe secund þat 
he be experte. Þe thyrd þat he be wytty. Þe iiij=te= 
þat he be well manerd. For the fyrst þat he 
be well lettyrd as for to haue þat undyrstondynge 
in þe pryncypylles of surgery as in 
theoryke as in þe practyke to know naturall 
thynges wyche ar comprehendyd in athonamy 
þat ys to say to know þe makyn of euery party 
of mannys body. For the secund þat he be 
experte. Is þat he vsyd þe crafte aforne or 
haue sene othyr men werkynge ther jn. 
For all wyse surgens afor this tyme 
say and aferme þat yt be hovys every surgyne 
to know and afterward to haue þe vse and 
experiens ther of. For þe thyrd to be 
wytty and to haue good mynde and sotyll 
of consayttes and jmagynacyons and of good 
avysment and fore syght with perfyte vndyrstondynge 
with goodnese of contynuance and ther of face 
and schape of body and þat he haue small 
fyngyrs and stedfaste hondys not tremelynge 
and cler of syght. The iiij=te= þat he be well 
manerde that ys to say bold and hardy in sekyr 
thynges. Ferfull and dowtfull in perelles to 
exchew from evyll currys and for to be 
gracyus to seke folke and mercyfull to pore folke 
and not to covetous but resonabull to resayne 
his selary consyderand þe labour of þe curre 
and þe worthynese and þe pouerte of þe pacyent 
and not to melle with no cuers þat he supposys 
ar not curabyll. 
 
[}Capitulum 2=m= of the pryncypull longynge to 
surgery and of þe partys ther of}] 
It ys to undyrstond that fesyke owyth to 
be determynde of iij thynges pryncypally 
perteynand to the same konnynge wych iij 
pryncypull þer of that is to say naturall 
thynges and not <on>naturall and thynges þat ar owt of 
kynde. Off þe wych iij on of them pryncypally 
longyth to surgery þat ys to say naturyall 
thynges wherfor yt schewyth that surgery 
ys þe thyrd parte of physyke. And syne yt 
ys so that physyke mells with all thre and 
surgery but with one of them iij þat ys to say 
naturall thynges. Yt may wel be sayd therfor 
þat phesyke ys an vniuersall crafte and surgery 
but partyculer crafte. Ther of ensampull: 
To an hows longyth iij pryncypall thynges 
that ys to say þe grownd þe wallys and þe rofe. 
And ryght as þe grownd be þe selfe nor the wall 
be þe selfe nor þe rofe eydyr be the selfe 
ys not a hows but eche of them be þe selfe 
ys but a parte of an hows ryght so ys surgery 
but þe thyrd parte of phesyke wherfor 
surgery ys but a partycular crafte and phesyke 
an vniuersall crafte. And surgery ys devydyd 
in to partis that ys to say speculatyfe 
and practyfe. 
 
[\f. 8r\] Fyrst that he owyth to know þeorice .i. speculatyfe 
þat ys to say hym be hovyth to know 
his pryncypulles of his crafte. 
For who so knowyth not þe pryncypull of his 
crafte he schall fayle of þe secundarys ther 
of. And thow schalt know þe pryncypulles of 
surgery ar naturall thynges þat ys to say 
all the membrys and partis longynge to mannys body 
with ther qwalites and ofycys longynge 
to them with naturall thynges namly he may 
not know with owtyn anathomye. As all auctores 
of this faculte aferme in the wyche knowlege 
stondyth his theoryke be þe wyche theoryke 
knowynge and warkynge of hondys 
be procese he schall haue practyke of surgery 
þe rather. 
 
[}Capitulum 3=m= wych anothomee 
owyth to be know with þe presynge ther of}] 
All myghty god blyssyd be thow þat threw 
thy helpe hath grawntyd me in this compylynge 
to schew þe prophettes of anathomie 
wych ar moste nedfull in surgery. For 
as galyene sayth and beryth wytnese on 
a boke cald vtylytas particlarum saynd 
that þat þe anothomie is good to know 
for iiij comodytes. On ys to cause hym 
to lufe hym and prays hym þe mor concedyrand 
how wondyrly be his purwayer euery parte 
in a manys body ys sett in dew perfyte ordyr. 
Anothyr ys to know þe worthynese and þe 
offys of euery membyr consyderand how ychon 
helpynge and socurynge to odyr with nedfull 
with diuersnes of offys and wyrkynge longe 
[\f. 8v\] to them. The iijde cause to know þe dyspocycion 
of membyrs and ther qwalites be wyche 
pronosticacion may better be hade of them þat ar 
dyscresyd with any sykens wher threw thei 
ar curabyll or not or whedyr thei schall 
be helyd in schort tyme 
or longe. The iiij=te= to know þe ryght 
cours how þe waynys arteryes 
cordis or swych othyr maner thynge 
be þe wyche þe surgen schall rather exchew 
perell in incusyons. And of knowynge of the ij 
laste Galien sayth in a boke cald tegnum 
that alonly not yonge surgens but also 
old surgens schuld study them for dyuerse 
causys thai ow to dyueres þe cure after þe dyversnese 
of the membyr and thes olde sorys þat ar myche 
depe. But now adays ar many surgens 
of name but not of dede. And I say as Galien 
says þat thei trespas oft tymys for cause 
of vnkonnynge of anathomie and pryncypally 
in kuttynge of sennys and strynges. And resone 
wyll þat a craftyous man know that thynge 
that he wyrkys one. Wherfor fysyke sayes: Omnis 
artifex tenetur scire suum subiectum in 
quo operatur alias operando erat. And a surgen 
ys a craftyous man for mannys body ther 
for yt ys nedfull for hym to know þe natur 
and þe makynge of mannys body. 
Wherfor yt folowyth that yt ys nedfull 
to a surgene to know anathomie for yt farys 
be a surgen þat knowyse not anathmie as yt 
doth be a carpenter that may not well se 
and schuld hew ryght a tre and doth not but 
[\f. 9r\] takes mor in one place or lese in anothyr place 
than he schuld and so he errys for fawt 
of syght. Ryght so doth a surgene that knowys 
not his anathomie wher yt ys nedfull pryncypally 
to know his anathomie. 
 
[}Capitulum 4=m= in what wyse yt was fyrst made 
and fownd be wykkyd men dampned to deth 
and be ded men as drown or slayne and be 
what vnresonabyle bestis and how a ded 
man schall be vndone to se and know best 
euery parte of hyme}] 
This word anathomia of Latyne wyche ys 
to say in ynglysche anathomie ys to say a 
ryght devydynge and determynge of membyrs of 
euery yche body and namly of mannys body 
for of þat ys þe intent of all surgery. And thys 
word anathomia ys sayd <of> anos a word 
of grew þat ys to say ryght and thomos .i. departynge 
þat ys to say ryght departynge. Anathomie ys sowght 
in dobyll wyse. One ys techynge of bokys yf 
all yt be profytabyll yet yt ys not allynges 
so sufficient as ys the othyr maner of anathomie 
for tho partes of the membyrs may better be sene 
with eyne in ded than in letters wretyne on þe 
boke neuer the latter man ys schorte and slydynge 
away ther for yt ys nedfull to haue syght 
of anothomie wretyn in letters. The secund 
maner of anathomie and experyens is of dede 
mens bodys for lechys may be experte 
throw syght of newly dede mennys bodys 
as of them whos heddys haue be smetyne 
of or hangyne be þe wyche may be made 
[\f. 9v\] anothomie of membyrs and offyces inwarde 
and of the flesch and brawne and skyne of many 
waynys and arterres and senewys be 
the wyche dyuerse had and many has 
knowlege of the anothomie and pryncypally 
in this wyse. Do þe body to be layd on a banke 
the on parte of the body vpward and þe 
nethyr parte downwarde and do make þer 
of iiij lessonnes after whan þe body ys opyn 
and euery holow parte longynge ther to. 
In þe fyrst parte schall be tretyde of nutrytyffe 
membrys as þe stomake with þat þe <at> 
longys therto. In þe secund parte schal be 
tretyd of þe nutrytyff membyres and þat 
at longes ther to. In the thyrde parte 
sowly membrys. And the iiij=te= þe extremytes 
of the body as armys and legges with þat longyth 
ther to. Off the wyche iiij partys membyres 
ar to be consyderyd 9 thynges that ys to 
say 1 settynge 2 substance 3 complexcion 4 quantyte 
5 nowmbyr 6 figur 7 þe colygens 8 þe gendrynges 
9 actis .i. dedys and þe utylytes .i. profyttes. 
And yf thow wyll serge this besily in þe 
anothomie as yt ys wretyne her after 
of membrys thow schalt know lyghtlyar 
what syknes may fall in þe membrys be þe 
wyche thow may make pronosticacyon 
whetyr þe syknes may be holpyne or not. 
And anothomie may be had of dede mennys 
bodys set on gebet in somyr tyme and dryd 
in þe sone be home may be had knowlege 
of bonys grystylles nerues ioyntes tenauntes 
[\f. 10r\] .i. holders .i. collygacions and genderes togedyr. 
And be thes maner of ways Galien 
in mennys bodys apys swyne and othyr 
many bestis come to þe trowth of knowlege 
of anothomie and othyr worthy lechys 
also. Wych anothomie he dyde 
wryght in bokys be þe wych othyr lechys 
after warde myght haue opyne knowlege 
of anothomie by diuerse pynctures of schap 
of membres as sertayn lechys haue vsyd afore 
þis tyme. 
 
[}Capitulum 5=m= of all partes of 
all the anothomie}] 
Syns þe anothomie ys made of þe partis 
of mannys body yt ys nede to tell what 
ys manes body. And I say þat mannys body 
ys one thynge with moste perfyt resone made 
fayr and of many diuerse membyrs particulers 
compounde simpyll membyrs ar. Undyrstand 
þat ther ar sum sympyll membyrs and sum 
compounde. Sympyll membyrs ar thes þat 
ar lyke kynde and not dyuerse of þe wyche 
ther ar 11 in nowmbyr þat ys to say 1 grystylles 
2 senews 3 vaynes 4 arteries 5 pannicles 6 lygamentes 
7 strenges 8 skynes 9 flesch 10 herys and 
11 nayllys. And sum of thes membrys ar 
blody to whom may not be made consendynge 
for cause thei ar gendyrde of blode 
as ys fleche and fatnes. And sum ar sparmatyke 
membyrs and so thay are cald for 
cause thei haue ther begynnynge of sparme 
and to them may be don no gendyrynge 
nor non consondynge in trew wyse as 
[\f. 10v\] ar bonys and all othyr membyrs of þe for sayd 
sparmatyke membyrs. Also mor ouer of þe 
sympyll membyrs sum ar hote and dry and sum 
ar hott and moyste and sum ar cold and moyste 
and sum cold and dry. Membrys hote and drye 
ys þe skyne. Hott membrys and moyste ys 
blode materially the spyryte and þe flesche. 
Cold and moyste ar flemne and fattnes and 
marow. Cold and dry ar all þe todyr 
as bone grystyll herys corddes ligamentes 
senews waynys and pannycles wyche thynges 
forsayd ar notabyll and nedfull to know 
þe complexcion of þe sayd membrys. Thes ar 
cald compownde membrys wyche þat ar compound 
of the sympyll membyrs. And thai ar cald 
organica that ys to say jnstrument membrys 
and thei ar cald so for thei ar jnstrumentes 
to þe sowle. And thei ar thes handys fett 
face harte and lyuer and thei ar cald instrument 
membrys for thei schew tokyns of vertues 
and wyse as þe soulle desyrys and wyll. And 
thes forsayd compound membrys sum ar pryncypall 
membrys and sum ar not. Pryncypall 
membrys <as> ys þe harte þe lyuyr þe brayne and 
stonys. And not pryncypall ar all þe 
othyr. And of all thes othyr excepte þe 
pryncypall membrys sum ar lese as eyen 
and nose and odyr and sum ar mor as hed face 
and othyr of wych afterward yt schewes 
playnly. And yf all thes instrumett membrys 
be compownd of many thynges for 
cause of accion and passion of them with 
qualite and quantite in þe plasmacion neuer þe 
[\f. 11r\] latter sum sympyll membyr amonge them ys þe 
begynnynge of all þe arte and þe othyr sympyll 
membrys ben for cause of prophet for cause 
þe arte may be done the better. Odyr membrys 
for soth for kepynge of all thes be 
made as handdes. The harte þe wyche ys þe 
fyrste organic membur ys made of pannicles 
lygamentes hard lacertmise flech. Therfor yt 
ys sayd to þe dry of multitude of spyryttes 
beynge jn yt for yt ys as <a> fyer chymney 
of all the body yt is sayd to be hote. 
The brayne ys cold and moyste in kynd 
and yf all yt haffe a marow substance 
neuer þe latter yt ys dyuerse from marow 
for yt ys of a brayne humdite of þe 
sparme and therfor yt ys sayd hote 
after natur. The splen .i. þe mylt and þe 
kydneys ar hot membrys and moyst 
and þe splen ys þe undred lowar than þe lyuer 
and þe kydneys lowar than þe splene. The 
flesche of þe longges holdyn lese moyste þan 
fatnese for yt ys not so lyghtly multene 
whan yt ys chawyd. Also yt ys sayd 
to be hote for yt ys noryschyd 
with sotyll blod sent fro þe harte. And vndyrstond 
that euery membyr ys of swych complexcyon 
as thei reyoyse of thynges latter þat ar cunynge 
to them. 
 
[}Capitulum 6=m= of skyne fattnes 
flesch and brawne}] 
It ys fyrste to begyne of þe skyne for þat 
begynyth fyrst to make anothomie 
for cause yt ys moste owt ward part 
[\f. 11v\] of þe body. The skyne ys þe couerynge of þe body 
knyt to gedyr of threddes senews and waynys 
made to haue defens and fellynge ther of. Off 
the wych skynnys ther ar to kyndys. Sum skynnys 
ar to keuer owt ward membyrs and sum inward 
membrys. The skyne that coueryth owtward 
membrys ys cald cutis and the skyne that 
keuers þe inward membrys ys cald panniculus 
as ys dura mater and pia mater wyche 
ar þe skynnys þat keueres þe brayne or cyphace 
and cichoy. But cutes ys cald þe skyne þat 
keuerys þe skull or armys and legges and syche 
othyr. Next after the skyne folowes fatnes 
and yt ys as oyle warmynge and moystynge þe 
membrys. Off þe wych fatnes ther <ar> to 
kynddes. Sum ys inwarde next the skyne and 
ys cald properly adeps. Ther ys anothyr 
fatnese inwarde and þat ys by þe wombe 
and þe raynys and that ys cald axungia. 
Next after the skyne and the fatnese 
folowth þe iij=d= kynde that ys to say pur flesch 
wyche ys but lytyll and yt ys foundyne 
alone in the hede of þe pyntyll and in þe gomys 
betwyx þe teth. Ther ys also glandewles 
or granelowse flesch of þe ballokes of þe tettes and 
in þe armholles and in the leskys. The iij=de= kynde 
ys musculouse or lacertous and swych ys mych 
and <ys> fowndyn jn the body as brawne 
of þe handes armis and legges and swych othyr. 
And sum cal yt swych maner of braune as 
þe mowse wherfor certayne pepull callys 
yt þe mowse of bonny lege. And þe langage 
[\f. 12r\] ys trew for yt hath þe schap of a mowse for 
ryght as a mowse ys smale from þe heyer ende and 
longe toward þe tayle and in þe myddys gret so ar certayne 
brawnys in mannys body. And for cause 
a lesarde ys smale at eydyr ende and gret in 
þe myddes therfor sum lechis call syche brawne lacertes. 
This maner of brawne ys compound of nerues 
and ligamentes and fyllyd with softe flesche with 
a thyne skyne keuerynge yt. And after þe muscle 
ys compound as yt ys sayd of cordys and rownd 
lygamenttes descendynge from yt. And whan thei 
come ner þe joynte with þe pannicle to gedyr 
keuerynge the bonnys and þu move yt and whan 
thei pase þe joyntes as sone thei ar roundyde 
and ryd in to acorde and with flesch thei

agayne goth owt a cord and a ligament and þei 
ar spred abrode and thei bynd in þe goynge 
abowt þe joynte and moue yt and thus yt sessys 
not vnto þe vttyrest partycle. And after this 
muscle euermor goth afor a yoynte and a membyr 
and that yt movys and yt ys declaryd in 
þe armys. The nervys þe wyche ar sent 
fro nucla of þe neke vnto þe armys takyth 
the schape of a muscle in þe neke and in þe breste 
and afterward cummynge to þe joynte of þe spawd 
þe cord ys caste owt and spreddes abrode and yt 
comprehendyth all the joynte and yt ys set in þe 
bonne callyd adiuterie and yt movyth yt and 
whan yt goth owt fro þe joynte of þe schulder 
be þe space of ij fyngyrs or iij. yt ys rownd 
and browght in to acorde and with flesche and 
[\f. 12v\] þe ligament þat goth owt fro þe hede of þe bonne of þe 
spawd. Yt muscules aboue þe adiutorie from þe 
qwyche goth a corde wych all iij fyngyrs fro þe 
elbow ys largyd. And comprehendyth all þe elbow 
and yt movyth the lytyll arme and after othyr 
iij fyngyrs yt ys rownddyd and browght in to a 
corde wyche gothe in with þe lygamentes þat goth owt 
from þe elbow and with þe flesche yt makyth musculys 
above þe myddys of þe forsayd arme fro þe wyche 
owt acorde wyche fro þe fyngur fro þe joynte 
of þe lytyll fyngyr is largyd and comprehendyth 
all þe joynte of þe forsayd honed. and afterward 
yt ys roundyd and yt goth in a muscle 
emyddes of þe honde from þe wyche goth owt 
corddes mevynge þe fyngyr. Off þe wyche 
yt ys schewde of wounddes þat ar at iij fyngyrs 
ner þe joynttes bon perlyous for nerves 
and corddes þat ar ther aperynge for þe wyche 
and a prykynge be made yt may cause a dedly 
crame. And þu schal undyrstond þat þer ar 4 
deferens of lacertys and muscules in 4 
dyueres maner of thynges þat ys to say in quantyte 
in fygur in possicyon .i. in þe place wher thei 
ar set in composycion and in spryngynge of corddes. 
And ther ar iiij posicions of muscles and þat 
ys to saye on ryght anothyr ouerwharte 
and ij crokyd. Off muscles ar 31.
