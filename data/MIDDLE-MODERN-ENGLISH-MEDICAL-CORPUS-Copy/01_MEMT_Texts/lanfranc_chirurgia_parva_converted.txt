[\f. 19r\] [}Here begynnyþe þe prologe of þe las book of þe sayd 
Maister langfran}] 
Leve frende Bernard. I 3it will make A booke in which 
I will take by þe grace of god a full lore þat fallithe 
to þe instrument of Surgery. ne I thynke not in this wark 
to rehersse bot short, fewe and sad medycinis. nertheles 
for gret nede I ne hold hem not feble, but to hem þou 
myght fully trust. for I set aftir thi biddyng assayed 
cures and a short maner of curyng of woundes, postumes, 
bylis, cankers, festers, and som curys of eyen, and of 
Algebra A littill after that skyll taught me to werke 
And thorowe experience by long tyme by me confermyd. 
I trust so muche to þe sotilte of thi witt that by 
this fewe þou shalt com to A gret werk and thorow that 
thow shalt haue þe name of a gret leche. 
 
For vnderstond that in yche wark þe leche shall haue 
a certeyn end in his þouthe and vse þingis þat to hym 
helpyn to his ende. But in woundys to hele thi first entencion 
shal be a sotyle sowedyng þe whiche may not be 
made but in sympill wounde made in flesshe, for why 
othir lymes and bonys and synnes, grestelis and webbis 
of ffell ne bethe not souwed by verrey restrenyng, 
for her mater is the seed of her gadryng, bot in stede 
of þing þat is lorn of hem þat is restored a thyng 
þat halt his stede þat was y lore. Than dyuerce 
opynyons bene of synnes, veynys, and Arteryng. ffor why 
som wene þat hy bithe sowyd sotillyche and som say 
nay bot bene restoryd. But I say nay, thay bene nought 
sowed sotillyche whan her keruyng is gret. And þei be 
sowyd sotyllyche whan here keruyng is littill. but 
flesshe wosse mater is blod þat iche day is getyn 
|P_67 
[\f. 20v\] in body ressayuith sotelliche restoryng wherfor A wound 
made in flesshe algat by þin entencion to sovdy but 
sowyd thynges whit sayde. 
 
The first is if ther be pryckyng in þe skynne. 
 
The secunde if ther be wounde in bone. 
 
The thirde 3if wounde is enpostume. 
 
The fourthe if ther [\empty space in MS\] be eny dyscrasy. 
 
The fifte if in þe wound be eny holownes. 
 
The sext if þe wounde be made with brusyng. 
 
The vij if þe wound be made with venemus best the which 
vij ledith þe leche to an othir entencion as I wole showe. 
 
Than woll I begyn at A sympill wound that hathe noon 
of theys vij thyngis. I say than þat if the wounde 
be made with þe poynte of A wepyn that is sonest 
holyd as of A sper, of A knyfe, or An arowe and othir 
ylike, for if he ne touchid no senewe ne no webbe that 
he hit þe bone vndernethe the tokyn of whiche is whan 
þer is noon Akyng, it is no nede but ley a littill tent 
I wet in oyle of Rosse that holdith the hyed opon on 
day and make þe seke rest from all warkes. And when þer 
is no warkyng ne no swellyng, suffre þe wounde to 
close and let hym rest ij days and he shal be hole. If 
he haue Akyng, it is token of touchyng of synnes or of 
cloþe, than it is nedfull þat þou fyll þe wounde of 
oyle of Roset hote and make A tente not to gret ne to 
long but suche one that he streyn not þe synewe and 
þat it make noon Akyng and weet it in oyle and with 
þe white of an Aye. And ley þer vpon þe self medecyne 
[\f. 20r\] and smer þe fell with A medecyne made of A vnce of 
|P_68 
oyle of Rosse and ij dramys vynegr and dimidio vnce 
boly Armonyake and do ther to till that þe Akyng be 
ago. After that put in the wounde a dry tente of 
nesshe clothe all on and aboue A mundyfycatyfe that is 
made of iij vnce of hony. ro. coled and an vnce of 
smale barlyche mele and dimidio vnce of turpentyne y-wasshe 
and boyled a lyttill to gydder to þe perfeccion 
of a playster not hArd and so at þe ende he shall 
be hole. If with þe holdyng in of boly. Armonyake and 
oyle ro. forsayde ne the Akyng sesith not, do þe seke 
to let hym blode if he be strong in þat othir halue 
a3eyne the wounde. If he be febill, do hym to be garsyd 
And make hym to sitt with a soppotory and enyoyne hym 
a streyt dyet till the sessyng of the postume, that is 
to sey, till that be certeyne that noon enpostume shall 
com in the wounde and the Anoyntyng made of bole 
Armonyake and oyle of Ro. and vynagr Algate be contynewid 
as y sayd. Ne in no maner for swellyng of towechyng 
of synew ne ley þou noon emplaystre of herbys, of smer, 
nor of no matratyue ne for Akyng ne touche not the lyme 
with hote water, for all theys bene in cheson of 
rotyng and lesyng of lyme. 
 
[}If A wound be made withe a Swerde.}] 
3If A wound be made with swerde or othir thyng kervyng 
in lenghte is so littill alone with plumaceoles may 
hold the partyes y Ioyned it is ynowe to Ioyne the the 
partes and ley plumaceoles of hardys wet in þe white 
of an eye and bynd it with A bond and thowe hast noon 
[\f. 21v\] othir nede to do noon othir medecyne. If the If the 
|P_69 
wounde be so gret that the byndyng suffice not, sewe 
the wounde with a squar nedyll, evyn threde waxid and 
make þer als many steches as is nede sowyng. by tuyx iche 
steche an vnche and leue in the nether ende an openyng by 
the whiche thow shalt put in a tent þat shall clence the 
wounde. Aboue the sowyng lay A powdre one part made 
of encence and ij parties of sandra and iij parteis of 
quike lym and othir whill quik lyme dothe nede and so 
ley of þe powedre in a clowte wet in the whit of an 
Aye. after that bynd it with A bonde and plumacioles 
to saue þe sowyng and so chauge till it be sowyd 
to the ende. If in this tyme þe wounde be chaunged 
þorowe þe Ayre, þan make it to whetir. to opyn it take 
a medecyne of whet mele and hony and water sothen 
to gydyr to þe ende. In the ende lay vpon þe woude 
hardys wet in hote wyne. 
 
[}Of wound made in synewe and his cur.}] 
Wnder stond her that yf the wounde of a swerd or knyfe 
touche eny senewe in Arme or in fote, honde, or hyppe 
were corven thuarte ouer Thowe þat þe oderyke and 
many othir say contrary, it is good and nedefull to sewe 
the synewe with a nedyll. whan thowe sowes the wounde, 
sewe þe hedes of the senewys to giddir aboue and vpon 
the sewyng ley oyle of ro. in whiche bene sothen 
long erthe and kepe þe sowyng bothe for þe sewyng of 
the senewe with entent. of this sewyng comyth a nobill 
sowdyng so that othir while specyaliche in body by suche 
sowyng is rekeueryd the stirryng of þe lyme to whom 
seruith þe synewe kytt the whiche had not be rekeueryd 
[\f. 21r\] ne the sewyng had bene in þe senewe. Ne dred þou not 
|P_70 
Akyng that comythe of sewyng of senewe. suche akyng 
is lyssed anoon with the forsaid oyle. ne no suche 
akyng may not make a crampe for all þe ker/vyng of the 
senewe. 
 
[}Of flux or rennyng of blode out of þe veyn or Arterie.}] 
3If the rynnyng of blode of veyne or Artere lettith þe, 
streyne hym thus. TAke of encence on parte and Aloe 
halfe a parte and make powedre and do hem to gider with 
the whit of an Aye till it be als thyke as hony. And 
herys of an hAr coruen smale put þer to and set thi 
fyngyr on the sted þer as the blode rennyth out and 
hold it A whyle and ley I nowe of þilk medecyne vpon 
it. And be war when þou chaungist thi playster. take 
nou3t away thi playster with strenghe. And if it cleue 
fast to þe wounde, ley vpon þe same medecyne more nesshe 
vpon þat othir medecyne till þat he fall away by hym 
selfe with outyn vyolence, for þan is þe veyne sowedid. 
And to this medecyne is noon lyke to staunche blode 
and sowde A veyne. 
 
[}Of woundys or of b ys.}] [\“b ys” a blurred word\] 
Whan with wounde of flessh is wound in boon, it is no 
nede to hele þe wound of flesshe to the boon be restoryd, 
for boon is not sowedid, bot in stede of boon wexithe 
a maner flesshe harde þat is clepirus sarcoides as 
boon full of many smale holys that stant in stede of 
A boon. And this restoryng of boon shall be made or þe 
wounde be sowedid in the flesshe, for ellys the boon 
shall not be restoryd for the moyster of the flesshe 
wold let it, for þe bonys in her kynde bene dry. they 
must be restoryd and norysshed with thyng þat is light, 
for norysshyng is þorow thyng that is lyght and 
dystruccion is þe contrary. And among all woundys þe 
woundes in þe hede is most perelus. if in þe woundes 
|P_71 
[\f. 22v\] in the hede with brekyng of scull wher the wound of þe 
flesshe helyd or the boon wer restored, it wer incheson 
of dethe for the noblenes of þe brayn and þe cure of 
þe bone I shall be gyn. 
 
[}Of tokens of þe brekyng of the scull.}] 
When woundys be made in þe hede with brekyng of skull, 
take hede if þe brekyng of þe skule be percyde and 
passith inward. þat þou myght wyt in many maner by 
lusshyng of castyng and of Akyng and shorte lokyng 
hedus and rollyng of his eyen. and an experiment is 
þat fallith not: Put by tuyx his tethe a thred twynyd 
or a stryng waxid and touche þe stryng with thi 
nayles fast by his mouthe begynnyng and goyng toward 
þe ende þat shal be fro þe mouthe a cubyte long 
and do þat oft. if þe seke may suffre it, his skull 
is not broken. And if the scull be broken, he shall 
not suffre it. And so smyte a light stafe on his hede 
þat is dry of withy or of pyn and ley thi nere to his 
hede and if þe boon be hole, þe sounde shal be hole 
and if it be broken, þou shall her þe sounde dyme as þou 
heryst a bell þat is broken, for the sound of A scull 
and of scull broken is lyke to þe sounde of a bell 
hole and a bell broken. Ne abied þou not þe token of 
wele etyng and well goyng to foreyns and of othir 
whiche sygnis Roger and Boulane we se desayvid. But 
whan the tokyns bene open to the by touchyng of the 
scull, se if þe wounde in þe fell be lesse þan the 
brekyng of þe scull and make it more so þat þou se no 
tokyn of dethe, for than no newe thyng is to done. And 
when þe wounde of the fell is so muche þat the brekyng 
of þe scull shewith hym, se if the boon þat is brokyn 
be of good restoryng vnder the hole. Or if ther be 
eny littill pece of boon þat touchith þe sefte moder, 
|P_72 
[\f. 22r\] ffor in theis tuo causes the behovith to do away the 
boon with instrumentis and littill pecys þu shalt 
þus do Away. and loke wher the brokyn boon holdith 
hym with the scull and ther it shall be a littyll 
felt and othir whill all rowelyche it shall be dyvyd 
down. than fill all þe scull broken oon day or two. 
And in þe wounde vpon the scull ley smale hirdes or smale 
pecys of clothe wett in oyle of ro. and þe yolke of 
an Aye. The second day or the iij traveyle with thyn 
instrumentes lyghtlych to do away the boon and remove 
þat is to remove lyghtlych so þat þou touche not the 
soft moder or eny begynnyng of senewe. Right so remeve 
þe littill pece not touchyng the soft moder bot 
lightlyche. When the boon is away, take a thyne clothe 
and take one parte mell roset and two partyce of oyle 
of Ro. and wete lynnyn clothe þer in and softly and 
lightly ley it by tuyx þe scull and þe softe modir 
and fill all þe wound of þe scull lyghtly with þe clothis 
so ywet. In the wounde of the flesshe ley pecys outhir 
herdys with þe yolke of an ay and oyle of rose and 
haue a pleumaciall of smale herdys þat it be clype 
all þe wounde and more and wet it in the self medecyn. 
At þe last take a gret pleumaciall or many herdes y wet 
in cold water in somer and in wynter in hot. And wele 
ewrug whiche þou shat wete in a medecyne made of 
ij +o of oyle of Ro. and halfe +o of vyneger and a +o +s of 
bole Armonyake whiche pecys I wet in this medecyne and 
leyd vpon the hede. first be the hede yshaue and do þus 
to þe wounde make whetyr muche. And þan begyn to ley 
vpon þe soft modir a sotill powedr made of encence 
that it go Adown by the brayn and above þe powedr A 
clothe wet in mell roset and the forsaid oyle. bot þan 
[\f. 23v\] the clothe of þe wound shall be wrong of whiche clothe 
|P_73 
all the wounde shall be full þat is in the scull. in 
the wounde of the fell put dry hardes and folowe it so 
þat thow suffre not þe flesshe growe hier than the 
scull tyll the scull be helyd. and abowe þe wounde of 
the fell lay a mundificatiue that was said abowe of 
mell roset and flour of barlyche that it over go þo 
wounde an vnche. all about þat algat lay a defensyve 
of bole Armonyake afore saide. At the ende lay a consolydatif 
or a sicatrisatyf whiche I shall teche in the end 
of þe warke. In all othir kyttyng of the scull and 
brekynges bot in the forsaid two cause it is enowe As 
lege vpon þe bone to breke a medysyn of mele Roset and 
þe yolke of an eye till it make whetyr and aboute 
A defensyue of bole Armonyake. And whan it makithe 
whetyr, lay above the scull a pece ywet in þe same mell 
ro. and fill þe wound of þe fell with dry thredys and 
above þe wounde a mundificatife of mell ro. and barly 
floure and aboute þe wounde a defensyue of bole 
Armonyake tyll it be hole. 
 
[}Of gouernaunce of the wounde.}] 
The kepyng of all othir woundys that bene with out 
brekyng of scull may be done with sowyng and the forsaid 
powedre of lyme and with the forsaid dyet. But it 
behovithe hym to vse mell ro. and oyle of ro. eche after 
othir and the yolke of an eye and oyle of ro for 
it makythe mater. and afterward it mundifiethe of oyle 
of ro. and hony and barly flour and a defensiue of bole 
is best in yche A wounde of body. forto eschew apostume 
ther is no better thyng to the seke ne noon more worship 
to the leche than saue þe wounde fro swellyng and apostume, 
fro Apostume þat comythe to wound of hede is cause 
of crampe and dethe and corupcion of hym and dethe. And forto 
|P_74 
[\f. 23r\] eschewe a postume and kepyng of diet is nedfull and 
ther fore I shall teche þe a goode diet to iche man 
þat hathe a wounde in the hede or in stede of synewe. 
 
[}Of diete in þe hede and synewy places and of specyAll medecyne þer fore.}] 
A speciall diet fro the begynnyng 
shall be cromys of bred. washe hym with hote water 
in wyntir and afterward thrise with cold. and after þe 
last wasshyng lay vpon hym of sugr Roset [\empty space in MS\] in somer 
wasshe it in cold water and make thi grewell of barlyche 
first laide in water and after that grownde and colid 
and sothyn with penedius or sugur roset or with almonde 
mylke. in iche maner woundis bot in woundes of the hede 
I alowe not Almondis, for they make a fumosyte that 
anoyethe þe hede. If the the seke were to febill or 
kyndeliche had a febill stomake, he myght ete chekyns 
with vynagr and of A kyd and swynys fete and all with 
vyneagr or with wyne and pomegyrnates. And his dryng 
speciall þat is woundid in þe hed and in synewe placis 
schall be wyn garnett with dowple of cler water, or 
cler Aysell, of cold water, or of this water þat is 
best and comfortith þe stomake and defendith fumosites 
to go to the hede and it streynith not and it staunchth 
threst. TAke clene barliche +o ij, cromys of bred +o j, of 
pome garnet +o j, and x dry plomes. all þes sethe in x 
li of water till haluendele be sothen in. and cold it and 
kepe it in A glasyn vessell and kepe it cold. If the 
seke be yong and sangewyn and littill blode is comyn out 
of þe wounde, let hym blode on the contrary syde or 
ventuse hym as I saide. Make hym go to sege with 
suppository if he may not be hym. for all theis with defencyfe 
of bole Armonyake kepyn þe wounde and þe lyme woundid. 
When all rennyng of humour is sessed and þou art sekyr 
|P_75 
[\f. 24v\] that noon enpostume shall com, litill and littill make 
þe seke passe to gret dyete and to vse wyn, saue in þe 
woudys of þe hed and of senewe ne 3eve no leue to drynke 
wyn but it be gret nede and þan let it be li3t wyn 
sherpe and wele evaterd. for þer is no thyng that so 
smytithe in þe hede and senew as dothe wyn and þer fore 
in suche woundys it shall not be grauntid for it come 
to þe ende. And whan a wound fallith vpon othir bonys 
and þai be broken, thow shalt hele hem as I shall tell 
the in the chapitr of Ioyntours. whan a wound es inpostumede 
that fallithe for þe leche couthe not defend it, 
outhir þe tent was to gret, or þe solaster was to hote, or 
chaungyng of the Ayre, or febilnes of þe lyme þat ressayved 
the medesyn if suche apostume be rn sted full of senewys, 
the cure is saide. If it be in a lyme full of flesshe, 
þou shalt make a past of x partes of water and of oyle 
and flour of whet and ley it vpon þe postume in wounde 
and ley it so long ther on till all þe swellyng and 
Akyng be Away and þat the wounde myght whetyr. And ley 
a mundyfycatife of hony and flour and water till it be 
wele clensed. for no wounde that hath enpostume shall 
not be soweded till þat it be rype and swellyng and 
Akyng sesyd. and þan clense it and after that sowde it. 
and if þer be eny dystemprur away [^FIGURE OMITTED^] turn a3eyn 
to thi pryncipall cur. And if þer be in the wounde eny holowenes, 
fill it full of flesshe, for if þou hele it abowyn 
and it be holowe be nethe than shall ther be wheter in the 
holownes and shall rote the stede and makyn the leche to 
the wounde and than shall the last traveyle be worse 
than þe first. ffill it than with a mundyficatife 
[\f. 24r\] afore said leyd vpon þe wounde and a powedre of encence 
|P_76 
layde with yn or with an oyntement regenatyfe 
whiche I shall say in the ende of this boke. after that 
sowed it. And if þe wounde be makyde with brusyng as 
with fallyng, or smytyng with stoon, or with tree, or with 
othir thyng nowght sharp, þou shalt first lay a 
consolydatyfe, for in yche brusyng bothe in flesshe and 
senewe bethe ybrused. And if þat stede be full of sennes, 
it behow=t= that þe stede rot, for þe thyng that streynyth 
holdith the wheter with in and so all þe lyme rotethe 
or thowe must vndo that þou hast sowedid, and þat wer 
travayle to þe and pynne to þe seke, for long pyne in A lyme 
ledithe all þe body in to corrupcion. And þer fore þu 
shalt first rype it and after þat clensse it, and if þer 
be eny holownes, þou shalt fyll it with flesshe and at 
last þou shalt sound it. And if þe brusyng be littill, 
þou shalt sone hele it with an oyntyng about with oyle 
of ro. and vpon [\empty space in MS\] lay A powedre of my [\empty space in MS\] and 
clence þe wound with hony and after that sownd it. 
 
[}If A wounde be mAde of A wode hownde and the cur ther of.}] 
3If a wound be made of A woode hounde, þe tokyn is þat 
ane henne will not et of þe bred þat is wet in the 
wounde and if she do, she shall dy. þe best is to let the 
wounde open iiij days and cautere þe stede with an hote 
Iryn and lay ther to of hote medecynys as salt, mustard, 
and hony and do othir lechecrafte þer to of whiche this 
is the best. Take of Aschyne of crabbis of þe watir 
þat bene brent fyve parties, of genciana iij parties, 
of erthe sygillat vj parties and make a powedre of hem 
[\f. 25v\] and 3ef to drynke ij drames all a day yche monethe with 
|P_77 
water of sothen crabbe. and after foure days sowd the 
wounde and hele all thynges after thi wit. 
 
[}Of Apostumes of the humours.}] 
Of Apostumes þou shalt vnder stonde that þei come of 
of two skyllys. þat one is with out as smytyng, fallyng, 
or chaungeyng of wounde, and suche thyng. And an othir 
skyll is with in as to muche superfluete of humours þe 
mater of whiche comythe syxfold. for outher it is of 
humours or of blode. Outher of fleweme, or coler, or malencoly, 
or waters, or wyndes and all þat oon. Outher to gedder 
thay apostume seld be of one humours. vnder stond þat 
blode whan it is to mechell in þe body and is heet with 
hote brynnyng þe herte and rotithe no3t, it makythe 
feuer continue and if he rotithe, he makythe feuer þat 
is clepid synocus continuus. If it is not in all the 
body bot in a stede and þe blode be thynne and substaunce 
and brynnyng in qualite, it makythe a rede bladeryng 
brode sprede vpon þe lyme þat is clepyd here sypula notha 
that is made of blode þat is gederd to kyndell hete. If 
þe blode be gret in substaunce and kyndelyche and þat 
in qualite it makythe A carbocle whose colour is wan 
and in touchyng is hard and aboven is a colour as it 
wer 3elowe þat comythe of brynnyng. And if the blod be 
kyndelyche to muche in quantite, it makythe swellyng. 
And þeis been þe tokens: Rednes, hardnes, swellyng, 
dethe in þe flesshe, A gret pousse for þe gret hete, and 
othir whylys feuer, namelyche whan it gaderthe wheter 
and all theis tokyns bene more afore þat it makythe wheter 
than after. 
 
[}Of coler enpostumes.}] 
|P_78 
[\f. 25r\] Colr whan it maisterithe þe body it is rotyn or it is not. 
if it be roten outhir it is in all þe body and þan

makythe it an evyle þat is clepid serpygo. Colr roted 
outher it is with in veynys and then makithe he a feuer 
tercyan cotedian and if it last in all the vaynys and 
specially aboue the hert outher þe mouthe of þe stomake 
or with out þe veynis, þan makyth it a feuer tercian interpolat. 
And if suche colr wer gederd in eny lyme with out,

tokyns of hem bene thesse: Rednes medeld with yolownes 
and swellyng and hardnes and prekyng hete and bytyng

[}Of flewme enpostumes.}] 
Also flewme þat maisterith þe body or it is rotid and withe

Efemera continua with out shakyng. Outhir it is with outyn

withe shakyng. If it be roton or it is not vpon all the 
body and than makythe it an evill þat is clepid leuce 
flumanciA that is a spice of the droposy. Outhir it is 
in one stede and than makythe it Apostume þat is clepyd 
symiA and his tokens bene theis: it is whit and nesshe 
so if þou puttist it with thi fyngur, thowe shalt make 
a pyt, a littill or noon werkyng, for ther is bot litill

hathe made wheter þan afore, for þan rotithe þe hete, for 
whi iche enpostune is hote thowe some be of cold mater

for cancre worchithe and is of many colours and ther fore 
he is callid cancre, for as A fisshe þat is callid cancre 
hathe many fete so this empostume þat men clepithe 
cancre hathe many colours and also he is rownde as the 
fysshe. 
 
[}Of Apostume wAtery.}] 
A A postume watery comyth of to muche water and colde 
gaderd vpon þe leuer. And othir whill it is on A stede 
and specialy it is vpon the navyll or ther Aboute. And his 
tokyns bene that is of þe colour þat is the body and if 
þou touche it with thi fyngurs so þat oon be a littill 
from the tothir, thow shalt fele a swetyng of water 
vnder thi fyngures. And þis enpostume is hevy and with 
outyn werkyng. And I had some of this enpostume with 
carvyng and dryvyng of þat water in the wound that 
was with in þe navyle as gret as a loofe of two pownd. 
 
[}Of Apostume wynde.}] 
A a postume of wynde is made of cold watry bot for defaute 
of hete þat not defiethe it. that is leyd by tuyxe the 
|P_80 
[\f. 26r\] two kyrnellys of the lyme and specially in the mouthe of 
the stomake and in the flanke or the shar so þat it 
semythe as it wer a man broston. And his tokens bene 
theis: he is hard, stroutyng and as a bag full of wynde 
and if it be smetyn, his synnes ne his colour chaungethe 
not fro þe colour of the body and this apostume is muche 
lyke to þe forsaid Apostume hard as þe hardnes of A 
stone. for hardnes of sennes bledder blowyn and full of 
wynd who can know þat oon postume from þat othir. And 
also this Apostume is lyke to þe Apostume watry, bot 
þat it is full of water and this full of wynde. 
 
[}Of postumes in þe throte.}] 
Ther is Apostume cold þat men callith a boche þat oft 
is in þe neke þat comythe in two maners. outhir a wheter 
gaderd of an hote enpostume. Outhir of dyuerce flume 
rotid. and he þat is lyke flume som is lyke chese rune 
to gider, som is lyke to clay, som in as drastes of oyle, 
som is as a iuent full of graynys. And of iche of 
theis som bene nesshe aboue in the lyme alone vnder þe 
fell and som is depe in lyme þat hathe no colour. By 
the thyngys þat bene said of postumes a symple man may 
kun the natur of compound, þat is to say of postumes that 
bene gaderd of dyuerce humours of þe whiche þou shalt 
vnder stonde of Apostume is made bothe of color and of 
blode and if the more party be blod, flegbotondes and if 
þe more party be color, it is clepid her sypylades and 
men shall knowe hem by tokenyse aforesaide. Also in 
apostume bene gaderd blod, color, and malencoly and make 
byn Antrax whiche been theys tuo tokyns: hardnes and 
aboute dyuerce colour and in this he acordithe with þe 
cancr, bot in this they be dyuerce. ffor in the Antrax 
is more swellyng and feblenes of hert and swemyng and 
[\f. 27v\] quakyng of hert and depe [\empty space in MS\] and aboue þe blader of 
|P_81 
þe colour of asken and semythe drawe inward as it wer 
drawe with a thred. 
 
[}Of coler and vste in apostume and the cur of it.}] 
Of brent coler mengyd with malencoly makythe dyuerce 
enpostumes aftir dyuerce quayntite and dyuerce sted and 
dyuerce strenghte and of febilnes of the lyme in whiche 
he is. and in som of theis is more parell and in som 
after the nobley of þe stede in whiche he is. ffor whi 
of theis tuo humours ben made iueles bules with grustus 
whiche if thei be in þe ouermast of the lyme speciale 
of þe flesshe, thei bethe cankers as saithe Auysenne. 
If he be depe in the lyme bot not in all the lyme, he 
clepithe hym Ascachill. If he be in all þe lyme, he is clepid 
herpes and he is made of muche mater venemosse which 
þat is gaderd of many byles. And oft I haue said and 
saithe it is þat whan a feble lyme is leyd a3enst þe 
cold eyr, þan the endes of the lyme bene ded, for kynde 
het ne myght not come to hem so þat me behovethe to kytt 
all þe lyme as þe fote in yontoure for to saue þe legge. 
Also in this maner bene made bledders, formikes, muliaris, 
prunes, and wildfyr of whiche is welnygh all one maner 
cur as I shall teche the. 
 
[}Of cur of Apostumes and cause fro with out forthe.}] 
The cur of postumes þat bene made of causes with out. If it 
be of wounde the cur is saide, bot if it be of brusyng or 
of fallyng, or of smytyng of stone, or of staffe, þe best 
cure is if the seke be 3ong and strong forto let hym 
blode or ventuse hym if he be febill. And an oynte þe 
stede with oyle of ro. hote and lay þer on a powedre 
made of [\empty space in MS\], for this cur strengthis the stede if 
þe brusyng be not to grett. But if þe stede be not 
|P_82 
[\f. 27r\] kepte from apostume but comythe to gaderyng of wheter 
is most hengyng and clensyng the stede with a mundificatiue 
made with hony and floure of whete and water. aft þat 
fyll it with flesshe and sowed it with incarnatif and 
consolidatife. And ley aboute þe stede a defensiue of 
bole Armonyake and oyle of rose and viger to kepe þe 
hole flesshe that it rot not. 
 
[}Of Apostumes fro with inforthe.}] 
Of Apostume þat bene made of cause with inforthe long it 
wer to tell and þer fore I leue it. But vnderstond þat 
thou myght bryng þe curys of all maner of postumes in 
two, that is to say in to þe cur of apostume hote and 
cold. þe hote outhir he shall be agayn smetyn or resolued 
or rypid. The cold shall be rypid and resolued and 
harder and seldom a3eyn smetyn. By gyn þan þi cur of 
an hote postume with lettyng blode if þe pacient be 
hole and þat in þe syde contrary at begynnyng or þe 
postume be rotide. when he is holde and rotide, let hym 
blode in þe same syde þer as is þe postume, or if he be 
febill deppe hym and enyoyne hym a streit diet and 
cold after þat he may suffre, for iche postume hote is 
if þat a man be to full of humours þat þe mater smytithe 
agayn and comfortithe þe lyme þat he vnderfong not 
superfluete bot if oon of þe vij thynges a3eyn say it 
and suffre not þinges that been repercussyue. The first 
is if þat þe postume be in a childe. The seconde is if 
it be in an olde man. The third is if it be in a man þat 
is keueryng of sekenes. The fourthe is if þe mater 
be muche. The v is if þe mater be colde. The sixt is 
if þe postume be vnder þe Arme, in þe Armehole, or in the 
shar, or in þe neke. The vij if þe postume comythe out 
of a stede þat is more noble þan þe stede þat he is in. 
If noon of theis let the in a hote postume, lay ther to 
repercussiue as þe Iuse of solatre and of purcelane, 
[\f. 28v\] wild humblyce uenerris with oyle of Rose and a littill 
|P_83 
vyneger and a littill of bole Armonyake or Anoynte it 
with an oynement repercuscyue. whan þou hast I done þese 
if þe mater go not a3eyn for he is gret, purge þe body 
and solue the mater and do to þe medecyne repercuscyue 
and a littill hony and resolu it with a light resolutiue 
þe whiche I shall teche the. If the mater drawe to 
wheter whan þou hast leyd a repercusciue or A resolutiue, 
hy the fast with a maturatyue þat I shall teche the. 
whan wheter is made, open þe stede þat is most rype and 
make gret yssues if þe mater be gret. And if þe mater 
be littill, þan thrist out all þe wheter softly. If þe 
mater be mechill, the mater shall be þrest lytill and 
lytill namely if þe pacient be febill. whan þe stede 
is open and þe whetur out all or som, lay A lewke mundificatiue 
and kyue þe flesshe and sowde þe wound, bot 
luke þat þou hight not to carue þe postume till it be 
rype bot it wer nyghe a nobill lym or nyghe a yointour 
or þe mater were dysposed to Rote all þe lyme. ffor in 
theis iij thyngis it behovithe to kerue Apostume or it 
be full rotyn and þan make a playster to clence þe 
wounde. And take hede what þu resoluest and ripist and 
clansest þat þe plaister be not to hote ne to cold bot 
in temper, for to hote or to cold maketh þe Apostume 
wode. þu shalt vnderstond þat hote apostume is of blod 
and nedith of lesse repercussiue and lase resolutiue. 
And as þe sanguine is purged by lettyng blod, so coleryke 
shall clensyd by purgacion. The Appostumes þat be made 
of humours brente haue nede to haue repercussiue by for 
þe whelyng and after that it whelys, but þou shalt lay 
about it a defensyue of bole Armonyake for to defend 
þat he sprede not ne frete. 
 
[}Of AntrAx and cArbocle.}] 
A antrax or carbocle for als muche as þat oon is of 
diuerce humours and þat othir is of gret humours 
[\f. 28r\] blode lettyng and purgacion þei haue nede of enplaysters 
|P_84 
and mettis and dryngkys to comforte þe harte for her 
malyce and specially þe antrax þat is worst of all enpostumes 
and venymost. he shall haue þan a diete þat shall 
cold hym as pome garnade, double of cold water. he shall 
forbere flesshe after his myght and if he may not, he 
shall ete garnadys soþen. Also not fully men 3eue hym 
triacle muche and if he swone and ligge as he slepte, 
awake hym with a gret sownde of trumpis and taborus 
and call hym hy by his name and ley vpon his herte a 
plaister of A +o of rede rosyn and barly flour ij +o and 
camfre j +o disteperd with ewrose. If þe sekenes wer 
withinforthe aboute þe tetis or the brest, lay þe playster 
by tuyx þe two shulders. Som man myght haue vonder of 
þe 3evyng of þe triacle for it is hote. Thowe shalt 
vnderstonde is hote nertheles of his nobill and nofull 
composicion he hathe a sperit so frendfull to mankynd 
þat we fyndyn hym good for venyme is cold and hote. And 
also he stirrythe þe wombe and it rynnythe so þat I 
say sekyrly þat right as yche thyng hathe a kyndly 
compleccion comun and oþer proper and priue, so triacle 
hath a compleccion comun and I preue a3eynst all maner 
venyme þorow the kynde of þe thynges of þe whiche he is 
made. And therfore he is gode to all maner postumes hote 
and cold. And I say to the that in þe Cite of Mylan com 
a 3ong man þat had an Antrax in the face of suche gret 
malyse þat hede and þrote and neke was wonderly swollyn. 
And a spicer þat was þat mannys frende besought me to 
hele þat man. And I sawe in hym tokens of dethe and bad 
the spicer lede hym home to his house þat he myght dy 
in his bed. And he answerd, maister is þer noon othir 
helpe with the? And I be þought me and said, for sothe 
if þou haue eny nobill triacle to 3eue hym a good 
[\f. 29v\] quayntyte percase he myght lyffe. The spycer had hym 
|P_85 
home and yafe hym a noble triacle . ij. +Q and leyde hym in 
his bede and hillid wele. and anoon hym toke a swet 
aboute þe hede and after in all the body and þan he was 
muche comfortid. and after that he was awakyd, þe spicer 
on his owyn hede 3aufe hym another drame of þe selfe 
triacle and anoon he was hole. but þer abode a bleder 
full þat was lyghtly helyd. And I ne sawe neuer noon 
that afterwardes 3eykyd and had quakyng of hert and speciale 
with outyn pou3 as this was þat ascapid. This I haue 
told of triacle for in case theis wourdes myght aveyle 
some man and delyuer hym of dethe to goddes worship þat 
euer more be blyssyd. After þat þe harte is comfortid 
and þe mater is put out, þou shalt rype the carbocle and 
þe antrax with her proper maturatiuis þe whiche I shall 
tell in þe ende of this book. All othir wode Apostume 
bene helyd by þe selfe remedy as comfortyng of hert 
and of þe membre. And after that it is boyled, it shall 
be helyd þorowe þe cure of bules. 
 
[}Of A colde enpostume.}] 
A postume cold shall be helyd with clensyng of body and 
specially with [\empty space in MS\] of turbide þat was our maisters of 
the whiche I shall tell þe in þe ende of this booke. and 
after clensynge þou shalt resolue this mater and rype 
it bot for as muche resolucion may not be made. bot 
with medycines resoluyng and rypyng and þe postumes cold 
and scrofulis and glandulis and knottyn and clensyng 
bochis þer fore þe medecinis þou shalt seke in þe end 
of this booke. 
 
[}Of biles and vlkes and þe cur ther of.}] 
Of biles þou shalt vnder stond þat dyuersyn from woundis, 
for wound is an hurtyng newe ymakyd with kervyng of Iryn. 
Bot byle is an old sore rotid. And also hit devysed from 
cancre and fester as in kynde and spice, for iche cankre 
[\f. 29r\] and fester bene bylys, bot iche bile is not cankre nor 
|P_86 
fester. And in þat hym shew=t= the erreur of Roger and 
Roweland þat sayn þat iche bile þat passithe to thre 
monethes vnhelyd it is nobill. Than out of bylys comys a 
grene þing with a gret nesshe rotyn wheter. And if þe 
whetyr be 3olowe or rede, wasshe it with cold wasshynges 
as water in whiche is resolued Alome and water of bere 
and feches and blomys of þe tre þat berithe pome garnettes 
þat is clepid balaustia. And if it be not colouryde, 
wasshe it with water of hony and if the lyme be full 
cold, wasshe it with hony and wyn whiche þou shalt put in 
byle by hym selfe or with a clystere till þe water come 
out suche as þou puttyste yn. And if þe bile haue eny crust 
or haþe flesshe mengyd with wheter, clense it with þe 
poudir of Affodill and gren oyntement and an oyntement 
of Aposteles which I shall tell þe in þe ende of this 
booke. And if þe byle be bygyleng, staunche it feruour 
and lay aboute þe stede of bole Armonyake and aboven som 
stiptyke or corosyue þat I shall say at þe ende whan 
thou shalt perfitely clence with þe forsaid playsters. 
mundify kyndly þe flesshe with a regeneratife and hele 
it as I shall tell the. But on thyng þou shalt vnderstond 
þat clensyng with vomet is muche worthe. And vnderstond 
þat evyle bylys bene benethe forthe. And vnderstond þat 
this cur is certeyn, for whi þe medesine that helyth 
þe byle stirrithe from stede to stede out of þe stede of 
þe bile and holdith anothyr way by þe whiche þe bile is 
clensyde. 
 
[}ffor the cankre and the cur ther of.}] 
Vnderstond þat cankr outhir he is with bile outhir he is 
not. that is with outyn bile þat is with malencoly roton 
goton fro þe begynnyng as we sayden in þe cur of Apostumes 
and then he shewyd hym as a lupyn and wexithe othir while 
as gret as a melon or he is made of turnyng of an hard 
[\f. 30v\] postum þat comythe of malencoly. If he be malyngcoly not 
|P_87 
rotid whan þu playsterst hym with brynnyng playster and 
othir þinges hot þat drauwyn hete to þe stede, þan of 
this cur comythe an othir. And othir while he comythe 
of woundes vnwysely helyd. Cankre with out byle in þe 
begynnyng is not li3t to knowe bot of hem þat is perfite 
in warke. cankre with byle haþe theis tokens hathe 
theis tokens: his lyppis bene gret, hard, and agayn flode 
with small kyrnell with yn and stynkethe muche. A 
generall rewyle is in his cur is þat he is not all ryght 
helyd bot he be done away with all his roton. And of 
this rewyle comythe an othir that he shall not be helyd 
with yryn ne with fyr ne with mater corosyfe bot he 
be in stede that he may not be done all way. in stede 
entrykyd with synnes, veynys, grystelys, and artareus as 
in neke and in the tetys and in othir steddes lyke þou 
shalt not rype hym, ne rote hym, ne carue hym, ne cauteryse 
hym bot clence þe body with purgacion þat purgethe brent 
coler and en yoyne hym a temperate diete and forbede 
hym metesgret and brennyng þe blode as cole, lekys, 
chese, harys, maulardes, peper, and all þing sharpe. and 
anoynte þe stede aboute with an oynemente withe drawyng 
hys malyce and defend hym from bulyng. and þis oynement 
is þus made. Take toty and wasshith and seruse an~. and 
meng hem with oyle of Rose and þe Iuse of percell or of 
an other cold herbe. entemper it nowe layng of Rose and 
ynow of þe Iuse till þou haue perfite oynement. If he 
be in a stede that he may perfitely be takyn away, kerue 
hym with all his rotes and let ren out muche blode out of 
þe veynys that bene about and threst it þat all þe 
malencolyus blod may goon out. And than cautaryse hym 
[\f. 30r\] with an hote yryn or with a brynnyng medecyne. after 
|P_88 
that lay a past made with the Iuse of smaleache and 
hony and flour of whet till it be clensyd. after that 
kyndell the flesshe and sounde þe wounde. If þe cankre 
þat is with out bile be in stede entrykyd so þat he may 
not be done away ne perfitely helyd, it is better þat 
he be not touchid with brynnyng thyng ne with hote 
Iryn. bot he may be wele helyd with vasus oynement aforsaide 
tuty and with þe kepyng aforesaid so þat the 
seke may haue lenger lyfe. 
 
[}Of fistula and þe maner of cur.}] 
Fester is depe bile þat hathe a streyt mouthe and a brode 
bosum and he hathe an hardnes hylly and wyde with in he 
farith as a pen of a birde. And in this he is vnlyke to 
þe byle þat is depe and therfore þe first is not clensyd 
with in with wasshynges as þe bile þat is dede whiche 
Roger and Rouland and othir many clepyn a fester. But 
a fester behowith aft a wasshyng which I sayd in the 
cur of a byle behovith a medysyn brennyng and sharpe 
outher þat he be clensyd with a cautery and þat be done 
away all þat is hard or callous with yn. and aft þe 
cautre or þe medecyne brynnyng þou shalt ley oynement 
to make fall the roue of þe brynnyng. and after þat 
þou shalt clence it with wasshynges and enplaysters and 
þan kendill þe flesshe and sound it. But vnderstond þat 
þe comoyne remedy is in festers and depe bylis to make 
an openyng in the stede þat is most hangyng þer þe 
wheter may ren out. The medesynes caterysatif and brennyng 
to fester and cankr shall be said in þe ende and also þe 
oyntement þat shall make þe askyr aryse. and vnderstond 
þat þou shalt neuer make with strengthe þe askyr to 
fall but let fall by hym self. 
 
[}Of AlgebrA and þe cur of it.}] 
Of Algebra vnderstond in Algebra is to restore þe [\empty space in MS\] 
|P_89 
[\f. 31v\] and brekyng of bones. for þou shalt vnderstond that god 
was euer more blessed hathe made in mannys body many 
bonis for dyuerce werkes in mannys body which were 
notfull on lyme to stir with outen othir. And þou shalt 
vnder stonde þat ioynyng of bone with an othir is in 
four maners. One maner is whan þat one gothe into anothir 
as þe tothe of a sawe goþe in an othir whan they bethe 
to geder and some tabillys be made. And so bene made vj bonys 
in þe hede. Anothir maner is in lynþing or in gaderyng 
of a bone to A nothir as bene vij bonys in þe breste. 
The þird maner is of ioynyng of a bone in to anothir 
and so bene þe tethe in þe cheke bone. The first maner 
is a yoynyng to gider of bone with an othir thyng that 
is by tuyx as is in the shulder bon in all ioyntours 
þat bene bounde to gider with eny þing þat is bowyng 
þat comythe out of A boon and gothe into anothir. In all 
oþer ioynyng of bones is no kyndlyche steryng ne wilfull 
bot in this. vnderstond then þat wryeng is all oon in 
þe ioyntours and pittyng of bone out of his stede. but 
openyng and departyng may be done som tyme in ioynyng 
of othir bones. If wreyng in ioyntours, first ioyne that 
one bone to that othir as it was aforn. And after ley 
vpon the stede a grete pece of lynne clothe or hempe 
wet in þe medecyne made of flour of cheches and þan 
temper it with gleyr of egges or with flour of whet 
þat flyethe in the myle. after that bynd it with a strong 
bond þat hodithe þe thynges in her stede. vnderstond 
her þat many wassheheth þe stede with hot water and 
feblyth þe lyme and dysposethe þe stede forto ressayve 
Apostumacion. if þou dredest of warkyng, anoynt the sted 
|P_90 
[\f. 31r\] with hote oyle of Rose. And if þou were not at begynnyng 
and many days be passed þat the bone was out of lithe 
and þe stede be hardyd and þe humours remeve to þe 
stede, þan it is goode to bathe þe lyme not oonly in hote 
water bot in whiche water Camamyle is sothen yn fenegrek, 
lynsede, Malvise so that þe bone may better be brought 
in to his stede. And vnderstond that an hote postume is 
in suche a stede and þe seke fele it not, it is an evile 
token. 
 
[}Of doctryne and [\empty space in MS\]}] 
And if eny bone be broken, first turn hym into his stede 
and þen haue a pece of lynyn clothe wet in oyle of Rose 
and ley vpon þe lyme. and after þat ley an othir pece 
in þe medecyne afore said in þe cure of wreyng and vpon 
the lyme ley a bundell of hardys in whit of eyryn and 
vp that ley spelcus couenable to þe lyme and wynde it 
fast with a corde so þat þe lyme mowe not stire hym. and 
so let hym stond x days, bot if on of theis thre þinges 
strene þe to chaunge it. That is to say to muchell 
werkyng þat comythe of to mechell byndyng or rennyng 
of humours for to make apostume or to muche echyng. If 
þer be to muche werkyng or to muche rennyng of humours 
vnbynde it and anoynte it with oyle of Rose and lete 
hym on þat othir syde and streyne his diet till þe 
humours staunche her rennyng. and after that bynd it. 
if þer be to muche 3ekyng, vnbynd it and wasshe it with 
hote water and þan bynde it and let it stond till it be 
sowedid. In the ende of this boke I shall tele þe 
a medecyne good in brekyng of bonys and wryþyng. And 
vnderstond þat in surgury it is full notfull and nedfull to 
a man þat wole wirche to se a maister wele wirche and

[}Of Doctryne and cures of eyne}] 
Vnder stond þat ther is no sekenes in no lyme in all a 
mannys body þat is so vnkouthe as þe sekenes of eyen 
for þe sotelte of þe eysight and þe makyng of þe eyn, 
for he wondirly made of thre humours and vij kyrtellys 
and all theis been so subtile þat thei bethe not perseyved. 
bot in þe webbis of þe eyen a man may wele se þe makyng. 
And vnderstond þat to þe eyen comythe veynis þat mowe

[}Of obtolmiA and the cur of it.}] 
ObtolmyA is Apostume swellyng or rennyng of humours 
of þe eyen. And this evyle othirwhile it is littill, 
othir while it is muche. And oþer while it is right 
|P_92 
[\f. 32r\] evile and right gret. The littill is of fewe humours and 
othir while of hete of þe son or powedre or smoke or 
wakyng and þis is is sone sesed with a diet temperat 
and white of an eye swynged and skemyde and layed in the

and to mony sekenes of þe eyen for as muche as þe whit 
of an eye is cold and wassheyng and hathe a gummosite
