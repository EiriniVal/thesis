[\f. 9rb\] [}The firste chapitle is an vniuersal speche of anothomye 
and of the kynde of membres.}] 
FOr after Galien, þe Lanterne of Leches, in þe 17 book of þe 
Profite of Particles, þe laste chapitle saue oone, foure profites 
beeþ, or condiciouns, of þe science of anothomye: Oone, forsoþe 
and þe moste, is to þe mervayle of Goddes power. The secounde 
is to þe knowynge of þe membres of pacientes. The þridde is to 
þe pronostacioun of þe disposiciouns þat beþ to come of þe body. 
But it is so necessarie to þe helynge of sikenessis and profitable to 
eueriche leche to knowe tofore þilke anothomye. [\f. 9va\] And þat is þat 
Galien saide in þe bygynnynge of þe Book of Sciences or of Innermore 
Þinges: Of leches, nou3t onliche 3onge men but also olde 
men, stodye þai to knowe þe membres and þe sekenessis of ham, 
for it byhoueþ to dyuerse þe cure after þe differences of ham. And 
þogh þoo þinges þat fallen into wittes beþ knowen rediliche, 
whiche þinges forsoþe þat beeþ hidde in depenesse, ham byhoueþ 
a besy man or wise in anothomye and in actes and profites of ham. 
And of þat place þe bygynnynge of all þe Contynent is itake: He 
saiþ (in þe firste book) it is founden þat a leche schal be wise (of 
akynge membres) in knowleche of þe lymes comynge in euery 
place. 
 
And if þat is profitable to phisiciens, moche more forsoþe it is 
necessarie to cirurgiens, nyghe þe doctrine of hymself in 6=to= Terrapeutice 
|P_27 
(þe whiche in þe Arabik translacioun is inamed De Ingenio 
Sanitatis, i. Of þe Witte of Helþe). Cirurgiens not knowynge 
anothomye synnen ofte tymes in kyttynges of synowes and of 
fastnynges togidres. But þou, konnynge þe kynde of eueriche lyme, 
3it forsoþe þow schalt knowe redily þe drynkes and the plastrynges 
þat þai hauen in all þe body and after eueriche membre, when it 
schal happe a wounde to be made in it, if a synowe is kutte or 
a thenoun or a festnyng togedre. Þus ledeþ Henry of Hermondavilla 
by resoun in þe firste book of his Cyrurgie: Euery werkman is 
iholden to knowe þe subiecte in þe whiche he wircheþ, and ellis 
he erreþ in wirchynge. But a cirurgien is a werkman of þe helþe of 
manis body; þerfore he is holden to konne þe kynde of composicioun 
of it. And by þis manere resoun, he is holden to konne 
anothomye. It is confermed by a liknes, for in þe same manere 
wircheþ a blynde man in a tre as a cirurgien in þe body when he 
knoweþ nou3t anothomye. But the blynde man kyttynge þe tree 
ofte tymes, forsoþe as it were alwey, he erreþ in taking [\f. 9vb\] 
vppon hym more or lasse þan he schulde, þerfore in þe same wise 
a cirurgien when he can not anothomye. Suche cirurgiens beþ at 
þe liknesse of euel cokes, to whiche Galien seide in 2=o= Terapeutice, 
whiche kut noght after þe particles or membres, but þai 
foulen or renten, breken or frusshe, and þrowen oute. 
It folweþ þerfore þat it is nedefulle to leches, and namely to 
cirurgiens, to konne anothomye. And al þogh it were nedeful to 
ham to konne wiþ the anothomye þe actes and profites of membres 
(þe whiche beeþ þe þre rootes and elementes of al medicacioun or 
lechynge, as it is iladde conueniently in þe firste book of Ynward 
Þinges), in sparynge to þe lengþe and in trustinge þat Galien haue 
treted at þe fulle of þoo þinges in 10 tretyses of þe Profite of 
Particles i. Lymes (for 3it we haue noght þe oþere 15 tretises translated 
þe whiche he made of Curacioun of Anothomye, as Haly 
witnessiþ in þe ende of þe book Tegni) and Haly Abbas in þe 
firste partie of his Book of Real Disposicioun in þe secounde and 
in þe þridde, and Auicen in his Canoun in þe firste book, neuerþelatter 
here schal not be sette but a grete and material anothomye 
þe whiche may dresse a cirurgien wirchynge in kyttynges and in 
settynges togedre of membres. 

|P_28 
Anothomye forsoþe is a ri3t or euen dyuisioun and determynacioun 
of þe membres of eueryche body, nameliche of manis body, 
for of it is al þe entent of þis crafte. And it is saide of anos, þat 
is right, and of thomos, þat is diuisioun, as it were a right diuisioun. 
 
Anothomye is sought double: oo manere by þe doctrine of 
bookes, þe whiche manere, þogh it be profitable, neuerþelatter it 
is noght inough to telle þo þinges þe whiche beeþ knowen onliche 
to wittes, in þe firste book of the Profite of Lymes, þe 18 chapitre. 
And þat is þat Aueroys seide in þe firste book of þe Collectorie: 
And we make noght schorte to speke of anothomye but for þat þe 
ymaginacioun is schorte in þise þinges and for þe litel comparisoun 
of [\f. 10ra\] þo þinges þat beeþ in it. 
 
Anoþer, by experience or prouynge of dede bodyes. Þey prouen 
forsoþe, in bodies neweliche dede by heed smyting of or by 
honginge, anothomye, at þe leste of þe official membres of þe 
ynnere þinges, of flesche, of brawnes and of þe skyn and of many 
veynes and of synowes, nameliche as to þe bygynnynge, after þat 
Mundinus Bononiensis treteþ, þe whiche wroot vppon þat and 
made it many tymes. 
 
And my Maister Berthucius, by this manere: A dede body ilayde 
on a benche, he made of it 4 lessouns: In þe firste lessoun, þe 
membres nutrityues were treted, for þai beeþ most redily rotynge. 
In þe secounde, þe spiritual membres beeth treted. In þe þridde, 
the membres of lyf beþ treted. In þe fourþe, þe extremytees beth 
treted. And after þe Comentour of þe Sectes, in euery membre 
9 þinges were to be seyne, þat is to say, þe course, þe substaunce, 
þe complexioun, þe quantite, þe nombre, þe schappe and þe 
fastnyng togedre, þe actes or dedes and the profites and whiche 
beeþ the sekenessis þe whiche may happe in it, þe whiche a leche 
schal now helpe by anothomye in knowynge, in schewynge tofore 
and also in curynge. 
 
Thai assaien also nameliche þe anothomye of bones, of cartilages 
or grustles, of ioyntes, of grete synowes, of corde and of ligamentes, 
in bodyes dried at þe sonne or wasted in þe erþe, or in bodies 
alto-freten in a rennynge water or boylinge. And by these maneres 
Galien come to the knowyng of anothomye in þe bodies of men, of 
apes, of swyn and of many oþer bestes, and nou3t by peyntinges 
|P_29 
as the forseide Henry made, þe whiche þat wolde determyne 
anothomye wiþ 13 peyntinges. 
 
What þing forsoþe manis body is (for of it a speche is made 
in all lechecraft), it semeth þat it is al oo þing, honoured or made 
faire wiþ resoun and of many and dyuers membres or particles 
icompownede. 

A lyme or a particle, after Galien in the firste book of Profit of 
Particles, is a maner body þat in al wise is no3t departed ne 
[\f. 10rb\] ioyned to anoþer. And it is isaide þere þat some lymes 
beþ more and some lasse. Þise þinges forsoþe beeþ vnable to 
parten into anoþer kynde. And þat it is þat Auicen seiþ by oþer 
wordes, in his Canoun in the firste book, þat lymes beeþ bodyes 
the whiche beeþ gendred or made of þe firste medlynge of 
humours. And it foloweþ þat of membres, some beeþ symple and 
some beeþ compowned, as a leche may considre largely. 
 
Symple membres forsoþe beeþ like membres, þe whiche beþ 
noght dyuysible into anoþer kynde. Forsoþe what manere like 
partye it schal receyue, it schal be comunynge to alle in þe name 
and in þe resoun. And þei beeþ xi: þat is to say, þe grustel, þe 
boone, þe synowes, þe veynes, þe arteries, þe pannycles, þe ligamentis, 
þe cordes, þe skynne and þe flesch. And wiþ thise beeþ 
nombred þe fatnesse, þe heeres and þe naylles, þe whiche, þogh	 
þai be noght propreliche lymmes but superfluytees, þei hauen 
neuerþelatter a maner of profit and waxinge as þe membres, as it 
was schewed in 2=o= Tegni. And of þise membres, some beþ sanguine, 
whos kynde is geting and consolacioun, for þai beeþ igendred 
or geten of þe blood, as flesche and fatnesse. And some membres 
beþ spermatik, for þei haue her springynge of þe sparme, to þe 
whiche is noþer generacioun ne verray consolacioun, as beeþ bones 
and alle oþere lymes of þe forsaide þinges. 
 
And moreouer of symple membres, some beeþ hote and moyste, 
and some colde and moyste, and some colde and drye. No membres 
beeþ isaide hote and drye, for by3onde the kynde of þe skynne, to 
þe whiche alle the membres beþ comparysoned, þere is no simple 
membre founden hotter and dryer þan it. The skynne forsoþe 
is a mene, nou3t onliche of mannes lymes but also of alle þe 
|P_30 
substaunce of gendrede þinges and corrupt, after Galien in þe firste 
book of Complexions, þe laste chapitle. Hote and moyste membres 
beeþ saide nameliche þe blood (at þe leste materialy), þe spirit and 
þe flesche. And with þe kyndely moisture þai etlen þise wayes, 
[\f.10va\] as Aueroys saiþ in þe secounde book of Collectorie. Colde 
membres and moyste beþ flewme, larde or fastnesse, and þe marye. 
But colde membres and drye beeþ, after here grees, alle þe oþere: 
as, þe bone, þe grustel, þe heeres, þe cordes, þe ligamentes, þe 
synowes, þe veynes and þe pannicules. And þis is þe brode see in 
þe whiche it is not leeful a leche to passe by schippe. It is conuenient 
forsoþe to a leche to resceyue þe complexioun of þise 
membres of a naturel phisician. 
 
The compownede membres beþ the whiche þat beeþ made of 
þe forseide simple or lyke membres. And þerfore þei beeþ dyuers 
in office, and þay may be departed into oþer kyndes, for, in like 
membres, and euery parte of hem kepeþ noght þe resoun of þe 
hole. Þai beeþ clepid lymes and instrumentis, for þai beeþ þe 
instrumentis of þe soule, as þe hand, þe face, þe herte, the lyuer. 
For þe whiche Galien saiþ, in the secounde book of þe Profite of 
Particles in þe laste chapitle: Kynde makeþ alle þe lymmes of þe 
body acceptable to þe maneres and vertues of þe soule. 
 
And of þise membres, some beeþ principal, and some beeþ not 
principal. The principal membres beeth þe herte, þe lyuer, þe 
brayn and þe ballok stones. And other membres beþ nou3t. And 
of þese membres some beeþ lasse, as þe ey3e, þe nose, þe litel 
honde. And some beeþ more, as þe heed, þe face, þe nekke, þe 
schulder bone, and þe oþer 8, by þe whiche þinges, as of þis 
presente, all þe body is diuided by the grace of cirurgical doctryne. 
 
And þogh þe forsaide instrumental membres beþ compownede 
of many þinges by grace of þe dede and of suffrynge of hem with 
dewe quantite and qualite in al manere makynge, neuerþelatter 
oo manere symple makynge and like among hem is þe bygynnynge 
of al þe dede. Þe oþer forsoþe beþ by grace of a manere profitablenesse: 
some þat þe actes beþ made þe bettre, and oþer wiþoute 
þe whiche it was not possible hym to be made. Oþer forsoþe beeþ 
made for þe kepyng of alle þise, as þise [\f. 10vb\] beeþ ladde into 
|P_31 
þe hondes in þe firste and in þe secounde book of Profite of 
Particles and so by consequent in þe folowynge bokes is in alle 
oþer membres. So þat þou schalt vnderstonde, as he saiþ in þe 
fourþe book, after þe beste no body to be ydel ne vayne, but to 
be made after þe nede wiþ convenient complexioun and makynge 
and some good vertues 3euen of þe creatoure or makere, þe whiche 
manere vertues beþ take by lotte in compowned membres and in 
symple, as in symple membres of þe elementes. 
 
The herte, þat is þe firste organyk membre, of þe ligamentis 
and pannycles and of the harde, brawny flesche of þe whiche þinges 
it is made, it is saide to be drye. Of þe multitude of spirites beyng 
in it, for it is a fyry oven of all þe body, it is saide to be hote. The 
leches forsoþe arguen þe herte to be hoote and drye. Neuerþelatter 
philosofres, for it is þe bygynning of lyf, sayen it happely to be 
temperate, or to declyne to hote and moyst. 
 
But þat þat is iseie of þe lyuer of his beynge is þat it be hote and 
moyste, for þe more parte of his parties is fleschy and sanguine and 
wiþ þat to hym beþ sente many arteries (i. wosen). And þe brayn 
is colde and moyste. Þogh it haue a marowy substaunce, it dyuerseþ 
neuerþelatter fro marye, for it is of dyuers humours, and þe brayny 
substaunce is of þe sperme and is saide hote after kynde, in þe 
2 book of þe Parties of Bestes. 
 
But þe mylte and þe reynes, þey also beþ of hote and moyste 
membres, þogh þe reynes beeþ vnder þe mylte in degre, for gretenesse 
of blood the whiche stondeþ in þe mylte, is in the degree 
moche lower þan þe lyuer. And þe flesche of þe longe is sette lasse 
moyst þan þe fatnesse, for it melteth not when it is hette or 
chaufede. Also it is saide to be hote (after Galien þere it is abouesaide), 
for it is norisshed by þe moste sotil blood isente to hym 
fro þe herte, as he, þe same Galien, saide in þe [\f. 11ra\] 4 book of 
þe Profite of Particles. And so by consequent it is to goo by 
resoun of þe conplexiouns of oþer compowned membris, þat þai 
beþ of soche complexioun whiche þat riseþ of þe þinges comynge 
þerto and makynge it. 
 
[}The 2 chapitle is of þe anothomye of the skyn, of þe fatnes, 
of þe flesche, and of þe muscles.}] 
|P_32 
TT is to bygynne atte þe skyn, for it renneþ first in makynge of 
the anothomye. The skyn forsoþe is þe couerynge of þe body, 
iwouen of thredes of þe synowes, of þe veynes and of the arteries, 
imade to defendynge and 3euyng of felyng. Of þe whiche þere 
beeþ two kyndes: some couereth þe vtter membres, and þat is 
propurly saide þe skyn, and of this (in þe xi de Vtilitate, capitulo 
5=o=) beþ ischewed 5 differences. Anoþer couereþ þe ynner membres, 
and þat is ppurly saide a pannicle, as þe webbes of þe brayne 
panne and þat þat is next þe brayne panne coueryng þe brayne 
panne, and þe oþer bones of þe body, as pleura and ciphac and 
þoo þat beþ next þe herte and þe pannicules of alle þe oþere bowels. 
 
Fatnesse foloweþ after, and it is meltynge as oyle, and moystinge 
þe membres. Of þe whiche beþ two kyndes: oo kynde þat is outward, 
next þe skyn, þat is properly cleped larde, and anoþer kynde 
þat is inward, nexte þe wombe and þe reynes, þat is properly saide 
grace. 
 
Folwyngly comeþ flesche, wherof þere beeþ þre kyndes: þat is 
to say, symple flesche and pure, whiche is but litel and only it 
is ifounde in þe hede of þe 3erde and bytwene þe tieþ. Anoþer is 
corny or knotty flesche or fatty, as þe flesche of ballokkes, of þe 
tetes and of þe purging places. But þe þridde flesche is brawny or 
lacertous, and soche is manye. And it is ifounden by al þe body 
wher so euer is schewed mouynge, meltynge and electynge. 
 
A muscle forsoþe, or a brawne, is þe lymme of open mouynge 
and chosen, as it is isaide in þe Book of þe Profite of Particles and 
Of Open Mouynges by all þe book. And þogh brawnes as to 
[\f. 11rb\] felynge beþ symple membres, þai beth, neuerþelatter after 
troweþ, compowned of synowes and of ligamentes and filled with 
þe softe flesche of ham and icouered with a pannicle. And so wille 
Auicen in the firste book of his Canoun. 
 
A muscle and a lacerte beþ al oon, but it is called a muscle to 
þe schappe of a mouse and a lacerte to þe schappe of a lusarde. 
Þese bestes forsoþe beþ smale at eyþer ende and longe toward þe 
tayle and in þe myddel forsoþe greet, and so beeþ muscles or 
lacertes. Nou3twiþstandynge Henry, þat semede to assigne difference 
bytwene ham. 
 
Where it is to knowe, after þe intente of Galien by al þe Book 
of the Profite of Particles, þat after þat a muscle is made, as it is 
|P_33 
saide, of hym rownde cordes and ligamentes goþ downe. And 
when þai come nygh ioyntes, þay beeth made large, and þay bynde 
þe ioynture al aboute wiþ a clooþ couerynge þe bones, and þai 
moven þat ioynte. And whan þai passe þe ioynte, þey beep made 
rounde a3en, and þay beeþ reduced into a corde, and wiþ the 
flesche þei maken anoþer brawne. And fro þat goth oute a3en 
a corde and a ligament, and þay beeþ made large, and þai bynde 
þe next ioynte al aboute, and þai mouen it, and so it cessith noght 
vnto þe laste particles or lymmes. And after þat, alway the muscle 
or brawne is tofore þe ioynte and þe membre þat he moueþ. 
 
And þat is declared in þe armes. The synowes þat beeþ sette 
fro þe nuke of þe nekke to the armes taken þe schappe of a brawne 
in þe nekke and in þe breste. Þan in comynge to þe ioynte of þe 
spawde, a corde is casten out, and it is made large, and it takiþ al 
þe ioynte, and it is iplaunted in þe bone of helpe, and it moueþ 
hym. And when it gooth out of þe ioynte of þe schuldre to two or 
þre fynger brede, it is made rounde and is turned into a corde. 
And with þe flesche and þe bonde þat gooþ oute [\f. 11va\] of þe 
heed of þe schulder boon, it makith brawnes aboue þe myddes of 
þe helpynge bone, out of þe whiche a corde gooþ oute, þe whiche 
at þre fynger brede fro the elbowe þai beþ made large, and they 
taken al þe elbowe, and it move þe litel arme. And after oþer þre 
fynger brede, it is made rounde and is turned into a corde, þe 
whiche entreþ wiþ a bonde þat gooþ out of þe elbowe. And wiþ 
the flesch it makeþ brawnes aboue þe myddes of þe forsaide arme, 
out of þe whiche a corde gooþ out, þe whiche at þre fyngeres 
brede of þe ioynte of a litel hand is made large and takeþ al þe 
ioynture of þe forsaide hand and after is made rounde. And þe 
brawne entreþ in the myddes of þe hand, of þe whiche cordes goþ 
out, mouynge þe fyngres. 
 
Of þe whiche it semeth þat woundes þe whiche þat beþ at þre 
fynger brede nygh þe ioyntes beþ perilous, for þere þe synowy 
cordes beþ made bare of flesche and schewynge, whos prikkynge 
gendreþ the crampe and by consequent bryngeþ in deþe, after 
Galien in þe 3 book of Tegni and in þe 4 Terapeutice. 
 
Lacertes or muscles, by þe auctoritee of Haly Abbas in þe firste 
|P_34 
partie in þe 3 speche of Real Disposicioun, saiþ þat þay dyuersen 
in 5 þinges: in quantite, in schappe, in course, in composicioun or 
makyng, and in þe bygynnynge of þe cordes. Wherof Galien, in 
þe 6 book of þe Profite of Particles: 4 beþ þe courses of muscles: 
forþri3t, vpsadowne, and 2 euelong. Alle muscles beþ 531, after 
Auicen in þe firste book, of anothomye of muscles. 
 
[}The 3 chapitle is of þe anothomye of synowes, of ligamentes 
and cordes.}] 
FOr þat þe brawnes beþ compowned or made of synowes, ligamentis 
and flesche, after þe anothomye of brawny flesch of 
hem it is to be seide. 
 
A synowy is a symple membre to 3eue felynge and movyng þat 
is made to brawnes and to oþer lymmes. And þerfore Galien saide, 
in þe fourþe book, þe [\f. 11vb\] laste chapitle, of þe Profite of 
Particles or Lymes: 3 manere intenciouns þere beeþ of kyndely 
departynge of synowes: And oo manere of þise departynges is 
þere felynge is in felyng membres. Another forsoþe is of mevynge 
in mevynge membres. And anoþer forsoþe in alle oþere to þe 
knowynge of circumstauncis. And he saide well in felynge membres, 
for synowes beþ nou3t iplaunted or sette to grustles ne to bones 
neyþer to corny flesche. And it semeth þat þai beeþ iplaunted to 
þe tieþe, as he saide in þe 6 parte of þe forseide allegged book. 
Alle þe synowes forsoþe spryngen of þe brayne by hemself or 
by þe nuke, þat is his vicarye, and beeþ þere ischewed openly. 
And here-yn accordeþ þe comune scole of philosofres and of 
leches. And some spryngeþ of þe former partie of þe brayne, and 
suche synowes beþ, as þat partie is, softer and redier to 3eue felyng. 
And some forsoþe spryngeþ of þe hynder partie of þe brayne and 
passeþ downe fro þe nuke, and soche beþ harder and to mevynge 
more openliche iknowe. 
 
And wheþer felynge and mevynge beeþ iborne by oo synowe or 
by dyuerse, hit semeth þat Galien holdeþ herewiþ, in þe firste book 
of Inward Þinges and in þe fourþe book of Maladyes, þat somtyme 
þay beþ iborne by oon and somtyme by dyuerse. And þat same 
holdeþ oure scole of Mountpiler. Þis matere is harder to fynde 
|P_35 
wheþer þe forsaide þinges beþ iborne substancialy or rotably, 
wherfore it is best to late it slepe. 
 
Wheþer so þat it be, þere beeþ 7 peyre of synowes þat menely 
springen of þe brayn and 30=ti= þat spryngen by the myddel of 
þe nuke and one withoute felowe þe whiche spryngeþ by þe ende 
of þe bony parties, as Haly Abbas setteþ in þe secounde of þe 
firste parte of þe Book of Real Disposicioun. 
 
Ligamentis or bondes beþ of kynde of synowes; neuerþelatter 
þai spryngen of þe bones. Wherof beeþ 2 maneres: some byndeþ 
þe bones wiþynne, and some byndeþ al þe ioynte [\f. 12ra\] wiþoute. 
So saide Galien in þe 12 book of þe Profite of Particles, þe firste 
chapitle. Þe articulacioun or ioynynge of boones beeþ comprehendid 
in a circuite or compasse with strong ligamentes or bondes 
and with weyker or febler. 
 
Coordes beeþ also of þe kynde of synowes, and moreouer, for, 
as ligamentes beeþ mene bytwene synowes and bones, so beeþ 
cordes bytwene ligamentis and synowes. Þay spryngen of the 
brawnes, and of synowes þai take felynge and movynge, by þe 
whiche membres beþ imeued. And þogh þai be rounde (as it is 
saide) when þay passeþ out of þe brawnes, þay beeþ made larger, 
when þay come to þe makynge of ioyntes. Þai beeþ isette forsoþe 
in þe compasse of a lyme so þat þe ynnermore coordes draweþ the 
membre and þe vttermore forsoþe schoueþ it forth. And neuerþelasse, 
when þat oon draweþ, þat oþer slakeþ. And þerfore by 
kyttynge of þe vttermore coorde, þe bendynge is iloste, and by 
kyttynge of þe ynnermore, þe schouing forþ. Thus putteth 
Galien in þe firste book and in þe 12 of þe Profite of Particles or 
Lymmes. 
 
[}The 4 chapitle is of þe anothomie of veynes and arteries.}] 
Thogh veynes and arteries, after þe entent of Galien in þe 
16 book of þe Profite of Particles, dyuersen as at þe bygynnynge, 
for the veynes spryngen of þe lyuer and þe arteries of þe 
herte, and in some places a veyne is parted from an arterie, as in 
þe open arme and in þe mervaylouse nette, neuerþelatter none 
arterie is ifounde wiþoute a veyne. Thai haue as þogh it were 
comunynge and like departynge in þe remenaunt of þe body. 
|P_36 
And for þat, it suffisith to a cirurgien to make speche of hem 
togedre, and so dede Galien in þe forseide allegged place. 
What forsoþe is veyne, for it is a place of norschinge blood, and 
what forsoþe is an arterie, it is knowen to alle men, for it is þe 
place of spiritual blood. Þese vessellis forsoþe, in als mykel as þey 
[\f. 12rb\] beeþ sprongen of here principles, þay beeþ forkede. And 
oo party gooþ vpward and anoþer dounward, and eyþer parte is 
braunched, and in braunchynge þay beeþ ladde to þe vttermeste 
parties of þe body to norisshe and to queken alle þe membres. The 
particuler veynes þe whiche bryngeþ in perile in þe emoroydes by 
here gretenesse schall be saide in þe anothomye of grete membres. 
 
[}The 5 chapitle is of þe anothomie of bones, of cartilages, of 
nayles and of here.}] 
The bones schal laste be anothomysede, for þei beeþ in the 
depnesse of þe body; wherof þe bones beþ the hardeste lymes 
of all þe body. And þay beeþ þe foundament and þe haldynge vp 
of alle oþer lymes, and neuerþelatter þat wiþ þat some bones beþ 
to þe kepynge and defendynge of þe ynner membres, as þe brayne 
panne, þe breste and þe bakke. Þere beeþ bones forsoþe in oure 
body, after þat þei beeþ wel accomptede, 248, wiþoute sizamina 
and þe bone of þe lauerok, in þe whiche þe tonge is igrounded. 
 
The bones of þe body receyuen manyfolde dyuersitees at the 
nombre and schappe. Some by þe resoun of itself and oþer by 
resoun of ioyntes hauen in hemself dyuerstee, for some beeþ 
marwy and some bones haþ þat. Also some ben right or euen, and 
some beeth croked. Some also beeþ grete, and some smale. Alle 
bones forsoþe beeþ gretter at þe ioynte þan aboute þe myddel. 
And by resoun of þe ioyntes, þai haue dyuerstees, for some haaþ 
addiciouns entrynge, and some haþ voydenesses receyuynge, and 
some bones haþ boþe, and some haþ neyþer. Some bones forsoþe 
haþ þe addiciouns, as þe tieþ, and some haþ sawyng addiciouns, 
as þe brayne panne, and some bones haþ knotty addiciouns in 
eyþer hede, as vlna (i. þe boon þat streccheþ fro þe elbow to þe 
hande) and coxa (þat is a bone of þe legge). And some bones beeþ 
pytty, as þe bones þat hatte focilia, and some beeþ eyþer, as þe 
fyngres. Whiche bones forsoþe þat wanteþ [\f. 12va\] eyþer, þai beeþ 
|P_37 
i-ioyned knyttingly. And soche bones hauenge þese roundenessis 
and pittes maken propirly a ioynte, to þe whiche vnioyntynge 
happeþ propreliche; to oþer boones forsoþe, partynge. 
 
A cartilage or grustel is as it were of þe kynde of a bone; neuerþelatter 
it is softer þan þe bones. And it is made for to fulfille þe 
defaute of þe bone, as in þe ey3e liddes, in þe nose þirles and in þe 
ere, and þat þe ioynynge of bones be made bettre wiþ þinges next 
to hym, as in þe brest bone, in þe hepe bones, and in þe vttermeste 
parties of ham þat þay be nou3t made in þe vttermeste parties of 
membres to take the bettre. 
 
The heeres forsoþe beeþ made to makynge faire and to purgynge. 
 
[}The secounde doctrine is of compownede and propre 
membres. 
The firste chapitle is of þe anothomye of the potte of þe 
heuede.}] 
The anothomye ispedde of simple membris and of comune to 
al þe body, it is to come to þe anothomye of singuler and compowned 
membres. And þogh as it is aforsaide þat some membres 
beþ more and some lasse, neuerþelasse of anothomye of hem schal 
be treted in 8 chapitles after þe dyuysioun of þe more membres, 
for in þat suche a dyuysioun is more sensible and open and wiþ 
that þe manere of lechynge is varied after þat. 
 
Neuerþelatter it schal bygynne here at þe hede, nameliche at þe 
brayne and at þe potte conteynynge it, and þat for it is þe place 
and dwellynge of þe resonable soule, as Galien saide in De Vtilitate 
Particularum in þe 9 book, þe 4 chapitre, and in þe firste book of 
Kepynge of þe Helþe, þe 9 chapitle. Þe same þing is hadde in þe 
thridde book of Gouernaunce of Scharpe þinges. 
 
Aboute þe potte of þe heed of it, þo 9 þinges beþ to be enquered 
some beþ aboue, by Alisaundre þe Expositour in þe Book of 
Sectes, the whiche beþ sou3t in euery membre, þat is to say: 
helping, posicion, colligance, [\f. 12vb\] quantite, figure, substaunce 
complexioun, nombre of þe parties and sekenessis. 
|P_38 
Þe potte of þe heed, after þe Philosophre, is saide þe heery party, 
in þe whiche the membres of lyf beeþ conteynede, and in þat semeth 
his helpynge. His posicioun forsoþe and sy3te is in þe hyest place 
of al þe body. Wheþer for þe ey3en or wherfore, a cirurgien haþ 
not to considre. The colligance is open, for with þe face and the 
nekke. After Haly Abbas in þe 3 sermone partis prime, lacertes 
beþ double, movyng þe heed. Eyþer kynde of ham properly moueþ 
the hede, hauynge bygynnynge, wiþoute oþer, behynde þe eres til 
þai come to þe furcles. Þe secounde forsoþe is comune to þe hede 
and to þe nekke, of þe whiche þinges it schal be saide in þe nekke. 
 
Þe quantite of þis potte is of more capacite, while þat þe brayne 
in a man is more þan in oþer beestis of euen quantite. The schap 
þerof is rounde, in eyþer partie li3tliche compressede, and after 
þat it byhoueþ to be made gybbose or bougy as to the hyndermore 
parties and furþermore, in 2 Tegni. Þe cause of þis figure saide 
Oalien and in þe 8 book of Profite of Membres in þe laste chapitle 
saue oon. Of alle figures, he saiþ, is it most perfite and moste able 
to take, of all figures hauynge euen quantite. Þe substaunce also 
of it schal seme to be bony and with pannycles and marrowy, and 
þe complexioun þerof is colde by þe noumbre of þe parties of it. 
 
The parties forsoþe of þe potte of þe hede beþ 10 or 11 (after 
Auicen in his Canoun, libro 3=o=, capitulo primo), þat is to say, 
5 conteynynge and als manye conteyned. First wiþoute beeþ heeres 
and after þe skyn, þan brawny flesche, þan a grete pannycle, after 
forsoþe the brayne panne. Folwyngliche þere beeþ wiþynne: firste, 
dura mater and pia mater, þan þe substaunce of þe brayne; after 
forsoþe vnder the brayn comeþ a3en pia mater and dura and laste 
þe mervailouse nette, [\f. 13ra\] þan þe boon þat is þe base or 
foundement of þe brayne and þe plauntynges of synowes spryngynge 
fro þe same boon. Of þe whiche þinges it is to be saide by 
ordre. 
 
Of heeres, skynne and of brawny flesche, it is saide inow aboue. 
Of þe grete pannycle, þe whiche Galien clepeþ pericraneum, þe 
whiche helpeþ all þe brayne panne, it is to wete þat it is nervouse 
|P_39 
or synowy. And it springeþ of dura mater, and it is ibounde with 
ligamentis, synowes and wiþ veynes entring and goyng out by þe 
byndynge togidre of þe brayne panne. Folwyngliche a bone is 
ifounde aboue, þat is cleped craneum, þe brayne panne, and is 
nou3t ordeyned of a contynue bone, but of 7 peces towchyng, for 
when þat hurtyng schulde happe in oon, it schulde not passe to 
anoþer. And þai beeþ ioyned togedre wiþ sawy byndinges þat þe 
vapoures schal mowe passe out fro þe brayne. 
 
The firste of þe bones of þe potte of the hede is fro þe former 
partie and it is cleped þe coronal, þe whiche endureþ fro þe myddes 
of þe paþes or weies to þe byndinge or seem ouerþwarte þe brayne 
panne. And þeryn beeþ þe holes of þe ey3en and þe colatories of 
þe nose þirles, iparted by a manere bony addicioun in þe manere 
of an hennes creste, from þe whiche the cartilage is enplaunted 
partynge the nose þirles. Neuerþelatter it is to wete þat þe cornal 
is somtyme founden deuyded, wiþ þe commissure or seem in þe 
myddes of þe forhede transuersali, þe whiche is ofte tymes founden 
in wommen. 
 
Þe secounde bone is of þe hynder and is cleped þe hatrelle and 
is sperred togidre by a manere commissure or seem discendynge 
forþrightly in þe manere of a clene lettre, a cyfre of 7. And it is 
harde and þorled withynneforth, wherby nucha discendith fro þe 
brayne by þe myddes of þe rygge bone to þe ende of þe bakke. 
 
The 3 and þe 4 beþ in myddes by þe sides, and þay beeþ icleped 
parietales. And þay beeþ dyuyded by a manere commissure after 
þe lengþe of þe [\f. 13rb\] potte and by þe two forsaide commissures 
or seemes vnto þe bone of the eeres, and þai beeþ foure-square. 
 
The 5 and þe 6 beþ cleped þe stony bones, for þai beeþ harde. 
And þai beeþ also cleped mendosa (i. þe foule bones), for þay beeþ 
ioyned squamousely wiþ þe bones þat beþ cleped parietales. In 
þe whiche beeþ þe hooles of þe eeren and þe tetely addiciouns of 
þe purgynge places. And þay beþ ladde downe after þe lengþc 
of þe forsaide parietales fro þe commissure of þe lauerok boon to 
þe myddes of þe bones of þe temples. 
 
Þe 7 bone hatte paxillare or basillare, þat is fermynge and 
susteynynge alle the forsaide boones as a wegge aboue the palate. 
And þeryn beeþ hooles and many spongiositees to purgen grete 
superfluytees. And wiþ þat it haþ harde substaunce. 
 
Þher beeþ þerfore 7 bones of þe potte of þe hede, and so þai 
|P_40 
beeþ inoumbred in þe hedes of dede men, soden and twynned wiþ 
boylinge water. Also so nombreþ hem Galien xi=o= De Vtilitate 
capitulo 2=o=. And moreouer he moueþ two bones of bregmatis, þe 
whiche beeþ conteyned al aboute of two harde and þikke bones 
and a bone byhynde and byfore in þe whiche þe bones of þe temples 
beþ applied. Þe seuenþe is þe bone basillare þat is sette somewhat 
after þe roof of þe mowth, and some of þe ouermeste of þe cheke, 
some forsoþe beeþ sette in boþe sides of þe heed to þe likkenesse 
of a wegge. 
 
Of þe whiche it semeth þat William and Lamfranque and also 
Henry sawe euel þe anothomye, for þey seien þe bone paxillare to 
be vnder þe lauerok bone and be one of þe bones of þe nekke. And 
þai saien also þe stony boones to be putte to aboue þe parietal 
bones and nou3t touchynge þe brayne, neyþer to be of þe principales, 
whos contrarie is trewe. 
 
It folweþ therfore þat þere beeþ seuene principal boones conteyning 
þe brayne. Ther beeþ neuerþelatter some oþer smale bones 
nou3t principales for some helpynges, as þe bone of þe creste, 
[\f. 13va\] twynnynge or dyuydinge þe clensinges of þe nose þirles 
wiþin þe coronale, and þe bones paris, þe whiche be and not of 
þe potte. And some bones beeþ cleped aculea and some claualia 
vnder þe boon of þe eeres, in þe whiche þe brawnes or cordes 
opening þe iawe beeþ plaunted and made faste. And so nombreþ 
Haly Abbas in þe sermoun of þe secounde partie of þe firste book 
of Real Disposicioun in þe chapitre of assignacioun of þe bones of 
þe heed. And for þat he saide: Alle þe bones forsoþe þat beeþ in 
þe brayne panne beþ 15. He vnderstode of þe bones hauynge 
verray commissoures (i. sawy seemes), þe whiche he putte þree. 
Þogh þere were oþer twoo, oone in eyþer side, hauynge squamouse 
and foule commissures, forsoþe he denyede nou3t, for he vnderstood 
þat in þe ende of þe chapitle vnder þe bones of paris. And 
sufficen þese of þe anothomye of the brayne and by consequent of 
þe 5 particles conteyned wiþoute. 
 
Thow schalt noght mowe forsoþe determyme þe parties conteynede 
withynne to þe ey3e but 3if þe brayne panne be deuyded 
wiþ some sawe after the roundenesse. And þan þe ouer partye left 
|P_41 
vp, þe firste þing þat cometh is dura mater and pia mater. And 
þai beeþ two faire pannicles, one of þe parte of þe brayne panne, 
anoþer of þe parte of þe brayne, wrappynge and couerynge al þe 
substaunce of þe brayne. Of dura mater spryngeþ perycraneum 
by commissures. Of pia mater norisshynge is 3it in þe brayne. 
And veynes and arteries comeþ to ham wiþynneforthe by the holes 
of þe ynner bones and fro withouteforþ by þe commissures of þe 
ouer bones. 
 
From þens folweþ vnder ham þe substaunce of þe brayne, and 
it is softe and white, of a rounde schappe, wiþ outeclosid addiciouns 
þe whiche beeþ in it. And þe dyndymacioun of it after þe lengþe 
fro þe myddes to þe former partie beþ double and sensytyues 
orgones and many oþer instrumentis, [\f. 13vb\] þat if one of hem 
be hurte, þe oþer may be kepte or serued, 8 De Vtilitate. 
 
The brayne after þe lengþe haþ þre ventrycles or wombes, and 
eueriche wombe haþ two partes, and in euery parte is organyzed 
a vertue. In þe firste parte of the former ventricle, þe commune 
witte is assignede; in þe secounde, þe vertu ymaginatyf. In þe 
myddel ventricle is sitede þe vertu cogitatif (i. þinkynge) and 
resonable; in þe hyndermore forsoþe, þe vertu seruatyf (i. kepynge) 
and memoratif (i. hauing in mynde). And among þise ventricles 
þe former is þe more, þe myddel is lasse, and þe hyndermeste is 
mene. And from oon to anoþer beþ wayes by þe whiche spirites 
passen. And in þe former ventricle beeþ tetely addiciouns, in þe 
whiche þe witte of smellynge is founded. And from it spryngen 
for þe more partie 7 payre of felynge synowes, þe whiche beþ 
ladde to þe ey3en and to þe eres, to þe tonge and to þe stomak and 
to oþer membres, as it schal be saide. And 3e may see how þe 
byginninges and þe holes of ham passen and whiche way and how 
þai fallen in, noght bare but wrapped in pannycles. Knowe þou 
aboute þe myddel ventricle a place cleped lacuna ad vermuformis 
and anchaformys, fillynge þe glandulouse flesche. And þe mervaylouse 
nette is sytede vnder the pannicles, wouen oonly wiþ arteries, 
comynge fro the herte, in þe whiche spiritus animalis is made by 
trauayle of þe spirit vitalis. 
 
Byholdynge laste how nuka, or the marowe of þe bakke, is 
|P_42 
sprongen fro þe hyndermore partie of þe brayne, and nou3t bare, 
but wrapped in 2 pannycles as þe brayne is, in passinge downe by 
þe myddes of þe bak bones vnto þe ende of þe bakke, of þe whiche 
spryngen principaly þe movynge synowes, as it schal be saide 
ynnermore. It is forsoþe like to þe brayne, soþely parte of it is 
seyne. And þerfore his diuisiouns beþ as of the [\f. 14ra\] brayne, 
as Galien saiþ in 12=o= De Vtilitate Particularum, capitulo 12=o=. And 
so þe anothomye is ispedde of the potte of þe hede and of his 
partes as to 6 þinges þe whiche beeþ sou3t in hit. 
 
It longeþ now to see of þe sekenessis. Þe potte of þe hede may 
suffre woundes, apostemes and euel complexions. Of the whiche 
þinges it semeþ þat woundynges persynge all þe brayne panne beeþ 
perilouse, and more þat touchen þe webbes of þe brayne, and 3it 
more þat towchen þe substaunce of þe brayne. Ouer þat, the 
operaciouns aboute þe commyssures beþ suspecte of fallynge of 
dura mater aboue pia mater and of þristynge of þe brayne. 
 
Alle þe insciciouns or kyttynges of the hede schal be made after 
þe goynge of þe heeres, for so gone þe muscles or brawnes. Thay 
3euen a propre manere of byndynge for þe rowndenesse, as it schal 
be saide wiþinforþe. 
 
[}The 2 chapitle, of þe anothomye of the face and of his 
particles.}] 
The particles of þe face beeþ the forheed, þe browes, þe ey3en, 
the nose þirles, þe eeren, þe temples, þe chekes, þe mowþe 
and þe iowes with here tieþ. Þe forhede conteyneþ but a skynne 
and brawny flesche, for þe bone þat is vnder is of þe coronal, þe 
whiche is left vp after þe ouer table, and his spongiosite is made 
large as þogh þer were þere a double bone, and it makeþ þe 
schappe of þe browes. The browes forsoþe beeþ fourmed to fairnesse 
and for þe ey3en, and þerfore þay beeþ worschipped wiþ 
heeres. Insciciouns (i. kyttynges) aboute þise particles schal be 
made after þe lengþe of þe body, for so gooþ þe muscle þe whiche 
moueþ þe browes, but nou3t after þe wryncles. 
 
The ey3en beeþ the instrumentis of sight, and þai beeþ sette 
wiþynne þe paþþe þe whiche is a parte of þe coronal and of þe 
bones of þe temples. Whoos bygynnynge Galien telleþ so in 10 
De Vtilitate, capitulo finali: It byhoueþ þe synowes opitikes to be 
|P_43 
persed þat þere were the waie of þe spirite and to procede fro two 
[\f. 14rb\] parties, and þat þay beeþ oned wiþynne þe brayne panne. 
And after be þai departed to eyþer ey3e from þat parte of þe 
whiche þay beeþ sprongen, nou3t in crossynge neyþer permutynge 
ham fro þe ri3t side to þe lefte, as some men haue trowed. 
 
Thay beeþ forsoþe compownede of 7 tunycles and of 3 or of 4 
humours. Of þe 7 tunycles, þe firste wiþoute is þe white and þe 
grete coniunctif, þe whiche goþ aboute al þe ey3e, outake þat 
whiche semeþ of cornea, and it spryngeþ of a pannicle couerynge 
þe brayne panne. Oþer forsoþe beeþ materially þre, goynge aboute 
al þe ey3e. And for dyuerste of coloures, varieng ham aboute þe 
myddel of þe ey3e, þat is cleped yrides (i. raynebowe), þai beeþ 
saide formaly 6: thre of þe partie of þe brayne, and 3 of wiþouteforth. 
The firste spryngeþ of dura mater, and þe ynner partie is 
cleped sclirotica and þe vttermore cornea. The secounde spryngeþ 
of pia mater, and þe ynner partie is cleped secundina and þe 
vttermore vuea, and it hath þe hole of þe balle of þe ey3e. The 
þridde tunycle spryngeþ of þe synowe optike, and þe ynner parte 
is cleped rethina, and þe vttermore aboue þe cristallyn, arania. 
And so 7 tunycles beþ formaly distincte in þe ey3e and nou3t, 
but þre after materyal contynuacioun. 
 
Of þe þre humours þe firste is þe cristallyne humour, ysette in 
þe myddes of þe ey3e, of the colour of cristal, of þe schappe of 
a hayle stoon, in þe whiche þe si3te is principally founded. After 
hym towarde þe brayne is þe glasen humour susteynynge and comprehendynge 
in þe hynder partie þe humour cristallyne. Þe whiche 
boþe beþ wrapped with þe pannycle now isaide made of þe synowe 
optik. After forsoþe in þe former partie, þe humour albugineus is 
more, comprehendid bytwene þe forsaide webbe and þe potte, the 
whiche is now isprongen of pia mater. Galien assigneþ þe fourþe 
humour and he proueþ, in place afore allegged, þe aery humour 
schynynge and al foomy. And suche a composicioun is made of 
þe ey3e in itself. 
 
Neuerþelatter it haþ mouynge synowes descendynge fro [\f. 14va\] 
þe secounde payre of synowes and 6 muscles (i. brawnes) mouynge 
itself and veynes and arteries and spongiouse flesche fulfillynge þe 
spaces aboute þe lacrimales (i. corners of þe ey3en). And he haþ 
|P_44 
next hym þe grustelly ey3e liddes determynede wip heeres, 
schyttynge þe ouermore with a muscle and openynge wiþ two 
ouerþwartynge muscles. Þe helpynge and þe maneres of þe 
whiche beeþ more specified in Ihesu Of Ey3en and in Alcoatim 
and in þe special bookes of ey3en. Neuerþelatter be þese inogh to 
a cirurgen. 
 
The schap of þe nose conteyneþ flesshy partes, bony and cartilagiouse 
(i. grustly). The fleschy parte haþ aboute þe extremytees 
of it a skynne and two brawnes. The bony parte haþ twoo recornerde 
bones, whos corner is aboue þe nose, and here loweste partes 
ioynynge ham in þat oo side by þe myddel of þe lengþe of þe nose, 
and in þat oþer side after þe chekes. The grustly parte is double: 
one withoute, þe whiche makeþ the poynte of þe nose, and anoþer 
wiþynne þe whiche parteþ þe nose þirles. The nose þirles beþ two 
holowe pipes, ascendynge to þe bones of þe collatorie where þe 
teetly addiciouns of þe brayne beeþ igadred, in the whiche is 
smellynge, and goyng doun to þe roof of þe mowth byhynde þe 
vuule. Behynde þe whiche pypes a smekely euaporacioun is drawe 
to þe forsaide places, and þe ayre cometh yn and passeþ oute to 
the longes in his tyme, and þe superfluytees of þe brayne beþ 
purged. 
 
The full grustly eeres beþ ordeyned to herynge, vppon þe stony 
bone. To þe whiche eeres by croked hooles of þe forseide bone 
comen pores or synowes of þe fifte payre of synowes of þe brayne, 
in þe whiche the heryng is. And vnder þe eeres ben glandulouse 
flesshes þe whiche beeþ þe purgynge places of þe brayne. Nyh 
þe whiche þe veynes passen þe whiche, as Lamfranque saiþ, beren 
a partie of þe mater of sparme to þe gendrynge stones, þe [\f. 14vb\] 
whiche if þay be kutte, þe gendrynge is lost. Of þe whiche Galien 
holdeþ þe contrarie, as Auicen reherseth in þe book of blood 
laste. 
 
The temples, þe cheekes and the cheke bones beeþ þe partes 
asydehalf þe face, and þay conteynen in ham brawny flesshe wiþ 
veynes and arteries and bony partyes. Muscles of þose parties 
beeþ many. Firste þere beþ 7 conteynynge þe chekes of þe ouer 
lippes, and after Auicen, þai comen fro þe furcle and fro þe ynner 
|P_45 
parties. Þanne þere beeþ 12, after Haly Abbas, þe whiche mouen 
þe neþer iowe: some of ham in openynge, þe whiche comen fro 
þe place of þe nayly bones fro þe partie of þe eeres; some in 
schettynge, þe whiche discenden fro aboue in passyng vnder þe 
pitte of þe bones of þe temples. And þai be icleped þe brawnes of þe 
temples and þai beeþ ful noble and felynge, þe hurting of þe whiche 
is full perilouse, and for kynde haþ ordeyned wisely þe forsaide pytte 
in þe bones of þe temples for to kepe ham. Þere beeþ also oþer 
muscles for to make softe and for to chewe, and þay comen fro þe 
apples of þe cheke bones. To alle þise muscles comen synowes 
of þe þridde payre of synowes of þe brayne. Þere beeþ also wiþ 
þise many veynes and arteries, moste aboute þe temples and þe 
corneres of þe ey3en and ayþer lippe. 
 
The bony partes of þe forsaide parties beþ manye: first, þe bones 
of þe chekes. Þogh þay seme but twoo, ioyned vnder þe nose, 
neuerþelatter þere beeþ 9, as Galien saiþ. There beeþ also two 
bones of þe temples, þe whiche in makynge oo partie of þe pathþe 
and þe apply schewynge aboute þe chekes, þai leden forth a 
manere addicioun toward þe addicioun of stony bone, in ordeynynge 
þe forseide pitte vnder þe whiche þe muscles of þe temples passen 
and beþ kepte. Þere beeþ also bones of þe neyþer iowe, of þe 
whiche Galien saith in xi=o= capitulo penultimo: Of þe lowest parties 
forsoþe of the [\f. 15ra\] cheke a bone haþ only in itself oo dyuisioun, 
noght alwaie ischewed after þe vttermeste of þe berde, þat he saiþ 
is made for dyndymacioun. And he haþ in þe extremytees a 3okkynge 
togedre iputte to al aboute toward þe muscle of þe temples, 
thenontes and verbyformes icleped openynges. 
 
Folwyngliche it is to come to þe particles of þe mowthe, þe 
whiche beeþ 5: þe lippes (of þe whiche it is saide), þe tieþ, the 
tonge, þe palate and þe vuule. The tieþ forsoþe beeþ of þe kynde 
of bones, þogh þai be saide to haue felynge, after Galien in 6=o= 
De Vtilitate. Neuerþelatter þat is by resoun of some synowes 
goynge downe fro þe þridde payre to þe roote of ham. Þay beeþ 
at þe moste 32=ti=, þat is to say 16 in eyþer iowe (þogh þat in some 
men is nou3t ifounde but 28), þat is to say: þe 12 euene tieþ and 
2 four-cornerde and 2 tuskes, 8 grynderes and 2 caysales. And þay 
haue rootes isette in the iowes: some oon, some two, some þre, 
some foure. Þe helpynges of þe whiche ben knowen. 
|P_46 
Þe tonge is a fleschy particle, softe and spongiouse, imade 
of many synowes, ligamentis, veynes and of arteries, ordeyned 
principali for þe taste, 3euynge profitablenesse to speke and to 
gouerne þe mete in the mowth. To hym comen tastynge and 
mouynge synowes of þe 4=te= and of þe 6=te= payre. He haþ forsoþe 
9 muscles, the whiche spryngen of þe arwely addicioun and fro 
þe bone vnder þe tonge. And vnder it beþ glandulouse flesshes in 
þe whiche ben two mowþes wherby þe spatle goþ oute. Þay beeþ 
ordeyned as his matresse and moysting place. Byhynde þe tonge 
toward þe palate beþ þe chekes and wales and þe hyngynge vuule, 
to make redy þe ayre to here helpynge. The palate forsoþe is 
cleped al þe ouer parte of þe mowþe, and it is folden wiþ his 
parties in a manere pannycle of þe stomak and of þe wesaunte. 
 
And be þise inow of þe parties of þe face. Þay may suffre many 
and dyuerse [\f. 15rb\] sekenessis, to þe curacioun and pronosticacioun 
of þe whiche þe forsaide þinges helpen moche. 
 
[}The 3 chapitle, of þe anothomye of þe nekke and of þe 
parties of the bak.}] 
NO man vnknoweþ what þing þe nekke is and whiche is his 
place and fastnynge, þat it is made principally by helpe of þe 
trache arterie, folwyngliche by þe helpe of oþer particles ascendynge 
and descendynge by it, as it is conueniently schewed in 8=o= De 
Vtilitate Particularum. 
 
There beth forsoþe in þe nekke double parties: conteynynges, 
þe whiche kepen propreliche þe nekke, and conteyned, þe whiche 
passen by hit. Þe conteynynge parties beþ þe skyn, flesshes, 
muscles, ligamentes and bones. The conteynede beeþ icleped þe 
trache, cleped þe wesaunte or þe mowthe of þe stomak or mery, 
or þe þrote, of synowes, veynes and arteries and a partie of þe 
nuke or of þe mary of þe bakke. Þe anothomye of þe whiche say 
we by ordore, bygynnynge at trachea as at þe principal. 
Þe anothomye ispedde and þe þrote or þe nekke departed byfore 
after þe lengþe, first schal appere þe trache (i. þe þroteful arterie), 
þe whiche is þe way of þe ayre to þe longe, passynge fro it to þe 
þrote or to þe wesaunt, made of many grustly rynges not fulfilled, 
ioyned to þe mouth of þe stomak, ifastned and bounden wiþ 
a strong pannycle and li3t. 
|P_47 
Þan byhynde þat, aboue þe spondyles, is ysophagus (i. þe 
wesaunt), þe whiche is þe way of þe mete goynge fro þe þrote, 
persynge þe mydrede vnto þe wombe or þe stomak. And it is 
made of two halky tunicles wiþynne contynued wiþ an vttre 
fleschy skynne of the mowþe, þe whiche forsoþe beþ contynued 
wiþ the skynnes of þe wombe. 
 
Aboue þise two wayes fro þe party of þe mowthe is gula, epiglotoun, 
or þe þrote, þat I acounte al for oon of þis tyme. And it is 
a ful grustly particle, made to be þe instrument of þe voyce and 
þe keye of þe þrote in þe tyme of swolowynge, medlynge a manere 
[\f. 15va\] addicioun schape like a tonge, þe whiche is in oon of his 
partyes. Þe whiche forsoþe is made of 3 cartilages, aboute þe 
whiche 20=ti= muscles beþ sette, mouynge all and euery partie in 
ascendynge and descendynge and in makynge of oþer movementes, 
as it is saide in þe Book of þe Voyce and Of Open Movynges. 
 
Than þou schalt considre double synowes, descendynge to þe 
stomak and to þe bowels, croked a3eyne for þe felynge and turnynge 
a3en to wiþynne aboue next þe þroote, for þe voyce. Also þow 
schalt considre þe grete veynes and arteryes þe whiche gone 
vpward, ibraunched nygh þe furcle, by þe sides of þe nekke to þe 
ouer parties, þe whiche beþ cleped þe depe guidege and appopletice 
or subetales, þe kyttynge of þe whiche is ful perilouse. 
 
Folwyngliche by grace of þe conteynynge parties and makynge 
þe nekke, þe whiche beeþ þe skynne, fleisshes, muscles, ligamentis 
and bones or 7 lynkes or ioyntes, by þe general anothomye iseyne 
of þe rygge bones and of al þe bakke. Þe spondyle is a bone conteynynge 
þe bak, ipersed in þe sides, by þe whiche synowes gone 
oute, hauynge many puttynges to, ascendynge and descendynge 
and in makynge withouteforþ þe rigge bone, passynge nameliche 
by þe menes of þe bak. 
 
The bak is as it were a talwy or a fleschy place byhynde, fro þe 
hede vnto þe foundement, ordeyned of manye and dyuerse linkes 
yche after oþer to defende þe nuke. Galien saiþ, 12=o= et 13=o= De 
Vtilitate Particularum, þat in þe bak beþ 4 grete partes, þat is to 
saye: þe nekke, þe spawdes, þe lendes, and it is icleped of some 
men þe holy bone and of some men þe large bone. 

|P_48 
After þe nekke þere beeþ 7 spondiles or lynkes, and after þe 
spawdes 12, and after þe lende 5, and after þe holy bone 4. Þere 
beeþ þerfore 24 verrey spondiles and 4 of þe holy bone and þre 
of þe tayle bone, þe whiche forsoþe beþ nou3t spondyles but like 
to ham as vikaries. For the firste þre beeþ ful grete, and þay haue 
[\f. 15vb\] noþer echynges ne holes in þe sides but tofore, and þai 
beeþ ful grustly, and nameliche þe laste, makyng hamself smalle 
to þe manere of a tayle. And so at þe moste þere beeþ 30=ti= spondiles 
or lynkes. And if a payre of synowe spryngynge fro þe nuke (i. þe 
mary of þe bak bone) passe by eueriche spondyle, þere schal be 
30=ti= of synowes of þe nuke and oo synowe wiþoute felawe, þat 
spryngeþ of þe laste partie þerof. And if þere springe of þe brayne 
7, þe summe of synowes schal be 30=ti=, as it was seide aboue of 
synowes of þe hede and of þe kynde of þe nuke. Ther beþ also 
ouer þat some brawny flesshes liggynge after þe lengþe of þe forsaide 
bak in þe sides of þe spondyles as þay were a matresse to þe 
synowes, þe whiche beeþ icleped þe loynes. And þerwiþ is a 
pannycle bynding all þe bak bones as is aboue þe brayne panne 
and oþer grete bones. 
 
Ther beþ þerfore in þe nekke 7 spondyles by whos sides ipersed 
passen out 7 payre of synowes fro þe parte of þe nuke þe whiche 
passeþ þere, þe whiche beren felynge and movyng to þe schuldres 
and to þe armes and to some parties of þe hede and of þe same 
nekke. The flesshes of þe nekke beþ þrefolde: þat beeþ propurliche 
icleped þe longe hatrelles liggynge (as it is isayde) full brawny 
nygh þe spondiles, of þe whiche þe tenauntes beþ made þat moven 
the heed and þe nekke (þe whiche beeþ 20=ti= in noumbre, as Galien 
saiþ), and flesshes fulfillynge þe voyde places. 
 
The comune ligamentes byndynge þe heed wiþ þe nekke and 
wiþ þe spawdes beþ manye. In þe former partie beþ two grete 
ligamentes discendynge from vnder þe eeres to þe furcle. In þe 
hyndermore partie forsoþe beeþ oþer more ligamentis byndynge 
þe spondiles of þe bak, goyng downe in þe sides to þe spawdes and 
oþer moste membres, so þat þe muscles, þe tenouns and þe ligamentis 
stonden in þe circuite or compasse of þe nekke, makynge 
a rowndeness, bowyng and liftyng vp and wrappynge [\f. 16ra\] 
|P_49 
aboute þe nekke and þe hede. And withoute þise, it is not possible 
forsoþe to make be open couplynge, secundum Galienum vbi 
supra. Of the whiche þo 6 or 7 þinges þe whiche beþ sou3t in euery 
membre. 
 
It is now to see of þe sekenesses. Þe nekke may suffre many 
sekenesses, boþe in hym and in his contentes, as woundes, 
vnioyntinges and apostemes. And alle þoo beeþ perilouse. It semeþ 
also þat kyttinges in it schal be made after þe lengþe, for soche is 
þe goynge of his parties. It 3eueþ his owne manere of byndinge, 
as it schal be saide wiþynneforth. 
 
[}The 4 chapitle, of þe anothomye of þe schuldres and of þe 
armes or of þe grete hondes.}] 
AFter þe nekke folweþ þe ovene or þe brest bone, but for þat 
the schuldres beeþ isette aboue þe ouer parties þerof, and 
by consequent þe armes, þerfore of ham firste it is to be saide. 
Þe schulder blade, þe spawde and þe schuldre, be þis itaken al for 
oon in þis present. Whiche þinges forsoþe þise been and whiche 
is here place and fastnyng now it appereþ. Þise þinges forsoþe 
beeþ to þe makynge and defendynge of þe holwe membres, in 
primo De Vtilitate per totum. The Creatour or Maker apparaillede 
man wiþ handes and wiþ resoun in stede of armour. Aristotel forsoþe 
saide wel, for he saide þe hond bifore þe holow membres and 
resoun bifore craftes. 
 
The parties forsoþe makynge þise beþ the skyn, flesche, veynes, 
arteries, synowes, muscles, cordes, lygamentis, pannycles, grustilles 
and bones. Of þe whiche by ordre it is to be seyn, and firste in þe 
spawde, in þe whiche what is þe skynne and þe flesche, it is saide 
aboue. The muscles and þe coordes movyng þe arme, descendynge 
fro þe nekke and þe breste, passen by it. And þai, takyng and 
wrappynge þe ioyntour of þe elbowe or þe helpyng bone, be inplanted. 
The synowes beeþ drawe oute of þe marye of þe nekke. 
The veynes and þe arteries beþ braunched from wiþynneforth, as it 
is isaide. And, for soche in þe schuldres beþ nou3t mykel schewed, 
of ham þe speche is made schort. 
 
[\f. 16rb\] Of bones it is to wite þat þai bene two: þe firste is þe 
|P_50 
schulder bone of þe partie of þe bak. The secounde bone is þe 
furcle on þe breste half. The schulder bone is like as it were of 
a reeme or a table, for it is brode and þenne on þe bak half wiþ 
a manere of þynne schewynge by þe myddel. And in þe ioynte 
half it is somwhat long and rounde in the manere of an hefte, wiþ 
þre echynges in þe ende. The firste is þe pitte, þe whiche is in þe 
myddes, resceyuynge þe hede of the elbowe. The secounde is aboue, 
croked and scharpe in þe manere of a ravenes bille. The þridde is 
in ouer half, more croked in þe manere of an ancre. 
 
The furcle bone is rounde, and it is made faste in a manere of 
holowenesse in þe ouer partie of þe breste bones. And it haþ two 
schotynges oute: oon spredeþ to oo schuldre, and anoþer to þat 
oþer schuldre. And it byndeþ and fastneþ þe two croked echynges 
þat þe pitty echynge in þe myddel holde þe more stably þe hede 
of þe elbowe in þe ioynte. 
 
Tho echynges forsoþe beþ none oþer bones fro þe schulder 
bone, as Lamfranque and Henry sayen, but þai beeþ substancial 
parties þerof. And experience techeþ þat þis is trewe. And so 
affermeþ Galien 13=o= De Vtilitate Particularum, capitulo 11=o= et 12=o=, 
sayenge þat þe schulder blades by plente of extremytees helleþ þe 
schulder and fastnynge it priuely, togidre it schulde be forsoþe þe 
hillynge and þe kepyng of al the articulacioun (i. couplynge togedre) 
after þe schuldre, togedre forsoþe and to forbyd þe hede of þe arme 
to passe oute aboue. And þerwiþal it haþ þre grete fastenynge 
goyng out of þe hede of þe schuldre to þe elbowe. And in 
þe circuyte it is streyned wiþ the moste tenouns sprongen fro þe 
moste muscles (i. brawnes), comynge fro þe breste and fro þe 
schuldre, isette in þe bone of þe elbowe, mouynge hym: some forsoþe 
goyng vpward, some dounward, and some turne ham rounde 
aboute. 
 
The partie forsoþe vnder þe forsaide ioynte is icleped þe arme 
hole, þe whiche is fulfilled wiþ glandulouse flesche, in þe whiche 
is assigned þe purgynge places of [\f. 16va\] þe herte. 
 
Folowyngly it is to saye of þe arme, þat is icleped þe grete 
hand, the whiche Galien, in 2=o= De Vtilitate, capitulo 2=o=, dyuydeþ 
into þre grete partes: one forsoþe is þe elbowe, anoþer forsoþe is 
þe litel arme, and anoþer forsoþe is cleped attrachita (i. þe litel 
|P_51 
hond). And it haþ þe parties þat beeþ nempned aboue, as is skynne 
and flesche, as it is schewed of oþer. 
 
Of þe schewed arteries and veynes þe whiche beeþ founden in 
þe armes, a speche is imade togedre for þe cause aforseide. After 
forsoþe þat þay comen fro here principles in braunchynge to þe 
arme holes, þai beeþ ibraunched þere in two parties, where-of 
oo partie spredeþ to þe vtter partie of the arme and þat oþer to 
þe furþer partie. Þat spredeth wiþouteforth is braunched anone. 
And oo braunche goþ vpward byhynde þe schuldre to þe hede. 
And þat oþer in goyng downe is braunched in tweyne, wherof oon 
is dyuyded by þe arme wiþoute in many parties, and it is icleped 
þe ende of þe arme. That oþer braunche forsoþe descendith by þe 
ouer partie of þe arme, and it is schewed in þe boghte of the arme, 
and it is cleped þere cephalica. And þerof it descendiþ to þe 
hand, and it is schewed bytwene þe þombe and þe schewynge fyngre, 
and it is cleped þe eye veyne. That parte forsoþe whiche was 
departed in þe arme holes þat spredeþ to the ynner partie in 
descendynge, it is schewed in þe bou3te of þe arme, and it is cleped 
basilica (i. þe base veyne). And fro þat place it discendith to þe 
hond, and it is schewed bytwene þe myddel fynger and þe litel 
fyngre, and it is cleped saluatella. Fro þise two forsaide veynes 
when þay beeþ in þe boghte of þe arme, a comune braunche is 
braunched þe whiche appereþ in þe myddel of boþe, þe whiche is 
cleped mediana, þe myddel veyne or þe bodely. 
 
There beþ in þe arme 4 or 5 grete veynes and als many arteries 
whos kyttynge is perilous for here grete flowynge of blode. Þere 
beeþ forsoþe many [\f. 16vb\] oþer braunches of þe whiche a cirurgien 
haþ nou3t to considre for þaire litelnesse. 
 
Of synowes it is saide þat 4 notable synowes comen downe fro 
þe nuke by þe lynkes of þe nekke to eyþer arme: one byhynde, 
anoþer bifore, one aboue, anoþer byneþe. Þe whiche, departede 
by al or by hamself, in passynge by depnesse of þe body, or imedled 
wiþ brawnes, cordes and ligamentes, beren felynge and movynge 
to alle þe armes. 
 
Muscles (i. brawnes) beþ made of þe forsaide synowes, of flesche 
and of pannycles, þat is to say: þe 4 principal and grete muscles in 
þe adiutorie (i. aboute þe boghte of þe arme) movynge þe litel 
arme, and 4 þerynne movynge the litel hande, and 5 in þe hond 
movynge þe fyngres.Whos synowy cordes beþ so imade open, as 
|P_52 
it is saide aboue, and þay beþ made naked fro flesshe by 3 fynger 
brede nygh þe ioynte, and if þai be wounded þai brynge yn greet 
perile. There beeþ also in þe arme many ligamentis, þe whiche 
descenden fro þe bones and passen by ioyntes, and þai holden 
ham bounden wiþ cordes imade large, whos kyttynge is ful 
harmeful. 
 
Now laste it is to say of þe bones of þe grete hand after þe forsaide 
dyuysioun. In þe firste partie, þe whiche is cleped þe vlne 
or þe adiutorie (i. þe cubite), is a bone ful of marye and rounde at 
eyþer ende. And þe ouer roundenesse, þe whiche is one alone, 
entreþ into a box or a pytte of þe schuldre, and it makeþ þe 
schulder ioynte. The lower rowndenesse is twofolde, in þe myddes 
of þe whiche is a gree, as it were a double knotte, wherby þe cordes 
passen with þe whiche watres beþ drawen. And in þe ynner partie 
it haþ a manere litel semynge or struttynge, and byhynde it haþ 
a manere of holownesse, in þe whiche þe heed or þe croked echynge 
of þe more focyle is resceyued in þe tyme of raxynge of þe arme, so 
þat þo roundenessis entren into þe holownesses of þe fociles. And 
þai beeþ turned a3ene [\f. 17ra\] in þe tyme of schouynge forth and 
of bowynge of þe arme. 
 
And þay maken the ioynte in þe myddel of þe arme in þe whiche 
þe litel arme bygynneþ, þe whiche is þe secounde parte aforesaide. 
In þe whiche beeþ two bones icleped þe fociles, þat is to say, þe 
more, þe whiche is wiþyn, the whiche is saide to be lenger þan þat 
oþer for þe hoked echynge, and goþ toward þe litel fyngre, in 
makynge wiþouteforth a bougy semynge in þe manere of a pynne. 
Þe lesse forsoþe is aboue, and it gooþ fro þe boghte of þe arme vnto 
þe honde toward þe þombe as þogh he wolde eche in it. And in 
eyþer hede of ham beþ pittes resceyuynge þe rowndenesses. 
Toward þe cubite, þay resceyuen þe gradual roundenesses of þe 
adiutorie (i. þe elbowe) wiþ þe hoked echynge of þe forseide cubite, 
and toward þe hand, þay receyuen the roundenessis of þe bones 
of þe hande. And þay beeþ boþe gretter and ioynynge ham in þe 
ioynte, and þay beþ smaller in þe myddel, and þe more atwene, 
þat þay schulde holde þe synowes and muscles. 
 
And where þese two fociles enden and beþ fastened in ioynte 
wiþ the bones of þe hande, þere is þe ioynte made þerof, and þere 
it bygynneþ. In þe whiche beþ þre egges of bones, and þe lower 
bones beþ ioyned wiþ here roundenessis wiþ þe pittes of þe ouer 
|P_53 
bones. In þe firste egge beþ þre bones, for þe echynge of þe focyles 
is as it were aboue, holdynge þe place of a bone. In þe secounde 
egge beeþ foure bones, and in þe ouer is a boxe or holownesse in 
þe whiche þe firste bone of the þombe is fastned. And þe bones 
of þise two egges beþ schorte. In þe þridde egge beþ 4 longer bones 
þan þe oþere. The firste partie of þe two egges is cleped þe rachete, 
þat oþer partie is icleped þe pawme of þe hande. And after 
ham þe fyngres folowen, and in euery fyngre beþ þre bones, and 
þey beþ 5. 
 
Ther beþ þerfore 15 bones of þe fyngres and xi of þe hande and 
two in þe arme and one in þe elbowe. And so in al þe grete 
[\f. 17rb\] arme or þe grete hand beþ 29 bones. And so appereþ þe 
nombre of þe parties of þe forsaide membres. 
 
It is to see of þe sekenessis þe whiche may come to ham. And 
þai beeþ many, as apostemes, woundes, vnioyntynge, brekynges, 
þe pallesye. Wherfore 3e may see by here anothomye þat the 
insciciouns schal be made after þe lengþe and nou3t after þe lirkes 
or wrynkelis, for so gone þe muscles (i. brawnes). Also 3e may see 
by here anothomye þat among þe ioyntes of þese bones þe cubital 
ioynte (i. in þe welde of þe arme) is hardest to vnioynte and to 
reduce (i. sette a3eyne), and þe schulder ioynte most esy, and þe 
ioynte of þe hande is mene. Also 3e may see þe partes to þe whiche 
vnioynynge is most redely imade. 3e may also considre þat in þe 
pallesyes of thise membres, þe remedies schal be applied aboute 
þe spondiles of þe nekke, for fro ham þe synowes beþ drawen 
oute. 
 
[}The 5=te= chapitle, of þe anothomye of the breste and of his 
parties.}] 
The breste is þe arke of þe spiritual membres, and þerfore in 
ham be some conteynynge parties and somme conteynede. 
Þe conteynynge parties beeþ foure: þe skyn, brawny flesshe, þe 
tetes and þe bones. Þe conteynede parties beeth 8: þe herte, þe 
longes, pannycles, ligamentis, synowes, veynes and arteries and 
ysophagus (i. þe wesaunte). What is þe skynne and þe flesche, it 
is schewed wel inogh. 
 
It is to say of þe tetes, for þay beeþ aboue the flesche, and 
þay beþ made of white, glandulouse and spongy flesche and 
of veynes, of arteries and of synowes. And þerfore they haue 
|P_54 
knyttynge wiþ herte, þe lyuere and þe brayne and wiþ the membres 
generatyues. 
 
In spekynge schortly of muscles, after Auicen þer beþ 80=ti= or 
90=ti= muscles. And some of ham beeþ comune to þe nekke, some 
to þe schuldres and to þe spawdes, and some beeþ of þe mydrede, 
and some beeþ of þe owne breest, and some beeþ of þe ribbes, 
and some of þe bak. 
 
The bones [\f. 17va\] of þe brest beeþ þrefolde. In þe former partie 
beeþ 7, þe whiche beeþ cleped þe bones of the breste, and þai 
beeþ ful of grustles. Of the whiche, vppon þe firste toward þe 
þroote is þe foote of þe forsaide furcle receyued in a boxe. And 
vnderneþe ham in þe forcelle at þe mowþe of þe stomak is a maner 
eechyng ful cartilagyouse (i. grustly) icleped ensiforme. In the 
hynder partie toward þe bak beeþ 12 spondyles (i. lynkes of þe 
bak) by þe whiche þe nuke passeþ. Fro þe whiche nuke spryngen 
12 payre of synowes berynge felynge and mouynge to þe forsaide 
muscles. On þe side half, in eyþer side beþ 12 ribbes, þat is to say, 
7 verray or trewe ribbes and 5 false or foule ribbes, for þay beeþ 
not hole as þe forsaide, whos schappe eche man may see. And be 
þis inow of þe conteynynge parties. 
 
If þou wilt make wel þe anothomye of þe conteyned membres, 
it byhoueþ þat þou kytte þe breste after þe sides and remoue þe 
furþer partye, and þat slily for þe medyastyne, and þe entraylles 
schal appere to þe. 
 
Of þe whiche þe firste and þe moste principal is þe herte, þat 
in þe bygynnynge of þe lyf. And þerfore, after þe wordes of Galien 
6=o= De Vtilitate, it is sette in þe myddel of þe brest as a kyng and 
a lorde, nou3t bowynge to eny partye. And it is vnderstonden 
contrariliche (i. in þe myddel poynt), for as to þe lower partie 
þerof, it semeth to bowe a litel to the lefte parte for þe place of the 
lyuer, and at to the ouer partie, to þe ri3te parte þat it 3eue place to 
arteries. The schappe forsoþe of þe herte is in þe manere of a pyne 
appel iturned wiþynne, for þat þe scharpnesse is toward þe lower 
parties of þe body and þe brode þerof, þat is þe roote, toward þe 
ouer parties. 
 
The substaunce of þe herte is harde and as it were lacertouse 
(i. ful brawny), hauynge in it two ventricles (i. smale womes), þe 
|P_55 
ri3te and þe lefte, and in þe myddel a denne, as Galien seiþ. In 
þe whiche þe grete norisshynge blood is defied comynge fro þe 
lyuere, and it is made sotil and spiritual, þe whiche is byqueþed 
by þe arteries to al þe body, and principally [\f. 17vb\] to oþer principal 
membres: to þe brayne, in þe whiche in defieng it takeþ 
anoþer nature or kynde and it is made animalis (i. þe spirit or 
blood of lyf), and to the lyuer and it is made naturalis (i. þe naturel 
spirit), and to þe testicles (i. priue stones) and it is made generatyues 
(i. þe spirit of gendrynge), and to quyken and array alle þe 
oþere membres. It is forsoþe þe instrument of alle þe vertues of 
þe body and þe ful oonhede of þe soule. 
 
And þerfore þere beeþ in hym two mowþes. By þe ri3te mowth 
gooþ yn þe braunche of ascendynge veyne beryng vp þe blood fro 
þe lyuere, and it gooþ oute at þe same. Oo parte is cleped vena 
arterialis, þe wosy veyne, þe whiche gooþ to norisshe þe longes 
And þe remlaunt is braunched in ascendynge in many braunches 
vnto þe extremytees, as it is saide aboue. And vena pulsatilis, þe 
pulse veyne, goþ oute fro þe lefte mowthe. Wherof oo party goþ to þe 
lunges, þe whiche is cleped venalis, berynge stynkynge vapoures to 
lunges and ledynge bytwene ayer to cole with þe herte. And anoþer 
veyne is braunched lower and hyer, as it is saide of oþer veynes. 
 
And boue þise mowþes beeþ þre smale skynnes, openyng and 
schettynge þe entree of blood and of þe spirit in dewe tyme. And 
nygh ham beeþ two smale eeres, by þe whiche þe preparate ayer, 
arrayed of þe longes, goþ into þe herte and comeþ oute. Also 
a grustly bone is founde in it to fastne and strengþe with þe herte. 
And it is couered of a manere of strong hucche and ful of pannycles, 
icleped of Galien pycardium, to þe whiche synowes discenden as 
to oþer ynward bowels. 
 
The herte forsoþe is bounden wiþ þe lunges and susteyned and 
fastned by þe medyastyne. Of þe whiche it semeþ þat þe herte 
haþ fastnynge or accordynge wiþ alle þe membres. It semeþ also 
þat it is of so moche worþynesse þat it susteyneþ nou3t longe tyme 
passiouns. 
 
Vppon þe self herte the lunges moven to be coled. Whos 
substaunce is softe, selden, spongyouse and white. Wiþynne 
þe whiche þre kyndes of vesselles ben plaunted togedre, þat is to 
say, þe braunche of þe arterial [\f. 18ra\] veyne, þe whiche veyne 
|P_56 
springeþ (as it is saide) of þe ri3t ventricle of þe herte, and þe 
braunche of þe arterial veyne, þe whiche braunche comeþ of þe 
lefte ventricle, and wiþ ham beþ braunches of þe trache arterie 
(i. þe þropul) beryng to hym ayre for þe herte. The whiche vesselles 
forsoþe beþ departed by all þe lunges vnto þe lefte parties. The 
lunge forsoþe haþ 5 lappettes or wynges: two in þe left half and 
þre forsoþe in þe ri3t half. 
 
Byhynde þe lunge toward þe fifte spondile passeth mery (i. þe 
mowth of þe stomak) or ysophagus (i. þe wesaunt), of þe whiche 
it is saide aboue. And þere passeþ also vena concaua, þe holwe 
veyne, of þe whiche it schall be saide inward, boþe passynge by 
þe mydrede. And þere passeth also þe matere of þe veyne abhorti 
ascendynge fro þe herte. And alle þise maken a stokke wiþ trachea, 
ifilled wiþ strong pannycles and ligamentis and wiþ glandulouse 
flesche vnto þe þrote. 
 
Folowyngly þere beeþ 3 pannycles in þe brest: firste is þe 
pannycle þe whiche helleþ al þe ribbes, þat is icleped pleura. The 
secounde is þe medyastyne, þe whiche deuydeþ al þe coffre into 
þe ri3te partie and þe lefte. The þridde is þe mydrede þat deuydeþ 
al þe spirituales fro þe nutryues. And it is compowned of pleura 
and of syphac and of a cordely pannycle isprongen in the myddel 
of synowes byqueþed to hym fro þe spondiles and fro þe fleschy 
parties most nyhe þe ribbes. Of þe whiche it semeþ þat it is a 
muscle whos worchynge is to þe breeþ and helpyng to þe puttynge 
out of þe superfluytees, as Galien saiþ.
