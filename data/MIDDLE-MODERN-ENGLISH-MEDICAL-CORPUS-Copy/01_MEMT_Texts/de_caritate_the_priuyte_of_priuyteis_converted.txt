[}The secunde capitil Capitulum ij}] 
O Alysaundyr, kepe þi nobyl angelyke soule, for it was commendyd 
to þe, no3t to be dyshonestyd, but þat it schuld be gloryfyid. 
Be no3t of þe nowmbyr of onclene lyueris, ner of her kend, 
but of þe nowmbyr of wysemen. O buxum kynge, if it may be be 
ony wey, ryse no3t, ner sytte no3t, ner ete no3t, nor drynke no3t, 
nor [\f. 37v\] do vttyrly ryght no3t, with-owte þe counsel of an experte 
man in þe kunnyng of sterris. Know þer-for for certeyn, þat 
glorius God made ryght no3t in veyn nor ydil to natur, but alle be 
made of a cause prouabil, and of a reson most certeyn. For be 
þis wey and inquisycion, Plato, owr most excellent doctour, knwe 
þe partis of þingis compownyd and of contraryus qwalyteis and 
of colourys in her kendys, in comparyson to þingis compounyd, 
and be þat he had þe kunnyng of sterris formyd to deme by. Trost 
neuir in onwyse mennys seyingis, as þei þat seyne þat þe kunnyng 
of sterris is hard to be knowyn, and also þe cours of planetis, 
|P_143 
and þei sey þat no man may cum þer-by. But sqwyche pepyl þei 
knowe no3t qwat þei sey, for to þe power of mannys vndyrstondyng 
þer is no thyng hard, for alle þingys be knowabyl in vey of resun. 
And odyr folys þer be also, þat sey þat God prouydid and ordeynyd 
fro þe beginnyng euirlastyng, qwerfor þei sey þat it profytith no3t 
to know before qwat [\f. 38\] schal be-tyde aftyrward, sythyn it is so þat it 
is necessary þei schuld falle and must nedys be: qwat is wurth þan 
þe kunnyng of sterris? I ansqwer and sey, þat thow sum thyngis 
schal come necessaryly, yit if þei be knowyn be-forn þei schal be 
þe mor esyly born, and be wysdam, in maner sette a-syde. And þus 
þei be schonyd for in as myche as þei be for to come, and þat I haue 
knowyng of hem, I receyue þo chaunsys be wysdam and prouydens, 
and so þei pase with-owte ony gret heuynes or gret hurt. 
As be exampyl, qwan we se be owr syens þat wyntir schal falle of 
gret vttyr cold, and long endur, men may puruey of sqwyche stuff 
þat þei schal with-owte ony grete anoyauns scape þat wyntyr. On 
heete of þe same wyse. And qwan a derth schal falle, if men knowe 
it be-for, þei may make prouydens of qwete, of wyne, and of odyr 
thyngis necessary, so þat þei schal scape þise hard [\f. 38v\] yeris of 
hungir and nedfulnes. Þer-for it is myche wurth to know þat schal 
be-tyde, for be þat knowlech men may be war and schonne þat 
euyl þat schal falle. And also, mor specially, qwan þei se þat 
sqwyche a thyng schal be-tyde, tei may pray God, þat hath alle 
thyng in gouernanz, þat of Hys hye goodenes He wul turne fro 
hem þat euyl chaunz, or dyspose it odyr wyse. For þ[{e{] good 
Lord diffinyd neuir thyng so streytly þat be þat He dyd derogacion 
to Hys power þat He may reuoke aftir He seeth cause qwy to reuoke. 
For men may be-seche þe buxumnes of God with orysonnys, 
deuocionys and preyeris, with sacrifisis, fastyngis and elmes, and 
odyr goode dedis, axyng foryefnes of þat þei haue done amys 
forthynkyng hem of her gilt. And be thys mene almyghty God wul 
turne fro hem þat vengauns, trowbyl, or heuynes þat þei fer of. 
Lete vs þan now turne ayene to owr [\f. 39\] fyrst entente and exortacion. 
It owyth to be knowyn þat astronomy is dyuydid in to þre partis, 
þat is to sey in þe ordynacion of þe ix heuynnis and of þe speeris 
and þe dysposycion of planetis, and þe dyuision of þe sygnys, þe 
elongacion also of hem, and of þe maner of þer werkynkys. And þis 
parte of astronomy is clepyd þe syens. The secunde parte is of þe 
|P_144 
qwalyte and þe maner of knowyng þe meuyng of þe fyrmament, þe 
rysyng or þe spryngyng of þe sygnys, vppon thyngis neghyng þe 
celestyal speris or euir þei come to knowlech be vysual appeirryng. 
And þis is þe secunde parte of astronomye, or þe konnyng of 
domys. And þe thyrd parte, þe qwyche is most wurthy, specyfiith 
of thre thyngis, þat is to sey, of speris, planetis, and sygnis. Knowe 
þan certeynli þat planetis þat be fyxe, þe nowmbyr of hem is a 
thousaund and nyne and tweynti, of qwyche in a certeyn parte of 
þis boke I schal schewe þe my doctrine. 
 
[\f. 39v\] [} [{The thyrde capitil{] Capitulum iij}] 
And now fyrst and formest I schal yef þe my doctrine of 
medecynys and odyr priuyteis þat be necessary to kepyng of þi 
helth, þat thow schalt nede no leche. For þe kepyng of helth is 
bettir than ony medycine, and þis doctrine and þise secretis be 
ryght necessari to þe gouernanz of þis world. But it must be knowyn 
þat þer is no wey to do ony thyng by, or to gett ony syens, but only 
be clernes and power of vndystondyng. And þis power is no3t 
but be helth. And helth is no3t withowte equalyte of complexcion. 
And þer is no complexcion but be temperanz and equalyte of 
humoris. And glorius God hath ordeynid a mene and a remedy to 
þe temperauns of humoris and to þe conseruyng of helth, and to 
gete many odyr þingis þerby, þe qwyche God schewyd to holy 
profetis, and to ryghful men, and to sondry odyr qwyche þat 
He chase and ill[{u{]mynyd with þe spyryte of godly [\f. 40\] wysdam, and 
hath yiftid hem with þe yiftis of kunnyng. And of þise seyd men 
phylysofris had þe begynnyng and þe princehed of fylosofye, and 
men of Yinde, Peercis, Grekys, and Latynis of þise haue drawyn 
owte and wrytyn þe byginyngis and priuyteis of craftis and syensis 
lyberal, for be-cause þat in fylisofris wrytingis þer was founde no 
thyng fals ner no thyng repreuabyl, but appreuyd of wyse men. 
He trwly þat is cause of hys owne lesyng, myche mor þan schal yeue 
occasyon or cause to odyr men of lesyng, for þat thyng þat we loue 
we chese, and we seke þat thyng þat we ar purposid to knowe. 
But þu owyst to knowe, þat among alle odyr fylisofyris, glorius 
God hath inflamyd Grekys with kunnyng most specially to þe 
serchyng of syens, and to knowe þe begynnyng and grownde of 
causis and thyngis natural, and of þat we haue made remembranz 
|P_145 
in odyr placis. And nowe aftyr þe sentens of fylysofris in þis booke 
I purpose sentencyusly to procede. 
 
[\f. 40v\] [}The fourthe capitil Capitulum iiij}] 
Alle wyse men and natural philysofris acorde, seyng how man 
is made of opposytis and contrarius elementis, and of sqwyche 
humorys þat alle-wey nedyth noryschyng and fedyng and pocyonnis, 
qwyche if he fayle or lak, hys substauns must corupte. And if 
so be þat he vse þise metys and drynkys in superfluyte, doyng 
excesse, or ellis he withdrawyth hem to myche be abstynens, he 
must nedly falle into grete sekenes or febylnes. And if he vse hem 
temperatly, he schal fynde help and comfort to þe lyfe, strenght of 
body, and helth of alle hys substauns. And furthermor, þei acorde 
in one, þat he þat pasith þe dwe mene in fulnes or in voydenes, 
in slepe or in wecchyng, in meuyng or in reste, in laxing hym 
or constypacion of hys wombe, in withdrawyng or holdyng hys 
veynal blode, may not escape þe woodenes of sekenes and heuysum 
troubyl of infyrmyteis. Of alle qwyche vndyr congruent schortnes [\f. 41\] 
I yefe þe my doctrine most certeyn, of þe kendys of sekenes and 
remedyis of þo sekenessis. Alle þise wyse men þan acord þat he þat 
is war of superfluyte, and of to myche indygens or abstynens, 
kepyng equalyte and temperauns, þat manir of man þat vsyth 
þis schal perceyue and possede þe most holssum helth and lenght 
of dayis, þat is to sey lyue longe. And I trwly fond neuir no fylisofyr 
dyscordyng fro þis sentens, but þat alle þe delectabyl thyngis 
of þis world, qwedyr þei be of lustys or lykyngis, or ryches, or 
melodyis, or wurchyppys, alle be for duryng, or durabylite. He 
þanne þat desyrith to lyue and to endur longe in helth, he must 
renounce or forsake hys owne wylle, þat he hast no3t o mele or on 
etyng sone aftyr anodyr. For I hard sey of Ypocras þat he kept 
sqwyche a maner of dyete þat hys body semte febyl and i-weykyd 
þer-of, qwerfor hys dyscypyl seyd to hym, þat if he wold ete wele 
hys body schuld no3t be so febyl. To home Ypocras ansquerd, 
'Sone, I wul ete on sqwyche [\f. 41v\] wyse þat I may lyue, and no3t 
lyue forte ete, puttyng my lust in etyng rather þan in longe lyuyng'. 
Nurchyng must be dysiry[{d{] and vsyd to þat entent to durabylnes, 
to lyfe longe, and no3t to desyr longe lyfe to hawe lust of metys. 
And trwly I knw many þat lessyd of fedyng, absteynyng fro her 
appetitis, sparyng her belyis, and lyuid temperatly, dietyng 
|P_146 
þem self, and þer-for þei had heyl bodyis of bettyr dysposicion, of 
lenger lyfe, and of goode appetite, beyn and lyght in meuyng. And 
þis is experte and opyn in men of þe cuntre of Arabe and also be 
hem þat oftyn vse to go be desertys and for jorneys, þat labour, 
and ete but lyghtly. Qwerfor it is an opyn argument þat to absteyn 
fro gret etyng, and to porge þe stomak be summe labour to confort 
þe natural hete, is most chef medycyne. 
 
[}The fyfthe capytil Capitulum v}] 
O Alysaundyr, in medycine is conteynyd þe most certeyn and 
trwest lernyng, þat þe kepyng of helth stondyth [\f. 42\] in tweyn thyngis 
chefly. The fyrst is þat a man vse metys acordyng or conuenyent 
to hys age, and to þe tyme in þe qwyche he is inne, and to þe 
custum of hys natur, þat is to sey, þat he vse metys and drynkys 
with þe qwyche he hath be wunt to be norchyd with, and with 
sqwyche as þe substauns of hys body hath most be refreschyd with. 
The secunde is þat he purge hym-self of þo thyngis þat be gendyrrid 
of superfluyte and corupte humourrys, as is vryne and 
egestyon, &c. [{Aftir{] that it owyth to be knowyn, þat þe bodyis 
of men, qwych be receptaclys of mete and drynke, þei be mynucyd 
and resoluyd, bothe þe bodyis receyuyng, as wele as þo alymentis 
þat be receyuyd, in qwyche þei be resoluyd, fyrst be natural hete, 
qwyche dryith þe moystur of bodyis, and nurchyth and labouryth 
and is febyllyd for þe tyme, and aftir confortyd be slep and browgh 
to equalyte. Þe body is also resoluyd be þe hete of þe sonne and 
be wynde, þe qwyche dryith þe moystour of bodyis [\f. 42v\] and be fed 
of moystur as wele of bodyis as of flodys. Qwan þan þe body is 
hot vaporabyl, þat it stemyth of myghtynes, no3t of labour, for 
sqwyche a dysposyd persone grose metys be norchyng, for þat 
qwyche is sent owte of sqwyche a dysposyd body is of grete 
quantyte, and of gret substauns and grose substauns, for gret hete 
and vaporis of þe body, sicut veneria. And qwan þe body is depressyd, 
lene and weyke, or ellis drye, and þe stomake of no scharp 
appetyte, þan be goode to vse sotel metys þat be lyght of dygestyon, 
as be hennys and partrychis, and þo þat gendyr moystur, as veele 
and kyddys, for þat qwyche is dyssoluyd fro sqwyche a body so 
dysposyd is but of lytil quantyte, for þe streyt passagis of þe 
wombe and of pooris. And þis is þe certeyn wey of doctrine to 
kepe helth, þat a man euir vse metys acordyng to hys complexcion 
|P_147 
in hys helth. As thus, þei þat be of hoote natur and myghty soffycyently, 
hote metys in temperauns acord to hem. And þei þat be [\f. 43\] 
of cold natur, þo thyngis þat be cold in temperauns acorde to þe 
norchyng of þat dysposicion. And on þe lyke wyse of moyste or 
drye bodyis, to vse metys aftir þer dysposicion. But þanne if þe 
hete of þe body be aumentyd and inflamyd, or fyrid be grete inflammacion, 
owdyr for hote metys, or a casuel or a straunge hete, 
þe qwyche ouircomyth and hath lordechyp ouir þe body, þan [{is{] 
it necessary to vse metys contrary, as colde metys, pork, and 
sqwyche odyr. And qwan it is so þat þe stomak is myghti and 
goode, to sqwyche one acordyth best myghty and stronge metys. 
For sqwyche a stomak is lyke to a myghty fyr, þat hath power to 
brenne myghty and grete treys, and þow þei be many. And qwan 
þe stomak is febyl and colde, to sqwyche one sotel metys and 
lyght of dygestyon be most acordyng. For þe werkyng of sqwyche 
a stomak is lyke a fyr þat on ese may brenne rede spyris and 
ruschys. And þe tokyn of a goode stomake is þis: lyghtnes [\f. 43v\] of 
body, and clernes of wytte, and goode appetyte. The tokynys of 
a febyl stomak and of febyl dygestyon be þise: slugynes of þe 
body and starkenes, slownes in alle dedys, but in specyal in gate, 
and also softnes, bolnyng of þe face, and oftyn gapyng with þe 
mowthe, heuynes of þe eyn, reysing of wynde at þe mowth, qwyche 
is clepy[{d{] bolkyng, and in specyal qwan þer rysith sowr or byttyr 
mater, or fleumatyk, fro þe stomak, with þat wynde, and for þat be 
gendryd wyndis and bolnyngis of þe wombe, and þe appetyte is 
mynucyd and febyllyd. And if þis febylnes and indygest mater be 
habundaunt, þer comyth þer-of streykyng owte of þe armys and 
þe body, and þe bak bowyth, and þe nek, and many odyr thyngis 
besyde þat be contrarius to helth, destroy[{u{]s of þe body, and 
coruptifis of natur. Qwerfor, buxum Emperour, þu owyst to kepe 
þe fro sqwyche dy[{s{]conuenyentys, be goode dyetyng and be þisse 
folowyng medycinys. 
 
[\f. 44\] [}The syxte capitil Capitulum vj}] 
Syth þe body of man is coruptybyl, and corrupcion betydyth of 
opposycion complexcionary, and humourys þat be in þe body, as 
sanguyne, rede coler, flewme, and malencoly, qwyche is blak 
coler, I am avysid in þis present werk to wryt to þe profytabyl 
|P_148 
thyngis, and on alle wyse to þe necessary, as of þe priuyteis of þe 
craft of medycine, with þe qwyche thow schalt be contente, sythin 
it is to þe gretly honest, and most conuenyent, þat alle þe sekenes 
of a kyng or a lord be no3t wust of hys leche. And if thow exemplarly

membrys with þi body euynly to strech [\f. 44v\] and streyn owte euynly 
on lenght, and to kembe þine hed. For þe strecchyng owte of þi 
membris strenghyt alle þi body, and makyth dygest humoris 
ascende and to fylle alle partys, and þe kembyng of þine hede 
bryngyth owte vaporys and fumys of noyus humorys, þe qwyche

in somyr wasche þe with cold watir, for [{it{] constreynith and

And thys profytith gretly, for it withdrawyth flewme fro

excludyth ventosyte of þe stomak and of þe wombe, and yeldyth

And if þe constipatyf potage be etyn first, and aftir þat þe molyficatyf,

so þat a man take many sondry potagis or metys qwyche be lyte

qwyche is substancial of abydyng, þat it make resydens in þe

myghty for to dygest, for as myche as þer be in þe bottum fleschly

Reuoke þi wylle fro drynkyng of kold drynkys in mete tyme,

[}The nynghe capitil her beginnith Capitulum ix}] 
And qwan it is so þat þu hast etyn, walke softly a thousand

and þan torne þe on þi left syde and fulfylle þe resydw of þi slepe 
on þat syde. For þe left syde is cold, and hath nede of [\f. 47v\] hetyng, 
qwerfor þe lengest slepe owyth to be on þe left syde. And þan if

þan þe best medycine is for þe to ley on þi wombe a schet

þe sopir profytith mor þat i[{s{] etyn at euyn, þan þat mele þat [{is{]

in speche, and þe spyrite is vexid bothe be heryng and be speche, 
and many odyr thyngis, þat be labour and be hete, and meuyng

atte þe euyn sopir i[{s{] alle þe contrary, if it be so a man hath no3t

vppon þe [{þe{] coldenes of þe nyght, qwyche dryuyth þe myght

Thow schalt also haue knowlech þat he þat is wunt to ete twyis

þat must be done dyscretly and wysely, þat he chonge nowt

And bewar in specyal þat þu ete neuir tyl þat þu knowe surly þat

that takyth mete withowte necessyte of þe body, he schal fynde

qwan þat he hath goode appetyte, he schale fynde þe hete of þe

And if ony of þise maner of kendis schuld be goode, be þei þat be

to conforte in refreschyng, and it restoryth þe brest, and puttyth

[}The twelthe capitil Capitulum xij}] 
Take with þe help of God of spyca indica thre owncys, and of [\f. 71\] 
arecyn, and as myche of amome, and of cubellis thre drammys, and 
lete hem be putt in v vncys of fresch watyr. And aftyr þat lete it 
stonde tylle þe vertu and myght be encresyd, and þan clense it, 
and putte þer-to of hony preparat and claryfiyd an owunce, and 
lette it boyle with a soft fyr tyl it be thyk. And þis is þe seuynth 
medycyne, of home þe propyrte is to repare þe stomak and to dyssolue 
and putte awey ventosyteis. 
 
[}Þe thirten [{capitil{] Capitulum xiij}] 
Take of grene rubarbe þat is sad thre owncis, and of declanucis 
a dram, and brose hem to-gydir, and putte þer-to ten owncis of 
fresch watyr, and lete hem stonde tylle þe vertu be gone in to þe

amende þe lyuir and to repayr þe hert, and to confort þe body. 
[}[{Þe fourtene capitil{] Capitulum xiiij}] 
Than take and gadyr alle thyse medycinys to-gydir, and þus 
schal be made [\f. 71v\] [{þe{] nynthe and þe last medycine. And þan take 
and putte þe quantyte of an egge of datys with-owte stonys, and 
lete it be dyssoluyd as it is wrytin be-forn, but þat date melyte is 
best, qwyche is qwyte and softe with-in as þe brayne is. And qwan 
|P_171 
þei be brokyn in watyr tyl þe strenght be owte þer-of þan gadyr 
alle to-gydir, and putte in vj powund of rose watyre, and þan 
lete it sethe tyl it be thyk. And þan take it off and lete it kele, and 
þan putte þat to þe vnguent klepyd belesan. And put þer-to of 
ambre oryental, or ellis beletan, or orengis, of þise thre drammys 
(+Q iij), and putte þer-to of margarytis brokyn to powdyr half 
a pounde, and of poudyr of precious stonys, þat is to sey rubyis, 
safyris, topasys, jacynctis, +Q i, or to vncis of yche of hem, and of 
þe jwse of narde thre drammys (+Q iij), and of powdyr of gold viij 
drammys. And þan put alle þe forseyd medycinys to þis thyngis, 
and putte þem in a vessel [\f. 72\] of gold þat is smokyd with þe tre of 
aloes, and sette it viij dayis vndyr a rofe qwer pur eyer is, þat 
spyritual vertuys may entir in to it, and lete it stonde þer none 
nyght qwan þe mone is in froward dysposicion and faylith þe 
ouir cowrs, or ellis hys bemys. And qwan it is complete vndyr þis 
seyd forme, it schal be to þe as one of þe grete tresouris of þis 
world. Take þan þerof be-forn mete and aftyr mete one dramme. 
For þis is þe summe of alle medycinys, and chef ende of alle 
mydicynal entencion to fle flewme, coler, malencolye, peyne in þe 
renys, to putte away emerrowdys and alle bolnyng, to dygest þe 
mete and to tempir þe complexcion, to clere þe syte, to sese werkyng 
of þe templys, and, brefly to conclude, it helpyth alle maner 
of sekenes bothe inforth and with-owte. But it hath one specyal 
thynge, þat it causith a man to haue a cler wytte and a goode brayne. 
Qwerfor, o Alysaundyr, if þu vse this thow schalt vse none odyr, 
for þis suffysith. [\f. 72v\] Nor þu schalt neuir blede nor be boystid but be 
þe consel of a man þat is experte in astronomye, and for þis 
cause þe profytabylnes of medycinal kunnyng is exaltyd in þat, 
and þe natural wylle is enclyned and claryfiyd in þat. 
 
[}The fyftene capitil Capitulum xv}] 
Bewar Alysaundyr, þat þu opyn no veyn be þe maner of 
bledyng, nor take no medycine, but be þe lycens of an astronomer. 
And thow schuldyst algatis attempt be þine owne rede, do it no3t 
tylle þe tyme þat þe nwe moone be growyn so myche þat it be 
pasyd fro þe sonne. And be war þat þe mone be no3t in Cancro nor 
in Pyscibus. And be war of þe beholdyng or respecte of þe sonne 
|P_172 
ascendyng to þe mone, and also qwan þe moone is in coniu[{n{]xcion 
with þe sonne in a quwattry sygne, as Pysces or Capricorne or 
sqwyche anodyr. Be war les þat Mercury be in constellacion 
ascendyng, and also of Saturne. And þe most profytabyl of owrys 
in opynnyng of veynis is in þe myddys of þe mo[{n{]th lunar, [\f. 73\] þat 
is, qwan þe mon[{e{] begynith to wane, and þat it be in Libra or 
in Scorpyone, and qwan noying sterris be-holde it no3t, þat is to 
se be no3t dyrecte þer ayens, for þan þe mone is werst and noyabyl 
in werkyng. And as for boyistyng, only it may conuenyently be 
done in þe waxeng of þe mone, qwan þat noyabyl sterris behold it 
no3t, schewyng her bemys directely þer-vppon. But qwan it is 
euyn ayens Mercury, and þat þe mone and þe planete of Venus be 
in one sygne, or ellis þat Venus and Mercuryus behold þe mone, 
and qwan it is so þat þe moone is in constellacion ascendyng, þan 
hath it power and rewle ouir þat same place in þe Scorpyon. 
Qwerfor, qwan þu wulte take a laxatyfe, loke þat þe mone be in 
Scorpyon or in Lybra or in Pyscibus, but bewar of neghyng nere 
of þe mone to þe planete of Saturne, for þan it makyth humorys 
and also þe medycine to congele in þe body. And [\f. 73v\] þe mor þat þe 
[{mo{]ne elongid is fro Saturne, so myche þe bettyr, and þow it be 
with [{þe{] planete of Mercury it is no3t to be feryd. Lete þan þe 
begynnyng and chef of his body be aftyr þe goode constellacion of 
þe mone, and þe absens fro noyus sterris, and his prosperyte in 
hys ascens or goying vppe. And qwan þu wulte yef a medycine, loke 
in qwat sygne be þe mone and þe sonne, þe qwyche þu mayst know 
be [{þe{] monthe qwyche þu art inne, and if þu beholde dyligen[{t{]ly 
þe sygnys and þe monthys descryuyd in þis present spere. And 
if þe mone be in þe sygne þat is coleryk, þu must make þat medicyne 
the more scharp. And if it be in a malycoly sygne þu must make it 
ryght stronge, and if it be in a flewmatyk sygne, but esy and soft, 
aftyr þe qwalyte of þe sygne and aftyr resun, for qwan þe sonne 
is in þe decens, þe natur of þe wombe is made sad and also losyd. 
Qwerfor dyligently it owyth to be consydryd [\f. 74\] qwydir þe moone 
be in a coleryk signe or in a malencoly sygne or in a flewmatyk 
sygne. And if it be so þat bothe lumynaryis, þat is to sey þe sunne 
and þe mone, be in colerryk sygnys, or ellis þat þei neghe or 
|P_173 
beholde sqwyche maner sygnys, dowght no3t þat a medycyne þan 
schal lytyl profyte as to losyng of þe wombe but if it hurt gretly 
natur. And if it be takyn in a melancolyk sygne, owdyr it schal 
profyte ryght nowght vttyrly, or vttyrly to myche it schal lose þe 
receyuur. And if þe sunne and þe mone be in a flewmatyk sygne, 
þe laxatyfe þat is youyn warkyth esyly, and namely if þe mone 
be in waxyng, for as Doctour Plynyus seyth þat, þe moone waxyng, 
alle humorys þat be in a man encrese, and also, decresyng þe mone, 
humoris mynwse or decrese, experyens schewyth. 
Here endyth þe thyrd boke of secretis.
