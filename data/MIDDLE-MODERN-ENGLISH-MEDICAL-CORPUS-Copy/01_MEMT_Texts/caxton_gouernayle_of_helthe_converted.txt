[^CAXTON, GOUERNAYLE OF HELTHE^]

[^ff. A1-^] 
|P 
In this tretyse that is cleped Gouernayle 
of Helthe, what is to 
be sayd wyth crystis helpe of some 
thynges that longen to bodily 
helthe, had and to be kept; or 
to bodily helthe, lost and to be recouered: and 
is departed in viij chapytures, that is to saye - 
In the fyrste chapytre, of the profytte of goode 
Gouernayle of helth. In the ij chapitre, what 
is first on morow to be don. In the iij chapitre, 
of bodyly excersyce, that is to saye, besynes & 
his profyte. In the fourth chapytre, of spyces 
of excersice. In the fyfthe chapytre, how a man 
sholde haue hym in mete, in etyng his metes. 
In the vj chapitre, how a man shold haue hym 
in drynkyng of his drynkes. In the vij chapytre 
what sholde be don after mete. In the viij 
chapytre of the noyse of euyll gouernaunce. 
 
IT nedyth hym that woll haue longe 
lyff to knowe the crafte of holsome gouerneyle. 
And so for to kepe contynuelly the 
helthe of his body, for els he maye not com to 
|P 
his naturell ende, but he shall dye or his kyndeli 
tyme come. And therfore thus sayeth Galyen 
the connynge: He sayth holsom gouernaunce 
is meruelous, for it maketh a man to 
lyue tylle he be olde, and wythout sikenes in 
to the laste of his elde and age. Therfor the 
same Galyen, after that he knewe the crafte 
of holsom gouernaunce, came neuer into no 
sikenes, but seelde that was in to a fymeram, 
that is to saye a sharpe feuer; and that was 
for trauayll in vysityng of his frendys aboute 
the comyn profyte. For thus he sayth, I take 
God to recorde, and his angels assygned to kepe 
me, that who that wylfully and besily wyl 
studye in the treatyse of holsom gouernau~ce, & 
woll kepe alhole the doctryne therof, he shall neuer 
dye but on and vpon kyndly deth, whiche 
deth is swete and softe, wythout grete payn, 
as the same Galyen witnesseth in the dyfference 
of feuerys. But vnderstonde that holsome 
gouernaunce may no man duely kepe that 
most nedyes be occupyed, wyl hym or nyl hym, 
and may not when hym nedeth leue of; for thy 
|P 
it nedeth hym that he haue that nedeth hym to 
his lyf wythoute trauayle and pencyfull, and 
in alle thyngys that he be of fre condycyon. 
Ferthermore it is to wete that viij thynges 
at the leste be nedefull in holsome gouernayle; 
of whiche the fyrst is a dyscrete choys of 
thoo thynges that shall be eten or dronken. 
The seconde is wylfull bodyli exersice tofore 
mete, and that tyl the swetyng begynne, or 
namely tyll his wynde chaunge fro sloughe to 
swyftness. The thirde is well profytable and 
wel nedeful that all that shall be etyn be wele 
and smale chewed. The fourth is that thou ete 
while thou hast talent to ete. The v is that 
thou slepe on morow tyl thou wake be thyne 
owne wyll. For as Arystotle sayth, not only 
in metys and drynkys be we noryshed and 
fostred, but also in slepe. The vj is that thou 
take no mete and drynk in sorow ne in care 
but in Joye as moche as thou may. The vij 
is that thou haue ne holde no colde in wynter 
ne in somer after bloodletynge. This viij is 
that thou use saffron in thy mete, for it quycneth 
|P 
kyndely hete, & comforteth thy dygestyon, 
& taryeth thyne elde or age, & bryngeth 
in gladnes, and letteth thyne humors fro rotynge 
and driynge. 
 
IT is in storyes of our elders, that on a 
tyme a myghty kyng brought to gyder 
thre of the best leches that myght be of 
Jnde of Mede & of Grece. And he commaunded 
hem that eche of theym sholde studye to 
assygne the best medycyne, whiche yf a man 
wolde vse, sholde profyte hym to helpe of bodye, 
and hym sholde nede none other medycyn. 
Truly the leche of Grece assygned and sayd; 
that euery daye a man to take twys his mouthe 
full of hote Water, sholde make a man soo 
hole that hym sholde nede none other medycyn. 
And the leche of Mede assigned and sayd; that 
it sholde profyte moch euery daye fastynge to 
take gromel seyd. And I saye, sayd Arystotle, 
y=t= he that slepeth so moche that he haue noo 
heuynes in his wombe of mete that he tok tofore, 
hym dare not drede of any grete sikenes, 
ne of the goute. Also who that eteth euery daye 
|P 
erly vij dragmes, that is to saye xxj peny 
weyght, of swete reisyns, he dare not drede of 
flewmy sikeness; and his mynde shall be amended, 
and his vnderstondyng shall be clere; and 
who that vseth it in tyme accordynge to his 
complexion may be sure and drede not of the 
Feuer quarteyn. Also who that eteth nottes 
and fygges with a fewe leues of Rewe, that 
daye shall no venym hym noye. It was axed 
of Galien what medicyn were mooste 
profytable, and he ansuerd abstynence. And 
Constantyne seyth in his book that hight vyatyk, 
that whoso woll kepe his contynuell helthe, 
kepe his stomak, soo that when hym nedethe 
mete, leue it not ne take no more thereof 
than hym nedeth; and the same vnderstond of 
drynke. Also in holsom gouernance fle wrath, 
grete thought, heuynes, angre, and suche other, 
for all ghostly accydentes, that ys to saye sodeyn 
fallyng in to a mannys mynde, outaken 
Joye alonly, dryen, and that moysteth; netheles 
some hetyn as wrath, for thy wrath profyteth 
to flewmatyk men, and it harmeth coleryk 
|P 
men. Morouer it is to wete than in lente 
season, that is to say in veer, & in the begynnyng 
of somer, children ben wele atte ease after 
the liknes of tempred qualitees: but other 
ages ben wele at ease in contraryous tymes, 
as olde men in somer, and yonge men in wynter. 
Also in holsom gouernau~ce kepe thys reule: 
yf thou wolt be hoole & sou~de, flee heuy charges, 
be not wroth, soupe not to late, and flee vndermele 
slepe; wake after mete, and eschew & spare 
stronge drynkes, and namely of wyne; hold 
not thy pysse, ne constrayn the not to siege; kepe 
well these three thynges - gladnes in mynde, 
traueyll in mesure, and reule of mete & drynke; 
as moche as thou wold, ete boldly in wynter, 
& in veer skarsly; and in somer mesure wel 
thy metes, and flee, nameli, frutes of auguste. 
Arystotle wrytyng to gret Alexandre sayd; syth 
man is a brityl body, me semeth I sholde wryte 
to the some profytable thynge of lechecrafte. Yf 
thou wolte, he sayd, besily behold then sample of 
holsom gouernaunce, and lyue after thys precyous 
ordre of dyet, ye shall nede no leche, oute 
|P 
take accydentes of batayll and suche other. 
 
[}What is fyrst on morow to be done.}] 
AFter that a man hath wele and peasible 
fulfylled his slepe, loke he ryse & cloth 
hym self wyth goode clothe & swete, yf he have 
them; then he oweth to walk a lytil, euenli 
to stretche oute his lymmes, & kembe his hed; 
for whi kembyng draweth out the vapours y=t= 
comyn from the stomake to the hed in tyme of 
slepe. And therwyth loke that ye be besie to put 
oute the superfluytees of the body in siegyng, 
pyssyng, koughyng, and spyttyng; then loke he 
wesshe his handes & his face in somer wyth 
colde water, and in wynter wyth hoote water; 
then loke he praye and preyse his lorde after 
the doctryne of his lawe, and vysite the pore 
in god; then, yf it lyke hym, he sholde studye or 
rede, dyspute or talke, and wyse me~nys counceyl 
and seye~g besily here, and in mesure be mery, & 
flee vtterly wrath and sorow, in as moche as 
he maye, and vse hym selfe mesurable trauayl, 
as walkyng or ridyng, and in clene hihe places, 
fro myer and marrys; for this profyteth 
|P 
moche, for it breketh wynde in a manys body, 
and strenghyth & lyghteth his lymmes, and 
comforteth the heete of the stomak, and strengyth 
his ioyntes, and melteth euil humors. 
 
[}Of the body exersice & of his profite.}] 
WE owen to knowe by auctors of leche 
crafte, that thoo that shall lyue fayr & 
wel in holsom gouernaunce, owen to haue euyn 
and tempered exersice to fore mete; for that 
yeueth to all the body tempered hete, euyn and 
not passyng. Whiche sholde a manys exersice 
be, a fycysion discreuyth thus: Exersice is a 
wylfull meuyng, by whiche a manys wynde 
is made grete, and ofte it nedeth that thys 
traueyll be wylful, and not stressyd by nede, 
but that he be all fre and worche after his oune 
wyll. And therfore labour of carpenters & 
plowmen, masons, maryners, and suche other, 
is none exercyse of lechecrafte, for it hath not 
properly wylfull meuyng. Marchauntes treuly, 
burgeys, cloysterers, & suche other walkynge 
wele and longe, but it ys not properly exercyse 
of lechecraft but whan a man walketh freli 
|P 
of his oune wyll, and so swyftly tyl he begyn 
to feynt and his wynde chaunge, then anone 
he shold sitte and reste, for yf he meuyd eny furder 
hit sholde be payn and feyntnes; and suche 
exercyse is cleped tempred, for therby grouen 
many goodes to ma~nys body. Fyrst, for therby 
is the kyndely hete strenghyd & eched, and 
so ben other iiij vertues, that is to saye, vertu 
drawynge, vertue defiynge, vertue wythholdyng, 
and vertue oute-puttyng. And so ben 
there v bodily wyttes, that is to saye, herynge, 
seeng, smellyng, tastyng, and felynge. And so 
ben there iij myndely vertues, that is to saye, 
imagynatyf, dyscretyfe, and memoratyfe. 
And though errour happed in all these worchynges 
of lechecrafte, so it were not to notable, 
and exercyse were as sholde be, sholde neuer 
or seelde ma~nys body nede other medicyne, for 
exercyse fulfylleth the defautes of all other. 
For thy be they mery that dreden bloodletyng 
and other doutefull medycyns, but by exercyse 
they mowen be heled & sauyd. Netheles ij 
thynges bey nedefull to euery well exercysed, 
|P 
that is to saye, that he be not to full ne to emty; 
to full, then wolde the humours lose, and 
so were gret drede of the lyuer or some feuer or 
sodeyne deth; for thy in suche a caas loke ther 
be longe dyscrete abstynence, so that he be not 
to empty, for then sholde his body be feble oute 
of mesure, and at the last for febelnes it most 
nedys lose. Therfor who that is to empty, it 
nedeth that he labour not tyll he be more and 
better releued. Truly aucturs sayen that exercyse 
is one of the hihest and nobelest thyng 
that maye be done of to ma~nys body, and full 
nedefull it is in gouernayll of helth, and lengthyng 
of lyfe, forwhy exercyse fulfylleth the 
medycynes of bloodes and bathynges and suche 
other thynges, and therein is no drede nor 
bytternes ne exspences, but therin is pure recreacyon 
of body & of soule, soo it be don in clene 
places. And then sholde men shew hem selfe 
to the clene eyer, and delyte in seeng ferre & nere, 
water and lande, heuen and erthe, grene and 
falow; and in all thyse he sholde prayse and 
worship our Lord God. Fulgens dyscryueth 
|P 
exercyse in a full fayr maner, thus seyeng: Exercyse 
is true kepyng of ma~nys lyf, and pricke 
of kynde slepynge, and the fylthe of foule 
colour, and teendyng of slothes hete, and wastyng 
of superfluytes, and saddynge of lymmes, 
and sleeng of siknesses, and dryuynge a-waye 
of vyces, medycyne of langores, wynnyng 
of tyme, and dette of youthe, and joye 
of elde or age, and helpe of helth, enmye of idelnes, 
and dystroyeng of all euyll. But emong 
all other thynges it is to wete that exercyse, 
mesured meserably, heteth a ma~nys bloode and 
dryeth it; and therfore mesurable fleumatyk 
men shold vse it. And reste coleth a man and 
moysteth hym, and that is goode for coleryk 
men. For thy he alone draweth hym selfe from 
exercyse that wolde fayn fayle joye and felicyte 
in thys lyf. Galyen sayth that grete purgacyons 
and vomytes sholde not be take~ but 
selden and for grete nede; for why, whoo soo 
woll eche moneth ones or twyes gretly purge 
hym self, he shall brynge his body to many 
euyll vses; for he shall engendre therin many 
|P 
noyous humors. For why eche daye exercyse 
is ful nedefull to kepe a manys helth; for who 
that eteth or drynketh moche maye not be hole 
but yf he woll somwhat slepe and swynke. 
Thenne theise thynges that be sayd it sheweth 
that mesured exercyse hath many profytes, 
for it styreth the kyndly hete and openeth 
the poores, and losith colde and thyck towgh 
humours, and whenne they ben losed bereth 
hem oute at the poores, and maketh a ma~nys 
ioyntes slypper & lyghte, and it comforteth all 
the membres of a ma~nys body. Wherfor noious 
humors ben more holsomly purged and 
mesured by exercyse then by laxatyues or vomytees, 
for nother of them maye be wythout 
empeyreme~t of kynde. And ryght as due kepynge 
of kyndely exercyse is nedeful, soo other while 
ys reste. For why rest in as moche as 
it is contrary to exercyse, some ys bodily some 
is ghostly, of whiche eche either yf it be mesured 
after that kynde wolde, it is heleful bothe 
to the body & soule, and yf it be not soo it is co~trary. 
For whi yf rest be to moche it gendreth 
|P 
norysheth and multyplyeth euyll humors and 
encreaseth moche corupcyon. For why when 
water resteth to moche it stynketh, soo iron & 
eche metall rustyth when it restyth. 
 
[}The Spyces of Exercyse.}] 
SPyces of exercyse ben ther wel many, 
as ther be dyuerse statys of persones; 
some be strong and some be feble, som 
ryche & some pore, som prelates and at the large, 
and some subjettes & enclosed. And somtime 
weder is fayr & clere, and somtyme not so 
but derke & reyne: and therfor it nedeth to haue 
spyces of exercyse. Forwhi the beste spyce & 
the fyrste ys to walke tofore mete in hihe places 
& clene. Another spyce is to ryde and y=t= 
is for ryche men, but grete prelates moste haue 
other maners of exercyse. For whi in chambre 
shall be a grete corde knytted in the ende & 
hanged up, and take that corde wyth both ha~des 
and stonde vpryght soo that thou touche 
not the erthe, and stonde a good while, the~ne 
runne as moche as thou mayst heder and theder 
wyth that corde, and otherwhile skyppe. And 
|P 
yf this please the not, haue a stone of xxx li. 
weyghte or theraboute, and yf thou wolt haue 
helthe therin ofte bere that ston fro that on 
side of that house to that other side, or a longe 
whyle holde vp that ston or thou let it doun, or 
bere it a boute thy necke or bytwene thy handes, 
and so of other maners tyl thou feynt; or 
thus hold a staffe in thy hand, and lete another 
take hit from the yf he maye wyth euyn 
draughte; or thus close a peny in thyn hand & 
lete another take it yf he may; or thus holde 
thy breth as longe as thou maist, and thenne 
puffe it oute as harde as thou maist do. And 
this maner of exercyse is full profytable to 
put oute noyos superfluytees; for why many 
superfluytees in slepe ben wythholden, therfore 
yf thou haue non other maner of exercyse holdyng 
of breth helpeth it moche. Yet 
ther ben other maners of exercyse for yonge 
men that ben lusty, as to renne to wrastle, to 
lepe, to caste the stone; and so of other playes. 
Also tempred fleshly companyng with a yo~g 
broun woman is goode in wynter, and wyth 
|P 
a yonge white woman ys goode in somer; is 
also goode & helpyng in gouernyng of helthe 
to body but not to soule, except to them 
that mowen haue it by Goddes lawes; so netheles 
that ther be so moche tym bytwene, that 
he fele hymselfe eased and lyghtened in his body, 
and that he ete the better & slepe the better. But 
therwyth vnderstonde that as moche as helpyth 
tempred companyenge, so moche noyeth 
dystempred co~panye~g, and namely to moche, 
for it coleth him, wasteth him, & febleth him. 
Forwhy ma~nys kinde is made of the beste 
bloode & beste defyed, that hastely maye torne 
into manys lymmes: and forwhi whenne 
a ma~ casteth oute that noble humors to moche, 
he is hugely dyscolored and his body moche 
febled, more then he lete foure sithes so moche 
bloode oute of his body; also who that moche 
deleth or co~panyeth fleshly wyth a woman, 
lyghtly kacheth y=e= palsey with more euyll. 
 
[}How a man sholde haue hym in etyng.}] 
WHen a man hath well exercysed him 
as it is seyd tofore, rest a while after, 
|P 
and then a lityl freshe whete brede wele baked 
and somdel soured; then drynk a draught of 
goode clere wyne or other goode sauery drynke; 
then rest a while after, and studie in som 
wyse meanes; then haue som solace & myrthes 
wyth thy frende and wyth other honest co~pany; 
then ayenst euyn take thy mete & supper 
moost sauorly, but yf thy costome be there ageyn. 
But a generalle rule of all fysik & leches 
is that thyne houre of etyng be when thou art 
kyndly hungry: and tofore thyn hunger ete 
not, but yf it be a lityll messe of goode & clene 
warme mete to prouoke thyn appetyte wyth; 
& when thou hast appetyte let not, for as a fycysion 
seyth, the stomak oute of vse to suffre 
hunger fulfylleth the body of roten humors. 
And then woll a ma~nys body wexe full of 
noughty humors, by cause that the colere ys 
drawen to the mouth of the stomak, so that 
afterwarde when he wold ete he may not. Ferthermore 
it ys to wyte that no man sholde ete 
but he knew certaynly his stomak voyde of 
that thyng that he ete tofore, and that shall a 
|P 
man knowe by desire that he hath to ete, and 
by ple~te of spyttyng comyng vp to his mouthe. 
Forwhi who that eteth wythoute desire, 
his mete shall fynd the kyndly hete of his stomak 
colde; and he that etyth wyth desire he shal 
fynde the kyndely hete of stomake gyue vp a 
smell & sauoure like encense. But thise & suche 
other shold be vndersto~de of hem that haue 
mete ordeyned at her own wyll, and who y=t= that 
not, ete when he maye haue it, for they ben not 
bounden to the lawes of this crafteli dyatore. 
As to the qualitees of thi metes, vndersto~de 
that thilke mete whiche that moste gouerneth 
thyn helthe sholde not be passyng in any qualite: 
forwhi the metes that ben to hote bre~nen 
the blood, as peper, garlek, oynyo~s, cresses, sauge, 
myntes, persile, & suche other; and tho metes 
that ben to cold fresyn the blood, as letuse, pursila~, 
gourdes, & suche other. And yf thi metes 
ben to watry then they rote thi blood, as be~ 
melons & co~combres; and yf thy metes ben to 
drye it throwith oute thyn vytayll vertues; & 
yf thy metes be~ to fatte they let thi dygestio~ 
|P 
and yf thi metes ben to swete, they stoppe~ the 
and make the constypat & costyff; and thi metes 
ben bitter they vtterly noryshen the not. 
And yf thy metes be to salte they bre~nen, noye~, 
& breken thy stomak; and if thy metes ben to 
soure they maken the sone olde. Forthy non 
of thise metes moche & contynuelly vsed is 
good to helthe of mannys body, but only that 
mete is goode that is tempored and wantyth 
to mykilnesse, as ben thyse good metes for helthe 
of ma~nys body & holsom, lambe of on yere, 
yonge kyddes, souking calues, he~nys, capons, 
chekyns, pertryches, ploueres, fesau~tes, smale 
byrdes of the feeld & of the woode, but not of 
the water; and, when the season comyth, yo~ge 
rabettes and pygges feet ben goode, & other 
extremytees, as groye~ & eres, and scaled fyshe 
of clene rennyng water, rere eyren or eggis, 
also borage, langdebuff, whete bred well bake 
& well leuyned and somdele saltyd, of that 
that is one daye olde or tweyn, and of other 
that ben not to moche passeng in eny qualyte. 
And yf we drede~ excesse of any qualite amend 
|P 
it by the contrary thereof; an ensample, yf thou 
be seke of euyll & toughe metes vse therfore 
sharpe metes & shorte, as a lityll of harde chese, 
skraped metes & shorte; as a lityll quantyte, & also 
a pere or two or thre of the most best frute 
to thy complexion & nature. Sothly salte metes, 
soure & bytter, may be ame~ded wyth swete 
appuls, swete metes be~ amended wyth swete 
hony & good olde wyne, and so of all other; & 
yf thou wolte ete frute, ete hem fast, as cherise 
grapes & almondes, and after mete a few peres 
quynces & nottes, a few while they be grene; 
and walnottes ben best, but let the skyn be 
clene pyked away fro the mete. Also the complexion 
of a man shold be loked to as yf he be 
tempred, kepe hym soo wyth lyke metis and 
drynkys; and yf it be dystempered, by his contrare 
bryng it lityll & lytyl aye~ to tempre; & for 
whi to sangweyn men dystempered gyue malincoliouse 
metes, and to malencolyouse men 
sangueyen metes, and to flewmatyk men coleryk 
metes, for euery euyl complexion may 
be broughte to temprure, but if necessaryes of 
|P 
lyuelode let it. And know when thou wolte, 
and note it for a souerayye notabylite, who y=t= 
etyth ofte mylke & fyshe, ofte katchen therof a 
lepre or a white skabbe. Also ofte to vse wyne, 
as grete & hihe myghty or hihe coloured, and 
mylke to gyder, bryngeth a man to both lepre 
& skab. Here none suffysyth of qualyte of metes. 
As to the quantyte vnderstonde that thy 
mete ne thy drynke sholde be no more but as 
thi kyndely helthe myght ouercom it, elles thy 
body shall waste and thy vertues wexe feble. 
And for the qua~tyte of metes, drynkes, maye 
not certenly be shewed, loke how thou feylst it 
hath don the most good, and suche quantyte 
vse. Furdermore vnderstonde that no man 
sholde ete anone after his exercyse, ne anon after 
he were bathed, but fyrste rest hym a while 
so that he hungre, and then when he woll ete, 
yf he be a ryche ma~ sette tofore hym many metes, 
of which that one is better tha~ that other; 
for a fycysion seyth it shall better saue hym 
& better noryshe hym, and skyll whi; for mete 
that is taken with delyte the stomak hugely 
|P 
coueteth, hastely kacheth, lo~g holdeth, and wel 
defyeth; and that mete that is beste defyed is 
moste noryshing for ma~nys body. Truly other 
mete that is not defyed is taken wyth 
fulsomnes, and defyeth not well; for whi yf a 
man desyre more motion then a capon, the moton 
shall rather be eten, and so of all other metes. 
But there that is moche distau~ce in qualyte 
of metys, we mowen not doo thus. And 
also bewar that it be none errau~t appetyte, as 
in wymmen that ben wyth childe, and though 
it otherwhile be, yet shall it not alwaye be denyed. 
Furthermore as Galyen sayeth, that at 
one mele men sholden not ete dyuerse metes, & 
therefore at morow ete but bred alone, and at euyn 
flesh alone; for when two dyuerse metes 
ben take at one mele, of hem comyn two euyles, 
one in eyther by it sylfe, another in hem bothe 
togyder in hemselfe; for then one traueyleth 
to torne into grete & heuy humours, and that 
other into subtyl & lyghte in hem both. For 
if the subtyl mete goo before it is fyrst defyed, & 
goyth fourth & draweth wyth hym the grete 
|P 
mete vndefyed; and yf the grete mete goo fyrste 
tofore, then the subtyll mete ys not defyed, 
and maye not for the grete goo forth; and so 
it wexyth corupte. And which of thise maners 
euer it be, alwaye it is euyll, but more 
euyll it is that the subtyll folowe the gret, for 
the chaufyng & chau~gyng into kynde of raunes 
may be holpen, but the chau~gyng into corupcyon 
neuer or selden, and of wonder harde 
is holpen. And therto accordeth Galyen, 
a ficysion, & other olde doctours: but netheles 
perauenture a contraryous costume longe vsed 
may doo awaye the corrupcon. Also wete 
well that vertue of defyynge is ofte brokyn 
when rawe mete is putte on halfe soden, for 
the toon rawness showueth out the other, and 
so the half sodyn is corupte. Moreouer that 
no man ete so moche that the stomak be heuyed 
therwyth, ne that his appetyte cease. But 
who that vsith grete exercyse & to moche and 
selde, and therewyth eteth vnruly, & contynueth 
it, he shall dye by sodeyn deth, or shall fele wycked 
sikeness, ye though his mete were ryghte 
|P 
goode, for by cause his dygestion is corrupte. 
Therefore kepe well thi stomak from to moche 
mete and drynke; and it so myshap any tyme, 
anoon wyth water & oyle or such other, spue 
it out anon, and then slepe, and yf thou maye 
not slepe, walk softely vp and downe, and xxiiij 
houres ete not after, ne drynke not; then ete a 
lytill with a draught of good cleyne wyne, so 
the wyne be not to gret ne of hihe colour. And 
on the thyrday haue some exercyse and be bathed; 
then ete a lytyll after, and after slepe & 
thou may then vse this electuare dyatryon, 
as sayth a fycysion. Two causes ben of sikenesses, 
that is, dyuers metes, and long syttynge, 
and moche etyng of dyuers metes; for of hem 
ben gendred dyuers humours, some goode and 
some euyll: long syttyng, for then the mete that 
fyrste taken is defyed er the last begynne to 
defye; and so y=t= is defyed draweth wyth hym 
to the lyuer that is vndefyed, and to thise two 
ben cause of grete sikenesses. Also as old wyse 
men sayen, man sholde neuer ete his fylle 
at one mele in takyng dyuerse metes, for as 
|P 
Auycenne sayth, no thynge is worse than to 
multyple metes and so to sytte long therat. 
For thi he sayth that men in olde tyme were satysfyed 
at morow wyth bred alone, and at euyn 
wyth fleshe alone. And therwyth they 
sayden resonably the more mete sholde be towarde 
euyn, but the costume were contrary; for Auycene 
seyth that hoole men sholde better ete at 
ayenste nyght then on morow, for the kyndeli 
hete is closed wythin them and gadreth about 
the bowelles. Netheles flewmatyk men ete not 
to colde, for they neden but lytyll exercyse to meue 
her kindeli hete, whiche mowe ete by the morowe. 
But now the mooste 
vsage is here ageyn, and among many me~ 
it is fou~de more holsome to ete by daye then by 
nyght, and perauenture that is skyll of costume. 
And therfor thus sayth a wyseman; short 
souper and light soper is selden greuous, gret sopers 
noye~ as leches teche; we rede it ofte ope~li. 
Also as Auycene seyth; bytwene two etynges 
xi houres to be is profytable, and so ete thries 
in two days, as to daye twyes and to morow 
|P 
but ones, and so to contynue forth; so that yf 
errour sall in twyes etyng, and so age~yward; 
for that one most be amended by that other, 
sith it is harde to live without errour. Moreouer 
vnderstonde that men that have goode 
vnderstondyngs etyn for they wolde lyue, but 
they that goon by fleshlynes wolden lyue for 
to ete, and contrary to nature. And wyte thou 
well that to a coleryk ma~nys stomak when y=e= 
vertue is stronge and gret hete, grete metes 
ben good, as beoff, porke, gret venyson, & grete 
bestly fyshes, roughe & gret bred, salte mete, 
fleshe half sodyn, & grete myghty coloured wyne; 
and yf the hete of the stomak be feble, and if 
he haue but littyl exercyse, the metes aforsayd 
wolde much noye hym; but to suche a stomak 
gyue subtyl metes, as chekyns, & smale fyshes 
of stony rennyng water, rere egges, bred welle 
baken and well soured, smalle wyne, and of 
clene & orye~t coloure, not depe, & suche other. 
But thise metes sholden be corrupte of a~ hote 
stomak. And yf the vertue dygestyff be in y=e= 
meane tyme of dyetyng, as capones, hennes, 
|P 
pertryches, and suche other. Also in gouernau~ce 
of helthe, fle all excessyuous metes, and namely 
these, but if it be for a medycyne; fle also 
all frutes, and also herbes that ben not goode, 
as thise, namely, colewortes & letuys, for they 
make~ malyncolyouse blood. Galye~ sayth y=t= my 
fader euer forbad me y=t= I should ete no new frutes 
& grene, yf I wolde be wythoute sekenes, 
for he hymselfe did and was euer wythouten 
sikenesses; and while he lyued, so did I, & was 
also wythouten sikenes; and when he was 
ded, I eete frutes, & caught the feueres; and after 
that I caughte connyng to kepe my silfe, I 
kepte me from frutes, & I had no nomore the feueres, 
but if it were a lytyll sharpe feure called 
offymera. And all my frendes that kepten 
my doctryne, kept hem from frutes and hadde~ her 
helth. Arnolde, a grete clerke, sayth thus; In is 
le~te long vsag of stoppyng metes, as fyshe & 
pese potage; therfor it is profytable first to ete 
porren of peses, for this is a water that wyse 
men hath co~mended; and thus it is made; doo 
pesyn in fayr water all nyghte, & in the same 
|P 
water boyle them on morow a goode while, 
and thenne clense them and kepe the clensyng, 
and whan mete tyme comyth, doo therto a lityl 
wyne, a lityll powder of spyknarde, a lityll safron, 
& clene smale white salte, and than boyle 
it on a walme, and so ete, for it openeth & clensith 
well the capytalle veynes of the lyuer, & 
the weyes ofte of the vryne, and kepeth fro y=e= 
stone & grauelles, namly yf the forsaid pesen 
be soden in the forsaid water wyth persily. 
 
[}How a man sholde haue hym in his drynke.}] 
THe lesse ye drynk at mete the better it is, 
euer so it be mesurably taken, for a man 
sholde not at mete drynke moche lest it make 
mete to swymme in his stomak: forthy men 
should drynk a lityll, so that the mete be well 
medeled & tempred togyder, and then lete a lo~ge 
while bytwene or thou drynke ayen, and 
than drynke a grete draught at ones, ne drynke 
not to moche aftyr the firste morsell in no 
maner of wyse, but drynke ofte a lityll & a lityll 
of smalle clene wyne, best accordynge to 
helthe & gouernynge of thy complexion and 
|P 
nature; and for helthe of body is clene and 
smalle claret wyne, not to new ne to myghty, 
so it be well and proporcyonli tempred wyth 
the quantyte of clene water. Moreouer no ma~ 
be so hardy to drynk fastyng cold water, ne after 
that the hath accompanyed wyth a woman, 
ne after gret trauayle, ne after exersice, tyll he 
haue fyrst rested hym, ne by nyght namely yf 
he haue do gloue tofore, forwhi longe slepe & 
fast slepyng is cure therto. 
 
[}What shall be don after mete.}] 
AFter when thou hast ete, thou sholdest sto~de 
or walke a lytyll softly vp & down tyl 
thy mete goo downe to the botom of thy stomak, 
and then slepe a lityll, yf thou be vsed therto 
both daye and nyght, namly slepe fyrst on thy 
ryght side, for that is kyndely, for thy dygestio~ 
shall be better, for then lieth thy lyuer vnder thi 
stomak, as fyre vnder a caudren. And after 
thi fyrst slepe, turne on thy lifte syde that thy 
ryght side maye be rested of thy longe lygyng 
theron, and whan thou hast layen theron a 
good while and slept, turne ayen on thi ryght 
|P 
side, and ther slepe all nyght forth. And loke y=t= 
thou lye not to streight ne to croked, wyth thi 
legges but in a meane bytwene streight & croked. 
And in no wyse lie not vpryght, for the~ 
woll the superfluytees abyde wythin the and 
turne to wycked & greuous euylles contrarye 
to helthe. Also to lye grouelyng on the wombe 
is goode, so that thy breth be not greued therwyth 
& the heuyer; and the gretter thi mete be & 
the more thou hast taken thereof, euer the le~ger 
sholde thi nyght slepe be, and euer y=e= subtiler y=t= 
thi mete be & y=e= lesse thou haue, euer y=e= lesse shold 
thy slepe be. For slepe is full helpy to olde me~, 
for it maketh them moyst, & therfor sayth Galye~, 
when he was olde he ete letuses wyth spyses 
for he wolde slepe the better. Morouer sleepe is 
full helpy to the dygestyo~ of thi metes, but not 
anone after that thou hast eten, for thou myghtist 
be strangled Also wete thou that yf a 
man before auyntisshed of his body, moche slepe 
then is not good for hym, for it woll waste 
his moystnes; and of one thing beware that 
to longe slepe or to shorte febleth a ma~nys body 
and breketh it. And after thou hast eten 
|P 
take no letuaryes ne other hote thynges, for 
they tournen thi mete to corrupco~n; ne anone 
after thou hast ete, re~ne not ne ride not to fast, 
for then euery stronge meuyng thyng turneth 
thi mete to corrupcyon; and also the vertue dygestyf 
is noryshed thurgh rest; also after mete 
& tofore mete, as much as thou mayst, flee 
wrath, sorow, & pencyfulnesse. And right as tofore 
mete, exercyses be good, so after mete they 
noye~, and rest is best. Morouer Aueroys seyth, 
ryght as colde water caste in a potte boylyng, 
letteth the boyling for a tyme, so to drynke after 
mete, namely sone, letteth the dygestyon & 
maketh it to cease for a tyme; and therfore yt 
is not good after mete to drynk moche tyll y=e= 
mete be defyed, but after mete to suffre thurst 
somwhat is good. And yf thou wolt easely 
voyde thi stomak, stonde aftur thi souper tylle 
thou be wery, or walke a thousand paces; and 
wete thou that glotery, and when thy mete defyeth 
not well, what euer the caas be, bathynge, 
ne bloode lettynge, ne exercyse, ben not good, 
but rest, slepe, abstynence, and diatryon pypion. 
|P 
Exercyse is not good, for therby sholde thikke 
rawe humoures be loose, and then therof the lymes 
sholden be noryshed, and that were euyll. 
Forwhy in suche exercyse the kyndly hete is 
not comforted, but more febled & straunglyd, 
for the rawe humours arn dyssolued; for ryghte 
as water quencheth fyre, so rawe humores 
quenche the kynde helthe. 
 
[}Of noyes of euyll gouernau~ce.}] 
THere ben many that o~ly not vsen euyl 
gouernau~ce in metes & drynkes, but also 
strongely mayntene it, and as they seyen 
ben well at ease & wele defyen, and they scorne 
leches and other wyse men that vsen goode 
gournau~ce; for they byleue that they shold be 
excused of their errour by her longe custume. 
Forwhi custume is a full strength in kepyng 
of ma~nys body, and that sayd Galyen 
thus, custume is better defyed. Wherfore thus 
sayeth Auyceen, euyll mete vsed ys better the~ 
good mete not vsed. The contrare of all theyse 
seyth Constantyne, as yt semeth, thus; glade 
they not that vsen euyll mete, though they be 
|P 
not now hurt, after they shall not so escape. 
Herto men mowen thus sey that custume accordeth 
wyth kynde or nay, yf it accorde yt shal 
be holde~, and yf yt acordeth not & be not roted it 
shall be caste away, but not sodenly, but lytyll 
& lytyl. Forthi though it seme hem that haue 
good gouernaylle of custume, that they been 
wele by reason of custume, vertue, strengthe, 
or age, nethelesse her vertues wasten preueli, 
and so euery day they ordeyne hem to lepre or 
to sodeyn deth. As they that long time vsen 
beefe olde saltyd, or bestely fyshes, or rawe flesshe; 
or they that slepe to lityl, or exercisen to moche 
after mete, or out of mesure colde or hote, & 
so of many other; truly of suche it may be sayd, 
but yf they leue of, they shall not asterte the 
stroke of deth.
