[\f. 78\] Aries is a signe meuable, hoot and drie, of þe kynde of 
fire, colre and masculine, and of þe est partie. And Aries is þe hous 
of Mars. 
 
And he hath of a man to kepe þe hede, þe eyen, þe eren, and þe 
face. And þerfor loke þou do no medicine to þat partie þe while þe 
mone is þere and while þe mone is in þat signe. 
 
Þe man þat is bore shal be of myddel stature. And he shal haue 
faire shuldres and streight longe hoghes, and a long nekke and a 
long face, grete feet, and a sutil witte, moche heer, and smal, fairer 
shape behynde þan before, a short bodie, grete eyen, two te[{t{]h 
shall sitte aboue here felawis, and diuerse and chaungeable in wil, 
and honest in goynge. 
 
Good hit is þat tyme to do þing þat is meuable, as to bathe, to 
kutte nailes, and newe [\f. 78v\] cloþinge to were and to shape, and 
to speke with wommen and to aske of hem loue, and to mete with 
kynges, and to beye reed cloth and bras and coper and iustynge 
hors þat be reede of colour and oþer bestis and al þing þat is reede, 
and to take seruauntis, and for to go into þe est partie and þer to 
vse marchaundise. For wo-so takiþ his iourney in þat signe, he shal 
spede wel. 
 
And good hit is to beginne þinges þat is mad with fire oþer of 
fire, and for to arme shippes to go forth, and to beye armoure and 
alle maner of wepin þat is meuable for bataile, and for to blede in 
þe armes, and for to put a ship with wyn to go fro o place to anoþer, 
and to lene money, and to sette children to scole, and for to beye 
leed and yren.

But be war þat þou washe nought þine hed, ne ventouse þe 
nought in þe nekke, ne to blede at þe nose, ne to tak a wyf, ne 
castell ne toures and grete places to beginne ne non housynge, ne 
to plante trees, ne vines to sette, ne to yeue non yeftes to no lord, 
ne to aske no þing of hem, ne to go out of non prisoun, ne chartres 
of possessioun to make, ne no þing to beginne, ne to make þat þou 
woldest þat sholde dure. 

For-whi Aries is a boistows best, and þerfore take no medicine 
while þe mone is in hym. Tholomewe saith in alle þe signes þat be 
boistous, as Aries and Taurus and Capricornius and þe laste ende 
of Sagittarius, þou shalt take no medicine. For who-so takith hit 
shal caste hit ayen vp. 

And in þe risinge of þis signe he yeueth weþeringe hoot and dry.
