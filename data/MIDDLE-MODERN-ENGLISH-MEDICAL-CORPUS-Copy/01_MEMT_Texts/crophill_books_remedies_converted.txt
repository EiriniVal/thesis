[\f. 33r\] Here suys þe descripcion of þe 4 elementis & of þe 
4 complexions. And wite you wele, þat in euery man 
& woman reynys euery planet & euery syne in þe zodiak 
& ilke prime qualite & euery element & euery complexioun 
but not in al men ylike. For in som man reigneth more 
|P_183 
one þen anoþer. Þerfore men be not al of o condicion 
but of diuerse maners. Wherfore good it is þat we se shortli 
hou many prime qualitees þer be & cetera and se þe kind 
of þem. 4 prime qualitees þer ben, þat is to wite: moistnes, 
hotnes, drynes & coldnes. Moistnes & drynes 
are ij contraryes & þerfore þei may not nighe togedir 
wytouten a mene. For þe moistnes on þat on side byndis 
hem togedir, & hotnes on þat oþer side. Also hotnes & 
coldnes are to contrarious þingis. For moistnes byndis 
hem togedir on þat on side & drynes on þat oþer side. 
Moistnes is cause of euery thik substaunce & of euery 
swete taste; & þer ayen drynes is cause of euery þynne 
substaunce & euery stynking & soure taste, also of ilke rede 
[\f. 33v\] colour & large quantite. And coldnes is cause of euery white 
colour & litil quantite. Combyne þies 4 prime qualitees aftir 
þeir 4 combynacions & þen þei wil yelde 4 elementis, 
þat is to sey: Aier, fyre, erthe & watir. Ayre, moist & hote; 
Fyre, hote & dry; Erthe, dry & colde; Watir, colde & moist. 
The ayre & þe erthe are too contrarious & þerfore þei may 
not nyghe togedirs wytoute a mene, but as þe fyre 
byndis hem on þat on side bitwene hem & þe watir bitwene 
on þat oþer side. Also fyre & watir are too contraryys: 
þey mai not nyghe togedir but as þe aire byndis hem 
bitwene on þe to side & þe erthe bitwene hem byndis 
on þat oþer side. The fyre is sharppe & sotel & meneablis. 
The aire is sotel, meneable & corpulent, id est thyk. þe watir 
|P_184 
is meneable, corpulent and dulle. The erthe is dulle, corpulent 
and vnmeneable. Ryt as in an egge þe shel vmgoeth 
þe thyn skyn þat is wytin & þat skyne vmgoeth þe white 
& þe white vmgoth þe yolke and in þe myddle of þe yolke 
is a litil hole, so doth þe 4 elementis iche euer vmgoþ 
oþer, as y saide in þe first chapitre of þis descripcion. 
The fyre vmgoþ þe ayre 10 sithis more & 10 sithis 
þynner þen doþ þe ayre & cetera as is aforesaid. And so 
in þe hert of þe erthe is þe centre of þe world, þat is 
to say þe myddle point; and in þat same point is helle. 
And þer ageyn abouen þe fyre are þe sterris and abouen 
hem is heuyn cristallyne, þat is to sey watirs of al blisse 
departid in 9 ordres of aungels. þen is heven in þe 
hyest rowmest & largest. And þer ageyn is helle in þe 
lowest narowest & straitest. 
 
Right as þer are 4 elementis, so are þer 4 complexions 
according in al maner qualitees in 4 elementis. 
 
[\f. 34r\] The first is Sangwyne, þat is to sey blode gendrid in 
lyuer, thynne & like to þe Ayre. The secund is Colerik, 
gendrid in þe galle & like þer to; & it is acording to þe fyre. 
The 3 is Malincoly, gendrid in þe mylt & like to drestis 
of blode; & it acordys to þe erthe. The 4 is Flewme, 
gendrid in þe longis like to glett; & it acordis to þe watir. 
A Sangweyn man mykle may & mykil coueytis, for 
he is moist & hote. A Colerik man mykil couetis & litil 
|P_185 
may, for he is hote & drye. A Malincolyous man litil 
may & litil couetis, for he is dry & colde. A Flewmatik 
man litil couetis & mykle may, for he is colde & moist. 
A Swangweyn man is large, louyng, glad of chere, lawghing, 
rede of colour, stedfast, flesshli, righte hardy, manerly, 
gentil & wele norisshed. A Colerik man wrathful, gileful, 
fals, traiterous & righte hardi, qweynte, smal, dry 
& blak of colour. A Malyncoli man is envious, sory, couetous, 
|P_186 
hardi, fast holding þat he haþ, gileful, dredeful, slewtheful 
& of clay [{of{] colour. A Fleumatik man is slomery, 
slepy, sloweful & mykil spitting, dulle, hard of witte, 
fat of visage & white of colour. 
 
In þe yere be 4 quarters rewlid by þe 4 complexions, þat 
is to wite: Ver, Somer, Harvest, & Wynter. Ver haþ 
3 monthis, þat is Marche, Aueryl & May, and it is sangweyn 
complexioun. Somer has 3, June, July & August, and þies quarters 
are colerik complexion. Harvest has 3 also, Septembre, 
Octobre & Nouembre; þies quarters be malincolious complexioun. 
Wynter has 3, Decembre, Janyvere, & Febrere, & þies are 
fleumatik complexioun. Also euery dai thies 4 complexions 
reigneþ, þat is to wite from one after midnyghte 
til nyne of þe day reignethe Sangweyn; from 9 til 3 
[\f. 34v\] aftir myddai reignes Coleryk; from 3 aftir myddai til 
9 aftir myddai reignes Malyncoly. And from 9 aftir 
mydday til 3 aftir mydnighte reigneth Flewme. Also in þe 
4 quarters of þe World reignes þies 4 complexions, þat 
is to wite: in þe Est reignes Sangweyn complexion. In 
þe Southe reigneth Colerik. In þe West reigneth malyncoly. In þe Norþ 
|P_187 
Fleumatik. Also thies 4 complexions reigne in þe foure 
ages of man, þat is to wite: Colerik in Childhed, Sangweyn 
in manhed, Flewme in age and Malyncoli in elde. 
Childhed is from birthe til 10 yere and þen ful doone. 
Manhod from þen til 30. Age from þen til 50 yere. 
And Elde fro þen til 80, & so forthe to dethe. Also þe 
4 complexions reigne in þe 4 parties of mannys body, 
þat is to sey: Colerik reignes in al sowled lymmes, þat is 
for to 
sey fro þe brest vpward; Sangweyn reignes in al spiritual 
lymmys, þat is to sey from þe mydreff to þe wesande; 
Flewme reignes in al norisshand lymmys, þat is to sey fro 
þe reynys to þe mydreff; and malyncoly reignes 
in al gendrid lymmes, þat is for to sey fro þe reynys 
dounward. Wherefore euery mannys vryn is cast in 4 
partes, euery parte of þe vryn to his party of mannys 
bodi, þat is to vnderstond: sercle, superfiate, myddle & grounde. 
And þerfore to 4 þingis in mannys vryne men most 
take hede, þat is to sey: substaunce, quantite, colour, 
|P_188 
content. Thre substaunces þer are, þat is to wite: thykke, 
thynne & myddle. Thyk substaunce bitokneth mykill 
moistnesse, thynne mykil drynes, & myddle betokneth 
temperur. Also 3 quantitees þer are, þat is to wite: litil, 
mykle & mene. Mikil quantitees betokne gret colde, 
[\f. 35r\] and litil quantitees bitokne grete hete, and mene quantitees 
bitokne temperur. And also take hede to þe taste, wheþer it be 
swete or not, for swete taste betokneth helth & oþer bitokneth 
sikenesse. Also in vryns are xxti of þe which x betokne 
colde & x betokne hete. þe x þat betokne colde be thies. 
þe first is blak as a derk cole, & þat comys of lyued going 
bifore. þe secund is lyued like to lede. & þies 2 betokne 
mortificacion, þat is to sey qweching or fordoying of kynde 
hete thorugh al þe bodi þorow axes of colde. þe þrid 
is white like as shire watir. þe 4 is lactyk like to whay. 
þe 5 is carapos, þat is to sey like to gray russet or camels 
here. þe 6 is yalow like to falow leuys falling of trees. 
|P_189 
And þies 4 colours betokne beginnyng of digestion. Now 
we haue do þe 10 colours colde go we to þe 10 hote. þe 
first is subruff, þat is to say not ful ruff. þe 2 is ruff 
like to fyne golde. And thies 2 colours bitokne parfyt digestioun, 
so þe vryn be mydyl of substaunce, mydyl of 
quantite, swete of taste, wytoute contentis. þe 3 is subrede, 
þat is to say not ful rede. þe fourþe is rede like to saffroun 
dorte. þe 5 is subrubicunde like to a strong flawme of 
fyre. And þies 4 colours bitokne passing of digestion. þe 
7 is ynapos, þat is like to blak wyn. þe 8 is kyanos, þat 
is likened to roten blode. And þies 2 colours betokne adustion. 
þe 9 is grene like to a colestok. þe 10 is blak as 
a clere blak horne, and þies 2 betokne adustion & dethe. 
 
In vrynes are 18 contentis, þat is to wite: sercle, ampul, 
|P_190 
graynys, clowdys, skyme, attur, fattnes, humour, blode, 
grauel, heris, skalys, bran, crynoydes, sperme, dust, askis, 
sedymen or ypostas. Sercle shewis al þe qualitees 
of þe hede. Ampul, þat is to sey creme, shewis also þe 
brayne distourbled. Graynys betokne rewme & glette. 
[\f. 35v\] Clowdis shewis vi[{c{]es of þe spiritual lymmes. Skyme, þat is 
to say fome, sheweth ventosite and of þe iaundis. Attur, 
þat is to say qwittor, sheweth vices of þe reynys, þe 
bleddir or þe lyuer. Fatnes as oile dropis sheweth 
wasting & dissolucion of al þe bodi & namli of þe loynes. 
Humour like glett or like drestis of blode or like 
rotoun galle sheweth þe vice of þe mydreff or aboue 
or beneþe. Blode sheweth vice of þe lyuer or of þe bleddir 
or of þe reynys. Grauel sheweth þe stone. Here sheweth 
dissolucion of fatnes of al þe body, & namly of þe 
reynys. Scales & bran shewe skabbe of þe bleddur 
& of wasting of al þe bodi. Crynodes, þat is to sey 
resolucions grettir þen bran, shewe þe þrid spice 
|P_191 
of þe feuer etyk, þat is incurable. Sperme, þat is to sey 
mankynde, sheweth to mykle lechery. Dust sheweth

Here suyth a tretys of calculacion to know what 
þou wilt. First þou must take þe namys of men or women 
aftir as ye wil calkill. If ye wil calkil of 2 
[\f. 36r\] men feighting, to knowe wheder shal haue þe victory; 
or in stryuyng, whiche shal ouercome oþer; or of 2 folkis 
weddid, wheþer shal sonnest dye or lengest lyue; or 
of 2 folkis going any viage, wheþer shal spede or 
wheþer of þem shal come ayene; or of a sike man, 
wheþer he shal lyue or dy. Counte þe name of ech 
of thies by þe lettirs of þe A b c þat suyþ in þe 
ende of þis chapitre and be þe nombre þat is on ech 
lettir þer of, and when ye haue so doun departe al 
þe hole nombre be nyne saf of þem þat be weddid 
loke ye departe by sevyne. And by þe ouerpluis of 
þe 9 or of þe 7 ye shal se who shal sonnest forfil. 
And ye shal se by one of þies 8 rewlys who shal 
ouercome, who shal rathir dy, who shal raþer come ayene. 
And if ye wil knowe of þe sike man wheþer he shal 
lif or dy of þat siknes, take þe name of him þat is 
sike & of þe lune & of þe dai whiche he toke his 
sikenesse vpon, & counte as we haue tolde of by 
fore and if þe sike mannys name or woman ouer 
|P_193 
come he shal lyue, & if þe lune ouercome he shall dy 
wytoute any doute. For by þis experyment Alisaundre 
þe grete conquero ouercame many batailles. Wherof 
þe first rewle is þis. And one þe less shal ouercome. And 2 
he þat has 2. & 3 he þat has one shal ouercume. & 4 he þat has 
4 shal ouercume. & 5 he þat has one shal ouercume. & 6 he þat has 
6 shal ouercume. & 7 he þat has one shal ouercume. And 8 & he 
þat has 8 shal ouercume. And 9 he þat has one shal ouercume 
And 2 þe strenger shal ouercume. And 3 he þat has 3 shal 
ouercume. And 4 he þat has 3 shal ouercume. And fyue he þat 
[\f. 36v\] has 5 shal ouercume. To & he þat has 2 shal ouercume. 7 he þat has 7 
shal ouercume. And 8 he þat has 1 shal ouercume. And 9 he þat
