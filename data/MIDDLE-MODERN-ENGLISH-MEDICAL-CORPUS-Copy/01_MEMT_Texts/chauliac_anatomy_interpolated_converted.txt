[^CHAULIAC, ANATOMY (INTERPOLATED)^]

|P_3 
[\f. 36a\] GAliene þat was lanterne off ffisiciens & of Surgenes seiþ in þe 
seuentenþe boke de vtilitate particulari, in þe laste chapiter saue one. 
þat þer ben foure commodites oþer profites of þe science oþer of þe 
cunnynge off þe anothomie. 
 
þe firste & þe moste is of þe wunderfulle my3te of glorious god. 
 
þe secounde is be cause of knowing of þe partikels oþer of þe places 
of a mannes bodie þe whiche ben hurte oþer greued. 
 
þe þrid is be cause of pronosticacioun of þe dispocicioun of a mannes 
bodie þe whiche is for to cumme. 
 
But þe ferþe commodite is be cause of curacioun of seknesse oþer 
disese þat falleþ. & þerfore it is nescessaire and profitabel to euerye 
surgene to knowe his anothomie. & þerfore galien seiþ in þe begynnynge 
of his boke de interioribus þat boþe olde ffisiciens & 3unge studien 
for to knowe þe partikels and þe passiouns oþer þe diseses of 
mennes bodies, ffor-whi a man moste diuersen his cure oþer chaungen 
it after þe diuersite of þe members & after þe difference of hem, ffor as 
Rasis seiþ in toto continenti, at þe begynnynge, þat a ffisicien owe for 
to be wyse & discrete in þe knowinge of þe members þat ben in euerye 
place of a man be cause of akkeþ and disese þat falleþ in hem. 
 
And 3if it be profitabel to a ffisicien, it is moche more nescessaire to 
a surgene after þe doctrine of þe same Galiene in þe sexte boke de ingenio 
sanitatis. Surgenes þat knowe not her anothomie, þei failen ofte-tymes 
in kittynge of synewes & cordes. 
 
And 3iff a man knowe þe pocicioun oþer settinge and þe making þe 
nature oþer þe kinde in euery partikel in alle a mannes bodie, þen he 
maye li3tlye knowen when þat a man is hurte, in what place of þe bodie 
þat euer he be hurte, wheþir þat þer be sinewe oþer brawne oþer corde 
oþer ligament touched. And henricus de amonda-villa, in þe firste 
boke of his surgerie, deduceþ bi resoun þis skille and seiþe þat euerye 
craftye man is holden to knowen þe þinge þat he worchiþ inne, & elles 
he schal erren ofte-times in his worchinge. But a surgene is a man of 
crafte of hele of mannes bodie, wher-fore he is holden to knowe þe 
nature & þe compocicioun of þe bodie, and so be consequens he is holden 
to knowe þe anothomie of a man, þe whiche resoun is confermed 
by licklynesse, ffor in þe same maner worcheþ a blynde man in a tree 
|P_4 
& a Surgene in a manes bodie when þat a Surgene knoweþ not [\f. 36b\] his 
anothomie, but a blynde man, 3if he hewe a tree, erreþ ofte-tymes, 
takynge eiþer more oþer lesse þen he schulde of þe same tree, and ri3te 
so doeþ a Surgen when þat he knoweþ not his anothomie. And þerfor 
Galien likenþe sucche Surgenes to euyl cokes, of þe whiche he spekeþ 
off in þe secounde boke de Ingenio sanitatis, in þe whiche boke he seiþ 
þat cokes kitten not eche ioynte one after anoþer, but þei grynden and 
brissen & wasten alle at ones. 
 
And þerfore it foloweþ þat it is nedeful to ffisiciens, and namelye to 
Surgens, to knowen here anothomie. and it is nescessarie to a Surgen 
also to knowen wiþ his anothomye þre þinges, þe whiche ben rotes and 
elementes of alle medicacioun, þat is to seien, þe anothomie, þe doinge, 
and þe profite off þe members, as Galien deduceþ conuenientlye, 
libro.primo interiorum. þer-fore, sparinge lengþe and tristinge þat 
oþer autours of medicyne treted fullye of þe anothomie, as Galien in 
seuentene tretys de vtilitate particulari. fforwhy, as Haly witnesseþ in 
þe laste ende off tegni, þat þe toþer fiftene tretys þat he made of þe 
anothomie ben not 3itte translated. 
 
And Haly abbas tretiþ also off þe anothomye in þe firste partie of 
his boke de dispocicione regali, in þe secounde sermoun and in þe 
þrid. 
 
And auycen in his canoun, in þe firste boke, treteþ off þe anothomye 
also. And þerfore it nedeþ not to setten here but a grete and a materiel 
anothomie þe whiche mowe deducen oþer leden a Surgene þat worcheþ 
& techen hym how he schal knowe in what place a man schal be kitte 
and howe þat members owen to ben reduced, 3if þei be oute of her 
owne place oþer oute of liþthe. 
 
fforsoþe, anothomie is a ri3t diuisioun and determinacioun of þe 
members of a mannes bodie oþer of what oþire bodie þat it be, but alle 
þe intencioun of þe writynge of þe anothomye is be cause of mannes 
bodie, for alle þe crafte of Surgerye is maad be cause of þe entencioun 
off mannes bodie. 
 
And þis word anothomia is seide of þis worde ano, þat is it to seyen, 
ri3t oþer euen, and of þis worde thomas, þat is to seien, departinge, as a 
ri3te diuisioun oþer a ri3te departinge. 

|P_5 
Anothomie is founden in two maners: þe tone is bi doctryne of 
bokes, þe whiche manere, alle 3if þat it be profitabel, 3it it is not sufficient 
[\f. 37a\] for to tellen openlye þo þinges þat be knowen to mennes wittes 
allonelye, as Galien seiþ in þe ei3tene chapiter of þe firste boke de vtilitate 
particulari. And þerfore Aueroys seide in þe first boke off Colliget: 
We make not schort to speke of þe anothomye but be cause þat 
oure ymaginacioun is schorte in sucche þingis and litil in comparisoun 
of þo þingis þat ben in þe anothomie. 
 
þe toþer maner of ffyndinge of þe anothomye is þur3 experience of 
dede bodies; we haue experience off oure anothomye in bodies þat 
ben newe dede, þe whiche bodies ben heded oþer honged and at þe 
leste we fynde in hem þe anothomye of þe Official members wiþ-inne 
þe bodie and off þe flesche and þe brawnes & of þe skinne and off 
manye veynes and off Synewes, and þat namelye of þe begynnynge of 
hem, as Mundyne of boloyne treteþ, þe whiche Mundyne wrote a boke 
of þe anothomye, and did it in dede ofte-tymes with his owne hondes, 
and he did in þis maner: ffirste he leide þe dede bodie on a stoke and 
made foure lessons þeroff In þe first he treted off þe nutritiue 
members, for-whie þeie wille sunnest rote. 
 
In þe secounde he treted off þe spirituel members. 
 
In þe þrid he treted of þe quycke oþer liffelye members. 
 
And in þe ferþe he treted off þe extremites of a man, and þer owe 
nyne þingis for to be knowen oþere vnderstonden in euerye member, 
þat is to seien, þe pocicioun oþer þe settinge, þe substaunce, þe complexioun, 
þe quantite, þe noumber, þe ffigure, þe knyttinge, and þe vtilite 
oþer þe profite þer-off. And whiche sekenesse mowe falle to a 
mannes bodie. þe whiche a Surgene maie helpe bi knowinge of þe 
anothomye and by pronosticacioun and also by curacioun. 
 
Also we haue experience of þe anothomye in bodies þe whiche ben 
dried in þe sunne oþer consumed in þe erþe oþer wasted oþere made 
smoþe in rynnyng water oþer boylynge water, and namelye of bones 
and grustelles, ioyntes, synewes & grete brawnes, and off ligamentes. 
And so come Galien to þe knowinge of þe anothomye þoru3 þe si3te 
off dede bodies of menne & apes and swyne & of manye oþere bestes, 
& not be peinting[{es{] as þe forseide henry did, þat semed for to 
schewe alle þe anothomye [\f. 37b\] wiþ þrettene ymages depeynted / 
 
|P_6 
And þer-fore it scheweþ in alle medicyne be cause þat medicyne 
makeþ mencioun þer-off, what a mannes bodie is. 
 
It semeþ þat a bodie is one hole þinge, made feire by resoun, compounde 
of manye dyuerse members oþer partikels. 
 
And a member oþer a partikel, as galien seiþ in þe firste boke de vtilitate 
particulari, is a maner bodie þe whiche is not allinges disseuerde 
oþer departed, neiþer ioyned to anoþer; and it is seide in þe same 
place þat summe ben lesse and summe ben more, þe whiche ben indiuisibel 
oþer vndepartabel in-to enye oþere lick-nesse. And þat is þe 
same þat auycen seiþ bi oþere wordis in his Canoun, in his firste boke, 
þat members ben bodies þe whiche ben engenderde of þe first commixtioun 
of humours; and it foloweþ þat summe members ben simpel 
and summe ben compounde, speking of simpel and of compounde as a 
surgen considereþ largelye. And þo þat simpel beþ liche members, þe 
whiche þat ben not departabel in-to anoþer liknesse, but howe-þat-euer 
it take enye sensibel partie, it schal haue comunicacioun to alle in name 
& resoune. and þei ben .xj., þat is to seyen, gristelle, bone, synewe, veines, 
arteries, pannykels, ligamentes, cordes, skynne, and fleische, and 
fatnesse. & here and nayles ben noumberde wiþ hem þat, alle 3if it so 
be þat þeie be not proprelye members but superfluites. 3it þeie haue 
summe manere vtilite and regeneracioun as members, as it is seide in 
þe secounde partie of tegni; & summe of þes ben sanguine, in þe whiche 
þer is nature and generacioun & consolidacioun be cause þat þeie 
ben engenderde of blode, as flesche and fatnesse, & summe ben spermatik, 
fforwhye þei haue here begynnynge of þe sperme, in þe whiche 
þer is neiþer regeneracioun neiþer consolidacioun, þat is to seyen, verreie, 
as bones and alle oþer members fro þe forseide. 
 
More-ouer, summe of þe simpel members ben hote and moiste, 
summe colde and moiste, & summe colde and drye. But þere be no 
members cleped hote and drye, forwhi þer is no member founden 
simpellye hotter and drier þen þe skynne, þat is to seyen, ouer þe 
nature off þe skynne, to þe whiche alle oþer members ben lickende; 
for þe skynne is a mene not allonelye of mennes partikels, but also of 
alle þe substaunce þat is engenderde and corupte, as galien seiþ in þe 
firste boke de complexionibus, in þe laste chapiter, þat blode and 
spirite & fleische ben members þe whiche ben hote & moiste; and 
naturel humidites kepen [\f. 38a\] hem, as Aueroys seiþ in þe secounde partie 
of his Colliget. and flewme and fatnesse and marie ben colde & 
moiste. 
 
But alle þe toþer members ben colde and drye aftir her degree, as 
|P_7 
bone, gristille, here, cordes, ligamentes, synewes, veynes, and pannikels. 
And here is a see in þe whiche it is not leffulle to a Surgene to 
rowe inne, ffor it is a-cordinge to a Surgene to resceyue þe complexioun 
of þo members off a naturele philosofer. 
 
Members þat ben compounde ben þo þat ben made off þe forseide 
simpel members oþer like members, and þer-fore þeie maie be departed 
in-to oþer liknesse, forwhye euerye partie of liche members kepeþ not 
þe resoun of alle þe hole. 
 
And þei be cleped Organica & instrumentalia, fforwhie þei be þe 
instrumentes of þe soule, as þe hondes, þe face, þe herte, and þe liuer. 
And þer-fore galien seiþ in þe secounde boke de vtilitate particulari, in 
þe laste chapiter, þat nature ordeyned & made alle þe partikels oþer 
alle þe parties off þe bodie abel to þe vertues and þe maners of þe soule. 
 
And summe of þes ben principalle and summe be not principalle; 
þe principal ben þe herte and þe lyuer, þe brayne and þe ballockes, and 
alle oþere members be clepid not principal. 
 
& summe off þes ben lesse, as þe y3e, þe nose, þe litel honde. 
And summe be gretter, as þe hede, þe visage, þe necke, þe schulder, 
and þe toþer ei3te, in þe whiche alle þe bodye is departed, as to speke 
off at þis tyme by grace off Cirurgicale doctrine. And alle 3if þat þes 
organike oþer principale members be compounde of manye dyuerse 
þoru3 grace off accioun and off passioun of hem wiþ dewe quantite & 
qualite þoru3 vniuersel plasmacioun oþer fourme, neþeles, one simpel 
and liche a-twixe hem is þe begynnynge of alle doynge. and þe toþer 
ben ordeyned be cause of vtilite oþer off profite, ffor summe of hem 
be ordeyned be cause þat a man schulde done alle þinge þe better by 
hem, And oþer ben ordeined wiþ-outen whom it were inpossibel þo 
doinges to be done. And oþere ben ordeined for þe kepinge of alle 
þes, as galien deduceþ of þe vtilite of a mannes hondes, in þe firste tretys 
& þe secounde de vtilitate particulari; and be consequent he tretiþ 
aftirwarde of alle oþer members in þe same boke, so þat þou maye 
vndirstonde, as he seiþ in þe ferþe boke, þat þer is no partye of no beste 
made in veyne neiþer idelle, but þat it moste nedelinges be so wiþ 
conuenient complexioun & compocicioun, [\f. 38b\] in þe whiche members 
god haþ 3euen hem diuine vertues, þe whiche ben departed boþe in 
compound members and in sympel members of þe Elementes. 
 
fforwhi þe herte, þe whiche is þe first organik oþer principal member, 
þe whiche is made off ligamentes and pannikels and of harde, 
brawny fleische, is cleped drye be cause of multitude of spirites þe whiche 
ben in þe harte, and be cause þat it is, as it were, a firy fourneys of 
|P_8 
alle þe bodie, þerfore it is cleped hote. Phisiciens arguen and seien þat 
þe herte is hote & drye. but philosofers seien þat it declineþ towarde 
hete and moistenesse and þat it is temperate be cause þat it is þe begynnynge 
of liyf. 
 
But forto speke off þe beynge of þe liuer, it semeþ þat it is hote and 
moiste, for þe more partie of þe parties of þe liuer is fleschie and blodie, 
and þer-wiþ þer ben manye arteries sente to hym. 
 
And þe brayne is colde and moiste, alle 3if þat it haue a mary substaunce. 
but 3it þer is a difference a-twixe þe marye and þe braine, for 
þe humidite, þe whiche is cleped cerebellaris, cummeþ of þe sperme 
and it is cleped hote as in kynde, as þe philosofer seiþ in þe secounde 
partie of þe boke off bestes. 
 
But þe splene and þe reynes ben also off þo members whiche ben 
hote and moiste, alle 3if þat þe Reines be sumdel in degree vnder þe 
splene oþer þe milte be cause of gretnesse of blode þat stondeþ in þe 
splene, as þe splene in þe same degre is myche lower þen þe lyuer. 
 
And þe fleische off þe lunges is sette moche moisterr þen þe fatnesse, 
for it is not 3et oute when it is chaufed, as Galien seiþ, vbi supra, And it 
is cleped hote be cause þat it is norisched of more sotil blode sente fro 
þe herte to him, as þe same galien seide in þe ferþe partye de vtilitate 
particulari; and so per consequens moste a man consider off þe complexioun 
of oþere members þe whiche ben compounde, þat þei ben off 
sucche complexioun as resulteþ oþer riseþ vpp of oþer members þat 
cumme to hem & þat makeþ hem. 
 
[}þe secounde chapiter is off þe anothomye of þe skynne, and of þe fatnesse, 
of þe fleische, and off þe brawnes.}] 
Firste y wille begynne at þe skine for it renneþ-to firste for to make 
þe anothomye. 
 
þe skynne is a coueringe of þe bodie, wouen to-gider of þe þredes of 
synewes and off veynes and of arteries, fourmed oþer [\f. 39a\] made for diffendinge 
and 3euynge off felinge; Of þe whiche skynne þer ben .ij. 
maner, ffor summe couereþ þe members with-out, and þat is cleped þe 
skynne properlye, of þe whiche þer ben fyue difference noted in þe 
elleuenþe partie de vtilitate particularie in þe fifte chapiter. 
 
And þer is a-noþer maner of skynne, þe whiche couereþ þe members 
|P_9 
wiþ-inne, & þat is cleped properlie a pannikel. as þe teye off þe braine 
and pericraneum, þat couereþ þe brayne panne, & oþere skynnes þat 
couer þe bones and þe cyphac and þe skynne of þe herte, & þe pannykels 
of alle þe bowelles of a mannes bodie. 
 
þe vtilite off þe temperaunce of þe skynne in his qualites was be 
cause þat it schulde fele attemperellye, for-why, 3if it had excellent 
felinge, as a simpel sinewe haþe, a man mi3te neiþer gone in excellent 
colde neiþer in excellent hete; þe vtilite of þe creacioun and off þe 
sensibilite of þe skynne was be cause þat alle þe bodie, þat is lapped 
aboute wiþ þe skynne, schulde not be greued vnwetinglie off sensibel 
ennoys. 
 
þen foloweþ fatnesse after, and it is ane oile þat chaufeþ & moisteþ 
þe members, of þe whiche þer ben .ij. maners. one-wiþ-oute nexte þe 
skynne, þe whiche is properlye cleped [{adeps, and an oþer wyth-inne 
besyde þe wombe and [{ þe{] Reynys, the wheche ys properly cleped {] 
axungia. 
 
þe vtilite oþer þe profite of alle þes maner fatnesse is for þre þinges. 
 
þe first is þat þe members þat be lapped in hem mowe be 
streng[{þed{] bi hem boþe in attraccioun and retencioun. 
 
þe secounde, þat oþere drie members þat be nye hem, as þe Reynes 
and oþer sucche, mowe ben moisted þur3 her vnctuosite and her humidite. 
 
þe þrid is þat summe members mowe be holden fro colde by hem. 
 
þen foloweþ after fleische, of þe whiche þer ben þre maners, þat is 
forto seien, simpel & pure fleische, of þe whiche þer is founden but 
litel, and þat namelie in þe heued of þe 3erde & a-twixe þe teþe. 
 
And þer is anoþer maner fleische, þe whiche is glandulous, as fleische 
of þe ballockes and þe pappes & of þe arme pittes & þe gryndes. 
 
But þe þrid fleische is musculous oþer lacertous, þat is to seien, 
brawny, and þer is moche þer-off, and it is founden þoru3-oute alle þe 
bodie wher-þat-euer þer is open meuynge and electiue. 
 
þe vtilite of fleische as in comune is for þre skilles. þe firste is be 
cause þat it defendeþ þe bodie fro colde as cloþes done. 
 
þe secounde is because þat it [\f. 39b\] defendeþ þe bodie fro harde þinges 
þat rennen oþer fallen to þe bodie for it a3ene-stondeþ hem. 
 
|P_10 
þe þrid is be cause of his moistnes þat he maye cole oþere make 
colde þe bodie in somer. 
 
þe vtilite off nesche fleische is for two skilles. 
 
þe firste is þat he mowe fille þe concauites. and þe inwarde places 
of oþere liche members þat þei mowe be of ffeire schappe 
 
þe secounde is þat oþere liche members, þe whiche ben harde. frote 
not to-gidere wiþ-outen a mene. þe vtilite of harde viscous fleische is 
contened in þe anothomie of þe brawnes of þe armes. 
 
Also þer ben þre vtilites off glandulous fleische. 
 
þe firste is þat it mowe conuerten þe blood to colour liche to him, as 
þe fleische off þe pappes and þe ballokes conuerteþ þe blood to white 
colour. 
 
þe secounde vtilite is be cause þat he mowe drawe and resceiue in his 
rarite þe superfluites of þe principal members, as off þe liuer and 
oþere sucche. 
 
þe þrid vtilite is be cause þat it may ben a reste oþer a restinge place 
off þe veines þat gone fro member to member. 
 
þe brawne is ane organe oþer a begynner of manifeste oþer open 
and electiue meuynge, as galien seiþ & treteþ þoru3-oute alle his boke 
de vtilitate particulari. 
 
And alle 3if þat brawnes as to a mannes felinge be simpel members, 
neuer-þe-lesse, in soþefastnesse þeie ben compounde of sinewes and 
ligamentes and filled wiþ softe fleische and couerde wiþ a pannykel. 
and herto accordeþ auycen in þe firste canoun off his boke. Musculus 
and lacertus ben boþe one, þat is to seien, a brawne, but musculus is 
cleped so at þe similitude off a Mouse, and lacertus is cleped so at þe 
similitude off a lesarde, for boþe þes bestes ben smale at eiþer ende and 
longe, namelie towarde þe taile, & þeie ben grete in þe midwarde, and 
so ben Muscules oþer lacertes, alle 3if þat it seme þat henricus de 
Armonda-villa assigne a difference a-twixe hem. 
 
And þerfore þou schalte note after þe intencioun of galien þoru3-oute 
alle his boke de vtilitate particulari. þat after þat þe brawne is 
compounde, as it is seide, þer descenden fro him rounde cordes & ligamentes, 
and whyle þei cumme nei3 þe ioyntours, þei spreden abrode & 
bynden þe ioyntes alle aboute wiþ a pannikel wiþ hem þat couereþ þe 
bones.and þo cordes & þo ligamentes meuen þe ioyntes. and when þei 
|P_11 
be passed þe ioyntes, þei wexen rounde a3eine and ben reduced in-to a 
corde, & with fleisch [\f. 40a\] þeie maken anoþer brawne. & 3it þer passeþ 
oute of him a corde & a ligament and ben spredde a-brode and bynden 
þe ioynte þat foloweþ nexte alle a-boute & meueþ it. & so it seseþ not 
to þat it cumme to þe laste partikels; and so þe brawne goþ euermore 
a-fore þe ioynte & a-forne þe member þat it meueþ, and þat is declared 
in þe armes. 
 
þe sinewes þat be sente fro þe nucha of þe necke to þe armes taken 
þe schappe of þe brawne in þe necke and þe breste; & in þe comynge 
to þe iuncture of þe schulder þer is casten a corde & spredde o-brode 
and comprehendeþ oþer takeþ alle þe ioynte, & is sette in þe bone of 
þe schulder and meueþ him; and when he passeþ oute of þe ioynte of 
þe schulder two finger brede oþer þre, it wexeþ rounde a3eine & is 
reduced in-to a corde; and wiþ fleische and ligament þat goþ fro þe 
heued of þe schulder bone it makeþ brawnes aboue þe middewarde of 
þe grete arme, of þe whiche þer passeþ oute a corde, þe whiche wexeþ 
widder þre fynger brede aboue þe elbowe & comprehendes alle þe 
elbowe & meueþ þe litil arme. 
 
Adiutorium is cleped þe grete arme, þat is to seien, þat spase þat is 
atwixe þe schulder and þe elbowe, and þen þre fyngers aftir þat it 
wexeþ rounde a3eine. & is reduced into a corde, þe whiche enterþ with 
þe ligament þat goþ out fro þe elbowe, and wiþ fleische it makeþ brawnes 
aboue þe mydwarde of þe litil arme, of þe whiche þer goþ oute a 
corde, þe whiche, þre finger brede fro þe ioynte of þe honde, wexeþ 
widder and comprehendeþ alle þe ioynte off þe honde. & þen wexeþ 
rounde and enterþ a brawne a3eine in þe midwarde of þe honde, of þe 
whiche þer gone oute cordes, þe whiche meuen þe fyngers. þerfore 
þou schalt wele knowe þat woundes þat ben but þre fynger brede fro 
þe ioyntes ben perilouse, for þe neruous cordes þat ben in þat place 
ben bare of fleische & scheuyng. 
 
And 3if a man be pricked in þat place, it engenderþ a craumpe, and 
þen per consequens deþ foloweþ aftir, as galien seiþ in þe þrid parte of 
tegni. & in þe þrid partikel de ingenio sanitatis. 
 
þe brawnes, bi þe autorite of haly abbas in þe firste partie of his boke, 
in þe þrid sermoun, haue a difference in fyue þingis: in quantite, in 
figure, in pocicioun oþer setting, in compocicioun & in þe begynnynge 
off þe cordes; and þerfore galien seiþ in þe sexte partie de vtilitate 
particulari þat þer ben foure pociciouns oþere settinges of brawnes. 
þat [\f. 40b\] is to seien, one þat is euen. anoþer of trauers. and two þat 
ben croked. 

|P_12 
And alle þe brawnes of a man ben in noumber .531. as Auycen seiþ 
in his firste boke of þe anothomye of þe brawnes þe vtilites off þe creacioun 
and of þe complexioun of þe brawnes schal be schewed in þe 
anothomie off þe armes. 
 
[}þe þrid chapiter is of þe anothomie of sinewes, ligamentes, and of 
cordes}] 
BE cause þat brawnes ben compounde of nerues & of ligamentes 
and off fleische it is to speke of hem after þe anothomie of Musculous 
fleische. 
 
þe sinewe is a simpel member fourmed oþer made for to 3eue felinge 
and meuynge to þe brawnes & to oþere partikels, and þerfore galien in 
þe ferþe boke de vtilitate particulari, in þe laste chapiter, seid þat þer 
ben þre intenciouns of kinde of distribucioun oþer 3euyng of sinewes. 
 
þe firste is be cause of grace of felinge in þe organes oþer instrumentes 
of a man þe whiche ben sensitiue oþer felinge 
 
Anoþer is be cause of meuyng in þo instrumentes þat ben motiue 
oþer steringe. A-noþer is 3euen in alle oþer members to þe vnknowinge 
of þinges þat my3te feren hem oþer make hem sorie. And 
galien seide wele in sensitiues, þat is to seiden, felinge, ffor-whi sinewes 
be not inplanted to gristels, neiþer to bones, neiþer to many oþere 
glandulous flesshes, but þe sinewes semen enplanted to þe teþe, as 
galien seide in þe sextene boke afore-nemnede. 
 
Alle þe sinewes haue here begynnyng oþer schewinge of þe braines 
bi him selfe oþer of þe nucha, þe whiche is þe vicaire off þe braines, 
and her-to accordeþ alle þe comune scole of phisiciens and of leches. 
fforsoþe, summe sinewes growen oute of þe forþer partie of þe braines, 
& þo sinewes ben softe and redy for to 3eue felinge / 
 
And summe sinewes growen oþer proceden oute of þe hinder partie 
out of þe nuca, þe whiche descendeþ fro þe braine, & þo sinewes 
ben harder & more schewinge to felinge. 
 
And wheþer þat felinge & meuynge be borne be one synewe oþer be 
diuerse sinewes, it semeþ þat galien holdeþ in þe firste boke de interioribus. 
and in þe ferþe boke de morbo & accidenti. & þe same galien 
seiþ þat sum tyme felinge & meuynge ben borne furþ bi one 
|P_13 
sinewe. and summe tyme by diuerse sinewes. & þe scole of mountpellers 
holdeþ þe same resoun. þe mater is hard, and it is harder forto 
musen oþer for to studie her-apon wheþer þat þe forseide sinewes ben 
borne substancially [\f. 41a\] oþer radicaly. 
 
Howe-þat-euere it be, þer ben seuene peire of Synewes þe whiche 
growen oute off þe braine anone furþewiþ, and oþer þrettye þe whiche 
grown bi þe midwarde of þe nucha, and one wiþ-outen felowe þe whiche 
groweþ at þe ende of þe ossarium, as haly abbas seiþ in þe 
secounde partie of þe firste boke regalis dispocicionis. 
 
Ligamentes ben of þe nature oþer off þe kinde of sinewes, but 
naþelesse þei growen oute of þe bones, of þe whiche þer ben two 
maners. for sum ligamen[{tes{] bynde þe bones wiþ-inne. and summe 
ligamentes bynde þe bones wiþ-oute, as alle þe ioynte, and so seide 
Galien in þe .xij. boke de vtilitate particulari, in þe first chapiter, þe 
articulacioun of bones is comprehended alle aboute wiþ stronge. remissiue 
ligamentes. 
 
Cordes oþer tenantos, þe whiche beþ alle one, ben also of þe kinde 
of sinewes & more þen [{þe{] ligamentes. ffor-whie as þe ligamentes 
ben mene atwixe synewes and bones: so ben cordes menes atwixe sinewes 
and ligamentes. 
 
þe cordes growen oute of þe braines and taken her felinge of þe sinewes 
and her meuyng, with þe which þe members ben meued. and as it 
is seide a-forne, alle 3if þei be rounde when [{þei leue{] þe brawnes, 
þei wexen euer brodder and bradder as þei cumme to þe ioyntes. & þei 
be sette so aboute þe member þat þe cordes þat ben wiþ-inne drawen þe 
member. and þe cordes wiþoute extenden oþer strecchen oute þe member, 
but what time þat þe tone draweþ: þe toþer is relaxed; and 
þerfore, 3if þe member be kitte wiþ-oute: þe member maye not bowen 
aftirwarde, and 3if þe member be kitte wiþ-inne: þe member maie not 
be strecched oute. and so seiþ galien in þe firste boke & in þe .xij. de 
vtilitate particulari. 
 
þe vtilite off þe creacioun of sinewes in a mannes bodie is be cause 
þat alle þe members schulde meuen & fele. 
 
þe vtilite of þe creacioun of ligamentes is for foure skilles. þe firste 
|P_14 
is þat it mowe geder to-gidere diuerse bones. forwhy it is nescessaire 
þat manye bones susteine one bodie & one member wiþ-outen anoþer 
3if þat it be nede. 
 
þe secounde vtilite is þat it be compounde wiþ sinewes be cause of þe 
compocicioun oþer makinge of cordes & brawnes. 
 
þe þrid vtilite is be cause þat þei schulde ben a sege & a resting place 
& a matras of summe sinewes in þe ioyntes. 
 
þe ferþe vtilite [\f. 41b\] is for þat summe members þat ben wiþ-inne þe 
bodie, þat neden for to honge, mowe ben honged bi hem, as þe 
matrice; and þe vtilite of þe flexibilite oþer of þe bowinge of a ligament 
was be cause þat one member mi3te meuen wiþouten an oþer. 
 
þe vtilite of þe vnsensibilite of him was be cause þat he schulde not 
hurte oþer ben hurte wiþ mochil meuynge. 
 
þe vtilite of cordes & of þe creacioun of hem schal be schewed in þe 
anothomie of þe armes. 
 
[}þe ferþe chapiter is of þe anothomye of veines and arteries.}] 
Alle 3if þat veines & arteries after þe entencioun of Galien in þe xvj. 
boke de vtilitate particulari be not alle one, oþer þat þer be a difference 
atwixe hem, as speking of þe principal oþer of þe begynnynge of hem, 
fforwhie veines growen out of þe liuer, & arteries oute of þe harte, and 
in summe place veines ben disseuerd fro arteries, as in þe open oþer 
schewinge place of þe arme & in rethe mirabili. but þer [{is{] none arterie 
founden wiþ-outen veine, as who seie, in alle þe bodie after, and þei 
haue boþe liche comunicacioun & distribucioun, and þer-fore it 
sufficeþ to a Surgene for to haue hem boþe comprehended in one sermoune 
at ones, and so did Galien in þe place aforseide. 
 
What is a veine[{? –{] no þing elles but a norischinge place of blode 
oþer a place þat norisscheþ blode. And what is ane arterie[{? -{] no 
þing elles but a place of spirituel blode; and þat is knowen to alle phisiciens 
& surgenes. and þes vesselles, at þe passinge oute at her 
begynnynge, þei ben fourched oþer forked, & one partie goeþ vpwarde 
and a-noþer partie goeþ dounwarde, & eiþer partie is ramified oþere 
braunched and in his braunchinge deduced oþer ledde to þe extremites 
off þe bodie for to norische & to quiken alle þe particuler members. 
 
þoo veines þat schewen perile, when þei ben kitte, for to grete emorosogie, 
|P_15 
þat is to seien, for to mochil bledinge, schal ben schewed in þe 
anothomie of þe grete members. 
 
þer ben þre vtilites of þe creacioun off arteries in a mannes bodie. 
 
þe first is þat þur3 dilatacioun oþer openynge of hem þe eire mowe 
be drawen to þe harte be cause off refrigerie oþer of kolinge. 
 
þe secounde is þat fumosite mowe be expelled fro þe herte þoru3 
constriccioun of hem. 
 
þe þrid is be cause þat blode & hete and spirit of life maie be diffounded 
oþer sent to alle þe members off þe bodie bi þe arteries; [\f. 42a\] þe vtilite 
of þe creacioun of þe veines was be cause þat þei schulden bere 
norisshinge fro þe liuer to oþer members off þe bodie. 
 
[}þe fifte chapiter is off þe anothomie of bones, gristilles, nailes, & 
heres.}] 
ÞE anothomie of þe bones is tolde last, for þei ben in þe depe parties 
of þe bodie. and þe bones ben þe hardest partikels of alle þe bodye. and 
þei ben þe fundement and þe vppeholders of alle oþere parties of a 
mannes bodie Also þer-wiþ summe of hem ben made for þe kepinge 
of þe parties wiþinne, as þe brayne panne, þe breste, & þe backe 
 
And 3if þe bones of a mannes bodie be wele a-counted, as auicen 
telleþ in þe first of his canoun, þer ben .248. bones, wiþ-outen þo bones 
þat ben cleped Sisannia and þe bone þat is cleped os laude, in þe 
whiche þe tunge is founded inne 
 
þe bones off þe bodie resseiuen diuersites after þe noumber and þe 
fourme in manye maners. Summe bi resoun of hem self and oþer bi 
resoun of þe ioyntes haue diuersite in hem, for-whie summe bones ben 
marowie, and summe bones haue marie in hem. 
 
Also summe bones ben euen, & summe bones ben croked. and 
summe bones ben litil, & summe bones ben grete, and alle maner of 
bones ben gretter at þe ioynte þen amidwarde; be cause of þe ioyntes 
þei haue diuersites, for summe haue addiciouns entringe, & summe 
haue voidnes res[{cei{]uynge, and summe haþe þe tone and þe toþer. 
& summe neiþer þe tone, neiþer þe toþer. And þo bones þat haue þe 
|P_16 
addiciouns & þe voidenes a-foreseide, summe ben clauales, as þe teþe, 
& summe ben serratiles, þat is to seien, liche to a sowe, as is þe 
braine panne, & summe knottye in eiþer hede, as þe vlna. þat is, the 
arme boon, and þe þye. & summe bones ben pittye, as þe 
fosciles, & summe haue boþe þe tone and þe toþer, as þe fyngers. 
& þo bones þat failen boþe þe tone & þe toþere, þei ben ioyned, as þei 
weren souded to-gider. & sucche bones þat haue sucche roundenesse 
and holes, þeie maken properlie a ioynte, to þe whiche ioyntes þer 
falleþ properlye dislocacioun, and to þe toþer separacioun. 
 
þe grustille is, as it were, off þe nature of bone, & it is made for to 
fulfille þe diffaute of þe bone, as in þe y3e liddes and in þe nose-þrilles 
& þe eres, and at þe coniunccioun of bones maie be þe better for 
him, when þei nei3e to-gidere, as in þe breste and in þe haunches & in 
þe extremitees of hem, þat þei take none harme. [\f. 42b\] neiþer be not wasted 
when þei meue to-gidere. Also þe grustil is softer þen þe bone. 
 
þe vtilite off þe creacioun of þe grustille in a mannes bodie is for 
sexe skilles. 
 
þe firste skille is þat þer schulde be no continuacioun of harde bone 
wiþ softe members wiþ-outen a middel mene. 
 
þe secounde skille, for þat softe members schulde not ben hurte of 
harde members in tyme off contucioun and compressioun 
 
þe þrid skille is þat þe extremites of þe bones off þe ioyntes. þe whiche 
ben grustillie, mowe froten li3tlye to-gider 
 
þe ferþe skille is be cause þat it was nessessarie for to fichen oþer stiken 
inne a member þat is summe dele harde and grustille þat is 
cleped cimbalaris, as in þe wesaunde. 
 
þe fifte skille is for þat it was nescessaire þat summe members 
waren boned & susteined and made more large, as þe eres & þe nose-þrilles, 
& c. and alle þes my3te not ben perfournisched in þe same wiþ-outen 
a Mene of grustille. 

|P_17 
þe sexte skille is þat þe grustille mowe fulfille þe office of þe bone, 
susteynynge summe brawnes þat meuen summe maner members, as in 
þe ouer y3e lidde. 
 
þe nayles be made in þe extremites of members for þat a man maie 
take þe better wiþe hem; þe heres ben made for to make a man faire 
& forto purgen. 
 
þe vtilite off þe creacioun of nailes was ordeined in summe bestes 
þat it schulde be to hem as it were armour. 
 
þe vtilite why þat þe naile is neiþer to harde neiþer to nesche is for 
þis skille, for 3if it were to harde, it wolde li3tlye breke, and 3if it were 
to nesche, a man schulde not holde li3tlye þat he cau3te þer-wiþ. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat þe nailes ben in þe extremites of a man is be cause 
þat it schulde conserue þe extremites, as it were an yren ringe oþer as 
ane hefte. 
 
And þe cause whi þat þei be wiþ-oute-forþe & nou3t with-inne is be 
cause þat it maie wiþ-stonden manye ennoyes þat fallen. 
 
þe vtilites whi þat it is not in þe parties wiþ-inne is be cause þat it 
schulde not lette þe touchinge of þo parties þe vtilite whi þat þe nailes 
aumenten o-lengþe. for 3if þei growe not o-lengþe, þei schulde alle 
vtterlie faile with alle her operaciouns. 
 
Also þer ben þre causes whi þat þei ben sumdel bowed. þe first 
cause is þat þei mowe take & holde þe better. 
 
þe secounde cause is þat a man mai clawe him wiþ hem when þat 
he iccheþ. 
 
þe þrid skille is þat he maie breke oþer kitte wiþ his nailes enye 
maner þinge when þat it is nedfulle. 
 
[\f. 43a\] þe vtilite whi þat þe nayles be rounde is be cause þat þeie schulde 
wiþ-stonde þe better ennoies þat comen from wiþ-oute-furþe. þe vtilite 
of þe here schal be schewed in þe chapiter of þe heued. 
 
[}þe secounde doctrine of þe anothomye is off members þat ben compounde

& summe lesse, as it is seide afore, Neþeles, þe anothomie of hem 
schal ben treted in ei3te chapiters after þe diuisioun of þe gretter partikels 
of a mannes bodie be cause þat sucche sensibel diuisioun is moste

|P_18

þe secounde is comune to þe same heued and to þe necke, of þe whiche 
y schal speke in þe necke. 
 
þe quantite of þe same braine panne is off grete capacite. seþ þat þe 
braine of a man is more þen of oþere bestes þat ben of euen quantite 
 
þe schappe of him is rounde, liche to a spere, compressed doun li3tlye

þer ben tenne oþer elleuen parties of þe braine panne, as auicen

I haue spoken ynou3 a-forne of here and skinne and musculous fleische. 
And as touchinge þe grete pannikel þat Galien clepeþ pericranen,

Anone after, þer is founden þe bone þat is cleped þe braine panne, 
and it is not alle hole a bone, but it is ordeined of seuene bones, so þat, 
3if þer felle disese in one, it schulde not passe to a-noþer; and it is 
ioyned wiþ commissures liche to a sawe þat [\f. 44a\] þe vapoures mowe

þe first bone of þe braine panne þat is in þe forþ[{er{] partie off þe 
heued is cleped coronale, þat lasteþ fro þe midwarde of þo bones þat 
ben cleped orbite vn-to þe commissures þat gone o-trauers þe braine

þe nose-þrilles also, and þeie ben departed bi ane addicioun of bone, 
made in þe maner of a creste off ane henne, fro þe whiche þe gristille 
þat parteþ þe nose-þrilles is enplanted. Neþeles, it is to knowen þat þis 
bone coronale is founden summe time diuided oþer departed wiþ þe 
|P_20 
commissure in þe middes off þe forbede o-trauers, þe whiche is founden 
as for þe moste partie in wymmen. 
 
þe secounde bone is in þe hynder partie of þe heued, and it is cleped

þe þrid & þe ferþe bene in þe middes, þat is to seien, on þe sides of

after þe lengþe of þe braine panne. and bi þe two commissures 
a-forseid vn-to þe bones of þe eres, and þeie ben square. 
 
þe fifte and þe sexte bene bones þat ben cleped petrosa be cause þat 
þei ben harde, and þei ben cleped also mendosa, for þei ioyne, as it 
were squames oþer scales, wiþ þe bones þat ben cleped parietales, 
aforseid, in þe which þe holes of þe eren ben and addiciouns, liche to

þe vij. bone is cleped paxillare oþer basillare, for it is, as it were a

þat þer ben vij bones of þe braine panne, and so þei be noumberde in dede

Also galien noumberþ hem in þe same maner in þe .20. chapiter of 
þe elleuenþe boke de [\f. 44b\] vtilitate particulari, wher-fore it semeþ wele 
þat Willelmus de Saliceto and lamfrank and henricus de hermondavilla

ben cleped acualia & summe claualia vnder þe bone of þe eres, in þe 
whiche brawnes & cordes ben enplanted oþer sette inne and festend; 
& þei open þe chaftes. And so haly abbas noumberþ in his sermoun of 
þe secounde partie of his firste boke Regalis dispocicionis, in þe chapiter 
of þe assignacioun of þe bones of þe heued. And þerfor he seide 
þat alle þe bones of þe heued ben fiftene in noumber. But auicen, þat 
sette but fyue bones, vnderstode of þo bones þat hadden verreie commissures 
serratiles, þat is to seien, liche a sawe, þe whiche commissures 
ben þre, as he seide, but he demed not þat þer wer oþere two bones in 
eiþer side þat had squamouse oþere scali commissures, but he vnderstode

ende of þe chapiter. And þis sufficeþ of þe anothomie of þe braine 
panne and of þe fiue partikels þerof þe whiche ben contened wiþ-oute-furþe. 
 
þou schalt vnderstonde þat þer is her on a mannes heued for foure 
vtilites oþer profites: þe first is be cause þat þe braine schulde be 
defended þur3 hem fro hete & colde and fro oþere diseses þat fallen fro 
wiþoute-furþe. 
 
þe secounde is be cause þat þe heued schulde be þe feirer be cause of 
þe her, for but 3if þer were her on þe heued. þe heued & þe visage 
schulde ben as þei weren euen liche. 
 
þe þrid vtilite is þat þe colour of þe heres mowe witnessen a-pon þe 
complexioun of þe braine. 
 
þe .iiij. vtilite is þat þe fumes oþer þe fumosites of þe heued mowen 
exalen & passen oute li3tlie, ffor-whie [\f. 45a\] 3if þer were enye þinge engenderde 
off þe nature of her þat were sadde, as is þe skinne, þe fume 
oþer þe smoke my3te not li3tlye passe þur3 it. 
 
þe skinne of þe heued is lacertous & porus and þick, & þat more 
porus þen of enye oþere partie of þe bodie, but be cause þat glorious 
god and nature makeþ no þing in veyne, þerfore y wille schewe þe vtilites 
oþer þe profites of euerie partie of þe heued, and þen of alle þe 
bodie successiuelye. 
 
þe vtilite of þe creacioun of þe skinne of þe heued is for two skilles. 
 
þe firste skille is þat it mowe preserue þe braine fro hete & colde and 
fro oþere diseses þat cummen fro wiþ-oute-furþe. 
 
þe secounde skille is þat it may fele boþe hete & colde a-forne. þe 
whiche þe her doeþ not be cause þat it haþ no felinge. 
 
|P_22 
þe vtilite whi þat þe skinne is more porus þen þe skinne of enye 
oþere partie of a mannes bodie, for-whi seþ þat it is more porus, but 
3iff it were þicker, it schulde not diffend þe braine fro ennoies þat 
cumme fro wiþ-oute-furþe. 
 
þe lacertous fleische of þe heued is anone aftir þe skinne, and þe vtilites 
of þe same brawnes of þe heued & alle þe lacertes of alle þe members 
of a manes bodie is ordeyned for fyue skilles. 
 
þe first skille is be cause þat it mowe diffende þe heued fro diseses 
þat fallen wiþ-oute-furþe. 
 
þe secounde cause is þat he mowe comforten þe digestioun of þe 
members þat ben vndir him be cause of his þicknes. 
 
þe þrid cause is þat alle þe members of a man mowe drawen to hem 
& wiþ-holde and diffye & expellen norissching þur3 mene of hem. 
 
þe ferþe cause is be cause þat it 3eueþ feirer schap to alle þe parties 
of a mannes bodie. 
 
þe vtilites of þe pannikel þat bindeþ þe bones to-gidere is for .ij. skilles. 
 
þe firste skille is be cause þat he schulde conferme oþer festen þe 
febel coniunccioun of þe braine panne þur3 his stronge colligacioun 
oþer bindinge. 
 
þe secounde skille is be cause þat þe lacertes of þe heued, þe whiche 
ben softe, schulde not ben hurte of þe braine panne, þe whiche is harde. 
& þerfore it is sette atwixe hem. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat þe braine panne is made of manye bones is for two 
comune skilles, Of þe whiche þe tone is taken be cause of nede of þo 
þinges þat ben contened vnder þe brayn panne oþer wiþ-inne þe brayne 
panne. A-noþer is taken be cause of nede off þe same braine panne; 
þe whiche conteneþ þre vtilites. 
 
þe firste vtilite is þat 3if þe braine panne were but one bone. [\f. 45b\] 3if þat 
it were hurte in eny partie þeroff, alle þe parties þeroff schulde ben 
disesed, and þat were euyl. 
 
þe secounde vtilite is be cause þat it most ben in one partie harde & 
in a-noþer partie nesche þat what tyme þat þe hard partie is hurte, þe 
nesche partie mowe abide oþer dwellen vnhurt. 
 
þe þrid skille is for þer schulde elles two lesiouns oþer hurtes fallen 
of one stroke, for 3if he were smyten in þe harde partie, he my3te be 
wounded in þe same partie, and þer-wiþ þe softer partie mi3te folde, 
þe whiche were harde. 
 
þe secounde vtilite, þat þer be mo bones þen one, þe whiche is taken 
of þe bones þat ben contened vndir him, is for .ij. skilles. 
 
|P_23 
þe first skille is þat veines þat beren norischinge to þe braines mowe 
enter þur3 þe commissures of him; & þat mi3te not be, and þe braine 
panne were an hole bone. & vndepartabel. 
 
þe secounde vtilite is þat nerues þat ben sensibel & motiue, þat is to 
seien, felinge & meuynge, mowe passen þoru3-oute þe commissures, 
bringinge felinge & meuyng to þe vtter parties of þe heued. 
 
þe þrid vtilite is þat þe fumes þat risen oute of þe brayne mowe exalen 
oþer passen oute þoru3 þe forseide commissures. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat þe commissures of þe heued allonelye weren liche 
a sawe was be cause þat manye þingis moste passen þur3 hem, as 
sinewes, veines, fume oþer smoke; þe whiche mi3t not be, & þei were 
bounden to-gidere wiþ stronge ligamentes. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat it was harde is be cause þat it schulde defende þe 
braines and þe pannikels fro diseses þat fallen oþer cummen fro wiþ-oute, 
& be, as it were, ane helme oþer a schelde for to defende hem. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat it is pleine wiþ-inne & wiþ-oute is be cause þat 
neiþer þe dura mater neiþer þe pannikel þat bindeþ þe bones to-gider 
schulde ben hurte off þe extremites of him. 
 
þe vtilite whie þat he is spongious in þe middis is for þre skilles. 
 
þe first is þat fumosite, be cause of þe porosite þer-off, mi3te passen 
oute þe more frelye and li3tlye. 
 
þe secounde is be cause þat it schulde be þe more li3te þat þe braine 
were not greued þoru3 his ponderosite oþer heuynesse. 
 
þe þridde, þat blode mi3te be kepte in his porosite. þe whiche blode 
is norisschinge to him. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat he is rounde is for two skilles. þe first, for he 
schulde mowe wiþ-holde in him manye þingis.for a rounde figure is of 
more capacite þen enye oþer figure, as it scheweþ bi þe autorite of 
galien in þe ende of þe þrid chapiter, in þe vij. partie de Iuuament[{is{], 
þer as he setteþ þe vtilites of þe roundenes [\f. 46a\] of ffigures. 
 
þe secounde cause, for he schulde preserue þe braine and him selfe 
boþe & wiþ-stande hem þe better fro diseses þat fallen wiþ-oute-furþe. 
 
Also þer ben two vtilites whi þat þe braine panne is euelonge. 
 
þe first skille is be cause þat þe braine is euelonge. 
 
þe secounde cause is þat þe sinewes and þe nucha þat passen oute fro 
þe first and þe þrid ventrikel of þe braine mowe haue space for to passen 
oute atwixe þe braine & þe braine panne þat in her passing oute þei 
schal not immediate mete with þe braine and hurte it. 
 
|P_24 
And forto speke of þe parties wiþ-inne þe braine pane, a man maie 
not schewe hem at þe y3e but 3if þe braine be deuided oþer departed 
wiþ summe sawe after þe roundenes, & þen, when þe ouer partie is 
lifte vppe, þe first þat renneþ-to is dura mater & pia mater, and þei ben 
two pannikels fulle of veines, þe tone o þat partie þat. þe braine 
panne is, and þe toþer on þat partie þat þe braine is. & þei belappe 
& couern alle þe substaunce of þe braine. Pericranen 
groweþ out of þe dura mater þur3 þe commissures. And norischinge is 
3ette in-to þe braine fro þe pia mater, and þer cumme to hem veines & 
arteries þoru3 þe holes of þe lower bones. & fro wiþ-outen also þoru3 þe 
ouer bones. 
 
And þen foloweþ nexte vnder hem þe substaunce of þe braine, and it 
is nesche & white and off rounde figure, spered inne wiþ addiciouns 
þat ben in him. and þe sensitiues and oþere manye principales be borne 
& doubelde fro þe dindimacioun off him, after þe lengþe, þat 3if þat 
one of hem suffer eny þing. þe toþer mowe serue, as galien seiþ in þe 
viij. partie de vtilitate particulari. 
 
þe braine haþ þre ventrikels after þe lengþe, and euerye ventrikel 
oþer wombe haþ two parties, & one vertue is wrou3t oþer begynne in 
euerie partie. ffor comune witte is assigned in þe firste partie of þe 
forþer ventrikel, And in þe secounde ymaginacioun, & in þe middel 
ben sett cogitatiua & racionel and in þe hynder partie ben sette seruatiue 
& memoratiue. 
 
And amonge þes ventrikels þe formest is moste, & þe middel is 
lesse, and þe hyndermest atwixe two. And þer ben weies fro one to a-noþer 
bi þe whiche spirites passen, and þer ben addiciouns, as it were 
pappe tetes, in þe forþemer ventrikel, in þe whiche þe felinge of smellynge 
is founded; and for þe moste partie [{þer{] growen oute of him 
seuen paire of sensitiue sinewes, þe whiche ben produced oþer passen 
furþe to þe y3en & to þe eres & to þe tunge and to þe stomake [\f. 46b\] and to 
oþere members, as it schal be seide afterwarde; and a man maie see 
þe begynnyng and þe holes of hem & where-þoru3 þei passe, & howe 
þei be not bare, but lapped in pannikels. 
 
|P_25 
þou schalte [{see{] aboute þe middel ventrikel a place þat is cleped 
lacuna & vermiformis & anchaformis & glandulous fleische fillinge. 
And rethe mirabile is sette vnder þe pannikels, contexte oþer wouen to-gider 
wiþ arteries alone þat cumme fro þe harte, in þe whiche bi elaboracioun 
oþer trauelinge spiritus animalis is made of spiritus vitalis. 
 
And þen at þe laste þou schalte beholde howe þat þe nucha oþer þe 
marie off þe backe groweþ oute off þe hinder partie of þe braine, & 
nou3t bare, but lapped wiþ two pannikels ri3t as þe braine, descendinge 
þoru3 þe middes of þe spondiles to þe ende off þe backe, of þe whiche 
nucha growen oute principallie motiue sinewes, as it schal be seide 
here-aftir. 
 
þe nucha is liche to þe braine & semeþ as it were party þeroff, and 
þerfore his tokens oþer his accident[{es{], when he is greued, ben ri3t as 
þei were of þe brayne, as galien seiþ in þe xij. boke de vtilitate particulari, 
in þe xij. chapiter fine. And so þe anothomie of þe braine 
panne & off þe parties of him is spedde as for vj. þat ben inquered 
oþer sou3te in him. 
 
þe vtilite of þe strengþe of þe braine panne was ordeined be cause 
þat it couereþ þe braine in þe ouer partie þer-off, þe whiche is sette to 
manye periles & diseses, and þei ben, as it were, a scheld, defendinge 
þe braine. 
 
And þes bones be cleped vernalia be cause of her commissure, þat 
is cleped vernalis, when it is ioyned wiþ þe commissure þat is cleped 
coronalis; þe vtilite whi þat þe bones of þe braine panne ben to-gider, 
so as it were a sawe, & none oþere of alle þe bodie, is be cause þat it is 
nescessaire þat mo þinges passe þoru3 þe commissures of þe heued þen 
bi enye oþere commissures. 
 
þe vtilite of þe addicioun of þe bones þat ben cleped mendosa oþer 
petrosa on þe lower parties off þe bones þat ben cleped vernalia is for 
foure skilles. 
 
þe first is be cause þat þe bones þat ben cleped vernalia ben more 
febel be-neþe þen aboue. 
 
|P_26 
þe secounde cause is for þat partie is more plaine & lesse rounde, and 
þerfore it is lesse mi3tye for to wiþ-stande diseses þat cummen fro wiþ-oute-furþe; 
& þerfore it nedeþ hem. 
 
þe þrid cause is for þer ben holes in þe bones þat ben cleped vernalia, 
þe whiche ben þe holes of þe Eres, þe whiche make þo bones febel. & 
þerfore þe addicioun of þe bones þat ben cleped petrosa were nescessarie 
in þat place. 
 
þe ferþe skille is be cause þat þe substaunce of þe braine is wunder 
nere to þe holes of þe Eres and þo bones vernalia ben þer febel, þer-fore, 
be cause of more alteracioun of Eire, þo bones þat ben cleped 
petrosa ben added-to in þat place þat þe eire þat passeþ þur3 hem to þe 
braine mowe ben degraded in manye maners. 
 
þe vtilite of þe same bones þat ben [\f. 47a\] cleped petrosa bi maner off appodiacioun 
oþer leninge and whi þat þe iunctures of hem be serratil oþere 
liche to a sawe, but superficiel allonelie, for-whi, 3if þei holed þur3 þe 
bones þat ben cleped vernalia, þei schulde raþer make hem more febel 
þen conforten hem. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat þe schap of suche bones was tortuous oþer croked is 
for two skilles. 
 
þe first skille is be cause þat þe eire þat passeþ þoru3 hem to þe braine 
mi3te ben alterate, þat it hurte not þe braine, and þat it mi3te be degraded 
wiþ manye reuoluciouns. 
 
þe secounde cause oþer profite is for þat sownes oþer noises þat ben 
excellent & horribel schulde not passen sodeinlie and euen to þe braine 
and hurte him, for excelent sensibilite corupteþ þe witte, but be cause 
of longe dwellinge in þe forseid reuoluciouns his excellens is made 
lesse. 
 
þe vtilite oþer þe profite whi þat veines descenden vnder þe braine 
panne is be cause þat þe blood of hem þur3 descencioun schulde be 
made sotil. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat þe arteries ascenden is be cause þat þe impetuosite 
off þe blode schulde be refreined in þe passing vppe of arteries / 
 
þe vtilite whi þat þe dura mater is suspended fro þe braine panne is 
for two skiles. 
 
þe firste is for 3if þat þe braine panne touched þe dura mater. it 
schulde greue þe dura mater be cause of his hardenesse. 
 
þe secounde, be cause off quiture þat falleþ fro a wounde wiþ-oute-furþe 
a-twixe þe braine panne & þe dura mater mowe be wiþ-holden on 
þe dura mater þat þe pia mater and þe braine be not greued wiþ quyture. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat þe brayne is colde and moiste is for two skilles. þe 
|P_27 
firste is be cause þat off his coldenes and his moistenes he schulde temper 
& dullen þe excellent hete & drienesse of þe herte. 
 
þe secounde vtilite is be cause þat þe hete þat falleþ or þat is geten 
þur3 meuynge of þe brayne mowe not ouer-chaufen him neiþer 
enflawme hym. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat [\f. 47b\] it is white as a bare tabel is be cause þat 
schulde take oþer resceiuen alle þinge indifferentlye. 
 
þe vtilite why þat is þinne is be cause þat þo þingis þat were taken 
oþer cunned oþer knowen mi3te þe li3tlier passen þur3 
 
þe vtilite whi þe braine is nesche is be cause þat it schulde 3iff stede 
fauour to þe vertue of meuyng oþer to steringe. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat it was mediokerlie oþer menelie viscouse is be 
cause þat þe sinewes schulde be menelie stronge and holdinge, And þat 
þei schulde be lette in her wirchinge be cause off to grete viscosite and 
hardnesse. 
 
þe vtilite whi þat he is distincte in his ventrikels is for þre skilles. 
 
þe first skille is for þat þe spirites schulde dwellen sufficientlie in 
hem for to taken fulle digestioun. 
 
þe secounde skille is for þat euerye vertue mi3te sufficientlie vse his 
acciouns vppon þinges þat weren resceived oþer taken, aforne þat it 
passed fro one ventrikel to a-noþer, and þat mi3te not be done in a 
moment. 
 
Now it is to sene what sekenesse mowe fallen in þes same parties 
writin in þis chapiter. þe potte of þe heued oþer þe brayne panne maie 
suffer woundes, enpostumes, and euyl complexiouns Of the [{whiche{] 
it scheweþ þat woundes þat persen alle þe brayne panne ben 
perillous, and 3it þo woundes þat touchen þe webbes off þe heued ben 
more perilous, and 3itt þo woundes þat touchen þe substaunce of þe 
brayne ben moste perillous. More-ouer, operaciouns þat ben done 
aboute þe commissures of þe brayne ben suspecte be cause off fallynge 
of þe dura mater vppon þe pia mater, and be cause of compressioun of 
þe brayne also. 
 
Alle þe insciciouns off þe heued schal be made after þe goinge of þe 
her, for so gone þe brawnes. Also þei haue þeir owne proper byndingis 
be cause of þe Roundenesse, as it is wele knowen.
