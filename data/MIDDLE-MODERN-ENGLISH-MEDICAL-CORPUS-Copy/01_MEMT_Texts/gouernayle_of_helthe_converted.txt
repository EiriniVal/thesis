[^GOUERNAYLE OF HELTHE^] 
 
[\f. 10\] [}Of bodely exercise 
and of his profite. Capitulum tercium.}] 
Now 3e shal wyte as by auctours 
of lechcrafte that þei þat lyue 
fayre and wele in hosom gouernaunce ow 
for to haue euyn and tempered exercise tofore 
mete for þat 3evyth to al the bodi 
[\f. 10v\] temperd hete and moystour euyn acordyng 
to nature and not passyng which shuld 
a mannys exercise be. Auycen dyscryuyth 
it in a ful fayre maner. Exercise 
is a wilfull meuyng by the 
which a mannys mynde is mouyd 
from slawe into swyfte gretly and 
ofte. And it nedith that þis trauayle be 
wilfull and not stressid by nede, and that 
he may leue of whenne he wole and 
that he be al fre of condicion and wyrk 
aftir his own will and therfor the labour 
of plowmen and carpenteris or of marchauntis 
and soche othir is none exercise 
of her crafte for it hath not propyr 
[\f. 11r\] wilfull meuyng. Marchaundyes, burgeyses 
and cloystereres truli walkyn 
wele and long but 3et it is not properly 
exercise of lechcrafte but whan a man 
walkith frely of his own fre wil and 
so swyftly tyl he begynne to feynt 
and his wynde chaunge than anone 
he shulde sitt down and rest him. For if 
he meuyd any ferther it xulde be 
but payne and fayntyse to him and such 
exercise is clepid temperid exercise for therby 
growyth many godes to a mannys 
bodi. First for ther by is the kyndly 
hete stered and strenghede and so buth the 
iiij virtues that is to say, virtu drawyng, 
[\f. 11v\] virtu defying, virtu withholding and virtu 
outputtyng. And so buth the v 
wittes þat is to sey heryng seyng 
smellyng tastyng and felyng. And so 
be the iij myndly virtues that is to 
sey ymaginatyf discretyf and memoratyf. 
And if a yreny errour happenyd 
in al the workes of lechcraft so it 
wer not to notable and exercise wer done 
as it shulde be don sholde neuer or seldom 
mannys bodi nede othir medicyne for 
exercise fulfilyth al the defautis of lechcrafte 
for thy be thay mery that 
drede blodeles and such othir dowty medicynes 
for by exercise thei may be hele 
[\f. 12r\] and saued. Neuertheles ij thynges 
be nedefull to euery man wele exerciede þat 
is to sey that he be not to full ne to 
empty. To full for thann wolde the 
humours louse and that wer gret drede 
of the lyuer or of sum gret feuer or of 
soden deth for that in such a case þer 
shulde be a long abstinence. Thanne 
loke he be not to empty for thanne 
he shulde be feble out of mesure and at 
the last for febilnesse it most nedes 
lose therfor he þat is to empty it nedith 
þat he labour not til he be more 
truly releuyd. Auctours seyn that 
exercise is on of the hy3est and noblyst 
[\f. 12v\] thyng that may be don to mannys body 
and most nedeful is in gouernayle of 
helth and lenghyng of a mannys lif. 
And whi exercise fulfillyth the medicyne 
of blodelese and such othir and þer in 
is no drede bittirnes ne expens but 
þer in is pur recreacyon of body and 
soule. So it be don in clene places. Than 
shuld a man shew hym self to the clere 
ayer and delite hym self in seyng fer 
and nere watir and londe heuyn and erth grene 
and falow. And in all theis thynges he 
shulde prayse and wurship his lorde God. 
Fulgens discryuyth exercise in a 
full fayre maner saying in this wise. 
[\f. 13r\] Exercise is þe true kepyng of mannys 
lif and the prik of kynd slepyng and þe 
syle of naturall hete and the endyng 
of slawe hete wastyng of superfluytees. 
Saddyng and strenghyng of mannys 
lymes sleyng of al sekenes and dryuyng 
away of vices medicyne of langours 
wynnyng of tyme and dute of youth, 
ioy of elde and help of helth, and enmy of 
idylness distroying of thoughtes and 
of all evyll. But among othir 
thynges it is to witt that exercise mesuryde 
mesurably hetyth a mannys 
bodi and dryeth and therfor flewmatik 
folk shulde vse it and rest colyth a 
[\f. 13v\] man and moystith him and þat is gode for colerik 
men for they be a lonely that withdrawith 
him selfe from exercise that wold 
fayn fayle the ioy and felicite in this present 
lif. Galyen seith that purgaciouns 
and vomytes shulde be take but 
seldom and for gret nede. For whi he þat 
wole ich moneth onys and twyes gretly 
so purge him selfe he xal bryng hys bodi 
in to many euyl vses for he xal 
engendre therin many euyl humours 
wherfor ich day <his> exercise is nedefull and 
ful profitable to the keping of mannys 
helth. For he þat etith and drynkith may 
not be hole but he sumwhat labour or 
[\f. 14\] swynk than by thies thynges that be 
seide before it shewyth wile that mesured 
exercise hath many profitis for it sterith 
the kyndly hete and opynyth the 
poures and lousyth colde and thyk and togh 
humoures and þat be lousyd beryth hem 
out at the poures. It makith a mannys 
ioyntes sliper souple and lythe to mene 
and it confortith al the membris of man 
his bodi wherfore al noyus humours 
of a mannys bodi be more holsomlye 
purgyed bi mesuryd exercise than bi laxatyfes 
or vometys for neythir of hem 
may wele be withoute payrement of þe 
body. And ryght as due kepyng 
[\f. 14v\] of kynde exercise is nedfull, ryght so 
othir while is rest and for as moch as 
rest is contrary to exercise som is bodily 
and som is gostly of the which aythir 
if it be mesuride aftir that kynde 
wole it is helthful both to bodi and 
saule. And if it be not so it is þe contrary. 
For whi if rest be to moch it gendirth 
and norishith and multiplieth many 
evyl humours and encresith moch foule 
corrupcioun in mannys bodi. For whi 
whan watir restith to moch it stynkith 
and so yron and ich othir metall rustyth 
whan it restith to moch. 
 
[}Of þe 
Spices of exercise. Capitulum 4um.}] 
[\f. 15r\] Spices of exercise ther be ful 
many as ther be dyuers states 
of persones for whi sum be strong and sum 
be feble, sum rych and sum poore sum prelatis and 
at large and sum be soiettes and enclosyd and sum 
tyme the wedir is fayre and sum tyme it is 
not so but dew and rayne and therfor it 
nedith to haue dyuers spices of exercise. 
For whi the first and the best is to walk 
be fore mete in hy3 places and clene anothir 
spice is to ride and that is for ich 
men and but gret prelates must haue othir 
maner of exercise. For there in chaumbir 
shal be a gret corde, knottes in the ende 
and tyed on a beme than take that corde 
[\f. 15v\] with bothe thyn handes and stand vpright 
so þu touch not the erth and stond so a 
gode while then ren to and fro as moch 
as þu mayst with þat corde and othir while 
skyp. And if this place the not haue a 
ston in thi chaumbir of a 30ti wey3t 
or ther aboute and if þu wolt a hole 
ther in and ofte bere that ston aboute 
fro the to side of the hous to the todir 
side or els a long while holde it vp 
in thyn armes or thou let it downe 
or bere it aboute thi necke and so of othir 
maners til þu begyn to feynt. Or 
thus: holde a staf in thi hand and late 
anothir take it out of þi hand by 
[\f. 16\] euen draght if he may. Or els thus: 
close a peny in þi hand and let anothir 
take it of his hand if he may. 
Or els thus: hold in thi breth as long 
as þu mayste and than puf it oute al 
a tones and this maner of exercise is 
ful profitable to put out noyus superfluytes. 
For whi in slepe many 
superfluytees ben withholde therfor if 
þu haue no nothir maner of exercise 
holdyng in of thi breth helpith 
moch and is ful profitable. And also to delue 
or to dygge in a gardyne in 
tyme of 3ere or to hold to the plogh 
a forow or too or to walke aftir þe 
[\f. 16v\] plogh to take þe eyre of the erth. Þis 
is ful holsum and profetable for the bodi 
for him þat may haue it. Yit þer be othir 
maner of exercises for yong men that 
ben lusty as to renne to wrastil to 
lepe to cast þe ston and so of othir playes. 
Also tempered companyng 
fleshly with a yong woman is ful helply 
in gouernyng of a mannys helth 
to hem þat may haue it by the lawe 
of God. So natheles þat þis be so moch 
while be twyne þat he fele him selfe 
wele lyghtned in his bodi and that 
he may ete the bettir and slepe the bettir. 
But here vndirstand wele þat 
[\f. 17r\] as moch as helpith tempered companyng 
with a woman and namely to take to 
moch þerof out of mesure for it colith 
a man and wastith him and febelyth him. For 
whi mankynde is mad of the best 
blode and best defyed that most hastlyest 
may turne into mannys lymes 
and whan a man castith out to moch of 
that precius humour he is hugely discolerd 
therwith and his bodi gretly febelyd 
more than if he latte oute 
of his bodi fourty syth so moche 
blode also who þat cumpanyth to moch 
with a woman oft tymes they cach þerof 
a palsye. 
 
[}How a man shuld haue hym 
[\f. 17v\] in etyng his mete. Capitulum 5um.}] 
Whan a man hath wele exercy=c=ed 
him as it is saide afore 
than rest a while aftir and than ete a 
litil white brede wele bake and sumdele 
souryd than drynk a draught of 
gode clere wyne fresh and wel verdured 
or sum othir gode savery fresh 
drynk than rest a while study in 
sum wysemennys wordes than haue sum 
solas and myrth with thi frendis or with 
sum othir honest cumpany than ayens 
yeuen take thi most saule but yf þi 
custum be there ayens. But a generall 
rule of al leches is þat thyn houre 
[\f. 18r\] of etyng be when the hungyrth whedir 
it be by nyght or by day so that 
thi hungyr be very and kyndly and therfor 
ete not but if it be a morsel to 
provoke thin appetite therwith and whan 
þu felist that þu hast a gode appetite 
let not but take it to ete. For as 
Avycenn seyth the stomac out of 
vse to suffre hungre fulfillith the body 
of rotyn humours and than waxith 
a mannys bodi ful of noght bicause 
that coler is drawn to the mouthe 
of þe stomak so that aftirwarde 
whan that he wold ete and hath non 
appetite than he may not. Fer 
[\f. 18v\] thermore it is to witt that no man 
shulde ete til he knew that his stomak 
wer voyde of that he had etyn 
beforn and þat xal a man know by 
the desyre þat he hath to ete and by 
plenty of spyttyng that he hath commyng 
up to his mouth. For why 
who þat etith withoute desire or appetite, 
his mete shal fynde the kyndly hete 
of his stomak cold and if he ete 
with desire he xal fynde the kyndly 
hete of his stomak yeue up a smell 
like to encens. But thise and such 
othir xal be vndirstonde of hem þat 
haue mete ordeyned at ther owne 
[\f. 19r\] will and he that so hath not ete 
whan that he may haue it for thei 
ar not bounde to the lawes of this 
crafte. As to the qualitees of thy 
metis vndirstond wele that tho metes 
which most gouernyth thyn helth sholde 
be passing in eny qualite for tho metes 
that be to hotte brennyth thi blode as 
pepir crasses garlek onyons sauge 
myntes persele and soch othir and thoo 
that be to colde fresyn thi blode 
and sleth it as letuce purslane gourdis 
and such othir and þi metes be to watery 
than thei rotyn þi blode as 
melons cucumbers and if þi metes ben 
[\f. 19v\] to drye it throwith oute þi vertues and 
if þi mete be to fat thei lettyn þi degestyon 
and if thei be to swete thei stoppen 
the and make the costyse and if þei 
be to bittir truly thei norich the not 
and if thei be salt they brenne noye 
and breke thi stomak and if thei be to 
soure thei make þe sone olde. Therfor 
non of theis metis aforseid moch and 
contynually vsid ar not gode to the helthe 
of mannys bodi but only that mete 
is gode that is tempered and wantyth the 
mocheness. Than be theis gode metes and 
holsum: lamb of o yere yong kiddes 
soukyng calves hennes capons checons 
[\f. 20r\] pertriches fesanntes ploueres smale birdes 
of the feldis and of the wodes but 
none of the watir yong soukyng 
pygges rabettes in tyme of 3ere whan 
thei be in seson and othirwhile pygges 
fete and hogges fete and othir extremitees 
as groynes and erys also scalid fissh 
of clene rennyng watir and rere egges 
also borage and langdebef and violettes ar 
gode and holsum to make wortes of and 
also whete brede wele bake and sumdel 
soured o day olde or tweyn at most 
and so of al othir that be not to moch 
passyng in any qualite and if we 
drede exces of any qualite amend it by 
[\f. 20v\] the contrary therof. Ensaumple: if 
þu be seke of gluy and towgh metes vse 
therfor sharpe metes and short as 
peris and chese and soule salt metes soure 
and byttir may be amendid with swete appels 
hony or with swete wyne and so of al 
othir. And if þu wilt ete frutis ete hem 
first as cheris damysenys and grapes and 
soche othir and aftir mete a few peris 
notes and lake qunyces. Also the complexion 
of man wolde be loked to and if 
it be tempered than kepe it so with lyke 
metis and drynkes and if it be distempered by 
his contrary by litel and litel bryng it in 
ayene into gode temperure and forthi 
[\f. 21\] to sanguine men distempered yeue to them 
malencolius metes and to 
malencolius men distempered sangrine metis 
and to fleumatik men distempered coleric 
metes for euery euyl complexion 
may be brought into temperure but 
if necessaryes of lyflode lett it. And 
here note þu wele tha=t= whosoeuer ete 
mylke and fyssh togeder at o mele, oftyn 
tyme cattch therof a white skab 
or a lepure also who that vsith ofte 
mylk and wyne togeder, ofte tyme 
bryngith a man into hatre. And 
here suffisith now of qualitees of metes.
