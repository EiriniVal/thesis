Of euery and to euery eare oon of hem

Fforsoth ther is a visible qualite hoote and drie. Hoote

[}quod qualitas tactabilis toti corpori praestetur}] 
Of treatabil vertu to al the [\f. 41v\] body it 
yieldith but most to the handis, more forsoth of 
thiese inner parties in so moche that to euery nerf of

On furthermore to the palate suspended, as

thynges, whiche lower and innermore part of the lunges 
affixeth, and dividith in 2 canals, wherof that oon bi 
the right penne fether or wyng of the lunges, that other 
bi the lift is departed. Of whom the right side to the 
right eare of the herte. The lift forsoth, to the lift 
vponset drawith, to whiche, takyng cold and moist aire, 
sumwhat seethith and so soden to the earis and hert 
mynistren, ther a litel the spirite withold eftsones

[}qualitas cordis}] 
The herte forsoth in high cours is and in the 
end sharp ... Of whos former part procedith arteries 
whiche bien joyned to the lyver, bi that he drawith to 
hym norisshyng bloode, and from withoutfurth another 
procedith forwhi 2 canals divided. Bi oo norisshyng 
bloode and the spirite to the brayne leuyth, bi another 
forsoth, in many subdivided canels, the natural heete 
toguyder with bloode bi al tyme mynistrith the herte 
|P_70 
and naturaly inshedith. Þe purs whiche couereth that 
herte owith of 2 membriculis or smale membris, on

whiche is withoutfurth that myghten noye to the herte, 
and suppe vp cold and moist aire whiche to the herte to

whos nature berith the symilitude epizotis litel membranes; 
sum dividen spiritual membres, that is to say, the lunges 
and the herte in the vpper cellis abidyng, to the 
norryshyng membris in the lower parties degestyng, of 
whos nature evene folowyng I shal treate. 
 
[}de oesophago}] 
Ysophagus bi whom mete and drynk is attribute cold 
and drie, and of that partie whiche rewmatic canals 
|P_71 
vnderputtith þe side of other forsoth whiche 
convicten the thynne and the weike musculis, he fyndith 
in the symylitude of a thorny chambre vnderlifted whiche 
 vnto epizotos membrely be brought, whiche percith to the 
mowth bi clippith to the stomac whiche thoo epizotis is 
suspensed. 
 
[}de qualitate stomachi}] 
The stomac that whan he owith of thynne nervis 
and of long lunaries, ouert whert, whiche of

lunaries, highly woven webly or netly, ... swiftly

withynfurth the litel membranes bien couered, with 3 
maner knyttynges beyng made, that is to say, short, meane, 
and long to whom the meate and drynk natural is turned 
into juce of mylke, as a ship to suche a port impugnyth 
the stomac. That, therfor it is saide a yaate, whiche 
the male settith into þe mynisterie natural, vnto the

forsoth, therof, is saide whiche to oon openeth with an 
hoole to whom it is set, that is to say, or myainc, 
the vertu to hym what that he takith of the longaon without 
any contrasionsite, he may yielde. Forwhi therfor, it 
is maniac manic or sleeve whiche is more lengger of al 
other. Forsoth the subtil part, bi the miserac veynes of 
|P_75 
fastyng withdrawith, whiche in frowardly sette 
vndirdrawen to hym the juce or moisture seethen, and 
soden to the lyver bien mynistred. Wher the same makyng 
taryeng, to the litel soule of natural vertu is 
torned into bloode, whiche in 2 divide parties. Of thiese 
whiche thynner and weiker is and vertu is saide, the 
chest[\?\] of the lyver grauntith, þat bi 2 greene 
canals to the reynes departith, so ther abidyng, seethiþ, 
of whiche ther the reynes whiche is more profitable to 
norisshyng thei observen. The remenaunt forsoth, bi the 
|P_76 
same poores to the bladder dividith, whiche whan thei 
come to the neck of the bladder, evenly be joyned. 
Fforsoth, the nek of the bladder dividith to suche a 
cloth to whom the greene poores of that on partie, 
and of that other of the vpper membrannes subtily woven, 
evene glueth wherof, and he seeth what of the raynes 
flowith to the bottum or ground of the bladdir 
destyneth bi anoþer [{innermore{]. Fforsoth that is 
to say, to whom the yerd such tyeng evene joyneth 
after nature, and without nature, that bladder the vryne 
ther beyng sendith out. Another part forsoth adicial or 
addyng to is saide, rede coler of the galle malencoly of 
the milt or spleen yieldith. Forsoth of bloode whiche is 
|P_77 
most profitable and pure the liver to the norisshyng 
roote observith, of the whiche what is to the herte, and 
that herte as it is above saide, mynistreth to the brayn. 
The remenaunt forsoth to the dyuers parties of the bodie by 
suche veynes to euery propirte destynat to the eekyng or 
lengger lastyng, whiche bien wele soden to the symilitude 
of his nature, and to the prope to be chaunged that is 
nutrible to hym the reteigne. Vnprofitable forsoth, whan 
thei bien strang withynfurþ bi thiese 10 thei bien 
expelled: bi heris, bi nailes, bi earis formed bi gummes, 
bi tearis, bi techynges, bi spittyng, bi egestiouns, bi 
nosethirls, bi sweting, bi sharp soupyng. 
 
[}de sensibus animalibus}] 
Bi beastes, that is to say, sciences, a body vsed to 
lustis 9 thynges, to the brayne to hym enlarged, that is 
|P_78 
to say, dilectacioun, haate, joy, sorowe, hardynes, dreede,

smellyng, feelyng, heryng, tastyng, lovith, or haatith, 
joyeth or sorowith, dar or dredith, shameth, wrathith 
or woodith. Fforsoth, whan any man, bi any of thiese 5, 
to the love of any other be areised, it smytith the hert. 
Of whiche smytyng, proceden spirites hoote and drye, 
wherof oon is thynner and weiker whiche drawith the 
brayne. Another forsoth, whiche is thikker sodainly 
forsoth bi nerves shedde leedith to the yerd, whiche 
amonge nervis to whom he is ordayned and made, and the

[}de comune sapore coitus}] 
Of comune savour therfor of suche maner men in al

[}de aetate planetarum in embryo}] 
There and ther 7 planetis sumwhat in composicioun

But forwhi as yit membres whiche in so moche bien parfite,
