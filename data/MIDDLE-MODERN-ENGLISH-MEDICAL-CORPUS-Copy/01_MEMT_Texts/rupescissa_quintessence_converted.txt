[\f. 1r\] [}The furst boke of the consideracion of quynte essence of alle thinges 
that mowe bee changid fro oone kynde to an other.}] 
In the name of oure Lord Ihesus Crist, here begynneth the boke of the 
lyknesse and simulacion of philosophie witnessing the euaungel of oure Lord 
Ihesus Crist, the whiche he hath yeue and grantid to holy lyuers. 
 
The furst decre is þat by the vertue the whiche God hath yeue to nature 
made and to mannys knowlaiche, a man may sodaynely al inprofitablenesse and 
fleublenesse of olde age in the ouer olde men been lettid fro holy werkes cure and 
restore ayen. And youthe and strengthe with lustynesse of juuentute may be had 
ayen and restorid newe but not in the same degre but rather better, the whiche is 
the gretteste pryuete that is in al kynde. 
 
|P_102 
And how hit shal be made or doo. 
 
[}Here is the furste canon.}] 
This is the thing in the whiche alle men haue labourid to siche, a thing y-made 
the whiche is profitable to the vse of man, the whiche may kepe his 
corruptible body fro corrupcion and putrefaction and to conserue hit fro wastyng. 
And yf hit be possible, to kepe a man euerlastyng in life and helthe, ffor that is a 
thing that alle men desiren, neuer to deye. 
 
Witnessyng the holy philosophre Saint Paule in the Secunde Epistil Ad 
Corinthios, the v chapitre, Nam et qui sumus in hoc tabernaculo corporis 
ingemiscimus grauati, eo ex infirmitatibus eo quod nolumus exspoliari sed corpore 
vestiri ipso corpore ne moriamur ideo subdit ut sorbeatur, quod mortale est, a 
uita. Hec Paulus. 
 
Ful fewe philosophres haue come to the laste cause of knowlache of suche 
thinges, euidence and cause why men and leches now-a-dayes been sette so ferre in 
couetise and in desiring of worldly worship þat thay mowe not, ne God wille not, 
þat thay haue suche grace to come to suche high cunnyng. 
 
|P_103 
But as oure trewe philosophre Paule seyth in Epistil ad Hebreos, þe ix 
chapitre: "At last euery man is ordeyned [\f. 1v\] oones to deye." Ergo, hit were a 
phantasie to laboure in this deedly life to siche suche a thing the whiche mighte 
kepe oure deedly body immortal and neuer to deye. For God seyth in Genesi in 
the thridde chapiter: "Now therefore, lest Adam put fourth his hande and take of 
the tree of life and ete to lyue for euer, therefore oure Lord put hym oute of lusty 
paradise to wirke on th'erthe of the whiche he was made. And so he sette hym 
bifore paradise and ordeyned Cherubyn with a brennyng swerde to kepe the weye 
of the tree of lyfe." Ergo, hit were but a fantasie to seye þat God yafe to Adam 
withoute paradise any thing by the whiche he mighte lyfe for euer, sith oure Lord 
caste hym oute þat he shuld not touche the tree of life leste he shulde lyue for euer. 
 
This we seen openly in holy writte, þat God hath sette and ordeyned to 
euery man a terme of life, the whiche noo man may passe by noo crafte ne witte. 
As Job seieth: Breues dies hominis sunt, et numerus mensium eius apud te est; 
constituisti terminos eius, qui preteriri non poterunt. Ergo, to siche helpe and 
remedie ouer the tyme that God hath ordeyned to man hit were but vayne. 
 
Therefore, hit is to siche remedie to conserue and kepe oure bodies fro 
corrupcion for þe tyme and þe terme þe whiche God hath sette to man to lyue yn, 
|P_104 
and to make hym hole and hym merueusely to cumforte and restore to the last day 
of deeth come the whiche oure Lord hath assigned to vs. To saue a man fro al 
deeth byfore þe day of God assigned is not in oure powere, as deeth of thundre or 
lightenyng, of falles of slaughtre, or of any violence, but to reherche of þe deeth 
bifore þe terme alimyted of surfetes and of corrupcion of þe body and of defaute of 
vertue in kynde, as ofte hit falleth. 
 
Reason sheweth þat the corruptible body desireth to be nourisshed by 
corruptible thingz and roten, and so refourme þe body by a inparfite thing. And 
so the body is made corruptible by [\f. 2r\] thingz that been corrupte and faylyng, 
and the sike to hele by matiers that been vnstedefaste and foule. To make fayre by 
stynkyng crafte, alle suche been but fantasies and vayne matiers. 
 
Ergo, the rote of life is to siche a thyng of hymsilf that myght abide 
euermore incorrupte, the whiche may kepe al thing that is y-put there-ynne fro 
corrupcion, as flessh in his kinde, vertue, and state, the whiche nourissheth þe 
vertue of life and increcheth and restoreth kynde; and al rawe humour desireth & 
bryngeth hit to euene qualitees. And al qualite that hath excesse or any manier 
qualite that is loste, hit restoreth. And hit maketh kynde moystnesse to be 
plenteuous and hit maketh hete of kynde myghty. 
 
And trowe wel withouten any falsehede þat noone of the iiij elementz is of 
|P_105 
suche kynde, ne noo thing that is componyd of any matieres of þe iiij elementz, for 
alle suche been cause of corrupcion. And alle corruptible and sike and fleuble, yf 
corrupte matiere or like to corrupcion be putte ther-to, hit encrechith hit. And for alle 
leches, by suche corrupte matieres whiche been componyd of elementz and of 
matieres there-of and wrought there-with, myght neuer come to þe high pryuete that 
we siche. 
 
But sum seyen þat al that is bodily in this worlde to þe vse of man bee 
elementz or of elementz. Ergo þe rote of life may not in this worlde be founde of 
man, þe whiche may quyke þe body vnto þe last terme of life y-merked to man of 
oure Lord God. 
 
[}Indago celi nostri seu quinte essencie. 
The prologe of oure heuene or quynte essence.}] 
To answere treuly to þis matiere, hit behoueth to siche a thing þe whiche 
|P_106 
is in comparasoun and in respecte of þe iiij qualitees of þe whiche oure body is 
made, as heuene is in comparasoun of þe iiij elementz. Philosophres clepen 
heuene quynte essence in comparason of iiij elementz. For heuene in hymsilf is 
incorruptible and also inchangeable, receuyng [\f. 2v\] noon other impressions ne 
kinde but as God hath commandid. So the thing is whiche we sechen. In 
comparason of þe iiij qualitees of oure body, quynte essence is in hymsilf 
incorruptible. Yf hit shuld stonde for euer, not hote with fyre and drye, neyther 
colde ne moyste with watre, nether hote ne moyste with eyre, nether colde ne 
drye with erthe, but hit is quynte essence auaylyng ayens alle contrarieuseness. 
For right as heuene is incorruptible and as whenne nede is, hit reyneth moisture 
and sumtyme hit yeueth hete, sumtyme colde, sumtyme drouthe, suche is þe rote 
of life, quynte essence, the whiche oure Lord Almighty made in kinde to fulfille þe 
nedes of oure body vnto þe tyme of oure Lord assigned. 
 
And I seye þat oure Lord Almighti made quynte essence and wrought hit 
of a kindeli body and made hit craftily with man is reason and witte. 
 
And I shal name hit with hys iij names, þe whiche was youen of olde 
|P_107 
philosophres sumtyme. Furste ye shal calle hit brennyng watre, the soule of 
wyne or the spirite of wyne, and aqua vite, watre of life. And whenne þou wilte 
hide his name fro lewde men þat thay shal haue noon vndrestanding, calle hym 
quinta essencia or quynte essence. For his kinde and his name, quynte essence, 
was shewed by olde philosophres; and with thaym thay kepten this cunnyng close. 
 
And þat hit is not colde and moyste as th'element of watre is, I shal shewe 
by reason, for hit is brennyng and so is not th'element of watre. And þat hit is not 
hote and moiste as th'ayre is, hit proueth wel; for th'ayer wol rather ingendre 
corrupcion and venum as hit sheweth wel in mystes and contagious ayers, þe 
generacion of flyes and spithers and attrecobbes and oþer corrupcions. But oure 
quynte essence is euer biding incorruptible, yf hit bee kindely closid fro th'ayer. 
And þat hit is not colde and drye as th'erthe hit sheweth expressely, for hit is 
highest in wirking of kinde in hete. And that [\f. 3r\] hit is not hote and drie as the 
fire is, hit sheweth in wirking, for hit maketh hote thingz colde and hote sikenes 
hit lesseth and putteth of, as I shal proue here after. 
 
And þat hit taketh awaye corrupcion and kepeth a thing fro corrupcio experience 
proueth hit thus. For take what maniere byrde or pece of flessh or fissh 
|P_108 
that þou wil and put hit there-yn, and hit shal neuer apeyre while hit is there-yn. 
Thenne, by reason, hit shulde wirke more in quycke flessh and lyuely creatures 
and kepe hit fro alle corrupcion. This is quynte essence, man is heuene, þe 
whiche oure Lord made yn keping of alle thingz. 
 
And knowe hit for sothe þat philosophres now-a-dayes and leches knowen 
not þis quynte essence nother his kinde. Therefor, with þe grace of God I shal 
shewe hereafter the pryuytes of hym. 
 
Here I haue shewed the a secrete thing, quynte essence, i. man is heuene, 
in comparison as heuene euer lasting. 
 
[}Indago solis ad influendum principium vite in nobis et ad ornandum celum 
nostrum summum. 
The prologe of the sunne, that is to seye, gold, to brynge in þe bigynnyng 
of lyfe in vs and to araye oure heuene at fulle; that is callid quynte essence.}] 
Hit helpeth not oonely man is body by hymsilf but oonely by vertue of þe 
sunne and other sterres. Thys heuene, quynte essence, wil highte and florisshe þe 
sunne merueusely and make hym shyneng withoute corrupcion; but euen as quynte 
essence, this sunne may not wirke in distrueng of hete. And þerfore I seye to þe of 
|P_109 
veray charite and good conscience, þat this sunne is y-lightnyd and shynyng and 
vnable to be with fyre y-wastid, for hit is incorruptible and bringeth ynne þe rote 
of life. As possible may be as I haue shewed bifore in man is body, the whiche is 
made to glorifie oure heuene and to increche the influence of quynte essence þat 
same be take with man is hande. And God hath ordeyned hit in the power of 
deedly creatures. And I at instance [\f. 3v\] of God and for charite seye to you 
holy lyuers and good men what is this sunne that shal stande in oure heuene, 
quynte essence. I shal shewe hym to you by his propre name. 
 
Hit is gold whiche is take of the vraye myne or of the oure in th'erthe, and 
not gold whiche is made of waters and is gadred and wrought by crafte. For gold 
of the doctor alkym was made of corrosie waters, the whiche is contagious to man 
is nature. But this good gold of the myne is clepid among philosophres the sune, 
for hit is þe soon of sunne of heuene. For this gold is ingendred in th'erthe of the 
reflections of the sunne. And to hym þe sunne yeueth his kinde and colour, and 
his substance kepith fro corrupcion as comparison may be made. 
 
But quynte essence is of the nature and colour of heuene and oure sunne 
|P_110 
shal hight hym as þe sunne highteth heuene. And thees two ioigned togedres, þat 
is to seye, quynte essence and gold, haue the condicions of heuenely heuene that is 
abouue and of heuenely sunne as possible may be in nature, of creatures that been 
deedly to restore life and nature loste and to renue youthe clerely. And hit yeueth 
kindely helthe as man desireth to haue. 
 
[}Indago stellarum nostrarum ad ornatum celi nostri ad iuuandum 
influenciam nostri celi et solis ad influendum primum principium vite in nobis. 
The prologe of oure sterres to the beaute of oure heuene.}] 
Salamon seieth Eccliasticis in the furst chapitre, "Alle thingz been harde 
and mowen not vtterly bee shewed with man is worde ne tunge." For among alle 
wondre thingz that euer God made in this worlde and moste to be wondrid of is 
this, þat sum spices medicinable haue vertue and powere to drave corrupte 
humours and superfluelt fro oon certayn membre and not of an other, as ierapigra 
that draueth humours fro þe heed, fro þe necke, fro þe breste, and not fro þe navil, 
noþer bynethe. And summe [\f. 4r\] other drauen fro the navil and so bynethe and 
not fro þe ouer parties of membres. But how and where of þat is, hit is ful harde 
to man to knowe. 
 
|P_111 
But the high philosophre Eheben and John Mesue, oþerwise callid 
John of Damaske, in his Boke of Simple Medicines, aboute the bigynnyng, seyeth 
þat there nys noon cause to be askid but þat thay haue that of þe kinde of heuene 
aboue. And how and of what place and partie of heuene thay couthe not seye. 
And yit thay were so good clerkes þat alle leches and philosophres in thees dayes 
callen thaym euangelistz and thay that vndrestonde þe trouthe of suche worldly 
þingz that been of so merueillous vertue. Þe cause þere-of is of God. 
 
But thees worldly philosophres and but communly lettred leches haue noo 
felyng here-on and holden hit but fantasies and lesingz. But to euery fals 
sclaundre, trouthe is to be put afore. I shal siche þe nature of oure sterres to araye 
oure heuene, þat the flouyng of quynte essence that we haue sought and of þe 
sunne, þat is to seye, of the gold of myne bifore seyde in þe prologes, how mouche 
|P_112 
þe kinde of þe heuene and þe sunne been increched by putting to of other sterres. 
 
And knowe ye welle þat euery sterre of heuene aboue hath his flovyng 
dovne to erthe and euery sterre hath his ovne proprete. And euery sterre hath a 
singulier kinde of þe commandement and þ'ordynance of God in wirkyng vppon 
certayne þinges in erthe: As þe loode sterre hath vppon þe adamant stone and 
vppon ire; and þe mone hath his wirking vppon þe water of þe see; the sunne 
vppon gold; þe mone vppon siluer; and images of men aboue in heuene wirken on 
mannes bodies bynethe. And images of shepe or wethres of heuene aboue 
gevyn kinde to shepe and wethers bynethe in erthe. For as a carpintier with his 
axe [\f. 4v\] in his hande maketh a shippe and in lesse þanne he haue his axe he can 
not make hit right, so neither God gouerneth not þe worlde þe whiche hath yeuen 
wirking to þe sterres but oonely lete þe sterres wirke in thayre kinde in þingz here 
bynethe as He wil and hath commandid and noon otherwise. And vndrestande in 
thy hert þat among sterres and images of heuene, of that oone partie and erthely 
things vppon þe whiche þaire kinde failleth, hit is so strong and mighty þat thay 
|P_113 
willen haue thaire kinde courshe of wirking; hit may not be withstande. For 
Aristotilt seyeth þat heuene shuld rathir to breste þan kinde shuld faille here 
bynethe fro wirking of þe sterres aboue. For there is suche knyttyng of kinde and 
loue among þe heuenely bodies þat al þing here bynethe answerith in kinde to 
thaire gouuernance. Considere and se how þat shipmen in þe see setten a nedil 
to þe adamant stone and maketh hym to tourne euen ayenst þe loode sterre. How 
hath þe nedil, þat kinde, to tourne ayenst that sterre so alle waye and withoute 
any defaute and tourneth to noon other place? For sothe and withoute any doute, 
þis is þe cause. For bothe ire and adamant stone by commandement and 
imperialite of God been causid and ingendrid in þ'erthe of that lode sterre and thay 
haue the kinde and the proprete in thaymsilf of þe same sterre. And þerefore for 
þe likenesse þat þe nedil and þe adamant stone han of hym and kinde, þerefore 
euery þing desireth his kinde, and so þe nedil tourneth to hym as for likenesse of 
reason and kinde. 
 
I besiche you what is þe cause: þat as ofte tyme as the mone riseth, þe see 
bigynneth to flowe and arise and whenne þe mone is come þe myddis of 
|P_114 
firmament, hit begynneth to ebbe; and whenne þe mone is in þe west, hit 
begynneth to flowe ayen til þe mone come to þe angle of þ'erthe; and þenne hit 
begynneth to ebbe ayen and so til þe mone arise ayen. And [\f. 5r\] after this 
courshe of þe mone twyes in a day natural is floweng and ebbing. 
 
But neþelees þis foloweth noo course of þe sunne. 
 
But why is hit þat floweng and ebbing of the see foloweth þe mone and not 
þe sunne? The cause is this. For þe mone hauth his kindely influence vppon 
watre, and þerefore floweng and ebbing folowen þe mone and not þe sunne. For 
as a man invisiblyche foloweth kindely a wyman in his thought þe whiche he 
loueth, and a hungry man desireth mete and foloweth hit, and the thursty man to 
drinke, so to þe purpose folowyng I seye þat sterres þe whiche han kindely wirking 
and influence vppon þe heed and þe necke and þe breste of man, as þees sterres: þe 
wethre, þe bole, and gemynes, þe whiche yeueth kinde vppon ierapigra. And 
|P_115 
þerefore by þe commandement of God, ierapigra draveth corrupte humours fro þe 
heed, þe necke, and þe brest, and of noo membre bynethe þaym. And so I seye of 
other spices þat drauen humours fro the knees, þe legges, and þe feet, the whiche 
haue a singuliere reflection and kinde of þe sterres Capricorne and Aquari and 
Piscis; and so hit may be seyed of many other. 
 
Ergo, yf þou wil cure þe heed of any sike man with quynte essence and 
gold, þou must take suche þingz and put þere-yn as been ingendrid of þe kinde and 
constillacion vndre þe sterre of Aries, as ierapigra and oþer suche þat longen to þe 
heed; and so of oþer lymes in þe same wise. 
 
And so with oure sunne and erthely sterres þou shal [{make{] goodely 
cures and miracles here in erth, as I shal teche the in this boke here aftre. 
 
[}Here is the secunde canon of the furst boke, the whiche sheweth the 
maistrie of quynte essence: how and in what wise oure quynte essence with þe 
sunne and þe sterres shal bee arayed and how hit kepeth þe helthe and life of man 
and how quynte essence is made. 
|P_116 
Here bigynneth the furst prologe.}] 
[\f. 5v\] Trowe þou not þat I lye or coloure fals matieres, for hit is quynte essence, 
þe whiche is callid aqua ardent, brennyng watre. And I seide bifore þat noo 
philosophres ne leches nowe-a-day couthe not come þere-to, but of aqua ardent 
euery man may finde ouer al. But for sothe, the maistrie of quynte essence is 
hidde fro thaym. And I saw neuer but oon dyvine that vndirstode any thing of the 
priuetees and maistries of this quynte essence. And I telle you for sothe þat quynte 
essence is brennyng watre and hit is not brennyng. But God in-putteth wisedame 
in the hertz of holy lyuers and good men for whom I make and translate þis boke, 
þat thay comune not hit with reprouous men and mysse lyuers in sclaundre of the 
high priuetees of God. So I shal here openne to the the vraye trouthe. 
 
Thou shal take wyne not ouer clere ne watrie, neyþer blac wyne, erthely 
and thicke, but noble wyne and glad sauery and swete smylling, þe best that may 
be had, and distille hit by a canon ofte tymes til þou haue made good brennyng 
watre atte highest degre þat þou can make and distille hit iij or vij sithes. And 
þis is brennyng watre, þe whiche leches now-a-days knowe and can make wel 
ynow. This is a watery mattere of þe whiche quynte essence is made and drauen 
|P_117 
oute of hit, the whiche we propose on in þis boke. 
 
And whenne þou has þi noble aqua ardent, þenne þou shal doo make a 
vaisshel of glas or a stillatorie al hoole of oon pece, with oon hole aboue yn þe 
heed by þe whiche þe watre shal be put yn and draue oute. And þis vaisshel shal 
haue canons withyn honging dunneward so þat þe watre withyn the vaisshel, by 
vertue of fire, shal ascende and distille withyn þe vaisshel by þe canons streitthing 
oute as armes doon in a body, but þay bee ynwarde in þe stillatorie and many. 
And so distille dovne and arise ayen and þenne dovne ayen contynually day and 
nyght til þat brennyng watre by þe high wille of God be tournyd heuenely into 
quynte [\f. 6r\] essence þe whiche ye siche fore. 
 
And ye shal vndrestande þat the beste watre ardent þat may be made hath 
in hymsilf a material commixtion of þe iiij elementz. And þerefore, by the 
spiracion of God and by þe stillatorie bifore seyde and by continual ascending and 
descending, quynte essence, þe whiche ye siche, shal be departid fro corrupciun 
and composicoun of þe iiij elementz. And so by greet labour and contynual 
|P_118 
distilling withyn þe vaisshel, and by ascending and descending and sublymyng, hit 
shal come to so high glorieusenesse þat hit is made almoste incorruptible as heuene 
and of þe kinde of heuene. And þerefore hit is callid quynte essence, for he is of 
suche kinde in respecte of oure body as heuene is aboue in respecte of al þe world, 
almoste in þe same wise as crafte may folowe kinde by suche a maniere similitude 
as nygh as nature may conclude. 
 
Here ye shal knowe whenne quynte essence is ful made and departid fro þe 
iiij elementz, and how in hymsilf he is neyther hote ne moyst, nether colde ne 
drye as þe iiij elementz been. But hit is as heuene, with his sterres and his beaute 
made þe space of many dayes in þe vaisshel of circulacion bifore descrybed by 
contynuel ascencion and descencion by ciercle distillacion. 
 
Thenne, to knowe whenne he is parfit, þou shal openne þe hoole of þe 
vaisshel þe whiche is in þe heed faste closid cum luto sapiencie, with 
philosophres lute, made of smal flour and of moyst papire smal teesid and with 
white of egges mellid and tempered togedre, þat noo breeth passe ynne ne oute. 
And when þou has openned þe hoole, yf þou fele a meruaillous sauour so 
wondreful þat noo worldly swettnesse ne sauour with smelling may be lykenyd to 
hym, but hit shal seme to þy vndrestanding þat ayer and swetnesse shal be þere-ynne 
|P_119 
as hit were of þe high gloyre and ioye of God. And þis may be callid [\f. 6v\] 
a greet mervail, þat a vaisshel be put in a cornier of þe hous with any licour y-closid 
withynne hym al oon þat hit may suche swete smylling and tourne into 
quynte essence; hit may bee callid a vray miracle, for hit draueth alle þees 
swetnesse to hym invisibly. And whenne þou felis alle þees swetnesse and 
mervaillous odour, þenne has þou quynte essence, þe whiche we calle oure heuene, 
as þou has herde bifore, to þe whiche noo philosophres ne leches in oure tyme 
myghten come to, excepte hym as I seide of afore. 
 
And yf þou feele noo suche sauour ne smylling to a man is taste, as I seide, 
close the vaisshel ayen and sette hit to þe fire as I shal shewe here after, þat by 
sublimacions and ciercle ascencions and descencions hit may be ful wrought and 
brought to fulle perfection of glorieuse quynte essence. This glorieuse matiere and 
spirituelle shal not haue þat heete in thy mouthe as watre ardent hath, neþer noon 
suche qualitees of colde, moyst, ne drye as the iiij elementz haue. For þe sherpe 
heete of watre ardent and his aquosite by ciercle sublimacions been wastid awaie. 
And th'er[{þ{]ely matiere and pondereuse shal leue in þe bottume or þe fundement 
of þe vaisshel. 
 
And so oure heuene and þe sterres, þat is to seye oure quynte essence, is 
|P_120 
complete and made of a body and of a soule, but not in þat wise as a body is made 
of þe iiij elementz. For hit wil be but litel, glorious, and subtile, and of so noble 
fourme þat þe power of þat matiere shal not be transfourmyd into noon oþere kinde 
and so remayne incorrupte til God dissolue and breke þe powere þere-of. But 
quynte essence, þe whiche we speken of, is, as who seyeth, incorruptible as heuene 
is, as crafte may folowe kinde. And so in respecte of any matiere y-made of þe iiij 
elementz, hit is verraily incorruptible. But and hit were vtterly incorruptible as 
heuene is, hit wolde renne thorough man is [\f. 7r\] body as witnesshet oure Lord 
Ihesus Crist, maker of al thing. 
 
Now I haue y-oppenned a parte of this secrete matiere to worship and joye 
of oure Lord Ihesus Crist. 
 
Here is cunnyng and witte to haue fire withoute fire and to make quynte 
essence withoute labour and expense and withoute occupacion and losing of tyme. 
And here we thinke in this boke to cumforte pouer men and hooly lyuers þat thay 
bee not y-lette fro þaire prayers by wirking of this precieuse watre. I shal shewe to 
you a wondre þing and a meruaillous ffire withoute fire and withoute wode or 
cole. And þere-ynne is oure quynte essence y-made and gendrid withoute expense. 
 
The wise maker of alle þingz and shaper of þis worlde hath ordenned ij 
|P_121 
thingz conuenient to þis thing among alle other, þe whiche is þis: Take the beste 
hors dunge þat þou may gete and put hit in a pitte and knede hit faste togedre and 
lete þe pitte or the place be right close daubid. And make after that a bedde of 
askes bynethe and round aboute and þe dunge þere withynne. And in the myddes 
of the fyme wel pastid and knoden, þou shal sette þy vaisshel, þat is to seye, þe 
stillatorie of circulacion vnto þe myddes. For hit is nedeful þat al þe heed of þe 
vaisshel stande openne in þe colde ayer, so þat by vertue of þe fire of þe dunge þat 
mattere that ascendith and riseth vp to þe heed by vertue of þe coldnesse of þ'ayer 
may tourne to watre and descende doune ayen. And thus contynuelly by 
circulacions þou has quynte essence withoute labour and fire withoute fire. 
 
And here I shal shewe to the an other maniere fire in þe same fourme 
as I seide afore. Take þe draffe of the grapes as þay been pressid whenne þe jus is 
oute & doo þerewith as ye dide with þe hors dunge bifore, for hit hath a 
|P_122 
meruaillous fire. Also an other sette þy vaisshel wel closid to a reuerberacion 
in þe sunne and so lete hym stande day and nyght. And so withoute labour 
quynte essence may be wrought. 
 
Here ye may haue quynte [\f. 7v\] essence withoute any coste. For poure 
men the whiche suffren grete pouerte and haue noo monaye may haue quynte 
essence yf thay haue the cunnyng and coste thaym nought. 
 
Almyghty God hath made not oonely in aqua vite but almost in euery thing 
a meruaillous quynte essence, durable and celestial. I pray the openne thy wittis 
and vndirstande trouthe, for corruptible thingz sone been distroyed of þaire owen 
kinde and of þaire owen making, but oure quynte essence shal þaym preserue and 
saue. 
 
Take aqua vite of wyne, for quynte essence is draue oute of aqua vite, þe 
whiche is noo wyne. But vndrestonde whenne wyne is changid into vin aigre, 
þenne the kinde of wyne is tournyd into vine aigre. Ergo, in al clene wyne 
excepte vyne aigre, how rotyn þat euer hit be or trouble or stynkyng, quynte 
essence is kepte and may be purid þere-of. Thenne take this for a rule, yf þou take 
fyne wyne not trouble ne rotyn, þere-of may þou distille beste aqua vite. 
 
|P_123 
Þerefore, poure men and hooly lyuers that haue litel monaye may siche 
suche wynes as men refusen and is loste and þat thay mowe haue for nought, as 
trouble wyne and rotyn in a watery February. For quynte essence whiche is 
incorruptible may not be corrupte by þat rotyn wyne and corrupte, but for þe more 
pertie hit is drunken vp of that corrupte wyne. Ergo, hit may be callid a pryue 
maistrie to draue quynte essence incorruptible fro corrupte wyne. And so by 
sublymacions hit draueth and putrifieth þe iiij elementz of the wyne and leueth þe 
dregges in þe bottume. Now þou may vndrestande þe wirking of hym withoute 
expense. Wolde God ye wolde preyse God and laude hym þere-of. 
 
Here is knowelaiche of the dyuersite of quynte essence and þat may bee 
made parfite and inparfite and after dyuers [\f. 8r\] degrees, higher or lower. 
 
The furste maniere making of oure quynte essence is that the whiche I haue declarid 
bifore, the whiche hath noo pere. 
 
The secunde maniere is this: Take þe beste aqua vite and þe strongest þat 
þou may finde and putte hit withynne a glasyn vaisshel with a long necke and close 
þe mouthe faste with wexe; and lete þe vaisshel be halfe fulle atte moste. Thenne 
þou shal putte al close in þe hors fyme afore seyde so þat al þe vaisshel be vndre 
þe dunge. And vndrestonde wel þis werke, for þe mouthe of þe vaisshel y-stoppid 
with wexe shal be tournyd dovnewarde and þe bottume þere-of shal be vppewarde. 
And so lete hym stande al cloos in hors fyme. And so by vertue of þe fire of þe 
|P_124 
fyme quynte essence shal rise vp to þe bottume of þe vaisshel and þe corrupte 
matiere and þe residence of þat watre shal descende into þe necke of the vaisshel 
withynne þe glasse. Thenne, aftre xl dayes take oute þe vaisshel softely and hourle 
[{ne trouble{] hit not ne shake hit. But as demeurely [{as thou may{] reere hit 
up as hit is standing in þe fyme, þe necke dovnewarde and the bottume vppewarde. 
And þere þou shal se bitwyne the thiknesse and þe clerenesse a greete difference, 
that is to seye, bitwyne quynte essence sublymed and the grosse matieres and 
corrupte þe whiche lithe in the necke. 
 
Maistrie and crafte forto parte þe inpure fro þe pure or þat oone fro þat 
other is this: Take an iren pricke or a poyntel that is right sharpe and perce the 
wexe subtily þerewith vnto the watre. And whenne þou has made an hole unto þe 
watre, drawe hit oute, and so þere shal come oute terrestre matiere & corrupte. 
And so lete hit passe aweye til al þe corrupte be goon. And whenne þou seest hit 
passid al oute and þe clere quynte essence bigynneth to passe also, þenne putte þy 
fyngre vppon þe hole anone. Þenne tourne the potte [\f. 8v\] or the vaisshel et 
|P_125 
there-ynne þou shalt haue quynte essence; and put hit into a vaisshel by hymsilf. 
And þis is holde for a grete maistrie and oon of þe greet secretnesse of 
philosophres. But þis quynte essence is not of so greet valure as is þe furst, for hit 
is ful noble to vse hym sikerly, for þere is greet vertue in hym but not somuche 
as þou shalt finde in parfite quynte essence the whiche þou seches. 
 
The iij=de= maniere is þis: Take a greet glasyn pot and bury hit wel closid in 
hors fyme so þat al þe vaissel be closid in the dunge. And so the pure sprith of 
quynte essence, by heete of þe fyme, hit shal ascende vp and þe grossitude and 
þe corrupte feys shal remayne in the bottume of þe vaissel. Þenne draue subtily 
þat pure and spiritualle matiere that is abouue þe dreggz and put hit into a cloos 
vaissel and put þe remanent ayen into þe dunge. 
 
The iiij maniere is þis: Take what vaissel þou wilte of glas or of erthe 
wel y-glasid and trustily, and sette vppon þat vaissel a rovnde foote of glas with a 
legge comyng oute of þe foote honging withyn þe vaissel in þe ayer. And sette a 
|P_126 
conuenient couering aboue according to þe mouthe of þe vaissel, wel lutid with 
philosophres paste bifore seyde. And so hit shal ascende in maniere of a boilyng 
pot to þe rovnde foote of glas by descente dovne ayen into þe vaissel by þe legge 
honging in the ayer. And þis instrument of glas may be hadde in many places 
withoute greet coste and hit is in partie as goode as þe vaissel of circulacion þat I 
spake of furst. 
 
The v maniere is þis: Take aqua vite made of clene wyne, in þe fyme wel 
digestid and fyned, and use hit. 
 
The vj maniere is this: Take aqua vite ij distilled. 
 
The vij maniere is þis: Take aqua vite þat is reedy made atte hande þat hit 
brenne. For alle thees been ful meruaillous as I shal shewe here aftre. 
 
[}Here is the iii=de= cannon of the pryue extraction of quynte essence of alle 
thingz that been necessarie and profitable in reperacion and conservyng of kinde, 
|P_127 
cunnyng to draue oute quynte essence of man is blode and [\f. 9r\] of alle flesshes, 
egges, and metes that longen to man.}] 
Here bifore I haue shewed to the greet priuetees, ffor I seide in euery 
corrupte thing is parfite quynte essence. Þenne greet maistrie hit were to teche þe 
to draue hym oute of man is blode and of flesshe and of alle bestes, ffor man is 
blode is þe parfiteste þing in vs of kinde to increche al nature loste. Take this for 
certayne þat naturalle shal make quynte essence so perfite þat withoute any oþer 
preperacion of degre of olde men & men that been fleuble, hit shal transfourme 
and change þat blode ymmediate into flessh. And þis quynte essence and his 
propre nature hit is greet mastrie to haue, for þerynne is greet vertue of oure 
sterrid heuene to cumforte and cure nature. And many worthy miracles been 
wrought as I shal teche [{the{] here after. 
 
Take blode of yong sanguyn men and colerike men at barbiers shoppes 
as þou may haue hit, and namely of suche men þe whiche vse good wynes. Þenne 
put awaye þe watre after hit hath stande and paste hit and bake hit with þe x parte 
of comune salte preparat to þe vse and medicines of man. And þenne put hit into a 
glasyn vaisshel and close hit right faste; and put hit withynne hors dunge preperat 
|P_128 
and arayed in forme bifore seide. And renve hit oones in a wyke or more þat 
þe fire of fyme may be made strengere. And so lete hit roote and putrefie til al þe 
blood be tournyd into watre; and þat may be withyn xl dayes, sumtyme more and 
sumtyme lasse. 
 
Thenne put hit into a lembike and distille hit by a good fyre & take þer-of 
þe watre as muche as þou may. Þenne take þe dreggz þat leuen of þat watre and 
grynde þaym on a marble stone; and put al þe watre þere-to and grynde bothe 
togedre and þenne distille hit ayen and þenne grynde þe feces, þat is to seye, 
dreggz, and melle þe watre þerewith ayen and distille hit [{e{]ft sonys. And do 
thus many tymes til þou haue [\f. 9v\] a noble watre of blode of the whiche quynte 
essence may be draue oute. Take þat same watre and put hit into þe stillatorie 
of circulacion as I seyde in þe bygynnyng and lete hym ascende and descende til 
hit be brought to þe greet swetnesse and meruaillous smylling and odour as aqua 
vite or aqua ardent, as I seide bifore. And þat is a meruaillous and a myraculous 
|P_129 
quynte essence as þou shal wel knowe and see. 
 
Yf þou wil draue quynte essence fro capons and hennes and of al maniere 
flessh þat þou wilt, grynde þe flessh or þe eggz strongly and as smalle as þou may 
in a mortier with his x perte of comune salt preperate to þe vse and medicines of 
man. As I seyde byfore, put hit in hors fyme til hit be tournyd into watre in 
maniere afore seide. And þenne put hit, þat is to seye, þe watre so distillid, into 
þe vaisshel of circulacion til þat watre be brought to þe greet swetnesse and 
sauours afore seyde. 
 
[}Cvnnyng to draue quynte essence fro alle frutes and leues, rootes and 
herbs.}] 
And here is oon other of the priuetees to telle: The drauyng of quynte 
essence of alle thingz þat material be mellid and sprunge of þ'erthe. 
 
And þe manniere of þis wirking is as I seide in the last chapitre bifore. 
Grynde alle frutes, rootes, and herbes that þou wilt and for what þou wilt with the 
x parte of salte preperate to þe vse and medicyne of man, as I seide. Þenne 
putrefie hit and distille hit circularit, as I seide bifore, til þou haue þe greet 
|P_130 
swetnesse of greet odour, as I haue seide bifore. 
 
And here I haue openned to þe in þis place, by þe commandement and 
emperalite of Crist, þy desire þe whiche is diffuse to be vndrestande or to be 
vndretake. 
 
And sith hit is so: Þat of herbes, sum been colde atte highest and sum hote 
atte highest, sum drie, sum moiste, sum temperate, sum laxatyue, and sum 
costyue. And þerefore quynte essence draue oute of thees in suche matiers shal 
bee of wondre wirking, [\f. 10r\] for in twynkelyng of an eye, dyuers effectz and 
wondirful been wrought soudaynely. 
 
Why was quynte essence draue oute of ellebre, that oþer-wise is callid 
walworte, as þ'effect is writenn there-of in Latyn? For hit is so high in effect 
of wirking þat noo man may shewe ne telle þe priuete þere-of. And vndrestande 
wel: Yf any herbe, frute, or oþere haue suche a powure by hymsilf, hit hath that of 
quynte essence. For his quynte essence, as we haue seide, was so depurid atte 
fulle bifore þat his vertue is a hunthred folde more þanne whenne hit is in þe 
herbe. For þe dreggz of the iiij elementz mellid togedre suffrith not quynte 
|P_131 
essence, the whiche is drovnyd and compovnyd with þayme to wirke aftre his ful 
kinde. Therefore we yeue maistrie to quynte essence whenne alle superfluelt and 
materialt impedimentz and corrupte bee remouyd fro hym by circle distillacion, as 
we haue seide bifore. 
 
[}Here is the cunnyng to draue quynte essence of euery of the iiij elementz by 
hymsilf of alle the matieres bifore seyde.}] 
I wille not lete for a litel to siche and shewe the priuetees how quynte 
essence of þe iiij elementz of alle thees þingz bifore seide may be draue oute and 
shewed and leyde invisibly in a parte by hymsilf. And þe making is this: Take a 
þing putrefied and brought into a watre, what þat euer þou wilte, as I haue taughte 
and shewed bifore. And þat thing þat þou wilt draue þe iiij elementz of, lete hit be 
man is blode broughte into a watre with his x parte of salt preparate, as I seide 
bifore. Þenne put þat watre or blode so putrefied yn a stillatorie of glas and sette 
hit in a potte with watre and make a fire vndre hit, þat hit may distille fro þe 
myddil of þe lembike to þe pipe; and there þou shal haue bi distillacion a clene 
watre. Receipue hit into a potte of glas þat is right clene. And whenne þou seest 
þat by that fire wille noo more watre arise ne [\f. 10v\] distille, thenne trowe þou 
wel for sothe þat þou hast the pure element of watre oonely of þat blode, for þe 
fire and þe calidite of that watre hath noo strengthe ne myghte to sublyme or 
|P_132 
distille th'ayer or þe fire or th'erthe. 
 
And so thre elementz remaynen in the bottume of þe vaisshel þe whiche 
is the stillatorie. Take that watre þe whiche þou has so draue oute and put hit 
efte sonys in þe vaisshel vppon the iij elementz and put þe stillatorie ouer þe 
into the watre ayen þe space of vij dayes þat thay mowe be wel mellid togedre; but 
close hit so faste þat noo thing may distille oute þere-of. And after vij dayes take 
þe stillatorie and sette hym in a panne fulle of hoote askys and lete þe panne 
with clene askes stande ouer a good fire, for þis fire is mightier þenne is þe fire of 
þe watre in þe potte, þe is callid in þis faculte balneum marie, i. maris vel aque, 
a bathe of watre. And by vertu of þe fire in þe askis þer shal ascende a watre 
in fourme of oyle shynyng in colour of gold. And whenne þou sees þere wol come 
no more, thenne has þou recepued in þy vaisshel ij elementz, þat is to seye, watre 
and ayer. 
 
Thus shal þou departe oon fro an other. Put þaym in a stillatorie of glas 
|P_133 
and sette þe stillatoyre in [{ye pot{] with hoote watre in maniere afore seyde and 
þere shal ascende oonly clere watre. And þenne ayer shal remayne in þe vaisshel 
in likenesse of oyle and in colour of gold in þe bottume of þe vaisshel, þe whiche 
oyle is vray ayer. Put hym bi hymself and yit remaynne in þe vaisshel fire and 
erthe. 
 
To departe fire fro erthe, take iiij li. of þ'element of watre and put hit 
vppon 1 li. of þe matiere, þat is to seye, vppon þe ii elementz fire and erthe. 
And put hit vij dayes þat hit may be wel incorporate in þe hoote watre. And after 
þat put hit ouer a strong flammyng fire and þere shal ascende a reede watre. 
And whenne þere distilleth noo more, þenne has þou a blacke watre in þe bottume 
of the vaisshel þe whiche is pure erthe. Take hit [\f. 11r\] vppe and put hit into a 
vaisshel by hymsilf. Þenne take that redisshe watre, for þere been ij elementz, 
that is to seye, th'element of fire and of watre. Put thayme bothe into þe stillatoire 
and sette hit in þe pot with watre ouer þe fire and þere shal ascende by distillacion 
the clere element of watre. And so shal remayne in þe vaisshel a rede oyle, þe 
whiche is th'element of fire; and here has þou now iiij elementz departid asundre. 
 
The furst is oyle and þat is proprely ayer and watre, ffire and erthe. And 
|P_134 
here ye shal vndrestande þat th'element of watre is caste into þat other elementz 
to draue oute fire and ayer fro erthe, for thay mighten not arise in distillacion 
withoute þe helpe of th'element of watre. 
 
Now bringe euery of thees iiij elementz by hymsilfe into quynte essence in 
the vaisshel of circulacion as I seide bifore or elles rettifie and distille thaym as 
þou didest the wyne byfore, that is to seye, distille þayme vij tymes in an oþer 
stillatoyre. But þe blacke watre in wirking of kinde muste furst be put in a 
glasyer is fourneyse xxij dayes or in þe vaisshel of reuerberacion. And for a 
cause of this cunnyng, I speke no more but joye in God of this that þou has 
herde. 
 
[}The iiij canon in the secrete making of þe maistrie of þe sunne to sette

Now is tyme þat we araye oure heuene, quynte essence, and þat we sette 
oure sterres in hym, þat is to seye, gold and þe propretees of gold, þat ye may 
gete and bringe into man is body þe clerest day of al oure life and greet helthe and 
strength til þe last day þat God hath assigned vs to deye, for þat day may noo man 
passe. 
 
And here is a greet maistrie to sette oure sunne, i. gold, yn [\f. 11v\] oure

bigynnyng is so subtil and so spiritual and y-brought to so greet glorieusenes þat of

glasyn vaisshel sownde and cloos withoute porys, leste he shape and passe oute of 
þy gouuernance. But oure sunne is euene contrary, for he is of so greet 
sufferyng and of so meruaillous sadnesse þat fire may not waste hym by noo witte 
ne reason, as I shal shewe by exemple and withoute any doute. Alle men wittes 
mowen not waste hym by noo crafte of askes to calcyne hym in, yn þe whiche 
alle metalles been distroyed and loste, gold and syluer except. And þough þou 
|P_136 
woldes take sement royalle, þat is þe strongest þing þat may be distruyng and 
wasting of metalles þe whiche is made of olde salt and brymstone and sal 
armonyak with the whiche þe best siluer of þe world is brought to nought and 
tournyd into corrupcion, but gold þerewith may not be wastid; but hit is þe gretter, 
fyner and purer þanne euer hit was. And þat is but of th'ordennance of God fro

and made so worthy, and þe foorme and kinde of þat matiere been knytte togedre 
and so strong joyned in oon þat by mighte and vertue of þe fire he may neuer be 
corrupte and departid. And now I seye to þe þat God of heuene, by influence of 
the vij [{planetes{], hath disposid in þe bowelles of th'erthe vij metalles. 
 
Saturne disposith leed for leed hath þe propretees of Saturne. Þerefore 
leed is callid Saturne. 
 
Jupiter disposith tynne and for tynne hath þe proprietees of Jupiter, þerefore 
tynne is callid Jubiter. [\f. 12r\] Mars disposith ire and for ire hath þe propretees of 
|P_137 
Mars, therefore we calle ire, Mars. The sunne, þe whiche is þe noblest

quyke siluer and for quyke siluer hath þe propretes of mercury, þerefore we callen

And sith gold is disposid of þe sunne and hath þe propretees of þe sunne. 
And þe sunne yeueth his coursshe and kinde influence vnto þ'erthe: of his beemes

And now is tyme to shewe how þe naturalle influence of oure sunne, þat is 
to seye oure gold, shal be sette in oure heuene, quynte essence, þat we spake of 
bifore. For þe light and þe heete and þe corruptible goodnesse of alle his 
|P_138

to vs assigned. 
 
[}Here is veraye practise, crafte, and maistrie to sette oure sunne in heuene, 
oure quynte essence.}] 
A werke of þe maistrie to sette oure sunne in heuene and hit is þis: Take the 
gold of God y-purid by sement royal, yf þou may haue suche gold. And yf þou be 
a pouer man, take fyne floryns of Florence, oþer wise callid ducatz, and make 
þer-of thynne plates. And put þoo plates into þe fire and anele þaym fire rede 
vppon an iren pele as hoote as þou may. And haue biside the a erthyn vaisshel wel 
glasid ful of fyne brennyng watre and [\f. 12v\] whenne thy platz been fire hoote, 
caste þaym withynne watre ardent but take hede to quenche the brennyng watre þat 
hit waste not and be wel ware þat noon ire touche þat watre. But standing a ferre, 
caste ynne þy golden platz and do so 1 tymes or more, for þe more þe bettre hit 
shal be. Note þis wel þat I seyde, yf þou see the watre ouer muche wastid, þenne 
take and change hit and take newe and so aftre þat an other. And whenne alle þe 
quencherys been doon, þenne caste alle þe watres togedres. 
 
And vndrestande þat God hath sette suche vertue in aqua ardent þat hit 
|P_139 
draueth to hym alle þe vertues of gold. Whenne thay been fire hote and in 
corporacion, hit holdeth þe beemys and þe lighte and þe equale colour and 
hardnesse and sadnesse and alle þe propretees of þe sunne celestial. This aqua 
ardent is so glorieusely y-sunnyd and gilte, medle hit with quynte essence and 
vse hit. 
 
Þou shalt not quenche þy golden plates in quynte essence for þou mighte 
lose þaym þenne. Now in veray trouthe: þy heuene þou hast incorruptible but not 
fully as heuene, and þi sunne y-sette in hym more mightier to yeue light of lyfe in 
þe beemys of vertue in conservyng of kinde and to make quynte essence in biding 
and sadde. 
 
Here is cunnyng withoute expenses and almoste for nought and this is 
for hooly lyuers that haue litel to lyue by, parfit men, the whiche seyen with 
Petre, "golde and siluer is not longyng to me." And whenne þay haue nede of þe 
vertues of oure sunne, lete þaym pray a riche frend to leeue þaym ij good floryns 
of Florence or 1. And hete hym as reede as fire is [{in{] colour; and yf þou haue 
aqua ardent, quenche þaym þere-ynne 1 tymes. And yf þou haue noo aqua ardent, 
|P_140 
quenche þaym in good white wyne, not ouer clere nor thicke but in the moste 
delectable and [\f. 13r\] odorous and best liking þat þou may haue. For wyne hath 
kinde to recey[{u{]e in hym alle þe propretees of gold. And whenne þou haste 
doon þis werke at þe fulle, þou shal haue þy floryns as good as þay were bifore 
and as who seyeth of þe same weighte. Vse this goldyn wyne or watre and þou 
shal haue greet helthe and gladnesse and be yongly with al. 
 
[}Here is crafte and cunnyng to sette the vertues of oure sunne more 
strenger and mightyer in oure heuene.}] 
And here in this decre I shal shewe a witte þat þe propretees of oure sunne 
shal be sette more parfite shynyng in oure heuene. But I shal teche þe a sleyghte 
naturally and withoute synne to bringe gold and siluer to suche a plyte þat noo 
man shal knowe hit by right ne reason noþer sighte, but vttrely þay shal be 
deceipued. And þis cunnyng and deceipte of gold and siluer is muche worthe in 
tyme of traison to bere and to kepe hym fro tyrandes in sykernesse and in werris 
and greete tribulacouns and namely in þe tyme of Antecrist. 
 
|P_141 
Allemighty God made gold incorruptible and so noble þat fire by noo crafte 
may distroye his colour ne vertue. And yt þere is a thing þe whiche tourneth hym 
into erthe sodaynely. Þe maistrie of þis preuyte is this: Take gold and make 
lymelle of hym; þenne take a crucible with a good quantite of quyke siluer and put 
hit into a litel fire þat hit rise not and vapore aweye. And þen put thy lymelle of 
gold þer-to and þenne moeue hit a litel þat þe gold and þe quyke siluer may be 
medlid togedres. And withyn a litel while þou shal finde al þe gold withynne þe 
quyke siluer y-tournyd into erthy mele or floure. Þenne make þe fire strengere þat 
þe quyke siluer may passe aweye or elles distille hit and gadre hit ayen by putting 
to of a lembike aboue þe vaisshel. And so þou shal finde þe gold calcyned and 
tournid into [\f. 13v\] erthe. And yf þou may not lymel hit, make þere-of as thynne 
plates and subtile as þou maist and put thaym to þe quyke siluer al hote, and þou 
shalt haue þy desire. And yf þou wil do þe same with siluer, lymel hit and medle 
hit with crude mercury and with mercury sublymed and a goode quantite of 
vitriolle romayne and close hit with philosophres lute bytwyne ij vaisshellz or ij 
shelles wel closid; and put hit among coles the space of a day or halfe a day, and 
þenne þou shal finde hit tournyd into calse. Thees calces þou may bere þorough 
oute al þe worlde and noo man knowe hit for noo gold nor siluer. And yf þou wil 
nedely hide þees calces, medle þaym with molten pytche or wexe or gumme or 
with any þing that is able to brenne & þere shal noo man knowe hit, but euery man 
that seeth hit shal vtterly be deceipued. 
 
|P_142 
And yf þou wil loose þis matiere and bring hit as hit was, put þe wexe with 
þe gold or þe picche in a vaisshel with hote clene askys and þe gold shal passe 
into þ'askes and be calce as hit was afore; and þe same of siluer. 
 
Now to oure purpoos. Yf þou noble and worthy wil gilte oure aqua ardent 
or wyne, take þe calce of þat I spake of right now and put hit on a iren pele, but 
better hit were a siluer spone. Þenne anele hit fire hoote and quenche hit in aqua 
ardent or wyne l tymes, as ye dide bifore, and þou shal haue þy licour y-giltid an 
hunthrid-folde better þenne hit was with the thynne plates. And the cause and 
reason is this: For þe fyre wirketh better, mightyer, and strenger in þe subtil 
pouder and calce of gold þenne in sounde plates and harde. And aqua ardent or 
wyne draueth a thowsandfolde bettre þe kinde and þe propretees of gold fro þe 
smalle parties fire hoote þenne fro greet plates. For subtil plates of gold and smale 
withstanden lesse the fire þenne [\f. 14r\] the substancial body. 
 
And þou shal vndrestande þat wyne holdeth not oonely þe propretees of 
gold but of alle metalles. For yf þou quenche moltyn leede in wyne or in 
comune watre vij tymes, þenne in þat wyne or watre, yf þou wil quenche ire 
wellyng hote many tymes and ofte, þenne shal þe ire be nesshe as leede; and þe 
|P_143 
same with coper and other metalles. Yf þou quenche ire ofte tymes in white 
wyne and after þat quenche þe hote moltyn leede þere-ynne ofte tymes, and þenne 
þou shal finde þe leede harde as þe ire was. Ergo, hit foloweth þat þe propretees 
of alle metalles mowe entre into wyne and muche raþer into aqua ardent, precious 
and good. 
 
[}The V canon of infixion of alle erthely sterres in oure heuene þat thay 
mowe shewe thayre propre influence and priue vertues.}] 
God of heuene hath yeue suche vertue to quynte essence þat hit draueth of euery 
frute, tree, herbe, seedes, spicz, and flesshe, and of euery medicynal thing alle vertues 
and propretees and natures, and alle manier effectz of þaym, þe 
whiche God, maker of joye, hath shape and made in þaym. And withynne iij 
houres he shal draue oute alle þaire vertues into hymsilf. And þis oure quynte 
essence afor seyde draueth alle quynte essence of alle þingz afore seyde. 
 
Ergo, alle þingz necessary to euery sirupe: Put hit in aqua ardent and 
withynne iij houres, þat shal be a sirupe. And þerefore hit shal be an hunthryd-folde 
more bettre by reason of quynte essence þenne hit shuld be withoute hit. 
|P_144 
And in þis wise, take alle medicynes comfortatyues and put þaym with 
quynte essence and hit shal be an hunthrid folde better cumfortatyfe þenne hit was 
bifore in alle actes and propretees; the same in medicynes laxatifes, for þay shal 
werke wondrefully in kinde and þaire vertues shal gretely bee increchid [\f. 14v\] 
of the highyste of God as I shal teche the hereafter. 
 
And yf þou putte alle spices and alle swete smyllengz and odorous sauours 
withynne quynte essence, þou shalt haue so greet swettenes þat wondre hit is to 
seye. The same of stiptike thingz, þat is to seye, drynkes made newe of frute, as 
wyne sidre or perry newe made and suche other. The same of þingz that been 
restreynyng, bee þay seedes or floures, frutes or leefz, or colde or hote, or swete 
or biter, or moyste or drie, or goode or ylle; yf þou putte any of thees in quynte

[}Here is cunnyng to sette humidite in oure heuene in þe secunde degre. And 
here is a note of necessary thinges to that.}] 
Conuenyent hit is to shewe and openne thingz that been moiste in þe ij=de= 
degre þat we may sette quynte essence in heuene þat hit may yeue moystnes in þe 
|P_162 
secunde degre to oure bodies when neede askith. 
 
Of herbes: malowes, psillium, fole [\f. 19v\] fote, arage, gardyne letuce, 
fisaune, fole fote. 
 
Of flours: watre lily. 
 
Of frutz: dates, cheryes, gourdes, notz, cucurbita, citerly. 
 
Of cornes: ffacy, kernelles of quynches. 
 
Now here bee þoo thingz þe whiche yeuen moisture in the ii=de= degre in 
oure heuene, yf thay been sette in hym. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to sette moystnes in oure heuene in the iii=de= degre and 
whiche been þoo þingz that been moiste in þe iij degre. Thees thingz been moiste 
in þe iij degre.}] 
Of seedes: the seede of psillium, white popy, oygnon seede. 
 
Of flours: flours of violette, white popy. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to sette humidite in heuene in the iiij=the= degre.}] 
|P_163 
This is þe laste consideracion in respecte of thingz as longen to þe 
qualitees of iiij grees. And yit we mowe seye whiche been thoo þingz that 
been moiste in þe iiij degre þat we may sette quynte essence of thaym in heuene 
þat hit may yeue moisture in oure body in þe iiij degre whenne neede askith. And 
þees been moiste in the iiij degre. 
 
Of veynes: quycke siluer. 
 
Of drynkes: snowe and leptoma. 
 
Now bi the helpe of God we haue fynysshed the iiij canons afore in 
frutefulle consideracion and profitable of iiij grees in hote thingz, colde, drie, and 
moyste. To God be þe preising. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to knowe of alle thees thingz bifore seyde whiche of thaym 
haue ij propretees.}] 
I haue shewed to þe thingz ful necessary and cunnyng to knowe of euery 
thing what proprete hit hath and what complexion. For euery thing þat is made 
of iiij elementz hath moo propretees þan oon. For th'element of watre is bothe 
|P_164 
colde and moyste; th'aier, hote and moiste; th'erthe cold and drye; the fire, hote 
and drie. 
 
And þerefore þe iiij pure qualitees þe whiche are hote and moyste, colde 
and drie, haue iiij maniere combinacions according to [\f. 20r\] gedre in the iiij 
elementz. And so þere been oonely iiij elementz and iiij combinacions. Bothe 
drie and moyste, þe whiche been ij contraries, may not bee togedre in 
oone substance. 
 
Ergo whenne þou wilt knowe any of thees thinges to fore seyde, whethre 
hit be hote and moyste, or hote and drie, or colde and moiste, or colde and drie, 
seche hit in þe chapitre of hote thingz. And yf þou finde hit þere, wryte of þat 
þing þat hit is hote and moiste in suyche a gre, and þere þou shalt finde þe 
|P_165 
complexion of hym. And þat þou opennely vndrestande what I seye, seche 
quycke siluer in þe chapitre of hoote þingz and þou shal finde hit hote in þe iiij 
degre hit wryht. Thenne aftre that, seche hit in þe chapitre of moyste thingz. 
And þere hit is moiste in þe iiij degre, þat is to seye, moiste in þe highest degre. 
 
And ye shal vndrestande þat the furst degre may not extende in wirkyng of 
kynde but as a cochyng, and apeyreth not þe wittz. The ii degre is euene to þe 
wittes. The iij degre passith the wittes but not distroyeth hit. But þe iiij degre 
hurteth and mahaymeth þe wittes. And of þis consideracion of iiij degrees of 
ordre, qualite is take. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to sette in oure heuene moste temperate complexion 
abouue alle other þingz.}] 
Here I shal reherche thingz moste temperate of þe whiche we shal draue 
oute quynte essence þat we may sette in oure heuene moste temperate complexion 
in oure body þat may be in þis worlde. 
 
And þees thingz been most temperate and eueneste to oure complexion and 
|P_166 
highest to cumforte and contynuelle restoryng: oure gold of God and not of man, i. 
of alkymye; perle; antheras; capillus veneris, i. mayden heere; rote of lay; cassia 
fistula, i. cayfuste; manne. 
 
Draue oute quynte essence of þees and sette þaym in oure heuene. [\f. 20v\] 
For thenne quynte essence shal lighte parfitely in vs helthe contynuelle and 
life til þe laste day assigned to vs of God. 
 
And nowe I haue tolde hough þou shalt sette quynte essence of gold, yf hit 
be perle or of goldyn cathymy or suyche oþer. Yf þou wilte sette quynte essence 
of thayme in heuene, make as smal poudre of þaym as þou may; and þanne put 
that poudre in oure heuene and hit shal draue to hym parfitely all vertues and 
quynte essence of thoo thinges in þe space of iij houres, as I haue seyde bifore in 
þe v canon. 
 
[}The x canon techith to sette quynte essence of thinges that been attractife 
in oure heuene þat we may drawe oute of woundes, tre or ire.}] 
|P_167 
Sette we in oure heuene quynte essence to draue oute fro oure body tre or 
ire þe whiche is in oure body by shotte or strooke. And alle attractifz of necessite 
moste needes be hote to make þe flessh subtile and softe. 
 
And attractifes been thees: magnes, serapinum, azafetida, maiorane,

And sum han vertue of digestion in þe stomake and cumforten hit, as

and þay shal cumforte vertue and nature of man that meruaille hit is to seye. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to sette quynte essence in oure strength and vertue to put 
aweye venem fro oure body.}] 
Oure heuene shal haue greete vertue to put aweye venym yf þou put þees 
þingz þere-ynne, that is to seye, the flessh of a cok or of a henne, notz, and the 
greete triacle, i. aloe cicatrinum, and þe lasse triacle, radissh, or any other that 
been contrary to venym aftre þe rule of phisik. I sette not þat þou shalt put alle 
thees in oure heuene, i. quynte essence, but oone of thaym and þat sufficeth. 
 
[}Here [\f. 26r\] is the consideracion of draueng oute of quynte essence of 
|P_184 
gold. Here þou may leere in this chapitre foloweng.}] 
Though I haue shewid here bifore to draue quynte essence that sufficeth to 
oure purpoos, nat withstanding I shal teche þe to draue hit oute of alle myneralle, 
i. alle mynes of metallz, and furst and principally of gold. And in þis maniere þou 
shal bringe þi golde into calce by þe crafte that I haue taughte bifore in the iiij 
canon. Thenne þou shalt put vin aigre distilled or olde vryne in a glasen vaisshel, 
and late the liquor be iij fynger thicke, and put þe calce of gold withyn þe liquor 
and sette hit in a strong hote sunne in the hattest tyme of somer. And lete hit 
stande stille and þou shalt see as hit were a crayme or a reme of gold rise on þe 
liquor or like oyle of gold suiymmyng or flutyng aboue like a skynne þat is wondre 
thynne. Gadre hit with a spone or a fethre and put hit into an other vaisshel wel 
glasid with a litel watre in the same vaisshel afore. And so ofte tymes in þe day 
gadre that matiere þat riseth so vppe til þou haue al and þat þere wil no more 
ascende. Thenne make þe watre vapore awey bi a fire oute of þe vaisshel and 
þenne shal remayne in þe vaisshel quynte essence of vray golde. And many men 
callen this quynte essence y-draue oute in this wise, oyle incombustible, þe whiche 
was ordenned and put for a greete pryuyte of philosophres. 
 
And yf þou wil putte þis quynte essence in oure heuene withoute any 
|P_185 
falshode, þou shalt restore nature loste and brynge ayenn vertue of youthe and to 
lengthe oure lyfe til þe laste daye y-ordenned of God. 
 
Now I haue openned to the oone of þe grettest priuitees in cumfortyng of 
kinde, and oone of thoo þingz that shuld not be openned. And þis quynte essence 
of gold [\f. 26v\] hath þe gretteste swetnes and vertue to swage ache and malice of 
woundz and to heele woundz and bouches and many other dyuers infirmitees. 
And truste þis welle for trouthe. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to draue quynte essence oute of siluer, lede, and tynne.}] 
Though quynte essence may be draue of siluer as wel as of gold in the 
same wise, yit shal þou haue an other maner crafte as I shal teeche the. And þe 
maistrie of þis werke is to haue þe beeste vin aigre distilled þat þou may haue and 
put þer-to a noble tarter calcyned and sal armonyak, and schette þaym alle togedre 
in a potte faste y-closid or elles þe might and vertue shal fle oute by reason of 
þ'armoniak þat is put þere-ynne. Furst of alle þou shal putte thy calce of siluer as 
I haue taught bifore, þenne cloose hit faste with philosophres lute & putte hit into a 
hote fournays þat hit may putrefie viij or x dayes. Thenne aftrewarde putte hit yn 
|P_186 
a distillatorie and distille hit. And furst of alle shal ascende þe vin aigre and after 
that, meruely hit is to seye, þere shal distille quynte essence of siluer in similitude 
of quyke siluer, þe whiche is of suyche kinde and vertue in wirkingz þe whiche 
been so meruaillous þat thay bee not to be shewed. 
 
[}Here is quynte essence of siluer and vitriol romayne and coperose.}] 
Oure glorious Lord hath so y-ordenned þat quynte essence of vitriol and 
coperose with quyke siluer mow be draue oute ynuysible. For whenne quyke 
siluer is sublymed with þaym and with comune salte, and þere shal ascende by 
sublimacion quyke siluer most whitteste withynne þe whiche [{ye quinta{] essence 
of vitriol and coperose shal invisibly be closid. For whenne þou has quyke siluer 
sublimed with thees, þenne has þou quynte essence of thaym inuisibly inclosid and 
hidde withynne þe whitnesse of þe quike siluer afore seyde. And [\f. 27r\] that 
quynte essence afore seide is callid sulphur of philosophres, þe whiche is inuisible. 
|P_186 
And þerefore þay seyen þat thaire sulphur is noo comun sulphur. And þere are 
but fewe men þat haue knowelaiche or vndrestanding of this matiere. 
 
And þis is he that congelith mercury anone and bringeth hym to whitnes 
and maketh hym whitter þenne þe snowe. And for thay been of oon kinde; 
þerefore thay bee sublimed togedre. And vndrestonde welle þat quyke siluer 
sublimed hath sum parties to vrent and hath quynte essence, þe whiche may not 
be corrupte by noo crafte ner witte. 
 
And we see by experience, yf a man putte siluer lymelle in a corrosife 
watre made of vitriol and sal petre, alle þat shal tourne into laton. 
 
Also putte quyke siluer sublimed with coperose or vitriolle and white 
comun salte withynne þe coperose watre to fore seide til þe quyke silure be al 
dissoluyd into watre. Thenne putte al that matiere into a stillatorie and distille hit 
and þere shal distille furst þe coperose water and after þat þere shal come quynte 
essence of mercury and vitriol togedre as white as any snowe. And þere shal 
remayne a parte of þe mercury in þe bottume of þe vaisshel brent and foule. Take 
|P_188 
þat quynte essence and medle hit with þe dreggz in þe vaisshel and putte al þe 
coperose watre fore seyde there-to and sublyme hit so ofte tymes til þere remayne 
noo dreggz at þe laste ende. And þenne has þou quynte essence of mercury and 
vitriol togedre. 
 
And yf a man might sundre thaym, he mighte doo many maistries, ffor þere 
been many grete priuetees in tho matieres. For quynte essence þer-of is 
incorruptible and of þe nature of incorruptible gold; and þat is more incorruptible 
þanne gold. 
 
And yf þou desire to parte quynte essence of coperose and vitriol fro quynte 
essence of mercury, putte hit in vin aigre distilled or in oþer vin aigre and lete hit 
resolue a [\f. 27v\] long space. And þenne shalt þou haue þe mercurye in the 
bottume of þe vaisshel. And shal þenne remayne pure quynte essence aboue 
myxte with þe vin aigre of vitriol and coperose þe whiche is inperceptable to 
man is sighte. 
 
And here by experience, þou shalt see þe trouthe. Take clene ire and 
quenche hit ofte tymes in vin aigre. And aftre þat þou has quenched þy ire in 
clene vin aigre, þenne hete hit and quenche hit in þe vin aigre þat quynte essence is 
yn of vitriol and coperose. And þy ire shal be so rede þat mervaille hit is to seye. 
|P_189 
For hit is þe highest rede þat may be. Distille hit by a filtre, þenne put hit to a 
softe fire and gadre the blac cloudes awey, þe whiche shal be gendrid þere-yn by 
fumositees and hete of þe fire. Thenne þou shal haue remayneng in þe vaisshel 
quynte essence purer þenne any gold. And þis quynte essence is noble and 
precious in hymself. For he availleth to woundes and sores þat needen corrosifes. 
And quynte essence of mercury heleth a sikenesse þat is callid fistula and þe 
cancre and many other wicked infirmitees. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to draue quynte essence of ire and copre.}] 
To draue quynte essence of ire and copre, take þe lymelle of þaym and put 
hit withynne vin aigre. And put þer-to comun salt or armonyak and sette hit in a 
strong hote sunne. And of the ire, þere shal rise vppe crocus ferri; and of the 
copre þere shal come grene copre, þe whiche is callid flos eris, i. þe flour of 
copre. But þou shalt putte oone of thees metallz by hymsilf in þe vin aigre, þat is 
to seye ire by hymsilf and copre by hymsilf, and with vin aigre and lede þynne 
platid þou shalt make quynte essence. And alle thees availlen to medicynes. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to draue quynte essence of sulphur [\f. 28r\], i. 
|P_190 
brymstone, and of orpyment.}] 
Doo make poudre of brymstone and put hit in olde vryne, þenne sette hit 
ouer a softe fire til þe vrine be wel coloured. Take þat vrine so colourid & put hit 
by hymsilf in an other vaisshel. And þenne putte more vrine vppon þe brymstone 
and put hit to þe fire til hit be wel coloured & put hit to þe furste vryne colourid 
with þe brymstone. And putte alle þees vrines þus colourid togedre in a vaisshel 
and sette hit on þe fire and lete al þe vrine vapoure awey. And þere shal 
remayne to the quynte essence of sulphur in þe bottume of þe vaisshel. Thenne 
putte hit in a wide vaisshel with vyn aigre til a softe fire. And yf any thing of 
þe fatnesse of þe sulphur be dissolued þereon by vertue of þe vin aigre, hit shal be 
vaporid and lifte vppe til þe blac cloudes þe whiche shal remayne and put hit 
awey with a fethre. And þere shal remayne in þe vaisshel quynte essence of 
sulphur þe whiche is so clene þat þe beaute of gold may not be lykened to hym. 
And in þe same maniere wise þou shal wirke in oþer thinges, as in arsenike, auriat 
and rede, and in alle other. 
 
|P_191 
[}Here is cunnyng to draue quynte essence of antymony, i. a leden marke 
sede.}] 
God of heuene he is witnesse þat I shal shewe so grete a priuete and 
expresse hit to youre knowelaiche, þe whiche was neuer shewed ner knowe but to 
fulle fewe men. And here is þe pryuete of al secretenesse to draue quynte essence 
of antymony, þe whiche is made in þis wise. Take antymony and grynde hit as 
smalle as þou may. Whenne þou has doo so, þenne take þe nobleste vin aigre 
distillid þat þou can haue and putte þe poudre of antymony þere-ynne and sette hit 
ouer [\f. 28v\] a softe fire til þe vin aigre wexe verry rede. Whenne hit is so, put 
oute þe vin aigre softe and subtily into a vaisshel of glas fro þ'antymony. Þenne 
put newe vin aigre þere-to to þ'antymony ayen and sette hit ouer þe fire in 
maniere bifore seyde, til hit be colourid. Þenne put hit of as þou didest bifore to 
þe furst colourid; and do so ofte tymes as þou may haue þy vin aigre colourid. 
And whenne þou haste gadrid alle þees parcelles of colourid vin aigre togedre, put 
þaym alle in a stillatoire of glas and distille þaym. And furst of alle þere shal 
arise vin aigre by hymsilf and after þat þou shal see a meruaillous myracle. For by 
|P_192 
þe pipe of þe lembike, þere þou shal see a M=l= veynes small of þe blessid 
myne of antymony descending with smale rede droppes as hit were vray rede 
blode, þe whiche blessid liquour þou shal gadre and kepe in a vaisshel of glas by 
hymsilf. And whenne þou has þis, þenne þou has a thing þe whiche al þe tresoure 
of þis worlde may not be lykenid to in comparison of valour, quantite for 
quantite. 
 
See here an openne myracle how greete swetnesse þis quynte essence of 
antymony hath in hymsilf, for þat passith þe swetnesse of any hony in alle 
degrees. 
 
And I sey to þe of godly intencion and vray charite, þat man is witte may 
not conceyve ne bilyue þe valour ner þe mervailleuse vertue of þe quynte essence 
of antymony afore seyde. What shal I seye to þe? Aristotil seyeth in his boke De 
Secretis Secretorum þat þis quynte essence afore seyde is his lede þough he name 
hit not by his propre name of antymony, as we haue reherchid ofte tymes 
bifore. 
 
Truste me wel þere was neuer noo thing of so grete secretnesse as þis is ner 
noo þing of so grete wirking in kinde. Vndrestande what I seye: Alle men han y-labouryd 
|P_193 
to sublyme þe spiritz of myne and þay myghten [\f. 29r\] neuer brynge hit 
aboute. And yf I sey to þe a M=l=. tymes þis is þe secrete priuete of alle þe 
priuytees, yt may I not suffice by no witte to shewe alle vertues ner half of þaym 
and priuetees þat been in hym. For hit taketh awey grete ache of alle woundes and 
heleth þaym meruaillousely; his vertues been mervailleuses profitable and 
incorruptible. 
 
Thenne þou shal put hit in a potte xl dayes faste y-closid in hors fyme þat 
hit may putrefie; and þenne hit shal wirke grete meruailles. This is a grete 
woundre þat of þat pure myne of antymony may come to so greete swetnesse. 
Trowe not þis inpossible þat I haue shewed to þe, for yf þou put ceruse in vin aigre 
and distille hit and þenne hit set ouer a easy fire þe space of ij houres or more til 
þe vin aigre be vapourid awey, þat hit be tournyd into þe thiknesse of oyle. And 
þat oyle is callid oleum plumby, i. oyle of lede, and hit is swete as hony. But þe 
swetnesse of quynte essence of antymony, þe whiche is rede, passeth hit many 
folde, ffor in þis antymony been many woundre pryvitees. For he passeth þe 
swetnesse of hony or sugre or any oþer swetnesse, bylyue me yf þou wilte. 
|P_194 
Siche alle þe bokes of philosofres and in serche what is philosophres plumbe. 
And þou shalt neuer find what hit is in wirking in noo crafte but mercury, þe 
whiche þe myne þere-of may be sublymed into redenesse. Joy in oure Lord of þat 
I haue shewid to the here in this matiere. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to reduce mercury sublymed or the quynte essence of hym 
into watre the whiche among philosofres is callid lac virgineum, i. mayden is 
mylke.}] 
Euery spirite sublymed as mercury or quynte essence of hym, or arsenyk, 
sulphur, armoniak, but specially mercury [\f. 29v\] to brynge to watre or lac 
virgyne, as philosophres named hit furst. 
 
And here is þe makyng þere-of. Take merkury sublymed or quynte essence 
of mercury and put in a glasyn vaisshel or in a potte wel glasid and sette hit in a 
fournays of þe philosophres ordonnance on iij fete, where is a meruaillous witte. 
For that matiere that is putte there-yn shal euenely be digestid in euery partie. 
 
|P_195 
The whiche fournays is made on þis wise: Make þe walles of þy fournays 
nexte þ'erthe rounde in þe altitude of half a fote. And þenne on þy walle sette 
an iren plate on þis maniere wise shape .x.; and sette hit so þat þe plate in 
hymsilf touche not þe walles of þe fournays, but lete þe plate be susteyned and 
borne vppe with iiij armes that been strenthid oute fro þe plate so þat þe hete þe 
whiche shal ascende fro þe fire þat is vndre may ascende by þe sides of þe plate 
and by þe circuyte of hym, and surgete. Þou moste make a dore in thy fournays 
nexte þ'erthe where þou may put yn thy fire or coles. Þenne, fro þe plate upwarde 
make thy fournays rounde to þ'altitude of half thy pavme or þere-aboute; lete hit 
not passe muche þe highnes of ij fingres. And þou shal sette abouue þy fournays a 
rovnde couering, as rovnde as hit may be made in maniere like to a voute that shal 
be made by þe conseil and crafte of a potter. And so þy fournays shal be cloos 
abouue. And also in þe side of þy fournays abouue þy plate þou muste haue a 
hole, the whiche muste haue a closer þere-to to stoppe hit and to oppenne hit, 
|P_196 
whenne þou wilte. And loke þy closer be of erthe. And here has þou þy fournays. 
 
Here may þou vndrestande þat þis fournays shal yeue euenely hete in euery 
parte rovnde aboute, ffor þe hete by cause of the plate is lete fro bynethe and so hit 
is caste uppe by þe sides. The reflection of hete [\f. 30r\] cometh euene like fro 
euery parte of the myddes. And þerefore of cunnyng of reason we haue made oure 
fournace rovnde. 
 
And whenne we wille sette a vaisshel yn oure fournace, in þe myddis of þe 
plate, lete vs ordeyne iij tethe þe highnesse of ij fingers. And of trewe 
ymaginacion lete hym be wrought et sette hym yn iij parties of þe plate in euene 
distance fro other. And vppon þe iij tethe sette a vaisshel of erthe fourmyd like a 
plater so þat þe vaisshel may stonde euene in þe ayer. And with þ'erthyn plater we 
muste haue other iij tethe lesse þenne þe other, i. shorter. Vppon þis vaisshel sette 
we oure glasyn vaisshel with oure matiere wel closid, þe whiche shal bee closid 
and couerid aboue with an other erthen plater so þat bitwyne ij platers in þe 
myddes of þe voute euene in þe myddes of th'ayer, þy matiere shal be sette and 
stonde and not touche þe bottume þere-of nor þe sides nethir aboue ner bynethe in 
noo maniere partie. And for þe hede or þe voute aboue, the whiche is as he seyeth 
halfe þe fournace, may be lifte vppe and openned. So we mowe lose hit and 
openne hit and couer hit whenne we wille. 
 
This is the secretest fournace þat may bee, þe whiche is oon of philosophres 
|P_197 
secretz. And ful fewe men vndrestonde or knowe þe makyng of þis fournace. Yn 
þis fournace is euene digestion and like in euery parte of hete. 
 
Now yf þou wilte reduce any spirite sublymed and brynge hit into watre 
or brynge mercury sublymed into lac virgineum, i. mayden is mylke, sette on þe 
plate on þe iij thothid plater and lette alle maniere matiers diligently bee grovnde 
smalle & lete hit stonde openne and vnclosid, þat þe hote ayer may touche þe bare 
spirite or matiere alone. And make þy fire next th'erthe of iij or iiij coles, for a 
litel fire and a easy shal suffice in this wirking. [\f. 30v\] Contynue this fire bisely 
the space of viij dayes and nyghtz þere-to. And so in þis fournace and stewe, þe 
whiche is hote and drie, the spirit shal be calcyned. 
 
Thenne take hit oute and grynde hit right smalle on a marble stone til hit be 
as smalle as þou mayste. Þenne put hit yn a stillatorie of glas and sette hit in a 
cauderon with water, but lete not þe vaisshel touche þe watre ner come nygh hit by 
þe thickenesse of ij fingres, but lete hit honge in th'ayer. And make a fire vndre 
þe cauderon. And so in þat stewe hote and moyste, though the matiere of 
mercury touche not þe watre, yt shal þe spirit be resoluid into watre. And þe 
cause is for þe spirit is wel calcyned and smalle grovnde to subtile poudre. 
|P_198 
Thenne whenne hit is dissoluid into watre, sette a lembike there-vppon and þere 
shal distille lac virgineum, i. mayden is mylke, moste clereste þe whiche is quynte 
essence proprely bothe of mercury and of vitriol togedre. And þis quynte essence 
is secretum secretorum, i. the priuete of alle priuetees. 
 
And þou muste knowe þe mesure of þy fire in digestion of alle spiritz that 
been volatife or fleyng in þe fournace. And in þis wise þou shalt knowe whenne 
þy fire is hote. Put yn þy hande at þe dore a litel abouue þe plate and yf þou holde 
hit þere-ynne withoute brennyng, hit is wel ynowe; and yf þou may not, make þy 
fire lesse. And be wel ware of tho thingz þat been fugitife, ffor hit is needeful þat 
hit be wel closid in a glasyn vaisshel and þat þe fire be right litel and easy. Nowe 
vndrestonde wel þe draueng oute of quynte essence in þis partie, as I haue 
reherchid, and bilyue þis for trouthe, for þis is a grete thing. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng to make ful able fire the whiche is withoute cole, 
withoute flamme, withoute light, and wyrking ayens alle actions of visible fire and 
[\f. 31r\] wircheth as feruently as hit were the fire of helle.}] 
The excellence and þe secretenesse ignis adepti, i. of þe ful able fire, is so 
grete and of suche vertue þat hit may not be shewyd. And this is the making there-of. 
|P_199 
Take mercury sublymed with vitriol and commun salt, butte quynte essence of 
mercury bifore seyde is muche better. And take sal armonyak vij or x tymes 
sublymed, of euery like muche, and medle þaym togedre and grynde thaym 
diligently. And þenne sprede thy poudre þere-vppon þe marble stone and sette a 
night in þe colde ayer and bright or in colde celer; and þere hit shal be tournyd 
into a watre. Receipue þat watre yn a glasin vaisshel wel anelid and kepe hit. 
This watre is of grete wirching. For yf þat a litel droppe falle on þe hande of a 
man, in þe twynkeling of an eye, hit shal perche hit hande. And in þe same wise 
hit wirchet yf hit falle on a plate of copre or of ire. 
 
And this is a grete vertue, þat yf þou caste any of thees metalles þere 
withynne, þat is to seye, siluer, copre, or tynne, anone hit shal be tournid into a 
margery perle. But ye shal vndrestande þat þees metalles muste be hote in þe 
casting yn but not molte. And he that can make þis fire, withoute any doute he 
shal hele alle holy fire, þe whiche is a infirmite of vengeance as þe fire of Saint 
Anthoyne. And hit wil quenche hit for euer in twynkeling of a eye. And hit 
heleth alle infirmitees corrosife woundrefully. And ye shal vndrestande þat many 
oon callen þis thing sal amarum, i. bittre salte, in þayre boke, þough þay techen 
|P_200 
not þe maistry there-of. 
 
[}Here is cunnyng and crafte of þe maistrie and of the wirching of the

God the maker of alle priuetees hath wrought and made so many mervailles 
in nature that man is vndrestanding with noo tunge ner reason may playnely shewe 
or teche þe grete [\f. 31v\] pryuetees and woundres of God is werkes. 
 
And here I shal shewe to the a watre of grete priuyte and of woundre kinde. 
And here is þe maistrie and þe wirking þere-of. Take þe beste white tartre 
calcyned þat may be made and put hit in a erthen vaisshel wel y-glasid or in a 
vaisshel of glas, and put þer-to þe beste watre ardent þat þou may haue and 
medle þaym togedre. And þenne sette a lembike abouue and distille hit and þou 
shal haue ful fieuble watre ardent, for þe might and þe strengthe þer-of is goon and 
lefte in þe tartre. Put hit aweye, for hit is ful litel worth but to waisshe eyen or 
oþer lymes. Thenne take þy tartre and asaye hit on þy tunge and þou shal finde 
hit double so strong at euery tyme þenne hit was bifore. Þenne put þer-to an other 
|P_201 
watre ardent and distille hit as ye dide bifore; and so do ofte tymes. And at 
euery tyme the tartre shal be strenger, þat mervaille hit is to seye. And þou may 
make hym so strong þat noo thinge may be like hym ner haue comparison þer-to. 
An[{d{] comunely atte euery tyme of þy distillacion afore seide þou shalt finde thy 
vaisshel y-broke. And þerefore hit is necessary þou haue many vaisshels in 
wirching of this maistrie. And yf þou wilte make hit more strenger þenne hit is by 
an hunthrid-folde, grynde hit smal and put hit on a marble stone and sette hit in a 
colde celer, þat hit may tourne into watre. Put hit in a strong glasyn vaisshel, i. a 
doublet of glas, and put þer-to sal armonyak and close hit faste. And soudaynely 
withoute tarieng or elles þe vertue and þe strengthe shal fle oute anone. 
 
The strengthe of watre is this: Yn twynkeling of a eye he shal heele alle 
woundz that been sauable, that been of hurting, or of scabbe; and hit heleth alle 
scabbes þat been in þe skynne and freting awey of þe skynne. And alle thees been 
doon as who seyeth soudaynely. But hit is not needeful in cure of helyng of 
scabbes or woundes to putte armonyak and [\f. 32r\] medle hit with watre of tartre. 
 
And yf þou wilt increche his might at the vttremest, put þere-yn ignem 
adeptum, i. ful able fire, þe whiche was declarid in þe laste chapitre bifore, and hit 
shal be fervent in wirching as hit were fire of helle.

And yf þou wilt put mercury sublymed withynne þe pure watre of tartre 
warme hote, withoute any armonyak þere-ynne or any oþer thing medled þerwith, 
hit shal quenche hit ayen, and hit shal bringe alle bodily calces into a body, and hit 
wirketh many mervailles. And yf hit happe þat this fire þat is shewed in þe 
chapitre afore seyde laste þorough breking of þe vaisshel falle in þe askes abrode, 
gadre hit ayen. For þou shal finde hit bake and harde pastid togedre. And put hit 
on a marble stone, as þou did bifore, and hit shal tourne to watre and be of muche 
vertue and valour as hit was bifore. Preserue this pryuite for hit is ful precious. 
 
[}Yf þou wilte lerne cunnyng and mastrie to departe gold fro siluer 
whenne thay been medled togedre.}] 
There been many manier workz in the whiche gold and siluer been medled 
togedre, as ye may see in gilting of vaisshel and joyeaulx of bisshops and other 
noble persones. And whenne þou wilte departe þat oon fro þat other, lymel hit and 
caste hit in watre corrosife made of vitriol and salt petre. And þere þe siluer 
shal dissolue into watre, but þe gold shal not dissolue ner may not be dissolued yn 
þat watre. Now has þou þy golde departid fro þe siluer. 
 
|P_203 
And yf þou desire to bringe gold into watre, put yn þy watre bifore seyde sal 
armonyak. And þanne þat watre withoute any doute shal dissolue þy golde into 
watre. And þis crafte is ful profitable in savyng of gold in gilte harnoys. Wirke in 
þis maniere and þou shal knowe þe trouthe. 
 
Haueth me excusid that am pore and simple for I wil shewe no more of the 
high pryuitees of philosophie [\f. 32v\] at this tyme. 
 
Here ye may vndrestande þat holy philosophres seyen thus, þat bettre is 
obedience þenne wede or bodily sustenance, and hereto accordeth holy writte seyng 
in this wise, "Melior est obediencia quam victima." 
 
Wherefore to the Lord God almighty and to alle thy halowes, I me obeye in 
body and soule. And to alle holy churche, and to alle prelatz that haue hit in 
gouuernance, and to alle religious aftre þe forme and statute of oure ordre, 
beseching thaym of spiritual leue and licence and þat I bee not repugned, for I 
purpose yn the ii boke here folowyng to shewe and entre high medicines and 
wondreful, þe whiche been desired of many worldly peuple and as who seyeth 
helith and cureth thaire bodies miraculously and wondrefully putteth awey alle 
wicked infermitees. 
 
Also in high deed of charite and helping of man I shal shewe and teche here 
|P_204 
aftre how alle inparfit metalles mowe be changed and transfourmid and brought 
into fyne gold and siluer in a momente, of the whiche þe trouthe and verite was 
shewed to me as God wolde - in grete tribulacion and anguesshe of prisonement. 
And aftre myn vndrestonding and as I haue conceipued, I shal shewe here after, 
but not at þis tyme. For hit longeth not to vs religious nere hit is not laweful þat 
we medel with alkymys werkes. Therefore here I make an ende of the 
Consideracion of Quynte Essence, not withstanding the operacions and 
consideracions of alkyme shuld be shewed and medelid þerewith. 
 
For I take God to witnesse and alle holy lyuers, þat alle þe crafte of alkyme 
shal be to þe contrary and reprovous yf þe deueil haue interesse in the, þat is to 
seye, yf thy purpoos or thyn intent be sette to wirke to distruction or hynderyng of 
any creature. And knowe wel þat this [\f. 33r\] is a crafte of greet peril and 
hindering and fordoing of many a man, in so muche þat noo philosophre wrote 
in this boke the vray trouthe and uerite, but shewed and feyned hit vndre 
paraboles, þe whiche may not be comprehendid and shewid by man is reason. And 
þere is noo man þat may cumne to þe high pryuetees of þe crafte and cunnyng of 
alkym but yf hit be by þe contemplacion and holynesse and special grace of God. 
But and his mynde be deificatife and halowid, he shal with grace not oonely knowe 
|P_205 
al þe maniere of metalles ynwarde, but he shal translate and transforme þe nature 
of thaym. And þat is knowe but to ful fewe men. But ofte tymes thay that vsen 
this crafte draue thaym to making of fals metallz as tho þat wirke by cicroun and 
sophisticacoun, as thees gilters of copre and laton withoute, and blaunching and 
siluering bras and other withoute, and gilding of horne and suyche other. And þer-of 
maken fals monaye and contrefaiten vnlaweful coygne and seales of prelatz and 
princes and been vagabundz and rennen aboute þe cuntre and deceipuen the peuple 
and been withoute and laweful gouuernance and bringen þaymsilf to dampnable 
ende of whom Saint Paule seyeth in þe ii=de= Boke ad Thimotheun capitulo iij, 
Semper sunt discentes et numquam ad scienciam v[{e{]r[{i{]tatis peruenirentes. 
For whenne thay mowen not come to þe parfit cunnyng, þenne þay tournen to fals 
sophisticacions and vnprofitable deceiptes. Suche men comme gladly to an ille 
ende. Other high werkes and mervaillous there bee with þees, the whiche been 
kepte seure and cloos ayenst þe right wisenes of God, as þe day of dome sheweth 
|P_206 
by high dyuynes as I haue lernyd by heuenely cunnyng and shewing of glorieuse 
doctrine. 
 
Here aftre yf God wil I shal shewe to you holy lyuers yn [\f. 33v\] alle 
thees bokes folowyng. And in thaym write your intent by þe grace of God, the 
whiche is callid "Þe Consideracion of Quynte Essence" to the glorie and praising 
of Almighty God and oure Lord Ihesus Crist and his modre glorieuse mayde 
and Marie, and to þ'appostellz Petre and Paule, and of oure Holy Fadre Saint 
Frannceys, and to cumfortyng and consolacion of alle holy lyuers, and to the 
worship and praising of alle holy churche. 
 
Amen. Quod Rogier Bacon.
