|P_60
[\f. 195r\] [}The fyrst chapiter is of þe stoppyng of her blode þat they shuld haue in her 
purgacions & be purged off.}] 
 
Withholdyng of this blode that þei mowe no3t haue her purgacions 
in due tymes comyn in diuerse maners and of diuerse 
enchesons: as of hete ether of colde of þe moder; other of hete 
oþer of colde of þe humours þat be enclosed withynforth in þe 
moder; other of gret drynesse of her complexion, other of moche 
wakyng, oþer of moche thenkyng, oþer of gret angre, oþer of 
moche sorowe, oþer of moche fastyng. Signes & tokenes generall 
|P_62 
of this syknesse ben these: ache & dolour with greuaunces 
and hevynesses from þe navel dounward to her prevy membre. 
And ache of her raynes & of her riggebone & of her foreheved 
and of þe nekke & of þe eyen & infeccion of þe [\f. 195v\] bries, that 
is to say, chaungyng of her colour into another colour than they 
schuld haue. Also heuynesse aboute þe mouthe of her stomak 
and ache aboute þe schulder blades bothe before & behynde, & 
hevynesse of theire thyes & her hyppes & of her hondes & of her 
legges. And they haue otherwhiles an vnskilfull appetyte 
to metes þat ben nought accordyng to hem as to eten coles or 
ryndes or shelles, and her face is evyle ycoloured and oþerwhiles 
þer wexeth wannesse in her visage. And oþerwhile in þis tyme 
they haue wille to companye with men & so þei done and 
bryngen forth chyldren that ben meselles or haue some oþer 
suche foule syknesse. And longe withholdyng of þis blode 
makith women otherwhiles to fallen in to a dropesye & oþerwhiles 
makith hem to haue þe emerawde3; otherwhiles it grevith 
the hert & þe longes and makith hem to haue þe cardiacle. And 
oþerwhiles it affrayeth þe hert so moche that it makith 
hem to fallen downe aswowe as though they hadden þe falling evel. 
And thei liggen in þat syknesse a day or two as though thei wer 
dede. And oþerwhiles they haue þe scotamie with grete stoneyng 
in the brayne & wenen þat all thyng tornyth vp so downe. 
And yf this withholdyng be for the sykenesse of þe blode in þe 
moder - þat þe blode may not flowe in due tymes, as it schuld – 
her vryne wyl be otherwhiles rede as blode. And in tyme þat she shuld 
schewen & in tyme þat she schuld haue her purgacion it 
wil be dark & the veynes wil be ful of blode & þe colours of her 
bries, id est, of her chaunginges, than wil be of clere rede. 
 
But yf this withholdyng be of another humour that is hote and 
drye and is [\f. 196r\] cleped colre, than they felen brennyng & 
prykkyng of hete withynforth & her vryne is of an highe coloure 
& fattye & in tyme of her purgacion a thre dayes or foure that 
they be delyuered, whan they go to prevy, of a colryk mater that 
is, as it were, a bronde & her bries ben of swart rede coloure. And 
yf þis witholdyng be of colde & a moyst humour that is cleped 
flewme the vryne is fatte & discolored, and in tyme of her 
purgacion, whan they gone to prevy, they be diliuered of a 
fleumatike mater that is whi3t and thykke & her bries ben of feble 
|P_64 
colour & smellyth somewhat. But yf withholdyng be of a colde, 
drye humour that is in her veynes & is cleped melancolye they 
fele moche hevynesse benetheforth, & her vryn is discoloured & 
thynne & hathe in hym small gravell otherwhiles of þe colour, as it 
were, axen and otherwhile the vryn is blak & fatt & theryn be 
litel blake motes & derke. And in tyme of her purgacion, yf they 
delyuer hem of ony thyng, it is but litell in quantyte. And women 
that ben ystopped contynuelly her vryne is medled with litell 
small thynges as blak as coles; otherwhiles, it is whyt & thykke & 
derk as mylk; otherwhiles, it is whyt & thynne and whi3t 
swamous mater hangyng in þe vryne; other[{whiles{] small 
bodyes blak ymedled with þe vryne. 
 
Ther ben corupte humours in þe moder with outen the veynes in 
the holownesse of þe moder & they letten women of her purgacions. 
And thre humours ther ben that ben wonte to be in þe 
moder as fleume, colre, & melancolye. The tokens of fleume be 
these: they fele moche moystnesse & they haue no lykyng to 
medle with men. And they fele hevynesse & cold [\f. 196v\] from 
the navell dounward and whan thei haue her purgacion thei ben 
deliuered of moche flewme with þe blode þat þei ben ypurged of. 
And her vryne is whyt or moche drawyng to whyt. And yf suche 
humours ben resolued into wynd, þei fle vp to þe hert & to þe 
longes & make þe woman fle into a cardiacle. But yf þer be moche 
melancolie in þe moder, þei haue litell likyng to medle with men 
& whan þei do so þer passith litell mater from hem & they felen 
moche colde & hevynesse bynethe her navel. And they felen, as 
it wer, a colde wynde mevyng in þe moder & in þe tyme of her 
purgacion they ben deliuered of lytell matere and that is medled 
with melancolye that is of swart yelowe colour, and þe mouthe of 
the marice, that is to say, herr prevy membre, is astonyed and 
hathe but litell felyng ne but litell likyng thawgh they medle with 
men. And her vryne is otherwhiles swart yelowe & fatty & 
otherwhiles it is [{thynne{] & of feble colour. And yf ther be 
moche colre in þe moder, they fele hete þerin & ache & prykkyng 
& hardenesse. And they be hoot about þe mouth of þe marice 
and haven gret desyre & lykyng to company with men & sone 
they deliuere hem of mater but þe mater is but litell in quantite. 
And in tyme of her purgacion, yf they be deliuered of ony blood, 
it ne is but litell & of a rede swart colour. 
 
|P_66 
Cura: For to helpe women of these sekenesses ther be many 
diuerse medecynes as blode letyng in other places to deliuere 
hem of blode that they mowe nought ben yporged of & that is 
profitable lest they falle into a cardiacle oþer into a dropsye. And 
profitable bledynges ben att þe vyenes of þe gret toon & to be 
[\f. 197r\] ygarsed on þe leggis bynethe the sparlyuer bothe byfore & 
behynd, and to be cupped bynethe þe tetes, & also bynethe þe 
reynes behynde. Also Stuphes ben profitable to hem ymade of 
herbes þat wyl & mowe open þe veynes of þe moder þat þe 
bloode may haue the rather his issue. And yf þei be stopped 
thorough colre, that is to say, thorough an humour that is hote & 
drye, late make a stewe of herbes þat ben openyng, as of pollipodie, 
lorell leves, ivy, savyn, madir, origanum, rosemarie, 
comyn, affodille, fenel, mogwede, calamynt, isop, puliole, nept 
& suche oþer, & lete hir sitte on an holowe stole ouer þese herbis 
whan they ben wel ysoden & hote. And sythen let hyr drynk a 
draw3t of wyne þat mogwede & polipodie ben soden yn & 
otherwhiles lete make hyr right sorye & oþerwhiles ri3t wrothe & 
oþerwhiles ry3t mery & late hyr vsen hote saucis and kene as 
garlyk & peper & mustard & kersis & suche other & lete bathe 
hyre in þe bathys ymade of suche herbis as yspake of ri3t now3. 
And lete hyre walke moche & trauayle wel & ete wele & drynk 
well, & then they schull li3tly be purged of hyr blood. And 
aboute þat tyme of þe mone þat þey schul haue her purgacion, yf 
they haue noon, lete hem blede a good quantite of blode at her 
gret too & another day her other gret too. And euerich weke, 
onys, lete hyre vsen to ben ybathed in suche herbes as I spake of 
rather, & sche may be holpen though hyr syknes haue dured hir 
longe tyme. But yf this greuaunce be of cold, first yeve her this 
medecyne to make the mater that grevith her þe more able to 
passe ly3tly awey from hyre. 
 
Take radyche of fenell, [\f. 197v\] parcely, dawk and merche, the 
rotes of these & nou3t þe leves, & then take the leves of mogwede, 
of savyne, of calament, of origanum - yef thou hast nouht 
alle these herbes, take tho that þou mayst come to - & sethe hem 
in vyneger for to they be wel ysoden; & then clense hit & caste to 
the vynegre halfe so moche honye as the vynegre is & lete hem 
two boyle togeder a whyle ouer the fyre, & sithen, whan it is 
colde, lete hir vsen therof a two dayes or thre but medle it with 
water that radices and madir ben sothen yn. 
 
|P_68 
And after that, lete stue here and bathen hyr with suche herbes 
as I sayd rather & after þat this is sodden, lete hyr drynk a drau3t 
of wyne that savyne other mogwode other madir is soden yn & 
medle that wyne with water that polipodie is soden in. And yf 
they haue no purgacion, lete hem blede a good quantite of blode 
as I sayd afore. Suppositories ben couenable medecynes for 
these sykenesses. And they schul be putte in womens prevy 
membres as men putteth suppositories into a mannes fundement 
for to purgen his wombe. But these suppositories that ben 
ordeyned for women schuld be bounde with a threde abouten 
oon of her thyes lest they were drawe all into þe moder. And it is 
profitable to vsen suche suppositories a foure dayes other a fyve 
before that tyme of þe moneth that they schull haue her purgacion 
& they mowe the li3tlyer ben ypurged. On suppositorie is 
this: Take triacle diatesseron +Q sem. and of cocle floure as moche 
& as moche of mirre, & stampe hem togeder with boles galle þat 
savyn or rewe is rotened withyn; then make hit vp with cotton & 
therof make a suppositorie as gret as thy litell fynger and putte 
in her prevy membre [\f. 198r\]. But anoynte it first with clene 
hony and oyle togeder and strewe þeron pouder of skamony, & 
put in þe prevy membre; thus my3t a man do with the rote of 
lupines & that is moche better. Another supposytorye: Take the 
rote of smallache - the mountance of thy fynger - all grene, & 
larde hit with the rote of pileter of Spayne & sithen putt that rote 
in þe erth ayen a fourtenyght or a thre wekys and than take it vp 
and wipe hit clene and putte it into her prevy membre all day and 
all a nyght; and afterward take it owt and anoynte it with oyle of 
lorer oþer with mete oile & putt it in eftsones, and lete it ligge till 
sche haue here purgacion. For though ther were a dede chylde in 
her wombe it wolde brynge it ou3t. And þe same virtue hathe the 
rote of actory & also best is the rotis of vyns yf it be di3t in the 
same wyse. But or than sche vnderfonge this suppositorie, thou 
schalt sethe savyne & fursis, pulioll riall, lorer leues in water & 
lete þe woman sitte þerin a good whyle afterward and sithen lete 
her wasshe hir prevy membre as depe as sche may reche inward 
& thus do a good whyle with water; then do drye her with a 
clothe & putt in þat suppositorie of apium or of acorns vt supra. 
 
|P_70 
Another suppositorie: Take þe floure of cokell and medle hit 
with hony & with coton & make a suppositorie therof. 
 
Anoþer is this: Take peleter of Spayne +Q iii, of litell peleter as 
moche, cokell flour +Q i, of diagredii +Q vii, putte all these into a litell 
lynnen bagge that thy fynger wold in & lete hyr putt it in as depe 
as sche may so þat sche may pullen hit oute li3tlich, for it wyl 
make hyre haue a purgacion anone. Yef her wombe be sore of 
suche suppositories [\f. 198v\], lete anoynte withyn with oyle of 
roses or of violet or with mete oile or with fresshe butter þat is not 
salted. Other medecynes ther ben the whiche yf a woman drynk 
hem they wyl make hyre to haue a purgacion other deliver hir of 
a dede chyld yf þer be ony withyn hire, as bawme precious 
ydronk and þe jus of isop, other of diptayn & of leke & of 
tounkers & þe seed of tounkers ypouderd and ydronken. But 
yf þis siknesse come of angre other of sorowe, lete mak hir mery & 
yeve hyre comfortable metes and drynkes and lete vsyn hyr to 
bathen hyre otherwhiles. And yf it be of moche fastyng oþer of 
moche wakyng, lete diete hyr moche with good metes and 
drynkes that mowe make hyr to haue good blode, & lete hyr 
make hyr mery and glade & leven þe hevinesse of her hevy 
þoughtes.
