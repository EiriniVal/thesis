[^DANIEL, LIBER URICRISIARUM 2^] 
 
|P_193 
[\f. 2\] [}Explicit Prologus in Librum Vricrisiarum. Primum Capitulum}] 
Vryne is as mekyll forto sayne in Anglish as "on in þe reynes": 
reyns Freynsh, renes Latyn, "lendis" in Anglish. Yf þu wilt wetyn 
wytterly whate arne the reynes, se in þe 2 boke, the 4 capitle, de 
albo colore. And vryn is cald "on in the reyns," for ther hit is kendely 
and formyli causid and formyd. And vnderstond that vryne is 
gendrid and made in twey placis of mannis bodi, ferst in the lyuere 
and sethen in þe reynes, but principaly in the reynes. For in the 
lyuer he taketh ferst his body and his substance; his colour he 
takyth when he entrith þe veynis, and kende hete begynnyth forto 
wyrken into the humuris. But in the reyns it is decocte and digestid, 
that is forto seyne, soden and defyid; and ther he takyth his 
fynall forme and his last color; et þerfor hit is called "on in the 
reyns." 
 
Also, it is callid vryn of this woord of Gru vrith, that is a[{s{] 
myche forto seyne as "a demonstracioun, a shewyng." For more 
certeynly and more verreyle vryn shewith and tellith the disposicioun 
of the reynes than of any oþer partys of the body. For when 
|P_194 
we will witten and knowen the state and the disposicioun of manys 
body wythinnin, and namely of þe reyns, we taken counsell and 
red at vryn. Also, vryn is seyde of this Latyn worde vrere, that is to 
seyn "brenyng, as fyre or hote thing dothe," for hit is be wey of 
kende hote and drye. Be reson of his dryehede he is desictatif, þat 
is forto sey, dryend; et because that it is hote and drye, hit is bothe 
indesictatif and vritife, dryend and brennend. Hit hathe in him 
also kyndely a saltyshed, because of whiche [{it is desictatif, vritife, 
and mordyfycatyf, dryend, brennend,{] and bytend, for tho thre 
arn the propretes of salt. 
 
And þerefor vryne is medicinable souereynly to hem that han 
sekenes o the splene, [\f. 2v\] the mylte, and agayne ydropisy and 
ychche and scabbe and pusshis and kyne and agayne alle [{þoz{] 
maladyis that neden desictatiown, yf a clene wollen clowt be well 
dippid and dappid þerin and the place well washen therwith. 
 
Also, as seyth þe comentowre upon Gyl, yf an oynement be 
made of that and of haukys galle, hit fordothe soris and maladyis 
þat onco[{m{]in in mennis 3erdis and wommenis membris. Also, 
men seyth that it fordothe þe web and þe pyn in þe eye. And as 
Gilbert seyth, it fordothe also the web in þe eye that women lachin 
of her childryng. And also, yf spleneticus, id est, he that is seke o the 
splene, drinke his owne fastand water and fastend, it helpith 
|P_195 
myghtily. Wh[{a{]te þe splen is, se in þe 2 booke, þe 7 capitle, de 
karapos. Also, agayn the colde gowte, take white cley or ellis black 
cley and þine owne fastande vryn 7 or 9 daies olde, and that þe cley 
be clene piked, and menge hit togeder in a wollen cloute, clene and 
newe washen. And ley the emplaster as far as þe payne is, and the 
peyn shall abatyn, but not þe maladye. And do this as oftyn as þe 
peyne comyth. Also, a wollen clowte, clene washen and dipped in 
his owne fastend vryne 7 or 9 dayes standyn and wrappid as far as 
the payne gothe, doþe þe same effect. Also, a potell of his owne 
vryne 7 or 9 daies standyn, with halfe a quarte of peytor salt bullid 
into þe myddis, or the thirde part, and enoynted, dothe the same. 
 
[}Quid sit vrina et vnde qualiter fit. 2=m= capitulum}] 
As seyth Gilis in his text an all auctores and commentoures, this 
is discripciown of vryn. Descripcioun of a thing is þe telling whate 
a thing is. [{Vryn is{] a late and a suptyle meltyng and clenesyng of 
bloode and of humuris; et take hede þat I sey "late" for this skyll: 
For sumtyme þe watir passith oute of the body sone after that it is 
dronken, and that owith not forto be called vryn proprely, but it 
owith be called pisse. For whan it is pissid sone, neyþer is hit 
decoct ne digestid in the veynis and in the reyns, ne the colour of 
him is not profowndid, id est, not dept ne dyed as hit shulde ben. 
An all is because that he hathe not his tyme in the body kendely as 
he shulde han. Also, I sey "suptill," for the more that he is decoct 
and digested in the body,þe [\f. 3\] more suptill is he in himsilfe and 
|P_196 
þe better profowndid in colour, as þu maiste sene in þe 2 boke. 
Suptil is as mykell to seyn as "thenne, clere, and bryght." 
 
Item, id est also, I sey "a meltyng, a clensing," of þe blode and of 
þe humuris for þis skyll: For right as þou sest þe whey is wrongyn 
and clensed and pressed oute from the mylke thurgh wyrkyng and 
traualing and threstyng oute of the þikke mater, id est, fro þe cloddis 
and þe clumpris and þe cruddis, right so the vryn is pressed and 
wrongyn and clenesid out fro massa sanguinis, id est, fro þe clod, þe 
clumpre, of the blode. Vnderstond that massa sanguinis is not els but 
a collectiown, id est, a gedering togidre, of the 4 humuris, and that 
is epar, the lyuere, for epar is nothing but sang[{uis{] coagulatus, anglice 
a collectiown of blode cloddid and clumprid and cruddid togedre. 
And through myght and vertue of þe lyuer arn the humuris causid 
and wrought, helpand keynde hete, as þou maiste sene in the nexte 
capitle folowend. And to this forsaid descripcioun of vryn that 
Gilis gevyth acordith well þe diffiniciown þat Ysaac and Theophele 
gyven. Diffinicioun and descripciown arn all one to sayne. 
 
Vryn is a clensyng of þe blode and of all the toþer humuris 
wrought be wey of keynde in manis body. Whiche and hough 
manye and what ben the humuris of man, [{se{] in the 4 capitle. For 
I spake of milke in the fer[{s{]te diffiniciown of vryn, vnderstond 
that in mylke arn 4 thingis - serum, whey, and that is frigidum et 
humidum, colde and moiste; butirum, buttir, and þat is calidum et 
humidum, hote and moiste; caseus, chese, and that is frigidus et siccus, 
|P_197 
colde and drye. The ferthe is tat ilke wete and white substaunce lac, 
milke, and that is frigidum et humidum, colde and moiste. 
 
Item, anoþer similitude, id est, anothir example, of causing and 
gendring of vrin in man puttyn auctores also, for thei callin vrin a 
cribracioun, id est, a sifting, a clensing thurgh a syfe et for this skyll: 
For right as þou sefte that thurgh þe cribre, the syue, is separat and 
diuisid, id est, atwinnid and departid þe smale matere fro þe grete, 
the clene fro the foule, and the couenawnt fro þe oncouenawnt, 
right o the same wyse in þe secunde digestion, id est, in the lyuere, 
is sequestraciown and divisiown of þe fode and of be 4 humuris, 
which sequestraciown and diuisiown is in maner of a sifting in the 
[\f. 3v\] 2 digestiown, that we callen in Latyne epar, the lyuere in 
Anglish. Of this maner of siftyng and of werkyng, se in the folowende 
capitle. 
 
[}Capitulum 3=m=. De generacione vrine}] 
Forto knowyn and wetyn how and in whate wise þe vryn is 
gendrid and made in man, and also how þe fode, scilicet, the mete 
and the drynke þat man is susteynde by, is digestid and difyid in 
man, vnderstond that digestioun is in 3 placis in the body: in þe 
stomak, in þe lyuer, and in all the toþer membris and lyms of man; 
et therfor the stomac is callid þe first digestiown, the lyuer is callid 
the second digestiown, and all the toþer parties of the body arn 
callid the therde digestiown. 
 
The fyrst digestiown, I sey, is in þe stomac, for euery maner 
foode, be hit mete, be hit drink, þat kyndly entrith þe body forto 
norishin it, fyrst it drawith kyndly to þe stomac, and þer hit is 
decoct and digestyd, and thanne the iows of that foode is sewid and 
|P_198 
sokyn and drillith ryght as hit were a maner of drink that we callyn 
"pthysan"; et this dothe epar, þe lyuere, fro whom þe stomac hathe 
his kende hete. Se in the 2 boke, de colore karapos. And all this is 
thurugh werkyng and helpyng of kynde hete. Whan the stomak 
haþe thus done, he drawith and takyth to him, id est, to his kendely 
fode and nurshing, that þat is most like and answeryng to his 
kynde and to his complexiown, and let þe remanawnt passin owt 
away be an hole in his botime, id est, in the neþer ende of þe 
stomac, whiche issu, whiche hole, is callid in phisik porta stomachi, 
anglice mawe-3ate, and for this skyll: For hit is shet til þat nede of 
kende deliueryth þe fode oute of the stomac, and as sone as it is 
oute, hit shettith himselfe ageyn as he was beforne. Galienus in 
libro anathomiarum suarum, in the Boke of [{his{] Anathomyis, kalliþ hit 
portonarium, anglice þe portonarie. 
 
To this portonarie is knet and tyed a tharme þat is kallid duodenum, 
þe duodene, and for þis skyll, for he berith in leynthe 12 
fyngir brede vpon þe proporciown of euery man, woman, or 
childe. And it is of quantite euene with portonarie. Than whan this 
duodene hathe vndirfongid and receyued the foode owte of mawe-yate, 
he taketh thereof that þat nedeth to his kyndely fode. And 
that þat beleuith, þe duodene wringith it and presseth hit, right as 
hit were a pressowr, and delyuerith hit forthe into another rope 
that is knet and teyid to him þat is callid [\f. 4\] ieiunium, the ieiun or 
fastere or faste-gut. 
 
This faste-gut vnderfongith the foode oute fro duodene and þan 
he sowketh and drawith oute all þe iowse and þe moistehede of þe 
|P_199 
fode, right as a magnete ston drawith yrn to hym. And kepith to 
hym that þat fallith for his kende and sendith forthe that ilke iows, 
that humidite, to epar be certeyn veynes that gon fro hym to epar, 
whiche vaynes arn callid meseraice, miseraicis. And this is the skyll 
whi it is callid ieiunium, for whan he hathe sokyn vp all the iows, al 
þe humidite, and sent it, as I seide, to epar, right as it were in 
maner of a swete (for hit hath none issu wher þe iows and þe 
moisture shulde gone oute), hit is, as it were, fastande and voide 
and empty, for it is not sene wher it passyth away. This ieiun is 
rownd and glubbid and boystows, as seyth Ysaac and þe auctor of 
Anathomyis, for this skyll that þe iows and þe moisture may swetyn 
oute be dyuerse smale weyis and poris of him. But duodenum, to 
whom ieiun is teyid, [{i{]s pleyn and smothe, and tat for 4 skyls - 
that þe fode may þe more lyghtly descendyn, id est, gon downe, into 
ieiun; and also that þe place shuld not ben letted, whiche place is 
necessarie to certayne veynes þat diuisin hem ther fro a veyne 
comende fro þe lyuere; also, be enchesoun of smale skynnys and 
buddy flesh þat arn there nere; and also that þe fode may han his 
kyndely dwellyng ther til epar, whan his tyme come, may takyn 
and drawyn fro hym that ilke iows and þat substancial humidite. 
 
Item, þe forseyde ieiun, as sum men seyn, is kallid porta lactis 
or lactea porta, anglice melke-yate, and this is þe philosophie, id est, þis is 
the skill: For, as I seide, al þe iows, al the humidite, swetithe and 
sweltith oute of him into the lyuer, right as þe melk swetith and 
sweltith owte of the kyis body into the vddyr. Item, lactea porta or 
porta lactis is anothir thing, and se in the 2 boke, de liuido colore. 
|P_200 
The forseide meseraicis arn 8 in nowmber. One of hem is knytt 
to þe ouere mowthe of þe stomake, scilicet to þe ouer ende of þe 
stomak, anoþer fast by that ouere ende of þe stomac, and þe 
thirdde of hem is fastind to þe botme of þe stomac. And alle the 
toþer 5 arn knet to ieiun, þat semyth so alwey fastende, as I seide. 
And be þo 5 meseraycis passith þe iows and þe humidite to epar, as I 
seyde, and all þe remenawnt, scilicet þe drestis and þe grownde-sopis 
and the thike materie, þe drit, descendith downe into a gut þat 
is kallid in Latyne saccus ventris, id est, anglice the wombe-sac, for 
therin is all þe relefe of þe mete. 
 
Also it is kallid [\f. 4v\] orbus, id es, rownd, for hit is rownde. Also 
it is kallid monoculus, id est, on-[{e{]yid, for it hathe but one hole, and 
þerfore there þe matere comyth in, ther it muste gone oute. And 
þat may it not but thurgh mordicaciowne, id est, thurgh bytyng and 
freting, of cisti fellis, id est, of the galle, for his myght comith to him 
by certeyne poris. And he bit it and constrayneth that mater and 
cachith it oute, and so it passith into yliones and the smale ropis 
that lewde folke callen the guttes - so into colon, fro colon into longaon, 
and so al owte. Ylion et ylica passio, se in the 2 boke, þe 7 
|P_201 
capitle, de karapos; colon et colica passio, þe 2 boke, de albo colore. 
Longaon is þe laste gutt in þe body, for hit lithe into the taile-ende. 
Summe kallen it þe ars-gutt, the ars-rope; summe the ars-bubbe, 
and sum the inspyn. 
 
Cisti fellis or cista fellis is properly þe huske, þe skyn, of the galle, 
and it is takyn her also oftyntyme bothe for the skyn and for the 
matere that is þerin; et take hede þat though Ysaake sey þat duodenum 
is on and ieiunium, as I seyde nowe beforne, no-for-than þe 
Boke of Anatomys seyth that thei arn bothe one. And þus is the 
wyrkyng of þe ferste digestioun, id est, of the stomac. 
 
Than whan epar hathe vnderfongid þe iows and þe humidite fro 
þe stomac on this wyse, he sendith forthe þe remanawnt abowtyn 
to his veynys forto be soden and bullid in hem. For fro him comyn 
veynus all aboutyn to euery membre and lyme in þe body and to al 
the extremites of the body, as to þe armes, þe leggis, handis and 
feete, fyngris and toos. And in this sendyng aboutyn, epar wyrkith, 
maketh, and gendrith þe blode of þis humidite, and þan he twynnyth 
and diuisith þe clere fro þe thikk and þe clene fro the vnclene, 
and kepith him his foode of the blode. For his kende nvrishing and 
foding is blode, for he is not but blode himself, as I saide in þe 2 
capitle. And in this sendyng forthe all the toþer parties of the body 
taken her kynde and her noreshing. 
 
Cor, þe hert, be reson that he is moste noble membre of beeste, 
for he is grounde and well and spring of kende hete in all þe body 
of man, and þerfor he drawith to him þe most worthi parte of þe 
fode for[{to{] cownfortyn and nurishin him and encresyn his kynde 
|P_202 
hete and deuisin and yevyn and senden hit to all þe membris and 
partes abowtyn [\f. 5\] be all þe body, and namely to þe moste worthi 
places ferst, as to þe brest and to the hede. And þerfor the lyuer and 
þe stomac and all oþer membris in þe body han her kende hete fro 
the hert. And þerfor right as the sonne wirkith in alle creaturis here 
bynethin, right so the hert in man. 
 
But vndirstond that stomachus hathe his kynde hete fro the hert 
not [{immedieate{], id est, not first and principally and be non othir fro 
the hert, but he hathe [{medieate{] fro the hert, id est, secundarie and 
be anoþer, or else be mene of another. For þe hete that þe stomac 
hathe of þe hert, the stomac taketh it of the lyuer, for epar taketh 
hete fro þe hert and yevith to þe stomac. Epar lith vnder þe botme 
of þe stomac, not evyn vndir, but more on þe right halfe, als Galien 
seyth in his Anathomys. And so epar is as a feere to þe stomak, and 
the stomak is to him as a pott or a cawdrown, stondand as holde 
ouere the feere. Thus spekyn auctors and bokis of phisik. Cor in þe 
2 boke, de karopos. 
 
Thene pulmo, þe lunge, and all the toþer spirituall membris 
drawyn to hem her and nurshin and foodyn thoo membris and tho 
placis that ben vpward as her partis, and þe throte and þe nek and 
þe hede and his partys, with þo partyis of þe foode þat bleuith hem. 
|P_203 
Pulmo and spirituall membris, the 2 boke, de liuido colore. Whan 
pulmo takith his part, he taketh also and drawith to hym kendely 
þat mater of the fode that is moste answeryng to flewme. And þere, 
[{scilicet{] in the lungis, and of that matere is flewme cawsed and 
gendrid. Then fell, þe galle, takith to him his part and therwith 
matere that answerith moste to colour and turnyth hit into colre. 
And splene, the mylt, taketh his and gendrith malancolye. But epar 
takyth to him the matere of blode and mundyfieth hym and clenseth 
hym, as Y saide. And þus and on this wyse and in this placis 
[{and{] membres, arn the 4 humuris causid and gendrid. What arn 
the 4 humuris, in the 4 capitle. 
 
And when epar hath mundifyid and purgid and clensed þe 
matere of þe blode, than the wete matere, þe moyste substawnce, id 
est, the vrine, whiche vrine, as I seyde, is a clensyng fro þe blode 
and fro þe humuris, hit passith forthe, berend wyth hym of þe 
blode and of þe rudihed of the [\f. 5v\] blode into the reynes be 
certeyn veynes þat arn callid vene capillares, id est, anglice hed-heer 
veynis, for þei arn as smale as hed-heer, for þei mown onnethes be 
seyn wyth eye for smallehed. And thei arn knyt to þe bak and to þe 
rigbon aboutin þe myddis of þe rigbon within the body, that it 
berth with him of the blode and of þe rudihed hit is forto nurshyn 
with the reyns. 
 
And þan whan epar hathe o this wise purgid and clenesid þe 
thike fro þe thynne and the clene fro þe vnclene and also after þat 
|P_204 
he hath sent aboutyn to euery party þat that longi[{t{]h to hym, 
thanne þat that bleuith is kallid and is purus sanguis or humor sangui[{ni{]s, 
anglice fyne blode or ellis þe humur of þe blode, þat arn al 
on to sayne. Item, whan pulmo hathe takyn to hym, as I saide, 
that þat is moste answer[{en{]de to hym, þe remenaunt that bleuith is 
pure flewme. Item, whan fel is, þe remanawnt [{is pure color; and 
splen is, þe remanawnt{] is pur melancolye and blak color. Blak 
color and melancoly arn all on. 
 
Than whan al þes poyntis arn þus done, þe superfluites of þe 
fode, id est, the refuse, þe owtcastis, and þe beleuinggis of all, arn 
sent owt abowtyn be th' poris of þe skyn and be othir issuis of þe 
body, as be the eyne with gownde and bler-eyidhed, be þe eeris 
with gownde and sappe, be þe nasethrillis thorough felthe, be þe 
mowthe thurgh spitting, and be þe poris of the hede thrugh fumosites 
and swetyng; et o this wyse euery membre taketh of þe fode that 
tat is him like, clene clennes[{se{] and fowle fowlness. 
 
Then when þe vrin comith to þe reynes be venas capillares, as I 
saide, there he dwellyth till he is kyndely bullid and decoct and 
diffyid, and þere he taketh his kynde and his finall color, al be it so 
þat he toke his body, his substancialhed, befornhande in epate. And 
þerfor seyn all auctores þat vrin taketh his substaunce in epate, in þe 
|P_205 
lyuere, but his forme, [{id est, color{], he taketh in þe reyns; et than 
whanne he is decoct and digestid as he shall ben, the reyns senden 
it forthe be 2 smale veynes to þe vesye, id est, to þe bladder. And at 
his tyme passith oute by þe yerde. Thiese 2 smale passing placis be 
whiche þe vrin passith fro þe reyns into þe visye arn cald vrithides or 
els vrithides pori. 
 
The 3 digestioun, as I seid, is in all [\f. 6\] the toþer membrys of 
[{the{] body. For there kynde digestith into fleshe, into senewe, into 
bon. And the residue, [{id est,{] þe remenawnt, of the fode and also 
þe residue of þe 4 humuris beleuande still in the membris is callid 
tercia superfluitas or superfluitas tercie digestionis, anglice the thirde 
superfluite or else þe superfluite of þe 3 digestioun. Whiche 
superfluite, yf hit be so þat kynde be stronge and myghti and þe 
membris of þe body also, thei showuyn and delyuer hit out be þe 
poris and þe issuis of þe hyde, if hit be kyndely moyst be swet; if it 
be kyndely drye, be diuerse fumosites, as I seyde while-er. Fumosite, 
in anglice smokyshhed and smotherhede. And vnderstond þat 
of fumosites in þe body is causid her and ruggidhed, as we seen in 
tres, that þrough kynde hete þei puttyn and cachchyn owt her 
superfluites, and therof comyn here rynde and her barke and her 
mos. 
|P_206 
But yf [{the membres{] be not sufficient ne of powere to driuen 
and cachchin owt þe superfluites be the poris, then kynd ledith 
hem ageyn to epar be þe same veynis be whiche blod cam to tho 
membres, and þan epar sendith [{forþ{] þo superfluites to þe reyns 
with clensinggis of þe blode, and kynde delyuereth hem forth oute 
with þe vrin, and that is proprely ypostasis in þe vryn. For ypostasis 
in vryn is noþing but superfluite of þe 3 digestiowne. And therfor 
seyth Galien þat vrin of heyl folk, whan hit hath stondon and 
rested, hit hathe but a litel ypostasis or non, and þe philosophie is 
for þe kynde is myghty in hymselfe and puttith oute þe superfluites 
be the poris of þe body; & therfore whan ypostasis shewyth him in þe 
vryn, hit tellyþ howe mekyll kynde and þe humuris wyrkyn in þe 3 
digestioun. 
 
Item, þe lequor of þe vryn, id est, þe selue vryn, tellyth and 
shewyth þe wyrkyng of kynde in þe 2 digestiown and also how þe 
humuris are decoct and digested in the veynis. Item, þe superfluite 
of þe firste digestioun, [{scilicet{] that þat gothe oute at þe taill-ende, 
showith the wirkyng of kynde in þe first digestiown an also how þe 
fode is decoct and digestid in the first digestiown. Ipostasis in þe 2 
bok, þe 2 [{capitulo, de nigro colore{]; et capitulo de pallido colore; and in þe 
3 bok, þe last capitle. 
 
Vndirstond that euery of the 3 digestiowns whiche Y haue seide 
of hathe his owne propre purgaciown forto purgyn and clensyn 
himsylfe fro his superfluites. The first digestiown hath purgacioun 
to his superfluites [\f. 6v\] the ouere and the neþer hole, [{scilicet{] þe 
mowthe and the tayle-ende: þe mouþe be golpyng and rosping and 
|P_207 
brakyng; the tail-ende be egestiown - [{id est,{] shityng, crakkyng, 
and wlisping benethin - is purging proprely of þe guttis and þe 
ropis. The 2 digestiown hathe vryn-makyng, and þe 3 digestion 
hathe ypostasy and swetyng be þe poris and þe issuis of the hide. 
 
Than yf hit be so þat þe kynde of þe membris and of þe lymmes 
be vnmyghty forto leden and bryngyn ageyn the forsaide 
superfluites of þe fode to epar, than for as mekyll as they mow not 
haue her kynde cowrs agayne to epar, þey beleuyn still closid and 
sperid in the membres or ellis in þe blode of þe veynis or ellis in 
bothin. And þen is this superfluite calld cruditas humorum, anglice þe 
rawhed of humuris or ells rawe humuris, and for this skyll: For the 
membris not parfitly sethin ne digestin þe fode ne turnin it not into 
here substawnce and into her kende as thei shulden don, or ells for 
als mykill as þo fodis or þat fode is not necessarie ne notefull ne 
couenawnt to þe membris, or ells becawse þat þe stomac and the 
lyuere not defyen hem parfitly. For but if þe fode be parfitly decoct 
and digestid in þe stomac and in þe lyuere, hit is inpossible to ben 
kyndely digested in þe toþer membris of þe body or forto be turnid 
into her substawnce and her kynde. For ells the membris vnderfongin 
hit not, but kyndely refusyn it and mown it not, no more 
þen a seke man þat yernith after fode and nought may browkyn it. 
 
Verbi gratia, I se be example: whan stomachus, þe stomake, hathe 
receyued þe fode and wrought into þe fode as his kynde and myght 
and power is, so he digestith for þe tyme, and þan whan it passith 
oute of the stomac not parfitly digested and wolde comyn into þe 
|P_208 
lyuere, there may he not han his kynde dwellyng, ne re[{ceyuyn{] 
his kynde decoctioun and digestiown, ne han his kynde chawnging 
and turnyng into parfit b[{l{]ode, be reson that he had not first his 
kynde decocciown and digestioun in þe stomac as he shulde han 
hadde. And so it beleuyth still in þe membris and in þe veynes and 
in þo parties Y seyde aforne, clere and rodye as rose and crudus et 
indigestus, rawe and vndefyid. And þan yf it be so that the veynis 
and þo placis ben myghti and stronge and vertuowse in kynde, þen 
þei cachchin and dryuin it oute be þe poris and oþer issuis of the 
body. And ells it beleuyth still þere, as I seide, shet an closid in þo 
membres or in þo veynis or ells in bothin. And þen it turnith [\f. 7\] 
into matere [{of{] corrupcioun, whiche is cause of diuerse sekenesses 
and maladyis and passiowns in man, and þat vpon þe kynde and 
the complexiown of the fode. 
 
For cibus calidus et humidus, fode þat is kyndely hote and moyst, 
cawsith sekenes of blode; frigidus et humidus, cold and moiste, 
fleumatik; frigidus et siccus, colde and drye, melancolik; calidus et 
siccus, hot and drye, colrik. Than yf siche materes makyn dwellyng 
in þe body, and wykked eyr or grevawnce or colde takyng or 
myskepyng or swyche oþer poyntis comyn, tho helpin and comfortyn 
and strenghin þo wikkid humuris, and tha[{n{] are þay more 
feruent and more parilous. And þan þey flowyn aboutyn in þe 
body and in the veynis, and so they arn cawse and matere of 
dyuerse febris and sekenessis. Iff hit be so þat they turnin not into 
matere of diuerse febris, than þei hetin and chawfyn þe skyn and þe 
poris, and thanne is þe blod enchawfed thurgh hem, and that 
|P_209 
enchawfyng of blode causith a febre ethik. Febre etik, in þe 2 bok, 
de liuido colore. 
 
If it be so that sum of þat mater passe to oþer membris and 
placis in þe bodi, thanne vpon his kynde and his qualites hit gendirth 
in þo membris and placis diuers maladyis and sekenessis of 
soris and of apostemis. If hit be so that þat mater be comfortid and 
streynthed, and hit be of myght forto showyn and puttyn owte 
hymself be the porys, and þan myght of þe skyn faill, than that 
mater beleuyth still sperid and closid vnder the hide, and þerof 
comyn corrupciowns and soris, [{as{] yche and pussys and scabbis 
and þe morphe and suche other. If it be so þat þe mater heyde 
himselfe in þe fleshe, þan he causeth and gendreth carbunculos, 
vlcera, antraces, scrophulas, et cancros and swyche oþere. Carbunculus is 
a sore that in þe begynyng and in þe growyng rede as a charbuncle 
ston and aftirward, whan it is rype, it is blak as a quenched cole, 
and because of þe redehede, hit berith þe name of a carbuncle. 
Vlcus is a bile and also a boch; antrax, a felown; scrophula is a sore þat 
is like a swynis wrotyng; cancer, the cankir. Nere-hande all þat I 
haue seide in þis capitle Ysaake techith nygh worde for worde.
