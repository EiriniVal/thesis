Greet hete in þe body þei make. 
And þat hete þat is wiþynne 
Makeþ the body as it shulde brenne; 
And þat body þat is so hoot 
Casteþ out anoon þe swoot.

But ouermiche hete dere it shal.'

Strong children as olde men do?' 
[\f. 165v\] 'Children þat ben smale and 3ing 
Þat beeþ not icome to wexing, 
Þei ben 3it feble of nature 
To make any engendrure: 
Her seed is 3it to grene þerto 
And þerfore may it no good do; 
And the passage in the body 
Þere þat þe nature shal passe by 
Is to streite, wherfore þe kinde 
No kindely issew may it finde. 
And if þat þei any children gete, 
Þei shal neuere be strong ne grete 
For it falliþ in eueryþing, 
Feble seed, feble al þe spring - 
And not so of men allone 
But of beestis euerychone.'

In what cuntre shal he dwelle?' 
'With his moder while he is 3ing 
Shal be al his dwelling. 
Into Egipt she him lede shal

And openly hem forto teche;

Euere til he deie and breke helle.'
