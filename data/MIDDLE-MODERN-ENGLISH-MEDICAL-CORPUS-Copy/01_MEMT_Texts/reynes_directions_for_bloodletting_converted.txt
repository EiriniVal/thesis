Ysodor seyth be auctoryte of Ypocras þat þer 
arn iii dayes þat no man owyth to be lete blood. Þat 
is for 'to' seyn, the vii day of þe [{calende{] of Apryl, 
the fyrst day of August and the last day of Decembyr 
etc. 
 
Her may a man knowyn in what monyth and what 
houre of þe day is best bledyng for dyuers complexiouns. 
In Marche, Apryl and May reynyth blood, and he arn hote 
and moyst. In the monyth of Iune, Iule and August 
reynyth red colour, and it arn note and drye. [\f. 12r\] In 
the monyth of Septembyr, Octobyr and Nouembyr reynyth 
|P_158 
blak colour, and it arn drye and colde. In þe monyth 
of Decembyr, Ianuar and Ffeuer3er reynyth fleume, and 
he arn colde and moyste. Sanguine men and fleumatyk 
men owyn to bledyn abowtyn vndern, þat they ben fastyng, 
and coleryk men fro an our afor vndern tyl noonn. 
And a malecolyous man owyth to bledyn abowtyn noun. 
But no3t aftyr mete, ne aftyr slepe, ne aftyr hatyng, 
for thanne arn þe [{humores{] medelyd þe goode with the 
wykke, and if he blede, than þe goode [{humores{] schuldyn 
goon owte as well as þe wyk. 
 
It is to wetyn þat xxvii dayes <ben> beforn 
euery prime tyl the chaungyng of the mone. And þu 
þat wylt be letyn blood, take hed to þe nest prime and 
aftyrward begynne to counte in þe day of the chounge 
of the mone aftrn. Þat prime qwon many dayes ben into 
þe day, þu wylt be letyn blood. And sythyn, loke in 
what monyt it be, and in the space of that monyth goo 
alweys vpward tyl þu come euene a3en the noumbyr of 
þe forseyd day. And loke be ony maner þat þu blede 
not3 ne ony medesyn 3eue to þat membyr wyche þat 
syngne gouernyth as long as it lestyth. 
|P_159 
Alle þe veynys of the hed schuldyn bledyn aftyr 
mete, owte take þe veyn vndyr the chyn. And all the 
veynys of the armys schuldyn bledyn afor mete fastyng. 
And alle þe veynys of the handis and thyes and feet, aftyr 
mete. The veyne in the front is good for gret hedwerk, 
and for the emygrayn, and for þe fallyng euyl, and for þe 
frentyk, and for the brayn þat is apeyred. and for þe 
lepre þat is newe come. 
 
[\f. 12v\] Her may men knowyn and sen that for fawte 'and 
neglygens' of blood-latyng, men and women takyn dyuers 
sekenenes, þat is for to sayn, perlyows feuers, palseyes, 
sores, mychell bledyng at þe nose, sotheyn deth, pestelens, 
lepre and many moo sekenesses. 
 
And [{of{] often blood-latyng but 3yff a man 
nedyth, comyth ofte wekednesse and febyllnesse of complexion, 
and febylnesse of the stomak, and of the herte, 
of lever, and of the lounge, and of alle his body. But 
3yf blood-lat be vsyd whan nede is and tyme is, it 
amendyth the heryng, and kepyth wattery eyn, and purgyth 
the stomak, and doot awey gret hevynesse and 
norschyth the good blood, and dystroyt3 þe wykkyd 
blood, and lengyth þe lyff. And of onwys blood-lath 
|P_160 
comyth many sekenesse, and oftentyme deyn men. 
 
But wete þu well þat blood-lath kepyth mekyll 
in serteyn tymes of the yeer for certeyn complexion 
and lengyth þe lyff. Þat is for to seyn, in the ende 
of May is blood-lath good for hem that han plenty of 
blood, and in the ende of August for plenty of coler, 
and in the ende of Nouembr for meche malecolye, and 
in the ende of Feuer3er for mekyll flemme. But euer 
loke þat the dayes and the reulys of blood-latyng be 
kepte. And euer 3yff nede be to letyn blood, do it, 
saue kepe þe rewlys and the dayes. But in a continuall 
agu, let no blood aftyr the iiii=te= day and alle the 
dayes wythinne the fourte day. 
 
He þat schuldyn letyn man or woman blood, hym 
must ben avysyd of iiii poyntes. Þat is for to seyn, 
þat tyme be good and able, and not to ouer-hote, ne 
to ouer-colde, ne not in the hundyn dayes, ne on other 
dayes þat arn forbeden. 
 
[\f. 13r\] The secunde poynte is custum. 3yf a man be 
custumable for to blede, or if an elde man haue a sekenesse 
þat hath nought vsyd to bledyn, and the sekenesse 
|P_161 
may not3 awey withowtyn blood-lath, it is dred to letyn 
hym blood for custum and febylnesse. 
 
The thredde poynt is age. Þat is for to seyn, 
a chylde of xii yeer owyn not to blede, ne man fer in 
age. 
 
The fourte poynte is þis: if a man be stronge 
and of gret herte for to bleden, aftyr þat he may: a 
stronge man, inowe, a febyll man, but lytyll etc.
