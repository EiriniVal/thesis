To trete of þe propertees of mannes body [\f. 28vb\] and of þe 
parties þerof, we schul first biginne to trete of þe qualitees of þe 
elementis and of þe humoures of whiche þe body is maad. 
 
[}De elementis. Capitulum primum.}] 
Elementis beþ foure, and so beþ foure qualitees of elementis of 
þe whiche eueriche body þat haþ a soule is componed and imade 
as of matir, and nameliche mannes body þat [{is{] nobilest among 
alle þe elementis and most nobilliche is i-ordeined among alle 
þinges þat beþ componed and imade of diuers þinges. Mannes 
body is i-ordeyned to be þe propre instrument of þe resonabil 
soule in his workes of kinde and of wille. 
 
Mannes body is made of foure elementis: of erþe, watir, fire, 
and aier; and eueriche þereof haþ propre qualitees. Foure þer beþ 
iclepid þe firste and principal qualite[{s{], þat is to wite hete, coolde, 
drye, and wetenesse; and ben iclepid þe firste qualites for þey sliden 
first of þe elementis into þe þinges þat ben imaade of elementis. Þey 
ben also iclepid þe principal qualitees for of hem comeþ al þe 
secundarye effectis. Tweyne of þese qualites ben iclepid actiue 
'able to worche', hete and cooldnes. þe oþir tweyne, drynesse and 
wetnesse, ben iclepid passiue '[{able{] to soffre'. And so as þese 
qualites haue maistrie, þe elementis ben iclepid [{actiue oþir 
passiue{] 'able to do or soffre'. Þe firste tweyne ben principallich 
iclepid actiue, no3t for þey worchin alone, for þe passiue qualites 
worchiþ also [{for{] non qualite is in þe body an ydel; but þerfore þey 
|P_130 
beþ iclepid actiue for be þe worchinge of hem þe oþir beþ ibrou3t 
inne and ikept and isaued. 
 
For hete somtyme bringiþ in and kepiþ moistnes and somtyme 
dryenes, als it is isene in salt fleissch. Þe hete of þe salt dissolueþ 
þe parties þat beþ erþy and watry and aiery, and so slakinge and 
neisschinge þe hete bringiþ in moistnes. Hete bringiþ in drynesse: 
for hete worchinge in moistnesse dissolueþ it first and þan he 
distroieþ it; and þan comeþ in drines, þat [{is{] þe file [{of{] þe hete, 
and is also ikept. Þan hete is qualite of elementis most actif, as it is 
sene be þe effect þerof. While hete worchiþ in a þing, first he deleþ 
þe parties þerof and þan þe þing is feblere þat was strengere be þe 
ioynynge togedres of þe parties. Þerfore he wiþstondiþ þe lasse [{þe{] 
worchinge of þat þing þat worchiþ. 
 
[\f. 29ra\] Also hete is þe crafty worchere of al þat is gendred and 
principal worchinge cause. And þis hete gendriþ and saueþ. And 
þerfore frogges somtyme ben igendrid in þe aier be þe hete of 
heuen. The oþir hete is þe hete of elementis and is igendred. And 
þe hete corrumpiþ and distroieþ, as whan þe bemes of li3t comeþ 
togedres in a certein point of a clere body, an 3if þe bemes were 
ioyned in a myrour þan me my3te tende and brenne hurdenne be 
þe reboundinge of þe bemes. And also he bringeþ and lediþ þe 
neþir þinges to þe ouere. Makinge meuynge fro þe middel to þe 
vtmest parties, he dissolueþ and turneþ what is erþy into watery, 
and watery into aiery, and aiery into fury. And so he bringiþ þe 
neþir and þe middel into þe ouere. 
 
Also he naisschiþ þingis þat beþ harde. For worchinge in gret 
boistous substaunce, he dissolueþ it and makeþ it naissche, as it is 
sene in metal þat meltiþ wiþ hete, and dissolueþ and turneþ erþi 
þinges into watery and makeþ hem nessche. Also nessche þinges 
and fletinge he makþ harde, as it is sene in an ey þat is irostid, for 
þe licour and moistoure and sotil parties wastiþ awey and þe erþy 
parties abidiþ and so þe ey wexiþ hard. And harde and þicke 
þinges he makeþ sotil. While it meueþ from þe middel to þe vtmest 
parties, by his strengþe he dissolueþ and todeleþ þing þat he 
worchiþ inne and makeþ it couenable to his worchinge. While he 
trauaileþ to make a þing symple, he mote nedes make it sotile, for 
|P_131 
þe simplenesse of a boistous þing is sotilnesse þat comeþ in be 
wiþdrawinge of fastnes and þicnesse of þe parties, as it is sene in 
yse þat is made sotil whan it is þawed be hete. Also hete be his 
vertu clensith metal and distroieþ þe rust þerof and oþir felþe. 
For worchinge in þe substaunce of þe metalle, he dissolueþ it, and 
3if he findeþ onyþing of drastes oþir of rust, he departiþ and distroyeþ 
it. 3if it be fine golde, he meltiþ it be strengþe of hete and 
destroyeþ it no3t; for fyne golde, þou3 he melte wiþ hete, he lesiþ 
no3t of þe wi3te. Also oþirwhile he[{te{] distroyeþ, as it happiþ 
whan he deleþ more þan he wastiþ. Þan þe humour roteþ and is 
corrupt, as it fareþ in wete hupel of whete; þe hete iclosid þerinne 
dissolueþ and todeliþ þe watir into smoke, and þe smoke iholde 
and iclosid þerinne [\f. 29rb\] nesscheþ þe greynes and makeþ rotye 
and corrumpiþ hem. 
 
And hete kindeliche makeþ of heuy þinges li3te, for whanne 
mosture is iwastid be hete þe wi3te is þe lasse and þing is þe more 
li3t. And be hete worchinge in moysture, smoke is engendrid, þe 
whiche smoke is imade bri3t and purid and iturned into a sotile 
and li3t substaunce of aier, and makeþ þe þing þat he is in þe more 
li3t. And herfore it is þat bodies of bestis [{þat ben quyk ben li3ter 
þan þe bodies of bestis{] þat ben dede for þe hete and þe spirit þat 
is conteined in arteries and veynes. And so bodyes of bestis beþ 
li3ter aftir mete þan tofore for comfort of hete. But somtyme it 
happiþ þat with worchinge hete makeþ þinges heuy, and worchiþ 
in a þing and wastiþ þe moistfulle parties and li3t, and þe boistous 
and heuy parties abidiþ, and þan þe þing is þe more sadfast and 
compact and so þe more heuy. Also by openynge of smale holes 
and poores by strengþe of þe hete, þe spiritis bene idrawe out, and 
by presens of hem þe body is þe li3tere an bi absens of hem þe 
body is þe more heuy. 
 
Also he[{te{] gendriþ reed hiewe and colour, for he forgiþ in a 
matiere and wastiþ þe erþeli parties and turneþ hem into watri and 
þanne into aery and fury. And þanne fury parties biclippiþ þe 
vtmost parties of þe þing and 3eueþ it a liknes, and so firy colour, 
|P_132 
þat is, reed, is gendrid, as it is isene in roses. Also whan by worchinge 
hete hote humours ben igendrid in þe body or in þe herte, þan by 
spredinge of þise hote humours in þe vtmest parties of þe body 
rede colour is igendrid. Also it happiþ þat it discoloureþ a þing, 
for by hete openynge þe poores humours and spiritis goþ out and 
vanyschiþ, and of hem is gode colour. Þanne by here absence 
colour is ilost, þanne discolour is igendrid, as it is iseye in a reed 
roose þat waxiþ white in þe smoke of brimston. 
 
And 3if hete is to strong, hit sleþ kindeliche. For 3if it worchiþ 
at [{þe{] vttermest in a þing, at þe laste it todeliþ it and distroieþ 
at þe ende. And oþirwhile it saueþ þe lif. For bi hete þat 3eueþ 
meouynge to þe herte and to þe spiritis, þe spiritis ben restored in 
þe body and þe fode is couenabliche departid into þe lymes, and 
so þe body is gouerned and haþ lif. 
 
Þanne of þis þat is iseide gedre þou þat hete [\f. 29va\] is an element 
propirte, most abil to worche, most perischinge, most 
meuable to meue, igendrid of þe meuynge of bemes, and multiplieþ 
itsilf and comeþ to oþir and chaungiþ into his owne liknes 
þingis þat he worchiþ inne, and 3eueþ lif to þinges þat ben dede 
and distroyed with coolde and renewiþ hem, as it is isene in 
rootes and plantis þat dyeþ in þe wintir coolde and lyueþ in þe hete 
in springinge tyme. Hete bringiþ þe neþir in þe ouere, and worchiþ 
and distroieþ superfluytees, and clensinge of filþe and hoore. 
 
And in diuers materes he worchiþ diuers effectes and somtyme 
contraries. Þerfor now [{he{] makeþ þinne and naissche and meltiþ 
and openeþ; and a3enward, now he makeþ þicke and hard and 
constreyneþ and makeþ schrinke and he stoppiþ; and now he 
saueth; and [{now he{] destroieþ. And by his propre vertu he 
chaungiþ sauores, and hete chaungiþ sour þinges and scharp 
into swete, as it is sene in fruyt and in grapes. Also passinge 
hete turneþ swete þinges into bittir and salt; for by passinge hete 
b[{re{]nynge þe blood þe blood turneþ into colera, and by grete hete 
and strong seþinge þe sotil aiery parties þat beþ in watir wastiþ 
away, and þe grete erþi parties abidiþ in þe watir and turneþ into 
salt. And hete defieþ and seþiþ rawe þingis, and ripiþ grene þinges, 
and makeþ fruyt ripe. Þerfore in hote contreyes fruyt is raþer ripe 
|P_133 
þan in colde contres, and also more swete. And hete bringiþ forþ 
into acte and dede schappis and liknesses þat beþ ihid in materes, 
as in smale bestis and wormes. For by worchinge of hete goolde, 
bras, and siluer, and oþir metals beþ ibro3te forþ and imaad of 
stones and bene arrayed in a more nobil schap, and by hete þat 
dissolueþ and clensiþ þe asken turneþ into glas. And so hete of 
eir (or aes 'bras') and of kinde is mynystir and seruaunt, for by 
hete þe noblest þinges and schappis of kynde and of craft þat buþ 
ihud comeþ forþ in acte and in dede. 
 
Also hete þat is iprent in þe aier gendriþ rene and cloudes, 
þundringe and li3tnynge, and dewe and oþir suche. For by þe 
vertu þerof þat worchiþ and drawiþ, diuers vapours d[{r{]ye and 
moist beþ idrawe vp to dyuers places and regiouns of þe aier, and 
beþ igadred and iþicked and iturned into cloudes; and þe hete þat 
is iclosed chaungiþ ham into diuers kindes, and turneþ som into 
snow, [\f. 29vb\] som into haile, and into rayn, and springiþ hem al 
aboute into þe erþe. 
 
And hete arereþ þe body þat he is inne from þe middel to þe 
vttirmest roundnesse, as it is isene in þe elementis in þe whiche 
hete haþ þe maistrie, as in aier and in fire þat is fir[{re{]st from þe 
myddel of þerþe. And also þis is isene in [{oyle{] þat fletiþ and 
swymmeþ, and in alle oþir in þe whiche hete haþ maistrie. Also he 
schewiþ þe disposicioun and qualite of þe body þat he is inne, as 
it is in þe body þat hete haþ þe maistrie inne. For libro 1=o= capitulo 
16=o= Constantinus seiþ if þe body is hote þanne is moche fleisch and 
litil fatnesse, rede colour, moche here (blak oþir rede), hote touche 
and gropinge, good witt, a man of gret facounde and of gret 
meuynge, hardy and wraþþeful, louy and lecherous, and desiringe 
moche, [{and{] hastilich defienge for good digestioun, of scharp voys, 
an schamefast, of strong and swift puls. Constantinus settiþ þise 
þinges and signes and many oþir by þe whiche an hote body is 
iknowe. Þis þat is iseide of hete be it inow at þis tyme.
