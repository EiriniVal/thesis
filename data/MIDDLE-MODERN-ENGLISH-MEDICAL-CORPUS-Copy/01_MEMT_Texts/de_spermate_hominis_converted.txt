The sede of man and woman clere as cristal it is

Wiþin þe moder thei ben medillid togedre ful sone 
Þe tone is hote þe toþer is colde congeylid þer it is 
After ix daies þer nature is of [{o{] substance jwys 
Of whi3t colour it begynnyþe as it is wrete 
Tyl a bow3t þe xij day after it is be gete 
Firste gendryþe [{there{] of smale bolles thre 
And eche faste on oþer ben o mow3t hem se 
Of þe heyeste comyþe the braynn: þe hert of thilke amydde: 
The lyuyr þat is nethermyste: is gendrid of þe thyrde 
Thos ben thre þe fyrste lymes þat kennyd beþe 
And in hem is al mannys lyffe as þe boke seyþe 
There nys none of thos iij þat hadde any wownde

After þe fyrste xij dayes þat þe sede haþ whi3t be

And in lasse yef it be a mann for his more hete 
Then þe womman shal be [{makyd{] as it is i wrete
