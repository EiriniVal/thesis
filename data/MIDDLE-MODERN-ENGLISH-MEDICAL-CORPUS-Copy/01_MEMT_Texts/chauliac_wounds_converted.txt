[}A sermon vniuersal of wonde3 & of solucioun of continuite 
Capitulum .primum.}] 
Wonde is solucioun of continuite, recent, sanguinolent, 
without putrefaccioun, made in softe partie3. 
 
Solucion of continuite is set þere for kynde or generalte primo 
de egritudine & sinthomate, which is a comon sikene3 to simple 
& componed particle3. Neþerle3, it is more proprely in symple þan 
in componed after Aueroys in 2.=o= & 3.=o= colliget siþ þer is saued in hem 
more verray reson of continuite. 
 
Oþer þinge3 ar sette for difference, vi3 recens, sanguinolent, without 
putrefaccioun. 
 
In softe partie3 is sette-to þe difference of fracture3 þat falleþ 
in harde membre3, Wherfor after þis generale diuision of particule3 
said Iohannicius þat Cirurgie was double .s. ouþer in flesh or in 
bone. He vnderstode flesh, forsoþ, for muscle3, nerue3 & veyne3, 
which he comprehended vnder softe and mene particule3, Comentator 
nouus in 3. =o= tegni. 
 
Solucion of continuite haþ many spice3 in 2=a= fen primi. canonis 
Auicenne, As is wonde & vlcere, aperture .i. opnyng. puncture, inscisioun. 
euulsioun .i. pullyng out. & fracture & þat kynde. 
 
Of which þe descripcion3 & difference3 shal be said in þair place3. 
 
Ne it is not to charge of þe discordyng of þe name3, alonly þat þe 
þinge3 be vnderstonden. Neþerlee3, I fynde oftetyme3 one for 
anoþer. 
 
|P_6 
Wonde, forsoþ, and vlcere ar one same þing in grece translacioun. 
In arabice þai ar different. 
 
And for certayn. grece translacion said better, ffor after G 4.=o= 
Cerapeutice Of wonde3 or of ulcere3 was 2. most difference3. 
vi3: 
 
Only with-out cause presend; And associate wiþ cause operant. 
fforsoþ, Haly Abbas sermone 6=o= regalis disposicionis haldeþ wonde 
and plage þe same. 
 
Spice3 of solucion [\f. 52a\] of continuite takeþ þe raþest difference of 3. 
þinge3. ffirst of þe nature of particle3 in which þai ar made. 
 
And so we say in 3.=o= tegni þat som beþ in partie3 like and of o 
kinde, Som in organice3. And þo þat ar yn lyke: Som 
beþ in softe partie3, Som in hard partie3, Som in mene. And þo þat 
beþ in softe partie3: Som in flesh, som in fatne3. 
 
Tho, forsoþ, þat ar in hard: Som ar in substaunce of þe bone, Som 
in iuncture3. And þo þat ar in þe mene partie3: Som ar in 
nerue3 & ligament3, Som in arterie3 and veyne3. 
 
Tho, forsoþ, þat beþ in organice3: Som in principale3, as in 
þe herte, þe brayn, þe lyuer. Som in seruyng to principale3, as 
trachea, mery, vesica & oþer. Som in no3t seruyng to hem, as 
ere3, eyen, &c. 
 
Albucasis, forsoþ, seiþ þat wonde3 ar distincte after place3, 
for som beþ made in þe heued, Som in þe necke, brest & þe wombe, 
And after þinge3 of which þai ar made, as it shal be said alsone. 
 
|P_7 
2.=a= difference is itake of þe beyng of þe solucioun in .3.=o= cerapeutice 
ffor [{som is{] symple, som componed. 
 
Simple, in which is no disposicioun complicate. 
 
Componed, in which is complicacioun of 2. disposicion3 or mo. 
I say of disposicion3 not hauyng resone, as of cause wirchyng moste a 
wonde, bot as with-out which it opteneþ not sanacion [{.i. hel{]yng. 
in 4=o= cerapeutice & in capitulo squinantie. And it shal be said 
more of þe vlcere3 with-inforþ. 
 
.3.=a= difference is take of þe propre difference3 of þe selfe solucioun 
in 3.=o= eiustem, as of gretne3 & litelne3, equalite, inequalite, profoundene3 
and superficite, al holy and after parte, in rectitude .i. 
rig3tne3 & obliquite and þat kynde. 
 
Of sich difference3, for-soþ, ar ytake dome3 & intension3 curatyue 
& helpe3 & maner with which þai ar complete. Wherfor saiþ G in 3.=o= 
cerapeutice. þat ouer þe first indicacion3, þat ar not partie3 of 
crafte worthy of resoun sithen þai ar knowen to ydiote3, it bihoueþ 
consider suple indicacion3 particlere3 & substaunce of euery of þe 
particle3 acte, vtilite and posicioun . 
 
Of þe which a lech procedyng, he shal wite a-fore hym þat may 
not be heled. And for hym þat is my3ty & may take helþe; he shal 
consider of fyndyng of helpe3. 
 
Cause3; þof al after G in 2.=o= de egritudine & sinthomate, Vniuersaly 
cause3 of al solucions of continuite beþ þo, forsoþ, þat procedeþ fro 
withoutward, Oþer, forsoþ, of þe selfe body. Neþerle3, cause3 of 
recent wounde3, in als mych as þai beþ wonde3. ar þo, what-someuer 
þai beþ, þat ar bred apte fro withoutforþ for to perse or for to quasse 
or brisse. 
 
|P_8 
And þise specified haly abbas sermone 4.=o= regalis disposicionis, 
while3 he seid, for þise cause3 be made of bodie3 inanimate, as 
swerd, staffe, stone, and lich þing, Or of animate, as of puncture of 
venenous beste3 & morsure of wilde beste3. 
 
Of which is y-take anoþer difference of wonde3. ffor som beþ 
inscision3, Som contusion3, Som, forsoþ, morsure3. Of which also is 
y-take indicacion3 of curyng. neþerle3, bi accident, ffor it is proued 
.4.=o= cerapeutice þat of disposicioun is y-take indicacioun Of cause 
primitiue, as of not beyng and tyme significacion. 
 
Signe3 & dome3. Signe3 of ilke wounde3 sheweþ feling or witte 
& presence. ffor dome3 of wonde3 & of solucion3 of continuite 
ar hadde bi science or knowing of substance, of acte and of vtilite of 
þe particle3 and beyng of disposicion3, as it is alleged aboue. 
 
ffor als mych demed G 4.=o= cerapeutice þat wonde & solucions of 
continuite grete and stronge haueþ no litel perile. þai ar made 
stronge, forsoþ, on 3. manere3: Ouþer for principalte of pacient 
partie or for yuel morigeracioun .i. maneryng, Or for gretnes of 
disposicioun, for which whatsom-euer of percussion3 .i. smytynge3 
take in þe heued and with-in þe breste & þe wombe; þai brynge not 
in litel perile. And moste when any þing of inward þinges is smyten 
wiþ altogider. 
 
Bot þat percusion3 þat ar in þe article3 beþ al yuel morigerate 
.i. manered knoweþ [\f. 52b\] al men almost; Where, forsoþ, beþ tenonthe3 
& nerue3 & vnflesshye & bony region3 it is perile for to ake & 
wake & spasme and for to raue. And wiþ þise which-so-euery 
|P_9 
be made grete. Wonde3 þat nedeþ sewyng aboue, which ar made 
bi al þe transuers of principale muscule3 & þat smyteþ þe grete 
veyne3 & arterie3 & nerues & medulle, bringeþ in most perile. ffirst 
counsaileþ G in primo 6.=i= amphorismorum, þe vesic kutte or þe brayne 
or þe herte or diafragma or any of þe subtile entrale3 or þe lyuer 
or þe wombe, it is mortale after þat of 5=ti= amphorismorum, Quibuscumque 
ydemata &c: To whom-soeuer ydemata .i. tumours or 
bolnynge3 appereþ in vlcere3, þai ar not spasmed. And if in grete 
wonde3 and stronge appere no3t ydema; þat is grete yuel. And he 
calleþ wicked or. maligne vlcere3, as G hym selfe exponeþ 
in þe coment, wounde3 þat ar made after þe heuede3 or ende3 of þe 
muscule3 & most of nerue3. 
 
Bi þe which it is to take hede þat bi perile is vnderstonde deþe of al 
þe body or of particle3 of þe membre þat is priuacion of þe life or 
malefactif .i. yueldoyng or perpetuale and incorrigible vnpower 
of þe membre which is priuacioun of mouyng & felyng & properly of 
þe worchyng of hem. After which þe membre is not saide a membre, 
no a partie of þe body proprely, bot denominatiue and equiuoce, 
as a stony or brassyne ei3 2=o= de anima & 4=o= metharorum 
 
And þis is mych necessarie to a Cirurgien deponyng or vndertaking 
in þe court of wonded men, vi3 forto knowe which woundes ar 
mortale & which wikked or malifica. 
 
ffor which it is to wite after þe entencioun of G 6=o= amphorismorum 
|P_10 
in commento vesicam inscisam &c That wonde3 som bene 
mortale ri3t necessarily, som no3t necessarily but as often-tyme3 
And bi þe contrarye som heleful or sanable alwaie3 or vtterly, Som as 
oft-tyme3. 
 
Mortale necessarily beþ as wounde3 of substaunce of þe hert, 
which sleþ alsone; bi þe commaundement, forsoþ, of kynde al þe 
blod is send to þe hert, of which is made emoragie resolutyue or 
aposteme and opilacion forbeding to send life to al þe bodie. 
 
Þe hert may not longe suffre solucioun of continuite ne hote 
aposteme during þe life, as putteþ Auicen. 
 
More-ouer, mortale necessarily beþ grete wonde3 & persyng þe 
substance of þe brayne & of þe lyuer and of diafragma .i. þe mydrif, 
of þe stomac, of þe smal entrale3. of þe reyne3, of trachee arterie, of 
mery, of þe longe3 & of þe splene, of þe kist of galle3 & of al oþer 
membr3 principale & seruyng to membre3 principale with seruise 
necessarie to life. And cause is, for none of hem ar heled, as it shal 
be proued by resoun sewingly. 
 
Wounde3 mortale not necessarily bot as often-tyme3 beþ litel 
wonde3 and superficiale of þe forsaid membre3 & persyng to þe 
regioun of hem & of the heuede3 of þe muscule3. And cause is, 
for if þai be not wele treted; it bi-falleþ for to dye of hem. If þai be 
wele treted, forsoþ, to be heled: 
 
As I haue seen of þe hynder partie of þe brayne, Of þe which 
partie went ut a litel of þe substance of þe brayne, which 
|P_11 
knowen by hurting in þe memorie .i. mynde, which he recouered after 
þe cure. 
 
Neþerle3, I say not þat he shulde liffe, if one hole celle went out, 
as Thederic telleþ of þat Cellario .i. sadler. Ne G seiþ not of þo 2. 
men þat he se wonded in samaria to heled, lyffyn his maister 
pelope, þat þe substaunce of þe brayne went oute, bot only þe brayne 
was wounded. 
 
Ne of hym þat he see heled in smirnis, as he telleþ in 8.=o= de 
vtilitate. He seiþ no3t þat þe substaunce of þe brayne went out, bot 
to haue be wounded in þe tone of þe ventricule3 geminate .i. doubled. 
And with þat he was supposed cured bi þe wille of godde. 
 
If, forsoþ, he had be wounded in boþe; he had dured litil tyme, 
as he seiþ. Of which he concludeþ þe utilite of doublyng of som 
[\f. 53a\] organic, as it was said aboue in þe anathomie. And þe helyng as 
wele of hym þis as of hem was of ri3t seldom þinge3, As it is said 
in þe comment allegato. 
 
Cause why wonde3 of þe brayne and of þe pannicle3 of it in 
þe maner ysaid be mortale is þis. ffor to hurtyng of þe brayne folweþ 
hurtyng of þe breste [{& of{] thorax & of þe membr3 respiratyue 
.i. breþing, of which þe eucrasia .i. gode crase of þe hert is 
corrupt, of which of necessitee it foloweþ al þe animale to perish, as 
seiþ G 5.=o= de interioribus. Of þe lyuer also y haue sene litel 
wounde3 about þe lobos to be heled; neþerle3, not profounde ne 
wiþ perdicioun of any particle of it, as witnesseþ G selfe / 
 
|P_12 
Cause of which he giffeþ 5.=o= interiorum, ffor þe hert is mortified 
for perdicioun of nutritioun & þe animal .i. beest perisheþ. Neþerle3, 
þis is done in longer tyme. 
 
Wonde3 of þe diafragma [{.i.{] mydref, namely þat be made 
in [{n{]eruous place3, ar incurable, for hem wanteþ blode & with þat 
þa[{i{] haue contynue mouyng. 
 
Wonde3, forsoþ, ar not cured bot if þai reste, þat þe lippe3 be 
conioyned. 
 
Neþerle3, in carnous partie3 þai ar oftentyme3 consolded. 
after G .5.=o= cerapeutice 
 
Also wonde3 of þe longe3, for þat þai ar moste sone apostemate, 
as often-tyme3 also beþ in-curable for-þi þat nouþer þe propre farmacie3 
of vlcere3 may touche þe vlcere, and for þat it is moued after 
respiracion3 & shaked or stirred after co3hynge3. 
 
Also grete wonde3 of trachee arterie, namely in þe cartilaginous 
parte, ar seldom also cured, for þai ar hard and wiþoute blode and þai 
haue continuel respiryng bi þe wonde. Also grete wonde3 of Isophagus 
ar not cured, for passyng of mete & drinke letteþ consolidacioun. 
 
Also grete wonde3 of organice veyne3 ar not cured bot seldom. for 
emorogie of hem þe spirit & þe life perisheþ, Also þat þai may not for 
drede of suffocacioun suffre ligature necessary to restreyne þe 
emorogie. Wonde3 of þe stomac in þe maner said ar mortal & of 
þe smal entrale3, namely about ieiunum, & of þe matrice and of þe 
reyn3 And of þe vesic & of þe galle3, for þay beþ neruous & with-out 
blode, And þe place and þe passyng is of wicked humiditee3, And 
|P_13 
þe seruice of hem is continuly necessari to life. And with þat þe 
medecene3 may not conueniently be applied. 
 
Also wonde3 of þe splene, sithen þat it haþ office necessari to al 
þe body. siþ it is þe toþer lyuer, as many men haþ said, bene ful 
perilous, bot not so perilous as of þe oþer membre3. Also wonde3 
persyng to þe inwardne3 of membre3 ar demed mortale as oft-tyme3, 
for als mych as for þe aier þat entreþ in-to hem withoute alteracion 
offendeþ þe in-ward membre3. Also for bi hem is inspired þe spirit 
And is offended and febled þe vertue. And with þat þai may not 
wele be mondified, And finali þai brede fistule3 & empimate3 with 
which þai dyen. 
 
Signe3 of wlneracioun .i. wondyng of þise membre3 & many 
þinge3 which be lefte-of bi cause of briefnesse [{.i.{] shortne3; 
shal be said in her place3 byneþeforþ. 
 
More-euer, wonde3 & puncture3 þat ar made in þe heuede3 of þe 
muscule3 wher þe nerue3 beþ y-no3 nakened or bare & corde3 & 
ligament3 to 3. fyngers ny3 þe iuncture & þe temple3 ar mortale 
as ofte-tyme3 in 3=o= tegni. The puncture, forsoþ, of þe nerue & of 
þe thenonte is redi for to calle-to þe spasme3 for mych felyng þat 
þai bringe to þe brayne, & by consequens deþ. And cause is þe nocument 
.i. noying þat comeþ fro þe brayne & membre3 respiratiue3, 
as it is said aboue. And for þis said Ipocras 5=o= amphorismorum: 
A spasme aboue-comyng in a wonde is mortale, no3t necessarily, bot 
as often-tyme3, seiþ G in þe Commente / 
 
Perticulere membre3 ar demed mortale when þe principale veyne3, 
arterie3 & bone3 bi wherþorgh þai were quickened [\f. 53b\] & noreshed & 
|P_14 
sustened, be utterly kutte & destroyed and bigynne to wex blac & to 
be mollified & to be cadauerous .i. carion to þe maner of estiomene, 
as in þe kuttyng of þe arme3 and of þe legg3. 
 
Also membre3 ar demed malifica & impotent perpetually. When þe 
nerue3, þe corde3 and þe ligamente3 þat gouerned hem beþ kut 
away & vtterly destroyed, & anone ri3t þair worching, & þay 
bigynne to be made drie & desiccate. 
 
Wonde3, forsoþ, ar vtterly or alwaise sanable or heleable which 
beþ in euchime3 bodie3 & in carnous place3 of fewe nerue3 & 
veyne3 & not of grete capasite ne of profoundene3. 
 
And cause is for to hem oweþ no3t to folowe febre3 ne yuel accidente3, 
alonly þat þai be wele y-gouerned. 
 
And forþy it is gode þat in disposicion3 of sich þinge3 þou 
sai þis. 
 
And also, alonly þat þer come not anoþer þing aboue þat appereþ 
not þat present tyme ne is not wont regulerly for to come. 
 
Wonde3 helable as oft-tyme3 beþ þo þat wiþ a difference ar said 
mortale as oft-tyme3 And indifferent & mene, & after þe 3.=a= signifying, 
nouþer beþ wonde3 in þe ende3 of muscle3 & of þe brayne 
panne & of þe brest & of þe wombe. And cause is, for if þai be wele 
treted and artificialy .i. craftely & þer be do-to gode diligence & þe 
|P_15 
sike be obedient & haue þat beþ necessarie to with-outforþ, þai may 
be cured. If it be not, forsoþ; for to slee hym. 
 
And for-þi in disposicion3 of sich þinge3 yt bihoueþ werly for 
to make mencioun of þis. 
 
Neþerle3, take hede in þy disposicioun þat in seyng þe wonded 
man and þe selfe wonde3 þu haue a precepte of þe court And þat 
þou name þe wonde3 and þe place3 of þe wonde3 And þat þu 3elde 
cause of þi disposicion. 
 
Neþerles. y pray þe þat in demyng & in deponyng þu be not hasti 
and subitaun. bot deliberate & afore-auysed. It is writen, forsoþ, 
of oure fader Ipocras: Dome is hard. And þof al, as it shal be said 
with-inforþ Of wonde3 of þe heued. The laste terme of a wonde 
be of .40. daie3, þe first with-in .7., þe mydde3 to .14. after þe fourme 
of sikene3 acute3. Neþerle3, in suspecte wonde3 it is to bide for to 
deme & for to depose .7. daie3, for-þi þat for comenly with-in sich 
tyme þer be wonte for to appere þe accidente3 gode and yuel of 
febre, of syncop & of alienacion & of spasme & of lich þinge3. 
 
And in þe menewhile beþ to considered þe operacion3 of vertue3 
bi pulse, bi vrine, bi vomite, and bi oþer þinge3 expulsed. 
 
Also þe appetite is to be considered & the sufferaunce and 
loking of þe wonded men & lich þinge3, And after þat þu shale 
fynde by þe doctrine of Ipocras & G in pronosticacio make comparison 
þe strengthe3 of þe vertue & of the sikene3, & of þis 
to þe a capitle & a keye of al pronosticacioun & of dome of 
|P_16 
dede wonde3 & to be salued, with which þu deme and depone 
warly. 
 
Ne it auaileþ no3t, if it war said þat he had not bene dede with al 
þe yuel gouernance of þe worlde, if he had not be wonded; ffor 
also nouþer had he bene dede if he had wolde & had done þo þinge3 
þat beþ of resoun. 
 
It bihoueþ, forsoþ, not only war hem selfe bot þe pacient also. 
 
Þof al, forsoþ, þer beþ a craft curatyue of þo þinge3 þat ar 
made of fortune, neþerle3, þer is not a crafte preseruatif in 3=o= tegni; 
manne3 nature is manyfolde seruaunt or bonde. And so of it 
selfe is it subiecte to diuerse perile3, as it is said in anoþer 
facultee. Also, forsoþ, it is to vnderstonde After Auicen in 4.=o= de 
extraccione sagittarum þat, þof al þe wonde3 be mortale, for þat 
it is no3t to be lefte þat ne a man do after resoun þat. þat is to be done, 
Alonly þat þe Cirurgien be wele required. Bot be þer sette a-fore a 
gode pronosticacioun for worde3 of fonde men for-þi þat oft-tyme3 
som men ar heled wiþ-oute hopyng wonderfully. And if we 
left of, þer shulde falle deþe, And we shuld be proporcioned to 
litelne3 of mercy & of pite. 
 
[\f. 54a\] More-ouer, þu shale wite þat vnicioun .i. onyng in organic partie3 is 
impossible in 3.=o= tegni. 
 
And þe cause is for þe pore3 vtterly in-scised .i. kutted bi when3

Ouer þis, vnicion is possible in flesh after þe first entencioun, In

2=a= entencioun is called when þing3 diuised ar conioyned bi a mene 
ethromogenie as a brasier or founder consoldeþ lede, as seiþ þe 
forsaid comentour. And þis mene is said porus sarcoide3, which 
is made of one humour more grosse þan of flesh and lesse grosse þan 
of bone3. 
 
And cause whi a bone is not consolded after þe first entencioun 
is þe hardne3 of it, as putteþ G in þe texte, ffor bi humidite alone ar 
oned bi þe first vnicioun, And feblene3 of vertue nutritiue & alteratiue, 
seþ þai beþ colde particule3, as seiþ þe forsaid newe comentour, not 
wantyng newe spermatice materie, as seid Haly, for bone3 haþ 
euermore spermatice nutriment bi conuersion suple & assimilacioun. 
 
Of nerue3 & veyne3 seiþ Auicen bi auctorite of G in 5=o= cerapeutice 
þat þai haþ hem in mene maner after þat þai ar mene atuix

hardne3 and softene3, Wherfor þai ar incarnate when þe kuttyng 
is litil & þe body moiste. And þai ar not incarnate in a 
diuersed fro þis. Wherfor seiþ G vbi supra: 
 
It semeþ, forsoþ, experience for to witne3 to reson. In enfante3, 
forsoþ, & in wymmen y haue sene an arterie consolded for moistne3 & 
softnes of þe body And in a 3ong man hauyng a short or litel diuision 
.i. kuttyng. And þis is confermed by þe auctorite of Ipocras in 6. =o= 
amphorismorum. 
 
When þe bone is kutted or þe cartilage or þe prepucium .i. 3erde 
ende or þynne maxille3 .i. cheke bone3, þai growe no3t, ne þai ar no3t 
conglutinate. Ne it auaileþ no3t þe instance of a childes bone, which 
is possible to be consolded, as seiþ G in 3.=o= tegni, which haþ softene3 
& strengþ of vertue for ni3ne3 of natiuite; ne of teþe, for þai ar 
gendred not only in childe-hode, bot in oþer age3, for þai ar not 
gendred of materie ordinate, bot of superfluite, not of vertue first 
informatif, bot of nutrityue, inducyng þe acte of the generatif, 
As said Albertus Bononiensis in lectura amphorismorum. 
 
At þe last demeþ Ipocras 6=o= amphorismorum þat vlcere3 þat beþ 
made in ydropisy men in þe body ar no3t li3tly heled. Wherfor 
seiþ Auicen: Bot solucion, forsoþ, of continuite and ulceracion 
& like þinges to þise, When þai ar made in a membre of gode 
compleccion, þai ar sone heled. And when þai ar in a membre of

It bihoueþ þat many oþer dome3 be kept in þe singuler capitle3 &

In-fixed. þinge3 ar extracte by inuencioun of ingenie3 or witte3. 
 
And þe maner of finding is had bi consyderacioun of þe nature &

Of which 2. is drawe out:

Þof al diuersite of þinge3 infixed be infinite & may not be

or shappe3 of þinge3 y-casten be examined of þe enemys, neþerle3, 
Auicen enforce3 for to comprehende hem vnder 8. maner

Diuersite of membre3 is hadde bi anathomie, for som beþ principale 
& som beþ not principale, And som carnous, in which þai ar febly

Maner, forsoþ, of wirching, which springeþ or ryseþ of þe forsaid

bot þat þe alterate blode of þe þing infixed oweþ to be put oute þat

wiþ hote oile, most if it be douted of aking. 
 
If, forsoþ, it be toxicate .i. venomed, be it procured as bityng3 of

And if it may not li3tly be hadde bi þe maner said, the pacient

And if þo tenacle3 auaile not, be þer taken oþer more stronge. 
And if þai beþ barbulate; be þe barbe3 y-take wiþ canulate3. 
 
And if þe tree haþ gone oute of þe [{so{]kette [{or{] hose, with a

If þe arwe, forsoþ, be immersed or drowned and may not be 
drawen oute bi þe partie bi which it entred; be it put in wiþ impolence3

esely or profitably be done, be it drawen out by þat partie. If, 
forsoþ, it is not possible, be it lefte vn-to þat nature drawe it out or

Aboute which it is to wite þat after þe entencioun of Auicen in 4. =o= 
þer is 3. maner ligature3. Incarnatyue. Expulsiue. & Retentyue. 
 
Ligature incarnatiue is competent to fresh wonde3 & also to fracture3. 
And it is made wiþ a bende fro 2. ende3. plied vn-to þe midde3, 
in bigynnyng at þe opposite parte of þe [{place{] solute, Ledyng þe 
|P_25 
to heued or ende toward þe vpper partie of þe membre, And þe toþer 
toward þe niþer, in taking of þe partie3 liggyng-to als mych as 
shal seme for to spede, in strenyng more aboue þe place y-hurt þan 
in partie3 ligging-to. 
 
Neþerle3, be he war of ouermych stricture & laxacioun; þe terme

forsoþ, of þe bende be sewed And, if it be nede, be þer put moo 
bende3, And be þai volued and lapped by þe same maner. 
 
By þis maner, forsoþ, of bindyng þe to lippe is conioyned with 
þat oþer. Apostemacion is defended, as it is proued 6=o= cerapeutice 
 
[\f. 55b\] Som men, forsoþ, shapeþ in streynyng a cloþe doubled; þai sewe

Ligature expressyue is competent to vlcere3 & to cauerne3 for 
to put out þe materie fro þe profoundne3 And to defende þat 
anoþer materie come not in þe place. And it is made with a 
bende plied fro þe tone ende, in bigynnyng at þe nyþer parti of 
þe selfe membre, þer streynyng it more strongly. Afterward reuoluyng 
it, it is proceded to þe vppermore partie, as doþ G quinto 
cerapeutice, þe vppermore partie to be þat. þat is toward þe 
hert or þe lyuer, fro which al membre3 springeþ; so say I þe vppermore 
partie. 
 
|P_26 
I, forsoþ, shape sich a bende in membre3 inequale .i. vneuen, as 
beþ þe legge3, in kuttyng it on þe to partie fro a palme vn-to

grosse of þe membre; þe curued, bowed partie cut toward 
þe more smal parte. 
 
How many gode3, forsoþ, haþ þis ligature done to me in 
vlcere3, varices, & inflacions of legge3, knowed godde. 
 
Ligature retentyue of medicene3 is competent to membre3 in which 
may not be made stricture ne oþer ligature, as in þe necke and þe 
wombe and in al aposteme3 and disposicion3 dolorous .i. aking. And 
it is made wiþ a bende of one heued or of many ende3 or arme3

it. Maner of vnbyndyng. 
 
Be it softe & vndolorous. And if þe ligamente3 ouer-mych holde

Ouer þat G wille þat þe bende3 be made of gode lynnen cloþe, olde.

Aboute which it is to wite þat þer is 3 maner suture3. Incarnatiue. 
Of blode recentyue. Of þe lippe3 vn-to a tyme seruatyue. 
 
Suture incarnatyue, þat is competent in al wonde3 of lengthed

be it bounden with .2. inuolucion3 at [\f. 56a\] þe first & with one at þe seconde. 
After be þe threde kut som-what fer fro þe knot. 
 
2.=a= maner is suture incarnatyue made wiþ nedile3 or wiþ þe stalke

in festnyng in the to lippe, be þe lippe ledde to þe toþer lippe, 
And be it fiched in it. as doþ bocthers of cloþes. 
 
5.=a= maner suture incarnatyue is made with cloþes & it is conuenient 
in place3 in which we wille þat cicatrice3 appere no3t, as

In grete occasion3, forsoþ, & in cachochimis .i. yuel chymed

conueniently þe forsaid þing3. And þis said G. 6=o= cerapeutice: 
 
Be som man supposed to come to vs pricked suple & wonded & disiuncte, 
þis man, if he be of gode ulcere .i. eucratice, he shal passe

Of fleobotomie counsaileþ þe wise man Rasis & Albucasis þat

Of þe wombe / If he be constipate, be þer made suppositorie3

Of pocion3 which ar wont to be ministred to wonded men I say

And if þe sanie3 [\f. 58a\] be not deriuate to þe wonde, be it opned in a

If þe discrasie be hote, which is knowen bi redne3 & vesicacioun;

Aueroys decurtacioun [{.i. shr{]ynkyng of membre3 o[{r{] sich 
|P_40 
starkne3 þat þay mowe no3t be bowed ne dilated, for in it is no3t take 
a-way operacioun as is in paralisy, bot þer is mutacioun. 
 
Spasme, forsoþ, in 5.=o= de egritudine & sinthomate is one yuel 
mouyng, falling in þe vertue voluntarious motyue, morbous or sike 
of his disposicione. And for-þi it is a sikene3 neruous in 3=o= canonum, 
bi which þe lacerte3 ar moued to her bigynnyng3. And þai ar vnobedient 
in dilatacioun. 
 
Cause3, forsoþ, of it after G in eodem is double, as demed Ipocras: 
Implecioun & euacuacioun. In flegmone3 disposicion3, forsoþ, 
implecioun, In moste brynnyng & most drye febre3, forsoþ, 
euacuacioun. 
 
Þat, forsoþ, þat in bodie3 implete & euacuate, More-ouer, in al 
neruous bodie3; it bifalleth for to be strecched or bent. shewith

crafty men slakeþ hem or þai be put doune. 
 
And after þat same sheweþ thwonge3 made hote at þe fire and 
put out to þe moist aier 3=o= colleget. 
 
.3=a= cause addeþ Auicen þat þof þe materie be no3t proporcionate; 
neþerle3, it is a noying, contristyng or heuying þe brayne, for which 
þe nerue3 flieþ agayne & ar congregate to put out þat selfe cause 
lettyng. 
 
Þerfor þer beþ .3 maner of spasme3: of inanicioun, of replecioun, 
& of þe brayne compassioun. 
 
|P_41 
Þe first is caused most for grete flux3 of blode .5.=o= amphorismorum 
And for vnmoderate hete3 & liquefactyue putrede3 in 2=o=

fforsoþ, spasme3 forsaid, som beþ vniuersale þat ar made when 
þe noying comeþ to þe brayne; enforsyng to put out þe noying. it 
draweþ togider þe nerue3 & neruous membre3 & spasmeþ hem. 
 
Oþer beþ particlere, when þe noying comeþ not to the brayne, 
bot abideþ stille in þe membre in-curuyng it. And þis also witnesseþ 
Auen3oar. 
 
fforsoþ, I say vniuersal, for it holdeþ þe more partie of the 
membre3 to difference of þe epilence þat haldeþ alle. And for-þi it 
is said þe spasme .s. of alle. Neþerle3, it is humide and inter-polate, 
not continue, with noying of þe mynde & of þe feling, as it is declared 
.3.=o= interiorum, which is not in spasmes of which is sermoun here 
made. 
 
fforto enquire exquisiteli differences of spasme, cause3 & maner of 
gendryng is of an oþer speculacioun, wherfor I lefe it of. 
 
|P_42 
It sufficeþ to a [\f. 58b\] Cirurgien to knowe þat is said & signe3 of hem & 
correccion3 if þer be any. Comon signe3 beþ difficulte of mouyng 
of membre3, strecching of þe necke, contraccion of þe lippe3 as if 
he wolde law3, strycture of þe cheke3 & of þe teth & of þe throte, 
And torture of þe eien & of al þe face. 
 
Special signe3 of spasme3 of inanicioun beþ litel & litel comyng-to, 
And after wasting sikene3. 
 
Of replecioun, forsoþ, beþ subitan comyng-to. And after apostem3, 
coldne3 inspissing replecion3. 
 
Signe3, forsoþ, of spasme compassiue beth comyng-to fro cause3 
withoutforþ & it is with aking & mordicacioun & contristacioun. 
 
If noying of þe spasme come to membre3 of þe breþing, þe 
pacient dieþ subitanly. 
 
Spasme confermed is not cured, most of inanicioun. ffor dryne3 
most certanly when it is complete, it is vnsanable .7.=o= cerapeutice. 
Not confermed, forsoþ, receyued som correccioun, specialy 
of replecioun, þat bitokeneþ Ipocras in 2=o= amphorismorum ffebre3 
in spasmo: It is beter febre3 be made in spasme þan spasme 
in febre3. Cure. Cure of it for keping of þe drie spasme is 
shrewed, as saiþ Auicen. Neþerle3, more conuenient cure is a tyne 
& anoyntyng with moist oile after it, And ofte-tyme3 iteracioun of it. 
And if it were possible, þe tyne shulde be made of melke: 
 
And na3ale3 & gargarisme3 And clisterie3 and finalich þe potage3. 
|P_43 
It war best al only þat þer were no febre. þan, forsoþ, be 
þe forsaid þinge3 y-made with waters & oile3. in which be decocte 
lefe3 of salow & broken barly, violette & nenufer. And be þai

Þe mete3 of hem be suppynge3, fatte. li3t, made of almonde3, 
barly & of gode 3uccare & water of flesh, y-take of watre of fleshe3 
of lambe3 & of kide3. 
 
And if þer were medled with þe forsaid þing a litel of gode wyne 
þat yt makeþ to perse, it war not fer fro ri3tne3. 
 
When, forsoþ, þe spasme is moiste, it bihoueþ þat it be cured with 
strong euacuacion3 of grosse humours, as is yera & pillules de agarico 
sharp clisterie3 beþ best, & fleobotomie som-tyme, & gargarisme3 
& na3ale3; sternutorie3 with sharp þing3 beþ expedient. 
 
And anoyntyng3 vp-on þe necke and þe subacelle3 & þe inguyne3 
with hote oile3 of lilie, of coste, of spica, laurium, pul[{egium{], 
sharped with castorie & euforbie, be gode, & coueryng with mych softe

Rogerinus to þis spasme enditeþ sich an oynement and Thederic

In þis vnguento in an oþer place semeþ Thederic / for to adde herbe3

And he calleþ yt Alabaustrum. And it is ri3t propre to contraxions

And if þer fil febre effimere alone, it war gode. 
 
Stufe3 & subfumigacions drye & þo þinge3 þat prouokeþ sudour

Spasme of compassioun, if it be of aking; yt is cured with liptomijs 
and oþer þing3 cesyng aking, as it shal be said of þe wonde3 
of nerue3. 
 
And if it be of p[{u{]ncture of wilde beste3, be yt cured with tiriacle

And in alle be þe brayne conforted & þe heued and þe necke, þe 
backe, þe acelles & inguyne3, anoyntyng with oile of lilie, for it is a 
propre medecene to humide spasme. [\f. 59a\] And Auen3oar saiþ þat þer

Also paralisi folweþ wonde3 & contusion3 most of þe heued & of 
al þe bak, as it is declared by many example3 in 3=o= interiorum. 
Wheþer, forsoþ, it folweþ wonde3 of þe same partie or of þe contrary, 
þer shal be made mencioun withinforþ in þe wonde3 of þe

Paralisy, forsoþ, is mollifying of nerue3 with priuacioun of feling 
& mouyng as often-tyme3. As spasme was hardne3 with yuel mouyng 
& chaunged, as it was said 3=o= colliget. Wherfor it is said in 3.=o= interiorum: 
 
As apoplexia is mollicie3 .i. softne3 of alle þe body, so is paralisy 
of one half, som-tyme, forsoþ, of þe ri3t halfe, som-tyme of þe 
lefte, Som-tyme of o party as of þe hand or of þe fote. 
 
And for-þy take nowe þe diuisioun of paralisi, as of þe spasme, 
in paralisi vniuersal & particler. vniuersale of al þe side; particler 
of one membre. 
 
Cause3, forsoþ, of sich paralisy & sich ablacioun .i. taking 
away of Mouyng & felyng beþ double, vi3 withoutforþ & withinforþ. 
 
With-out[{-forþ{], as falling & smytyng, kuttyng, dilatacioun,

viscous, which opilateþ .i. stoppeþ þe selfe nerue3 in þe brayne & in

maner þis is, And how somtyme is lost mouyng And þer abideþ felyng, 
And þe difference3 & al þe cause3 exquisitely, it is of an oþer speculacioun.

It sufficeþ, for-soþ, to a Cirurgien for to knowe þat is said And for

And for þis be þai redde in primo & 3.=o= de interioribus. Þu

Þe outwarde cause3 bi shewing of þe pacient. 
 
It may be demed also þat paralisy & al sikene3 of nerue3 beþ 
hard to cure, for þai haf litel of hote nature, which is þe doar or

hardilich cured. 
 
More-ouer, it is demed þat trembling and febre3 in þe paralisy 
bitokeneþ gode. 
 
Ouer þat, paralisy þat is made of a stroke, not much brissyng þe

If, forsoþ, þai be brissed superflue, þer is no hope þat it be heled. 
ffor wonde3 of nerue3 ar not parfitely cured or consolded, as it
