of þe ferthe boke. 
 
HEre bigynneþ þe .4.=a= booke of vlceres after Guido. 
 
[\f. 81a\] A sermon vniuersale of vlcere3 Capitulum .1.=m= 
 
Vlc[{us{] or vlcer, after entension of G, 4.=o= cerapeutice, is a solucion of 
|P_5 
contynuite in þe flesh in which is one or many disposicion3 þat letteþ consoldyng, 
of which is caused, as addeþ Auicen, sanie or putrede. 
 
Þat, forsoþ, þat Henric addeþ is not necessary in diffinicione, vi3 puttyng 
out filth or vnclenne3 longer þan by .7. daye3, ffor-why tyme makeþ or doþ 
no þing ad rumbum; whatsom-euer tyme, forsoþ, þe disposicioun writen afore 
is founden in the flesh, Also þof it be in þe first day, it is an vlcere. 
 
Ne G spekyng of þo .7. daie3 agayn thesil said not þat ouer þat it is an 
vlcere. Ne þat auaileþ not þat he seid. þat olde men said þat euery wonde 
after þat it passeþ .4.0. daie3, it passeþ in-to an vlcere; ffor þai say not in-to 
an vlcere, bot in-to a fistule. 
 
ffor-whi an aposteme or an exiture, als sone as it is opned, may passe in-to 
an vlcere / In a fistule, forsoþ, it bihoueþ þat þer come a-tuix many daie3 or 
collositee, which is his essenciale difference, be gendred. 
 
Þerfor þe diffinicion writen afore is gode ynowe. 
 
Solucion, forsoþ, of continuite is set for generalitee .i. kynde. 
 
Which, forsoþ, & how many beþ spices of it, it was shewed euidently aboue 
of þe wonde3, Oþer þynges ar put for difference. 
 
In carnous or softe particule3 is put to difference of corrupcion3 
of bone3 which proprely ar not vlcere3 bot corrupcion3 & also disrupcions, 
as putteþ Auicen in .4.=o=. Oþer þinge3 ar put to þe difference of wonde3. 
 
ffor-whi a wonde is a solucioun by yt selfe with-outen comunicacion of any 
disposicioun goyng a-fore or folowyng, as seiþ G vbi supra. Suple þat makeþ & 
augmenteþ þe vlcere & letteþ þe consolding. Neþerle3, I say not þat ne it 
may haf composicioun of disposicion3 propre to it & sewing of necessite, as 
gretne3 and litelne3, deperdicioun of substaunce & not deperdicioun, [{equalite{] 
|P_6 
& inequalite, & of oþer Of which þe intension repugneþ not mych to þe 
generale entensioun of wonde3 in als mych as wonde3, as it was somwhat 
said aboue in þe tretys of hem, of which it sheweþ þat generaly wonde3 in 
regard of vlcere3 ar symple; vlcere3 euer-more ar said componed. 
 
Þai ar componed, forsoþ, wiþ disposicion3 which may stand [{or be{] 
biside bi hem selfe. 
 
Auicen addeþ sanie and putrede, bi which he vnderstandeþ filth, squame3 
& cruste3 þat may be-falle in þo vlcere3. 
 
Spice3, forsoþ, of vlcere3, þof al after Haly Abbas, sermone .7.=o=, primi libri 
regalis disposicionis, þai take her most rathe difference3 of .3. þinge3, of 
which þai ar parfourmed & componed, .s. of cause3, sikene3 & accidente3, 
neþerle3, by cause of breuene3, not impliand þe disposicions as first men 
dide, primo cerapeutice, þat we comprehend better þe sayinge3 of Auicen, 
which among oþer saiþ better of vlcere3, say we þat spice3 of vlcere3 ar y-take 
of 2 þinge3, vi3 of cause3 & accidente3, for the difference3 þat ar y-taken 
of membre3 & comon connotacion3 are open ynowe in þe aposteme3 
and wonde3, And þai shal be shewed also wyþ-inforþ in þe fistule3. 
 
Of cause3 ar y-take .5. spice3 of vlcere3, more propre, neþerle3, & famose, 
.s. vlcere virulent & corrosyue & ambulatif, sordide & putride, Cauernous 
& profounde. ffistle & Cancre. 
 
Of accidente3 ar y-take som comon spice3 which som-tyme with grete diminute 
ar founden with wonde3, vi3 vlcere discrasiate, dolorous, apostemous, 
contused, with softe & superflue fleshe; vlcere wiþ hardne3 & tenebrosite 
|P_7 
of lippe3, wiþ a corrupt bone, wiþ varice3; or an vlcere of hard consoldyng with 
a propretee hid to ous. 
 
Vlcere virulent, corrosyue & ambulatif is said an vlcere, [\f. 81b\] which bi his 
malice & sharpne3 in puttyng out virulence consumeþ the membre in 
mortifying & wasteþ it. 
 
Vlcere sordide & putrefactif is said an vlcere which bi his malice putrefieþ 
þe membre in leuyng viscosite or softe flesh or crustous, stynkyng, fro which is 
raised vp a stynkynge fume & cadauerous. 
 
Vlcere cauernous is þat of which þe orifice is streite & profondite brode & 
hid. And in goyng a-side hider & þider it haþ many waie3 with-out hardne3 & 
callosite. 
 
ffistule is a- like vlcere with hardne3 & callosyte. 
Cancer is an vlcere brode & horrible, sordide, of which þe lippe3 ar hard 
and inuersate. 
 
Vlcer discrasiate is an vlcere in which yuel qualitee out of nature haþ 
lordship. 
 
Vlcere dolorous is an vlcere in whych is founden sensibilite .i. feling of 
contrarie þing. 
 
Vlcer apostemous is in which is tumour .i. bolnyng out of nature, bred or 
brou3t forþ of som humour. 
 
Vlcere wiþ softe, superflue flesh is in which is founden marcide .i. faded 
flesh out of kynde. 
 
Vlcere with tenebrosite & hardne3 is an vlcere hard, liuide in þe circuite 
wiþ-out stynkyng. 
 
Vlcere with bone corrupt is an vlcere fallyng agayn, hauyng softe flesh in 
which most li3tly perseþ a tent, when he fyndeþ it rough or sharp. 
 
|P_8 
Vlcere varicous is an vlcere in which on þe vpper party ar grosse and replete 
veyne3 vnnaturale, inbibyng þat vlcere. 
 
Vlcere of hard consolding wiþ a proprete hid to vs is an vlcere which wiþout 
open cause may not be consolded. Causes. Cause3 of vlcere3 beþ double: 
antecedent and coniuncte, ffor þai haue not proprely primityue cause3, as 
seiþ Dinus super 4. Canonis, sith in þe first comyng-to in bristyng þe flesh 
þai may not gendre sanie, þof al þai may wele sewyngly, for-þi þat þai may 
moue þe antecedente3 & coniuncte .s. cause3. 
 
Cause3 antecedente3 ar shrewedne3 of humours & ouermych quantite 
of hem, my3ti for to corrode & for to corrupt p[{ar{]ticle3 of þe body, which 
forsoþ ar gendred of malice of gouernaunce & of trespace of al þe body or of 
som particule, vi3 of þe lyuer or of þe splene. 
 
Cause3, forsoþ, coniuncte ar malice3 of complexion3 inducte in þe vlcerate 
particule3 of cause3 antecedente3 ysaid or of wonde3 & exiture3 & also 
pustle3 yopned. ffor-whi as of formica and herpeste is gendred an vlcere 
corrosif, so is a sordide of carbuncle & antrace, And a profounde & cauernous 
of aposteme3. Wherof seiþ G 4.=o= cerapeutice, And þer semeþ to be .3. 
maners of vlcere3 dissanable .i. vnheleable or hard to hele: 
 
Þat þat is of discrasye of þe subiecte flesh. 
 
And þat þat is of shrewedne3 of inflowing blode. And .3.=a=, forsoþ, is of 
quantite. And .4.=a=, for discrasie somtyme, forsoþ, is of qualite alone, 
somtyme, forsoþ, with tumour & materie. 
 
And he addeþ in þe comente .6.=o= amphorismorum, vlcera annua vlcere3 of 
a 3ere; neþerle3, after grec translacioun þat is for þe passion of a corrupt 
bone. And it foloweþ , .4.=o= cerapeutice, It byfalleþ, forsoþ, som-tyme som of þe 
forsaid disposicions or alle togider to be medled. 
 
Of which many spice3 of vlcere3 was nowe nombred aboue. Neþerle3, it 
shal be treted of þe symple þat þe doctrine of þe componed be had bi hem. 
Cause3, forsoþ, of flux & deriuacioun of humours be required .i. so3t in þe 
|P_9 
comon sermoun of apostem3. Sanies. Sanie3 is an humidite alterate and 
putrefied, gendred of blode or of flesh ybrissed as asshe3 extraneate fro 
tree3 bi naturale hete is said alterate & putrefied, gendred of blode; 
farmacorum: Ther is .3. maner alteracion3. ffirst is made of naturale hete 
in loueable mete. Anoþer is ymade of extranee hete in materie putrefactible. 
.3.=a= is made of mixte heete [\f. 82a\] in mene materie. 
 
Of the first alteracioun is made materie nutrime[{n{]tale, of þe toþer two 
is made sanie3 It is said, forsoþ, to be made of blode or of flesh brissed, which 
blode, forsoþ, when it comeþ to an vlcere. it is turned to corrupcioun, as 
seith Auicen, for debilite of þe membre, for which þe superfluitee3 of membre3 
beyng ny3 or drawen to it Or for vnguente3 mollifying & anoynting it 
wiþ her moistene3 & her vnctuositee. 
 
And þis cause of sanie is principale & helpyng, as seid dinus vp-on þat place. 
And þan for þe superfluitee3 attracte, as hym-selfe wittenesseþ, may not 
perfetly be gouerned of naturale hete, it bifalleþ þat in hem is made an 
extranee hete, for þe which þer is som mouyng of putrefaccioun in hem, 
Of which it bifalleþ þat it is turned in-to sanie. And þus is had þe cause 
materiale. And for-þi for þat in sich conuersioun þe hete is euermore 
eked & extranyed þat þer be fi3tyng wiþ þe materie vn-to þe sanie be made, it 
is said bi G in comento 2=o= Amphorismorum þat sanie is made of humours in 
inflamyng .i. brennyng as asshen of tree3. And þis seiþ þe Amphorisme of 
Ipocras: 
 
|P_10 
Akyng3 & febre3 falleþ more about generacion3 of sanie þan þe sanie 
ymade. 
 
Sanie, forsoþ, is made on .2. maners. proprely for þat þat is white, li3t or 
softe, wantyng horrible stynch, y-praised in þe comon sermon of Aposteme3. 
Largeli for ych humidite alterate out of kynde. 
 
And of þis it it is said þat som is subtile þat is said virus, som grosse þat is 
said sorde3; som mene þat sympliciter is called sanie It is, forsoþ, to wite þat 
þis sanie, som is litel, And þis bifalleþ in concaue wonde3 & in oþer in as mych 
as þai be wonde3. 
 
Oþer is mych, which, forsoþ, bifalleþ in vlcere3. And for-þi said henric, & 
wele, þat it bihoueþ þat þe sanie of vlcere3 be more þan is dwe. 
 
Of which þinge3 3e may see þat sanie is a mene superfluite, generate of 
mediocrite .i. mene3 of humours, bred in-to seminale or white qualite, As 
seid þe newe comentour super 3=o= tegni. The membre3, forsoþ, ar white þat 
gendreþ sanie & sperme, as experience sheweþ of long washing of flesh. 
 
Virulence is a subtile superfluite, generate of superfluite of aquous 
humours, which is double hote & colde, cerous & rubicunde. 
 
Sorde3 is a grosse superfluite, generate of grosse humours, which is triple 
.i. on .3. maners: som spisse, inequale & coagulate, white; som blac. 
 
Oþer, forsoþ, as cinerous fece3. 
 
Squame3 beþ litele, hard super-fluite3 in bodie3 to þe maner of scale3 of 
|P_11 
fishe3, gendred about þe vlcere of [{ni{]trosite of humours. 
 
Cruste3 ar of þe same [{but{] þat þai ar more spisse & more grosse & 
gendred aboue the vlcere3. Signe3 & Domes. Signe3 of vlcere3 ar [{had{] of 
her diffinicion3 ygiffen. 
 
Signe3 of materie3 inflowing ar said in þe doctrine of aposteme3. 
 
Als ofte as þu see3 a wonde & an exiture put out vnloueable sanie & more 
þan it oweþ, soppose hem to come to an vlcere. 
 
Ipocras in 6=o= amphorismorum demeþ þat whatsomeuer vlcere3 beþ 3erly 
or of a 3ere or haþ longer tyme, it is nede a bone to be put out & 
concaue cicatrice3 to be made. 
 
And in þe coment of G, neþerle3, it is had more clerely in arabic translacioun 
þat a wonde of his longne3 sheweþ her moste worstne3. 
 
Ouer þat, after Auicen, primo canonum, fen .4.=a=, Euery vlcere þat sone is 
turned agayne after þat it is replete wyþ flesh & oweþ to be consolded, it is in 
way to comyng to a fistule. 
 
Also Haly Abbas, .8.=o= sermone, prime partis libri disposicionis regalis demeþ 
þat which-euer of vlcere3, symple or componed, if it passe þe space of 
.40 daie3, [\f. 82b\] it is called fro þens-forþ a fistule, not verray but similitudinarie, 
as hem-selfe exponeþ in þe folowinge3, And it is shewed wiþ-inforþ of þe 
fistule3. 
 
Moreouer, Auicen in 4=o= demeþ þat hard vlcere3 goyng to blacne3-ward & 
grene3 is yuel. It is signified, forsoþ, þat naturale hete is destroied in hem. 
Ouer þat, he seiþ þat colde vlcere3 ar white & softe, quietyng for medecene3 
|P_12 
calefactyue3, & hote, declynyng to redne3, ar delected in colde. And 
touching vp-on hem bereþ mych witne3. 
 
Also drie and moiste ar knowen bi her effecte3. 
 
More-ouer, in euel vlcere3, when þer is associate þe colour of þe body. as 
white, purulente or citrine; it is signified þat þe lyuer & þe blode of it ar 
corrupt. Ouer þat, vlcere3 þat comeþ suscesyue of sikenesse3 ar of yuel 
curacioun. 
 
Vlcere3 castyng doun or away here3 in þe circuite ar yuel, And þe 
bredyng agayn beþ gode. 
 
And it is said bi Ipocras in libro de signis mortis velocis: 
 
Þat when þe vlcere3 of men beþ softe or li3t & apostemate & his resoun is 
distroied, he dieþ. 
 
More-ouer, vlcere3 þat in successioun of virulence gendreþ louable sanie; 
ar gode; þai signifieþ, forsoþ, þat nature is stronge & materie obedient. 
Dome3 of sanie ar said aboue. 
 
Of sayinge3 of þe letter of Auicen ynow or mych intricate it is concluded 
þat vlcere3 of þe extremitee3, of þe lacerte3 of þe backe, of þe thie3 & of 
þe arme3, And also of inward membre3 & persing to hem ar perilous. 
 
More-ouer, in vlcere3 in which bifore þe forsaid mundificacioun ar ministred 
bredyng3 of flesh, þer is y-gendred yuel flesh & superflue. 
 
Ouer þat, round vlcere3 or of late consolidacioun, And for-þi þai ar 
sleyng childre. 
 
And G conseileþ in hem þat þe fourme of hem be rectified wiþ a cauterie. 
More-ouer, vlcere3 colonum .i. of extremitee3 adduceþ aposteme3 in 
glandulous place3, And most when þe bodie is plectoric; þer passeþ, 
|P_13 
forsoþ, þe materie3 þat ar inflowed to þe vlcere3, And for spongiositee of 
þo partie3 þai ar receyued & incuniate þere. 
 
Ouer þat, when medicyne3 helpeþ in vlcere3 or at lest noyeþ not, it is 
signified þat þay ar conuenient. And it bihoueþ for to adden desiccatyue in 
strength. When, forsoþ, þai adde in-to hotenesse and redne3; it bihoueþ for 
to minush þe hete with infrigidatiue3. When, forsoþ, þai adde in-to coldene3 
& obfuscacioun .i. derkne3 or blacne3, þan minush þu infrigidatyue3 with 
calefactiue3. When, forsoþ, þai adden in-to softene3 of þe vlcere, þan it 
bihoueþ forto adde stiptices. When, forsoþ, þai corrode & profounde þe 
vlcere; þen it is conuenient for to breke þe abstersioun of it. And make not 
þe medecene abstersyue þe for to erre more þan it bihoueþ, for in corroding 
þe membre þer is added in-to moistene3 & virulence, And þu, in 
trowing þat it be of þe malice of þe vlcere, adde3 in it, And so þe vlcere is 
made more profounde & more hote, like to apostemous, when þe sikeman 
feleþ mordicacioun. 
 
Ouer þat, of þinge3 more noying to vlcere3 is meridionale day & humidite 
of þe aier with calidite. And for þis is it said þat vlcere3 of þe legge3 in 
Auinion ar more hardly cured þan at Parise. Of which of wonde3 of 
þe heued is founden þe contrarie in þe regions ysaid for þe coldne3 & dryne3 
soueraynly noyng to þe brayne. 
 
More-ouer, þu owe to witte þat as dome3 of wonde3 ar communicate to þise, 
so þise to hem. 
 
And for-þi it is to recourse to hem in þe comon sermoun of tretys of wonde3. 
 
|P_14 
Cure. Cure of vlcere3 byholdeþ .2. þinge3, .s. an vlcere in als mych as an 
vlcere And an vlcere as componed wiþ his cause of hys accident, or in sich a 
membre or in whatsomeuer disposicion. 
 
In so mych, [\f. 83a\] forsoþ, as an vlcere is an vlcere, it requireþ desiccacioun 
after as it is deduced by many sayinge3 of Ipocras in .4.=o= cerapeutice. 
And þof al vlcere3 in þis be co[{n{]uenient with wonde3, neþerle3, þai ar 
different in more desiccacioun. ffor-whi vlcere3 nedeþ more desiccacioun 
þan wonde3, sith þay haue more humidite. 
 
And for-þi þe entension3 & with which þyng3 þai ar complete, be þai 
required in the tretys of wonde3, specialy of concaue3. 
 
In so mych, forsoþ, as sich an vlcere is componed wiþ his cause or oþer 
disposicioun gendryng & augmenting it, it requireþ ablacioun .i. takyng 
away of þe cause & þe disposicioun augmentyng & gendring þat vlcere, as it is 
deduced per totum .4.=m= librum. 
 
And þis cure is not proprely of þe vlcere bot of þe disposicioun. And in þis 
þe cure of an vlcere is conuenient wiþ cure of aposteme3. 
 
And for-þi þat þat defaileþ here; be it required in the tretys of aposteme3 
& in þe sermon of accidente3 of wonde3. Þerfor þer is double entension of 
sich disposicion3 after G in principio .4.=i= cerapeutice: 
 
Ouþer finali for to kut away sich disposicion3 fro þe body Or for to 
ouercome þe noying þat is of hem. 
|P_15 
And þis is to sey þat þe cure is double. Curatyue & preseruatif. Bot 
þis, forsoþ, is possible for to wirche when þe disposicioun is al maner wise 
litel. It, forsoþ, beyng grete, is yt not conuenyent for to brynge þe vlcere in-to 
a cicatrice afore þat þe disposicioun be heled. 
 
Þerfor þe cure of vlcere3 as sich componed wo[{n{]de3 with disposicion3 haþ 
.3. or .4. speciale entension3: .1.=a= ordeyneþ þe life, .2.=a= equateþ þe 
materie antecedent, .3.=a= rectifieþ þe accidente3 & þe coniuncte disposicion3, 
And þe .4.=a=, þe disposicions y-kut away, commaundeþ for to reduce þe 
cure of vlcere3 to þe cure of concaue wonde3. 
 
.1.=a= & 2.=a= entension3 ar complete after þe nature of þe materie þat 
trespaseþ & þat is gendred in þe body, in auoiding & diuertyng with 
fleobotomie, purgacions & diete3, cauterie3, vomitee3 & oþer diuersion3 & in 
with-settyng or wiþ-takyng þe flux in byndyng, epithimiyng, oyntyng with 
bole armeniac & oþer infrigiding & stiptikyng, Of alle which þe doctrine was 
giffen sufficiently in þe tretys of aposteme3. G, forsoþ, saiþ þus in 4=o= cerapeutice: 
And shrewed humours in-flowing to vlcerate particule3, þe heling, 
forsoþ, which is as of vlcerate, shal be said here. 
 
Þat, forsoþ, þat is of cacochimie .i. yuel chyme or of plectory in þe propre 
resonyng3 of hem is nowe said aboue in þe tretys of aposteme3. And he 
specifieþ þe maner of boþe or of aither. 
 
Therfor when þe humours is a lite more & not mych more 
shrewed, for-þi þat it is vlcerate after þe materie or nature þat infloweþ, it is 
conuenient for to forbede or defende it & repercusse it in stiptikyng & infrigidyng 
|P_16 
þo particle3 þat ar afore þe vlcerate. And it byhoueþ, for-soþ, for 
to bigynne þe superligacioun [{.i. bi{]ndyng aboue, suple repercussiue, 
at þ[{e{] pacient for to haue aboue, fors[{oþe{], þe hole .s. particle, as Ipocras 
comm[{aunded{] in fracture. 
 
Sich ligature, [{fors{]oþ, constreyneþ þe waie3 bi wh[{ich þe{] materie infloweþ 
to þ[{e partic{]le. 
 
Bot in þo vlcere3, f[{orsoþ, we{] shal bringe mo drie far[{macie3{] þen þo þat 
beþ profered or giffen to symple .s. wonde3 - lo þe difference! 
Þe flowing, forsoþ, not mowing be with-holden of þe farmacie3 – lo, a 
gode practic / in serching þe cause of it, it bihoueþ first for to kut it a-way. 
Þerfor, if it bifalle for any inbecillite .i. waikenesse of þe particle takyng þe 
reume, þat is to be heled. 
 
To þis, forsoþ, þer shal be a propre heling of þise vlcerate particle3. 
 
If, forsoþ, it be for multitude or cacochimie [\f. 83b\] of al þe body or of any of 
þe particle3 liggyng aboue, þat is first to be corrected.

And þof al þai be contrarie to þe vlcere. Neþerle3, while3 the akyng is not

Copie or plente, forsoþ, of medicine3 sedatyue3 3e had aboue in þe

Of an vlcere apostemous. Auicen seiþ it bihoueþ þat þu be helping in 
defending þe aposteme. ffor it is not possible þat with þe aposteme þe vlcere

And if it be not possible to þe þat þu defende it; cure it whatsoeuer 
[{yt{] be with his curacioun. with obseruance of þe selfe vlcere. 
 
Curacion, forsoþ, of aposteme3 is seid aboue in tretys of aposteme3 And 
also in þe comon sermon of wonde3. Of an vlcere contused G seiþ þat in 
whatsomeuer vlcere3 þe flesh is contused, it byhoueþ it to be putrefied & 
conuerted in-to sanie, And after to be gendred newe. 
 
Þise, forsoþ, after Auicen in first nedeþ þat þai be mollified & moisted, as 
it was said aboue of þe aposteme3 in contused wonde3. Of vlcere3 wiþ 
superflwe flesh. And perauenture, seiþ Auicen. þer springeþ or bredeþ 
yuel flesh, wherfor it is necessarie þat it be corroded wiþ a sharp medicene 
And be a-noynted wiþout-forþ with infrigidatyuez. Afterward be it eradicate 
.i. out-roted with þat þat escare3 ar eradicate with. Afterward be it 
cured. 
 
And to sich flesh to be corroded ar gode trocisces of affodille3 & 
vnguentum apostolorum & egipciacum & oþer þat ar said of superflue flesh in 
|P_19 
þe tretys of wonde3 And shal be said ri3t redily wiþ-in-forþ. Of an vlcere with 
hardne3 & tenebrosite of lippes. 
 
Auicen seiþ [\f. 84a\] þat when þat þat is in þe circuite of vlcere3 is corrupte, 
it waxeþ grene & blac. Cure þis wiþ scarpellacioun & extraccioun of 
blode And also with ventose3. Afterward to put to hem a drie sponge & 
afterward medicyne3 exsiccatiue3. 
 
If, forsoþ, þe disposisioun is more extented; G seiþ in .4.=o= cerapeutice þat

or to be cured in tyme suple with medicene3 acute3. And it is opne þat it

Som, forsoþ, wil be cured bi longar tyme with-out kuttyng. Som ar 
prompte or redy for to suffre what-someuer bi cause of sone helyng. 
 
Neþerle3, he sayþ byneþeforþ. fforsoþ, it is most redie for to kutte, It is 
more artificiale &, forsoþ, more for to hele wiþ farmacie3. Of an vlcere with 
varyces G conseileþ in eodem .4.=o= þat we hele hem first, sewingly we owe to 
hele þe vlcere. 
 
Neþerle3, þe cure of hem is said aboue in þe tretys of apostem3. Of an 
vlcere wiþ a corrupt bone - where-of seiþ Auicen also: And if þer come 
aboue in þe vlcere3 shiuere3 of bone3 & pannicle3 & oþer þing3, hastye þe 
no3t in drawyng hem out, bot do þat þat we said aboue in þe chapitle of 
wonde3 of þe heued. fforsoþ, if þe bone be corrupte, it is þe counsaile of hym 
for to kut þe flesh & for to vncouere þat bone as mych as shale be possible, & 
þat with rasours & corrosyue3, as it shal be said with-inforþ of an vlcerate legge. 
 
And it discouered, if it be possible for to take away þat is about it, wee shal 
do it wiþ fricacion, And we shal not kut it. 
 
And we shal doo þat, þe exposicion of which is in þe capitule of corrupcioun 
of a bone, in which he seiþ, Curacion of bone is þe fricacioun of it And his 
abscisioun & þe sawyng of it. 
 
ffor-why it is nede for to shaue & for to [{cau{]teri3e in comyng to þe 
|P_20 
vttermost or last of þe corrupsioun of it, þat þe barke or rynde falle by hem-selfe 
or wiþ helpe3 of medicene3. 
 
Vn-to which Auicen praiseþ þiis:

aduste, And þat is rede erþe, as smal as grauel eris, corticis pini ana, be 
þai aggregate suple wiþ hony. And make an emplaster. 
 
It is forsoþ, as he seiþ, wonderful, makyng þe cortices of þe bone3 for to falle 
& gode flesh for to brede aboue. 
 
And certe3 Lamfranc after al rasour in þis case praiseþ actuale cauterie. 
And seiþ wele, for if þe corrupcioun of a bone be of humidite, defoulyng 
yt, no þing so sone drieþ it & vnfaylyngly bot nere & ferre as actuale fyre. 
 
After þe cauterie, forsoþ, þe self Lamfranc commaundeþ for to infuse þe

of þe bone contynuely. And after: 
 
I incarne & consolde it wiþ þe puluer of þe emplastre y-said. 
 
Þat if þe corrupcioun come to þe middel, þan seiþ Auicen þat þer is 
none excusasioun þat ne þer be ytake þat bone with his myddel, As telleþ 
Albucasis þat he dide in corrupcioun of a bone of þe thie of a 3ong man of 30 
3ere. And if it be of þo þat may [{be{] sawen .s. sarrate, siker þe of þe

Þerfor þe euacuacion y-done as it was done in þat womman of rome sufferyng

Wherfor seiþ Auicen in .4.=o=, þe best cure of þise yuel vlcere3 is mundifying

mundifieþ it alone, with ventose3 & scaratacion3 & sanguisuges & epithimacion3 
rectifying þe opilacioun. 
 
And rectifying of blode with ri3t diete. And afterward it is to come to þe

And aboue commaundeþ Lamfranc a mundificatif made of succo absinthij,

And when sich maner vlcere3 ar superflue in corrupcioun, it is necessarie 
after Auicen þat þe corrupcion3 be raised vp with a fired cauterie or with a

And to incarne, forsoþ, seiþ Auicen, þat it bihoueþ þat þe medicyne3 be 
made rynnyng, lauatif, with viscosite cleuyng-to. And be þai caste in hem 
wiþ clisterie3 And be þay [\f. 86b\] put in wiþ lichinie3 & tente3. 
 
And we, forsoþ, saiþ Auicen, ar nowe experte or haþ proued emplastrum 
apostolicon .i. apostolorum & of centauree, when it is filled with it, þat it 
is ri3t meruailous. 
 
Afterward, forsoþ, addeþ G yryos & symphicum, after farina ordei & lich 
þinge3. Aboue be put emplastre & cloþes anoynted with som þyng þat haþ 
to rectifie hem, as diapalma & emplastrum nigrum [{or{] flauum with galles & 
mel cocte wiþ puluer of thure, mirre & aloen or som of þise or alle to-gider 
& grosse stiptic wyne. And after be it bounden, as techeþ G, 2=o= ad 
glauconem, And henric approueþ mych þat ligature. 
 
And þof al þe letture of G þere be intricate yno3, neþerle3, be it assummed 
þus, þat after þe mundificacioun & expulsioun of þe materie be þer 
put vp-on al þe cauerne an emplastre incarnatyue of þo y-said, persed als 
mych as holdeþ þe orifice of þe vlcere. And aboue þe orifice be put þat þat 
was amoued fro þe þersed. 
 
And after be it bounden streytely with a bende contenyng boþe extremitee3 
of þe cauerne, in bygynnyng at þe grounde of it vn-to þe orifice of it, 
relaxyng, After be þe orifice y-bounden with a litel emplastre with o 
|P_31 
bende, so þat þe first ligature be not loused vn-to complement of incarnyng. 
Bot þe second be remoued fro þe .3.=a= day to þe .3.=a=. Comenly it 
is bounde conueniently with a ligature expressiue with ingenie .i. witte þat 
þu constreyne wiþ it & wiþ gode expressure3 bi alle þe gronde. 
 
Of þe tent douteþ many men, as Henric & my maistre of Bonoun/ þat a 
sadde tent be not put þere, for it haldeþ sanie in þe place, bot a canulate or 
a doublede / þat þe sanie may contynuelly go out. And be þer put a sponge 
vp-on þe orifice þat in sowkyng it drawe outward þe sanie. 
 
Of fistule3 in comon Capitulum .5.=m=. 
 
FIstule is an vlcere profound & cauernous wiþ a callosite, hardne3, of 
þe ynner party, of which procedeþ as often-tyme virulent sanie. 
 
And þis is þat G seid in de tumoribus preter naturam: And a fistule, 
forsoþ, is a streite & a longe sinus .i. lap or bosom like to oþer lappe3 suffryng 
contraccioun & hardne3 of þe inward partie And eft-sone3 apostasian3 .i. 
puttyng out filth for inflowyng of superfluitee3 as þai. Somtyme, forsoþ, it 
is closed & no þing putteþ out. Som tyme it is opned & putteþ out, And þat 
after þe purgacioun ysaid. And for-þi þe virulent sanie is not essensiale 
difference of it, bot þe callosite y-said wiþ fistuler fourme. 
 
Ne it agayn-stondeþ not þat maister Arnold saiþ þat als longe as þe fistuler 
sanie is aquose or glutinous or of shrewed qualitee, þe fistule duelleþ or 
abideþ quic, ffor it is not conuerted .i. turned, þat if it renne or drop not, 
þat it be extincte or quenched. 
 
Þof al he make sugestion þat as longe as þe fistule lifeþ or is quik, it may not 
be opturate .i. stopped – for þat is soþ perfitly. 
|P_32 
Bot ne þat it may be dried & closed to a tyme, And vnperfitly, trowed not G 
ne Albucasis, while3 he seiþ: And it is also in som houre3 or tyme3 puttyng 
out humidite, In som houre3, forsoþ, þe humidite is kut away fro þe sanie. 
 
Þat same helde Haly Abbas & Brune, Iamerius & 4. Maistre3. 
 
Of hardne3 of þe which henric reprehendeþ .i. reproueþ Rogerium & 
Rouland: 
 
I dout not þat ne þai vnderstode it, for þai command for to cure it with 
þinge3 consumyng hard flesh. And þe glosature3 of hem glosed þus. 
ffistule, som is in flesh, som in veyne3, Som in nerue3, Som forsoþ in 
bone3. 
 
More-ouer, som is ri3t, som oblique or croked, And som is of o lap or 
orifice & som of many. [\f. 87a\] Som is in iuncture3, Som in [{eien{], Som in þe 
cheke3, Som in þe breste, Som in þe shameful or priue place3, And so 
sewingly. 
 
Of þise difference3 is ytake pronosticacioun & curatif indicacioun. 
 
Cause3 of fistule3 beþ þo þat ar of cauernose vlcere3, for what-som-euery 
fistule þer precedeþ an vlcere cauernose & of it it spryngeþ. 
 
Bot humours þat renneþ & corrupteþ þe place ar werse in fistule3 þan in 
a cauernose vlcere. 
 
Þat materie forsoþ, is fleumatice & melancolice, as seiþ William de 
Saliceto, in which adustioun bryngeþ-to sharpne3 & venenosite. And for-þi 
said Arnold þat humidite beyng lord & frigidite suple corrupt beyng maide 
or seruaunt giffeþ life to fistule. 
 
|P_33 
Signe3 of fistule3 ar y-taken of substancialy cleuyng þinge3, as of þat callose 
skyn & of þe instrumentale fourme of þe fistule & of accident3 and effecte3, 
as of virulence and of horribilite þat som tyme renneþ fro it, And of akyng 
which is litel bot it be biside a nerue. It is signified þat it is in þe flesh: of 
grosse and viscose & trublie & crude humidite þat renneþ fro it. That if it 
be in a nerue, of akyng & þynne3 of þat goþ out fro it. That it be in þe 
veyne3, it is shewed by goyng out of blode and of fece3; þat it be in þe bone: 
of þe citrine3 and subtilite of þat þat goþ out, As putteþ Auicen. 
 
To þis helpeþ probacion3 with tente3 & probe3 & coloured wasshyng3 And 
tyme and place makeþ to þis, ffor if it be biside nerue3 & bone3, we may 
considre þat it infecteþ hem. 
 
Also þat if it passe a 3ere: þat it is in þe bone. If it do not, forsoþ: 
þat it is in þe flesh or in þe nerue. Of corrupcioun of a bone, how it is 
knowen, it is said aboue. 
 
It is demed þat þe fistule of al his kynde is of hard curacioun, most a 
profound & tortuose, inossate & antiquate, And þat haþ many concauitee3. 
Ouer þat a fistle þat is in a noble membre & nere it And þat perseþ to 
þe inward partie3, as brest & wombe & vesic, or to any of þe ribbe3 or 
spondile3 or to any of þe iuncture3, as hand & feete, it is suspecte and of yuel 
curacioun, And þe occupying in it, as seiþ Albucasis, is labor & ignorance. 
 
Cure of fistule3 haþ .2. gouernaunce3, vi3 vniuersale & particuler. Vniuersale 
haþ .3. intencion3: ffirst ordeyneþ þe life, 2.=a= auoideþ þe materie trespassyng. 
Bot þe .3.=a=, in confortyng þe inward membre3 & drying þe fistule, 
makeþ it apte to consoldyng. 
 
.1.=a= entensioun is complete wiþ gouernance ordinate after þe nature. 
 
.2.=a= is complete with þing3 auoidyng, appropriate to þe materie, of which 
|P_34 
.2. it was said plenarly y-nowe aboue in þe tretys specially of colde 
aposteme3. 
 
Bot þe .3.=a= entensioun is complete with pocion3 yproued to þe fistule, of 
which þis is more luffed to me: 
 
+R egrimonie parte3 .3., plantaginis partes .2., foliorum oliue parte 
.j; be þai kut smal & stamped & cocte wiþ white wyne, And be þer made a 
colature, of which euery day in þe mornyng be ministred a copful. Also to 
þe same: +R osmunde partes .3., genciane partes .2., centaure parte 
[{.j.{], be þai cocte with white wyne & ministred as aboue. It is, forsoþ, 
effectual in expulsioun of bone3. 
 
Gouernance particler haþ .3. or .4. entension3. ffirst makeþ large þe 
strycte orifice, .2.=a= mortifieþ & takeþ away þe fistule, .3.=a= mundifieþ þe place 
mortified. Bot þe .4.=a= incarneþ & heleþ þe place mundified. 
 
1.=a= is complete þat after þat he be wele certified of þe way & þe profoundite, 
þer be put in by þe hole a tent of þe rote of genciane or mali-terre or 
brionie or dragance or of pece3 of sponge wele tort .i. wrythen & apted, ffor 
of þe medulle of sambuc & ebuli pleseþ not to me, ffor þat in drawing out 
it is oft-tyme3 [\f. 87b\] ybroken, 3e, bot of þis I counsaile þat þe tente3 be 
bounden with a threde þat if þai cleued-to And were profounded to mych, þai 
may be drawe out wiþout fallace. And be þai made grosse and longe 
after þe quantitee of þe hole, And þat þay stonde þer by .12. houre3. 
After, forsoþ, be þe tent remoued, And if þe hole be sufficiently larged; 
þan þe first entensioun is complete. 
 
|P_35 
And þan come þe seconde, þat is to mortifien þe fistule, þe which 
seconde entencioun, forsoþ, is complete first on .3. manere3. 
 
O maner with-out inscisioun bi puttyng in of sharp þing3 & of corrosyue3. 
Anoþer maner with inscisioun & cauteri3ing. .3.=a= with inscisioun and euulcioun 
.i. pullyng out of callositee. 
 
1.=a= maner techeþ William [{to do{] with puttyng in of a tent of trocisces 
of affodille, & Rogerine with a tent of calce & of sope. or with a tent anoynted 
with arsenec, which bigileþ not. 
 
fforsoþ, if þer were diuerse cauerne3 of þe fistle, þan bihoueþ it for to 
distempere sich sharp medicyne3 with acete or wiþ som oþer liquour. And 
be þai cast in wiþ an instrument, so þat þai come to alle þe profounditee3. 
And be þe hole closed þat þai duelle or tary with-in vn-to þai haue done þair 
wirching. And þis is it þat Arnold said: a fistle tortuose & intricate is 
neuer slayne bot if it be imbibed with bitter & [{ni{]trose liquore3. To 
þis auaileþ mych stronge water of Alkemistre3, at lest þe first; fforsoþ, 
it mortifieþ & bristeþ alle fistule3. 
 
With inscisioun & cauterie is þe 2.=a= entension complete þus. þat a taste of 
tree put in vn-to þe rote of þe grounde, be al þe cauerne kut fro þe orifice 
vn-to þe grounde in þe maner as is said aboue of wonde3 & vlcere3 ca[{r{]nose 
& cauernose. And als sone be yt preperate for þe flux wiþ white of egg3 
And tente3 dilatyng þe lippe3 of þe vlcere. 
 
|P_36 
And after in þe morne be þe place cauteri3ed with a cauterie actuale or 
potenciale made of puluer of affodille3 or arsenec. 
 
Auicen, forsoþ, doþ þis with quic-syluer sublymed, so þat no þing corrupt 
& callose ne out of kynde abide stille in þe vlcere, þat ne it be dried & cast out 
& consumed. And in þe circuite, as is said, be euermore put colde þinge3. 
How, forsoþ, a corrupt bone is reparailed, it was said aboue. 
 
Signe, forsoþ, þat þe sharp medicyne3 haþ perfourmed her worching is 
tumefaccioun, bolnyng, of þe vlcer, as seiþ Rogerine. And as vse haþ, þe 
abidyng or [{t{]arying of .3. daie3. When, forsoþ, þe fistule is cauteri3ed & 
dried, be it socoured with a medecene mitigatyue, as is in þe first daie3 oile 
wiþ egge3, after wiþ butir or wiþ an oþer vnctuose þing vn-to þe fire & þe 
escare falle And it be turned in-to sanie. 
 
When, forsoþ, þe sanie þat first was indigeste goþ out digeste & 
minorate .i. lessed, it is signe þat þe fistule is mortified. 
 
And þis said Arnold wele: 
 
Of what-so-euery party of it þe fistule put out sanie pure & perfite, þer is 
now þe fistle quenched. 
 
Wiþ inscision wiþout Cauterie is þis seconde entension complete, þat þe 
inscisioun y-done or made vn-to þe grounde, as is said, be þer y-take away wiþ a 
Rasour al þe flesh in þe circuite, callose & putrefied, so þat þe place lefe pure 
or clene, which shal shewe bi presence of gode flesh, as seiþ Auicen. And þis 
is þe verray mortifying & curyng of þe fistule. 
 
And if it be not cured by þise manere3, it is remitted to seint Eligie, as seiþ 
folke. 
 
Not agaynstondyng þat Lamfranc promitteþ for to cure it wiþ egrimonie & 
salt, which, neþerle3, I haue not founden in wirching, And if it be founden in 
cauernose vlcere3, which Auicen seiþ recent fistle3, It was yno3 also þat it 
|P_37 
war gedred with þe pater noster. And þus is complete þe seconde 
entensioun. 
 
Bot þe .3.=a=, which is for to mundifye þe place, [\f. 88a\] & þe .4.=a= which is 
for to incarne & hele þe place mundified, ar complete as is nowe said of oþer 
cauernose vlcere3. Cure. Of cure palliatif. When, forsoþ, þe fistule is in 
sich a place þat it may not be cured, as when it is in hi3 membre3 & in 
ny3ne3 of nerue3 or of veyne3, Or if þe sikeman is feble and may not suffre 
payne, or for drede it is more declynyng þat þe sikene3 abide stille wiþ hym, Or 
parauentour þat bi cure of it shulde folow a wers sikene3, as in fistule3 of 
longaon, vnwilful goyng out of fece3, þan is it necessarye for to palliate yt 
with diete & purgacioun & turnyng of þe materie to a partie lesse noble & for to 
mundifie it of fraudulent flesh & vnctuose, fatte. After be yt replete wiþ 
homely exsiccatyue3 & be it couered wiþ diapalma or emplaster nigre, for it 
shal duelle quiete long tyme, alonly þat it be eschewed fro water & fro 
dolorous site & fro laborous mouyng. 
 
And þis palliatif putteþ Auicen, And Arnold gaf reson vp-on it while he 
said: vnnaturale way, þat while3 it goþ out or droppe, as in fistule3 antiquate 
.i. old, may not be stopped wiþ-out þe drede of a more greuous harme or 
vnese, bot if þat þe custumable goyng out or droppyng be deriuate to þe nexte 
plas. Of cancer vlcerate Capitulum .6.=m=. 
 
CAncer vlcerate is an vlcere apperyng or shewyng round, horrible, stynkyng, 
wiþ lippe3 grosse & knotty, inuersed, raised vp and cauernose, hauyng a colour 
liuide .i. bloo & derke & in þe circuite veyne3 ful of melancolious blode. 
And it semeþ after Auicen þat it is named Cancer for one of .2. þinge3: 
Ouþer for his tenacite .i. holdyng wiþ þe membre, as holding of þe Cancer .i. 
crabbe with þat þing þat it honteth or takeþ, Or for his fourme, for it is 
|P_38 
rounde and putteþ oute veyne3 in þe circuite þat ar as feete of þe Cancer 
.i. crabbe. And it hath derke colour as a crabbe. And henric saiþ þat in 
corrodyng it goþ about as þat fish. 
 
Spice3 & difference3 of a cancre ar y-take of .3. þinge3: Of beyng of þe 
sikene3, Of þe materie of which þai ar made, And of þe nature of þe membre3. 
By þe first is it said þat Cancre, som is soft, litel, not mych akyng. Anoþer is 
grete & violent & of huge or grete aking. 
 
Bi þe 2.=a= is it said þat som is of melancolie aduste of [{it self, Som of 
melencolye aduste of{] oþer humore3, most of colre aduste of oþer humours. 
 
Bi þe .3.=a= it is said þat som is in symple membre3, as in flesh, veyne3, 
nerue3 & bone3, Som componed, as in þe face, which comenly is called noly 
me tangere, In þe thie3 lupus, in midde3 of þe body singulus, as said 
Rogerine. Not agaynstondyng þat Brune & thederic seiþ þat none of olde 
men named hem so. Cause3. Cancer vlcerate is caused of one not vlcerate 
And of vlcere3 angred or prouoked & vnwisely cured. 
 
Of cancre not vlcerate is caused a cancre vlcerate in kuttyng it, as was said 
aboue in þe cancre of melancolious aposteme3. 
 
Of vlcere3 & wonde3 is caused a Cancre when þat for angryng or 
prouoking wiþ sharp þinge3 ar shrewed melancolious humour3 adust & 
moued, & þai flowe & ar drawen of al þe body & of ny3 membre3 in þe place, 
and þai ar putrefied & chaufed & þai gete sharpne3 & venemoustee, of which 
is gendred & eked an yuel disposicioun & is made a Cancre. 
 
Cause3 primityue3, forsoþ, may moue þe antecedent3, And of hem ar 
made þe coniuncte, as often-tyme3 is said. 
|P_39 
Signe3 of cancre ar taken of þinge3 substancialy cleuyng-in, as of þe hard 
substaunce of þe lippe3 & of þe vlcere, of figure brode & rounde, cauernose & 
reuersed, And of effecte3 & þing3 accidently cleuyng-in. as of virulence 
horrible & stynching, sich þat it may no3t [\f. 88b\] be noted bi scripture, bot þai 
þat haþ vsed it alsone fro fer parceyueþ it. And with þis, if it be wasshed 
with lexiue, lye, it is made cinerous .i. asshi & viscose. And 
ouer þat it is angred & prouoked with litel corrosiue3, And þe malice of it 
augmented, as putteþ Lamfranc & Henric. 
 
Of cancre vlcerate is demed þat was demed aboue of þe not vlcerate. 
And ouer þat it is said þat þe long lastyng of it & perseuerance argueþ þe malice 
& þe grete difficulte of it. And for þis said Albucasis þat when it is olde and 
is grete, it bihoueþ not þat þer come ou3t nere to it. 
 
fforsoþ, as he said, y cured no man, Ne I sawe no man bi-fore me þat 
come to þat. And for-þi G in comento Quibuscumque &c in .6.=o= Amphorismorum 
seiþ þat þu cure not þe cancre bot at grete instance at requiryng. 
 
More-ouer, þe cancre þat is olde & habituate in a membre And þat is 
infiltrate in veyne3, nerue3 and bone3 And þat is hid & profounded in þe 
innermore membre3 And þat is in a place wher it may not be comprehended 
And þat is in a feble persoun & dredful, it is better þat it be palliate þan if it 
were cured. 
 
Þai þat ar cured, forsoþ, persheþ more sone, Not cured and palliate 
perfourmeþ mych tyme, as was aleged in .6=o= amphorismorum/ in þe capitle of 
cancre not vlcerate. And for-þi said Auicen þis meruelous þing. þat of an 
vlcerate was made somtyme a not vlcerate, ffor if it be cured in o place; it is 
often-tyme3 changed in a noþer. 
 
At last demeþ William de Saliceto þat a cancre is a dangerous sikene3, for 
how mych more þat it is groped or feled, þe more it is endigned or dedeyned, 
where he counsaileþ þat it be not touched bot softly. And for þis it is 
|P_40 
called noli me tangere. Cure. Cure of cancer vlcerate haþ 2. gouernance3 
vi3 vniuersale & particler.
