[\Lambeth Palace MS. 523\] 
 
[\f. 85v\] ffleumaticus: 
SLuggy & slowe, in spetynge muiche, 
Cold & moyst, my natur ys suche; 
Dull of wit, & fatt, of contnaunc strange, 
fflewmatyke, þis complecion may not change. 
|P_72 
Sanguineus: 
Delyberall Y am, lowynge and gladde, 
laghynge & playynge, full seld y am sad; 
Syngynge, full fayr of collour, bold to fyght, 
hote & moyst, benynge, sanguine y hyght. 
 
Colericus: 
I am sad & soleynge with hewynes in thoght; 
I cowet ryght muiche, leue wyll y noght; 
ffraudulent & suttyll, full cold & dry, 
Yollowe of collour, colloryke am y.

[}[\77. The Complexions, II\]}] 
[\Harley MS. 2251\] 
 
[\f. 79r\] Sanguineus: 
OFf yiftes large, in love hath grete delite, 
Iocunde and gladde, ay of laughyng chiere, 
Of ruddy colour meynt somdel with white; 
Disposed by kynde to be a champioun, 
Hardy I-nough, manly, and bold of chiere. 
Of the sangwyne also it is a signe, 
To be demure, rigth curteys, and benynge. 
 
Colericus: 
The Coleryk: froward and of disceyte, 
Irous in hert, prodigal in expence, 
Hardy also, and worchith ay by sleyght. 
Sklendre and smalle, ful light in existence, 
|P_73 
Right drye of nature for the grete fervence 
Of heete; and the coleryk hath this signe, 
He is comunely of colour cytryne. 
 
[\f. 79v\] fflevmaticus: 
The fflewmatyk is sompnelent and slowe, 
With humours grosse, replete, ay habundaunt, 
To spitte Invenons the flewmatik is knowe, 
By dulle conceyte and voyde, vnsufficiaunt 
The sutill art to complice or haunt; 
ffatt of kynde, the flewmous, men may trace, 
And know hym best by whitnes of his face. 
 
Malencolicus: 
The Malencolius thus men espye: 
He is thought and sette in covetise, 
Replenysshith full fo fretyng envye; 
His hert servith hym to spende in no wise, 
Trayterous frawde full wele can he devise; 
Coward of kynde whan he shuld be a man, 
Thow shalt hym knowe by visage pale and wan. 
 
[}[\78. Lydgate's Dietary\]}] 
[\MS. Rawlinson C. 86\] 
 
[\f. 61r\] FFor helth of body, couere for colde þyn hede; 
Ete no rawe mete, take good hede þerto, 
Drynke holsom wyne, fede þe on lyghte brede, 
With an apitite rise from þy mete also; 
With women agid, flesshely haue not A-doo; 
Vppon þy slepe, drynke not of þe cuppe; 
Gladde toward bedde and at morwe boþe to; 
And Vse neuer late for to supppe. 
|P_74 
And yf so be þat leches do þe fayle, 
Thanne take good hede to Vse þynges thre - 
Temperat dyet, temperat traveyle; 
Not malincolius for non aduersite, 
Meke in troubill, glad in pouerte, 
Ryche with litell, content with suffisaunce, 
Neuer grucchyng, but mery lyke þy degre; 
Yf physike lakke, make þis þy gouernaunce. 
 
To euery tale, sonn, gyff not credence; 
Be not hasty nor sodenly vengeabill, 
To poure folke do no violence, 
Curteys of langage; of fedyng mesurabyll, 
On sondry metis not gredy at þe tabill, 
In feding gentill; prudent in daliaunce; 
Close of tunge, of worde not deceyuabill, 
To sey þe best sette al-wey þy plesaunce. 
 
Haue in hate mowthes þat ben doubill, 
Suffir at þy tabill neuer detraccioun, 
[\f. 61v\] Haue despite of folke þat ben trouble, 
Of fals rowners and adulacioun; 
Within þy court suffir no devisioun, 
Whych in þyn houshold shulde cause gret excesse; 
Of all welfare, prosperite, and fusoun, 
With þy neyghbours lyve in reste and pease. 
 
Be clenly clad aftyr thyne estate; 
Passe not þy bondys, kepe þy promisse blyve, 
With thre folkes be not at debate - 
ffirst with thy bettir beware for to strive, 
 
|P_75 
A-geyne þy felawe no quarell do contive, 
With þy soget to striue it were shame; 
Wherfor I counsell pursue all þy lyve 
To lyve in pease and gete þe A good name. 
 
ffyre at morwe and toward bedde at euen, 
A-geyne mystys blake and eyre of pestelens; 
Be-tyme at masse, þou shalt þe better cheve; 
ffirste at þy rysing do to god reuerence; 
Visite þe pore with intere diligence, 
On all nedy haue compassioun, 
And god shall send grace and influence 
The to encrese and þy possesioun. 
 
Suffir no surfetis in þyn house at nyght, 
Ware of rere-soupers and of gret excesse, 
Of noddyng hedis and of candel lyght, 
Of slougth on morow and slombryng ydelnesse, 
Whyche of all vices is chef portresse; 
[\f. 62r\] Woyde all dronkelawe, lyers, and lechours; 
Of all Vnthryfty exile þe mastresse, 
That is to sey, dyse pleyers and hasardours. 
 
Aftir mete be-ware make no long slepe; 
Hede, fote, and stomake preserue aye from colde; 
Be not to pensife, of thowth take no kepe, 
Aftir þyn Rente mayntayne þyn housholde; 
Suffir in tyme, in þy Ryght be bolde, 
Swere no othyes no man to begyle, 
In youthe be lusty, sad whanne þou art olde - 
No worldely Ioye laste but A whyle. 
|P_76 
Dyne not at morow Afore þyn appetyte - 
Clere ayre & walkyng maketh good digestioun; 
Betwene mealys drynke not for no froward delyte, 
But thurste or traveyle geve þe occasioun; 
Ouer-salte metys do gret oppressioun 
To febill stomakys whanne þey cannot refrayn 
ffro þynges contrarie to her complexioun; 
Of gredy handis þe stomake hath grete payn. 
 
Thus in two þinges standith all þe welth 
Of soule and of body, whoso hem sue, 
Moderat fode gevyth to man his helth, 
And all surfetys doth from him remewe; 
And charite to þe soule is due, 
This resceyte bought is at no poticarye, 
Of master Antony nor of master hewe, 
To all indifferent þe rycheste dietarye.

By touche of poues & vryne Inspections.

[\Huntington MS. HU 1051\] 
 
[\f. 85r\] IUce of lekes with gotes galle 
For evyl herynge help it shalle. 
Too partes of the Iuce, the third of galle, 
Mellyd smal, and warme with-alle. 
In noise or eyr where it be do, 
For grete hedewark wel it slo; 
Brokyn bonys wil it knyt, 
And angrey sorys wille it flyt. 
Lekes & salt same done, 
Helpys a woman to clooe son. 
It is gud for dronkyn men 
A raw lek to ete, & comfortyth the brayn. 
 
[}[\81. Directions for Bloodletting\]}] 
[\MS. Arch. Selden supra 73\] 
 
[\f. 25r\] MAistres! ye that vsen blode-lettynge, 
And therby geten youre lyuynge; 
Here May ye lerne wysdome goode, 
What plase that ye shall letten blode 
In man and in childe, 
ffor euelles that ben wyked & wyld. 
Veynes þer ben thirty and ij 
ffor euelles many moste be vndo; 
Sextene in the hede full Ri3tt, 
And sextene be-nethe, as I yowe pli3t. 
|P_78 
In what place þei shall be founde 
I shall yowe tell at this stounde. 
Be-side the Ere there ben ij 
That on A childe mote be vndo 
To kepe his hede fro euell-turnynge, 
And fro scall withouten lesynge. 
ij at the temples ther most blede 
ffor Stoppynge and Akynge, I Rede; 
[\f. 25v\] and i is in the myd forehed 
ffor lepre and sausfleme þat moste blede. 
Aboue the nose forsoth is i

ij ther ben at the eyen ende 
Yf þou be blered, hem to Amende, 
And for web þat comyth þorowe smokynge. 
I yowe tell, no maner lesynge, 
At the hole of the þrote ther ben ij 
That lepre and strayte breth will vndo. 
In the lippes foure þer ben 
Goode to blede, I tell the:

As I the tell þer ben so,

And whan hit is flayne, as I Rede;

Must bledyne for the Sqynsye, 
And whan the tonge is ought akynge, 
And for euery maner Swellynge. 
Nowe I haue tolde of the Sextene 
That longen for the hed, as I wene. 
Of as many nowe I will Saye 
That elles-where ben in faye. 
|P_79 
In euery Arme ther ben fyf 
fful goode to bleden for man and wyfe. 
Cephalica is i, I-wys, 
The hed-veyne cleped he is; 
The body abouen and the hed 
He clensith well from euery qued. 
In the byhte of the Arme Also

Basilica his name is, 
Lowist he sittith þer, I-wys; 
fforthe he clensythe the lyuer A-Ry3tt, 
And al odir membres benethe as ty3tt. 
[\f. 26r\] The myd be-tuyx þe [\veynes\] ij

That veyne clensith withouten doute 
Abouen, be-nethen, within and with-oute. 
ffro basilica, as I of told, 
A Branched veyne goth full bolde; 
To the thombe gothe that branche - 
The Cardiacle hit will staunch. 
The toþer bravnch full Ry3t he goth 
To the littill fynger, with-outen othe - 
Salue stella is his name; 
He is A vayne of nobill fame; 
Ther is no veyne þat clensith so clene 
Stoppynge of lyuer and of Splene. 
Aboue the knokelles on the fete 
With ij veynes there þou may mete: 
Within sittith domestica, 
And withouten Siluatica. 
Domestica clensith well 
The bleddir within euery dell. 
|P_80 
Siluatica, withouten do3te, 
He clensith well frome the govte. 
In the hammes A woman shall blede 
ffor stoppynge of her flawres at nede. 
A man shall bleden þer also 
The emeraudes to for-do. 
The veynes yf þou vse, I saye, 
The quarteyne þou may voyde Awaye. 
All þe veynes I haue nowe tolde 
That clensen men, both yonge & olde. 
Yf þou þis vse at þi nede,

So þat þe lord be helpyng, 
That all thyng hath in gouernynge. 
So mote hit be, sey nowe we, 
Amen, Amen, for charite!
