[^CANUTUS, PLAGUE TREATISE^] 
 
|P_270 
[\f. 282v\] In the worshyppe of the blessyd and indiuide Trinite 
and the gloriouse Virgin Marie, and the profitte of the halle Cristen 
peple, and for to preseruyng the helth [{of them{] that be hoole, 
and for the refformacion of them that be seke, Y wyl declare 
summe thynges of pestilence, the whiche often tymes douth fallow 
vs, and be the seyng of autentiks phisycions Y porpose to writte 
and declare; and ffurste, the tokenys of ys pronosticacions; the 
secunde, the causes why; the iijd=de=, the remedijs therffore; the iiij=te=, 
ffor the confortyng of the hert & the principale membris; the 5=te= & 
the laste, of ffleubotomia, i. to-drawyng of blode. 
 
The tokens of pestilence of the pronosticacion be vij=en=, the 
whiche ffurdewith you shal haue kenowliche. The ffurste [\f. 283\] 
ys whan in a sommer day, the aer often tymes chyaunge, as in the 
mornyng yt appyereth as yt wolde raen, then after yt ys cloudy, 
and after wyndy, and namely of sowthern wynde. The ij=de= token ys 
whan often tyme in summer the days sheod derke, as yt wil raen & 
raen not, & yf thys contynue longe, yt ys for to drede of gret 
pestilence. The iij=de= token ys whan yt appyereth many fflyes vpon 
the yerth, and þis betokeneth that the aer ys enffect & venemouse. 
The iiij=or= token ys whan the sterrys often tymes yt symeth that they 
falle adoun, & also yt ys a token that the aer ys enffect, & that 
many venemouse vapours be in the aer. The 5=te= token hys whan 
|P_271 
you sye the Sterre Cometta, yt symeth that yt dow fflye, and as yt 
ys hade in Methauris, þis fortuned whan the Cometta Sterre [\f. 283v\] 
dow scheow, yt ys a token of mens deth in battelys, etcetera. 
Vnde this verse: 
 
Mors furit, urbs rapitur, 
Seuit mare, sol operitur, 
Regnum mutatur, plebs peste fame cruciatur. 
 
Th' vj=te= token ys whan moche lyttyngs & tounderyng beth, and 
namely whan yt cummeth on the south syde. The vij=en= token ys 
whane moche wynde & ventosite cumme of þe south syde, ffor 
they be stynkyng & vnclenly they be. Wher whan thys token 
appyereth, yt ys to be drede of gret pestilence, but almyghty God 
of his gret pite wyl holde ys graciouse handes ouer vs and taket & 
remeuyd awey. 
 
[}The causes of pestilence}] 
The cause of pestilence, yt cumme be iij maner wyse, for 
summe tyme yt cumme of the rottys in the loer partes, and summe 
tyme of the rottys of the hyere partys, so that sensuali yt dow [\f. 284\] 
appyereth vnto vs the chyangyng of the aer, and summe tyme 
yt cumme of bothe, as for to say of the vpper rotte & the loer 
togiders. 
 
And as for the rotte in the loer partys, as we may sye be ys 
segge, or ellys of any other thynge particulare that corrumpe the 
aer in substance and in qualite, and yt ys particulare, & thys may 
cumme every day. Wher of that procede the ffyeuers pestilencials, 
where aboute many physycyens be deceuyd, that suche ffyeuer 
they belleue not that [{yt{] ys pestilence ffyueuers. And summe tyme 
yt commeth of the aer of dede bodyes that be stynkyng, or ellys be 
|P_272 
corrupcyon of stynkyng dyches & watters, [{as yt{] fortune often 
tymes in corrupte places, and thys ys summe tyme vniuersale & 
summe tyme particular. 
 
And atte rotte aboue: hyt haþe the vertue of the celestial bodyes, 
the whiche þe spirite animal be corrumped in hymselff, and of this 
speke Avicenna, [\f. 284v\] the iiij=te= boke. Be the forme of the ffyrmament 
lyttelly the bodyes be enffect, ffor the impression of the 
ffyrmament the aer douth corrumpe, and so the spirite be enffecte 
in man, and of thys seyde Avicenna in the iiij=te= boke. Of the forme 
of the firmament, the bodyes likely be infectted, ffor the impression 
of the ffirmament corrumpe the aer, and so the spiritte dow 
corrumpe in man. 
 
And frome the vppermeste rotte vnto the lowest: þei cumme 
togeders whan the impression of the firmamente corrumpe the aer, 
and the stynkyng of the ded & rotten bestes, or men that be ded & 
stynkyng, and suche morbe cause summe tyme a ffyeure, & 
summe tyme apostume, and this fortune often tymes in many 
men. And the aer summe tyme ys enspired with venime & corupte, 
the whiche hurt the hert, so that nature ys agreued so moche 
that sche fylle not her greuance, for yt ys so feruent. 
 
[\f.285\] And summe tyme the vrines in sycht, they appyereth 
of good dygestions, yt for halle that, the pacyent yt pretendyth to 
deth, wher many phisycions that loke & haue respite in vrines, 
superficiale they speke, & so deceue þe pacyent. Wher necessarye 
ys that euery seke man to poruey himself of a good & expert 
physycyon. 
 
But ij=en= questions ys meued in this case: what ys the cause that 
on dye & the tother not, and in summe tovne the[{r{] deyd men and 
in another not? The secunde question beth wheter this morbes 
pestilencial be contagius? 
 
Atte furste Y do say that this may fortune of ij=en= maner of 
causes, i. of the parte that cumme of, & of the parte of the pacient. 
And of the parte that yt cumme of, the influence supercelestiale 
more directly haue a regarde to thys man or that man, & in that 
place [{or this place{]. But of the parte of the pacient, for he ys more 
|P_273 
dysposite to deth then tother, wher [\f. 285v\] yt ys to vnderstande 
that the bodyes be more dysposyd that be hotte, hauyng gret 
poorys, [{than{] the body enffect, hauyng also the poorys stopyd 
wyth moche humors. Wher also the bodyes that haue gret resolucion, 
as men that spare no lecherye, & they [{that{] vse bathes, & 
them that swette with labour or be gret wreth, thys bodyes be more 
dyspossyd to the morbe pestilencial. 
 
And to the ij=de= question, that suche morbes pestilencial be contagius: 
for cause that the bodyes þat be infected, the humors cumme 
out of there bodyes & enffect them that be clene of complessyon. 
Wherffore yt ys goode to voyde the aer of them that be enffected. 
Also, in the tyme of pestilence hyt ys no good nor holsum to be 
amonge gret multitude of people, for yt may be amonge them 
summe that be enffected. Of the whiche reson the prudent physycion 
whan he 
[\next folio missing, text supplied from Machilinia’s printed version (c. 1486)\] 
[{wyse physicyens in visityng 
seke folke stande ferre fro the pacient, holdyng their face toward 
the doore or wyndowe, and so sholde the seruaunts of seke folke 
stande. 
 
Also, it is gode to a pacient euery day for to chaunge his chambre, 
& often times to haue the wyndowes opene ayenst the north 
and eest and to spere the wyndowes ayenst the south, for the south 
wynd hath ij causes of putrifaction. The first is, it maketh a man, 
beyng hole or seke, feble in their bodyes. The seconde cause is as it 
is writon in the iij of Amphorismys: the south wynde greuyth the 
heeryng & hurteth the herte, by cause it openeth the poores of man 
& entreth into the herte. Wherfore it is gode to an hole man in 
tyme of pestilence, whan the wynd is in the south, to bee within the 
hous al daye, & yf it schal be nede a man to goo oute, yet lete hym 
abide in hys hous tyl the sonne be vp in the eest, passyng 
southward. 
 
[}Here after folowen the remedies for the pestylence}] 
Now it is to wete by what remedies a man may preserue himselfe 
fro pestilence. First, see the writing of Jeremy the prophete, 
that a man ought to forsake euyl thinges & doo gode dedes & 
|P_274 
mekely to confesse his sinnes. For why it is the hyest remedie in 
time of pestilence, penaunce & confession to be preferred al other 
medicynes. 
 
Neuerthelesse, I promitte you verely it is a gode remedye to 
voyde and chaunge th'ynfect place. But somme may not proufitably 
chaunge theire places. Therfore, as moche as to them is 
possible it is to eschewe euery cause of putrifaccion and stynking, 
and namely euery fleschly lust with wymmen is to be eschewed, 
also the sothern wynde, whiche wynde is naturelly infectyf. Ther-fore{] 
[\f. 286\] let the wyndows be ffasted shettyt, as yt ys seyde 
byfore, towarde the south, tyl yt be on atte cloke, & then open ys 
wyndows towarde the north. 
 
And in like wyse to exchew halle euyl aers, as to say in stabulys, 
ffyldys, & strettys, & namely the heer of bestys that sodenly dye & 
be stynkyng, and also þe aer of stynkyng watters, ffor in summe 
housses they kyepe [{water{] ij or iij days and nyghtes, & [{yt{] falle in 
the grounde and sprede & synked doun, & theer yt douth rotted, 
the whiche cause grett stynche. And this ys the cause that summe 
dye in suche a place, wher suche thynge fortuned, and in another 
place dow not, as yt ys seyd byfore. 
 
Also, in lyke wyse wher potages & worttes be sheded in corners 
& rotted, & yt cause euyl aers, wher-as swytte odours & odoriffer 
spyces conforte & relyue þe hert & the spirits. 
 
In like wyse the evil eerys & stynkyng yt make them [\f. 286v\] 
weke, quer yt ys holsumme that the housse be kepet cleen, that no 
enffect aer cumme in, nor noryshed inne, nother of moystenes & 
putrefyynge stinkyng matters, and speciali in the place wher a man 
shal take ys reste. Wher let the place [{be made{] with fumigacions of 
swytte tryys to expulse the euyl aers. Also, a fumigacion be hadde 
with swytte herbes, as it ys wrytten, as the bays of laurus, jenuper, 
and vberiorgani, whiche you shal haue at te potekarijs, & warmode, 
ysope, rue, mugwortte, ligni aloes, that ys best, but for a 
llittyl price yt may not be compared. And suche smoche let be 
receuyd atte mouth & atte nostrilles, & so yt wil ratteffye the 
inwarde. 
|P_275 
Another thynge also, let him beware of any replexion of mettys 
& superfluites, for them that be replitte, the sonner they be enffected, 
wher Avicenna seyde in þe iiij=te= Canon that they that continualy 
[\f. 287\] fylle there bodyes with replexion of mettys, they shal 
falle in the ffyeuer periodica and shortte ther lyues. And also in 
this cause, let them beware of bathes, for a llityl ferment do corrupte 
halle the body. Wher, fynyaly, any body let beware of any 
multitude of people, leste that be the breth off summe of them may 
be enffect. 
 
But whan yt may not be that euery man fflye frome place to place 
for ferre & drede, then let them vse this remedijs that followith: 
ffurste, in the mornyng whan you dow arisse, let hym take a 
llittyl rew wel-washed in clene watter & with a llittyl salte, and with 
on or ij=en= of wallenuttys wel-ypyked, and yf so be that he may not 
haue this, then let him haue a toste, or ellys bred puttet in vinegre, 
& namely thys in a trubulde wether, or cloudy. 
 
Also, in the pestilencial sesson, yt his better to kyepe hys housse 
then walke oute, for yt ys not holsum to labour in no citees nor 
villages. 
 
Also, [\f. 287v\] let the housses be sparkeld, & namely 
in sommer-tyme, with vinegre & rossys & leuys of the vynnes. 
 
And also yt ys good for to washe be day ther handes often tymes 
with watter & vinegre, and therwith to put ys handes to hys face & 
to his nose & smylle therto. 
 
Also, yt ys good, as wel in summer as in wynter, to smylle to 
sharpe thynges, as vinegre or suche others. And in the Mounte 
Pessulano Y coude not avoyde the communalte, for Y went frome 
place to place to cure seke men be cause of my pouerte. Wher Y 
toke a sponge, or ellys brede put in vinegre, and bared with me, 
puttyng to my nose & to my mouth, for why halle maner of 
shyarpe lycours as vinegre & suche others, they stoppe the weys of 
the humors & cause that venemouse thynges shalle not entre in. 
And be this maner meanys Y schaped frome pestilence, wher 
myne ovne falloshype hade no belleue but Y [\f. 288\] shulde dye. 
And halle thys remedijs Y pryued be myselff. 
 
[}For the conffortatiuys of the hertte & of halle other membris}] 
The confortatyuys of the hert be this: saffron, cassiafistula, 
planteyn, with other herbes, the whiche dow arryer the spirit 
|P_276 
inwarde, and thys namely yt ys in the wlgare tounge, that be 
likelyhode that on shulde be enffecte of another. Wherfore grettely 
yt ys to beware that no man shale take no breth of another. Also, 
let them beware whan the skye ys derky & enffecte to loke 
vpwarde, but yt haue that sponge in vinegre, as yt ys reherssyd 
byffore. Also, yt ys holsum to be washed the mouth & the eyus & 
the handes often tymes in the day with rosse watter, mengeld with 
a llittyl vinegre. And yf yt may not halle thys ingredience be hade, 
then let be down with vinegre aloon, then you shal go seurly 
amonge halle people or in any cite. 
 
Also, they haue for a gret remedye to [\f. 288v\] yeue them a 
laxse, ffor yf yt cumme not naturali, let be prouoked artefficialj 
with suppositorijs. Also be good the pillettys pestillencials, the 
whiche you shal hauet yt vnto the apothecarijs, and also let fyre 
be kepte in the housse, for grettely yt do lette the impression of the 
aere & clareffye the aer. 
 
And as for medecines specialj, Y dow say that tyriacle ys very 
profitable, as wel to them that be in good helth as vnto them that 
be enffecte. Wherffore let be receuyd ij=en= tymes a day with clere 
wyn & wel-smyllyng, or ellys with clere watter of rosses, or ellys 
with clere good alle with tiriacle, but only the quantite of a peese 
atte ons, and of the win, watter, or good halle, the quantite of ij=en= 
sponne fulle, and the tyriacle let not be vtterly dyssoluyd. And let 
hym ette no mette tyl be xij=e= a clo[{ck{], that the tyriacle may haue 
here operacion. 
 
Also, yt ys good to ette mettys with fyne wyn [\f. 289\] & peure 
often times in a day, & a llittil, for moche habundance caused 
putreffyyng of the humors. 
 
And let them bewar of halle maner of mettys that be chyaffyng, 
i. hotte mettys, as peper, garlike, how so be that peper purge the 
braen of fleume & the spiritual membris of viscouse humors, how 
|P_277 
so be also that grettely yt do calleffye, & heet cause putreffacion, 
and yt ys more to sye the bitternesse only, & the sauour ys plesaunt. 
Garlike also, how so be that ys a purger of fleume, & put 
oute euyl humors, yt do prouoke appettit to ette. 
 
And let that the drye eere shal not entre, but yt douth trubull 
the syght & the hede of any man that occupye him to moche, wher 
he do calleffye, & therffore yt symeth not good. 
 
Pestilence often times do encresse be hotte causes, wherof halle 
maner of mettys, the more that they be likte, they make dygestion, 
& thoo be better. And in the mornyng let hym vse soden mettys, 
and atte nyght roste mettys. And [\f. 289v\] bewar of brothes & 
pottages, but thay be shyarped with vinegre or with summe other 
sausse. For in the pestilence sesson, halle maner of mettys that [{be{] 
shyarpe, & medecynes also, be good. 
 
Also, let them beware of halle maner of fruyttys, but they be 
sharpe & acetouse, as be cherise, pomegarnades, & a llitil of a pere 
or of an apulle, in stede of medecines, how so be that halle maner 
of ffruyttes gender putrifficacion. 
 
And of spyces communly ys gynger, cinamoum, comin, masses, 
sapharon, and thys ys good for riche people. And for power peple, 
take rew, sauge, wallenuttes, persely, & mengeld with vinegre 
togiders, and thys ys a goude sawse. And yf they be bethwyxt 
bothe, nother poer nor riche, take comin & sapharon & mengel 
togiders with vinegre, & this sawse ys good, & destrue halle maner 
of putreffacyons. 
 
Another also, to be mery in his hertte yt ys a gret remedye for 
helth of the body. Also, another yt [\f. 290\] ys, that in the time of 
pestilence you shulde not be afferde, but caste halle maner of 
fantasyes away, and ette & drinke mesurabely with a glade & mery 
hertte, hoppyng & trustyng in God to lyve lenger. 
 
[}De fleubotomia, i. for drawyng of bloude}] 
To draw blod ons in a month yt may be doune, but age or any 
other suche thynge douth sheow, as to say in women that be with 
|P_278 
chylderns, or in a fyebel man, or in them that haue the fluxse of 
the bely. 
 
Wher make your ffleubotomye in the basilica vayne in the 
ryght or in the lefte sythes byfore dyner tyme, and whan yt ys 
drawe the blod, let hym be mery & iocunde, & let him drinke good 
wyn or ellys good alle, & nameli temperately. 
 
And yt ys not for to slepe that day þat the basilica vayne ys 
kuttet, & yf any man ffynde him agreuyd, & enfect, & scheowyng 
the boche outwarde in any wyse, let him be ware of slepe, & let [\f. 290v\] 
him be walkyng, because in the slepe the heet inwarde prouoke 
venyme to the hert & vnto halle other spiritual membris, in 
suche wyse that [{ther{] ys no maner of herbes that hade poer to put 
away that venime, & to brynge in þat case as yt was byfore, & this 
wyl not fortuned, yf the paycent ware walkyng & sterryng. 
 
And summe wil aske the question why that he shal not slepe yf 
yt hade a natural slepe, and in thys case Y wyl answer shorttely 
that in þe pestilence sesson, anon after met, yf he haue luste to 
slepe, then that luste moste be reuoked for a sesson, other in the 
gardynes or in the ffyldes, and then the slepe natural may cumme, 
the space of an hore after dyner. 
 
Wher Avycenna do sey that yf the man wyle slepe, he shulde 
drynke a draught of good wyn or he goth to slepe, for whan a man 
beyng aslepe, yt drawyth many humors [{and the euyl humours{] be 
expelled be the humors of that draught of drinke byfore. 
 
[\f. 291\] And yff a man asked a question, how and in what wyse 
a man shal kenow himself whan he his enffect, to this Y wyl yeue 
an answer that a man that ys enffect, that same day he wyl ette no 
moche met, for why [{he{] ys replytte of euyl humors, & after met he 
haue grette luste to slepe, & gret heet vnder colde he dow ffylleth. 
 
Also, he suffre gret payne in the fforhede, but halle this wyl 
reuoke for a space [{be moeuyng{] hyer & theer, and ffor to ryde & 
to goo he may not ffor the gret vnlustenesse of the body & 
heuynesse. 
|P_279 
And the man that ys enffect, euery hore yt as luste to slepe, for 
cause þat the venyme inwarde trubule the spyrit vitale in suche 
wyse that euer they pretende to slepe & haue reste, & be this tokens 
a man shal ffynde hymselff enffect, and yf so be that no man wyl 
belleuyd, let hem tarye halff a day, & anon he shal fylle the boche 
abut other vnder his harmes, or ellys abut the shyarre, or abutte 
the eerys. 
 
[\f. 291v\] Wher yt ys a gret remedye, he þat fylleth halle the 
forsayde tokens in þe tyme of pestilence, let hym beware of sleppyng, 
ffor as yt ys kenown in the forsaide, yt appyereth in slepe, 
and the spirite vitale take reste, how so be that he caste his venime 
and sparkeld in every membre hyere & theer. And halle this Y 
haue pryued be myselff. 
 
And halle thoo that stande in suche a case, whan he ffynde 
hymselff so enffect, as sovne as yt may be that same day, let be 
mynuyshe of blod in good quantite, tyl yt cumme almoste to a 
sondyng, ffor a llittyl drawyng of blod, yt cause & kyndeld 
venyme. And yf a man wolde not kytte many vaynes togiders, then 
let them kyepe open the vayne aboue reherssyd, as yt ys seyde 
byffore, tyl þe blod be reffreyned. Also, yf a man that be drawit 
blod, wheter he be inffect or not, let him beware of slepyng fro that 
tyme into the mydde nyght. 
 
[\f. 292\] And euer in that same syde where the boche ys, let the 
vayne be kutted. And yf the apostume do appyreth vnder the ryght 
harme, then let blod be draw in the myddel of that harme of þe 
myddel vayne. And yf yt be vnder the lefte harme, let him be 
drawe blod of the mydel vayne of that same harme, or ellys of the 
lyuer vayne, that ys be the lyttyl ffynger. And yf yt be abut the 
sharre, let the blod be drawen atte that same syde in the futte 
abutte the hankeleys. And yf that the boche be in the neke, let the 
blod be draw of the cephalica vayne about the thombe in the hande 
of that syde, or ellys in the myddel vayne of that same harme, or 
ellys in the hande of that syde, or ellys in the myddel vayne of that 
same harme, or ellys in the hande of that same syde abut the lyttyl 
ffynger. And yf the boche appyereth aboute the eerys, then let 
|P_280 
mynuyshe blod of the cephalica vayne of that syde, or ellys of the 
vayne that ys bethwyxte the thombe & [\f. 292v\] the nexte ffynger, 
that venemouse thinges shal not hurtte the braen, or ellys of the 
vayne that ys about the lesse ffynger, or ellys of the basilica vayne. 
And yf yt be in the shulders, let be boxsed, but ffurste let mynuyshe 
blod of the myddyl vayne. And yf in the bake, in lyke wyse as 
the tother. And halle this let be doune yf the man slepe not before 
the kenowyng of the boche. 
 
And yf he ffylleth the boche after the slepe, then you moste 
make a minucion of blod in the parte crucifixa ouerwarth, as yf the 
boche apyereth in the ryght syde, let be mynuyshed blod on the 
lefte syde, i. in þe lefte harme of the epatica vayne, or ellys of the 
basilica, or ellys of the myddel vayne. And yf yt sheode the boche 
vnder the [{lyfte{] harme, let be drawe blod of the [{right{] syde, and 
so in every place wher yt appyereth, let then be drawe blod euer on 
the contrary syde. 
 
And he that ys mynuyshed blod, yf that he be [\f. 293\] ffyeble, 
then he may take a slepe atte afternoon. And euer atte afternoon yt 
ys good for to go or ryde softely and moderately. And then 
afterwarde, yf þe boche douth growe, then let him put no doutte. 
For suche boche the perel ys passed, & bringe the man to helth. 
 
And forto make the apostume or boche lykely to breke, make 
your plaster in this wyse: Take the leuys of eldern & put therto 
mosterd sedys stamped, and make a plaster, & put vpon the boche. 
And summe surgerons wolde that tyriacle shulde be put therto, 
wher grettely Y pray you þat yt may not be so, but inwarde in 
drinkes let tyriacle be receuyd, & so yt douth expelle venime. 
 
Also, another remedye: Take houselyke (cerpille in Franche), 
serffenille, planteyn, & a llittyl of sutte, & bray halle thys togiders 
til the lycour cumme oute; then mengel that lycour with womens 
mylke, & yeue him to drinke, he that haue the boche, fastyngs, for 
yt wyl warke the better. 
|P_281 
Also, whan [\f. 293v\] ffurste the boche dow appyereth, let the 
pacyent receue inwarde hassell nuttes, fyges, & rue, and also oute-warde 
[{be{] made a plaster vpon. 
 
And atte thys tyme, yt suffice the forsayde doctrine for pestilence. 
And they that wyl be reule[{d{] after the seyng þat ys reherssyd 
of this contagiuse morbe & sekenes, and wyl eschaped, he shal 
with the grace of Ihesu Criste, that withoute hym no thynge may 
be down, the whiche ys myghty & omnipotent & gloriuse & laudable 
& blessed with the intemerat Virgine Maria, hys gloriuse 
mouder euerlastyng, fro the worldys in euerlastyng ffor euermore. 
Amen.
